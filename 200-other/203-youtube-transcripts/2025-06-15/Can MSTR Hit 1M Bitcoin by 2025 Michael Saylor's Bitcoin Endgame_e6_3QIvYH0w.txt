[00:00] it's still possible he could get to a
[00:01] million Bitcoin by the end of 2025 we
[00:04] would have to have another serious runup
[00:06] or two for that to happen you know in
[00:07] terms of the future I think it depends
[00:09] how you think it's going to play out
[00:10] like do we have still have a four-year
[00:12] cycle is 2026 a down year I don't think
[00:15] that self- custody ever really goes
[00:17] mainstream I think that probably it's
[00:19] only really the early adopter the tix
[00:21] saavy people maybe 10 to 15% of people
[00:23] in the world who ultimately wind up self
[00:25] custody the real Target that I've had my
[00:27] mind does a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[00:30] happen or not yeah I think that could be
[00:31] a cycle breaker if we're really going to
[00:33] move to a Bitcoin standard then
[00:34] everybody's going to have Bitcoin at
[00:36] some point corporation's going to have
[00:37] Bitcoin government's going to have
[00:38] Bitcoin everybody's going to have
[00:40] [Music]
[00:44] Bitcoin I'm really excited about it
[00:46] because like micro strategy is usually a
[00:48] topic that we we touch on in the podcast
[00:51] sometimes but not not like specifically
[00:53] I think like there were like two three
[00:54] episodes are did completely purely on on
[00:57] micro strategy um what excites you about
[01:00] about uh mic strategy and the connection
[01:03] to bitcoin sure I think you know if you
[01:05] believe in Bitcoin ultimately you want
[01:08] companies to adopt it and I think you
[01:10] know micro strategy has been by far the
[01:12] leader uh in doing that and I think that
[01:16] they're doing it in a way that kind of
[01:17] forces you to learn about traditional
[01:19] Finance um because you know they're
[01:21] borrowing money at sub 1% interest rates
[01:24] um you have to learn about how bonds
[01:25] work um you have to learn about um not
[01:28] even just bonds but like convertible Deb
[01:30] that and now you've got to learn about
[01:31] preferred stock and uh the types of
[01:34] entities that buy these different
[01:36] instruments and it really takes you down
[01:38] a whole another Rabbit Hole
[01:41] um that you you would might not
[01:43] necessarily see with Bitcoin that I
[01:45] think just makes you appreciate um the
[01:48] the Legacy Finance system that is
[01:50] attempting to replace that much more
[01:51] interesting yeah like the the Fiat games
[01:53] that are played on on top of Bitcoin and
[01:57] and he's really um I think he's really
[02:01] doing the the maximum that that's
[02:03] possible currently uh or or or would
[02:06] there be is the possibility to do even
[02:09] more I don't think he's he's gonna stop
[02:11] he's he's gonna you know as long as he
[02:13] can build his balance sheet and uh you
[02:17] know the bigger his balance sheet is the
[02:19] more he can more debt he can take on um
[02:22] and maintain the same or similar
[02:23] leverage ratios so uh you know it does
[02:26] get harder the the more volume he gets
[02:29] um you know if if micr strategy gets to
[02:32] a point or guess we're supposed to say
[02:34] strategy now but if they get to the
[02:35] point where they own say 2 million
[02:38] Bitcoin um you know four million Bitcoin
[02:40] five million Bitcoin you know at some
[02:41] point you've got to think it's difficult
[02:44] to to really move that needle much
[02:47] higher um but you know certainly there's
[02:49] still room to for him to stack is there
[02:52] any um like because you you have to take
[02:55] on depth and be basically he he gets
[02:58] future income into into the past um is
[03:02] there any level that
[03:04] Bitcoin uh would go to that micro
[03:06] strategy or strategy B uh gets in
[03:09] trouble or any
[03:12] significant um uh Revenue loss or income
[03:17] uh income loss that that would make them
[03:21] uh get in trouble or is that uh not that
[03:25] uh bad yeah maybe if I can share my
[03:29] screen here so I put out this post
[03:30] yesterday because I saw a lot of uh you
[03:33] know fud going around about micro
[03:34] strategies debt and I think a lot of
[03:36] people they're they're focusing on the
[03:38] wrong number they're looking at micro
[03:40] strategy average purchase price um which
[03:44] you know I F somewhere in the 60k range
[03:47] and people are worried that you know
[03:48] micro strategy if if Bitcoin goes down
[03:50] to 70k or 60k oh you know strategy is
[03:53] going to start getting liquidated and
[03:55] it's just it's just not right
[03:58] um that really the the two numbers that
[04:01] you need to look at are the conversion
[04:04] prices on the convertible bonds they've
[04:06] issued and their leverage
[04:08] ratio and if you look at just the the
[04:12] total amount of debt they have right now
[04:14] it's about 8.2 billion dollar and that's
[04:17] against $ 43.4 billion worth of bitcoin
[04:21] you know as of the time I put together
[04:22] this chart so that that's only a
[04:24] leverage ratio of about
[04:25] 19% and to put that in perspective if
[04:28] you go out and and buy a house and you
[04:31] put down a 20% down payment you've got a
[04:33] leverage ratio of 500% so that's much
[04:35] higher of course you the odds of your
[04:37] house going down in value 20% are you
[04:40] know less than the you know the odds of
[04:44] Bitcoin going down 20% um but really
[04:47] really the point I'm trying to make with
[04:48] this is that the leverage ratio is just
[04:51] it's just not as high as people make it
[04:52] out to be um whenever you see strategies
[04:56] debt talked about in the news people
[04:57] talk about it like they have so much
[04:58] debt that they're just going to you know
[05:00] Keel over if Bitcoin drops 5% and that's
[05:03] just not
[05:04] right and the second piece of this is uh
[05:07] both the maturities on these convertible
[05:09] bonds and also the conversion prices
[05:12] because if you look down the left hand
[05:14] column here the maturities the none of
[05:16] this debt even matures until
[05:18] 2028 and this is unsecured debt which uh
[05:23] what most people are familiar with in
[05:24] the Bitcoin lending space or the crypto
[05:26] lending space is these collateralized
[05:28] loans where
[05:30] you know maybe you take out the loan at
[05:32] 50 to 70% LTV or whatever it is and then
[05:36] if it drops below you know 25% 20% 15%
[05:39] whatever the liquidation threshold is
[05:42] this this Bitcoin that you put up as
[05:43] collateral just gets liquidated and um
[05:47] you know you lose all your Bitcoin but
[05:48] that's not what's going on here U these
[05:50] are unsecured loans there are there is
[05:53] no Bitcoin fled is collateral um there's
[05:56] no liquidation price now if if
[06:00] uh Bitcoin is or really if the the
[06:04] strategy price is lower than these
[06:06] conversion prices when you get towards
[06:08] conversion um that creates some
[06:10] difficulties um but it's still not
[06:12] necessarily the case that they' have to
[06:14] sell Bitcoin in order to make good um
[06:16] it's possible they could roll the debt
[06:19] or um you know there are other levers
[06:21] they can pull besides playing Bitcoin
[06:23] besides selling Bitcoin that's still
[06:25] possible they could sell
[06:26] Bitcoin but it's just it's just not as
[06:28] straightforward as that and uh just with
[06:32] the leverage ratio they've got right now
[06:34] uh you know Bitcoin would have to drop
[06:36] more than 80% in order for this in order
[06:38] for them to actually become fully
[06:40] insolvent like for mic strategy a going
[06:42] concern to to have any concerns about
[06:45] bankruptcy at all you know we'd have to
[06:47] see Bitcoin prices below
[06:50] $20,000 and I don't know about you but I
[06:52] just I don't think that's where we're
[06:53] headed I I don't think we'll ever see
[06:55] Bitcoin in that range again now it's
[06:58] possible but but you know if that
[07:01] happens uh I think
[07:03] there's you know the bit something has
[07:05] gone ay with with the Bitcoin narrative
[07:08] and of course micro strategy is it's you
[07:10] know it's a bet on it's a bet on bitcoin
[07:12] I mean so there's no surprises there but
[07:15] something
[07:15] else sorry go on yeah say something else
[07:19] interesting to call out about the debt
[07:21] they have right now is that uh you last
[07:24] time we checked the share price was
[07:26] about
[07:27] $255 uh you know it's down a little bit
[07:29] off the Highs but if you look at these
[07:30] conversion prices which is all the green
[07:33] boxes um four out of the six of their
[07:36] current outstanding convertible bonds
[07:37] are actually above their conversion
[07:39] prices still and and they have a lot of
[07:42] room to run so uh the actual effective
[07:47] leverage ratio they have on their debt
[07:48] right now is closer to about 11 and a
[07:50] half% because a lot of these bonds are
[07:53] almost like theyve fully converted to
[07:55] equity and it's really just the recent
[07:58] two convertible Bond
[08:00] that have strikes that are still really
[08:02] far out of the money interesting so what
[08:06] what I'm hearing is Michael CA could go
[08:09] even deeper with with strategy into
[08:11] Bitcoin absolutely and he said that his
[08:15] Target leverage ratio is 20 to
[08:18] 30% so right now we're not even at 20%
[08:22] so I think you know certainly by the end
[08:24] of the year but possibly even by the end
[08:25] of the quarter we'll see maybe one maybe
[08:29] two more convertible bonds uh attacked
[08:32] onto this probably
[08:33] another I would I I think probably two
[08:36] to three billion dollar convertible
[08:37] bonds one to two of those um we do
[08:40] probably need some help from the Bitcoin
[08:42] price it's going to be difficult to
[08:43] issue if if we keep sitting where we're
[08:46] at right now or if we dip further it
[08:48] could be difficult to issue those
[08:49] convertible bonds but um you know sailor
[08:52] is not done if we're still in a Bitcoin
[08:55] bull market like we think we are and we
[08:58] rebound off of the dip here um there
[09:01] there's definitely more debt coming and
[09:04] and even then if you think that his
[09:06] Target ratio is you know the highend of
[09:08] his R Target ratio is
[09:10] 30% then that still puts them in a
[09:12] situation where they could ride a 70%
[09:14] draw down in Bitcoin and still be
[09:17] solvent why is it easier in a bull
[09:19] market when we go up versus when we dip
[09:22] or have a bare Market one of the
[09:24] important things to realize about the
[09:25] way that they raise money with these
[09:26] convertible bonds and with their their
[09:28] out the money offerings and even at the
[09:31] market at the market offerings and even
[09:33] with the new um preferred stock that
[09:35] they've issued is that it's really it's
[09:37] all a function of the the premium over
[09:41] their Bitcoin Holdings that the shares
[09:43] are trading
[09:44] at and that tends to increase during
[09:48] bull markets you know when when Bitcoin
[09:51] goes up mic strategy goes up more and so
[09:53] this Arbitrage becomes more favorable
[09:56] and one of the things you always hear
[09:57] about is okay why did sor buy the top
[10:00] you know you hear people ragging him all
[10:02] the time saying he's such a horrible
[10:04] Trader because he's not buying the dips
[10:05] he's buying the tops well if he's buying
[10:07] the tops he's doing it right um if you
[10:09] see him buy the tops all the time that
[10:10] means he's got impeccable timing and
[10:13] he's taking advantage of this this
[10:15] Arbitrage of um you know mnav what
[10:19] people call it you know the M the
[10:20] multiple of the share price to the
[10:22] underlying Bitcoin
[10:23] Holdings um he's taking advantage of
[10:26] that when it's that it's most favorable
[10:29] interesting I never I never knew that um
[10:33] how many Bitcoin do you think he can
[10:35] possibly reach I mean he's he he he
[10:38] reached already way more than I
[10:40] anticipated probably he he surprised
[10:43] already some people uh if like starting
[10:46] in in 2020 uh and and now he already has
[10:49] a considerable amount of of of Bitcoin
[10:52] um H how how much can he
[10:55] accumulate yeah absolutely I think you
[10:57] know I'm about as bullish micro
[10:59] strategies to come and it it took me by
[11:01] surprise just how fast he was able to
[11:02] accumulate last fall I think it's it's
[11:05] it's still possible he could get to a
[11:07] million Bitcoin by the end of 2025 we
[11:09] would have to have you know another
[11:11] serious runup or two for that to happen
[11:14] but I I still think that's possible you
[11:17] know in terms of the future I think it
[11:18] depends how you think it's going to play
[11:19] out like do we have still have a
[11:21] four-year cycle is 2026 a down year um
[11:24] you know if 2026 um you know 2027 if
[11:27] those are down years orow
[11:29] years um then he probably won't be able
[11:32] to do a lot of the activity he does that
[11:37] um enables him to purchase the Bitcoin
[11:39] that he does like if you look at the B
[11:41] last bare Market uh there are basically
[11:43] no convertible bonds issued for about
[11:44] two years um they did take uh cash flow
[11:48] from operations and put that into
[11:49] Bitcoin but there was this this kind of
[11:51] off period the other hand if the cycle
[11:53] is broken if if there is no you know big
[11:55] draw down 2026 and we just we we grind
[11:58] higher or we just experience smaller
[12:01] divs from here and out um that changes
[12:04] the story quite a
[12:05] bit um you in terms of the max cap you
[12:09] can achieve you know it's hard to say um
[12:12] the higher bitcoin price goes it's the
[12:15] harder it becomes just in terms of you
[12:18] know dollar amount to be able to buy the
[12:20] Bitcoin um because you know if you think
[12:24] you know Bitcoin is $100,000 now and you
[12:27] sell $300,000
[12:29] worth of stock and you buy you know
[12:31] three Bitcoin that's different than
[12:33] selling $3 million doll worth of stock
[12:36] to buy three Bitcoin it it just becomes
[12:38] harder to move that amount of capital
[12:40] into the system so I I think that's kind
[12:43] of where the at some point you do hit
[12:47] diminishing returns but I think you know
[12:49] we're not we're not there yet I think
[12:51] he's still got a clear Runway to a
[12:52] million Bitcoin and perhaps
[12:54] Beyond so dimin you you don't subscribe
[12:57] to the diminishing return theory of like
[13:00] we we get Le less and less returns every
[13:02] year well you know what I would say
[13:05] about this is I think it's it's uh it's
[13:06] not an issue of like will we have
[13:08] diminishing returns it's an issue of
[13:10] your time frame you know Bitcoin can't
[13:11] go up 30% kager forever uh micro
[13:14] strategy can't stack you know 50% more
[13:17] Bitcoin every year forever um but you
[13:20] know what what is the time frame of that
[13:22] slowdown look like you know do we have
[13:24] another five years do we have another 10
[13:25] years I you know frankly I don't know
[13:27] exactly what the answer to that is but I
[13:29] think we still got you know some some
[13:31] good Runway ahead of us interesting um
[13:33] you also brought up the the cycles and
[13:36] and they are as consistent as they they
[13:38] could be in in in in the past 16 years
[13:41] basically where we always have like
[13:43] three up years and then one down year uh
[13:46] and and we are now kind of in the in the
[13:49] in the last up year so if if everything
[13:52] continues the the way this continues uh
[13:54] I think 2096 would be a down year if I'm
[13:57] not mistaken or is like 20 I think 2026
[14:00] is the the one where it's supposed to go
[14:03] down because the last three years were
[14:05] were up years and this year should be up
[14:07] here um and I think we we should be
[14:11] careful with like just putting that
[14:15] pattern across uh the next uh 20 years
[14:20] uh because the pattern very much could
[14:21] also break especially as
[14:24] Bitcoin changes a lot like the the
[14:27] mining having impact
[14:29] is um is is getting less and less and
[14:32] also the buyers of Bitcoin and the
[14:35] behaviors are changing like micro
[14:37] strategy uh is not selling Bitcoin in6
[14:40] if they are not absolutely forced to I
[14:42] guess so um so with more institutional
[14:45] money coming in um what what what what
[14:47] chances do you give it that we actually
[14:50] break out of that cycle and 2096 maybe
[14:53] it's not a a crazy year but maybe it's
[14:55] just like a 5% up year or something like
[14:58] that
[14:59] sure you know the the the real Target
[15:02] that I've had in my mind you know
[15:04] probably all year is that uh does a
[15:08] strategic Bitcoin Reserve happen or not
[15:11] I think that could be a cycle breaker um
[15:14] my hunch is that you know just be honest
[15:16] I I do not think the Strategic Bitcoin
[15:18] Reserve is going to happen but you know
[15:20] if it did that would be the event that I
[15:22] could see you know triggering a break in
[15:24] the four-year
[15:25] cycle um you know it's still possible
[15:29] that the that we do have a down year in
[15:31] 2026 but it's much smaller you know
[15:33] instead of 70 80% maybe 40 50% and that
[15:36] you that would still be consistent with
[15:37] a four-year cycle but you know it's hard
[15:40] to say it's hard to say and I think a
[15:42] lot of it um you know it depends whether
[15:45] or not it was really the having that's
[15:46] been driving these Cycles or it's Global
[15:48] liquidity you know if we get a different
[15:50] pattern in global liquidity you know
[15:53] perhaps we could see a different pattern
[15:54] in Bitcoin emerge I tend to be a
[15:56] believer that uh you know this time
[15:59] isn't different until we see that this
[16:00] time is different but you know you never
[16:02] know until it actually happens yeah you
[16:05] kind of I'm searching for the picture
[16:08] but uh I think that's a that that's a
[16:11] that's a great one um there uh I will I
[16:16] will just quickly share that also with
[16:18] with people for for the few people that
[16:21] might not know what what we're talking
[16:23] about um this is kind of like the The
[16:27] Cycle Theory
[16:29] uh the cycle how how it always was in
[16:32] the in the past years uh where we have
[16:35] that one bare year it was 2011 14 18
[16:39] 2022 H and then we have always three
[16:43] consecutive years that go up after that
[16:46] so we had like 2093 2094 and now also
[16:50] 2095 uh and up here obviously that's a
[16:53] outdated chart because we're already in
[16:55] 2094 so logically if if we can just
[16:58] continue the the past Cycles uh the the
[17:01] next year would be a down year uh
[17:05] Bitcoin is always kind of uh like you
[17:09] cannot predict Bitcoin what's what
[17:11] Bitcoin is doing uh to a certain extent
[17:13] you can do here but it could be very
[17:16] much be the case that this doesn't
[17:18] happen um and this does change uh so I'm
[17:23] I'm really excited about 2026 I think
[17:25] 2025 will be a great year but I think
[17:27] 2026 will be uh much more interesting of
[17:30] like okay what happens and and do we
[17:33] follow the same patterns or uh does now
[17:36] because institutions came in uh change
[17:39] things and institutions came exactly
[17:41] around this between 2020 and and now
[17:44] basically in so they getting really now
[17:46] in full swing we have since starting of
[17:49] 2093 the the the Bitcoin ETF and and
[17:52] many more things like the sa 20 121 uh
[17:57] and stuff like that that that got
[17:58] removed uh so we have a lot of things uh
[18:02] that are kind of happening where
[18:05] maybe maybe that cycle breaks and I
[18:08] think then then it would be really crazy
[18:10] great yeah it could happen and then yeah
[18:12] I mean you always want to
[18:15] be What's the phrase you know opinions
[18:19] uh strong opinions loosely held so you
[18:21] always want to see what actually happens
[18:23] and and I think it's an open question
[18:24] right if if the institutional buyers
[18:26] really are here you know how sticky is
[18:28] that
[18:29] uh
[18:30] how uh you know how prone to momentum
[18:34] chasing are the types of Institutions to
[18:36] get involved these are unanswered
[18:38] questions and you know the the approach
[18:40] I take is um you rather than trying to
[18:42] say this is exactly how I think it's
[18:43] going to play out I thinking these are
[18:46] the trends I'm looking to see how play
[18:47] out so that we learn what the answers
[18:49] are uh and you know if it turns out it's
[18:52] an upe amazing if it turns out it's a
[18:54] down Year I'll back up the truck you
[18:55] know I've got a plan either
[18:56] way absolutely uh what do you think
[19:00] people don't understand or even like
[19:02] bitcoiners don't understand enough about
[19:05] micro strategy what what are your most
[19:07] frustrated with with uh even talking
[19:10] with Bitcoin as about micro strategy
[19:12] sure I I think that's you know one of
[19:15] the one of the big frustrations we
[19:16] already talked about was just not really
[19:17] understanding you know how the debt
[19:19] Works in how in kind of this this this
[19:23] wrong idea that they're so overleveraged
[19:26] when actually right now they're very
[19:26] underleveraged um so that that's one and
[19:30] I think another one is a lot of Bitcoin
[19:32] they just don't like the idea of a
[19:33] corporation owning a lot of Bitcoin you
[19:35] know especially some of the the
[19:36] bitcoiners have been around longer um
[19:39] and I empathize with this to a degree
[19:41] you know they got into it for
[19:42] peer-to-peer money and if Bitcoin owning
[19:44] a lot of a corporation owning a lot of
[19:47] Bitcoin you know just just rubs in the
[19:49] wrong way like oh this is you know the
[19:50] system taking over we're anti-stem but I
[19:53] I think that type of thinking it it it's
[19:58] while I can empathize with it I I think
[20:00] that you know if if Bitcoin is if we're
[20:02] really going to move to a Bitcoin
[20:03] standard then everybody's going to have
[20:05] Bitcoin at some point corporations is
[20:06] going to have Bitcoin government's
[20:08] goingon to have Bitcoin everybody's
[20:09] going to have Bitcoin and it's it's just
[20:12] not going to be the case that you know
[20:15] it's only people who have it only
[20:18] private citizens holding Bitcoin and
[20:19] their private wallets and that you know
[20:21] corporations they don't hold any they're
[20:23] only going to deal in fil in Fiat while
[20:25] all the rest of us deal with Bitcoin
[20:27] yeah it's just not the way it's going to
[20:28] out so
[20:31] um yeah I think just more acceptance of
[20:36] Corporations getting it on the game and
[20:38] and seeing that really is a positive for
[20:41] the space rather than a negative is what
[20:43] um I would hope for yeah it's kind of
[20:46] annoying when when people say like oh
[20:48] like they shouldn't buy Bitcoin like
[20:49] Bitcoin is for everyone like you you
[20:52] want hyperbitcoinization but you don't
[20:54] want companies to buy Bitcoin like
[20:57] what's up like there's some there's some
[20:59] Gap in between if if if you want to if
[21:01] you want Bitcoin to succeed but you
[21:04] don't want uh some institutions or some
[21:09] uh parts of people not buying Bitcoin
[21:12] then there's like a gap in between those
[21:14] things like either Bitcoin is a a niche
[21:17] cyber Punk thing where only like there's
[21:20] like only an underground economy which
[21:23] uh yeah is fine but I think that's not
[21:25] what Bitcoin is Bitcoin is the money
[21:27] Revolution um uh and in that case if
[21:30] Bitcoin is actually the money Revolution
[21:32] and Bitcoin is actually this this
[21:33] hyperbitcoinization thing actually
[21:36] happens then also your enemies will have
[21:38] Bitcoin and also corporations and maybe
[21:40] even nation states will have Bitcoin and
[21:42] and you you kind of have to deal with
[21:44] that and you had enough chance now to
[21:46] accumulate or you will have more chances
[21:48] to accumulate in in in the future yeah
[21:51] absolutely and I think this is it's
[21:53] something that's not unique to bitcoin I
[21:54] think it's just it's part of like this
[21:56] meta pattern that you see in movements
[21:58] you know the early movement tends to be
[22:00] like the early adopters this really
[22:02] hardcore crowd and then you know no
[22:05] movement survives contact with the
[22:07] mainstream without being radically
[22:09] transformed and I think this this this U
[22:13] this kind of culture conflict if you
[22:14] want to call it that was always coming
[22:16] and you know I think you just have to
[22:18] trust that what what comes out the other
[22:20] side um makes the world incrementally
[22:23] better and um you know probably one of
[22:26] the
[22:27] the um um more contrarian opinions I
[22:30] hold is that I I don't think that self-
[22:34] custody ever really goes mainstream I
[22:38] think that probably it's only really the
[22:40] early adopters the tix savy people maybe
[22:42] 10 to 15% of people in the world who
[22:45] ultimately wind up self- custody and um
[22:49] either either that is enough to keep the
[22:52] system honest to to prevent um you know
[22:55] runaway fractional banking problems that
[22:58] that people are hoping will get resolved
[23:00] um and any other kind of paper Bitcoin
[23:03] problems either it's enough to keep that
[23:04] in check or it's not and I think Bitcoin
[23:07] kind of has to stand or fall on that and
[23:09] if you're thinking about designing the
[23:10] system uh you're thinking about what
[23:13] what what upgrades can go into Bitcoin
[23:14] or what kind of services to build on top
[23:16] of it I think that is really the
[23:18] challenge to think about you know the
[23:20] the marketing problem of you know how do
[23:22] we how do we convince eight billion
[23:23] people to self custody I I don't think
[23:25] that's the right challenge to tackle
[23:27] because it's you just you're just not
[23:29] going to get there um I think the
[23:31] challenge to tackle is how do we build
[23:32] this system in such a way that it's
[23:33] still very robust if uh really only 15%
[23:37] of people are like hardcore you know
[23:39] self custody hodlers why do you think um
[23:42] we will not get to um a mainstream self-
[23:45] custody solution where maybe like 50% or
[23:48] 60% hold hold their own Keys um well so
[23:52] one of the ironic things about
[23:55] um really kind of like one of the
[23:57] tensions is that if you got this system
[23:59] where you know self- cussing is you have
[24:01] to some people hard um um of course you
[24:04] know people scof that oh it's not so
[24:05] hard you just Miz 12 12 words um or you
[24:09] know you think about the type of person
[24:12] who loses their password all the time um
[24:15] and there's a lot of people or the type
[24:16] of person that they keep their password
[24:17] as a sticky note on the monitor these
[24:19] are people who are putting their life
[24:22] savings in something that they could you
[24:25] know easily lose is is a horrible idea
[24:28] um they need at minimum they need some
[24:30] kind of collaborative custody solution
[24:32] and and it could be the case that we get
[24:34] really good collaborative custody
[24:35] solutions that make this a lot easier
[24:37] for people you know I'm a big fan of
[24:39] companies like Unchained and um so if
[24:43] you know I can see a world where
[24:44] collaborative custody Solutions get much
[24:46] better to the point where a lar a much
[24:49] larger percentage of people are uh using
[24:52] Solutions like that um and um yeah I
[24:55] don't know exactly what the solutions
[24:57] look like but um yeah sure yeah there's
[25:00] potential there
[25:01] absolutely I I do like also um I mean I
[25:06] don't use it myself and uh if if you are
[25:08] hardcore and tax heavy and and a Bitcoin
[25:11] I I maybe it's not the best wallet uh
[25:14] but I do like for Norm is the bit key um
[25:18] and their setup with like your phone the
[25:21] bit key and their servers it's like
[25:23] basically a two out of three multi uh
[25:26] and it's so simple it's like an apple
[25:28] device uh and uh I like if I have any
[25:34] doubt that a person probably loses it if
[25:37] they use anything else I either go um if
[25:40] they have a small amount with
[25:42] recommending bit key or if they have a
[25:45] high amount with collaborative custody
[25:47] or uh with something like the Bitcoin
[25:49] way where where they can actually uh get
[25:51] someone to explain them one step by time
[25:55] with them depending on what they want to
[25:56] do um uh but I think uh the mainstream
[26:01] way uh is could be something like bit
[26:05] key so like having like an extra device
[26:08] which just has a fingerprint or like
[26:10] something else and no no screen nothing
[26:12] confusing and you just hold it to your
[26:14] phone and it's really easy uh that's
[26:16] where I think we could go to mainstream
[26:19] s ctive thing but I do agree with you
[26:23] that I see a hard road to there like I
[26:26] even now in Bitcoin if you ask most
[26:28] bitcoiners on like on a random big let's
[26:31] see I I will be in Vegas uh and there
[26:33] like a lot of bitcoiners there I
[26:36] wouldn't be surprised if not even half
[26:38] of those bitcoiners have stuff custody
[26:40] like I think most bitcoiners actually
[26:42] don't do that uh and there are some
[26:44] evidence to that there like hardware
[26:46] sales and the wallet addresses and and
[26:48] stuff like that there uh and uh and they
[26:51] make service and around that so even now
[26:54] even the early grow is not that much
[26:56] into self- custody even though I push
[26:59] self custody as much as I can
[27:01] so I hope we see self custody but I I
[27:05] kind of agree with you we probably won't
[27:07] see that much and the point I want be
[27:09] clear about is that you know I think we
[27:10] should encourage everyone you know I
[27:12] think self- custody should be heavily
[27:13] encouraged I think we should encourage
[27:15] everyone who can do it to do it so I'm
[27:17] definitely not um I'm definitely fully
[27:20] in favor of self- custody I just think
[27:22] that empirically it will probably be the
[27:23] case that you a large percent of people
[27:26] don't and you know I'm also a big fan
[27:28] the bit key I think um is definitely one
[27:30] of the easier solutions for for
[27:32] onboarding new people to Hardware
[27:35] wallets absolutely and also something
[27:38] affordable because I do like also like
[27:40] Unchained Kasa um I recommend a lot also
[27:44] the Bitcoin way uh if people really want
[27:46] to learn it also themselves and and do
[27:48] it and stuff like that but um it having
[27:53] a an a cheaper option and I don't know
[27:55] what the bit key cost and they're not
[27:57] sponsoring by the way but I do like the
[27:59] the solutions they I don't know like 100
[28:01] or something like that they're not that
[28:03] expensive also uh where you don't have
[28:05] to pay like €2,000 EUR per year or
[28:07] something like that some of the other
[28:09] offers uh so it's an interesting
[28:12] definitely interesting option um how
[28:14] important do you see overall that the
[28:17] bridging technology between uh feed and
[28:21] Bitcoin be like an ETF being like other
[28:24] Technologies where we kind of have the
[28:27] bridge between Bitcoin and and fear sure
[28:30] I think um you know probably we're going
[28:32] to see many different iterations of that
[28:34] over you know the long Arc of 10 20 30
[28:37] years
[28:39] um I think that's
[28:42] uh you just kind of in my mind the way
[28:45] um you know the progression from you
[28:47] know Bitcoin as you know store value to
[28:50] Medi exchange plays out is
[28:52] eventually um enough people just because
[28:55] right now if you want to buy something
[28:56] with Bitcoin you know it's hard to
[28:59] it's hard to find people that will
[29:00] accept it still I mean you can go on
[29:02] directories and you can intentially go
[29:03] places where Bitcoin is
[29:05] accepted but um you can just walk in any
[29:09] old store and use it and I think
[29:10] eventually the the road to medium
[29:11] exchange is that eventually enough
[29:13] people have it that and they are storing
[29:17] their wealth in it they're keeping their
[29:18] Savings in it that instead of wanting to
[29:20] cash out into Fiat uh and then spend it
[29:23] they'll just be like okay what well I
[29:25] have Bitcoin you have Bitcoin why don't
[29:26] we just exchange and I think that's
[29:28] really when you start to see like Mass
[29:30] market demand pick up for more Peter
[29:33] Peter type Solutions um and um I think
[29:38] the path to that you know Starts Now
[29:40] with more with things like
[29:42] ETFs
[29:44] um um and you know is is as much as
[29:49] people don't like you know custodial
[29:50] Bitcoin Solutions um I think these these
[29:53] Bridges form a vital link and getting to
[29:55] the point where enough people just just
[29:56] have Bitcoin on hand and that that it's
[29:59] it's widespread enough that it can
[30:02] become a widespread medium exchange at
[30:04] some point I partnered up with coin
[30:07] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:10] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:12] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:15] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[30:18] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:21] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[30:24] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:27] watch is Bitcoin only and coin vigilante
[30:31] just dropped a completely new and
[30:33] amazing Genesis edition of their watch
[30:37] collections you have the date of the
[30:39] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[30:42] and of course also the block height and
[30:45] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[30:48] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:51] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:53] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:57] down in the descriptions I love those
[30:59] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:02] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:05] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[31:08] and now the most important step is to
[31:10] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[31:13] hardware wallet my personal
[31:15] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:17] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:19] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:21] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[31:24] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:28] account with the code Robin at the
[31:29] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[31:34] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[31:36] to really level up your sovereignty as
[31:39] an individual you have to have the most
[31:41] secure self- custody setup you have to
[31:44] secure your own devices you have to
[31:47] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:50] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:52] where you live you even want to have a
[31:55] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:57] in case something goes really really
[31:59] wrong and through all those steps the

[32:07] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[32:10] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[32:13] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:16] interesting uh by the way one one other
[32:19] thing is um uh because we talked about
[32:22] altcoin uh we talked about Cycles before
[32:26] uh one thing that Al get a lot in the
[32:28] comments is like oh like why don't you
[32:30] buy some altcoins to get more Bitcoin
[32:32] which always is like like no I want
[32:35] Bitcoin um but I hear now a lot of the
[32:38] same arguments around micro strategy of
[32:40] like oh I want to I buy now micro
[32:43] strategy to to get more Bitcoin in the
[32:44] long run basically they they using a
[32:48] micro strategy almost like um a leverage
[32:52] Bitcoin position to to a certain extent
[32:54] I mean it
[32:55] is in many ways a leverage Bitcoin
[32:57] position
[32:58] um do you do you feel a that it's it's a
[33:02] fair fair assumption to see micro
[33:05] strategy as leverage Bitcoin and B do
[33:07] you see the altcoin season more and more
[33:11] switching to actual Bitcoin Associated
[33:15] products like a micro strategy maybe
[33:18] like a uh Bitcoin ETF where only Bitcoin
[33:22] companies are in there like there things
[33:24] like that forming and and that kind of
[33:26] stealing the funer of of of Al coins
[33:30] yeah absolutely I do think that's I
[33:31] think we're seeing that happen now um
[33:34] that you know if you so if if you just
[33:37] you know start from okay if the goal is
[33:39] accumulating more
[33:40] Bitcoin um and your choices are invest
[33:44] in some you know other coin just just
[33:47] because you think there's going to be
[33:48] like a pump end up there and you think
[33:49] you can catch the top or you invest in a
[33:52] company that's buying Bitcoin and
[33:55] increasing their Holdings of Bitcoin you
[33:57] one of those just is a much more direct
[33:59] path towards greater Bitcoin
[34:01] exposure um
[34:05] and I think I don't know that the market
[34:09] will support you know a huge
[34:11] proliferation of these like at some
[34:13] point the the the offerings tend to um
[34:16] not be very differentiated you know if
[34:18] you got micro strategy if they're
[34:20] they're Levering up to buy Bitcoin SAR
[34:22] is Levering up to buy Bitcoin um yeah by
[34:24] the time you get to you know the 10th
[34:26] player doing that um maybe you've got
[34:30] you know a harder
[34:32] time turning That Into You know a
[34:34] compelling bet but um to the extent
[34:38] these companies are out there they're
[34:40] running these plays um and it's just
[34:44] it's a much more obvious direct
[34:47] connection to more Bitcoin Holdings and
[34:50] also it's it's a regulated product um
[34:54] you know maybe some people aren't
[34:55] excited about regulated products but uh
[34:57] There's an actual like company there
[34:59] there's a business behind it that's
[35:00] buying Bitcoin it's not just some token
[35:02] created out of thin air that you're that
[35:04] you're betting that you can be smarter
[35:05] than everyone else and cash out at the
[35:07] top of the pump and dump it's it's
[35:10] sometimes I'm I'm uh I'm I'm kind of
[35:12] fatted by
[35:14] like why are there not more businesses
[35:17] doing that like there are similar
[35:18] scientific there are like other
[35:20] companies that that that do the micro
[35:22] strategy or the the strategy B Playbook
[35:25] uh what do you think is holding more
[35:28] companies back from from doing exactly
[35:31] that we now have almost 5 years of
[35:33] strategy b or like mic strategy doing
[35:36] that and it's so obvious that's a good
[35:40] idea yeah I think the uh from the from
[35:43] the conversations I've had and the
[35:45] things I've heard it most it comes down
[35:47] it's very difficult to get um your your
[35:50] corporate board um to buy into it so you
[35:54] really have to have you know a special
[35:56] type of board
[35:58] uh one of the things uh you know Michael
[36:00] sailor had going for him was that you
[36:01] know he had more than 50% of the Voting
[36:04] Rights so once he decided that he was
[36:07] going all in at Bitcoin you know they
[36:08] were going all in Bitcoin and you know
[36:11] he could just vote that into existence
[36:13] single-handedly um you know if you don't
[36:16] have that same kind of concentration of
[36:18] voting power you know in you know in a
[36:21] founder or if you just you can't get
[36:24] widespread buying on your board it's
[36:27] very difficult to to push the play
[36:30] through because um you there's still
[36:32] career risk you know if you go out you
[36:34] buy Bitcoin and U let's say you even get
[36:37] the timing right you're you're you're
[36:38] you're buying a year two three four of a
[36:40] cycle and Cycles are still a thing then
[36:42] that down year comes memories are very
[36:44] short you know what happens after you
[36:46] know 50 60 70% drw down in Bitcoin
[36:49] somebody's going to get fired probably
[36:51] but then the same token like memories
[36:53] are short the next year Bitcoin
[36:56] rebounds it's back up to alltime highs
[36:58] you the copy looks scrap then what
[37:00] happened to that guy who's already fired
[37:02] do they do they bring him back I mean
[37:03] what what happens then right um yeah I
[37:07] think it's it's it's difficult to get
[37:08] boards to buy into Bitcoin and it's also
[37:13] like difficult to I think just just just
[37:16] stick to the path have a four-year time
[37:19] Horizon um not get shaken out especially
[37:22] if you've got you know members of the
[37:24] board who are enemies to the strategy
[37:25] who are who are just going to to
[37:28] end um during down parts
[37:31] so um yeah long story short it's I think
[37:34] it really just comes down to having a
[37:35] team they can execute it and believe in
[37:36] it so what you're saying is basically
[37:40] that the career risk of um embracing
[37:44] Bitcoin and being and shaking the
[37:47] company up and having maybe on the back
[37:50] end of this kind of career risk because
[37:54] you're proposing something abnormal
[37:56] something maybe that other people see is
[37:59] risky that is still too high and the
[38:02] career risk did not flip to it's a
[38:04] career risk to propose Bitcoin it's to
[38:06] to the career risk of like it's a career
[38:09] risk not to adop bitcoin yeah exactly
[38:13] you know if we get to that flipping
[38:14] point where shareholders are like why
[38:17] you know micro strategy just just you
[38:20] know 40x they're company the past few
[38:22] years why aren't we doing that you if
[38:23] you get to the point where those those
[38:24] kind of conversations are coming up and
[38:26] they're very serious and shareholders
[38:28] are very serious about it um that can
[38:30] flip the script for sure um but you know
[38:33] we're we're we're not there yet but you
[38:35] know perhaps we'll get there
[38:37] someday I I think
[38:39] we there has to come that point where
[38:43] it's so obvious uh also in the
[38:45] mainstream where shareholders and and
[38:48] and people say like oh like what's your
[38:50] Bitcoin strategy and if you don't have a
[38:52] good answer like you're like oh like
[38:54] okay I'm I'm not investing in that
[38:56] company or like you're not a good good
[38:57] fit for the CFO role or something like
[38:59] that so like there's that that career
[39:02] risk flipping point where you have to
[39:04] know about Bitcoin and you have to have
[39:06] a good strategy around it uh otherwise
[39:09] uh you don't have any credibility as a
[39:12] CFO or CEO or a board member of a
[39:15] company or something like that sure and
[39:17] and I think probably the way it will
[39:18] look will be a a little bit different
[39:20] because you know not everybody's going
[39:22] to do the full micro strategy Playbook
[39:25] and lever up and take on convertible
[39:26] bonds you probably what it looks like is
[39:29] we get more and more companies that have
[39:31] you know a 3 to 5% Bitcoin
[39:33] allocation and maybe that that grows
[39:35] over time and it it just becomes like a
[39:37] standard treasury asset and I I think
[39:40] that's probably more the manifestation
[39:42] that it will take um for for most
[39:45] companies and um yeah I I do agree and
[39:49] uh and we already seeing now uh
[39:53] companies that are not big on the radar
[39:56] when you talk to exchanges when when you
[39:58] talk to their uh uh P2P clients and and
[40:02] they're like yeah like they're just
[40:03] sacking they're like they having they
[40:05] having some some goal of like stacking I
[40:08] don't know like five Bitcoin per per
[40:09] month or something like that uh with
[40:11] some of the extra cash flow like that's
[40:13] fine like you know not every company has
[40:17] to go full on in Bitcoin and go on every
[40:20] podcast talk about it and stuff like
[40:21] that there are a lot of like smaller or
[40:24] like mider companies that are not
[40:27] publicly traded they're maybe
[40:28] familyowned and they're like hey like we
[40:31] want Bitcoin on our balance sheet we
[40:33] want to have like I don't know 10%
[40:35] allocation of our balance sheet in
[40:37] Bitcoin uh and that's probably uh those
[40:41] companies are in numbers probably more
[40:43] than the companies that go all
[40:45] in and and and do everything uh but it's
[40:50] it's boring to talk about them that's
[40:51] why nobody's talking about them uh
[40:54] because when you have like mic strategy
[40:56] takers like all in and they're doing
[40:57] everything 100% there's no headline in
[41:00] writing like oh that random company is
[41:02] converting 5% of their balance sheet
[41:04] like like nobody's talking about them
[41:06] because they're boring yeah absolutely
[41:09] it's like can make headlines when you
[41:10] know company XYZ acquires 3% allocation
[41:13] of Bitcoin and well well I guess the
[41:15] other thing to point out is that you
[41:17] know every time you know these 13 FS
[41:19] come out the companies disclose what
[41:20] they're holding the companies that have
[41:23] you know Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[41:24] you know typically you know mostly
[41:25] Bitcoin ETFs um at this stage um that
[41:30] number is growing every every quarter
[41:32] when you you get the 13 half season and
[41:34] those filings come out there more and
[41:35] more companies with Bitcoin in the
[41:36] balance stre and that's just the public
[41:37] companies you know it's hard to
[41:40] say you know how much how many of the
[41:42] private companies out there are are you
[41:44] know quietly stacking Bitcoin in their
[41:45] balance sheets and you you know I know
[41:48] that you know companies like you know
[41:51] you know River and Swan um um you know
[41:55] these Bitcoin Finance Bitcoin only
[41:56] financial services companies they're
[41:58] onboarding companies they're helping
[42:00] them with their treasuries and
[42:03] um yeah it's it's
[42:07] happening yeah it's private companies
[42:09] also usually have an easier time to do
[42:12] that uh from from my perspective because
[42:15] they usually don't
[42:17] have the the structure and the the head
[42:21] of it is usually smaller and Slimmer uh
[42:24] and it's it's not so many more people
[42:27] that talk about it and uh they they have
[42:30] usually an easier way to decide
[42:32] something like that uh and a and a
[42:34] quicker way to decide something like
[42:36] that at least of of like how how I see
[42:38] it and I think there are a lot of pro I
[42:40] mean I know actually like because I
[42:42] talked with the K exchanges and talk
[42:43] with uh some of the the people that that
[42:46] talked with the P2P clients and they
[42:48] like oh yeah like there's this company
[42:50] there in this rural area they like just
[42:52] stacking 20 Bitcoin and they're doing
[42:54] nothing even internet related is I'm
[42:57] Industrial company they just have cash
[42:59] flow over and they want to Stack Bitcoin
[43:01] with that and and that's that's amazing
[43:03] because they actually just use it as
[43:06] money and and and that's great like
[43:08] that's what Bitcoin is right like we
[43:10] want we want bitcoiners and we want
[43:12] people and and companies to just stack
[43:14] Bitcoin and use it as what it is
[43:16] supposed to be like store of value maybe
[43:18] down the road media of exchange maybe
[43:19] down the road more than that but right
[43:21] now it's through value phase so they
[43:23] will use it as as exactly that and it's
[43:26] it's great to see I I I like that how do
[43:28] you see this adoption moving forward
[43:30] it's like we we're now already at the
[43:32] point where private companies are buying
[43:34] it uh large public companies buying it
[43:37] we haven't seen like an apple or
[43:38] something like that like the closest
[43:40] thing is probably Tesla that owns still
[43:42] like 10,000 Bitcoin or something like
[43:43] that which is small amount for for their
[43:46] size but what do you see in the IND
[43:49] option Cycles moving forward when do you
[43:51] think we hit that point where we really
[43:54] have a lot of companies uh in Bitcoin
[43:57] sure and one of the interesting things
[44:00] for me to watch a corporate adoption
[44:02] playing out is it it seems to be a
[44:03] similar Grassroots bottom up type of
[44:07] adoption and um you you just within
[44:10] private citizens it was you know mostly
[44:12] small retail investors eventually more
[44:14] and more bigger players got involved and
[44:16] I think you're seeing that same thing
[44:17] apply out companies right now it's it's
[44:19] the smaller private
[44:20] companies um not not so much interest
[44:23] from you know like the mag 7 companies
[44:25] except for you know Tesla's position and
[44:28] you know I think that you know those
[44:30] large companies they probably come much
[44:31] later on I think you've seen the same
[44:33] pattern in with government adoption too
[44:36] you see El Salvador see the um you know
[44:38] Bhutan um these you know these smaller
[44:42] countries that are looking for different
[44:44] ways to improve their um standing um
[44:47] it's it's more appealing to them um
[44:51] before some of the larger countries get
[44:52] involved you know if it would actually
[44:54] be a major pattern disruptor if if the
[44:57] if the US actually did establish a
[44:59] strategic Bitcoin Reserve because all of
[45:01] a sudden you you'd be flipping the
[45:02] script and' be going top down instead of
[45:04] bottom
[45:04] up but um yeah just in terms of broad
[45:07] Strokes I think that's that's what it
[45:09] looks like is first you capture the long
[45:11] tail you capture the bid market and then
[45:13] and then Bitcoin adoption just just
[45:14] keeps working its way up Market to to
[45:17] larger players and larger pools of
[45:18] capital absolutely and it's like a slow
[45:21] slow adoption and it uh I love the I
[45:24] love that how how you compe with like
[45:26] the Grassroots movement I never looked
[45:28] at that way interesting I I I like that
[45:32] and it's also um when we think about
[45:34] Bitcoin overall um you you have so many
[45:37] interesting stories I I think I saw
[45:41] probably I think it was you actually
[45:43] that I saw it uh with GameStop uh you
[45:46] made some tweet where uh they they would
[45:51] be so cool to move into Bitcoin just
[45:53] because of the story I mean they have
[45:55] also a lot of money to move into Bitcoin
[45:57] but uh the the story of GameStop uh
[46:01] being uh the short story and having the
[46:04] documentations and stuff like that I
[46:06] think even Netflix documentations are
[46:08] around that that that stock now um and
[46:12] continuing that story with being fully
[46:16] flashed a Bitcoin company I mean they're
[46:18] not there yet but like if they convert
[46:20] Bitcoin and they're like doing some
[46:21] Bitcoin strategy and like Michael saor
[46:24] met now with Ryan uh that would be one
[46:27] hack of a thing how do you look at the
[46:30] possible GameStop move yeah it be
[46:33] interesting and they have around um5
[46:35] billion worth of cash um on hand so if
[46:40] they were to go place you know5 billion
[46:42] dollar Bitcoin smash buy that' be
[46:44] something quite spectacular um yeah I
[46:47] you know if they do buy Bitcoin they
[46:48] might not go all in with their treasury
[46:50] but
[46:52] um yeah I there's there's a lot of
[46:55] teasing about whether or not they're
[46:57] going to do it um you know Ryan Cohen
[46:59] he's currently following three people
[47:01] right now you one of those is um you
[47:04] know his own company GameStop he's also
[47:06] following Bitcoin magazine and I I
[47:09] forget who the third person was he just
[47:10] followed but it was also Bitcoin
[47:12] related um so there's there's a lot of
[47:14] telegraphing going on here um
[47:19] yeah you know and why wouldn't you if
[47:21] you if you've got a company and you
[47:23] you're not really sure how to grow it
[47:24] but you've got you know billions of
[47:26] dollars of cash sitting on hand is just
[47:28] melting away in treasuries or whatever
[47:29] you're holding it in you know why not
[47:32] put it in Bitcoin if you believe that
[47:33] gross story is is still going to
[47:35] continue yeah that's that's pretty cool
[47:37] he he is following GameStop Bitcoin
[47:40] magazine and Bitcoin the the Bitcoin
[47:43] handle uh so that that's kind of a small
[47:47] signal there that he saids yeah I mean
[47:50] if if he's not going to do it this is a
[47:52] big tease you know might be a big tease
[47:55] but um
[47:57] yeah I you can't look at this and say
[47:58] he's not telegraphing interest
[48:00] so also like uh when you open his
[48:03] profile it's let's literally the Michael
[48:05] sailor picture also uh right in front
[48:08] that that's that's also great to see I I
[48:10] think it would be it would be really
[48:12] interesting to see what they what
[48:13] they've talked because like why would
[48:16] Ryan meet Michael like that the they
[48:20] time is a lot uh worth so they they
[48:23] usually have some they usually have some
[48:26] idea why they meet like they they don't
[48:29] meet they could meet just to have fun
[48:31] but uh they they probably have some uh
[48:34] some thing they ex uh they they talked
[48:36] about and like what did they talk about
[48:39] like probably Bitcoin yeah I can't
[48:42] imagine they just got together to like
[48:43] go bowling or something right they gotta
[48:45] be talking about Bitcoin uh would be fun
[48:48] to to bowl with M about it's like they
[48:51] they definitely talked uh about Bitcoin
[48:54] there it's almost uh it's almost imposs
[48:56] possible and so then they're like okay
[49:00] uh B is always very strategic so maybe
[49:03] Ryan wanted to implement that and wanted
[49:05] to know like what's the best way like
[49:08] how can GameStop move forward and and be
[49:10] a Bitcoin company uh and with like the
[49:13] small signaling with like following
[49:15] people there here and there and stuff
[49:17] like that um and with meeting Michael
[49:19] saor I wouldn't surp I wouldn't be
[49:22] surprised if this year's story uh big
[49:24] Bitcoin story might even be GameStop
[49:26] like if if they they do a big move maybe
[49:30] even Beyond uh just buying Bitcoin maybe
[49:33] they do something with like uh
[49:36] developments or whatever um it that
[49:39] would be I wouldn't be surprised if
[49:40] GameStop might be a bigger story in the
[49:42] second half of this year yeah certainly
[49:44] and if they if they made a move now
[49:46] especially if they made like a hard move
[49:48] now or anytime in the next few months
[49:50] and we do get you know the big 2025
[49:53] everybody's expecting know if they turn
[49:55] that $5 billion into into 15 billion by
[49:58] the end of the year a lot of people
[50:00] would be talking about that absolutely
[50:02] what do you think is the end goal of of
[50:05] strategy B I mean end goal I don't know
[50:08] if they have end goal but what what do
[50:09] you think is the the the bigger wish
[50:11] also with the rebranding now and and and
[50:14] with their kind of Bitcoin focused
[50:18] branding sure and there's been some
[50:21] speculation um you know you know shout
[50:22] out to uh Michael Sullivan who pointed
[50:25] this out that uh it it looks like a
[50:28] bridge brand you know it looks like some
[50:30] you know micro strategy to strategy
[50:33] B and eventually that could you know
[50:35] perhaps that's that's a bridge brand
[50:37] eventually being strategy bank so um you
[50:42] know the the the convertible debt um
[50:45] forred stock just share Arbitrage
[50:49] version of Bitcoin accumulation is it's
[50:52] something it's still going to work for a
[50:53] while but it's not it's not it's not
[50:55] something that that they're going to be
[50:56] able to do forever um event at some
[50:59] point if they're a company that has you
[51:01] know the the most Bitcoin of any
[51:03] institution in the world and Bitcoin
[51:05] banking becomes a thing you know who's
[51:07] going to be best position to that who's
[51:09] going to be best position to execute on
[51:11] that well obviously them so they're
[51:14] going to have uh you know a lot of
[51:17] optionality in terms of what what they
[51:18] do with that Bitcoin um yeah it's going
[51:22] to be interesting whether or not they
[51:24] actually become something that looks
[51:25] like a a consumer bank with lending
[51:27] services and all that I don't know um
[51:30] it's definitely not where they're at now
[51:31] it's going to take a it would take years
[51:34] probably 10 or more years to get to that
[51:35] point but um I I think they're going to
[51:39] continue to show us creativity the types
[51:41] of financial engineering that they do
[51:43] and the types of products that they
[51:45] offer um you know right now the customer
[51:47] for those is primarily institutional
[51:49] investors um maybe they come up with
[51:54] some creative ways to financialized
[51:57] Bitcoin for for retail investors at some
[51:59] point um I don't know we'll see yeah Al
[52:01] they have usually like a B2B uh Focus so
[52:05] maybe they uh even get to be um a
[52:08] Bitcoin bank for for corporations or
[52:10] something like that could could happen
[52:12] like they have a lot of possibilities
[52:14] and will be fun to see the company like
[52:17] it's already fun to see if you think
[52:19] about where Michael strategy was five
[52:22] years ago and where it is now like that
[52:27] um that whole Rebirth of a company is
[52:31] pretty amazing uh because 5 years it was
[52:34] a in a completely different direction
[52:37] going where it's going now and it was
[52:39] also a completely different size uh they
[52:42] had like 500 million back in the day on
[52:45] the balance sheet I don't even know what
[52:47] they have now but like they have now how
[52:49] many Bitcoin do they have they're
[52:51] they're almost to 500,000 they're oh man
[52:54] they're about I think they're like 800
[52:55] and some shot of 500,000 probably
[52:58] probably get there by the end of the
[52:59] quarter I love that wow 500,000 that
[53:03] that that went r that went really quick
[53:06] I can remember when we talked not that
[53:09] long ago about like will they hit the 1%
[53:11] of the Bitcoin Supply yeah but you know
[53:14] just last summer people were saying um
[53:16] you know micro strategy will probably
[53:18] never own much more than 200,000 Bitcoin
[53:21] and uh yeah we we blew way past that
[53:26] yeah November just changed changed the
[53:29] game in a very big way um just with the
[53:32] amount of Bitcoin they're able to
[53:33] buy um yeah you know it's something else
[53:36] I I just thought you know different way
[53:37] I thought to frame the whole like do
[53:38] they become a bank issue is U it
[53:41] probably coincides somewhat with when
[53:42] when does Bitcoin flip from being you
[53:45] know primarily a speculative asset you
[53:47] know I'm comfortable saying right now
[53:48] it's primarily a speculative asset to
[53:51] being um you know
[53:54] primarily you know a store value Asset
[53:58] um and that's probably the inflection
[54:01] point like right now let's let's say
[54:02] what what can you how can you
[54:04] financialized Bitcoin for consumers or
[54:07] um other than like something like
[54:08] lending it and if you're going to lend
[54:11] Bitcoin for you know 5% return or
[54:14] whatever it is whoever is borrowing that
[54:16] has to have some use case for that
[54:19] Bitcoin where they think that the return
[54:22] on it is going to be greater than the
[54:23] return on bitcoin plus 5%
[54:26] and so you know there's right now
[54:29] basically what can you do with that you
[54:30] know you can short it you can trade it
[54:32] but U the road from from getting to that
[54:36] kind of activity
[54:37] to you know I want to buy a house and I
[54:40] want to borrow some Bitcoin to use it
[54:43] because Bitcoin is money now that's much
[54:45] further out in the future but that that
[54:47] kind of inflection point what that looks
[54:48] like I think that that will change what
[54:52] some of the possibilities are um but but
[54:55] in the future you know maybe maybe 10 15
[54:57] years down the road who knows maybe
[54:59] sooner if if Bitcoin really um goes a
[55:01] lot faster than we think it will
[55:03] but absolutely really interesting um I
[55:06] have one question that I ask each and
[55:08] every one of my guests and the question
[55:09] is what can we learn from you besides
[55:12] Bitcoin what can you learn for me
[55:13] besides Bitcoin um well I uh so I guess
[55:17] my one of my hobbies is language
[55:19] learning if you want tips about learning
[55:21] new languages fast I I might have some
[55:23] tips for you I I I do want to learn this
[55:25] because like my my girlfriend speaks
[55:27] Hindi uh and I mean we talk English to
[55:30] each other uh but and like it's natural
[55:34] because like she talks so much English
[55:35] and and and I also talk so much English
[55:37] it's almost and now talk actually 95% of
[55:40] my life English and only 5% German uh
[55:44] but I do want to learn uh Hindi and it's
[55:49] it's it's a it's a hard thing like how
[55:50] do you go ahead and do that do you use
[55:53] apps or like do you use YouTube videos
[55:55] or like you go and C or like you find
[55:57] someone to learn it from or you move to
[55:59] the country like what is the best way
[56:02] sure um yeah like so if you're at the
[56:05] very very very very beginning stages
[56:07] like you don't know anything yet I like
[56:09] programs like pims lure or Michelle
[56:11] Thomas I think they've got like very
[56:13] good like introductory programs that
[56:15] kind of get you up and running with the
[56:16] grammar and so basic vocabulary very
[56:19] quickly um and just kind of like this
[56:22] this magic threshold that happens once
[56:24] you're able to carry on live
[56:26] conversations and you you can kind of
[56:27] learn the language as you're talking to
[56:29] someone and you're not having to stop
[56:31] every five minutes because you don't
[56:32] know what they said um once you as
[56:35] you're kind of bridging to that point I
[56:37] like just having a language exchange
[56:38] partner you one of the I used do this a
[56:41] lot especially when I was in my college
[56:43] days is that I would just you know find
[56:47] um you know another someone who was you
[56:50] know from the country that's language I
[56:53] wanted to learn and we get together and
[56:54] we'd speak you know Japanese for an hour
[56:56] and then we speak English for an hour
[56:57] that was very productive interesting
[56:59] yeah I think I think the you have to go
[57:03] through all over that one uh barrier
[57:06] where you you at least can hold up a
[57:08] conversation a little bit yeah uh but
[57:12] that that's the that's the hard part
[57:13] like get get getting there I I know in
[57:16] English I made big progress once I made
[57:20] an English vacation where four weeks in
[57:23] a row I forced myself to only speak
[57:25] English
[57:26] uh and uh I jumped from B1 to C1
[57:31] basically within like weeks uh just
[57:34] because I forced myself to learn
[57:35] everyday English and talk only English I
[57:38] it it came to be an obsession of like I
[57:42] all of the sudden dreamed in English and
[57:45] I was uh counting in the gym in English
[57:48] and I like like my brain completely
[57:50] switched after I think like one and a
[57:52] half two weeks was the the switch really
[57:55] and and uh since then I'm I'm consuming
[57:58] everything in English and before I
[57:59] wasn't even able to speak nicely like I
[58:02] couldn't listen to people in English
[58:04] like now I have a podcast that has
[58:07] speaking English so so so now it's it's
[58:09] quite good but like
[58:12] five five six years ago around that time
[58:15] couldn't even nicely speak and I
[58:17] couldn't understand nicely English so I
[58:19] I really needed to work on that so it's
[58:21] it's definitely possible uh if if you
[58:23] going to do it and but English is one of
[58:26] English is actually uh I don't know like
[58:29] but English is not that hard I feel like
[58:32] German would be way harder and uh and
[58:34] and other languages hindia I mean
[58:37] there's a there are some some challenges
[58:39] there what do you think is the hardest
[58:40] hardest language to learn or what is the
[58:42] hardest language you learned so far yeah
[58:45] we've got two two different answers for
[58:47] that I think that you know the the
[58:48] hardest language to learn is the one
[58:49] that's is suppos different from the one
[58:51] you already
[58:52] speak so like if you look at the the
[58:54] Foreign Service Institute they've got
[58:55] these diagrams of like these charts of
[58:59] you know the basically the time the
[59:00] average time they expect it to take some
[59:03] when they're training for the foreign
[59:04] serice to learn these languages like
[59:05] Japanese and Korean are consistently R
[59:08] near the top just because you know
[59:10] there's so much different than English
[59:12] um whereas like you know when I was
[59:13] learning I was trying to learn Swedish
[59:15] and danish like it was so much easier
[59:16] just because so much of the vocabulary
[59:18] is like the same but sounds a little bit
[59:20] different but the other thing I would
[59:21] throw it out throw it at you is that
[59:24] anywhere in the world um you can find a
[59:27] four-year-old who who speaks the
[59:28] language you're interested in so
[59:30] anywhere in the world you know
[59:31] four-year-olds can learn any language in
[59:33] the world and speak it you know natively
[59:35] and fluently um
[59:37] so I think that I think the take away
[59:40] from that is if it's something you're
[59:41] really interested it's within your grasp
[59:43] any language in the world you want to
[59:45] learn yeah it's it's just about are you
[59:47] really really willing to learn it and
[59:50] how much time are you willing to to
[59:52] commit to it because you you can
[59:54] definitely do it yeah uh really cool
[59:58] uh interesting you choose that H sorry
[60:02] one more question on that how did you
[60:04] how did it come to that that you're like
[60:05] passionate about learning new languages
[60:08] um it's a good question I mean I I when
[60:11] I was in high school I I did I went I
[60:13] was a foreign exchange student in Japan
[60:14] for a semester and just something about
[60:18] learning Japanese just I I really liked
[60:20] it and then then I went to Korea One
[60:23] Summer and I started learning Korean and
[60:24] just just something about learning new
[60:27] words and grammar and finding new ways
[60:29] to express things and uh just finding
[60:32] like the exact right wording to um
[60:36] explain things it's just just something
[60:39] that I really
[60:40] enjoy you know and in every I think
[60:42] probably one of the misconceptions about
[60:44] learning languages is it's just you're
[60:46] learning all the same words but in a
[60:49] different language like it's not how it
[60:50] works you're like you're learning an
[60:51] entire new way of expressing something
[60:56] um you know from from from the bottom up
[60:58] like there are there are words that just
[60:59] don't have counterparts and I think it
[61:01] just kind of gives you this this broader
[61:03] way of of describing the world that uh
[61:06] just found very interesting and
[61:08] appealing there's even like uh studies
[61:11] around if you speak a different
[61:13] language almost your personality changes
[61:16] a little bit of like if if you are
[61:19] speaking German versus English versus
[61:22] French or like the the you you you take
[61:26] a little bit of a different personality
[61:28] on uh and uh that part is really
[61:32] interesting for me of like
[61:34] comparing me being an English speaker
[61:36] versus me being a German speaker and I
[61:39] and I noticed some small differences uh
[61:42] but at that point it's it's really hard
[61:43] because I switch so naturally between
[61:45] those two now uh but in the beginning it
[61:47] was definitely noticeable do you also
[61:49] notice something where you like you you
[61:52] change how you say something like almost
[61:54] like a character change when when when
[61:56] you have a different language yeah yeah
[61:58] I've definitely noticed that
[62:01] um it might stand out even even more
[62:04] sharply to me because you know I
[62:05] actually lived in Korea for 10 years and
[62:08] um and then when I came back it was like
[62:09] major reverse culture shock and
[62:13] uh and
[62:15] um yeah it's it's I always think about
[62:19] how you try to describe something like
[62:20] that to someone who who hasn't been
[62:22] through it and um it's hard to do I
[62:25] don't to say about it but but yeah it's
[62:27] it's absolutely a thing where you get
[62:29] these little personality tweaks when you
[62:31] switch into another language and like I
[62:33] could definitely tell that I'm a little
[62:34] bit different when I'm speaking to
[62:35] someone in Japanese versus Korean versus
[62:37] English and uh it's definitely a real
[62:39] thing absolutely really cool uh we have
[62:42] end in the podcast where the previous
[62:44] guest is asking a question for the next
[62:46] guest without knowing who the next guest
[62:47] actually is and uh the previous guest
[62:50] asked you the question who is the most
[62:53] surprising person you have orange build
[62:56] so far most surprising person that I
[62:58] have orange builded um question um I I I
[63:04] recently got my father to take a small
[63:07] micro strategy
[63:10] position um and just because he's not a
[63:14] very techsavvy person um so just just
[63:18] the idea of having anything to do with
[63:20] with with Bitcoin is something that is
[63:21] just kind of very alien to his way of
[63:23] being so but just
[63:26] you know talking to him about it he said
[63:28] you know you might might want to check
[63:29] this out a little bit and just you know
[63:30] me being the son
[63:33] obviously uh trust me to give it a try
[63:37] so know he's got M his position and uh
[63:40] if we uh if things go well then
[63:42] everybody will be
[63:44] happy absolutely really cool thank you
[63:46] so much Brian for for for being on um
[63:49] before I let you go where can people
[63:51] find you ask you questions and and reach
[63:52] out to you sure so I am a bit Co
[63:56] overflow on Twitter it's
[63:58] BTC
[64:00] overflow
[64:03] um and the underscore is important the
[64:05] BTC overflow with that underscore
[64:07] account is impersonator but um yeah so
[64:10] if you want to learn more about me talk
[64:11] to me uh that's where I am and so like
[64:15] usually the the impersonator is using
[64:17] the
[64:17] underscore now the real person uses the
[64:20] underscore and the impersonator has
[64:22] without underscore yeah well it tell you
[64:25] there there's story behind that um I I
[64:28] almost did it with thecore but every
[64:30] time I looked at it it looked like bet
[64:32] coverflow it's like that's just not
[64:34] right I had to put in underscore there
[64:36] so it really looked like BTC overflow oh
[64:39] okay yeah like it makes sense yeah
[64:42] interesting yeah but but but like it's
[64:47] there are a lot of
[64:48] impersonators in copers in there that
[64:50] that try to scan people yeah really cool
[64:52] um thank you so much for for being on
[64:54] also thank you so much for everyone that
[64:56] is watching and listening for for
[64:57] joining us today as always I'll be back
[65:00] tomorrow for another episode bye-bye
