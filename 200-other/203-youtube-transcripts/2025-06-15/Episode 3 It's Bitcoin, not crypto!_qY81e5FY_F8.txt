[00:00] what you don't understand that Bitcoin
[00:02] is the only crypto that's actually
[00:04] decentralized that's why we are saying
[00:06] Bitcoin not
[00:07] [Music]
[00:14] crypto the top five tweets of this week
[00:18] let's go the first one is from Bitcoin
[00:21] for Freedom which level I on level one
[00:24] Bitcoin is a
[00:26] cryptocurrency basically I think the
[00:28] first level is like you are interested
[00:31] in cryptocurrencies if you are
[00:32] interested in like um so like there
[00:35] before the first level there's always
[00:37] the crypto denier there's the person
[00:39] that says crypto is nothing for me I
[00:41] don't want to deal with Bitcoin
[00:43] cryptocurrencies at all I'm just a
[00:46] skeptic about the whole industry and
[00:49] this is level zero when you want to say
[00:51] it like that but level one would be I'm
[00:55] interested in cryptocurrencies and
[00:57] that's what Bitcoin for freedom I think
[01:00] wants to save with level one Bitcoin is
[01:02] a cryptocurrency I'm interested in it
[01:05] Bitcoin is gambling for me those levels
[01:07] are mixed for me Bitcoin is gambling is
[01:11] level one maybe level zero is I don't
[01:14] like it then it's a gamble then it's a
[01:16] cryptocurrency then you are interested
[01:18] in and level three I'm too late to
[01:20] bitcoin I hear that all the time even
[01:22] from people that are into cryptos but
[01:25] not into Bitcoin they're like oh because
[01:28] cryptos or like a smaller coin is maybe
[01:32] $1 or $2 or maybe 10 or $100 but not
[01:37] $26,000 this number is so big for them
[01:40] and they don't understand market
[01:42] capitalization so they think Bitcoin is
[01:44] just too expensive I'm too late to
[01:46] bitcoin they have no clue about market
[01:49] capitalization they have no clue about
[01:51] adoption they have no clue about the
[01:53] fundamentals of sound money and that's
[01:56] why they are saying I'm late to bitcoin
[01:59] level four I really like level four I
[02:01] hold Bitcoin ethereum and ripple this
[02:04] level means you understood that
[02:07] decentralization is good on this level
[02:09] you understood that decentralization is
[02:11] a good thing and so you're like I'm
[02:13] investing in cryptocurrencies what you
[02:15] don't understand that Bitcoin is the
[02:18] only crypto that's actually
[02:20] decentralized that's why we are saying
[02:21] Bitcoin not crypto because Bitcoin is
[02:23] the only option we actually have so
[02:26] don't get distracted by some [ __ ]
[02:28] coin I mean level five level six is uh
[02:31] somewhat similar level five is like I
[02:34] only hold Bitcoin and then from only
[02:37] holding Bitcoin to bitcoin is fixing the
[02:39] world it's most likely the same level
[02:42] sometimes people are switching to
[02:44] bitcoin only and then discovering oh
[02:46] Bitcoin is actually fixing all the
[02:48] problems but for me that's the same
[02:49] level number two breaking UK prime
[02:52] minister live on BBC inflation is a tax
[02:57] it's a tax that impacts the poorest
[02:59] people the most let's hear what he has
[03:01] to say also want to cut taxes the best
[03:03] tax cut that I can deliver for the
[03:05] British people right now is to Harve
[03:06] inflation that was was the first of my
[03:08] prior the
[03:12] I
[03:14] actually really important you just said
[03:16] something that I completely disagree
[03:17] with inflation is a tax you just said it
[03:20] isn't inflation is a tax it's a tax that
[03:22] impact the poorest people the most and
[03:25] that is why the best tax cut that I can
[03:27] deliver is to Har inflation and why I
[03:30] set it out as the first economically
[03:33] economically the impact that it has on
[03:35] people is to eat into their pockets into
[03:38] their wallets it puts up the prices of
[03:40] things it effectively acts as a tax and
[03:42] that is why we must bring it down and
[03:44] that's why we are and the plans are
[03:45] working 100% inflation is a tax and the
[03:49] best tax cut every politician could make
[03:52] working towards a Bitcoin standard there
[03:55] is no inflation with Bitcoin it's a hard
[03:57] cap asset the Prime Minister I don't
[03:59] think he understands Bitcoin maybe he's
[04:02] not allowed to speak out loud about it
[04:03] but at least it's refreshing to see a
[04:06] politician talk about inflation is a tax
[04:08] and we need to cut inflation number
[04:11] three is from the Bitcoin therapist big
[04:13] money is coming to bitcoin Goldman saxs
[04:16] Morgan Stanley Black Rock Fidelity JP
[04:19] Morgan all are coming into Bitcoin and
[04:22] even an Black Rock director said in the
[04:25] next 3 to 6 months all the Bitcoin ETFs
[04:28] will be approved they manage a [ __ ] ton
[04:31] of money it's tremendous how much assets
[04:34] are under control under those big
[04:37] institutions so it will be really really
[04:39] big if they come in and actually trying
[04:41] to get institutional investors investing
[04:45] their money into Bitcoin via them of
[04:47] course don't
[04:49] invest your hard-earned financial energy
[04:51] into a Bitcoin ETF just buy Bitcoin
[04:54] directly but there are some
[04:55] institutional investors that they won't
[04:58] buy Bitcoin directly they will buy only
[05:00] with the big institutional asset
[05:02] managers like Black Rock morg Stanley JP
[05:05] Morgan so make sure to stack enough sets
[05:08] before the big money is really coming in
[05:10] number four the Bitcoin AR Justin
[05:12] customer furious at aric Banks refusing
[05:16] to let them withdraw their US dollar
[05:18] deposits we saw this in Lebanon before
[05:20] the currency collapsed plus 90% buy
[05:24] Bitcoin before you need it we see this
[05:26] all the time banks are not letting their
[05:28] customers withraw their money sometimes
[05:31] they don't let them withdraw at all
[05:34] sometimes they put like a hard limit
[05:36] like1 a day500 a day or something like
[05:39] that but it shows to the world it shows
[05:42] to everybody who pays attention that the
[05:44] money in the bank account is not your
[05:46] money it's the bank's money you just
[05:48] have the right to withdraw it if they
[05:49] stop your right to withdraw the money
[05:51] you don't own it at all so better get
[05:53] some Bitcoin and better get your Bitcoin
[05:56] off exchange and better learn how to
[05:58] manage your keys effec effectively
[06:00] number five is from Ronin Ronin says
[06:03] this is all man want and we have four
[06:06] pictures first picture wife with kid
[06:08] second picture is a cold card and third
[06:12] picture is Jim and fourth picture is
[06:15] meat so basically not all men want
[06:17] eating meat there's a lot of debates
[06:20] going on in the Bitcoin Community
[06:21] carnivore versus wean but in essence
[06:24] this is really true bitcoiners are
[06:26] simple they want to found a family they
[06:28] want to hold their own Financial energy
[06:30] they want to be strong and independent
[06:32] financially but also physically and they
[06:35] want to eat healthy that's what all the
[06:37] bitcoiners want and with that thanks for
[06:39] watching I see you in the next one
[06:43] [Music]
[06:49] bye-bye
