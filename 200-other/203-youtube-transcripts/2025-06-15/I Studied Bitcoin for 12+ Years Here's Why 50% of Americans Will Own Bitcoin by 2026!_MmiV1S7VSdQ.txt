[00:00] the leader of the free world saying
[00:01] Bitcoin's here to stay. I'm your Bitcoin
[00:04] president, right? We're going to make
[00:05] America the Bitcoin capital of the
[00:06] world. I want all the remaining Bitcoin
[00:08] mined in America. Is he's trying to
[00:10] acquire 1 million Bitcoin. Big picture,
[00:12] I think we're headed towards a mini
[00:14] recession right now in the United
[00:15] States. I think that that's what Trump's
[00:17] planning for. They were going to go into
[00:18] a short-term recession for maybe 6 to 12
[00:21] months. But seeing what Trump's doing,
[00:23] and from what I hear from other people,
[00:24] Trump's strategy is to be the first in,
[00:26] first out. So, you're watching gold
[00:28] leaving other countries and being
[00:30] shipped into the United States in like
[00:32] some weird in like the middle of the
[00:34] night on flights uh some odd I don't
[00:36] know however many tons of gold just
[00:37] vanished from Argentina. Theoretically,
[00:40] by buying Bitcoin, Black Rockck has
[00:41] saved every renter in America roughly
[00:44] $100 to $200 a month off their rent
[00:47] payments. You know, that's what
[00:48] Buchelli's done to that country. And how
[00:50] did he do it? Fixed the money. This is
[00:52] their first year, I think, that they're
[00:53] going to have a a surplus budget. So,
[00:55] he's balanced his budget. He's
[00:57] eradicated the corruption from politics.
[00:59] And he cut off foreign money from
[01:01] influencing his country. And it's it's
[01:04] that simple.
[01:06] [Music]
[01:09] Hi, Ryan. Thank you so much for being on
[01:11] the show again. Robin, brother, it's an
[01:13] honor to be here, man. I'm actually
[01:14] stoked, so stoked to be here. It It's
[01:17] really really cool to have you back on
[01:19] the show. And uh since we last recorded
[01:22] so much has happened when we think about
[01:24] the Trump election, the strategic
[01:26] Bitcoin reserve and all the little
[01:28] things in between uh that happened in
[01:30] the last year basically. How how do you
[01:32] look back at uh what happened
[01:34] politically but also in general with
[01:36] Bitcoin. And what a wild ride it's been,
[01:38] hasn't it, man? Since the last time we
[01:40] talked, I forget where Bitcoin was last
[01:42] time we talked, but
[01:43] maybe 40, 50, 60 somewhere around there.
[01:47] Definitely a lot less than now. Yeah.
[01:50] And we rode all the way up like 110 and
[01:52] it's sitting at uh what is it sitting at
[01:53] right now? Like 87. I just saw it shot
[01:55] up a little bit ago. So, man, it's like
[01:59] you know how it is. It's just Bitcoin.
[02:00] You never know where it's going to go,
[02:02] but you're always so stoked when it's
[02:04] going up, man. And I'm uh you know, I
[02:06] think that you know, we we're
[02:08] Bitcoiners, right? So, we're all just
[02:09] humbly waiting for, you know, price to
[02:12] go up. We know it only it's only going
[02:13] in one direction and it only stays down
[02:15] for so long, man. So, I'm super happy
[02:17] with where Bitcoin's at right now. I did
[02:19] think that uh you know based off of the
[02:22] h havingings, this was the first cycle
[02:23] that we put in a new all-time high prior
[02:26] to a havinging where normally you have
[02:28] this political cycle where Bitcoin bull
[02:32] runs and maybe this is just Satoshi's
[02:34] genius to time them the creation of
[02:36] Bitcoin or the or the timing of a having
[02:38] to a political cycle. So literally in
[02:41] the year leading up to an election in
[02:43] the United States, every single having
[02:46] you have this political cycle. So you're
[02:48] always in uh an environment where the
[02:52] leader of the free world is doing
[02:55] everything humanly possible to make the
[02:57] am the economy as strong and the stock
[03:00] market as powerful as possible by
[03:02] injecting liquidity doing what they do
[03:05] which then drives the price of Bitcoin
[03:06] up. So because of this kind of political
[03:09] landscape being so just bizarre and not
[03:13] normal, uh I think that's why we haven't
[03:15] seen Bitcoin, you know, go off on this
[03:18] complete riper in a bull run like we're
[03:19] normally seeing like this timing after a
[03:21] having. But I
[03:23] think big picture, I think we're headed
[03:25] towards a mini recession right now in
[03:27] the United States. I think that that's
[03:29] what Trump's planning for. I think we're
[03:30] going to go into a short-term recession
[03:32] for maybe 6 to 12 months. But seeing
[03:34] what Trump's doing and from what I hear
[03:36] from other people, Trump's strategy is
[03:38] to be the first in, first out. So
[03:40] Trump's knows that there's so much
[03:41] builtup liquidity in these markets and
[03:43] so much there's so much brokenness
[03:45] inside of our markets that Trump's
[03:48] trying to basically force us into this
[03:50] depression or recession, if you will,
[03:52] let all of that built up animosity and
[03:55] all the crap companies just, you know,
[03:57] work their way out and then in comes all
[03:59] this money and capital. It's already
[04:01] coming in. You're already seeing Trump
[04:03] Trump sign 500 million billion dollar
[04:05] deals, $600 billion deals. I think he's
[04:07] got a trillion dollar deal that he's
[04:08] working on. All these trade agreements,
[04:10] all these companies and corporations
[04:11] bringing uh technology and companies
[04:14] back to America. But that's going to
[04:15] take 12 to, you know, 18 months for
[04:18] those jobs to really start paying off to
[04:20] the new hires, for people to have being
[04:22] able to get themselves out of the debt
[04:23] they're in, have that extra capital, and
[04:25] start spending it back into the economy
[04:27] again. So, that's kind of where I think
[04:29] we're headed. H how important do you
[04:31] think was was Trump's election
[04:33] especially as also when you look at
[04:35] Bitcoin? So
[04:37] man I think it was the most important I
[04:41] think it was the most important election
[04:42] in all of history in all of
[04:44] humanity. If Trump were to have lost
[04:46] that election if they would have been
[04:48] able to rig it like they were trying to
[04:50] I don't think America would be standing
[04:52] in in 4 years. At the very least it
[04:55] would it would not be recognizable. it
[04:58] would be some type of dystopian police
[05:00] communist police state. And then you
[05:02] already see how much the rest of the
[05:05] world takes their orders, at least the
[05:07] western world kind of takes their their
[05:09] their orders from the United States.
[05:10] When the United States is doing
[05:12] something, they're kind of all doing it
[05:13] and following suit. And you could see
[05:15] that without the USA being the good guy
[05:18] and kind of the leader, you're seeing
[05:19] all the like these these civilizations
[05:22] just collapsing. You're watching it in
[05:23] France, you're watching in Germany,
[05:24] you're watching it in the UK. I mean,
[05:26] these these nations were some once the
[05:28] the greatest nations in the world, and
[05:30] now they're they're just shadows of
[05:33] their former self. So, I think Trump at
[05:35] the very least for the short term saved
[05:38] America. I think as far as for Bitcoin,
[05:41] if Trump wasn't elected, I don't think
[05:45] it would have mattered that much. As far
[05:47] big picture, long-term short-term
[05:50] absolutely was important for Bitcoin and
[05:52] it kind of sets the bar for the rest of
[05:53] the world. If America is going to make
[05:56] Bitcoin a Treasury Reserve asset, the
[05:58] second that they actually start
[06:00] acquiring that Bitcoin and printing or
[06:03] at the very least take taking the profit
[06:05] that the Fed makes every year and taking
[06:07] that profit and using that profit to buy
[06:09] additional Bitcoin. Uh that's when I
[06:11] think we're going to really start to see
[06:12] things. You're going to start to see,
[06:13] you know, I think Sailor does it says it
[06:16] last like loser print last, right? It's
[06:18] like once the United States government
[06:19] and the Fed starts printing, it's like,
[06:21] okay, whoever the last Federal Reserve
[06:24] is to fire up that printing press to buy
[06:26] Bitcoin loses, right, in in theory. So,
[06:28] I think it it it really leveled that
[06:31] playing field as far as
[06:33] uh just solidifying Bitcoin as it as
[06:37] it's not going anywhere, right? You now
[06:38] have the president of the free the
[06:40] leader of the free world saying,
[06:42] "Bitcoin's here to stay. I'm your
[06:44] Bitcoin president, right? We're going to
[06:46] make America the Bitcoin capital of the
[06:47] world. I want all the remaining Bitcoin
[06:49] mined in America. I want to acquire. His
[06:52] goal based off of what his advisers are
[06:54] saying is he's trying to acquire 1
[06:58] million
[06:59] Bitcoin. 1 million Bitcoin. That's going
[07:01] to be no small feat. And they're they're
[07:03] talking about right now
[07:05] remonetizing the the the gold and then
[07:09] taking all of the extra value because we
[07:11] have our gold in our vault valued at $42
[07:14] an ounce, right? Not $3,100 or whatever
[07:17] it is. So Trump wants to have them
[07:20] re-evaluate the the value of our gold
[07:22] holdings and change it. Like our
[07:23] certificates say something about gold on
[07:27] them. Oh, no. They're the gold
[07:29] certificates that that are uh the gold
[07:31] certificates basically state on them
[07:33] that that gold's at $42 an ounce or $37
[07:36] an ounce or whatever it is. So when it
[07:38] revalues at $3,000 and say we have 42
[07:40] metric tonses or whatever that's going
[07:42] to give Trump the buying capital of like
[07:44] I forget what it is like some odd
[07:46] trillions of dollars or billions of
[07:47] dollars worth of purchasing power that
[07:50] he's going to that they're going to use
[07:51] to purchase Bitcoin. What what do you
[07:52] think thought about uh this and I
[07:55] actually don't know the current status
[07:56] of that. I just know it was a Twitter
[07:58] thing and uh with Mount Gaus and if the
[08:01] goal is actually there and I think Elon
[08:03] Musk was was like oh didn't someone
[08:05] check it last year and he actually
[08:08] learned that nobody checked it. What
[08:10] what's going on with that? Did did you
[08:12] follow that story?
[08:14] So you're watching
[08:15] gold leaving other
[08:18] countries and being shipped into the
[08:20] United States in like some weird in like
[08:22] the middle of the night on flights some
[08:24] odd I don't know however many tons of
[08:26] gold just vanished from
[08:28] Argentina which is really weird what's
[08:30] going on in Argentina right now. So it's
[08:32] like why is why are all these
[08:34] countries basically packing up their
[08:36] gold and shipping it to random
[08:38] locations, right? We think at least in
[08:40] America, we think that that maybe that
[08:42] all that gold wasn't there in the
[08:43] Federal Reserve. So now that our Fed is
[08:46] trying to basically borrow gold just so
[08:48] that when Trump and Elon go in and
[08:50] actually audit, there's gold there. So
[08:53] it'll be pretty interesting to see.
[08:56] They've been talking about auditing the
[08:57] Fed since I was born. Every year there's
[09:00] a politician or somebody or a senator,
[09:02] whether it's Rand Paul, Trump now, Elon,
[09:05] talking about going in and auditing the
[09:07] Fed, and nobody's ever done it. Nobody's
[09:08] actually ever went in and seen that
[09:11] physical gold. So, do I think Trump's
[09:12] gonna actually do it? I don't know. A
[09:13] lot of what he does, I think, is just
[09:15] for talk and show. Maybe. We'll see.
[09:18] They they have to go in there with a
[09:19] live stream and uh like bring a hammer
[09:22] and then clam on the goalie and see if
[09:24] it's actually true. Uh I mean, I I I
[09:29] don't know like what's what's going on,
[09:30] but if someone does it, then Elen does
[09:32] it. Elon should go in there with a with
[09:35] a gold cutting chainsaw and just
[09:37] chainsaw one of the bricks in half just
[09:38] live on TV, right? Just to make the
[09:40] liberals cry. That that would be one one
[09:44] heck of a TV thing. Uh it's it's super
[09:46] interesting the current landscape, how
[09:49] governments have to cut down on their
[09:51] spending, uh how Bitcoin comes up and
[09:54] and and and how we are seeing that
[09:57] nation state game theory actually play
[09:59] out in in in real time. It's it's kind
[10:02] of unbelievable for me to to see that
[10:05] actually unfold. If you just think about
[10:07] two years ago or three years ago where
[10:09] Bitcoin was and where we were in in an
[10:11] adoption cycle. Um if you have talk uh
[10:15] told me oh the uh United States
[10:17] president will talk about Bitcoin and he
[10:19] will go to a Bitcoin conference like let
[10:21] just that he was at a Bitcoin conference
[10:23] and the at the New York Pop Key and
[10:26] stuff like that. It's just unbelievable
[10:28] for me that we are in that area of the
[10:30] world man. Rob and I mean I I remember
[10:33] building mining computers in
[10:35] 2015 and when there weren't the sellers
[10:38] there weren't the well there might have
[10:40] been a breed love out there somewhere
[10:41] but I don't know if he was the breed
[10:43] love that we know today right like there
[10:44] was a few people out there that were but
[10:47] but not like the sellers right it was
[10:48] like oh you want to learn about Bitcoin
[10:50] it was you were watching one of these
[10:51] documentaries um you know I remember
[10:53] building my first mining computers and I
[10:55] was setting up uh you know you got you
[10:57] got to got to go to the pools right so I
[10:59] was in a pool called dwarf pool at this
[11:01] time and I built one mining computer and
[11:04] I was mining like three coins of
[11:06] Ethereum a day and then I built a second
[11:08] one and by the time I built the second
[11:09] one um the algorithm got difficult,
[11:12] right? So I didn't understand and I was
[11:14] a shitcoiner back then. I didn't know
[11:16] what Bitcoin was, right? So I saw a
[11:18] Bitcoin miner and the person that was
[11:20] telling me about his Bitcoin miner was
[11:21] like, "Oh, you got to mine this thing
[11:22] called Ethereum." And I was like, "Oh,
[11:23] okay." And I built just built a mining,
[11:25] you know? I didn't know what the
[11:26] difference of any of them was. So, but
[11:27] where I'm going with this is I was uh I
[11:30] by the time my second computer got
[11:32] built, I was my first one was mining
[11:33] three and a half coins. I got my by the
[11:35] time I got my second one built was maybe
[11:37] like 3 weeks later. And I get it up and
[11:39] running and now all of a sudden with two
[11:41] computers running, I'm I'm mining like
[11:44] six coins or 5.5 coins, right? And like
[11:48] I didn't understand that it got
[11:50] difficult. I kept thinking that I, you
[11:54] know, had my graphics card set up wrong.
[11:56] I did I wasn't connecting to the pool,
[11:58] right? And there weren't tons of
[11:59] tutorials out there and people to teach
[12:01] you. So like that's how like so to go
[12:03] from that where I'm mining Ethereum at
[12:05] $2 and I think at the time Bitcoin the
[12:08] first coin of Ethereum I mined was
[12:10] $264 and I think Bitcoin around the time
[12:12] was either$ 250 or 500. I think it was
[12:15] closer to 500 if I'm not mistaken.
[12:18] So like I was watching guys on YouTube
[12:22] trade Bitcoin
[12:25] that it there was there was such low
[12:28] liquidity, right? When this person had
[12:29] to this person when he first started it
[12:31] was live trading, right? He was doing so
[12:34] good that he started to build this
[12:35] massive following. Then at one point it
[12:37] got to the point where he had to stop
[12:38] live trading because when he would find
[12:40] a a trade to take, so many people were
[12:42] front running his trade live that he was
[12:45] like, you know, basically losing his
[12:47] trade. So, he had to set his his stream
[12:48] on like a 30-cond or a 60-second delay
[12:51] just so he could get his trades off
[12:53] before everybody else. But, it was
[12:54] pretty uh there was just such low
[12:56] liquidity in the market, you know, a
[12:58] thousand or 2,000 people watching a live
[12:59] stream and they all went in to buy
[13:00] something at the same time. Like, you
[13:02] could you could you could move markets
[13:04] with just the live stream. And now we
[13:06] have Black Rockck owning 5 like 74,000
[13:11] Bitcoin. So, like it's like my mind is
[13:14] just blown, man. I couldn't be more
[13:16] excited.
[13:17] Black Rock is an interesting one because
[13:21] it was up until the Bitcoin ETF a very
[13:24] big opponent, an enemy uh picture of
[13:29] Bitcoiners and it still is like
[13:32] Bitcoiners are still very opposed to to
[13:35] Black Rockck depending on on who you're
[13:37] speaking to. Um but it definitely made
[13:40] the picture of Black Rockck better in
[13:42] the in the Bitcoin community. How do you
[13:44] look at uh Black Rockck and the
[13:46] importance of them buying? I usually
[13:49] argue that Black Rockck buying might
[13:51] even be more important than America
[13:53] buying.
[13:54] You know, that's uh that's a great
[13:56] question. I absolutely despise Black
[13:59] Rockck as a company as far as just them,
[14:02] right? I think Larry Frink's evil. I
[14:03] think Black Rockck's evil. I think um
[14:05] that every I think giving one company
[14:08] the ability to go into your 401k
[14:10] account, take all of the money from your
[14:12] 401k, use your money to go buy the
[14:15] assets for you, but then those assets
[14:17] are in their control. So then you're
[14:19] you're in theory giving them the ability
[14:21] to buy their way onto the seat of onto
[14:23] the board of directors of all of these
[14:25] companies, right? Because when you're
[14:26] the largest shareholder, uh the top
[14:28] eight shareholders of any company in
[14:30] America, get a seat on the board of
[14:32] directors and then the board of
[14:33] directors picks the CEO or picks the the
[14:36] managers. The managers write the
[14:38] policies. The policies, for example,
[14:40] being like in 2020, if you talked about
[14:42] the 2020 election being stolen on
[14:44] YouTube, they would strike your channel
[14:45] and take you down. Those orders came
[14:49] from the board of directors that was
[14:50] picked by companies like Black Rockck,
[14:52] Vanguard, State Street, right? So,
[14:55] giving Black Rockck all that control and
[14:56] all of this money and now you give them
[14:58] all of this Bitcoin money, which they
[15:00] have, I think it's $48 billion worth of
[15:03] Bitcoin is what their
[15:05] $578,000 Bitcoin is worth last night
[15:07] when I checked, give or take. That was
[15:09] at an $84,000 Bitcoin. So, it's probably
[15:11] up a little bit. Let's just say it's 50
[15:12] 50 billion right now. Let's flip that on
[15:15] its head.
[15:17] So what is what is Black Rockck's main
[15:21] investment for their for their
[15:23] customers? Real estate single family
[15:26] homes in America. Black Rockck owns like
[15:27] 30% of them or something crazy like
[15:29] that. So what we've seen since the
[15:31] creation of that Bitcoin ETF, what was
[15:33] that about a year ago now? Maybe give or
[15:34] take a little bit longer. So in a year,
[15:36] Bitcoin has acquired 50 or Black Rockck
[15:39] has required $50 billion worth of
[15:42] Bitcoin. Why is that a good thing? Well,
[15:45] because that $50 billion would have most
[15:47] likely went into acquiring single family
[15:49] homes in America. That 50 billion into
[15:52] single family homes in America would
[15:54] have driven up the price of rent on
[15:56] every single person's home in America
[15:58] probably by a hundred, maybe even a
[16:00] couple hundred a month. So, in theory,
[16:02] theoretically, by buying Bitcoin, Black
[16:05] Rockck has saved every renter in America
[16:07] roughly $100 to $200 a month off their
[16:10] rent payments. If my numbers are even
[16:13] remotely close, even if they're 50% of
[16:15] that, it's still a substantial amount of
[16:18] money. It's still maybe a week's worth
[16:20] of groceries for your family, a tank of
[16:22] gas over a year-long period. That adds
[16:24] up to be a lot, right? So, you know, as
[16:27] far as it's almost like
[16:29] forcing I guess I never thought about it
[16:31] like this, but like Bitcoin forces evil
[16:35] companies to do good, right? And by
[16:38] Bitcoin, when Black Rockck acquires
[16:40] 50,000 Bitcoin or 50 billion Bitcoin or
[16:43] however many, sorry, 50 billion worth of
[16:45] Bitcoin, who wins? Every single person
[16:48] that's holding Bitcoin. Who who wins?
[16:51] Every single person that's not holding
[16:53] Bitcoin, right? like the the world wins.
[16:56] So like Bitcoin forces evil companies to
[17:00] be to do some good at least maybe for
[17:03] the short term. But that's kind of my
[17:06] take on Black Rockck. And I love the
[17:09] aspect of when I hold Bitcoin, Black
[17:13] Rockck, Michael Sailor, and all of the
[17:17] other ones that hold Bitcoin are working
[17:19] for me or with me on the on the same
[17:21] thing. If they are more uh profitable,
[17:24] they will buy more Bitcoin eventually,
[17:27] which brings the value back uh in into
[17:29] Bitcoin, which kind of connects the
[17:31] whole globe on the monetary standard.
[17:34] And this makes no difference for you if
[17:39] everyone already does that. It still
[17:41] makes us a little bit difference, but it
[17:43] makes a huge difference if you're early
[17:46] to Bitcoin as as you are, as we are, as
[17:49] everyone is that will join Bitcoin in
[17:51] 2026. We have now 205, but even like
[17:54] next year if there's not someone new
[17:56] coming, they're still uh very early to
[17:59] the game. Um because we can catch the
[18:03] 97% adoption uh till Bitcoin is actually
[18:06] hit the the full saturation point. Uh
[18:10] and and it's it's kind of amazing to
[18:12] think because I think the the massive
[18:14] amount of adoption, the massive amount
[18:16] of wealth is coming after we hit 10 20
[18:21] 30% of of the uh adoption and not now
[18:25] like now it's it's
[18:26] it's kid numbers. It's like very early
[18:30] and like we we're excited about small
[18:31] things. I look at a little bit that way
[18:35] how see how people were excited when
[18:37] Bitcoin hit a dollar or 10 $10. Now we
[18:40] look back it's like who cares if it was
[18:43] a dollar or $100. It it didn't matter.
[18:46] You got a lot of Bitcoin for not a lot
[18:48] of money. The same way people will look
[18:50] back in like 10 years like who cares if
[18:52] Bitcoin was at $10,000 or at like half a
[18:55] million. It was extremely cheap.
[19:00] Dude, that's the best way to look at it,
[19:01] man. That is absolutely You are spot on.
[19:04] Dead on the money on that one, my
[19:05] friend.
[19:07] Dead on the stats. Dead on the stats. Um
[19:10] really interesting. You're doing um uh a
[19:13] lot of interesting things uh even
[19:15] outside of uh of Bitcoin. Maybe give us
[19:17] some some some kind of like update what
[19:19] what you've been up to the the last
[19:22] year. Uh you done a documentary, Unl
[19:24] Salvador, and it's all also connected
[19:26] with with Bitcoin. I I probably uh I
[19:30] will see you in in Vegas uh as soon at
[19:33] that conference also. So So uh give us
[19:35] an overview of what's what's going on.
[19:38] Yeah. So I for your audience if you guys
[19:40] don't know me, my name is Ryan Mata. I'm
[19:41] a documentary filmmaker. I specialize in
[19:44] government funded child trafficking. So
[19:46] these are the most vulnerable children
[19:48] in the world, specifically these migrant
[19:50] children that have been trafficked from
[19:51] all over the world. Uh I released a
[19:53] couple documentaries when one my last
[19:55] one was called Operation Amber Alert.
[19:57] Um, and it's uh over on my ex page at
[20:00] Ryan Matamedia in my highlights and also
[20:02] my second one is pinned at the top of my
[20:04] profile if anybody's interested in
[20:05] seeing it. So you guys can see the work
[20:06] that we're talking about here. Now in
[20:09] that uh the the first documentary I put
[20:12] out in no or the operation Amber Alert
[20:14] when I put out in November ended up u
[20:16] having it train or right before that I
[20:19] was actually in Al Salvador for the
[20:20] first time with Eric Vstacks and I was
[20:22] working on this Bitcoin documentary when
[20:25] I was at a um at a party or at an after
[20:28] event down there. Uh I was kind of
[20:31] having this conversation like we're
[20:32] having today and I was talking to one of
[20:34] these girls. She asked me what I do. I
[20:35] told her and she goes, "Uh, oh my gosh,
[20:38] you got to meet my friend Bob. He runs
[20:39] this rescue orphanage here in El
[20:42] Salvador and um he saves pregnant
[20:45] teenage girls that have been raped and
[20:47] they get pregnant and um he rescues them
[20:50] and not just rescues them and takes them
[20:52] in, he raises them like his they're his
[20:54] own daughters." And I was just like,
[20:55] "Oh, wow." Like, what are the odds? I'm
[20:57] here filming a Bitcoin documentary. I'm
[20:59] at some random place that I wasn't even
[21:01] going to go to. It was raining. like it
[21:03] took just by the grace of God, I
[21:05] randomly ended up at this event and then
[21:08] so I agreed to this and the next day and
[21:10] I don't even know anything about him. I
[21:12] didn't research him. I was just at this
[21:13] party. She said, "Yeah, you can do
[21:14] this." And I was like, "Cool. I got time
[21:15] tomorrow. Might as well." I didn't have
[21:16] anything else going on. I was in El
[21:17] Salvador for a couple weeks. I was like,
[21:18] "Yeah, let's do it." So, I had no idea
[21:21] what I was getting myself into. Now,
[21:23] I've been doing this for uh three years.
[21:26] Eric, I'm Eric Robin. And I've never
[21:29] once found anybody that I could tell
[21:33] you, yes, if you want to donate money to
[21:35] help save children, this is a place to
[21:37] do it because every one of these places
[21:39] that I've been to, they're the enemy.
[21:41] They're the ones who's actually aiding
[21:42] and abetting our government in helping
[21:44] them traffic and move these children.
[21:46] Whether willingly or just just ignorance
[21:49] and plausible deniability, they still
[21:51] should know and should have known and
[21:53] should have prevented it from happening,
[21:54] but they weren't. So, I've been just in
[21:56] search and I walk into this place. Now,
[21:59] when you walk into a place where there's
[22:00] children that have been victims of these
[22:02] type of crimes, right? They're they're
[22:04] really timid. Their heads down. They're,
[22:06] you know, they're, you know, they're
[22:08] scared. They're timid. They don't like
[22:09] they're just very standoffish. You can
[22:11] tell something's not right in those
[22:12] environments. You don't know what it is.
[22:14] And those organizations, they don't let
[22:15] you get close enough to talk to the
[22:16] kids, right? And those kids are just
[22:18] heads down and they catch a glance out
[22:20] of their eye. And then as soon as
[22:21] they're out of their eye, they're
[22:22] looking over at wherever their their b
[22:25] the the manager of the facility is, like
[22:27] to see if they're being watched, you
[22:28] know, like they're something's not
[22:30] right. I walk into this place where Bob
[22:32] that Bob has in El Salvador and I could
[22:35] instantly feel the love in this
[22:36] organization. I could tell that the
[22:38] girls were safe. They were smiling. They
[22:40] were laughing. They were carrying their
[22:41] kids. And I could just feel the love.
[22:44] And I sat down, I interviewed Bob. And
[22:45] then I got to interview Buchelli's
[22:47] auntie. So this is Buchelli's godmother
[22:50] who obviously helped Bob kind of you
[22:52] know put this whole thing together and
[22:53] um he saves these children. So come to
[22:57] find out I interview him and uh you know
[22:59] the people in there were like you know
[23:00] Bob really needs for you to help him him
[23:02] raise some money to keep these doors
[23:04] open. So uh I had no idea how bad things
[23:07] were. I just knew that he needed me to
[23:08] help raise money. So I had already
[23:10] completed my documentary that was going
[23:11] to be releasing that November like 2
[23:13] weeks later. So I ended up coming home.
[23:15] I I paid my editors to expedite the
[23:17] editing of Bob's interview and I was
[23:19] able to put together like a little
[23:21] 11minute reel that I put in the end of
[23:22] my documentary and uh it wasn't planned.
[23:25] I just randomly threw it in there. I was
[23:26] like, "Hey, if you guys can help
[23:27] support, like this is the guy to do it.
[23:29] This is the one place that you could
[23:30] donate and actually save children."
[23:32] Well, I didn't know it, but he was on um
[23:34] this was November 25th. I released my
[23:36] documentary. I was down there on
[23:38] November like 5th or 14th. So, not even
[23:41] over a twoe period. That December was
[23:42] Christmas. And in El Salvador, they
[23:45] Buchelli just passed a law where all
[23:46] companies and corporations have to pay
[23:48] their employees double uh for December.
[23:51] So whatever you pay your employees per
[23:52] month, you have to double their salary
[23:54] by law in El Salvador for Christmas,
[23:56] right, for December. So he had to pay
[23:58] double that month. Well, uh he had no he
[24:01] didn't have enough money to make
[24:02] payroll. So I put up his donation link
[24:05] and we raised almost $30,000 for him.
[24:08] Not only were we able to save the
[24:10] foundation, Robert or uh Robin, we were
[24:12] able to keep it open
[24:14] for quite possibly maybe forever now.
[24:17] Like it has enough of a runway to keep
[24:19] it on its feet and it's got so much help
[24:20] from outside sources now. All because I
[24:23] was at a Bitcoin event. Like that's how
[24:24] Bitcoin and networking in this industry
[24:26] kind of brings things together. But the
[24:29] big picture is how do you keep
[24:31] organizations like that self
[24:33] self-sufficient? and we had kind of had
[24:34] this conversation and the guy who I was
[24:37] down there interviewing, you know, Eric
[24:39] Vstacks, right? So, yeah, he was on the
[24:41] podcast. Yeah. Yeah. You've interviewed
[24:43] Eric. He's an awesome guy and he talks
[24:44] about what's called Bitcoin basically
[24:46] escape velocity and you had talked about
[24:48] Sailor kind of talking about making
[24:50] businesses immortal. So, my theory that
[24:53] I'm still kind of tossing around is
[24:55] like, can we use Bitcoin as a treasury
[24:58] reserve asset or organizations like the
[25:01] House of Life that do so much good for
[25:04] the world but are in this neverending,
[25:06] you know, cycle of like constantly
[25:08] needing to figure out how to generate
[25:10] capital to keep the doors open and then
[25:13] eventually you end up having to
[25:14] sacrifice cuz you can't afford to pay
[25:16] the right employees. you end up taking a
[25:18] bad employee and then a bad employee is
[25:20] somebody that you don't want around
[25:21] kids, right? These are environments in
[25:23] in very
[25:25] um like high-risisk and very sensitive
[25:27] environments for these children. So,
[25:28] it's important that at the very least
[25:30] these organizations have the funding
[25:32] that they need. And uh we had talked
[25:34] about some numbers, but basically my
[25:36] theory is that if you get like say your
[25:39] operating cost for your uh business are
[25:42] $100,000 a year. If you could put a
[25:44] million dollars of Bitcoin into a
[25:46] treasury reserve the first year that
[25:48] that the first day that you think about
[25:50] basically creating this organization and
[25:52] you can let that sit there for 2 years.
[25:55] Now, you could probably do it off a
[25:56] year, but I want to give that 2-year
[25:57] window just in case we have these cycles
[25:59] like we have now and Bitcoin takes a 50%
[26:01] you really don't want to sell. So, you
[26:03] kind of need to just not take your money
[26:04] out that year and then wait for it to
[26:06] come back up at least. So, I just say
[26:09] two-year buffer. But, in theory, if you
[26:12] can get um so if your operating costs
[26:15] are a uh $100,000, you would need to get
[26:18] a million dollars in your in your
[26:20] treasury reserve, right? So, what you
[26:22] need 10% of your operational cost. So,
[26:24] if I have a million dollar in that in
[26:26] that reserve and Bitcoin just goes up by
[26:28] 10% per year, in theory, I could take
[26:32] out $100,000 of
[26:35] capital, my my total value of my Bitcoin
[26:38] holdings would stay at a million and
[26:40] then the next year, if it makes 10%, it
[26:42] would stay at a million. I could take
[26:43] out another 10%. My theory is that it
[26:45] goes up by 20%. So, you would actually
[26:48] be able to take out your 10%. And then
[26:50] you're still going to grow the total
[26:52] value of your Bitcoin holdings. There
[26:54] has to be some happy medium there. And
[26:56] I'm sure people like Sailor have really
[26:57] thought this through and know it
[26:59] precise. But there is a way, I
[27:01] guarantee, to use Bitcoin as a treasury
[27:03] reserve asset to basically make
[27:06] organizations like the House of Life
[27:07] that rescue children are being
[27:09] trafficked immortal. And that's kind of
[27:10] where I'm kind of going. I want to toss
[27:12] it around. And if I'm if my theory is
[27:15] right and I'm able to stack and save
[27:16] enough Bitcoin over the next 2 to four
[27:18] years, as we go up to that next level,
[27:20] I'm most like you most likely will see
[27:22] me funding my own child trafficking
[27:25] rescue organization with my Bitcoin and
[27:28] trying to basically test out this
[27:30] theory. Now, it might be a small one. It
[27:31] might only help five kids or six kids.
[27:33] It just might be something small, but I
[27:34] want to prove and test out this theory
[27:36] because if it's done and done right,
[27:38] then you you remove the
[27:41] government's you you remove an
[27:43] organization's need to go and work with
[27:46] the government, which is what seems to
[27:48] be the common denominator and where all
[27:50] of these organizations go downhill is
[27:52] when you start allowing the government
[27:53] to get involved with babysitting
[27:55] children.
[27:56] I love that. And we often talk about how
[28:01] important it is to have the best tool.
[28:04] And there's like this extreme example of
[28:06] if you show up with a gun to a fist
[28:08] fight, you win. And uh
[28:11] financially, if you show up with Bitcoin
[28:14] versus the other ones are on a fiat
[28:17] standard, you win because you have the
[28:20] more you have the superior technology.
[28:23] And there's even this um I I just had a
[28:26] a podcast the previous episode with Trey
[28:28] Salis and we talked about retirement on
[28:30] Bitcoin. That's why it's currently on my
[28:32] mind. Um and uh we talked about how the
[28:36] FIRE community has this 4% rule. So you
[28:39] should have
[28:41] the FIRE community like uh uh uh uh
[28:44] financial independence retire early.
[28:46] Okay. You you don't know you never heard
[28:49] about fire? Oh, interesting. It's it's
[28:52] um a very popular community in personal
[28:56] finance which basically teaches hey live
[28:59] really frugally invest your money and
[29:02] then reach an investment goal and when
[29:06] you reach that goal you can live off
[29:08] your investment and be financially
[29:09] independent even with a normal job and
[29:11] you don't have to be like an
[29:12] entrepreneur. Uh it's an interesting
[29:14] concept and uh they have a very popular
[29:18] 4% rule which is a a similar concept
[29:21] that you actually you just said they
[29:23] have it let's say let's stick with that
[29:26] uh $1 million uh um if you have a
[29:29] million dollars in investments they say
[29:32] because it will outperform uh the the
[29:34] the the purchasing power a million you
[29:37] can take out 4% of that every year and
[29:41] you will have at the end of it more than
[29:43] you actually started with. Um, and now
[29:47] if you don't do it in fiat land, but
[29:50] actually do it in Bitcoin land, we now
[29:52] have or Trey Cellers has has the theory,
[29:55] you can even take out 8%. Um, every year
[29:58] and you will probably be fine over the
[30:01] next 5, 10, 20 years because 8% of a
[30:06] million is like
[30:07] $80,000. So it's actually really close
[30:10] to to the numbers you you said um uh
[30:14] which is fascinating and it all ties
[30:17] back towards if you adopt Bitcoin on
[30:21] individual uh level on a nation state
[30:24] level on uh uh child trafficking rescue
[30:28] organization level uh at a company level
[30:31] a startup level whatever it is you will
[30:34] have you you can cover your yearly
[30:37] expenses
[30:39] with the growth of Bitcoin and make your
[30:42] company immortal. And yeah, you just
[30:44] said it. This was literally the title of
[30:47] of the my Michael Sailor interview. Um,
[30:50] Bitcoin makes your company immortal. And
[30:52] he said it and he gave the theory around
[30:54] that. Uh, and it's it's super
[30:57] interesting to to think about that. And
[31:00] I love, and that's why I said it, I love
[31:02] when good people and good causes use
[31:05] that because the worst thing about
[31:07] Bitcoin is your enemy can also use it.
[31:09] Like Black Rockck can also have Bitcoin
[31:11] because it's open perilous. That's the
[31:13] worst thing about Bitcoin. Um, but it's
[31:16] so great to see that uh uh you and and
[31:19] uh how Bob I think was his name, uh also
[31:22] uses uh uses that and and kind of goes
[31:25] towards that. That's really cool to see.
[31:27] Uh thank you so much for sharing that.
[31:29] Yeah, man. And it's crazy watching the
[31:31] Bitcoin community. And like I mean I do
[31:34] this in the political
[31:36] world like all day. I I live it. I'm in
[31:39] it. I'm always around it. Um as far as
[31:42] like like support like I've gotten I
[31:45] don't want to say I've gotten no like no
[31:47] support, but like as far as like I've
[31:49] personally had support. We've we've
[31:51] raised some some money for Bob as far as
[31:53] it but as far as like people wanting to
[31:55] get involved, it's been the Bitcoiners.
[31:58] It really has been the Bitcoiners. I
[32:00] mean, I didn't reach out to bit to
[32:03] Bitcoin Vegas. This was all done by
[32:05] somebody that watched one of my
[32:07] documentaries, contacted Bob. They
[32:09] started talking and now they're in it
[32:11] and then she had some connections and
[32:12] she got us and now we're getting we're
[32:14] going out to to to speak at at I say
[32:18] Bitcoin Nashville because it was in
[32:19] Nashville last year. Bitcoin Vegas. I'm
[32:21] an idiot. I keep I just can't get that
[32:23] out of my head. The Bitcoin conference
[32:25] in Vegas. Um, I'm sure Robin, you got a
[32:27] promo code, don't you? What's your promo
[32:29] code for Bitcoin Nashville? Uh, my my my
[32:31] code is Robin. Robin, there it is.
[32:34] Robin, you guys got use code Robin to
[32:36] get you guys off the uh the discount
[32:38] over there at Bitcoin Vegas if you guys
[32:40] haven't got tickets yet cuz it's going
[32:41] to be a good time. So, um yeah, and
[32:43] actually what's what's really cool uh
[32:45] Robin, I don't know if I've told you,
[32:46] but I'm I've been working on when I
[32:49] first went to El Salvador, I was going
[32:50] to film a a Bitcoin documentary. That
[32:53] was my goal with Eric. Me and Eric were
[32:55] both going to do it together, but uh
[32:56] Eric's schedule changed and he got
[32:58] really busy. So, he wasn't able to go in
[33:00] and go on this journey with me to
[33:03] actually film the Bitcoin documentary.
[33:04] So, I've been slowly working on the
[33:07] Bitcoin documentary, just getting one
[33:08] interview. Like, I got Mike Mike
[33:10] Peterson when I was in El Salvador last
[33:12] time. You're going to be in um at the
[33:15] Bitcoin conference in Vegas. So,
[33:17] hopefully I'll get you in in Vegas and
[33:18] maybe some other people there as well.
[33:20] If you got anybody that is interested or
[33:22] whatever, maybe we could do a couple
[33:23] interviews together and, uh, I'll have
[33:24] all my equipment, too. So, if you need
[33:26] anything, um, let me know and you can
[33:28] just borrow my equipment or I can film
[33:29] it for you if you need anything. I'll
[33:30] have all my gear with me. So, um, but
[33:32] yeah, so we're going to speak there and,
[33:34] uh, I have a documentary on El Salvador
[33:37] and it's called The Great El Salvadorian
[33:39] comeback, uh, God b Kelly in Bitcoin and
[33:42] it's, it should should be finished in
[33:44] about 3 weeks, but I think I'm going to
[33:45] try to hold out and I might release it
[33:47] during uh, the Bitcoin conference, which
[33:50] I think would be pretty cool. Maybe I
[33:51] can get them to let me uh, do a free
[33:54] screening of it there and and at an
[33:56] after event or something. I don't know.
[33:57] I'm going to try to work some angles
[33:58] once it gets done on I have a trailer.
[34:00] I'm going to I actually have a a a
[34:03] trailer for it I can send you as well if
[34:05] you're interested in seeing it and you
[34:06] can just it'll just give you a little
[34:08] taste. I had three different editors
[34:10] that that work for me. So my third
[34:12] editor tried to edit this the first time
[34:15] and he ended up getting busy with exams.
[34:17] So we had to stop editing it after he
[34:19] finished the trailer. So then I have
[34:20] another editor that's completely redone
[34:22] the whole thing. So it'll probably be a
[34:24] little bit different but this will give
[34:25] you a taste of what it's going to be
[34:26] like. And it's actually a really really
[34:28] good trailer. So, I'm super excited
[34:30] because it highlights, you know, what
[34:33] what Bitcoin has done for El Salvador
[34:35] and how it's exponentially changed the
[34:38] life of every single citizen in that
[34:40] country. What are your thoughts on um El
[34:44] Salvador making Bitcoin not legal
[34:46] tender? Let's take a break for a moment
[34:48] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[34:51] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[34:54] watches. Those watches are the most
[34:56] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[34:59] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[35:03] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[35:05] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:08] watch collections. You have the date of
[35:11] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[35:14] there. And of course, also the block
[35:16] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:19] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:22] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:25] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:28] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:30] love those watches so so much. And now
[35:33] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:36] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:38] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:40] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[35:42] first way is you put it on a hardware
[35:44] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[35:47] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[35:50] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[35:53] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[35:56] if you check out the link in the
[35:58] description, you even get 5% off if you
[36:01] use the code Robin. And the second way
[36:03] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[36:07] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[36:10] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:13] They will personalize for you a
[36:15] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:18] your individual situation. They will
[36:21] show you how you can secure your own
[36:23] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:25] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:27] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:30] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:32] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:35] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:38] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:40] last but not least, if you're in a
[36:42] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[36:44] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[36:47] that, head over to the
[36:51] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:54] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:56] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:59] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[37:02] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[37:04] really looking forward to seeing all of
[37:06] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:09] the link down in the description of
[37:11] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[37:13] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:17] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:19] there. I love that. And I mean, there
[37:22] has been some controversy around the IMF
[37:24] deal recently. Um, I personally think uh
[37:29] it was a a clever move of of of N Bule
[37:32] actually uh of of doing a deck because
[37:34] he didn't lose anything and He he has uh
[37:39] definitely more leverage now. Um Bitcoin
[37:43] is as we say uh it gives the right in we
[37:47] always say fix the money fix the world
[37:48] and Bitcoin fixes the money but there's
[37:51] some fundamental truth to that. There's
[37:54] something extremely powerful when you
[37:56] adopt Bitcoin on an individual level on
[37:59] a nation street level on whatever level
[38:01] you you you take it. I have seen it so
[38:04] many times and I think my podcast is
[38:06] also a testament a little bit to towards
[38:08] that because I interview not only the
[38:11] Michael sailors the the big ones but I
[38:14] interview people that have never been on
[38:15] a podcast before they just want to share
[38:17] the Bitcoin story and one thing that
[38:19] always comes out that Bitcoin is always
[38:22] a a fork in in the road of their own
[38:25] personal journey. Something happens
[38:27] there. I mean, of course, there are
[38:29] people that have done very well before
[38:31] Bitcoin and done even better afterwards.
[38:34] Um, but there's a lot of people where
[38:38] they adopted Bitcoin and they got hope
[38:40] back. All of the sudden they can save in
[38:44] something. They never had savings. And
[38:47] it's actually u my my girlfriend
[38:49] actually uh experienced that herself.
[38:51] She never had savings in her life. Now
[38:53] she experienced Bitcoin. Now she's
[38:55] excited about saving. She's like, I'm
[38:57] I'm so looking forward to the salary to
[39:00] just save a few hundred dollars each
[39:02] month to to Bitcoin. And it's because
[39:04] she now all of the sudden has hope again
[39:07] of like, oh, I can actually accumulate
[39:09] something. I can actually do something
[39:12] uh with that. And this financial
[39:14] stability, this financial uh security is
[39:18] something that gives a
[39:20] nation
[39:22] extremely hopeful thinking in the most
[39:26] positive way of we can turn this thing
[39:28] around and and El Salvador has a lot of
[39:31] like a a long way to go. It's it's not
[39:35] completely fixed, I would say. It's not
[39:36] it's not like it went from uh uh 2020 to
[39:41] now. It's it's a perfect country. Uh
[39:43] obviously it's it's it's a way harder
[39:45] story. Um but it's extremely impressive
[39:49] what they have done. I'm I'm
[39:53] super super impressed with the stories.
[39:56] I've heard how El Salvador was before
[39:58] and how I have seen it last November
[40:01] when I was there. I felt super safe. The
[40:04] country is really really cool. It's kind
[40:06] of clean also. There was not like I I
[40:08] expected not not that clean of a
[40:11] country. The people are extremely
[40:14] hopeful and extremely positive and
[40:17] extremely nice, way nicer than they are
[40:19] in Europe. Uh so you you you have a
[40:24] country that has true potential and that
[40:27] is partially because of Bitcoin. uh and
[40:29] also partially just because Bu and and
[40:31] the team and and and the the country and
[40:34] and the the people are just uh in in the
[40:37] right place of mind. So I'm really uh
[40:41] looking forward to seeing El Salvador in
[40:44] 10 years, 20 years because then you can
[40:47] really see differences. Now we can see
[40:49] differences uh on a on a on a smaller
[40:51] level or like on a beginning stage level
[40:54] but those will be immense if they keep
[40:57] going in 10 20
[40:59] years. Wait till you see my film
[41:02] brother. It's going to blow your mind.
[41:04] I'm going to walk you through what Al
[41:06] Salvador looked like in the
[41:07] 60s all the way to 2019. And during that
[41:11] period of time, the United States
[41:12] government funneled $7.5 billion dollars
[41:15] into El Salvador and turned it over that
[41:18] period of time and turned it into the
[41:20] deadliest country in the world. Buchelli
[41:22] comes in 2019, first thing he does is
[41:25] start cutting off funding from USAID and
[41:28] all these organizations, right? Starts
[41:30] investigating the corruption inside of
[41:32] this cabinet, gets rid of as many
[41:33] corrupt politicians as he can. Then at
[41:36] the two and a half year mark, he had
[41:39] just started finishing those mega
[41:40] prisons. He had started building those
[41:42] prisons, right? Got those prisons,
[41:44] started putting cartel members in those
[41:45] prisons. And that's when the cartel
[41:47] members went on a murdering like, "Oh
[41:49] yeah, you're going to crack down on us."
[41:50] And they went around and they
[41:51] slaughtered in one day 63 innocent
[41:53] civilians. They just went on a rampage
[41:55] and didn't matter who you were, they
[41:56] were just killing people to kill people.
[41:59] And that's when there was so much in
[42:01] that weekend I think they killed 172 if
[42:04] I'm not mistaken in one weekend innocent
[42:06] people. So that created so much public
[42:09] outrage that even the Democrats on the
[42:12] left couldn't vote against Buch. Kelly
[42:14] on this one vote that gave him the
[42:16] ability to suspend the Constitution. He
[42:19] then went and passed a law that stated
[42:22] basically any gang if you're basically
[42:23] covered in from head to toe and you have
[42:25] teardrops and you know that show how
[42:27] many people you've killed, you don't get
[42:29] a court date. You go straight to prison
[42:32] for life and you're never going to see
[42:33] the light of day again. And he's
[42:35] arrested 88,000 of the most deadly and
[42:38] violent gangbangers on the face of the
[42:40] earth and he's turned out El Salvador.
[42:42] And then on top of that, then after
[42:44] that, he at the two at his I believe
[42:47] this was at his last he just got
[42:49] reelected, right? And this was uh his
[42:51] for his second 5-year
[42:53] term. I believe that day on the day that
[42:56] he won his re-election was the day that
[42:57] he ordered his entire cabinet. At some
[42:59] point, he comes in and he orders his
[43:02] sergeant-at-arms to to investigate
[43:04] everybody in this room. And that was his
[43:06] entire cabinet. And I believe he got rid
[43:07] of one more, I think, Supreme Court
[43:09] judge and two more politicians if I'm
[43:11] not mistaken. And now and they've also
[43:13] impeached the corrupt judges which we're
[43:15] kind of seeing here in America. And
[43:16] that's why you see people like Buchelli
[43:17] saying you got to impeach the corrupt
[43:19] judges. They're not they're not
[43:20] following the constitution. They have to
[43:22] go. But either way, he's now turned that
[43:25] country into the safest country in Latin
[43:26] America. Like you said, it is safe. The
[43:29] people are so happy there. Robin, I was
[43:31] I just bought property there, right? So,
[43:33] I bought um some land in El Salvador and
[43:36] in the process of buying the land, I had
[43:37] flew down there to get the land and I
[43:39] had rented this truck and I was like,
[43:40] "Okay, this this big truck in El
[43:42] Salvador." Like, you could you imagine
[43:43] driving like a big four-door truck on
[43:45] those small roads in El Salvador. I
[43:47] mean, they're tiny. You got this big
[43:49] truck and it's it ain't like roads in
[43:51] America or in Europe. I mean, it's
[43:52] tight. You can't move anywhere. So, long
[43:56] story short, I was just like, "Oh, I
[43:58] can't do this anymore." Sorry. I uh I
[44:02] was like, I can't I can't drive this
[44:03] truck. I'm just going to go buy a car. I
[44:05] Okay, cool. How do I buy a car? Oh, I
[44:06] need cash here. All right, cool. How am
[44:08] I getting cash? Oh, Bitcoin ATM, right?
[44:10] So, I'm like, all right, I'm going to go
[44:11] from ATM to ATM to ATM till I can get
[44:13] out enough cash. Well, by the time I got
[44:15] out enough cash, it was like 8 or 9:00
[44:17] at night. I couldn't buy the car, so I'm
[44:19] just going to go to Uber
[44:20] home. Not realizing that there's two
[44:23] roads in El Salvador that are basically
[44:24] named the same thing. I copied this what
[44:27] I thought was the address and I searched
[44:29] it in in Uber and what popped up
[44:32] was they're the exact same road but one
[44:35] of them had like something a little bit
[44:36] different in the front and I clicked the
[44:38] wrong one. So me just being on my phone
[44:40] I hop in this Uber and I'm not paying
[44:42] attention. I'm just like man it feels
[44:43] like it's been we've been driving for a
[44:44] long time but it's El Salvador.
[44:45] Sometimes you go 3 miles and it takes 15
[44:48] minutes. Sometimes it takes like
[44:50] literally like 2 hours, right? So I was
[44:51] just like whatever. Not paying
[44:52] attention. Just on my phone in the back
[44:54] of the car. 40 minutes later I get to
[44:56] this place and I look around like this
[44:57] doesn't look like my place but when you
[44:59] get dropped off in El Salvador and
[45:00] you're going to all these other places
[45:02] like a lot of times like you you're not
[45:04] you don't recognize it but then you like
[45:05] walk around the street like oh there
[45:07] that's where my place was right so I was
[45:08] like okay maybe the Uber dropped me off
[45:09] in the wrong I get out now remind you I
[45:12] got like over $10,000 cash in my
[45:15] backpack right I get out of this Uber
[45:18] and uh I'm like this ain't right but I'm
[45:20] like maybe it's right around the street
[45:21] and I start walking and walking I'm like
[45:23] okay this definitely ain't it. Now, I go
[45:26] to my phone and I just hit my my actual
[45:28] like I had the address and my thing
[45:30] saved in there and I look at my map and
[45:32] I'm like, dude, I'm 40 minutes away and
[45:35] then I start looking around and I
[45:37] go, "Oh boy, I'm in a bad area." Like, I
[45:40] got dropped off in a really bad area or
[45:42] at one at one point was a bad area.
[45:44] Right? These are the areas where, you
[45:46] know, they have the they're basically
[45:48] solid cement walls, but they're 12 feet
[45:50] tall and they're in front of your
[45:52] property, right? And then they don't
[45:54] just have the regular gates in front of
[45:55] their property. They have the solid
[45:57] steel gates. Like some of the places
[45:59] just have like a wooden door that opens
[46:00] and just kind of blocks people from like
[46:02] ramming through. And then certain areas
[46:03] have like the solid steel gates so that
[46:05] like if gunfire breaks out like the
[46:08] bullets aren't going into the house. And
[46:10] then on top of that they have the the
[46:11] the Constantine razor wire on top of
[46:13] those cement walls. And then so I'm like
[46:16] now I'm walking around. I'm like okay
[46:18] how long is my next Uber to get here?
[46:19] I'm like Uber Uber Uber Uber. Should I
[46:22] order my Uber? It's 40 minutes away for
[46:24] the next Uber to get to me. So, I'm
[46:26] like, [ __ ] I got a lot of money. It's
[46:28] getting dark now, right? So, now I'm 40
[46:30] minutes after I left at 9:00. So, now
[46:32] it's probably getting closer to like
[46:33] 10:30, almost 11:00 and I'm out in this
[46:35] really bad area and I'm walk and I'm
[46:38] just walking for a second. Like, I don't
[46:39] know if I want to stand here and pretend
[46:40] like I I look like I'm lost or if I
[46:42] should just start aimlessly walking,
[46:43] right? And then kind of come back to
[46:45] meet my Uber back here. Um, so I I kind
[46:48] of pause there for a second and all of a
[46:50] sudden I hear laughter and I hear
[46:53] footsteps and then next thing I know
[46:55] there's a 12 and a 13. I'm just guessing
[46:57] on age. It could have been 11 and 10. It
[46:59] could have been 14 and 15, but but like
[47:01] it looked like a 13 and a 14year-old boy
[47:02] and girl laughing, kicking a soccer ball
[47:05] come running down the road. And I look
[47:07] around a little bit more and there's a
[47:08] family up on on uh like up over this
[47:11] hill on their in their in their yard
[47:14] thing having like this barbecue thing,
[47:16] right? And then there's this party store
[47:18] behind me and there's this little girl
[47:20] out there um you know like by like the
[47:22] coke sign and like like waving, right?
[47:24] And I was like, "Oh, party store. I'll
[47:26] walk over to the party store." Walk in
[47:27] just so nice, so polite. Dude, I didn't
[47:30] have a worry in the world. five two or
[47:34] three years ago, I probably would have
[47:36] been killed and robbed before I even
[47:38] made it into that party store in that
[47:39] area. Right then you could see in the
[47:41] walls cuz they're all that that cement
[47:43] stucco, but they've been painted over.
[47:45] But you could see that you you can I
[47:49] mean maybe it wasn't a bullet, but I
[47:50] mean those dots are, you know, pretty
[47:53] common for for bullet like a bullet hit
[47:55] that cement and left that little, you
[47:57] know, divot there. So you could see the
[47:59] bullet holes all in these stucco walls.
[48:01] At one point there were some shootouts
[48:03] there. So, you know, that's what
[48:05] Buchelli's done to that country. And how
[48:07] did he do it? Fixed the money, right? At
[48:10] the very at the first, this is their
[48:11] first year, I think, that they're going
[48:13] to have a a surplus budget. So, he's
[48:16] balanced his budget. He's eradicated the
[48:18] corruption from politics and he cut off
[48:20] foreign foreign money from influencing
[48:23] his country. And it's it's that simple.
[48:26] I mean, it is the safest, beautiful,
[48:28] happiest. I mean, if I could retire in
[48:31] some place, I think forever, I think it
[48:32] would be El Salvador. At the very least,
[48:33] for the next 5 to 10 years, like you
[48:35] said. Yeah. It's
[48:37] amazing.
[48:39] And this story I heard, I mean, not this
[48:44] story, but similar stories from people
[48:46] that have been to El Salvador before and
[48:48] came back or have been living in El
[48:50] Salvador all the time. I've heard at
[48:53] least three, four times from completely
[48:55] different people. And it's amazing to
[48:58] see how safe it is again because once a
[49:02] country is safe again and the people are
[49:05] hopeful again then things can build on
[49:08] top of that. If they don't feel safe why
[49:11] should they build anything in that
[49:12] country? If they if they if they don't
[49:15] feel if you want to build a business and
[49:18] you're not sure if one day a gang comes
[49:21] along and gets all your money and and uh
[49:24] maybe kills your family, you will not
[49:27] build anything in that country. You're
[49:29] trying to survive or get out of the
[49:30] country. And this the security that
[49:33] comes from that is really crucial to
[49:37] build anything. And then you they also
[49:40] adopt Bitcoin and they're innovative.
[49:42] They're kind they're loving
[49:44] personalities. Uh and uh it's it's a
[49:47] safe clean place. So I have a lot of
[49:50] hope for El Salv I I I do have a lot of
[49:53] I see a lot of positive things. Yeah,
[49:55] Robin, I wouldn't let my my 11year-old
[49:59] son and I live in a in a
[50:02] fairly rich I would say white community,
[50:06] right? I want to say rich, but a nice,
[50:08] you know, there's probably not a home in
[50:10] this area for under
[50:11] $125,000, right? So, it's like, and
[50:15] whatever. So, it's got like a homeowners
[50:17] association. I wouldn't let my son walk
[50:21] to the park by himself. Okay.
[50:25] In El Salvador, I was watching what
[50:27] looked like a seven-year-old girl
[50:30] walking her 5-year-old brother to school
[50:33] through a town that would that would
[50:36] remind me of
[50:37] like almost like Time Square, right?
[50:40] Like there were people everywhere. There
[50:42] were so many so many people that like
[50:44] traffic was like bumper to bumper
[50:46] because like every time one car would
[50:48] go, you'd have to stop and wait for more
[50:49] people to cross the road. It was just
[50:50] like a never- ending people everywhere.
[50:53] And I and it wasn't just one, Robin. I
[50:55] seen a bunch all like all over the
[50:57] place. It looked like just kids were
[50:59] walking themselves to school without
[51:01] their parents. And I thought to myself,
[51:04] like if I would have seen that anywhere
[51:06] else, I would have been like, dude,
[51:07] those kids are going to one of these
[51:08] it'll just be a day or two before
[51:09] somebody snatches one of these kids in
[51:11] Al Salvador. Oh no, no. It's like
[51:14] they've arrested all the criminals and
[51:16] once they did, it's like like normal
[51:19] people like us don't want to commit
[51:20] crimes, right? So when you put the true
[51:22] criminals in prison and there's no and
[51:24] people aren't incentivized to commit
[51:26] crime, right? Because in El Salvador,
[51:28] the punishment is in you're in one of
[51:30] those prisons with those dudes and and
[51:32] you really don't want to be there. So
[51:34] whatever reward you're going to have to
[51:36] give me is going to have to be
[51:38] exponential. Like I'm not just going to
[51:39] go, you know, start selling some drugs
[51:42] for some, you know, from peanuts, right?
[51:44] I'm not going to go rob somebody's car
[51:48] so I can eat one time because I might
[51:50] end up in that for years, right? So,
[51:53] let's just maybe I just getting a job is
[51:55] the best way to go. And then you see
[51:57] these people, it doesn't matter if it's
[51:59] the person pumping your gas. It doesn't
[52:01] matter if it's the person flipping your
[52:02] burgers at Wendy's or the waitress
[52:04] that's serving your Pizza Hut at Pizza
[52:07] Hut. They couldn't be more proud to be
[52:10] working. It's like you look at a uh
[52:14] let's say a 21-year-old that's working
[52:16] at McDonald's in America or Wendy's in
[52:18] America. You're hoping they don't spit
[52:20] on your food. They look so miserable.
[52:22] You know, Salvador like they're all
[52:24] smiles. You need a
[52:26] napkin. And and the sad part is like
[52:28] these people would give you the shirt
[52:30] off their back too, you know, and
[52:32] they're the nicest, kindest, most humble
[52:35] and hopeful people in the world. And I
[52:37] think that El Salvador in 5 years will
[52:38] be the next to buy. I don't think it's
[52:40] going to take 10. I love that. And it
[52:44] will be awesome to to look back at that
[52:47] conversation in in five 10 years and and
[52:48] and see may maybe we can even record it
[52:51] in in El Salvador, make an inerson
[52:53] podcast there in in 5 years and and and
[52:55] look back uh how how the development has
[52:58] went. I think that that's what I'm I'm
[53:01] most excited actually about documenting
[53:03] in in in public. Uh then I can see uh uh
[53:07] in five ten years how clever or stupid I
[53:10] was at that time.
[53:13] Well, we can record it at my place down
[53:15] there because I'm um I'm building my
[53:17] house will be done. Well, it's actually
[53:19] getting shipped out here in about uh
[53:21] about two weeks. I built one of those
[53:22] dome homes. I don't know if you ever
[53:23] seen they're like the giant bubbles.
[53:26] Dome homes. Yeah, man. I'll show you
[53:28] one. They're really freaking cool.
[53:30] They're like this. Uh, so if you it's
[53:32] the the
[53:33] domeros.com is the company that I'm
[53:35] using. Uh, you guys can use code mata
[53:38] over there. If you ever see one of these
[53:39] dome homes that you like, just use code
[53:41] code mata and they'll hook you up. Um,
[53:43] they're uh they're an awesome group of
[53:45] guys, man. And you you can get these
[53:47] homes for depending on the size of the
[53:50] So go to that that one in the
[53:54] top. They're not the solid clear
[53:56] bubbles. They're the Yeah. So like uh
[53:59] that's that could be one of them in the
[54:00] inside. But uh the one on the right
[54:02] there with the two homes that are
[54:03] connected. Yeah. That's what they
[54:05] basically look like on the inside.
[54:06] That's what mine will look like. But I'm
[54:08] building mine on the side of a mountain.
[54:10] So when you look out my front window
[54:12] like that, it's going to be over a
[54:14] mountain cliff. Awesome. Wow. I've never
[54:16] seen dome homes. Let me see if I can
[54:18] send you a I think I got mine right
[54:21] here. I can send you a picture of what
[54:22] mine in theory is supposed to look like.
[54:24] Be pretty cool, man. I'm excited for it.
[54:26] That's for sure. So yeah, inside one of
[54:28] those I'm going to build a uh a giant
[54:31] studio. So it'll be uh be a really cool
[54:34] place to record, I think. As soon as
[54:37] it's finished, let me know. I will I
[54:38] will plan my trip to El Salvador and
[54:40] I'll and I'll have a place uh down there
[54:42] as well. So if you and your uh your
[54:44] girlfriend ever need to go down there
[54:45] for a couple days and you don't feel
[54:46] like renting a place, just let me know
[54:48] and I'll just uh you stay at my place
[54:50] for free. Oh, thank you so much. I
[54:52] appreciate that. Yep. So yeah, there's
[54:54] one down there in the mountains. That's
[54:55] it. Sweet, dude. I'm so excited, man.
[54:57] What do you got going on over the next
[54:58] Where do you see yourself in the next 2
[55:00] years? Um, you mean lo from a lo uh from
[55:04] uh the location? Yeah. Like what do you
[55:06] see yourself? Are you are you hoping to
[55:08] take your what you're doing uh and move
[55:11] or you got you stay and put where you're
[55:12] at? There is two like what what I do I
[55:16] can take wherever I I want. I I I have
[55:20] zero income from Austria. So I'm
[55:22] currently living in Austria. like
[55:24] there's nothing binding me to Austria.
[55:27] Um I I I'm still very hopeful that maybe
[55:31] situations uh change for the better and
[55:34] every day I'm kind of proven wrong uh
[55:37] and getting less hopeful uh in in that
[55:39] regard. But
[55:41] even in Austria uh but I I'm still
[55:45] hopeful. Maybe it's young and naive but
[55:48] I'm I'm I'm still hopeful for Austria
[55:50] and Europe.
[55:51] I'm one that actually wants to stay
[55:54] close to the family. I want to stay
[55:56] close to to my roots. I I want to build
[55:58] something meaningful and and and big in
[56:00] in in Austria.
[56:03] But if if they are doing something very
[56:06] wrong, if I see the uh direction in in
[56:09] in a going in a very wrong direction,
[56:12] I'm taking my microphone, my camera,
[56:16] which is very easy to take. Uh and and
[56:18] my girlfriend and and just take it where
[56:20] wherever I want to take it. Um where it
[56:24] it would go, I don't know. It's a very
[56:27] hard thing to say because El Salvo is so
[56:31] far away from Austria. I I traveled
[56:33] there last November. H and it was around
[56:36] 23 hours with the plane. Uh when you
[56:41] encount everything like going to the
[56:44] like from house to house basically uh
[56:46] the flight itself is a little
[56:48] shorter. So and there are no direct
[56:50] flights also. So I have to fly over
[56:54] Canada or America. So, uh, this is a
[56:58] little bit complicated. So, I I want to
[57:00] stay closer to to Austria, to the
[57:02] family. Even if I'm outside of Austria,
[57:04] I I I don't want to be that far away.
[57:06] So, I'm probably not in El Salvador,
[57:09] honestly, even though I like the country
[57:11] a lot and I I visited
[57:12] there. And right now, if I had to leave
[57:16] Austria, um, I would look into Madiraa.
[57:19] I would look into Dubai. I would look
[57:21] into Switzerland uh because Switzerland
[57:23] is outside of um uh the EU. Uh so might
[57:26] be a few years better than Austria. Uh
[57:30] so there are certain places like I have
[57:32] you go to Malaysia
[57:34] that is also a place that I actually uh
[57:37] looked it also depends like what is the
[57:39] financial situation at that point. um
[57:42] depending on on what's what's what's how
[57:45] much wealth you have it depends on on
[57:47] where you can go or what makes sense for
[57:50] it also like what's the income and
[57:52] what's the business uh situation then uh
[57:55] there's so many factors there um that I
[57:59] that I have to consider. So in two years
[58:02] I'm probably hopefully still in Austria
[58:05] uh or uh in a situation where I have two
[58:10] three um uh standpoints where I'm like
[58:13] okay I hear something I hear something I
[58:15] hear something and uh I just I'm not in
[58:19] any country more than uh half a year uh
[58:22] which would give me a lot of freedom. I
[58:24] thought about it uh a lot. Um uh but
[58:28] there's no concrete plan up until now
[58:31] because I'm still happy with the way
[58:33] things go in Austria. Um but this could
[58:37] change and it also depends highly on
[58:40] what the EU is doing and and and how
[58:42] things play out. And I'm highly like I'm
[58:46] I'm very easy movable. I my business is
[58:48] completely online. Uh I have uh partners
[58:51] in America, Switzerland, everywhere. Uh
[58:55] I can just go and nobody I just need a
[58:58] white wall behind me and nobody would
[59:00] even notice that I'm somewhere else. So
[59:02] that it's super easy for me to to uh to
[59:05] to move uh and take my girlfriend
[59:08] wherever uh we we we take she is not
[59:10] from Austria. So she's from India. Uh so
[59:13] it's not like she's getting away from
[59:15] the family. Uh anyways, so I'm I'm her
[59:19] family here in Austria. So uh if if we
[59:21] go, she she would just come come with me
[59:23] or if she wants to go, I would come with
[59:25] her. That that's my current state from
[59:28] locationwise. Uh so maybe I don't know
[59:31] if it's a satisfactory answer. No, man.
[59:34] That's an absolute great answer, man. Uh
[59:37] dude, I'm so stoked to see where you're
[59:38] at, bro. You're up to 14,000 now over on
[59:42] YouTube. Congratulations, brother. What
[59:45] were you at? What were you at in our
[59:46] first interview? Like a couple thousand
[59:47] or something like that? Yeah, I just
[59:49] started. I think I think uh it was
[59:51] probably like a year ago and I got
[59:54] monetized I know in March last year. So
[59:58] this is a year ago and you get monetized
[60:01] when you reach 1,000 subscribers. Yeah.
[60:04] So uh it's I probably had like 2,000
[60:06] subscribers maybe. And um I had no not
[60:10] really had a lot of sponsors or I
[60:12] couldn't sustain myself even. Now I can
[60:15] sustain myself and have um
[60:17] post-production team. Uh with team is
[60:20] like three people that work part-time
[60:21] but uh it's like more or less one
[60:24] employee uh if you count them together.
[60:26] Uh so it's it's been a great journey uh
[60:30] uh doing the podcast and now I'm also
[60:32] invited to speak at uh Vegas. I'm
[60:34] invited to speak at Prague and all all
[60:36] those places. uh and not because I pay
[60:39] for a slot or because I have a company
[60:42] uh that pays for a slot just because
[60:44] they uh invited me to speak there. I I
[60:47] don't know. I've never maybe I've never
[60:50] uh talked about that actually uh on the
[60:52] podcast. The first time I ever went to
[60:55] speak on a conference was last year in
[60:57] Amsterdam and I wanted to go to Bitcoin
[61:00] Amsterdam, also organized from Bitcoin
[61:02] magazine, the same guys that do Bitcoin
[61:04] Las Vegas. Mhm. and I just wanted to
[61:07] have a press pass because I didn't want
[61:09] to pay for the ticket. I was like, "Hey,
[61:11] can can I have a press pass?" And the
[61:13] guy, Greg, writes me back and says, "Uh,
[61:16] no, but we would love to have you as a
[61:18] speaker." And uh this is how I entered
[61:20] the the the the speaker scene uh in in
[61:23] in in Bitcoin because there's one guy
[61:26] Craig that just believed in me and said
[61:27] like oh like I've never seen you in any
[61:29] stage but I've seen your podcast so
[61:31] please come on our main stage in
[61:33] Amsterdam in front of 2,000 people in
[61:36] person and like 10,000 in in the stream
[61:39] and I've never talked before that uh at
[61:43] any stage. So that that was pretty that
[61:46] was pretty significant for me. Were you
[61:48] nervous getting up there the first time?
[61:49] It's weird going out on a stage like
[61:50] that, isn't it? The first time it was
[61:53] more than I was more than nervous. Um
[61:55] because I like this was two sides for
[61:57] me. Like I have done I was not giving a
[62:01] talk. I did not had a presentation. I
[62:03] had a I moderated a panel. So I
[62:06] moderated a panel with three other
[62:08] people. So I knew it's basically the
[62:10] same thing that I'm doing in a podcast.
[62:11] I'm I'm giving credit.
[62:14] That that's what what was was good for
[62:17] me. But it's very different to a podcast
[62:19] because some people actually watch you
[62:21] live.
[62:23] Uh, and you have like the headphones uh,
[62:26] and you walk on stage and like there's a
[62:28] whole thing with like getting your
[62:30] microphone right and like the nervous
[62:32] uh, the the things are building up and
[62:35] uh, it's just whole it's a whole
[62:37] different game and I was super nervous
[62:40] and as soon as we as soon as I start
[62:43] talking I just focused on the other
[62:46] speakers and after two three minutes I
[62:48] forgot that I'm on stage because I just
[62:50] went full into podcast out. I I was like
[62:53] just talking with them uh and uh then it
[62:57] was over after half an hour because that
[62:58] you have the clock there and they said
[63:01] like oh don't don't go further don't go
[63:03] further and the clock was running and I
[63:05] was like oh we are already above above
[63:07] the time we have to wrap it up now uh
[63:09] because I was so into podcast mode and I
[63:13] just go with like we are now already
[63:14] recording over an hour and you're just
[63:16] one guy and there I had three guys so I
[63:19] could go on for like three hours with
[63:21] with them.
[63:23] Time goes by quick when you're up there,
[63:24] doesn't it? It absolutely does. And also
[63:27] one one maybe small uh story around
[63:30] that. After 10 minutes, so we prepared
[63:33] what we will say a little bit. Um but
[63:36] after 10 minutes, our script went like
[63:39] we we we covered everything that we
[63:41] discussed. So, uh, the podcast mode
[63:44] really started and, uh, from if if
[63:47] someone watched the 30-inut clip, uh, I
[63:49] think it's probably on the Bitcoin
[63:50] magazine YouTube channel somewhere. Uh,
[63:53] after 10 minutes, uh, all my
[63:55] pre-prepared questions were done. And
[63:58] from the the next 20 minutes, I just
[64:01] improvise of like what I think might be
[64:03] interesting. And improvising in front of
[64:06] like 2,000 people and 10,000 watching
[64:08] live. That that was a scary thing, but I
[64:11] loved it. And then I did it in Abu Dhabi
[64:13] the same thing in the in Samodora MC
[64:16] even uh and uh I will be on a panel in
[64:20] in Vegas. I I I don't know if it's on
[64:22] the main stage or on on a side stage uh
[64:24] till now, but uh either way it will be
[64:27] it will be so cool. So I'm really stoked
[64:30] to also see you finally in person. It it
[64:32] feels like I know you since years and
[64:33] I've never seen you in person. Yeah,
[64:35] man. I'm going to come and uh when
[64:38] you're when you're doing that panel, let
[64:39] me know um what time and day that is
[64:41] there and I'll come and shoot some uh
[64:43] some B-roll in the crowd and give you
[64:44] some behind the scenes stuff. Oh, that
[64:47] would be awesome. Wow. I love that.
[64:49] Yeah. Um one last topic that I want to
[64:52] uh cover because I know you have your
[64:54] live show uh coming up. Um one last
[64:56] topic that I'm really interested in um
[64:59] and we covered it last time also and I
[65:00] want to kind of get an updated thing on
[65:03] that. We talked about freedom of speech
[65:05] and the platforms that they they they
[65:07] currently have. How do you look at um
[65:11] YouTube, Twitter, Nostra and all those
[65:13] different platforms that we have now and
[65:15] even Zuckerberg now uh remove the
[65:19] filters and went on to Joe Rogan and all
[65:21] those things. How do you look at the
[65:24] social media landscape and censorship
[65:26] resistance and and all those? And maybe
[65:29] also is it getting better compared to
[65:32] like one year or maybe even worse? So,
[65:34] it really it's really interesting to
[65:36] watch what we're seeing here in America
[65:38] anyways because uh there's one specific
[65:42] topic that you cannot talk about or say,
[65:45] right? I can say anything negative about
[65:47] America, my own government, my own
[65:49] politicians, but the second I talk about
[65:50] Israel, right? You're basically
[65:53] deplatformed, censored, shut down,
[65:55] kicked off of every platform on the face
[65:58] of the earth except for X right now. But
[66:01] they will demonetize you on X for
[66:04] speaking out too much against Israel.
[66:06] So, it's really interesting to see how
[66:08] free speech has really, you know,
[66:10] YouTube was the most censored uh the
[66:13] most secure platform and Tik Tok
[66:15] actually used to be the place where all
[66:17] the, you know, like the Palestine and
[66:20] Gaza and Israel stuff was actually
[66:22] blowing up on Tik Tok and then that
[66:25] forced our politicians to ban Tik Tok in
[66:28] America. And now Tik Tok has just
[66:30] deplatformed like every single
[66:32] conservative last week or this like this
[66:34] was like 3 days ago. They just went on a
[66:36] purge and like all conservatives are
[66:38] basically nuked off of Tik Tok. So Tik
[66:41] Tok's probably one of the most censored
[66:42] and compromised platforms right now
[66:44] because and I say that because my DMs
[66:47] were blowing up this week about people
[66:48] complaining that they're now getting
[66:50] like five or 10 times more views on
[66:52] Instagram and Facebook than they are on
[66:55] Tik Tok, which is the complete night and
[66:57] day opposite. So Zuckerberg seems to be
[67:00] following through and and and making
[67:03] free speech a thing again on on Facebook
[67:06] again until you talk about one thing,
[67:08] right? So there's free speech in
[67:10] America. As long as you're not being
[67:12] negative or criticizing Israel, um if
[67:15] you are pro- Israel and you support
[67:17] Israel and and like you're like a
[67:19] diehard Israel loyalist, um everything
[67:21] you put out will be amplified to the max
[67:22] and they'll they'll amplify your voice
[67:24] more than any other anybody else around
[67:25] you. So, I don't know if you call it
[67:28] free speech. I think that Noster is the
[67:30] future. I think that the Noster
[67:32] community and the Bitcoin community as a
[67:34] whole during the Tik Tok ban missed the
[67:37] biggest opportunity in the lifetime. Uh
[67:40] you know that uh red line or red vine or
[67:43] whatever that uh new Chinese Tik Tok is.
[67:46] So basically in America they were try
[67:48] they were banning Tik Tok. They banned
[67:49] Tik Tok because they said that the
[67:52] Chinese because it was a Chinese
[67:54] companies and we were giving a Chinese
[67:55] company to access to all of our personal
[67:57] information and they shouldn't have that
[67:59] information. So, Americans wanted to
[68:01] send a big middle finger to our
[68:02] government. So, we all went and got on
[68:05] on the app store and we downloaded some
[68:08] random random like the new Tik Tok. It's
[68:11] called like Red Vine or Red Stripe or
[68:13] whatever it was. And in 24
[68:16] hours, it became the number one
[68:18] downloaded app in the world with 150
[68:20] million downloads in 24 hours. 150
[68:23] million new users on one social media
[68:25] platform in 24 hours. That should have
[68:28] been Noster. And if that push would have
[68:31] made it to Noster and all 150 million
[68:34] people got on Noster in one day, oh my
[68:38] lord, dude. It would have been it would
[68:40] have been over. So I'm expecting
[68:42] something like that to happen. There
[68:44] will come some push unless we go to
[68:46] complete free speech and it's like
[68:49] solidified in our constitution and laws
[68:51] are implemented that if a social media
[68:53] platform or a government or anybody
[68:55] tries to change that or take that away
[68:56] from us the or infilt it's prison,
[69:00] right? Like if you're trying to
[69:01] undermine or take away our ability to
[69:03] speak freely and you're caught or you're
[69:05] lobbying for it or you're pro it in any
[69:07] other way, it should be a crime and you
[69:10] should be punished. Right? So unless we
[69:11] put those parameters in place, it just
[69:13] seems inevitable that eventually we get
[69:15] to a point
[69:17] where we're back we're back in the same
[69:20] boat we were in 2016 or 2020, I mean. So
[69:23] we're going to see how it plays out. I I
[69:25] don't think we can say we have free
[69:27] speech yet. I'm glad that Elon Musk is
[69:29] doing what he's doing. I'm glad that we
[69:30] are able to have these conversations.
[69:32] And I'm glad I'm we're it's really
[69:35] interesting starting to learn about the
[69:36] history that really happened, right? Not
[69:38] the history we were taught in school.
[69:39] Everything we were taught in school has
[69:40] basically been a lie. Um, you know, like
[69:42] they just found that out that Hitler
[69:44] didn't die and he fled to Argentina and
[69:46] he had three kids. Like, wait, what?
[69:49] What just happened? Like, oh, there's an
[69:51] arc of a covenant. They just found this
[69:53] secret tomb that's two miles under the
[69:55] pyramids and there's this arc of the
[69:57] covenants down there. Okay, so we're
[70:00] really starting to find out all these
[70:01] things because of I think because of
[70:04] platforms like X like they can't silence
[70:07] and censor the narrative in real time
[70:09] anymore. So I don't know. I'm hopeful,
[70:12] but I'm glad we I'm glad we have things
[70:13] like Nostra. That's for sure. Nostra is
[70:15] the exit wealth uh in case ones uh going
[70:20] crazy. And even if if they don't go
[70:22] crazy, I think Nostra has a great
[70:24] future. I love that. Um ask one
[70:27] question. uh to each and every one of my
[70:29] guests and the question is what can we
[70:31] learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[70:34] What can we learn from you besides
[70:36] Bitcoin? Wow, I wasn't ready for that
[70:39] one. You know that I didn't do it uh the
[70:42] first time around. I think it it was
[70:43] something the first time you asked me
[70:44] what kind of question can I what should
[70:46] I ask the next guest or something like
[70:48] that. Yeah, that that's still there but
[70:50] I have a I have an addition to that that
[70:52] now the addition to that. Uh so so say
[70:55] that question again. What can I what can
[70:56] you learn from me besides Bitcoin? I
[70:58] would say that uh you
[71:01] know hard you you can never so if you
[71:05] never say what if
[71:07] today you will never wonder what or
[71:10] sorry if you never say good enough today
[71:12] you'll never have to ask yourself what
[71:14] if tomorrow. So when you think about
[71:16] something like oh I'm going to do that
[71:18] tomorrow. No don't do it tomorrow. If if
[71:20] you have something that needs to be
[71:21] done, just do it and get it done.
[71:23] Because if you get it done today,
[71:25] tomorrow you're never going to go, "Ah,
[71:27] what if I would have did that
[71:28] yesterday?" You know, or what if I would
[71:29] have no just do it and get it done.
[71:32] There's like never underestimate the
[71:35] your ability to to work hard, right? And
[71:37] and you're always able to work harder.
[71:39] So, you know, I've never been
[71:41] disappointed at myself for, you know,
[71:44] spending an extra two hours at at work
[71:46] or or working 2 hours over or working 2
[71:48] hours of overtime. I've never uh been
[71:50] disappointed uh at myself for going to
[71:52] the gym. I've never been disappointed at
[71:54] the gym for staying and doing an extra
[71:56] two or three reps, right? You can always
[71:57] go above and beyond. You can always push
[71:59] yourself to the next limit. So, just
[72:00] never get complacent, never sit still,
[72:02] you know, try to outwork your
[72:04] competition and uh and and just go out
[72:06] of your way to make the world a better
[72:07] place. It's about it. I love that so
[72:10] much. Really cool. And and I can 100%
[72:13] agree to that. Also, um we have still
[72:16] our end team uh where the previous guest
[72:18] is asking a question for the next guest
[72:19] without knowing who the next guest
[72:21] actually is. Uh a completely different
[72:23] question again even though we already
[72:25] covered it a little bit. Um have you
[72:27] ever played around with mining? And I
[72:30] know that you have. So we'll ask why.
[72:34] So I have ever played around with
[72:35] mining. I played around with mining. I
[72:37] can't tell you how many times, Robin.
[72:40] And And the idea was because I thought
[72:42] it was I I when I first understood or or
[72:45] thought I understood what a minor was, I
[72:47] looked at it like an employee. Dude, I'm
[72:50] jealous, man. I need one of those mugs
[72:51] for myself, man. Thing's massive.
[72:55] It's It's a It's a beer uh Stein, so it
[73:00] contains one liter, but I always drink
[73:01] water from it. I I I don't even drink
[73:03] beer myself. That's awesome, man. That's
[73:06] awesome. I got into mining because when
[73:08] he told me he explained what a minor
[73:10] was, he explained that he paid $300 for
[73:12] this piece of equipment. He plugged it
[73:14] into a wall. He spent $50 a month on
[73:17] electricity and it made him hundred. So
[73:20] after 6 months, he paid off this piece
[73:22] of metal and then every month after
[73:24] that, it would make him 50 bucks. Now,
[73:26] he didn't explain the difficulties,
[73:28] levels, and yada yada yada, but I asked,
[73:30] "How long is that is that computer going
[73:31] to be able to run for and do that?" He
[73:33] said, "4our years." I said, "Okay." So,
[73:35] I just started doing the math and I go,
[73:37] "Well, I got one of these and it's
[73:38] making me $50 a day or a month. If I can
[73:41] get two, that's you know what I'm
[73:43] saying? I'm doing the math and I'm like,
[73:44] "Okay, I'm making, you know, at the time
[73:46] probably $200 or $3,000 a month." And
[73:48] I'm just calculating how many of these
[73:50] computers do I need to build so that I
[73:52] don't have to go to work and I can just
[73:53] work on these mining rigs, right? So,
[73:56] that's kind of why I got into mining and
[73:58] why I thought I was going to be this
[73:59] expert miner. And then, uh, sometimes
[74:03] you
[74:04] when you're when you're running
[74:05] businesses and starting businesses, I
[74:07] say you got to get really good at
[74:10] knowing when when you've hit your limit
[74:13] and when you should cut your losses,
[74:14] right? So, like eventually you're doing
[74:17] something and you go like you just
[74:18] realize that no matter how hard you
[74:19] work, no matter how much effort you put
[74:21] into this in your current environment
[74:23] that you're in, right? Like I had to
[74:24] work two jobs, right? I just couldn't
[74:26] dedicate all my time to it. So, I was
[74:28] just strapped and with the resource I
[74:29] had, I knew it was never going to be
[74:30] successful. So sometimes you just have
[74:32] to rip that band-aid off even though
[74:34] you're going to lose 10 20 you know
[74:35] probably $30,000 I lost mining big or I
[74:39] would have if you know I wasn't mining
[74:40] when it was like $2, right? But like
[74:42] just my equipment everything like that I
[74:45] you know at one point I was probably at
[74:46] a $30,000 loss because I was holding on
[74:49] to this coin that was you know worth
[74:51] dollars. Now it's you know in reality I
[74:54] was mining like $7,000 a day or $12,000
[74:57] a day. Uh you know and ETH at $2.64 64.
[75:00] I was mining three and a half coins a
[75:02] day. I was mining with all my computers
[75:03] at at the at the at its peak closer to
[75:05] six. So, I mean, that's a lot would have
[75:08] been, but at the time, even when I got
[75:09] done mining and I had,000 coins of of
[75:11] Ethereum at $10, it's 10,000, right? And
[75:14] I'm still out this this massive amount
[75:17] of money that I put. And not even just
[75:19] that, like I converted my I I took my
[75:22] Yeah, I got um Yeah, long story short,
[75:25] my dad came over, we we converted a a
[75:27] master walk-in closet into a mining
[75:29] farm. So, like we cut a big hole in my
[75:31] door and put a intake fan. Then we went
[75:34] and got one of those giant, if you ever
[75:35] been to like a like a beach. They have
[75:37] those giant outhouses with those massive
[75:39] fans, those exhaust fans to stink out
[75:42] all the bathrooms in a in a beach. And I
[75:44] put one of those in the ceiling in my
[75:46] roof in my raptors, in my closet. We
[75:48] vented it out to the bathroom exhaust
[75:50] port. So, I had this huge mining
[75:52] operation. I mean, I put a lot of money
[75:53] into it. And I just no matter how hard I
[75:55] tried, I could not keep those dang
[75:57] things running. It's a graphics card, it
[75:59] was a cord, it was this, it was that, it
[76:00] was a riser. And just finally just never
[76:04] being able to keep my rigs running for
[76:06] longer than like a week or 3 weeks or,
[76:09] you know, I just said, you know what? I
[76:11] realized that if I would have just taken
[76:12] that money and I would have just bought
[76:15] the coin and I would have held the coin
[76:17] with the amount of money that I put into
[76:19] the mining equipment, if I would have
[76:20] just bought the asset and held the
[76:22] asset, I would have been like 100,000
[76:24] times richer. And I still didn't learn
[76:26] my lesson. And I tried to do it again in
[76:28] 2017 or 2018. Same same scenario, same
[76:32] thing. And now I just realized like,
[76:34] dude, don't you just sometimes you're
[76:36] just not built for something and I'm not
[76:37] built for mine. And so I'm just a humble
[76:39] Bitcoiner and I just buy and stack
[76:41] Bitcoin. It's easier for me to mine fiat
[76:42] is what I should say. I've learned that
[76:44] I can go out and I can mine fiat by
[76:46] working and doing what I do outside of
[76:48] the Bitcoin world easier than I can from
[76:51] mining and doing stuff inside the
[76:52] Bitcoin world. Very true. And I think
[76:55] mining is an interesting one because you
[76:58] can have a Bitex, but it's more like a
[77:00] lottery and not a business. Uh and and
[77:02] stuff like that. Uh and sorry, they're
[77:06] running right next to me.
[77:07] [Music]
[77:08] So maybe I am still mining a little bit,
[77:09] but they're just bites. All right. Yeah,
[77:12] it's it's it's more lottery. Yeah,
[77:14] that's exactly what it is. I'm solo
[77:16] mining. So, but but I think the I I
[77:20] never calculated it's probably better
[77:21] odds than the actual lottery. I would I
[77:24] would bet I think so. I don't play the
[77:25] lottery and I got these things running.
[77:27] So,
[77:28] really cool. Um before I let you go,
[77:30] where can people find you, ask you
[77:31] questions, and also uh see more of your
[77:33] documentaries and stuff like that? Yeah,
[77:35] thank you. Uh you mainly I'm on X that's
[77:38] the biggest platform Ryan Matamedia but
[77:40] I also have an X crypto account which is
[77:43] @shotssbymata. I I don't post over there
[77:45] very often but anytime I do an interview
[77:47] with somebody cryptoreated all my crypto
[77:49] tutorials I went down to El Salvador and
[77:51] did a bunch of tutorials on all the all
[77:53] the equipment all the Bitcoin hardware
[77:54] wallets and stuff like that. They're all
[77:56] over on my uh on my cryptox and as well
[77:58] on my YouTube which is Ryan Mata. That's
[78:01] where I put out some of my crypto and my
[78:03] Bitcoin stuff. And then everything else
[78:05] you'll find me on Rumble at Ryan Meta.
[78:07] Really cool. Thank you so much for being
[78:09] on. Also, thank you so much for everyone
[78:10] that is watching and listening, for
[78:12] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[78:14] back tomorrow with another episode.
[78:15] Bye-bye.
