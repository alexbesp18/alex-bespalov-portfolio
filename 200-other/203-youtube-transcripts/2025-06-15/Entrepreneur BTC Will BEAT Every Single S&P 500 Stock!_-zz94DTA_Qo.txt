[00:00] Bitcoin removes the imperfections of
[00:03] humanity from money micro strategy has
[00:06] outperformed every single S&P 500
[00:08] company since 2020 and I think that
[00:11] really goes to show you what's the power
[00:13] of Bitcoin Bitcoin will reset the hurdle
[00:15] rate and where the hurdle rate in our
[00:17] existing system is arguably just the
[00:19] melting ice cube of Fiat money that's
[00:22] where you get a lot of malinvestment
[00:24] imagine if we took all the bright mines
[00:25] and Engineers that are in crypto right
[00:27] now and had them working on bitcoin how
[00:29] much more powerful would the lightning
[00:30] Network be or the ark protocol be the
[00:33] idea of a company having their treasury
[00:35] in Bitcoin will become a very strong
[00:39] competitive Advantage for them and I
[00:40] would not be surprised if there are
[00:42] micro strategy customers where the CEOs
[00:45] of those companies that purchased micro
[00:47] strategy software did it simply because
[00:49] they are bitcoiners it's one of those
[00:51] things that is underappreciated I think
[00:53] it's going to be way bigger than say the
[00:54] ETFs and you know the impacts that that
[00:57] have had on bitcoin new fed targets no
[00:59] longer % I think it's 3% they just never
[01:01] said it they probably never will it
[01:03] separates money not just from state but
[01:05] it separates money from
[01:10] Humanity you have quit a long uh Tech
[01:13] Career uh to do a full-time congration
[01:17] you have done something with AI you've
[01:18] done something with businesses um how do
[01:22] you think uh that Bitcoin will impact
[01:25] businesses startup Venture Capital all
[01:27] all those things that you maybe also
[01:29] lift through uh and how will this change
[01:32] when when Bitcoin is actually a full
[01:34] thing not just like a small asset that
[01:36] some some weirdos like us have but like
[01:39] uh where all the people have Bitcoin and
[01:41] it's a kind of a Bitcoin World wow
[01:43] that's a that's a big question I feel
[01:45] like we can do the whole podcast on this
[01:47] but great first question um yeah so
[01:50] maybe I'll start with just a little bit
[01:51] of my background for people that don't
[01:53] know me so I I spent about 10 years of
[01:55] my career in B2B Tech mostly startups so
[01:58] the largest company I ever worked that
[02:00] was 200 people so I'm not talking like
[02:02] Facebook Salesforce kind of tech I'm
[02:05] talking really small startups most of
[02:07] them were in Ai and there were a couple
[02:10] things I took away from that experience
[02:12] and by the way I quit as you mentioned
[02:14] the B2B Tech world in the past year and
[02:17] I'm going all in on bitcoin all in on
[02:19] content creation because I want to
[02:21] support this new world this parallel
[02:23] system that we're building I'm sure
[02:25] we'll we'll dive into that more um but
[02:27] to answer a question like where do I see
[02:29] Bitcoin and kind of the world of tech
[02:32] coinciding I'd say that the first thing
[02:36] that notice I noticed about the tech
[02:40] world is that a lot of it is how do I
[02:43] say this politely a lot of it is kind of
[02:45] a house of cards like there's a there's
[02:47] a very close correl between B2B Tech
[02:51] world and venture capital and the Fiat
[02:54] money system that we learn about as we
[02:56] go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and I'm
[02:58] not surprised that my urge to leave the
[03:01] B2B Tech world really started to
[03:03] strengthen when I discovered Bitcoin so
[03:05] I discovered Bitcoin around 2020 I
[03:08] bought my first Bitcoin in 2016 but I
[03:11] quite honestly didn't understand it at
[03:12] the time I just bought some and had it
[03:14] on coinbase but 2020 was when you know
[03:17] the world shut down know be I'll leave
[03:19] it at that so you know get canceled by
[03:21] YouTube um but I just remember thinking
[03:24] how is it possible that we're getting
[03:27] all these checks in the mail like
[03:28] where's this money coming from and it
[03:31] was that question that tipped me into
[03:33] the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole where I learned
[03:35] about Central Banking I learned about
[03:37] quantitative easing I learned it about
[03:39] inflation and you know to summarize it
[03:43] at least in my view I realized that a
[03:45] lot of it is kind of made up in a sense
[03:48] it's kind of fictional and the system
[03:51] really needs to just keep chugging along
[03:54] in order to survive and I I phrase it in
[03:58] that way it's obviously an over
[03:59] simplification but that's very similar
[04:01] to I think how a lot of technology
[04:04] companies work unfortunately so um you
[04:08] know if you kind of go back in time when
[04:10] I started my career I'm 30 years old so
[04:11] I started my career in 2015 that's when
[04:14] I joined the first startup um money was
[04:17] cheap money has always been cheap for my
[04:19] career so really unless you're in your
[04:22] 40s you know Tech has always been you
[04:25] know pretty much a great place to be you
[04:28] know zero interest rate money is cheap
[04:31] there's tons of funding and that's all
[04:33] well and good until funding stops and I
[04:36] think that's where we start started to
[04:38] see happen in
[04:39] 2021 where 2020 obviously the events of
[04:42] 2020 occurred but then inflation started
[04:45] to Peak up rates started to increase
[04:47] more into 2022 I suppose and me being in
[04:51] Tech particularly by the way I was in
[04:53] the sales world so I was selling
[04:55] software to large Enterprises large
[04:58] companies budgets start Ed freezing
[05:00] people were doing layoffs like Tech went
[05:03] from easy mode to Hard Mode within the
[05:06] space of a year and that's really where
[05:08] I start to see okay everything I learned
[05:11] about Bitcoin from reading safe's book
[05:13] and you know watching breed L's podcast
[05:15] and all this stuff like this also
[05:17] applies to my work like my career is
[05:20] very much dependent on the state of
[05:24] interest rates and the Fiat system and
[05:28] I'm seeing my friends get let go at
[05:31] companies and the industry is going down
[05:33] I'm not hitting my sales numbers the our
[05:36] lives in Tech startups completely
[05:39] shifted and if anybody's watching this
[05:40] that worked in a tech startup in 2022
[05:44] 2023 they know exactly what I'm talking
[05:46] about and I think that's you hopefully
[05:49] that answer your question kind of in a
[05:51] roundabout way but it's it all comes
[05:53] back to the money and so I'm hopeful
[05:56] that you know Bitcoin is you know I
[05:59] don't want to say it's the shot but I
[06:02] think it's by far the best shot we have
[06:04] at changing the system that we all live
[06:07] and breathe
[06:08] in it's interesting when I think about
[06:11] uh especially also this the startup
[06:13] world as you mentioned it um a lot of
[06:16] things live from the Venture Capital
[06:18] world and cheap credits and it's
[06:21] interesting like they are if you're a
[06:24] person with a lot of net worth you are
[06:26] incentivized to spend your net worth on
[06:29] uh gold Bitcoin startups uh and all
[06:32] those things because the dollar or any
[06:35] other currency is losing rapidly value
[06:37] what if this isn't the case what if like
[06:39] Bitcoin is the main currency uh and you
[06:42] can like safely put it in there and you
[06:44] know your purchasing power will go up
[06:46] like two three% every year you don't
[06:48] have to do anything for that then all of
[06:50] the sudden Bitcoin becomes the hurdle
[06:52] rate and the incentive to invest in
[06:55] Risky startups is is slow or or less uh
[06:59] incentive so you only invest in like
[07:01] really hyper um Quality startups and
[07:04] things like you really want to get
[07:06] behind uh so the the overall Capital
[07:10] might decrease for for startups uh but
[07:13] the the quality might increase is uh
[07:17] could could that slow down maybe even
[07:19] like Innovation to a certain extent or
[07:21] will that maybe enhance uh uh Innovation
[07:25] because then we have more solid Capital
[07:28] it's it's something that I'm not sure
[07:30] yet like it's it's a hard topic to be
[07:32] honest for me it is and it's it's
[07:34] interesting because the topic obviously
[07:35] I care very deeply about because you
[07:39] know like you said you don't want to
[07:40] stifle Innovation right Innovation is of
[07:42] course very very powerful it's you know
[07:45] work speaking here on a software using
[07:48] Hardware that's all been invented within
[07:50] the past like 10 20 years and it's
[07:51] amazing like I'm in sole South Korea by
[07:53] the way um so like chatting with you
[07:56] from across the world is like a miracle
[07:58] in many senses and a lot that is only
[08:00] possible when you have Capital
[08:02] allocators that take risks but I think
[08:05] the way you put it is actually perfect
[08:07] Robin like Bitcoin will reset the hurdle
[08:09] rate and where the hurdle rate in our
[08:12] existing system is arguably you know
[08:15] just the melting ice cube of Fiat money
[08:17] like we're just trying to get rid of it
[08:19] as quickly as possible that's where you
[08:22] get a lot of malinvestment you have you
[08:24] know obviously the whole crypto pones
[08:26] and that whole ecosystem you know pones
[08:29] at work maybe just I like to call them
[08:32] Solutions looking for problems at best
[08:35] um but then you also have you know
[08:38] things like we work and again in the B2B
[08:40] Tech space um you know there's a there's
[08:42] a very famous Venture Capital firm
[08:44] called Ty Global and they invested in
[08:47] one of the startups I was at so I need
[08:48] to be careful I don't want to you know
[08:49] talk poorly of them um they're they're
[08:52] legendary investors they they you know
[08:54] have very seasoned careers but they were
[08:56] very notorious in the B2B Tech space in
[08:59] 2020 and 2021 to basically write a check
[09:02] to any Tech startup that had a pulse
[09:05] they would just throw money at these
[09:06] startups and they would outbid other
[09:08] Venture Capital firms because they their
[09:11] thesis was just we need to invest as
[09:13] much money as possible and it's that
[09:17] it's that attitude that leads to obvious
[09:20] Mal investment and you know on one hand
[09:23] I guess to maybe answer your question a
[09:25] different way because I've thought about
[09:26] this is like is that a would that be a
[09:27] bad thing if Global and other Venture
[09:30] Capital firms weren't able to do that
[09:33] right because that money flows into tech
[09:35] companies and then people get jobs and
[09:37] people work on problems and some of them
[09:39] fail and then they move
[09:41] on the the flip side of that argument is
[09:45] what else could those people have worked
[09:46] on like all those people that were
[09:49] working at these Tech startups that
[09:50] ultimately collapsed could they have
[09:52] worked on something that was more
[09:54] productive to s that didn't collapse
[09:56] imagine if we took all the bright mines
[09:58] and Engineers that are in crypto right
[10:00] now and have them working on bitcoin how
[10:02] much more powerful would the lightning
[10:04] Network be or the arc you know protocol
[10:06] be or liquid and that's I think the
[10:09] framing that I'm at least convinced of
[10:12] that you know risk- taking is good but
[10:16] you can also allocate risk in the wrong
[10:17] places and that can lead to negative
[10:21] outcomes I love also the analogy with
[10:23] the hammer I don't I forgot which guest
[10:25] of my podcast said it uh but it's
[10:27] basically like a people want to put a
[10:30] blockchain and crypto everywhere now uh
[10:33] I mean the trend is a little slowing
[10:35] down I feel like it's not that crazy as
[10:37] as it was uh especially in in the 2017
[10:41] area and also 2021 it was pretty pretty
[10:45] half uh pretty massive but they like
[10:48] going around with a hammer which is the
[10:50] blockchain and their nail is like uh
[10:52] Bitcoin but they're also trying to
[10:54] hammer everything else down and they're
[10:55] like just like let's let's go in the
[10:57] city and let's find nails to like put
[10:59] something in the ground so it's it's an
[11:01] interesting comparison because I feel
[11:03] like blockchain is only really good for
[11:05] for Bitcoin like that that's the sole
[11:07] purpose of it uh and and the rest is
[11:10] like yeah it's an inefficient way to to
[11:12] save data you can do that uh but there
[11:15] is more efficient ways to to do that but
[11:18] it just wanted to to highlight that and
[11:20] I like a lot that you have in your bio
[11:23] written uh I'm in Bitcoin and then not
[11:26] crypto so like that that is really
[11:29] an extremely important distinction for
[11:32] me that this alone shows that like oh
[11:34] yeah he he understands Bitcoin deeper
[11:37] than just like oh yeah it could
[11:39] revolutionize Finance no no like he
[11:41] actually did some research he did some
[11:43] digging because most people that have
[11:45] just surface level is like yeah like I I
[11:48] like crypto I like blockchain like you
[11:51] you don't have no clue what you're
[11:53] talking about but that's nailed it I I
[11:56] my opinion it's the same Robin like one
[11:58] of my favorite or like just I always
[12:00] laugh when I chat with people that maybe
[12:02] aren't interested in Bitcoin yet or
[12:04] they're kind of new to the space but
[12:05] they'll say something along the lines of
[12:08] oh I'm not really into Bitcoin but I I'm
[12:10] really passionate about blockchain
[12:12] technology I think it's really powerful
[12:14] that tells me that they don't understand
[12:15] blockchain and they don't understand
[12:17] Bitcoin and I think it's just you know
[12:19] over time you know people will hopefully
[12:22] learn but I think you bring up another
[12:24] you know interesting point that like I
[12:27] mean that's why I think content creators
[12:28] like yourself and all the various
[12:30] podcasts that we have in this space why
[12:31] it's so important because yes Bitcoin
[12:34] exists and it could pretty much be
[12:37] perfect right you know sa for some bugs
[12:39] and updates that need to be done over
[12:41] time just maintain it but that's another
[12:44] lesson I learned the hard way in the
[12:46] tech startup world is you know this this
[12:49] phrase of build it and they will come is
[12:52] a complete lie like you could have the
[12:54] best product and if you don't sell it if
[12:57] you don't distribute it if you don't
[12:59] edate people about it people aren't
[13:01] going to come and there's stories of
[13:03] this if you look at history I think
[13:05] probably the most famous one for
[13:06] Millennials and you know maybe you know
[13:08] gen Gen X would be VHS and betamax where
[13:13] betamax was a superior technology but
[13:16] vhs1 because it just had much better
[13:18] distribution and probably people like my
[13:21] age and younger don't even know what
[13:22] betamax was or never used one because I
[13:25] don't know what is I don't I never used
[13:28] one either but I just I heard the the
[13:30] story of it which was it was a better
[13:32] product by you know most metrics but it
[13:36] failed because VHS I always I always
[13:39] compareed with Blu-ray do you remember
[13:41] Blu-ray Blu-ray yeah it's a another
[13:43] great example yeah yeah everyone is like
[13:47] that's the future and then yeah we have
[13:49] everything digital we don't need those
[13:52] CDs anymore but it brings up an
[13:54] interesting point why did you then
[13:56] decide to go fulltime in content
[13:58] creation and Bitcoin and and also
[14:00] immersed in the community yeah that's a
[14:02] great question thanks for for segling us
[14:04] there so this maybe takes us out a bit
[14:06] out of the Bitcoin space so just a bit
[14:08] about my personal life so um I met my
[14:12] wife in 2020 we actually met out of one
[14:14] of the startups we were working at that
[14:16] start up shut down so it's kind of funny
[14:18] the co-founders often comment to us that
[14:20] we are the the Phoenix that Rose From
[14:23] the Ashes of that that startup but
[14:25] anyways we met um she is Korean and but
[14:29] we were you know met in Canada we were
[14:31] working in Canada and um again don't
[14:34] want to talk too much about politics or
[14:37] you know the events of 2020 but Canada
[14:38] was not a great place to be for a few
[14:41] years and I had lived and was born in
[14:44] Canada lived there my whole life and I
[14:46] was like you know what I don't want to
[14:47] grow old here and die and never have
[14:49] lived anywhere else and simultaneously
[14:51] my wife girlfriend at the time wanted to
[14:54] live closer to family so long story
[14:56] short we moved to Korea and so reason I
[14:59] bring this up might sound irrelevant to
[15:02] you know the text story but um part of
[15:05] that is that she's a full-time content
[15:06] creator even though we met in Tech she
[15:09] you know loved creating content on the
[15:10] side she loves fashion and skin care and
[15:13] you know things that women love and she
[15:15] was posting content and when we moved to
[15:17] Korea I said to her you know you seem to
[15:19] enjoy this side hustle of yours way more
[15:22] than you enjoy sales enablement and
[15:25] marketing operations and all this Tech
[15:28] stuff you know working spreadsheets why
[15:30] don't you try doing this fulltime
[15:32] pretend it's your job don't worry too
[15:34] too much about money I'll keep working
[15:35] for my startup and so that's another
[15:37] interesting story there I actually
[15:38] worked from Korea 10 pm to 6:00 a.m for
[15:43] close to a year about 10 months just
[15:45] like like a vampire um remotely because
[15:48] that was possible you know with
[15:50] technology but anyways I did that while
[15:52] she was kind of focusing on content
[15:54] creation fulltime and I think it was
[15:56] within like 6 to n months she was making
[16:00] more doing content creation something
[16:02] that she loved doing had way more
[16:04] freedom with her her schedule and what
[16:08] she just enjoyed doing she was making
[16:11] more doing content creation than she
[16:12] ever did in her Tech Career and that one
[16:15] obviously I was proud for you know my
[16:17] partner to do that but that was like a
[16:19] white bulb moment for me where I thought
[16:22] wow content creation can be a business
[16:26] like it's not just where I think
[16:27] especially like Millennials like myself
[16:29] I think maybe we we see you know YouTube
[16:31] or podcasting as kind of more of a hobby
[16:34] or at least I did for a long time I
[16:35] enjoyed them I love consuming them but I
[16:38] didn't really think that it was possible
[16:40] to make that a business and turn that
[16:42] into a living and when I saw that again
[16:46] simultaneously while I was getting more
[16:48] and more passionate about Bitcoin and
[16:50] this whole new world I thought you know
[16:52] what this is this is what I want to do
[16:55] and it's funny that you mentioned that
[16:56] you're you want to do this podcast for
[16:59] 10 years because that's exactly what I
[17:00] said to myself I could show you a note
[17:02] on my phone where I wrote in 10 years I
[17:05] want X Y and Z for my content creation
[17:07] and you know we talk about low time
[17:10] preference and all those you know things
[17:12] how Bitcoin changes us and transforms us
[17:15] but you know that's kind of the the long
[17:17] story short was uh my wife was a content
[17:19] creator that kind of woke me up to the
[17:22] possibilities and I decid to follow in
[17:24] her
[17:25] footsteps and that's so fun I had to had
[17:29] to smile because my I keep my girlfriend
[17:32] a secret for now but she also does skin
[17:35] care and fashion and she also does
[17:36] conentration oh I love it there you
[17:40] go maybe we have at some point for
[17:44] sure H really interesting uh that's
[17:47] that's just for your context why why I
[17:50] smiled when you said that she makes skin
[17:51] not because I I think it's fun it's just
[17:54] because my my girl also does the same
[17:56] thing amazing I love it really cool uh
[17:59] um with with Bitcoin um it's it's it's
[18:02] interesting B first of all like even
[18:05] outside of Bitcoin content creation is
[18:07] actually one of the fastest growing
[18:09] markets when you look at how many people
[18:11] are full-time in content creation how
[18:13] much money is in content creation um yes
[18:17] it is like the top few uh people make
[18:20] like almost all of the money so most
[18:22] people who do content creation do it as
[18:25] a hobby do it as something on the side
[18:27] and some people don't even want to do it
[18:29] full-time some people have just like a
[18:31] once in a month podcast they want to do
[18:34] uh because they really like to have this
[18:36] once in a month conversation and they
[18:38] don't even have any intention to
[18:40] monetize it and I think there is this
[18:42] mindset coming from that it's not a
[18:44] business it's like I don't know some
[18:46] people like to pro beer in their garages
[18:49] like every once in a while and they they
[18:51] don't want to make a business out of
[18:52] there but they're really big uh uh be
[18:54] breing businesses like there's a lot of
[18:56] examples of that with content creat
[18:59] because it's like when are you a content
[19:01] creator because if you tweet one time
[19:03] like oh yeah you create a Content that's
[19:05] available like then you're content
[19:07] creator like almost everyone is then a
[19:08] content creator because almost everyone
[19:11] made the Instagram Story Once in their
[19:13] life uh so that's kind of like uh I
[19:16] think it's a weird thing because every
[19:19] there are like three billion conent
[19:21] graders out there when you see it like
[19:23] that um very really cool um what is um I
[19:27] think you're because you have those
[19:29] goals with 10 years because you have
[19:31] that that mindset I guess you have an an
[19:34] answer for that what is the impact that
[19:37] you hope to have in the Bitcoin
[19:38] Community or or like what is the the
[19:40] drive to like uh why Bitcoin and and
[19:44] those those things why is that the big
[19:46] passion of yours yeah it's it's a great
[19:49] question I think I listened to the
[19:51] episode you had with Julian figuroa on
[19:54] from kinetic finance a great content
[19:57] creator that I admire and love his work
[19:59] and he said something um that I
[20:02] resonated with me which was basically
[20:04] like I want to get as many of my friends
[20:06] and family the people that I care about
[20:09] on board right if if if you know if I
[20:11] have a life boat obviously I want to I
[20:13] want to share it with as many people as
[20:15] I can and so content creation to me is
[20:18] kind of an extension of that now I think
[20:20] I might be taking a bit of a unique
[20:22] approach maybe not unique I don't want
[20:23] to give myself too much credit but at
[20:25] least you know different from say the
[20:26] podcast you're producing or what other
[20:29] great content creators like Julian or
[20:31] Bram or um other kind of Bitcoin focused
[20:35] podcasts are doing which was I kind of
[20:37] thought to myself you know what there's
[20:39] a lot of great Bitcoin podcasts that I
[20:41] love you know I love listening to what
[20:43] is Bitcoin now it's Mr obnoxious I love
[20:45] listening to what is money which is you
[20:47] know Robert breed show um safe's podcast
[20:51] but before I was in Bitcoin I never
[20:55] really was interested in Bitcoin and so
[20:58] my goal like I named my YouTube channel
[21:00] wealth potion for for instance it
[21:01] doesn't really directly reference
[21:04] Bitcoin because I want to create content
[21:07] that's kind of I I kind of want to
[21:10] orange pill people with a kind of Sly
[21:13] roundabout way if you will um so if I
[21:16] think back to my own orange pill Journey
[21:18] again going back to 2020 it was learning
[21:20] about quantitative easing and inflation
[21:23] and interest rates and these kind of
[21:25] somewhat boring topics um but I was just
[21:29] really interested in learning about
[21:30] because it just didn't make sense to me
[21:32] and I just wanted to dive into it and
[21:35] then by accident almost I got to bitcoin
[21:38] and so I'm not straying away from
[21:41] creating Bitcoin content like one of my
[21:43] better performing videos right now is
[21:45] about Bitcoin and why it's different
[21:46] from crypto um but I wanted to kind of
[21:52] have Bitcoin more in the back seat and
[21:54] let people arrive at that answer
[21:56] themselves if that makes sense and maybe
[21:58] I'll share another quick kind of
[21:59] anecdote from my time in um in Tech
[22:02] startups so as I mentioned like eight of
[22:04] those 10 years I was in sales and I
[22:07] think sales is one of those
[22:10] interesting kind of professions where I
[22:13] think it has uh a kind of surface level
[22:17] uh definition very similar to bitcoin
[22:19] right you mention Bitcoin to someone
[22:20] they immediately get some words pop up
[22:22] in their head like crypto or blockchain
[22:24] and when you mention sales I mean
[22:25] Studies have actually been done on this
[22:27] that people think of use car salesmen
[22:29] and telemarketers and Sleazy and smarmy
[22:32] and these kind of negative words and one
[22:34] of the first things I learned in sales
[22:36] is that like a professional
[22:38] salesperson they're not really trying to
[22:42] convince anybody of anything they're
[22:44] actually asking a lot of questions to
[22:47] get the client or the buyer to come to
[22:50] that conclusion themselves it's very
[22:52] similar to the movie Inception if you've
[22:54] watched that movie where you need to
[22:56] plant the idea deep enough
[22:59] where they feel like they came up with a
[23:01] solution themselves you're just asking
[23:02] them questions about their problem
[23:04] basically right like if I'm selling at
[23:06] one point I was selling event management
[23:08] software so I would ask you know how are
[23:09] you managing your events today oh you're
[23:11] using paper and pencil well have you had
[23:14] any problems with that what have you
[23:15] tried to do to solve that how much time
[23:17] are you spending on that how much you
[23:19] think that's costing you and I'm just
[23:20] asking a series of open-ended questions
[23:22] to get them to realize that there's
[23:25] something wrong I'm not coming to them
[23:27] and saying hey like you need to use our
[23:30] app because it's way better than pen and
[23:31] paper you know it's it's so taking that
[23:34] mindset I thought huh maybe I can kind
[23:36] of take some of that learning that I had
[23:38] from the tech startup world and apply
[23:40] that kind of method I suppose of
[23:43] communication to bitcoin and so right
[23:45] now I've been really just focusing on
[23:47] content around these kind of you know
[23:48] somewhat boring but I think important
[23:51] economic topics like inflation and
[23:53] Central Banking and then hopefully
[23:55] through that people will see the hints
[23:57] that I'm dropping you know like I use
[23:59] the Bitcoin logo Orange in my logo you
[24:02] know so people know hey okay there's
[24:04] some there's some Bitcoin here but it's
[24:05] not all of the Bitcoin i i l that a lot
[24:09] this was by the way also like one of my
[24:10] reasons why I named it Robin sire and
[24:14] not anything with Bitcoin it started the
[24:16] first I think four episodes where like
[24:18] the Bitcoin path uh but I was like ah I
[24:21] don't want that uh and it gives me the
[24:24] opportunity to not do rebrandings
[24:26] because I see as what bit did he is also
[24:29] now doing a big rebranding that's always
[24:31] like a hard thing to do uh I see some
[24:33] other Bitcoin podcasts like I think the
[24:36] progressive Bitcoin podcast I think
[24:38] they're planning a rening soon I saw
[24:40] something on Twitter I might be wrong on
[24:42] that and
[24:45] podcast oh yeah and there are some other
[24:48] um yeah some other Bitcoin podcast and
[24:51] some other brands that I see like oh
[24:53] they're they're doing a rebranding
[24:54] they're doing rebranding or they had
[24:55] done a rebranding even Matthew GR
[24:58] Bitcoin University was before the trader
[25:01] universities right there have been
[25:03] always like rebrandings in Brands and
[25:04] I'm like I don't want to do rebranding
[25:07] like I will always call myself Robin S
[25:10] so like that's that's probably really
[25:12] consistent with me and if if it's not
[25:15] obviously from the first uh moment they
[25:17] see that it's not Bitcoin yeah then then
[25:19] it's not that obvious but we will get to
[25:21] it one thing that I'm also I'm
[25:23] interested uh what you said uh just
[25:26] really briefly before that you move
[25:28] moved to South Korea and you left Canada
[25:31] you mentioned a little bit your your why
[25:33] there but did this change your your view
[25:36] in any ways because I think South Korea
[25:38] could can be uh I've never been to
[25:41] Canada never been to South Korea so I
[25:43] cannot really say but they probably are
[25:45] quite uh different in the culture uh did
[25:48] this change your view on on bitcoin on
[25:50] wealth on on
[25:51] business maybe indirectly I think it
[25:53] changed my view on a lot of other things
[25:55] in life that maybe indirectly changed my
[25:59] views on money and wealth I don't think
[26:01] my views on bitcoin changed I'm I'm
[26:03] still you know irresponsibly long there
[26:06] but um I I would say that you know a
[26:09] couple things maybe I'll comment on it
[26:11] one I was lucky that even though I lived
[26:14] my first 30 years of my life in Canada I
[26:17] did do an exchange semester in Poland
[26:20] and I did one work internship in
[26:22] Malaysia so I had spent you know two
[26:24] three months abroad and that kind of
[26:26] gave me that little seed in the back of
[26:27] my head like hey traveling is pretty
[26:30] cool and I don't just mean traveling to
[26:32] like go to a resort I mean to like live
[26:34] somewhere else like that concept was
[26:35] really attractive to me so um I guess
[26:39] one takeaway I'd share there if there's
[26:40] any young people listening to this if
[26:41] you're in high school University College
[26:45] like if you have an opportunity to
[26:46] travel I would take it um how has it
[26:50] changed my view though I think oh man
[26:52] like the cultures to your point is like
[26:54] they're vastly different so I'll try to
[26:57] oversimplify here here and be generous
[26:59] because again I love Canada it has a
[27:00] special place in my heart you know I I
[27:02] mean have my family's there my friends
[27:05] are there but Canada is a very um it's a
[27:09] very sheltered place and I think a lot
[27:11] of this has to do with its history I
[27:13] mean I'm half Vietnamese my my mom and
[27:15] her Vietnamese family all escaped the
[27:17] Vietnam War and went to Canada because
[27:19] Canada was considered a very safe place
[27:20] it was under Pierre Trudeau which is
[27:22] Justin Trudeau's father um who you know
[27:25] welcomed a lot of refugees during the
[27:27] the Vietnam War so I'm very thankful to
[27:29] Canada obviously I wouldn't be alive um
[27:32] but because of that Canada has become
[27:34] very very comfortable I'd say that's the
[27:36] biggest difference say between Canada
[27:38] and the United States is United States
[27:40] has this you know this um competitive
[27:43] nature to it like they want to win they
[27:45] want to be number one you know whether
[27:47] you agree with that or not like that's
[27:49] where a lot of people go to do business
[27:51] you know there's not a lot of Canadian
[27:53] startups that are very successful by the
[27:55] way right a lot of talent goes from
[27:57] Canada to the United States
[27:58] as an example and so just to give some
[28:02] anecdotes around Canada being a very
[28:03] comfortable place whereas Korea South
[28:06] Korea is very different if anyone's been
[28:08] to South Korea I mean one it's very
[28:10] Korean it's very homogeneous and I
[28:12] actually I think there's a lot of
[28:13] benefits that I don't say that in an
[28:15] insult at all and like I am very
[28:18] grateful and blessed that I'm in the
[28:20] country at all uh because it's
[28:24] incredibly safe it's incredibly clean um
[28:27] the standard of living and like the cost
[28:28] of living is quite low the standard of
[28:30] living is quite High um it has its
[28:32] challenges the birth rate here is the
[28:34] lowest in the world and the biggest
[28:36] reason for that is you guessed it cost
[28:39] of living and you know housing is
[28:41] expensive so a lot of young people don't
[28:43] feel like they are ready financially to
[28:45] own a home which again goes to your
[28:47] question around Bitcoin like I am so
[28:49] confident that Bitcoin is the solution
[28:51] to that um now one other side to this
[28:55] where South Korea is different is
[28:58] that um how do I put this it's it's a
[29:01] collectivist country and I think that
[29:04] sometimes can sound like a bad word to
[29:06] westerners like myself like I grew up in
[29:08] Canada so I was very much of like I want
[29:10] my individual rights and like
[29:12] collectivism is bad and certainly
[29:15] there's dangers to it I mean China is
[29:16] one example where it's you know your
[29:19] freedom of speech is certainly not
[29:20] nearly as protected there but South
[29:22] Korea is a democratic country there are
[29:24] you know two main parties and you know I
[29:27] can go out on the street
[29:28] it's it's 8m right now but if I were to
[29:30] go out on the street tomor during the
[29:32] day and I'm CH with someone about
[29:34] politics I could speak my opinion openly
[29:37] either criticizing or praising the party
[29:40] that's in power and no one no one would
[29:42] care and ironically even though a lot of
[29:45] westerners think of Asia as being less
[29:49] freedom of speech largely because of
[29:50] China I couldn't do that in Canada my
[29:52] political views in Canada were not
[29:54] welcome I would probably have been fired
[29:55] from all three of those startups if I
[29:57] were to be completely honest with my
[30:00] political views and just think about
[30:02] what was happening in my country and
[30:05] so I I don't know where I'm going with
[30:08] this but I think needless to say it was
[30:10] a huge culture shock to see how
[30:12] different the world is just from you
[30:14] know picking myself out out of the
[30:17] country that I was born and raised in
[30:19] and then dropping myself in a new
[30:20] country and I I think often about this
[30:23] analogy uh it's it's more of a joke but
[30:26] it's relevant here it's you know there's
[30:28] two fish and they're swimming and uh one
[30:30] fish goes to the other fish and says hey
[30:32] the the water's warm today isn't it and
[30:34] the other fish goes what's water and I
[30:37] think it's a perfect analogy for people
[30:38] that are just like I know so many
[30:40] Canadians that love Canada think Canada
[30:42] is the best place in the world but they
[30:44] have never lived anywhere else and if
[30:46] they've traveled they've like gone to an
[30:48] all-inclusive resort in the Dominican
[30:50] Republic and that's traveled to them and
[30:53] I just think the world is such a diverse
[30:55] and beautiful place that um
[30:58] I didn't want that for my life I don't
[31:00] want that for my kids and um yeah it's
[31:03] been a it's been an adventure so far if
[31:06] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:08] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:10] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:13] important step is to keep their Bitcoin
[31:16] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:19] personal recommendation for Hardware
[31:20] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[31:23] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[31:25] gift for a friend who has still the
[31:28] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[31:31] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[31:34] checkout visit bitbox Swiss robobin to
[31:38] get your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:41] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:43] individual you have to have the most
[31:46] secure self custody setup you have to
[31:48] secure your own devices you have to
[31:51] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:54] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:56] where you live you even want to have a
[31:59] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:02] in case something goes really really
[32:03] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:05] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:08] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:11] way.com SLP Partners Robin you even get
[32:15] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[32:18] you can level up your sovereignty and
[32:21] last but not least I have something
[32:23] completely new for you guys I partnered
[32:26] up with coin gante this is the most
[32:29] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:32] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:35] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:38] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[32:41] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:44] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:47] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:50] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:53] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:57] watch collection you have the date of
[32:59] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:02] there and of course also the block
[33:04] height and which EPO we are currently in
[33:08] I love the level of detail they put in
[33:11] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:13] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:16] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:19] love those watches so so
[33:22] much it's so interesting for me um
[33:25] because that's that's actually a
[33:26] question I'm I'm wrestling with I mean
[33:28] it has absolutely Z to do with Bitcoin
[33:31] uh but uh it's when I see that this is
[33:35] concept of wealth creation uh where you
[33:39] either stay at one place or you move
[33:41] around a little bit and then I even like
[33:43] a research de at one point and finding
[33:45] people uh that are now really wealthy uh
[33:50] if they moved a lot in their live or if
[33:52] they just stayed at one place I think
[33:55] the most famous example of like staying
[33:58] at one place and and getting really
[34:00] wealthy is like War Buffett I think he's
[34:03] famous for like still being in the same
[34:05] house he was in like with with 20 years
[34:07] old or something like that yeah uh so
[34:10] that that's like one one example of that
[34:12] there's some other examples who have
[34:13] moved like El musk moved uh from from I
[34:16] think South Africa he is right if I'm
[34:18] not mistaken um then there like examples
[34:21] like Jeff Bezos who has moved from
[34:25] Albuquerque uh but he's not not complete
[34:28] like the same basically the same country
[34:30] and he just moved like once for Amazon
[34:33] um so so it's an interesting thing
[34:36] because I also thought about okay maybe
[34:38] because this year is the first year
[34:40] where I'm location independent and I
[34:42] could go wherever I want to to to be um
[34:46] but uh it's like you have to get your
[34:49] stuff there and then you're like oh
[34:51] let's settle there and what is different
[34:53] there that then there might be like tax
[34:55] advantages there might be the cultural
[34:57] differences
[34:58] um so you have to have like either a
[35:00] reason to go out of Austria or like an
[35:02] an reason to go in somewhere else might
[35:04] be El Salvador might be an interesting
[35:06] place there's a lot of bitcoiners even
[35:07] like from German place I think Mark from
[35:10] Bitcoin Hotel blocking in is is one
[35:12] famous example right now who decided to
[35:14] go there um but for me it's like if if
[35:17] nothing pushes me out really of Austria
[35:19] and it's a interesting play because it's
[35:21] also in the EU and I'm focusing a lot on
[35:24] focusing I'm I'm seeing a lot the
[35:26] politicians in the you and I'm like yeah
[35:28] I don't know if I'm really liking what's
[35:31] the direction we are going but still
[35:33] till now it's it's fine but it's an
[35:35] interesting conversation of like um
[35:38] moving around a lot um uh or like like I
[35:42] know that experiencing and and really
[35:44] like seeing other countries is amazing
[35:47] for yourself and I did that already a
[35:48] lot um but if if like moving around a
[35:52] lot like um I forgot the names how
[35:55] they're called digital nomades yeah
[35:58] nads was also thinking of like maybe
[36:00] starting that but there are a lot of
[36:02] disadvantages also that that moving
[36:04] around but I just like wanted to to
[36:07] throw that out because it's a question
[36:09] I've been wrestling with uh this year a
[36:11] little bit uh as it's the first year
[36:13] that it's even possible for me right I
[36:16] mean I think a couple things I'll say
[36:18] this is how I approach you know my
[36:20] YouTube channel and when I chat with
[36:22] friends and family like I try not to
[36:24] prescribe anything so I obviously don't
[36:26] know your situation Robin and like the
[36:28] details but um what I would say is you
[36:32] know I think what you said is really
[36:35] instructive right like you have this
[36:37] opportunity that you never had before
[36:39] and that was certainly one of the
[36:40] reasons for me was you know I was
[36:42] working remote you know in a weird way
[36:44] because of what happened in 2020 and how
[36:47] you know in office work didn't happen so
[36:49] I just took advantage of that situation
[36:51] as best I could now obviously a million
[36:55] of things could have happened and I
[36:56] could have ended up not
[36:58] moving abroad I could have ended up you
[37:00] know moving somewhere else if I didn't
[37:02] meet my my wife and all this stuff so I
[37:04] think life has a way of working itself
[37:06] out I wouldn't necessarily force it but
[37:08] if you do have that like inkling that
[37:10] like that like feeling I think there's
[37:13] ways to at least explore it and and
[37:15] maybe I'll share actually this is maybe
[37:16] actionable for you or anyone listening
[37:18] like before I decided to move to Korea
[37:20] like I'd never been to Korea before so I
[37:22] actually did a month in Korea um
[37:25] Canadians I think can be in Korea for I
[37:27] think it's 60 days but certainly at
[37:29] least 30 days um so I did a month in
[37:32] Korea and just tried the food tried
[37:34] living more like a local as opposed to
[37:36] just like staying in the hotel and doing
[37:37] the touristy stuff I don't think I even
[37:39] went to any touristy you know I haven't
[37:41] even been to the palace and I've lived
[37:42] here for you know a year and a half the
[37:44] palace is like a massive tourist
[37:46] attraction in Soul and so you can kind
[37:48] of pilot it out in small doses and just
[37:50] see if you like it and then the other
[37:52] thing I'll say honestly like I think
[37:54] what you're doing with the podcast like
[37:55] speaking with so many people from
[37:56] diverse backgrounds like that obviously
[37:59] doesn't replace geographically moving
[38:01] and living in a new culture but you're
[38:03] certainly getting a wide array of
[38:05] perspectives and information that the
[38:08] average person isn't so you know I think
[38:11] you know it is the is the end goal just
[38:16] to live in another country for the sake
[38:17] of living in another country or is it to
[38:19] expand our mind like you said to to
[38:20] build wealth not just monetary wealth
[38:23] but just life experience and perspective
[38:25] and open-mindedness like I think other
[38:27] ways that you can do that if you say try
[38:30] it and aren't a huge fan of you know
[38:33] living somewhere else or digal nomading
[38:35] so um every everyone's path will be
[38:38] different I love that a lot I'm a big
[38:40] fan of having a a home base and then
[38:44] being as free as possible so you can
[38:46] still like oh like I will be now three
[38:48] weeks in America then like four weeks
[38:51] obviously that's uh a big luxury that
[38:54] you have to work a lot towards because
[38:56] like every travel uh is like you have to
[38:59] pay the flight you have to pay this it's
[39:01] it's also time that goes way if I for
[39:03] example travel now to America I do it I
[39:06] travel in November to El Salvador to
[39:08] bitcoin adop adopting Bitcoin conference
[39:10] nice but that's a whole day that just
[39:13] goes by with just traveling like that
[39:16] the cost whole day uh I think that's a
[39:19] big expense that people don't think
[39:20] about uh the traveling expense not just
[39:23] like the the Euro amount that you spend
[39:25] but also the the time that you spend on
[39:27] there
[39:28] uh but it's weth worth it I think that
[39:30] that that's for sure one question that
[39:32] uh comes came up to my mind right now is
[39:35] um what do you think will Bitcoin do to
[39:39] our view of of wealth like how we view
[39:43] uh how how rich and how wealthy we are
[39:46] and and how our few of of time and all
[39:49] those things yeah oh that's such a good
[39:51] question Rob and honestly I think I was
[39:53] having had a similar thought in my mind
[39:54] when I used the word wealth there
[39:55] because it's such a it's such a powerful
[39:58] word and you know there's a reason I
[40:00] named my channel wealth potion and not
[40:02] money potion right I think money of
[40:04] course is a huge part of wealth like we
[40:07] live in a world where where money is
[40:10] energy and you know quote Michael sailor
[40:13] here for a better analogy but it is if
[40:15] we spend our time which is our most
[40:18] finite
[40:19] resource being productive doing work
[40:22] providing products and services and
[40:23] we're compensated in money because it's
[40:25] the most liquid form of of you know
[40:28] value that we can we can come up with
[40:32] and of course that money is going to
[40:34] enable all the other things that we want
[40:36] in life whether that's you know and
[40:39] there's you know this this Trope you
[40:41] know money can't buy happiness it can
[40:44] you know yeah it can't buy the emotion
[40:45] of happiness but it can certainly buy
[40:47] things that provide you with happiness
[40:49] and you know if you really care about
[40:51] your family I mean money can help you
[40:53] support your family if you really care
[40:54] about you know um pick your poison if
[40:58] you really care about your friendships
[41:00] then obviously you can buy gifts and
[41:02] experiences for your friends if you you
[41:04] know really care about your health you
[41:05] can pay for a personal trainer you can
[41:07] buy more healthy foods you can buy a gym
[41:10] membership so money is the field that
[41:12] enables us to achieve those other things
[41:14] and at least in my mind I think wealth
[41:17] is a bit more encompassing than money
[41:20] now that being said I have had people
[41:22] that you know have said oh wealth potion
[41:24] that seems very just about financial and
[41:26] I suppose it is but at least to me I
[41:28] think one wealth is broader than just
[41:32] you know monetary units and two I think
[41:35] in a sense everyone can come up with
[41:38] their own version of what a wealthy life
[41:40] is right you know I I really care about
[41:42] for instance having you know my you know
[41:45] having my own home I ideally love to
[41:47] have a place in Canada where my family
[41:49] is and also in Korea where my wife's
[41:51] family is um other people aren't as big
[41:54] of a fan of that maybe they know their
[41:56] version of wealth is you know living in
[41:58] a cabin and being offgrid maybe some
[42:00] people love the city life right so
[42:02] anyways I I think wealth can be a lot
[42:05] more rich and diverse than just money
[42:08] but at the same time money is a big
[42:10] component of it so I don't want to take
[42:11] away from you know the monetary element
[42:14] I
[42:15] suppose absolutely and for me um other
[42:19] people might see it differently but for
[42:21] me in wealth is Health in there like if
[42:24] if you are truly wealthy like there's
[42:26] Health in there
[42:27] uh there's like a lot of interesting
[42:29] stories around that but if if you have
[42:31] uh if you have all the money in the
[42:33] world but but you cannot even go out of
[42:36] your bed because you have some sickness
[42:38] and some illness what does it really
[42:40] like what do you really have then and
[42:43] that's what a lot of people don't don't
[42:46] see it's also it's actually a comment I
[42:48] get a lot because I do a daily Bitcoin
[42:49] podcast and for some reason people think
[42:51] that I work like 100 hours a week to
[42:54] keep it up it's not that much it's like
[42:55] 35 to 40 hours plus then some additional
[42:59] work with like sponsors and additional
[43:01] work with things so it's probably more
[43:03] than the average person works but it's
[43:05] not that crazy it's not IL musk level
[43:07] till now I think he works more than me
[43:09] uh but yeah it's it's it's definitely
[43:11] interesting to have
[43:13] have I love the word wealth to be
[43:16] honestly I know it's it's not as as
[43:19] popular sometimes but I love that you
[43:21] call it wealth portion not money or like
[43:23] anything else like wealth is an a good
[43:26] one but did you already uh orange pill
[43:28] your your family is is that
[43:31] already I orange ped some of them so my
[43:34] so I I think I messaged you this on
[43:36] Twitter so I the first person probably I
[43:38] orange build aside from my wife to you
[43:40] know convince her that being
[43:42] irresponsibly long Bitcoin is a good
[43:44] thing I orange peeled my dad and uh he
[43:47] is he is Allin I don't want to say Allin
[43:50] like net worth wise but he is fully you
[43:52] know orange pilled um he also mines
[43:54] Bitcoin which is harder for me to do and
[43:57] you know an apartment in South Korea so
[43:58] I'm I'm very proud of of his Bitcoin
[44:00] Journey um I have a lot of like cousins
[44:03] and you know more kind of extended
[44:05] relatives that I haven't orange pilled
[44:07] yet but um I'm hoping hoping to to do
[44:11] that in you know 2024 2025 uh time frame
[44:14] for sure and and maybe just one quick
[44:16] comment you just remind me when you're
[44:17] talking about wealth and the wealth
[44:19] potion thing um we you know the reason I
[44:24] named it wealth potion by the way is
[44:25] just a play on words of Health po right
[44:27] I'm 30 years old I'm a millennial I grew
[44:29] up playing video games and you know
[44:31] generally there's like a health potion
[44:32] item where you you pick it up and you
[44:34] get like inspired and your character
[44:37] regains health and you can continue
[44:38] playing the game and I thought that that
[44:41] was like a fun way to connect with
[44:43] younger people right I I've heard from a
[44:45] lot of content creators that one of the
[44:47] best ways to create content is just
[44:49] create content for your younger self
[44:51] because they're you know one to two
[44:52] years behind you and you know there's
[44:54] going to be people that are in a similar
[44:56] space
[44:57] and I guess related to this is I'm very
[45:01] passionate about education changing I
[45:04] think the future of education is going
[45:05] to be podcasts like yours it's going to
[45:07] be YouTube channels it's going to be Tik
[45:09] Tok whether we like it or not it's you
[45:11] know screen time is going up and you
[45:14] know we can obviously look see a lot of
[45:16] the downsides to that right with the ra
[45:18] rise of ADHD and all these challenges
[45:21] you know learning challenges that kids
[45:23] are having but in an element and as much
[45:26] as we can limit screen time and you know
[45:28] there's ways to kind of foster a more
[45:30] healthy relationship with screens that
[45:32] the reality is we have more screens
[45:34] right when I was growing up it was like
[45:36] Nintendo 64 and I could play over one
[45:39] hour a night and that was it right now
[45:41] kids have screens everywhere right they
[45:43] get laptops in school and you know they
[45:46] probably have a iPhone by the time
[45:48] they're they're in like high school as
[45:50] well and so I think education is is
[45:53] quite frankly changing and I think the
[45:55] future of education is going be online
[45:57] and to connect this back to bitcoin I
[46:00] think it's going to be decentralized I
[46:01] think it is not you know as much as
[46:04] there absolutely is this um kind of long
[46:07] tail or Nim TB would put it like a
[46:10] stream a stand right you have these
[46:11] creators that are you know making tons
[46:13] of money and there's like a kind of
[46:16] larger base of people that are doing it
[46:18] more as a hobby I think over time there
[46:20] will be more and more content creators
[46:22] that are able to do it and earn a
[46:25] full-time living and they aren't you
[46:27] know making millions tens of millions of
[46:28] dollars um and it's just going to become
[46:31] more and more mainstream and I think
[46:32] that's a that's a great thing I mean
[46:35] universities and higher education have
[46:36] been getting themselves into plenty of
[46:38] scandals over the past few years and you
[46:41] know when I speak with young people
[46:43] again I try not to prescribe them but I
[46:47] usually emphasize the downsides of just
[46:51] blindly going into a University degree
[46:53] because that's what their parents told
[46:55] them to do or that's what you know
[46:56] Society tells them to do because I think
[46:59] that whole world is is changing very
[47:01] very
[47:03] rapidly really cool I probably don't
[47:06] follow that rule of making content for
[47:09] younger people as my average age for the
[47:12] viewers here is 47 oh wow that's
[47:15] interesting and I have like three times
[47:18] as many people over 65 than under 25 and
[47:21] I'm like 26 so uh Mo all like 95% of my
[47:26] viewers are older than me which is
[47:29] interesting to see um but as this brings
[47:34] me to the next question you said like uh
[47:36] content creating for for young people
[47:38] and the 12th portion are really
[47:40] interesting what amount do do you have a
[47:43] framework for like what amount of
[47:45] Bitcoin should young people try to
[47:47] accumulate to be wealthy in their 30s
[47:51] 40s 50s when they come closer to like uh
[47:55] retirement and all those things did you
[47:58] do you have a framework for that or a
[48:00] way to think about that think I I think
[48:03] of it more in terms of like principles
[48:06] and patterns I try not to subscribe too
[48:09] much to like models you know I I you
[48:12] know I'm a Bitcoin Bitcoin or Circa 2020
[48:15] which is when Plan B and you know that
[48:18] model was very popular and it you know
[48:22] it got destroyed pretty much and I know
[48:24] right now there's the power law and i'
[48:26] I've had some t back and forth with
[48:27] Giovani very smart guy I think he was on
[48:29] the podcast if I I recall or um that
[48:33] that's awesome and and so I think models
[48:35] are useful but I am just very cautious
[48:37] of using them as predictors because
[48:41] what's that saying you know uh all
[48:43] models are useful but they're all always
[48:44] wrong I can't remember what the saying
[48:46] is but oh uh like uh every model
[48:50] is they are all useful but they all I
[48:54] also don't know it I thought I knew it
[48:56] sorry you you know the one we're talking
[48:58] about but yeah that like so anyways to
[49:00] answer your question more directly how
[49:02] much how much Bitcoin should a young
[49:03] person accumulate I mean the obvious
[49:05] first answer is get off zero like get
[49:08] some um you know my first Bitcoin
[49:10] purchase it was again 2016 I think it
[49:14] was in the the high hundreds of dollars
[49:17] I probably bought like $20 on coinbase
[49:19] if I remember it wasn't much but it was
[49:22] something and I think that first
[49:24] purchase it's like a lot of content
[49:25] creators talk about this too like
[49:27] earning your first dollar online changes
[49:29] everything because then you start to
[49:32] it's it opens up this whole new world I
[49:34] think Bitcoin is similar like once you
[49:35] buy your first few Satoshi then you
[49:38] start to you know learn about what this
[49:42] investment is that you're holding at
[49:43] least you should you should start to
[49:44] learn about what is this thing maybe
[49:46] I'll go check out the white paper and
[49:47] read that maybe I'll go read the post
[49:49] that Satoshi posted on the peer-to-peer
[49:52] Foundation Forum oh he mentions that the
[49:55] problem is Central Bank can print money
[49:57] well I don't know much about central
[49:58] banks I should learn about that and you
[50:00] know I think it's curiosity the the
[50:03] Curiosity that leads a young person to
[50:05] buy their first few Satoshi is the
[50:07] Curiosity that's going to lead them to
[50:08] be wealthy right so I think it's less
[50:10] about how much Bitcoin do you own it's
[50:12] having that mentality of open-mindedness
[50:15] and learning because like I'll be honest
[50:17] and this maybe is you know uh not the
[50:21] best best thing to say but like the
[50:22] first time I heard about Bitcoin was not
[50:24] 2016 it was 2013 I was in University one
[50:27] of the top Business Schools in uh Canada
[50:30] and I think you had Jesse Myers on the
[50:31] show as well he wrote this legendary
[50:33] article back in the day of how like the
[50:35] yepy you know yepy I forget how he
[50:37] phrased it but like the yepy like
[50:39] consultant class are the the most likely
[50:42] to miss Bitcoin because they are stuck
[50:44] in these like business school models and
[50:46] that was me that was me in business
[50:47] school I was like somebody mentioned
[50:49] Bitcoin to me I was like what is this
[50:50] this what is a silly thing it's a toy
[50:53] and that like looking back I was so
[50:56] wrong and it was just because I was
[50:57] close-minded to it it it had nothing to
[50:59] do with me knowing better it was just I
[51:03] completely brushed off the idea because
[51:06] it would have forced me to challenge the
[51:09] things that I was learning in business
[51:11] school and I think that's that's like
[51:15] the number one kind of takeaway I would
[51:16] say from like a mental model standpoint
[51:19] it's just beware of close-mindedness and
[51:23] do whatever you can to continue learning
[51:26] and continue you know Foster a love for
[51:29] learning right like that's that's you
[51:31] know I know I'm all over the place here
[51:32] but one other thing I'll say like I
[51:34] think the best teachers and the best
[51:36] content creators for that matter are not
[51:38] necessarily the ones that are best at
[51:40] teaching it's the ones that are the best
[51:42] at fostering a love for learning the
[51:45] ones that want that get people
[51:47] interested and that's why I think it's
[51:49] no surprise that education and
[51:51] entertainment has kind of kind of
[51:53] morphed into edutainment people are
[51:55] calling now where people want to learn
[51:57] but they also want to be entertained
[51:58] because that makes it fun and that makes
[52:00] it engaging and it makes them come back
[52:02] the next day to learn more and so
[52:05] anyways I went off on a tangent there
[52:07] but yeah I'm very passionate about that
[52:10] yeah I love how you frv Al the the
[52:13] answer of like let's get off zero first
[52:16] uh is is perfect because I think it also
[52:19] what we talking about earlier of
[52:20] planting the seed uh that just like
[52:23] gives you the the opportunity to learn
[52:25] about it and exper experience it
[52:27] actually so like that's that's like um I
[52:30] always say like if if you think uh that
[52:33] Bitcoin even has like a 1% chance of
[52:36] completely uh revolutionizing the
[52:39] financial world even if you just put it
[52:41] at a 1% chance you should put at least
[52:43] 1% of your liquid net worth in Bitcoin
[52:46] and see what's happens because it's not
[52:48] a lot if you're wrong like you lose 1%
[52:50] it's not that much but if you are right
[52:54] and you haven't uh
[52:56] uh uh at least about 1% of it you're
[53:00] standing there with like empty hands and
[53:02] that's that's probably the the um that's
[53:05] probably the most dangerous place to be
[53:07] uh not having any Bitcoin in a Bitcoin
[53:10] world like that that seems to be an an
[53:12] awful place to be and also like um the
[53:16] one question that I probably should have
[53:18] asked way earlier than than that as
[53:20] you're coming from EI what do you think
[53:23] is the connection between EI and Bitcoin
[53:25] Isa connection and will AI usually like
[53:28] choose Bitcoin or that do transact as
[53:31] they probably don't have a bank account
[53:33] that's a good question I but the short
[53:34] answer is I don't know for sure but I'm
[53:36] I'm happy to share my opinion from what
[53:38] I've seen working at you know two AI
[53:41] startups now for about seven years I
[53:45] think maybe I'll start with this Which
[53:47] is less about Bitcoin but just about AI
[53:49] in general I think AI is
[53:51] revolutionary but that it is certainly
[53:53] in bubble territory and I think you know
[53:56] you know there are a lot of similarities
[53:58] to the dot bubble of 2000 you know I was
[54:02] too young to really understand it but
[54:03] obviously having studied it and looking
[54:06] back at history and you know you know
[54:08] watching a lot of financial analysts
[54:10] that did you know work and invest
[54:12] through that period you know I think
[54:14] some of the similarities are that yes
[54:16] the internet was revolutionary it
[54:19] completely changed the world but the
[54:22] hype really spiked in the beginning the
[54:26] hype Bubble Burst and then we started to
[54:28] see the real use cases really get built
[54:30] out and it wasn't in a matter of months
[54:32] it was in a matter of years and don't
[54:34] get me wrong like AI has the potential
[54:37] to move a lot faster than the internet
[54:39] because it's kind of recursive in that
[54:41] sense but I still think something
[54:42] similar is going on where there is more
[54:45] hype than there are real use cases of AI
[54:48] today now that can change rapidly I
[54:51] could be proved wrong very very soon but
[54:54] I think it's very froy right now as as
[54:57] investors might say you know if you're
[54:59] investing in Nidia stocks for example
[55:01] you know could there be more upside
[55:03] absolutely I mean that just cut rates
[55:05] China is you know shooting a liquidity
[55:07] bazooka at the Chinese economy like we
[55:09] could get you know further stock market
[55:12] all-time highs for another few months or
[55:15] even quarters but do I think that it's
[55:20] going to just keep going up and to the
[55:21] right until AI has you know transformed
[55:24] the economy no I think I think there is
[55:26] going to be some sort of Correction
[55:28] that's at least my my take on the
[55:29] finance side of things again not
[55:31] Financial advice uh when it comes to
[55:33] bitcoin though I think yeah I mean I
[55:36] think there is a clear connection to AI
[55:40] agents for for for those that aren't
[55:42] familiar you know AI there's chat GPT
[55:44] which is a chat interface but an AI
[55:46] agent is is an AI that can then go off
[55:50] and do its own tasks and so it it
[55:53] becomes agential agential I think is the
[55:57] term people using agent agentic where
[56:00] it's it's not conscious you know I don't
[56:02] want to get all metaphysical here but it
[56:04] can conduct its own tasks can follow its
[56:06] own instructions and then it can come
[56:08] back to you with a report and you know
[56:11] if you tell your AI agent to you know go
[56:16] book me a trip you know book me a trip
[56:19] to New Zealand a onee trip I really love
[56:21] Seafood I'm allergic to gluten you know
[56:24] book me all these details and it needs
[56:26] to make transactions to do that why
[56:29] would it use the US dollar why would it
[56:31] use any fiat currency right it would
[56:34] very likely use a digital Curr digitally
[56:37] native currency and you know you know
[56:40] this is where obviously as a bitcoiner
[56:43] that thinks that most of crypto is a
[56:45] scam I think it should be Bitcoin it
[56:46] should be on the lightning Network
[56:49] now Sam Altman is the head of chat GPT
[56:54] and he's also a huge I don't know
[56:56] exactly his role but he's involved in
[56:58] that like whole world coin thing so you
[57:00] know is there a world where these AI
[57:02] companies start using these private
[57:05] cryptocurrencies to transact it's
[57:08] possible I won't love it but I do think
[57:11] it's possible and so you know I don't
[57:15] have a definitive conclusion there
[57:17] obviously I think Bitcoin should be that
[57:19] currency because it is the most
[57:21] decentralized it is the most widely
[57:23] distributed it has the immaculate
[57:26] conception if you will of you know not
[57:28] having VC backers in it but I'm sure
[57:32] there's going to be efforts from the
[57:33] crypto ecosystem to finagle their way
[57:37] into these AI models and be the
[57:40] transaction medium of choice um so yeah
[57:44] crypto's not going any away anytime soon
[57:46] as much as I hate to say
[57:49] that yeah I also think so um it's
[57:52] interesting because you brought up
[57:54] Nvidia and this shows the power of
[57:57] Bitcoin in the last four years since
[57:59] micro strategy adopted a Bitcoin
[58:02] standard in their company they have
[58:05] actually
[58:06] outperformed every single S&P 500
[58:10] company including inid and that is
[58:14] something uh that will give
[58:18] every uhb 500 CEO and shareholders a lot
[58:23] to think about because there's this one
[58:25] compy
[58:26] that was on a downward Trend that was
[58:29] kind of having a business model that is
[58:32] getting outdated uh and all of a sudden
[58:35] they adopted a Bitcoin standard they're
[58:37] developing new business uh models around
[58:39] that uh and they completely fuel their
[58:43] um business with that like I'm big on
[58:46] like buy Bitcoin not like some some some
[58:50] stock that have Bitcoin um but Micro
[58:53] strategy has outperformed every single
[58:56] S&P 500 company uh since 2020 and I
[58:59] think that really uh goes to show you
[59:03] what's what's the power of Bitcoin uh I
[59:05] just want to bring that in as as you
[59:07] mentioned Nvidia and I think Nvidia as
[59:09] is in a might be in a bubbly State I
[59:11] have no clue because I I've been a stock
[59:14] Pro before like I I've come from a stock
[59:16] Pro background uh but I have not
[59:19] researched any stock since 2021 so like
[59:23] three year I have really no clue about
[59:25] Nvidia
[59:26] uh but it seems like there's a lot of
[59:29] hype around it uh and and and Bitcoin
[59:32] seems just to be the like the obvious
[59:34] choice right now for me at least um yeah
[59:36] it's it's interesting how do you see
[59:38] like when when when when all the public
[59:40] traded companies see more more what's
[59:42] going on with with micr strategy I mean
[59:44] they kind of might be moving but the the
[59:48] things they maybe they're moving slower
[59:51] than micro strategy well you know what
[59:53] Robin do you want to hear my like one of
[59:54] my hottest takes actually
[59:57] so okay so to give some context the last
[59:59] startup I was at we used AI to conduct
[60:02] competitive intelligence which is
[60:04] basically a fancy way of saying that we
[60:05] helped large companies like a micro
[60:07] strategy track their competitors and
[60:09] what their competitors were doing and
[60:11] one of the things that I learned working
[60:13] at an industry is that you know when you
[60:14] get to these like really large
[60:16] Enterprise companies a lot like a lot of
[60:19] people like to think that you know at
[60:21] these high level sales deals that it's
[60:23] like really you know it's really about
[60:25] the product right build it and they will
[60:26] come this product is better than the
[60:28] others a lot of these products do a lot
[60:30] of the same things and there's very like
[60:33] the differentiation between two
[60:35] enterprise software products is really
[60:37] in the margins and Deals like a sales
[60:39] deal where if someone's evaluating say
[60:41] micro strategy versus powerbi or Domo or
[60:45] one of these other business intelligence
[60:47] platforms you know that deal could be
[60:49] one just because the sales rep took the
[60:51] person out for dinner one more time so
[60:53] they went golfing and they really liked
[60:54] each other like that's how a lot of
[60:55] these Enterprise deals are still done
[60:58] and I don't again don't want to you know
[61:00] I'm just using that as an example as an
[61:01] illustration right I'm not saying that
[61:02] that's literally what happens but my
[61:04] point is that differentiation happens on
[61:06] the margins so here comes my hot take
[61:10] what happens when Square needs a
[61:13] business intelligence platform or if
[61:15] they're gonna maybe they already used
[61:17] one but they're coming up for renewal on
[61:19] their business intelligence platform and
[61:21] they need to evaluate the platforms on
[61:23] the market what happens when SpaceX or
[61:27] Tesla or one of eon's companies you know
[61:30] needs a business intelligence platform I
[61:32] think the idea of a company
[61:35] being having their treasury in Bitcoin
[61:38] will become a very strong competitive
[61:42] Advantage for them and I would not be
[61:44] surprised if there are micro strategy
[61:47] customers where the CEOs of those those
[61:50] companies that purchased micr strategy
[61:52] software did it simply because they are
[61:55] bitcoiners
[61:56] and they want to support another Bitcoin
[61:58] company and that is another way that I I
[62:01] think that's a whole subject that is not
[62:03] talked about a lot we talk a lot about
[62:05] you know this parallel system that's
[62:07] being built and you know you feel it too
[62:09] you mentioned you're going to go to El
[62:10] Salvador if you've been to other Bitcoin
[62:11] conferences like you want to transact
[62:13] with Bitcoin vendors because you know
[62:15] you want to contribute to that circular
[62:16] economy I think that's going to happen
[62:18] at the B2B scale with like six figure
[62:20] seven figure eight figure deals and I
[62:23] think that's like we're very very much
[62:25] in the early Innings I mean just the
[62:27] fact that no other company has really
[62:29] done what EC strategy has done yet I
[62:31] mean there's metap Planet out in you
[62:33] know just just next door to me over in
[62:35] Japan um but very few public companies
[62:39] have caught on and I think that is going
[62:41] to change and I think there was a if I
[62:43] recall correctly Michael sailor was
[62:45] talking about this recently there was a
[62:46] recent change to the way um fair value
[62:50] accounting is done that could open up
[62:52] the floodgates so if there are any you
[62:54] know CFOs out there that have been
[62:57] watching intently at micro strategy
[62:59] stock performance right like publicly
[63:01] traded companies they have a fiduciary
[63:04] duty to their shareholders
[63:07] so you have to you have to at least
[63:10] accept that every Fortune 500 company is
[63:13] at least aware of what micro strategy is
[63:16] and at least a surface level
[63:18] understanding of what they've done right
[63:20] no CFO of a Fortune 500 company is being
[63:23] asked by another CFO over dinner oh do
[63:26] you hear about micro strategy the CFO is
[63:28] not saying no what is that right like
[63:30] they they have to be aware of these
[63:31] things so I think it's just a matter of
[63:33] time and you know I don't I don't want
[63:36] to get too like hyper bullish and like
[63:37] excited but I think it's it's one of
[63:40] those things that is underappreciated I
[63:43] think it's going to be way bigger than
[63:45] say the ETFs and you know the impacts
[63:47] that that have had on uh on bitcoin but
[63:50] yeah that's that's maybe my hottest my
[63:52] hottest take that's actually something
[63:55] that's coming the fastp rule uh it's I
[63:58] think the 15th of December I just like
[64:00] research quickly because I knew it is
[64:03] either November December but here it
[64:04] says like 15th of December uh and for
[64:08] some uh institutions uh 15th of December
[64:11] 2025 it seems like there's like an
[64:14] difference between what kind of
[64:16] Institutions but I just like quickly
[64:18] read something uh there's actually one
[64:20] of the like this year is pretty crazy we
[64:23] had the Haring we had the Bitcoin ETF we
[64:27] have a major election uh in America
[64:30] where all of a sudden the one like one
[64:33] of the um candidates with Trump is
[64:37] actually um embracing Bitcoin to a
[64:40] certain extent even though it's really
[64:42] he also Embraces crypto he also has his
[64:45] own token and and it's it's a little
[64:47] weird uh what he does with with Bitcoin
[64:49] and crypto uh and but there are a lot of
[64:52] like RFK and is in administration other
[64:55] other people
[64:56] Riv Ras fa I think he also understands
[64:58] Bitcoin way better JD van is I think
[65:01] underestimated in the Bitcoin Community
[65:03] he's really also um way more bitcoiner
[65:06] than Trump I think and also even like
[65:08] his his uh this is his brother his son
[65:12] no uh uh Donald Trump Jr I don't know
[65:15] like I don't I don't follow him that
[65:17] quick but there's like someone in his
[65:19] area it's also really big on on bitcoin
[65:22] then we have this fastp rule a lot of
[65:24] people think that's what one major
[65:26] Catalyst that's not talked a lot because
[65:28] it's just like an accounting Rule and
[65:30] nobody cares about accounting rule but
[65:31] it really changes something for big
[65:33] businesses uh so this this here is could
[65:37] be could be huge for like end of next
[65:39] year uh when we look back and all the
[65:42] things settle in so I also try to not be
[65:46] too hyper bullish uh and and settle
[65:48] myself definitely like I I want to be
[65:51] not like be crazy and like oh [ __ ] I
[65:53] have to get now every Satoshi because
[65:55] maybe we are next year at like 500,000 I
[65:58] don't think so so I want to also don't
[66:03] blame my own bullishness but with
[66:05] interviewing every day Bitcoin it's
[66:07] actually really hard to stay not too
[66:09] bullish it's it's really hard I hear you
[66:12] I bet and and the one thing I will say
[66:14] like while I try not to make predictions
[66:16] of a certain price at a certain date I
[66:18] think it's going up right like I'm I'm
[66:20] irresponsibly long I think you know I
[66:23] think again Julian said this and I fully
[66:25] agree with it
[66:26] uh when he was on your podcast that I
[66:28] think one of the only bare cases for
[66:30] Bitcoin is a fiscally responsible
[66:32] government and I just don't see that
[66:35] happening Ever In Our Lifetime and and
[66:37] it's not even like a you know a
[66:39] Libertarian like government suck kind of
[66:41] view I think they just have no other
[66:43] choice they have no choice but to keep
[66:44] printing money because they are so
[66:47] indebted and by they I'm really talking
[66:49] about the us but it's really Global at
[66:51] this point that they really have the the
[66:54] other options would be austerity or
[66:57] defaulting on the debt or some AI
[67:01] miracle that creates so much abundance
[67:04] that you know everyone is like rich and
[67:07] you know like they're so out there in
[67:09] terms of probability that I think by far
[67:13] the most likely outcome is just
[67:16] continued Financial repression just
[67:18] continued two to 3% inflation maybe it
[67:21] spikes back up to like four or 5% but I
[67:23] think the new fed target is no longer or
[67:25] 2% I think it's 3% they just have never
[67:27] said it they probably never will but I
[67:30] think we're just going to slowly see
[67:31] that Mel that Fiat Ice Cube melt away a
[67:35] bit slower than it has before and
[67:38] they're just going to pray and hope that
[67:40] it still melts slowly enough that people
[67:42] don't
[67:44] notice yeah it's I think also like all
[67:47] those globalizing effects and eii and
[67:50] getting more efficient those are all the
[67:52] things that actually could kick down the
[67:54] Fiat can and little bit longer because
[67:57] when we get more efficient uh this makes
[68:00] things cheaper and then the money
[68:02] printing with inflation is not that
[68:05] noticeable so uh that that that could
[68:08] actually be happening I think all those
[68:10] getting more efficient Trends is really
[68:12] good for the Feld system to uh work a
[68:16] few more years a few more decades maybe
[68:19] even uh longer that we that we want I
[68:22] hope it goes away soon but I think it
[68:24] will be around for a long time uh in
[68:28] some way or shape or form with a
[68:30] different name and instead of the Euro
[68:32] it's the digital Euro or whatever but it
[68:35] will be there in in some capacity I
[68:37] think at least yeah really cool then uh
[68:40] um we are coming closer to our end uh
[68:42] and one question to ask every one of my
[68:45] guests is what can we learn from you
[68:48] besides uh Bitcoin a great question I
[68:50] think as mentioned I'm trying to educate
[68:53] people through wealth potion around
[68:56] Financial Concepts that you could say
[68:58] are kind of leading indicators into
[69:00] Bitcoin the topics that I learned about
[69:04] on my path to becoming a full-blown
[69:06] bitcoiner such as quantity of easing
[69:09] Central Banking inflation the economy um
[69:13] particularly macroeconomics less so
[69:15] about microeconomics but I think another
[69:17] one you know I touched on it a little
[69:19] bit in our our chat today Robin is you
[69:21] know leaning on some of my experience in
[69:24] the tech startup world so you know a big
[69:27] part of that was around sales and
[69:29] persuasion and the kind of the game
[69:32] theory behind you know adoption of
[69:34] Bitcoin I think that's a very
[69:36] fascinating side of things right that's
[69:37] why I get excited about this you know
[69:39] fby Rule and these you know other events
[69:42] that are happening in Bitcoin because I
[69:44] think over time that's what's going to
[69:46] drive adoption and you know Bitcoin is
[69:49] perfect as it is but a perfect product
[69:51] does not equal adoption um so those I'd
[69:55] say are the the main things that uh you
[69:57] can learn learn from me from and you
[70:00] know one thing I always say in my videos
[70:01] like I'm always open to feedback right
[70:03] like if people start you know go going
[70:05] on my channel and start commenting hey I
[70:07] really want to learn about this other
[70:08] thing like I'm happy to dive into that
[70:10] and learn about it myself because I
[70:12] think learning I'm very passionate about
[70:14] learning be being a fun and
[70:19] engaging thing it's it's not this like
[70:21] one to many you know classroom it's it
[70:24] really should be engaging and a dialogue
[70:28] like podcast and so um yeah that's those
[70:32] are the things I'm teaching about now
[70:33] but that could all change in a year so
[70:35] I'm excited to see where my uh my
[70:37] content creation Journey takes
[70:38] me I love that Al like the the feedback
[70:41] I think the the best content creators
[70:43] are always those who um grow with their
[70:46] community and really do a project with
[70:50] the audience and not just like oh I will
[70:53] put out a video every day and just like
[70:55] put something out there and uh who who
[70:57] likes it likes it I think the when when
[70:59] you take in the consider consideration
[71:02] of the audience and and figure out okay
[71:04] what they actually want to consume uh
[71:07] and with like what you actually want to
[71:09] do and that middle ground because where
[71:12] like people love it and you love it
[71:14] that's like the The Sweet Spot I guess
[71:17] uh and uh that's that's very nice that
[71:20] you you mentioned that I could know out
[71:22] about social media and congration a lot
[71:24] but uh it's a bit podcast it's I try to
[71:28] keep we can we can chat about skincare
[71:30] and fashion trends another time
[71:33] privately maybe yeah uh perfect then
[71:37] thank you so much we have other tin
[71:39] where the previous guest is asking a
[71:40] question for the next guest um and I
[71:43] can't believe that that question never
[71:45] was in the end routine of the of the
[71:47] podcast and it's a such a simple
[71:50] question but a question that we should
[71:53] even ask ourself uh even though we are
[71:55] already all in in Bitcoin but the
[71:57] question is from the previous guest what
[71:59] is a Bitcoin that's a big
[72:02] question might have to think about this
[72:04] one for a moment it's funny I think
[72:07] nobody ever asked me
[72:09] that like I I can give like that liberal
[72:12] kind of boring definition but I'll I'll
[72:14] try to channel my inner Michael sailor
[72:16] and give something a little bit more
[72:19] creative
[72:21] Bitcoin
[72:23] removes the imperfection
[72:26] of
[72:27] humanity from money
[72:30] it's you know if you're I don't know if
[72:32] you're religious but if you're convinced
[72:35] that you know men Humanity humans are
[72:38] sinners then we will corrupt whatever we
[72:41] get our hands on and I think Bitcoin
[72:43] removes it from our control it's the you
[72:46] know it's the rules not rulers Meme and
[72:50] I think that's that's at least the
[72:51] answer that comes to mind to me right
[72:53] now is it is it separate SE Ates money
[72:56] not just from state but it separates
[72:57] money from humanity
[73:00] and we uh we can't mess it up we just
[73:04] have to learn to trust it and have faith
[73:07] in
[73:07] it absolutely I love that a lot really
[73:10] really cool yeah thank you so much
