[00:00] for a long time I've known fat this
[00:02] dirty money you know it's just toilet
[00:04] paper it's just Monopoly money sold
[00:06] absolutely every crypto that I've ever
[00:07] had ethereum's never going to flip
[00:10] Bitcoin you know the XP Army they're so
[00:12] totally delusional and I started seeing
[00:15] that that people had bored into the
[00:17] Matrix or the scop or the propaganda the
[00:19] misinformation that was going out there
[00:21] is all just 100% marketing okay nothing
[00:24] else matters it's Bitcoin only I love
[00:26] your journey I'll stop you there I won't
[00:27] go into it I I think the biggest
[00:30] motivation Robin is when you really
[00:32] start to
[00:35] understand can you remember uh the first
[00:39] moment you heard about Bitcoin yeah man
[00:42] um so way back in the day I don't know
[00:44] what price it was in US dollar but it
[00:46] was either 94 or $96 Australian I was
[00:49] pretty sure it was $94 Australian and I
[00:52] used to work on cruise boats diving and
[00:55] things like that taking people out and
[00:56] uh guided dive tours snorkel tours
[00:59] things like that anyway we're cleaning
[01:01] the boat up after a trip and I must have
[01:04] just heard about Bitcoin maybe the week
[01:06] before or whatever I'm like I'm going to
[01:08] buy some Bitcoin you know it's it's $94
[01:10] This Magic insnap Money everyone was
[01:13] talking about Bitcoin at that stage is
[01:15] Magic insnap money and I didn't bro um
[01:19] unfortunately ended up spending that
[01:21] money on something that and peed uh my
[01:25] mind my judgments you know read between
[01:27] the lines a lot of people through
[01:29] Bitcoin probably go through that Journey
[01:32] there so I wasted that money and then
[01:34] every week I'd be like I you know I'll
[01:37] buy some Bitcoin it's sort of hung
[01:38] around that price for for quite a while
[01:39] I remember at under $120 Australian for
[01:42] a long time and then we bought some
[01:46] Bitcoin and we ended up using it on uh
[01:48] Silk Road for for things that also
[01:50] weren't good for my mind and that just
[01:53] went you know you get a a CD case in the
[01:55] mailbox uh with what was ordered and
[01:58] that was the end of it uh B basically
[02:01] and then didn't think much about Bitcoin
[02:02] for many many many years and um man I
[02:07] can't can't really recall what year that
[02:09] was but then I uh I was running these
[02:12] underwater jet skis they're called seab
[02:14] Bobs um and James Bonds they get like
[02:17] shot out of the submarine and they hang
[02:19] on to it and they're like this
[02:21] underwater scooter but a very fast one I
[02:24] was running a couple of islands up in
[02:26] the WT Sundays here in Australia on the
[02:28] Great Barrier Reef doing that and I just
[02:31] went on holiday for a break down south
[02:33] down to Barron Bay it's like where a lot
[02:35] of movie stars and stuff go and I ended
[02:37] up running into to someone a friend's
[02:40] friend so I was boring a friend's van he
[02:42] said I've just got a friend that's an
[02:45] internet entrepreneur and I won't go
[02:47] into what he did very wealthy man um
[02:50] seeing a lot of money uh in in his life
[02:52] that most people even here in Bitcoin
[02:54] we'll probably never see and we were
[02:56] talking I ended up living with him for
[02:58] quite a while and helping and buy a
[03:00] property and and his farm and things
[03:02] like that and helping him to just sort
[03:03] of get back into reality because he had
[03:06] been behind a a keyboard and a computer
[03:08] screen for many years making this Empire
[03:10] and he had just sold it and they had
[03:12] offered to pay him in Bitcoin but he
[03:16] said no I'll take
[03:18] dollars anyway um
[03:22] we we went our own ways after about 3
[03:25] months and went back up ended up meeting
[03:27] my wife and things like that and I gave
[03:30] him a call one day and
[03:32] said mate I've got $400 here what stock
[03:36] should I invest in he's like no man I I
[03:39] don't tell my friends what to invest in
[03:41] because if it goes wrong they're going
[03:43] to blame me for it I said it's $400 I'm
[03:47] happy to throw it down the toilet like
[03:49] for a long time I've known fat this
[03:52] dirty money you know it's just toilet
[03:54] paper it's just Monopoly money I've
[03:56] thought that since a very young age I
[03:58] said man he's like no I'm not telling
[04:02] you I'm like bro it's literally gone in
[04:03] the toilet and I was dead set if he
[04:05] didn't tell me I'd flush it down the
[04:06] toilet I was well willing to do that
[04:08] there's a little bit of extra money
[04:10] didn't care if I lost it so I like
[04:13] I'm not into stocks I'm into crypto and
[04:18] I'm like okay what crypto honey is
[04:20] developing you know on one of those
[04:22] shitcoins out there and I bought it at
[04:26] at that stage and I got a 10x really
[04:28] quickly with that and so I'm like what
[04:31] is this crypto thing and then I Googled
[04:33] and like Bitcoin was the first crypto to
[04:34] ever be invented so I'm like okay what
[04:37] is bitcoin and then just started going
[04:39] down that rabbit hole so deep man and
[04:42] you know a couple of hours turns into
[04:44] hundreds which turns into thousands of
[04:47] hours and so by that stage i' realized
[04:50] that Bitcoin was unique as the first
[04:53] time that scarcity had ever existed on
[04:55] planet Earth I understood that but I was
[04:58] still caught up in that mine virus of
[05:00] crypto and I played that Old Co coin
[05:03] casino and spent you know a couple of
[05:05] thousand hours within crypto going down
[05:07] that rabbit hole
[05:10] and um I'm sort of ashamed to say but it
[05:14] worked out pretty well for me I was in
[05:15] the markets every day and I realized I
[05:18] started to realize it was mainly
[05:20] narrative it did take a while I still
[05:21] saw saw some of the things I thought
[05:24] they had utility and you know I bought
[05:27] ethereum
[05:28] at mainly under $100 but a lot of it
[05:31] under $400 sort of sold it right near
[05:33] the top which was good above
[05:36] $4,000 so that amazing but all those
[05:39] profits I just kept putting straight
[05:41] back into Bitcoin because I knew Bitcoin
[05:43] was something different and the more I
[05:45] studied it the more I realized it was
[05:47] Bitcoin only and then it took me a long
[05:50] time I'm sad to say to be able to
[05:52] totally clear my mind and move away from
[05:55] the crypto side of things and go 100%
[05:58] Bitcoin only sold absolutely every
[06:00] crypto that I've ever had there's
[06:02] probably some dust in some metam mask
[06:04] somewhere wherever however to get into
[06:06] that metam mask I don't give a [ __ ] I'm
[06:08] sorry if I I swear um you can bleep that
[06:11] out but it took so long to be able to
[06:15] get past that and then I just realized
[06:17] everything else is garbage it's only
[06:19] propped up on hopes and dreams The
[06:21] Narrative ethereum's never going to flip
[06:24] Bitcoin you know the XP Army they're so
[06:27] totally delusional and I started seeing
[06:30] that that people had Bor into the Matrix
[06:32] or the scop or the propaganda the
[06:34] misinformation that was going out there
[06:35] is all just 100% marketing and then I
[06:38] just went in 100% into to crypto
[06:42] obviously uh the the c19 de was an
[06:46] amazing time by that time I'd already
[06:48] understood what Bitcoin was it drops
[06:50] down to 3,300 3,600 and I said to my
[06:54] wife sweetie this is once in a lifetime
[06:57] opportunity we had a fair amount of cash
[07:00] and in the bank and stuff and we just
[07:02] put it all into to bitcoin pretty much
[07:06] at that stage I was still uh I don't
[07:09] know how to say it politely but I was
[07:10] [ __ ] around with the shitcoins and
[07:12] that altcoin casino you're going to need
[07:13] to do a lot of
[07:15] bleeping my apologies but from from from
[07:20] there you know once you start to put a
[07:22] large sum of money for whatever that is
[07:24] for anyone you start to
[07:26] realize okay nothing else matters it's
[07:28] Bitcoin only and then you know the rest
[07:30] is history it's um it's been an amazing
[07:33] couple of years and I guess that's the
[07:36] journey thus far I love your journey you
[07:39] also told me this last time when we met
[07:42] and I was like I I have to share the
[07:44] story also with other people and did did
[07:48] this the seeing the Bitcoin price going
[07:51] up that far from the first time you
[07:53] heard about it then then you grow then
[07:55] you got it and then with the AL coins
[07:58] did this motiv you even more than now
[08:01] make so many videos to meet so many
[08:03] Bitcoin minds and then actually
[08:05] educating a lot of people is that a
[08:08] motivation you have for for doing that
[08:11] extra work I I think the biggest
[08:14] motivation Robin is when you really
[08:17] start to understand the Distortion that
[08:19] the fed's gone down over the last 100
[08:22] 110 years how they've slowly but
[08:25] steadily systematically destroyed the
[08:28] fat currency the doar when we went off
[08:30] the gold standard it the debasement
[08:33] happened like World War I World War I
[08:35] started a couple of years after the Fed
[08:36] was
[08:38] created since then they've been slowly
[08:40] going down making the money worth less
[08:42] and less and less and everyone thinks
[08:44] you know it's still not everyone
[08:46] everyone most people are awake but a lot
[08:47] of people think it's still backed by
[08:49] something it's fear it's backed by
[08:50] decree it's backed by the power of
[08:53] military fear of imprisonment no
[08:55] intrinsic value a lot of people think it
[08:57] is but when you See Clearly how they've
[09:01] distorted people's reality because so
[09:03] many people spend their entire lives
[09:06] working for what they think is money
[09:08] it's only currency as they're working
[09:10] for currency they think they're saving I
[09:13] think Co was a really big wakeup call
[09:16] for everyone everything got they printed
[09:18] so much money everyone thought it was
[09:20] really good to get free money handed to
[09:21] them deposit into their bank accounts
[09:24] and then the price of everything
[09:25] skyrocketed the the people that already
[09:28] had large reserves of cash were already
[09:30] into hard assets gold Fine Art fine wine
[09:33] real estate things like that those
[09:35] property prices soar like our house was
[09:39] sideways for ages and price value on
[09:42] dollar terms we're not going to sell and
[09:44] it pretty much doubled like in in a
[09:46] matter of months you know within a year
[09:49] the price and it didn't do anything at
[09:51] all and it's still overvalued it should
[09:54] probably come down about 50% of the gain
[09:57] that it had like a couple of $1,000
[10:00] there but when you see that you realize
[10:04] okay like for the generation for for
[10:06] anyone for anyone that's Works their
[10:08] whole entire lives they've got a whole
[10:10] lot of money in the bank your parents my
[10:12] parents our grandparents or somebody our
[10:15] age Robin that's working so hard for
[10:18] this funny money
[10:19] realizing without realizing that they
[10:23] need to do something like everyone needs
[10:24] to become a sophisticated investor but
[10:27] basically until Bitcoin but they think
[10:30] because of the SOP operation choke point
[10:33] 2.0 the Distortion or the lies that have
[10:36] gone out there in regards to bitcoin has
[10:38] led people astray so I guess the purpose
[10:42] of the mission on to be able to get up
[10:44] every day and get get the signal out
[10:46] there as loud and as clear as possible
[10:49] is to realize for people to realize that
[10:52] something's not right and people feel
[10:55] that but they don't know what that is
[10:56] and then when they understand that it's
[10:57] the fiat currency
[10:59] then they start asking questions and the
[11:01] more times people hear about Bitcoin
[11:04] eventually they're going to be like Okay
[11:05] this not a tup bubble anymore it's not
[11:08] going away how do like what is it they
[11:12] start studying it even 10 hours of
[11:14] studying Bitcoin you're going to have a
[11:15] pretty good idea about how the world
[11:17] Works 100 hours probably better than you
[11:20] know 95% of the population as you exceed
[11:24] that people just really wake up and like
[11:26] okay I need to get as much of this as
[11:28] possible so while we are still so cheap
[11:32] you you know we're only at
[11:34] $44,000 Australian or 43,500 whatever it
[11:37] is at the time recording you not it
[11:39] fluctuates it's volatile doesn't mean
[11:41] it's
[11:42] risky but it's only at 800 something
[11:45] trillion dollar uh billion dollar market
[11:47] cap it's tiny it's absolutely small and
[11:50] it is the best form of money or asset
[11:53] that's ever been created so I guess
[11:55] that's the the drive impetus to be able
[11:57] to wake up show up every day day and
[11:59] allow people to keep their own
[12:01] conviction and get them to read the
[12:03] books because the agendas that are
[12:05] coming out 2030 oh nothing be happy eat
[12:07] the bugs that scares me man like I care
[12:11] for the fellow human being and you know
[12:14] like myself other people may hear about
[12:16] Bitcoin and then get scops with crypto
[12:19] and then they go down that crypto rabbit
[12:20] hole it's the the wrong way maybe if you
[12:23] hear about crypto and you come to
[12:25] bitcoin like my journey it ends well but
[12:27] for most people that hear Bitcoin then
[12:29] go down the crypto rabbit hole it's
[12:31] going to destroy them long term for most
[12:33] people there are sophisticated Traders
[12:35] out there that understand the markets
[12:37] that play it that's their profession
[12:39] profession but that's a price or a pay
[12:41] to play you know they've spent the money
[12:43] they've learned made the mistakes are in
[12:45] the markets every day for the average
[12:47] person I just want for for me and
[12:50] obviously it's not Financial advice but
[12:51] just to study Bitcoin as much as
[12:53] possible because it's just time time's
[12:56] all it takes to understand that this is
[12:58] unque Humanity's never seen it before
[13:01] and it as Nico Moran says from Simply
[13:03] Bitcoin it's Bitcoin or slavery like
[13:07] that's it there is no other option
[13:09] there's nothing else out there but for
[13:12] that people need to take 100% personal
[13:14] self responsibility for their thoughts
[13:17] or actions the information they consume
[13:20] and where they direct their time and
[13:21] their
[13:22] energy that's that's beautifully said um
[13:26] Bitcoin or slavery so how how will
[13:29] Bitcoin change the political landscape
[13:33] uh in the in the world maybe also in
[13:35] Australia I heard that in Australia was
[13:38] the the covid-19 um lockdowns really
[13:42] really heavily it's just something I
[13:45] heard when sitting in Europe I don't
[13:47] know how much is is true about that um
[13:50] what will change over the time when we
[13:53] are more and more on a Bitcoin standard
[13:55] uh the way of the government of printing
[13:59] the money and having this hidden tax to
[14:03] steal purchasing power of the people is
[14:06] not there anymore what what's are the
[14:08] major things that can change yeah a
[14:12] couple of things so in regards to c19
[14:14] where I live like I live in a a town
[14:16] there's about 20 30,000 people sort of
[14:18] the tail end of the Great Barrier Reef
[14:21] ow man and stuff was pretty good and
[14:24] didn't
[14:25] stop um like the didn't shut down where
[14:29] I
[14:30] live however that was very unique in
[14:33] Australia there's places like Melbourne
[14:36] and stuff where they they basically
[14:39] Barden the military police to be able to
[14:41] control people anyone listening to the
[14:44] mainstream news got totally again I use
[14:47] the word scops they got totally misled
[14:49] or programmed to be able to think and
[14:51] act a certain way and it destroyed
[14:53] people's lives not in the way like a lot
[14:57] of people uh got jobkeeper or some typee
[15:00] of allowance so they could keep living
[15:02] but when everyone gets so isolated and
[15:04] you can't see friends and family or
[15:05] every time anyone coughs or sneezes
[15:08] naturally you get that fear that you're
[15:10] going to catch this deadly disease
[15:12] that we won't go into it too deeply but
[15:16] when they put that level of fear into
[15:19] people then people become so isolated
[15:22] and the mental health and the fear
[15:23] that's going on and you still see it
[15:25] today Robin those people are more so a
[15:29] shell of who they used to be they're not
[15:31] as strong within themselves mentally or
[15:35] psychologically as what they
[15:38] were uh so that's through the money
[15:41] printing locking away the totalitarian
[15:44] regime that happened that was through
[15:46] c19 in regards to bitcoin how's it
[15:49] changed the Australian monetary system
[15:52] the world monetary system the one thing
[15:55] people need to understand is War's never
[15:56] going away there's always going to be
[15:57] Wars people like I think in the last
[15:59] 2,000 years planet earth has been at
[16:02] peace about 10 years out of 2,000 and
[16:05] not for 10 years all at once you know
[16:07] maybe a year here six months there so
[16:10] humans by Nature will continue to go to
[16:14] war but when they print so much
[16:16] money it allows these proxy wars to go
[16:19] on indefinitely and it's the people that
[16:22] own the shares and loed Martin or
[16:26] Boeing General Dynamics any any of these
[16:29] things that profit off War so it makes
[16:32] sense for them to print as much money
[16:34] for it to go to those companies for the
[16:36] stockholders to be able to make money
[16:38] that's just one one area obviously the
[16:40] cantillon affects those closest to the
[16:42] money printer when it destroys the rest
[16:45] of people so
[16:48] say someone's starting out they just
[16:51] bought a house they could just afford it
[16:54] and interest rates were pretty much 0%
[16:57] and the banks said hey you're you're 30
[17:00] years old you can have a million dollar
[17:02] mortgage and they're like yeah that's
[17:03] great I can afford it that's fantastic
[17:06] just and they can afford food and things
[17:08] their insurance everything like that but
[17:11] then as inflation kicks in then they
[17:13] jack up the interest rates the fastest
[17:14] time in human history all around the
[17:16] world then they can no longer make those
[17:18] repayments so the canones are the people
[17:21] closest that already have hard assets
[17:24] buy up all those hard hard assets and
[17:28] people are forced to rent and the wealth
[17:32] transfers that we see keep happening
[17:34] over and over again as we go through
[17:36] these boomman bus Cycles as and the
[17:39] money printer is basically what dictates
[17:43] that the more liquidity out there in the
[17:45] market the high like the stock markets
[17:48] at the alltime highs and the world's
[17:49] pretty much in a recession really and
[17:52] inflation they reckon it's close to 2%
[17:54] it's it's nowhere
[17:56] near I guess um as we go into a Bitcoin
[18:01] standard
[18:03] it they're not going to stop using Fiat
[18:07] money at least in the short term that's
[18:09] still going to be around as a medium of
[18:11] exchange not a store of value but if
[18:14] they have a peg say for like simple math
[18:16] like 50% Bitcoin to to every dollar
[18:20] that's out there whatever it is every
[18:22] $100 or whatever it's pegged to bitcoin
[18:25] they can only print so much they need to
[18:27] be so careful with the outs where they
[18:29] spend their money where they put that
[18:31] Capital they can't just go around like
[18:33] say end of tax year we see like a lot of
[18:37] new Pathways and not a lot of new roads
[18:40] being resurfaced and stuff because
[18:42] governments need to spend that
[18:45] money for for a couple of reasons one to
[18:47] to be seen that they're doing things but
[18:49] also if they don't spend the money
[18:50] they're going to get less next year and
[18:52] no government wants that to happen to
[18:55] them if we're on a Bitcoin standard
[18:57] they're more lik to hold on to those
[19:01] cash reserves as they're going to
[19:02] appreciate over time but it's like a a
[19:06] check that they can no longer continue
[19:10] just to to go every everywhere okay the
[19:12] money is free we'll just do whatever we
[19:14] can it slows all that down same with
[19:17] Wars yes we need to go to war maybe we
[19:20] need to raise bonds from like the
[19:23] Australian population the US population
[19:26] where wherever it is but those Wars are
[19:29] only going to last until the people like
[19:31] all right you've achieved your mission
[19:32] you've stopped andless money printing
[19:35] they don't even need to say anything
[19:37] they don't need any permission they'll
[19:38] just keep prining the money keep prining
[19:40] the money keep prining the money and it
[19:42] just
[19:43] destroys human civilization really so I
[19:46] guess where Bitcoin and I'm wearing the
[19:49] the Bitcoin as hope shirt today where
[19:51] Bitcoin gives us hope is it makes them
[19:54] accountable for every single action
[19:56] every single decision it's like for
[19:59] people that are employed and the boss
[20:01] says I don't know go out and buy I don't
[20:05] know a box of paper or whatever silly
[20:06] example but say a box of paper the guy
[20:09] goes out company credit card they'll
[20:10] just grab the first box there they're
[20:12] not looking for for the highest quality
[20:14] paper they're just listening the sales
[20:16] agent just sells them whatever or the
[20:19] most amounts of sheets for paper they
[20:22] just don't care because it's not their
[20:23] money it's easy money they going there
[20:25] get a task and then move on to the next
[20:28] whereas on a Bitcoin standard the boss
[20:31] says we need the cheapest highest
[20:34] quality paper that you can get and we
[20:36] need a thousand RS or
[20:38] whatever within that box and then people
[20:41] are going to think through their actions
[20:44] a whole lot more it's going to come down
[20:45] to the individual level businesses State
[20:48] local governments and worldwide that's
[20:51] how I see Bitcoin changing things in
[20:54] regards to Wars and stuff though people
[20:56] need to realize they're not going to go
[20:57] away they're just it's not going to last
[20:59] as long and it's going to keep people
[21:02] more accountable if your government's
[21:04] overspending the people are going to see
[21:06] that they're going to realize that you
[21:08] know Australia is one of the highest tax
[21:09] countries in the world but they're going
[21:11] to
[21:12] see okay or all this money why are we
[21:15] paying tax when they can just print an
[21:17] endless amounts of money whereas if
[21:19] they've got a certain amount of money
[21:22] and it's increasing each year or maybe
[21:24] it doesn't maybe we just get to a point
[21:26] where Bitcoin flatlines that's a far
[21:27] away into the future it depends what
[21:29] time frame we're looking
[21:30] at if that happens people are more
[21:35] responsible and they're more accountable
[21:36] so I I guess on a Bitcoin standard that
[21:39] uh that saying or that mem you can't
[21:41] change Bitcoin but Bitcoin changes you
[21:43] that happens on an individual level
[21:46] Corporation level a local state
[21:48] government level and a global level yeah
[21:51] I'm I'm also curious the proof of work
[21:54] mindset because I see it when I speak
[21:56] with Bitcoin as I see it when when by
[21:58] myself I see it by so many people that
[22:01] went into Bitcoin uh and the previous
[22:04] life it just like when they discovered
[22:07] Bitcoin fully and they grasp it they
[22:08] make some change like that there is
[22:10] something happening uh in their minds
[22:14] and in their lives it's it's does not
[22:17] matter if the person is 25 or 30 or the
[22:20] person is 40 or 45 um I spoke with uh
[22:25] either one of those groups and
[22:28] how can like what will change in the in
[22:33] the Bitcoin landscape maybe more in the
[22:35] near-term future when we have next year
[22:38] a possible Bitcoin spot ETF we have
[22:41] havening we have um maybe more price
[22:45] action next year what do you see
[22:47] happening in the near future with all
[22:51] the I I feel I kind of feel like it's a
[22:54] perfect storm next year that could come
[22:57] for for for Bitcoin do do you see
[22:59] similar things yeah obviously uh Robin
[23:03] like nothing's certain even the
[23:05] Bloomberg and alysis are only putting
[23:06] out a 90% certainty that we get the ETF
[23:09] in
[23:11] January and people like like what about
[23:13] that other
[23:14] 10% if it's a 90% better that's pretty
[23:17] bloody good but everything you just said
[23:20] so say all the spot Bitcoin ETFs get
[23:23] approved at once we have the Haring the
[23:26] interest rates come down they need to
[23:27] start printing money because of the US
[23:30] presidential election all these
[23:33] catalysts com in the amount of
[23:35] liquidity on top of all the marketing
[23:37] we're starting to see it already like
[23:40] bitwise like I won't be holding the ETF
[23:42] I just will not be holding the Bitcoin
[23:44] ETF it's Bitcoin and self custody only
[23:46] if you take away one thing ladies and
[23:47] gentlemen hold Bitcoin self custody do
[23:50] not keep your seed on paper put it on
[23:53] steel at least with titanium's even
[23:56] better but people are going to race to
[23:59] be able to
[24:01] have like hundreds of millions of
[24:03] dollars is going to flow just into
[24:04] Bitcoin marketing alone I think we've
[24:07] seen this war and especially like
[24:09] operation choke point 2.0 and what's
[24:12] happening with sen Elizabeth Warren and
[24:14] Jamie demon those things that are
[24:16] happening there are
[24:19] um well they're interesting but now that
[24:22] black rock tapped gendler on the
[24:24] shoulder and said hey like I'm ready to
[24:26] go for a spot Bitcoin ETF he needs to
[24:28] backtrack a little bit and he is
[24:30] starting to change his tune even when we
[24:32] saw that last video of him on mainstream
[24:35] news he's like oh yeah the court sort of
[24:38] said we need to revisit again and he
[24:40] sort of had a little bit of a laugh
[24:42] there with it like okay like he's trying
[24:45] to make light of the situation he's been
[24:47] for me I think Gary's been paid to delay
[24:50] but now black Rock's ready it's like
[24:53] okay we need
[24:55] to look like there's a reason that we
[24:57] said said no in the first place he he's
[25:00] done that pretty effectively as we get
[25:02] all these catalysts now it's really
[25:05] going to be the marketing and people
[25:07] like bitwise Black Rock vanck Arvest
[25:11] everyone coming together and being like
[25:13] actuallyit like Larry think Bitcoin is
[25:17] is is Hope or or Bitcoin is digital gold
[25:20] the words coming out of Larry think's
[25:22] mouth love him or hate him I don't like
[25:24] him ladies and gentlemen not in the
[25:25] slightest but absolutely insane because
[25:28] so many people look up and respect Black
[25:30] Rock runs the world like by GDP the US
[25:34] and China are in front of him and then
[25:37] black rock is the largest corporation in
[25:38] the world with assets under management
[25:41] he has an immense amount of power and
[25:44] people believe in him for whatever
[25:46] reason they don't see the harm I guess
[25:49] they're doing but having those markets
[25:52] open up the US market open up alongside
[25:55] everything that you just mentioned with
[25:56] the money printing that the Haring the
[25:59] US Cycles H US presidential election and
[26:02] then dropping the interest rates I think
[26:04] it's going to be like something that
[26:06] we've never seen before you know often
[26:09] on my channel I talk about 10 $20,000
[26:11] candles both to the up and the downside
[26:14] Max in some countries that will happen
[26:16] in US dollar terms I'm not so
[26:19] certain more so now than ever though
[26:22] it's a possibility it was never possible
[26:24] before we you know in Bitcoin for a long
[26:27] time then tions are com in the cycle the
[26:29] institutions are come in the cycle never
[26:31] happen never happen and now it's
[26:32] actually game time so we'll see worst
[26:35] case scenario January passes they
[26:37] decline it for whatever reason and then
[26:40] we get an approval in March that still
[26:42] lines up right before the Haring and in
[26:44] line with everything else so that may be
[26:49] uh an opportunity there to be able to
[26:51] stack some SATs you know my opinion is
[26:53] people should be stacking when they can
[26:55] stack SATs and uh just chill enjoy the
[26:58] ride but it's going to
[27:00] be I I think it's going to be insane
[27:03] like both in a good way and a bad way a
[27:05] lot of people are going to get scared
[27:07] like on my Channel all the time I say
[27:09] push the um the red button when we
[27:12] see if I can oh it's not going there but
[27:16] on uh coin 360 when bitcoin's R if you
[27:20] push that and you get ready for it
[27:21] psychologically you're not going to be
[27:23] shaking out by 10 20,000 $30,000 dips to
[27:26] the downside you realize okay this is
[27:29] just part of it shorts are liquidated
[27:31] Longs are liquidated we can reset and
[27:32] then we can St step back up the year
[27:35] again so that's sort of what I see
[27:38] happening Robin is it's going to get
[27:40] very volatile very quickly once the ETF
[27:43] starts trading once it's approved there
[27:46] could be a six week Gap up to a six week
[27:48] Gap do we see a dip there maybe but I
[27:53] think that's when the marketing really
[27:54] starts ramping up we're seeing a little
[27:56] bit now I think we're going to to get
[27:57] more and more and more of that
[28:00] especially once the SEC says okay in 6
[28:02] weeks you can start selling your ETF
[28:05] they're just going to be like okay it's
[28:07] game time let's go and people are going
[28:09] to wake up to the fact that Bitcoin is
[28:12] no longer magic internet money it is the
[28:15] best performing asset in human history
[28:16] it's the best asset to ever exist the
[28:18] first time digital scarcity has ever
[28:21] existed when we have all these things
[28:23] there Bitcoins digital gold whatever
[28:25] narrative they push we're going to have
[28:28] the largest institutions in the world
[28:31] marketing Bitcoin for us so I think
[28:33] fireworks
[28:34] man when there's this uh famous saying
[28:38] uh they first laugh at you then they
[28:40] join you then you win and and stuff like
[28:42] that um when you see Larry think saying
[28:45] Bitcoin is a flight quality when you see
[28:49] ETF coming to to uh realization when you
[28:53] see all the positive things also in the
[28:55] mainstream media kind of happening
[28:58] slowly and slowly are we in the then did
[29:02] join you
[29:03] part yes and no uh obviously Senator
[29:07] Elizabeth baren and Jamie demon again
[29:11] are and then they fight you stage still
[29:14] and that's going to ramp up even more
[29:16] they're going to get so noisy
[29:19] because I don't know if they realize or
[29:21] not they think they can stop Bitcoin
[29:23] there's no stopping Bitcoin you can't
[29:25] stop Bitcoin you can just stop yourself
[29:27] from using Bitcoin I don't know if they
[29:29] know that yet I have a feeling they sort
[29:31] of do but they're scared shirtless so
[29:33] they're doing everything they can to be
[29:35] able to prevent it delay it to be able
[29:37] to keep control of their broken money
[29:40] system because once people take self-
[29:43] custody of Bitcoin they're their own
[29:44] bank they have they become a self-
[29:46] sovereign individual so we're going to
[29:48] see this dramatically increase and I
[29:52] guess one sad thing is if somebody says
[29:56] something bad to you you hear it
[29:58] straight away and it sticks with you all
[29:59] day so fear is a heavier emotion it's a
[30:02] base emotion it just has more weight to
[30:05] it or more residents and you'll carry
[30:07] that with you whereas so they're coming
[30:10] from the faar side people like Senator
[30:12] Elizabeth Warr and Jamie demon that's
[30:14] the fear side of things then we have
[30:16] Larry f Bitcoin is a flight to Quality
[30:19] along with Kathy Wood everyone else
[30:21] Michael sailor you know this the
[30:22] greatest thing in the world but you need
[30:24] to hear that three or four times more
[30:28] minimum for it to stick with you as much
[30:32] but then a little bit of fear will just
[30:33] knock that out and then you're back into
[30:34] fear again and I think they're going to
[30:38] have to get really noisy I guess with
[30:42] uh the the fear side of things they do
[30:45] have access to all the mainstream media
[30:48] networks and stuff but it is starting to
[30:50] change what Elon Musk is doing like what
[30:52] what a goat man like Elon Musk is just
[30:55] one of these great amazing people um
[30:59] like that saying you're trying to bribe
[31:01] me with money me with money go [ __ ]
[31:04] yourself Bob like like the greatest man
[31:08] and oh
[31:09] man so and the people like taka Carlson
[31:14] and everyone else love them or hate them
[31:15] even Alex Jones one of the most
[31:17] controversial figures in the world being
[31:20] able to come over text and then most
[31:22] people are starting to wake up realize
[31:25] okay why are these people in silence
[31:27] what are they trying to control because
[31:29] the more they try to shut it down truth
[31:31] will always Prevail it's harder but for
[31:35] people that are spooking fear they're
[31:37] living in fear as well so they're going
[31:39] to lose energy over time and truth will
[31:41] set you free you know the light will
[31:43] always
[31:44] shine so maybe it's a little bit dark
[31:47] before the dawn but once that light
[31:49] comes out I think that catalyst is going
[31:52] to come in there quickly I know that's a
[31:54] little bit off tangent but I guess that
[31:58] that's what I see and then I so take the
[32:00] good side the light side for an example
[32:02] the hundreds of millions of dollars that
[32:04] are coming in to Market Bitcoin it's
[32:07] going to be over the Super Bowl it's
[32:09] going to be before every type of
[32:11] financial YouTube ad so so I've got a a
[32:15] Bitcoin YouTube channel they're going to
[32:17] play their ad before my video during the
[32:20] video after my video they're going to
[32:21] have it in the sidebar every time you go
[32:24] and Google if you're looking at houses
[32:26] best store of value if you're looking at
[32:28] Gold best store of value Bitcoin Bitcoin
[32:30] Bitcoin Bitcoin it's going to go
[32:31] everywhere it's going to be on
[32:32] billboards probably the Super Bowl like
[32:34] I was saying people need to see it over
[32:37] you know an advertisement nine times
[32:39] before it sticks and then they need to
[32:42] realize okay like I've seen that the
[32:44] Bitcoin symbol but until they know that
[32:47] Bitcoin fixes their problem so it'll
[32:50] probably take it a little while because
[32:53] we need to uncover or unpack all that
[32:55] propaganda programming
[32:57] but it's happening because there's so
[33:00] much money to be made from people like
[33:02] Black Rock and stuff I'm not saying
[33:04] they're good all I'm saying is they're
[33:06] good for Bitcoin adoption and price my
[33:09] only hope is people like yourself get
[33:11] the signal out here you need to hold it
[33:13] in self- custody not your keys not your
[33:15] coins that's hard that's scary for some
[33:17] people that there's people out there
[33:19] like the Bitcoin way for example you've
[33:22] interviewed Tony as well here on your
[33:25] podcast they can help especially the
[33:27] older generation become their own
[33:29] sovereign individual because it's a bit
[33:31] of a steep learning curve but people may
[33:34] get into the ETF and they realize okay
[33:37] this is hope this is safety this is my
[33:39] my life here that is on the line and
[33:42] then somebody says hey you know holding
[33:45] the ETF is you're you're still a slave
[33:48] to the system like no what do you mean
[33:50] like I'm not a slave I've got the I'm
[33:51] holding Bitcoin no you're actually not
[33:53] holding Bitcoin you're holding paper
[33:54] Bitcoin and they'll probably get really
[33:56] angry and they'll be like what do you
[33:58] mean and some of them will listen and be
[34:01] like Oh self self custody what's that
[34:04] and then they start asking questions
[34:05] they're curious I think that will take
[34:10] the longest people are probably going to
[34:11] flock into these ETFs once the the
[34:15] marketing kicks in and starts resonating
[34:18] then maybe it's another one or two
[34:20] cycles before people realize okay I've
[34:23] got the ETF this is Bitcoin it goes up
[34:25] forever Laura that's great fantastic
[34:27] fastic and then they realize oh but I'm
[34:30] actually not self- sovereign well how do
[34:31] I become self- sovereign for a select
[34:34] group of people they will come over to
[34:35] the world's hardest asset hold and cold
[34:37] storage and the more people that do that
[34:40] like the 100 monkeys once that starts
[34:43] happening we have that Catalyst effect
[34:46] and that's how Bitcoin wins longterm I
[34:49] guess and I I'll I'll stop very shortly
[34:52] but I guess the biggest thing is not
[34:54] everything that's going to happen in
[34:55] 2024 26 you know maybe
[34:59] 2032 two more Haring from now it doesn't
[35:03] matter like if you're here now if you're
[35:04] stacking now you shouldn't be thinking
[35:06] about making dirty odd fed like I don't
[35:08] know how to set in any other way like it
[35:11] it's trash it's absolutely trash if
[35:14] you've got the hardest asset now all you
[35:16] need to do is stack chill at least for
[35:18] me you you
[35:20] know and then say 2032
[35:25] onwards the laws they may get worse for
[35:27] a while then we'll get a younger
[35:29] generation into power and be like this
[35:31] is absolute BS like executive order 6102
[35:35] took a long time for people not to be
[35:36] able to hold their own gold now they can
[35:38] hold their own gold again that could
[35:40] definitely happen so people just need to
[35:44] like zoom out you know when in doubt
[35:45] zoom out and realize okay yes they may
[35:49] get noisy it's going to be both sides
[35:51] the good and the bad but Bitcoin is hope
[35:54] it is that freedom you just need to
[35:56] realize it may not happen in 2024 but
[36:00] 2024 and even what we're seeing now is
[36:03] going to be the start of that snow
[36:05] snowball that rolls downhill amazing you
[36:08] mentioned self codyy and Tony from the
[36:11] bitco away um I actually have him back
[36:14] on next uh next week and there is a good
[36:18] reason for that um do you know Rick also
[36:21] who joined the Bitcoin way who lost the
[36:23] 25 Bitcoin yeah I I heard it story man
[36:27] yeah yeah and he joined the bit convey
[36:30] now and I saw it and I was like hey you
[36:32] want to jump on the podcast and he said
[36:34] yes and we're now making a podcast where
[36:37] he is sharing his story and also Tony is
[36:41] is is joining and I want to make one
[36:45] video where I can send Bitcoin send uh
[36:49] people there to learn about self-
[36:51] custody and the first steps into self
[36:53] custody and I think the the story with
[36:57] Rick and the expertise with Tony I think
[37:00] it will be great I just just had it in
[37:02] my mind you also mentioned El musk on X
[37:06] and I think it's it's a it's a
[37:09] interesting topic because El musk is
[37:11] still uh hated from some bitcoiners
[37:15] because of the of his action but he is
[37:17] one of the richest men's alive and he is
[37:22] into Bitcoin that's for me it's 100%
[37:25] clear of course
[37:27] maybe as a content creator like I know
[37:29] I'm uploading my videos on X and on
[37:32] YouTube and I noticed that uh it's way
[37:37] faster on X because there is no
[37:39] processing I don't know what YouTube
[37:41] does with the video after it it uploads
[37:44] and it processes but it's like I need
[37:48] like an hour less uh on on on X because
[37:51] it's uh really fast and it just feels
[37:54] that there is no fil on x
[37:57] um it's just my subjective feeling I
[37:59] don't know what's really going on um
[38:02] where do you see uh the the future of
[38:06] social media going with X with Nostra
[38:09] with YouTube uh yourself are content
[38:12] creator on on those platforms on both of
[38:15] them um what's your thoughts around IL
[38:18] musk X future of social media yeah
[38:21] interesting so uh one of the lead
[38:23] Developers for canva um you know lives
[38:27] next door so he came around uh yesterday
[38:30] afternoon and we were sort of having a
[38:31] chat about Tik Tok YouTube social media
[38:34] as well so very recent uh
[38:37] conversation Elon Musk is building the
[38:40] everything cap you know he said we've
[38:42] seen those videos where let's just copy
[38:44] WeChat you know like WeChat is the
[38:46] everything G in uh in China there it's
[38:50] like let's just copy it and then they're
[38:52] going to improve on that and
[38:55] iterate what Elon Musk is doing is
[38:58] giving a voice to it's not perfect man
[39:01] like his free speech is not perfect it's
[39:03] still like in my feed in my for you I
[39:08] will hardly ever see someone that does
[39:10] not have a blue check mark like very
[39:12] rarely like maybe one out of 20 posts in
[39:16] a row will be someone without a blue
[39:18] check mark so it's pay to play it's not
[39:20] free Free Speech but if you get that
[39:23] check mark and you pay to play you're
[39:25] allowed to pretty say whatever you want
[39:28] you know as long as it's not a hate
[39:30] crime and even that's a little bit loose
[39:34] you know like I know I've been pretty
[39:35] nasty towards Elizabeth Warren in the
[39:37] past I'm sorry I'm not sorry there um
[39:40] because she's an evil [ __ ] but um I
[39:43] think people are going to realize oh
[39:45] like Tucker's back Tate's
[39:48] back um Alex Jones is back and whatever
[39:53] people think with them it doesn't matter
[39:54] if we agree or not they should be two
[39:57] sides of the conversation like say is
[40:00] Bitcoin going to pump or is it going to
[40:01] dump no it's never going to dump like
[40:04] hang on like let's let's take a moment
[40:06] let's think of both sides and see
[40:07] everything from every angle so instead
[40:09] of people are going to realize that
[40:13] freedom is pretty important it's been
[40:15] controlled for so long even Elizabeth
[40:17] waren saying there's billionaires out
[40:19] there and they control media and things
[40:21] like that talking about Elon Musk making
[40:23] it too free for people so do see X as
[40:27] winning totally like today I called uh
[40:32] Mike shout out to Mike today on Twitter
[40:34] and it's the first time I'd ever used
[40:37] Twitter for calling somebody the phone
[40:39] feature and it was amazing like even
[40:41] from the ringtone like the ringing that
[40:43] happens was the nicest ringtone that
[40:46] I've ever heard while waiting for the
[40:48] phone to dial the dial tone um and
[40:51] because he's
[40:52] so like OCD he's he's operating at such
[40:56] a high level I think like we we want him
[41:00] to bring back Bitcoin straight away you
[41:02] know it's not going to happen he's
[41:04] fighting all these Wars all these fires
[41:06] it's going to be
[41:07] slowly then what happens with the other
[41:10] platforms well when Tik Tok came out
[41:13] then YouTube started putting out short
[41:15] form videos and then they're like all
[41:18] right we're really not making that much
[41:20] money from these where's our Niche and
[41:23] ultimately Bitcoin is still long form
[41:25] videos but they have changed their
[41:27] algorithms and stuff to be able to keep
[41:29] up with Tik Tok and even myself I find
[41:31] you know I'll listen like I just listen
[41:34] on YouTube but very rarely do I ever
[41:36] watch a YouTube video I um pay to be
[41:39] able to play I have YouTube premium put
[41:41] it in listen to it but say I just want
[41:45] to chill out or or whatever which I
[41:48] don't know when you're engaged I don't
[41:50] really find any need to be able to
[41:52] escape or whatever but I listen to
[41:54] something about Tesla I talking about
[41:56] the numbers 369 or whatever being the
[41:58] code to the universe and then there'll
[42:01] be a short about that video I'll watch
[42:03] that short and then it'll give me
[42:05] another short that's along a similar
[42:07] trajectory and I'll go through and I'll
[42:09] watch a couple of those I'm like okay
[42:11] like I've gone in a totally different
[42:13] direction but out of those last three or
[42:15] four shorts that I've watched I've
[42:17] enjoyed that topic let me go back into a
[42:20] long form side of things
[42:23] so we're already seeing it at adapting
[42:27] does YouTube keep up with Twitter is
[42:30] something that I think about a lot I
[42:32] guess it's why I post on on both places
[42:35] the interaction on
[42:39] Twitter with people that you don't know
[42:43] is better like within on Twitter you can
[42:45] reach out to nearly anyone in the world
[42:48] pretty much um who whoever you want you
[42:50] know on YouTube for example I guess like
[42:55] for myself and I can only speak for
[42:56] myself in my comment section when you're
[42:59] having like a a subscriber base that's
[43:02] really solid and they're freaking
[43:04] amazing like I want to shout out to
[43:05] everyone that has subscribed and you
[43:07] have these these comments and you know
[43:09] them by name you sort of got this little
[43:11] like back and forth that happens every
[43:13] day I think it's probably deeper but
[43:17] does that start happening on Twitter
[43:20] more and more like I I guess like on
[43:22] Twitter you put out a post pretty much
[43:24] like every post of your that I see I
[43:27] share them nearly every day one of your
[43:29] posts on the news you know they they
[43:31] always come up but I may not comment as
[43:35] much on Twitter whereas I think on
[43:38] YouTube you probably get the the
[43:40] community interaction a little bit more
[43:42] at this stage Tik Tok um aop it's just a
[43:47] disease for the brain you know what they
[43:49] show people here in the west is
[43:53] literally there to be able to distract
[43:55] them to be able to dumb him down
[43:57] hopefully people start waking up and
[43:59] they don't get sucked in too much for it
[44:01] but I don't really give Tik Tok any
[44:03] thought because I think it's destruction
[44:05] to society nosto what Jack dors is doing
[44:08] absolutely fantastic it just doesn't
[44:11] have the user base there like you go on
[44:15] I got got an Oster
[44:17] and I don't know just hardly ever use it
[44:20] same with Rumble my videos automatically
[44:23] upload to rumble but I don't go there
[44:26] because hardly anyone's there everyone's
[44:28] either on YouTube or they're on Twitter
[44:31] and most people like yourself you're on
[44:32] YouTube and Twitter I'm on YouTube and
[44:34] Twitter and I think those two in tangum
[44:40] Tandem and so like when I I stream it
[44:43] stream
[44:45] separately but you'll just be able to
[44:47] play the YouTube videos on on Twitter
[44:50] they're just going to be embedded and
[44:51] you're going to be able to watch them go
[44:52] full screen listen to it have in your
[44:54] pocket or or whatever and that could be
[44:58] the way that Twitter just takes total
[45:01] market share but then YouTube's going to
[45:04] try fight back as well you know we got
[45:06] community posts and things like that so
[45:08] they'll probably be in lock step
[45:09] together which will ultimately be
[45:11] beneficial definitely more freedom on
[45:14] places
[45:15] like um sorry YouTube but there are more
[45:19] there's more freedom on Twitter or or
[45:21] Rumble but if we've got a message and
[45:25] bitcoin's the most most important
[45:26] message especially now in this time of
[45:29] humanity if I need to limit myself
[45:31] especially in the first couple of
[45:32] minutes of my video and not swear I will
[45:36] so that people so the video gets out to
[45:40] people and then I can more naturally be
[45:41] myself certain things maybe you need to
[45:43] skirt around but ultimately what's the
[45:46] mission to say what I want or to be able
[45:49] to speak the truth as clear clearly as I
[45:54] can that I believe in to be able to get
[45:55] the message out to as many people and if
[45:58] I have to self sensor a little bit I
[46:01] will because ultimately it's not about
[46:04] me it's it's not about you it's about
[46:06] all of us the humanity people that have
[46:08] been kept and are continuing to be
[46:10] programmed and that slave mindset so
[46:13] that's a very long-winded way but
[46:16] probably YouTube and Twitter are going
[46:18] to grow together probably going to see a
[46:20] little bit more freedom on X the rest of
[46:23] it if you're on Twitter ladies and
[46:24] Gentlemen please get off it straight
[46:26] away it's not good yeah Tik Tok is
[46:29] definitely a mind virus I myself
[46:32] distribute all the short form videos
[46:35] also to Tik Tok and Instagram just uh
[46:38] because it's from my scheduling tool
[46:41] possibility I don't have the app
[46:43] installed but I was like if I can just
[46:45] post it I yeah might contribute to a
[46:50] slightly better Tik Tok experience maybe
[46:53] some of the people that watch one of the
[46:55] videos one of the clips and might wake
[46:58] them up uh but personally I'm I think
[47:02] 98% of my time on on uh x uh community
[47:07] and um interacting with people YouTube I
[47:11] love for the long firm uh format I love
[47:14] watching podcast I love watching uh long
[47:17] form videos diving deep into topics like
[47:19] YouTube is an amazing platform uh and
[47:22] it's also really high quality like uh
[47:26] like we also have to be clear X is so
[47:29] much smaller than YouTube also from a
[47:31] user base from a from an um from a
[47:35] channel point of view and I I just love
[47:38] act from the community I think maybe on
[47:41] a Bitcoin Community note only maybe X is
[47:45] even bigger I don't know no definitely
[47:48] yeah every Bitcoin I speak they are all
[47:51] on on on on on X but in general sense
[47:54] YouTube is still way bigger and if Axe
[47:57] actually wants to compete with YouTube
[47:59] on the long form videos they have to
[48:02] bring so many features still like watch
[48:04] later like uh saving the videos and an
[48:07] own video tab for for a but I think
[48:10] those things will come and then I will
[48:13] it will be interesting to see um so you
[48:16] are you're really active on X on on
[48:19] YouTube with uh I think daily live
[48:22] streams are you doing it daily yeah so
[48:25] live streams Monday to Friday Australian
[48:27] time which is probably uh Sunday to
[48:29] Thursday for people in the US um you
[48:33] know or on the that side of the world
[48:35] that time zone and then I'll get a
[48:37] podcast out pretty much every uh
[48:39] Saturday my time so sort of there'll be
[48:41] a video from Sunday to Friday there's
[48:45] sort of one day off there but that that
[48:48] podcast is you know something that I'd
[48:51] uh do now in the you know I'd film that
[48:55] during the week
[48:56] get it edited not that I'm really
[48:58] editing that much anymore uh just find a
[49:02] couple of Clips play them at the start
[49:04] and then get that out to to people just
[49:07] as
[49:08] the like You' know when you interview
[49:11] someone you you'll listen back to it
[49:13] yourself and you'll be like oh yeah
[49:15] that's a cool conversation they'll say
[49:17] that one thing you're like whoa like
[49:19] people need to hear this like you want
[49:21] to put that at the start of the
[49:23] video and then you just let the
[49:26] conversation roll you know that's that's
[49:28] me and um yeah so I guess six days a
[49:32] week content's coming out but I go live
[49:35] you know Monday to to Friday for me um
[49:39] every day and get out that's amazing and
[49:42] I also saw that you have actually a lot
[49:44] of bright people also on the podcast I
[49:47] saw Nat Pell Jason meire Greg f a lot of
[49:50] other people that I really respect in
[49:53] the Bitcoin
[49:54] community what did you learn like you
[49:58] you not immediately started making
[49:59] videos you first learned about uh the
[50:03] the Bitcoin and then after a while you
[50:05] started making videos um what did you
[50:08] learn while making those videos from
[50:11] those uh Bitcoin Minds you interviewed
[50:14] and maybe was what what was the key
[50:16] takeaways from from from
[50:19] them that it's I I guess one of the
[50:23] biggest things that's a really really
[50:24] good question
[50:26] because everyone that gets into Bitcoin
[50:28] gets into it for a different reason or
[50:30] they come from a different angle like
[50:32] Greg fos at some stages he trade up to a
[50:35] billion dollars a day very different
[50:37] from Natalie Brunell who is a
[50:39] traditional mainstream
[50:41] journalist uh so I guess the biggest
[50:44] takeaway is Bitcoin is inclusive of
[50:47] absolutely everyone male or female fat
[50:51] or thin whatever demographic you want to
[50:53] go out into and this so many different
[50:56] areas someone that's been in it for a
[50:58] very long time may like that it's
[51:02] immutable after a block like you're
[51:04] never going to change it again the
[51:05] resources behind it they may approach
[51:08] Bitcoin from the profitability or the
[51:10] nonprofit ability of mining depending on
[51:12] how they set it up whereas other people
[51:15] come in from a goldener investment
[51:17] background and understand scarce assets
[51:19] other people are just realizing they're
[51:22] not making it dayto day working their
[51:24] feat job
[51:25] and they don't even understand what the
[51:27] word fat
[51:28] means you know before they get into
[51:31] Bitcoin but once they get in that they
[51:32] realize okay this is why I was never
[51:34] getting ahead is because they can print
[51:36] so much of this money I guess that's
[51:39] probably the biggest takeaway is Bitcoin
[51:41] is inclusive for of absolutely every
[51:44] everyone and it's important for everyone
[51:47] and we say fix the money fix the world
[51:50] Bitcoin fixes this it's true and like I
[51:54] said it may not stop Wars but it'll stop
[51:56] me going on for as long or being
[52:00] profitable I yeah I'd say that would
[52:02] probably be the the biggest thing Robin
[52:06] is just how diverse and what
[52:10] circumstances like say Tony he's
[52:13] probably shared a little bit of his
[52:14] story with you with what happened in in
[52:18] Lebanon and and and stuff there like
[52:21] we're pretty pretty privileged like here
[52:23] in Australia like really priv you know
[52:26] even though I was very totalitarian for
[52:28] for
[52:30] c19 you know the roads are good the
[52:34] drinking water I wouldn't drink it but
[52:36] yeah you know it's just nice roads
[52:38] electricity like all all that stuff
[52:42] other people
[52:44] are really like living in very hard
[52:47] Economic Times like say in
[52:50] Australia if somebody doesn't want to
[52:52] work and you know
[52:55] which is a mine virus in themselves
[52:57] everyone should be using their capacity
[52:59] to be able to do something in the world
[53:01] but if they don't the government will
[53:03] give them enough money to be able to
[53:05] afford food
[53:07] clothing bloody alcohol or whatever
[53:10] their vices are like the government will
[53:12] give them enough money to be able to
[53:14] live at least a medeor ochre existence
[53:19] where other places in the world
[53:22] sometimes it doesn't matter how hard you
[53:24] work the government just shut the banks
[53:26] down overnight and you're like oh okay
[53:30] like like I'm stuffed here like what do
[53:32] I do and then they they come to bitcoin
[53:35] so I I guess that if that answers your
[53:39] question it's just so diverse and it's
[53:40] from everyone and talking to like some
[53:42] of the smartest brid mines in Bitcoin
[53:46] it's it doesn't matter where anyone
[53:48] wants to approach it from there'll be
[53:51] something that will get them interested
[53:53] we just need to find what they're
[53:54] interested in to be able to talk to them
[53:57] about that and they'll uh come into it
[54:00] and then they realize okay this is uh
[54:02] this is pretty important it's pretty re
[54:05] revolutionary technology yeah this this
[54:07] is also something I noticed uh for like
[54:10] you 30th guest and I always prepare
[54:12] questions and I always try to prepare
[54:14] question that is suited for the person
[54:17] but it actually would not be necessary
[54:19] to have interesting conversation because
[54:23] uh it's always such a un unque
[54:25] personality and they always have an
[54:27] unique perspective on things and I think
[54:30] if I just have the same I don't know 10
[54:33] questions for every podcast every
[54:35] podcast episode would be still watchable
[54:37] because there's some new things in there
[54:40] and it's a unique experience like I'm
[54:42] just starting out like 13 um interviews
[54:46] now uh I'm you're doing great bro
[54:48] they're bloody
[54:49] awesome thank you thank you for the uh
[54:53] I'm I'm looking forward to like when I'm
[54:55] hitting the 100 uh interview Milestone
[54:58] from the learnings there I'm I'm really
[55:01] looking forward to that um from as a
[55:05] content creator you are giving your face
[55:08] out a lot uh and as a bitcoiners we are
[55:10] always really cautious about privacy
[55:13] about kyc about all uh that kind of
[55:18] stuff how important is privacy for you
[55:21] or maybe to rephrase the questions why
[55:25] aren't you hiding because I know what
[55:27] I've done with my Bitcoin and where my
[55:29] Bitcoin is and how it's been looked
[55:30] after and Bitcoin is the most important
[55:33] thing for Humanity to be able to
[55:35] understand right now before it is too
[55:37] late so what would you like is KC
[55:42] something you are completely not doing
[55:47] with Bitcoin exchanges are you only
[55:48] buying peerto beer where there's no KC
[55:52] where do you fall on the I I'll stop
[55:55] there I won't go into it and so like I
[55:57] am ultimately very careful and very
[56:00] paranoid in what I do and do not say in
[56:02] regards to my Bitcoin stack because I do
[56:04] have my face out there for people I
[56:07] guess the conversation that I had with
[56:09] Tony they can go back and they can watch
[56:11] that episode for some people having kyc
[56:14] and non kyc is a good idea for other
[56:17] people having 100% no kyc Bitcoin is a
[56:20] good idea it's different and unique to
[56:23] every individual circumstance and I'm
[56:25] doing is not going to work for somebody
[56:26] else people need to figure out what it
[56:29] is that works for for them and I I know
[56:32] that's a little bit abrupt and it
[56:33] doesn't answer your question but I guess
[56:37] that's me because as a content
[56:41] creator you do need to be very careful
[56:44] with what you do and make sure
[56:45] everything is where it should be and
[56:48] should be protected the way it should be
[56:50] yeah totally fair and I think your
[56:53] answer is actually a really good answer
[56:56] for people to listen to because it just
[56:59] emphasizes how important is to to do the
[57:03] research them own their own like and do
[57:06] the hard work themselves like don't just
[57:08] like oh I heard that Sean said and this
[57:10] and this and this I should do then I do
[57:12] just this and this and this like I think
[57:14] the answer
[57:16] um mirrors the importance of the
[57:20] question absolutely I I think just
[57:22] jumping on to what you were saying there
[57:24] as well like I recommends Bitcoin
[57:26] sessions BTC sessions on YouTube and
[57:28] Twitter nearly every live stream he
[57:31] talks about the best hardware wallets
[57:33] what's good what's bad the only
[57:35] recommendation I'll make in regards to
[57:37] Hardware wallets is stay the [ __ ] away
[57:40] from Ledger what a disgrace of a company
[57:43] and it needs to be Bitcoin only it needs
[57:45] to be Bitcoin focused aside from that
[57:48] people need to go to to BTC sessions to
[57:51] be able to do that that's an expert in
[57:53] that field and he's Tau talking about
[57:55] everything he's not talking about so
[57:57] much what he's doing maybe with
[57:59] different little bits but you want to go
[58:03] to the right place with the right
[58:04] education or information and in regards
[58:07] to to protecting it your BTC sessions if
[58:10] someone needs help with their whole
[58:12] stack people like Tony from the Bitcoin
[58:14] way and stuff but the greatest thing
[58:18] about Bitcoin and people that have spent
[58:21] say like a minimum of 100 hours so much
[58:25] of that mine virus they've woken up from
[58:27] the Matrix they've taken that orange
[58:28] pill they realize oh if it's meant to be
[58:31] it's up to me oh and they're like oh
[58:34] [ __ ] this is scary I need to take 100%
[58:36] self- responsibility they don't want to
[58:38] do that but they realize okay the
[58:41] government's not going to save me my
[58:43] friends aren't going to save me my
[58:44] family's not going to save me my
[58:45] employment's not going to save me if
[58:47] it's meant to be it's up to me and
[58:50] Bitcoin forces that upon you so much and
[58:55] people will either put their head in the
[58:57] sand but if they've put in 100 hours
[59:00] they've at least got a little bit of
[59:01] drive to be able to unpack okay what is
[59:03] this thing how do I do it and they've
[59:06] probably been on bitcoin Twitter and
[59:08] they're they're hearing about GMOs and
[59:11] tap water and all the other little
[59:13] random things whether they agree with it
[59:16] or not it doesn't matter it just gets
[59:17] them to start questioning absolutely
[59:20] everything so I think that's that's very
[59:22] important and that's just natural and
[59:24] part of it but someone that comes to to
[59:28] you for advice you know every video say
[59:31] it's not Financial advice what is
[59:33] advisers study Bitcoin when they study
[59:35] Bitcoin they'll realize okay there's
[59:38] something important here I've uh you
[59:41] know for so long in my life when I told
[59:44] you when I heard about Bitcoin at
[59:46] $94 I wasn't taking responsibility for
[59:48] my life I was uh you know I was in a
[59:50] pretty bad way and I I blamed all my
[59:53] problems on the world around me and
[59:54] everyone everyone else and you know my
[59:56] mother my father my friends my family it
[59:58] was like there it was them it was they
[60:01] yes there's a distortion and stuff going
[60:03] on but the only way you can break
[60:04] through of it is to choose and act in a
[60:08] specific way where you can learn what is
[60:11] going on and then how to do it but
[60:13] ultimately it's that proof of work
[60:14] concept Robin it's um you know there's
[60:17] proof of Stak and stuff like you get
[60:20] something for nothing it's it's total BS
[60:22] and I think that's what the lesson that
[60:24] bit teaches
[60:26] people that's a it's a great line um
[60:30] what's what's for you next in the
[60:34] Bitcoin Community do you have uh to to
[60:36] wrap it uh slowly up the Bitcoin podcast
[60:39] do you have any things coming are you
[60:42] planning to might write a book are you
[60:45] planning to launch something something
[60:48] new or just keep going with six videos a
[60:51] week what amazing output actually
[60:55] yeah so I'll keep the the videos up
[60:57] absolutely for sure uh so there's a lot
[61:01] of great Bitcoin books you know Bitcoin
[61:03] evangelism beers for Bitcoin the fat
[61:05] standard the Bitcoin standard broken
[61:08] money you know and it goes on and on and
[61:11] on and on like amazing books I'd like to
[61:14] write probably not a book um but I am
[61:19] writing something and I don't really
[61:22] know how to explain it but when that
[61:24] comes out and say 12 or or you know 12
[61:27] to 18 months it's probably not going to
[61:29] be for Bitcoin is it's going to be
[61:32] something that a bitcoiner can hand to
[61:34] their friends and family because
[61:36] bitcoiners have already put in the proof
[61:38] work they're willing to read the books
[61:39] and stuff for someone I don't know if
[61:42] you've had this experience Robin but the
[61:45] Bitcoin standard I'd get the Bitcoin
[61:47] standard and be like hey like you need
[61:49] to read this one book this one book's
[61:50] going to change your life if somebody
[61:52] reads the Bitcoin stand front to back
[61:54] they're going to start questioning
[61:56] something at least they're just going to
[61:59] start asking a question and one question
[62:01] leads to another question and there's no
[62:03] such thing as a dumb question but I give
[62:06] him the Bitcoin standard and the next
[62:09] day the next week a month later they'd
[62:11] give it back to me and be like thanks
[62:13] very much I'm like how dod you go with
[62:14] it they're
[62:15] like it's too much for me I'm like it's
[62:18] it's one book bro like Ju Just you
[62:20] couldn't read one book to to potentially
[62:23] change your life they're like no man not
[62:25] not too too hard I'm like seriously
[62:28] because I've always been a big reader so
[62:30] it doesn't make any sense to me so then
[62:33] I'm like okay
[62:36] how because I still advocate for books
[62:38] you know so I'm like all right what book
[62:40] can I get out there what what can I give
[62:41] people so they just do one thing and now
[62:44] my go-to books and I've got them both
[62:46] here Bitcoin
[62:48] evangelism and beers for Bitcoin for
[62:51] someone that knows absolutely nothing be
[62:54] is for Bitcoin they can read it in a
[62:56] weekend it's just thck like it's tiny
[62:58] it's a centimeter thick it does not take
[63:00] long to read a slow reader maybe it
[63:02] takes them a month but it's pretty like
[63:05] it Sav you see Bitcoin it's broken down
[63:07] so simply one book once people start
[63:12] reading and they wake up a little bit
[63:15] then they ask a question then you give
[63:17] them another book and they're like okay
[63:20] and then they've put in 13 hours worth
[63:23] of work in there and started watching
[63:25] the podcast but for those people that
[63:28] aren't willing to
[63:31] spend that amount of time to read that
[63:35] book I want that one stepping stone
[63:37] before and I guess that's what I'm
[63:39] working on aside from my videos yeah oh
[63:43] great I'm looking forward to that um we
[63:46] having an end routine on the podcast
[63:48] where the previous guest asked a
[63:50] question for the next guest uh without
[63:52] knowing who the next guest actually
[63:54] actually is and the question I'm a
[63:57] little afraid that it will pop up a
[64:00] whole new topic and podcast will go on
[64:03] for another another hour but uh but ask
[64:08] it what will be the effects of cbdcs on
[64:13] bitcoin and how do what's your thoughts
[64:16] on cbdcs in
[64:17] general uh they're an evil tool by by
[64:21] their lead those in power at the moment
[64:25] they are coming there's nothing that we
[64:26] can do at people are trying and people
[64:30] actually doing really good work even
[64:32] Senator uh rondy Santos and stuff people
[64:36] are fighting against them so we're
[64:38] seeing that this agenda that's coming
[64:40] from the world economic Forum to have
[64:42] cbdcs by 2030 it's pretty scary um
[64:47] without going too
[64:50] deep when people are in cbdcs they
[64:54] really are going to be able to have an
[64:56] even higher level of control now if they
[64:58] want to and even today on my news I
[65:01] said cbdcs aren't going to come out and
[65:03] the next day they just switch off your
[65:05] bank account or prevent you buying
[65:07] gasoline or whatever but once they have
[65:10] the
[65:11] technology they will want to use it at
[65:13] some stage so I guess the biggest
[65:17] message is prepare as much as possible
[65:21] Now by stacking Bitcoin and that's why
[65:23] this time now in his is so important and
[65:26] maybe that for some people is to have
[65:28] kyc and non kyc Bitcoin for everybody
[65:31] that's listening it has to be Bitcoin in
[65:33] self- custody and that's how you fight
[65:36] against it we're still going to use
[65:38] bloody Monopoly money to go down to the
[65:41] shops at least in the short term is that
[65:43] Monopoly money cbdc or
[65:46] not it doesn't really matter it'll be
[65:49] what it'll be there are people even um
[65:53] Dennis Porter doing huge amount of work
[65:55] at the Satoshi action fund you know
[65:57] there are people fighting the good fight
[65:59] even V Ram Swami that's going for the US
[66:02] president people are fighting they're
[66:05] going to push it who wins oh fingers
[66:07] crossb it doesn't happen
[66:09] but say it does say there's only a 10%
[66:13] chance instead of a 90% chance of it
[66:15] happening wouldn't you still want to
[66:17] prepare yourself and it's it's it's
[66:20] Bitcoin ladies and Gentlemen Just stack
[66:22] and chill rent green days it really
[66:25] doesn't matter it's as Nico again says
[66:28] it's it's Bitcoin or slavery so I don't
[66:30] know fight the good fight silently up
[66:32] down and choose
[66:34] Freedom that's uh I think this is uh the
[66:39] best way to to end the podcast it was a
[66:42] real pleasure Sean to have you on uh you
