[00:00] you better book a place in in the
[00:01] Bitcoin Arc because the ocean is going
[00:03] to keep floating up and then Bitcoin is
[00:05] going to stay on top it's only 21
[00:06] million seats so you better book your
[00:08] place and a lot of those seats are
[00:09] already taken when have you seen an
[00:11] opportunity to be part of an elite
[00:12] there's going to be less whole coiners
[00:14] in the world than there are
[00:16] multi-millionaires if you account for
[00:18] all those lost coins for the whales
[00:20] there's like 3 million 4 million people
[00:21] that can realistically be whole coiners
[00:24] you're far ahead if you have a coin so
[00:25] get to 0.21 you know get to a a direct
[00:28] divisible of of Bitcoin and just climb
[00:30] your way up because the more you have is
[00:32] is going to be significant in the future
[00:34] the market cap compared to Global wealth
[00:36] it's still small there's still a lot to
[00:37] grow I just have that instrument to now
[00:40] throw it in my Bitcoin stash that is
[00:42] going to allow me to retire early
[00:43] there's no ex bitcoiners nobody that
[00:46] understands Bitcoin fully will reverse
[00:48] to a Fiat way of thinking just doesn't
[00:50] exist just before forward looking join
[00:52] the train join the arc get now to one
[00:55] Bitcoin before it's too late
[00:58] [Music]
[01:01] you told me uh your history is where
[01:04] your family wealth got eroded in
[01:07] Colombia like right now you are close to
[01:10] Miami uh Florida Fort laale you said if
[01:16] I remember correctly how was that
[01:18] happening for you and how did you then
[01:19] come to Miami right yeah so uh first of
[01:23] all we have to go back I would say 80 80
[01:26] years 80 to 100 years uh my my great
[01:30] grandpa owned a company of
[01:33] swimsuits and it was one of the leaders
[01:37] in the in Nationwide in
[01:40] Colombia and they sponsored Miss Miss
[01:44] Colombia you know for the for those
[01:47] parades and stuff like that so it was a
[01:48] very successful business right um and
[01:52] then what happened was you know they
[01:53] started having a lot of kids right and
[01:56] you know how that happens you know it
[01:58] just misman stuff like that but then
[02:01] when when the war the war started
[02:04] everywhere in the world right where
[02:07] Colombia wasn't really a strong leader
[02:11] in
[02:12] in Eon economically right so those
[02:16] companies that uh
[02:19] had let's say aass a a solid foundation
[02:24] or or pretty much wealth just uh got
[02:28] decimated because of the currency right
[02:30] and and a lot of people you know since
[02:33] they were so many kids and stuff like
[02:35] that
[02:36] they the C the currency just collapsed
[02:40] and and it's not like an an alarming
[02:41] alarming rate like how it was in Germany
[02:43] for example right but just
[02:47] the the chaos around the world showed
[02:51] why a weak currency you know it's
[02:54] not is not the way to go right so a
[02:58] company that would operate in
[03:01] different uh cities around the country
[03:04] participated in
[03:05] events uh had a solid foundation that
[03:08] nobody would have thought that it
[03:10] wouldn't have
[03:11] lasted uh it it it had to be sold you
[03:14] know almost for nothing and it's funny
[03:17] because the properties that were
[03:19] built um as a result of that because
[03:22] some money got put into some properties
[03:24] and they they created they built some
[03:26] buildings and stuff like that those
[03:28] buildings have kept their the value
[03:30] quite well compared to the to the
[03:32] company as and it's a reflection of a
[03:35] little harder asset but when you're
[03:38] operating based on on a currency and you
[03:40] have to pay wages and all of a sudden
[03:45] the the materials cost a lot more you
[03:48] know it's uh it's something that just
[03:52] destroys companies in the long term so
[03:54] it's how sailor says all the time you
[03:56] know there's there's no many companies
[03:57] that last 100 years right and my
[04:00] family's company is a is an example of
[04:02] that and the reason why I came to
[04:05] America um pretty much when I understood
[04:09] the currency the fiat currency that we
[04:11] had and at that time you know I wasn't
[04:14] really a bitcoiner I moved here in
[04:17] 2018 I had a few Bitcoin I had a few
[04:20] exposure uh of Bitcoin but I I realized
[04:24] that I was in a disadvantage if I wanted
[04:27] to earn in Colombian peso
[04:31] compared to dollars right I remember
[04:33] when I was a when I was a kid I would
[04:36] the PS4 or the PS3 the PS2 would cost
[04:39] certain amount of money and then like
[04:40] all of a sudden three four years later I
[04:42] was like oh wow it almost doubled in
[04:44] price but in dollars stay the same so
[04:47] the Colombian Peso is only 10 12 years
[04:50] lost half its purchasing power compared
[04:52] to the
[04:53] dollar right so that's what prompted me
[04:56] to move here mostly obviously there's
[05:00] uh more opportunities for growth I
[05:02] didn't live a bad life in Colombia I
[05:03] didn't have the the need for example but
[05:05] if I wanted to excel in life I knew I
[05:07] had to have the foundation of a stronger
[05:10] currency and at that time I didn't
[05:12] realize how important Bitcoin was but I
[05:15] saw what I saw to the dollar from the
[05:18] peso what the what like people see on
[05:20] Bitcoin now from the dollar so I think
[05:23] that's very important to to to like keep
[05:27] find like a better monetary
[05:30] instrument uh from what you
[05:32] have absolutely and it it shows so good
[05:36] I I love your example of like you saw
[05:39] your amount of the
[05:41] PS4 uh in dollars and then in Colombian
[05:44] currency and then it doubled in the
[05:45] Colombian currency it's still the same
[05:47] price in in dollars uh you with that
[05:50] example you got what inflation is even
[05:53] though you probably didn't fully cfts of
[05:55] like what's going on there I needed so
[05:58] long I needed to get to Bitcoin to
[06:00] actually understand the financial fear
[06:02] system which is a weird thing but that's
[06:04] why people move their financial energy
[06:07] to bitcoin because they inherently know
[06:10] if the price things in Bitcoin
[06:13] everything gets cheaper all the time and
[06:15] that's how it naturally should be it
[06:17] should not be naturally that much
[06:19] cheaper because Bitcoin has a ma major
[06:21] adoption rate but it's it's it's uh it's
[06:25] the the one reason why people people
[06:28] first should move as gr as possible to
[06:30] the money printer or completely out of
[06:33] the system so like if you want to be in
[06:35] the Fiat system be in the dollar system
[06:37] the US dollar system um but the best
[06:41] case is to be completely outside and be
[06:43] in the Bitcoin system and I think your
[06:45] your your story actually shows us really
[06:47] good with like you saw the inflation
[06:49] rate of your currency against the the
[06:51] mother of all Fe currencies the US
[06:54] dollar and then you're like ah I want to
[06:56] move as close to the money printer
[06:58] basically
[07:00] um as possible and now you kind of move
[07:02] to to the Bitcoin land because you're
[07:04] like all still it's still a rigged
[07:06] system so I have to move to to
[07:09] bitly took me a step yeah so and and if
[07:12] you if you if you if you see the chart
[07:16] of BTC to to cop which is cop Colombian
[07:20] Peso and BTC to doar because we always
[07:23] think of Bitcoin in
[07:27] a uh dollar price right every $100,000
[07:31] Bitcoin right but if you if you see just
[07:34] the last year let's say from last year
[07:36] to
[07:37] today the growth of Bitcoin on on the
[07:40] Colombian Peso has been
[07:42] 150% right and on the dollar is been
[07:46] 123% right so yeah if you go to one year
[07:49] back yeah
[07:50] 150 right but if you go back
[07:53] to BTC to
[07:56] USD the growth is less right and that's
[07:59] just not and then you can see the
[08:02] difference yeah 135 yeah so it's a %
[08:06] difference just so the bus is running F
[08:09] or the train is moving faster the
[08:11] Bitcoin train is moving faster for
[08:12] people that are not in the US dollar to
[08:17] acquire Bitcoin right so I I understand
[08:20] your podcast is seen worldwide and and
[08:22] he said to see some friends in Colombia
[08:24] that still don't understand Bitcoin I
[08:26] was just there last week and a lot of
[08:28] them
[08:30] I did all my efforts to explain you know
[08:31] the sound money
[08:33] the the importance
[08:36] of uh a sound monetary system where
[08:39] there's no uh true
[08:42] scarcity
[08:44] decimation it's even almost 200% in like
[08:48] it's even worse than that like it's
[08:51] exactly exactly so in these countries
[08:55] you know people should
[08:56] be um have the most urgency they should
[09:00] have the most urgency than in other uh
[09:03] currencies to acquire Bitcoin as fast as
[09:05] possible because it's pretty much a
[09:07] guaranteed
[09:08] return because uh it's just losing so
[09:11] much value against against Bitcoin and
[09:15] um and I don't think you see that a lot
[09:17] in in in the podcast and online like
[09:19] they obviously mentioned Argentine peso
[09:22] um and the Turkish lra and the the
[09:26] Nigerian Nara so people mention these
[09:29] currencies but they don't look at the
[09:31] actual difference and it's significant
[09:34] right you could have bought
[09:35] 15% more
[09:37] Bitcoin um even if you're a bitcoiner if
[09:40] you earning dollars right so it's it's
[09:44] super important to if you're one of
[09:46] those countries start
[09:48] allocating start allocating because um
[09:51] it's just it's just going to be 10 15
[09:53] years God knows how do you see Bitcoin
[09:56] currently do you see it as like a
[09:58] savings tool retirement fund as like an
[10:00] investment or like or is it already
[10:02] where you are like I'm denominating my
[10:05] wealth in Bitcoin and and you're like I
[10:07] want to be as much on bitcoin like 100%
[10:10] on bitcoin and I'm kind of I'm almost
[10:13] struggling now to pay fat bills because
[10:15] like I'm 100% in Bitcoin I'm trying to
[10:18] figure out the whole thing now with
[10:19] Capal gain stacks and stuff like that
[10:21] how how do you see it well uh it's it's
[10:25] a funny mix for me
[10:27] because uh I had I I became I would say
[10:30] a
[10:31] maximalist in uh not not that long ago I
[10:34] would say
[10:34] 2023
[10:36] right uh and I started buying
[10:39] aggressively more when the ETFs got got
[10:43] announced right because for me that was
[10:45] a Tipping Point of okay now it's now
[10:49] it's not just a hedge against inflation
[10:52] or it's not a savings tool I always saw
[10:54] the value of of Bitcoin and I understood
[10:56] the SC the scarcity the mostly on 2023
[10:59] but when the ETFs got approved that prom
[11:01] me to move it was like the wakeup call
[11:03] like you don't have enough
[11:07] and that was a Tipping Point and so for
[11:10] me Bitcoin I know there's some people
[11:12] that are the
[11:13] purists of
[11:15] Bitcoin and they hate the ETFs
[11:19] and they don't they don't think you know
[11:22] black rock and all these other
[11:23] institutions should be purchasing
[11:24] Bitcoin but uh I had some money locked
[11:27] in retirement accounts
[11:30] that uh allowed me to I couldn't take
[11:33] him out I couldn't buy Bitcoin with them
[11:34] even if I wanted to right without
[11:36] triggering a taxable event or
[11:38] penalties
[11:40] so I have self- custody as well because
[11:44] that's obviously the purest form of
[11:45] Bitcoin where you want to have it um no
[11:49] one can take it away from you but if you
[11:52] have money logged in these retirement
[11:54] accounts and you have no idea how bad
[11:56] that they were performing I had like
[11:59] bonds and low growth low growth
[12:04] um ETFs and all that stuff that is just
[12:08] eating your wealth up because it's still
[12:10] a Fiat standard um savings vehicle right
[12:13] so it wasn't even beating inflation in
[12:15] most cases my my best performing was S&P
[12:18] 500 so when the ETFs came out I
[12:20] literally just just uh transfer all that
[12:23] money to the into the to bitcoin bya the
[12:27] ETF and he been a good uh
[12:29] super good investment so it opened up
[12:33] new money to be invested in in in the
[12:35] ETFs and the way I see Bitcoin
[12:38] now and that's a great question I I see
[12:41] it as
[12:43] a as I will never touch my
[12:46] Bitcoin I'll just keep adding to it I
[12:49] dollar cost average as well and I see
[12:52] opportunities I send more I do have
[12:55] strike um also which is a great
[12:59] application and through that I've been
[13:03] thinking about um doing the the full
[13:05] Bitcoin
[13:07] standard uh feature that they have I
[13:09] don't know if you if you you know about
[13:11] it that's Jack M's app so they pretty
[13:14] much deposit all your all your money
[13:16] there and it gets transformed into
[13:19] transformed into Bitcoin right away and
[13:21] then when you pay your bills you pay you
[13:23] can pay with your credit card or or you
[13:25] can pay your car payment with with
[13:27] Bitcoin uh so
[13:29] SLS that's a good idea too and at the
[13:33] end of the year they just calculate the
[13:36] taxes for you and and you can do it
[13:38] yourself and if you pay taxes that means
[13:39] you pay you you make money so I've been
[13:43] thinking of switching to that standard
[13:44] right now I just aggressively save in
[13:47] Bitcoin and I stopped investing in any
[13:50] other savings vehicle S&P 500 all that
[13:52] stuff I have a few allocation on other
[13:54] stocks I have mic I own micro strategy I
[13:56] own Tesla I own so magnific
[14:00] seven uh stocks as well just because I
[14:03] had them prior and I just kept them
[14:06] there uh but right now everything new
[14:08] that I do is is is
[14:10] Bitcoin interesting yeah it's like the
[14:14] the strategy of moving actually
[14:16] everything to bitcoin is quite
[14:17] aggressive and and I get that I made
[14:20] actually uh today or yesterday no
[14:23] yesterday actually um so for the viewers
[14:26] that listen now it's probably like one
[14:28] or two weeks behind because I'm one or
[14:30] two weeks usually behind with with with
[14:33] uh publishing the episodes uh I made an
[14:36] uh Community question on my YouTube
[14:38] channel and asked like uh do you have
[14:41] any altcoins besides Bitcoin and 50%
[14:46] said yes so I was I was surprised
[14:48] because I have a Bitcoin only channel so
[14:51] I only talk about Bitcoin like yes the
[14:54] the name ethereum Solana drops here and
[14:57] there up but always in a negative frame
[14:59] so I never talk about those things uh so
[15:04] being not only Bitcoin only in the uh
[15:08] crypto space but also being Bitcoin only
[15:10] with like having no stocks no fear
[15:13] that's really aggressive and you are
[15:15] part of like a very select few people in
[15:18] the world that that's for sure you're
[15:20] like like a very very select few of like
[15:23] the 0.1% of all bitcoiners kind of I
[15:27] don't know what actually the numbers are
[15:29] but I think like that and the the
[15:31] strategy behind that is really easy you
[15:33] get the most out of your Bitcoin because
[15:35] you hold it the longest possible time of
[15:38] course you can also experience with like
[15:40] borrowing get Bitcoin and and all those
[15:43] things but if you don't want to
[15:45] participate in the credit system that's
[15:47] the best way for you to do it because
[15:50] you have the longest possible time in
[15:52] Bitcoin and you only pay capital gains
[15:55] tax on money you made so it's anyway a
[15:59] profit for you so like that it's it's a
[16:01] no-brainer for me to do the strategy and
[16:04] I'm thinking also to to moving that
[16:06] strategy even though I I I'm kind of
[16:10] having like an more of an easy talk
[16:12] because uh some of my Bitcoin actually
[16:14] taxfree uh so I don't have actually to
[16:17] pay taxes for for some amount of my
[16:19] Bitcoin but yeah it's definitely an
[16:22] interesting strategy to be like Bitcoin
[16:24] focused on bitcoin only in that regard
[16:26] are you having any plans to sell your
[16:29] your stocks or you want to keep them for
[16:31] longer no so I'm actually hoping the
[16:32] stocks I have get involved into the ones
[16:35] I kept is because they they could
[16:38] technically have some involvement with
[16:40] Bitcoin in the future so Tesla has
[16:42] Bitcoin micro strategy def we all know
[16:44] what micro strategy does right and uh
[16:47] and it's actually in the last year it's
[16:49] returned more than the Bitcoin I own so
[16:51] micro strategy it's always great at
[16:55] Nvidia they they can mine the they can
[16:57] mine Bitcoin if they want for free right
[16:59] if you actually look at Nvidia and I
[17:01] haven't heard this conversation a lot
[17:03] but I I was thinking about it Nvidia
[17:05] could create one of the biggest Bitcoin
[17:08] farms uh mining mining farms in the
[17:10] world they they make the they know how
[17:12] to make the chips they can make them the
[17:14] most efficient and who knows who knows
[17:16] in the future if they start mining their
[17:18] own Bitcoin or but they are in some way
[17:22] already involved with it because if you
[17:23] have those super processors and they're
[17:26] going to be used eventually to M to m
[17:29] coin and so I think Nvidia Nvidia and
[17:31] Bitcoin will collide at one point so I I
[17:34] I still have Nvidia but I can tell you
[17:36] it's a very slow low percentage of my
[17:39] allocation um as well but uh it's
[17:43] because they're going to be related to
[17:44] bitcoin and and I hope uh they do it
[17:47] because it's super smart and if you see
[17:50] the market caps uh Nvidia is is bigger
[17:53] than Bitcoin which is funny you know you
[17:55] would never think that a company is
[17:57] bigger than the the whole Bitcoin
[17:59] Network
[18:00] and that means we're still early that
[18:03] means we're still early to bitcoin as
[18:05] well um I also wanted to share with you
[18:09] another technique that I use with
[18:11] spending because I know a lot of
[18:13] people uh Mo mostly in these situations
[18:17] Miami New York Los Angeles
[18:20] London uh just High Cost of
[18:23] Living um places they struggle with
[18:27] spending a lot so what I like doing I
[18:31] call it the mirror technique so let's
[18:33] say if I buy a
[18:35] $20 let's say I bought a charger and say
[18:37] I bought this charger for my phone
[18:39] $20 right automatically I send $20 to
[18:43] bitcoin as well right so everything I
[18:45] spend is like it cost me twice so the
[18:49] way I see it is if I'm buying
[18:52] something I'm keeping myself from buying
[18:54] Bitcoin with that money so it's going to
[18:57] cost me a lot more so I I put in my head
[19:00] that everything I buy cost twice so I
[19:02] send half the money to bitcoin so if I'm
[19:04] going to buy a
[19:06] $200 or let's say I go I go eat and uh
[19:09] outside and and I get a $200 bill for
[19:11] for
[19:12] food I pay the 200 bucks on food but I
[19:15] sent 200 bucks to bitcoin and I don't
[19:18] feel bad like that and it helps me safe
[19:20] so it keeps your spending
[19:23] regulated and it keeps you also in some
[19:28] way a maximalist is of Bitcoin because
[19:29] you you're you're thinking okay if I
[19:32] spend here I got a sent to bitcoin too
[19:34] and you got to be I I don't know how
[19:36] many people that I I came up with that
[19:39] for myself I don't know if anybody else
[19:40] does it in the world I'm sure they do
[19:42] sure there's someone out there but it's
[19:44] been really good for me and it helps you
[19:47] like I said keep your your spending
[19:50] habits where they need to be you don't
[19:52] go crazy you still increase your Bitcoin
[19:55] allocation and um works out it works out
[20:00] it's a good habit I I love that idea
[20:02] like uh I I
[20:04] see in in the Fiat world uh people tell
[20:08] me like oh I have some some some
[20:10] interesting thing where like I save $1
[20:13] for each transaction I do like I just
[20:15] like in a savings account I'm like ah
[20:17] like yeah do do the same thing but with
[20:19] Bitcoin that is a really good idea and
[20:22] what what you're basically doing is
[20:23] you're doubling the incentive for being
[20:27] more minimalistic and for being
[20:31] more more minded more carefully minded
[20:34] for like how where you safe where you
[20:37] spend your money because every Bitcoin
[20:39] already knows when you spend it you're
[20:42] like oh I could have bought Bitcoin with
[20:44] that money but if you then kind of
[20:47] punishing yourself with like I SP spend
[20:50] $20 here I also put additionally $20
[20:53] away to directly to bitcoin uh that
[20:56] that's really I unfortunately can't do
[20:58] that because money is already in Bitcoin
[21:01] right it would be an interesting
[21:03] strategy every time I buy something I
[21:05] have to get 20% I have if I buy 20 euros
[21:09] of something I have to get 20 EUR in
[21:12] depth to get more Bitcoin and I credit
[21:14] system or something like that that would
[21:15] be fun uh to do that but yeah it's also
[21:18] interesting I I just want to show
[21:20] because people don't don't believe me
[21:22] that and and maybe they they can see it
[21:25] now on the screen for for those who also
[21:27] watch the podcast uh for those who don't
[21:29] I explain it uh we basically have now a
[21:32] table where there's a rank one uh to
[21:35] let's say 10 assets of the world the
[21:37] biggest ones and gold is obviously
[21:39] number one by far by the way it's like
[21:43] five times bigger than than than Apple
[21:46] the number one the number number two and
[21:49] there is like one two three four five
[21:53] individual companies it's so crazy to
[21:56] say that out loud five individual
[21:58] companies that are bigger than Bitcoin
[22:00] it's Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon and
[22:03] alphabet so Google basically uh that are
[22:07] individually bigger than Bitcoin that
[22:09] that's just it just blows my mind so you
[22:12] want me to say something yeah absolutely
[22:14] so yeah if guys are looking at this
[22:16] chart and it's it's a result of of Fiat
[22:19] right the money has to flow somewhere to
[22:23] keep the wealth right and for the past
[22:27] 20 25 years years the the best place to
[22:30] to store that has been in technology
[22:33] stocks right so when
[22:36] you when you have a savings vehicle like
[22:39] Bitcoin or a monetary Network like
[22:41] Bitcoin you don't need this assets so
[22:45] it's slowly climbing up the ladder right
[22:47] last year we were smaller than silver at
[22:50] one point and and I think that was a
[22:51] huge milestone and people didn't didn't
[22:54] really talk about it uh when Bitcoin
[22:56] flipped silver and because silver was
[22:59] still consider you know um precious
[23:01] medal still consider a precious metal
[23:03] but it's going nowhere so when you have
[23:05] these companies and they see Bitcoin
[23:08] just climbing climbing climbing and
[23:11] they're going to have to adopt it
[23:12] they're going to have to adopt it at one
[23:14] point maybe it's 2% allocation maybe
[23:16] it's 3% maybe it's just their cash these
[23:18] companies are sitting in so much so much
[23:20] cash uh it's not even funny and and they
[23:23] send dividends Out and because they
[23:25] don't know what to do with the cash
[23:27] because they know they know it sucks
[23:28] they know it's it's melting it's a
[23:30] melting piece of ice and one analogy
[23:33] that I I like to mention with Bitcoin
[23:34] when I'm explaining my friends or just
[23:36] any casual conversation is is Bitcoin is
[23:40] like an arc you know if you want to
[23:43] compare it to you know religious um
[23:47] events right so imagine Bitcoin is an
[23:50] arc of 21 million
[23:53] seats right and right now
[23:56] we're we're in a slow small sea level
[23:59] right and then the rain all the rain is
[24:03] Fiat money all around the world Fiat
[24:06] money just flooding right and you better
[24:09] get you better book a place in in the
[24:11] Bitcoin Arc because the the ocean is
[24:13] going to keep floting up the Fiat ocean
[24:15] and then Bitcoin is going to stay on top
[24:17] and it's only 21 million seats so you
[24:20] better book your place and a lot of
[24:22] those seats are already taken so reality
[24:24] there's I don't even know how many Maybe
[24:28] three four million people can be whole
[24:32] coiners maybe maybe less and also when
[24:36] have you seen an opportunity
[24:38] to to be part of an elite
[24:42] right there's less there's going to be
[24:44] less whole coiners in the world than
[24:47] there
[24:48] are uh multi-millionaires right at one
[24:51] point the biggest the the biggest Elite
[24:54] right now is is or not the biggest I
[24:56] would say the the top of the top of of
[24:59] Elites are the billionaires right I
[25:02] think it's only like about 2 200
[25:04] worldwide something like that right but
[25:07] millionaire there's so many Bill
[25:09] millionaires with an M there's so many
[25:11] in the
[25:12] world there's more than
[25:14] Bitcoin there's less Bitcoin for every
[25:17] millionaire in the world so imagine
[25:19] people like if you want to be part of an
[25:22] elite get to one Bitcoin because in in a
[25:25] decade from now 10 15 years it's going
[25:28] to be 3 million people out of 8 billion
[25:30] people that own a coin so how is it not
[25:33] a good idea to belong to such a small
[25:37] percentage of the world's population
[25:39] right there's 58 million millionaires
[25:42] right not even these millionaires could
[25:45] acquire one Bitcoin for each of them and
[25:48] we already know the Lost coins Satoshi
[25:51] coins that are lost we already know
[25:53] sailor not
[25:55] selling sailor not selling he's got 2%
[25:57] of the supply we know the US government
[26:00] has some Bitcoin there right we got Mr
[26:03] 100 who knows who that is some people
[26:06] say it's uh the Saudi Prince we have no
[26:09] idea who that guy is you know Mr 100 so
[26:11] the the whales and the lost coins it
[26:16] gives us very little opportunity and and
[26:18] I don't think people understand how
[26:19] small
[26:21] of how small of U of coins are actually
[26:24] left for the whole
[26:25] world and we have to we have to book the
[26:27] place The
[26:29] Arc if because that's our only way of
[26:31] getting ahead in this system especially
[26:33] for Our Generation younger guys like us
[26:36] that we didn't have the opportunity to
[26:37] buy housing for a few
[26:40] dollars like where I live right now you
[26:42] know the cheapest apartment one bedroom
[26:44] apartment is $400,000 of downtown for
[26:47] lot of them so it's four coins for like
[26:49] a one bedroom apartment right and you
[26:53] have HOA and you have assessments and
[26:56] then the the elevator is going to get
[26:57] damaged so real estate is a great
[26:59] savings vehicle too I would say yeah
[27:01] just buy your house stuff like that
[27:05] and do sorry I just interrupt do do you
[27:08] know that Meme of like uh Boomers the
[27:15] house like and and I I really want to
[27:18] make that comparison now may maybe I can
[27:20] show it and I want to make a point here
[27:22] because I think you you raised a really
[27:24] good one here uh this is this is the
[27:27] meme Boomer selling the homes for 2
[27:28] million after buying them in 1969 for
[27:32] seven
[27:34] Ries it's
[27:44] true I love that it's so that video Yeah
[27:49] and and the point that I wanted to make
[27:52] uh here is the same thing will happen to
[27:56] all those OG bitcoiners that have now a
[27:58] whole coin because if we go back to say
[28:02] how many millionaires are there sorry to
[28:04] interrupt so long uh uh how many
[28:08] millionaires are there I have too many
[28:09] tabs going on I hope I share a right one
[28:11] yeah uh 58 million millionaires are
[28:14] there one millionaire can only have like
[28:18] half a Bitcoin or like even less than
[28:21] half a Bitcoin like 0.4 Bitcoin or
[28:23] something like that and to put that in
[28:26] this uh in perspective that's 1.5% of
[28:29] the global adult population so if you
[28:33] have half a Bitcoin if you have like 0.4
[28:36] Bitcoin you already are in the top 1%
[28:40] 1.5% of the whole world and probably
[28:44] you're probably uh already in the top 1%
[28:47] so the question is where are you if you
[28:50] have one whole Bitcoin uh and then the
[28:54] other question is also like what's the
[28:55] timeline for this because obviously if
[28:58] if you have now one Bitcoin you're not
[29:00] in the top 1% but in the future you
[29:03] probably are it depends on how long you
[29:05] have to wait for that right how do how
[29:07] do you look at that yeah so what the way
[29:10] I look at it is right now is in the what
[29:14] top percental of the world I am when it
[29:18] comes to Holdings not
[29:19] necessarily in Bitcoin sorry in in uh
[29:24] dollar or Fiat terms right because
[29:26] obviously $100,000 is not going to put
[29:28] you in the in the top 1% right but out
[29:33] of 8 billion people or seven or eight
[29:35] billion people that are going to need or
[29:36] be exposed to bitcoin at one point plus
[29:39] companies plus governments right because
[29:41] this this is just not you and and other
[29:44] humans right it's going to be companies
[29:46] it's going to be exchanges it's going to
[29:49] be ETFs it's going to be countries is
[29:52] going to
[29:53] be whole different things in the future
[29:56] that we don't know about that will run
[29:58] run with Bitcoin so having a coin people
[30:03] need to understand the importance of
[30:04] being a coin and I rather be on the boat
[30:06] than off the boat even if you're not a
[30:08] bitcoiner even if you don't believe in
[30:09] it you think it's a scam mathematically
[30:13] why wouldn't you want to belong
[30:15] to such a small group of people that
[30:18] have that opportunity right it's an
[30:20] opportunity of a lifetime and I didn't
[30:22] buy Bitcoin at 100 bucks and 200 bucks
[30:24] no I bought Bitcoin when it was tens of
[30:26] thousands of dollars right and I keep
[30:28] buying every single day and I don't look
[30:29] at the price and I buy every time that
[30:32] I've I said I have I DCA I do the mirror
[30:36] technique and when I see an opportunity
[30:39] if I have some extra cash send it on to
[30:41] bitcoin right
[30:43] so the the percentage of holders
[30:47] compared to the even compared to
[30:48] bitcoiners I think how many bitcoiners
[30:50] are there 300 million people right now
[30:53] or is it up maybe 400 million of people
[30:56] that own uh Bitcoin
[30:58] even in that person out of those 300 or
[31:00] 400 million people you're you're not
[31:03] they're you're you're far ahead if you
[31:05] if you have a coin most of them own
[31:08] little bits of coin right so get to 0.21
[31:11] you know get to a a direct divisible of
[31:13] of Bitcoin 0.21 and just climb your way
[31:17] up
[31:18] because the more you have is is going to
[31:20] be significant in the future right do
[31:23] you know how many how many dollars are
[31:25] printed every day uh no and nobody knows
[31:29] right well it it says that it's
[31:31] estimated about 568 million a day I
[31:35] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[31:39] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:42] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[31:44] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[31:47] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[31:50] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:53] go out there and show that you are a
[31:56] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:58] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:02] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:04] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:07] collections you have the date of the
[32:09] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there

[32:29] watches so so much if you watch or
[32:33] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[32:35] I'll guess you already bought some
[32:37] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:40] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:43] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:45] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[32:47] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[32:50] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:52] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:55] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:58] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:00] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[33:04] your bitbox and the next step is to
[33:07] really level up your sovereignty as an
[33:09] individual you have to have the most
[33:12] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:14] secure your own devices you have to
[33:17] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:20] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:22] where you live you even want to have a
[33:25] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:27] move in case something goes really
[33:29] really wrong and through all those steps
[33:31] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[33:34] step by step and if you visit the
[33:36] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[33:40] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[33:43] out how you can level up your
[33:45] sovereignty wow yeah like it's it's it's
[33:48] crazy how much the the the how big that
[33:51] number actually is it's it's crazy
[33:54] exactly so if we convert that to bitcoin
[33:56] how much is it
[33:58] 568 million in Bitcoin how many coins
[34:01] are there oh that's
[34:03] a that's a big amount of of coins yeah
[34:08] I'm GNA do it real quick I mean it
[34:09] should be um uhit wait uh so it's 56
[34:14] million 568 million yeah exactly it
[34:18] should be 56 yeah that's uh oh
[34:21] 560 uh million that are dollars oh like
[34:26] every day that that never heard the
[34:29] number that's crazy and if if we put
[34:33] yeah you want you want to double check
[34:34] it in Google that's what I that's what I
[34:37] think it is that's and that um if we
[34:41] divide that with like the 100,000 that
[34:44] that's like what
[34:47] 5,600 Bitcoin uh sounds about right I
[34:51] got the seros correct yeah it's just
[34:53] hard to calculate how many seros yeah
[34:55] it's I'm sure sailor sailor would do it
[34:57] like this
[34:59] he he always does those calculations I
[35:01] also research by the way in the meantime
[35:04] uh the top 1% currently holds uh on
[35:08] average the top 1% of households uh
[35:11] currently holds around 14 million uh
[35:14] dollars which by the way is also I
[35:16] researched that once in in in Austria
[35:19] it's also the same in Austria so
[35:20] worldwide also seems it seems to be a
[35:22] good number around 10 to 15 million that
[35:25] the top 1% has on average Network
[35:28] and then we go back of like that top
[35:32] 1% um of of of the world will not be
[35:36] able to have a full Bitcoin they have
[35:40] now
[35:42] 13.4 million in average net worth but
[35:46] those families will not be able in the
[35:48] future to have every every one of those
[35:51] a full Bitcoin so those 30 million will
[35:55] be like 0.5 Bitcoin or something like
[35:58] that uh it's like depends on where you
[36:00] put the number so that that that in
[36:03] itself is like a 26 million uh price
[36:06] target for Bitcoin if you just make that
[36:08] easy calculation obviously you cannot
[36:10] make that trans uh that calculation that
[36:12] easy uh but uh that that's uh seems to
[36:16] be uh directionally correct yeah so and
[36:19] that's and that's assuming that everyone
[36:21] can have a fair share right yeah which
[36:24] is impossible right so if you account
[36:27] for all those flost coins for the whales
[36:30] there's there's like three million four
[36:32] million people that can
[36:34] realistically be whole coiners right um
[36:38] because some people just just math just
[36:41] can't do it if these guys have Mr 100
[36:43] how many does Mr 100 have buying a 100
[36:46] every
[36:47] day I'm curious I'm curious how much
[36:50] does he have right or those do they have
[36:54] who knows if it's a group if it's a
[36:55] company if it's and that's the crazy
[36:56] thing about Bitcoin you just don't know
[36:59] who who's buying you know and but it's
[37:03] there in your eyes you can see all the
[37:06] activity on the chain and and you can
[37:08] see
[37:09] who is buying and who's selling and if
[37:13] the US everybody remember a couple weeks
[37:15] ago everybody had their eyes on that
[37:17] um USA uh holding because Biden wanted
[37:22] to sell the Bitcoin and everybody was
[37:23] watching the wallet and we had a little
[37:26] panic
[37:28] and so we just don't know how many
[37:30] people are buying and how like I said 5
[37:33] and I just checked it's 541 million uh
[37:37] dollars um that are printed every day 30
[37:41] million bills that equat to $541 million
[37:45] so why would you want to have more of
[37:47] that that day what can we do what can
[37:50] you and me do with a day of Supply right
[37:54] we we just never have to work again in
[37:55] our lives buy some bit
[37:58] yeah we buy bitco yeah and uh it's a
[38:02] billion a billion bucks a day uh sorry
[38:04] every two days they create a billion
[38:06] dollars and they throw them in the
[38:08] economy so the monetary debasement is a
[38:10] lot but what I what I just said is
[38:12] interesting because like we our my
[38:15] natural thing is like oh let's buy
[38:17] Bitcoin with that how long do central
[38:19] banks just like figure it out I'm like
[38:21] oh we are screwed anyways let's buy in
[38:24] secret as EDM as many Bitcoin as we can
[38:27] by the way I just looked it up Mr Mr 100
[38:31] apparently according to BTC info charts
[38:35] has around uh what is it 56 56,000
[38:40] Bitcoin in his wallet so around 5.7
[38:44] billion uh worth of of of value in US
[38:49] dollar that could be the banks you know
[38:51] like you that could be the banks buying
[38:53] in secret that could be Saudi Arabia
[38:55] aranco buying in secret
[38:58] because if you and if you look at those
[38:59] economies if you go to and see what
[39:01] they're doing Saudi Arabia uh the Arab
[39:06] Emirates they are they're transitioning
[39:09] away from from oil as their primary
[39:11] source and that's why they invest so
[39:12] much in entertainment if you see Formula
[39:14] 1 races they're on it if they the golf
[39:17] tournament the LIF golf um they did
[39:21] also uh Ronaldo they sign Ronaldo
[39:23] Cristiano Ronaldo for their league so
[39:26] they understand that their wealth and
[39:28] their their capabilities to be that
[39:32] world global wealth leader in when it
[39:34] comes to oil is is not forever so
[39:37] they're transitioning to doing all this
[39:38] stuff and those guys are smart I'm sure
[39:41] they're buying Bitcoin like crazy too
[39:43] mean they had the conference over there
[39:44] too where Eric Trump touched the topic
[39:47] and if you want to go in a little bit uh
[39:50] into the US specifically with Trump we
[39:53] now have a president that
[39:58] I don't know if he fully understands
[40:01] Bitcoin itself but at least he's
[40:05] not uh a threat to bitcoin and his son
[40:09] Eric is the one who really understands
[40:10] and they say that Baron the younger kid
[40:14] he also is a bitcoiner that's what they
[40:16] say right so if we get that strategic
[40:19] Reserve it's over it's over Bitcoin is
[40:23] going to go up but I know there's
[40:25] they're trying to push other cryptos and
[40:28] and stuff like that so we got to see
[40:30] what
[40:30] happens to me as yeah to me Bitcoin is
[40:34] going to is going to
[40:35] reach uh regardless it's going to reach
[40:38] the heights
[40:39] regardless um but if the US acquires a
[40:42] million dollars or sorry a million coins
[40:44] it's it's a lot it's a lot of the supply
[40:47] if you if you see also states are now
[40:50] introducing LW there was a map I don't
[40:52] know have you seen that map where they
[40:54] have like every state with like the
[40:56] Bitcoin sign that has introduced
[40:58] legislation for their their own Reserve
[41:00] like the US
[41:01] states um so Texas is one of them uh you
[41:05] know Oklahoma I think is another one
[41:07] where they are introducing laws and they
[41:09] might pass to do reserves and people can
[41:12] donate Bitcoin to the to the reserve and
[41:15] then eventually they're going to be able
[41:16] to buy and then people can pay their
[41:19] taxes in Bitcoin and they're introducing
[41:22] very creative
[41:23] legislation uh in the United States and
[41:26] it's it's weird to not know to not see
[41:28] like other parts of the world just
[41:30] waking up when their currencies
[41:32] are weaker right so the US
[41:36] understands Cynthia alomes understands
[41:39] she's really smart and she's close to
[41:41] the president Michael sailor is a friend
[41:44] Eric Trump said it he's been friends
[41:45] with Michael sailor for for over 10
[41:48] years now I'm sure you went to the party
[41:50] you know that with Michael sailor I'm
[41:52] sure he's the man of the hour everybody
[41:55] talks to sailor he wasn't Mar Lago a few
[41:57] weeks ago so it's very unlikely I think
[42:01] now is it's more
[42:03] unlikely that nothing happens I think
[42:06] it's I think there's going to be some
[42:08] sort of Bitcoin purchasing but even if
[42:11] there isn't you know there's going to be
[42:12] States there's going to be more
[42:13] companies is going to be every day
[42:15] Michael saor just bought a billion
[42:16] dollars of Bitcoin on Monday right
[42:19] so the the the train is train is leaving
[42:24] and you got to jump you know and if
[42:25] you're in a different jurisdiction with
[42:27] a with more inflation the Train's moving
[42:29] like
[42:30] this and uh it's getting too it's too
[42:33] easy to buy Bitcoin now nowadays there's
[42:36] no excuse to not to not just
[42:39] allocate anything to bitcoin or at least
[42:42] get informed would you think the world
[42:44] is getting more digital or less digital
[42:48] right just ask anybody that question if
[42:50] someone tells you it's it's getting less
[42:52] digital or
[42:54] less uh software based or less
[42:58] technological people are lying right
[43:01] everybody knows it the world's getting
[43:02] more digital there's always new things
[43:03] there's drones there's AI there's
[43:07] technology that we've never seen before
[43:11] right so what makes you think
[43:13] that something that's literally the
[43:15] purest form of
[43:16] digital capital and digital monetary
[43:20] energy is not going to cut catch on in
[43:22] the future it's funny how they're like
[43:24] oh all this is moving towards this place
[43:26] but money not money is going backwards
[43:28] right so it just makes no sense with the
[43:31] direction of of the human race even if
[43:34] you see how technology is always what we
[43:38] strive to to advance so I think that's
[43:40] also a good point when it comes to
[43:42] bitcoin and and the future of
[43:44] Bitcoin it's also crazy what you just
[43:47] said how fast the increase of the rate
[43:51] of the adoption currently is when you
[43:54] look at one year ago
[43:57] um if you said the United States will
[44:01] buy Bitcoin in one year you were
[44:05] absolutely crazy you were laugh out the
[44:07] room it was like something that's like
[44:09] yeah yeah maybe someday like oh you're a
[44:11] crazy person yeah now it's already
[44:16] reality where the uh president is
[44:19] talking about it senators are talking
[44:21] about it states are talking about it and
[44:24] it's like yeah like it's just a question
[44:25] of time now it's crazy to think that
[44:29] nothing will happen that they don't do
[44:30] anything with Bitcoin that that's not a
[44:32] crazy thought and that's just one year
[44:34] like where are we in one year where are
[44:36] we 2026 like it it's just the the rate
[44:39] of how how fast the increase of that is
[44:42] it's it's it's mindboggling for me how
[44:45] how fast that how fast that is is really
[44:48] moving if you're in there like I think a
[44:50] lot of bitcoiners are in the the Twitter
[44:52] feeds in the podcast and listening and
[44:54] they're like so good informed that they
[44:57] kind of forget where we were a year or
[45:00] two years or five years ago and how fast
[45:04] how freaking fast we got like we are in
[45:07] the in the esur adoption kicking off we
[45:10] in the exponential people people only
[45:12] see like yesterday the people scream if
[45:16] the price goes down to
[45:18] 90,000 say say that to yourself like two
[45:21] years ago and say like the the Bitcoin
[45:23] price will crash down to
[45:25] 93,000 the you're like I I'll take that
[45:28] yeah take two two years ago what was the
[45:31] price like 16,000 or like a very low
[45:35] number at some point in 2022 so that
[45:38] that that's that's just great sorry for
[45:40] my small rent but it's it just shows the
[45:42] massive rate of adoption of Bitcoin
[45:45] absolutely it's it's crazy and and yeah
[45:48] people just don't talk about this like
[45:51] little things that are are just math you
[45:53] know just the daily Supply daily supply
[45:56] of Bitcoin how many times is it bought
[45:59] every day I know we still have reserves
[46:01] right but 450 Bitcoin every day right
[46:06] how many of that is getting bought just
[46:08] by only the ETFs and sailor right
[46:11] they're buying weeks and months of
[46:12] supplying every day every day right
[46:16] compared all the all these whales right
[46:17] they're buying just weeks and weeks of
[46:19] new Supply so what happens when those
[46:21] reserves those reserves are also going
[46:23] to drain right and it's at one point
[46:25] it's only going to be the new issuance
[46:27] that is going to be able to be bought 28
[46:29] we're going to get only 225 Bitcoin a
[46:32] day right so the having is super
[46:35] significant right so I I don't know if
[46:39] there's going to be Cycles anymore
[46:40] because people are like oh when the bare
[46:41] Market hits I don't I don't know with
[46:43] these rates of accelerated buying and
[46:46] all these people joining I think the
[46:48] daily issuance of Bitcoin is already
[46:50] super low where are we right now in in
[46:52] in Bitcoin issued right it's going to be
[46:57] pretty much done pretty much all the
[46:59] Bitcoins
[47:00] are are already Min
[47:04] so the the new inflation rate of Bitcoin
[47:07] 450 a day is nothing compared to what
[47:10] they're printing how do we say like 560
[47:13] million 540 million a day how many they
[47:16] can buy that daily Supply ridiculously
[47:19] ridiculously they can just buy like 20
[47:20] times 30 times 40 times whatever they
[47:22] want they can buy right so why would you
[47:26] buy or or work with something that is
[47:29] the base at that at that stratospheric
[47:33] level right is is Bitcoin is only 450
[47:37] that's it 450 is not a
[47:40] lot your people in your community can
[47:42] each buy a coin and and it's
[47:44] gone right so I just people just need to
[47:48] understand the
[47:50] math and it it will be it will be
[47:54] interesting because I think it's not
[47:57] like that we will hit like a point where
[47:59] we hit kind of Supply shock kind of an
[48:01] es adoption event however it looks um
[48:05] and from that point moving forward we
[48:09] will just astronomically move up with
[48:11] the price because there will no no there
[48:14] won't be enough Sellers and it it will
[48:16] be like an extended period of time I'm
[48:17] not talking about like an Omega candle
[48:20] on one day it will be more of like a few
[48:22] weeks maybe a few months we I'm like all
[48:24] right we we shut up like in the past we
[48:27] we we did it in
[48:28] 2013
[48:30] 2017 uh in in that time frames where we
[48:32] just like shut up from $1 to $1,000 what
[48:36] was it in a year or like it one and a
[48:39] half years like that that's that's crazy
[48:43] and that that can happen again like it's
[48:45] it's not out of the ordinary because uh
[48:48] there's so much interest now coming in
[48:50] and I I don't believe in diminishing
[48:53] returns at all even for a second yeah
[48:56] the the market cap compared to Global
[48:57] wealth is still still small like we
[49:00] showed earlier in the chart there's
[49:01] still a lot to grow still a lot to grow
[49:04] and and yeah you said it you said it
[49:06] exactly right and for the audience to
[49:08] understand you know all these people
[49:10] there's a stash of Bitcoin right here
[49:13] there's a daily Supply but there's
[49:14] already a stash that these people buy
[49:16] from right so it doesn't affect the
[49:19] price that much because this coins
[49:21] already priced right people are just
[49:23] Michael sailor here here here they're
[49:26] not grabbing from the that new Supply
[49:27] but this is getting this is getting
[49:28] smaller right the reserves of Bitcoin
[49:31] are smaller so
[49:34] when I'm curious to see to me that's
[49:36] that's a pivotal moment when the
[49:39] reserve uh just is is just bought out
[49:43] now now what now who's going to sell the
[49:46] Bitcoin now who's going to there's going
[49:48] to be a time where that's going to
[49:49] happen it's just it's just a matter of
[49:51] how fast like you said it could be over
[49:52] a week and shoot up but when people just
[49:56] start that's going to be that's going to
[49:57] come on the news you're going to see
[49:58] you're going to start seeing people like
[50:00] oh there's only the reserves of on on
[50:02] exchanges are this much right we only
[50:04] have like three months left of if we
[50:06] keep buying like that right so when that
[50:09] stash is is gone we're going to see the
[50:12] real free market and the
[50:15] real um fight for scarcity for True
[50:20] scarcity right so we're going I want to
[50:24] I want to be there to see it for sure
[50:26] want to be there to see it we should
[50:28] always uh we we we should get ready for
[50:30] that like we we will have we have I
[50:33] probably amp up my podcast from one day
[50:36] one per day to two per days or something
[50:37] like crazy like that like just like a a
[50:41] 12 hour stream of podcast or something
[50:43] like that may maybe we'll do that um one
[50:47] thing I want to get into with you before
[50:49] we we come to the end because we already
[50:51] like at 50 minutes it's it's fascinating
[50:53] how quick we went here right um You you
[50:57] are working in sales and you want to
[50:59] kind of touch on the importance of sales
[51:01] and and and what what what are you doing
[51:03] there uh I was in the past also a sales
[51:07] employee I'm I was not a big fan of it
[51:10] uh but I I like the art of sales and the
[51:14] Art of sales for me is basically uh the
[51:16] art of solving other people's problem
[51:19] which is an amazing thing to do in the
[51:22] world uh so like uh what is your take on
[51:25] on on sales and what what kind of your
[51:27] what you're doing right yeah so I am a
[51:30] sales manager for Honda okay in Fort
[51:34] Lauderdale okay and I think sales is a
[51:37] wonderful thing because it it opens
[51:39] doors
[51:40] and it helps you it creates good habits
[51:43] on you and it creates a behavior that is
[51:47] focused on on improving your life right
[51:52] if we detach a little bit from like oh I
[51:53] want to sell you a
[51:55] product a sales Behavior cuz I I didn't
[51:58] go to university I didn't want to go
[52:00] right all all my family all my cousins
[52:03] everybody went to University I didn't
[52:04] want to go I was like I don't like this
[52:07] right why would I be told what to do for
[52:08] four years so I was always a little bit
[52:11] aligned to the Bitcoin or maybe
[52:13] mentality but it wasn't because I was
[52:15] lazy and stuff like no I want to go I
[52:17] want to move to a jurisdiction where the
[52:19] money is strong and I can make my own
[52:22] story right and that's why I came to
[52:25] America
[52:26] and I and I joined I joined the sales I
[52:28] started as
[52:30] a uh doing sales call over the phone to
[52:33] make appointments for customers to come
[52:35] buy cars at Volkswagen right so that
[52:40] created a sales Behavior where I wanted
[52:42] more wanted more wanted more and it was
[52:44] rewarded at so I was like okay my time
[52:47] there was my colleague next to me and I
[52:48] was like okay my time is three times
[52:50] more than his time and we're the same
[52:53] job right and he has the same
[52:56] opportunities he has the same leads and
[52:58] I I'm worth three times more just
[53:00] because of what I do with my time
[53:03] so time is super important to me so when
[53:06] it comes to
[53:08] sales you can maximize your time and
[53:11] when it comes to money and and the
[53:13] results you get right because growing
[53:16] even if you graduate every after four
[53:17] years five years and you get a you get a
[53:19] job and you're going to you're going to
[53:22] you're going to need a promotion to earn
[53:23] more money right you're going to need
[53:25] two or three years of a promo to make
[53:26] more money in
[53:28] sales you see a guy we we have a
[53:30] Salesman that makes 250,000 a year we
[53:32] have another one that makes 60,000 a
[53:34] year and they're there the same hours
[53:37] now thankfully I manage the team and I
[53:39] get paid I get paid because of all of
[53:41] their performance right but
[53:44] um yeah like the behavior that gives you
[53:47] and the desire to be more to go to go
[53:49] for more and to push and to to get up in
[53:52] the morning and knowing that you need to
[53:55] sell something or to sell the car to
[53:58] make it happen it's it's really it's
[54:00] really cool I like that and and
[54:01] obviously you know providing a service
[54:03] you're talking to people there's two
[54:04] there's not two days that are the same
[54:07] in a sales environment so that's also
[54:09] cool when you have people that hate
[54:10] their jobs they're always miserable is
[54:13] because they're also they're also just
[54:15] repetitive they do the same thing every
[54:17] day same thing every day same thing
[54:18] every day so there's no two days for us
[54:21] let me tell you that so and I just do
[54:24] that I just have that instrument to now
[54:27] throw it in my Bitcoin stash that is
[54:29] going to allow me to retire early I know
[54:33] for a fact it's going to allow me to
[54:34] retire early I even open a restaurant
[54:36] back home in Colombia thanks to thanks
[54:40] to bitcoin right
[54:42] so it's it's our way it's and even for
[54:46] older people but I speak for you for you
[54:48] and me and our age group it's our way to
[54:51] be those guys in the video dancing with
[54:54] the with the house but for raspberries
[54:57] right it's our only chance our only
[54:59] opportunity
[55:01] to be you know maybe yeah maybe some
[55:04] people make more money than others but
[55:06] we we don't have yat sitting right there
[55:07] right outside right we don't have we
[55:11] don't have a Picasso in our house
[55:12] holding all our wealth
[55:15] right we're we're living in in in places
[55:19] that you need to spend five $6,000 just
[55:22] to just to breathe every month and
[55:24] that's because of inflation I saw the
[55:26] whole shift of inflation when when we
[55:28] passed from Trump when I when I first
[55:30] moved here to America it was 2018 and we
[55:32] had a gas gas was $2 one $1.98 for gas
[55:38] at one point in 2022 that or
[55:41] 2023 gas a gallon of gas was $5 here in
[55:44] America something that you would never
[55:45] think of right so bad
[55:48] monetary um
[55:51] policy inflationary policy where they
[55:53] just Sprint to do the all these things
[55:56] you know it's going to affect your life
[55:57] directly and I wanted to touch that
[55:59] point too the CPI inflation and the PPI
[56:02] inflation they're scams because they
[56:03] choose what to show you and they they're
[56:05] like oh yeah look this is this is the
[56:07] inflation rate okay we're at 3% we're
[56:09] good no you're not good how much does
[56:10] your insurance go up here in Fort
[56:12] Lauderdale it's a hurricane area right
[56:16] how much is how much are the house
[56:18] insurance go up in the past couple years
[56:20] how much are the car insurance I'm
[56:22] paying double for my car insurance now
[56:24] than three years ago that's not in
[56:27] so so yeah going back to sales it's a
[56:30] behavior that I think helps me a lot and
[56:32] and if people don't have a career or
[56:34] they're thinking of doing a career move
[56:35] and you have the personality you should
[56:37] definitely join sales because it's going
[56:38] to take you ahead it's going to take you
[56:40] ahead and and buy more Bitcoin with it
[56:44] that's that's why that's amazing I love
[56:47] that a lot really cool um I have one
[56:50] question to asked each and every one of
[56:51] my guests and it it kind of fits nicely
[56:53] with sales but maybe you have something
[56:55] else okay uh what what can we learn from
[56:57] you besides Bitcoin uh I would
[57:01] say that's a great question um just be
[57:05] forward looking I'm always forward
[57:07] looking but but living the present right
[57:10] I'm enjoying right now I'm grateful be
[57:13] grateful uh understand what's going on
[57:16] but be forward looking right because if
[57:19] you're also stuck just in the wave of
[57:22] reality every day you know you just
[57:24] don't know where to go you got to have
[57:25] Direction
[57:26] so I think one of my strongest
[57:30] um things in life has been my mentality
[57:33] and just be focused and be laser focus
[57:36] and right now I'm laser focused on
[57:38] bitcoin
[57:39] and and um making it happen right
[57:43] because I I see what's coming we see I
[57:46] don't know if it's in five years 10
[57:47] years 20 years but I know for a fact
[57:50] that you and me in five years 10 years
[57:52] are going to be very happy right we're
[57:54] going to be very happy and it's not too
[57:56] late is not too late because when I
[57:58] didn't understand Bitcoin 2021 when I
[58:02] saw that
[58:03] Spike I really didn't fully understand
[58:06] Bitcoin right and and I had some friends
[58:09] that were like no buy buy buy and I
[58:10] bought some Bitcoin at the alltime high
[58:12] back then at
[58:14] $74,000 but I was like ah come on it
[58:16] dropped down to 20 20 30 and I held
[58:19] through all that winter just because I
[58:21] didn't I didn't want to sell it I was
[58:23] like I might go back up to 100,000 and
[58:25] then it started really researching and
[58:26] when I started looking at the deeper
[58:28] math of biton and how really rare it is
[58:32] that's where that's where you actually
[58:34] clicks for you and you get orange
[58:36] spilled that's why they they say there's
[58:38] not X bitcoiners don't exist just
[58:43] there's just two type of people people
[58:44] that are bitcoiners and people that will
[58:46] be bitcoiners because there's no ex
[58:48] bitcoiners nobody that understands
[58:50] Bitcoin
[58:51] fully will reverse to a Fiat way of
[58:55] thinking
[58:56] just doesn't
[58:58] exist right
[59:00] so that's my two cents just be forward
[59:02] looking join the train join the arc book
[59:06] your place book your place in the arc
[59:08] really cool uh I love that message I
[59:12] 100% uh can subscribe to that um we have
[59:16] an entertain in the podcast where the
[59:18] previous guest is asking a question for
[59:20] next guest without knowing who the next
[59:21] guest actually is and uh your question
[59:24] from the previous guest is if bitcoin's
[59:27] value is derived from time what is the
[59:30] value of Bitcoin when we become immortal
[59:32] and our time becomes
[59:34] infinite oh wow that's a that's a b
[59:38] question uh time becomes infinite I
[59:41] would say you know just to make it easy
[59:45] a coin will be looked like a coin will
[59:47] be looked like a like a major Milestone
[59:51] like like unachievable Milestone like
[59:53] they will use that let's not even put it
[59:55] in money they will use that
[59:57] phrase like you know how we call it oh
[60:00] he's got a billion dollar smile or they
[60:02] he's got a billion dollar whatever it's
[60:04] going to be owning a coin it's going to
[60:06] be like this Divine thing you know where
[60:08] people are going to refer to it like oh
[60:11] wow that's like having a whole coin
[60:13] right like something happens in their
[60:15] life and they're GNA be they're gonna
[60:17] say like oh that's like having a whole
[60:18] coin or that's like winning how people
[60:20] say oh that's like winning the lottery
[60:22] people are going to say oh that's like
[60:24] having a whole coin that's just my
[60:26] that's just my perspective it's just
[60:28] going to be so high up that we we we
[60:31] cannot comprehend the how much it's
[60:33] going to be but it's going to
[60:36] be a term that people refer to as for
[60:39] the ultimate success or the ultimate uh
[60:43] goal interesting I like that it's it's
[60:47] it really shows and and shines a lot on
[60:50] that it's it's
[60:52] like when when we have infinite time
[60:54] because right now it's it's for me it's
[60:56] like we have time and Bitcoin that's the
[60:59] only two scarce things but if if time
[61:02] actually isn't that scarce anymore uh
[61:05] which would be a crazy thing to imagine
[61:07] then Bitcoin is the only thing that's
[61:08] actually valuable in the world that that
[61:11] would be that would be crazy crazy time
[61:13] to live it's already a crazy time what a
[61:15] time to be alive really cool huan for
[61:18] for being on the show before I let you
[61:20] go where can people find you ask your
[61:21] questions and reach out to you
[61:23] absolutely yeah how do I give my
[61:26] question for the next guest do I type it
[61:28] up
[61:29] or I'll just uh I I usually do it uh uh
[61:34] after the show but as as you brought it
[61:36] up uh let let's do it now let do do do
[61:39] you already have a question for for the
[61:40] next I do not well let me think no you
[61:45] can give it to me uh offline also like I
[61:47] usually try I I I do it that way because
[61:51] um I like to give the guest a little bit
[61:54] of a breathing room to think about a
[61:56] question like for at least a few seconds
[61:59] uh and not have it while they are uh in
[62:04] in the podcast wrap up yeah uh to give
[62:06] them a little bit more time to to think
[62:08] I actually have it I'm G give it to you
[62:10] right now touching on the touching on
[62:13] the point that I made uh of a whole
[62:15] coiner so the question would be what
[62:18] does it mean to be a whole coiner to you
[62:22] and what will it
[62:23] mean in 10 years from now
[62:26] that's my question and what will it mean
[62:31] in 10 10 years from now I love that I I
[62:37] I dip it directly up because I I forget
[62:39] otherwise have the video where it was
[62:42] and stuff like that uh that's an amazing
[62:44] question I think like whole C already is
[62:47] such a Prestige thing to be at um but in
[62:51] 10 years it will be just impossible to
[62:53] reach for most people that's just a pure
[62:56] hard reality like get now to one Bitcoin
[62:59] before it's too late exactly yeah and uh
[63:03] congrats on your podcast thanks for
[63:04] having me I know you you went
[63:07] exponentially up like Bitcoin you had a
[63:09] bull market in your Channel having
[63:11] sailor up and and I really liked um the
[63:15] Cardone Gary cardone's podcast with you
[63:18] that one was one of the best ones as
[63:19] well so congrats on it and it's funny
[63:23] cuz I played one of the clips of Sailor
[63:26] with you in one of the sales meetings
[63:28] that I had I don't know if you remember
[63:30] when sailor was talking about the the
[63:33] cancer cure and you had to be that sales
[63:35] Behavior where sales Behavior like that
[63:38] and people you could have their cure for
[63:40] cancer and then they they still won't
[63:42] buy it to you unless they slap you
[63:44] around and and they call you an an
[63:47] a-hole or whatever you know they that
[63:49] was a really good uh moment and and I
[63:51] used it for my sales meeting with the
[63:53] sales team a couple weeks ago so just
[63:55] want to shared that with you so that was
[63:56] a pretty good moment oh amazing thank
[63:59] you so much for sharing that with me I
[64:01] love that yeah like I think that clip
[64:05] should go to Every salesperson basically
[64:08] like it it has nothing to do with
[64:10] Bitcoin it's just about like how you
[64:13] should look at sales actually uh and
[64:16] yeah like uh this this was a small sales
[64:19] Master Class within a Bitcoin podcast
[64:22] and uh it's it's great that Micha gave
[64:24] that because he has a lot of of
[64:26] knowledge and wisdom to give Beyond
[64:29] Bitcoin in Bitcoin it's just so deep is
[64:33] thinking uh but like even Beyond Bitcoin
[64:37] like he was super rich before he
[64:39] discovered Bitcoin and he got there in
[64:42] the Fiat game without even understanding
[64:44] the monetary system as he explained he
[64:47] crashed the first time ever with Bitcoin
[64:48] what is money uh H so like it's really
[64:51] interesting to see how he got there and
[64:53] and what his mindset was and and the
[64:56] skills and experience he acquired
[64:57] because he was a billionaire before
[64:59] Bitcoin uh and now he's just getting
[65:02] even even richer with that and even
[65:03] wealthy with that uh but yeah we can we
[65:06] can learn a lot from him maybe because I
[65:09] I I will do a second round with with
[65:11] saor obviously um maybe the next podcast
[65:14] will maybe be focused actually on that
[65:16] what we can learn from saor outside of
[65:19] Bitcoin a little bit I think it would be
[65:21] a really cool episode too uh to get to
[65:23] get in there but maybe also there's some
[65:25] interesting topic in Bitcoin but yeah
[65:27] thank you so much uhan for for being on
[65:30] on the show it was really cool talking
[65:32] with you and yeah uh also thank you so
