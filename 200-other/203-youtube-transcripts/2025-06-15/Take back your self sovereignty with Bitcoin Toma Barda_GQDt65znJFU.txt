[00:00] imagine they tell you oh by the way your
[00:01] all your bank accounts are frozen it's
[00:03] gone the money is gone don't put an
[00:05] unnecessary Target on your back to take
[00:07] this power away from those Central
[00:09] entities and give people self-
[00:10] sovereignty it's a new era with Bitcoin
[00:13] wow this thing is going to change the
[00:14] world Bitcoin is a way for anyone to
[00:15] open the bank account in two
[00:17] seconds they actually love gamifying my
[00:21] life myself so when I heard about uh the
[00:25] wiser app and I saw it and you're like
[00:28] oh I can play a game can get educated
[00:31] with playing that app and taking the
[00:33] quizzes and getting the right answers
[00:36] and I even get satosi for that that
[00:39] sounds like an a really nice idea like
[00:41] where is this uh gamifying Bitcoin
[00:44] education coming from Wise that's uh the
[00:48] way you want to educate people and how
[00:51] do you do that with Wisa the the idea
[00:54] came from dualingo right so I was
[00:57] dualingo users and you know like at the
[01:00] way they
[01:01] teach languages I thought you know it's
[01:04] it's much better than the traditional
[01:05] way and you know from that I start we
[01:08] started I mean it's it was not just me
[01:10] right it's me and my team um so I'm a
[01:13] co-founder we're five co-founders so you
[01:15] know we have quite a diverse team uh
[01:17] that helps you know in terms of you know
[01:19] generating ideas and on the uh also for
[01:22] for operational stuff but uh so yeah so
[01:26] the idea came from dualingo we thought
[01:28] what makes them a bit special different
[01:30] is the way they're able to gamify the
[01:33] learning process and you know we saw a
[01:36] big big need for education in the
[01:38] Bitcoin space so maybe you know I can
[01:42] think story a bit back to you know how
[01:44] we we got into a the idea of of building
[01:47] wiser but you know initially I think
[01:49] like most people um I first heard about
[01:53] Bitcoin that was quite early actually my
[01:54] cousin founded a Bitcoin exchange in
[01:57] Canada so uh in 2015 so I heard about
[02:01] Bitcoin roughly 2013 14s obviously back
[02:04] in the days I was like what's that magic
[02:07] internet money was not interested at all
[02:09] I my my background is in the financial
[02:12] uh so in the traditional Finance uh
[02:14] industry I was working for private
[02:15] Equity then working for OBC so I was
[02:18] right very involved in the in the Fiat
[02:21] system so I I didn't been using that at
[02:23] all uh around 2015 I would say 15 16 um
[02:29] I started trading a bit because I was I
[02:31] would trade bit you know gambling you
[02:33] know buy some oil buy some you know S&P
[02:36] uh and then you know I saw this Bitcoin
[02:38] thing uh coming up and it was on my
[02:39] trading platform it was like a super
[02:41] basic trading platform and I saw you
[02:43] know it was going up a lot then going
[02:45] downlo there was a lot of uh volatility
[02:48] so I thought you know that's a good way
[02:49] to trade it so I started trading it um
[02:52] obviously that didn't work out for me
[02:55] then you know from there I saw you know
[02:56] J about perod you're about you know
[02:59] those other uh different coins and now
[03:02] during the Ico boom 201 16 17 um I also
[03:07] got a little bit involved I thought you
[03:09] know some of those have have have good
[03:11] utility or like good you know use cases
[03:14] um so I I thought there's potential and
[03:17] especially with my backgrounds in in in
[03:20] finance especially in VC know my focus
[03:22] you know in VC you focus on fundraising
[03:24] so I thought that's a great way to
[03:26] fundraise right it's such a so much less
[03:29] friction than the traditional
[03:30] fundraising process uh
[03:34] and from there you know I realized so
[03:37] from there I got into you know crypto
[03:40] cpto as you like to call it uh and then
[03:43] I realized you know some of the downfall
[03:45] that actually it's not you know that
[03:46] easy it's not that simple uh it's not
[03:48] just about the use case there's more
[03:50] than just you know does it have a good
[03:52] story is it easy to fundraise it's it's
[03:54] about you know what's what is the
[03:56] objective of the team behind it right
[03:58] what are they really trying to achieve
[04:00] what stops them from actually going out
[04:03] there and scam people uh and this is
[04:05] where you know the regulation aspect
[04:07] comes into play so there when you're a
[04:10] company a startup trying to fundraise
[04:13] there are regulation or rules that you
[04:14] need to follow but when you're crypto
[04:16] startup trying to fundraise especially
[04:18] with the Ico back in back in the days
[04:20] there was no rules you could just issue
[04:21] a token no disclosure no no no
[04:24] requirements to to to fund raise from
[04:28] accredited investors you could just you
[04:29] know issue a token someone can buy 10
[04:31] bucks of it and then you know that's it
[04:34] uh you didn't even have to disclose
[04:36] where's the money going like how where
[04:38] you know they send you 10 let's say a
[04:40] million people sends you 10 10 bucks
[04:42] right so you have1 millionar where is it
[04:44] what do you do with it you know who
[04:46] checks what you do with this money so
[04:48] from there you know I started realizing
[04:50] that more than the use case it's about
[04:53] it's about the efficacy of the people
[04:55] behind those project um and you know one
[04:59] thing L to the other uh we we met with
[05:01] the co-founders and we were all quite um
[05:05] quite passionate about Bitcoin but we
[05:07] saw that there was this issue about
[05:09] education and people would conflate
[05:11] Bitcoin with crypto and just you know
[05:14] box all of those things into one single
[05:17] let's say industry and we we our mission
[05:20] was to was to to start saying okay let's
[05:23] teach those people let's explain what's
[05:24] the difference uh between those
[05:27] different assets because in my op those
[05:29] are two very distinct asset classes one
[05:32] is obviously the commodity and crypto
[05:35] are obviously companies right it's I
[05:37] mean people will love to say they're not
[05:40] but it's really hard to argue that
[05:41] they're not companies actually one funny
[05:44] thing I I do when I'm you know trying to
[05:46] Orange bu people and they tell ask me
[05:48] about um you know those different crypto
[05:51] companies uh I tell them well you know
[05:54] one simple reason why they're not the
[05:55] same let's let's go through this for
[05:58] instance let's talk about ethereum right
[06:01] who's the founder of ethereum they'll be
[06:03] like oh theal all right cool no do they
[06:06] have like a a management team yeah there
[06:08] is you know this guy and that guy all
[06:09] right do they have a road map oh yeah
[06:11] yeah they're about to implement this
[06:12] thing and that thing I'm like yeah well
[06:14] you just describe a company right so
[06:17] that's just simple in Bitcoin there is
[06:19] no founder there is a Founder but he's
[06:21] not here there's no you know it's a it's
[06:22] a symbol right there's no management
[06:24] team there's no road map you know
[06:26] there's no it's it's an asset without an
[06:28] issue or there's no pre-sale right so oh
[06:31] one of the question I ask as well is oh
[06:32] did they do an Ico or a pre-sale right
[06:35] so you know ultimately you guide them to
[06:37] to understanding that one is just a
[06:40] company with a founding team that raised
[06:41] money and that put that money to work
[06:43] with a specific objective of the CH
[06:46] certain road maps company where the
[06:48] other on is an is more like gold is an
[06:50] asset without issue it's a it's a
[06:52] commodity that is out there that has
[06:55] specific rules that people cannot change
[06:57] and that can't be controlled so I think
[07:00] that was you know the the the idea
[07:02] behind uh behind wiser is to really
[07:04] bring to light um the difference in in
[07:08] those two asset classes um and getting
[07:10] back to your it was a long way to answer
[07:13] your your gameification question but
[07:16] getting back to that um we we thought
[07:19] what would be the best way to not just
[07:22] get people to to to learn but
[07:25] incentivize them because learning is
[07:26] always complicated it's always hard you
[07:28] know you always have to get like a
[07:30] cookie to people you know like a you
[07:32] have to reward them for to to to learn
[07:34] so that's how we thought about you know
[07:36] including gamification into the app and
[07:39] gamification is not just about the SATs
[07:41] rewards right so s rewards is one aspect
[07:44] of gamification but there's also the
[07:46] aspect of you know uh getting CS getting
[07:48] XP getting Level UPS uh and perks uh and
[07:52] more than that also there's a social
[07:53] element so we included
[07:56] leaderboards uh we included different
[07:58] sort of games and challenges
[08:00] so today actually we started uh our
[08:02] second Bitcoin games night so this is
[08:05] also something that is quite uh popular
[08:07] what we do is that we do a it's like a
[08:10] there's basically two phase there's an
[08:11] online uh qualif qualifier phase where
[08:15] everyone know plays answerers some quiz
[08:18] to to be in the final and then after
[08:20] those three days of qualification we do
[08:23] uh the top 10 gets invited to the final
[08:26] and this is you know uh live uh on on on
[08:29] the call where you know they compete and
[08:31] they're like different rounds and it's
[08:33] actually quite fun uh it's all around
[08:35] Bitcoin and financial education
[08:37] knowledge and at the end there's you
[08:38] know a big prize for the winner so this
[08:40] is how we gain a five it's more than
[08:42] just sat rewards it's engagement social
[08:45] activities and and other sort of sort of
[08:48] Doc
[08:49] heads is that your full-time project now
[08:53] so so you uh worked before in in the
[08:56] feed world with r capital as you said it
[08:59] uh and now you switched completely to a
[09:02] Bitcoin project and Bitcoin like you you
[09:04] also teach about Finance but it's like a
[09:06] Bitcoin uh project Bitcoin standard
[09:09] company how's that change going and you
[09:12] can also like uh what you just wanted to
[09:15] say like incorporate that in the answer
[09:17] if you want I we did take quite a leap
[09:19] of s but I think that's what Bitcoin
[09:21] does to you right it's once you start to
[09:24] understand that you're like wow this
[09:25] thing is going to change the world and
[09:27] you start to get passionate and you know
[09:29] just nothing else really matters at that
[09:32] stage so so we did take a Le State we uh
[09:35] started company year and a half ago it
[09:38] took us you know six month roughly to
[09:40] get to get the market uh and now we've
[09:43] had the app running for over a year so
[09:46] yeah it was uh it was quite an
[09:48] interesting um interesting uh Journey
[09:51] it's it's it hasn't been easy I'm never
[09:53] be a very honest right it's uh probably
[09:55] it's it's what every entrepreneur faces
[09:58] um and also the timing uh because you
[10:01] know where as we're a Bitcoin only
[10:04] company we don't do Ico we don't have
[10:06] tokens so that means that you know we
[10:08] have to raise through the traditional
[10:10] means so you know it's really like it's
[10:13] a it's a double edged sword right uh I'm
[10:16] sure we if we had a had had the token
[10:19] and had uh thought about uh and we
[10:22] teaching crypto would have probably did
[10:24] you know a fundraising and and raised a
[10:26] lot of money but you know we wanted to
[10:28] stay ethical so we we went through the
[10:30] the traditional BC route which was quite
[10:33] challenging in the last year uh as I'm
[10:36] sure you you've been aware of so you
[10:38] know we're still fundraising looking for
[10:40] uh for for for partners to help us grow
[10:44] so yeah it's been a fun
[10:47] Journey what's the business model behind
[10:49] it do you play ads or is it like there's
[10:51] some some uh subscription you can buy on
[10:54] there everyone was just annoyed by Those
[10:56] ads you know it's like oh whenever you
[10:58] get ad you have to 10 seconds just like
[11:00]  it so we we scra ads anyway we're
[11:03] not making that much uh that much money
[11:06] uh but we have several several
[11:08] monetization
[11:10] um Avenues the first one is subscription
[11:13] so we have subscription where user can
[11:15] subscribe to get additional uh Services
[11:18] obviously we want the main app to be
[11:19] free and the main education aspect to be
[11:21] free but we have you know things like
[11:23] Weekly News bites um and live Bitcoin
[11:26] classes as I mentioned earlier uh where
[11:29] we
[11:30] where you can subscribe and get those
[11:31] extra
[11:33] um extra features and that's one then we
[11:36] have uh Bitcoin only sponsorships so
[11:39] that's you know we work with Bitcoin
[11:40] only companies that uh would you know do
[11:43] product placement at the end of of of
[11:45] specific FES um yeah so those are the
[11:49] two main area of monetization we're also
[11:51] working with several um other companies
[11:54] and and people to try to get into
[11:56] schools and universities so we have a
[11:58] quite a a big partnership that we're
[12:00] going to be announcing uh soon uh I'm
[12:03] not sure if I can say it now depending
[12:05] on when this is going to air but it's
[12:07] with one of the biggest you know
[12:08] educator in South America I'm sure if
[12:11] you're getting the reference that teach
[12:12] us you know with the book um so you know
[12:15] we're get announc this partnership and
[12:18] hopefully you know we can get to schools
[12:20] um and potentially you know get some uh
[12:22] some monetization aspect from that
[12:26] side that's really cool I think a lot of
[12:28] bitco ERS that are in the space um still
[12:33] or they're working in a fiure I mean
[12:35] there are a lot of bitcoiners that like
[12:37] their usual normal job that has nothing
[12:39] to do with Bitcoin like that's also the
[12:41] the thing of Bitcoin it's it's not
[12:43] something everybody has to work on it's
[12:46] it's like gold is like digital gold and
[12:48] you can just save your money in there
[12:50] it's like a protocol where you can do
[12:52] whatever you want with it uh so not
[12:54] every Bitcoin has to work on bitcoin but
[12:56] I think there's like a big amount of
[12:59] bitcoiners with an entrepreneural spirit
[13:02] that want to get into the community
[13:05] build something and it's like uh they
[13:08] they want to contribute something to
[13:11] community some are just like content
[13:13] creators like myself some are just
[13:15] building apps some are just doing
[13:17] different stuff uh maybe like you you
[13:20] have a unique perspective now because
[13:22] you started this like one and a half
[13:24] years
[13:26] ago if you said like half a year develop
[13:29] one year is not an app live uh what what
[13:32] would you say to people that are now
[13:33] like on the edge like they have an idea
[13:36] they want to do it but they're not sure
[13:38] they they're on the edge of that leap
[13:40] front that you said
[13:43] uh what is uh have as ADV wise and maybe
[13:46] take us a little bit to your founding
[13:49] story and then it's like maybe there are
[13:51] like some challenges and interesting
[13:53] stories on the way you can tell 100%
[13:56] what I would say to to start with is if
[13:58] you have a job quit your job to start
[14:00] you know and jump straight into it you
[14:02] know do it gradually there you know an
[14:04] idea work on it over the weekend you
[14:06] know spend you know your nights on it
[14:08] and slowly you know ease into it and
[14:11] that would provide you know it will it
[14:14] will make it easier on you both in terms
[14:16] of you know Financial uh on the
[14:18] financial side but also mentally right
[14:20] so you don't have that stress of of
[14:22] saying right I need to do this to do
[14:24] this otherwise you know I'm going to be
[14:25] I'm not going to know how I'm going to
[14:27] feed myself for the next few a few month
[14:29] so I would say gradually ease into it it
[14:32] definitely helps to to to have
[14:35] co-founders because you know getting
[14:36] into a journey with other people that
[14:38] are equally passionate helps because
[14:40] sometimes you're going to be down uh and
[14:42] you know your co-founder is going to
[14:43] lift you up sometimes it's going to be
[14:45] the other way around right the co is
[14:46] going to be down you're going to be the
[14:47] one lifting lifting him up or her up so
[14:50] it's it's always interesting to to to
[14:53] come in with someone someone else and I
[14:55] would say it's important to have you
[14:56] know technical uh someone that is that
[14:59] has technical background depends
[15:01] obviously on on what sort of uh company
[15:04] you want you want to build let's say if
[15:06] if it has to do something with apps or
[15:08] you know uh with building act product it
[15:11] it would be it's always good to have uh
[15:13] a technical person involved and I would
[15:16] say on your cap table that would be even
[15:18] more useful because you know Outsourcing
[15:20] the development it can become a big
[15:22] problem it's going to cost you money
[15:24] you're going to have people that are not
[15:25] very uh involved or not very um
[15:28] incentivized is to to work for the long
[15:31] run and then you know those people can
[15:32] always cut you off any any moment if you
[15:34] don't understand how to handle the code
[15:37] so I would say you know that this is
[15:38] obviously the basics but then know in
[15:40] terms of where is their potential I
[15:43] think there's huge potential in many
[15:45] different areas uh many different
[15:47] industries that could be uh impacted by
[15:49] uh by Bitcoin it it's really important
[15:52] to see first you know what is it that
[15:53] you're passionate about know it could be
[15:55] you know educating it could be uh you
[15:57] know helping people that have that you
[16:01] know that have that don't have access to
[16:03] to to financial services so helping
[16:06] under Bank people it could be uh about
[16:08] you know teaching the kids it could be
[16:10] about building a product for DJ gamblers
[16:13] I mean you know you're gonna have a bid
[16:14] of everything so it's finding something
[16:16] that you're passionate about trying to
[16:18] understand how can Bitcoin help in that
[16:21] field and just not getting started it's
[16:24] never going to be easy it's always going
[16:25] to be tough especially the first few
[16:27] years um but I think having a clear
[16:31] monetization uh objective is is
[16:33] definitely going to help is
[16:34] understanding based on this idea how do
[16:36] I monetize um and what is your total
[16:40] addressable Market if you if you know if
[16:42] you're doing something where the the
[16:43] addressable Market is is five people
[16:46] it's probably not going to be taking it
[16:47] very far so you have to see how can I
[16:50] get to to to an addressable Market that
[16:53] makes sense but then you know I think
[16:55] there's two ways to to look at any sort
[16:57] of business uh there's you know going
[16:59] the Venture route meaning you know for
[17:01] Venture back business you're going to
[17:03] have to think how do I get 100 million
[17:05] in sales right if you can't get a 100
[17:07] million in sales right you're probably
[17:09] not going to be Venture backed but then
[17:10] there are other businesses where you
[17:11] don't need to to do 100 million sales
[17:13] they could be you know uh com uh
[17:16] projects where you don't take on too
[17:18] much uh investment you know they you
[17:20] build it for yourself maybe to uh you
[17:22] and your co-founder and you know you
[17:24] generate maybe a million a year and you
[17:25] know that's that's quite quite good you
[17:27] make that 10 20%
[17:29] uh a profit margin and you know that
[17:31] sustains you depending on you know on
[17:33] your goals but you know you have to
[17:35] understand what which way and which
[17:37] route you're going because those are two
[17:38] very different routes um yeah so I think
[17:41] those are the key elements do something
[17:43] that you love understand what is your
[17:46] end goal uh what is the addressable
[17:48] market and and thinking about
[17:49] monetization very early on don't you
[17:52] know back in the days it was easy to get
[17:54] funded uh with just an idea and say you
[17:56] know we'll figure out the monetization
[17:58] later down the road and now that money
[18:00] is a bit tighter it getting to
[18:03] monetization proving that you're able to
[18:05] to generate Revenue becomes more
[18:08] essential yeah it's so it's so important
[18:10] that you have uh not only waer but maybe
[18:15] you can even like see small steps of it
[18:18] like if you have an app and you have
[18:19] already like the first few users or like
[18:22] at least like in list we and like oh
[18:25] they want to they prepared to be in this
[18:27] app and how this is how I can
[18:29] monetize uh it's it's always interesting
[18:31] I talked also you probably know relay
[18:34] the the Bitcoin
[18:36] exchange and I talked with the
[18:39] co-founder Adam uh I also talked with
[18:42] with the other co-founder Julian but the
[18:45] Adam told a really interesting story
[18:47] they like uh they founded the company
[18:50] with like they got found founding for
[18:52] like 15,000 uh Euros uh and they took us
[18:58] them like they're like now three months
[19:00] we trying that out and in that three
[19:02] months they builded that and it was
[19:05] interesting for me because there are
[19:08] there are companies that are
[19:10] non-existing and they just like let's
[19:12] try it out and if you're young I think
[19:13] you can definitely do it uh but there
[19:16] has to be something behind because they
[19:18] have been in developing of the strategy
[19:21] for like a year and then they took a
[19:23] leap um they didn't had a lot at that
[19:26] time but they had some C they had some
[19:28] users they had some email things they
[19:30] had some uh no code app before they had
[19:34] some interesting people like they had
[19:36] they didn't started with zero and I
[19:38] think that's important before you go
[19:40] ahead quick everything and go to this
[19:42] whole entrepreneurs I mean it's also
[19:45] possible way but I don't expect to make
[19:48] money anytime
[19:50] soon it's hard that you think it takes
[19:53] longer than you think all your
[19:54] projection are going to be off by a
[19:56] couple years so be prepared don't don't
[19:59] let this because otherwise you're just
[20:00] going to be too stressed yeah Reay
[20:03] beautiful yeah beautiful story Reay
[20:04] they're crushing it I think they R their
[20:06] CB I think they're they're on great on
[20:09] the great path so really love what those
[20:12] guys are building I'm I'm using I'm a
[20:13] user of of freay so really love it now
[20:16] with the lightning integration so great
[20:19] product they they really good um in
[20:23] order to have the app and you educate
[20:26] people you have to cure it and I think
[20:28] this is one of the hardest things to do
[20:31] you have to Cur all the information
[20:33] about Bitcoin and get it into the app
[20:36] and not only get the right information
[20:39] but also cut out the information that is
[20:42] uh not necessary because if you just
[20:44] like you have too much information in
[20:46] there it gets long it gets messy and
[20:48] it's like bad how do you curate all the
[20:51] right information and then present it in
[20:55] a way people like to learn it that is
[20:59] that is a tough question you're asking
[21:01] here this is probably the hardest thing
[21:03] right that we' had to do and I'm going
[21:06] to be honest you know we had uh we we
[21:08] had some trial and error we started for
[21:11] instance I will give you one some simple
[21:13] example of something that been work ta
[21:15] is that we were using the word crypto
[21:17] right so we were saying no crypto wallet
[21:19] you know or just use the word crypto and
[21:21] people started lashing like going crazy
[21:23] on us and like well this is not a
[21:24] Bitcoin a company how can you use the
[21:26] word crypto like okay well sorry we'll
[21:28] just stay well completely crypto out of
[21:31] the all those classes but at the end of
[21:33] the day you know it's it's it's it's a
[21:35] tough thing to to Cur it because as you
[21:37] said right how do you curate without
[21:39] providing your own bias so you know I
[21:43] think it's it's about understanding who
[21:45] your who's your target market based on
[21:47] your target market you're GNA have to
[21:49] I'm saying okay well if my target market
[21:51] are Bitcoin only people um this is how
[21:54] I'm going to have to speak however if my
[21:56] target market or no coiners that Trans
[21:58] on board into Bitcoin we have to give
[22:00] oursel a bit more leeway right we can't
[22:02] be as strict we can't be as you know uh
[22:06] as Maxi as some of the people would like
[22:09] us to be so what we're trying to do is
[22:11] really trying to take a an objective
[22:14] approach I would say trying to only be
[22:16] factual right so we're trying not to put
[22:19] our own opinion into that but just be
[22:20] factual right how does a how does
[22:22] Bitcoin work this is how it works right
[22:25] there's no opinion based on that um and
[22:28] of course this put you can extend that
[22:31] to the basics but as you go deeper and
[22:33] deeper it becomes more and more
[22:35] complicated because you know then you
[22:37] get into for instance you know some of
[22:38] the conversations that are happening
[22:39] today in Bitcoin right pal filters uh
[22:42] Covenant right so what what you do about
[22:45] that how do you explain that without
[22:47] taking inside so I think it's all about
[22:49] explaining the
[22:51] underlying principle or the underlying
[22:54] technology without saying whether it's
[22:56] good or bad it's just saying what it is
[22:59] so I think this is the approach we've
[23:01] been taking so you know even when we um
[23:04] uh you know we spoke about many topics
[23:07] that I would say are a bit touchy but we
[23:09] always do it in a in a neutral way we uh
[23:12] you know bid FM for instance was was
[23:14] quite a touchy topic but we just
[23:16] explained said this is no this is how it
[23:18] works this is what it does those are the
[23:20] risk those are the potential rewards you
[23:23] know it's for you to make up your own
[23:24] mind we're not going to tell you what to
[23:26] think we're just going to bring you the
[23:28] facts uh behind the stories so I think
[23:31] this is how we we trate that and you
[23:33] know I'm lucky to to have great
[23:34] co-founders uh with us so you know we
[23:38] split you know that that that work um
[23:41] and we have different views you know we
[23:43] have uh we have diversity uh in in in
[23:46] our backgrounds you know we have women
[23:49] as well in in the team so you know we
[23:51] and different backgrounds different
[23:52] ethnicities and so forth so it does help
[23:55] to to bring about a more Global um view
[23:58] of what's going on and how to how to
[24:01] explain those topics to different type
[24:03] of of
[24:05] people uh that's amazing it's like when
[24:08] you have so many different angles you
[24:12] can explain Bitcoin and you have so many
[24:15] different topics you can cover in
[24:17] Bitcoin and uh like it it it's an
[24:21] overwhelming task I think uh when you
[24:23] have to do it and you have to trial
[24:25] error and do it over and over again it's
[24:27] like but it's uh something that is worth
[24:30] doing because you might get some people
[24:34] out there that actually understand
[24:35] Bitcoin and then get into the whole
[24:37] rabbit hole then get into all the things
[24:39] and you might improve someone's lives
[24:42] and even the possibility of that and
[24:45] probably the app already did that uh but
[24:48] even the possibility of that is amazing
[24:50] I think that's something worth standing
[24:52] up for the success story is people you
[24:54] know that came in uh and ultimately on
[24:58] understood that the we're about to get
[25:00] scammed in in a few different projects
[25:02] and you know came out focused on bitcoin
[25:05] and then know those project went to zero
[25:07] and they're like oh thank God I saw I
[25:10] figured this out before before the rug
[25:11] pole uh so yeah we have some of those
[25:14] great stories and know people teaching
[25:15] and using the app uh uh to teach their
[25:18] own Community especially in uh in in
[25:21] Africa uh I can't remember that's really
[25:23] a shame uh but we have someone that
[25:25] really supports Us in in in Africa
[25:27] that's been using our app to teach his
[25:29] own Community uh maybe in the set I'll
[25:32] send you his name and his tag because he
[25:34] really does an unbelievable job uh so
[25:37] yeah we're people are using our app to
[25:38] teach our community and and this is
[25:40] actually what you know we're foremost
[25:43] proud of is is this aspect of being a
[25:45] tool for empowerment across different
[25:48] regions and you know
[25:50] globally it's amazing um you also write
[25:54] a lot about uh on on on Twitter and your
[25:57] post and I read through your uh read
[26:01] through your highlights and I liked it
[26:04] so much because there is this one word
[26:06] and it's not in every tweet but it's
[26:08] just like this one theme it's like
[26:10] staying humble and and then don't don't
[26:14] tell anyone uh don't tell everybody how
[26:17] much Bitcoin do you have don't tell I
[26:20] told you so stay humble keep your mouth
[26:22] shot and uh when when I read this is
[26:26] like something oh that's a bitco who
[26:28] gets it who that's a bitcoiner who
[26:32] understands that uh bragging and this
[26:34] fear mindset and this uh whole whole
[26:38] whole thing we have in Fiat is not the
[26:41] way to go it's it's it's it's a new era
[26:44] with Bitcoin uh uh don't put an
[26:47] unnecessary Target on your back uh when
[26:50] you don't want to put that on the back
[26:52] it's like how did you get that every uh
[26:56] since a long time or is this something
[26:57] Bitcoin told you Bitcoin teach you 100%
[27:01] Bitcoin 100% Bitcoin so I think that's
[27:04] you know that's the beauty Bitcoin right
[27:06] it it humbles you really fast because as
[27:08] I said you know I started getting into
[27:10] Bitcoin in 15 so I was riding the waves
[27:13] in 17 17 18 right and then boom you know
[27:17] so that's that's when you really learn
[27:19] that there's so much volatility in this
[27:21] game like it goes up it goes down you
[27:23] know so there's no point in talking in
[27:26] talking too much the more you talk this
[27:28] is also maybe I'm a bit superstitious
[27:30] but I feel like every time I brag every
[27:32] time I'm like hey look at Bitcoin the
[27:34] next day it crashes right obviously
[27:36] that's not that's not the case I'm not
[27:38] that powerful but I feel like you know
[27:40] there's some sort of like Karma around
[27:42] if you talk too much about the price
[27:44] going up and you show off too much you
[27:46] know you're gonna get bitten so that's
[27:48] the way you know that's something I I
[27:50] kind of want to explain to people is
[27:52] that the Fiat gains are nice but firstly
[27:56] Until you realize them it it they're no
[27:59] gains right uh they're not really gains
[28:01] if it's a number on your on your phone
[28:03] it's not a game uh and then secondly
[28:05] like if you do realize them then you're
[28:07] you're out of the game as well right if
[28:09] you take out an exit and get into Fiat
[28:11] so the price is is not as much as
[28:15] important as the the mission right so
[28:17] it's not about you know flexing on
[28:19] people and saying oh look look at my
[28:21] holding it's more about you know how can
[28:23] this technology make an impact how can
[28:26] we solve some of the biggest because
[28:29] this I think it's one of the few
[28:31] technologies that is really looking to
[28:33] solve one of the biggest issues that we
[28:36] have in the world right now because some
[28:38] people say money is the root of all evil
[28:40] but that's not true money is not the
[28:41] root of of all evil it's the way we we
[28:44] weaponize money that that becomes a
[28:46] problem we use money to to to enslave
[28:49] people right and this can be seen with
[28:51] many different organization but I'm not
[28:53] going to mention all of them but you
[28:54] know there ways we use money to in ens
[28:58] slave and and and you know and and put
[29:01] pressure and do things to people that
[29:04] are not necessarily in their best
[29:05] interest and I think the the whole
[29:07] objective of Bitcoin is to take this
[29:10] power away from those you know Central
[29:12] entities or you know those this Elites
[29:15] um and bring that bring and give people
[29:18] self- sovereignty and I think if your
[29:20] only objective is to say okay I'm G to
[29:23] take my Bitcoin and you know it's going
[29:24] to go to a million dollar I'm going to
[29:25] sell and buy two Lambos then you're
[29:28] you're not getting it you're not
[29:29] understanding the the value of of of
[29:31] Bitcoin and more than that if that's the
[29:33] way you think about it at 50k you're out
[29:35] 100K you're out 500k you're definitely
[29:38] out of the game you know you're not
[29:39] going to last with this mentality you're
[29:41] not going to be able to sustain so I
[29:43] think this is this is something we see a
[29:46] lot with with people that are that just
[29:48] came into Bitcoin they just came in they
[29:50] started buying you maybe a year ago a
[29:52] year and a half ago and you know they
[29:54] they they're seeing their first goal run
[29:55] and they're getting excited and I think
[29:57] it's normal you know the first time I I
[29:59] was like that I I saw a blow run I was
[30:01] shouting to everyone look at me I'm a
[30:03] genius look at me I'm a genius and then
[30:05] you know one year later I was a
[30:09] so it's it's about understanding you
[30:12] know uh that it's a longterm game it's a
[30:14] long-term game and
[30:17] and until you know
[30:19] we I'm not even sure when we're going to
[30:22] get out like when you can start to
[30:23] celebrate I think of course you know
[30:25] when I post those things a lot people
[30:27] tell me yeah you can't be that strict
[30:29] you know there's you have to celebrate
[30:31] small wins you know that's what keeps
[30:33] you going you know small wins and this
[30:34] and that and sure you can celebrate
[30:36] those small wins but I think you should
[30:38] celebrate them internally you should be
[30:40] happy you know with yourself and say oh
[30:41] that's good that's a positive sign but
[30:44] going you know and bragging about that
[30:45] going to to to to people that invest in
[30:48] other stuff and say haha you're a loser
[30:50] I'm smarter than you doesn't bring any
[30:53] value to you to the community you know
[30:55] to anything it just gives gives them you
[30:57] know
[30:59] a tool to to beat you when when when the
[31:02] price goes down so I think ultimately I
[31:04] think it was Marty who who said who
[31:07] initially coined the phrase stay humble
[31:10] and stack STS but it's one that I like
[31:13] to to to to take was all I'm super
[31:17] excited to announce that this podcast
[31:19] got the first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is
[31:24] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[31:27] and preach self custody this is my goto
[31:30] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[31:33] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[31:35] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[31:38] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[31:41] support this podcast use code Robin and
[31:44] click the link in the description I I
[31:46] just this question just came up in my
[31:48] mind what's the difference actually
[31:50] between bragging and celebration like
[31:52] because for I never thought about that
[31:55] but when you celebrate something uh with
[31:58] friends and you're like oh I reached
[31:59] that Milestone and you like for example
[32:03] I don't know you built a company and you
[32:05] got your first million uh users in the
[32:08] app and you're like this is an
[32:09] achievement I worked so hard for in my
[32:11] life and I want to celebrate with my
[32:13] best friends but it's also kind of a
[32:15] bragging when you really look at it like
[32:18] you you you show off to your friends I
[32:20] mean the mindset and the intentions are
[32:22] different probably but it could be also
[32:24] understood as bragging how do you see
[32:26] that I think I it's it's a good point
[32:28] you're bringing here like you know it's
[32:30] a I would say bragging is when you're
[32:32] trying to put other people down and
[32:34] trying to put yourself up and
[32:36] celebrating is when when you you don't
[32:39] have this in mind you're just like happy
[32:41] and you celebrate something and
[32:42] achievement and and you do it without
[32:44] necessarily trying to put people down
[32:46] bragging is is more like haha look look
[32:48] at me I did it you're stupid this is
[32:50] kind of bragging and celebrating and
[32:52] saying you know oh that's amazing you
[32:54] know we're we're Bitcoin is up it's
[32:57] going to allow me you know to to support
[32:59] my family support my parents you're you
[33:02] know help those kids help you know those
[33:04] animals whatever you know it is that
[33:06] you're you're doing I think this is a
[33:08] celebration is using uh is using the
[33:11] positive to bring more positive whereas
[33:14] bragging is using the positive to create
[33:16] negative emotions right so I would say
[33:18] that that's probably the way I see the
[33:20] difference because of course you know
[33:22] when Bitcoin if one day Bitcoin will go
[33:24] up I'm I'm pretty sure of that uh and
[33:27] and I'm going to be doing good things
[33:28] but I'm not going to be trying to put
[33:30] people down I'm going to try to help and
[33:32] know bring you know joy and and
[33:34] happiness to the people that don't
[33:35] necessarly uh had the same opportunity
[33:39] and I would say that is more celebration
[33:40] of the success of Bitcoin but I know
[33:43] people that soon as as this goes up the
[33:46] first thing they're going to do is call
[33:47] their friends and and tell them how
[33:48] smart they are and how dumb the other
[33:51] person is you know and that's that's a
[33:54] different
[33:55] mentality yeah I usually practice
[33:58] telling bit uh telling people about
[34:01] Bitcoin more when the price is down um
[34:04] and uh like in in the starting I was
[34:07] telling everybody about Bitcoin no
[34:09] matter what the pric is then I went more
[34:11] to like uh I only tell uh people when
[34:15] it's like a little down and not on the
[34:17] top uh but it's really hard because
[34:19] people ask when it's on the top and I'm
[34:21] not when it's now I'm completely
[34:24] switched where I'm like I have my social
[34:26] media everybody in my my family and
[34:28] friends and all my environment knows I'm
[34:30] the Bitcoin guy uh so people
[34:34] automatically come to me when they have
[34:36] questions that they want to know where
[34:38] can I buy all this beginner questions so
[34:40] this is really interesting way like yeah
[34:43] I I stay out of the orange billing I
[34:45] orange build only people that are
[34:47] actually interested in Orange billing
[34:48] because you cannot force anybody to
[34:50] bitcoin and I think uh WIS is an
[34:53] interesting approach to that because
[34:55] it's just an app where you can send
[34:57] people and they can learn about Bitcoin
[35:00] in in a more fun way because you can
[35:04] also send them podcast you can also send
[35:06] them books uh and I always recommend
[35:10] first send them something video and easy
[35:13] to
[35:14] consume or an app or something that's
[35:17] like that that gets easier because if
[35:19] you send them a book first uh they if if
[35:22] they read a lot of books they probably
[35:24] have a list of 10 books they want to
[35:27] read first and if they don't read a lot
[35:28] of books they probably don't read that
[35:30] book also so book is a big hurle and
[35:33] they need a lot of motivation to get
[35:35] through this uh it's like an interesting
[35:39] approach I like the the approach that we
[35:41] gamify with an app yeah and back maybe
[35:44] one last point on on on the bragging and
[35:47] and humbleness I think also if you do
[35:49] want to Bragg and if you do want to
[35:51] sound you know like the smartest person
[35:53] I think I made a tweet where it says
[35:54] like you know when Bitcoin is up and
[35:57] you're I think it was for Thanksgiving
[35:58] or for Christmas you know talking about
[36:00] when you're going to gather with your iy
[36:01] and Bitcoin was up I think at that time
[36:03] I said you know what the biggest Flex is
[36:05] is actually it's it's not to go and say
[36:06] to everyone look at Bitcoin is actually
[36:09] everyone knowing that you're in Bitcoin
[36:10] everyone knowing that you crushed it in
[36:12] the last couple months but just coming
[36:13] and saying nothing about it that is
[36:15] actually a much stronger Flex right
[36:17] because people like why is he not
[36:18] talking about it he should be talking
[36:20] about but he's not it's just like hear a
[36:22] smiling having a good time and you know
[36:24] that's actually the biggest fact it's
[36:26] people to know that you crushed it but
[36:29] you don't say anything about it that is
[36:32] amazing point I love that I will I will
[36:34] clip that in the
[36:37] beginning good one that should be heard
[36:40] by everyone and unfortunately uh only
[36:44] only a small percentage make it to the
[36:46] end so like usually between 20 and 30%
[36:48] make it to the end so I will qu
[36:52] beginning oh thank you H what do you
[36:55] think uh um is is the most important
[36:58] like if if someone um gets through
[37:01] podcast and maybe they're a little bit
[37:02] newer to to bitcoin what's what's the
[37:05] most important thing about Bitcoin you
[37:08] want everybody to understand interesting
[37:11] um I think there's two things that are
[37:14] crucial for people to understand and I
[37:16] think those are the two things that are
[37:18] the most talked about but also
[37:20] misunderstood things and it's also a
[37:22] tweet that I want to make when Joe from
[37:24] you know CNBC or CNN whatever one of
[37:27] those uh one of those channels as is
[37:30] quat Joe squack when he was speaking
[37:32] with Gary gamler uh and there were two
[37:35] points that came up came up and
[37:38] obviously Joe is defending Bitcoin but I
[37:40] think he didn't do a great job because
[37:43] those were are crucial items that
[37:45] complet kind of missed the point which
[37:47] is number one the decentralization of
[37:49] Bitcoin and number two the utility of
[37:51] Bitcoin because I think those are the
[37:53] two kind of cor like crucial elements of
[37:56] Bitcoin because people don't really
[37:58] understand what it means oh something is
[38:00] decentralized and what's the what what
[38:02] is the impact of decentralization on the
[38:05] asset itself right so when people talk
[38:07] about
[38:08] decentralization there's a lot of
[38:10] confusion to what does it mean is is is
[38:12] it the mining that is decentralized is
[38:14] it the coin ownership that is
[38:15] decentralized that people don't
[38:17] understand that it's actually an
[38:18] interplay between three different actors
[38:20] there's the miners there are the full
[38:22] nodes and there are the coin holders and
[38:25] because those three different entities
[38:27] have diverging or different incentive
[38:30] mechanism and they all need to somehow
[38:32] collaborate it's hard for any of one of
[38:35] those entity to centralize and to take
[38:38] control right miners have an incentive
[38:40] to you know get
[38:42] rewards full notes have an incentive to
[38:45] keep you know the chain or you know the
[38:47] time chain as uh as clear and
[38:51] as censorship resistant and coin holders
[38:55] have a incentive to maximize their their
[38:57] their their holding their profit and you
[38:59] know when you put those different actors
[39:02] together it's really that what that's
[39:03] what brings centralization because you
[39:05] know we saw with block size War uh of
[39:07] 2015 to 17 that uh miners by themselves
[39:10] don't have the power to control the
[39:12] chain and this is what we saw we saw
[39:13] that full nodes were able to actually uh
[39:16] block the the increase in in in the
[39:18] block size why because for them it
[39:21] didn't make sense for them because if
[39:22] you want to run the full node you want
[39:24] decentralization of the nodes block size
[39:27] um
[39:29] uh larger block size would would be
[39:32] actually a detriment to that so they
[39:34] block this this element and then of
[39:36] course what they try to do they try to
[39:38] do a hard for right they try to hard for
[39:40] with the system and that's when you see
[39:41] the interplay with the coin holders so
[39:43] now you're a coin holder you have the
[39:45] two coins right you have the old uh the
[39:47] coin on your old chain and then you have
[39:49] the coin on the new chain and then
[39:50] that's for you to make a economical
[39:52] decision what are you going to do which
[39:54] one are you going to sell because
[39:55] obviously you're going to believe that
[39:56] one's
[39:57] work and the other one's not going to
[39:59] work so you're going to want to sell the
[40:00] one that doesn't work and here by
[40:01] selling the coin that you don't believe
[40:03] in it's going to influence the
[40:05] proability of mining on that you know
[40:07] it's going to affect the value the value
[40:09] of the of the chain and ultimately the
[40:11] profitability if there is no
[40:13] transactions so this is the you know the
[40:16] interface that ensures decentralization
[40:18] I think this is something that is very
[40:20] very misunderstood uh out there people
[40:22] don't really understand what full nodes
[40:24] have to do with anything uh so I would
[40:26] say that's the first and the second I
[40:28] mentioned was the utility people you
[40:30] know and that was a point that Gary
[40:33] brought up they were like yeah what's
[40:34] the utility there's no utility I'm like
[40:36] there is no utility this guy is is
[40:39] literally like how do you how do you say
[40:41] it nicely but basically he's uh he he
[40:46] doesn't understand because he's such in
[40:48] a privileged position in life that he
[40:50] doesn't really understand the the
[40:51] utility of of of a monetary system that
[40:54] is not that cannot be cered that cannot
[40:57] be
[40:57] controlled I'm from leanon right so I
[41:00] don't know two two and a half three
[41:02] years AG from one day to the next they
[41:05] blocked all banks blocked your your your
[41:08] bank account so people like my family
[41:11] lives in mon people had you know like
[41:14] any it's like a normal day and then the
[41:16] next day imagine they tell you oh by the
[41:18] way your all your bank accounts are
[41:20] frozen it's gone the money is gone just
[41:22] disappeared and it's not third world
[41:24] country right it's Lebanon it's Beirut
[41:27] like it's it's it was it's quite an
[41:29] advanced an advanced City you know it's
[41:31] a uh you expect some sort of stability
[41:34] obviously it's not the most stable but
[41:36] you expect some sort no one expected
[41:38] that to happen um so that's you know
[41:41] something that how can you say there's
[41:42] no utility it's money that can't be
[41:44] controlled that can't be cous that can't
[41:46] be you know confiscated and does that
[41:48] only happen in rabadan no you saw this
[41:50] happen in Canada right with during the
[41:53] the the chucker protest you started
[41:54] freezing bank accounts in Canada so
[41:57] there clearly and so those are two
[42:00] examples but we can go on and on right
[42:02] there even countries being banned from
[42:03] the Swift I'm not going to mention the
[42:05] country because I don't know if
[42:07] YouTube's going to be happy with that
[42:09] but there are country whole countries
[42:10] are being you know B in the Swift are
[42:13] being sanctioned and then individuals
[42:15] from those countries and you know all
[42:17] over the place so money is being used
[42:20] the financial system is being used uh is
[42:23] is being weaponized against the people
[42:25] and this is one crazy use cases having a
[42:30] money that that can't be confiscated
[42:33] right then you have a second utility
[42:35] which is the financial uh Financial
[42:38] inclusion so if you look at spe
[42:41] specifically and those are all things
[42:42] that Gary doesn't understand because
[42:44] clearly he's not he doesn't have any of
[42:46] those issues being the head of the SEC
[42:48] in in the US but if you look at
[42:50] developing countries not everyone has
[42:52] access to to bank account or you know to
[42:55] the financial system it's comp people
[42:57] don't have the paper the you know
[43:00] documents to to to open bank accounts uh
[43:02] Bank obviously favor people with a lot
[43:05] of money it doesn't make economical
[43:07] sense for them start opening bank
[43:09] account to people that you know can't
[43:11] afford to have money in there can't
[43:12] afford to buy their product come afford
[43:14] to pay the fees so for them you know
[43:16] they're going to obviously favoritee
[43:17] people that have a lot of money so you
[43:20] you Bitcoin is a way for anyone to open
[43:22] the bank account in two seconds take a
[43:24] phone download app boom I have a bank
[43:26] account then I can trade I can open this
[43:29] Bank down and trade from with anyone
[43:31] from across the world in 2 minutes I can
[43:33] send it to that right how is that not
[43:35] the great use case a utility for Bitcoin
[43:38] so I mean those are you know two
[43:39] utilities and then you know we can talk
[43:41] about we can talk about utilities all
[43:42] day long but the third one is is is the
[43:45] fact that it's a bare asset right so
[43:46] it's the only be asset like gold and
[43:50] that's actually a post I tweet I posted
[43:53] today but it's actually the only bare
[43:55] asset like gold that has absolute scar
[43:57] but can be transferred right cross
[44:00] borders without
[44:02] any without asking permission and let's
[44:06] say without storage cost and without
[44:09] having to
[44:10] to to to go through costom or so forth
[44:14] right so you can literally have a seat
[44:15] phrase memorize the words have like a
[44:17] billion dollar and go from the US to I
[44:20] don't know India or to any country in
[44:23] the world without having to to ask
[44:25] permission without having to you know go
[44:27] through a bunch of of of of of barriers
[44:32] to move your wealth so this is also
[44:34] quite a solid use case so I would say
[44:36] you know all those things combined make
[44:38] that make quite quite strong uh
[44:41] utilities for Bitcoin I think this is
[44:43] also something quite misunderstood spe
[44:45] specifically from uh people that don't
[44:48] have those sort of uh problems so I
[44:50] think those are cral elements for people
[44:52] to un and that's amazing did you live in
[44:55] Lebanon when this happened or was it
[44:57] just a family connections no I was luy I
[45:00] was not I was not there I grew up uh in
[45:03] uh in Europe uh but like my whole family
[45:06] is there right half of my family is uh
[45:08] is is is living there so uh it was
[45:11] extremely hard for them it's like from
[45:13] one day to next they stopped the thing
[45:15] and they any new money so so because
[45:18] they traded mostly in dollars right most
[45:20] people C dollars uh in in in Lebanon it
[45:24] was kind of like the second currency and
[45:26] uh so your old dollars were called you
[45:28] know just old dollars and any new money
[45:31] was called like fresh money fresh dollar
[45:33] like they had a new name different
[45:35] accounts for the fresh money like it was
[45:37] a whole like nonsense things that they
[45:40] that they were able to to to to create
[45:43] and and people were really struggling so
[45:45] even if you wanted to take out let's
[45:48] say some of your money because at some
[45:51] point they started you know uh saying
[45:53] that you can send money and then even
[45:55] that money that you take out so if
[45:56] you're receive money in dollar let's say
[45:58] fresh dollars you want to take it out
[46:00] you could only get like you would get a
[46:02] fraction bit so let's say you take out
[46:04] 100 but it cost you $200 uh in on your
[46:07] bank account so it was a whole disaster
[46:10] for people and some people are you know
[46:11] their whole life savings uh in Banks um
[46:14] and you know the whole system collapsed
[46:16] and I think couple months later there
[46:18] was like an explosion or something so
[46:20] like it was um you know this big
[46:22] explosure that was also a big disaster
[46:24] for the country so it was tough for them
[46:26] and and we getting uh and that's
[46:29] actually something that I'm surprised
[46:31] people
[46:33] don't don't understand Bitcoin as much
[46:35] as they should in in in this country
[46:37] because they're they're literally the a
[46:40] place where everyone should understand
[46:41] the value of Bitcoin but still still
[46:44] they they they're a bit like which is
[46:47] quite
[46:49] weird you you you have to have the pain
[46:52] to understand it and they had the pain
[46:54] but you also have to
[46:57] um Crush some fear mindset some
[47:01] learnings you had along the way in your
[47:03] mind you have to unlearn things and be
[47:06] ready to learn something new so it's
[47:09] it's I think the pain helps to
[47:11] understand because like how do people
[47:15] learn new stuff either they they they
[47:18] fall in love with something or they hate
[47:20] something or they have a lot of pain
[47:23] have a big incentive and there has to be
[47:25] something big for people to shift in a
[47:27] big way and money is so fundamental to
[47:30] us right it's it's it's big area uh and
[47:34] fundamental to to us and so yeah they
[47:36] you really have to shift something yeah
[47:38] but I think also one thing is that
[47:40] sometimes when you have so many problems
[47:42] you know like you're just trying to
[47:43] survive right you're we we're lucky you
[47:45] know we're extremely lucky we're in your
[47:47] top you know percentage of you know
[47:50] there are very few of us that would say
[47:51] you know that have this this luxury of
[47:53] having the time to think and sit down
[47:55] and you know just trying to to
[47:57] philosophy on on on what money is it's
[48:00] something that we're it's a luxury so
[48:02] some people are just like listen I'm
[48:04] just trying to survive here I just need
[48:05] to make money today so I can feed my
[48:07] family and you know buy clothes and and
[48:10] just make sure that everything is fine I
[48:12] don't have time to learn what money is I
[48:14] don't really care right now give me US
[48:16] dollar I'll be fine I'll buy some food
[48:17] and some water and that's all I need so
[48:20] I I there's also this aspect right is
[48:23] you need to be a certain you know
[48:25] certain level of of of
[48:28] um you know of of not wealth but having
[48:32] some sort of comfort certain level of
[48:33] comfort before you can start to really
[48:35] question the system and start to go
[48:37] against it because it does take it does
[48:40] take Financial Resources to fight the
[48:42] system you can't just fight it you know
[48:43] with with no no Financial Resources the
[48:46] way you know I like to say is that I
[48:47] don't fight uh I don't fight the war
[48:50] physically I just fight it with my money
[48:52] you know I just sell sell Fat Self fat
[48:55] every every month I sell all the I can
[48:57] and this is my way to fight it's not
[48:59] it's not physical it's it's Financial so
[49:02] yeah it's it's funny for me when I think
[49:05] about that because um for me the fat
[49:09] system and how you describe it people
[49:11] cannot really save in anything and
[49:14] people are just trying to make as much
[49:16] money so they can get food and
[49:19] shelter and when you think back to
[49:22] actual
[49:24] slavery uh or to actual
[49:27] um servants Servants of like Rich
[49:30] households what they were what did they
[49:32] got provided they got a house next to
[49:35] the the good house was servant's house
[49:38] and they got provided with food and
[49:40] shelter that's it and most people cannot
[49:44] have they don't have more and they're
[49:47] like w but they can choose where they
[49:48] work yes they can choose but do they
[49:51] really have a choice it's an illusion of
[49:54] choice but that's something exactly
[49:55] something we're seeing that lot of
[49:57] people are realizing it's like I'm I
[49:59] work a job right to make money and that
[50:03] money the only thing I can do with that
[50:04] money is basically pay for clothes to go
[50:06] to the job say pay for a car that gets
[50:08] me to the job pay for food to sustain me
[50:11] to be a the job I basically I'm working
[50:14] to pay for things that are only just for
[50:16] the work I'm doing so like I'm really
[50:18] not getting anything I'm getting no
[50:20] added value here like all the money I'm
[50:22] making is being kind of used to make it
[50:25] so like what's the point the terminal
[50:27] value is zero right make money to use it
[50:29] to make it no point so a lot of people
[50:31] are realizing this uh that it's actually
[50:34] and I saw this this funny meme I'm not
[50:36] sure if it's true or not you can't trust
[50:38] anything these days but like there was a
[50:40] meme saying like you back in the day
[50:42] slave had like you know four months of
[50:44] holiday and would stop work at like 6 PM
[50:47] because you know the the the the master
[50:50] would know that uh you know they need to
[50:52] be well rested in order to do a good job
[50:55] right it's probably safe but it's it
[50:57] does speak a bit of you know the the way
[51:00] people uh are let's
[51:03] say used these days to to achieve bigger
[51:07] objectives of of the elite I'm
[51:10] think and I think it's also like an an
[51:13] delicate uh topic because there were
[51:17] slavery back in the day that was way
[51:20] worse than any uh 9 to5 wage slavery
[51:25] kind of going on
[51:27] but uh it's it's it's still not a good
[51:30] system that prefers people that uh to
[51:34] hard work because if you work hard you
[51:36] should get rewarded obviously if you
[51:38] maybe do the wrong work like but there
[51:41] so many exceptions to that but uh you
[51:43] you should have something more and this
[51:46] fundamental problem with the money
[51:48] you're saving in something that someone
[51:51] else steals through inflation from you
[51:55] and we cannot EX we cannot say oh but he
[51:59] he or she can invest money like yes but
[52:02] why does he has to do that why does
[52:04] everybody has to be a portfolio
[52:09] manager yeah things that slow that right
[52:12] slow death is is something that people
[52:14] don't uh uh they they like
[52:17] predictability know they like the
[52:19] predictability of M I'm going to lose 5%
[52:21] on inflation per year but I know that's
[52:23] predictable so it's people like
[52:26] predictability let like the story of the
[52:28] frog in the boiling water
[52:30] right yeah in that context uh oh by the
[52:35] way the frog in the water I heard
[52:37] because you mentioned right now I heard
[52:39] uh that it's actually not true I don't
[52:42] know if that's
[52:44] true I just saw a random video somewhere
[52:47] on on the
[52:51] internet complet underrated I think it
[52:53] was like five years ago there was some
[52:56] uh a doctor that made that experiment
[52:58] and just like actually put a frog in the
[53:00] water and and he realized he has the
[53:03] Frog he Chumps out no matter how
[53:06] long at some point that pain is too much
[53:09] and he Chumps out it's unbelievable you
[53:11] can't trust anything you see on the
[53:13] internet displ
[53:15] nothing yeah it's it's but it's still a
[53:18] good analogy I think because uh I think
[53:20] a lot of people stay in and I think this
[53:23] is even extended over the fat monetary
[53:26] system it's extended to life they're
[53:28] staying in toxic relationships they're
[53:29] staying in toxic workplaces and all this
[53:32] stuff but it's
[53:36] yeah it's it's it's it's a massive time
[53:38] but you should champ out if the pain is
[53:40] too much as the Frog also does
[53:43] yeah in the context the the actual
[53:46] question I wanted to ask you is uh what
[53:49] what is Financial Freedom for you when
[53:52] we we see all the fear and Bitcoin going
[53:55] on we see wage slav we see
[53:57] entrepreneurship we see all the
[53:59] different aspects you can do in the
[54:00] world and all the different areas where
[54:03] people are also in um when when does
[54:06] someone reach a status of being
[54:10] financially free to life right I don't
[54:12] think there's there's a one answer fits
[54:15] all but I think uh Financial Freedom I
[54:18] would say is there's two ways right of
[54:22] of of of seeing this thing but I think
[54:24] they all lead to to the same thing is
[54:26] doing what you love if you can do what
[54:28] you love you're you're some way
[54:31] financially free because why do people
[54:33] do a job that they don't like or they
[54:35] don't like or they don't love sorry is
[54:38] because they need the money to do
[54:39] something else right so this is what
[54:42] what I what this is the opposite of
[54:44] being financially free is doing
[54:46] something that you dislike to get the
[54:48] money so that you could buy and survive
[54:51] I think Financial Freedom and means
[54:53] having the ability to do what you love
[54:56] so either it's you love your you know
[54:59] your your your a job you actually have a
[55:01] job so you could be you know I don't
[55:03] know uh an artist you could be an
[55:05] educator you could be anything any job a
[55:09] teacher whatever and you actually love
[55:11] that and so you're you're you're
[55:13] financially free because uh you have the
[55:16] freedom to do what you love or it could
[55:18] be you know through passive income you
[55:20] have enough uh income that you have you
[55:22] know some sort of a
[55:25] uh freedom to actually not have to do
[55:28] something dislike now why is Bitcoin
[55:31] relevant in in in this Financial Freedom
[55:34] aspect is because Bitcoin is probably
[55:36] the only asset that can't be taken away
[55:39] from you I think it's back to this idea
[55:41] of not being something that can't be
[55:43] conf uh confiscated and something that
[55:45] can't be inflated away right is that
[55:48] sure you could say well my objective is
[55:50] to own a property and then with that
[55:52] property I'm going to rent it out and
[55:54] then yeah I'm financially free
[55:56] but here there's many things that you
[55:58] need to take into account I mean
[56:00] depending on which country you live in
[56:01] there's going to be huge amount of taxes
[56:03] right if you live in most European
[56:05] country you you get tax on property
[56:07] there property tax so you lose you know
[56:08] certain certain percentage of your house
[56:11] uh every year so you have to pay for it
[56:12] then if you rents it out you have to you
[56:14] know pay taxes on on on the income you
[56:17] make then you know if you pass pass away
[56:20] and have to give it to your kid also
[56:21] there's inheritance tax right uh so
[56:23] those are all the sort of taxes that you
[56:25] have to pay on top of that if tomorrow
[56:27] you say something that the government
[56:28] doesn't like they can take it away if
[56:30] tomorrow there is you know the the the
[56:33] the political situation changes in the
[56:35] country I it turns communist or it turns
[56:37] you know with a different uh different
[56:39] political group you could also either
[56:42] lose it have to pay more taxes so it's
[56:44] somehow it's there's a lot of
[56:46] uncertainty behind those zero real
[56:48] estate asset and this is the same you
[56:51] know with savings you have in your bank
[56:52] or with any sort of investment you're
[56:54] going to make there's always this sort
[56:55] of central a the sort of third party
[56:58] that actually controls your your your
[57:00] investment you only have it as long as
[57:03] they want you to have it right your
[57:04] house is only yours as long as the
[57:06] government says it's yours tomorrow they
[57:07] say it's not yours it's not yours your
[57:09] bank accounts proof are being Lebanon
[57:12] they say it's not yours it's not yours
[57:14] so this is what we mean by Bitcoin being
[57:16] Financial Freedom and self Sovereign is
[57:18] that no one can with it right it's
[57:20] it's yours no one can steal it obviously
[57:22] this means if you keep it in self-
[57:24] custody because obviously a c if you're
[57:26] if you if you hold it in custy with
[57:29] FTX it's not yours anymore either right
[57:32] but uh this is what also self custy is a
[57:35] crucial element that we discuss maybe
[57:36] later but once you're holding self
[57:39] custody is yours and and this is the
[57:41] ultimate Financial Freedom it's it's the
[57:43] ability to know that regardless of what
[57:46] happens around you this is mine no one
[57:48] can mess with
[57:51] it I think sth cast is actually a really
[57:54] good point here to get it because if
[57:57] you're Financial free and you have um
[57:59] savings and you have Financial power if
[58:02] you give that Financial power um to
[58:05] someone else which is uh in case FDX or
[58:09] any exchange even if we talk before
[58:12] relay there are also other really cool
[58:15] Bitcoin only exchange like1 Bitcoin and
[58:17] stuff like that but no matter who you
[58:19] give it to they have it not legally but
[58:23] physically they have it and they can up
[58:26] they can steal it they can do whatever
[58:28] they want with it because physically
[58:29] they have it and you don't have it you
[58:31] only have like an i you have an an right
[58:34] to have it but if you don't have it like
[58:37] you just have a piece of paper then so
[58:40] it's it's self-cast is really important
[58:43] and maybe question for you and um why do
[58:47] you think people still don't get the
[58:50] importance of self- custody even though
[58:52] we had so many events in the last years
[58:55] that teach SE custy with Celsius FDX is
[58:58] like I I I once took uh an history of
[59:03] that and made a tweet and there's like
[59:06] 50 companies or something like that
[59:08] there's so many events that went on uh
[59:13] people they don't trust themselves
[59:16] that's not they don't trust themselves
[59:18] that's it they they okay this might
[59:20] happen it hasn't happened to me it
[59:22] happened once you know in the Blue Moon
[59:24] they just think the chances of me losing
[59:26] my seat phrase is higher than the
[59:28] chances of binance or whatever coinbase
[59:30] going down right this is what they think
[59:32] they don't trust themselves uh enough to
[59:34] self customy um and this is something I
[59:37] see with people around me there's a lot
[59:39] of my friends that are holding their
[59:42] coin on some sort of centralized
[59:43] exchange and as much as I explained to
[59:45] them listen you might lose it all
[59:47] they're like
[59:49] yeah it's okay like I'm like no it's not
[59:52] okay but like it's hard because they
[59:54] just don't trust themselves so used to
[59:56] this idea of custodian of someone
[59:59] holding your assets for you and they
[60:01] just think you know it's going to be
[60:02] fine they just you know believe that you
[60:04] know the chances are higher that they
[60:06] will mess up rather than you know a
[60:09] binance messing up or a coinbase messing
[60:11] up or Robin hoods whatever messing up so
[60:14] I think it's a that was the main issue
[60:17] uh and it's just also they don't really
[60:19] understand how to use self custody
[60:21] properly a lot of the people I speak
[60:23] with and this those are people that have
[60:24] no substantial amount of of of of money
[60:27] in in in uh in Bitcoin they don't
[60:31] understand how a wallet works
[60:32] specifically how a seed phrase work they
[60:34] think you know the the your Bitcoin is
[60:37] attached to specific in in in self
[60:39] custody right they think that your SE
[60:41] phrase is attached a specific wallet
[60:43] like oh my uh my thing is in this wallet
[60:45] or in that wallet I'm like no they're
[60:47] not in either wallet they they're on the
[60:49] blockchain and the wallet is just a
[60:51] device that you use to access to open
[60:54] the door to the to to the to the
[60:56] blockchain to uh to the to you know to
[60:59] see what's what's held by the address
[61:01] that's all you do it's it's not in there
[61:04] so I think there's also this
[61:05] misconception that's you know a lot of
[61:07] misconception I think it's really but
[61:09] let's be fair it's not that simple it's
[61:11] it's it's it really it's really it's not
[61:14] that simple to understand you need to to
[61:16] learn take hours to to to dig into it to
[61:20] understand the intricacies of you
[61:22] know 90% of the people that are in to
[61:26] bitcoin they won't understand what's the
[61:28] difference between a private key and a
[61:29] seat phrase and how what which one is
[61:32] derived from which b39 they have no idea
[61:34] what bit 39 is and how it introduced you
[61:37] know seat phrases so it ain't that easy
[61:40] you have to really want to learn about
[61:41] it so I think what we need to do is find
[61:44] ways to improve let's say the UI
[61:47] potentially you know improve the the T
[61:49] elements of of what it means to to self
[61:53] custody so yeah
[61:56] so one one big example that I want to
[61:58] mention is people using Hardware wallets
[62:01] that make me laugh because they're like
[62:03] yeah the hard they don't understand that
[62:05] the hardware wet is is is is actually
[62:07] relevant what matter is is the private
[62:09] cure the seat pH however you you decide
[62:12] to store it and they're like yeah but I
[62:14] have my Hardware wallet here and there
[62:16] I'm like yeah but that's irrelevant
[62:17] where's your seat phrase because anyway
[62:19] you have to back it up you know somehow
[62:21] right this is what matters the other one
[62:23] you can throw it away it's okay it
[62:25] doesn't matter so this huge
[62:29] misconception and and there's where most
[62:31] people actually I think mess it up when
[62:35] because they they get the hardware
[62:37] wallet they do all the stuff and then
[62:39] they put their seat phrase on
[62:45] iel Exchange or they don't write it down
[62:48] they're like they don't write it down
[62:50] they're just like it's fine I have the
[62:52] hardware will but I'm no that's that's
[62:54] not important the most important is like
[62:56] literally the hard World reset it every
[62:58] time you reset it it's just like I mean
[63:00] depends how how crazy you are but know
[63:03] like this is not what matters
[63:06] here but yeah it's fun it's a fun
[63:08] absolutely
[63:10] 100% I just want to touch on one point
[63:12] for yourself yeah sorry go
[63:15] on no no no you go on I would
[63:19] change actually yeah that actually comes
[63:23] up a lot when we speak about Bitcoin
[63:25] self- custody and you know Financial uh
[63:29] sovereignty uh is a lot of people say
[63:34] well like people don't have enough money
[63:38] to worry about saving like Bitcoin is
[63:40] not a solution because it's too volatile
[63:42] and they don't have money know like most
[63:45] people don't save right saving is is not
[63:48] something that most people do most
[63:50] people end up the month with zero they
[63:52] don't have any ability to save uh and
[63:54] know they're they're in debt so I think
[63:56] this is something I want to bring up
[63:58] because it's I haven't I don't have the
[64:00] answer to this yet you know I'm being
[64:02] frank it's it's something that I think
[64:04] about a lot is how do we help those
[64:06] people that actually do not have the
[64:08] ability to save um so it's something
[64:11] that you know I try to to think about
[64:13] and I try to find solutions for you know
[64:17] it it's not going to be a solution at
[64:20] least a mental solution of saying know
[64:22] this is the way to become self-
[64:24] sovereign to become financially depend
[64:26] even if you know you're in a situation
[64:29] where you cannot save because those are
[64:32] the type of people that will say well
[64:33] you know what I only have 100 bucks or a
[64:35] thousand bucks I'm not going to put in
[64:37] Bitcoin I'm gonna gamble I'm gonna try
[64:39] to make a 100x with this you know uh a
[64:42] shitcoin because anyway what's a th000
[64:44] bucks can do 2,000 bucks I'm I'm never
[64:47] getting out of this mess so I think this
[64:49] is the most or the segment that I'm
[64:52] trying to focus on the most right now is
[64:54] because you know the the rich ones it's
[64:55] easy I just no save DCA you know you're
[64:58] going to be fine uh but what do we say
[65:00] to people that don't have the stability
[65:02] to to DCA that don't have dis ability to
[65:04] save uh how do we convince them that
[65:06] Bitcoin is a great solution and is going
[65:09] to help them so I think this is an open
[65:12] question in my
[65:13] mind that's an amazing question and uh I
[65:17] have the end routine where the previous
[65:20] guest asked a question for the next
[65:22] guest I think this would be maybe an a
[65:24] question can form it uh form it however
[65:28] you want it afterwards uh that you can
[65:30] give then to the the next guest and he
[65:33] some a
[65:36] question yes someone has a question for
[65:41] you before we come to that I
[65:44] just I just uh before I um uh come to
[65:50] the end routine I just want to quickly
[65:52] ask you um where uh what what's coming
[65:56] for yourself and what's coming for wiser
[65:58] in the next couple of year are you
[66:00] working on any exciting new projects uh
[66:03] and yeah what's coming yeah we're
[66:05] working on something pretty cool um I
[66:08] don't want to talk too much about it
[66:09] because you know uh it's a it's a it's a
[66:12] tough Market out there and it's and in
[66:14] Bitcoin not very easy to for people to
[66:17] replicate what you're doing but um it's
[66:19] touching basically on on on kind of this
[66:22] uh class of people that don't
[66:23] necessarily have the ability to to do
[66:26] Unchained stuff because of the fee level
[66:29] um so yeah so we're working on some new
[66:31] additions to to the platform it's going
[66:33] to come out very soon so yeah but
[66:36] ultimately you know our goal is
[66:37] education is free education keeping you
[66:40] know keep educating the mes and and
[66:43] Target developing countries South
[66:45] America uh Africa uh southeast Asia and
[66:49] so forth because you know we feel that
[66:51] those are people that needed the most uh
[66:53] because of their their the situation
[66:55] with their country this the UN you know
[66:58] their country are unstable you know in
[66:59] terms of financial uh opportunities and
[67:04] we would love to see help them
[67:07] basically give tools to empower them
[67:09] that's
[67:10] amazing yeah that's that's an an amazing
[67:13] mission to be on and maybe the podcast
[67:16] will come out in around three weeks so
[67:18] maybe I can just link it when it's out
[67:20] then at that time and U I'm looking
[67:23] forward what you up to and what you're
[67:25] doing
[67:26] and now coming now coming to the end
[67:29] routine uh so the previous guest had a
[67:32] question for you uh if you were forced
[67:35] to do something creative for Bitcoin
[67:38] like painting wood crafting song
[67:40] Whatever creative you want to do or even
[67:43] yeah writing a code or something like
[67:45] that could also be considered creative
[67:47] um what would you do right now the
[67:49] question I'm going to ask the next guest
[67:51] now that's simple question I would do a
[67:55] nice
[67:56] a nice painting I like to paint it
[67:58] relaxes my mind so I would I would like
[68:01] to do a nice little um art piece on
[68:04] bitcoin maybe a little
[68:08] sculpture yeah SC Bitcoin sculpture that
[68:11] would be really fun I
[68:13] think really really cool um Tom thank

[68:20] don't know you who wants maybe to be in
