[00:00] $250,000 Bitcoin $100,000 Bitcoin $1
[00:02] million Bitcoin those things are much
[00:04] closer than they appear because of the
[00:06] realities of this accelerating debt
[00:09] problem that the United States is facing
[00:10] if we end up going with the Bitcoin Act
[00:12] of 2024 and we do end up buying 1
[00:14] million Bitcoin over the course of 5
[00:15] years that would be absolutely massive
[00:17] for the United States but all Trump
[00:18] needs to do on day one is sign an
[00:20] executive order basically reestablishing
[00:21] our existing 200,000 Bitcoin as our
[00:23] strategic Bitcoin reserve the headline
[00:25] of that alone is enough to send Bitcoin
[00:27] blazing right past 100K again towards $
[00:30] 110 $125,000 in really short order we're
[00:32] basically in a Bitcoin Cold War right
[00:34] now where basically we're waiting on the
[00:36] other guy to press the button and start
[00:38] accumulating Bitcoin and once one of
[00:39] them does then all of a sudden it's Off
[00:40] to the Races and it's a Bitcoin arms
[00:42] race to accumulate as much Bitcoin as
[00:44] fast as we can it's going to be a very
[00:45] wild 2025 it's tough to see how Bitcoin
[00:47] ends the year anywhere lower than like
[00:49] $150,000 monetary debasement is the path
[00:51] of lease resistance in order to fund the
[00:53] US government as a result you want to
[00:55] own the best hedge against monetary
[00:57] debasement and time and again over the
[00:58] last decade that's been Bitcoin if gold
[01:00] is $30 trillion by the time Bitcoin it
[01:03] usurps it then Bitcoin is $1.5 million
[01:06] per coin in the next 5 years Bitcoin is
[01:08] inevitable because we can't stop
[01:09] printing money the prospect of Donald
[01:11] Trump saying all right the United States
[01:12] is now going to be buying Bitcoin
[01:14] actively that's going to be much more
[01:15] widely publicized both on right-wing
[01:17] media and on leftwing
[01:18] [Music]
[01:22] media before we start in the whole topic
[01:25] of strategic pitco reserve and all the
[01:27] things that that we we kind of want to
[01:29] discuss today with markets um before I
[01:32] want to ask you what in general do you
[01:35] expect from
[01:36] 2025 how do you look at this year this
[01:40] coming year and what do you kind of
[01:41] expect for
[01:42] that right so I mean it's going to be a
[01:45] banner year it's going to be another
[01:46] banner year for Bitcoin right 2024 is
[01:48] fantastic we went from you know at the
[01:50] start of the Year sub 40K to uh you know
[01:53] 98k ending the year right so we Rose you
[01:56] know 200% um you know I have a feeling
[02:00] that we'll do a very similar thing this
[02:01] year um if you take a look at upside
[02:04] targets like 150,000 um dollars those
[02:07] aren't very far Out Of Reach whatsoever
[02:09] obviously Bitcoin right now is really
[02:10] struggling to get back above 100K um
[02:13] that's just a function of what's
[02:15] happening in the broader economy and
[02:17] with interest rates um economic data is
[02:19] coming in very good as a result um
[02:22] growth expectations are rising interest
[02:24] rates are rising and so the cost of
[02:25] capital right the cost of borrowing and
[02:27] lending across the US economy um is
[02:30] rising and so it's making it harder to
[02:32] do business as those yields get more
[02:33] attractive people are selling risk
[02:35] assets buying treasuries right so that's
[02:38] like that's what Bitcoin is facing right
[02:40] now that's the one big headwind but I
[02:43] believe that once Trump gets into office
[02:45] um he's going to use that kind of like
[02:47] um a negotiation tool of sorts with
[02:49] other countries um and also with the
[02:51] Federal Reserve right we have this very
[02:53] strong economy we have yields through
[02:55] the roof um you know and he's always
[02:58] been somebody who even when the the
[02:59] economy is hot he wants rates to come
[03:01] down even more during his presidency
[03:03] he's notorious for telling Jerome Powell
[03:05] over Twitter that rates need to be
[03:07] negative they need to be cut below zero
[03:09] so I expect more of the same um because
[03:11] ultimately that's what Trump cares about
[03:14] more than anything he cares about you
[03:15] know the American people but he also
[03:16] cares about the US economy as measured
[03:18] by GDP so he wants that thing to to rip
[03:21] for all four years of his term so he has
[03:22] something to brag about so um I think
[03:24] that once Trump gets into office yields
[03:26] will probably come back down and then it
[03:28] will be a better day for risk assets
[03:30] Bitcoin included but for the time being
[03:32] Bitcoin is kind of attempting to scale
[03:34] this wall of spiking yields um and it's
[03:38] not doing a very good job at it it's
[03:40] interesting um uh because when like
[03:44] before no president really was big on
[03:47] bitcoin uh he's kind of the first one
[03:50] that is at least speaking a lot about it
[03:52] and there's always this midterm election
[03:54] thing I'm not an expert of American
[03:56] politics but I I have a feeling that the
[03:58] midterms are also really important so
[04:00] all two years and when you follow the
[04:03] Bitcoin cycle midterms uh Bitcoin
[04:07] usually crashes in that time it doesn't
[04:09] has to be uh but maybe he really wants
[04:12] to prevent that uh with low interest
[04:15] rates with a lot of money supply maybe
[04:17] he can uh manipulate the market in that
[04:20] area to the upwards uh but yeah that's
[04:23] that's just the interesting thought that
[04:24] I had right now um that's really
[04:27] interesting when we think about now
[04:29] nation states coming into the game just
[04:32] like four or five years ago we had the
[04:34] first publicly traded company coming
[04:36] into the game now we have a lot of them
[04:38] uh what do you expect for the the
[04:40] Strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh and maybe
[04:42] nation state game theory kicking off so
[04:45] it's really incredible right um you know
[04:47] four years ago now at Bitcoin 2021
[04:50] obviously naibu Kelly um of El Salvador
[04:53] announced that they would be buying
[04:54] Bitcoin they made it you know legal
[04:56] tender as a result of that they would
[04:58] have a reserve of it they're buying five
[05:00] every single day or one every single day
[05:02] whatever it is and they've been doing
[05:03] that for the last you know coming on
[05:04] four years so they were the first nation
[05:06] to do that obviously at the time it was
[05:08] a little bit outlandish it was um you
[05:11] know right after Bitcoin had uh risen
[05:13] all the way up to 60k and then crashed
[05:15] back down to 40 or 45 um and now you
[05:18] fast forward not even four years on um
[05:22] the kingdom of Bhutan is revealed to be
[05:24] one of the largest Bitcoin holders
[05:25] obviously we still have El Salvador
[05:28] Russia now is speaking about
[05:30] establishing a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[05:31] in response to the United States rumors
[05:33] of the
[05:34] usbr um and one thing I know about Trump
[05:37] and everybody knows about Trump is he's
[05:38] a very competitive guy um if you whisper
[05:41] in his ear that Vladimir Putin is going
[05:42] to buy all the Bitcoin before you he's
[05:44] gonna want to buy all the Bitcoin before
[05:45] him right so that's basically what we're
[05:48] facing now um is the prospect of
[05:50] obviously look the US fiscal situation
[05:52] is extremely dire we're running a debt
[05:55] to GDP ratio of uh you know close to
[05:57] 120% we're running deficit that are you
[06:00] know going to be closing in on $2
[06:01] trillion annually by the end of this
[06:03] year with the way that interest expenses
[06:04] running so High um we have a deficit is
[06:07] a percentage of GDP of
[06:09] 7% which means that if we if we kicked
[06:12] out the entire deficit if we stopped
[06:13] spending more money than we have the
[06:15] economy would crumble and so we're in
[06:16] this really precarious situation where
[06:18] we rely so much on debt the US has
[06:20] needed Bitcoin now more than ever if we
[06:22] end up going with the Bitcoin Act of
[06:24] 2024 if it gets passed resoundingly by
[06:26] people on both the Republican and the
[06:28] Democrat side um and we do end up buying
[06:30] 1 million Bitcoin over the course of
[06:32] five years holding it for 20 years in
[06:33] order to attempt to pay down some of our
[06:36] national debt um that would be
[06:38] absolutely massive for the United States
[06:39] but even without the Bitcoin actor 2024
[06:42] I still think it's possible for Trump to
[06:43] establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve um
[06:46] for viewers of your show a lot of them
[06:47] may already know this but some of them
[06:48] might not the United States is already
[06:50] the country that holds the most Bitcoin
[06:52] we have 200,000 Bitcoin um being held
[06:55] and that's from um you know seizing them
[06:57] from Criminal operations or they were
[06:59] said to be criminal operations like the
[07:01] Silk Road obviously um and uh you know
[07:04] other various things uh asset forfeiture
[07:07] and now we have 200,000 Bitcoin all
[07:08] Trump needs to do on day one is sign an
[07:11] executive order basically reestablishing
[07:13] our existing 200,000 Bitcoin as their
[07:15] strategic Bitcoin reserve and they're
[07:17] just like that we have a strategic
[07:18] Bitcoin reserve the headline of that
[07:20] alone right is enough to send Bitcoin
[07:22] you know BL blazing right past 100K
[07:25] again towards 110 $125,000 in really
[07:27] short order if he decides to do that um
[07:30] if he does you know see friction with
[07:32] trying to pass the Bitcoin Act of 2024
[07:34] um he could also use the exchange
[07:35] stabilization fund framework this is
[07:37] something that Matt Pines and the
[07:39] Bitcoin policy Institute have spoken
[07:41] about is basically using the existing
[07:43] framework um of uh this exchange
[07:46] stabilization Fund in order to um
[07:48] purchase Bitcoin right in order to sell
[07:49] the gold we have in the exchange
[07:51] stabilization fund and purchase Bitcoin
[07:53] with it he can do that with executive
[07:55] order on day one and the Bitcoin policy
[07:57] Institute has actually already drafted
[07:59] the executive order that he could use
[08:00] it's literally plug andplay all he has
[08:02] to do is take what they've already
[08:03] written plug it in sign it um and we
[08:06] have a strategic Bitcoin reserve on day
[08:07] one so even without the Bitcoin Act of
[08:09] 2024 the prospect of this is looming um
[08:12] and so not even just let's let's you
[08:14] know take a look at the second order
[08:15] effects not just price implications for
[08:17] this thing what about Game Theory you
[08:18] asked about Game Theory um well we know
[08:20] Russia China India and a few and several
[08:22] others now um are trying to create this
[08:25] basket of currencies so they can do
[08:27] trade in a currency that is not dollars
[08:29] um we know that gold um is not the
[08:33] currency they can use to back that
[08:35] basket of currencies they've already
[08:36] spoken about the shortcomings of gold um
[08:38] how because it is physical it would
[08:40] literally be impossible um to settle
[08:43] trade in Gold it just cannot happen or
[08:45] have their currency backed by gold um
[08:48] but this committee right this bricks
[08:51] committee has brought up the prospect of
[08:53] using Bitcoin to back this basket of
[08:54] currencies and so while I myself am a
[08:57] bit of a dollar bull right I believe
[08:58] that the dollar is going to continue to
[09:00] trounce all Fiat as it has for the last
[09:02] um you know 80 years over the next 80
[09:05] years and 100 years um I do believe that
[09:07] you know while it is the king of Fiat
[09:08] it's the King on top of the trash sheep
[09:10] right all Fiat is inevitably going to
[09:12] die in the vine um and really I think
[09:14] you know at the end of all this the
[09:15] dollar will remain King that said the
[09:18] prospect of some of the world's
[09:20] strongest countries that are ancillary
[09:22] to the United States that are not the
[09:23] United States um purchasing a lot of
[09:26] Bitcoin in order to back this brand new
[09:28] currency they're trying to create um is
[09:30] pretty enticing it's a very interesting
[09:32] Prospect um and you you couple that you
[09:35] couple the the dynamic of both sides
[09:37] right basically the United States and
[09:39] its allies wanting to purchase Bitcoin
[09:42] for itself and the United States enemies
[09:45] right China Russia and the like wanting
[09:47] to potentially adopt Bitcoin um it's
[09:51] essentially like we're we're basically
[09:52] in a Bitcoin Cold War right now where
[09:54] basically we're waiting on the other guy
[09:56] to press the button and start
[09:58] accumulating Bitcoin um and once one of
[10:00] them does or once the prospect of one of
[10:03] the countries buying Bitcoin comes to
[10:04] such a fever pitch that the other side
[10:06] can't help but buy it for themselves
[10:08] then all of a sudden it's Off to the
[10:09] Races and it's a Bitcoin arms race to
[10:11] accumulate as much Bitcoin as fast as we
[10:13] can and Robin you and I know this is the
[10:14] reason we're in Bitcoin it's because
[10:16] these central banks have infinite
[10:17] balance sheets the money printer does
[10:19] not run dry it runs forever and so they
[10:21] have this infinite money printer to buy
[10:23] as much Bitcoin as they possibly can
[10:25] right thus making the denominator more
[10:27] worthless driving bitcoin's price up as
[10:29] result of that and then also using that
[10:31] to to stack more Bitcoin driving
[10:32] bitcoin's price up in its own right so
[10:35] it's going to be a very wild 2025 I
[10:37] don't think people are bracing
[10:39] themselves enough for that obviously
[10:41] there are several risks um you know
[10:43] macro risk factors this year but largely
[10:45] everything's looking good on the Bitcoin
[10:47] native front um you know Bitcoin
[10:49] generally Rises for three years and then
[10:50] Falls for one 2025 it's it's slated to
[10:52] rise as a result of that um the macro
[10:55] backdrop is very very supportive for
[10:57] that to happen um and you also have the
[10:58] prospect nation states the world's
[11:01] superpower the United States buying
[11:02] Bitcoin so um if you just put everything
[11:05] together it's it's going to be a really
[11:07] banner year for Bitcoin it's tough to
[11:08] see how Bitcoin ends the year anywhere
[11:09] lower than like
[11:11] $150,000 interesting this year is almost
[11:14] seems to be really hard to find
[11:16] something negative on bitcoin but you
[11:17] mentioned there are some risks to the
[11:19] adoption in 2025 what are those yeah for
[11:23] sure so obviously you have the prospect
[11:25] the the biggest risk factor is that like
[11:27] none of this happens like the R never
[11:29] comes to be Trump was just um you know
[11:32] lying in order to get votes from the
[11:34] Bitcoin cohort in order to get votes
[11:36] from the libertarian crowd talking about
[11:37] Bitcoin um like that never happens
[11:40] bricks falls apart nation states don't
[11:42] actually accumulate Bitcoin okay that's
[11:44] one risk um the other risk factor is
[11:47] like the economy just totally falls
[11:48] apart um for me that that isn't a huge
[11:52] risk factor because everybody in the
[11:54] audience knows that the FED has really
[11:56] quick to respond to times of Crisis and
[11:59] and the only thing that they ever
[12:00] respond with is the money printer so for
[12:02] example back in March of
[12:04] 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank happened
[12:06] basically when there was a run on the
[12:08] bank um and it had to sell uh some of
[12:11] its us treasuries it's impaired us
[12:12] treasuries it wasn't able to meet all of
[12:14] its obligations and it went bankrupt as
[12:16] a result um basically overnight what the
[12:19] FED did was it created an emergency
[12:20] facility to prevent that exact same
[12:22] problem from happening at other Banks it
[12:24] created this thing called btfp the bank
[12:26] term funding program basically it
[12:28] allowed all of the Banks who were
[12:29] holding impaired us treasuries rather
[12:32] than having to mark them to Market um at
[12:35] face value in order to meet their
[12:37] obligations from people who are trying
[12:38] to get their money back basically it let
[12:40] them go to the FED um and uh value them
[12:43] at par um and get a loan on that yeah
[12:45] let's say for example the FED hiked
[12:47] interest rates all the way up from 0.25%
[12:49] to five five and a half percent which is
[12:51] exactly what they did um as a result of
[12:53] that you have all of these losses due to
[12:56] duration or interest rate risk um on the
[12:59] price of these bonds obviously they're
[13:01] still being held um these Banks aren't
[13:03] selling them for cash but in the event
[13:05] that they do need to sell them for cash
[13:06] they're going to lose a lot of money um
[13:08] and so this is basically called
[13:10] unrealized losses or realized losses
[13:12] when you have to sell the security and
[13:13] so these Banks were sitting on these
[13:15] huge unrealized losses on us treasuries
[13:17] because of the fed's really aggressive
[13:18] raid hiking what did the FED do it made
[13:20] this facility where um it allowed Banks
[13:22] to take all these unrealized losses and
[13:25] then make them disappear overnight if
[13:26] they wanted them to um for I believe the
[13:29] period was 12 months or 18 months um and
[13:32] so the FED is really the point is the
[13:34] Fed is really quick to respond in the
[13:35] event that something goes wrong whether
[13:37] it's in the financial system right in
[13:39] the case of um 2008 whether it's in like
[13:42] interbank lending and US Treasury
[13:43] impairment like 2023 um and so I believe
[13:47] that whatever crisis comes around or is
[13:49] on the horizon that could come around in
[13:52] the next year the FED will do the same
[13:54] thing what they've always done they'll
[13:55] they'll come up with a very unique
[13:56] facility in order to back back stop the
[13:59] banks bail them out by whatever means
[14:00] possible um that gets passed on to the
[14:03] individuals but what what it means is
[14:05] that instead of having a prolonged
[14:07] recession like we had in 2008 um the
[14:09] recession if we do get one will be very
[14:11] short very truncated um so that's the
[14:14] second risk factor um and then the third
[14:16] risk factor is you know as a result of
[14:19] um yields just continuing to rise and
[14:21] rise and rise and there's no form of
[14:23] like yield curve control from the US
[14:25] government um you know either via uh
[14:28] lowering it issue in schedule um
[14:31] or yeah either via lowering its issue
[14:34] and schedule um or or actually creating
[14:38] a facility where the the uh Central Bank
[14:40] purchases bonds from the federal uh from
[14:42] the US government um and yields just
[14:45] continue to rip people just sell risk
[14:47] assets and buy us treasuries right it's
[14:49] really enticing um when you have you
[14:52] know let's say that the 10e yield is at
[14:55] like four 4.6% right now the 30-year
[14:57] yield is at like 4.9%
[14:59] it's really enticing for most people to
[15:02] say look I can just buy the 30-year us
[15:04] treasury bond get five and a half% or 5%
[15:07] every single year and it's getting to
[15:09] the point where it's so enticing that
[15:11] people are going to sell risk assets and
[15:14] that's basically what's happening right
[15:15] now um if you take a look at this chart
[15:18] that I just tweeted it's the S&P 500
[15:20] Equity risk premium basically it's the
[15:22] difference between the 10-year US
[15:24] Treasury yield and the forward earnings
[15:26] on the S&P 500 it's negative for the
[15:29] first time since 2002 which means that
[15:32] the yield the 10-year US Treasury yield
[15:34] is more attractive than the forward
[15:36] earnings um on the S&P 500 so what does
[15:40] that mean well it means that treasuries
[15:42] are more attractive than stocks and so
[15:44] people are going to sell stocks and go
[15:45] into treasuries and that's basically
[15:47] exactly um what is uh occurring right
[15:50] now and so basically if you continue to
[15:52] see yields Rising you'll see even more
[15:54] of this Dynamic that you could see up on
[15:56] screen playing out um the S&P 00 and and
[16:00] this this goes both ways right um
[16:01] because as yields continue rising and it
[16:03] becomes more attractive then guess what
[16:06] um that raises the cost of capital for
[16:09] these companies that are in the S&P 500
[16:11] and so it lowers their forward earnings
[16:12] and so this is kind of a a a feedback
[16:15] loop to the downside that makes equities
[16:16] less attractive us treasuries more
[16:18] attractive um until yields come down so
[16:21] that's the other big risk factor like
[16:22] this year is just such a great year for
[16:24] the US economy that yields just don't
[16:26] stop Rising um or or they continue
[16:29] rising in this really secular fashion
[16:31] like we've seen and people sell sell
[16:32] sell out of risk um that said I do think
[16:37] that this year is going to be um
[16:38] fantastic for Bitcoin I tend to air on
[16:40] the side of bearish rather than on the
[16:41] side of um these risk factors but we do
[16:43] need to think probabilistically we do
[16:45] need to factor all this stuff into our
[16:46] analysis when we think about where
[16:48] bitcoin's heading over the next year
[16:50] that's super interesting so basically
[16:51] the free risk factors is the first one
[16:53] is like SP not happening as a strategic
[16:56] Bitcoin Reserve not happening on any
[16:58] side which I feel like it's it's it's
[17:01] less of a risk uh it's a risk for this
[17:03] year but it's less of a risk overall
[17:05] because it's just a matter of time when
[17:07] they will do it uh and the second one is
[17:10] interesting for me also basically the
[17:12] economy collapsing which then as you
[17:14] said they will facilitate something
[17:17] which basically means they they starting
[17:19] up the money printer uh and which then
[17:21] hyper inflates or inflates the US dollar
[17:24] more which then benefits uh especially
[17:27] price US dollar Bitcoin and all feed
[17:29] prices anyways and the third one is
[17:32] interesting fiscally responsible uh
[17:35] government and and trying to uh um be
[17:40] that that the last one is hard for me to
[17:42] imagine happening especially with Trump
[17:44] in office uh but yeah keeping all that
[17:49] in mind uh I couldn't be more bullish
[17:52] for 105 but maybe I'm influenced by a
[17:55] daily Bitcoin podcast with a daily Bull
[17:57] on on on the show but it it seems to be
[18:01] a year where uh it's highly
[18:04] irresponsible to to sell your Bitcoin
[18:07] even if there's some downturn even if
[18:08] you are concerned about anything it's it
[18:10] seems to be like just just being that
[18:13] AET and see what's happening till the
[18:16] 31st of
[18:17] December oh absolutely and you know we
[18:19] haven't even talked about things like
[18:21] micro strategy now in the NASDAQ um or
[18:25] micro strategies preferred stock raise
[18:27] both of which are absolutely massive for
[18:29] Bitcoin nid also announced that they
[18:30] would be um exploring investing
[18:33] Insurance float into Bitcoin and so not
[18:36] to mention like these ETFs uh have been
[18:38] some of the most successful ETFs of all
[18:40] time these new Bitcoin ETFs and so the
[18:43] cohorts that are investing into Bitcoin
[18:45] it's not just you and me anymore it's
[18:46] not just these retail investors who are
[18:48] buying spot Bitcoin on Robin Hood or COI
[18:50] base or river um it's now these
[18:53] extremely sophisticated sectors of
[18:55] traditional Finance both in the equity
[18:57] Market passive flow
[18:59] the fixed income market and even things
[19:01] like Insurance flow right now which are
[19:02] very Niche but very huge pools of
[19:04] capital like8 and a half trillion dollar
[19:05] right so we're not that's that's
[19:08] discounting all of that this year is
[19:09] going to be great for Bitcoin when you
[19:11] factor all of that in really dis guise
[19:12] the limit is that maybe and and I know
[19:16] we have the discussion in every bll
[19:18] Market but with the marro strategy with
[19:20] the ETFs with potentially Nations is
[19:22] kind of that uh Market disruptor uh
[19:25] point where we get out of this fouryear
[19:27] cycle where we can I get out of this uh
[19:31] same thing happening all over with four
[19:33] years and we might have some different
[19:36] movements it certainly could be it could
[19:37] be because now not only is you know our
[19:40] Bitcoin buyers coming from far and wide
[19:42] but the amount of Bitcoin that they're
[19:43] buying is rising too and so then it it
[19:46] begs the question um you know are the
[19:48] fouryear cycles still something that
[19:51] will be followed I tend to think that
[19:54] they will be um I tend to think that you
[19:57] know volatility is decreasing that as
[19:59] Bitcoin um grows larger as an asset if
[20:01] you take a look at the percentage draw
[20:04] down from bitcoin's all-time high over
[20:06] the last five Cycles they have risen
[20:08] from like a 96% draw down to like a
[20:11] maximum of like 74% um during the the uh
[20:15] absolute you know bare bare Market
[20:17] bottom of this cycle so because we got
[20:19] to consider um at $93,000 Bitcoin is
[20:22] like a 1.94 trillion asset but at
[20:25] $100,000 Bitcoin is a an asset that's
[20:28] over $2.1 trillion in size um which
[20:32] means that is the seventh largest asset
[20:34] in the world right and generally
[20:36] speaking assets like that are not very
[20:38] volatile um we're talking things like
[20:41] Google stock Amazon stock um Saudi
[20:44] aramco uh these massive companies Apple
[20:48] um I think I mentioned Microsoft so as
[20:51] Bitcoin grows uh in its size as it
[20:54] monetizes to 2.1 trillion and then
[20:56] ultimately the size of gold and then the
[20:58] size of the entire US Treasury Market
[21:00] and then the size of the S&P 500 and
[21:02] then you know $100 trillion do and
[21:04] Beyond um it's just going to get less
[21:07] and less and less and less volatile um
[21:09] but I do think that these new cohorts
[21:11] coming in it's just it's all a part of
[21:13] the fouryear cycle um you know generally
[21:16] speaking this is this is just the way
[21:17] that Bitcoin moves it's kind of
[21:19] inexplicable but then again basically no
[21:22] model works with Bitcoin and my
[21:23] colleague Nick B explained this really
[21:25] really well over at the Bitcoin layer um
[21:27] one of the things he said is Satoshi
[21:29] totally destroyed economics with no
[21:32] demand response function every asset in
[21:34] the world has a demand response function
[21:35] so if there is massive amounts of demand
[21:37] you bring more Supply online for your
[21:39] asset you could do it with equities
[21:40] really easily you could issue more
[21:41] shares um then just like that um a
[21:44] company is several hundred billion
[21:46] dollars richer um with gold as gold's
[21:49] price Rises gold miners say hey took a
[21:51] look at that let's fire up more machines
[21:52] let's hire more people let's bring more
[21:54] gold out of the ground the supply
[21:55] schedule increases so every time the
[21:58] price of an ass it rises the supply
[21:59] schedule for that asset um that rises in
[22:02] price the supply schedule or the amount
[22:04] of issuance for that asset Rises too
[22:07] with Bitcoin you can't do that um you
[22:09] know if Bitcoin goes over 110,000 the
[22:12] miners can't you know um kind of work
[22:16] with each other and then say hey let's
[22:18] raise the supply schedule for Bitcoin
[22:19] you can't do that it's an absolutely
[22:21] fixed Supply and so basically every
[22:23] economic model of supply and demand is
[22:25] totally destroyed with Bitcoin because
[22:26] there's no demand response function
[22:28] whatso ever and so the four-year cycle
[22:31] may very well be broken who knows um I
[22:34] tend to think that as the US fiscal
[22:36] situation continues to get even more out
[22:38] of control people are going to start
[22:40] trading Bitcoin differently it's not
[22:41] just going to be an asset that people
[22:43] buy during great times that they treat
[22:45] like a very speculative asset they
[22:46] they're going to stop trading it like
[22:47] the NASDAQ and start trading it like the
[22:50] Apex risk-off asset that it is monetary
[22:53] debasement is the path of lease
[22:55] resistance in order to fund the US
[22:56] government um as a result you want to
[22:59] own the best hedge against monetary
[23:01] basement and time and again over the
[23:03] last decade that's been Bitcoin and so I
[23:05] believe that the big story over the next
[23:08] several years will be Bitcoin finally
[23:10] trading in the way that its monetary
[23:13] properties outlined in the white paper
[23:14] behind me allow it to trade which is
[23:16] like this Apex riskof asset that people
[23:18] buy in both good times and bad and that
[23:21] in and of itself could break the
[23:22] four-year cycle but that remains to be
[23:24] seen interesting how much attention are
[23:26] you paying to bitcoin price Model like I
[23:29] think stock the Flor and power the kind
[23:31] of the the more more famous ones yeah so
[23:34] I tend to think that these models can be
[23:36] helpful for understanding some of
[23:38] bitcoin's properties but not they they
[23:40] have very little predictive power um and
[23:43] Giovani might get on my case for this
[23:45] have had him on my show I think you
[23:47] you've probably had him on your show too
[23:48] um he might get on my case for this but
[23:50] these models have very little predictive
[23:52] power but one thing they are good at is
[23:54] helping you understand some of bitcoin's
[23:55] properties I'll take the stock the flow
[23:57] model for example um
[23:59] basically it it literally just models
[24:00] the existing stock of Bitcoin relative
[24:02] to the amount of Bitcoin that's coming
[24:04] online and then it tries to extrapolate
[24:05] a price target for that um it's helpful
[24:08] for learning that Bitcoin is an
[24:10] absolutely finite asset and therefore
[24:12] most models for it don't work and it can
[24:14] be helpful to consider both of those
[24:16] things when thinking of where bitcoin's
[24:18] price will be but as far as predictive
[24:20] power goes they're not very good right
[24:22] um the power law model um is great but
[24:25] again like these different models you
[24:28] know one standard deviation below or two
[24:29] standard deviations above like that's a
[24:31] huge range like that's a several
[24:33] hundred, range between where bitcoin's
[24:35] price could be and so while it is
[24:37] helpful for gauging where Bitcoin is
[24:40] going to go
[24:41] directionally doesn't have very much
[24:43] predictive power like here and now in
[24:44] the present and so while I I know about
[24:47] these models I don't really Factor them
[24:49] into my analysis at least what I'm doing
[24:51] it what I pay the most attention to is
[24:54] um interest rates and the money supply
[24:56] right um the US Treasury Market
[24:58] um influenced by the Federal Reserve is
[25:01] the deepest and most liquid um Market in
[25:04] the world it's the most widely used set
[25:06] of um Benchmark rates in the entire
[25:08] world the 10-year yield and the two-year
[25:10] yield in particular so as a result of
[25:12] that I just keep my eye on those things
[25:14] I keep my eye on those things and I take
[25:15] a look at the fiscal situation in the
[25:17] United States which can only be resolved
[25:19] by issuing more debt with where our
[25:21] interest expense is that debt needs to
[25:23] be issued at a very low rate and that's
[25:26] just the reality um which means that
[25:28] basically what we're what we need to do
[25:30] at the federal level is have the yields
[25:33] on our debt lower than the actual rate
[25:35] of monetary inflation to erode the value
[25:37] of that debt in real terms so basically
[25:39] negative real yields on our debt
[25:40] otherwise we go insolvent um we have
[25:44] currently something like um75 trillion
[25:47] dollars over the next um 50 years or 75
[25:50] years in unfunded obligations both
[25:52] Social Security and Medicaid um you know
[25:55] that we need to pay for somehow and
[25:58] we're not going to be able to do that
[26:00] with rates at a very high level and
[26:02] having to pay that out right to
[26:03] investors um our annual interest spense
[26:06] right now is like $1.6 trillion by the
[26:08] end of this year if rates go on the path
[26:10] that people think they will it'll be
[26:12] $1.9 trillion we can't pay that amount
[26:15] every year and then also pay for Social
[26:17] Security and Medicare without those two
[26:19] things drying up um politicians will
[26:21] never be elected again if those programs
[26:23] go away so really it's just a matter of
[26:25] the US government cannot stop funding
[26:28] itself it needs to fund itself and the
[26:31] math just is arranged in such a way that
[26:34] we need to fund ourselves at negative
[26:36] real interest rates and so the money
[26:37] printing is just going to continue
[26:39] forever right that's the reality um and
[26:42] so Bitcoin is like the only asset that
[26:44] you want to hold right um and that those
[26:47] are basically like the cornerstones of
[26:49] of my analysis um I tend to not throw
[26:52] around price predictions because of that
[26:53] I'm I'm a macro thinker um but Bitcoin
[26:57] is going to usurp you know my very
[27:00] Baseline assumption is that like in
[27:01] really short order in the next five
[27:03] years Bitcoin is likely going to usurp
[27:05] the market cap of gold which is like the
[27:08] current asset that the market uses as a
[27:10] monetary debasement hedge because it
[27:12] just doesn't serve that function very
[27:14] well um you know gold was basically flat
[27:17] for 20 years up until 2023 it's not a
[27:20] very good monetary debasement hedge uh
[27:23] compare that to something like Bitcoin
[27:24] which performs that function much better
[27:26] the market is coming around to realize
[27:27] that and so this informational Arbitrage
[27:30] basically that early Bitcoin adopters
[27:31] have had like this little secret that we
[27:34] all have had that Bitcoin is the best at
[27:36] serving this function of hedging against
[27:38] money printing um it's now becoming
[27:41] realized in the market and the best way
[27:43] to see that it's becoming realized is
[27:45] the percentage of Bitcoin at uh Bitcoin
[27:48] as a percentage of gold right just from
[27:50] a size perspective gold right now is
[27:52] over 20 trillion um or actually right
[27:55] around2 trillion in size I think $185
[27:57] trillion like that Bitcoin is now a
[28:01] little bit over 10% of that right and so
[28:04] as that approaches 100% this is just
[28:06] bitcoin's value proposition being
[28:08] fulfilled into reality right before our
[28:10] very eyes so my Baseline assumption for
[28:13] where Bitcoin is going is in the next
[28:14] five years is going to usurp Gold's
[28:15] market cap and it might be at a gold
[28:18] might be smaller than it is by the time
[28:20] that happens right um gold will be
[28:22] getting demonetized as this happens
[28:23] people will be selling gold and buying
[28:25] Bitcoin so when these two assets
[28:26] converge gold may very well be still be
[28:29] 8 trillion asset and Bitcoin is 8
[28:31] trillion but you got to realize that's
[28:32] $1 million a coin or close to $1 million
[28:34] a coin in the next five years um and so
[28:37] that's like that's my very Baseline
[28:39] assumption right bare case that could
[28:40] happen over the next seven and a half to
[28:42] 10 years bull case it could happen
[28:43] sooner than that but that's generally
[28:46] speaking like the the sole model that I
[28:48] rely on is what Bitcoin is what it's
[28:50] very good at and this this trend of
[28:52] demonetizing these other assets namely
[28:54] gold until ultimately it's larger than
[28:56] that that's really what drives my
[28:57] analysis
[28:59] that's interesting I I always thought of
[29:02] when Bitcoin will catch up gold that
[29:05] gold will be bigger in market cap
[29:07] because the US dollar will in that time
[29:10] frame uh devalue but I never factored in
[29:14] that bit Bitcoin in that process is also
[29:17] actively demonetizing gold at the same
[29:19] point where there's US Dollars flowing
[29:22] into gold but there's also US Dollars
[29:24] flowing out of gold and into Bitcoin
[29:26] directly uh that's that's interesting I
[29:30] I still feel like uh in if we say let's
[29:33] say in five years uh we we catch up the
[29:36] gold I still feel like and it's just
[29:39] inflation numbers but I still feel like
[29:41] Bitcoin and I still feel like the gold
[29:43] is higher market cap or do you feel like
[29:46] the the the suck from from Bitcoin is so
[29:49] great that uh the US dollar devaluation
[29:52] doesn't um account for that I think that
[29:56] this trend we've been on have gold I
[29:59] tend to think I I tend to air on your
[30:00] side right um because over the last
[30:04] several years again gold was basically
[30:07] flat for for you know 20 years until
[30:09] 2022 or 2023 or 2021 more accurately um
[30:13] and it's grown in market cap it was
[30:15] closer to12 trillion do now it is8 and a
[30:17] half trillion dollar right so I tend to
[30:19] think that that's probably the way
[30:20] things will go and so that means by the
[30:23] time Bitcoin demonetizes gold gold may
[30:25] be a 25 or even $ 30 trillion asset
[30:27] because even as Bitcoin comes under the
[30:29] scene as a superior monetary debasement
[30:31] hedge um gold will continue to be
[30:34] treated that way it will demonetize some
[30:35] of it so it will pull down that growth
[30:38] rate of gold somewhat um but
[30:40] nevertheless there will always be people
[30:41] who are investing in gold um there are
[30:43] always people who are going to never
[30:45] come around to bitcoin as an asset and
[30:47] so then as a result of that when Bitcoin
[30:49] URS gold it could very well be a 1.2
[30:52] million asset a 1.3 or $1.4 million
[30:55] asset if gold is 30 trillion
[30:58] by the time Bitcoin demonetizes it it
[31:00] usurps it not demonetizes but usurps it
[31:03] as the biggest asset in the world um
[31:06] then Bitcoin is one and a half million
[31:08] dollars per coin by the time that it
[31:10] catches up to gold right and that that
[31:12] process could very well happen given the
[31:14] accelerating Trend that we're on with
[31:15] Bitcoin adoption with these massive
[31:17] cohorts over the next five years how's
[31:20] that for a sound bite $ 1.5 million
[31:22] Bitcoin in the next five years I I
[31:24] already clipped it no I partnered up
[31:27] with coin vigilante this is the most
[31:30] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:33] saw created by anyone look at that

[33:34] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:37] that's really exciting I think that's
[33:38] good um but uh one thing I'm wondering
[33:42] how related is the Bitcoin price in
[33:44] general uh because I never look at those
[33:46] numbers uh to the monetary expansion of
[33:49] the US dollar is is is that like where
[33:52] Bitcoin is rising also the monary
[33:54] expansion or is there a lag in between
[33:56] did you see those numbers
[33:58] yeah yeah so I'll actually um if you'll
[34:01] allow me is it okay if I share my screen
[34:03] oh of course of course okay wonderful so
[34:05] this is and you can see this is my
[34:06] Bloomberg terminal um this is Bitcoin
[34:08] and Global M2 um and Bitcoin is lagging
[34:11] behind Global M2 in white by about 10
[34:14] weeks and so you can think of this as
[34:16] the global M2 money supply all of Fiat
[34:20] all of global Fiat all of the global M2
[34:22] stock denominated in US Dollars and so
[34:25] what we're seeing here is two things um
[34:27] we're seeing
[34:28] obviously monetary expansion but what
[34:30] we're seeing right now is not so much
[34:32] monetary contraction as it is um US
[34:35] dollar strength because remember all of
[34:37] these Global Fiat currencies in this
[34:39] chart are denominated in dollars um and
[34:42] so dollar strength in the same way you
[34:44] know as yields rise the dollar gets
[34:46] stronger in the same way that it's
[34:48] really bad for risk assets it's bad for
[34:50] Bitcoin um so this chart it's two things
[34:53] right it's the absolute stock of global
[34:55] M2 money but then it's also denominated
[34:57] into USD and so in US dollar terms is
[34:59] the global money stock rising or falling
[35:00] right now it's Contracting um but you've
[35:03] seen over the last several years
[35:04] particularly recently um Bitcoin has a
[35:08] really strong directional correlation to
[35:10] Global M2 and again this is both Global
[35:13] M2 expansion in contraction and also
[35:15] that conversion into USD so it's
[35:16] basically it's it's two things it's the
[35:17] global money stock and US dollar
[35:19] strength both of those two things impact
[35:21] Bitcoin to a very outsized degree you'll
[35:24] see here um when Bitcoin was a much
[35:26] smaller asset tracked Global M2
[35:29] directionally right you see that Bitcoin
[35:30] Rose massively above Global M2 and then
[35:33] it also dipped massively back down below
[35:35] Global M2 and this is when Bitcoin was
[35:37] still a sub2 trillion doll asset here
[35:40] it's a sub1 trillion doll asset in this
[35:42] Zone but you'll see that more recently
[35:44] once the um ETFs came close to being
[35:47] online and basically you know trafi came
[35:50] under the scene we get more rumors of a
[35:52] US strategic Bitcoin Reserve um
[35:54] basically the people who are in the
[35:56] Bitcoin Market are more sophistic at
[35:58] then you see that this correlation
[36:00] started coming much closer to one it's
[36:02] like almost a one toone correlation with
[36:04] the movement of the global M2 money
[36:05] stock with Bitcoin if you pull it to
[36:08] about September of last year um these
[36:11] two assets or you know Bitcoin and the
[36:13] global M2 money supply basically started
[36:15] moving in tandem with each other um now
[36:18] a lot of people will will look at this
[36:19] chart and you know they'll they'll have
[36:21] issue with it for several reasons but
[36:24] the reality is this is very interesting
[36:26] because the reason basically everyone in
[36:27] the west at least gets into Bitcoin is
[36:29] because it's a HED against money
[36:31] monetary de basement and what we're
[36:33] seeing here with this chart is a
[36:34] fulfillment of that value proposition in
[36:37] the numbers Bitcoin is tracking with the
[36:39] global money supply both to the upside
[36:41] but also to the downside um and with
[36:44] what I just laid out during our
[36:45] discussion why why the US dollar needs
[36:47] to continue being debased but also
[36:49] Global Fiat by extension needs to be
[36:51] debased even more even though we're in
[36:54] this period of US dollar strength it
[36:57] can't last
[36:58] um and so this white line is going to
[37:00] reverse right it might reverse this year
[37:02] it might reverse next year but the
[37:03] inevitable outcome is this is going to
[37:05] reverse um and Bitcoin alongside it will
[37:07] reverse too you can see in recent weeks
[37:09] Bitcoin has it's really held its own
[37:12] honestly um if I look at this chart here
[37:14] Bitcoin is you know really really trying
[37:16] to break above that 100K Mark with force
[37:19] it just hasn't done it s it hasn't done
[37:21] it very well because it's fighting
[37:23] excuse me it's fighting against the
[37:25] reality of of high yields a strong
[37:27] dollar and therefore Contracting Global
[37:29] M2 money stock denominated in USD so
[37:32] it's trying to fight this trend as best
[37:33] as it can but if strong yields if high
[37:36] yields continue climbing um and the US
[37:39] dollar as a result remains strong
[37:41] Bitcoin chances are Bitcoin will will
[37:43] lose this battle and be for a big
[37:45] correction um and so Bitcoin is very
[37:48] very heavily influenced by the global M2
[37:50] money supply especially as of recently
[37:52] um now again I'll be I'll hedge my
[37:55] language there um Bitcoin has its own
[37:59] native factors that cause it to rise you
[38:00] know this right we have the having cycle
[38:02] um we have things like nation state
[38:04] accumulation all of these things are
[38:06] great for Bitcoin in its own right but
[38:08] not great for other risk assets and so
[38:11] that could drive Bitcoin to Buck the
[38:13] trend of Contracting Global M2 just like
[38:16] we saw over here right um zero interest
[38:19] rate policy caused this absolutely
[38:20] scarce asset like Bitcoin to rise all
[38:22] the way from like $3,000 all the way up
[38:25] to you know um 64 and then $67,000 right
[38:29] a very similar thing could happen now
[38:31] where even though the global M2 money
[38:32] stock um is Contracting and it may
[38:34] continue Contracting as a result of
[38:36] again high yields spiking yields strong
[38:38] dollar um Bitcoin could dislocate if we
[38:42] get a strategic Bitcoin Reserve um uh or
[38:45] things like that or we get other nation
[38:46] state option um Bitcoin has its own
[38:49] native factors that influence its price
[38:51] to go up um that are separate from other
[38:54] risk assets um so this trend could very
[38:57] much continue it could very well
[38:58] continue this is a scary chart for some
[39:00] but um I would I would encourage people
[39:02] to look at this chart and be very happy
[39:05] because Bitcoin is fulfilling its
[39:06] promise as a global money supply
[39:08] debasement hedge and that you know that
[39:12] sucks when the global money supply is
[39:13] falling but we know that the
[39:14] inevitability is that Global money stock
[39:17] will rise and so that's fantastic for
[39:19] Bitcoin who has proven over the last
[39:21] year and some change that it tracks it
[39:24] to a tea that that that's amazing and
[39:27] and I think that's exactly what what
[39:29] Bitcoin like what a lot of people always
[39:32] say like oh Bitcoin should be hatching
[39:34] against inflation and then a lot of
[39:36] people say like oh inflation rised and
[39:38] Bitcoin didn't so like that's actually
[39:40] an argument against Bitcoin and here's
[39:42] kind of the proof that Bitcoin is a
[39:44] hatch against inflation because for me
[39:46] inflation is monetary expansion not the
[39:49] CPI uh so so that's kind of the the data
[39:53] proof that this actually is true and one
[39:56] other thing is really interesting about
[39:58] that um that I take a longer route
[40:01] around that maybe it makes lense later
[40:04] um when we have now uh Nostra and we
[40:08] have Twitter now trying to be more um
[40:11] more freedom of speech and now we have
[40:14] Mark Zuckerberg coming out and hey we're
[40:16] doing this fact check there no longer I
[40:18] think that's a reaction because there's
[40:21] an exit walf there's somewhere where
[40:23] people can go and I think a similar
[40:26] story is with Bitcoin and the the US
[40:30] dollar and Fe monetary systems uh where
[40:34] where when there is somewhere where
[40:36] people can go this something is kind of
[40:39] the scoreboard of how bad this fear
[40:41] system is going is doing and I feel like
[40:45] that's where we slowly come towards
[40:48] where um we have the Bitcoin US dollar
[40:51] price which is showing not only the
[40:53] adoption uh and the growth of Bitcoin
[40:55] but also the monetary expansion as you
[40:57] just showed uh really nicely and so when
[41:01] we have a lot of uh printing of money a
[41:04] lot of monetary expansion uh this
[41:07] Bitcoin thing is more and more uh this
[41:10] one indicator to show exactly this of
[41:13] course Bitcoin is also growing because
[41:14] more people adopted like people are
[41:16] orange building each other Michael saor
[41:19] is Orange Building I don't know Jeff
[41:20] pesos and they're coming together so
[41:22] like those things are also contributing
[41:25] to that price but a lot of things
[41:27] I feel like is the monetary expansion uh
[41:30] and that wide line as you showed us
[41:32] going up and in the right uh which is a
[41:35] a great thing I like to look at the
[41:37] Bitcoin US dollar price as as the
[41:39] scoreboard of how how bad fat is doing
[41:42] is that something that uh you agree with
[41:45] I do I do yeah because ultimately people
[41:48] want a way out right people want a way
[41:51] out you know especially my generation
[41:52] right especially Our Generation Um You
[41:54] know here in the United States the
[41:56] median home price in 2021 was something
[41:59] like
[42:00] $320 $330,000 now it's
[42:03] $400,000 um interest rates at the time
[42:06] were close to 2% 2 and a half percent
[42:08] and so your monthly payments on a
[42:10] 30-year mortgage with 10% down you know
[42:12] $30,000 down um would have been like
[42:15] $1,500 um you bring that and the total
[42:18] repayment amount would have been like
[42:19] $410 or
[42:21] $42,000 um so only 7 70,000 bucks more
[42:25] than what you paying than what the home
[42:26] price was um you fast forward to today
[42:30] with 7 a half% mortgage rates right on
[42:33] average across the US for a 30-year
[42:34] mortgage um and you pair that with the
[42:37] median home price now about 400 or
[42:40] $410,000 um so it's increased anywhere
[42:42] from $50 to $100,000 um the median home
[42:44] price and rates are now you know uh four
[42:48] times what they were or three times what
[42:50] they were um as a result now with 10%
[42:54] down 40,000 bucks down and withr
[42:57] interest rates you're paying close to
[43:00] you know $35 to $4,000 a month um for
[43:04] your home that you're trying to live in
[43:07] uh and your total repayment amount over
[43:10] 30 years is something like 850 grand for
[43:13] this $400,000 house and so now in the
[43:17] United States people my age um they feel
[43:20] discouraged extremely discouraged most
[43:22] of gen Z feels like they will never own
[43:25] a home and that's very bad
[43:27] um and that it's basically a reflection
[43:31] of this centrally planned money supply
[43:33] these centrally planned interest rates
[43:35] um failing people um failing young
[43:38] people right who feel like they will
[43:40] never catch up and never own a home and
[43:41] so what are they doing instead they're
[43:43] renting and they're buying Bitcoin um
[43:45] and that's just one area that's just one
[43:47] example of where people feel discouraged
[43:49] in the current economic environment and
[43:51] they're buying Bitcoin um as hopefully a
[43:54] way out of that um and so yeah no
[43:57] totally agree bitcoin's price is a
[43:59] reflection um of the downfall of global
[44:03] Fiat um it's a reflection of society RIT
[44:08] large rejecting the idea of centrally
[44:10] planned interest rates rejecting the
[44:12] idea of a money printer that will not
[44:14] shut off that always gets fired up
[44:15] whenever there's an issue um with our
[44:18] economy with our financial system um you
[44:21] know very much so bitcoin's price is a
[44:23] reflection of more people every single
[44:25] day opting out
[44:27] um of global Fiat in favor of absolute
[44:30] scarcity so I would totally agree with
[44:32] you um and again you know if we know
[44:33] that the inevitable path for the money
[44:35] supply is much higher just because of
[44:38] the fiscal realities that the United
[44:39] States is facing um then we know that
[44:42] Bitcoin is just going to follow suit um
[44:44] Bitcoin is inevitable because we can't
[44:46] stop printing money it's it's pretty
[44:47] straightforward um and if we know that
[44:50] um where we are from a de GDP standpoint
[44:53] um from a deficit standpoint we're on an
[44:55] accelerating growth trend
[44:57] um then we know that Bitcoin uh is also
[45:01] going to be following that accelerating
[45:02] growth Trend right um and so things like
[45:05] $250,000 Bitcoin um $500,000 Bitcoin $1
[45:09] million Bitcoin those things are much
[45:11] closer than they appear because of the
[45:13] realities of um this accelerating debt
[45:16] problem that the United States is facing
[45:19] so yeah Bitcoin while it is a proxy for
[45:21] the global money supply um its price is
[45:24] also like you said I like that analogy a
[45:26] scoreboard
[45:27] um for how bad the current system is and
[45:30] how it's failing interesting um when we
[45:33] spin that a little bit further um how do
[45:35] you imagine the end game of that we we
[45:38] print more and more money uh infl the
[45:42] currency is hyp inflating more and more
[45:44] um is that at some point where it gets
[45:47] so bad where the US dollar has to end
[45:49] and the F system has to end uh or do you
[45:52] see that always being a tool that
[45:55] governments and Central authorities have
[45:58] and we just make up new currencies along
[46:00] the way that a new generation has trust
[46:03] in and the Bitcoin is just an
[46:05] alternative currency do
[46:07] that yeah so I think um you know Fiat is
[46:10] great particularly um Fiat that's
[46:12] totally unbacked by anything it's great
[46:14] for central banks right it's fantastic
[46:16] it means that we have a um basically we
[46:19] can by centrally manipulating interest
[46:21] rates we can control largely the
[46:23] direction of the economy um we can hike
[46:26] hike rates into the Stratosphere and
[46:27] drive the economy into the dirt we can
[46:29] lower them below the rate of monetary
[46:31] debasement and we could create this huge
[46:33] economic boom um to the benefit of the
[46:35] asset holders of course right anybody
[46:37] who holds assets are the people who win
[46:40] so that's why younger Generations are
[46:41] also feeling discouraged because they
[46:42] don't hold any assets and so Bitcoin is
[46:44] the asset that they're deciding to hold
[46:46] um so Global central banks like Fiat is
[46:48] great for them um I don't think they
[46:50] will go willingly um they they will not
[46:52] drop this thing willingly um what they
[46:55] can do is strengthen their currency at
[46:58] the margin by stacking Bitcoin into a
[47:02] national Reserve at their treasury right
[47:05] that's what the US is exploring um the
[47:07] US is already the preeminent World
[47:09] Reserve currency uh and so people will
[47:13] move away from these other currencies
[47:15] long before they will move away from
[47:17] things like the US dollar um a country
[47:19] like El Salvador recognized this years
[47:21] ago they were very precient in
[47:22] recognizing this and na buk is already
[47:25] stacking Bitcoin into his
[47:27] with the recognition that hey chances
[47:28] are my fiat currency won't be used
[47:31] nationally for much longer um in order
[47:33] to bolster my balance street I'm going
[47:35] to stack SATs instead of that and allow
[47:38] my citizens to transact in it and
[47:39] therefore make my country more
[47:41] attractive to Capital allocators I think
[47:43] that's going to be the trend for other
[47:45] countries as well right other weaker
[47:47] Fiats um you know currencies and places
[47:50] like Africa um in Asia that are very
[47:53] rarely used um Bitcoin is going to be a
[47:56] way for central banks if they want to to
[47:58] make themselves attractive to Global
[48:00] Capital allocators as their fiat
[48:02] currency dies in The Vine um that said I
[48:05] think the US dollar um will not be going
[48:08] away um from the standpoint of it being
[48:11] um us Treasures being the collateral for
[48:13] basically all of global borrowing and
[48:15] lending I think it's going to stay here
[48:17] for a very very long time um hopefully
[48:20] the next Century right because I love my
[48:21] country I love the United States and
[48:23] it's just the position that we are in uh
[48:25] even though Fiat is is dying it's dying
[48:28] a slow and painful death um citizens of
[48:30] all these countries are slowly coming to
[48:32] realize the scheme that's going on
[48:34] behind the scenes of Perpetual monetary
[48:36] basement they're buying Bitcoin um I
[48:39] think just all of that Fiat death will
[48:41] bolster the US dollar um at the same
[48:44] time that it bolsters Bitcoin people are
[48:46] going to find very small very little
[48:48] utility in things like the Turkish ler
[48:50] or the Venezuelan Boulevard but they
[48:52] aren't buying Bitcoin instead they're
[48:55] buying US dollars instead right and so
[48:59] as Fiat dies that's fantastic for
[49:01] Bitcoin it just bolsters the United
[49:03] States position as the dominant
[49:05] superpower as the world Reserve currency
[49:07] the United States our power isn't you
[49:10] know like the US dollar the the
[49:12] colloquial like term around the globe is
[49:14] the US dollar is backed by nothing well
[49:16] no it's actually backed by the US
[49:18] military the US dollar isn't backed by
[49:19] the US military it's backed by global
[49:22] borrowing and lending it's it's backed
[49:24] by global Capital markets right um this
[49:27] several hundred trillion dollar machine
[49:29] of borrowing lending that's happening
[49:31] every single day every month every year
[49:33] um that's what's backing the US dollar
[49:35] and as other Fiat dies and people flip
[49:38] into the United States dollar it just
[49:39] bolsters our position even more um
[49:42] Bitcoin stands to do very well right
[49:44] alongside that so rather than Bitcoin
[49:46] and the US dollar being enemies Bitcoin
[49:48] is the enemy of Fiat the US dollar is
[49:50] the king of Fiat as other Fiat dies that
[49:53] strengthens the US Dollar's position but
[49:55] it also strengthens Bitcoin bit position
[49:57] and so over the next several decades um
[50:01] that's going to be the path that we
[50:02] follow a US dollar that's more widely
[50:04] used than ever before but also as a
[50:06] result of people uh as bit of bitcoin's
[50:09] price going up even more mass adoption
[50:11] Bitcoin becoming a 20 00 trillion asset
[50:14] um the power of the United States
[50:16] government um the Federal Reserve to set
[50:19] interest rates and therefore have this
[50:22] huge wand that it could um you know wave
[50:24] and influence a lot of the economy
[50:26] that's going to be taken away because
[50:28] the the total stock of US dollars that
[50:31] it influences via setting rates right um
[50:34] will be lower um and so even as the US
[50:38] dollar gets strengthened um because of
[50:40] this Dynamic of Fiat dying Bitcoin gets
[50:42] strengthen too but I believe some of
[50:43] that that power that the FED has in
[50:45] setting and determining the cost of
[50:47] capital will be taken away um so that's
[50:51] kind of it's a very it's a complicated
[50:54] thesis um but it's one that I'm sticking
[50:56] to and that I don't think the dollar is
[50:58] going away anytime soon but I'm also a
[51:00] massive massive Bitcoin bull um and I do
[51:03] not believe the utility of global Fiat
[51:06] non-dollar Global Fiat is uh is going to
[51:08] be around for very long I think as that
[51:11] goes away the US dollar gets
[51:13] strengthened Bitcoin gets strengthened
[51:15] right alongside it um and because the
[51:17] United States and I've said this several
[51:19] times now um because the United States
[51:21] has the um most free and open Capital
[51:24] markets and the best indiv idual
[51:27] Liberties um a strengthening US dollar
[51:30] is actually fantastic for Bitcoin right
[51:32] because it means that more of the and as
[51:34] we become you know the best country for
[51:36] Bitcoin companies to move to um you know
[51:38] it means that more miners are going to
[51:40] be here in the United States more
[51:42] Bitcoin companies are going to be here
[51:43] in the United States more people are
[51:44] going to move here because we're going
[51:46] to adopt the best policies for Bitcoin
[51:48] in the United States and so Bitcoin in
[51:50] the dollar rather than being enemies um
[51:52] when one does well it's actually very
[51:54] good for the other one um so it's a bit
[51:57] of it's kind of a a different thesis
[51:59] from what what a lot of people will will
[52:00] give but um that's what I believe is
[52:02] going to happen over the next several
[52:04] decades that's interesting um it it
[52:08] seems to be uh the the medium and
[52:11] longterm that story and maybe very long
[52:15] long term it it might change but uh I
[52:18] don't think I will I will see that in my
[52:21] lifetime at least that's what I think um
[52:24] you said something before also coming
[52:27] back to the Strategic Bitcoin reserve
[52:28] for a second um that you think that it
[52:32] there might be chances that he actually
[52:34] signs an executive order on day one that
[52:38] Bitcoin is actually there uh the Bitcoin
[52:41] Reserve those Bitcoins do they already
[52:43] have how high are those changes I hear
[52:46] that from more and more people and and
[52:49] maybe as you in American I'm I'm not H
[52:52] how big is Bitcoin in Trump's head
[52:55] actually like do do you do you know how
[52:57] important that that is for his core uh
[53:01] voting group and stuff like that because
[53:02] it feel like maybe we see too much of a
[53:06] Bitcoin classes that that the
[53:10] presidency yeah so I think um you know
[53:13] if you take a look at what Trump was
[53:15] promising in his first uh run for
[53:18] president basically everything he was
[53:19] promising he at least tried to bring it
[53:22] to fruition obviously you have the
[53:24] Congress right you have the Senate and
[53:25] the house of represent
[53:27] who sometimes throw wrench into Trump's
[53:29] plans right for example he wasn't able
[53:31] to begin construction of the border wall
[53:33] until like 2018 2019 um and he was only
[53:36] able to construct basically as much of
[53:38] it as he could before Joe Biden went
[53:39] into office it wasn't able to be
[53:40] completed but at the very least um he
[53:42] tried um to do what he promised to do um
[53:46] and so in the very same vein even though
[53:47] he might not accomplish it he's going to
[53:49] try and um unlike the border wall right
[53:52] there are many different ways to
[53:54] establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[53:56] that do not not rely on Congress and so
[53:59] I believe um that there's probably a 70%
[54:03] likelihood that in 2025 some form of
[54:05] strategic Bitcoin Reserve is created
[54:07] whether it's just reestablishing what we
[54:09] already have as the SBR um whether it's
[54:12] that plus using the exchange
[54:13] stabilization fund funds in order to buy
[54:16] Bitcoin um or whether it's passing the
[54:18] Bitcoin act in 2024 I believe that in
[54:20] some form of fashion there's about a 70%
[54:22] chance that this happens uh in 2025
[54:25] within his first year um if you look at
[54:27] a betting market like poly Market which
[54:28] was very good at predicting the outcome
[54:30] of the election it predicted it months
[54:31] in advance um despite what all of
[54:34] mainstream media was saying um you can
[54:36] remove all human opinion from it if you
[54:38] just take a look at what markets are
[54:39] saying because at the end of the day
[54:40] price is truth when you have a huge
[54:42] liquid Market that's saying this thing
[54:44] is higher likely to happening than
[54:46] another thing they tend to be very right
[54:48] and they tend to over time as the you
[54:51] know as whatever date is set for this
[54:53] event happening comes eventually the
[54:55] market can verges on what is actually
[54:57] going to happen so if we look at Poly
[54:58] market and just take away all human
[55:00] opinion um there's about a 30% chance
[55:02] that Trump creates a Bitcoin Reserve
[55:04] within the first 100 days um the odds of
[55:07] that dropped on November 6 they were
[55:08] about 60% but basically when this Market
[55:10] was created it was about 31% and it's
[55:13] oscillated between um about 45% and at
[55:17] the lowest like 22% right so there's
[55:19] about a 30% chance he does it within his
[55:20] first 100 days if you bring that out to
[55:23] all of 2025 there's about a 42% chance
[55:26] of it happen happening so I believe that
[55:28] the market is um really really uh it's
[55:32] not discounting the prospect of a
[55:34] strategic Bitcoin Reserve enough um
[55:37] markets are forward discounting
[55:38] mechanisms right so they price in events
[55:40] that they believe will happen into
[55:41] current day um but obviously markets
[55:43] operate on imperfect information they
[55:45] don't have all of the information out
[55:47] there um I think that if more people
[55:51] came to realize there are many paths to
[55:53] establishing a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[55:54] than the Bitcoin Act of 2020 for um
[55:57] which again relies on both parts of
[55:59] Congress to agree on this then it to
[56:01] reach Trump's then for it to reach
[56:03] Trump's desk um which is a lot of moving
[56:05] parts that need to go right in order for
[56:07] this to happen I think if more people
[56:09] understood there are other paths to this
[56:10] happening those odds would be much more
[56:12] in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve favor
[56:14] but because those odds are present and I
[56:18] know about them I'm factoring that into
[56:19] my probability um I think that Trump
[56:22] cares pretty deeply about this um he's
[56:24] stated it several times um and I think
[56:27] that uh if one method doesn't work he's
[56:29] going to try the other methods and so I
[56:30] think within 2025 there's probably a 70%
[56:32] chance of this thing happening
[56:34] interesting so so the Strategic Bitcoin
[56:37] Reserve would send bigger shock waves
[56:40] than we think because most people don't
[56:44] seem to and I get that in the comments
[56:46] also I I because every time it the topic
[56:49] comes up uh people like oh you're fool
[56:52] it will not happen like not never and
[56:55] stuff like that so like I I get that
[56:57] feeling even from
[56:58] bitcoiners uh most I think in my
[57:01] comments at least think that it will
[57:03] happen I I should I should do a poll on
[57:05] that uh I do every day a daily poll and
[57:08] a daily question so that could be an
[57:10] interesting one for this episode uh but
[57:12] yeah I also think that it will send
[57:15] bigger shock waves uh especially through
[57:18] the retail and uh and and the as I I
[57:22] call it the Nori land uh because I
[57:27] overestimated what uh the 100K price
[57:31] movement did for the the retail crowd I
[57:34] was very dissatisfied with the the small
[57:38] uh news coverage the small surges of
[57:41] that I felt the 100K was was a bigger
[57:44] event than it than it actually was like
[57:46] it was not celebrated a lot outside of
[57:48] Bitcoin Bitcoin of course the we
[57:50] celebrated it uh but how do you see that
[57:53] like did you see did you expect it more
[57:55] for the for it 100K
[57:58] Milestone I expected a much bigger move
[58:00] for the 100K Milestone because I thought
[58:02] of it as and he probably thought of it
[58:04] like this too like a huge psychological
[58:05] level for Bitcoin you hear Bitcoin is
[58:08] now a six figure asset it's $100,000 all
[58:11] of a sudden people go oh my goodness I
[58:12] have to get a piece of this but what you
[58:14] mostly saw was two things you saw that
[58:16] the celebration was really relegated to
[58:18] like the hardcore bitcoiners you and I
[58:20] the Bitcoin Twitter crowd the Michael
[58:21] Sailors of the world um and the other
[58:24] thing was that people looked at $100,000
[58:27] Bitcoin and they said well it's too
[58:28] expensive I can't buy one of those right
[58:30] because they just don't know that
[58:31] Bitcoin is divis divisible into 100
[58:33] million units you can get um right now
[58:35] 949 SATs for a dollar right um people
[58:39] just don't know that um if there was
[58:42] more education um around Bitcoin being
[58:46] divisible into 100 million units I think
[58:47] when 100K would have been much more
[58:49] wildly celebrated and hitting 100K would
[58:52] have just been like the spark that Lit
[58:54] the fire that drove Bitcoin to 150 like
[58:56] very quickly um but because of those two
[58:58] things because of unit bias and the fact
[59:00] that most mainstream media didn't really
[59:01] care it wasn't as hugely of a celebrated
[59:04] event as it should have been and it
[59:06] didn't do what it should have done for
[59:07] bitcoin's Price obviously it's battling
[59:08] these macro factors like I explained but
[59:11] it didn't do what we thought it would do
[59:12] for Bitcoin um I think Trump is a whole
[59:15] different story right Trump is the most
[59:16] outside of Jesus Christ Trump is the
[59:19] second most popular person on the planet
[59:21] right and so the prospect of Donald
[59:23] Trump saying all right the United States
[59:25] is now going to be buying Bitcoin
[59:27] actively or at the very least the United
[59:28] States is now establishing a strategic
[59:30] Bitcoin Reserve that's going to be much
[59:32] more widely publicized both on
[59:34] right-wing media and on leftwing media
[59:36] CNN is going to be calling this guy
[59:37] nutcase they're going to be calling him
[59:38] insane but nevertheless they're going to
[59:40] be talking about Bitcoin right and
[59:41] that's fantastic for for us um because
[59:44] you have basically everybody that wasn't
[59:46] in the no or didn't understand the
[59:47] importance of this hearing the news that
[59:49] Donald Trump leader of the Free World is
[59:51] going to be buying Bitcoin with the
[59:52] United States money all of a sudden
[59:54] people people's ears perk up and they
[59:56] tune in I think Donald Trump um passing
[59:59] a strategic Bitcoin Reserve into law in
[60:01] some form or fashion um is going to be
[60:03] much bigger news for Bitcoin than 100K
[60:05] and so all of that price Mania that we
[60:08] thought was going to come with 100K um
[60:10] it's going to come with the
[60:11] establishment of a strategic Bitcoin
[60:13] Reserve right so immediately jumping up
[60:15] to$ 150,000 $200 $200,000 in the
[60:17] prospect of the US doing this in buying
[60:20] Bitcoin because he's going to send
[60:22] retail Traders institutional investors
[60:25] um companies and Other Nation States
[60:28] into a frenzy to try to bid up as much
[60:29] Bitcoin as they can and so that kind of
[60:32] huge um bull market uh manic Loop of
[60:36] buying that sends Bitcoin all the way to
[60:38] 150 200 250 that we thought would come
[60:40] with 100K I believe that that's probably
[60:43] going to come once we establish a
[60:45] strategic Bitcoin Reserve which I view
[60:46] is a pretty high likelihood and just say
[60:48] yeah uh I love that um one more thing
[60:52] about Game Theory uh what happens if
[60:56] Trump doesn't do those things but the
[60:58] bricks go ahead and and actually do it
[61:00] and the bricks kind of see it as a
[61:01] chance um or do you see it more of like
[61:05] America has to move for the other bigger
[61:08] States like bricks to be incentivized
[61:11] and if America Now doesn't move that
[61:14] it's very unlikely that the bricks even
[61:16] touch it because they like oh like
[61:18] America also doesn't do it or maybe we
[61:20] should also not do it maybe America
[61:21] knows something that we
[61:23] don't I tend to think that um it's
[61:25] inevitable either way because if the
[61:27] bricks the the reason the bricks
[61:28] countries are considering Bitcoin is not
[61:30] because the US is considering Bitcoin
[61:32] it's because they want a hard currency
[61:34] to back their basket that's why right
[61:36] and so because that's the reason and
[61:38] gold isn't that currency Bitcoin is the
[61:40] only other option and so they're
[61:42] determined to move forward with this
[61:43] thing Bitcoin is their only viable
[61:45] option so if they do this before Trump
[61:48] then that's going to drive Trump to do
[61:49] it right um the inevitability is that
[61:51] brics does this one way or another um
[61:54] because they are determined to to do
[61:56] this and skirt around us sanctions um
[61:59] and the fact that the US dollar um has
[62:01] such a strangle hold on international
[62:03] trade for these foreign adversaries for
[62:04] the United States that's why they're
[62:06] determined to do this thing and Bitcoin
[62:07] is the only currency that can back it
[62:10] and so I view it as an inevitability I
[62:12] don't view it success as an
[62:13] inevitability but I think that them
[62:15] buying Bitcoin to back their basket is
[62:17] an inevitability and because of that
[62:20] that will drive Trump and probably drive
[62:22] a Congress that will be United in this
[62:24] to establish a IC Bitcoin Reserve
[62:27] because regardless of who you are left
[62:29] or right you don't want our foreign
[62:30] adversaries skirting around um our trade
[62:33] policy you don't want them avoiding our
[62:35] tariffs or our sanctions because that
[62:37] means less revenue for the United States
[62:39] and so if beating them means buying as
[62:42] much Bitcoin as we can to make it less
[62:43] affordable for them to back their basket
[62:45] of currencies then you'll have a United
[62:47] Congress that moves almost unanimously
[62:50] to pass the Bitcoin Act of 2024 into
[62:53] effect so we can buy that 1 million
[62:54] Bitcoin before these other Nations can
[62:56] so um whether it starts with Trump is
[63:00] irrelevant I think at the end of the day
[63:02] the US will be buying Bitcoin in Force
[63:04] One Way or Another because its hand will
[63:06] be forced by this other group of Nations
[63:09] that's going to be buying it regardless
[63:10] because it's the only hard currency that
[63:12] they can realistically
[63:14] use to back this uh basket of currencies
[63:18] I love the game theory it's just like a
[63:21] a snowball coming to you and you're like
[63:23] yeah like I have to jump on this
[63:26] I love that game theory aspect of it um
[63:29] before we come to to the end routine and
[63:31] the closeup of the podcast I have one
[63:33] more thing uh that I was interested in
[63:35] while I was listening to you um what
[63:38] role does AI play in all of this uh
[63:42] market dynamics and Bitcoin
[63:44] adoption yeah so I mean you know Jeff
[63:47] Booth has always said that Bitcoin um
[63:50] you know technology is deflationary
[63:51] right it should make everything less
[63:54] expensive but it doesn't because we have
[63:56] this accelerating inflationary force
[63:59] with money printing on the other end
[64:01] where you know we should be living
[64:03] better than King you you hear this a lot
[64:05] like it went viral on Twitter last week
[64:07] we're living better than all of the
[64:08] kings around the world were you know 500
[64:12] years ago a thousand years ago why
[64:14] because we have technological abundance
[64:15] I have this supercomputer right here
[64:17] we're talking to each other over this
[64:19] supercomputer right we should be living
[64:20] fantastic lives because technology is
[64:22] deflationary right it makes the cost of
[64:24] living less expensive it makes it so
[64:26] that you and I can drive gas powered
[64:28] cars to go get a cup of coffee that's
[64:30] made by somebody that we pay them for
[64:31] and then we drive back to our house that
[64:33] we own that should be the way things go
[64:35] but it hasn't been the way things go
[64:36] because of inflationary money right um
[64:39] Bitcoin changes that it's a better
[64:41] denominator for this increasingly
[64:44] technologically accelerating World
[64:46] Bitcoin is the better denominator for
[64:47] that AI is just the next evolution of
[64:50] that deflationary technology that brings
[64:52] about abundance to more people and it
[64:54] raises the level of prosperity for
[64:56] everyone um and so that's that's how AI
[64:58] fits into it it's simply another example
[65:01] of a technology that's raising abundance
[65:04] if we denominate ourselves in Bitcoin
[65:06] rather than than than Global Fiat um you
[65:09] know AI has been a tool that I've leaned
[65:11] on uh very heavily um over the last year
[65:14] and a half since chat PT came out
[65:16] especially chat PT 40 I use chat PT I
[65:18] used Claude I used Gro I use all of them
[65:20] um they're fantastic for my day-to-day
[65:22] workflow and everything that I do um so
[65:25] it's just like other Technologies it's
[65:27] this fantastic tool for humans to use
[65:29] but truly raising our living standards
[65:32] means denominating all of that
[65:34] technological advancement in Bitcoin
[65:36] instead of the US dollar and so that's
[65:37] how I think AI fits into all of this for
[65:41] for me AI is almost like uh almost more
[65:43] like Google the five years ago where I'm
[65:46] like if if that site is not on it's
[65:48] almost impossible to do anything and
[65:51] even more than that for me like uh jbd
[65:54] was I think like four months ago
[65:56] something like that two two hours uh
[65:58] down and I was like I will I will take a
[66:00] break
[66:01] now I was like yeah I will wait till
[66:04] it's back on it doesn't matter to work I
[66:07] don't want to change my workflow now for
[66:09] two hours but it's it's uh there's
[66:12] a it's it's interesting how fast
[66:15] technology can come in our lives and
[66:18] just be so important in our daily
[66:21] workflows that that's amazing to me um
[66:23] really cool we have one question to ask
[66:26] each and every one of my guests and the
[66:27] question is what can we learn from you
[66:29] besides
[66:31] Bitcoin yeah um the other thing you can
[66:33] learn from me besides Bitcoin is um
[66:37] living a living a god- centered life um
[66:40] I'm a Christian I'm a devout Christian I
[66:41] have in my whole life and one of the
[66:43] things I basically the biggest thing
[66:45] that I tweet about that isn't Bitcoin or
[66:46] macro or markets or the economy or
[66:49] geopolitics um is about Christianity so
[66:52] one thing you can learn from me um is
[66:54] trying to trying your best to figure out
[66:57] what God put you here for and then
[66:58] living a very Christ centered life
[67:00] that's that's the other thing you can
[67:01] learn from me ah amazing it's almost
[67:04] like I think at the end of like maybe
[67:07] five years of podcasting it will be
[67:09] religious I was not at all uh when I
[67:11] started the podcast uh one year and two
[67:14] months or something like that ago and
[67:16] I'm getting more and more religious all
[67:18] the guests I see I see some patterns
[67:20] with the guests really cool um we have
[67:23] end in the podcast where the previous
[67:25] guest is asking a question for the next
[67:26] guest without knowing who the next guest
[67:28] actually is and your question is
[67:31] interesting one uh if you were uh to
[67:34] land on Mars and you took the first
[67:37] steps uh on this new planet what would
[67:39] you
[67:40] say um I would uh say God Bless America
[67:45] and I would plant the American flag on
[67:46] Martian soil that's what I would do I I
[67:49] love that answer I could have almost uh
[67:52] guessed it really cool uh perfect and
[67:55] thank you so much Jo for being on uh
