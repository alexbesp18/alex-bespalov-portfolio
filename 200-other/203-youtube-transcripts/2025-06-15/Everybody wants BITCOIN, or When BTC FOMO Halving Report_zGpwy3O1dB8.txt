[00:00] the whole world getting a dose of fomo
[00:01] into Bitcoin that includes companies
[00:04] Nations States kind of all at once if
[00:06] you look back at history they've been
[00:08] manipulating the money and the people
[00:09] for so long so it's nice that we finally
[00:11] have a money that can't be manipulated
[00:13] there's not enough Bitcoin for every
[00:15] millionaire to have a full coin we're
[00:17] still using Rogue money Bitcoin is money
[00:19] and you cannot have enough money Bitcoin
[00:20] is going to be the base layer of our
[00:22] monetary World moving forward time is so
[00:24] important it's the only thing on this
[00:26] planet that's scarce everything else is
[00:28] not scarse except for Bitcoin
[00:31] you have an interesting podcast the
[00:32] Haring report uh and I just want to ask
[00:35] like why Haring like I feel like the
[00:37] Bitcoin having is a really interesting
[00:39] thing and the having itself is an
[00:41] extremely important thing uh to point
[00:43] out but is there a special story behind
[00:45] the
[00:46] name uh I actually sat on the name for
[00:50] quite a few weeks before deciding I
[00:52] really wanted to think of something that
[00:53] was going to resonate with with
[00:55] bitcoiners uh over the long term and
[00:58] sort of show that have a low time
[01:00] preference or I have a low time
[01:02] preference like with the podcast and
[01:04] just teaching people about the big
[01:06] picture obviously I'm a big believer of
[01:07] the having uh is going to move is going
[01:10] to uh dictate supply and demand so or or
[01:15] Supply anyways and you know as as demand
[01:17] stay setes or increases that's going to
[01:19] have a huge effect so and then I don't
[01:22] know the report came
[01:24] from I don't know I think I used to
[01:26] watch I used to watch the late night
[01:28] comedy the colar report report and then
[01:30] I kind of just put the having and like
[01:32] report together and I thought it sounded
[01:33] cool and uh yeah I've gotten some pretty
[01:36] good feedback on the name so
[01:38] far and Xavier you then came uh we from
[01:42] the beginning on with with Brad or did
[01:44] you came later a lot later actually Brad
[01:47] started this uh a couple years ago or a
[01:49] few years ago so he's been doing this
[01:51] for a while I joined um just in April
[01:54] now so oh uh maybe just like a month and
[01:57] a half I've been on the
[01:58] team really cool really cool um let's
[02:02] dive maybe directly into the Bitcoin
[02:04] Haring like what's what do you think is
[02:06] like the the significance of the Bitcoin
[02:08] Haring we just had it a few weeks ago
[02:11] like well it's a month ago uh but what's
[02:14] what do you think is like the the
[02:15] significance of it right now and what's
[02:18] what will it have in the in the future
[02:20] as a
[02:22] significance yeah I guess I'll start on
[02:24] that uh the significance of the having
[02:26] like like I said just kind of a couple
[02:28] moments ago like it did it just dictates
[02:30] uh how much issuance of new coins are
[02:32] are going to be in Supply and we can see
[02:34] that and so one of the great things
[02:36] about Bitcoin is that the the monetary
[02:38] policy is transparent so any of us can
[02:41] go look at the blockchain at any time
[02:43] and see what's going on with it and make
[02:45] predictions based on that so when you
[02:47] really when you really zoom out uh I
[02:49] think a lot of bitcoiners know this at
[02:51] this point and this is kind of what I
[02:52] try to teach new people coming into the
[02:54] space is that Bitcoin moves in Cycles so
[02:58] you know you usually we see six to 10
[03:00] months after the having we usually see
[03:02] new all-time price increase now recently
[03:05] we've seen new all-time high before the
[03:08] having which was unprecedented so that
[03:10] is that's pretty mindboggling to me so
[03:12] it's it tells me that we can
[03:15] see things differently this year uh or
[03:18] this this cycle and that could mean you
[03:21] know hyperbitcoinization uh we have you
[03:24] know a lot of talk about the spot ETFs
[03:26] and how much money's coming in and how
[03:28] much some of these the biggest invest
[03:30] firms in the world are investing into
[03:31] into Bitcoin like that wasn't happening
[03:34] in previous Bitcoin Epoch so the fact
[03:36] that we're going to this one uh we hit a
[03:38] new all-time high for the having totally
[03:42] unprecedented uh you know going to this
[03:44] 50 Pock of Bitcoin now and I think it
[03:46] just means that we could see some
[03:48] serious price movement uh I think to the
[03:50] upside so um I'm I'm pretty conservative
[03:53] with my Bitcoin price predictions but uh
[03:57] like I I I think it could be uh a little
[03:59] bit higher going up this this time
[04:00] around I think it was a little bit
[04:01] underwhelming last cycle so I think the
[04:04] having is a really good teaching point
[04:06] of people of uh the issuance of money
[04:08] and you know when when you compare to
[04:09] the old system of inflation uh you know
[04:12] you teach them you teach people about
[04:13] inflation understand the old system
[04:15] really helps to understand the new
[04:16] system Bitcoin so understand the old
[04:18] system and how inflation works and how
[04:20] Bitcoin uh acts to protect that and the
[04:22] having is a big part of that pre-coded
[04:24] into into the software so uh that's kind
[04:27] of my quick brain dump on that I'm not
[04:28] sure if you had anything anything to add
[04:30] on that X or or what your thought have
[04:33] have thoughts around that yeah no that
[04:35] that's a great way to that's a great
[04:37] Point um and and just to add on to it I
[04:41] I see the having so when the the block
[04:44] reward goes from uh six
[04:48] 6.125 I'm not sure actually I forget the
[04:51] number 6.25 to
[04:55] 3.125 perfect um so now I think of it as
[04:58] all these companies all these miners
[05:00] around the world are now competing for
[05:02] 3.125 Bitcoin every 10 minutes um on
[05:05] average every 10 minutes and that's the
[05:09] reason why the price I like the Fiat
[05:12] price for Bitcoin kind of goes up
[05:13] because all these companies are
[05:15] Computing for now 3.125 Bitcoin instead
[05:18] of six and it just kind of it keeps
[05:20] getting scarer and scarer and the the
[05:22] reward keeps getting smaller and smaller
[05:23] so um like in the next few
[05:29] is all these miners in the world
[05:31] competing for less than one Bitcoin so
[05:34] um the price per Bitcoin is basically
[05:38] the price that it cost all these
[05:41] companies to uh produce it so I see the
[05:45] having as a very bullish event and um
[05:49] just according to math the price of
[05:51] Bitcoin just kind to keep going up and
[05:53] up as the energy to produce it goes up
[05:55] and
[05:56] up which is interesting for me because
[05:59] whenever I see like the mining hash rate
[06:01] it kind of uncorrelated to the Bitcoin
[06:04] price which is for me fascinating to see
[06:06] it's a little bit surprising even like
[06:08] if if I just look at it the first
[06:09] principles uh it it should be more
[06:13] correlated uh but when you look at the
[06:15] hash rate it's kind of like it goes up
[06:17] even if if we are in a in a down Circle
[06:20] uh and it's like alltime High when the
[06:23] Bitcoin price is like 50% down of the
[06:24] alltime high uh so now it's it's near
[06:27] alltime High even the ash is also like
[06:29] really high on um do you see this this
[06:33] this correlation this is it surprising
[06:35] to you ask this this this correlation
[06:37] even though like the The Miner should be
[06:40] more correlated are we just now a in a
[06:43] massive Spike where the industry is now
[06:45] just cing in it honestly nothing
[06:48] surprises me in this market um but uh no
[06:52] like I I think it's just balancing
[06:54] itself out it's just trying to find out
[06:56] its its price um and but there's just so
[06:59] much has been going on over these past
[07:01] four years that the price is very it
[07:03] could be volatile um and it could be it
[07:06] could look like it's not corating with
[07:08] the um hash rate but I think it's just
[07:11] balancing itself out and it's trying to
[07:13] find its its spot right now um and yeah
[07:18] I guess that's my
[07:20] answer yeah if I can add there I mean I
[07:23] think is it Max Kaiser who says price
[07:25] follows hash rate or I think it's Max so
[07:29] I think like although we'll see we won't
[07:32] see the price steadily in in um increase
[07:36] like we do the hash rate eventually that
[07:39] will catch up to it as we see no hash
[07:41] rate's a good indication of how much
[07:42] computing power is backing the network
[07:44] so as that grows uh it just shows like
[07:47] how robust the network is and how many
[07:49] more computers are out there uh
[07:51] upholding the network and I think that's
[07:53] just a good indication that Bitcoin will
[07:55] do well just that price depends on so
[07:58] many you know very short term actors and
[08:00] people's emotions and you know selling
[08:02] and dumping so uh I think the hash
[08:05] rate's actually sometimes a better
[08:06] indication of how well Bitcoin is doing
[08:09] yeah definitely and it shows the the
[08:12] health of the the system uh when there's
[08:14] such a huge industry coming in and it's
[08:17] getting bigger and bigger every year
[08:19] it's it's it's fascinating to see um you
[08:21] mentioned Brad before that uh you see
[08:24] something different and you also like
[08:26] mentioned that the Bitcoin price reached
[08:28] almn high before the which was never
[08:30] seen seen before which is really
[08:32] fascinating for me also um what what do
[08:35] you imagine could be different and you
[08:37] also mentioned like hyperpronation what
[08:39] what what does it look like for you when
[08:41] when you talk about
[08:44] hyperpronation yeah good question I
[08:46] think hyperbitcoinization to me means uh
[08:49] fomo like the whole world be just
[08:51] getting a dose of fomo into Bitcoin and
[08:54] that includes companies Nations States
[08:57] kind of all at once coming into Bitcoin
[09:00] all all at the same time and that will
[09:03] obviously Drive price uh way higher up
[09:05] there's not enough Bitcoin for every
[09:07] millionaire to have a full coin you know
[09:09] and that's going to be um you know a a
[09:12] Mark that a lot of people are going to
[09:13] want to have but uh kind of keep
[09:16] slipping away further and further away
[09:18] for people to have that ability to have
[09:20] a full Bitcoin so yeah it just just a
[09:23] big competition of of Bitcoin and who's
[09:27] and I think that's going to include all
[09:28] actors you know individuals retail you
[09:32] know obviously we're talking Wall Street
[09:33] M major investment firms nation states
[09:36] you know we have El Salvador who you
[09:38] know uh is very transparent about their
[09:41] Bitcoin and how much they're stacking
[09:43] which is super cool to see I'm sure
[09:45] there's other nations doing it that
[09:46] aren't really uh being open or
[09:48] transparent about that yet so I think
[09:51] you know people naturally are going to
[09:53] move towards the hardest money and
[09:55] Bitcoin you know I think we all think
[09:57] here is you know the hardest money and
[09:59] asset that we've seen and naturally
[10:01] we're going to see people move into that
[10:03] into that so it's just it might just
[10:05] happen really really quickly and I think
[10:06] we kind of got um you know we we didn't
[10:10] go as far as we wanted to last cycle
[10:11] like I said earlier so this one I think
[10:13] could really see with that adoption now
[10:16] and the more regulatory Clarity we're
[10:19] going to see just everybody coming all
[10:21] in at once and you know it could be more
[10:23] price fluctuation too maybe it goes to
[10:25] 200 $300,000 for Bitcoin and then cracks
[10:28] back down to 150 and a lot of people get
[10:30] wrecked because they bought on the way
[10:31] up you know that happens every cycle at
[10:33] different prices so um yeah it could
[10:36] just be a big big wave of new users
[10:38] coming in and you know that's uh that's
[10:41] great for for all of us and you know the
[10:43] whole world actually
[10:45] so yeah it's it's fascinating for me
[10:48] also like because I feel like the last
[10:52] 2021 cycle was kind of tampen like it
[10:55] was was not what it could have been when
[10:57] we remember the 200 17 bll cycle it was
[11:01] just really crazy what's going on
[11:02] everyone was talking about Bitcoin
[11:04] everyone was having those icos it was
[11:07] like it it was uh a hu hu completely
[11:12] different time 191 felt not so crazy
[11:16] there was this whole thing with El and
[11:18] stuff like that there was then China
[11:20] afterwards the FDX and and Celsius and
[11:23] all all that fun stuff uh coming along
[11:26] but it was not so crazy I feel like
[11:29] um and I feel like this could all come
[11:32] now in the in the new cycle when it
[11:35] actually comes this form when actually
[11:37] institutional money is coming in and
[11:39] then the negative implications of the
[11:44] China thing happening the FDX thing
[11:46] happening is now p and now we can kind
[11:50] of look forward uh and you also
[11:52] mentioned that you see something
[11:54] different is it what do you expect this
[11:56] next EPO to be different is it h
[11:59] conization or do you also like see
[12:00] something else that uh like technical
[12:03] advancement or something that you that
[12:05] you
[12:06] [Music]
[12:08] see well I mean lightning is developing
[12:12] and a lot of people are in belief that
[12:14] that's how you're going to onboard the
[12:15] masses is through lightning so there's
[12:17] different camps within Bitcoin some
[12:18] people don't see it as any know as a way
[12:21] to you know transfer money or what ever
[12:24] ever want to use it in that manner so
[12:26] Bitcoin is very cool because it's
[12:28] different things to different people
[12:29] so but I do think you know that's when
[12:31] you ask me that question that's what
[12:32] kind of comes to mind real quick is just
[12:34] the lightning Network and the the
[12:36] ability to pay people uh with lightning
[12:39] speed and uh use Bitcoin like it was
[12:42] originally uh kind of used for in the
[12:44] beginning of the days when people could
[12:46] send you know a few Satoshi or I guess
[12:49] they would send full Bitcoins but uh for
[12:51] for a fraction of a penny and you know
[12:53] we might we might get into those days
[12:55] again and again we'll see how regulatory
[12:57] environment works out when it comes to
[12:58] that because I think you know policy
[13:01] makers are are very behind on this space
[13:04] so uh you know they're talking about you
[13:07] know to get to the point where we're
[13:08] talking about self- custody and having
[13:10] that having those rights you know
[13:12] lightning you know what is what is using
[13:14] Bitcoin look like in Canada uh with
[13:17] lightning Network and you know is is
[13:19] there going to be kyc is there going to
[13:21] be uh you know taxes on purchases under
[13:24] $200 like these are all things I would
[13:27] like to see in our in our country uh
[13:29] kind of laid out by our parties uh here
[13:31] that are they're going to be running for
[13:33] election next year so um yeah I don't
[13:37] know any more thoughts around that
[13:39] x no I'd like to see I'd like to see
[13:42] that too from our
[13:45] politicians
[13:46] um I think yeah there's there's a lot of
[13:49] development happening right now on on
[13:51] Layer Two um it's going to be
[13:53] interesting to see what Solutions there
[13:55] are out there because I think it's uh
[13:59] it it is a problem or or something that
[14:02] we that we should be looking into um and
[14:04] I think more developers are looking into
[14:06] that so um that is good and yeah I could
[14:10] just see the masses getting into Bitcoin
[14:13] and when they do get into Bitcoin they
[14:15] they will need to have these kind of
[14:17] solutions out there for them
[14:20] already yeah it's it's also fascinating
[14:22] to see I mean we we had the video from
[14:25] from Trump coming out I think yesterday
[14:27] or today EV on the on the time zone and
[14:31] and I was just like in Austria in the EU
[14:34] we have also elections right now like in
[14:36] the 9th of June there's the general EU
[14:39] election uh Austria I mean Austria's
[14:41] like doesn't nobody cares in the on the
[14:43] global scene about Austria but uh I'm
[14:46] there we also have elections and I
[14:48] follow the debates there and nobody's
[14:51] talking about anything close to crypto
[14:54] or Bitcoin or anything like that the
[14:56] closest thing I had that's uh one
[14:59] politician said it's bad that EU and the
[15:02] central bank has softened the currency
[15:05] so much and he wants to go back to the
[15:07] Shilling which was the currency in
[15:09] Austria before the euro which was a
[15:12] little bit harder but still still not
[15:14] really hard uh and I'm really like I'm
[15:19] kind of disappointed that it's not even
[15:21] a topic like not even they're not even
[15:23] talking about it uh if they have a bad
[15:25] opinion on it it's like okay then they
[15:27] have a bad opinion on on that they have
[15:29] to be educated but in America they at
[15:32] least they talk about it at least Trump
[15:35] has to kind of talk about it he like
[15:37] with the self custody right I mean it's
[15:40] maybe just marketing but even if it's
[15:43] just marketing it's a good sign because
[15:45] he has to talk about it right it's it's
[15:47] it's it's even if he does not mean
[15:49] anything what he says it's a good sign
[15:51] anyways for Bitcoin how does it how is
[15:53] it in in Canada actually how is how is
[15:55] the I mean true though I I hear nothing
[15:58] good of
[16:01] uh yeah so we actually just posted a
[16:03] clip there was um a liberal MP who spoke
[16:07] about the current political Bitcoin
[16:10] situation in Canada and it's mostly been
[16:13] uh political Grand standing uh but
[16:16] Pierre POV the leader of the
[16:17] conservative party here uh you might
[16:19] have seen him online like he's uh he's
[16:22] talked about Bitcoin he's gone to awarma
[16:25] spot here and paid for awarma in Bitcoin
[16:28] this was uh prior to him winning the uh
[16:32] like the to be the leader of the party
[16:34] this was before that and then now he's
[16:36] the leader of the party and there hasn't
[16:38] been a whole lot of um uh explanation of
[16:41] of how policy is going to differ from
[16:44] you know a Justin Trudeau government
[16:46] right now and how a conservative Pier PV
[16:48] government when they come in you know
[16:50] what what rules if any are going to
[16:51] change there hasn't really been anything
[16:53] proposed so um and then and then when
[16:57] Bitcoin so when Pier pev was talking
[17:01] about Bitcoin it was you know nearing
[17:03] around all-time highs and then it
[17:05] dropped you know whatever 50% and then
[17:07] Justin Shau had come out and you know I
[17:09] think he was appealing to some of the
[17:11] older voters when he came out and said
[17:13] uh you know that was your responsible
[17:15] for him to say you know Pier pz says you
[17:18] know put all your money in Bitcoin opt
[17:20] out of inflation and uh so he kind of
[17:23] took shots at Pierre over over endorsing
[17:26] Bitcoin uh when the when the price fell
[17:29] um but I did I did meet Justin Trudeau
[17:32] and nager on the lake in 2019 and I
[17:35] asked him if he knew about Bitcoin or
[17:37] crypto or I forget exactly what I asked
[17:39] him but uh he just started going off
[17:41] like he knew like what was going on I
[17:44] don't think he's come out and like
[17:45] talked about publicly yet because
[17:48] politics is a whole another beast and
[17:50] how you you know what you want to say
[17:52] and when you want to say it and I don't
[17:54] think him talking about crypto but like
[17:55] I asked him and he said his
[17:56] brother-in-law or something like that
[17:58] was in into crypto and he was you know
[18:00] he said a couple things really really
[18:02] quickly to me but he sounded like he's
[18:04] obviously well aware of what's going on
[18:06] uh just hasn't kind of hasn't come to
[18:08] the Forefront of our politics yet just
[18:11] like your country so uh but yeah it is
[18:13] nice to see you know uh that was
[18:16] probably that was probably the my
[18:18] favorite thing Donald Trump's everever
[18:19] said uh when he just said that about
[18:22] protecting self- custody my friends are
[18:25] some of my friends that support him are
[18:26] like you got to support Donald Trump now
[18:28] the reports got to come out and endorse
[18:30] Donald Trump and I'm like well let's not
[18:32] get carried away but I do I did like
[18:35] what he said there and I'm not sure what
[18:37] the Democrats stance are if they're
[18:38] going to be like trying to ban self-
[18:40] custody like if that's what they're
[18:41] trying to do I'm totally against that
[18:42] but we still got a long ways to go here
[18:45] in Canada in terms of how this is going
[18:47] to play out Canada usually follows what
[18:49] the states does so you know paying
[18:52] attention to the states you're probably
[18:53] going to get an idea of where Canada is
[18:55] going to go shortly after yeah and the
[18:57] interesting thing is like I feel like
[18:59] politicians will figure out really soon
[19:01] that bitcoiners at least the ones that
[19:04] I'm contact with and the feeling I get
[19:07] from the community are kind of single
[19:09] issue voters like if if if you are
[19:12] really against Bitcoin the rest can be
[19:14] really good but they probably don't they
[19:17] probably don't vote for you H and what
[19:20] Trump does it's he he doesn't even
[19:22] indorse Bitcoin he's just saying yes you
[19:25] can do with Bitcoin whatever you want I
[19:28] will not drive your way and you can of
[19:30] course like he does not even do a lot
[19:33] for Bitcoin he's not going out on a limb
[19:35] like Robert K F Kennedy Jr did so much
[19:38] more talking he he did he even went to
[19:41] the Bitcoin conference he actually did
[19:43] some work and and he exchange thoughts
[19:45] with with uh bitcoiners so he's way deep
[19:50] in uh and I forgot how then how he's
[19:53] called the I think he's Indian the one
[19:57] that also was running for president and
[19:59] now joined Trump how is he called VI
[20:03] yeah VI
[20:04] rasav and pro probably uh he was also
[20:09] like essential for Trump to get those
[20:13] things out because Riv viiv rosi really
[20:17] gets it I feel like he really gets
[20:19] Bitcoin to a to a more extent but yeah
[20:22] um I'm I'm it's funny to see I'm I'm I
[20:25] did not talk about politics at all on
[20:27] the channel like since
[20:29] one two months and now like the ele is
[20:31] coming it's comes more and more a topic
[20:33] and you see those in the Feats and it
[20:35] would be interesting to see this here
[20:36] what's what's your like X well it's
[20:38] interesting to see all the politicians
[20:41] that are starting to talk about Bitcoin
[20:43] and crypto like there is that Senator
[20:45] that posted that's been posting on X uh
[20:48] quite a bit lately and I'm just looking
[20:51] at one of her posts and she says not
[20:52] your keys not your coins I will fight to
[20:55] protect every American's right to self-
[20:56] custody and own their own own private
[20:59] Keys um so it's interesting to see all
[21:03] these politicians that are now starting
[21:04] to talk about it um and then you do have
[21:07] to think about it like are they are they
[21:10] playing are they just playing a game
[21:11] right now like because I wouldn't be
[21:13] surprised if these if some politicians
[21:15] are lying about it um or if they're just
[21:18] trying to buy voters and and stuff like
[21:21] that because those are all definitely
[21:22] tactics that they use um but like you
[21:27] were saying um like bitcoiners like if
[21:30] you're against Bitcoin I probably won't
[21:32] vote for you um so it's smart that these
[21:36] politicians are starting to talk about
[21:37] it um and like even Donald Trump a few
[21:41] years ago was on a interview and he was
[21:43] talking about how Bitcoin is a scam um
[21:46] and Bitcoin is weakening the dollar and
[21:49] then now couple years later he's
[21:50] promoting it so um I take it all with a
[21:53] grain assault um and I just try to see
[21:57] like what's really going on behind it
[21:59] but it's good that they're starting to
[22:01] talk about it and like we were saying
[22:03] earlier um it's I think it's super
[22:06] important now for there to be regulation
[22:08] or there to be clear um clear rules or
[22:12] or clear guidelines as to what uh
[22:15] Bitcoin and crypto is going to be for I
[22:18] guess the country um because it's like
[22:21] we're still using Rogue money at this
[22:24] moment what do you mean with with clear
[22:27] guidelines uh and and we're using roog
[22:29] money is like or or maybe differently
[22:32] ask um how much should politicians uh
[22:36] try to regulate this
[22:37] thing well I wouldn't want them to do
[22:41] damage to it um but like enough so that
[22:44] way companies know what their rights are
[22:46] companies know um how they can start
[22:49] their companies or how they can um like
[22:52] just rules that isn't going to push uh
[22:54] people away because some people might
[22:56] not want to go start a million two
[22:57] million plus dollar company Sur around
[23:01] Bitcoin because they don't know if uh
[23:03] the government's going to come knocking
[23:04] at their door for doing this wrong or
[23:06] that wrong um I'm not up to date with
[23:09] what's out there now but um I've seen a
[23:12] lot of people complain that the rules
[23:14] are outdated um like the SEC is outdated
[23:17] on everything that they've set
[23:19] surrounding Bitcoin so that's it's hard
[23:21] for I think companies to prosper right
[23:22] now with the rules that are in place so
[23:25] it's just it's good that again they're
[23:27] talking about it so that way we can
[23:29] start to get some clarity um and for
[23:32] businesses and people one other topic
[23:35] that I kind of thought of when When Brad
[23:37] was talking before uh we always had like
[23:41] this this shooting for six Bitcoin 10
[23:44] Bitcoin then it was like one
[23:46] Bitcoin the number is kind of coming
[23:49] down um when we have now an Outlook of
[23:52] like maybe like 10 20 years like a
[23:54] really long-term Outlook uh and someone
[23:57] is maybe Young maybe he's like 20 25 uh
[24:01] so he has like his his life ahead he
[24:03] probably has like 50 maybe 60 70 80
[24:06] years ahead um what do you think is like
[24:11] um the number to get in the the top one
[24:14] to five% of of the world uh in in having
[24:19] Bitcoin when you have like assuming
[24:21] Bitcoin is actually successful of course
[24:24] because otherwise doesn't make sense but
[24:26] if if Bitcoin is actually successful
[24:27] it's kind of the Bas layer of the
[24:29] financial world uh it's that uh sound
[24:32] money that we want it to be uh and uh
[24:35] everything else is is buil on top of it
[24:37] and everything else is kind of
[24:38] surrounded by Bitcoin um what do you
[24:41] think is like when someone is having
[24:43] like zero netw now and just starting out
[24:46] with working what should they shoot for
[24:48] us amount of
[24:50] Bitcoin or you want to start uh sure
[24:55] sure uh yeah I mean get as MIT get as
[24:58] much Bitcoin as you can is my is my
[25:01] advice I I guess uh that's a it's a
[25:04] tough question though but I think some
[25:05] people have kind of figured that out the
[25:07] numbers might be floating out there on
[25:08] the internet already of how much Bitcoin
[25:10] you need to have to be in the top
[25:12] whatever percentile of the new whatever
[25:15] new Bitcoin world order or whatever you
[25:17] want to call it but uh yeah that's a
[25:20] tough question uh I tell people you know
[25:23] obviously still like it's this it's it's
[25:25] the more you understand it the safer it
[25:27] feels and and you know depending on how
[25:29] aggressive you want to be I try to I try
[25:32] to push people who don't have any
[25:33] Bitcoin into you know dollar cost
[25:35] averaging create it as a savings account
[25:38] and you know slowly accumulate your
[25:40] position in Bitcoin in terms of you know
[25:43] the regular person getting in and top
[25:44] being in the top percentile you know
[25:47] unless you're like a you know a very
[25:49] wealthy person already with a lot of
[25:51] money to invest I think that's kind of
[25:52] out the door for common folk now it
[25:55] makes sense what Brad Brad was saying
[25:58] and I think people should just try to
[26:00] get as many as they can or as much as
[26:02] they can um if I were to give an answer
[26:06] right I would say get to one first and
[26:08] try to get to 10 or try to get to five
[26:10] to then to 10 and just try to again
[26:12] accumulate as much as you can um because
[26:16] again in like 20 years the having reward
[26:19] is going to be like 0.0 or sorry the
[26:22] block reward is going to be like 0.09 or
[26:26] like very very low um so that means that
[26:30] again the 0.01 Bitcoin is going to be
[26:33] worth just so much uh in the future just
[26:35] because of all this uh computing power
[26:38] going towards trying to find just 0.09
[26:42] so um I think if you have some you're
[26:45] going to be better off than maybe most
[26:47] people um and you're starting to learn
[26:50] about money you're starting to learn how
[26:51] to save you're starting to learn about
[26:52] inflation and all this stuff so either
[26:55] way if you have some Bitcoin you're
[26:57] you're going to get up there but
[26:59] um yeah I guess it would be very tough
[27:01] to be the top 1% to 5% um but I mean
[27:07] advice for people in their 20s or young
[27:09] 20s is just TR try to get to one Bitcoin
[27:13] um and then go further than that you
[27:15] don't want to just stop at
[27:17] one yeah you never have enough anyways
[27:20] so it's like you never want to stop it
[27:23] uh you cannot Bitcoin is money and you
[27:25] cannot have enough money of I I feel
[27:28] like
[27:28] uh and it's there's so many crazy
[27:31] calculations out there with like oh you
[27:33] need just 0.1 Bitcoin to be like top 5%
[27:37] uh if assuming everybody actually really
[27:40] uses Bitcoin as as their main store of
[27:43] value because it's a a lot of freaking
[27:45] money that comes into Bitcoin then uh
[27:49] but yeah like one Bitcoin is kind of the
[27:51] North Star like if if you if you have if
[27:55] you kind of can imagine getting to one
[27:57] bit coin do whatever it takes to get one
[28:00] Bitcoin like you you will benefit a lot
[28:02] from that and if you can get Beyond like
[28:05] it's it's it's amazing um what I also
[28:07] want to get into today is um you have a
[28:10] podcast with over 100 episodes uh and I
[28:14] experienced myself that I got educated
[28:17] in so many different ways from the
[28:19] podcast just from the guests because I'm
[28:21] making myself educated about the guest I
[28:23] try to have interesting questions and
[28:26] then I get really really interesting
[28:28] answers with that and this like for me
[28:30] every day but you also have like over
[28:31] 100 episodes is a lot of material over
[28:34] over the years um maybe get some like
[28:38] major learnings or key takeaways that
[28:41] you you you both had uh from from the
[28:44] podcast and yeah Brett do you want to
[28:47] start yeah definitely so yeah another
[28:50] good question it's uh definitely a
[28:52] learning process and you know I I have a
[28:55] very low time preference with it because
[28:57] I you know I think Bitcoin is going to
[28:58] be you know the the base layer you know
[29:01] of of our you know monetary World moving
[29:03] forward so I think just starting
[29:06] starting this as early as I could and to
[29:08] start documenting my journey is what I
[29:10] wanted to do and I think that some of
[29:13] the big takeaways is that like you said
[29:15] earlier people are very willing to help
[29:18] teach you and help spread the knowledge
[29:21] of Bitcoin so Bitcoins are very helpful
[29:23] and very good Educators usually so uh
[29:26] that was a really big takeaway for me
[29:28] and um also another takeaway is how
[29:31] powerful Twitter is Twitter SLX like
[29:34] it's such a powerful Tool uh for
[29:36] connecting with people it's like the
[29:38] main platform where people are going to
[29:40] speak you know when you're getting news
[29:41] from people you know you might as well
[29:43] go to x and get it from the horse's
[29:45] mouth rather than see the filtered
[29:47] headlines that you're going to see on
[29:49] whatever news out Outlet you're looking
[29:51] at again I just you know like to go
[29:53] right to X and uh see what people are
[29:55] saying themselves and then often that's
[29:56] where that's where news originates if
[29:58] you watch mainstream news nowadays it's
[30:00] you know they're of often referencing
[30:02] Twitter SLX so uh that was another big
[30:05] take away for me and um you know just
[30:09] learning you know how much is involved
[30:10] and like you know depending on how far
[30:12] you want to take it and you're if it's a
[30:14] podcast only if you're doing media
[30:16] beyond that uh you're going to live
[30:18] conferences there's really no ending in
[30:20] how much you can put into it and how
[30:23] deep down you can go into the Bitcoin
[30:26] rabbit hole and podcast rabbit hole with
[30:28] with equipment and learning all about
[30:30] how to you know construct a good
[30:32] engaging podcast or interview and just
[30:35] content in general um yeah that's a
[30:38] that's a quick brain dump but I'd be
[30:39] interested to hear what x has to say
[30:41] after uh have being on the team here for
[30:44] a couple
[30:45] months awesome no that was uh it was
[30:48] good what you just said I agree with you
[30:50] you know what x is such a good tool and
[30:52] people and you guys were both saying uh
[30:55] at some point but people that are into
[30:57] big coin are so willing to help other
[30:59] people um so people are willing to to
[31:02] come on and we've reached out to some
[31:05] bigger guests and and they're happy to
[31:08] come on share their stor so um X is
[31:12] definitely very powerful for that um and
[31:15] it's also so what I've noticed um and I
[31:19] just noticed like this from like
[31:21] interviewing as well um everybody comes
[31:24] from a different background so many
[31:27] people have so many different
[31:28] experiences and reasons why they got
[31:29] into Bitcoin so it's interesting to
[31:32] learn about people and and learn what
[31:34] brought them here and you can start to
[31:37] like let's say somebody comes in from
[31:39] the blue collar world and um they start
[31:43] to share their story you can then when
[31:45] you're talking maybe with your bluecar
[31:47] friends you can then share the story
[31:49] that you learned from that podcast to
[31:50] them so um again everybody just comes
[31:52] from a different background there's so
[31:54] much to learn from everybody um it's
[31:57] it's it's a great Community if you are
[31:59] listening to this podcast you might be
[32:01] wondering what is actually the setup
[32:03] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[32:06] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[32:08] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[32:10] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[32:12] right way let's focus on the first thing
[32:14] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[32:17] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[32:19] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[32:21] an exchange that has an own token or
[32:23] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[32:25] exchange I use 21 bit 21 Bitcoin is for
[32:29] me the best partner for that and now
[32:32] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[32:34] should be stored on a hardare wallet on
[32:36] a self custody solution where you
[32:39] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[32:42] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[32:45] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[32:48] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[32:50] fres and you are better than 95% of all
[32:55] Bitcoin holders if you have more than a
[32:57] th000 Euros in Bitcoin it's an
[32:59] absolutely must have one last thing
[33:01] before we get back to the video I'm
[33:03] really passionate about meeting other
[33:05] bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[33:07] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[33:10] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[33:13] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[33:16] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[33:19] visit Europe and visit this place in
[33:21] June for all europees it's a must go
[33:24] anyways you so close to the Bitcoin PR
[33:26] conference you basically have to come I
[33:28] will do interviews there and I would
[33:30] love to meet you all there use code
[33:33] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[33:36] discounts and use the links down in the
[33:39] description I I got that uh that
[33:41] question recently when I was on another
[33:43] podcast on the hearts speed podcast um
[33:47] and and she asked me what was your
[33:49] favorite podcast episode and I could not
[33:51] for the world to pick one so I mentioned
[33:54] a bunch of them can you can you pick one
[33:57] where was um maybe uh like really
[34:02] impactful for you or like change
[34:04] something in in the way you looked at
[34:06] Bitcoin or or something like
[34:10] that well I can say that nothing really
[34:12] pops out to me when I when you asked me
[34:14] that like you got me looking through my
[34:16] library now but my favorite ones are
[34:17] usually the ones where I don't expect or
[34:21] or the the guest is like unexpectedly
[34:23] like very eloquent so those those are my
[34:25] favorite ones um I'd have have to look
[34:28] through my library because I've had
[34:29] quite a few really good guests on um you
[34:33] know I'm looking at um Bitcoin Z here I
[34:36] don't know if you're familiar with with
[34:37] Bitcoin Z but I've had him him on a
[34:39] couple times and he's always he's always
[34:41] a lot of fun um you know uh old school
[34:45] Maxi uh but yeah it's it's really just
[34:48] uh when I get that kind of shock where
[34:51] I'm like wow this person's really
[34:52] eloquent and like I want to have this
[34:54] person back again those are always my
[34:56] favorite but in terms of like you know
[34:58] this one stood out to me were like way
[35:01] more memorable than any other one um you
[35:03] know besides like the really big names
[35:05] we've had on nothing really kind of pops
[35:07] out for me what about you Robin yeah
[35:11] it's really interesting because I have a
[35:13] lot of uh
[35:15] random people on that have almost no
[35:19] following uh like is as I work is like
[35:23] when I see something really interesting
[35:25] uh in my replies or on Twitter I'm like
[35:28] hey you want to come on my show uh I had
[35:31] someone who gives me really nice
[35:33] comments every time on YouTube and the
[35:36] comments are usually like really long
[35:38] and really in depth and and I enjoy
[35:41] watching the reading that comment from
[35:44] him a lot and I just today I was like
[35:47] hey uh I love your in inputs and I was
[35:51] like just from YouTube comments saying
[35:52] hey you want to come on the show I have
[35:54] no clue who he is I don't know who who I
[35:57] inviting here but the risk is zero
[36:00] because even if the episode is complete
[36:02] [ __ ] yeah then I don't post it uh so it
[36:05] it it it does not like it it does not
[36:08] matter and this is the the thing that I
[36:10] thought of and you just talked I had so
[36:13] many random PLS on and I'm almost always
[36:17] extremely positively surprised uh and
[36:20] sometimes there is something in them I'm
[36:22] like wow I I never thought of it that
[36:25] way and there's so many small instances
[36:28] where uh it's it's not for me it's not
[36:31] the the big switches where like oh all
[36:34] of the sudden you think in a different
[36:36] way it's the small nches that you get
[36:38] every day it's like when you talk with
[36:41] every day a bitcoiner that is actively
[36:43] speaking and wants to get out the the
[36:45] voice out there so they have something
[36:46] to speak because they have they're doing
[36:48] it uh in in in in a great capacity so
[36:53] they have something to say uh and it's
[36:56] like this small ning in different
[36:58] directions and the small perspectives
[37:00] that you get in Bitcoin uh it's it
[37:03] benefits you even Beyond Bitcoin so much
[37:06] uh and it's uh that that's my main
[37:09] takeaway always like the the there many
[37:12] small uh and quick learnings that you
[37:14] get from it uh and I kind of want to get
[37:17] like maybe a summary of of the podcast
[37:20] once with when I have like 200 or
[37:21] something like that um where I get over
[37:24] like some key learnings that I had maybe
[37:25] I make a special episode I don't know
[37:27] something I will will make with it maybe
[37:29] I make a medium article out of it but I
[37:33] don't know how to shorten that thing
[37:35] some so many hours of of of of content
[37:38] but that's that's kind of my my take X
[37:41] do you have
[37:42] like favorite guest or something that
[37:45] that stood out to you it first it'd be
[37:47] interesting like if you like once you
[37:50] get to 200 you did like a a little
[37:52] takeaway from every every video and you
[37:55] put that into one video like that' be
[37:56] cool
[37:58] um and you know what know similar uh to
[38:01] to you guys it's it's I think that's a
[38:03] tough question to to kind of pick one um
[38:06] just because they're you get surprised
[38:09] in almost all of them and um I think
[38:12] I've enjoyed every single one of them um
[38:15] so it'd be very tough for me to just
[38:18] pick one that that would be my favorite
[38:21] um Ju Just because again there there's
[38:23] so many good people out there that have
[38:25] such a good story to share um and I
[38:27] wouldn't want to pick one over another
[38:30] because again they're they're they're
[38:32] both great and they're all great so same
[38:35] thing I can't couldn't really pick one
[38:37] absolutely yeah and even uh I had some
[38:40] people on that I disagreed with them
[38:43] like 98% there was some some gold bu on
[38:48] uh and he had also some Bitcoin and he
[38:50] has some index for that he runs with
[38:53] with he how was it the name like yeah it
[38:56] was Bitcoin and gold and he called it
[38:59] bold the the Bold strategy and I was
[39:02] like that's a funny name let's let's
[39:03] let's let's talk with him and most of
[39:06] what he said I really disagreed with
[39:09] like but it was a really fun and
[39:11] engaging
[39:12] conversation uh and even if you don't
[39:15] take a lot with you and even if you
[39:17] disagree a lot it's still fun it's still
[39:20] you get something out of it and and it's
[39:22] it's uh it's it's it's amazing to to
[39:25] have those things which brings me to my
[39:26] next question and and you mentioned it
[39:28] kind of before I think Brad you
[39:30] mentioned it uh X is an amazing source
[39:34] of news uh and I see kind of the
[39:38] news World completely changing I mean
[39:41] the internet is not that long here it's
[39:44] funny to to to live through two such
[39:46] great revolutions with the internet
[39:48] Revolution and then Bitcoin we can now
[39:50] talk if Bitcoin is part of the internet
[39:52] Revolution or it's its own thing but
[39:54] it's like two really big uh Revolution
[39:57] on it own I feel like how how do you see
[40:01] um media and and the social media and
[40:05] the traditional media on media in
[40:07] general uh evolving uh especially when
[40:11] we see now more and more people like
[40:12] just as I'm also doing I go on a for
[40:15] news I go on YouTube for long form
[40:17] content I rarely go on TV and even if I
[40:20] want to see something from TV I search
[40:22] it on YouTube
[40:24] honestly yeah yeah no it's a really good
[40:27] point I think you know the the media
[40:29] landscape has evolved rapidly and it's
[40:32] going to continue to evolve rapidly and
[40:35] I think it's better all around I think
[40:37] it's better because it's more democratic
[40:40] so anybody now can have their own you
[40:42] know news page everybody can have their
[40:44] own ex um and you know put out their own
[40:48] put out their own news based on their
[40:50] own rather than you know traditionally
[40:52] it was you know you watch TV and you get
[40:53] news from the few certain channels well
[40:56] you know now a lot of people people our
[40:58] age are or just younger people in
[41:00] general are you know going to online uh
[41:04] going to social media which I think is
[41:06] sometimes bad too like some people just
[41:08] read headlines they see on Instagram and
[41:10] then they formulate a whole opinion
[41:12] based on that so there's good and bad
[41:14] it's like it's it's like a technology
[41:17] like the internet is a tool could be
[41:19] used for good or bad same thing with
[41:21] Bitcoin right you could use it for good
[41:22] or bad but it's a it's a tool that can
[41:24] greatly enhance the the current
[41:26] landscape and many ways uh so the
[41:29] internet I think does that but it's also
[41:32] uh for lack of better words broken a lot
[41:33] of people's brains I think because if
[41:35] they weren't they weren't aware of
[41:37] what's going on prior to the internet
[41:39] then the internet came along and just
[41:40] overloaded everybody with information
[41:43] and then you get into these
[41:45] bubbles of uh recurring information over
[41:48] and over again so uh one thing I try to
[41:50] do personally is you know I'm looking at
[41:53] what both sides are saying uh and I try
[41:55] to look at try to understand why why
[41:57] they feel that way and like what stats
[41:59] support that you know both uh you know
[42:02] and you're never never going to agree
[42:03] with with everybody on everything but uh
[42:06] yeah definitely a very evolving
[42:07] landscape and then the big um thing with
[42:10] with uh media now is AI so AI is just
[42:14] like there's going to be so much more
[42:15] content being pumped out over the coming
[42:18] years as AI as normal people get used to
[42:21] using things like chat
[42:23] GPT uh and just you can create content
[42:25] so easily now uh you could have
[42:27] oneperson show doing what a whole team
[42:30] used to do for a website a News website
[42:33] now any anybody can just kind of you
[42:34] know copy and paste articles uh tweak it
[42:37] a little bit or whatever use Ai and you
[42:40] know you can have your own news platform
[42:42] no problem I just don't think there's
[42:43] going to be much money in it uh now
[42:45] there's a big thing going on people like
[42:47] to you know X has talked about this on
[42:50] podcast with a couple people the whole
[42:52] you know censorship of news in Canada
[42:54] Robin I'm not sure if you've seen that
[42:55] but that's kind of a big thing right now
[42:58] is Canada is going to battle against
[43:00] some of these big Tech Giants and you
[43:03] know some some people say that you know
[43:05] Justin Trudeau just wants to you know
[43:07] silence silence all media that doesn't
[43:09] agree with them uh but they're they're
[43:11] going to battle with uh like Google and
[43:14] meta over compensation of journalistic
[43:16] work so they want these big tech company
[43:19] giants that are reposting their news to
[43:21] their platforms to have to pay uh I
[43:24] don't know if it goes to the federal
[43:25] government or whatever and it's like a
[43:26] re like trying to reimburse journalists
[43:28] or something like that but there's a
[43:29] battle and it's not just with Canada I
[43:31] think there's a lot of other countries
[43:32] that are uh kind of in this conundrum
[43:35] where journalists aren't getting
[43:36] compensated anymore so I think Australia
[43:39] has some sort of deal and every country
[43:41] is approaching it differently right so I
[43:43] think we're going to see a lot of
[43:44] countries going to to battle with some
[43:46] of these Tech giants that are uh just
[43:49] just taking all the profits now really
[43:50] um you know journalism is looked at as a
[43:53] as a big part of free speech in
[43:55] democracies and a in a uh a vital point
[43:58] of of democracy and you know as a check
[44:00] and balance for our system so I think
[44:03] protecting journalists but I'm just not
[44:04] sure sure how much compensations there's
[44:07] going to actually be for journalists
[44:09] when everybody can do it so uh that's
[44:11] the craziest thing about the future is
[44:13] that nobody can predict it uh it's
[44:15] always going to be something like no one
[44:16] really some people predicted Bitcoin you
[44:18] know if you're in the crypto
[44:19] cryptography you know forums or whatever
[44:22] but uh not everybody can can foresee
[44:24] that uh happening and I think you know
[44:27] like you said the internet's still young
[44:28] so we're going to see how things develop
[44:31] still for for years to come and how
[44:34] journalism is going to play out but uh
[44:36] internet's definitely changing it AI is
[44:38] huge and changing it uh I just hope you
[44:41] know we can find some sort of uh you
[44:44] know peaceful ground I would say yeah
[44:47] the the thing with journalism is really
[44:49] interesting because I had kind of an
[44:53] Awakening like I think two weeks ago it
[44:55] was uh some someone left me the comment
[44:58] uh hey Robin you're one of the best
[45:00] upcoming
[45:01] journalists and I'm like I I never
[45:04] looked at myself as a
[45:06] journalist I was like oh yeah I like to
[45:09] speak with people and I like to ask them
[45:11] questions and we talking but then I
[45:14] looked at it as a first principal
[45:16] thinking like yes that's kind of what
[45:19] Journal is also doing like they
[45:20] interviewing people they they are trying
[45:22] to to research about stuff they're
[45:24] trying to get to the bottom of of of
[45:26] things so like
[45:27] that that's kind of amazing that
[45:29] everyone can be a journalist uh and it
[45:33] it's it will be interesting to see how
[45:35] this all involves and there's a lot of
[45:37] open questions uh but I'm I think this
[45:42] is extremely extremely good because if
[45:45] everyone can be a journalist and
[45:47] everyone can have their own show but not
[45:50] everyone will watch everyone which means
[45:53] the ones that have the best capabilities
[45:56] of finding the truth and and presenting
[46:00] the truth will ultimately uh rise to the
[46:04] top uh so it it's like the free market
[46:08] competition and and I'm also like I'm a
[46:11] really big believer in the free market
[46:12] that's why I'm also like saying I don't
[46:14] have anything against the other
[46:17] cryptocurrencies uh I personally don't
[46:19] hold any I just focus on bitcoin only uh
[46:22] but I'm not the one that would like if
[46:25] if someone would say hey let's vote
[46:27] against that altcoins all are forbidden
[46:30] I would against I would vote against
[46:32] that because I'm a free market
[46:34] maximalist like let's say like that yeah
[46:37] uh so I would never forbid anyone to
[46:40] participate uh and in in the same sense
[46:43] I see with journalism like if if just
[46:45] everyone can do it the best ones uh will
[46:48] will will be there and I myself still
[46:51] does not see myself as a
[46:53] journalist I cannot associate myself
[46:55] with the word for some reason uh even
[46:57] though I heard it now uh two times
[46:59] already in the comments it's it's it's
[47:00] fascinating for me to see uh but yeah AI
[47:04] is also an interesting one uh because uh
[47:07] Riverside probably you also have seen it
[47:10] uh they rolled a new feature out where
[47:12] you can uh reproduce your own voice uh
[47:15] which is scary good like really scary
[47:19] good I tried it like I like put a small
[47:23] text that I could Al also say like the
[47:26] text just personalized for me and I just
[47:29] like pressed generate like after five
[47:31] minutes it was done and I pressed record
[47:33] I pressed play and I was like oh [ __ ]
[47:36] that sounds like me oh so they're
[47:39] replicating I didn't see this feature
[47:41] yet so this is new to me so you can type
[47:43] in what you want it to say in your own
[47:46] voice yeah that is oh that is scary that
[47:50] is scary it's text to speech it's in the
[47:53] Riverside app uh and you just you tap it
[47:56] Tex in it's limited now to like 2,000
[47:59] characters or something like that so
[48:01] it's like maximum two minutes uh but I
[48:05] already like tried it uh and it's
[48:08] fascinating good like I make a lot of
[48:10] ass in between and AI does it too they
[48:15] copied my a and put it in places where I
[48:17] would also a and I was I was so blown
[48:21] away how good the quality is and it's a
[48:23] a beta feature it's not fully there like
[48:27] and I was like it's it's so fresh now
[48:30] imagine 10 years from now they will be
[48:33] able to see like someone could just take
[48:37] all my podcast episodes at 10 years I
[48:39] probably have like thousands if I keep
[48:41] up the pace it just put it in a machine
[48:44] and then they can just replicate me uh
[48:46] and and then there's an AI clone which
[48:49] gives me a lot of thinking uh where we
[48:52] are going with AI I have no clue like
[48:54] this whole AI topic honestly it's it's
[48:58] over my head I hear a lot of opinions
[49:01] like opinions on oh people will only
[49:03] listen to people but what if those
[49:06] people digitally look like people speak
[49:09] with like people and you just don't know
[49:12] the
[49:14] difference yeah yeah it's a good point
[49:17] like you said I I don't know where this
[49:18] is going to go either because it's very
[49:20] quickly making humans Obsolete and they
[49:23] could certainly you know throw I'm sure
[49:25] in a couple years throw up a virtual
[49:26] version of me and X up there you know
[49:28] asking questions that we already put it
[49:30] in there and you know people wouldn't
[49:32] know the difference either way so uh
[49:35] it's it's very strange but yeah I don't
[49:38] know you better watch o x so I can go on
[49:40] there and make you say whatever I want
[49:41] now so I know AI is AI is interesting um
[49:46] and deep fakes are going to be something
[49:48] that that that comes up a lot especially
[49:51] with like elections and just with with
[49:53] stuff that's going on in the world
[49:55] people can make this person this vice
[49:58] president this President say something
[50:00] and it could look so real um and then
[50:03] there's some people that will watch it
[50:04] and and then just turn off their screen
[50:06] and say I can't believe you just said
[50:08] that without maybe looking a little bit
[50:10] further and realizing that it's it's a
[50:12] deep fake it's a it's an AI generated
[50:14] video that's that made that person say
[50:17] that so AI is
[50:20] definitely it's interesting to see where
[50:22] it goes um AI is amazing it's it's
[50:25] amazing what it can do um
[50:27] but it's definitely a bit like scary too
[50:30] to see how how much like it could
[50:33] definitely do some bad uh to people as
[50:36] well um and X is good for that x uh
[50:42] great social media the why it's good for
[50:44] it is because the community notes so if
[50:47] something is fake if some information
[50:49] that somebody put out isn't true um
[50:52] anybody that's part of the community
[50:53] note team can go in and you can apply
[50:56] for the community note team pretty
[50:57] easily and and just get in on it so
[50:59] there's a lot of just regular people
[51:00] around the world that are participating
[51:02] in it um but anything that isn't that's
[51:06] that's controversial or just isn't true
[51:09] can get community noted and then this
[51:11] will let everybody know that this isn't
[51:13] true and this is why here's the link so
[51:16] it's nice to see that things can get
[51:17] debunked now um people can't just put
[51:20] out false information and have the
[51:22] masses believe them um so it could get
[51:24] community noted so that's one way I
[51:26] think that it could be regulated or or
[51:29] just kind of uh won't be as dangerous
[51:33] there um and X's you guys were talking
[51:36] about it like just social media um X is
[51:41] such a good social media for uh
[51:43] information
[51:44] journalism um in X spaces I remember
[51:48] when like after October 7th there was
[51:50] the attack um in Israel I we I joined an
[51:54] xpace and there's like a 100,000 people
[51:58] on there listening to news on what's
[52:00] going on back and forth they had prime
[52:03] they had people that are in politics or
[52:06] um just in the ranks from different
[52:07] countries in the Middle East Come on
[52:10] talk about the situation and it's just
[52:12] such a good platform to really get that
[52:15] real information um and like briad was
[52:18] saying best to get it right from the
[52:20] source rather than see that information
[52:23] regurgitated on on different platforms
[52:25] usually X is the first platform to
[52:28] really have that news and then other
[52:29] platforms like Instagram YouTube Tik Tok
[52:33] even most of these platforms just copy
[52:36] information that they see on
[52:37] X yeah and I was also um thinking about
[52:41] is we have not a blue check mark with um
[52:45] uh Twitter and I think it's just a
[52:48] matter of time till we get another form
[52:51] of verification uh where you're like oh
[52:55] this account is is verified a real human
[52:59] being like this this will be a real
[53:02] thing where you when you want to be
[53:05] verified as a human being you have to uh
[53:07] have some verification uh thing because
[53:10] phone numbers you can buy phone numbers
[53:13] you I don't know what uh it's it's so
[53:16] long ago that I did the X verification
[53:19] process I don't even know what they
[53:20] asking that I think it's just a phone
[53:22] number uh and then you have to pay for
[53:24] it and that's it I don't know if there's
[53:26] I don't think I put any idea into that
[53:30] or did I I I I have no clue honestly
[53:32] maybe I'm wrong sorry to interrupt you
[53:34] rob in there but I just uh reverified my
[53:36] personal account on Twitter and uh they
[53:39] actually do like a a selfie like you
[53:41] have to put your face there's like AI
[53:43] technology so you're putting your full
[53:45] identity in there so I think I think
[53:47] that's the goal right now is to verify
[53:50] human beings uh I think that's kind of
[53:53] part of it right now
[53:55] although there's three different levels
[53:57] of pre like premium I think there's
[53:59] three different levels you can sign up
[54:00] for there's like I don't know basic
[54:03] premium Premium Plus or premium X or
[54:05] something like that but um you know back
[54:08] in the day when Twitter was still free I
[54:10] think that people were talking a lot
[54:12] about just like you know make it like a
[54:14] $1 like a a small fee uh and now it's
[54:18] like 10 like I I feel like the price is
[54:20] maybe a little bit high like we kind of
[54:21] went from like you know being it free to
[54:24] like you know now now they want like
[54:26] cund bucks a year to operate it I think
[54:29] like I thought I was hoping it was going
[54:31] to be like a dollar or two which I would
[54:32] have been all four but uh now like now
[54:35] I'm paying for my personal one I got the
[54:37] hav report one so I got two verified
[54:39] accounts going and uh but yeah no that's
[54:43] kind of a brain dump
[54:46] there yeah I think the the cheapest one
[54:50] I just wanted to look it up I think the
[54:51] cheapest one is like three yeah three
[54:53] three EUR a month uh which is kind of an
[54:57] okay range uh but I don't think you get
[55:00] the blue I think with the smallest
[55:02] account you don't get the blue verified
[55:04] Mark you have to have like the premium
[55:05] which is like 10 bucks whatever Canadian
[55:07] dollars a month it is um it is cheaper
[55:11] actually I'm pretty sure if you bought
[55:13] the membership on a computer rather than
[55:16] the phone as well really yeah yeah
[55:19] that's a real Twitter e musk is is is
[55:23] kind of taking a step against Apple and
[55:26] and Google I think also as well uh if if
[55:29] you buy a subscription just on the web
[55:32] you are paying less price because uh
[55:35] eask is just giving the um percentage
[55:39] that Google and apple is charging to the
[55:43] consumer so the is making the same uh
[55:47] profits with it and they're like okay if
[55:49] you buy your subscription on on the web
[55:52] you're getting it a little cheaper when
[55:54] you buy it on on on Apple like with a
[55:56] subscription you have to pay the premium
[55:59] that Apple takes from us uh so that's
[56:02] and really cool move I feel like for for
[56:06] for from uh elen because he just can
[56:09] give the cost to the consumer and if the
[56:12] consumer is intelligent and don't want
[56:14] to have the addal cost they can just
[56:15] like log in in the the web browser and
[56:18] just do it with the credit card without
[56:20] the Apple ecosystem which is I love that
[56:22] move
[56:23] honestly yeah I I like that too I like
[56:26] that move too um but while it's on my
[56:29] mind X mentioned Twitter spaces earlier
[56:31] and if I could just take a quick moment
[56:32] to plug it we're now doing uh Twitter
[56:35] spaces every Tuesday morning now at 10
[56:38] a.m. eastern time so uh we just had a
[56:41] really good one last Tuesday where we
[56:43] did a uh Canadian Bitcoin conference
[56:45] recap where we had you know authors and
[56:48] and actually the organizer came onto the
[56:50] Twitter spaces uh so there are a lot of
[56:53] things like Elon mus did do a lot of
[56:55] things really quickly with Twitter some
[56:57] things I like some things I don't uh but
[56:59] I think like there's a lot of good for
[57:01] sure coming with it and a lot of you
[57:03] know learning curve for him as as the
[57:05] operator of it now or the owner uh
[57:08] realizing why Twitter did some things
[57:10] that they that they that they do right
[57:12] but definitely some big changes there I
[57:14] mean I don't I don't disagree there was
[57:16] way too many bots on there so like you
[57:18] know paying something to verify you're
[57:20] human that you're human uh you know I
[57:23] think that gets rid of like a such a
[57:25] large port of the Bots right there they
[57:27] say so you know I'm all for that and
[57:29] then you know Twitter spaces and live
[57:31] and you know monetization um you know
[57:33] and that's something that X really
[57:34] brings value to having report he he's
[57:36] really in tune with what's uh you know
[57:38] the latest features on on X um so uh
[57:42] Twitter spaces is is something we're
[57:43] going to continue to do is like a you
[57:45] know almost like a side new show that we
[57:48] do uh that we're calling you know all
[57:49] paths lead to bitcoin uh every every
[57:52] Tuesday morning Robin so if you're ever
[57:53] around I don't know what time it is in
[57:55] your area uh on 10: a.m. on Eastern time
[57:58] but uh we'll be doing that every every
[58:00] Tuesday if you ever want to come chat
[58:02] with us
[58:02] live 100% I will be there I will I'll
[58:05] just look up what sorry X go ahead I
[58:09] will look at the time for me yeah I was
[58:11] just goingon to say a is such a good
[58:12] platform now for creators too because
[58:14] they've introduced the monetization part
[58:16] as well um it takes a little bit of time
[58:19] to get to those 5 million impressions
[58:22] but you could really work on it and and
[58:24] like focus on it for a few months and
[58:27] it's doable it's doable for everyone um
[58:31] your replies count as impressions as
[58:33] well so if you're just going on to the
[58:36] biggest accounts and they have posts
[58:38] that go viral all the time you just go
[58:40] look at the post and add your two cents
[58:42] something interesting and um you could
[58:45] get posts that like I remember my first
[58:48] post that kind of went viral was it was
[58:51] around the time there was a um the
[58:54] submarine crashed
[58:56] um back in like June last year and I
[58:59] just posted like a dumb meme about it
[59:01] and I'm pretty sure it got like 300,000
[59:04] views and just a bunch of likes comments
[59:07] this and that and I realized how easy it
[59:10] really is to get impressions or to to
[59:13] get that kind of Engagement it's tough
[59:15] on your own posts of course um because
[59:17] we're we're still small accounts or
[59:19] smaller compared to accounts that have
[59:20] hundreds of thousands or millions of
[59:23] followers um but to go and comment on
[59:26] those accounts um on a post that's doing
[59:29] well and something relevant people look
[59:31] at the comments like me usually if I see
[59:32] a good post I'll go look at the comments
[59:34] see what other people are saying so um
[59:37] it's it's definitely possible for
[59:39] everybody to get monetized on X as well
[59:42] and it just gives more reason for people
[59:44] to come and be on X rather than all
[59:47] these other
[59:49] platforms 100% uh I mean it's I don't
[59:53] know what what you're getting but it's
[59:55] not not life changing money no no but
[59:59] it's nice to get uh money for [ __ ]
[60:02] posting on X I love it for sure for sure
[60:05] I I got a the payment this Friday and
[60:07] just put it all into Bitcoin just more
[60:10] sads with it so thanks for the free SS
[60:14] yeah in 10 years it will be one hell of
[60:17] salary I I guarantee you that well there
[60:20] are some accounts that literally make
[60:22] like 6,000 bucks every two weeks 10,000
[60:24] bucks every two weeks 5,000 2,000 and
[60:27] that's just insane like if you really do
[60:29] put the work in you could definitely
[60:31] replace your your job your Fiat job that
[60:35] you have if posting on X is something
[60:38] that you want to do if creating content
[60:40] for people is what you want to
[60:42] do it's possible now I mean it's kind of
[60:47] like a social media podcast but I want
[60:50] one thing I wanted to say to to X no the
[60:54] they kind of teased always that they
[60:56] want to do more with video and they
[60:58] really want to get dive into the the
[61:00] video segment of it I'm kind of
[61:02] disappointed that they to this St don't
[61:04] have
[61:05] an a really designated video tab or
[61:09] something like that uh because to this
[61:13] day long form videos or even like shorts
[61:17] long shorts go better and better but the
[61:19] long from videos are just not doing good
[61:21] like I see like I posted on on YouTube
[61:23] and I post it on X the same podcast and
[61:26] I have on YouTube like 4,000 subscribers
[61:28] something like that on on X I have like
[61:30] 12,000 or something like that uh so
[61:33] technically on a it should be doing so
[61:36] much better but videos just are so much
[61:39] better performing on on on YouTube the
[61:41] whole ecosystem is is way better
[61:44] designed for uh the long for videos and
[61:47] of course people if this if they go to
[61:50] Twitter they don't go there to watch a
[61:53] long from video when you go on YouTube
[61:56] they more prepared to go on a long from
[61:57] videoos so that's like something that
[61:59] also has to change but I feel like they
[62:00] can do a lot with designing uh the
[62:03] platform and I would I would love to to
[62:05] see
[62:06] that me too I think it'll I hope it
[62:10] comes soon but you're so right um I when
[62:13] I want to go watch long form videos I
[62:15] just open up YouTube and YouTube's
[62:17] algorithm is pretty good too like I feel
[62:19] like the videos that come on my main
[62:21] page are just interesting videos that I
[62:23] want to watch so it'd be cool if you're
[62:26] right if x had that tab for videos and
[62:28] you just go on and X I think does have a
[62:31] good algorithm so if they can work on an
[62:34] algorithm for long form videos because I
[62:36] prefer watching videos on X than I do on
[62:38] YouTube um and I used to probably like
[62:42] YouTube like but anyways I have my own
[62:45] problems with YouTube but with X um X
[62:48] you can leave the video and just have it
[62:51] playing in the background like you don't
[62:52] even have to watch the full thing and
[62:53] you can go do other things on your phone
[62:55] so I do prefer to use x right now um for
[62:59] videos but unfortunately you're right
[63:01] it's just not consistent there's not a
[63:04] consistent place to go and find good
[63:06] quality content long form videos right
[63:08] now hopefully that changes yeah YouTube
[63:11] can you can do the same thing but you
[63:13] have to pay for the the premium thing
[63:15] right right but yeah um let's come back
[63:19] before we come to the end end routine of
[63:21] the podcast uh to bitcoin uh one last
[63:25] question I have because it's for me a
[63:28] fascinating thing that people come into
[63:31] Bitcoin and change more than just the
[63:33] money like they come into Bitcoin and
[63:35] they learn something um is this
[63:37] something um that you learn through the
[63:41] process of adopting Bitcoin through the
[63:43] process of being in the Bitcoin
[63:44] Community besides any monetary thing and
[63:47] besides yes some money or economics is
[63:49] there anything that you you learn from
[63:52] Bitcoin or Bitcoin economy uh from the
[63:54] Bitcoin community
[63:57] sorry the question is is there anything
[63:59] else besides you know monetary benefits
[64:01] through
[64:02] Bitcoin for me it's fascinating when
[64:05] people um adopt Bitcoin and people get
[64:09] into the Bitcoin ecosystem all of the
[64:11] sudden they are like getting into Health
[64:13] they're getting into uh nutrition
[64:16] they're getting into other stuff as well
[64:19] I mean it's not everyone some people
[64:21] just like we're really good in a
[64:22] economics in this low time reference
[64:24] mind before and just then adopted
[64:26] Bitcoin but I feel like most of them are
[64:30] really shifting something even with
[64:33] Bitcoin I ask myself why is this like
[64:35] maybe it's just because we're really
[64:36] early and it's like in this early kind
[64:39] of uh motivated engaged group of people
[64:44] maybe it's just because low time FR
[64:46] money actually does something with your
[64:48] brain I'm not sure about that but uh
[64:50] yeah just like if there's something that
[64:52] you kind of learn from Bitcoin or from
[64:54] the bitco community
[64:57] X do you want to go first on this
[64:59] question sure I can um so I guess you
[65:05] really well for me I I learned and I I
[65:09] might have had some of this before I'm
[65:10] not sure but um you really learn I think
[65:12] to value your
[65:14] time
[65:16] um because and then goes back to the
[65:19] saying time is money um but like I guess
[65:21] it makes sense uh because your time is
[65:24] so important it's the only thing on this
[65:26] planet that's scarse everything else is
[65:28] not scarse like except for Bitcoin but
[65:32] um you can make more money you
[65:34] can go buy this have more drinks
[65:37] whatever but you'll never get that time
[65:39] back so um I think just realizing how
[65:43] important it is to value your time um is
[65:46] something I learned from Bitcoin and
[65:47] then um also how to create value instead
[65:51] of how to create money um so if you can
[65:53] create value for people the money will
[65:56] come like if you can solve a problem for
[65:57] somebody somebody um you can you can
[66:01] sell it basically so I've learned how to
[66:04] I guess create value instead of creating
[66:06] money and the US government or the
[66:10] Canadian government are the experts that
[66:11] creating money so I'll leave that to
[66:15] them yeah so I think that's well said I
[66:18] like the part you said about you know
[66:20] the value there and you know for me it's
[66:23] I think the the learning about Bitcoin
[66:25] was you know mostly you know jumping
[66:30] into computer science a little bit more
[66:32] and learning how the nodes work and
[66:34] connect and you know topology of of all
[66:37] these computers connecting to one
[66:38] another so I guess outside of like
[66:41] monetary benefits and and that kind of
[66:43] thing it probably just learning about um
[66:46] just kind of what's going on in the
[66:47] background Bitcoin under the hood
[66:49] basically so definitely more like
[66:52] technology uh which is kind of a I think
[66:54] an obvious answer but uh you know you
[66:57] said that you see people you know
[66:58] getting into fitness and you know being
[66:59] healthier and all these other things uh
[67:02] and I think that does happen for a lot
[67:03] of people uh for me I was kind of
[67:06] already in the know of you know how
[67:07] corrupt things were when I found Bitcoin
[67:09] it was like a an anti-dot to the
[67:11] corruption so that's kind of how I fell
[67:12] in love with it but um I think a lot of
[67:15] people are getting their time back like
[67:17] uh Xavier just emphasized like people
[67:19] are realizing that time is the most
[67:21] valuable asset and when Bitcoin gives
[67:23] you that time back oh now I can go to
[67:25] the gym and be healthy because I'm not
[67:26] you know have my Fiat job for you know
[67:28] an hour there work for eight hours maybe
[67:31] I'm there for nine hours 10 hours drive
[67:32] an hour home or however far people are
[67:34] traveling for work you know it just
[67:37] enables you to have that freedom back
[67:38] once you uh realize Bitcoin and and you
[67:41] get to a stage where you're like oh wow
[67:43] I'm not you know I've held through a
[67:44] couple having now so when you look on
[67:46] the long-term Outlook I think it gives
[67:48] people more freedom that gives people
[67:50] that Financial Freedom to pursue those
[67:52] passions that they're you know maybe not
[67:54] necessarily going to bring monetary uh
[67:57] value right away but you're working on
[67:58] things that uh how you can create value
[68:00] in the long run like I said like you
[68:02] know the creating values where the money
[68:04] is going to come naturally so uh I think
[68:06] just getting that time back to be able
[68:08] to focus on those other things Bitcoin
[68:10] certainly helps with
[68:11] that yeah I hope that answers your
[68:13] question yeah I I love it and uh the
[68:17] time thing is I think the biggest one
[68:19] and it's like as you said the value
[68:21] thing is also a really really big one
[68:23] and all the other things like come kind
[68:25] from that like if you really really your
[68:27] time then at some point you will learn
[68:30] about nutrition at some point you learn
[68:32] about uh health and and and and fitness
[68:35] and stuff like that um perfect and
[68:37] before we come to the end routine which
[68:39] is the previous guest is asking a
[68:41] question for the next guest without
[68:42] knowing who the next guest is I have
[68:45] kind of new unofficial endro tee before
[68:48] that um what are you currently really
[68:50] passionate about uh which we did not
[68:52] touch on uh you can like maybe like can
[68:56] quickly go over it uh X do you want to
[68:58] start what am I currently passionate
[69:01] about yeah what are you currently
[69:03] passionate about learning about besides
[69:05] Bitcoin besides the the thing I asked
[69:08] the question because um bitcoiners are
[69:12] usually really interesting people uh at
[69:14] least most of them and and they're doing
[69:17] a lot of uh stuff they're doing uh
[69:20] different things and uh I want to have
[69:22] this podcast so bitcoiners can also like
[69:26] learn from bitcoiners outside of Bitcoin
[69:29] so I'm like now I have introduced that
[69:32] question to like see what are the
[69:34] speakers thinking right now about or
[69:37] passionate about learning about like
[69:38] whatever it is uh outside of Bitcoin
[69:42] like I mean some just come into the
[69:44] Bitcoin scene and Bitcoin is actually
[69:46] that like 100% Focus for me right now
[69:49] it's like social media and podcasting is
[69:51] like a really big Focus right now for me
[69:53] and because just just started that out
[69:55] kind of for half a year uh besides
[69:58] Bitcoin uh and so like I'm just that
[70:01] that's kind of the the aim of the
[70:02] question to to get it okay um probably
[70:07] about to give a very broad answer here
[70:09] um but I'm very like I'm a very curious
[70:13] uh person I think um that and I while
[70:17] while you were talking there I was just
[70:18] trying to think of my answer and just
[70:19] kept coming back to it and again it's
[70:22] going to be very broad but I'm I'm just
[70:24] passionate about like
[70:25] understanding about life um I think
[70:29] humans are amazing I think there's so
[70:31] much that we can do there's so much that
[70:32] we can learn um the sky isn't the limit
[70:36] like there's so much space out there you
[70:38] can you can really do whatever you you
[70:40] want in this world so I'm just
[70:41] passionate about learning passionate
[70:43] about life in
[70:45] general um that's it's a I got a pretty
[70:48] broad answer for that one I love it
[70:51] still Brad do you want to add something
[70:54] yeah sure something that comes to to
[70:56] mind for me is and it you know it
[70:59] relates with the health and fitness but
[71:01] uh I I've been practicing yoga for like
[71:03] a decade and I think like young people
[71:06] don't appreciate it as much but I'm a
[71:09] really big advocate of it because I
[71:12] really feel like it's like a one of the
[71:13] best things you can do for your body so
[71:15] like you know stretch it's obviously
[71:17] just mostly stretching but uh you know
[71:20] you know add that little bit of
[71:21] meditation that five or 10 minutes of
[71:23] meditation in there and it really clears
[71:24] your mind ET especially in this world
[71:26] we're talking about like you know Ai and
[71:29] this social media and everything that's
[71:30] moving so freaking fast in our world
[71:33] right now I'm telling you you know get
[71:35] your stretches in do some yoga do some
[71:38] meditation uh I've been trying I've been
[71:40] doing that for quite a while now and
[71:42] it's uh like to me it's a no-brainer
[71:44] like it's a lwh hanging fruit if you
[71:46] want to be a healthy person you want to
[71:48] prevent injuries prevent arthritis you
[71:50] know and as we age you know that becomes
[71:52] more and more important I'm always pre
[71:54] preaching to my mother my family I'm
[71:56] like get your stretches in do do some
[71:57] yoga do a little bit of meditation uh
[72:00] you know and and find peace uh you know
[72:02] silence your mind for a couple minutes
[72:04] there's a lot of great um uh medit
[72:06] meditation guides on YouTube that are
[72:08] 100% free uh highly recommend them and
[72:12] yeah just just find some time let your
[72:15] brain you know marinate some of the
[72:16] thoughts that you're getting all day
[72:18] long so quickly uh so that would be my
[72:20] thing practice
[72:22] yoga I love it we never had it a big
[72:25] believer in meditation and then and
[72:27] getting some calmness in this crazy
[72:31] world I mean it's is really really
[72:33] important so our end routine is uh T it
[72:36] before where the previous guest is
[72:38] asking a question for the next guest
[72:39] without knowing who the next guest
[72:40] actually is and the question is uh for
[72:44] you guys whoever wants to to start with
[72:46] it what about Bitcoin makes you
[72:50] optimistic is this this s this is the
[72:53] question from the last guest yeah
[72:55] exactly the last guest is asking a
[72:57] question without knowing who actually
[72:58] the next guest is
[73:00] so challenge is always like have have a
[73:03] question that is Broad enough uh so
[73:06] everyone can fit in there so it's it's a
[73:09] nice end routine okay can you repeat the
[73:12] question sorry uh what about Bitcoin
[73:15] makes you optimistic well the fact that
[73:17] it's the first iteration of
[73:19] decentralized money that no Central
[73:21] entity can control so meaning giving
[73:23] everybody giving everybody access access
[73:25] to a monetary tool to be able to save uh
[73:28] to be able to get our like we we were
[73:30] talking about get our freedom back so
[73:33] uh that's it gives me help for people
[73:36] you know not have to slave SL slave
[73:38] their whole lives anymore working 40 50
[73:40] you know 60 hour weeks uh you know they
[73:43] can spend time uh doing doing other
[73:45] things and just uh hopefully looking
[73:47] forward to a world of abundance rather
[73:49] than you know the world that we're in
[73:52] right now uh which we we we are in
[73:54] abundance uh in many aspects but uh you
[73:57] know in terms of you know Financial
[73:58] well-being for the masses uh that's
[74:00] something that I look forward to and you
[74:02] know just seeing less suffering less
[74:04] suffering uh I think that's all
[74:05] something we can all agree on is you
[74:07] know people want to see people other
[74:09] people flourish and do well and I think
[74:12] that's bitcoin's going to bring that to
[74:14] everybody just like the internet like
[74:16] you said earlier made so many lives
[74:17] better bitcoin's going to do that too in
[74:19] many many different ways that we're
[74:20] still exploring so uh it gives me gives
[74:23] me so much hope because it's a
[74:25] just a really big bite off the head of
[74:28] the corruption snake I would
[74:31] say I love it anything to add to to that
[74:34] X yeah for sure um well I think the
[74:38] money has been broken for thousands of
[74:40] years um if you look back at history
[74:42] they've been manipulating the money and
[74:44] the people for so long um so it's nice
[74:47] that we finally have a money that can't
[74:49] be manipulated and that does give
[74:51] everybody an equal playing field um and
[74:54] again we're we're all kind of
[74:57] um we're all kind of being manipulated
[75:00] by our governments that are taking
[75:02] advantage of us or teaching us uh a
[75:04] certain thing a certain way just so that
[75:06] way we can be good citizens and I guess
[75:08] that makes sense for a government to
[75:10] want that from um its citizens but again
[75:13] it's it's just that we have now finally
[75:15] a money that isn't that can't be
[75:18] corrupted and a money that uh they can't
[75:21] print more they can't um exactly they
[75:24] can't print more so that way the value
[75:27] or the money that's already out there is
[75:28] going to be worth less because again
[75:30] there's only going to be over 21 million
[75:32] so um just the fact that it's the money
[75:34] that is that finally Works uh because
[75:37] the money has been broken for so long
[75:39] and now gives people across the world a
[75:41] chance um to live the lives that they
[75:44] deserve because we're all humans and
[75:47] this is this is our planet they should
[75:49] be able to go anywhere regardless of um
[75:52] what your nationality is what the color

[77:47] Bradley mines on on X and yeah we're uh
[77:52] we're looking forward to continue to
[77:54] connect it should should be a very
[77:55] exciting year uh Robin have you been
[77:57] over to Canada or the us at all
[78:00] unfortunately not it's it's a big big
[78:02] embarrassment for for me that I've not
[78:04] been there at all uh not America not
[78:07] Canada not El Salvador nothing of that I
[78:10] have
[78:11] to well you have a lot around you so I
[78:14] mean I don't I don't blame you there's
[78:16] probably a lot more interesting stuff
[78:17] around where you are than where where X
[78:19] and I are but uh I mean the most of my
[78:23] listeners and Watchers actually from
[78:25] America and Canada like if you calculate
[78:28] America and Canada together and even
[78:30] like South America and Mexico and in
[78:33] Salvador then you're like 50 60% of of
[78:36] the Watchers and listeners are from that
[78:38] area and the rest from kind of like
[78:41] Europe India Africa and all all those
[78:44] areas uh so most of them are actually
[78:47] far away from me and I definitely want
[78:49] to come to also like um conferences
[78:53] there but yeah this this year I'm like
[78:55] in Bitcoin prag and next year I have
[78:59] already uh trained my mind to like I'm
[79:02] on all the conferences like I will I
[79:04] will go all I want to be in Canada on
[79:06] conferences I want in in American
[79:08] conferences I I just want to go on all
[79:10] conferences meet the people speak with
[79:12] them and and be really present in real
[79:15] life because as we talked about about AI
[79:18] about deep fakes and all this stuff at
[79:21] least for now you cannot deep fake
[79:22] someone in real life so uh let's enjoy
[79:25] the the the real life conversations the
[79:28] real life interactions as long as we
[79:30] have it
[79:32] now that's the best way to do it that's
[79:34] the best way to do it absolutely yeah
[79:37] perfect then thank you Brad for being on
