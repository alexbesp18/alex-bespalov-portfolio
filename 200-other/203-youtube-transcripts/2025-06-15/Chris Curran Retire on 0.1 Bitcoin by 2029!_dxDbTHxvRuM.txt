[00:00] by
[00:00] 2029 you could retire on 0.1 Bitcoin how
[00:04] is Bitcoin not going to take over the
[00:07] Global Financial system in terms of the
[00:09] Bitcoin cycle pretty much within a month
[00:12] like October November we should start
[00:13] going up for real we'll pass our alltime
[00:16] high start going to 100K next year is
[00:18] obviously The Big Year everyone was
[00:19] saying ooh these big institutions are
[00:22] adopting Bitcoin and me and many others
[00:24] said no no no it's the other way around
[00:27] Bitcoin is adopting these big
[00:29] institutions bitcoin's going to grow in
[00:31] value and so instead of working a 40h
[00:34] hour per week job at some point maybe I
[00:37] just need a part-time job with 10 hours
[00:39] or 15 hours so I can work less at a job
[00:42] and have more creative time for myself
[00:44] Bitcoin is the great uniter of people
[00:47] cuz everybody can use Bitcoin it's just
[00:49] like eating food or breathing air do
[00:51] certain people need different air no we
[00:53] all breath
[00:55] [Music]
[00:57] air um why did you um make that video
[01:02] around how can you retire on Z 0.1
[01:05] Bitcoin why exactly that number and how
[01:08] do you think about that yeah so it's
[01:09] actually a segment I saw on another
[01:11] Bitcoin show uh and they were talking
[01:14] there was a web page that had a that had
[01:16] a calculator and you put in how much
[01:19] Bitcoin you have and the rate of
[01:21] inflation the Fiat rate of inflation and
[01:24] then the
[01:25] Bitcoin uh the Bitcoin price how much
[01:28] it's going up and you you can sort of
[01:31] figure out when you can retire and you
[01:33] know if you have 10 Bitcoin or one or
[01:35] anything you put in whatever you want
[01:38] and and they did all these calculations
[01:40] with 0.1 Bitcoin and it was pretty
[01:44] fascinating even some it was saying like
[01:46] by
[01:47] 2029 you could retire on 0.1 Bitcoin but
[01:51] anyway the whole idea let me step back
[01:53] is is that you know I've been in the
[01:56] Bitcoin space since 2016 basically and
[01:59] I've seen a lot of people say you know
[02:02] oh if you have one Bitcoin that's all
[02:04] you're going to need is one Bitcoin
[02:06] going into the future then you'll be set
[02:08] for life and all this stuff and then I
[02:10] saw the number come down over the past
[02:13] few years to now it's 0.1 and I was like
[02:16] really you're gonna be able to retire on
[02:19] 0.1
[02:20] Bitcoin and and the and the re and but
[02:23] it's actually true and the other part of
[02:26] it too is that normal people I mean who
[02:29] who can buy buy one Bitcoin now right
[02:32] $58,000 right now
[02:34] today not many people can just you know
[02:36] go into their pocket and get out their
[02:38] wallet and buy one Bitcoin so 0.1 seems
[02:41] a lot more uh doable and anyway this is
[02:45] all just speculation right because we
[02:47] don't exactly know what's going to
[02:49] happen but but it is exciting for sure
[02:53] there's this model of Jesse Meers that
[02:56] has uh basically said oh we have 900
[03:00] trillion US dollars in the total um as a
[03:03] total wealth and then it's like okay if
[03:06] Bitcoin is successful how much of that
[03:09] can Bitcoin actually uh capture and I
[03:12] have my theories around that but before
[03:14] I I I tell you that what do you think uh
[03:17] there are a lot of different theories
[03:19] like with conservative like 20% I heard
[03:21] from 20% to 99% I heard everything uh so
[03:25] so what do you think is realistic that
[03:28] Bitcoin actually cover
[03:30] if Bitcoin is successful with no time
[03:32] limit on that because that that could be
[03:34] in 50 years that could be in 5,000 years
[03:37] I have no clue about the timeline that's
[03:39] the hard part but I think if it's
[03:41] successful if we use it as a store of
[03:43] value uh what would you say is the
[03:46] realistic capturing of Bitcoin of the
[03:49] total net assets So my answer is I don't
[03:51] know I'm actually not like an economist
[03:55] I'm just a normal guy who I I I was
[03:59] producing ing I'm I'm a podcast producer
[04:02] that's what I was doing and I was
[04:05] producing a show for Laura Shin her
[04:07] Unchained show I was producing her show
[04:09] for the first four years so that's how I
[04:12] got to learn about Bitcoin I had never
[04:13] heard of it before that and and even
[04:16] when I heard about it I didn't buy in
[04:18] for another couple years which was
[04:20] obviously big mistake but anyway um but
[04:24] yeah so I'm not an economist I'm an
[04:26] audio engineer and I'm an artist and I
[04:28] make fractals and so anyway how much of
[04:32] this how much of the global wealth is
[04:34] going to go into Bitcoin to me as a lay
[04:36] person it it
[04:38] it's like when I read the Bitcoin
[04:41] standard I got
[04:43] it and I understand now how Bitcoin is
[04:46] sound money and and so from a principles
[04:50] standpoint I understand now how Bitcoin
[04:53] is better than everything and anything
[04:55] that's ever existed and so and I've seen
[04:59] how it acts over the last what eight
[05:01] years now so from my own eyes looking at
[05:04] the charts and also understanding the
[05:06] fundamentals from a basic level uh
[05:09] there's just no stopping Bitcoin like
[05:11] who like how is it gonna like how is
[05:14] Bitcoin not going to take over the
[05:18] Global Financial system over time it's
[05:21] going to happen it's already happening
[05:25] and so I don't know how much but I think
[05:26] it's funny when when you know cuz
[05:30] earlier this year early in 2024 we had
[05:32] these the spot ETFs right with the black
[05:35] rock and FID Fidelity and Arc and
[05:39] everyone was saying ooh these big
[05:41] institutions are adopting Bitcoin and me
[05:44] and many others said no no no it's the
[05:46] other way around Bitcoin is adopting
[05:48] these big institutions and so that's
[05:51] that's how I feel I don't know the
[05:52] percentages I don't know the trillions I
[05:54] don't know anything like that but I'm
[05:56] just very bullish on the future cuz I
[05:59] don't see how it can be
[06:01] stopped I love the perspective that
[06:03] Bitcoin is
[06:04] adopting ETFs what was your uh what was
[06:08] your expectation of of the ETFs when you
[06:10] when when you looked at it uh well again
[06:12] I didn't know because I don't know how
[06:16] many people there are in the world that
[06:17] are buying ETFs I mean I know people
[06:20] have it in their retirement accounts and
[06:21] stuff like that but but yeah it's just I
[06:24] just thought it would be a a major
[06:26] adoption and in fact you know members of
[06:28] my family
[06:30] have money basically locked up in a
[06:33] 401k and it was great to be able to just
[06:36] move some money over to the spot Bitcoin
[06:39] ETF and I know there are Bitcoin Maxis
[06:42] out there who are like oh my God that's
[06:44] not Bitcoin blah blah blah but we all
[06:47] know that if you have money locked up in
[06:50] your 401k it's a pain in the rump to
[06:54] take it out pay the penalties it's a
[06:56] whole mess it's not worth it let's put
[06:59] it that way so in in the few years or
[07:03] let's say in the decade before
[07:05] retirement it's it's probably better if
[07:08] you have money locked in a 401k just put
[07:10] it in the spot Bitcoin ETF until you
[07:12] retire now that's not Financial advice
[07:15] maybe that's wrong I don't know let me
[07:16] know in the
[07:18] comments interesting um shortly back to
[07:22] what you said with with Laura um you
[07:25] produced a show was it that time where
[07:27] you got orange pilled um
[07:30] I guess so it was so it was a weird
[07:32] situation so I was producing her show
[07:34] for about two years and I was learning
[07:37] about Bitcoin right because I was
[07:39] sitting in on every interview she did
[07:42] literally uh and so I was learning about
[07:46] Bitcoin but again I'm not a financial
[07:48] guy so I didn't really understand the
[07:50] impact and then something happened in
[07:52] the fall of 2018 for
[07:54] me um it was kind of a mystical
[07:58] experience which I don't know how much I
[08:00] should get into but anyway there was a
[08:02] time when I just I got this
[08:05] feeling that it was like a it was almost
[08:08] like a feeling or almost like a direct
[08:10] message but it wasn't it wasn't like
[08:12] someone speaking words to me but it was
[08:15] like you gota you gotta buy Bitcoin like
[08:18] that was the idea right that I just felt
[08:20] it and I was like oh yeah I get and
[08:22] maybe it was the two years working with
[08:24] Laura maybe it all added up
[08:26] subconsciously and then my mind just
[08:27] told me you got to buy Bitcoin so that's
[08:30] in the fall of 2018 is when I finally
[08:32] bought in but back then I didn't I mean
[08:35] obviously since then I've learned every
[08:38] day right because I'm watching creators
[08:40] I'm watching amazing
[08:43] bitcoiners uh talk about Bitcoin I've
[08:46] read the Bitcoin standard and some other
[08:48] uh well that's the only book so far but
[08:50] I have a few other books to read um but
[08:53] anyway when I first bought in in 2018 I
[08:55] didn't understand it fully like I like I
[08:58] do now I didn't know what it was I just
[09:00] knew that like this is this is different
[09:05] and this is something special even back
[09:07] then you look at the chart you see you
[09:09] see where what happens so uh yeah it's
[09:13] interesting I brought them up again
[09:15] because I think if you study Bitcoin
[09:17] long enough uh forcefully or not
[09:20] forcefully for me for you maybe
[09:22] forcefully because you have to sit there
[09:24] and watch two years of of Bitcoin
[09:27] podcast um you you you kind of have to
[09:30] do it like it's it's not it's not
[09:32] optional at some point if if you exposed
[09:35] to um a bitcoiner long enough you will
[09:38] get the bitcoiner yourself H and it's
[09:41] it's it's funny how how it goes and and
[09:44] and it's it's really interesting why
[09:48] this is happening that's why I always
[09:49] ask like okay like you were exposed to
[09:51] two years of podcasting um maybe if it
[09:55] were would have been about something
[09:56] else maybe it would have not have
[09:58] happened uh uh and so Bitcoin is kind of
[10:01] like this extremely attractive asset
[10:04] that you're like if if you see it long
[10:06] enough you're like I I want a piece of
[10:09] that I want to have something of that
[10:11] what do you think makes Bitcoin so
[10:14] attractive uh for you well one of the
[10:16] biggest things for me is that it removes
[10:19] money from
[10:20] State I think that is like once I
[10:23] realized that that was it for me I was
[10:25] like why are we letting these criminals
[10:28] literally run run the money system and
[10:30] scam us every day like that's literally
[10:32] what fiat currency is and I'll argue
[10:35] with anybody about that and you and we
[10:38] have an army of people behind me that
[10:40] will argue with me and it's not it's not
[10:43] a difficult argument either right anyone
[10:46] who looks into fiat currency says oh my
[10:48] God this is what this is what Fiat is
[10:50] this is garbage is absolute toilet paper
[10:53] and so um once I realized that's one of
[10:56] the biggest things for me getting money
[10:58] away from State the state countries
[11:01] right have have been ramping up their
[11:03] authoritarian power over time they're
[11:06] taking away more and more freedoms and
[11:07] Liberties every day from people and
[11:10] there's nothing the people can do
[11:12] because this the state controls the
[11:14] money and so once we take money away
[11:17] from
[11:18] State it's going to open up a whole new
[11:20] world it already is and once we take
[11:23] social media away from these big
[11:25] centralized platforms and we start using
[11:29] nost I don't know I mean I think you're
[11:31] on Noster right yeah yeah so uh I mean
[11:34] nost is great so these decentralized
[11:37] Freedom Tech Protocols are the way of
[11:41] the future I believe we're going to look
[11:43] back at uh especially for social media
[11:46] we're going to look back at like the
[11:48] first 20 years of social media let's say
[11:50] 2004 to 2024 we're going to look back at
[11:53] that 20year era as the dinosaur age and
[11:58] the the stupid age of social media like
[12:00] why did we give all our power to these
[12:02] centralized platforms and let them ban
[12:05] us for no reason and and not even give
[12:07] us an explanation right so um so
[12:11] separating money from state is a big one
[12:15] and that's and also having no
[12:17] intermediaries like in in terms of
[12:20] Bitcoin it's great we can we can
[12:23] interact with Bitcoin with each other we
[12:24] don't need a bank like why why have a
[12:27] bank like that's another question that
[12:30] traditional economists or traditional
[12:33] Finance people they can't they can't
[12:34] answer that they'll say oh because the
[12:36] bank protects you and we're looking out
[12:38] for your best interest I call BS on that
[12:42] and so those are a few of the things why
[12:45] a few of the reasons why I really uh
[12:47] appreciate the value of Bitcoin I
[12:50] actually tell people I think Bitcoin is
[12:52] the invention of our
[12:54] lifetimes and and that may seem
[12:56] hyperbolic and maybe it is okay but I
[12:59] smoke a lot of hopium I just want to
[13:01] tell everybody
[13:03] openly
[13:07] anyway it's a it's a good thing to smoke
[13:10] I love the social media uh comparison I
[13:13] think you kind of compare it to to the
[13:15] banks right now uh that that we have
[13:17] with like the the power that they have
[13:19] over the data and stuff like that and I
[13:21] think a an amazing part of that is just
[13:25] because there is Nostra this makes
[13:29] the uh other social medias better I 100%
[13:34] sure IL musk is aware of Nostra and he's
[13:38] aware if he does too much on X people
[13:41] are jumping ship because people want are
[13:43] on X because of freedom of speech
[13:45] otherwise it could also be on Facebook
[13:48] or platforms that have even less freedom
[13:51] of speech than on X so people that are
[13:54] on X are very Pro freedom of speech and
[13:58] very
[13:59] conscious about the freedom of speech so
[14:01] people like e mask are very aware of
[14:04] something like Nostra H and and they
[14:07] will be very careful with Banning
[14:10] someone or Shadow Banning with them just
[14:12] because there is Noster if there would
[14:13] not be Noster he could have done way
[14:16] more because he's already the most
[14:19] freedom of speech mainstream platform if
[14:21] there's not even an exit wealth that
[14:23] would be I feel like very dangerous uh
[14:26] for social media platforms so I'm I'm
[14:28] really hopeful also with YouTube there
[14:31] is Rumble uh Rumble is an amazing
[14:33] platform for for video content because
[14:35] axe tries to be a video platform but it
[14:38] is not I see it in the numbers uh nobody
[14:42] like I have way more followers on Ax
[14:44] than on YouTube and nobody watches the
[14:46] podcast all on on X they all switching
[14:50] to rumble to YouTube to the podcast
[14:52] platforms to Fountain to all of those
[14:54] most of them switch to YouTube uh but
[14:58] that's kind of like where where I'm
[15:00] going like only the possibility of
[15:03] having that freedom of speech with an
[15:05] Nostra it's it's it's amazing to have
[15:07] with the bank comparison I love that
[15:09] what you
[15:10] said really cool yeah it's really
[15:13] heartening right it makes you like CU I
[15:16] always think what if we didn't have
[15:18] Bitcoin imagine the world without
[15:20] Bitcoin and therefore we don't have
[15:22] Noster either right so take Bitcoin and
[15:24] Noster out of existence and man that is
[15:29] a bleak existence like what again once
[15:32] you start realizing the truth that all
[15:35] governments are just absolute 100%
[15:37] corrupt garbage authoritarian
[15:41] authoritarians and the money is captured
[15:44] and the money is all literally the US
[15:46] dollar is a fake currency with nothing
[15:48] behind it and it's it's ruining
[15:50] everybody's lives while the rich get
[15:51] richer so Bitcoin and Noster are Our
[15:55] Saviors and that I I really believe that
[15:59] what would you do if we didn't had
[16:01] Bitcoin and Nostra uh to have the most
[16:05] Freedom possible I don't know I mean I I
[16:08] guess I can look at look back at my life
[16:10] before I knew about Bitcoin and and well
[16:13] Noster is very new right noar's like
[16:16] started in 2022 in Earnest I think maybe
[16:20] it was started in 2021 but anyway um no
[16:24] before Bitcoin and noar I think I just
[16:26] I've always been a person to just live
[16:28] my life and um I I I'm I'm I'm sort of
[16:33] like I'm like the guy
[16:35] who it's hard for me to have an office
[16:38] job and where there's politics I can't I
[16:41] can't exist in that situation at all
[16:43] because I'll be fired in within 15
[16:46] minutes I'll just ask two questions and
[16:48] be like look dude what are you doing you
[16:50] can't do this that's stupid and then it
[16:52] be like uh please come into our office
[16:55] and they would fire me um but yeah no I
[16:58] would just uh I mean we can all live our
[17:01] lives with this level of Freedom right
[17:02] we can do what we want part of it is
[17:05] getting in touch with your inner self
[17:07] right your spiritual existence that's
[17:09] another focus of mine my wife and I
[17:12] stream two meditation streams every week
[17:14] uh it's called lightness meditation you
[17:16] can find it on YouTube and we stream two
[17:19] meditation sessions because I've been
[17:21] practicing meditation for more than 20
[17:23] years and it's the single most important
[17:27] thing I've ever done in my life for my
[17:29] own personal
[17:31] development uh learning how to regulate
[17:33] my mind learning what my mind is and
[17:37] then un you know spending time to
[17:40] understand it because it's it's not
[17:42] something that's easily understandable
[17:44] uh but I think really focusing on
[17:48] yourself and focusing on your own
[17:51] creativity is what I've always done
[17:53] right I'm a musician I play in bands I
[17:55] create fractal art um I'm writing a
[17:58] novel now so I for me it's creativity I
[18:02] I like to create things maybe for many
[18:05] people it's you know cooking or uh
[18:08] obviously children right that's the most
[18:10] creative thing you can do right is have
[18:12] children and and create children and
[18:15] work with them and and enjoy them and uh
[18:19] be there for them uh be with them during
[18:22] their Journey so for me it's a lot of
[18:25] its creativity and that and I'm going to
[18:28] do that regard of what happens in my
[18:30] life uh but it just so happens that
[18:35] Bitcoin
[18:36] specifically is going to allow artists
[18:40] and creative people to do more of their
[18:44] art because we're going to have to you
[18:47] know in the future as Bitcoin continues
[18:51] up people who have Bitcoin that Bitcoin
[18:54] is going to grow in value and so instead
[18:58] of working
[18:59] a 40 hour per week
[19:02] job at some point maybe I just need a
[19:04] part-time job with with 10 hours or 15
[19:07] hours so I can work less at a job and
[19:11] and use more have more creative time for
[19:14] myself so cre so I guess my answer is is
[19:18] uh
[19:19] creativity interesting um I I want to
[19:23] quickly go into that even though it has
[19:25] nothing to do with Bitcoin but I think
[19:26] it's really important uh why is
[19:28] meditation so important yeah so in
[19:31] today's world we focus a lot on our
[19:33] bodies Our physical existence but we get
[19:36] we almost we give literally zero
[19:38] attention to our minds our mind is a
[19:41] tool and you know you're what for in and
[19:44] when you go to school and you learn
[19:49] facts that's you're you're learning
[19:51] facts but you're not learning how to use
[19:53] your mind you're not learning what your
[19:55] mind is your mind is the most powerful
[19:58] thing you have your body it is what it
[20:01] is Robin you're never going to be a 7
[20:04] foot5 black basketball player I promise
[20:07] you you're never going to be that ever
[20:12] sorry you are you that's who you are
[20:15] your physical existence you can't change
[20:17] it very much right on the other side of
[20:20] the spectrum you have your soul whatever
[20:22] that is right no one really knows if if
[20:24] anyone's honest they'll tell you we
[20:26] don't really know what that is but on
[20:28] the other hand you have your soul that
[20:30] also you can't change because you don't
[20:31] even know what it is so what's between
[20:33] your body and your soul is your mind
[20:36] your mind is the only thing in your life
[20:39] that you actually have control over it's
[20:42] the only thing you can actually change
[20:44] it's the only thing you can develop to a
[20:47] significant degree other than lifting
[20:49] weights and getting some muscles which
[20:51] is fine so the mind is everything and
[20:54] our culture ignores the
[20:57] mind all the Powers you have in your
[20:59] mind which are
[21:01] vast no one thinks about it no one talks
[21:04] about it no one develops it so what
[21:06] meditation does is it it allows you to
[21:10] sit down and sort of regulate your mind
[21:13] because our minds are always like this
[21:16] even when people sleep their mind is so
[21:19] when you start to relax your mind and
[21:21] bring it down bring the the level of
[21:23] thoughts down and then you can you sort
[21:27] of you then you sort of step above your
[21:30] mind and then you can sort of see your
[21:33] mind and see yourself and so if you sort
[21:37] of zoom out and you can observe your
[21:40] mind if you can observe your mind then
[21:43] what are you that's the question sit
[21:45] down meditate think about it it's it's
[21:48] the most amazing thing anyone can do to
[21:50] learn about yourself and to unfold the
[21:53] greatest reality for yourself is is
[21:56] meditation I love that aware of of of
[21:59] that but I think meditation is the one
[22:02] and I'm really a habit guy I'm a routine
[22:04] guy I have the daily podcast routine
[22:07] that I do daily gym and stuff like that
[22:10] uh but meditation is the one thing that
[22:12] I'm really struggling to keep it up I
[22:14] always have like phes where like do it
[22:16] for months and then like oh [ __ ] like
[22:18] stopped it again that that's why I
[22:20] always ask like why is it important so
[22:22] to keep reminding me oh yeah it is
[22:25] important Robin do it you know it uh go
[22:28] go over yourself and actually do go
[22:30] ahead and do it because I know it's
[22:31] really
[22:32] important and really cool
[22:35] um you want to say something oh I was
[22:38] just going to say sometimes finding a
[22:40] finding Lo a local group or local people
[22:43] that you can meditate with and that's
[22:45] handy also
[22:48] um people do like me and my wife we do
[22:51] live streams we only do two a week and
[22:53] it's probably at the wrong time but so
[22:55] what I'm saying is sort of surround
[22:56] yourself with some more people who are
[22:58] into meditation and that'll help you
[23:00] sort of uh keep going yeah ah yeah I
[23:04] think that that's a that's a great one
[23:06] um why do you think uh I see that in in
[23:10] Bitcoin as so much I interview so many
[23:11] bitcoiners why do you think a
[23:14] bitcoiners so great in health in
[23:17] nutrition and fitness and all all those
[23:19] important areas I feel like when you go
[23:22] to a Bitcoin conference you see uh a
[23:25] little bit more healthier people
[23:28] littleit with fitter people a little bit
[23:30] more mindful people it's fascinating to
[23:32] see for me and I often ask myself why
[23:35] this is that uh do you really think that
[23:38] like the the fundamental basis money um
[23:42] actually influences the the person
[23:44] himself if they use different form of
[23:47] money I don't know if it's the money but
[23:50] this idea of proof of work has always
[23:53] fascinated me because that idea of proof
[23:56] of work is a Transcendent idea
[23:59] it is a natural
[24:00] idea you know that's how nature works
[24:03] right proof of work there's no other way
[24:05] nature Works nature doesn't you know the
[24:08] the trees don't borrow dirt from from
[24:12] the the mountain or the or the mountain
[24:14] lions or you know in in nature
[24:18] everything is proof of work you got to
[24:20] do it right now to do it right now and
[24:23] um so the fact that Bitcoin
[24:26] introduced this idea of well maybe it
[24:28] didn't introduce it but Bitcoin
[24:30] popularized this idea of proof of work
[24:33] and then you can take that idea of proof
[24:35] of work and start aiming it at different
[24:38] things in your life even like you said
[24:41] meditation practice well we could talk
[24:43] about meditation all day but we all know
[24:46] that sitting down and meditating is the
[24:48] is the thing that we should be doing so
[24:51] that's so talking about it is eh but
[24:54] doing it is that's the work right so you
[24:57] can look at anything and think of proof
[24:58] of work and also it just shines the
[25:02] light of Truth on everything Bitcoin is
[25:04] like the greatest disinfectant ever it's
[25:07] just so simple and pure Bitcoin is pure
[25:09] and when you sort
[25:11] of when you sort of have the ideas of
[25:13] Bitcoin in mind and you look at other
[25:15] things you you can sort of see through
[25:18] the like you you you see those other
[25:20] things in a in a better light and so you
[25:23] can even like for food isn't there a
[25:26] book called Fiat food I think
[25:29] I have not read that but I want to read
[25:31] that oh my God and my and get it from my
[25:33] wife too uh but yeah you could look at
[25:36] everything and say it's Fiat food or
[25:39] Fiat meditation or uh Fiat Landscaping
[25:44] right like there anything anything can
[25:45] be Fe you you this scale of Bitcoin
[25:49] versus Fiat it's very interesting to
[25:51] apply it to other areas and um so the
[25:54] proof of work in my opinion is one of
[25:57] the most interesting points about
[25:59] Bitcoin that sort of translates into
[26:02] other areas of life yeah I love it a lot
[26:05] and yeah Fiat food uh it's a book from
[26:09] Matthew and Matthew was already on the
[26:12] podcast I think if if people want to
[26:13] check it out it's like 20 episodes back
[26:15] or something like that but if you go
[26:18] ahead and then just search Matthew I
[26:21] think L Luci luak something like that uh
[26:24] is his last name on my channel you will
[26:26] easily find it and those fascinating and
[26:29] he really showed how how money
[26:33] incentivized the wrong decisions in the
[26:36] food supply and the food supply is the
[26:39] one that that gets us because we just go
[26:42] blindly to the supermarket and pick
[26:44] things out uh and and and then the the
[26:47] cheap things come in because people
[26:49] really don't like if the prices go up so
[26:52] if if you have then the incentives to
[26:54] not go up with the price you have to
[26:57] come down with the qu quality uh so
[27:00] that's what the like I think that's my
[27:02] main takeaway from that book that um
[27:06] when we have cheap money prices go up
[27:08] people don't like uh pricing going up
[27:11] too much so they figure out new ways of
[27:15] producing food that's just cheaper and
[27:17] has a wider margin uh to play with if
[27:20] prices go up so that's something I was
[27:24] like oh wow that that makes a lot of
[27:26] sense how how cheap money influences
[27:29] what we eat uh and then basically
[27:33] introduces yeah cheap food that we
[27:36] should not eat and should uh basically
[27:39] avoid and it's gets really hard if it's
[27:43] only that in the supermarket it's only
[27:45] that what what we have yeah I recently
[27:47] saw a meme it was like like a bowl of
[27:51] fruit or or a package of fruit and it
[27:55] costs like $8 and then next to it was
[27:58] like some Fiat food some grain some some
[28:01] other garbage food it was like 59 cents
[28:05] or something and it's like why why is
[28:08] good food so much more expensive than
[28:11] garbage anyway that's quote the question
[28:13] but
[28:15] yeah really interesting um what is your
[28:19] most controversial opinion about Bitcoin
[28:21] would you say
[28:23] um I don't know I I mean I guess okay
[28:26] the only thing that came to mind is is
[28:28] the fact that I've spoken out
[28:30] against uh some Bitcoin Maxis at times
[28:34] you know some people who are Bitcoin
[28:36] maximalists now being a Bitcoin
[28:39] maximalist per se is not bad because I
[28:42] guess if if you're going to go buy a
[28:44] simple definition I think I am a Bitcoin
[28:46] maximalist but what I really don't like
[28:49] is Bitcoin Maxis who are they just trash
[28:54] everything else and they trash people so
[28:57] for instance on Noster right Noster is a
[28:59] protocol and everyone is welcome but you
[29:02] still have Bitcoin Maxis on there who if
[29:06] someone mentions
[29:07] Monero they'll bash it and I mean hard
[29:11] and so some people might call that toxic
[29:13] whatever I I don't like that word
[29:15] because of the context it's been used in
[29:18] but the fact is um that's not helpful
[29:24] but it's okay that they do it I'm not
[29:25] saying they can't do it people can be as
[29:27] toxic or as people can be as horrible as
[29:31] they want to be it's f it that's their
[29:33] right but uh my point is that it it's
[29:37] not helping and and and the reason it's
[29:40] not helping is because I feel people
[29:43] need to go through a process of learning
[29:45] about crypto and Bitcoin I did when I
[29:49] first bought I bought Bitcoin ethereum I
[29:51] bought Litecoin I bought a bunch of
[29:53] coins but mostly Bitcoin because I
[29:56] didn't know anything and other people
[29:58] online were saying that these are good
[30:00] that's good so I did it over time I
[30:03] realized yeah these other things they're
[30:06] they're not that good they're not good
[30:08] for me so I had to go through a learning
[30:12] process with Bitcoin and crypto and
[30:16] nfts I actually posted some nfts three
[30:19] years ago and I had a guy who was maybe
[30:22] going to be a co-host on a show with me
[30:25] he found out I had nfts three years ago
[30:27] and he literally stopped talking to me
[30:29] he wouldn't answer my emails or
[30:31] anything so that's the level of
[30:33] retardation that I don't like and again
[30:36] they can back that way all they want I
[30:38] don't it's fine you're free to be as big
[30:41] of an a-hole as you want to be please go
[30:44] ahead but I just think in the the world
[30:47] is changing this is a new paradigm and
[30:50] people when they first get in people are
[30:52] going to make mistakes people are going
[30:53] to buy [ __ ] coins and we have to tell
[30:57] them the truth about it for sure but we
[30:59] can't just be a-holes and so when I see
[31:03] people being like that it I don't like
[31:06] it and so some there's been a time or
[31:08] two where I kind of went off a little
[31:10] bit just a little because again they
[31:12] have a right to be a-holes if they want
[31:15] and I that's fine uh so that I guess
[31:18] that's one area where maybe my take is
[31:20] controversial I don't know if it is I
[31:22] really don't care uh but but I guess it
[31:25] is that controversial to you Robin if
[31:27] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:30] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:32] bought some Bitcoin and now the most

[33:16] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[33:19] amazing I love them so much it was
[33:21] really hard for me to pick the one that
[33:23] I want to have because there are a lot
[33:25] of great options I went with the new
[33:27] transparency Edition they're all limited
[33:31] so grab yours those will not be
[33:33] available for a long time but there will
[33:35] come new models and new amazing designs
[33:38] along the way it's it's not
[33:39] controversial to me at all um I even
[33:43] have on my Channel people that say I
[33:47] have another coin that's like it's it's
[33:51] a little bit saying like oh yeah I'm
[33:53] like I'm cheating on my wife like like a
[33:58] when people say that like I'm a Bitcoin
[34:00] Max I only have Bitcoin uh and I truly
[34:04] think that everything else will go to
[34:06] zero uh or to a value very close to zero
[34:11] uh because maybe it finds some small
[34:13] small Niche group that finds value in it
[34:16] but most importantly um I'm curious and
[34:21] I want to talk to the people I want to
[34:24] find out why they think like that and
[34:26] how they think about it uh and what they
[34:28] think about and I'm a free free market
[34:32] maximalist that's what I always say like
[34:34] I think uh if you're a free market
[34:37] maximalist first of all I think you kind
[34:39] of tend to be a Bitcoin maximalist
[34:41] because Bitcoin enables a free market uh
[34:44] but uh it's like both kind of play into
[34:47] each other but I think we should not
[34:49] stop talking to people uh that have like
[34:52] it feels like oh he has been SED like we
[34:55] can never like like even if you're like
[34:58] religious like we should forgive people
[35:00] like that that that's that's that's okay
[35:02] to make mistakes Michael sailor uh
[35:05] trashed on bitcoin once we forg forgave
[35:08] him let let's forgive people let's let
[35:10] them make mistakes I think that's really
[35:13] important uh and so the the question
[35:15] also do you do you think we are not
[35:17] welcoming enough I think I think we are
[35:19] I think the Bitcoin Community is very
[35:21] welcoming these people who are the toxic
[35:24] Maxis let's call them toxic Max even
[35:26] though I hate that word toxic
[35:28] but uh there they are very few and far
[35:31] between overall I think so but I I think
[35:35] in general bitcoiners are very welcoming
[35:37] for sure I
[35:39] mean it it it's Bitcoin
[35:42] is you could call it the great uniter of
[35:46] people of religions right because
[35:48] everybody can use Bitcoin it's just like
[35:51] eating food or you know breathing air
[35:55] like do do certain people need different
[35:57] air no we all breathe air but we can all
[36:00] be different but we can all breathe air
[36:02] and eat food and so bitcoin's the same
[36:04] thing
[36:05] Bitcoin uh is good for everybody and
[36:08] there's and and Bitcoin doesn't
[36:09] differentiate right Bitcoin doesn't say
[36:12] oh it's better for Americans but it's
[36:14] not so good for Australians no it's good
[36:17] for everybody doesn't matter your
[36:19] culture your language nothing matters
[36:22] Bitcoin is is is a uniter in that way
[36:26] and so I think in general the
[36:28] the the Bitcoin uh Community is very
[36:32] welcoming uh and and for different
[36:34] reasons right some are some are like me
[36:36] who want to separate money from State
[36:38] other people and we know in the
[36:39] developing World they most people don't
[36:44] have bank accounts and they to to have
[36:45] an easy way to transfer value is is
[36:49] amazing that's a literally life-changing
[36:51] for them so there's different reasons
[36:53] people like Bitcoin but we're all on the
[36:55] same team with it and I I think it's
[36:57] really amazing
[37:01] obviously yeah it's I think I think we
[37:04] should um like I think the the toxicity
[37:08] comes a little bit from all those block
[37:10] siiz wars and all those really hard
[37:12] Knuckles that have that Bitcoin had to
[37:14] go through uh so I have a lot of empathy
[37:17] with with that and I didn't live through
[37:19] that like I didn't live through the
[37:21] block size Wars uh and and I feel like
[37:24] there's a lot of there's also a big
[37:27] difference between Twitter and real life
[37:31] I noticed like if if someone is outraged
[37:34] on Twitter this doesn't mean he's like
[37:36] uh so toxic as he is on Twitter on in in
[37:39] real life there's like a really big
[37:41] difference there um also like with with
[37:44] with Twitter and having them on a show
[37:46] and talking to them that's also like I
[37:48] I've seen a big difference there just
[37:50] because yeah in Twitter has has this
[37:52] format of tying one thing down in a very
[37:55] small format uh you have to be very
[37:58] precise and very um small you cannot go
[38:01] out and and talk long then I have a
[38:03] podcast where I talk half an hour one
[38:06] hour sometimes even two two hours um and
[38:09] then we kind of really go ahead and and
[38:11] make those conclusions long uh with a
[38:13] with a long haul so that I'm aware of uh
[38:19] sometimes uh when you get a comment on
[38:21] YouTube or a reply on Twitter or you get
[38:24] a nost for something it can feel a lot
[38:28] more toxic than that person actually is
[38:31] um just because Al there's no emotions
[38:33] to that like it's just taxt uh but in
[38:36] general I think the Bitcoin Community is
[38:39] the most helpful uh and loving community
[38:42] at all like I had so many great guests
[38:45] on before I even had a real podcast uh
[38:50] like Jeff boof came on my podcast when I
[38:52] had like 200 subscribers like that that
[38:55] that speaks miles to to hit him and the
[38:57] Bitcoin community so I that that's kind
[39:00] of my my conclusion to that uh
[39:03] bitcoiners are curious and they're
[39:05] really humble uh and they're really
[39:07] loving and caring uh but yeah there
[39:10] there's definitely a group that is that
[39:12] is toxic I don't I also don't like that
[39:14] word uh but it mostly comes out on
[39:17] Twitter and doesn't come out on
[39:20] conferences uh and and stuff like that
[39:23] for sure yeah and one one thing I
[39:24] thought of when you were mentioning that
[39:26] that that the people posting on Twitter
[39:29] with text only short amount of text only
[39:32] is not adequate for communication it
[39:34] reminds me of that old study where they
[39:36] said 55% of communication is visual 38%
[39:41] is auditory so voice and only 7% is uh
[39:49] basically text you could think of it
[39:50] that way so on Twitter when people are
[39:52] posting you're not getting the visual of
[39:55] them you can't see them and and in
[39:58] communication there's so many visual
[40:00] cues that people
[40:02] give and so in Twitter you miss all the
[40:04] visual cues so the 55% gone and the
[40:08] auditory also you know you can tell more
[40:12] from a person's voice than you can
[40:14] imagine I mean if I was to speak
[40:16] monotone and I was on the show and I was
[40:19] talking about Bitcoin and everything was
[40:22] good and as right that's obviously
[40:25] that's a robot but me you could can just
[40:27] by my the inflections of my voice you
[40:29] can tell so much that's 38% so throw all
[40:32] that out the window and you're left with
[40:34] 7% on Twitter and that's what that's
[40:37] actually like the scientific reason why
[40:39] there's so much miscommunication and
[40:42] nons and just yeah miscommunication on
[40:45] platforms like
[40:48] Twitter I like it a lot what you're
[40:50] saying because it's very true there's
[40:51] this really nice meme of of two dogs
[40:54] that are standing and there's a fence in
[40:56] between of them and they baring at each
[40:58] other and then the fence comes out and
[41:01] they they they're kind of like oh
[41:02] everything is fine
[41:05] like it's like uh Twitter versus real
[41:08] life it's I love that Meme a lot I think
[41:11] I posted it at least like 10 times
[41:12] already in my in my two years on Twitter
[41:16] because it shows the the community so
[41:19] well really cool um before uh we come
[41:22] closer to the end uh one more question
[41:25] what makes you so confident that we get
[41:28] to this Bitcoin World well I don't
[41:30] really know I don't I mean all I know is
[41:33] the all I know is what I see right now
[41:35] and for right now everything looks
[41:37] really good Bitcoin looks
[41:39] Unstoppable um we don't know what's
[41:42] going to happen I mean especially for
[41:44] instance this year 2024 today is
[41:46] September 3rd there's an election in two
[41:49] months supposedly people are saying the
[41:51] election's not even going to happen we
[41:53] got monkey pox rumors and and fomo or
[41:57] not fomo but
[42:00] fear no one's no one's afraid of missing
[42:03] out on monkey pux just to be clear uh
[42:05] but yeah so but like there's anyway the
[42:08] world we know the world is crazy and the
[42:10] crazy absolute Evil Lizard people who
[42:13] are in charge they're going to try
[42:15] everything in their power to stop
[42:17] Bitcoin and stop Freedom money and stop
[42:19] Noster and everything and we don't know
[42:20] the lengths they're going to go to so I
[42:24] don't know I don't I don't know where
[42:25] it's going but
[42:28] uh I also think there's going to be more
[42:31] privacy tools built maybe around Bitcoin
[42:34] maybe around nster I mean we already
[42:36] have amazing uh communication tools like
[42:39] simple x which runs on relays it's like
[42:42] a you know it's like WhatsApp or signal
[42:45] it's like one of those but it's way more
[42:48] uh private and it's also Unstoppable
[42:51] like Noster and like Bitcoin so I think
[42:53] there's going to be more of these things
[42:55] and there and so there will in my
[42:57] opinion there will always be like an
[42:59] underground of people who can transact
[43:02] not only in Bitcoin but also me you know
[43:05] use messaging and share content um sort
[43:08] of
[43:09] underground that's definitely always
[43:11] going to be there now how how what
[43:13] percentage of the world that is I don't
[43:16] know um but I just I'm always consoled
[43:20] by the fact uh of Bitcoin being
[43:23] Unstoppable you know it's been more than
[43:26] 15 years has never never been hacked
[43:27] it's never been taken
[43:29] over and you know you know people say oh
[43:33] well the NSA created bitcoin well I
[43:37] don't know maybe but probably not but it
[43:40] doesn't matter that's the whole point it
[43:42] doesn't matter they can't take it over
[43:45] can they no even if Satoshi is the NSA
[43:49] and they have 1.1 million Bitcoin what
[43:51] does that mean okay it means I guess
[43:53] they could sell everything and but what
[43:56] good does it do them so it's there's
[43:59] nothing and again maybe this is the
[44:01] hopium speaking right I just I just
[44:04] smoked quite a bit of hopium before this
[44:06] interview uh may maybe it's hopium I
[44:10] don't know but I am a hopeful person and
[44:11] like I said there's for me getting into
[44:13] Bitcoin there was sort of a mystical
[44:15] experience and and I know Max Kaiser
[44:17] also says Bitcoin is God and all like he
[44:20] saids stuff like that people think he's
[44:22] crazy you got to think about what he's
[44:24] saying he's saying it for a reason now I
[44:26] don't think Bitcoin is God and I don't
[44:28] think he thinks that either but there's
[44:31] a huge Transcendent element to bitcoin
[44:34] there really is and if you think about
[44:35] it you'll see it so I don't know where
[44:37] the future's going but I am uh very
[44:41] hopeful and and very confident that
[44:44] Bitcoin will be a big part of our future
[44:45] and and really be there to help the
[44:48] people what is simple act I never heard
[44:51] about that I just Googled it it looks
[44:53] interesting yeah so simple x it's like a
[44:54] me almost like a messenger app like a
[44:56] tech like a a like a like a WhatsApp or
[44:59] a signal it it's it's you can have you
[45:02] can do Communications one to one or you
[45:04] can do them you can have a group group
[45:06] message so it's just a messaging app you
[45:08] can also make calls on it you can call
[45:10] people but the way simple x works is
[45:13] very interesting it's like Noster it
[45:15] runs through
[45:16] relays so it's not centralized it
[45:19] there's no I mean there's a developer
[45:21] who developed the the app and then
[45:24] there's a bunch of relays of which I'm
[45:26] running one
[45:27] and you so and also uh with simple x
[45:31] there's no you don't have to put in a
[45:32] phone number or email or anything like
[45:35] literally nothing and it just works and
[45:37] so then that's it now people can message
[45:41] and uh that's it there's no it's it's
[45:44] complete privacy there's no there's no
[45:47] way anyone can get into see what you're
[45:49] doing right and there's no way people
[45:52] can stop it either like how can you stop
[45:54] that it's like Noster and it's like
[45:55] Bitcoin you can't stop
[45:57] it interesting I love it is it um but
[46:02] but are you connected to uh like if if
[46:05] I'm already on there uh and you are
[46:09] joining do you see me or can you see or
[46:11] join me or do we have to say be on the
[46:14] same relay or how does this work um no I
[46:16] think we would have to share one of us
[46:18] would have to share our uh I forget what
[46:20] it's called it's like the it's like an
[46:23] End pub it's like
[46:24] your your identifier what what is it
[46:27] called let me I have it right here I
[46:29] might as well open it up and
[46:34] see that
[46:36] in simple x it's called your simple x
[46:40] address and it's just you know a QR code
[46:44] and then a you can copy the address so I
[46:46] would copy my address and send it to you
[46:49] either you know however I send it to you
[46:51] email or whatever and then you would
[46:53] just click it and then we connect on
[46:54] simple x ah interesting thank you so
[46:57] much uh that looks interesting the only
[47:01] the only problem always is with uh the
[47:03] messaging app um like I already have
[47:08] let's say
[47:10] three ma three main messaging apps on my
[47:13] phone with WhatsApp Telegram and Signal
[47:17] uh and then uh most of my Bitcoin
[47:21] Community uh messaging I do on Twitter
[47:25] uh then people start texting me also on
[47:28] Nostra and also on Instagram and YouTube
[47:33] I don't get messages because they turn
[47:35] actually this down I think that's really
[47:37] good that they turn that down otherwise
[47:39] there would be another inbox uh yeah
[47:41] there all other U messaging uh apps that
[47:45] that are there so like it's a it's
[47:47] already a lot and I think the the
[47:50] network effect of those is interesting
[47:52] uh because even even telegram like
[47:55] WhatsApp has such an
[47:58] massive Network effect like I cannot get
[48:00] away from it because there are just
[48:02] people on there that will not switch
[48:04] like my grandma like my mom my dad like
[48:07] and it would be very hard to like say
[48:10] them hey please download that uh and I
[48:13] don't want to be that pain in the ass
[48:15] for for for for them that's the only
[48:17] thing that I'm like ah I I love the idea
[48:20] of like decentralizing and and really
[48:23] having extremely secure messaging uh and
[48:27] if for two parties that if if those are
[48:29] really
[48:30] important uh for for both of them then
[48:33] it makes totally sense but completely
[48:35] switching away from them it's just just
[48:37] so hard I know a friend of mine he he
[48:40] tries his sence like five years uh to
[48:42] get away from WhatsApp and he wants to
[48:44] do it with signal uh and he still didn't
[48:47] exceed because he's like there are
[48:49] people in my life that are important to
[48:52] me that don't switch from WhatsApp
[48:56] yeah I don't know if Americans can also
[48:59] have to because I think in America
[49:01] WhatsApp is not as common but in Europe
[49:06] WhatsApp like everyone is in WhatsApp
[49:08] like that's the app where everyone
[49:10] communicates with so I don't know you
[49:12] you're in America right yep I'm in
[49:15] America H how do you communicate is it
[49:18] uh also WhatsApp or like do you have
[49:20] other apps also yeah I think a lot of
[49:22] people use WhatsApp uh I think just
[49:24] regular text messaging honestly most
[49:27] most Americans just use regular text
[49:28] messaging what um oh yeah oh my God yeah
[49:33] people just like with family and stuff
[49:35] it's just texting most of my family is
[49:37] just texting they're not even on a
[49:39] app yeah and and I will I will under
[49:42] score your point about simple x because
[49:45] I found out about it and I'm like oh
[49:46] this is the greatest messenger and I got
[49:48] it and I there was no one to like
[49:49] connect to and so far after like a year
[49:52] it's only it's only like two people that
[49:54] I message on there so the network that
[49:57] that is very true what you're saying and
[49:59] uh and look hopefully in the long run we
[50:02] don't need things like simple x right it
[50:04] would be nice if these centralized
[50:07] platforms could just let people speak
[50:09] freely but and maybe they kind of are
[50:13] right now maybe now it's okay but again
[50:15] we don't know where it's going so we'll
[50:17] see how it plays out yeah it's it's
[50:20] interesting but how how can you still uh
[50:22] use normal text that's that's
[50:24] fascinating for me because like I think
[50:26] the laot the only text messages I
[50:29] receive is for two Factor
[50:31] authentification uh and if I get a scam
[50:35] like uh scams are still on text for for
[50:37] some reason because like if I get a scam
[50:39] if I get a text I know probably it's
[50:41] it's a scam uh so that like I only use
[50:45] like WhatsApp and all those things which
[50:48] is cool because I'm thinking of like I I
[50:51] could get rid of my phone number
[50:52] honestly I I I I I I don't need it
[50:55] really I phone with most of the people
[50:58] even on WhatsApp I don't even use the
[51:00] normal phone thing like most of the time
[51:02] I phone with with WhatsApp um which is
[51:05] probably not good but I think it's
[51:08] better actually than than using the
[51:10] normal because phones like SMS for
[51:13] example is not encrypted at all uh and
[51:16] and WhatsApp at least is encrypted but
[51:18] yeah Facebook will
[51:19] still still read it uh so that's that's
[51:23] interesting but yeah um I have one more
[51:26] thing that I teased before um I I
[51:30] thought I could bring it up today I I
[51:34] tried because I was also like you I was
[51:37] like I know Bitcoin
[51:39] will far exceed my expectations and far
[51:42] exceed most of the expectations so I was
[51:45] like but I want to get to a point where
[51:48] I know where Bitcoin goes because that's
[51:51] always the question I get from beginners
[51:53] I don't know if you also have that
[51:54] experience but when I talk with people
[51:56] people they always like yeah where's
[51:59] Bitcoin going and I'm like yeah up and
[52:01] they're
[52:02] like and I always wanted to have a good
[52:05] answer to that and I always want to have
[52:07] at least a solid argument a logical
[52:10] argument that I can follow that I can um
[52:13] subscribe to myself to like
[52:16] okay I I have the current situation I
[52:19] make some assumptions to the Future and
[52:22] if those assumptions are true then we go
[52:24] there like it's always like if if if and
[52:27] then we we come there you have to make a
[52:29] lot of assumptions so maybe you can
[52:31] follow my logic um chesse Myers the guy
[52:35] that makes that like 900 trillion um
[52:39] picture that also sailor uses a lot uh
[52:42] he says like there is 900 trillion
[52:45] Global wealth out there for for for
[52:49] Humanity uh and if you divide that just
[52:52] normally by 21 million B PDC that would
[52:56] be too easy like that that would be like
[52:59] oh like okay yeah then then we come to
[53:00] like 42 million US dollar per Bitcoin
[53:05] but there's this cavier where first of
[53:07] all not all um uh Bitcoin are available
[53:12] there are a lot of Bitcoin lost and then
[53:14] they have the second cavia Bitcoin will
[53:17] not vanish all value like there will
[53:20] still be value in real estate there will
[53:22] still be there private companies and
[53:24] equities uh there will be a lot of other
[53:27] things like uh watches will still have
[53:31] value uh gold will still have value
[53:33] other medals will still have value then
[53:35] it's like how much of the total thing
[53:39] can Bitcoin Capt and that's the that's
[53:41] the thing that I'm wrestling around and
[53:43] that's why I'm asking all my guests
[53:45] nowadays because that's like like I
[53:47] don't know I have no clue um and the
[53:50] most bullish scenario that I could think
[53:53] of like that's the bull bull bull case
[53:56] uh for me is 80 to 90% like if Bitcoin
[53:59] is actually like an amazing store of
[54:01] value uh and it's that money like
[54:04] everyone says like we are saving our
[54:07] money in Bitcoin 80 to 90% would be my
[54:11] guess because then um everyone would
[54:14] just stump everything they they don't
[54:17] have utility value uh so even gold would
[54:20] fall to bitcoin a lot because people
[54:22] would only use it for the utility value
[54:24] for maybe jewelry phones like it's in
[54:27] the phones and and other materials in
[54:28] electronics and stuff like that so when
[54:31] that happens uh and we assume that there
[54:34] are around 15 million uh Bitcoin uh then
[54:38] we are looking at like a 50 million uh
[54:42] bitcoin price Target which I'm like what
[54:45] in today's tll terms there's no
[54:47] inflation there there's nothing like
[54:48] that there which also means um two Sates
[54:52] would be $1 uh an interesting uh
[54:55] interesting
[54:57] thing that's uh my current bull bull
[55:00] bull case uh to just to open people's
[55:04] mind to the possibilities what Bitcoin
[55:06] can do for those people who ask me but
[55:10] is isn't it isn't it too late for for
[55:12] for Bitcoin then I'm like calculating
[55:15] that and then they're like oh yeah like
[55:18] it's a huge possibility but there are a
[55:21] lot of ifs uh along the way and I'm not
[55:24] saying Bitcoin will definitely hit like
[55:26] 50 million Mark uh eventually probably
[55:29] it will because fat will I think will
[55:31] die off so for so a few questions I have
[55:34] for you now you have heard that for the
[55:36] first time here I guess uh what's your
[55:39] thoughts and also do you think Fiat will
[55:43] die because I just brought that up and I
[55:44] think some Bitcoin actually don't think
[55:47] that fat will die um what are your
[55:49] thoughts uh again as a
[55:51] non-economist I I don't think Fiat will
[55:54] die I think Fiat will just continually
[55:57] get more and more destroyed and I think
[56:00] we're all going to hold our Bitcoin and
[56:01] we're going to borrow against it and
[56:03] that's how we're going to do things in
[56:04] the real world um that's one of the main
[56:07] ways that I feel will do things in the m
[56:10] in the real world um yeah as far as the
[56:13] number and the future again I don't know
[56:16] I I your uh bull bull bull case sounds
[56:20] good to
[56:21] me I
[56:23] think as Michael sailor said to Laura
[56:26] shin it's going up forever Laura like
[56:29] and by the way I by that time I had left
[56:31] as her producer so I I there was a
[56:34] chance in the world that I could have
[56:36] been on that session when he said that
[56:39] uh but I wasn't anyway uh would would
[56:42] have been my new next question yeah but
[56:46] uh so but but I really do think it's
[56:49] it's G to go up forever uh because just
[56:52] because of supply and demand that's all
[56:54] you know I I think for just normal
[56:56] people to understand the long-term price
[56:59] action of Bitcoin supply and demand is
[57:02] all you have to understand like there's
[57:03] no it's it it is that simple in my
[57:06] opinion uh yeah and the other thing
[57:09] is especially during our life times
[57:12] because look even if you're born today
[57:14] you're probably going to die around
[57:17] 2100 let's say you you'd be 80 or
[57:21] something and bitcoin's going to
[57:23] continue to be mined until around 21 40
[57:27] so I think especially in our
[57:29] lifetimes it's it is just going to keep
[57:32] going up and it's going to be that store
[57:33] of value that Michael sailor talks about
[57:36] it is everything else is going to bleed
[57:38] and just melt and bitcoin's the only
[57:41] thing not only is it going to hold its
[57:43] value but it's going to go way up in
[57:45] value so and so for me that's enough I
[57:49] you know I don't need I don't need
[57:53] numbers I don't need $50 million per
[57:55] Bitcoin of of course I talk about
[57:57] numbers all the time especially on my
[57:59] you know I put out a video every day and
[58:01] I me we me we talk about numbers because
[58:03] what else you going to talk about every
[58:04] day I mean you got to talk about
[58:06] something um we talk about a lot of news
[58:08] too but um my point is that overall I
[58:12] think we're just going to keep going up
[58:13] and and as far as talking to new people
[58:16] who ask about numbers like oh what is it
[58:18] going to go up
[58:19] to I think at that point it's really
[58:22] important to have this kind of
[58:24] conversation with them the fact that
[58:26] number one we don't know number
[58:29] two uh it's all it's just all about
[58:32] supply and demand number three Bitcoin
[58:34] is just going to keep going up because
[58:35] that's how Bitcoin Works number four
[58:37] it's the it's the greatest store of
[58:39] value ever if everything keeps working
[58:41] out the way it's working out so those
[58:44] are the those are the like the
[58:45] fundamental important things to me and
[58:48] so the number I mean I'm like I said I'm
[58:50] happy to talk about numbers and throw
[58:51] out big numbers because I hope they
[58:54] happen uh you know because want I want a
[58:57] huge Retreat Center somewhere on a lot
[58:59] of land and I want to have meditation
[59:02] Retreats and I want to have a bunch of
[59:05] you know cabins throughout the the
[59:08] through throughout the forest where
[59:10] people can come and spend two weeks on a
[59:12] Meditation Retreat and really just
[59:13] unplug from the world maybe read some
[59:16] classic texts spiritual texts like the
[59:19] babad Gita and the TA ching and
[59:22] everything and so uh that's what I'm
[59:25] hoping for and I hope I hope my Bitcoin
[59:29] stack will will uh is big enough that I
[59:31] can borrow against it to to buy that uh
[59:34] land and build a retreat center but um
[59:37] we'll see but I'm
[59:39] hopeful uh I I love your um I love your
[59:44] take on it like your approach to to that
[59:47] conversation really cool um as you do a
[59:49] lot of news what's the uh what what do
[59:52] you see currently interesting in in the
[59:54] news like when you see all the news you
[59:56] kind of get a a a feeling on what's
[59:58] currently in the news bit in the bitcoin
[60:01] news cycle uh what what what do you see
[60:03] there well actually I've been on
[60:04] vacation for about a week and a half and
[60:06] today is like my first day back so a
[60:08] after we talk I'm I'm going to actually
[60:11] make my first video after vacation after
[60:13] a week and a half so I haven't been
[60:15] paying close attention to the news but
[60:17] from what well first of all in terms of
[60:19] the Bitcoin cycle pretty much within a
[60:22] month like October November we should
[60:24] start go going up for real at some point
[60:28] we'll start going up we'll pass our
[60:30] all-time high start going to 100K area
[60:33] and whatever um next year is obviously
[60:36] The Big Year the big peak year so that's
[60:39] that uh but also apparently the FED in
[60:42] the US is about to cut rates and so that
[60:45] might start this this chain reaction of
[60:49] uh of cutting rates and then more US
[60:52] Dollars entering the system and and
[60:55] again I'm not a technical guy but
[60:56] apparently what was it for well during
[60:59] covid right didn't isn't covid when they
[61:01] just they basically put all the rates
[61:03] down to zero or something uh and so then
[61:06] you know all the economies could
[61:08] flourish so apparently that's what that
[61:11] means when they drop rates the economy
[61:12] is going to be able to flourish more and
[61:14] then those are the times when Bitcoin
[61:16] also flourishes a lot so uh I think
[61:18] that's a that's a macro thing that's I I
[61:22] think is going to be impactful um and
[61:25] and yeah that besides that I haven't
[61:26] followed any smaller news I mean for me
[61:29] every day it's just it's always about
[61:30] adoption and building it's it's it's
[61:33] it's there's a new bank that is starting
[61:37] to offer Bitcoin to their to their
[61:40] customers there's a new uh investment
[61:42] firm that is now offering the Bitcoin as
[61:45] a spot ETF there's a country that is
[61:48] allowing Bitcoin mining like there's
[61:50] just every day it's adoption adoption
[61:52] adoption it's wonderful to see so uh
[61:54] let's go I'm ready for this Bull Run
[61:56] it's been a long boring summer for my
[61:58] channel it's hard to get on there every
[62:00] day and talk about nothing happening in
[62:03] terms of price I mean we need a little
[62:05] Movement we need a little just get to a
[62:08] new all-time high even if you come back
[62:10] down God we all need just a little
[62:12] energy from the price but
[62:16] anyway little more hope we need I love
[62:19] it a lot um let's come to the end of of
[62:21] the podcast um one question to ask all
[62:24] my guests what can we learn learn from
[62:26] you besides all the things that we
[62:28] already talked about well I just want to
[62:30] say that I have and I'll I'll speak to
[62:33] you the viewer directly I have faith in
[62:36] you I know you
[62:39] can what whatever is happening your in
[62:41] your life right now if it's some bad
[62:43] things you want to get away from I have
[62:45] faith that you can transcend that and
[62:47] move move away and you have goals and
[62:51] aspirations I have faith that you can
[62:53] move toward those goals and achieve your
[62:55] goals I really do this is The Human
[62:58] Condition and it it it comes down to you
[63:02] and so I just want to say that I have
[63:03] faith in you to move forward and move up
[63:07] and
[63:08] really thrust your life into so into a
[63:11] place where you didn't you didn't even
[63:12] know it could be and part of that is
[63:15] dropping all your baggage just drop all
[63:17] your baggage all your emotional baggage
[63:20] everything and it's astounding what we
[63:23] as humans can achieve and
[63:26] uh and so I have faith in you that's
[63:30] that's I don't know if that's something
[63:32] you can learn from me but that's
[63:33] something I just wanted to say that's
[63:35] beautiful I love that a lot uh now we we
[63:38] talked about faith in something uh now
[63:41] the end routine is where we have uh the
[63:44] previous guest asking a question for the
[63:46] next guest without knowing who the next
[63:47] guest is uh and the the question is what
[63:51] can cause Bitcoin to fail wow there's
[63:53] there's probably a million things uh I
[63:56] would assume there's a million things um
[63:59] maybe not a million but many things I
[64:01] don't know I mean well people talk about
[64:04] a meteor hitting the Earth or something
[64:06] all the electricity going away that
[64:08] would that would at least kill Bitcoin
[64:11] in the in the short
[64:13] term um also
[64:17] if uh if there's a government or a
[64:20] global entity that becomes so
[64:22] authoritarian that they literally just
[64:25] start taking over the world and and they
[64:27] say that bitcoin's illegal and no one
[64:29] can use it and they start confiscating
[64:31] it that's for sure that's a possibility
[64:35] um and especially that starting in
[64:38] Europe because you guys in Europe have
[64:41] no
[64:42] guns like like at least in the US the US
[64:46] can't do that literally the US can't say
[64:49] you can't do this you you bitcoin's
[64:52] illegal you can't do it they can't say
[64:54] that because if they try to come door to
[64:55] door there's not enough of them to come
[64:57] door too they're all going to get shot
[65:00] so that's that but in Europe you guys
[65:03] are anyway it's more possible in Europe
[65:07] um what else maybe Satoshi comes back
[65:09] and starts leveraging his 1.1 million
[65:11] Bitcoin in a bad way I don't
[65:14] know uh maybe maybe someone does find
[65:16] out how to hack Bitcoin maybe that's
[65:18] another one uh maybe someone actually
[65:22] hacks it and destroys it or just takes
[65:24] it all right and
[65:26] I don't know um yeah those are those are
[65:28] a few things off the top of my head
[65:29] really cool I think I think we should
[65:32] focus more on not focus more but we
[65:34] should be more aware of what can kind
[65:38] happen to bitcoin because if we know
[65:41] that better we also know Bitcoin better
[65:44] and our faith in Bitcoin will also be
[65:46] then better so I think that there's a
[65:49] lot of um it's a funny story um how I
[65:53] got into Bitcoin I was 100% of the
[65:57] opinion that Bitcoin is a scam for three
[65:59] years straight and that friend
[66:01] challenged me and asked questions about
[66:03] that he was not even a bitcoiner he was
[66:04] not a bitcoiner he was just asking me
[66:06] questions about it and I was discovering
[66:09] that I don't have enough arguments so I
[66:11] really wanted to have the pursuit of why
[66:14] Bitcoin is a scam and wanted to make
[66:17] that argument and in pursuit of that
[66:20] argument making I discovered Bitcoin
[66:23] because I was open to the idea of bitco
[66:25] Co I really discovered it so I think
[66:28] even as a Bitcoin in that Bitcoin bubble
[66:31] we have to always always keep learning
[66:35] about the negative things about Bitcoin
[66:36] about other things than Bitcoin and have
[66:38] those
[66:39] conversations uh otherwise we will be in
[66:43] an echo chamber and the bad thing about
[66:44] an echo chamber is you get blind spots
[66:47] uh and that's what uh I think is the
[66:50] real um danger to bitcoin that Bitcoin
[66:54] and the Bitcoin Comm Community is
[66:56] growing a blind spot uh where there it
[67:00] it might not need to be a blind spot so
[67:02] I think that's that's that's one thing
[67:04] that I try to to bring up in those
[67:07] conversations but yeah it has been a
[67:08] pleasure uh talking uh with You Chris it
[67:11] was really really cool uh thank you so
[67:13] much for being on before I let you go
[67:15] where can people find you where can
[67:17] people read and watch your stuff yeah
[67:19] fractal bitcoin.com that's the website
[67:22] that's the show on YouTube it's it's
[67:25] catching on most on YouTube but I do put
[67:26] it on Rumble and I was putting it on
[67:29] flare on which is on Noster it's a
[67:31] Noster app uh but anyway I that's
[67:34] there's an issue with that the developer
[67:36] working on so yeah fractal bitcoin.com
[67:39] my my every time you start a video on
[67:42] YouTube I say oh yeah fractal Bitcoin
[67:45] that's my little opening tag so it's
[67:48] it's kind of fun and I play a sound clip
[67:49] too of this this guy it's a sound clip
[67:52] of this guy Barry who's my producer uh
[67:54] he's got a really deep voice it's really
[67:56] fun so fractal bitcoin.com
[67:58] I love it the end scene I watched it the
[68:02] day before the podcast and I was like a
[68:04] nice and I was not even I thought that
[68:06] probably some uh um famous meme or
[68:09] something that you that you play but
[68:10] it's your producer and he has a really
[68:12] nice voice yeah but he's really not my
[68:15] producer he's actually I quick story I
[68:18] had a podcast studio in New Jersey from
[68:21] 2012 to 2015 a physical podcast Studio
[68:25] this is before this is early days
[68:27] podcasting so or medium days podcasting
[68:30] and anyway the maintenance guy in the
[68:31] building was this guy Barry this this
[68:34] big black guy he was a he was in the
[68:36] Navy he was a seaman and he had this
[68:38] voice and he would come in he was an
[68:40] older gentleman and he would come in and
[68:43] he would sort of sit in my studio just
[68:45] sort of to take a break he would sit so
[68:47] no one could see him and he would just
[68:49] start talking and I slowly his voice was
[68:51] so amazing I'm like Barry so I just put
[68:54] up a mic in front of him and I would
[68:55] just move it a little closer few minutes
[68:58] later move it closer and I him and I
[68:59] just talked and I let him talk and all
[69:02] the all the quotes I play on my show are
[69:05] clips from the audio of him just hanging
[69:08] out talking in my studio so anyway now I
[69:10] have those clips which are amazing and I
[69:12] I pretend on my show that he's my
[69:14] producer and I ask him questions and
[69:16] it's it's fun it's a fun little thing
[69:18] and and uh yeah H I love that really
