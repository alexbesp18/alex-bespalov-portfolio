[00:00] you have millions of options of what you
[00:02] can do but many of those options can get
[00:04] you killed or get you hurt it's not just
[00:06] about having options it's about finding
[00:08] the best option Bitcoin has ultimately
[00:11] established itself as the best
[00:13] investment option Bitcoin is going to go
[00:15] much higher from a value perspective I
[00:18] believe it it will ultimately be in the
[00:20] millions of dollars show me exactly how
[00:22] much gold is out there right now please
[00:25] now show me how much gold is under the
[00:27] ground right now please show me you know
[00:30] you can't it's going to be a way better
[00:33] asset for the banks to custody than than
[00:35] real estate you know to give loans
[00:37] against it you're holding Pure Energy
[00:39] pure economic power as opposed to now
[00:42] having the right to a certain home if
[00:43] they don't pay their mortgage or
[00:45] something like it's a no-brainer look at
[00:47] it like a living organism and and you
[00:49] realize it can't be killed this is a a
[00:51] very very strong organism that is is
[00:54] growing over time getting stronger over
[00:56] time it's growing in value over time it
[00:58] just can't be stopped at this
[01:01] [Music]
[01:06] you are actually my second UFC fight
[01:09] after renat moano that was he was
[01:12] recently on yeah that's awesome man it's
[01:15] so great to hear uh hanato be so
[01:18] passionate about Bitcoin and uh you know
[01:22] governmental policies and and and uh and
[01:25] you know I guess politics in general and
[01:27] um you know the the situation with
[01:29] monetary policy I it it it's awesome um
[01:32] it's great to see him so passionate
[01:33] about it and sharing that information
[01:35] and and to see him do well uh he's doing
[01:37] great in his career and uh I really like
[01:39] kinato yeah H really cool and uh you you
[01:44] are uh former UFC fighters you're not no
[01:47] longer fighting and uh I also I think he
[01:53] was also in law school before did you
[01:55] and I heard you are also in law school
[01:57] before is is that is that connection
[01:59] with likew um not necessarily in law
[02:01] school I I was I was pre-law I was part
[02:03] of a pre-law program when I graduated
[02:05] from Boston College and and the idea was
[02:08] to go on to law school after I graduated
[02:11] um you know the plans changed I ended up
[02:15] not doing that but um yeah okay so like
[02:18] you were on the road of getting into law
[02:21] school and then you changed to fighting
[02:24] basically exactly yeah interesting yeah
[02:28] I love it uh just before we get into the
[02:31] Bitcoin stuff why did you change into
[02:35] fighting and and was that already for
[02:37] you like I I want to pursue that passion
[02:40] or was that something because you were
[02:41] so good in it and you kind of wanted to
[02:44] to do it and you already got money for
[02:45] that or like what was the process there
[02:47] yeah yeah good question you know um for
[02:50] me I think I was probably not probably I
[02:53] think I was more following a path that
[02:56] maybe my parents wanted for me right uh
[02:59] my my father was a physician um and
[03:03] maybe he wanted a lawyer in the family
[03:04] or something but you know the idea was
[03:06] okay you know you go to Boston College
[03:08] you graduate you go on to law school you
[03:11] know and get into that practice um and
[03:15] to me I I just wasn't as passionate
[03:17] about it and and I even when I you know
[03:20] wanted to go full-time into martial arts
[03:23] I had no idea at the time that I would
[03:25] actually be a professional fighter my
[03:27] plan was just to kind of study martial
[03:29] arts and end up teaching it um but I so
[03:32] I didn't really have a plan of fighting
[03:34] I didn't have this organized plan
[03:35] necessarily I just knew that if I could
[03:38] get up every day and train martial arts
[03:41] that I would be a happy guy and and um
[03:44] and it ended up you know leading towards
[03:47] um you know fighting and and opening up
[03:49] other schools and and and gave me a lot
[03:51] of other
[03:51] opportunities um so yeah it was yeah
[03:54] pretty interesting oh nice so you opened
[03:57] all those schools up uh and and not only
[04:00] doing the fighting but also opening
[04:02] schools up for for other people to to
[04:04] train you uh martial arts yes yes really
[04:08] interesting I love that um now to
[04:10] bitcoin how did uh when did Bitcoin come
[04:12] around for you like how did you get into
[04:14] Bitcoin and discover that yeah so I I
[04:17] think it was around maybe
[04:21] 2014 or so 2013 maybe um I do remember
[04:25] the price of Bitcoin I don't remember
[04:27] the the year necessarily but I remember
[04:29] uh Bitcoin had gone down to like the $70
[04:32] range in and there in and around there
[04:35] and um a buddy of mine in Los Angeles
[04:37] was telling me about it where I was
[04:38] living at the time and he said you know
[04:41] I really think you'd be interested in
[04:42] this technology um this thing Bitcoin
[04:45] just went down you should buy some now
[04:47] that it's pretty cheap and you know he
[04:49] explained it to me you know some kind of
[04:51] rough explanation of what Bitcoin is um
[04:54] and I was like okay trying to wrap my
[04:56] head around it and then you know I I
[04:59] kind of left uh you know I think we were
[05:00] having lunch at the time and I kind of
[05:02] left the the meeting or or the the lunch
[05:04] thinking well clearly the government is
[05:06] going to be able to shut this down you
[05:08] know I I didn't really know what it was
[05:10] so much and and you know kind of rote it
[05:12] off and it wasn't until much later that
[05:15] I really started looking into it um and
[05:18] of course the price had gone up a a lot
[05:20] more um but uh yeah so I think I I first
[05:24] purchased Bitcoin in
[05:26] 2016 and then I I really tell people I
[05:29] was a true bitcoiner in 20177 when I
[05:32] kind of went all in in in
[05:35] 2017 as opposed to kind of seeing all
[05:37] these different digital assets as like
[05:38] similar things or all like kind of do
[05:40] different things and you know when I
[05:42] realized okay well Bitcoin is the more
[05:44] expensive thing for a reason and as I
[05:46] was kind of understanding more about it
[05:49] um went in all went all in on bitcoin
[05:51] and um of course still didn't understand
[05:54] it fully at that point and and I'm not
[05:55] sure I do uh even today as much I'm
[05:57] always learning more and more every
[05:59] single day and I try to educate myself
[06:02] as much as possible and bitcoin's been
[06:04] such a fascinating journey of you know
[06:06] continual learning and and and
[06:09] evolution absolutely I think nobody
[06:11] fully understands Bitcoin um but uh
[06:14] there are people closer to the 100% than
[06:17] others that right but yeah that's that's
[06:21] amazing like being all in Bitcoin so so
[06:24] like you you dismissed the the altcoins
[06:28] rightfully so uh uh but you probably
[06:30] still have other Investments or did you
[06:32] completely went all in in Bitcoin so I
[06:35] would say the only other thing that I
[06:36] have is real estate um you know so
[06:40] owning a home and and and that's pretty
[06:42] much it but uh yeah everything else is
[06:44] you know Bitcoin yeah yeah I wouldn't
[06:47] count a home as an investment I know
[06:49] it's it's considered an investment in
[06:51] traditional Finance but I I wouldn't
[06:53] like that's an expense that you pay for
[06:57] to have a home for your family sure I
[06:59] wouldn't even even count that it's
[07:01] really interesting um how do you look as
[07:05] as as from the the being really
[07:08] passionate about martial arts about uh
[07:10] fighting in the UFC uh how does how did
[07:13] that influence the way you look at
[07:16] Bitcoin yeah gosh you know I guess it
[07:18] it's always constantly evolving but um
[07:22] you know I I tend to look at a lot of
[07:23] things in terms of Defense you know how
[07:26] do I protect myself um that's kind of
[07:29] how I got into martial arts was I you
[07:31] know I wasn't the biggest guy I wanted
[07:33] to learn how to defend myself um getting
[07:36] into a flight was a scary thing for me
[07:38] initially and it it's only when you kind
[07:41] of realize the impact of what that has
[07:43] on you um you know violence or someone
[07:46] who decides to attack you that you
[07:47] realize for many people that oh wow I
[07:50] probably should know I I should probably
[07:51] try to learn how to defend myself um and
[07:53] I think the similar thing is with money
[07:56] um or Investments um when you start to
[08:00] see that okay well there's a lot of
[08:03] vulnerabilities here with your money and
[08:05] with it being valued less uh over time
[08:09] and with the certainty that it will be
[08:11] less with time you start to think well
[08:14] how do I protect myself um and then you
[08:17] start to look into okay well do I buy
[08:20] stocks and ETFs or you know do I buy a
[08:24] business or um you know do I buy gold or
[08:27] do I buy real estate and you start
[08:29] looking at all the different real estate
[08:31] uh you start all the other investment
[08:33] options you start to go well they're
[08:34] kind of like weapons in a way um you
[08:37] know uh what are the different weapons
[08:39] that I can utilize and what are the most
[08:41] ver versatile and what are the most
[08:44] effective ones and and this is kind of
[08:46] what you're considering when you're
[08:47] training for a fight is you're you know
[08:50] looking at all these weapons you're
[08:52] you're looking at of course the
[08:53] principles and trying to understand why
[08:56] it works and how it's going to work um
[08:59] and and you start to implement them into
[09:01] your game and you kind of stress test
[09:03] them until they are a part of you and
[09:05] then you can use them and and I think
[09:07] that when you compare all the different
[09:09] Investments that are out there I think
[09:12] not only is is Bitcoin you know proven
[09:14] to be the most successful investment as
[09:16] far as growth um but I think it's also
[09:20] something that is um the least
[09:22] vulnerable to attack or the least
[09:25] vulnerable many times to it um being
[09:29] completely you know and I think that
[09:31] that's you know how I tried to structure
[09:34] an approach to a fight well it's like
[09:37] you have millions of options of what you
[09:39] can do but many of those options can get
[09:42] you killed or get you hurt so you know
[09:44] it's not just about having options it's
[09:46] about finding the best options and for
[09:48] me Bitcoin has ultimately um established
[09:52] itself as the best investment option
[09:55] it's kind of the the a financial
[09:57] Financial weapon uh you describe it like
[10:00] you have different weapons you have
[10:02] different instruments that you can use
[10:04] and and Bitcoin is clearly it's like
[10:06] it's like bringing a knife
[10:08] to um bring KN right right yeah exactly
[10:14] 100% And also multi-layered Robin you
[10:17] know like can you think about it in
[10:19] terms of like um you know geopolitical
[10:22] implications um uh you know for the
[10:25] regular pleb uh who's out there like it
[10:27] it is a solution
[10:29] um that kind of has this multi-pronged
[10:32] effect or uh it's kind of like a
[10:34] multi-pronged weapon like a Swiss army
[10:36] knife for example um to use to use that
[10:39] analogy so um whereas you know monetary
[10:42] policy in general you know for a um you
[10:45] know most uh governments or people that
[10:48] are implementing this it's it's a it's a
[10:50] blunt instrument and a lot of times when
[10:52] you make these decisions um with
[10:55] monetary policy you have these
[10:57] unfortunate second and third order
[10:59] effects that you know ends up affecting
[11:02] a lot of people in a negative way and
[11:04] and um you know Bitcoin ends up becoming
[11:07] this kind of Swiss Army nice solution to
[11:10] to a lot of different things on on
[11:13] varying
[11:14] levels I love that yeah that's really
[11:16] really good um I heard you also talking
[11:19] on another podcast I forgot which one uh
[11:22] uh comparing Bitcoin kind of to being an
[11:25] underdog as with your own story of like
[11:28] why to learn because you were like the
[11:30] the underdog and you wanted to defend
[11:32] yourself is do you see Bitcoin still as
[11:35] the underdog like is that like we we're
[11:38] still very early and and it's kind of
[11:40] fighting the the big feat systems no
[11:43] question I I definitely see it that way
[11:45] you know I I believe of course that that
[11:48] Bitcoin is going to go much higher um
[11:51] from a value perspective I believe it it
[11:53] will ultimately um be in the millions of
[11:56] dollars um so it's sitting right now at
[11:59] around
[12:01] $98,000 um that we're recording this I I
[12:03] think there's a lot more to go and
[12:05] people are still kind of underestimating
[12:08] its impact uh as an investment as a tool
[12:11] for uh Freedom um as a tool to solve a
[12:16] lot of different things um you know
[12:18] whether you're looking at maybe like the
[12:19] triffin Dilemma or something like that
[12:21] um you know I I think I think it's
[12:23] something that um not as many people are
[12:27] considering um and I I also think like
[12:31] uh you know the the way that it has
[12:34] grown um you know a lot of people make
[12:37] that antifragile uh comparison and I
[12:39] think that it's it's very appropriate
[12:41] because you know as you're coming up
[12:43] let's say in in the fight game for
[12:46] example you need
[12:48] to uh experience hardship in order to
[12:51] grow I I can't know what I'm vulnerable
[12:54] to until I actually experience it so
[12:57] fighting involves a lot of falling on
[12:58] your face it involves a lot of hardship
[13:00] it involves a lot of failure uh quote
[13:03] unquote uh for you to grow um and
[13:06] similar to let's say lifting weights or
[13:08] doing exercise where you have this
[13:10] soreness period um you know that's what
[13:13] allows your muscles to grow that's what
[13:15] allows your heart to get stronger that's
[13:17] what allows your mind to get stronger um
[13:20] and it happens at varying levels and in
[13:22] varying ways um and it expands slowly
[13:26] over time that's what I think real
[13:28] growth is is um I think anytime you get
[13:31] these
[13:32] explosive
[13:34] um uh times of growth a lot of times it
[13:37] goes up fast but it can also go down
[13:39] really quickly as well so I think this
[13:42] this period since 2009 that Bitcoin was
[13:44] released um you know it was really
[13:48] important for Bitcoin to actually grow
[13:50] slowly and and I think it's very similar
[13:52] to you know a lot of people um uh have
[13:56] compared it to uh melium or plant life
[13:59] or you know the the bamboo roots that
[14:01] grows underground and it spreads itself
[14:03] out first strengthening the roots and
[14:06] then all of a sudden before you know it
[14:07] it spreads out everywhere and for people
[14:10] that are trying to kill Bitcoin or get
[14:12] rid of it um you know once it starts
[14:15] sprouting it's very hard to put it out
[14:17] because it has spread itself everywhere
[14:20] um so I think that that slow growth is
[14:22] is really become its strength um and and
[14:25] again all the hardships that it's
[14:27] encountered has only strengthened it
[14:29] um so it it's it really is a fascinating
[14:33] thing um that uh you know if you were to
[14:37] looking look at it like a living
[14:39] organism
[14:41] um and and you realize it can't be
[14:43] killed U this this is a a very very
[14:47] strong organism that is is growing over
[14:49] time getting stronger over time it's
[14:51] growing in value over time and um and it
[14:55] just can't be stopped at this point I
[14:58] love the analogy with with like hardship
[15:01] uh where you get strong with hardship um
[15:04] because I think a lot of the people that
[15:07] are now coming in they can look back at
[15:10] a history uh where Bitcoin is constantly
[15:14] being attacked U being it from 2017 with
[15:18] the block siiz wars being like 2021
[15:22] where El musk came in uh and like bought
[15:25] it it went up and then he he said some
[15:28] like environment think that could be
[15:30] considered an attack uh and so many more
[15:34] instances where people try to attack it
[15:36] I mean China since like forever they're
[15:39] trying to mine to ban the mining and
[15:41] everything like that and it's just
[15:44] because of those attacks that we know
[15:46] how strong it is if never has been
[15:49] attacked we wouldn't know if it's
[15:52] actually that stable because nobody ever
[15:54] tried to attack it and the attacks make
[15:57] it actually that strong asset where we
[16:00] can point towards in the history like it
[16:02] has been tried like this has already
[16:04] been happening that's fascinating 100%
[16:07] And it's similar to how I got into the
[16:10] it's similar to how I got involved in
[16:12] the martial arts uh when I saw this
[16:14] thing called Brazilian jiu-jitsu and I
[16:16] saw you know um this Brazilian guy named
[16:20] hoist Gracie who was really thin really
[16:22] a small guy and was defeating all these
[16:24] guys in real fights that's where I could
[16:27] say okay well it is proved itself to be
[16:30] strong it is not you know martial arts
[16:32] prior to that was largely based on the
[16:35] you know theories um you know there were
[16:38] these uh you know theoretical statements
[16:40] of well if you decided to punch me I
[16:43] would just kick you here and I would you
[16:45] know just uh avoid here or block and do
[16:48] this or grab your wrist and this but
[16:49] none of it was proven it was all really
[16:51] theory that you trained in the dojo but
[16:53] you didn't really know whether it would
[16:55] work or not but when you have mixed
[16:57] martial arts fighting you could see
[16:59] which techniques were effective and
[17:01] which weren't and you could see the
[17:02] evolution of it and and um yeah Bitcoin
[17:06] has proved itself to be immune to so
[17:08] many different things and and and if it
[17:10] was vulnerable to some things it would
[17:12] only come back stronger just like a
[17:13] living organism like when you get sick
[17:15] and your immune system is now stronger
[17:17] because of it and now that thing that
[17:19] got you sick before is no longer an
[17:21] issue so it's it really has been a a
[17:23] fascinating Journey for me in learning
[17:25] about Bitcoin and how similar it is to
[17:28] um you know I guess it it's a protocol
[17:31] of course for for money and preservation
[17:33] of money but um it's very similar to the
[17:35] fight game in a lot of ways
[17:38] interesting maybe that's a stupid
[17:40] question but I still will ask it um if
[17:43] Bitcoin would be martial arts style what
[17:46] martial art style would it be Brazilian
[17:48] chitsu or it's it's a great question
[17:50] actually you know so I I've actually
[17:53] thought about this a lot and and I do
[17:55] think um it is very similar to an elite
[17:59] Grappler like a truly worldclass
[18:01] Grappler um you know I I think it
[18:06] is versatile against all other styles it
[18:10] is extremely
[18:11] efficient um it is extremely strong it
[18:15] only gets stronger over time um so it
[18:19] almost has this quality of that
[18:20] Superhero Wolverine where you can't kill
[18:23] it it only gets stronger you know a
[18:26] similar even maybe to The Incredible
[18:27] Hulk as well the more that you attack it
[18:30] the you know the bigger and angrier it
[18:32] gets the stronger it gets um so yeah it
[18:35] it is um I I guess I would I would
[18:39] equate it a lot to Brazilian Jitsu it's
[18:41] very sophisticated even though it may
[18:43] not look like it is um it it is rooted
[18:47] in in extremely strong truth these
[18:50] principles that spread itself across a
[18:53] lot of different ways it is linked to
[18:55] physics just like grappling um and and
[18:58] you know a lot of people foolishly think
[19:00] in grappling that what you're chasing
[19:01] are you know a collection of techniques
[19:04] but in reality what you're doing is
[19:06] you're chasing uh physics you're chasing
[19:08] truth you're chasing what is correct uh
[19:11] leverage um you know understanding how
[19:14] to get underneath someone's Center of
[19:15] mass um you know control of the fulcrum
[19:18] and lever you know so these are these
[19:20] are scientific principles that that are
[19:23] unchanging and and Bitcoin is very much
[19:26] um you know similar to that
[19:29] yeah it's like tied to physics and and
[19:31] and Mathematics it's really you you
[19:33] mentioned something that I didn't uh
[19:35] fully hear remember like trib dilemma or
[19:38] something like that Tri yeah Tri dilemma
[19:42] what is that yeah so the triin Dilemma
[19:44] is is basically um and I got I don't
[19:46] pretend to be an expert on you know
[19:48] monetary policy or Global Reserve
[19:50] currency but from my understanding um
[19:53] you know triffin dilemma is when you
[19:56] have the global Reserve currency like
[19:59] the United States they have the dollar
[20:01] it's the strongest currency out there um
[20:04] it leads to a lot of other issues um
[20:07] right so let's say uh because your
[20:10] dollar is so strong you now need to uh
[20:14] export a lot of uh the production so
[20:16] basically instead of having having
[20:18] domestic production you now need to send
[20:20] it off to say China for example which
[20:23] now everybody is sending um you know a
[20:25] lot of their industrial production uh to
[20:28] China so now you are potentially sending
[20:31] off a lot of this um production to
[20:35] rivals or or potential Rivals and now
[20:38] strengthening their economies right so
[20:41] um you know so I think that and those of
[20:43] course have other geopolitical issues
[20:45] and and even domestic issues so now
[20:47] let's say okay you you could do it you
[20:50] could produce Goods um cheaper in China
[20:54] well now that means that a lot of the
[20:56] let's say a factory in the United States
[20:58] now now needs to be shut down so now all
[21:01] those people lost their jobs um and now
[21:04] you're creating a certain amount of uh
[21:06] Financial depression you're creating
[21:09] mental depression so now there's a lack
[21:11] of mental health and now because of that
[21:13] you're leading to potential alcohol and
[21:16] drug abuse um and you know and now that
[21:19] is all because you can do it cheaper in
[21:22] another country and now you just
[21:24] strengthened another country's economy
[21:25] because of it so like so the United
[21:29] States is kind of in that issue and
[21:31] especially now that China has basically
[21:34] stopped uh buying us
[21:36] treasuries um you know that has actually
[21:39] come to kind of bite Us in the ass a
[21:40] little bit uh where now they're no
[21:42] longer buying as many treasuries as they
[21:44] had it was like over a trillion dollars
[21:46] now it's like around 700 billion or
[21:48] something like that I think the the
[21:49] biggest owner of of us treasuries right
[21:51] now at the moment I think is Japan but
[21:54] you know so we're in this issue and and
[21:55] you know of course we have kind of
[21:56] stable coins that are kind of picking up
[21:58] the slack you know like like tether and
[22:00] things like that but um you know it's
[22:04] it's been kind of fascinating to see how
[22:06] it all has been playing out so um I I
[22:10] think that Bitcoin kind of can serve as
[22:13] a little bit of a solution to that or
[22:14] maybe a lot of bit of a solution uh to
[22:17] that by putting your money into an asset
[22:20] that's going to grow over time uh and
[22:23] you know of course I I would I would
[22:24] lean toward it being a much better
[22:26] solution for you know people all over
[22:28] the the world you know the regular pleb
[22:30] um but it also can be a solution to a
[22:33] lot of the issues that governments are
[22:34] experiencing all over the world as well
[22:37] and we seeing uh I'm fascinated by that
[22:40] we already see that happening like
[22:43] nation states coming and playing with
[22:45] Bitcoin that that that that surprised me
[22:48] totally that we we already have that
[22:52] yeah no absolutely and and and that's
[22:54] what's this is where it really starts to
[22:56] get interesting and I know a lot of
[22:57] people aren't so excited about that um
[23:00] but of course you know Bitcoin is this
[23:02] open protocol that that's open to
[23:03] everybody and and you know obviously I
[23:06] urge everybody to to buy as much as you
[23:08] can uh you know whatever is possible um
[23:11] because I do think it's heading that
[23:12] route that um governments are are are
[23:16] going to have to start doing this I mean
[23:17] corporations already doing this that
[23:19] when you're seeing a unit of account
[23:21] that is um being depleted and being
[23:23] diluted over time you need to find a
[23:25] solution uh for that sinking ship and
[23:28] and bit coin is becoming that Savior for
[23:30] a lot of people interesting like it's
[23:32] it's absolutely uh mind boiling for me
[23:36] um how did you see the first time when
[23:39] you heard about Trump is all of the
[23:41] sudden talking about Bitcoin and now
[23:43] like there slowly slowly coming towards
[23:46] like okay maybe we put it on a balance
[23:47] sheets there like this all there there
[23:49] this wealth fund that's going on David
[23:51] zxs and the other guy that I currently
[23:54] lost the name of but like there's
[23:55] there's developments coming in how how
[23:58] did you you look at that is is that the
[24:00] start of the nation Day game theory race
[24:04] uh that we really seeing now yeah I
[24:06] think Howard lutnick is the guy that
[24:08] you're talking about the guy from yeah
[24:09] um Secretary of the Treasury I think but
[24:12] um yeah um it it's fascinating to watch
[24:16] I I think that you realize you know over
[24:19] time especially where we're at with the
[24:20] deficit and and maybe with again our
[24:23] inability to produce Goods at this point
[24:25] because it's all uh with with our rival
[24:28] uh China really for the most part um you
[24:31] realize like well what are we going to
[24:32] do about this this is this is a real
[24:34] issue that that it is not easily solved
[24:38] um
[24:39] and it's especially an issue where no
[24:43] country trusts any other country you
[24:46] know and everyone's looking for a
[24:48] certain I talk about the fight game
[24:50] everyone's kind of looking for the the
[24:53] ability to dominate certain markets and
[24:56] to to dominate certain um to to get
[24:59] certain amounts of control globally
[25:01] whether it's I want to be in control of
[25:03] the oil Market I want to be the most
[25:05] powerful military
[25:07] force um you know whether it's you know
[25:10] you know again like gas and oil or um
[25:14] you know having the most expensive real
[25:16] estate or you know being a major
[25:19] industrial power like China so
[25:21] everyone's trying to dominate these
[25:22] various markets and and Bitcoin uh is is
[25:28] global and there's no government that
[25:31] has decided to kind of go all in on it
[25:33] and now I I don't think they're going to
[25:35] control it the way that they think just
[25:37] based on bitcoin and how it works but um
[25:42] you know if you think that that is going
[25:44] to be the way that people are going to
[25:46] trade on a more fair level then wouldn't
[25:48] you want to have as much of it as
[25:50] possible um and I think that uh you know
[25:54] again when when you realize that a lot
[25:56] of this spending isn't necessarily going
[25:59] away and I know that Trump is looking to
[26:01] cut you know uh use Doge to you know to
[26:04] cut a lot of programs here in there and
[26:06] I think that's helpful but it's not
[26:08] going to solve our deficit you know $ 36
[26:11] trillion in deficit plus is not gonna
[26:14] just go away and I think you need to
[26:16] find various solutions to that and you
[26:20] know I know Trump's talking about
[26:21] tariffs and things like that whether
[26:23] that's actually to make money or whether
[26:25] that's an eventual plan to Deval the
[26:28] dollar and try to bring industry back
[26:30] into the United States I don't know um
[26:33] you know are they playing you know uh
[26:36] three threedimensional chess here and
[26:38] and saying they want to strengthen the
[26:40] dollar when in reality they actually
[26:41] want to just buy Bitcoin and and have as
[26:45] much of that as possible I don't know
[26:47] it's hard to tell um like hard to see
[26:50] like what exactly they're their game
[26:53] plan is um but I do think that
[26:56] they're attempting to make a lot of
[26:58] progress as of right now in um you know
[27:03] doing their best to trying to get get
[27:05] some of that power back bring Industries
[27:07] back into the United States cut a lot of
[27:09] useless spending um and and um yeah just
[27:14] I guess just strengthen the position of
[27:15] the United States uh globally without
[27:19] having to go to war because I think that
[27:21] is proven to be a silly thing um you
[27:25] know not only because of the loss of
[27:27] lives but um you know of course which is
[27:29] horrible but it it's just been this
[27:32] losing game uh where we're just dumping
[27:34] money into this uh very violent uh
[27:38] process uh for the last I guess several
[27:41] decades now um and no nobody wins in
[27:44] that scenario so I think that this is
[27:46] where Bitcoin can kind of come into play
[27:48] I think yeah it's like the the probably
[27:52] best play they can currently do is to
[27:54] strength from the US dollar and the
[27:56] strength from the US is as many Bitcoins
[27:59] as they possibly
[28:01] can yeah I mean why not again if if
[28:04] you're looking for ways you know they
[28:06] they just created a sovereign wealth
[28:07] fund and I think this is how they're
[28:08] going to start it and how they can kind
[28:11] of circumvent the idea of a Bitcoin
[28:14] strategic Reserve um if that doesn't get
[28:17] passed for whatever reason that maybe
[28:20] they have this Sovereign wealth fund
[28:22] that they can create and kind of invest
[28:23] in maybe Bitcoin that way or or kind of
[28:26] have this um du dual pronged way of of
[28:30] accumulating Bitcoin you have your
[28:32] strategic Bitcoin reserve and you have
[28:34] your Sovereign wealth fund you know
[28:35] maybe that's what they're thinking but
[28:37] who knows you know they're investigating
[28:38] it they say they're doing their research
[28:40] now and trying to figure it out whether
[28:42] they're delaying time uh and kind of you
[28:46] know they'll start buying throughout
[28:47] that process in secret I I I don't know
[28:50] right because obviously if you announce
[28:53] that then every country is going to try
[28:57] to have this race to buy as much Bitcoin
[28:59] as possible the price is going to run up
[29:00] now everything's more expensive where is
[29:02] if if they're doing things in in a more
[29:05] subtle way you know perhaps they can
[29:07] they can buy Bitcoin at a lower price
[29:09] you know um so I I don't know you who
[29:12] knows what's going to happen I I don't
[29:13] pretend to know all the all the answers
[29:15] to that but um you know I I think it is
[29:18] something that you need to approach very
[29:20] carefully though absolutely like just
[29:23] just think about if you were the number
[29:27] one guy advising Donald Trump on how to
[29:31] Best Buy Bitcoin like if if you already
[29:34] had that decision of like yeah I want to
[29:36] buy Bitcoin with the United States how
[29:39] do we approach that the best approach
[29:41] would be to send out mixed signals to
[29:46] make it not clear that it actually will
[29:48] happen and to say we investigating it we
[29:52] doing it like and prolonging the the
[29:56] process of it as long as humanly
[29:58] possible and by of since day one yes it
[30:04] it's not an it's not unlikely that this
[30:07] is what's happening obviously we don't
[30:09] know like I definitely don't know but
[30:12] it's not
[30:14] something if that's a possibility uh I
[30:17] would actually recommend the if I would
[30:21] be the number one adviser to to the
[30:23] president of the United States that
[30:25] wants to buy Bitcoin that's exactly the
[30:27] way I would do it if it's a legal
[30:29] framework that is possible 100% you know
[30:32] it's like when when I was training for a
[30:34] fight I I wasn't releasing a bunch of
[30:36] videos and telling everybody what I'm
[30:38] doing to prepare for it and in some
[30:40] cases uh I would give misinformation
[30:42] right I would I say oh you know you know
[30:44] I'm just training not training too much
[30:47] or I'm just working on stuff you just
[30:48] kind of talk very generally about it but
[30:50] if I'm giving the anemy or or my rivals
[30:54] ideas of what exactly I'm doing it's
[30:56] like why why would I do that would I
[30:58] give them my strategy so again you know
[31:01] we we're speculating here we're not sure
[31:02] exactly what they're doing but I would
[31:04] imagine that's what's playing out
[31:07] absolutely you also mentioned the
[31:09] Sovereign wealth fund um what is the
[31:12] difference if they do it with like
[31:14] strategic Bitcoin Reserve versus buying
[31:16] it with the Sovereign wealth fund like
[31:18] do you know the the difference of that I
[31:21] I don't know exactly my understanding of
[31:24] it um is that you know the the Bitcoin
[31:27] iic Reserve is something that needs to
[31:29] be approved that needs to be voted on uh
[31:32] by Congress to to allow it um uh and The
[31:37] Sovereign wealth fund is basically an
[31:39] executive order so Donald Trump is
[31:42] initiating this order that's saying we
[31:45] need to kind of have this United States
[31:47] fund of investing in assets um you know
[31:50] similar to um Saudi Arabia United Arab
[31:53] Emirates Norway you know they have these
[31:56] Investments um you know for for the fund
[31:59] basically the the the taxpayers money um
[32:02] that is going to be able to to to grow
[32:04] in value over time um and yeah so and
[32:09] yeah so that that's my understanding as
[32:10] far as the the difference of it is an
[32:12] executive order can basically basically
[32:14] be executed like now um whereas the
[32:17] other uh the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[32:19] is something that needs to be voted on
[32:21] and and and I don't know I I would
[32:23] assume that the Strategic Bitcoin
[32:25] Reserve would be a much bigger
[32:29] uh purchase right because maybe you have
[32:31] the federal backing behind it and and
[32:34] you know you can you could probably buy
[32:36] a lot more but I I I don't really know
[32:38] enough about it I partnered up with coin
[32:42] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[32:45] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[32:47] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[32:50] love it so much coin viilante made in

[33:33] those watches so so much if you watch or
[33:37] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:39] I'll guess you already bought some
[33:41] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[33:44] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[33:47] in a hardware wallet my personal
[33:49] recommendation for Hardware wallet is

[34:52] for some reason in Congress it's it's
[34:54] not working out he still has an option
[34:57] to Bitcoin anyways that's what I think
[35:00] that's what I think interesting you
[35:02] mentioned also one thing that's I think
[35:03] really important to point out and I
[35:05] think to to to to talk about in this
[35:09] topic is um some people disagree with uh
[35:14] United States buying Bitcoin or even
[35:16] institutions I even heard people like oh
[35:18] they don't like that Michael S is buying
[35:20] so many Bitcoin um uh which brings me to
[35:23] the point of like Bitcoin is for any for
[35:26] enemies Bitcoin is for everyone uh and
[35:28] and there are a lot of people like no
[35:30] like we we don't want those people into
[35:32] Bitcoin which is the most anti- Bitcoin
[35:35] philosophy I ever heard like Bitcoin is
[35:38] free open protocol I just wanted to to
[35:40] to bring this in because if it's I think
[35:42] it's really important that um it's
[35:44] permission less and open and with that
[35:46] it's also permission less and open to
[35:49] institutions uh to governments to to
[35:51] everyone that wants to investigate or
[35:55] invest or participate in in Bitcoin I
[35:59] think there a really important message
[36:00] to to make yeah and it kind of goes
[36:03] against the Bitcoin philosophy in that
[36:05] like I I I understand that Bitcoin
[36:07] probably wasn't well we we don't even
[36:10] know you know I I I think it was more
[36:12] made for you know the regular person um
[36:15] but uh perhaps also it was um someone or
[36:20] a group of people understanding that
[36:22] there was not going to be an escape from
[36:25] monetary debasement that the one thing
[36:28] that could save it uh was the creation
[36:31] of this black hole called Bitcoin that
[36:33] could suck in that monetary energy uh
[36:35] and save it and preserve it um so again
[36:39] you know I think that it it so in some
[36:41] ways it goes against the also kind of
[36:43] the Bitcoin ethos of like you know hey
[36:46] there's this thing called proof of work
[36:48] and there's this idea of you know no
[36:50] one's coming to save you you're going to
[36:52] have to work for it and the only way you
[36:54] can get Bitcoin is mining it um or
[36:57] buying it and it's it's it's free game
[37:01] man it's like it it's open anybody who's
[37:03] capable of doing that and um just
[37:06] accumulate as much as you can absolutely
[37:09] and the the the regular person had now
[37:12] 15 years time to accumulate as much as
[37:15] possible and we are still early like if
[37:17] if you look at the full potential of
[37:19] Bitcoin versus where we are right now um
[37:22] You probably still have a good two three
[37:25] four maybe in five years to accumulate
[37:27] Bitcoin really cheaply versus towards
[37:30] what Bitcoin will be worth in 10 20 50
[37:34] years from now so there there's no like
[37:37] oh like no it's so expensive no it's not
[37:40] 100K is nothing 100% And well and I
[37:43] think that like you know nature is not
[37:47] fair n there there there are predators
[37:50] and there are prey and you have to
[37:52] position yourself the best that you can
[37:54] to to be able to win whatever game that
[37:56] you're playing and
[37:58] and I think that's that's kind of what
[37:59] it comes down to and it's good that
[38:01] nature is not fair I I like that it's it
[38:05] it it's what made us strong as human
[38:07] beings it's it's like the martial arts
[38:09] of life is coming at you and uh and and
[38:12] we as human beings at least till now
[38:15] kind of uh ruled the world to a certain
[38:19] extent uh I'm I'm fairly certain there's
[38:22] more advanced models out there that that
[38:25] are human beings or maybe life forms but
[38:28] uh it's it's good that life throws
[38:30] things at you and and you have to combat
[38:33] that this is where you get the strength
[38:35] of it it's boring if everything is going
[38:38] the right way it's it makes if if I
[38:41] start something new and everything is
[38:42] going good from the getg go and there's
[38:45] no problems coming up it makes me very
[38:47] cons conscious about it oh Absolut
[38:50] absolutely I think that's really well
[38:51] said I think it it's it's a part of the
[38:53] machine like the machine doesn't work if
[38:56] there's no like you know know it's
[38:57] almost like the yin and yang you know
[38:59] it's like I I need this to happen for me
[39:01] to grow and and and these don't these
[39:03] don't happen without each other and and
[39:05] I think that's what allowing you know
[39:08] the smart and the strong to survive and
[39:10] get smarter and stronger like you you
[39:12] need that opposing Force so absolutely
[39:15] interesting um one thing uh with the
[39:17] Strategic Bitcoin Reserve I'm wondering
[39:19] a lot
[39:20] is how do if if it's if now it it looks
[39:25] like Donald Trump and the president like
[39:27] they actually now going ahead and and
[39:29] doing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in
[39:31] some way or shape or form like I think
[39:33] there will there will something come
[39:35] along those lines in 2095 if that
[39:38] actually happens and they are getting
[39:40] more and more in that direction um what
[39:42] happens to the future of the US and the
[39:45] US dollar when they integrate Bitcoin
[39:49] with that what what do you think will
[39:51] that future look like it's hard to say
[39:53] because you know I I think that there's
[39:55] like um there's this idea
[39:57] that you know we want to preserve um you
[40:01] know like preserve the fact that we have
[40:04] the global Reserve currency um but that
[40:08] is a competing thought to what Bitcoin
[40:10] is because you
[40:13] know money is is a winner take all
[40:16] scenario right uh you know that's
[40:18] something that is said over and over and
[40:19] it's absolutely true um you know
[40:21] everything is going to converge to what
[40:23] the best money is and clearly Bitcoin
[40:27] has proven itself to grow uh the fastest
[40:30] and best over time um whereas you know
[40:33] all currencies all Fiat currencies are
[40:36] uh debasing over time and and I just
[40:38] don't see that changing
[40:40] so I don't know um you know even stable
[40:43] coins I I think are a solution up to a
[40:45] certain point because you know like when
[40:48] tether reaches I don't know into like a
[40:51] trillion or a trillion dollars of like
[40:54] having um us treasuries like I don't
[40:57] know like they're going to have a
[40:58] problem on their hands as well now too
[41:01] because um now they're holding something
[41:03] that is you know obviously debasing over
[41:05] time so I don't know I I I think the
[41:07] only kind of solution to that is putting
[41:10] your money into Bitcoin right I so I
[41:13] don't know man and that's why there's
[41:15] certain people out there that are saying
[41:17] that you know like Bitcoin isn't going
[41:19] to the millions it's going into the
[41:20] billions like you know and and I could
[41:23] definitely see that you know um you know
[41:26] a lot further down the line it could
[41:28] definitely go that way um so I don't
[41:31] know exactly what what is going to
[41:33] happen in that regard but I I think the
[41:35] best case scenario is that it does
[41:37] happen slowly over time so there's not
[41:39] this like huge disparity of of wealth
[41:43] and you know chaos um so
[41:46] I I I don't know it's hard to predict
[41:49] exactly how it's going to go down but
[41:51] like you know like we were talking about
[41:52] earlier if if that's the case and if you
[41:55] kind of know that to be true then I
[41:57] think everybody is is realizing now like
[41:59] in the United States it seems like you
[42:01] know more corporations and now every
[42:03] state is trying to you know create this
[42:05] Bitcoin strategic Reserve why be because
[42:08] they know it's going up and they also
[42:10] know uh the endgame potentially for the
[42:13] for the US dollar um
[42:15] so where are you going to store your
[42:18] value what is the best case scenario
[42:20] what where where is the most likely what
[42:23] is the most likely scenario I think
[42:25] people are understanding that um
[42:28] you know you want to accumulate as much
[42:29] Bitcoin as possible I I have this
[42:32] podcast now for almost 400 episodes and
[42:35] every day I'm like I have to buy more
[42:38] Bitcoin but I'm like I'm I'm already all
[42:40] in how GNA do that I
[42:43] know you get a lot of uh for like I I'm
[42:49] because I do a daily podcast I'm really
[42:51] as good towards like oh that's bullish
[42:53] for Bitcoin that's bullish for Bitcoin
[42:54] that's bullish for Bitcoin I'm I'm
[42:56] trying to myself down sometimes I'm like
[42:59] okay maybe it's not all happening
[43:01] tomorrow it's okay if if things are
[43:05] taking time um because I'm in this
[43:08] bubble of talking to so many bitcoiners
[43:10] every year like 365 bitcoiners every
[43:12] year that's that's a massive amount and
[43:14] and you canot get in into like a a
[43:17] bitcoiners uh T mindset 100% Robin and
[43:22] then you know the other thing is is the
[43:24] Sab 121 you know uh you know with what's
[43:28] happening with with banks now having the
[43:30] ability to custody Bitcoin now I am I
[43:33] going to give my Bitcoin to a bank
[43:35] probably not but this is an option and
[43:38] now that you have these larger
[43:39] institutions that are going to be
[43:42] allowed to custody Bitcoin and and you
[43:44] can make loans against it I think this
[43:46] is another GameChanger I mean you look
[43:48] at you know real estate is what it is
[43:51] because of this like and and now if you
[43:55] compare Bitcoin to real estate and if
[43:58] you're a bank and you're going all right
[44:01] there's all these vulnerabilities with
[44:03] real estate we just saw it in Los
[44:05] Angeles where some of the most expensive
[44:07] homes in the country were burned down to
[44:11] the
[44:11] ground and you know you you look at that
[44:14] from a vulnerability standpoint you look
[44:16] at that from an insurance standpoint um
[44:19] and then you look at this ass asset
[44:21] called Bitcoin which can't be burned
[44:24] down it can't be hacked um it can't be
[44:28] taken um you don't have to pay uh you
[44:31] don't have to pay uh maintenance fees on
[44:34] it you don't have to pay utilities on it
[44:37] um like and it's literal pure value um
[44:42] like it's going to be a way better asset
[44:46] for the banks um you know to custody
[44:49] than than real estate you know to give
[44:51] loans against it it's like if you you're
[44:53] holding Pure Energy pure uh economic
[44:56] power as as opposed to you know uh now
[44:59] having the right to a certain home if
[45:00] they don't pay their mortgage or
[45:02] something like it's a no-brainer a
[45:05] Bitcoin is going to take off like crazy
[45:06] now how responsible the banks are going
[45:08] to be moving forward I don't know you
[45:11] know hopefully there's some kind of
[45:13] protective rights for for people and and
[45:15] who who own Bitcoin in that regard but
[45:17] like I don't know man like that's
[45:19] another one where I I could see
[45:21] this being another huge huge Tailwind
[45:24] for Bitcoin as well as far as the price
[45:27] the the great thing with Bitcoin is like
[45:30] a lot of people say like oh like then we
[45:32] we'll develop the same thing with gold
[45:35] no like Bitcoin is digital so we have
[45:38] the possibilities of actually verifying
[45:40] where the Bitcoin is like if you have
[45:42] yeah immediately if you have for example
[45:44] like two Bitcoin and Bitcoin is like at
[45:47] one million and you have like those $2
[45:48] million and you want to have like a loan
[45:50] out of like I don't know 200,000 uh
[45:53] dollars at one point uh you will be able
[45:57] to have a multi signature setup whether
[46:01] it's an escrow or DLC or whatever uh
[46:05] with a bank where you have part control
[46:08] of your Bitcoin you see exactly where
[46:10] it's sitting uh and they cannot do
[46:12] anything with it yeah this is a total
[46:15] Game Changer like this never happened
[46:17] before and this will completely change
[46:19] the banking system 100% it's like show
[46:22] me how much gold is out there with
[46:23] Precision show me exactly how much gold
[46:26] is out there there right now please now
[46:28] show me how much gold is under the
[46:30] ground right now please show me you know
[46:34] you can't like you cannot Bitcoin um you
[46:37] can see it all you know it uh with
[46:40] certainty uh and that's where the game
[46:42] changes um and uh not only do you know
[46:45] it with certainty but it's predictable
[46:47] you you know there will only be 21 Bill
[46:49] 21 million Bitcoin right um so with gold
[46:53] there's there's a lot of uncertainty um
[46:55] and you know and it can cost associated
[46:57] with it it's like okay where are you
[46:59] going to send that gold how much is that
[47:01] going to cost now not only do you have
[47:02] to ship it and send it but you need to
[47:04] assay the gold and like you said prove
[47:06] that it is actual gold and that's a
[47:08] whole chemical process that you need to
[47:10] undergo and it's so yeah it's um Bitcoin
[47:14] is is such a GameChanger in that regard
[47:16] and I I I think it's good you know it
[47:18] already is changing the game but I think
[47:20] again we are just getting started
[47:23] interesting do do you feel like the
[47:25] verifying aspect effect is the most
[47:28] important value of of Bitcoin I mean
[47:30] there are so many important values in
[47:32] there but like what what what would you
[47:33] say is like the the the number one that
[47:35] that makes Bitcoin so
[47:37] valuable gosh you know like like we said
[47:39] you know it is such a multi-prong tool
[47:43] that does so much um but I guess the
[47:48] fact that you can preserve preserve your
[47:52] uh savings over time you know that that
[47:56] for for people who are keeping their
[47:59] head above water in in these very
[48:01] difficult Economic Times where inflation
[48:04] is taking a hold and everything is more
[48:06] expensive and your money doesn't buy
[48:09] what it used to or if you're worried
[48:11] about you know having money when you
[48:13] retire to survive or if you're looking
[48:16] for a way to preserve that to pass that
[48:19] on to your children I mean there was a
[48:21] time where a million having a million
[48:23] dollars was a big deal where it's like
[48:26] oh man like you have a million dollars
[48:29] wow for someone who's retiring in their
[48:32] 60s or 70s like or 80 like that's going
[48:36] to be a difficult thing to retire off a
[48:38] million dollars now especially not even
[48:40] knowing what how much things are going
[48:42] to cost in the future like you know so I
[48:45] guess you the preservation of of of your
[48:48] savings I think where I think it it's
[48:50] most powerful just for the regular
[48:51] person but like I don't know it of
[48:54] course there there's so many different
[48:55] aspects to it but um that its defensive
[48:59] properties um you know is huge and of
[49:01] course in association with its inability
[49:03] to be you know for the for the network
[49:04] to be hacked I think is uh is huge
[49:06] obviously as well absolutely it's fun to
[49:09] think about the the different
[49:12] perspective of like you can't even
[49:14] retire now on a million dollar I mean if
[49:17] you invest a million dollars you
[49:19] probably are capable of of doing that
[49:21] but like just looking at from a US
[49:23] dollar perspective um at some point you
[49:26] will be be able to retire on one Bitcoin
[49:28] like one Bitcoin will be such a huge
[49:30] amount where like easily can retire on
[49:33] that you probably can retire a whole
[49:35] family on that that's massive yeah yeah
[49:38] yeah for sure really interesting um one
[49:41] thing that I also want to get into with
[49:43] you I think it could be really uh fun uh
[49:46] because uh uh of the fighting and the
[49:48] sports
[49:49] background how valuable or like how
[49:53] influential is that proof of work
[49:55] philosophy for you in Bitcoin but also
[49:59] for you in in in in the in the world in
[50:01] in your life yeah so um I guess it
[50:06] depends on on on what angle you're
[50:08] looking at it from but I I think the
[50:11] idea that um you know Bitcoin is this
[50:15] truth machine uh is really interesting
[50:18] um where it's not this isn't Theory
[50:22] right it's like you either beat that guy
[50:24] or you don't and we're either going to
[50:27] see if you put the work into a training
[50:30] camp in preparation for that fight or
[50:32] you didn't for the most part over time
[50:34] we'll certainly see that I can only get
[50:36] away with I can only get away with not
[50:40] training hard um maybe one fight maybe
[50:43] two fights I got lucky I landed a lucky
[50:46] punch and I did it but if we were to
[50:48] take my results over time and if I
[50:50] wasn't putting the right amount of work
[50:53] into it that you would see that I would
[50:55] be losing way more fights than winning
[50:57] more fights and um you know that's why
[51:01] it's so crazy that people still doubt
[51:03] Bitcoin it's like this is the best
[51:05] performing asset for a long time now um
[51:10] governments have tried to shut it down
[51:12] people have tried to to shut it down
[51:14] people have been trying to control this
[51:15] thing um and the truth will always come
[51:18] out the light will always defeat the
[51:21] dark and I think that's what is so cool
[51:25] and it's the same thing with fighting
[51:26] it's like it may take you a little bit
[51:28] longer certain people longer than others
[51:30] but we're going to find out if you've
[51:32] been putting in the work or not why
[51:34] because we're going to see the results
[51:36] this isn't going to be you know uh even
[51:39] a debate of of words that's open to
[51:42] interpretation you either win or you
[51:43] lose in fighting that's it for the most
[51:46] part um you of course there's certain
[51:48] controversies but if it if if I get a
[51:52] finish let's say with a submission hold
[51:54] or I knock you out there is no
[51:55] discussion who won that fight it's it's
[51:59] you can't debate it um so in that regard
[52:02] it's very similar um you know with
[52:05] Bitcoin and what it's been doing and and
[52:07] I think that um you know there is this
[52:10] beautiful truth about it because of
[52:13] it I like games where there are clear
[52:15] rules that's why I sometimes have
[52:18] problems with soccer or football however
[52:20] you want to call it um because there's
[52:23] so much debate going on with the rules
[52:25] and if you look at actually at the rules
[52:28] uh for example if if a ball goes to the
[52:30] hand you can interpret it in in many
[52:33] different ways move his
[52:36] hand is it an active move or is it like
[52:40] like you can argue a lot on that and I
[52:43] mean that's also probably why football
[52:47] is so uh famous because like you can
[52:49] argue and you can then talk about it and
[52:51] stuff like that but I like games where
[52:54] there are very clear rules uh and
[52:57] everyone has to follow them and there's
[52:58] not even a chance of of cheating that's
[53:00] why I like Bitcoin so much because like
[53:02] there's very clear rules and you know uh
[53:05] if you you just know there's so many
[53:08] Bitcoin in that wallet and and you
[53:09] cannot cheat on that and you cannot make
[53:11] more of I I like that aspect a lot yeah
[53:14] no I I think that's beautifully said
[53:16] 100% agree with you and and not only
[53:18] that the fact that it's also so simple
[53:21] you know like it again to get something
[53:24] very simple I think it involves a lot
[53:26] complexity right the the the just the
[53:29] the philosophy behind Bitcoin the the
[53:31] technical aspects of Bitcoin um you know
[53:34] thinking about all the things that you
[53:36] know how you're going to design this
[53:38] code to develop Bitcoin is is very
[53:41] complex but in the execution of it it's
[53:43] very simple with very simple rules you
[53:46] know where there is no interpretation
[53:49] it's just it is what it is it is or it
[53:52] isn't um and and I I think that that's
[53:55] what makes Simplicity so beautiful and
[53:57] and Bitcoin is absolutely that that's
[54:00] beautifully said yeah really cool how
[54:02] much by the way is inviting strength
[54:05] versus skill like uh is is like if
[54:08] someone has almost no strength is even
[54:12] possible to do with with with skill yeah
[54:14] so that that's a that's a really good um
[54:17] kind of debate point that that a lot of
[54:19] people talk about because um you know
[54:23] physical gifts are are are a great thing
[54:25] to have you know to be blessed with
[54:26] tremendous strength or speed or size um
[54:30] can be a huge Advantage um however you
[54:33] know when you're in a sport where other
[54:35] people have those same things technique
[54:38] will be king So if if if if the physical
[54:42] qualities are equal technique will be
[54:45] king what's interesting about that if
[54:47] the physical qualities um are very
[54:50] Advanced but technique is King right
[54:53] that you have one person who's highly
[54:54] Technical and the other person person
[54:56] just has physical skills but not not a
[54:58] whole lot of technique technique will
[55:00] win out um so as you lessen the
[55:03] technique or as you lessen the technique
[55:06] the physical qualities will start to
[55:09] even itself out right and when the
[55:11] physical qualities are are relatively
[55:13] even the person who has higher technique
[55:16] will usually win out not all the time um
[55:19] so that that's why it is certainly
[55:21] important to have both things as much as
[55:23] possible you have to come in shape you
[55:24] want to be as strong as possible you
[55:26] want to to be as flexible as possible
[55:28] you you you know all those things are
[55:29] are no doubt important but to me um the
[55:34] knowhow of fighting is is vastly more
[55:37] important and way more interesting to me
[55:40] um you know and maybe that's because I
[55:42] wasn't blessed with a ton of physical
[55:43] gifts but to me the the technical aspect
[55:46] of fighting is what what really got me
[55:47] to fall in love with it because it got
[55:49] me to understand that yes a smaller
[55:52] person can defeat a larger person if
[55:55] they really know what they're doing on a
[55:57] technical level I love that I I relate
[56:00] to that a lot I'm not a fighter I'm a
[56:02] swimmer and uh in
[56:05] swimming uh it's so clear that if you
[56:09] are uh long if you're large like me I'm
[56:12] almost two meters long like I have I
[56:14] have huge hands also like I have a lot
[56:16] of uh lot of advantages in swimming yes
[56:20] um but if you don't know how to swim
[56:23] like that like that doesn't bring you
[56:25] anywhere and in swimming you really
[56:28] notice the techniques and then if you
[56:31] have similar techniques obviously if you
[56:34] are a similar technique level and you
[56:36] just larger like you just like have more
[56:39] uh C uh body length you will uh win out
[56:43] over the other one 100% 100% And you'll
[56:46] see people cater their style of fighting
[56:48] to their physical qualities that they
[56:50] have for example in your case I would be
[56:52] like you know Robin you really want to
[56:54] you know develop a very educated jab to
[56:57] keep people on the outside so they can
[56:59] never touch you right it's similar to
[57:01] that and also it it varies by the sport
[57:04] your physical ability uh allows you to
[57:07] be a great swimmer now swimming at
[57:10] having swam before and you know talk to
[57:13] some high level swimmers technique is
[57:14] definitely involved you want to be
[57:16] efficient right so you can perform
[57:17] better you there's less drag in the
[57:19] water all that stuff is super important
[57:22] um so in a sport let's say like swimming
[57:25] or sprinting
[57:26] physical ability is King right more than
[57:29] anything else because it doesn't matter
[57:32] how much I work on my technique I'll
[57:34] never be a better swimmer than you it's
[57:36] just not gonna happen I'll never be
[57:37] faster than Hussein bolt in a 100 meter
[57:39] race it's just not no matter how much I
[57:41] work on it you know but if let's say all
[57:44] of us maybe play Golf the person with
[57:47] the best technique is going to be the
[57:49] best golfer the physical abilities okay
[57:51] there's they matter I guess a little bit
[57:54] sure but technique is more important to
[57:57] that game in Golf I would I would argue
[57:59] than say something like swimming or
[58:01] sprinting like physical physical
[58:02] abilities are probably more important if
[58:04] that makes sense MMA it's
[58:06] maybe 6040 something like that I don't
[58:09] know that's an interesting I never
[58:12] looked at sports of like a spectrum
[58:16] between skill and um strength where in
[58:20] swimming strength is really important uh
[58:24] like you I mean there is interesting
[58:27] like I sometimes see in the pool very
[58:30] muscular guys that fight with the water
[58:32] and have obviously no no technique it
[58:34] looks really funny um and and I applaud
[58:37] them because they try to swiming and and
[58:39] and but they are they like I have good
[58:43] techniques so I can swim for like two
[58:45] three four hours and it's like walking
[58:47] to me um and it's probably like three
[58:51] times faster than like a muscular guy
[58:53] trying to fight his life so like you
[58:55] need the base technique but you're right
[58:57] like uh if someone has the same level of
[59:00] technique the the body size the the
[59:03] strength this just completely outweighs
[59:06] everything um and then on golf it's
[59:10] interesting because you can be really
[59:13] unfit and uh even like um uh fat or like
[59:18] very thin or like almost no muscles if
[59:21] you know how to hit the ball you
[59:23] probably are really good in goals like
[59:26] strength you need to yeah sure you you
[59:28] have to move that small of a ball like
[59:30] that strength you have to have but most
[59:32] people have that I think uh and then
[59:34] it's just about the technique so yeah
[59:36] that's a really interesting I never
[59:38] thought about that actually there's a
[59:40] scale of that yeah no for sure you know
[59:43] and that's where like efficiency comes
[59:45] into play whether you're talking about
[59:46] Bitcoin or something else is that you
[59:48] know the value of having Superior
[59:50] technique is that it's easily repeatable
[59:54] right it's like you know for every pool
[59:56] lap that I'm doing maybe I'm keeping up
[59:58] with you for the first five laps but
[60:00] over time my frame and my technique is
[60:03] such that like Robin now is just like on
[60:05] the sixth lap that's where you just
[60:06] really kind of perform and and now I'm
[60:09] just left in the dust right so um yeah
[60:12] it's it it's a fascinating thing that
[60:14] that's what intrigues me so much about
[60:16] like the technical aspects of of of
[60:18] fighting is is the efficiency aspect of
[60:21] like how do I hone in my technique to be
[60:23] so good that I'm using less energy than
[60:25] you yeah I love that yeah I also liked
[60:28] swimming all in when I was like now I
[60:31] don't do competition now I swim three
[60:33] times a week uh but coming back to that
[60:36] clear rules in I don't know there
[60:38] probably other sports that are also like
[60:40] very close to that level but in swimming
[60:42] there's almost no debates um like you
[60:45] you have a starting signal and you know
[60:48] exactly like did you move before the
[60:50] starting signal then you're are
[60:51] disqualified if you haven't moved before
[60:54] then you're okay uh uh then there's like
[60:57] you can only be a certain amount
[60:59] underwater there's a clear rule where
[61:01] you have to get
[61:02] overwater uh and like they are very
[61:05] clear rules you can uh see them very
[61:08] nicely uh and then it's just like who
[61:10] was faster yeah like that's it
[61:12] stopwatches and they are like extremely
[61:15] accurate and there's no debate going on
[61:18] uh uh where else there's other sports uh
[61:22] and I don't there Pro there might be
[61:24] some some sports that are less debatable
[61:26] like than swimming uh and maybe that's
[61:28] why swimming is not that popular because
[61:31] you cannot debate a lot like he was
[61:33] faster for sure for sure and in fighting
[61:36] you you will get that debate because the
[61:38] rules sometimes are open to
[61:40] interpretation so if it is it went the
[61:43] full distance of about now it's these
[61:45] judges that are standing in different
[61:47] aspects of the cage that are making
[61:50] judgments on on who won the fight and
[61:52] they may not have seen all the punches
[61:53] or they may be seeing it differently or
[61:55] May not have certain amount of
[61:56] experience in certain areas and and
[61:59] that's the cool thing about you know
[62:00] Racing type um events where it's like
[62:03] they're there's very little debate it's
[62:05] it's right there we have the technology
[62:07] to see who got there first and that's it
[62:08] yeah and and and there's one more small
[62:11] aspect sorry about going on on swimming
[62:13] so much but there's one one more aspect
[62:15] on swimming that is very unique um you
[62:18] cannot communicate to the other
[62:20] competitors like with with with like
[62:23] boxing or like martial arts you see him
[62:25] like you can make some some some faces
[62:27] and stuff like that with with football
[62:29] there's a lot of communication going on
[62:32] uh but in swimming you could look at the
[62:34] other one but this like then you lost
[62:37] the race when you look at the other one
[62:38] and even if you try to speak something
[62:40] nobody will understand what you spoke
[62:42] because you're underwater it's a it's a
[62:44] really unique aspect of
[62:46] swimming you just swim for yourself
[62:48] basically and you know what's going on
[62:52] that is true yeah really cool um one
[62:55] last question before we come to the end
[62:56] routine um uh with all the things that
[63:00] we now talked about and how bullish we
[63:02] are on bitcoin how do you think what is
[63:05] the major thing that Bitcoin will change
[63:07] uh in this world gosh if something at
[63:10] all like maybe it doesn't change maybe
[63:12] you think that nothing changes with vion
[63:15] I I think a lot of things are going to
[63:16] change a lot of things that um that I
[63:20] probably don't see uh as well but I I
[63:23] think um I think in a lot of ways it's
[63:25] going to to get rid of the idea of um
[63:28] wasteful
[63:30] spending that's intriguing to me and and
[63:33] if you ask me an hour later or tomorrow
[63:34] I may have a different answer but I
[63:36] think that when you realize that you
[63:38] have the best asset possible and and you
[63:42] have the best protocol for preserving
[63:44] your
[63:45] money
[63:47] that you you need a great excuse to
[63:49] spend it right it's like why why
[63:52] bitcoiners are so adamant about not not
[63:55] selling their Bitcoin it's like you have
[63:57] to give a very very strong argument for
[64:00] you wanting to sell it um so either you
[64:03] have a lot of it or you need something
[64:06] really badly and that's what money
[64:08] really should be right is you know and
[64:11] that's what's interesting and I think
[64:13] you can you can make that same um I
[64:16] guess argument for let's say government
[64:18] spending in a lot of ways like you know
[64:21] um I I think there's a ton of wasteful
[64:24] spending and a lot of UN necessary
[64:26] spending and I think often times people
[64:29] need to be reminded that that money is
[64:32] actually your money that's your
[64:33] taxpaying money that's funding those
[64:37] programs or funding those Wars or
[64:39] funding whatever it is and I think that
[64:43] U You Know Jack MERS said it best like
[64:46] you know why would I use something that
[64:48] someone else can print for free um so I
[64:52] I think it it it changes people's fund m
[64:55] al understanding about money and value
[64:59] and savings and and not only individuals
[65:02] but corporations um you know um
[65:06] governments you know so I think it makes
[65:08] everything more efficient as a result um
[65:12] and it really kind of flips flips it on
[65:17] its head I I I think and I I just think
[65:20] also it's just um oftentimes a very
[65:24] unfair
[65:25] system that involves so much cronyism in
[65:28] in so many different uh ways um so I I
[65:32] think it it brings
[65:35] back uh a lot more fairness uh it brings
[65:39] rules to the table um and there's
[65:42] nothing anybody can do to change it so I
[65:45] think it's and I think it's going to
[65:47] make it a more peaceful world a more
[65:49] truthful World um so I I think you the
[65:53] effects of that are extremely positive
[65:56] and and um and wide reaching it's
[66:00] interesting how like I experienced that
[66:04] now really hard uh where most of my
[66:07] income is actually in Bitcoin and I do
[66:11] everything in my power currently uh and
[66:14] I'm rethinking that a little bit uh do
[66:16] not spend Bitcoin uh and and I haven't
[66:20] spent any of my Bitcoin and I'm in a
[66:22] special situation because of some old
[66:24] Austrian law
[66:26] actually most of my Bitcoin stack is
[66:28] taxfree oh wow I wouldn't even sell I
[66:32] wouldn't even have to pay capital gains
[66:34] tax if I spend my Bitcoin like most of
[66:38] my stack is actually taxfree which is
[66:40] fascinating um and even though there's
[66:43] no tax hurdle there's no technical
[66:46] hurdle I don't want to spend my Bitcoin
[66:48] like I'm I'm like trying to overdraft my
[66:51] my my bank account and trying to like
[66:54] okay where can I get like fear income
[66:57] and I I I don't want to spend my Bitcoin
[67:00] I will have to this year like there's no
[67:03] question like most of your income is
[67:04] coming in Bitcoin you already all in
[67:06] Bitcoin like you have to pay for your
[67:08] life somehow but uh it's it's super
[67:12] interesting how I just don't like I'm
[67:15] even looking at like borrowing against
[67:17] it and I don't know I don't really want
[67:19] to do it because of Peace of Mind peace
[67:21] of mind is uh something that I'm really
[67:24] uh liking and I I don't think the rates
[67:26] are are fair like the most like the the
[67:29] fire fishes the the all the all the uh
[67:32] nexo and Lenton and stuff like that like
[67:36] 10 10 12% but things are going to change
[67:38] soon Robin you know where that can be an
[67:40] option where you'll get uh more
[67:43] agreeable rates to to what people are
[67:45] getting for homes and mortgages and
[67:46] things like that so I think that's an
[67:48] interesting thing where you can you know
[67:50] assuming they have a a nice protocol
[67:52] protocol maybe where things AR in multi-
[67:54] and you know
[67:56] um you you can start to um you know
[67:59] borrow against it and and you can keep
[68:01] it similar to how people do with real
[68:02] estate so interesting times I I would I
[68:06] think under 7% in a multi signature
[68:10] setup I would do it I think like that
[68:12] that's a rate and terms that I can I
[68:14] don't want to send my Bitcoin to some
[68:16] exchange and get like 50% loan to value
[68:18] like that that's not something that I'm
[68:20] I'm looking forward to do so it has to
[68:22] be some escrow or DLC or something like
[68:24] that and and I'm not willing to pay more
[68:27] than 7% like around 7% it makes sense
[68:31] for me even though it's it's crazy
[68:33] because we all know like no matter if
[68:36] it's 7% or 12% Bitcoin will outdo that
[68:39] if you do it like five 10 years uh one
[68:43] thing also most of the platforms are
[68:45] like more shortterm like Firefish for
[68:47] example only has 18 months uh as a
[68:50] duration if I don't do that I want to do
[68:53] it five years like 10 years like like
[68:56] boring
[68:57] like but we will you I agree you we will
[69:01] have a lot of Innovations coming into
[69:02] the in this space will will be really
[69:04] fun to see in the next coming years yeah
[69:08] absolutely um one question that I asked
[69:09] each and every one of my guests is what
[69:11] can we learn from you besides
[69:14] Bitcoin let's see um you know I I talked
[69:17] about uh I guess you know a little bit
[69:19] about my fighting career um I uh I like
[69:23] teaching a lot I I I really enjoy
[69:25] teaching uh martial arts a lot I also
[69:28] I'm I'm I'm into uh uh pistols and and
[69:31] and uh you know pistol shooting and
[69:33] competing in in pistols where you kind
[69:35] of run around and hit targets and things
[69:37] like that that's been another kind of
[69:39] technical uh thing that I've been into
[69:41] and I'm starting to teach that as well
[69:43] and um that that that's pretty much it I
[69:47] I I love um you know kind of the that
[69:51] Warrior mindset and and um the
[69:53] Improvement of of I guess uh technique
[69:58] that's something I've always been really
[69:59] not not even passionate about but I
[70:01] probably get obsessed about it uh where
[70:03] I'm thinking about it all day but yeah
[70:07] yeah really interesting uh we have tin
[70:10] in the podcast where the previous guest
[70:11] is asking a question for the next guest
[70:13] without knowing who the next guest
[70:14] actually is uh and uh the question from
[70:17] the previous guest to you is if you were
[70:20] to imagine money better than Bitcoin
[70:23] what feature would it have oh my God
[70:25] gosh interesting um anytime I I try to
[70:28] think about you know the vulnerabilities
[70:30] of Bitcoin I
[70:32] I it's hard to come up with something um
[70:36] if I were to come up with a money that
[70:38] would be better than Bitcoin what would
[70:41] it be I guess maybe an like uh I guess
[70:45] as of right now may maybe
[70:47] uh and and it's getting easier may maybe
[70:50] an easier
[70:52] way of securing it and and using
[70:57] it that that maybe involves less steps
[71:00] maybe like some kind of easier way of of
[71:04] using it in that regard but it's pretty
[71:07] easy but may maybe that would be the
[71:09] only thing because you know there's a
[71:11] certain amount of responsibility needed
[71:13] for it of course you can't just right um
[71:17] but I don't know it's super interesting
[71:19] that question because I also never
[71:20] thought about that question before he he
[71:23] approach it but when I was when was
[71:25] giving it to me I was I was thinking
[71:27] about it like I don't know if there's
[71:29] any like all the things come with
[71:31] trade-offs for example one thing that is
[71:34] bad is not everyone will have uh access
[71:37] to the main layer because it's somebody
[71:39] will be priced
[71:40] out but that's why it's secure like
[71:43] that's why it's decentralized like we we
[71:45] cannot open up the space for every world
[71:46] like there's always trade-offs to do the
[71:49] the
[71:50] things and maybe one feature that we
[71:53] need in the future and we probably can
[71:56] program that in but we need uh longer
[71:59] times to sync between planets at one
[72:02] point right right no it's true and it's
[72:04] the same with fighting where I I tell
[72:05] people all the time like you can't have
[72:07] all the things what you need you want
[72:10] the best options but all you're really
[72:13] doing is like you can add layers for
[72:15] protection in some ways but it doesn't
[72:17] make it uh you know impenetrable in
[72:20] certain ways if you're looking at it
[72:22] security from you know a physical
[72:24] security standpoint or whatever so yeah
[72:26] you you can't always have all the things
[72:28] you just want to look for the best
[72:30] options so yeah that's interesting
[72:33] really cool thank you so much Kenny for
