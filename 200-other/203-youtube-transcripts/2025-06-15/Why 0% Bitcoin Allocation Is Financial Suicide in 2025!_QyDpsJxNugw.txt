[00:00] And even if I would hate Bitcoin, I
[00:02] think with today's standing of Bitcoin,
[00:05] I would not have a 0% allocation. It
[00:07] would just be insanely dumb. You can be
[00:09] in a society trending towards that. Or
[00:11] you can be in a society trending towards
[00:14] maybe a little more individual freedom,
[00:17] a little more economic freedom. If you
[00:19] have the choice, you'd rather be in a
[00:20] state being pro Bitcoin than in a in a
[00:23] state being a pro- fiat and trying to
[00:25] prohibit Bitcoin. Game theory says there
[00:27] will be nations adopting Bitcoin, right?
[00:29] I mean, at Swanson, we've talked about
[00:31] this, I don't know, four to five years
[00:33] ago and and now it really happens. High
[00:35] time preference is some kind of the the
[00:38] mental end result of inflationary money.
[00:41] We've come too far in centralization and
[00:44] in bureaucratic overhead that I see any
[00:47] possibility for them to to make the
[00:48] U-turn and say, "Okay, let's go towards
[00:50] free markets and prosperity now." I I
[00:52] just don't see that to be honest. to
[00:54] you.
[00:56] [Music]
[00:59] My name is Fab. Uh, initially I
[01:03] co-started the German Bitcoin
[01:06] podcast which um some of the viewers or
[01:10] listeners of yours might know. Um, it
[01:13] then trended towards a grassroots
[01:16] community movement in in the German
[01:18] speaking regions. I'd say uh in parallel
[01:22] I co-founded the Bitcoin publishing
[01:24] company APrico Media
[01:27] um which uh until today is quite
[01:30] successful. We brought books like the
[01:33] Bitcoin Standard, broken money. Um, The
[01:36] Price of Tomorrow from Jeff Booth uh
[01:38] into the German language and um I'd say
[01:41] this really helped the German speaking
[01:44] Bitcoiners to to yeah increase speed of
[01:48] adoption, I'd say. Um,
[01:52] and the third thing I'm doing in this
[01:55] space since 2022 is I am the head of
[01:58] content and education at Coinfinity, a
[02:02] Bitcoin only broker um that just as my
[02:06] publishing company uh really wants to
[02:10] wants to hit hard with Bitcoin education
[02:12] because uh at Coinfinity we think that
[02:16] this is the right way to to gain uh
[02:19] customers.
[02:20] You know, you could of course um pay
[02:23] millions of euros or dollars for
[02:25] Instagram or social media ads. Um but
[02:28] you can as well uh start building a
[02:30] relationship with your customer just by
[02:33] educating them. Um and then hoping
[02:36] they'll
[02:37] land at your service or use your your
[02:39] product uh someday after. Um and until
[02:43] today that paid off really well. We are
[02:46] we are growing in the Bitcoiner space.
[02:49] Um, yeah, there's that. And the last and
[02:52] newest pillar of what I'm doing in the
[02:54] Bitcoin space is I am co-hosting the uh
[02:58] Unaduk podcast, which in English in
[03:00] English means under pressure podcast
[03:03] with uh Luca Roller, who's a social
[03:06] media finance influencer, I'd say. And
[03:10] there we um again, and I think that's
[03:14] that's in general my main focus in the
[03:16] Bitcoin space.
[03:17] Um, we are trying to
[03:21] bring the idea of Bitcoin to an an even
[03:26] further circle of of of of of folks um
[03:30] the finance and ETF guys who maybe um
[03:33] still think it's it's a scam and still
[03:36] think um they are they are good in
[03:38] investing by choosing stocks or or or
[03:42] buying ETFs. Um and we slowly want to
[03:45] bring them to not just entrepreneurship
[03:48] and and um philosophy in general but as
[03:52] well to to Bitcoin as the logical
[03:55] conclusion of thinking about money and
[03:57] finances. for me also the the German
[04:00] speaking uh community like there's
[04:03] always the grassroots movement of the of
[04:06] a specific area and then there's how the
[04:09] elite of the politics and and and bigger
[04:13] people kind of perceive it and in
[04:15] Germany and in the German speaking area
[04:18] uh in uh entirely the the difference
[04:21] between how far we are already in the
[04:24] grassroots movement and how slow we are
[04:27] on the politics level is I think the
[04:29] biggest in the whole world. I don't have
[04:31] any studies to support that. It's just
[04:33] my my subjective feeling. But if you
[04:36] look at America, the grassroots movement
[04:38] is kind of strong there. Um when you I
[04:41] hear how many people show up to meetups
[04:43] and stuff like that. So they have a
[04:44] strong grassroots movement. But also
[04:46] politicians are slowly starting to get
[04:49] it and there's a lot of discussions.
[04:50] Then I see on the European level or on
[04:54] the German level, there are rarely even
[04:56] discussions on on a big scale, but the
[04:59] the the community is really strong when
[05:02] you look at full node operators, when
[05:04] you look at the meetup sizes and all of
[05:06] those things. How how do you see that?
[05:09] Um I I totally agree. I think the the
[05:12] gap is the at least biggest I'm aware of
[05:15] internationally. Um, and if politicians
[05:18] in the EU or Germany are talking about
[05:20] Bitcoin, it's most mostly about um
[05:24] should they prohibit it in any way or h
[05:27] how should they tax it or should they um
[05:31] tax it higher?
[05:33] Um I I I think the the the gap I don't
[05:36] really understand why it is. I don't
[05:38] know if it's just the EU's influence as
[05:43] a yeah, let's say bureaucratic monster
[05:47] or if it's Germans themselves who um
[05:52] because of the German past and and
[05:54] hyperinflations are cautious with things
[05:57] like Bitcoin while they
[06:00] should just with Bitcoin not be cautious
[06:03] at all, you know, because Bitcoin would
[06:05] be the thing saving them from from from
[06:07] inflation or hyperinflation.
[06:10] Um, but I have to admit that's that's a
[06:14] tough point to get. If you're like in
[06:16] normie world, you have your 9 to5 job.
[06:18] Uh, you don't even have time to read a
[06:20] book here and there, then it's quite
[06:22] complicated to to grasp Bitcoin in its
[06:26] completeness. I mean, nobody will ever
[06:29] get Bitcoin completely, but but but just
[06:31] starting to understand all the different
[06:34] different um shades it has and the and
[06:37] the different topics it it touches.
[06:40] Yeah, that's super interesting. Uh when
[06:42] you when you look at the current
[06:43] situation because I talk with a lot of
[06:45] Americans obviously with an English
[06:47] speaking podcast and uh I always am a
[06:50] little bit envy that they can talk about
[06:52] the politics stuff. like, oh, like it's
[06:55] it's hard to do that in in in in
[06:57] Germany. Um, how do you actually look at
[06:59] 2095? What's going on with Bitcoin? I
[07:02] think 2094 was a very significant year
[07:04] with the ETF, with the h havinging with
[07:07] the 100K mark. Uh, what do you kind of
[07:09] expect from from this year or what what
[07:12] we have already accomplished like we are
[07:14] in April? Mhm. I mean, as much as much
[07:18] as I don't like uh nation states or or
[07:21] politicians um buying, having, holding
[07:24] or talking about Bitcoin in general
[07:26] because it's it's freedom technology.
[07:30] Um there sure is a little bit of of of
[07:34] envy um looking towards the the
[07:36] Americans. I think 2025 will be the year
[07:39] where maybe the the US u because of the
[07:43] the reserve talks but maybe also other
[07:46] nation states
[07:47] will clearly position themselves towards
[07:50] Bitcoin like not not just with the
[07:52] current holdings but maybe uh announcing
[07:55] uh additional reserves or announcing
[07:57] maybe even um repricing their gold
[08:00] reserves and and switching some of of of
[08:02] it to to Bitcoin. And this will I think
[08:06] in 2025 we might see a big geopolitical
[08:10] shift towards Bitcoin. The Overton
[08:13] window will uh go even further towards
[08:16] uh Bitcoin being a legitimate asset. Um
[08:20] in 2024 the Overton window shift has
[08:23] already been extremely fast and I think
[08:26] in 2025 this will get even even more
[08:29] extreme. And unfortunately, I think um
[08:33] there will be some states that position
[08:36] themselves in favor, but there will be a
[08:39] lot of states and I'm pretty sure the
[08:42] the the uh the EU itself and all its
[08:46] member states will position position
[08:48] themselves against uh
[08:51] Bitcoin. The the past years have shown
[08:54] us that that they tend towards central
[08:57] centralization very heavily. um and
[09:00] think of Trump whatever you want, but
[09:02] you could argue he's at least a little
[09:06] bit more free market than uh than for
[09:09] example the Biden administration was. Um
[09:12] and the trend in the EU EU is going
[09:15] towards less free market, more
[09:17] centralization, more control, uh more
[09:19] capital controls. Um and that's why I
[09:22] think there will be a a huge uh shift in
[09:26] in politics in geopolitics and um what I
[09:30] do not really see is that the countries
[09:33] where you you and I we both live um will
[09:37] be at the front of innovation and
[09:40] understanding Bitcoin and understanding
[09:42] it as a um monetary asset to to save
[09:49] wealth to
[09:51] um to just um
[09:54] bring to just freeze freeze the energy
[09:58] you you you you could you could uh hold
[10:01] with your work and and and bring it to
[10:03] the future, you know. Um this is I think
[10:05] this is pretty sad. Um and I don't think
[10:07] we have any chance here by just um I
[10:10] don't know writing letters to
[10:12] politicians and and stuff. Um, I'm
[10:14] afraid the EU has to learn this the hard
[10:17] way and this will be the only way to
[10:19] make an economic and individual liberty
[10:23] 180. Let's say this is what you just
[10:27] said in the beginning was super
[10:28] interesting because I'm myself also I'm
[10:31] not a big fan of nations buying Bitcoin
[10:34] which is the hard stance to to have
[10:37] in5 and when when there's so much nation
[10:40] states cheering going on and it's it's
[10:42] it's really hard because on the one hand
[10:45] obviously Bitcoin is permissionless it's
[10:47] for everyone uh as Jeff Bof says like
[10:49] the the worst thing about Bitcoin is
[10:51] that your enemies can do it also.
[10:54] But at the same time we want freedom. We
[10:57] want we we want less state. We want more
[11:00] individuals. So the the further out we
[11:03] go without nation states uh the better
[11:06] it probably is. And then on the second
[11:08] side of it, you don't want nations to
[11:11] buy but you want your but you want your
[11:14] own nations to to buy it early as the
[11:16] other nations. Yeah. Yeah. Look, the
[11:18] thing is um uh game theory says there
[11:21] will be nations adopting Bitcoin, right?
[11:24] I I mean Bitcoin is for for enemies as
[11:26] you said.
[11:27] So if this game theory is set and clear
[11:31] and I mean at we've talked about this I
[11:33] don't know four to five years ago and
[11:35] and now really happens. Um but if it's
[11:38] clear that it happens um the choice is
[11:41] obvious if you want to live in a state
[11:44] that at least appreciates Bitcoin in a
[11:47] way even if you don't like them buying
[11:49] it for their reserves. Yeah, I I get
[11:51] that. That's totally my opinion. But the
[11:54] least thing you want to have is being in
[11:56] a state that doesn't not appreciate
[11:59] Bitcoin at all. Uh thinks it's black
[12:01] market illegal black market money. Um
[12:04] and doesn't own Bitcoin themselves going
[12:07] in a future where obviously Bitcoin
[12:09] becomes the global store of value
[12:12] reserve asset. Um then this just means
[12:16] for your jurisdiction you will go you
[12:19] will have a bad economy. you will go
[12:21] down in probably one day hyperinflation.
[12:24] Um, you will trend towards a high time
[12:28] preference society. Yeah, I'd say high
[12:31] time preference is some some kind of the
[12:34] the mental end result of inflationary
[12:37] money. And uh you can be in a society
[12:41] trending towards that or you can be in a
[12:44] society trending towards maybe a little
[12:47] more individual freedom, a little more
[12:49] economic freedom. um um and therefore
[12:52] may more more prosperity in general.
[12:56] That's I mean game theory is a [ __ ]
[12:58] regarding that, right? Um, I think you
[13:01] can hate nation states adopting Bitcoin
[13:06] and at the same same time just logically
[13:09] say uh um and and I have have the point
[13:12] that if you have the choice, you'd
[13:15] rather be in a state being pro Bitcoin
[13:17] than in a in a state being pro fiat and
[13:20] and trying to prohibit Bitcoin or or or
[13:23] I don't know, put Bitcoiners in jail. Um
[13:26] and
[13:28] I what I mostly get as answer when I'm
[13:31] saying this is yeah but I'd love to be
[13:33] in a state that doesn't want any Bitcoin
[13:36] doesn't hold any Bitcoin but just lets
[13:38] me act freely and lets me um I don't
[13:41] know buy and sell and transact my
[13:43] Bitcoin taxfree and I say like that's
[13:46] not going to
[13:48] happen. Why why should anyone do this?
[13:50] Maybe if if the Argentinians are lucky,
[13:52] maybe Malay is is is bringing up such a
[13:55] legislation. That's possible. But I I
[13:57] really don't see that in the EU or or in
[14:00] Germany.
[14:02] Um we've come too far in centralization
[14:05] and in bureaucratic overhead um that I
[14:09] see any possibility for them to to make
[14:11] the U-turn and say, "Okay, let's go
[14:13] towards free markets and pro prosperity
[14:15] now." I I just don't see that to be
[14:16] honest. Do you? Absolutely not. And it's
[14:19] a really good point. I've never heard
[14:21] someone say that because you either have
[14:24] a nation state, a government that says,
[14:26] "Oh, we love Bitcoin. We we like Bitcoin
[14:29] to prosper in our country," then they
[14:32] will obviously buy it. Like if if if you
[14:34] understand Bitcoin and you want Bitcoin
[14:37] to prosper in your country, it would be
[14:39] almost foolish not to buy it. And the
[14:43] other side is we don't want Bitcoin and
[14:47] we don't care for it. And at the same
[14:49] time, you see how that crowd that
[14:51] embraces Bitcoin gets stronger and
[14:54] bigger.
[14:55] You really have to work against that.
[14:57] Otherwise, you as a government and those
[14:59] are individuals will get pressed out of
[15:01] it. So, you either fight against Bitcoin
[15:03] or you embrace Bitcoin. As it gets
[15:06] bigger, more and more people, more and
[15:07] more nation states will embrace it. So
[15:10] it's it's almost an impossible state
[15:12] where the state will leave you alone
[15:15] with your Bitcoin and you can do
[15:16] whatever you want with it and they don't
[15:19] have Bitcoin. Like that's an impossible
[15:21] state to be. Yeah. I mean I mean there's
[15:23] one state um and and that's what I meant
[15:26] if if you really get an anarch
[15:29] capitalist government that says like
[15:31] okay let's see we will shrink as much as
[15:34] possible. We don't want to hold anything
[15:36] as a state. Um no problem. We we we'll
[15:39] shrink. we just want I don't know 1% of
[15:41] your income as a tax or whatever or a
[15:43] fixed fee. um then that might be
[15:45] possible like if if the state then says
[15:49] look we are just having this and this
[15:51] and that task as a state and not more we
[15:54] don't need to hold any reserve assets
[15:56] I'd love that of course maybe MLE is
[15:59] doing something like that in the future
[16:00] in Argentina I don't know never trust a
[16:03] politician um but I just don't see it
[16:05] for for where we live it's just in my
[16:08] opinion it's like delusional that any
[16:10] modern western state that is balls deep
[16:13] in fiat
[16:14] in in the fiat game um will will take
[16:17] this position. So, and therefore, as you
[16:20] said, I just see these two positions you
[16:23] just you just mentioned as as a likely
[16:25] outcome. Um and and then it doesn't
[16:28] matter what the position would be that
[16:30] I'd wish for if it's just absolutely
[16:32] unrealistic. Are you in the camp like
[16:35] there there are two camps when it comes
[16:37] to fiat currencies and and Bitcoin
[16:39] within Bitcoin? The one is like yeah we
[16:42] will probably always have some sort of
[16:44] government token some sort of fiat
[16:45] currency even like 100 200 years in and
[16:48] then the other camp they says oh bitcoin
[16:51] will destroy fiat then there's like a
[16:53] lot of nuance to it of like will it do
[16:55] it in 3 years I think the most most
[16:58] aggressive was 3 years which was a year
[17:00] ago so it should be in two years uh and
[17:03] then they're like okay maybe 10 years
[17:05] maybe 50 years maybe 100 years down the
[17:06] road there's no fear anymore um Where
[17:10] where are you more of like there will
[17:12] always be a fiat government token in in
[17:14] some sense to pay taxes and stuff like
[17:16] that or this will not make sense with
[17:18] Bitcoin? That's a that's a tough one. I
[17:21] mean none of us knows knows the future.
[17:24] Um what I think is that maybe in a in a
[17:28] far distant future I don't know there
[17:29] will be countries
[17:31] just setting on Bitcoin like they won't
[17:36] explicitly say you have to pay
[17:37] everything in Bitcoin. I think they will
[17:38] be very free market and say you decide
[17:40] upon yourselves and then as we think uh
[17:43] bitcoin is the most likely outcome as a
[17:45] as a money. Um, I think this will exist
[17:49] and I think for a pretty long time a lot
[17:52] lots of other countries will pre-exist
[17:56] acknowledging Bitcoin and maybe even
[17:58] appreciating it but still having their
[18:00] fiat currency because they just um they
[18:03] just don't want to lose the power of um
[18:06] stealing others purchasing power. I
[18:09] mean, that's I'd say that's the the most
[18:12] powerful weapon uh on earth that we have
[18:15] because most people don't even
[18:16] understand it. It's it it's the the
[18:19] perfect
[18:20] theft. Um so, lots of nations will
[18:24] really try to pre prevent giving up on
[18:27] that. But in in the real long run and I
[18:31] don't know what this means might be 50
[18:32] might be 100 years um all societies the
[18:36] whole globe has to tend towards this
[18:39] because people will just um over the
[18:43] years see the difference between their
[18:45] country and countries um really just
[18:47] leaving it up to their citizens what
[18:49] what what money they use. They will see
[18:51] there will be less friction, there will
[18:52] be more more
[18:54] prosperity and stuff. And so I think
[18:58] um the the free market will will fix it
[19:02] towards that since we now have this
[19:04] incorruptible technology. Um the free
[19:07] market will bring it up as the number
[19:09] one monetary candidate. Um the only
[19:13] thing is I have no idea how long this uh
[19:15] can take and and how long um single
[19:18] nation states
[19:20] um will be successful in in trying to to
[19:23] prevent it. Yeah. I am
[19:26] already
[19:28] really I'm shocked how long this field
[19:31] game already works. When you think about
[19:34] it, if you really understand what fear
[19:37] is, you understand that there's someone
[19:40] else stealing from you and then you see
[19:44] that most people saving in that very
[19:47] thing and support that very thing. How
[19:51] is that still possible after 50 years?
[19:53] So like like I mean the you can go
[19:56] further back the inflationary monetary
[19:59] system, but like let's let's stick with
[20:00] the 50 years of of the US dollar since
[20:03] 1971. Well, that's already 54 years. I'm
[20:06] probably saying 50 years, but yeah, it's
[20:08] it's it's kind of amazing that this
[20:10] thing is still going on. Yeah, I I just
[20:14] can't get can't like wrap my brain
[20:17] around how how this we we we've been on
[20:21] a gold standard and they literally
[20:23] managed to to rugpull everyone in in in
[20:26] the world without anyone noticing or
[20:29] without the general public noticing.
[20:31] That's still something I I just can't
[20:33] grasp. Like my brain explodes every time
[20:36] I think about it. Someone just did the
[20:38] biggest rugpole uh in human history.
[20:41] Um,
[20:43] and everything just went on. The world
[20:46] just kept on turning. Nobody really
[20:49] cared.
[20:51] Um, and all, I don't know, 20 to 50
[20:54] years, uh, we learn again. Uh, a new new
[20:57] fiat currency will will go down and
[20:59] we'll find all kinds of explanations
[21:02] except for, um, centralized u, um, money
[21:07] creation, which is quite literally
[21:09] insane to me.
[21:12] There's always um when you look at the
[21:14] history of inventions, for example, the
[21:16] steam engine uh was was there for a long
[21:19] time before it was widely used because
[21:22] they figured out uh that I mean that's
[21:24] nerdy, but like the condenser has to be
[21:26] uh separate from where the thing is
[21:29] going. Uh so you can keep it hot and
[21:32] have it uh cool somewhere else. That's
[21:35] was a very shitty explanation, but
[21:38] but never mind. But but the point is
[21:41] that uh things can be a long time around
[21:45] and just get then one small adjustment
[21:47] and all of the sudden it has a wide use.
[21:50] And I think maybe gold was such an
[21:53] amazing
[21:54] thing but it then turned into hey how
[21:58] can we use it on a global scale? How can
[22:01] we transfer gold from from long
[22:04] distances? And how I think about it,
[22:07] maybe we needed Fiat to find Bitcoin.
[22:11] And Fiat is kind of the the Blu-ray.
[22:14] That that sounded really good, but all
[22:16] of a sudden it was like nobody used it
[22:18] anymore because the digital version came
[22:20] along. Wow. I I love that FIA is the
[22:23] Blu-ray. Totally agree. Um
[22:26] uh gold was literally killed by its one
[22:29] biggest flaw. Uh, and as you said, this
[22:31] was it wasn't not being digital, but it
[22:34] it
[22:35] was not being able to permissionlessly
[22:38] send around the globe, which as we know
[22:41] is only possible with a with a digital
[22:44] thing we know today. They they didn't
[22:46] know like years ago. Um, but that was
[22:49] the one thing that uh I
[22:51] think killed it and and made fiat
[22:54] possible. As we know, Fiat has been just
[22:57] paper gold. And then someone just sat
[23:00] there and thought, h, let's just let's
[23:03] just let's try this. And then they just
[23:06] rugpulled everyone and it just worked.
[23:08] And I think in let's say 250, maybe 500,
[23:13] maybe more, I don't know, years.
[23:15] Thankfully, fiat money will just be that
[23:19] one funny moment in history like where
[23:21] they look back and they just say, "Oh my
[23:24] gosh, they they didn't really try that,
[23:26] right?"
[23:27] um where we had like those 50 to 100
[23:30] years where where where we just
[23:32] completely derailed and and and didn't
[23:35] get that fiat money was not a good idea
[23:38] at all where people people will make fun
[23:40] of us like and then they gave the the
[23:43] money money money printing license to
[23:45] nation states like to to to politicians
[23:47] how how stupid is
[23:49] that and uh I think all of us you me and
[23:53] and everyone who who's calling
[23:54] themselves a Bitcoiner Today um we're
[23:58] helping in in in making this as fast as
[24:02] possible like
[24:03] this what we all try is is making fiat
[24:07] the historic uh the idiotic historic uh
[24:11] anomaly of of of monies. I'd
[24:13] say if this is becoming true I think we
[24:17] were we were quite successful.
[24:21] This this is so because there's like
[24:23] this this theory and and I mostly got it
[24:26] from from Sailor that you you shouldn't
[24:28] hate on things, you should uh love on
[24:30] other things. But sometimes you really
[24:33] have to make people aware how bad fear
[24:37] is for them to even notice how good
[24:40] Bitcoin is. for someone that thinks fiat
[24:43] is
[24:44] good, they they will they're not ready
[24:47] to understand uh Bitcoin yet. So that
[24:53] I'm I'm struggling with with that
[24:54] because I I don't want to always I don't
[24:57] want to fall in the category of the the
[24:59] gold bucks where you always don't fear
[25:02] then you're like the crash is coming
[25:04] right away and like no like the crash
[25:07] probably doesn't come like next week. It
[25:09] will take a long time. It's like a
[25:12] really big boat. It's a really big
[25:13] Titanic and it sinks very slowly if it
[25:16] sinks at all. Uh so we we we have a long
[25:19] story. Uh and the network effect of fear
[25:22] is also sometimes I think
[25:23] underestimated. We we talk about network
[25:26] effects in in social medias where
[25:28] Facebook uh is is still the biggest
[25:30] social media. Now they they bought other
[25:32] social medias to to make it even bigger.
[25:35] But fiat also is a basically an an a
[25:38] social currency that lifts from how many
[25:41] people are in it. And the more people
[25:43] are in it that the value goes up from
[25:44] that. So the network effect of that
[25:47] turning down is super super hard. And
[25:50] even bitcoiners like us I I don't know
[25:52] about you but I still use fiat almost on
[25:55] a daily basis because it's just not it's
[25:58] just not working otherwise. you really
[26:00] have to uh jump through a lot of hoops
[26:02] to get to a full Bitcoin standard and
[26:06] not touch fiat anymore. I'm only I have
[26:08] now an income stream that is purely in
[26:10] Bitcoin and an expenses stream that's
[26:13] purely in Bitcoin where there's like a
[26:15] line a cash flow that's just staying in
[26:18] Bitcoin all the time from I get it to I
[26:21] spend it again which is absolutely
[26:24] amazing and it's growing but there's
[26:27] still a lot of fear in in my cash flow.
[26:30] So, I think it's just yeah, I I don't
[26:33] really have a point or question with
[26:34] that, but it's it's it's really um uh
[26:38] mind-blowing how how strong that fear
[26:40] network is and and how hard it is to get
[26:43] to get away from from that. Absolutely.
[26:46] That's that's what I meant by by it's
[26:48] this genius kind kind of of theft,
[26:51] right? I mean, every monetary system at
[26:54] the end is a system of belief. Of
[26:56] course, if you have a free market,
[26:58] people will choose the best money
[27:00] because of its properties. But still, at
[27:02] the end of the day, every money is just
[27:04] a system of trust and and and and and
[27:07] belief. If enough people think a good
[27:10] that is just a monetary good is
[27:12] valuable, then it is. If suddenly
[27:15] everyone changes uh um changes his his
[27:18] and her opinion, then this will just
[27:21] change. I think this is uh as well why
[27:24] hyperinflation can happen.
[27:26] Hyperinflation in the end stadium with a
[27:28] fiat currency is not because suddenly
[27:32] there there are such excessive unit
[27:35] numbers of the money but because trust
[27:37] completely gets lost and that's that
[27:39] that's why nobody values the money
[27:42] itself anymore and that's why the the
[27:44] the price of money suddenly
[27:45] hyperinflates and and you can't pay
[27:47] anything um with it. And and the the
[27:50] genius thing about genius thing about
[27:53] inflation is that just too few people
[27:57] get what it really is because you have
[27:59] uh one or two economic theories that
[28:01] just say it's it's necessary and and
[28:03] it's okay.
[28:05] Um but like talking about being
[28:08] democratic and and transparent and and
[28:11] fair which which all western democracies
[28:14] claim they are. I don't know of any
[28:16] constitution or or basic law or state
[28:19] law that even explains
[28:23] that inflation or the the the state's
[28:26] right to to to create money is some kind
[28:28] of tax or theft. Like nobody
[28:30] transparently um talks about this. It's
[28:34] just I mean it's not really a secret
[28:36] because with basic logic you can
[28:38] understand it but but on on on I'd say
[28:42] rule of law and stuff it's just a secret
[28:45] nobody talks about it's it's the the
[28:47] hidden tax nobody nobody talks about
[28:49] that that is listed nowhere in in in any
[28:52] statistics on uh I don't know how how
[28:55] big is the tax burden in different
[28:57] European countries you never see like
[28:59] what was what was the um money supply
[29:03] growth over over the years. And that's
[29:06] what I think is um like the big lie we
[29:11] all live up to. um and and and not
[29:15] enough people talk about and that's why
[29:17] I cannot totally agree with Sailor by
[29:21] the way who whom I think is in the
[29:23] position partly where he has to say this
[29:26] because otherwise his agenda of like US
[29:30] politicians adopting Bitcoin won't work
[29:32] like if you go to them just just by
[29:34] saying uh hey guys we will lose uh our
[29:39] global money printing license um and
[29:41] this will be the new asset let's just
[29:42] kill the dollar and and this thing is
[29:44] way better, you you won't be successful
[29:47] at all. I think the the pitch has to be
[29:49] a little smarter um at at these levels.
[29:54] Um but but but I I I can't agree with
[29:58] him here like fiat really is an evil
[30:00] thing. Like most people promoting fiat
[30:04] maybe don't understand it or don't know
[30:06] what they pro promote but in its core
[30:08] it's just evil and it's immoral because
[30:12] um as I said no one clearly and
[30:15] transparently
[30:17] um
[30:18] articulates that it just steals from
[30:20] you. That's and that's that's just not
[30:22] fair. And the US is in such a unique
[30:24] position because if they really figure
[30:27] Bitcoin out and if they really start
[30:30] aggressively buying Bitcoin now, maybe
[30:34] even already started and not telling
[30:35] people because uh it's it would be a
[30:37] foolish thing to tell people before you
[30:39] buy the price shoots up. So I would buy
[30:42] without telling people. They can really
[30:46] prolong their fiat power as long as
[30:49] possible. And maybe the US dollar is
[30:52] then the longest standing fiat
[30:55] currencies where all other fiat
[30:56] currencies are dying because they also
[30:58] have a huge gold reserve. They also have
[31:01] a huge Bitcoin reserve. They also have
[31:02] other strategic reserves. Um with with
[31:06] that it's it's super interesting how
[31:10] this pitch could go go to Trump because
[31:14] he he like make America great again like
[31:16] let's America should be the world power.
[31:20] this is the only way if if if you really
[31:22] think about they have to aggressively
[31:24] and secretly buy Bitcoin right now.
[31:27] Absolutely. and and and I think we both
[31:29] are saying this without cheering for the
[31:32] US or or any other state uh to do this,
[31:35] but just in analyzing the the incentives
[31:37] and and and the game theory and I mean
[31:40] I've I've been saying this for for years
[31:43] um a possible outcome or possible theory
[31:46] is that hope hopefully it like not
[31:50] hopefully this happening but hopefully
[31:52] the the last one happening. Um, I think
[31:54] it could really be that the US is the
[31:57] last world superpower existing because
[32:00] like I I if they adopt Bitcoin, they
[32:04] will they will have so much capital that
[32:07] they can at least for other 50 to 100
[32:11] years
[32:12] um let's say finance their lifestyle and
[32:15] their position in the world um until if
[32:19] if the world adopts Bitcoin until it
[32:22] slowly erodess Because as we both know a
[32:26] a a state will never be uh will never be
[32:29] a profitable business or profitable
[32:31] service service. They always spend more
[32:33] money than they than they get. And if
[32:36] you and you will have to in the long
[32:38] run, I guess if you give up on the
[32:40] monopoly of money creation, um one day
[32:44] you will have no no Bitcoin savings left
[32:46] even as a a nation state. Um and that's
[32:50] why I think if you are the US
[32:53] Again, that's not something I wish for
[32:55] and I I I want to promote. But if you
[32:57] are the US and you want to stay in the
[33:01] position you are right now being the
[33:02] superpower um and maybe being the last
[33:06] big
[33:07] superpower if Bitcoin is what we both
[33:10] think it is and lots of other people
[33:12] think it is um you have to accumulate as
[33:16] much Bitcoin as possible and then you
[33:17] can stay the world superpower for as
[33:22] long as you as you still have have your
[33:25] Bitcoin holdings and after that I would
[33:27] hope the world will fall apart into I
[33:31] don't know thousands of small countries
[33:33] um being in a free market competition.
[33:36] Um
[33:37] uh I hope there would and will be way
[33:40] less huge and big wars uh just just
[33:43] because
[33:45] um a hard money system as Bitcoin makes
[33:48] uh cooperation always the better,
[33:52] cheaper and more efficient alternative
[33:54] to to corruption.
[33:56] um which I hope will even be true on
[33:59] nation state level. It is on an
[34:01] individual level I'd say. Um and yeah, I
[34:04] I think this might be one of the
[34:06] possible outcomes. The US being the last
[34:08] um the world's last big
[34:12] um imperial superpower and after that uh
[34:16] hopefully um a thousand golden years or
[34:19] so or a thousand orange years I should
[34:21] say. Let's take a break for a moment and
[34:24] appreciate the beauty that coin
[34:26] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[34:29] watches. Those watches are the most
[34:31] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[34:34] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner
[34:37] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[34:39] completely new and amazing Genesis
[34:42] edition of their watch collections. You
[34:45] have the date of the first ever mined
[34:48] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[34:50] also the block height and which epoch we
[34:53] are currently in. I love the level of
[34:56] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[34:59] Make sure to check out those amazing
[35:01] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[35:04] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[35:07] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[35:10] really do hope that you don't have it on
[35:12] exchange. But if you do have it on
[35:14] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[35:16] deal with that. The first way is you put
[35:18] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[35:20] entry for you to get into the
[35:23] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[35:26] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[35:29] super simple and secure way. And if you
[35:32] check out the link in the description,
[35:34] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[35:37] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[35:40] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[35:43] partner in terms of how to get the most
[35:46] out of your sovereignty. They will
[35:48] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[35:51] that is perfect for your individual
[35:54] situation. They will show you how you
[35:57] can secure your own devices. Securing
[35:59] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[36:01] have to keep all your devices secure.
[36:04] One topic that is overlooked often is
[36:06] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[36:09] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[36:12] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[36:14] place already? And last but not least,
[36:16] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[36:18] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[36:21] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[36:26] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:29] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:31] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:34] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:37] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:39] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:41] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:44] the link down in the description of
[36:46] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:48] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:52] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:54] there. Thousand orange. I just want to
[36:56] bring that up because I just thought
[36:58] about that. you probably are aware of of
[37:00] the Radalio's principles of changing the
[37:03] world order. Yeah. And this is the
[37:06] original one from Radalio. Uh the the
[37:09] theory is around for for for quite some
[37:11] time now. It's probably like some years
[37:13] old already where the China is actually
[37:15] coming up and the US is falling down.
[37:17] Absolutely. And the thing is uh just
[37:21] here that that was I posted it once.
[37:23] Yeah. That's so funny. and and you and
[37:26] you're basically saying that that the US
[37:28] is now on the downward trajectory of
[37:31] being a world
[37:33] superpower and not not China is coming
[37:35] up but actually Bitcoin is coming up and
[37:38] decentralizing nations.
[37:40] I mean, I absolutely agree that China is
[37:43] coming up and that they would be the
[37:45] next superpower, but then uh I think
[37:47] when I uh posted this graphic, I just
[37:51] there was just a a a line going straight
[37:54] up in orange, there was Bitcoin, it was
[37:56] just like crashing the party. Like
[37:58] there's the US coming down, um China
[38:01] coming up, and then there just bang,
[38:02] Bitcoin. Uh all of your models
[38:04] destroyed, as we love to say as
[38:06] Bitcoiners.
[38:07] Um, maybe that's just what I wish for,
[38:10] but I also think it's not so unlikely
[38:13] um on on a a a game theory perspective.
[38:18] And then we come to something really
[38:19] interesting. I I I saw one video of I
[38:22] forgot which one may maybe it was with
[38:24] Nico or with with Roman where you was
[38:28] where you were interviewed where you
[38:29] said that um you you said a 0% Bitcoin
[38:33] allocation means that you think that
[38:35] Bitcoin uh you're basically betting
[38:37] against Bitcoin and you think Bitcoin is
[38:39] going to die somewhere along those
[38:41] lines. you said it which was like that's
[38:44] so powerful the orange peel people if
[38:46] you make if you make them aware because
[38:48] I see some people saying like hey uh I
[38:51] don't want to deal with investing I
[38:53] don't want to deal with Bitcoin because
[38:55] it's very risky they don't realize by
[38:59] not making a decision towards Bitcoin
[39:01] they're making a decision against
[39:03] Bitcoin unintentionally they they just
[39:06] don't make any decision but that's in a
[39:09] decision against Bitcoin absolutely yeah
[39:11] I I That's the the the um not so
[39:14] well-known concept and in my opinion
[39:16] very important concept of opportunity
[39:17] cost, right? Um the moment you say u um
[39:22] I have a 0% Bitcoin allocation, even if
[39:25] you've never heard of Bitcoin and
[39:27] therefore have a 0% allocation of
[39:29] Bitcoin, your signal to the market is I
[39:31] think this thing is going to die. And
[39:33] that's what you bet on. you think in the
[39:36] future this thing has to have zero value
[39:39] otherwise you'd have a smaller
[39:41] allocation and especially
[39:44] um we use this framework especially when
[39:47] when talking to high net worth
[39:48] individuals or or companies um because
[39:52] like if if someone has no no savings
[39:56] rate at all I mean what for would I tell
[39:59] them oh you have a 0% Bitcoin allocation
[40:02] you're betting against Bitcoin and
[40:03] they'll just answer bro, I'm I'm I'm I'm
[40:06] betting against myself. I I can't even
[40:08] save anything. And and then of course
[40:10] they they don't have the the headsp
[40:12] space to think about uh what their
[40:14] portfolio allocation is. But with
[40:17] companies that strive to survive over
[40:19] the coming years and with high net worth
[40:21] worth individuals that often don't want
[40:23] to uh make the highest returns but just
[40:26] want to manifest their purchasing power
[40:29] and and bring it uh to future
[40:32] generations just not losing it. Um that
[40:35] pitch is very powerful because it's just
[40:38] absolutely true. If in the year 2025
[40:42] where the world's superpower has
[40:44] announced a Bitcoin strategic reserve,
[40:46] you say, "I have a 0% allocation in my
[40:49] portfolio." That really is a decision. I
[40:52] mean, it it is not not just unknown
[40:55] opportunity cost anymore. It's if you're
[40:58] high net worth or if you're and you call
[41:00] yourself an investor or or a finance
[41:02] guy, it's it's just literally a decision
[41:07] um saying this thing is going to zero
[41:10] and if it's not um you are the one uh
[41:13] bearing the consequences and and and
[41:15] losing out. Uh, and even if I would hate
[41:19] Bitcoin, I think with with today's
[41:22] standing of Bitcoin, I would not have a
[41:24] 0% allocation. Would just be insanely
[41:27] dumb.
[41:29] Yeah, it's it's a question of like how
[41:31] many Bitcoin does Peter
[41:34] has to be honest. I often think he's
[41:37] he's he's play playing us a little. It's
[41:40] just an attention game. I think that guy
[41:42] has Bitcoin. Uh, and probably, I mean,
[41:45] he's he's pretty rich, I guess, and
[41:47] probably has more bit Bitcoin than a lot
[41:49] of uh other guys calling themselves
[41:52] Bitcoiners. He he probably has more
[41:54] Bitcoin than like 99% of Bitcoin
[41:57] Twitter. That's that's that's a hard
[41:59] truth, but but I think so as well. Yeah,
[42:02] it would be so fun if he once just like
[42:05] posts a public address of like, oh, like
[42:07] I own that one and it has like 20,000
[42:10] Bitcoin on there.
[42:12] I I I think this would be the day where
[42:15] Bitcoin Twitter would be like silent for
[42:17] 24 hours. They would like be no tweet
[42:19] and everybody would be they're like,
[42:20] "Oh, [ __ ] He just played us."
[42:24] The engagement he he how engaged farmed
[42:28] us. I don't know if that's a word. Uh
[42:30] but it is now. It is now. And this his
[42:34] son also was but yeah let's let's not
[42:36] contribute to his engagement farming.
[42:39] True. One thing that I really was
[42:42] interesting um I talked with Danny from
[42:45] Coin Corner and it was super
[42:47] interesting. We dived really deep into
[42:49] what this bull cycle is all about and we
[42:53] discovered basically that this bull
[42:56] cycle is really carried by institutions
[43:00] and by high net worth individuals and by
[43:03] uh people with deeper buckets and by
[43:06] people that already have been in
[43:07] Bitcoin. So a few things that we have
[43:09] seen is the people that buy Bitcoin now
[43:12] are buying more. So the the same
[43:16] addresses that bought Bitcoin in 2017
[43:18] where there's like hype that there was
[43:20] like a lot of people bought but only a
[43:21] small small amount. Now not a not as
[43:24] many buy but like a lot more. And when
[43:27] you see things like Google Trends for
[43:29] example, um we are at what was it I
[43:32] think 7% of where we were at from 2017
[43:37] and I think like 25% where we were from
[43:40] 2021. So like really down from uh those
[43:44] levels but the price is higher which is
[43:46] which is interesting and he basically
[43:48] said the bull market for retail hasn't
[43:52] even started. We have seen a bull market
[43:54] in the price but retail for more and all
[43:57] the craziness never really happened this
[44:00] bull cycle and now I think you're
[44:02] working now for coinity for 2 3 years if
[44:06] I'm if I'm correct and and confinity is
[44:09] an interesting position because they
[44:10] have been around for so long um and they
[44:13] probably gathered data um uh for for for
[44:16] long and have have the insights. How do
[44:18] you look at this bull cycle uh versus
[44:22] 2017 2021?
[44:25] Mhm. Um I mean what I can say is
[44:28] that in the past months like especially
[44:32] the runup to over 100,000 in price. Um
[44:36] we've been growing as fast as we have
[44:38] I'd say never been before. That was
[44:40] really insane.
[44:42] Um but of course this was as well um
[44:46] through people already being Bitcoiners
[44:50] uh finding us and recognizing us as as a
[44:53] brand they they thought is new but but
[44:55] we have quite quite a a a long history.
[44:59] Um but I think there has been a small
[45:03] retail bull run already but I totally
[45:06] agree that uh we are nowhere compared to
[45:10] I don't know 2017 levels or so where it
[45:13] was like in in the news every day and
[45:15] everybody was freaking out. I think this
[45:18] could
[45:18] be upon us
[45:21] still. But what is also possible in my
[45:23] opinion is uh if like Trump's plans
[45:27] don't work out um and and and
[45:30] finding finding viable um tariff and
[45:34] economic solutions with the whole world
[45:37] again doesn't work out as planned by
[45:39] him.
[45:41] Um I think we could also like land in a
[45:45] total recession. um where Bitcoin gets
[45:48] hit as well. Um because I think still we
[45:52] are not at at the point where enough
[45:54] people understand in such a economic
[45:57] recession that Bitcoin is the safe haven
[46:00] um that price will show it like
[46:02] Bitcoiners will of course use Bitcoin as
[46:04] a safe haven but um if most of people
[46:08] don't do it um it will just brutally
[46:11] show in price. So I think those might be
[46:14] the the the two outcomes in the in the
[46:17] near future. Let's say
[46:20] 2025. Uh either retail bull run is is
[46:23] upon us or um uh somebody is cancelling
[46:27] the whole party because because the
[46:29] whole world has
[46:31] as bigger problems. Let's let's let's
[46:34] say it like that. Um and there I would
[46:36] like like just um differentiate
[46:40] between why in an economic recession um
[46:43] Bitcoin's price will drop much lower
[46:47] than it is
[46:49] now in 2025 versus in like 20 30 years
[46:53] because um if enough people understand
[46:55] what it is it will be their main savings
[46:59] tool. the more
[47:02] um the e economy is uncertain, the more
[47:05] they they will get into Bitcoin. Um but
[47:07] it's it it's just a a question of of
[47:10] of the adoption rate, you know. I mean,
[47:13] if if we're like at 20
[47:15] 30 or
[47:17] 40% world adoption of using Bitcoin,
[47:20] Bitcoin as a store of value, um it will
[47:23] be the only thing going up in a during a
[47:25] a recession, but we're just not there
[47:27] yet.
[47:29] I actually like uh bare markets. I
[47:32] actually like recessions. It it really
[47:35] shows like Okay, there's two things in
[47:37] in Bitcoin bare markets. You see who's
[47:40] really there for the long haul and who's
[47:42] really absolutely building something for
[47:44] the long haul in Bitcoin and who was
[47:47] just there for the bull market to
[47:48] capture some of the upside. Yeah. Yeah.
[47:50] Both with people that build in Bitcoin,
[47:53] make content in Bitcoin, but also those
[47:55] who buy Bitcoin. So like in all
[47:57] categories you see it, but also in in in
[48:00] bare markets outside of Bitcoin. So like
[48:02] in recessions, you see which businesses
[48:05] are actually profitable, which
[48:06] businesses are actually making sense in
[48:08] the market and you flood out those who
[48:10] who who don't make sense. So I'm
[48:11] actually a big fan of those events where
[48:15] reality comes back and we we are not
[48:18] living anymore in the dreamland. Yeah,
[48:20] in in general I am as well. The only
[48:22] problem is that um like the higher the
[48:27] fiat
[48:28] system, how do I say this? Uh pulled the
[48:32] ribbon up, the harder it it it crashes
[48:35] down. And um if it's a heavy recession,
[48:39] it it it doesn't just cost jobs, it it
[48:42] may cost lives, right? Um all just
[48:44] because of a highly manipulated, very
[48:47] volatile system.
[48:49] um literally standing on a house of
[48:52] cards um which hopefully um might be
[48:56] very different and I mean we've seen
[48:58] historically is very different on a
[49:00] solid um monetary basis like for example
[49:03] gold we have we have a lot of uh history
[49:06] there um where of course also jobs get
[49:10] lost and businesses die but they they
[49:13] don't just die and get lost all at once
[49:15] like with with one economic event they
[49:17] just die if they're not profitable. Um
[49:20] but also they do not survive like
[49:23] Volkswagen for 20 years although being
[49:26] not profitable at all. Um that this of
[49:28] course those are like
[49:29] um
[49:31] um market market interventions and
[49:35] anomalies that that really wouldn't
[49:38] exist in a in a hard hard monetary
[49:40] standard, I'd say. Yeah. It's it's
[49:43] that baseline of
[49:46] reality where you you don't have the the
[49:50] ups, but then also you don't have the
[49:52] downs that much. If if there's like a
[49:54] hard money standard where we don't
[49:55] inflate it and we don't spend as much as
[49:58] we possibly can to to please everyone uh
[50:01] no matter what what position you're in.
[50:04] If you're waking up from that, it's a
[50:07] it's a it's a hard fall. And one thing
[50:10] that I just want to mention from the
[50:12] previous thing I forgot uh was was the
[50:15] was the craziness in the bull market we
[50:17] usually have when you remember 2017 we
[50:19] had the ICOs the the [ __ ] coinery 2021
[50:23] was NFTTS it even captured me like I I
[50:25] was I was full on in in video games and
[50:28] and weird things. Yeah. I'm so I'm so
[50:31] happy that I got away from that. It was
[50:33] like I got orange in 2020. So 201 was
[50:37] logically my my my altcoin shitcoin
[50:39] phase uh went pure Bitcoin only in 2022.
[50:43] The we we haven't had this crazy I mean
[50:46] Micro Strategy is probably the the most
[50:48] craziness that we have in this cycle but
[50:51] it's a different story right it's
[50:53] actually company that makes sense and
[50:54] stuff like that. Yeah. Um I like Florian
[50:58] Bruce's perspective on that also a
[51:00] German uh Bitcoiner and and podcaster.
[51:03] Um and he says he thinks um this cycle
[51:08] is the last altcoin cycle because they
[51:11] went from we are the better Bitcoin to
[51:14] Bitcoin is cool but we do something else
[51:16] very good um
[51:20] to like you know web 3 smart contracts
[51:23] blah blah blah um that they went to yeah
[51:27] look it's just about art now with the
[51:29] NFT craze and now they're like being
[51:33] honest. Yeah. To just say in general
[51:35] they're being honest uh by saying,
[51:37] "Yeah, look, we we're just meme coins."
[51:39] Yeah. Just just trade me. I'm just a
[51:41] meme coin coin. You you might go
[51:43] bankrupt or you might do a 50x. Um let's
[51:47] see. Uh and the funny thing is that the
[51:51] the the the promise and I'm not speaking
[51:53] about specific coins here, right? Just
[51:55] the the the trends as you said, ICOs,
[51:58] NFTts, web 3, blah blah blah. um the the
[52:02] the the the narrative the the the the
[52:05] trend always um switched o over time and
[52:09] now it's kind of just being honest.
[52:12] Yeah. Look, we're just gambling
[52:14] technology. Gamble if you want to. And
[52:17] that's why I think it might be possible
[52:19] that um if we I if the bull run
[52:24] continues in 2025 and and we might see
[52:26] new Bitcoin highs that there might be
[52:29] one or two of those meme coins
[52:32] um flourishing let's say like like this
[52:35] but as soon as we enter bare market
[52:38] territory I think we might finally uh
[52:42] get get rid of them like uh I I think it
[52:45] might be possible that with the honest
[52:48] honest um narrative of of just saying
[52:51] look we are just here to gamble.
[52:54] Um the things might just die off because
[52:57] at if if at one point of time you just
[53:00] admitted that it that you don't make any
[53:02] sense and there's no like prosperous
[53:04] future in in in your project and it's
[53:06] really just about gambling.
[53:10] um it it will will just uh it will just
[53:13] go away I guess or or it will be so
[53:15] obviously um gambling that uh nobody
[53:19] will ever fall into this trap again. And
[53:22] I'd really hope for this um maybe here
[53:24] as well. I'm I'm just I'm just dreaming
[53:26] and and it might not be true, but of
[53:30] course I would hope for that because um
[53:32] the more fiat systems derail and and
[53:36] and walk towards centralization and
[53:39] hyperinflation, the more as I said,
[53:42] people get a high time preference and
[53:44] and and and try and like and want to
[53:46] gamble. Um and and therefore I would
[53:48] hope that uh that this last trend will
[53:52] just make them die off and then most
[53:54] people will I mean imagine how many
[53:57] people would already have ended up on
[53:59] Bitcoin if they wouldn't get distracted
[54:01] by uh ICOs, NFTs, blah blah blah. And
[54:05] now uh the memecoin that that makes you
[54:08] rich overnight.
[54:10] It's a it's a powerful uh thing. By the
[54:13] way, for the people, um, Floren Bruce,
[54:16] uh, was on my channel. Uh, it was
[54:20] awesome to talk with him. Uh, and it was
[54:22] also very popular episode for for people
[54:25] that that might want to have a a second
[54:27] listen after that. Uh, it it was really
[54:30] cool. And I just see Mark from from the
[54:32] Bitcoin Hotel. I I without noticing, I
[54:34] stole his
[54:36] thumbnail. I have I I have a different a
[54:40] little bit different title so it still
[54:41] counts I guess. I hope so. But yeah,
[54:44] like u Bruce is really pretty really
[54:46] pretty really pretty really pretty
[54:46] really pretty really pretty really
[54:46] pretty really pretty really pretty
[54:46] really pretty really pretty really
[54:46] pretty really pretty really pretty
[54:46] really pretty really really really cool.
[54:47] I think I think we went with with Bruce
[54:50] in our podcast with the name as you said
[54:52] it's it's it's easier for for English
[54:54] people Bruce and Florian but it's like
[54:56] Bruce
[54:58] it's uh really really cool. Um, one
[55:00] thing that I'm always always curious,
[55:02] especially with pe people that are
[55:04] really entrenched in the community and
[55:05] and working in Bitcoin, uh, like you do,
[55:08] how has Bitcoin impacted your life or or
[55:11] changed you? That's a good one. Um, I
[55:13] mean, what what a lot of Bitcoiners or
[55:17] folks say and and most people often
[55:20] don't believe it, but I can guarantee
[55:22] you it really happened that
[55:24] Bitcoin
[55:25] dramatically like lowered my time time
[55:28] preference. Um I really um it's just a
[55:33] different feeling if if there is a
[55:37] savings tool you can look look forward
[55:41] to like you get excited when saving
[55:44] because not for the short term but but
[55:47] but you know uh the energy I'm now
[55:50] conserving with this asset um I
[55:53] can at least keep it uh and and and and
[55:57] and get it back and then maybe buy
[55:59] something with it in 4 years, 5 years,
[56:02] 10 years, 20 years, 50 years. Um, and
[56:05] that just makes you feel excited for for
[56:08] saving and it makes you
[56:11] um think about the long-term
[56:14] consequences of your life choices more,
[56:16] I'd say. Um
[56:19] you it it it made me um think way more
[56:23] about um starting a family, um buying
[56:28] aka building a home and stuff, things
[56:30] that that that are big big goals, but
[56:33] big goals that have a a
[56:36] a long distance time
[56:38] horizon. Um that's what it what it made
[56:42] with me before Bitcoin. I I was somehow
[56:46] interested in geopolitics and I started
[56:47] to understanding the fiat system but
[56:49] there has never been anyone or anything
[56:52] like proposing a good solution. Um even
[56:56] the solution of the most state critical
[56:57] guys has always been we need more
[56:59] regulations to prevent I don't know
[57:02] billionaires from becoming billionaires
[57:04] and there was a time in my life where I
[57:06] believed that.
[57:08] Um
[57:09] um but Bitcoin has has taught me where
[57:13] where the where the problem really is.
[57:16] And also it has taught me to to just um
[57:20] be
[57:22] um to just take it in my own hands like
[57:26] like
[57:27] uh I am the only one who can change my
[57:31] fate, who can change where my life ends.
[57:33] Um and you have to do and give
[57:35] everything uh for it. uh you have to
[57:37] work hard, you have to build up things.
[57:40] Um you can always just nag and say but
[57:45] but but but the field system is so
[57:46] unfair and and and and the state is so
[57:49] destructive and blah blah blah. Still,
[57:51] you are the one um having your fate in
[57:55] your hands and I think that is what
[57:58] Bitcoin taught me somehow. Before
[58:00] Bitcoin, I
[58:01] was in Germany, you would say a consume
[58:04] opera, like
[58:05] a consuming all day. I don't know. I've
[58:09] I think I I bought a new pair of
[58:12] sneakers like every month. Uh I wanted
[58:14] to have a cool car, blah blah blah blah
[58:16] blah.
[58:18] You know, like those first years where
[58:20] where you start earning money and think
[58:21] you're you're the king of the world and
[58:23] and you just want to I don't know if
[58:25] it's impressing others or yourself. um
[58:28] or if it's just um
[58:31] um I don't know trying to be someone
[58:34] you're not. Um uh but Bitcoin taught me
[58:37] how important savings is, how important
[58:40] um planning the future is and and and
[58:44] and of course often in your life,
[58:47] especially with with family and loved
[58:48] ones, you should be in the moment. Um no
[58:52] question about that. You should enjoy
[58:53] the moment. Uh, but I don't think you
[58:56] should get
[58:58] um your your your plans and your your
[59:00] your future out of this equation. And
[59:04] and that's what Bitcoin taught me, I'd
[59:05] say. Awesome. I love that. Sneakers
[59:10] every month. Wow, that's a lot. Like
[59:12] that was just a stupid example, but I
[59:15] don't know. I don't know if you can
[59:16] relate to this. Maybe you just skipped
[59:18] that. You're you're a little younger
[59:19] than I am, I guess. But when I was in my
[59:21] early 20s, I was just just like, "What?
[59:24] There's so much money coming onto my
[59:26] bank account every month. Awesome. I
[59:28] just do whatever the [ __ ] I want." And
[59:30] and like I don't know, when I was 26,
[59:32] 27, I was just like, "What the [ __ ] am I
[59:35] doing here? That doesn't make any
[59:36] sense." But I I don't really regret it
[59:40] because I think I needed those years of
[59:42] of
[59:43] being of of consumerism to to just re
[59:46] realize how how stupid it was. I have
[59:51] um it's it's super interesting when you
[59:55] because I never had that phase where I
[59:58] consumed a lot but I made one big
[60:02] purchase that I regret but also not
[60:04] regret. Um so from the age of like I
[60:10] always saved I I remember when I was in
[60:12] school my mom gave me I don't know maybe
[60:15] four or five for lunch with me. So it
[60:19] was like my lunch money. I always took
[60:21] like one two years out of it. Like
[60:22] literally I like I I always was a saver
[60:26] whole my life. That's that's the only
[60:28] that's one thing that Bitcoin didn't
[60:30] bring to me that I see Bitcoin brings to
[60:33] a lot of people because always a saver.
[60:36] But then there was this one weird moment
[60:40] where I got into investing and all of
[60:42] the sudden I got a lot of money because
[60:45] I invested in the right moment at in
[60:48] Tesla, in Facebook, in Apple, in all
[60:50] those tech stocks and within two years
[60:52] my net worth just grew so
[60:55] tremendously that my dream came very
[60:58] close. I always wanted to I was invested
[61:00] in Tesla. I wanted to have a Tesla. And
[61:02] I remember there was like this moment
[61:05] one year where I I even made a post
[61:08] about it on Instagram uh back in the day
[61:11] where I said like, "Oh, I I wish I could
[61:13] uh own a Tesla." And I went to the
[61:15] dealership and just like sat in it and
[61:16] stuff like that. One year later, the
[61:18] stock market blew up and I actually
[61:20] could afford one. And I actually sold
[61:22] all my Tesla stock and bought a Tesla
[61:24] and it was it was such a stupid
[61:27] decision. I regret that so much. But I
[61:30] also don't regret it because I learned a
[61:33] lot from that. First of all, that's what
[61:34] I meant. Yeah, exactly. You learn a lot
[61:36] from that. So after two months, 3
[61:39] months, the car is just a car. Like it
[61:42] it's it's fun the first two three months
[61:43] and then it's not fun anymore. It's just
[61:46] like a car. Then it becomes a
[61:47] convenience. Um and stuff like that. And
[61:51] I sold it afterwards. Uh now I don't
[61:54] have a car at all. Uh, and I live as
[61:56] minimalistic as as anyone can be, even
[61:58] though um I have a way better income
[62:00] than when I had the Tesla, which which
[62:02] is a funny thing. I look now way more
[62:05] broke than than I did like five four
[62:08] five years ago. Yeah. So, there's some
[62:10] lessons in there. Uh, but some some
[62:13] people have to learn it the hard way
[62:14] like me with with buying a stupid thing
[62:16] and losing a lot of money. Absolutely.
[62:18] And and and just to maybe get a little
[62:20] more precise here,
[62:23] um what I'm like I wouldn't even say
[62:26] recommend, but what I'm talking about
[62:28] here is is not um taking your Bitcoin
[62:31] with you to the grave, right? It's just
[62:34] there are bigger things and way more
[62:37] important goals to financially reach and
[62:41] then consume um at a later stage of life
[62:46] than cars, sneakers, the the newest
[62:48] iPhone, the bigger TV, blah blah blah
[62:51] blah. there's just bigger things um
[62:54] creating way more I'd say happiness um
[62:59] than than those those little things that
[63:02] we we think make us happy but then as
[63:04] you said after a month the car is just a
[63:07] convenience and after a year it's just a
[63:09] liability and then you think oh it just
[63:12] loses value damn it what have I done
[63:15] yeah there's a big um a big difference
[63:18] between living a life and consumerism
[63:22] So the one thing is like Yeah, exactly.
[63:25] The one thing is like I just buy things
[63:27] to fill a void of of like I want to have
[63:30] enjoyment from that and the other thing
[63:33] is I want to enjoy life. For example, uh
[63:38] buying new sneakers every every month is
[63:40] definitely a consumerism thing. I have
[63:42] myself usually like one or two years and
[63:45] uh a thing of like enjoying life is hey
[63:49] I worked really hard. I can step down
[63:51] and can only work 20 hours a week or 10
[63:55] hours a week or 15 hours a week and
[63:57] spend more time with my family, spend
[63:59] more time with my friends because I have
[64:00] a Bitcoin stack that can support that
[64:02] lifestyle. They're enjoying life.
[64:05] Exactly. Or or or for example, I would
[64:08] never recommend someone um spending lots
[64:11] of money for good food. I would never
[64:13] say to them that's that's dumb. just
[64:15] save more money blah blah blah because
[64:17] what they do is having a low time
[64:18] preference on their health and body um
[64:21] you know and that I never call this
[64:24] consumerism consumerism if it's just
[64:26] about good quality um high quality foods
[64:31] um and and I think you you nailed it
[64:34] perfectly there's there's there's a big
[64:36] difference between like living and and
[64:39] and trying to living a a fulfilled and
[64:41] happy life and and and feiat consumerism
[64:45] What what do you like to spoil on? Like
[64:47] what are your your your things that you
[64:49] like to spend your Bitcoin on? But
[64:50] that's a good question. Um I mean
[64:53] although I'm I'm not super picky there,
[64:55] but but I I'd say good food is a thing.
[64:58] Um and and for me personally like one
[65:03] one big goal is although it is
[65:06] economically idiotic and I know that uh
[65:09] I love like Austrian economics and and
[65:12] understanding e economy but one big goal
[65:15] uh for sure for for me is uh building or
[65:18] having a home for your family. Um, I
[65:20] mean that's that's one one thing I'd
[65:23] offer a lot of
[65:26] um I don't know um in in in other forms
[65:30] wealth um I' I' I'd sacrifice for for
[65:33] having that
[65:35] uh wealth for for my family like having
[65:38] have I think having that home that is
[65:41] that is yours although in a field state
[65:43] it's not really yours but you know what
[65:45] you know what I mean um just enables a
[65:49] whole different level in in in in in
[65:52] building up your family and having that
[65:54] one spot that is yours that you can
[65:56] create the way you want. That is
[65:58] something I'd say is is is worth
[66:00] spending your Bitcoin on. Definitely.
[66:03] That is also
[66:04] something which will be really hard to
[66:07] resist when a small portion of your
[66:10] Bitcoin can all of a sudden buy you your
[66:13] dream home. Um that that's something I
[66:16] think a lot of Bitcoiners and I hear
[66:18] that a lot actually from Bitcoiners who
[66:20] want to say like I want to own my
[66:23] company, I want to own my home, and I
[66:26] want to own my Bitcoin. That that those
[66:28] are the three things basically I want to
[66:29] own all the rest of it. Like why should
[66:32] why should I own it? Yeah, you can also
[66:33] own your car and and you own your
[66:36] computer and stuff like that, but the
[66:38] big things that you want to own. Of
[66:39] course. Of course. And and I really
[66:41] align with that. Um um I totally get the
[66:44] mantra of um 100% Bitcoin only bitcoin
[66:48] it will be the best performing asset uh
[66:50] over the years and that's true but um I
[66:53] think an enjoyable life is not only
[66:56] about
[66:57] having everything you have in the best
[66:59] performing asset but also in like
[67:02] building a happy life uh building maybe
[67:05] a future for your family or future
[67:07] generations or or um enabling them to
[67:13] grow up in a thing on a in in a spot
[67:15] they they they can confidently call
[67:17] their home. Um yeah. Yeah. At the end of
[67:20] the day um money is a maybe the the most
[67:24] most important technology we have. Um
[67:27] but still it's just money. Yeah, that's
[67:31] very true. I have a thousand more
[67:33] questions. Uh but I think we're already
[67:35] over like 1 hour. So I'll start with the
[67:38] first entertain question which is always
[67:41] the same question for each guest and the
[67:42] question is what can we learn from you
[67:45] besides Bitcoin? That is a good one. I
[67:47] think um maybe not learning from me but
[67:50] learning from my example is um that you
[67:53] can
[67:55] um you can find your icky guy if you
[67:58] want to. You can find
[67:59] your dream job if you want to. I've uh
[68:03] studied uh mechanical engineering and
[68:06] I've been quite good at that. Um but it
[68:08] never fulfilled me and after I
[68:11] understood and found Bitcoin, I was so
[68:15] obsessed with it and with economics and
[68:17] with understanding it and with bringing
[68:20] Bitcoin to other people and making other
[68:22] people understand Bitcoin. Um that
[68:25] everything I wanted to achieve is
[68:27] um working in the space full-time. uh
[68:30] and after a couple of years I um totally
[68:35] managed to do that. Now I have applicia
[68:37] as a publishing company uh that is uh
[68:40] one of those foundations. I'm working
[68:43] for and with confinity which is another
[68:45] of those foundations.
[68:47] Um and uh this really like
[68:53] um forget money and salary and blah blah
[68:55] blah. this really improved my life so
[68:57] hard because uh the since I'm working
[69:01] full-time in Bitcoin, I didn't have one
[69:03] Monday where I said like, "Oh, [ __ ] I'm
[69:06] so pissed. Um I I really don't want to
[69:08] work today." I don't have that anymore.
[69:10] And I think this is one of the um one of
[69:14] the greatest achievements you can have.
[69:16] I don't know if if this lasts forever.
[69:18] Maybe in like 5 years I said like, "Oh,
[69:19] okay. I I I hate Mondays again." Maybe.
[69:22] Who knows? Who know who knows what the
[69:24] future will bring. Um but for now um I
[69:28] think I I couldn't be happier with the
[69:30] all over setup and and I'm absolutely
[69:33] not talking about money here.
[69:36] Oh man, I I I I love that. And um I
[69:40] don't know, you probably are aware of of
[69:42] that book. It's it's one book that I
[69:44] that I read that was was really cool and
[69:46] and and helped me in in my way to to the
[69:48] eeky guy. How to eeky guy. I think
[69:50] that's the one I I read. Are you aware
[69:53] of that book? Probably I mean I I'm
[69:56] aware of that the concept itself. I
[69:59] think stems from a book as as far as I
[70:01] know like from a Japanese guy I think.
[70:04] Um but actually I haven't read the book
[70:07] itself. I just heard about the concept
[70:09] and saw the you should know the the
[70:11] graphic that that shows the different
[70:14] circles and and and what spots your icky
[70:17] guy has to hit to make a living of it.
[70:19] Um, and I I've seen that graphic once
[70:22] and I was blown away and frustrated at
[70:25] the same time because I've seen it and
[70:26] it was so logical for me, but I thought
[70:30] I have no idea what that is for me. And
[70:33] then one day I realized it was Bitcoin
[70:35] and I realized that I don't know one or
[70:37] two years after having the first touch
[70:39] points with with Bitcoin, I realized,
[70:41] oh, I actually found my eeky guy. Um,
[70:44] interesting. How can I make it work? But
[70:46] the most frustrating thing was not
[70:48] knowing what it is. So and and if that
[70:50] book helps people find find it, I even
[70:54] without reading it, I can recommend you
[70:56] read it because bringing you near um or
[70:59] closer to to that uh eeky guy um has
[71:03] exponential effects on your life
[71:05] happiness. I'd say 100%. Uh it it
[71:08] definitely helped me and it it really
[71:10] gives perspective of not not only the
[71:14] how but uh the why it is so important uh
[71:18] on on on case studies on like real life
[71:20] examples of icky guy uh and also like um
[71:25] inspirations of how you could actually
[71:27] do it because there like oh you have a
[71:29] job that pays the bills and it's not
[71:31] easy to to go out from that. So, they're
[71:33] like really solid advice in there. Um,
[71:36] from the guy Tim
[71:39] Tamashiro, apparently. Yeah. Uh, I I I I
[71:43] only know that book. I just heard it on
[71:44] Audible. It was a really good book. Uh,
[71:46] I liked it. Really cool. We have an we
[71:49] have an Android team in the podcast
[71:50] where the previous guest is asking a
[71:52] question for the next guest without
[71:53] knowing who who the next guest is. Yeah.
[71:56] And the previous guest asked you the the
[71:58] question um who is the most
[72:01] thoughtprovoking Bitcoiner for you
[72:04] personally and as you are really
[72:07] entrenched in the German speaking uh
[72:09] area maybe it's it's uh it's interesting
[72:13] one guy in German from the German
[72:15] community and one guy from the English
[72:17] community. Um so uh yeah one guy uh for
[72:22] for for each one if if you have one. Do
[72:25] you mean thoughtprovoking in uh
[72:27] provoking uh thoughts in the general
[72:30] public or in provoking my thoughts?
[72:33] Uh for you personally I would say um I
[72:35] mean the question comes from the
[72:36] previous guest so I can only guess what
[72:38] he meant but I I would say for you
[72:40] personally. Oh that's a really really
[72:43] tough one. Um I don't know if I have one
[72:46] for the Germanspeaking audience. Maybe
[72:50] I'd need another minute for that. Um for
[72:53] the English speaking audience who always
[72:55] was very thoughtprovoking for me was uh
[72:58] Eric Voscll um who wrote cryptoeconomics
[73:02] and who has I'd say who is one of the
[73:06] best critiques of Bitcoin like he's a
[73:09] Bitcoiner himself but he has very valid
[73:12] critiques uh but as well has lots of
[73:16] critique that sounds valid but when
[73:18] looking closely in my opinion isn't
[73:22] Um, and so I think without having read
[73:25] his book, uh, to be honest, uh, just
[73:28] seeing on how and what he's arguing
[73:30] arguing on Twitter or on X, um, he has
[73:35] always been pretty thoughtprovoking and,
[73:38] um, I hate it and like that because I
[73:39] think that's that's what what we need.
[73:41] Um, the best Bitcoin critiques mostly
[73:44] are Bitcoiners. That's a funny thing.
[73:47] Um, yeah. So, I think it would be Eric.
[73:50] Um, in the German speaking space, who's
[73:54] the most thoughtprovoking? Couldn't
[73:56] really name name anyone. Uh, but but
[73:58] what I like in general um from
[74:00] Bitcoiners is challenging Bitcoiners
[74:04] narratives
[74:05] like kind of what what what we've done
[74:08] uh like a couple of minutes ago. Um
[74:11] yeah, is it that you should only have
[74:13] Bitcoin and never sell and never have
[74:15] anything else? Maybe it's not. Maybe
[74:17] that's not how you have a really
[74:19] enjoyable life at the end of the
[74:21] day. Um, yeah, I couldn't I couldn't
[74:24] name you anyone in in German. I'm sorry.
[74:27] Ne never never sell your Bitcoin but
[74:29] spend them.
[74:31] Exactly. Really cool. Thank you so much
[74:34] uh Fab for for for taking the time and
[74:36] also for being on. Uh before I let you
