[00:00] the coin mining is the secret energy
[00:02] resource that nobody realizes is the
[00:04] most important thing it's really hard to
[00:06] believe for me that there would be
[00:07] anything that could seriously damage
[00:09] this network or get in the way of it
[00:10] achieving its ultimate purpose that's
[00:12] the world changing mindbending
[00:14] philosophy questioning asset that you
[00:16] should be studying Bitcoin is going to
[00:18] lower the cost of energy for all it's
[00:20] really an example of of antifragility
[00:22] and invincibility it's one of our first
[00:25] kind of invincible assets to ever race
[00:27] the world Bitcoin mining is its own
[00:29] version of Al through this repeatable
[00:31] process of generating entropy you
[00:34] actually create the most impressive
[00:36] money in the world you turn raw energy
[00:38] into Bitcoin it's a profound Evolution
[00:41] for human freedom and prosperity Bitcoin
[00:43] mining is going to reshape our energy
[00:46] [Music]
[00:48] landscape Bitcoin mining is the secret
[00:51] energy resource that nobody realizes is
[00:54] the most important thing that is going
[00:57] on in our world today I I love that so
[00:59] much I I really want to just get started
[01:02] right away with that um first of all
[01:04] like like why are you so before we get
[01:07] into that topic why are you so
[01:08] passionate about Bitcoin mining uh and
[01:11] why did you pick Bitcoin mining out of
[01:13] that that topic pool that is so Broad in
[01:16] Bitcoin sure so I was first exposed to
[01:20] Bitcoin in 2015 uh one of my first few
[01:22] years in college I at the time you know
[01:26] was a coiner as well so I had an
[01:28] interest in ethereum and anything else
[01:30] that was coming out at the time I didn't
[01:32] fully appreciate you know how impactful
[01:34] Bitcoin itself was um in the the kind of
[01:37] sea of noise and I tried to get into
[01:40] mining almost immediately So within you
[01:43] know a few months of buying my first
[01:44] coins which sadly i' you know let go of
[01:47] far too quickly but within a few months
[01:49] of getting my first
[01:50] coins tried to get into a mining startup
[01:53] that was in Sweden and it was this
[01:56] company that offered you know I think at
[01:58] the time it was an S3
[02:00] that you got an S3 that was hosted in
[02:02] Sweden on hydr Power and I got payouts
[02:06] for a couple months and then that
[02:08] company you know went belly up or the
[02:10] the owners you know decided to abscond
[02:12] with whatever funds they had and I
[02:14] stopped getting payouts so that was my
[02:16] first kind of exposure to Bitcoin mining
[02:19] and then years later uh
[02:22] 2021 kind of reinvigorated my my study
[02:25] of Bitcoin uh at that time I found the
[02:27] price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth in the
[02:29] sovereign individual and between those
[02:32] two books you know just had my interest
[02:35] in Bitcoin very much
[02:37] reinvigorated and uh my major in college
[02:40] was was very complimentary to building
[02:42] and operating data centers so I already
[02:44] had some exposure to what it took to run
[02:47] something like a Bitcoin mining farm and
[02:50] I got into Bitcoin mining much more
[02:52] seriously at that point I put a
[02:54] significant portion of my net worth into
[02:57] some machines that I tried to host in
[02:59] the Southeastern United States and I had
[03:01] an awful experience like one of the
[03:04] worst years of my life because I just
[03:05] picked the wrong host the wrong
[03:08] equipment um and put you know far too
[03:10] much that that was not comfortable at
[03:12] all to to have a loss that year and so I
[03:17] was getting into it thinking this is a
[03:19] great source of passive income this is a
[03:21] great way for me to you know get cash
[03:24] flow at the time my my wealth building
[03:26] vehicle was real estate so I was a
[03:28] full-time real estate investor
[03:31] and just had this really awful
[03:32] experience that I thought nobody in the
[03:34] world should have to go through this if
[03:36] they're trying to get into Bitcoin
[03:37] mining and I realized that my story was
[03:39] not unique that plenty of people have
[03:41] had awful experiences putting some funds
[03:44] into Bitcoin mining and this is why so
[03:46] many people say you know just buy
[03:47] Bitcoin don't get into mining there's no
[03:49] there's no real reason to get into it's
[03:51] not necessarily more profitable and I
[03:54] didn't want to believe that I didn't
[03:56] want that to be my story I didn't want
[03:57] that to be the story for people
[04:00] and so I took that experience decided to
[04:03] take what I had left and build a
[04:04] collocation facility here in Oregon took
[04:07] about 12 months to get it off the ground
[04:09] um it was not an easy Journey we had
[04:12] roadblocks along the way but I'm happy
[04:14] to say that you know we got that
[04:16] facility up and running we're currently
[04:18] hosting about 500 units of other
[04:20] people's machines and uh you know we're
[04:23] able to deliver a much more positive and
[04:26] pleasant experience for the people that
[04:27] that host with us than the experience
[04:30] that got me into mining so in a sense it
[04:32] was a a story of I never wanted anybody
[04:35] to have my experience again and I knew
[04:38] that we could offer something better
[04:39] than what was currently on the market in
[04:41] mining do you think uh uh Bitcoin mining
[04:44] is something for the average PL to to
[04:47] get into or is it only if you have
[04:49] advantage in building those facilities
[04:52] or advantaging uh in in the cost of of
[04:55] energy so my opinion would be it's it's
[04:58] useful for anybody to learn about it's
[05:00] useful for anybody to get into even if
[05:03] it's just at a small size even people
[05:05] that host their machines with us you
[05:07] know my my advice is always if you don't
[05:09] have any Bitcoin already stacked you
[05:11] should start there you should get a a
[05:14] reasonably sized portfolio of just the
[05:16] coin because that's really the asset
[05:18] right that's the world changing
[05:20] mindbending you know philosophy
[05:23] questioning asset that you should be
[05:25] studying and Mining is just a way to get
[05:27] a better understanding of it so any time
[05:29] people get into mining I always caveat
[05:31] it with you know at minimum this is
[05:34] really just a learning tool so that you
[05:37] can have a better understanding of the
[05:38] asset you own and then when it comes to
[05:40] being profitable or being more
[05:41] profitable than owning the coin that's
[05:43] when I would say you know context
[05:45] matters what your energy sources matters
[05:48] what kind of machines you're running
[05:49] matters then you're introducing a lot
[05:51] more variables to people that they
[05:52] should consider in their own individual
[05:54] circumstance which is something that we
[05:56] help people do but I I always start with
[05:59] own Bitcoin understand Bitcoin then get
[06:02] into mining so that you can study even
[06:03] deeper for learning about Bitcoin mining
[06:07] um how far would you say we have to go
[06:10] like is a solo Miner those small nerd
[06:13] miners enough to learn about mining or
[06:16] uh should we actually like buy used S9
[06:20] and and plug it in home with a solar
[06:22] panel or something like that I think
[06:24] it's it's like anything in life right
[06:26] you get what you put in so if if all
[06:29] that you can do is buy a bid a and you
[06:32] know mine with 500 gigahash out of your
[06:34] USB outlet you're still getting benefit
[06:37] from that right and not everybody wants
[06:39] to spend five or6 thousand doar on the
[06:42] newest unit from bitmain or what Miner
[06:44] or
[06:45] oradine and so I think anything that you
[06:48] can do to further your learning of
[06:51] what's actually going on at the protocol
[06:52] level you know what's actually happening
[06:54] when you mine a block that anything is
[06:56] going to be beneficial and I'm pretty
[07:00] convinced that after you get your first
[07:02] gigahash online that you're GNA want to
[07:04] upscale that you're going to want to
[07:06] figure out how you can reuse your waste
[07:08] heat you're going to want to figure out
[07:10] oh if I have a spa might be really
[07:12] interesting to put in a a dual Loop
[07:15] immersion cooler so that I can you know
[07:17] heat my spa in the winter for free I
[07:19] think it's just a it's a rabbit hole
[07:21] that you fall down as quickly and as
[07:23] deeply as you are willing to really
[07:26] interesting um maybe let's get to this
[07:28] topic now with lowering the cost of
[07:31] energy you said uh Bitcoin will lower
[07:34] the cost of energy for for us all it
[07:37] makes it more efficient how do you mean
[07:39] that like why is that so in our world
[07:43] today we have many different demands for
[07:46] energy so you see the EV Revolution you
[07:50] see the electrification of things like
[07:52] home heating and cooling um data centers
[07:55] coming online AI is a very hot topic
[07:58] right now of of you know a major power
[08:01] user and a major demand for new power
[08:03] resources and that's all going to
[08:06] continue to happen we're going to demand
[08:08] more and more energy as time goes on and
[08:11] the future versions of us will use far
[08:13] more energy and it be a far cleaner use
[08:17] of energy than we do today and that's a
[08:19] good thing but in the context of growing
[08:22] our need
[08:23] for uh energy to be supplied that means
[08:26] that we have to grow the availability of
[08:29] energy that we can create now in the
[08:31] Pacific Northwest specifically and many
[08:33] other regions there are also
[08:35] decarbonizing initiatives so you're
[08:37] facing all of these calls to you know
[08:40] remove thermal generation remove gas
[08:43] fired peer plants uh and really
[08:46] encouraging the use of things like wind
[08:48] and solar and these other kind of
[08:50] intermittent Renewables that even though
[08:53] they are very positive they create a lot
[08:55] of energy they don't necessarily create
[08:57] reliable energy so in the absence of
[09:00] something like batteries or an
[09:02] interruptible load you have to have you
[09:05] have to have something to counterbalance
[09:07] having an intermittent generation source
[09:10] and so the reason that I say Bitcoin is
[09:12] going to lower the cost of energy for
[09:14] all is because if you're going to
[09:17] encourage intermittent load or excuse me
[09:20] intermittent energy generation that
[09:22] means you also need intermittent load so
[09:24] you need an intermittent demand source
[09:26] and Bitcoin mining is one of the few
[09:29] things that we can stand up on a grid
[09:31] that Demands a huge amount of energy but
[09:34] that you can also turn off when you need
[09:36] to so if you've uh seen in Texas there's
[09:39] frequent curtailments during the summer
[09:41] the network hash rate loves to come uh
[09:44] come down a bit during these hot summer
[09:46] months and part of that is economic
[09:49] curtailment uh that has to do with uh a
[09:53] lack of availability of energy or you
[09:55] know an increase in the price of energy
[09:57] at those times so Bitcoin miners as the
[09:59] most price sensitive users they turn off
[10:02] and essentially deliver that energy back
[10:04] to the grid so if you're thinking about
[10:07] how to design a grid system you've got
[10:09] all your generation resources and then
[10:11] you also have demand resources and if
[10:15] you have generation that does not quite
[10:18] come up to what you need for either a
[10:20] you know Midsummer Peak or mid-winter
[10:22] Peak here in the Pacific Northwest that
[10:25] means that you've got to have something
[10:27] that's that's going to give that energy
[10:28] back and many people talk about
[10:31] batteries batteries are a great solution
[10:34] for for grid management and giving
[10:35] energy back to the Grid in times of peak
[10:37] demands but at the current time they're
[10:40] either very expensive or many of them
[10:42] are highly inefficient so it pays to be
[10:45] able to have resources in your service
[10:48] territory that can turn off and even
[10:51] though you're not delivering any new
[10:53] energy to the grid because you're able
[10:55] to turn off your demand for that energy
[10:58] it has the same net benefit
[11:00] so rather than us going out and building
[11:03] you know crazy amounts of of expensive
[11:05] peer plants that may get used for a few
[11:07] hundred hours a year instead you just
[11:09] have a user who's able to cut off their
[11:11] use at specific times that avoid uh
[11:15] major major price spikes and to
[11:18] illustrate this with numbers in the
[11:20] Pacific Northwest uh your average your
[11:24] average cost of procuring energy is
[11:25] going to be somewhere between $60 and
[11:27] $90 per megawatt hour
[11:29] if you want to turn on a thermal
[11:32] generation peer plant for just a few
[11:34] hundred hours a year that can go up to
[11:37] 14 or $5,000 per megawatt hour so if you
[11:42] going to pay a Bitcoin miner for example
[11:44] to perform demand response rather than
[11:47] turn on a peer plant that might cost you
[11:49] $250 to $500 per megawatt hour in
[11:52] equivalent Energy savings net net the
[11:54] cost of or the cost benefit of having a
[11:57] demand response resource in your grid
[12:00] versus turning on a peer plant might
[12:02] save you 96 97% of the energy cost that
[12:06] you would incur for those couple hundred
[12:08] hours of emergency circumstances it's
[12:10] really interesting when when we look at
[12:11] Bitcoin mining there's so many
[12:13] interesting angles we can go through uh
[12:15] but it's the the flexibility of Bitcoin
[12:17] mining uh as you mentioned uh that's
[12:20] such an amazing uh advantage and I feel
[12:23] like a lot of States get it like taxes
[12:28] uh but a lot of states
[12:29] still don't get it like they are still
[12:31] thinking oh no Bitcoin mining is bad
[12:33] it's like for the environment and all
[12:35] those those those FS that they have in
[12:36] their head um
[12:40] is the the one thing uh that I maybe to
[12:44] get a better grid of that uh I had I
[12:47] think a month ago or one and a half
[12:48] months ago a podcast with someone that
[12:52] writes fiction novels that are far in
[12:55] the future also related to bitcoin
[12:59] and there are parts of it that's just
[13:02] fiction and parts of it he actually
[13:04] thinks will come true uh and it's just
[13:07] really this was a podcast that actually
[13:09] like expands your thinking of where
[13:11] Bitcoin could go uh so far that he said
[13:15] like 99% of Earth's of of the energy of
[13:19] the
[13:20] universe uh that uh uh people will live
[13:24] on like when we live Al in other planets
[13:27] uh will be used
[13:29] um to mine Bitcoin uh because we will
[13:33] have so much energy that we will live in
[13:35] in such an abundance that we will just
[13:38] turn on this as the best form of
[13:41] monetization of that energy and with
[13:43] that 1% that we have left we have more
[13:46] than enough energy to uh do everything
[13:49] that humans uh can do is is that
[13:52] something that you could foresee very
[13:55] far in the future he also talked about
[13:58] uh putting Sol panelist on mercery and
[14:01] stuff like that I could definitely see
[14:02] that playing out you know you can you
[14:05] can phrase it as Bitcoin will lower the
[14:07] cost of energy for all you could also
[14:09] say that Bitcoin will usher in an era of
[14:12] energy abundance so that
[14:15] that example that you were just talking
[14:17] about really fits that you know we're
[14:19] living in a world where there's so much
[14:22] energy we've we've been so Innovative
[14:24] and so smart with our resources that
[14:26] there's there's almost nothing else that
[14:28] we need need to use it for because we've
[14:30] created so much of it and that's that's
[14:33] kind of the the the other side of that
[14:35] same coin and it's not it's not such a
[14:39] it's not such a crazy thing I
[14:41] mean even in in Texas you mentioned I
[14:44] think they are very forward thinking and
[14:46] in many ways being in the Pacific
[14:48] Northwest we're just trying to model
[14:50] some of the success and some of the
[14:52] experimentation that they've already
[14:53] done successfully um they had a story
[14:56] where several years ago they were going
[14:59] to put on uh an additional $1 billion of
[15:02] peer plants so they foresaw a need for
[15:06] additional emergency generation at
[15:07] certain points of the year and Berkshire
[15:10] hathway was going to build these peer
[15:12] plants so that they had additional
[15:14] energy on the grid for these peak times
[15:17] and because of the presence of Bitcoin
[15:19] mining there was about two gws of of
[15:22] interruptable load uh that's
[15:24] characterized as Bitcoin mining on the
[15:26] grid because they were already particip
[15:29] ating in demand response programs uh
[15:31] Texas did not need to build those
[15:33] additional peer plants so they saved
[15:35] taxpayers you know collectively about 10
[15:38] billion dollar in avoided costs and you
[15:42] know that's a form of abundance that's a
[15:44] form of energy abundance is not needing
[15:46] to develop anything additional um and
[15:49] being able to just stick with your
[15:50] current base load generation is is
[15:53] avoiding building that additional so I
[15:55] see you know that's that's one real life
[15:57] story where where
[15:59] uh Bitcoin mining was able to encourage
[16:01] energy abundance and save people money
[16:03] on on energy costs but you project that
[16:07] further out into the future and it's
[16:09] likely to impact every grid system that
[16:11] we have um I love the the company
[16:14] gridless in in Kenya you know they're
[16:17] extremely Innovative with with how they
[16:19] bring energy abundance to these
[16:20] communities that again this it's already
[16:23] exists all of all of the energy that we
[16:26] need is already here in the world and
[16:27] most of it's just wasted or not properly
[16:29] used um I think I think Bitcoin mining
[16:33] especially in those contexts just
[16:35] unlocks this ability to use resources
[16:38] that have been um you know either
[16:40] economically stranded or there was no
[16:43] highest and best use for those energy
[16:45] resources and now because we can
[16:47] introduce these interruptible loads this
[16:50] this kind of Base load consumer that
[16:52] always wants energy but is also always
[16:54] willing to give it back uh really
[16:56] encourages this this beautiful
[16:58] flourishing of humanity and and gives us
[17:01] energy abundance in this way that at
[17:04] least I never thought would be the way
[17:05] that it would come about but is very
[17:07] interesting to watch unfold and very
[17:08] interesting to be a part of why do we
[17:11] keep hearing in especially in the
[17:13] mainstream media um that energy is so
[17:16] scarce that uh we everything will
[17:20] Skyrocket impr prise and I mean it will
[17:22] skyro in price if you measure it in in a
[17:25] highly inflatable currency but uh why is
[17:28] that
[17:29] scarcity in energy this this kind of
[17:32] mindset in in in uh people who are not
[17:36] in in energy and and why do they don't
[17:39] see that that we actually could go to
[17:41] like an energy abundant
[17:43] future I think you hit it part of it is
[17:45] that we we denominate it in a highly
[17:48] inflationary currency so even if the
[17:51] true cost of energy stays level you're
[17:53] going to see your bill go up every year
[17:55] and it's it's hard to convince people of
[17:58] something that's different than what
[17:59] they see that's different than what they
[18:01] see on their power bill every month but
[18:03] the other part of that is we have plenty
[18:05] of energy in the world and it's usually
[18:07] the delivery of energy that that makes
[18:10] it very expensive or very hard to get so
[18:12] in in at least the US for example we
[18:16] have a a transmission capacity issue
[18:18] where there's more than enough energy to
[18:21] be created but the actual Network for
[18:24] Distributing that energy is very old is
[18:26] very uh you know it was built for
[18:30] capacity that now we've we've very
[18:32] quickly grown into and are about to grow
[18:34] out of and so even if there's the
[18:38] ability to create new generation and
[18:40] create new cheap generation uh let's say
[18:43] you know a a really cheap and and
[18:46] effective nuclear plant goes up in Texas
[18:49] that doesn't help me at all in the
[18:50] Pacific Northwest because that energy
[18:52] has to travel more than a thousand miles
[18:54] to get up here and not only is that
[18:57] unavailable in ter terms of transmission
[18:59] capacity but most of that energy gets
[19:01] lost as well so you can a rule of thumb
[19:04] is for about every 500 miles of
[19:06] transmission you lose 2% of the energy
[19:09] so by the time energy travels from one
[19:11] coast of the us to another you've lost
[19:14] you know close to 10% of what you
[19:15] started with which makes it less
[19:18] economical one of the things that's come
[19:20] out recently that that people are
[19:22] working on is is superconductors that
[19:24] you know minimize this energy loss but
[19:26] even even implementing that seems kind
[19:28] of like a a far-off vision it may be
[19:31] something that that becomes more popular
[19:33] in the next decade or two decades but
[19:35] it's not a real impr present solution
[19:38] and that's that's part of why I think
[19:40] Bitcoin mining is is so important at
[19:42] this state in time is that we know that
[19:45] there are these resources that are going
[19:48] to make energy much more abundant we
[19:50] talked about batteries for a minute
[19:52] batteries are going to be extremely
[19:53] important but for now they're very cost
[19:56] intensive they're very inefficient um
[19:59] they're still in their their proving
[20:01] stage and we have grids that are having
[20:04] issues now and they're going to have
[20:06] issues you know in the very near
[20:08] foreseeable future with capacity and
[20:10] transmission and Peak availability and
[20:13] it's my opinion that all of these other
[20:16] Innovations are going to be very
[20:17] important but that they're not quite
[20:19] ready that they're still very early
[20:21] stages and something like Bitcoin mining
[20:23] and interruptable load has already been
[20:25] working on the grid for years uh I mean
[20:27] demand response program in Texas have
[20:29] been around um you know far longer than
[20:32] Bitcoin mining even has demand response
[20:34] is not a new idea this is this is not
[20:36] something that Bitcoin miners invented
[20:38] we just happen to be really good at
[20:39] participating in it so it's it's my
[20:42] opinion that we have a clear and present
[20:44] danger with our grids becoming
[20:46] unreliable and extremely expensive and
[20:49] that Bitcoin mining is the most
[20:51] near-term most readily available
[20:53] resource that we can stop the price
[20:56] increases and stop the unreliability of
[20:58] our grids with technology that we have
[21:00] available and scalable today is it
[21:03] recommended for people who have uh a
[21:07] house who have a roof that's mostly in
[21:09] the Sun or what's stopping them to put
[21:12] like a bunch of solar panels on there
[21:15] plug a a Bitcoin miner on there use the
[21:18] energy that they use in the household if
[21:20] they have access energy just put it in
[21:22] the in the Bitcoin miner and just
[21:24] monetize all the excess energy uh turn
[21:26] it off the Bitcoin miners if if they
[21:28] have less energy like uh that that would
[21:31] be even better than a battery I feel
[21:33] like I think that's part of it uh you
[21:36] know or even having both in tandem you
[21:39] know the the grid scale batteries I
[21:42] think are very expensive but uh if you
[21:45] have have ever heard of or you know
[21:46] people with Tesla power walls those are
[21:49] those are playing demand response games
[21:51] right now in people's homes and you can
[21:53] choose to sell your power back to the
[21:55] Grid or you could sell your own stored
[21:57] power to your own Bitcoin miner
[21:59] um I think it's only going to become
[22:02] more common for us to have these these
[22:05] more like micro grids where where people
[22:08] at their source of consumption have some
[22:10] kind of generating resource that's kind
[22:12] of another uh pressure release valve for
[22:15] making sure that our grids remain stable
[22:17] is having the ability for homes and
[22:20] businesses to generate some of their own
[22:22] energy and if they are generating their
[22:24] own energy you know in in many cases
[22:28] it's not as attractive to sell that
[22:30] energy back to the grid you get a far
[22:33] lower a far lower proportion of what you
[22:36] would pay for that energy when you give
[22:38] that energy back you know some something
[22:40] on the order of 20 to
[22:41] 50% uh is is what you can expect to sell
[22:44] your energy back for versus what you pay
[22:46] for it and so if let's say just for
[22:49] example residential rates in the Pacific
[22:51] Northwest are around 15 cents a kilowatt
[22:53] hour and I can sell that energy back for
[22:56] five or six cents a kilowatt hour if I
[22:58] have a Bitcoin minor I would much rather
[23:01] if it's one of the newer generation
[23:02] units I would much rather get my you
[23:05] know 12 to 20 cents a kilowatt hour for
[23:07] just running my Bitcoin minor versus
[23:09] selling my energy back to the grid so
[23:11] definitely at the individual level I
[23:14] think that it's it's very interesting to
[23:15] start integrating your own generation
[23:18] your own storage as well as a way to use
[23:20] energy economically uh through Bitcoin
[23:23] mining at your home that's also a way
[23:25] that you can keep it non kyc self
[23:28] Sovereign you know all the things that
[23:29] bitcoiners love is if you're doing it on
[23:31] your own network in your own home and
[23:34] it's not tied to a hosting facility like
[23:36] ours or many of the others in the world
[23:38] there's there's almost nothing that
[23:39] anybody can do to stop you from using
[23:41] that and from from generating your own
[23:43] sound
[23:44] money yeah and it's the the best non kyc
[23:48] because it comes literally from nobody
[23:51] like even even if you exchange with
[23:54] someone on the on the street and you
[23:57] make like this someone knows that the
[24:00] Bitcoin are now with you uh it's like
[24:03] even if you have really strictly non kyc
[24:07] Bitcoin um they're not completely non
[24:11] kyc uh they have to care someone that
[24:13] someone maybe knows you it's still
[24:16] better to have than a full kyc exchange
[24:18] or something like that completely
[24:20] Bitcoin mining uh and then get those
[24:23] Bitcoin as non KC in your uh in your
[24:27] wallet and have it as a completely
[24:29] separate stack to the other stack and
[24:32] never connecting them uh that would be
[24:35] uh I think a great way to to stack some
[24:38] non KC uh Bitcoin with a depending on
[24:42] how you do it probably with a premium uh
[24:44] depending on on how how you have access
[24:47] to it uh because if if Bitcoin mining
[24:50] could be more costly than just stacking
[24:52] Bitcoin right it can be for sure and
[24:55] that's that's part of why I always tell
[24:57] people you know start start with your
[24:59] stack start with your Bitcoin stack
[25:01] before you put a meaningful portion of
[25:03] your net worth into mining um but that
[25:06] said you know there's there's all kinds
[25:08] of really cool revolutions going on in
[25:10] our world Bitcoin being one of them but
[25:13] I I view the proliferation of Bitcoin
[25:16] mining as the availability of your own
[25:20] personal alchemical process so you think
[25:24] of of alchemy as being transforming base
[25:26] Metals into gold um or the internal
[25:30] alchemical process of of transforming
[25:32] base emotions into this kind of higher
[25:34] spiritual vibration I think Bitcoin
[25:37] mining is its own version of alchemy
[25:39] where you're you're able to take these
[25:40] raw
[25:41] resources energy comes in many forms and
[25:44] and people have all sorts of different
[25:46] ways of gaining energy but you take this
[25:49] kind of lower level disordered or not
[25:53] quite perfectly ordered energy source
[25:56] and through this repeatable process of
[25:58] generating entropy you actually create
[26:02] you know the most impressive money in
[26:04] the world far more impressive than
[26:06] turning lead into gold you turn energy
[26:09] raw energy into Bitcoin the soundest
[26:11] money in the world I think it's a
[26:13] profound Evolution for human freedom and
[26:15] prosperity that everybody can be in
[26:17] charge of this open alchemical process
[26:20] that they're able to participate in it
[26:22] will if you watch or listen to my
[26:24] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[26:27] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[26:29] most important step is to keep the
[26:32] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[26:35] wallet my personal recommendation for
[26:36] hard wallet is the bitbox it's super
[26:39] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[26:42] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[26:44] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[26:47] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[26:50] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[26:54] robobin to get your bitbox and if you
[26:57] really want to B bulletproof your self
[26:59] custody setup your security setup and
[27:01] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[27:05] have to talk to the Bitcoin way if you
[27:07] go to the Bitcoin way.com
[27:10] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[27:14] free call where you can dive deep with
[27:17] them if your self- custody setup is
[27:20] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[27:23] maybe might be improvable or your
[27:25] digital footprint in general is secure
[27:28] they are the experts in cyber security
[27:31] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[27:34] secure sovereign individual in general
[27:38] that's true that's uh really cool and
[27:40] also what I thought about right now is
[27:42] when we have uh as we talked about a
[27:45] little bit before with the solar panels
[27:47] on the roof and having your own uh um
[27:50] Power Plant basically at home when you
[27:52] have the power wall from from Tesla as
[27:54] we talked about will will that in the
[27:57] future when we have and more of this
[27:58] developments than also like decentralize
[28:01] the Bitcoin mining
[28:03] further I would say so I would say very
[28:07] large corporate Farms like the public
[28:11] companies that Mega facility model
[28:14] unless you have a very specialized
[28:16] strategy is likely to get outcompeted by
[28:20] uh Guerilla miners people that have
[28:22] their own energy generation they don't
[28:24] have huge fixed Administration costs and
[28:27] corporate costs
[28:28] the people who have their own resource
[28:32] are able to mine at any cost do not turn
[28:35] off their hash rate for any reason and
[28:38] uh are not subject to the same kinds of
[28:40] constraints as large grid operated
[28:42] miners I think those are our future and
[28:44] I think that that only contributes to
[28:46] the health of the network and you
[28:48] already see this in in you know places
[28:51] like Africa where most of the miners who
[28:53] are mining in Africa are not mining on
[28:56] the grid you know they're they're mining
[28:57] with their own generation sources often
[29:01] many miles or hundreds of miles from the
[29:03] nearest population Center I think that
[29:05] that trend of collocating Bitcoin mining
[29:09] with these distributed energy resources
[29:11] that are owned by individuals and
[29:13] families is only going to lead to more
[29:16] decentralization more decentralization
[29:18] more security um and a network that is
[29:21] that is healthier to be honest with you
[29:23] we've seen in the last year some some
[29:26] kind of pool centralization fear from
[29:28] people that that many of the blocks are
[29:30] being mined by some version of antpool
[29:34] um I think that that as the resources
[29:37] being dedicated to Bitcoin mining spread
[29:39] out more effectively and become more
[29:41] distributed those kinds of fears are are
[29:44] able to fade into the background we're
[29:45] able to to Really uh believe that we've
[29:49] got a much more decentralized Network
[29:51] that that is much more secure from any
[29:53] kind of centralized attack or uh from
[29:56] you know large public companies that are
[29:57] on grid being co-opted by a government
[29:59] with malicious intent I don't think it's
[30:02] a strong danger right now but I would
[30:05] like it to be not even a thought right
[30:08] and I think most people who are who are
[30:09] bitcoiners would agree we even though
[30:12] we're not necessarily concerned for for
[30:14] today's problems we want tomorrow to be
[30:17] a very clear and open network that that
[30:21] doesn't rely on the cooperation of of
[30:24] some of these larger
[30:26] entities a lot of people um make that
[30:30] argument though the the pool
[30:32] centralization like mining I feel like
[30:35] is quite decentralized now like America
[30:38] has what like 30% or something like that
[30:41] of the mining power and they are the
[30:43] biggest ones uh in 2021 it was a little
[30:46] bit of a different story where a lot of
[30:48] the mining power was still in
[30:50] China good for us they they wanted to
[30:53] get rid of it they did not get rid of it
[30:55] but they decentralized the Bitcoin
[30:56] mining git um with that action uh thank
[30:59] you China I would say uh um but but
[31:04] would the mining pools if let's say
[31:07] there are only really two uh big mining
[31:10] pools uh I mean there are more now but
[31:13] if if there would be like if the mining
[31:15] pool centralization would go in a bad
[31:17] direction would that be something you
[31:19] would worry about so uh once upon a time
[31:22] I would have worried about it uh but
[31:24] with protocols like ocean I don't know
[31:27] if you've you've had any of them on to
[31:28] talk with you but um what what they've
[31:31] been working on really brings the power
[31:33] of of creating block templates back to
[31:36] the miners themselves and so even if
[31:40] let's say antpool or ant pool's
[31:42] derivatives control 60 to 70% of the
[31:45] hash rate even if that is true and even
[31:48] if most blocks are mined with their you
[31:51] know criteria and their templates any
[31:54] individual minor so long as they are are
[31:57] still contributing to the network has
[31:58] the ability to mine a block with their
[32:00] own template so we could go through a
[32:04] period where uh it's more challenging
[32:07] there's maybe more censorship or more uh
[32:10] putting in of of these kinds of of data
[32:12] and transactions that that some
[32:15] fundamental bitcoiners really don't like
[32:17] but the fact that any blocks because you
[32:20] know it's a random process right when
[32:22] when you're when you're mining you
[32:24] looking for this this nons this single
[32:27] random number that's available to any of
[32:30] the the miners on the network and it
[32:31] just happens that these large pools are
[32:33] going to find it more often but even if
[32:35] it's one out of 10 times or one out of
[32:37] 30 times you're still going to get
[32:39] transactions through so I could
[32:42] see I could see a regime of suppression
[32:45] but I don't think you could get to
[32:47] allout stopping of the free movement of
[32:51] data and trade over the network I think
[32:53] that it would be at worst you know
[32:56] slowing down the ability for people to
[32:58] get their transactions through uh but
[33:00] not able to to all out stop it or all
[33:02] out
[33:03] censor for me uh a big part of my
[33:07] confidence in Bitcoin actually comes
[33:10] from 2017 From the Block size Wars uh
[33:13] when you really studied that you're like
[33:15] oh the the decentralization of the notes
[33:18] decentralizations of the actual use of
[33:21] Bitcoin um is really important uh to
[33:24] that whole story and even if uh
[33:27] seemingly the whole industry is for
[33:28] larger blocks and and all a lot of
[33:31] Bitcoin Mars are even for that um even
[33:34] then resilience of the network is really
[33:37] strong and it just grows on like we had
[33:39] now a point where I put the risk on
[33:42] bitcoin so extremely low that the risk
[33:46] reward is just like such a beautiful
[33:48] thing right now I totally agree with you
[33:51] I when I first got into you know was
[33:54] first studying it around 2015 between
[33:56] 2015 and 2017 let's say I still thought
[33:59] that there were plenty of ways for it to
[34:01] be damaged or co-opted or you know in
[34:05] some way hampered from achieving its
[34:07] ultimate
[34:08] purpose I at this point in in time I
[34:11] find it really hard to believe that
[34:13] there's almost anything and I you know I
[34:15] knock on wood as I say this because I I
[34:17] don't want there to be anything but it
[34:20] it's really hard to believe for me that
[34:21] there would be anything that could
[34:23] seriously damage this network or get in
[34:25] the way of it achieving its ultimate
[34:26] purpose in fact I'm I'm curious to ask
[34:29] you is there anything that you worry
[34:31] about at this point other than just
[34:33] human action there's always like we know
[34:36] all the attack factors of Bitcoin like
[34:38] we we we talked about so many and I
[34:41] probably covered all of them already in
[34:43] the podcast I'm at episode 198 so I'm
[34:47] I'm soon with 200 episodes out uh so we
[34:51] covered a lot um the only thing that's
[34:54] possible and I choose not to live my
[34:58] life uh worrying about those but there's
[35:01] always a black swor event like something
[35:03] that we cannot foresee and a Black Swan
[35:06] event by definition is something that we
[35:09] cannot
[35:10] foresee uh so yes of course if you like
[35:14] oh I want to diversify my portfolio also
[35:17] in Gold also in real estate also in
[35:19] stocks because there could be a black SW
[35:21] event first of all like it's really hard
[35:24] to think of one uh and and second of all
[35:28] why would you um put your whole life
[35:32] savings uh in in in other assets that
[35:35] are not as great as the best form of
[35:39] money ever uh just because there is like
[35:42] a
[35:43] 0.01% chance that there might be
[35:46] something bad happening and I think if
[35:49] such a black SW event actually happens
[35:53] um the possibility is that we can
[35:55] actually rely on anything in finances
[35:57] and computers and internet are probably
[35:59] pretty low because this had to be H like
[36:03] as long as we have the internet and as
[36:05] long as we have a free flow of of
[36:09] communication in some regard it's really
[36:12] hard for me to imagine any uh thing that
[36:16] could break Bitcoin there are attack
[36:19] vectors but all of those attack vectors
[36:21] when you go through them you're like oh
[36:23] this is not this is almost impossible
[36:27] and very unrealistic yeah of course like
[36:30] if you if you control all of the sudden
[36:33] is there is like uh when all of a sudden
[36:37] alien creatures come to Earth and they
[36:40] are so more so sophisticated uh way more
[36:44] sophisticated than than we are uh they
[36:47] can force their money onto US yeah that
[36:50] that would destroy Bitcoin but that
[36:53] would destroy all forms of money that we
[36:56] have uh so of course I can think of
[36:58] things uh that destroy Bitcoin but How
[37:01] likely are those actually and do you
[37:04] really want to uh go on because like it
[37:08] it's like you clean the whole house and
[37:11] and then there's like one small crumb
[37:14] laying on the table and then you're like
[37:15] oh the the whole house is dirty no
[37:18] it's like the house is clean it's it's
[37:20] it's a nice house that's just a crumb
[37:23] like leave it there like you will not
[37:25] see it if you don't watch it so
[37:28] uh there there's no perfect there is no
[37:30] 100% security there's no 100% of
[37:33] anything uh but Bitcoin is the closest
[37:35] thing to that I feel like right I see a
[37:38] lot like I don't I don't think there's
[37:40] anything on the Chain itself that that
[37:44] could lead to catastrophic failure let's
[37:46] call it um any any attack factors that I
[37:50] see at this point that have any shot
[37:52] really are they're they're offchain they
[37:55] have more to do with price suppression
[37:56] you know things like the ETFs and other
[37:58] kind of synthetic Bitcoin derivatives
[38:01] that may or may not be real coin you
[38:04] know they they can for a time at least
[38:07] co-opt the N number go up kind of
[38:11] benefit of Bitcoin but I don't see I
[38:13] don't see anything really long-term
[38:16] breaking the network let's say and you
[38:19] you even mentioned stocks gold real
[38:22] estate like part of my personal
[38:24] transition from those assets and having
[38:27] in my portfolio was realizing that all
[38:30] of the black swans that could impact
[38:32] those markets were far more likely they
[38:35] were built in structurally um you know
[38:38] it was a a very interesting day when it
[38:41] was first told to me that hey did you
[38:43] realize that most of the value of the
[38:45] market cap of the world's real estate is
[38:48] the debt that backs that real estate you
[38:50] know realizing that it it takes one
[38:54] systemic event for 80% of of the value
[38:58] of that asset to just evaporate
[39:00] overnight because it's backed by this
[39:02] imaginary uh you know imaginary
[39:05] instrument that doesn't actually have
[39:06] any kind of value other than what you
[39:08] can what you can say you owe to someone
[39:10] else um and same with many of these
[39:13] others like like gold even the the issue
[39:15] with the ETFs for Bitcoin like that's
[39:18] been a known issue for gold for years I
[39:20] I grew up in a family that had pretty
[39:23] strong opinions on gold um own gold and
[39:27] it took me you know many years of of
[39:29] owning gold to realize that the price
[39:32] could very easily be manipulated by all
[39:34] kinds of different Market mechanisms and
[39:37] in some sense you know getting to to see
[39:40] the flaws the cracks in the thesis with
[39:43] all these different assets was even more
[39:46] of a selling point to to get into this
[39:48] thing that one you know only a handful
[39:51] of us in the world have really studied
[39:53] for more than a few hundred hours um and
[39:55] two doesn't seem to have any of the
[39:57] vulnerabilities that these other asset
[39:59] classes do in the sense that it really
[40:01] is its own self-contained universe is
[40:05] the Cockroach of all investment assets
[40:08] and short of you know allout nuclear war
[40:11] uh there's there's almost nothing that
[40:14] can take it down and even in your case
[40:16] you know the internet going out that's
[40:18] not even a Threat Vector as long as
[40:20] you've got short band radio and you can
[40:22] communicate over radio signals like it's
[40:25] it's really um it's really an example of
[40:28] of antifragility and I would say almost
[40:31] invincibility it's it's one of our first
[40:34] kind of invincible assets to have erased
[40:36] the world and for that reason it's it's
[40:38] very interesting to study because almost
[40:40] nothing else maybe nothing else has that
[40:43] kind of quality baked into it you raised
[40:47] right in the beginning when you started
[40:49] a really interesting point a lot of
[40:52] people um confuse volatility and maybe
[40:57] even price manipulation with actual
[40:59] risks to bitcoin
[41:02] because yes uh blackr could uh issue
[41:06] paper Bitcoin uh more than they actually
[41:09] have FDX did that they had like two
[41:13] Bitcoin on their balance sheet and a lot
[41:15] more in their accounts uh actually so
[41:19] this is something that absolutely can
[41:22] happen that probably will happen in the
[41:25] future like if you have your Bitcoin on
[41:27] an exchange where it's just a number um
[41:31] it's very
[41:32] likely uh that there might be like I
[41:37] have an amazing example last time heard
[41:39] on the podcast if you go to a bar uh and
[41:42] and the bar you usually have to give
[41:44] your jacket off to get in because you
[41:47] cannot have to jacket inside of the bar
[41:50] uh and uh you give them your jacket you
[41:53] usually give them like one EUR two EUR
[41:55] and then you get a token you have a
[41:58] token now but this
[42:01] token means nothing he can sell this
[42:04] jacket in the mean time he can rent it
[42:06] out in the meantime he can lay on it he
[42:09] can use it as a blanket he can do
[42:11] whatever he wants with that blanket and
[42:13] you have just have a token and he says
[42:16] like oh your token number is not even in
[42:17] my list did you do your to did you issue
[42:21] your toing yourself like good luck
[42:24] proving that you actually took the the
[42:26] jacket there like you have no proof and
[42:28] that the same thing is if you have
[42:30] Bitcoin not yourself if you don't have
[42:33] your uh the keys yourself then we come
[42:36] to the point where as you as you
[42:38] mentioned yes we can have price
[42:41] manipulations with uh f f with players
[42:45] like centralized exchanges or even yeah
[42:48] coinbase like Bitcoin ETFs with
[42:50] blackrook and stuff like that um but
[42:53] those will only work in the short to
[42:56] medium term at some point those scams
[42:59] come to light uh and uh you still have
[43:03] your
[43:03] Bitcoin and and all of the sudden
[43:06] Bitcoin is worth way more because uh
[43:08] they actually have to buy some or they
[43:11] they crash down like no matter what
[43:12] happens that the truth will come to
[43:14] light and that's that's not really a
[43:16] risk that's I think just
[43:19] shortterm um price manipulation which is
[43:23] a short-term risk when your purchasing
[43:25] power is is manipulated but it's still a
[43:27] Bitcoin like you still have it like
[43:30] nothing changes in the fundamental value
[43:32] of it 100% And that you know that goes
[43:36] back into why I get into mining is if
[43:38] you if you believe in this future where
[43:40] this is something that everybody demands
[43:42] and everybody wants to get their hands
[43:44] on real Bitcoin and there's all these
[43:47] vehicles for you to get something that
[43:48] may or may not be V Bitcoin one of the
[43:52] few ways that you can guarantee your
[43:54] access to this type of money is being
[43:56] able to generate Yourself by having an
[43:58] energy resource and having an Asic and
[44:01] actually mining your own blocks it's
[44:03] it's one of the few ways to guarantee
[44:05] that you've got Sovereign access right
[44:08] this is part of part of my reading the
[44:10] sovereign individual is realizing okay
[44:12] if I'm truly going to be a sovereign
[44:14] individual I cannot rely on coinbase or
[44:17] Kraken or any of these exchanges to have
[44:20] Bitcoin for me to buy in the future and
[44:22] even if they do you know they they it
[44:25] may come with strings attached you never
[44:26] know what what they're going to to do
[44:29] they may force you to hold it in a
[44:30] custody account at some point in the
[44:32] future there may be regulation that that
[44:34] keeps you from from holding on to your
[44:36] own Bitcoin and part of the thesis for
[44:40] me getting into mining was well you know
[44:43] since 2020 the balance on exchanges has
[44:45] decreased if you look at the the trend
[44:47] line in 2020 we went from exchanges
[44:51] accumulating Bitcoin and getting up to
[44:53] about four million Bitcoin across all
[44:55] exchanges since then downward slope goes
[44:58] from four million Bitcoin on exchanges
[45:00] in in about 2020 to now I think it's
[45:03] somewhere around two maybe two and a
[45:04] half um and getting lower every day
[45:07] because the ETFs are demanding so much
[45:10] so if if we project that further out
[45:12] into the future nobody wants to sell
[45:14] their coin how else are you going to get
[45:16] it unless you can get it directly from
[45:18] the network and that was that was my
[45:20] personal Journey was making sure that
[45:24] that I and anybody who who I care about
[45:27] has their own Sovereign access to being
[45:29] able to make their own Bitcoin and not
[45:31] depend on a a third party or regulated
[45:34] exchange to be able to get it for them
[45:36] yeah that's a that's a major thing
[45:38] actually that's really really cool one
[45:40] thing that I always try to to keep in my
[45:43] podcast because it's also Bitcoin only
[45:45] focus podcast and and you also said you
[45:47] you tried it a little bit with altcoins
[45:49] what made you switch to the Bitcoin only
[45:52] like what's what if if there's one thing
[45:54] what made you realize oh it it's Bitcoin
[45:56] not not data things yeah it it plays
[46:00] into mining as well uh ethereum's switch
[46:03] to proof of stake was like the nail in
[46:06] the coffin for me um now it was it was
[46:10] many other things too I mean one thing
[46:12] is the the mindset around Bitcoin you
[46:15] know anybody who's getting into altcoins
[46:18] or or these kind of newer projects
[46:20] they're usually looking for a moonshot
[46:23] to you know get a lot of a lot of Fiat
[46:26] money very quickly you know do some kind
[46:29] of crazy multiple on whatever they put
[46:31] into it and so it's very much a mindset
[46:33] of risk-taking and
[46:35] speculation and uh just even all out
[46:39] gambling you know and at the time that
[46:43] that ethereum was switching to proof of
[46:45] stake I was going through my own kind of
[46:47] mindset shift right where there was a a
[46:50] younger version of me who who wanted
[46:52] nothing but to speculate and do a THX
[46:55] and and make a lot of money very quickly
[46:57] and go retire to an island and it it's
[47:01] very multifaceted but the whole attitude
[47:03] around showing proof of work and showing
[47:07] up and and doing the important basic
[47:09] things every day and not getting
[47:11] distracted staying focused um staying
[47:15] true to fundamentals and and not getting
[47:17] distracted by shiny object syndrome it
[47:20] was it was both a personal shift and
[47:22] also a protocol shift that kind of
[47:23] coincided at the same point this this uh
[47:26] I guess it was fall of
[47:27] 2021 um when when all this was going on
[47:31] and so that that shift to proof of stake
[47:33] was was the nail in the coffin that
[47:35] showed me okay this network does not
[47:39] reward the people that put honest work
[47:41] into it it rewards the people who
[47:43] already have a large stack and it's
[47:45] vulnerable to being co-opted by the
[47:48] largest holders whereas Bitcoin has
[47:51] shown itself to be through its entire
[47:54] history honorable truthful to its
[47:57] original uh you know original protocol
[48:00] layout truthful to the rules that it
[48:03] laid out and to the philosophy of what
[48:05] it was creating and you know it's it's
[48:09] so deep and it's so multifaceted but I
[48:11] would say that that that was the the
[48:13] main point was
[48:15] realizing what the network was rewarding
[48:18] and what kind of network would actually
[48:20] build me into a better person so it it
[48:22] gets kind of philosophical it gets to
[48:24] the who do you want to be and who do you
[48:26] want to show up at
[48:27] and you know since 2021 or so I've I've
[48:31] been very dedicated to showing up as the
[48:33] man who's willing to put in the work and
[48:35] not shy away from a hard task that's
[48:37] worthwhile rather than going for the
[48:39] easy brain sugar dopamine of hitting
[48:42] something big really quickly that's I
[48:45] think a general rule in life that people
[48:49] can adopt H go for the hard route to
[48:52] have an easier
[48:54] life in the long run that's a that's
[48:57] major major learning that I feel like
[48:59] some learn too late or never
[49:03] um you you do a lot of uh Bitcoin mining
[49:06] you do uh other things in Bitcoin can
[49:08] you give us like a little bit of an
[49:09] overview what you do in Bitcoin uh you
[49:11] you work entirely just in Bitcoin right
[49:14] like you focused like only Bitcoin right
[49:16] now correct we we don't allow any
[49:17] shitcoin miners in our facilities so we
[49:20] are 100% Bitcoin only company um our
[49:23] main service offerings are equipment
[49:25] sales and hosting so someone's trying to
[49:27] get into Bitcoin mining we're happy to
[49:29] supply you a machine and put it in one
[49:30] of our facilities and I would say that
[49:33] that is the Bare Bones like if I were
[49:37] going to do one thing well that would be
[49:39] what we do just because that was my own
[49:41] personal experience of having such an
[49:42] awful time with getting the wrong
[49:45] equipment getting the wrong partner
[49:46] putting it in the wrong place uh that
[49:48] led to so much pain and so if we can do
[49:51] that right for people that that's very
[49:54] important also with that I think that
[49:56] Bitcoin mining is is a beautiful view
[49:59] into engineering and learning more about
[50:01] how our world is engineered and how it
[50:03] can be better engineered so we provide a
[50:05] lot of uh education to current clients
[50:08] as well as you know free education
[50:09] through our podcasts and monthly
[50:11] education calls and so uh those are our
[50:15] two main arms are education and Bitcoin
[50:18] mining with collocation so collocating
[50:20] your miners with us we also are uh
[50:23] promoting initiatives and starting
[50:25] initiatives in the Pacific Northwest
[50:27] to get legislation like what Dennis
[50:29] Porter passed in a couple other states
[50:31] in the US passed in our region so that
[50:33] we can protect the rights of Bitcoin
[50:35] holders and miners in our region um as
[50:38] well as you know contribute to this this
[50:41] grid of the future that I believe exists
[50:43] hand inand with Bitcoin mining so we
[50:46] talked about Texas for a little while
[50:48] how urot is kind of leading the way and
[50:50] being very forward thinking and
[50:51] experimental with how they integrate
[50:53] flexible loads like Bitcoin mining our
[50:56] region uh has not had such a need for
[50:58] this in the past and it's really just
[51:00] now coming to the surface that that we
[51:02] need to have these programs so one of
[51:04] our main initiatives is integrating with
[51:07] utilities and making sure that demand
[51:09] response programs are proliferated
[51:11] throughout the Pacific Northwest and the
[51:13] Bitcoin miners are rewarded for those
[51:15] amazing really really cool um great what
[51:18] you're doing um we come now close to the
[51:20] end routine of the podcast I have one
[51:23] question always before the end routine
[51:25] uh and the question question is what can
[51:27] we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[51:30] besides Bitcoin mining besides the
[51:31] things uh that we already talked about
[51:33] in the
[51:35] podcast you know uh I have a really I
[51:39] have a really profound desire to create
[51:43] more time for myself and more time for
[51:45] other people um if you've ever read G's
[51:49] post about Bitcoin is time uh Jack MERS
[51:52] also did a a post on this or or talk on
[51:55] this at Bitcoin Atlanta
[51:57] um really passionate about helping
[51:59] people build a life that is rich in time
[52:01] in fact I have a book this is a great
[52:05] purchase if you want to spend $20 it's
[52:06] called buyback your time it's by Dan
[52:09] Martell it's uh geared toward business
[52:12] owners and entrepreneurs but I think it
[52:13] applies to anybody you know we we get
[52:17] into Bitcoin partially because we're
[52:18] looking to create wealth but also
[52:20] because of what wealth creates which is
[52:22] more time for us to live a fulfilled
[52:25] life and if I'm not teaching people
[52:27] about Bitcoin which is one of my great
[52:28] passions I am creating time for myself
[52:31] or creating time for other people so
[52:32] they they can enjoy their passions one
[52:34] of which is music for me but uh that
[52:38] would be my my kind of superpower
[52:40] outside of this is lifestyle design and
[52:44] helping people become more in charge of
[52:46] their their own experience of life and
[52:49] not just living it by default we all get
[52:51] to wake up and choose what our day looks
[52:53] like what our week looks like how we use
[52:55] our time
[52:57] um how far impact goes and I think that
[53:00] aside from stacking more Bitcoin if you
[53:03] can figure out how to organize
[53:05] prioritize and better use your time
[53:07] you're going to have a much more happy
[53:09] and fulfilled life so if I could leave
[53:11] anybody with something to spend some
[53:13] time learning learn how to how to
[53:16] preserve and grow your time because we
[53:17] all have the same amount of it I love
[53:20] that a lot uh and Bitcoin is time is I
[53:24] feel like time is the only thing that is
[53:28] actually way more valuable than than
[53:30] Bitcoin is and it's I I made a recent
[53:32] post and it got some traction um I don't
[53:36] have a lot of Bitcoin to have massive
[53:39] stack I want more time like that it
[53:42] should not be your goal to have as much
[53:45] Bitcoin as possible then you're not not
[53:48] really different to all the Fiat guys
[53:50] that just want to maximize Fiat profits
[53:53] then you just want to maximize Bitcoin
[53:54] profits there's a difference in that but
[53:56] but it's not that much difference but if
[53:59] you really want to just increase your
[54:01] time on Earth your quality time on Earth
[54:04] also like your time you you cannot too
[54:07] much increase but you can better the
[54:09] time that you spend here and and use it
[54:11] not to work uh like 80% of your life for
[54:15] something that you don't even want but
[54:17] maybe only work 10% for something that
[54:20] you don't want and uh spend most of your
[54:22] time actually in in good things even
[54:24] though I always say there are seasons in
[54:26] life and sometimes you have to go uh
[54:28] through a little bit of mud to to go to
[54:30] the
[54:30] beach uh so it's it's uh it's really
[54:33] interesting how to look at that and and
[54:35] and great great and thank you for for
[54:37] that input and it's also you know I
[54:41] think most people when I say getting
[54:42] more time as well think like more time
[54:45] to go sit on the beach or do nothing you
[54:48] know that's great don't get me wrong
[54:50] doing nothing is a a very valuable skill
[54:53] to train yourself to do I'm also a
[54:55] fierce meditator so I think that's it's
[54:57] worthwhile to do nothing but even more
[54:59] so than creating time is is creating the
[55:02] best uses of that time for you so many
[55:04] of us spend a lot of our time doing
[55:06] things that are are far lower value than
[55:08] what we're able to contribute to the
[55:10] world and I think if you get lost doing
[55:14] let's call it the five or $10 an hour
[55:16] tasks that don't feed your soul that
[55:18] don't feed your purpose on this Earth um
[55:21] in favor or you know in in place of
[55:24] doing the things that really light you
[55:26] up up and the things that that can
[55:27] actually contribute to the world around
[55:29] you I think that that's a really a
[55:31] really sad wasted use of life um and so
[55:35] I would really just encourage people
[55:37] that if you are able to build a life
[55:39] that's that's rich in time that you do
[55:42] what is the highest value of that time
[55:44] with the energy that you have and make
[55:46] sure that you're contributing back to
[55:47] the world um spend as much time on the
[55:50] beach as you want but if you're anything
[55:51] like me uh you know retirement is not a
[55:54] concept that I Jive very well with
[55:58] I can get to that because uh I always
[56:02] argue I'm kind of retired because I do
[56:05] every day this podcast I can do every
[56:07] day things in Bitcoin and I really like
[56:10] that there are small portions of me that
[56:12] also have to work do some bookkeeping
[56:16] and do some taxes associated with my
[56:18] business but uh most of my time I can
[56:21] actually spend on great things and even
[56:24] though it's not always easy it's like
[56:26] it's a lot of work also um but uh it's
[56:29] something that I really like and I'm
[56:31] really passionate about it and that's my
[56:33] form of retirement like that's that's
[56:35] like I can
[56:36] do 100% of the time that I want things
[56:39] that I really am passionate about and so
[56:42] that's that's a better form of of
[56:45] retirement because I know um we had some
[56:48] videos about oh how many Bitcoins do you
[56:50] need for for retirement and those videos
[56:53] do really great so I know it's something
[56:57] on the mind of Bitcoin as people that go
[56:59] into Bitcoin but it's I think less about
[57:03] the or I just want to sit on the beach
[57:05] it's more about like oh I want to do
[57:07] every day what I want to do so that that
[57:09] that's always like I think a big
[57:12] distinguish between those I find that
[57:15] the people that have retirement on their
[57:16] minds don't get to do something that
[57:18] they love every day and that instead of
[57:20] retiring they they should just find
[57:22] something that they truly enjoy doing
[57:24] with their time that that contributes
[57:26] and you know everybody's in a different
[57:29] situation I can only speak for myself
[57:31] but it it takes a little bit of effort
[57:33] and and the reward on the back end of of
[57:35] doing the things that you were most
[57:37] suited to do and that you enjoy doing it
[57:39] benefits everybody it's not just you
[57:42] it's everybody who loves you everybody
[57:43] who's in your life uh gets to have a
[57:46] better experience of you and a better
[57:47] experience of the life you create if you
[57:49] are doing what you are here on purpose
[57:51] to do and retirement you know retirement
[57:56] is is a funny concept but if you can
[57:59] just retire to doing what you love um I
[58:01] think that's much more interesting than
[58:03] retiring to doing nothing that's uh it's
[58:05] a very deep inside I love it a lot um we
[58:09] have an intin where the previous guest
[58:11] is asking a question for the next guest
[58:12] without knowing who the next guest
[58:14] actually is and your question from the
[58:16] previous guest is what's the best way of
[58:19] entering a Bitcoin conversation to
[58:22] explain Bitcoin to a
[58:24] Nori H I would I would start by asking
[58:28] the question of what is your greatest
[58:30] Financial pain and that should tell
[58:34] you what someone's biggest issue that
[58:38] they can solve is you know anytime
[58:39] you're in a in a sales process it's less
[58:41] about talking about the thing you're
[58:43] selling and more about figuring out what
[58:45] that person's pain point is so if I were
[58:48] trying to open a conversation with
[58:50] someone you know for me personally I I
[58:54] just hate working with banks I hate all
[58:56] red tape I hate having to move money
[58:58] around and someone call me and ask if
[59:00] I'm if I'm really doing it if it's fraud
[59:03] and then after I say yes you know still
[59:05] not letting me move my money so for me
[59:06] it was a sovereignty thing for someone
[59:09] else they they they might really be
[59:12] their top of- mind conversation would be
[59:15] well I just I don't have any savings
[59:16] anymore like my savings seems to
[59:18] evaporate um so really when you're
[59:21] opening up the conversation I think you
[59:22] need to drill into what the individual's
[59:25] Main pain point with money is and you're
[59:28] going to have to give them a minute
[59:30] because most people don't think that
[59:32] deeply about what their pain point with
[59:34] money is it's one of those abstract
[59:37] Concepts that you know it it just
[59:40] doesn't it doesn't come up enough in
[59:43] everyday conversation unless you live in
[59:45] the Bitcoin world and you're very
[59:46] passionate about talking talking about
[59:47] money and and describing you know the
[59:50] different characteristics of different
[59:51] types of monies it's not something that
[59:53] most people have thought about and so
[59:55] before before you launch into a heavily
[59:58] intellectual TI raade about why one form
[60:01] of money is better than another you
[60:02] should be figuring out what that
[60:04] person's unique pain point is and trying
[60:06] to drill in on if there is a specific
[60:09] part that relates to that individual's
