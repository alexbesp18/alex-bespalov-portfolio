[00:00] we're going to go from here to a million
[00:01] and then 10 million which is ultimately
[00:03] where we going and probably past that
[00:05] which is 100x from here just buy Bitcoin
[00:07] every day or every week the same amount
[00:09] for 4 years you're good your your life
[00:11] is sweet you're sorted you've created
[00:13] generational wealth Larry thing the
[00:15] largest capital allocator in the world
[00:16] come down saying Bitcoin is a flight
[00:18] quality president Donald Trump is going
[00:20] to be the next president of the United
[00:22] States is saying never sell your Bitcoin
[00:24] I've been locked out of my bank account
[00:26] about six times over the last couple of
[00:28] months he who controls the money
[00:29] controls the world when we exit into
[00:32] Bitcoin nobody controls it if the
[00:33] government comes in they're like oh we
[00:35] need to get to a million Bitcoin you've
[00:37] got 500,000 Bitcoin and we're just going
[00:39] to take that they can why risk
[00:42] generational wealth wealth that can
[00:43] survive for thousands and thousands of
[00:45] years as long as there's one node on the
[00:47] network and as long as you're holding
[00:49] your private cues why put that risk
[00:51] nobody's coming to save anyone the
[00:52] government's not here to fix anyone's
[00:54] life they don't nobody else cares about
[00:56] ourselves more than we should care about
[00:58] ourselves
[01:01] [Music]
[01:03] you're one of my first 10 guests that I
[01:06] have on a second time so I usually try
[01:09] to to keep a distance between the first
[01:11] episode and and the second round that I
[01:13] do but you have been I think my 12th
[01:15] guest ever uh one of my first 15
[01:19] definitely and I remember we talked in
[01:21] the first episode around um the the D
[01:24] did join you part the the where are we
[01:28] of like are they fighting us are they
[01:29] love in at us are they joining us part
[01:32] uh and I know uh I'm not exactly sure
[01:35] what you answered but I think you you
[01:37] said something like we not quite yet at
[01:39] the dend chin you part and I think we um
[01:43] recorded before the Bitcoin ETF we
[01:46] definitely recorded before Trump was
[01:48] coming up and all of the sudden talking
[01:49] about Bitcoin uh and all the things that
[01:52] happened in
[01:53] 2024 um where are we right now in the
[01:56] Bitcoin phase how are you looking at
[01:58] Bitcoin right now and how how has
[02:01] Bitcoin changed since we last recorded
[02:04] about a year ago what a great question
[02:08] Robin so then they fight you stage or or
[02:12] then they join you I I think we're
[02:15] probably still somewhere in in between
[02:17] like Elizabeth Warren has become vocal
[02:21] once once again I thought with
[02:23] everything that was going on with Trump
[02:25] they would have just left us alone gone
[02:28] a little bit quiet it's not doing h any
[02:30] favors uh I believe I saw something from
[02:32] Jamie Diamond a couple of weeks ago as
[02:34] well so that's like then they fight you
[02:37] it's the same people they're still being
[02:39] really argumentative with us but since
[02:41] then like you're right Robin we have had
[02:43] the the ETF Black Rock Larry think the
[02:46] the largest capital allocator in the
[02:48] world come down saying Bitcoin is a
[02:50] flight equality and then president
[02:52] Donald Trump like whatever you think of
[02:54] the guy is going to be the next
[02:56] president of the United States is saying
[02:59] never sell your bit coin that's that's
[03:01] absolutely massive and will you know
[03:05] Trump came out and he he's talked about
[03:07] a strategic Bitcoin reserve and that
[03:09] really the conversation started heading
[03:11] off with Cynthia alumnus and RFK and
[03:14] Trump's run with it I think for
[03:16] ramaswami got into to his ear there but
[03:20] if he really goes through with that and
[03:22] say they buy a million Bitcoin over the
[03:25] next five years then they're definitely
[03:28] here but are a couple of things to be
[03:31] very careful about with that and I think
[03:33] we can dive into that a little bit later
[03:35] in the conversation so I think we're
[03:37] sort of still like at the then they
[03:38] fight you stage but we're slowly
[03:40] creeping over to like it's freaking
[03:42] party time man and it's uh I I think
[03:46] it's very very exciting and the Overton
[03:48] Windows 100% shifted since their last
[03:52] conversation really interesting um I
[03:54] think it's also highly depends on on on
[03:57] where you look because in in America
[04:00] the inofficial president Larry fing and
[04:02] the official president with Donald Trump
[04:04] soon to be the official president now
[04:07] President elect are at least from the
[04:10] outside for Bitcoin I don't know what
[04:12] they actually think about Bitcoin uh but
[04:15] they definitely have an incentive to be
[04:16] now uh for Bitcoin but if you look to
[04:19] Europe I don't know how it's in in
[04:21] Australia but in Europe it's a whole
[04:23] different uh game where the all the
[04:26] politicians are still either quiet about
[04:28] it uh because they're they're afraid to
[04:30] speak up about Bitcoin they are only
[04:33] rare uh outside politicians that
[04:35] actually speak up about Bitcoin and
[04:37] being pro Bitcoin but the the
[04:39] politicians in power they usually like
[04:41] ah it's a bad thing or we don't want it
[04:44] or we we just don't talk about that so
[04:46] Europe is lagging behind just with the
[04:48] internet did did uh and and now with
[04:51] with Bitcoin again how do you see the
[04:53] the global game the now playing out and
[04:55] maybe how it's also in Australia going
[04:57] on and and America seems to be once
[05:00] again ahead of the game and going a
[05:03] little bit faster than the other uh
[05:05] bigger
[05:07] States yeah I think America's a little
[05:09] bit interesting we're actually not going
[05:10] to know what America does until Trump
[05:13] gets into office and what he does in his
[05:15] first 100 days at the moment it's some
[05:18] really positive messaging really amazing
[05:21] conversations around it and people are
[05:23] saying if Trump doesn't do it they're
[05:24] going to launch a civil action uh
[05:27] lawsuit against him to make sure that he
[05:29] imp a strategic Bitcoin Reserve I
[05:32] believe with people like Jason Lear who
[05:34] wrote softw War probably in
[05:38] VI in Trump's air and talking with
[05:41] policy makers as well as Dennis Porter
[05:44] there's a really really good chance that
[05:46] they do do it whether it's a million
[05:47] coins or not if it's just they hold on
[05:49] to the coins at the moment so so that's
[05:52] one thing definitely America's heading
[05:54] in the right right
[05:56] direction Australia is a very
[05:58] interesting place the things that they
[06:01] have in place are fairly favorable
[06:03] actually to to bitcoin so we've got one
[06:06] of the ETFs is the monochrome ETF and
[06:09] I'm not for buying the ETF I just like
[06:11] Bitcoin and self custody but say the
[06:13] monochrome ETF for example they approved
[06:16] it it's on the CBO Stock Exchange you
[06:19] can p pay a $500 fee and you can
[06:21] withdraw your Bitcoin into self- custody
[06:24] so that's something that's really good
[06:27] it's very Bitcoin focused and f u which
[06:30] is the the CEO of monochrome I've had
[06:33] him on the show and and talked to him he
[06:35] seems like a very Bitcoin focused person
[06:38] so for the ETF to have an ETF where you
[06:41] have the option to be able to take into
[06:42] self custody that's very Bitcoin focused
[06:45] that's really incredible and that's a an
[06:48] exit ramp or an off-ramp out of the
[06:50] traditional system into Bitcoin which is
[06:53] this parallel system that that has being
[06:55] built that allows people to gain self-
[06:57] sovereignty Freedom as well as that
[06:59] they've classed Bitcoin here as as
[07:02] property it would be better if it was
[07:04] classed as currency and there wouldn't
[07:06] be capital gains but by classing it is
[07:09] property we've got the rule of law
[07:12] around it now as well and if you hold it
[07:15] for longer than a year like not
[07:16] Financial advice people talk to your
[07:18] accountant but if you hold it for longer
[07:20] than a year capital gains tax discount
[07:22] applies so you're only paying your
[07:24] nominal tax rate on 50% of the profits
[07:27] whereas if you're to sell it in under a
[07:29] year you'd pay your nominal tax rate and
[07:31] 100% of the profits which is really cool
[07:35] so that's sort of like
[07:36] favorable but the media when the media
[07:40] is talking about it so that's like
[07:41] what's there in the institutions and
[07:43] these exist and the rich wealthy
[07:45] Financial Elite that are paying
[07:47] attention to the markets they can see
[07:49] that those exit ramps exist but what the
[07:51] mainstream media is doing it's still
[07:53] magic internet money it's really bad for
[07:55] the environment there's a lot of gas
[07:57] light and a lot of misinformation
[07:58] disinformation
[08:00] going around about it which is pretty
[08:02] interesting I don't know if you heard
[08:03] about that misinformation disinformation
[08:05] Bill they're trying to push through um
[08:08] basically as just an attack on Free
[08:09] Speech they wanted to stop people
[08:12] warning that the banks were may not hold
[08:14] hold funds that they're um not 100%
[08:18] backed well basically you can talk about
[08:21] about the banks any any bad light for
[08:24] whatever reason even if it was true uh
[08:26] which is pretty interesting that all the
[08:29] Authority was the mainstream media that
[08:31] got shut down which is good
[08:34] um but it feels like mainstream media
[08:37] here in Australia is probably a little
[08:40] bit more powerful or more people watch
[08:42] as a percentage and they really buy
[08:45] these lies so the general public like
[08:48] the the people that that I care about it
[08:51] at least what we would call plebs not
[08:53] the ultra high net worth individuals
[08:55] they're sweet but the people that are
[08:57] just going to an 9 to5 rocking up at
[09:00] work every single day they're tuned into
[09:03] the radio they hear bitcoin's magic
[09:05] internet money it's a Ponzi scheme it's
[09:06] a scam and they tune out and it's
[09:10] literally which is so sad because it's
[09:12] the solution to all their problems we've
[09:13] got massive amounts of inflation here
[09:15] like in every area of our life they
[09:18] they're talking about like our the
[09:19] Australian dollar is worth about 60
[09:21] cents compared to the US dollar they
[09:23] reckon that could drop down to 50 50
[09:26] cents um in a short period of time the
[09:29] is there the answer is here it's Bitcoin
[09:31] but they're sort of trying to distract
[09:34] people and then over in Europe and
[09:36] stuff you know I'm so far removed and
[09:39] really focused on Australia and the us
[09:41] but what I find very interesting is I
[09:43] was talking about it this morning is
[09:46] they're same as Australia they're
[09:48] working on a central bank digital
[09:50] currency what they're talking about with
[09:52] the Central Bank digital currency is
[09:54] putting holding limits on it so you can
[09:57] only hold so much and then they're
[09:58] talking about if like you reach that
[10:00] maybe it's say for example $10,000 in
[10:03] the Central Bank digital currency
[10:05] they'll automatically convert it to a
[10:07] bank account and and put it into Fiat
[10:10] which is strange I'm not sure where
[10:12] they're going with that but they're also
[10:14] the the conversation around privacy the
[10:17] point of a cbdc is to have total control
[10:20] total awareness around it but then
[10:22] they're talking about using the payment
[10:24] rails and other people will be able to
[10:25] build on top of it and there's like a
[10:29] real brief ambiguous article but sound
[10:32] like people can build their own mediums
[10:34] of exchange or things on there so it's
[10:36] like they're trying to take all the
[10:38] power away from this decentralized
[10:40] network that is Bitcoin and offer
[10:43] something else that will be legal it'll
[10:45] be backed by the state the government
[10:48] government's approved and they're going
[10:50] to push that but and I do hear they they
[10:54] make it pretty hard just coming back to
[10:56] Australia and I guess this the final
[10:57] point so while like
[11:00] um the stock market and the tax laws are
[11:03] fairly favorable the banks here are not
[11:07] like I've been locked out of my bank
[11:08] account about six times over the last
[11:10] couple of months with one of my bank
[11:12] accounts I limit you to $10,000 a month
[11:15] into Bitcoin or they say cryptocurrency
[11:18] they they throw them all in together
[11:20] which is absolutely absurd um it I I
[11:25] understand because I've read the books
[11:26] that when we deposit money with a bank
[11:28] account we have an IOU on that money we
[11:30] don't own the money it's up to them at
[11:32] their discretion whether we can use it
[11:34] or not most people aren't aware and when
[11:37] people are trying to exit because they
[11:39] hear about Bitcoin they finally
[11:40] understood they've put in the proof of
[11:42] work they realize that this is the
[11:43] solution to pretty much all their
[11:45] problems maybe not all of them but
[11:47] pretty much most of them and they want
[11:49] to go all into Bitcoin they're limited
[11:51] to
[11:52] $120,000 per year that's it you can't
[11:55] even buy one Bitcoin here in Australia
[11:56] for $120,000 anymore it's like
[11:59] 50,000 um and that's one bank account
[12:03] and more other banks are doing that as
[12:06] well and they're just making it very
[12:08] hard to be able to exit that system
[12:10] they'll put 24 48h hour delays someone
[12:13] very close to me got locked out of their
[12:15] bank account for 28 days trying to move
[12:17] funds into to bitcoin um as well so here
[12:23] in Australia definitely the then they
[12:25] fight you stage I think for the average
[12:27] person I think for the high net worth
[12:28] indiv uals that have a good financial
[12:31] advisor they're uh they're pretty sweet
[12:33] and those exit ramps do do exist but I
[12:35] just whether it's conspiracy or a
[12:38] coincidence they they're not letting the
[12:39] everyday person know absolutely and it's
[12:43] the same in in AUST just can have a a
[12:47] small um small anecdote about that
[12:49] because I have a bank account and from
[12:52] that bank account it's consistently just
[12:54] going up to my uh to to bitcoin and um
[13:00] there was no problem with that but one
[13:02] day I got a call from from my boss uh I
[13:05] think like a year or one and a half
[13:07] years ago oh don't know it's now even
[13:09] two years ago um because I'm already
[13:11] working one year in Bitcoin um and and
[13:14] he basically said hey uh the um
[13:17] transaction couldn't go through uh the
[13:18] salary couldn't go through to you
[13:20] because your bank account has been
[13:21] flaged and I called the
[13:25] B and I called the bank and they like oh
[13:28] yeah yeah we thought you you got robbed
[13:31] out of your bank account because there
[13:32] are so many uh um uh transactions to
[13:36] bitcoin and exchanges and I'm like what
[13:40] like yeah I did that and and even if
[13:44] even if you're concerned about that
[13:46] please inform me that's yeah that's
[13:48] right don't just shut down my
[13:50] bank yeah in my case they did not shut
[13:53] it down but they just like flagged me as
[13:56] a as a bad account and then uh people
[13:59] cannot transfer money to me uh without
[14:02] um providing a phone call uh because the
[14:06] my bank account has been flagged as bad
[14:08] just because I uh transferred something
[14:11] to
[14:12] bitcoin and then that's that's just
[14:14] reality that that's just something that
[14:17] exists I don't know if it still exists
[14:19] it's two years now uh maybe that changed
[14:22] and I also think as you said the the the
[14:24] climate um narrative I feel like since
[14:28] this year here it really goes down a
[14:30] little bit I don't hear a lot about the
[14:32] climate narrative Bitcoin being bad for
[14:34] environment it's still here uh but I
[14:38] feel like since black rock is here it
[14:40] actually changed a little bit and the
[14:42] narrative is kind of also in the
[14:44] mainstream media I don't know at least
[14:46] in in Europe uh a little bit changing
[14:49] there's also a lot of um uh lobbying now
[14:53] going on for Bitcoin in Europe and
[14:55] there's like terahash and other
[14:56] companies that really try to talk with
[14:59] politicians uh and inform them about
[15:01] Bitcoin about the actual facts and how
[15:03] Bitcoin money actually works that's
[15:05] really great like uh Rachel guy you
[15:07] probably know uh she's behind that also
[15:10] uh and that's that's really great that
[15:12] we moving slowly to direct to that
[15:15] direction but they're still fighting us
[15:18] they they're still in
[15:19] likey we don't want that we they should
[15:22] stay with us in the feat system they
[15:24] should not go out in that Bitcoin uh
[15:26] they should not as Trump said play with
[15:28] the Bitcoin should play with their feat
[15:30] only yeah and and and have fun stay
[15:33] staying poor and that's basically the
[15:34] result if you stay in that feat system
[15:37] if you're you're holding cash and it
[15:40] reminds me of that saying Robin like he
[15:42] who controls the money controls the
[15:44] world when we exit into Bitcoin nobody
[15:48] controls it we control the money so we
[15:50] can control our own world they don't
[15:51] want people to be self-empowered they
[15:54] want to stay self-empowered and they
[15:55] want to control everyone but that's the
[15:57] the the the grandness of bitcoin's
[16:01] design is it gives you 100% self-
[16:05] responsibility which is scary like I
[16:07] understand that especially for the first
[16:09] time say
[16:11] somebody had a million dollars or
[16:13] whatever sitting in cash you convince
[16:15] them to buy one Bitcoin on an exchange
[16:17] they do that
[16:19] $150,000 Australian and you're like okay
[16:21] now you need to hold it on a USB device
[16:24] if you lose those words that you're
[16:26] written down on a piece of paper and
[16:27] that device fails you're going to lose
[16:29] it all and then they send it and you're
[16:32] like if you send it to the wrong
[16:34] address you're not getting it back
[16:36] either you're going to lose it like
[16:38] those things that's the reality of
[16:40] Bitcoin and of course there's education
[16:43] and it's really not that hard it's just
[16:45] something to learn but like until you
[16:47] learn that like you're hearing all those
[16:48] things you're like oh that's so scary
[16:50] maybe I don't want to take self
[16:51] responsibility but when people actually
[16:53] show up and they front up and they do
[16:55] take that self responsibility they're
[16:57] like oh nobody take it they can't
[16:59] confiscate it they can't debase it they
[17:01] can't sense to me they can't get in the
[17:03] way no government institution entity
[17:05] person full stop can get in the way of
[17:08] me using my Bitcoin for whatever I want
[17:10] and I can have fun playing with my
[17:12] Bitcoin like that gives them full power
[17:14] to be able to take control of every
[17:16] aspect of their life but I understand
[17:19] like that that first step is a little
[17:20] bit bit scary and politicians government
[17:24] or whatever of course they're G to play
[17:26] on on that like this is safe if
[17:29] something happens like that bank $10,000
[17:32] a month here in Australia Commonwealth
[17:36] Bank is the name of it they I think is
[17:39] like four weekends ago were like double
[17:42] spending in people's accounts that's why
[17:43] bank accounts were created to stop
[17:46] double spending to have a middleman in
[17:47] the way but that was happening and then
[17:50] people's debts were still there but say
[17:52] they had like $20,000 or $100,000 in
[17:55] savings that was not showing up at at
[17:57] all and they're like saying trust us
[18:00] we're safe it's all good don't don't do
[18:02] that because we can reverse and they fix
[18:04] it but you're like okay you can fix it
[18:07] until you can there's a major Bank Run
[18:08] or you inflate the dollars
[18:10] away absolutely and I understand why
[18:14] it's especially for new newcomers um
[18:17] hard and I talked to some people that on
[18:20] on conferences that actually came in
[18:21] 2024 to bitcoin uh uh because you come
[18:25] from the fear system where you have
[18:26] absolutely no power like you you are
[18:29] completely at the discretion of the bank
[18:31] they can decide whatever they want to do
[18:33] with your money uh and then to come to
[18:35] bitcoin where you have all the power so
[18:37] like you you go from zero to one uh and
[18:40] it's it's it's a big move there's like
[18:42] not as small moves in between there's
[18:44] like a the biggest jump you can possibly
[18:47] make from no power to all the power uh
[18:50] that's why you you see also a lot of
[18:53] mistakes happened uh you see also a lot
[18:55] of Bitcoin lost and and and especially
[18:57] in the early days I now it actually gets
[18:59] better because there are just so many uh
[19:02] products advisories Services out there
[19:04] that makes it uh way better than it used
[19:07] to be like 5 years ago 10 years ago and
[19:10] definitely 12 to 15 years ago uh so it's
[19:14] it gets better but it's still a huge
[19:17] jump and when I talk with uh newcomers
[19:21] that uh are only in field right now they
[19:24] think Bitcoin is a really interesting
[19:26] idea and they want to get in but just
[19:28] that h of like what what is what is seed
[19:30] phrase like what the heck is that like
[19:32] why do I need that I I I'm just used to
[19:34] username and password now all of the
[19:36] sudden they need a seed thread like what
[19:39] is that private key like I need D St
[19:42] with public Keys also like there's so
[19:44] much going on uh with self- custody um
[19:48] where they they never dealt with it and
[19:51] my hope is that uh key management in
[19:55] general uh will be hopefully implemented
[19:58] in in more apps and might be uh the
[20:02] future of how we get into also
[20:05] centralized apps how we maybe log in to
[20:08] um a social media account or log in into
[20:10] other things uh and I think the only
[20:13] crowd that actually is um on onto the
[20:17] same crowd than than Bitcoin is because
[20:19] it was in there is the it security crowd
[20:21] they also uh see the the the private key
[20:25] um as an entry to to platforms to
[20:28] applications as the best way to to
[20:31] secure that they know that username and
[20:33] password is an old model that we have to
[20:37] kind of replace uh how do you see uh
[20:40] that the private key management and
[20:42] especially self- custody the importance
[20:44] uh of it in this day and AG where people
[20:46] are distracted with micro strategy
[20:48] they're distracted with ETFs and and all
[20:50] those
[20:51] things yeah if I can speak to the the
[20:55] last Point first Robin self Cy I think
[20:58] it is is the most important thing
[21:01] Bitcoin is number go up to technology
[21:04] like there is no undenying that if you
[21:06] hold it for four years even if you buy
[21:09] it at the top after a 4year period the
[21:11] least it's done as 100% return some
[21:14] people are talking about diminishing
[21:16] returns I actually believe there's more
[21:17] upside in front of us than than behind
[21:20] us but over time Bitcoin is going to go
[21:23] up so that's one aspect of Bitcoin
[21:26] that's what most people focus on but the
[21:28] revolution of Bitcoin is that it is the
[21:31] first time in human history where we can
[21:33] take 100% self- custody of a bearer
[21:36] asset of a bearer instrument a monetary
[21:38] asset that does come with everything
[21:40] that we're talking about that fear that
[21:42] uncertainty there's someone the Bitcoin
[21:45] way we've both partnered with on our
[21:47] channels respectively educating people
[21:49] Tony comes from a cyber security
[21:52] background he used to work for Steve
[21:53] Jobs um literally like the best person
[21:57] in the world and the team around him to
[21:59] be able to step people through that
[22:01] process to be able to Fast Track and and
[22:04] help him or there's amazing resources
[22:07] out on the internet like BTC sessions on
[22:09] YouTube and like his
[22:11] tutorials if people have got time on
[22:13] their hands to be able to learn it do
[22:16] that if you don't have time like pay for
[22:18] the Bitcoin way or or pay for somebody
[22:20] that's already gone through and they've
[22:23] stuffed up maybe they've sent their
[22:25] Bitcoin and they they've burnt it or
[22:27] they sent it to the wrong address or
[22:29] whatever the only way that Humanity
[22:32] progresses is by failing forward or
[22:34] learning from our mistakes the best
[22:36] thing is though they don't need to be
[22:37] our mistakes and bitcoin's got now 16
[22:40] years of History so there are like so
[22:42] many trials and tribulations and things
[22:44] like that to be able to help fast fast
[22:47] track but coming back to the point
[22:49] whether you pay someone to do it you
[22:51] watch BTC sessions or you figure it out
[22:53] yourself by reading the books reading
[22:54] articles on online asking the community
[22:58] you have to do it say like say you're
[23:02] holding micro strategy because it's 3
[23:04] to1 Bitcoin or whatever it's leverage
[23:07] play cool that's that's great but if the
[23:10] government comes in they're like oh we
[23:13] we need to get to a million Bitcoin
[23:15] you've got 500,000 Bitcoin and we're
[23:17] just going to take that they can I'm not
[23:20] going to say that will happen but it
[23:22] could happen same with Wall Street Black
[23:25] Rock all the ETFs it prob won't but why
[23:30] risk generational wealth wealth that can
[23:32] survive for thousands and thousands of
[23:35] years as long as there's one node on the
[23:37] network and as long as you're holding
[23:39] your private cuys like why put that risk
[23:41] because you need to spend 5 10 15 20
[23:44] hours by yourself or or two hours with
[23:47] an expert to be able to learn to do it I
[23:50] I think it's
[23:52] like like if anyone just take away just
[23:55] please get your Bitcoin into self
[23:57] custody run your own no
[23:59] and when your net worth grows learn
[24:01] about multisig but you don't need to do
[24:03] it all at once you can just slowly step
[24:05] like most important and then talking I
[24:08] think the other part of your question
[24:10] Robin was like what are my thoughts on
[24:13] micro strategy and the Black Rock
[24:16] ETF I
[24:18] think when especially when the Black
[24:20] Rock ETF first came out you know black
[24:22] Rock's not the most trusted institution
[24:25] in the world they're the L largest
[24:26] Capital allocator but they've definitely
[24:28] been up to some dodgy stuff in the past
[24:31] with buying a whole lot of Housing and
[24:33] stuff and maybe not dodgy they're
[24:35] playing within the rules of the law but
[24:38] the rule of law favors the the rich the
[24:42] financial Elite already so if black
[24:44] rocks coming in and they're scooping up
[24:45] a whole lot of houses and stuff they're
[24:47] pushing up rental prices for people that
[24:49] are living week to week that's one of
[24:52] the reasons why I so vocal against the
[24:54] ETF and then the second reason is not
[24:56] your keys not your coins like control
[24:58] the keys it only gives you access to the
[25:02] number go up for as long as they or the
[25:05] government wants to give you access and
[25:07] maybe that goes on forever maybe it's
[25:08] not a problem but I'm not willing to
[25:11] risk it for myself so like at the start
[25:14] was so vocal against it however
[25:18] personally I still wouldn't do it I I
[25:20] wouldn't hold in any ETF even say like
[25:22] the the ibit ETF here in Australia where
[25:24] you can pay a $500 fee and you can get
[25:26] your Bitcoin out simp because I do know
[25:29] how to self cting and it's easy enough
[25:31] and we've still got those exit ramps at
[25:32] the moment but for potentially in
[25:36] Australia it's so easy as a like for
[25:39] your retirement account as a
[25:41] self-managed super fund to hold real
[25:43] Bitcoin but potentially in the US and I
[25:46] don't know their system if you can
[25:48] choose where you invest your retirement
[25:51] money whether it's called a pension or a
[25:55] um 401k account whatever you call it an
[25:58] anywhere in the world if they won't
[26:00] allow you to self- custody Bitcoin it
[26:02] may still make sense to buy the ETF to
[26:06] have exposure to the number go up side
[26:08] of things if if you can't allocate that
[26:11] money to holding physical Bitcoin so I I
[26:14] think they have a part to play also like
[26:17] with with Wall Street and
[26:19] stuff coming in it has given a lot of
[26:24] credibility and respect like we're not
[26:27] worried about Gary gendler at the SEC
[26:30] being like bitcoin's a security or
[26:33] whatever like it's legal now it's not
[26:36] we're not going to wake up one day and
[26:38] it's legal to hold hold Bitcoin they
[26:40] could come out and say it's legal to
[26:41] hold Bitcoin self cussy people like cool
[26:44] I don't own in self cussy I went boting
[26:46] like like what the [ __ ] are you going to
[26:48] do like excuse my language but if it's
[26:50] in self cussy it really doesn't matter
[26:52] what games they play or what they do and
[26:55] don't do you just have control and yes
[26:58] it's scary yes you need to take a bit of
[27:00] self- responsibility but nobody's coming
[27:03] to save anyone the government's not here
[27:05] to fix anyone's life they don't nobody
[27:08] else cares about ourselves more than we
[27:10] should care about ourselves so when we
[27:12] do that it's pretty bloody and power and
[27:15] and really you become ungovernable
[27:18] Untouchable um 100% And um I I I try to
[27:22] push that as much as possible because I
[27:24] know there are still a lot of big
[27:26] portion of the audience uh too big of a
[27:29] portion of the audience that just
[27:30] doesn't do self custody even though they
[27:32] could do it uh with all the different
[27:36] excuses one thing that that I hear this
[27:38] year uh a lot which uh you also touched
[27:42] on micro strategy it kind of reminds me
[27:45] of the past Cycles with altcoins where
[27:48] people said like oh no like I I get
[27:50] Bitcoin I really like Bitcoin but but I
[27:52] want to get more Bitcoin so I invest in
[27:54] that xyc altcoin I actually don't hear
[27:57] that that this cycle maybe my Bitcoin
[28:00] bubble just is is not too too big so I
[28:03] don't hear that altcoin things but what
[28:05] I hear is like I know like I I take half
[28:07] my Bitcoin and invest in micro strategy
[28:09] to have outperform Bitcoin and in the
[28:12] end get more Bitcoin um is it's kind of
[28:15] I don't know maybe it's a crazy Theory
[28:18] but is micro strategy kind of the
[28:20] distraction of Bitcoin inself cly
[28:23] because it's like that Bitcoin blade mic
[28:25] sale is a big figure in Bitcoin is that
[28:27] could that be a distraction for for bit
[28:31] people if they haven't achieved their
[28:34] stacking goal whether it's getting to
[28:36] one Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin or 100 or a
[28:38] thousand Bitcoin whatever it
[28:41] is my belief and it's their money like
[28:43] it's your money it's your choice anyone
[28:45] watching this like do what you want and
[28:49] live with the consequences or live with
[28:51] the rewards take 100% self-
[28:53] responsibility I don't care my bitcoin's
[28:55] in self custody I'm good what would like
[28:58] people to do because the more people
[29:00] that hold Bitcoin and self- custody the
[29:02] faster we get a better world the more
[29:04] time everyone gets back the more freedom
[29:07] like the quicker that we can move into
[29:08] this parallel system one thing I find
[29:12] interesting with micro strategy what's
[29:14] Michael sailor say you're better off to
[29:16] buy Bitcoin like he he's saying that buy
[29:20] Bitcoin if it me I'd buy Bitcoin what
[29:22] sailor do he sells his shares and he
[29:25] buys Bitcoin and we think he buys
[29:26] Bitcoin like
[29:29] okay what is micro strategy it's
[29:31] leverage Play What a leverage play is
[29:33] good for people that understand
[29:34] financial markets people say like fred
[29:37] Krueger that have been in traditional
[29:39] Finance for for their whole lives they
[29:41] really understand or or someone like um
[29:45] yeah like that's really focused in on
[29:47] that maybe it's a good to play and for
[29:50] everyone else some people are going to
[29:52] get extremely lucky like it's up 740 I
[29:55] think in the last 12 months um where
[29:58] bitcoin's up like
[30:00] 140% those numbers may be a little bit
[30:02] wrong but it's like something about that
[30:03] it's like 5x on on bitcoin's
[30:07] performance that's good but my strong
[30:11] belief and again like do as you will if
[30:13] people haven't gone to their stacking
[30:14] goal like everything else is a
[30:18] distraction and I'd be listening to what
[30:20] Michael sailor himself is is saying is
[30:22] you are better off to buy Bitcoin
[30:26] because there is going to get a Time and
[30:28] and I think very quickly you know Tony
[30:30] from the Bitcoin Wayne says potentially
[30:32] within the next year people are not
[30:33] going to be able to buy Bitcoin so they
[30:35] can make all these gains in micro
[30:37] strategy and the hopes that they can get
[30:39] out before the top because it is
[30:41] leverage so it's going to go up fast but
[30:43] it's also going to come down a lot
[30:44] harder a lot faster a lot quicker is my
[30:47] expectation and that's fine like you can
[30:49] try time the top that's cool but if
[30:53] you're trying to pull out at the top and
[30:55] there's no Bitcoin anywhere to buy like
[30:58] what are you going to do like yes well
[31:00] done you you've made fat and now you're
[31:03] stuck in a stock that's falling harder
[31:05] than Bitcoin so you're worse off I I I
[31:08] don't know I just don't want to have any
[31:10] risk in in my life in any way when it
[31:13] comes to to wealth and I guess there's
[31:15] two ways to approach it number one as an
[31:17] investor or number two as a saver I'm
[31:19] not here to invest I'm just here to save
[31:21] my time then provide value to the world
[31:23] and like get up and carry on with with
[31:25] my day if someone wants to invest and
[31:28] spend day and day out looking at charts
[31:30] and and what saor doing and and the
[31:32] green dots that he puts out every
[31:34] weekend at the moment with a five
[31:36] billion buy attached like that's that's
[31:39] cool but for me Bitcoin it's just it's
[31:42] cheat code man it's easy earn Fe it send
[31:46] it to The Exchange buy Bitcoin move it
[31:49] to a hardware wallet that's it and I
[31:52] don't need to worry about up down or
[31:54] sideways I know one Bitcoin is going to
[31:55] be one Bitcoin I partnered up with coin
[32:00] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[32:03] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[32:05] created by anyone look at that beauty I

[32:48] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:51] love those watches so so much if you
[32:54] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[32:56] regular basis I I guess you already
[32:58] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:01] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[33:04] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:07] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:08] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[33:11] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[33:29] to really level up your sovereignty as
[33:31] an individual you have to have the most
[33:34] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:37] secure your own devices you have to
[33:39] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:42] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:45] where you live you even want to have a
[33:47] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:50] in case something goes really really
[33:52] wrong and through all those steps the

[34:06] out how you can level up your
[34:09] sovereignty yeah that's that's a great
[34:11] Point actually because um I come from
[34:13] the stock world I come from the world of
[34:16] investing in stocks and uh one thing I
[34:18] definitely want to say if if you have
[34:21] Bitcoin you have to do your research
[34:22] once but you don't actually have to keep
[34:24] up with the news too much like if you're
[34:26] just like oh I I I know why Bitcoin is
[34:29] valuable um there you don't have to keep
[34:32] up every day with the news or what what
[34:34] what people are saying about
[34:36] Bitcoin that's different for stocks if
[34:39] you're buying a stock um and that's a
[34:42] fair game and and I probably get back to
[34:45] stocks in like five 10 years when
[34:47] Bitcoin is more mature and and maybe the
[34:49] the diminishing returns is actually
[34:51] hitting I also like you I don't think
[34:53] right nowmining returns is is just BS uh
[34:57] we we about to hit that uh suddenly
[34:59] phase but maybe a little bit after the
[35:02] suddenly phase maybe with like 10% of
[35:04] the net worth I play a little bit around
[35:06] with with stocks because it's a lot of
[35:08] fun for me and I was into that before uh
[35:11] but what you have to do is to research
[35:13] that stock and you have to keep up with
[35:15] the news you have to keep up what the
[35:16] management team is saying you have to
[35:18] keep up what the CEO is saying and what
[35:20] they're doing and listen to the the
[35:22] podcast they doing so it's it's it's a
[35:25] it's a work like being an investor in
[35:27] companies
[35:28] uh it's not passive you have to stay
[35:31] active you have to keep up with
[35:32] everything and it's a part-time job that
[35:35] you're doing and I opted out of that
[35:37] game uh knowingly that I I will opt in
[35:40] that game again once it uh it makes
[35:42] sense for me right now nothing else than
[35:46] just Bitcoin inself cust it makes sense
[35:48] in my opinion uh and so keep that in
[35:51] mind if you invest in micro strategy
[35:53] you're not in investing in a leverage
[35:55] Bitcoin play You're investing in a
[35:57] company
[35:58] with management teams with uh
[36:00] centralized um uh risks and there's a
[36:03] great video that Mich actually did um
[36:06] about the risks of different assets I
[36:09] think he went through stocks real estate
[36:11] and some other assets of like what are
[36:13] the risks involved and I think he gives
[36:16] like a 30 minute answer to what are the
[36:18] risks involved with any company uh just
[36:21] listen to that 30 minutes and then maybe
[36:24] uh rethink of like how how how much you
[36:27] really want to invest in a stock even if
[36:29] it's micro strategy and even if it's a
[36:31] Bitcoin play and how much you want to be
[36:33] in in a Bitcoin self custody but as Sean
[36:36] said it's it's your money it's your
[36:37] decision in the end of the day uh but I
[36:40] just know what what I like to do yeah Ju
[36:43] Just to add on to that Robin as well and
[36:46] people like do as you will it's it's
[36:48] your life I I I truly understand because
[36:51] my own lived experiences focusing on
[36:53] bitcoin and self codyy my life's amazing
[36:56] and it continues to get better and the
[36:59] reason being is because Bitcoin is
[37:01] numberg go up technology when it's in
[37:03] self Cassy it's Freedom technology as
[37:05] well but every time we buy Bitcoin we're
[37:08] like leveraging future free time that we
[37:12] have like in the
[37:14] future um so if people are coming into
[37:18] it the way that I approach it from a
[37:20] saver I'm I'm saving the work that I do
[37:22] today so that I have more time in the
[37:24] future by focusing on Bitcoin now
[37:27] getting to the goal whether it's
[37:30] 0.111 100 500,000 like Sor like whatever
[37:34] that stack goal is then you've got time
[37:38] the capacity like you're saying Robin
[37:40] it's a part-time job investing like sort
[37:43] your timeout first and Bitcoin sorts
[37:45] your time out first and then once you've
[37:47] done that then you can go play with with
[37:50] what whatever it is until then do as you
[37:53] will but for me it's just eyes on the
[37:56] prize 100 % um you also said it and I
[38:00] said it also with the diminishing
[38:02] returns uh there's a lot of theories out
[38:04] there that say uh there will come
[38:07] diminishing returns uh sales model is
[38:10] kind of like that uh there is the power
[38:12] law that is kind of following that same
[38:14] Trend um I have a hard time believing
[38:17] that uh if we see that we are so small
[38:21] and so early and we're seeing those
[38:23] rapid um developments right now with the
[38:26] Strategic Reserve that we could that hit
[38:28] that suddenly phase and I just talked a
[38:30] few episodes ago with par leis about uh
[38:34] when are we hitting the suddenly phase
[38:36] what what does he look at uh when we
[38:38] come from gradually done suddenly
[38:40] because I think we're still in the
[38:41] gradually uh phase um how do you look at
[38:45] the the future development adoption rate
[38:48] of
[38:49] Bitcoin there's this word Robin That's
[38:51] thr around all the time game
[38:54] theory when Game Theory plays out baby
[38:58] like mate holy cow like literally the
[39:01] most powerful country in the world
[39:03] militarily wise economically is the
[39:07] United States that whether it happens or
[39:10] not they're talking about a Bitcoin
[39:11] strategic Reserve asset instead of
[39:14] holding gold as a strategic Reserve
[39:16] asset which has been done for thousands
[39:18] of years bitcoin's only 15 16 years old
[39:21] now and it's at a$ 1.89 M trillion
[39:24] dollar market cap today the the World
[39:26] Monetary supplies like 900
[39:29] trillion to think that if they go out
[39:33] and actually start accumulating a
[39:35] million Bitcoin we're not just going to
[39:38] go like this and then when other
[39:40] countries see that we start going like
[39:42] this then we just keep going up and up
[39:44] and up like batan was mining like1 point
[39:47] something billion dollars in Bitcoin
[39:48] secretly before they um got found out I
[39:53] I'm pretty convinced that the UAE is
[39:56] buying Bitcoin already there's so many
[40:00] countries and conversations going on
[40:02] around the world like the the work that
[40:04] Samson m is doing in Orange ply nation
[40:07] states these conversations are already
[40:10] happening and they've been happening for
[40:11] many years but I think like the Catalyst
[40:14] of Vette getting into Trump's ear of
[40:16] saying hey you need to talk about
[40:18] Bitcoin and then Bitcoin becoming like a
[40:19] presidential topic for the most powerful
[40:22] country in the world when the whole
[40:25] world is suffering from inflation due to
[40:27] what happened in
[40:29] 2020 and and there's like individual
[40:32] people doing it like I don't know about
[40:34] you Robin but like just as a little bit
[40:36] of a side quest for a moment it took me
[40:39] four and a bit years to Orange Peel my
[40:42] mom it took me so so so long man and
[40:47] then every week I call her up hey ma'am
[40:49] like you got to buy Bitcoin hey ma'am
[40:50] you got to read this book like read
[40:52] parallel read Bitcoin evangelis read
[40:54] beers for Bitcoin watch this podcast you
[40:56] know I've got a podcast show so I was
[40:57] just like like watch this listen to this
[40:59] podcast with this person this what's
[41:01] going on in the news and like really
[41:03] tapped in wouldn't happen wouldn't
[41:05] happen Co happen they put an
[41:08] extraordinary amount of money took us a
[41:10] 100 years to get this much money in the
[41:12] world and four years they doubled it
[41:14] like 100 to four and that's happening
[41:17] quicker and quicker and quicker and
[41:19] that's taken like a couple of years to
[41:21] play out people had savings and they
[41:23] they bought the media lies that
[41:25] inflation's transitory it's not going to
[41:26] hang around
[41:27] but now people are feeling the pain of
[41:30] it on an individual level companies are
[41:32] feeling the pain of it on a company
[41:34] level nation states are feeling the pain
[41:38] on a nation state level and they can see
[41:41] Bitcoin they've still got access to the
[41:42] money printer when the US does start
[41:45] buying and if they haven't already
[41:47] they're going to be
[41:48] like oh this is serious now like this is
[41:52] actually happening whether they believe
[41:54] in it or not not to have Bitcoin
[41:58] could be the worst decision like
[42:00] whatever happened with Germany I know
[42:01] they're forced to sell in stuff they
[42:03] should have become a little bit more
[42:04] creative and found whatever way they
[42:07] could to have held on to those 50,000
[42:09] Bitcoin but they didn't and it looks
[42:11] like Joe Biden's approved the sale of
[42:14] 10,000 coins yesterday or or whatever it
[42:17] is not everyone's realizing what Bitcoin
[42:20] is but when they actually see that the
[42:23] US starts buying it they may rethink
[42:26] that and even if they don't think about
[42:28] it very seriously and understand they'll
[42:30] just be monkey see monkey do and I think
[42:33] that's where we go absolutely insane
[42:35] that does not mean the super Cycles here
[42:38] that does not mean that we're not going
[42:39] to have a 50% 70% 80% draw down I
[42:42] believe the draw Downs are going to get
[42:44] smaller I still like I ex not even
[42:48] expect I hope for an 86% draw down Robin
[42:51] I fear we're never going to have one
[42:52] again I I hope for it but at least I'm
[42:55] aware that a potenti could happen and
[42:58] it's not going to shake me
[42:59] out but I think like we will get to a
[43:02] point where it just goes absolutely
[43:04] crazy and if we've got like retail's not
[43:08] really here yet we have seen the the
[43:11] Google search interest go up like a tiny
[43:13] little bit and it's come back down it's
[43:15] not until like it's really elevated that
[43:18] we're we're anywhere near the top of the
[43:19] market and we're pretty much at $100,000
[43:23] $95,000 um as of today 96,000 whatever
[43:26] it is
[43:28] but when we're at like 150 or 200,000
[43:30] and people like piling in piling in
[43:32] piling in nation states are just hitting
[43:34] the money print to whatever it is and
[43:36] they're just gobbling up and we shoot up
[43:38] say we went from 200,000 to 500,000 this
[43:40] cycle within 30 days and then some bad
[43:45] news comes out maybe the states is like
[43:47] realizing that it's getting away so they
[43:49] put out a fear or a fud campaign and
[43:52] then it
[43:53] crashes like like expects that but also
[43:58] on the other hand like be prepared for
[44:00] it but don't base everything on like
[44:04] what might happen or what could happen
[44:06] like what's in our control now like the
[44:09] best way for the most amount of people
[44:10] if you're new to bitcoin is just buy
[44:12] Bitcoin every day or every week or if
[44:14] it's once a month the same amount for
[44:16] four years and then after a fouryear
[44:19] period you're probably going to do it
[44:20] anyway CU you understand but if you only
[44:22] do it for 4E period hold it for four
[44:24] years like you're good your your life is
[44:26] sweet you sorted you've created
[44:28] generational wealth in that time but
[44:31] yeah there's two things I don't think
[44:33] we're going to
[44:34] go vertical from here to a million and
[44:37] then 10 million which is ultimately
[44:39] where we're going and probably past that
[44:41] which is 100x from here it's not just
[44:43] going to be straight up it's going to be
[44:45] like straight up and then down a little
[44:47] bit and then sideways like we had 58k
[44:49] gang for a while and then probably climb
[44:52] climb back up I I think I guess the the
[44:54] message that spit over the place is be
[44:56] prepared for everything um
[44:59] psychologically but also be prepared
[45:02] that none of those things happen and
[45:04] what's the best way for you to be able
[45:06] to get the most amount of Bitcoin as
[45:07] quick as possible and self cast you
[45:09] because that's all that matters the
[45:11] price does not matter the amount of
[45:13] Satoshi you have matters at the moment
[45:15] is
[45:16] 1,44 Satoshi per US dollar this morning
[45:23] so that would be a crazy moment when it
[45:25] drops under that font f
[45:29] it it's so crazy man it's and like even
[45:33] above 100K one bitcoin's one Bitcoin the
[45:37] Bitcoin itself the
[45:39] protocol it doesn't think it's not
[45:41] sentient it doesn't care if we're at
[45:43] $100,000 or $10,000 or $100 or whatever
[45:47] but humans we like to see these things
[45:49] and we're talking about oh 100k this
[45:51] cycle and maybe we could have got to
[45:53] 100K but China came in then FDX and 3ac
[45:56] and block fine that's another reason not
[45:58] to keep your Bitcoin on the exchange
[45:59] these exchanges go bust and they go bust
[46:01] in a bad way um you know it started off
[46:04] with Mount gogs it's happened since the
[46:06] start but
[46:08] um
[46:10] it's yeah it's an exciting time
[46:14] it's yeah when it when it gets under a
[46:16] th000 or where it gets over $100,000
[46:19] like under a th000 sets per USD or over
[46:23] 100,000 just because we're human and we
[46:25] like round numbers
[46:28] it will make the media when bitcoin's
[46:31] portrayed favorably in the media more
[46:33] people come in pushes the price higher
[46:35] and then as the price goes higher the
[46:37] media talks about it more favorably
[46:38] because it gets more clicks it brings
[46:40] more people in we go a little bit higher
[46:41] a little bit higher a little bit higher
[46:43] until I know someone like an Asian state
[46:45] says no I opt out or like um Tesla did
[46:50] Elon M said no we're stopping accepting
[46:53] Bitcoin straight down you know um and
[46:57] and and it can happen is um what is the
[47:00] ultimate importance of of the Bitcoin
[47:03] price obviously when we talk to actual
[47:05] bitcoiners who have been completely
[47:06] orange built uh they don't they don't
[47:10] care about the Bitcoin price but then at
[47:12] the flip side is like now now we're
[47:14] ripping with the Bitcoin price and my
[47:16] Twitter feed is just full with Bitcoin
[47:19] price signals and everything like that
[47:21] and they also see like when the Bitcoin
[47:23] price is in the thumbnail more people
[47:24] click on it um so just from the data it
[47:27] seems like even for bitcoiners the price
[47:30] still matters a lot uh because it's just
[47:33] like that Curiosity of of where it goes
[47:36] and we still uh have our US dollar Euros
[47:40] whatever your local fear currency is
[47:42] that unitive account in our head um what
[47:46] what what is the um would say that the
[47:49] importance of of the Bitcoin price I
[47:52] personally look at that a little bit as
[47:53] as a scoreboard of how bad the field
[47:56] currency is doing how do you look at
[47:58] that love that dude I I love that I
[48:01] absolutely love that um Ju Just on that
[48:04] point Bitcoin and Australia hit new
[48:07] all-time high three weeks I think before
[48:10] the US did because we had lost 12 and a
[48:12] half% over the last couple of years
[48:14] against the US dollar while the US
[48:17] dollar had lost 25% of purchasing power
[48:20] so that just goes to show how bad the
[48:23] Pacific piece the Australian dollar is
[48:25] here like I really really like that it's
[48:28] a scoreboard and how how bad fear it's
[48:30] doing the way that I see the Bitcoin
[48:34] price is a couple of things I think
[48:38] earlier in my journey watching the price
[48:41] once it got to a certain
[48:43] figure then I knew that I had my time
[48:46] back which was really cool then I could
[48:49] make my own choices and I didn't need a
[48:50] slave away at a 9
[48:52] to5 that for me was very empowering
[48:57] as it's gone past that number and when
[48:59] it dips and it's not dropping below that
[49:01] number for me the prices is really
[49:03] irrelevant as long as it stays above
[49:04] that number like it's good I'm good
[49:07] however what I love about the price now
[49:09] on this dayto day is it is the most
[49:12] effective marketing tool to get people
[49:15] to pay attention to bitcoin and as
[49:18] you're saying
[49:20] bitcoiners don't really think the price
[49:22] is important for themselves after a
[49:24] certain point of this the way I perceive
[49:26] it but as we hit these figures whether
[49:29] it's 69,000 which is a good meme number
[49:31] and it's old alltime high or we hit
[49:34] $100,000 which is something Bitcoin has
[49:37] been talking about for a while number
[49:38] one it brings in new people like it
[49:40] starts the conversation you can be like
[49:42] for the first time in history bitcoin's
[49:44] at $100,000 like like what the hell like
[49:47] that's that's crazy but it's also
[49:50] validating that all the research all the
[49:53] time the hundreds or the thousands of
[49:55] hours we' both thousands of hours into
[49:58] Bitcoin now you're like my thinking is
[50:00] sharp it's on point it's clear it's
[50:02] concise and what I thought about through
[50:05] putting in my own proof of work and
[50:07] looking at different models charts
[50:09] watching it and seeing he Fe it works
[50:13] understanding the central bank system
[50:15] which is inherently broken designed to
[50:17] control
[50:18] Slave disempower people when Bitcoin
[50:22] hits these figures you're like yes like
[50:24] I invalidated everything that I thought
[50:27] was right or was on the right path and
[50:30] that's what what I love about it is
[50:32] number one like it confirms that our
[50:34] thinking is right or wrong and number
[50:36] two is it brings new people in and when
[50:39] new people come in then we can dive into
[50:41] deeper conversations of Bitcoin is the
[50:45] separation of money from State it is a
[50:46] tool to be able to free humanity and not
[50:49] everyone in the world even needs to own
[50:51] Bitcoin for the world to get better for
[50:53] everyone it's just more people need to
[50:56] use it for for a store of value instead
[50:57] of using their house or real estate as a
[50:59] store of value that frees up more real
[51:01] estate for the people that don't care
[51:03] about Bitcoin um and that that's really
[51:06] what I I love is it just brings more
[51:08] attention to it and we're going to see
[51:10] like say say hypothetically we go to
[51:14] $500,000 some and then we crash some
[51:16] unlucky jok is going to buy
[51:18] $500,000 and they're going to say screw
[51:21] this it's a Ponzi scheme it's a scam and
[51:24] they're never going to come back and
[51:26] then a couple more years bitcoin's going
[51:28] to be at a million and then 10 million
[51:30] and they're going to be like n it's just
[51:31] going to crash and I'm going to buy it
[51:32] when it's at $300,000 or whatever and
[51:35] they never get back in but there'll be
[51:37] other people that see the price going up
[51:39] 100 two three four
[51:41] $500,000 and they buy it and they start
[51:45] reading and even if the the price
[51:47] crashes which what we did is we hung
[51:49] around for a full cycle through the bare
[51:51] Market put in the proof of work read the
[51:53] books those are the people that are
[51:55] really going to change the world they're
[51:57] the going of people that next cycle when
[52:00] Bitcoin starting a rally or before it is
[52:02] during the bare Market be like you need
[52:03] to get some of this you need to hold in
[52:05] self cust they're going to be the new
[52:06] Educators they're going to be the new
[52:08] people putting on company balance sheets
[52:11] on pension balance sheets incorporated
[52:14] into like super annuation or retirement
[52:16] or within government treasuries I I
[52:19] think the the pric
[52:22] is like it's incredible and like it's
[52:26] just [ __ ] man it's a lot of fun it like
[52:29] Bitcoin when it was at $58,000 forever
[52:31] like it felt like it went on forever but
[52:33] how cool was the 58k gang like just just
[52:36] the memes the engagement and brought it
[52:39] in and then once we went past that and
[52:42] then we hit 69,000 which sold alltime
[52:45] High people like oh like where where are
[52:48] these guys like bring them back and then
[52:49] we've got someone to be able to blame
[52:51] that they're no longer controlling the
[52:52] Bitcoin price but it just brings like a
[52:54] a level of
[52:58] um a joy into it because I guess when
[53:01] you go down into to bitcoin Bitcoin is
[53:05] that tool to free Humanity to be able to
[53:07] exit the system to be able to save
[53:09] yourself from
[53:10] inflation but to come to that
[53:12] realization you need to realize how
[53:14] distorted and dystopian and tyrannical
[53:17] the whole Fiat system is and that can
[53:21] get really depressive but when you've
[53:23] got these dopamine hits of Bitcoin going
[53:25] from 50 to 69 to $100,000 it can lift
[53:29] your spirit and then the whole Community
[53:31] comes in there and the media and stuff
[53:33] and then you become validated and you
[53:35] can say I told you s in a joking way or
[53:38] whatever but it it brings the excitement
[53:40] and makes it not so serious because
[53:43] anyone that truly understands really
[53:45] doesn't care that bitcoin's at 100,000
[53:47] they're probably not
[53:49] selling 100% And we are now at the the
[53:53] 95k gang I guess we we having a new gang
[53:56] now yeah I'm I'm surprised how stable is
[53:59] actually under 100K um and I think the
[54:02] 100K Mark will be a big one to hit it's
[54:05] it's it's it's a number where the
[54:07] mainstream news cycle will uh pick a
[54:10] bitcoin price up again it was the same
[54:12] in Austria when we hit the new alltime
[54:14] high they just reported on the price
[54:16] they didn't say anything about it except
[54:18] the price which was really frustrating
[54:21] uh that they didn't say anything except
[54:24] hey bitcoin price hit that uh and if you
[54:26] invested that amount of money in 2010 in
[54:29] Bitcoin now you would have that much
[54:31] money but if you invested from two it
[54:33] was so funny how they did it they they
[54:35] picked the top in 2021 and the bottom in
[54:39] 2022 and said if you invested in
[54:42] specifically that region you would have
[54:44] lost that much money in Bitcoin and I'm
[54:45] like yeah you really picked the time
[54:47] frame
[54:49] where where you have lost look at the
[54:51] chart that you're portraying any other
[54:54] time that is longer than the that year
[54:56] that is longer than like let's say as
[54:58] you said before four years you would
[55:00] have made money and a lot of it so it's
[55:03] it's interesting uh it will be
[55:04] interesting to see where uh the the
[55:07] Bitcoin memes will uh first of like the
[55:10] the the Bitcoin media the Bitcoin memes
[55:11] will erupt from the 100K I'm really
[55:14] curious what what kind of things we will
[55:17] come up with at the 100K and then the
[55:19] same time like how's the mainstream
[55:21] media reacting to 100K because we had it
[55:25] at $1 we had it at $10 we had at $100
[55:28] then th000 then 10,000 and now 100K uh
[55:32] but yeah I think the really crazy number
[55:34] that I'm actually looking forward is the
[55:35] 1 million because thing retail um will
[55:39] sleep through that 100K I don't know if
[55:42] I don't think they will wake up because
[55:44] of 100K uh there will be uh more people
[55:47] waking up but not the the masses I think
[55:50] the masses will wake up at at around a
[55:53] million or around where we probably hit
[55:55] the the go market cap where we actually
[55:57] go in a a really really big uh Market uh
[56:01] but yeah I hope they wake up earlier
[56:03] because I want retail I want the PLS
[56:06] owning Bitcoin and that not micro
[56:08] strategy black R and all the big
[56:10] institutions that's why we have to
[56:11] Orange P the blabs yeah M I'm 100% with
[56:15] it I you know I feel like your missions
[56:18] is the the same as mine as if we can get
[56:20] Bitcoin into the hands of the everyday
[56:22] person the world comes better with w
[56:26] Street for example yes it's not Black
[56:29] Rock owns the Bitcoin it's all these
[56:33] people which could just be plebs I'm
[56:35] sure most of them are high net worth
[56:36] individuals or in credited investors so
[56:40] there's a lot of people holding it but
[56:42] it's only one person holding the keys
[56:44] who has total control over it and that's
[56:47] I guess like where my mission comes from
[56:49] is it's only from yourself holding the
[56:51] keys and having like a network or a
[56:54] decentralized network of people holding
[56:56] the keys that can rise up say say like
[57:00] all the the the Black Rock investors or
[57:02] Wall Street investors or whatever they
[57:05] wanted to vote
[57:08] on to like push a politician or whatever
[57:13] favorably towards Bitcoin but through
[57:17] donations and Larry thinks like no you
[57:19] can't can't move your your Bitcoin well
[57:21] like then there's an entity in in the
[57:23] way and it really comes down to his
[57:25] thoughts of the regul or the law or
[57:27] whatever governs him um and stops the
[57:31] true world changing aspect or the new
[57:36] reality that we could bring in by just
[57:38] using Bitcoin as is intended to hold the
[57:42] keys 100% and one thing
[57:47] um it it came up yesterday actually in
[57:51] in podcast where I talked with Ken
[57:53] halberton from from SAS mining uh um uh
[57:57] where he said it was interesting to see
[57:59] that the Bitcoin mining cycle there's
[58:01] like a Bitcoin mining cycle and there's
[58:02] a bitcoin price cycle and he kind of saw
[58:05] the last cycle where Bitcoin mining
[58:08] cycle actually broke and the hash rate
[58:10] is kind just keep getting up even though
[58:12] the Bitcoin uh price was down uh and it
[58:16] was kind of the decoupling there and he
[58:19] said it might be like a precursor of uh
[58:22] the Bitcoin price maybe breaking and I
[58:25] know we said that in every Bull Run that
[58:27] we hit like a super cycle or like we're
[58:30] breaking the the the fouryear cycle
[58:32] thing I think most bitcoiners agreed
[58:35] that at some point that cycle will break
[58:37] at some point we will uh not have those
[58:40] three years up one year down three years
[58:43] up one year down um Cycles in Bitcoin uh
[58:47] but now with with Bitcoin mining maybe
[58:49] as a precursor with strategic Reserve
[58:51] with now institutions and so many
[58:53] companies in there so like retail is is
[58:56] getting kind of smaller in proportion
[58:59] and like big companies that just have
[59:01] like a 5 10 year outlook and probably
[59:03] are not trading around as much as as we'
[59:05] seen with micro strategy they just kept
[59:08] keep buying they will not sell they will
[59:09] not trade around with Bitcoin are we now
[59:12] actually might be at the point where the
[59:15] Cycle Theory might break oh I think
[59:18] going back to my earlier Point like it
[59:22] it could at any
[59:25] time but to base your savings decisions
[59:29] or investment decisions on something
[59:32] that we're not going to know until
[59:33] hindsight I don't know if that's the
[59:35] wisest thing someone can do I I believe
[59:39] the smartest strategy that's worked for
[59:42] the most amount of people is if you're
[59:45] just hearing about Bitcoin again not
[59:47] Financial advice but if you're just
[59:49] hearing about Bitcoin whatever you're
[59:51] willing to lose say it's $100 put in 110
[59:56] um because then you're like a little bit
[60:12] overinvestment in something or they're
[60:15] putting their hard-earned cash into
[60:17] something they're going to start paying
[60:18] attention they're going to understand
[60:19] that it's just something that you hold
[60:21] and you want to get as much from as
[60:22] forever I think if we start pushing out
[60:25] this Narrative of it's a super cycle
[60:29] that's going up forever and somebody
[60:31] comes in at 500,000 and it drops down to
[60:34] 300,000 well it hasn't gone up forever
[60:37] in that short amounts of time they just
[60:39] stopped out um that
[60:42] could be be detrimental to to them and
[60:46] like every person Robin that we lose
[60:48] along the way it's not just one person
[60:50] like it's their friends it's their
[60:51] family I don't know about you but for
[60:54] myself from studying Bitcoin like the
[60:56] more I know about it the more I want to
[60:58] share it or the more I do share it and
[61:00] I've noticed that with anyone that
[61:02] really understands Bitcoin is when they
[61:04] really understand it they will help as
[61:06] many other people understand Bitcoin and
[61:08] when those people understand Bitcoin
[61:09] they're going to help other people so if
[61:11] we're like losing people along the way
[61:14] that one person may be the best Network
[61:16] marketer in the world that person could
[61:18] be someone like Elon Musk or for example
[61:21] that has like a major audience and that
[61:23] ripple effect for positive change
[61:26] transformational change of the system of
[61:29] people's lives has failed
[61:33] because we're talking about something
[61:35] that we have no freaking idea whether
[61:36] it's going to happen or not maybe it
[61:38] will and at some stage all models are
[61:41] broken power law stock to flow is
[61:43] already broken Plan B says the stock to
[61:46] flow model is broken price chart going
[61:49] like
[61:50] this like everything will break but all
[61:54] of them are useful if you can like look
[61:55] at the the chart over time or the power
[61:59] over time or the stock to flow over time
[62:01] all of them go up and the right but if
[62:03] the message is it's never coming down
[62:05] again this a super cycle and then it
[62:07] does come down those people are going to
[62:09] be like these people are just [ __ ]
[62:11] clowns I'm out of here they're they're
[62:12] lying they're distorted because we're
[62:14] talking about something we have no idea
[62:16] about and I'm guilty of it in the past
[62:18] for sure I
[62:20] think the way that I'm trying to come
[62:22] across is be like over time when you
[62:26] zoom out Bitcoin will go up literally
[62:27] for the rest of our lives forever
[62:29] because they're going to print money
[62:31] forever however along the way it's going
[62:33] to be bumpy as just expect that and hope
[62:36] for because you get more satosi if
[62:37] you're DCA and buying dollar cost
[62:39] averaging every week or month or
[62:42] whatever 100% I I agree with that that's
[62:45] really great um it's I just want to um
[62:49] because I get that sometimes actually in
[62:51] the comment is a question of like oh is
[62:53] it a good strategy to to get out of some
[62:56] Bitcoin once we at the top then I'm
[62:58] always asking okay how do you know it's
[62:59] the top first of all and how do you know
[63:02] that the cycle are not breaking so uh
[63:04] don't try to predict uh anything in the
[63:06] Bitcoin price because you you can't we
[63:08] we we might like we might break the the
[63:11] Bitcoin cycles and we're going up four
[63:13] years but maybe the fifth year is then
[63:15] the down year you you don't know we we
[63:18] all don't know what the Bitcoin price is
[63:20] doing in the short term we just know
[63:22] directionally where where it's headed
[63:24] and I think that's that's the best thing
[63:26] to do and definitely with orange ping
[63:29] people um make them aware of that's a
[63:32] longterm play uh if if you need that
[63:35] money uh in in five months um maybe it's
[63:40] a good idea to have something in in a in
[63:43] a in a more shortterm investment like a
[63:46] US dollar or like something else where
[63:48] you can get it out uh like treat Bitcoin
[63:51] as something that you really have in
[63:52] there for the long run that's your
[63:54] savings account that's not your uh um
[63:57] like checking account right now because
[64:00] it's so volatile if you do um have that
[64:03] as I do I actually have in my savings
[64:05] and my checking account as I'm just 100%
[64:08] in Bitcoin but that strategy uh is is
[64:11] probably not for most people um but uh
[64:15] it's it's it's something where you want
[64:17] to go if you want to do that uh it's
[64:19] it's it's a lot of fun but it also comes
[64:21] with some disadvantages uh I choose to
[64:24] do the 100% strategy
[64:26] um but it's not something you want to
[64:29] tell people that just come in like they
[64:32] would be overwhelmed with that just like
[64:36] let them come slow I needed three years
[64:39] to go over Bitcoin is a scam and then I
[64:43] needed over one year to go from Bitcoin
[64:46] might be something to bitcoin is really
[64:49] great and I'm going all in so it it just
[64:52] takes time and be patient and it it can
[64:54] be hard
[64:56] because especially when you're that
[64:58] bitcoiner that knows what's going on
[65:00] with the Fiat system and then you know
[65:02] what's going on with Bitcoin uh you
[65:04] really want to grab people and and get
[65:07] them in as fast as possible but you have
[65:09] to be patient you have to be loving and
[65:11] caring to them and have the empathy to
[65:13] know it's it's not going to happen
[65:15] tomorrow they're not going to be a full
[65:17] bitcoiner tomorrow if they're now
[65:19] completely in feared uh it's a journey
[65:22] as as it was with all of
[65:24] us yeah it is um absolutely it's an
[65:28] incredible journey and and nobody should
[65:32] um I think stop trying to help other
[65:35] people understand but like you're saying
[65:37] definitely have the
[65:39] empathy bitcoin's not a five minute
[65:42] conversation it's not something that you
[65:43] can get overnight so just be be be kind
[65:46] and courteous like I I dare say Robin to
[65:50] get to that point where you're living on
[65:51] a Bitcoin
[65:53] standard like you had to put in thousand
[65:55] thousands of hours of research to
[66:00] understand it and then probably a couple
[66:02] of thousand hours more before you
[66:03] implemented it and there's time to be
[66:05] able to ponder and see if other people
[66:07] are doing it as well so it's not going
[66:10] to happen overnight and also don't think
[66:12] it has to happen at all like especially
[66:16] if you've got fixed costs so for like
[66:18] personally we've got cash for the next
[66:19] six months for our personal for our
[66:21] business we got about two two and a half
[66:23] years and then we don't need to worry
[66:25] about the volatility of Bitcoin or
[66:28] whatever and then everything else just
[66:29] goes into Bitcoin so like for the next
[66:33] period of time like we're good and we'll
[66:35] always just make sure we have that sixth
[66:36] month capacity As Time rolls on then
[66:39] everything else can go into Bitcoin and
[66:40] that's like allowing it just to be
[66:43] savings
[66:44] for like one day or never or whenever
[66:49] but it doesn't be like I need Bitcoin to
[66:52] do a 200x over the next 12 months
[66:55] otherwise them absolutely stuff like
[66:56] that's
[66:57] the we're going to lose people and like
[67:01] lose
[67:02] people a lot of people Robin with died
[67:06] of suicide due to financial
[67:09] stress like we don't need to push people
[67:13] in that direction people don't need to
[67:16] put themselves in that position there
[67:18] are ways to be able to approach your
[67:21] finances very systematically and look
[67:25] people like Bitcoin so risky it's
[67:27] actually not it's volatile volatility
[67:31] does not mean risk so like what
[67:32] strategies can we play is that having
[67:35] six months or two two and a half years
[67:36] of cash on the balance sheets to be able
[67:38] to write out that volatility and you're
[67:39] not worried about
[67:41] it 100% And and we're already over one
[67:45] hour I was so quick with you I'm really
[67:48] loving your conversations um one topic
[67:52] that I saw from you that has nothing to
[67:54] do or maybe a little bit to do with
[67:56] Bitcoin that I want to get into is you
[67:58] tried carnivore as a diet I think 30
[68:01] days uh and I'm just really curious
[68:03] because it seems to be like really
[68:05] connected with the Bitcoin Community the
[68:07] the carnival Community even though diet
[68:10] has no direct uh um link to to food but
[68:14] there are some some really interesting
[68:17] uh conversations around that and I had
[68:18] the offer of Matthew on from from Fiat
[68:22] food who worked with sioning on the bat
[68:26] uh what is your experience with
[68:29] carnivore how how was that 30 days are
[68:31] you still going uh what is kind of your
[68:34] experience there yeah um let's frame
[68:39] like how I hear about it was through the
[68:42] the Bitcoin
[68:43] community and some people would think
[68:46] that health and wealth uh not connected
[68:51] but what's the point of accumulating
[68:52] wealth if you're going to lose your
[68:54] health in the process like the three
[68:56] most important things to me Robin is
[68:58] health wealth and relationships and
[69:00] relationships first then health and then
[69:03] like wealth is the the very last and the
[69:06] wealth can be a tool to get more or have
[69:09] more like more time or better health or
[69:11] better relationships so I think they're
[69:14] like very connected and I think
[69:15] everything is Downstream of money but
[69:18] the carnivore diet so that was
[69:22] probably two and a half three months ago
[69:24] that I did about 30 days out of the 30
[69:27] days so say 4 weeks 2 weeks were
[69:30] freaking brutal man um I drank like 20
[69:34] to not anymore but I was drinking like
[69:36] 20 to 30 Cups of Tea per day with two
[69:38] tea bags in the meech when I went onto
[69:41] the carnival diet which was literally
[69:42] just steak and eggs and then water with
[69:46] electrolytes and salt or salt I cut out
[69:50] all coffee so like day one I woke up I
[69:54] made a sorry tea out of habit I drank
[69:57] the first cup of tea I went to grab the
[69:59] second one I'm like oh I'm not meant to
[70:01] be drinking this I like just thrw it out
[70:03] over the lawn next day massive caffeine
[70:07] withdrawals like it it was absolutely
[70:09] hectic feels like someone got a baseball
[70:11] bat and like smashed me in the blood
[70:13] brain barrier it was just crazy um and
[70:17] then after that it was good for a couple
[70:18] of days um maybe for about a a week
[70:23] probably a little bit low in energy at
[70:26] the start and then 2 weeks in went
[70:29] traveling got their keto flu for for 6
[70:33] days and that was that was tough man I
[70:36] don't feel like I've ever been as sick
[70:38] in my entire life as fallen asleep
[70:40] during the middle of the day I couldn't
[70:42] concentrate I had no energy I was so
[70:45] lethargic um I just felt like that real
[70:47] sickly sweat um I think like the last
[70:51] time I ever felt that when I was a kid I
[70:53] don't know like have you ever been so
[70:55] sick you just feel like sticky and
[70:58] disgusting um so then that went on but
[71:02] then on day six when it stopped the day
[71:05] after like felt okay the next two days
[71:09] after that I've never felt so good
[71:11] internally in my entire life man like I
[71:13] was just running on all cylinders like a
[71:16] V8 supercharged nitrous and juicing
[71:19] super car man I was just like going to
[71:22] the Moon I was just so positive so
[71:24] euphoric when going to the gym the
[71:26] amount of energy the amount of
[71:29] stamina the couple of like really
[71:31] amazing things happen so I've got these
[71:33] restless legs and I've had restless legs
[71:35] for for like many many many years I take
[71:38] this pharmaceutical medication which is
[71:41] called par paralin I can't even
[71:44] pronounce it like it it's just it's so
[71:46] bad and it's got a list of side effects
[71:47] of like this long like written in like
[71:49] the world's smallest writing that you
[71:52] need a magnifying glass to be able to
[71:53] see but I managed to to cut down to half
[71:57] the amount over like just two weeks into
[71:59] the thing and I've been able to cut down
[72:01] even more since but did that like
[72:03] restless legs stopped stamina went up
[72:06] energy went up and due due to those
[72:09] pills of and knocking my brain around at
[72:13] a really young age like like smacking my
[72:15] head um sort of getting a bit of a brain
[72:18] injury there and then from partaking and
[72:21] listed substances and stuff I really
[72:23] fried my brain I knew this I used to be
[72:27] very intelligent as a kid very sharp uh
[72:29] very clear and quick with my reflexes
[72:32] and responses verbally and then from all
[72:35] that abuse that my body went through and
[72:37] then the pharmaceutical medication on
[72:40] top like a really noticed an issue with
[72:42] my memory recall and like just how quick
[72:45] I could pull things out of my own brain
[72:48] and and then push him back out there
[72:51] that really has changed and it's
[72:53] continued to improve um since
[72:55] like absolutely amazing I don't know if
[72:57] the carnival diets for everyone I I
[73:01] don't know CU I'm not everyone
[73:03] but I didn't just decide to do it like
[73:07] I've always trying to be improveed
[73:09] myself but about five years ago I tried
[73:13] uh I was like first doing like the
[73:14] vegetarian diet and then I went like
[73:17] hardcore strict vegan and I've never
[73:20] been so sick in my life um I've never
[73:23] had like the least amount of energy that
[73:25] diet was absolutely terrible for me but
[73:28] then like I believe the world's
[73:30] strongest lady is uh a vegan you know so
[73:34] it like really works for for some people
[73:36] and at one stage the World's Strongest
[73:37] Man was a vegan but for me not to think
[73:41] about food like food for me is just fuel
[73:45] I found the carnival diet the the meat
[73:48] steak and eggs so good so I did it for
[73:50] 30 days when I went off day 31 I ate
[73:54] sweet potato and I can't remember else
[73:57] what I had but it was so bad it felt
[74:01] like sandpaper within my intestines and
[74:03] my garden is just absolutely horrible
[74:05] and I haven't had sweet potatoes since
[74:07] but since then I have tried a couple of
[74:09] things so I only eat two meals a day
[74:11] lunch and dinner so that's 14 meals a
[74:14] week 12 of my meals a week a steak or
[74:17] steak and egg um the today at lunch I
[74:20] had three bits of steak two eggs
[74:22] yesterday I had I don't know six pieces
[74:24] of steak all up
[74:25] eggs but then there will be times those
[74:29] those two other meals where I'll just
[74:31] try other things my wife makes this
[74:34] amazing red sauce pasta I like macaroni
[74:37] I don't think macaroni is good for you I
[74:39] don't give a [ __ ] like my my wife makes
[74:42] the most amazing red sauce Italian pasta
[74:45] it's incredible to have that you know
[74:48] every now and then scra then like
[74:50] whatever other meal like the other night
[74:52] we had chicken nibbles has really really
[74:55] lovely and even if I don't feel optimal
[74:57] because I know those things aren't
[74:58] optimal for me for it only to be two
[75:02] meals like space out through the week
[75:03] and the rest of them are absolutely
[75:05] amazing man it's incredible it's the
[75:08] best thing I I've ever ever done and
[75:11] sort of like the the authority figure on
[75:13] the Carnival diet is Dr sha
[75:16] Baker he's a bitcoiner as well you you
[75:20] know and he he wrote the book uh the the
[75:23] carnivore diet I I did a podcast with
[75:26] him as well and I lined the podcast up
[75:29] so I'd have him on the day that I
[75:30] started doing the diet because I wanted
[75:32] to talk to the world's expert in regards
[75:34] to it he ended up um having like a video
[75:37] shoot and stuff so I couldn't make it
[75:38] till two days after but by that time I
[75:40] was suffering from the caffeine
[75:42] withdrawals so I could really like dive
[75:44] in and find out what was going on but I
[75:47] I guess the messaging there is for me is
[75:50] really amazing it worked really really
[75:52] really
[75:53] incredible but I did seek out side
[75:55] information I read the the carnival diet
[75:57] the carnival code like so many reviews
[76:00] so many people online was jumping on to
[76:02] X and into the carnival community and
[76:04] then watching endless YouTube videos
[76:07] before I went in there so I knew what to
[76:08] expect um because people like oh if you
[76:11] don't have any fiber you're going to get
[76:13] constipated exact opposite um you know
[76:17] for for a little while um and then like
[76:22] just like to know all that was coming
[76:25] and then to be able to go through and
[76:26] realize that it's going to get like
[76:28] really hard and not give up at that
[76:30] moment to keep putting in the proof of
[76:32] work trus in the process and to feel the
[76:34] best I've ever been and then bro I get
[76:37] to eat steak or steak and eggs every day
[76:39] if I feel like it like man that's that's
[76:43] winning um in my view
[76:48] it's I would recommend that people
[76:51] research it and test it out it's not
[76:54] easy for me I found 100%
[76:58] worthwhile I love that a lot the
[77:00] messaging and there's also um it's I
[77:04] think that is the most confusing topic
[77:07] for me uh I mean there are some some
[77:09] things that is just through for like
[77:11] avoid processed food avoid sugar uh
[77:14] avoid eating uh right before sleep
[77:17] because it messes up your sleep at least
[77:19] for me uh get to the freshest food
[77:22] possible eat Whole Foods things where
[77:25] the ingredients list is just like more
[77:29] really
[77:30] long so there are some some common sense
[77:33] things that I think everyone agrees on
[77:37] but then there's like a really huge uh
[77:39] plan-based Community there's a carnival
[77:42] Community there are so many different
[77:44] communities between that um and it's
[77:47] just like I think a really confusing
[77:50] space uh to be honest and I think people
[77:52] should just try out what works and and I
[77:55] love how you did it you you went vegan
[77:57] you went vegetarian you went carnivore
[77:59] and you just tried
[78:01] out I tried all of them and Carnival
[78:04] just seemed to be the last one I don't
[78:07] know what other diets are out there like
[78:10] I've tried everything I could think of
[78:12] Mediterranean paleo keto Carnival vegan
[78:16] vegetarian
[78:18] pescatarian and then I just it just
[78:20] works for me um but yeah it's the same
[78:23] deal man like it may not work for
[78:25] everyone it doesn't need to work for
[78:26] everyone but just because one diet
[78:29] doesn't work doesn't mean another one
[78:32] won't work but I also think like sorry
[78:36] to like sort of cut in but it is very
[78:39] confusing and especially if you're
[78:42] already not in the most Optimal Health
[78:45] and your body's not talking to your
[78:47] brain and you you don't have the
[78:48] awareness of how your body's feeling and
[78:51] what good health feels like you may be
[78:54] getting mixed messages going on so it's
[78:56] sort of it's not just about eating right
[78:58] like that'll fix most problems but it's
[79:01] about going to the gym or you don't even
[79:03] need to go to the gym but doing like
[79:04] active exercise and moving and coming
[79:08] back into your body and inhabiting
[79:09] yourself and sorting out like your daily
[79:12] routine so so I only eat between um
[79:15] 11:30 and 4:30 usually it's 5:07 now so
[79:19] I'm going to have dinner later usually
[79:21] I'll be finished dinner by 5:00 sort of
[79:24] at at the latest it'll occasionally push
[79:27] out but like 95% of the time it's
[79:30] between 11:30 and 5: that I've had all
[79:32] my meals so that's 18 hours of the day
[79:35] that I'm fasting we don't go to sleep
[79:37] most people don't go to sleep the
[79:39] science the research shows that we need
[79:41] time for our body to to decompress to to
[79:46] be able to work through it and to be
[79:48] able to cool down like we also shouldn't
[79:50] exercise in in the evening it's better
[79:52] to exercise in the morning
[79:55] whereas if you exercise just before bed
[79:58] like your blood's really flowing and
[80:00] your body is like ready to go like
[80:02] you're ready to fight you're ready to
[80:03] party you're ready to get moving because
[80:05] that's what you've been doing and so
[80:08] like bringing like different things in
[80:10] and they may not work for everyone maybe
[80:11] it works better for someone but I also
[80:13] try to go to bed really early at like
[80:16] 7:37 and at 7:37 because the the robot
[80:19] vacuum comes out at 7:37 so we're always
[80:21] trying to beat the robot to bed so it
[80:23] can clean the house
[80:25] but go there and I'll read for like an
[80:27] hour and a half till 9:00 I'll take the
[80:29] dogs out I'll tie to the house for for
[80:32] 10 minutes just like slowly put things
[80:34] back in order the cushions and stuff and
[80:36] that just allows me to like slowly like
[80:39] bring my brain waves down I've been
[80:41] reading and it's just sort of like okay
[80:44] the next day is ready to go and then
[80:47] from there I wake up very early and like
[80:48] the second that I wake up walk down the
[80:51] hallway I open the door so the dogs can
[80:52] go on toilet I do 50 push-ups straight
[80:54] away within about 30 to to 60 seconds of
[80:58] waking to be able to start that then I
[81:01] go outside and then I like look into the
[81:03] sun straight away and then I'll come in
[81:05] here and then I'll get ready for my
[81:06] video or a podcast or the news or
[81:08] whatever it is then I'll go to the gym
[81:10] and then I'll grab my laptop and I live
[81:12] here in Queensland Central Queensland
[81:14] which is like hot hot hot as Hades it is
[81:19] so hot and it's like going into summer
[81:22] and I will just spend four to six hours
[81:24] every day in the sun sh it off and don't
[81:28] get sunburnt or whatever and just like
[81:30] really soaking that up and if I miss the
[81:34] sun like for a couple of days or
[81:35] something I don't sleep as well at night
[81:37] I don't feel optimal and not saying like
[81:40] everyone should do that but I've spent
[81:42] like years and years and years and years
[81:43] trying to like optimize my daily routine
[81:46] and it sounds freaking boring waking up
[81:48] at the same time going to bed at the
[81:50] same time eating within this narrow
[81:51] window making sure I get enough sleep
[81:53] getting enough Sun making sure that I'm
[81:55] tidying the house to be able to tidy my
[81:57] mind making sure all the dishes are put
[81:59] away or even the dishwashers stacked in
[82:01] a very particular way so it's all neat
[82:03] and that everything is neat and focused
[82:06] and on purpose that allows us well like
[82:10] even the clothes like every six months
[82:12] I'll go out and I'll buy like five new
[82:14] shirts and then I'll just wear those
[82:16] five new shirts for the next couple of
[82:17] days and on the weekend I'll grab
[82:19] whatever but I don't need to think about
[82:21] what shirt I'm grabbing it's on the
[82:23] clothes hanger and it's just the next
[82:24] one in line and then I'll L them on the
[82:26] Sunday and then I'll put them whatever
[82:28] order and that will be the order of the
[82:30] sht I wear but I don't need to think
[82:32] about it like they they're just there
[82:34] and so I think when it comes to like
[82:37] wealth accumulation or health biohacking
[82:42] or building your relationships it's what
[82:45] distractions can we remove out of our
[82:47] life so that we can focus and we can
[82:49] provide more value to society the more
[82:52] value we can provide to society the more
[82:54] money or fat currency they they are very
[82:57] different but we're going to be
[82:59] compensated for that the more we're
[83:01] compensated for that the more Bitcoin we
[83:02] buy the more Bitcoin we buy the more
[83:04] time that we're going to have in the
[83:05] future or the more capacity that we'll
[83:08] have in the future to be able to do
[83:10] bigger and better and grander things or
[83:12] we may not want to do it but then we've
[83:14] just got the time so the wife doesn't
[83:16] need to work a second job you're both
[83:17] working at home you're looking after the
[83:19] kids you're playing with the kids now
[83:21] your grandkids are growing up they don't
[83:24] need to go do a [ __ ] job they can go
[83:27] down into an area of study you can pay
[83:29] for their college tuition or whatever
[83:31] and something that they really want to
[83:33] do that's going to make impact like why
[83:35] wouldn't you try optimize everything to
[83:38] make it as simple to be able to provide
[83:40] the most amount of value to humanity
[83:42] that you possibly can so Humanity gets
[83:45] better quicker because we got a tool to
[83:47] do that now and the whole game is get as
[83:50] much put it in self- custody rinse
[83:52] repeat optimize to be able to get more
[83:54] and Bitcoin every four years gets more
[83:56] and more expensive so if you're not
[83:57] spending the next four years like
[83:59] tweaking and optimizing I think you're
[84:02] [ __ ] like that's my belief maybe
[84:04] people are right and that's the story I
[84:06] tell myself and I knew that I needed to
[84:07] sort my own [ __ ] out as I said I smashed
[84:10] my head around with addictions when I
[84:12] was younger I [ __ ] around and I found
[84:14] out and I thought somebody else was
[84:16] going to save me and poor me and all
[84:20] this [ __ ] that's not reality bro
[84:22] nobody's going to save anyone the only
[84:25] person that cares about as much as
[84:26] ourselves as ourselves and unless you
[84:28] take good care of yourself your
[84:30] partner's not even going to give a [ __ ]
[84:31] about you if you turn in this big fat
[84:33] lazy slob that winges [ __ ] complains
[84:36] doesn't put in the proof work doesn't
[84:38] show up and doesn't provide value to
[84:41] society who gives a [ __ ] about you and
[84:44] why even give a [ __ ] about yourself and
[84:47] that's that's sad there's so many people
[84:48] in the Fiat system it promotes that it
[84:51] pushes people into it like and I want no
[84:53] more of it so like anyone paying
[84:55] attention to bitcoin an hour and a half
[84:57] into the podcast thank you like thank
[84:59] you so much for putting in the proof
[85:01] work being willing it's not an easy
[85:03] conversation and is this about money no
[85:07] like money is really [ __ ] irrelevant
[85:09] everything that we do is for more more
[85:12] like better relationships and better
[85:14] health and the only reason we want
[85:15] better health is so we can have a better
[85:17] experience of here in reality like Earth
[85:20] is [ __ ] amazing for me God I believe
[85:23] in God but I believe in God and acronym
[85:25] The Great Outdoors nature it's amazing I
[85:28] I live on the Great Barrier I don't live
[85:30] on the Great Barrier Reef but like we
[85:32] look out at the Great barer Reef it's
[85:34] like finding Nema under there and like
[85:36] we'll go to the rainforest and it's just
[85:38] it's like this amazing Kaleidoscope or
[85:41] when I go flying and you're like around
[85:42] the clouds or whatever it is it's this
[85:44] just this giant
[85:46] playground and when we can remove
[85:49] ourselves from that fear system that
[85:50] keeps us so like depressed and
[85:53] suppressed we can really enjoy it and
[85:57] God has provided that to us and then I
[85:59] can go play with God like in The Great
[86:01] Outdoors like I don't know that's that
[86:04] that that's the point it's [ __ ]
[86:05] amazing I want everyone to experience it
[86:08] I think you do
[86:09] too uh I love that section uh that
[86:13] because it's it's so great to have the
[86:16] outside Financial topics into the
[86:19] podcast and that's why I love having a
[86:20] Bitcoin podcast because it allows me to
[86:23] talk about everything else too because
[86:25] bitcoiners are actually interested in
[86:27] that stuff and they they really like to
[86:29] hear that so thank you so much for for
[86:31] sharing that with us um we have end in
[86:33] the podcast uh of two questions one
[86:35] question is uh always the same question
[86:38] what can we learn from you outside of
[86:41] Bitcoin life is
[86:43] short we are all going to suffer very
[86:48] hard very difficult times at some stage
[86:52] in our life your mental Health your
[86:55] health your
[86:58] relationships they're not a nice to have
[87:01] I think like you really need to improve
[87:03] yourself and personal development is
[87:04] called personal because it is personal
[87:07] but don't shy away from your dark side
[87:10] don't miss having those card
[87:12] conversations with yourself with the
[87:14] loved one if for example like your
[87:16] wife's Kicking and Screaming that you're
[87:19] not listening to it and you keep saying
[87:21] you are you may think you are but not in
[87:23] the way that your wife needs you to show
[87:25] up or whatever like be willing to be
[87:27] able to self-respect reflect and respect
[87:30] yourself and work hard and push hard to
[87:33] be the best version of yourself possible
[87:35] because when that dark day comes when
[87:37] that black dog arrives unless you've got
[87:39] a good Network or tools and place to be
[87:42] able to ride through that it could end
[87:46] really bad it could be game game over
[87:50] and if it's game over and you take
[87:52] yourself out you never give yourself an
[87:54] opportunity to make life get better I've
[87:57] been in that situation been in that
[87:59] situation many times in my life and
[88:03] there's just this one thing inside me
[88:05] that just said no like you can do it you
[88:07] have to do it and sometimes there's
[88:09] things outside myself sometimes there's
[88:11] a voice inside myself but then pulling
[88:15] out through those dark places and like
[88:17] really going that self-development and
[88:18] trying to be the best that I can and
[88:20] understand what was going on in my own
[88:23] mind the traumatic experiences that
[88:25] happened in as a kid that like really
[88:28] [ __ ] me up and to be able to face
[88:29] those and work through those everything
[88:33] I've ever wanted has shown up on the
[88:35] other side of that because there's no
[88:38] maybe there are still distortions but
[88:40] every time I identify a distortion I'm
[88:41] willing to look at it go into it and
[88:43] it's only I think when we remove that
[88:47] Veil can we really go into the next
[88:49] level of Consciousness and the higher
[88:51] the level of Consciousness is like again
[88:54] we're we're compensated for the value we
[88:56] provide to the world if you're providing
[88:58] value like at a really high
[89:00] Consciousness and then you're saving
[89:01] that in Bitcoin or whatever like it just
[89:03] multiplies more and more and more I
[89:06] guess for me like be the change that you
[89:08] want to be in the world but if you're
[89:10] having a hard time like reach out to
[89:12] someone there there's support networks
[89:14] out there like live experience peer work
[89:16] for example talk to a peer work or
[89:18] somebody else that's been through
[89:20] something similar not to be able to tell
[89:22] you how to fix it but just be like I
[89:25] know bro like yes like [ __ ] I remember
[89:29] when I went through that and it was
[89:30] [ __ ] [ __ ] but you can see that
[89:32] they've gone through and it gives you a
[89:33] little bit of Hope because
[89:35] it's if it's bad like it's not the end
[89:39] and I guess I just keep telling myself
[89:41] it'll always get better like what else
[89:43] is possible and how's it getting better
[89:44] because it may not get better straight
[89:46] away but if you never give up I promise
[89:49] you it will if you never give up at
[89:51] least that was my experience and I I I
[89:53] hope
[89:55] um people can gain something from that
[89:58] 100% the they will really cool um I love
[90:02] that end routine we have where the
[90:04] previous guest is asking a question for
[90:05] the next guest without knowing who the
[90:07] next guest actually is and uh your
[90:09] question from the previous guest
[90:11] is uh I I wonder why why it never
[90:15] actually came that the question because
[90:17] it's a really interesting one what is
[90:18] the one question you wish people would
[90:21] ask you more what is the one question
[90:25] um am I too late to bitcoin I love that
[90:29] uh that's uh do do you get that a lot uh
[90:33] is is that something uh you still get a
[90:35] lot or is that uh no I I get a statement
[90:40] I'm too late to bitcoin but not the
[90:42] question if someone's asking a question
[90:44] they're curious and I I believe it's a
[90:47] question
[90:48] that I wish people would ask me more
[90:50] because you're never too late to bitcoin
[90:52] ever but you need to be to zoom out
[90:56] absolutely very very interesting perfect
[90:58] then thank you so much Sean for being on
[91:00] before I let you go where can people
[91:01] find you ask your questions and and
[91:03] watch your stuff yeah get a Bitcoin on
[91:06] YouTube g d a y Bitcoin b t c i n and
[91:11] the reason it's called g a Bitcoin is g
[91:13] a in Australia means good day I think
[91:15] it's always a good day to be paying
[91:17] attention to aligning ourselves with
[91:18] Bitcoin it's just a network based on
[91:20] truth and there there's set rules and
[91:23] there's no R so it's get a Bitcoin onx
