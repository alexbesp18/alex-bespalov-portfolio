[00:00] have you considered how the ETFs might
[00:03] uh fail as a financial instrument if a
[00:05] ETF corrupts Bitcoin then biton was
[00:08] never the sound money that we thought it
[00:10] is early on when I was in school I
[00:13] discovered a writing as the only real
[00:16] opportunity for me to express myself
[00:19] when I was a young kid my speech was
[00:21] horrendous and I had a a really hard
[00:23] time communicating anything with with
[00:25] anybody I feel honestly a privileged
[00:28] like to be able to express myself so
[00:31] coherently and so fully on these YouTube
[00:34] videos Cost of Freedom is like danger
[00:37] and it's the the constant threat of at a
[00:41] very basic level your life is at stake
[00:44] if you're living alone in the woods
[00:46] somewhere and you rely on nobody and
[00:49] nobody can control you you have to feed
[00:52] yourself there are no grocery stores for
[00:54] you to do anything if you do not kill an
[00:56] animal or a forge a food somehow you die
[01:00] real freedom is to just be a present and
[01:02] to be at one with what with that's
[01:06] happening around you I love dick horn I
[01:08] wear this hat every day in hopes that
[01:10] somebody sees it and asks me about it
[01:12] and I'm afraid of the ETF more than
[01:15] anything
[01:16] [Music]
[01:19] else um you wrote me a really nice
[01:23] comments on my uh podcast and you're the
[01:26] first one that I brought now on the
[01:29] podcast just from the YouTube comments I
[01:31] brought on a lot of people from Twitter
[01:33] comments that I get uh but now actually
[01:36] also someone from from my YouTube
[01:37] comments because you give like
[01:39] insightful like such comments like
[01:42] usually my comments are like two three
[01:43] sentences maybe and you're like giving
[01:45] that and I really enjoyed always uh
[01:48] reading them and I was like hey if you
[01:50] want to do a podcast uh let's come on
[01:52] and then I ask you and and you agreed on
[01:54] that and I'm I'm I'm loving that I can
[01:57] even give subscribers that are
[01:59] commenting on my podcast stage and and
[02:02] and interact with them so welcome to the
[02:05] podcast and and I'm I'm happy to to host
[02:08] you here thank you very much I
[02:11] appreciate it uh for sure um you know
[02:14] I'm a little bit older and uh when uh
[02:17] YouTube first uh started there were a
[02:21] long comments everywhere everybody just
[02:23] wanted to be heard and everybody wanted
[02:26] to express themselves and their opinions
[02:28] on things so
[02:30] it was not un a common at all I to see
[02:34] really
[02:35] long uh a comments and like really long
[02:39] conversations too that would go on and
[02:41] on for a few days
[02:44] sometimes that was happen stance uh you
[02:46] know 15 years ago uh a 10 years ago and
[02:50] and uh I think that the the uh
[02:53] technology of uh today has uh rendered
[02:57] people less uh interested
[03:00] in a long form of writing and everything
[03:04] is all about like
[03:06] short aivy uh Reddit style uh comments
[03:11] or a Twitter style where you just sort
[03:14] of like hop in there and Jab somebody
[03:17] and then hop out you know I think that a
[03:21] writing is an opportunity for us to not
[03:25] only explain ourselves and uh like
[03:28] elaborate more more deeply than we can
[03:32] through a verbally but it's also an
[03:35] opportunity for us to understand our own
[03:38] thoughts more because as you write
[03:41] something you have to you have to
[03:44] explore your own understanding of it in
[03:48] order to really communicate it
[03:51] appropriately and as you write something
[03:54] it's a a proof and as you get into it
[03:59] it's easy to see wait a minute I'm full
[04:02] of [ __ ] or wait a minute I don't
[04:05] understand this completely or you know
[04:07] that doesn't make any sense when you're
[04:10] speaking it's a lot easier to uh fool
[04:13] yourself into uh believing like you know
[04:15] what you're talking about and so I've
[04:19] always I've would have preferred uh
[04:22] writing but that you know that initially
[04:26] came from the idea that like I grew up
[04:28] with a speech a disorder that is you
[04:31] know obvious for anybody listening right
[04:34] now and um every time
[04:37] I communicate with somebody
[04:39] new I always like to advertise um and
[04:43] explain like I have a speech disorder I
[04:46] make a funny faces sometimes sometimes I
[04:49] get held up on a word or two um there's
[04:53] a lot of a mouth movements that you're
[04:55] not going to see with other people um
[04:58] and like I had that my whole life it
[05:01] comes from our childhood our trauma and
[05:04] that sort of thing so early on when I
[05:08] was in school I you know I discovered a
[05:13] writing as the only real opportunity for
[05:17] me to express myself um when I was when
[05:21] I was a young kid it was uh my speech
[05:26] was horrendous and I had a a really hard
[05:29] time
[05:30] communicating anything with with anybody
[05:32] I didn't have a lot of friends growing
[05:34] up and I was sort of in my own up bubble
[05:38] and so I I read a lot of books and I I
[05:41] wrote a lot and that was how I I was
[05:45] able to clarify my thoughts and express
[05:49] myself and all that
[05:51] so when I leave a YouTube comment it's
[05:55] after years and years of of uh feeling
[05:58] like a writing was the only way for me
[06:01] to express myself and so I feel now um I
[06:06] feel honestly a privileged like to be
[06:10] able to express myself so coherently and
[06:15] so fully on these YouTube videos you
[06:19] know or or or in any sort of a format
[06:22] because I I remember a time when
[06:27] expressing myself was impossible you
[06:29] know know so anytime I have an
[06:31] opportunity to I tell somebody else like
[06:34] hey if you're doing a awesome job at
[06:37] this I'm like I'm oppressed with this I
[06:42] like to take that that opportunity yeah
[06:45] it's uh really fascinating because I
[06:48] could see through the comment that
[06:50] there's a person that actually deeply
[06:52] thinks about stuff like when you see the
[06:55] comment you're like okay he just like
[06:57] wants to like there are a lot of
[06:59] different types of comments there's the
[07:01] the short supporter sty of comments that
[07:03] I really appreciate like hey Robin
[07:05] thanks they like comenting on almost
[07:08] every video they're just dropping a
[07:09] comment to support the algorithms and I
[07:11] really appreciate that kind of effort
[07:14] then there are the few types that saw
[07:16] the thumbnail and title and they did not
[07:17] like the thumbnail and title did not
[07:19] watch the video and just coming in and
[07:21] as you said like quickly stabbing in
[07:24] going out and making like some some
[07:26] hateful thing uh I I try to like uh
[07:30] react with with kindness or not at all
[07:33] to those S of of comments because they
[07:35] probably also come from a from a hard
[07:37] time they also come from a from a bad
[07:39] place uh so I don't want to contribute
[07:42] to to to to their bad place even more uh
[07:47] so I just like try to be be kind and and
[07:50] be loving with them I think that it's
[07:52] the best strategy with them and then
[07:54] there are other comments that are like
[07:55] really long as yours where you can
[07:57] actually read you and like oh [ __ ] he
[08:00] actually listen to the whole podcast and
[08:02] he actually thought about uh what's uh
[08:06] additionally to the video maybe
[08:08] important maybe uh can actually lead to
[08:11] to some some bigger conversations and
[08:14] that's why I was only on Twitter before
[08:17] this year uh on Twitter I was used to
[08:19] those small comments like there's really
[08:21] a long comment because for first of all
[08:25] you have to have the Twitter
[08:26] subscription you have to pay for even
[08:28] being able to like read uh write really
[08:31] long things otherwise you're constrained
[08:34] with the I think 360 character is uh and
[08:39] uh if you want to on on YouTube I
[08:42] discovered there are really long
[08:43] comments also and not as much as in the
[08:46] early days I I don't want was on the
[08:48] early days on YouTube that much on
[08:50] because I was so so tiny and so so young
[08:54] uh back there uh but yeah I lived on
[08:56] YouTube now since like at least like six
[08:59] seven and years I'm like really long
[09:01] always on on on YouTube and I'm a big
[09:03] believer in giving every everyone a
[09:06] stage like that's why I I didn't like I
[09:08] did not knew you at all I just like saw
[09:11] saw on beef and he's like giving those
[09:14] those insights and I was like hey let's
[09:16] let's write him and hey you want to be
[09:18] on a podcast then you wrote me on
[09:20] Twitter and then we kind of came into
[09:21] this conversation and and then and I
[09:23] think it turns out to be a great uh
[09:26] podcast and yeah it's it's uh it's is
[09:29] there like before we start in in all
[09:31] those topics but is there a reason
[09:34] behind that sov beef uh uh uh uh handle
[09:39] that you use uh I'm just a meathead I've
[09:44] been a lifting weights since I was like
[09:46] a 14 um and I just always been sort of a
[09:51] meathead um I'm a blue collar guy um you
[09:56] know I come from a humble
[10:00] up Beginnings I suppose and uh I just
[10:03] liked you know when I was a younger I uh
[10:07] I just like to I read books and I lift
[10:10] weights and um I think for for my
[10:14] appearance um I don't think a lot of
[10:17] people would assume that I uh read books
[10:20] but they would assume I lift weights and
[10:23] they would just view me as sort of a
[10:25] meat head um and I I don't mind that at
[10:29] all because it it I gives me the
[10:32] opportunity
[10:33] to surprise people I think and um I
[10:38] always like when somebody's like oh
[10:40] you're not as dumb as I thought you were
[10:43] and um uh you're a lot more interesting
[10:46] than you appear to be and uh so I just
[10:49] like to playay on that and obviously
[10:52] sovereignty is um is a thing that I
[10:56] didn't think about at all until I got
[10:59] into a Bitcoin but now it's something I
[11:03] think about all the time and it's
[11:06] something that I seek and uh I think I
[11:09] think understanding that a sovereignty
[11:12] is not a binary it's that it's not that
[11:15] you're you're either Sovereign or you're
[11:18] not but rather it's it's there's a
[11:22] matrix of it and on one end is absolute
[11:26] uh it's it's it's within the uh
[11:30] the a freedom scale and on a one end of
[11:33] it is is absolute a sovereignty on the
[11:37] the other end of it is absolute a
[11:39] slavery and so somewhere in between
[11:42] there is where everybody lies because no
[11:44] matter what you do you you can't be
[11:48] absolutely Sovereign and also no matter
[11:50] what you do you can't be an absolute
[11:52] slave to somebody either because they
[11:54] will always have the the power of a
[11:57] choice no matter what and so I think
[12:00] like exploring sovereignty and and
[12:04] uh you know I I think about these ideas
[12:08] all the time because um I know you
[12:11] mentioned um you know this is somebody
[12:14] who obviously thinks about things and
[12:18] the reason for that is because I'm I'm a
[12:20] a machine operator so I'm I'm alone in a
[12:24] machine for about a 10 hours a day um
[12:29] almost every day now you know I I can
[12:31] work a 900 hour weeks um I'm not I'm not
[12:34] always there all the time but but it's
[12:37] it's not uncommon for me to have a 50 60
[12:41] hours alone in a machine every week and
[12:45] so I can do either a lot of podcasts a
[12:49] lot of audio books uh sometimes I'll
[12:52] listen to a music but honestly there's
[12:56] there's a many hours where I have no
[12:59] headphones on and and it's just me and
[13:02] I'm uh performing um a job that's pretty
[13:07] monotonous and I can I can separate my
[13:10] thoughts uh from my actions and I can
[13:14] just I think about things and I realize
[13:19] that that is not a a luxury that most
[13:23] people
[13:24] have most people have to get up and go
[13:28] to work and start their day and they
[13:30] have to interact with people and they
[13:32] always have to kind of be
[13:35] be Ved in the world around them and I
[13:40] don't have to um for a long stretches of
[13:43] time and the ability to think on things
[13:47] for hours and hours without interruption
[13:51] allows you to really start to examine
[13:54] things in a way that prior to this I
[13:57] never did I never had the opportunity to
[14:00] I never thought to like ask things like
[14:01] what is a a
[14:04] sovereignty and and and what are the
[14:07] ends of a freedom and and and things
[14:10] like a value and things like a money
[14:14] what is a money is a question I ask all
[14:17] the time and I also ask the a value
[14:20] question I'm asking myself these things
[14:22] all the time because I don't think that
[14:24] you answer these things you just explore
[14:27] them over and over and over again and
[14:31] your viewpoint on all this stuff changes
[14:33] all the time do do you think that um
[14:36] because you have that speech disorder
[14:38] and because uh you work in in a job
[14:41] where you can actually long think uh
[14:44] that you like more into writing stuff
[14:46] because I think people that write a lot
[14:49] are more um thoughtful that people that
[14:53] don't write a lot I unfortunately don't
[14:55] write enough I I want to write more and
[14:58] I think I could could improve a lot on
[15:00] my thoughtfulness and a lot on on my
[15:02] thinking in general when I write more uh
[15:05] and in that way do you think that like
[15:07] that lead you to like coming to such an
[15:11] early place where you're in Bitcoin
[15:12] because we're really early in Bitcoin
[15:15] when you see how many people actually
[15:17] have Bitcoin uh that's a really small
[15:19] number and yesterday I heard the number
[15:21] how many bitcoiners have a hardware
[15:24] wallet for example how many people
[15:26] actually understand Bitcoin and it's
[15:28] like 2% 2% of bitcoiners have a hardware
[15:31] wallet and I would say
[15:34] like most of the people that have a
[15:36] hardware wallet and have the Bitcoin on
[15:38] on on on their hardare wallet at least
[15:40] understand Bitcoin do a good amount not
[15:44] everyone that has a hard wallet and
[15:46] Bitcoin understands Bitcoin to a full
[15:48] amount nobody understands it to a full
[15:49] amount but you you know what I mean um
[15:53] do do you do you think that like that
[15:55] all led to you like actually being one
[15:58] of this really early uh Bitcoin adopters
[16:01] I think so yeah I mean I I stumbled upon
[16:04] it you know I to be honest with you my
[16:07] first um I mean to like to answer that
[16:11] really like a writing allows me to
[16:14] export things absolutely but I don't get
[16:16] to write as much as I want to just
[16:19] because I'm I'm operating a machine all
[16:22] day long but
[16:25] um in my a SP time I loved to out to
[16:29] write and I did do so every day I write
[16:33] down my dolls every day I a journal
[16:37] every day and then I write a novels too
[16:40] so I'm I'm always outlining a story for
[16:44] a new book and that's like that's a
[16:47] hobby or a passion of mine that I've
[16:50] always had and that you know eventually
[16:53] when I'm when I'm retired and and I have
[16:56] time to sit down to I write every day I
[16:59] will do that but I think that my my
[17:02] introduction to thoin was not I I I
[17:06] first used fcoin in 2015 and it was um
[17:10] at the time I I I only only viewed it as
[17:14] a p2b a service it was it was a
[17:17] technology that allowed me to send funds
[17:22] uh across time and space and that was it
[17:25] and and it's it's funny now that
[17:29] you know it's considered such a good
[17:32] store of value now and and obviously
[17:36] with more adoption we we want this to
[17:39] become the ultimate store of value
[17:41] obviously but my first introduction to
[17:46] bitcoin was like do not a hold this
[17:49] thing because it's so a volatile that
[17:53] and I experienced it myself where I
[17:56] would I would I would put money into a a
[18:00] wallet and I would go to send that and I
[18:03] wouldn't have enough
[18:06] to complete the transaction within a few
[18:09] seconds because the the price had
[18:13] dropped so significantly that it was
[18:15] like I had to I put more money on so I
[18:19] was you know I would use it and send
[18:22] money buy things online um and just uh
[18:27] and did I didn't I think about it again
[18:30] and
[18:33] it I wasn't until
[18:35] 2020 where I was like
[18:38] oh down to get valuable now I got I got
[18:42] wrecked in uh 2017 so the the end of
[18:46] 2017 I got I so I had some a left over
[18:52] and a wallet um and I was just kind of
[18:54] sitting there and then then the price
[18:57] hit 20,000 for the first time it was on
[19:01] the way up there I checked it and I
[19:03] thought oh wow I got a few hundred in
[19:05] here now and I I only kept a few dollars
[19:08] in there and
[19:10] uh I got like a fomo a fever I had no
[19:15] experience with investing whatsoever and
[19:18] I bought at like 19,000 and uh it was
[19:22] not long after that that I saw
[19:24] everything sliding down so I I sold
[19:27] 13,000
[19:29] and after that I I had this sort of like
[19:31] I'm not doing that again and it was like
[19:33] this like thing then and I think a lot
[19:36] of people have experiences like that
[19:38] their
[19:39] first experience is to a foom o in and
[19:45] then I lose all their money or lose some
[19:48] of their money and then to back away
[19:50] from it and then they go and tell
[19:53] everybody that they can that a Bitcoin
[19:56] sucks and it's a scam and they're going
[19:58] to lose all their money in it and then
[20:01] after a few years hopefully they come
[20:04] back like I did and start to explore
[20:06] things
[20:08] more I love that story and I think a lot
[20:11] of people resonate with that story uh
[20:13] they get in they get out the they see
[20:16] the price run up and and and price run
[20:20] down and uh they get humbled by it I
[20:22] just today I released a video how I got
[20:25] humbled by Bitcoin because I said for
[20:27] three years straight that Bitcoin is a
[20:29] scam uh which is obviously wasn't but I
[20:33] had three years that opinion and
[20:34] sometimes I just ran out of arguments
[20:36] and actually uh discovered it myself um
[20:41] when when you talk about sovereignty uh
[20:42] it was really interesting for me to how
[20:44] you explain like okay that's slavery and
[20:46] there's sovereignty uh and everyone is
[20:48] kind of in between there somewhere um
[20:52] how do you define full absolute
[20:54] sovereignty like how is like the how
[20:57] would you say it's like the the the the
[20:58] gold standard of of sovereignty and and
[21:01] freedom for you I don't I don't know if
[21:04] it exists for a human being and and like
[21:10] because when you choose sovereignty it
[21:14] puts you at risk for so much
[21:18] you there's no see
[21:21] like then you choose to um but then you
[21:26] slide towards a slavery the
[21:32] compensation that you get is is an
[21:35] illusion of a safety and protection it's
[21:40] always I always look at things through a
[21:43] Libertarian uh perspective because
[21:45] that's where I developed a lot of my
[21:47] early ideas and I always think that like
[21:50] the state offers you the illusion of
[21:55] safety through Conformity and compliance
[21:59] and as long as you do what the state
[22:02] recommends that you do and you follow
[22:05] their rules nobody um will will uh come
[22:11] to try to hurt you or nobody will take
[22:13] away your stuff they'll they'll leave
[22:15] you alone in peace for you to to watch
[22:18] Netflix and you know order over eats and
[22:21] all that stuff that the that makes it
[22:24] seem like you're in control of your life
[22:28] but to be truly on your own without uh
[22:33] without this state Overlord in you or
[22:38] without the illusion of a safety
[22:42] protecting you from things really puts
[22:44] you at risk for a lot of things there's
[22:48] there's there's heavy
[22:51] danger the idea that uh freedom is not a
[22:54] free I I always ask I go is it free I
[22:59] I'll ask that question all the time like
[23:01] is freedom free and if it's not free how
[23:04] much do you have to pay for it how do
[23:06] you have to pay for what is the cost of
[23:08] it and I think that the cost of a
[23:11] freedom is
[23:13] like danger and it's the the constant
[23:16] threat of at a very basic level uh your
[23:23] life is at stake if you're if
[23:26] you're a living alone in the woods
[23:29] somewhere and you rely on nobody and
[23:33] nobody can control you you have to feed
[23:35] yourself there are no grocery stores for
[23:38] you to do anything if you if you do not
[23:42] kill an animal or or a forge of food
[23:46] somehow you die and
[23:49] so the idea of absolute
[23:52] sovereignty
[23:55] um whether that even exists or not is is
[23:59] a thing that I don't think everybody
[24:01] wants or or a thing that I think
[24:04] everybody can even a handle we they want
[24:08] to be somewhere
[24:10] in the middle where we we sacrifice some
[24:14] of our sovereignty for the
[24:18] convenience of not having to do
[24:21] everything ourselves and that's like
[24:24] like as a Libertarian like I hear myself
[24:27] say that and like immediately am like
[24:31] resisting it immediately like I feel
[24:33] like no I want absolute sovereignty but
[24:37] I think if we're If we're honest with
[24:39] ourselves maybe not but I think in in a
[24:44] modern sense so a sovereignty just
[24:48] means absolutely a minimal State
[24:54] interference at a very very basic level
[24:58] is just I want the government to be as
[25:02] as as uninvolved in my life as a
[25:09] possible
[25:11] and then you say that there are
[25:16] tradeoffs and like Libertarians
[25:20] like like where the viewpoint on
[25:22] libertarianism begins to fall apart is
[25:25] like all right well who's going to take
[25:28] out you're garbage who's going to pave
[25:31] the streets it's it's like we the idea
[25:36] of like I'll do everything on my own all
[25:38] the time is is is a beautiful idea but
[25:43] the re a reality of it um like your life
[25:47] is not
[25:50] as productive as it is if you have some
[25:55] help from some some government form you
[26:00] know some
[26:02] governance doing things for you so it's
[26:05] like do we want sovereignty see like you
[26:09] you have to ask yourself these things
[26:12] and the there's no answer to it there's
[26:15] only the exploration of the
[26:19] idea let me ask you are there things in
[26:22] their life that you you have that are
[26:26] that are given to you but
[26:28] by the state or that are governed for
[26:32] you that you actually get a value out of
[26:35] yeah a lot of things for example the the
[26:38] the
[26:39] infrastructure the transport
[26:41] infrastructure in Europe is really good
[26:43] uh and it's
[26:44] mostly uh provided by uh the state I
[26:49] mean who's the state they collecting
[26:51] taxes they're deploying the taxes um but
[26:54] there's like two different concepts for
[26:56] me like there's this uh uh you don't
[26:59] want the state to be involved okay
[27:02] because you can also like hire private
[27:04] companies and they can maybe raise the
[27:07] and and the private company make the
[27:09] public transport systems the private
[27:11] companies make the uh the garbage
[27:13] disposal and stuff like that for example
[27:15] like the garbage also is like some
[27:17] government thing at least here in
[27:19] Austria so um there's no question about
[27:23] it you always are depending on other
[27:25] people that's like it it comes comes
[27:28] down to that I'm depending on other
[27:31] people I'm depending on uh my girlfriend
[27:33] not stabbing me in the back in the night
[27:36] I'm depending on uh when I'm sitting in
[27:38] a plane that the the pilot is not
[27:41] crashing the plane I'm always depending
[27:43] on other people and always trusting
[27:45] other people so that concept of complete
[27:48] trustless like you can verify everything
[27:51] and you don't have to trust anyone
[27:52] that's completely [ __ ] I think
[27:54] because you always have to trust other
[27:56] people and that's not a bad thing we
[27:58] should trust each other like we are
[28:00] function in society we work together we
[28:02] trust each other uh and and and there's
[28:05] always like even in that podcast is is a
[28:07] trust in there I trust you to to to to
[28:11] give your best to to speak the best and
[28:13] and give the best content here you trust
[28:15] me to present you then in the title in
[28:18] the thumbnail and everything the best
[28:20] way so like there's there's always a a
[28:23] tradeoff and a trust involved and other
[28:25] people involved no matter what we do uh
[28:28] the only question with Libertarians I
[28:30] feel like that there a question like how
[28:32] much should we centralize organize with
[28:34] with taxes and and with with the
[28:36] government and and with democracy and
[28:39] then there's the whole libertarian few
[28:41] where like we don't need them we can do
[28:44] everything privately because there will
[28:47] be a hole in the market for someone to
[28:49] get the garbage off of the streets and
[28:52] and people that live on those streets
[28:53] will pay for that and they will like
[28:55] build some Alliance and say like hey I'm
[28:57] willing toay like1 per per month to to
[29:01] you to get the garbage out and there
[29:03] will be a market for that so I can see
[29:06] that there then there also the other
[29:08] thing like how do we solve um disputes
[29:11] because uh if if someone screws me over
[29:16] let's first put the podcast at example I
[29:19] uh display you in that podcast
[29:22] completely and and I do it in a in a way
[29:24] where it's actually really bad for for
[29:26] your reputation or like I me make you
[29:28] fun of you or something like that uh
[29:30] then you can basically
[29:33] um I don't know the English word for it
[29:35] but you can basically U Get me in front
[29:39] of a judge and say like hey he should
[29:41] get the video off and he should pay a
[29:43] fine for that and stuff like that
[29:44] there's a dispute there's like two
[29:46] opinions on that uh and and there is
[29:49] someone in the middle the state that has
[29:51] a monopoly on violence they can actually
[29:54] add act on that and he's like no Robin
[29:57] sorry you're wrong take the video off
[29:59] and pay him Edie 2,000 fine or something
[30:03] like that um and I can say no yeah you
[30:07] know what I think that that's where the
[30:10] the perspective really falls apart is in
[30:14] the the uh punishment of crimes because
[30:18] everything is going to be a monetarily a
[30:21] based and
[30:24] and that's not enough of a penalty
[30:28] to to stop people from
[30:32] their behavior especially people who
[30:35] already don't have a
[30:37] money the idea of of imp imprisoning
[30:42] somebody if they behave a certain way is
[30:46] is the
[30:49] best deterrent that we have for for uh
[30:54] uh criminal Behavior unfortunately it's
[30:58] it's never going to be a perfect system
[31:02] but that's honestly it does work you
[31:05] know there are a lot of times when I
[31:08] would like to uh inflict a violence on
[31:12] other people but I don't because there's
[31:15] one thing that I think you know what
[31:17] would really suck is if I was in a
[31:19] prison and I I have to I have to a away
[31:23] these things out and say
[31:25] like is this fleeting moment of anger a
[31:29] worth a few years of my life Behind Bars
[31:33] and that's I don't mind that structure
[31:37] for society but there are there are
[31:41] certain things that the the Libertarians
[31:44] nail on the head and there are things
[31:45] that they just they that like they
[31:49] can't they can't solve for and I think
[31:53] centralization is one of the biggest
[31:56] things because
[31:58] if you allow the free market to just up
[32:02] be free it eventually all leads to a
[32:07] centralized a
[32:09] gigantism like
[32:11] these investment funds who own
[32:14] everything like we have essentially a
[32:16] free market in the United States it's
[32:18] free market but it's it's being
[32:20] manipulated um and it's not free because
[32:23] obviously the the money's not free but
[32:29] we have the illusion of a free market
[32:32] and under that illusion we see you know
[32:37] a a firm like a black rock just
[32:41] completely dominate everything and I
[32:44] would be horrified if the back Rock
[32:47] owned the roads or if they owned the
[32:50] ocean or the Lakes the water supplies or
[32:55] they owned all the this s ization plans
[32:58] you know they might actually I don't
[33:00] know but I would be I would be horrified
[33:03] if if if the free market just allowed
[33:07] you know eventually this consolidation
[33:10] into this centralized a format of of
[33:14] everything and and um I think that you
[33:18] need some
[33:19] some some form of governance to prevent
[33:23] that and there's an really interesting
[33:26] and and important point in there
[33:28] uh because everything is good as long we
[33:32] as we have a choice like if if a company
[33:36] owns the one company owns the whole
[33:38] water supply that's obviously really bad
[33:42] because then we cannot choose uh the the
[33:45] the water freely but if we have like oh
[33:47] there's like public water there's like a
[33:50] private water then I can buy water from
[33:53] here I can freely choose uh what water I
[33:55] get and this this is with everything in
[33:59] in in our lives with everything that we
[34:01] we kind of do we we want the choice like
[34:04] in some sense uh I don't think we have a
[34:07] good competition in smartphones like
[34:08] there's apple and there's Google and
[34:11] then there's a lot of nothing of
[34:13] obviously there other people also but
[34:14] Google Apple kind of have like this two
[34:16] Monopoly on that but it's even good that
[34:19] we have at least two like that it's
[34:21] really good that not just Apple because
[34:24] uh when Apple screws something up Google
[34:26] will point that out and do something and
[34:29] the other way around so like kind of
[34:30] like apple protects us that Google
[34:32] doesn't screw us over and Google
[34:34] protects us Apple doesn't screw over
[34:35] it's not a perfect free market because
[34:37] we we I would prefer more major players
[34:41] so like that's why I also encourage I
[34:44] would encourage El to actually do a
[34:45] Tesla phone or an X phone or something
[34:48] like that and other like we need
[34:50] competition every sense we need
[34:53] competition especially in all those
[34:55] highly centralized place I do do that
[34:57] podcast on YouTube that YouTube is right
[35:00] now like the the TV of the internet that
[35:02] those are where the long format videos
[35:04] are living uh and it's kind of free uh
[35:08] but there's censoring going on there's
[35:09] other things going on so it would be
[35:12] great if tw Twitter is actually uh in a
[35:15] place where they can get a competition
[35:17] on a long format video that they are
[35:20] trying but did not do it successfully
[35:22] till now it would be great competition
[35:24] is always amazing because it forces
[35:26] everyone to be better and that's like
[35:28] the I think that's the libertarian view
[35:30] we we need a market that allows uh
[35:36] allows free competition to arrive and
[35:39] and not have someone own everything so
[35:42] that's why even a free market a complete
[35:45] free market I think needs some rules uh
[35:49] and and maybe even rulers where we like
[35:52] like even a football game when you look
[35:54] at a football game every player can do
[35:56] whatever they want in there but there
[35:58] are certain rules they cannot do in
[36:00] order so that uh because like for
[36:04] example let's let's imagine there is no
[36:07] rules in in
[36:08] soccer uh and the other team has a
[36:11] really good uh scorer and he's like just
[36:14] always making the goals an easy thing to
[36:17] do is like hey the first time he comes
[36:20] on just chump him really badly in there
[36:22] and then he's out because he has to go
[36:24] to the hospital that's not allowed
[36:27] because then when he does that he gets a
[36:28] red card and maybe he's like even uh
[36:31] blocked a few games from playing and
[36:34] maybe even if it's really bad and and we
[36:36] might get even like outside of the
[36:39] football Court in the actual Court
[36:42] problems if it's really a bad attack uh
[36:44] but then it has to be really something
[36:46] major so there there are certain rules
[36:48] that make sense but what I think is we
[36:51] got a little bit too manyy rules we got
[36:53] a little bit too too much State
[36:56] involvement and in the whole sense but
[36:58] yeah it's it's an interesting question
[37:00] to think like where where is freedom
[37:02] like what is the definition of freedom
[37:04] and how can we ensure that the
[37:06] individual is as free as possible uh and
[37:11] uh ensuring still a a free market
[37:13] overall and not uh put putting any
[37:17] constraints on anyone that's like a
[37:19] really hard topic still for me I'm like
[37:21] I was in politics before I'm not now I'm
[37:23] in Bitcoin I talk so much about Freedom
[37:26] it's just a a topic that is also not
[37:28] really thought of in in my head if I had
[37:30] a fine answer for that I probably had a
[37:33] book out of that yeah yeah a freedom is
[37:37] is an interesting one because I always
[37:40] hear it all the time but I but there's
[37:43] no differentiation when people discuss
[37:47] it there are really two
[37:51] freedoms there's the freedom from and
[37:55] there's the freedom to
[37:58] these are two different
[38:01] concepts a lot of people conflate them
[38:04] or whatever but but you can have freedom
[38:08] from
[38:09] something and it feels a lot different
[38:12] than having
[38:14] the the freedom to do something and I
[38:18] think that that that real freedom is
[38:21] freedom to and freedom from is more like
[38:25] relief
[38:27] um or it can also be disguised as
[38:31] escapism a lot of people like like I
[38:34] could have the freedom
[38:37] from paying my bills the I could have
[38:41] the the freedom from my responsibility I
[38:45] could achieve that if I go out and I and
[38:50] I'm uh with my friends and we're having
[38:53] a few drinks and now for that time
[38:56] period I'm free free from the thoughts
[39:00] of responsibility and it seems like I've
[39:03] achieved a level of a freedom there but
[39:06] it's only an illusion it's escapism it's
[39:09] not actual a freedom I've only escaped
[39:12] it temporarily and so now I'm I'm
[39:16] somewhere else my my a mind is elsewhere
[39:19] and it's free from a thing but I don't
[39:22] have the freedom to live my life without
[39:26] responsibility I've only escaped it for
[39:29] a moment and so when we understand that
[39:32] there's there's a freedom from things
[39:35] and there's Freedom two things what we
[39:38] what the humans want is freedom too
[39:42] that's the the big thing but we can't
[39:44] get that unless we have freedom from
[39:47] first so like we freedom from over
[39:52] over restriction we need freedom from
[39:56] people trying to uh cause us harm like
[40:00] all of and like that comes in the form
[40:02] of a safety right the the freedom too
[40:06] and this goes back to to to
[40:09] sovereignty the freedom too allows us to
[40:13] be to put ourselves in in danger to put
[40:16] ourselves at risk then you start a
[40:20] business let's say in in a capitalistic
[40:23] Society you have the freedom to put
[40:26] yourself at risk to the point where the
[40:29] that
[40:31] business could fail and you and the the
[40:35] freedom to do that only comes when
[40:38] there's a freedom from the the
[40:41] Restriction of it so it's like you have
[40:43] these two ends of it and they're they're
[40:46] always at play with each other and
[40:48] they're always involved but like I ask
[40:52] myself all the time you know freedom
[40:55] from or freedom to and I I I think it
[40:58] goes back to how we Define a freedom
[41:03] remember that Cardone was on and I love
[41:07] that episode that was the first episode
[41:09] that I listened and um I was like this
[41:12] is awesome and um and like he talked
[41:16] about a freedom a lot but I think what
[41:20] he
[41:21] was talking about was really
[41:24] Independence he was saying that he wants
[41:26] the freedom to say no to people or the
[41:29] freedom
[41:29] to say yes to people you know the
[41:32] freedom to do that he wants essentially
[41:35] and to to choose these things I look at
[41:38] that as more
[41:40] Independence I think I think freedom is
[41:43] all about a time like that
[41:48] that escapism seems like freedom because
[41:53] for for that time period you you feel
[41:58] free and so I think I think freedom is
[42:02] all about the ability to be a present in
[42:07] the moment and engaged in what you're
[42:10] doing fully without this I have to wake
[42:15] up in the morning I have to go to work I
[42:19] have this obligation in the future real
[42:21] real freedom is to just
[42:24] be be a present and to be at one with
[42:28] what
[42:30] with that's happening around you that's
[42:34] like the real a freedom from and freedom
[42:39] to combin thank you you already made it
[42:42] halfway through the video and I'm really
[42:44] really grateful to have you here two
[42:46] things make this channel possible you as
[42:49] a watcher and listener who keep
[42:50] supporting this Channel and another one
[42:53] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[42:55] up with like 21 bitco coin who support
[42:58] me from the very start and where I
[43:00] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[43:02] Robin you even get a discount when you
[43:04] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[43:06] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[43:09] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[43:12] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[43:14] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[43:17] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[43:19] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[43:23] bracket and if you have self custody and
[43:25] you know your friend does not have maybe
[43:26] he needs needs a Christmas present maybe
[43:28] he needs a birth present and a small
[43:30] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[43:32] 5% off your order plus you support my
[43:36] channel and now let's get back to the
[43:38] video yeah I also love the the episode
[43:40] with Gary a lot it's still also my most
[43:42] successful episode uh probably Michael
[43:45] saor will will will crush him but but
[43:49] till now it's still the most watched
[43:51] episode um that's such an uh unique
[43:54] perspective for for example I never
[43:56] heard that freedom from and freedom to
[44:00] uh aspect to it I have to rewatch that
[44:02] when when I'm adding that because I I
[44:05] don't think I understood it fully you
[44:07] did a great job in explaining it but
[44:09] it's a A New Concept for me and it's
[44:11] really uh it could be really profound uh
[44:14] it's also like I never shared on another
[44:17] podcast but often the guest says
[44:19] something and I'm like oh that's
[44:21] something completely new uh and I don't
[44:24] fully grasp it and then I edit it I'm
[44:26] like oh [ __ ] that's like that's actually
[44:29] profound and I actually just understand
[44:31] it because like when you have to podcast
[44:33] you and you're the interviewer the host
[44:35] you're always like you're listening but
[44:36] you're always like trying like okay
[44:38] where we can go with the conversation so
[44:41] uh the the the the listening is better
[44:43] if you can actually just focus on the
[44:44] listening I'm trying to get better uh in
[44:47] this skill and I I notice that it gets
[44:49] better with every episode I do so I can
[44:52] listen actually grasp what you're saying
[44:55] and lead the conversation which like a
[44:58] lot of do in I one and I hope I hope I
[45:00] do a good job in that uh but when we
[45:03] talk about those freedoms and the whole
[45:06] concept that that you now described do
[45:09] you think that Bitcoin leads us uh to a
[45:12] world that looks more like that I hope
[45:15] so it can you know I think that that's
[45:18] that's obviously what all of
[45:21] us could hope for you know I I I love
[45:28] Thorn I wear this hat every day in hopes
[45:31] that somebody uh sees it and asks me
[45:35] about it and every now and then I I I
[45:38] get the opportunity to orange pill
[45:40] somebody or or I try to at least and you
[45:44] know I'm like a 5% success rate with it
[45:48] but also there's there's always a
[45:50] learning curve to it but I I also have
[45:53] to to a view things from a realistic
[45:58] perspective too and like I ask myself
[46:01] things
[46:02] like like what are the choke points of
[46:06] this you know and I
[46:08] I I always like to I'm afraid of the ETF
[46:13] more than anything else I'm afraid of
[46:16] there being a large enough
[46:20] uh percentage of the
[46:23] supplies stuck in there that it
[46:26] essentially renders
[46:28] it a useless for anybody as
[46:32] a a medium of exchange it's it's
[46:37] portability is a reduced through the
[46:41] ATF and that's why I don't view I
[46:45] view the ETF version of Bitcoin as less
[46:50] a valuable than the the self tesy
[46:53] version of it because the
[46:57] portability aspect of it is I taken
[47:01] away and I think I think that I think
[47:05] that the
[47:06] people investing in the ETF don't
[47:10] understand
[47:11] that and they're they don't understand
[47:14] that that that they're not actually
[47:17] holding they're not actually um
[47:21] in test the of the full value of of the
[47:27] technology and that they
[47:30] they th it away
[47:32] voluntarily and so I'm I'm afraid of of
[47:37] of large scale adoption into the atfs
[47:42] prior to this understanding that
[47:45] everybody has when then we talk about
[47:48] self custody so I mean I you know we we
[47:51] get talk all day about about if it's
[47:55] going to be um
[47:58] the a medium of exchange for the world
[48:01] someday I know that's that that's a big
[48:03] thing it has to become a store of value
[48:07] first
[48:09] I they already tried it as a medium of
[48:13] exchange of first and and and and it it
[48:18] doesn't work unless the the values
[48:22] completely stabilized first and I I
[48:26] think after that happens though needing
[48:29] of exchange uh Global monetary system
[48:33] for everybody to use and free and
[48:37] available and accessible and and and uh
[48:41] like all of the beautiful philosophical
[48:44] things that we talk about all day long
[48:47] about that happens when
[48:49] when the world's money is a free I think
[48:53] it happens super fast
[48:57] because the
[48:59] incentives to use this thing that
[49:02] everybody has already as money will be
[49:06] so high and so valuable that whoever can
[49:10] produce a product like that like
[49:13] lightning which you know
[49:17] but
[49:19] the
[49:20] the aspect of it being a medium of
[49:24] exchange will be too valuable for not to
[49:28] happen so th a value first everybody has
[49:33] this thing and everybody understands it
[49:37] and then it just
[49:39] naturally
[49:42] becomes a money then naturally I love
[49:47] your fews a lot and I like how you are
[49:50] you how you have a based view on the
[49:53] stuff and and for thef stuff is really
[49:55] interesting I mean they like the the one
[49:58] side to is like that says no it's it's
[50:01] never um a threat because it's just the
[50:04] supply of it and it cannot really do
[50:06] anything with Bitcoin but if you have a
[50:08] lot of Bitcoin uh then you can do stuff
[50:11] with it I personally right now don't see
[50:13] it as a threat uh but I see a path where
[50:17] when they get a major stake in Bitcoin
[50:21] which you don't have till now a really a
[50:23] major stake um then I could
[50:27] imagine it being a threat uh but also
[50:32] the other point is like when Bitcoin is
[50:33] actually the sound money that we think
[50:35] it is then it has to withstand that if
[50:39] if a ETF corrupts Bitcoin then Bitcoin
[50:41] was never the sound money that we
[50:43] thought it is that's a beauty of it like
[50:45] if real sound money it doesn't matter
[50:47] what anyone does with it it withstands
[50:50] any attack from anybody and Bitcoin
[50:53] already withstand really big attacks I
[50:56] think back of the block size War I think
[50:58] back of of even uh El musk tested it
[51:02] kind of like I see El musk what he did
[51:04] as an tried attack he was the richest
[51:06] Mana life at this point I think he he
[51:09] still is and he really like adopted it
[51:12] and then trashed on it h and what
[51:15] happened like the priz was at X then it
[51:18] got two xed and then he went back to X
[51:21] like it had like no effects on on El
[51:23] musk of course he crashed it but first
[51:25] he also drove it up so
[51:27] uh so the the the more people they come
[51:30] in Bitcoin the more attacks it gets the
[51:33] bigger it also gets and the more
[51:35] resilient it gets and if Bitcoin is
[51:38] actually the sound money that it is and
[51:39] I believe it is I could be wrong like
[51:42] future and history will tell me uh then
[51:47] Bitcoin with Will withstand any attack
[51:49] even black rocks and ETFs attacks uh and
[51:53] uh yeah it's it's interesting and I made
[51:56] uh we disc I disc discussed that with uh
[51:59] Michael saor because that question came
[52:01] up a lot oh is ETFs a threat and he said
[52:04] something interesting that I don't know
[52:06] if it's entirely true I don't know if I
[52:09] stand behind that opinion but it's an
[52:10] interesting Viewpoint he said like the
[52:12] ETFs is a further
[52:15] decentralization of Bitcoin it's another
[52:18] player in the game uh and uh he also
[52:22] described like when micro strategy came
[52:24] in and when other people came in
[52:27] then all of a sudden El Salvador comes
[52:29] in now black R comes in and and then
[52:31] there's another player coming every
[52:33] player uh pulls in One Direction uh and
[52:37] the players are getting more and more
[52:39] decentralized and more and more uh
[52:41] influential also uh where we come to
[52:44] this point like nobody can change
[52:47] Bitcoin because there are too many
[52:51] influential people and too many sides
[52:54] rubbing on each other uh it's that kind
[52:57] this thing like in the middle and it's
[52:58] really stable I love that VI how do you
[53:01] how do you feel it do do you can you
[53:03] also see the argument there it's like it
[53:06] might be like a decentralization of that
[53:10] uh and and I mean yeah it definitely
[53:13] could also be in threat like I I
[53:14] definitely see that also yeah well I
[53:17] think I mean I just like to be aware
[53:21] of the potential for it to go bad and I
[53:26] also think like the like
[53:30] we're moving away
[53:34] from a people like individuals
[53:38] or or even Nations uh being able
[53:42] to um affect it negatively you know it's
[53:47] like we're we're we we sort of escape
[53:51] the a meme episode of where you know
[53:54] somebody can say something and and then
[53:56] oh no it's thr is zero because that guy
[54:00] said so and so I have to sell all my
[54:03] Bitcoin now I think we've escaped that
[54:06] but that was that was the re a reality
[54:11] for a few years there you know if it's
[54:15] if if you heard something from a
[54:18] prominent voice that was negative about
[54:21] it the our price went down all the time
[54:25] now you know know I don't really see
[54:28] that being a problem anymore now the the
[54:32] threat is going to be from government
[54:35] regulation
[54:37] which as of now it seems to be on our
[54:40] side with it you know but
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] um yeah the EXE the executive order 6102
[54:49] is nothing that could really not happen
[54:52] like that that could it could be reality
[54:55] like when the feeld currency getting
[54:58] more and more instable and more and more
[54:59] to a crashing scenario uh and then the
[55:03] state is seeing Oh there's all those
[55:05] Bitcoins in all those ETFs and Bitcoin
[55:07] has actual value and actually drives up
[55:10] uh and we could use those Bitcoin to
[55:12] stabilize the US dollar stabilize feat
[55:15] currencies um it's
[55:18] something where right now I cannot
[55:20] imagine it but it's not impossible for
[55:23] the
[55:24] future uh but it will be really
[55:27] interesting uh the the future of Bitcoin
[55:30] yeah have you considered how the ETFs
[55:35] might uh fail as a a financial
[55:40] instrument you mean when uh the price
[55:43] doesn't run up in like the one one year
[55:46] and and then the clients are upset or I
[55:49] just mean
[55:51] when the ETFs themselves go to zero
[55:59] considered a pathway for that yet
[56:02] because
[56:05] well did you trade your Bitcoin right
[56:07] now for an equal amount in the
[56:10] ATF uh not at all like I I don't want
[56:14] ETFs did you trade their Bitcoin right
[56:17] now for two times the amount of it in
[56:21] atfs I mean if I have the chance to
[56:25] trade it back like 10 minutes after that
[56:28] no no
[56:29] no no have to hold it for a year after
[56:33] that then it's hard because um like
[56:37] first of all why would they offer me
[56:39] that like I would be very suspicious
[56:41] suspicious why would someone offer me
[56:43] that but even if that side is not the
[56:46] case do I trust them enough to don't
[56:50] [ __ ] up a
[56:51] year because I might get double but I
[56:54] might also get nothing uh and that can
[56:57] something happen uh I mean that is
[57:01] really hard to say I think um Bitcoin
[57:04] grows itself really into the system
[57:07] where it might get to a state where even
[57:10] when coinbase gets hacked and there are
[57:13] some Bitcoin stole there might be even
[57:15] the case where like the government steps
[57:17] in and says like oh there are some there
[57:19] the we're not at this stage right now
[57:21] but we could be at this stage like oh no
[57:23] no no that that would be too detrimental
[57:26] to the to the system we need to support
[57:29] the Bitcoin ETFs like that would be that
[57:31] would be a meme in itself but I would
[57:35] never trade for any price uh my Bitcoin
[57:39] because first of all I'm satisfied with
[57:42] my stack It's never enough but I'm
[57:45] satisfied with it so I'm like oh I I
[57:48] want to gamble it and I want to get more
[57:50] because I could also do the same with
[57:51] [ __ ] coins like I I'm in a unique
[57:55] perspective
[57:56] uh where I see [ __ ] coins when they get
[58:00] promoted early on I see in my comments
[58:03] with the Bots and everything uh I always
[58:06] see and I sometimes even watch it when
[58:08] there's a new shitcoin coming out I see
[58:11] like oh it's now at that price and then
[58:13] a few weeks back when they really roll
[58:15] on the marketing machines and the Bots
[58:17] machines they're like oh it's like 10x
[58:19] that even like 50x that so like I
[58:22] definitely could make money with
[58:23] shitcoins and trading especially with my
[58:26] uh channels I see it really early on
[58:28] when they start marketing and then but I
[58:30] I'm just not interested in that I'm
[58:33] really not uh so there are a lot of
[58:36] possibilities for me to enhance my
[58:38] Bitcoin stack but I have peace with it I
[58:41] have a Bitcoin stack and I love what I
[58:44] do and that thing that I do enhances my
[58:48] Bitcoin stack and I'm satisfied with the
[58:51] pace of it I'm satisfied with my stack
[58:53] I'm satisfied with the pace of
[58:55] increasing that akake and I can wake up
[58:58] every day and do what I love like I
[59:01] don't need a shortcut I'm already there
[59:04] where I want to be and and that's the
[59:06] beautiful thing when you all of the
[59:08] sudden happy with your situation happy
[59:11] with your life and happy where you are
[59:13] you're not uh you're not that easily
[59:18] persuaded uh to shitty situations that
[59:22] might look like a good situation but
[59:24] easy situations like even uh I talked
[59:27] with a lot of people on that stuff like
[59:30] a lottery winners often I don't like I
[59:36] when I see someone like oh he wins the
[59:38] lottery I'm like huh let's see how he
[59:40] does in two years because he gets a
[59:43] crazy high and most cannot resist to
[59:46] actually like don't also spend their
[59:48] Bitcoin or not spend their Lottery wi
[59:50] and then they get even to a lower lower
[59:54] uh Point than they were before because
[59:56] they spent all the money and they had
[59:57] all those new friends and all those
[60:00] things that come with that wealth but at
[60:02] some point it will run out if you don't
[60:04] make more money that's why I'm a really
[60:06] big proponent of yes it's okay if you
[60:09] get wealthy yes it's it's amazing if you
[60:11] get wealthy into a good state but it's
[60:14] perfect it's it's best if you get it
[60:16] organically that's why I also have a lot
[60:19] of comp compassion with people that
[60:21] inherit a lot of wealth because they
[60:23] didn't only do it on the on themselves
[60:26] uh they might have knowledge about it
[60:28] but they always have this this thing on
[60:30] their shoulders like my dad did it and
[60:32] they hear that a lot like uh and they
[60:35] even if they don't hear it they feel it
[60:37] that the other person is like H yeah but
[60:40] you inherited your wealth you inherited
[60:42] company that's why you are successful so
[60:44] like I have a lot of like I have a
[60:45] friend of mine where the dad is really
[60:49] successful uh and I have been with like
[60:52] him like since like a small boy and I
[60:56] know how much he struggles because of
[60:58] his shadow of the big
[61:01] dead and so like I I don't know where
[61:04] why I went in this road now
[61:07] but I just like uh I forgot even where I
[61:11] started right now but it's like you have
[61:14] to have a lot of compassion with with
[61:16] those people and and yeah I completely
[61:18] forgot my my where I came from that it's
[61:22] okay I I I think for the a first time I
[61:26] think you're having a conversation with
[61:28] somebody more than you're interviewing
[61:31] them and so the idea of you just not
[61:35] thinking about what the next question is
[61:38] allows you to sort of explore yourself
[61:41] so here here right here's an awesome
[61:44] example of this you when you interview
[61:47] somebody you don't have the freedom to
[61:51] ramble because you're not free from the
[61:54] idea of I'm on a podcast I'm
[61:57] interviewing somebody this conversation
[62:00] somehow freed you
[62:02] from the responsibility of being the
[62:05] interviewer and gave you freedom to
[62:08] speak freely and to just explore ideas
[62:13] more and and you you
[62:15] lost you lost the pace of the interview
[62:19] but not the
[62:20] conversation now we're just having an
[62:22] organic conversation you're free in that
[62:26] moment now and that's what the that's
[62:29] what freedom is is it not have to worry
[62:32] about I can't sway too far this way
[62:35] because I don't want to forget we were
[62:38] talking about the atfs that's what we
[62:40] were talking about by the way and and
[62:42] then it just it just moved in that
[62:44] direction freedom to and freedom from
[62:48] now I let me go back a little bit
[62:51] because I because what that you said
[62:53] about uh trading your Bitcoin I think it
[62:57] was so it was so uh simple but yet
[63:02] profound that you're satisfied with your
[63:05] stack and you currently have the freedom
[63:10] to do anything you want with your stack
[63:14] right because you're holding it as soon
[63:17] as you trade it for an
[63:21] ATF you no longer have the freedom to do
[63:24] whatever you want with it you have the
[63:26] freedom from the responsibility of
[63:29] testing it you have the um I I suppose
[63:34] that's really it but like but you lose
[63:36] the freedom to use it
[63:41] however you want a freely to transfer it
[63:45] to people or to to invest with
[63:49] it they have to sell it that's the only
[63:52] way to to use it then I think that like
[63:56] I think that
[63:58] your the freedom that you have in
[64:01] holding your stack and being able to get
[64:03] up and do YouTube and all this stuff the
[64:07] freedom to it's it's
[64:10] free a money in this regard and the ATF
[64:15] doesn't represent that that's a that's a
[64:18] profound thought I love it and I you're
[64:21] right like there are most of my
[64:24] interviews I'm in the interview View
[64:26] mode like I try to get the best out of
[64:27] the the guest there's some instances uh
[64:30] that I already had those those
[64:32] experience where like it was more like a
[64:34] conversation it's also I try to less and
[64:39] less prepare for those interviews
[64:41] because I saw that when I'm overprepared
[64:44] it's not as good like it's better when
[64:46] I'm a little bit underprepared uh and
[64:49] I'm a little bit more with the guest and
[64:51] less with my preparation with topics and
[64:55] and things they want to get into um
[64:58] there's a obviously a healthy balance to
[65:00] it because I think I think if you show
[65:02] up always unprepared um you might miss a
[65:07] good chance like oh that's what we can
[65:09] speak about oh like because often in the
[65:12] the preparation phase I I see topics
[65:15] that are really interesting and then I
[65:16] can start at an interesting point uh and
[65:19] it sometimes deletes that um warming up
[65:22] phase you're like oh what are you doing
[65:24] and and getting into that conversation
[65:26] so it could accelerate the conversation
[65:29] to be faster interesting but it takes
[65:32] away from the organic development from a
[65:34] normal conversation and I'm aware of
[65:37] that so I have no like for example
[65:39] that's why Jo Rogan does it so long
[65:41] because he all like I think Jo Rong does
[65:43] not really I don't know I never
[65:45] researched if if he does or if he spoke
[65:48] about that publicly but I think Joe
[65:50] Rogan is just like oh let's let's sit
[65:53] down with him and has have a
[65:56] conversation and I also noticed
[65:59] that I do it usually 1 hour we now
[66:02] already at 1 hour 10 uh but uh I usually
[66:05] do like one hour one and a half hours on
[66:06] the podcast and I noticed that like the
[66:09] last half hour of the podcast is better
[66:11] than the first half hour of the podcast
[66:13] because you have to warm up I've never
[66:15] seen you before I have 99% of my guests
[66:18] I've never seen before uh in in a in a
[66:22] in a good sense some of my guests like I
[66:25] had yesterday the first time ever I had
[66:27] a guest on twice so that was already way
[66:32] better and it was amazing because it Al
[66:34] also was in person it's also a different
[66:36] feeling but yeah that's kind of what I
[66:38] uh wanted to add here uh yeah I like you
[66:41] know what let's like I wasn't uh
[66:45] prepared uh for any of this I've
[66:48] obviously never done a podcast before um
[66:51] I'm not a big a social media guy I've
[66:54] never uh this is probably my like third
[66:57] or fourth uh video call like I'm not
[67:01] used to like I don't know where to look
[67:04] exactly like all that you know I'm just
[67:07] uh I'm just like I'm I'm just like a
[67:10] bluecollar machine operator who leaves
[67:14] comments on a YouTube and now I'm
[67:17] talking to you and
[67:19] so I've had
[67:21] some a moments here where I was like
[67:24] what am I talking about I'm not making
[67:26] sense anymore I'm like am I still making
[67:28] sense and know and a lot of it's because
[67:32] I've only thought about this stuff in my
[67:35] head I've never really a verbalized any
[67:37] of it so it's like I can write it down
[67:41] as a a way to
[67:43] really a lock it in but if I I haven't
[67:47] done that yet and I've never discussed
[67:49] it with somebody else this is like this
[67:51] is like as raw as it gets as me just of
[67:56] figuring things out and like that's what
[67:59] conversations are for and we can ask
[68:02] each other things and go back and forth
[68:05] and like having somebody there to to
[68:08] call you out or to be like wait a minute
[68:10] that doesn't make any sense they're like
[68:12] I'm not really sure where you're de with
[68:15] that that's why we we we we really have
[68:18] these conversations to really terrify
[68:21] things I think in in my own mind before
[68:25] this happened I thought I was going to
[68:28] come on and like Express My Views I was
[68:31] going to come on and say like I've got
[68:33] all of this stuff figured out and now
[68:35] I'm going to express it so other people
[68:38] can can can assimilate it themselves but
[68:43] the reality is I I I don't have it all
[68:46] figured out I have very little of it
[68:48] figured out all I do is ask myself
[68:49] things all day long and I ask other
[68:51] people things all day long and I've i'
[68:53] I've enjoyed the
[68:55] conversation because it's been so
[68:57] organic and because I felt a free within
[69:01] this conversation to just be myself and
[69:04] to just not not have the fear of my ego
[69:09] thinking like oh if I don't express the
[69:11] these points the way that Jeff Booth
[69:14] does uh nobody's gonna care or nobody's
[69:17] gonna I'll like this or Robin's not
[69:20] going to like Robin's not going to upst
[69:22] all that stuff I've been free of those
[69:25] thoughts I've just been able to enjoy
[69:28] this moment with you I think that like
[69:30] like having having moments like this is
[69:34] so rare and I think like I I wanted to
[69:38] to to tell you this
[69:40] for a long time you doing a podcast
[69:45] every day for as long as you have is is
[69:50] such a a Monumental am aition and up
[69:56] pulling it off seems impossible and yet
[70:01] you make it look so easy I don't think
[70:03] people understand like how hard it is to
[70:06] to actually like have a podcast every
[70:11] day it would be hard to have an hourlong
[70:15] conversation with a family member in
[70:18] your own home every day for a lot of
[70:22] people you you have hourong going to
[70:26] conversations with people you've never
[70:28] met people you don't know anything about
[70:31] people you've never even interacted with
[70:34] before and you do it every day and you
[70:35] do it consistently that's
[70:39] why I left the comments that I left
[70:43] because I saw this guy is going so hard
[70:46] he deserves the uh the the the algorithm
[70:51] bump or he deserves me me also
[70:55] contributing you inspired me to add more
[70:59] because I see how much you've you've put
[71:02] into it I just want to say like more
[71:04] than anything else I appreciate seeing
[71:08] somebody who says I'm gonna do this
[71:10] thing and then execute it every single
[71:14] day I'm literally having Goosebumps
[71:16] right now thank you it's like
[71:19] wow yeah it's it's actually um I would
[71:23] not say hot uh but it's uh you you learn
[71:27] to adapt because there's so many
[71:29] different people and everyone has a
[71:31] different energy and like some someone
[71:33] comes in like for example n prunell uh
[71:37] and Jeff PO is like always two the two
[71:39] examples I use because everyone knows
[71:41] those two and that prunell is used to
[71:43] like really speaking like a machine gun
[71:46] because she speaks on television a lot
[71:48] she always has like two minutes time to
[71:50] express herself and she's on this
[71:52] pressure like they CNBC and they want to
[71:54] have now an opinion on that specific
[71:56] topic what will Bitcoin do and she has
[71:58] one minute time uh and she's like I I
[72:01] asked her questions she's like and I
[72:04] feel
[72:05] like like I feel like shot from a
[72:09] machine gun uh and then there's the Jeff
[72:12] poof kind of a guy like he's uh sitting
[72:15] back relaxed and and really takes his
[72:18] time with the words and then like really
[72:20] like explains it and and it's like that
[72:24] calm moment
[72:25] with him it's like those completely
[72:28] different persons and there are
[72:32] 25 different uh categories of persons
[72:35] and maybe that are WR my podcast and
[72:38] there's probably like thousands others
[72:40] that have not been interviewing and
[72:42] people like oh it's crazy that you do it
[72:44] uh every day and I'm like I want to do
[72:46] it every day twice like I I enjoy it so
[72:49] much at this point and the only thing I
[72:51] do don't do it more is because uh I have
[72:54] constraints with the uh post production
[72:57] I like once we have done with the
[73:00] podcast I have to figure out how to uh
[73:02] Market that whole thing uh what to do in
[73:05] the description what to do in the title
[73:06] thumbnail uh there's a lot to do it then
[73:09] I get all the quotes out of the podcast
[73:11] uh and I have to put it on all the
[73:13] platforms like there's a lot of uh
[73:16] around things like I spend with you like
[73:18] one two hours recording it uh and then I
[73:21] spend another two three sometimes four
[73:23] hours of of post production
[73:26] working so that's that's the challenge
[73:28] uh the the
[73:29] conversations I always enjoyed them I
[73:31] always was like a very talkative person
[73:35] I was not always that uh uh I was since
[73:39] like 15 16 17 years old I became that
[73:42] person a little bit because I pushed
[73:44] myself out of the comfort zone uh but
[73:46] I'm still really introverted uh you
[73:49] would not guess it uh and uh but if I
[73:52] feel comfortable then I'm getting do
[73:55] like a really extroverted like I if I'm
[73:58] in a party with like 10 people I really
[74:00] like I'm the guy that always screams I'm
[74:02] the guy that always talks talks the
[74:04] whole night I'm really extroverted if
[74:07] I'm with a new crowd I'm more listening
[74:09] I'm really more intro I think probably a
[74:12] lot of people feel that way uh but yeah
[74:15] it's it's it's fascinating to have the
[74:16] podcast every day and thank you for the
[74:18] feedback I really enjoyed
[74:20] it
[74:22] yeah soon enough you're going to have
[74:25] have a a production team you can have a
[74:29] post- production team you have somebody
[74:31] to a book people you'll be paying people
[74:34] to do all the things that are the the
[74:38] constraints of for you and you will be
[74:42] free to just have conversations you'll
[74:45] be free from the the effort of the
[74:50] constraints
[74:51] around the conversations and
[74:55] are free to
[74:57] just talk to people all day
[75:00] long and the only thing that I never
[75:02] want to Outsource is guest booking like
[75:04] uh having making the appointments with
[75:06] guest because I feel like it's first of
[75:09] all that you know it I do it always with
[75:11] a calendar link I send a calendar link
[75:13] out and then you book it uh but I think
[75:17] it's not a good thing like the assistant
[75:20] right hey do that and that there are so
[75:23] many tools that do good job that we
[75:25] don't have to write back and forth with
[75:28] time zones and everything
[75:29] so the guest booking is the one thing
[75:32] that I'm like that's the that's the
[75:34] connection that I want to keep but all
[75:36] the rest like the post production how
[75:38] the trailer looks what quotes to take
[75:41] from that I think it it would even
[75:44] Elevate the the quality because then
[75:48] there's a guy that there's full time uh
[75:51] on how to make the video that the
[75:55] conversation that is there because after
[75:57] the conversation is done I cannot do a
[75:59] better job in the conversation but I can
[76:01] do a better job in uh editing it I can
[76:04] do like a one minute preview that people
[76:07] actually have a nice idea what is in the
[76:09] conversation and then also inside of it
[76:13] uh I can capture like when you say
[76:15] something then the camera cuts to like
[76:17] my uh um reaction because maybe my
[76:20] reaction is in that moment more
[76:22] interesting and that having you on full
[76:24] full Focus like those kind of things
[76:27] like all this I cannot do this now
[76:29] because I don't just don't have the time
[76:31] to do all the that but there are lot of
[76:33] things that would my podcast would
[76:36] benefit from Once I have an another
[76:39] person helping me do you think you're
[76:41] you're away from that no clue um like I
[76:46] see U my podcast is related uh to the
[76:51] Bitcoin price like I see when the
[76:54] Bitcoin price is going up and down
[76:56] either way if it goes up or down it
[76:59] doesn't matter for me but it if it does
[77:01] if the Bitcoin price does something I
[77:03] get way more fuse and with way more fuse
[77:06] more people see it uh and uh I make also
[77:09] more money for example I made more money
[77:11] when I had a thousand
[77:13] subscribers uh because the fs and were
[77:17] up and the the the volatility of Bitcoin
[77:20] were up then I make right now because
[77:22] the price has been like so FL lining for
[77:26] a longer time uh so for example if if
[77:29] the Bitcoin price shoots up in the Q3 Q
[77:32] Q4 it could be extremely interesting how
[77:36] then my podcast do because I leveled up
[77:38] my quality leveled up the library
[77:40] leveled up with my guests and then the
[77:43] price also comes in then I don't know
[77:45] what's possible but yeah I'm just trying
[77:48] to do a great job and enhancing the
[77:50] quality enhancing everything around that
[77:53] and if I'm able to employ a person to
[77:57] help me uh depends on the output uh that
[78:03] uh that I get I can only control the
[78:05] input and and I will put the input in as
[78:08] long as I live I I already said in the
[78:11] podcast I will do the podcast till I die
[78:13] uh because I love it uh if I cannot do
[78:16] it uh as a profession at some point
[78:18] because of whatever reason I will just
[78:21] do it once a week and and do less of
[78:23] them because then I'm time constraint
[78:26] but I would love to do it as as much as
[78:28] I as I do it so I will I will always do
[78:31] it at Le at least
[78:33] interesting that's interesting because I
[78:36] don't think we they've ever had uh they
[78:39] haven't had a
[78:40] podcaster uh through their whole life
[78:44] through the their podcast yet like I
[78:47] know Rogan is like a 55 right now I
[78:51] always ask myself like is he still GNA
[78:53] be doing this when he's like
[78:55] 75 and and he does it since a long time
[78:58] he does it 15 years already yeah and he
[79:01] is staring 15 years and on average 3.4
[79:05] episodes per week so he's done a lot of
[79:10] episodes uh but yeah it would be really
[79:12] interesting to see like I start at 25
[79:15] and I'm doing like till 95 but yeah I
[79:17] also have to do it let's see if I
[79:20] actually can hold my my word sorry I
[79:23] interrupted you no no no no it's fine
[79:25] I'm I'm excited to see what happens I
[79:28] think this all so new podcasting as
[79:33] a career is is
[79:37] new we you know 20 years ago the there
[79:40] weren't any uh three year podcasting
[79:43] jobs you know but but but now it seems
[79:46] like it could be a lifelong career for
[79:51] for uh for people who do it at a high
[79:54] level
[79:55] and I'm just
[79:56] I'm uh curious to see what happens with
[80:00] that curious to see old men podcasting
[80:03] more than anything I think uh yes I also
[80:06] think that elderly people like I'm
[80:10] talking like 65 70 80 years old even I
[80:15] think they should get more in front of
[80:16] camera and speak because they have such
[80:19] like I'm 25 year old my I I've not lived
[80:23] anything like I've lived something thing
[80:25] but compared to a 80y old man I've not
[80:29] done any experience at this point like
[80:31] they have so much more experience they
[80:33] have so much more wisdom so for them to
[80:35] do a podcast that would be great and I
[80:38] would love to see that uh and it's also
[80:41] interesting I I've I see the the the
[80:44] statistics how old my viewers are and I
[80:49] actually have 12% of my viewers of 65 uh
[80:53] and plus like 65 years old and above
[80:58] that uh 12% of my viewers which is
[81:01] amazing that they're like open and
[81:03] listening regularly to like a 25y old
[81:06] guy that just starts out and have no
[81:08] clue about the
[81:09] life yeah I think those are the early
[81:12] adopters for sure those are the
[81:14] open-minded older people who who have
[81:17] always thought that they could learn
[81:19] from everybody that's for sure that's
[81:21] for sure um as we're now at the already
[81:25] uh more of the the the
[81:27] record record timing in the podcast I
[81:30] think I have done one podcast that was
[81:32] over two hours uh it was a very long
[81:36] podcast um let's come to the end routine
[81:38] there's the outine is now consisting of
[81:41] two questions the first question is like
[81:43] what are you currently passionate about
[81:45] besides Bitcoin besides Bitcoin uh what
[81:48] are you deeply learning and and
[81:49] passionate about you know what it is
[81:52] it's so weird because I never been a
[81:56] Frugal individual I've always sort of
[81:59] just I've I've always made not always
[82:01] but for
[82:03] about 10 years I've had a a a somewhat
[82:07] High income um and I've been able to
[82:10] just kind of like uh afford things and I
[82:14] never really thought about budgeting
[82:16] before I just sort of
[82:19] like lived my life and thought whatever
[82:22] I I wanted and you know tried to save
[82:25] money and tried to invest some things on
[82:27] the side but I think since I got like L
[82:32] into Bitcoin I've become so a Frugal and
[82:38] so a minimalistic and I've really like
[82:42] asked myself all the time is this
[82:45] valuable is this the thing that I need
[82:48] right now and and and uh I've just
[82:51] really uh I know it sounds you know
[82:54] maybe sounds kind of a lame but like I'm
[82:58] passionate about not throwing value away
[83:02] on
[83:03] nonsense and I've really become very
[83:06] arugal
[83:08] and un minimalistic and as a result I've
[83:11] just been I've just been stacking SS man
[83:15] and that's where my real passion is
[83:17] right now I love it so much uh and we
[83:20] also have the end routine where the
[83:22] previous guest is asking a question for
[83:24] the next guest without knowing who the
[83:26] next guest is uh and the the it's a it's
[83:30] a profound question where we can like
[83:32] literally talk an hour more
[83:35] but why why is Bitcoin uh creating a
[83:39] better
[83:40] world oh that's so you know that's not
[83:43] fair to ask ask that question at the end
[83:46] of the podcast we can go another hour
[83:49] and a half easily why is it creating a
[83:53] better world
[83:55] very simply because it it
[83:59] forces honesty forces Integrity honesty
[84:03] because it's a a Truth uh it's truth
[84:07] money I heard that uh expression of a
[84:10] lot it's it's it's a it's a great answer
[84:12] yeah and it's it's also great because I
[84:15] think actually we could make a whole
[84:17] podcast around that topic so I think we
[84:20] we should keep it as short as as it is
[84:22] now perfect
[84:24] uh per yeah perfect and thank you Eddie
[84:27] for for being on um before I let you go
[84:30] uh where can people like find you and
[84:32] ask questions do you have like an an
[84:35] handle or somewhere where people can
[84:37] reach you
[84:39] no I'm not
[84:42] available I might be in
[84:44] your a YouTube comments but that's about
[84:47] it perfect and when people want to to
[84:51] ask you questions they should see my
[84:53] videos uh and and see in the comments if
[84:55] there is a some on beef in
[84:58] there I'll be I'm lurking around the the
[85:02] comments and uh as I always am perfect
[85:06] and yeah thank you uh and I definitely I
[85:10] think if if people want to ask you
[85:12] questions if people want to do that they
[85:13] can do it in this podcast in that
[85:15] comment section and I guess you will be
[85:18] in the in the comment section and and
[85:20] and and uh answering questions if
[85:22] someone actually has uh questions in
[85:24] there for you and that's I think it's
[85:26] it's a good good way to to do that and
[85:29] yeah thank you for being on and thank
[85:31] you everyone for watching I'll be back
[85:33] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
