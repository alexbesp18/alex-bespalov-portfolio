[00:00] the government ended up really
[00:01] destroying houses the government just
[00:03] comes and says you know what this is our
[00:05] land so imagine you've invested so much
[00:08] in property in land and uh it's just
[00:10] destroyed everything can taken away from
[00:13] you except Bitcoin we see a near future
[00:15] where bers have to be worried about
[00:17] their safety if you work in the Fiat
[00:20] system you should uh be looking for a
[00:22] way out why not use Bitcoin why not use
[00:25] lightning why don't use all the amazing
[00:28] systems that someone just put out and it
[00:31] is there it will not go away all the
[00:33] banking system they clinking on on their
[00:35] power and they want to stay in power and
[00:38] they want to have those fear rails what
[00:40] is your price prediction for 2024 oh
[00:43] I'll go with the highest 1 million
[00:47] do I've not done a recording in a while
[00:50] yeah I saw your videos they're really
[00:51] good I like them thank you thank you
[00:53] thank
[00:54] you you're from Kenya right yes I am
[00:57] from Kenya at the coast of Kenya oh very
[01:01] cool I never visited Africa so I I have
[01:04] no clue uh how the Bitcoin adoption is
[01:08] there like it's growing it's really
[01:10] growing we were left far off behind I
[01:13] guess after the scums came but right now
[01:15] it's really really growing um it serves
[01:18] us quite well yeah very cool so then uh
[01:24] I would just say uh we we start right
[01:27] into it right okay yeah where where are
[01:29] you from yourself uh Austria oh Austria
[01:34] wow that's why I was like I hear German
[01:36] word it's
[01:38] like I wish I understood German but
[01:42] there are lots of Germans in Kenya um at
[01:45] the co Kenya yeah at the coast of Kenya
[01:48] um around the the diani areas the
[01:52] coastal beaches there's are very many
[01:54] Germans there that live there oh and and
[01:57] why do you want to have uh learn German
[02:01] like why do you want to uh know it
[02:03] German is quite difficult I I I tried
[02:06] understanding it um it's related to
[02:09] English
[02:12] words yeah uh I have a girlfriend that
[02:17] is not speaking uh German so I speak
[02:20] mostly English with her uh even though
[02:23] my native language is German but she's
[02:26] learning German every day uh and through
[02:30] her I understand now how how hard it is
[02:33] to learn German like it's it's not an
[02:36] easy language it's like the does there
[02:38] are like so many um so many weird cases
[02:43] where English is just so much easier and
[02:46] it's like you don't you have like you
[02:49] really have to want to learn it really
[02:52] hard like there has to be some love
[02:54] reason for it that has to be like oh you
[02:56] you want to live in the country maybe
[02:58] then that's it's possible but even even
[03:00] living even if you live in
[03:02] Austria uh you don't need German that
[03:07] much like you can do everything
[03:09] basically in English so
[03:14] there's yeah and the in so when there
[03:17] are a lot of English speakers the
[03:18] incentive to learn the local language is
[03:20] slow so some just don't do it so that's
[03:25] that's
[03:26] something what's that time there I was
[03:29] worried about the lighting CU it's
[03:30] around 700 p.m. here oh you lighted very
[03:34] very well I I had guests on that were
[03:36] completely dark like that you could not
[03:39] even see it
[03:41] nicely I I can see you very good okay
[03:46] great so how did you get uh started with
[03:49] Bitcoin uh in your
[03:51] journey um so I I live at the coast of
[03:54] Kenya
[03:56] um okay first I heard about it in 2015
[03:59] when when I was a student but I really
[04:01] didn't interact with it as most people
[04:04] usually do you just hear about it and
[04:05] you ignore it and um with time I I
[04:11] learned now about it later when uh there
[04:13] was because I live at the coast there's
[04:14] lots of Tourism there was a tourist was
[04:16] traveling on crypto at the time and uh
[04:19] yeah they they showed me um how trading
[04:22] works and um I had a background in
[04:25] finance so it was easy to like
[04:27] understand wow this uh Bitcoin actually
[04:29] solves most of the problems that we're
[04:31] undergoing in Africa especially in terms
[04:33] of
[04:34] remitance so um yeah it's been a
[04:37] wonderful Journey ever since you know if
[04:40] you can see yeah it's it's it's it's
[04:43] beautiful to see what Bitcoin can do for
[04:45] for people giving them hope and and and
[04:47] properly right and you said it so
[04:50] beautiful in in one of the videos where
[04:52] you said like only a slave can work with
[04:54] no right to the product of his own
[04:57] efforts I even have had to write it down
[04:59] to uh uh to have the right sentence that
[05:03] you said in in the video how does this
[05:05] connect like the property rights what
[05:07] what was the interesting thing for you
[05:10] regarding property rights Bitcoin and
[05:13] and maybe also uh your your experience
[05:17] in life what what teach you
[05:20] everything okay so um what I can say
[05:23] maybe um in terms of property rights
[05:25] maybe if I can tell you so I in Kenya
[05:28] recently something um happened um most
[05:31] people when they decide to invest they
[05:33] Venture in real estate and land is a
[05:36] favorite everybody goes to land because
[05:39] of the speculation um so most people buy
[05:42] land expected to increase in value and
[05:45] then sell it and um the government ended
[05:48] up really destroying houses of people
[05:51] people who had buil houses um for that
[05:54] stayed there for like a couple of years
[05:55] and the government just comes and says
[05:57] you know what this is our land so so
[05:59] imagine you've invested so much um in in
[06:03] property in land and uh it's just
[06:06] destroyed so and this is a very common
[06:08] occurrence businesses are usually taken
[06:11] so in Africa in terms of property rights
[06:13] I can tell you for sure um if you go
[06:16] against the government um most likely
[06:18] you will lose and uh it will be taken
[06:21] away from you and that's even besides
[06:23] talking about how inflation is is theft
[06:25] because um I wanted to talk to to look
[06:28] at like what people value as the best
[06:31] asset so I I looked at I wanted to
[06:33] relate it to some something that people
[06:34] can can understand um land is very
[06:38] avilable property here and uh yeah I'm
[06:41] glad you even watch the video um I hope
[06:44] I'm I'm trying to make the information
[06:45] relatable to people um because um
[06:49] understanding of Bitcoin here in terms
[06:50] of inflation especially when people
[06:53] don't even understand the financial
[06:54] system it's it's a bit difficult so I
[06:57] I'm trying to piece out ways in which it
[06:59] can be relatable so um in terms of my
[07:02] experience um uh when the financial
[07:05] crisis occurred in 2008 uh we ended up
[07:08] uh losing um in terms of the family it
[07:11] the raple effect really touched me in
[07:13] terms of family and uh I think since
[07:16] then I understood you know what you can
[07:17] be able to get money and it can be taken
[07:20] away from you uh property also it can be
[07:22] taken away from you and I just ventured
[07:25] to understanding what are the ways to
[07:28] safeguard your property um especially
[07:30] over a long period of time and um
[07:34] unfortunately it has to be against the
[07:36] bankers and
[07:37] governments yeah everything that that's
[07:40] a in fact that not a lot of people seem
[07:42] to understand everything can take away
[07:45] from you except Bitcoin I mean in hard
[07:48] cases even Bitcoin can take can be taken
[07:50] away from you if they really go the the
[07:52] torturing way and torture the the
[07:55] private keys out of you but like leave
[07:57] that edge case uh out like the land is
[08:01] so easy to take away from you it's just
[08:03] like when the judge says uh oh give the
[08:06] land here or give the land or we put you
[08:10] in prison like you will give the land uh
[08:13] if someone says oh give us the gold bar
[08:15] you have there in your hands give it or
[08:17] you're in the prison like it's so easy
[08:19] and with Bitcoin it's the first property
[08:22] uh they can put you in
[08:24] prison uh still they can shoot you they
[08:26] can do anything with you but you can
[08:29] keep your keys in your head and you
[08:31] don't have to give it to someone even
[08:34] even I go to the extreme example where
[08:36] when someone approaches you and says
[08:38] like with the gun give me your Bitcoin
[08:40] they can still shoot you like Bitcoin is
[08:41] not protecting you from
[08:43] shooting cases well that's has already
[08:46] happened I I don't know I hope not um
[08:49] because I read somewhere I read an
[08:51] article where they were talking about
[08:53] will we see a near future where
[08:54] bitcoiners have to be worried about
[08:56] their sa their safety so that's uh it's
[08:59] quite something privacy is important uh
[09:01] like where are you on the Privacy side
[09:04] with like KC and with like how do you
[09:07] buy a Bitcoin how do you store it what's
[09:10] your uh what's your take on the Privacy
[09:13] side of of Bitcoin okay um in terms of
[09:16] privacy of course um I learn self-
[09:19] custody um from the very ongo um I keep
[09:24] my private keys I especially for
[09:27] long-term savings but uh the company I
[09:29] work with it's a lightning company
[09:31] called machura that is a custodial um
[09:34] lightning wallet so with that we just um
[09:38] I encourage people to if you want to
[09:39] move around cash especially with high
[09:41] fees because there's not in Africa we're
[09:44] not moving too much high value um in
[09:46] terms of Bitcoin so for the for the
[09:48] small cash it's preferable to just use
[09:51] lightning um most definitely um yeah I
[09:55] heard Maring Kura uh already I had a
[09:58] guest on that mentioned it um it's like
[10:01] a service where you can also buy Bitcoin
[10:04] without internet connection right is
[10:06] that
[10:07] the um not not necessarily without
[10:09] internet connection but we just
[10:11] integrated um a service called digits
[10:14] Africa so um you ask me why I buy my
[10:17] Bitcoin um that's that's definitely it
[10:20] for now but um I'm more of I don't even
[10:23] own any more yet I earn in Bitcoin
[10:27] instead um working for the for the
[10:30] company but um yeah we integrated a
[10:33] service where we understand there are
[10:35] people who would like to to buy Bitcoin
[10:37] so the service is called digits Africa
[10:39] and uh with it you can be able to just
[10:42] uh use mobile money to purchase Bitcoin
[10:46] um NE necessarily you don't really have
[10:48] to have internet connection because it's
[10:50] on a web platform but if you want to buy
[10:52] it for someone who does not have
[10:54] internet connection it's quite easy you
[10:56] can just um ke the details and all they
[10:59] have to do is just put in their mobile
[11:00] money pin and once you receive the
[11:03] details um of the ASCO voucher we are
[11:05] partnered with ASCO you can be able to
[11:07] redeem it onto your machura wallet so
[11:10] with that even those who are not Tech
[11:13] savy especially can still be able to um
[11:16] buy
[11:17] Bitcoin um I just thought about it
[11:20] because it's all all over the Twitter
[11:22] news now the Bitcoin
[11:25] ETF um probably when the uh podcast
[11:29] comes out uh the Bitcoin spotf in
[11:32] America will be approved already uh how
[11:35] do
[11:36] you I I I think but like it could be
[11:40] also not let's see maybe it gets
[11:41] approved while we
[11:43] speaking um like how do you see the
[11:46] Bitcoin spot ETF
[11:49] um
[11:50] influencing Bitcoin influencing the
[11:53] market uh or you don't care at all about
[11:57] the
[11:57] Bitcoin uh um it will be it will I
[12:01] cannot say I do not care um of course
[12:03] it's a very um notable um event first of
[12:07] all because you don't understand the
[12:08] kind of demand that you be getting into
[12:10] Bitcoin and um because I'll just tell
[12:13] you my interests and in are in Africa
[12:16] and um I don't want it to get to a point
[12:18] whereby lots of Africans cannot be able
[12:20] to I would love for it to be approved
[12:22] soon I maybe for for the marketing
[12:26] because I've seen there's a lot of
[12:27] marketing coming into it but for the
[12:30] price increase I feel I'll have now a
[12:33] lot of work convincing people to get to
[12:36] uh get into Bitcoin when the prices are
[12:38] quite high so um but still I'm excited
[12:42] about it I'm looking forward to seeing
[12:43] the demand that gets into it and uh yeah
[12:48] I think we have to switch to like a
[12:50] satos satosi default uh because I think
[12:54] in a lot of people's head when the price
[12:56] of one Bitcoin is like 250 th000 or
[13:00] dollars it's like wow it's so expensive
[13:03] I can never afford it but they don't
[13:04] realize that there's like a small amount
[13:07] you can also buy you can buy like just
[13:09] two Sates basically about that that's
[13:13] quite interesting because um in Uganda
[13:15] the Uganda Shilling already reached
[13:18] Satoshi parity so a while back you could
[13:20] be able to buy one s for and you got a
[13:24] shilling oh so like the parative of the
[13:27] Uganda currency already dropped to the
[13:31] onei mark yeah yeah and I think this
[13:35] will happen with every currency honestly
[13:38] with the Euro with the dollar with all
[13:40] the currency everything will drop to
[13:43] onei and Below because do you do you
[13:45] think that Fiat can survive like the
[13:47] Fiat uh Financial system can they
[13:50] survive the next let's say 50
[13:53] years um I I feel if you work in the
[13:56] Fiat system you should be looking for a
[13:59] way out um I I want to say I want I'll
[14:05] see it's surviving but most of the
[14:07] systems that are in the bank I feel
[14:09] they're outdated and they do not work
[14:11] for the benefit of most people that
[14:14] require the banking
[14:16] system
[14:17] um if I can uh put an example especially
[14:21] with remittance uh the remittance sector
[14:25] um in the banking system I do not see
[14:30] lasting long I I can't speak for the
[14:32] Western um side but in Africa it has not
[14:36] really served us quite a lot we receive
[14:38] a lot of remittance um Nigeria receives
[14:41] lots of remittance Kenya most of our of
[14:45] of the money coming into the country is
[14:47] through remittance people are walking
[14:49] abroad and sending money into the
[14:50] country and if the systems are not put
[14:53] in place to ensure that this process is
[14:57] it's fast and at least affordable for
[15:00] majority of the population people will
[15:01] look for Alternatives and um it would be
[15:04] better if they worked towards um serving
[15:08] uh people it's it's it's sad that I can
[15:12] imagine having to fight for a system
[15:15] that's serving you
[15:16] but I think people would definitely go
[15:19] for the better option that will serve
[15:22] them and right now I see that Bitcoin
[15:24] can be able to do that lightning can be
[15:26] able to to do that it's way better like
[15:29] even in the western western hemisphere
[15:32] let's say um like if you want to
[15:36] transfer um small amounts of money or
[15:39] even big amounts of money it's so much
[15:42] paperwork it's so much legal things
[15:45] there's so much um fees going on and as
[15:50] a settlement layer Bitcoin even the main
[15:52] chain
[15:54] has lower fees uh than than some of the
[15:58] like if if you want to send uh 20,000
[16:02] across country borders it's better on
[16:05] the base chain of Bitcoin and more
[16:08] efficient
[16:10] faster and and and and just like even
[16:13] even uh even lower fees and that's like
[16:18] uh why not use Bitcoin why not use
[16:21] lightning why not use all the amazing
[16:23] systems that someone just put out and it
[16:27] is there it will not go away and this is
[16:30] a system that does not require any
[16:33] additional work and all the banking
[16:35] system they uh clinking on on their
[16:38] power and they want to stay in power and
[16:40] they want to have those fear rails and
[16:42] just
[16:44] uh it's it's a sad thing I think for for
[16:48] for a lot of people that like if someone
[16:51] wants to send um money back home to
[16:54] their original country and then there
[16:56] are those the the Western Union
[16:59] of the world taking like a 20% 10% 30%
[17:03] cut of the whole thing uh for basically
[17:05] making an entry in a database that's
[17:08] that's just not fair I think yeah
[17:10] exactly um and um at least for you have
[17:15] just the fee thing um currently in Kenya
[17:19] I've okay in my lifetime I've already
[17:21] seen two Banks
[17:23] collapse um and with people's savings
[17:27] and even besides that with Investments
[17:30] we have people losing invest investment
[17:33] money um investing in things like Sues
[17:37] and uh right now even have the
[17:38] government coming for your savings in
[17:41] circles they're like uh now we want to
[17:44] tax your savings so um there's a lot of
[17:47] things that Bitcoin can
[17:49] solve for us
[17:52] um
[17:53] taxing they're taxing your savings like
[17:56] you have Savings in your bank and they
[17:59] they want part of that or what yes and
[18:01] Cooperative societies if um I'm not sure
[18:04] that you've you have that we have more
[18:07] Cooperative societies where people save
[18:09] for example if you're in a company you
[18:11] decide to save in um a Cooperative with
[18:13] a company and that also wants to be
[18:17] taxed so uh you imagine I have to work
[18:21] get taxed I go to save and it gets St so
[18:24] we're living at a point where uh life is
[18:27] getting really difficult for majority of
[18:29] the population especially if you don't
[18:31] understand how the financial system
[18:33] works you can end up leaving blaming the
[18:36] government day in day out but um it is
[18:40] what it is and a way out is all we're
[18:43] left with to be honest yeah I think and
[18:47] a lot of people in like Austria and
[18:49] Western countries I think they're really
[18:51] arrogant and they don't think those Bank
[18:54] collapses on those um taxes and those
[18:59] getting uh attacking property rights are
[19:02] not coming to to Austria for example I
[19:05] think there a lot of arrogant people are
[19:07] saying like no no it's it's a thing of
[19:09] other countries and I'm like no this
[19:11] will come to every country it's just a
[19:13] matter of time like we we might have a
[19:16] little Advantage now but this if we're
[19:19] not taking Bitcoin seriously right now
[19:22] uh someone else will as we see with El
[19:24] Salvador as we see with other countries
[19:27] that are adop
[19:28] Bitcoin faster than uh Europe especially
[19:33] Europe with so many regulations and so
[19:35] many uh challenges they're like they
[19:37] just they just want to ban themselves
[19:40] from Bitcoin and they're not realizing
[19:42] that Bitcoin is the thing they have to
[19:44] embrace
[19:45] and and is it also for in in Africa and
[19:49] Kenya um how is the government seeing
[19:52] Bitcoin there okay so um it varies in
[19:55] different African countries so um maybe
[19:58] I can start with like the extremes I've
[20:00] seen um places like
[20:02] Uganda um the the in terms of the
[20:06] regulation the government still hasn't
[20:08] uplifted like um there was a there was a
[20:11] memo put out by the central bank that
[20:14] cryptocurrencies are a no no no Bitcoin
[20:16] is a no um but for Kenya I can say that
[20:21] they're open to it but they're open to
[20:23] it in terms of Taxation so they've not
[20:26] legalized it as legal tender but yeah
[20:28] they're open to taxing it Nigeria is
[20:30] impressive recently we saw that they um
[20:34] uplifted the there was a ban that has
[20:37] recently been uplifted so for Nigeria um
[20:40] and it's it's good because I I see that
[20:43] Nigeria being the largest economy in
[20:45] Africa uh people tend to other countries
[20:48] tend to follow what it does so that's a
[20:50] good step the the central bank has made
[20:53] so we're going to see more countries
[20:55] hopefully take it up in Africa so I
[20:57] think the narrative is
[20:59] changing um even though most leaders
[21:02] don't want to listen about it they do
[21:05] know people use it so I guess with time
[21:08] we'll just see it embracing it because
[21:10] um to be honest it's not just serving um
[21:13] the people it's really beneficial even
[21:15] to to governments in Africa so yeah um
[21:20] in terms of Regulation I'm I've seen
[21:23] more positive news of late I'm hoping to
[21:26] just seeing it get more positive yeah
[21:30] it's it's it's um you cannot uh ban or
[21:35] stop Bitcoin like you you can't just uh
[21:38] stop yourself of getting more Bitcoin
[21:40] and this this whole game fa will play
[21:43] out it's it's it's already started uh we
[21:46] seeing now with the Bitcoin ETF we
[21:48] seeing it with El Salvador we saw it
[21:50] with micro strategy we saw it with so
[21:53] many adoption stories where there are a
[21:57] successful people that adopted and all
[22:00] the other people that did not do the
[22:02] decision and also thought about it
[22:04] they're like hm they did it and they're
[22:06] now really really good off they will
[22:09] look at all the other people that did it
[22:11] and will do it eventually we saw it I
[22:14] think the best example is still micro
[22:16] strategy is the first publicly traded
[22:18] company that buys Bitcoin now they are
[22:21] like 80 publicly traded companies that
[22:24] have bought Bitcoin so it it needs
[22:29] someone to stand up and then there will
[22:33] be brave people behind them and follow
[22:36] and you know the meme where like all uh
[22:40] the people are like slaves in front of
[22:43] the government and then there's like the
[22:45] next scene where s Nakamoto stood up and
[22:48] behind him more and more people stand up
[22:50] and all of the sudden it's like the
[22:51] government Bing to the people and we are
[22:54] seeing a power shift
[22:56] definitely I'm worried about the ETFs uh
[23:00] though um I hope we can spread the
[23:04] message that it's better for people to
[23:06] hold Bitcoin inside of the atfs but we
[23:08] really can't prevent that because right
[23:10] now we'll have yes it's it's good the
[23:13] institutional demand is coming in but um
[23:16] at what level are they coming in so yeah
[23:19] that that will be interesting to watch I
[23:21] guess there's a lot of uncertainty no
[23:23] one really knows where this is heading
[23:25] we'll just have to wait and see how it
[23:27] pens out
[23:29] yeah this is a really important uh
[23:31] message to get out like the Bitcoin ETF
[23:33] itself it's a complete product
[23:37] like never buy the Bitcoin
[23:40] ETF people buy it yes people buy it but
[23:45] uh it just like for me it's Wall Street
[23:49] giving up and recognizing Bitcoin that
[23:52] that's what the Bitcoin ETF basically is
[23:55] like as as we said before with the
[23:57] Bowing it's like Bitcoin is here and all
[24:00] of the sudden wall stre is like oh yes
[24:02]  you're right we also need that that
[24:05] Bitcoin and I don't know what they're
[24:07] trying maybe they try a fork maybe they
[24:10] try some some Federal Reserve thing uh
[24:14] with with Bitcoin maybe they try some
[24:16] stupid stuff but at the end of the day
[24:18] if Bitcoin is actually as we all think
[24:21] sound money it can handle the ETF it can
[24:24] handle so much more and we just have to
[24:28] keep uh educating people and spread the
[24:30] message and self custody our Bitcoin and
[24:33] uh that's why I also contacted you
[24:35] because you're doing uh a lot of uh
[24:37] great work you're like I think also
[24:40] translating uh Bitcoin education like
[24:43] you you're really doing a great job
[24:46] thank you very much yes um I'm I'm
[24:47] working with a company called exonumia
[24:50] um the the first thing we
[24:52] noticed um when okay the first thing of
[24:54] course you notice when you get into the
[24:56] Bitcoin space ch in Africa we have um
[25:00] lots of people who do not speak in
[25:02] English um for example if I can just uh
[25:07] IED something on the stats of the
[25:09] languages that uh are spoken in Africa
[25:12] Swahili has 200 million speakers and uh
[25:15] in fact for the rural
[25:17] areas relating Bitcoin in terms of
[25:20] English can be quite the challenge so uh
[25:24] there's a project called exonia still
[25:26] with the same founder I work with
[25:28] machura and uh we are carrying out open
[25:31] source translation of a Bitcoin book so
[25:34] and uh currently I'm still working on
[25:36] another one um it will be a
[25:39] surprise the next book that that's
[25:41] coming out I'm really excited about it
[25:43] I've been looking forward to translating
[25:44] uh this book so uh be on the lookout
[25:47] Robin but looking forward it yeah and uh
[25:51] it's it's the reception has been quite
[25:52] well actually um I even had people tell
[25:55] me they are reading the books in Congo
[25:59] and um it's it's been it's been amazing
[26:01] to see just how much impact we can be
[26:04] able to have if we can be able to get um
[26:07] Bitcoin literature in other languages
[26:11] especially African languages for sure
[26:14] yeah that's a that's an amazing thing
[26:17] you're doing to help spread the Bitcoin
[26:21] where it's most needed for the people
[26:24] that don't even know English they cannot
[26:28] uh read all those great books from like
[26:31] cerine from all the great Bitcoin offers
[26:34] that's really great word what else are
[26:36] you doing in in Bitcoin right now um I
[26:40] also just do the podcasts but um I'm
[26:43] with Bitcoin layer um I don't know
[26:45] whether you've seen a few of the videos
[26:46] here uh so I I work with the team Nick
[26:50] baa of the Bitcoin layer Joe so it's
[26:54] more of just education and majorly I can
[26:58] say it's um um adoption through
[27:01] especially machura if we I do most of on
[27:05] boardings um and uh right now that we
[27:08] have the digits Africa in also the
[27:11] buying um as you can see Robin there's a
[27:13] lot of work to be done in Africa in
[27:16] terms of Bitcoin I
[27:18] encourage um those who want to uh work
[27:22] on you know Bitcoin adoption spread in
[27:24] Africa there's a lot of opportunities
[27:27] I've just touch on the bare minimum
[27:29] there's a lot of Education going on
[27:31] Bitcoin mining if you're if you're
[27:33] really a fan of it um there's a company
[27:35] called
[27:36] gridless um that is in is in
[27:39] Kenya and uh also it's in Zambia Malawi
[27:44] they are carrying out Bitcoin mining
[27:46] using um Hydro micro GDs and it's
[27:49] they're doing it in the rural areas
[27:50] where people can't have able to afford
[27:52] power so that's also a game Cher in
[27:56] terms of uh distrib bution of
[27:57] electricity in the continent especially
[28:00] since most parts of the continent don't
[28:02] have electricity I I really appreciate
[28:05] what what you're doing for Bitcoin and
[28:07] what you are doing uh for basically uh
[28:11] Humanity I think you already made a
[28:13] video also where I don't remember the
[28:16] name the first African woman that got
[28:19] the Nobel Prize for
[28:21] Peace you through the connection with
[28:25] her and human humanit
[28:28] and uh Bitcoin like maybe talk a little
[28:31] bit about that what you what you uh
[28:34] learn from that video ah okay yes um I
[28:38] happen to to attend or rather not even
[28:41] attend if you look at a country like
[28:44] let's say Togo um I I'll talk about this
[28:48] because I don't know you've heard about
[28:49] there's a lady called farida nabura uh
[28:51] she's doing um amazing work in terms of
[28:54] Bitcoin adoption there she's a human
[28:55] rights activist and uh there's a lot of
[28:58] human rights violation in Africa in um a
[29:01] lot of places not just in terms of the
[29:03] economy and uh yeah I I was just looking
[29:07] at the connection between human rights
[29:08] and how Bitcoin can be able to to be
[29:12] able to solve the issues AAL of Human
[29:15] Rights activists some of them are exiled
[29:17] from their countries she's a she's an
[29:19] example and uh right now human rights
[29:22] activists can be able to receive money
[29:24] anywhere in the world without having to
[29:26] S back Mission without having to have
[29:28] their bank accounts closed and um we are
[29:31] going to see a lot of change in the
[29:34] world if I if I give another
[29:36] example um erria for example Ethiopia
[29:40] there's also um another wonderful lady
[29:43] working there myON estefanos for her we
[29:47] have there um refugees trying to escape
[29:51] erria and they use the route that uh
[29:53] goes all the way trying to get into
[29:55] Europe so and some of them end up
[29:58] getting kidnapped and they require
[29:59] Ransom and right now they can be able to
[30:02] receive Ransom using Bitcoin um
[30:06] sometimes you you have to leave your
[30:07] country and you don't have any property
[30:10] right now you can even have them leave
[30:12] with with the Bitcoin so we're going to
[30:14] see a lot of changes not just in terms
[30:16] of how um Africa is run um economically
[30:21] but also in terms of the political
[30:22] frontally human rights VI
[30:25] violations um I feel we can be ble to
[30:27] get in touch because most of them money
[30:29] is a key factor um and uh and Bitcoin is
[30:34] going to come in for for a lot of these
[30:37] cases for
[30:38] sure yeah that's uh I think Alex gladin
[30:42] also makes a lot of uh work in in that
[30:45] area and it's it's fascinating to to see
[30:48] all the bitcoiners are uh helping
[30:52] Humanity Prosper like that's it's a
[30:55] great thing um we we are having an an
[30:58] end routine in the podcast the next
[31:01] guest uh question without knowing what's
[31:03] the next who's the next guest and the
[31:06] question is an an interesting one and
[31:10] and and an question that is impossible
[31:13] to
[31:14] answer it's what is what is your price
[31:18] prediction for 2024 like end of
[31:23] 20124 I'll go with the highest 1 million
[31:26] dollar
[31:29] the prediction I've seen most people
[31:31] have um I don't usually talk about the
[31:35] price for me actually I was saying if
[31:37] you earn in Bitcoin the price going up
[31:40] it's not a very happy moment because you
[31:42] want to get more
[31:44] sets but uh yeah but the the highest
[31:49] that I've seen the prediction $1 million
[31:51] for sure yeah a lot of people don't get
[31:53] it like I also don't like higher prices
[31:56] because I I'm like I'm young now yeah
[32:00] I'm earning now and I want as much SS as
[32:03] I possibly can and this high prices are
[32:08] making it really really difficult for me
[32:11] so I don't like the high prices I don't
[32:14] like that the ETF is coming now I want
[32:16] the ETF to come in
[32:20] 2020 the I Gary I think he shares the
[32:24] same sentiments um I feel he shares same
[32:27] sentiments he's also trying to stop this
[32:29] as much as as as he can for
[32:32] sure yes he is uh I don't know what his
[32:37] true intentions are because I think he
[32:39] is really understanding what Bitcoin is
[32:42] uh he has an MIT uh lecture that's uh
[32:46] publicly available on YouTube where you
[32:49] can just see and listen to him and you
[32:51] know this guy understands Bitcoin on a
[32:54] technical level uh he has the capability
[32:58] to understand it on an economical level
[33:01] yes on a financial level
[33:04] so let let's see how it pans out like
[33:07] what do you thought yesterday did you
[33:09] saw that Bitcoin like the bitcoin's body
[33:13] was approved and died like three minutes
[33:16] later I woke up because it happened um
[33:19] while we were still asleep so I wake up
[33:21] early in the morning and I'm seeing wow
[33:23] we shot all the way up up to almost
[33:26] 48,000 and then just went down and of
[33:29] course you have to check um the internet
[33:32] um I think they're playing games now and
[33:36] but it doesn't really matter for hardit
[33:38] coiners we know the game here is stck SS
[33:42] and really just don't pay attention to
[33:44] whatever is going on and uh encourage
[33:47] adoption get more people in um before
[33:50] the
[33:51] institutions really get in with a big
[33:53] money that is the most important message
[33:57] like whatever happens with the Haring
[34:00] with Bitcoin spotf with Gary with an SSC
[34:04] account that gets hacked
[34:07] apparently like no no matter what
[34:09] happens just stack stay humble uh keep
[34:13] your Bitcoin in self custody and do do
[34:16] do the hard work of holding on to your
[34:20] Bitcoin as hard as you possibly can and
[34:24] if you're doing that you will be
[34:27] fine uh and if you additionally do do
[34:32] that and also contribute to a better
[34:35] Society better uh better Humanity I
[34:38] think you will be you will be fine and
[34:40] you you will have a great life so uh um
