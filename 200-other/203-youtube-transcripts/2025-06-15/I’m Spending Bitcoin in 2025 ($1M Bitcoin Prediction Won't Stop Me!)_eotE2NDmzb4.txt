[00:00] a lot of people are afraid to spend it
[00:02] which is fine because we're we're still
[00:03] in these early days of volatility and
[00:06] the price still growing and growing and
[00:09] these predictions of1 million And1
[00:10] million valuations just make people
[00:13] really hold it I still spend Bitcoin I
[00:15] use it as a business if you're now
[00:17] comfortable holding Bitcoin in your
[00:19] treasury then you're going to start to
[00:21] want to accumulate more Bitcoin which I
[00:23] think then we start to see businesses
[00:25] you know adopting Bitcoin as a medium of
[00:28] exchange unfortunately you know micro
[00:30] strategy doesn't even do this you know
[00:31] like they have half a million Bitcoin
[00:33] and you know you can't even buy their
[00:34] swag with Bitcoin if we go back to what
[00:37] Satoshi was trying to do here it's about
[00:38] separation of money estate it's about
[00:40] the new money and money is something you
[00:43] you earn you save it and you spend
[00:47] [Music]
[00:50] it hi Craig how you doing good to have
[00:54] you back on the
[00:56] show yeah good I'm super happy to be
[00:58] here like I was saying I'm like super
[01:01] impressed on how your Channel's grown
[01:03] and you know you've had some really
[01:04] really great interviews um yeah I'm
[01:07] pretty great grateful I was one of your
[01:09] early days uh you know before you
[01:11] exploded so it's great to be
[01:13] back yeah I I even was in my fear job uh
[01:18] still so like when I did it uh the when
[01:21] I recorded the podcast with you I was
[01:23] basically still working I think like 30
[01:26] hours or 25 hours uh on on the side in
[01:28] my fear shop so it's come a long way
[01:32] totally totally it's amazing it's so
[01:34] great to watch and and you know it's a
[01:35] testament to how bitcoin's growing and
[01:38] you know how much there's a thirst for
[01:40] that knowledge and and you know hearing
[01:41] what's going on and you know it just
[01:43] helps it helps Bitcoin adoption so it
[01:45] it's great to see your success um
[01:47] because it just shows how important it
[01:49] is yeah and I think when we recorded uh
[01:54] there was just the ETF launch or maybe
[01:56] not even the ETF launch like it was
[01:58] right at like there so much happening in
[02:01] in one year in Bitcoin it's kind of
[02:03] crazy very true like you're right
[02:06] there's so much building going on in
[02:08] like so many areas of Bitcoin you know
[02:10] like you're right like the ETFs weren't
[02:12] were just kind of in the in the midst of
[02:14] kind of you know trying to get approvals
[02:16] and you know all that happened uh you
[02:19] know and then tons of development going
[02:21] on you know like in the sense of uh from
[02:24] on the mining side on the you know user
[02:26] adoption side like just so much going on
[02:28] like it it's this is what I love about
[02:30] Bitcoin is there's so many rabbit holes
[02:32] to go down and so much to learn and and
[02:35] just so much going on absolutely um
[02:38] maybe let's start directly there uh with
[02:40] the adoption which has been happening uh
[02:44] there is obviously the ETF now maybe
[02:46] tomorrow there's something crazy
[02:48] launching with with Donald Trump but we
[02:50] don't know people that listen to this
[02:52] probably already know uh and uh there
[02:55] there is outside of that uh everywhere
[02:58] like um uh circular economies popping up
[03:02] uh there is like the meetups as you said
[03:04] there is like events getting always
[03:07] bigger and bigger the conference is
[03:09] getting bigger and bigger so there are
[03:11] so many different angles uh how do you
[03:13] look at adoption how do you even uh how
[03:17] are we even measuring adoption and what
[03:19] what are you kind of looking at of of
[03:21] like events and and measuring the this
[03:23] kind of adoption that's going on oh
[03:25] measuring it's interesting I I see two
[03:27] kind of angles to this I I think you
[03:30] know the the the Fiat value of um
[03:33] Bitcoin and you know the store value the
[03:36] whole asset view like that's what we're
[03:38] seeing with the ETFs you know it's being
[03:40] sold to investors it's being sold to
[03:43] Traders you know like hey this is like a
[03:45] new stock a new asset right and so I
[03:48] think we're getting a lot of that crowd
[03:49] over the last year is is people going
[03:51] like hey I'm gonna you know move my
[03:53] money into micro strategy uh strategy
[03:56] now U you know and I'm going to hold it
[03:58] there right like they would hold gold or
[04:01] silver or you know u a mutual fund or
[04:04] whatever so we're getting that crowd
[04:06] coming in you know that are looking at
[04:07] Bitcoin purely as you know a an asset
[04:11] that's going to you know a a place to
[04:13] save their money and grow their money so
[04:16] uh I think we're seeing a lot of that
[04:18] and so we're you know I I notic this a
[04:21] lot on X is we're seeing those people
[04:23] and that the conversation really about
[04:25] you know the value uh of of Bitcoin in
[04:28] Fiat terms and the swing you know like
[04:30] oh it's up it's down and so I think that
[04:33] helps kind of pull people into the the
[04:36] the discourse into the conversation
[04:38] about Bitcoin um which is good um but I
[04:41] think there's also the conversation
[04:43] about you know the growth and the
[04:44] adoption of the use of Bitcoin and I
[04:47] think if you look at you know the
[04:48] hardcore bitcoiners they're starting
[04:50] more to talk about that of like you know
[04:51] it's not just something you save like
[04:53] again what's the you know if we go back
[04:55] to what Satoshi was trying to do here
[04:57] it's about separation of money estate
[04:59] it's about you know the new money you
[05:01] know a and and money is something you
[05:04] you earn you save it and you spend it
[05:08] you know and I think a lot of people are
[05:10] afraid to spend it which is fine because
[05:13] we're we're still in these early days of
[05:15] you know uh volatility and the price you
[05:18] know still growing and growing and these
[05:20] predictions of1 million and10 million
[05:23] valuations just make people really hold
[05:25] it and so you know I still spend Bitcoin
[05:28] I use it and I think you know as we see
[05:31] you know I like the things like the
[05:33] development that's going on with using
[05:35] it like Noster is a good example where
[05:37] you know people are using you know their
[05:40] zapping SATs you know like micro
[05:42] payments going on where people are
[05:44] actually using it you know they're
[05:45] they're they're starting to build those
[05:46] use cases so I I'm looking at both of
[05:49] those coins you know I think it's good
[05:50] to see these you know Traders and you
[05:54] know you know the the ho holders kind of
[05:57] coming into the market but it's a moment
[05:59] to educate them so they're they're
[06:00] starting to look at what am I holding
[06:02] here and and hopefully that's making the
[06:04] transition and the education to Bringing
[06:07] people more into like oh this is not
[06:09] just digital gold there's more to it and
[06:12] you know lots of development going on on
[06:14] that usage side that that I think just
[06:17] doesn't get as much
[06:18] attention uh you know and requires it so
[06:21] I think those are the two kind of you
[06:23] know the ways I'm measuring it is the
[06:25] progress in those areas and so it's uh
[06:28] it's definitely interesting to watch
[06:29] because I think we're seeing it with the
[06:31] the holders and the Traders they're you
[06:34] know they're bringing the Wall Street
[06:36] thinking to bitcoin and that's just one
[06:38] small aspect of it so I think lots of
[06:40] work to do lots of learning to happen
[06:42] but but those are the that's what I'm
[06:44] seeing right now I guess over the last
[06:46] year yeah there's this this straty
[06:49] coming into to bitcoin I mean literally
[06:52] ETFs and now at the second year of the
[06:54] ETF which is interesting because ETFs
[06:56] usually take a little bit to really get
[06:58] into full Swit
[07:00] uh and this processes usually take like
[07:02] half a year to a year so it will be
[07:03] really interesting also to see how the
[07:06] second year of the ETF going uh and then
[07:09] like the nation states and it's like um
[07:12] there's a lot of different players now
[07:15] in in in the Bitcoin how did you see the
[07:17] the impact of that currently um yeah the
[07:21] the nation state stuff is very
[07:22] interesting you know I don't know if
[07:24] you've kind of seen me on X like I'm not
[07:26] like a I don't care about governments
[07:27] holding Bitcoin like I think think
[07:29] there's been a huge push with that and
[07:32] and again you know I think I think the
[07:35] huge push you know coming from like
[07:36] Bitcoin magazine and and some of these
[07:38] other kind of like you know groups you
[07:40] know is really about trying to
[07:42] legitimize it uh and you know I think
[07:46] the better thing is like you know don't
[07:47] add capital gains to bitcoin you know
[07:49] like all those things are probably more
[07:50] important than you know governments
[07:52] holding it like I keep saying on X you
[07:54] know hey everybody here you me and you
[07:57] know everybody needs a strategic Bitcoin
[07:59] Reserve like we all need to get off zero
[08:01] and you know holding Bitcoin and I think
[08:05] again it's more of to me the government
[08:07] side is like marketing right it's like
[08:10] just another conversation to get more
[08:12] people thinking about it a and more
[08:14] maybe it legitimize it so so that you
[08:17] know the average consumer is kind of
[08:19] like okay now it's not that secret
[08:21] shadowy money that only you know drug
[08:24] dealers and and hackers use which I
[08:26] think you know is still the Discord and
[08:27] maybe some of the you know the less uh
[08:30] educated you know um you know part of
[08:32] the consumers out there so you know I
[08:35] think that's part of it but but again
[08:37] what we're seeing right now like with
[08:39] you know um the US and you know their
[08:42] strategic crypto reserve and all that
[08:44] like I I think there's just you know
[08:47] there's there's just a a little too much
[08:49] influence going on there in regards to
[08:52] you know all these other tokens and
[08:54] stuff like that I think there's really
[08:55] like VC you know a VC kind of in charge
[08:58] of crypto is really taking it from a
[09:00] different angle and you know I don't
[09:03] know I I there's obviously challenges
[09:05] with that so I think it's good for the
[09:08] Discord it's good for pumping people's
[09:11] bags per se but um you know at the end
[09:14] of the day I go back to adoption and
[09:16] like this is where we need to move this
[09:18] you know that's part of the same trade
[09:20] fi group I guess that's kind of into
[09:22] Bitcoin right now they're not bitcoiners
[09:24] they're people again looking at it as
[09:26] just digital gold purely as a store of
[09:29] value
[09:30] uh that's going to go up forever right
[09:31] and so that's fine um so I care more
[09:35] about maybe for the marketing message of
[09:37] it getting more legitimacy out to the
[09:39] general population about this and maybe
[09:42] governments relaxing their Bitcoin laws
[09:45] and things like that because the US is
[09:47] now you know you know becomes a holder
[09:49] which they already are but you know so I
[09:52] I see it as that as probably the the
[09:54] better part of it um I don't know we'll
[09:57] see what happens this week you know as
[09:59] as uh they bring all these different
[10:01] kind of crypto CEOs to the White House
[10:04] to to talk about it so uh yeah we'll see
[10:07] what happens I guess there absolutely um
[10:10] and it's also a good message of like we
[10:13] we should cheer for cross roots adoption
[10:15] and pl spying Bitcoin and not for nation
[10:18] states like we Bitcoin is not here to
[10:22] make nation states and in governments
[10:24] and maybe even central banks more
[10:26] powerful it's the other way
[10:28] around 100% like Bitcoin is about
[10:30] peer-to-peer without a third party right
[10:33] like it's it's about empowering the
[10:35] people um you know so I think that's the
[10:38] message that's been getting drowned out
[10:39] a lot um you know because of the trade
[10:42] five people coming for the gains right
[10:44] so again this is why I like you know
[10:47] been working on our Meetup and growing
[10:49] that you know education is the key right
[10:51] it's really about teaching people and
[10:53] you know putting out a clearer message
[10:56] about you know what Bitcoin is here to
[10:58] do
[10:59] uh but again it's a balance right you
[11:02] know we wouldn't have the opportunity to
[11:04] educate people if they weren't kind of
[11:06] brought in for the you know holy cow how
[11:10] is Bitcoin
[11:11] $100,000 right so I think it it's a
[11:13] balance that we have to to play with um
[11:17] but again at the end of the day Bitcoin
[11:19] doesn't care it'll do what it does you
[11:21] know and uh it it's going to react I
[11:25] guess to the market but in the end of
[11:26] the day we all know if you're a pleb you
[11:29] you kind of really have dove into this
[11:31] subject uh you know where it's going in
[11:33] the long run what is what do you think
[11:36] is the most important thing that that we
[11:39] could do to enhance Bitcoin adoption I I
[11:41] guess it's orange pilling our neighbors
[11:43] and and and like bringing it into the
[11:45] crossroads I guess yeah I think one of
[11:48] the aspects of um you know what sailor
[11:52] is doing with uh strategy and you know
[11:55] Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level
[11:58] and having businesses hold uh you know
[12:00] Bitcoin and I think that's an important
[12:04] part because I think once you as a
[12:06] business if you're now comfortable
[12:08] holding Bitcoin in your treasury then
[12:11] you're going to start to want to
[12:13] accumulate more Bitcoin which I think
[12:15] then we start to see businesses you know
[12:18] adopting Bitcoin as a medium of exchange
[12:22] that's kind of where I'm hoping we're
[12:23] starting to go so now you know
[12:25] unfortunately you know micro strategy
[12:26] doesn't even do this you know like they
[12:28] they have know half a million Bitcoin
[12:30] and you know you can't even buy their
[12:31] swag with Bitcoin right you still got to
[12:34] use Fiat so to me I I think the next
[12:37] phase here is legitimizing businesses to
[12:40] hold it and then now getting businesses
[12:42] to accept it right because if like let's
[12:46] say if Amazon started accepting Bitcoin
[12:49] directly you know people start to use it
[12:52] as a medium of exchange and I think
[12:54] that's the kind of the the that's the
[12:57] next direction we're going that that's
[12:58] where we to get to because I think that
[13:01] again making it a medium exchange brings
[13:03] it closer to money uh now I know you
[13:05] know Michael sailor I think I don't know
[13:07] whether it's political or not but you
[13:08] know he very much focuses on store value
[13:11] and not so much medium of exchange and
[13:14] uh I don't know if that narrative is
[13:16] political at this stage where he's you
[13:19] know trying to get maybe certain
[13:20] policies or certain kind of regulations
[13:22] in place before you know maybe he
[13:25] changes his tune to back to what you
[13:27] know Satoshi was really talking about
[13:29] about um but we'll see but but I think
[13:32] business adoption is is a huge part and
[13:34] again orange pilling you know uh people
[13:36] obviously that's always the goal um but
[13:39] yeah we just need more businesses that
[13:41] are accepting it and feel comfortable
[13:43] accepting it right because I think a
[13:45] business is much more regulated than an
[13:48] individual in the sense of you know a
[13:50] lot of people will will you know a lot
[13:52] of plebs will maybe live under the radar
[13:55] you know and accept Bitcoin and they're
[13:56] you know you know they're not
[13:59] scrutinized as businesses are from the
[14:01] government and from Banks and stuff like
[14:02] that so um you know a lot of companies
[14:04] have been getting unbanked you know
[14:06] because they're in the Bitcoin or crypto
[14:08] space and so uh I think that's where you
[14:12] know I think we'll see a bit more
[14:14] comfort in that and and then they start
[14:17] to accept Bitcoin so that's why I'm
[14:20] hoping things go that's where I think
[14:21] things are going you know yeah and and
[14:24] for that we also need the kind of top
[14:27] down thing because if all of the sudden
[14:30] governments are starting to adopt it buy
[14:32] it maybe even like accept it for taxes
[14:35] and stuff like that um then the unbanked
[14:39] stuff uh and those kind of things also
[14:42] slowly slowly go away and then business
[14:44] are not as afraid to adopt it as also as
[14:46] a med of exchange so I think there like
[14:49] the all those small pieces uh that they
[14:52] come together and at some point it all
[14:55] makes sense but it it it all seems early
[14:58] for for for spending it I mean I already
[15:01] accepting it for for my my podcast I I
[15:04] take sponsorships already in Bitcoin
[15:06] most of my income actually is already in
[15:07] Bitcoin I also uh pay post production
[15:10] already in Bitcoin um uh but but it it
[15:14] seems like it's it's it's like how as
[15:19] early uh Bitcoin as a store of value was
[15:22] in like 2010 it's now the medi of
[15:24] exchange side of things uh for for
[15:26] Bitcoin because like it's still hard to
[15:29] to pay things in
[15:31] Bitcoin yeah very much so you know it's
[15:34] the infrastructure is still coming like
[15:36] we've got BTC pay server and and things
[15:39] like that for you know for for doing
[15:41] that Ln bits like having you know people
[15:43] running their own lightning uh servers
[15:45] or nodes and things like that so I think
[15:48] that we have to there's still lots of
[15:49] work to do there but but it but it's
[15:51] definitely happening you know I you know
[15:54] I everything in Bitcoin happens slowly
[15:56] because it seems to have to happen
[15:58] correctly you know what I mean like it's
[16:00] it's it's why you can't change you know
[16:03] Bitcoin core very quickly it takes
[16:05] massive amounts of consensus and I think
[16:07] you know that's similar with this is is
[16:08] getting it right so you're you're right
[16:11] like people are like yourself you know
[16:13] you're starting to to live on a Bitcoin
[16:15] standard you know it's not going to be a
[16:16] light switch moment it's going to be you
[16:19] know little bits at a time and uh you
[16:22] know and then you talking about that and
[16:24] you teaching people that it's possible
[16:26] you know you still look out out there on
[16:27] X and and all of the crypto people you
[16:31] know still think lightning is slow and
[16:33] they still like they you know they just
[16:35] kind of there's so much rhetoric out
[16:37] there you know and and things Chang so
[16:39] fast you know in this world that you
[16:42] know a narrative from a year ago is
[16:45] outdated you know because Tech has
[16:47] improved and liquidity on Lightning has
[16:49] improved and and and you know there's
[16:51] more nodes out there and more channels
[16:54] and so it's like everything changes so
[16:56] fast and you know when when a Satoshi
[16:58] was worth you know nothing you know a
[17:00] couple of years ago you know now we're
[17:02] approaching on you know you know you
[17:05] know a tenth of a penny right like it's
[17:06] starting to the value keeps going up and
[17:09] so uh you know I don't know I think it's
[17:13] it's just it just takes time you know
[17:15] and I I'm W I just wrote an article that
[17:17] I'm going to post later this week on you
[17:19] know how to get on to a Bitcoin standard
[17:21] and as I was researching this like
[17:23] there's so many ways to do it now and so
[17:25] many different companies that you know
[17:27] helping bridge that Gap where where you
[17:29] know if you want to buy at the Gap you
[17:31] know you can get you know gift cards you
[17:34] know that allow you you know buying gift
[17:36] cards with your Bitcoin to then buy at
[17:38] those stores you know like that is a
[17:40] bridge right now whereas eventually
[17:42] you'll be able to buy directly at Gap
[17:44] and so to me it's like we're still in
[17:47] the early early days of really being
[17:49] able to like you know Bridge the two
[17:53] economies the Fiat economy and and the
[17:55] Bitcoin
[17:57] economy will it be a
[17:59] a bridge or Rel or replacement long term
[18:02] I mean obviously not not anytime soon
[18:04] but is it more of like an an integrating
[18:07] Bitcoin or replacing the fear system I
[18:10] think we're going to integrate before we
[18:11] replace like it's it's it's again it's
[18:14] not going to be a light switch moment
[18:15] where all of a sudden you know these
[18:17] businesses stop accepting Fiat right
[18:20] like it we're going to be in parallel
[18:22] world for a long time like look look at
[18:23] the internet you know if you go back to
[18:26] the early days you know bookstores are a
[18:28] great example right like we still have
[18:30] bookstores physical bookstores right and
[18:32] physical bookstores are like Fiat and
[18:34] then the internet came along right and
[18:36] they created online bookstores like
[18:38] Amazon and chapters and indigo and all
[18:40] these other ones right and so they
[18:42] started to you know consumers started to
[18:44] go into this new uh online world this
[18:47] new internet-based buying thing but
[18:50] again we still have physical bookstores
[18:52] so I think you know it it's going to
[18:54] take a while I think we're going to live
[18:56] in a parallel world for quite some time
[19:00] but uh but yeah the bridge right now it
[19:01] is a bridge right you kind of have to
[19:03] still jump back into the Fiat world to
[19:05] interact with some of these corporations
[19:07] who don't uh aren't on a Bitcoin
[19:09] standard don't accept Bitcoin but
[19:11] eventually like I said as business
[19:13] adoption kind of grows I think those
[19:16] bridges will change you won't buy gift
[19:17] cards anymore to exchange for Fiat to
[19:20] buy you'll probably move into a you know
[19:22] you'll buy directly with satoshi's you
[19:25] know to these companies and we're
[19:27] already seeing it it's it's just slow
[19:29] moving you know um you know I I also
[19:32] think the whole social media aspect of
[19:35] of getting consumers to start using
[19:37] Satoshi like on Noster you know we're
[19:39] looking at Rumble the the YouTube
[19:42] competitor who's now been orange pills
[19:44] you know I think we'll start to see him
[19:46] you know bringing in uh you know Bitcoin
[19:49] as a medium of exchange on their
[19:50] platform for for people like yourself
[19:53] you know you get paid probably by
[19:55] YouTube and Fiat and have to then
[19:57] convert that into you know Bitcoin you
[20:00] know to some extent and so you know what
[20:02] if YouTube started paying you directly
[20:04] in Bitcoin I think that's the direction
[20:06] we'll see Rumble go uh you know and so
[20:10] it takes time right that that's all
[20:12] infrastructure that needs to be built
[20:13] that's not you know super easy but but
[20:16] that's how things go mainstream right is
[20:18] when when a a mainstream brand starts to
[20:21] leverage Bitcoin and really understand
[20:23] it so we'll
[20:25] see I I think I have U maybe an
[20:28] interesting example and uh uh or
[20:31] comparison um and I'm really curious on
[20:33] on what you think about that uh we we
[20:36] see
[20:38] the the adoption of the car is something
[20:41] that really fascinates me in that regard
[20:43] uh here you have New York City uh and
[20:46] you have like 1900 so you have like one
[20:49] car here and most of that is like Horse
[20:52] Carriers uh and if you go just like uh
[20:55] 13 years later there's mostly cars on
[20:57] the road and and there's like some
[20:59] horses uh so the adoption went really
[21:03] quick
[21:04] but in Austria I live in Vienna you can
[21:08] still see horse carriages especially if
[21:11] you go out on a Sunday and where it's
[21:13] sunny and a good one people still like
[21:15] to go in those vintage Horse Carriers uh
[21:19] but it's like
[21:21] 0.00001% of the traffic now in in
[21:25] Austria or like probably also of the
[21:27] world uh most people have now for
[21:30] individual trends for cars so I think
[21:33] that that might be an interesting
[21:35] comparison to to make between uh feared
[21:39] feared uh uh currencies and Bitcoin
[21:42] where the adoption goes actually quite
[21:45] quickly but uh the the fear thing is
[21:49] longer around than than expected yeah I
[21:52] love this analogy and I I've actually
[21:54] used this similar analogy you know when
[21:57] we look at how old Bitcoin is you know
[21:59] so many you you see here again in the
[22:00] crypto world you know Boomer coin and
[22:02] how old it is and I'm like Bitcoin is
[22:04] still so new like go back like when was
[22:07] the automobile invented you know in the
[22:09] late 1800s you know and 50 look at the
[22:13] automobiles 15 years after the
[22:16] automobile was invented you know it's
[22:18] still made out of wood it's still this
[22:20] like you know in today's standards of
[22:22] automobiles like it is a rickety old
[22:26] rocking chair you know and then you look
[22:28] at where we are today 100 years after
[22:32] you know the automobile and it looks
[22:34] nothing like this thing right like this
[22:36] is the era we're in right now in Bitcoin
[22:38] you know this is this is you know this
[22:41] is the infrastructure for the automobile
[22:43] you know you know 15 years or whatever
[22:46] you know 10 years after it was invented
[22:48] so yes technology grows faster and all
[22:51] that but you know maybe we're in
[22:53] year 30 if to comparison it to this
[22:56] because technology grows
[22:59] and you know develops way faster today
[23:01] but again we're still in the early days
[23:03] right like so there's so much work to be
[23:06] done on layer twos um you know we're
[23:08] seeing all kinds of things happening you
[23:11] know in that kind of space where you
[23:14] know it's still developing you know and
[23:16] so you're right I think we you know we
[23:19] will still see a lot of the old stuff
[23:21] around like people look at these
[23:23] vehicles still exist you know uh my my
[23:27] wife run runs a big car meet up here in
[23:29] Canada and we go out on Sundays and
[23:31] there is some like 1,900 cars that you
[23:34] know collectors bring out they still run
[23:37] you know it's not their daily driver
[23:39] they're not driving across the country
[23:41] you know to go on a trip with these
[23:42] things but they still exist and I think
[23:45] Fiat money will be you know it will be
[23:48] novelty that's what we'll slowly get to
[23:50] is novelty just like coins are you know
[23:52] nobody you know we have coin collectors
[23:54] and money collectors you know those
[23:56] things will still exist you know um
[23:59] you know I even look at it's the the
[24:01] digital cash versus you know current
[24:04] cash like in some countries you know
[24:07] there's fights going on to keep physical
[24:09] cash whereas some businesses don't
[24:11] accept physical cash anymore right and
[24:13] so we're seeing we're seeing that world
[24:17] change even in the Fiat where it's like
[24:18] oh here's my coins and paper bills and
[24:21] they're like no we don't accept that you
[24:22] got to use a debit card because we want
[24:24] to track the transactions you know you
[24:26] know and we don't want cash it's too
[24:28] messy it's too hard to deal with and the
[24:31] business doesn't want to deal in it
[24:32] anymore and governments are like now
[24:34] forcing businesses you have to accept
[24:35] cash no you don't and there's whole
[24:37] discussions about that so you know I I
[24:40] think it's here to stay for a bit right
[24:42] but the the smart money is is is moving
[24:45] in this
[24:46] direction interesting yeah there there's
[24:48] one more small thing uh it I guess
[24:52] brought it up and and then never uh had
[24:55] took a look at it before and now I'm
[24:57] obsessing with with the data point so
[24:59] much uh where he compared kind of the
[25:02] the speed of the adoption of certain uh
[25:06] Technologies like we have the telephone
[25:07] electricity radio and all of those
[25:10] things uh and the internet was way
[25:12] quicker in in in getting adopted uh the
[25:15] the social media was way quicker and
[25:17] adopted uh and and like all the things
[25:19] that come from the internet like the
[25:21] smartphone the digital cameras like
[25:23] social media uh all of those things even
[25:25] like credit cards are here which is an
[25:27] interesting one um also to to to see uh
[25:33] and and it it it makes me sometimes
[25:34] wonder because like we know things get
[25:37] adopted really quick but money has such
[25:41] a hard uh Network effect people are so
[25:45] used to money uh so it's it's way harder
[25:48] to um adopt something like that if you
[25:51] if you think about a new app it's it it
[25:55] almost it's so easy to install a new
[25:57] social media app I have um a friend of
[26:00] mine a really good one wants to get me
[26:03] on sessions and session is a really
[26:05] secure private messenger and it costs me
[26:08] nothing to install it and uh make
[26:13] messages with him there but I'm I'm so
[26:16] reluctant to do that because it's the
[26:18] fifth or sixth messenger that I use and
[26:20] I'm like it's it's another messenger
[26:21] like it's it's so uh and it's so hard to
[26:26] get out of the network effects that
[26:28] WhatsApp has and and the telegram has
[26:30] and that Twitter has how and with money
[26:33] there's a real opportunity cost people
[26:35] like they can lose and win a lot of
[26:37] money uh uh uh depending on where they
[26:41] go with the the the the thing you can
[26:43] have two different social media apps but
[26:45] but you cannot have two different
[26:47] standards you cannot be a Fiat standard
[26:49] and Bitcoin standard at the same time
[26:51] you can only be 5050 there which makes
[26:53] me think of uh is is is Bitcoin kind of
[26:57] an exception to the this
[26:59] fast adoption Cycles uh of of social
[27:02] media and internet uh I don't know if
[27:05] you even have an opinion on that I just
[27:06] like just thought about it when we
[27:08] talking about it but it it's it's really
[27:10] interesting to think of like okay
[27:11] Bitcoin is money which is a really hard
[27:13] Network effect but it's also like a
[27:16] technology like eii or or the internet
[27:20] how do you see that
[27:22] topic yeah I agree with you it's
[27:25] definitely a lot slower money definitely
[27:27] obviously has the best network effects
[27:29] right and it and it's very ingrained you
[27:32] know you know everybody in the last
[27:34] hundred years has been using government
[27:36] controlled money right and so I think
[27:38] moving off of that is you know is is a
[27:42] lot more difficult and it takes a lot
[27:44] more education and unfortunately you
[27:47] know financial literacy around the world
[27:50] is terrible you know like people don't
[27:53] know how their money is created they
[27:56] don't really know about inflation so
[27:57] we're getting knowledge on this and and
[28:00] I you know I just there's just a huge
[28:03] gap in people understanding economics
[28:05] understanding inflation understanding
[28:07] you know the the the whole point of
[28:09] money the history of money like this why
[28:11] we see so many of these books coming out
[28:13] you know like Lawrence Leer's new one
[28:15] you know and Lyn Alden all these new
[28:17] books coming out you knowed and Bitcoin
[28:19] standard obviously educating people on
[28:21] money and and I don't think there's been
[28:24] more people learning about money ever
[28:27] before you know like there was a very it
[28:29] was a very Niche subject before you know
[28:32] it was it was for people that wanted to
[28:34] go into finance and economics and maybe
[28:37] into like business administration but
[28:39] like most people just kind of took money
[28:41] for granted and it is what it is and
[28:43] there was no option before so you know I
[28:46] think I think this is a generational
[28:49] change you know like our younger
[28:51] generation has paid more attention to
[28:53] money there's more knowledge coming out
[28:55] that's kind of contradicting the Fiat
[28:57] system but I do agree I think it's still
[29:00] going to take time you know and it's
[29:02] going to the you know this is I guess
[29:04] again I keep talking about Noster like
[29:06] these are the killer apps that kind of
[29:08] bring people on I think I was watching a
[29:10] talk about um you know somebody that one
[29:13] of the Noster kind of influencers
[29:15] talking about how um you know there's
[29:18] lots of bitcoiners on Noster but there's
[29:20] also Freedom people and people that
[29:22] maybe learned more about Bitcoin or
[29:24] adopted Bitcoin after they got into
[29:26] Noster right someone's Z them a few SATs
[29:29] and they're like what the hell is this
[29:30] you know oh they start to look oh it's
[29:32] Bitcoin oh this is neat and they see the
[29:34] value proposition of like oh I I'm I
[29:37] post a meme and someone's giving me a
[29:39] couple of Satoshi and so you know I
[29:42] think it's those kind of killer apps and
[29:44] those experiences that we need to kind
[29:46] of develop to bring more people into it
[29:49] right and so yeah I think adoption is
[29:52] going to be slower just because the
[29:53] network effects that money has and also
[29:57] the headwinds right right like you know
[29:59] who was stopping you from downloading
[30:01] the YouTube app or the WhatsApp like
[30:04] there was no like major like
[30:07] governmental or political push back
[30:09] right and so Bitcoin you know yes it's
[30:12] revolutionary but the Old Guard all the
[30:15] current political uh parties the people
[30:17] that have you know all the the Pol
[30:20] politicians all have their own central
[30:23] bank right like so there there's
[30:25] headwinds in the state against something
[30:28] that they already control so I think you
[30:31] know you look at all those other
[30:32] Technologies you know who was pushing
[30:34] back on the microwave nobody you know
[30:36] who who is pushing back on social media
[30:39] nobody right and so I think that's why
[30:41] it's there's more headwinds for Bitcoin
[30:44] as money because it's you know it's
[30:47] trying
[30:48] to replace something that is you know
[30:51] cemented into our political Arena and
[30:54] into you know Society so going to take a
[30:58] lot more right and and you know I think
[31:02] you see the political landscape that
[31:04] we're having today you know you know
[31:06] America versus so many other countries
[31:09] and like there's just you know we're
[31:10] getting on US versus them kind of uh
[31:14] conversation even sovereignty is being
[31:16] pushed right now like the whole
[31:17] conversation of sovereignty and and
[31:20] countries you know you know with uh with
[31:22] you know Trump talking about taking
[31:24] Canada or Greenland or you know all
[31:26] these kind of things like it it it's now
[31:28] bringing sovereignty into the the social
[31:31] Discord and so I think you know that's
[31:34] interesting in that you know people
[31:36] didn't pay attention to these things
[31:37] before so again they start to pay
[31:39] attention they start to ask questions
[31:41] and that's what you know starts to
[31:43] Snowball the effect of of you know
[31:46] people learning these things let's take
[31:47] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[31:50] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[31:53] the Bitcoin watches those watches are
[31:56] the most amazing the most elegent way of
[31:59] showing that you are a true bitcoiner
[32:02] and coin vigilante just dropped a
[32:04] completely new an amazing Genesis
[32:07] edition of their watch collections you
[32:10] have the date of the first ever mined
[32:13] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[32:16] also the block height and which Epoch we
[32:19] are currently in I love the level of
[32:22] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[32:25] make sure to check out those amazing
[32:27] coin V the time pieces down in the
[32:30] descriptions I love those watches so so
[32:33] much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[32:35] really do hope that you don't have it on
[32:38] Exchange but if you do have it on
[32:39] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[32:42] with that the first way is you put it on
[32:44] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[32:47] you to get into the self custody game I
[32:50] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[32:53] for that it's a super simple and secure
[32:56] way and if you check out the link in the
[32:58] description you even get 5% off if you
[33:01] use the code Robin and the second way is
[33:04] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[33:07] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[33:11] most out of your sovereignty they will
[33:14] personalize for you a self custody setup
[33:17] that is perfect for your individual
[33:20] situation they will show you how you can
[33:22] secure your own devices securing your
[33:25] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[33:27] keep all your devices secure one topic
[33:30] that is overlooked often is the
[33:32] inheritance plan what happens with your
[33:35] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[33:38] you have a plan for that in place
[33:40] already and last but not least if you're
[33:42] in jurisdictions where you don't feel
[33:44] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[33:47] that head over to the Bitcoin way.com
[33:51] Robin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:55] just a quick side note I will be for the
[33:57] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[34:00] prog event in June it will be absolutely
[34:04] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[34:06] to seeing all of you there you can get
[34:08] your ticket in the link down in the
[34:10] description of Bitcoin brag and very
[34:13] important use code Robin to get 10% off
[34:17] your ticket I'm really looking forward
[34:19] seeing you there I love the thing that
[34:21] you said a little bit earlier of like uh
[34:24] how many people study money right now
[34:26] and and how much
[34:28] did they change because of Bitcoin and I
[34:30] think if uh Bitcoin breaks tomorrow that
[34:33] would have been still a massive success
[34:36] just because people started to paying
[34:39] attention what money actually is and and
[34:41] what a good money is and what a bad
[34:43] money is and how uh money is different
[34:46] from a currency and all those things uh
[34:49] I never never looked at it that way
[34:52] because uh it it really um I think pred
[34:56] probably popularized the the the the
[34:58] question of like what is money and he
[35:00] kind of positions it as like the the
[35:02] defining question of of our um of our
[35:07] our time and I think it's a very very
[35:09] important one like what is money and and
[35:12] and where where does it come from and
[35:15] and and and what is the the best one and
[35:18] uh that is already a major success for
[35:21] Bitcoin because Bitcoin I never would
[35:23] have questioned what is money without
[35:25] Bitcoin I was a stock Pro before before
[35:29] H and and Bitcoin made me realize what
[35:31] money is and also made me realize the
[35:33] value of gold yeah you know I 100% agree
[35:36] I worked in a central bank as a
[35:37] technologist you know and you know I
[35:40] worked with economists and people in the
[35:42] treasury and you know I when I kind of
[35:45] came across Bitcoin I learned more about
[35:48] economics than I ever knew and about you
[35:50] know the origins of money and the
[35:52] history and and like you said how money
[35:54] is created you know and when you start
[35:56] to look at that you start start to
[35:58] really you get frustrated when you learn
[36:01] that you know the Federal Reserve is a
[36:02] private company and you know how you
[36:05] know we all learn like oh 2% inflation
[36:08] is you know that's the Target and you
[36:10] know everybody's talking that in the
[36:12] news and everybody just accepts that you
[36:14] know they're inflating the currency in
[36:16] every country you know 2% you know since
[36:19] they're they're stealing 2% of your
[36:20] buying power year-over-year you know
[36:23] which is now even higher in the last few
[36:25] years and and even crazier in some
[36:26] countries that have experienced you know
[36:28] 200% inflation so you know that
[36:31] information was just kind of normal and
[36:34] not really you know whatever came
[36:36] through the six o'clock news was just
[36:38] accepted as okay normal and the way it
[36:42] is so you know I think we're realizing
[36:45] now that you know not only how bad the
[36:48] way it is is that there is an
[36:50] alternative but uh you're right the the
[36:52] win of people learning about this and
[36:55] the younger generation you know even
[36:57] though that are in crypto you know and
[36:59] not Bitcoin you know kind of maximalists
[37:02] or what if if you want to say it but you
[37:04] know even they learning more about money
[37:06] so there's a whole new area of uh you
[37:09] know or a whole new generation of people
[37:12] that are paying attention to something
[37:13] that the previous generations just kind
[37:15] of ignored and accepted for the way it
[37:17] is I completely forgot that you I think
[37:20] you mentioned it last time that you
[37:21] worked for Central Bank uh you don't do
[37:23] it anymore right no no no I still work
[37:26] in Tech and uh you know I still consult
[37:29] but not to not to central banks and um
[37:32] you know it's interesting the central
[37:34] bank that I was working at you know was
[37:35] more of a regional type Bank uh and you
[37:38] know they've just I've watched them
[37:40] struggle for years you know they were
[37:42] they had technology and they were also
[37:45] you know a trade services to to uh to
[37:48] other Banks and you know their margins
[37:51] just got thinner and thinner and you
[37:54] know trying to be tech company in a very
[37:57] high regulated World building you know
[37:59] online banking technology and fintech
[38:01] solutions like it is a tough business um
[38:04] you know to turn a profit in because
[38:06] it's so regulated uh and because the
[38:09] systems are so Antiquated like they're
[38:11] still struggling to maintain the banking
[38:13] infrastructure that is super outdated
[38:17] very complex and highly regulated um you
[38:21] know and again they also struggle to
[38:23] retain Talent you know you know you look
[38:26] at you look at the tech Talent out there
[38:29] and do they want to go work for you know
[38:31] a Legacy Bank that still has cobal you
[38:34] know running systems and still has you
[38:36] know Microsoft Access kind of tools that
[38:39] are you know and they're not going to go
[38:41] there they're going to you know crypto
[38:43] companies and Bitcoin companies and they
[38:45] want to they want to code the future so
[38:48] a lot of those financial institutions
[38:50] although they have huge amounts of money
[38:52] they tend to give it to their Executives
[38:55] and and they struggle to to recruit you
[38:57] know you know highly skilled you know
[39:01] top of their game you know technical
[39:03] talent to to to work on the Legacy
[39:06] system you know it's definitely they
[39:08] have a a a branding challenge there
[39:10] where you know I I fall into that it's
[39:12] like I don't want to you know if I
[39:13] wanted to go back into Tech and finance
[39:15] the last place I'm going to go is a bank
[39:17] you know it's you know unless they're
[39:20] moving into you know Bitcoin and they're
[39:22] looking at you know the more Advanced
[39:24] Technologies you know so it's yeah it's
[39:28] definitely
[39:29] interesting I do you think banks will um
[39:32] uh adopt Bitcoin will it are they just
[39:37] gonna either adopt it or just die or was
[39:41] or like a micro strategy and like
[39:44] Bitcoin exchanges like Swan and River
[39:46] like the new
[39:47] Banks yeah that's interesting um yeah I
[39:51] think it's what you said in the
[39:51] beginning I think there there there'll
[39:53] be some that adopt and some that will
[39:56] die and and banks are very slow moving
[39:59] to adopt new technology let alone new
[40:03] money right and I think it's such a
[40:06] paradigm shift for their for those
[40:09] Executives you know they're they're the
[40:12] most Fiat brained people right like
[40:14] they've lived and breathed the Fiat
[40:16] World they know the tricks they know the
[40:17] trades they know how all the regulations
[40:19] work you know the Banking Act all of
[40:21] those things like they their knowledge
[40:23] base is confined to the Fiat system so
[40:26] like the paradigm shift it requires in
[40:29] their brain to really understand Bitcoin
[40:32] you know and then start to evangelize it
[40:34] within their Bank where they're already
[40:36] the most resistant because bitcoin's
[40:38] like basically like going after the
[40:40] banks right it's basically saying we
[40:41] don't need this middleman so H how do
[40:44] they you know they they're going to try
[40:47] to apply Fiat kind of like Concepts to
[40:52] create a Bitcoin bank and and I was
[40:54] listening to a conversation of the the
[40:56] the founder of Galo about this because
[40:58] he's building um open- Source kind of
[41:00] Bitcoin banking technology and and he
[41:02] was asked this similar question like you
[41:04] know what do you think is going to
[41:05] happen and uh you know he I think he
[41:08] kind of more sides on the same aspect of
[41:10] we're going to see the rise of Bitcoin
[41:12] Banks you know people that are are you
[41:14] know Bitcoin native from the start you
[41:17] know because they understand the user
[41:20] they understand the EOS system uh you
[41:22] know and they can grow faster whereas
[41:25] you know banks are lagard right they
[41:27] don't kind of they're not early adopters
[41:30] they're kind of like oh let's bolt on
[41:32] the Bitcoin to our existing thing you
[41:34] know and how do we bring it into our
[41:36] existing messy infrastructure of Fiat
[41:39] Technologies and so you know first mover
[41:43] Advantage you're right I think the river
[41:45] I I think you know those types of
[41:47] companies are the ones that are
[41:49] positioning themselves now as thought
[41:52] leaders and as the innovators in that
[41:55] space so I don't know you look in the
[41:58] States you know in the last what is it
[42:00] 10 years 500 some odd banks have gone
[42:02] belly up just in the us alone so to
[42:06] me I I don't know I think they'll
[42:08] continue to make mistakes and they'll
[42:10] you know those those will shut down
[42:13] maybe a Bitcoin bank will buy assets
[42:15] from you know those and shift people
[42:17] over but but I I think it's going to be
[42:18] newcomers I think it's going to be you
[42:20] know Bitcoin companies that rise you
[42:23] know ju again I'll go back to the
[42:24] bookstore thing you know it wasn't you
[42:27] know Craig's Corner bookstore that rose
[42:29] up and became the internet bookstore
[42:31] giant it was a new incumbent it was
[42:34] Amazon somebody that came in and said
[42:36] I'm gonna remodel your business in this
[42:40] new world you know in this new internet
[42:42] world so I think it's the same we're
[42:43] seeing with you know companies like
[42:46] River and others where they're just like
[42:47] you know we're going to look at the
[42:50] banking world and we're going to build
[42:52] you know on the on the Bitcoin standard
[42:54] from the
[42:55] beginning it's it's super interesting
[42:57] and uh never looked at the the data but
[43:00] like banks are really dying off I mean
[43:03] is
[43:04] already it's clear why like you don't
[43:07] need that many Bank especially you don't
[43:09] need the the physical Banks so so much
[43:12] but it it's kind of wow it's interesting
[43:14] never looked at that I look up here so
[43:18] we have um you know in Canada we have
[43:20] really just like the big five banks we
[43:22] have like which are really just
[43:24] extensions of our government like
[43:25] they're very tightly regulated
[43:27] you you know nobody can really start a
[43:29] new bank up here and then we have our
[43:31] credit union system which there's Credit
[43:33] Union system in the United States as
[43:34] well and these are more like Community
[43:36] Credit Unions where you know like you
[43:38] know there's even like some of these
[43:40] were started by like the fishermen on
[43:42] the west coast of Canada they all
[43:44] assembled and they created a credit
[43:45] union which is like a pseudo Bank you
[43:47] know and and they built a community you
[43:49] know around their finances but if you
[43:51] look at the credit union system over the
[43:53] last 20 years it's just been
[43:55] consolidating and consolidating
[43:57] consolidating because their margins are
[43:59] super thin and you know they can't keep
[44:03] up with technology like running a online
[44:06] banking app and an online banking
[44:08] website costs a lot of money and chews
[44:11] up a lot of margins from just you know
[44:13] earning mortgages and if we look at the
[44:15] last you know 10 years where interest
[44:17] rates were so low like Banks weren't or
[44:20] and Credit Unions weren't earning a lot
[44:22] of interest you know um you know
[44:24] interest rates has certainly changed but
[44:27] huge consolidations going on the bigger
[44:29] credit unions are buying up all the
[44:31] little ones you know and we're going
[44:32] from like hundreds of credit unions down
[44:34] to like you know 50 or so and and the
[44:37] trend will continue over the next
[44:39] probably another 20 years you know those
[44:42] financials institutions will shrink down
[44:44] to probably a few dozen because they're
[44:46] just the economies of scale are just not
[44:48] there for them so you know they're
[44:50] either getting bought out which is or or
[44:52] they're just getting kind of you know
[44:54] merged into a larger one and they they
[44:56] just just take over their members and
[44:58] their Holdings and and they dissolve
[45:00] that that small little Credit Union
[45:03] so yeah branches are yeah it's exactly
[45:07] like 2008 was the high point and it was
[45:10] basically going up since for the people
[45:13] that that that just listen um I
[45:16] basically pulled up a chart from
[45:18] 1934 where there are 3,000 uh Bank
[45:21] branches in the USA and it has been just
[45:25] going up like crazy since 20 eight where
[45:28] 80 what is it
[45:30] 82,000 Bank branches uh in the US and
[45:33] now since then it actually has fallen uh
[45:37] not not that dramatically but for
[45:39] physical Bank branches it's like it's
[45:41] not digital like you have to have a
[45:43] process for for turning those off so
[45:45] like there's a delayed
[45:46] process uh and this is just 2018 so it
[45:50] already has been eight more years it's
[45:53] probably like way lower now uh and it
[45:55] has gone down to 7
[45:57] 7,000 uh so it's a clear Trend and and
[46:01] probably we are right now maybe at like
[46:03] 60,000 or like 70,000 or something like
[46:05] that if I had to guess now uh this is a
[46:09] clear clear clear death of of the banks
[46:12] I never looked at that statistics really
[46:14] interesting because like the banks for
[46:15] me is is kind of the the enemy of
[46:19] Bitcoin yeah um you know something I I
[46:21] saw a lot of data too you know working
[46:23] in that the the banking system and you
[46:27] know the the credit unions is another
[46:29] interesting place where you know the the
[46:30] average age of the members of these
[46:32] Credit Unions you know is is the baby
[46:35] boomer generation right so I I think we
[46:37] see this trend you know as they kind of
[46:40] uh you know you know as they kind of
[46:43] like they're the ones that are driving
[46:45] the existing branches and all that like
[46:47] there they're still the people that go
[46:48] to the bank you know they're they're
[46:49] still reluctant a lot to use online
[46:52] banking you know major things they go to
[46:54] the branch and so I think you know
[46:57] as we see those Generations kind of
[46:59] shift uh you know we're going to see you
[47:01] know those branches and those banking
[47:03] kind of relationships you know go online
[47:06] and and again just become more
[47:08] selfservice right like that's the that's
[47:10] what you know Millennials genx even and
[47:14] you know younger you know it's all
[47:15] self-service you know same thing with
[47:18] Bitcoin right it's all about
[47:19] self-service so I think we'll see that
[47:21] Trend continue you know it's
[47:23] just it's it's it's just declining
[47:27] yeah how do you imagine Bitcoin scaling
[47:31] how do you think is like is self custody
[47:33] mainstream are we going on lightning
[47:35] fent how do you look at the the scaling
[47:39] and and the mass adoption of Bitcoin in
[47:40] that
[47:41] way yeah I think we're going to you know
[47:45] lightning is going to play a big role in
[47:46] that for sure um yeah I think you know
[47:49] self- custody will be a part of it um
[47:53] but but I also think you know like again
[47:55] like the galloy Bitcoin bank is somewhat
[47:58] of a custodial solution and I think you
[48:00] know the hardcore bitcoiners are going
[48:02] to be like you know can't custody
[48:04] anything but I think there's going to be
[48:06] some aspect where we're going to be you
[48:08] know there is going to be some custody
[48:10] kind of involved you know not
[48:13] everybody's going to be able to um you
[48:15] know Cold Storage their Bitcoin as much
[48:17] as we want that um you know not a lot of
[48:19] people have that much money to Cold
[48:21] Storage you know like you know a huge
[48:24] majority of the of the the global
[48:26] population lives paycheck to paycheck
[48:28] you know they don't have enough Bitcoin
[48:30] to steal right they're they're using
[48:33] money as you know I I got a little bit
[48:36] today I'm gonna go buy groceries and I'm
[48:38] gonna pay my rent and I got nothing left
[48:41] over and so you know I think lightning
[48:44] and some of these uh you know you know
[48:47] fedy mints and things like that you know
[48:49] these Community Banks where you know
[48:52] it's almost like the credit union system
[48:54] in a sense you know like that that model
[48:55] of community
[48:57] where you know people were like you know
[48:58] I don't want to go with the big bank I'm
[49:00] going to trust my little Community Bank
[49:02] because I know that you know Robin runs
[49:04] the the the bank and I know Robin
[49:06] because we you know we play on the same
[49:08] or you know with the same team or
[49:10] whatever you know so I
[49:11] think I think we'll see a bit more of
[49:13] that and I think that we'll see as as
[49:15] kind of onboarding where people will
[49:16] have somebody to hold their hand you
[49:18] know not everybody is self-driven you
[49:21] know bitcoiners are like you know I'll
[49:23] do it all myself you know I'm Sovereign
[49:26] I you know I have my Citadel and I'm you
[49:28] know I'm a oneman army right whereas you
[49:31] know we are creatures of community as
[49:35] human beings so I think Bitcoin brings
[49:38] these better checks and balances right
[49:41] like you know today we trust the banks
[49:43] but ideally they could do whatever they
[49:45] want whereas the you know Technologies
[49:48] like lightning all these things the
[49:49] traceability of Bitcoin you know um I
[49:53] think make it a little bit easier to
[49:55] trust maybe some
[49:57] you know communities or centralized
[49:59] custodial authorities so I I think we'll
[50:02] see that you know whether you know
[50:04] Bitcoin Maxis like it or not I think you
[50:07] know we're going to see it because it's
[50:09] gonna it's G to there'll be a value
[50:11] proposition for people and that will
[50:13] help things scale right again not
[50:15] everybody's going to have a ton of money
[50:17] to hold like there is so most people in
[50:21] the world live paycheck to paycheck like
[50:24] you know us in the Western World you
[50:26] know we have huge financial privilege
[50:28] where you know a lot of people in the
[50:31] world don't have that you know they they
[50:33] are they are not sitting on piles of
[50:35] money they're not earning piles of money
[50:38] so you know yeah I I think there's going
[50:40] to be a combination of things and that
[50:41] that'll help with scalability I think
[50:43] again bringing people on and you know
[50:46] you look at um the blink app which is in
[50:49] El Salvador like that's a custodial app
[50:52] right and so you know it works people
[50:55] use it they're using it in small values
[50:58] you know you're not they're not worried
[50:59] about getting you know $100 worth of
[51:02] bitcoin stolen you know and nobody's
[51:04] going to you know compromise that
[51:06] custodial relationship for that so I
[51:09] don't know it's going to be a balance I
[51:11] I I think you know that's going to help
[51:13] scale to some extent and bringing people
[51:14] on to feel more safe um you know having
[51:18] backup plans with a custodial kind of
[51:20] Bank you
[51:22] know you know may bring on a little bit
[51:25] more of the non-technical
[51:27] users you know into
[51:29] Bitcoin yeah and I do think also like
[51:33] collaborative custody could also be a a
[51:35] big part of the story or just like
[51:38] services in general uh that help you
[51:41] guide you through that process and then
[51:43] also like this is probably the way to go
[51:47] for the people that really want to be
[51:49] self Sovereign of either have
[51:51] collaborative custody or have like
[51:52] someone guiding you and then there's
[51:54] like this extreme guy that just like
[51:57] also wants to educate and do everything
[51:59] on its own like and don't want anyone to
[52:02] be involved uh and then for the other
[52:04] ones there's maybe a thing
[52:07] like how is it called bit key uh and and
[52:10] and and those kind of applications where
[52:12] it's really easy it's like an IOS app uh
[52:14] and then on the other side maybe there
[52:16] are people are just like hey I I I want
[52:19] to have it on Exchange which is which is
[52:21] fine I always encourage people
[52:23] especially now uh to to be as as as
[52:25] selfs so and as self- custody as
[52:27] possible but we also have to be aware of
[52:31] like the bitcoiner from 2012 is the
[52:34] average bitcoiner from 2012 is very
[52:36] different from the average bitcoiner in
[52:38] 2025 uh and is very different from the
[52:40] average bitcoiner in 2050 just because
[52:43] we get bigger the grow is different yeah
[52:46] I agree with that I definitely agree
[52:48] it's evolving constantly and uh yeah I I
[52:51] think we're going to have a lot of
[52:52] things you know I I've been reading a
[52:54] bit more about ecash and and you know
[52:57] these fedt and and I think there's
[52:58] something there you know it's definitely
[53:00] the Privacy aspect is coming back into
[53:02] it and so yeah there's going to be more
[53:05] services a and you're right the
[53:06] bitcoiners will evolve you know it's
[53:09] it's just the way it is you know so yeah
[53:12] I don't think you can really take a
[53:14] super hard line on it because it's
[53:16] something's got to we got to scale right
[53:18] and we got to bring more people on we
[53:20] got to get more to the you know medium
[53:22] of exchange and people using it and and
[53:24] I think we're still in the holding
[53:28] kind of phase of Bitcoin you know we are
[53:30] definitely still in the med in the in
[53:33] the store value phase it it's still
[53:35] getting adopted I think sometimes we
[53:38] lose sight of how early we are like go
[53:41] out on the street and ask 100 people uh
[53:44] how much money they have in Bitcoin uh
[53:46] and most of them say zero nothing and
[53:49] some of them might say what is bitcoin
[53:52] uh and maybe one or two persons are like
[53:54] oh like I have some money in Bitcoin
[53:56] Bitcoin is talking to each other is
[53:57] sometimes an echo chamber of and very
[54:00] far away from reality per yeah you know
[54:03] we we you're right we kind of live and
[54:04] breathe this we're very interested we're
[54:06] very early adopters you know but you're
[54:09] you're right it's it's just again I go
[54:12] back to our earlier conversation like
[54:13] these these things with what's going on
[54:15] with the the politics in the States you
[54:18] know it brings it into the social
[54:20] Discord makes people talk about it like
[54:22] why would the government even consider
[54:23] this like now I maybe I'm going to read
[54:25] about it maybe going to buy the Bitcoin
[54:27] standard now and kind of like why why
[54:30] would the government even consider this
[54:32] you know it starts to get people kind of
[54:33] thinking and asking those questions so
[54:36] yeah we're so early you know there's a
[54:38] lot of a lot of education required and
[54:40] and it's complex money is complex
[54:42] Bitcoin is complex this why I always say
[54:45] it's going to take generations to change
[54:47] this you know it's going to take you
[54:49] know you know my my my kids who are you
[54:51] know twins you know are are still you
[54:55] know they're learning about it they're
[54:56] curious about it but they're going to
[54:57] grow up you know around this earlier
[55:01] than most people will right so it's
[55:04] going to take these generations to kind
[55:05] of really understand it and um you know
[55:08] it's the same with the internet like I
[55:10] look at my mom who's in her 70s you know
[55:12] and she know you know the internet to
[55:13] her is Facebook and messages and YouTube
[55:18] like that's what the internet is to to
[55:19] that generation you know and and what's
[55:23] the internet to my kids is way different
[55:26] you know like they're they've grown up
[55:27] on a on a digital world so to me those
[55:30] are the changes that it takes right it's
[55:32] like those younger Generations are more
[55:34] comfortable with digital transactions
[55:37] because they played Roblox and they
[55:38] traded you know roo you know with their
[55:41] friends online and so I never did that
[55:43] as a kid and my parents never did that
[55:46] as a kid but my kids are are are trading
[55:49] you know internet magic money in these
[55:51] games you know as young young children
[55:55] and so you know that's going to have a
[55:57] huge impact when they start to enter the
[55:58] real world you know and and start to be
[56:01] like how do I make money and what is
[56:02] money and and all those things so yeah
[56:06] we're super
[56:08] early and for them U digital money will
[56:11] be so second nature like it will be so
[56:14] natural for them they like ah of course
[56:16] my money is digital why would I have
[56:18] something physical like that's so
[56:20] inconvenient yeah yeah I also think
[56:22] what's interesting on that too like them
[56:24] knowing digital money like I I watched
[56:26] my kids when they play Roblox and stuff
[56:28] like that and some of these games like
[56:31] you know the money that they're dealing
[56:33] with is massive like they they'll be
[56:35] building a store and and they're they're
[56:36] dealing with like higher numbers and and
[56:40] I kind of talk about this in terms of
[56:41] like Satoshi you know and like 100
[56:44] million you know Satoshi in a Bitcoin
[56:46] like like we you know when I grew up we
[56:49] talked in $1 $2 Five Doll $10 like we
[56:52] never thought about millions and
[56:54] billions and that like it just wasn't
[56:56] those numbers as it relates to money
[56:58] were just way out there whereas these
[57:01] kids they're like oh you know I run this
[57:03] pizza shop and the pizza shop I've made
[57:05] you know $30 million in my pizza shop
[57:08] you know like their their their unit of
[57:11] their unit kind of understanding is way
[57:14] higher if that makes sense so like you
[57:16] know when they start to go like oh how
[57:17] much is this coffee oh it's 5,000
[57:20] Satoshi for a coffee right because it's
[57:23] five bucks like you know I see it as $5
[57:26] they're that whole concept of them going
[57:28] oh yeah I'll buy a coffee for 5,000
[57:29] Satoshi and my mom would be like 5,000
[57:32] wow that's expensive it's like no that's
[57:35] the equivalent of five bucks like that
[57:37] that unit kind
[57:39] of Paradigm is Shifting for them right
[57:42] because these games operate in in such a
[57:45] higher they use the big numbers you know
[57:48] so I found that to be interesting I
[57:49] think that will help with the shift
[57:51] where they're it's just going to be
[57:52] normal for them you know like when you
[57:54] start to want to price things in Bitcoin
[57:56] you know for us we're converting you
[57:59] know we're still Fiat minded where we're
[58:00] like 5,000 is five bucks whereas you
[58:03] know they're going to be
[58:05] like it's it's 5,000 set hosis right
[58:07] they're just going to understand that
[58:09] kind of unit of account rather than
[58:12] having to convert to what the Fiat
[58:13] equivalent is so again Generations it's
[58:16] going to take time absolutely um one
[58:19] other topic that you you brought up uh
[58:21] maybe there an exit top it here um how
[58:24] do you look at Nostra uh and and do you
[58:27] use it a lot do do you see a big
[58:29] potential in it I definitely do I'm
[58:31] actually doing a talk at our meetup on
[58:34] Monday about Noster for beginners and so
[58:38] um I always like to say this I think I
[58:39] heard this in one of the somebody else's
[58:41] talk was like you know Bitcoin is you
[58:45] know is not controlled by anybody and it
[58:48] works right it's money that nobody
[58:50] controls and it works and Noster is like
[58:53] uh you know a network that nobody
[58:55] controls a communication Network that
[58:57] nobody controls but it works and so you
[59:00] know right now we're seeing uh like
[59:04] Noster it's really about relays right
[59:05] it's a
[59:06] decentralized uh protocol uh like a
[59:09] messaging protocol that basically you
[59:11] know you have a whole bunch of nodes out
[59:13] there and like when you post a message
[59:15] or a piece of content you know it's
[59:16] posted to all these nodes right and the
[59:18] idea is like oh hey you know someone can
[59:21] go and and take down one of the nodes
[59:23] but my message is already on all these
[59:25] other nodes
[59:26] right so it's like you can't censor it
[59:28] um and nobody's kind of in in charge of
[59:30] it there's no centralized kind of
[59:32] authority so I think there's huge
[59:35] parallels to Bitcoin in the self
[59:36] sovereignty in the you know
[59:39] permissionless um you know it's about
[59:41] having a digital identity that you own
[59:43] and that's portable right so I could you
[59:45] know it works off of um you know public
[59:48] and private keys my public key is like
[59:51] my username and my private key is my
[59:54] password and I can take that identity
[59:57] with me anywhere so I can log into a
[59:59] variety of applications and that
[60:02] identity that's and all the stuff I've
[60:04] done and all
[60:06] the communication and notes and
[60:08] information that I've posted on relays
[60:10] can now be accessed you know from
[60:12] whatever app anywhere so I think it's
[60:15] hugely powerful in that regard um you
[60:18] know it's taking again same ethos as
[60:20] Bitcoin where it's the power is going
[60:22] back to the people you know I'm going to
[60:24] control my digital identity and my
[60:26] digital content whereas today we live in
[60:28] a world where Google and apple and you
[60:31] know everybody else controls your your
[60:33] digital identity they can turn it off
[60:36] they can delete you um they can restrict
[60:38] you and all those things so Noster
[60:41] really right now the main focus has
[60:43] really been on kind of like an X or a
[60:45] Twitter esque kind of platform where you
[60:48] know micro blogging you know I'm posting
[60:50] you know content and you know it's out
[60:54] there they've adopted or kind of brought
[60:56] Bitcoin into it where now and integrated
[60:59] lightning into it where you can you know
[61:01] instead of just giving a heart to
[61:02] somebody or or a thumbs up you can zap
[61:05] them Satoshi and you can send them one
[61:07] Satoshi or a thousand or 100,000 Satoshi
[61:11] and it's instant and so I really like
[61:14] that from our you know our heavily
[61:17] addicted social media Society I think
[61:20] you know who's you know everybody's an
[61:22] influencer I think you know we're in the
[61:24] early days where where you know
[61:28] influencers can start to remove the
[61:30] middleman right like you you right now
[61:33] you're when you're putting something
[61:34] something out on YouTube you know an
[61:37] Advertiser has to spend money with
[61:39] YouTube and then you're doing you know
[61:41] your content creation and then YouTube's
[61:43] giving you a fraction of that for your
[61:45] creation you know like you're talking
[61:47] about Bitcoin and hopefully advertisers
[61:50] are showing up on your videos and you're
[61:52] getting a portion of that so that's how
[61:54] you you know influences are earning
[61:56] their income on YouTube on Tik Tok on X
[61:59] you know on Facebook whereas Noster it's
[62:02] like I can go and post a meme on there
[62:04] right now and if somebody likes it they
[62:07] can give me 10 Satoshi and it goes into
[62:09] my lightning wallet and now I have that
[62:11] value Noster doesn't get a share it's
[62:14] peer-to-peer
[62:16] um you know peer-to-peer relationships
[62:19] with between influencers and and the the
[62:22] consumer of that content um same thing
[62:25] on Fountain I if you put this on the
[62:26] fountain app where you you you run pod
[62:29] you know your podcasts same thing if
[62:31] someone likes your podcast you
[62:33] know you can just pay them directly or
[62:37] and you're you're basically having that
[62:38] peer-to-peer
[62:39] transaction uh of value for Value so I
[62:43] think that you know nosters really
[62:45] taking that I guess and and pushing that
[62:47] and I think more people come to Noster
[62:50] for that right they're kind of like oh
[62:51] wow I can get paid directly and you're
[62:54] again removing the third party out of
[62:56] the influencer model which I think is
[62:59] very attractive but again super early
[63:01] days there's not a lot of people you
[63:04] know big influencers on there it's very
[63:06] Bitcoin very developer very open- Source
[63:08] kind of focused but I I I think that's
[63:11] evolving like there's people have made
[63:14] Instagram uh replicas like anything
[63:16] could be built on if you think about
[63:18] social media you know um they built like
[63:21] Noster nests which is like um um like a
[63:25] x spes or Twitter spaces kind of thing
[63:27] or The Clubhouse kind of model same
[63:29] thing you can zap people that are in
[63:31] those conversations and so I I think
[63:34] that's a really interesting business
[63:36] model A really interesting kind of uh
[63:39] use case that will bring more people
[63:41] into Bitcoin because they're going to
[63:43] get the value now I've got these Satoshi
[63:45] what do I do with it what is bitcoin you
[63:47] know it starts to again bring that
[63:49] Discord and it and it comes at it from
[63:51] not a a money place like hey read the
[63:53] Bitcoin standard learn about money get
[63:56] off of Fiat it's more like hey you know
[63:59] you're paying a whole bunch of money to
[64:01] YouTube and you know you could have all
[64:04] that value to yourself so I think that
[64:06] that's really exciting to me and and
[64:08] we're really early days Noster is only a
[64:10] few years old you know and it's getting
[64:12] huge um you know Jack dorsy is really
[64:16] pushing for it you know he's uh been
[64:18] investing in it the guy that uh Fiat
[64:21] jaff that started Noster and wrote the
[64:23] protocol like he got like 14 Bitcoin
[64:25] start developing this and we're seeing
[64:27] now like the Primal app and and you know
[64:29] people building you know clients for
[64:32] this and even people building um relays
[64:36] um the guy that was uh the developer
[64:38] that built
[64:39] ndless um like a lightning um SAS
[64:42] product that got shut down by the
[64:44] Canadian government he moved over to
[64:45] Noster and now he's building relays and
[64:48] you know it's this world of like you
[64:51] know again it's it's a new technology
[64:53] stack that is fully like ready to use
[64:56] Bitcoin as as its kind of medium of
[64:59] exchange so I don't know it's very
[65:00] exciting to me I think there's a lot of
[65:02] cool things going on there interesting
[65:05] yeah for me as a greater the biggest
[65:07] thing is actually the
[65:09] interoperability of it where um imagine
[65:14] you come on YouTube and you get a reply
[65:17] and I I I write back to them then I open
[65:20] Twitter and then I have the same threat
[65:23] there and I can reply back there uh and
[65:25] it's all like one protocol in one
[65:28] network and it's just different clients
[65:31] to that which is really big uh for me as
[65:33] a grader because as a grader you always
[65:35] go through the hustle like you have five
[65:38] notification lists you have five places
[65:40] where you have to upload a video you
[65:42] have five it's it's really um
[65:46] mindboggling of like like I have to be
[65:48] here and here and here and here and here
[65:50] and it's like okay I want to have one
[65:52] thing and and if you have Noster you can
[65:55] focus on like one client if you don't
[65:58] like this client anymore just switch on
[66:00] to another client but you don't lose the
[66:03] followers you don't lose the the history
[66:06] you don't lose anything uh and this for
[66:09] me is uh the biggest Advantage the
[66:13] openness and the interoperability of the
[66:16] nostal protocol um of course it's great
[66:19] that we can also sap each other and and
[66:21] and have the censorship resistance uh
[66:24] but what I think will bring a lot of
[66:26] people in there is the openness because
[66:28] all of a sudden uh what what if Twitter
[66:31] tomorrow decides yeah let's let's also
[66:34] plug in Nostra like he can have Twitter
[66:37] TW x uh the same way it works right now
[66:41] and just plug into nost
[66:43] also uh and has more content uh and this
[66:47] kind of network effect and Game Theory
[66:50] uh is really interesting because I
[66:52] always think of like okay why should
[66:54] people adopt it because most people
[66:56] don't get banned on social media like
[66:58] most people don't go go through that
[67:00] that that hardship because most people
[67:02] just consume like 99% of people just
[67:05] consume on the on the social medias uh
[67:08] so so I'm really I'm really looking
[67:10] forward to to Nostra and the
[67:12] developments are going fast but it's
[67:14] still so super so so so so early uh in
[67:18] that regard like 10 years earlier than
[67:21] than Bitcoin
[67:22] is yeah I agree you're right you know
[67:24] you're talking about like the digital
[67:25] identity you take with you you know and
[67:28] it was interesting when I as I play with
[67:29] new apps and stuff like that you're
[67:31] right how your content like everything
[67:33] comes with you you know like I was like
[67:35] oh I'll check out I think it's called
[67:36] Olaf it's like the Instagram replica you
[67:40] know and and I logged into that you know
[67:42] I I bring over my public key and and my
[67:44] private key and I get into that and it's
[67:46] like all my content's already there now
[67:48] it's formatted in an Instagram view so
[67:50] it's like instead of me like okay I've
[67:52] been posting on you know uh you know on
[67:56] on Twitter and all of that and it's like
[67:58] oh I'm now going to create uh I've been
[68:00] posting images there I go over to this
[68:02] new platform all my content's already
[68:04] there so those that are on you know the
[68:06] clients and the or the the consumers
[68:08] that are on that Olas app you know
[68:10] instantly have all my content from my
[68:13] other apps right it's just reformatted
[68:15] in an Instagram kind of view right and
[68:17] so they're just looking at all the
[68:18] images I posted so you're right I think
[68:21] that whole
[68:22] interoperability and and the digital
[68:24] identity of being able to take your
[68:26] content to whatever platform I I think
[68:28] we're going to see really cool
[68:29] development in that space right where
[68:31] where we're going to start to combine
[68:33] all these you know the Tik toks and the
[68:35] Instagram and the and the the Twitter
[68:37] and all these things will just you know
[68:39] combine into new platforms that that
[68:42] yeah will just be very interesting so
[68:45] yeah it's going to be interesting uh you
[68:47] know it's it's very early days you know
[68:49] it's very clunky you know the the
[68:51] websites and the clients are are still
[68:53] in that you you know early development
[68:56] phase but but it's fascinating I love it
[68:58] that's where to me that's Cutting Edge
[69:00] stuff and and it's really interesting to
[69:02] see where it's going really cool um I
[69:05] asked now I think it didn't do it uh
[69:08] when you first time were here I think it
[69:10] was something that developed late in the
[69:12] podcast I asked now every guest of mine
[69:15] uh what can we learn from you besides
[69:17] Bitcoin that's a good question um yeah
[69:21] well um what can we learn um yeah I'm uh
[69:25] well I'm a
[69:26] dad I've got three kids um I live way up
[69:30] in the north in Manitoba I'm in Canada
[69:33] and it's um very cold here um yeah what
[69:37] else can you learn you know I've been in
[69:39] tech for a long time I've been
[69:41] passionate about technology since like
[69:43] the the late 90s is when I really kind
[69:45] of dove into things um you know really
[69:48] love that I'm a snowboarder uh I'm a
[69:51] mountain biker when I can get out to the
[69:53] mountains uh and I just love to go uh on
[69:56] adventures I love to camp and get out
[69:58] into the Wilderness so I'm a big nature
[70:00] guy you know when I'm not in in the tech
[70:01] world I just want to be disconnected and
[70:05] out in nature so um you know that's just
[70:07] I'm a regular guy you know that just you
[70:09] know loves Bitcoin loves his family and
[70:12] you know just wants to kind of you know
[70:15] do good in the world so I love that yeah
[70:18] that's that that's great um I we have
[70:21] end in the podcast as you know uh where
[70:24] the previous guest is asking a question
[70:25] question for the next guest without
[70:26] knowing who the next guest is and the
[70:28] previous guest asked you the question uh
[70:30] I have to Define one word for you after
[70:33] after the question but do you think fat
[70:35] will go away and he is defining fat as
[70:40] not the currency but the way of life
[70:43] will Fiat go away I think this ties into
[70:45] the conversation we had earlier I I
[70:47] think it's
[70:49] it's it's going to be relegated to
[70:52] museums and collector memorability
[70:55] I think you know I I think we will
[70:57] evolve you know like just like the horse
[70:59] and carriage people still like to jump
[71:01] on a horse and go riding through the
[71:03] woods and maybe you know at Christmas
[71:05] time they're pulling people around in a
[71:07] in a sleigh like some things never go
[71:09] away but but I think we're going to
[71:11] evolve and and I think you know
[71:13] technology changes you know
[71:16] like you know just like cash hasn't gone
[71:19] fully away we've got debit cards and
[71:21] credit cards but cash is still there
[71:23] these things take time so I don't think
[71:24] it'll
[71:25] completely vanish from our world um but
[71:30] but it but it will we're definitely
[71:31] going to take a big dent out of it in
[71:33] the next hundred
[71:34] years absolutely really cool um thank
