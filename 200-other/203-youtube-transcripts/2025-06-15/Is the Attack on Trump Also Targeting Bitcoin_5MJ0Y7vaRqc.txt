[00:00] a front runner for the presidency of the
[00:01] United States is speaking positively
[00:03] about Bitcoin when even just like two
[00:04] years ago that would have been
[00:06] completely inconceivable and unheard of
[00:08] but now it's the reality that we're
[00:09] living in I opened up my ex and then
[00:11] posts like 5 minutes ago were like
[00:13] Donald Trump was just shot at at a rally
[00:15] in Pennsylvania he's going to be pissed
[00:17] off and he's definitely going to use
[00:19] this they've created this Boogeyman out
[00:21] of him what he was convicted for it just
[00:23] seems absurd on the face of it just like
[00:26] o an accounting error that's what we're
[00:28] going to charge the former president for
[00:30] to keep them from running for office the
[00:31] election at this point it is a reality
[00:33] TV show it's like the same dramatic
[00:34] flare as professional wrestling Joe
[00:36] Biden cannot be president I don't think
[00:38] he has the the cognizant power to
[00:41] actually be in charge of running a
[00:42] country who was it and what was the
[00:44] intentions I don't even want to consider
[00:46] what would have happened if that was
[00:47] actually successful yesterday he's going
[00:49] to use that as his big campaign slogans
[00:51] it's just like they can't take me
[00:56] out well it's not unusual for uh yeah
[01:00] for for leaders that start talking about
[01:04] changing the financial rails to be put
[01:09] in the crosshairs So it's talking about
[01:11] positively about Bitcoin and negatively
[01:14] about cbdcs especially when there's
[01:17] strong forces that that that want the
[01:20] opposite of what he's saying yeah it's
[01:22] it's not unusual for them to uh take out
[01:25] their opposition so I don't know what
[01:28] happened exactly and I can have yeah I
[01:30] have all kinds of crazy assumptions but
[01:32] yeah that was a wild event yesterday
[01:34] afternoon yeah this this was really
[01:35] crazy yeah let's let's di right into it
[01:38] um um before we cover like what what
[01:40] happened yesterday or like depends on on
[01:42] where you live even today um it's like
[01:46] the first podcast I record now after
[01:48] after the the shot of trump uh and uh
[01:52] it's it's crazy to me how how big of a
[01:54] wave this makes and and we can talk
[01:56] about that but before that like what was
[01:59] your current like before that what what
[02:01] was the current image of trump and how
[02:03] do you see him uh heading up to the
[02:06] Bitcoin conference heading up to the do
[02:09] like a winning election basically and
[02:11] and winning the being the first pro
[02:14] Bitcoin uh candidate the first pro
[02:17] Bitcoin presidential candidate that
[02:19] actually has a really good chance of
[02:21] winning probably will
[02:23] win yeah well whether he's doing it
[02:25] pandering for votes or whether he's
[02:28] genuinely taking an interest in Bitcoin
[02:30] and believes that it can be beneficial
[02:32] to the American economy like that
[02:34] doesn't really matter like the fact that
[02:37] a front runner for the presidency of the
[02:38] United States is speaking positively
[02:40] about Bitcoin when even just like two
[02:42] years ago that would have been
[02:43] completely inconceivable and unheard of
[02:46] but now it's the reality that we're
[02:47] living in and that's kind of sends a
[02:50] signal to many other world leaders that
[02:54] this is this is a technology that's not
[02:56] going away and your choice is either to
[02:59] deny it use in your jurisdictions or to
[03:02] embrace it and we're going to see a lot
[03:04] of interesting game theory play out
[03:05] around that idea of just whether who who
[03:09] who Embraces it is going to potentially
[03:13] have such an asymmetric Advantage with
[03:16] with the properties that Bitcoin carries
[03:18] with it as like as collateral as as
[03:20] payment rails yeah I'm just looking
[03:23] forward to just seeing the next steps of
[03:27] of like who who kind of starts coming
[03:29] out embracing this technology like we
[03:31] know that there's like there's a few
[03:33] others like we've got bu who's very
[03:35] positively Pro Bitcoin I don't know if
[03:37] you had a chance to speak with uh Maya
[03:39] parbo from Surinam but she she seems
[03:42] like she's got a pretty good probability
[03:44] of of winning the Cam's election and she
[03:47] has very clearly spoken that she will
[03:50] Embrace Bitcoin as part of her policy
[03:52] and I've actually spoken with her a
[03:54] little bit she's very positive on
[03:55] nuclear power as well so that'll be a
[03:58] very very good um up like interesting uh
[04:02] turn of events for another South
[04:05] American country and then on back to
[04:07] Salvador like the last week when they
[04:09] announced that they are starting the
[04:11] process of creating a nuclear power
[04:15] industry in their country that was a a
[04:17] huge development as well because now the
[04:20] Bitcoin country also is embracing one of
[04:22] the most powerful energy generation
[04:24] technologies that we have
[04:26] so they can kind of be the front runner
[04:29] on what it may look like for nuclear
[04:32] power to be developed inside of a
[04:34] Bitcoin standard in instead of in a Fiat
[04:36] standard because some of the the
[04:38] research I've done recently a lot of the
[04:42] negative headwinds against nuclear power
[04:44] started in the 7s and as bitcoiners we
[04:47] are very much aware that uh 1971 the US
[04:51] dollar was completely untethered from
[04:52] any tie to gold and basically real
[04:55] energy in the world and that uh gave in
[04:59] interesting change of of how energy
[05:02] systems are financed so now everything
[05:04] that's financed with debt that doesn't
[05:06] really Jive well with a with nuclear
[05:10] power that requires a very longtime
[05:12] Horizon to to plan it and consider it so
[05:16] it needs a lot different structure that
[05:19] yeah this the Fiat system doesn't really
[05:20] align with and if you look at the chart
[05:22] in the United States of nuclear power
[05:25] plant construction permits being issued
[05:27] it just flatlines in 1975 and then also
[05:31] um just Rec looking at just recent other
[05:35] yeah recently I was looking at other
[05:37] influences around that time that started
[05:39] to gain a lot of power over the
[05:42] narrative especially the anti-nuclear
[05:44] narrative that was in like 1971 is when
[05:47] Greenpeace was formed 1972 was when
[05:49] Sierra Club flipped from being
[05:51] pro-nuclear to anti-nuclear the the nrdc
[05:54] also was instituted around that same
[05:56] time and they're very anti-nuclear so
[05:58] it's very interesting to see see a lot
[06:00] of the the um the players that had a
[06:03] strong anti-nuclear position gained a
[06:07] significant amount of influence in the
[06:08] 70s so even before Three Mile Island
[06:11] happened there was many negative
[06:13] headwinds pushing nuclear power down in
[06:16] the markets and then Three Mile Island
[06:18] happened and then it kind of capped off
[06:20] and and killed what little what momentum
[06:22] there was and then and then even though
[06:25] it started to recover again in the 80s
[06:27] then Chernobyl happened and then that
[06:29] set it back back a little while and then
[06:30] it was starting to recover again and
[06:31] there was a lot of positive sentiment
[06:33] towards nuclear power in the early 2000s
[06:36] and then that kind of got derailed
[06:38] partially from the the financial crisis
[06:40] that happened and then also Fukushima
[06:42] kind of capped that off and then nuclear
[06:44] power has been in a pretty bad uh bare
[06:47] market for the last 10 12 years and then
[06:50] around two years ago like roughly when
[06:52] uh when Russia invaded in Ukraine that
[06:55] put a lot more of these countries
[06:57] thinking about their energy sovereignty
[06:59] and reliant on external um players for
[07:03] for their energy resources so anybody
[07:05] that was reliant on getting fuel that
[07:07] was coming from a potential adversarial
[07:10] nation is now in a position where they
[07:12] have to figure out a new strategy or new
[07:15] new options for how they get they're
[07:16] going to have secure their energy
[07:18] resources and and it made it clear like
[07:21] being reliant on someone that's a
[07:22] potential adversary is bad and like even
[07:25] being reliant on allies is is a risk in
[07:28] this this day and age so it's so a lot
[07:31] more of these nations are starting to
[07:32] look towards nuclear power as a
[07:34] potential solution to secure their
[07:35] energy sovereignty because you the the
[07:38] fuel is so dense that you can keep
[07:40] decades worth of fuel resources on site
[07:44] and not have to worry about like
[07:46] constantly bringing in natural gas to
[07:47] power your plants or constantly re re uh
[07:51] supplying your coal piles at your coal
[07:52] plants like it's nuclear power just it's
[07:55] it's in a category of its own with how
[07:58] much power it can generate over how a
[08:00] significant amount of time so it's it's
[08:03] very refreshing to see that there's a
[08:06] lot of pro-nuclear sentiment in the
[08:08] world basically it's like Germany
[08:09] Austria Spain Australia are like the
[08:13] four countries that are still vehemently
[08:15] anti-nuclear and like almost everyone in
[08:17] the rest of the world is like we want
[08:19] nuclear power and we want it as soon as
[08:20] possible like even in in the United
[08:22] States Trump's pronuclear and then so is
[08:24] the Democrat Party they just passed the
[08:26] advance act last week in a very
[08:28] bipartisan support
[08:30] and then in Canada we've got the the
[08:32] Liberals are showing pronuclear and and
[08:34] the conservatives are also trying to say
[08:35] like we're even more pronuclear so it
[08:38] definitely looks like it's going to be a
[08:39] positive future for the development of
[08:41] nuclear power except we need to
[08:43] reinvigorate a lot of what was lost in
[08:46] those bare Market years when they
[08:47] weren't attracting as much like human
[08:49] capital into the industry and as much
[08:51] like just like liquid Capital to to
[08:53] finance these things so it's there's
[08:56] there's definitely challenges to
[08:57] overcome but it's uh nothing that we
[08:59] can't
[09:00] accomplish I love to see here and it's
[09:03] definitely like Germany Austria like
[09:05] where where I live like nuclear power is
[09:08] like oh no no we should not do like that
[09:10] that's like uh one of this topics even
[09:12] when you bring it up it's like this this
[09:15] mainstream no no no no don't don't talk
[09:17] about no no no that's that's not good uh
[09:19] I mean there are like some groups where
[09:21] you can actually discuss it and and
[09:23] where like they actually have like good
[09:25] opinions on that and there of course Al
[09:27] a few Pro uh
[09:30] nuclear Even parties and and political
[09:32] parties and people here uh so it's not
[09:35] all bad uh but yeah I can I can feel
[09:37] that like being in that real that it's
[09:40] it's not that not that uh well discussed
[09:44] as it might be somewhere else um also
[09:47] like uh because you mention Maya yes I
[09:49] actually interviewed her like I think
[09:51] three months ago even like two months
[09:53] ago we have that if if someone wants to
[09:55] check it out it's on my channel just
[09:57] search for Maya uh it's she's only Maya
[10:00] on my channel so you will you will find
[10:02] her uh and yeah it's it's it's crazy how
[10:05] how the president and the political
[10:08] force all of the sudden comes into
[10:10] Bitcoin comes into this uh realm of
[10:13] Bitcoin Bitcoin mining also a few now
[10:15] nuclear energy and and kind of takes a
[10:19] positive approach to that I think that's
[10:22] that's fascinating like who would have
[10:24] thought like just just two years ago
[10:27] that the uh leading candidate of America
[10:31] uh for the upcoming presidential
[10:33] election is for Bitcoin and speaking at
[10:36] the bit main Bitcoin only conference in
[10:39] Nashville I mean Bitcoin only like you
[10:42] mean get derailed by yesterday's events
[10:45] but yeah yeah I really hope so like I
[10:48] really hope that he still can come like
[10:50] that would be great and we talked about
[10:52] it before I heard that the next week's
[10:55] plans are already confirmed and then he
[10:57] will do the same as as plan
[11:00] um but before we let get into all the
[11:02] other topics um how was that when you
[11:05] heard it it it was probably yesterday
[11:07] because for you it's now morning so
[11:09] yesterday it happened for you right yeah
[11:11] yeah in my time I it was about 3 in the
[11:13] afternoon 4 in the afternoon and yeah I
[11:15] was just watching a movie with my family
[11:17] and then I opened up my ex and then post
[11:19] like five minutes ago or like Donald
[11:21] Trump was just shot at at at a r in
[11:23] Pennsylvania and then from there it was
[11:25] just like who's what what motivation
[11:27] would be behind that who like did did it
[11:30] cause any significant damage what what
[11:33] other casualties were there because it
[11:34] does look like there was at least two
[11:36] fatalities involved in the event but uh
[11:38] and yeah as far as I can tell Donald
[11:40] Trump's gonna have a pretty cool looking
[11:42] scar across his face and he's going to
[11:45] be pissed off and he's definitely going
[11:48] to use this as uh as part of his
[11:51] rhetoric going forward challenging the
[11:53] people that did oppose him and probably
[11:55] the rhetoric that led to this event
[11:57] because the there's been some pretty
[12:00] extreme talking points comparing him to
[12:02] some of the worst people in history but
[12:04] like I don't I don't see it I I don't
[12:07] know it seems like they've they've
[12:09] created this Boogeyman out of him
[12:12] and and they yeah they now they're like
[12:15] scared of this own this this image that
[12:17] they created for themselves like it's
[12:19] hard hard to describe like like I got
[12:21] issues with the guy like with some of
[12:24] his policy but it seems like most of the
[12:26] things they get obsessed about the
[12:27] people that hate the guy are completely
[12:30] nonsensical like all these if if he's so
[12:34] easy to go after then why make up silly
[12:39] things like the like the bleach thing
[12:41] why make up silly things about him
[12:43] saying things that he didn't actually
[12:45] say if if you just extend the clip by
[12:47] like 30 seconds it's completely
[12:49] different frame so there's plenty to
[12:52] criticize the guy about but it it just
[12:53] seems pathetic when those are the most
[12:56] aggressively pushed reasons to
[13:00] to like deny this this guy the ability
[13:02] to actually like run for presidency and
[13:04] like the the what he was convicted for
[13:06] it just seems absurd on on the face of
[13:09] it just like oh an an accounting error
[13:11] that's what we're going to charge the
[13:13] the former president for to keep them
[13:15] from running for office like it just it
[13:16] just seems it's sad really like just go
[13:21] head-to-head in a fair fight and let's
[13:23] see who can duke it out like I'm almost
[13:24] to the mind like put these guys in like
[13:26] a big brother or Survivor type of
[13:28] scenario and like actually like have
[13:30] have them compete in a re an actual
[13:32] reality TV show because the election at
[13:34] this point it is a reality TV show it's
[13:36] like the same dramatic flare as
[13:38] professional wrestling it's like just
[13:40] drop all the pretenses and let's just
[13:42] run it like a reality TV show because I
[13:45] don't know what else we can do at this
[13:47] point it is just turned into a circus
[13:49] yeah it's h it's it's a clro definitely
[13:53] like it's it's
[13:54] something uh that entertains it's
[13:56] something that you get emotional about
[13:58] it not something that helps you decide
[14:01] um like I watched the debate between
[14:04] those two I think like two weeks ago or
[14:06] something like
[14:08] that yeah and my main takeaway was like
[14:12] Joe Biden cannot be president not
[14:14] because of any um thing that he said but
[14:19] as he talks as he like he's not fit
[14:22] enough for presidency like for me it's
[14:25] it's clear and it was clear before like
[14:27] it's like all of the news like oh
[14:29] he's like a lot of newspapers thought
[14:32] like did like it's a news that it just
[14:35] came up now that Joe Biden is is not
[14:37] that fit and and there's so many
[14:39] speeches of him there are so many um
[14:42] wanders offs where he completely wanded
[14:44] off in in the middle of the crowd so
[14:46] like it's it's fascinating for me to see
[14:50] that like they're just parading this
[14:53] poor old man around just because he's a
[14:56] perfect empty suit that will just sign
[14:58] Whatever Gets gets put in front of him
[15:00] like I I don't think he has the the
[15:02] cognizant power to actually be in charge
[15:06] of running a country there's there's
[15:08] definitely people that want to keep him
[15:10] in place because he is just the perfect
[15:12] empty suit for them it's sad that it's
[15:14] come to that but this is this is where
[15:16] what we have to deal with in 2024 and
[15:18] hopefully we can move past this circus
[15:20] and in in the future we we will have
[15:24] more impressive leaders and the our our
[15:26] leadership class right now is not very
[15:30] impressive and that's also kind of one
[15:32] of the things that worries me is like we
[15:33] just had an assassination attempt
[15:35] against a potential president of the
[15:36] United States and at the same time
[15:39] leadership around across like the whole
[15:41] spectrum is
[15:42] pretty not uh not high quality so which
[15:47] Echoes similar situation to 1914 around
[15:51] that time when there was a lot of lot of
[15:52] leadership that could be argued was not
[15:54] the most competent and then they were
[15:56] very reactionary to event that happened
[15:58] and then that spiral out of control into
[16:00] World War I so I I very much worry that
[16:02] an event like this could provoke a wider
[16:05] wider um actions that somebody somebody
[16:09] could become very reactionary to it and
[16:11] do something even stupider and then that
[16:13] can be provocative to to some other
[16:15] party and like I I hope it doesn't
[16:17] spiral out of control and things can can
[16:19] calm down and we can get through this
[16:21] election without any more uh insanity
[16:23] but uh yeah it doesn't show any signs of
[16:26] slowing down like every every other week
[16:28] there's just something new that's crazy
[16:30] in this world what's your favorite uh or
[16:32] like your most probable uh theory that
[16:36] who was it and what was the intentions I
[16:38] don't know it was either someone that
[16:40] was deranged by all of the the the Trump
[16:42] is Hitler rhetoric and and really like
[16:44] believed it that they were doing
[16:46] something for the greater good or like
[16:49] it's not unfeasible that it was a py
[16:51] because we It's Not Unusual for for
[16:54] intelligence agencies to find somebody
[16:56] that's mentally ill and type them up to
[16:59] to perform an event like this so it's
[17:01] it's tough to say and like I I I hope
[17:04] that it was something that can be
[17:07] contained and is not going to escalate
[17:09] but I really really don't want to see
[17:12] any more of this in in this election
[17:14] because holy crap that could uh set set
[17:17] us up for a a very very bad next few
[17:21] years if uh if the potential president
[17:23] of the United States actually was
[17:24] assassinated like I could I don't even
[17:26] want to consider what would have
[17:28] happened if that was actually successful
[17:30] yesterday that's uh that would have been
[17:34] uh way bigger I think that would have
[17:36] been that would have been something
[17:39] undescribable honestly um because all of
[17:42] the past like like 911 uh RFK like all
[17:46] of the things like they were kind of in
[17:48] the past for me um or I was too young
[17:51] for that so it's it's it's interesting
[17:52] for me to like live such an event in an
[17:55] actual uh real life where I'm engaged
[17:58] where I I know all the things on the
[18:01] internet and and can see all the things
[18:03] and uh that's that's something else um
[18:06] last point on this um how do you think
[18:09] or Trump will use that like you
[18:11] mentioned it before a little bit that
[18:13] Trump will definitely use that to for
[18:16] for his campaign and and for further uh
[18:19] his presidency what do you think what is
[18:22] your theory here well he's a showman so
[18:25] he's definitely going to use it to his
[18:26] advantage and uh yeah he's going to get
[18:28] up there and he's going to be like they
[18:29] tried to take me out but they couldn't
[18:31] take me out he's going to use that as
[18:33] like that's probably going to be one of
[18:34] his big campaign slogans it's just like
[18:37] they they can't take me out and it's uh
[18:40] yeah it's like I I can't say for sure
[18:42] like I just watch this from the
[18:43] sidelines as a Canadian like the
[18:44] American election is just like
[18:46] entertainment for me at this point but
[18:48] uh I I certainly see it being a key
[18:52] point in his uh campaign going forward
[18:55] yeah absolutely one thing that we should
[18:57] also mention I think uh that that
[18:59] someone actually died like someone as I
[19:02] heard it is like actually got a shot and
[19:04] and died and I think two three other
[19:07] ones were were injured um so like
[19:11] it's
[19:13] definitely a dragic event for sure yeah
[19:16] um but yeah let's uh let's let's one
[19:19] thing one last thing that we covered
[19:21] before like we also tell we both saw it
[19:24] on X first I know it's hard not to talk
[19:26] about this because it just happened even
[19:28] though it's just like oh we want to talk
[19:29] about Bitcoin but yeah like this is such
[19:32] a huge moment in history and like it is
[19:35] like that it's it's it's hard to not
[19:37] talk about that and it's hard to it's
[19:39] also like there's so many strings
[19:42] attached to that like there is so many
[19:45] things that go away from that and and so
[19:48] many speculations and uh I think Trump
[19:51] did not address till now any Nations or
[19:54] something like that would be really
[19:56] interesting to see when he does it and
[19:58] what he says there like I will
[20:00] definitely watch that um because yeah
[20:03] will be very interesting um the one
[20:06] thing uh is like we we both saw it on X
[20:09] and and we both kind of like saw right
[20:11] now the power of of of that news news uh
[20:15] form when we talk about Twitter and
[20:18] there's all the news coming up in real
[20:20] real time and you don't have to wait for
[20:22] like someone uh putting on on the
[20:25] newspaper uh which is really interesting
[20:27] for me because I look at other social
[20:29] media accounts also and there was almost
[20:31] nothing or like just some some small
[20:33] thing or some article
[20:35] reposted um what do you think in general
[20:37] of of like X and and how it transformed
[20:41] with with El and and how do you like it
[20:44] well it's fascinating that you can just
[20:46] be tapped into a live feed of a massive
[20:49] historical event like moments after it
[20:52] happened like there was footage on my
[20:54] feed just about from multiple angles the
[20:57] the shots of of trump doing the fist
[20:59] bump and like uh like footage of of
[21:03] seeing the like the Secret Service guys
[21:04] up on the roof like kind of maneuvering
[21:07] to to get their shot and like it was it
[21:09] was fascinating to be able to watch it
[21:12] play out in real time rather than having
[21:14] to wait until some news organization put
[21:17] together a well-crafted media
[21:19] presentation like that they do it was
[21:20] like we were just getting Raw Feed of
[21:23] what was happening on the ground at an
[21:25] assassination attempt of a potential
[21:28] president front runner like it it's
[21:30] insane that we can that we live in this
[21:33] day and age right now that like that is
[21:35] that is what we we have access to and it
[21:37] is then interesting because there's like
[21:40] you and I and many others were're we're
[21:42] immersed in in the X space and then
[21:44] there's this whole subset of the
[21:46] population that isn't so they were they
[21:49] were not exposed to it in the same way
[21:50] that we were and then they potentially
[21:52] like there's going to be a lot of people
[21:53] that the only thing exposure they got
[21:55] was through the traditional mainstream
[21:57] media outlets and they're going to be
[22:00] given the the um like the the filtered
[22:04] version of of how they feel it should be
[22:07] presented rather than just this is what
[22:09] happened this is the raw footage this is
[22:10] the raw commentary that was happening at
[22:12] the time you make up your own minds and
[22:16] go from there and it was a yeah it's a
[22:19] it was a fascinating event that's that
[22:21] is for damn sure I think we can we can
[22:23] leave it at that uh it was a fascinating
[22:26] event and um starting the nuclear and
[22:30] and Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining
[22:31] discussion which is really fascinating
[22:34] uh topic but in terms of this event it's
[22:37] it almost seems boring yeah yeah it
[22:39] definitely draws your attention it's
[22:41] just like watching a watching a car
[22:42] wreck it's just like yeah we're all
[22:44] rubbernecking right now just see like
[22:46] what what what's going to come of this
[22:48] who's gonna who's gonna say something
[22:50] incredibly stupid to to make the
[22:52] situation even worse like I just I hope
[22:55] things can calm down and and we can move
[22:57] on and just get this election over with
[23:00] because Canada's got one coming up next
[23:02] year so I'm looking forward to that as
[23:03] well Canada's also interesting like
[23:06] trudo is right now the one leading right
[23:08] there's but there's one guy that is even
[23:11] consulted by Jeff Bard I forgot his name
[23:15] Pierre yeah that's Pierre pierra he's
[23:17] he's the leader of the conservative
[23:19] party so right now they are looking like
[23:22] if there was an election called today
[23:23] they would easily become a majority in
[23:27] in the in like Canadian Parliament but
[23:30] the way that our elections are
[23:32] structured because the Liberals have a
[23:35] coalition with the NDP party which is
[23:38] the the third ranking party between the
[23:40] two of them they form a majority
[23:44] unless they resend their
[23:47] support we are stuck with the current
[23:50] situation until our elections uh would
[23:54] be about October 25 roughly when it's uh
[23:57] expected to be to be um
[23:59] done but if there was a vote of
[24:03] non-confidence like we can have just an
[24:05] election called with and then with like
[24:07] within two months we're having an
[24:08] election that's kind of what happened in
[24:10] the fall of 2021 it was just there was a
[24:13] essentially the Liberals called for an
[24:16] election essentially saying that that
[24:18] this was a referendum on their covid
[24:21] policies and then they they timed it
[24:24] well because it was just before they
[24:27] started to lose a lot of support and it
[24:29] was right at the highest hype of of what
[24:31] was going on and they they leveraged
[24:34] that to get an extra four years in in
[24:36] power otherwise we would have naturally
[24:38] had an election last year if it was on
[24:40] the the predetermined schedule so it was
[24:44] an interesting strategy and it seems to
[24:45] have paid off for them because now they
[24:46] have a majority government essentially
[24:49] with their Coalition where they can pass
[24:51] whatever they want and there's nothing
[24:52] that the other parties and the
[24:54] conservatives can do about it except
[24:57] talk well speak about it and voice their
[25:00] opinion about how terrible these
[25:02] policies are because there's a lot of
[25:03] like uh I think we just passed a hate
[25:05] speech law in Canada which will make it
[25:09] very challenging to be very open about
[25:12] certain opinions online and it it's but
[25:17] then yeah you get in this like well who
[25:19] defines what hate speech is like it's it
[25:21] that becomes a very slippery slope and
[25:24] dangerous uh route to go down when when
[25:27] there is a chosen party that gets to
[25:31] Define what is hate speech so that they
[25:33] that never never ever ends well and it
[25:35] always becomes used as a weapon to
[25:38] silence any political opposition by just
[25:40] claiming everything that they say is
[25:41] hate speech so I don't I don't like the
[25:44] way that that things are going and that
[25:46] they're kind of running rough shot over
[25:48] how how they run the politics especially
[25:51] when if you in the polls they're they're
[25:53] just hemorrhaging support day after day
[25:55] yet they're just acting like we don't
[25:57] care we have the power we're just going
[25:59] to do whatever we want so there's a lot
[26:01] of people in Canada that would that
[26:02] would like to see a change of leadership
[26:05] in our country but uh we're going to
[26:07] have to wait it seems yeah hate speech
[26:09] for me is uh just an excuse to censor
[26:13] someone it's like it's like if if you're
[26:15] really a fan of freedom of speech then
[26:18] you have to get through the downsizes of
[26:23] freedom of speech which means there
[26:26] are then also people that you dislike or
[26:30] you don't agree with they also speaking
[26:33] they they can also act on freedom of
[26:35] speech they they can also voice the
[26:37] opinion and and if we cannot tolerate
[26:40] that um then it's just not freedom of
[26:42] speech like that we we should be really
[26:44] totally clear about that even if it's
[26:46] hate speech um uh it's it's it's to
[26:50] agree like if it's not vient like it
[26:53] gets tricky because like you don't want
[26:56] violence but like can you have violence
[26:58] with just words like that it's like a
[27:00] fine line for me because her words can
[27:03] really hurt but like freedom of speech
[27:05] should be protected at all costs uh and
[27:08] we should tolerate as much as possible
[27:11] well is limiting speech limits your
[27:13] ability to like think correctly and
[27:15] express yourself correctly and and as
[27:18] far as I'm concerned like yeah if if I
[27:20] would rather bad ideas be exposed to
[27:23] like the free market of ideas where they
[27:25] can be challenged and they can be be be
[27:28] put down by better arguments and that's
[27:30] why it's frustrating that the the
[27:33] authorities that like to push hate
[27:35] speech laws often aren't the best at
[27:39] putting forward or well their arguments
[27:41] are not a high enough quality that they
[27:44] are easily challenged so instead of
[27:47] letting their arguments be challenged
[27:49] they will just say that any challenge to
[27:51] their opinions is is verboten and that
[27:53] they shouldn't be allowed so it just it
[27:55] makes it it just gives them too much of
[27:57] an easy tool to to censor any opposition
[28:00] I don't I don't like the way that that
[28:02] is imposed but yeah we're going to have
[28:05] to voice yeah voice our opinion as
[28:08] strongly as possible that we we we
[28:10] reject any attempts to stifle Free
[28:13] Speech because challenging bad speech
[28:17] with better arguments is the way to
[28:20] go and like I can kind of spin that into
[28:22] like the nuclear argument because like
[28:24] that's one of the things that I I am
[28:26] very passionate about about nuclear
[28:27] power and and nuclear power has
[28:30] definitely has some some negative
[28:33] trade-offs there's there's no doubt
[28:34] about that but they're all often like
[28:37] out in the open like everybody kind of
[28:39] knows the risks of nuclear power
[28:42] and and and the like those trade-offs
[28:45] whereas a lot of the supporters of other
[28:47] technologies that are competing with
[28:49] nuclear power will often neglect a lot
[28:51] of their negative tradeoffs they'll F
[28:53] they'll they'll they'll focus on all of
[28:54] the negatives of nuclear in oil and gas
[28:57] and then compl ignore the positive
[28:59] aspects well then look pumping up their
[29:02] own preferred technology and ignoring
[29:05] like okay well when windmills are
[29:07] spinning they're generating free
[29:08] electricity but it's like okay well how
[29:10] did they get there in the first place
[29:12] what how were how are they constructed
[29:13] how much land are you occupying how much
[29:15] material are you using do you need to
[29:17] build new transmission lines to actually
[29:19] get that electricity delivered to where
[29:20] it needs to be how much subsidies are
[29:22] being involved do we actually even know
[29:24] what these things cost because there's
[29:25] so much distortions in these markets
[29:27] it's it's very challenging to have these
[29:29] arguments and discussions in in real
[29:31] time because nobody really knows what
[29:35] any of this these costs because there's
[29:37] so much like Fiat bad incentives
[29:40] permeating these markets that that uh
[29:44] yeah making an informed opinion about
[29:46] what is the most economic and effective
[29:48] power generation source is is totally up
[29:52] for argument and it it gets people very
[29:55] very
[29:56] passionately asserting
[29:58] like their preferred opinion on on these
[30:02] topics and and it's it's hard to
[30:03] actually get to the bottom of it why is
[30:05] nuclear energy so important I think as
[30:08] an Austrian and as a German
[30:10] I I'm I'm kind of not exposed to the
[30:13] positive side of nuclear energy that
[30:14] much uh so like give me like the why
[30:18] nuclear energy is is so important why we
[30:20] need it uh and and why we should embrace
[30:23] it and not other adenes maybe well well
[30:28] because like having access to
[30:30] electricity and and and energy is like
[30:32] vital for like social and economic
[30:34] development and it and it's funny
[30:37] because nuclear power is just one of
[30:39] those things that when it is operating
[30:41] as expected as intended it is very
[30:44] boring and most people barely hear
[30:46] anything about it unless they actually
[30:48] live near a nuclear power plant and they
[30:50] know people that work in a nuclear power
[30:51] plant or they work in one themselves
[30:54] whereas when the negative things happen
[30:57] in nuclear power that's what everyone
[30:59] that's the focal point that everyone is
[31:00] aware of Three Mile Island Chernobyl
[31:02] Fukushima like the nuclear weapons they
[31:04] they're very well attuned to to the
[31:07] negative aspects because that's been
[31:09] like highly sensationalized when they
[31:10] happen despite the fact that like
[31:13] kilowatt for kilowatt like although this
[31:15] is like a cold analysis but if you break
[31:17] it down right by the Numbers nuclear
[31:19] power on a per kilowatt basis is the
[31:22] absolute safest power generation
[31:25] technology that we have available to us
[31:27] like even just the a few weeks ago there
[31:28] was an explosion at a battery Factory in
[31:30] South Korea that killed uh 20 something
[31:33] people so like those Technologies also
[31:36] carry uh their own risk associated with
[31:38] them that we are as we're putting
[31:40] batteries into much wider use we're
[31:42] starting to see that there there are
[31:44] negative consequences if batteries go
[31:47] wrong so everything can go wrong even
[31:49] storing fertilizer poorly can go wrong
[31:52] as we saw in the port of Beirut a few
[31:54] years ago like every industrial
[31:56] technology has has associated with it
[31:58] and nuclear power absolutely does and
[32:01] like any other technology like airplanes
[32:03] we don't just stop iterating and making
[32:05] the technology better when we learn
[32:06] lessons that like yes there was a flaw
[32:09] we've learned it we're going to apply a
[32:10] solution to fix that that problem going
[32:12] forward so that it will never happen
[32:13] again like for example in Japan after
[32:16] Fukushima they shut down their entire
[32:18] fleet and then they had to start
[32:19] importing a lot of natural gas which
[32:21] wasn't too bad for a little while but
[32:22] then Japan's economy is is not uh not in
[32:25] the greatest shape right now with their
[32:26] their currency and their their uh debt
[32:29] to GDP ratio and all that stuff and
[32:30] their aging population so importing
[32:33] expensive natural gas has created extra
[32:37] challenges on people's ability to have a
[32:39] high standard of living so they're very
[32:41] aggressively trying to turn those their
[32:43] nuclear Fleet back on as quickly as
[32:45] possible and one of
[32:46] the things that they've done to ensure
[32:49] that should another tsunami strike the
[32:52] island they have turned all of their
[32:56] East Coast nucle power plants into
[32:59] fortresses with 20 M tall 3 m thick
[33:01] walls so that there's nothing that
[33:04] mother nature can throw at these things
[33:06] that would be able to cause a repeat of
[33:08] what happened in Fukushima and then on
[33:10] top of that because it was a failure of
[33:13] the backup generators is what uh caused
[33:16] the inability to shut down the reactor
[33:17] into a safe State they've put all of
[33:20] their backup generators on floating
[33:22] platform so if there was a potential for
[33:24] them to flood they would just float up
[33:26] and down and they wouldn't actually FF
[33:27] the generators so they would be able to
[33:29] continuously provide backup power should
[33:32] they have a situation where they needed
[33:33] to bring the reactors down into a safe
[33:34] state they're very determined to get
[33:36] those nuclear reactors back online
[33:38] because it provides so much power to
[33:41] their to their economy and it's such a
[33:45] benefit to their society to have access
[33:48] to that abundant power because Japan
[33:49] doesn't have the greatest access to
[33:52] Natural Resources they don't have great
[33:54] coal resources they don't have great gas
[33:55] resources they're on an island with
[33:58] limited land so like solar panels are
[34:00] not the the best option um the way that
[34:03] they're offshore um like undersea is
[34:05] does not accommodate offshore wind as
[34:08] well either so they're basically limited
[34:11] to either continuing to import gas and
[34:13] coal or reinvigorate their nuclear Fleet
[34:16] so it's um it it's kind of showing that
[34:22] yeah nuclear has it's it's its power
[34:25] density is just so immense that
[34:28] it's going to be like it it is a great
[34:30] benefit to those that do use it and then
[34:34] what what we're planning to do in the
[34:35] future with the next generation of
[34:36] nuclear reactors we want to make smaller
[34:38] ones that are able to engage with a much
[34:41] wider range of markets than are
[34:43] traditionally uh sought by like large
[34:46] nuclear generators because they've
[34:47] always tried to achieve economies of
[34:49] scale build them as big as possible and
[34:51] then you get your your the best
[34:53] economics but nuclear power has the
[34:57] potential to revolutionize the uh the
[35:00] power generation uh Dynamics in remote
[35:03] communities where like in Northern
[35:05] Canada for example we have to ship
[35:07] Diesel and at very narrow time frames in
[35:10] the winter be or during the year be when
[35:13] the the roads are frozen because
[35:15] otherwise it's in inaccessible to get it
[35:17] up there so there's very narrow windows
[35:18] it's very expensive to get it there so
[35:21] if we were able to build like small
[35:23] nuclear reactors in these remote
[35:25] communities whether it's like a
[35:26] community or like a a traditional
[35:28] mineral mine they will be able to have
[35:31] fuel available to them for like 5 10
[35:34] years without having to bring in a new
[35:36] um new resources in order to top that up
[35:38] so it completely changes the dynamic and
[35:41] sometime in in some cases like the the
[35:44] the levelized cost of energy of these
[35:46] new reactors isn't going to be
[35:48] competitive with some like on grid uh
[35:51] generation sources especially if like
[35:53] gas and coal are very cheap and if if
[35:55] like there's lots lots of solar
[35:57] penetration on these grids it may not be
[36:00] the best but in these markets where
[36:01] where they're paying upwards of 50 60
[36:04] cents a kilowatt hour for for diesel
[36:06] nuclear power is definitely going to be
[36:08] competitive in those markets once we
[36:10] develop these new technologies and micro
[36:12] reactors and smaller reactors that uh
[36:15] can apply to a much wider range of
[36:17] markets thank you you already made it
[36:19] halfway through the video and I'm really
[36:21] really grateful to have you here two
[36:23] things make this channel possible you as
[36:26] a watcher and listener who keep
[36:27] supporting this Channel and another one
[36:30] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[36:32] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[36:35] from the very start and where I
[36:37] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[36:39] Robin you even get a discount when you
[36:41] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[36:43] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[36:46] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[36:49] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[36:51] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[36:54] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[36:56] be in that 90 8% bracket be in the 2%
[37:00] bracket and if you have self- custody
[37:02] and you know your friend does not have
[37:03] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[37:05] he needs a birth Su present and a small
[37:07] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[37:09] 5% off your order plus you support my
[37:13] channel and now let's get back to the
[37:15] video it's a there are really
[37:17] interesting points already in there and
[37:19] I feel like when we talk about nuclear
[37:21] energy especially when when I talk with
[37:23] people around the topic that are
[37:25] negatively around that they often use
[37:28] the one argument that you already
[37:30] brought up with the accidents with Jal
[37:32] with Fukushima uh and this argument is
[37:36] for me never invalid one because just
[37:39] because we found an a mistake a bug or
[37:42] whatever doesn't mean that we stop
[37:44] developing if if it's if it's a
[37:46] technology that has no future like we we
[37:48] like no no it's it's just not scaling or
[37:50] whatever then like okay maybe we we
[37:53] should not do it but if if the only
[37:55] reason is like there's a bug or there's
[37:56] an accident or there's something gone
[37:58] wrong then we would have no innovation
[38:00] at all like every technology comes up
[38:03] with uh bugs with with the things that
[38:06] we have to fix like whenever you start
[38:08] anything you will find some uh
[38:11] challenges along the way like that's the
[38:13] most natural thing ever uh the other
[38:15] thing that I have often here is
[38:17] radioactive waste what what are we doing
[38:20] with the waste products of of nuclear
[38:22] energy um what is your like tackle of
[38:26] this misconcept waste is definitely an
[38:29] interesting contentious Topic in the
[38:31] nuclear industry because like because of
[38:34] the nature of radiation it definitely
[38:36] gives people paw with with engaging with
[38:38] it but as far as I'm concerned the
[38:40] nuclear waste is is a treasure Trove of
[38:42] potential resources that we can extract
[38:45] because for for the first spent fuel
[38:48] rods in the traditional reactors are not
[38:50] fully utilized they can still like 90%
[38:54] of the available power generation is
[38:57] still in those rods once they're taking
[38:59] out of the conventional reactors and
[39:01] then that is why um I think it's France
[39:04] Japan and Russia all have um fast
[39:07] breeder reactors that they can use
[39:10] reprocessed fuel and get further energy
[39:12] resources out of that and then on top of
[39:15] that like nuclear fision products many
[39:19] have potential uses that some some we
[39:22] haven't discovered yet but there are
[39:23] many isotopes that can only be created
[39:27] in the with exposure to like a neutron
[39:29] environment like uh like inside of a
[39:31] nuclear reactor or or an accelerator to
[39:34] create rare isotopes that are used for a
[39:37] number of different Industries
[39:38] especially in in medicine like I have no
[39:40] doubt that that like you and people you
[39:42] know like everybody at least knows
[39:44] somebody that has encountered a medical
[39:46] procedure where there was a radiological
[39:49] isotope associated with it whether it's
[39:52] was for like sterilizing the the
[39:54] single-use medical products or used as a
[39:57] as a tracer or as like a as a like a
[40:00] cancer therapy there's there's a lot of
[40:03] different resources available in in
[40:05] nuclear waste that we can extract and
[40:07] use for that sort of application and
[40:09] then the other part of the waste is
[40:10] because of how nuclear Decay
[40:14] works it actually becomes safer over
[40:17] time like yes there there are fision
[40:19] products that are shortlived that exist
[40:22] in nuclear waste when it's first
[40:24] extracted from a nuclear reactor that's
[40:25] why they're kept in in U cooling ponds
[40:29] for 5 to six years before then
[40:31] transferring them into uh solid cases
[40:33] for for their longterm storage and the
[40:37] reason for that is as the fision
[40:41] products the short-lived products Decay
[40:43] they Decay faster so that is what makes
[40:45] them disproportionately more dangerous
[40:47] and as they Decay they become a more
[40:50] stable element which then decays slower
[40:54] so if you're releasing less um nuclear
[40:57] particulates yeah the alpha beta gamma
[41:00] the different types of of radiation that
[41:01] we have as as that's being released it
[41:04] is making those products actually safer
[41:07] to engage with over time so essentially
[41:09] the plan is we want
[41:11] to create deep geological repositories
[41:14] where this these materials can be stored
[41:17] indefinitely but also in such a way that
[41:19] they are accessible for like the future
[41:24] to access them because we have no idea
[41:27] what
[41:28] technology will be developed that can
[41:29] actually find further uses for this
[41:31] material like for instance one one
[41:33] example that I like to use is uh is
[41:36] Cobalt I grew up in a community that um
[41:40] like back in the early 19th century
[41:42] there was a massive booming silver
[41:44] mining Community but part of the
[41:46] tailings from extracting silver was
[41:49] Cobalt and at the time Cobalt was just a
[41:50] waste product that had no industrial use
[41:52] at the time but now Cobalt is a part of
[41:56] just about anything and everything that
[41:58] we use in our high-tech Society so
[42:00] there's a lot of efforts now to go and
[42:03] reprocess a lot of those tailings that
[42:05] existed from all those old Silver Mines
[42:07] and extract the Cobalt so that we can
[42:09] use it for various uh like like
[42:13] high-tech um instruments that we use
[42:15] nowadays so the way I see it is like
[42:18] there's there's going to be some like we
[42:22] we don't know what sort of technological
[42:23] breakthroughs there will be in the
[42:24] future that we'll be able to make use of
[42:26] the material that is in nuclear waste
[42:28] and and radiation is just it's another
[42:33] industrial Hazard that we're we're
[42:34] familiar with and also like radiation
[42:36] occurs naturally in the world like we're
[42:38] exposed to Cosmic radiation when you fly
[42:40] on a plane uh if you have granite
[42:42] countertops those have like small
[42:44] amounts of radiation um like fire um
[42:47] smoke alarms have uh have used
[42:50] radiological material in them that was
[42:52] actually how um I don't know if you're
[42:54] familiar with uh the story of that the
[42:56] nuclear boy Scout but it was a a young
[42:59] young man I think he was about 14 or 15
[43:01] at the time he created a prototype
[43:04] nuclear fision reactor in his garage and
[43:07] the fuel that he got from that was
[43:08] extracted from uh I think it's amorium I
[43:12] definitely probably wrong on that but
[43:14] it's the isotope that's used in smoke
[43:16] detectors and he collected a lot of that
[43:19] into one location and he was able to use
[43:21] it to generate vision and then then he
[43:24] caught the attention of uh of uh I think
[43:26] it was the the defense department and
[43:28] then he got like he he went through a
[43:30] full full ride like scholarship and now
[43:32] he's a pretty high-end researcher in in
[43:34] the uh in the industry because this this
[43:37] kid was definitely a a uh Prodigy in the
[43:41] nuclear technology B he just figured
[43:44] this out on his own and and like working
[43:47] with radiation it's it's like working
[43:50] with any other industrial Hazard because
[43:51] actually in the nuclear industry there's
[43:53] far greater hazards from the fact that
[43:55] we're working with electricity heat and
[43:57] steam and large spinning objects like
[44:00] those those are the primary hazards when
[44:02] when dealing with this technology like
[44:04] radiation it it's manageable like it
[44:07] definitely carries risks with it but
[44:10] it's very well understood and it's we we
[44:13] limit the time that you're exposed to it
[44:15] you use shielding and then we use like
[44:17] other just other techniques to just
[44:20] prevent the exposure of workers to to
[44:23] radiation when they're working like I
[44:24] get exposed to radiation like almost
[44:26] every day but
[44:27] probably cumulatively less than somebody
[44:29] that travels on a plane like every at
[44:32] least once a month so
[44:34] it's it's it's it's a challenging
[44:37] phenomenon to discuss because it is so
[44:40] poorly understood especially with the
[44:42] way that it's been portrayed in pop
[44:44] culture over the the decades like most
[44:46] people's only exposure and to to nuclear
[44:50] power is from watching The Simpsons and
[44:53] it that was not the the best portrayal
[44:55] of the technology
[44:58] we'll leave that yeah I think uh in
[45:00] general like outside of Bitcoin outside
[45:02] of of nuclear energy I think we we have
[45:06] a problem of of not critical thinking
[45:08] enough like it's sometimes it's just
[45:10] okay to say I don't have opinion on that
[45:13] because I did not do enough research I
[45:15] did not do I did not collect too many
[45:18] informations and and that's what I do a
[45:20] lot of the times and just like hey I
[45:23] cannot say enough about that because
[45:26] it's it's like just in the area where I
[45:28] I'm not an expert and I did not do my
[45:30] research uh and and I think society
[45:32] would benefit from that if we just like
[45:34] step take a step back and say like oh I
[45:37] don't want to form an opinion on that
[45:38] even though some social group would
[45:40] force me to do and then we had more
[45:43] people of that we would have more people
[45:46] that actually think critical about stuff
[45:48] and research about stuff and then we
[45:49] would have I think um better views and
[45:52] better angles and perspectives on on on
[45:55] on on topics that
[45:57] maybe complexer or a little bit more
[46:01] like they're not that easy to comprehend
[46:04] as Bitcoin as nuclear energy as Bitcoin
[46:06] Mar I definitely chose to Champion two
[46:08] of the most poorly understood
[46:10] technologies that we have available to
[46:13] us you chose an really interesting inter
[46:16] intersection it's it's actually
[46:18] interesting because when when you look
[46:20] at Bitcoin mining and when you look at
[46:21] nuclear
[46:22] energy like why did you go in that and
[46:25] what's the what's the interesting well I
[46:28] have been working at uh Canadian nuclear
[46:30] Laboratories for 10 years now so and
[46:32] just disclaimer these are opinions of my
[46:34] own don't represent the company just got
[46:36] to make sure that I put that in there
[46:37] just for for legal reasons because I'd
[46:39] like to keep my job um because they
[46:41] don't have a position on bitcoin just
[46:44] yet I'm working on that um but yeah so I
[46:48] had been working at this company well it
[46:51] it's it's a actually a crown corporation
[46:53] that government financed because yeah we
[46:57] the the government supports the nuclear
[46:58] research so then we support the entire
[47:02] can do reactor Fleet and do uh basically
[47:05] material research fuel research that
[47:07] supports the industry basically we do
[47:09] everything except build and operate
[47:11] nuclear reactors like we used to have on
[47:14] site the the original research reactors
[47:16] but they're they're no longer
[47:17] operational they've reached the end of
[47:19] their life and they've since been
[47:21] retired but we still support a lot of
[47:23] the operations of the the broader can do
[47:26] Fleet and and some extra stuff that
[47:27] supports the um the other light water
[47:30] and pressurized water reactors and then
[47:32] we're also doing a lot of research to
[47:34] support the oncoming Generation 4
[47:36] reactors but that's kind of what what
[47:39] led me to to support like the the small
[47:42] modular reactors and and take that as as
[47:44] my kind of predominant interest when I
[47:47] started to connect the dots of Bitcoin
[47:49] because I I have similar story with my
[47:53] my Bitcoin Journey as everyone else like
[47:55] I had a few touch points back in 11 13
[47:58] they just I they never stuck and then I
[48:00] ended up cashing out some Bitcoin in 171
[48:04] 18 from an online poker site and then I
[48:06] just kind of forgot about it and I just
[48:07] left that in a wallet and then what
[48:10] happened was in the runup in 21 that
[48:13] around Christmas time I actually started
[48:16] to pay attention and take it seriously
[48:18] so that was I've I've only truly been a
[48:21] bitcoiner for about three and a half
[48:22] years I have not completed my fouryear
[48:24] cycle yet um and then it was I just I
[48:28] went right down the rabbit hole I
[48:29] started with Max Kaiser's podcast and
[48:31] before I knew what I was listening to
[48:32] Safe Dean listening to Robert Breedlove
[48:34] and then before I knew it my entire
[48:36] podcast catalog went from like Joe Rogan
[48:38] Jordan Peterson to just completely
[48:39] orange pilled and it was around the time
[48:45] that Elon Musk had made his comments
[48:48] about the negative aspect of of the
[48:52] types of energy that Bitcoin uses and
[48:54] that was when the market dumped in on in
[48:56] that spring and it was actually my wife
[48:59] that implanted this idea in my mind
[49:01] because I had gotten really excited
[49:03] about it I had listened I had learned
[49:04] about what Upstream data was doing with
[49:06] the capturing flare gas and I was like
[49:08] oh that's really interesting use use of
[49:10] this technology to to eliminate the
[49:12] wasted power that was available on in
[49:15] the in the natural gas Fields where
[49:19] where it got interesting was I was
[49:21] presenting these ideas to my wife and
[49:22] then when we were when she saw Elon Musk
[49:25] commentary she was like why don't we
[49:27] just use nuclear power for this and she
[49:29] just kind of said it as just like oh
[49:30] that's that's just that's just a given
[49:32] like why why why aren't we doing this
[49:34] and then I I had been kind of more
[49:36] immersed in the space I was like
[49:37] nobody's talking about nuclear power
[49:39] right now anytime nuclear power comes up
[49:40] in the Bitcoin space it's like oh they
[49:42] just shut down Indian Point oh they just
[49:44] shut down the Palisades reactor oh they
[49:46] just shut down Pilgrim reactor and and
[49:48] then and the German reactors were all
[49:51] shutting down and it was not it was it
[49:54] was definitely a bare market for the
[49:55] nuclear industry and then
[49:58] I from my perspective I was seeing what
[50:00] was coming because Canada has very
[50:02] aggressively pursuing what they call the
[50:04] the small modular reactor action plan
[50:06] where they want to nurture three
[50:09] different streams of of new nuclear
[50:11] technology like one of them being like
[50:13] the micro reactors that I've already
[50:14] kind of mentioned that we want to use to
[50:16] to deploy to remote communities to
[50:18] upgrade them off of diesel which I also
[50:20] believe that'll have uh great beneficial
[50:22] benefits to to many many many places
[50:25] throughout the the develop world and
[50:27] like island nations and then the another
[50:29] stream they want to develop is is more
[50:31] akin to being able to replace on grid
[50:34] power generation sources like coal
[50:35] plants that are are serving moderate
[50:38] sized grids that aren't going don't
[50:40] don't really need like large gigawatt
[50:42] sized reactors and then the third stream
[50:44] that they're pursuing is uh more for
[50:47] industrial heat because the new fuel
[50:49] types and coolant types that they intend
[50:50] to use can achieve temperatures as high
[50:53] as like 800 900 deg C whereas the
[50:56] traditional boiled water reactors you're
[50:58] limited to how hot you can boil water at
[51:01] which Under Pressure you can get it up
[51:02] to like about 100 200ish degrees Celsius
[51:06] which can apply to many Industries and
[51:09] in in some cases it's used for district
[51:10] Heating in places like like Finland and
[51:12] and in Russia they they use a lot of uh
[51:15] nuclear heat for their District heating
[51:17] but being able to push that up to 800
[51:19] 900 Degrees celsus that opens up a lot
[51:22] more opportunities for like
[51:23] petrochemical refining just mineral
[51:25] refining um textiles like concrete
[51:29] manufacturing like there's it it
[51:32] broadens the industries that nuclear
[51:34] power can apply to greatly it from from
[51:38] where it has been like there's still a
[51:40] range up into like the the thousands of
[51:42] degrees Celsius that requires either
[51:44] like large induction furnaces or or
[51:47] coked coal to to get to those
[51:49] temperatures but as far as I'm concerned
[51:52] the more hydrocarbons we can displace
[51:55] from Power and heat generation the more
[51:58] available that they will be to other
[52:00] markets where they will have a much
[52:02] higher order use like when we can when
[52:04] we don't need to use as much
[52:05] hydrocarbons in in power power
[52:07] generation we can use them for like
[52:10] combining different hydrocarbons like uh
[52:12] with the cracking process we can
[52:13] essentially design any hydrocarbons we
[52:15] want it just takes a lot of energy to do
[52:17] it like if as long as we have the the
[52:19] base material of of like uh carbon
[52:22] dioxide methane nitrogen oxygen
[52:27] hydrogen we with enough power those can
[52:30] be combined into any
[52:32] hydrocarbon at any length that we really
[52:34] want to it's just're we're limited to
[52:36] the availability of the power and
[52:38] comparing the economics of doing so to
[52:41] it's still easier and more economical to
[52:44] just extract oil and refine the oil and
[52:46] to to get those hydrocarbons So
[52:48] eventually it might reach an inflection
[52:50] point where it's more economical to to
[52:54] to do like the the synthetic
[52:55] hydrocarbons but
[52:57] but yeah like like I said like as far as
[52:59] I'm concerned we we can displace a lot
[53:00] of that out of the power markets and put
[53:02] them to much higher order uses and and I
[53:05] like to kind of compare it like it'll be
[53:07] S of kind of like a jeevan's paradox
[53:09] idea where it's like the more available
[53:11] we make it the more we're going to end
[53:13] up using we're never going to not be
[53:15] using hydrocarbons they're so embedded
[53:17] with everything in our
[53:19] society and all I I just see we're going
[53:22] to be able to start using them more
[53:24] economically and more effectively and
[53:25] efficiently if when they're they're
[53:27] displaced from power generation that is
[53:29] interesting I mean um like full
[53:32] disclosure I have almost no knowledge
[53:35] about like energy production energy
[53:38] things like I there were like already
[53:39] three four guests on that talked about
[53:41] that get get some some in insights in
[53:44] that um I'd recommend getting someone on
[53:47] like uh like Harry sck or Adam orloff
[53:50] from Upstream data like they they're
[53:52] very articulate at at discussing like
[53:54] energy problems and energy markets
[53:56] they're very intelligent guys in this
[53:58] space I would love that like can you
[54:00] send me afterwards like an X handle or
[54:02] something like that so I can look at
[54:04] because I don't know them yeah I'll poke
[54:06] them they like talking about this stuff
[54:07] so actually Adam did a really good one
[54:11] with uh the Bitcoin Daily Show with uh W
[54:14] what's what's his name he goes by the
[54:15] dman Craig Craig LeBlanc um yeah they
[54:18] host like a daily Twitter space um every
[54:21] morning on on on Thursdays the topic is
[54:24] specifically on energy and Bitcoin
[54:25] mining so we got we'll get into all
[54:27] kinds of interesting topics and like one
[54:29] of them that was come came up this week
[54:30] is the uh the incoming demand from Ai
[54:35] and a lot of a lot of eyes of are on
[54:39] what's happening at the sus Guana power
[54:40] plant in Pennsylvania because that's
[54:42] where Amazon just acquired a partially
[54:45] complete uh data center campus that was
[54:47] already partially begun uh because of
[54:50] the the joint venture between Talon
[54:52] energy that owns the power plant and
[54:55] Tera wolf that has uh has a contract
[54:58] with them that they built a small
[54:59] Bitcoin mine and then on the side they
[55:02] were they were building a larger a high
[55:04] performance Computing data center for
[55:07] with the intention of attracting a
[55:08] bigger fish but then that's also caused
[55:10] another interesting second order effect
[55:13] that that wasn't immediately apparent
[55:15] until until it was was raised about a
[55:18] week ago that if you start pulling gws
[55:21] off of the grid and putting them behind
[55:22] the meter yes that is great for the
[55:25] nuclear power plant especially
[55:26] especially since they've been kind of
[55:27] getting a raw deal in recent years
[55:28] because traditionally like over
[55:31] especially over the last decade as more
[55:33] subsidized power generation sources have
[55:35] been entering these grids so the
[55:38] competitors to nuclear power are able to
[55:40] generate Revenue by outside sources
[55:44] rather than just selling power into the
[55:45] grid and then that causes all kinds of
[55:47] distortions and then the nuclear power
[55:49] plants are often put in a position where
[55:50] they're either going to have to curil
[55:52] their power or accept like very low or
[55:54] negative prices for for their power
[55:55] generation because like a wind wind farm
[55:58] that's getting subsidies can be
[55:59] profitable still when they're selling
[56:01] power to the Grid at ne6 cents kilowatt
[56:03] hour so then if the nuclear power plant
[56:05] is exposed to that that completely
[56:07] buggers up their economics so there is
[56:08] an incentive for them to find a large
[56:11] static load that can always be available
[56:14] to consume their power and pay good
[56:15] money for it which is which is like very
[56:19] like it it it makes it this this um this
[56:23] change where AI is now coming from
[56:26] massive power uh generation
[56:30] assets the the nuclear industry is very
[56:32] much paying attention but as as I was
[56:34] getting to and kind of got derailed but
[56:35] when you pull gigawatts Off the Grid now
[56:38] they're not contributing to delivery
[56:39] fees and those delivery fees are what
[56:41] support the ongoing maintenance of like
[56:43] the wider transmission infrastructure so
[56:46] now those costs are going to be
[56:48] amortized across a a smaller consumer
[56:50] base ultimately raising the costs for
[56:53] the end consumer in the other parts of
[56:55] the market so there's
[56:56] so there's kind of a double-edged sword
[56:58] like if if you're not contributing to
[57:01] the power like the transmission
[57:03] infrastructure it's it's going to change
[57:05] the the cost and pricing structure
[57:07] Dynamics for other users on that grid so
[57:10] I expect that it's going to be a little
[57:12] bit of a headwind and then also the the
[57:15] company that is raising these complaints
[57:17] is called Exelon and in I don't remember
[57:20] exactly when but they spun off and
[57:23] divested in their nuclear energy sets
[57:26] that they used to own about four or five
[57:29] years ago so now it all that is owned by
[57:31] the company Constellation Energy so
[57:34] Exelon is the one that's raising these
[57:36] concerns so some people have argued that
[57:39] it's like they're just kind of have sour
[57:41] grapes that they are no longer
[57:43] participating in this market so they can
[57:45] no longer they can't capture the benefit
[57:47] of attracting AI to their power assets
[57:50] because they don't own them anymore so
[57:51] they're now kind of raising a stink
[57:53] about like oh well if these other
[57:54] generators do that it's going to cause
[57:56] more more issues on the grid so it's
[57:59] there's always there's always tradeoffs
[58:01] whenever something major changes it's
[58:03] like one gear shifts and then it affects
[58:05] another gear and then another gear and
[58:07] then we see all these effects that are
[58:08] weren't immediately apparent when we
[58:10] were just like excitedly being like Oh
[58:12] yes nuclear power and AI are getting
[58:13] together and we're going to see a lot of
[58:14] development in that and then I also use
[58:17] that one to kind of point out that that
[58:21] it
[58:21] is in some ways could be argued that
[58:24] that it plays into Brandon quid's
[58:26] pioneer species idea where it's like the
[58:28] Bitcoin miners kind of came there and
[58:29] kind of planted the seed and now it's
[58:33] attracted a much bigger fish into that
[58:36] market and the way I see it is is what's
[58:37] going to happen is AI is going to to
[58:40] slowly displace the Bitcoin Miners and
[58:41] push them further out into the margins
[58:43] where they will plant more seeds further
[58:45] out in in like in the marginal areas
[58:48] where electricity is is still kind of
[58:50] plentiful but not the demand for it
[58:52] isn't available so then they will make
[58:54] that more economical to develop that
[58:55] those sort of power assets and then as
[58:58] they become more robust and develop lot
[59:01] more uh infrastructure around them
[59:03] whether it's uh data connectivity or
[59:05] just like roads and transmission
[59:07] infrastructure then it's more amable for
[59:12] a more sophisticated energy buyer to
[59:14] enter those markets so it it does look
[59:15] like it's going to start playing out
[59:17] like that that the Bitcoin miners are
[59:18] going to go seed Energy Products that
[59:19] were uneconomical as we're seeing like
[59:21] with what uh gridless is doing out in
[59:23] Africa and then it will make the
[59:27] environment more attractive to energy
[59:30] buyers that that need a more robust and
[59:33] and resilient circumstances to operate
[59:35] in because like AI the the type of power
[59:39] demand and connectivity demands between
[59:42] Ai and Bitcoin mining is wildly
[59:44] different like the Bitcoin miners are
[59:45] very rugged and robust and they can they
[59:48] can operate in some pretty bizarre
[59:50] conditions that there's no way that AI
[59:53] uh data centers would even consider in
[59:56] until the market is is is matured and
[59:58] they can actually have confidence that
[60:00] they'll they'll have the resources
[60:01] available to them so so they're they're
[60:04] kind of competing for the same Market
[60:06] but not entirely like it it's it's it's
[60:10] interesting to see these how these
[60:11] developments are playing out it's really
[60:12] interesting and I thought about like the
[60:15] AI and and Bitcoin mining kind of
[60:17] competing uh to each other um and the
[60:20] one thought that constantly comes up
[60:22] when you when you were talking is like
[60:24] Market manipulation is on all level is
[60:26] bad like when subsidies and all that
[60:28] stuff like it it it manipulates just the
[60:31] Innovation that that's that's
[60:32] fascinating um do you think and a lot of
[60:35] people in in when when I talk to energy
[60:38] people think that like at least hint to
[60:41] that um do we think that we at some
[60:43] point live in an energy abundant system
[60:46] where energy is so abundant abundantly
[60:50] available uh that we don't have like
[60:53] right nowaday is like when you look at
[60:55] mainstream media they're like oh energy
[60:56] is not there like we have to uh make
[60:59] sure we have enough energy and energy
[61:00] resources and stuff like that uh then I
[61:03] saw that the energy consumption per uh
[61:06] person since 1971 is not really Rising
[61:09] like it was just a little bit Rising per
[61:11] person um the overall energy consumption
[61:14] was Rising but when you break it down to
[61:16] per person it's it's it's just a little
[61:17] bit Rising what what's your thoughts on
[61:19] like when we get more efficient with
[61:21] things and when we get more creative
[61:25] with absor absorbing energy from the
[61:26] planet maybe also from other planets um
[61:29] had a crazy guest on who said like we
[61:30] will get Mercury with with solar panels
[61:34] and and extract the the the energy from
[61:36] the Sun in that way um do do we have the
[61:39] chance to live at some point in an
[61:41] energy abundant future oh absolutely
[61:44] like we we are we definitely have the
[61:46] chance to climb up the the kardashev
[61:49] scale and if anybody isn't familiar with
[61:51] that it was it was just a um a a power
[61:55] consumption scale where a Russian
[61:58] physicist came up with that was at level
[62:01] one this society's able to consume all
[62:04] of the Power that's available to it on
[62:06] its planet and then level two in the
[62:08] solar system and then level three is
[62:09] like in the galaxy and then you start
[62:11] getting beyond that and it starts
[62:12] getting crazy like Godlike powers that
[62:14] we can manipulate planets and orbits and
[62:18] that that's getting crazy but like we
[62:20] are on the verge of starting to plant
[62:23] the foundation to get to that level one
[62:26] as as far as I can tell like the the
[62:29] pieces are starting to come together we
[62:31] have the available technology to start
[62:34] to to to Really head down that path but
[62:38] yeah it just it does like as you said
[62:40] like the the Fiat system has kind of
[62:42] stagnated everything it it gives the
[62:44] appearance of a lot of technological
[62:46] development but it just there's there's
[62:48] something missing underneath it it's
[62:50] it's like we're being denied all of the
[62:52] the the real fruits of our techn Tech
[62:55] olical advancement like as as je Jeff
[62:58] boo described so aply just we should be
[63:01] living in a naturally deflationary
[63:04] environment where things are getting
[63:06] more
[63:07] affordable but that is being stolen from
[63:10] us by a parasitic class that then
[63:12] redistributes it to whatever they feel
[63:16] is is necessary and at the moment like
[63:19] they put a lot of that technology lot of
[63:21] that Capital has been directed towards
[63:25] building windmills and solar panels and
[63:27] like don't get me wrong I I do not have
[63:30] I don't want no windmills and solar
[63:34] panels at all but as far as I'm
[63:35] concerned powering the foundation of a
[63:37] high-tech Society we're going to need a
[63:40] lot more than depending dependence on
[63:42] the weather and I I like them for very
[63:45] hyper local scenarios like if you got
[63:47] solar panels on your like remote Farm
[63:49] that's in the middle of nowhere that is
[63:51] awesome and you should you should
[63:53] definitely do that but building Feld
[63:55] Feld and Fields and like hundreds and
[63:58] thousands of Acres of solar panels is
[64:01] just it it's ugly and it's a BL on the
[64:04] landscape and then it causes these
[64:06] negative side effects of of where yeah
[64:09] the further you have to get into lower
[64:11] quality areas and then you have to build
[64:13] out the transmission into it and then
[64:15] like yes it's great that the power
[64:16] generated is free at the time but then
[64:18] when you start looking at the all of the
[64:21] externalities that go around that and
[64:23] how difficult it is to integrate that
[64:25] with the grids like that's where your
[64:26] costs start to ramp up and and make it
[64:28] more challenging to bring these power
[64:30] resources onto the grid whereas like a
[64:32] nuclear power plant don't need nearly as
[64:34] much transmission infrastructure we
[64:35] don't need as much land we don't need as
[64:38] material as much material resources to
[64:40] build them it's basically concrete steel
[64:42] and uranium and in probably in the not
[64:45] too distant future we will be using a
[64:46] lot of lot more thorium for nuclear
[64:48] power generation and there's even
[64:50] assumptions that many of the other um
[64:54] transuranic uh elements can be used for
[64:56] power generation as well and like what I
[64:58] mean by that is just um on the periodic
[65:01] table where you have like uranium
[65:02] neptunium plutonium there's a whole
[65:04] other row of elements that have similar
[65:08] properties but it's just
[65:10] uranium is the easiest way that we know
[65:13] of to generate nuclear fion because it's
[65:15] just you bombard it with a neutron it
[65:17] becomes unstable it splits it releases a
[65:20] lot of energy releases more neutrons
[65:22] those neutrons Cascade create more fion
[65:25] splits and then releases more energy and
[65:27] we've just we've learned how to control
[65:28] that in a very effective way to generate
[65:30] a lot of power and if we want to really
[65:35] build a space fairing Society like
[65:39] nuclear power is going to have to be at
[65:43] the foundation of it it's going to play
[65:45] a predominant role like I I don't expect
[65:46] it to be like 100 I don't want to see
[65:48] like 100% nuclear power as as as as what
[65:51] we rely on but I think it should at
[65:54] least be up like half of our power it
[65:57] should be like nuclear power and every
[65:59] Every Nation on the planet should have
[66:02] accessibility to this technology and
[66:04] like yes there there there is associated
[66:07] risks with it with with uh bad players
[66:11] using it for nefarious purposes but the
[66:14] technology that we're developing now is
[66:17] going to be highly proliferation
[66:19] resistant like there the the next
[66:22] generation of nuclear reactors and the
[66:23] nuclear fuels that we use won't that
[66:25] won't even have to be a consideration as
[66:27] as far as I can tell whereas the
[66:30] previous generation of nuclear reactors
[66:32] like the Ken when plutonium is a fision
[66:36] product and then that can be extracted
[66:37] and then that's that's actually how
[66:39] India managed to obtain nuclear weapons
[66:41] was with their their nuclear reactors
[66:43] they were able to to refine the fuel in
[66:46] such a way that they could could produce
[66:49] n uh nuclear weapons grade material so
[66:52] so there was there was always challenges
[66:54] associated with that and that is why
[66:56] there was uh a US imposed moratorium on
[67:00] the reprocessing of nuclear fuel that's
[67:01] been in place for at least the last 50
[67:03] or so years and making it nearly
[67:05] impossible for other nations to develop
[67:08] their own uh nuclear fuel supply chains
[67:10] unless they were independently able to
[67:12] do it like Russia and China have been
[67:14] capable of
[67:16] doing so it's it's such a complex
[67:20] technology and it has it has it has a
[67:23] legacy associated with it as well the
[67:25] that definitely makes it challenging to
[67:28] address in the F in in the modern age
[67:30] because like like when they were
[67:32] extracting uranium in the the early 50s
[67:36] when they were aggressively trying to
[67:37] produce nuclear weapons during the Cold
[67:39] War they weren't as considerate for the
[67:42] environment that that they were
[67:43] extracting it from or the people that
[67:45] lived there so there's there's those
[67:46] those Legacy aspects and but now the
[67:49] modern industry is like well yes we
[67:51] acknowledge that that happened and we
[67:54] have to develop strategies to reconcile
[67:56] what happened and actually make it make
[67:58] amends for what we did and clean clean
[68:00] up any messes that are come from
[68:02] previous generations of this technology
[68:04] it's it's not like we're trying to keep
[68:06] it a secret that that yes there there
[68:08] was definitely a history with this
[68:09] technology that that is complicated
[68:12] especially with nuclear power being able
[68:14] to be used for both peaceful uses and
[68:17] wlike uses so it's disentangling those
[68:20] two is is is a great challenge
[68:22] especially for a generation that lived
[68:24] under this threat of nuclear war for so
[68:26] long and now that even with what's going
[68:29] on in Russia like that is
[68:32] provocative with a nuclear power Nation
[68:35] or that can yeah that that has these
[68:38] weapons and like so now it's becoming a
[68:41] Talking Point again in geopolitics so I
[68:44] I would hope that nothing like that
[68:46] happens but yeah being being in this
[68:50] situation is creates challenges for for
[68:53] people that don't fully
[68:55] understand the the peaceful uses of that
[68:58] technology that that we can if we have a
[69:01] strong enough incentive to use it for
[69:03] for power generation like perhaps we can
[69:07] create a disincentive to be using it for
[69:10] weapons uses like that's kind of one of
[69:12] my interesting thesis because we never
[69:15] didn't actually really get into too much
[69:16] of like the the Bitcoin mining side of
[69:18] this stuff but I believe that if Bitcoin
[69:20] mining creates a strong enough incentive
[69:23] to be generating power
[69:26] we're going to be seeking sources of
[69:30] uranium fuel from everywhere that we can
[69:32] get our hands on it and like right now
[69:34] it's most economical to extract it from
[69:36] the ground because there are still many
[69:37] very high quality uh um uh say just like
[69:42] U places where where it's found in the
[69:44] world whether it's in Canada Australia
[69:46] parts of Africa eventually it would be
[69:50] more economical and if there is a strong
[69:52] enough incentive to be like hey there's
[69:55] uh lot of potential fuel in these
[69:57] nuclear weapons and that's kind of what
[69:59] was was happening as some of the like
[70:01] Russia and us have been down blending
[70:03] some of their uh their weapons grade uh
[70:06] uranium into potential fuel for these
[70:10] nuclear reactors so so yeah my crazy
[70:12] theory is that if if a strong enough
[70:14] incentive is in play we could lead to
[70:17] the de de proliferation of nuclear
[70:19] weapons so that's that's one I I hope
[70:23] that Bitcoin could be that incentive and
[70:26] it certainly seems like it's strong
[70:28] enough especially now that we're
[70:29] starting to see like we can generate the
[70:32] scarcest asset known to man with
[70:34] electricity whereas everybody else like
[70:37] Black Rock these large investment uh
[70:39] firms and asset managers they can only
[70:42] get it by buying it or exchanging goods
[70:44] and services and there's going to be a
[70:46] point in the in the near future where
[70:49] bitcoiners are not going to exchange
[70:51] their Bitcoin for Fiat dollars anymore
[70:53] and that's going to be an interesting
[70:54] inflection point because then then it
[70:56] becomes that either you have to sell a
[70:58] good or service or you have to generate
[70:59] power and generating power has many
[71:04] other positive externalities so it's
[71:07] going to push us up that cardish shev
[71:11] scale by just wanting more power to
[71:14] obtain more Bitcoin and then on the side
[71:16] there's just going to be a lot more
[71:18] power available for society to like just
[71:22] abundance I love it a lot like uh you
[71:25] make a lot of sense honestly it's it's
[71:27] it's it's it makes me bullish on Bitcoin
[71:30] mining and on on the future itself um
[71:32] when you look at because you touched on
[71:34] Bitcoin mining um when you look at
[71:36] Bitcoin mining uh where do you see the
[71:39] future of it like in in 20 years how
[71:41] does how will Bitcoin mining evolve we
[71:44] have right now like a lot of companies
[71:46] uh involved it gets more and more
[71:48] competitive the mining pools get like it
[71:51] got more decentralized over count but
[71:53] the mining pools are kind of uh
[71:55] centralized how do you see the the
[71:57] overall future of Bitcoin mining when
[71:59] you look at 10 20
[72:00] years yeah like definitely the like the
[72:03] pool stuff that's kind of outside of of
[72:05] my scope but like I that'll get worked
[72:08] out just the game theory we we we'll
[72:09] find a way and especially with new tools
[72:12] like stratum V2 that'll be able to dis
[72:15] kind of more distribute um block
[72:17] template creation to to a a wider
[72:21] potential like group of of of miners
[72:24] instead of just limiting it to to the
[72:26] pool so that's going to be an
[72:27] interesting development to just to see
[72:29] how that gets worked out cu every time
[72:32] the system seems to get stressed for one
[72:33] reason or another like that's when the
[72:36] people the builders in the space are
[72:38] prompted to be like okay now we we now
[72:40] we have a problem we need to overcome
[72:42] we're going to build some tools to
[72:43] either work around it or overcome it
[72:45] like that's why like the lightning
[72:46] network was built to overcome like the
[72:48] throughput capacity of of the main chain
[72:51] and yeah we Humanity will always find a
[72:54] way Tech ourselves out of a pro any any
[72:57] problems that we find ourselves in but
[72:59] as as this industry is maturing like
[73:01] we're just seeing like I've only been
[73:03] like really immersed in it for for three
[73:04] years but in this short time it has
[73:07] matured significantly from like it was
[73:09] barely 100 ex aash when I started paying
[73:11] attention to it just before the China
[73:13] ban and now we're what pushing 600 x
[73:16] aash and that's that's huge but then
[73:18] we're also seeing the the growth of many
[73:20] of these public mining companies and
[73:23] other private mining companies that have
[73:24] become very very well Adept at managing
[73:27] risk whether it's like their their debt
[73:29] management their financing how they
[73:31] huddle their Bitcoin the the type of
[73:33] power that they they seek out they're
[73:37] they're showing a lot a higher degree of
[73:40] maturity that that this industry is
[73:43] getting to a point where power
[73:45] generation is starting to actually take
[73:47] it a little bit more seriously like
[73:49] there's probably still a little bit ways
[73:50] to go but I think by the end of thisy
[73:52] having cycle we're going to see a lot
[73:55] more engagement with large power
[73:57] generators like we're kind of seeing
[73:59] things happen like with out in the oil
[74:01] fields now that they're approaching the
[74:03] idea of being able to capture their
[74:04] flare gas and that is a huge advancement
[74:06] for them but then the way I see it with
[74:09] nuclear reactors with this new
[74:10] generation especially the way that we
[74:12] want to deploy them to remote
[74:13] communities the risk of underutilizing
[74:16] the asset is a huge economic negative to
[74:19] them because if you're going to build
[74:22] power capacity somewhere where you don't
[74:23] have demand to use it all the economics
[74:26] just don't exist that's why grid list
[74:27] does what they do like they'll find a
[74:29] hydroelectric Dam that's getting 40%
[74:31] utility and then they will make it get
[74:33] up to 100 and then because of the
[74:35] flexible properties of Bitcoin mining
[74:37] they can complet sync with whatever the
[74:39] the load and demand is in in that local
[74:41] jurisdiction so I see a similar strategy
[74:45] playing out with with like U the micro
[74:48] reactors that we want to deploy remotely
[74:50] and I don't know for sure what's going
[74:53] to start Evol evolving first like our
[74:56] power generation companies going to
[74:57] start acquiring Bitcoin Miners and just
[75:01] have it as like a sub Department that's
[75:02] just like okay this is you we we have
[75:04] this one little wing of our company that
[75:06] specializes in engaging with these
[75:09] flexible loads that can greatly benefit
[75:12] us in the long term or is it going to be
[75:14] the Bitcoin miners that if if we do have
[75:18] like a crazy runup in the price of
[75:21] Bitcoin like they have a lot of Bitcoin
[75:23] on their balance sheets especially like
[75:24] companies like Marathon that are holding
[75:26] a significant amount of of Bitcoin if
[75:28] the value of that goes to the moon like
[75:31] they have a lot of capital at their
[75:32] disposal and they will probably start
[75:34] considering just buying power assets
[75:36] wherever they can and
[75:38] then I wouldn't be surprised if we also
[75:40] start
[75:41] seeing as um as like the SMR companies
[75:44] are starting to get through their
[75:46] licensing process and through all like
[75:49] the regulatory stuff and starting to see
[75:50] the Finish Line in sight they're going
[75:52] to want to engage with the Bitcoin
[75:55] miners because just they provide such an
[75:59] awesome anchor load that they would need
[76:03] to ensure that they're going to be able
[76:04] to sell their power to somewhere no
[76:07] matter where they deploy their assets
[76:09] like because it's basically just we have
[76:11] the traditional conduits that we push
[76:13] electricity through is the the copper
[76:15] power lines whereas now they have the
[76:17] optionality of a digital conduit that
[76:19] they can sell that power so that enables
[76:22] them to use it as as a buyer First
[76:23] Resort so when they first build their
[76:25] their assets they've got that consumer
[76:27] there day one available to take all of
[76:30] that power and then as the whatever the
[76:34] intent intended use was for that as that
[76:37] ramps up because the Bitcoin miners are
[76:39] very dynamic they can either be shipped
[76:41] to a new location or they can be scaled
[76:44] dynamically to float around with with
[76:46] the power generation and then on the
[76:48] back end as like if it's like a
[76:50] traditional mineral mine they only have
[76:51] a lifetime of like 15 to 20 years so but
[76:55] the power asset is still viable for
[76:57] potentially like 30 40 years so the
[77:00] Bitcoin miners can just refill that
[77:02] space after it has served its purpose
[77:04] for the like traditional mineral
[77:06] extraction and then they can continue
[77:08] generating positive economic Returns on
[77:10] that asset because one of the biggest
[77:12] things about the lcoe of building
[77:16] remotely deployed power assets is
[77:20] that the you get a better economic
[77:25] when like you yeah the economics work
[77:27] out better the longer that that power
[77:29] asset is in use so if you're only using
[77:31] it for 14 years to 20 years you're not
[77:34] going to get the full availability of
[77:37] what it has to offer whereas if we have
[77:39] those Bitcoin miners in play like they
[77:41] they just they they can come and go so
[77:43] quickly and easily to occupy that space
[77:45] when it's available and it's
[77:49] just they're yeah the the people that
[77:52] want to build these assets are they're
[77:55] they're going to start catching on
[77:55] sooner or later and that is kind of my
[77:57] mission like I want to start
[77:58] incorporating it into these like
[78:00] modeling efforts for hybrid Energy
[78:02] Systems because they they if they're not
[78:05] incorporating flexible computation like
[78:08] at like right now it's predominantly
[78:10] Bitcoin that does the flexible
[78:12] computation like there's no other load
[78:14] that I'm aware of that has these
[78:15] properties like there's other loads that
[78:16] have the flexibility that can be scaled
[78:20] but I where I see like well for example
[78:23] like like hydrogen desalination and like
[78:25] the synthetic hydrocarbons like all
[78:27] those can be like Turned Up and scaled
[78:29] up and down and power scaled dynamically
[78:31] when they're in use to make sure to
[78:33] capture any Excess power but where
[78:34] Bitcoin mining just dominates is the
[78:37] fact that it's dematerialized like if
[78:40] you're generating a product like whether
[78:43] it's hydrogen or if you're making steel
[78:45] or aluminum at a at a power plant in the
[78:48] middle of nowhere like like in Iceland
[78:50] for
[78:51] example you then have to you need
[78:54] storage and transportation for your feed
[78:56] stock and then you need storage and
[78:57] transportation for your final product
[78:59] you're not seeing the economic you're
[79:02] not realizing the economic value of that
[79:03] product that you're producing until you
[79:05] get it to a market that you can sell it
[79:06] to whereas with Bitcoin mining like it's
[79:10] available at to use anywhere in the
[79:12] world as soon as it's produced like you
[79:15] could have a Bitcoin mine in Iceland
[79:18] like just say yeah say you have like an
[79:19] s19 that's being hosted there and you
[79:21] just you've got your brains wallet and
[79:23] now they pay out in lightning so like
[79:24] every 10,000 SATs it just drops into
[79:26] your blink wallet and then you're in El
[79:28] Salvador hanging out at the hotel bar
[79:30] and you can just be like oh hey guys I
[79:31] just got my my most recent uh drop into
[79:35] my wallet from my miners up in Iceland
[79:36] let's buy around and like the fact that
[79:39] that is possible it's just like it's
[79:42] it's
[79:43] mindblowing but it's so too good to be
[79:46] true that it's hard to get some the
[79:49] people that will benefit most from it to
[79:50] engage with it because it's just it it
[79:52] seems unfathomable but
[79:55] it's here and and how it is
[79:58] here it's it's really cool um it's it's
[80:02] been uh already like almost one and a
[80:04] half hours I usually aim for like an
[80:06] hour I I kind of Overlook the time
[80:08] already it's been really interesting
[80:10] with you yeah well we spent 20 minutes
[80:13] talking about current events it's like
[80:16] how could you
[80:17] not it kind of I think we started like
[80:19] around 30 minutes to talk about uh the
[80:23] nuclear Energies like it it kind of
[80:25] postponed the whole schedule a little
[80:27] bit uh but I L it I L the the episode
[80:31] already um we have an end routine of
[80:34] consisting of two questions the one
[80:35] question is always the same question um
[80:38] and the question for you as the question
[80:40] that is always the same one is what can
[80:42] we learn from you besides Bitcoin which
[80:44] aims a little bit so we can get to know
[80:48] you in a different aspect uh and a
[80:50] different about me I'm just trying to be
[80:54] the best father and husband that I can
[80:56] be trying to better myself physically
[80:59] like trying to get back into doing
[81:01] Jiu-Jitsu I was doing it for a while but
[81:03] then I I hurt my ribs and kind of got
[81:04] out of it so I think I'm I'm back in
[81:07] condition that I can can go back and
[81:10] definitely yeah I used to stay fit but
[81:14] then I yeah I lost track of things so
[81:15] I'm starting to reinvigorate myself to
[81:19] to be exercising more to be meditating
[81:21] more to be just more attentive to the
[81:24] immediate needs in my immediate space
[81:27] because yeah despite all of the
[81:29] craziness in the world that can attract
[81:31] your attention it's it's focusing on
[81:35] what we have control of of in our
[81:38] immediate environments that that is the
[81:40] most important things that as far as I
[81:42] can tell all right interesting I also uh
[81:45] engage now more again since like half a
[81:48] year was kind of sloppy with my exercise
[81:50] and now I I started again uh because
[81:53] it's like if
[81:55] if you really want to uh do something
[81:57] great in in in the world you you have to
[81:59] do something great for your body first
[82:01] it's
[82:02] like clean up your room before you
[82:04] criticize the world so get your own
[82:06] Affairs in order yes very important um
[82:10] yeah our end routine is where the
[82:12] previous guest is asking a question for
[82:14] the next guest without knowing who the
[82:15] next guest actually is and that's an
[82:17] interesting one uh interesting question
[82:19] from the previous guest for you how
[82:21] would you orange pill someone if you
[82:24] cannot mention the monetary aspect of
[82:27] Bitcoin how do you orange pill without
[82:30] well like I definitely have gotten
[82:32] pretty good at talking about Bitcoin
[82:34] without actually talking about Bitcoin
[82:36] because everybody's everybody's kind of
[82:40] aware that something is horribly wrong
[82:42] but nobody can really identify the
[82:45] causal source of it all so so it's just
[82:48] I've gotten quite Adept at connecting
[82:51] almost every social ill right back to
[82:54] the money there's always a thread that
[82:56] connects to there is just something
[82:58] wrong with the technology that we use as
[83:01] our money and and it it's often comes
[83:04] down to finding the specific topic that
[83:07] is most important to the individual that
[83:09] you're talking to so sometimes it does
[83:11] require a little bit of probing and you
[83:12] can't just go like right right into like
[83:15] ah the Bitcoin fixes this like you have
[83:16] to do do a little bit of navigating
[83:19] around what their their interests are
[83:21] and finding where it's negatively
[83:25] impacted by the just the negative
[83:29] incentives that are embedded in in the
[83:30] Fiat structure that's just siphoning our
[83:33] energy from us it just it feels like
[83:35] when when you start describing it to
[83:37] people that that the money is literally
[83:39] like almost a parasitic force on
[83:41] Humanity it's that tends to at least get
[83:45] their attention but what I've noticed
[83:47] like there's a there's a concept in
[83:50] chemistry known as activation energy
[83:53] where it's like some chemical reactions
[83:55] when you when you put the the elements
[83:57] together they will immediately react
[83:58] whereas in other instances it requires
[84:01] an energy input into that system in
[84:03] order for the reaction to take place and
[84:06] if you don't exceed that activation
[84:07] energy the reaction will never actually
[84:09] start but once you get past that that
[84:11] point then it becomes self-fulfilling
[84:14] and the reaction itself will carry with
[84:17] it it its own energy and pursue like
[84:20] itself right to the its logical end
[84:23] point where it ends up reaching in
[84:24] equilibrium right I kind of been
[84:26] relating that somehow to to Bringing
[84:30] these new ideas to people where you have
[84:33] to kind of break through like a an
[84:37] anchoring bias or a level of cognitive
[84:39] dissidence that that's uh that just
[84:41] exists in everyone because we've we've
[84:43] all been exposed to things that that
[84:45] turn out to be like not as true as we've
[84:50] been led to believe and it takes a lot
[84:52] of effort to to get people to
[84:56] re-evaluate their world view on these
[84:58] complex topics especially when it comes
[85:00] comes to money and energy so it's it's
[85:03] just yeah finding finding the right way
[85:05] to approach any individual because every
[85:08] Everything connects back to yeah where
[85:11] how we store our wealth how we use our
[85:14] energy and how we uh present ourselves
[85:17] in the
[85:19] world that's uh that's very true and uh
[85:23] and uh
[85:25] a cool cool angle of of looking at it um
[85:28] before I let you go before we sign off
[85:30] where can people find you if they have
[85:32] additional question because like we we
[85:33] covered a lot and I think we sometimes
[85:35] we we like to go deeper where can people
[85:37] find your stuff where can people ask
[85:39] your questions yeah on X I go by nuclear
[85:42] bitcoiner I'm also on Noster and as
[85:45] everyone tends to say lately it's like I
[85:46] should be using it more I want to be
[85:48] using it more and I can often be found
[85:51] in the the Thursday morning Twitter
[85:53] space it's hosted by uh the uh the uh
[85:57] what the the Dorman and macro
[86:00] minutes and yeah that's basically where
[86:03] I spend most of my social media time and
[86:06] yeah anybody that wants to reach out
[86:08] those are those are always the best
[86:09] resources and I love talking about this
[86:11] stuff and anybody that wants to go go
[86:14] deep I'm more than happy to uh provide
[86:17] any resources that they're looking for
[86:19] especially like podcasts anybody that
[86:20] wants to go into deep into nuclear the
[86:23] decoupled podcast is probably my go-to
[86:26] recommendation for anybody yeah thank
[86:27] you for for joining us today thank you
[86:29] for for being here and also for everyone
[86:31] watching and listening thank you for
[86:33] joining us today I'll be back as always
[86:35] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
[86:37] yeah thanks for having me that was fun
[86:40] [Music]
