[00:00] do you think that the the Fiat system
[00:02] could survive the next 100 years
[00:04] measured in uh Bitcoin Fiat is going to
[00:06] zero how many Sates how many Bitcoins
[00:10] does someone need if you have 250,000
[00:12] then you have as much as on average
[00:15] every person can
[00:17] have what is the most important problem
[00:21] do you think that Bitcoin solves and and
[00:24] why is Bitcoin like the best solution
[00:25] for that all right so uh I see that uh
[00:30] you read the
[00:31] article so uh um the most important
[00:35] thing is uh for me
[00:38] measuring uh economic
[00:41] measuring and uh uh the reason
[00:45] why societies are
[00:48] so um
[00:51] disorganized and um and bad is is
[00:54] because of uh there's no measuring tool
[00:57] that is reliable
[01:00] uh economic from economic
[01:03] perspective and the first tool that we
[01:06] have is Bitcoin
[01:09] basically uh the way I came to to this
[01:12] is um is
[01:14] through uh through my
[01:16] activities uh because I started
[01:21] to I invested in in in Bitcoin about six
[01:24] years
[01:25] ago and uh I said okay I'm okay and
[01:31] uh I'm set everything's fine but how do
[01:34] I help the others how do how do you help
[01:37] people around me to get Bitcoin to
[01:40] understand
[01:41] Bitcoin and uh and I tried many things
[01:45] and
[01:46] then I
[01:48] was asking myself what is the one thing
[01:53] that everybody needs or would need even
[01:57] people who don't have any savings
[02:00] because if if among the Bitcoin people
[02:04] uh you see some podcasts and talking
[02:07] about people talking about uh investing
[02:10] and how where to where you put your
[02:12] savings but what about the people who
[02:14] don't have any
[02:16] savings do they is Bitcoin for them any
[02:21] in any any way good or
[02:24] useful and uh and then after this
[02:28] question I came to the conclusion that
[02:31] economic
[02:33] measuring is the is the thing that
[02:36] everybody needs even even people who
[02:40] don't have savings because what we do as
[02:45] humans we make a lot of decisions we we
[02:49] are make making decisions every time all
[02:53] all
[02:54] day and uh to make decisions we need to
[02:59] First uh be able to compare or
[03:04] measure and uh if the tool we measure
[03:08] with
[03:10] is
[03:13] bad every next step every following step
[03:17] is going to be distorted so um so yeah
[03:22] measuring interesting it's also
[03:24] interesting for me when I think of uh a
[03:26] Bitcoin standard that um where people
[03:29] people don't have like people who don't
[03:31] have a disposable income a lot of people
[03:33] say to like ah but what what are they
[03:35] doing what are people doing do they not
[03:38] even having the possibility to uh save
[03:40] in uh in in in
[03:43] Bitcoin but then you have to imagine
[03:45] like what are we on a Bitcoin standard
[03:48] when everything is on a Bitcoin standard
[03:50] and everyone is measuring also
[03:52] everything in Sates or micro satos or
[03:56] whatever um all prices go down over time
[04:01] like the bananas in the supermarket will
[04:03] be a little bit cheaper in a year when
[04:05] we are on a Bitcoin standard because we
[04:07] get better in producing that banana so
[04:10] if you have an income that is not dis
[04:13] disposable right now and you keep that
[04:16] same income in Bitcoin you will have a
[04:19] disposable income at some point because
[04:21] prices fall uh which is also an
[04:23] interesting um aspect of of having that
[04:26] um do you have like an uh time frame or
[04:30] like something we like when this happens
[04:33] we switch to bitcoin as a unit of
[04:36] account is is because for means like bit
[04:38] Bitcoin as a unitive account is the last
[04:40] step in the way then we can really in a
[04:43] Bitcoin uh world do you have like a time
[04:46] frame or like a um this event has to
[04:49] happen or when this happens then Bitcoin
[04:51] will be uni of account do you have
[04:53] something like
[04:54] that um U great question what I what I
[04:59] try to do
[05:00] and what I'm working on is imagine a
[05:03] world without Bitcoin and trying to work
[05:07] backwards so uh uh my I'm not concerned
[05:12] with
[05:13] Fiat the uh the step when I'm uh
[05:18] concerned with Fiat if I have to if I'm
[05:21] forced to pay something in
[05:24] Fiat then I okay I pay what I have to
[05:28] pay in Fiat because that's it but
[05:31] otherwise I am uh I am living in a world
[05:35] without Fiat in my mind and trying to uh
[05:40] find
[05:41] implications and trying to that's the
[05:44] vision that's that's what I I Envision
[05:48] come back to the present and trying to
[05:51] find the road or the
[05:55] Alternatives how to get
[05:57] there and then trying to to find ways to
[06:01] explain that to other people so um so I
[06:06] leave out
[06:07] uh um Fiat entirely from my thinking so
[06:12] to answer your question for me uh Fiat
[06:17] stops to exist for you
[06:21] personally when you stop thinking in
[06:24] it what I used to do in uh in Twitter is
[06:28] uh I I used to hashtag Bitcoin mindset
[06:32] all the time and this is what I'm
[06:34] thinking you can your your aim can be to
[06:40] maximize your wealth
[06:43] measured in
[06:45] Fiat or measured in
[06:48] Bitcoin but if we are
[06:51] bitcoiners why do we go back even
[06:54] hardcore bitcoiners even those who even
[06:57] Michael sailor uh he is
[07:00] he um uh
[07:03] showing the the increase of the price of
[07:06] of uh micro strategy in
[07:11] Fiat why I understand why because other
[07:14] people think think like that and of
[07:16] course there's then there's the the the
[07:19] reasoning that okay I start thinking in
[07:22] Bitcoin when the majority of the people
[07:26] of people start thinking in Bitcoin
[07:30] but you have to lead I think and you
[07:33] have to start and you have to be the
[07:34] leader and show the show
[07:37] the uh show the
[07:40] road so so you are um right now trying
[07:44] to like if you because for me I'm also
[07:48] having this goal uh I have a Bitcoin
[07:51] stack and I'm comparing it year over
[07:55] year is got a got it bigger like that
[07:57] that's that's how uh I think about my
[07:59] net worth uh in Bitcoin in Bitcoin
[08:02] exactly yeah yeah and but when it comes
[08:05] to purchasing it's just really hard for
[08:08] me to think in Bitcoin because
[08:10] everything is priced in in in uh in
[08:13] Euros uh everything is discussed in
[08:16] Euros everything is um um yeah just
[08:19] spoken about Euros so it's really hard
[08:21] for me to like oh what how many Sates
[08:24] are that and how many uh how many Sates
[08:27] are am I giving for that banana how many
[08:30] sores am I giving for that restaurant
[08:33] visit uh do you have that or are you
[08:36] trying to like always calculate what
[08:38] that is in in
[08:40] Bitcoin no uh the thing I realize it it
[08:44] is it is enough I I try to make things
[08:47] simple uh it is enough to realize that
[08:50] anytime
[08:52] you pay with
[08:54] Bitcoin you uh from an economic point of
[08:58] view you make a bad
[09:00] deal which doesn't mean that uh you
[09:04] shouldn't pay in Bitcoin because uh if
[09:07] you have to pay something anyways then
[09:11] at that
[09:12] moment it's not an issue whether whether
[09:15] you you buy buy that thing in Bitcoin or
[09:20] before that you convert to Fiat and and
[09:22] buy for Fiat but strictly from an
[09:26] economic point of view you're making all
[09:28] the time you make
[09:30] uh bad deal because the value uh and
[09:33] this this this might bring me to to to
[09:36] uh an important Point there's difference
[09:38] between price and value and uh price is
[09:42] what you pay and value is what you
[09:44] get but we we usually equate uh in
[09:49] everyday thinking we equate those two
[09:51] okay what's the price what's the value
[09:53] that's the same it's not the
[09:55] same I I saw that you've been you've
[09:58] been involved in in some some uh buying
[10:01] and selling stocks I mean I I I read
[10:05] that somewhere yeah I was in in stocks
[10:08] before Bitcoin all right I did the same
[10:11] so if you invest in stocks you have to
[10:14] uh compare two things if you are a
[10:17] long-term if you are an investor you
[10:19] have to compare the price and you have
[10:22] to compare the
[10:23] value uh the price is uh is available
[10:27] anytime on your screen if if if if if
[10:30] there's a if if it's a publicly uh
[10:32] traded company the price is there value
[10:35] is a different
[10:37] thing uh to get to the value you have to
[10:40] make uh conclusion by yourself based on
[10:46] your thinking based on your uh reasoning
[10:51] and if you calculate the
[10:55] value only then you compare the value to
[10:58] the price and if the price is is uh
[11:01] smaller than their value then
[11:03] potentially that's a good
[11:05] investment right so uh this implies that
[11:10] value and price are not the same it's
[11:12] it's it's so important that distinguish
[11:14] because um a lot of people confuse that
[11:17] uh price and value I see it all the time
[11:20] that people are like oh but uh the most
[11:24] frustrating thing for me is uh when
[11:27] people look at a unit price
[11:29] and not look at the whole value I was
[11:33] always really Furious when people
[11:35] compared unit prices of stocks like oh
[11:37] this stock is
[11:39] 2,000 EUR and that is just 20 that is so
[11:42] much cheaper no you have to look at the
[11:44] market capitalization and the whole uh
[11:47] thing also with Bitcoin you cannot just
[11:49] look at one Bitcoin what is one Bitcoin
[11:51] worth you have to look at the whole
[11:52] Market valuation uh and what do we think
[11:55] is the total Market uh total addressable
[11:58] Market uh and what is bitcoin right now
[12:01] um uh and this is also something that
[12:04] you you sent me actually that uh you
[12:06] think that the total addressable Market
[12:08] is basically just the world just every
[12:10] person uh which I'm also a big believer
[12:13] in um and there you uh wrote in the
[12:17] article uh what was it 200,000 something
[12:20] 260,000 Sates I think you came to do the
[12:24] calculation per person um which is an
[12:29] and a question that I ask quite a lot um
[12:32] how many Sates how many
[12:34] Bitcoins does someone need what like
[12:37] what is the goal that someone should for
[12:40] uh if if they like now just starting out
[12:43] they I don't know they're 25 they maybe
[12:45] 35 whatever their age is and they're
[12:48] having now zero Bitcoin and they want to
[12:50] reach enough Bitcoin so they can be um
[12:54] wealthy or they can be normal wealth
[12:58] level in a Bitcoin
[12:59] uh world what is 260,000 the average or
[13:03] do you is that the number also that you
[13:05] would shoot for or is it higher like
[13:07] 260,000 is right now just not even 200
[13:10] EUR I think yeah yeah yeah it's about
[13:13] 160 or something Euros right now um I
[13:16] think for every person it's different
[13:19] and uh and um uh I always uh tell people
[13:25] when they ask me that their Bitcoin STX
[13:29] should be uh um according to their
[13:34] understanding of Bitcoin uh if somebody
[13:38] doesn't understand Bitcoin he he looks
[13:40] at it as as gambling probably or or or
[13:44] uh get rich quick
[13:46] scheme and then uh then they they
[13:49] shouldn't put too much into it something
[13:52] and then start start
[13:54] learning uh then after after people
[13:58] understand uh they
[14:00] will from themselves they will come to
[14:03] the conclusion the more the
[14:05] better uh the there 260,000
[14:10] satosi Sates which I which I
[14:15] um uh adjusted to
[14:18] 250,000 just because it's a it's an
[14:20] easier number to to remember and and
[14:24] basically it's number of satosi divided
[14:28] by a number of people on the planet so
[14:32] let's say it's 250,000 more or less okay
[14:36] and uh if we if we take this
[14:41] 250,000 um I lost I lost what what what
[14:44] what I wanted to say uh yeah if you have
[14:48] 250,000 then you have as much
[14:52] as on average every person can have
[14:59] and if Bitcoin is going to be uh the
[15:04] global uh reliable measuring
[15:10] tool
[15:12] then the 250,000
[15:15] Sates must measure
[15:18] everything that the person a person
[15:22] has so the 250,000 is everything that a
[15:27] person has on the average of course
[15:29] so if you have 250,000
[15:32] Sates you are as an average person
[15:36] globally you have you have wealth as an
[15:39] average person globally now if you
[15:41] understand Bitcoin more and if you want
[15:43] to shoot for more then uh uh then you
[15:47] buy more but the mindblowing thing about
[15:50] this is that what what you also said
[15:52] that you can still have 250,000 Satoshi
[15:56] for €60
[16:00] so that's that's just unbelievable yeah
[16:04] it's like buying the average uh well do
[16:07] do you know by heart I don't I have no
[16:10] number in my head do you know what the
[16:12] average uh wealth is right now on on on
[16:15] the planet when we look at per
[16:17] person I don't know I don't know I I
[16:20] just I I came to the conclusion I I was
[16:23] calculating but only only roughly in my
[16:26] in my mind okay let's say it's 10,000
[16:29] uh let's undershoot okay let's say it's
[16:31] € 10,000 EUR on the average per
[16:34] person okay and I think I think I I came
[16:38] to this conclusion maybe I'm wrong I
[16:40] don't know uh
[16:42] 10,000 now €10,000 you can buy 10,000
[16:46] for 200 I mean for
[16:50] 160 Euros
[16:52] that's it also gives in that question
[16:55] like when we look at Bitcoin long term
[16:58] and I know you probably don't do that
[17:00] and I also never did that um trying to
[17:03] figure out where bitcoin price will go
[17:05] because eventually they will not be a
[17:07] fat price as as as I see it so it does
[17:10] not really make sense to find out
[17:13] where's the gold price of Bitcoin as I
[17:16] did it always with stocks like there's
[17:17] different in stocks I was like oh when
[17:19] it hits that price or that valuation it
[17:21] maybe does not make sense for me to hold
[17:23] it I will diversify and other stuff um
[17:26] with Bitcoin it just does not make sense
[17:28] like that because you are part of a
[17:30] bigger Revolution part of a uh a way
[17:34] bigger thing uh and Bitcoin is the
[17:37] future money like you are investing now
[17:39] in the vehicle that will be uh the money
[17:42] in the future which is an amazing thing
[17:44] to think about um but do do you have any
[17:48] number in your head uh where Bitcoin
[17:52] should go when we have that uh every
[17:56] person has Bitcoin we have Bitcoin as a
[17:58] unit of account we have Bitcoin as uh
[18:01] medum of exchange to of value and
[18:02] everything um obviously we don't value
[18:05] Bitcoin in that fat terms at that point
[18:08] but I think why a lot of people value
[18:11] things in Fiat right now is because it
[18:14] helps people to grasp grasp where
[18:17] Bitcoin is going I think uh uh even even
[18:22] making this assumption like oh what if
[18:25] everyone has Bitcoin how many Sates can
[18:27] everyone have this is a great way to
[18:29] even think about that uh but maybe do
[18:31] you have anything in field
[18:33] also what I have sorry if you have any
[18:38] um number in in in in mind for fat okay
[18:43] uh this brings me back to to to my to my
[18:46] original Point uh to to the Bitcoin
[18:48] mindset uh let's go back a little bit
[18:51] okay um humans uh tend to measure
[18:56] everything and uh if you want to measure
[18:59] the measuring tool has to be reliable in
[19:03] time and
[19:05] space so uh that's why we measure for
[19:08] example length in meters or centimeters
[19:13] or whatever
[19:15] uh which is the meter is reliable in
[19:20] time and space it cannot happen that in
[19:23] 100 years the meter will be
[19:26] different because it's set it is fixed
[19:30] and uh it's it's like that with anything
[19:33] we measure and the E economic uh
[19:36] measuring tool is the only thing where
[19:39] we fool ourselves and my my comparison
[19:43] used to be uh let's imagine that we
[19:46] measure length in bananas you take a
[19:49] banana measure the length of uh of a
[19:53] table and you come to 10
[19:56] bananas you take another banana or tell
[20:00] somebody call somebody okay let's
[20:02] measure that uh table the same table and
[20:05] he he measures it with a different
[20:06] banana and now it's 11 or
[20:10] 12 it's not
[20:12] reliable but we base our decisions on
[20:15] something that's not reliable okay so
[20:19] this implies the following the only
[20:22] reliable measuring
[20:25] tool for economic
[20:28] um
[20:30] value is
[20:32] Bitcoin because it's
[20:34] fixed so the
[20:37] question uh does make sense to ask the
[20:39] question what is the value of Bitcoin in
[20:44] something
[20:45] else Bitcoin is the measuring tool
[20:50] so I always used to say okay people say
[20:55] uh the the the value again the value of
[20:59] Bitcoin is 0,000 now it's not the value
[21:03] you cannot you cannot measure value with
[21:05] uh
[21:06] Fiat so you can do it the other way
[21:09] around so now I answer your
[21:12] question uh measured in Fiat I mean
[21:16] measured in uh in
[21:18] Bitcoin Fiat is going to
[21:22] zero that's it it's going to zero and
[21:25] it's going to zero because they are
[21:27] printing so much money and they cannot
[21:31] they cannot stop printing money because
[21:33] of the the setup of the whole financial
[21:35] system that is guaranteed our best
[21:38] marketing people are the the people from
[21:41] the fed and from the ECB and and all the
[21:44] central
[21:45] banks do you think that the the Fiat
[21:48] system could survive the next 100 years
[21:50] I don't know I I don't I don't care
[21:52] either I think I think uh uh we can make
[21:56] the switch
[21:58] we can we can make the switch in our
[22:02] minds stopping to think in uh Fiat
[22:07] that's just our
[22:08] decision you can do
[22:11] that okay uh similarly as you don't have
[22:15] to think in terms of length in bananas
[22:19] why would you there's the meter the same
[22:22] is here so I think if we want to Orange
[22:26] Peel as many people as possible
[22:29] this was my
[22:30] conclusion this is the door through
[22:33] which it is the easiest to explain
[22:36] Bitcoin I certainly agree
[22:38] like having that mindset in Bitcoin and
[22:41] thinking Bitcoin is so important uh
[22:44] which uh is is completely underrated we
[22:48] we have like you you always see when the
[22:50] price goes up or down on Twitter it's
[22:53] like oh price 60,000 65,000 we hit that
[22:56] that that uh and it it makes sense from
[23:00] a marketing perspective uh I'm in
[23:02] contact with a lot of exchanges also and
[23:05] they see it when the price
[23:07] moves no matter if it's down up or down
[23:11] Bitcoin uh uh bitcoiners are buying a
[23:13] lot more if the price is stable and just
[23:17] like goes sideways people are not buying
[23:20] as much Bitcoin so so yeah that's that's
[23:23] typical typical herd mental mentality
[23:26] it's uh that's that's how we are wired
[23:28] you know uh being uh before having been
[23:32] an investor in into um uh companies I
[23:37] train myself to to withstand these
[23:41] things and go against the the
[23:44] 80% but then it's it's not that easy
[23:47] because you have to be correct you have
[23:49] to be uh you have to be able to say to
[23:52] the other people that you are wrong and
[23:54] you have to be correct then then you can
[23:57] buy uh value for for a great price but
[24:02] usually if prices go down everybody is
[24:04] get everybody gets frightened and has a
[24:08] tendency to sell and if the price goes
[24:10] up everybody has a tendency to
[24:13] buy absolutely you make a good deal when
[24:16] the price is down and not up if you are
[24:18] listening to this podcast you might be
[24:20] wondering what is actually the setup
[24:22] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[24:25] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[24:27] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[24:29] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[24:31] right way let's focus on the first thing
[24:33] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[24:36] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[24:38] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[24:40] an exchange that has an own token or
[24:42] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[24:44] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[24:47] for me the best partner for that and now
[24:51] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[24:53] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[24:55] a self custody solution where you
[24:58] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[25:01] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[25:04] Solutions that's a bit box you just put
[25:07] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[25:09] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[25:13] Bitcoin harders if you have more than
[25:16] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[25:19] have one last thing before we get back
[25:21] to the video I'm really passionate about
[25:23] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[25:25] amazing opportunity in middle of Eur
[25:28] Europe in June the Bitcoin BR conference
[25:31] it's the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[25:34] conference in whole of Europe for all
[25:37] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[25:39] this place in June for all europees it's
[25:41] a must go anyways you are so close to
[25:44] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[25:46] have to come I will do interviews there
[25:49] and I would love to meet you all there
[25:51] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[25:54] get discounts and use the links down in
[25:57] the description yeah as the saying never
[26:00] catch a falling knife but I always did
[26:02] that with with with my stock Investments
[26:05] ah okay I love that when it was going
[26:08] going down and it uh it seemed like a
[26:11] really good deal I was really early on
[26:14] in in in Tesla and this was like this
[26:16] this first big investment that I made on
[26:18] and it was half a year it was just going
[26:21] down uh there was like 50 or 60% even
[26:24] going down uh and I kept investing kept
[26:27] investing kept investing in and
[26:29] afterwards like it shot up like I think
[26:31] in in total it was like thousand or
[26:33] 1,200% something for me in in in in like
[26:36] three years or something like that
[26:37] really crazy number uh but yeah it's
[26:40] it's you always try to think of the
[26:44] fundamental value the underlying value
[26:47] what what does this bring to me and this
[26:49] is also something in in Bitcoin uh when
[26:52] when you have Bitcoin and you value
[26:53] everything in Bitcoin you value time
[26:55] differently you value what you do and
[26:58] what you buy differently because you're
[26:59] like this this costs me a lot of Sates
[27:02] like if if I do that do I really want to
[27:06] uh to to do that uh which brings me to
[27:09] my my next question um when we now
[27:12] imagine everyone is on a Bitcoin
[27:14] standard like we have this we got rid of
[27:17] Fiat somehow and and people live on this
[27:20] low time preference deflationary sound
[27:22] money system uh called
[27:25] Bitcoin what what do you think does this
[27:27] with soci what do you think are the
[27:30] implications um for our world on that or
[27:33] are there even changes like is does it
[27:36] even change uh something uh in in in the
[27:39] broader sense or will people still be
[27:43] people uh I'm positive about this uh of
[27:47] course this
[27:48] 8020 uh distribution is uh is U is is is
[27:54] seems to be
[27:56] working uh empirically it seems to be
[27:59] working so I think 80% of the people are
[28:03] followers and uh the rest the 20%
[28:09] usually fight out the what's what's
[28:12] going to happen you know and uh if if we
[28:18] look at look at the the the fight around
[28:22] Bitcoin like this then we have to fight
[28:25] the 20% I mean uh we have to be able to
[28:29] to persuade that the 80% by uh by uh
[28:35] having an upper an upper hand in this
[28:39] 20% okay so if Bitcoin wins and it will
[28:44] win it win it wins already it is winning
[28:47] already then uh it has it has some some
[28:51] implications for everybody you
[28:55] cannot uh go or do without changing your
[29:01] priorities so you have to go people will
[29:05] this is my view I think people will go
[29:08] deeper uh into themselves and and
[29:12] change uh and evaluate what is really
[29:17] important and what is not
[29:19] important of
[29:21] course everybody has to go his own way I
[29:24] I tell you for example from from myself
[29:26] I I was in a situation
[29:28] back
[29:30] couple a lot of years ago when I uh when
[29:35] I was uh in a good uh financial position
[29:39] from from one day to the other basically
[29:43] and I didn't know how to handle that and
[29:47] I thought that okay let's spend
[29:50] proportionately
[29:52] more because I have prop I have more
[29:55] than I had before and I I was uh just
[29:59] finding some
[30:02] uh let's say
[30:05] destructions to to buy you know oh let's
[30:09] let's do this let's do that because I
[30:11] have the money but I don't need it but
[30:14] okay let's do that because I have the
[30:16] money but for life you you need uh uh
[30:21] other things uh mostly things that you
[30:24] cannot buy with uh with money so uh
[30:28] you won't be able to respect yourself
[30:31] when you have more money or if your
[30:34] self-respect depends on how much wealth
[30:38] you have then you will not have enough
[30:41] wealth never so that then you have to
[30:45] work in yourself uh on yourself and uh
[30:49] and solve these issues or you cannot buy
[30:52] for example you cannot buy uh family you
[30:55] cannot buy friends
[30:58] and you cannot buy
[31:00] Health even so I think I think Society
[31:04] needs to
[31:05] change and I think uh through Bitcoin it
[31:09] will change through that uh low time
[31:12] preference uh mindset and this kind of
[31:16] proof of work mindset uh you think right
[31:20] sorry it will change like I'm always
[31:22] asking like why like why does it change
[31:27] because there's like this low time
[31:29] preference it fixes the incentives of
[31:31] people because all of a sudden people
[31:33] thinking more longterm when they on a
[31:35] Bitcoin standard versus when they are on
[31:37] a on a Fiat standard when they on a Fiat
[31:39] standard they kind of incentivized to
[31:42] spend now they're spending earlier
[31:44] because Fe is depreciating in value so
[31:47] they have to spend the money a little
[31:50] earlier when they are on a Bitcoin
[31:52] standard uh their value of Bitcoin or
[31:55] the value the purchasing power uh goes
[31:57] up in time so they are incentivized to
[32:00] not spend it now and spend it later is
[32:05] are you seeing that as the reason why um
[32:08] it it it fixes like the world a little
[32:11] bit Yeah it it because it doesn't make
[32:14] doesn't make sense to to overspend
[32:16] because uh it will have uh long term it
[32:19] your decisions will have uh negative
[32:22] consequences in the
[32:24] future so uh that's why yeah yeah
[32:27] amazing
[32:28] um and we always say like time is the
[32:31] most scarce thing and Bitcoin is like
[32:35] second to that and for me Bitcoin is
[32:39] almost almost as valuable as time it's
[32:42] kind of a measuring tool for time uh if
[32:45] you put in the proof of work you get
[32:47] Bitcoin out of there uh and then uh you
[32:50] can spend that time that you spend in
[32:52] there that you saved in Bitcoin then you
[32:55] can spend it again for more time time
[32:58] because then you can do do something
[33:00] with that um is maybe it's a weird
[33:04] question but when when when time is the
[33:07] most scarce and most valuable asset and
[33:09] Bitcoin is number number two is there a
[33:12] number
[33:13] three I don't
[33:15] know I don't know I I think
[33:18] um uh yeah from a from a spirital point
[33:22] of view I think a valuable thing is uh
[33:25] understanding really really
[33:27] understanding the deeply life uh
[33:29] yourself uh how you fit in the hole
[33:34] and uh and that's that's really valuable
[33:38] from from an from a perspective
[33:40] individual
[33:42] perspective that's that's really
[33:44] important really because because you
[33:46] know everything we do uh we do through
[33:49] our own uh glasses or own lenses so if
[33:54] our own lenses are not clean
[33:58] and then we will see distorted uh life
[34:01] uh or we'll see life distorted in a
[34:03] distorted way so that's that's why it's
[34:07] it's really I I would say that's number
[34:10] three but maybe not in this order I
[34:13] don't know I I I love it a lot
[34:17] um when we now think of the
[34:19] transitioning time uh we have now
[34:22] Bitcoin as this Niche thing uh only a
[34:25] few people have it uh and fear that
[34:27] that's this big thing uh and at some
[34:31] point Fiat will be gone or really small
[34:34] part of econ our economy and Bitcoin
[34:37] will be the big thing I there's a really
[34:40] cool um picture with a horses and bit
[34:44] and cars in New York City it was in the
[34:47] beginning of the 1900s or
[34:49] 1800s uh I don't know exactly when it
[34:52] was I'm not good in History
[34:53] unfortunately but it was like two
[34:56] pictures and they were like 10 uh years
[34:59] uh apart from each other the first
[35:01] picture showed there were only horses
[35:03] and one two cars on the road and the
[35:06] second pictures 10 years later there
[35:08] were only cars on the road and one two
[35:11] horses uh and when you have technology
[35:14] and this es adoption because the
[35:16] technology Moves In in similar Cycles
[35:19] when they adopting um I I I can imagine
[35:23] that Bitcoin will be adopted in a really
[35:27] fast manner when when we hit a certain
[35:30] point all of the sudden in like 10 15
[35:33] years adoption will grow a lot uh we are
[35:37] not there yet but we could be really
[35:40] quickly there I think um how do you see
[35:44] that transitioning phase of of of fear
[35:48] and and and Bitcoin and one part that is
[35:51] also really interesting we have now a
[35:53] lot of whales in in Bitcoin when you
[35:55] think of even normal people that are
[35:59] kind of normal in in in right now
[36:02] because they have like maybe two
[36:03] Bitcoins they will be really wealthy in
[36:06] in a Bitcoin standard with two Bitcoins
[36:08] when we think of like uh two Bitcoins
[36:11] are 200 million Sates and we just talked
[36:14] the average wealth on a Bitcoin standard
[36:16] will be like 200,000 Sates there's a big
[36:19] difference in there um how do you
[36:21] imagine that transitioning time and is
[36:23] it a problem that there's like a lot of
[36:25] whales how will that distribution go to
[36:27] have any um uh insights or any any blans
[36:31] for for that transitioning to the
[36:33] measuring uh thing of of Bitcoin okay uh
[36:37] first of all adoption adoption for me is
[36:40] a mental
[36:41] process people say adoption is buying
[36:44] Bitcoin no adoption is a mental process
[36:47] somebody could uh somebody could
[36:50] understand Bitcoin and have a uh Bitcoin
[36:53] mindset and uh and take Bitcoin as a as
[36:59] a measuring tool uh as opposed to Fiat
[37:02] and not own any Bitcoin which would be
[37:05] foolish because uh if he'd come to the
[37:08] these conclusions he'd he'd have Bitcoin
[37:12] but on its own uh adoption is a mental
[37:17] process it's understanding so now the
[37:21] question is similar to asking whether
[37:25] I'm uh maybe not the the best comparison
[37:28] but but
[37:30] nevertheless whether I'm bothered if uh
[37:34] the measuring stick for
[37:37] length is owned by somebody
[37:41] else I don't care because in my
[37:44] mind the most important thing is a fixed
[37:48] aspect of that thing that's why it can
[37:52] be a measuring uh
[37:55] tool Okay so
[37:58] so so no no problem the other question
[38:01] is whether it threatens the uh
[38:05] decentralized nature of Bitcoin but
[38:07] that's another question you know I'm
[38:10] assuming that uh
[38:13] Mankind and especially uh bitcoiners are
[38:18] wise enough to keep
[38:22] uh that intact Jeff W used to say if um
[38:27] Bitcoin stays uh
[38:30] decentralized uh and something else I
[38:32] don't know I don't remember now but if
[38:35] Bitcoin stays
[38:37] decentralized then uh it is the only
[38:42] reliable measuring tool reliable in time
[38:47] in space for money that's
[38:50] it yeah it's it's it's it's very very
[38:54] true uh for everyone watching I have a
[38:56] even a podcast episode with Jeff Bo on
[38:58] my channel if if if people want to watch
[39:00] that um yeah this is it's always the the
[39:04] point I I I come back to if if Bitcoin
[39:08] is the sound money and decentralized and
[39:11] all the properties that we think it is
[39:13] and I truly think that it is obviously
[39:17] then we don't have to worry about
[39:19] anything uh we don't have to speak for
[39:22] Bitcoin I chose to speak for Bitcoin
[39:24] because I'm I'm really passionate about
[39:26] it and I like speaking about Bitcoin but
[39:28] I did not choose to speak for Bitcoin to
[39:30] defend Bitcoin or to enhance Bitcoin
[39:33] adoption I will do that because I'm
[39:36] doing it uh but it's not my primary goal
[39:40] uh and that's that's an really a mind
[39:43] shift uh towards uh from the stock
[39:46] market uh mindset where you try to
[39:49] convince other people like oh that stock
[39:51] is really good and stuff like I I I
[39:53] don't try to convince other people of of
[39:56] Bitcoin because if it is actually that
[39:58] what we think it is Bitcoin will
[40:00] convince everybody at some point people
[40:03] will come in naturally I still try to do
[40:05] a good job in educating drill try to do
[40:07] a good job in explaining and adopting uh
[40:10] with other people but we don't really
[40:12] have to do that yeah yeah it's uh it's
[40:14] it's pure logic you
[40:16] know uh so uh if you don't want to go to
[40:21] towards your logic then um then okay now
[40:24] that's why they say okay you you you buy
[40:28] Bitcoin for the price you deserve okay
[40:31] it's your decision absolutely um before
[40:34] we come to the end routine of the
[40:36] podcast uh one more one more question uh
[40:39] what are you currently passionate about
[40:41] besides Bitcoin is there anything that
[40:42] you're learning uh is there anything
[40:44] that you are doing uh any activity or or
[40:48] topic that you're diving into uh besides
[40:52] Bitcoin uh I uh I do it this constantly
[40:56] I'm I'm I'm constantly thinking and I'm
[41:00] thinking about various things I'm I'm
[41:04] a loan guy from from this point of view
[41:07] I'm I'm just uh in my head and thinking
[41:11] about Concepts and mental models and
[41:14] trying to understand deeply uh questions
[41:17] so there are some on Parallel
[41:21] some some some problems that I'm trying
[41:24] to to understand or
[41:28] solve uh one of them is the question of
[41:31] understanding the relationship
[41:33] between
[41:35] uh myself and and the whole and the
[41:39] universe this is uh this is one topic
[41:43] then I'm really I'm really uh I I really
[41:47] like football because I was I was
[41:48] playing football when I was a kid and
[41:51] then um uh it remained my passion so I
[41:58] am uh trying to to uh I actually started
[42:04] to to train kids about uh when was that
[42:08] a week ago small kids nine-year-old kids
[42:12] and and I I do it in a in a method that
[42:15] is uh that is different from from all
[42:17] the methods or most of the methods that
[42:20] they use uh uh around me and uh and also
[42:25] but that's also an interestingly a
[42:27] philosophical question for me how to how
[42:30] to teach kids or people in a way that
[42:35] the focus is their comprehension and not
[42:40] what and how I would like to convey my
[42:44] message so so this is also also one of
[42:47] the things okay and and and and
[42:50] sometimes sometimes just mental models
[42:53] in in uh some some article uh smaller
[42:59] smaller
[43:00] subject think all the time uh so who do
[43:05] you think will win the European
[43:06] Championship this year in in Germany are
[43:08] you are you watching games there yes I
[43:11] will watch watch games but I'm I don't
[43:14] care I don't I don't care I'm looking at
[43:16] football as a strategic
[43:18] game and I'm trying to understand it as
[43:22] a strategic game and see how it could be
[43:26] improved as a strategic game it has be
[43:29] it it improved a
[43:31] lot through through the the last X years
[43:35] and it will improve
[43:37] more amazing thank you thank you um now
[43:40] let's come to the end routine of the
[43:42] podcast where the previous guest is
[43:43] asking a question for the next guest
[43:45] without knowing who the next guest
[43:46] actually is uh and your question is if
[43:49] you have to make the choice between only
[43:53] lightning transactions or only Bitcoin
[43:55] onchain transactions for the rest of
[43:57] your life which one would you choose and
[44:02] why only lightning or it depends it
[44:07] depends only one you can choose only one
[44:09] yeah yeah the question is uh a really
[44:12] interesting one uh but yeah only only
[44:15] one between the lightning transactions
[44:17] and the Bitcoin transactions for the
[44:18] rest of your life yeah I do lightning
[44:22] transactions because my logic is that I
[44:24] I'm not uh ready to and I will not sell
[44:27] my my core
[44:29] position and if I don't want to sell my
[44:33] core position then I will not do any any
[44:37] uh uh online trans I mean uh Bas layer
[44:42] transactions and uh if I need to pay
[44:45] something in Bitcoin I will do it on
[44:47] lightning and I will when I will earn
[44:50] some Bitcoin I will earn it and put it
[44:52] on lightning and I'll spend it replace
[44:55] spend and and and replace
[44:58] perfect uh then uh before I let you go
[45:02] uh where is the best way for people to
[45:05] reach out to you where's the best way
[45:07] for people to ask you
[45:09] questions uh I'm on Twitter uh at Roland
[45:13] k o v a
[45:17] cs68 uh you can find me there I'm I'm
[45:20] I'm doing a lot of
[45:22] posting and uh and that's it
[45:25] basically perfect and uh thank you
[45:27] Roland and for everyone watching uh
[45:29] thank you for watching I'll be back
[45:31] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
[45:33] thank you for the opportunity
