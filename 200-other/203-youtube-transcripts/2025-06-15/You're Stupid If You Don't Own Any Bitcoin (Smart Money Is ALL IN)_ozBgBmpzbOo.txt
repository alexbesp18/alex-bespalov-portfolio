[00:00] it's going to be stupid for any sort of
[00:01] investor Financial professional not to
[00:03] have an allocation to it and the math is
[00:05] starting to support us on that you're
[00:07] more at risk not owning it than you are
[00:09] owning it Bitcoin needs to be a 20 to 50
[00:11] trillion do asset the amount of adoption
[00:13] that we witnessed over the past year
[00:15] completely blew my expectations we're at
[00:16] a major inflection point these days
[00:18] Bitcoin solves all the problems I care
[00:19] about in the world and it's very infant
[00:22] and there's so many massive massive
[00:24] implications that are going to come from
[00:25] the growth of this asset over time and
[00:27] this thing's going to change the world
[00:28] Bitcoin was able throughout history to
[00:31] take all these benefits that we got when
[00:33] we centralized infrastructure around
[00:35] money and improve upon that and still do
[00:38] it in a decentralized architecture
[00:39] eventually we're going to hit this
[00:40] medium exchange explosion it's very
[00:42] simple to own massive amounts of wealth
[00:44] in it and it's permissionless you don't
[00:45] have to move it over to the Swift
[00:46] Network you don't have to physically
[00:48] deliver it like gold bars and have those
[00:50] verified it's actually just like kind of
[00:52] like an ideal optimal wave storing
[00:54] wealth who' have thought we're a$2
[00:55] trillion asset playing with the big boys
[00:57] but we aren't near the top of the
[00:59] pecking order and once we get towards
[01:01] the top of the pecking order that's when
[01:03] Bitcoin takes over Sovereign wealth
[01:04] assets over the long term there's a very
[01:06] strong case to be made that will end up
[01:08] in a Bitcoin denominated Global neutral
[01:11] system that emerged from private
[01:13] [Music]
[01:17] markets hi Eric how you doing everything
[01:19] fine on your end uh good man I'm busy
[01:22] it's a it's a crazy time and all good
[01:25] problems to have but there is a ton
[01:27] happening in Bitcoin and I think we're
[01:28] at a major inflection point these days
[01:30] days interesting um you also talked
[01:33] before before we started recording about
[01:34] like the impact for businesses and what
[01:36] you're doing with with VC stuff um I
[01:40] want to get into the the full stuff of
[01:42] like what the impact for businesses for
[01:44] Bitcoin also will be long term and and
[01:46] the banking sector and all that stuff uh
[01:49] but maybe for the people that that don't
[01:50] know you like what's your background
[01:52] what are you currently doing in Bitcoin
[01:54] and what is kind of your role in there
[01:56] yeah yeah so I mean my I I I can give
[01:59] you kind of the whole story of how I got
[02:01] involved yeah um yes I love economics
[02:06] like economics was just something
[02:09] that I guess I love philosophy and um
[02:13] economics is kind of like the most
[02:15] quantifiable form of philosophy to me
[02:18] and um and that was something that was
[02:20] just always a hobby of mine in college I
[02:22] studied finance and econ I wanted to
[02:24] work in finance um and I wanted to work
[02:27] in like the private Equity world I think
[02:30] um I always just kind of read about
[02:33] economics on the side and while I was
[02:35] majoring in it you know I got my
[02:37] standard keyan education through
[02:39] undergrad and I was lucky enough to have
[02:41] been introduced to other areas of
[02:42] thought that I was reading about over
[02:44] Christmas break and an audio books when
[02:46] I was driving and things like that and
[02:48] that always just gave me a very
[02:49] different view um of how I thought the
[02:52] world should be versus what it is today
[02:56] but nonetheless in terms of being
[02:57] pragmatic and trying to chese a career
[02:59] it's basic good it's like I you know I
[03:01] was very nihilistic when I was younger
[03:03] about um the future fate of the
[03:07] financial economy at a global level we
[03:10] go through these Cycles in history um
[03:12] there's been a ton of control over the
[03:14] monetary system that doesn't really
[03:16] change there is no solution to change it
[03:18] Gold's not really going to change that
[03:21] um and that's just the way it is so you
[03:23] kind of position your career into
[03:24] something that ultimately benefits from
[03:26] it and um and that's pretty much where I
[03:29] was so I worked for private Equity Fund
[03:31] we specialized in acquiring companies
[03:34] that would buy out like distressed or um
[03:38] declining assets so a company's
[03:40] struggling we would buy them out and try
[03:42] to like turn it around um something that
[03:44] I always expected would just be a
[03:47] necessity of um this type of boom and
[03:50] bus cycle economy over time it's a very
[03:53] profitable investment strategy I didn't
[03:56] understand Bitcoin I was never like a
[03:57] big technologist um
[04:00] much more in depth on the finance and
[04:01] economics side and you know the first
[04:04] time I heard about it I it was just
[04:07] posed as the technology was just like
[04:08] this is this cool blockchain technology
[04:10] that's emerged and I was like okay like
[04:13] look like that's interesting maybe
[04:14] there's something cool that can come
[04:15] from this I don't totally get it but um
[04:18] it's not something that I would invest
[04:20] in this token associated with it like I
[04:22] don't I don't get it um there's no cash
[04:25] flow standard Financial framework of
[04:27] thinking so I don't invest in things
[04:29] that can't really measure their value
[04:31] and that's where I was at for a number
[04:33] of years I didn't like hate it I didn't
[04:35] think it was stupid um I just was like I
[04:37] don't really get this and it's not the
[04:39] type of investing I
[04:40] do and then it wasn't until I had a
[04:43] close friend who kept pushing it on me
[04:45] and you know the the price was doing
[04:48] well at the time and all of that and I
[04:49] was just kind of like all right like
[04:51] I'll look into this a little bit more
[04:53] and it was some sort of like Reddit post
[04:55] that was like making an argument that
[04:56] it's an alternative to Central Banking
[04:59] and I think this was kind of around the
[05:00] time that the Bitcoin St or I guess it
[05:02] was a little bit before the Bitcoin
[05:04] standard actually came out um but like
[05:07] that narrative I was like oh that's
[05:08] that's an incredibly interesting concept
[05:10] because like at that point in
[05:12] time I was trying to think of ways of
[05:14] like you know what is the escape valve
[05:16] how can some of this end we were looking
[05:18] at like Japanese Equity markets their
[05:20] Central Bank at that time back in like
[05:22] um owned like 25% of the equity market
[05:25] and I was like this is absurd this isn't
[05:26] how markets are supposed to work there
[05:28] has to be some sort of mechanism of
[05:30] failure here and like looking into that
[05:32] I was just like I don't know what it is
[05:34] and I don't know when it's coming I
[05:35] don't know how we kind of invest around
[05:36] that outcome it's a lot easier to invest
[05:39] around the outcome of this game's just
[05:40] going to continue and it's you can make
[05:43] a lot more money until the Music Stops
[05:45] and then once I got deeper into Bitcoin
[05:49] that's when it clicked with me like oh
[05:50] this could be a potential Escape valve
[05:52] and then the questions all flow in of oh
[05:55] how you know the government's going to
[05:57] stop this thing though and then I spent
[05:58] some time thinking through that that and
[05:59] then I started to get my head around
[06:01] like oh this is actually a very
[06:02] challenging thing for the government to
[06:04] stop and back then the case wasn't quite
[06:06] as clear in my head that um you know the
[06:09] cost of like a 51% attack or something
[06:11] like that was high enough for it to
[06:13] potentially just like outright end it
[06:15] took me a while to get my head around
[06:16] while that isn't necessarily the primary
[06:19] argument um but once I got comfortable
[06:24] with kind of the risks around it you
[06:26] know I got a lot more interested and
[06:27] then I was kind of like oh what about
[06:29] all these other cryptocurrencies oh
[06:30] ethereum does what Bitcoin does but it's
[06:33] um it does more stuff and I you know
[06:36] spent like a year reading into different
[06:39] you know consensus mechanisms proof of
[06:41] stake delegated proof of stake and I was
[06:43] like all really interesting and you kind
[06:44] of get nerd sniped by some of that
[06:47] stuff and it took me you know a year two
[06:50] years to come back to like oh this stuff
[06:52] is actually crap once you get deep
[06:54] enough into it um and there's legitimate
[06:56] Technologies I think that have emerged
[06:58] from it but the vast majority of the
[07:00] value is all going to flow from there
[07:02] being a monetary asset that's immutable
[07:04] and it took me a while to come back to
[07:06] that and once I got that and then I
[07:07] could understand through all the people
[07:10] that were saying otherwise that Bitcoin
[07:13] is the only asset that maintains those
[07:15] properties that's when I got a lot more
[07:17] interested and focused on bitcoin and
[07:19] then at that point in time Bitcoin had
[07:21] grown enough to where I was like okay
[07:24] this thing's not stopping um I don't
[07:27] really see any sort of reasonable risk
[07:29] case and the risks scenarios for Bitcoin
[07:31] I do see at this point that's the best
[07:35] risk I think you can be taking in the
[07:36] world right now and that's when I'm just
[07:39] like what am I doing working in this
[07:40] industry like Bitcoin solves all the
[07:41] problems I care about in the world and
[07:44] it's very infant and there's so many
[07:46] massive massive implications that are
[07:48] going to come from the growth of this
[07:49] asset over time and this thing's going
[07:51] to change the world so let's get
[07:54] involved in it and at that point in time
[07:56] I quit my job um and and I just wanted
[08:00] to get as deep as I possibly could so I
[08:04] spent like nine months researching into
[08:06] everything that I was interested in I
[08:07] got a lot deeper into Bitcoin I taught
[08:09] myself how to code python so that I
[08:11] could do Jimmy song's programming
[08:12] Bitcoin book um and then after I got to
[08:17] that level I I'd read a bunch of other
[08:19] books not like standard Bitcoin books
[08:21] but um there there was a book written by
[08:24] some Princeton professors that was more
[08:26] of like a textbook around the history of
[08:28] Bitcoin
[08:30] cryptocurrency and um and cryptography
[08:33] and like that was super helpful for my
[08:35] understanding um and mastering Bitcoin
[08:38] was a great book and then Jimmy song's
[08:40] book um and a few others and then a
[08:43] bunch of other different aspects of like
[08:45] banking history I wanted to look into
[08:47] and through that process I was like okay
[08:49] I should probably be writing some of
[08:50] this stuff out so that I can understand
[08:51] it for myself better and I ended up
[08:53] writing so much that I was just like
[08:55] okay I could I guess I could turn this
[08:57] thing into a book at this point
[09:00] and um and yeah and then I just kind of
[09:02] decided like yeah let's write a book so
[09:04] I turned it into a book and
[09:07] then that book ended up doing a lot
[09:09] better than I ever would have expected I
[09:10] self-published it and then the Bitcoin
[09:12] Community really liked it they started
[09:14] promoting it on Twitter pretty heavily
[09:16] that led to podcast appearances Etc and
[09:20] um and yeah so it kind of filled this
[09:22] void when I was writing the book where
[09:25] Bitcoin standard is more economics
[09:27] focused um I wanted to a lot more
[09:29] holistic and write a book that's going
[09:31] to get like a hedge fund manager to
[09:33] understand Bitcoin at more of a
[09:35] technical level um and that was kind of
[09:39] where my book fit into the niches I was
[09:41] a bit more pragmatic I wasn't as
[09:43] ideological I tried to like Source
[09:45] information from like the Federal
[09:46] Reserve directly where I could things
[09:48] kind of like that so that I wasn't just
[09:50] like here's what Austrian economists
[09:52] think and that's what I think um and um
[09:56] and I wanted to be a lot more technical
[09:57] in my explanation of Bitcoin not
[09:59] everything like you go read a developer
[10:01] book on bitcoin and they're going to
[10:03] teach you all these other aspects that
[10:05] aren't necessarily relevant to getting
[10:06] its Investment Properties or savings
[10:09] properties uh it's relevant for
[10:12] pragmatic use of it but that's not the
[10:14] point of my book my point is to say like
[10:16] here's why Bitcoin can't be stopped and
[10:18] here's why it's going to be the most
[10:19] valuable asset in the world and um and
[10:22] that means you have to understand the
[10:23] incentives of the network so when it
[10:25] comes to how the network operates and
[10:28] how it's secure and how the incentives
[10:30] of it are unlined that's where I wanted
[10:31] to go a lot more in depth and that was
[10:33] one of the areas that my book got a lot
[10:35] of success for was explaining like
[10:36] here's how cryptography actually works
[10:38] here's how your Bitcoin can't get hacked
[10:41] through the cryptography can get hacked
[10:43] on your computer just like anything else
[10:45] on your computer could get hacked um but
[10:48] and you know here's here's how like the
[10:50] actual mining process works and it got a
[10:52] bunch of attention for my explanation
[10:54] around that and uh you know there's a
[10:56] variety of other different things I went
[10:58] into and then I tie it all together with
[10:59] like here's all the major criticisms of
[11:02] Bitcoin and here's my response to
[11:03] everything like that in the Final
[11:04] Chapter um and yeah and that kind of got
[11:07] me started in the industry and then I
[11:10] spent a little bit of time thinking
[11:11] about building a business and what it
[11:14] eventually led me to is starting a
[11:15] venture capital fund which is similar to
[11:17] what the world I came from but rather
[11:19] than dealing with mature declining
[11:21] companies now we're dealing with very
[11:22] early growing companies and um and for a
[11:26] while I thought it was a bit premature
[11:27] to invest in companies around Bitcoin
[11:29] and it was around 2023 when I was like
[11:32] no I think we're starting to get to an
[11:33] inflection point and that's when I got
[11:36] to work on all this and uh we started
[11:38] the fund last year and we invest in
[11:41] startups that the way we think about it
[11:44] is we're investing in Bitcoin adoption
[11:46] um we think that bitcoin price is going
[11:48] to grow we also think it's adoption and
[11:50] other characteristics is going to grow
[11:52] so we try to invest in infrastructure
[11:54] and things like that around it that are
[11:55] going to grow it and U and we think
[11:57] that's going to be a very profitable
[11:58] business of the next
[12:00] decade and I also think it's solving the
[12:04] most important problem in Bitcoin like
[12:06] right now I think the case for you know
[12:08] Bitcoin isn't going to zero Bitcoin
[12:10] becoming digital gold I view is near
[12:13] certainty and um the question is is
[12:16] what's going to make it the first
[12:18] neutral monetary system of the world and
[12:21] that's what I'm most intrigued about in
[12:23] this industry and um and I think the
[12:26] infrastructure and architecture around
[12:28] it is what's going to bring it there and
[12:30] there's a lot that needs to be built
[12:32] whether that's natively around Bitcoin
[12:34] whether that's integrating it into
[12:35] current systems that are going to
[12:37] increase its adoption to get it to a
[12:39] scale to where its volatility is low
[12:40] enough to make it a better and better
[12:42] savings asset over time for the broader
[12:44] population and um and eventually just to
[12:48] be a permissionless neutral system that
[12:50] EV every type of user is opting into um
[12:54] so it's it's cool man I uh I think we're
[12:56] working on the coolest problem in the
[12:58] world and now we're and it's and it's a
[13:00] busy time and the stars are aligned with
[13:01] everything and I think that happens a
[13:03] lot in Bitcoin because because it's a
[13:05] valuable asset and one way or another
[13:08] people are going to want to support this
[13:09] type of an asset amazing yeah like that
[13:12] that's a that's an amazing uh story line
[13:15] of like how you came from traditional
[13:17] Finance to the Bitcoin and kind of went
[13:20] all in there um the book just for for
[13:23] people that want to maybe read it or
[13:25] something like that it's called the
[13:26] seventh property of Bitcoin is that the
[13:27] book you're referring to yeah yeah oh
[13:30] really cool how does the how did the
[13:32] name come to be I I uh disclaimer I did
[13:35] not read it but how did the name the
[13:38] seventh property of Bitcoin come to be
[13:39] and like why why that yeah so it's funny
[13:43] because you're like writing it the whole
[13:44] time out of the back of head I'm like oh
[13:45] I gotta think of a name for this and I'm
[13:47] you know writing this whole list and
[13:50] nothing you know a bunch of like e it's
[13:51] all right and I was like running it by
[13:53] my girlfriend at the time she's kind of
[13:54] like trying to be nice and she's like
[13:55] yeah it's not a very good name um but
[14:00] the first thing that clicked um I don't
[14:02] think I've ever said this on a podcast
[14:04] before but the first thing that clicked
[14:06] was when so I was going back into one of
[14:09] my chapters and like the fundamental
[14:11] thesis or like probably maybe not even
[14:13] the fundamental thesis but like the most
[14:15] novel idea out of my book is there's
[14:19] kind of six generally accepted
[14:21] fundamental properties that make money
[14:24] good money um and there's there's like
[14:27] degrees of semantics of where you can
[14:28] make that a lower number or a higher
[14:30] number and things like that but like
[14:31] generally speaking it's always been
[14:32] about six and the argument that I make
[14:34] in the first half of my book is that
[14:36] Bitcoin is it was able throughout
[14:40] history to take all these benefits that
[14:42] we got when we centralized
[14:44] infrastructure around money and it was
[14:47] actually able to improve upon that and
[14:50] still do it in a decentralized
[14:52] architecture and like that was the
[14:53] primary Innovation is we could keep
[14:54] everything decentralized without having
[14:56] to have these intermediaries who you
[14:59] know inter like the three ways that
[15:00] intermediaries really interact with
[15:02] money is through its production its
[15:04] storage and its
[15:06] verification and we found a way to do
[15:08] all of that in a decentralized manner so
[15:12] that gives it this proper property of
[15:14] being an immutable asset and that's
[15:17] novel and that's novel within money and
[15:21] the way that I pose this question is
[15:23] we've always fundamentally assessed
[15:24] money from six monetary properties now
[15:26] that Bitcoin has kind of created this
[15:27] new property should have seventh
[15:30] property considered within this equation
[15:31] of immutability and um and I was like oh
[15:36] the seventh property like that's kind of
[15:37] interesting and Seven's my lucky number
[15:39] and that was the big thing where I'm
[15:40] just like yeah okay that makes perfect
[15:42] sense it's my lucky number let's make
[15:43] that the title I love that yeah really
[15:46] cool thank you for sharing the story um
[15:48] it's super interesting that that you're
[15:50] doing it with Bitcoin businesses now um
[15:53] one really hard question maybe I don't
[15:55] know if if if you can answer that but
[15:57] I'm thinking about that a lot because I
[15:59] have so many Bitcoin businesses on on my
[16:01] show you are almost the 400th guest like
[16:03] I my 309 390th guest you now so I'm
[16:07] talking with a lot of Bitcoin businesses
[16:09] and people that are doing something in
[16:11] in the space I'm always trying to figure
[16:12] out okay H how does the Bitcoin business
[16:15] and the ecosystem will look like in 10
[16:17] 20 years and what are kind of the the
[16:20] the the most successful ones the most
[16:23] profitable ones if you compare it like
[16:26] to um what we had for the internet uh it
[16:29] was kind of hard to predict at the
[16:30] starting of like the tcpip protocol uh
[16:33] what will be the most successful one
[16:35] with like apple Facebook and Google on
[16:38] top of that what is kind of the those
[16:41] things for Bitcoin and is that even
[16:44] comparable to what the dcpa protocol did
[16:48] for the internet and then we have those
[16:51] companies on top of each other uh with
[16:53] Bitcoin as Bitcoin is kind of different
[16:56] kind of a
[16:57] thing yeah
[17:00] yeah that's a that's a good way of
[17:01] posing it um so I think there's there's
[17:05] two things going on here there is to
[17:09] your point analogously with the
[17:11] emergence of the internet there's new
[17:14] protocols that are emerging Bitcoin is
[17:17] the base protocol um you know pretty
[17:20] similar to
[17:22] tcpip and and then we have these other
[17:25] internet-based protocols that were built
[17:27] on top that also enabled us to create a
[17:30] more seamless experience uh to transfer
[17:33] data to create security um and and it
[17:37] wasn't really until these protocols were
[17:39] all established in a formidable way that
[17:42] the modern version of the internet
[17:44] started to proliferate on top of all of
[17:46] it
[17:48] um Bitcoin is similar in that bitcoin's
[17:50] this base protocol and we have these
[17:52] other protocols that are emerging and
[17:54] they're leveraging Bitcoin in some sort
[17:56] of way lightning network is a very
[17:58] common example it's just a separate
[18:00] protocol it could be used for any asset
[18:02] you could integrate it with you know a
[18:04] meme coin if you wanted to um people are
[18:08] using it for Bitcoin because it makes
[18:09] sense to have a protocol like that
[18:11] working with Bitcoin um there's other
[18:13] things like eash there's side chains
[18:16] there's now like ZK rollups which was
[18:19] something that kind of emerged in the
[18:20] ethereum world that are coming on top of
[18:22] Bitcoin um all these different Protocols
[18:25] are saying we can facilitate this
[18:28] specific function that people are going
[18:29] to need um there's a ton of debate about
[18:32] what the value is ultimately with those
[18:34] over the long term and it's definitely
[18:35] something I've written a good amount
[18:36] about and more of a technical subject
[18:38] but we have this emergence of a protocol
[18:40] stack that's happening in the same way
[18:42] the internet did and then we have
[18:43] businesses and businesses some exist
[18:47] today they don't need to leverage a
[18:48] bunch of that protocol stack a lot can
[18:51] just Exist by integrating with Bitcoin
[18:53] um L1 and um and that emergence is more
[18:58] comparable to when the era was emerging
[19:02] and we had this huge you know Cambrian
[19:05] explosion of all these different
[19:06] companies who all had these thesis of
[19:08] let's just build something now let's see
[19:10] what kind of works and um and there was
[19:12] a ton of froth and a bunch of things
[19:13] failed so like with these two Dynamics
[19:17] um they're both interdependent on each
[19:19] other right like I think the
[19:22] ultimate like hundred yearlong type
[19:25] business models that we're going to
[19:26] expect are probably going to come when
[19:29] we have a much better sense of what the
[19:34] long-term protocol stack is that
[19:36] everybody's using and uh and what types
[19:38] of applications are going to be
[19:40] leveraging that natively over time so
[19:42] today it's like what was Apple doing
[19:44] when a lot of that was happening like
[19:46] they were building Hardware um because
[19:50] these things were like demanded within
[19:51] the market similar today what are what
[19:53] are some of the most scaled business
[19:55] models people who want to get Bitcoin so
[19:57] exchanges and then people who are
[19:59] building Hardware Asic
[20:02] manufacturers and then people who are
[20:04] operating that Hardware mining companies
[20:07] um these are very large business models
[20:09] that kind of emerged at the right time
[20:11] with the market for what was being
[20:12] demanded within Bitcoin over time
[20:14] long-term applications and things like
[20:16] that we'll see but what's interesting is
[20:18] that because these businesses hit such a
[20:20] large scale from growing with it at the
[20:22] right time now they're in a better
[20:23] position in the coming years to actually
[20:26] build whether it's inous or to acquire
[20:28] other St startups um to continue
[20:31] expanding out into other applications
[20:33] that emerge once we have a more
[20:34] solidified protocol stack that people
[20:36] are building on top of um so that that
[20:40] that's kind of how I'm thinking about a
[20:42] lot of it but we have established
[20:44] business models I think that you know
[20:46] what we're looking at is a lot around
[20:49] financial services for Bitcoin today
[20:51] we're definitely investing in a lot of
[20:53] businesses where our view is that
[20:55] Bitcoin adoption is just good um gener
[20:58] generally speaking there's plenty of
[21:00] Doomsday scenarios we can walk through
[21:02] of how centralization can impact the
[21:05] network um and that's something we want
[21:07] to be mindful of but I I don't think
[21:09] like ETFs are a major concern for that
[21:11] I've written a thread on what I think
[21:14] could be something significant but as it
[21:17] exists today it's one something that's
[21:19] going to be too hard to control because
[21:20] it exists within a market and all you
[21:22] can really do is uh create alternative
[21:24] solutions that are competitive against
[21:26] these so that people don't want to buy
[21:28] ETFs um that's the best thing that you
[21:32] can
[21:33] do but ETFs are um an example of
[21:36] something where there could be a
[21:37] significant amount of centralization
[21:39] that comes from it but it's also
[21:40] drastically increasing the amount of
[21:42] adoption within the asset which
[21:43] drastically der risks its value
[21:46] proposition which drastically increases
[21:48] the amount of adoption of it over time
[21:50] so it's a question of like how do we
[21:51] weigh the net benefits and I think the
[21:54] question is most relevant if there's a
[21:55] way for us to actually control it which
[21:58] there's not so it's just like build
[21:59] competing products is the best thing
[22:01] that you can really do um but yeah
[22:05] there's a lot of interesting Financial
[22:06] Services applications where all we're
[22:08] focused on is Bitcoin is going to be
[22:11] used as a savings technology for a long
[22:13] time it's not going to be this neutral
[22:15] monetary system for a long time that's
[22:17] our long-term Vision that's what we want
[22:19] to create but we think where the market
[22:21] is today is people just are going to
[22:22] want to store in the most scarce IM
[22:24] mutable asset that exists and um in the
[22:27] next decade bit coin is going to Define
[22:29] portfolios for everybody and everybody's
[22:31] going to look at this and say if you had
[22:33] Bitcoin over the past decade then that's
[22:35] where all all the richest people in the
[22:37] world now are those people and um and
[22:40] then eventually we're going to hit this
[22:41] medium exchange explosion once that
[22:44] happens and I think Bitcoin needs to be
[22:46] a you know 20 to 50 trillion dollar
[22:48] asset before people really start
[22:50] leveraging it in that type of manner
[22:52] it's being leveraged at smaller scale
[22:54] around the world in plenty of situations
[22:56] because of its novel properties but I
[22:58] don't think we're going to see nearly
[22:59] the same scale of adoption happen for
[23:01] medium exchange of Bitcoin until the
[23:05] savings technology is you know kind of
[23:07] like matured within the market to a
[23:10] degree um yeah I'll stop there yeah
[23:13] there's uh there's a lot a lot already
[23:16] in there um Med of exchanges I had this
[23:19] discussion actually today earlier when I
[23:21] met with a Bitcoin colleague for coffee
[23:23] today in Vienna um where people are
[23:27] upset now what El salvad was doing uh
[23:29] with kind of backtracking the uh legal
[23:34] tender law for for Bitcoin in El
[23:36] Salvador but at the same time I was
[23:39] completely shocked that any that there
[23:42] is already a country that is considering
[23:45] that and doing that in 2021 so it's kind
[23:47] of they were really early do that game
[23:50] it's like they were like five 10 years
[23:53] maybe early to to doing that in the
[23:55] first place and now obviously they have
[23:57] leverage and used that against the IMF a
[24:00] little bit uh and I don't know it didn't
[24:04] seem to be such a bad uh back stop for
[24:07] the med of exchange side of things so
[24:10] that's also what you kind of saying
[24:11] where we still in the store of value
[24:13] phase and the media of exchange side of
[24:15] things is coming down the line once we
[24:18] really prove them to be bigger than gold
[24:20] or something like that yeah yeah yeah
[24:24] once it's like reasonable to actually
[24:26] start creating contracts structured
[24:28] denominated in Bitcoin um because the
[24:31] price volatility is low enough and you
[24:33] look at you look at all of the um charts
[24:36] and they support that the volatility of
[24:37] the assets declining and I don't think
[24:39] that that's any huge surprise might be a
[24:41] surprise to like Nasim TB um who was
[24:45] pointing to that as this primary
[24:46] argument for denouncing Bitcoin within a
[24:48] matter of like two years or something
[24:50] which was actually just like that that
[24:52] was one of the most absurd things in the
[24:53] world I couldn't believe any of that um
[24:56] but the volatility is declining um the
[24:59] biggest change that I think is most
[25:01] interesting too is as we watch and this
[25:03] is what I've been following for years
[25:05] and it's kind of the only I I don't do a
[25:06] ton of like macro stuff on bitcoin but
[25:10] the correlation of Bitcoin is an asset
[25:12] class across other asset classes like
[25:14] once I think we really start to see
[25:16] store value is when the massive
[25:19] decoupling of Bitcoin with
[25:22] primarily um risk assets within Equity
[25:25] markets once that starts to happen it's
[25:28] going to be something that it's going to
[25:30] be stupid for any sort of investor
[25:32] Financial professional not to have an
[25:33] allocation to it and um and and the math
[25:37] is starting to support us on that so now
[25:40] that that's coming into play um I think
[25:44] it could be a matter of years until like
[25:46] you know Bitcoin is just like with
[25:48] across like asset managers around the
[25:50] world Bitcoin is something that it you
[25:52] know people get the idea of you're more
[25:54] at risk not owning it than you are at
[25:56] owning it and just saying yeah like that
[25:59] that that's for sure how do you look uh
[26:02] at the current developments with uh now
[26:05] the biggest biggest kind of government
[26:08] that's possible with the United States
[26:09] looking at Bitcoin at a as a strategic
[26:12] Bitcoin Reserve that's for me that's the
[26:15] same as in 2021 with El Salvador it
[26:18] seems early especially
[26:21] because you because the US is kind of
[26:24] benefiting from the feed system the most
[26:27] uh where I'm okay they don't have the
[26:30] massive incentive maybe they have the
[26:31] incentive because they can lose the most
[26:34] uh if they don't get on a new system how
[26:36] do you look at uh the US dollar might
[26:40] Embrace or USA might Embrace Bitcoin
[26:43] yeah it's it's a good point because I
[26:44] was of the same framework of thinking
[26:47] um they have the most to lose
[26:50] potentially the most to gain it's kind
[26:51] of a game of chicken for them um I've
[26:55] been very surprised at everything that's
[26:58] happened within the US even um even
[27:01] prior to the Trump
[27:02] Administration um the regulatory
[27:06] developments in favor I mean prior to
[27:09] the Trump Administration like the courts
[27:10] were enacting orders in the US that was
[27:13] supportive of Bitcoin and U and that
[27:17] surprised me and then the amount of
[27:19] adoption that we witnessed over the past
[27:21] year completely blew my
[27:22] expectations um I always assumed that it
[27:26] would be a bottom up Sovereign level
[27:29] adoption from developing economies that
[27:32] are most removed from trade structures
[27:36] across the world like my view prior to
[27:40] everything that's happened last year was
[27:42] that we're going to have some sort of
[27:43] conservatorium of emerging market
[27:45] economies throughout the global South
[27:46] that are maintaining some sort of
[27:47] Reserve in the asset and starting to
[27:49] settle trade amongst one another within
[27:50] the next decade uh that's like going to
[27:53] be the first major Catalyst towards
[27:55] Sovereign adoption of the asset over
[27:56] time and then here we are
[27:58] um I in terms of the criticism about
[28:02] SBR um so I think there's it's a
[28:07] question of like how do you think about
[28:09] the Strategic Bitcoin reserves benefits
[28:12] and to who um I think from the
[28:14] bitcoiners perspective I view any sort
[28:17] of demand for Bitcoin is good um so it's
[28:22] good in that sense in terms of actual
[28:25] support by the country for the long-term
[28:29] benefit of the asset the only thing I
[28:32] care about is capital gains and what was
[28:35] really cool is what happened in the
[28:37] Czech Republic this morning with
[28:40] Parliament unanimously passing this law
[28:45] that's going to eliminate long-term
[28:47] capital gains tax on bitcoin so if you
[28:49] hold your Bitcoin for three years you're
[28:51] not going to pay tax on any capital
[28:53] appreciation on it and the Central Bank
[28:55] adopting it is a reserve asset like that
[28:57] that's massive
[28:59] um that is one of the most important
[29:02] things and them pushing the Domino on
[29:04] that El Salvador starting like you're
[29:05] saying a bit early on that
[29:08] um I like once we start to see this uh
[29:13] you know effectively like arms race for
[29:16] attracting Bitcoin to an economy across
[29:18] different governments um that's when
[29:21] it's like all bets are off if you
[29:23] eliminate capital gains from all this
[29:24] that's what enables the entire
[29:25] peer-to-peer system to function without
[29:27] the risk of violence being enacted upon
[29:29] you like as long as you know like once I
[29:31] own this asset I don't ow anybody's
[29:34] anymore and I can just completely
[29:35] operate by using this asset in a
[29:37] peer-to-peer manner um that's a complete
[29:39] GameChanger for how I think peer-to-peer
[29:41] is going to start to build out so like
[29:43] that's what I'm thinking is the most
[29:44] important thing it's like US government
[29:47] can start buying whatever they want I
[29:48] would actually prefer they don't buy it
[29:50] and they give that money back to
[29:51] taxpayers and then people can go buy it
[29:55] um I like the whole idea of a sovereign
[29:57] wealth fund I just think is stupid in
[29:58] the first place especially when we have
[30:00] $36 trillion in debt so like you know
[30:03] there's no point of us having a fund
[30:04] it's like let's give this money back to
[30:06] the people we took it from but um I
[30:09] think that none I all I care about is
[30:11] really more just like what policies are
[30:13] enabling individuals to use Bitcoin to
[30:15] its fullest potential from a regulatory
[30:17] standpoint I partnered up with coin
[30:21] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:23] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:26] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:29] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[30:32] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:35] subtle elent way to go out there and
[30:38] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:40] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[30:44] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:46] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:50] watch collections you have the date of
[30:52] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:55] there and of course also the block
[30:58] height and which Epoch we are currently
[31:01] in I love the level of detail they put
[31:04] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:06] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:09] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:12] love those watches so so much if you
[31:15] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:17] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:19] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:22] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:25] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:28] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[31:30] is the bit box it's super secure it's
[31:32] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[31:35] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin
[31:37] on an exchange and you can get a 5%
[31:41] discount with the code Robin at the
[31:43] checkout visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin
[31:47] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[31:50] to really level up your sovereignty as
[31:52] an individual you have to have the most
[31:55] secure self custody setup you have to
[31:57] secure your own devices you have to
[32:00] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:03] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:06] where you live you even want to have a
[32:08] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:11] in case something goes really really
[32:13] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:14] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:18] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:20] way.com
[32:21] Partners SL Robin you even get a 30
[32:25] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:27] level up your
[32:29] sovereignty yeah I like that a lot that
[32:32] point of view of like we we want uh uh
[32:36] people of the United States to own
[32:38] Bitcoin not the United States to own
[32:41] Bitcoin like we want to incre the
[32:43] increase the Crossroads Adoption of it
[32:46] uh which is also interesting because
[32:48] like if the United States actually goes
[32:51] ahead and buys let's say 200,000 300,000
[32:53] Bitcoins this in itself will trigger a
[32:56] lot of adoption and it will uh open up a
[33:00] lot of eyes and it will probably push
[33:02] adoption uh further down the line but at
[33:05] the same time we we do want the
[33:07] individual to own most of the Bitcoin
[33:09] not institutions but again like Bitcoin
[33:11] is for enemies so like we we don't get
[33:14] to choose who who who owns Bitcoin and
[33:16] who who doesn't and and it's good either
[33:19] ways for the ad option yeah yeah and I
[33:22] mean like I think people will make
[33:24] arguments like okay so if we go a little
[33:26] bit more in depth on the question
[33:28] the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is now
[33:30] going to align incentives of the
[33:32] government's balance sheet with uh the
[33:35] decision makers within it and that's
[33:37] going to further long-term benefit the
[33:39] industry and I think it's true I think
[33:41] it's a lot more complicated than that I
[33:43] don't think like politicians are really
[33:45] necessarily incentivized by the uh
[33:48] fiscal sustainability of our position I
[33:51] think they're incentivized by you know
[33:53] what sort of personal benefits they get
[33:55] from the political position that they're
[33:57] in
[33:58] and what happens after they get out of
[33:59] office so I don't think it's necessarily
[34:02] going to make them you know always be
[34:03] enacting Pro Bitcoin policies uh one of
[34:06] the primary criticisms of an spr of why
[34:09] they don't think it'll
[34:11] happen was that it's a similar argument
[34:15] to like what happened with um the Luna
[34:18] cryptocurrency that enabled it to start
[34:21] crashing was it you know the reflexive
[34:24] nature of it and circularity that
[34:27] ultimately let it to run up in price so
[34:28] drastically and then it was all backed
[34:31] by demand for the underlying token which
[34:34] had no fundamental monetary utility and
[34:36] then the second the founder decided to
[34:38] replace that token a proportion of that
[34:42] backing token with Bitcoin to say we're
[34:44] really going to short it up that signal
[34:46] to the market well then this Val
[34:49] collateral isn't as valuable as Bitcoin
[34:51] what makes it valuable and then that's
[34:53] when the entire run on that
[34:54] cryptocurrency happened and people are
[34:56] making a similar argument
[34:58] to what would happen with the us over
[35:02] time okay if we think that we need to
[35:04] have Bitcoin backing this unbacked fiat
[35:07] currency then that's going to Signal the
[35:09] market first n spr is not backing it
[35:12] it's just saying we have wealth on our
[35:14] balance sheet fiscally um I I I don't
[35:19] agree with that argument just because
[35:21] everybody knows this everybody knows
[35:23] that you know the US dollar doesn't gain
[35:26] its fiscal dominance
[35:28] because of some sort of
[35:30] um asset that's backing it the asset
[35:33] that's backing it is guns it's trade
[35:35] agreements it's contract denomination
[35:38] globally I mean fundamentally I think
[35:41] the number one thing that could change
[35:42] that would cause a death spral in the US
[35:44] dollar is if we lost our dominance of
[35:47] control over trade routes globally it's
[35:48] like a very geopolitical type argument
[35:51] for whether or not the dollar remains
[35:53] dominant like assume tomorrow our Fleet
[35:55] just disappears our Navy Fleet um now
[35:58] these countries that are using it to
[35:59] denominate trade are like okay well you
[36:02] guys guaranteed that you would protect
[36:04] our trade routes with your you know most
[36:07] powerful military in the world so we've
[36:09] been denominating our trade in it and
[36:11] that's why all our contracts are in this
[36:13] but now you're not doing that for us
[36:14] anymore why the hell are we trading in
[36:16] this thing and like that is I think you
[36:19] know what fundamentally is backing the
[36:21] dollar so if we were to like add Bitcoin
[36:23] to the balance sheet say that it signals
[36:25] something negative about the dollar it's
[36:27] just like I don't think anybody cares
[36:29] about that what matters is that we have
[36:30] the biggest guns and that we don't put
[36:33] our currency into some sort of
[36:34] inflationary death spiral um
[36:38] yeah it it's then also the the start of
[36:42] like if something like that happens
[36:44] where like big uh um Big countries big
[36:48] alliances in the world outside of the US
[36:50] are saying like oh we don't trust the us
[36:52] anymore which already is kind of
[36:54] happening um uh is that then this start
[36:57] of this game fear of like people like
[37:00] countries are trying to figure out what
[37:02] they can trust and then they're like oh
[37:04] there's only one thing in the world that
[37:06] uh you you can trust because you don't
[37:08] have to trust it and it's Bitcoin so
[37:10] that's kind of like the the way of um
[37:14] countries uh figuring out this whole
[37:17] Bitcoin thing where they like we have to
[37:20] denominate trade uh in Bitcoin but
[37:23] that's probably the end stage of the
[37:25] Bitcoin adoption not coming soon because
[37:28] now it's it's like too early for that I
[37:30] guess so I wrote a a long form paper on
[37:34] this a few years ago when
[37:37] um this was when the Biden
[37:40] Administration issued sanctions on the
[37:42] Swift Network to Russia and then that
[37:45] was bringing about all these
[37:46] geopolitical questions from Financial
[37:48] analysts around the world um and then
[37:50] everybody is talking about the
[37:51] implications for Bitcoin and similar
[37:53] arguments of well all these other
[37:55] countries have this um are between a
[37:58] hard place in a rock between you know
[38:01] accepting dollar hegemonia across the
[38:03] world or um you know using some sort of
[38:06] other alternative system there's been
[38:08] doomsday Sayers saying that the Chinese
[38:10] yuan is going to take over global
[38:12] dominance for decades now um and uh and
[38:16] the question is like well why isn't any
[38:17] of this stuff happening it's like what
[38:19] what is happening we're seeing a gradual
[38:21] decline in dollar dominance across
[38:23] certain measurements um particularly
[38:26] when it comes to certain trade volumes
[38:28] and contract denomination um Capital
[38:30] Market denomination uh we're seeing a
[38:32] gradual decline and it and it has been
[38:35] pretty significant in the recent decade
[38:38] across certain metrics
[38:40] um I think it was uh what what we had a
[38:43] decline in um US dollar denominated debt
[38:48] ownership from uh I want to say it was
[38:52] closer to like 69% back in like 2011 and
[38:55] now that number is closer to like 58% %
[38:58] and like that that's material it's a big
[39:00] shift and and if you look at well what
[39:03] is that shift going
[39:05] into the argument that it's a Chinese
[39:08] yuan is you know Chinese Yuan picked up
[39:11] a few percent of that total you know
[39:13] about 10% change and the rest of it's
[39:16] kind of just like a bunch of more
[39:18] Emerging Market type economies that are
[39:20] operating more independently so then
[39:21] that's your argument for well we're
[39:23] shifting into this more fragmented world
[39:26] of currency and that dominance is just
[39:28] going to decline for most people we're
[39:30] not going to have any sort of like you
[39:31] know true dominant currency of the world
[39:33] at some point
[39:35] um so then it that's like okay well if
[39:39] people are thinking like that and then
[39:41] the other big shift that we're starting
[39:42] to see as well is from Fiat denominated
[39:44] debt is a reserve asset to more
[39:48] commodity based assets is a reserve and
[39:53] so those two variables smaller economies
[39:55] are picking up slack dominance is dein
[39:57] in general and commodity based assets
[40:01] are starting to get more share within
[40:03] Sovereign wealth than um you know Fiat
[40:07] denominated debt so then that starts to
[40:08] make a really strong case for Bitcoin
[40:11] and and I think that when you think
[40:13] about the question fundamentally it's
[40:15] just like okay well emerging market
[40:17] economies who have the least to lose
[40:19] would be much more open to bitcoin um
[40:22] they don't have any sort of dominant
[40:24] fiat currency from which they extract
[40:26] significant political benefit it so
[40:28] they're just going to be using something
[40:30] that's more neutral it makes a lot more
[40:31] sense for them to do that and um and
[40:34] then Bitcoin functions like a synthetic
[40:36] commodity effectively so it has a lot of
[40:39] the properties that Sovereign um uh
[40:43] entities are looking for when they're
[40:44] trying to own their wealth and some more
[40:46] because its storage costs are so low
[40:48] it's very simple to own massive amounts
[40:49] of wealth in it and it's permissionless
[40:52] um you don't have to move it over the
[40:53] Swift Network you don't have to
[40:54] physically deliver it like gold bars and
[40:56] have those VAR ify it you know it's it's
[40:58] actually just like kind of like an ideal
[41:00] optimal way of storing wealth who' have
[41:03] thought and then when when you think
[41:05] about all those variables it's like okay
[41:07] so there's this really strong case for
[41:08] Bitcoin I think it's really easy to get
[41:10] excited I think though what is
[41:13] overlooked are the two primary variables
[41:16] and the reason when you would own this
[41:18] like kind of crappy US denominated debt
[41:22] that's not giving you great return at
[41:25] all um and is something where the fiscal
[41:31] um situation that's backing it is
[41:33] getting increasingly worse over time one
[41:36] of the primary variables if not the
[41:38] primary variable if you're like a
[41:40] sovereign institution where you want to
[41:42] have exposure of your assets is that you
[41:45] need to have very large deep liquid
[41:48] Capital markets that that asset can be
[41:51] participating in if I'm Saudi Arabia and
[41:55] I want to go liquidate $200 billion of
[41:57] an asset tomorrow then what markets can
[42:00] I do that in without significantly
[42:02] crashing the market you know and it's
[42:05] like us treasuries is your biggest right
[42:09] and then of Commodities gold is the
[42:11] biggest so that's what makes gold
[42:14] incredibly valuable to this day is it
[42:16] has a very um liquid Market that doesn't
[42:19] mean that transaction cost of physical
[42:21] delivery aren't High it just means that
[42:23] there's a lot of liquidity so that if
[42:25] you were to go sell a billion dollars
[42:26] worth of gold you're not going to move
[42:28] that market too much um Bitcoin doesn't
[42:31] have that yet we're two trillion dollar
[42:33] asset you know we're playing with the
[42:34] big boys but we aren't near the top of
[42:36] the pecking order in that world yet and
[42:39] once we get towards the top of the
[42:40] pecking order that's when Bitcoin takes
[42:43] over Sovereign wealth assets but it's
[42:45] going to take a long time for us to
[42:46] ultimately get there because we have all
[42:48] the other fundamental properties and I
[42:50] think the world is Shifting in a lot of
[42:51] Trends towards we want a neutral system
[42:53] we want to have commodity like assets
[42:55] backing this I just need something
[42:58] that's going to be incredibly deeply
[42:59] liquid so I can have a high exposure of
[43:01] my wealth in it and know that I can
[43:02] liquidate that quickly and ideally it
[43:05] eventually just becomes money you don't
[43:06] have to liquidate it in the first place
[43:08] but it's going to be a long time to get
[43:10] to all of that and I think like that's
[43:11] kind of the case for um how all these
[43:15] shifts in monetary dominance happening
[43:17] at a global level and uh and how Bitcoin
[43:19] can get involved in that do you see then
[43:22] uh the move
[43:24] towards Bitcoin only like the the theory
[43:27] of we only have one monetary Network The
[43:30] Singularity of the whole world is kind
[43:32] of around uh across like just Bitcoin at
[43:35] some point obviously is quite a quite a
[43:38] years away uh but is that happening at
[43:41] some point there's like in Bitcoin is
[43:43] old age debate of like will there always
[43:45] be feat currencies or will Bitcoin kind
[43:48] of take over because of Game Theory and
[43:50] there won't be anything else that is
[43:54] that is seriously be called money I mean
[43:56] obviously people will use other things
[43:59] maybe as money as like there's always SP
[44:01] going on the whole world is really
[44:02] complex but like there's one uh dominant
[44:06] monetary Network that kind of controls
[44:08] like 95% of the whole monetary value yep
[44:13] yeah so I I I think that's first like
[44:15] the good caveat of saying like because
[44:18] like in principle I don't believe like
[44:19] there's ever some form of like true 100%
[44:21] 99% dominance like there's going to be
[44:23] you know Edge case scenarios blah blah
[44:25] blah um
[44:28] so will Bitcoin become some sort of
[44:31] global direct form of money versus being
[44:36] an asset that backs some sort of
[44:38] sovereign currency maybe in a very very
[44:41] significant way maybe everybody's on a
[44:43] Bitcoin standard and that goes back to
[44:45] you know pre-or War I or during World
[44:48] War I or post World War I era and we're
[44:51] around like 30 to 40% 50% type gold
[44:55] standard packings maybe it's like we
[44:57] have a world like that is that kind of
[44:58] the question you're getting
[44:59] at yeah that's that's kind of the
[45:01] question I'm getting if it's if it's the
[45:04] if it's the wano is it the the backing
[45:06] one yeah
[45:08] yeah so I I've written a lot about this
[45:13] um I wrote a paper called Banks without
[45:15] bankers and before that I wrote a paper
[45:18] comparing um a Bitcoin standard type
[45:22] full Reserve System which is what we're
[45:25] describing is like the you
[45:28] know basically Global neutral type
[45:30] system and then uh comparing that to if
[45:33] we're going to have some sort of like
[45:34] fractional Reserve type system which is
[45:37] more Bitcoins is the backing commodity
[45:39] asset I wrote a very in-depth
[45:42] theoretical economic paper on that a few
[45:44] years ago um trying to just make the
[45:47] arguments for um at more of like a
[45:49] theoretical level what that looks like
[45:50] and then I wrote this paper bank without
[45:52] Bankers to say like here's what the
[45:53] technology stack on bitcoin could look
[45:56] like if it starts to build out a
[45:58] financial system around it
[46:00] um so I think the question is is
[46:05] like will and and it starts with
[46:08] understanding like how did how did paper
[46:12] money emerge in the first place and it
[46:15] emerged privately it emerged naturally
[46:18] in banking markets because once we had
[46:21] the printing press and invented Double
[46:24] Entry bookkeeping accounting and and
[46:27] eventually had the telegraph we were
[46:29] able to move money so much more
[46:31] efficiently than settling gold coins
[46:34] amongst one another and and paper added
[46:37] all these monetary properties to money
[46:40] it made it much more portable it made it
[46:43] much more
[46:44] divisible um it made it potentially more
[46:48] fungible it lowered the cost of
[46:50] verification and uh and that was all
[46:53] very good and that's why the market
[46:54] naturally converged upon paper the is
[46:57] that paper wasn't scarce so it needed to
[46:59] be backed by something that was and that
[47:02] was kind of the Inception of like
[47:03] backing a paper currency um when people
[47:06] are talking about what backs money today
[47:09] the Inception was we have a great money
[47:11] called paper for all these different
[47:13] reasons because it fits with the
[47:14] technology of our time very well but it
[47:17] isn't scarce and it needs to be backed
[47:19] by something that is and gold type
[47:21] standards emerge privately um in the
[47:24] west the the Inception of this at least
[47:27] with what the US kind of um built its
[47:31] banking system around was in England
[47:33] under the Goldsmith Bankers when they
[47:35] emerged privately and U there's a ton of
[47:37] cool history around all of that but why
[47:40] did governments get involved governments
[47:43] get involved um for the reason they
[47:45] always do they want they want to help
[47:47] people from the problems in the private
[47:49] markets and then they end up doing the
[47:50] exact same things themselves so there
[47:53] were there were problems
[47:55] um that were existing within the system
[47:58] like any private market system and uh
[48:00] and the government said we're going to
[48:02] fix these problems and they came in and
[48:05] took control and then did the exact same
[48:08] moral hazard that existed in the private
[48:10] system themselves what do they do they
[48:12] expanded the money supply too much they
[48:13] used it to try to create Fiat systems so
[48:15] that they could have their cake and eat
[48:17] it too and that's created boom and bus
[48:18] cycles of central banks throughout
[48:20] Europe throughout the us through the
[48:21] past few centuries um we did have other
[48:25] private banking system
[48:27] that had emerged and the government
[48:29] didn't get as involved um the Scottish
[48:33] Free banking system the term for that's
[48:34] free banking um in Canada there was a
[48:38] reasonably successful system for a
[48:39] period of time this was all kind of like
[48:41] um 18th 19th
[48:44] century and um and then in the US we use
[48:47] like the pre um First Central Bank era
[48:52] of Wildcat banking is a good example um
[48:56] and
[48:57] that's not a great example because the
[48:58] government was so involved in it that it
[49:00] kind of it screwed up a lot of the free
[49:01] market incentives that would make a
[49:03] system like that function um but
[49:06] nonetheless paper money emerged
[49:08] naturally in a private market so the
[49:10] idea that we're not going to have a
[49:12] similar like digital and and an
[49:17] um a similar system emerg digitally on
[49:20] top of Bitcoin you know the burden of
[49:22] proof is on us to say why we're not
[49:24] going to follow the pattern of history
[49:26] with that happening
[49:27] and and then the question becomes well
[49:30] what technologies of the time would
[49:31] change that what is going to make us not
[49:33] have receipts on bitcoin something like
[49:36] the lightning network is a great example
[49:38] of how we can have a guarantee on a
[49:41] fully backed Bitcoin through
[49:44] transactions using novel Technologies
[49:47] and and there's other technologies that
[49:48] are attempting to provide similar
[49:50] guarantees right now this ties back to
[49:52] the beginning of what's the protocol
[49:54] stack on bitcoin going to be um
[49:57] um these types of technologies that give
[50:01] assurances um that could be used by
[50:03] financial institutions like banks that
[50:05] we've never had before uh exist and
[50:09] there's more coming the problem with all
[50:12] of these things is doesn't really matter
[50:15] if we can create things that give us
[50:18] these types of guarantees all that
[50:20] matters is what does the market want and
[50:23] Will the Market ultimately demand these
[50:26] types of things
[50:27] if it was simple enough for me to run a
[50:29] lightning node is to download an
[50:32] application on my phone it would
[50:34] probably be really easy for everybody to
[50:36] have something like you know
[50:37] peer-to-peer direct payments that are
[50:40] hyper efficient and you can you know
[50:42] guaranteed to be backed by Bitcoin on
[50:45] the um base layer but it's not that
[50:48] simple there's economic costs and it's
[50:50] actually a lot more complex so we're
[50:53] starting to see institutions that manage
[50:54] lightning noes on behalf of people and
[50:56] there's some trust involved in that
[50:58] process um and and it's kind of like we
[51:02] have a protocol stack
[51:05] emerging but it's providing similar
[51:07] functions to what a banking institution
[51:09] would do for Bitcoin and the nature of
[51:12] banks is probably going to change very
[51:14] significantly but I don't think we've
[51:16] completely
[51:17] disintermediated the financial system so
[51:20] then that means if we haven't completely
[51:22] disintermediated it then we have a
[51:24] similar phenomenon emerging on top of
[51:26] Bitcoin where private Market Banks or
[51:29] you know Financial
[51:31] intermediaries are starting to emerge
[51:34] and to what degree will the government
[51:36] be able to get involved in all that um
[51:40] and it remains to be seen and I think I
[51:43] make an argument in this paper Banks
[51:45] without
[51:45] Bankers that I think what's different
[51:48] this
[51:49] time is we're going to have a system
[51:52] that's so efficient with so much
[51:54] information transparency that can use
[51:56] software and cryptography in novel waves
[51:59] to where it's really just going to be
[52:02] impossible for Regulators to ultimately
[52:06] um insert themselves too much in it
[52:09] that's that's the utopian Vision but I
[52:11] think that I think it's I think it's a
[52:13] reality um I think it's something that
[52:15] could that could definitely happen if we
[52:17] can build things that are competitive in
[52:18] a market at a cost level to where
[52:20] consumers want to use something like
[52:21] that um but nonetheless I think that
[52:24] even with you know even significant
[52:26] degrees of financial intermediaries that
[52:28] are used to enable us to all operate on
[52:31] a Bitcoin standard um as long as the
[52:34] market is competitive at a very high
[52:37] level that will solve a lot of these
[52:40] trust issues that people will have with
[52:42] intermediaries being involved in the
[52:44] money hypercompetitive markets are one
[52:47] of the greatest things in the world for
[52:48] people they they build things that we
[52:51] just never would have thought possible
[52:52] and serve consumers incredibly well so
[52:55] the questions to me what I'm most
[52:57] concerned about is how competitive and
[52:59] fragmented can this Market ultimately
[53:00] become over time and in the key variable
[53:03] that I look at to say if we're looking
[53:07] at new technologies emerging within the
[53:09] Bitcoin protocol stack or with companies
[53:11] or applications or things like that is
[53:14] any sort of new protocol that emerges
[53:16] what's the marginal cost for somebody to
[53:19] participate in that protocol like that's
[53:21] the fundamental thing that's what made
[53:24] that's what made Bitcoin decentralized
[53:26] and that's what's going to keep Bitcoin
[53:28] decentralized is that the cost to
[53:31] participate in the Bitcoin network if
[53:33] you were to compare this to any other
[53:35] cryptocurrency is drastically lower if
[53:38] you want to go get into if you want to
[53:40] set up a full node the amount of
[53:42] gigabytes in Hardware whatever it's out
[53:44] like 400 something right now to download
[53:47] the full blockchain and um and the cost
[53:50] associated with the hardware to actually
[53:51] do that is drastically lower than any
[53:54] other comparison like the next biggest
[53:55] competitor in terms of market cap of
[53:57] ethereum where it's you know over
[54:00] $10,000 I think to actually be like a
[54:02] validator within this network and then
[54:03] you have to have a significant amount of
[54:04] ethereum to stake within it Etc um it's
[54:07] too complex for anybody to actually set
[54:08] up themselves you could do you can
[54:10] participate in a full node in the
[54:11] Bitcoin network from your home computer
[54:13] so like that marginal cost of
[54:15] participation for people keeps things
[54:17] very competitive um and from the
[54:20] protocols that are emerging on
[54:22] bitcoin I view that if the marginal cost
[54:26] is low enough that these could also be
[54:29] very competitive markets so then
[54:31] question is like well what is a
[54:33] competitive market um and if we were to
[54:36] compare the historical nature of private
[54:39] banking systems that actually like free
[54:41] banks that actually functioned
[54:43] reasonably well for
[54:45] consumers this system that's emerging is
[54:47] going to be drastically more competitive
[54:50] because it's going to be a lot lower for
[54:52] the barriers to entry because the costs
[54:54] are going to be a lot lower to
[54:55] participate um it's going to be much
[54:57] more permissionless to participate it's
[54:59] going to be a lot harder for governments
[55:00] to control that access because you can
[55:02] access it through the internet you don't
[55:03] need to go like build a shop and like
[55:06] get contracts to set your bank up um and
[55:10] then there's all these things to where
[55:11] it's just going to be so much harder to
[55:13] control it it's going to be so much
[55:14] easier for people to get involved and
[55:17] that's and it's going to be so much more
[55:18] automated through software and there's
[55:21] going to be so much more information
[55:22] transparency that'll exist and all of
[55:25] those variables are fun function that
[55:26] make this Market I think we're going to
[55:28] have a market that's so much more
[55:29] competitive than we've ever seen so to
[55:33] tie it back to the original question
[55:34] like with all that context
[55:38] um will we we be able to see something
[55:41] where it's a commodity backing a
[55:44] government currency or will it be a
[55:47] globally neutral type system so like
[55:49] let's assume that what I just described
[55:51] is true we have this hyper competitive
[55:53] market of service providers around it um
[55:57] why would we care about having a
[55:58] government currency involved in any of
[56:01] that what what value do they really add
[56:03] to it um and how governments would get
[56:07] involved before is if there's
[56:09] significant degrees of fraud there's you
[56:12] know significant amounts of money that's
[56:14] being lost within the system and they
[56:16] can coales voters around um choosing to
[56:21] get them more involved and then that is
[56:24] the beginning of the process towards an
[56:25] eventual
[56:26] system um so if we have this emerging
[56:29] native system and it's functioning well
[56:32] for consumers because it's drastically
[56:34] more competitive than anything we've
[56:35] ever seen um and people can always and
[56:38] this is the primary variable that's
[56:40] never existed you can actually
[56:42] participate in a peer-to-peer
[56:45] economy yourself if you want to do the
[56:47] work you don't have to use
[56:48] intermediaries if you don't want to and
[56:51] because that possibility exists in this
[56:54] system that means that all of these
[56:56] other Financial intermediaries don't
[56:58] just have to compete with each other
[56:59] they have to compete with that
[57:01] substitute economy as well and we've
[57:03] never had banking systems where it's
[57:05] been like all right like pull your money
[57:06] out of the bank and you know unless
[57:08] you're like a drug cartel it's it's very
[57:11] challenging to just go operate
[57:12] everything in a cash economy in the
[57:14] market today it's just not even like a
[57:15] possibility for you to function with
[57:17] your life like that and and that will be
[57:19] a possibility within the system so
[57:22] that's this whole new competitive
[57:24] Dynamic and if a government's trying to
[57:27] insert themselves within that process I
[57:28] think they're going to have a much
[57:29] harder time getting voters to actually
[57:32] agree with them on that because there's
[57:33] not going to be a big enough problem for
[57:35] them to solve and I think if that's the
[57:38] case having governments being a part of
[57:41] that currency is going to be something
[57:43] that just doesn't make sense within the
[57:44] market and I think like that's the case
[57:46] for how a global neutral system emerges
[57:49] I think in the near term though uh I
[57:53] think we're going to see plenty of
[57:54] governments backing their currency with
[57:56] Bitcoin and like that's great I think
[57:58] it's it's demand it's emerging
[58:00] everywhere um and and I think that
[58:02] that'll become very significant but I
[58:04] think over the long term there's a very
[58:06] strong case to be made that um we'll end
[58:09] up in a Bitcoin denominated Global
[58:11] neutral system that emerged from private
[58:13] markets that was amazing I
[58:16] L I L how you how you put it and and the
[58:21] uh kind of way of thinking about the
[58:24] competitiveness of the market and
[58:26] especially of like what value
[58:28] governments can add and they can add a
[58:29] lot of value with with gold uh and they
[58:32] cannot add a lot of value when the uh
[58:36] asset and the network is completely open
[58:38] permissionless and transparent uh to the
[58:42] point where you can uh have not as much
[58:45] fraud in in it uh than you would
[58:47] actually have maybe in other markets
[58:49] that's a really interesting interesting
[58:51] point um I want to talk because we we're
[58:55] already at like 1 hour
[58:56] before we kind of close it I want to
[58:58] talk do the way do to get there uh
[59:03] people talk a lot about different growth
[59:05] rates there are a lot of different price
[59:07] models and price models for me is like
[59:09] translation of like how do you see the
[59:11] growth happening for bitcoin price is
[59:13] and just a consequence of that um you
[59:16] said before that you expect volatility
[59:18] to continue to go
[59:20] down uh and there are two different uh I
[59:25] have two different kind of guests on the
[59:27] the one says like yeah we we kind of
[59:29] follow a diminishing returns kind of a
[59:31] strategy uh like power law like the
[59:34] Sailor model or like that many different
[59:36] models around that uh and the other one
[59:38] is like no like we we will hit that S
[59:40] curve adoption and the peak of
[59:43] volatility at the peak of like the the
[59:45] Steep curve of the uh growth rate of the
[59:49] growth curve is kind of still in front
[59:51] of us we in the early uh phases of that
[59:55] how do you see if Bitcoin is successful
[59:57] if we get there to the point that you
[60:00] just described how do you see the the
[60:03] the growth of that technology is it more
[60:05] of like an S curve adoption uh where
[60:08] maybe volatility in the medium term
[60:10] actually goes up because we hit a steep
[60:12] uh adoption curve uh or is it that slow
[60:15] organic slow in quot because Bitcoin is
[60:19] quite quite fast anyways but a slower
[60:22] organic growth where we slowly slowly uh
[60:24] grow but the growth uh uh rate is
[60:27] actually slowing down a little
[60:28] bit yeah
[60:31] um so for is like our founding
[60:35] investment philosophy document for my
[60:36] company um we wrote this paper that I
[60:39] called Bitcoin marginalism to kind of
[60:41] Define how we think about it in contrast
[60:44] to like you know the bit Bitcoin
[60:45] maximalist Viewpoint um and the way that
[60:49] we're viewing adoption Cycles is there's
[60:52] going to be three
[60:53] s-curves um store value medium exchange
[60:56] unit of account I don't think we've hit
[60:59] the inflection point and store value I
[61:00] think we're getting really close right
[61:02] now um
[61:04] and it's going to be the longest tail
[61:07] and then I think it's going to happen
[61:08] much more rapidly after that and these
[61:10] going to be a little bit more quick and
[61:11] they're going to be um a little bit
[61:12] shorter to the diminishing returns Point
[61:14] volatility is going to be spiking for
[61:16] significant periods over time like when
[61:19] I'm talking about volatility declining
[61:20] it's like you know we've got over 15
[61:22] years of data to work with at this point
[61:23] and we do see a line of best fit that's
[61:25] going this direction um so that's good I
[61:29] think we're going to have spikes in the
[61:30] S curve volatility is going to go up
[61:32] massively the fundamental drivers behind
[61:35] what I think is going to make the line
[61:37] of best fit continue to go down over
[61:39] time is that um we are getting a deeper
[61:43] more liquid Capital Market around
[61:45] Bitcoin at a global level um credit
[61:47] markets are maturing that's one of the
[61:50] biggest things that's going to change
[61:51] this year in the US Sab 121 being
[61:54] repealed banks are going to start
[61:56] adopting Bitcoin um the amount of
[61:59] lending that's going to happen on top of
[62:01] Bitcoin as a collateralized asset is
[62:03] going to expand massively and it's going
[62:05] to be from actors that are a bit more
[62:06] regulated a bit more sophisticated
[62:08] they've been doing this type of business
[62:09] for a long period of time and that's
[62:12] going to change how sophisticated credit
[62:14] markets are it's not going to be I think
[62:16] to the same degree of blockfi and
[62:19] Celsius and FTX of we don't even know if
[62:23] we have the Bitcoin in account and we're
[62:24] going to re hypothecate all of it and
[62:26] we're going to build a billion dollar
[62:27] business and oh crap it disappear
[62:29] tomorrow like I don't think we're going
[62:30] to be seeing that degree of Fraud and
[62:33] risk taking as much anymore of course
[62:35] these things will always still occur but
[62:37] it's going to make people feel more
[62:39] secure and participating in this economy
[62:41] and the lending is going to be um much
[62:44] less Boomer
[62:45] bust um the biggest thing that I think
[62:48] we're releasing an annual report um
[62:51] through my firm so if you follow me on
[62:53] Twitter you'll find that I think one of
[62:55] the biggest things that we see is like
[62:57] what's going to cause the next boom and
[62:58] bust within Bitcoin or is this the last
[63:00] one um I think that the biggest thing is
[63:06] Bitcoin Corporate Finance strategies are
[63:08] going to grow massively over the next
[63:10] year and there's going to be a ton of
[63:12] Risk Takers that start to emerge within
[63:14] all that
[63:16] um there's going to be a bunch of cowboy
[63:18] CFOs who all want to get a St pop in
[63:20] their stock price and they're going to
[63:22] dot Bitcoin on their balance sheet and
[63:23] they're going to go take out a loan to
[63:25] do it they're going to accept cheaper
[63:26] and cheaper terms um and eventually
[63:29] there's going to be a bunch of guys who
[63:30] are overleveraged to get Bitcoin on
[63:32] their balance sheet and I think we're
[63:33] probably gonna have a bit of a boom and
[63:35] bust in that over the next
[63:36] year interesting yeah that's that's one
[63:39] more uh you describ of of like the the
[63:42] businesses one more aspect that I'm
[63:44] really curious also about we we see now
[63:47] the early signs of like big institutions
[63:50] adopting Bitcoin obviously the micro
[63:52] strategy Playbook is is is the one that
[63:54] are now companies also adopting SAR
[63:57] scientific I think I think SAR
[63:59] scientific was the first real uh company
[64:03] that that stepped into micro strategies
[64:05] Playbook then meta planet and other
[64:07] companies also followed funny enough uh
[64:09] the the last guest so like the previous
[64:11] guess to you was actually Eric simler
[64:13] from SIM scientific right before that um
[64:18] uh how how do you see
[64:20] long-term uh businesses
[64:23] impacted by Bitcoin if if they have now
[64:27] a savings vehicle where they don't have
[64:30] to uh do it with like like if you're
[64:33] invest in something you have to care for
[64:35] that like you have to look into the
[64:37] investment feces of that and so they
[64:40] have a cash balance and if that cash
[64:42] balance is Der roing you you have to do
[64:44] something with that what changes in a
[64:46] business once that cash balance is no
[64:50] longer eroding away and the cash balance
[64:52] is kind of Bitcoin uh what mic strategy
[64:55] did with Su scientific did what metap
[64:57] planet did so um what do you think will
[64:59] be the the longterm impact on businesses
[65:03] and on their investment decisions of uh
[65:07] them long term if they have a cash
[65:10] balance which is actually appreciating
[65:12] versus depreciating on the balance sheet
[65:15] it's going to it changes time preference
[65:18] um once businesses go through a cycle of
[65:21] realizing that the best return that
[65:24] we've given to our Equity hold ERS was
[65:26] from the Bitcoin sitting on our balance
[65:27] sheet all these other activities that
[65:29] we've been conducting on the side have
[65:31] not provided that much value that
[65:33] marketing guy we just hired we should
[65:35] have just put his salary into Bitcoin
[65:37] you know that back office admin that you
[65:40] know gave us a little bit extra time
[65:41] should have put that into Bitcoin um our
[65:44] CEO he didn't really make a lot of great
[65:46] decisions this year we should just put
[65:49] his salary into Bitcoin and everybody's
[65:51] going to be thinking from that type of
[65:53] perspective over time and
[65:56] and it's going to be great for Capital
[65:58] allocation I think a lot of businesses
[65:59] are going to end up looking in the
[66:01] mirror and they're just going to be like
[66:03] what are we doing that's actually
[66:05] valuable here and it's going to make
[66:06] them think much more long term and
[66:08] that's going to provide better cheaper
[66:11] goods and services to the economy and
[66:13] improve people's lives I love that uh
[66:16] it's basically the same thing that
[66:17] happens on an individual level once
[66:19] you're get on a Bitcoin standard you'll
[66:21] rethink things really cool we have one
[66:23] question that I asked each and every one
[66:24] of my guests and the question is what
[66:26] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin oh
[66:29] um like I said you know there there's a
[66:31] lot of like Financial topics and things
[66:33] that I'm pretty interested in um
[66:36] bitcoin's dominated my life at this
[66:38] point um yeah in terms of other things a
[66:42] lot of like entrepreneurship type stuff
[66:44] um I think I've learned a lot over the
[66:46] past five years since I've been on all
[66:47] this journey and uh it was long it's
[66:51] been arduous uh and and I think that
[66:55] despite things going better than I ever
[66:57] could have expected there's there's a
[67:00] lot of like personal things that
[67:03] um that I think are really cool that you
[67:05] learn by taking on a significant amount
[67:07] of risk and following your intuition um
[67:11] and I think that that changes your life
[67:12] pretty significantly um and it and it's
[67:15] led me to do all these other cool
[67:17] projects as well like our our office for
[67:18] my company um we're it's in a local
[67:22] nonprofit that I helped start out here
[67:23] in Denver and we're we're like a Bitcoin
[67:26] Citadel effectively and we just
[67:28] organized a group of guys nobody owns
[67:30] this thing um we all got together
[67:32] convinced other bunch of people to start
[67:34] supporting it and now we have this like
[67:36] really nice big building that we're
[67:37] having all of these like you know
[67:39] industry-leading events at and um and
[67:42] that's that's been super cool and
[67:44] rewarding and you know I don't make
[67:45] money from it um but learning how to
[67:49] just one of one of my favorite things is
[67:52] just starting things from nothing and um
[67:55] and and yeah I think that that's one
[67:58] thing I could communicate is uh go do
[68:01] that it's so much cooler than living
[68:03] somebody else's Vision I I totally agree
[68:06] with that I did the same exact thing not
[68:09] the same exact thing but doing exactly
[68:11] that uh last year and it paid off really
[68:14] really cool um we have an ENT in the
[68:17] podcast where a previous guest in that
[68:19] case Eric samler uh asked a question for
[68:22] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:24] next guest actually is uh and your
[68:26] question from the previous guest is what
[68:28] impact will Quantum Computing have on
[68:32] bitcoin yeah um I raise money from
[68:35] Financial investors and this topic comes
[68:38] from them all the time
[68:40] um all right here's my take so This
[68:44] concerns existed for a while it's not
[68:46] something that nobody's aware of that
[68:48] came out of nowhere I think a lot of
[68:49] people have that perception that it is
[68:52] um a member of the space which is this
[68:55] nonprofit out here in Denver is uh he
[68:58] goes by the pseudonym Hunter beast and
[69:02] he is like kind of one of the leading
[69:04] authorities on Quantum resistance
[69:06] cryptographic signatures within Bitcoin
[69:08] he wrote um I think it's I don't want to
[69:11] butcher it 360 or like 362 is his bip um
[69:16] but if you search Hunter and his um in
[69:20] Quantum resistance bip I think it'll pop
[69:22] up um but he uh
[69:27] so him and I have had a lot of
[69:28] conversations around all around all this
[69:30] and like basically the lay of the land
[69:32] is that
[69:33] Quantum uh Quantum attacks like the
[69:37] whatever it was like chth had this whole
[69:39] like fear-mongering thing around Quantum
[69:42] within Bitcoin this year you're not
[69:45] attacking Bitcoin you're attacking
[69:47] cryptography um cryptography is what
[69:50] secures a lot of diff is a technology
[69:52] that's used to secure a lot of different
[69:53] things within Bitcoin fact it's to
[69:55] secure a lot of different things
[69:57] everywhere on the internet and if we
[70:00] were to
[70:01] have Quantum cryptography broken uh if
[70:05] we were to have cryptography broken by
[70:07] quantum computers then that would
[70:11] undermine much of the systems that we
[70:13] use within technology today the funniest
[70:15] thing is how this this criticism is used
[70:17] in the media to is some sort of like
[70:21] knock against Bitcoin it's like why
[70:22] don't you ask about everybody's bank
[70:24] account because that's where all the
[70:26] money is right now and that's what they
[70:28] really should be concerned about if
[70:29] cryptography gets broken um but
[70:33] nonetheless we're GNA have a lot of big
[70:35] problems if this scenario were to happen
[70:38] and Bitcoin is probably not going to be
[70:39] the focal point of that if it were to
[70:41] happen within the next year
[70:43] um that
[70:45] said there is
[70:48] so it's one of those problems where
[70:51] people have been saying that it's coming
[70:53] soon for a long time and it's one of
[70:56] those things where maybe it happens
[70:58] within the next 5 years it could very
[71:00] easily happen within the next 10 10 to
[71:02] 15 years but we have plenty of time and
[71:05] then the question is well what happens
[71:06] to bitcoin there exists different types
[71:09] of cryptographic signatures which
[71:12] Bitcoin is a soft Fork away from
[71:15] including that are resistant to Quantum
[71:18] cryptography the question is is there's
[71:21] older ones that have a much stronger
[71:23] Lindy effect they've been around for a
[71:25] while they're more proven um we can get
[71:28] very comfortable with implementing them
[71:30] into a soft Fork those to the point I
[71:33] was making earlier about nodes having a
[71:36] low a low cost marginal cost
[71:38] participation by buying them you know
[71:40] not as much uh doesn't require a ton of
[71:43] memory to set one up about 500 gigabytes
[71:46] um if we started using Quantum
[71:49] resistance signatures then that could
[71:50] drastically expand the rate at which the
[71:54] um blow within the blockchain growth
[71:56] over time starts to happen and that's
[71:59] really the argument against why we would
[72:01] want to use one of these now there's
[72:02] other newer Quantum signature schemes
[72:06] that haven't been around as long and
[72:08] haven't been proven out yet that are
[72:10] much more data efficient to where that
[72:12] problem would be much less of a concern
[72:15] I think that within the time Horizon at
[72:16] which Quantum resistance is a risk we're
[72:19] probably going to get a lot more
[72:20] comfortable with using some of these
[72:22] more efficient Quantum resistance
[72:23] signature schemes and and um and because
[72:26] of that it's not really a massive
[72:29] concern to me interesting yeah um by the
[72:33] way I just quickly checked it out it's
[72:34] bip uh 360 from hunt to Beast he's also
[72:37] on on on Twitter I saw it it's his pin
[72:40] tweet if you search on Twitter Hunter
[72:42] Beast you find it and has been tweeted
[72:44] directly on there uh thank you so much
[72:46] that was was really cool um before I let
[72:49] you go uh where can people find you ask
[72:51] your questions especially find all those
[72:53] great articles that you mentioned your
[72:54] Twitter and everything like that yeah
[72:57] it's fun I actually don't even think I
[72:58] have my website link on my Twitter
[73:00] anymore um so some of the Articles were
[73:02] on my are on my blog it still exists
[73:05] it's yakes doio my last
[73:08] name. um some older papers I wrote If
[73:11] you go to my firm's website there's
[73:14] going to be some new releases around uh
[73:17] an annual report on the Bitcoin
[73:18] ecosystem coming out and um uh and then
[73:22] that Bitcoin marginalism paper with the
[73:24] scurve adoption op cycles that I was
[73:26] talking about earlier that's there and
[73:28] that's Epoch
[73:30] vc. so Epoch spelled like that EP vc. so
[73:35] basically uh on on your Twitter uh site
[73:39] there's yikes. linked and there yeah
[73:43] exactly there's both linked so like link
[73:45] is as always in the description so you
[73:47] can check it out uh if you're interested
[73:49] in that and uh then from there you can
[73:51] basically get in into everything else
[73:54] thank you so much Eric for being on on
[73:56] the show it was was a pleasure having
[73:58] you also thank you so much for everyone
[74:00] that is watching and listening for
[74:01] joining us today as always I'll be back
[74:04] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
[74:07] [Music]
