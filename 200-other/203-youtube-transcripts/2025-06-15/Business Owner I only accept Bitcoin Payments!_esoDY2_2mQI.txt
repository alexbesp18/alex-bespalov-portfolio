[00:00] we're trying to build the Bitcoin
[00:01] circular economy out and have more
[00:03] people around the world use Bitcoin only
[00:05] you actually go ahead and say no no our
[00:07] business is Bitcoin only we only accept
[00:10] Bitcoin no shitcoins and no Fiat
[00:13] currencies the advantages so far our
[00:15] chance the disadvantage just buy a long
[00:16] shot for us um I mean the the biggest
[00:19] one obviously being the the ease of
[00:21] doing business we don't have to succumb
[00:23] to as much regulation as when you when
[00:25] you have a fat bank account by accepting
[00:27] between ear we we don't have to operate
[00:29] in any specific jurisdiction as long as
[00:32] someone can access our website and
[00:33] they're able to passay us through the
[00:34] Bitcoin Network they can use our service
[00:36] we only pay people in Bitcoin as well
[00:38] and that helps because now we're forced
[00:40] to under use Bitcoin it basically which
[00:44] is awesome you can buy almost anything
[00:45] online using Bitcoin and obviously bid
[00:47] refill is also a huge here we have to
[00:48] get the Bitcoin circular economy as
[00:50] strong as possible as soon as possible
[00:52] most bitcoiners just haven't thought
[00:53] that far ahead yet but as soon as they
[00:55] do they'll they would realize that
[00:57] spending and replacing of Bitcoin is
[00:59] very important Bitcoin is supposed to be
[01:00] the peaceful Revolution and one of the
[01:01] reasons that I'm in Bitcoin is to give a
[01:03] finger to to the regulators and to the
[01:04] rate Seekers that are trying to control
[01:06] us Austrian economics is actually the
[01:07] only economics system that that has made
[01:10] any progress in the last 200 years
[01:12] because they're just like accepting
[01:14] reality and
[01:15] [Music]
[01:18] logic I saw actually that you take
[01:21] Bitcoin only to to another level uh
[01:24] because most people that talk about
[01:25] Bitcoin only they are like um just
[01:28] having Bitcoin as their Reserve currency
[01:30] as their Reserve asset in their their
[01:33] own personal balance sheet but they
[01:35] usually still pay with with feat and
[01:38] they still uh accept feed it and their
[01:40] businesses and all those thing but you
[01:42] actually go ahead and say no no our
[01:44] business is Bitcoin only we only except
[01:46] Bitcoin no shitcoins and no Fiat
[01:49] currencies which is a a really big step
[01:52] and I love that that you do uh DED that
[01:56] but why did you take that like why uh
[01:59] not say like oh we we also take business
[02:01] in in in feed currencies we're trying to
[02:05] to to to build the the the Bitcoin
[02:07] circular economy out and have uh more
[02:10] people around the world use Bitcoin only
[02:12] and I think that's just a natural step
[02:14] um I using Bitcoin only does come with
[02:17] its advantages and its
[02:19] disadvantages um but the advantages so
[02:22] far I think um
[02:24] um our chance the disadvantages by by a
[02:27] long shot for us um I mean the the
[02:30] biggest one obviously being the the ease
[02:32] and
[02:33] the of doing business we don't have to
[02:36] succumb to as much regulation as when
[02:39] you when you have a Fiat bank account
[02:40] that's usually where they start tying
[02:42] the news and also um by accept in bit
[02:46] ear we we don't have to operate or have
[02:48] a footprint in any specific jurisdiction
[02:51] as long as someone can access our
[02:52] website and they're able to pass through
[02:54] the Bitcoin Network um or through
[02:56] lightning they can use our service and I
[02:59] think that's a huge Advantage man yeah I
[03:01] I didn't even thought about that thing
[03:03] because if you have just a Bitcoin
[03:05] wallet that is completely separate from
[03:07] anything else that you're doing and you
[03:10] only accept Bitcoin and there's like no
[03:12] no hint to that like you can basically
[03:14] do it completely outside of the the Fiat
[03:18] traditional Fiat uh system it's I I
[03:21] never thought about that uh Point
[03:24] actually is really really cool but I
[03:26] guess it's uh it's still quite early to
[03:30] to to do that is there any like hurdles
[03:32] that you have had to go through with
[03:34] adopt adopting Bitcoin with maybe also
[03:37] with with paying uh things for for the
[03:41] the business how how do you go about
[03:43] that yeah so I mean this is uh I think
[03:46] it's also another feature and not a bug
[03:48] so we we only pay people in Bitcoin as
[03:51] well if and that helps because we're
[03:54] forced to any use Bitcoin basically
[03:57] which is awesome and um
[04:00] um there has been a couple of instances
[04:03] where someone um wanted to do something
[04:05] for us um um we need to pay them and we
[04:09] said okay we'll use you your service or
[04:10] whatever but we can only pay in Bitcoin
[04:12] and then then they otherwise they
[04:15] wouldn't have thought about or had
[04:16] accepted Bitcoin but now because we're
[04:18] taking that hard stance they want the
[04:20] business um we they created bitcoin and
[04:24] wallet I've helped a couple of people
[04:27] like that and then they accept Bitcoin
[04:30] um so that's also part of the adoption
[04:32] cycle um helping to onboard new people
[04:35] like
[04:36] that that is interesting it's really uh
[04:39] cool to see with that uh uh pushing uh
[04:43] this Bitcoin adoption forward and you
[04:46] don't have like if you pay everyone in
[04:48] Bitcoin and if you only accept Bitcoin
[04:51] then you never have to like have to have
[04:53] like sell your Bitcoin to fear it and
[04:55] then pay someone or to lend against it
[04:58] and all those things um do you do
[05:00] personally also uh more this Bitcoin
[05:04] only approach or like can can you do
[05:07] this even in in your wherever you are so
[05:10] in South Africa um it's definitely it
[05:12] would definitely be possible and I try
[05:14] and live on a Bitcoin standard to the
[05:16] largest extent possible for Me For
[05:18] Myself um unfortunately the the like the
[05:20] place that I rent and I still have
[05:23] insurance and um like Medi Medical Care
[05:27] um medical insurance as well sorry uh
[05:30] that I need to pay in feat so stuff like
[05:33] that isn't isn't
[05:34] available um and like a the
[05:37] mainstream gym that I go to as well
[05:40] stuff like that it's it's you can't pay
[05:42] you don't have a choice um to use
[05:44] Bitcoin for that for else everything
[05:46] else in a lot of other stuff in South
[05:48] Africa we you will be able you'll be
[05:50] able to travel to through South Africa
[05:52] um with Bitcoin only so I
[05:55] um I just I only transfer as as little
[05:59] money as possible to Fiat from um from
[06:02] my Bitcoin stack to to cover the like
[06:05] the expenses
[06:06] needed um but there's a some mainstream
[06:11] um chains of shops that already except
[06:15] Bitcoin and Lighting in South Africa and
[06:18] you can do you can buy almost anything
[06:19] online using Bitcoin and obviously bit
[06:21] bit bit refill is also huge here so so
[06:25] um then now hopefully with airb Toc if
[06:28] we get enough listings you can travel
[06:30] pay for accommodation with Bitcoin as
[06:32] well so so yeah South Africa uh it's
[06:36] definitely possible to to to live on on
[06:38] on a Bitcoin standard to to a very large
[06:40] extent how long are you are you doing
[06:42] that with air PTC and and trying to live
[06:45] on a Bitcoin
[06:46] standard so I've been living tried
[06:49] living on a Bitcoin standard about since
[06:52] 2022
[06:53] um and I just launched a BTC in the
[06:57] middle of July this year so we're just a
[07:00] couple of months old and um things have
[07:03] been going quite well the Bitcoin
[07:05] Community has taken the launch very well
[07:07] we we had a lot of feedback and a lot of
[07:09] reaction um from from fans and users and
[07:13] um yeah I'm hoping I'm hoping we can
[07:15] make this this project work absolutely
[07:18] really cool um one thing that one
[07:20] question that probably comes up in
[07:21] everyone's head is uh is is the
[07:24] volatility um is it such a big thing
[07:27] once you actually go ahead or is it just
[07:29] just like a fear that people have in
[07:30] their head and it's it's it's like a
[07:33] nothing broker in the end of the day um
[07:35] I think that beens so so if you so what
[07:37] I do is um um salary that I earn um goes
[07:42] directly into Bitcoin so I mean you
[07:44] don't you don't you don't have to earn
[07:45] the physical Bitcoin you can um you can
[07:48] use like um certain uh
[07:53] um
[07:55] uh what's that what's that um company's
[07:58] name um where you going to get paid in
[07:59] Bitcoin um you you you give the invoice
[08:03] um B refill Isen to my is my head now
[08:06] yeah but I mean I your as your your
[08:08] salary comes in you convert it directly
[08:10] to bitcoin and um you just convert as
[08:13] much as least possible to to feed as you
[08:16] can and then um so so the volatility
[08:18] will only basically um hinder you for
[08:21] that particular month um and that hasn't
[08:25] really happened to me um since I've been
[08:28] on the mostly on bitcoin standard I I
[08:31] haven't really lost money if I can put
[08:33] it that way but it definitely makes you
[08:36] feel richer and putter as the Bitcoin
[08:38] goes up and down I mean uh as as the
[08:41] Bitcoin price um decreases and my my
[08:45] whole stack decreases and my net worth
[08:47] is worth a lot less and I start spending
[08:49] less as well and then as when Bitcoin
[08:51] goes up then I feel richer and I spend
[08:53] more as well I mean we're all still
[08:55] economic beings and that definitely has
[08:57] a huge impact um and that's why um I
[09:00] also think for um you know service such
[09:03] as air BTC when uh when Bitcoin goes up
[09:05] a lot say Bitcoin reaches
[09:08] 200k um I think uh a lot of more bit
[09:11] winners will feel reach and start
[09:13] spending a little bit more um hopefully
[09:14] on their travel as well do you set the
[09:17] prices uh like on rbtc all the prices
[09:21] are as you saw in Sates or like set in
[09:24] Bitcoin uh do do they change like do do
[09:27] you change the the prices of that or the
[09:32] the vendors are changing the price of
[09:33] that once Bitcoin like goes up like 10%
[09:36] I think like in the last year Bitcoin
[09:38] went up like double or something like
[09:40] that yeah that we made that mistake um
[09:43] so when I first launched um I I said I
[09:46] don't want um even a Fiat currency
[09:48] symbol on the website we we want to be
[09:50] Bitcoin only Bitcoin only um to such an
[09:52] extent that um we don't want anything
[09:54] even mentioning Fiat but unfortunately
[09:57] that that's unworkable the stage so um
[10:01] people listed their properties put the
[10:03] prices in and um bitcoin's price went up
[10:06] like 10% in two weeks and suddenly all
[10:08] the all the prices on the on the whole
[10:09] website was 10% more expensive so we um
[10:13] I had to change that so what we're doing
[10:14] now is um um we we we're denominating
[10:19] the the prices in in in Fiat in
[10:22] dollars and then just transferring that
[10:24] amount um on the moment of payment um to
[10:28] to bitcoin and then we also have a
[10:30] converter on the side which in in real
[10:33] time converts all the prices to to
[10:34] display Bitcoin but that changes as
[10:36] bitcoin price goes up and down so like
[10:39] how that would work in practice is a
[10:41] host would say arguments like a property
[10:43] is $100 per night they would type in
[10:45] $100 and then we would change that price
[10:48] to SATs which we display on the front
[10:50] end and as bitcoin's price goes up and
[10:52] down that amount of sets that's
[10:53] displayed goes up and down with with the
[10:56] Bitcoin price with the at the end of the
[10:58] day the the the the the the user or the
[11:02] the the the guest will will pay the
[11:05] Bitcoin equivalent of $100 at the moment
[11:08] of
[11:09] booking so in a way you are not in the
[11:14] face of Bitcoin as a unit of account but
[11:16] Bitcoin has a medium of exchange till
[11:19] now because of uh the still of the
[11:22] volatility as as as bitcoin price
[11:25] increase of 10% would make the the
[11:27] website significantly more expensive all
[11:29] of a sudden yeah or or a decrease as
[11:32] well um and um I mean volatility is
[11:35] often more than 10% in a month so that
[11:38] it is a huge problem I mean we would
[11:40] love to be Bitcoin only like that as
[11:42] well but Bitcoin just unfortunately it
[11:45] it isn't a unit of account yet so um
[11:48] some people have started using it but
[11:50] it's it's very problematic
[11:52] because you have to basically have mass
[11:54] adoption for that to work so I think as
[11:57] fat currencies fail and people will um
[11:59] people start using Bitcoin like 90% of
[12:02] the population and then the Fiat price
[12:04] of Bitcoin won't matter anymore and then
[12:06] Bitcoin will become unit the the most
[12:09] used usit of account by default but I
[12:12] mean we're at least 10 years away from
[12:14] that hopefully 10 years maybe even
[12:15] probably longer um do do do you think
[12:18] that it's important that people spend
[12:21] their Bitcoin right now yes so I mean I
[12:24] think it's very important um the one of
[12:26] the main um narratives that I'm pushing
[12:29] is uh spending in
[12:30] replace and I think um I've explained
[12:34] this uh before but a lot I've had a lot
[12:37] of uh um Bitcoin is criticizing that
[12:39] approach why would I spend my stack it's
[12:42] all but you don't have to spend your
[12:43] stack you can as I said you can spend in
[12:45] replace so whatever you would spend on
[12:48] on on Fiat or with your Fiat you just
[12:51] buy Bitcoin and then you spend that
[12:52] rather and you have to we have to get
[12:54] the Bitcoin circular circular economy as
[12:56] strong as possible as soon as possible
[12:58] um for various reasons but I mean as a
[13:01] bitcoiner if you're not doing that who's
[13:04] going to do it because if you're sitting
[13:06] with your Bitcoin in your hard wallet
[13:09] and five years from now Bitcoin is
[13:11] 500,000 and you decide you want to sell
[13:14] or you want to spend your Bitcoin and
[13:15] there's no circular economy to spend it
[13:17] on um I highly doubt that hardcore
[13:21] bitcoiners would want to transfer that
[13:23] Bitcoin that they stored offline to to
[13:27] their local exchange and sell it for
[13:28] Fiat and and pay tax on that and then
[13:30] use that feat again
[13:32] and that's I don't think that's the plan
[13:35] and I think most bitcoiners just haven't
[13:37] thought that far ahead yet but as soon
[13:39] as they do they'll they would realize
[13:41] that spending and replacing of Bitcoin
[13:43] is is very important like tax
[13:46] implications are interesting because
[13:47] like that's probably the thing that most
[13:50] people uh that's why they don't want to
[13:53] spend the Bitcoin because they are
[13:56] fearful of the tax implication right now
[13:59] uh I know for example in Austria if you
[14:01] haven't bought your Bitcoin before 2021
[14:03] so if you bought the Bitcoin starting I
[14:06] think February 2121 on all profits that
[14:09] you make from that uh there's a
[14:12] 27.5% tax on that which is a really high
[14:15] one um and people are like oh like if I
[14:19] pay I don't know if I got my Bitcoin
[14:22] like in in in that one month in
[14:24] September and then like a few months
[14:26] later Bitcoin shoots up uh two two times
[14:30] then I have to pay uh the the Capal
[14:32] gains tax um so so I think sometimes
[14:36] it's it's it's going to be hard or even
[14:38] or do you think that even if there's a
[14:40] tax implication it's it's still
[14:42] beneficial to to completely be on a
[14:44] Bitcoin standard yeah I mean that's
[14:46] that's a tough one but um I mean Bitcoin
[14:48] is supposed to be the peaceful
[14:49] Revolution and that's the whole idea um
[14:52] I mean as a I mean I think 90% of
[14:56] Bitcoin is out there would consider
[14:59] um attacks like that um um unfair and
[15:04] and I mean that's all idea is if if I
[15:07] buy a bicycle from you with my Bitcoin
[15:09] there's no way that they can know um I
[15:12] mean that's the whole idea um that's one
[15:14] of the reasons that I'm in Bitcoin is to
[15:16] is to give a finger to the to to to the
[15:18] regulators and to the to the red Seekers
[15:20] um that that are trying to control us so
[15:22] I mean that that depends on person to
[15:24] person if you want to take that chance I
[15:26] mean I'm not saying you should do it um
[15:28] but um the all IDE is to make it as hard
[15:30] as possible for these people to to to
[15:32] enforce these these ridiculous and insan
[15:35] tax laws and regulations and stuff
[15:37] absolutely yeah that that's very true
[15:39] really cool and you're also big on
[15:41] austan economics and uh even though I am
[15:44] in Austria I'm I would not consider
[15:47] myself an Austrian economics um expert
[15:51] I'm definitely uh love the the the
[15:54] theory and the idea behind it but I'm
[15:56] far away from an expert in that one um
[15:59] what is the main thing that you took
[16:01] away from austan economics uh and is
[16:04] that relating is like that's the reason
[16:07] why you're now so uh bullish on bitcoin
[16:10] and also spending Bitcoin and being so
[16:12] far ahead of the curve yes I I mean the
[16:15] the I think the main takeway for for for
[16:17] most people who get into Austrian
[16:18] economics is um it's it's a huge eye
[16:21] opener when you first find out that uh a
[16:23] currency doesn't need to keep on
[16:25] inflating for it to be successfully used
[16:27] as a currency in in a given economy um I
[16:31] mean we we're taught that inflation is
[16:33] normal and that in fact it's good for
[16:37] for for
[16:38] you at everyone has been taught that in
[16:40] school and in an economics class um and
[16:43] when you first but I me I think most
[16:46] people out there at least if you have
[16:49] like a little bit of contrarian in you
[16:51] um you always kind of knew that that was
[16:55]  I remember when I was at school
[16:57] like taking Fair classes I I always
[17:00] thought yes but you know they're
[17:03] teaching this but it just doesn't like
[17:05] something just doesn't feel right here
[17:07] for me I mean even like when I was 16
[17:09] years old that didn't just didn't feel I
[17:12] knew there was a fish in a snake in the
[17:14] grass there somewhere and um when I when
[17:17] I eventually found the austan economics
[17:19] um everything just started making a lot
[17:22] more sense um but I mean there's there
[17:24] there's so much interesting stuff to
[17:26] learn um and in the Austrian School
[17:29] I mean mises's um socialist calculation
[17:32] problem is it's it's really interesting
[17:33] and cool um and I mean just to the
[17:37] general um like production Theory and
[17:40] how you have you first have to
[17:42] accumulate um save up and accumulate
[17:45] capital and then you can spend more time
[17:47] to to produce uh to to make yourself
[17:50] more productive um maybe both tools I
[17:53] mean that that whole concept is it's
[17:55] really interesting to get into once you
[17:56] do oh okay but but is it uh the the
[17:59] learnings of Austrian economics that
[18:01] then uh made you so big on bitcoin or
[18:04] was it the other way around that Bitcoin
[18:05] introduced to the Austrian
[18:08] economics um well I think both of them
[18:10] to me both of them came more or less at
[18:12] the same time so I mean when you start
[18:14] when you're starting Bitcoin you're
[18:15] you're studying austan economics but I
[18:16] definitely found it through Bitcoin so
[18:18] um I started to learn more about Bitcoin
[18:21] and saf's name came up and I read the
[18:24] Bitcoin standard and I did these courses
[18:26] so so so that always went hand hand in
[18:29] hand for me I've always been more like
[18:31] economically entrepreneurial inclined
[18:34] than technical so I
[18:37] mean way back like before I would say
[18:40] like before 2016 you basically you had
[18:43] to have you you had to be like a shady
[18:45] supercoder to be into Bitcoin basically
[18:49] um because I mean the industry was so
[18:50] small there was just basically nothing
[18:51] else you could do could then people
[18:54] started writing and a lot of cool stuff
[18:57] come out and I think safe was played key
[18:59] role to introduce the Austrian School to
[19:02] bitcoin although satosi also never
[19:04] mentions Austrian economics but a lot of
[19:06] the things that he mentioned in his
[19:08] writings does closely relate to Austrian
[19:11] economics wait he he never mentions it I
[19:15] thought I don't think he specifically
[19:18] mentions the Austrian School um oh I
[19:21] think he has a course on Austrian
[19:22] economics somewhere I think that that's
[19:24] why I'm confused no I'm talking about
[19:26] satachi um
[19:29] he never mentions yeah he never
[19:31] mentioned the the he never mentioned the
[19:33] a austoms the school of aics but he does
[19:36] talk about I mean obviously um creating
[19:38] creating when you create a money that um
[19:41] that that can't be inflated you probably
[19:44] did was well versed in it yeah
[19:46] absolutely I thought you talk about CCI
[19:48] I was like yeah no definely he's huge a
[19:52] economics we we literally wrot the
[19:55] books yeah absolutely that's why I was
[19:58] for a moment very
[20:02] confused it's really interesting uh I
[20:04] think there's the the white paper is uh
[20:08] such a a small Sleek thing uh and it
[20:10] introduces such a radical and such an
[20:13] amazing idea which could completely
[20:15] change finances forever and it's just
[20:18] like a few pages it's it's like it's
[20:21] pretty amazing that uh one guy girl
[20:25] group of people whatever is actually
[20:27] just like changing five es forever just
[20:30] by getting the ideas that we're already
[20:33] there together in a in the Right Mix and
[20:36] just like putting it out there and then
[20:37] even leaving that thing uh what was it
[20:41] one or two years later or three years
[20:43] later completely alone and saying like
[20:45] hey this this this thing will work uh I
[20:48] will move on to other projects like that
[20:50] that that story is I I still I still
[20:54] look forward to like a really big movie
[20:56] on that I feel like there has not been
[20:59] there's some documentaries there's some
[21:00] interesting stuff on there but there has
[21:02] to be some one big story or movie that
[21:06] like is is really famous coming out that
[21:09] moment we didn't have to now I feel like
[21:12] yeah definitely I mean if if if Bitcoin
[21:15] um does what we think it will and
[21:17] becomes the the the the next money to be
[21:20] used across the world for the next
[21:22] however long like hundreds of years
[21:24] thousands of years even maybe um I mean
[21:26] in the future stuff like that will def
[21:28] start coming out especially
[21:30] the I always want to compare it to the
[21:33] Bible first the first people who started
[21:35] adopting it would would be like the
[21:37] disciples in the Christian Bible you
[21:39] know it would be um they would there
[21:42] will be stuff written about them for for
[21:45] for generations to come yeah absolutely
[21:47] it's
[21:49] interesting I made some podcasts around
[21:52] uh like con connecting or comparing even
[21:54] like Bitcoin to religions uh and there's
[21:57] like a really deep rabbit hole around it
[21:59] how who was it co I think has the the
[22:02] book uh with with uh how how's the book
[22:05] called I forgot the the name of the book
[22:07] but Pastor coin wrote like Bitcoin the
[22:10] or something like that I I saw that book
[22:12] it looks really cool yeah I I still
[22:14] wanted to get around to reading it and
[22:17] um yeah I I know Pastor K follow him on
[22:20] Twitter um it looks really interesting
[22:23] but do you see a connection there with
[22:26] with religion or is it just because uh
[22:28] it's such a a massive idea that of
[22:31] course the early group is kind of
[22:33] religious about
[22:34] it I mean I I see a lot of a lot of um
[22:38] Sim similarities not just between
[22:40] Christianity and Bitcoin but but but I
[22:42] mean most a lot a lot of different
[22:44] religions I mean um I think uh the the
[22:48] the belief system around Bitcoin mirrors
[22:51] the the type of belief that you have to
[22:54] uh practice to to to to to be religious
[22:57] um and also there's such a lot of
[22:59] similarities with the characters
[23:01] involved and satachi um being like
[23:03] almost like this mythical
[23:05] figure um and um yeah I mean b
[23:09] bitcoiners are treating this I mean if
[23:12] if if you take certain types of
[23:14] Christianity certain certain like
[23:16] Christian sex who who go out and I think
[23:21] it's the seventh day atst that they they
[23:23] go out and knock on people's door and
[23:24] try and convert them to
[23:26] Christianity it's a lot the same with
[23:28] Bitcoin I mean um we also go out and
[23:32] everyone as soon as they um like first
[23:35] discover Bitcoin and like their mind
[23:37] opens and they realize what's really
[23:39] what really is going on they immediately
[23:41] want to go out and tell everyone they
[23:42] know about it it's almost like
[23:44] Evangelical it's like a they're filled
[23:47] with the spirit of citation they want to
[23:50] help other people find it as well so I
[23:52] mean there's a lot of similarities like
[23:53] that and I think um I think there's
[23:56] still a lot of work to be done to
[23:57] compare Bitcoin to to religion I mean
[23:59] there's a lot of a lot of Articles and
[24:02] books and stuff out there already but I
[24:05] that's for a good reason absolutely yeah
[24:07] um but coming a little bit back to to a
[24:09] economics because I really want to get
[24:11] also in that topic with you as uh you
[24:14] you seem to be big on AUST economics you
[24:15] have the the Twitter Panner with mises
[24:18] and and the people on there and you
[24:20] wrote a economics um for people and I
[24:24] know there are probably uh some people
[24:26] in there that um have heard about atin
[24:29] economics but are not as aware of atin
[24:32] Economics uh especially new people in
[24:34] Bitcoin um what is the basic theory of
[24:38] austan economics how would you define uh
[24:41] what what aan economic uh really means
[24:43] and what it is a economics to me um is
[24:47] real economics it's it starts at the um
[24:51] almost to say at the bottom like with
[24:52] they believe um that everything that's
[24:56] created in economy is because of humans
[24:57] acting so that's why one of the main
[25:00] books in a economics from mises's like B
[25:03] greatest work um is called Human Action
[25:05] it's because um the whole economy is
[25:07] made up of humans making decisions on a
[25:10] daily basis and acting upon those
[25:12] decisions while um and and and
[25:15] everything then builds up from there and
[25:18] um it connects and makes sense they're
[25:23] trying to really figure out what's going
[25:24] on while the other schools of Economics
[25:27] are just like they think that the that
[25:29] the economy or an economy out there is
[25:32] just like a machine that you can
[25:33] basically control it's like knobs that
[25:34] they can turn in reality no Market works
[25:37] like that every single day everyone
[25:40] makes in the whole economy makes
[25:42] decisions and there's no way that you
[25:44] can um turn a knob or or or up a
[25:51] interest rate for a tax and and and and
[25:54] control the economy to to the extent
[25:55] that you think you can that's in fact
[25:57] impossible so I mean um every single
[26:01] thing that you that you every single
[26:03] penny that you throw into that pool um
[26:06] trying to trying to to to change
[26:08] something has a ripple effect through
[26:10] the whole Market through the whole
[26:12] economy which changes everything that
[26:14] you it's impossible to to know what
[26:17] changes there are going to be with every
[26:18] single tweak that you try to make that's
[26:21] why doesn't matter how good and feir
[26:24] Economist is the outcome is always bad
[26:27] um when a government tries to intervene
[26:29] there isn't something like good
[26:30] intervention or bad intervention all
[26:31] intervention is bad because
[26:33] they're they're just interfering with
[26:36] what the free market wants and what the
[26:38] free market wants is what always what is
[26:39] based um in an economy it feels like
[26:43] that a or is it fair to say that austan
[26:46] economics is the natural state of
[26:48] economics and all all the other schools
[26:50] are just trying to manipulate nature I I
[26:54] think I think that's true to to to a
[26:55] large extent yes um um
[26:58] so I mean um mango um came up with the
[27:03] like the marginal revolution in like
[27:06] 1870s um so before that no one no one as
[27:10] economics the school of Economics
[27:13] economic for in the world progress one
[27:15] of the huge problems was what is value
[27:17] how do you value things how do how do
[27:19] people value things and before mango um
[27:22] like the the the best theory that was
[27:24] out there or the most popular theory was
[27:27] um the cost theory or and the labor
[27:29] theory of money which is basically
[27:30] whatever something cost that is what
[27:32] it's worth or whatever labor someone put
[27:33] into it is what is worth which if anyone
[27:36] goes
[27:37] and just rationally think about that
[27:39] it's it's complete how um just
[27:42] because you spend time on something with
[27:44] your labor doesn't mean it's worth
[27:45] anything I can go and dig a hole in my
[27:47] backyard the one day and I can then I
[27:49] can throw that hole close it again the
[27:51] next day I would have worked two days
[27:53] but I that doesn't mean that what I've
[27:55] what I did was as any worth to anyone
[27:58] else or to me and the same with the cost
[28:00] theory um just because something costs
[28:03] something to produce doesn't mean that
[28:04] it's worth whatever you put into to I
[28:06] mean that that that's just I mean it's
[28:08] impossible for someone to to argue
[28:10] against that that's just basic logic so
[28:12] so Banger came up with a the with um um
[28:17] with his theory which it was like a huge
[28:21] Next Step Up For for economics in
[28:23] general in the world but um the canans
[28:26] and socialists like like kind
[28:29] of I I want to say just ignored that and
[28:32] went on in the previous um um um um way
[28:36] without without like recognizing that
[28:39] that that that exists and bold on top of
[28:42] the theories with that which I had
[28:44] without taking taking the module into
[28:48] into account so so now um so so Austrian
[28:52] economics actually the only economics
[28:55] system that or or or thought school that
[28:57] is made progress in the law 200 years um
[29:02] because they're just like accepting
[29:04] reality and logic while the other other
[29:07] other forms of of Economics I mean at
[29:09] this stage I think you know socialist
[29:12] thought socialist economic thought is so
[29:14] ridiculous I mean if but but no one I
[29:17] don't even think anyone still takes that
[29:20] stuff seriously but um at least
[29:23] cians they um they're just basically
[29:27] pandering to to to create more money so
[29:29] the whole idea isn't to to do anything
[29:31] good the whole idea is to come up with
[29:32] excuses for your government and Banks to
[29:34] print more money that's that's what
[29:36] motivates them if you go and have a look
[29:37] at who they have given um the Nobel
[29:41] Prize to um that's always true the Noel
[29:43] priz is always given to someone who came
[29:45] up with a new best excuse to print money
[29:47] the Lost guy like
[29:49] banki um he was given the price because
[29:52] he because when they got into the
[29:54] in 2008 he was the one that was able to
[29:56] come up with an excuse to print
[29:58] trillions of dollars and and save uh
[30:00] save save the the banking system so um
[30:04] yeah if you want a Nobel prize in
[30:05] economics that's what you have to do you
[30:06] have to come up with a a great idea for
[30:09] government and Banks to to print money
[30:11] in you'll probably make
[30:12] it I L that a lot um what was the the
[30:17] mango Theory called the marginal
[30:19] Revolution what what what is that
[30:20] exactly if you watch or listen to my
[30:23] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[30:25] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[30:28] most important step is to keep the
[30:31] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[30:33] wallet my personal recommendation for
[30:35] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[30:38] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[30:40] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[30:43] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[30:46] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[30:49] the checkout visit bitbox Swiss SL
[30:53] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[30:56] step is to really level up your
[30:58] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:00] have the most secure self- custody setup
[31:03] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:06] have to protect your privacy you have to
[31:09] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:12] on where you live you even want to have
[31:14] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:17] move in case something goes really
[31:19] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:21] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[31:23] step by step and if you visit the
[31:26] Bitcoin way.com SL Partners SL Robin you
[31:30] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[31:33] out how you can level up your
[31:35] sovereignty and last but not least I
[31:37] have something completely new for you
[31:40] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[31:44] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[31:47] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[31:50] look at that beauty I love it so much
[31:52] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[31:55] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[31:58] way to go out there and show that you
[32:01] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:04] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:07] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:10] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:13] collections you have the date of the
[32:15] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[32:18] and of course also the block height and
[32:21] which aepo we are currently in I love
[32:24] the level of detail they put in in this
[32:27] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[32:29] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[32:32] down in the descriptions I love those
[32:35] watches so so much yeah so so so the the
[32:40] the you come up with the theory of
[32:42] marginal utility which is I mean it's a
[32:44] little bit complicated to explain in
[32:45] detail on on on on the it's easy to
[32:48] understand when you have Graphics in
[32:49] front of you um as but but but but but
[32:52] basically what what it is is every every
[32:55] next unit of any economic good that that
[32:58] a human acquires has less value to him
[33:01] than the previous value than the
[33:03] previous unit of the same good so um I
[33:06] think manger uses horses to explain it
[33:08] so when you when you for arguments like
[33:12] when you're when you're a farmer and you
[33:13] have one horse that that you would use
[33:15] that horse for your own transport and
[33:17] then when you have two horses um you
[33:19] might use the second horse for for for
[33:22] for something that you wouldn't have
[33:23] used the first do for so that might be
[33:25] something like plowing your field build
[33:28] s or whatever and then when you have
[33:29] three horses you might lend one to your
[33:31] neighbor but the point of the of the
[33:33] theory is that that that third horse
[33:35] doesn't have that much value to you as a
[33:37] person as the first horse um and it's
[33:40] like that with
[33:41] everything so um that is basically how
[33:45] that that explains how humans um
[33:49] perceive value is it that thing yes yeah
[33:53] exactly that's that's that that's one of
[33:55] the tables yes so I mean that table will
[33:59] will explain to you how you see if you
[34:01] look at the top left you have one unit
[34:03] of one good that has 10 units of value
[34:06] the second unit will have
[34:09] nine the second un unit will have nine
[34:11] the third unit will have eight so I mean
[34:14] I think this looks it's his consumption
[34:16] so that that would probably be some kind
[34:17] of food so if you're really hungry and
[34:19] you have a 10 sandwiches the first
[34:21] sandwich that you eat will be like I
[34:24] have massive value for you then you're a
[34:26] little bit more full or whatever
[34:28] and then now you atat a second sandwich
[34:29] by the time you get to the fifth
[34:30] sandwich you might be so full that you
[34:32] don't want even want that sandwich it
[34:33] has zero value to you um so that's the
[34:36] theory of marginal utility interesting
[34:39] yeah it's like the that uh the theory of
[34:43] like if you have if you worked like TW
[34:47] uh 15 years to be able to like um afford
[34:51] one car that is maybe not the best car
[34:54] but it brings you from A to B and you
[34:56] never have own the car before it's like
[34:59] this is like your biggest thing ever uh
[35:02] but if you have like five Bugattis in
[35:04] your garage like a a a normal
[35:08] mediumsized car is probably worth
[35:11] nothing for you is that that kind of a
[35:14] theory for is is that comparable to
[35:17] that yeah well in in in this it will
[35:19] just be when you already have five
[35:21] Bugattis the six one won't be won't have
[35:24] the as much value to you as as the first
[35:27] one um or the second or the third or the
[35:29] fourth one and the the the the the value
[35:33] declines for you the valid clients of
[35:36] each of for each extra unit you consume
[35:39] or or or or or have or or get oh that's
[35:42] that's really cool it's
[35:44] also yeah yeah then I mean he goes
[35:48] further and then every human has
[35:50] different scale of value a marginal
[35:53] value for every for for different for
[35:55] every different good so I'm prefer like
[35:59] in that like tobacco someone else might
[36:01] prefer alcohol or someone else might
[36:02] prefer I don't know whatever meat and we
[36:05] have all the the the this the scale will
[36:10] will will will change for every single
[36:12] person depending on what on his
[36:13] preferences so that that that just also
[36:16] I mean if if you go forward with that
[36:18] theory it explains why the market is so
[36:21] important to to be able to to to know
[36:25] what every what humans want because
[36:27] there's no way to find out what humans
[36:29] want to consume if the market can't
[36:32] calculate that because it's it's
[36:33] impossible for a government to know what
[36:36] I what what what I would choose tomorrow
[36:39] to to consume because I don't even know
[36:41] what I'm going to choose tomorrow I
[36:42] might go to the shop and I might see
[36:43] something you know so no person even
[36:46] knows what they what themelves will will
[36:48] do tomorrow but now the government like
[36:50] in a socialist system wants to wants to
[36:53] decide what you are going to be doing
[36:55] not only tomorrow but even in a year
[36:57] from now which is impossible that's why
[36:59] and that makes it impossible to produce
[37:02] the right Goods that people want to
[37:03] consume so the the proper chains in the
[37:06] production
[37:07] does is impossible to to to it's
[37:10] impossible for for that to exist so um
[37:14] that's what um like mis's greatest work
[37:17] was on um sorry I just set a call now um
[37:22] so so so yeah so the the Socialist
[37:24] calculation problem then gets built on
[37:27] top of that
[37:28] and socialists basically it's it's it's
[37:30] impossible for them to to to get the
[37:33] factors of production stra that's why
[37:35] they to get it accurately um so so it's
[37:38] um that's why socialism just can't work
[37:40] at
[37:41] all you just uh wanted to say something
[37:44] about misa's biggest contribution before
[37:47] the call yeah the the the the Socialist
[37:49] calculation problem um there's like a
[37:53] great video on that um it's actually a
[37:56] great series that I would recommend on
[37:58] YouTube it's called masters of Austrian
[38:00] economics so this stuff that I just
[38:01] spoke about you can go and check that
[38:03] out so um it's by it's that the YouTube
[38:06] account is academic agent and um so I
[38:09] think there's six videos the first one
[38:11] is mangu the second one is um B Bon
[38:14] third one is mises the third one I think
[38:16] is haak and then it's rothbard um but
[38:19] it's it's it's it's really good to have
[38:21] to watch order start with mango is it's
[38:23] kind of um is is Bitcoin kind of the
[38:28] final form of austan Economics money is
[38:31] is is it possible that that that's the
[38:34] last thing that we will ever
[38:35] need definitely it's definitely possible
[38:38] I mean it's not certain who knows what
[38:39] will happen in the future but I I
[38:41] definitely think that Bitcoin is the
[38:43] slly round about way that haak talked
[38:45] about um it's by far the best um way
[38:50] that we've as humans come up with um
[38:52] thus far uh the best money and the best
[38:54] way to circumvent the the current system
[38:56] so um I think I think definitely yeah I
[39:00] do do also agree with you it's also
[39:02] interesting when when we talk about atin
[39:04] economics and all all the things it it's
[39:07] a hard concept to to get around but the
[39:10] the the the value is is not something
[39:13] that you can just like I feel like
[39:15] sometimes uh traditional economic people
[39:19] really want to get like oh there's like
[39:21] one calculation and that's how I
[39:23] calculate the price of of that one thing
[39:26] for me like price and like the value
[39:29] always subjective to it like maybe
[39:31] there's one guy that that pays for a
[39:34] painting that is for me worth exactly
[39:37] $2 uh another guy pays two million for
[39:40] that because it has some value or he
[39:43] connects something with that so like I
[39:45] think that concept is is is is hard to
[39:49] crasp and that's why we need a free
[39:51] market because how can a person a
[39:55] committee h
[39:58] cator an AI super intelligence uh know
[40:03] what uh what an an art painting is worth
[40:07] or what like a sandwich is worth for
[40:09] someone and maybe the people completely
[40:11] shift to a different kind of diet uh how
[40:14] how will how will anyone predict that
[40:16] like it's it's it's impossible for me
[40:18] even like then there are people saying
[40:20] like oh like but if there are
[40:22] supercomputers on AI and they have all
[40:24] the inputs no not even that like it's
[40:26] it's it's it's for me impossible to even
[40:29] think about predicting what human
[40:32] behavior will will do in the future
[40:34] that's that's like how will we do even
[40:36] begin to do that yeah yeah exactly I
[40:40] mean I don't even know what I'm going to
[40:42] eat
[40:43] tonight so how can someone else predict
[40:46] a future like that it's it's such a
[40:48] ridiculous concept um but yeah and I can
[40:52] someone think that they can if they
[40:54] don't even know theirselves are going to
[40:56] do tomorrow I can they think that they
[40:57] can predict what the rest what someone
[41:00] else never mind one other person the
[41:01] whole whole of a country's economy will
[41:04] do I mean so so
[41:07] inside you I can laugh at it is it that
[41:11] that humans overestimate themselves uh
[41:14] like humans pay themselves as bigger
[41:17] role as they actually have in the in the
[41:19] whole world yeah definitely I mean um I
[41:21] think socialist they think highly of
[41:24] themselves they think that they I mean
[41:27] they want to be that 0.1% that's in
[41:30] control no no no one when you when you
[41:33] speak to someone who's is's like a
[41:34] socialist they never think that they are
[41:36] going to be the peasant that's being
[41:38] starved and it's going to go to the gag
[41:40] in the system which is like 99.9% of
[41:43] everyone in a socialist society they're
[41:45] always in their mind they're always the
[41:46] 0.1 who's going to be pulling the swings
[41:48] up there and making these like really
[41:51] important decisions and
[41:53] stuff
[41:55] yeah it's interesting to to think about
[41:59] that it's um it's so hard to like I I
[42:03] just had elections in in Austria I mean
[42:05] now it's a few weeks behind me but it's
[42:09] interesting when when you have the the
[42:11] Socialists always arguing oh we have to
[42:13] the tax is super rich and it's so unfair
[42:15] that they have as much and they're like
[42:16] no it's not like they have done for
[42:19] Humanity way more than someone else and
[42:22] it's just like we we we kind of have to
[42:24] accept that um a free market allows of
[42:28] that that proof of work like if you put
[42:30] a lot of proof of work in something you
[42:33] you you should have a big reward on that
[42:37] because if there's no big reward on the
[42:39] other side nobody is incentivized to do
[42:43] anything in the in the world because the
[42:45] big things are really hard and that's
[42:48] what a lot of people I feel like don't
[42:50] get about it but yeah that's just me on
[42:53] uh on on the politics side yeah yeah but
[42:56] I mean just to add to that um I mean I
[42:59] think socialist but I mean kanian
[43:02] General I mean people who not basically
[43:04] into a economics they're asking the
[43:05] wrong questions so I mean the question
[43:08] isn't what causes poverty the question
[43:10] is what causes wealth everyone is born
[43:14] like naked and poor um and then you
[43:18] start building from that so so Society
[43:20] is inherently poor and
[43:24] hungry the question is nothing causes
[43:26] that that that is that that is the the
[43:28] base layer then on so so so the question
[43:31] is how do we create the wealth I think
[43:32] that's that's where Austrian economics
[43:34] comes in as well because the the
[43:37] theories of production and stuff the
[43:39] have um explains that you in in detail
[43:41] so you have to save before you're able
[43:43] to to to to to spend on on on on
[43:46] increasing your productivity to to buy a
[43:48] new machine if you're a baker to buy
[43:50] oven um you have to you have to save
[43:52] before you can spend and then you can
[43:54] become more productive so that's that's
[43:57] how Society builds wealth or from
[44:00] Individual to societal level um and can
[44:04] economics kind of comes and turns that
[44:06] on its head and um with the like idea
[44:09] that that's not necessary you you just
[44:11] create the money and spend it on
[44:13] whatever focus of production you want
[44:14] and then it'll just work but um it
[44:17] doesn't you're you're not creating more
[44:19] you're you're only redistributing the
[44:20] wealth and um I think that I mean that's
[44:24] like a core concept that I think if more
[44:26] people can just understand that
[44:28] um the world will be bit off what do you
[44:30] think will happen to to depth and
[44:32] credits and loaning and loaning and
[44:35] borrowing and all those things in a
[44:37] society where Bitcoin is the world
[44:40] Reserve currency asset the Bitcoin
[44:43] standard is kind of enrolled so I mean
[44:45] my personal opinion on this is I think
[44:47] there will still be fractional Reserve
[44:49] Banking and I I think although Bitcoin
[44:52] will be the largest currency and
[44:54] hopefully maybe a unit of account I
[44:55] think there will still be other
[44:56] currencies Us in different jurisdictions
[44:59] so around the world I I don't see the
[45:01] world as a like a one place that will
[45:05] either adopt Bitcoin or not so different
[45:07] countries will have different Bitcoin
[45:09] strategies I'm sure it'll be outlawed in
[45:10] some countries other countries will
[45:12] embrace it and um the countries that do
[45:14] will just be much more successful and
[45:16] and Wealthy that the countries that
[45:18] don't um and they will they'll probably
[45:21] start attracting like all the youngest
[45:24] Bas young young Talent from across the
[45:26] world and s outperforming countries so
[45:28] who who decide to go against it but I
[45:30] mean that's the two extremes Banning it
[45:32] and completely accepting it but I mean
[45:33] other countries will try and tax it like
[45:36] like your country and then um I think
[45:39] there will definitely be I think we're
[45:41] very close to that I think in the next
[45:42] five years we will see like people
[45:44] trying to do fractional Reserve banking
[45:45] on top of Bitcoin um as soon as bankers
[45:49] get involved that that they're going to
[45:50] try
[45:52] and like give some kind of Bitcoin coin
[45:55] where they all the reserves but you can
[45:56] spend it and then they're going to
[45:57] create more of that than they have
[45:59] almost like FTX and that kind of stuff
[46:01] but just on a on a on a on a legi defied
[46:04] level with with with with with your
[46:06] country's fractional your country's
[46:08] Central Bank involved and um they will
[46:12] probably some of them will probably have
[46:14] some some success um and some of them
[46:17] will land out too much and file but um I
[46:22] definitely think it's possible um and
[46:25] also I think they will be
[46:28] like the on the gold standard the the
[46:30] goal of a banker it's it's it's still
[46:33] and loans and deposits it's it's still
[46:36] important so so I mean I think the quote
[46:38] is um the banker plays a important role
[46:40] in society because it takes the capital
[46:44] from those who are unable or unwilling
[46:47] or unwilling to use it in production and
[46:51] distributes it to to those who are so
[46:54] that is still a valuable service that
[46:56] that a bank provid
[46:57] so so so I think in the future there
[46:59] will be like some kind of a um like a
[47:04] full Reserve Bank where you can give
[47:06] your your your your Bitcoin to them and
[47:09] that will be like approved by the
[47:10] government or the central bank or
[47:12] whatever and they will then lend that
[47:15] money out and give you like say whatever
[47:18] 1% interest and they they will take
[47:21] 0.5 and um that's where it worked on the
[47:23] gold sard thing I think that'll
[47:25] definitely because there will still be
[47:27] people who who want to earn interest on
[47:29] the Bitcoin there there will still be
[47:31] people who want to borrow in order to
[47:34] produce um I
[47:36] mean society and an economy needs that
[47:39] function to work properly um um for the
[47:43] reasion that I just mentioned yeah
[47:45] really cool it's um it it's really
[47:49] interesting when we think about how
[47:50] bitco world how this looks like and and
[47:53] and and what the implications of that
[47:55] are um but before that um and uh it's
[48:00] it's kind of scary for me sometimes to
[48:02] think about that but we have now massive
[48:05] institutional adoption where like uh the
[48:08] edfs are buying a lot of Bitcoin there
[48:10] are big corporations that buy a lot of
[48:12] Bitcoin and they not always custody
[48:16] themselves they often custody with uh
[48:19] like coinbase and other um um people and
[48:22] other institution uh it's like do you
[48:25] feel or that there is a a chance of like
[48:28] a 6102 like conf confiscation of the
[48:33] Bitcoin that are on the those
[48:35] centralized exchanges especially when
[48:38] the US dollar is in danger or is uh
[48:41] coming to more of a hyper inflation
[48:43] scenario where the state is like hey we
[48:45] have all the Bitcoins there like just
[48:47] let's just take them and calm down the
[48:51] economy yeah definitely I mean that it's
[48:53] just a matter of time I mean it's um
[48:57] if you're if you're not in control of
[48:58] your own coins it's it's not yours I
[49:00] mean there are some exchanges that I
[49:03] personally would like and Trust more
[49:05] than others but I mean if you don't have
[49:08] your own Bitcoin um in your own custody
[49:10] you you you you walking that that risk
[49:14] so I mean you're I think it's a matter
[49:16] of time before especially like the ETFs
[49:19] and coinbase I think those coins are I
[49:22] think they're going to be confiscated
[49:24] sooner or later really like you you're
[49:26] not saying even that's a question is
[49:27] just a question of time then it's funny
[49:30] yeah I mean I I I think so I mean they
[49:32] did it like you said they did in the 30s
[49:34] with gold um why wouldn't they do that
[49:37] if they're in trouble they need they
[49:38] need the the it's it's happened many
[49:41] times before um
[49:43] it's it'll probably happen again are in
[49:45] trouble I
[49:47] mean the the expenditure and the amount
[49:50] of dep is so next
[49:52] level it's just a matter of time before
[49:55] before we have another huge crisis is
[49:57] whether that's triggered by economic
[49:58] factors or by War and then they have
[50:02] excuses to to to do basically anything
[50:04] they want and the first thing that
[50:05] they're going to do is they're going to
[50:07] take the B take the
[50:10] Bitcoin but but this is only for me
[50:13] implications on the Bitcoin that are
[50:15] there and not really Bitcoin itself um
[50:17] are we beyond the point of where Bitcoin
[50:20] actually gets captured or destroyed or
[50:23] whatever or manipulated by by the state
[50:25] pH like Bitcoin and beyond the reach
[50:28] already of of any Central institution
[50:30] yeah I think so I I think we we cross
[50:33] that like a while ago I mean if if they
[50:35] try and do anything we can just like you
[50:37] can have a we can for back without them
[50:40] whatever whatever basically the the
[50:42] community around Bitcoin decides to
[50:44] do um that will happen so so I mean that
[50:50] that's
[50:52] um that's that that's what it's it's
[50:54] impossible to to stop it because it's
[50:57] it's a it's a it's a community project
[50:58] we know and is in control
[51:01] so I think people who think that it's
[51:03] possible to to do that don't have a
[51:07] complete understanding of how of of of
[51:08] how how this actually
[51:10] works absolutely I full-heartedly agree
[51:13] with you um you have something else in
[51:15] the in the bio of yours on on on Twitter
[51:18] you have written also meat in there
[51:20] which is an inter interesting thing uh
[51:24] what has me to do the
[51:27] Bitcoin and Austrian economics well um I
[51:30] think I think safine has also like
[51:33] brought the carnival diet and meet like
[51:35] really
[51:36] into like into the Bitcoin space I
[51:39] almost want to say I don't think but I
[51:41] think um like the uh low time preference
[51:45] eating um is is ties in with like
[51:48] certain um aan economic views and but
[51:52] but but for me personally um so I'm a a
[51:55] France and
[51:57] um uh our culture in South Africa has a
[52:00] large history um of eating meat so it's
[52:04] meat is huge in our
[52:06] culture um we eat meat every single day
[52:09] like my grandmother grew up in a form in
[52:13] the ker which is like arid area in South
[52:16] Africa um it's almost like the wild west
[52:18] if can it's like a semi- desert area and
[52:20] everyone there um forms with sheep and
[52:24] um I mean those people my grandma and
[52:26] the parents they grew up eating eating
[52:29] um like lamp of sheep meat like three
[52:31] times a day morning morning um afternoon
[52:35] at night and and then sometimes they
[52:38] would eat some vegetables with it
[52:39] sometimes not and um I mean all my
[52:42] grandparents that grew up like that
[52:44] lived like that they all reached like
[52:46] above the age of 95 with very minimal um
[52:50] medical complications so I mean then
[52:52] suddenly the um the mainstream Medical
[52:57] and media comes and tells us that that's
[53:00] uhad bad for you now and I was like no
[53:02] it's not I have I literally I literally
[53:05] have four four grandparents who who who
[53:09] ate like that and and they never had any
[53:10] medical
[53:12] problem what are you're telling me and
[53:14] what I'm seeing in real life just
[53:15] doesn't make sense although it's
[53:16] anecdotal um there's there's a lot of
[53:19] that those anecdotes out there um
[53:21] especially in South Africa and in our
[53:22] culture so yeah but I mean just
[53:24] generally I just love and preparing meat
[53:27] um lamb and beef and game and um I
[53:32] prefer my meat with as much fat on it as
[53:35] possible I love that a lot um very
[53:38] really cool and before we come to the to
[53:40] the end um I have one more question
[53:43] that's probably impossible to answer but
[53:45] how would you define a Bitcoin is how
[53:48] would you uh what are the common uh
[53:51] personality traits that that that a
[53:53] bitcoiner has so well first I want to
[53:56] say um I mean I I get this a lot when I
[53:59] when I tweet from my personal account or
[54:01] or or from um the air BTC account and
[54:04] I'm mention Bitcoin is this or Bitcoin
[54:06] is that then I always get the question
[54:07] what is a Bitcoin and um I mean I've I
[54:11] like to use the um I like to think that
[54:13] like every everyone who self-identifies
[54:16] as a bitcoiner is one so I mean if you
[54:20] are getting orange pull or got orange P
[54:22] tomorrow and you decide no I'm going to
[54:24] be a Bitcoin and now no matter how
[54:25] little you know about Bitcoin if I think
[54:27] if he self identifies one then um to me
[54:30] that makes you one um I mean even if
[54:34] um I mean yeah I have to at least be
[54:36] honest about it but but but I think so
[54:38] but but I mean working with Bitcoin is
[54:40] at at air BTC the last this last couple
[54:42] of months and actually over the last
[54:44] couple of years on um that I've been
[54:45] part of the
[54:46] community I mean I think ltime
[54:49] preference and honesty and like a no
[54:53]  kind of um attitude I was
[54:57] almost want to
[54:58] say if you if you think about Karen like
[55:01] behavior in in in that
[55:03] Meme Bitcoin is is almost like whatever
[55:05] is the opposite is of that and um and
[55:09] then
[55:10] also um lack of entitlement you know I
[55:13] think Bitcoins want to actually work and
[55:16] do the proof of work before they get a
[55:18] reward otherwise that reward isn't sweet
[55:20] to them
[55:23] um I mean I've seen that a lot I with
[55:25] myself as well you don't want cheap
[55:27] price for anything and you never Bitcoin
[55:30] don't generally take take that as well
[55:32] kind of um
[55:34] if you can only be proud of something
[55:36] that you did if you if you really did
[55:38] the hard work and and achieved something
[55:40] um and I think yeah um I think Bitcoin
[55:43] is have a lot of those kind of Trades
[55:46] interesting yeah I I like it a lot how
[55:48] you how you describe it uh and I think
[55:50] also the the thing of like Bitcoin is
[55:53] one that describes himself as a Bitcoin
[55:55] and that's very true uh because we
[55:58] always try to like put on that like oh
[56:01] yeah because I eat meat all bitcoiners
[56:04] have to eat meat uh it's like we portray
[56:06] something on that and I think that's
[56:09] that can be can be um not dangerous but
[56:12] it can be uh nonproductive for for the
[56:15] Bitcoin Community overall when someone
[56:17] that eats raw raw vegan comes with the
[56:19] Bitcoin plays oh like oh guess I cannot
[56:21] adopt
[56:23] Bitcoin yeah I mean it's it's I think I
[56:27] mean that's important I mean people just
[56:29] like they self project a lot in general
[56:32] not just bitcoiners or or any particular
[56:34] group but I mean that that that's one
[56:35] thing if you're into Bitcoin and you
[56:37] like meat now you think that everyone
[56:39] who's into Bitcoin must be into meat is
[56:41] and that's a natural to to feel that way
[56:44] but um it's I me that's not true Bitcoin
[56:45] doesn't care if you what you eat um
[56:48] Bitcoin doesn't care what your race or
[56:50] your sex little preferences is
[56:53] um anyone can use it throughout I mean I
[56:56] think we're just very lucky that we're
[56:58] alive at a time where we can start using
[57:00] it um I also want to say I want to say
[57:03] everyone everyone going is able to use
[57:05] it but unfortunately people like before
[57:08] 2013 was very hard to use Bitcoin before
[57:11] it existed so we're very lucky to to be
[57:14] alive in a timeline where um where we're
[57:16] able to to use Bitcoin yeah very true
[57:20] really cool um I have one question to
[57:22] ask all of my guests and the question is
[57:25] what can we learn from you besides
[57:28] Bitcoin and I will add for you also a
[57:31] economics so what what can we learn from
[57:33] you besides that um well I think I mean
[57:37] this also just ties in with the Bitcoin
[57:39] uh EOS in general but um I I think like
[57:44] taking care of your body healthwise is
[57:46] really um really um important and um
[57:50] I've been in a health and fitness
[57:51] journey throughout my life where I've
[57:53] tried almost everything there is and um
[57:57] the the one thing that I've that really
[57:59] stood out to me which I think is like
[58:01] underrated and I think it it can it will
[58:03] become it'll still become like a a
[58:06] Bitcoin or thing in the future is is
[58:08] calisthenics um like body weight
[58:10] exercises it's um it's that really stuck
[58:15] with me it's I find that much much
[58:17] better um on various different levels
[58:21] than going doing we training in the gym
[58:24] um or other um Fitness or exercise
[58:27] methods for that for that matter but um
[58:30] I think um I think uh I think that's
[58:32] going to be that that that might be
[58:34] something that that's still going to be
[58:36] a meme in the Bitcoin space in the next
[58:38] couple of
[58:39] years yeah weightlifting seems to be not
[58:42] the really popular thing and I do
[58:44] actually both of them like I try to do
[58:47] uh callisthenics and after calisthenics
[58:51] do one or two exercises with
[58:53] weightlifting uh it's like uh I get I
[58:57] get compared a lot with Arnold Shen but
[58:59] I'm nowhere
[59:03] close strugging to go like three four
[59:05] times per per week into the gym and try
[59:08] to keep uh my body at least in shape uh
[59:12] but I think callisthenics is really nice
[59:14] like uh sometimes I see people in in the
[59:17] gym that do the callisthenics and I'm
[59:19] like just impressed on the level of
[59:22] control they have over their own body uh
[59:24] that's that's something really really um
[59:28] cool and something that I want to get
[59:29] more into and I love that you brought
[59:32] that in the podcast because it's it's a
[59:34] good good way of of improving your
[59:37] overall Mobility your overall strength
[59:40] and your overall yeah just like body
[59:43] movements and and that stuff yeah really
[59:45] really cool yeah yeah and and it's it's
[59:47] it's anyone can literally do it anywhere
[59:49] across across the world no matter where
[59:51] you are you can you can you type into
[59:55] YouTube calisthenics right now um do no
[59:58] matter how unfit or fat you are there
[60:01] would be pration for you to start with
[60:03] to start doing push-ups and pull-ups all
[60:05] that stuff this it's so it scales like
[60:07] all the way to someone who's like the
[60:10] people on my 600 pound life start can
[60:12] start doing it and even if you're like
[60:15] super F and and and you're already very
[60:18] very um strong in with doing we that you
[60:22] you can slot in and start doing
[60:23] calisthenics and there like really cool
[60:25] movements to work up to like a I mean
[60:28] just Google plch or front lever I mean
[60:31] to be able to do something like that is
[60:34] incredible feel of strength for anybody
[60:35] and it's something to work up to I mean
[60:37] it's it's it gives you something to work
[60:39] to so when you're doing weights you're
[60:41] basically your any um reward is ever
[60:43] ever is to to you're going to add on
[60:45] another 5kg plate then next time you're
[60:48] going to and then the number will go up
[60:51] but in calisthenics you have like I mean
[60:53] I remember the first time where I was
[60:55] able to do a a muscle up I was so
[60:57] ecstatic I worked for a year to be able
[60:59] to do that and it's a a huge achievement
[61:01] that you can work similar to running a
[61:03] marathon or whatever so it's something
[61:05] that you can aim towards like a goal and
[61:08] that you can reach which is I think it's
[61:10] really important to keep the motivation
[61:11] up um with with exercise absolutely
[61:13] really cool and calisthenics is
[61:15] something that uh you don't need a gym
[61:18] membership at least if the weather is
[61:19] good in your area because there uh in
[61:22] most cities I saw there is somewhere
[61:24] calisthenics Park where you can go and
[61:26] just like do it uh and and save the
[61:29] Sates and and put them into
[61:32] Bitcoin exactly yeah or you can you yeah
[61:35] okay you can pause this podcast right
[61:37] now and drop and do a couple of push-ups
[61:39] or air
[61:40] squats so it's completely free true yeah
[61:44] you don't even need the kind of Stak SPX
[61:45] you can just like do something at home
[61:47] and a lot of things you can even do at
[61:49] home I mean of course the whole hanging
[61:50] things and all the things that it's it's
[61:52] nice to have something uh from from a
[61:55] ceiling and I unfortunately have a hard
[61:57] time doing that at home as I'm two
[61:59] meters tall it's like it has to be
[62:01] hanging really
[62:02] [Laughter]
[62:06] high it would be it would be cool yeah
[62:08] really cool perfect then we have end in
[62:10] the podcast where the previous guest is
[62:12] asking a question for the next guest
[62:13] without knowing who the next guest
[62:14] actually is and your question from the
[62:17] previous guest is what is the biggest
[62:19] behavioral change since you adopted a
[62:22] Bitcoin uh standard within yourself wow
[62:26] interesting one um I think I think I've
[62:29] become I've become um more hardworking
[62:33] and goal
[62:35] orientated and um I've been able to
[62:39] focus more on the things that are that's
[62:41] really important so I think the general
[62:43] in general to sum it up I think that's
[62:45] just like what low time preference does
[62:48] to you so if you start thinking long
[62:52] term um the changes the way you you you
[62:55] you you you you act um over the short
[62:57] term because you always have like that
[62:59] long-term view in in mind um and I mean
[63:04] there's a lot of things that then that
[63:06] then automatically fall in place and I
[63:08] think I mean I think I think a lot of
[63:10] bitcoinist have had that experience but
[63:12] but but definitely do in my life as well
[63:15] really cool yeah uh I can relate to that
[63:18] uh a lot really cool yeah then thank you
