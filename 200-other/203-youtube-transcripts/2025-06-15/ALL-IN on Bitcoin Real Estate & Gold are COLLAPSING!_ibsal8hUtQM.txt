[00:00] Bitcoin will eat a part of the pie that
[00:01] belongs to Gold there's only one real
[00:03] sound money the absolute sound money and
[00:05] that is yeah that is Bitcoin I recently
[00:07] sold my house in total the whole process
[00:10] it takes me like a half a year so you
[00:12] have to prepare it and you have to make
[00:13] the picture negotiate on the price
[00:15] people visiting house it's so much
[00:17] hustle to sell a house what you bought
[00:19] it for and what you did you sell it for
[00:20] it was roughly doubled in 6 years
[00:22] exactly 5 years ago in January 1st 2095
[00:25] was 45 Bitcoin now we are at 4.1 Bitcoin
[00:31] which is declining more than 90% started
[00:34] with 1 kilogram of gold at8 Bitcoin in
[00:37] 20120 and now you only need 0.8 Bitcoin
[00:41] to buy 1 kilogram of gold it's the
[00:43] demonetization of real estate in Bitcoin
[00:46] and demonetization of gold to bitcoin
[00:49] like 9us 94% I think it couldn't be
[00:52] [Music]
[00:56] clearer uh what what role uh does does
[01:00] gold play in in the in the orange
[01:02] building I remember for me I didn't got
[01:05] the value of gold before Bitcoin and
[01:08] with Bitcoin I understood gold also like
[01:11] Bitcoin kind of let me to be uh more
[01:16] four gold actually than I was before
[01:19] yeah that is that is uh it's funny
[01:21] interesting because I had exactly the
[01:23] same um so when I heard about Bitcoin
[01:27] the first time was
[01:28] 2017 uh I I think like a lot of people
[01:31] colleagues at that time I was still
[01:33] smoking smoking outside with the
[01:34] colleagues he was always busy with uh
[01:37] with his wallet and then uh it was in
[01:40] 2017 when you had of course Ripple
[01:42] everyone was talking about Ripple and I
[01:44] was like Ripple Bitcoin and that's how I
[01:46] got involved uh yeah actually for the
[01:49] for the greedy as everyone was looking
[01:52] for making some profits um and then in
[01:55] the time I started to educate uh the
[01:59] real system like okay what is behind and
[02:01] you start to read and that's also how it
[02:02] came into gold um and what interested me
[02:06] is that uh nowadays when I when I talk
[02:09] to
[02:10] people um for them everyone now sees
[02:13] around them that inflation is really a
[02:15] big thing so I live in the Netherlands
[02:17] and and here people see it when they go
[02:19] to the
[02:20] supermarket everywhere in Europe we have
[02:22] the energy prices I think also in
[02:24] Germany and Austria it's a big thing uh
[02:27] and people understand that um
[02:30] but then when you when you go a bit
[02:32] further so when you going start talk
[02:34] about sound money hard hard asset sound
[02:37] money for them it's really like they
[02:40] they don't understand what is causing
[02:43] inflation and and for me what I noticed
[02:45] that people at least understand that
[02:47] gold has a certain value and also that
[02:50] it has a value uh due uh due times that
[02:54] thousand years ago it was already a
[02:56] variable asset and um yeah like I said
[03:00] it's just interesting what I see around
[03:03] me is that gold can play the part so I
[03:05] have a couple of uh of people now that
[03:08] actually they fear a bit in going all in
[03:11] on bitcoin which which I fully
[03:13] understand because it there are major
[03:15] steps in between a Fed standard and
[03:18] going to a Bitcoin standard personally
[03:21] but then you see that when people say
[03:23] okay I understand the whole concept of
[03:25] of sound money of of hard money hard
[03:28] assets um just first invest something in
[03:32] gold and they see that at least that
[03:35] that stays stable and they go a little
[03:36] bit into into Bitcoin and I had several
[03:40] people now that also see the difference
[03:42] so they say Okay gold is being stable
[03:45] but actually Bitcoin is outperforming
[03:47] gold they experience themselves and that
[03:49] is for them a more comfortable way to
[03:51] say okay now I get it actually and then
[03:54] I come back saying maybe it's better if
[03:56] I go from a 90% in Gold into I don't
[04:00] know 50 50 or 90% in in Bitcoin so uh
[04:05] interesting what what is your allocation
[04:07] to bitcoin gold uh I have to say the
[04:10] gold is really small uh so you talk
[04:13] maybe about one or two percentage so
[04:15] actually I'm a Bitcoin maximalist so I'm
[04:19] uh I'm all in so to say and uh but that
[04:22] that also took uh quite some years um
[04:27] and and like I said but if you are so
[04:29] far
[04:30] that is that is what what surprised me
[04:32] actually that sometimes it can be I
[04:35] don't know yeah you talk to people on a
[04:37] daily base of course with your podcast
[04:39] but uh it's sometimes quite quite lonely
[04:42] if you if you are I mean I'm I'm living
[04:45] in a small town in in let's say the
[04:47] Rotterdam area there are not so many
[04:49] Bitcoin maximum list out here so when
[04:52] I'm walking outside with the dog are
[04:53] going to the
[04:54] supermarket uh but even with friends
[04:58] families uh
[05:00] yeah I A lot of times I feel like the
[05:02] only one so um is it is true like I
[05:08] obviously see the whole depth of the
[05:10] community I had in one year now 350
[05:13] guests on uh like it's really deep and
[05:17] PR the community but I see the people
[05:19] from all around the world uh and not
[05:22] just my local area if I just focus on my
[05:25] local area I'm in Vienna in a big city
[05:28] obviously there are some good Bitcoin
[05:30] Max is here but it's not that not not
[05:33] that many like you you really have to
[05:35] find them also on you have to go to the
[05:38] the get togethers that are happening
[05:40] once a month and and really go there and
[05:42] see what's happening uh and maybe you
[05:45] have a orange pill app or maybe you have
[05:47] other tools where you can connect with
[05:49] other bitcoiners but I agree with you
[05:51] it's we are still very early it's still
[05:54] like you're very lonely in the Bitcoin
[05:56] world and I hope it it's it gets
[05:58] different uh
[06:00] I hope it changes in in the next couple
[06:03] of years so people can feel right now
[06:06] like me because I have so many contexts
[06:08] in Bitcoin where it's like if I want to
[06:10] talk Bitcoin I I talk all the day about
[06:13] Bitcoin so actually in the evening when
[06:15] I talk with my girl when I talk with
[06:17] friends uh I enjoy not talking about
[06:19] Bitcoin also like that that's a big
[06:22] thing and other people are like they
[06:23] talking the whole day not about Bitcoin
[06:25] and they in the Fe World they really
[06:27] enjoy talking about Bitcoin in other
[06:29] time because they they had the energy in
[06:31] there so I think there's a lot of that
[06:33] also in there yeah yeah and that is like
[06:37] I said in the beginning especially
[06:38] because people I mean inflation is a
[06:41] topic so on on the typical birthdays you
[06:43] have or now with Christmas dinner a lot
[06:46] of people talk about oh yeah it's so
[06:48] expensive it's so expensive and yeah
[06:50] sometimes you want just grab these
[06:52] people say guys there's a solution out
[06:54] there you know like okay slow down like
[06:57] everyone yeah they say of course
[06:59] everyone gets the price they deserve
[07:01] that's of course a bit uh that's that's
[07:04] not the best positive way to bring but
[07:06] everyone needs his his own time and that
[07:09] is uh yeah like I said also from a
[07:12] personal part that's an interesting
[07:13] Journey but um yeah for me at the end of
[07:18] my uh of of my journey so to say I
[07:21] really now last year that's also when I
[07:23] start my my own small company in at
[07:27] least I feel so much the need to to help
[07:29] people out of course when they're open
[07:30] so I'm not like evangelist standing on
[07:33] the market and screaming around but uh
[07:37] when when I talk to people are really I
[07:40] I see there's a need for people but
[07:41] people are really yeah they're also
[07:43] afraid and uh I think that there's
[07:46] there's so much help out there and
[07:48] Bitcoin can offer so much to people uh
[07:52] and all the worries they have so yeah
[07:55] that's that's super interesting also
[07:57] interesting with the allocation because
[07:59] I was wondering even even gold bucks
[08:01] that are not into Bitcoin seem to have
[08:05] uh not of a not a big allocation the
[08:07] gold they are more like a few percent of
[08:10] the net worth in gold and not like 100%
[08:13] are there like real gold maxes out there
[08:16] that like 100% all in Bitcoin I know
[08:19] that uh even Peter shiff and other uh
[08:22] gold Maxes they have only a small
[08:24] percentage in Gold but then they have
[08:26] like gold stocks and and other things
[08:28] happening around that and their
[08:30] companies of course uh which was really
[08:33] surprising for me when I when I heard
[08:35] that yeah yeah for me that was also that
[08:38] was also an eye opener for me it was
[08:40] never really a fight between Bitcoin and
[08:43] gold I'm I'm I'm really positive into
[08:45] gold and and I understand people uh that
[08:50] that like to to invest in gold but for
[08:52] me when when I read that and people
[08:54] saying like yeah just look at people who
[08:56] have their business in Gold how much
[08:57] gold do they really have
[09:00] whether it's company wise or or private
[09:02] and it turns out nine out of 10 they
[09:04] they converted quite quickly to Cas or
[09:06] other things so that was also for me a
[09:08] big eye opener and yeah within all these
[09:11] years talking to people actually met met
[09:14] one guy who was uh who didn't had at
[09:16] that time but it's not like one one and
[09:18] a half year ago who had no Bitcoin
[09:20] allocation at the time and was fully uh
[09:24] fully in Gold uh just just personally
[09:28] but yeah that don't happen a lot no no
[09:32] interesting yeah it happens less and
[09:34] less and less do you see also the the
[09:36] move towards where Bitcoin is
[09:39] demonetizing gold obviously gold and
[09:42] Bitcoin both are rising because fat is
[09:45] just like a really bad thing uh and all
[09:49] assets that are harder than fat are
[09:51] rising but do you see the shift from uh
[09:53] gold being demonetized uh on in going
[09:56] back to the utility value and uh the is
[09:59] coming to bitcoin yeah I think with um
[10:04] it was Michael saor right who uh who
[10:06] brought it also up saying uh yeah just
[10:09] uh as a as a ID for for the US
[10:12] government to to sell the gold assets or
[10:14] for governments in in
[10:16] general um so sell the gold buy Bitcoin
[10:20] with it and um actually demonetize your
[10:23] enemies or the other countries that that
[10:25] have the gold um I think it I think it
[10:29] can go way quicker than uh than we can
[10:32] imagine right now yeah that's uh yeah I
[10:36] think it's it's it's really really
[10:39] interesting uh approach and although
[10:41] there will be always a market for gold
[10:44] um but yeah I think uh I think
[10:48] definitely Bitcoin will eat a part of
[10:50] the pie that is now belongs to Gold yeah
[10:53] and I think it will be bigger than we
[10:55] can imagine now but it's it's just
[10:57] guessing of course and like I said I'm
[10:58] not not anti- gold uh especially not I I
[11:02] like gold and and like I said what I
[11:05] notice when when I speak to people that
[11:07] I can help Golds help them a lot to
[11:11] understand the whole concept of sound
[11:12] money so but yeah that there's only one
[11:15] real sound money the absolute sound
[11:17] money and that is yeah that is Bitcoin
[11:19] that's not not the discussion yeah yeah
[11:23] I think go go is um a big part of the
[11:26] Bitcoin education uh because in in a lot
[11:30] of our senses it's the precursor to
[11:33] bitcoin we had that feat thing in
[11:36] between but uh I I think it's it's the
[11:39] precursor to to to to bitcoin and I
[11:42] think we I hope also that the history
[11:45] sees it like that when we look back in
[11:47] like 10,000 years to that area where
[11:50] like yeah like there was gold and then
[11:52] there came the digital version of gold
[11:54] which which is Bitcoin uh and that Fiat
[11:58] kind of is just there a um time in
[12:01] between like a a hybrid uh you remember
[12:05] Blu-ray yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah I
[12:08] still I I had a Blu-ray uh player yeah
[12:11] that yeah everyone was so excited about
[12:14] that thing and and it's like in the end
[12:16] of the day it was like yeah nobody used
[12:18] it because we went digital not with the
[12:21] the CDs and blues was not that big of a
[12:23] thing and that that's how I see Fiat
[12:26] currencies to a certain extent yeah
[12:28] actually I I like that comparison
[12:30] because uh like I said I I had the
[12:32] Blu-ray player for like two years and uh
[12:36] and I still remember I had a DVD it was
[12:38] uh Saving Private Ryan on uh on Blu-ray
[12:42] and and I still remember that feeling so
[12:44] bought it was the what the movie but I I
[12:46] knew the movie already and I was like
[12:48] what whatever what is the difference it
[12:51] didn't make really it was yeah like like
[12:54] what is what is the benefit of this and
[12:56] then within no time of course DVD
[12:59] was out and so yeah actually no thinking
[13:02] about it it's it's a good comparison
[13:04] yeah and uh we might look at it like
[13:07] this yeah absolutely really interesting
[13:10] also um for the argument of holding gold
[13:14] like I also hold gold but just not
[13:16] because of the financial value just
[13:18] because uh I got something from my dad
[13:22] and it's a small coin it has some
[13:24] emotional value to me and has almost I
[13:27] don't know 0.0
[13:29] whatever uh percent of my portfolio but
[13:33] it has some some value for me and I only
[13:35] hold it for emotional value
[13:38] um besides emotional value besides
[13:42] jewelry um why why are you still holding
[13:46] on to the gold like what what is like
[13:48] the the argument for you to to still
[13:51] have gold even though I know you're like
[13:54] not anti- gold but like even if like for
[13:57] example I'm very neutral to Gold so
[14:00] neutral that I just don't hold it yeah
[14:02] yeah I'm neutral to I don't know oil and
[14:06] gas I don't hold don't invest in that
[14:09] yeah you you don't have a barrel of oil
[14:11] in the backyard on the balcony yeah no
[14:14] okay yeah uh good question time for some
[14:18] uh reflection no I think for for me to
[14:20] be honest it's also sort of without
[14:22] getting too much emotional but it it is
[14:25] it's more for the for the feeling part
[14:27] so I I definitely don't see it as
[14:29] um as an investment of course I know it
[14:33] will always have some value but it's um
[14:37] yeah it's
[14:38] just I think it it would be hard for me
[14:41] to to that that that small piece that I
[14:44] have and um it's it's out there
[14:47] somewhere in in the say but I think I
[14:48] always have it just like a yeah like
[14:52] like a sort of a memory of of of my
[14:54] journey and that's that's how I see it I
[14:57] like the metal I have to say I read a
[14:59] lot about gold at the time and just yeah
[15:02] it's I have to say when you hold it when
[15:04] you hold some gold some gold or even a
[15:07] silver coin yeah it's it is it is for
[15:10] for me it's something magical especially
[15:12] at the time so that is the that is
[15:15] actually the only reason I have it not
[15:16] from an investor point I'm not checking
[15:18] the price and and take it take it that
[15:23] that serious so to say yeah I I heard
[15:25] once that uh I think like
[15:29] it was not even a Bitcoin it was just
[15:31] like a random guy that told me this and
[15:33] he's also not a gold buck uh but he has
[15:36] gold as an emergency kit yeah he has
[15:40] like an emergency kit at home and part
[15:43] of that emergency kit are small coins of
[15:47] gold where he says if something really
[15:50] bad happens no electricity like things
[15:53] really go go out of hand that he hopes
[15:58] that those gold coins represent some
[16:00] value and then he can maybe buy
[16:03] something for those gold coins uh in the
[16:06] emergency kit a lot of other things are
[16:08] also involved with that like food
[16:10] weapons and stuff like that it also
[16:11] makes sense like that but he hopes that
[16:15] this might be and that was for me the
[16:18] the best ever argument I heard for for
[16:21] holding gold where you have it in an
[16:23] emergency kit I've right now don't have
[16:26] it except of that one coin and probably
[16:28] don't get get get far with that but that
[16:33] that that seems to be for me like an a
[16:36] reasonable argument to hold some gold uh
[16:39] at at house for the monetary aspect
[16:42] obviously gold has jewelry value it's
[16:45] used in phones and stuff like that so as
[16:47] you said it will always have a value
[16:49] because it's like an tangible thing uh
[16:51] but at the same time like class also has
[16:54] value and I don't invest in class I mean
[16:56] I half class like yeah yeah yeah
[17:01] yeah that's that's the same as yeah then
[17:03] it has the same use saying some packets
[17:05] of cigarettes that's also what they
[17:07] advise people I don't smoke anymore but
[17:10] uh they say in case of an emergency it's
[17:12] also like having some gold or having
[17:14] some cigarettes it's like
[17:16] a yeah a good you you you you quit
[17:19] smoking it was it when you discovered
[17:21] Bitcoin uh yeah in in the beginning I I
[17:24] smoked a lot more but uh yeah no I was
[17:27] at at some point I was that this uh this
[17:29] Vapor uh I I went to electric smoking
[17:34] and I did that for a couple of years but
[17:36] uh yeah some point I was fed up with it
[17:38] but I can I can tell you if you quit
[17:40] with that it took me a few nights to uh
[17:43] yeah it was it it was Heavy it was more
[17:47] heavy than quit normal smoking yeah that
[17:50] that's I wouldn't advise it to uh to
[17:52] anyone what are those sorry it's not
[17:55] about Bitcoin at all but I'm just
[17:56] curious what are those electronic
[17:59] cigarettes I I saw them and I was like
[18:01] it it it seems like you you have a pen
[18:04] in the in yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly
[18:06] and uh yeah the problem is you can you
[18:09] can smoke everywhere so uh I'm here
[18:11] sitting in my home office normally when
[18:13] in the P when I was smoking normal
[18:15] cigarettes it would go outside but but
[18:17] now same as you it's at the end of the
[18:19] afternoon it's raining outside so you
[18:21] stay inside but with this thing you can
[18:23] smoke everywhere so U because there's no
[18:26] smell and there's no dirt so does they
[18:29] have the same health issues than a
[18:30] normal cigarette um so so far so good I
[18:34] would say some some say it's it's uh
[18:36] less toxic some say it's it's more toxic
[18:40] [Music]
[18:41] um bottom line is uh just uh yeah don't
[18:45] don't do it yeah don't do it don't do
[18:48] drugs don't do uh electric cigarettes
[18:50] yeah don't don't smoke guys you heard it
[18:53] here yeah save save your money and buy
[18:56] Bitcoin yeah absolutely
[18:59] um one thing that I always want to get
[19:00] into with people that are into gold uh
[19:03] or were into gold uh and also into
[19:06] Bitcoin they understand kind of both
[19:08] sense they're really on sound money uh
[19:11] how do we get because there are so many
[19:14] people that have a lot of money in Gold
[19:16] like there are a lot of people and a lot
[19:19] of rich people in in with a lot of money
[19:22] in in Gold I mean there are also central
[19:26] banks with a lot of gold they abroad
[19:29] biggest ones uh but how do we get those
[19:32] gold folks to bitcoin what you what have
[19:36] you learned in the educational journey
[19:38] of them uh that you can share that like
[19:41] okay if you get gold what is missing to
[19:44] getting Bitcoin to being actually orange
[19:47] buil yeah that's that's
[19:49] um good question I think first of all
[19:53] what what I noticed in especially in the
[19:56] last two three years when I was really
[19:57] focusing on
[19:59] getting people uh of the fifth standard
[20:02] or at least helping people when they
[20:04] were facing uh problems with with the
[20:06] living on the field standard I thought
[20:08] there were way way more people that that
[20:12] had some gold so that was my the first
[20:14] thing I noticed that actually very less
[20:17] people uh they they they don't have gold
[20:21] at all at least the the people I talk
[20:24] with so so I'm I'm talk with uh just the
[20:27] normal people that addresser the the
[20:29] plumber sales guys uh I was expecting
[20:33] more people to have
[20:35] gold um so I mean like like yeah the the
[20:40] really rich people I think that is also
[20:42] to do with age so um what I noticed and
[20:46] that's not only for gold but also for
[20:48] Real Estate I think it's the same thing
[20:51] if if people have a certain uh Age and
[20:54] and and luckily not not all people but
[20:57] uh I noticed that I have some older
[20:59] friends and um especially here uh in the
[21:04] Netherlands also in Belgium real estate
[21:06] is is quite a big thing so that is seen
[21:09] as is actually the same thing as as gold
[21:12] in the eyes I just came to the
[21:13] conclusion that that they are so stuck
[21:16] in that in the narrative that or gold uh
[21:19] or real estate is is like the holy Grill
[21:23] it it doesn't seem to to click so it's
[21:27] um
[21:29] yeah
[21:30] it's do you see some uh because you
[21:32] mentioned real estate do you see some
[21:34] overlap with Real Estate Investors also
[21:37] with the gold investors or like yeah
[21:40] like like I said especially because when
[21:43] um I have a few friends and and they're
[21:45] also a bit older and a bit more more
[21:49] wealthier um and they are really
[21:51] sticking to that that narrative what
[21:53] also thought to them like like like gold
[21:56] is sort of the standard uh uh and you
[21:59] have you have real
[22:01] estate um I I recently sold my house I
[22:04] mean in in total the whole the whole
[22:06] process it takes me like a half a year
[22:09] so you have to prepare it and you have
[22:11] to make a picture negotiate on the price
[22:13] people visiting house it's so much
[22:15] hustle to to to sell a house uh but but
[22:20] for some people it's yeah it it it's so
[22:24] difficult for them it's it's a complete
[22:25] different world and I think it just need
[22:28] to
[22:29] uh we we need more we need to uh to have
[22:32] more time I think that is absolutely
[22:35] yeah the time will educate a lot of
[22:38] people and the price will lection a lot
[22:42] of people I also think what what is in
[22:45] general um when you help people from the
[22:47] Fiat standard to the Bitcoin standard uh
[22:50] what is the importance of of sound money
[22:52] for you and and the importance of of
[22:54] having that uh the importance for me
[22:56] personally or you mean the the people
[22:58] that I talk with uh ah both both is
[23:00] interesting yeah um yeah for for me for
[23:05] me uh personally but that is like uh
[23:08] like a long journey that started in in
[23:10] 2017 like I said the first time I heard
[23:13] about the Bitcoin and at that point I
[23:15] was just looking at from a greedy
[23:18] perspective um but then at some point
[23:21] you you start to think about
[23:24] actually that was uh a few years I was
[23:28] just buying some Bitcoin and and then
[23:31] start interesting in Gold but then
[23:33] actually in in 2020 we know all with uh
[23:37] with with covid I think for a lot of
[23:39] people to really start to to think about
[23:42] people like what what's actually going
[23:44] on in the world and and then at least
[23:47] for me I'm I'm close to 40 years old
[23:49] I've never really seen inflation or at
[23:52] least not official inflation and uh when
[23:56] that started and people started worried
[23:58] ing about uh we saw the prices in the
[24:01] supermarket um we always had in the
[24:03] Netherland relatively cheap gas from my
[24:06] own gas Fields um gas prices start to to
[24:10] rise extreme levels um yeah then then
[24:14] you really start to think about uh about
[24:17] your future and like how how how can I
[24:20] how can I get the well that I have now
[24:23] how can I how can I keep it and even
[24:26] that but that is a scary part because
[24:29] you you have to admit that that if
[24:31] you're living on the Feld standard you
[24:33] have no influence on that at least that
[24:35] was my that was my conclusion and and
[24:37] that it really depends on on people
[24:41] around you that have the power and and
[24:43] if they decide to to print some money
[24:46] that it immediately affects your your
[24:48] wealth and there's nothing you can do
[24:49] about it and um so you have to face that
[24:54] reality um and then take action of
[24:56] course but that is that is that is a
[24:59] difficult part and also yeah a lonely
[25:01] part like I said sometimes it can be
[25:03] quite lonely so you have to uh you have
[25:06] to inform yourself but on the other hand
[25:08] also to be a bit stubborn and have a
[25:10] vision um like yeah how how can I take
[25:14] care of myself and and and that is also
[25:17] what I see when when I talk to
[25:19] people they have a problem but actually
[25:22] so they see like yeah I cannot buy a
[25:25] house uh like like for instance my house
[25:30] the housing pric is in the Netherlands
[25:32] it's it's like like 12 to 15% a year so
[25:36] if you have an average house in the
[25:37] Netherlands is now like
[25:39] 400,000 yeah it means it's like 1% a
[25:42] month roughly so it means that you have
[25:45] to save in the field standard €4,000
[25:47] Euro let's say
[25:49] $4,000 a month even even to and and then
[25:53] it's only to to bridge the gap between
[25:57] what what the household wor now and
[25:59] house will be worth one month later so
[26:03] yeah like I said look looking at that
[26:04] future you you feel like yeah how how am
[26:07] I going to do that and then you have to
[26:08] realize or you will realize that within
[26:11] the Fiat with just the Fiat solution
[26:14] it's not possible you can you can work
[26:15] 80 hours or 100 hours but you you never
[26:18] get there I partnered up with coin

[28:31] yeah that that's a great point with the
[28:33] house I think uh the Fiat stand up makes
[28:35] people really desperate and I recently
[28:39] made that uh the calculation of um let's
[28:43] say you have now zero savings and you
[28:46] want to get to uh a house in 10 years
[28:50] yeah and let's say you are only in the
[28:52] Fiat world like you only save in Fiat um
[28:57] if you now have a great job uh and
[29:00] you're working good in Austria uh and
[29:03] you're one of the top earners here you
[29:05] maybe get 100K uh per year but you are
[29:10] you're already earning quite good of a
[29:12] salary uh most people don't earn that in
[29:15] in Austria let's say you earn that um
[29:18] 100K you have to pay taxes on so there's
[29:20] only like really you earn like 50k from
[29:24] that uh then 50k per year you also have
[29:27] to pay things from that you have to pay
[29:30] your rent from that um there's maybe
[29:33] another 10 20,000 that goes away from
[29:35] that you have to pay food from that so
[29:37] maybe a normal person can save let's say
[29:41] 15 maybe 20,000 EUR per year yeah uh
[29:46] maybe when there are two people uh they
[29:49] can save 40,000 maybe if they're really
[29:51] good they earning both good they living
[29:53] nicely maybe they can save 50,000 Euros
[29:57] per year together yeah in 10 years a
[30:00] house what will what what would you say
[30:03] is in fear terms a house in 10 years a
[30:06] million 10 million yeah yeah in Infinity
[30:10] yeah it's it's like one of the memes it
[30:12] goes to Infinity yeah absolutely but
[30:16] even if even if even if it doesn't
[30:18] collapse let's say let's say the the the
[30:21] fat standard is really solid and doesn't
[30:24] inflate a lot and let's say a house is a
[30:26] million dollars yeah
[30:28] uh or uh and you save uh
[30:32] $50,000 a year you you can make the
[30:35] calculations uh you you need a lot of
[30:38] years to get there to those million
[30:41] dollars so that's why everyone has to do
[30:43] it with Dept and that just drives and
[30:46] and then you have Dept that you have to
[30:48] pay off uh and you're basically in a 30
[30:50] year 40 year 20 year whatever the loan
[30:53] is jail of your country of your bank it
[30:57] it
[30:58] sorry for my rant here but it's it's
[31:01] really bad yeah no but but this is
[31:05] exactly the point and on the other hand
[31:07] I'm I'm a positive guy so um I try to
[31:11] stay positive at least so this this is
[31:13] like a wake up moment for let's say the
[31:16] the the generation 20 25 that that wants
[31:19] to start a family but but it's a hard um
[31:23] it's it's hard for them to realize that
[31:25] it's almost impossible like I said I I
[31:27] saw my house um and if I see the people
[31:32] that are looking yeah it is terrible so
[31:35] at at a certain point so there was a lot
[31:36] of people that that were coming here um
[31:40] and some people made an offer but then
[31:42] you can write some notes as well and
[31:44] people saying yeah I really love the
[31:45] house but this is I get it everything
[31:47] and and but then also so it's like you
[31:50] feel a bit sad you can also say it's a
[31:52] good sales pitch but um then also if you
[31:56] look at the people who make the offers
[31:57] it's or a rich mom and dad or two
[32:02] brothers or uh two two uh to
[32:07] girlfriends uh so it was all combination
[32:10] like when it was 10 years ago or
[32:13] actually I bought this house six seven
[32:15] years ago um that was after my divorce I
[32:18] was just on on one salary at a normal
[32:20] sales job um it it was sort of to my top
[32:23] but at least I can I can sort house it's
[32:25] a simple apartment um
[32:28] but but now it it's like a no-brain even
[32:31] even let's say normal couple so just two
[32:34] people starting a family uh no it was
[32:37] not even that it was always there was or
[32:39] a father involved or some extra money or
[32:42] a combination brothers sisters friends
[32:45] so and and people said to me so had a
[32:47] nice really really nice price you get
[32:50] when you saw the house but to be honest
[32:52] still not talking about it I feel a bit
[32:55] sad for me it was hard to accept that uh
[32:57] uh the celebration from people because I
[32:59] said yeah it sounds great but it's
[33:02] actually crazy this this this should
[33:04] worry you instead of celebrating it with
[33:07] me there's not so much to celebrate from
[33:09] because yeah yeah but uh for me it's
[33:12] good because I have a house as well so
[33:14] you see I'm also profiting yeah what
[33:16] about your kids and and yeah so this is
[33:20] um for me this this this was also like
[33:23] yeah that's super interesting um what
[33:25] you say what did you say for for the
[33:28] house what you bought it for and what
[33:29] you did you sell it for what it was
[33:32] roughly doubled so it was roughly
[33:34] doubled yeah in in six years yeah six
[33:38] yeah six years and and like I said it's
[33:40] a small village outside rdam so we not
[33:43] talk about uh Rotterdam City Center it's
[33:46] just really not Prime real estate no no
[33:49] no no no no although it is in the in the
[33:51] city center but it's not a real City so
[33:53] now it's really really small it's not
[33:57] it's nothing yeah so and and just
[34:00] imagine the the doubling of if if you're
[34:03] a person that wants to save for a house
[34:06] and that like you have now zero and
[34:09] there's like uh let's say 500,000 you
[34:12] you want to save for the house but that
[34:15] thing is a moving Target in six years
[34:17] it's a million uh then it's two million
[34:20] then it's four million then it's 8
[34:21] million that that that that comes very
[34:25] quickly very unreachable uh Untouchable
[34:28] for for you yeah yeah and this is also
[34:31] what I what I uh like I said when when I
[34:34] speak to people will say okay can you
[34:36] help me out I I use this house as an
[34:38] example so roughly just to have it easy
[34:40] for the numbers um so you talk about if
[34:43] you talk about a house of 300,000 Euro
[34:45] or dollars nowadays it's more or less
[34:47] the same talk about 300,000 so if you
[34:50] have this increase that we have now 1% a
[34:53] month so the houses increases every
[34:55] month with 1% so it's 3,000
[34:58] Euro SL dollar yeah good luck I I mean
[35:02] that's only to to catch up and and that
[35:05] is also what that is what I what I how
[35:09] how I try to make it more visible to
[35:11] people when they say yeah I I I might
[35:14] need some some protection for for my we
[35:17] didn't catch that topic but pension also
[35:20] a topic like yeah how you going to nice
[35:24] uh nice GLA by the way uh so sorry yeah
[35:29] need a lot of water and uh with that it
[35:32] allows me to have long podcasts and the
[35:36] what we St yeah so but it it it makes it
[35:41] visible and and uh to people and also to
[35:44] see that with just normal saving they're
[35:46] not going together and between you and
[35:48] me and the list also not with saving in
[35:50] Gold so uh yeah that's when uh that's
[35:55] when Bitcoin comes in yeah you know this
[35:57] is you probably know it very you see it
[36:00] a lot of the times on X of course with
[36:02] the with the houses and then having the
[36:03] house price in America and US
[36:06] Dollars um and you see it of course from
[36:09] 200,000 250 to 300 and then in you also
[36:12] see it in the Bitcoin price and also use
[36:15] that um that uh that picture that
[36:18] comparison showing that if you live on
[36:21] the Bitcoin standard or at least put
[36:23] your savings in Bitcoin the price of the
[36:26] house lowers yeah so these sort of
[36:29] examples help yeah I can show you that
[36:34] uh priced in Bitcoin 21 is I think the
[36:36] best by the way we just
[36:39] 104,000 uh there it's for example United
[36:42] State media new house most of my
[36:44] audience comes from the US so let's take
[36:47] this example um that's just crazy the
[36:52] average house price crashed this month
[36:55] in Bitcoin terms 72%
[36:57] to date 83 uh and yeah 5 years it went
[37:01] down
[37:02] 91% and you can even click on it and you
[37:06] see the charts so you can say what is
[37:09] that now let's say five years uh and and
[37:13] you just see how the price develops and
[37:15] that's why we say once you adopt Bitcoin
[37:19] everything gets cheaper all the time
[37:22] exactly yeah but but yeah this this is
[37:26] really this is a
[37:28] this a nice one I will remember this one
[37:30] yeah this this makes it more uh more
[37:33] visible and and this these are the
[37:35] things that that people really need
[37:37] because like I said we and I say we
[37:41] because I can imagine a lot of your
[37:42] listeners and viewers are uh are
[37:46] bitcoiners for quite a while uh at least
[37:48] for us it's yeah we're sometimes so in
[37:51] in a bubble but uh I also I I time to
[37:55] time I I forget to realize that for a
[37:56] lot of people it's a big step to start
[37:58] somewhere because there always people
[38:00] around them as well oh oh you're going
[38:02] in Bitcoin oh
[38:03] volatility oh yeah crash it and uh isn't
[38:06] it b i I
[38:08] still yeah on Dutch television also an
[38:11] advice don't smoke and and don't don't
[38:14] watch television I some yeah that is
[38:17] that is actually after quitting with
[38:18] smoking also one of the best decisions I
[38:21] made in in the last uh three four years
[38:24] in the corona time when we were
[38:26] bombarded by all uh yeah all news uh I I
[38:32] decided to to remove the TV from the
[38:35] house best best thing ever but time to
[38:37] time you still see the clips on on X
[38:40] also from dut shows and they have like a
[38:43] guy on a on a on a sort of BBC or CNN
[38:47] like Channel and he's called the house
[38:51] Economist and still calling it the
[38:52] bubble and so it's like yeah people
[38:56] people still have that in their in their
[38:59] in their mind and uh but yeah these
[39:01] these back to back to this chart this uh
[39:04] these are the fact yeah absolutely and
[39:08] just a quick uh thing about the TV I am
[39:12] always curious when we break an
[39:14] interesting barrier and we just broke
[39:16] the 100,000 in Euros uh the dollar
[39:20] barriers broke I think like a already a
[39:22] few weeks
[39:24] behind it's quite a while actually uh
[39:26] and and now we also hit the 100,000 in
[39:29] Euros yeah and I saw the mainstream
[39:34] media so like the the biggest TV channel
[39:37] in Austria which is uh fully like you
[39:40] have to pay for that if you're an
[39:42] Austrian citizen living here yeah yeah
[39:44] we have the same crazy you you have to
[39:46] pay for that which is really really
[39:48] weird um and they reported on it just
[39:52] like I think a minute and 20 seconds or
[39:55] something like that they reported on it
[39:57] and only thing they said is the price
[40:00] and that the price went up because of
[40:02] trump yeah oh man yeah yeah that is that
[40:06] is I I I I got that who said yeah
[40:09] doesn't matter of course for but someone
[40:11] said it yeah that is that is because of
[40:13] trump right said okay this hold on give
[40:17] me give me one minute to recap and then
[40:19] then I come back to you like my my head
[40:21] is I don't know if it's exploding or
[40:23] imploding more like imploding yeah this
[40:26] but but this is the point and and and I
[40:29] think that is that is at least for me
[40:31] also always to to realize when when talk
[40:33] to people I mean I I just want to help
[40:36] people and and get them out of this it's
[40:38] it's sort of a dream they they've been
[40:41] told for years actually a lie and uh but
[40:45] yeah the fact that is really in people's
[40:47] head and uh yeah and of course you you
[40:51] know as well that how in um how in
[40:54] Europe how how people are talking about
[40:56] from so it's all negative so that
[40:58] automatically brings Bitcoin in a
[41:00] negative uh in a negative uh sphere yeah
[41:06] absolutely and it's it's just I just
[41:09] want to highlight that because I just
[41:11] realized that the house prices yeah
[41:14] almost five years ago okay or like
[41:16] exactly five years ago in January 1 we
[41:18] are very close now to January 1 um uh
[41:23] 2095 was
[41:25] 45 um I Bitcoin now we are at 4.1
[41:31] Bitcoin which is declining more than 90%
[41:35] which
[41:36] means if you hold real estate uh if you
[41:41] hold Bitcoin instead of real estate in
[41:43] the last five years you outperformed 10x
[41:47] yeah 10x over real estate which is just
[41:50] uh a crazy to think about yeah yeah that
[41:53] is that is yeah yeah that is uh yeah
[41:57] that is that is the facts I have the
[41:59] it's it's the same same ID um you also
[42:02] have one I can maybe uh send it after
[42:06] this recording maybe you could put it in
[42:09] it's it's an overview of gold and let's
[42:11] say at the start of the Euro when the
[42:13] EUR was introduced maybe you know it um
[42:16] that shows that for one uh let me see I
[42:19] I wrote it down in might have it
[42:20] somewhere Oh Yeah from at 99 at the
[42:23] start of the the Euro when the Euro coin
[42:25] was implemented in in Europe um one Euro
[42:30] could buy 120 millgram of gold and uh
[42:36] nowadays at this moment to to show the
[42:38] devaluation of the Euro as a as a
[42:41] currency it's uh close to
[42:45] 1515 milligrams of gold um so that is
[42:49] that is the first step that I use so
[42:50] then people also yeah okay I understand
[42:52] that that euro is declining but then
[42:55] secondly then comes the second chart and
[42:57] that is the chart that uh showing how
[43:00] many BTC is needed to buy one kilogram
[43:03] of gold that was doing so way way better
[43:06] than the Euro and then you also have the
[43:08] same sort of number so uh you started
[43:11] with one kilogram of gold that um you
[43:15] needed eight Bitcoin in 2020 and and now
[43:18] you only need 0.8 Bitcoin to buy one
[43:22] kilogram of gold roughly devil Say Yeah
[43:26] there I think it's even even less now
[43:29] with the with the current prices yeah
[43:32] yeah it's just a great I don't know what
[43:34] it
[43:36] what yeah and this is probably because
[43:39] you also have I was talking about
[43:41] kilograms um more used is that that is
[43:44] also typically uh European of course
[43:46] that we use so this is probably also in
[43:48] troy ounces which is more of course
[43:50] common way to uh to talk about uh gold
[43:54] but it's it's it's the same with with uh
[43:57] with the houses and uh yeah that's the
[44:01] demonetization of real estate in from
[44:03] Bitcoin and demonetization of gold to
[44:07] bitcoin like minus 94% I think it
[44:10] couldn't be clearer yeah no but this is
[44:12] point and and like I said even even for
[44:15] me uh and and this this was also one of
[44:18] the I think when I went went fully all
[44:20] in on bitcoin so to say uh so I started
[44:26] 2017 not going to lie I I think it was
[44:29] 2022 maybe even beginning 2023 so but
[44:33] but these sort of charts also for me
[44:35] first I I couldn't believe
[44:38] because cannot be the difference cannot
[44:40] be that big and um yeah and that's also
[44:44] nice thing um the more time now so we're
[44:47] going into another bull cycle um so
[44:50] there will be more data available so uh
[44:54] yeah orange choose outperformed Bitcoin
[44:57] in the last three years ah orang ju okay
[45:01] yeah yeah you see that here uh Bitcoin
[45:04] uh like orange juice went down 3%
[45:08] against Bitcoin in the day 7% in the
[45:11] week 11% on the month year to date 40%
[45:15] one year 45% 5 years 66% but the
[45:19] threeyear chart is 76% so I guess folks
[45:24] buy orange juice invest in Orange
[45:27] absolutely I'm I'm not going to drink
[45:28] that three-year-old orange du but uh
[45:31] yeah as an investment it looks good yeah
[45:35] that's one of the reare ones I think
[45:36] that's uh I think they're not so not so
[45:39] many yeah yeah if you look at the side
[45:42] so like that's the overview and there
[45:44] are uh the the Fiat currencies all going
[45:49] to zero against Bitcoin there's not a
[45:51] single time frame and not a single
[45:53] currency that is up in Bitcoin terms
[45:57] then there are precious metal all going
[45:59] to Z not a single time frame not a
[46:00] single thing uh then there's energy
[46:03] things um crude oil gas gasoline and so
[46:07] so on and then there's agriculture
[46:10] agriculture is the only thing where Eggs
[46:13] three years are up uh orange juice three
[46:17] years is up uh cacao three years is up
[46:21] oh things that I actually really love I
[46:23] like orange ju
[46:25] K yeah that's the interesting one uh at
[46:28] least it has the good color so uh but
[46:30] but those are the only three I can find
[46:32] everything else is red there is oh Tesla
[46:36] has outperformed in the past five years
[46:38] Bitcoin which is super interesting
[46:40] because I sold Tesla in in
[46:44] 2021
[46:46] uh so might have lost money on that okay
[46:51] don't look at it or maybe uh within
[46:53] within a few more months than uh yeah
[46:56] it's it's just a matter of time did it
[46:58] go all go to zero I I love that website
[47:01] a lot it's like pric in Bitcoin 21 mol.
[47:05] Space I love those websites I could be
[47:08] way too long on them yeah no but that is
[47:12] uh and um to add to that so like I said
[47:16] this is something that I used to it's
[47:18] nice because it makes it really visible
[47:21] like I said the first times I was
[47:22] looking at it I also couldn't believe it
[47:25] sometimes it it really you need to take
[47:27] some some time to digest it and like
[47:30] yeah is it is it really that true yeah
[47:31] it is that true
[47:34] um what I'm I'm going to say oh yeah
[47:37] it's the same with um this um I don't
[47:41] know how it's called but it's that Excel
[47:42] sheet that that Michael sailor just put
[47:45] out where you also can see what what an
[47:48] uh investment like a 10% allocation in
[47:50] Bitcoin or 100% allocation and what that
[47:53] will do over time and I also love that
[47:56] uh
[47:57] I I love that sheet because especially
[47:59] when you stretch it over a longer time
[48:01] it makes it so visible what is what is
[48:04] the impact of of a right uh allocation
[48:08] yeah where do you see the the the future
[48:11] of of uh gold price and bitcoin price
[48:14] both infinity
[48:16] or uh no um no for yeah okay compared of
[48:22] course to to to field like like Euro um
[48:26] yeah yeah I'm I'm not so positive about
[48:29] the Euro so yeah you could say infinity
[48:31] although I think with with gold it will
[48:33] stabilize but that has to do of course
[48:36] it it will climb but I think by far
[48:38] Bitcoin will will
[48:40] outperform uh so so for Bitcoin I really
[48:43] feel like Infinity yeah for gold um no I
[48:49] I think
[48:50] uh not especially not at the pace that
[48:53] Bitcoin uh will go so interesting no the
[48:57] price movements of Bitcoin versus gold
[49:01] is I think the most interesting to to to
[49:03] look at actually and the flippening uh
[49:07] do do you have a timeline when the
[49:08] flippening between Bitcoin and gold will
[49:11] will happen yeah yeah predictions it's
[49:13] It's Tricky um now it it is let's say it
[49:16] like this it is interesting if if you
[49:18] would have asked me three years ago
[49:20] would say it will take way way time if
[49:23] you if you're looking at the difference
[49:24] in market cap but now looking at saying
[49:27] okay bitcoin price maybe half the market
[49:30] cap of gold
[49:32] um yeah let's let's give it uh one more
[49:36] Hing uh I mean things are going so fast
[49:39] uh yeah maybe uh what other guy saying
[49:43] you're not bullish
[49:45] enough now I think this this Hing cycle
[49:48] was a bit uh it it would surprise me so
[49:50] to say but um yeah if if you see how
[49:54] fast the things are going what will
[49:56] happen with nation states Ting Bitcoin
[50:00] is a strategic Reserve then then I would
[50:03] say the next cycle we're there but I
[50:06] mean don't
[50:07] uh don't call me guys when it don't
[50:10] happen but uh yeah no like I said it's
[50:13] going so fast it's it's fascinating
[50:15] times
[50:17] yeah and and uh just for because I just
[50:21] have another side that I like uh it's
[50:23] like the ranking side oh yeah yeah yeah
[50:26] yeah I that yeah of seeing where where
[50:29] Bitcoin is progressing and it's just a
[50:31] crazy time to be alive where Bitcoin is
[50:34] still smaller than companies yeah if
[50:37] Bitcoin is still smaller than companies
[50:40] um we are early we are very early
[50:42] Bitcoin is still smaller than individual
[50:45] companies so yeah next is uh
[50:49] alphabet uh then Amazon Nvidia Microsoft
[50:53] I'm really looking forward to that one
[50:55] because Microsoft just decided not to
[50:57] buy Bitcoin yeah that was uh last week
[51:01] it was yeah yeah absolutely and they
[51:04] will they will wake up once once bco
[51:06] crosses them I think hopefully they wake
[51:09] up but I mean I actually hope that the
[51:11] the big institutions don't wake up and
[51:14] the PLS wake up before them but that's
[51:16] another story for another day yeah yeah
[51:18] that is uh that will be an interesting
[51:21] story but yeah I I hope to yeah that
[51:23] would be uh that would be nice yeah this
[51:25] is an interesting one and and especially
[51:27] yeah when when I'm looking at this one
[51:29] I'm also but that's that's another
[51:31] subject that is the msdr that is uh for
[51:33] me if if you see what uh how that is uh
[51:37] getting open and up that uh and we we
[51:40] basically have a a
[51:42] NX uh to go to Gold a little bit less
[51:46] eight point something X to to gold it's
[51:49] it's not that much it's although I I
[51:52] have to say that that gold made made a
[51:54] nice jump uh for over 2024 so they they
[51:59] also increase their their market cap so
[52:02] uh of course in in in fi terms so that
[52:06] also they they also climb but yeah the
[52:08] fastest horse in the race is is is
[52:11] Bitcoin I I remember actually when I
[52:13] first looked into Bitcoin and gold I
[52:15] think the gold market cap was like 10
[52:18] trillion or maybe even under 10
[52:20] trillion approaching the 20 trillion
[52:22] it's it's crazy for me yeah yeah it it
[52:25] goes uh but yeah of course it makes
[52:28] sense if you if you compare it to to a
[52:30] Fiat standard and to Fiat yeah I mean uh
[52:34] absolutely perfect um we flying with the
[52:37] time already at soon at one one
[52:39] hour one question that I have for each
[52:42] and every one of my guest is what can we
[52:44] learn from you besides Bitcoin
[52:49] um what can we uh what can you learn
[52:52] from me um I would say uh you're you're
[52:55] not alone
[52:57] uh
[52:57] maybe I don't know of course the
[52:59] audience that uh that that listen that
[53:03] listen to your
[53:04] podcast
[53:06] um but but yeah that is I I can at least
[53:09] imagine that that some people feel it
[53:11] sometimes that way uh
[53:14] so when when you feel some frustration
[53:16] okay let's keep it to myself what I have
[53:19] learned for myself is that you have to
[53:21] take the time when you talk to people
[53:23] when you're really enthusiastic about
[53:24] something so like Bitcoin
[53:27] and everything that comes with it um
[53:30] yeah try sometimes to take a step back
[53:33] and look at people that are really stuck
[53:35] in in in the field world and give them
[53:37] some time because I remember that uh
[53:40] when for me when it clicked it was
[53:42] really difficult and and frustrating at
[53:44] the time that yeah people are saying
[53:46] like yeah I don't care I have stocks
[53:49] they do 20% I'm fine and yeah like I
[53:52] said my my head was imploding and so I
[53:55] really uh because I I I was willing to
[53:59] help these people but yeah they didn't
[54:01] even know they had a problem so so why
[54:03] why would they ask for help and um so
[54:06] yeah that is what I uh what I learned
[54:09] and and tell all the people like take a
[54:12] step back and uh yeah that's probably
[54:17] don't judge people that is also
[54:18] something that and of course sometimes
[54:20] it's a joke but then how you know the
[54:22] phrase like uh yeah everyone deserve to
[54:25] get the price they deserve yeah of
[54:28] course it is like that but don't but
[54:30] stay stay humble and uh yeah that's at
[54:33] least what I I'm trying to do stay
[54:36] humble and stack sets folks EXA exactly
[54:40] that's the best advice that's the best
[54:42] advice perfect we have an ENT in the
[54:44] podcast where the previous guest is
[54:46] asking a question for the next guest
[54:47] without knowing who the next guest is um
[54:50] he he got to know you last episode uh
[54:55] that that was a fun uh
[54:57] in incident everyone that watched the
[55:00] last episode knows about it um perfect
[55:03] then we have to Tin uh and the previous
[55:06] guest asked a question for you when
[55:08] nation states are coming into Bitcoin
[55:12] and really coming into Bitcoin uh really
[55:16] fast what happens to the business models
[55:19] of
[55:20] exchanges uh and as as all the Bitcoin
[55:24] might be sold out
[55:26] yeah thanks thanks for the question uh
[55:29] yeah they will I was I was listening to
[55:32] to another Dutch podcast and they were
[55:34] talking about that phenomen as well
[55:37] saying like yeah what if there's no
[55:38] Bitcoin available at at the
[55:41] exchanges um yeah I I think that there
[55:44] will always be there will always be
[55:47] Bitcoin available but uh yeah at at what
[55:51] price it will definitely uh search the
[55:53] price but yeah maybe I'm not to deep
[55:56] into that but I don't foresee in the
[55:58] near future any exchanges really running
[56:01] out of uh of Bitcoin but but yeah it
[56:04] will have have a huge impact on on
[56:08] prices yeah that is
[56:11] uh absolutely for sure so if that is
[56:15] answering the question maybe not uh not
[56:17] the answer he was he was hoping for but
[56:19] I would say uh yeah I I don't worry too
[56:23] much about it I just looking forward to
[56:25] uh for nation states to adopt there will
[56:28] always be a seller in the market uh
[56:32] maybe there are no exchanges because uh
[56:34] there's nothing to exchange it with uh
[56:37] other than product and services but uh
[56:39] there uh
[56:41] there there there's always a buyer and a
[56:43] seller in the market uh at at some point
[56:47] uh if you give me enough money I I I
[56:50] might do it also yeah it's Al like a buy
[56:54] and a seller for for each and every item
[56:57] that is in in the economy that's that's
[57:00] I think really really good answer there
[57:02] really cool thank you so much G for for
[57:04] being on the show before I let you go
[57:06] where can people find you ask you
[57:07] questions and and reach out to you um

[57:16] that's the most easy um the company to
[57:19] start so the advice that the people gave
[57:21] but it's more focused on on Dutch and
[57:23] Belgian markets it's called sound money
[57:25] experts uh it's also on LinkedIn I have
[57:28] a website maybe you could put it in the
[57:30] show
[57:30] notes um yeah and that's uh I think
[57:34] that's if if people want to uh want to
[57:37] have some more information or just stay
[57:38] in contact with me it's always nice uh
[57:41] to talk with people about Bitcoin so
