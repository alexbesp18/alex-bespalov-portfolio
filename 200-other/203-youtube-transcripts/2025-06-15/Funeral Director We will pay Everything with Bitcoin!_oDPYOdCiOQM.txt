[00:00] 20 years I see a global Bitcoin standard
[00:03] I see Bitcoin acknowledged uh globally
[00:07] as money and now you realize oh wow my
[00:09] earning potential isn't keeping up with
[00:12] this sort of inflation and decrease in
[00:14] my purchasing power I don't want to have
[00:16] Bitcoin to have a bunch of money I want
[00:17] to have Bitcoin because I want to have
[00:19] time there'll be no use for Fiat in 20
[00:22] or 30 years once you feel that and you
[00:24] feel that you can really inhabit that
[00:26] true Freedom fully there's no reason to
[00:28] go back that place is a if I have enough
[00:31] Bitcoin maybe I get the premium package
[00:34] and live 500 years in 20 years a Bitcoin
[00:37] standard Bitcoin as a medium of exchange
[00:41] Bitcoin will denominate Commodities
[00:43] contracts between nation states I think
[00:46] it'll be a unit of account for products
[00:48] at a high level and probably in the
[00:50] grocery store as well it's interesting
[00:52] to me how quickly it happened it took 10
[00:55] years for every human on the planet to
[00:57] just have this on them at all times the
[00:59] five regrets of dying
[01:02] [Music]
[01:04] are how did De bring you to bitcoin sure
[01:09] so um my professional career has been as
[01:13] a owner and operator of one of the US's
[01:17] largest Crematory
[01:19] Mortuary uh locations in the country um
[01:24] I did that for about 10 years basically
[01:26] from 2013 to 2023
[01:31] and serving about 5,000 families a year
[01:35] uh I had tons of experience with uh the
[01:40] bereaved and those who are at end of
[01:43] life and where we were in the market we
[01:46] charged a lot less than other folks um
[01:49] so we got a lot of families anywhere
[01:51] from very poor to very wealthy um but I
[01:55] saw within my job a unique perspective
[01:59] on
[02:00] society which
[02:02] was how do people think at the end of
[02:05] their life and I was one of the few
[02:10] professions that actually got to
[02:13] see the regrets and pains and grief at
[02:17] the end of life especially for patients
[02:19] who were terminally ill and I had the
[02:22] opportunity to talk to a lot of people
[02:24] on their deathbed uh and with hospice
[02:27] workers so hos I don't know if they have
[02:30] where you are but hospice is a specific
[02:32] type of Medical Care reserved for the
[02:35] terminally ill so if you're on hospice
[02:38] care the main goal is comfort and
[02:40] quality of life before you pass away and
[02:42] usually people pass away on hospice
[02:44] within six
[02:46] months so you know dealing with grieving
[02:49] people and dealing with people who are
[02:51] about to die I got a lot of insight into
[02:56] kind of how people graded their own
[02:58] lives so were people happy with their
[03:01] time on Earth did they feel they spent
[03:03] it in a good way what was really
[03:06] important to them at the end and did
[03:08] they have any realizations at the end of
[03:10] their life that they wish they'd
[03:14] encountered a lot earlier in their
[03:17] life and what I found was that most
[03:21] people's biggest regret in life is
[03:25] living a life that they thought they
[03:28] should live rather than living a life
[03:31] that was more authentic to themselves
[03:33] and I saw it repeated over and over with
[03:38] my clients and it didn't really matter
[03:41] what skin color they were uh what their
[03:44] values were or whether they had money or
[03:48] not the biggest regret they have was not
[03:51] living a life that was true to
[03:53] themselves and after selling our
[03:57] business I got very interested in
[04:01] economics the Fiat system and how money
[04:05] worked and how how Capital flowed across
[04:08] the world and after learning more about
[04:11] the death-based Fiat money system and
[04:14] that bringing me to bitcoin and
[04:17] understanding bitcoin's attributes and
[04:19] how it fixed a lot of those issues I
[04:22] looked back on my professional career
[04:26] through the lens of Fiat money and
[04:29] seeing all the families that I helped
[04:31] who were grieving struggle to pay their
[04:35] bill adding Financial constraint to an
[04:39] already very emotional time I I thought
[04:43] the culprit was a lack of hard work or
[04:47] just a bad breaks and bad luck among
[04:50] this group of socioeconomically
[04:53] disadvantageous group of people but
[04:56] after understanding Bitcoin I realized
[04:58] that
[05:00] a lot of that was simply out of their
[05:02] control due to money printing robbing
[05:04] them of their purchasing power little by
[05:07] little over
[05:09] decades ultimately getting them to a
[05:11] point of near retirement and them not
[05:14] having really any money to saved or to
[05:17] spend in their retirement or to take
[05:19] care of medical bills or to take care of
[05:21] a one-time emergency of a a few thousand
[05:25] dollar so bit Bitcoin really made me
[05:28] understand how
[05:30] our society got to that point where
[05:32] people couldn't get two coins together
[05:35] to really save for
[05:37] expenses and it also taught me that the
[05:40] Fiat system was the basis for people
[05:43] living lives that they didn't want to
[05:45] live Society basically programmed them
[05:49] to plug into a corporate role as kind of
[05:53] a Mindless factory worker Without Really
[05:56] any thought behind it and that that's
[05:59] what what that's a thing that really had
[06:01] me
[06:02] disconcerted when people live their
[06:05] whole lives in a job or in a career and
[06:08] they get to the end of
[06:10] it and they really don't know why they
[06:12] started there in the first place and why
[06:15] they never pivoted and did something
[06:16] that they actually wanted to do and what
[06:20] I found was I think people are really
[06:21] scared of the unknown and they're scared
[06:25] of not having that salary that really
[06:29] kind of keeps them in that fenced in
[06:32] area and therefore they really never
[06:34] dare to dream and never G dare to go
[06:36] outside that and you see that pain of
[06:40] regret at the end of their
[06:42] life and that that's kind of how I got
[06:45] to bitcoin because Bitcoin to me is the
[06:49] best way that you buy your future and
[06:51] you buy all you buy as much of that time
[06:53] back for yourself as you can to give
[06:56] yourself as much freedom for the longest
[06:58] amount of time as you can
[07:00] on a Bitcoin standard and to me down
[07:03] when you go down the rabbit hole which
[07:05] is one way you really figure that out
[07:09] and there's no other option and there's
[07:11] no better alternative other than
[07:14] Bitcoin I love that a lot um wow there
[07:19] are so many things that I want to get
[07:21] into because first you said that like
[07:24] 5,000 families or like 5,000 deaths you
[07:27] dealt with or dealing with per year um
[07:31] also interesting um I think a lot of
[07:35] people at the end of their feared life
[07:39] they discovered that they have more
[07:42] years to live than their savings which
[07:44] is a very sad thing uh because those
[07:48] were not those were hardworking people
[07:50] that did the right thing in the Feld
[07:53] system but they never discovered that
[07:55] they got screwed over um which is a very
[07:58] sad thing to begin with um and it's like
[08:02] this this field system kind of makes you
[08:04] fearful because it keeps you in this
[08:06] this Loop and you have to get better and
[08:08] it it never gives you a brief room for
[08:10] you to discover what what what do I
[08:12] really want to do uh so it's it's
[08:14] interesting how you discovered that yeah
[08:18] it you you kind of talk a lot about the
[08:21] Matrix in the Fiat system being the
[08:23] creation of the Matrix and I really
[08:26] found true to form that most most people
[08:30] are compliant with the Matrix and it
[08:34] does cause some aggravation frustration
[08:37] and uneasiness in them but without
[08:41] Bitcoin there's there's no end in sight
[08:44] there's no light at the end of the
[08:45] tunnel there's no Prospect or game that
[08:49] you can play that can get you out of
[08:51] this Matrix everything is forcing you
[08:54] within it and and until you see Bitcoin
[08:57] or a better sound money you know you
[09:00] know nothing else and everything in the
[09:02] world that you see on a screen or in the
[09:04] news is going to keep you in that
[09:07] mindset to keep you in the system to
[09:09] keep it going do you think uh I mean
[09:11] that's uh always hard to say but do do
[09:14] you think that's kind of the design or
[09:16] is it just accidentally that that feeld
[09:18] system grew and now it's like we have
[09:19] that system and we it's it's just
[09:21] maintaining itself because it kind of
[09:24] kind of got out of out of I think that
[09:27] it's it's possible that it was designed
[09:30] um and I think if if it was we would
[09:32] never know who um and I think more
[09:37] easily uh and more obvious the incentive
[09:41] structures that have been created around
[09:44] the the system of money and
[09:48] corporatization are really good
[09:51] incentive systems paying people good
[09:54] amount of money to be in the system to
[09:56] do that job whether it's copyright
[09:59] writing or being on an Excel spreadsheet
[10:01] turning Excel files over um whatever it
[10:05] is it provides a salary so that a person
[10:08] can have a family and live a decent life
[10:11] but I also think that that goes or feeds
[10:15] into kind of the hypnosis of that
[10:18] process as well and make someone
[10:21] complacent um about their career and
[10:24] about their life
[10:26] which which I understand because if you
[10:29] if if you do have a job and it is paying
[10:30] you well and you can support a family if
[10:33] it's not broken don't fix
[10:35] it but that also leaves you open
[10:39] to times in the macro environment where
[10:42] there's a lot of money Printing and if
[10:44] you don't understand how the system
[10:47] works you see you the inflation kind of
[10:50] nabs at your heels faster then you can
[10:53] outpace it and it comes at you fast and
[10:57] that's really the only way that people's
[11:00] eyes can be opened to the issue at hand
[11:03] and that's really happened in the last
[11:05] four or five years with our generation I
[11:08] think you know with inflation up 9 10% a
[11:13] year um and over the course of four the
[11:17] last four years being up maybe 30
[11:20] 35% everything was fine until the fot
[11:23] system es escalated and accelerated into
[11:26] this time and then now you realize oh
[11:28] wow
[11:30] my earning potential isn't keeping up
[11:33] with this sort of inflation and decrease
[11:36] in my purchasing power that that's the
[11:38] kind that opens the door to
[11:41] understanding the system more and
[11:42] Bitcoin as a solution that's how it
[11:44] happened for me I we sold our business
[11:47] and I had money from the sale and while
[11:50] it wasn't you know anything like micro
[11:52] strategy I still wanted to preserve my
[11:54] cash and that's how I started down this
[11:57] Rabbit Hole um even after losing money
[12:00] on Celsius where I got burned
[12:04] I doubled down in my education on
[12:08] bitcoin and then gained a ton more
[12:11] conviction and that's where I put a lot
[12:12] of my
[12:13] money why why did you I have so many
[12:16] other questions but uh in that point
[12:18] it's I think it's really interesting um
[12:20] why did you double down like you got
[12:22] burned a lot of people when they got
[12:25] screwed over uh I also hear like in the
[12:27] early days in Austria especially around
[12:30] the 2017 time there were a lot of scams
[12:32] going on even I was uh almost in one of
[12:36] those scams um just by luck I was not in
[12:39] there um and a lot of people when they
[12:42] get into something they get screwed over
[12:44] Celsius was a ma major thing they like
[12:48] 50 other companies at the same time that
[12:49] also screwed people over FDX uh block
[12:53] fire all the other uh yeah companies
[12:56] that screwed people over how why did you
[12:59] go deeper why did you not say oh it's a
[13:01] scam I don't want to do anything with it
[13:03] I had at that time I had a pretty I had
[13:07] grown some pretty steep distrust in the
[13:13] general institutions um but specifically
[13:16] health care because I was on the front
[13:18] lines with covid with my business
[13:21] dealing with healthare and death and
[13:23] dying and the vaccines and everything
[13:25] like that being on the front lines and
[13:28] being the person that has to deal with
[13:30] the effects of covid and an abnormal
[13:35] amount of death going on around the
[13:38] world and and in America that directly
[13:40] affected my business and being told a
[13:44] narrative about that that wasn't true
[13:46] and finding out that it was deliberately
[13:49] kept
[13:51] from uh the citizens that grew a real
[13:54] spark of distrust at such a critical
[13:57] time which then kind of sparked my
[14:00] interest again in macro and geopolitical
[14:04] economy and so I said if all of these
[14:09] crypto things are failing and the media
[14:11] is telling me that it's all a scam and
[14:15] grouping Bitcoin with crypto and making
[14:18] sure that it's very clear from
[14:23] mainstream media that it's all a scam
[14:26] not to be touched not to be engaged with
[14:29] at all don't worry we're telling you the
[14:32] truth you don't need to engage with this
[14:34] entire space at all I said to myself
[14:38] I'll do my own research which is very
[14:40] common phrase in Bitcoin and you know on
[14:45] X you know do your own research whatever
[14:47] that means for you um so that's what I
[14:50] did and I had the time to do it because
[14:53] I we had sold the business and I said
[14:56] I'm going to put myself in my own
[14:58] independent didn't study and learn as
[15:02] much as I can about the Federal Reserve
[15:04] the banking system the World Bank and
[15:06] the IMF and once I did my own research I
[15:11] came to an even higher conviction of
[15:14] Bitcoin than when I first got into it
[15:16] just for a number go up so I think it
[15:19] really just stemmed from an
[15:22] overall Instinct of distrust for for the
[15:25] system and rather than get angry about
[15:28] it I just decided to read and listen to
[15:32] podcasts and found you and you know
[15:35] other YouTubers that were very even
[15:37] keeled not hyperb like there was no
[15:39] hyperbole in what you say there's no
[15:41] exaggeration or sensationalism I wanted
[15:44] to find people that just spoke the truth
[15:46] that they had discovered or people that
[15:49] want to bring you on their journey of
[15:51] discovering and I did that myself and
[15:55] that's really what led me to double down
[15:57] over time I gained conviction and then
[16:00] kept learning and as I kept
[16:02] learning I just went deeper into the
[16:04] rabbit hole and became more of a Bitcoin
[16:09] believer with every day that's that's
[16:11] really how it happened so it was gradual
[16:14] for me but it went in One
[16:16] Direction I love to hear it yeah and I
[16:19] and I think it does Something Beautiful
[16:21] with with finding people like my podcast
[16:23] with other sources with books and
[16:25] everything like because I just try to
[16:28] find the truth out about life find the
[16:31] truth out about the guest why is the
[16:33] guest thinking like he is thinking how
[16:35] is he thinking what is he thinking about
[16:38] there like the things I want to figure
[16:40] out uh and with that I learn a lot and
[16:43] it's great that people can learn Through
[16:46] My Lens and can get along my journey uh
[16:49] but like the the podcast I do all my
[16:51] life because I never want to stop
[16:53] learning from other people uh and you
[16:57] also something interesting uh with the
[16:59] Healthcare System um because you were
[17:01] also on the front lines obviously I'm in
[17:04] Austria obviously Healthcare System in
[17:05] Austria is is different than in in the
[17:08] states uh but most of my viewers
[17:11] actually in the states like 50% of my
[17:13] viewers in are in the United States um
[17:16] what's from your perspective from your
[17:19] unique view what's wrong with the
[17:20] healthcare system and do you think that
[17:24] thing that is wrong would also be wrong
[17:26] on a sound money standard it's a great
[17:28] question I think what's what's wrong
[17:30] with the health care system
[17:34] is uh the relationship between Health
[17:37] Care Providers and insurance
[17:39] companies
[17:41] and insurance is a fantastic business uh
[17:45] you basically get paid monthly for a
[17:49] promise to pay for something if it
[17:52] happens and then if that thing happens
[17:55] then they work relatively hard not to
[17:59] pay you for that thing so as a business
[18:02] it's very advantageous to large
[18:04] insurance
[18:05] companies and they've lobbied very
[18:08] successfully over the last several
[18:10] decades to make sure that they are a
[18:14] critical mechanism in the system of
[18:18] healthcare and the Machine of Health
[18:20] Care um so that they can't be extricated
[18:23] and taken out of it so I I think and and
[18:28] I'm sure that there are some insurance
[18:30] companies that are good and do right by
[18:31] customers and that's fantastic but as an
[18:34] institution overall I think it's pretty
[18:37] predatory generally um and hard to deal
[18:40] with um a lot of red tape a lot of
[18:43] paperwork and things like that so and
[18:45] there there's there's not an incentive
[18:47] system to make people healthy at the
[18:50] source of Health you know um our our
[18:54] entire medical system was developed with
[18:57] Pharmaceutical drugs and many of them
[19:01] are great however I think that there
[19:06] should be a mechanism where people can
[19:08] get cheaper drugs offered to them more
[19:11] fairly priced um as well as natural
[19:15] methods supported by the Health Care
[19:17] System uh the Health Care system in
[19:19] America is very geared towards
[19:22] prescribing you a pill as quickly as
[19:24] possible to solve whatever ailment you
[19:26] have and I don't think that that makes
[19:29] Americans healthier overall and I think
[19:32] whether that's on purpose or not I don't
[19:35] know um but it seems pretty obvious that
[19:39] that's how the Health Care system and
[19:40] medical sales and pharmaceutical sales
[19:43] are are set up is to sell pills to
[19:46] doctors who can prescribe them to
[19:48] patients I don't know if it goes away on
[19:51] a sound money standard I think that the
[19:53] incentives for insurance companies would
[19:55] certainly change on a Bitcoin standard I
[19:58] think that there would
[20:00] be an incentive to have as impactful
[20:05] medicine natural or otherwise to get a
[20:08] patient better as quickly as possible so
[20:11] that they don't have to return to the
[20:13] Health Care system with chronic illness
[20:16] um I think that would be a good outcome
[20:18] and I think it would be at least
[20:20] possible on a sound money system rather
[20:22] than kind of perpetuating as much
[20:24] illness for as many Fiat dollars as
[20:27] consistently as you can
[20:29] which seems to be the case in the
[20:31] current Healthcare System it's always
[20:32] interesting for me because when when I
[20:35] look at medicaments as an indication how
[20:37] sick
[20:38] you it's like if the less medication you
[20:43] take in a year or in 10 years in
[20:45] whatever time frame you look at um
[20:48] probably the fitter or the more healthy
[20:51] you are and I'm really really inclined
[20:53] to not take medication as long as I
[20:56] possibly can like even when when I'm at
[20:58] the doctors and I'm feeling not well
[21:02] which did not happen for a long time but
[21:05] uh when it's the case and he prescribes
[21:07] me something I'm asking him at least two
[21:10] times do I really have to take this is
[21:13] is there any other way could I wait
[21:15] another week can I just wait like few
[21:18] days maybe I don't need it maybe the
[21:20] body takes care of it like I always make
[21:23] sure
[21:24] to take the medicaments as an last exit
[21:28] Point as oh I'm I'm so bad that my body
[21:33] cannot handle it on their own because
[21:34] medications saved a lot of lives like uh
[21:37] we we should we should also cover that
[21:38] side but uh we we came to the point
[21:41] where we just like put put a Band-Aid on
[21:45] and it's okay we don't have to fight the
[21:46] symptoms you you hit your toe every day
[21:49] in the morning at the same desk keep
[21:51] hitting them buy our prescriptions for
[21:53] pain killers like that's basically our
[21:55] system yeah so
[21:59] that that that's I think something bad I
[22:01] I also have no clue if it goes away from
[22:04] the S money standard that's why I keep
[22:06] asking my guest but I think uh it will
[22:08] be at least a little bit better I feel
[22:11] like is the health insurance because you
[22:13] mentioned that optional in the states or
[22:15] do you have to get health insurance you
[22:18] you have to get health insurance in the
[22:20] US I mean there are certainly people who
[22:22] don't but with Obamacare they really
[22:27] want to um force you into a any health
[22:32] care provider that they can and if
[22:36] you don't then they will certainly
[22:38] highly suggest that you do um i' I've
[22:41] never not had health insurance medical
[22:43] bills would
[22:44] be crippling if you didn't have health
[22:47] insurance and you had any accident or
[22:50] developed a chronic illness it would B
[22:53] it would bankrupt most people if you
[22:54] don't have
[22:55] insurance all any also also not like in
[22:59] Austria I think it's actually not
[23:01] possible to not have heav I think it's
[23:04] legally just not possible but there is
[23:07] also private things but most are like
[23:09] it's it's pretty it's pretty okayish in
[23:11] Austria for my for my feelings um back
[23:16] to do your job basically what are the
[23:19] main regrets you touched on a little bit
[23:22] with the life but what are the main
[23:24] regrets that you usually heard it's a
[23:26] really nice perspective that you have
[23:28] and it's it's really nice that you have
[23:29] this this this La grieving and this last
[23:33] perspective on on on the system and on
[23:36] the people and what would you say is
[23:37] like the the main thing that you usually
[23:39] heard and uh was there something in
[23:42] there that surprised you or some some
[23:43] story that you can share with us so the
[23:47] the five regrets of dying
[23:49] are I wish I'd had the courage to live a
[23:53] life true to myself not the life others
[23:56] expected of me that's number one
[23:59] um number two I wish I hadn't worked so
[24:02] hard three I wish I'd had the courage to
[24:05] express my
[24:07] feelings four I wish I had stayed in
[24:10] touch with my friends and five I wish i'
[24:13] had been happier
[24:14] so what I what I see in those um and I
[24:18] like to for number one living a life
[24:21] true to yourself I really like to bring
[24:24] up Jack MERS the CEO of strike he talks
[24:28] a lot about you know early in his career
[24:31] not going to college like dropping out
[24:33] after a semester diving deep into
[24:35] Bitcoin because it felt authentic to him
[24:38] and look where he is now so he he's he
[24:42] talks about his time on this planet
[24:44] being finite and really understanding
[24:48] how that should shape what you do and
[24:51] the action you take professionally and
[24:53] romantically in your life and that's
[24:56] really refreshing CU as a Bitcoin
[24:58] he gets that life is not infinite we're
[25:02] not Immortal and he took the action
[25:06] young to live a life that was true to
[25:10] himself because he knew his time on
[25:12] planet Earth was finite and wanted to
[25:14] make the most of it and be as fulfilled
[25:17] as he could be during his time and I
[25:20] think you doing that as well you know
[25:22] diving deep into Bitcoin doing the
[25:25] podcast you your effort is following
[25:27] your passion very closely and that's a
[25:31] beautiful thing for human beings that
[25:34] only those who do that experience and
[25:38] you I I can I'm sure that based on your
[25:41] maybe the last six or 12 months of what
[25:43] you've been
[25:44] doing you've gained so much momentum by
[25:48] having that
[25:49] mentality that you couldn't go back to a
[25:53] different nine-to-five lifestyle working
[25:55] for someone else right and
[25:59] that is really what this regret is
[26:01] getting at it's the life that you dream
[26:04] of when you hit the pillow at night is
[26:07] actually possible for you it's that you
[26:11] don't truly believe that you can do it
[26:14] and there's so many incentives around
[26:16] you keeping you from doing it that you
[26:20] remain complacent and spend every day
[26:23] living the life that you don't want to
[26:25] live further entrenching you into the
[26:28] life that you don't want for yourself
[26:30] which is why at the end of your life
[26:32] it's such a big regret that on your
[26:35] deathbed you really understand what life
[26:37] was about and realize that you might not
[26:39] have lived as fully as you could have
[26:42] and that's
[26:44] very difficult for people to accept and
[26:47] often if they accept it at all it's not
[26:50] until very very late or too late right
[26:55] um and I find that with all these five
[26:58] regrets of dying bitcoiners tend not to
[27:01] have as big issues with these because
[27:04] they find tremendous amount of freedom
[27:06] in a Bitcoin
[27:07] standard and there's proof in in that
[27:11] purchasing power growing giving them
[27:13] more time freedom in the present
[27:16] moment to do the projects that they
[27:19] really feel are meaningful and important
[27:21] to their families their lives and the
[27:23] work that they want to do on Earth and I
[27:25] think it's interesting because um when
[27:27] we come to bitcoin when come to money um
[27:31] the biggest thing we can reclaim the
[27:33] biggest thing that we get back is time
[27:36] yes like it it it does not I I don't
[27:39] want to have Bitcoin to have a bunch of
[27:40] money I want to have Bitcoin because I
[27:42] want to have time and the five regrets
[27:45] that you talk about like spending time
[27:46] with family with friends being happy in
[27:49] life being happy is like is a thing like
[27:51] if if you do things that make you happy
[27:53] you will be happy like if you if you do
[27:55] more things of those so it all kind of
[27:57] come comes back to time also like the
[28:00] first one I wish I had the courage to
[28:01] live life true to myself that comes back
[28:04] to time if if you are in a 9 to5 uh and
[28:08] you have to work like 40 maybe 50 hours
[28:11] a week doing something that you really
[28:13] don't like yeah uh because you have to
[28:17] pay pills and then you cannot even save
[28:19] anything above that like if if you have
[28:21] to go through a season like 5 10 years
[28:24] in your life where you have to just
[28:26] grind and you get a lot of money you can
[28:27] save
[28:28] something that's maybe fun like that's
[28:30] like there are seasons in life where you
[28:32] work harder there are seasons where you
[28:33] don't work as hard like don't take this
[28:36] as an excuse to not do anything don't be
[28:39] lazy put your proof of work in there but
[28:43] um try to get to a state where you have
[28:45] the time to do what feels right for you
[28:49] and I work uh like as you brought up my
[28:53] example I was uh before employed uh and
[28:57] I loved it I liked it like I was happy
[28:59] there but once I saw the the crow on the
[29:02] other side is even Greener uh like they
[29:05] had that window in like podcasting and
[29:07] Bitcoin and this world of of amazing
[29:10] people that I can interview there was no
[29:12] going back like I started in November uh
[29:16] uh podcasting and I wasn't bloed till uh
[29:19] March but even in January I was like oh
[29:23] it's it's no question I I will do the
[29:25] other thing fulltime it was just a
[29:27] question of when do I make the switch
[29:29] because once you see the other side once
[29:31] you see the green grass on the other
[29:33] side you're like I'm not going back to
[29:35] there so so this is a this is a big
[29:38] thing I feel like and that what you what
[29:41] you felt was the pull of true freedom
[29:45] and and once you feel that and you feel
[29:49] that you can really inhabit that true
[29:51] Freedom fully you're like well I'm never
[29:54] I there's no reason to go back that
[29:56] place is a jail you know as nice as it
[29:59] is it's like a jail and the money part
[30:02] is interesting because I still do this
[30:05] day I don't earn as much as I earned
[30:07] before per month sure I'm coming closer
[30:09] and closer I'm almost there now but it
[30:14] doesn't matter like if you just like
[30:17] this the first thing like if you can pay
[30:18] your bills if you if you have enough
[30:21] money to pay your bills your life is
[30:24] fine because then you can pay your bills
[30:27] you can St stand up every day and do
[30:29] whatever you want to do and this is such
[30:32] an amazing Freedom you can go out in
[30:34] your life and go on a Tuesday morning to
[30:38] uh animals into the Sue and just enjoy
[30:41] life and then maybe instead of that you
[30:44] work on a Sunday like that that's your
[30:46] decision if what you want to do and it's
[30:48] your consequence and it's your like if
[30:51] if you do don't do anything you will not
[30:53] get money for that uh but it's your
[30:56] decision and your con like that's
[30:58] something so powerful has to do little
[31:00] to do with Bitcoin I feel like because
[31:02] even on a Bitcoin standard I feel like
[31:04] people will be in a 95 enslaved because
[31:08] they they did not uh do too much work
[31:11] but it does a lot with your brain when
[31:14] all of the sudden you can save money in
[31:16] in the
[31:17] your in in a sound money system where
[31:20] your financial energy is safe in
[31:23] there yeah really cool yeah perfect then
[31:26] uh yeah this was uh this was really cool
[31:28] I kind of got off off topic here I
[31:31] really enjoyed it uh how how was um how
[31:34] did Bitcoin would you say impacted your
[31:38] your personal life did did there
[31:39] something happened in in in your life
[31:41] that you that it impacted you Bitcoin
[31:43] specifically I think
[31:45] Bitcoin Bitcoin gave me a lot of Hope
[31:49] after after we sold the business I
[31:53] didn't have I had an identity crisis
[31:55] personally cuz all I'd ever been was a
[31:57] funeral director going in working 10
[32:00] hours a day talking to families and
[32:04] their most vulnerable days of their
[32:08] entire life and it was always an
[32:11] environment of high emotional
[32:15] volatility
[32:16] and
[32:18] that was the only thing I was used to
[32:21] that was the kind of Lifestyle I was
[32:22] used to because of my career and then
[32:25] after selling the business
[32:28] and doing my independent study on
[32:30] bitcoin and realizing all of the aspects
[32:33] of Bitcoin that allowed you to really
[32:35] preserve your purchasing power and
[32:37] therefore buy your time back I started
[32:39] easing up in life a lot more personally
[32:44] and I think it was just my mentality
[32:47] towards life changed on a Bitcoin
[32:49] standard as I accumulated Bitcoin in a
[32:53] DCA strategy I gained more confidence
[32:56] day in and day out about my future
[33:00] and I'd never experienced that with work
[33:04] making any amount of money or the only
[33:07] thing that I think that I likened it to
[33:09] was fit a personal fitness journey as
[33:12] you as I put the work in for a personal
[33:15] fitness journey I see the results in my
[33:17] body I felt that with Bitcoin as I gave
[33:20] more to bitcoin bit Bitcoin gave more to
[33:23] me in terms of philosophy and
[33:26] perspective about how life should be
[33:28] lived and I think that is that can only
[33:32] come from an understanding of sound
[33:34] money and what you can do with your life
[33:38] on a sound money
[33:40] standard and also the ability to choose
[33:42] that standard for yourself today which
[33:45] you're allowed to do but some people
[33:47] don't um or afraid to if you watch or
[33:50] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:52] I'll guess you already bought some
[33:54] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[33:57] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[34:00] in a hardware wallet my personal
[34:02] recommendation for Hardware wallet is

[35:22] with with Bitcoin you also have to side
[35:23] like Bitcoin for dummies uh which is
[35:26] fascinating name
[35:29] like not not Bitcoin for beginners but
[35:31] for dummies yeah so I you were an
[35:34] inspiration for me there so I wanted to
[35:38] kind of you know on a lot of podcasts
[35:41] the hosts and their guests always say
[35:43] like what are you doing to contribute to
[35:45] bitcoin and I've been a consumer of
[35:48] Bitcoin content for a long time gaining
[35:51] momentum gaining my own conviction and
[35:54] after hearing you and other podcasters
[35:57] talk about about what they do for the
[35:59] community by having unique conversations
[36:03] posting unique insights and Analysis and
[36:06] all those sorts of things I wanted to
[36:09] contribute myself so I started an X
[36:12] Bitcoin BTC for dummies and started
[36:15] posting there a few months ago kind of
[36:18] just breaking it down anything regarding
[36:21] information analysis quotes um tracking
[36:25] the ETFs which are really big and us now
[36:28] and I think a very big narrative as we
[36:31] continue the bull run so I just kind of
[36:34] wanted to be a source for information
[36:37] but also for myself have a journal of
[36:41] what's going on right now in Bitcoin
[36:44] because I think in three years all of
[36:48] this is really going to be valuable
[36:50] history that we'll look back on as you
[36:53] know ogs and I didn't want it to kind of
[36:57] slip out of my hands so I use my Twitter
[37:00] as something to keep track of current
[37:02] events and what's going on as we reach a
[37:05] more critical point in bitcoin's
[37:08] evolution that seems to be building up
[37:11] quite quickly in 2024 I love it what
[37:14] what I like uh what do you give think so
[37:17] so far of 2094 with Trump with Haring
[37:20] with ETFs and all the things that going
[37:22] on yeah it's crazy and even more with
[37:28] you know you you follow enough
[37:30] mainstream media and you kind of see how
[37:33] news articles will come out um about
[37:37] different people being introduced to
[37:39] bitcoin and they kind of the news
[37:42] headline comes out and you kind of
[37:44] bookmark it and then you check back
[37:47] three or four months later and then that
[37:50] person comes out as Pro Bitcoin and you
[37:53] kind of see this evolution of people
[37:57] discovering in Bitcoin and you kind of
[37:59] just put a bookmark there and then wait
[38:01] four to six months and they're
[38:04] bitcoiners and they start posting about
[38:07] Bitcoin they put laser eyes on their
[38:09] profile picture on X you know and
[38:11] it's it seems to be gaining momentum and
[38:15] it's you I just can't ignore that
[38:17] anymore and more the more and more
[38:19] prominent people especially in the US
[38:21] which I follow most closely
[38:24] are coming out as bitcoiners and they'll
[38:27] kind of give you a Hansel and gredle
[38:30] like trail of breadcrumbs of what
[38:33] they're thinking until they do a real
[38:34] announcement
[38:36] but it's just been fascinating to to be
[38:39] interested when I was and follow it as
[38:42] closely as I am and
[38:45] see how this Bitcoin fire is spreading
[38:50] and it's
[38:51] uncontainable really what what's your
[38:54] what's your long-term Vision with with
[38:55] Bitcoin when you SE out the fire and
[38:57] it's kind of starting and there's so
[38:59] many exciting news already now what's
[39:01] your long-term vision for Bitcoin where
[39:03] do you see it like in 20 years 20 20
[39:06] years I see
[39:09] a global Bitcoin standard I see
[39:13] Bitcoin
[39:15] acknowledged uh globally as money um I
[39:19] think uh Fiat will still exist alongside
[39:22] of it I think it might take longer than
[39:25] 20 years for Fiat to go away if it goes
[39:28] away at all I know there's some people a
[39:31] lot smarter than I am that say there'll
[39:34] be no use for Fiat in 20 or 30 years
[39:38] I've adopted a Bitcoin standard in
[39:40] preparation for that but I don't know
[39:41] for sure because I think that the power
[39:43] of a digital fiat currency is hard to
[39:49] overlook because there are very powerful
[39:52] institutions making sure that the Fiat
[39:56] system doesn't fall by by the wayside
[39:58] overnight and I don't want to Discount
[40:00] those forces at play but in 20 years
[40:04] certainly a Bitcoin standard Bitcoin as
[40:08] a medium of exchange I think Bitcoin
[40:11] will
[40:12] denominate Commodities contracts between
[40:15] nation states I think it'll be a unit of
[40:17] account for for products at a high level
[40:21] um and probably in the grocery store as
[40:23] well where that permeates I can't say
[40:26] for sure in 20 years but I think
[40:28] definitely the Western World and most of
[40:31] the prominent uh Eastern world as well I
[40:33] see that happening um and a general
[40:37] acknowledgement of Bitcoin as pristine
[40:40] money and pristine Capital that's really
[40:43] what I see I I often ask um 20 years
[40:46] because I'm kind of writing now on a
[40:48] feis for
[40:49] 2044 uh and it's it's interesting to see
[40:53] what can happen in 20 years I think a
[40:55] lot of people completely overestimate
[40:58] what Bitcoin will do like in the next
[40:59] one to five years but they
[41:01] completely absolutely underestimate what
[41:05] Bitcoin will do and the Bitcoin
[41:07] development will do in 20 years that
[41:10] time frame is so interesting this 20
[41:14] year like even 10 years is amazing what
[41:17] what can happen in 10 years but 20 years
[41:19] is like a lot of time uh especially with
[41:22] technology especially with Bitcoin uh
[41:25] this this will go much faster than most
[41:28] think with the Bitcoin standard with
[41:30] global adduction yeah I think so too
[41:33] your your conversation with Fred Krueger
[41:36] uh that you had I think helped validate
[41:40] a lot of my thinking on the macro scale
[41:43] for the next you know 10 or 20
[41:46] years you see
[41:49] AI blockchain technology with
[41:53] Bitcoin
[41:54] robotics Gene editing with cryst ER
[41:57] technology and and DNA manipulation all
[42:00] of those Technologies are in their
[42:03] infancy or just exiting their infancy in
[42:06] early
[42:08] stages and they're all technologies that
[42:11] Propel each other and have synergistic
[42:14] uses so when he said in your episode
[42:17] that you know we're going to be living
[42:19] in a completely sci-fi
[42:21] world I really agree with that and I I
[42:25] think Life as We Know It will change
[42:28] very drastically in the next 10 years
[42:31] and I don't see a way around it right I
[42:35] I see all of these Technologies really
[42:37] dovetailing on each other and creating a
[42:39] new
[42:40] Society that's almost unrecognizable to
[42:43] even what we have today
[42:45] and I'm interested to see how it plays
[42:48] out especially till you know the next
[42:51] five years I think you're going to be
[42:53] wild but the next 10 to 20 are going to
[42:55] be I think even more and I think Bitcoin
[42:59] is the money layer of those changes and
[43:04] will be come the base layer of the new
[43:08] world after that that transition I Julia
[43:12] also think so and it's interesting what
[43:14] implications this then has like what
[43:16] what are the consequences of having some
[43:18] money having all this great technology
[43:21] getting cheaper over time creating
[43:23] abundance in some sense do do you think
[43:26] that we we can Venture in a abundant
[43:29] system where uh people don't have to
[43:33] worry uh about future bills because
[43:37] electricity energy uh food and
[43:39] everything that we need for living is
[43:42] just so so so cheap to buy because we
[43:47] have robotics we have EI a lot of things
[43:50] that uh are just previous were done by
[43:53] humans or done done now by robots for
[43:55] example uh uh and also with Gene editing
[43:59] is also interesting do you think that we
[44:00] come to a point where we just live way
[44:02] longer like few few hundred thousand
[44:06] years a ago it was Unthinkable that we
[44:08] get like to like 80 90 100 years maybe
[44:11] we get maybe to a stage where we get 500
[44:13] years old or something like that I think
[44:16] I think it's uh I think it's possible I
[44:19] I follow Gene editing because I have
[44:24] a certain type of leukemia where when my
[44:28] DNA replicated one piece broke off and
[44:31] attached to another piece so I follow
[44:34] Gene editing very closely because they
[44:36] work with chronic illnesses like mine as
[44:40] some of the first solutions for
[44:43] crisper and I I see a world within 15
[44:47] years where I get a gene therapy and I'm
[44:50] totally cured of Leukemia and if if if I
[44:53] have enough Bitcoin maybe I get the
[44:56] premium package and live 500 years you
[45:00] know I I I see that kind of potential
[45:04] happening or even some sort of
[45:06] downloadable Consciousness happening as
[45:09] well where you know with robotics
[45:12] interfacing with your brain you may be
[45:15] able to actually harness
[45:17] Consciousness and transfer that
[45:20] Consciousness as data into different
[45:22] carbon beings that that's kind of a
[45:25] possibility in the next you know several
[45:28] decades I could see that happening that
[45:31] would be totally in line with a very
[45:33] sci-fi world
[45:34] so the gene editing I think will tackle
[45:37] chronic illness first and I think that's
[45:41] the best way to do it and then it'll
[45:44] come for you know genetically editing
[45:47] newborns for certain eye color that may
[45:50] just be kind of as simple as choosing
[45:53] what paint or stitching you want on your
[45:55] car seats I don't know
[45:57] so it it depends kind of where we get to
[46:00] and how much access the public has to
[46:03] that technology given how cheap it may
[46:05] become this is interesting I had I had
[46:08] one guest on um yeah some really
[46:12] complicated French name uh I can even
[46:16] pronounce it Sha Sha FR something like
[46:19] that um and he basically went on the
[46:22] show and he said like genan editing is
[46:26] the most most dangerous right now we can
[46:28] do to human species like full disclosure
[46:31] I have no clue
[46:34] yeah I have no clue about that uh at all
[46:38] uh but he brought some interesting
[46:39] points on like he he compared it to the
[46:42] Beast how the Beast kind of edited
[46:45] themselves to be this queen leading
[46:48] species uh and that he kind of fears
[46:52] that that could happen also with Gene
[46:54] editing by humans that there's like a
[46:56] central last Authority who has then
[46:59] control over how to edit the genes of
[47:01] all the the humans and then also with
[47:04] newborns and kind of we try we we kind
[47:07] of go towards like an uh a worker B
[47:12] thing kind of a future it's it's an
[47:15] interesting thought I have no clue like
[47:18] if it's actually can happen like that uh
[47:21] but Gene editing and transpl and and
[47:25] also like with neuralink it's also like
[47:27] goes in a similar Direction where people
[47:30] who cannot see all of a sudden can see
[47:32] again like that's amazing that's
[47:34] worthwhile innovating for yes yes it's
[47:39] it's a I think currently I don't know if
[47:41] it's good either and I I'll agree with
[47:43] you there I think that the very clear
[47:47] path for these medical
[47:49] Technologies is to make them digestible
[47:52] by helping people who need it first
[47:55] which normalized is the technology among
[47:58] the people who don't have access to
[48:01] it and then over the course of a
[48:03] generation or two it's those people's
[48:07] grandchildren who now right on the
[48:10] newborn table get edited or whatever or
[48:13] inoculated with Nanobots or something
[48:16] like that and it just is a passive
[48:19] normalization of these Technologies but
[48:22] it's hard to under it's hard to know if
[48:24] it's good for humans right if if this
[48:28] transition into kind
[48:31] of transhumanism
[48:33] where robots are human and human are
[48:37] humans are robots kind of early on I
[48:41] think we might live to see a world where
[48:43] that's the case and I think from my
[48:47] perspective someone who's only lived as
[48:50] a pure human I don't know if that's good
[48:53] for Humanity I don't know if if I see my
[48:56] grandchildren or great-grandchildren
[48:58] become cyborgs at the age of two I don't
[49:02] know if I'm going to be uneasy with that
[49:04] like like giving a current like giving a
[49:07] kid a cell phone at eight years old you
[49:09] know is that too early to give the phone
[49:11] to the child can they actually wield
[49:13] this power or is it going to hack their
[49:15] dopamine system and create problems for
[49:18] them long term with romantic
[49:20] relationships
[49:22] concentration Focus um reading the
[49:25] written word on on a page like are these
[49:28] things that are should be preserved as
[49:30] humans as a way to develop before you
[49:33] give or unleash this technology on young
[49:37] people right and how do how do you kind
[49:40] of gauge the philosophy of giving them
[49:44] these powerful tools versus withholding
[49:46] them and letting them mature before
[49:48] their use so I don't know I don't know
[49:51] the answer I don't know what's
[49:53] right cell phone is interesting because
[49:56] like we we we always kind of have it uh
[49:59] we always kind of have the the cell
[50:01] phone uh with us uh and this is then
[50:04] already kind of a a
[50:07] cybor future where you are half robot
[50:10] and half human like when earlier when
[50:14] when like before we had phones when
[50:16] there was an discussion on the table and
[50:19] we talked about like oh but that's how
[50:22] that and that's how that but now it's
[50:23] like oh we we just Google it yeah and
[50:27] even worse or even better however you
[50:30] want to see it we can just ask cgbd I
[50:33] have cgbd the premium thing on on my
[50:35] phone and when like I have some some
[50:39] weird feeling in my body I'm like hey CH
[50:42] I feel that in my body uh is that
[50:44] concerning or what can that be and it's
[50:47] like just list everything it's like
[50:48] massive it's it's it's like oh okay and
[50:52] then it's like recommending oh like just
[50:54] wait one one day and if it's still there
[50:56] like you can go to the doctor and stuff
[50:57] like that it's like um an actual good
[51:00] help or like hey uh I have those five
[51:03] things in my fridge what really
[51:05] delicious thing can I cook can you give
[51:06] me the exact recipe and how can I make
[51:09] it as healthy as possible like that's
[51:11] that's something really really cool yeah
[51:15] it is it is and I think I think we're
[51:20] we're in the beginning stages of of that
[51:23] with as humans and I think it's only
[51:26] only going to get better right and I
[51:29] think that it'll be integrated with all
[51:32] robotics as well so track uh Tesla a lot
[51:37] and and every robotics company that I
[51:40] can and kind of see how the development
[51:42] of humanoid robots is coming and they're
[51:46] still relatively primitive but compared
[51:49] to 10 years ago they're unbelievable
[51:52] like the Tesla Optimus bot has the
[51:55] dexterity to hold a shirt right it's not
[51:59] crazy to think that it could look in
[52:02] your it could be your robot in your home
[52:06] in 10 years looking in your fridge and
[52:10] chat gbt is in its head making the
[52:13] recipe and then it's making the meal for
[52:15] you I mean it it's we could we I see I
[52:20] see that as the future and I don't know
[52:22] what humans do in that future quite
[52:24] frankly I I hope I hope I hope a lot of
[52:27] creative and productive Endeavors we
[52:29] have to keep the proof of work alive and
[52:32] if we get too sedentary and too
[52:34] disengaged with how easy and pleasurable
[52:38] life is it could be the beginning of our
[52:41] end that's this funny thing like when
[52:44] when you thought about Ai and Robotics
[52:47] uh in the early days before CH GPD and
[52:51] everything came out you thought that oh
[52:54] uh I can focus on great work I can make
[52:57] music I can ride stuff uh and robots
[53:01] will do the dishes robots will do the
[53:03] laundry and now it's like no no no no AI
[53:05] is doing the creative work AI is doing
[53:07] writing the te writing the text AI is is
[53:10] doing all all the music and stuff like
[53:13] that you're doing the memes and you are
[53:15] doing the laundry and you doing it's AEL
[53:20] J it's cruel joke yeah it's hard it's
[53:24] hard it's hard
[53:27] interesting story to share because
[53:29] mentioned my phone um I had before an
[53:34] iPhone 14 pro
[53:35] Max uh that I did not need
[53:40] uh the Bitcoin standard living on
[53:44] completely Bitcoin and being
[53:47] self-employed like you really watch your
[53:49] money going out and in and you have to
[53:51] pay taxes for everything uh like if you
[53:54] are an employee the employer PID P the
[53:56] taxes for you you don't have to even
[53:58] think about it but then you have to pay
[54:00] about taxes and stuff like that and this
[54:02] all kind of came to me and I was like
[54:06] wait I have this phone that I use for
[54:10] what I use it for Twitter writing tweets
[54:13] uh and I use it yeah for nothing else
[54:17] honestly like writing on WhatsApp and
[54:19] and phoning with people I was like why
[54:21] do I have a iPhone 14 pro Max two weeks
[54:24] ago downgraded to an 11
[54:27] I I I went back I had the 11 before I
[54:31] upgraded last year to a new iPhone 14
[54:34] pro Max because I thought like ah I need
[54:35] an new iPhone what's the newest iPhone
[54:38] let's buy the newest best iPhone and and
[54:41] and a few weeks ago I was like I don't I
[54:44] don't need that I I rather sell my
[54:47] current phone get an old phone a really
[54:52] old one the only thing I put a new
[54:54] battery in there so I have no prob with
[54:56] the battery that's well Stone the
[54:58] important thing and I got Bitcoin for
[55:01] that and I'm already looking forward to
[55:05] the future calculations in like 10 years
[55:07] how much money I made downgrading to a
[55:10] phone that that phone is still too good
[55:13] for me that that phone is still too good
[55:15] to just write tweets and I just wanted
[55:18] to to get this uh this the story up has
[55:20] no um relation direct to our
[55:23] conversation but I feel like it shows it
[55:25] it shows
[55:27] what Bitcoin does with you absolutely
[55:30] you know you you you saw the Arbitrage
[55:33] in your phone to stack more sets at the
[55:36] most critical time to stack right you
[55:38] know a lot of people would say like
[55:41] these are the real last chances to stack
[55:43] as much as you can before things go go
[55:46] crazy I mean I I I took I went through I
[55:50] moved and while I when I moved I was
[55:53] looking through all my stuff and I had
[55:55] clothes that I hadn't worn in 3 years
[55:58] different different like U woodworking
[56:01] equipment that I wasn't using and I went
[56:04] through it all and I said I'm selling
[56:05] this
[56:06] stuff as much as I can because I have I
[56:10] don't need it I want more space and I'll
[56:12] take whatever money and buy
[56:14] Bitcoin for the that that seemed like
[56:17] the easiest trade in the world to me
[56:20] right I I have I think I have the same
[56:22] issue I have a I think 14 pro Max
[56:26] actually but and it's way too much phone
[56:29] way too much phone and I don't what I
[56:31] don't like
[56:33] is it's hijacked my brain right so I
[56:38] find myself during the day bringing it
[56:40] with me from room to room and I and I
[56:43] say to myself like I just leave it in
[56:45] that room I don't need why do I need to
[56:47] why do I need to touch it but my but but
[56:51] Robin my hand it's automatic it turned
[56:54] automatic right your your brain just
[56:56] grabs it unlocks it and goes to an app
[57:00] right just for that little dopamine shop
[57:03] so I'm trying now to leave it at home
[57:06] when I walk my dog leave it in a certain
[57:08] room I don't need it leave it charging
[57:10] in my bedroom while I'm out in the
[57:12] kitchen cooking and playing with my dog
[57:16] to get myself more more me time rather
[57:19] than cyborg version of me but you
[57:24] know it's very well designed to hack
[57:27] your neuro neurological
[57:30] systems it's really rare that I have it
[57:32] actually with me here I usually I don't
[57:34] have it here uh I have a specific place
[57:37] in the house it's in the hallway where I
[57:40] also charge it uh and it's like actually
[57:42] 90% of the time it's just laying
[57:45] there because I don't need it I I look
[57:48] there like oh what did someone call me
[57:53] yeah because everything else is on my
[57:54] computer anyways and I find like when
[57:57] I'm on my computer I'm not as distracted
[58:00] I'm I'm not like scrolling on Instagram
[58:03] or something like that on my phone it's
[58:06] um like nowadays I work so much that I
[58:08] don't even really have time to scroll
[58:11] like that like because I have such a
[58:13] high workload it kind of took care of
[58:15] the scrolling addiction because I just
[58:17] don't have time for scrolling these days
[58:20] yes uh and so that there proof of work
[58:23] is is a healing thing for for for any
[58:26] addiction that you have because you just
[58:28] simply don't have time for your
[58:29] addictions anymore uh so yeah but that's
[58:33] great do they have the phone just laying
[58:35] outside and the phone should be what the
[58:38] phone actually should be the phone is
[58:40] there to have um your computer with you
[58:45] when you're
[58:46] traveling that's it like if I'm out and
[58:49] about or I can quickly check messages or
[58:52] I can do things and uh sometimes it's
[58:54] good to not have your phone with you at
[58:56] all to have have this meum as you said I
[58:59] usually always have it with me to check
[59:02] check my my YouTubes and check my
[59:03] twitters it's it does not make sense but
[59:06] I have a better feeling then uh but but
[59:08] it's it's funny how how how we
[59:11] integrated with that device so so much
[59:14] but yeah that's that's really cool it's
[59:17] it's interesting to me how quickly it
[59:19] happened right it took 10 years for
[59:22] every human on the planet to just have
[59:25] this on them at all times right it's
[59:28] pretty and now think about Bitcoin
[59:30] adoption yeah actually and that's
[59:33] exactly why I
[59:35] think hyperbitcoinization is possible
[59:38] faster than a lot of people think
[59:40] because this is the infastructure for
[59:42] hyperbitcoinization
[59:44] right and it already exists and is
[59:46] proliferated throughout the world or a
[59:49] lot of the world absolutely man it's
[59:52] it's such a pleasure to talk with you uh
[59:54] really cool thank you for being on on
[59:56] the show already but we are not at the
[59:58] end routine already um one question
[60:01] before the end routine the question that
[60:03] I always ask my guest these days what
[60:05] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin I
[60:08] think that if I had advice for people it
[60:13] is you only get one life as far as you
[60:16] can
[60:17] experience do not be afraid to take the
[60:21] action that you think and feel is right
[60:24] and true to you in your life no matter
[60:27] how scared you are do it so if there's
[60:32] anyone out there who's listening and
[60:34] that resonates with them this is your
[60:37] permission to do that thing and become
[60:40] the person that you know you want to be
[60:42] I love it a lot um
[60:44] perfect we are having now the end
[60:46] routine and I think that's like we
[60:50] talked about that in the podcast already
[60:51] like that's so important uh to to be
[60:54] actually the the person you want to be
[60:57] um even though I always add in here like
[61:01] there are seasons to life like go go go
[61:04] go through hardships if if you really
[61:06] need to um I think that's that's an
[61:08] important message also but it's it's
[61:10] really important to in the long run get
[61:13] to your truest self um now the end
[61:17] routine where the previous guest is
[61:18] asking a question for the next guest do
[61:20] they special one because the the uh
[61:25] previous guest asked ask three questions
[61:27] okay uh that are all kind of
[61:29] interrelated and I want to give it to
[61:31] you one by one so one question one
[61:33] answer because it's really interesting
[61:35] also how they stack up and I'm
[61:37] interesting what you say um first
[61:39] question for you of the free Andro te
[61:41] question what does freedom mean to you
[61:43] Freedom the ability to spend my time
[61:48] which is my most precious resource in
[61:50] the ways that I deem most productive and
[61:55] ful filling and fruitful in my life it's
[61:58] beautiful second questions building on
[62:00] that do you consider yourself free I'd
[62:03] consider myself 90% there I think the
[62:07] last 10% I'm still working
[62:11] towards I I I I I am extremely grateful
[62:14] for the freedom that I
[62:16] have I think that the last bit for me
[62:20] find a way to monetize my my Bitcoin
[62:23] Journey which is a longer Road for me
[62:26] just given my current work constraints
[62:29] and time but that's my that's my last
[62:32] goal for freedom I
[62:33] needed almost one and a half years
[62:36] before the made the first Euro but I was
[62:39] not that
[62:41] um that uh serious about it in the
[62:44] beginning yeah uh but it it took me a
[62:47] long long long time but yeah it's that's
[62:49] really really cool last questions what
[62:52] steps are you taking to protect your
[62:54] freedom it's a really good question
[62:55] question living on a Bitcoin
[62:57] standard protects my freedom and I'm
[63:00] also the next within the next 5 years I
[63:04] want to have some sort of jurisdictional
[63:07] Freedom with uh International
[63:11] residency um that to
[63:14] me is a big pillar of freedom for my
[63:20] long-term future um just having lived in
[63:24] the US for the last last 10 years there
[63:27] seems to be some sort of fracturing of
[63:30] the social contract between humans and
[63:34] some lack of respect between of humanity
[63:37] between people due to ideological
[63:40] beliefs that they believe are
[63:42] incompatible with their neighbor and
[63:45] that that worries me and I'd like the
[63:49] freedom to be able to go to a place um
[63:53] that doesn't have that as a worry so my
[63:56] my next step and last step is
[63:58] jurisdictional freedom uh as much as
[64:01] possible within the next 5 years will it
[64:04] was such an honor and pleasure to talk
[64:07] with you thank you for being on before I
[64:09] let you go where can people find you
[64:11] where can people find uh your stuff you
[64:14] can find me on X at BTC for
[64:19] dummies post Bitcoin updates Bitcoin
[64:22] education interesting quotes that I
[64:23] think capture the Ze guys to bitcoin
[64:26] um ETF updates and stuff like that uh DM
[64:30] me say hello I always like to meet
[64:33] bitcoiners um trying to put as much time
[64:36] as I can into this space because it's
[64:38] just has some of the best people on
[64:41] Earth in in this industry and it
[64:44] attracts really good spirits human
[64:47] spirits and I always willing to talk to
[64:49] a bitcoiner about anything so you can
[64:52] find me there and appreciate you Rob for
[64:55] doing what you do and diving in head
[64:58] first into this you're doing a fantastic
[65:01] job for for everybody so I really
