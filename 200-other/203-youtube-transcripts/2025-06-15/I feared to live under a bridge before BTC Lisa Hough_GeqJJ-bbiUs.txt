[00:00] that's why we love Bitcoin because
[00:01] whatever our connection to bitcoin is
[00:04] it's helping us fulfill our highest
[00:06] purpose our highest use of ourselves
[00:09] Bitcoin gives us the ability to protect
[00:12] ourselves for the long term I have had
[00:14] the fear that I would be 60 and living
[00:17] under a bridge social capital is being
[00:20] known for doing what you say you're
[00:22] going to do social capital is beyond
[00:25] being trustworthy shift the focus from
[00:28] yourself and figure out how you can help
[00:30] other people right that is how you will
[00:31] succeed in the workplace it is how you
[00:34] will succeed with a partner in a family
[00:37] most parents and I'll make the sort of
[00:39] the analogy to bitcoin they're like
[00:41] Central Bankers they feel like they
[00:43] should just get involved and they should
[00:45] tweak and medle and put their influence
[00:48] into every situation you're going to
[00:49] have to figure out how to go in there
[00:51] and just accept responsibility that you
[00:53] didn't do something the kids these days
[00:56] perhaps have not grown up with all the
[00:58] Hard Knocks that my generation grew up
[01:00] with they need to have sunshine and time
[01:03] with you and Time by themselves to think
[01:05] and that's it that is all kids need to
[01:08] become resilient and individuals that
[01:11] are living a life with
[01:13] [Music]
[01:16] purpose there has been four months since
[01:18] the last time we see saw each other in
[01:20] the in the podcast and recorded um is
[01:22] what are some highlights for you in the
[01:24] last four months for you personally or
[01:26] in in in the Bitcoin
[01:27] Community well my highlight was seeing
[01:30] your podcast with Michael sailor I
[01:31] haven't watched the whole thing yet but
[01:34] I mean it's such a it's such a privilege
[01:37] to witness somebody like you who's all
[01:40] in on bitcoin who's doing the proof of
[01:42] work and who is
[01:44] succeeding so
[01:47] tell that like this is this podcast is
[01:51] number
[01:53] 167 that's
[01:55] incredible that's not for the faint of
[01:57] heart right yeah yeah it's it's like
[01:59] defitely not a passion project anymore
[02:01] it started as a passion project uh
[02:03] started it in like uh basically this
[02:05] year started it as a passion project uh
[02:07] and it became this year pretty uh
[02:09] serious pretty fast and I love it and I
[02:12] can now just stand up every day and and
[02:14] do what I love and have no Fe job left I
[02:17] just have this and I can actually pay my
[02:18] bills and this is it's it's been kind of
[02:21] amazing and and I love to to do exactly
[02:23] that and then as in bonus I can get to
[02:26] interview so many great people uh it's
[02:29] it's really
[02:30] I'm I'm I'm thankful and grateful to to
[02:32] have this
[02:33] opportunity and yeah today I want to get
[02:36] into the the topic that you had in in
[02:39] Big Block boom uh I think it was bit
[02:41] block boom I think is the conference
[02:43] called and I saw a little bit of the of
[02:46] the presentation unfortunately not all
[02:48] of that but in the beginning you said
[02:50] you have kind of a cheat code of raising
[02:52] an independent child and independent uh
[02:54] thinker and I think you have a world
[02:56] class example with Ella Ella was also on
[02:59] on my podcast already um how and and I
[03:02] we just start out with the question like
[03:04] how do we raise a independent thinker
[03:07] and not and not uh conforming child in
[03:10] like this this this world we are living
[03:12] in right now
[03:14] yeah
[03:16] um I I don't know to say this is my
[03:18] favorite topic probably isn't quite the
[03:20] right descriptor but um but I I do feel
[03:26] like I have a lot of experience um even
[03:28] though parent of one um you you know
[03:31] product uh one
[03:34] but I I
[03:37] think the kids these days perhaps have
[03:40] not grown up with all the Hard Knocks
[03:42] that not that I grew up with Hard Knocks
[03:45] but that maybe that my generation grew
[03:46] up with or my parents certainly not my
[03:50] grandparents and I really began to think
[03:54] when Ella was little like how do I make
[03:57] her resilient so that in the event that
[04:00] something happened to me or something
[04:02] happened to her dad she could go on and
[04:06] and live a life that was full and
[04:09] productive where she could totally take
[04:11] care of
[04:12] herself and so I started jotting down
[04:15] thoughts uh on a piece of paper which
[04:18] then migrated to my notes app in my
[04:21] iPhone of like things I wanted her to
[04:24] know I was really convinced that I would
[04:28] uh die before she was 5 years old I
[04:30] don't know why I used to think that but
[04:32] I was really worried that I wouldn't get
[04:35] to tell her everything I wanted to tell
[04:37] her and I wanted her to grow up to be a
[04:40] strong independent woman who could take
[04:42] care of herself so this you know guide
[04:47] if you will
[04:49] evolved but really A lot of the guide is
[04:53] helping her see the the world as a
[04:57] challenge and and understanding that
[05:00] that is the best part of the world right
[05:03] feeling like something is
[05:06] really difficult or Out Of Reach or is
[05:10] frightening to
[05:12] me is the only life worth
[05:15] living I feel like so many people
[05:18] certainly in my circle or others that I
[05:21] have met just feel like oh I could never
[05:23] move you know oh our family lives here
[05:26] or oh I could never go back to work my
[05:28] kids need me or
[05:30] whatever the reason is that people feel
[05:34] like they aren't living their best
[05:36] life uh I didn't want that for her I
[05:39] wanted her to have the permission not
[05:42] that she needed my permission but I
[05:43] wanted her to accept the challenge of
[05:46] like go do a ton of things that are
[05:49] really scary and oh and by the way while
[05:52] you're doing them you know here's some
[05:53] tips to help you along the way it's my
[05:55] opinion that most parents and I'll make
[05:58] the sort of the analogy to bitcoin
[06:00] they're like Central Bankers they feel
[06:03] like they should just get involved and
[06:04] they should tweak and medal
[06:07] and you know put their influence into
[06:11] every
[06:12] situation and in my experience it's
[06:15] better when you don't right because it
[06:19] allows your kids this struggle of okay
[06:23] how am I going to make it through the
[06:24] situation and I'm not sure if I I may
[06:27] have given this um I may told this story
[06:30] in bit black boom I can't remember but
[06:32] um you know one of the
[06:34] earliest kind of struggles for me as a
[06:37] parent to not solve her problem um was
[06:41] when she was I think maybe third grade I
[06:44] think it was third
[06:45] grade and we live in Texas but in the
[06:48] summertime we used to go to the
[06:50] Northeast to a tiny little town that no
[06:52] one has ever heard of and just do
[06:55] outside things all day right we had no
[06:58] TV there were no video games it was a
[07:02] very
[07:03] old-fashioned you wake up you walk to
[07:05] the library you may walk to the beach um
[07:09] you might walk to the tennis court you
[07:11] might just take a walk you might just
[07:13] hang out in your front yard right just
[07:16] very 1950s
[07:19] existence
[07:20] and it was wonderful and I would always
[07:24] keep Ella home from school for the first
[07:26] two weeks because I didn't want to go
[07:28] back to Houston you know for an August
[07:30] 11th start date for school it's still
[07:33] five million degrees in Houston and I
[07:36] felt like you know her having the
[07:38] ability us having the ability as a
[07:39] family to be outside
[07:42] somewhere and in nature and very very
[07:45] active was a better use of time than her
[07:48] figuring out how to line up and go to
[07:49] the bathroom and what class comes after
[07:53] lunch or you know all those things so we
[07:55] make it back to Houston she starts
[07:58] school and and she says to me oh my gosh
[08:01] I haven't finished my summer math
[08:04] homework I was supposed to do all this
[08:06] math homework and I didn't do it maybe
[08:07] it was reading I don't remember but I
[08:10] didn't do the summer
[08:11] homework and I said well why didn't you
[08:14] do it and she said well I I just I
[08:17] forgot I I just didn't do it U and she
[08:21] said can you please call the teacher and
[08:22] just tell her that I didn't have
[08:24] internet or I don't know what Ella
[08:26] really said I don't really remember but
[08:27] she wanted me to call the teacher and I
[08:30] just said I'm not calling your
[08:32] teacher you're going to have to figure
[08:34] out how to go in there and just accept
[08:38] responsibility that you didn't do
[08:40] something and I
[08:42] mean Ella is not a
[08:45] crier like ever
[08:48] probably I don't know less than five
[08:50] times in her entire life I've really
[08:52] seen her just
[08:55] boohoo and she just started crying and
[08:57] she was like begging me please call my
[08:59] teacher te I said I'm not calling your
[09:00] teacher you're going to have to go in
[09:02] and tell her why you didn't do it and
[09:03] figure out what the
[09:05] consequences so I take her to school and
[09:08] I drop her off I immediately call my mom
[09:11] and I tell my mom what's going on and my
[09:14] mom was so mad at me like how could you
[09:19] do that she's such just a precious
[09:21] little girl it's your fault she didn't
[09:24] do the homework you should have called
[09:26] the
[09:27] teacher and I just said Mom
[09:30] I I cannot like if you can't let your
[09:34] your third grader
[09:37] fail and figure out their own problem
[09:40] like you have problems right I felt like
[09:43] she's in third grade what a better time
[09:45] for her to screw up than in third grade
[09:48] when the consequence isn't
[09:50] huge so you know the moral of the story
[09:54] is most people parent like they are
[09:57] lifeguards like they're going to s save
[09:59] their kids at every juncture and I
[10:02] parented like a swim coach you know
[10:05] here's some suggestions this is how I
[10:07] was able to do this in my opinion
[10:10] efficiently right you when you swim you
[10:12] want to swim in a very efficient manner
[10:14] you don't want to put out more energy
[10:16] than is required and you want to get
[10:18] where you're going quickly so be a swim
[10:21] coach not a lifeguard that was sort of
[10:24] the moral of the story I think I think a
[10:27] bit block boom you know the other thing
[10:29] I would would say is
[10:31] that um well no sorry I'll
[10:35] pause uh the one thing that I just want
[10:37] to throw in because I'm a swimmer like I
[10:39] was actually in Nationals level in
[10:41] Austria and it's it's weird to see like
[10:44] all the swimmers that I saw there they
[10:46] were becoming really successful I don't
[10:49] know what it is about the swim sports
[10:50] but those uh because swimming in Austria
[10:52] like you have to be the top five people
[10:55] to actually live on swimming like five
[10:58] people maybe in can live from swimming
[11:00] and the rest not uh because swimming is
[11:03] not that not not that popular in Austria
[11:07] and swimming teaches you a lot like
[11:09] sports in general Spees you a lot but
[11:10] swimming is really hard because there is
[11:13] no referee that has any fault it's just
[11:17] you like you you start from uh the
[11:19] starting point and then you swim and
[11:21] it's your lane the lanes are um have a
[11:24] frame around each other so you just like
[11:27] if if you swm boo if if you did not make
[11:30] the time that you wanted to make it's
[11:32] it's 100% your fault you cannot throw it
[11:34] on any other team member you cannot
[11:36] throw it on the opponent and and there's
[11:39] something magical about swimming and and
[11:42] I did swimming all my life I think I
[11:43] started swimming I think the first my my
[11:46] mom forced me into swimming courses when
[11:48] I was like three years old something
[11:49] like that she's like you have to do some
[11:51] sports and I led it when I was like six
[11:54] seven years old but the first years like
[11:56] I was rebellious about swimming uh and
[11:59] yeah then I I got to know swimming and I
[12:01] and I L it and I was I'm still swimming
[12:03] like I'm not professional anymore but
[12:06] I'm still like going to the uh swimming
[12:09] and like go going for some from some
[12:12] lanes and uh it's it's amazing it
[12:15] teaches you a lot of self responsibility
[12:17] and and accountability that I think
[12:20] that's the that's the main thing like if
[12:21] you swam badly yeah then then you swm
[12:24] badly then you did not train enough and
[12:26] that that's a great thing uh I mean you
[12:28] Al learn a lot with team sports but
[12:30] there are like different things to it uh
[12:33] and the question that I had and I think
[12:35] this is um a really hard one um I was
[12:39] also like I'm way closer to being a
[12:42] child than to being a
[12:44] parent I'm I'm 25 so I'm I'm still close
[12:47] to to being a kid myself um but I I was
[12:52] in my civil service years that I have to
[12:55] do in Austria it's it's it's a weird
[12:57] thing but you have to have one year of
[12:59] civil service in Austria before you can
[13:01] after you can uh after you come out of
[13:03] school uh and there I was with kids uh
[13:07] the whole day and I got to know how to
[13:10] handle kids even though I was myself
[13:12] just like 20 22 years old but the kids
[13:15] were like at 12 11 10 15 around that
[13:19] time frame and it was really cool um but
[13:22] the the teachers there and the people
[13:25] that looked at after the kids were
[13:26] really relaxed because they saw a lot of
[13:28] kids and I was not like I was like oh
[13:30]  the kid is running there it will
[13:32] hurt itself and I was running behind
[13:34] again and then trying to stop it and
[13:35] it's not hurting um himself or herself
[13:39] and it's it it was really hard for me to
[13:41] like let go and and let them make the
[13:43] mistake because it was physical thing
[13:45] like it was not something oh you you get
[13:48] shuted by the teacher because you don't
[13:50] did your homework it was actually
[13:52] something physical it was like an actual
[13:53] danger for um the the physical body how
[13:57] did you uh or how do you advice to like
[14:00] make let let them make their own uh
[14:03] failures let them U put their hand on
[14:06] the heated
[14:09] oven there's a a favorite popular saying
[14:12] in Austria around that um and where do
[14:16] we have to like guide kids to a certain
[14:18] extent well so I
[14:22] think you've got to give kids power
[14:25] right a couple things um you have to
[14:29] give kids all the power for everything
[14:31] in their life that
[14:35] realistically they can have power over
[14:39] so you know I mean if if a kid is
[14:42] running around like a crazy person I
[14:44] mean during the summer I mean Ella would
[14:46] have friends over one of them would be
[14:49] you know outside trying to I don't know
[14:52] climb a tree or do something that would
[14:54] be dangerous and I would just look at
[14:55] Ella and say you know what I don't feel
[14:58] like going to the emergency room
[15:00] today like I'm just telling you right
[15:02] now that if you fall and hurt yourself
[15:06] like I don't feel like going to the
[15:08] emergency
[15:10] room that seemed to be enough for Ella I
[15:13] realized that strategy probably isn't
[15:15] enough for every kid to make them stop I
[15:17] think she took me very seriously when I
[15:20] would you know express my consternation
[15:24] maybe at what what was going on you know
[15:27] we we kind of joke today that uh the
[15:30] reason that she's a bitcoiner is because
[15:32] I made her afraid that she was not going
[15:35] to have you know any money after she
[15:37] graduated from college right we told her
[15:40] from the time she was I don't know maybe
[15:42] like six or seven or eight years old
[15:44] like we will pay for you to go to
[15:46] college but past that the day after
[15:49] graduation you're on your own so what do
[15:52] you need to be
[15:54] doing in high school that will allow you
[15:58] to get into a college that will allow
[16:00] you to get the skills degree Social
[16:04] Capital that are required for you to go
[16:07] get a job that you can then afford the
[16:10] life that you want to live again going
[16:13] back to the
[16:14] power explaining what the real world not
[16:19] consequence that isn't the right word
[16:22] but it's really hard to see into the
[16:24] future I think especially when you're
[16:26] little like you're not think Thinking
[16:29] Out wow I might live to be 90 you know
[16:32] if you're if you're 10 years old or if
[16:34] you're 15 years old and someone says to
[16:36] you you're going to be 90 how will you
[16:39] support
[16:40] yourself right there's some crazy
[16:42] statistic out there Ella shared with me
[16:44] this week that like 25% of kids her you
[16:49] know your age right in their 20s believe
[16:53] that they will inherit the wealth they
[16:55] need for their
[16:57] life right that is preposterous maybe
[17:01] it's a smaller percentage I might have
[17:03] that slightly wrong but but the idea
[17:05] that anyone in their 20s is thinking
[17:09] well someone else will take care of me I
[17:11] will inherit the money is it's sad in
[17:15] way right because it working for
[17:18] something and accomplishing something is
[17:20] all of the fun so you know you have
[17:24] these
[17:26] really I don't know honest
[17:29] um thoughtful conversations with kids
[17:32] you know if you do this this may happen
[17:37] right like you don't say don't do this
[17:41] you say well if you make this Choice
[17:43] let's talk about what will happen goes
[17:46] back to you know at bibl boom I gave
[17:49] some like here are like the top five
[17:51] things or something
[17:53] that um were that were that was my
[17:55] strategy and strategy number one was
[17:58] give kids power right give kids power
[18:01] over every decision that is absolutely
[18:03] possible so you know when you do that
[18:06] you eliminate a power struggle um and
[18:09] you allow them to mess up and you allow
[18:11] them to feel the consequences like the
[18:13] homework situation so when they're
[18:16] little right if you're in prek and they
[18:18] come home from school and you play and
[18:21] whatever do you want to take a bath do
[18:23] you want to take a shower do you want to
[18:25] make the salad do you want to set the
[18:27] table all of these
[18:29] things
[18:31] that can make them feel like a member
[18:35] you know a valuable member of your
[18:37] family um that are age
[18:40] appropriate and so you know the stakes
[18:43] the stakes get higher when Ella was I
[18:46] think in second or third grade we were
[18:47] having a birthday party she got strip
[18:49] throat took her to the doctor doctor
[18:51] said she really needs a shot to get over
[18:54] the strep throat you know if she wants
[18:56] to get over it quickly which she did
[18:58] because she was having we were having a
[18:59] birthday party in a few
[19:02] days and she doesn't like shots what kid
[19:06] does and I just said oh you don't have
[19:08] to take the shot if you don't want to
[19:09] but if you're not well by Friday we
[19:11] can't have your party and you know I
[19:14] always did a big backyard oldfashioned
[19:17] birthday party right baked cupcakes and
[19:20] we played games and we had water balloon
[19:22] flight fights and all that kind of
[19:25] stuff and the doctor was horrified that
[19:27] I would give her the choice between the
[19:29] shot or the prescription medicine the
[19:32] pill and I'm like well but why I mean
[19:35] the the benefit is to her and the
[19:37] consequence would be to her so why can't
[19:40] she have a vote I understand that she's
[19:42] in second or third grade or whatever it
[19:44] was
[19:46] um you know she went to Camp so
[19:50] month-long camp in the summer out in the
[19:53] Hill Country in Texas they fished they
[19:56] rode horses they you know do all those
[19:59] floated the river canoed um all those
[20:03] outdoor things and I said that's great
[20:06] that you want to go to camp but there's
[20:08] like 30 pages of stuff that have to be
[20:11] filled out right there's all the
[20:13] application the health forms the this
[20:15] the that like you need to go on the
[20:17] computer and print all those out and you
[20:19] need to fill them all out and then I'll
[20:20] sign them right like by now she's in
[20:23] third grade or something were they're
[20:26] 100% using computers and printing things
[20:28] out and filling out forms especially
[20:30] with basic
[20:31] information so you know all that to say
[20:34] that when it came time for Ella to do
[20:36] college applications I never had
[20:39] to ask her when a deadline was help her
[20:43] with an
[20:44] application print out a single you know
[20:48] form right she did everything because
[20:52] the benefit was to her the consequence
[20:53] was to her so your kids need power
[20:58] that's that's amazing um and I think
[21:01] that's I feel sometimes uh this is not
[21:04] even like parenting this is this is this
[21:05] goes so beyond because the the
[21:07] responsibility like the reaction of the
[21:09] doctor and the general thing that we we
[21:12] now have it's like we want to cuddle
[21:14] everyone we have to such a soft Society
[21:16] where uh we we want to protect
[21:18] everything uh but I feel like sometimes
[21:22] and and then I also saw it like I saw it
[21:24] in school I saw it even in work nobody
[21:26] wants to take responsibility like are uh
[21:29] so so many people that say like oh no
[21:31] you take you take the responsibility you
[21:34] take the blame you take everything else
[21:36] and if you are in in this world I mean
[21:38] it's a major advantage for everyone that
[21:40] wants to take responsibility like there
[21:42] are so few people that are actually
[21:43] standing up for uh whatever they're
[21:46] standing up for and so many people that
[21:49] don't want to stand up for that and when
[21:51] you want to take the responsibility and
[21:53] you're willing to to stand up for
[21:55] yourself stand up for a group of people
[21:57] stand up for a large group of people
[21:59] whatever it is um you have a major
[22:01] advantage over everyone else is is that
[22:04] um maybe to come a little bit back to
[22:06] the Bitcoin uh even though today will be
[22:09] a a Bitcoin off topic but um is that
[22:12] coming to a certain extent from a fear
[22:15] system where whenever there's something
[22:17] happening in society like covid we're
[22:19] just printing a bunch of money to fix it
[22:22] uh is is that uh like the maybe even the
[22:25] root of of of of this soft Society where
[22:28] we don't want to take responsibility if
[22:30] something happens uh let's let's search
[22:32] for a shortcut and let's the let let let
[22:35] take the Next Generation deal with it
[22:37] yeah you're probably right you said
[22:40] something really that I I wasn't aware
[22:42] of um that you had to do Civic
[22:46] service talk about that in in Austria um
[22:51] when you like only boys have to do that
[22:55] that's a weird thing like girls don't
[22:56] have to do it um military only boys in
[23:00] Austria have to go to military once
[23:03] they're done with school so be between
[23:06] school and uh uh before University you
[23:09] have to do military but at some point uh
[23:12] they're like oh we don't want to force
[23:14] everyone to go to military so they had
[23:17] an option either you do six months of
[23:20] military or nine months of civil service
[23:24] I did not wanted to go to the military I
[23:27] I did not care for it there's actually
[23:30] legal consequences if you don't go to
[23:32] the military for the six month uh it's
[23:35] really hard to get a gun for example if
[23:37] you don't go to military for the six
[23:40] months uh there are like there actual
[23:42] legal consequences to that but I did not
[23:44] wanted to do that I wanted to go to
[23:46] civil service and do something social um
[23:49] and there are some options like you can
[23:51] uh care for kids you can care for
[23:53] elderly people uh and it's it's actually
[23:56] kind of lovely I don't like like that
[23:58] the state forces you to do
[24:00] that um but the um experience you get
[24:04] from that is really cool because I was
[24:07] nine months uh it was actually in the
[24:08] covid ERA this was when I when I did it
[24:11] like no now four years ago uh when I did
[24:15] that and I was there like I was the guy
[24:18] that uh looked after kids I was the guy
[24:21] was going to um to the Elderly Homes was
[24:25] even the IT guy uh driving a car from
[24:27] that to that like I did everything in In
[24:29] Like A in that organization uh because
[24:32] they got to know like oh I know it I'm
[24:35] good with kids uh I don't uh I I I can
[24:38] joke with elderly people like they they
[24:40] saw okay he he can do everything and
[24:42] then they they throw around whever they
[24:44] wherever they need me and it was a good
[24:46] experience honestly I would not like to
[24:48] miss it even though I'm really not a fan
[24:50] of that the the state forces you to do
[24:52] something um but that one is is is quite
[24:56] okay uh and yeah that's that's in the
[24:59] Austria law and it's definitely only for
[25:01] boys girls can um voluntarily do do that
[25:06] too um and yeah there was even recently
[25:08] I think like five six years there was a
[25:11] vote if we should um uh delete this law
[25:16] if we should not have this anymore and
[25:18] the population said no we we want that
[25:20] like population said like 53% like a
[25:24] little bit minority said we want to have
[25:27] young people in the Civil Service and in
[25:29] the military uh for yeah six months or
[25:32] nine months in after school this this is
[25:35] not happening in America
[25:37] right no it's not happening in
[25:39] America and I love that they that you do
[25:43] that right because I I think the you
[25:46] know your question you know is this a
[25:48] consequence of Fiat I think what is a
[25:51] consequence of Fiat is that we are that
[25:53] we think about ourselves all the time
[25:57] right like we think about about what our
[26:00] needs are or how we are being treated or
[26:03] the things that are happening to us like
[26:07] that whole narrative is a very Fiat
[26:09] narrative and I wholly reject it
[26:13] I I I reject
[26:16] the you know that your kid has to be in
[26:19] all sorts of you know organized
[26:22] activities after school oh they've well
[26:24] they've got to be in this club or
[26:26] they've got to be in that club or they
[26:28] have to take these stem classes or they
[26:30] have to do like I I reject the notion
[26:34] that these things
[26:37] will make a productive person in society
[26:40] I think what makes a productive person
[26:42] in society is
[26:44] precisely um what you're talking about
[26:47] which
[26:48] is shift the focus from yourself and
[26:51] figure out how you can help other people
[26:54] right that is how you will
[26:55] succeed in the workplace
[26:59] it is how you will succeed with a
[27:01] partner in a family right what is it
[27:05] that you can do to contribute or to to
[27:09] lift the burden from someone else and
[27:12] that's what you've done I wish we do it
[27:14] here in America I think that we wouldn't
[27:16] go to war I I don't think that that
[27:20] folks in in the power you know the
[27:23] powers that be would vote for war if
[27:25] they knew that they had to send their
[27:28] children grandchildren
[27:31] nephews um you know in into into
[27:37] battle how how high is
[27:40] the how big is the volunteer work in in
[27:43] America because in Austria we have
[27:46] really a lot of volunteer volunteer work
[27:50] for example the fire department has an
[27:53] professional fire department but also an
[27:55] separate Volunteer Fire Department which
[27:58] is really big in Austria like the
[28:00] culture of like almost everyone in
[28:04] Austria not everyone like a huge portion
[28:07] of society in Austria has something like
[28:11] they in in in uh the fire department
[28:13] also on on the side just to help out
[28:16] here uh some I have some some English
[28:18] words are not in my mind but uh some
[28:21] suar B this is there like there are a
[28:23] lot of uh um things where we can help
[28:26] each other out and it's actually quite a
[28:29] a high percentage of of uh people that
[28:32] do those kind of things for fire
[28:33] department especially is
[28:35] really an a popular one uh and I don't
[28:40] know if if this comes from this like uh
[28:42] Olden Austrian economics F and and this
[28:45] like it would be interesting to to deep
[28:47] a little deep dig a little bit deeper in
[28:50] the in history and and see where it's
[28:52] coming from but it's it's is that also
[28:54] in America a big thing where we uh work
[28:58] at the Fire Department volunteer work in
[29:01] in
[29:02] uh I forgot that word
[29:05] sorry Robin not that I know of I I think
[29:09] that it's I can just say from my own
[29:12] experience um it's very difficult to
[29:15] volunteer places right there are
[29:18] organizations that you can join that
[29:20] then have relationships with um other
[29:24] organizations where you can go volunteer
[29:26] but I um I'm not aware I think that's
[29:30] amazing volunteer fire department I mean
[29:33] that's that's real work theoretically
[29:36] right you're not just pushing a cart
[29:38] down a hallway of
[29:40] a place
[29:42] or um no I don't know that again like I
[29:47] think if we were if if we lived in a
[29:49] world more focused on service we'd be
[29:51] living in a different world thank you
[29:53] you already made it halfway through the
[29:55] video and I'm really really grateful to
[29:57] have you here two things make this
[29:59] channel possible you as a watcher and
[30:01] listener who keep supporting this
[30:03] Channel and another one is all the
[30:06] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[30:08] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[30:10] very start and where I personally buy my
[30:12] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[30:14] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[30:16] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[30:20] simplest and securest way to secure your
[30:23] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[30:25] only 2% of bitcoiners hold the Bitcoin
[30:28] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[30:30] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[30:34] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[30:36] and you know your friend does not have
[30:38] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[30:40] he needs a birthday present and a small
[30:42] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[30:44] 5% off your order plus you support my
[30:48] channel and now let's get back to the
[30:50] video absolutely yeah um maybe coming a
[30:53] little bit back to the uh topic uh that
[30:57] for for me was also something big like
[30:59] my I was not allowed to have any uh
[31:03] digital computers or digital things uh
[31:06] more than half an hour till I was like
[31:08] 14 years old like pretty old uh now like
[31:11] 12 years old have like all the data the
[31:13] phone and stuff like that but I was
[31:14] always like like no you don't have your
[31:17] phone till uh like I did not had I don't
[31:20] know when did I get a phone I don't know
[31:21] 123 something like that uh but I only
[31:24] had like half an hour of of digital work
[31:27] per day day there like PlayStation or TV
[31:31] like any things of that but only half an
[31:33] hour um until 16 I had like only one
[31:37] hour this kind of incentivized me or
[31:40] forced me to be a lot in nature and I
[31:44] had a farm next to me where my uncle was
[31:46] and I was I think yeah till like 15 16
[31:49] years old like every day there I was
[31:51] helping out in the farm I was helping
[31:52] out there and I did always a lot in in
[31:54] in nature and uh I think that's one
[31:57] reason why I'm I'm barely sick these
[31:59] days because I got a lot of outside work
[32:02] um is and you also mentioned before with
[32:04] Ella where you are outside and and did
[32:06] that stuff um how important do you think
[32:09] is is that being being in nature and
[32:11] being outside and and I also see it with
[32:13] bitcoiners nowadays when when I talk
[32:15] with them they're like touch grass this
[32:17] is like a big meme also in the Bitcoin
[32:19] Community being outside doing something
[32:22] how how important is that for like kids
[32:25] well I think it's important for
[32:26] everybody I
[32:29] didn't my perception was that a phone
[32:32] would never be a good idea for Ella she
[32:35] didn't get one until she was in eighth
[32:37] grade uh and the only reason she did is
[32:40] because she made the varsity golf team
[32:42] and they traveled and I wanted her to be
[32:44] able to call me if she needed me but we
[32:47] gave her like one of those old flip
[32:50] phones so she didn't even have really
[32:53] the ability to text obviously she went
[32:55] away to boarding school as a freshman in
[32:58] high school so she did take a phone with
[32:59] her but
[33:01] it we we didn't have technology in the
[33:04] summertime when we would go away there
[33:06] was no technology
[33:09] zero no
[33:12] televisions no computer time no cell
[33:17] phone like it was a no technology summer
[33:21] and you didn't miss it at all right none
[33:24] of our neighbors were technology people
[33:26] like the entire Community where we lived
[33:30] was free of Technology it just is not a
[33:33] thing but I didn't realize until really
[33:37] I mean so uh from like 2017 until 20
[33:42] early 2021 I lived um on a tiny little
[33:46] island in the on the East
[33:48] Coast uh very 1950 6070s whatever the
[33:53] decade is that you want to say it was
[33:55] like um you know very Outdoors Z focused
[34:00] Community
[34:02] oriented kind of a blue collar Place
[34:06] really um it did a lot of service people
[34:09] that worked on houses in Newport Rhode
[34:11] Island um lived where I lived I spent
[34:14] most of my days outside working in the
[34:16] garden hauling dirt remediating soil
[34:20] planting
[34:22] bulbs um pulling weeds cutting grass
[34:25] planting trees
[34:28] it was marvelous I was
[34:30] so happy and I didn't really realize
[34:34] until you know kind of I don't know the
[34:35] last six or eight months looking around
[34:37] Houston going God there's like something
[34:40] missing like I don't feel as well as I
[34:42] felt four years ago and it's not a
[34:45] health
[34:47] related and it's not necessarily a
[34:51] mental health related but there's
[34:54] something missing and I and I started to
[34:56] like go okay what am I doing differently
[34:58] you know what it is I'm never outside in
[35:01] Houston it's so hot here I'm rarely
[35:05] outside I'm never outside for the for
[35:08] being outside right I may leave my I
[35:11] live in a highrise leave my building get
[35:13] in my car drive somewhere go
[35:15] inside I spend zero time touching grass
[35:20] like there that is a thing like that
[35:24] there is a 100% con connection between
[35:29] the energy in your body and the amount
[35:31] of time that you spend outside so I am
[35:34] figuring out how to get out of Houston
[35:36] or how to how to
[35:38] find the ability to spend more time in
[35:41] nature because I think it's really
[35:43] important and I think that
[35:45] it's um it affects us I at a cellular
[35:49] level it's like we have to have it it's
[35:52] an ingredient in a diet that we have to
[35:55] have yeah I think uh um getting sunlight
[35:59] and getting crass in your like I love
[36:02] the feeling of barefoot crass it's it's
[36:06] something uh pretty spectacular I love
[36:08] it a lot um you also brought up the
[36:12] topic of social capital and I heard it
[36:15] from you and I heard it from some some
[36:16] other people um how do you define social
[36:20] capital because I feel like there really
[36:22] important and maybe that's that
[36:26] bitcoiners are like once they figure out
[36:28] Capital with Bitcoin they go ahead and
[36:30] then they learn a lot they do a lot they
[36:32] learn a lot for the Social Capital and I
[36:34] feel like even the social capital is
[36:36] probably way more important than the
[36:38] actual Capital that you have because
[36:40] with Social Capital you can get the
[36:41] other Capital back how do you define the
[36:44] the social capital and and and and how
[36:46] do you build it social capital is being
[36:49] known for
[36:51] doing what you say you're going to do
[36:54] social capital is it's it's beyond being
[36:58] trustworthy there's a there's a TED Talk
[37:00] I would recommend that that you watch or
[37:02] your audience watches um I saw it in in
[37:06] 2013 I think 2013 maybe 2015 it's by a
[37:10] woman named Meg
[37:12] J and it is about why it's titled why 30
[37:18] is not the new 20 and it talks about how
[37:22] 20s somethings are really struggling to
[37:24] find their purpose and they think that
[37:26] it's okay to do to to uh you know taking
[37:31] on serious stuff until their
[37:35] 30s you know I'll get a serious job when
[37:38] I'm 30 I'll go into a serious
[37:40] relationship when I'm 30 I'll start
[37:43] thinking about where I really want to
[37:44] live when I'm 30 I'll look for life's
[37:46] meaning when I'm 30 I wholly reject
[37:50] that right the time your time is
[37:54] precious and from a monetary standpoint
[37:57] mean the difference everyone's heard
[37:58] this but the difference between starting
[38:00] to save at 15 versus 25 right if you if
[38:06] you put money into a tax preferred
[38:09] retirement account beginning at 15
[38:12] versus beginning at 25 like it's a
[38:15] profound difference you know I felt like
[38:20] it was a
[38:21] must that Ella work when she turned
[38:24] 15 um again we were you know spend
[38:27] summers in this tinyy little place and
[38:30] there really was no industry other than
[38:33] you know kind of a bakery in a coffee
[38:35] shop and an ice cream shop and um and
[38:38] there were a lot of kids there and a lot
[38:40] of the kids there worked and the only
[38:42] job she could get was kind of the late
[38:45] shift at the ice cream place where she
[38:48] worked I don't know from maybe like 6 or
[38:51] 7:00 at night until midnight and she was
[38:55] the new kid and so she had to mop the
[38:57] floor and you know kind of do all the
[39:00] things that she would come home and her
[39:01] tennis shoes would just reak they would
[39:03] smell so bad because she you know
[39:07] mopping and cleaning and um her shoes
[39:10] would get wet and it was just
[39:12] like but she loved that job she loved
[39:16] making her own money and she loved at
[39:18] the end of the summer being able to fund
[39:20] you know a small portion but some of her
[39:24] U retirement savings account because she
[39:26] had built a spreadsheet
[39:28] because we weren't you know she knew
[39:30] that when she graduated from college
[39:32] there would be no stipend from her
[39:35] parents right so she she had long before
[39:39] she got this job she sat down and
[39:41] figured out okay um you know if I do
[39:46] this what you know how will this pan out
[39:49] financially at what what age can I
[39:52] retire how much money do I really need
[39:53] to live my whole life like there isn't
[39:56] anyone listening to the show Robin that
[39:58] can't figure these things out right that
[40:00] is like simple math on an Excel
[40:04] spreadsheet maybe you're using you you
[40:06] are using a compound compounding
[40:08] calculator to make some of these
[40:11] estimates but like why isn't why aren't
[40:14] kids when they're 13 or 14 thinking
[40:16] about these things right because when
[40:19] you are then you know why at 15 which is
[40:23] the earliest that she could get a job um
[40:26] legally
[40:28] you know why it's a must that you get a
[40:31] job starting at age 15 you realize the
[40:34] impact this will have on your life but
[40:37] you know if parents feel like their kids
[40:39] don't need jobs and their kids deserve
[40:41] the summer off and oh my kids work so
[40:43] hard during the year you really put them
[40:46] at a
[40:47] disadvantage you put them in a place
[40:49] where they feel like well now I'm 25 and
[40:52] I can't go scoop ice cream like that's
[40:55] beneath me or I can't go do whatever job
[40:58] that's beneath me but I would say if you
[41:01] are
[41:03] 25 and you're not Robin S who's killing
[41:06] it making 167 podcasts and working 24
[41:10] hours a day like if you're looking for
[41:12] what your purpose is just go start
[41:15] somewhere go take a job and show up
[41:17] every day and do a great job and be the
[41:20] person that's dependable that reputation
[41:23] really follows you and you know
[41:27] I love saying that I started working
[41:32] when I was 14 years old I mean I did
[41:34] take years off when Ella was
[41:36] little but like you know as a
[41:41] middle-aged person I love looking back
[41:43] and going you know I've been working
[41:44] since I was 14 and this is honestly a
[41:48] privilege from God that we get to work
[41:52] right working isn't a burden we are
[41:55] meant to do something we are put here to
[41:57] to be good humans and to be of service
[41:59] to others and
[42:01] to fulfill our highest purpose and I
[42:05] think so many of us in
[42:07] Bitcoin that's that's why we love
[42:09] Bitcoin because
[42:11] whatever our connection to bitcoin is
[42:15] it's helping us fulfill our highest
[42:18] purpose our highest use of ourself and
[42:21] you get to help others um while also you
[42:26] know as Peter McCormack says becoming uh
[42:30] magically rich with this magic internet
[42:32] money so it's a total
[42:36] win I
[42:38] say it's not you know I don't think any
[42:42] I think at this point we are not sitting
[42:45] on
[42:46] podcasts uh for the numbero up
[42:49] technology we we are here realizing as
[42:52] you pointed out earlier that the decay
[42:54] of
[42:55] society is
[42:58] because of the decay of the value system
[43:01] because of the decay of
[43:03] Fiat Etc and it's it's starting early
[43:07] this compounding effect is amazing
[43:09] because with money you see it so great
[43:12] because you like can actually track it
[43:14] and you can track the numbers and
[43:15] everything you can get a nice graph in
[43:18] but I think what is even better when you
[43:22] have actual um when we work on this
[43:24] social capital and when we're going out
[43:27] out we're working we're doing something
[43:28] we're networking we we're putting some
[43:30] work in whatever the the work is in the
[43:33] end of the day we're getting experience
[43:36] and I'm just 25 but I started also my
[43:40] first work when I was 16 17 years old uh
[43:44] and the last job I had that I quitted uh
[43:47] I think three four months ago I was six
[43:50] years there I started there as a
[43:51] software tester who is just clicking uh
[43:54] buttons to try to break a software uh
[43:57] that's basically a job of a software
[43:59] dester I went ahead and went to software
[44:02] development manag service and I had my
[44:04] own clients that had a huge amounts of
[44:08] of revenue for the for the company I was
[44:10] sitting right next to the CEO I was
[44:12] getting giving a lot of responsibilities
[44:15] but I was one of the youngest I think
[44:17] there's only one guy that was younger
[44:18] there had a company there than me and we
[44:20] were like 25 people or something like
[44:21] that uh that's only because I always
[44:25] search for responsibility like always
[44:27] wanted to have more like I I said uh in
[44:30] the first internship I made there uh to
[44:33] to the CEO there I want to have I want
[44:35] to work with you in sales I want to have
[44:37] U um clients of my
[44:40] own I did not even how I didn't even
[44:42] know how to code uh and I wanted to have
[44:46] but I made it from the beginning clear
[44:48] that I want to have responsibility and
[44:50] then I went ahead on did like three
[44:51] years of software testing software
[44:53] development I I learned my way into the
[44:56] company because because when you are 18
[44:58] you have no clue about working at least
[45:00] I did not
[45:01] had I think most don't have uh and so
[45:04] like I had six years of experience uh
[45:08] and I see it now with with with my
[45:10] girlfriend and she's she's amazing she's
[45:12] also now working uh but she did not work
[45:15] a lot till now like she's now starting
[45:17] out she's in the same age and she
[45:19] started a lot and the the the things
[45:22] that she's now starting to to learn when
[45:24] she's working I learned when I I was 18
[45:27] years old there just some things that
[45:30] you cannot learn in University there are
[45:32] things that you really have to learn
[45:33] when you're in the work when you're
[45:36] actually working within a team when
[45:38] you're working when there's money
[45:40] involved with other people like that you
[45:42] actually have to have a deadline
[45:44] otherwise there's like something on the
[45:46] line because in in school it's like okay
[45:49] you there's a deadline yeah you teacher
[45:52] might not be happy but there's no no
[45:54] real world consequence to that that's
[45:57] just like yo TJ is not happy but if you
[45:59] screw up something in the company
[46:01] there's actually some real world
[46:02] consequences to that uh that you realiz
[46:05] so like I I gain a lot of like I think
[46:08] the money part was secondary to me um
[46:11] because I was uh lucky that I grew up in
[46:15] a very uh well protected family and and
[46:19] I always felt like secure with money
[46:21] even though I was on my own since 18 19
[46:24] years old because I had to because my my
[46:26] parents had a similar uh mindset than
[46:29] you that like okay once he started
[46:31] working once he finished his school he
[46:33] he can now live live off his own uh
[46:36] thing and I think that's very valuable
[46:38] like getting the knowledge and the
[46:40] social capital building this social
[46:42] capital really early on of course like
[46:44] the the money part is also great if you
[46:46] can build it really early on but the
[46:48] social capital that this accumulates so
[46:50] fast and you you you you have so many
[46:53] great experiences then and then and yeah
[46:55] it's I have question here but this is
[46:58] wanted to just share and uh uh give you
[47:02] as input yeah I love that I what was
[47:05] your girlfriend doing before why was she
[47:07] not
[47:08] working I mean she was working uh she's
[47:11] coming she has a uh she she's coming
[47:14] from India uh so she made her way from
[47:17] India to here uh in India she has very
[47:21] protected uh parents uh but now she's on
[47:25] her own she she wanted to actually break
[47:27] out of this uh being well protected from
[47:29] the parents like in Indian parents are
[47:32] like what I know from from her and her
[47:34] parents are even really good from that
[47:37] but outside of that like they they're
[47:38] really especially when they girls really
[47:41] protected of her like it's it's a whole
[47:43] another level than we have in America
[47:45] than we have in uh in in Austria or in
[47:48] the western civilization it's it's a
[47:50] whole another level I yeah I I learned a
[47:53] lot about
[47:54] culture already uh and and and now she's
[47:58] she's doing that yeah uh but it's it's
[48:01] uh definitely a parents thing yeah it's
[48:03] uh uh that um yeah perfect then uh I had
[48:09] some some more things I I want to like
[48:11] okay yeah the one question that I I had
[48:13] done homeschooling that I really want to
[48:16] get into you because we we're coming
[48:18] closer to the end um I think uh Ella
[48:21] said like no to homeschooling I think we
[48:23] talked about that even in the last
[48:25] podcast uh um what's what's your take
[48:28] now on homeschooling because I think
[48:30] homeschooling is really cool but there's
[48:32] like this social thing where then your
[48:35] kid is not like it's in it's your home
[48:37] and you have like she has to care or the
[48:41] kid on has on himself has to care for
[48:44] his social structur like when you're in
[48:46] a school you get to know friends and uh
[48:49] then when you're homeschooling um you
[48:52] have only the Social Circle around you
[48:55] and you have to like go in neighborhood
[48:57] and find friends on your own
[48:59] um do you see like homeschooling as like
[49:02] the more more the future where
[49:05] we collect or organize ourselves in in
[49:08] in smaller areas and and less in the
[49:10] schools yeah well there a couple things
[49:13] I don't know um probably not I don't
[49:17] think that in and I and I would say
[49:19] everything that I've said is strictly an
[49:21] American perspective I fully understand
[49:24] um what you were saying about your the
[49:27] the family dynamic in which your
[49:29] girlfriend grew up in um so my my
[49:32] perspective is obviously only
[49:34] American but if our entire world is
[49:37] falling apart and if inflation continues
[49:40] and if money becomes less
[49:43] valuable that pushes
[49:46] people into more stressful places into
[49:50] more work into more jobs so who's
[49:54] homeschooling these kids right you have
[49:57] to have a certain level of financial
[49:58] stability in able to be in order to be
[50:02] able to homeschool your children
[50:03] somebody has
[50:05] to be the one homeschooling the kids
[50:09] unless um I have some good friends who
[50:12] had five kids and um and I think there
[50:16] were maybe four families that got
[50:18] together with all of the kids and took
[50:20] turns um teaching those kids and and all
[50:23] of those kids were homeschooled I think
[50:26] um through High
[50:27] School amazing kids they got into
[50:30] amazing colleges but I I mean I see that
[50:33] as being rare right it's a it's a
[50:35] privilege to be able to homeschool your
[50:37] kids because it means that you have some
[50:39] level of financial safety I don't think
[50:41] that the um perception maybe that
[50:46] homeschool is less of
[50:49] anything is just uneducated I have a
[50:53] really um a dear friend who who was
[50:57] actually my public speaking coach so an
[51:00] incredible public speaker uh public
[51:03] speaking coach she had a couple of
[51:05] award-winning podcasts um on public
[51:09] speaking and she had twin girls who she
[51:13] had
[51:13] homeschooled their whole
[51:16] lives and they were just a couple of
[51:19] years younger than Ella and I remember
[51:21] she called one day and said you know the
[51:24] girls are really interested in speaking
[51:26] to Ella about boarding school they know
[51:28] that she's had this great experience in
[51:30] boarding school um but you know I I so
[51:33] they'd like to speak to Ella but I'm
[51:35] really worried because I don't think
[51:36] they'll get into a boarding school
[51:38] because they've been homeschooled and I
[51:40] said to her I you know first of all
[51:43] there's boarding schools for all kinds
[51:45] of kids so you know I think what we have
[51:48] in our mind at least in America is this
[51:51] um you know very like that the academic
[51:55] rigor is is um that academics are you
[51:59] know very structured and and difficult
[52:02] and um but there's there tons of
[52:06] boarding schools all over the world that
[52:09] that serve different needs of different
[52:11] kids and so I was explaining this to
[52:14] her so her kids get on a call with Ella
[52:17] and maybe another call maybe another
[52:19] call and they decide to make application
[52:22] to some boarding schools well Robin the
[52:25] number one boarding school in the United
[52:27] States is
[52:28] Andover George Bush went there you can
[52:30] Google it it's got an incredible
[52:33] reputation both of her daughters got
[52:37] full scholarships to
[52:39] Andover and they went right now this is
[52:42] a mom who said to me I don't think that
[52:44] my girls will ever get in because you
[52:47] know they were homeschooled as though
[52:49] like homeschooling somehow implies that
[52:52] it's less rigorous than a regular school
[52:56] I think if we really consider what goes
[52:58] on in a regular school like I mentioned
[53:00] earlier there's a lot of time just
[53:02] standing in line and figuring out what
[53:04] class to go to next and line up to go to
[53:06] recess and line up to go to lunch
[53:09] and you know just all the garbage sort
[53:13] of discipline that they do and the
[53:16] it's I don't know I begged Ella to home
[53:20] be homeschooled um and she just she was
[53:24] happy at her school and um
[53:27] and it was fine I guess but at the end
[53:31] of the day she was my child and so I I
[53:33] would say that to parents it's like
[53:35] they're your kids you don't need to take
[53:38] them to an after school activity every
[53:41] day they don't have to be on you know
[53:43] team sports if they don't want to like
[53:46] they need to have sunshine and time with
[53:49] you and Time by themselves to think and
[53:52] that's it that that is all kids need to
[53:57] become
[53:58] resilient and and individuals that are
[54:02] living a life with
[54:04] purpose and when you fill their lives
[54:06] with all of these different
[54:10] activities you're basically
[54:12] saying you have to stay busy in order to
[54:15] live a life of purpose which I wholly
[54:17] reject I think that having time to think
[54:21] is what has brought all of us into
[54:23] Bitcoin right if we had all been in a
[54:27] swim at a swim meet or in a at a soccer
[54:31] match
[54:33] or in
[54:35] something we wouldn't have spent
[54:37] hundreds of hours on this topic that we
[54:39] hold so dear so kids belong to parents
[54:43] and they belong to
[54:45] families and spending time with them is
[54:49] is more impactful than anything else
[54:51] that you'll do and which you know again
[54:53] like is the reason why I would send Ella
[54:55] back to school to weeks late every
[54:57] single year maybe three weeks late some
[55:00] years um I would often pick her up in
[55:02] the middle of the day there was
[55:06] um yeah I mean there was a week a year
[55:09] that I would literally drop her off for
[55:11] two hours in the morning and then there
[55:12] was an event that happened in Houston
[55:14] there was a tennis tournament that
[55:15] happened in Houston and we were tennis
[55:18] fans and we would go camp out in the
[55:19] stands and watch this these great tennis
[55:23] players come through Houston once a year
[55:25] I mean like she'd go to School two hours
[55:26] a day and then you know we'd stay at the
[55:29] tennis thing until it ended at 9:00 at
[55:31] night like they're yours right she's
[55:35] mine I wanted to spend time with her um
[55:39] before the you know go ahead and I think
[55:43] this is a really uh good point because
[55:46] uh a lot of parents like you have to be
[55:48] in school you have to play by the rules
[55:49] you have to be on time and I think uh
[55:51] this really teaches a kid when you take
[55:55] her out or bring her little later that
[55:57] you don't always have to play exactly
[56:00] better rules you can like you can make
[56:03] your own judgment call you can make your
[56:05] own decisions it's it's it's still your
[56:07] life even if you are in a system that
[56:10] maybe doesn't want to because probably
[56:12] most of the kids in in her skill I don't
[56:14] know how it is in America but in Austria
[56:17] it is like that and most of the kids in
[56:19] school they were brought in at time and
[56:22] they they were the whole time here and I
[56:24] was also like that weird kid in school
[56:27] especially to the end where I could sign
[56:29] my my own things and I don't didn't have
[56:31] to go to my mom for that I was there
[56:34] like half the time if it comes high but
[56:36] I was one of the best in in the class
[56:38] because I just was a quick learner but I
[56:40] was not there a lot and and and teachers
[56:42] were like oh you have to come and and
[56:44] you have to come but there were also the
[56:46] the few teachers that said like oh you
[56:49] don't have like you're obviously a good
[56:51] uh student you're doing your homework
[56:53] you're doing your projects you're doing
[56:55] everything fine like this was an age
[56:57] above 15 to 18 this was this this time R
[57:00] and they're like ah okay if if you're
[57:02] not here it's fine like you obviously
[57:05] learn something here in school you're
[57:07] doing your things why should you like
[57:10] you're not here to sit in school you're
[57:12] here to learn something and I think this
[57:14] gets sometimes a little lost and like no
[57:16] no you have to sit in school you have to
[57:18] obey the rules exactly you're not here
[57:20] to learn you're here to sit and I like
[57:23] that a lot bringing the the kid a little
[57:25] later in school and picking her up in
[57:27] the middle of the day it's it's I think
[57:29] it teaches her uh on a very subconscious
[57:34] level extremely something important to
[57:37] to set your own rules and set your own
[57:39] decisions well I don't I but why do we
[57:42] think that school if we don't go to
[57:44] school why do we think that that's
[57:45] breaking the rules right like they're
[57:48] not in
[57:50] prison they're not in a Work
[57:53] Camp I mean they're they're there to
[57:57] learn right we're teaching them how to
[57:59] be a productive human being right we're
[58:03] giving them skills so that they can go
[58:06] out and have interesting conversations
[58:08] and hopefully solve really hard problems
[58:11] because we have a lot of them I just I
[58:14] just reject the we're breaking rules
[58:18] when we don't send our kids to school
[58:21] from X hour to Y hour every day like we
[58:24] can't continue to think that way and
[58:28] expect different results yeah
[58:30] full-heartedly agree with that and I
[58:32] think this around the one hour mark also
[58:34] now it's a it's a great way uh to end
[58:37] this podcast this was one of the
[58:38] podcasts where I try a little bit of off
[58:42] topic of Bitcoin like usually I'm I'm
[58:44] only on bitcoin but I I try to get like
[58:47] some off topics in and I even start soon
[58:51] uh a Bitcoin business hour where like
[58:53] once a week or uh or maybe every second
[58:56] week I get someone in and we only talk
[58:58] about how to scale something how to do
[59:00] something I want to get more things out
[59:02] of out of Bitcoin also in in the podcast
[59:05] and I think this was a very important
[59:07] topic uh let's see how how the community
[59:09] reacts to it let's see how people like
[59:11] it uh thank you Lisa for for doing that
[59:15] uh with me and and and bringing
[59:16] something new to the table um before we
[59:19] get uh off we have an end routine in the
[59:22] podcast as you know where the previous
[59:24] guest is asking a question for next
[59:26] guest this is again a Bitcoin question
[59:29] uh from the previous guest and the
[59:31] previous guest asked you uh what is your
[59:34] goal with Bitcoin why are you stacking
[59:38] um well I you know I said this on the
[59:40] breed love podcast
[59:43] I have had the fear that um I would be
[59:47] 60 and living under a
[59:50] bridge right and I I feel like Bitcoin
[59:54] gives us
[59:56] the ability to protect ourselves for the
[59:59] long
[60:00] term it's it doesn't require that you
[60:05] have gone to school and sat through
[60:07] classes and and followed those rules it
[60:10] doesn't require that you have become a
[60:13] financial engineer it doesn't require
[60:15] that you
[60:16] are um you know you have all these
[60:19] letters after your name it doesn't
[60:21] require any of
[60:23] that it is just the safety net so that I
[60:28] for me it's the safety nets frankly so
[60:31] that I can just go live my life and go
[60:34] work in a garden and remediate dirt and
[60:37] plant dalu bulbs and think about things
[60:40] I want to think about and read
[60:41] interesting books and talk to
[60:42] interesting
[60:44] people right it's it's like my ticket to
[60:47] be able to do that I don't want to spend
[60:51] my time watching CNBC or talking to a
[60:54] financial adviser about
[60:57] whether or not we beat the index by 1%
[60:59] or 2% I don't find any of that use of
[61:02] time productive or
[61:04] engaging right like Bitcoin just lets
[61:07] you shed all of the preconceived
[61:10] notion again that you must follow this
[61:14] prescribed path so that's why I stack I
[61:17] love that a lot um perfect then before I
[61:20] let you go where can people uh find you
[61:22] where can people reach out to you if
