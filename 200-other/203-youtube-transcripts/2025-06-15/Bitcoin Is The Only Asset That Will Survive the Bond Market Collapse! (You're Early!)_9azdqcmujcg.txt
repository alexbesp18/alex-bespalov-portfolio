[00:00] I think that a lot of people still of
[00:02] course in the investment world they see
[00:03] Bitcoin as a risk on asset and I think
[00:05] that 50 years from now that's going to
[00:07] be absolutely laughable. The Bitcoiners
[00:09] that work in his administration are
[00:11] passing legislation right now that is
[00:14] super bullish. I mean everything that's
[00:16] coming out, the SEC is dropping cases
[00:18] left and right. And it's been said many
[00:20] times that nobody really understands
[00:22] Bitcoin fully because nothing like this
[00:24] has ever existed before and it's
[00:26] unfolding in real time. When you have
[00:27] two floating currencies in a in a free
[00:30] market, it just doesn't really make
[00:32] sense. And what Bitcoin is going to do
[00:33] is it's going to destroy the bond
[00:35] market. Now, there's a proposal to back
[00:38] bonds with Bitcoin. So, that could
[00:40] temporarily build a bridge. My
[00:43] preference would be a gradual, peaceful,
[00:47] nonvolatile transition between Bitcoin
[00:50] and fiat. Given what's happened over the
[00:52] last 15 and what's happened over the
[00:54] last 2 years, I don't think it's
[00:56] unrealistic to say that we won't have
[00:58] any fiat currencies in 10
[01:00] [Music]
[01:03] years. The the last time we met in so
[01:06] many interesting topics and I think one
[01:08] of the things were also uh the the
[01:10] sentence that I saw in the intro when I
[01:12] rewatched it and something that stuck
[01:15] with me. uh you said we living in a
[01:18] historic moment and I think you said
[01:19] Bitcoin is right now the most important
[01:21] thing that's going on. So this was about
[01:23] a year ago or half a year ago something
[01:25] like that. How does how has this changed
[01:28] in 2019 if it if at all or did it even
[01:30] get more more important now in the the
[01:33] current times we live in?
[01:35] So there
[01:37] was a a long period in my Bitcoin
[01:40] journey where I was worried that the
[01:43] government was going to ban it. Like
[01:45] right up until the election in the US,
[01:48] um I was worried about a sort of
[01:50] authoritarian communist future. And now
[01:53] with Trump in office, I have other
[01:55] concerns. You know, I don't trust
[01:56] politicians no matter who they are. But
[01:59] um the the Bitcoiners that work in his
[02:03] administration are
[02:05] passing legislation right now that is
[02:08] super bullish. I mean everything that's
[02:10] coming out. The SEC is dropping cases
[02:12] left and right. Uh not just like all
[02:16] across the cryptosphere, which is going
[02:17] to let off a lot of scammers, but this
[02:19] is what Republicans do. they they
[02:21] deregulate to their advantage, you know,
[02:24] and um so Bitcoin is weaving its way
[02:27] into the system. And I think
[02:31] that most people aren't paying attention
[02:34] at all. Like 99% of people aren't paying
[02:38] attention to what's happening. I think a
[02:40] lot of
[02:41] Bitcoiners included don't fully see the
[02:45] scope of what's unfolding right now.
[02:46] like there a it seems on um online a lot
[02:51] of guys get caught up in little
[02:54] short-term stuff without zooming out to
[02:57] look at the whole picture of what's
[02:58] actually unfolded over the last 5 10
[03:01] years and looking at the difference
[03:05] today in
[03:07] adoption versus five years ago even is
[03:11] insane. Uh just recently there was a a
[03:15] paper published that's it's looking like
[03:17] and I don't I'm not um a lawyer I can't
[03:20] interpret these documents but it's
[03:22] looking like it's going to allow
[03:24] lightning node runners to remain private
[03:28] and to not need licensing which is was
[03:31] one of the last things I was worried
[03:33] about. It was like one of the last
[03:35] little pieces of oh this is where they
[03:36] catch us is by tracking all the
[03:38] transactions. And it seems like
[03:40] Bitcoiners have woven their way into the
[03:42] system enough that we're just getting
[03:45] everything we want. Like everything that
[03:47] the political apparatus can do to stop
[03:50] us is getting brushed aside right now,
[03:53] which is amazing, you know, and
[03:55] simultaneously the price is falling,
[03:57] which is like unbelievable to me, you
[03:59] know. Yeah. It's like uh less risk and
[04:02] less uncertainty and more stories for
[04:06] your dollars, right? Yeah. Exactly. I uh
[04:10] I I think that a lot of people still of
[04:13] course in the investment world they see
[04:14] Bitcoin as a risk on asset and I think
[04:16] that 50 years from now that's going to
[04:18] be absolutely laughable you know but
[04:20] that's how it was when gold was um well
[04:22] not gold I can't go that far back but
[04:25] when oil was being adopted initially
[04:27] around the turn of the century um oil
[04:30] was seen as a very speculative
[04:31] investment and a lot of the responsible
[04:33] business people weren't touching it
[04:35] because it was too volatile and and
[04:37] that's what Bitcoin is today. I think
[04:39] yeah, like the volatility is something
[04:42] I'm always astonished how many people
[04:44] bring up volatility as an argument why
[04:46] they aren't into Bitcoin. It's just a
[04:50] natural thing for something that is
[04:53] right at the beginning and has such a
[04:56] huge vision that it will be volatile
[04:59] while it's getting adopted. That that's
[05:01] the logical thing. It would be it would
[05:03] be almost a red flag if Bitcoin price
[05:05] would go up like that. like that that
[05:07] would almost be unnatural that I I would
[05:10] ask myself like what's going on like who
[05:12] who's manipulating the price? If it's
[05:14] volatile that's normal. If it would be
[05:16] very smooth I would be like asking
[05:18] questions who who's behind the Bitcoin
[05:21] price, right? Yeah. I I think that the
[05:24] whole concern about volatility is a time
[05:27] preference issue, right? It's people
[05:29] that are too zoomed in on their chart
[05:31] and they're not thinking about what
[05:32] they're going to be in uh 2 years, 5
[05:35] years, 10 years, 20 years. And that's
[05:37] what Bitcoin did to me. I I wasn't
[05:39] thinking 20 years out in my life. Um I
[05:43] am now, you know, and uh there's other
[05:47] people also that say that
[05:49] Bitcoin, the Bitcoin volatility is not a
[05:53] Bitcoin issue. It's capturing the
[05:55] volatility of the fiat system. and we're
[05:57] actually able to see it on a ledger
[05:59] that's more truthful than anything that
[06:01] we have in the fiat system, which is a
[06:03] very
[06:04] radical understanding of Bitcoin. And I
[06:07] think it's like really far ahead of
[06:08] where most other people are. But I think
[06:11] there's truth to it. And we're probably
[06:12] going to see that unfold over the next
[06:15] 10 years. We're going to see that kind
[06:17] of uh become more and more apparent as
[06:20] more people understand it.
[06:22] Are we now basically officially because
[06:25] there's like those faces in in Bitcoin
[06:27] first they laugh at you then they they
[06:29] fight you and and then the face is like
[06:32] they are joining you is is that now the
[06:34] official uh state entering of
[06:37] governments are joining us even like
[06:40] China seems to be uh coming closer and
[06:42] closer to Bitcoin I think it's going to
[06:43] happen in different waves in different
[06:45] places you know and and I think that a
[06:48] lot of the people probably even the
[06:50] people who are writing these bills.
[06:52] Well, maybe not the people writing them,
[06:54] but the people that are passing these
[06:55] bills that are pro Bitcoin, they don't
[06:58] fully
[07:00] understand the gravity of what they're
[07:02] engaging in. They can't understand it,
[07:05] right? Because I've been researching
[07:06] this for like 10 years and I still don't
[07:09] understand it. And it's been said many
[07:11] times that nobody really understands
[07:13] Bitcoin fully because nothing like this
[07:17] has ever existed before and it's
[07:18] unfolding in real time. And so these
[07:21] people that they they they're thinking
[07:23] about how it's going to benefit them
[07:26] today or this week or this quarter or
[07:28] during this election cycle. And for sure
[07:31] it can and it will, but they're probably
[07:34] not understanding the implications of
[07:35] what it's going to do to the government
[07:37] over the next 100 years, right? And and
[07:40] that's why it's kind of a perfect
[07:41] digital Trojan horse. You also said at
[07:43] the beginning, and I'm really curious
[07:45] about that, you said that um we are too
[07:48] zoomed in. people are too zoomed in. I
[07:50] think we you're saying even even
[07:52] Bitcoiners are sometimes a little bit
[07:53] too zoomed in. What do you mean by
[07:56] what's going on and what's unfolding?
[07:58] So, what's the bigger picture here?
[08:01] Yeah.
[08:03] So, everything is hypothetical at this
[08:05] point, right? Uh is the is the Bitcoin
[08:08] standard going to reduce the size of
[08:10] governments? Um I think I mentioned that
[08:12] on the last conversation we had. That's
[08:14] hypothetical. uh it will remove the
[08:17] power for them to manipulate the
[08:18] currency which is going to take away a
[08:21] god-like power from the government
[08:23] basically for them to create value out
[08:26] of nothing. However, simultaneously we
[08:28] have a lot of automation surfacing. So
[08:32] um that can provide the government with
[08:34] the ability to sustain itself for a lot
[08:37] longer. And so when I talk about what's
[08:42] unfolding, it's the destruction of fiat.
[08:44] There's no two ways about it. And I know
[08:47] that Sailor knows this. It doesn't
[08:48] matter what he says in public. I I know
[08:51] that he knows that the dollar and
[08:53] Bitcoin can't coexist. Um he's playing a
[08:57] smart game, I think. Um I don't agree
[09:01] with everything that he says, but that's
[09:04] what's unfolding
[09:05] is fiat currencies are about to get
[09:08] exposed for what they are, which is
[09:11] lies. Basically, it's it's a it's a
[09:14] tremendous scam. And uh people look at
[09:17] Bitcoin, they say, "Oh, that's a Ponzi
[09:19] scheme. That's a
[09:20] scam." Yeah, sure. I mean, if if Bitcoin
[09:23] is a scam, then every commodity on the
[09:25] planet is a scam, right? Then all trade
[09:30] is a scam. Um it's it's just a uh it's a
[09:36] relative
[09:37] spectrum of what you're talking about.
[09:40] And most people don't realize what fiat
[09:43] is at its core. So I think that's what
[09:45] it is. It's a it's an awakening to a lie
[09:47] that's been going on for a very long
[09:49] time. Do you think uh the people in the
[09:53] government that are now pushing more for
[09:56] Bitcoin gets that Bitcoin is challenging
[09:59] the US dollar? Um it's it's a spectrum,
[10:03] right? I don't think Trump understands
[10:04] it, right? I I listened to him in
[10:07] Nashville in uh November, whenever that
[10:10] was, and he rambled on for an hour and a
[10:13] half or something, after making us wait
[10:15] for 2 hours um because apparently Elon's
[10:18] jet was flying overhead. The whole thing
[10:19] is just like so comedic and then this
[10:21] guy Jordy and like all this stuff that
[10:23] was going on. Um Trump gets people
[10:27] excited about what they're excited
[10:29] about. So, he just talked around until
[10:32] he found something that people cheered
[10:33] for and then he said that more, but he
[10:35] clearly didn't understand Bitcoin,
[10:37] right? And he didn't read off of a
[10:39] speech. RFK did read off of a speech
[10:41] that a Bitcoiner wrote. It was clear.
[10:44] Um, but I don't think these politicians
[10:46] understand it. I don't think they really
[10:48] care about it. I think that they care
[10:50] about their short-term self-interest,
[10:52] which is perfect Austrian theory, right?
[10:54] It's like everybody's a selfish actor
[10:57] and it just so happens that their
[10:59] selfish actions align with Bitcoin being
[11:01] adopted in every possible way. And there
[11:05] are real Bitcoiners behind the scenes
[11:07] working for these guys that are weaving
[11:09] in a lot of
[11:12] um I think governmental subversion,
[11:16] right?
[11:19] It's eventually if this keeps going the
[11:23] way it's going, the government isn't
[11:25] going to have anything to do. Like what
[11:26] are they going to be responsible for? Uh
[11:29] besides protecting the border, that's
[11:31] basically it, you know? So, um I don't
[11:35] know. Let's see. Let's see. That's super
[11:37] interesting. What What is the government
[11:41] responsibility if they cannot print
[11:43] money? So they have to ask for money
[11:45] from the citizens and there has to be
[11:48] consensus. I guess protecting the border
[11:51] might be a consensus maybe some minimal
[11:55] security healthc care for everyone. I
[11:57] don't know like where people find
[11:59] consensus but it's it's a really
[12:01] interesting question. It's it's it's
[12:03] actually a question that um I have since
[12:05] the first episode and and I'm still not
[12:08] 100% in an answer what Bitcoin will do
[12:12] to our society and how we will function
[12:14] if there's just Bitcoin. There's no
[12:16] other fiat currency. And there's a lot
[12:18] of debate as you said before. There's
[12:19] even a lot of debate going on in Bitcoin
[12:22] if we ever get there. If we have a
[12:24] Bitcoin standard without any fiat
[12:26] currencies or we have a Bitcoin standard
[12:28] where fiat currencies are backed by
[12:30] Bitcoin and some stuff like that. Yeah.
[12:34] Every time somebody tries to explain
[12:35] that to me, I don't understand it. Like
[12:37] how how do you back
[12:39] something that's uh floating? It's like
[12:41] backing silver with gold. Like how are
[12:43] you going to do that? You know, when you
[12:45] have two floating currencies in a in a
[12:47] free market, it just doesn't really make
[12:49] sense. And what Bitcoin is going to do
[12:51] is it's going to destroy the bond
[12:53] market. So now there's a proposal to
[12:57] back bonds with Bitcoin. So that could
[12:59] temporarily build a
[13:02] bridge. My preference would be a gradual
[13:06] peaceful
[13:08] nonvolatile transition between Bitcoin
[13:11] and fiat. The way things that are going
[13:14] are going right now that seems fully
[13:16] possible.
[13:18] Um, is it going to stay that way? I'm
[13:21] not sure. I think there's a uh I think
[13:22] there's a herd mentality in humans
[13:25] where when they reach a certain tipping
[13:28] point and there's enough people in on
[13:30] something, it causes a stampede. You
[13:33] know, it's just there's enough people
[13:35] paying attention to something, there's a
[13:37] a certain critical pivot. I don't know
[13:39] where that is. It's not really clear.
[13:42] Um, I lived through the time when the
[13:44] internet was just starting. So, I got to
[13:46] watch that and I got to watch
[13:49] smartphones get adopted and now I got to
[13:51] watch Uber and uh, you know, driverless
[13:55] cars and all these things. I live in a
[13:57] place where there's cars driving around
[13:59] with no people in them already. Um, how
[14:02] long is it going to take for that to
[14:04] wipe out all the Uber drive Uber
[14:06] drivers, right? Um, it there's a certain
[14:09] level of comfort. You have to be able to
[14:11] trust the technology to to get in that
[14:14] car and let it drive you somewhere. It's
[14:16] the same thing with Bitcoin. It's like
[14:18] you're going to put your money into this
[14:19] thing. You don't know if it's going to
[14:21] exist tomorrow. You don't know if it's
[14:22] going to
[14:23] crash. Uh, that uncertainty is going
[14:26] away really
[14:29] quickly. But most people need the big
[14:32] financial players to get in first before
[14:34] they feel safe, which is a huge
[14:35] disadvantage to them. But it is what it
[14:37] is. It's just human psychology. So
[14:41] it's also interesting this cycle. I I I
[14:43] talked with Danny and a lot of other
[14:45] people from but uh especially on that
[14:48] topic with Denny from coin corner and he
[14:51] basically said a bull market hasn't even
[14:53] started. If we just look at retail when
[14:56] he sees from coin corner they are having
[14:58] now I think like 11 years of data he
[15:00] says like retail isn't that interested
[15:03] in this this bull cycle and it's mostly
[15:05] driven by institutional and and bigger
[15:09] and deeper money pockets retail kind of
[15:12] did not start and then I looked at
[15:13] Google trends it's kind of confirming
[15:15] that uh bias where we are at what was it
[15:18] seven or 8% of the Google search volumes
[15:22] we at 2017 and it was I think like 20 or
[15:28] 15% of what where we were at 2021. So we
[15:31] are down a lot uh when you search for
[15:34] buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin or something like
[15:36] that. And it's interesting how
[15:39] institutions and corporations and
[15:42] companies uh are now getting more and
[15:44] more interested in in this uh uh talk is
[15:47] getting more and more kind of popular.
[15:50] How do you look at this? Yeah, the
[15:53] mainstream adoption, frankly, was a
[15:55] little scary to me at the speed it was
[15:58] happening. I I was um there was a lot of
[16:02] fear in the Bitcoin space. I could feel
[16:03] it
[16:05] online. People listening to Whitney
[16:07] Webb, who you know, I respect Whitney a
[16:10] lot. She's done great research. She
[16:11] doesn't understand Bitcoin yet. So, she
[16:14] doesn't understand the
[16:15] adversarial like um dynamics of game
[16:19] theory. as it applies to Bitcoin. But um
[16:23] when I see the level of mainstream
[16:25] adoption, I remember in I don't know
[16:29] 2015 or something, Bitcoin was mentioned
[16:32] on TV once and like everybody went crazy
[16:34] on Twitter. Oh my god, it was, you know,
[16:37] somebody said Bitcoin on TV and now it's
[16:40] being said on most channels once a day
[16:43] and it just seems like we've gotten used
[16:45] to it. And that's what I mean about
[16:47] zooming out. I don't know. It's a time
[16:49] preference issue. It's like I I just
[16:52] can it seeing the forest through the
[16:55] trees, you know the expression, right?
[16:57] So like if you look at just daily events
[16:59] of like, oh, I'm upset about the tariffs
[17:01] or I'm upset about this and that. It's
[17:03] like, yo, look, like think about what
[17:05] Bitcoin did in your life and then look
[17:09] at how many people are talking about it
[17:11] now and what it's going to do in all of
[17:13] their lives and what it's going to do to
[17:14] the government and all these
[17:15] corporations that are holding on to it.
[17:17] It's unfathomable. I I don't know what
[17:19] societyy's going to look like in 20
[17:21] years as a result of this. Yeah. It's
[17:23] also as you said I I still don't
[17:25] understand the people that say the US
[17:28] dollar will be better because of Bitcoin
[17:31] and stronger because maybe medium-term
[17:34] uh of like when USA is adopting Bitcoin
[17:38] faster than any other nation and they
[17:40] have a lot of purchasing power and they
[17:42] can put Bitcoin on the reserves which
[17:44] makes uh government or the central banks
[17:47] stronger and therefore also US dollar
[17:49] maybe also with this Tedar and uh uh
[17:53] stable coin things that might also be be
[17:56] a thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad you asked
[17:58] that actually cuz I I had a a recent
[18:02] realization around this. I think there
[18:04] are a lot of Bitcoiners that have known
[18:05] this for a very long time. They don't
[18:06] always talk about it because there's
[18:08] like a there's a subset of Bitcoiners
[18:11] that just as soon as you mention any
[18:13] other cryptocurrency, they they go
[18:15] haywire. And I understand that because
[18:17] they're all scams. Like I'm I'm not
[18:20] there's no two ways about it. Tron is
[18:22] the main thing that's running Tether and
[18:24] that's a scam. Uh so it is what it is.
[18:27] But I do see a scenario where the dollar
[18:29] gets way stronger temporarily and that
[18:33] is
[18:34] basically now Tether is becoming like a
[18:37] second Federal Reserve. It's like a a
[18:40] more private digital version of the
[18:42] Federal Reserve that's not on US
[18:44] soil, which I could see from a Whitney
[18:47] Web standpoint why that's very
[18:48] concerning. And uh Lola Leites pointed
[18:51] out to me that
[18:53] um what's his name? The EOS guy
[18:58] uh he had connections with Epstein and
[19:01] he was involved in the founding of
[19:02] Tether. So there's definitely some
[19:04] mystery there. Uh I'm not saying it's
[19:06] good, right? I'm just saying this is
[19:08] what's unfolding. The the Tether
[19:10] organization is becoming a second
[19:12] Federal Reserve, which could be at least
[19:15] a partial solution to the Triffins
[19:17] dilemma.
[19:18] Are you familiar with the troph dilemma?
[19:20] We actually had it last uh last episode
[19:23] on a little bit, but I think it's it's
[19:25] something that we we should definitely
[19:27] get get more often because last I heard
[19:30] it yesterday the first time. Okay, I
[19:32] should just mention it for anybody that
[19:33] doesn't know. So the triffins dilemma is
[19:35] basically the issue that when you're the
[19:37] global reserve currency, you need to
[19:40] constantly be
[19:41] exporting your currency in order to feed
[19:44] the global economy. And as a result,
[19:46] what ends up happening is all your
[19:48] manufacturing leaves and you become a
[19:50] net importer and that can lead to
[19:52] collapse. And that's kind of what Trump
[19:54] seems to be trying to reverse right now.
[19:57] Um, so anyway, with Tether, you can feed
[20:03] the desire for dollars globally in a way
[20:06] that doesn't inflate dollars at
[20:10] home.
[20:12] And that's probably going to end up
[20:14] destroying one currency after another
[20:16] all over the planet and the whole world
[20:18] is going to dollarize. That's so Europe
[20:21] is in is in the planning phase to launch
[20:24] a CBDC in October which is very soon
[20:27] which is crazy. I don't think people
[20:30] want
[20:31] CBDC's. So there's a couple different
[20:34] ways they can do it. They can force
[20:36] people to take the CBDC through welfare.
[20:39] you know, they can they can create a
[20:40] situation where it's like, "All right,
[20:42] if you want your benefits or we'll give
[20:44] you a UBI, but you have to scan your
[20:46] eyeballs and like let us track
[20:48] everything. They can do that and they
[20:50] they might try." Is the government
[20:52] competent enough to pull that off?
[20:54] Probably not, right? Um, I would bet
[20:58] against it. Yeah, I would bet against
[21:00] that as well. And I think that a lot of
[21:02] people inside Europe are very tech-savvy
[21:05] and they're probably willing to run
[21:07] open-source technology and they would
[21:09] probably prefer to hold Tether dollars
[21:11] over some government CBDC. And then the
[21:14] really smart ones are going to buy
[21:15] Bitcoin and eventually it's all going to
[21:17] end up in Bitcoin. But a lot of other
[21:20] countries that are less developed are
[21:23] already adopting Tether as a as a means
[21:26] of exchange. And so that makes their
[21:30] local currencies obsolete basically
[21:33] overnight. Uh which would strengthen the
[21:35] dollar. It would give us more purchasing
[21:37] power. We'd be able to import more. So
[21:39] there's this huge thing unfolding, which
[21:41] is a little scary, right, from a
[21:44] surveillance standpoint. I I I don't I
[21:46] don't necessarily trust Tether, but the
[21:48] CEO is a real Bitcoiner. Uh and he's
[21:51] stacking Bitcoin simultaneously, and
[21:53] they're also now making more money than
[21:55] BlackRock. So, I don't think there's
[21:57] anything stopping this. It's just
[21:59] happening. Yeah, they I think they have
[22:02] uh I've looked it up recently. I think
[22:03] they have 100k Bitcoin or something like
[22:06] that. They have quite a good good amount
[22:08] of stack. Uh which which is which is
[22:11] great to see. But is that that's just
[22:13] that's all just short term like or
[22:15] medium-term? Uh Ted and those things
[22:18] they don't have a future in a bit. No.
[22:22] No. But it it doesn't I mean medium-term
[22:24] is a little relative. I don't know what
[22:26] that time frame looks like. Is it 5
[22:28] years? Is it 10 years? Is it 15 years? I
[22:31] don't think so. Frankly, I think that
[22:32] we're
[22:34] probably we can say I probably 10 years
[22:36] away from that whole system being
[22:39] obsolete. I mean, that's a little
[22:41] extreme, but just given what's happened
[22:44] over the last 15 and what's happened
[22:46] over the last two years, I don't think
[22:48] it's unrealistic to say that we won't
[22:50] have any fiat currencies in 10 years.
[22:54] Oh, wow. But, you know, that that's um
[22:57] that's probably too much to say that,
[23:00] but it's going to be a good sound bite
[23:02] for your intro.
[23:04] Uh I uh uh what was I gonna say? So, I
[23:09] lost it. No, no worries. No worries.
[23:12] It's super interesting uh when we when
[23:14] we look at the play and and it's it's
[23:17] it's it's really interesting because I I
[23:19] had uh people on I think the the most
[23:22] extreme was
[23:24] law who came on the show uh and said
[23:28] that he sees the US dollar not surviving
[23:32] three years. And this
[23:35] was this I think this was like one year
[23:38] ago. So, let's see how it goes for the
[23:39] next two years. I I said something very
[23:42] similar actually to somebody um my buddy
[23:45] in Germany and he said, "What's your
[23:48] time frame on fiat dying?" And I said
[23:49] two years and that was last year. So, uh
[23:52] maybe Lao and I are are on the same
[23:55] estimation time frame. But, you know, a
[23:57] lot of Bitcoiners have been saying that
[23:58] for a long time. And I think many of us
[24:00] have underestimated the cleverness and
[24:03] the strength of the fiat system and also
[24:07] how absolutely asleep most people are
[24:09] mostly due to stress and debt which is
[24:12] caused by the fiat system. You know so
[24:13] it's like a self-perpetuating
[24:15] unconsciousness machine. It's it's
[24:17] almost like they have such a strong
[24:19] network effect and it's like a mind trap
[24:23] that if you're in this fear system and
[24:25] you look everything through the sphere
[24:27] system, it's really hard to imagine that
[24:30] not being around because your frame of
[24:33] mind is is right right there. And I
[24:37] needed three three years I needed to get
[24:41] out of the thinking that Bitcoin is a
[24:43] scam. Then I needed one year to where I
[24:48] first bought Bitcoin. Then I need one
[24:49] year to get really aggressively in
[24:52] Bitcoin. And then I need another two
[24:54] years to really think, oh, like Bitcoin
[24:56] is actually a sol. I was all in Bitcoin.
[24:59] I still thought that fiat will will be
[25:01] our currency and Bitcoin just a savings
[25:03] device. And I needed another two years
[25:05] to break that uh fiat um uh mind frame.
[25:10] So the network effect and the mind strap
[25:13] is so strong. I that's why I I would
[25:18] wish it it would go in like two years,
[25:20] but I don't know if I don't see it
[25:22] because the network effect of of it is
[25:24] so strong. Yeah. I honestly I don't
[25:27] really wish that it would take you two
[25:28] years because that transition would be
[25:30] so volatile for so many people that it
[25:34] would cause a lot of harm actually. I
[25:36] would I'd probably prefer that it's more
[25:37] gradual. Um but just looking at the way
[25:40] technology is adopted I don't I don't
[25:42] know I it's the thing is that hyper
[25:45] bitcoinization happens for each
[25:47] individual it doesn't it eventually
[25:50] it'll happen for society but once you
[25:52] kind of cross the threshold yourself the
[25:55] world looks different and then it
[25:56] actually becomes hard to make
[25:58] estimations about timing and all this
[26:00] stuff which is fine I don't I don't have
[26:03] any desire to look back but I've noticed
[26:06] that a lot of Bitcoiners can say things
[26:08] like, oh yeah, fiat's going to be gone
[26:09] in 2 years and that it's clearly hasn't
[26:11] panned out. Uh, Safeodine has has
[26:14] expected uh fiat to go down for a long
[26:17] time. He he thought that adoption was
[26:18] going to happen faster. He was he was
[26:20] also really pushing the um the uh stock
[26:23] toflow model which has not panned out
[26:25] very well. I think personally the
[26:27] stockflow model is going to be broken to
[26:29] the upside at some point and it's just
[26:31] going to get smashed. But um it's it's
[26:34] it hasn't been an effective way of
[26:36] predicting the price. That's for sure.
[26:38] Yeah, this all those price models. I I I
[26:42] don't like price models. It's it's
[26:44] interesting and it might give people
[26:46] some guidance of like where the
[26:48] potential might go. Uh but at the end of
[26:52] the day, you're like, "Okay, I I I think
[26:55] it's you either come to the conclusion
[26:57] that Bitcoin is the best asset and uh
[27:00] and the the most important thing that's
[27:01] going on currently or you don't." And if
[27:04] you come to that conclusion that it is
[27:06] the most important thing, what would you
[27:07] sell it for? What would you trade it
[27:09] for? What what would you do it for
[27:12] without it? So that if you are anyways
[27:16] very aggressively in that asset, why why
[27:18] do you care where where where it's going
[27:21] kind of? Yeah, I tend to think not in
[27:23] terms of the dollar price but more in
[27:25] terms of purchasing power, you know,
[27:26] it's like what what can I actually buy
[27:28] with my Bitcoin? Um and right right now
[27:31] there's a lot of products coming out
[27:33] where you can take out loans against
[27:34] Bitcoin which is going to accelerate the
[27:36] speculative attack. It and finally
[27:39] so bit uh the shitcoiners have had
[27:43] access to near infinite capital for a
[27:45] very long time. It's like the the only
[27:48] ceiling on their capital was the degree
[27:50] to which they could scam their
[27:52] customers. And um now that's starting to
[27:56] fall apart because basically they can
[27:58] only scam retail. Nobody's buying the
[28:00] Ethereum ETF, which is hilarious.
[28:03] Ethereum is going to zero against
[28:05] Bitcoin uh finally. And
[28:09] um Bitcoiners are now reaching a point
[28:11] where they can take out fiat using
[28:14] Bitcoin as collateral, which is going to
[28:15] give them a dramatically more finances
[28:19] to to work with without selling their
[28:22] Bitcoin. So, um I I think the tables are
[28:26] really turning hard and we're not going
[28:29] to see the results of that for a few
[28:32] more years, I guess. But, uh I'm seeing
[28:35] it in my own life. So, it's definitely
[28:38] happened for other people.
[28:41] Awesome. It's it's it's great to see
[28:43] that the adoption happening. One thing
[28:46] that I was wondering, I I don't know if
[28:48] we talked last time about privacy
[28:50] because uh you show up with um your real
[28:53] face and and there are a lot of like a
[28:55] lot of I think like I had five to 10
[28:57] guests already on that were completely
[29:00] anonymous like no real face, no real uh
[29:03] name. Uh so you are doing the face, yes,
[29:07] but not the name. has privacy and and
[29:10] being anonymous getting more and more
[29:13] unimportant as Bitcoin is getting more
[29:16] and more accepted by by the mainstream.
[29:19] Is is is that a fair assumption? Yeah.
[29:22] Uh it's been a journey for me personally
[29:24] because I I default to privacy, but
[29:27] there's something about being seen and
[29:29] making connections with people face to
[29:31] face and shaking people's hands and like
[29:32] really knowing them that I think is
[29:34] super important in the Bitcoin network.
[29:37] we're not just a bunch of people that
[29:38] live on islands with guns. It's like
[29:41] that's not a future, you know. Um, and
[29:45] so I realized eventually I was going to
[29:47] I was going to have to um talk to people
[29:50] in person about this. And also I orange
[29:53] pill people everywhere I go. Uh, so it's
[29:55] been a a gradual step by step. I
[29:58] actually started out writing name
[29:59] writing articles under my name so it's
[30:01] not that hard to find out who I am. Uh,
[30:04] but I use source node because in the US
[30:08] we don't have protections against
[30:11] um, uh, privacy. So like if you had my
[30:14] full name, you could actually look up
[30:16] the properties that I own. You could
[30:18] look up my phone number. You could look
[30:19] up all these things. So that's right now
[30:22] I'm using this pseudonym. Uh, I probably
[30:25] won't use it forever. The other reason
[30:27] that I started using it is because one
[30:30] of the first articles I wrote was about
[30:32] psychedelics in Bitcoin. And it be it
[30:35] was obvious to me at the time what I was
[30:37] doing was subverting the power structure
[30:39] that exists on this planet. That was my
[30:42] goal. That was my whole intention behind
[30:44] writing that. And uh I thought that was
[30:47] going to be obvious to other people as
[30:49] well, but it it's apparently not.
[30:52] And while Bitcoin is becoming adopted in
[30:56] the mainstream, that makes me a that I
[30:59] feel a lot safer obviously. Um, and then
[31:03] also it seems like there's a lot of
[31:05] discussion around the positive benefits
[31:06] of psychedelics as well. And so it seems
[31:09] like many of my concerns, and this is a
[31:11] general theme in my life, many of my
[31:13] concerns and paranoia about whatever,
[31:16] you know, entity or group might be um
[31:20] opposing me were unfounded and they were
[31:24] just I I I saw this sign on a church one
[31:27] time. It said, "Fear is a liar." They
[31:30] put it on these these plastic letters on
[31:32] the church board in the front. It said,
[31:34] "Fear is a liar." And I was like, "Oh
[31:37] man, that's so good." I think about that
[31:38] every day. It's true. Every time you get
[31:41] scared of something, it's it's uh
[31:45] usually turns out to be blown out of
[31:47] proportion. It that's okay. That's
[31:49] speaking from a position of having a
[31:52] pretty good life, right? I don't have
[31:54] drones flying overhead uh where I live,
[31:57] but that's that's been my experience.
[31:59] Yeah. And even if I mean uh staying
[32:03] anonymous uh is is like a fair choice
[32:05] and there's a lot of things that that
[32:07] that you can do with that. But obviously
[32:09] I do like the because I actually thought
[32:12] about it when starting this journey
[32:15] intentionally of which route I should go
[32:18] and it's it's awesome to connect with
[32:20] people uh and people see you and people
[32:23] actually recognize you and then you can
[32:25] connect them. If I'm would be just an
[32:27] avatar and they don't know how I look or
[32:30] how how what's my name in in real life
[32:32] when I go around conferences they
[32:34] wouldn't um see me and then we wouldn't
[32:37] had had this those uh meeting points and
[32:41] and those conversations which are really
[32:43] uh um yeah that's the main reason why I
[32:45] go to conferences to meet people that I
[32:48] otherwise wouldn't meet and this is a
[32:50] lot there's a lot of value in that and I
[32:53] I I choose not to let fear drive my uh
[32:58] drive my decisions. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
[33:02] Yeah. At the same time, I I totally
[33:04] understand why people want to be
[33:06] anonymous and I respect it and I and I
[33:09] um admire the ability to do that if
[33:12] that's their trade-off, right? So,
[33:13] everybody makes a personal calculation
[33:15] about their privacy and I think
[33:16] everybody should have the right to have
[33:18] that privacy and have the technology to
[33:20] have that privacy. I do really worry
[33:22] about, you know, KYC on uh Bitcoin and
[33:26] on websites like X. Um the the big
[33:31] surveillance panopticon of big tech is
[33:33] is a is a continuous problem. It's not
[33:36] something that Bitcoin is going to fix
[33:38] on its own in my opinion. And that's why
[33:40] I use Noster.
[33:42] Do uh you solely use Nostra now? Yeah, I
[33:46] deleted my X before it was called X. So
[33:49] I never had an X account. I was on
[33:51] Twitter and um as soon as I started
[33:54] using Noster, I was like, "Oh, this is
[33:56] the thing I've been waiting for for the
[33:58] last 15, 20 years of using centralized
[34:01] social media." I always felt weird about
[34:03] it. And yeah, Nostra is still clunky. It
[34:06] doesn't work perfect. There's problems,
[34:08] but to me, it's the forefront of where
[34:11] this movement is going. If you're if you
[34:13] actually care about freedom and it's not
[34:15] just about number go up and it's not
[34:18] just about uh clout then I think that
[34:21] Noster is uh the next logical step and
[34:25] maybe that particular technology doesn't
[34:27] end up working but we need some way of
[34:31] opensource distributed system of
[34:34] communication like we need that for our
[34:36] freedom you know yeah it's it's it's
[34:39] almost like with Bitcoin even if
[34:42] Bitcoin would fail which I give a 0.001%
[34:46] 00 1%
[34:48] chance even in that case I would still
[34:51] say let's build the next one because we
[34:55] this idea is so good just because the
[34:58] technology failed we we will we need it
[35:01] anyways and the same with Nostra if if
[35:04] Nostra for some reason doesn't work
[35:05] doesn't scale doesn't whatever the the
[35:08] technical problem would be an
[35:10] opensource communication layer a social
[35:13] graph whatever you want to call it we
[35:16] need that. Yeah. As a creator, I I I
[35:19] upload this episode on five different
[35:22] platforms. Wow. That that that shouldn't
[35:25] be the case. you should upload it once
[35:27] and and it should be everywhere and it
[35:29] should be and also um I I had a massive
[35:33] moment with Nostra where I saw in my
[35:36] fountain which is connected to my nostra
[35:38] and I replied to a comment there and
[35:42] then I opened primal which is also
[35:44] connected with my same nostra and I
[35:47] could uh engage in the same conversation
[35:49] there and I was blown away because when
[35:54] you have for example a comment under
[35:56] your YouTube video and you reply to
[35:58] that, you don't see that on Twitter,
[36:01] right? And and that would be awesome to
[36:04] have things that I post on YouTube are
[36:07] also automatically on Twitter and
[36:09] they're also connected with Facebook and
[36:11] on WhatsApp. I also see it and
[36:12] everything is interconnected with an
[36:14] open source protocol. I don't want that
[36:16] on a centralized platform because then
[36:20] this platform has too much control. So
[36:22] it needs to be connected open source and
[36:25] not control centrally which basically
[36:27] isn't
[36:29] right. Yeah, absolutely. That's why I
[36:31] love it. And there's so many little
[36:33] advantages. The main disadvantage right
[36:36] now I think is uh the network effect
[36:38] which is fine. I don't need to talk to
[36:40] everybody. In fact, I don't want to talk
[36:42] to most people. You know, it's like I
[36:43] I'm talking to Bitcoiners on Noster.
[36:47] That's like it's like a giant group chat
[36:49] of people that are that care about
[36:51] similar things that I do. And we still
[36:53] disagree on a lot of things, right?
[36:55] People talk about it being an echo
[36:56] chamber. But man, we have disagreements
[36:58] all the time and I learn stuff which I I
[37:01] prefer to learn from people that I
[37:03] respect that have similar values, you
[37:05] know, to myself. But yeah, I don't want
[37:07] to live in a WeChat world, you know. And
[37:10] recently there was an interview with
[37:11] Elon. I don't know who which podcast he
[37:13] was on, but he said he wants X to become
[37:17] 50% of the global financial system. He
[37:19] he said that it was one of his goals.
[37:22] And uh if you've tracked the history of
[37:24] Elon, when he says stuff like that, he
[37:26] accomplishes it. He will like I don't
[37:29] know what his plan is or who he's hiring
[37:31] to do whatever, but these are not uh
[37:36] idle comments and I don't want to be
[37:39] part of that world, you know? I don't I
[37:41] I don't want to have to trust a big tech
[37:44] corporation or some guy that I don't
[37:45] know with all my data. Let's take a
[37:47] break for a moment and appreciate the
[37:50] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[37:53] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[37:55] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[37:58] of showing that you are a true
[38:01] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[38:04] dropped a completely new and amazing
[38:06] Genesis edition of their watch
[38:09] collections. You have the date of the
[38:11] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[38:15] and of course also the block height and
[38:17] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[38:20] the level of detail they put in in this
[38:23] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[38:25] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[38:29] down in the descriptions. I love those
[38:31] watches so so much. And now if you have
[38:34] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[38:37] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[38:39] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[38:41] to deal with that. The first way is you
[38:43] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[38:45] entry for you to get into the
[38:48] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[38:51] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[38:54] super simple and secure way. And if you
[38:57] check out the link in the description,
[38:59] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[39:02] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[39:05] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[39:08] partner in terms of how to get the most
[39:11] out of your sovereignty. They will
[39:13] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[39:16] that is perfect for your individual
[39:19] situation. They will show you how you
[39:22] can secure your own devices. Securing
[39:24] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[39:26] have to keep all your devices secure.
[39:29] One topic that is overlooked often is
[39:31] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[39:34] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[39:37] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[39:39] place already? And last but not least,
[39:41] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[39:43] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[39:46] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[39:51] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[39:54] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[39:56] be for the first time ever speaking at
[39:59] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[40:02] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[40:04] really looking forward to seeing all of
[40:06] you there. You can get your ticket in
[40:09] the link down in the description of
[40:11] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[40:13] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[40:17] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[40:19] there. He doesn't always deliver on
[40:21] time, but he usually delivers things.
[40:23] So, um, him saying things is is scary
[40:26] because he has the resources and the
[40:28] abilities to actually pull things off
[40:30] that sound crazy. If if anyone else
[40:33] would say that, you're like, "Yeah, of
[40:34] course, tried, but he he might actually
[40:37] pull it off." Yeah, maybe. I mean, those
[40:40] the Tesla roofs, I guess, never took
[40:42] off. But otherwise, I think he's done
[40:44] all the other things he said he was
[40:45] going to do. Yeah, of course. like there
[40:48] there are lot a lot of small failures
[40:50] that that he lived through like every
[40:52] entrepreneur but uh overall especially
[40:56] with SpaceX it's it's just fascinating
[40:59] to to to to see that story and how many
[41:02] failures it was in the beginning how
[41:03] much money they they burned uh how how
[41:07] big of a is it a headwind how big of a
[41:10] headwind they they they got they're very
[41:13] important for for space exploration to
[41:16] say the least Yeah, it's wild what's
[41:18] unfolding right now. Do do you think uh
[41:21] something like that will eventually
[41:23] break the network effect like Nostra or
[41:26] anything like that? It seems like even
[41:28] Facebook is still around and I don't it
[41:31] seems like Facebook is called that since
[41:33] since like five years and it's it's
[41:35] still the biggest network. Yeah. So
[41:38] there are a lot of people in the world
[41:40] especially in the less developed areas
[41:41] that are
[41:43] uh interfacing with the internet
[41:45] exclusively through Facebook.
[41:47] So, that's part of the w the reason it
[41:50] still works. It's very useful as a um
[41:54] place to do commerce. Uh a lot of the
[41:56] people that I know who have their
[41:58] Facebook accounts, all they do is use
[42:01] the marketplace, which used to be
[42:03] Craigslist. Craigslist is gone.
[42:04] Craigslist was really like it was kind
[42:07] of sketchy, but it was kind of cool. I
[42:08] loved Craigslist. I don't know if you
[42:09] guys had that in Europe, but um yeah.
[42:12] What else do people use Facebook for?
[42:14] They use it to advertise their
[42:15] businesses. that's less popular now
[42:17] mostly now that's on Instagram which is
[42:20] owned by Facebook so they're staying
[42:22] relevant but being fed ads being forced
[42:26] into an algorithm that's manipulating
[42:28] you something I've been noticing is that
[42:30] people that spend a lot of time on these
[42:32] centralized social media platforms they
[42:35] have different behavior behavior
[42:36] patterns than people that don't I I live
[42:39] in a place now where I meet a lot of
[42:41] people that don't have social media
[42:43] they've they've uh chosen to opt out and
[42:46] they're they're socially different
[42:49] people. I I don't know how to put it.
[42:51] It's similar to when you're you
[42:53] understand Bitcoin and you you interact
[42:56] with somebody that doesn't and you're
[42:57] like,
[42:58] "Huh, something's not right here." Like,
[43:01] "This isn't we're we're not on the same
[43:03] page." And I can't quite put my finger
[43:06] on it yet, but it's very early. Uh very
[43:08] early in the process of hyperostization.
[43:12] I never heard that the
[43:13] hypernosterization.
[43:15] I don't know who said it first, but it's
[43:17] happening. I love that. Yeah, it's it's
[43:20] also interesting how algorithms
[43:23] will will develop because Tik Tok set
[43:28] basically the standard for how Twitter
[43:32] and how the YouTube shorts and and how
[43:34] most algorithms work. Pre previously it
[43:37] was a follower list subscribers. So when
[43:40] you had like 10,000 subscribers and you
[43:43] send out something, most of them saw it.
[43:45] Now subscribers and followers like it
[43:49] doesn't matter any at all. Now if you
[43:52] have a good piece of content um it will
[43:54] go you you can reach with a 500 follower
[43:57] account uh 500 million maybe not 500
[44:00] million that's a little bit too much but
[44:02] like a million people and you could
[44:05] reach with a million uh subscriber
[44:07] account like 500 people or a,000 people.
[44:09] There's so many YouTubers account that
[44:11] have 200,000 subscribers that post a
[44:14] video and don't reach a thousand views
[44:17] because now the individual uh condom
[44:21] piece is is very high in the rating and
[44:26] how many followers do you have is is
[44:28] almost I'm not subscribed to most
[44:31] YouTube channels that I watch because
[44:32] YouTube knows I want to watch them. They
[44:34] give it to me on the homepage and and I
[44:36] don't subscribe anymore.
[44:38] So, it's always interesting how
[44:41] algorithms evolve and how they get us
[44:45] hooked more and more. And I'm wondering
[44:48] if the same thing might happen with with
[44:51] Nostra because some maybe someone comes
[44:54] along, develops an app that makes people
[44:57] addicted, addictive behavior might leads
[45:00] to more users and and they just like and
[45:03] then other platforms also adopt that
[45:05] that same algorithms. I'm I'm just I'm
[45:08] really curious how Nostra will will will
[45:10] develop. Yeah. So, I am full-on addicted
[45:14] to Amethyst and I love VTour. Uh and and
[45:17] it's a it's a crazy app in some ways. It
[45:20] does a little bit of everything. It's
[45:21] like the Swiss Army knife of Nostra, but
[45:24] um yeah, I I check it every day. You
[45:26] know what what I really don't like about
[45:28] these algorithms is a lot of people like
[45:31] millions of people all over the world
[45:33] have been focused on getting
[45:34] subscribers, right? And then Google
[45:37] behind the scenes, they're like, "Okay,
[45:38] actually that model isn't working for us
[45:41] anymore. We're going to change the
[45:43] model." Did they make an announcement?
[45:44] Probably not. They just started to tweak
[45:46] things and change things. And all of a
[45:48] sudden, the incentives have shifted for
[45:50] everybody else. And Bitcoiners love to
[45:52] talk about malinvestment and like
[45:54] misaligned incentives when it comes to
[45:56] money, but they're not necessarily
[45:58] always looking at the other ways in
[46:01] which we get manipulated by the news, by
[46:04] the social media websites, by literally
[46:06] everything you interact with. You go to
[46:08] the grocery store, everything in there
[46:09] is designed by psychologists to
[46:11] manipulate you, you know. So, it it is
[46:14] what it is. Some people do seem to be
[46:16] aware of it. Um, and most of those
[46:18] people are using Nostra.
[46:22] Well, I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the
[46:25] topic of of of Nostra, even though I'm
[46:27] not that deep into it. Um, I'm I just
[46:30] hope that uh we we don't lose all the
[46:33] Bitcoiners right now to Nostra. So,
[46:35] there are some people orange spilling on
[46:37] other platforms.
[46:40] Yeah, there's always going to be people
[46:41] in the fray that are on Tik Tok. And
[46:44] talk about a high time preference
[46:46] website. Tik Tok is like Tik Tok first
[46:48] of all would not exist if uh Twitter
[46:51] hadn't killed Vine back in the day. I
[46:53] don't know if you ever used Vine, but
[46:55] better than Tik Tok. Yeah. And and then
[46:58] and then Tik Tok took took the whole
[47:00] market and it's it's crazy. It's
[47:03] training people's attention span to be
[47:06] shorter and shorter and shorter and
[47:07] shorter. It's wild. I I picked up the
[47:10] app once. I saw one video and it
[47:13] triggered an emotional response in me. I
[47:16] don't remember what it was. It was
[47:17] something terrible. It was like somebody
[47:19] being injured, I think. And I was like,
[47:22] "Yeah, no. I'm out. Like, I'm done. I
[47:24] put that I put the app down. I didn't I
[47:26] uninstalled it."
[47:28] Um, but yeah, there there will always be
[47:30] people that are making other content.
[47:32] Why? Because there's lots of fiat juice
[47:34] to be squeezed. there's lots of money to
[47:36] be made uh by people who are, you know,
[47:40] are content creators like yourself that
[47:42] that go out and get on other platforms.
[47:45] Personally, I've completely in the same
[47:47] way that I've withdrawn my energy from
[47:49] the fiat system, I've withdrawn my
[47:51] energy from Twitter. I don't engage in
[47:53] arguments with people on Twitter. I
[47:55] don't want to [ __ ] talk to an XRP
[47:57] guy. I don't like I just that
[47:59] conversation is not interesting to me
[48:00] anymore. It was in 2017 because I didn't
[48:03] know the difference. So, I needed to
[48:05] like debate and kind of get my head
[48:06] around it. And on Nostra, we have a
[48:08] bunch of um Monero people. Uh I don't
[48:12] debate with them either because it's
[48:13] like why even engage? I don't They're
[48:15] They're so salty. They're so sour and
[48:18] salty and desperate. And uh I would be
[48:21] too if the price action looked like that
[48:23] on Bitcoin. But um you
[48:26] know I have other things to focus on
[48:30] than than uh trying to orange pill
[48:32] strangers on the internet. You know I
[48:34] and I appreciate the people that do it,
[48:36] but um I've successfully orange pill
[48:38] almost every person I know personally
[48:41] like in my real life and I'm proud of
[48:44] that. Um and I'm going to continue to do
[48:46] that for all the people that I care
[48:48] about.
[48:49] uh with the exception of one person that
[48:51] I'm really I'm still working on and and
[48:54] she's got more capital than everybody I
[48:55] know put together, but she just is
[48:58] stubborn. So stubborn.
[49:00] Yeah. But it's okay. I never looked at
[49:04] Monero price charts. I'm doing this
[49:06] right now for the first time ever. Check
[49:09] it again. Yeah. Is is it possible on on
[49:13] Google to do that? Uh might need to go
[49:15] to Trading View. If you put in like
[49:18] it's it's it's I love that. Put it on
[49:20] the max max chart. Boom. Yeah, dude. I
[49:25] mean, all the shitcoins do that. It's
[49:26] not a surprise. It's just these guys,
[49:28] you know, they want to look at child
[49:30] porn or whatever. Oh, probably edit that
[49:32] out. If you put that in your YouTube,
[49:33] you'll get censored.
[49:35] Yeah.
[49:38] Uh oh gosh. Oh man. I'm just I'm just
[49:40] messing around. Privacy is important,
[49:42] but not on the main chain. Like not on
[49:44] not on layer one. It's super interesting
[49:46] uh to look at to look at those things.
[49:49] Yeah, Monero is I I sometimes I the the
[49:53] Ripple guys are more annoying. Monero is
[49:56] is just a a little thing that comes here
[49:59] and there uh on Twitter and also on on
[50:02] YouTube, but it's so rare. It's like one
[50:05] comment a month or something like that.
[50:07] And Ripple comes in waves. So right now
[50:10] there's nothing and then all of the
[50:12] sudden there's like a week where you
[50:14] have almost every second comment is a
[50:15] ripple comment where I'm like are they
[50:17] bot farming? What? How are they
[50:19] organizing that? That this is organized.
[50:22] This is not natural. No. Yeah. I don't
[50:25] know how they do it, but they're
[50:26] incredible. And I know I have met people
[50:28] in real life that got caught up in that
[50:30] scam. I mean like really big time. Uh I
[50:33] I was dating a girl. This was at a time
[50:35] that I didn't really like understand
[50:37] Bitcoin that well and I but I was
[50:40] already 90% in I and she was 90% in
[50:45] Ripple and I was like one of us is
[50:49] wrong. There's no way that we're both
[50:51] right. Uh, so I don't know, but um, she
[50:55] seems to have done okay, I guess,
[50:57] because she she held until this most
[51:00] recent Forex and I I think now she gets
[51:02] it and she's like moving her her bit
[51:04] she's moving into Bitcoin somewhat, I
[51:06] guess. I don't you know, we don't talk
[51:08] about her finances too much, but we've
[51:10] stayed in touch over the years.
[51:13] Interesting. Um, one more thing that I
[51:15] want to touch on because you mentioned
[51:17] it. Uh I don't know if you already uh
[51:18] want to talk about it, but you you
[51:20] started writing a book. Do do uh is
[51:24] there already because I know that
[51:26] writing a book is because I'm trying it
[51:29] myself. It's a very complicated long
[51:31] process. How far are you already? Yeah,
[51:34] it's it's uh probably 75% of the way
[51:38] through the writing portion of it, but
[51:41] maybe only 40% of the way through the
[51:43] work that's going to be required because
[51:45] I need to edit and and polish and and
[51:48] make sure it all flows right and um
[51:51] really sleep on it. But um yeah, the
[51:54] general idea
[51:55] is Bitcoin has won or it is winning.
[52:00] There's always caveats. You can always
[52:01] point to oh what if this happens? what
[52:03] if that happens? But every time I have a
[52:05] what if, the Bitcoin network eventually
[52:08] solves it for me without me having to
[52:12] worry about it. Um, I was I was just
[52:16] reading uh yeah, I think it's the book
[52:19] of Luke yesterday and and Jesus said,
[52:22] "Has worrying ever added a day to your
[52:25] life?" Like it doesn't it's if you're if
[52:28] you're anxious, it doesn't benefit
[52:29] anybody. So anyway, I've had concerns in
[52:32] the past. I'm not going to talk about
[52:33] those in the book. The book is not about
[52:35] understanding Bitcoin. It's not about um
[52:39] it's it's actually a book that's written
[52:41] for
[52:42] Bitcoiners about what we are responsible
[52:46] for after we win and what we can choose
[52:50] to do with that and and what that looks
[52:53] like from a philosophical standpoint,
[52:55] from an ethical standpoint. Uh that's
[52:58] that's what I'm writing about. And
[53:00] so I'm not necessarily trying to change
[53:02] anybody's mind, but I'm presenting these
[53:04] arguments and these ways of thinking
[53:07] specifically around integral theory,
[53:08] which is a philosophical framework to to
[53:12] provide some kind of an
[53:15] idea of what I think the future looks
[53:18] like, but not in a central planning way.
[53:20] Most of these futurists that write books
[53:22] about even Buckminister Fuller, I'm
[53:25] listening to critical path right now and
[53:27] he's such a he's got such a heart on for
[53:30] central planning. It's kind of weird,
[53:33] you know? I it's it's like he thinks he
[53:35] has a solution for everything. I don't
[53:37] have a solution for everything, but
[53:39] there's an underlying framework of how
[53:42] people ought to treat each other. Um,
[53:46] and I talk about of course any kind of
[53:47] ought statement is a value proposition
[53:50] that's based on your own assumptions.
[53:52] But
[53:54] um, if we want a peaceful future, right?
[53:58] So that's a value proposition. I do want
[54:00] a peaceful future. I want a peaceful
[54:02] abundant future because my values align
[54:04] with that. If you don't want a peaceful,
[54:06] abundant future, you can go [ __ ]
[54:07] yourself. I'm going to build a giant
[54:09] wall and all those people that that
[54:11] believe that, they can stay on the other
[54:12] side of it, right? And and that's that's
[54:15] kind of the whole point is you you can't
[54:19] get into this fairy tale land of, oh,
[54:21] everybody's going to get along and
[54:24] everything's going to be taken care of
[54:25] and we don't need money and these
[54:27] things, but you also don't want to go
[54:30] into this like hyper vigilant
[54:34] everybody's my enemy mindset. Like both
[54:37] sides can be detrimental, you know? So
[54:39] that's kind of the balance I'm trying to
[54:41] strike with the book. Interesting. Yeah,
[54:44] I I I love that aspect because there are
[54:47] a lot of books out there that that
[54:49] explain why Bitcoin. Uh and we need
[54:52] those books. Definitely. I think we need
[54:54] uh more books. We need more educators in
[54:57] the space because we really just started
[55:00] educating the masses and I think like
[55:03] 99% of population didn't understand
[55:06] Bitcoin even though I think 3% or
[55:09] something like that has exposure to
[55:10] Bitcoin but I think most Bitcoiners
[55:13] haven't understood Bitcoin. Most
[55:14] Bitcoiners have like a€,000 on Coinbase.
[55:17] If you have a€,000 on Coinbase, you
[55:20] haven't understood Bitcoin. you just you
[55:22] just have it because someone else told
[55:24] you or you think it's important to
[55:27] diversify. So
[55:29] everything where we educate other people
[55:33] uh if it's no coiners or bitcoiners or
[55:35] precoiners or whatever it is I think
[55:38] that's valuable. So education is
[55:42] probably outside of developing scaling
[55:46] technology for Bitcoin and developing
[55:49] the infrastructure where everything is
[55:51] running on uh around Bitcoin. Outside of
[55:54] that, education is probably the most
[55:56] important part of of of the next few
[55:59] years for Bitcoin. Yeah, for sure. Um
[56:02] it's it's kind of interesting. I I have
[56:04] this this saying, shitcoiners don't read
[56:06] because they they won't pick up a book.
[56:09] uh myself included, before I understood
[56:11] Bitcoin, I hadn't read any books about
[56:13] it. That was my main flaw. Uh and that's
[56:16] why I got stuck in the crypto casino for
[56:18] a year or two. But um we've kind of
[56:23] reached the critical mass of people who
[56:25] are willing to read books
[56:27] uh outside of the Bitcoin space. I think
[56:29] at least until we get some more NGU
[56:32] because that's the billboard that makes
[56:33] people notice that we need to they need
[56:36] to do research, right?
[56:38] Um, so I I don't see any value added in
[56:42] me trying to explain Bitcoin in a
[56:44] different way. It's been explained in so
[56:46] many different ways by so many different
[56:47] people and many of them are really good
[56:49] to the point where when I'm talking to
[56:51] somebody, I'm orange pilling somebody. I
[56:52] have specific books in mind that it's
[56:54] like, oh, this person is has this
[56:56] political leaning. Okay, let me send
[56:58] them this way or oh, they're this way or
[57:00] they're a gold bug or whatever. I sent
[57:02] them to different books, you know, and
[57:04] um at this point, you make more money by
[57:08] trying to reach a fiat audience for
[57:11] sure, but that's not my intention with
[57:13] this book. Like my my intention is to
[57:16] genuinely connect with other Bitcoiners
[57:19] intellectually so that we can sort of
[57:23] collectively think about and shape what
[57:26] the earth is going to be like over the
[57:29] next thousand years or whatever. you
[57:32] know,
[57:33] um, the ideas that I'm putting in the
[57:35] book are not
[57:38] largely shared in the Bitcoin space
[57:40] because they're about as obscure as
[57:43] Bitcoin is outside of the Bitcoin space.
[57:45] Like this this integral theory thing
[57:47] that I'm writing about, nobody there's
[57:49] I've met a few Bitcoiners that care
[57:50] about integral theory on Nostra. So,
[57:52] it's like, okay, you're a Bitcoiner on
[57:54] Nostra that knows about integral theory.
[57:56] That's a very small that's a very small
[57:59] group of people on this planet, you
[58:01] know, and that's that's what I'm writing
[58:03] the book about. So, uh to to to spread
[58:06] those ideas more
[58:07] widely. Yeah. It's you can make those
[58:11] markers because uh we already it's
[58:15] almost if if you are someone that holds
[58:18] Bitcoin on self custody, runs their own
[58:21] full node and maybe even mines a little
[58:23] bit. uh all all those checkpoints are
[58:26] already very very filtering. But then
[58:29] you add on he also has a nostra or then
[58:33] then you add on he maybe is only on
[58:35] nostra or bromely on on nostra and then
[58:39] you know get get some theories in there
[58:42] what he knows about additionally on
[58:44] that you you crammed down your your
[58:46] niche very very much right yeah exactly
[58:50] but I I think that as the Bitcoin price
[58:53] continues to appreciate
[58:56] uh more and more people are going to be
[58:58] drawn into I think that the the devs on
[59:00] Nostra are really dedicated and they're
[59:02] building new tools to uh do better jobs
[59:06] with zaps and all these things. We had a
[59:08] zap bare market because everybody was
[59:11] afraid of
[59:12] regulation and so like wal Satoshi
[59:15] pulled out of the US. Phoenix pulled out
[59:17] of the US. Phoenix just came back
[59:18] because of the recent legislation. So
[59:21] I'm I'm super bullish on Zaps. I'm super
[59:23] bullish on Nostra. think that
[59:26] um yeah, it's it's going to continue to
[59:30] grow as long as we get left alone uh for
[59:32] long enough. And right now, it's good
[59:36] that it's obscure because we're not
[59:38] ready to be attacked. It's similar to
[59:40] the early Bitcoin days when Satoshi was
[59:43] getting worried about Wikileaks. It was
[59:46] like, yo, this is getting way too much
[59:48] heat too quick. we're not ready for the
[59:52] apparatus that we're opposing to notice
[59:54] us. We need to be subversive for longer.
[59:58] And that was about when he disappeared
[60:00] cuz he was like, I need to get out of
[60:01] here. You know, it was getting
[60:03] dangerous.
[60:04] Um, luckily the apparatus either didn't
[60:07] care or or didn't Oh, my battery's
[60:11] computer's going to die on me. All
[60:13] right, take your time. Take your time. A
[60:15] good good editor. Um, okay, cool.
[60:19] So anyway, yeah, with Noster, we're
[60:21] still vulnerable to attack right now,
[60:23] and we don't have solutions in place to
[60:25] get rid of, for example, a massive bot
[60:28] attack. There was this uh event where
[60:30] somebody spun up a server and attacked
[60:33] Noster kind of as a joke with this thing
[60:35] called Reply Guy, and all it did is it
[60:37] would reply to you saying exactly what
[60:39] you said. It was totally uh
[60:43] non-malicious. It was like just a show
[60:45] of vulnerability. and we struggled to
[60:49] cope with that, you know. So, um, we're
[60:52] not ready for ma mainstream adoption.
[60:54] And the people that are on Nostra that
[60:56] are like, oh, you know, you guys need to
[60:58] stop talking about Bitcoin cuz then no,
[61:00] nobody's going to want to hang out here
[61:01] because you're talking about Bitcoin.
[61:03] It's like, yo, we this was built by
[61:05] Bitcoiners. Bitcoin is the only ones
[61:07] that'll put up with this shitty software
[61:09] long enough to care to be here. You guys
[61:12] can talk about whatever you want. We
[61:14] want to talk about Bitcoin. So, leave me
[61:17] alone. I came here to be left alone.
[61:19] It's like, don't tell me what to say.
[61:21] Don't tell me what not to say, Rabble.
[61:23] Thank you.
[61:26] Yeah, it's it it's always super fun when
[61:29] other people try to control other
[61:30] people. It's It never makes sense.
[61:33] Especially Bitcoiners. Bitcoiners are
[61:35] supposed to be super into freedom and
[61:37] all that and then they like love telling
[61:38] other people what to do.
[61:41] It's don't eat vegetables. Just don't.
[61:45] Vegetables are poison. Don't eat those.
[61:47] I'm I'm I'm so I'm sometimes really
[61:50] annoyed by that because I think we we
[61:52] make the mistake of putting our own
[61:55] values onto Bitcoin and thinking just
[61:58] because I have those values, no matter
[62:00] what this is, let's stick with no
[62:02] vegetables and I'm a carnivore. Um let's
[62:04] put that onto Bitcoin. And now everyone
[62:07] that also understands Bitcoin should not
[62:10] eat vegetables and only one steak a day.
[62:14] Right. I do eat one steak a day for the
[62:16] record, but uh I also started eating
[62:19] vegetables recently because I realized
[62:22] it's ridiculous. Uh they taste good, you
[62:24] know, like broccoli in the oven.
[62:26] Delicious. I love vegetables. They are
[62:28] really good. I like that. I also like
[62:30] fruits and and nuts and and things like
[62:33] that. Too extreme, man. I don't know.
[62:34] Fruit and nuts. I'm just, you know,
[62:38] Yeah. And there's a there's like a
[62:40] purity test and I think that a lot of
[62:42] it's on Twitter. I remember how toxic it
[62:44] was on Twitter. And the first time I
[62:47] went to a conference, I was really
[62:49] worried about meeting Bitcoiners. I was
[62:51] really nervous because I'd had so many
[62:54] negative interactions on Twitter with
[62:56] Bitcoiners, even though we fundamentally
[62:58] agree on like 90% of everything. You
[63:01] know what? It might not just be
[63:02] Bitcoiners. It could just be
[63:03] libertarians in general. Um, I saw this
[63:05] meme that said, it said, "Oh, you're a
[63:08] libertarian now. Welcome to disagreeing
[63:12] with everybody you know even though you
[63:13] align on 99% of everything else. You
[63:16] know libertarians love to argue. I was
[63:20] before I started the podcast I was on
[63:23] Twitter only. So, I had my Twitter
[63:26] account for about a year before I
[63:29] started the podcast and I started with
[63:31] zero followers up until like seven or 8K
[63:34] or something like that. And I
[63:37] was putting daily efforts. So, I put out
[63:40] five, sometimes even 12 tweets out per
[63:43] day that just came in my thoughts and I
[63:46] try to to come up with things. It was
[63:48] really hard um with so much output. So
[63:52] naturally, I really got into the Bitcoin
[63:54] sphere on Twitter and I was really I I I
[63:59] got sucked into that a lot. I got sucked
[64:02] into the the most toxic maxi mindset
[64:06] ever. And then the podcast
[64:10] actually softened me a lot. I I got
[64:13] softened a lot on on altcoins.
[64:16] Previously I said it's it's pure evil
[64:19] and I don't want to touch it. Now I say
[64:21] I don't want to touch it. If you do, you
[64:23] do you. It's your money. Like like I I I
[64:26] I don't say that. I don't think you're
[64:29] making a good decision when you go into
[64:31] altcoins, but you live your life. Like
[64:34] you do you. I I will recommend to you
[64:36] Bitcoin only. And I can give you all the
[64:39] sources and and things why I'm thinking
[64:41] that way, but you do you. I don't I I
[64:44] attacked altcoiners and shitcoiners
[64:47] every single day. I stopped doing that
[64:50] with the podcast because I saw it it
[64:52] doesn't matter and uh in that way bit
[64:56] the podcast made me a little bit more
[64:58] realistic
[65:00] uh around what's what's going on in
[65:02] Bitcoin and talking with people makes a
[65:05] difference and the same way you don't
[65:07] have to start a podcast for for that you
[65:09] just you just can go to a a conference
[65:11] or meet up and you will realize people
[65:14] are actually kind of nice. Yeah. Right.
[65:17] Most of the time it's when they're not
[65:18] behind a computer screen and these
[65:20] people that just stay at home and never
[65:21] go outside. Of course they're upset and
[65:23] they're that's going to come out in the
[65:25] and also Twitter has a way of propping
[65:28] up tweets and engagement that is more
[65:30] adversarial and combative. So I think
[65:33] that I think the algorithm on Twitter
[65:35] has a lot to do with it. But yeah, I got
[65:38] really toxic about [ __ ] coiners. Uh, I
[65:40] still can be, frankly, I' I'd every once
[65:43] in a while meet somebody in person and
[65:45] I've realized it's not about the
[65:46] shitcoining. I I don't care what people
[65:48] do with their money. It's when they come
[65:50] at me with arrogance like they know more
[65:52] than I do or, you know, or they think
[65:54] that they think that whatever. That's
[65:57] what really gets under my skin. And I'm
[65:59] working on that. It's a spiritual
[66:00] journey, you know, like being around
[66:02] arrogant people without getting
[66:03] triggered is is my own my own shadow
[66:06] work to deal with. But I did create on
[66:08] the the lecture series that I put out,
[66:11] the holotropic renaissance. Um there's
[66:14] an episode now, I think I created it
[66:16] since I last spoke to you, that is a
[66:18] recording. It's about an hour long and
[66:20] it's my explanation of exactly why I
[66:23] don't invest in crypto. And now when I
[66:25] get into a discussion with somebody
[66:26] online, I don't engage. I just send them
[66:29] the link. It's like, and it says in the
[66:31] beginning of the recording, it says, "I
[66:33] created this because I don't want to
[66:35] have this discussion anymore. or I've
[66:36] had it hundreds of times. And if you're
[66:38] interested, you can listen to this, but
[66:40] it's totally voluntary. It's up to you.
[66:42] There's there's valuable information in
[66:44] there. I talk about the Byzantine
[66:45] general's problem and like why Bitcoin's
[66:47] network effect is going to crush
[66:49] everything else. I just got a new piece
[66:51] from Sam Hyde, which was um he was
[66:53] talking about the shelling point, which
[66:55] is really good. I might actually go back
[66:57] and add that. Um the shelling point is
[67:00] like people's innate convergence on one
[67:03] solution. uh which just happens in in
[67:06] every part of life and that's what's
[67:08] going to happen with Bitcoin too. So um
[67:11] that resource is out there. I know other
[67:13] people that are sharing it with
[67:14] shitcoiners. It's it's very gentle. It's
[67:17] like not toxic. As best I could do, you
[67:20] know, it it makes a lot of uh a lot of
[67:24] sense. Yeah. Um I think last time I
[67:26] actually did not ask you that. Uh we
[67:28] have now a new question that I ask each
[67:31] and every single guest and maybe I've
[67:33] asked you. I'm I'm not remembering. Um
[67:36] what can we learn from you besides
[67:37] Bitcoin? Oh, right. So, um yeah, the the
[67:42] h the holotropic renaissance lecture
[67:44] series is a collection of everything
[67:46] I've learned in my life that was
[67:49] critically important to me. Um and and
[67:52] so I put that out. It talks about
[67:55] spirituality, psychology, psychedelics,
[67:59] philosophy, uh, and Bitcoin and crypto
[68:02] and the difference between the two. And,
[68:05] um, I created it as a passion project
[68:07] for myself, but I also really created it
[68:09] for the Bitcoin community because I know
[68:11] there's a large curiosity around
[68:15] psychedelics and I and I know that
[68:17] there's a lot of really reckless and
[68:19] irresponsible use of psychedelics in
[68:21] society at large.
[68:23] And uh if I had known the things that I
[68:25] shared in that podcast early on, I would
[68:27] have saved myself a lot of time. I also
[68:30] believe
[68:31] that if Bitcoiners, especially
[68:34] Bitcoiners that have a large holding,
[68:36] understand more about
[68:38] psychedelics, it would probably benefit
[68:41] them and the rest of humanity
[68:44] because of the insights that are
[68:47] commonly associated with uh
[68:49] psychedelics. that you don't necessarily
[68:51] even have to take psychedelics. You can
[68:53] do breath work. You can meditate. Um
[68:56] it's it's not an essential thing and I'm
[68:58] not out here telling people, oh, you
[69:00] should do psychedelics or even even
[69:03] recommending it. Um but it's been
[69:06] incredibly beneficial for me to
[69:08] understand the context in which my I
[69:12] live, right? the the meaning of life and
[69:14] all these huge questions which
[69:16] inevitably if you stack Bitcoin hard
[69:18] enough, you're going to have some time
[69:20] on your hands to think and you're going
[69:22] to want to to consider these questions.
[69:25] Uh at least that was my disposition. So,
[69:29] um that that was a a big part of it for
[69:32] me is like I really wanted to get my
[69:35] thoughts ironed out and then share them.
[69:39] Um, so genuinely that is that that's
[69:41] what other people can learn from me
[69:43] besides Bitcoin. Yeah. The the harder
[69:45] you stack and the longer you do, the the
[69:47] more freedom you get, right? Yeah. And
[69:50] then the question became, what do I
[69:52] actually want to be doing with my life
[69:54] on this planet? And I realized, well,
[69:57] the guys that I look up to, the coolest
[69:59] guys I know are Alan Watts, Roms, uh,
[70:03] Echarolei. And I've had the privilege
[70:07] of, you know, studying those people and
[70:09] learning from them. And now I see
[70:12] that they didn't have everything
[70:14] perfect. Like Ken Wilbur, all these
[70:17] guys, I mean, they Allan Watts is a
[70:19] brilliant man, but he drank himself to
[70:21] death. And he he uh had really
[70:24] tumultuous relationships in his life.
[70:27] And so there is work to be done there
[70:30] that can integrate what they shared and
[70:32] improve to to transcend and include as
[70:35] Ken Wilbur would put it um what was
[70:38] developed before. That's super
[70:41] interesting especially when you think
[70:43] about um what what's after it. We we
[70:46] stack in Bitcoin we
[70:48] early as you said maybe what's what's
[70:51] going on in your book. What are we doing
[70:53] with that? How we how do we deal if
[70:56] Bitcoiners are the elite of the world
[70:58] all of a sudden and not fiat central
[71:01] bankers? Yeah, I I right about the uh
[71:04] lottery problem which is, you know,
[71:08] let's imagine that overnight Bitcoin
[71:09] goes to $20 million for some reason.
[71:12] Yeah. Uh the game theory just happens
[71:15] all at once. Most Bitcoiners are not
[71:18] ready for that
[71:20] reality. If we were, it would happen.
[71:23] That's that would be a spiritual
[71:25] philosophical statement. But uh if we
[71:27] were ready for that, it would be
[71:29] occurring right now. But philos uh uh
[71:32] lottery winners often end up in a worse
[71:35] position 5 years after they win the
[71:38] lottery. And the reason that is is
[71:41] because money doesn't solve all your
[71:44] problems. In fact, it doesn't really
[71:46] solve any of the important problems. So
[71:48] when Bitcoiners say fix the money, fix
[71:50] the world, it's a really good meme.
[71:54] But every human being knows that money
[71:57] doesn't buy anything that's actually
[71:58] important. It doesn't buy your
[72:00] relationship with your parents or your
[72:01] spouse or your kids. It doesn't buy your
[72:04] connection to a higher power. It doesn't
[72:07] fix the environment that you live in
[72:10] necessarily. Uh that takes time and
[72:12] learning and it's a relationship, right?
[72:14] It's a relationship with uh your
[72:17] surroundings and your context and with
[72:18] yourself also. And these things are way
[72:21] more important than money. Um money is
[72:24] just a means to that end in my opinion.
[72:28] And a lot of Bitcoiners seem to be
[72:29] worshiping Bitcoin. Uh making jokes
[72:31] about, you know, the Bitcoin standard
[72:33] being their Bible and about Satoshi
[72:36] being like Jesus. And that's great. I
[72:38] mean, it's a good meme. It's funny. But
[72:41] uh I would caution people not to worship
[72:45] money. That's uh it's all over the
[72:47] Bible. Don't do that. So, you know, this
[72:50] is the way that I tend to think about
[72:52] it. It's a tool in the end of the day.
[72:55] That's very true. Yeah. Um we have an
[72:58] end as you know where the previous guest
[73:00] is asking a question for the next guest
[73:02] without knowing who the next guest
[73:04] actually is. And the previous guest
[73:06] asked you the question, which US tech
[73:09] billionaire will be the first one to
[73:11] adopt Bitcoin in a meaningful way? Uh,
[73:14] yeah, Michael Sailor, I guess, doesn't
[73:15] count.
[73:17] Okay. Jeez. Tech billionaire. So, the
[73:20] only two names that are coming to mind
[73:22] are Bezos and and Musk. Yeah. Is
[73:26] [Music]
[73:27] also Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a tossup,
[73:30] man. I Any one of them, they all have
[73:33] Bitcoin, right? There's they're not
[73:36] talking about it publicly. Why would
[73:37] they? Uh Elon has Bitcoin on the balance
[73:40] sheet at Tesla, so he already has
[73:42] adopted to some degree. I personally
[73:45] wonder if he wouldn't be buying more if
[73:48] it wasn't for his board, right, and the
[73:51] shareholders, but it's not clear to me.
[73:55] Um Zuckerberg has gone through a big
[73:58] transition over the last two years. He's
[74:02] been doing jiu-jitsu. I think he's
[74:04] probably been doing Iwasa. He's changed
[74:06] from like a robotic person into like
[74:08] somebody I would actually hang out with,
[74:10] which is shocking, you know.
[74:13] Um, I would love to see him adopt
[74:15] Bitcoin. I think that would be super
[74:18] bullish. That would be my preference. I
[74:20] would say I would like to see Oh gosh, I
[74:22] would love to see Bezos adopt it, too,
[74:24] because I want to be able to to spend
[74:27] sats on Amazon. So, yeah, I don't really
[74:30] have an answer as far as a prediction
[74:31] goes.
[74:33] any of them seems equally likely and it
[74:36] would surprise me to not see them
[74:39] adopted over the next two years. All all
[74:41] three of those guys I mentioned.
[74:43] Absolutely. Zuckerberg is uh is is I
[74:47] think also the one that has a a gold
[74:50] called Bitcoin. You do you remember
[74:53] that? Right. Yeah. Yeah. He he in I
[74:57] think in uh 201 he posted on Facebook a
[75:01] picture with two goats and he said um
[75:05] here are my two goats max and Bitcoin.
[75:09] Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.
[75:11] There's a lot of sleeper cells out there
[75:13] and uh it could be that these people are
[75:16] not in a position where they want to
[75:19] talk about it publicly for a lot of
[75:22] reasons and it's not really in their um
[75:26] it's not in their advantage to talk
[75:27] about it publicly. They're just going to
[75:28] keep stacking sats. So let's see. Yeah,
[75:31] there's no way they uh any of those. I
[75:33] mean, with Elon, we know like he said
[75:35] publicly that he owns privately also
[75:38] Bitcoin outside of uh the the the Tesla
[75:42] holdings. Uh Bezos, there's no question
[75:46] he has like he has Bitcoin. Like there
[75:49] there's just no question around it. We
[75:50] know um one thing that we I don't know
[75:53] if he's a billionaire actually. Tim Cook
[75:55] uh also publicly said that he has
[75:57] Bitcoin in an interview where he was
[76:00] asked uh if he holds holds crypto and he
[76:03] said yes I have crypto. He said he has
[76:06] Bitcoin Ethereum and I think one or two
[76:08] other ones he mentioned right and
[76:10] Zuckerberg calls his gold Bitcoin. He
[76:13] definitely also has some. Yeah. So I
[76:15] will
[76:17] then Bezos and Zuckerberg self custody
[76:21] and that Tim Cook does not. That would
[76:24] be my guess.
[76:28] That's a that's an interesting question.
[76:30] They all have Bitcoin and who does self
[76:32] custody? Who who runs a node? Does
[76:34] anyone of them run a running? Before I
[76:36] let you go, where can people find you
[76:37] and and ask you questions and yeah,
[76:39] reach out to you? Yeah, so I've got a
[76:41] landing page. It's
[76:43] sourcenode.xyz and you can find me on
[76:47] nostster if you source search source
[76:49] node. Uh that's it. That's the only two
[76:52] places you can find me. I love that. I
[76:54] just uh keep it simple. Simple. I I love
[76:56] the website. I I will just quickly uh
[76:59] show it because I love how it looks. Oh,
[77:02] thanks. It's it's it's like the the exit
[77:04] button here. So, for the people that
[77:06] that just listen, it's basically a
[77:08] website with the Matrix like in in the
[77:10] movie. uh the numbers and the this the
[77:13] characters running down and then a exit
[77:15] button and where you then can exit to to
[77:20] source note.
