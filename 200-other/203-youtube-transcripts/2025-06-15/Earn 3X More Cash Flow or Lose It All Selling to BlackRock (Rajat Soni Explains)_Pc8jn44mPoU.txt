[00:00] It's possible for you to keep your
[00:01] Bitcoin while taking advantage of the
[00:03] current system. It's possible to do that
[00:05] and I think a lot of wealthy people are
[00:07] going to do that. So, if your bills are
[00:08] in fiat and you don't have to sell your
[00:10] Bitcoin, then why would you? In Canada,
[00:12] for example, you can put it in a
[00:14] tax-free savings account where you keep
[00:15] getting cash flows basically forever.
[00:17] You don't pay taxes on it. You can use
[00:19] that money to spend for your life, your
[00:21] living expenses, and now you have your
[00:23] Bitcoin, you have this cash flowing
[00:24] asset, and now you're basically free
[00:26] depending on how much Bitcoin you get,
[00:27] depending on how much Bitcoin you use.
[00:29] If you're selling your Bitcoin into the
[00:30] market, you're not selling it to other
[00:31] people. You're selling it to Black
[00:33] Rockck. You're selling it to Fidelity.
[00:34] And those guys are never going to sell
[00:35] it again. They're going to borrow
[00:36] against their Bitcoin. If you really
[00:37] want cash flow, then you could buy MSTY
[00:40] with a fraction of the amount of money
[00:42] that you would put into real estate and
[00:44] get a way bigger cash flow. When when
[00:46] you own a house, I wouldn't consider
[00:47] that an investment. I would say that
[00:49] that's a it's a liability. Just based on
[00:51] fundamentals, it should be cheaper than
[00:54] borrowing against your real estate.
[00:57] [Music]
[01:00] I I usually don't celebrate uh the the
[01:03] milestones. I did it only with like the
[01:05] 100th episode. Uh I did that one with
[01:08] Gary Kadone. That was that was a lot of
[01:10] fun. The 100th episode with with Gary
[01:13] and uh now the 500th one, it it seems
[01:16] like a milestone. I I have to celebrate
[01:19] a little bit. So I'll take this episode
[01:21] as the 500th one and and to celebrate
[01:24] today a little bit. Um, and yeah, I'm
[01:27] I'm so glad to to have you on as the the
[01:29] 500th guest on my Bitcoin show. Amazing.
[01:32] I'm looking forward to it. This is going
[01:33] to be a good conversation. That's huge.
[01:35] 500 guests. Wow. That's uh No, not
[01:38] sorry, not 500. 500 episodes. That's
[01:40] huge. Yeah, it's almost it's almost 500.
[01:43] It's because I don't have up until now a
[01:45] lot of people again on so it's around
[01:48] like 410 maybe 415 uh guests, something
[01:52] like that. So, it's like almost 500
[01:54] different people. It's a lot of
[01:56] different a lot of different uh people.
[01:58] Um perspectives. A lot of different
[02:01] perspectives on Bitcoin. Perspectives.
[02:03] Yeah. That's crazy. The the range of
[02:05] people who have come on your show like
[02:07] I've seen people who are what an
[02:08] astrophysicist. There's a mathematician.
[02:11] There's are there I've seen I think I've
[02:13] seen physicians like doctors, healthcare
[02:15] workers. Yeah. and and from every walk
[02:18] of life. I I've uh from ages 13 to 76 I
[02:23] think was the oldest one. Uh so like
[02:25] almost every age range that that you can
[02:28] can have. Uh before 13 it will be it is
[02:31] difficult and and after 76 it will al
[02:34] also be difficult. Um but then it's like
[02:37] there's teachers uh there is uh CEOs,
[02:40] there's finance people, uh there is uh
[02:43] people that like like literally
[02:45] carpenters. I had carpenters on. Uh so
[02:48] like literally from everything that you
[02:50] can imagine and having that all in in
[02:52] like kind of one place that's kind of
[02:54] what I did the last year. That's huge. I
[02:58] mean that's congratulations. That's
[02:59] that's huge. Thank you so much Raj. I
[03:02] really appreciate it. And I think uh
[03:03] with you I already had two times. So
[03:05] it's it's it's the third episode of the
[03:07] third anniversary for us.
[03:10] Yes. Great. I enjoyed the the first one
[03:12] already. Um I've I've heard today one
[03:15] question and I I was really never asking
[03:18] that any uh guests before. So I was like
[03:20] let's let's go with Raj on that one. Is
[03:23] there one question or one topic that or
[03:28] like what is the one question or what
[03:30] one topic that you wonder the most about
[03:32] on Bitcoin? So like is there like one
[03:34] thing that is like keep coming back even
[03:36] though you are so far down the orange
[03:38] building journey already and talking so
[03:40] much about Bitcoin? It's like one re
[03:43] reoccurring thing going on for you.
[03:46] Yeah. So, there's one thing that I'm
[03:47] constantly thinking about. I'm actually
[03:49] making a video about it for my own
[03:50] channel. I'm working on it right now.
[03:51] But, there's one thing that I keep
[03:52] talking about, keep thinking about, and
[03:54] it's whether you should borrow against
[03:56] your Bitcoin. So, I've been thinking
[03:58] about it for a really long time. I've
[03:59] talked about it before. I've always said
[04:00] you shouldn't borrow against your
[04:01] Bitcoin because it's too volatile. Uh,
[04:03] it could drop in value by 50% over a few
[04:06] weeks. I mean, that could happen. Nobody
[04:08] can say that that's not going to happen.
[04:09] it could drop 70 80% in a year. I don't
[04:12] think that's going to happen, but it's
[04:14] always a possibility. You can't say
[04:16] that's not going to happen. So, the way
[04:18] that I see it, if you're borrowing
[04:19] against your Bitcoin and Bitcoin drops
[04:22] by I think it has to drop by something
[04:25] like 75% for you to be completely
[04:27] liquidated because you have a loan to
[04:29] value of a certain amount. Uh, no,
[04:31] sorry, not completely liquidated, but
[04:32] the majority of your Bitcoin is
[04:33] liquidated. So if you let's say for
[04:35] example if you take your entire stack
[04:37] and you borrow against it you're putting
[04:39] yourself at a massive risk because
[04:41] Bitcoin could have some scam wick down
[04:44] price drops temporarily you lose
[04:46] everything and then it comes right back
[04:48] up. So you could lose everything in that
[04:49] case. So the what I've been thinking
[04:51] about more recently is instead of
[04:53] borrowing against your entire stack, I
[04:56] think it would be I think it could be
[04:57] very lucrative to borrow against a small
[05:00] amount of your stack, borrow some fiat
[05:03] against it because eventually the the
[05:05] the value of your stack is going to
[05:07] grow. You'll be able to pay back the
[05:09] debt with the increased value. You can
[05:11] take on another loan. You can do all
[05:13] that stuff over time. The interest rates
[05:15] on these loans is going to decrease. And
[05:17] then what you could do is potentially
[05:20] buy a cash flowing asset where you use
[05:24] the cash flow. I mean, I've I don't
[05:25] really care about cash flow personally,
[05:27] but you could use the cash flow to pay
[05:28] back the loan. Let's say, for example,
[05:31] um there's this one stock that people
[05:33] talk about uh from YieldMax, MSTY. It's
[05:37] a yield
[05:38] ETF. What you could do is let's say uh
[05:41] so it gives you something like an 80%
[05:43] dividend per year. It's crazy. It goes
[05:45] based on Micro Strategies volatility. So
[05:48] the more volatile Micro Strategy is, the
[05:49] more of a yield MSTY can give you. So
[05:52] what you could do is you borrow against
[05:54] let's say you you use 5% of your stack
[05:57] as
[05:59] collateral. You put that into you you
[06:02] give that to a lender. You have to give
[06:04] your Bitcoin to a lender. Then you
[06:05] borrow 50% against that 5%. So
[06:08] technically, if you, let's say, have
[06:10] $100,000 of Bitcoin, you're borrowing
[06:14] $2,500 against that $100,000. You have
[06:18] 5% in collateral. You're borrowing half
[06:20] of that collateral. And then you can buy
[06:22] MSTY within a year. I'm not I'm not I'm
[06:25] not telling you that this is going to
[06:26] happen. I don't know for your audience.
[06:28] I don't know if this is going to happen.
[06:29] For all we know, MSTY could fail. For
[06:32] all we know, your lender could fail.
[06:33] There are a lot of issues that you have
[06:35] to take you have you have to know about.
[06:37] Let's say you give your Bitcoin to a
[06:39] lender. The government says that this
[06:41] lender is not able to give you your
[06:43] Bitcoin back. So you may not get that
[06:44] Bitcoin back ever again. These are
[06:47] things you have to consider and
[06:48] Bitcoin's price could drop. You could
[06:49] lose that Bitcoin that collateral. But
[06:51] what you could do is you could buy MSTY
[06:53] and you can in the time being when the
[06:55] dividends come in, you can pay back that
[06:56] loan. So eventually if you let's say you
[07:01] take down let's say you take a 2.5% loan
[07:03] against your Bitcoin you buy MSTY you
[07:05] get the dividends let's say 70 80% in a
[07:08] year like I said I don't know if that's
[07:09] going to continue forever but you can
[07:11] use that dividend pay back the loan take
[07:13] back your Bitcoin and now you have this
[07:17] cash generating asset plus you have your
[07:19] Bitcoin back your stack is whole plus
[07:22] you have this cash generating asset in
[07:24] your accounts. You can also and and then
[07:26] on top of that you can in Canada for
[07:27] example you can put it in a taxfree
[07:29] savings account where you keep getting
[07:31] cash flows basically forever. You don't
[07:34] pay taxes on it. You can use that money
[07:36] to spend for your life your living
[07:38] expenses and now you have your Bitcoin.
[07:42] You have this cash flowing asset and now
[07:43] you're basically free depending on how
[07:45] much Bitcoin you get. Depending on how
[07:46] much Bitcoin you use, you could reinvest
[07:49] all of the dividends that you get from
[07:50] MSTY right back into MSTY. But like I
[07:53] said again again this is something I
[07:54] have to say over and over again because
[07:56] people just they take this the wrong
[07:59] way. MSTY could fail. The strategy could
[08:02] fail. You could lose that 5% of Bitcoin
[08:04] that you use as collateral. You have to
[08:06] remember this. This is very important.
[08:08] You have to put this you have to get
[08:10] this through your head. Don't go and
[08:12] borrow against 100% of your stack. Buy
[08:15] MSTY cuz let's say MSTY fails. Then
[08:19] Bitcoin starts falling. something
[08:21] happens where you lose your entire stack
[08:23] and now you're now you have zero
[08:24] Bitcoin. So, use this cautiously, but
[08:27] this is something I've been thinking
[08:28] about. I don't know if this is the right
[08:29] way to go. Um, yeah, give me your what
[08:33] are your thoughts on that? That's uh
[08:35] that's amazing. I I thought about that a
[08:39] lot. Um because I'm in the special
[08:42] situation that I earn in Bitcoin and I
[08:46] earn actually the majority of my income
[08:48] in Bitcoin
[08:49] directly and only a small portion of my
[08:53] expenses I can pay directly in Bitcoin.
[08:55] It's just like one freelancer that I pay
[08:57] in Bitcoin. So let I haven't done the
[09:00] full analysis but let's say around 70% I
[09:03] get in Bitcoin and let's say around 10%
[09:05] I pay in Bitcoin. um or maybe it's 20%
[09:09] something like that. And this
[09:12] naturally brings me to make a decision.
[09:15] Either I sell my Bitcoin to cover fiat
[09:18] bills or I borrow against the Bitcoin to
[09:21] cover my fiat bills. Either way, I have
[09:23] to get fiat to cover the the the fiat
[09:26] bills somehow because I'm already 100%
[09:29] in Bitcoin. So, there's no fiat stack
[09:32] that I can go back to.
[09:34] Um, and I wondered about that question
[09:38] so long. And now, so just for now, I
[09:42] said to myself, I want to use Bitcoin as
[09:46] intended, as money. So, I will just try
[09:50] to get a little bit more sats every
[09:52] month. I want to be cash flow positive.
[09:55] Um, and that's all I care about. and
[09:59] I'll just sell the Bitcoin that I got to
[10:02] and that I need to to to uh pay my my
[10:06] fiat bills and that's it. And as soon as
[10:09] I took that decision, I was extremely
[10:12] relieved like no doubt. I just have a
[10:16] little bit more Satoshi's each month
[10:18] like and I have my savings account with
[10:20] Bitcoin and I can fully focus on
[10:25] creating the best podcast I can possibly
[10:27] create and that's it. I have time for my
[10:29] family. I have time for the podcast and
[10:32] I have this this this calmness and this
[10:34] this sin in my life and I know because
[10:38] I've talked with so many people on the
[10:39] podcast about that that financial
[10:42] engineering does make sense. So, like
[10:44] making like MSDY, doing borrowing
[10:47] against your Bitcoin, taking out a loan
[10:50] financially, it 100% makes sense. I just
[10:53] don't want to do it
[10:54] emotionally, if you get what I'm saying.
[10:56] I get Yeah, I get what you're I
[10:58] completely get what you're saying. It's
[10:59] like if you wanted to pay back your
[11:00] mortgage versus buying, let's say, in in
[11:03] an index fund, your mortgage could be at
[11:05] 3% interest. The index fund may be
[11:07] paying you 7% or 10% or whatever. people
[11:10] will still go with paying back the
[11:12] mortgage early because they want that
[11:14] freedom of not having debt. And that
[11:16] completely makes sense. I I get it. I'm
[11:18] not I'm not judging you on that at all.
[11:21] Um I do think that this is something
[11:23] that people should look into. I think I
[11:26] was looking at it the wrong way before.
[11:27] I had thought I was thinking exactly the
[11:29] same way that you are. So I was thinking
[11:31] just have a little bit more Bitcoin in
[11:33] the future. Just have a little bit more
[11:34] Bitcoin. Sell some Bitcoin, pay for your
[11:36] expenses, you're good to go. You have a
[11:38] little bit more Bitcoin every single
[11:39] month. you're
[11:40] secure. The issue is
[11:43] that I don't know how many people I
[11:46] don't know if the masses are gonna
[11:47] figure this thing out. I think the price
[11:49] is just going to go up because Micro
[11:51] like think about it since so I was
[11:53] looking at the numbers since January of
[11:55] 2024 Micro Strategy has bought
[11:58] 380,000
[12:00] Bitcoin. So 380,000 Bitcoin. Anything
[12:03] that So you receive Bitcoin, you sell
[12:05] it.
[12:07] You never know, maybe 50% of it is going
[12:09] into Micro Strategies wallets, right?
[12:11] So, if they're taking advantage of this,
[12:14] I feel like it would be reasonable to
[12:15] take advantage of it because over time,
[12:17] think think about it this way. You can
[12:18] keep rolling over your loan.
[12:20] You're you're still getting cash flow.
[12:23] It's not like you're not getting cash
[12:24] flow, right? And then you create cash
[12:27] out of your Bitcoin. You basically turn
[12:28] your Bitcoin into cash in a way. I mean,
[12:30] I I get what you're saying. I'm not
[12:31] saying that you shouldn't do what you're
[12:33] doing. I'm just saying that it's
[12:35] possible for you to keep your Bitcoin
[12:36] while taking advantage of the current
[12:38] system like the financial engineering
[12:39] that you were talking about. It's
[12:40] possible to do that and I think a lot of
[12:43] wealthy people are going to do that,
[12:46] right? They're not going to sell that
[12:47] Bitcoin. So, the Bitcoin that you're
[12:49] selling, you might not be able to get it
[12:51] back, right? You're getting paid, of
[12:53] course,
[12:54] but you could have more Bitcoin over
[12:56] time, right? If Bitcoin goes where, Keep
[12:59] in mind, I'm coming from the perspective
[13:01] where if Bitcoin goes where we think it
[13:03] will, we don't we're not even gonna need
[13:06] like
[13:07] 0.1, right? We're not even going to need
[13:09] I think at some point we are not even
[13:11] going to need like a million Satoshi's
[13:13] because Bitcoin's value is just going to
[13:15] keep increasing and increasing. But
[13:16] that's the part of the reason why the
[13:18] value is going to keep increasing in
[13:19] terms of dollars, in terms of just
[13:21] purchasing power is because people are
[13:25] going to borrow against their Bitcoin.
[13:26] So, think about it this way. If I go and
[13:29] take a loan against my Bitcoin, keep in
[13:30] mind I'm still in the thinking phase of
[13:31] this. I still want to look at the
[13:33] downsides, the upsides. If I go and take
[13:36] a loan against my Bitcoin and basically
[13:37] creating fiat out of nothing and I'm
[13:40] putting it, let's say I use it to buy
[13:41] more
[13:42] Bitcoin, I'm using it to increase the
[13:45] amount of collateral that I have. I'm
[13:47] decreasing my loan to val uh loan to
[13:49] value if I give it back to the lender.
[13:51] And that way, I can survive even longer.
[13:53] I never have to sell my Bitcoin. Or if I
[13:55] need to, like I said, the MSTY way of
[13:57] doing it, I can go and hold on to
[14:02] MSTY, get a certain amount of cash flow
[14:05] every single month, not have to sell
[14:06] that amount of Bitcoin, and I just hold
[14:08] on to it. And in a way, this is
[14:09] benefiting the Bitcoin network. It's
[14:11] almost like when we when we hear with
[14:14] Mic uh with Micro Strategy saying it,
[14:16] it's a speculative attack on fiat. A lot
[14:18] of people say that Micro Strategy is
[14:20] doing that. And I think this is a way of
[14:21] doing your own almost mini speculative
[14:24] attack. That's super interesting because
[14:27] so what you're saying is kind of the
[14:29] green is such a unique
[14:31] situation that it would be almost
[14:33] unreasonable not to explore this uh
[14:37] option that we have and join Micro
[14:40] Strategy and so many other companies
[14:42] already in doing the speculative attack
[14:45] on on the fiat system.
[14:49] Yeah. Yeah, I because if what you're
[14:52] what what's happening here is no matter
[14:54] what the amount of fiat in the system is
[14:56] going to keep increasing. We know that
[14:57] the price of Bitcoin is going to keep
[14:59] increasing. So I p I I agree with you.
[15:02] Keep in mind let's let's look at it from
[15:03] the other side of things. I agree with
[15:05] you. You should pay for value with
[15:07] value. If you if somebody wants to
[15:09] accept Bitcoin, then you shouldn't pay
[15:10] them with Bitcoin. But the majority of
[15:12] people don't want Bitcoin. I think the
[15:14] majority of people are going to keep
[15:15] ignoring it. Right? So, if your bills
[15:17] are in fiat and you don't have to sell
[15:19] your Bitcoin, then why would
[15:22] you, right? And then that way you have
[15:25] um and then that way you don't have to
[15:27] pay you don't have to pay taxes. You
[15:28] don't have to pay capital gains taxes on
[15:29] your Bitcoin. But I assuming your
[15:30] capital gains taxes won't be too high
[15:32] because you're you're receiving and
[15:34] you're selling it within the same
[15:35] period. So, your capital gains taxes
[15:37] won't be too high. Um I can see both
[15:39] sides of it. I can see both sides. I
[15:42] there's I would personally want to be
[15:44] paid in Bitcoin. The only issue is that
[15:46] not many people have Bitcoin right now.
[15:48] And I feel like a lot of people are just
[15:49] ignoring it. So if you're selling your
[15:51] Bitcoin into the market, you're not
[15:52] selling it to other people. You're
[15:54] selling it to BlackRock. You're selling
[15:56] it to Fidelity. And those guys are never
[15:58] going to sell it again. They're going to
[15:59] borrow against their Bitcoin. They're
[16:00] basically going to use the same strategy
[16:02] that we want to avoid. And keep in mind,
[16:04] I was thinking exactly the same way that
[16:06] you were before. They want to use the
[16:08] same strategy that we are we wanted to
[16:10] avoid or that you want to avoid now that
[16:12] I wanted to avoid before. they're going
[16:14] to be using that same strategy against
[16:15] us.
[16:17] Was there some trigger moment that made
[16:20] you realize or like that's why I have to
[16:22] dis explore this opportunity? I think I
[16:24] watched a video from somebody who was I
[16:27] think I watched a video from um from
[16:29] Matthew Crder. He had a video about uh
[16:32] he was talking about the downsides and
[16:34] the upsides of Bitcoin University. He
[16:36] was talking about the upsides and
[16:37] downsides of
[16:39] um of borrowing against your Bitcoin. He
[16:43] said in general you probably shouldn't
[16:44] right now because it's too volatile. Uh
[16:46] I think he was saying that he would
[16:48] borrow against his Bitcoin when it hits
[16:50] a million dollars or something like
[16:51] that. And I think that makes sense cuz
[16:54] at that point the value has gone so up
[16:56] it's it's gone up so high that you can
[16:58] actually pay for your expenses with
[16:59] three 4% of your stack. I'm always
[17:02] curious also like what are the the
[17:05] safety zones. So for me it's one it's
[17:09] very clear that you should not do it
[17:10] with like 100% of your stack
[17:13] because it's just so volatile. Yeah. And
[17:16] it would be very risky to do it with
[17:18] like everything. And um I think one
[17:21] maybe important note is like strategy B
[17:25] has a a lot more different opportunities
[17:28] and unique possibilities to do that than
[17:32] the regular Joe with just like one
[17:33] income, one job like job like um like us
[17:37] like we we cannot do the same thing as
[17:39] such a huge company. Um but we can do
[17:42] similar things and and maybe explore
[17:44] this a little bit. So I think on a
[17:47] personal level you have to really go
[17:50] deep on like what are the safety zones
[17:52] like with how many bitcoin do you want
[17:54] to do it like with how many uh uh what
[17:57] the what is the percentage of your stack
[17:59] that you really want to explore this
[18:01] opportunity uh or not explore this
[18:03] opportunity. So that's that's really
[18:05] interesting for me and I'm I I just came
[18:08] to that calmness moment where I'm like
[18:10] okay I don't I don't I don't want to do
[18:12] deal with that currently just because
[18:14] maybe there's so much going on with the
[18:16] podcast and conferences. I'm almost uh
[18:19] at one point I don't know 1.3
[18:21] conferences the next six six seven
[18:23] months. So I'm allowed on conferences.
[18:26] Um so I'm like okay I don't want to have
[18:28] another open work for me. And this is
[18:32] maybe an interesting point. Um, you do
[18:35] have to do your own research on that.
[18:37] Like I think it's it's not something
[18:38] that you're like, "Oh, I quickly look
[18:40] over it. I open it and I'm good to go."
[18:43] I think it's something that you have to
[18:45] uh observe and that you have to keep
[18:48] observing. It's a it's an it's a small
[18:51] active work uh for for me. Do you do you
[18:54] also see it like that? Yeah. Yeah. I
[18:55] completely agree. You have to do the
[18:56] research. You have to figure out what's
[18:58] happening. Um, you have to make sure
[19:00] that you don't panic sell. Let's say,
[19:01] for example, Micro Strategy crashes,
[19:03] MSDY will probably fall. You don't want
[19:06] to panic panic sell your your your
[19:08] holdings. That's one of the keys. Um,
[19:11] same thing with Bitcoin. I mean, it's
[19:13] all the same stuff, right? It applies
[19:14] the same way. If you panic sell your
[19:16] Bitcoin when the price comes down,
[19:17] you're going to feel stupid, right? But
[19:21] the the downside here, again, like we
[19:24] said here, it could be confiscated. uh
[19:26] the price could go down, you could lose
[19:28] your Bitcoin. That's a problem. Of
[19:30] course, you have to make sure that you
[19:32] understand how the loans work. So, I
[19:34] have actually I have a spreadsheet here
[19:36] that I want to show you guys. Um can I
[19:38] can I share it? Absolutely. Of course.
[19:41] Perfect. Okay. One second here. Let me
[19:43] try to open
[19:45] it. Oh, there it is. Okay. So, Oh, stop
[19:49] sharing. There you go. Let me fix that.
[19:50] That's a lot of Robins.
[19:52] Let me share that. Let me fix that.
[19:54] There. There you go. That should
[19:56] work. Good. Okay. So, when you when you
[20:01] borrow against your Bitcoin, this is
[20:04] just a a quick spreadsheet here that
[20:06] just shows you what your loan to value
[20:08] would be. So, when you borrow against
[20:09] your Bitcoin, you have a certain loan to
[20:11] value that you can take on. So, the loan
[20:13] to value is basically the amount that
[20:14] you borrow divided by the Bitcoin value
[20:17] that you
[20:18] hold. So, with in general with most
[20:21] lenders, I think they'll give you like a
[20:22] 50% loan to value. So they'll let you
[20:24] borrow 50% of whatever the Bitcoin they
[20:27] have with them as collateral. So in this
[20:29] case, I'm going to get rid of this. This
[20:31] is irrelevant. So in this case, what you
[20:33] would have to make sure of is that your
[20:34] loan to value doesn't go to 80%. If your
[20:37] loan to value goes to 80%, they'll start
[20:39] selling your Bitcoin. So what this means
[20:41] is if Bitcoin's value drops, let's say
[20:43] it drops to 20,000. Let's say it drops
[20:46] to 20,000. Your loan to value, so if the
[20:50] collateral value that you have drops by
[20:52] 33%, your loan to value has dropped to
[20:54] 75%. So now you have two options. Either
[20:57] you
[20:58] can top up your Bitcoin. Let's say you
[21:01] only have 5% of your stack in here. You
[21:04] can add another little bit of Bitcoin.
[21:05] You can bring it back to 50%. Let's say
[21:07] you add another $10,000 worth of
[21:08] Bitcoin. You bring it back to $30,000,
[21:10] your collateral. then you bring your LTV
[21:13] back down to 50 or back down to 50%. Or
[21:17] you could let the lender sell some
[21:19] Bitcoin and cover some of your debt and
[21:21] bring your LTV back down. I would
[21:24] personally say because you're only
[21:27] borrowing a very small amount of your uh
[21:30] you're you're borrowing a very small
[21:32] amount of your stack, you can probably
[21:33] put more money into it. But then there's
[21:35] the other side of things where if you
[21:37] decrease how much money you borrow, you
[21:40] also decrease your loan to value. So
[21:41] let's say for example, you buy MSTY. You
[21:44] borrow $15,000 worth of um worth of
[21:48] Bitcoin or of dollars and then you buy
[21:51] MSTY with them. Let's say you get like a
[21:54] just to be conservative, let's say you
[21:56] get a 5% dividend every month. 5%
[21:58] dividend would mean that you get $750.
[22:01] So in that case, this would drop to
[22:04] $14,250. Your loan to value has dropped.
[22:06] Then the following month, this would
[22:08] drop to
[22:09] $13,500. Your loan to value has dropped
[22:11] even more. But then at the same time,
[22:14] let's say the Bitcoin value increases. I
[22:16] personally think that Bitcoin's value is
[22:18] going to increase $30,000. Let's say it
[22:20] goes to $40,000. So the collateral that
[22:22] you have, so Bitcoin's price rises by
[22:24] 30%. Now your loan to value is 34%. So
[22:28] you have borrowed 13,500 because you
[22:31] paid back 1,500. Your Bitcoin value has
[22:33] increased. The collateral that you have
[22:35] has increased. And now because the
[22:38] lender will be willing to give you a 50%
[22:41] loan to value, you can
[22:44] see that uh let's see here. Okay. So it
[22:48] would be
[22:49] 16%
[22:52] equals this
[22:55] times this. So this is the additional
[22:57] loan that you'd be able to get. So you
[23:00] can now increase your uh it should be a
[23:03] little bit more. It should be uh 6,500.
[23:05] But this is the additional loan that you
[23:07] can because the Bitcoin that you used as
[23:08] collateral has increased in value. You
[23:10] can now borrow more against
[23:12] it. I think this is the crazy part. This
[23:15] is the thing that let me let me stop
[23:18] sharing. But this is the thing that I
[23:20] think differentiates Bitcoin from the
[23:22] legacy financial system. And I think
[23:24] this is what's going to really make
[23:25] Bitcoin explode. But of course, there's
[23:28] that downside where if Bitcoin's value
[23:30] goes down, your Bitcoin could be sold.
[23:32] But the upside is also massive
[23:36] because you could keep increasing the
[23:38] amount of money that you borrow, right?
[23:40] So, let's say Oh, go ahead. I I just
[23:42] want to um address two things, but but
[23:46] uh you can you can uh finish your
[23:48] thoughts. Oh, no, no. I'm good. That
[23:51] that's it. Oh, okay. because um there's
[23:54] two things that I like I made uh videos
[23:58] around that sometimes and the two things
[24:02] that I always see popping up in the
[24:04] comments is the interest rates are
[24:06] currently too high on most of the
[24:08] consumer products out there um like a
[24:11] strategy can have like a 0.1% or like
[24:14] zero zero interest rate and then you get
[24:17] out on some of the platforms and you're
[24:19] like it's 8% it's 12% sometimes even
[24:23] like 15% of interest rates. And the the
[24:26] second uh uh comment that I get a lot is
[24:29] I don't want to give up the control of
[24:31] my Bitcoin. Like that's like I I never
[24:34] want to give my keys to anyone else and
[24:38] and put those those Bitcoin at risk at
[24:41] all because there was sales, there was
[24:43] FTX, there was so many other uh examples
[24:45] of that in in the past. Yeah, I agree. I
[24:49] agree with both. I wouldn't want to I
[24:51] wouldn't want to borrow at let's say
[24:52] some if somebody's giving you a loan at
[24:54] 18% why would you want to borrow against
[24:56] your Bitcoin at 18%. Um I think that the
[24:59] loans should be cheaper. Part of the
[25:02] reason why they're so expensive right
[25:03] now is because there's not as many
[25:04] competitors. So let's say for example if
[25:07] uh JP Morgan starts custodying your
[25:09] Bitcoin and giving you loans against it,
[25:11] they're a massive competitor. They're
[25:14] going to compete with uh they're going
[25:16] to compete with the companies that exist
[25:17] today. So, the companies that exist
[25:19] today, they have a head start. They have
[25:21] a better um they have a better base.
[25:24] They can make a massive amount of
[25:25] profit. I mean, I'm assuming that if
[25:27] they're lending to you at 18%, they're
[25:29] making a massive profit. If they're
[25:30] lending to you at 12%, they're still
[25:31] making a profit. So, let's say if JP
[25:35] Morgan comes and says, "We're going to
[25:36] lend it to you at 12%." Then somebody
[25:39] else comes and says that they're going
[25:41] to lend it to you at uh 9%. then
[25:43] somebody else drops it to 7% then 6%
[25:47] because the because the way that I see
[25:49] it Bitcoin is better collateral than
[25:51] real estate. So with real estate the
[25:54] reason why you have let's say 6% loans
[25:56] is because there is still a risk to the
[25:58] lender. If the lender needs to liquidate
[26:01] your property then they may have trouble
[26:03] doing so in the time that they first of
[26:06] all there's no there it's very difficult
[26:07] to sell properties. It takes time may
[26:09] take you like three four five months to
[26:11] sell a property. So in that time the
[26:13] market could completely shift because of
[26:14] that the lender needs to save
[26:16] themselves. So if the value of the
[26:18] property falls they may not be able to
[26:20] get back their money. On the other hand
[26:21] with Bitcoin they can sell your Bitcoin
[26:23] within minutes within seconds. They can
[26:26] just sell it. They can put it into their
[26:27] own they can just take it to cover your
[26:29] loan. So to them there's not really that
[26:32] much of a risk. For example, I've seen l
[26:35] uh lending platforms that allow you to
[26:36] pay back your loan in Bitcoin. you can
[26:38] pay back by giving them the Bitcoin
[26:42] amount that the loan would convert to.
[26:46] So, let's say you take out a $10,000
[26:48] loan, you can pay them 0.1 Bitcoin and
[26:50] your loan is cleared, right? So, they
[26:53] want your Bitcoin right now because real
[26:56] estate is the most widely accepted store
[26:58] of value, the thing that everybody
[27:00] accepts as having value. Loans on real
[27:03] estate are low. I think Bitcoin loans
[27:05] can be much lower because there's going
[27:06] to be more competition. people will be
[27:08] able to give you I I think there's going
[27:11] to be a lot more individuals who can
[27:13] give you loans on Bitcoin, right?
[27:16] Instead of just being able to go to
[27:17] these financial institutions to borrow
[27:19] against your Bitcoin, people can lend
[27:20] you their own fiat
[27:22] currency in exchange for your Bitcoin.
[27:25] If they don't want to sell it, let's
[27:26] say, um there are people who the way
[27:29] that I see it, you don't really need
[27:30] index funds. You don't need you don't
[27:32] really need real need real estate. All
[27:34] you need is cash and Bitcoin. You don't
[27:37] need all the other assets. Your cash is
[27:38] going to protect you in the short term.
[27:40] If we think bit, if Bitcoin goes where
[27:42] we think it will, that Bitcoin will
[27:44] protect you over the long term, right?
[27:46] So, the people who just hold cash, let's
[27:47] say you have 3 years worth of cash and
[27:51] you want to protect yourself for 3
[27:52] years. You don't want to have to sell
[27:54] your Bitcoin. You only need, let's say,
[27:56] a couple months worth of cash on hand.
[27:58] You could lend 2 years and 8 months
[28:01] worth of cash to somebody else. You can
[28:02] use the Bitcoin as collateral, let them
[28:04] use the cash and they can pay you back
[28:06] over time. To you, it doesn't really
[28:07] make a difference because you'll need
[28:09] the cash in the future at some point,
[28:10] but on top of that, you get a amount of
[28:13] interest on your cash. Get what I'm
[28:17] saying? So, you get the liquidity
[28:20] where sorry, you you give away the
[28:22] liquidity where you don't need it, but
[28:24] you also get the best collateral in the
[28:26] world. So, I think that this is going to
[28:28] make a lot more competition. It's going
[28:31] to create a lot more competition for
[28:33] people to loan fiat against
[28:36] Bitcoin. Fiat will continue. I I I don't
[28:39] know. The way that I see it, again, keep
[28:41] in mind that this this really only works
[28:44] if people are willing to accept fiat.
[28:47] Like I said, like I said before, the
[28:49] masses haven't figured it out. They're
[28:51] not going to figure it out. I think
[28:52] they're going to be forced into it. And
[28:54] then by that point, Bitcoin will just be
[28:56] money. We won't be able to loan. uh we
[28:58] won't be able to lend uh we won't be
[29:00] able to borrow against our Bitcoin
[29:01] anymore at that point. But before that,
[29:03] I think this works. I think it works
[29:05] pretty well. So over time, the way that
[29:06] I see it, competition is going to
[29:08] increase. More people are going to come
[29:10] into this lending space and the interest
[29:11] rates are going to fall. That's that's
[29:13] that's question number one answered.
[29:16] Question number two, you said uh people
[29:18] want to take self custody of their
[29:20] Bitcoin. I agree. Completely agree. I
[29:23] want to do that too. I want to keep self
[29:25] custody of my Bitcoin. That's why I say
[29:28] only borrow against 5% of your stack. If
[29:31] you borrow against 5%, you borrow that
[29:34] money, you use it to buy cash flowing
[29:37] assets, and then you can use that cash
[29:38] basically forever. You can keep using
[29:40] that cash forever. You can pay back the
[29:42] loan. You can get back your Bitcoin. I
[29:43] get I get the I get the concern there. I
[29:47] I'm not discounting it, but I think it
[29:50] depends on how much of your stack you're
[29:51] borrowing against. If you're borrowing
[29:53] against your entire stack, that's very
[29:54] risky. But if your borrowing is let's
[29:56] say a very small amount of your
[29:58] stack, go with a reputable lender. You
[30:03] can choose whether you want custodies
[30:06] custody assets or not. You can choose
[30:09] whether they can lend your Bitcoin out
[30:10] to other people or not. You can pay a
[30:13] little bit of a higher interest rate by
[30:14] doing that. You can decrease your your
[30:17] risk, increase your uh the chances that
[30:20] you get your Bitcoin back. And I I think
[30:22] that's the key here. I think it's risk
[30:24] management, right? If you borrow against
[30:25] your entire stack, you could lose
[30:26] everything, you could have it
[30:28] confiscated, but if you borrow against a
[30:29] very small amount of your stack, again,
[30:31] this is going to take some time, right?
[30:32] You probably have to hold your Bitcoin
[30:34] for at least four, five, six years
[30:36] before you can borrow against it. Yeah.
[30:37] It's it's also interesting to note that
[30:41] we are super early to Bitcoin. Yeah. And
[30:43] we are even more early to borrowing
[30:46] against your Bitcoin. And I like the
[30:48] comparison with real estate because if
[30:50] we
[30:51] compare the collateral asset of Bitcoin
[30:55] versus the collateral asset of real
[30:57] estate, Bitcoin is 100x better. But
[31:02] there are better products and better
[31:04] offers for the same thing for real
[31:06] estate. Yeah. And I don't get that. It's
[31:09] like why? People don't get it yet.
[31:12] People don't understand Bitcoin. That's
[31:14] that's simply it. Like people don't
[31:15] understand Bitcoin. Once they understand
[31:17] it, they're going to know that this is
[31:18] better collateral. I think that's the
[31:20] what you said there, exactly what it is.
[31:23] Bitcoin is way better as collateral, but
[31:24] there are better products for real
[31:25] estate. If you can borrow against your
[31:27] real estate for 6%, why would you want
[31:29] to borrow against your Bitcoin for 13
[31:32] 14%. And I think that's the point when
[31:35] the interest rates are better than real
[31:38] estate because they should be and you
[31:41] maybe have a multisix setup where
[31:44] there's uh three parties and you're one
[31:47] of them. So you always hold one key uh
[31:50] and you still have kind of like a part
[31:53] control of of the keys and you see at
[31:55] least like onchain or like oh there are
[31:57] my bitcoin oh now they moved and stuff
[31:59] like that and you're like part of that
[32:01] story that could be really interesting
[32:03] of like being part of a multi- signature
[32:06] setup and getting a competitive rate but
[32:09] for that I think we we still need some
[32:10] time I I don't I don't see the product
[32:12] yet. Yeah, you could you could do that,
[32:14] but it'll cost you more, right? Because
[32:16] you have to set up the multi- signal
[32:17] that stuff. I I don't know what the
[32:18] interest rates on that would be. I think
[32:20] that would be higher because there's
[32:21] probably going to be higher uh fees to
[32:23] start up the the contract. Like with
[32:26] this one, if you just send them your the
[32:28] whether I was what I was looking at, if
[32:30] you just send them your Bitcoin, um they
[32:32] give you the fiat within I think 1 to 3
[32:35] days, I think it was.
[32:37] And over time, let's say if you want to,
[32:40] you basically keep that Bitcoin. And
[32:41] then if you want to roll it over, you
[32:43] can roll it over. Um, you can basically
[32:45] pay back your old loan and start a new
[32:47] loan. Yeah, I think it'll get better
[32:48] over time. Like 10 years from now, it's
[32:50] going to be way better. We know that for
[32:53] sure, right? Because more people are
[32:54] going to have Bitcoin. 99% of the supply
[32:56] will have been mined. So, it's just
[32:58] going to get better. It's not going to
[32:59] get worse. Let's say right now it's at
[33:01] 13%. Maybe it'll go to 10%, then 11, 9,
[33:05] sorry, 10%, then 9, 8. It'll keep
[33:07] dropping. I think it ha just based on
[33:10] fundamentals it should be cheaper than
[33:12] borrowing against your real estate the
[33:15] the just another point the way that I
[33:17] see it with real estate the lenders are
[33:19] taking way too much risk right cuz if
[33:21] the value of the property drops they
[33:23] can't do anything they can't come
[33:24] knocking on your door and tell you hey
[33:26] you got to pay back your loan right away
[33:28] on the other hand with these kinds of
[33:29] loans let's say with Bitcoin if
[33:32] something happens to Bitcoin they can
[33:33] sell your Bitcoin immediately so to them
[33:35] it's way less risk they're guaranteed to
[33:38] get their money back because this way
[33:40] they can sell your Bitcoin. They have
[33:43] your Bitcoin. On the other hand, with
[33:45] real estate, they don't have anything.
[33:48] They just have a paper. You could
[33:50] destroy your property. You could
[33:51] decrease the value of the property
[33:52] immediately. What if insurance doesn't
[33:54] pay out? There's nothing that you can do
[33:57] in that case. Then there's nothing that
[33:58] the lender can do. So, this is way way
[34:00] way better as collateral than real
[34:03] estate. So, I think I mean I think
[34:06] there's always going to be uh there's
[34:08] always going to be a requirement that
[34:10] you have to give your Bitcoin to someone
[34:12] to use it as collateral. Maybe it'll
[34:15] change over time. I don't personally
[34:16] think it will though. I think you'll
[34:18] have to cuz what reason does a lender
[34:20] have to
[34:22] to give you a loan if they don't get to
[34:26] access your Bitcoin? It's just way too
[34:28] much risk for them. And then with the
[34:30] multisig setup, for example, um if you
[34:33] have three parties who are holding keys,
[34:36] how do you if you're worried that you
[34:37] don't have custody of your Bitcoin, then
[34:39] how do you know that the other two
[34:41] parties won't collude? Who's to stop
[34:42] them? At that point, it's the the same
[34:45] thing as giving them up. I mean, the
[34:47] only difference is that you uh might see
[34:50] on chain what's what's going on. Like if
[34:52] they conclude, you actually see it and
[34:54] if you just transfer it, they uh they
[34:56] can do it without telling you. that I
[34:58] think that's the only reason. Then maybe
[34:59] a proof of reserve is getting to be a
[35:01] standard or something like that. I I
[35:03] don't I I can see proof of reserves
[35:05] being the standard. I can see that. That
[35:07] makes sense. But I feel like
[35:09] if okay, you can see your you can see
[35:11] your Bitcoin on chain, but once it's
[35:14] gone, what are you going to do about it?
[35:15] Nothing you can do. Your Bitcoin's gone.
[35:17] There's this you can't it's not like you
[35:19] can reverse time and get your Bitcoin
[35:21] back. It's not like you you can tell the
[35:23] Bitcoin network, oh no, I had multisig
[35:24] on this. You got to reverse this. You
[35:26] got to return this to me. can't. So
[35:28] regardless of what you do, it's I think
[35:29] it's almost the same thing. It's good
[35:31] that you can see your Bitcoin. Of
[35:32] course, I I'm not saying I'm not saying
[35:34] that that's not a good thing. I'm just
[35:35] saying that regardless, people can
[35:37] collude. What is an interest rate that
[35:39] you say it's attractive enough to to
[35:42] consider doing that? So with so my my
[35:47] basis here is MS like borrowing against
[35:50] Bitcoin and then buying MSTY. That's
[35:51] what my basis here is. So, I would say
[35:53] that if you can get a higher dividend
[35:55] from whatever you buy, if you can get a
[35:57] higher cash flow from whatever you buy,
[35:58] then it's fine. If you're going to go
[36:00] and borrow against your Bitcoin and buy
[36:01] real estate, I don't know if it makes
[36:03] sense. But if you go and borrow against
[36:04] your Bitcoin and you buy um if you go
[36:07] and buy Bitcoin, you're taking on a
[36:10] leveraged position of Bitcoin. So, if
[36:12] Bitcoin gives you a 40% return, then
[36:14] you're exceeding that 12% interest rate
[36:17] that you're paying on the on the loan.
[36:18] So, you're getting an advantage of 28%.
[36:21] But then let's say for example if you
[36:22] buy
[36:23] MSTY you're getting cash flow which is
[36:26] good. You can you can you can also
[36:28] create your own cash flow with Bitcoin.
[36:29] I'm not saying that you can't. You can
[36:31] sell some of your Bitcoin if you want to
[36:32] but people don't want to sell their
[36:33] Bitcoin. That's that's the main thing.
[36:34] They don't want to sell it for fiat. You
[36:36] can sell some of your Bitcoin if you
[36:38] want to and you can make your own cash
[36:40] flows but it'll probably cost you sorry
[36:42] you'll probably get more cash
[36:44] flow because you don't have to pay the
[36:47] fees. But then MSTY takes advantage of
[36:50] Micro Strategies volatility. Micro
[36:53] Strategy is a lot more volatile than
[36:54] Bitcoin. So the call options have much
[36:56] higher premium. So they're able to give
[36:57] you something like I had mentioned it
[36:59] before, it might be something like a 50
[37:00] to 70% dividend yield. So if you think
[37:03] about it, you're getting a 50 to 70%
[37:05] dividend yield, plus you're keeping your
[37:06] shares. You can use that dividend yield
[37:08] to pay back your loan. So within a year,
[37:11] you're probably going to have less than
[37:13] half of the loan left. And then you can
[37:15] pay that back by even using your Bitcoin
[37:17] collateral to pay it back if you want
[37:18] to. That way you're basically selling
[37:20] your Bitcoin. You're giving somebody
[37:21] else your Bitcoin, but then you also
[37:23] have this asset now that's going to keep
[37:25] giving you cash in going forward. And if
[37:28] you want to, worst case, you can just
[37:29] sell that that asset, buy more Bitcoin
[37:30] back. Let's take a break for a moment
[37:32] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[37:35] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[37:38] watches. Those watches are the most
[37:40] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[37:43] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[37:47] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[37:49] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[37:52] watch collections. You have the date of
[37:55] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[37:58] there. And of course, also the block
[38:00] height and which epoch we are currently
[38:03] in. I love the level of detail they put
[38:06] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[38:09] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[38:12] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[38:14] love those watches so so much. And now,
[38:17] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[38:20] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[38:22] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[38:24] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[38:26] first way is you put it on a hardware
[38:28] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[38:31] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[38:34] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[38:37] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[38:40] if you check out the link in the
[38:42] description, you even get 5% off if you
[38:45] use the code Robin. And the second way
[38:47] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[38:51] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[38:54] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[38:57] They will personalize for you a
[38:59] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[39:02] your individual situation. They will
[39:05] show you how you can secure your own
[39:07] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[39:10] enough. You also have to keep all your
[39:12] devices secure. One topic that is
[39:14] overlooked often is the inheritance
[39:16] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[39:19] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[39:22] a plan for that in place already? And
[39:24] last but not least, if you're in a
[39:26] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[39:29] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[39:31] that, head over to the
[39:35] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[39:38] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[39:41] be for the first time ever speaking at
[39:43] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[39:46] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[39:48] really looking forward to seeing all of
[39:50] you there. You can get your ticket in
[39:53] the link down in the description of
[39:55] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[39:57] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[40:01] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[40:03] there. Really interesting uh thought
[40:05] experiment connecting the borrowing
[40:08] against your Bitcoin with MSTY and MST.
[40:12] I mean, at that point, you're really
[40:14] balls into Bitcoin. Yeah, that that's
[40:16] the thing, right? You're that that's I
[40:19] feel like that's the thing. Most people
[40:20] aren't taking advantage of this because
[40:21] they don't understand Bitcoin. Most most
[40:23] people don't even have Bitcoin because
[40:25] they don't understand it, right? So, how
[40:27] are they going to take advantage of
[40:28] something like this? Most people just
[40:30] think that Micro Strategy is a Ponzi
[40:32] scheme. I was I didn't really like MSDY
[40:35] before, but a lot of people that this is
[40:37] one of the great things about Twitter.
[40:38] You see different uh you see different
[40:40] angles, you see different opinions, and
[40:42] you make better decisions cuz you see
[40:44] different you see you things you see
[40:46] things from different angles. I don't
[40:48] think anybody has talked about borrowing
[40:50] against a small amount of your Bitcoin
[40:51] and buying MSTY. I think this could I
[40:53] think this would be a really interesting
[40:55] topic. Maybe people can discuss in the
[40:57] comments. And I mean maybe we maybe
[41:01] we're missing out on something here.
[41:02] Maybe there's a point here that I'm not
[41:04] looking at. I'm perfectly fine with
[41:06] being corrected. I actually prefer to be
[41:08] corrected because that would mean that
[41:09] I'm not going to make the the wrong
[41:10] decisions.
[41:12] So you're still in the in the phase
[41:14] where you're basically looking at all
[41:16] the options on how to best approach it.
[41:19] Yes, it's taking some time.
[41:21] Uh one of the problems with MSTY is that
[41:24] they don't actually own Micro Strategy
[41:27] stock. They just own um I think they own
[41:30] just synthetic positions. What problems
[41:32] could that bring? One of the issues is
[41:35] that if
[41:37] the if the derivatives if implied
[41:40] volatility decreases from from what I
[41:43] know the cash amount that they're going
[41:45] to get is going to decrease. I would
[41:47] personally rather own the
[41:49] equity. I think that would be that would
[41:51] be smarter. So that's something that you
[41:52] that you should look into.
[41:54] Um if the options premiums decrease that
[41:59] could be a problem for getting cash
[42:00] flow. um the synthetic position could
[42:05] underperform in certain situations
[42:07] compared to Micro Strategy owning Micro
[42:11] Strategy. I don't know about the exact
[42:12] details on that. I think uh I think
[42:14] somebody was talking about that
[42:16] in in a post I think it was Mark Harvey
[42:19] he was talking about it. So he was
[42:21] saying how if you just bought Micro
[42:22] Strategy or sorry if you bought MSTR and
[42:25] you just reinvested all the dividends
[42:26] you'd have less uh you'd have less value
[42:30] than just holding Micro Strategy stock.
[42:33] So if you don't need the cash flow this
[42:35] may not be the rest this may not be the
[42:37] right decision for you. So if if you
[42:39] don't need the cash flow you may just
[42:40] want to buy Bitcoin borrow against your
[42:43] Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin or borrow against
[42:44] your Bitcoin to buy Micro Strategy. The
[42:46] good thing that I personally like is
[42:47] that you can get you can use the cash
[42:49] flow to pay back your loan whenever you
[42:50] need to make back make your payments and
[42:52] that way you don't feel like you're
[42:53] selling your equity. It's a it's a it's
[42:55] a good thing. I I I like the idea. I
[42:58] never heard anyone talking about that. I
[43:00] borrowing against your Bitcoin I hear
[43:02] all the time.
[43:04] But this combined with MSDY, something
[43:06] with cash flow makes it really
[43:08] interesting and makes it really similar
[43:11] to real estate because one thing uh that
[43:13] real estate has uh if you borrow against
[43:16] the real estate um most people do that
[43:18] not with their own property like but
[43:20] with with with getting uh rentals and
[43:22] then getting properties to to rent out.
[43:25] Then you have the income of of of the
[43:28] rental agreement also where you should
[43:31] structure it in a way you get more money
[43:34] from the income so you can pay off your
[43:37] loan and have some extra cash flow. So
[43:39] you have actually positive cash flow
[43:40] from day one. You don't have to pay off
[43:42] the depth uh that quickly. Having
[43:46] products around that in the Bitcoin
[43:47] ecosystem would allow that shift, the
[43:51] demonet monetization of real estate
[43:53] happening even quicker to Bitcoin. And I
[43:56] always thought, okay, Bitcoin will
[43:58] demonetize gold most importantly. But I
[44:01] think real estate is actually a an asset
[44:04] that might be affected even more than
[44:06] than than gold. uh because gold has a
[44:09] lot of other attributes that that might
[44:11] be interesting for for investors like um
[44:15] like the blackouts scenario situations
[44:17] those those things but from where does
[44:21] people where do people store their store
[44:23] of value I know in Austria a lot of
[44:26] people that own a home or own rental
[44:29] properties I don't uh know so many
[44:31] people that own gold in in in their
[44:34] reserves and and real estate in in
[44:35] general is a bigger market than gold So
[44:38] may maybe real estate is is really
[44:41] converging because of that more and more
[44:43] to Bitcoin because Bitcoin has
[44:46] similar similar properties. I mean it's
[44:49] it's very different. Uh but from a store
[44:51] of value perspective and the products
[44:53] around it, it could really quickly go
[44:56] where people say like oh like why do I
[44:58] still hold real estate? It's so much
[44:59] easier like to own digital real estate.
[45:03] Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, why
[45:05] would you want to hold real estate when
[45:06] you have to do the maintenance, you have
[45:07] to do the repairs, you have to talk to a
[45:09] realtor. You have all these risks
[45:11] involved. You have to deal with
[45:12] insurance. You have to make all these
[45:14] payments. You have to have liability
[45:16] insurance. You could possibly have a
[45:18] tenant that doesn't pay you anymore
[45:21] when you could just buy MSTY.
[45:25] If you really want cash flow, then you
[45:27] could buy MSTY with a fraction of the
[45:29] amount of money that you would put into
[45:30] real estate and get a way bigger cash
[45:34] flow because what you're taking
[45:36] advantage of is Micro Strategies
[45:38] volatility. But again, you again I I
[45:41] wouldn't even say to have a majority of
[45:42] your portfolio in MSTY. I think just
[45:45] holding Bitcoin should be the majority
[45:46] of your portfolio. You might want to
[45:47] have some micro strategy uh stock. You
[45:50] might want to have other Bitcoin
[45:52] treasury companies. Um, I think Bitcoin
[45:56] should be the majority of your portfolio
[45:57] regardless because that that Bitcoin is
[45:59] the bearer asset regardless of what you
[46:01] what kind of cash flow you're getting.
[46:03] Even if you buy MSDY, you're still
[46:05] getting a shitcoin as cash flow, right?
[46:08] You're getting US dollars. I I don't I
[46:11] don't personally want US dollars, but
[46:12] unfortunately, my expenses are paid for
[46:17] in currencies. The majority, like I
[46:20] can't go to Walmart today and pay them
[46:22] in Bitcoin. I can't go to Costco and pay
[46:23] them with Bitcoin. I have to pay them in
[46:26] currency because that's what they want.
[46:28] Maybe eventually they'll want Bitcoin
[46:30] and then I won't have to do something
[46:32] like this, right? And then at that
[46:33] point, I think by the time that
[46:35] happens, it just means that fiat has
[46:37] failed. It's super interesting as as a
[46:39] way to to spice up your Bitcoin only
[46:43] portfolio
[46:45] to give some give some flavor. Uh yeah,
[46:49] but keep in mind you're perfectly fine
[46:50] just holding Bitcoin too, right? You
[46:52] don't have to do all this. This is like
[46:54] like you said, it's financial
[46:55] engineering. It's not something you have
[46:56] to do. I'm not saying that you have to
[46:57] do this. I'm just saying it could work
[47:00] if you have expenses. It's a way you're
[47:02] taking on more risk, right? You're
[47:04] basically risking some of your bit. What
[47:06] we mean by risk here is that it's
[47:07] potential. It's possible that you could
[47:09] lose all of that Bitcoin that you use as
[47:11] collateral. That's the risk here. If you
[47:14] lose that Bitcoin that you lose as that
[47:16] you use as collateral, something happens
[47:17] to the lender. First of all, you still
[47:19] have the MSTY. But again, if MSTY fails
[47:22] as well, then you don't owe a debt cuz
[47:25] if you lose the Bitcoin, let's say if it
[47:27] gets confiscated, they're probably not
[47:29] going to make you pay it back if your
[47:31] Bitcoin gets confiscated, cuz I would
[47:34] assume that that's going to be used as
[47:36] uh as a payment. So, there's that side.
[47:39] So, the the good thing here is the
[47:40] maximum risk that you would take is the
[47:42] amount of Bitcoin they use as
[47:44] collateral. They're not going to check
[47:45] your bank account. They're not going to
[47:46] check your credit rating. Your Bitcoin
[47:49] is your credit in a way. Let's talk a
[47:51] little bit about
[47:52] how so you you said in the beginning
[47:56] that we this is only something till we
[47:59] get to this Bitcoin
[48:00] world. So you think that like in a
[48:04] bitcoin world how different will be
[48:06] lending and and those financial things
[48:10] uh when we only have Bitcoin and nobody
[48:12] has the possibility to create money out
[48:15] of thin air like what do you think will
[48:17] change? I guess people will still borrow
[48:19] money. I think the lending is going to
[48:22] be based on um I think there's so first
[48:24] of all, I think there's going to be very
[48:26] little confu consumer spending. Consu
[48:28] sorry, consumer lending, not consumer
[48:29] spending. There's probably going to be a
[48:30] lot more consumer spending because
[48:31] people are going to be wealthier. So
[48:33] there's probably going to be very little
[48:34] consumer lending because people will
[48:36] just have savings. They'll be paid in
[48:38] Bitcoin. Their Bitcoin will increase in
[48:39] value over time. Over time, their
[48:41] expenses are going to decrease in value.
[48:43] So if you have if you make the right
[48:44] decisions, you're eventually going to
[48:46] become financially free regardless. I
[48:48] don't know about if your future
[48:50] generations are going to become
[48:51] financially free, but you will
[48:52] eventually become financially free if
[48:53] you save in Bitcoin because the cost of
[48:56] everything else decreases in terms of
[48:57] Bitcoin no matter what it is. So that's
[49:00] one
[49:01] thing. The I think
[49:04] the if your cost of living is decreasing
[49:07] over time, you always
[49:10] have Bitcoin.
[49:14] So you're using less of your savings
[49:17] over time to pay for your cost of
[49:18] living, meaning that you become more
[49:20] prosperous. You're able to afford more
[49:21] things. This is basically what Jeff
[49:23] Booth is talking about in his book,
[49:24] right? The cost of tomorrow, the or
[49:27] whatever whatever it was called, but
[49:28] basically the cost of living is going to
[49:30] decrease over time. So it's going to
[49:31] lead to more prosperity. People won't
[49:33] borrow for themselves. Maybe they'll
[49:35] borrow to start businesses. Maybe
[49:38] they'll borrow to start to buy capital
[49:39] assets. maybe cars. Um maybe they'll I
[49:44] don't know if they'll be able to borrow
[49:45] to buy real estate or maybe they'll
[49:47] borrow Bitcoin to buy their real estate.
[49:50] So where if we go to a Bitcoin world, I
[49:52] you have to remember that the risks to a
[49:55] lender are much much higher if they lend
[49:57] their Bitcoin. So if somebody wants to
[50:00] borrow Bitcoin, if you want to borrow
[50:01] Bitcoin from me, if you want to borrow
[50:03] fiat from me, it's different cuz you can
[50:04] give me your Bitcoin. I can give you
[50:06] fiat. I can charge you an interest rate.
[50:08] If something happens, then I can sell
[50:10] your Bitcoin. But if Bitcoin becomes
[50:12] money, this in this world, the current
[50:14] system that we're in, we're basically
[50:17] using fiat as the base layer. That base
[50:20] layer is corrupted. We can create as
[50:22] much of that base layer as we want to.
[50:23] So to banks, it's not as risky to lend
[50:25] you that base layer money. So if banks
[50:28] want to give you fiat currencies, it's
[50:30] not as risky because they can just
[50:31] create more. But if they want to lend
[50:33] you Bitcoin, it's much more risky for
[50:36] them. They're not just I I think the way
[50:38] that they're going to do it is they're
[50:40] only first of all they're only going to
[50:42] lend Bitcoin to
[50:44] businesses. So if you can create more
[50:46] Bitcoin in the future, they'll lend it
[50:48] to you. If you can have some kind of
[50:49] idea where uh you can produce more
[50:52] Bitcoin in the future in the current
[50:54] system, they don't care about that cuz
[50:55] the risk doesn't really matter. If if
[50:57] somebody lends you money on a credit
[50:58] card, if you don't pay them back, who
[51:00] cares? They made they made their 20 30%
[51:02] per year. They're okay with it. they've
[51:04] accepted that you're probably not going
[51:06] to pay them back, right? With
[51:08] Bitcoin, if you don't pay them back,
[51:10] then they lose Bitcoin and you can't
[51:13] create Bitcoin out of nothing. You can't
[51:14] rehypothecate Bitcoin. So, I think the
[51:16] way that that's going to happen is we're
[51:18] going to see a lot less unsecured
[51:20] debt, a lot fewer entities that are
[51:24] giving unsecured debt to people because
[51:26] it'll be too risky for them. But when
[51:29] you borrow Bitcoin to let's say start a
[51:32] business, maybe the bank will want a
[51:35] portion of that value of that business,
[51:38] right? So if they believe in the idea,
[51:40] maybe they'll start the business with
[51:42] you. They'll give you seed capital, they
[51:45] get 50%, you get 50% for the idea for
[51:47] doing all the work. And if the business
[51:50] turns out to do well, it's it's almost
[51:51] going to be like Shark Tank, right? So,
[51:54] if the business ends up doing well, they
[51:57] get 50% of the value. They get basically
[51:59] 50% of the
[52:01] potential
[52:02] gain, but they don't really earn
[52:04] interest. I think that's the way it's
[52:06] going to work. I don't I don't think
[52:07] they're going to get interest. I think
[52:08] they're going to I think they're going
[52:11] to be okay with not getting interest
[52:12] because in the long term, the reward
[52:15] will be bigger. In that point, it's
[52:16] basically venture capital that they are
[52:18] providing pretty much. I think there's
[52:20] going to be more venture capitalists,
[52:21] more venture capitalism, more more uh
[52:26] individuals lending to you because they
[52:29] can take part in your venture. I'm also
[52:32] really excited about
[52:33] bringing I I don't know if we have
[52:36] discussed that uh in our I don't know
[52:39] three four conversations we already had
[52:41] on on on podcast. Um but I've actually
[52:44] come from the investing world to
[52:46] Bitcoin. So I've invested in stocks. I
[52:48] picked stocks. I I loved doing it. Um I
[52:51] was bored in school and I was sitting in
[52:53] the last row and we were laptop school.
[52:56] So we had our laptops open and most
[52:59] people just like playing video games or
[53:01] anything like that. I had uh 10 cues
[53:04] 10ks of of companies open and I was
[53:07] reading them. Uh it was so interesting
[53:09] for me to pick stocks. I back then I had
[53:12] literally no capital. So I had to really
[53:15] focus on like which share do I buy? I
[53:17] bought like one share here and one share
[53:19] there. I could also not uh I I had to
[53:22] buy one full share. There was another
[53:24] option to buy like now you can buy
[53:26] fractions of shares of companies with
[53:28] different apps. And I was really excited
[53:31] about that. Like I can invest in
[53:33] companies and I I buy in a mission. I
[53:36] can buy in in some some future
[53:38] potential.
[53:40] And with Fiat we kind of lost that. and
[53:43] we have ETF products and now everyone is
[53:45] investing but they actually just want to
[53:47] save. So what happens in the Bitcoin
[53:49] world for me is those people that just
[53:52] want to save, they have a really good
[53:53] vehicle for that now, Bitcoin. And most
[53:56] people will be best off if they have
[53:58] most of their money in Bitcoin. That
[54:00] that's how I'll see a Bitcoin world. And
[54:02] then there are some people that say,
[54:04] "Hey, with let's say 5% or 20% or 30%,
[54:08] whatever the number is of my capital of
[54:11] my Bitcoin, I want to play. I wanna find
[54:15] out which one will be the best
[54:17] performing uh company in a new era like
[54:20] like some fancy new uh industry or
[54:23] something that I really want to support
[54:25] or I want to support a startup. So so I
[54:29] think Bitcoin will bring investing back
[54:31] into investing and keep the saving out
[54:34] of investing and that's how how I look
[54:36] at it. Completely agreed. I I agree with
[54:38] you 100%. the the
[54:41] the I think right now people are seeing
[54:44] index funds as saving, but index funds
[54:46] are extremely risky. If we couldn't
[54:48] print more fiat out of nothing, then
[54:49] your index funds would go down to zero.
[54:51] Yeah. It's it's like even now there's
[54:53] like what is it seven or eight companies
[54:56] that make profit and make the S&P 500 go
[54:59] up and the rest of it is kind of drag on
[55:02] the whole thing. So,
[55:05] um it it's it's super fun. Like I was
[55:08] literally um studying those 10 coups and
[55:11] 10ks. I was reading them. I I was up
[55:14] till like 1 2 a.m. in the morning in
[55:17] Europe to uh follow the conference calls
[55:19] in America. It was like almost like I
[55:22] don't know Super Bowl for me to to stay
[55:24] up late and and and and listen to those
[55:26] conference
[55:27] calls. But there was something more
[55:30] interesting coming along which is
[55:31] Bitcoin. I think it's the biggest thing
[55:32] that currently happening. But I think
[55:35] and I I'm I'm pretty sure actually at
[55:38] some point I will get back to
[55:40] investing because that's why I
[55:42] originally came to Bitcoin. Now I've
[55:44] discovered that savings technology and
[55:46] now I'm like okay the next five to 10
[55:48] years probably I'll be just like all in
[55:50] bitcoin but maybe we'll get to a bitcoin
[55:53] world and and then that's actually
[55:54] something I also want to ask you what
[55:56] what is your kind of projection of of
[55:58] when we get to this bitcoin world but
[56:00] maybe we get there in 15 years 50 years
[56:02] 100 years whatever the time frame is I
[56:05] want to then be able to invest again and
[56:08] actually see okay what is the what is
[56:11] the company that gives me a bitcoin
[56:13] yield build. So like more Bitcoin than I
[56:16] going to put in because Bitcoin is now
[56:18] the the hurdle rate. How do you look at
[56:20] like when do we come to this uh Bitcoin
[56:23] world high where you want to define
[56:24] Bitcoin world? Well, I think it depends
[56:27] on the individual, right? If you're if
[56:29] it's you for example, you're in the
[56:30] Bitcoin world already. If it's somebody
[56:32] who doesn't understand Bitcoin, then
[56:33] they're in the fiat world. I think
[56:34] there's uh there's a point where you
[56:37] step into the Bitcoin world, that's
[56:39] where you get orange pill and then you
[56:40] don't go back. There's no turning back
[56:42] at that point. Once you've gotten orange
[56:44] pill, once you understand Bitcoin,
[56:46] you're not going to turn back. I And
[56:47] then something else that you said there,
[56:49] uh, you're investing.
[56:50] So, I think you're investing already.
[56:53] You're investing in your business.
[56:54] You're you have a business that's
[56:56] creating Bitcoin yield. So, I think the
[57:00] difference here is that Bitcoin is going
[57:01] to create more entrepreneurs. It's going
[57:02] to give more people an an incentive to
[57:05] start their own businesses. So instead
[57:07] of investing in somebody else's
[57:09] business, you could make your company go
[57:12] public, right? You could actually become
[57:14] you could become that company. It's
[57:16] going to give more people a reason to be
[57:18] entrepreneurs. It's going to give more
[57:21] um if somebody believes in your ideas,
[57:24] they'll give you money. Why would you
[57:26] give somebody why would you give money
[57:28] to Apple? Why would you give money to
[57:29] Microsoft or the companies in the
[57:31] future? Build your own business. You're
[57:33] investing in your own business, right?
[57:34] That's your then we have we have Bitcoin
[57:36] as your savings account. So no matter
[57:38] what that's your fallback then you have
[57:41] your business which is creating more
[57:43] Bitcoin
[57:44] yield. So you're already doing that.
[57:46] It's true. I never looked at it that
[57:48] way. Yeah. It's like you're already in
[57:49] the in the you're investing in your own
[57:52] bit. I guess uh that's always what I uh
[57:55] actually say. It's like the only
[57:57] investing that I want to do currently
[57:59] outside of Bitcoin is your own
[58:02] business, your own knowledge, and if you
[58:06] emotionally need it, your own home, but
[58:09] not financially, just like if you need
[58:11] emotion, like some people like, "Oh, I
[58:13] really want to own my own home." I'm not
[58:15] one of those, but I I get it. I think
[58:17] even Jack Malas is uh said that once in
[58:20] in an interview. He owns Bitcoin, his
[58:23] business, and his home. Yeah, I saw
[58:25] that. Like with your business, for
[58:27] example, you're you think you want you
[58:30] want cash flow, you want Bitcoin yield.
[58:31] You can create something that's so
[58:33] valuable that people consume it. People
[58:37] want to buy it forever. That's you
[58:40] creating cash flow, right? Also, a
[58:42] house, I wouldn't consider it an
[58:44] investment. I would consider it a
[58:45] lifestyle decision cuz a house cost you
[58:47] a lot of money. In real terms, in real
[58:49] terms, what I mean is Bitcoin. Bitcoin
[58:51] is the hurdle rate in this case. In real
[58:53] terms, you're going to lose a lot of
[58:54] money owning a
[58:55] house. You can of course uh rent a
[58:58] house. You can you're going to pay more,
[59:00] but there's a lot of maintenance.
[59:01] There's repairs. When you buy a house,
[59:03] you have to pay 3 to 5% or like 5 to 6%
[59:06] as realtor fees. You have to pay land
[59:08] transfer taxes. When you rent a house,
[59:10] you don't have to think about that. You
[59:11] also have the freedom that comes with
[59:13] not owning a house when you rent, right?
[59:16] So, when you own a bit when when you own
[59:17] a house, I wouldn't consider that an
[59:18] investment. I would say that that's a
[59:21] that's a
[59:22] liability. That's a you're forced to
[59:25] stay in one location. No matter what
[59:26] happens, you're in that. I mean, I know
[59:28] a lot of people, they want that
[59:29] stability. Perfectly fine. I get it. But
[59:31] that's a lifestyle decision. Yeah. It's
[59:33] either a lifestyle decision or you're
[59:36] building a business with it, right? I
[59:38] get But I I wouldn't also recommend
[59:41] that, but like it's definitely not an
[59:44] investment, right? That could be the
[59:46] investment that you're making. So that's
[59:48] in a way that's an investment as well.
[59:50] But I I never got that argument because
[59:52] uh people are saying like oh like then
[59:54] then nobody can kick you out like first
[59:56] of all it's not true like if the
[59:57] government wants to kick you out of the
[59:59] house you're out. Um and second is like
[60:03] it's really hard in Austria at least I
[60:05] don't know how it's in Canada or America
[60:07] it's really hard to kick a tenant out.
[60:11] It's not that easy that you that there
[60:12] has to be something critical
[60:16] Yeah. like you you and even if there's
[60:18] something critical like you need like uh
[60:22] uh you need the whole uh process and the
[60:24] law process till he's actually out. It
[60:27] cost you a lot of money and a lot of
[60:28] time till he actually is out. So, I
[60:31] don't get the stability necessarily.
[60:34] Like there's like you can make a 5year
[60:36] contract, a 10 year contract. There's a
[60:38] lot like that's a lot of stability and
[60:40] until then you really have to mess
[60:42] something up that he's able to kick you
[60:46] out. So like
[60:48] this the stability argument I never and
[60:50] there's one another argument that I
[60:52] sometimes get like oh you wouldn't care
[60:55] that much about your rental place than
[60:57] than your than your actual home. You can
[61:00] make your rental place also nice like if
[61:03] you make your rental place nice. I heard
[61:05] of stories actually um from Michael
[61:08] Terren. You know him also probably. Um
[61:12] he he had stories where he renovated his
[61:15] rental place and then the landlord gave
[61:17] him a discount on the rent because he
[61:20] made uh a nice distribution to the home
[61:22] and made it better. So the landlord was
[61:24] like okay I'll give you a discount on on
[61:26] the uh rent because you are now invested
[61:29] in this and so I want to pay you back
[61:31] for that. Basically see most landlords
[61:33] wouldn't do that. most land. That's
[61:35] true. That's true. Huh. Yeah. They would
[61:37] tell you no when I'm not giving you
[61:38] anything. That That's a I think that's a
[61:40] like a a very
[61:42] very a very
[61:45] um it's not going to happen often. It's
[61:49] a very rare occurrence of a landlord
[61:52] who's willing to give you money. If
[61:53] anything, they'll tell you um you have
[61:56] to pay a fine for upgrading your
[61:57] property. That's true. Unfortunately,
[61:59] that's true. Yeah. But I get I get what
[62:02] you're saying, though. That makes sense.
[62:03] I I think people could that that could
[62:05] definitely happen.
[62:07] Yeah, it's it's it's it's just something
[62:10] um it's it's a it's a lifestyle
[62:12] decision. Yeah. But even even then like
[62:15] before you buy a home you really have to
[62:17] think think twice if you really like I I
[62:21] also like I hope um it will be so cheap
[62:26] in 10 20 years to buy a home when you
[62:29] look at from a bitcoin perspective that
[62:32] it actually makes sense again. I think
[62:34] bit uh home price will come down so much
[62:36] that it actually makes sense to buy a
[62:38] home again. It's like buying I don't
[62:41] know like a small car something like
[62:42] that and and a car is actually maybe not
[62:45] even a a bad comparison because a car is
[62:48] also consumption good that should that
[62:50] is getting less value over time. And it
[62:55] was always interesting for me that you
[62:57] buy a home and 5 years from now it's in
[63:01] a worse off position like it's not as
[63:04] new as as it was and you get more money
[63:07] for that. then there's something wrong
[63:09] with the money. I mean, it's because
[63:11] people buy houses to borrow against
[63:13] them. They buy like I've spoken about I
[63:16] think I may have mentioned this in one
[63:18] of our podcasts before, but something
[63:20] like 10% of houses in the US are
[63:23] unoccupied. Nobody nobody lives in them.
[63:25] The reason why people own them is number
[63:27] one because they can borrow against them
[63:30] and number two they think that the value
[63:31] of the houses or the the land is going
[63:34] to keep appreciating. So, they can keep
[63:36] borrowing more and more. If we go back
[63:37] to that spreadsheet, the spreadsheet
[63:38] that I mentioned before, let's say your
[63:40] property value goes from 500,000 to a
[63:42] million, we know that more money is
[63:43] going to be pumped into the system. So,
[63:45] the value of the property is going to
[63:46] keep going up. In the beginning, you
[63:49] could borrow $400,000 against it. At the
[63:52] end, you could borrow $800,000 against
[63:54] it. So, you basically turned, let's say,
[63:56] a 10% dep or a 20% deposit of $100,000
[64:00] into a $500,000 home. You turned that
[64:03] $100,000 into $800,000 of
[64:07] cash. That's why the system is broken.
[64:10] That's why people don't want to sell
[64:11] their houses. They want to hold on to
[64:13] houses forever. And this is this isn't
[64:15] just happening in the US. It's not just
[64:16] happening in Canada. It's happening
[64:18] everywhere. I've I spoke to somebody
[64:20] from I think it was Switzerland. They
[64:22] were saying the same thing. Um the house
[64:25] prices are going up there. They can't
[64:27] afford anything. This person was I think
[64:29] in their late 20s. They couldn't afford
[64:32] a house. They couldn't the prices of
[64:34] groceries are going up like crazy.
[64:36] Everything is getting more expensive.
[64:37] And this this is happening everywhere,
[64:39] right? And it's because again the system
[64:40] is broken. The money that we use is a
[64:44] scam. Very true. I I I want to make that
[64:47] um note for the people listening and
[64:50] watching um because we had a really
[64:53] great two conversations already and uh
[64:56] if you just type in the both of our
[64:58] names in YouTube actually it it pops up
[65:01] um so you can check it out basically and
[65:03] also there's like um account so you can
[65:06] see also directly his his YouTube
[65:08] channel and uh yeah like if you if you
[65:11] want to hear more of of of the two of us
[65:13] we have a lot more hours that we already
[65:17] got behind us. Uh, and it was really
[65:19] great conversations. By the way, I'll
[65:21] I'll I'll just see the thumbnail. We
[65:22] said like 1 million till 2028. I guess
[65:25] we are we were bearish like a year ago.
[65:29] Yeah. Who knows? Maybe maybe Bitcoin
[65:31] will come down. I don't know what's
[65:33] going to happen in the short term. Maybe
[65:34] that time stamp maybe that uh maybe
[65:37] that'll turn out to be completely wrong.
[65:39] Maybe we're too bullish. Who knows?
[65:42] True. True. Shortterm we never know. But
[65:44] uh longterm we we have some some things.
[65:47] Um we have an endine in the podcast. Um
[65:50] uh that is the the same question every
[65:52] time. But I've changed it a little bit
[65:54] around for people that have been on
[65:56] again uh to the question, what have you
[65:59] learned since your last appearance on
[66:01] this podcast outside of Bitcoin? Um oh,
[66:04] I've been uh so I've been trying to go
[66:08] to the gym more, trying to be more
[66:10] consistent. So, I've been learning about
[66:12] uh different exercises, different
[66:14] routines, workout routines. I It's not
[66:17] that that's new to me. I was learning
[66:18] about it before, but I've started
[66:20] learning about it again. So, I slacked
[66:21] off a little bit. I was I was investing
[66:23] in my business basically. I I slacked
[66:25] off on the gym, stopped going as much. I
[66:27] should have stayed consistent, but now
[66:28] I'm working on going back. So, I've been
[66:30] learning about how creatine works. Uh
[66:33] I've been learning about different ways
[66:34] to to eat better. Um, my wife has been
[66:38] convincing me to eat healthier
[66:42] and yeah, health is wealth. I love that.
[66:47] That's that's a really that's a
[66:48] Bitcoiner thing to do. I love that.
[66:50] Really cool. We have an end, as you
[66:52] know, where the previous guest is asking
[66:54] a question for the next guest without
[66:55] knowing who the next guest is, and the
[66:56] previous guest asks you the question.
[66:58] What do you think is the best objection
[67:01] against Bitcoin and how do you respond
[67:03] to that? Well, the best objection I
[67:04] think the best objection is probably
[67:06] that people won't adopt it. The the fact
[67:10] that it's not the fact that it's not
[67:13] physical. People will keep going people
[67:16] will keep saying that Bitcoin is
[67:17] worthless because it's not physical for
[67:19] a very long time. I think that's going
[67:21] to be something that will I I think
[67:22] people will change their minds. I think
[67:24] the older generations are going to die
[67:26] on that hill. They're not going to want
[67:27] to buy Bitcoin. Let's say somebody who's
[67:28] like 70. If they say that Bitcoin is not
[67:30] real, they're not going to buy it,
[67:32] right? somebody like Warren Buffett. I
[67:34] don't know if he's going to buy Bitcoin,
[67:36] but there are going to be other people
[67:39] who are followers of these investors and
[67:43] they're going to just fall for the trap.
[67:45] They're not going to buy Bitcoin because
[67:46] they think that it's not physical. So,
[67:48] by the time they figure it out, it's
[67:50] going to be worth a lot more. So, I
[67:52] think that's a problem. That's something
[67:53] that could actually
[67:54] uh hurt a lot of people over the next
[67:58] couple years, couple
[67:59] decades. And it's very hard to push back
[68:02] on that because you can't really tell
[68:04] people, yeah, Bitcoin is digital, so you
[68:06] should own it. Even though you want
[68:07] something that's physical, right? If
[68:08] somebody wants a real estate, there's a
[68:10] reason why they want real estate. They
[68:11] the reason why they want it is because
[68:12] they can touch it or they know that it's
[68:14] there. But Bitcoin has all these
[68:16] advantages over real
[68:18] estate that you can only really wrap
[68:21] your head around if you have an a growth
[68:24] mindset. If you have a a fixed mindset,
[68:25] you're not going to get it. It's
[68:26] interesting. I I think the Bitcoiners
[68:29] It's also interesting. It just made me
[68:30] think of um the responsibility that
[68:33] Bitcoiners have once we get to this
[68:35] Bitcoin world. a lot of the wealth will
[68:38] be concentrated actually in early
[68:40] Bitcoiners and uh early people that saw
[68:43] that that mission uh way before anyone
[68:46] else because um I think we also talked
[68:49] about that last time that 90% plus will
[68:52] still have no clue about Bitcoin even if
[68:54] we had a million per coin. I'm like,
[68:56] yeah, like that's true. Like most people
[68:58] don't get the internet and then and if
[69:00] the internet would have had an token
[69:02] that would have gone through the roof
[69:03] and people still wouldn't care. Like
[69:06] it's it's it's fascinating for me that
[69:08] it's basically that's basically what
[69:09] you're doing when you're buying Bitcoin,
[69:10] right? You're buying a token that allows
[69:13] you to buy anything on the internet.
[69:14] You're basically you're interacting with
[69:17] the Bitcoin or the internet economy with
[69:20] Bitcoin. So that that's what that I
[69:22] think that's a really great comparison.
[69:24] I think people are not seeing it that
[69:25] way. They may eventually, but who knows?
[69:29] Yeah. I like to compare um what if you
[69:32] could buy a TCPIP token
[69:36] uh in the year
[69:38] 1993 and you gain all the value that
[69:42] Apple, Google, Microsoft will occur
[69:46] natively on the token and it all comes
[69:48] back to the native token, the TCP IP
[69:50] token. Yes, that's basically how I look
[69:54] at Bitcoin where there's a lot of things
[69:56] going on top of it and everyone is using
[69:58] it, but all the value comes down to the
[70:00] base token again. And this is a a really
[70:03] nice comparison. Good thing that didn't
[70:05] happen cuz if that did then we would
[70:07] have both missed out. It would that
[70:09] token would have probably been money
[70:10] today. So, yeah, because I was born in
[70:13] 1998. Yeah,
[70:18] true. this I I guess this token is now
[70:21] Bitcoin. It just needed a little bit
[70:22] longer to to acrewue. Uh thank you so
