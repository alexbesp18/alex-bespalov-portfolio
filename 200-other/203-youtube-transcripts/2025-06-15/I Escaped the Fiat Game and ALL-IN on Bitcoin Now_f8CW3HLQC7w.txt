[00:00] you kind of get to this Bitcoin Zen
[00:01] position where it's obvious what's
[00:04] happening. It's obvious that fiat can
[00:06] get printed forever. Make sure that
[00:08] you're focusing on what's what's your
[00:10] big stack. You don't need to hit a home
[00:12] run on some random leverage play. The
[00:15] the biggest asymmetrical bet in my mind
[00:17] still is Bitcoin. The strategy should be
[00:20] everyone else is buying Bitcoin, which
[00:21] is the only finite thing. the CEOs can
[00:24] dilute the shareholders, but there's
[00:26] Satoshi is not coming back to dilute
[00:29] Bitcoin. And so that's the difference in
[00:31] my mind. Believe me, it's going to be so
[00:33] much better than playing these fiat
[00:35] games because the fiat games are not
[00:36] fulfilling. I think a smart man or a
[00:39] wise man would do what Sailor's doing,
[00:41] which Sailor isn't buying all the stocks
[00:43] and putting it in his treasury. He's
[00:45] buying the
[00:46] [Music]
[00:49] Bitcoin. Before we get started, um, give
[00:52] the people a little bit of an overview
[00:54] of who you are and why you're excited
[00:56] about Bitcoin
[00:57] currently. Uh, I have been excited about
[01:00] Bitcoin currently for a long time now.
[01:03] So, uh, uh, I, my name is Sean Harris. I
[01:07] got into Bitcoin. I started buying back
[01:10] in 2019. I'm class of 2019. Um, so I'm
[01:14] not an OG, at least not in my mind. And
[01:17] um you know I'm excited about Bitcoin
[01:20] because it is the true opt out. It's the
[01:23] solution to fiat. And uh you know that
[01:26] was something that uh that was boggling
[01:28] my mind for a long time. How to save
[01:31] money correctly, how to how to be able
[01:33] to get to get money, how to have lasting
[01:36] wealth for the rest of my life. And uh
[01:39] Bitcoin is the solution. So it's been
[01:42] fun for me to to start stacking. I've
[01:45] lost Bitcoin along the way by doing
[01:47] stupid things and um and that's okay
[01:50] because it's still early and I still get
[01:53] to stack and trade in dirty fiat for for
[01:57] yeah we we all have done stupid things
[02:00] by the way but like what because for me
[02:03] 2019 is almost like almost OG level it's
[02:07] been 6 years so you're almost completed
[02:10] like you're in your second cycle that's
[02:12] like uh pretty advanced on stuff. I
[02:15] guess what year do you have to be in
[02:17] Bitcoin to classify for you as an OG?
[02:22] That's a that's a great question. I
[02:24] don't I honestly I don't know. I feel
[02:26] like to me it feels like class of 2015
[02:30] is OG's, but then um you know, I'm sure
[02:34] the class of 2015's CL it's like if they
[02:37] bought in 2013, those guys feel like the
[02:39] OGs, but those guys it's 2011, you know.
[02:42] So, it's just it's probably all relative
[02:45] at this point. I don't even know what
[02:46] what classifies someone as an OG. Just
[02:49] as long as you're stacking and you get
[02:50] what's going on right now. If you're
[02:52] paying attention, um you should you
[02:54] should uh you should be paying attention
[02:56] to Bitcoin right now. Yeah. It's like
[02:59] someone that comes in Bitcoin in 2040
[03:02] will look at the people that come in now
[03:04] in 2025 as OGs and like, oh, they have
[03:06] been in Bitcoin since 15 years. What?
[03:09] Yeah.
[03:10] Yeah. It does feel cool to say that I've
[03:13] been buying Bitcoin since before uh
[03:16] Michael Sailor. I guess that feels cool.
[03:18] He has a lot more Bitcoin than me, just
[03:20] by a little
[03:22] bit. But um it does feel cool to be able
[03:26] to think, oh yeah, there's people that
[03:27] have come after me that are pretty big
[03:29] in this in this Bitcoin space and the
[03:33] biggest one are still to come. Like
[03:34] there's so many uh huge people out there
[03:36] that haven't figured out Bitcoin yet. so
[03:38] many big companies, so many big uh big
[03:41] money distributors that like it's like
[03:43] how how do you haven't started a small
[03:46] position at least like uh it's it's it's
[03:48] it's mind-blowing for me. I I don't
[03:50] understand how people don't see it yet.
[03:52] It like, you know, just talking to your
[03:54] friends, talking to people. Um I don't
[03:58] once you've been in it for long enough,
[04:00] it just you kind of get to this Bitcoin
[04:02] Zen position where it's obvious what's
[04:05] what's happening. It's obvious that fiat
[04:08] can get printed forever and um and we
[04:11] have digital scarcity and it's
[04:13] absolutely scarce in Bitcoin. And so it
[04:16] only makes sense, at least in my mind.
[04:18] And maybe uh maybe people look at me, I
[04:20] got these orange glasses on and they
[04:22] think I'm crazy, but uh but it makes
[04:26] sense when you just think about it
[04:28] logically. The thing that can't get
[04:30] printed uh that's where all all the
[04:33] value will acrew to. Yeah. Yeah. It's a
[04:35] funny thing because we say like you
[04:38] probably like you you're so deep into
[04:39] Bitcoin you have orange glasses on so
[04:41] you only see the the Bitcoin and there's
[04:44] more and more Bitcoiners who actually
[04:45] have an orange glass on. I love that.
[04:49] Yeah. Yep. It helps. It helps out. It
[04:52] helps out. Block out all the
[04:53] distractions.
[04:55] Focus solely on Bitcoin a signal. Um I I
[04:58] really want to get to the to the bull
[05:00] market and and how you you think about
[05:01] things. But um just because I think it's
[05:04] also like um an educational obligation
[05:07] that we kind of have to talk about the
[05:09] stupid things that we did so other
[05:11] people can avoid them. And you talked
[05:13] about uh that you lost Bitcoin along the
[05:15] way with stupid things. What what what
[05:17] kind of things did you do? So you know
[05:19] what's interesting, right? So I started
[05:21] in 2019. Um, and and the meme that's
[05:24] been around forever is not your keys,
[05:27] not your coins. And such a simple simple
[05:31] phrase, such a simple meme. And uh, but
[05:34] it's so true, right? And if you don't
[05:36] have your keys to your Bitcoin, you
[05:38] don't have your coins. And I think what
[05:40] the biggest thing that people don't
[05:42] realize and what I didn't realize when I
[05:43] started studying money is that uh, the
[05:46] money that you have in your bank account
[05:48] or the perceived money that you have in
[05:50] your bank account is not actually yours.
[05:52] It's an IOU from your bank saying that
[05:56] when you need this money, when you swipe
[05:58] your card, we will permission you to use
[06:02] the money and we will give you access to
[06:05] your money. And um you know one and so
[06:08] the thing that you always think about is
[06:10] okay if it's if I have to have my money
[06:13] permissioned by somebody else or by
[06:15] another
[06:16] institution, is it really my money in
[06:19] the first place? is it really my money
[06:20] if I don't control it? If I don't have
[06:22] the full control over it, is it mine?
[06:25] And um the answer is no. It's obviously
[06:27] it's not yours. You know, there's so
[06:29] many and there's so many cases
[06:30] throughout history, recent history of
[06:34] countries or sovereign nations that go
[06:37] through debt crisis or sovereign debt
[06:39] crisis, whether it be, you know, Cyprus
[06:42] in 2013. Um you can Google all this,
[06:44] right? If you're watching right now, you
[06:46] can pause it. You can Google it. what
[06:48] happened in Cyprus in 2013 with a
[06:50] balance that they did. You know, they
[06:52] you have Lebanon, right? They went
[06:55] through a debt crisis or a currency
[06:57] crisis in 2019. Um, which which just
[07:01] kept going on. People were literally
[07:03] going to the banks, robbing the banks
[07:06] back for their own money. Um, I don't
[07:09] know if you call that robbing the banks
[07:10] because they're going to get their own
[07:12] money. I don't know what you call it,
[07:12] but they're showing up to the banks with
[07:14] guns or fake guns to get their own money
[07:16] back to pay for medical bills. And um
[07:20] you know, if you look at what's
[07:21] happening in Argentina, the same thing.
[07:22] So, so, so there's been just so many so
[07:26] many uh as Satoshi would put it,
[07:29] breaches of trust from central banks
[07:31] where where the central bank or banks in
[07:36] general, they they're supposed to have
[07:38] this kind of unwritten contract with
[07:40] people, which is we won't lose your
[07:42] money and we'll give you your money when
[07:44] you need it and when you ask for it upon
[07:48] upon request. And what's been going on
[07:52] is that as as these sovereign countries
[07:56] who are all who all have fiat
[07:59] currencies, they all have uh they all
[08:02] have senior age which is the right to
[08:04] print their own money. And as they have
[08:06] the right to print their own money, they
[08:07] control they control the means of
[08:10] production, right? A communist way to
[08:12] put it. And so, um, the way that I lost
[08:16] my money, my Bitcoin wasn't because I
[08:19] had my keys, right? Um, the way that you
[08:22] lose your Bitcoin is when you let
[08:23] someone else hold your keys for you.
[08:26] And, um, because once and that's the
[08:28] that's the game changer, right? If you
[08:30] can get your Bitcoin, hold your keys,
[08:33] have your own private your own private
[08:35] seed phrase, your backup seed phrase,
[08:39] um, or multi-IG, right? if you want to
[08:41] get more advanced, you can start using
[08:44] multi-IG. Um, which as your stack grows,
[08:47] that that's a really good option to do.
[08:50] Um, and and that way you're you're
[08:53] protected from from banks doing risky
[08:56] things with your money. So, the way that
[08:57] I lost my money or my Bitcoin uh or some
[09:00] of my Bitcoin um was back in
[09:05] 2020 or 2020. Yeah, about 2020. There
[09:08] was a company called BlockFi, right,
[09:10] that came around. I'm sure you've heard
[09:11] of BlockFi. Um, I used to listen to a
[09:14] guy named Anthony Pompiano who used to
[09:17] pump BlockFi, right? Jason Williams, all
[09:19] these guys, you know, whatever. Like
[09:21] that's that was their sponsorships. Um,
[09:25] you know, the plebs, the Bitcoiners, the
[09:26] maxis would be like, you know, not your
[09:28] keys, not your coins. Um, but there were
[09:32] some interesting things that they were
[09:33] doing, right? And the the thing that
[09:36] they would say is back in those days,
[09:39] right? So you got to remember I started
[09:41] getting into Bitcoin in 2019, but I
[09:43] really started studying it in
[09:45] 2017. So it took me about 2 years to
[09:48] really to actually buy Bitcoin before
[09:51] before I actually bought it because back
[09:52] then you didn't have a million podcasts
[09:54] that were, you know, Bitcoin maxi
[09:57] podcast. You didn't have these books
[09:58] like Safeodine came out with a Bitcoin
[10:00] standard in 2018, you know. So in 2017,
[10:04] you didn't even have it was like, you
[10:07] know, it was this thing for nerds and I
[10:10] have a basketball background. Like I
[10:12] played basketball
[10:13] overseas. Um, you know, and so I I
[10:17] didn't have like a technical background
[10:18] at all. Um, so I wasn't very smart with
[10:21] computers. And so for me it was very
[10:23] foreign. Um, what really kind of
[10:25] attracted me was obviously like the NGU
[10:28] number go up. Um and then also as slowly
[10:32] as I started to understand more about
[10:33] Austrian economics, as I started to
[10:36] understand about macroeconomics,
[10:38] um and you know going down bonds and and
[10:42] all that stuff, fixed income, it made a
[10:44] lot more sense about what Bitcoin
[10:45] was. So in those days, this is I'm
[10:48] getting long-winded, but in those days,
[10:50] what was going on is BlockFi had the
[10:52] greatest messaging, right? the greatest
[10:54] messaging which was you know Mount Gaus
[10:58] was back in 201 whatever
[11:02] 2013 2014 whenever Mount Gaus failed and
[11:06] then there was the quadrigas right
[11:08] quadrriga was another bitcoin exchange
[11:10] that failed in Canada and so these
[11:14] things were happen like these things
[11:15] have happened along the way where people
[11:17] will take your bitcoin they'll they'll
[11:18] custody your bitcoin and then they'll
[11:21] run risky games with your bitcoin and
[11:23] then they'll lose lose your Bitcoin. And
[11:25] so their their whole saying was this is
[11:28] totally different now. Like these are
[11:31] these are institutions that are holding
[11:33] your Bitcoin. They have risk management.
[11:36] They have people that have their whole
[11:37] careers and backgrounds in finance, you
[11:40] know, and it was very it was very
[11:43] attractive, you know, what they were
[11:45] saying. store your Bitcoin here. You'll
[11:48] get some yield off your Bitcoin, you
[11:51] know, put your Bitcoin in here and get
[11:53] a, you know, and finance it out. You'll
[11:55] get a you'll get fiat back. You can pay
[11:58] your fiat down, like you can pay your
[12:00] loan off, refinance it as your Bitcoin
[12:02] goes back up. Um, all these different
[12:05] things that they were saying and it was
[12:07] very interesting and um and so I put
[12:10] some Bitcoin in there. I was trying to
[12:11] run like the Bitcoin play of, okay, if I
[12:14] put my Bitcoin in here and the Bitcoin
[12:16] price goes up to here, you know, then I
[12:19] can I can pay off the loan and then, you
[12:22] know, you're just running all these
[12:24] different games. And so, um, then
[12:27] BlockFi failed, right? Then they failed
[12:30] because what were they doing? they were,
[12:32] you know, they were relying on FTX,
[12:34] which FTX failed, which FTX was probably
[12:37] relying on Luna, which Luna failed
[12:39] before FTX failed, and Celsius. So, you
[12:42] had all of these cascading
[12:44] uh things happening where, you know,
[12:46] that's that's something that we'll
[12:47] probably end up seeing in the fiat
[12:49] system. And that was one of the reasons
[12:50] why I got away from fiat was because
[12:52] that's what I was foreseeing is all
[12:53] these banks would cascade and fall and
[12:55] fail. Um, and then I'm putting my
[12:58] Bitcoin up for risk in the same exact
[13:00] environment running fiat games with my
[13:02] Bitcoin, which makes no sense
[13:04] whatsoever. Um, so I guess the long way
[13:07] to put it is, uh, you know, I kind of I
[13:10] got duped, right? I got duped into
[13:12] believing that giving up my keys, giving
[13:16] up the custody of my Bitcoin to someone
[13:19] else or to an institution would have
[13:21] been smarter than me just holding my own
[13:23] money. And again, it's the it's the old
[13:25] saying, not your keys, not your coins.
[13:27] And so today, we're saying we're seeing
[13:29] a lot of similar things, right? There's
[13:31] going to be more
[13:32] companies that tell you, you know, put
[13:34] your Bitcoin here and and we're going to
[13:36] give you a yield, right? We're going to
[13:38] give you a yield on your Bitcoin. But
[13:39] the question is, where does a yield come
[13:41] from? Because there's only 21 million
[13:43] bitcoins. So, if everyone's getting a
[13:44] yield on their Bitcoin, how how does
[13:47] that work? Like, how does how can
[13:50] everyone get a yield on something that's
[13:52] absolutely scarce? it. Bitcoin is
[13:54] savings. It's not. It doesn't produce a
[13:56] dividend. It doesn't produce a yield.
[13:59] And you have to produce your own
[14:01] dividends in life. And that's kind of
[14:02] what I the lesson that I learned through
[14:05] all of it was, you know, I need to just
[14:08] be a little bit more humble, which, you
[14:09] know, this isn't normally like the the
[14:11] talk that you hear when you're listening
[14:13] about Bitcoin. It's normally it's like
[14:15] people going online talking about how
[14:16] you have to be riskier or you got to DJN
[14:19] or this is life-changing wealth which it
[14:21] is life-changing wealth. Um but my
[14:24] message has just been and the lesson
[14:26] that I learned was I have to increase my
[14:29] earning potential. I have to increase my
[14:32] skills in just in the world and I have
[14:36] to provide a skill or a talent or some
[14:40] type of business that will produce more
[14:42] income for me so then I can stack my
[14:45] Bitcoin and uh and that's what I've
[14:47] done, you know, over the last few years.
[14:48] I'm earning more money now than I ever
[14:50] have, more fiat money, and that helps me
[14:53] stack more Bitcoin. And um and that's my
[14:56] message is just, you know, don't play
[14:58] the risky games with your Bitcoin. It's
[15:01] not worth it because the bull market
[15:02] promises are very pretty. They're very
[15:05] sweet. They're very attractive. Uh and
[15:08] the bare market pain is it's it is
[15:11] something that is very hard to to get
[15:14] through. It took me about two years to
[15:16] kind of just get to that Bitcoin Zen
[15:20] portion of it's like that Bitcoin's
[15:22] gone. it's not coming back. And um and
[15:26] I'm okay with it, right? Because I
[15:27] learned a lesson. If I didn't learn a
[15:28] lesson, maybe I would be a little upset
[15:30] still. Um but I'm happy with where I am
[15:33] and that I get to keep stacking uh even
[15:36] with Bitcoin at, you know, 106,000 or
[15:39] whatever it is right now. This is it's
[15:40] still so low. So you're just 100% in
[15:44] Bitcoin and don't have any Bitcoin
[15:47] related products or anything other than
[15:49] that?
[15:50] Um, so I'm not going to lie, maybe I do
[15:53] maybe I'm not maybe I'm haven't been the
[15:55] smartest. Um, I do have a couple
[15:57] different um, you know, I I do get
[16:01] stocks from the company that I work at.
[16:03] Um, and so I have that and then I do
[16:06] have a little bit in a couple of the
[16:08] other stocks, but in all honesty, it's
[16:11] like it's a very tiny percentage. Like
[16:13] very very tiny. And um, my main goal is
[16:17] stacking Bitcoin. So, I don't I don't
[16:19] stack anything. I have a couple things
[16:22] that I have. Um, but you know, I put up
[16:26] a big percentage of my stack before. Um,
[16:29] and I think that's something I learned
[16:31] about is, you know, don't like it's not
[16:33] worth it. Like, make sure that you're
[16:35] focusing on what's what's your big
[16:37] stack. You don't need to hit a home run
[16:40] on some random leverage play. Um the the
[16:45] biggest asymmetrical bet in my mind
[16:47] still is Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself because
[16:49] it's the it is the safest bet and it's
[16:53] going to keep moving very fast and
[16:56] there's always going to be these micro
[16:58] strategies or these you know the 21
[17:02] capital or the whatever you know Dylan
[17:04] is running in in Japan. I think like
[17:08] that just was like had a ton of MGU this
[17:11] morning. Um, so there's always going to
[17:14] be different stocks that pump or or
[17:17] different altcoins even that pump. Um,
[17:20] but I don't do I have no altcoins, you
[17:23] know, just Bitcoin only. And um, and
[17:26] that is where I'm stacking, right? That
[17:28] is my focus is just stacking Bitcoin.
[17:31] Um, and you know, no trading, none of
[17:33] that stuff.
[17:35] Do you think that those stocks like 21
[17:38] Capital, MSDR, MSDY and all those I call
[17:44] it Bitcoin related financial products
[17:47] are kind of a distraction in a similar
[17:49] sense as in previous bull markets.
[17:52] Altcoins and FDX and Celsius were
[17:55] distractions. Um I don't think that
[17:58] they're on the same level. I think that
[18:01] I think that they do a good job of
[18:03] promoting Bitcoin actually, which which
[18:06] is great because people are starting to
[18:07] see, okay, what is what's going on right
[18:10] here, right? And and some of these
[18:12] companies might blow up, right? Like I
[18:14] think that there's some of these
[18:15] companies that are going to end up not
[18:17] it's not going to work out for him. I
[18:19] think that Sailor is a very smart
[18:21] individual. Uh probably smarter than
[18:23] everybody else. And I don't think that
[18:25] Micro Strategy is going to blow up
[18:27] because I think he's been able to figure
[18:28] out how to his his whole thing is he is
[18:33] betting that he will always be able to
[18:36] borrow money from the fiat system. And
[18:39] so I think people think that he is going
[18:41] to have to sell Bitcoin to pay off his
[18:44] loans. I don't think that's the case. I
[18:47] think what he's going to do is he's
[18:48] going to keep borrowing more money to
[18:51] pay off the loans and then buy Bitcoin
[18:54] with the excess, right? Because he'll
[18:55] start having some some of his loans
[18:58] should be coming due pretty soon, right?
[19:00] I'm not sure when that is, but he
[19:02] started he started doing some of these
[19:04] plays back in 2020 or 2021. And um and
[19:09] so some of his some of his loans should
[19:11] be coming due or maybe they're 10-year
[19:13] loans. I'm not exactly sure what they
[19:15] are, but I think that he is uh figured
[19:18] out a way where he can he's doing what
[19:20] the Fed is doing essentially. It's like
[19:22] look, the Fed prints more money to pay
[19:25] off their debts and then they print more
[19:28] money to pay off those debts. what every
[19:29] central bank is doing. And I think
[19:31] that's what Sailor has figured out that
[19:32] he can kind of be as a stock, as a
[19:35] publicly traded stock, he can run a lot
[19:37] of different plays where he can
[19:38] essentially print more of his stock to
[19:42] to pay off or or borrow money uh and
[19:45] borrow it very cheap, sometimes at 0%,
[19:48] and then pay off his old loans and
[19:50] refinance everything and then just keep
[19:52] it going as Bitcoin's price continues to
[19:54] rise. So, I think he's kind of figured
[19:56] that out, but um maybe he hasn't. Uh I
[20:00] don't think I don't think they're
[20:01] distractions. I do think they are
[20:04] distractions for quote unquote retail,
[20:07] like regular people like you and me. Uh
[20:09] because we don't need to we don't need
[20:11] to buy uh all these different uh Bitcoin
[20:15] exposure uh plays. We can just buy
[20:18] Bitcoin, right? And like those to me
[20:21] those stocks are for people who or
[20:24] institutions who have mandates that
[20:26] can't buy Bitcoin. And so if all of your
[20:29] stack is in Micro Strategy or all of
[20:32] your stack is in 21 Capital Micro
[20:34] Strategy, IBIT, you know, ETFs, and you
[20:39] don't own any Bitcoin, you don't hold
[20:41] your keys, um, you're doing something
[20:44] wrong, right? like you're doing
[20:45] something extremely wrong because you're
[20:47] missing you're missing the point which
[20:50] is Micro Strategy isn't doing stock
[20:54] buybacks, right? They're selling their
[20:57] stock to buy Bitcoin. They're borrowing
[21:00] money not to buy more Micro Strategy
[21:02] stock. They're borrowing money to buy
[21:04] more Bitcoin. 21 Capital is borrowing
[21:06] money to buy more Bitcoin. All these all
[21:09] of these companies are doing, what are
[21:11] they doing? They're buying Bitcoin. And
[21:14] so have the same strategy, right? The
[21:16] strategy should be everyone else is
[21:18] buying Bitcoin, which is the only finite
[21:20] thing. The the CEOs can dilute the
[21:23] shareholders, but there's Satoshi is not
[21:26] coming back to dilute Bitcoin. And so
[21:29] that's the difference in my mind is
[21:31] there's one thing that is absolutely
[21:33] scarce and there's a million other
[21:35] things that they're not. They're not
[21:36] scarce. Yeah. and Satoshi even if he
[21:39] comes back cannot even dilute uh the
[21:42] shareholders the the Bitcoin holders in
[21:44] in that race. I think that's the biggest
[21:46] thing because I hear sometimes this
[21:49] argument from from no coiners oh like
[21:51] what if Satoshi comes back and I'm like
[21:53] yeah what if like what does happen like
[21:56] nothing he has no control over the
[21:58] network he might have some bitcoin but
[22:01] the same thing is true for me I have
[22:04] some bitcoin I just because of more
[22:08] bitcoin than maybe someone else I don't
[22:10] have more control over the network than
[22:12] someone else we all have the same voice
[22:14] we We are full note operators. If you
[22:16] don't have a full note, then you have
[22:18] less voice in Bitcoin. Uh but if you
[22:20] have a full full voice full voice full
[22:24] note have a full voice like you you are
[22:27] the same as Michael Sailor. Um maybe
[22:29] more because maybe Michael Sailor
[22:31] doesn't run a note. I don't know. So uh
[22:34] and the same for Satoshi like he does
[22:37] not control the network. He just started
[22:39] it. He just discovered it. However you
[22:41] want to look at it. Well, it's like uh
[22:44] who created the game of chess, right?
[22:46] What if that guy came back and said,
[22:48] "Hey, we're going to change the rules of
[22:50] chess." People like, "Sorry, like,
[22:52] sorry. Sorry, buddy. We already run.
[22:54] We're already playing chess. We've been
[22:56] playing it for years. This is how this
[22:58] is these are the rules to the game of
[23:00] chess. And we're not changing it just
[23:02] because the guy who created it comes
[23:03] back and wants to change the rules.
[23:05] We're already playing. We already know
[23:07] what the rules are, right? There's 21
[23:08] million every 200 every 2016 blocks
[23:12] there's a difficulty adjustment every
[23:14] 210,000 blocks there's a having that is
[23:17] the monetary policy of Bitcoin and you
[23:20] know and that is what it is and so if if
[23:22] Satoshi came back and wanted to change
[23:24] it doesn't even matter because there's
[23:26] too many people that already know what
[23:28] the rules are the rules are transparent
[23:30] and this is the game that we have and
[23:33] it's the best it's the best money that's
[23:36] ever been created it's not perfect. I
[23:38] don't know if you can create perfect
[23:40] money, but it is the closest thing to
[23:42] perfect. And it is it is the solution to
[23:45] fiat. It's the solution to gold. It's
[23:47] the solution to being able to store your
[23:49] wealth in something that lasts forever.
[23:51] 100%. I I couldn't agree more. Um I have
[23:54] an interesting one. Um we we all might
[23:57] have some some big expenses at some
[23:59] point. So I don't know like your car
[24:02] broke down and you really rely on it and
[24:03] you you have to have a car like you have
[24:05] to buy a new car or like have buy an old
[24:07] car um or you are moving and you have to
[24:10] buy new furniture like whatever like the
[24:12] life is happening you you might have to
[24:15] spend in a particular month more than
[24:18] you actually make in that month. And as
[24:20] Bitcoiners, especially those who are
[24:22] almost all in or kind of all in, uh like
[24:25] myself and as I hear almost also like
[24:28] you, um there's two options we basically
[24:31] have. We can sell some of my some of the
[24:34] Bitcoin, do buy the the thing or like
[24:37] get get over that or we can borrow
[24:38] against that. Um, how do you look at
[24:41] that tradeoff of like selling some
[24:44] Bitcoin to uh get the thing or borrowing
[24:47] against your Bitcoin but giving away the
[24:51] the custody of maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of
[24:54] your stack? Uh, and maybe losing more
[24:58] Bitcoin in the end than than actually
[25:00] you you would have lost if you just sold
[25:02] some. Um, how do you look at that
[25:04] tradeoff uh when it comes to I have to
[25:07] buy something in my life?
[25:10] So, um, I mean, that's a great that's a
[25:13] really great question because that's
[25:14] that's what a lot of people wonder,
[25:15] right? I've been stacking for four
[25:17] years. I got a lot of Bitcoin saved up.
[25:21] You know, I hate selling my Bitcoin. So,
[25:23] what am I going to do, right? Am I going
[25:24] to sell the Bitcoin or am I going to go
[25:27] borrow against it? I think um you just
[25:31] have to be honest with yourself with
[25:33] what you're doing, right?
[25:35] um borrowing against it is very risky.
[25:39] And the reason why borrowing against it
[25:41] is risky is
[25:43] because you know any any loan that you
[25:45] do is
[25:47] overcolateralized. An overcolateralized
[25:49] loan that means that and and this is how
[25:52] it's been right with Bitcoin because
[25:54] Bitcoin's price moves up and down. It's
[25:56] so volatile. They always make you
[25:58] overcolateralize your loan. So, say you
[26:01] wanted, say you wanted, you know,
[26:04] $20,000 of Bitcoin. You're remodeling
[26:06] your home, right? You need $20,000 of
[26:08] Bitcoin. Well, you have to put $40,000
[26:11] of Bitcoin into this exchange, right?
[26:15] So, someone else custodies it. Someone
[26:17] else has the keys to $40,000 of your
[26:20] Bitcoin during that time. Now, what
[26:23] what's interesting is you're probably
[26:25] taking out a loan and you're paying 10
[26:28] nine, you know, nine or 10 or 11 or 12%
[26:32] uh for this loan, right? And you're
[26:34] paying because you have a payment that
[26:36] you have to make every single month on
[26:39] on the on this loan because you have to
[26:42] pay it back, right? Like you eventually
[26:44] have to pay back the loan that you're
[26:46] taking out. when you pay it back then
[26:48] you can either refinance it again or you
[26:51] can you know take your take control of
[26:53] your bitcoin. Um, so first of all, what
[26:58] can happen as you put your money into
[27:00] Bitcoin? You put your Bitcoin into
[27:02] Bitcoin. Are we in a bull market right
[27:03] now? Are we in a bare market? Right? Do
[27:05] we know? Like if it was in November of
[27:08] 2021, did we know that the bare market
[27:11] was about to start and that Bitcoin was
[27:13] going from from 69,000 all the way down
[27:16] to 15,000. So what happens is as the
[27:21] price goes down, so say now you the
[27:25] price of Bitcoin that you have that's
[27:27] over collateralized goes from
[27:30] $40,000 and the price of Bitcoin gets
[27:32] cut in half. Now it goes to 20. Well,
[27:34] now you have to put up more Bitcoin. So
[27:37] you're back up at $40,000 of Bitcoin,
[27:40] right? That's collateralized. You have
[27:42] to post more collateral. And if you
[27:45] don't have any more Bitcoin during that
[27:47] time, say you only have $40,000 of
[27:50] Bitcoin, that's your whole stack. Okay.
[27:52] Well, you don't have any more Bitcoin to
[27:54] post as collateral as Bitcoin goes down.
[27:56] So, the price of Bitcoin goes down, um
[27:59] you risk what's called a margin call.
[28:01] And if you get margin called, what they
[28:04] essentially say is all this Bitcoin that
[28:07] you've posted as collateral is now ours,
[28:09] right? That money is ours. keep your
[28:12] fiat and now it's so what you've done is
[28:14] you've traded $40,000 of Bitcoin for
[28:18] $20,000 of
[28:19] fiat. Good luck, you know, and then
[28:21] you're doing this whole remodel. You're
[28:23] like, I'm going to pay it off and blah
[28:25] blah blah and you end up losing it all.
[28:28] Um, another thing that can happen during
[28:31] that time. So again, so you have you
[28:32] have to post twice as much as what you
[28:34] have. You have to pay a loan. that's
[28:35] like 12%
[28:37] um that that you're that you're paying
[28:40] on what you've on what you've received.
[28:42] You risk a margin call. Another thing is
[28:45] someone else holds your keys. So, you
[28:47] don't know what they're doing with your
[28:48] Bitcoin. One thing that was interesting
[28:50] with with BlockFi, right? You put your
[28:53] Bitcoin into a BlockFi and you post it
[28:54] as a as collateral for for a loan if you
[28:57] want to borrow against it. You put it in
[29:00] there then as soon like you want to
[29:02] verify where your Bitcoin is. You can't
[29:04] like you want to verify in your node.
[29:06] Okay, I'm going to go I'm going to go on
[29:08] my node. I'm going to go verify where my
[29:10] Bitcoin is. It's as soon as you send it
[29:13] in and post it, they've taken it and
[29:16] sent it somewhere else. And now it's
[29:19] almost like a coin join. You have no
[29:20] idea where that Bitcoin went. One thing
[29:23] that um someone like Strike is saying is
[29:26] we're like you're going to have
[29:27] transparency when you post your Bitcoin
[29:30] as collateral. We're going to give you
[29:32] transparency and it's going to be in
[29:34] this where you can verify on your node
[29:36] that your Bitcoin is where it should be,
[29:40] right? That doesn't mean that you own
[29:41] the keys to it though. At any any point
[29:43] in time, they can take your they can
[29:45] take your Bitcoin and move it to
[29:46] wherever they want to. Um, and then that
[29:49] becomes a scary situation. So, someone
[29:51] owns your keys. You can't really verify
[29:53] where your Bitcoin is normally. I guess
[29:55] you can now if you do it with Strike. um
[29:58] you have a 12% loan that you're paying
[30:02] uh and you're always in a worry if
[30:04] Bitcoin drops 50% or if the bull market
[30:07] is over what what's happened in every
[30:09] bare market is the price of Bitcoin gets
[30:12] cut by like 70 80%. So those are the
[30:16] things that you have to that you have to
[30:18] worry about. If you time it really well
[30:20] then yeah then then you've done a great
[30:22] job right? If you time at the bottom of
[30:24] the bull market or the bottom of the
[30:26] bare market, you can ride that up. You
[30:29] don't have to worry about a margin call,
[30:31] you know? You can like chip away some of
[30:33] your Bitcoin and pay off that loan
[30:34] because your Bitcoin's just gone up like
[30:36] 10x, you know? Um, but why not just
[30:40] stack the Bitcoin during that time?
[30:42] That's the bet that you're making if you
[30:43] just buy the Bitcoin. Uh me personally,
[30:46] ever since I was, you know, since I was
[30:49] a part of BlockFi and I lost my Bitcoin,
[30:52] which I did post as collateral and then
[30:55] I posted more Bitcoin as collateral
[30:57] because the price was dropping and then
[30:59] BlockFi just ended up going bust, right?
[31:02] So, you know, in the middle after I've
[31:04] already posted Bitcoin and posted
[31:06] Bitcoin, um it's the worst case
[31:09] scenario, right? you're posting you
[31:11] posted twice as much Bitcoin to get the
[31:14] fiat and then you and then the price of
[31:16] Bitcoin drops you go okay I'm going to
[31:18] dig into my stack I have to post more
[31:20] because I don't want to lose this
[31:21] Bitcoin that I have then it drops then
[31:23] you have to post more Bitcoin again
[31:26] right like as it drops you have to
[31:28] continually add more Bitcoin and
[31:30] collateralize that as you do that then
[31:34] you then one day you wake up and you go
[31:37] this company is going to die
[31:40] And now I could either pay off this
[31:44] loan, which I have to sell bit more
[31:46] Bitcoin to pay off the loan to get my
[31:48] Bitcoin back. But I'm worried that in
[31:51] the moment that I pay off my because it
[31:53] takes like a week. So it takes a week
[31:56] for them to for me to pay off the loan
[31:58] for them to give me my Bitcoin back.
[32:00] What happens if during that week I pay
[32:02] off my loan and the company goes bust?
[32:06] And when I had that idea, the company
[32:09] went bust that week. So, uh, I was like,
[32:13] well, I'm glad at least I didn't pay off
[32:14] that loan and then I would have lost
[32:16] even more Bitcoin. So, those are the
[32:19] risks that you run, which it it like
[32:21] during a bull market, it feels like
[32:23] every again, the bull market promises
[32:25] are pretty and they're sweet and they
[32:28] feel like like Bitcoin's never going to
[32:30] be volatile ever again, that it's only
[32:32] going to go up. Um, but in the bare
[32:34] market, you get awakened to to a reality
[32:37] of this is, you know, there's risky
[32:39] things that can happen along the way.
[32:41] Um, I, you know, again, I'm never going
[32:45] to tell people what to do with their
[32:46] money. I believe in that people should
[32:49] be allowed to do what they want to do
[32:50] with their money if they feel like, hey,
[32:52] there's a product out there where I can
[32:54] I can collateralize my Bitcoin and get
[32:56] fiat and I can borrow it and this time
[32:59] is different and Bitcoin's only going
[33:01] up. You know, like the institutions are
[33:03] buying, countries are buying. We're in a
[33:06] super cycle. This is never it's an
[33:08] eternal September. Everyone's going to
[33:10] keep keep working like keep buying
[33:12] Bitcoin. That's great. I I just don't
[33:15] think we're there yet cuz when I go
[33:18] around and I talk to people, they still
[33:20] have no clue what Bitcoin is, you know,
[33:22] like people that I there's I've I've
[33:24] still yet to meet someone for I've been
[33:27] studying Bitcoin since 2017. So for
[33:29] eight years, I've been studying it for
[33:32] six years. I've been I've been an a
[33:34] buyer of Bitcoin and I've still yet to
[33:37] meet to meet someone just randomly,
[33:40] right? Not when I go to like when I go
[33:42] to Bitcoin meetup. Yeah. Okay. And if I
[33:44] go to the Bitcoin conference, yeah, I'll
[33:46] meet true Bitcoiners. But when I'm just
[33:49] out and about doing my daily business,
[33:52] you know, doing my, you know, buying
[33:54] groceries or at work or talking to
[33:57] friends or talking to friends of friends
[33:59] or talking to family or friends of
[34:02] family. I've never met a Bitcoin maxi
[34:06] ever. Ever. Like in this whole eight
[34:09] years, I've never met someone who's been
[34:11] like, "Here's what you got to do. buy
[34:13] Bitcoin, avoid everything else, hold
[34:15] your keys. And so I don't know if we're
[34:18] I still don't know if we're there yet to
[34:20] the point of this is like this is a
[34:22] super cycle. I still feel like there's
[34:24] probably going to be another, you know,
[34:27] at least one more cycle that we're going
[34:28] to go through before uh before we kind
[34:32] of hit this hyperinflation and you hit
[34:34] Bitcoin, you know, really soaring. But
[34:37] um maybe there's going to be a lot more
[34:39] than one cycle left. Maybe it's just
[34:41] cycles forever. Um, so I'm always an
[34:45] advocate of to me for me personally, um,
[34:49] I I got burned doing the whole
[34:51] collateralizing thing and and borrowing
[34:54] against my Bitcoin. I just don't think
[34:56] that the products are very uh I don't
[34:59] think that they're very enticing right
[35:01] now. Maybe as Bitcoin becomes more uh
[35:05] you know, as it becomes less volatile,
[35:08] when it hits like $15 million or $30
[35:11] million, uh then then we're talking
[35:14] about some maybe it becomes less
[35:16] volatile. Uh you're not worried about
[35:18] the huge draw downs and then there's
[35:21] going to be banks that will do it with
[35:24] you, right? That and and you'll get like
[35:26] a 2%
[35:28] uh loan instead of a 12% loan. And I
[35:31] think those then maybe that becomes more
[35:32] attractive. Uh but right now I don't
[35:35] think there's any products out there
[35:37] that really do a good enough job for for
[35:40] you to borrow against your Bitcoin. And
[35:42] so for for me personally, it's just so
[35:45] much easier to just say, "Hey, if I'm in
[35:47] a bind, I need, you know, my car broke
[35:49] down or whatever, let me just chip away
[35:52] and sell the Bitcoin that I need and so
[35:55] I can spend it on what I need." Bitcoin
[35:57] to me is savings. And so when you're,
[36:00] you know, that's what you save things up
[36:01] for. You, you have savings, if you have
[36:04] an emergency, you have a family
[36:06] emergency, or you have an idea, a
[36:09] business that you want to start, right?
[36:11] And so those are the things that I look
[36:13] at. If you have a business that you want
[36:15] to start, you have some savings, you're
[36:17] like, I have to put some of my savings
[36:19] into this business because I want to
[36:21] make it work. You know, that's how I
[36:23] look at it. So, so there's a lot of
[36:25] different reasons um why you you might
[36:28] have to sell your Bitcoin. Um again,
[36:30] make it something that's an emergency or
[36:32] something something that you would sell
[36:34] your savings for in the first place. Um
[36:38] it's not I don't look at it so much as
[36:40] like this is a thing that I need yield
[36:42] on. Um but everyone's everyone's
[36:45] entitled to do whatever they want to do.
[36:48] Um but for me personally, I wouldn't I
[36:50] would never do that. uh I would never
[36:52] borrow against my my Bitcoin until I
[36:55] would could really look at the
[36:57] conditions that I'm putting myself in
[36:59] and evaluate that and understand that
[37:01] okay these are good conditions now you
[37:04] know which again that would be Bitcoin
[37:05] needs to be a lot more stable it needs
[37:07] to be way less volatile which I love the
[37:10] volatility of Bitcoin because the it's
[37:12] volatile to the upside Bitcoin I'm young
[37:15] you know I'm going to be around for
[37:17] another you know 60 years so I want
[37:20] Bitcoin to be volatile for a long time
[37:22] because that's good because when it's
[37:24] volatile, it's volatile to the upside.
[37:26] It's also volatile to the downside, but
[37:27] overall to the upside and um and the
[37:32] loans need to be better, you know,
[37:33] better priced. And so if the loans are
[37:36] so
[37:37] high, you know, it's just to me doesn't
[37:40] make sense right now. Let's take a break
[37:41] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[37:44] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[37:47] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[37:50] most amazing, the most eleigent way of
[37:53] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[37:56] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[37:58] completely new and amazing Genesis
[38:01] edition of their watch collections. You
[38:04] have the date of the first ever minded
[38:07] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[38:09] also the block height and which epoch we
[38:12] are currently in. I love the level of
[38:15] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[38:18] Make sure to check out those amazing
[38:20] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[38:23] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[38:26] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[38:29] really do hope that you don't have it on
[38:31] exchange. But if you do have it on
[38:33] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[38:35] deal with that. The first way is you put
[38:37] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[38:39] entry for you to get into the
[38:42] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[38:45] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[38:48] super simple and secure way. And if you
[38:51] check out the link in the description,
[38:53] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[38:56] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[38:59] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[39:02] partner in terms of how to get the most
[39:05] out of your sovereignty. They will
[39:07] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[39:10] that is perfect for your individual
[39:13] situation. They will show you how you
[39:16] can secure your own devices. Securing
[39:18] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[39:20] have to keep all your devices secure.
[39:23] One topic that is overlooked often is
[39:25] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[39:28] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[39:31] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[39:33] place already? And last but not least,
[39:35] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[39:37] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[39:40] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[39:45] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[39:47] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[39:50] will be for the first time ever speaking
[39:53] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[39:56] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[39:58] really looking forward to seeing all of
[40:00] you there. You can get your ticket in
[40:03] the link down in the description of
[40:05] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[40:07] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[40:11] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[40:13] there. I love those points. I mean, and
[40:15] I mean, you're 100% correct with
[40:17] interest rates are just way too high on
[40:19] on those products. Like uh paying at 12%
[40:22] interest just just doesn't make sense
[40:24] for me. Um especially like if you
[40:27] compare it to
[40:29] other assets collateral that we can use
[40:32] like a house you get a way better loan
[40:35] on that and why is that like just
[40:38] because it's we are early to that whole
[40:40] game because a house real estate is such
[40:43] a worse collateral than Bitcoin. Bitcoin
[40:46] you can liquidate right now in that very
[40:50] second. a house can take months till
[40:52] it's sold and stuff like that. And so
[40:55] it's
[40:56] it's for me it's unimaginable why the
[40:59] rates are so high. I think we're just
[41:00] early to that that whole market where
[41:02] you're early to Bitcoin and you're even
[41:04] earlier to borrowing against your
[41:05] Bitcoin. But I like the point that you
[41:07] brought up that like that's what I got
[41:09] from it. If you transfer your Bitcoin
[41:12] away to someone else that gives you
[41:13] fiat, it's like selling Bitcoin because
[41:16] you don't know what they're doing with
[41:17] it. you you you almost sold your
[41:20] Bitcoin. And then it's the question, do
[41:21] you want to sell $20,000 or $40,000 of
[41:25] Bitcoin? Uh because if you need 20
[41:27] 20,000, you can transfer 20,000 or you
[41:31] transfer 40,000 and and borrow against
[41:33] it and pay interest rates on it and and
[41:36] have that risk. And especially I like
[41:38] that point and that's why I personally
[41:41] uh I'm at the point where I I had to
[41:43] decide do I want to borrow against it or
[41:45] uh sell it because I earn more bitcoin
[41:47] than than I like most of my income is
[41:50] already in bitcoin so I have to sell
[41:51] some uh to cover fiat expenses. Um and I
[41:56] came to the conclusion I want calmness
[41:58] in my life. I want to focus 100% on the
[42:02] things that I do to upscale my earning
[42:05] potential and I want to just have
[42:08] everything in Bitcoin. That that's all.
[42:11] Like I don't have anything else like
[42:13] literally anything like yeah I have a
[42:15] microphone and a computer and stuff like
[42:17] that but like no at all.
[42:22] Yeah. One other thing that and I think
[42:24] the selling points that they that they
[42:26] give you too, right, which is a good
[42:28] selling point is, you know, you don't
[42:30] have to pay taxes when you post your
[42:32] Bitcoin as collateral and get fiat back,
[42:36] which is true, right? Because it's it's
[42:39] not a tax occurring uh event because
[42:42] you're posting your Bitcoin. You're not
[42:44] selling it. But when you sell your
[42:45] Bitcoin, then you also have to pay taxes
[42:47] on top of that, right?
[42:49] So, you know, it maybe one day we get to
[42:52] a point where it makes sense and that
[42:55] would be great if they can get a product
[42:57] that's
[42:57] better. We I'd love that. But I think
[43:00] right now they have to have I mean they
[43:02] have to have these loans that are so
[43:03] high because like like like what you
[43:06] said, most institutions don't understand
[43:08] what's going on with Bitcoin. Um and
[43:11] it's it's not just like, you know, and I
[43:14] don't and I don't know how Strike does
[43:15] it, right? because I haven't done it
[43:16] with them. But with BlockFi, it wasn't
[43:18] like BlockFi gave you the fiat. It's
[43:21] like they partner with an institution
[43:23] and and like that's how it's kind of
[43:26] worked through. This institution gives
[43:28] you that fiat and they give you the fiat
[43:30] like right away. It's kind of nuts and
[43:33] you feel it's this false feeling that
[43:36] you're, oh, I'm so rich now, you know,
[43:39] and I could always post Bitcoin and I
[43:41] could get fiat if I needed it and it
[43:43] doesn't I don't have to pay a tax on it.
[43:45] But then the taxes like the tax that
[43:48] you're paying is the 12% that you're
[43:51] paying like that's the interest rate
[43:52] that you're paying or the tax would be
[43:55] your like the fear right of getting
[43:57] liquidated uh as Bitcoin goes down. The
[44:00] tax like there it's a it's an unknown
[44:02] tax that the unknown tax is much worse
[44:05] than just the known tax. Okay, I'm going
[44:08] to have to pay a tax on selling my
[44:09] Bitcoin. I know what that tax is. and
[44:11] you don't know what the tax is that and
[44:13] and the multiple different types of tax
[44:15] or how it is taxing against you and
[44:18] against your psyche when you're put in a
[44:20] situation where you're like I'm going to
[44:22] get liquidated and I could lose all this
[44:23] Bitcoin. Yeah. is the emotional cost,
[44:27] the hidden emotional cost and the hidden
[44:30] actual cost of like the interest rates
[44:32] uh and and and things like that which is
[44:34] and I also one point I don't like about
[44:36] it it I think it makes the fiat system
[44:39] stronger if we use it more and more and
[44:42] then I know there's this whole
[44:44] speculative attack on on on the fiat
[44:46] system with with opening up that uh
[44:49] black hole and and kind of getting more
[44:52] fear to to get more Bitcoin and it's
[44:55] like a speculative attack on on on the
[44:57] fiat system. But I'm not sure if that's
[44:59] really true. I'm like I think when we
[45:03] use more feared especially also as a
[45:06] mean of exchange especially also as as
[45:09] like those those loan products and
[45:10] financial products in the end of the day
[45:13] I think we make it stronger. May maybe
[45:15] maybe I'm wrong on this. Uh I'm not a
[45:18] macroeconomics, but I I feel like when
[45:21] we use fiat versus using Bitcoin, we we
[45:25] making fiat stronger and not not not
[45:28] Bitcoin.
[45:30] Yeah. I mean, I guess either way you're
[45:31] selling your Bitcoin or you're borrowing
[45:33] against it. And you know, maybe if you
[45:36] were spending the Bitcoin directly, but
[45:39] we're just not really there yet. There's
[45:40] not as many vendors out there. There's
[45:42] not there's not a ton of stake and
[45:43] shakes out there, you know, that are
[45:46] that are accepting Bitcoin. Um but um
[45:50] yeah, it's I don't know if you're making
[45:52] it stronger or not.
[45:54] Um but I I think that uh in the long
[45:58] run, you're just it's just so much
[46:00] easier to just sell the Bitcoin. I mean,
[46:02] think about okay, let's take let's talk
[46:04] about the OGs, right? We're talking
[46:05] about OG's at the beginning. Think about
[46:08] someone who has, say they have a
[46:10] thousand Bitcoin,
[46:12] right? Are they, you know, when they
[46:15] have a life emergency,
[46:18] um, are they borrowing against their
[46:20] Bitcoin or are they just selling some of
[46:23] their Bitcoin? Right? They're like,
[46:24] "Okay, I could sell a quarter of a
[46:26] Bitcoin and now I have
[46:30] 999
[46:31] and.75 Bitcoin instead of a,000
[46:34] Bitcoin." Um, I don't think that those
[46:38] type of people are borrowing against it,
[46:40] right? And so I guess what I'm trying to
[46:42] say is it seems like borrowing against
[46:46] your Bitcoin is like a poor man's move,
[46:49] right? Like buying shitcoins so you can
[46:52] turn that into more Bitcoin is like what
[46:54] a poor person would do. you know, buying
[46:58] uh all these stocks and hoping that you
[47:00] can get rich off of them and then
[47:02] turning it into Bitcoin seems like a
[47:05] poor man's move as well. And so it's
[47:07] like, okay, well, what would a wise man
[47:09] do? Like, what would a smart man do? I
[47:12] think a smart man or a wise man would do
[47:14] what Sailor's doing, which Sailor isn't
[47:17] buying all the stocks and putting it in
[47:19] his treasury, right? He's not buying
[47:21] he's not he's not doing that. He's
[47:23] buying the Bitcoin. He's leveraging
[47:25] other people's money, right, to buy
[47:27] Bitcoin, but he's buying the Bitcoin.
[47:30] And I think that's I think that's what I
[47:33] look at it is, okay, uh, what would a
[47:35] what would a smart person do? What would
[47:37] a sound mind do? And I think a sound
[47:40] mind would say, I think I would just
[47:42] sell a little bit of Bitcoin and I would
[47:45] figure out a way to earn more money. I
[47:47] would figure out a way how to increase
[47:48] my skills. I mean, we live in a time
[47:50] where you can like you can make money
[47:52] online, if you have an internet
[47:54] connection, if you have access to a
[47:57] computer, you can make money in a lot of
[48:00] money online doing a lot of different
[48:02] things. and with access to AI that we
[48:05] have and different and different, you
[48:07] know, so many different things and so
[48:09] many different ways to create a business
[48:12] uh and the knowledge that's out there to
[48:14] me that just makes the most sense to me
[48:16] is why not just increase your skill set
[48:19] and make more money than you've ever
[48:21] made before in your life and then turn
[48:23] that into the Bitcoin. You know, it
[48:24] might take you a year or two years or
[48:26] three years to get there. Um, and people
[48:30] think, and I think part of it is like
[48:32] Bitcoin is going to run up and I'm never
[48:34] going to have a chance. Like people
[48:35] think that they deserve I have to have
[48:37] one Bitcoin and I don't have one Bitcoin
[48:40] right now. So I got to play all these
[48:41] risky games to get one Bitcoin. And then
[48:45] during that process, then they actually
[48:47] lose more Bitcoin than they than what
[48:49] they would have if they would have just
[48:50] focused instead of focusing on how do I
[48:53] flip my Bitcoin and flip these altcoins
[48:55] and flip everything else to get more. if
[48:57] they would have just focused on stacking
[48:59] and and figuring out how to get more
[49:02] money in their job or how to create a
[49:04] business which provides more money or
[49:06] writing a book or or being able to sell
[49:09] something online or creating some type
[49:12] of content, right? Like whatever it is
[49:14] that they need to do, get better at what
[49:16] you're doing or or find something that
[49:18] you can get really good at and offer
[49:20] that to the free market and then let the
[49:23] free market decide if you have any
[49:25] value. And if you do, then great. And if
[49:28] you don't, then keep working at it. And
[49:30] as you continue to work at it, then the
[49:31] free market will reward you. If you give
[49:34] the free market what it needs. And as
[49:36] you do that, um then you can stack way
[49:39] more Bitcoin. And believe me, it's going
[49:42] to be so much better than than than
[49:44] playing these fiat games because the
[49:46] fiat games are not fulfilling. Even if
[49:49] you get rich off of flipping your
[49:52] Bitcoin or doing trading or whatever,
[49:54] it's it like it does it feels fake,
[49:57] right? It doesn't feel real. But if you
[50:00] can work in a job and provide value for
[50:03] others and make a business profitable or
[50:06] operate a profitable business or be a
[50:08] leader of men and women and help others
[50:11] grow and you can run a company and you
[50:15] make money doing that, it's so much more
[50:17] rewarding and and that's the whole point
[50:20] of what money is. Like money like the
[50:22] money is your life's work, you know?
[50:25] It's not this thing where you go on a
[50:27] computer screen and click a button and
[50:29] then all of a sudden you have way more
[50:30] money. No, it's work. It's true work.
[50:33] And it takes time to get good at at
[50:35] providing something of value. And as you
[50:37] do that, uh then then you'll get
[50:40] rewarded very handsomely. And it and
[50:42] then that's when you can start buying
[50:43] the Bitcoin uh that you feel like you
[50:46] should have been buying by just trading
[50:48] or flipping or or borrowing against it
[50:50] in the first place. I love this message.
[50:52] I think that's I think that's a really
[50:54] good message for for for Bitcoiners like
[50:57] invest in yourself, in your family, and
[51:00] in Bitcoin. Like those are the three
[51:02] things that that make sense to invest
[51:04] in. Everything else is is noise at the
[51:07] end of the day. And take away the most
[51:09] valuable thing that you have, your time,
[51:11] because you also have to spend time
[51:14] monitoring those loans and and seeing
[51:16] what are they doing and figuring out
[51:17] which one is the best provider and and
[51:19] seeing the risks of that. And I don't
[51:22] even want to do that. Like that's some
[51:25] that's that does seem like a hustle
[51:27] honestly to to to look at all that and
[51:30] continuous like this is something I'm
[51:32] I'm very sure of is if you choose to
[51:36] borrow against your Bitcoin. You have to
[51:38] stay on top of it. You have to look at
[51:40] every month, every quarter of like,
[51:42] okay, what is the company doing? Is it
[51:44] is it like in risk? What is my loan
[51:46] doing? Do I have to post more
[51:48] collateral? What is the Bitcoin price
[51:50] doing? All of a sudden, you have to care
[51:51] for those things. Like, I don't want to
[51:53] care for those things. I just want to
[51:54] buy uh I I just want to earn Bitcoin and
[51:58] have a little bit more Sattorshi each
[52:00] month. That That's all. It's And and
[52:02] that's such a good point, right? It was
[52:04] very interesting. When I was when I had
[52:06] that loan, I had to check the price of
[52:08] Bitcoin every day, multiple times a day.
[52:12] And uh you know, I just made a meme
[52:14] about me checking the price of Bitcoin,
[52:15] but I like I don't I don't check the
[52:18] price of Bitcoin very often. I'll see
[52:21] the price. Oh, someone will post like a
[52:23] chart. Oh, Bitcoin's at 106 or whatever
[52:25] it is right now, but I don't check the
[52:28] price of Bitcoin and people come up to
[52:30] me who know that I'm a Bitcoiner. And
[52:32] they'll go, "Oh, Bitcoin is doing really
[52:33] good today." You know, I'm like, "Oh, it
[52:34] is. I haven't like I haven't even
[52:36] looked." And so, um, I I think it's it's
[52:40] very freeing when you're when you when
[52:43] your life doesn't revolve around the
[52:46] price of Bitcoin. It doesn't revolve
[52:49] around the NGU. You know what's
[52:51] happening. You know what's going to
[52:52] happen. It's going to come. But when
[52:54] you're focused on just stacking at any
[52:56] price because you know that look even if
[52:59] like you got to get to the point where
[53:01] even if we didn't have Bitcoin like
[53:03] Bitcoin can't be the thing that's like
[53:06] that that makes it so you have money. It
[53:09] can't be this thing that saves you, you
[53:12] know. Obviously, it it is like the
[53:15] solution to these terrible fiat systems
[53:18] and fiat has been so overgrown uh like a
[53:22] fungus, you know, throughout the whole
[53:25] world, which makes it very hard to be
[53:27] successful and makes it hard to to be
[53:29] free. But like if you say, I I'm going
[53:34] to first be successful with or without
[53:37] the Bitcoin. and I'm going to be able to
[53:38] make money with or without the Bitcoin.
[53:41] And then you and then you can do that
[53:44] and then put your work and your wealth
[53:46] into Bitcoin. That is the ultimate key
[53:50] in my in my opinion. That is how you
[53:52] really that's how you truly become free
[53:55] because you don't need the NGU like like
[53:59] you need the Bitcoin because it's
[54:01] permissionless. You need the Bitcoin
[54:03] because no one can seize it. No one can
[54:04] freeze it. No one can take away your
[54:06] wealth. And then on top of it, Bitcoin
[54:08] will reward you because it is absolutely
[54:11] scarce and it is early and people still
[54:14] haven't figured out what it is. And as
[54:15] they figure out what it is, uh then more
[54:17] people gravitate towards it. Um but most
[54:20] people don't understand money and
[54:22] institutions don't even understand
[54:24] money, right? They understand that
[54:26] there's a game being played, but they
[54:27] don't understand, right? They figured
[54:29] out how stocks work. They figured out
[54:30] how bonds work. They figured out how all
[54:33] these other financial institutions and
[54:36] and and all these other things work, but
[54:38] they haven't figured out how money
[54:39] works. If it was true, then they'd all
[54:41] be buying Bitcoin. And so, as they start
[54:43] to understand the store of value that
[54:45] Bitcoin truly is, then more and more of
[54:48] these companies will and institutions
[54:50] will start buying. But it's still so
[54:52] early. It's like, okay, just become
[54:54] successful. Figure out how to become
[54:57] successful. do that first and then put
[55:00] your savings and your wealth into
[55:01] Bitcoin and then you become unstoppable.
[55:05] I love that messaging. Really cool. Um I
[55:07] want to get also to um we talked a lot
[55:10] about the the bull market and and I
[55:12] think you also discussed before and uh
[55:15] about the bull market promises that that
[55:16] that you're going to see. Um and and
[55:20] it's uh I don't know who who I think
[55:22] Nico from Simply Bitcoin tweeted it out
[55:24] um a couple of months ago. it's the best
[55:28] cycle for news and the worst cycle for
[55:31] for price. How do you look at that bull
[55:33] market versus the previous ones that
[55:35] that you have seen? Um, so you know it's
[55:39] it's it's kind of interesting, right?
[55:40] Cuz I was, you know, I was studying
[55:42] Bitcoin when it went up to 20K in
[55:45] 2017, then it went down to like, you
[55:49] know, 3,000 or 4,000 and then and then
[55:52] it was like hanging out around 10,000
[55:54] when I started buying in 2019.
[55:57] Um, and then it went down during COVID,
[56:01] uh, in 2020 went down back down to like
[56:04] $4,000 or $4,500 if I remember
[56:07] correctly. It dropped like 50% in one
[56:09] day. And um and then it started to climb
[56:13] back up and um then we got all the way,
[56:18] you know, it went down to like 4,000 in
[56:20] 2020 and by the end of 2021 it was like
[56:22] at 69,000 and so it did more than 10x,
[56:26] right? And in those days like you didn't
[56:29] have you didn't like in 2017 you had
[56:32] like no companies buying Bitcoin. You
[56:34] had no countries even interested in
[56:36] Bitcoin. Um, and then in 2021, you had
[56:40] uh like sailors started buying in
[56:42] August. Micro Strategy started buying in
[56:44] August of 2020, right? Um, and so that
[56:48] was after COVID and I think his first
[56:51] buys were like at 11,000 and then it
[56:54] dropped to 10,000 and everyone was
[56:56] freaking out. Oh, he's lost all this
[56:58] like not Bitcoiners but you know the
[57:00] media. Oh, he's made this huge bet and
[57:02] he's lost all this money and then he
[57:04] bought more when it dropped from like 11
[57:06] to 10 or 11 to 9,000 and and that's what
[57:09] sailor has been doing this whole time,
[57:11] right? He just keeps buying and then uh
[57:14] you know and then you also had in 2021
[57:18] you had El Salvador said, "Okay, we're
[57:20] going to start buying." They started
[57:21] buying in September of
[57:23] 2021 and you know they basically started
[57:26] buying at the top which is fine because
[57:28] then they bought all the way down and
[57:30] now they've been buying all the way back
[57:31] up and they were hated on for a few
[57:33] years but I agree like those times you
[57:35] only had like El Salvador and Micro
[57:37] Strategy in the last bull markets and
[57:39] Bitcoin's doing crazy numbers right from
[57:41] the bottom to the top way more than a
[57:44] 10x and so if you think okay from the
[57:46] bottom of this cycle which was like 15k
[57:49] well 10x would be1
[57:51] 150K. Um, and you're not seeing you're
[57:54] not seeing the crazy growth when you're
[57:56] seeing like, okay, Micro Strategy is
[57:58] like on steroids of how they used to be
[58:00] mining Bitcoin. You have 21 Capital
[58:02] coming out. You have Bhutan, some random
[58:05] country in Asia, right, saying they're
[58:06] mining Bitcoin. El Salvador is just
[58:09] bragging about how much Bitcoin they're
[58:11] buying. you have, you know, Dylan's
[58:13] running this company that they're buying
[58:15] Bitcoin in Japan while Japan is like
[58:17] going through a a debt like a sovereign
[58:20] currency crisis. And so you have all of
[58:23] these crazy things that are going on
[58:25] where yeah, there's way more companies
[58:27] buying Bitcoin. Um, and every day you
[58:30] look up, there's a new company buying
[58:32] it. And so, um, I think Nikico's spot
[58:36] on. It's it's been the most interesting.
[58:38] Plus the ETFs, right? Like don't forget
[58:40] about the ETFs that are going on. Um so
[58:43] it makes you wonder if these people are
[58:45] actually buying Bitcoin, right? Like
[58:47] that is the true question. Uh are they
[58:50] buying Bitcoin or are they buying IUs to
[58:53] their Bitcoin? Are they custodying it?
[58:55] Are they verifying on chain that they're
[58:57] actually buying Bitcoin or are these
[59:00] just a bunch of IUS like how they did
[59:02] paper gold? Is this paper papered over
[59:06] Bitcoin? Because you would think that
[59:08] the price would be pumping a lot harder.
[59:10] Maybe as the price is pumping, there's a
[59:12] lot of OGs that are selling, right?
[59:14] There's you're going to have OGs that
[59:16] sell. Like that's like that's just
[59:17] natural, right? If you become if you're
[59:20] worth nothing, right? You've been like a
[59:23] janitor, but you knew you knew what
[59:25] Bitcoin was and now you have your net
[59:29] worth is like $75 million or $100
[59:32] million. you're not going to go out and
[59:34] buy, you know, some ranch or a property.
[59:37] You're not going to sell some of your
[59:39] Bitcoin. And that's the thing is like
[59:40] when I started getting into it, it was
[59:42] all about, oh, Bitcoin is in a few
[59:44] hands. It's not decentralized because
[59:46] it's so centralized. And it's like,
[59:48] well, you don't understand what those
[59:49] even mean. And um and so I I think there
[59:54] are OGs that are selling, which is great
[59:56] for Bitcoin because then it moves it's
[59:59] Bitcoin will naturally move hands. And
[60:02] to those who maybe don't feel like they
[60:04] have enough Bitcoin, they're still
[60:05] trying to stack and grow their
[60:07] percentage. And for those who feel like,
[60:09] you know, I kind of have my stack. Those
[60:12] those are the people that are selling,
[60:14] you know, but um I would say I I kind of
[60:17] agree with Nico. It is really
[60:19] interesting to see how many institutions
[60:22] and countries now are starting to buy
[60:24] Bitcoin. And like you feel like, oh,
[60:26] like there's like is Saudi Arabia
[60:28] buying? is there these other countries
[60:30] that are buying, but they're buying on
[60:32] like down on the down low and no one
[60:34] knows about it yet. That's probably the
[60:36] best strategy. United States is like,
[60:38] "Yeah, we're going to start buying."
[60:41] Whatever that means. Like the SPR really
[60:43] didn't didn't prove to be anything that
[60:45] I that I thought it could have been or
[60:47] that it maybe should have been, but I
[60:49] think that's better overall that the
[60:50] United States, even though I'm American,
[60:52] I'm glad that there's not this huge
[60:54] country buying Bitcoin just yet. Um, so
[60:58] there could be a lot of paper buying, I
[61:00] guess, is what I'm trying to say. Um,
[61:03] maybe there's not, but you would think
[61:05] that the price of Bitcoin would be going
[61:06] up like to 200K or 300K with all of
[61:11] these announcements that keep happening.
[61:14] Yeah,
[61:15] it's like I don't I don't think
[61:17] personally that they actually do it, but
[61:20] the the more and more they buy and the
[61:24] the less the price moves, the more
[61:27] suspicious I
[61:28] get of of exactly that the the thing
[61:32] that that why for example Black Rockck
[61:34] like what incentive would they have to
[61:37] they have so much money um uh if there's
[61:41] something fishy going on like also with
[61:43] coin I don't think I I don't know. It's
[61:46] It's really hard like why why would they
[61:48] do it if they risk everything to to get
[61:51] a little bit more because Coinbase has a
[61:53] great business
[61:55] model. Black Rock has a great business
[61:57] model. Um but yeah, it's it's something
[62:01] interesting going on. Maybe it's also
[62:02] just like the lack of retail interest
[62:05] currently, but this this does not move
[62:07] the price. Black Rockck should should
[62:09] move the price way more. So, it's an
[62:11] interesting thing. Yeah, you would think
[62:14] that, you know, institutions are ran by
[62:17] people, right? And so I it would make
[62:21] sense that in this kind of first
[62:23] institutional wave, uh, you're going to
[62:26] have these institutions act the same way
[62:28] that retail acts, just at a bigger
[62:29] level, right? That countries are going
[62:32] to act the same way that retail acts,
[62:33] just at a bigger level. And so like it
[62:36] would make sense to me that we're going
[62:37] to have these runups, but it's
[62:39] institutional runup and then that
[62:41] they're going to sell because they're
[62:42] scared or they don't know what to do or
[62:44] they feel like they timed it right and
[62:46] they're going to get in in the trade and
[62:47] then they're going to take profits and
[62:49] get out of the trade because they don't
[62:51] really understand what it is that they
[62:53] own just yet. And so you would imagine
[62:56] that there would be uh institutions kind
[62:58] of doing a similar thing.
[63:01] Um, you know, I would imagine, and maybe
[63:05] I'm giving too much credit to Michael
[63:06] Sailor, but again, I guess maybe I've
[63:08] become a big Michael Sailor fan. So, I
[63:11] would imagine that he is verifying on
[63:14] chain that Coinbase actually has his
[63:17] Bitcoin. I would imagine that that's
[63:19] going on. Um, with other institutions,
[63:23] I'm just not so sure, right? Am I so
[63:25] sure that a Black Rockck is verifying on
[63:28] chain that Coinbase is is custodying
[63:31] their Bitcoin? I I feel like there could
[63:34] be a lot of trust going on. Um I could
[63:36] be, you know, in all of those ETFs. I
[63:39] feel like there could be a lot of trust
[63:41] between these ETFs and Coinbase or
[63:44] whoever that they're actually buying the
[63:46] Bitcoin they're verifying on chain and
[63:49] or who's to say that you know that
[63:52] they're telling one ETF and another ETF
[63:55] and they're pointing to the same address
[63:57] and they're saying here's your Bitcoin,
[63:59] right? How do they, you know, how like a
[64:02] proof of reserve is an interesting thing
[64:03] because a proof of reserve if two
[64:06] parties don't know um and and it's kind
[64:09] of kept private. A proof of reserve
[64:10] could be if Coinbase is custodying, you
[64:14] know, 10 different ETFs, Bitcoin, but
[64:18] then they point to the same addresses.
[64:20] Here's your Bitcoin. Here's your
[64:21] Bitcoin. And then they can go and
[64:22] verify, okay, there's Bitcoin there.
[64:24] Well, they don't control the keys to
[64:25] that Bitcoin. So, how do they know that
[64:27] that's their Bitcoin and it's not
[64:29] another ETF's Bitcoin or it's not
[64:31] Coinbase is holding Bitcoin? So, how do
[64:33] they know for sure and they won't and
[64:35] the answer is they don't, right? They
[64:36] don't know. And so, that could be
[64:38] another way um that trust is being
[64:41] implemented into the system when you're
[64:44] using a custodian. That's those are the
[64:46] issues that you can run into. And so um
[64:50] there there that's why I would just be a
[64:53] little weary that I don't know for sure
[64:56] if all the Bitcoin that they say is
[64:58] getting bought is actually getting
[64:59] bought or if it's just getting papered
[65:01] over.
[65:03] Yeah, we need public transparency for
[65:05] proof of proof of reserve of saying hey
[65:09] those are the five biggest positions and
[65:11] this is the address for that and for all
[65:14] the rest of it like there is some
[65:16] another address. So like there like
[65:18] proof of reserve I think will have to be
[65:22] the standard at some point because
[65:23] people will not trust anyone holding
[65:26] their Bitcoin at some point if they
[65:30] cannot even prove if they actually hold
[65:33] it. Yeah. like the guy for Micro
[65:35] Strategy who's not Michael Sailor is
[65:37] like a like a different guy who's kind
[65:39] of I don't know if I don't think he's
[65:40] the CEO but I think he runs some
[65:43] different I don't know what he does but
[65:45] he was posting on Twitter and people
[65:49] were trying to get trying to get Micro
[65:51] Strategy Micro Strategy to to post proof
[65:54] of reserves and then he comes out and he
[65:57] goes and he gives them like their 10 Q
[65:59] or whatever which is like their filing
[66:01] to the SEC government, right? to the SEC
[66:04] and they go, "Okay." He goes, "Well, in
[66:07] the in here it says that we own the
[66:09] Bitcoin, right? In this government
[66:12] document it says that we own the
[66:14] Bitcoin." And like that's not proof of
[66:15] reserves, buddy. Like you like, "Show us
[66:18] the addresses. Show us the addresses.
[66:20] That's the proof of reserve." And so,
[66:23] yeah, imagine if Coinbase came out for
[66:25] everyone that they that they custody
[66:26] Bitcoin for and they said, "Here's the
[66:29] proof of reserves for the addresses for
[66:31] Micro Strategy. Here's for for the ETF
[66:35] for Black Rockck for IBIT and here's for
[66:37] this other ETF and this other ETF and
[66:39] this other ETF. Then plebs could go
[66:42] around or Bitcoiners could go around and
[66:43] actually verify, okay, these are all
[66:45] this is all correct. You know, the
[66:47] Bitcoin is actually in these addresses
[66:50] and this is addresses for this one, this
[66:52] address is for that one. But if it's
[66:55] kind of all done behind closed doors,
[66:58] how does M like how does Micro Strategy
[67:01] know? And see this is the this is the
[67:03] big point too for Michael Sailor even if
[67:07] Coinbase comes to him and says we are
[67:09] custodying your Bitcoin and they give
[67:12] him proof of reserve and the address.
[67:15] How does he know that that's not IBIT's
[67:18] Bitcoin? That he How does he know that
[67:20] that's not Coinbase's Bitcoin? How does
[67:22] he know that's not anyone else's Bitcoin
[67:24] other than his because he doesn't have
[67:26] the keys? So, that like that is a really
[67:29] interesting thing to think about. Um,
[67:32] when it comes to proof of reserves, if
[67:33] you're a custodian, you can't just give
[67:36] these private proof of reserves back to
[67:39] whoever you're custodying for, you
[67:41] actually would need to make it public so
[67:43] everyone could verify. And if there's
[67:45] another company that you're custodying
[67:47] for, they can go, "Well, no, that's our
[67:48] address, too." you know, and so as they
[67:51] do that, I don't know what the downfall
[67:54] is. If you're going to come out and say,
[67:56] "We already like if you're going to file
[67:58] in your in your SEC filings, this is how
[68:01] much Bitcoin we hold." What's the
[68:04] downfall to posting a proof of reserve?
[68:07] I don't see the down like I don't
[68:08] understand what the attack vector is
[68:11] because you're already showing that you
[68:13] have Bitcoin, a certain amount of
[68:15] Bitcoin. So, I don't understand what the
[68:16] attack factor is by posting the address
[68:19] to where that Bitcoin is actually held.
[68:22] You know, that doesn't make sense to me
[68:23] or why why they wouldn't do that. It's
[68:25] very true. I think proof of reserve has
[68:28] to be the standard. It it's it's
[68:29] something that if you don't do like
[68:32] there will come a point where if you
[68:34] don't do that, people will not trust in
[68:38] in in
[68:39] in what you are saying. Yeah. Trust will
[68:43] always be replaced by verification.
[68:47] Yeah. And I think and I think that's the
[68:48] issue with Coinbase is because Coinbase
[68:50] has kind of been this leader for like a
[68:52] decade, more than a decade in Bitcoin
[68:55] and crypto, right? Whatever crypto is.
[68:59] And they've been able to create this
[69:01] system where people trust them to
[69:03] custody their Bitcoin or institutions
[69:05] trust them to custody their Bitcoin. And
[69:08] um and it's very interesting cuz they're
[69:11] not they don't really have a Bitcoin
[69:12] ethos at Coinbase. They have a very big
[69:16] fiat ethos at Coinbase. And so maybe
[69:20] it'll take something like Coinbase
[69:22] really blowing up. Although I just don't
[69:25] see how that could happen because now
[69:27] like if you're once you start custodying
[69:29] Bitcoin for like Black Rockck, you got
[69:32] the Federal Federal Reserve uh behind
[69:35] you, you know? So, I don't know how
[69:37] they'll blow up like an
[69:39] FTX, but again, that was that was the
[69:41] whole thing with BlockFi. The
[69:43] institutions are here. You're safe. And
[69:46] um I I
[69:47] I you can't just play these fiat games
[69:50] forever. And I don't like how Coinbase
[69:52] is kind of trying to control the
[69:54] narrative of this is how the custody
[69:56] should be done cuz I think they're doing
[69:58] it wrong. So maybe there needs to be
[70:01] another company that comes around and
[70:03] can custody better with proof of
[70:05] reserves. And uh maybe that's what the
[70:08] free market needs. So maybe if we're
[70:09] trying to make some money out there to
[70:11] to buy more Bitcoin, maybe we need to
[70:13] create a company that actually custodies
[70:16] Bitcoin for institutions that shows
[70:19] proof of reserves. Uh maybe that's what
[70:21] the market might want.
[70:23] But the absolutely a lot of regulatory
[70:27] votes you got to get through.
[70:29] There's a lot going on. Um the the time
[70:32] completely flew by today. I loved the
[70:35] topics that we have covered today. Um I
[70:37] have one question that I ask each and
[70:38] every one of my guests and the question
[70:40] is what can we learn from you besides
[70:43] Bitcoin? What can you learn from me
[70:44] besides
[70:46] Bitcoin?
[70:48] Um I guess we talked a little bit about
[70:50] just you know I'm I'm a big um hard work
[70:54] and smart smart work maxi as well.
[70:58] So, um, the proof of work that comes
[71:01] from Bitcoin,
[71:02] uh, it should also match your proof of
[71:04] work in your daily life. So, make sure
[71:07] you're getting to work, you're making
[71:09] things happen in your daily life, and,
[71:11] um, as you do that, you'll you'll start
[71:14] to be able to stack a lot more Bitcoin
[71:16] than maybe you ever thought was
[71:18] possible. I like that. It's like in
[71:21] invest in yourself, as as we said
[71:23] before, like invest in yourself in in
[71:25] your family and in in Bitcoin. That's
[71:27] that's the three topics, the the three
[71:29] things where where most of your money
[71:31] should go. Um, really cool. Thank you so
[71:33] much. Um, we have an entine in the
[71:34] podcast where the previous guest is
[71:36] asking a question for the next guest
[71:37] without knowing who the next guest
[71:38] actually is. And the previous guest
[71:40] asked you the question, what are you
[71:42] doing in your local economy to further
[71:44] the adoption of Bitcoin?
[71:49] Okay. Um, right now in my local economy,
[71:54] um, you know, I'm not really going to
[71:56] businesses with uh with it. I do I do
[72:01] talk to I mean, I just kind of everyone
[72:03] knows that I'm that that that the
[72:04] Bitcoiner guy, right? Everyone I talk to
[72:07] and um I'm not doing a ton right now. I
[72:10] wish I was doing more. Um, but u I've
[72:14] just noticed that people kind of go at
[72:15] their own pace. So, um, I have had, you
[72:19] know, one of my cousins just recently
[72:21] texted me and said, "Hey, I'm starting
[72:22] to buy $100 of Bitcoin every other week,
[72:26] you know, every paycheck." And so, that
[72:28] was kind of cool to see. Um, that's been
[72:31] like years to get them to start doing
[72:33] that. But, um, you know, just helping
[72:36] people out. If they need help with
[72:38] Bitcoin, they know I'm available. Um, I
[72:41] try to just give them some ideas. You
[72:43] know, I did a we did a white elephant
[72:44] gift. um at my company party uh over
[72:49] Christmas and I you know I I gave like a
[72:52] cold card and uh a seed seed plate and
[72:55] different things. So just trying to get
[72:58] people's ideas open to how they can own
[73:00] their own money. So I'm not doing a ton.
[73:02] I wish I was doing more, but uh just
[73:05] slowly slowly spreading the word of
[73:07] Bitcoin little by little is is what I'm
[73:09] doing. I love that. Thank you so much um
[73:11] Sean for being on. Um this was really
[73:14] awesome. Before I let you go, where can
[73:16] people find you, ask a question, reach
[73:17] out to you? Yeah, you can find me on
[73:20] Twitter at big Sean Harris. Um, and then
[73:24] every four years we run the having
[73:26] party. So I am uh the organizer, one of
[73:28] the organizers for the having party.

[73:32] eyes, laser eye meme from the meme
[73:34] factory. We're the ones who started that
[73:36] and then we started the having party
[73:38] back in 2024. And so 2028 we will be
[73:42] having the next having party. So come

[73:50] we're choosing the location now. So
[73:52] we're excited for for every having party
[73:55] and um it's not a typical Bitcoin
[73:58] conference. It's more of a celebration
[74:00] of the monetary policy. What makes
[74:03] Bitcoin special? What what what better
[74:05] location to celebrate uh the Bitcoin
[74:08] policies, the monetary policy than in
[74:10] the home of Austrian economics? I I'm a
[74:12] big fan of Vienna. Just so if you need a
[74:15] location, like hit me up.
[74:18] I don't think there's any beaches in
[74:19] Vienna. That's the only thing.
[74:23] Uh great lakes. Really really great
[74:25] lakes. Uh that almost as big as as in
[74:29] there as an ocean. But yeah, like lakes
[74:33] the Austria has everything except the
[74:36] ocean and good policies. But yeah. Yeah.
[74:40] Yeah, that's true. But yeah, uh thank
[74:41] you so much for for for coming on. Um it
[74:45] was a really pleasure and it was really
[74:47] really cool uh to talk about the
[74:49] borrowing against Bitcoin and and the
[74:51] philosophy of of selling Bitcoin with
[74:54] the OG topics. I loved it a lot. Um
