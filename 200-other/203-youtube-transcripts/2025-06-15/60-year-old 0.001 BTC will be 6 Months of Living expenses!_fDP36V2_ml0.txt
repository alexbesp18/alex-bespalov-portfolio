[00:00] I do think Bitcoin is going into the the
[00:02] millions and and tens of millions of
[00:03] dollars over the next 20 or 30 years
[00:06] we're about
[00:07] 6.7% adoption rate globally with Bitcoin
[00:10] technology which put us in 1993 with the
[00:12] Telecom business over the next 5 years
[00:14] in the Telecommunications business it
[00:16] grew from about a 7% Global penetration
[00:18] to around 30% in 5 years and in 10 years
[00:22] the adoption grew up to 60% Bitcoin
[00:24] seems to be growing at a faster adoption
[00:26] rate than that so within 60 months we're
[00:29] probably going to be put pushing
[00:30] somewhere around a 35 to 40% adoption
[00:32] rate 100,000 satosi buy you in the
[00:34] future is 20 30 years from now is 6
[00:36] months worth of living expenses this
[00:38] stuff here is the true weapon of mass
[00:40] destruction in the world the price of
[00:42] Bitcoin is going to have to go through
[00:43] the roof I do think that going forward
[00:45] that the stock market will eventually
[00:47] get some of its value sucked out of it
[00:49] because we won't need to go there we
[00:50] won't need to gamble so much with our
[00:51] money when our money itself has a store
[00:53] of value built into it the idea of
[00:55] Bitcoin the idea of sound money the idea
[00:57] of digital scarcity that's now planted
[01:00] in all our heads and it will never go
[01:03] away most people in the United States do
[01:04] not have a financial education what our
[01:06] government has done is they become a
[01:08] master at using this technology to blur
[01:11] the information to steal your
[01:13] [Music]
[01:16] energy I want to really start uh the day
[01:19] in with with your background because
[01:21] it's really interesting you are 60 years
[01:23] old and you have a long background in
[01:25] telecommunications so I was like that's
[01:27] a it's a perfect way of seeing the
[01:30] global adoption or comparing the global
[01:32] adoption from telec Communications with
[01:35] that from Bitcoin um what did you learn
[01:38] from the global adoption that you saw
[01:40] over the last yeah 50 years um from that
[01:44] internet adoption telecommunication
[01:46] adoption uh what can you what can we
[01:49] learn from that from that and how does
[01:52] this apply to to bitcoin sure uh yeah I
[01:56] see a lot of parallels in the technology
[01:59] I mean you know the cell phone industry
[02:01] was our biggest part of our te
[02:02] telecommunications business um and the
[02:06] adoption of it changed the world I mean
[02:08] cell phones have changed the world and I
[02:10] think you know it's it's a it's a
[02:12] powerful technology that's still
[02:14] changing the world
[02:15] today the uh the Telecommunications
[02:18] business um I started in in in
[02:22] 1993 and at the time I got into the
[02:25] business we had about globally speaking
[02:28] we had about uh a 7% Market uh market
[02:33] adoption uh globally speaking
[02:35] penetration you might say
[02:37] so it uh it was a good it was a good 10
[02:40] years from from 20 thou from 1993 to
[02:42] 2003 were my Glory Days in my in my life
[02:45] they were my biggest years my biggest
[02:46] earning years and it was it was the
[02:48] biggest explosion in the industry as far
[02:51] as adoption went and I and I think right
[02:53] now if we look at where Bitcoin is and
[02:56] these Technologies blockchain
[02:57] cryptocurrency Technologies we're we're
[02:59] at that same inflection point we're
[03:01] we're at a 1993 moment um I even looked
[03:05] it up and it looks like we're about
[03:07] 6.7% uh adoption rate globally with it
[03:10] with Bitcoin technology if the numbers
[03:12] are right uh so if that's if that's
[03:15] accurate we're right about the same 7%
[03:19] which put us in 1993 with the Telecom
[03:22] business so over the next uh over the
[03:25] next five years in the
[03:26] Telecommunications uh business it grew
[03:29] from about a 7% uh Global uh penetration
[03:33] to around 30% in 5 years and in 10 years
[03:38] it it actually it actually grew it
[03:41] actually grew actually uh fast
[03:44] forwarding to to 15 years so if we go
[03:47] from 2003 to 2008 the adoption grew up
[03:51] to 60% now now Bitcoin seems to be
[03:54] growing at a faster adoption rate than
[03:56] that so so I think that if we're at 7%
[03:59] now Within months you know we're we're
[04:01] going to we're going to be we're
[04:03] probably going to be pushing somewhere
[04:04] around a 35 to 40% adoption rate with
[04:07] cryptocurrency and Bitcoin blockchain
[04:10] Technologies over the next 10 years it's
[04:12] going to be a fascinating ride it's
[04:13] going to get really fun the the first 10
[04:16] years in the Telecommunications business
[04:18] like I said were my Glory Days it was
[04:20] fun I mean yeah it was the money was was
[04:23] coming in I was having fun and I see
[04:26] that and I feel that same feeling that I
[04:28] did in 1993 Robin where I feel this is
[04:31] about to to go mainstream and if it does
[04:35] anything like the Telecommunications
[04:36] business did over the next 10 years just
[04:38] over the next 10 years it's going to be
[04:40] life-changing for so many people the if
[04:43] they just if they can just have a a five
[04:45] to 10 year time frame and and not this
[04:49] get-rich quick mentality that a lot of
[04:51] people have they can just be a little
[04:53] bit patient and if I can be patient at
[04:55] 60 um I think they can be patient now I
[04:58] did get in in 20 17 so I've already seen
[05:01] some pretty good returns and pretty good
[05:03] gains with this technology but I went
[05:06] down the rabbit hole very quickly I I
[05:08] seen it just like I did the
[05:09] Telecommunications business when I got
[05:11] in I seen the potential of what this
[05:13] technology was going to do and in the
[05:16] Telecommunications business
[05:18] unfortunately there was so much heavy
[05:19] lifting you had to really risk things
[05:22] like leases and you know a lot of
[05:24] expenses and jeopardized bankruptcy to
[05:26] get into that industry with with Bitcoin
[05:29] there's not so much heavy lifting so you
[05:30] don't have to really you know uh risk
[05:33] bankruptcy to to get into Bitcoin you
[05:36] just got to have a a a little bit of
[05:38] money and start putting it in over time
[05:40] so I think the adoption rate is way
[05:42] ahead of where Bitcoin is and it's going
[05:44] to continue to grow uh imagine if 10
[05:48] years from now we're we're at a 60%
[05:51] adoption rate what's that going to look
[05:52] like uh with the with the price of
[05:55] Bitcoin it it it with with a finite
[05:58] asset like this
[06:00] it's hard to imagine where the price of
[06:03] Bitcoin is going to be over the next 5
[06:04] to 10 years I'm going to be on that
[06:06] train you can't get me off I'm going to
[06:09] be riding that train and if I do need
[06:11] some money I'll be trying to leverage it
[06:13] instead of selling it you know try to
[06:14] borrow against it um there's some great
[06:17] areas to put it into like the Roth IRA
[06:19] like your last um Mark was talking about
[06:22] it's a great place to to to to build up
[06:24] a Roth IRA with it and so if you if
[06:26] you've got the time uh you know I I just
[06:29] started a Roth IR area a couple years
[06:31] ago if I can do it at my age then a lot
[06:33] of your listeners can do it and it's
[06:34] already growing like mad uh so you know
[06:38] start making a plan because um I can
[06:41] tell you with the adoption of the telom
[06:43] business this is following a a similar
[06:45] path and this is going to be explosive I
[06:49] don't think people are ready for what's
[06:50] about to happen but um I I'm ready so um
[06:54] hopefully that gives you a little bit of
[06:55] insight on that really really cool thank
[06:57] you um you also said like
[07:00] that uh currently Bitcoin is growing
[07:02] faster do you expect that to continue
[07:04] that Bitcoin will grow faster also in
[07:06] the future and if so why why do you
[07:09] think that Bitcoin grows faster is is it
[07:11] because we already have
[07:13] telecommunications well yeah obviously
[07:16] that we couldn't do it without the
[07:17] Telecom business right we we you know we
[07:20] need the Internet we need cell phones we
[07:21] we need all this stuff to make this
[07:23] happen and and all those all all that
[07:25] platform is already in place so I think
[07:28] that's one of the reasons why this
[07:29] adoption which is being built on top of
[07:31] that adoption is going to grow so much
[07:34] faster because we don't have to build
[07:35] the infrastructure like we did in the
[07:37] early days with the Telecom business we
[07:38] had to build the infrastructure back
[07:40] then and now we don't it's already in
[07:42] place so we can adopt this technology
[07:44] much quicker uh and and and why do I
[07:47] think it's going to happen why do I
[07:48] think I believe in it so certain is that
[07:51] who doesn't want better money I mean if
[07:54] somebody says they don't want Bitcoin
[07:56] they just don't understand it because I
[07:58] think everybody on planet wants better
[08:00] money and I know I do I want money that
[08:03] gains purchasing power over time instead
[08:05] of loses purchasing power over time and
[08:07] when you're ready to talk about a little
[08:08] inflation boy I'm going to give you an
[08:10] earful yeah inflation is a good you you
[08:13] said something before we talked uh
[08:15] before we recorded something really uh
[08:17] interesting you don't have you you don't
[08:19] fear the man in the gun uh you the man
[08:23] in the gun you fear uh the man with the
[08:26] money printer like why why that
[08:30] you know growing up as a kid um you know
[08:33] I lived in California my whole life uh
[08:36] we were as I look back on my childhood
[08:39] you know and it was actually much better
[08:41] back then far better than it is now far
[08:43] safer um we don't see all the social
[08:45] Decay that we see now in the streets but
[08:48] you know the only thing I feared back
[08:50] then was a bad person right you know
[08:52] someone who was going to rob me maybe
[08:53] steal my wallet uh you know a little bit
[08:55] of money that I had in there and uh so I
[08:58] always feared the man with the you know
[09:00] was going to rob me um and or I say the
[09:03] man with a gun right uh and now I don't
[09:06] fear the man with a gun anymore I I I
[09:08] fear the man with the money printer
[09:09] because you know the the man the man
[09:11] that robs you pretty much he's you know
[09:13] he's going to steal your wallet you know
[09:14] that's about all he can get but the man
[09:16] with the money printer can steal your
[09:17] dreams and you know that's a that's a
[09:21] serious price to pay and so as I'm
[09:24] retired and I'm trying to enjoy my life
[09:27] and Safeguard my future against the you
[09:30] know economic theft out there I'm not
[09:32] worried about that man anymore you know
[09:34] on the street that's not my biggest fear
[09:37] it's it's the man with the money printer
[09:39] hope that explains it and you orange
[09:41] yeah you you said also that you uh lot
[09:44] boots on the ground you're trying the
[09:45] orange pill a lot uh in person um I'm
[09:49] always really surprised by people not
[09:53] getting the inflation the problem of it
[09:55] like if if they maybe need a little
[09:57] longer of time for getting the solution
[10:00] like getting Bitcoin and what they can
[10:01] do with it um okay that's fair but why
[10:05] do you think that people have a hard
[10:07] time getting out of the Euro getting out
[10:10] of the dollar getting out of that fear
[10:12] inflation it seems so obvious that it's
[10:15] bad right well you know that's a good
[10:17] point and I and and this is one of my
[10:19] favorite topics to talk about uh I love
[10:23] to talk inflation you know the one of
[10:27] the things I think that's slowing some
[10:28] of the younger generation down Robin is
[10:30] they haven't seen the inflation that
[10:32] somebody my age has seen just like I
[10:34] haven't seen the inflation that you know
[10:36] somebody 20 or 30 years has seen uh you
[10:39] know that are that's older than me so it
[10:42] it's they just haven't seen it yet I'll
[10:44] give you an example um I have it I have
[10:47] some I have some I have something very
[10:49] dirty I have to show you here it's so
[10:51] dirty I don't know if you can show it on
[10:52] your podcast but it's dirty
[10:55] Fiat okay so so here here's how couple
[10:59] old dirty Fiat bills I should have put
[11:01] gloves on probably before I handle this
[11:03] stuff it's I don't even like to touch it
[11:05] anymore but these are some really old
[11:08] bills from 19 uh one of them dated 1934
[11:11] the other's uh dated
[11:14] 1928 and the reason I have two of them
[11:17] here is because I try to uh look in my
[11:21] own life at the inflation that I've seen
[11:23] because that's all I can compare is what
[11:25] I've seen since I've been a kid growing
[11:27] up and um when in 1974 I was 10 years
[11:30] old Robin uh and back then the minimum
[11:34] wage was $2 $2 an hour so imagine that I
[11:40] you had to work as a as an adult you had
[11:42] to work uh you know an hour to earn two
[11:45] of these but the purchasing power of
[11:48] these was quite different back then and
[11:50] I like to explain things in a simple way
[11:52] for people to understand and give them
[11:53] something to visualize when I talk about
[11:55] inflation because I don't think it's a
[11:58] it's a hard thing for a lot of people
[11:59] people to visualize they just go into
[12:00] the grocery store they go buy something
[12:02] and they know the price went up but a
[12:04] lot of people don't think much further
[12:06] than that they just know something's
[12:08] wrong but they they don't they don't
[12:09] have a lot to reflect on and and being
[12:12] 60 I have more to reflect on than
[12:13] somebody at the age of 30 or my son I
[12:15] have a 38 38y old son and um he can't
[12:20] reflect on it as much as I can so I'm
[12:21] constantly talking to him about it by
[12:23] the way he's a bitcoiner as well I
[12:25] orange pilled him he was one of my first
[12:27] orange pills anyway uh
[12:29] the the story that I'm trying to get to
[12:31] here is in in 1974 I I would go in and
[12:35] buy an ice cream at at the uh we had
[12:37] this place called thrify ice cream I'm
[12:38] sure a lot of people in America that are
[12:41] listening to this understand what I'm
[12:42] talking about as far as thrifties ice
[12:44] cream and to give you an example I could
[12:47] have walked into Thrifty's Ice Cream
[12:49] when I was a kid imagine this this is
[12:51] this is
[12:52] shocking I could have walked into
[12:54] Thrifty's Ice Cream when I was a kid and
[12:55] with one of these bills just a $1 bill
[12:58] Robin in
[13:00] 1974 I could have treated 20 of my
[13:04] friends to a single scoop of ice cream
[13:06] with a cone so imagine a line 20 people
[13:10] now this was 5 cents a scoop with a cone
[13:13] imagine 20 people I could have treated
[13:15] my EV actually it's ironic I could have
[13:18] treated every kid in my neighborhood
[13:20] literally we had about 20 kids on the
[13:22] street I could have treated every single
[13:24] one of them to an ice cream went down
[13:25] and been the big man on the Block and
[13:27] with $1 I could have bought them all an
[13:28] ice cream
[13:29] that's absolutely amazing now to give
[13:32] you an idea how things have changed um
[13:35] about a month ago my better half which
[13:38] is Margaret uh her and I went down to my
[13:41] old stomping grounds and the building
[13:45] was still there it was not no longer a
[13:46] thrifties it was a r Aid apparently R A
[13:49] had had bought out thrifties ice cream
[13:51] or bought bought thrifties out and the
[13:52] ice cream uh with it so when I went into
[13:56] the store we we walked in there I looked
[13:58] to the left and I didn't expect to see
[14:00] what I what I seen I actually seen the
[14:02] same ice cream stand from 50 years ago
[14:05] that I used to buy ice cream at it was
[14:07] still standing and it still said Thrifty
[14:09] Ice Cream even though it was no longer a
[14:10] thrifty store so I went over to it there
[14:13] was a guy buying an ice cream is
[14:15] standing in line there and I looked at
[14:16] the prices well a scoop now with a cone
[14:21] is two bucks $1.99 but we'll round it
[14:23] off to $2 I think it's close enough so
[14:27] now with this $2 I can't I can buy one I
[14:32] can buy myself uh you know an ice cream
[14:35] and a cone but but but my 19 friends
[14:37] they don't get one any longer now if you
[14:40] want to take into consideration
[14:41] obviously wage growth right so I did the
[14:44] math on it and I said okay well what
[14:46] what is the minimum wage today and out
[14:48] here it's about $16 an hour so you can
[14:51] earn 16 of these now instead of two so
[14:54] that means that even with the wage
[14:55] growth I can only buy eight people a
[14:59] cone and an ice cream for an hour is
[15:00] worth of my economic energy
[15:03] so imagine imagine I could have bought
[15:06] 20 people a a cone and an ice cream or
[15:09] actually no I take that back with $2 if
[15:12] I worked an hour I could have bought 40
[15:15] people for one hour is worth of my
[15:17] economic energy 40 people imagine that
[15:20] line going out the ice cream shop right
[15:22] 40 I got 40 people here I want to buy a
[15:24] scoop of ice cream and a cone with uh
[15:26] for $2 now I can only buy eight so that
[15:29] gives you an idea that you know and I
[15:31] know it's just we're talking ice cream
[15:33] here and that may sound kind of you know
[15:36] kind of ridiculous but this just doesn't
[15:39] work with ice cream this works with
[15:40] everything and and I'll give you another
[15:43] example of the first time and that was
[15:45] actually the first time I saw inflation
[15:46] is is in 1974 when I watched a a scoop
[15:50] of ice cream go from 5 cents to 10 cents
[15:53] that that was my first uh running and
[15:55] bout with inflation is the prices of the
[15:57] ice cream went up so as a kid that was
[15:59] like wow what happened you know walked
[16:01] into the store and all of a sudden the
[16:02] price went up on the ice cream you know
[16:03] and everybody was talking about it we
[16:05] didn't know what it was it was my you
[16:07] know since since Nixon took us off the
[16:08] gold standard in
[16:10] 71 um it took a few years before it it
[16:12] kind of kicked in and uh the first place
[16:15] that showed up for me was in the was in
[16:16] the ice cream stand as a kid so you know
[16:19] I I thought that would be something to
[16:20] share with your your listeners also
[16:23] another interesting fact of inflation in
[16:25] my life that I've seen is uh we were
[16:28] driving around my old old neighborhood
[16:29] that I grew up in and and I had a
[16:31] neighborhood Robin that had 20 homes on
[16:33] each side of the
[16:35] street uh and in 1974 those homes were
[16:40] $25,000 a piece so for a million dollars
[16:44] Robin you could have bought the entire
[16:45] neighborhood imagine that a million
[16:47] dollars you could have bought all 40
[16:48] homes in the neighborhood for a million
[16:50] dollars in 1974 now we drove around that
[16:54] neighborhood and the neighborhood didn't
[16:57] get better the neighbor neighbor Hood
[16:59] the neighborhood got awful I mean it
[17:02] it's so much worse than I liveed there
[17:05] than when I lived there and it was sad
[17:07] to see the the the the decay of my
[17:09] neighborhood it was close to LA area um
[17:13] but I I looked at one of my friends in
[17:16] high school I looked at at his parents
[17:19] home that was for sale uh and and the
[17:21] the father still lived there and it was
[17:24] up for sale so we decided to get out of
[17:25] the car and walk in and look at the home
[17:27] and I grabbed a flyer on it and so
[17:30] imagine 1974
[17:32] $25,000 per home now the asking price
[17:35] was $695,000 for that same home so for a
[17:39] million dollars you could buy like one
[17:41] you know 1.3 homes now instead of
[17:44] 40 you know wages just aren't keeping up
[17:47] so again how do we protect ourselves
[17:49] from this this debasement and this
[17:50] economic theft of our of our of our
[17:53] currency um and I think Bitcoin is the
[17:55] best thing I've ever found now it's not
[17:57] the only thing that I invest in I
[17:58] believe in a little bit more of
[18:00] diversification you know I like I like a
[18:02] three-legged stool approach uh you know
[18:05] so I I I also like real estate and I
[18:07] also like some stocks but Bitcoin uh is
[18:12] a very uh large portion of of that um
[18:15] that plan that's such an interesting uh
[18:18] comparison because when you talk of like
[18:21] okay you could have feeded 40 people uh
[18:25] and then uh uh later you can only feed
[18:29] eight people that's a 5x like that's
[18:32] that's 5x more expensive uh than before
[18:36] and this doesn't take into account that
[18:39] actually technology is getting better
[18:41] over time so things should actually be
[18:43] deflationary like should not even go up
[18:46] so that's a major thing I mean I don't
[18:48] know how much fast and better we can get
[18:50] in in producing ice cream because
[18:52] producing ice cream I have no clue how
[18:55] to produce ice cream actually but I I
[18:57] guess the the the the the bare method is
[19:00] not as changing maybe we could even make
[19:03] an argument that the ice cream we get
[19:05] now is a little bit more unhealthy than
[19:08] we we got it a few a few decades ago uh
[19:12] but I I'm not an ice cream expert so I
[19:14] cannot really make that argument but I I
[19:16] could imagine that it's actually like
[19:18] that um but then when we think about the
[19:22] the importance of sound money then
[19:25] because when you compare like okay how
[19:27] many ice creams you you can get but you
[19:29] cannot really store the ice creams but
[19:31] maybe you can bought have bit uh you
[19:33] could have bought gold with that or
[19:35] really good stock or whatever that holds
[19:38] the inflation a little bit better and
[19:40] keeps up with it um and then when we
[19:42] think of the current state right now
[19:44] with Bitcoin uh and where inflation I
[19:47] think is really starting in in the next
[19:50] in the next few decades because money
[19:53] print the more money you print the more
[19:55] money you have to print the more money
[19:56] you print you have the more money you
[19:59] then also have to print so like it's a
[20:01] virtual cycle um what will the
[20:04] importance be of like let's say a
[20:06] 100,000
[20:08] satosi uh now is not a lot of money but
[20:12] uh what will that be what what do you
[20:15] think will 100,000 Sates represent when
[20:19] we look out uh 20 years from now or 30
[20:22] years from now uh when we are at this 60
[20:25] 70 uh% of of adoption rate what you
[20:28] talked before about um that like what do
[20:32] you do you have a framework to to think
[20:33] about the the the purchasing power not
[20:36] the not I I try to not focus on the on
[20:39] the US dollar equivalent I try to focus
[20:41] on like what the importance of H 100,000
[20:45] Sates could be in like 20 years well
[20:49] that's yeah that that's a you know
[20:52] that's anybody's guess but but if I had
[20:54] if I had to guess based on where I think
[20:55] bitcoin's going and and I I do think
[20:58] Bitcoin Co is going into the the
[20:59] millions and and tens of millions of
[21:01] dollars over the next 20 or 30 years um
[21:05] so you know dividing that by a you know
[21:07] by 100,000 Satoshi you know I would I
[21:10] would think you know the worst case that
[21:12] 100,000 Satoshi would would buy you in
[21:15] the future I I is is May you know the
[21:18] worst case I I would say 100,000 satosi
[21:21] would buy you in the future is 20 30
[21:22] years from now is maybe 6 months worth
[21:24] of living expenses um you know whatever
[21:26] that is or 6 months worth of inome come
[21:29] at that time I think the best case is
[21:32] you know a 100,000 Satoshi uh could
[21:36] could could possibly buy you you know in
[21:38] 20 or 30 years you know maybe a new car
[21:40] a new vehicle um I think it's going to
[21:43] take a little bit more than that to buy
[21:44] you a house uh however I do think more
[21:47] like a million Satoshi could could
[21:49] possibly end up buying you you know uh
[21:51] putting shelter over your head or maybe
[21:53] even buying you buying you uh you know
[21:56] maybe a flat or or an apartment style uh
[21:59] life um I I don't know if you're going
[22:01] to be able to get a mansion in a yacht
[22:02] for for a million Satoshi over the next
[22:04] 20 or 30 years extrapolated out further
[22:07] than that possibly uh myself I'm I'm
[22:09] kind of looking at the next maybe 25
[22:11] years or you know maybe 26 years if
[22:14] average man lives to 86 for me I'm kind
[22:16] of thinking what's this going to do for
[22:17] me over the next you know 25 to to 30
[22:20] years and I think whatever it does it's
[22:23] it's going to definitely secure my
[22:25] future it it's going to give me the the
[22:27] economic uh Freedom that I need to make
[22:30] sure that I'm okay in the future and you
[22:33] know as you get older you're you're you
[22:36] be your wants and your needs change
[22:38] Robin and you know when I was younger
[22:41] yeah I wanted the fancy cars and the big
[22:43] houses and that was really important to
[22:44] me as I've gotten older I've become more
[22:46] of a minimalist um yeah I've kept some
[22:49] of the things you know back in the
[22:50] Heyday that that I spent money on uh
[22:53] some of my favorite uh possessions but
[22:55] as I've gotten older I really feel that
[22:57] less is more
[22:59] and you know I don't need big houses and
[23:01] fancy cars and all this stuff I I drive
[23:03] an old Toyota Corolla that that you know
[23:08] it doesn't look so well you know but
[23:10] it's a great car right I look for Value
[23:12] um and I actually feel safe in that
[23:14] that's so that's so weird because um I
[23:17] actually feel safer you know driving
[23:19] that around than I would now in
[23:21] California driving around an expensive
[23:23] car wearing a Rolex watch or anything
[23:24] like that because um you know I I I
[23:27] don't feel that's something that we
[23:28] should be doing any longer is is
[23:30] flashing wealth like that um so I think
[23:33] I think it's the the future of of this
[23:35] is you know if you got 100,000 Satoshi a
[23:37] million Satoshi of Bitcoin in the future
[23:39] I think it's going to turn into
[23:40] something that's worth a lot and maybe
[23:42] you just kind of sh you know you mums
[23:44] the word and you just kind of walk
[23:46] softly you know and and and be quiet
[23:49] about it because um I don't think things
[23:52] are going to be getting any better
[23:53] anytime soon and I think there's going
[23:55] to be a hard A Hard Knock on people's
[23:57] head that that are are asleep behind the
[23:59] wheel right now that aren't paying
[24:00] attention to what's going on with the
[24:02] inflation and and everything and a lot
[24:04] of people have social security or they
[24:05] have a pension coming in and I find
[24:07] those people to be a lot of times the
[24:09] people that are hardest to orange pill
[24:11] because they've already got their their
[24:13] retirement set oh I've got my pension
[24:14] I've got my Social Security coming in
[24:16] you know and and you know they've got
[24:18] their little life going and they've got
[24:19] everything going and that's good for
[24:21] them I hope that stays going for them
[24:23] but I think a lot of those people are
[24:25] going to wake up one morning and realize
[24:26] that that social security check doesn't
[24:28] buy much more than a loaf of bread uh at
[24:31] one point and um the money printer is
[24:34] not going to stop that's one thing I'm
[24:35] certain of is that they're not they're
[24:37] not going to default and they're going
[24:38] to keep that money printer going so the
[24:40] inflation is going to continue to get
[24:41] worse which means satoshis are going to
[24:43] continue to go up I've got a I've got
[24:45] something neat that I got for my
[24:47] birthday when I turned 60 Margaret
[24:48] bought me a block clock I don't know if
[24:50] you know what a block clock is but
[24:52] they're really cool and I don't have
[24:54] much of a need for stuff like that and I
[24:57] was you know I was really even shameful
[24:59] for asking for it you know when I turn I
[25:02] said she said what can I get you when
[25:03] you turn 60 and I said you know the only
[25:05] thing that I really would kind of like
[25:07] as a block block and I'll tell you what
[25:08] that was actually a good investment
[25:10] because what that did for me talking
[25:12] about Satoshi Robin is that allows me to
[25:15] display the constant value of Satoshi um
[25:18] versus dollar so it breaks it down for
[25:20] me so as I'm sitting there drinking my
[25:22] coffee in the morning I can look at how
[25:23] many Satoshi I can buy for a dollar and
[25:25] for me that's become more valuable to me
[25:28] I actually find myself smash buying
[25:29] Bitcoin based on that more than the
[25:31] price because I see that Satoshi are
[25:33] getting are getting more expensive over
[25:35] time when when I got the clock back in
[25:37] January you could get 2500 Satoshi for a
[25:41] dollar now it's it even with all this
[25:43] volatility you know it's like, 1650
[25:45] satoshis per dollar right now um so over
[25:48] time it's you know these satoshis are
[25:50] just going to get more expensive so even
[25:52] if you don't have a lot of money to
[25:53] throw at this just just start buying
[25:55] some Satoshi whatever whatever that can
[25:57] be you know I mean I don't care if it's
[25:59] only $10 a week get some Satoshi uh you
[26:02] know and start saving those things um
[26:05] because they're going to get they're
[26:06] definitely going to going to go up in
[26:07] value versus the the Fiat um currency
[26:10] that I showed you personally Robin I
[26:13] think this stuff here is the true weapon
[26:16] of mass destruction in the world I I
[26:18] call this a weapon of mass destruction
[26:20] what I've seen this stuff do the social
[26:22] moral ethical and cultural decay of our
[26:24] society is is in I believe caused by
[26:27] this during fiat currency it is dirty I
[26:30] mean it literally I don't even like to
[26:32] touch it there's nothing good about this
[26:34] nothing at all this is from the start to
[26:37] the finish this stuff is dirty and we've
[26:39] got to get people realizing that this
[26:42] isn't good I know a lot of people think
[26:44] the more of this they have the better
[26:46] but no really not we don't want this
[26:49] stuff we don't want to save in this
[26:50] stuff we have a better instrument now we
[26:52] have a better money and this isn't
[26:54] really money anyway it's a money
[26:55] substitute you know it's a fiat currency
[26:58] so don't save your economic energy and
[27:00] this where can be stolen in De base do
[27:03] you see the chance that that feed
[27:05] actually goes away completely in in for
[27:08] example my lifetime I'm 25 so let's say
[27:11] I'm living to 100 so the next 75
[27:14] years absolutely yeah I you know my
[27:17] predictions on on this stuff and and you
[27:20] know I've done okay in life I mean I'm
[27:23] not you know I'm not I'm not a financial
[27:25] genius or anything like that but I
[27:27] certainly was was able to to to take an
[27:29] early retirement at 49 and it was
[27:31] self-made retirement where I don't get
[27:33] that pension you know I had to build my
[27:35] own retirement which is which I wouldn't
[27:37] change for the world because being
[27:38] self-employed gives you a lot of freedom
[27:40] and I like and I always like that
[27:41] freedom I could never go back to work
[27:42] for anybody uh ever again even if I was
[27:46] out of money today I wouldn't go back to
[27:48] work for somebody I would you know I
[27:50] would I would start up something uh but
[27:53] um to answer your question I think the
[27:56] dollar days are numbered I think by
[27:58] you know maybe as close as by the end of
[28:01] this decade uh we lose the global
[28:03] Reserve currency status as people are
[28:05] running for the exits from this stuff
[28:08] and and I think by 2035 we have a pretty
[28:11] much total collapse of the dollar in
[28:13] purchasing power you know we've only got
[28:15] a few percent left of it in spending
[28:17] power and I think that it's slow you
[28:19] know we lose it slowly over time and
[28:22] that was the miracle behind this
[28:23] instrument of theft um and that's how
[28:25] they could hide it for so long but they
[28:26] can't hide it anymore so I think what's
[28:28] happening is it it you know it's the
[28:30] dollar is stable on the way down and
[28:31] it's been that way since they took it
[28:33] off the gold standard and I think what's
[28:34] going to happen at the end it's going to
[28:36] fall off a cliff and you're you're going
[28:38] to wake up to a massive debasement of
[28:39] the currency overnight now it could
[28:41] stick around but I don't think people
[28:44] are are going to want to be using it
[28:45] anymore uh you know at that point um
[28:47] we've seen currencies hyperinflate
[28:49] before that are still around for some
[28:50] reason right um but at the end of the
[28:52] day I think the dollar the the the
[28:55] dollar has caused so much destruction in
[28:56] the world and people are trying to run
[28:58] run from it and protect thems from it
[29:00] that it's um it's on its way out I I
[29:03] love I love uh Brent Johnson I I don't
[29:06] know if you're familiar with Brent
[29:07] Johnson and the dollar milkshake theory
[29:09] that he he released to the world in 2010
[29:12] I I love that and I studied the dollar
[29:14] milkshake Theory um I I I think you only
[29:17] got one thing wrong so Brent you're
[29:19] watching this I think you just shouldn't
[29:20] have named it the dollar milkshake
[29:22] Theory because milkshake is a good thing
[29:24] you know and I don't think this stuff
[29:26] should be in any way related to anything
[29:28] good I mean you couldn't even use it a
[29:31] lot of people call it toilet paper but
[29:32] let's be
[29:33] honest you couldn't use it for that you
[29:35] probably get some kind of an infection
[29:37] this is just this is just dirty stuff
[29:40] through and through and and we we really
[29:42] need to get away from it we really need
[29:43] to wake up the world if I had to name
[29:46] his theory I I would rename it to the
[29:48] dollar septic Theory because to me this
[29:52] represents more of something you'd find
[29:54] in a septic tank than in a milkshake um
[29:58] and and my thoughts on that is we see
[30:00] the brics Nations right now they're
[30:01] dollariz we see a lot of countries
[30:03] trying to protect themsel it's not that
[30:06] they that not that they're necessarily I
[30:07] don't think they're necessarily like
[30:09] let's destroy the dollar I think it's
[30:11] just let's protect oursel from this
[30:13] because the dollar we've been exporting
[30:15] our inflation through what I like to
[30:17] call a septic tank system where the
[30:20] United States makes all this stuff in a
[30:22] giant bat vat vat which I call a septic
[30:26] tank and then we we we threw leech
[30:28] we export it to other countries like the
[30:30] dollar milkshake Theory suggests and
[30:33] we're able to continually export our
[30:36] inflation while other countries are
[30:37] tired of it and they're plugging up
[30:39] those leech lines Robin and so what's
[30:41] happening in America now is we're seeing
[30:43] we're seeing the backup of that septic
[30:45] system backing up into our own country
[30:47] we can't hide it anymore and like I said
[30:49] we're seeing the social moral ethical
[30:51] and cultural decay of a great country
[30:54] where look around you're seeing the
[30:56] stench of this stuff backing up into our
[30:58] own country and and it it's just a
[31:00] weapon of mass destruction that that
[31:02] needs to stop it's not going to be
[31:04] pretty when it does a lot of people are
[31:05] going to get hurt that aren't prepared
[31:08] but the only way to fix this is is this
[31:11] stuff has to go away we have to use
[31:12] something better and I think Bitcoin is
[31:14] that tool and I think it is going to be
[31:16] globally adopted and I think that people
[31:18] are going to use it I think countries
[31:20] are going to wake up like Russia and
[31:21] realize that Bitcoin doesn't have to be
[31:23] an enemy these countries don't have to
[31:25] look at it as an enemy it'll work for
[31:27] them it'll work for countries just as
[31:29] well as it works for you and I uh
[31:31] they'll realize that oh my gosh I don't
[31:32] have to trust another Nation I can use
[31:34] this technology for you know for to
[31:37] trade goods and services all around the
[31:39] world and nobody can manipulate this
[31:40] stuff and it's secure so I think when
[31:43] countries wake up and I think they're
[31:45] starting to wake
[31:46] up the the price of Bitcoin is going to
[31:49] have to go through the roof because if
[31:51] you start doing any kind of global trade
[31:52] in this the and because it's a finite
[31:55] Supply the price has to go into the
[31:58] millions of dollars per Bitcoin and that
[32:01] and that's going to be exciting you know
[32:03] uh but I think what's more exciting than
[32:05] the price going up is just the fact that
[32:07] we have something that can help undo the
[32:09] damage that that the Fiat currencies of
[32:12] the world have done to humanity it's
[32:14] going to take some time even with good
[32:16] sound money like Bitcoin to undo this
[32:18] damage Robin because there's a lot of
[32:20] damage that this is a this this is done
[32:23] I mean this is going to take this is
[32:24] going to take decades um you know to fix
[32:27] this kind of dam damage uh that that
[32:29] this has caused if you watch or listen
[32:31] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll
[32:33] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[32:36] and now the most important step is to
[32:39] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[32:42] hardware wallet my personal
[32:43] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[32:45] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[32:48] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:50] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an

[33:46] but not least I have something
[33:47] completely new for you guys I partnered
[33:51] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[33:54] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:57] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:00] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:03] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[34:06] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[34:09] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:11] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[34:15] make sure to check out the link in the
[34:17] description for those amazing coin
[34:19] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[34:22] amazing I love them so much it was
[34:23] really hard for me to pick the one that
[34:26] I want to have because there are lot lot
[34:27] of great options I went with the new
[34:30] transparency Edition they're all limited
[34:33] so grab yours those will not be
[34:36] available for a long time but there will
[34:38] come new models and new amazing designs
[34:41] along the way uh very true I think I
[34:45] think the damaged is is is really bad
[34:47] and and I think we will slowly recover
[34:49] only from that I'm really interested in
[34:51] uh you said like you you for seee like a
[34:54] 20 35 around the total collapse it it
[34:57] can of course as you said like it can
[34:59] stick around a long time um but let's
[35:02] zoom in in that period where the dollar
[35:05] actually collapses um what do you think
[35:09] will Bitcoin do then like do you think
[35:11] that Bitcoin will then already be the
[35:14] obvious alternative or will people
[35:17] search for everything then as right now
[35:19] I mean for example in Turkey we can see
[35:21] it a little bit of course there are a
[35:23] lot of people buying Bitcoin but there
[35:24] also a lot of people buying ETFs buying
[35:27] gold buying everything else uh in order
[35:30] to to save themselves how much sure do
[35:32] you think uh will will Bitcoin be once
[35:35] the world Reserve currency as the dollar
[35:38] is is is collapsing right now now the
[35:41] reason before I answer that question the
[35:43] reason I believe that we will see the
[35:45] End by around 2035 is if you do the math
[35:48] um and you extrapolate out just the bond
[35:51] market alone eventually the bond
[35:54] Market's going to start breaking down it
[35:56] is just they're just isn't going to be
[35:58] enough energy there isn't going to be
[36:00] enough hands out there working to pay
[36:03] the enormous debt and buy the bonds that
[36:06] they need to sell to keep this Ponzi
[36:07] scheme going and and so I think that the
[36:11] end of the dollar is a breakdown of the
[36:12] bond market that's my best guess on this
[36:15] because if we can't sell the bonds to
[36:18] pay the debt or to pay the interest
[36:20] payments if there just isn't enough
[36:22] economic energy out there to buy these
[36:24] bonds it's it's the end of the dollar um
[36:28] uh so you know uh to to to answer your
[36:32] question um I think that um that going
[36:36] forward uh I'm losing my train of
[36:39] thought here again sorry my mind's all
[36:42] over the place run the question by me
[36:44] one more time Robin I do apologize on
[36:46] that no no no worries no worries like I
[36:49] I have this all the time where I'm like
[36:51] oh [ __ ] I'm rambling I'm rambling where
[36:53] where did I wanted to ramble about I was
[36:56] uh I was asking about when we actually
[36:59] collapse the dollar what will Bitcoin be
[37:01] then like how obvious will Bitcoin be as
[37:03] a choice for people uh when when we are
[37:07] collapsing the dollar and you explained
[37:08] like how how why you think it is so so I
[37:12] think I think what it'll be it'll be
[37:14] likely um there'll be enough adoption of
[37:16] Bitcoin by then to where it'll be likely
[37:20] the place that people have immediately
[37:22] to run to so even people that are maybe
[37:24] holding a little bit of Bitcoin when
[37:26] they when they wake up and they see that
[37:28] their dollar lost 40% of its value
[37:30] overnight when we have that final leg
[37:32] down um and we see the hyperinflationary
[37:35] event start starting to take place some
[37:37] might argue it's already happening right
[37:38] look at ice cream uh so so if if we look
[37:42] at that I think it's going to be an
[37:43] there'll be a lot of people having
[37:45] accounts already set up so I think it'll
[37:46] be one of the more obvious places to
[37:48] exit to run for the exit is the Bitcoin
[37:50] exit I think that's likely to happen um
[37:53] and I think that's when we'll see some
[37:54] of those Omega candles and God candles
[37:56] and we're probably going to see some of
[37:57] that before then as well um but I think
[38:00] to that there's also some other areas
[38:02] not just Bitcoin although what I like
[38:04] about Bitcoin of course there's always
[38:05] gold there's always precious metals um
[38:08] however I think that Bitcoin is far
[38:09] superior than that uh and then there's
[38:12] there there's always things like stocks
[38:14] however I do think that going forward
[38:15] that the stock market will eventually
[38:17] get some of its value sucked out of it
[38:19] because we won't need to go there we
[38:21] won't need to gamble so much with our
[38:22] money when our money itself has a store
[38:24] of value built into it you don't have to
[38:26] go outside looking and gamble with your
[38:28] money buying stocks and trying to pick
[38:29] stocks to to gamble that in the future
[38:32] so I think that eventually the stock
[38:33] market's going to get vacuumed into a
[38:35] large portion of it is going to get
[38:36] vacuumed into into Bitcoin as well uh so
[38:39] yeah I think that Bitcoin will be primed
[38:41] in a good position by 2035 to be the
[38:44] main exit for the Fiat currencies of the
[38:47] world um and I think that's where a lot
[38:49] of the money is going to flow very
[38:50] interesting I we talked before uh about
[38:53] this 100,000 of Tores um I get that a
[38:55] lot from beginners like oh how many how
[38:58] many Bitcoin should I accumulate how
[38:59] many satosi should I accumulate do you
[39:01] also get that question and do you have
[39:03] an an answer for that or way to think of
[39:06] like oh yeah like that's like uh if you
[39:09] live in that country you want to have
[39:11] that lifestyle you should at least try
[39:13] to get to that amount of Sates if if you
[39:16] have the means obviously uh the more the
[39:19] better usually but do you have some
[39:21] framework around that well I don't too
[39:23] much get into that discussion but what I
[39:25] do tell people is get off zero you know
[39:28] I I think that's the most important part
[39:30] um you know I don't know if you ever
[39:32] watch this maybe a little off topic here
[39:34] but sometimes I feel like um I feel like
[39:36] Dave you may not know who this actor was
[39:39] the late actor David kerine but we had a
[39:41] great TV show out here uh called Kung Fu
[39:45] and he he used to walk around the desert
[39:47] he walked from town to town with his
[39:48] flute and he was a peaceful guy always
[39:51] always talking to somebody and always
[39:52] trying to do kind things for people but
[39:54] but always fighting the war at the same
[39:56] time he was always fighting battles uh
[39:58] physically with people that didn't
[40:00] understand him and sometimes I feel the
[40:02] same way as him I live in the desert you
[40:05] know and I and I I'm I'm walking around
[40:07] the streets of you know if you want to
[40:09] find me just come down here to Palm
[40:10] Springs look for the guy walking around
[40:11] the downtown with a with a Bitcoin shirt
[40:13] on you know I feel like sometimes I'm
[40:15] him I'm walking around the desert I'm
[40:17] evangelizing this technology to anybody
[40:20] that will listen and sometimes you know
[40:22] that can lead to kind of some some
[40:24] heated debate you know which I try to
[40:26] stay out of where once I see somebody is
[40:29] going negative on me and creating
[40:31] creating an area I don't want to go down
[40:33] I I I try to walk away but I I have some
[40:36] people out here that I walk by that
[40:37] they're sitting out in coffee shops and
[40:39] they they know who I am and you know
[40:41] sometimes they'll say Bitcoin and I
[40:43] notice that they they acknowledge me
[40:44] when the price is going up right uh you
[40:47] know when the price is going down they
[40:48] they they they pretty much don't don't
[40:50] acknowledge me too much but when it's
[40:51] hitting all new all-time highs they'll
[40:53] say something like they'll yell out
[40:54] Bitcoin and I'll say get off zero you
[40:56] know and then if they want to talk if
[40:57] they ask some questions I stop and I
[40:59] talk to them and and I give them some
[41:00] information um so I'm always
[41:02] evangelizing this I'm willing to talk to
[41:04] anybody out here uh in you know to to
[41:07] spread the good word and uh I often feel
[41:10] like that TV character out here you know
[41:12] walking around the desert just uh you
[41:14] know from area to area from from store
[41:16] owner to shop owner you know just just
[41:18] having a good time with it I try to I
[41:20] try to have a good time with it it makes
[41:21] me really happy to talk Bitcoin and I'm
[41:24] willing to talk with anybody about it so
[41:27] um and by the way uh Robin if if um if
[41:31] there are any people out here in the
[41:32] desert that wantan to that want to hook
[41:33] up uh I I joined a Meetup Group out here
[41:37] uh on the Meetup app and uh we have a um
[41:41] a Palm Springs Bitcoin so you can find
[41:44] me there on Palm Springs Bitcoin uh you
[41:47] can join our group we've got uh over 300
[41:49] people in the group right now and uh
[41:52] we'll probably be starting next month uh
[41:55] trying to put on a monthly meeting out
[41:56] here the desert so I encourage anybody
[41:59] that lives close by or wants to
[42:01] communicate uh you know check out the
[42:03] group it's free free to join it's
[42:05] interesting it's like it's it's really
[42:08] important I feel like to meet other
[42:11] bitcoiners in real life like that's
[42:13] something uh we should all strive for as
[42:15] as much as as as possible and and find
[42:18] the local groups go to the conferences
[42:20] if possible go to like small conferences
[42:23] in your area um meetup groups there's
[42:26] orang pill app there a lot of different
[42:28] ways how you can meet
[42:30] bitcoiners uh and it's it's great when
[42:33] when when I see people actually
[42:36] gathering around Bitcoin and actually
[42:38] discussing it in real life I think
[42:40] that's those those connections are so
[42:42] valuable in the future uh that we meet
[42:45] make those now uh that it will be great
[42:49] when you look back in like 20 years not
[42:51] only like oh you got Bitcoin but you
[42:53] also got that Bitcoin uh friend Network
[42:58] where you like have so many great people
[42:59] in one like I think I think it could be
[43:01] very valuable even beyond your stack
[43:04] your stacking the the friends is is is
[43:06] something amazing I'm glad I'm glad you
[43:08] brought that up and I can see it in your
[43:10] face when you're smiling you know
[43:12] Bitcoin just seems to make things better
[43:15] and it is enriched for anybody out there
[43:17] who's sitting on the fence maybe that
[43:19] doesn't own any Bitcoin that maybe is
[43:20] watching this for the first time let me
[43:22] tell you something this for my own
[43:24] personal experience this has enriched my
[43:26] life Robin Bitcoin has enriched my life
[43:29] immensely I I walk around with a Bitcoin
[43:31] shirt on almost every single day
[43:33] wherever I go um I've got a closet full
[43:36] of them and uh you know I I've met I
[43:39] have a couple good friends that I've met
[43:42] out here in the desert because of this
[43:43] shirt which is amaz you know because of
[43:45] wearing Bitcoin shirts um which has
[43:48] enriched my life I mean these are people
[43:51] that um I do stuff with I go places with
[43:54] we we we we don't just talk Bitcoin but
[43:56] it it's it's enriched my life I mean
[43:59] friends are important and when you get
[44:00] on the same wavelength with somebody
[44:02] who's a bitcoiner you're sharing the
[44:05] same passion and it's just a beautiful
[44:07] thing I mean one guy I met a good friend
[44:09] of mine da I met him at at a Vintage
[44:12] Market out here in Palm Springs I was
[44:13] walking around he heard me evangelizing
[44:16] to a to a to an elderly gentleman who
[44:17] asked about it and he stopped you know
[44:20] and he started talking to me about it I
[44:21] heard you talking about Bitcoin and next
[44:23] thing I know we're exchanging numbers
[44:24] we're talking now he's I spend hours
[44:26] every week talking to him on the phone
[44:28] we go places we go to car shows and
[44:30] whatnot together um you know sometimes
[44:33] we get out as a couple together and go
[44:35] out to have dinner so talk about
[44:36] enriching your life um it has really
[44:39] enriched my life and and it's just been
[44:42] one of the side effects of this that I
[44:43] didn't expect when I got into it but
[44:46] it's just beautiful Robin and I could
[44:47] see you have that same that same glow in
[44:49] your face as as I do when it comes to
[44:51] talking about Bitcoin it's it's uh give
[44:54] it a chance out there now in 19 in in uh
[44:58] in uh in 2017 I I I bought my first you
[45:02] know I bought my first Bitcoin I didn't
[45:03] know what it was um unfortunately I I
[45:06] procrastinated before I I I bought it by
[45:08] six months I I watched a documentary by
[45:11] the late um Morgan Spurlock I don't know
[45:14] if you know who he is but he's the guy
[45:15] who created the super siiz me uh
[45:17] documentary about McDonald's and he had
[45:20] created a documentary I seen it on
[45:22] Netflix and I watched it unfortunately
[45:25] his his you know
[45:27] his documentary on bitcoin didn't grab
[45:29] me um it it it it just didn't grab my
[45:33] attention now his super siiz me
[45:35] documentary was great about the the
[45:36] McDonald's and in the fast food industry
[45:39] uh but for some reason it didn't grab me
[45:41] and and and this is a little bit about
[45:42] my journey about getting into Bitcoin uh
[45:45] and and so uh we watched it together
[45:48] Margaret and I and we just kind of
[45:51] shrugged it off and didn't think much
[45:53] about it Bitcoin was about $660 per coin
[45:55] at the time about six months later
[45:58] Margaret asked me to go on to
[46:00] overstock.com and buy her a pair of
[46:03] sunglasses and so I went on there and um
[46:07] when I was checking out it offered me to
[46:09] pay in Bitcoin and it was like getting
[46:12] struck by a lightning bolt I I literally
[46:14] felt like I was moving in slow motion I
[46:16] I couldn't get I couldn't get to Google
[46:18] fast enough to to to Google the price of
[46:21] Bitcoin at that time and it was it was
[46:23] like
[46:23] $2,400 and I thought to myself what is
[46:27] this you know what in the world is this
[46:30] uh and so I said you know what I'm going
[46:31] to punish myself right now I'm GNA
[46:33] blindly just buy this not knowing what
[46:36] it is and and so I I remember I I set up
[46:39] an account and I was pushing the button
[46:41] to buy my first Bitcoin at $2,400 and I
[46:43] thought to myself I deserve to lose this
[46:45] if I lose this I lose this and I deserve
[46:47] to go to the School of Hard Knocks and
[46:49] and lose this so I pushed the button
[46:50] thinking this has gone forever and I'm
[46:52] going to lose this right and that was
[46:54] the beginning of my journey I then uh
[46:56] started learning about it once I had
[46:58] some skin in the game and that's what I
[46:59] I want people to understand out there if
[47:01] you want to learn about Bitcoin get some
[47:03] skin in the game and just start learning
[47:06] about it and I encourage everybody that
[47:07] I speak with don't just listen to me go
[47:10] out and learn about it start watching
[47:12] some YouTube videos learn about it and
[47:16] um I also refer your videos out to
[47:17] people uh and a lot of the the big the
[47:20] big players out there as well and I said
[47:22] just learn about it there's a lot of
[47:24] good information out there you know read
[47:25] the Bitcoin white paper uh put a little
[47:27] skin in the game and just watch this
[47:29] thing uh and for those that I've told
[47:32] that to and I told a lot of people back
[47:34] in
[47:35] 2018 I really didn't start evangelizing
[47:37] till 2018 because I wanted to make sure
[47:40] that I knew as much as I could learn
[47:42] about this technology I went down the
[47:44] rabbit hole very quickly I got more like
[47:46] sucked down the rabbit hole and I'm at
[47:47] the bottom now Rob and there's no
[47:49] there's no getting out even if I had a
[47:50] ladder I just knock the ladder down I
[47:52] don't want out I'm I'm in this thing for
[47:54] life um I see this and I understand this
[47:57] technology and even if you don't know
[48:00] understand this technology uh completely
[48:02] you don't have to I think of it like the
[48:04] TV right we don't understand where all
[48:05] the capacitors resistors and dodes doing
[48:08] a television set we just have the remote
[48:10] control and we know how to work that
[48:11] well your cell phone now as your remote
[48:13] control so you don't need to you don't
[48:15] need to understand sha 256 encryption
[48:18] and all and and you know all this
[48:20] technical stuff with Bitcoin mining you
[48:22] just got to understand the basics um and
[48:25] you just got to get some even if you
[48:26] didn't understand anything about it if
[48:28] you just bought some and didn't do
[48:29] anything with it it's still going to
[48:30] work for you you don't have to
[48:31] understand it to make it work for you
[48:33] which is really cool so um I encourage
[48:35] anybody out there to keep uh learning
[48:38] about it I'm still learning today after
[48:41] seven seven years in the space I learn
[48:44] stuff almost every day uh and I've
[48:47] learned a lot from your podcast as well
[48:49] so thank you very much I appreciate that
[48:52] um but I don't know if you can ever
[48:54] learn everything if if Michael sailor is
[48:56] still learning
[48:57] I mean you know we've got a lot to learn
[49:00] what are some as you are kind of already
[49:02] in OG with like 2017 you're in uh that's
[49:06] like yeah seven years now it's really
[49:08] long actually um it's fascinating how
[49:11] how far we have already come in in
[49:12] Bitcoin what are some some lessons that
[49:14] you have learned uh uh about Bitcoin
[49:17] that are must knows like if you're a
[49:19] Bitcoin and you you really should know
[49:22] uh those lessons what what can you can
[49:24] you share about Bitcoin lessons maybe
[49:25] even like about life lessons sure I mean
[49:28] you know um I've made some mistakes you
[49:32] know I'm human right and you know there
[49:35] were some pretty good conmen in the
[49:38] space you know we had to go through a
[49:40] pretty hardcore be Market um and uh you
[49:43] know I I made some mistakes what you
[49:45] know one thing I'd say is that Bitcoin
[49:47] Bitcoin doesn't need
[49:49] yield you don't need to earn yield on
[49:51] your Bitcoin bitcoin's got built in
[49:54] yield um which which is really amazing
[49:57] and and it shows it shows the importance
[49:59] that of self- custody right I I'm I'm a
[50:02] big fan of self- custody um I'm also a
[50:04] big fan of not putting all your eggs in
[50:06] one basket and and fortunately even
[50:08] though I I I walked through a Minefield
[50:10] I I I think in the last um in the last
[50:13] be Market where we had a lot of
[50:15] companies imploding um I dodged a few
[50:18] bullets yeah I got hit by one um I I got
[50:21] hit by the Celsius bullet you know I got
[50:24] hit right in the gut with that one but I
[50:27] dodged a couple other bullets you know I
[50:29] got I got grazed in the shoulder and one
[50:31] one flew by my head so at at the end of
[50:34] the day um you know don't don't sit
[50:36] there and try to earn in my opinion
[50:38] don't try to earn yield on your Bitcoin
[50:39] there's a lot of exchanges trying to pay
[50:41] you a little bit of yield by letting
[50:42] them hold your Bitcoin the best thing is
[50:44] self- custody um just put that stuff
[50:47] away and and I still even with self-
[50:49] custody I don't like to put all my eggs
[50:51] in one basket Robin I I don't like uh
[50:54] and I think your previous guest um Mark
[50:57] Hana was also saying the same thing and
[50:59] I agreed with him is you know don't just
[51:01] have all your eggs in one one one place
[51:04] right one basket that's just bad and
[51:06] that saved me through the last bar
[51:08] market is when all these all these all
[51:10] this fraud was being flushed out of the
[51:12] system and all these companies were
[51:14] folding and freezing people's money and
[51:16] people were losing their money
[51:18] fortunately uh I had enough
[51:20] diversification that yeah I took a
[51:22] bullet but I'm okay you know and I
[51:26] learned I learned a valuable lesson you
[51:28] know um Bitcoin was set up for one
[51:30] simple reason don't trust verify right
[51:33] so we don't need to trust with Bitcoin
[51:36] just self- custody it as much as you can
[51:39] I know it's not always possible to self-
[51:41] custody every single thing uh but you
[51:44] know um I do I do dollar cost average
[51:46] and then when I get enough like your
[51:48] previous guest said I then I send it off
[51:50] to Cold Storage I don't you know every
[51:52] time I buy Bitcoin I don't send it off
[51:54] but I when I accumulate a certain amount
[51:56] then send it off to cold storage and
[51:57] that's where it stays um so I think
[52:00] those are valuable lessons is is don't
[52:02] trust because this was set up not to
[52:04] trust we don't have to trust anymore uh
[52:06] we don't have to trust companies we
[52:08] don't have to trust Bad actors in the
[52:09] space or anybody in the space we can
[52:11] just buy and self custody this um and
[52:14] and that's your TR that's that's your
[52:16] security in this space
[52:20] Robin that's that's beautiful I I love
[52:23] that a lot um and I think as the
[52:25] previous guest and and you also like
[52:27] retired and and half Bitcoin it shows
[52:30] like the the power that you're like
[52:33] trusting uh in your retirement uh
[52:36] Bitcoin it's it's I like it a lot how
[52:39] you look at Bitcoin and how how other
[52:41] guests look at Bitcoin um s and there's
[52:45] like one more question to to you as a
[52:47] telecommunication expert or like someone
[52:49] that worked a long time in that field um
[52:52] do you see outside of of money uh use
[52:57] cases in in Bitcoin as Bitcoin also has
[52:59] the the possibilities to send like
[53:01] information and other things on there
[53:03] even like with social medias just
[53:05] sapping each other I mean that's use Cas
[53:08] of money but it's it's it's money that's
[53:10] so EAS uh transferable and you can make
[53:14] so such tiny units of that that you can
[53:16] send like a few cents just to the friend
[53:20] maybe one like is not one like but it's
[53:22] it's one cent in a Satoshi or like just
[53:24] one Satoshi I literally like I I have
[53:27] for example Fountain my podcast is on
[53:28] Fountain and there are people streaming
[53:32] nine sets uh to to me while they're
[53:35] listening and it's it's like amazing
[53:36] because I like wow it's like really like
[53:39] H they they get value from the podcast
[53:42] and then they also give me value with
[53:44] satosi directly um do do you foresee any
[53:47] further use cases for Bitcoin well I
[53:51] think I think one thing that's going to
[53:53] probably happen you know over the next
[53:55] uh 10 to 15 15 years is you know a I
[53:58] think this is been a little off track
[54:00] but I think Bitcoin bitcoin's going to
[54:01] start being priced more in Satoshi
[54:04] people are going to start saying how
[54:05] many Satoshi instead of how many Bitcoin
[54:08] because let's just face it everybody
[54:09] can't own a Bitcoin so it's just like
[54:11] gold went from you know a bar to to
[54:14] ounces right and then and then into
[54:16] grams and in smaller units I think
[54:18] bitcoin's going to continue to be priced
[54:20] in smaller units I even think Satoshi
[54:22] one day are going to be through through
[54:24] you know layer twos like the like the
[54:26] light Network are going to be broken
[54:27] down into micro SATs if you want to name
[54:29] it something right where you know
[54:31] they're going to be able to break a
[54:32] Satoshi down now that doesn't create any
[54:34] you know some people are well that's
[54:35] just going to create in like uh what's
[54:37] his name the the Peter sh Peter shift
[54:40] the gold bug um you know he thinks oh
[54:42] you could just divide a Satoshi you know
[54:44] infinitely and that create well yeah but
[54:46] it doesn't create more Bitcoin you know
[54:47] you can divide a Satoshi but it doesn't
[54:49] create more Bitcoin at the end of the
[54:50] day just like you can shave gold down
[54:51] into into dust it doesn't create you
[54:54] know you shave an ounce of gold down
[54:55] into dust it doesn't create more but at
[54:58] the end of the day I think that um you
[55:01] know are there going to be layer twos
[55:03] built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain I
[55:04] think that that's what you were kind of
[55:05] asking are we going to have other use
[55:07] cases and I think there there are going
[55:09] to be other use cases for the for the
[55:11] Bitcoin um blockchain I don't think it's
[55:13] going to be the the go the go all for
[55:16] everything I just don't think that's
[55:18] possible but and I'm not a you know I'm
[55:21] not a Bitcoin Maxi I I do invest in some
[55:24] some altcoins as well I do think that
[55:26] there are some altcoins that that are
[55:28] going to have use cases and blockchain
[55:30] technology and cryptocurrencies I think
[55:32] are here to stay and and Bitcoin isn't
[55:34] going to be the only one I think you're
[55:36] pretty naive if you actually think that
[55:38] as a as a as a Bitcoin Maxi now you have
[55:40] a right to invest in whatever you want
[55:42] if you just want to hold Bitcoin you
[55:43] can't go wrong with that um what I try
[55:46] to do is I try to leverage up a little
[55:48] bit sometimes and earn get a faster
[55:50] horse for a certain period of time and
[55:52] then you know convert that into more
[55:54] Bitcoin so my my end game is Bitcoin
[55:56] coin but I but I don't think it's the
[55:58] only blockchain and I think that there
[55:59] are going to be a lot of layer twos that
[56:01] get built on bitcoin that can do things
[56:03] that we can't we can't even imagine just
[56:05] like in telecommunications we had no
[56:07] idea that we were going to be having
[56:09] this conversation when phones were first
[56:11] invented I mean the the first phones uh
[56:14] you know Robin I mean they they were
[56:16] they were big and clunky the Motorola
[56:18] brick phones were $3,000 and you could
[56:20] store 10 numbers they were analog you
[56:22] know you got a lot of static and you
[56:24] couldn't do anything with it to have
[56:25] this convers ation all these years later
[56:28] this is the same type of adoption we're
[56:29] going to see on the Bitcoin blockchain
[56:31] it it's anybody's guess where this is
[56:34] going to go because even being in the
[56:35] Telecommunications business and getting
[56:37] in early there was no way in the world I
[56:40] could have guessed where it was going to
[56:42] go and how this was going to was going
[56:44] to wind up now we had people in the
[56:46] industry guessing where it was going to
[56:48] go and they were putting money there
[56:50] Unfortunately they were buying
[56:51] infrastructure and a lot of them lost
[56:54] their money because they guessed wrong
[56:56] with Bitcoin we don't have to guess
[56:57] wrong we can just put into Bitcoin and I
[57:00] think that that alone is going to be
[57:02] good enough we don't have to guess and
[57:03] pick some alternative coins that's all
[57:05] Gamble and speculation in my opinion but
[57:08] I do believe that there are other
[57:09] projects out there that are that are
[57:10] going to be here uh in the long run um
[57:13] and I think we will see a lot of stuff
[57:15] built on the on the Bitcoin blockchains
[57:17] I I I don't know what that looks like um
[57:20] you know I don't think we're going to
[57:21] have communications so much built on it
[57:23] where we're going to be having you know
[57:25] uh video conference and stuff on it I
[57:27] just don't think that kind of stuffff is
[57:28] practical to build on a on a blockchain
[57:30] like that I think I hope that it stays
[57:32] as the as the granite and the foundation
[57:34] of money for its main
[57:37] purpose um and I hope that we don't we
[57:39] don't clog up the blockchain as we've
[57:41] seen in the past sometimes we get these
[57:43] people trying to to build on it and they
[57:45] clog up the blockchain a little bit so
[57:47] I'm hoping that that all that building
[57:49] is more done on layer tws um and and we
[57:53] can we can leave the main blockchain to
[57:55] do what it's supposed to do I don't
[57:56] think it needs to be fixed at all I
[57:58] think it's perfect the way that it is
[58:00] yeah I also think so like the the the
[58:03] the money part of Bitcoin is the most
[58:05] important one if you have a amazing
[58:08] store of value in Bitcoin uh that's the
[58:11] most valuable thing in in the world like
[58:13] nothing comes even close to that like
[58:15] the problem like a solution is always
[58:18] like can only be as valuable as the
[58:21] problem is uh and the problem of where
[58:24] do I store my money like that's the
[58:26] biggest problem of the all and and
[58:28] there's only Bitcoin or not like not
[58:30] only but that the best horse in the race
[58:33] is is Bitcoin for me there are other
[58:35] horses like you can bet on on anything
[58:38] uh but but for me it's like wow that's
[58:40] like the that that's the solution for me
[58:42] where where do I store my financial
[58:45] energy in and it's it's it's so great to
[58:47] see that and uh in the end of the day I
[58:50] was today on a guest uh uh podcast and
[58:54] and and he asked me oh do you see is is
[58:57] Bitcoin here to stay is there any
[58:59] possibility that Bitcoin might go away
[59:00] and I'm like yeah Bitcoin could go away
[59:03] I don't see the possibility like there's
[59:05] a very very small chance that Bitcoin
[59:07] goes away but it's not impossible uh but
[59:11] one thing that doesn't go away is the
[59:14] idea of Bitcoin the idea of sound money
[59:16] the idea of digital scarcity that's now
[59:20] planted in all our heads and it will
[59:22] never go away um I I truly think that
[59:26] Bitcoin will be that uh and and and will
[59:28] deliver that but maybe I'm wrong like I
[59:32] can be wrong uh but the idea is is is in
[59:35] all our heads you know that leads me to
[59:38] a thought that I'd like to share with
[59:39] the audience here um you you had
[59:42] mentioned back in the beginning of this
[59:45] something about inflation and why people
[59:46] don't quite get it sometimes well I one
[59:50] thing that Bitcoin does for everybody
[59:52] that starts learning about it it gives
[59:54] them something that they they didn't
[59:56] learn in school it gives them a
[59:57] financial education and you know when
[60:00] you start measuring real money versus
[60:03] this dirty Fiat this money substitute
[60:06] when you start measuring that and you
[60:08] start seeing the difference you learn
[60:10] real quick about what inflation is and
[60:12] you get a financial education real quick
[60:15] what what I want to tell people and and
[60:18] again I think what's slowing uh things
[60:20] down even just a little bit is most
[60:22] people in the United States do not have
[60:24] a financial education and I was with my
[60:26] accountant the other
[60:28] day and I was trying you know I have to
[60:31] talk crypto to her now because it's it's
[60:33] in my taxes and I learned real quickly
[60:37] that my accountant does not have a
[60:38] financial education and that really
[60:40] shocked me I was I was I couldn't
[60:44] believe it when I was talking to her and
[60:46] I was actually educating her and I
[60:49] thought what's wrong with this picture
[60:50] here she doesn't have a clue of what I'm
[60:53] talking about um you know and and I
[60:56] shocked but one thing I like to do is I
[60:58] like to tell people a little bit um
[61:01] about money because most people don't
[61:03] know what money is and that's the
[61:05] biggest problem we have they think money
[61:08] is and I hate to show this thing again
[61:10] but they think money is this you know
[61:12] Green pieces of paper with dead
[61:14] president's head on it I mean like
[61:16] George Washington if he was alive today
[61:17] do you really think he would endorse
[61:19] knowing what's going on his picture on
[61:20] this piece of paper he'd probably Sue to
[61:23] get his his picture taken off of this
[61:25] because this doesn't represent his core
[61:27] values back then and I think that that
[61:30] alone is fraud putting his picture on
[61:32] here is fraud um but this thing is just
[61:35] littered with fraud and and so what I
[61:37] what I try to do with people as is when
[61:39] I talk to them a little bit about
[61:40] Bitcoin and I
[61:41] evangelized I try to tell them about um
[61:45] what money is and I've come up with an
[61:48] my own uh acronym I guess for money uh
[61:52] so an easy way for people to understand
[61:53] money and I tell them look if you can if
[61:56] you can remember the word tie tie like
[61:59] the neck tie just tie you can kind of
[62:03] remember what money is and I said you
[62:05] know the T stands for technology this
[62:09] people don't think of this as technology
[62:10] but this is technology it's also
[62:13] information that's the I and it's also
[62:16] energy so what our government has done
[62:19] is they become a master at using this
[62:22] technology to blur the information to
[62:25] steal your energy if that makes any
[62:27] sense so they use the information the
[62:31] technology to blur the information to
[62:33] steal your energy because we know the
[62:35] information that they give us about
[62:38] inflation is blurred we know everything
[62:41] that they do with this currency is
[62:45] blurred we can't see it's opaque we we
[62:47] it's it's it's a double entry accounting
[62:49] system right you earn this money Robin
[62:51] you put it in the bank you can't see
[62:53] what the bank does with it so you can't
[62:56] see there with Bitcoin it's a triple
[62:57] entry accounting system the world's
[62:59] first triple entry accounting system
[63:00] where you can actually see every step of
[63:03] where that goes if I have it and I send
[63:05] it to you you can see it from point A to
[63:08] point B there's no hiding it it's a like
[63:11] Michael sailor said and I won't take
[63:12] credit for this but I love it he said
[63:14] Bitcoin is a closed loop Energy System
[63:17] with no leaks every single Satoshi that
[63:20] was ever created is accounted for every
[63:23] single one of these that had ever been
[63:24] created we don't even know how much of
[63:26] this stuff is in circulation has not
[63:28] been accounted for so uh it's it's
[63:31] really it's really fascinating that
[63:33] people that that people still want to
[63:35] save their energy in this when there's
[63:37] something like Bitcoin that's better I
[63:39] don't think anybody that knows about
[63:41] Bitcoin and understands it now wants to
[63:44] save their their energy in this because
[63:47] when you work like you're doing today
[63:48] everybody's working we're working to
[63:50] store our energy to spend it later
[63:52] that's that's the that's the E part of
[63:54] Tai right
[63:56] it we're working hard to put this away
[63:58] to store it later and your time is your
[64:00] energy so imagine you you make a deal to
[64:04] work for this for $16 an hour and you
[64:07] made that deal with somebody you're okay
[64:09] with that deal but what you're not okay
[64:11] with is somebody coming along when
[64:12] you're sleeping at night and scraping a
[64:15] little bit off the top stealing a little
[64:17] bit of that economic energy that you
[64:18] work so hard for that's what Bitcoin
[64:21] fixes Robin and that's why we need it
[64:24] and that's why it's going to to take
[64:26] over I'm I couldn't be more certain and
[64:28] more positive about anything than I am
[64:29] about Bitcoin it it for me it's a
[64:32] no-brainer once you understand the power
[64:34] of Bitcoin wow I I love that a lot um
[64:37] and and you bring up really great points
[64:40] and really great pictures in in the head
[64:41] of of how to explain Bitcoin and and I
[64:43] can see you you probably have like
[64:46] hundreds of of inperson orange pillings
[64:48] I don't know how I mean you did but it's
[64:52] definitely not like your your first ones
[64:55] um really cool there are so many
[64:58] important topics to discuss but maybe we
[65:00] can do a second round because we already
[65:02] over one hour um I have the two uh end
[65:05] routine questions uh the first question
[65:07] is always the same for every guest um
[65:10] what can we learn from you besides all
[65:12] the things that we already talked
[65:14] about yeah you know and that is learned
[65:16] from my mistakes in life because I love
[65:19] to learn from wisdom right so what
[65:22] mistakes did I make in life I got
[65:24] materialistic at a young age I made a
[65:27] lot of money and instead of investing it
[65:29] and I did do investing and I did do some
[65:31] things by default but the truth is Robin
[65:34] until I
[65:35] retired and until I until I turned 50 I
[65:39] didn't have a financial education and
[65:41] I'm not embarrassed to admit that I I
[65:43] just was able to to work and retire
[65:46] because I did some basic things right
[65:48] like you know buy a house for instance
[65:50] right save some money buy some stocks
[65:52] just some basic stuff right that that I
[65:55] didn't know was actually protecting me
[65:57] so much from from the devaluation of the
[65:59] dollar at the time I didn't even think
[66:01] so much about inflation it wasn't until
[66:03] I got into my 50s Robin that I started
[66:05] getting a financial education and
[66:06] learning about how to protect my future
[66:08] because I seen that I seen things
[66:09] changing and I got worried when I when I
[66:12] turned 50 that maybe I don't have enough
[66:14] maybe my retirement isn't going to last
[66:16] right and at that time I also became a
[66:18] minimalist and and started realizing
[66:21] that wow you know I don't need all this
[66:23] stuff and I started downsizing um you
[66:25] know and what I like about Bitcoin is it
[66:27] actually encourages sa it encourages
[66:29] savings Robin which is amazing because
[66:31] this stuff seems to encourage the
[66:33] opposite it seems to encourage people to
[66:35] want to go out and spend right where
[66:37] Bitcoin once you realize you where you
[66:40] can put that energy instead of going out
[66:42] and buying you know the the next Xbox
[66:44] once you realize where you can put that
[66:45] energy and you realize that that Xbox is
[66:48] going to get cheaper over time it
[66:49] actually encourages you to save and it
[66:51] and it and it for me it's it's been a
[66:53] blessing so learn from other people's
[66:55] mistakes out there um not just mine but
[66:58] talk to people learn you've see people
[66:59] that have made mistakes financially you
[67:02] see people that are living over their
[67:03] head people trying to keep up with the
[67:04] Joneses oh my gosh stop that nonsense
[67:07] just stop it it it's just a waste the
[67:11] you know impressing somebody at a red
[67:13] light Robin in a fancy car for 10
[67:15] seconds that I don't know is got to be
[67:18] the biggest waste of money in the world
[67:20] um and you might be surprised when you
[67:22] start when you start learning that less
[67:24] is more
[67:26] how good you feel you know PE people
[67:29] joke about my car that I drive Robin but
[67:30] I'll tell you what I can pull into any
[67:32] gas station and nobody ask me for
[67:34] money it's really it's really a yeah
[67:36] it's it's interesting yeah
[67:39] uh Bitcoin definitely made me also more
[67:42] minimalistic I I talked about I think on
[67:44] the podcast already once about that um I
[67:49] last year uh I bought myself the newest
[67:52] iPhone uh because like I was like ah
[67:55] need it I need it I need it I want it I
[67:57] want it I I do so much on it and then uh
[68:00] a few months ago I was like reflecting
[68:02] on it
[68:03] like why do I need it like do I really
[68:07] need it like what do I do on the phone
[68:09] and I was like okay I write tweets on
[68:11] the phone I reply to YouTube comments on
[68:13] the phone I phone with other people I
[68:17] write WhatsApp messages um I don't do
[68:20] really anything else like I'm not a big
[68:22] picture taker or video taker with the
[68:24] phone for the podcast I have a camera um
[68:27] so why do why do I need a phone and I
[68:30] downgraded from a new iph iPhone was it
[68:34] 14 pro Max to older one like an 11 yeah
[68:39] it's I think an 11 one uh because I was
[68:42] like ah I don't need that and honestly
[68:46] I'm even thinking of downgrading this
[68:47] again like because it's it still feels
[68:50] like an Overkill it still feels like
[68:54] what do I need it for it it has an
[68:56] amazing display it's really fast it has
[68:58] all those amazing apps on there and I
[69:00] never use them
[69:02] like the the the things that I use my
[69:05] phone for is like almost nothing I use
[69:07] I'm I'm a computer guy I sit in in front
[69:09] of my computer a lot uh and the only
[69:12] thing is like I want a good battery life
[69:14] that's the only thing because uh
[69:16] sometimes I'm I'm on a conference and I
[69:18] want to be connected so I need like a
[69:20] whole day uh of battery and and for
[69:23] tweets and stuff like that so that's
[69:24] something that was always uh great but
[69:28] the phone has enough battery so uh it's
[69:30] a small example very small example uh
[69:34] but uh it I think it shows the power of
[69:36] Bitcoin and being more minimalistic
[69:38] being more uh mindful with what do you
[69:41] spend your money on like do you really
[69:43] need uh the the biggest phone and the
[69:46] biggest car the the the a mansion with
[69:48] like seven bedrooms like when when
[69:51] there's nobody visiting you anyways so
[69:53] there's like a lot of questions that you
[69:55] you have to ask yourself and and being
[69:57] mindful with money and this this dos
[69:59] Bitcoin with you and it's great that you
[70:02] brought that point up because I think
[70:03] it's a it's an amazing Point uh that
[70:06] that Bitcoin actually does for you right
[70:09] perfect and congratulations
[70:11] congratulations Robin I think you're
[70:12] going to be a very a very a very wealthy
[70:14] person in life not not just monetarily
[70:16] speaking but it sounds like you're
[70:18] you're on the right path to to riches
[70:21] which is which is measured more than
[70:22] just just in in in dollars or or money
[70:25] money you know being happy healthy
[70:27] family um my biggest priority uh is my
[70:31] health you know because I can't buy my
[70:33] health um so you know focus on your
[70:36] health um you know that that's one of
[70:38] the the biggest uh gifts I can I can
[70:41] spread out there is you can't buy your
[70:43] heal you know you can't buy time you
[70:45] can't buy your health um so try not to
[70:48] sell your time because you can't buy it
[70:51] that that's an amazing learning because
[70:53] um I think the the most important things
[70:56] in life we should always do in the
[70:57] morning like the soon as you end up you
[71:00] should do your number one priority task
[71:02] at least for me because I'm a morning
[71:04] person if you're uh night person that
[71:07] might be shifted around on the head uh
[71:10] so the first thing uh when I stand up I
[71:13] do some workout for example today I
[71:16] stood up at like 5:30 at 6 I was running
[71:19] away and I had like a little bit over 6
[71:21] kilometers I don't know what this is in
[71:23] Miles uh but it was feeling really great
[71:26] it was like 45 minutes what I was
[71:29] running and it is just a nice thing you
[71:31] come home you go for a shower and then
[71:34] the second most important thing is
[71:37] editing my podcast find finding new
[71:39] thumbnails finding new titles yeah in
[71:42] the morning in the mornings I often go
[71:44] um Out start my morning and and I walk
[71:47] and I evangelize I mean it makes me
[71:49] happy I'm you know I'm just out there
[71:52] walking and and I I'm flashing my my
[71:54] Superman Cape you know my my my Bitcoin
[71:57] shirts and I'm just I'm just I'm ready
[72:00] for somebody to say something and I'm
[72:02] ready to start talking about it to
[72:03] anybody who listens and sometimes nobody
[72:05] says anything sometimes I don't talk
[72:07] about it but I'm out there walking and
[72:08] I'm having fun and I feel like I'm
[72:10] helping people and I'm and I'm really
[72:12] waking people up and making the world a
[72:14] better place I know I've changed some
[72:15] lives and to me that you know that's
[72:18] that's a that's a great gift I don't I'm
[72:20] not out here doing this to make any
[72:22] money off of a podcast or I'm not on
[72:24] social media that's okay if people are
[72:26] making their living doing that I can
[72:27] certainly appreciate that for me I'm not
[72:29] out there on the streets beating the
[72:30] streets I'm retired already so I've done
[72:33] what I needed to do in life get to where
[72:34] I am you know I'm just here trying to
[72:37] protect my retirement and trying to help
[72:39] people protect theirs as well so I think
[72:41] we're on the same Mission Robin
[72:43] congratulations really cool I appreciate
[72:45] that a lot going around and and actively
[72:48] trying to the orange pild the world I
[72:49] think that's that's that's what we
[72:51] really need and and it's really cool
[72:53] that that you're doing that the crow
[72:55] Roots movement bottom up and I love that
[72:57] a lot perfect then let's come to the end
[72:59] routine of our podcast where the
[73:01] previous guest is asking a question for
[73:02] the next guest without knowing who the
[73:04] next guest actually is it feels like
[73:06] that sentence comes fast and faster over
[73:09] my lips more I said it but the question
[73:12] for you is what does freedom really mean
[73:15] to
[73:16] you yeah you know as you get older you
[73:19] think more and more about it like your
[73:21] last again Mark Hana there were talking
[73:24] about his freedom he actually left the
[73:25] country um freedom freedom to me means
[73:29] everything and I and I see our as our as
[73:33] our dollars being debased Robin what
[73:35] I've seen in my 60 years on the planet
[73:37] here in the United States I'm watching
[73:39] it debase everything it's debasing our
[73:41] constitution as well so the more money
[73:43] they're printing the you know it in my
[73:46] opinion the debasement of our currency
[73:49] in fiat currency the dollar the
[73:51] debasement of that it is not compatible
[73:54] with the Constitution so as they're
[73:56] debasing our currency they have to rip
[73:58] apart our freedom in our Constitution
[74:00] that we used to have that protected us
[74:02] the things that are going on in America
[74:03] now scare me the the Civil asset
[74:06] forfeitures that are going on out here
[74:07] in our country I don't know if you have
[74:09] it where you're at but you know any
[74:11] American needs to look up civil asset
[74:13] forfeiture um and learn that their
[74:15] freedoms you know it'll scare you our
[74:17] freedoms are being are being just robbed
[74:20] from us so don't give up your freedom
[74:23] fight for it you know because once we
[74:24] give it up once you give up Freedom it's
[74:26] really hard to get it back so freedom to
[74:29] me means everything I mean I've it's at
[74:31] a point now where um I'm like your last
[74:34] guest I'm thinking I'm considering a
[74:36] second passport Margaret already has a
[74:37] second passport and we spend a lot of
[74:39] time in Europe usually the Summers we go
[74:41] we go to Europe and so um we've already
[74:44] got another flat over there that that's
[74:46] you know that's that that that's rented
[74:48] out but I'm thinking about getting
[74:49] something else to maintain my freedom
[74:51] because I'm not feeling like I have a
[74:54] lot of freedom fre here anymore in the
[74:55] United States I see what's happening and
[74:57] it's only going to get worse as as this
[74:59] corruption it's it's kind of like the
[75:01] whole system is decaying it's collapsing
[75:03] in on itself Rob we see all this
[75:05] political uh divide we are so divided as
[75:08] a nation now it's ridiculous I mean I
[75:10] even wouldn't want to put a bumper
[75:11] sticker on my car now for fear that
[75:14] somebody would vandalize my car because
[75:16] I'm supporting this candidate or that
[75:19] candidate and so the debasement of the
[75:21] currency is also debasing our political
[75:24] uh class as well it the whole thing is
[75:26] eating itself it's it's just devouring
[75:28] itself and along with that comes our
[75:30] freedom uh we lose our freedom you know
[75:33] we're done bit Bitcoin can can can give
[75:35] you a lot of that freedom back having a
[75:37] second passport can give you a lot of
[75:38] freedom back so um Freedom means means
[75:41] everything to me and I think that people
[75:43] should have a plan B to maintain that
[75:45] freedom uh it it it it's what makes
[75:47] Freedom Is My Hope for the future I Want
[75:50] to Be Free as I get older into my
[75:52] retirement I don't want to be sitting
[75:53] here protecting myself from tyranny from
[75:55] from money printers I hope that that
[75:58] answers your question
