[00:00] the richest and most powerful country in
[00:02] the world signaling that they will get
[00:05] as many Bitcoin as they can as fast as
[00:07] they can which triggers the whole game
[00:09] theory about nation states once large
[00:12] nation states with vibrant economies and
[00:15] strong geopolitical influence do that it
[00:17] will trigger the kind of fomo we cannot
[00:19] imagine we are left behind as we were
[00:22] with internet with AI with so many
[00:25] technological Revolution we will feel
[00:27] Our Fate as an open Air Museum are
[00:30] really closer to its hand than what most
[00:33] people think we see that our economy is
[00:35] collapsing we just hit a record in
[00:37] bankruptcy our debt is out of control
[00:39] the government expedit in the GDP are
[00:42] 60% of the GDP so it's the same level as
[00:46] in the USSR in the' 70s 40% of the
[00:49] working age population is working for
[00:51] the government we don't have energy
[00:52] security and the cost of servicing the
[00:55] debt is getting out of control I don't
[00:57] see a painless way out of this Cris I
[01:00] could make the case that in 3 years time
[01:03] the Euro will be past
[01:04] [Music]
[01:08] history you studied data science and
[01:11] then you worked like a little bit like
[01:12] four years into that has that influenced
[01:14] how you look at Bitcoin or uh yeah I
[01:17] discovered Bitcoins through data science
[01:19] but in a kind of serene depit way um I
[01:23] was working at Oracle uh back in the
[01:25] days and uh basically I was um
[01:29] interested in a software licensing
[01:31] problem that some software uh
[01:34] distributor have with on premise
[01:36] software and I stubbled upon a thesis of
[01:40] computer science uh written by some guy
[01:43] in Australia which basically explained
[01:45] that you could use Bitcoin underlying
[01:47] technology to solve this problem and
[01:49] that's how I was uh introduced to
[01:51] Bitcoin in the first place interesting
[01:54] so that played a big role even in in uh
[01:57] discovering Bitcoin for you how's that
[01:59] influence your thinking of of Bitcoin
[02:01] maybe different to to other
[02:03] people excuse me uh how how like I think
[02:07] like data scientists are really looking
[02:10] at problems in a different way when you
[02:12] look at like data and you look at the
[02:14] actual facts uh versus maybe less
[02:17] emotional to that sense how is that
[02:20] influenced how you look at Bitcoin how
[02:23] you explain Bitcoin how you see Bitcoin
[02:26] um that's a good question I'm not sure
[02:29] it has
[02:30] had that large an influence um because
[02:35] when I discovered Bitcoin um uh first I
[02:40] didn't understand it really well like I
[02:43] was at first I was drawn to etherum
[02:46] because it was like more user friendly
[02:49] uh more general purpose and stuff like
[02:51] that and so I I must confess I didn't
[02:56] understand like uh the whole game theory
[02:59] monetary economics history of money uh
[03:03] Financial history that helps you
[03:06] understand the role Bitcoin has to play
[03:09] that came after and so my Bitcoin my
[03:13] Bitcoin journey in itself was more um uh
[03:18] on that uh plan like uh I understood
[03:22] Bitcoin uh well once I got interested in
[03:27] uh economics history of economic
[03:28] thoughts um after I've read some aan
[03:32] economics uh and this kind of knowledge
[03:36] helps me um discovered Bitcoin and so I
[03:40] I understand Bitcoin through this lens
[03:43] more than data science I would say data
[03:46] science my data science background was
[03:48] uh rather helpful to um use data to
[03:53] write about Bitcoin and to analyze it uh
[03:57] both from a nonchain uh uh analysis
[04:00] perspective and also from a pure let's
[04:04] say mathematical Finance perspective
[04:08] super interesting you said that you got
[04:10] into etherum more because it had a
[04:12] better user
[04:14] interface how how was how was that like
[04:17] like what was better on on the for the
[04:19] user interface
[04:21] so when I entered this when I entered
[04:24] this space so just after leaving Oracle
[04:26] it was like 2016 just after eum Ico and
[04:31] there was a lot of marketing material
[04:33] out there um it was also at that time
[04:36] that you had the economist uh um Edition
[04:41] about like the blockchain the trust
[04:43] machine all the around like
[04:44] blockchain technology so back in the
[04:47] days if you were a young guy such as me
[04:50] looking info about like blockchain
[04:52] technology most of the results you would
[04:55] get would be about like decentralized
[04:57] application smart contract and stuff
[04:59] like that and once uh the first ethereum
[05:03] clients were available it was like easy
[05:06] to to to to use uh even for someone like
[05:11] me with not that uh a good technical
[05:16] background in the sense that I was like
[05:19] more um doing mathematics in data
[05:22] science uh I'm not a developer by
[05:24] formation uh I was in business school so
[05:28] um I get
[05:30] uh due to my limited technical
[05:33] background like uh ethereum was more
[05:36] appealing and it's only like um 18
[05:40] months later
[05:42] once I um first I I had difficulties
[05:46] wrapping my head around some simple
[05:49] Concepts about how Market Works uh
[05:52] especially in the context of like
[05:54] decentralized financial application
[05:56] toomics on ethereum and stuff like that
[05:58] and so I decided to uh basically uh
[06:01] self-educate in economics in finance and
[06:04] in economic history and that's through
[06:07] that lens that I understand that yeah
[06:09] ethereum was uh kind of clunky not
[06:12] sustainable in the long run and uh at
[06:16] the opposite like Bitcoin was there for
[06:18] the ages and solving a real uh problem
[06:21] uh that you can miss at the beginning of
[06:23] course but that is way more uh important
[06:27] and that has way more chances to succeed
[06:30] than this kind of vaporware description
[06:33] of a world
[06:35] computer interesting I have for me I I
[06:38] was a little bit in shitcoins and I was
[06:40] a little in altcoins but I was like ah
[06:42] it this doesn't make sense too much but
[06:45] yeah I quickly got into uh Bitcoin only
[06:48] stuff um what are your thoughts on um
[06:52] then on things on top of Bitcoin we have
[06:55] uh um for example ordinals but there's
[06:58] all a lot of other things that that you
[07:00] can put on on bitcoin that kind of have
[07:03] altcoin wipes I would say uh but on top
[07:07] of uh of of Bitcoin so the way I think
[07:10] about it is like is it sound from a
[07:13] technical perspective and is it uh like
[07:16] a good use case in the same way that you
[07:18] would analyze a company for example of
[07:20] course it's different but you can use
[07:23] the similar Frameworks and my contention
[07:26] with most of what is developed on Smart
[07:29] contract blockchain is that uh it is it
[07:32] scores bad in both dimensions in the
[07:35] sense that technically speaking most of
[07:37] the time it's not secure uh it's uh
[07:41] presents with lots of attack vectors of
[07:44] ability to manipulate and when it's
[07:47] successful it blots the Shain because um
[07:50] it's a trade-off right either you have
[07:52] something that is easy to use and
[07:55] anybody can develop its own smart
[07:57] contract its own shitcoin but at the end
[07:59] of the day you will have so many
[08:01] transaction eating the chain at the same
[08:03] time that you will have scalability
[08:05] issues which can only be solved at the
[08:09] the ground layer by centralization and
[08:11] that's why after ethereum all the smart
[08:14] contract blockchain that uh um um that
[08:19] emerg to compu the serum where more
[08:21] centralized you can think of BNB chain
[08:24] or Solana for for instance and on the
[08:28] like um like business model and and
[08:31] utility front uh I think that uh
[08:36] basically most of what remains Mo most
[08:40] of what uh still has fraction uh in this
[08:44] uh ecosystems is what we call Defi and
[08:47] to me it's neither decentralized nor
[08:50] Finance uh in the sense that Finance at
[08:54] its core is a function of intermediating
[08:58] uh savings and investment M and to do
[09:01] that you cannot step outside contracts
[09:05] property laws and stuff like that
[09:06] because if for example I have savings
[09:09] and I want to give them to an
[09:12] entrepreneur that will use them to uh
[09:14] build a business and generate
[09:17] productivity and maybe give me a return
[09:20] then um we had like 250 years of inst
[09:25] institutional contracts uh emerging from
[09:28] the social order to protect the investor
[09:30] to align interest between uh different
[09:32] shareholders in this setup and uh
[09:36] basically the whole idea of defy and
[09:40] tokens and stuff like that discard all
[09:43] of that which is completely uh uh it's
[09:47] first it's uberis and then it's kind of
[09:49] stupid because if we invented these
[09:52] institutions in the first place that's
[09:54] because they are really helpful and
[09:57] really useful to avoid for example
[09:59] entrepreneurs getting capital and being
[10:02] liquid from day one and just deciding
[10:05] not to build anything because uh it's
[10:07] easier for them to get rich by marketing
[10:10] what they will do instead of really
[10:11] doing it and even if they are successful
[10:16] uh we have this thing called like uh uh
[10:19] corporations with like uh um accounting
[10:22] practices with like stocks with like
[10:25] different senority on depth instruments
[10:27] and stuff like that that basically
[10:29] structures the claims of different
[10:31] investor within a corporation whereas uh
[10:35] when you hold the token you have no
[10:37] guarantee that the success of your
[10:39] business will directly translate in
[10:42] financial success for you so all in all
[10:45] uh I think there is like great uh um
[10:49] things to develop on top of Bitcoin to
[10:52] facilitate some kind of uh Financial uh
[10:57] contracts but um I would um discard the
[11:01] idea that uh one we will like get rid of
[11:06] the whole financial system because of it
[11:08] because we will still need Capital
[11:09] allocators intermediaries to do that
[11:12] some kind of trust you know and um at
[11:15] the end of the day like we formed
[11:18] institution in the past to do that such
[11:20] as the rule of law uh and all the
[11:22] institutions I I mentioned before and I
[11:25] don't see that disappearing but if you
[11:28] look at different construct for example
[11:30] like money market fund basically a money
[11:32] market fund for your audience is
[11:35] something like taser it's like a fund um
[11:40] that will get take your dollars invest
[11:43] them in short-term treasury bills so the
[11:45] most liquid and safe uh uh Securities
[11:49] out there and the the only job of the
[11:53] fund manager is to make sure that uh it
[11:56] stays on par meaning that the
[11:58] liabilities are less than the assets
[12:01] that like the share issues uh worth each
[12:05] $1 are backed by corresponding amount of
[12:09] dollar denominated Securities which is
[12:11] exactly what teser does uh in a money
[12:14] market fund though um the shareholders
[12:16] get a return uh based on the underlying
[12:19] Securities held by the fund and uh I
[12:23] think for example like the future of
[12:24] stable coin will be something like that
[12:27] like for example you can imagine some
[12:29] construct whereby you issue tokens or
[12:33] cryptographic signatures or some kind of
[12:36] ecash mint whatever the construct and on
[12:39] the other side you have like a blend of
[12:43] onchain Bitcoin associated with uh
[12:46] Bitcoin short position basically
[12:48] derivatives making them uh at SP with
[12:51] dollars and reaping funding rates
[12:54] rewards um because when you are short
[12:57] Bitcoin basically you are facilitating
[12:58] people
[12:59] wanting to be long and because more
[13:02] people on average wants to be long than
[13:04] short Bitcoin they have to pay you for
[13:06] the privilege of getting that exposure
[13:09] and so that way you could like recreate
[13:12] something that already existed in the
[13:14] fat traditional world uh that is Battle
[13:17] tested that serve a real purpose in the
[13:19] financial system that really has value
[13:21] that really has use but you can leverage
[13:24] the Bitcoin Network such that this kind
[13:27] of product inherits some of of Bitcoin
[13:30] desirable properties such as it's
[13:32] auditable directly on chain you don't
[13:34] have to trust an intermediary you can do
[13:37] creation and redemptions automatically
[13:39] without going through an intermediary so
[13:41] it's also sensorship resistant and such
[13:44] uh kind of properties also it can be um
[13:48] um
[13:49] cryptographically uh managed so it's
[13:51] more efficient than human management so
[13:56] that's it's kind of a long answer but
[13:58] that's my my my two sents on on yeah
[14:01] defi it's interesting is the thing that
[14:05] you said in the beginning was really
[14:06] true uh the only defi is
[14:09] Bitcoin only only financial system that
[14:12] is decentralized is is Bitcoin every the
[14:16] things that we call defa as you said are
[14:18] not decentralized maybe have something
[14:20] to do with money but not really uh I
[14:24] excuse me to interrupt but I would even
[14:27] contest that like uh the the kind of
[14:30] light bu moment I had when I understood
[14:32] that like Define on other chain uh
[14:36] wouldn't work was the moment I
[14:39] understood that like all Finance is
[14:41] based on money so you have to have an
[14:44] under genous money on your network that
[14:48] gains value uh for its uh
[14:52] characteristics as money and then on top
[14:55] of that you will have the liquidity to
[14:57] build uh more more complex Financial
[15:00] contracts whereas on Smart contract
[15:02] change they tackle the problem uh
[15:05] backwards where they try first to
[15:09] develop utility for financial contracts
[15:12] and Sly D and thereafter they notice
[15:14] that ah doesn't seem to work well
[15:17] because our underlying token is not
[15:19] really money by the way so yeah let's
[15:21] wrap Bitcoin which is real money on our
[15:23] Network in order to be able to do uh
[15:26] more interesting stuff which is kind
[15:29] kind of uh an admonition that uh they
[15:33] didn't tackle the problem in the in the
[15:35] in the correct
[15:37] order H how will that look on a Bitcoin
[15:41] standard do you imagine some some uh
[15:44] money markets native on bitcoin some
[15:47] money uh things natively on bitcoin
[15:49] maybe even like a stock market natively
[15:51] on on bitcoin how do you see that in the
[15:53] future oh I'm sure about that um I even
[15:56] wrote an article for um
[15:59] BTC which is a Bitcoin only Venture
[16:03] Capital fund created by Alan farington
[16:06] and other
[16:07] bitcoiners um where I explain exactly
[16:10] this kind of construct which I call
[16:12] Bitcoin money market fund and my thesis
[16:14] is that it's one of the way we will get
[16:17] uh toward the Bitcoin standard because
[16:19] it's a way in which Bitcoin is poised to
[16:23] monetize some asset classes especially
[16:26] fixed income because uh the kind kind of
[16:29] um value that are seeking like fixed
[16:32] income investors um is not quite
[16:35] addressable with Bitcoin right now even
[16:37] though like what Michael Sor doing could
[16:39] be a good counter example to to to that
[16:43] but in the sense that most F income
[16:45] investor are thinking like stability
[16:48] with uh higher than inflation returns
[16:52] and really low risk which is something
[16:55] that is better delivered with uh this
[16:58] kind of imaginary construct I put forth
[17:01] a Bitcoin money market fund than with
[17:03] Bitcoin uh than with being long Bitcoin
[17:06] itself in maybe like for example five to
[17:08] 10 years when uh volatility will be much
[17:12] lower in Bitcoin I would have a
[17:14] different opinion but to bridge the gap
[17:16] to go from where we are now to there I
[17:19] think there is a compelling argument to
[17:21] make that Bitcoin could monetize in
[17:24] different ways some people would like to
[17:28] hold bitco coin uh um directly because I
[17:31] understand that yeah the returns are
[17:33] really worth the volatility um and some
[17:37] others that maybe are not Bitcoin or for
[17:39] example you can imagine for example a
[17:41] big Pension funds that has a a huge
[17:43] liability problem especially in Europe
[17:45] for example because of demographics low
[17:47] growth and stuff like that unable to get
[17:49] the returns it needs on the fixed income
[17:51] Market just tapping into this kind of
[17:54] fixed income Market on bitcoin to get
[17:56] the desired return so they don't NE
[17:58] necessarily need to like Bitcoin or
[18:00] being or or being bitcoiners but the
[18:03] incent incentive structure is such that
[18:06] in my opinion they will do it at at some
[18:09] point another another example could be
[18:11] like sanction countries if you have for
[18:13] if you are for example gas prom one of
[18:15] the biggest uh company in Russia which
[18:18] is like a partly state owned uh Gas and
[18:23] energy company uh they have like um
[18:26] Financial dealings and operations uh
[18:28] across the world in different currencies
[18:31] with bank accounts across the world but
[18:33] now there there are sanctions because of
[18:34] the the war in in Russia and the
[18:37] sanction we we we enforced on on Russia
[18:40] on Russian residents and Russian
[18:42] companies and so if I were for example
[18:45] um um CFO at gas prom uh I could totally
[18:50] like try to convince my board that yeah
[18:53] uh the safest way we have to hold
[18:55] dollars now is hold some kind of proxy
[18:59] in the Bitcoin money market fund because
[19:01] that way um the Federal Reserve the dog
[19:05] and any other uh Western institution
[19:08] cannot prevent us from using it
[19:10] especially in international trade uh and
[19:14] uh funnily enough this is kind of what
[19:18] Putin said recently in an interview
[19:21] where he demonstrated that he kind of
[19:25] gets Bitcoin in the sense that it's
[19:27] censorship resistant it's not going away
[19:29] and so people we will will use it
[19:33] because they have use for it um so yeah
[19:37] um I I sorry I I forgot your qu your
[19:40] initial question my initial question was
[19:43] just about uh how the money market fund
[19:46] stock market all the financial system
[19:48] will look like on a Bitcoin standup yeah
[19:51] and also so I think like you will have
[19:54] this kind of construct but as we get
[19:56] closer to hyperbitcoinization
[19:58] I think they will slowly fade away for
[20:01] the simple reason that um most of our
[20:05] financial system is uh as any Financial
[20:08] system as we said before is built on
[20:09] money and our current fat money is also
[20:12] built on the promise of inflation so
[20:15] that's a reason why we have so many
[20:17] fixed income instruments so much debt uh
[20:20] and so little in in some sense some
[20:23] little direct Equity Holdings from
[20:26] people uh uh uh Incorporated
[20:29] and as uh many other bitcoiners for
[20:33] example the I think the most well known
[20:35] for this position being save damus um I
[20:38] think that Bitcoin adoption will create
[20:41] some kind of re
[20:44] equitization uh of the economy whereby
[20:46] people will be slowly decentivize
[20:49] to uh take on more depths and to uh
[20:53] issue debt because it will be quite a
[20:55] dangerous proposition to issue debt
[20:57] under on Bitcoin standard but if I want
[21:01] to have like some exposure to a business
[21:04] because I believe in the the the
[21:06] business model the entrepreneur whatever
[21:09] um it would be a better bargain for me
[21:11] to just be a direct Equity investor
[21:13] because that way I have basically the
[21:15] same downside because either the company
[21:17] fails and it won't be able to to
[21:20] reimburse uh debts in Bitcoin or it
[21:22] succeeds and then I also get a share of
[21:25] The Upside and not a fixed return uh um
[21:29] the fixed return I would get with fixed
[21:31] income instrument so in N like changing
[21:35] the incentives change the behaviors of
[21:37] financial uh Market participants uh and
[21:40] especially issuers uh and I because they
[21:43] have to CER to to what uh uh investors
[21:46] demand and I don't see investor
[21:49] demanding that much fixed income on a
[21:51] Bitcoin standard so that would be that
[21:54] and also I think regarding like the
[21:57] stock market that at some point we will
[22:00] have like uh stocks denominated in
[22:03] Bitcoin balance sheets uh with Bitcoin
[22:05] AI uh at our company at bu Bitcoin
[22:08] that's already how internally we do
[22:11] financial analysis like we don't care
[22:14] like what's our uh growth margin in fat
[22:18] what's our cash flow in fat we don't
[22:20] care about that we only uh try to
[22:22] measure how effective we are at uh
[22:26] investing capital in order to get
[22:27] Bitcoin return returns and obviously
[22:30] being able to bit uh just a long idle
[22:34] position in Bitcoin and regarding the
[22:37] trading of stock itself I also think
[22:40] that uh maybe some construct on top of
[22:43] Bitcoin some stuff like side chain like
[22:45] liquid can help clean uh uh the current
[22:49] market structure because now um uh like
[22:53] to to to to try to convey my point you
[22:56] have to understand that when you trade
[22:58] Securities now they are listed on a
[23:00] specific exchange like for example the
[23:02] New York Stock Exchange and everything
[23:04] is cleared centrally at this institution
[23:08] and
[23:09] that's basically that's open the way to
[23:12] stuff like high frequency trading
[23:15] whereby the closer to uh the settlement
[23:18] layer the settlement server you are um
[23:22] the better you are able to front run
[23:24] other Traders and basically taxing them
[23:28] for or uh nothing uh and living upon uh
[23:33] like uh the value created in the economy
[23:36] that's contributing to nothing whereas
[23:39] if for example uh you have a settlement
[23:42] that is done uh through a side chain for
[23:44] example as liquid with maybe also
[23:47] confidential transaction and stuff like
[23:49] that this kind of free rider Behavior
[23:53] are not possible anymore so marginally
[23:56] speaking uh there are this kind of of
[23:58] perks that we can unlock once we get uh
[24:02] a good money uh with uh uh the pro we
[24:07] can leverage its native programability
[24:10] to build like financial markets that are
[24:14] like better in the sense that incentives
[24:17] are better align uh between like issuers
[24:21] Traders uh regulators and stuff like
[24:24] that that's super interesting uh
[24:27] especially when we think about
[24:29] uh how the world looks on a Bitcoin
[24:31] standard and I think that will be really
[24:33] uh interesting to see but you said you
[24:36] also in the company bull Bitcoin um you
[24:40] measure your success in in Bitcoin so
[24:44] you measure the revenue in Bitcoin you
[24:46] measure when you do Investments how many
[24:49] Bitcoins put did you put in how much how
[24:51] many Bitcoin you get got out like how
[24:53] how do you do that so basically we do
[24:56] like normal accounting like regular
[24:58] accounting but we also um like um
[25:03] express it in Bitcoin like it's just a
[25:05] different spreadsheet you know basically
[25:07] um and you don't see this thing uh
[25:10] through the same lens because for
[25:12] example if we were not good at our job
[25:16] um we could like just have growing
[25:18] revenues because bitcoin price is
[25:21] ripping you know uh and whereas when you
[25:25] measure it in Bitcoin you are truly um
[25:29] measuring uh your own ability to
[25:32] allocate Capital uh properly in order to
[25:35] get return because like it's it's so
[25:38] easy to to to beat the hurdle rate of
[25:41] fat in some sense just buy stock and go
[25:43] to the beach you know like just buy an
[25:46] S&P 500 ETF and go to the beach and
[25:48] that's the core reason why our economy
[25:50] is broken and so kind of our way through
[25:55] because we are all kind of on a coin
[25:58] standard uh in the company we understand
[26:01] that uh it's not satisfactory to only
[26:04] measure our success in this uh stupid uh
[26:07] measure system and so we also try to um
[26:12] look at it uh that way and it the way
[26:18] you can understand it is like if for
[26:21] example we decide to invest uh uh uh
[26:23] money to develop a new product line um
[26:27] we will measure the success of this
[26:29] product line uh very simply by saying
[26:33] like we invested uh uh that many Bitcoin
[26:37] uh uh to develop it and then uh it it
[26:41] hit the market uh maybe we had customers
[26:44] because they like it and we generate
[26:46] revenue and if in the long run the
[26:49] revenue exceeds our cost in Bitcoin
[26:51] terms it was a good use of capital if uh
[26:54] it's not it was not a good use of
[26:56] capital and so it gets you back to
[26:59] economic calculation which is basically
[27:01] the essence uh of capitalism and why it
[27:04] works and um even at the micro level of
[27:08] a company I think it's really help you
[27:12] st your company towards way better
[27:14] decision making because uh in some sense
[27:18] you won't um dilapidate your Capital uh
[27:22] uh that easily on frivolous useless
[27:24] thing each time you make a decision uh
[27:28] you really think hard about like what's
[27:30] the opportunity cost what's are what are
[27:32] the risk what could we do that is better
[27:35] with uh these Bitcoins and it totally
[27:38] changed the way you operate as a capital
[27:40] allocator it definitely will change a
[27:43] lot and it's also interesting for me
[27:45] because this year is the first time
[27:46] where I get paid in bit first year where
[27:48] I get it paid in Bitcoin uh and it is
[27:53] probably frustrating to see uh how
[27:57] little your Reven Rue will grow in
[28:00] Bitcoin terms because you really have to
[28:03] level up your game massively to get more
[28:07] paid in the in the next year than the
[28:09] previous year uh so that will be really
[28:12] interesting and that is probably also uh
[28:15] interesting for a company to see as a
[28:17] motivator like oh I I want to beat the
[28:19] Bitcoin income uh if if you just measure
[28:23] it in US dollar yeah of course you can
[28:25] like you you probably grow your income
[28:27] if if you have the same dollar Revenue
[28:31] this year than last year you lost but if
[28:34] you have the same Bitcoin income than
[28:36] last year that's quite good like that
[28:39] that's some that's like twox in in US
[28:41] Dollars basic basically that's a really
[28:44] good uh success story but in Bitcoin
[28:47] terms you like you have to really look
[28:48] at how many STS are you getting per
[28:50] month uh and is is that the same amount
[28:54] or more than you got a year ago it's an
[28:58] interesting uh using Bitcoin as a
[29:01] unitive account is kind of a
[29:03] superpower uh to to your company and you
[29:05] also to your personal life like just
[29:08] even if you don't get paid in Bitcoin
[29:09] you can convert it directly into Bitcoin
[29:12] or at least the the amount that you
[29:14] don't need and see like okay the amount
[29:17] that I don't need on a monthly basis
[29:19] that I can directly uh exchange for
[29:21] Bitcoin what is that in Bitcoin terms
[29:24] and is that amount growing or shrinking
[29:27] uh in in in satosi I think that's a
[29:29] really interesting way to look at it and
[29:32] it's probably really motivating for
[29:34] people to think about that and it makes
[29:37] makes me think of two things like um
[29:40] it's a good example because it also
[29:42] shows you that there we can like explain
[29:46] uh Bitcoin growth in price by two
[29:49] Dynamics uh the first one being like
[29:52] it's just less inflationary so it's
[29:54] better money it's better at holding
[29:56] purchasing power uh over over time and
[29:59] but also it's an adoption like uh it's
[30:03] it's it follows like the the classical
[30:05] like s adoption curve technology uh if
[30:08] you look for example uh at the number of
[30:12] nonzero addresses on the blockchain and
[30:14] you compare it like to different
[30:16] Technologies and stuff like that you
[30:17] will see like this kind of exponential
[30:20] growth and as more people use Bitcoin it
[30:23] also gains value because it's a network
[30:25] good so the more people use it the
[30:28] better utility you have for it as money
[30:31] as a spending tool as a unit of account
[30:33] and stuff like that so of course because
[30:36] we are in the early days still I I guess
[30:39] um this kind of adoption is quite stiff
[30:42] and it's for for like like just an just
[30:46] employees for example it's it's really
[30:48] difficult to grow your your cash flow
[30:50] and productivity uh as fast as uh the
[30:54] adoption but uh once we reach
[30:58] larger uh uh adoption um of course the
[31:02] rate of return will slow and I think it
[31:04] will be easier to achieve what you
[31:07] described and the other thing uh I
[31:09] wanted to add is that basically what you
[31:12] described is a COR is a coral of uh
[31:15] economic calculation but uh for like
[31:18] employees incentives and career
[31:20] management and stuff like that and I
[31:23] think um Bitcoin companies at least ADB
[31:27] Bitcoin we are finding out that
[31:29] operating on the Bitcoin standard also
[31:32] change a little bit the way we think
[31:35] about like uh uh employee employers
[31:38] relationship about like incentives and
[31:41] fixed salaries and stuff like that for
[31:44] example um I think like many people will
[31:48] like having like a a like a salary
[31:52] expressed in Fiat um and as you
[31:56] mentioned the down side of that is that
[31:59] like especially during bull market they
[32:01] will get less Bitcoin each month uh um
[32:05] with the same fat salary but they could
[32:08] also like if they are talented if like
[32:11] they're really needed by the company
[32:13] they could also leverage uh this
[32:16] position to ask for bonuses uh directly
[32:19] in Bitcoin or for an investment on uh
[32:22] revenues and stuff like that and in that
[32:25] sense uh your wealth is also Al growing
[32:28] with the company so as long as the
[32:30] company does a good job to earn return
[32:33] on bitcoin as we mentioned before and as
[32:36] long as you are really providing value
[32:38] that is difficult to replace to your own
[32:39] company it's something that you will be
[32:41] able to monetize uh for yourself and
[32:44] gets more sets out of it I partnered up
[32:47] with coin vigilante this is the most
[32:50] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever

[35:00] get more
[35:01] sets really cool um what are your
[35:04] thoughts on on this year it has been
[35:06] crazy uh this this episode is really
[35:08] close to to the end of the year already
[35:12] uh I I can only recap really quickly
[35:15] with like ETF Haring 100K Trump is like
[35:18] the the four four highlights that I see
[35:21] right now what are some of your
[35:23] highlights this year and uh yeah uh how
[35:26] did you see this year
[35:28] so yeah a lot of things happened this
[35:31] year I would also maybe like mention uh
[35:34] sailor going like full uh Steam on its
[35:39] speculative attack maybe also like as we
[35:43] we discussed before uh the comments of
[35:46] certain head of States especially Putin
[35:48] like that like just change the Overton
[35:52] window regarding Bitcoin and maybe also
[35:56] uh what happened with uh the samurai
[35:59] developers uh which is in my opinion
[36:02] really important uh for the future of
[36:04] Bitcoin and open software in general and
[36:07] maybe lastly also like the the the
[36:10] generally speaking the macro situation
[36:12] with like uh the word clearly uh
[36:16] breaking into two poles um and one way
[36:22] to look at that it's like it's the
[36:23] perfect environment for Bitcoin because
[36:26] um first as you mentioned we have like
[36:29] the like richest and most powerful
[36:32] country in the world uh um just like
[36:36] signaling that they will uh uh get as
[36:39] many Bitcoin as they can as fast as they
[36:41] can which uh kind of trigger the whole
[36:45] game theory about nation states some a
[36:49] topic that has been discussed in Bitcoin
[36:51] circles for years um and that always
[36:55] seemed uh kind of pie in the
[36:58] sky for Outsiders like many people I
[37:01] Tred to to explain this this idea that
[37:04] once uh like large uh uh nation states
[37:09] with like vibrant
[37:11] economies and and and strong
[37:14] geopolitical influence do that it will
[37:16] kind of Tri it will trigger the kind of
[37:18] fomo we cannot imagine uh with the kind
[37:21] of money that is difficult to grasp um
[37:25] and it's funny because as we are
[37:27] recording ing this just yesterday I saw
[37:30] some um German um parliamentary uh in
[37:35] the Bund tag uh uh just saying what are
[37:39] we doing in Europe we should uh um like
[37:42] follow the the us because if they do
[37:45] that and we we we are left behind as uh
[37:49] we were with internet with AI with so
[37:52] many technological Revolution uh we will
[37:56] um basically uh just seal Our Fate as an
[38:00] open an open air
[38:02] museum like in in some sense like Europe
[38:05] is becoming like what what Venice was uh
[38:08] when the center of the world was
[38:10] shifting from Renaissance cities to
[38:13] Amsterdam for example or to the New
[38:15] World um and at exactly the same time in
[38:19] France we had uh uh so not in France in
[38:22] the European Parliament some French uh
[38:25] uh uh political leader uh Sak nafo gave
[38:29] quite a good speech uh um expressing the
[38:32] same ideas so you really see that like
[38:36] what uh uh Cal Lumis and Trump uh
[38:40] discussed and announced in the US is
[38:43] kind of uh triggering a lot of reactions
[38:46] and yeah it will be really really really
[38:49] uh I think fun to see uh and uh in
[38:53] 2025 and regarding uh like my Michael
[38:57] sailor the ETF and all that that stuff
[39:01] it has been commented a lot so I won't
[39:03] add anything quite new but I think first
[39:07] it will warm up a lot of different folks
[39:10] to the idea of a speculative attack um
[39:14] I've long uh tried to i' I spent quite
[39:17] some time Tred to guess who would be the
[39:20] next micro saor I've uh I'm leaning
[39:24] towards L lison and orle um
[39:28] um first because it's a company I know
[39:30] well because I work for them but also
[39:32] because it's one of the only large
[39:35] technological company in the world where
[39:38] the founders still have a lot of control
[39:41] uh on the company because he still
[39:44] almost majority sholder I think he owns
[39:46] like 40 41% of the company uh also the
[39:49] guy is crazy so it's is in the sense
[39:52] that he's able to think out of the box
[39:55] uh he's a mentor of Elon Musk so maybe
[39:57] there is something happening something
[39:59] will happen in the personal relationship
[40:01] here and um and Oracle is basically
[40:05] generating cash like few company are
[40:08] able to do it and they are always buying
[40:11] back their stocks they have been doing
[40:12] that for years and years and years uh
[40:15] only I think like I I calculated
[40:17] recently I think over like only the the
[40:20] like last three years they bought back
[40:22] uh um something like $80 billion of
[40:26] their own stock which is is a kind of
[40:28] ludicrous amount um and it's a company
[40:31] that also have little Avenue for
[40:33] investment to grow because
[40:36] uh in some sense they are R Seekers you
[40:39] know like they live on software that
[40:41] they have licensed uh uh decades ago and
[40:44] that it's like basically impossible to
[40:46] to to not use as a company and they are
[40:51] quite bad at competing with like other
[40:55] companies on different like line of
[40:56] product
[40:58] um and so yeah getting back to the ETF
[41:01] and stuff like that I think also like um
[41:05] I hope it warms uh uh some people up to
[41:08] the the dangers of uh centralized cion
[41:12] because as we speak like coinbase
[41:15] custody is uh holding the keys of
[41:17] something like 12 133% of all the
[41:22] Bitcoin uh uh uh Supply and I would um I
[41:29] I'm not quite comfortable with that like
[41:32] um it's not it's not me saying like what
[41:35] like ZF are bad like Michael sailor is
[41:38] bad and stuff like that um it's not me
[41:41] saying they should uh taking self
[41:43] custody because at the company level and
[41:46] when you are when you have the kind of
[41:48] mandate that you have when you are an
[41:50] asset manager issuing ETFs it's really
[41:53] difficult to do if not impossible but um
[41:57] at least um I think uh it should wake
[42:02] some people up to the importance of self
[42:05] custody which which is something really
[42:08] dear to us at Bull Bitcoin because at
[42:11] the end of the day if we understand that
[42:13] the purpose of Bitcoin is separating
[42:14] money from States um if we replay Gold's
[42:19] story through basically the 15th to 20th
[42:23] century meaning that uh for practical
[42:26] reasons we decide to give it to
[42:29] custodians uh because it's just easier
[42:31] for us then it could also became
[42:34] captured in some way shape or form maybe
[42:37] to not to the the same extent than gold
[42:40] was but it surely will and I can really
[42:44] see a kind of um like bad future uh and
[42:51] like a sad future in which like uh
[42:54] Bitcoin became adopted really really
[42:57] quickly uh by people just here to for
[43:01] the fat games and getting exposure
[43:04] through micro strategy ETFs and stuff
[43:07] like that thus increasing the Holdings
[43:09] of coinbase and then some like
[43:12] government institution stuff like that
[43:14] just like saying okay now you will
[43:16] create you will just create a settlement
[43:18] system centralized settlement system on
[43:21] on top of that you will give us access
[43:23] you will give us censorship rights and
[43:25] stuff like that and
[43:27] then like maybe some uh of us because we
[43:32] hold Bitcoin directly in self custody we
[43:34] know how to interact with the network to
[43:36] use it properly we can have some uh
[43:38] Financial sovereignty but uh for most of
[43:42] uh um the world population it won't be
[43:45] that way and in that scenario I think we
[43:50] failed interesting so like in that
[43:53] scenario you think uh Bitcoin will fail
[43:57] Bitcoin and also bitcoiners because um
[44:01] to it's only my opinion but to me it's
[44:04] our job also to um kind of warn about
[44:09] these kind of dangers
[44:12] and at the moment some of us are are
[44:15] speaking them their minds about it uh
[44:18] some more than others but the large
[44:21] majority of people describing themselves
[44:23] as bitcoiners are just cheering up for
[44:26] numbers go up
[44:27] um and I think that at the end of the
[44:31] day if the uh the dystopian scenario I
[44:34] described plays out uh we will have some
[44:37] part of
[44:39] responsibility um but I mean like it's
[44:43] not it's not a fatality of course uh
[44:46] many thing can change um but
[44:50] um maybe this will be understood the
[44:54] wrong way but in some sense um
[44:57] I will not cry if for
[45:00] example one of these institutions be
[45:04] micro strategy or ibits or Arc I don't
[45:08] care gets rug pull soon by coinbase like
[45:11] because it could like in in my
[45:15] experience people uh understand danger
[45:19] when they get hurt and just saying to
[45:22] people yeah it's kind of dangerous to
[45:25] create that
[45:27] such a
[45:28] Honeypot uh but once you get hacked or
[45:31] rped or stolen or censored out of your
[45:35] your Holdings or stuff like that it
[45:37] becomes way more practical and and
[45:39] obvious to you um so yeah could also
[45:43] change the way we think about this stuff
[45:47] interesting and also what you uh
[45:49] described earlier is super interesting
[45:52] kind of the kickoff of the global Game
[45:55] Theory um americ am I think uh probably
[45:59] moves really good now into Bitcoin let's
[46:01] see what Trump actually does um we have
[46:04] smaller States like bhan El Salvador um
[46:07] which is interesting to see but not as
[46:11] important uh of course because of the
[46:13] size as Europe or America moving in a
[46:17] big way but they're not moving that fast
[46:20] um now as you described
[46:24] the the the finance min minister of
[46:27] Germany that was the Finance Minister
[46:29] for the last four years yesterday
[46:32] literally was his last year last day of
[46:35] being a finance minister all of the
[46:37] sudden he he discovers Bitcoin and talks
[46:41] about Bitcoin uh he had now four years
[46:44] the chance as the finance minister of
[46:46] Germany to make something with Bitcoin
[46:48] and do something about it um but he but
[46:52] he didn't uh and also the 50k Bitcoin
[46:55] got sold I know it's not on a Germany
[46:58] level it was like a Saxony level so it
[47:01] was like on a smaller level but still uh
[47:04] I think the Finance Minister probably
[47:06] has some influence also there uh and now
[47:11] all of the sudden Bitcoin hits 100,000
[47:13] in Euros uh now all of a sudden he is no
[47:16] longer into office now he talks about
[47:19] Bitcoin H it's it's it's funny how how
[47:22] this works uh but yeah I I do have hope
[47:25] for for Europe uh to also kick off the
[47:28] global Game Theory uh because I would
[47:31] like for Europe to have a lot of Bitcoin
[47:33] and not just Russia uee America like
[47:37] Europe should not completely
[47:39] sleep on on that on that Trend and uh I
[47:45] yeah I excuse me I agree with you with
[47:48] some caveat like I'm more interested in
[47:51] European plebs getting Bitcoin whereas
[47:56] um what what's happening right now is
[47:58] that like our political leaders are fing
[48:00] and starting to understand that they
[48:02] will be left behind if they don't wake
[48:04] up uh but I don't see that quite uh in
[48:09] the general
[48:10] population uhe at least in France in my
[48:13] home country I don't know how the
[48:15] situation is in different European
[48:18] countries uh and I think like there is a
[48:23] case to be made that uh like coin is
[48:27] like open to everyone something like uh
[48:31] it levels the playing field between like
[48:33] individuals and and structures of power
[48:36] and So like um it would be better in my
[48:40] mind if um there are like many
[48:44] individual and Corporation holding
[48:47] Bitcoin uh when we reach the point where
[48:50] uh country are really uh stockpiling
[48:55] Bitcoin for strategical reserves and
[48:57] stuff like that yeah absolutely and uh
[49:00] actually what a small small tweet about
[49:03] that the other day when micro strategy
[49:06] didn't buy uh the Bitcoin and I
[49:09] basically said like oh it's good news we
[49:11] we we want to have Bitcoin and not the
[49:13] uh big corporations they they don't need
[49:16] Bitcoin and in the same sense is a good
[49:18] news of uh Germany selling the Bitcoin
[49:22] and not holding on to them um the one
[49:25] thing I will say about that is
[49:27] it it shows a little bit of what the
[49:31] overall adoption rate is how politicians
[49:34] St talk to certain extent um not always
[49:39] uh and Canada is probably also a good
[49:41] example where politicians are really not
[49:44] liking uh um Bitcoin but there's there's
[49:49] a I think there's a shift coming in in
[49:50] Canada especially the next next year it
[49:53] it depends if you look for example PV
[49:56] yeah has uh spoken highly about Bitcoin
[49:59] in the past uh he seems to get it at
[50:03] least to some extent um so yeah things
[50:06] may might change and also I would add
[50:10] like I think there is some uh overlooked
[50:13] quite overlooked region in the world
[50:15] where um the line will shift uh in a big
[50:20] way over the the the rest of the decade
[50:24] which is the whole axis uh between
[50:28] basically Istanbul and Jakarta so the
[50:33] Indian Ocean like India Indonesia the
[50:36] south of China uh the Middle East
[50:40] aaban uh all these countries like they
[50:44] have like on average like 10% growth
[50:47] they are like creating a new middle
[50:50] class uh in about 10 years they they
[50:53] will uh have the kind of the the the the
[50:57] the same purchasing power as uh some
[51:00] small Western uh uh economies
[51:04] and the fact is that financial
[51:06] institutions there are really bad that
[51:09] people have a culture of not relying on
[51:11] government because uh of their past
[51:14] experience and so and they all have
[51:18] smartphones they all they are all eager
[51:20] to adopt new technology um and they they
[51:23] are not like work like they they they
[51:26] really we are driven towards like uh the
[51:30] kind of materialism that we had like
[51:33] couple of decades in Europe where they
[51:35] want like a better way of life a better
[51:39] fin Financial standing better material
[51:42] conditions for their family and stuff
[51:44] like that so I could also make the case
[51:46] that a lot of uh um adoption on the
[51:50] ground will happen there and also I
[51:52] should have mentioned that at the
[51:54] beginning we are talking four billion
[51:56] people
[51:57] um so uh in terms of like getting
[52:01] Bitcoin in the hands of people uh I
[52:05] think that's the most untapped uh uh um
[52:08] uh um uh reservoir of potential plebs uh
[52:13] especially also because most of these
[52:17] most of the national currencies in those
[52:19] countries are terrible if you look at
[52:21] Turkey for example I think there are
[52:24] many bitcoiners there and most stat
[52:26] statistics show that which can also
[52:29] really easily be explained by the fact
[52:32] that the the Turkish L excuse me is one
[52:35] of the the biggest cheit coin out there
[52:38] and there are already a lot of mechanism
[52:40] for financial reparation in jky uh which
[52:43] is to me the best environment possible
[52:46] if you want your population to adopt
[52:48] Bitcoin because uh it's just outline its
[52:52] value interesting is is 2024 kind of the
[52:55] start
[52:57] for uh the official start of global game
[52:59] theory for nation state adoption uh do
[53:01] you do you see that like that
[53:05] um yeah maybe um maybe also it all
[53:08] depends on the US because all we are
[53:10] discussing uh starts there it's like
[53:13] this kind of uh domino effect of Lumis
[53:17] and Trump getting together and saying
[53:18] yeah we will do that uh what happens if
[53:21] they don't do it what happens if they do
[53:25] it but
[53:27] I mean it's the government you know like
[53:30] if for example they do it like let's say
[53:32] they buy like one million coin at they
[53:34] they said they as they
[53:37] propose in the law uh over the next 18
[53:41] months then they get a financial crisis
[53:44] for some reason and they decide to sell
[53:46] it all to rescue financial institution
[53:49] to pay the debt to do whatever
[53:51] politician are always doing uh I mean
[53:55] what happens with like uh the country
[53:58] that have fod with them will they line
[54:01] and also sell what what will they do I
[54:03] don't know uh and I think like it's it's
[54:07] it's like game theory is dynamic you
[54:10] know like uh you could also like imagine
[54:14] that if for example like all the West uh
[54:18] follow suit with the us and that for
[54:21] example like a large chunk of the
[54:23] Bitcoin Supply uh ends up in the ends of
[54:28] like uh uh Western ETFs Corporation such
[54:32] as micro strategy and sine state in the
[54:35] west how the East will react as we
[54:37] mentioned at the beginning um we are
[54:41] gearing up toward a different world
[54:43] order um
[54:45] with I think an obvious break from uh
[54:49] the the the world we we used to live in
[54:54] especially with the bricks forming their
[54:56] own Camp uh how will they react uh in
[55:00] this scenario and also like they have
[55:04] spend they have been spending like 20
[55:06] years to try to get out of the dollar uh
[55:09] of the US dollar and doing like Summit
[55:12] of summit of summit discussing like yeah
[55:14] let's use Yuan let's use rimbi let's use
[55:17] rupe but at the end of the day they are
[55:19] just like rediscovering the the problem
[55:22] of double coincidence of want uh because
[55:25] they are essentially proposing using
[55:28] like um some money so debt from oine to
[55:33] clear Deb with another sine which I mean
[55:37] like the Indians will never accept using
[55:39] Chinese money um so for example but you
[55:43] could you could use many different
[55:45] examples um if they try to settle in
[55:47] Gold it will be logistical nightmare to
[55:50] just do clearance in Gold uh and uh in
[55:53] the same way then uh the Indians won't
[55:56] accept using Yuan they won't never trust
[55:59] they will never trust the sh the Chinese
[56:02] uh uh for like gold certificates or or
[56:06] or or to to just believe that the gold
[56:08] is indeed there um so maybe there are
[56:13] they have more reasons than Western
[56:16] countries to use Bitcoin as uh an
[56:21] instrument for international trade and
[56:23] then you also have the idea
[56:27] that the way our supply chains are right
[56:30] now for all the talks about fren shuring
[56:33] and stuff like that we still need some
[56:36] trade between the East and the west and
[56:39] how will they uh exchange value like
[56:44] through the US dollar in Swift I don't
[56:46] see the Russian doing that anymore
[56:48] neither will the Chinese maybe the
[56:51] Indians because they play on both fronts
[56:54] but uh I think like if like some like
[56:59] French Corporation for example needs to
[57:01] trade with like China or Iran or Brazil
[57:05] or I don't know or Russia or Bitcoin is
[57:08] the best tool to do that and I think uh
[57:13] that would be even more bullish if we
[57:16] kind of if we we start seeing this kind
[57:19] of stuff it will be even more bullish
[57:21] than a um National strategic Reserve in
[57:25] the USA for example
[57:27] interesting what what what do you think
[57:29] will has to happen
[57:31] the that the Fiat system is kind of
[57:34] bending the knee to bitcoin right now I
[57:38] would say the field system is still like
[57:41] in control of everything uh and Bitcoin
[57:43] is just poking small holes into that
[57:46] that system uh what do you think has to
[57:49] happen that the field system kind of is
[57:53] is going to its inevitable uh CR
[57:56] or do you see feeld system managing over
[57:59] over long per obviously we we talk about
[58:02] long periods of times here but uh what
[58:05] has to happen what events are you
[58:06] looking at that that could trigger that
[58:09] so first I think we are really closer
[58:12] than what to to IT hand than what what
[58:16] most people think um let's take the Euro
[58:20] for example uh as we speak now uh my
[58:24] home country friend uh present presents
[58:26] with 6 to 7% deficits this is like
[58:31] completely crazy like it's almost
[58:33] unheard of uh uh from uh oecd country
[58:38] outside of a sovereign default like uh
[58:42] it's the kind of level you had in Greece
[58:45] and Spain during the the the the debt
[58:49] crisis in 2010
[58:51] 2012 um
[58:54] currently we we we don't have a
[58:57] government uh like uh president Macon
[59:01] appointed like um a prime minister uh
[59:06] two months ago something like that even
[59:08] less uh it was uh it received a vote of
[59:11] no confidence from the parliament now we
[59:14] have another one which is uh not really
[59:17] popular this is like an old school
[59:20] politician that like get there through
[59:23] inera because there is basically nobody
[59:26] so here at home we we see that our
[59:31] economy is collapsing we have like we
[59:33] have hit we just hit a record in
[59:36] bankruptcy our debt is out of control we
[59:39] have like uh uh the government expedit
[59:43] in the GDP are 60% of the GDP so it's
[59:46] the same level as in the USSR in the 70s
[59:50] which is kind of crazy uh I think it's
[59:52] something like 40% for of the working
[59:56] age population that is working for the
[59:57] government um we don't have energy
[60:00] security uh um um and we like the cost
[60:05] of servicing the debt is getting out of
[60:07] control uh public services are
[60:09] collapsing like everything is like
[60:13] following the you know the gradually
[60:15] then suddenly pattern like I I I
[60:19] explained uh in in an article like six
[60:22] months ago that uh we will will have
[60:27] this kind of sequence of event of course
[60:29] I didn't uh uh forecast it that
[60:32] precisely precisely but um I was still
[60:36] able and it's not my job you know I was
[60:38] still able to say okay so we are in that
[60:41] so it's uh the debt holder that will do
[60:44] that will uh decide our politics it's
[60:46] it's like you can go to the to you can
[60:49] you can vote now if you want but it
[60:51] won't change anything um we have no
[60:56] painless way out of this financial
[60:58] situation and stuff like that and I mean
[61:02] currently the situation just to explain
[61:04] to your audience is like France has
[61:06] decided to live uh Beyond its means for
[61:09] ideological reason and we are footing
[61:11] the bills to European other European
[61:14] countries that are uh less ill managed
[61:17] uh because of the common currency uh I
[61:20] don't see uh like the Germans or the
[61:24] Dutch uh uh access accepting that for
[61:26] too long uh I don't see a painless way
[61:31] out of this crisis for France and so I
[61:34] could make the case that like in three
[61:36] years time the Euro will be past history
[61:39] what happens to financial markets what
[61:41] happens to our economy what happens to
[61:43] fats what happens to do do we get back
[61:46] to National monies if like we were to
[61:49] reintroduce a French national uh money
[61:52] now it would have like something like
[61:55] maybe 15 % inflation due to our our
[61:58] situation uh what how the population
[62:00] will react will they still ignore
[62:02] Bitcoin I don't think so how the state
[62:05] will react they will uh Go full steam
[62:08] with financial reparation Capital
[62:10] controls and stuff like that obviously
[62:12] they will see savings pension plans and
[62:15] stuff like that so uh if you look at uh
[62:19] past examples of failing countries
[62:21] hyperinflation Sovereign default and
[62:23] stuff like that it's always the same
[62:25] thing gradually than suddenly and most
[62:28] people they don't understand it uh
[62:31] before it's too late and so I think that
[62:35] um the kind of uh the game theory we are
[62:39] talking about is more like we are in the
[62:42] accelerating phase where the fiscal
[62:45] situation in the west especially and
[62:48] also in China is so dire like we have so
[62:52] much debt and so little real
[62:55] productivity and we have been in this
[62:57] situation for decades now that we cannot
[63:00] just kick the can down the road without
[63:04] implementing real uh um drastic measures
[63:08] uh and I mean like kind of almost
[63:10] totalitarian measure whereby you don't
[63:13] have any Financial uh uh Liberties
[63:17] anymore and so uh in this context um I
[63:23] think Bitcoin is a tremendous uh uh exit
[63:29] uh uh option it's like um like we as
[63:34] bitcoiners we understand that already
[63:37] but I could definitely see uh like
[63:41] adoption just Pi against team in Europe
[63:43] because of the macroeconomic situation I
[63:45] just described you know is is it a good
[63:49] idea to fle when I when I hear that I
[63:52] really get scared of Europe and the
[63:54] situation that that is kind of evolving
[63:58] um should we flee Europe like as as
[64:01] Bitcoin as is that something that you're
[64:04] like oh maybe it gets uh um B bad for us
[64:09] bitcoiners if the Euro crashes and
[64:11] Bitcoin Rises massively uh government
[64:15] has to get money somewhere I mean
[64:16] Bitcoin is probably the hardest place to
[64:18] to get money out it's probably easier to
[64:20] get it out of houses and real estate
[64:22] taxes and and and Pension funds and all
[64:26] those things uh but but are you afraid
[64:29] of of of being living in Europe as you
[64:31] live in France not really and I would
[64:33] say to answer your previous question it
[64:35] depends on your situation uh if you are
[64:39] married you have kids and stuff like
[64:41] that which is not my case um yeah maybe
[64:44] leing is a good idea because anyway like
[64:49] like even if things gets better uh it
[64:52] will have to get way worse before
[64:56] um and so I don't I'm not sure it's like
[65:00] the best thing currently for example to
[65:03] raise the child in France uh just look
[65:05] at our educational system like it has
[65:09] becoming a machine for uh uh churning
[65:12] out like morons uh uh totally
[65:16] ideologically brainwashed by like work
[65:19] culture and neomarxism
[65:21] um if you are young uh and you can like
[65:26] uh experience Financial sovereignty
[65:29] because you know how to hold and use
[65:31] Bitcoin um uh in
[65:35] Europe um my advice would be to stay and
[65:38] fight because at the end of the day um
[65:42] it's not only just saying like Okay
[65:44] let's adopt Bitcoin and stuff will fix
[65:47] themselves um there also is a need for
[65:52] education for different propos positions
[65:56] for um um like uh new forms of
[66:01] institutions of governance uh and also
[66:05] we need like social bombs at the local
[66:08] levels and stuff like that so if to to
[66:12] get uh to use a popular uh uh phrase uh
[66:16] if we want to build Europe back better
[66:19] we need talent uh uh here also but um if
[66:24] you want to like thrive in a collapsing
[66:29] Europe you will need like the kind of
[66:32] resiliency that you could only have in
[66:36] certain like social economical work
[66:38] settings and of course Bitcoin helps
[66:42] tremendously in that way uh because it
[66:44] will help you dodge some of the worst uh
[66:48] flavor of financial reparation I
[66:50] described it will also give you a peace
[66:53] of mind that you will uh need to avoid
[66:56] like uh getting like um trapped in the
[67:00] old like political discourse and stuff
[67:03] like that like people around me um they
[67:07] are all expecting like a savior you know
[67:10] like they are all expecting a political
[67:13] figure emerging in France and uh
[67:16] cleaning up the country such as mle is
[67:19] trying to do in
[67:21] Argentina um I don't think it's a good
[67:25] idea to be expecting we should try to do
[67:29] uh what we can at our own level which
[67:33] for some will be huge which for others
[67:36] will be small but um everything is
[67:39] needed and in in the same way I think
[67:44] like there is some Merit in just like
[67:49] being here uh in the trenches to uh try
[67:53] to save as many people that want to be
[67:56] safe because some they just don't want
[67:58] uh and so we will still need like
[68:01] Bitcoin podcast we will still need like
[68:04] companies such as bull Bitcoin to give a
[68:06] a gateway to people uh uh we will also
[68:10] need like um uh tools we will need uh um
[68:15] people like teaching basic stuff uh uh
[68:18] to help like new Commerce uh
[68:21] understanding the situation and
[68:23] understand how they can contribute to to
[68:26] to just make the situation better and
[68:29] like we need all of that so um I don't I
[68:33] I won't I wouldn't say that like leaving
[68:35] is automatic but um I I would definitely
[68:39] like uh encourage some people to
[68:42] consider it
[68:45] because you don't owe anything to your
[68:48] State uh even if you are like really for
[68:53] example I I I'm I I really feel like I'm
[68:56] French you know I really like my culture
[68:58] I really like my country uh I I don't
[69:01] see myself living elsewhere I like the
[69:03] food here I like everything um that's
[69:07] why my thinking is more like just like
[69:10] let's get rid of the parasite and the
[69:12] government but um apart from that uh you
[69:17] don't owe anything to the French State
[69:19] you know like you don't have to to stay
[69:22] here and and just Finance their
[69:26] and and and suffer from from their
[69:28] policies uh you you can definitely like
[69:31] go to a country that will respect your
[69:34] natural rights uh more and and develop
[69:38] your life there and and just be happy
[69:41] like it's your only uh how to to say it
[69:45] in English your your only like Duty as a
[69:47] human being is just
[69:50] that that's a beautiful way to look at
[69:52] it it's a beautiful way of like uh um
[69:55] like you should leave if if you really
[70:00] want to and if you like maybe also have
[70:02] kids especially if you raise kids here
[70:04] and stuff like that but yeah um there's
[70:07] also something to it of fighting for
[70:09] your country of like trying to uh save
[70:13] the people of of Europe and not Europe
[70:16] itself like save the people here um I
[70:19] like that a lot that's that's very cool
[70:21] really cool do you know do you know the
[70:23] addiction of Europe
[70:26] the the what the Abduction of Europe
[70:29] abduction I don't know the word
[70:30] abduction abduction uh it's like
[70:33] kidnapping oh no no no so it's a
[70:37] painting by
[70:38] rbr um it's originally it's it's uh from
[70:43] Greek mythology it's a myth uh from
[70:46] which the the name Europa of our
[70:48] continent come from and basically um
[70:52] it's this uh Phoenician Beauty called
[70:56] Europa um that Enchanted Zeus the king
[71:00] of the Greek gods and to try to seduce
[71:03] her in it transformed into a magnificent
[71:07] Bull and came down to fenicia and lured
[71:10] her into climbing on her back and then
[71:14] he brought her to Creed um um where he
[71:18] was uh like in Greece you know um and
[71:23] it's it's like for example to us it's a
[71:26] powerful myth of course for bull Bitcoin
[71:29] coming into Europe because uh it's
[71:32] exactly that like um you know we just
[71:35] want to like have the the
[71:40] the like have bu Bitcoin coming into
[71:43] Europe in order to give the means to
[71:47] people that want to um restore Europe
[71:50] back to its glory to just do that
[71:53] starting from their own uh individual
[71:55] life and self um and we need people to
[71:59] do that but
[72:02] we I I
[72:03] mean for many people it will be just
[72:06] better to leave uh and to build uh uh to
[72:12] build their life elsewhere uh in a
[72:14] better setting I love that really cool
[72:17] um we have one question that I asked
[72:20] each and every one of my guests and the
[72:22] question is what can we learn from you
[72:24] besid it's
[72:26] Bitcoin
[72:28] H wow um complicated question uh let me
[72:33] think um I have an article I've been um
[72:38] working on for quite some time now uh
[72:41] but with all that's going on with bull
[72:44] Bitcoin uh I
[72:46] don't have had I hadn't the time to
[72:50] finish it sooner but I will publish it
[72:52] soon I think um and basically it's kind
[72:56] of a long article um but if I try to
[73:01] break it down basically um it's uh an
[73:05] overall critique of the efficient Mark
[73:09] um the efficient market hypothesis which
[73:12] is one of the building blocks of modern
[73:17] Financial thoughts as it is developed in
[73:20] Academia and taught in universities and
[73:24] used in financial models on Wall Street
[73:26] and stuff like that and as bitcoiners we
[73:29] have done tremendous work to um
[73:33] criticize methodically
[73:36] methodologically uh kesian ISM and
[73:39] Marxism and different uh economic sorts
[73:43] and as we mentioned at the beginning of
[73:45] this interview um once we get to
[73:48] hyperbitcoinization we will have to
[73:50] build a new Financial system on top of
[73:53] Bitcoin as money and I think um if we
[73:57] build it uh with the principles of
[74:01] modern Financial theory in mind modern
[74:04] Financial theory is a whole like set of
[74:07] um Financial knowledge let's say uh um
[74:12] that is built on the EMH the efficient
[74:15] market hypothesis and basically um if we
[74:20] we we build upon that um framework work
[74:25] it will be totally dysfunctional because
[74:28] this theory is I would say at least as
[74:33] stupid as
[74:34] kism uh and basically what it says like
[74:37] it holds that market gations like
[74:41] volatility in financial markets is the
[74:44] products of uh like homoeconomicus you
[74:47] know like this kind of uh um utility
[74:50] discounting machine that you find in
[74:52] economic mainstream economic textbooks
[74:55] always reassessing
[74:58] the fundamental value of Securities in
[75:02] the light of new information that is
[75:05] eting the market and so to them it means
[75:09] that markets are linear systems only
[75:12] moved always in equilibrium and then
[75:15] moved out of equilibrium by um uh like
[75:19] rational agents uh using new information
[75:23] to um uh gauge uh the value of financial
[75:27] securities uh and the consequence of
[75:30] that is that markets are random so
[75:34] that's for example like um volatility in
[75:38] Bitcoin tomorrow is Independence than
[75:41] volatility in Bitcoin today and of
[75:44] yesterday's
[75:45] volatility uh which is another way to
[75:48] say that uh financial markets have no
[75:51] memory um so a lot of a lot of things to
[75:55] unpack here but uh all these hypothesis
[75:59] uh uh and all these results um basically
[76:03] can be criticized both from an empirical
[76:06] and statistic statistical standpoint but
[76:09] also from a logical standpoint and there
[76:12] are like um on the the outskirts of
[76:16] Academia let's say there are like
[76:19] researchers using different mathematical
[76:21] tools different hypothesis trying to
[76:24] explain how financial markets behave
[76:27] using uh um tools mostly streaming from
[76:31] physics um and it's it's some stuff that
[76:35] are really not well known maybe as was
[76:39] like Australian economics two decades
[76:41] ago for most um economic students uh but
[76:46] I think these tools are way better um to
[76:50] make financial decision basically
[76:52] because they are built upon uh way
[76:56] better understanding of what financial
[76:59] markets are and how they behave um and
[77:03] so yeah maybe that is something uh that
[77:06] could interest folks into Bitcoin and
[77:10] that they could discover by reading this
[77:12] article I don't think it's something
[77:15] they would uh find uh elsewhere unless
[77:18] they are used to read like um uh like
[77:22] Financial research papers and stuff like
[77:25] that that's super interesting uh please
[77:28] please when it's out please send it to
[77:30] me I think that could be an interesting
[77:32] article uh yeah thank you so much F on
[77:35] uh for for sharing that with us we have
[77:37] an end routine in the podcast uh where
[77:40] the previous guest is asking a question
[77:42] for the next guest without knowing who
[77:44] the next guest actually is and your
[77:46] question from the previous guest is if
[77:48] you were tasked with creating a Bitcoin
[77:51] security checklist for someone just
[77:53] entering the space what what are the
[77:55] three most important things that someone
[77:57] has to do wow it's a really good
[78:01] question um three things security
[78:05] checklist
[78:07] so obviously the first will be like just
[78:11] get a hardware wallet um like a battle
[78:15] tested one um at Bull Bitcoin we have a
[78:18] preference for cold card but I know it's
[78:20] not uh that uh uh frequent in Europe I
[78:25] also really like bitbox I think like the
[78:27] the user experience is really cool um I
[78:31] mean some of Ledger products are also
[78:34] nice uh although I would advise against
[78:38] using them in conjunction with Ledger
[78:41] live um which to me is not a good piece
[78:44] of software um also maybe if you never
[78:49] used it try power um if you want to like
[78:54] have a desktop wallet that is like
[78:57] really um secure and also like really
[79:00] flexible in the sense that it allows you
[79:03] to really see what you are doing in
[79:06] terms of interaction with the Bitcoin uh
[79:08] Network um I think it's a really amazing
[79:12] piece of software and um in conjunction
[79:16] with a good Hardware wallet it's one of
[79:18] the best setup you can have um and so
[79:23] that's two
[79:25] um and I think maybe in terms of
[79:32] um maybe in terms of uh security more
[79:36] generally speaking I think uh it's a
[79:40] good idea to uh try to redevelop um uh
[79:46] relationships whether it is with uh
[79:49] other plebs or with your local
[79:51] communities because um
[79:55] if it's a fan uh that's where your
[79:59] food Security will come from for example
[80:02] that's where uh many other kind of
[80:04] security could come from um so yeah I
[80:08] would say get a hardware wallet um and
[80:12] if you don't know how to use it which
[80:15] one to choose uh you can always go to
[80:18] Bull Bitcoin one of the thing we do is
[80:20] like free education um TR power it's the
[80:25] best desktop uh Bitcoin wallet out there
[80:29] uh and I think uh like like your first
[80:33] experience with it can be a little bit
[80:35] uh difficult because um it's not really
[80:39] user friendly for noobs but um it's also
[80:43] like it also all the functionality you
[80:46] want and it doesn't compromise on
[80:48] security and privacy and stuff like that
[80:51] and because it's really descriptive you
[80:53] can also
[80:55] understand better how Bitcoin works the
[80:57] different scripts we have in Bitcoin the
[81:00] different transaction formats what are
[81:02] you Tak
[81:03] exos why it is important to consolidate
[81:06] you takos and stuff like that and yeah
[81:09] last piece of advice uh just like try
[81:12] create like good social relationships
[81:15] with uh people that you know you will
[81:17] spend most of your life with because uh
[81:20] in my opinion most of our uh security
[81:23] and generally speaking quality of life
[81:25] comes through
[81:27] that I love that really cool thank you
[81:29] so much uh f um before I let you go
[81:33] where can people find you ask your
[81:34] questions and and reach out to you so

[82:04] the platform with anything that uh you
[82:07] need to uh have a good Bitcoin Journey
[82:10] uh don't hesitate to use our chats uh
[82:12] there is always a new man behind with
[82:15] deep Bitcoin knowledge that can answer
[82:17] your question um and yeah generally
[82:20] speaking you can also uh follow us on
[82:23] our different uh social media account um
[82:26] so ADB Bitcoin uncore or ADB Bitcoin F
