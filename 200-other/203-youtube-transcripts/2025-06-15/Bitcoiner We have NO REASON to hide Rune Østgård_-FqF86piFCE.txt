[00:00] we need to come out strong and uh yeah
[00:02] be proud of what we are if you have
[00:05] adopted these values and and you
[00:07] understand Bitcoin you have a good
[00:10] understanding of the Bitcoin social
[00:12] layer and the economics of Bitcoin and
[00:14] the economics of of fat then you are a
[00:17] resource in society and you shouldn't
[00:19] hide if we didn't have Bitcoin it could
[00:22] have become very ugly Bitcoin is is the
[00:24] perfect tool that can help us to to
[00:27] reclaim a monetary Freedom they zero is
[00:30] the belief system and layer one is is
[00:32] the monetary system everything else in
[00:35] in society will develop in very
[00:37] different ways depending on what kind of
[00:39] monetary system and belief system you
[00:42] have seems like there's a really long
[00:44] history of inflation um can you like
[00:47] maybe explain a little bit like what's
[00:49] the what's the history there and in your
[00:51] book of about fraud coin yeah okay so
[00:54] the book is named the fraud coin 1,000
[00:57] years of inflation as a policy and the
[01:00] 1,000 years is the approximate time that
[01:03] we have
[01:04] had a monopoly in money Creation in
[01:08] Norway since uh 150 after Christ
[01:12] so that was just before the end of the
[01:16] Viking age actually so my U my um
[01:22] motivation for writing the book was to
[01:24] explain what inflation is and what
[01:27] monetary policies and how it has
[01:29] developed to um an average reader not to
[01:33] the economists um not to the historians
[01:36] uh and
[01:38] U my thesis was that it was easier for
[01:42] for people to understand what it's all
[01:44] about if you include um yeah real people
[01:48] and uh Real historic events uh so it it
[01:52] makes it so much more accessible for for
[01:55] for the average reader I think in the
[01:59] beginning it was supposed just to be a
[02:00] short article uh and then uh as as the
[02:05] time went by it became a whole book and
[02:09] um the history of inflation as a policy
[02:13] or uh By You Know by with with
[02:18] politicians or rulers who who inflate
[02:21] the money supply that goes back to uh at
[02:25] least um the ancient Athens around
[02:31] 430 years before Christ was born and uh
[02:36] it has developed gradually from uh yeah
[02:40] inflating the money supply using silver
[02:42] and gold coins uh to to using paper and
[02:47] then digital money in our day and age so
[02:51] I just track the events there with u
[02:55] trying to have a sort of a holistic
[02:57] approach there and uh explain events not
[03:00] only in uh in Norway of course but but
[03:03] in in the rest of the world as well and
[03:06] yeah try to explain how the interplay
[03:10] between the different countries for
[03:12] instance the country that has the
[03:13] reserve currency which at the moment is
[03:16] United State States and and the smaller
[03:19] countries so I use Norway as an example
[03:22] there to to to show how the Dynamics
[03:25] play out over time U when you have a
[03:29] sort of a a ruling country like United
[03:32] States and and a yeah you can call it a
[03:35] client State like Norway in in terms of
[03:38] monetary policy and also in terms of of
[03:40] course other other areas in in
[03:44] politics um I think about
[03:47] uh about a third of the book or
[03:50] something like that is uh describes
[03:53] historical events uh up to
[03:58] yeah let
[04:00] say the
[04:02] 19 1970s when we left the the last gold
[04:09] standard and then uh yeah it's a it's an
[04:13] a book that analyzes things in a very
[04:16] sort of accessible way as as well so and
[04:20] draw some conclusions and uh
[04:24] my my proposal to towards the end of the
[04:28] book is that we must return turn to what
[04:30] I call monetary free Freedom which
[04:34] basically is the right to use the money
[04:36] you like best and that is a sort of a
[04:39] foundational principle in
[04:41] Civilization that's the way you get um
[04:45] all the other types of freedoms as well
[04:48] in my opinion and uh that's the way you
[04:51] you get a society that uh where
[04:53] everybody can prosper and and live a
[04:55] good life so so monetary freedom is a
[04:59] very important topic in the book yeah
[05:02] and it's it's it's what what I always
[05:04] say because some people I don't like the
[05:07] the altcoins I like don't this but I'm
[05:08] like let's just allow everything and
[05:11] let's let's let let's have the free
[05:12] market to decide what what money is best
[05:14] for the people and I think in any free
[05:16] market Bitcoin at least from now will
[05:18] will win uh and and probably also like
[05:21] long time in the future um the question
[05:24] I ask myself now is like is this when we
[05:27] have such a long history of inflation
[05:29] and and the elites and governments and
[05:31] whatever you want to call it um always
[05:34] try to exploit that that power is that
[05:37] ever stopping is like is there a chance
[05:40] that that that will ever stop or are
[05:42] there historical events or historical
[05:44] epochs where we can where we went from
[05:48] inflationary like really a lot of
[05:51] inflation to like back to
[05:53] deflationary uh or like even like other
[05:56] other states is there like something we
[05:57] can compare uh the history of to what we
[06:01] have now or what we might have in the
[06:03] future yes definitely and I think it's
[06:05] important to notice that uh monetary
[06:09] Freedom which is the absence of monetary
[06:12] policy has been sort of the
[06:14] guiding principle or the principle in
[06:17] terms of how we deal with money
[06:20] throughout the most of the
[06:23] civilizations history so we have had
[06:25] Civilizations for at least 5,000 years
[06:28] and although
[06:30] we we know that there has been many
[06:33] regulations of of which money you can
[06:36] use and attempts at
[06:40] monopolizing uh the use of money we we
[06:43] also know that um the first uh
[06:47] information or the oldest information we
[06:50] have about uh uh using inflation as a
[06:53] policy by by multi by expanding the
[06:57] money supply is it's just 2,400 years uh
[07:02] ago in in Athens as I said previously
[07:05] and after that it has been sort of a a
[07:09] gradual development where where the
[07:12] inflation policy spread from country to
[07:15] Country probably because it fueled um
[07:19] several Wars conflicts between states
[07:22] and city states and nation states and
[07:26] yeah so so INF infation as a policy
[07:31] always leads to con conflicts and that's
[07:33] uh most likely how how it spread
[07:36] throughout
[07:37] um the world but then we know that for
[07:41] instance in Norway we managed to protect
[07:44] uh a monetary Freedom until 150 and that
[07:48] is less than thousand years ago and U uh
[07:53] Denmark had it a few uh years more
[07:56] probably and uh I've been told now that
[07:59] uh Sweden had it until I think it was
[08:04] the 12th or the 13th century and also I
[08:07] had a podcast recording now with some
[08:10] Icelandic Bitcoin friends um and they
[08:14] told me that they had the monetary
[08:16] Freedom until in the 13th century and we
[08:21] also uh have quite strong indications of
[08:27] Ireland having monetary freedom until
[08:30] the beginning of the 17th
[08:33] century uh and if we if we talk about
[08:35] countries that uh sort of where where
[08:39] the people reclaimed their monetary
[08:41] Freedom then we can for instance mention
[08:45] the Netherlands in the period after the
[08:48] Rebellion against the hubs borgs Empire
[08:51] in
[08:52] 1566 so they probably kept the principle
[08:55] of monetary Freedom uh during what was
[08:59] called the Dutch Golden Age which lasted
[09:02] uh for about 150
[09:05] years uh it was probably very very
[09:08] important um uh expl part a very
[09:11] important part of the explanation why
[09:13] they actually had a a golden age in the
[09:17] Netherlands and then we also know that
[09:21] um uh After the revolution in the United
[09:26] States which um came to an end in
[09:30] 1783 we know that Americans uh United
[09:34] States they had the monetary Freedom as
[09:37] a de facto principle at least until
[09:41] 1857 with the uh introduction of the
[09:44] coinage ACT which uh basically said that
[09:48] uh from from from I don't know if it was
[09:51] from 1857 or if it came into effect
[09:55] later but uh sometimes after um 19
[10:00] 57 um foreign coins weren't what we call
[10:04] legal tender anymore so uh you only had
[10:09] American coins as legal tender but it it
[10:12] continued with with with uh with freeuse
[10:15] of Bank currencies so the banks uh they
[10:19] weren't um coordinated by a central bank
[10:23] in the United States before 1914 when we
[10:27] got the the Federal Reserve curve so you
[10:31] had sort of competing Bank
[10:33] currencies uh until
[10:36] 1914 so that's uh um that gives at least
[10:40] a some degree of monetary Freedom
[10:43] although the the American silver coins
[10:47] were uh and probably gold coins as well
[10:50] I guess uh had a sort of a privilege uh
[10:54] privilege status from the coinage act of
[10:57] U 1850 7 and then we should also mention
[11:02] Argentina which uh had their Uprising
[11:06] against the Spanish in
[11:08] 1816 and they um they uh had monetary
[11:13] freedom in the period afterwards so they
[11:15] used um currencies and coins from uh
[11:19] other countries in in addition to the
[11:22] fact that they also had Free banking so
[11:24] the different Argentinian Banks they
[11:27] issued their own currencies and compete
[11:30] with with their own currencies and um
[11:34] from what I understand they they kept
[11:38] this as
[11:40] a yeah as a the
[11:43] facto
[11:45] um what what can you say said the facto
[11:48] principle at least until the beginning
[11:50] or well into actually the 20th century I
[11:54] don't know if it was in the 1920s or
[11:57] 1910 or something like that so so and
[12:00] that's that's very interesting because
[12:03] you know Javier M uh who is the new
[12:07] president as of uh
[12:10] 2023 he has been talking about uh going
[12:13] back to monetary Freedom First via
[12:18] dollarization of of the economy in
[12:20] Argentina and uh I think he understands
[12:24] this history very well because he he
[12:26] talks a lot uh also about the extreme
[12:30] growth levels they they had in Argentina
[12:32] in the especially in the 19th
[12:35] century so so although we might say that
[12:40] it's it's more than a hundred years ago
[12:44] since we have had any major countries
[12:47] with the monetary Freedom it's quite
[12:49] recent it's just four four generations
[12:52] uh back in back in history so um
[12:57] and what what what can we learn from
[13:00] from those periods where monetary
[13:04] Freedom was
[13:06] um reintroduced in society well we know
[13:10] that the growth in the United States and
[13:13] Argentina it was phenomenal and um
[13:17] although many people uh argue many
[13:21] people say that this was because of the
[13:23] gold standard the gold standard was
[13:25] introduced in
[13:26] 1870s many people
[13:29] talk about
[13:31] the uh the reason why we had so much
[13:36] prosperity in the 19th century and um
[13:40] yeah the econ Economic Development was
[13:42] very fast in especially in the United
[13:46] States and they often refer to the gold
[13:49] standard as an
[13:50] explanation but the way I see it the
[13:54] combination of Argentina and the United
[13:58] States having mon Terr freedom for for
[14:00] most of the time until yeah gradually
[14:04] less and less of course in the until the
[14:07] beginning of the 20th century I think
[14:09] that's a far better explanation actually
[14:12] um and um what we also what I also
[14:17] perhaps mentioned was that this is just
[14:19] uh four generations back so it's quite
[14:23] recent and therefore it's it's also
[14:26] easier for me I think to communicate
[14:28] that
[14:30] we are not going to to create something
[14:34] new if we if we if we manage to turn
[14:38] back the clock and U just reintroduce
[14:42] monetary Freedom that's something which
[14:44] we have had before it should be possible
[14:47] to implement it again uh and we should
[14:50] uh get the same same type of uh uh of um
[14:55] social and economic gains and advantages
[14:58] from that today as as we had a little
[15:02] bit more than 100 years ago so and
[15:06] that's that's a very important lesson
[15:08] which isn't being taught I think in
[15:11] economics it's it's not being taught in
[15:13] in public schools of course it's um and
[15:17] I think it's too little focus on that
[15:19] also in the Austrian economics tradition
[15:24] it's too much talk about sound money uh
[15:28] gold uh standard
[15:30] and that it would have be good to return
[15:33] to the gold standard no I think it
[15:35] definitely is much better that we just
[15:38] uh uh reintroduce monetary freedom and
[15:42] that should be our objective that should
[15:44] be our focal point in these discussions
[15:47] and from from my perspective um Bitcoin
[15:50] is is the Perfect Tool uh that can help
[15:53] us to to reclaim a monetary Freedom yeah
[15:57] and
[15:59] that's something that I'm also really
[16:00] passionate about because um people
[16:04] especially outside of the Bitcoin World
[16:05] keep asking me yeah but what if Bitcoin
[16:08] fails and I'm like nothing really
[16:10] changes of course like it's it's a big
[16:13] thing if Bitcoin really fails and I I
[16:15] put it at a really really low
[16:17] probability uh now that Bitcoin actually
[16:19] fails but the things that I fight for
[16:22] and I talk about are Bitcoin related
[16:25] because Bitcoin uh incorporates and or
[16:28] or presents those things but the free
[16:32] market the the that we have this
[16:35] selection of what we use as money uh and
[16:39] the Austrian economics also with the
[16:41] sound money and and all the stuff these
[16:43] are all fine principles outside of
[16:46] Bitcoin and those are the things the
[16:48] principles that we that we should teach
[16:51] and Bitcoin just happens to be the best
[16:53] vehicle for now for that and I think it
[16:56] will be the best vehicle for a very long
[16:58] time um but even if it fails the
[17:01] principles the idea of Bitcoin will
[17:03] never fail like the idea of Bitcoin will
[17:05] always be there uh and uh yeah I'm I'm
[17:08] I'm really positive when when the when
[17:11] when we look at the future and what what
[17:13] could happen um you also talked about
[17:15] the monetary freedom and it's like the
[17:18] base of all the other freedoms how do
[17:21] you see the the the world on like
[17:25] monetary Freedom when we see we have a
[17:27] sound money standard or we have at least
[17:29] a standard where people can freely
[17:32] choose which money as we have this
[17:34] monetary Freedom as a base what does
[17:37] this impact how does this impact Society
[17:40] um You probably have a lot of uh also
[17:43] historical examples of of that how this
[17:45] how this looks how Innovation and and
[17:48] companies Thrive that but also like
[17:50] Society changes on top of that I often
[17:54] asked on my podcast um how did your life
[17:57] change while you disc covered Bitcoin
[18:00] and it's interesting what what what
[18:01] comes up uh so how does how do you think
[18:04] uh Society can change on on a monetary
[18:08] Freedom
[18:11] standard okay when when I've been
[18:13] working and thinking about these uh
[18:15] ideas and learning from history I've
[18:18] come to the conclusion that it's useful
[18:21] to to develop sort of an analytical
[18:24] framework for for for for at least to
[18:26] assist my thinking and uh my current
[18:31] anal analytical framework in this Realms
[18:34] is is that uh you have sort of a layer
[18:37] zero which is uh the people's belief
[18:41] system broadly speaking um which which
[18:45] of course includes both ethics and
[18:48] religious U aspects and but but first of
[18:52] all what kind of idea do we have
[18:56] uh about us as human beings uh and um is
[19:02] it um is
[19:05] society overcrowded crowded by people
[19:08] who who think like slaves or is do we
[19:11] mainly have people who are Freedom
[19:14] oriented and and think like free free
[19:17] men and women and um uh so if you if you
[19:21] have a society with people who who have
[19:24] a slave type of mentality then you
[19:27] almost automatically
[19:29] we get a situation
[19:31] where where someone monopolizes the
[19:34] money production and and tells the rest
[19:37] of the population that you have to use
[19:39] my money uh for instance when you pay
[19:42] taxes and and then all other types of
[19:45] money are illegal in in this
[19:47] country on the other hand if if you have
[19:50] a a society with freedom oriented people
[19:54] uh you need sort of sufficient number a
[19:58] high number of of Freedom oriented
[20:00] people then you will be able to to
[20:02] either protect the monetary Freedom if
[20:05] if you already have it or you can
[20:07] reclaim it just like they did after the
[20:10] with the Revolutions in Argentina and
[20:12] the the Netherlands and in the United
[20:15] States and then the question is
[20:19] uh what what do you get on top of the on
[20:23] sort of of the monetary system which
[20:26] becomes sort of a
[20:29] uh layer one in society so we have layer
[20:32] zero is the belief system and layer one
[20:34] is is the monetary system and then
[20:38] everything else in in society will
[20:40] develop in very different ways depending
[20:43] on what kind of monetary system and
[20:45] belief system you have so in generally
[20:49] speaking uh monetary Freedom will tend
[20:52] to decentralize everything uh from
[20:55] economic power to to political power
[20:59] and um and the and also facilitate the
[21:03] economic growth collaboration
[21:05] cooperation on all sort of levels in
[21:10] society and you get Prosperity economic
[21:13] growth uh cultural growth you sort of
[21:19] human flourishing I would say while if
[21:22] you if you have a monetary Monopoly
[21:24] where where someone can inflate and
[21:26] deflate the currency at will
[21:29] then uh you will gradually or or very
[21:32] quickly actually uh destroy civilization
[21:36] and uh that's what we have seen many
[21:38] examples of of course that for instance
[21:42] the Roman Empire it it grew and grew and
[21:45] grew and until it imploded and um so
[21:50] this is some not something new so I
[21:53] think um you you get it's it's almost
[21:58] impossible
[21:59] to to to to grasp how different those uh
[22:04] two types of societies are one with u
[22:07] Monopoly and money production and one
[22:09] with uh monetary Freedom that are so
[22:14] different that it's it's almost
[22:16] impossible for us to to to understand uh
[22:20] how different Society will be if we if
[22:23] we return to monetary
[22:25] freedom and uh I think the best um the
[22:29] best uh sort of um
[22:35] uh way to to investigate this now is is
[22:39] to try to have a look at the people who
[22:43] have transformed the life lives from
[22:46] from living in a total Fiat standard
[22:49] private economy Fiat standard and and
[22:51] made the um made a transition to a
[22:55] Bitcoin standard where they don't have
[22:59] any debt anymore they earn Bitcoin they
[23:02] spend Bitcoin they um and and just look
[23:06] at how how they interact with the world
[23:09] and how those people attract uh other
[23:13] good people and resourceful resourceful
[23:16] people they become like almost like
[23:19] magnets on other um kind and and uh
[23:23] talented people and uh you see it with a
[23:27] with a bit coin economy you you know now
[23:31] that the Bitcoin price has increased so
[23:33] much in just the 14 years since uh it
[23:36] started having to have a price on yeah
[23:39] in May 2010 it's it's it's it's extreme
[23:43] it's impossible for us to understand the
[23:45] speed of this development so so Bitcoin
[23:49] attracts so much of the talent and so
[23:51] much of of of the capital so fast and um
[23:56] that's uh that's what you would
[23:59] expect to see also for instance if you
[24:01] had a country which uh just implemented
[24:04] suddenly overnight uh monetary freedom
[24:07] and abolished its uh its monetary policy
[24:13] so uh if if you if you try to
[24:15] investigate and and and take a look at
[24:18] how how
[24:20] do how do the bitcoiners perform or how
[24:23] how does Bitcoin change people's lives
[24:27] uh I think that's
[24:29] perhaps a a good guide into for us into
[24:34] understand what the transition will will
[24:36] be for our whole
[24:38] society um yeah that's my best answer
[24:42] for that on that question I guess yeah
[24:46] I've seen it I if if people watch this
[24:48] podcast regularly I I ask that question
[24:50] a lot uh and and it's it's so
[24:52] fascinating to see those those answers
[24:54] and to see what what Bitcoin made with
[24:56] their lives and I often compare to uh
[24:59] running in mud and running on a solid
[25:01] Street like if you run in mud you yes
[25:03] you come get forward depending on what
[25:06] mud if feel it's like just a little bit
[25:07] of wet sand uh maybe on the beach or
[25:10] something like that it's it's it's
[25:12] difficult to run but you can come
[25:13] forward but something is dragging you
[25:15] down but what happens all of the sudden
[25:17] if you have a solid Street you can like
[25:19] uh make those card Wheels you can like
[25:21] run in a a circle you can also take a
[25:24] break every once in a while because
[25:26] running got easier and you can can get
[25:28] further ahead uh it's it's it's an maybe
[25:31] too simple of an explanation uh but I
[25:34] think it makes when when the foundation
[25:37] of money is fixed and when the
[25:39] foundation of of life kind is fixed uh a
[25:43] lot of other things get easier and this
[25:46] is where something is really cool you
[25:49] still have to run like even if you adopt
[25:52] a Bitcoin standard if you stop running
[25:54] if you stop doing
[25:56] anything it's also not good like
[25:59] just because you adopt a Bitcoin
[26:01] standard your life does not magically
[26:03] get better but with adopting the proof
[26:06] of work kind of mindset and with with
[26:09] the low time preference mindset and the
[26:11] sound money mindset and this Freedom
[26:14] aspect mindset then those things start
[26:19] kicking in and I funny that you said it
[26:21] in beginning that your book started as
[26:23] an article because I'm trying to write
[26:25] an article on on exactly that phenomen
[26:27] and trying to like get examples from the
[26:29] podcast and things on that like also
[26:32] gets bigger let's see I don't know if I
[26:33] make a book book out of it but uh I'm
[26:36] trying to write an article on on this
[26:38] and and like summarize some key
[26:40] learnings from from the podcast um what
[26:43] I also ask myself this transition like
[26:45] when I go out of my Bitcoin bubble and
[26:50] and go out in in like the family areas
[26:52] in my uh in my other towns and and yeah
[26:56] my old work colleagues and stuff stuff
[26:58] like that where there's this feeld
[27:00] mindset in in Grain we need inflation to
[27:02] grow the economy and all all this stuff
[27:05] um they're really really really deeply
[27:08] in this field mindset and it's I think
[27:09] it's kind of hard to for them to get
[27:11] over that um and then I'm like
[27:14] especially those who who are not having
[27:17] the time to investigate maybe the the
[27:20] the the monetary system too much and
[27:22] they have like one job they maybe even
[27:24] need a second job at some point um they
[27:27] don't have the time to sit back and see
[27:28] like oh what's the monetary system and
[27:30] then we are transitioning where a
[27:33] smaller group of people that got to know
[27:36] about Bitcoin got to know about some
[27:38] money system uh benefit a lot uh over
[27:42] large group of people that are running
[27:44] in that feared wheel and trying to get
[27:47] ahead but they're not um Can this
[27:50] transition be peaceful or is this this
[27:53] transitioning time um getting failing
[27:57] too many people that we kind of end up
[27:59] in a in a mass economic crisis and we
[28:03] have to rebuild stuff like do do you
[28:06] have an I mean it's an
[28:08] impossible uh thing to predict this
[28:11] thing but do you have like kind of a
[28:13] bland scenarios what can happen in in
[28:16] those kind of transition
[28:18] periods predictions are always very
[28:21] challenging of course but uh I I often
[28:26] ask the question what to do you think it
[28:28] would be like if we didn't have uh
[28:31] Bitcoin as an alternative as an as a
[28:35] path forward U I think many people agree
[28:38] that um the Fiat system in most part of
[28:42] the world has um soon come to an end and
[28:45] uh the alternative in the past
[28:49] um there weren't many Alternatives in
[28:51] the in the past when things like this
[28:54] happened it it was sort of U it ended
[28:58] very badly in wars and the
[29:02] and and hyperinflation you know and then
[29:05] it was just rebooted started all over
[29:08] again with a new currency system with
[29:11] new promises from the rulers that they
[29:14] would not um inflate the money supply
[29:17] Etc but then it just yeah you you got a
[29:22] second a new round of the same stuff
[29:25] basically so um
[29:28] I think uh uh if we didn't have Bitcoin
[29:33] it would have it could have become very
[29:35] ugly but Bitcoin the way I perceive it
[29:38] is that it's it almost creates a sort of
[29:41] a bridge and um that bridge wasn't there
[29:45] before now people can walk over that
[29:47] bridge from uh quite um
[29:51] um uh Bleak uh uh situation where sort
[29:56] of
[29:58] situation where there very very many
[30:01] Alternatives many good options at all uh
[30:04] and if you if you just are willing to to
[30:07] start walking over that bridge you learn
[30:10] as you walk and and you get
[30:12] opportunities and meet people while you
[30:14] walk uh and uh you develop your your
[30:19] your skills and your understanding and
[30:21] uh uh it it's sort of U it's almost like
[30:24] a life uh raft so to speak
[30:29] so that's a a very important alternative
[30:34] to have compared to not having any good
[30:36] options uh
[30:38] in in a situation where where the Fiat
[30:42] system uh sort of comes towards and
[30:47] collapse so I I think it's it's
[30:50] important to have that perspective and
[30:53] and then the question is um how will it
[30:56] um
[30:58] uh how will it be this time will will
[31:03] sort
[31:04] of
[31:06] uh will will
[31:09] Bitcoin affect the overall transition
[31:13] there uh for the better for for the
[31:16] whole of society or will it just be uh
[31:19] something which um uh creates
[31:23] opportunities for a softer Landing for
[31:25] those people who discover Bitcoin
[31:28] uh and and start to make use of it um
[31:31] start walking that bridge I'm not sure
[31:34] it's a it's a this has never happened
[31:37] before you know so it's very difficult
[31:39] to to to predict what will happen to
[31:42] Society at
[31:43] large
[31:45] uh but what I feel is
[31:48] that um
[31:51] Bitcoin it attacks the incentive
[31:54] structures in society and really
[31:57] impressive
[31:58] way and the incentives they guide our
[32:02] actions uh all the time either
[32:05] consciously or
[32:06] subconsciously and uh and uh we should
[32:10] also keep in mind that what that's
[32:13] something that I write about in uh the
[32:16] second book I I've written which is
[32:18] called unbar that that is the fact that
[32:22] human beings we are experts in copying
[32:25] others
[32:26] Behavior so we copy other people's
[32:30] behavior whether it's good behavior or
[32:33] bad behavior depending
[32:36] on um very much depending on the on the
[32:40] incentive structure in society what kind
[32:43] of situation we find ourselves in so if
[32:46] if it if I benefit if I survive due to
[32:50] copying your bad behavior Robin then I
[32:54] will do that and and some people will
[32:56] also do it because because they not just
[32:59] toy but because they profit in the short
[33:01] term they will do that um
[33:05] but what sort of opens up now is a is a
[33:11] is a is a whole new economy uh with
[33:14] within the Bitcoin
[33:16] Community with the totally different
[33:18] inen structures compared to the to to
[33:21] the world outside and uh I think that
[33:24] will sort of um uh
[33:28] become so powerful that it uh it becomes
[33:32] almost too obvious for for The Outsiders
[33:35] that this is something good this is a
[33:36] Force for good this is a positive
[33:39] Community we we see a lot of
[33:41] developments with within the Bitcoin um
[33:44] community and Bitcoin economy we also
[33:47] want to do this we want to be part of
[33:49] this uh whether it's uh um becoming
[33:53] owner investing in Bitcoin or if it's um
[33:56] just a connecting to to to that social
[34:00] sphere uh of society of life I think
[34:07] um very many things can happen there uh
[34:10] as as we progress and um this will
[34:14] affect uh also people
[34:18] who who have been in positions you know
[34:22] where they have been used to it was
[34:25] completely natural for them to be
[34:27] political leaders and use uh Power uh
[34:32] and and to com command Society command
[34:34] other people to do as they wanted to do
[34:37] because they had some Grand ideas you
[34:39] know for society and how it develops uh
[34:42] at one one point many of those people as
[34:46] well will be affected by uh bitcoin's
[34:50] incentive uh structure and and and they
[34:52] will become aware of what's what's going
[34:55] on within the Bitcoin community so in
[34:58] the end everybody will be affected by
[35:00] this and uh so uh the psychological and
[35:04] so sociological um aspects of this uh
[35:08] shouldn't be underestimated I think it's
[35:11] not only about how the economy develops
[35:16] I'm I'm I'm positive I'm optimistic by
[35:21] by nature of course that's that's my
[35:24] person personality but I think
[35:28] you really need to understand this this
[35:30] this has never happened before and uh I
[35:33] think it's important that we put aside
[35:36] U many of those most dramatic uh
[35:41] catastrophic scenarios uh so to speak
[35:45] and and rather uh have a look at the
[35:47] opportunities what can we do with this
[35:50] uh fantastic tool that we have now uh
[35:53] called Bitcoin as a monetary technology
[35:55] and and how can we uh take advantage of
[35:59] the social layer of Bitcoin which is
[36:01] even more in in my view even much more
[36:04] impressive uh than the technology itself
[36:08] so if we if we make good use of this we
[36:10] can create our own future instead of um
[36:14] fearing for a catastrophe and uh waiting
[36:18] it out and see what happens and and hope
[36:20] that Bitcoin will uh save me and my
[36:23] family and perhaps my local community or
[36:25] something like that you know so be
[36:28] proactive be be proud of being a
[36:30] bitcoiner connect with the normis and
[36:33] the um yeah show them um show them uh
[36:39] some a different set set of values and
[36:43] uh uh just um yeah go Mo move forward
[36:47] and and be proud of what what we what we
[36:50] have learned and uh what we have become
[36:53] that's that's my idea if you are
[36:55] listening to this podcast you might be
[36:57] wondering what is actually the setup
[36:59] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[37:02] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[37:04] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[37:06] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[37:08] right way let's focus on the first thing
[37:11] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[37:13] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[37:15] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[37:17] an exchange that has an own token or
[37:19] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[37:21] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[37:25] for me the best partner for that and now
[37:28] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[37:30] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[37:32] a self custody solution where you
[37:36] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[37:38] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[37:42] Solutions that's a bit box you just put
[37:44] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[37:47] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[37:51] Bitcoin hardless if you have more than
[37:53] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[37:56] have one last thing before we get back
[37:58] to the video I'm really passionate about
[38:00] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[38:03] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[38:06] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[38:09] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[38:12] conference in whole of Europe for all
[38:14] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[38:16] this place in June for all europs it's a
[38:19] must go anyways you so close to the
[38:22] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[38:24] to come I will do interviews there and I
[38:26] would love to meet you all there use
[38:29] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[38:32] discounts and use the links down in the
[38:34] description I hope and I always advocate
[38:37] for like a slow fall of of the feat
[38:39] system because if it's falling too fast
[38:42] it's like the tanic sinking too fast
[38:43] that we don't have time that the people
[38:45] come to the live rafts as as you said on
[38:48] bitcoin with like this bridge to to a
[38:51] free market free monetary system um but
[38:54] what did you mean by using the social
[38:57] layer of of Bitcoin like what's what
[38:59] what do you mean by that okay for
[39:02] instance um you know I I haven't been uh
[39:06] in the Bitcoin Community for more than a
[39:08] couple of years now so I I don't know it
[39:12] inside out and I don't have the sort of
[39:14] historical understanding of how it has
[39:17] developed but uh when I started to to
[39:21] try to learn about Bitcoin I uh I felt
[39:25] that the community was a little bit
[39:26] close
[39:28] uh and that U for instance um some of
[39:31] the first impressions I I got was that
[39:33] uh some bitcoiners wanted it to be close
[39:37] probably because they felt safer there
[39:40] they had found their community and they
[39:42] talked a lot about the need to study for
[39:44] thousands of hours before you can
[39:47] understand Bitcoin that sort of sent a
[39:49] message to no coiners to the norm is
[39:52] that this is so complex this is um this
[39:55] isn't very easy at all and you are an
[39:58] outsider we are the Insiders who have
[40:00] discovered this Wonder wonderful thing
[40:03] so those signals I know took notice of
[40:06] and U and uh once I'm on the inside I
[40:10] see that uh now after so many bitcoiners
[40:14] have embraced fraud coin and uh opened
[40:17] up or yeah onboarding me as well uh then
[40:21] I I I I realized that quite a lot of
[40:25] bitcoiners have given up on the norm
[40:28] um they think it's difficult to do the
[40:32] orange peeling they um find it hard to
[40:36] have um uh to have discussions talk with
[40:39] uh people who are who aren't
[40:42] bitcoiners because the mindset is so
[40:45] different uh
[40:47] Etc and
[40:49] um they isolate themselves a little bit
[40:53] in within the community and when you
[40:55] combine that with with sort of uh aair
[41:01] also quite a few bitcoiners have come
[41:04] across they have a sort of a uh they are
[41:07] proud but they they don't want to be
[41:09] open about being bitcoiners and not not
[41:13] being openly proud about being
[41:15] bitcoiners because they feel that the
[41:18] the rest of society uh they think
[41:21] bitcoiners are uh something strange U
[41:26] very strange fellow you know uh they
[41:29] they're pushing uh a pyramid scheme a
[41:34] pony scheme on on the rest of the people
[41:36] that's why they are trying to orange
[41:38] pill us you know that's that's that's
[41:41] the the idea that quite a lot of
[41:43] bitcoiners have about the norm is so
[41:45] they don't yeah they distance themselves
[41:48] from them and uh
[41:50] they uh they um not not all of them of
[41:55] course but quite quite quite a lot and I
[41:57] would I would like to have a I would
[42:00] like to see uh some progress in this
[42:03] domain that that people uh open up about
[42:06] being bitcoiners and and talk about why
[42:08] it's so positive to to be in the Bitcoin
[42:12] Community why they are proud of being
[42:15] bitcoiners uh what kind of values they
[42:18] have what kind of interests they have
[42:19] what it has done with their lives Etc
[42:22] and talk less about uh uh the economic
[42:26] and politic iCal aspects of it more
[42:28] about the social aspects of it I think
[42:31] that would be good but then then you you
[42:34] must have a change in me mentality in
[42:37] the Bitcoin Community there where it's
[42:40] it's okay it's positive if we go out and
[42:43] are are
[42:46] uh actively showing the rest of the
[42:49] society that we are proud of being
[42:51] bitcoiners that's that's one big reason
[42:54] why I decided to go out with my full
[42:56] name full disclosure like on every
[42:59] social media I'm like okay I'm Bitcoin
[43:01] guy I in in my my real life uh I'm
[43:06] actually way more defensive like when
[43:10] someone when i' I get the feeling that
[43:12] someone is um inclined to understand
[43:16] Bitcoin or they they want to understand
[43:18] Bitcoin I'm really like just showing
[43:20] them everything and I have prepared a
[43:23] YouTube playlist I have prepared like a
[43:25] book list what they can get into like
[43:27] whatever they they want to have like my
[43:30] own small uh orange pilling Set uh that
[43:33] I give people that I by the way I
[43:35] encourage everybody to have it like have
[43:37] just a notes note page on the phone
[43:40] where you can just quickly copy that and
[43:43] um and send them per WhatsApp something
[43:45] like that that that's that's a really
[43:47] nice Game Changer because you cannot
[43:49] explain them everything they have to
[43:51] discover them themselves um but from the
[43:55] early days where I was really heavily
[43:57] orange pilling like I was really going
[43:59] hey did you hear about Bitcoin and I
[44:01] felt a little bit like a a religious guy
[44:05] who just wants to tell everybody he he
[44:07] found
[44:09] god um the missionary man exactly and
[44:12] from that I completely went away and I'm
[44:16] I'm having that approach to be as happy
[44:19] and successful and um and present in the
[44:22] world as possible and being just a role
[44:25] model in general in life uh with
[44:27] everything that I can do and then also
[44:31] mention that I'm doing Bitcoin and then
[44:33] that I call myself a bitcoiner and I
[44:35] think that's how I can associate in my
[44:39] small circle oh he's doing good in life
[44:43] he's a bitcoiner like that's that's how
[44:45] I try to do it uh and in just like when
[44:48] people ask uh like these days inflation
[44:52] comes out a lot uh economic comes out
[44:55] quite a lot on on discussions on on
[44:57] tables and then just like try to like oh
[45:00] did you thought about Bitcoin is is did
[45:02] ever did you ever occur about like think
[45:05] about Bitcoin I I don't try to push it I
[45:07] just like try to bring it in
[45:09] conversations and and uh people that are
[45:11] interested then come usually afterwards
[45:14] usually when they're not when the other
[45:15] people involved to me hey what's that
[45:18] Bitcoin thing are you involved in that
[45:19] and then then I show them but yeah it's
[45:22] fascinating how do orange Builder there
[45:23] should be books about that
[45:27] I guess there are many books about that
[45:29] as well but uh yeah no I think um
[45:33] everybody needs to find their own way
[45:35] into Bitcoin but I think at least it's
[45:38] uh easier easier for for for people to
[45:42] discover it if bitcoiners are openly
[45:45] proud about what they are and what they
[45:48] represent their values and the yeah and
[45:51] their Jour journey and how it has
[45:54] changed their lives instead of sort of
[45:57] not not wanting to talk about it too
[46:00] much because they are afraid about what
[46:02] they think of of of you as a Bitcoin
[46:05] since you admit that you are a bitcoiner
[46:08] so we we need to come out strong and uh
[46:11] yeah be proud of what we are I think uh
[46:14] yeah a Le for quite many
[46:17] people yeah I I talked to some
[46:20] bitcoiners that are Anonymous and uh
[46:24] first of all I always like completely
[46:27] respect like I already have like five
[46:29] six episodes on the podcast that are
[46:31] completely Anonymous then they show
[46:33] don't show the name they show don't show
[46:35] anything I had one discussion with a
[46:37] fellow who was Anonymous and he said to
[46:40] me I think he even said it live on the
[46:42] podcast that he doesn't even tell his
[46:46] son that he is in Bitcoin like not even
[46:48] his family knows that he is in Bitcoin
[46:51] he just wants to be completely Anonymous
[46:52] and put the Bitcoin side of things away
[46:56] from all the rest of his life because
[46:59] he fears that there might be some
[47:02] attacks on bitcoin he's fearful of uh
[47:05] this transitioning phase of when the old
[47:08] system is crashing down and the new
[47:10] system is is is coming alive that there
[47:12] is some collateral damage in between
[47:16] with outspoken bitcoiners and I thought
[47:19] about that and my my short conclusion is
[47:22] even if this happens I don't want to
[47:24] hide uh but other people might feel
[47:27] differently and it's I respect
[47:30] everyone's decision to be anonymous uh
[47:32] and and it's it's totally fine for me uh
[47:35] but if if you want to be outspoken you
[47:37] definitely should be it has also
[47:39] advantages to your personal life if you
[47:41] associate yourself with great technology
[47:43] that appreciates that much in purchasing
[47:45] power what what are your thoughts on
[47:48] that of course it's um impossible for me
[47:52] to put myself in every other's situation
[47:56] and and uh of course is if you're if you
[48:00] if you if it's a lifethreatening
[48:02] uh situation for you if you admit that
[48:05] you are a bitcoiner or if you if it's
[48:08] very likely that you will um attract the
[48:13] gangsters attackers you know people can
[48:16] who can harm you and your family if if
[48:19] if you are in such a situation then of
[48:22] course um I respect that decision but I
[48:25] I suspect that uh quite many people who
[48:28] who who Stay s silent about
[48:32] their about themselves being bitcoiners
[48:35] um they aren't in in such a situation
[48:38] just they just want to be on the safe
[48:41] side um and I have uh some difficulties
[48:46] uh with that if if they aren't sort of
[48:49] someone who who has a position for
[48:52] instance in in the in the Bitcoin sphere
[48:55] where it's very important for them to be
[48:59] uh Anonymous uh out of uh for instance U
[49:05] U security due to security concerns for
[49:10] instance I understand perhaps that some
[49:11] core developers they don't want to to
[49:15] risk
[49:16] um disclosing who they their identity
[49:20] because that's also could be some kind
[49:23] of risk for Bitcoin that might be a
[49:25] situation but for for most of the people
[49:28] I think it's uh it's very important that
[49:30] they come out and uh are open about it
[49:34] um the more the better and of course
[49:38] it's uh it's so much easier for others
[49:40] to come out and be open about it uh when
[49:43] when many when many people uh admit that
[49:47] I have been silent about this for for
[49:49] years but now I think it's about time
[49:51] that I am open about being a bitcoiner
[49:55] and I think that all this should we
[49:57] should do the same that could be very
[50:00] very possible positive for the for the
[50:02] future development of um of U Bitcoin
[50:06] adoption I'm quite convinced of of that
[50:09] actually yeah
[50:11] it's if if you represent something
[50:14] positive if you are in a community which
[50:17] is good for for for society and good for
[50:20] how Society develops I think you need to
[50:24] to to be open about it uh if you want to
[50:27] if you want
[50:28] to sort of spark interest uh yeah or
[50:34] or uh create more interest for it and
[50:37] and attract uh others think of it like
[50:41] um being a a magnet so so to speak uh
[50:46] that nobody sees nobody understand that
[50:48] they are close to a magnet if if you
[50:52] have adopted these values and and you
[50:55] understand Bitcoin you have a good
[50:58] understanding of the Bitcoin social
[51:00] layer and the the economics of Bitcoin
[51:04] and the economics of of
[51:06] Fiat um then you are a resource in
[51:10] society and you shouldn't hide you
[51:12] should you should be there and uh and
[51:14] and be that person who attracts other
[51:17] other people other good people other
[51:20] people with big hearts other people with
[51:23] resources because you need to sort of
[51:27] um uh make it possible for for for them
[51:30] also to
[51:31] flourish uh that's that's my idea at
[51:34] least that you you you if if you can you
[51:37] should Inspire others and you will see
[51:40] that you will attract some of the best
[51:41] and brightest um people around you if if
[51:46] you do that so please please come out
[51:49] and uh be open about it if it's if it
[51:53] does doesn't put you in a
[51:55] lifethreatening situation that's at
[51:57] least my message 100% And um one more
[52:02] question on that topic do you think it's
[52:04] important that satosi Nakamoto is not
[52:07] known or would or differently ask would
[52:10] Bitcoin as successful as it is now when
[52:15] Satoshi Nakamoto is just a random guy
[52:17] like maybe Adam back or maybe even
[52:20] Michael S or something like
[52:23] that well I haven't given too much
[52:27] thought to that question but I know that
[52:30] some people argue that it he could
[52:32] become sort of an attack vector and uh
[52:36] and U if if he if he came out and U uh
[52:42] disclosed his identity it it might be
[52:45] that uh people would
[52:49] be very interested in in having
[52:53] his hearing his thoughts about how
[52:56] Bitcoin should develop in the future and
[52:59] uh it might be that his ideas uh for for
[53:02] how to design Bitcoin from the outset
[53:05] was uh that those ideas were great but
[53:08] what if his ideas about how Bitcoin
[53:11] should develop in the future are not so
[53:13] very great and then uh perhaps it would
[53:16] be a disadvantage disadvantage because
[53:20] um a lot of people would listen to
[53:22] bitcoin's Creator you know and and give
[53:24] a lot of um emphasis
[53:28] uh and think that this is very important
[53:31] to listen to him he knows best he's a
[53:33] genius you know perhaps it's better that
[53:37] this is a decentralized process where
[53:40] where we don't have a Bitcoin God who
[53:43] who
[53:44] who um affects the development uh too
[53:48] much so I think yeah but I guess uh U
[53:54] that's a very
[53:56] that's a topic of of its own who it
[54:00] should it could probably be be written
[54:02] books about that topic uh as well made a
[54:08] a thesis about what would happen if if
[54:11] um satosi came out and and told us our
[54:17] his story as I think no I think it's
[54:21] best that he just disappeared and it's
[54:24] uh um of course of course it's a
[54:27] wonderful gift that he has
[54:29] uh um given to us and um I think um the
[54:36] story is just so much more powerful um
[54:40] because of his
[54:43] disappearance I love it so much and and
[54:46] I even he now when I discuss and talk
[54:49] with bitcoiners or even outside of
[54:52] bitcoiners like um um um Al coiners or
[54:56] as I call them Corners um they
[55:00] often argue like oh but in the Bitcoin
[55:03] wi Satoshi says that and that and then
[55:06] they try to interpret his words so that
[55:09] they fit in their kind of scheme so I
[55:12] think it's really positive that he's not
[55:15] known um and that he's kind of I think
[55:20] he knew that he would be a vulnerability
[55:23] for Bitcoin and he he even like wanted
[55:26] to do to get rid of his
[55:29] own personality in Bitcoin because he
[55:31] knew he was attack factor and he's a
[55:34] vulnerability but uh let's come closer
[55:37] to to the end routine of the podcast um
[55:39] before we get there I have one more
[55:41] question uh to your new book uh you said
[55:44] it's an upcoming book or is it already
[55:47] out the the how was it called something
[55:50] with Truth uh I forgot the name it's
[55:53] called The Arrow of Truth
[55:56] arrow on truth and the subtitle is from
[56:00] foret to satosi and
[56:03] Beyond and
[56:05] um this book is of course about Bitcoin
[56:09] um it's a you can say that it's a split
[56:13] in two uh where the first half describes
[56:18] uh the problem that Bitcoin tries to
[56:20] solve and and the second half uh
[56:23] explains uh Bitcoin and how it solves it
[56:26] and um in the subtitle uh we mention the
[56:30] Norse
[56:32] god um forti and he was the God of
[56:36] Justice in the Norse
[56:39] mythology and um we we we make quite a
[56:44] lot of use of um storytelling
[56:47] from uh Norse mythology or not Norse
[56:51] mythology but um uh but the Viking age
[56:54] once more just like with did in uh fraud
[56:57] coin but we dive a little bit deeper
[57:00] into what kind of society this was and
[57:03] what it was that made it possible for
[57:05] people to have uh so much Freedom that
[57:10] they had and uh also to have monetary
[57:13] freedom and how they defended their
[57:16] their freedom and we we try to um
[57:21] communicate uh some parallels between
[57:25] that those social structures and also
[57:29] and compare it with the technical
[57:31] structure of of
[57:33] Bitcoin um in in order to make it easier
[57:36] for people to understand also the
[57:38] technical architecture of Bitcoin and
[57:41] this book AR old truth is uh is filled
[57:44] with um illustrations created by my
[57:47] partner graphic designer motis stward
[57:50] hug so it's going to be a basically a
[57:55] piece of art uh when once we have
[57:57] finished it this book grew and grew and
[58:01] grew so now it's 450 pages long so it's
[58:04] quite a big book and uh we hope to to be
[58:07] able to to print the first batch of the
[58:10] English edition now
[58:12] perhaps uh to have it ready to BTC
[58:16] Prague which is an upcoming event in
[58:19] three weeks from now so so yeah uh
[58:23] that's the situation uh for for that
[58:25] book we have Great Expectations uh uh
[58:29] for for this book uh many people have
[58:31] been waiting eagerly now for yeah we
[58:34] have been talking about this book for
[58:35] more than a year so so this is a very
[58:39] big thing for for for matis and the ey
[58:43] oh really cool I look forward to it and
[58:44] I will also be in in Bitcoin Prague uh
[58:47] and and yeah look look forward to to
[58:50] seeing you in
[58:52] person um excellent thank to you then
[58:55] let's come to the tin uh my my new kind
[58:59] of un unofficial tin question before the
[59:02] actual tin is what are you currently
[59:05] passionate about besides Bitcoin like
[59:07] what what topic uh or what deep learning
[59:10] are you doing besides the topic of
[59:13] Bitcoin
[59:15] okay you can say that
[59:18] um my the period from about 2002 to 2010
[59:24] I was an avid read and uh read a lot of
[59:28] Austrian economics and all kinds of
[59:30] literature but uh after I started
[59:33] writing books I've written four books
[59:36] now uh
[59:38] then uh it was sort of investigative uh
[59:41] reading trying to identify the the
[59:44] literature that had the uh information
[59:48] that I needed in order to complete the
[59:50] books so it was a very sort targeted
[59:53] reading and uh I I would uh love to to
[59:57] start reading again uh more broadly uh
[60:00] just to develop um my understanding of U
[60:05] yeah humankind and sociology and
[60:09] psychology Etc but I'm I'm a bit tired
[60:13] of all the reading that I've been doing
[60:15] the last four three three years and all
[60:17] the writing so now at the moment I try
[60:20] to dedicate more of my time to physical
[60:23] activities so I just recently picked up
[60:26] uh uh doing a lot of uh training and try
[60:30] to to to look at um things how to
[60:33] improve my health in terms of nutrition
[60:36] sleep uh everything like that and uh
[60:40] yeah develop those um sides of uh of
[60:44] Runa uh yeah perhaps uh um yeah and
[60:50] learn something about health and uh
[60:52] things like that uh that's my that's my
[60:55] passion
[60:56] at the at the time and and of course I
[61:00] must say that uh it's just a year since
[61:05] I was to my I attended my first Bitcoin
[61:08] conference which actually was in
[61:10] Prague um a little bit more than 11
[61:14] months ago since then I've been to quite
[61:17] a lot of U meetups Bitcoin meetups and I
[61:21] also attended the the conference in in
[61:25] Madera
[61:26] so I'm I'm developing a passion for for
[61:30] being together with the bitcoiners in
[61:32] conferences and also um sort of from a
[61:37] pro professionals perspective it's very
[61:40] important to to develop my uh skills as
[61:43] a public speaker um so I'm going to give
[61:47] a speech a keynote speech in Prague I'm
[61:50] very much looking forward to that and uh
[61:52] I'm I'm having a lot of speaking
[61:54] engagements here in Norway and uh yeah
[61:59] and uh this is uh becoming more and more
[62:02] of a passion for me trying to connect
[62:05] with people when I'm present together
[62:08] with people physically in um yeah in
[62:11] events like this that's uh that's one of
[62:14] my main um Ambitions uh in in in the
[62:17] near future actually so not so much
[62:20] reading and uh and and writing the the
[62:22] the upcoming few years I guess but more
[62:25] talking to people attending conferences
[62:28] and and giving presentations uh things
[62:30] like that and uh yeah to do something to
[62:34] be more physical not so much in the
[62:38] digital domain and and in deep deeply
[62:42] buried in inside of thick
[62:46] books that's what my my present U time
[62:50] looks like and uh what I think my future
[62:53] should look like the the nearest Future
[62:55] at least this this sounds very healthy
[62:59] sounds very
[63:00] good sometimes we get carried away and
[63:03] like uh and producing a lot and
[63:06] consuming a lot and sometimes it's like
[63:08] really really really good to just go out
[63:10] for a walk go out for a run go out for
[63:12] training workout swimming whatever you
[63:15] uh you end up doing uh and yeah I can
[63:18] only encourage everybody to to come to
[63:20] bitcoin progress as you also there with
[63:22] a keynote I will be there I will I will
[63:25] have at this point I think I record
[63:27] three podcasts there in different
[63:30] locations in the in the area so this
[63:32] will be also really cool uh so I uh as
[63:36] as Bitcoin brag uh Bitcoin brag is my
[63:40] reason why I'm so passionate now about
[63:42] Bitcoin uh like it it leveled my
[63:45] understanding of Bitcoin and the
[63:48] commitment that I took to bitcoin way up
[63:51] like meeting all those great bitcoiners
[63:53] that's why I was also really um glad
[63:56] when uh um Matias asked me if if they
[64:00] can sponsor the podcast I was like yeah
[64:03] constantly talk about Bitcoin prog
[64:05] anyway so if I get money for that I
[64:07] definitely do that so I encourage
[64:09] actually everybody to to get get tickets
[64:12] get uh get yourself to to to Prague if
[64:15] you have the possibility and if you have
[64:16] the financial means to to visit Prague
[64:19] uh depending on where you are could be
[64:21] difficult but uh it's it's definitely
[64:23] something that is great when you are in
[64:26] the Bitcoin community and you either try
[64:29] to just understand it better or you want
[64:32] to even make something careerwise in in
[64:36] the Bitcoin it's it's it's amazing what
[64:38] what such a conference like just two
[64:41] three days uh can do and yeah if you you
[64:44] want to do something in Bitcoin you
[64:46] basically have to be in in the Bitcoin
[64:48] conferences uh or Cent online to get
[64:51] connections but uh physical connections
[64:54] uh are not beaten by online
[64:57] connections perfect then let's come to
[64:59] the end routine uh the end routine is
[65:01] where the previous guest is asking a
[65:03] question for the for the next guest
[65:04] without knowing who the next guest is
[65:07] and it's an H perfectly suiting Andre
[65:10] tetin to to to the Bitcoin conferences
[65:13] um what would be your favorite theme
[65:15] song walking into a Bitcoin conference
[65:18] walking into a Bitcoin conference you
[65:20] mean like when giving a keynote or when
[65:24] the Bitcoin conference opens or let's
[65:26] say uh the keynote I mean this question
[65:29] is like always comes from the previous
[65:30] guest so I don't know if he means it
[65:32] like that or meant about that but but I
[65:35] think it would
[65:37] be which
[65:39] tune oh that was a tough one I think uh
[65:45] I think Eminem has a great rap song from
[65:48] his
[65:49] uh um8 mile track what was that never
[65:55] enough
[65:57] Never Enough no it's not that one it's
[66:00] the soundtrack for 8 Mile let me just
[66:03] have a look Eight Mile
[66:09] soundtrack oh Luci yourself Lose
[66:12] Yourself Lose Yourself yeah that's my
[66:15] one of my favorite
[66:17] um um rap songs so yeah I I really like
[66:22] that one I think it's sort of um uh
[66:25] emphasizes the need to to take a good to
[66:29] make good use of the opportunity that
[66:31] has opened up for you now you have to
[66:33] just uh just do it don't think too much
[66:36] and just do it yeah absolutely and
[66:40] depending on where we are with the price
[66:42] in in in June uh in in with the Bitcoin
[66:45] product maybe Pump It Up would also be
[66:50] good
[66:52] definitely important for Bitcoin
[66:54] adoption as well
[66:56] definitely um where can people find you
[66:58] if they have like questions to your book
[67:00] questions from what we discussed in the
