[00:00] I would point to as a catalyst and where
[00:02] we could begin is when China banned
[00:04] Bitcoin mining. It caused a lot of
[00:06] Bitcoin mining to move to the United
[00:07] States and that caused it to get on the
[00:10] radar of Elizabeth Warren and other
[00:14] groups that are anti- Bitcoin. We really
[00:17] emphasized in all of our conversations
[00:19] with policy makers and all of our
[00:21] communications with the public
[00:23] highlighting the value of having a
[00:26] decentralized monetary system and that
[00:28] the only way to achieve that value and
[00:30] to secure it is with Bitcoin mining. Two
[00:32] years ago they were saying, "Oh, we
[00:33] don't like Bitcoin mining." Now they're
[00:35] saying, "We love Bitcoin. Let's buy
[00:36] Bitcoin." Ultimately, if we were to look
[00:39] at it objectively, that's what they
[00:41] should do is that the Federal Reserve
[00:43] should just create lots of dollars and
[00:45] buy up Bitcoin and build up a Bitcoin
[00:48] reserve that way. You know, there's
[00:49] confusion about Bitcoin versus crypto.
[00:53] This is the kind of confusion that can
[00:55] only be addressed by a strategic Bitcoin
[00:58] reserve because it forces that
[01:00] conversation. This is how things begin
[01:02] is they start small.
[01:06] [Music]
[01:08] give us an overview for for people that
[01:10] don't know you like what are you doing
[01:12] in Bitcoin especially also with with the
[01:14] the the focus on nation states. Yeah,
[01:18] absolutely. So, uh just by way of
[01:21] background um I got really interested in
[01:23] Bitcoin because I was very interested in
[01:26] open- source software. So, I was
[01:29] installing Linux on my parents'
[01:30] computers in high school. uh and I was
[01:33] also interested in monetary economics
[01:35] and um within that the Austrian school
[01:38] of economics uh that really emphasized
[01:41] sound money uh and gold and silver and
[01:45] 100% reserve banking. So when I
[01:48] discovered Bitcoin at the end of 2012,
[01:52] it was at the intersection of these two
[01:54] interests of open-source and sound
[01:56] money. Uh so I immediately became very
[01:59] obsessed with it. uh and have been
[02:02] researching it uh since uh and and
[02:05] writing about it and speaking about it.
[02:08] Um now over the years I've had different
[02:11] roles within the industry. So uh I I
[02:14] worked at Bit Pay which is a Bitcoin
[02:16] payment processing company. I I worked
[02:19] at Kraken uh which is a large exchange.
[02:22] Uh and most recently I worked at Riot
[02:25] Platforms which is a publicly traded
[02:28] Bitcoin miner here in the US.
[02:30] um which I just left earlier this month.
[02:33] So now I'm really just uh focused on
[02:35] Bitcoin education uh for all the
[02:38] different kinds of demographics that are
[02:41] getting interested uh more so in Bitcoin
[02:43] now than in the past. Um, and in that
[02:46] regard, it has really exceeded all of my
[02:49] expectations that we now have lots of
[02:53] government officials who are interested
[02:55] in Bitcoin in a positive manner rather
[02:58] than in a negative manner like they have
[03:00] been in the past. Uh, so, you know, my
[03:03] my role at at Riot was really pushing
[03:06] back against Elizabeth Horn. uh that was
[03:10] um you know she's a senator from
[03:11] Massachusetts who was very antagonistic
[03:14] towards Bitcoin mining for what she
[03:16] described as environmental reasons
[03:18] although you know she had her other
[03:20] reasons for that as well. Um but now
[03:23] that that kind of skeptical anti-Bitcoin
[03:27] voice has been um denied airspace uh
[03:32] within politics uh there's really a lot
[03:35] of room for education for Bitcoin in a
[03:38] positive direction of explaining what
[03:39] its value is, why so many voters are
[03:43] interested in it and are um you know
[03:46] want to vote for candidates who are pro
[03:49] Bitcoin and then what pro Bitcoin policy
[03:52] looks like uh beyond just the do no harm
[03:56] of looking at okay how can we actually
[03:58] help Bitcoin how can we advance this
[04:00] movement uh and in particular with
[04:02] strategic Bitcoin reserves
[04:05] that's super interesting so you have a
[04:07] lot of actually a lot of insights of
[04:08] like exchange major exchange with Kraken
[04:11] major minor and and and all the things
[04:13] that you've done uh that's super
[04:15] interesting um for how long are you are
[04:17] you doing uh are you already doing
[04:19] working in in Bitcoin that seems like uh
[04:22] already some some years that you have
[04:24] done. Yeah, it's been 12 years now. Uh
[04:27] and so uh I still feel like uh we're
[04:30] we're very early. So uh you know I I I
[04:34] still have a lot of enthusiasm because
[04:38] we haven't accomplished the mission. And
[04:41] when I when I first was telling my my
[04:44] now wife about Bitcoin uh back in 2013,
[04:48] I told her, "Hey, look, next year, uh
[04:50] there's not going to be a financial
[04:52] system anymore. It's all going to be
[04:54] replaced by Bitcoin." Uh and so I, you
[04:57] know, I had this like, hey, it's about
[04:58] to happen, uh type mentality. And then
[05:01] with every year that went by, I realized
[05:04] that I was wrong about that. uh that
[05:06] it's going to take a many years if not
[05:10] decades in order to uh really achieve
[05:13] what we would call hyper bitcoinization
[05:15] of bringing the whole world on the
[05:17] bitcoin standard uh and really changing
[05:19] people's thinking about it.
[05:22] So it's still now like it's already a
[05:25] decade so you're still thinking like uh
[05:27] it will still take like decades from now
[05:31] uh to to get this hyper bitcoinization.
[05:33] By the way, I I agree. I also thought it
[05:36] will go faster and faster and now it's
[05:38] happening and it's like it takes longer.
[05:41] Yeah. I think I think that the the the
[05:43] crucial difference between Bitcoin as a
[05:45] technology and iPhones as a technology
[05:48] for example is that um when it so as a
[05:52] currency it's entirely momentum driven.
[05:55] So there's nothing really about it's not
[05:57] about the utility of it. It's about what
[05:59] was its price yesterday. And so when the
[06:01] Bitcoin price is going up, that attracts
[06:04] a lot of adoption. Uh and then that
[06:06] causes the Bitcoin price to go up. So
[06:08] that's the momentum aspect of Bitcoin
[06:10] adoption. Um and then eventually you get
[06:12] a point where people are way
[06:15] overleveraged. Uh and there's no more
[06:18] net new adoption and in fact you have
[06:21] disadion. So what happens is that the
[06:24] OGs who bought at $10, they sell at
[06:27] $1,000 or they sell at $10,000. uh so
[06:30] that they can buy a Lambo or pay for
[06:33] their kids' college or pay off their
[06:36] parents' mortgage or donate to a
[06:38] charity, right? So, there's lots of
[06:40] reasons for why the wealth effect causes
[06:43] older adopters to sell their Bitcoin and
[06:46] hand the baton on to the next
[06:48] generation, but then that causes the
[06:50] crash, right? And then, uh when the
[06:52] Bitcoin price is going down, that
[06:54] actually um pushes adoption away, right?
[06:57] because who wants to adopt something
[06:59] that's going down in value? Uh, and
[07:01] until you finally reach the bottom of
[07:04] the bare market and then the cycle
[07:06] starts all over again. Now, if you
[07:09] compare that to, for example, the
[07:10] iPhone, you don't have that phenomenon
[07:13] of people buying and hoarding iPhones
[07:16] because they think the value of the
[07:18] iPhone is going to go up and then
[07:20] selling their iPhones at the top, right?
[07:23] Uh so uh it's a completely different
[07:26] dynamic in a monetary technology
[07:29] adoption than in a normal utility
[07:32] technology adoption.
[07:34] That's an interesting point. I never
[07:36] thought about that actually. Uh the the
[07:38] cycle difference because we see all
[07:40] those technology trends and how fast
[07:43] they're going like electricity, the
[07:44] internet, smartphones and all those
[07:46] things and they tend to get far quicker.
[07:49] Um uh but obviously Bitcoin is a whole
[07:51] another beast and there's also a huge
[07:54] network effect in in the fiat
[07:55] currencies. How how big of a thing is
[07:58] that actually that that people have the
[08:00] network effect within fiat and kind of
[08:02] that slowing down adoption for Bitcoin
[08:04] even? So I think that's particularly a
[08:08] problem or a challenge for Bitcoin
[08:11] payments. So if we look for example at
[08:14] cards, credit cards and debit cards,
[08:16] they started in the
[08:18] 1950s. They did not go mainstream until
[08:22] the 2000s. So for 50 years they slowly
[08:27] built up network effect and it was a
[08:29] better technology than checks or than
[08:31] cash even, right? Controversial but
[08:34] better technology. Um and so uh now
[08:39] there's actually if you look at the Visa
[08:41] and Mastercard networks, there's
[08:44] government regulations about how much
[08:46] money they can charge because they are
[08:48] essentially natural monopolies because
[08:50] of their network effects on payments. So
[08:53] I think that that is um if we look at
[08:56] lightning or you know Bitcoin
[08:58] transactions, I do think that the the
[09:00] payments story will happen. it's just
[09:02] going to happen perhaps even more slowly
[09:04] than the store of value uh adoption of
[09:07] Bitcoin. Now, the store of value
[09:09] adoption, I think the network effects
[09:11] there are a lot easier uh because you
[09:14] can actually um join the Bitcoin network
[09:18] almost in isolation, right? Nobody else
[09:20] in your neighborhood has to adopt
[09:21] Bitcoin as a store of value for you to
[09:23] do that. Um, you just have to find other
[09:26] people on the internet uh who are also
[09:28] interested in adopting that as a store
[09:30] of value and then have exchanges where
[09:33] you can actually be able to access
[09:35] liquidity into your local currency so
[09:38] that you're not dependent on having a
[09:40] local network. Absolutely. Yeah. Because
[09:42] you you need if if you want to be on a
[09:44] Bitcoin standard and and get payments,
[09:46] you need an employer who pays you or
[09:48] have some workaround where you get fiat
[09:50] payment. But that's the same as buying
[09:52] from me. is not really getting Bitcoin.
[09:54] Um that that's that's very
[09:57] true. One question I I wanted to go in a
[10:00] different route, but it's very
[10:01] interesting. Um why do you think it's so
[10:03] perfectly aligned those those cycles
[10:04] with like buying and and and selling
[10:06] with that uh um mining cycle and with
[10:10] this four year cycle of like three years
[10:12] up and one year down. Uh and every year
[10:15] there's this talk about super cycles.
[10:17] breaking it finally, but it seems like
[10:19] it's just like a perfect working machine
[10:21] and it's never breaking. Yeah, that's a
[10:24] great question. I do think that
[10:26] historically we could argue that the
[10:28] havingss have had a triggering effect,
[10:32] just supply and demand, right? That we
[10:34] cut supply in half of new coins coming
[10:37] onto the market and then that kind of
[10:40] begins the the cycle. Um, and then if if
[10:45] that's the case going forward, as the
[10:48] havingings become a smaller and smaller
[10:50] percentage of Bitcoin's total supply, we
[10:53] could expect that trend to break down.
[10:56] And so if we look at other markets,
[10:59] other markets tend to have longer cycles
[11:01] like 8 to 12 years, you know, if you
[11:03] look at the stock market and other
[11:04] things like that. Um, so maybe it'll get
[11:08] longer, but it might also just stay
[11:10] short because of human psychology. So
[11:13] humans don't change, right? So um there
[11:16] might be something about literally our
[11:19] brains uh and that fouryear uh uh kind
[11:24] of uh three years and one year you know
[11:26] kind of it it's it takes time to heal
[11:30] the brain or or you know to to cause
[11:32] another uh
[11:35] bullish you know we're we're social
[11:37] animals so uh we end up in having this
[11:40] herd mentality where we all want to do
[11:43] everything at the same time. One of my
[11:45] first jobs I I worked at a supermarket
[11:48] uh and there was an interesting
[11:50] phenomenon that people would come into
[11:52] the store about evenly spread over time,
[11:55] but people would check out from the
[11:57] store in waves and it's because they
[12:00] would notice somebody else checking out
[12:02] and they would think, "Oh, it's time for
[12:04] me to go, too." And then they would go
[12:06] check out. And so you would have you
[12:08] would need to have uh you know people
[12:10] come to help check out uh because of
[12:13] these waves even though people came into
[12:14] the store regularly. And so we're very
[12:16] social animals and that's a good thing,
[12:18] right? We should love our neighbors. Uh
[12:20] but it also causes interesting financial
[12:22] phenomena.
[12:24] I
[12:25] never That's so true. Like there's
[12:28] literally when I go to a supermarket
[12:30] because like I work like I don't have
[12:33] times where I work. So I usually tend to
[12:35] go to a supermarket if it's really
[12:37] empty. So usually I'm the first one to
[12:39] go there and then I have to wait for
[12:40] someone to come there because like
[12:42] there's literally almost nobody else in
[12:43] the supermarket at that time. Um, but
[12:46] when I go late or earlier, I noticed
[12:48] that you just come in and sometimes
[12:51] you're lucky and there's like nobody
[12:52] there and sometimes there's like a huge
[12:55] line. Uh, but there's never a line when
[12:58] when when they coming in. So, it's super
[13:00] interesting. I never thought about So,
[13:02] so you actually observed that. That's
[13:04] that's uh that's an interesting uh thing
[13:07] and I never thought about that. Um,
[13:10] maybe let's come now to the to the
[13:11] nation state thing. Um it's there's so
[13:14] much happening and maybe it would be
[13:16] actually interesting to to hear because
[13:18] you worked at it right and and then you
[13:20] you kind of got the the bad side of that
[13:24] uh there in the backlash also. Um how
[13:27] has in the United States now and I think
[13:31] 50% around of the audience is also from
[13:33] the United States. How has Bitcoin uh
[13:36] developed in the past four years uh or
[13:39] like 3 years, whatever time frame you
[13:40] want to pick in the United States in
[13:43] terms of Bitcoin? Yeah. So, I I think
[13:45] the one event that I would point to as a
[13:48] catalyst and where we could begin is
[13:50] when China banned Bitcoin mining. So
[13:53] when they did that, it caused a lot of
[13:55] Bitcoin mining to move to the United
[13:57] States and that caused it to get on the
[14:01] radar of Elizabeth Horn and other groups
[14:05] that are anti- Bitcoin. Um, also if we
[14:09] look at the litigation against Ripple
[14:13] and XRP, I think that also caused that
[14:17] ecosystem to invest resources into
[14:21] making environmental arguments against
[14:23] Bitcoin in order to uh make XRP look
[14:27] environmentally friendly and thus, you
[14:30] know, the kind of cryptocurrency that
[14:32] the government should not be
[14:33] prosecuting. Um, so th those two factors
[14:37] led to a big uh political push against
[14:40] Bitcoin miners here. Um, and so that's
[14:43] that's why Riot hired me to come in and
[14:46] help with uh setting up a a public
[14:48] policy practice. Uh, so uh first thing I
[14:51] did when I joined was to go and hire a
[14:54] head of public policy in DC, uh, Brian
[14:57] Morgan Stern, who's done a fantastic
[14:59] job. before joining Riot, he was
[15:02] actually working at the previous Trump
[15:04] administration uh in the White House and
[15:06] at the US Treasury. And so he um he he
[15:10] became orange pill because of the
[15:13] Canadian trucker protests. uh he
[15:15] realized you know just like a lot of us
[15:17] did that uh the banking system could be
[15:20] weaponized and that you would want to
[15:22] have something that is a backup an
[15:25] alternative that is decentralized uh
[15:27] that cannot be controlled by
[15:29] corporations and by governments. So um
[15:31] in any case uh he did an excellent job
[15:34] of developing relationships with policy
[15:38] makers uh while you know on me on the
[15:41] research side I would provide kind of
[15:43] the let's say the the the the think the
[15:47] thinking uh behind uh the arguments that
[15:50] we should be making and it really it it
[15:54] was a very multifaceted
[15:56] uh approach because it wasn't just at
[15:59] the federal ederal level that we had
[16:01] push back but also at the state level
[16:02] that there were concerns about Bitcoin
[16:04] mining even here in Texas among policy
[16:07] makers. Um so uh the two two big things
[16:12] happened. One is that the New York Times
[16:14] wrote an article highlighting our uh
[16:18] alleged carbon emissions. Uh so they
[16:20] were trying to make the argument that we
[16:22] were responsible for CO2 emissions which
[16:26] doesn't really make any sense in any
[16:28] other context. Uh so uh for example if
[16:31] we look at the Montrealic cord for uh
[16:35] the ozone layer right the ozone layer
[16:37] was getting a hole in it because of
[16:40] CFC's and so uh the Montrealic cord said
[16:44] okay no more direct emission of CFC's
[16:47] and they banned CFC's and now the ozone
[16:50] layer is fixed now there's no hole and
[16:53] so uh that actually worked they decided
[16:56] to take a very different approach with
[16:58] carbon emissions of saying we're not
[17:00] interested so much in the direct carbon
[17:02] emissions, we're interested in the
[17:04] indirect carbon emissions. So what you
[17:07] who is consuming electricity that is
[17:09] causing a natural gas plant to turn on.
[17:11] Um which doesn't make any sense because
[17:14] you're not actually solving the problem.
[17:16] You're just trying to politicize
[17:17] different industries. I I went out to
[17:20] our facility in Rockdale with a CO2
[17:23] meter and made a a bit of a funny video
[17:26] for the New York Times. uh showing that
[17:29] we didn't have any carbon emissions uh
[17:31] at our Bitcoin mining facility. We're
[17:33] fully electrified uh and so it was uh
[17:36] kind of a a red herring. Now, when they
[17:40] posted the New York Times article on
[17:42] Twitter, the company replied with that
[17:45] video and something amazing happened,
[17:48] which is that we were able to ratio the
[17:51] video. So, we had more likes, more
[17:53] retweets, more views on the video than
[17:56] they did on their in-depth uh quote
[18:00] unquote uh investigative reporting. So,
[18:03] um it really transformed the it
[18:07] transformed the field of crisis
[18:08] communication first of all because
[18:10] people always thought, oh, journalists,
[18:12] you know, we got to be afraid of
[18:13] journalists. No, we shouldn't be afraid
[18:15] of journalists. We should make fun of
[18:17] journalists. we should ridicule them
[18:18] because uh you know when they write
[18:20] things that are completely idiotic that
[18:22] needs to be called out people understand
[18:24] the truth we should speak the truth. Um
[18:26] so there that's one and then second on
[18:29] Bitcoin mining we should stop explaining
[18:32] in politics there's a very important
[18:35] saying if you are explaining you are
[18:38] losing right so if you're explaining oh
[18:42] actually uh you know Bitcoin mining is
[18:44] 50% renewable because we're using wind
[18:47] and solar and you've already lost the
[18:50] argument. So instead what we did is make
[18:54] them explain, oh actually we're not
[18:57] talking about direct emissions of
[18:59] carbon. We're talking about indirect
[19:02] emissions which come through the
[19:04] electrical grid. And so you know it
[19:06] really changed the approach that we have
[19:10] in terms of communicating about Bitcoin
[19:12] mining uh to be less defensive and more
[19:15] offensive. Uh that this is just like an
[19:18] electric car. This is an electric
[19:20] computer. it's not uh it's not a gas
[19:22] powered uh you know uh computer. So uh
[19:26] that that was one and two was I think
[19:30] perhaps even more important talking
[19:32] about the value of Bitcoin because
[19:35] ultimately if Bitcoin has zero value and
[19:39] it's just beanie babies and tulips then
[19:43] any amount of resource consumption for
[19:45] Bitcoin is wasteful. So even if it's
[19:47] even if it's fine for the environment,
[19:49] it's still a waste of resources to to be
[19:51] Bitcoin mining uh if Bitcoin has no
[19:53] value. And so we really emphasized in
[19:57] all of our conversations with policy
[19:59] makers and all of our communications
[20:01] with the public highlighting the value
[20:04] of having a decentralized monetary
[20:06] system and that the only way to achieve
[20:08] that value and to secure it is with
[20:11] Bitcoin mining. So I think that we were
[20:15] so effective in doing that uh that we
[20:18] actually persuaded politicians that they
[20:21] should buy Bitcoin. Uh and so it really
[20:25] we were more successful than we could
[20:27] have ever dreamed of and we moved the
[20:29] Overton window so far in a pro Bitcoin
[20:33] direction that then in July of last
[20:36] year, Trump announced we're going to
[20:38] have a national stockpile of Bitcoin. uh
[20:41] and and he's followed through on that
[20:43] campaign promise. So, uh I think going
[20:46] forward uh now at the state level in
[20:49] Texas also the case that the politicians
[20:53] that were concerned about Bitcoin mining
[20:56] last cycle because the Texas legislature
[20:58] meets every two years. Two years ago,
[21:01] they were saying, "Oh, we don't like
[21:02] Bitcoin mining." Now, they're saying,
[21:04] "We love Bitcoin. Let's buy Bitcoin." Uh
[21:06] and so they're setting up a Texas uh
[21:09] strategic uh reserve of Bitcoin and I
[21:12] think that's actually that bill is going
[21:14] to pass is is my current uh you know
[21:16] assessment of it. Um it has passed the
[21:19] state senate. Uh I I had the honor of
[21:22] going to the state senate and testifying
[21:25] in favor of the bill uh to kind of
[21:27] explain uh why I think it's a good idea.
[21:30] Uh so um I think that it's it's really
[21:34] if we were to point to why Bitcoin has
[21:37] become so successful in US politics,
[21:40] it's really because Elizabeth Warren
[21:42] decided to attack it. It was
[21:43] anti-fragile.
[21:46] that that I love the ending here because
[21:49] it's like you you make it um stronger
[21:52] with every attack uh because the attack
[21:56] uh has a response and the response is
[21:58] then it makes it better is uh just
[22:00] quickly is the Elizabeth Warren and the
[22:03] other groups that are against Bitcoin is
[22:05] that just because as you said funded by
[22:08] Ripple or is there some other agenda
[22:11] they they they have or are they actually
[22:13] worried about the the the environment.
[22:18] So, uh I I think the the root of it is
[22:21] that they subscribe to an ideology
[22:23] called chartism. So, chartism says that
[22:27] the state should have a monopoly on the
[22:30] issuance of currency
[22:33] uh and that way the state can control
[22:36] the economy. Um so, I think that's the
[22:39] root of it.
[22:40] Now they know that they cannot go and
[22:44] make that argument in public because it
[22:47] sounds bad. It just, you know, it just
[22:50] it it sounds awful. Uh and uh it's not
[22:53] popular at all. In fact, it's really
[22:56] unpopular. So they have to find other
[23:00] indirect critiques of Bitcoin, of the
[23:03] environment, of terrorism, criminals
[23:07] using it, drugs, you know, all these
[23:10] things. Uh because they can't make the
[23:12] intellectually honest argument that they
[23:14] want power and control over others.
[23:17] That's a it's a good one. Yeah. It's
[23:19] also
[23:21] like like if if if uh No, no, let's not
[23:25] go there.
[23:27] Um but it's super interesting when when
[23:29] you see uh the the political um movement
[23:34] and if they are against it or for it and
[23:36] and why that how do you look actually
[23:38] outside of the state especially now in
[23:41] the EU? I'm interested in that because I
[23:43] I live here unfortunately. Uh but uh how
[23:46] do you look at other states? Do are they
[23:48] in the same process where they are right
[23:51] now where maybe America was 2021 2022
[23:55] and they're just lagging behind uh or is
[23:58] there something fundamental different?
[24:00] Do you see also maybe some positive
[24:02] trends towards that in in other in other
[24:05] countries like EU perhaps? Uh I think
[24:08] that they
[24:10] are in a very different frame of mind in
[24:13] the sense that here in the United States
[24:16] if we look within the the Democrat party
[24:18] here uh Elizabeth Warren is her her
[24:22] perspective on Bitcoin is in the
[24:25] minority in the Democratic party. So
[24:28] she's not uh she's not reflective of the
[24:33] left in the United States. uh she so um
[24:37] on the other hand in Europe I do think
[24:39] that she is reflective of even the
[24:43] center and the left uh and some elements
[24:46] of the right as well. Um because on the
[24:48] right in Europe I think that when once
[24:51] we go you know far enough on the right
[24:54] you have people who who do want to have
[24:56] monetary sovereignty and who do reject
[24:58] the idea of having a global currency
[25:01] like Bitcoin. they would rather have a
[25:04] national currency that they control. Uh
[25:07] so I think that it's um the it's a much
[25:11] more difficult situation in Europe in
[25:13] many regards. Um I'm hopeful that by
[25:17] setting a positive example and showing
[25:20] to the rest of the world um the amount
[25:23] of prosperity that Bitcoin brings that
[25:26] that will cause changes in people's
[25:29] mentality. But um I'm not optimistic on
[25:32] Europe. My family left France uh when I
[25:35] was young and so maybe that that shapes
[25:38] my my cynicism on Europe. Um but uh I I
[25:42] hope for the best. I live in Europe and
[25:45] I agree with you.
[25:47] So take take it as as you want. Um uh
[25:51] what is the current state in in America
[25:54] right now? We had the the strategic
[25:56] Bitcoin reserve. We had that crypto
[25:58] meeting where Sailor was but
[25:59] unfortunately didn't speak. Uh we have
[26:02] uh maybe I can quickly show you you're
[26:04] well aware of the side probably uh of
[26:07] Julian who who made that overlook side
[26:09] where you can see the the the bills. I
[26:12] think that's a great side of of like uh
[26:15] seeing what's really going on, how many
[26:17] states actually have already uh bills
[26:19] and and where they are. I don't know how
[26:21] accurate this currently is and how
[26:22] updated it um but what is kind of the
[26:25] the current state of America and then
[26:28] maybe later what do you expect uh for it
[26:31] to come in the in in in this year?
[26:34] So, uh I think that it's it's always
[26:37] going to take longer than we want it to.
[26:40] Um but uh that it is on a a positive
[26:43] trajectory. Um the challenge I think at
[26:46] the federal level is that uh the federal
[26:50] government is in uh financial trouble,
[26:53] right? That it has massive deficits. Uh
[26:57] Doge is trying to find places to cut
[26:59] spending. Um and so they have to find
[27:02] creative ways of acquiring Bitcoin if
[27:05] that's the plan for growing the
[27:08] strategic reserve, which I think it is.
[27:10] Um so there's some interesting proposals
[27:14] around there. Uh one proposal that I put
[27:17] forward was to sell gold. Uh that uh you
[27:20] know we have all this gold in Fort Knox
[27:23] supposedly and uh the price of gold is
[27:26] reaching record highs uh nowadays and so
[27:30] uh it would make sense to to sell gold
[27:31] and to buy Bitcoin. Another idea which
[27:34] is really interesting that I've heard
[27:37] from a number of different people now um
[27:39] and was presented by Andrew Hans in DC
[27:43] last week was uh issuing what are called
[27:46] bit bonds uh bitcoinbacked bonds where
[27:51] uh some percentage of the bond is backed
[27:54] by bitcoin and so the bond holder gets a
[27:57] hybrid instrument that combines the
[28:00] principal protection of a traditional
[28:01] bond with some upside potential for the
[28:06] Bitcoin price uh and and that that would
[28:09] actually lower the interest expense for
[28:12] the US. So save money uh while also
[28:15] providing uh for you know more bitcoin
[28:18] ownership wider bitcoin ownership for
[28:20] people who think that bitcoin is too
[28:22] volatile right uh which is I think uh a
[28:24] lot of people uh when we look at the
[28:26] survey data super interesting of like um
[28:29] how can they acquire bitcoin without uh
[28:32] buying it I mean the it's like they have
[28:34] the money printer kind of yeah that's
[28:37] that's true and I I think that uh
[28:40] ultimately if if if we were to look at
[28:42] it objectively, that's what they should
[28:44] do is that the Federal Reserve should
[28:47] just create lots of dollars and buy up
[28:49] Bitcoin uh and build up a Bitcoin
[28:52] reserve that way. Um, politically that
[28:56] is challenging uh because that is seen
[28:59] as it's seen as inflationary, which I
[29:02] actually I don't think it would be
[29:03] inflationary um if if we kind of uh
[29:07] think through the mechanics of it. Uh
[29:09] but right now it doesn't seem like the
[29:10] Overton window is there yet. We have to
[29:13] keep pushing it, right? Let's take a
[29:15] break for a moment and appreciate the
[29:17] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[29:20] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[29:23] the most amazing, the most eleigent way
[29:26] of showing that you are a true
[29:28] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[29:31] dropped a completely new and amazing
[29:34] Genesis edition of their watch
[29:36] collections. You have the date of the
[29:38] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[29:42] and of course also the block height and
[29:44] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[29:48] the level of detail they put in in this
[29:51] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[29:53] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[29:56] down in the descriptions. I love those
[29:58] watches so so much. And now if you have
[30:02] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[30:04] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[30:06] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[30:08] to deal with that. The first way is you
[30:10] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[30:13] entry for you to get into the
[30:15] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[30:19] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[30:21] super simple and secure way. And if you
[30:24] check out the link in the description,
[30:26] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[30:29] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[30:32] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[30:35] partner in terms of how to get the most
[30:38] out of your sovereignty. They will
[30:41] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[30:44] that is perfect for your individual
[30:47] situation. They will show you how you
[30:49] can secure your own devices. Securing
[30:52] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[30:54] have to keep all your devices secure.
[30:56] One topic that is overlooked often is
[30:58] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:01] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[31:04] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[31:06] place already? And last but not least,
[31:08] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[31:11] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[31:13] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[31:18] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[31:21] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:24] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:26] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:29] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:32] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:34] you there. You can get your ticket in
[31:36] the link down in the description of
[31:38] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[31:41] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[31:44] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[31:46] there. It seems so interesting. I I I
[31:49] searched it but I couldn't find it.
[31:50] There's uh I mean maybe it's just
[31:53] Twitter but uh there's some things where
[31:55] like Jason Lori changes profile picture.
[31:58] Michael Sailor said big things are
[31:59] coming and there's a lot of like those
[32:00] collections uh and and sometimes it's
[32:03] more noise around uh nothing. Um do you
[32:07] know anything is do you expect anything
[32:10] uh that is because I think a lot of
[32:12] people are kind of I don't know if
[32:15] disappointed but a lot of people thought
[32:17] there's more coming like Trump is coming
[32:19] into office and like big things are
[32:21] coming and like strategic Bitcoin
[32:23] reserve and it makes a boom and the
[32:24] price goes up and everything is there.
[32:26] So in in that regard maybe some uh are I
[32:32] I don't know like
[32:33] disappointed from what actually
[32:36] happened. Yeah. Uh well to to them I
[32:39] would say uh enjoy the journey. Uh you
[32:41] know it's the friends we make along the
[32:43] way. Uh because uh this is I think going
[32:47] to take a significant amount of time. Uh
[32:50] and that uh we also we're going to
[32:53] continue to have hype. we're gonna
[32:55] continue to have you know big things are
[32:56] coming and then nothing comes uh and
[33:00] that uh then you know eventually there
[33:03] will be a week where everything changes
[33:05] right you know so it's always um there's
[33:08] there's periods of acceleration um but
[33:11] uh yeah I think that that's that's where
[33:13] I encourage people to explore uh
[33:17] meditation you know spirituality uh so
[33:20] that they can kind of detach from the
[33:21] world we you know this is a fallen
[33:24] world, we're all it's very flawed. Uh
[33:26] and so people have to um go to church. I
[33:30] love that. I I I throw in there one more
[33:33] uh um recommendation. Long walks are
[33:36] amazing. Like in the sun, long walks
[33:38] like 1 hour, two hour walks, get some
[33:40] touch grass. Um, one thing that also is
[33:45] always interesting because like we have
[33:46] those political cycles with four years
[33:49] and and and and Trump coming in before
[33:51] it was like a little bit more hostile
[33:53] with the Biden administration. How deep
[33:56] is that uh pro Bitcoin stands on a
[34:00] federal level uh or maybe also on a
[34:02] state level and how much is depending on
[34:06] yeah Trump administration? Um, I don't
[34:09] think that any
[34:11] Democrats or any politicians in the
[34:14] United States will be able to win if
[34:18] they are not pro Bitcoin at a national
[34:21] level. So, I just I I don't think that
[34:24] it's uh reversible at this point. Um,
[34:29] so on the left it's a huge problem
[34:33] because right now it seems like
[34:36] leadership is being taken by folks who
[34:39] like AOC are Bitcoin skeptics when if
[34:44] they want to win what they need is
[34:47] politicians like Roana who is a Democrat
[34:51] from Silicon Valley who's pro Bitcoin
[34:54] and so they they need that kind of
[34:56] leadership.
[34:58] But it doesn't seem like that's the
[34:59] direction the Democratic Party is going
[35:01] in. I think it's a huge problem. I think
[35:03] that the Democratic Party Well, so what
[35:06] I'll I'll start off with first of all,
[35:08] so I'm a Republican. I'm a conservative.
[35:10] Uh but I also think that it's good to
[35:15] have competition. It's good to have a
[35:17] marketplace of ideas. It's good to have
[35:19] debate. if the other side is so weak and
[35:23] discredited that it's not even effective
[35:27] in entering having the credibility to
[35:30] have those debates. I think that's a
[35:32] problem for the nations. So, um I I
[35:35] think the Democratic party needs to uh
[35:38] fundamentally transform itself and uh
[35:40] avoid getting into the trap of uh lites,
[35:45] right? These are people, they're not
[35:46] just even anti- Bitcoin, they're
[35:47] anti-technology. So they, you know,
[35:50] they're anti-Elon Musk. They're anti-ele
[35:52] electric vehicles now. Uh it's really uh
[35:56] it's it's bizarre to see this happening.
[35:59] Um but
[36:01] um I I think that it reflects their
[36:04] embrace of a particular kind of Marxist
[36:07] ideology which is just unamerican. And
[36:10] so uh they had four years uh to force it
[36:13] onto the country. uh and I think that it
[36:16] was it was rejected uh by the country
[36:18] but they they have to find the pro
[36:21] bitcoin politicians uh to to to win
[36:24] going forward. Uh and they exist. Uh so
[36:28] uh I think that uh there just needs to
[36:30] be more education and more
[36:31] conversations.
[36:33] Do you think the as Trump announced is
[36:36] is now operation choke point 2.0
[36:39] officially over? just like that that's
[36:41] no longer coming or coming back to
[36:43] Bitcoin.
[36:45] Uh I I think that that pendulum could
[36:47] continue to swing. So for example, we
[36:50] could imagine a scenario where um not
[36:53] only do
[36:55] banks help Bitcoin companies
[36:58] transactionally with
[37:00] fiat, banks could also decide that, oh,
[37:04] we're going to lend money against
[37:07] Bitcoin, right? So, we'll do Bitcoin
[37:09] secured lending. Uh, and then if there's
[37:12] a long bare market and those loans go
[37:15] bad, uh, then you could see a situation
[37:18] where the government says, "Okay, you
[37:21] lent too much money against Bitcoin, so
[37:24] we're going to have more restrictions
[37:25] around what banks can do with Bitcoin."
[37:27] So, I could see things moving back and
[37:30] forth on that aspect of it. Um, I don't
[37:34] think that we'll see a situation where
[37:37] it really is that they will not open a
[37:40] bank account if you are a Bitcoin
[37:43] business that is legal. Uh, I think that
[37:45] that that just won't happen again. Um,
[37:49] yeah. So, the the really hostile things
[37:52] are are over, but there can still be uh
[37:54] here and there hiccups that are normal.
[37:56] How how important is it
[37:59] uh knowing all of that? How important is
[38:01] it to as a Bitcoiner be politically
[38:03] active or be um aware of what's going on
[38:08] in in the political scheme? Yeah, I I
[38:10] think it's critical. I I think we we
[38:12] have to be politically active. Um
[38:14] there's this fantasy that um and in
[38:18] fact, you know, I'll hear I'll hear
[38:19] Bitcoiners say that um we should
[38:21] actually be encouraging the state to ban
[38:24] Bitcoin uh and to make it illegal. That
[38:27] way uh we can all be uh on the dark
[38:31] market self- sovereign and there's no uh
[38:35] custodians there's no Wall Street in
[38:37] Bitcoin and it's you know they see that
[38:41] as maximum cipher punk right of uh now
[38:45] now we've really achieved crypto anarchy
[38:48] because it's illegal to use Bitcoin and
[38:51] uh we have to all uh you know fly under
[38:53] the radar. So, I I see that as
[38:56] dystopian. Uh I see that as hell. I
[38:59] mean, uh you know, if you get caught,
[39:02] you go to prison because you were using
[39:03] Bitcoin. Like, why is that why is that a
[39:07] good thing? That seems terrible. So um I
[39:10] think it's it's it's very important to
[39:12] be going in the opposite direction of
[39:15] making sure that it is legal to use
[39:17] Bitcoin uh and that we don't uh end up
[39:20] in a situation where the government is
[39:23] banning Bitcoin. Um so you know when we
[39:26] look at for example with gold people
[39:28] will point to what happened with gold of
[39:30] executive order 6102 that the government
[39:33] seized all the gold and so they use that
[39:36] as an argument for why you should
[39:38] self-custody your Bitcoin and there's
[39:40] some truth to that but ultimately 6102
[39:44] also applied to people self-custodying
[39:46] their Bitcoin u and so the argument that
[39:51] oh well uh I I brought my Bitcoin and
[39:54] it's it's not KYC. I have privacy and so
[39:59] I don't care if the Bitcoin or if the
[40:01] government does 6102 and seizes everyone
[40:04] Bitcoin, they won't get mine. Okay,
[40:07] sure. And then what? And then what do
[40:09] you do? You just sit on you sit on your
[40:12] Bitcoin, you know, like you just buy
[40:14] drugs on the black market with your
[40:16] Bitcoin. It's all you can do. Uh and so
[40:19] it really limits the freedom that you
[40:22] have, right? and we're all here for the
[40:24] freedom. Uh so I think that if we're not
[40:27] politically engaged uh we enter into a
[40:31] nihilistic trap of uh thinking that uh
[40:36] you know oh because Bitcoin we don't
[40:38] have to care about politics. The I think
[40:41] the opposite is true. I think because of
[40:43] Bitcoin we should care about politics
[40:45] even more because we can win. before
[40:49] Bitcoin there's an argument that you
[40:51] shouldn't care about politics because
[40:52] you can't win and now I think we can win
[40:55] and so um and and the proof is that we
[40:59] have been winning and that we've been
[41:01] winning far more than I would have ever
[41:03] expected uh so for example on on the
[41:06] Bitcoin mining side um the the the the
[41:10] government said all the bitcoin miners
[41:14] this is this is uh last year the
[41:16] government said all the bitcoin miners
[41:17] ers have to provide the information
[41:21] about who is selling them electricity.
[41:23] So why did Elizabeth Horn want this
[41:26] information so that then activists can
[41:30] go to energy companies and say stop
[41:32] selling electricity to Bitcoin miners
[41:35] you know otherwise we're going to uh you
[41:38] know uh boycott you or make fun of you
[41:42] for not doing ESG or whatever. So they
[41:44] wanted activists to go cancel the
[41:46] electricity companies that are selling
[41:48] electricity to Bitcoin miners. Um and so
[41:51] they they tried to get all that
[41:53] information through the Department of
[41:55] Energy. So the Department of Energy sent
[41:57] out a survey to all the Bitcoin miners.
[42:00] So we had two options or let's say three
[42:03] options. Uh one option is to just comply
[42:06] send provide our response of okay here's
[42:10] you know our our energy contractors. Uh
[42:13] the second option would be uh we don't
[42:16] comply we break the law we go to jail
[42:19] for not providing that information. The
[42:23] third option is that we engage in the
[42:26] policym process through litigation by
[42:29] suing the government. And so that's what
[42:32] we did. We took the government to court
[42:35] in federal court. We went in front of a
[42:37] judge and we explained why they were
[42:40] what they were doing was illegal and the
[42:42] federal judge agreed with us and told
[42:45] them to knock it off. Uh and so we won
[42:48] in court, right? So we can win by
[42:51] engaging in the process. We don't have
[42:53] to like break the law or just simply
[42:56] comply. There's a third option of
[42:58] fighting and we can win by fighting. So,
[43:01] um I think that uh that is why it is so
[43:04] crucial uh for Bitcoiners to to be
[43:07] involved in the political process. We
[43:10] live in democracies, right? They're not
[43:12] perfect, but we're not in communist
[43:14] China where you know, oh, the there's a
[43:17] dictator and you if you if you go and
[43:20] you try to argue against what they're
[43:22] doing, they'll put you in a camp, you
[43:24] know, uh they'll they'll send you to
[43:27] Siberia. uh that's not the country we
[43:29] live in here in the United States at
[43:30] least it's not uh and so that's that's
[43:33] why I think it is important to be
[43:34] involved in
[43:35] politics that's super important points
[43:39] it's also I would just add to that um
[43:42] uh because a lot of people say oh I
[43:45] don't care about politics Bitcoin
[43:46] doesn't care about politics Bitcoin is
[43:49] true like Bitcoin doesn't care
[43:51] themselves as of of politics but you are
[43:54] still like a a human being in a
[43:56] jurisdiction
[43:57] and politics definitely cares about you
[43:59] and and as long as they especially as if
[44:02] they have monopoly on
[44:04] violence you don't want to be on the bad
[44:07] side and I also I always see politics as
[44:10] kind of the space where we agree on how
[44:13] we live together uh so it's from from a
[44:17] even outside of Bitcoin it's a natural
[44:19] thing of like you you want to bring
[44:22] especially if you feel not well
[44:24] presented you want to give your input in
[44:28] there. So I think uh it's very important
[44:30] to to give like political input uh as
[44:34] much as possible. Uh but also not be I
[44:37] mean there's this this thing of like
[44:39] being distracted by politics. Uh but if
[44:41] you put like your your your fight in
[44:44] there, I think it's it's a very good
[44:46] thing in general to do. How well do you
[44:49] think we are currently presented in in
[44:52] in politics uh with with Bitcoin? Yeah.
[44:55] So um this actually ties to something
[44:58] that that you just said which is that um
[45:00] you know this idea that that Bitcoin
[45:02] doesn't care about politics that's
[45:04] actually why it is so mo so powerful in
[45:07] politics right so in any kind of
[45:10] negotiation it comes down to what
[45:13] happens if I walk away what what is and
[45:18] and in in negotiation they call this the
[45:19] BATNA the best alternative to a
[45:22] negotiated agreement and so when we talk
[45:25] about Bitcoin with politicians and if a
[45:27] politician says I'm going to ban Bitcoin
[45:31] then we as Bitcoiners can truthfully
[45:34] respond with if you do that all you are
[45:38] doing is banning yourself from Bitcoin
[45:41] and Bitcoin will thrive abroad in other
[45:45] countries so you have accomplished
[45:47] nothing so let's go back to the
[45:50] negotiating table right and so it's
[45:52] always the ability to opt out to walk
[45:56] away. That gives us the leverage to
[45:59] negotiate. If we were desperate and we
[46:02] thought, well, oh no, if they ban
[46:05] Bitcoin, it's over. Bitcoin's dead. If
[46:08] they ban Bitcoin, then we have zero
[46:11] leverage and then they can actually ban
[46:13] Bitcoin, right? And so that's I think
[46:15] the paradox. Um now, uh when it comes to
[46:19] how well is Bitcoin represented in
[46:21] politics, uh I think I think that we
[46:25] have great representation in some
[46:28] regards. In other regards, there's a lot
[46:30] of confusion. And so, you know, there's
[46:33] confusion about Bitcoin versus crypto
[46:37] uh and all these tokens and the value of
[46:42] blockchain technology versus the value
[46:44] of Bitcoin. But this is the kind of
[46:47] confusion that can only be addressed by
[46:50] a strategic Bitcoin reserve because it
[46:53] forces that
[46:54] conversation. And when we had that
[46:57] conversation here in the United States,
[47:00] you know, ultimately the result was,
[47:03] okay, we're going to separate strategic
[47:06] Bitcoin reserve and national crypto
[47:10] stockpile. And so that was the result of
[47:13] the negotiation was that we have in the
[47:17] United States at a federal level
[47:20] separated Bitcoin from crypto and the
[47:23] executive order said we're going to buy
[47:26] Bitcoin, we're going to sell crypto. And
[47:29] so I think that in that regard the
[47:32] confusion has been lifted uh for now and
[47:36] that we have a lot of clarity and great
[47:38] representation for Bitcoin.
[47:40] That's amazing. And I think the the
[47:42] separation between Bitcoin and crypto is
[47:45] probably one of the most important
[47:47] things that you can communicate to to
[47:49] non- Bitcoiners out there.
[47:52] And in in the altcoin space for me is
[47:56] just like companies that want to lobby.
[47:59] How much does that influence the the
[48:03] Bitcoin lobbying or the Bitcoin politics
[48:05] because those central companies maybe
[48:08] can more effectively work or more
[48:11] coordinated work because like Bitcoin
[48:13] there's no CEO of Bitcoin, there's no
[48:15] coordinated marketing or like department
[48:17] or stuff like that. How how much is that
[48:19] a a trend that you're seeing where like
[48:21] Ripple or like other altcoins just have
[48:24] budgets and have teams that they send in
[48:26] to politics? Yeah. So I think that um
[48:31] what influences politicians is is the
[48:34] intersection of three factors. Uh one is
[48:38] for any given policy um how many votes
[48:41] do I gain and how many votes do I lose
[48:44] in the next
[48:45] election. Two is how much money can I
[48:48] fund raise by supporting this issue? And
[48:52] then three is it good policy? Is it good
[48:55] for the country? Right? And so it's it's
[48:57] along those three axes where you need to
[48:59] have alignment in order to move policy
[49:03] forward. Along those three factors uh
[49:06] that the other
[49:08] cryptocurrencies they can provide the
[49:11] second one right which is they provide
[49:13] lots of funding and that uh politicians
[49:17] they want to have a big war chest. They
[49:19] want to be able to advertise and to uh
[49:22] get their messaging out. Um, but they
[49:24] don't have the other two. Uh, they don't
[49:27] have incremental voters. So, as a
[49:30] politician, all you have to do to get
[49:32] the crypto voter is to say that you're
[49:35] pro Bitcoin. That already secures their
[49:37] vote. You don't have to say that you're
[49:39] also pro Cardano, pro XRP, pro uh,
[49:43] Ethereum, pro Salana, right? Like, it's
[49:47] already taken care of. The voter has
[49:49] already made their decision. If you say
[49:50] I'm pro Bitcoin, even if they are 100%
[49:54] XRP,
[49:56] uh they understand that if the
[49:58] politician is pro Bitcoin, that's
[50:00] actually good for XRP from a political
[50:02] perspective. Maybe not from an economic
[50:04] perspective, but from a political one.
[50:06] Um because on the other side, you have
[50:08] an anti- Bitcoin politician who is
[50:11] anti-XRP, right? So, it's not like
[50:13] there's, oh, I'm gonna vote for this guy
[50:16] because, uh, you know, the other guy's
[50:18] pro Bitcoin, so I'm gonna vote for this
[50:20] other politician who's anti-XRP. Um,
[50:22] that doesn't So, and then on the third
[50:26] part of policy, they understand that
[50:29] good policy is being pro Bitcoin. Um, so
[50:32] I think that ultimately what what the
[50:35] money gets the uh the the
[50:39] altcoiners is that they get access. So
[50:42] they get to get their picture taken with
[50:44] a politician. They might have dinner
[50:47] with that politician. And so they can
[50:49] create an appearance of influence but
[50:53] without the actual influence. And so,
[50:56] uh, it's it's a, you know, maybe that
[50:59] makes sense for them because they're
[51:01] actually there for marketing, right? So,
[51:03] they're trying to, uh, they they they
[51:06] the reason why they want to take a
[51:07] picture with Donald Trump is so that
[51:11] more people buy XRP, right? It's not
[51:14] even so that they can influence Donald
[51:15] Trump. It's so that they can post the
[51:17] picture on social media and provide the
[51:20] appearance of, oh, we're in, uh, you
[51:23] know, a good relationship with the
[51:25] politician. Uh, and it doesn't have to
[51:28] be necessarily true. It can, you know,
[51:30] they're just going for the hype. That's
[51:32] the the the appearance of it. It's it's
[51:35] it's so fascinating the intersection
[51:37] with with Bitcoin politics. Um, yeah,
[51:40] really cool. Would you say um that
[51:44] Bitcoin is on the right side or like
[51:46] Republican side uh currently more? I
[51:49] know in the election there was also like
[51:51] a group of like Harris for Bitcoiners or
[51:53] Bitcoin for Harris or something like
[51:54] that. Uh so there are probably some uh a
[51:58] good amount of Bitcoiners also on the
[51:59] Democrat side. But is is Bitcoin
[52:02] currently more on on on the Republican
[52:05] side? I think it really it depends.
[52:09] Um, within the party
[52:12] apparatus of the actual Republican party
[52:15] and the Democrat party, um, they have
[52:19] what's called a a party platform, which
[52:21] is kind of the official views of the
[52:23] political party. Uh, and the Republican
[52:26] party has an official pro bitcoin policy
[52:30] plank on their platform. The Democrat
[52:33] party does not. uh and so just looking
[52:37] at it objectively with regard to that I
[52:40] think that it is more Republican today.
[52:42] Now if we look at it through the lens of
[52:46] uh you know should Democrats have a pro
[52:49] Bitcoin policy I think they should I
[52:51] think it should be bipartisan. I think
[52:53] it should be nonpartisan. Um and so I
[52:56] think Bitcoin should have universal
[52:58] appeal. Um, it's just that as long as
[53:02] the Democrat party is controlled by the
[53:06] progressive charterists who are opposed
[53:10] to currency competition and who want to
[53:13] control the economy um, and are
[53:17] anti-arkets, then that's it's just it's
[53:20] not going to mix uh, with with Bitcoin.
[53:24] um what what they need to move towards
[53:27] and I think this is a huge this is the
[53:29] biggest opportunity for the Democratic
[53:30] party is that they need to position
[53:33] themselves as um on the Republican side
[53:39] they are free market so that means that
[53:42] they they're for memecoins you know all
[53:45] of the all the cryptos all of this on
[53:48] the Democrat party what they should say
[53:50] is that they are for consumer protection
[53:53] and that they want to have the uh actual
[53:58] you know utility of crypto without the
[54:01] speculation.
[54:03] uh and so they are for for example let's
[54:05] say lightning right and and they might
[54:08] say that um you know they want to they
[54:12] want lightning to be competing with Visa
[54:14] and Mastercard and so they could find
[54:17] policy directions that they could go in
[54:20] that would actually lean into their
[54:22] strengths of being democratic of
[54:26] empowering people of you know helping
[54:30] the little guy against the corporation
[54:33] of balancing
[54:34] injustices. And so that's what they
[54:37] should be focused on rather than saying,
[54:40] "Oh, we don't like Bitcoin because it's
[54:44] not backed by the government."
[54:45] Interesting. I I like the um uh I like
[54:50] to see where where Bitcoin is currently
[54:52] going in in in the political spectrum.
[54:54] It's also interesting uh because America
[54:56] has basically two parties uh and and and
[54:59] for example Austria and also like many
[55:01] other countries have like three four
[55:03] sometimes like five and it's super
[55:05] interesting which ones are kind of for
[55:07] Bitcoin and which ones against and I see
[55:10] always the socialist green left parties
[55:13] are usually against it. uh even though
[55:16] some are like a little bit more open to
[55:19] it and more the conservative um or the
[55:24] economic liberals are a little bit more
[55:26] open to innovation and stuff like that.
[55:28] It's super interesting to to uh observe
[55:31] that. Um my last question uh uh my last
[55:35] topic for today would be game theory. Um
[55:38] with America now publicly saying
[55:42] strategic Bitcoin reserve what is the
[55:45] implication long-term for for China,
[55:49] South Korea, um EU, India and all of
[55:53] them now seeing that the a world
[55:57] superpower like America is now openly
[56:00] talking about strategic Bitcoin reserve
[56:03] and doing that. Um, I think that it's
[56:06] it's probably along two lines. One is
[56:09] that they do see Trump as being an
[56:11] unconventional thinker. And so to them,
[56:16] you know, it's probably the case that
[56:18] they want to wait and see uh if this is
[56:22] uh just a a good idea or not.
[56:26] Um but on the other hand, I think that
[56:29] the more forwardthinking ones are seeing
[56:31] that um it's not just Trump, right?
[56:34] It's, you know, Boulli and El Salvador.
[56:37] Uh it's Michael Sailor. Uh it's uh
[56:41] Bhutan. And that this is how things
[56:45] begin is they start small. Uh you know,
[56:48] we we like to think that Bitcoin's
[56:50] already big because Bitcoin's already
[56:51] like worth more than a trillion dollars
[56:53] in market cap. But globally, Bitcoin is
[56:55] still pretty small. Uh and and uh that
[56:59] uh so I think that it's still very early
[57:01] over there. Um but when it breaks
[57:04] through that they're going to really,
[57:06] you know, go in heavy like everyone
[57:09] else.
[57:10] Absolutely. That's an interesting one
[57:12] also that uh because it it was a little
[57:15] bit like um I think Tesla when they
[57:18] first adopted Bitcoin on the balance
[57:20] sheet. Uh it maybe it's similar to that
[57:22] where Tesla is a huge company. Uh but
[57:26] firstly they didn't buy that many. I
[57:28] mean 10,000 bitcoin is a lot but uh it's
[57:31] for for Tesla not that much. Um and also
[57:34] Elen is always seen as an unconventional
[57:37] guy as if Amazon or Apple or Microsoft
[57:41] would buy like 10% worth of the balance
[57:43] sheet of Bitcoin. It's a whole different
[57:46] thing. So maybe uh if if the next
[57:49] president a different one uh because
[57:51] yeah Trump I think yeah Trump obviously
[57:54] has no second term because he's already
[57:56] second term um uh also hasn't he cannot
[58:01] ride uh well JD Vance I think uh you
[58:04] know as vice president is in potentially
[58:07] the best position to continue his
[58:10] policies and and JD Vance is pro Bitcoin
[58:13] so we could see you know for the next 12
[58:16] years. Uh pro Bitcoin policy in the
[58:19] United States. It's it's actually
[58:20] interesting because like uh I I've seen
[58:23] the trend that the vice president is
[58:25] then the next pres president is like or
[58:29] is that kind of like uh in formal law in
[58:33] in America? Uh it's it's very informal.
[58:37] So um I expect that there will still be
[58:40] a primary. Um, but usually the president
[58:44] is either the former vice president, the
[58:48] former secretary of state, for example,
[58:50] Hillary Hillary Clinton, or, uh, the
[58:52] former senator like, uh, Barack Obama.
[58:55] And so, uh, those are kind of the three
[58:58] areas where we see, but as long as JD
[59:02] Vance does a great job as vice
[59:03] president, and I think that he's off to
[59:05] a great start, uh, I think that he's the
[59:07] favorite. Absolutely. And I um I was
[59:11] listening to an interview of him and I I
[59:14] really like this guy. Like Chile Vance
[59:15] has a lot of great opinions of him like
[59:18] he would be amazing president I think.
[59:20] Uh but one question that I ask each and
[59:22] every one of my guests is what can we
[59:24] learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[59:28] Um well I'm I I am really into religion.
[59:31] Uh I'm a Catholic myself. So uh that's
[59:35] the you know it's more important to me
[59:37] than Bitcoin is. Uh and uh that's uh so
[59:40] so my faith is the other thing other
[59:42] than Bitcoin.
[59:44] Really cool. We have a endotin in the
[59:46] podcast by the way that it it's
[59:48] fascinating how often religion comes up
[59:51] at that question. Um we have entertain
[59:53] in the podcast where the previous guest
[59:55] is asking a question for the next guest
[59:56] without knowing who the next guest
[59:58] actually is. Is a question uh you can
[60:00] interpret it as as as uh as as you want.
[60:03] The question for you is how many years
[60:06] do you think Bitcoin will run for? Oh
[60:08] wow. Um so I will interpret it as first
[60:11] of all Bitcoin has been running since uh
[60:14] Hal Finny tweeted uh running Bitcoin
[60:16] back in 2009. Um and so you know we're
[60:20] we're into a 16-year bull market. Uh and
[60:24] I think that this bull market will
[60:26] continue uh forever. I mean I that's you
[60:29] know when we think about the
[60:31] productivity of humanity uh combined
[60:34] with the um people it's going to take a
[60:38] really long time for people to get to
[60:40] that 100% allocation right uh Bitcoin
[60:44] maxis were like yeah we're all in you
[60:46] know we we sold our chairs uh so we're
[60:49] 100% um if we look at the wider world
[60:53] we're at like less than 0.01% 01% of
[60:56] global wealth uh if you include all
[60:59] assets uh and that all assets is going
[61:02] to continue to grow and so you know
[61:05] while Bitcoin's growing the whole
[61:07] economy is growing as well. Uh, so I
[61:09] think that when we're trying to figure
[61:11] out what's the price of Bitcoin going to
[61:13] be at at the very, you know, we're going
[61:16] to get to a point where it's like one
[61:18] Bitcoin equals one or sorry, one one SAT
[61:21] equals one Satoshi, right? Where uh
[61:23] that's a hund00 million per bitcoin. Um,
[61:26] and that's going to take many many
[61:28] decades to get there, but I think it
[61:30] will happen. I love that. really cool
[61:32] that we are we and it's also the uh yeah
[61:34] usually my answer if if someone ask me
[61:37] if if this cycle is a super cycle I'm
[61:39] like yeah we we are in a super cycle
[61:41] since 2009. Yeah, that's that that No,
[61:44] that's exactly that's exactly it.
[61:48] Really cool. Um, before I let you go,
[61:51] um, where can people find you, ask you
[61:52] questions, and and and reach out to you?
[61:54] Yeah. So, uh, well, my next question for
[61:56] your next guest is, uh, what are your 12
[62:00] seedwords? Um, so you can find me, uh,
[62:03] Bitcoin Pierre on Twitter
[62:06] or, uh, Pier Roshard on LinkedIn and
[62:09] just double check to make sure it's not
[62:10] an impersonator.
[62:12] Yeah, always double check for the blue
[62:14] check mark or like even sometimes they
[62:16] have the blue check mark. I I saw some
[62:18] other Robin with a blue check mark which
[62:20] was really frightening for me. But yeah,
[62:22] um uh what are your 12 uh seeds? I will
[62:26] I will ask them. I think 24. Yeah,
[62:30] I can give you the first 12. Yeah. Yeah.
[62:33] Uh thank you so much for being on. It
[62:35] was a lot of fun and it was also really
[62:37] informative. I think it was a great
