[00:00] now what we're seeing is people wanting
[00:01] to retire soon and you know maybe they
[00:04] have 20% to 100% Bitcoin and so they're
[00:06] thinking through a retirement plan that
[00:08] is heavily Bitcoin dependent there's a
[00:10] lot of pitfalls that we can run into
[00:12] arguably more considerations than people
[00:14] who don't own Bitcoin because of the
[00:15] volatility you know I always encourage
[00:17] bitcoiners you know even if if you're
[00:19] like listening to this and you're like
[00:20] ah this guy is a Fiat guy you're
[00:22] thinking that you know let's just have a
[00:24] conversation if you can't beat the
[00:26] Bitcoin you know compounded annual
[00:28] return you know you should just buy
[00:29] Bitcoin coin and not worry about
[00:31] investing in anything else but
[00:32] eventually when we reach you know a mass
[00:34] adoption hopefully uh with Bitcoin you
[00:36] know that hurdle rate will come down
[00:38] quite a bit and people will still want
[00:40] to invest their money in some capacity
[00:42] you know when you're 100% Bitcoin or
[00:44] proxies micro strategy you know miners
[00:47] whatever it may be you're riding this
[00:49] roller coaster and so if you get those
[00:51] you know initial years wrong there's
[00:53] potentially you could be spending down
[00:55] your stack very quickly and now you've
[00:57] put yourself at risk of having to brush
[00:59] up your res you can also leverage when
[01:02] maybe Bitcoin is down you know in a bare
[01:04] Market if we continue to see the cycles
[01:06] that we've seen your family can continue
[01:08] to benefit from this incredible
[01:10] generational asset that that we now have
[01:13] in
[01:19] Bitcoin you're the third uh how how do
[01:22] you call CFB like the financial planner
[01:24] like someone that actually has a license
[01:26] to talk about Bitcoin and talk about
[01:28] Finance uh on my podcast so like in
[01:31] around 400 people uh three of them had a
[01:34] license to do that uh thank you so much
[01:36] for coming on the show um the last cfp
[01:40] asked okay why are there not so many
[01:44] financial planners in Bitcoin but it
[01:46] seems to they're getting more it feels
[01:49] like yeah oh absolutely it's there's a
[01:51] very small subset of us uh in the United
[01:54] States and uh we're all a part of a
[01:56] similar Network it's Bitcoin financial
[01:58] advisor Network um so you know we're
[02:00] we're regularly talking helping each
[02:01] other out but yeah I mean it hasn't
[02:03] necessarily permeated the the financial
[02:05] advisor industry at large I mean um you
[02:08] know it's it's there's still a Fiat
[02:11] mindset you know that is very ingrained
[02:14] um in financial advice within the United
[02:17] States and it takes a lot to overcome
[02:20] you know how things have always been for
[02:22] you know a hundred years or so um so we
[02:26] we'll see uh you know how that continues
[02:28] to grow but I expect that you know more
[02:31] and more financial planners will come
[02:33] around to bitcoin and understand how
[02:35] valuable that can be for you know a
[02:38] personal financial situation interesting
[02:40] what what what do you think are the
[02:41] challenges for them to cross Bitcoin is
[02:45] it just like they they they're not
[02:48] seeing it or they are dismissing it as
[02:51] like risky and like highly speculative
[02:53] like like they are they're the ones with
[02:56] the license that should educate
[02:58] themselves the most uh so like they they
[03:01] should understand it the fasters it
[03:03] seems like well you know I'll approach
[03:07] you maybe from two ways they should be
[03:09] educating themselves for sure whenever I
[03:11] first started this business strong
[03:12] wealth um you know it was 2020 2021 time
[03:16] frame that's when I also came to bitcoin
[03:18] uh to come to understand Bitcoin and we
[03:21] were in the middle of that bull market
[03:22] and I asked myself you know if I'm going
[03:24] to be advising people on their finances
[03:26] I should know what this is so I spent
[03:29] the time the due diligence um you know
[03:31] listening to to sailor podcasts and
[03:34] breed love and reading the Bitcoin
[03:35] standard and you know all of those great
[03:37] resources that those guys have put out
[03:39] um and you know it changed how I viewed
[03:42] Financial advice fundamentally it
[03:44] changed how I viewed the financial
[03:45] system fundamentally um so I do believe
[03:47] that it is the obligation of fiduciary
[03:50] financial planners to do their due
[03:52] diligence um however you know whenever
[03:55] you have gone through so many years of
[03:57] one education on Keynesian economics I
[04:00] you know Fiat money system um you
[04:03] believe that that is just what is best
[04:06] or that you know just because that's
[04:08] what it is you don't question the
[04:09] fundamental premise of it um and so when
[04:12] you've been ingrained in that system
[04:14] it's worked really well for you you know
[04:16] as a financial for someone giving
[04:17] Financial advice to others um you know
[04:20] it's it's easy to just say well I I
[04:23] don't need that I'm already good with
[04:24] everything I've been doing for the past
[04:26] five 10 20 years um and so it's it's
[04:30] quick and easy to dismiss it and uh I
[04:33] think that will be to the detriment of
[04:35] many traditional you know Normy if you
[04:38] will financial planners over the next
[04:40] five to 10 years because Bitcoin is
[04:42] really going to disrupt um and kind of
[04:45] turn the financial system on its head uh
[04:48] for sure so we'll see how it plays out
[04:51] but um you
[04:52] know outside of that I think there's an
[04:54] ego part of it too uh you know Bitcoin
[04:57] is an ego test at the end of the day a
[04:59] lot of people you know you've heard that
[05:01] from a lot of people I'm sure um and you
[05:03] kind of have to set aside all of your
[05:05] preconceived notions of what you think
[05:06] is true what you think is right what you
[05:08] think is best and really go into it with
[05:10] an open mind and so you know that can be
[05:12] hard for for many folks to do is it kind
[05:14] of like
[05:16] an AF being afraid of uh the bitcoiners
[05:20] of like they they don't need financial
[05:22] planners because they just DCA and
[05:24] getting more savings and and stuff like
[05:26] that is the the the aspect of like if if
[05:28] they just buy
[05:30] only Bitcoin and they can use Bitcoin as
[05:32] store of value Med of exchange and
[05:33] everything um what they what do they
[05:37] need uh the financial planners
[05:39] for um are you asking me is that what
[05:43] other financial planners think and
[05:44] that's why they avoid avoid Bitcoin or
[05:46] or what's what are you where are you
[05:48] asking it from I I think the I think
[05:50] both perspectives are fun uh the first
[05:52] perspective is like is that what uh
[05:54] financial planners think and the second
[05:56] aspect of like okay what is the role of
[05:59] financial planning within Bitcoin if you
[06:01] just just need to DC about that that
[06:04] later I think that's really fun also
[06:06] discuss with uh but look first like if
[06:08] that's a f of financial planners even um
[06:12] I don't I don't think that most
[06:14] traditional you know financial planners
[06:16] see that they don't see that Bitcoin
[06:18] could you know significantly reduce the
[06:22] need for financial advice reduce the
[06:24] complexity within the financial system
[06:26] reduce the size of government and allow
[06:29] people to just save again and not have
[06:31] to invest I don't think they see that
[06:33] obviously bitcoiners can see that
[06:35] potential future um and I receive a lot
[06:38] of push back being a financial planner
[06:39] for bitcoiners you know especially on
[06:42] you the YouTube comments the YouTube
[06:43] comments love to say like oh this guy he
[06:46] knows he's going to be obsolete he's
[06:48] worthless he's just trying to hang on to
[06:50] to his job he's just trying to get you
[06:51] to pay him for for something that you
[06:53] don't need um you know but from a
[06:55] bitcoiner perspective we are still
[06:58] living in a blended world right now yes
[07:00] we have Bitcoin but it's so early it has
[07:03] not changed the world as we see or as we
[07:08] think it can you know we're not on a
[07:10] Bitcoin standard yet to where that we're
[07:13] living in that reality we're in this
[07:15] Blended world this Blended Fiat money
[07:17] world where we we have this you know
[07:20] sound money in Bitcoin but with then we
[07:22] still have this Fiat denominated system
[07:24] that we're operating within so we still
[07:26] have these complex tax laws we still
[07:28] have the um you know estate planning
[07:31] that we go over with clients we still
[07:33] have to think through a retirement plan
[07:35] and how that looks when when we're you
[07:37] know we may have even 100% Bitcoin we
[07:40] have many clients who are get on zero
[07:42] 100% Bitcoin but again their life is
[07:45] denominated in dollars and so with the
[07:48] volatility of Bitcoin there's still
[07:51] things that we need to navigate that you
[07:54] know Bitcoin just hasn't solved yet it
[07:56] hasn't completely transformed the
[07:58] industry yet um and so there's still a
[08:01] lot of value in working with financial
[08:03] planner to tie the money that we see or
[08:06] the the numbers on a screen that we you
[08:08] know that represent our wealth to the
[08:10] outcomes that we want to see in life um
[08:13] and so you know as much as we want as
[08:15] bitcoiners love to push back on you know
[08:17] that okay you know we don't need
[08:19] financial advisors anymore um I I simply
[08:21] don't think that's true and I think it's
[08:23] a very um
[08:25] shortsighted way to view things that
[08:28] could you know
[08:30] could have you run into some pitfalls um
[08:32] financially yeah also think like I think
[08:36] the the the job of a financial planner
[08:38] will change on a Bitcoin standard but
[08:40] even if we completely get rid of the
[08:42] feeld system um a financial planner will
[08:46] probably still make sense um but it will
[08:49] probably be on a higher level uh and a
[08:53] more sophisticated level that's just my
[08:56] like I'm I'm not a financial Banner like
[08:58] I I have no clue about about industry
[09:00] it's just like my understanding of like
[09:01] how the world probably works on on a
[09:03] Bitcoin standard from the people that I
[09:05] talk to but uh it's it interesting to to
[09:09] go through that Avenue yeah I I um one
[09:12] of my recent podcast interviews actually
[09:14] I was talking with the Bitcoin way
[09:16] Michael over at the Bitcoin way um and
[09:18] he said that you know I appreciated his
[09:21] perspective on financial planning the
[09:23] financial planning industry on a Bitcoin
[09:24] standard you know whenever we do reach a
[09:26] Bitcoin standard you know we refer to
[09:28] bitcoin as the her rate right now we
[09:30] often hear that like if if you if you
[09:32] can't beat the Bitcoin you know
[09:34] compounded annual return then you know
[09:36] you should just buy Bitcoin and not
[09:38] worry about investing in anything else
[09:40] um but eventually when we reach you know
[09:42] a mass adoption hopefully uh with
[09:44] Bitcoin you know that hurdle rate will
[09:46] come down quite a bit and people will
[09:48] still want to invest their money in some
[09:50] capacity you know in in the local
[09:52] business or in something else and so I
[09:54] could see um what he said was he could
[09:57] see financial advisors financial plan
[09:59] ERS um you know kind of being like U an
[10:03] adviser in a kind of PE private Equity
[10:05] way if you will you know they're vetting
[10:07] businesses evaluating the businesses you
[10:10] know Financial strength stuff like that
[10:12] kind of back to you know evaluating
[10:14] individual stocks maybe you know how
[10:15] people used to do uh early on and people
[10:17] still do today but it's you know the
[10:19] index fund kind of world that's taken
[10:21] over that but anyways um you know I
[10:23] could see that being a potential fit you
[10:26] know for a financial advisor financial
[10:28] planner um on a Bitcoin standard you
[10:30] know still investing in companies where
[10:32] you can get outsized returns above and
[10:34] beyond whatever that hurdle rate may be
[10:36] for Bitcoin when we reach that point
[10:38] that's so true and it's um I before
[10:41] Bitcoin I was a stock picker I I really
[10:44] listened to all the the conference calls
[10:47] I read through all those reports 10ks
[10:50] the K
[10:51] qes and it was for me the fun of
[10:55] investing the the fun of figuring out
[10:58] what potential have this company and uh
[11:01] does this return Great Value in the next
[11:05] 5 10 20 years figuring out who who are
[11:07] the great winners of of the future and
[11:10] this was really fun until I found
[11:12] Bitcoin where I'm like okay that's the
[11:14] biggest thing that's happening right now
[11:16] and I want to focus solely on that but I
[11:18] think Bitcoin will come to a maturity
[11:20] level where I start playing with stocks
[11:23] again with like okay maybe like I take
[11:25] 10% off my Bitcoin portfolio and
[11:29] invested in stocks that I think will
[11:32] outperform Bitcoin and probably those
[11:33] stocks at that point have Bitcoin on
[11:35] their balance sheet they are only
[11:37] positive if they have a Bitcoin yield so
[11:40] like having more Bitcoin the the next
[11:42] year as the previous year so I I think
[11:45] that's uh that's super interesting and
[11:48] that will always be there and uh Bitcoin
[11:51] kind of brings the investing back into
[11:53] investing if you know what I mean like
[11:55] the the now it's just like people misuse
[11:59] uh uh the S&P 500 as a savings vehicle
[12:03] like that's S&P if if you use the stock
[12:06] market as a savings vehicle you didn't
[12:09] understand the stock market that's
[12:11] investing uh so uh that's super
[12:15] interesting I think that's what Bitcoin
[12:17] brings back and that's what I also uh
[12:20] meant when I said uh financial planners
[12:23] on a higher level because they have to
[12:24] be really good in picking things that
[12:26] are better than the natural hurdle rate
[12:28] of bit coin which will be really hard
[12:31] but possible and that's what where I
[12:34] think we will be on a on a Bitcoin
[12:36] standard at least yeah no absolutely I I
[12:39] love that you said that it brings the
[12:41] investing back into investing um instead
[12:43] of just savings within the stock market
[12:44] that's a great way to put it and and I I
[12:47] love that uh because yeah I mean right
[12:48] now you know everyone just views putting
[12:51] money in the S&P 500 as you know the
[12:53] no-brainer thing there's really no risk
[12:55] involved in it you know that's where
[12:56] your money should go above you know
[12:57] maybe a small cash position even the the
[13:00] trafi you know financial planner that's
[13:02] what they're pushing people into um you
[13:04] know and and that I I I there's a lot of
[13:09] different directions we could go and
[13:10] talking with that but um you know it's
[13:13] not really investing at the end of the
[13:15] day you know like you're saying so um I
[13:18] appreciate that
[13:20] perspective yeah it's uh now also I I
[13:24] have empathy for your situation
[13:25] currently because you you you basically
[13:27] get hit by both communities like the
[13:29] the the financial planner Community is
[13:31] probably I don't know but they probably
[13:33] viewing you as a lunatic there for even
[13:35] mentioning Bitcoin uh to their clients
[13:37] and then there's like the Bitcoin
[13:38] Community like you know like you're a
[13:40] feared guy like you you're like that
[13:44] financial planner that that is will be
[13:46] obsolete uh and I think both are wrong
[13:50] if they say that but you Pro you're
[13:52] getting hit it's easier for me to be
[13:54] like full on in Bitcoin at least like I
[13:56] have a support group on one side
[13:59] uh to to lean on but I do have a lot of
[14:01] empathy and I actually talked with the
[14:03] last uh financial planner about that
[14:05] topic of like being hit by both
[14:08] Direction it's kind of hard yeah that
[14:10] that's for sure you're absolutely right
[14:13] but you know I always encourage
[14:14] bitcoiners you know even if if you're
[14:16] like listening to this and you're like
[14:18] ah this guy is a Fiat guy you're
[14:20] thinking that you know let's just have a
[14:22] conversation because I think that we'll
[14:24] be able to come to Common Ground on how
[14:26] we view things and you'll be able to see
[14:28] that there is value in talking with with
[14:30] a financial planner I mean not everybody
[14:32] of course you know not everybody can can
[14:34] benefit from you know working with
[14:36] somebody benefit from our services but a
[14:38] lot of people can and once we have a
[14:40] conversation they see the value in it um
[14:42] and and you know we can work together to
[14:45] to help them out um like I said I mean
[14:47] we have clients who are 100% Bitcoin
[14:49] they they live get on zero like they are
[14:52] on a Bitcoin standard and they still
[14:54] value the advice that we can provide
[14:56] because we can go into other things it's
[14:57] not just about investing you know the
[15:00] the typical trafi financial adviser all
[15:03] they do is talk about Investments and
[15:05] and all that really means is putting you
[15:07] into a few index funds taking a you know
[15:09] globally Diversified approach and and
[15:11] they'll kind of brainwash you into
[15:13] thinking that's best even though you're
[15:14] underperforming the S&P 500 and
[15:16] ultimately underperforming monetary
[15:18] inflation so you're actually getting
[15:19] poorer over time even though they'll uh
[15:22] you know use CPI as the hurdle rate and
[15:23] say oh look we're doing a great job and
[15:25] charge you one and a half percent to do
[15:26] it you know most people think that
[15:28] that's what we're doing too that's not
[15:30] that's not the truth we're we're taking
[15:32] a holistic approach we're going over
[15:35] cash flow you know retirement strategy
[15:37] tax planning estate planning Insurance
[15:39] you know and there's a lot of blind
[15:41] spots that bitcoiners have even though
[15:43] they don't think so we even go into the
[15:45] technical stuff with our clients we talk
[15:47] through self- custody we even talk
[15:48] through setting up a node we run a node
[15:50] that our clients can use um so you know
[15:53] there there's a lot of directions that
[15:54] we can go and giving complete wealth
[15:56] management advice that really remove
[15:58] moves all the blind spots and pitfalls
[16:00] of bitcoiners so that your family can
[16:03] continue to benefit from this incredible
[16:05] generational asset that that we now have
[16:08] in Bitcoin I liked also the that in the
[16:10] beginning you mentioned that we are
[16:12] still living in a feat world and I mean
[16:14] we see on a really high level how a
[16:18] Michael sailor or even like an Eric
[16:20] semler and S scientific is using the
[16:23] Fiat games using the Fiat tools to gain
[16:27] uh Power in Bitcoin
[16:29] basically to gain more Bitcoin to
[16:31] accumulate more Bitcoin to have an
[16:33] advantage on the other side when we
[16:35] reach the Bitcoin standard which which
[16:37] is a really clever and smart way to do
[16:40] it um what are some of the ways you uh
[16:44] you can help people now in the feed
[16:47] World already uh to integrate Bitcoin in
[16:50] like in a financial planning uh thing
[16:53] what they usually working on with with
[16:56] clients yeah so like I mentioned before
[16:59] um before we started recording I mean
[17:00] the three biggest things that people
[17:02] reach out to us for are at least right
[17:04] now what we're seeing is people wanting
[17:06] to retire soon and you know maybe they
[17:08] have 20% to 100% Bitcoin and so they're
[17:11] thinking through a retirement plan that
[17:13] is heavily Bitcoin dependent um and
[17:16] there's a lot of pitfalls that we can
[17:17] run into arguably more considerations
[17:20] than people who don't own Bitcoin
[17:21] because of the volatility you know of
[17:23] Bitcoin so there's a common um risk
[17:26] referred to a sequence of ref returns
[17:29] risk sequence of returns risk um that um
[17:32] you know refers to the potential risk
[17:35] that you retire let's say okay right now
[17:38] we have a lot of people that say I want
[17:39] to retire at the top of this bull market
[17:41] 2025 um so they're thinking end of year
[17:44] I'm going to be transitioning into
[17:45] retirement well what typically has
[17:47] happened in the past uh we have these
[17:49] four-year Cycles in Bitcoin we get a 50
[17:52] 80% draw down on the back end of these
[17:54] bull bull market tops okay this sequence
[17:58] of returns risk says that you know if
[18:00] you have very poor returns a sharp draw
[18:03] down or a drawn out bare Market in early
[18:06] retirement so in within the first five
[18:08] years of retirement and you're spending
[18:10] down those assets that puts you the
[18:13] longevity of your overall retirement
[18:15] plan at an incredible risk um if you're
[18:18] starting out retirement with very poor
[18:21] returns um and so that volatility that
[18:23] we're you know that we have seen in
[18:25] Bitcoin whether or not that continues to
[18:26] happen or not you know nobody knows
[18:29] um but you know when you're 100% Bitcoin
[18:31] or proxies micro strategy you know
[18:34] miners whatever it may be you're writing
[18:37] this roller coaster and so if you get
[18:39] those you know initial years wrong
[18:41] there's potential you could be spending
[18:43] down your stack very quickly and now
[18:45] you've put yourself at risk of having to
[18:47] brush up your resume uh and go back to
[18:50] work so that's one common problem that
[18:52] we're working through with a lot of
[18:53] people right now to put a Implement a
[18:55] strategy that can protect against these
[18:57] downside risks so that they can
[18:59] ultimately focus on what's most
[19:01] important to them you know you can spend
[19:03] more time with your kids more time with
[19:04] your grandkids take that trip you always
[19:06] wanted with your wife you know whatever
[19:07] it is buy that retirement home um
[19:10] whatever goals that you have or we have
[19:11] a lot of folks that want to be
[19:12] charitable you know they want to donate
[19:14] to their church or set up a nonprofit
[19:16] whatever it may be so thinking through
[19:17] all these goals um and the risks you
[19:20] know that come with the volatility of
[19:21] Bitcoin is a big thing um and then we're
[19:23] also going over tax strategy and Estate
[19:25] Planning and Bitcoin inheritance are the
[19:27] two other big areas that people are
[19:29] reaching out to us for um that we're
[19:31] helping helping them with so we could
[19:33] dive into those uh for sure um but yeah
[19:37] you know you you brought up and asking
[19:39] this question sailor and these other
[19:42] companies leveraging the Fiat system to
[19:44] accumulate more Bitcoin that's you know
[19:47] essentially what we're helping people do
[19:49] on a personal level or in their business
[19:52] we have a lot of business owners who who
[19:54] want to put Bitcoin on their balance
[19:56] sheet or do have Bitcoin on their
[19:57] balance sheet in some form of fact fion
[19:59] but that's the point of all these
[20:00] strategies okay should we utilize Roth
[20:03] accounts you know how can we avoid taxes
[20:06] to ultimately preserve our stack or grow
[20:08] you know grow it over time like there's
[20:10] a lot of strategies Fiat you know
[20:12] related strategies that we can still
[20:14] leverage with the end goal of preserving
[20:18] our stack or you know growing it so you
[20:21] know if you want to completely opt out
[20:24] and just hold Bitcoin and cold storage
[20:26] or you know just save in Bitcoin great
[20:29] you know okay Bitcoin offers you the
[20:31] ability to do that and that's your
[20:32] choice but that's not everyone not
[20:34] everyone wants to do that for one and
[20:37] there's a large amount of people that
[20:38] have been navigating this Fiat world you
[20:41] know contributing to 401 gays or these
[20:43] other accounts whatever and they have
[20:45] this complexity in their life that they
[20:47] need to Now navigate with Bitcoin as a
[20:51] piece of that pie or now that they see
[20:53] Bitcoin it's like how do I unravel this
[20:55] in the best way um and so we're helping
[20:58] them do that that so ultimately that you
[21:00] know less of their money goes to the
[21:01] government and it goes to their kids
[21:03] grandkids and into the life that they
[21:05] want to achieve that's that's great yeah
[21:07] like that's absolutely um some something
[21:11] that that you have to look like I think
[21:14] people maybe bitcoiners even uh really
[21:18] uh falling for that more because they
[21:21] feeling so secure with Bitcoin they're
[21:22] like okay now I don't have to care about
[21:25] Finance finances anymore because I'm
[21:26] just like all in Bitcoin
[21:29] um and then they're like okay now my
[21:32] Bitcoin is valued at that then they put
[21:33] a growth model on that I like oh I can
[21:36] retire now because this is the path
[21:39] forwards and they don't put plans and
[21:42] safety guard rails in place of like okay
[21:44] but what if that plan still happens in
[21:46] the long run for Bitcoin but there's
[21:48] like a threeyear Down Road where you
[21:52] didn't plan for and because you left
[21:54] your job you spent all your Bitcoin and
[21:57] uh then you have zero Bitcoin you have
[21:58] no job and all of the sudden Bitcoin
[22:00] takes off to 10 million that can happen
[22:03] like Bitcoin can be successful and you
[22:05] can still not be successful in in that
[22:07] situation which is I think a real threat
[22:09] for bitcoiners uh so how how do you look
[22:12] at the I think you probably got that
[22:14] question already a lot of like okay how
[22:16] many Bitcoins do we need to retire uh
[22:18] it's it's the the the famous question
[22:20] within the Bitcoin and retirement crowd
[22:23] um but how do you look at that question
[22:25] of how many Bitcoin you need to retire
[22:28] where do you uh feel safe what growth
[22:32] models even uh are are you taking
[22:34] because if you look at retirement in
[22:36] Bitcoin you kind of have to speculate at
[22:40] least a little bit on the growth
[22:42] projections on on bitcoin uh or you just
[22:45] assume of like okay it will be flat at
[22:47] that level for long like how how do you
[22:50] look at that topic yeah that's an
[22:52] excellent question um you know I'll just
[22:56] start by saying if Bitcoin works out to
[22:58] the upside of what we all think can
[23:00] happen we're probably good you know the
[23:03] people that are reaching out to us for a
[23:05] retirement plan you know I would say the
[23:07] average stack size of our client base is
[23:09] probably 10 to 20 Bitcoin I haven't I
[23:12] haven't actually run the numbers but um
[23:15] that just off the top of my head I I
[23:17] have a feeling that's where it would be
[23:19] and so it's like okay if Bitcoin goes to
[23:21] $10 million within the next 10 years
[23:24] whatever you know to the upside like
[23:25] we're they're going to be fine you know
[23:28] and un you're just spending insane an
[23:30] insane amount which most of the time
[23:32] that's not the case bitcoiners have this
[23:34] you know loow low time preference and
[23:37] they've been you know uh financially
[23:38] responsible saving in Bitcoin for you
[23:40] know a long amount of time and they're
[23:42] not about to just become irresponsible
[23:44] just because they're you know a free in
[23:47] a free retirement period um so you know
[23:49] to the upside yeah it's fun to have
[23:51] those conversations think about what's
[23:53] possible and that's definitely you know
[23:55] conversations that we have with folks
[23:57] but we are you know talking about more
[24:00] we're talking about the scenarios like
[24:01] you just mentioned where okay I retire
[24:04] now Bitcoin doesn't perform like I
[24:07] expect what does that mean for my
[24:09] situation what does that mean for my
[24:11] life not just the numbers on the screen
[24:13] but am I going to have to go back to
[24:15] work am I not going to be able to take
[24:17] that you know trip with my wife or is am
[24:19] I not going to be able to sleep well at
[24:21] night you know whatever it is whatever
[24:23] that you know dream or goal that you
[24:25] have that you think is possible right
[24:27] now um
[24:29] what if that doesn't play out like you
[24:31] expect those are the scenarios that
[24:33] we're talking through a lot more with
[24:34] folks because we need to accept that
[24:38] these possibilities are possible it's
[24:40] easy to watch you know Bitcoin podcasts
[24:43] and you know hear the price predictions
[24:45] of 500,000 million dollars whatever it
[24:48] may be those are those are fun those are
[24:50] exciting you know it's you you H you you
[24:52] get to the end of the the YouTube
[24:54] episode and and uh you feel really good
[24:57] about the decision you've made to have
[24:59] the amount of Bitcoin that you have but
[25:01] we need to be talking about the what if
[25:03] scenarios to the downside especially
[25:06] when it's tremendously impactful on the
[25:09] life that you're you could be living you
[25:11] know when we're thinking about growth
[25:13] rates stuff like that like you know I
[25:16] mean we can yeah you can put a 20% you
[25:18] know cager on on bitcoin and it looks
[25:20] great in a retirement calculator but
[25:23] again you know the retirement
[25:25] calculators they're assuming Bitcoin
[25:27] just goes up 20% every single year you
[25:29] know like you were saying Bitcoin could
[25:30] still work out but you you your
[25:32] situation didn't work out um because
[25:35] that's not the reality of what actually
[25:38] will happen you know even if we are
[25:40] right on the compounded annual growth
[25:43] rate over the next decade it may look
[25:45] like 80% draw down you know uh a bare
[25:49] market for three years and then a 400%
[25:52] return on the back end you know whatever
[25:54] and and that comes out to a 20% cager
[25:57] you know I don't know those are just
[25:57] random numbers off the top of my head
[26:00] but yeah the point is is like yes we
[26:04] have these conversations but it's it's
[26:06] all hypothetical we don't know what the
[26:09] future holds and so we need to just play
[26:12] out all these scenarios and then choose
[26:14] what we are willing to accept for our
[26:17] future the the risks that we're willing
[26:19] to accept to the downside and protect
[26:22] against those you know and so if we come
[26:24] up with a plan that says okay we're
[26:26] protecting against this down side
[26:28] scenario and then it works out to the
[26:30] upside amazing you know we're we're all
[26:34] uh in a good place anyways so I won't
[26:37] even try to put a number to what we
[26:39] expect you know as far as the the growth
[26:41] rate of Bitcoin um in these retirement
[26:46] projections are you looking at uh I mean
[26:50] it's it's the same question I guess but
[26:53] uh when you when you think about there
[26:56] are now a lot of people that put on the
[26:58] thumbnail okay 0.1 Bitcoin to retire I'm
[27:01] one of those
[27:03] people uh because like uh you you you
[27:06] make that growth projections and guest
[27:08] came on the show and say like okay this
[27:10] is what I expect and and then 0.1
[27:13] Bitcoin or one Bitcoin or 0.21 Bitcoin
[27:17] is then enough to retire so I like the
[27:19] approach that you're taking of like um
[27:22] the upside is great if we take it um but
[27:26] let's protect against the downside let's
[27:28] protected against the the worst case um
[27:31] uh situation because we we do have
[27:35] those uh Bitcoin compounding doc or
[27:38] something like that like there are some
[27:39] calculators where you can take different
[27:42] uh uh models and then you can just
[27:44] project it out and then you're like
[27:46] you're entering like one Bitcoin and all
[27:48] of the sudden yeah like you will have so
[27:51] much after 20 years and you're like oh I
[27:53] can retire now but this calculator is
[27:57] like it's assuming a normal growth rate
[28:00] where maybe Bitcoin doesn't follow that
[28:02] yeah maybe end of the year we at a
[28:04] million and then all of those things are
[28:06] not doesn't matter and you actually uh
[28:08] could retire with like two three Bitcoin
[28:10] and and you don't need like 20 or 15 um
[28:14] so it's an interesting discussion of
[28:16] like how many Bitcoin to retire because
[28:19] we we don't know how much you spend and
[28:21] we don't know what the Bitcoin will look
[28:23] like in in in one two years it's also an
[28:26] interesting discussion of like how do
[28:27] you want to retire because I I don't
[28:29] want to sit on my ass all day long yeah
[28:32] and that's the common common uh you know
[28:34] goal for bitcoiners that we work with is
[28:36] yeah they don't stop working they just
[28:38] work on something else that they really
[28:39] enjoy along with spending more time with
[28:42] their family of course you maybe serving
[28:43] in their church or whatever um but yeah
[28:45] it's funny that you mentioned Bitcoin
[28:47] retirement calculators because my my
[28:49] business partner and I actually just
[28:50] recorded our own podcast yesterday
[28:52] reviewing Unchained and that Bitcoin
[28:54] compounding dcom Bitcoin fire I think
[28:56] calculator um and talking about you know
[28:58] where those are helpful when thinking
[29:00] about retirement but then also
[29:02] discussing the downsides and and where
[29:03] they fall short uh with navigating
[29:06] retirement you know at the end of the
[29:07] day because of the the range of outcomes
[29:10] that we could experience on a Bitcoin
[29:12] you know dependent retirement plan
[29:13] that's where ongoing advice can be so
[29:16] helpful you know when I'm thinking
[29:18] through a retirement plan the analogy
[29:20] that I love to use is a rocket ship to
[29:23] the Moon you know we've all heard the
[29:24] the saying where you know when a rocket
[29:26] ship is heading to the moon it's off
[29:28] course 99.9% of the time but it still
[29:30] reaches its its destination so you know
[29:34] what does that tell you it's constantly
[29:35] course correcting like it it is
[29:38] constantly course correcting back to you
[29:40] know be on track to the destination so
[29:42] it may be off track for most of the time
[29:45] but it's still getting from point A to
[29:47] point B and so that's where an ongoing
[29:49] relationship with someone who is
[29:51] tracking this stuff monitoring this
[29:52] stuff proactively giving you advice as
[29:55] all of these variables change can be so
[29:57] helpful
[29:58] because you know right now I could tell
[30:01] somebody you know here's here's a good
[30:03] retirement plan and then at the end of
[30:05] the year it could be completely
[30:08] different um you know because we do get
[30:11] the bull market that we all think is
[30:12] coming and it's maybe bigger than
[30:14] expected and then all of a sudden it's
[30:16] like well now we have to worry about
[30:17] estate taxes you know for example if
[30:19] you're if you are you know high in N
[30:22] worth all of the sudden at least in the
[30:23] US um estate taxes can be up as much as
[30:27] 40% federally and so you want 40% of
[30:30] your stack to go go buyby if something
[30:32] happens to you no you don't so you know
[30:35] there's a considerations to the upside
[30:36] as well though where we can be valuable
[30:38] to folks so uh I see you got the the
[30:40] retirement calculator pulled up here
[30:42] though I partnered up with coin
[30:45] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:48] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:50] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:53] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[30:56] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:59] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[31:02] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[31:05] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[31:08] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[31:11] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:14] watch collections you have the date of
[31:17] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:20] there and of course also the block
[31:22] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:26] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:28] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:31] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:33] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:36] love those watches so so much if you
[31:40] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:42] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:43] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[31:46] most important step is to keep the
[31:49] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[31:51] wallet my personal recommendation for
[31:53] hard wallet is the bit box it's super
[31:56] secure it's simple to sell set up it's
[31:58] also perfect gift for a friend who has
[32:00] still the Bitcoin on an exchange and you

[32:32] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[32:35] move in case something goes really

[32:44] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[32:48] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[32:51] out how you can level up your
[32:53] sovereignty oh yeah I just want to do
[32:55] because we not talked about it just for
[32:58] people to to see what it it means and
[33:00] that that what we meant with like there
[33:02] are different models in there and they
[33:04] assume a growth R each year uh which
[33:08] would be amazing if we have an asset
[33:09] that just like hits those models because
[33:12] then uh retirement planning would be
[33:13] super easy right give like okay like
[33:16] let's let's say like 0 point uh 21
[33:19] because I think that's an it's a popular
[33:22] number and it's also a very low number
[33:25] uh and and then you hit like the the
[33:27] model with like four and you're like
[33:28] okay let's let's retire in like 20 30 in
[33:31] five years uh and what can we do fix
[33:34] withdrawal let's just put like you need
[33:37] like a uh let's say 50 on to three 50k
[33:42] per year and even if you pay like I
[33:44] don't know 10% taxes on that um then you
[33:47] I I just put in random numbers now to to
[33:49] see what's going off on here M and then
[33:52] you like see it's not working out
[33:57] let's put in uh a whole Bitcoin let
[34:01] let's see what's happening when when we
[34:03] change that to whole
[34:05] Bitcoin um to just to make my point yeah
[34:08] exactly then then you see like okay um
[34:12] uh you still have in like 20 uh 54 like
[34:16] 0.12 Bitcoin and you have more money in
[34:19] fear terms than ever before uh and and
[34:22] you're retired like you you you will
[34:24] every year you will have more money uh
[34:26] than the year before even though uh you
[34:29] don't need more Bitcoin and I think
[34:31] those calculators are too easy like they
[34:35] they're not giving you a full picture of
[34:37] of what's actually reality be helpful in
[34:40] like seeing where the overall trend is
[34:43] going but I wouldn't base the decision
[34:46] of my family for retirement on on those
[34:49] calculators yeah no I I I I appreciate
[34:52] that perspective absolutely because yeah
[34:55] the where where we see it is these can
[34:57] be really helpful for understanding if
[34:59] you're in the ballpark so if someone is
[35:01] thinking about retirement maybe in the
[35:03] near term you know within the next five
[35:05] years let's say this can give you an
[35:08] idea for if you're even close you know
[35:10] it's like okay well if Bitcoin did do
[35:12] this then I'm at least in the ballpark
[35:16] and so I think this is possible or the
[35:19] other scenario where I see these are
[35:21] helpful um is long-term kind of how much
[35:25] do I need to be saving in Bitcoin over
[35:27] time to achieve the goals that I want to
[35:30] achieve like a long-term Financial
[35:32] Independence Target because okay if
[35:34] you're 15 20 years away from even
[35:37] thinking about retirement if you're a
[35:39] young person in your 20s or 30s well
[35:42] there's a lot that's going to change
[35:43] over that amount of time anyways so a
[35:45] long-term projection is only really
[35:47] helpful to just give you an idea for
[35:50] maybe a road map for okay if I'm able to
[35:54] save you know x amount in in Bitcoin for
[35:57] the next next 10 20 years here's an idea
[35:59] of what it could look like so then it
[36:02] allows you to bring to give yourself at
[36:04] least a Target in the near- term to
[36:05] shoot for as far as how much to save to
[36:08] achieve you know a a 20y year you know
[36:11] off Financial Independence Target so th
[36:14] those are the two scenarios where I see
[36:16] these Bitcoin retirement calculators as
[36:18] helpful because you know it get it does
[36:21] give you something it gives you a mental
[36:23] model it gives something tangible to
[36:25] look at and say like am I even close
[36:28] or you know what would I need to be
[36:30] doing now to reach this kind of 20year
[36:33] you know far off goal that uh you know
[36:36] I'm not going to be able to be exact on
[36:38] anyways um so yeah so you know I
[36:41] appreciate that these calculators are
[36:43] out there um and I think you know that
[36:45] one at least um you know I appreciate
[36:48] that there's the ability to do variable
[36:51] withdrawal rates um on there um there is
[36:54] some form of you know accounting for
[36:57] taxes there's a lot of them out there
[36:58] that don't account for taxes um
[37:01] obviously you know if you're if you have
[37:04] all Cold Storage Bitcoin then you know
[37:06] you're just worried about capital gains
[37:07] taxes but if you also have you know an
[37:10] old 401k an IRA a Roth HSA you know at
[37:13] least in the US I know you're not in the
[37:15] US but in the US there's all these types
[37:18] of qualified accounts and so when we're
[37:20] talking with folks there's a lot of
[37:23] opportunity in thinking through how much
[37:26] do I pull and win from each of these
[37:29] different types of accounts and places
[37:31] or you know also factoring in maybe I
[37:34] maybe I access my home equity you know
[37:37] if bitcoin's in a bare Market I would
[37:39] rather use this pool of liquidity over
[37:41] here my home equity or maybe leverage my
[37:43] Bitcoin or something else so there's a
[37:45] lot of different paths you can go um and
[37:48] variables to consider that these just
[37:50] can't account for with specific
[37:53] situations specific strategies but at a
[37:55] high level I think they at least give us
[37:57] something to go off of um you know a
[38:00] mental model to to think through if
[38:02] we're even in the ballpark of where we
[38:03] want to
[38:05] be yeah the tax tax is a a fun there
[38:09] there was in in Austria was the a rule
[38:13] uh till 20 like I'm I'm in Austria so
[38:15] like I live in Austria uh until February
[38:20] 2022 at 2021 if you held your Bitcoin
[38:24] longer for than for a year it was
[38:26] completely taxfree to sell them which
[38:28] was an amazing rule in there for Germany
[38:31] and actually Czech Republic introduced
[38:34] that uh rule uh not that long ago for
[38:36] three years not one year um uh and so
[38:40] like a part of my Bitcoin stack still is
[38:43] actually um uh taxfree because I bought
[38:46] them before 1091 um uh unfor fortunately
[38:51] I never had to sell them uh but yeah
[38:53] like it's it's it's it's fun to think
[38:55] about taxes and I hope I hope never
[38:57] really have to pay taxes on bitcoin so
[38:59] far I didn't have to and I have some
[39:02] some buffer of Bitcoin I can sell
[39:04] without having to pay taxes uh but it's
[39:07] not not everyone is in
[39:08] that I think there Mo most people would
[39:11] have to pay capital gains tax on the
[39:13] Bitcoin if they sell them uh and that's
[39:17] really interesting also I never thought
[39:19] about those calculators as a
[39:21] motivational tool just when you was
[39:23] describing of like giving you an idea
[39:25] how close you are or how much you have
[39:27] to save to get there um it it can be
[39:31] quite um motivational of like you can
[39:34] enter your stack how much you have and
[39:37] if it's in the ballp realistic and then
[39:39] you're like okay what do I have to get
[39:43] towards that it even becomes a
[39:46] discussion um so like it's like okay now
[39:49] I have a stack where it is realistic and
[39:52] now I can thinking about like how
[39:53] exactly do I do that and how to secure
[39:55] against down and stuff like that but it
[39:58] gives you that idea of like okay how
[39:59] much do I have to accumulate how much do
[40:01] I have to work how much do I have to
[40:02] save in order to get there and what do I
[40:04] have to do uh to make that happen which
[40:07] which is really interesting I never
[40:08] thought about those compound growth
[40:11] tools more as a motivation less as a
[40:14] financial twice yeah absolutely yeah I
[40:18] mean it helps to make more make it more
[40:20] tangible like you know if you're in your
[40:21] 20s you're not thinking about retirement
[40:23] but you you know if you're thinking long
[40:24] term you should be setting aside some
[40:26] something
[40:27] uh saving something and so it can just
[40:29] give you a tangible Target to shoot for
[40:32] um you know for your situation
[40:34] absolutely so yeah I think also that's
[40:36] why those videos where you put on like
[40:40] gets to one Bitcoin are so popular
[40:43] because people actually like okay like I
[40:46] have now 0.7 Bitcoin he says like get
[40:48] the one Bitcoin because then this
[40:50] happens uh and it it's kind of
[40:52] motivational of like well now let's like
[40:54] get there I think there's some some sort
[40:56] of value there uh even though like it's
[40:59] it's it's uh mostly without proper
[41:04] disclaimers of like okay just because
[41:06] you are now at one Bitcoin doesn't mean
[41:07] you're uh completely retired probably if
[41:10] you have now one Bitcoin and you
[41:12] completely sto working now and you live
[41:14] in an uh uh in America or so you
[41:17] probably are not
[41:20] retired right now maybe in five years
[41:22] maybe in 10 years depends on how Bitcoin
[41:24] grows but like one Bitcoin right now
[41:27] probably not working out um one thing
[41:29] that's really interesting it's a it's a
[41:32] problem that I ran into this year or
[41:35] last year and and maybe a problem that
[41:37] Bitcoin is in general run will run into
[41:40] more and more H I went all in Bitcoin in
[41:43] 2021 and now since since around one year
[41:48] I also get income in Bitcoin and the
[41:49] income in Bitcoin is actually growing so
[41:51] like the portion of the income I get
[41:54] this more and more into Bitcoin I still
[41:56] manage to the state never have to sell
[41:58] Bitcoin but it gets harder and harder
[42:00] with each month that goes on um because
[42:03] my feed income uh is stable and the the
[42:06] Bitcoin income is kind of growing uh so
[42:09] I get to the point where I have to
[42:11] decide okay do I either uh sell some of
[42:15] my Bitcoin or do I use the um I should
[42:20] have forgot the name um the uh when you
[42:25] take depth loan against the Bitcoin
[42:27] borrowing against the Bitcoin uh there's
[42:29] like Firefish that Unchained also I
[42:32] think provides service like that there
[42:33] are many providers for for that how do
[42:36] you how do you look at that from a
[42:38] financial planning perspective of like
[42:40] do a sell Bitcoin or do a take a loan
[42:44] against my Bitcoin to to pay my feeld
[42:46] bills especially for for bitcoiners who
[42:49] are already kind of Allin uh and they
[42:53] are getting in the situation where they
[42:54] just get some fear have to add a sell or
[42:58] borrow against them uh how how do you
[43:01] look at that
[43:02] decision yeah so first um I think it's
[43:06] important to just mention that this is
[43:08] not an All or Nothing decision I I
[43:11] commonly talk with people um you know
[43:13] they're reaching out and you know maybe
[43:15] they're they're nearing this retirement
[43:17] and so they're thinking you know I'd
[43:18] rather just never sell you know borrow
[43:20] against the Bitcoin and live off of it
[43:22] you know for the rest of my life um and
[43:25] it's always it's they're always always
[43:27] thinking about it of I either have to
[43:29] only sell or only leverage um so I just
[43:32] always like to hit hit home on that is
[43:34] like it can be a combination of both of
[43:37] these strategies you could sell when the
[43:40] opportunity is or when the time is right
[43:42] you can also leverage when maybe Bitcoin
[43:45] is complet is down you know in a bare
[43:47] Market if we continue to see the cycles
[43:49] that we've seen so it doesn't have to be
[43:51] all or nothing it's important to mention
[43:54] um but also on the flip side you know
[43:56] when we're thinking through this it's
[43:58] different for everyone you know I mean
[44:00] yes there are the the bitcoiners that
[44:02] are like ah yeah I never sell you know
[44:04] I'm willing to take that risk of of
[44:05] leveraging the Bitcoin and and uh you
[44:08] know taking on that that debt then
[44:11] there's the other people where it's like
[44:12] you know I would rather just sell a
[44:14] little bit of my stack live off of it
[44:16] and not have to worry about having you
[44:19] know my uh not worry about having part
[44:22] of my Bitcoin stack at risk you know so
[44:25] individual preferences will come into
[44:27] this conversation significantly when
[44:30] we're thinking through this um but at a
[44:33] at a high level you know there's not too
[44:37] many providers out there that offer
[44:40] these types of loans um so you know you
[44:43] mentioned Unchained there are some other
[44:46] institutions but you know the the
[44:48] industry the infrastructure you know at
[44:50] large is still very early interest rates
[44:53] are very high right now for Bitcoin back
[44:56] loans origination fees are High um and
[44:59] it's not offered to to everybody at
[45:01] least not in the United States Unchained
[45:03] I believe is only a bit businesses at
[45:06] this point not individuals um there are
[45:09] some others that I I've talked with and
[45:11] even our clients have used um for some
[45:14] Bitcoin backed loans but I'm excited to
[45:15] see what happens as this this um
[45:18] infrastructure in Industry continues to
[45:20] grow because it will make it a lot
[45:22] easier for people to utilize these
[45:25] strategies you know within their within
[45:27] their life um so yeah I don't know if
[45:30] that necessarily answered your question
[45:32] too specifically it's it's very hard to
[45:35] get into but um you know one thing I
[45:38] will just say is if you are going to go
[45:40] borrow against your Bitcoin one you need
[45:43] to vet how the the person is go or the
[45:45] person the institution is going to be
[45:47] custody the Bitcoin are they going to be
[45:49] reh hypothecating how are they going to
[45:51] be holding it how are they going to be
[45:52] securing it you need to be thinking
[45:54] about that for sure um because we've
[45:56] seen all of these other places blow up
[45:58] and then you need to be thinking about
[46:00] your loan to value ratio so if you're
[46:03] going to be you know putting up one
[46:04] Bitcoin as collateral I would not be
[46:07] loaning you know any more than 25% of
[46:10] the value uh of that Bitcoin because you
[46:13] do not want to get liquidated and you do
[46:15] not want to be in position where you're
[46:16] forced to put up more Bitcoin that you
[46:18] may not have so I would never leverage
[46:21] your entire stack and even then I
[46:23] wouldn't go over maybe 20% you know 25%
[46:26] % I'll say uh loan to value ratio
[46:29] because that allows for the last time I
[46:31] ran the numbers that would allow for
[46:33] like a 58% draw down if I'm right um if
[46:36] you had a 60% limit on your loan to
[46:39] value so let's just say let's just put
[46:41] numbers to it because I know I'm put
[46:43] throwing out a lot of percentages here
[46:45] let's say you know Bitcoin 100,000 you
[46:47] put up one Bitcoin as a collateral you
[46:50] know when I'm saying 25% loan to value
[46:52] that's 25,000 that you're borrowing
[46:54] against the Bitcoin um if most places
[46:57] that I've seen the highest that they'll
[46:59] let that go is 60% so that's your cap
[47:02] that most that you could borrow is
[47:04] 60,000 um so that's kind of your range
[47:07] that you want to watch out for for
[47:08] liquidation or putting up more more
[47:10] Capital um
[47:12] so yeah to boil that down one be careful
[47:16] with it two make sure you understand how
[47:19] they're custody in the assets and then
[47:21] three um you know I would not put up I
[47:24] would not take the maximum amount of
[47:25] loan to value um you know against your
[47:28] Bitcoin so hopefully that gets more
[47:31] tangible with my answer than than what I
[47:33] had before yeah I think it's it's it's
[47:35] great for me um when I look at that
[47:38] question like I'm leaning very much
[47:41] right now with just like selling Bitcoin
[47:43] I feel like uh if I get to the point of
[47:45] like uh having to to sell Bitcoin
[47:48] because I also earning Bitcoin so that's
[47:49] not Fe sufficient enough to to cover
[47:52] everything I'm just selling Bitcoin um
[47:55] even if I had to pay C gain sexs it's
[47:58] the more opted out way of feared and
[48:02] it's the more uh um very free way of
[48:06] think thinking for me and and um having
[48:10] not to worry is something I really do
[48:13] like uh to have in my life and so but if
[48:18] if I I think about borrowing I don't
[48:20] like any offer that is currently out
[48:21] there like I tried everything like I
[48:25] signed up and saw everything the the
[48:27] terms and everything and because I was
[48:30] like okay I as a podcast host you kind
[48:32] of have also a little bit of an um um
[48:36] obligation to at least inform yourself
[48:38] of like what is the the office out there
[48:41] the interest rates are always too high
[48:42] for me um uh most of them don't offer
[48:46] nice self- custody it has to be self-
[48:48] custody if if I don't have at least one
[48:50] key uh I I don't do it like I have to
[48:53] have at least one out of three keys uh
[48:56] to to even do that uh remotely and there
[48:59] has to be two other parties to have
[49:01] other like there then escrow and and all
[49:04] those those weird things yeah loan to
[49:06] value I'm I'm even I'm very conservative
[49:09] I would go with like 10% like uh I I
[49:11] would just go very low with with that
[49:13] but like if they give me more I'll I'll
[49:15] just do the other thing on on my back
[49:18] end uh and and the main thing that is
[49:21] bothering me now with platforms that do
[49:24] peer top and stuff like that the usually
[49:26] offer just one year I would never do
[49:29] anything under five
[49:31] years exactly because one year you are
[49:34] very unsafe with like uh volatility I
[49:37] don't know where Bitcoin is in one year
[49:39] but I'm pretty sure uh that Bitcoin is
[49:42] higher in five years than now like I'm
[49:45] I'm putting there pretty high percentage
[49:47] on on that even though there's no 100%
[49:50] but uh I'm pretty sure in five years I
[49:52] will be quite safe there uh so uh uh I'm
[49:58] just leaning very much again of like
[50:00] just selling some Bitcoin for the peace
[50:03] of mind but I do think there will be
[50:05] coming a lot of interesting offers for
[50:07] for for Bitcoin is in the in the in the
[50:10] future where I'm like okay maybe it's
[50:12] like uh six years terms and it's like
[50:15] 2.9% and it's like 25 Lo to value and
[50:20] and uh you have your own key like it's a
[50:22] three out of two out of three multi and
[50:25] then it's like ah that that's tempting
[50:28] yeah yeah definitely and yeah as the
[50:31] industry continue to grow as I expect
[50:32] the terms will continue to get better
[50:34] but yeah that's a good point the
[50:35] peer-to-peer platforms still yeah it's
[50:38] it's very short-term loans High interest
[50:40] rates and yeah it's just not uh not
[50:45] quite there for you know adoption to be
[50:47] significant so I'm completely with you
[50:50] absolutely um the next question is kind
[50:52] of hard for me to ask but uh I think
[50:56] it's really important and most of my
[50:58] audience is in in America so maybe for
[51:00] them it's it's uh it's it's more what
[51:03] are the possible Tax Strategies and the
[51:05] things that you already hinted towards
[51:08] uh uh what are you're also doing with
[51:10] your clients in terms of Bitcoin uh I
[51:14] know uh this this podcast is available
[51:16] all across the globe so Tax Strategies
[51:18] are different depending on where you are
[51:20] so like someone in the US has it totally
[51:23] different in in Austria but I think
[51:25] around 50% of the audience is in America
[51:27] so like uh and and maybe some of the
[51:30] concepts are um also applicable uh
[51:34] worldwide uh what are you doing there
[51:37] because on the surface it looks easy
[51:38] like oh you buy it you sell it you have
[51:40] to pay capital gains tax on it yeah
[51:43] absolutely good question um so yeah
[51:45] there's a lot of different directions
[51:46] that we could go with Tax Strategies um
[51:48] obviously if you if you're a business
[51:49] owner that's going to open up a ton of
[51:52] new a ton of avenues that aren't
[51:53] available to people who aren't business
[51:55] owners um so and I've put a a Blog on
[51:57] our website actually of the top 10 Tax
[52:00] Strategies for Bitcoin business owners
[52:02] so U if you wanted to go check that out
[52:04] you can um you know I'll speak more
[52:07] towards the Bitcoin kind of specific
[52:08] things um you know like you're
[52:11] mentioning so it could apply to more
[52:13] folks um yeah I mean so there's you know
[52:17] within the US there's first you can
[52:20] utilize different types of accounts
[52:22] different types of tax structures to
[52:24] hold your Bitcoin within so a lot of
[52:26] people right now um you know they may
[52:28] have a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA
[52:31] that they're holding Bitcoin within or
[52:33] maybe in their 401K through their job um
[52:36] you know they're trying to get exposure
[52:38] to bitcoin you know a lot of people um
[52:40] you know one tip that I'll give folks
[52:43] they think that if there is money in
[52:45] their 401k plan that it's kind of locked
[52:47] up um and they're limited to the
[52:49] available options that their company
[52:52] provides as far as investment options go
[52:55] typically their mutual funds or just
[52:56] index ETFs that aren't very good uh
[52:59] Investments aren't very good options um
[53:02] but thinking it's locked up is usually
[53:05] just due to ignorance of what strategies
[53:07] are available to them um so if you have
[53:10] 401k plan and you know you can't get
[53:13] exposure to bitcoin within it there's
[53:16] one big strategy that you should be
[53:17] aware of is the ability to either
[53:20] self-direct that 401k or do an inservice
[53:25] rollover into an IRA account so an
[53:29] inservice rollover it could be inservice
[53:31] withdrawal is what it could be referred
[53:33] to as also also so you want to look at
[53:37] your summary plan document is usually
[53:39] what it's called through your employer
[53:41] and they may offer you the you the
[53:42] ability to self-direct your 401k meaning
[53:45] that you actually get to choose the
[53:47] Investments you're not limited to what
[53:48] they only offer you so switching that
[53:51] over to self-directed gives you then the
[53:53] full gamut if you will of investment
[53:56] option options where you may not be able
[53:57] to hold spot Bitcoin but you could at
[53:59] least hold you know an ETF or a Bitcoin
[54:02] proxy uh within your 401k plan so that's
[54:04] something that not a lot of people know
[54:07] um and I've seen some bitcoiner people
[54:10] on bitcoin Twitter like yeah I just
[54:12] pulled the money out of my 401k and took
[54:14] all the you know took the tax hit took
[54:16] the early withdrawal penalty and that's
[54:18] how I got exposure to bitcoin it's like
[54:19] well you know okay okay but there are
[54:22] other options so that one's important to
[54:24] be aware of um and then the inservice
[54:26] withdrawal or roll over is you know
[54:28] while you're still working for the
[54:29] company they may offer you the ability
[54:31] to roll that money out of the 401K plan
[54:34] into an IRA that could be an IRA with
[54:37] you know Swan or Unchained or these
[54:39] other Ira providers where you could own
[54:42] actual Bitcoin or you could still move
[54:44] it to a custodian you know like Fidelity
[54:47] or Schwab or you know wherever and um
[54:50] you know again get access to the Bitcoin
[54:52] ETFs to get exposure so there's you know
[54:54] qualified accounts you know like I
[54:56] mentioned th those are good for tax
[54:59] strategy 401K Ira Roth IRA hsas within
[55:02] the within the United States um outside
[55:06] of that uh a lot of people right now are
[55:09] thinking through gifting and donation
[55:11] strategies so bitcoiners you know if
[55:14] Bitcoin works out I believe we're going
[55:15] to have an incredible opportunity to
[55:18] make an impact on our local communities
[55:20] and you know impact in the ways that we
[55:22] want to see in the world because of the
[55:24] amount of wealth that we will have um
[55:27] and so thinking through gifting and
[55:28] donation strategies is is always fun
[55:30] because that aligns with my Christian
[55:32] faith and and I believe you know
[55:34] generosity is important and foundational
[55:36] to our life and and managing our money
[55:39] um so there's a few different things to
[55:40] consider when thinking through these
[55:42] strategies you know if it's if it's
[55:44] gifting just to family members in the
[55:47] United States you allowed to gift I
[55:50] believe it's $199,000 for this year per
[55:53] recipient with no tax consequences
[55:56] whatsoever so if you're a married couple
[55:59] let's say me and my wife and we have you
[56:02] know we're older we have kids and
[56:05] grandkids let's say um you know we have
[56:07] three kids we could give per per person
[56:10] so me I could give $19,000 worth of
[56:13] bitcoin to each of our kids so there's
[56:15] 19 time three my wife could give
[56:18] $199,000 worth of bitcoin to each of our
[56:21] kids there's you know 19 * three again
[56:24] and then we can also do that to all all
[56:26] the grandkids as well so this is a a tax
[56:29] efficient way to pass the assets to your
[56:33] family to create that generational
[56:35] wealth that generational impact that you
[56:37] probably do want to see already and do
[56:40] it while you're still alive so you avoid
[56:43] the capital gains taxes or whatever
[56:45] taxes may be applicable on the on that
[56:48] those assets and you're giving it to
[56:50] your kids and grandkids who probably
[56:52] need it more than you do right now um
[56:54] and you prevent that from you know the
[56:57] taxes from going to the government in
[56:58] the future so there's a lot of different
[57:00] gifting strategies but that's most
[57:02] simply uh one that I think people should
[57:04] be aware of um and then also another um
[57:10] donating strategy is is utilizing a
[57:13] Donor advised fund so not many people
[57:16] are familiar with these but it gives you
[57:18] the ability to put money into this fund
[57:21] it doesn't actually go to the charity
[57:23] yet but when you put the money in you
[57:25] get the charitable deduction right then
[57:27] you get the full charitable deduction so
[57:29] let's say you know I put a $100,000 into
[57:32] a donor advice fund of Bitcoin the fund
[57:34] can continue to hold Bitcoin into the
[57:36] future let it appreciate and then I can
[57:38] give it to Charities later or I can give
[57:40] it to Charities over time so I get the
[57:42] deduction now but I allow the assets to
[57:44] continue to grow and you know give it to
[57:47] whomever I may want to um you know o
[57:50] over you know X period of time so um
[57:53] those are two simple you know base level
[57:54] strategies uh to to consider there's you
[57:58] know I know that's a lot of talking that
[57:59] I've done there's a lot more that we
[58:01] could go into um like you know a fun one
[58:04] is uh using Bitcoin Miners and the
[58:08] depreciation on bitcoin miners to offset
[58:10] other income um because of the
[58:12] depreciation rules in the United States
[58:14] so um that that's a fun one that a lot
[58:16] of people don't think about um you know
[58:18] for folks in retirement we also look at
[58:20] Roth conversion strategies uh we can
[58:22] also utilize irrevocable trusts for high
[58:25] net worth folks to avoid estate taxes
[58:27] and and other taxes um yeah so again
[58:31] there's a lot of things we could go into
[58:33] but uh um those I think at least plant
[58:37] seeds for for different strategies yeah
[58:40] I think that's also like what I usually
[58:42] try with the podcast of like uh not not
[58:45] only planting seeds but also giving some
[58:47] some ideas because you you will never
[58:50] get a full strategy on a podcast uh but
[58:53] you might hear like one or two nuggets
[58:56] of like okay like I heard that that
[58:58] sounds very
[59:00] interesting uh let let's look that up um
[59:02] how I can actually do that and then form
[59:04] a strategy around that I think that's
[59:06] kind of like uh the the really good
[59:09] thing and especially like the the
[59:11] gifting I I was on aware of that like uh
[59:13] I also heard about it I think last year
[59:15] something like that in Austria you can
[59:17] actually between family members gift up
[59:19] to
[59:20] 50,000 uh Euros uh which is amazing like
[59:23] you can basically gift your mom half a
[59:25] Bitcoin Co um that that is that's quite
[59:29] some some money and I think between
[59:31] strangers it's within five years I think
[59:36] 15,000 uh so like it's a very low way
[59:39] lower of a of a of a limit but still uh
[59:43] it's possible um for for all the
[59:45] austrians look it up like maybe I'm
[59:47] wrong with the numbers but something
[59:49] like something like that is uh is is
[59:51] possible and and it's probably there's
[59:54] some rule like that in almost every
[59:56] country so it's probably not just
[59:58] Austria in America it's probably like
[60:00] Sweden UK Canada they they have some
[60:03] numbers there on where the limits are
[60:05] and then how much you can gift without
[60:07] it being a taxable event or like for you
[60:10] to or the other person to have to open
[60:12] business for that or something like that
[60:14] uh so uh that that that's something I
[60:16] think those imp impulses like the small
[60:19] like inputs and and and brain nuggets
[60:21] are are really important for people who
[60:24] like oh like I could also do that uh and
[60:26] and then they can uh either either book
[60:29] a service with a consultant or like just
[60:31] go in there and and and research
[60:33] themselves on how to do it I think
[60:35] that's a that's the real value of of
[60:37] those conversations so thank you so much
[60:39] for uh putting those nuggets out there
[60:42] yeah absolutely absolutely yeah I mean
[60:45] the other big thing I know we're we're
[60:46] getting probably near the end here but
[60:48] uh the other big thing that we typically
[60:50] help folks with is Estate Planning and
[60:52] Bitcoin inheritance protocols um so if
[60:55] you want to dive into that you know we
[60:57] could because that is probably the
[60:59] biggest blind spot that we that we see
[61:02] um among bitcoiners is okay you've done
[61:05] the hard work of learning about Bitcoin
[61:07] you've started accumulating it's working
[61:09] out for you but if you were to get hit
[61:11] by a bus tomorrow you know your family
[61:13] doesn't understand Bitcoin you know how
[61:15] we didn't know how to access it kind of
[61:17] thing um and so that's something that I
[61:20] don't think a lot of bitcoiners have
[61:22] taken this time to actually think
[61:24] through um you know they're they're
[61:26] still thinking about these these price
[61:28] targets and stuff like that but if your
[61:30] family can't benefit or access the
[61:32] Bitcoin if something were to happen to
[61:34] you then you know you effectively you
[61:36] failed yeah like the bitcoiners thinking
[61:38] a lot about oh like where Bitcoin might
[61:41] go and they can ex exactly explain to
[61:43] you on what the economics uh of Bitcoin
[61:47] are and then like why Bitcoin will be
[61:49] successful and then you're like oh like
[61:51] how will your family enter your Bitcoin
[61:54] if you are hit by a bus tomorrow
[61:56] yeah I don't know if they thought about
[61:58] and there are some Bitcoins out there
[61:59] that have like oh like I want to take it
[62:01] with me and that's a fair assumption but
[62:04] uh Mo most people want to leave uh the
[62:07] family a little bit and I think as you
[62:09] said I think there's a big blind spot
[62:11] for for bitcoiners and the last years we
[62:14] got so many great tools for that like
[62:16] time locks multi signature there so many
[62:18] great services and so many great
[62:21] technical things we uh we can do about
[62:23] that um uh maybe let's get a little bit
[62:26] in there just to raise the awareness of
[62:28] like what's possible and why you should
[62:30] do it and and and what's maybe some of
[62:32] your experiences in in that field yeah
[62:35] yeah absolutely um so at a high level
[62:38] when we're thinking through an estate a
[62:39] Bitcoin estate plan there's really three
[62:42] primary things that you want to make
[62:43] sure are taken care of first and
[62:46] foremost and this is again again going
[62:48] to be United States specific um this
[62:50] still May apply in other places
[62:52] something to think about and research
[62:54] for sure um but the first thing that you
[62:56] want to take care of is making sure that
[62:58] the legal title of the Bitcoin assets
[63:02] passes to the right people at the right
[63:05] time when if you were to pass away so
[63:08] the legal right to ownership of the
[63:11] asset is something that is heavily
[63:13] overlooked in the Bitcoin space when
[63:15] we're thinking through Bitcoin
[63:17] inheritance a lot of people think
[63:18] through software protocols offered by
[63:20] Unchained and Casa and these other
[63:22] places um but they're not thinking
[63:24] through the legal title side of it um
[63:27] and so by default in the United States
[63:30] if you were to do nothing you were you
[63:33] had no estate plan in place this is
[63:35] where we get bitcoiners that say well
[63:37] why can't I just give them the keys you
[63:39] know they're like well doesn't that
[63:41] solve everything it doesn't solve
[63:43] everything by default in the United
[63:45] States your assets actually go through a
[63:48] process called probate so it's a public
[63:50] court proceeding where a judge decides
[63:54] who gets your assets
[63:56] and that becomes public knowledge at
[63:59] that point so okay I have five Bitcoin
[64:03] 10 Bitcoin you know whatever and now
[64:07] that is public available information
[64:10] that my kids just received x amount of
[64:14] Bitcoin I don't know a bitcoiner that
[64:16] wants that you know that paints a Target
[64:19] on their back um or if we do it
[64:22] completely outside the legal system
[64:25] let's say just hand them the keys um you
[64:28] know under the radar you run into some
[64:31] tax fraud and litigation risks so if it
[64:35] was not properly documented that the
[64:37] legal right to ownership went to your
[64:39] kids or to whomever it may be your
[64:42] brother your niece nephew whatever well
[64:46] now they have potentially just committed
[64:49] tax fraud or they're opened up to to
[64:51] that risk um because it was not legally
[64:54] documented that ownership passed to them
[64:57] um and it was not recorded in the estate
[65:00] of of you your estate so that's what
[65:05] happens by default or if we do it under
[65:07] the radar just giving them the keys it's
[65:09] a major risk that I I have not actually
[65:12] met a bitcoiner and talked with them um
[65:15] where they have wanted to actually do do
[65:18] it that way and go about it that way so
[65:20] how do we solve for that typically in
[65:22] the United States this is where we would
[65:24] leverage a revocable living trust and we
[65:27] would incorporate the Bitcoin into that
[65:28] trust and that would allow things to PR
[65:31] pass in a private and controlled way
[65:33] outside of the probate process and that
[65:35] allows the legal title to pass to the
[65:36] right people at the right time as we
[65:39] would lay out in there so that's the
[65:40] first thing that you want to make sure
[65:42] it's taken care of in a Bitcoin estate
[65:43] plan the second thing is your Bitcoin
[65:46] inheritance protocol so this is truly
[65:49] how do we make sure that the physical
[65:52] possession of the keys goes to the right
[65:54] people at the right time
[65:56] now I want to be very clear that you
[65:59] don't need time locks you don't need
[66:03] collaborative custody you don't need
[66:05] another party to be involved to take
[66:07] care of this you're simply answering the
[66:09] question how do I get the keys from me
[66:12] to whomever I want to receive them at
[66:15] the time that I may pass away or become
[66:17] incapacitated you know can't make
[66:19] decisions for myself so at a high level
[66:22] that's the question you're trying to
[66:23] solve it doesn't have to be done with a
[66:25] software you know implementation of okay
[66:27] the P that you know my air reaches out
[66:30] and now they get access to the backup
[66:32] keys or or whatever it is um that these
[66:34] software protocols offer um it's it can
[66:37] be done in any way you know as long as
[66:40] you're making sure that the keys get to
[66:42] the right people um and so this is where
[66:44] we think through documenting okay
[66:46] something happens to me here's where you
[66:48] find this information here's where my
[66:50] Hardware wallets are here's where my
[66:51] backups are um you know all of those
[66:54] different items that whomever will be
[66:56] receiving the Bitcoin whatever they
[66:58] would need to know is documented and
[67:00] they know where that document is so when
[67:02] the time comes they can go and access it
[67:06] that's the second thing third thing is
[67:08] education so okay we have the legal
[67:10] title passing to them we have uh our
[67:13] protocol in place to make sure that they
[67:14] get the keys now they need to be
[67:16] educated so that they can actually one
[67:19] access the Bitcoin two they don't just
[67:21] sell it you know they know what Bitcoin
[67:24] is to some extent they may not be
[67:26] willing to learn right now but if you
[67:29] put together a resource of hey reach out
[67:31] to this person maybe listen to Robin's
[67:33] podcast or you know whatever it is read
[67:35] this book Etc um you know you can help
[67:38] educate them at least when the time
[67:40] comes on what Bitcoin is so that they
[67:42] can actually implement it into their
[67:44] financial plan into their financial life
[67:46] and it doesn't just become a casualty of
[67:49] you know selling it uh for Fiat because
[67:51] they don't understand you know the the
[67:53] generational and Paradigm shifting asset
[67:56] um that Bitcoin can be so at a high
[67:58] level those are the three primary things
[68:00] that we work to take care of with for
[68:02] our clients and make sure that they have
[68:04] a complete plan in place so that there's
[68:07] no blind spots there's no legal issues
[68:09] no tax fraud issues and that the Bitcoin
[68:12] can actually pass to our kids to our
[68:15] family members whomever we want um so
[68:17] that they continue to benefit from it I
[68:19] love that yeah like uh we Mo most people
[68:22] are having to to start that Journey I
[68:25] think I've met too many bitcoiners uh
[68:29] where they don't have that plan yet like
[68:32] okay even though if even if you're young
[68:35] even if you're fit things can still
[68:37] happen so like PL plan for that as soon
[68:40] as you uh as soon as you are alive yeah
[68:44] for sure as as soon as you have
[68:46] something for yourself yeah really cool
[68:49] um uh I I wanted to get all with you
[68:52] into uh the connection between Bitcoin
[68:54] and God because mentioned it uh one two
[68:56] times and I think it it's an interesting
[68:59] uh conversation maybe we can get that uh
[69:01] in a little bit
[69:03] now um we had the guys on from thank God
[69:07] for Bitcoin we had Pastor coin on we had
[69:10] already a lot of people on that talked
[69:11] about like uh the the different uh
[69:15] values between kity the different values
[69:18] between bitcoiners where do you see the
[69:21] connection and and and I observe a big
[69:26] a big overlap between hardcore
[69:28] bitcoiners and actually like uh
[69:31] Christians obviously there's a lot of
[69:32] bitcoiners that that aren't Christians a
[69:34] lot of people that other religions or
[69:36] like uh no religion and and uh and stuff
[69:39] like that but I I I do have I do see a
[69:42] lot of overlap between Christianity and
[69:45] uh and and Bitcoin as where do you think
[69:48] that that connection is and and and why
[69:49] do you think that is yeah yeah
[69:52] absolutely um maybe before I I answer
[69:54] that one other thing on the estate
[69:55] planning piece just to wrap it all up is
[69:58] um it's important to think through your
[70:00] custody structure before going through
[70:02] all of this you know estate Bitcoin
[70:04] estate plan U because whatever custody
[70:07] structure you land on could change you
[70:09] know all of the you know how you
[70:10] implemented in the trust how you know
[70:12] how you document your inheritance
[70:13] protocol Etc so we've actually developed
[70:17] a a framework that we take all of our
[70:19] clients through it's 10 questions and it
[70:21] it brings in all the considerations that
[70:23] you need to think about when you're
[70:24] deciding what the best custody solution
[70:27] is for you in your your plan so whether
[70:30] it's single Sig single Sig with a p
[70:32] phrase or a pin on your wallet or it's
[70:35] you know Pure multi-sig or collaborative
[70:37] or multi-institutional you know we run
[70:38] the whole gamut um and so you know our
[70:41] framework helps us land on what solution
[70:44] is best you know for your specific
[70:46] situation before we go and start
[70:48] building out the the full estate plan
[70:49] from there so that's something to think
[70:51] about before you know going into all of
[70:54] that um
[70:55] other stuff that I mentioned but yeah I
[70:58] appreciate uh I always appreciate this
[71:00] conversation because um you know my my
[71:03] faith is foundational to obviously my
[71:05] personal life but it's also foundational
[71:07] to our business we get we we work with a
[71:10] lot of Christian bit bitcoiners and when
[71:14] those values align it really allows us
[71:16] to have these foundational conversations
[71:19] about you know our values how we want to
[71:22] live live out those values in the world
[71:25] um
[71:25] and it changes changes some of our
[71:27] conversations with folks uh but as as
[71:30] far as like where do I see alignment
[71:32] between Bitcoin and the Christian faith
[71:35] um I would say the two biggest things
[71:38] first is our Fiat system is a debt-based
[71:41] monetary
[71:43] system and there's a lot of problems
[71:46] with that that bitcoiners are aware of
[71:49] um but what what that essentially allows
[71:52] for is it allows for one stealing
[71:56] through inflation so you know whenever
[71:58] we are creating new money in the form of
[72:01] debt it is expanding the money supply
[72:03] and diluting the existing money out
[72:05] there um and so inflation is a form of
[72:08] theft and obviously you know the
[72:11] Christian faith is against stealing um
[72:14] and so Bitcoin you know it is an
[72:16] alternative monetary solution that is or
[72:19] monetary system that is not debt-based
[72:21] and can remove you know that theft from
[72:24] happening because it is the only digital
[72:27] scarce asset that you know we have and
[72:30] no one can manipulate and create more of
[72:32] it um so that first and foremost um and
[72:37] then Bitcoin you know it is a it is a
[72:40] monetary system based on truth and
[72:42] transparency so for me being a Christian
[72:45] I I see um you know the Bible as the
[72:51] only real truth in this world um is the
[72:55] source of Truth and so um you know our
[72:59] current Fiat monetary system is based
[73:02] you know around a lot of deception um it
[73:05] it distorts our world in many ways and
[73:08] so Bitcoin is is um potentially you know
[73:13] what can return our financial system and
[73:17] the downstream effects of our financial
[73:19] system to a foundation of truth that you
[73:23] know does not disproportionately
[73:27] um take from you know a large amount of
[73:30] the population for the benefit of the
[73:32] few um so those are the two primary
[73:34] things that I see as alignment between
[73:37] Bitcoin and the Christian faith um and
[73:40] so you know I I would love love love for
[73:42] more churches uh and other you know
[73:46] Christians to understand this alignment
[73:48] um because I think it can be
[73:51] transformational um you know for the
[73:54] kingdom the kingdom of god um but also
[73:56] for uh Christians and their their
[73:58] personal financial situation absolutely
[74:01] like we we have to orange pill all the
[74:05] churches the world we have a we have a
[74:07] lot of churches to go through uh and and
[74:11] do that yeah thank you so much that is
[74:12] really cool um I have one question to
[74:15] ask each and every one of my guests and
[74:17] the question is what can we learn from
[74:19] you besides
[74:21] Bitcoin good question interesting um
[74:26] let's see I mean you know for me when I
[74:29] typically answer answer these questions
[74:31] it does come back to Faith um because
[74:33] that is foundational uh to to my life
[74:37] and it it plays into absolutely
[74:39] everything that I do and so you know I
[74:42] would encourage any any bitcoiner or
[74:45] anyone listening if you are um you know
[74:49] if you are not a Believer you're not a
[74:51] Christian um you know I would just
[74:53] encourage you to seek it with an open
[74:55] mind like you may have with Bitcoin you
[74:57] know you came to bitcoin with an open
[74:59] mind and you did the research you sought
[75:02] you sought the truth and as you continue
[75:05] to try to um disprove yourself you know
[75:08] find what the issue is with Bitcoin you
[75:11] continue to get answers that
[75:12] resolidified your conviction if you
[75:15] approach the Christian faith in a
[75:17] similar way I think that you'll also get
[75:21] those same answers but you have to go
[75:23] about it with your ego down and with an
[75:25] open mind and seek truth and I believe
[75:29] that you will ultimately come to see uh
[75:31] that Jesus is the savior you know I I I
[75:34] regularly say that Bitcoin saved money
[75:37] but Jesus saved you saved our soul for
[75:41] eternity so um that's the the other
[75:44] direction outside of Bitcoin uh that I
[75:46] would encourage people to to listen to
[75:49] um and I understand you know all the
[75:51] hesitancies I was I was uh in the same
[75:54] place very very skeptical and and um you
[75:57] know more logical thinker maybe thinking
[76:00] that um you know can't can't believe it
