[00:00] you mentioned uh Monero before you're
[00:02] asking me to reveal my Wall of Shame
[00:04] aren't you have to ask this question
[00:06] unfortunately I'm Bitcoin only now
[00:08] what's your impressions of of Salvador
[00:10] I'd love to say that you can buy
[00:11] everything with Bitcoin but you can't so
[00:13] I've been twice I actually found that
[00:15] there was slightly fewer bases to pay
[00:17] with Bitcoin on my second visit than my
[00:19] first visit most of the country is still
[00:22] very much uh dollar based just the pr
[00:24] the country's got it really has put
[00:26] ourself door on the world stage what was
[00:28] you expecting before approve well that
[00:30] is a brilliant question so what I was
[00:32] expecting and I did there's no point
[00:34] denying this cuz I wrote about it quite
[00:36] extensively I did expect a very
[00:38] significant optic very quickly Bitcoin
[00:41] doesn't care what you do with it it
[00:42] doesn't stop someone in Africa using
[00:45] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or a
[00:47] store value in another country doesn't
[00:49] you know the Network's completely
[00:50] capable of dealing with all of
[00:53] this the first thing I noticed uh when I
[00:56] come across your profile and I
[00:57] researched a little bit about you was
[00:59] that you have a book called how to
[01:01] explain Bitcoin to your mom and this was
[01:04] this was nice because my mom has Bitcoin
[01:08] but she's not yes she has and she's not
[01:12] she's actually not a Bitcoin like she's
[01:15] not really convinced about it she's like
[01:17] oh it's some investing stuff some new
[01:19] stuff some Modern stuff and I always try
[01:23] to explain it to her but I did not go
[01:25] through that she really understands it
[01:27] but she has Bitcoin because she loves me
[01:30] that's basically the explanation uh but
[01:33] how do you explain Bitcoin to your mom
[01:35] like how can you how can I explain it
[01:37] better than my mom listen if it was easy
[01:41] I wouldn't have written an entire book
[01:44] um so you got to understand like in my
[01:46] case my mom uh I mean I put this into
[01:49] the introduction but my mom spent years
[01:52] telling people that I work for a company
[01:54] called
[01:55] microwave instead of a large well-known
[01:58] software company
[02:00] um so that was her kind of level of
[02:03] understanding of Technology now she
[02:06] still doesn't have the internet even to
[02:08] this day doesn't see the point of it um
[02:11] in fact she still blames me for the
[02:13] demise of the High Street because of the
[02:15] growth of the internet like it's somehow
[02:17] my fault for working a
[02:18] microwave um but um so so that's that's
[02:22] that's that's my starting point the
[02:24] other thing is she doesn't even have a
[02:27] mobile
[02:28] phone um so so that's how the technology
[02:31] I should say she has got a mobile phone
[02:33] now but it's a pay as you go one and she
[02:35] never turns it on because she doesn't
[02:36] like to waste the battery so um it it
[02:39] doesn't help us so look trying to go in
[02:42] and explain this was was impossible and
[02:44] I don't think either of us came out of
[02:46] it particularly well so that led to the
[02:48] inspiration of right if I can explain it
[02:50] to my mom in a book then we've got a
[02:54] chance of explaining it to anyone so I
[02:57] so I wrote this book it's quite old now
[02:58] though it's 2018 this book um but the
[03:02] the the concepts are still valid but
[03:04] some of the data is now out of date and
[03:06] I try to just explain a nice sort of
[03:07] friendly light-hearted slightly humorous
[03:10] way um very slow journey through money
[03:13] and why it's different and why you
[03:15] should look into it yeah it's
[03:17] interesting because uh in the the first
[03:19] stages when you try something to explain
[03:22] something simple and simple terms you're
[03:24] always like oh explain it to me like I'm
[03:26] 5 years old but it seems like young
[03:29] people like even under 10 years old they
[03:32] get Bitcoin quicker because they have uh
[03:35] digital things they value like they have
[03:37] a video game they buy skins they buy
[03:40] stuff digitally and they uh naturally
[03:43] add them with value they're like oh of
[03:46] course this digital thing has value so
[03:48] for them to jump to the conclusion oh
[03:50] yeah bigco also has value is sometimes
[03:52] easier for older folks that like as your
[03:56] mom is not even on the internet so
[03:58] that's that's an interesting
[04:00] thing to do like explain it to Mom not
[04:02] like a
[04:03] 5-year-old well exactly and that was the
[04:05] challenge but you're absolutely right
[04:07] because you know the Next Generation do
[04:09] already understand the concept of
[04:11] digital scarcity uh through you know
[04:13] boxes and games and that kind of stuff
[04:15] so they get it already it's not that big
[04:17] a leap but for my mom the whole thing
[04:19] was just so out there um it was it was
[04:22] tricky so that was the challenge she did
[04:24] read it by the way uh slightly under
[04:27] duress but she did read it uh and um I'm
[04:30] it's helped a bit but she hasn't got any
[04:32] Bitcoin so put it that way and you came
[04:35] into Bitcoin I think as you WR in the in
[04:38] the in your Twitter bio in 2016 which is
[04:41] an interesting time because you have the
[04:43] high in 2013 with like I think over
[04:45] th000 and in 2016 if I'm not mistaken
[04:50] it's it went never over the $1,000 Mark
[04:53] so it's like a a longer bare phase um
[04:56] but it was on the uprise how did you
[04:59] discover Bitcoin and how did you explain
[05:01] it to
[05:04] yourself uh well the first time
[05:06] discovered it actually uh was in 2013 so
[05:09] it was quite early on um and I actually
[05:12] read about it in a in a newspaper
[05:13] article just by chance was on the train
[05:16] and I read this thing and I couldn't
[05:18] understand it at all uh what they were
[05:20] talking about so of course I Googled it
[05:21] which was terrible mistake because um uh
[05:26] you know I was just inated with articles
[05:28] about why it was a scam and wouldn't
[05:30] work and having sort of an economic
[05:33] background uh I I googled this is even
[05:36] bigger mistake what do economists think
[05:39] of um Bitcoin so you know I've got Paul
[05:42] Krugman and Peter Shi and all these guys
[05:45] saying you know so disaster so I I left
[05:47] it alone and based on that tiny bit of
[05:50] research and I lost three
[05:52] years um because you know that Google
[05:54] search could have gone any could have
[05:56] gone a different way uh but it didn't uh
[05:59] and so those guys I've got a lot to
[06:00] answer for but um yeah ultimately I
[06:04] ended up uh taking the long way round so
[06:06] it was 16 when I decided look I'm G to
[06:09] have to buy some whether I understand it
[06:10] or not because I could see the number go
[06:12] up uh and that bit I did understand uh
[06:16] so I thought well I'll get some and I
[06:18] remember apologizing to my other half
[06:19] actually and I told her I'm so sorry
[06:21] I've left it so long because I really
[06:23] thought I was late right everyone thinks
[06:25] they're late to bitcoin
[06:26] everyone um so I apologize I I managed
[06:30] to get some uh managed to not lose it
[06:33] which was the next thing uh and that
[06:35] started me on learning about it and and
[06:38] you know as well Robin as everyone else
[06:39] once you actually make the decision to
[06:41] learn about it then the world opens up
[06:44] to you and you can't unse see it and on
[06:47] once you're in you're
[06:49] in that's interesting I had a similar
[06:51] experience I I mean but for me it was
[06:53] even uh more extreme because I've heard
[06:56] it the first time in 2017 I was 19 at
[06:59] the time uh and I dismissed it as a scam
[07:02] I was investing in in stocks I had quite
[07:06] few successes especially with Tesla I
[07:08] had I think also a little bit of luck uh
[07:11] there and I always dismissed as a scam
[07:13] because I wasn't the warm Buffett
[07:15] mindset asset has to have a cash flow
[07:18] it's go gold is nothing Bitcoin is
[07:20] nothing I had this kind of mindset and
[07:22] so in 20120 more people because of my
[07:25] successes in the stock market came up to
[07:27] me and said like oh what do you think of
[07:29] bcoin and I discovered that I don't have
[07:31] good arguments against Bitcoin actually
[07:34] and so I went on this uh weekend streak
[07:36] where I'm like this weekend I will get
[07:39] arguments against Bitcoin and on the
[07:42] quest of finding things against Bitcoin
[07:45] I discovered Bitcoin and I bought the
[07:48] Monday afterwards so it's it's
[07:50] interesting how people are getting
[07:51] orange build and how they they get into
[07:54] Bitcoin and it's it's it's crazy and
[07:57] it's this kind of motivation you get
[07:59] when you find Bitcoin as you are also I
[08:02] think you probably did something else
[08:04] before Bitcoin uh and you did
[08:07] not um uh speak so much about Bitcoin
[08:11] before you discovered Bitcoin like what
[08:13] did you do before and what didn't
[08:15] motivate you then talk so much about
[08:17] Bitcoin and write the book about it and
[08:19] explain it to so many
[08:21] people yeah it's quite big jump I
[08:23] suppose um and obviously you know as a
[08:27] uni can you believe in the late 80s
[08:29] so that's going back a while um and my
[08:33] degree was sort of management focused
[08:35] but I specialized actually in law um and
[08:38] I because I found it really interesting
[08:39] and I like to hear myself talk so I
[08:42] thought it be you know a barer or
[08:44] something it be pretty cool um but then
[08:46] I realized there was a lot of work
[08:48] involved with that uh and years of work
[08:50] so I thought right I'll do something
[08:52] easier I went into marketing because you
[08:54] just make that up really um and um you
[08:58] know found myself after a few years in
[09:00] the cward at Microsoft did five or six
[09:03] years at Microsoft and I actually
[09:04] started I started a number of little
[09:06] small businesses here and they always
[09:07] had an entrepreneurial sort of side uh
[09:10] and actually set up a chain of internet
[09:13] cafes and game zones around around the
[09:15] UK and what we call the Home counties
[09:16] here in the UK just at the time they
[09:19] really took off um so you know remember
[09:21] internet was terrible then so you know
[09:23] we paid something like 30 40,000 a year
[09:27] to have this I think it was 128 K line
[09:30] um yeah all the computer ship which was
[09:33] super fast at the time uh and then I
[09:35] just opened more and more of these um
[09:37] and actually it was towards the end of
[09:39] that Peri because I did it for years um
[09:42] you know running these uh these these
[09:44] different inter cafes we had 23
[09:46] employees at the peak of it so we did we
[09:48] did you know really go for it cool uh
[09:51] and we were the longest running chain
[09:53] and and I want say it's the largest
[09:54] chain in the UK um which wasn't saying
[09:56] very much because we didn't have that
[09:57] many branches but they were all
[10:00] Independents so when I finally did get
[10:03] my head around the Bitcoin thing the
[10:05] first thing I thought was how can I how
[10:07] can I mine This Not That I really
[10:09] understood it but I knew that I could
[10:10] mine I've missed the CPU days and I've
[10:12] missed the graphics card days but of
[10:14] course I did have all these computers so
[10:17] I realized I could mine Monero because
[10:19] you could do that with gpus uh and I
[10:22] thought well I can buy my Monero or sell
[10:24] my hash to nice hash uh and then I can
[10:28] you know acquire
[10:29] more Bitcoin so we're now this we're now
[10:31] in 17
[10:33] 2017 and all the time I'm reading about
[10:35] this and I'm thinking this is just like
[10:37] the internet was in the 90s and remember
[10:40] I was right at The Cutting Edge of that
[10:42] in the 90s as a young man and it was
[10:44] super
[10:45] exciting um I so I was about 24 25 it's
[10:50] probably around your age now I guess uh
[10:52] but you know it's helping Drive the
[10:54] adoption of the internet that was my
[10:55] role at Microsoft was was to do this so
[10:58] to have that experience was amazing and
[11:01] now as a much older man I'm thinking I
[11:03] could I could do this again I've got a
[11:04] second chance I mean how cool is that
[11:07] nobody gets to goes um so I thought
[11:10] right I've got to I've got to uh learn
[11:13] more about this so that was when um
[11:15] obviously I started ramping up the
[11:16] mining side using the downtime of the
[11:18] computers that led me to learning more
[11:20] about it and it led me ultimately to
[11:22] decision internet cafes coming to the
[11:24] end of their lifespan I need to sell
[11:26] these move somehow into Bitcoin didn't
[11:29] know how but I knew that I wanted to be
[11:31] involved I knew the buzz was the same
[11:33] this open source Network had the same if
[11:35] not greater power than the internet so I
[11:38] did that's what I did I sold the CAF
[11:39] sold them all and um just decided I'm
[11:44] gonna do Bitcoin that was it that's what
[11:46] say my M I'm going to do Bitcoin and she
[11:49] said what does that mean I said well I
[11:50] don't I don't really know yet uh I just
[11:53] know that I'm going to do Bitcoin uh and
[11:55] it just
[11:56] started uh similar to I think which is
[11:59] you know lots of lots of Twitter lots of
[12:02] learning lots of
[12:03] listening uh and and and it just things
[12:06] developed uh from there and uh great and
[12:10] I'm very very pleased I made that
[12:11] decision by the way was that the moment
[12:14] when re renewal blocks started and your
[12:18] Bitcoin driver
[12:21] career uh well that R box came much
[12:24] later that that's that's what's
[12:25] happening now um but up until then I
[12:28] mean I was I was doing some Consul work
[12:31] for um luno in the UK in fact I was
[12:33] running the Bitcoin pioneers and the
[12:36] Bitcoin polers uh communities here in
[12:38] the UK and the fact that only stopped
[12:41] really at the end of last year because
[12:43] the FCA RS um created all sorts of
[12:45] complications so we could really carry
[12:47] on in the format that it was
[12:49] running um uh but also I've been mining
[12:53] now large scale mining for five years um
[12:57] through Siberian mine uh who I got to
[13:00] know very well back in the early days as
[13:02] they were setting up uh and sort of
[13:04] maintain that sort of contact and
[13:07] relationship and you know spent some
[13:08] time actually on the mining
[13:10] facilities uh and I've really been
[13:12] ramping that up over the last year uh
[13:15] and then of course I think you're
[13:16] referring to um Bitcoin
[13:18] racing yeah uh you can probably see my
[13:21] uh my my suit still there but behind me
[13:25] uh looking at me sort of hoping that
[13:27] we'll have another season well we'll see
[13:28] right so I mean last year was last year
[13:31] was my rookie year as as as a racing
[13:33] driver 52 suddenly decided to become a
[13:36] racing
[13:37] driver uh uh with of course the Bitcoin
[13:39] racing team who I I bumped into um
[13:43] through the Bitcoin Pioneers uh work
[13:46] that I was doing they reached out we got
[13:47] to know each other got on really well
[13:49] then we all went together to El Salvador
[13:52] twice um to uh as guest of the
[13:55] government to um to meet with some
[13:57] senior people including the vice
[13:59] president and others uh to discuss um
[14:02] the endorsement of the team by El silor
[14:04] which they did give they did give their
[14:06] endorsement uh so that's why we have the
[14:08] flags on the roof and then of course we
[14:10] needed some more drivers we already had
[14:12] one great driver uh who's Chris McKenzie
[14:15] uh who's who's uh um uh part of the uh
[14:18] part of the team um part of the family
[14:21] that runs the team and so three other
[14:23] rookie drivers came in and I was one of
[14:25] them so uh what a fabulous year it was
[14:29] slightly terrifying uh but uh what a
[14:32] buzz amazing what what is uh renewa
[14:36] blocks actually all
[14:38] about well neblock is um I mean I've
[14:41] been working with these guys for some
[14:43] time I actually bought two and a half%
[14:45] of the company year or so ago I think
[14:47] because what they were trying to do was
[14:51] um kind of marry Bitcoin mining which of
[14:53] course you can tell I'm very passionate
[14:55] about with with uh renewable energy
[14:57] which I'm also passionate about but
[14:59] these guys really know their stuff when
[15:00] it comes to renewable energy um and the
[15:04] problem that we've got around the world
[15:06] with renewable energy is that when you
[15:09] you know want to put a for example a
[15:11] solar project together say you want to
[15:13] build a 20 megawatt solar project um and
[15:17] you say right we're going to build this
[15:19] and uh we're going to connect it up to
[15:21] um the grid and Bob your uncle off we go
[15:25] now the trouble is most national grids
[15:29] including in the UK uh and actually most
[15:32] National Grids really I can think of uh
[15:34] are really designed for sort of
[15:36] centralized stable power sources they're
[15:38] not really designed for variable
[15:41] decentralized power sources so now
[15:44] whenever you bring these things online
[15:47] you've got to upgrade the infrastructure
[15:49] and in some cases it's really difficult
[15:50] and really expensive and it can take
[15:52] years I mean there are waiting times of
[15:55] over a
[15:56] decade uh and you can end up with
[15:58] situation where projects are actually
[15:59] being built and then can't be connected
[16:02] I mean there's actually a few quite
[16:03] famous examples in the UK so power's
[16:05] being produced it doesn't go
[16:08] anywhere which is madness right I mean
[16:11] obviously don't normally get to that
[16:12] stage is you know nor don't build it out
[16:14] until they're closer but it does happen
[16:16] so what we've done is we've said okay
[16:19] let's model out what would happen if we
[16:21] could monitize that energy before it's
[16:25] connected to the grid so can we come up
[16:27] with a kind of bespoke solution where we
[16:30] can rock up uh agree terms with that
[16:33] energy provider whatever stage they're
[16:35] at uh and say right we can monetize that
[16:39] power in in in the early stages and you
[16:41] could do that as a partnership could as
[16:42] a joint venture you could literally sell
[16:44] us the power um there's all kinds of
[16:47] different bespoke ways that we could do
[16:48] that so that was the concept uh and
[16:51] we've um explore this over quite a long
[16:54] period of time then I joined the company
[16:56] it's only a small startup just a handful
[16:58] of guys
[16:59] uh as Chief Operating Officer in um
[17:02] October and that then took on 10% of the
[17:04] company um and uh in the meantime we've
[17:08] we've we've got some uh Partners in
[17:11] America joint venture that we've we've
[17:13] signed there we've acquired 160 acres of
[17:15] land to deploy our first operation
[17:18] that's going to be solar and Bitcoin
[17:20] mining it's kind of a proof of concept
[17:23] but also there's a good Revenue
[17:25] opportunity there as well and we have a
[17:26] number of Lees with other things that we
[17:28] look at and actually as it happens we're
[17:30] in a we're in a seed raid uh seed raid
[17:33] round now and if you want to find out
[17:35] more about this because I'll talk about
[17:37] this all day so better to move on before
[17:38] I really go off on one but um um I would
[17:41] say to you look if if you're interested
[17:43] in having a look at what we're we're
[17:44] doing here because we have attracted
[17:46] quite a lot of interest on some of the
[17:48] you know some of the more prominent
[17:50] names in in the industry as well we
[17:53] we'll we'll we'll reveal more on that
[17:55] later on um but you can go to uh our we
[17:59] funder page which is we funder renew
[18:02] blocks sorry wefunder.com renew blocks I
[18:05] think it is check it out um we'll put it
[18:07] in the show notes anyway I'm sure but uh
[18:09] it's it's a great opportunity it's open
[18:11] now it's only open for another couple of
[18:13] months and you can invest we've made it
[18:15] so anyone can invest as well so you get
[18:16] the same terms if you're investing $100
[18:19] as if you're investing H 100,000 um so
[18:22] yeah check it out it's I love it it's
[18:24] really interesting and I'm I'm really
[18:27] looking forward to working this project
[18:28] for the next few years yeah it will be
[18:30] everywhere in the show notes and of
[18:32] course also uh this podcast will be also
[18:35] launched on X directly so people can
[18:38] just click on your tag and see your
[18:41] profile and I think it's already also in
[18:43] the bio in there um
[18:47] yeah future of mining I always like I I
[18:50] really like the example with Texas where
[18:53] they balance the crit with the the
[18:56] miners you also bring in next example in
[18:58] there where uh big grits that are
[19:01] getting launched and maybe need a
[19:03] monetization till they actually getting
[19:05] launched uh that's amazing where do you
[19:08] see like Bitcoin mining in evolving uh
[19:11] from like 10 15 years ago where every BC
[19:15] could mine Bitcoin now we're at this
[19:17] stage where it gets really big and a
[19:19] massive business also where public
[19:21] companies are involved or Bitcoin mining
[19:23] companies are public companies how do
[19:25] you see it evolving in the next like 10
[19:27] 20 years
[19:30] I mean that's an amazingly long time
[19:32] scale for for Bitcoin of course and
[19:34] we're only 15 years in now and to be
[19:37] honest we are this is part of the
[19:38] excitement of it right I mean we are
[19:40] forging A New Path and no one's really
[19:43] sure what direction we we're going to go
[19:45] in I think the things we can be fairly
[19:48] certain about is that the relationship
[19:50] between renewable energy and Bitcoin
[19:52] mining is just going to keep growing and
[19:55] I think those two industries will come
[19:56] closer and closer together I mean the
[19:58] stuff we talk about renewal blocks is is
[20:00] is a good example of that and there will
[20:01] be other people who who do similar
[20:03] things or or go off in slightly
[20:05] different directions but I I think
[20:06] that's inevitable
[20:09] um there's lots of different ways we
[20:11] could go with this
[20:13] because you know there there is concern
[20:15] for example about decentralization sorry
[20:18] about centralization of of mining uh and
[20:21] in some ways that's a fair argument
[20:24] because you it could be one of those
[20:26] things you know one of the arguments we
[20:27] always say about proof of stake is it's
[20:29] really not you know it's about who's got
[20:31] the most money ultimately right so you
[20:33] can force your way into the network of
[20:35] money it's not quite the same with
[20:37] Bitcoin but you can kind of see the
[20:39] argument if someone comes along they
[20:42] hundred million dollars and they buy
[20:43] aund millionar of mines and they've got
[20:45] a good arrangement which they could
[20:47] probably force with $100 million of
[20:49] mining then you can argue there's a case
[20:52] of centralization there it's not quite
[20:55] to the same degree um but it it it's
[20:59] it's an angle I don't think we have any
[21:01] cause for concern right now just for the
[21:03] record by the way um maybe in five 10 15
[21:07] years time there might be it's a trend
[21:10] that we have to uh keep an eye on um but
[21:15] uh you know the rest of this answer is
[21:17] pretty vague because we don't really
[21:20] know where we're going to go but I do
[21:22] see renewable energy Bitcoin mining more
[21:25] hand in hand I do see the hash rate
[21:27] Contin to go up I do see difficulty
[21:29] continuing to go up uh and I do see I
[21:33] you know continued innovation in the
[21:35] actual minus themselves so I think those
[21:38] things we can be certain of the actual
[21:39] shape I don't know yet does it surprise
[21:42] you that the hash R is going up like in
[21:46] a straight line basically and the price
[21:50] of Bitcoin is like not like it's not
[21:53] coupled in any ways right now at least
[21:55] when you look at the shter maybe if you
[21:57] look like five 10 year Trends then it's
[21:59] kind of coupled but if you look at the
[22:01] short-term Trends it's just seems like
[22:03] more Bitcoin maners are going online
[22:05] more in investment in Bitcoin miners uh
[22:08] and we're not even close to the to the
[22:10] alltime high of Bitcoin from
[22:13] 2021 yeah I mean you're right because if
[22:15] you do look if you zoom out and look at
[22:17] that hash rate chart it is almost you
[22:18] know straight up to the right if you do
[22:20] sort of a trend line um you know it
[22:22] doesn't really surprise me and I don't
[22:24] think that's going to change anytime um
[22:27] soon um there are a lot of people and I
[22:31] I do disagree with this actually most of
[22:33] the time there are a lot of people say
[22:34] oh yeah bitcoin's reached a new um high
[22:37] in terms of hash rate so price will
[22:39] follow I don't necessarily agree with
[22:42] that because in many ways it's sort of a
[22:44] production cost um and that's kind of
[22:48] separate from the market side of Bitcoin
[22:50] if you're into trading and stuff I mean
[22:51] this is not really my era because I'm I
[22:53] don't trade I've written a couple of
[22:55] articles about trading and basically
[22:57] telling people just how rubbish I am at
[22:58] it so that's why I don't trade um so I
[23:01] just think longterm and invest long term
[23:04] um so I don't necessarily agree that the
[23:07] cost of production really should does
[23:09] Drive the market uh although you know
[23:11] I've had long debates with people over
[23:13] that particular Point um so yeah we it's
[23:16] really a measure of confidence isn't it
[23:19] you know miners will not deploy unless
[23:21] they are confident in Bitcoin itself
[23:23] their own bottom lines and and the
[23:25] future that's it so hash really is a
[23:28] measure of minor confidence I'm a minor
[23:30] I'm very confident I've been adding to
[23:32] my fleet um quite significantly in in
[23:35] the last couple of months even though
[23:38] the Bitcoin price is lower because I do
[23:40] believe longterm it will be um higher
[23:44] and I do believe that you have to now
[23:45] factor in the Haring because that's what
[23:48] that's only 90 or days away I don't know
[23:50] how many is somewhere around 90 days um
[23:53] so uh so now you got to think ahead
[23:55] because I've already mined through on a
[23:57] large scale what one halfing and and you
[23:59] know the Dynamics do change it does get
[24:00] a bit crazy for a for for a little while
[24:03] leading up to it and afterwards I'm
[24:05] super excited to announce that this
[24:07] podcast just got the first ever sponsor
[24:11] I just started the podcast out like
[24:13] three months ago and now we have 21
[24:17] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[24:21] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[24:25] they teach and preach self custody this
[24:28] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[24:32] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[24:34] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[24:39] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[24:41] time support this podcast use code Robin
[24:45] and click the link in the description
[24:47] how does the manic change in the in the
[24:49] Haring cycle for the miners like the
[24:51] rewards obviously get half uh but how do
[24:55] how does that play out on like half on
[24:57] on the mining
[24:59] side well I mean last time around for
[25:01] example on the buildup to it uh everyone
[25:04] switched pretty much everything on um
[25:07] right so it didn't matter how crappy
[25:09] your old machines were you you know
[25:10] you're ramping them up to try and get
[25:12] that uh uh that reward before it um
[25:16] before it half to where to where it is
[25:18] now so was uh that was Lot 12.5 wasn't
[25:20] it before so um but straight afterwards
[25:23] there was a fairly rapid decline in hash
[25:26] rate because of of course those machines
[25:28] a lot of those machines then immediately
[25:30] became unviable so you shut it down you
[25:33] just saw this kind of really quite sharp
[25:35] line downwards uh which of course then
[25:38] adjusted the difficulty which kind of
[25:40] offset some of the Haring so there this
[25:42] wonderful dance between this hash rate
[25:44] and difficulty uh but then it will
[25:46] stabilize over time you'll see that you
[25:48] know you know cre back up again so we I
[25:52] expect we'll see the same thing I expect
[25:53] everyone will power everything up right
[25:55] up to the last minute um but the are a
[25:58] lot of old gem machines out there still
[26:00] still operating which will um finally
[26:02] reach uh end of life um and they will be
[26:06] they will be they'll be scrapped or some
[26:07] people will keep them just in case
[26:09] because sometimes it can go crazy again
[26:11] and you know you can get a little bit
[26:13] can squeeze a little bit more juice
[26:16] out it's it's h it's my first having
[26:19] actually because I got in in 20120 but
[26:22] kind of after the Haring so it's my
[26:24] first Haring where I'm really involved
[26:26] in the Bitcoin community
[26:28] and I'm really looking forward to it
[26:29] like if people are like looking forward
[26:32] to it like the Super Bowl it's it's an
[26:34] similar event
[26:37] community and yeah I mean as a miner it
[26:40] is it is on your mind quite a lot
[26:42] because you you have to plan correctly
[26:46] um because you know you can you can get
[26:48] this wrong uh and um you know I me for
[26:51] example there's a lot of really quite
[26:52] cheap miners around the moment which are
[26:54] sort of 40 42 wats terahash that's
[26:57] really high uh because obviously the new
[26:59] generation is is 1x you know sort of 18
[27:03] 19 something like that so those go guys
[27:05] are really going to dominate in the next
[27:08] uh in the next cycle Yeah you mentioned
[27:12] uh Monero before and uh I posted
[27:16] something before that you always come in
[27:19] because of Bitcoin and then a lot of
[27:21] Cycles go and also my journey was like
[27:23] that that you got into Bitcoin then you
[27:26] get a lot of cryptos your portfolio and
[27:28] get like the crypto expert and then all
[27:30] of the sudden to the end it gets the
[27:33] Bitcoin only portfolio at least a lot of
[27:35] people have that uh experience did you
[27:37] also experienced with altcoins or are
[27:40] you still experienced with altcoins how
[27:43] is your portf uh you're asking me to
[27:45] reveal my Wall of Shame aren't you um
[27:48] yeah
[27:50] I rather have to ask this question
[27:53] unfortunately yeah I mean look I'm
[27:56] Bitcoin only now
[27:58] um and but I I think the journey I think
[28:00] you've described it perfectly I think
[28:02] it's normal for most people you discover
[28:05] Bitcoin for for me it was Bitcoin and
[28:07] then the other coins sometimes I know
[28:08] it's the other way around is crypto and
[28:10] then Bitcoin um so I got Bitcoin and
[28:13] then fell for all the this coin's going
[28:15] to be better than Bitcoin stuff before I
[28:17] understood uh the tech behind it the
[28:20] before I understood the centralization
[28:21] and the control and the way that um you
[28:24] know crypto basically like equities
[28:26] really um um in the sense that they're
[28:30] you're really betting on a company and a
[28:31] group of people effectively you know um
[28:36] so yeah I did I did it I I I I played
[28:40] with everything I think I had I I think
[28:43] I had it all at one stage I Neo uh
[28:47] kadano Iota xrp I wrote a couple of
[28:49] articles about xrp um e um I mean I had
[28:54] about 50 I think I'm not going to list
[28:56] them all but there were in there uh most
[28:59] of which have have gone now but actually
[29:00] I mean still got some stuff from the old
[29:02] days still sitting in in in wallet
[29:04] somewhere and I always say that soon as
[29:07] the next cycle comes along I'll just get
[29:09] rid of those and move into Bitcoin yeah
[29:13] I also got rid of I think the last kind
[29:15] of
[29:16] dust it was like a year ago I went
[29:20] through everything and then I discovered
[29:22] one metam mask wallet from the old days
[29:25] then I was like oh there's the there's
[29:27] the something in it that was like $100
[29:28] worth of something and I just uh quickly
[29:32] converted it to bitcoin and now I got
[29:34] really clean yeah yeah you you're
[29:37] completely clean now yeah I'm still I
[29:39] say I've still got I've still got some
[29:40] stuff hanging around but um it's it's
[29:42] ear marked um for disposal at the right
[29:46] time I mean if I could turn it into a
[29:47] couple of miners I'd be very happy with
[29:49] that yeah you have is there a El
[29:52] Salvador flag in the in the background I
[29:54] wondered that it is yeah y yeah uh so
[29:59] I've been out there a couple of times I
[30:00] love the place what's your uh
[30:02] impressions of of El Salvador and the
[30:04] option there I never was there and I
[30:06] really want to go there this November
[30:09] with the Bitcoin adoption with the
[30:11] conference and I always wondered like
[30:14] this is Bitcoin for me is a bottom up
[30:17] approach like in the in the in the most
[30:19] basic sense but Salvador is kind of a
[30:22] top down like it of course it started
[30:24] with Bitcoin Beach and it was kind of a
[30:26] Grassroots movement but then president
[30:29] pushed it from the top down also how do
[30:31] you see the the adoption there can you
[30:33] buy everything with Bitcoin there is
[30:35] like how's the experience if you can
[30:37] share yeah I mean I I'd love to say that
[30:41] you can buy everything with Bitcoin but
[30:42] you can't uh it is a long long way to go
[30:47] um so I've been twice uh my last visit
[30:53] it was yeah last year so um so yes been
[30:57] yes it was a year ago um almost um so I
[31:00] actually found that there were slightly
[31:01] fewer places to pay with Bitcoin on my
[31:04] second visit than my first visit um and
[31:08] actually uh most of the time I was in
[31:10] San Salvador which is the capital
[31:11] obviously went over to Elon well check
[31:13] that out um and there reasonable number
[31:17] of places you can pay with Bitcoin um
[31:20] and of course I did the obligatory
[31:21] buying coffee videos and McDonald's
[31:24] videos um but lots of independent
[31:26] Traders as well now outside of the
[31:29] city um really there's very few places
[31:33] uh apart from elante and a couple of
[31:35] other little hotpots um but most of the
[31:37] country is still very much uh dollar
[31:40] based now I can also say there is a lot
[31:43] of focus on education and promotion so I
[31:47] do think this will change um over time
[31:50] but it's not it's not a short job and I
[31:52] don't think B ever considered it to be a
[31:54] short job I think he realized this was
[31:56] going to be
[31:58] you know a long long slog but they seem
[32:01] to be up for it and and there's no
[32:03] there's no question that the country is
[32:05] very upbeat uh it's very confident it's
[32:07] very relaxed um I I find it quite
[32:10] emotional actually because you can see
[32:13] the Hope in people's eyes which was not
[32:17] there before when the gangs were running
[32:19] the place and they really did run the
[32:21] place so these people they think I can
[32:23] go for a walk I can start a business I
[32:25] can I I can I can do stuff without
[32:27] worrying about getting killed or
[32:29] kidnapped um it's incredible so there's
[32:32] a lot of opportunity there and that that
[32:34] that really came across to me uh and uh
[32:37] I I think that country really is going
[32:40] places that's amazing yeah I always I
[32:43] look closely at that place and I had
[32:46] like two people on that I actually
[32:48] almost kind of living uh in the in in El
[32:51] Salvador they're not 100% there but
[32:54] they're like 40 50% there and uh
[32:58] actually tomorrow I have a couple there
[32:59] that both uh moved there and they shared
[33:03] the story also online and I'm really
[33:05] looking forward to that one and it's
[33:09] interesting to see because na P
[33:12] basically took the adoption of Bitcoin
[33:15] and moved it forward in his own country
[33:18] uh with the hopes that a lot of Bitcoin
[33:20] businesses and Bitcoin itself bring hope
[33:22] to the country with a lot of economic
[33:25] power and with a lot of um yeah good
[33:28] people that have a lot of bright Minds
[33:30] in them and I think he will do really
[33:34] good yeah I think so I mean you've see
[33:36] just the pr the country's got uh as well
[33:39] I mean it really has put El elor on the
[33:42] world stage I mean obviously we can say
[33:43] well look we maybe we're a little bit
[33:45] blinkered because we're looking at you
[33:47] know X but actually it's out there
[33:49] mainstream media normally people bashing
[33:52] it uh particularly you know anything
[33:54] which is linked to the IMF and any
[33:56] tradire stuff just trying to really give
[33:59] them a hard time um but I think it's
[34:02] Unstoppable uh and uh they are they I
[34:06] reckon they're going to do it I really
[34:08] do yeah me too um I saw also some AR
[34:14] articles on on medium of you and the one
[34:17] that stood out to me was the Bitcoin ETF
[34:19] one I followed the Bitcoin ETF quite
[34:22] closely uh and you basically said uh
[34:27] like you made an article what will
[34:29] happen once the Bitcoin ETF appr will be
[34:32] approved I think the the effects of the
[34:34] Bitcoin EF will be more longterm it's
[34:36] not lot like oh it's going to be
[34:37] approved and it's in that day a lot of
[34:40] things happening and a lot of people
[34:42] hoped for like a god candle with 100K in
[34:44] the first
[34:46] hour um what what was your expecting uh
[34:49] before the approval and uh how how how
[34:52] were you surprised or how were your
[34:54] expectations met uh well that is a
[34:58] brilliant question there's a long way
[34:59] there's a lot of places we can go with
[35:01] this one as well but uh let me try and
[35:03] summarize it a bit I mean I actually
[35:05] wrote I think six or seven articles on
[35:07] the ETF leading up to it so will we have
[35:10] one what will happen uh what will happen
[35:12] if it isn't approved uh what needs to
[35:15] happen so i' I've really got quite into
[35:17] the whole ETF idea because obviously
[35:19] we've been talking about it for 10 years
[35:21] I mean the winkos twins put their
[35:23] application in 2013 it's incredible
[35:26] really
[35:27] uh excuse me so um so what I was
[35:31] expecting and I did there's no point
[35:34] denying this because I wrote about it
[35:35] quite extensively I did expect uh a very
[35:39] significant uptick very quickly uh and I
[35:43] based that on the fact that we'd had two
[35:44] dry runs so we had the coin Telegraph
[35:47] announcement remember that in October oh
[35:49] yes yes approved and immediately we saw
[35:52] an uptick and that was only a small
[35:53] number of people really who saw that
[35:55] because it was retracted very quick
[35:56] quickly and disprove very quickly and
[35:59] yet we had this really significant move
[36:02] um so clearly there were people waiting
[36:03] for this it wasn't priced in at that
[36:05] point then of course we had the SEC hack
[36:08] or whatever you want to call it um and
[36:10] we had the same thing right we had
[36:12] another move so so I thought we by then
[36:14] I was totally convinced right we've seen
[36:15] it twice obviously as soon as this
[36:18] approval happens we're going to see this
[36:20] massive uptick and then of course and
[36:23] I'm sure you were funny as close hours I
[36:24] mean the day was just a disaster
[36:27] uh because um you know we obviously had
[36:30] that problem uh and then they did
[36:32] announce it but no one was convinced
[36:34] then that it was real and then they put
[36:36] it on the website the website went down
[36:38] did you see that right so the actual
[36:40] announcement fell off the website so at
[36:43] that point every was like I'm not
[36:44] getting involved with this until we
[36:46] absolutely know what's going on here so
[36:47] by the time we got to that sort of third
[36:49] time round every was going I'm not
[36:51] moving so I know what everyone else is
[36:53] going to do so I think we lost the
[36:56] opportunity for that kind of speculative
[36:58] trading candle to Happ because the
[36:59] momentum never materialized and you know
[37:02] as well as I it's all about momentum
[37:04] right soon you move quickly you know you
[37:06] liquidate the shorts and that that
[37:08] creates more momentum off youo so we
[37:11] didn't get that part but I didn't factor
[37:14] in and I'm not sure many of us did
[37:16] really um the outflows From Grace scale
[37:21] in the first few days were that
[37:23] significant um that really they they
[37:26] offset
[37:27] uh a lot of the inflows uh and therefore
[37:29] the market price natural fact we've
[37:31] we've traded pretty much sideways as a
[37:33] result ever since so we are going to see
[37:35] a longer term effect you know I've got
[37:37] no doubt about that but I did expect to
[37:40] be a much bigger impact earlier on and
[37:43] so I stand
[37:45] corrected I mean the the the S hack I
[37:49] think it really tried it down and made
[37:51] everyone unsure because I had two live
[37:55] streams on uh on the second day when it
[37:59] was announced and on the first day it
[38:01] was announced uh I was a little late and
[38:04] I was was already going to sleep and I
[38:06] was like what it's announced and then I
[38:08] was like seeing it and then I was like
[38:10] oh it's the official account then I
[38:11] posted like a a thing that I already
[38:14] prepared when it's approved and I posted
[38:17] it that post like I have 8,000 followers
[38:20] I usually get when a post performance
[38:22] good maybe three to 4,000 views in the
[38:25] first hour that post got five to 6,000
[38:28] views in the first I don't know 10
[38:30] minutes five minutes like it went
[38:34] completely insane uh and I got like 100
[38:37] messages it's not approved it's not
[38:38] approved it's not approved it's not yeah
[38:41] yeah then I was what what are what are
[38:43] you speaking about and then I was like
[38:46] going to the SEC account like and then I
[38:49] was going uh to the everybody's like
[38:52] Gary GLE Gary GLE and I was like what
[38:55] heck when who do trust now Gary Gensler
[38:58] or the I mean what a bizarre thing it
[39:02] really was and and then on the next day
[39:05] of course um I I looked at the streams
[39:08] and people are like this document comes
[39:11] out uh that exchange listed that this is
[39:15] coming out and it's like okay it seems
[39:18] more more logical more and more people
[39:20] saying oh it will come it will come but
[39:22] it was not that okay now it came like
[39:25] that moment never was there is like it
[39:26] was was like spread over a long longer
[39:29] period of time and this as you said it
[39:31] destroyed momentum so 100% agree with
[39:34] you yeah yeah yeah and I think that
[39:36] would that would have changed things you
[39:38] know I think it there would have been
[39:39] that speculative but I mean probably
[39:41] would have come down again actually
[39:43] given what we now know with with the
[39:44] outflows and what have you but uh so
[39:47] maybe you know leverage Traders will
[39:50] very pleased about that but um um but
[39:53] they should be doing it in the first
[39:54] place uh so we'll never never know right
[39:57] we'll never know it is what it is but we
[39:58] know the long-term effect we can be
[40:00] fairly clear about that I think what do
[40:03] you see about the long-term effects like
[40:05] I think there's just an an enormous
[40:07] amount of uh like First Capital coming
[40:10] in in the space that is unlocked and the
[40:12] second part is like there's a lot of
[40:14] eyeballs also coming in and a lot of uh
[40:18] older people that first did not speak
[40:20] about Bitcoin all of the sudden speak
[40:22] about Bitcoin and all the salesperson
[40:24] also about the in the ETFs and the funds
[40:27] that all of the sudden saying to all the
[40:29] clients and the high netw worth
[40:31] individuals buy Bitcoin see we have also
[40:33] this now in the thing and like how do
[40:35] you see this all playing out in the like
[40:37] next few
[40:39] years yeah well I think there's several
[40:41] things I mean look those they weren't
[40:43] shy about putting their TV ads out right
[40:45] because we've all seen those on Twitter
[40:47] and they they do vary in quality quite a
[40:49] lot but the point is um they went out
[40:52] and they spent a chunk of money on on
[40:55] promoting it but you also know that
[40:57] behind the
[40:58] scenes uh there they going to be a lot
[41:01] of really sales people going out and
[41:03] pitching clients and pitching the
[41:05] middlemen who deal with clients to
[41:08] really sort of tell people this Bitcoin
[41:10] thing is pretty cool you can put some
[41:12] money and you can do it now you can do
[41:13] it with us um so whether you know the
[41:17] main operators Behind these
[41:19] organizations really understand Bitcoin
[41:21] we know some of them do we're not 100%
[41:23] sure on some of them um whe their
[41:26] objective is to drive Bitcoin which I
[41:28] don't think it is so much or to generate
[41:30] revenues which I think it probably is
[41:32] more to do with um they are going to go
[41:34] and sell this and that they're going to
[41:36] sell it on quite a large scale for quite
[41:38] a long time because they know there is a
[41:41] latent interest to some to some degree
[41:43] so I you know that's that's the main
[41:45] thing is is they now switch from being
[41:49] either passive or um or or neutral or or
[41:52] not promoting to switching to going out
[41:55] there and be massively you know
[41:56] promoting in any way shape or form they
[41:58] can I mean I'll be interested to see
[41:59] what the Super Bowl ads are this year
[42:01] but I wouldn't be surprised if we see
[42:03] some quite significant ETF ads in there
[42:06] uh so we'll see but that's that's the
[42:08] biggest change so that will take time to
[42:09] filter through um and we can argue you
[42:12] know whether it's a good thing for
[42:14] Bitcoin or not because I know there's
[42:15] there's two sides to to that argument as
[42:17] well but um you know ultimately they
[42:20] will be hoovering up big chunks of bcoin
[42:23] uh and it will go into their funds
[42:26] yeah I mean the argument about oh is it
[42:29] good or bad about Bitcoin I think it's
[42:31] it's pretty easy I think because if
[42:33] Bitcoin is actually the sound money as
[42:35] we all see that's this the the the
[42:37] resistant asset that it that we are
[42:39] seeing it if a Bitcoin ETF kills it then
[42:42] it was never that what we thought it is
[42:45] so you're absolutely right that's a
[42:47] really simple statement but it's a
[42:48] really effective one and the thing is
[42:51] you know as I always say to these people
[42:52] you know they're going to hold this
[42:54] money and they can do this said well it
[42:56] it doesn't really matter I mean you know
[42:58] Bitcoin doesn't care what you do with it
[43:00] it doesn't stop someone in Africa using
[43:03] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange or a
[43:05] store value in another country doesn't
[43:07] you know the Network's completely
[43:09] capable of dealing with all of this
[43:11] simultaneously is kind of irrelevant
[43:13] what we do with it it's just going to
[43:14] keep ticking over um so there's room
[43:18] there's room for for all of it even
[43:20] though at at first it doesn't seem that
[43:22] way numerically right because you just
[43:23] think oh 21 million coins it can't be
[43:25] done but actually course you and I both
[43:28] know that that's not quite how that
[43:30] works that's that's very true yeah um
[43:34] we're coming closer to the end and we're
[43:36] having an interesting end routine in the
[43:38] in the podcast where the previous guest
[43:41] asked the next guest without knowing
[43:43] who's the next guest is a question and
[43:46] uh your question is when is the last
[43:48] time you paid for something in Bitcoin
[43:50] and which product and services would you
[43:53] like to pay in Bitcoin in the future
[43:57] uh probably I would normally say
[44:00] everything because I like to have that
[44:01] choice I always ask if I you know if I
[44:04] go to a restaurant something I always my
[44:06] family rolls the rise sometimes but I
[44:07] always say um you know do you accept
[44:09] Bitcoin uh usually KN the answer is no
[44:12] but I always think you know if everyone
[44:14] ask that question it'll it'll catch on
[44:16] over time uh the last thing I actually
[44:18] bought with Bitcoin was a pint of beer
[44:20] um there is uh uh there's obviously a
[44:24] few pubs around now but there are
[44:25] companies it's like bridge to bitcoin
[44:26] you go around setting these uh these
[44:29] these places up so um I think it was
[44:31] before Christmas though so it's been a
[44:33] good month I think um it's actually
[44:35] because I'm a bit tight on the Bitcoin
[44:36] as well I should make that clear um so
[44:39] uh but that was a couple of points of
[44:41] beer at the pub um so that that was my
[44:44] last purchase that's an amazing uh
[44:47] strategy to keep just asking about
[44:49] Bitcoin uh
[44:51] I um you know Red Bull probably it's an
[44:54] Austrian company the energy drinks and
[44:57] in the beginning uh the mait founder
[45:01] tried to get into all the restaurants
[45:03] but nobody knew Red Bull and nobody
[45:06] liked Red Bull it's like it was like you
[45:08] have to get in the restaurant so you get
[45:10] to the contribution that everybody is
[45:12] known and he just paid people in the
[45:14] Disco and the restaurants to ask for R
[45:17] he's like here you have 10 please ask
[45:20] for Red Bull he have 10 and ask for Red
[45:23] Bull and and so that way got a more
[45:28] leverage when he goes to the restaurant
[45:30] or the Disco or the pup uh oh would you
[45:34] like to also feature Red Bull in your in
[45:36] your um beverage thing and and it's kind
[45:39] of the same thing we are doing as a bit
[45:42] coiners they're really hardcore bit
[45:44] coers and I try to do it I don't do it
[45:46] as much as I should do it but uh every
[45:49] time some Bitcoin asks for can I buy in
[45:53] Bitcoin in this it's in their mind it's
[45:56] it's something that came up and if it's
[45:58] the second time a guy asked in a week or
[46:00] the third time or a fifth time it will
[46:03] be a discussion uh at some point in some
[46:05] business meetings and it it's just it's
[46:08] that Grassroots movement that slowly
[46:10] gets more and more people in and we need
[46:13] that for sure so it's it's I highly
[46:16] appreciate every bitcoiner that does
[46:18] that because it's kind of awkward in
[46:20] public but it's kind of
[46:22] necessary I think so and it's kind of
[46:25] fun I mean you know you do get a range
[46:27] of responses you don't really often get
[46:30] I don't know what that is anymore
[46:32] confusion you know now it's changed over
[46:34] the years uh so quite often you still
[46:37] obviously get mostly a no uh but every
[46:41] now and again it can lead to you know
[46:42] interesting conversation I've heard of
[46:44] that what what is that and so on and so
[46:46] forth so that's what we want more of
[46:48] right and just over time we'll uh we'll
[46:51] get there I also have one more thing in
[46:54] that regard there are like lightning
[46:56] tips company where you can just print a
[46:59] a page out with QR codes on there and
[47:02] you can preload them with a few set does
[47:05] and you can basically tip the waiters uh
[47:08] Bitcoin with it and you can also uh SE
[47:11] in your dashboard then oh uh like from
[47:15] 10 10 tips I gave out five already
[47:17] redeemed then whatever they are doing
[47:20] with it but they basically had to deal
[47:21] with the lightning Network they had to
[47:22] deal with Bitcoin to redeem it uh that's
[47:26] also a nice way to introduce Bitcoin in
[47:28] the public where you're just like oh I
[47:30] give you like a few fear tips but
[47:32] there's also a to dip uh for for you and
[47:37] you know that's a really obvious thing
[47:39] to do and I don't know why I haven't
[47:40] thought of that I mean you know I I have
[47:43] I have set people up with lightning wets
[47:45] and and and done it that way but that's
[47:46] even easier fact you could just put a
[47:48] couple of lines of information you know
[47:50] where to get more information on this
[47:51] and what's just happened there's all
[47:54] kinds of stuff you could do with that
[47:55] it's pretty OB actually yeah I forgot
[47:57] the company that is doing that it's just
[47:59] a side where you can just download it I
[48:01] tried it I I did it once at Christmas
[48:04] and I gave everybody in my family just a
[48:07] cards so and did anyone take it you know
[48:10] yes yes yes everybody took it but it's
[48:12] it I I have a hard time in my family
[48:15] like uh the closer people are to me the
[48:18] more they have Bitcoin it's like I have
[48:21] a cousin that is really close to me he's
[48:22] all in Bitcoin he's now 19 uh he he he
[48:27] he's is I amazed at him how far he has
[48:31] gone down the rabbit and how deep he
[48:33] understands the whole financial system
[48:35] like he's he's really good I was not at
[48:38] this level at all in his age then
[48:40] there's of course my dad who understood
[48:42] it because uh he's a he understood gold
[48:45] before and then it's just the the
[48:46] digital aspect of it like my mom we
[48:49] talked about it my sister also has it
[48:51] but more because she trusts in my
[48:53] abilities and not because she trusts in
[48:55] Bitcoin so that's the situation but I
[48:58] think more and more get to
[49:00] it
[49:02] so you also ex Su successfully Orange
[49:05] Building your family or is it uh uh well
[49:09] I think it's like you I mean look no man
[49:11] is a profit of their own land right so
[49:13] let let's be let's be clear about that
[49:16] um your family you know your own family
[49:18] always knows your your your your
[49:21] idiosyncrasies and the weird stuff that
[49:23] you've done you know in in the and they
[49:25] can't help think of that when they're
[49:27] saying oh look there's this you know
[49:28] hard money system um so look I do have
[49:31] some members of the family who have um
[49:34] have the same same as you actually you
[49:35] know who who are really into Bitcoin and
[49:38] you know they're mining now and you know
[49:40] they do spend a lot of their time
[49:41] talking about it but we do have other
[49:43] members of the family who will
[49:45] absolutely take the mick any opportunity
[49:47] they can possibly get uh to to have a go
[49:51] um so you know it's a wide range um so
[49:55] look I think you just have to take the
[49:56] rough the smooth not not engage
[49:58] obviously not get confrontational about
[50:00] it uh just bit of a laugh with them just
[50:02] say well you know it's what I believe in
[50:04] and I do think it will affect you
[50:06] ultimately but you you know when you're
[50:08] ready have a learn and if you're not
[50:10] don't worry about it just carry on doing
[50:11] what you're doing yeah I think this is
[50:14] the general sense as a bitcoiner uh you
[50:16] should open everyone with uh like you
[50:19] should welcome everyone with open arms U
[50:22] you should never Force someone into
[50:24] learning it because cannot force it
[50:26] anyways uh it has to come with some sort
[50:28] of interests um uh to end it up to wrap
[50:31] it up where can people find you where
[50:33] can people find out more about you
[50:35] getting getting in touch with
[50:37] you uh yeah I mean nor I'm quite active
