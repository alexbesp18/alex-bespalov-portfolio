[00:00] and that's sort of what I'm saying with
[00:01] Bitcoin is like people go like oh yeah
[00:02] it's going to be like running in sand
[00:03] except I get sand slippers and you go no
[00:05] no no no no it's like you're just going
[00:07] to not be in the sand anymore Bitcoin is
[00:08] the first money you cannot steal what's
[00:11] the world look like when everybody is
[00:12] not short-term thinking scrambling to
[00:15] grab as much Fiat as they can Levering
[00:16] up going into debt trying to cut prices
[00:18] you go oh the world starts looking a lot
[00:20] better will there be taxation on a
[00:23] Bitcoin standard anybody can own
[00:25] property with egalitarian zero trust
[00:27] access nobody can prevent you from
[00:29] owning that property no one can sees
[00:30] that property from you that means that
[00:32] everybody suddenly gets elevated to the
[00:34] level of a property holder and I've
[00:35] never seen someone come into Bitcoin and
[00:36] go yeah I went full on on bitcoin and
[00:38] then like a year later I gave up CU this
[00:39] seemed stupid and I just quit like I
[00:41] want to go back to stacking eth and
[00:43] trying to gamble on Meme tokens like
[00:45] I've never seen that
[00:46] happened you're doing something that
[00:49] I've never seen before probably some
[00:51] people have done it before uh you
[00:53] writing a book in in real time like you
[00:56] writing chapter after chapter you're now
[01:00] two from four chapters uh is that
[01:02] correct uh yeah they're actually
[01:03] sections I'm kind of doing a four-part
[01:05] book um and you know I've been writing
[01:08] on medium for a long time and most of it
[01:11] was like shitcoin articles like back in
[01:13] the day and you know you can actually
[01:15] see my sort of my transfer into from a
[01:19]  coiner to a bitcoiner and it's all
[01:22] sort of live and real time in that
[01:24] history and and most of my shitcoin
[01:25] articles were kind of more oriented
[01:28] towards letting people know like hey
[01:29] this is kind of a hustle and this is how
[01:31] you game The Hustle but you know don't
[01:33] get caught up in because it's all sort
[01:35] of nonsense right but sooner or later I
[01:37] I think I actually sat down and watched
[01:39] the Sailor breed love series like I
[01:40] actually put out an article where I was
[01:42] sort of crapping on Michael sailor and
[01:44] like his ideas about perfect money and
[01:45] stuff and I it's so embarrassing to look
[01:47] back on now I mean it's still out there
[01:48] you can still go look at it and yet you
[01:51] know when I realized just how arrogant
[01:52] and sort of full of myself that I was
[01:55] that I could sit here and look at this
[01:56] guy who goes like who's clearly spent a
[01:58] lot of time and effort investigating
[02:00] this thinking about it and is devoting
[02:03] an enormous amount of capital capital to
[02:05] the Enterprise for me to sit there and
[02:07] go I know what's up you know so it was a
[02:10] little embarrassing there but to get to
[02:12] your question yes I I finally sort of
[02:15] turned into like a full-on bitcoiner um
[02:18] and with all that writing and all that
[02:21] background that I've got because I've
[02:22] got a legal research background and a
[02:23] published a bunch of legal articles and
[02:25] I've got a criminological background
[02:27] with some peer-reviewed research that's
[02:28] been published and stuff like that and I
[02:31] thought you know rather than sitting
[02:32] here just putting out these ding-dong
[02:33] articles every week like why don't I
[02:35] just sort of focus my energy and uh I
[02:38] wanted to write a book and part of my
[02:40] thing though is is you know depending on
[02:43] how many people think what I have to say
[02:44] is valuable is sort of up in the air it
[02:48] might be 10 people it might be 10,000
[02:50] might be 10 million I don't know but
[02:51] ultimately my goal is to like I want to
[02:53] push whatever I can out to the world
[02:57] because I I work from this assumption
[02:58] that there's somebody somewhere is going
[03:00] to get what I'm saying and it's going to
[03:01] click for them you know whereas someone
[03:03] like you might have said something and
[03:04] I'll say it just slightly different and
[03:06] it'll register for them but it won't
[03:08] register for the person you were talking
[03:09] to and just like when Michael sailor
[03:11] talks to people there's a lot of people
[03:12] that just inherently go oh I don't like
[03:14] what this guy's saying he's talking
[03:15] about money and riches and you know and
[03:19] and where that might be outputting for
[03:20] them and he obviously has an enormous
[03:22] reach and yet I feel like the more
[03:24] people we can get on board with this the
[03:26] more people we can bring into it the
[03:28] better off we are so with that in mind I
[03:31] was like well I'm just going to put this
[03:32] book out for free I mean I'll eventually
[03:34] I'll probably make it into a paperback I
[03:36] know there are some people just don't
[03:37] like reading off a website or whatever
[03:39] and maybe I'll charge a couple bucks for
[03:40] that or something I don't know but in
[03:41] the meantime I I wanted to take away
[03:44] that sort of that that weird incentive
[03:46] perception that says oh this guy's just
[03:49] doing this to make a buck you know it's
[03:51] like no this is important information
[03:53] people need to see it and I just want
[03:55] people to have it whether they use it or
[03:57] not whether they want to crap on it or
[03:59] not or whether they really get behind it
[04:01] it's all sort of for the net benefit the
[04:03] discussion around Bitcoin I think is
[04:05] important and then as I came to that
[04:07] conclusion I was like well why don't I
[04:09] just write it while I I mean I can just
[04:11] publish it as I go I don't have to like
[04:13] wait until it's done and keep editing
[04:15] and part of that was also in this sort
[04:18] of like Spirit of giving where you kind
[04:19] of go there's a lot of people like on
[04:21] medium or just writers in general that
[04:22] go oh you know they think about writing
[04:25] and they talk about writing but they
[04:26] rarely do the writing or they they
[04:28] rarely understand what that process
[04:29] looks like and I'm a very prolific
[04:32] writer I've probably written you know in
[04:34] my lifetime probably close to three4 of
[04:37] a million words you know I mean I've
[04:39] just typed and put out a bunch of
[04:41] content so I'm very comfortable you know
[04:43] I've done my 10,000 hours so to speak so
[04:45] I I know I'm going to finish it I know
[04:47] what it looks like to be productive I
[04:48] know what it means to like just get up
[04:50] and grind even though you don't feel
[04:51] like writing and I thought maybe
[04:53] somebody somewhere might benefit from
[04:54] that Prospect too where they could just
[04:56] sort of see like oh here's a paragraph
[04:58] that's a little clunky and then they can
[05:00] see it as it's developed later on I
[05:02] don't I don't think anyone's really
[05:03] doing that but that was sort of the
[05:05] impetus behind it so yeah it's it's a
[05:07] fun experiment so far I I love the
[05:10] process I mean it's kind of also uh my
[05:12] process with the with the podcast
[05:14] because I want to give uh every laab
[05:16] that has like a Bitcoin background a
[05:19] stage here and and just like give as
[05:22] many perspective on bitcoin as possible
[05:24] that's why I do it every day with a
[05:25] different guest I have like you a 128th
[05:28] guest in not even a half a year uh so
[05:32] it's it's it's really great to have this
[05:34] and what is the book uh about like
[05:35] what's the the the main idea uh be
[05:38] behind the book uh well the book is
[05:41] called the Great alignment um money
[05:43] power greed and Bitcoin and a lot of my
[05:47] legal research and you know one of the
[05:49] things like if you trace back into my
[05:51] history a little bit I I was pretty
[05:52] hardcore libertarian type guy like sort
[05:55] of drifting into the an cap like you
[05:57] know smash the state and we don't need
[05:58] it and just you know free trade free
[06:00] exchange and that's you know it should
[06:02] all be voluntary relationships and you
[06:05] know and then I went to law school and
[06:08] what you find especially studying
[06:10] studying like American law English law
[06:12] the common law um that that's a
[06:14] historical record and it goes back to
[06:16] you know like some of the cases you
[06:17] still read to this day in law school are
[06:19] coming from like the
[06:20] 1200s and so it when you see that
[06:23] historical narrative painted out that
[06:25] way it's very different than like
[06:26] reading a history textbook and like
[06:28] there's that saying that you know
[06:29] history is written by the winners right
[06:31] and all history has got a bias in it and
[06:33] it's especially bias towards the people
[06:35] that are actually getting to write and
[06:36] document the
[06:38] history uh the beauty of the legal
[06:40] historical record is that it it parses
[06:43] it out in a very neutral point of view
[06:46] and and it's very static and very
[06:48] thoughtful people are documenting the
[06:49] history as it's going but it's a history
[06:52] of human conflict it's a history of of
[06:54] creation of legal structures it's the
[06:55] history of creating laws and and how
[06:58] people navigate those Chang and and what
[07:00] I learned from that was that you know
[07:03] this these very simplistic Notions that
[07:05] I had from being like a Libertarian and
[07:07] going oh it should all be this and you
[07:09] know they're they're very simple ideas
[07:12] uh that are addressing an enormously
[07:14] complex topic of like how do you create
[07:16] a society and how do you create legal
[07:18] structures and where does all that come
[07:20] from and my purpose with the book is to
[07:23] sort of break that down a little bit and
[07:25] just you know start giving people a a
[07:28] slightly different Paradigm to work from
[07:31] because people say things like oh
[07:32] Bitcoin needs to replace Fiat and I go
[07:34] okay do you know what that looks like
[07:35] though and they go well of course it
[07:36] we'll just you know and they assume that
[07:39] like the world's going to look exactly
[07:40] the way it does now except it'll be fair
[07:42] I go well if you think about the
[07:44] development of everything we're doing
[07:46] right now was built on Fiat right like
[07:48] the roads that we drive on are built on
[07:50] Fiat the houses we live in the jobs we
[07:52] go to the Internet we're talking over
[07:55] the military systems the buildings the
[07:57] literally everything in the world is
[07:59] built on top of a Fiat mindset and so
[08:02] the question then becomes like what does
[08:03] it look like if you didn't build it with
[08:06] Fiat you go what is a world look like
[08:08] you go it's almost impossible to imagine
[08:11] right so I I want to start getting
[08:13] people my goal and my purpose with this
[08:15] is to go like look Bitcoin is enormous
[08:17] and it's not just because you know
[08:20] number go up or not just because you
[08:22] know a bank can put it on its balance
[08:23] sheet or someone can do black market
[08:25] transactions and buy cocaine in Bolivia
[08:27] with it it's it's bigger than that in
[08:29] that it's the first time in the history
[08:31] of humanity where you can have a
[08:35] competitive market structure that's
[08:37] predicated on a fair rule set and and I
[08:40] think when people start really
[08:42] incorporating what that means I think
[08:44] Jeff boo does a really good job of like
[08:45] sort of tracking this out and kind of
[08:47] going you you can't really understand
[08:49] what that model is because there's
[08:50] nothing to model from
[08:52] right and I I just want to start shaking
[08:55] the tree a little bit and just going hey
[08:57] like when we talk about money a lot of
[08:59] things we assume about money aren't
[09:01] exactly the way they get portrayed in
[09:02] economics textbooks or you know even
[09:04] some of the Bitcoin people and the way
[09:06] they talk about money they miss some
[09:08] kind of key components of it and the
[09:10] same thing with like power structures
[09:12] and the same thing with like where does
[09:13] greed come from and where does Authority
[09:15] come from and sovereignty and and what
[09:17] all this means I I just want to like I
[09:19] said I guess the best way to do it is or
[09:21] say it is just shake the tree a little
[09:23] bit and just go hey there's some there's
[09:24] stuff up there that you might not have
[09:26] thought about and I just want people to
[09:27] start incorporating that and thinking
[09:29] about it and that's the ultimate hope
[09:31] because uh like I said I think Bitcoin
[09:33] is such an enormous transformative
[09:36] technology that
[09:38] it's I mean it's almost wonderful to
[09:40] think about like what the world looks
[09:42] like without a Fiat standard and I also
[09:44] go it's I don't think it's going to look
[09:46] like this where we go down to the local
[09:49] clothing store and have a selection of
[09:51] 4,000 different sizes of clothes and
[09:53] 4,000 different colors and it's all
[09:54] massively wasteful and ends up in junk
[09:56] piles in in Africa because we just sort
[09:58] of dump stuff on the third world like
[10:00] that and I don't think it's going to be
[10:02] necessarily like you know everyone wants
[10:04] to run out by a new iPhone or Bugattis
[10:06] are a big deal I I think a lot of that
[10:08] stuff just slowly deteriorates and goes
[10:10] away and and we'll start finding this
[10:13] very sort of peaceful
[10:16] coexistence um with specialization and
[10:19] and very different a very different
[10:21] social structure I think is going to
[10:22] start to develop around this and that
[10:24] and I want to encourage people to start
[10:26] thinking that way because it it you know
[10:28] if you're in a Fiat mind mindset it it's
[10:30] always toxic you know and I think my
[10:35] hope is that we can start just breaking
[10:37] free of some of those shackles you
[10:39] know I love that what you said about uh
[10:43] many colors and many like different
[10:45] sizes with with the gloves um I thought
[10:48] about something uh and this actually I
[10:51] have from Seinfeld and I know that you
[10:53] worked on sanfield feel like he he made
[10:56] an episode even with that that in the
[10:59] future whenever we have like futuristic
[11:01] film and people come from the future
[11:03] like the aliens or something like that
[11:05] they always have like one suit on like
[11:06] they always have like the kind of like
[11:08] let's let's have one one one uh piece of
[11:12] glove on and I just like thought of that
[11:15] uh when you talked about that I mean
[11:18] it's it would be interesting to see if
[11:19] on the Bitcoin standard we we we get rid
[11:21] of like this this wastefulness and like
[11:24] kind of like have like more
[11:27] um how can I say it like more
[11:30] classic clothing and like more uh uh
[11:34] yeah not not as many uh different
[11:36] wasteful things to to do like it will be
[11:39] really interesting uh me gloves is like
[11:41] one small part of it like when you go
[11:43] down the road but uh I always um compare
[11:47] it with like running through sand and
[11:50] running on a solid Street and Fe is like
[11:52] running on Sand and you're like you get
[11:55] ahead you can do something you you can
[11:57] run but it's it's really hard hard and
[11:59] you you likely Fall uh and you likely
[12:02] get get on in the sand and yes you can
[12:05] also fall on solid Street you can also
[12:08] uh uh you also have to run on the solid
[12:10] street it's not like oh you have Bitcoin
[12:12] now you you can relax and not do
[12:14] anything no the the the whole uh
[12:16] opposite is the truth you have to still
[12:18] work you have to do something so it will
[12:21] be really interesting to to to see the
[12:22] future but let's first and you do it
[12:24] also with the book let's first look a
[12:26] little bit in the in the history what is
[12:28] like when you look at the history of
[12:30] money what is like the the main lesson
[12:32] you take away from that and like why is
[12:34] like Bitcoin now like the next step of
[12:37] that Evolution sure man um and before we
[12:41] get there though I'd like to say I love
[12:42] that analogy of like running through
[12:44] sand and tripping and falling and I
[12:46] would just build on that a little bit
[12:48] and sort of what I'm getting at with the
[12:49] book is like just imagine your whole
[12:51] life you've been running on Sand and
[12:52] then someone said oh here's a road and
[12:55] then what would you run like I mean you
[12:56] would just be like I'm I'm going monster
[12:59] now like I can Sprint I can do all this
[13:01] crazy stuff I can do cartwheels and and
[13:03] all of a sudden it's fundamentally
[13:05] changes like how you approach running
[13:07] right and that's sort of what I'm saying
[13:08] with Bitcoin is like people go like oh
[13:10] yeah it's going to be like running in
[13:11] sand except I get sand slippers and you
[13:13] go no no no no no it's like you're just
[13:15] going to not be in the sand anymore and
[13:17] that's a very very different sort of
[13:19] look at things um so that was great
[13:21] thank you I I I really enjoyed that
[13:24] appreciate that but um in terms of money
[13:26] I think you know people when they look
[13:29] through the history of money I I think
[13:31] probably the most common misconception
[13:33] about money and and stop me if you've
[13:34] heard this but uh there there's like a
[13:37] narrative out there right now that goes
[13:38] like and like even Lynn Alden put out a
[13:41] video recently she said you know well
[13:43] back in the day they started with barter
[13:45] and barter became too complex because
[13:47] you can't divide a spear you can't
[13:48] divide an ox card or shoes or whatever
[13:50] it it becomes imbalanced so they can't
[13:52] trade that way so then they went to
[13:54] money and that that's the sort of
[13:56] logical step that everybody takes
[13:59] and there was a great author by the name
[14:01] of David Graber who put out a book
[14:03] called The Debt the first 5,000 years
[14:05] and and that was the book that sort of
[14:06] popped my brain uh because he came out
[14:09] and it was while I was studying Finance
[14:11] while I was doing my master of laws that
[14:13] I saw this article and he said yeah
[14:15] that's a cool story like you know we
[14:17] went from Barter then it became money
[14:19] because barter was too hard and then
[14:20] from money we got credit and debt and
[14:22] that's how we get the money today and he
[14:24] said that's just false it's just not
[14:26] true but he said he could go anywhere in
[14:28] the world say that story and people go
[14:30] yeah that's right we used to barter and
[14:32] then but he said no there's they have no
[14:34] evidence of a society ever developing
[14:36] that way he said there's a lot of
[14:38] societies that developed like where they
[14:41] had a monetary system that collapsed and
[14:43] then people started bartering but he
[14:45] said going from Barter to commodity
[14:47] money to paper money then to credit and
[14:49] debt and Etc he said it's just sort of a
[14:51] what he called the founding myth of
[14:53] Economics right and if you really start
[14:56] tracing back the the history especially
[14:59] in the west like the American economic
[15:01] system which is sort of predicated on
[15:03] the British economic system and Central
[15:04] Banking and and all that kind of stuff
[15:06] it what I find is that most money
[15:11] monetary systems are there built
[15:13] specifically for taxation right like
[15:16] people go oh they need it to exchange
[15:18] value and things and I go well kind of
[15:20] but not really and if you think about
[15:22] like medieval England and if you're a
[15:24] you know some sort of medieval villager
[15:26] or something like that and a bunch of
[15:28] brutes come in and go hey we're the boss
[15:30] now because we're going to you know it's
[15:33] easier for us to beat the crap out of
[15:35] you and take whatever it is you made
[15:36] than it is for us to make stuff so after
[15:39] a while that sort of solidifies it goes
[15:41] from like that protection racket like
[15:43] hey you know there's a lot of dangerous
[15:44] guys here so you may as well give us 10%
[15:46] of your wheat your shoes your sheep
[15:49] whatever it is we'll call that your tax
[15:51] that's your protection tax and then that
[15:53] develops out a little bit uh sooner or
[15:56] later it gets to a point where that
[15:57] becomes a logistics problem right
[15:58] because you go okay now I've got a
[16:00] region of you know the size of London
[16:03] and I'm going around collecting all the
[16:04] sheep and goats and wheat and whatever
[16:06] that stuff starts to spoil after a
[16:09] while and if you're clever about it you
[16:11] go hey here's an idea how about we just
[16:13] make people pay in coins you go they got
[16:17] to pay their tax and coins to us to
[16:19] satisfy their tax and instantly you
[16:21] create an economy around species around
[16:25] coinage where you go you have to pay
[16:27] your coins in tax therefore you have to
[16:28] produce goods and sell them for this
[16:30] coin so you can get the coins so you can
[16:31] pay your tax and then if you're the
[16:34] Sovereign you can turn around and take
[16:36] those coins and go hey now I can buy the
[16:37] stuff I need when I need it from the
[16:39] people I'm forcing to pay this tax and
[16:42] so the the idea of like how currency
[16:44] developed and this notion of like it was
[16:45] a natural development from Barter to
[16:48] money to etc etc like it was a little
[16:50] flawed especially in the monetary system
[16:52] we use there's obviously been different
[16:55] types of money used throughout history
[16:57] but the one we use today is sort of
[16:59] based on this idea of like if I can
[17:02] force people to trade in a certain type
[17:05] of coin or whatever it is a shell a bead
[17:08] or whatever and then I can use that same
[17:11] money to acquire those goods that I need
[17:13] I don't have to store a bunch of stuff
[17:14] like I don't have to have grain stores
[17:16] that are going to rot after a year I
[17:18] don't have to have Leathers that are
[17:20] going to rot after a year and I can just
[17:21] pay people as I go and force them so you
[17:24] get to extract that that value from your
[17:26] population without necessarily direct
[17:29] you know stuff taxation like they would
[17:32] have done early on like if your local
[17:34] gangster just comes down and goes hey if
[17:36] you don't give me a sandwich today I'm
[17:38] gonna you know some bad guys might come
[17:40] by and wreck your store you go okay well
[17:43] sooner or later if he goes okay now I've
[17:45] got too many sandwiches because I went
[17:46] around and and held up all these
[17:48] sandwich shops and I go I can't even eat
[17:50] all these sandwiches this is a waste of
[17:52] time the smart thing for him to do is to
[17:54] charge that guy a different form of tax
[17:56] right and then make him accept it when
[17:58] you come back to get your sandwiches or
[17:59] the next store down when you want to
[18:01] come get your phone or whatever and I
[18:03] think that's a fundamental shift because
[18:04] it it changes the notion from like money
[18:07] naturally evolved from trade to money
[18:09] was fundamentally from the start a thing
[18:12] to steal from you it just made it easier
[18:14] for people to facilitate the theft for
[18:16] these strong men to facilitate the theft
[18:18] and and that would be the thing I would
[18:19] say is probably one of the more
[18:21] fundamental it's slight but it's
[18:24] profound in its implications you know I
[18:27] never heard that before
[18:29] that perspective on money I love it so
[18:33] much and and then you can come also do
[18:36] the do the point where Bitcoin is the
[18:38] first money you cannot steal correct I
[18:41] mean uh you you probably could steal
[18:45] most of the Bitcoin because most of the
[18:47] people don't have a good enough
[18:50] setup right but but uh if if you're
[18:54] really good in your setup or if if you
[18:57] like destroy your setup and then just
[18:58] have a brain wallet which I don't
[19:00] recommend because it's way too risky to
[19:02] like hit your head and then forget it
[19:04] but it's in the in theory possible to
[19:07] just like have it in your head they
[19:09] cannot take it away from you they can
[19:11] force you to tell you but you have the
[19:13] choice to yeah do a die with my Bitcoin
[19:17] or give a give a a bit my Bitcoin out
[19:20] because if they uh murder you they still
[19:24] don't have the Bitcoin if anything else
[19:26] if you have a house if you have gold if
[19:27] you have anything else they can just hit
[19:30] you in the head or like shoot you and
[19:32] then they have the stuff they don't need
[19:34] your permission they they don't need
[19:35] your knowledge and that's a fundamental
[19:38] change um which also brings me to the
[19:41] question like the next question you also
[19:42] mentioned it now with taxation is will
[19:45] there be taxation on on a Bitcoin
[19:48] standard uh is is or is it will be more
[19:50] like a fee based system where we like
[19:53] pay for services uh pay for production
[19:56] pay for whatever is pay for good streets
[20:00] uh and and it's more optional and and
[20:03] less uh forced on Everybody by
[20:06] birth um that that's a great question
[20:09] and to be perfectly honest I I can't
[20:11] really say how that sort of develops
[20:13] right what I can say is there's an
[20:15] enormous amount of momentum and energy
[20:18] contained in the system that we have
[20:19] right and there was a great post I can't
[20:22] remember who posted if I had Twitter up
[20:24] I could find it um that I reposted and
[20:26] it was a quote from howy and he said
[20:28] look man I think think you know the
[20:29] transactional value of Bitcoin I think
[20:30] is pretty low I think ultimately
[20:32] transactions are going to be between big
[20:33] Banks and there's going to be a second
[20:34] layer whether it's Banks or layer twos
[20:36] or whatever they're going to handle the
[20:38] transaction component of it and I agree
[20:40] with halin 100% you know and I think
[20:43] there's a lot of the transactional like
[20:45] the black market money guys like we need
[20:47] uncensorable transactions and and they
[20:49] put a real high premium on that kind of
[20:51] thing and you know and that sort of
[20:53] drifts into the big blocker camp and all
[20:54] that kind of stuff and I I I take a very
[20:56] different View and I I sort of look at
[20:58] it like
[20:59] be because I understand like what
[21:01] sovereignty means and where the like
[21:03] property rights and people talk about
[21:04] property rights and things like that and
[21:06] I go ultimately no one has any property
[21:08] rights on planet Earth because the
[21:10] Sovereign is the ultimate domain has
[21:13] eminent power over all those domains so
[21:15] you go this is my land they go well how
[21:17] come you paying tax on it and here in
[21:19] the United States we have a process
[21:20] called emminent domain the the state the
[21:23] US government can come in and go we need
[21:25] this land more than you do we're going
[21:26] to take it and they're required a lot
[21:28] ofay pay you a fair value for it or
[21:29] whatever but they'll take it they'll
[21:30] bulldoze your property and build a
[21:33] freeway on it if they think that's what
[21:34] they need to do one of the more alarming
[21:37] things that occurred in the United
[21:38] States is there was a private developer
[21:39] that wanted to develop some beachfront
[21:41] property and then they got the
[21:42] government to use eminent domain to take
[21:44] that property from private owner so they
[21:46] could give it to a private developer and
[21:47] you go that's not right but they let
[21:49] that
[21:50] fly so you go well if property if your
[21:54] only right to property is guaranteed by
[21:56] a piece of paper from The Sovereign from
[21:58] the from the state you go then you don't
[22:00] really have any property rights the
[22:02] fundamental shift in Bitcoin is you go
[22:05] well your property rights are guaranteed
[22:07] by 625 ex aash and you know 27,000
[22:12] terawatts or however many terawatts of
[22:13] power that they're pumping out you go
[22:15] who who is in control of that
[22:19] Authority node Runners I don't know I
[22:21] mean nobody right and so that if if you
[22:25] start thinking about just the way our
[22:26] system is set up you go our system is PR
[22:28] predicated on those who have property
[22:31] are the powerful ones the more property
[22:34] you have like tangible land or whatever
[22:36] it was and it started off as land in the
[22:39] medieval times and it's now gradually
[22:41] coess into like how many buildings do
[22:42] you have and and stuff like that but
[22:45] that that is the source of power right
[22:47] property rights property ownership um
[22:50] but they're all they can all be seized
[22:52] from you on some level and if you create
[22:55] a system like we already have with
[22:57] Bitcoin where you can go anybody can own
[23:00] property with a egalitarian zero trust
[23:03] access nobody can prevent you from
[23:04] owning that property no one can seize
[23:06] that property from you that means that
[23:08] everybody suddenly gets elevated to the
[23:10] level of a property holder and a rights
[23:13] holder and they have a say in how
[23:16] property gets distributed and so when
[23:18] you try and exert your authority over
[23:19] somebody you go I'm going to seize your
[23:21] land you go well good luck with that
[23:23] buddy because it's not my land it's kind
[23:24] of been your land the whole time all
[23:26] pack up and leave obviously you don't
[23:27] want people get disrupted like that and
[23:29] I and I do believe that we should have
[23:32] you know Sovereign rights of like
[23:33] Defending Your Right to be on that piece
[23:35] of property that you've developed and
[23:37] bought or whatever it is but it it
[23:39] fundamentally changes that calculus
[23:41] because if you go hey I'm in Ethiopia
[23:43] and I own property in Bitcoin City and
[23:46] I'm in the Sudan and I have property in
[23:49] Bitcoin City and I live in Peru and I
[23:51] have property in Bitcoin City and I live
[23:53] in United Kingdom and I have property in
[23:54] Bitcoin City like everybody can own a
[23:57] piece of this
[23:59] this tangible property and if that's the
[24:01] only source of power then all power gets
[24:03] distributed globally maybe not perfectly
[24:07] but you can't take someone's power from
[24:10] them at that point and and I think
[24:11] that's the the sort of huge implication
[24:14] of this I may have drifted off what your
[24:16] question was at this point I I tend to
[24:17] babble a little bit but uh um but that
[24:22] that is sort of where I'm kind of
[24:23] landing on all of this and and why I
[24:25] think you know like Bitcoin is is such a
[24:27] huge deal so it's it's amazing there are
[24:30] so many great things there were in there
[24:33] the first thing that I want to add is um
[24:36] you touched on like there will be like
[24:39] banks that transact on on bitcoin and on
[24:41] baseland then there will be lay off up I
[24:43] 100% agree I even made like a podcast
[24:45] episode with vicet uh the the guy from
[24:48] from Twitter that made about UT Soul
[24:50] management a lot of stuff and he is like
[24:54] we we all know there's like a limited
[24:56] amount of Institutions and people that
[24:58] will be able to long-term transact on
[25:01] the base layer because other people will
[25:03] be priced out and that's a good thing to
[25:06] have a secure really robust base layer
[25:09] and then layer up and scale over layer
[25:12] tech technology like just like the dcpb
[25:14] protocol uh in in a in a comparison uh
[25:18] there will be uh as he said around 10
[25:21] million institutions or people that
[25:23] could theoretically trade uh per month
[25:27] maybe the numbers 5 million maybe the
[25:29] number is 50 million it's it's hard to
[25:32] to guess uh but around that number and
[25:34] all all others will be on top of that
[25:37] will be a really interesting thing and
[25:39] uh there there will be this this thing
[25:41] where there will be big Banks trading on
[25:43] it and some Wales who got in in 2013
[25:47] which which will be really really fun to
[25:49] see but I just wanted to to to to to add
[25:52] that um in in the conversation um in in
[25:58] that sense and you also touched that on
[25:59] that in in the in the book I think um
[26:02] how will then Bitcoin fix the the the
[26:05] financial corruption which is a a
[26:08] fascinating topic for me and it's still
[26:11] like for me when it's just money
[26:13] corruption will still happen in some
[26:16] some sense but uh C how can it be like
[26:20] better on a Bitcoin
[26:22] standard well I again it's another great
[26:25] question and I I think um the way way
[26:29] this ultimately leads and it's the title
[26:32] of the book The Great realignment I I
[26:33] think what it does is it realigns
[26:35] incentives and gradually right and the
[26:39] the clearest analogy model I have is you
[26:41] go just talk to anybody that's gone on a
[26:43] Bitcoin standard right where they go I'm
[26:45] all in on bitcoin that's all I care
[26:46] about is Bitcoin I'm just saving Bitcoin
[26:48] and then talk to them like a month later
[26:50] and go how's your life and they go I
[26:51] don't know it's just better you know
[26:53] like everything's just a little bit
[26:54] better I'm more focused on health I'm
[26:56] doing this I'm doing like everything all
[26:58] of a sudden it's just magically lifted
[27:00] right nothing at all changed in their
[27:03] circumstance except for that one shift I
[27:05] went from Fiat slave to save in here and
[27:07] hoping I get my 401k built up and trying
[27:10] to squirrel and just Rat Race kind of
[27:11] thinking to like oh I'm I'm just on this
[27:14] Bitcoin standard now the the beauty of
[27:16] that though is it it encourages Saving
[27:18] right and if you just strip it all way
[27:21] strip all the artifice strip everything
[27:22] else you go what are you doing right now
[27:23] I'm I'm saving for later and that's the
[27:27] delay of gratification right and I go if
[27:30] that has that impact on you that has the
[27:32] impact on literally everyone I've ever
[27:35] seen that gets into Bitcoin I've never
[27:36] seen someone come to bitcoin and go yeah
[27:38] I went full on on bitcoin and then like
[27:39] a year later I gave up because this
[27:40] seemed stupid and I just quit like I
[27:42] want to go back to you know stacking eth
[27:44] and trying to gamble on Meme tokens like
[27:46] I've never seen that happen I see a lot
[27:49] of people kind of get in dip their toe
[27:50] bounce back and forth and then they
[27:52] finally get that fullon orange pill and
[27:54] then next thing you know they're just
[27:55] like full steam
[27:56] ahead and their life improves
[27:59] dramatically because it shifts all of
[28:00] their incentives it shifts all their
[28:02] incentives to that that that long-term
[28:05] thinking right that that that idea of
[28:08] like I need to save up and I need to
[28:10] orient my resources into more important
[28:12] things if you would have met me 15 20
[28:14] years ago I used to think the greatest
[28:16] thing in the world would be to get an
[28:17] American Express black card and buy a
[28:19] new BMW every year on lease I go that's
[28:22] I've made it you know by like just
[28:25] getting in in insane amounts of debt
[28:27] like at one point I think I was carrying
[28:28] like $300 or $400,000 wor a credit card
[28:30] debt it was insane just I mean absolute
[28:32] Madness and I felt very successful at
[28:34] that point and I look back on it I go
[28:37] God what a toxic just ugly human being I
[28:39] was living in that mindset today like I
[28:42] drive like this little dinky like I have
[28:44] a 2007 Toyota Prius that I just love
[28:46] keeping going and it just gets me around
[28:49] I could give a rat's ass about what
[28:51] people think about it there's I I have
[28:53] all that sort of idea around like social
[28:56] flexing from consump
[28:58] is just gone and yet that allows me to
[29:01] put a lot more effort and time and
[29:02] energy into doing things like hey I can
[29:04] come out here and spread the Bitcoin
[29:05] love and I can devote my time and energy
[29:08] to stacking SATs and I I I don't
[29:10] prioritize things that are wasteful
[29:12] which then has all of a sudden allowed
[29:13] me to prioritize things like improving
[29:15] my diet and exercising more and giving
[29:18] time to myself and but that's all that
[29:20] incentive realignment and I say if it's
[29:23] true for me it's true for you there are
[29:25] human beings that run these big
[29:26] institutions like whether it's Chase
[29:28] Bank or you know Target or clothing
[29:31] company here or uh you know you name it
[29:35] they're they're all people and and
[29:37] people I think like to look at them and
[29:39] go oh they're evil they're doing evil
[29:41] things and I go well there I it's a
[29:44] thing called handland Razer I'm pretty
[29:45] sure it's handland Razer that says you
[29:47] know given the choice between assuming
[29:49] bad intentions or just assuming
[29:51] incompetence you kind of always
[29:52] gravitate towards incompetence right and
[29:55] for most of these people I go I think
[29:57] most people are generally operating from
[29:59] Good Intentions and sometimes they're
[30:01] making really difficult decisions but
[30:02] Fiat forces difficult decisions like
[30:04] it's continually crushing your ability
[30:07] to make good decisions and the second
[30:09] you get off that standard you get on the
[30:10] Bitcoin standard it suddenly makes these
[30:13] decisions like you go okay here's the
[30:15] positive path and here's all the shitty
[30:16] stuff and so you can just always choose
[30:18] the positive path and if that happens on
[30:20] the individual level when it happens on
[30:22] the institutional level when it happens
[30:23] in the small business level all of a
[30:25] sudden everybody is sort of going
[30:26] towards a positive path we need to delay
[30:28] gratification we need to save for the
[30:29] future and we need to build things and
[30:32] structures around that that facilitate
[30:34] that and you go oh what's the world look
[30:35] like when everybody is not short-term
[30:38] thinking scrambling to grab as much Fiat
[30:40] as they can Levering up going into debt
[30:42] trying to cut prices you go oh the world
[30:44] starts looking a lot better like just
[30:47] and that's how I think it fixes that
[30:49] Financial incentive because pretty soon
[30:51] even right now you go like should I go
[30:53] and lever up and try and do all these
[30:55] crazy loans or should I just put Bitcoin
[30:57] in the balance sheet like Michael
[30:58] sailor's just sort of going look this is
[31:00] super easy like I just buy Bitcoin and
[31:03] now I'm successful and if all of a
[31:06] sudden everybody's doing that you go
[31:07] well what what happens to like
[31:09] shrinkflation and what happens to the
[31:11] need to decline quality and what all
[31:13] this stuff just starts slowly
[31:15] evaporating it's and I think there'll be
[31:17] a time when we kind of look around and
[31:18] go oh everything's just better like no
[31:22] Glorious Revolution no collapse and
[31:25] zombies and fighting in the streets you
[31:27] just kind of things just get a little
[31:28] bit better every day until everyone's
[31:31] just kind of doing good and that's
[31:33] that's how I think it fixes the
[31:34] financial system is uh sort of a very
[31:37] optimistic but I think very practical
[31:39] view on on how this can unfold you know
[31:42] if you are listening to this podcast you
[31:44] might be wondering what is actually the
[31:46] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[31:48] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[31:51] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[31:52] right source and you have to store
[31:54] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[31:56] first thing how how to buy Bitcoin it's
[31:59] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[32:01] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[32:03] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[32:05] own token or something like that be on a
[32:07] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[32:10] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[32:13] for that and now where do you store
[32:16] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[32:18] hardware wallet on a self custody
[32:21] solution where you yourself hold your
[32:24] keys and it should be a Cod wallet so
[32:27] that's My Simple Solutions that's a
[32:29] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[32:32] there back up your seat fras and you are
[32:35] better than 95% of all Bitcoin holders
[32:38] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[32:41] it's an absolutely must have one last
[32:44] thing before we get back to the video
[32:46] I'm really passionate about meeting
[32:47] other bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[32:50] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[32:53] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[32:56] and biggest Bitcoin coin only conference
[32:59] in whole of Europe for all Americans
[33:01] please visit Europe and visit this place
[33:04] in June for all europes it's a must go
[33:07] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[33:09] PR conference you basically have to come
[33:11] I will do interviews there and I would
[33:13] love to meet you all there use code
[33:16] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[33:19] discounts and use the links down in the
[33:21] description it it sounds so simple but
[33:23] it's so profound and it's really hard to
[33:26] to get it across to to people that are
[33:27] not that as deep in Bitcoin because when
[33:30] I talk to them uh that incentives are
[33:32] everything and we have a lot of amazing
[33:34] quotes uh that showed that I think I
[33:37] mean he was not really Pro Bitcoin but
[33:40] he still achieved a lot of things and he
[33:42] said um I forgot his name not Charlie
[33:46] manga the other one oh buff oh no it was
[33:49] Charlie manga sorry not Buffett it was
[33:52] Charlie manga and he said uh show me uh
[33:55] your five biggest incentives and I will
[33:57] show you what will do uh this is this is
[34:01] basically it like and Bitcoin changes
[34:03] incentives uh in thinking long term
[34:05] versus just thinking thinking shortterm
[34:08] because I see it I was I was in
[34:10] companies I was uh in I also was before
[34:13] Bitcoin I was a lot of in conference
[34:15] calls like I did this this even weekly
[34:18] trading I mean I had a lot of luck in my
[34:21] timing and I made a lot of money with it
[34:23] but uh it it was like I was on
[34:25] conference call and I was like oh
[34:27] this this happened on a conference call
[34:29] and I set then money on that and next
[34:31] week I made either 5,000 Plus or lost
[34:34] 5,000 which is what what did I do with
[34:36] my M with with my time this is not
[34:38] productive I I did not spend time with
[34:40] my family I did not bring any value to
[34:43] society I just gambled uh and had luck
[34:47] like that that's basically it uh and
[34:49] then and they have to say like uh what
[34:52] what what is the better world when
[34:53] everybody is on a solid Street can run
[34:56] or not run whatever what he want to do
[34:58] and provide value uh or is it better to
[35:01] some some rent Seekers sitting on the
[35:04] top of the sand with like those those
[35:06] things where the Lifeguard sitting in
[35:08] there and just seeing everybody uh
[35:10] fooling around in in the sand and other
[35:13] Us in the in the sand and like tripping
[35:16] over each other and not really coming
[35:18] along it's it's it's it's such a
[35:20] different world and it's it's hard to
[35:21] explain why it's so much better and I'm
[35:23] also like in in the process of writing
[35:27] my for around that because this is the
[35:29] question I always try to to answer like
[35:32] how does this Bitcoin standard look like
[35:35] individual level on like it's it's it's
[35:37] it's really hard to wrap my hand around
[35:39] that's why I'm always asking every every
[35:41] guest because more people are yeah
[35:45] that's awesome man yeah the the one
[35:49] question that I I I I have in the in
[35:52] mind a lot of people say like oh gold is
[35:54] also greater like H have gold and
[35:57] Bitcoin Co and I have gold but it's not
[36:00] it's just an emotional value for me not
[36:02] not something that I I I would do for
[36:04] financial reasons um do you think that
[36:07] Bitcoin is just the next evolution of
[36:09] money and then just completely
[36:12] demonetizes uh gold which will would
[36:15] mean that gold crashes down to the
[36:17] utility value of like what is it 5% 10%
[36:21] jewelry Electronics jewelry and the
[36:24] smartphone news and stuff like that um
[36:27] you know gold is a funny one because I
[36:28] used to be a big gold bug in fact one of
[36:30] the things I would always you know when
[36:31] I was kind of crapping on bitcoin is I'd
[36:33] be like oh gold is real money and you
[36:35] know um and yet that soon it it became
[36:40] very sort of obvious that that's not a
[36:42] great you know store value or anything
[36:44] like that uh it's roughly the simple
[36:47] fact that people have just appreciated
[36:48] it for a long time and you own gold so
[36:50] you know what it's like like when you
[36:51] actually hold a gold coin there's
[36:52] something kind of special about it right
[36:54] and one of the arguments I used to make
[36:55] is like I'll tell you what go find a
[36:57] 10-year-old kid and say hey go wash my
[36:59] car I can either give you this gold coin
[37:02] or I'm going to solve this complex math
[37:03] problem for you and they'll go I'll take
[37:05] the gold coin like 100% of the time you
[37:07] don't even have to think about it right
[37:09] um so it's hard for people that are used
[37:12] to tangible things like that to wrap
[37:14] their head around what it means to have
[37:15] like this network that's egalitarian AIS
[37:18] egalitarian zero trust only I can have
[37:20] it as unseizable asset that that's a
[37:22] very abstract sort of thing that you got
[37:24] to deal with gold coin is just you know
[37:26] it's good it's gold coin um and
[37:30] ultimately if you trace it back like
[37:31] there's I would argue right now there's
[37:33] a reason central banks are stacking up
[37:35] all their gold and they always do this
[37:38] um when their currencies are about to
[37:40] collapse right like that that is the a
[37:42] really really good sign that things are
[37:44] about to go sideways and they use gold
[37:47] because people recognize it as having
[37:50] value like intrinsic value and that is
[37:52] obviously a a loaded term uh if you talk
[37:55] to a true Austrian Economist I go there
[37:57] is no such thing as an intrinsic value
[37:59] and it's funny watching Peter Schiff get
[38:00] himself wrapped around the axle on this
[38:02] because he goes well gold has an
[38:03] intrinsic value I'm like you're supposed
[38:04] to be the Austrian guy dude like you're
[38:05] supposed to know better than that's not
[38:07] that's not an Austrian economic
[38:08] principle but he'll preach those the
[38:10] ones that he likes that fits his
[38:12] Paradigm he promotes but you know when
[38:14] it comes to that one little sticking
[38:15] point he suddenly is just gold gold gold
[38:19] right um so central banks stack gold
[38:22] because it has that incentive they
[38:24] understand gold very well but they use
[38:26] that to bootstrap their thing they go
[38:28] hey what what gives your currency value
[38:30] why should we trust your currency over
[38:32] you know like me going hey it's Daniel
[38:34] white bucks and we're going to use
[38:35] Daniel white bucks they go well ours is
[38:37] back by gold what's his back by goes
[38:38] well he he seems like a nice enough guy
[38:40] I guess I don't know but no one's gonna
[38:42] forget to take Daniel white bucks just
[38:43] like no one wants to take Venezuela
[38:44] bucks because it's not backed by
[38:46] anything but if you go well we have
[38:48] 216,000 metric tons of gold in our
[38:51] vaults and that's what is backing our
[38:53] what I think is going to be the next
[38:54] thing is going to be the cbdc
[38:57] um that's how you bootstrap the new
[38:59] currency and if you think about the
[39:00] current US dollar system you go where
[39:03] did that come from well because of World
[39:05] War II and because of all the
[39:06] shenanigans going on in the world at
[39:07] that point it was about 80% of the
[39:09] world's gold reserves were in the United
[39:11] States at the conclusion of World War
[39:13] Two and something like 80% of the
[39:15] world's productive capacity so you go
[39:17] okay well if we're going to bootstrap a
[39:19] new currency to sort of Kickstart
[39:20] everything and get everything rolling
[39:22] again because you know Europe was broke
[39:24] there you know it was bombed into dust
[39:26] basically
[39:28] and you go well who's left standing well
[39:31] it's the us nobody wanted to do this but
[39:33] they used gold to bootstrap that they go
[39:35] okay well this is what we're going to do
[39:36] it's going to be this little exchange
[39:37] thing where you can trade 20 bucks for
[39:39] you know or $35 for an ounce of gold or
[39:41] whatever it was uh and that thing I mean
[39:44] it fell apart within about three years
[39:46] after they they did it like the balance
[39:48] of accounts was already upside down you
[39:50] know by 48 49 by the 60s it was just
[39:53] wrecked you know because there there's
[39:55] that incentive to just go well we can
[39:56] just put a little more we'll figure out
[39:57] how to pay it back later and then next
[39:59] thing you know it's you go oh well we
[40:00] don't have enough to pay it back and so
[40:02] the whole thing falls apart but the the
[40:05] point is is that they use gold to to
[40:07] bootstrap the next scheme so they can
[40:09] give it some legitimacy before they go
[40:11] and start blowing it up and doing what
[40:13] they always do with it which is inflate
[40:14] it and screw it up and and try and skim
[40:17] their take while they're screwing
[40:19] everybody else at the same time um and I
[40:22] I think
[40:23] Bitcoin you know as as the central banks
[40:26] try and do this which is ultimately fine
[40:28] they go okay we're going to create this
[40:29] thing and you go all right great you're
[40:31] going to create some new inflationary
[40:32] digital whatever thing if you're
[40:35] economic energy your savings your effort
[40:37] your productivity is saved in Bitcoin
[40:39] you go well it's it's immune to that so
[40:41] go ahead bootstrap your new you know the
[40:44] the Euro brick dollar or the you know
[40:47] the Fuji Japan China dollar whatever you
[40:50] guys come up with I don't know price in
[40:52] Bitcoin those are all going to zero
[40:54] eventually I mean it might take 10 years
[40:56] 15 20 years so go I'll just keep saving
[40:58] over here I'll use your thing to
[40:59] transact in and to get my Social credits
[41:01] or whatever it is I need to do to go get
[41:03] my bread and my milk um but sooner or
[41:06] later that sort of demonetizes that
[41:08] whole thing and if if we can avoid that
[41:11] sort of Calamity where the currencies
[41:12] collapse and everything and they have to
[41:14] reboot and reset if we can kind of keep
[41:15] the system going and and they've done a
[41:17] pretty remarkable job of kicking that
[41:19] can you know and just inflating their
[41:21] way through stuff and I I don't know how
[41:22] they bandaged this whole thing together
[41:24] and it's it's kind of a miracle that
[41:25] these Central Bankers keep this whole
[41:27] scheme running but somehow they keep
[41:28] pulling it off and I think if we can
[41:31] just kind of keep that going sooner or
[41:32] later it it reorients their incentive
[41:35] structure as well eventually it's going
[41:37] to become very obvious they go oh well
[41:39] instead of holding toxic asset back
[41:41] Securities that have no backing on our
[41:44] balance sheet maybe we should just lump
[41:45] a little into the Bitcoin and then you
[41:47] know as we're inflating and doing all
[41:49] our QE and all this just Shenanigans
[41:52] trying to prop the whole thing up their
[41:54] little Bitcoin balance sheet can keep
[41:55] going up and then suddenly they go oh
[41:57] we're well we're actually not too bad
[41:58] right now like it's kind of our balance
[42:01] of accounts is even and then starts
[42:02] Shifting the other way and they go well
[42:04] we don't have to print as much and if
[42:05] the US government is doing the same
[42:06] thing they go oh we don't have to print
[42:08] as much and suddenly this all sort of
[42:10] just curves out and just levels out and
[42:12] it's like it's like a a plane that's
[42:14] sort of spiraling out of control and
[42:16] then the guy finally just wres the ship
[42:17] and you get on level flight and you go
[42:19] oh well can we climb now and you go yeah
[42:22] we're back under control let's just
[42:24] let's see how high this plane can fly
[42:25] and uh and so I I think I don't know if
[42:29] it'll be some catastrophic shift between
[42:30] gold to bitcoin and you know gold just
[42:33] suddenly gets demonetized and goes down
[42:34] to the to to the value I think what'll
[42:37] happen is it just gradually you know God
[42:40] willing kind of thing you go I I think
[42:42] if we can sort of keep this little Ponzi
[42:43] scheme go on for a little bit longer
[42:46] sooner or later those incentives are
[42:47] just naturally realigned so gold just
[42:49] stops making sense you go well it's
[42:51] pretty I like holding the coins and you
[42:53] know but then you might have people that
[42:54] are like oh I'm just going to build a
[42:55] gold statue why cuz it's you know it's
[42:58] 2,000 SATs who cares you know I'll just
[43:01] I'll just have you know 30 or 40 kilos
[43:02] of gold statue just because I like the
[43:04] way it looks but I I think its monetary
[43:07] premium it's monetary value I think will
[43:08] just decline because it it just doesn't
[43:10] make
[43:11] sense and a lot of interesting things in
[43:13] there like uh I feel I feel like the the
[43:16] kids uh the example that you brought up
[43:19] um kids have an fundamental
[43:21] understanding now that digital things
[43:23] actually have value because they buy all
[43:25] those skins they buy all those things in
[43:27] the video games which uh like the old
[43:30] older generation in the childhood just
[43:32] did not had so thing like uh kids from
[43:35] like 50 years ago they probably would
[43:37] all go with with with the the shiny gold
[43:40] thing because they like what is this
[43:42] digital thing we don't even know about
[43:43] it but right now like they pay so many
[43:45] things in in in the digital
[43:47] raids I feel like most of them uh would
[43:51] even choose the the Bitcoin thing
[43:53] because it's digital and they they can
[43:56] they rather have something digital they
[43:58] have on the computer they can have on
[43:59] their phone rather on this like physical
[44:03] thing like they don't even know what to
[44:04] do with the
[44:05] prick but I don't know it would be
[44:08] interesting would be an interesting
[44:09] study like get 100 kids in a room uh and
[44:12] give them the the the choice between a
[44:14] digital Bitcoin or a small gold coin uh
[44:18] would be interesting to see the results
[44:20] I I don't know the the results but well
[44:23] I think I've seen there's like sorry for
[44:25] interrupting s but I've seen there's
[44:27] videos out there where they go like hey
[44:29] do you want a gold coin or a chocolate
[44:30] bar and people like I'll take the
[44:31] chocolate bar you know so it it's it's
[44:34] really hard to say how it kind of ends
[44:36] up I mean people's you know like would
[44:39] you like a Bitcoin or a chocolate bar
[44:40] people go take the chocolate bar so you
[44:42] know it's it it would be super
[44:44] interesting to see what they picked like
[44:46] physical gold versus a Bitcoin but yeah
[44:48] yeah I I a kid usually lives really in
[44:51] the moment uh and in the moment the
[44:55] chocolate bar is just so much better
[44:56] than gold
[44:59] coin I can understand that um uh let's
[45:03] come back to the to the topic that we
[45:05] just discussed with with the cbdc with
[45:08] gold with with the with also the kind of
[45:11] the change in the power structure uh
[45:14] which I also heard a little bit out
[45:15] there um and all all the things that we
[45:18] basically discussed the last 40 minutes
[45:20] um how do you think is is is cbdc the
[45:23] last straw of of the Fiat system the
[45:26] last uh hope they they can get with more
[45:30] monitoring with more
[45:32] control uh like get get the plane under
[45:36] control uh and and have a little longer
[45:39] the the complete control of the
[45:40] financial monetary policy uh and and how
[45:43] will then Bitcoin like change this whole
[45:45] whole power
[45:46] structure uh cbdc may be I I mean when I
[45:50] was um I I
[45:54] frequently well let me prace this by
[45:56] saying like I go and look at source
[45:59] documents right like when I was I was
[46:01] teaching at a at a four-year college and
[46:03] it was in California right around the
[46:05] time the Supreme Court there struck down
[46:07] a gay marriage law like they upheld a
[46:09] gay marriage ban or something like that
[46:11] all my students came in and said hey are
[46:12] you going to go protest the Supreme
[46:13] Court's decision and I said no what oh
[46:16] my God you don't support gay marriage
[46:18] and I go no no it's nothing like that
[46:19] did you read the court decision they go
[46:21] well no of course not but they they're
[46:23] against gays and this and that I go
[46:25] maybe you should read what they said
[46:27] versus like getting all up in arms about
[46:29] what you think because if you actually
[46:31] go read the decision they go we support
[46:33] your right to get married we are hands
[46:35] are tied though because if we vote this
[46:37] way on this that means we have to undo
[46:39] 40 Years of other laws we can't do that
[46:41] so sorry get your legislators to make a
[46:44] to pass a bill something like that but
[46:45] we can't do it because we're going to
[46:46] blow up the system by voting the way
[46:49] that we really want to and we just can't
[46:51] and I go that's a very different story
[46:53] than the Supreme Court is anti-gay right
[46:55] Supreme Court is anti-gay the California
[46:57] Supreme Court is anti-gay rights is much
[47:00] easier to sell to an audience and
[47:02] Supreme Court makes difficult decision
[47:03] on gay rights bill because of past
[47:05] historical precedent and 40 Years of
[47:07] legislative changes and the Constitution
[47:09] has been modified so many times that
[47:10] this is the only result they could come
[47:12] up with you go who's going to read that
[47:13] article people they're lost after the
[47:15] third word you know um so when it comes
[47:18] to the cbdc thing like if you and and
[47:21] it's very natural and I totally
[47:23] understand why people get there because
[47:24] they go like oh my God this is like
[47:25] surveillance state from China they're
[47:27] going to come in Social credit score and
[47:28] it's like an episode of Black Mirror
[47:30] where you go and you go oh I didn't
[47:31] smile enough and now my credit's gone
[47:33] and I can't buy coffee anymore and I'm
[47:35] poor and and it's a natural impulse and
[47:38] and it could very easily lead to that
[47:40] kind of thing and yet we also still have
[47:43] structures in place but if you go read
[47:44] the actual banking documents because
[47:45] they've been piloting cbdcs all over the
[47:47] place and they tend to be very
[47:49] thoughtful people about what they're
[47:51] doing they're very very sober people I I
[47:53] met someone that worked at the at the
[47:54] Federal Reserve and I go uh you're
[47:57] Federal Reserve Nazi what you see them
[47:59] and they're just like hey how you doing
[48:01] they got a polo shirt on and they're
[48:02] they're at the barbecue and you're just
[48:03] like you're you're the source of all
[48:06] evil in in the planet they go no they're
[48:08] just this very sober just kind of like
[48:10] well we're trying to do you know well I
[48:12] mean it's more complicated than that and
[48:13] that that's sort of where I get to it
[48:15] but if you look at the things that they
[48:17] find from these Pilots they go well hey
[48:19] some people expressed a lot of concern
[48:21] about financial privacy and not just for
[48:23] like hey I want to go buy drugs with
[48:25] this it's like hey I'm buying gift from
[48:27] my husband and I don't want him to know
[48:29] and if it's just a transaction that's
[48:31] out there then that's no good we need
[48:33] some privacy and they go what if we made
[48:34] it so like the first thousand doll are
[48:36] just private transactions after that it
[48:38] gets recorded and then they have these
[48:40] other things put in place and they go
[48:42] well what if someone can't do this or
[48:43] what if someone can't do this or what if
[48:45] someone needs to do this and they start
[48:46] trying to find little ways to integrate
[48:48] that ultimately if you look at it you go
[48:50] well we're on a cbdc already like just
[48:53] ask a Canadian trucker how much access
[48:55] they had to their money during that
[48:57] protest you go none it all just cut it
[48:59] off because it's all digital it's all
[49:01] recorded it's all on their Ledger
[49:03] already 80% of our transactions are
[49:06] based by card you go to Europe it's like
[49:07] 90 95% so you go well what's the
[49:10] difference the 5% of people that are
[49:12] still going I only pay with $20 bills or
[49:14] $20 deut marks or $20 Euros or $20 pound
[49:17] notes you go or 20 pound notes
[49:20] whatever you uh you kind of realize like
[49:24] that that dystopian nightmare already
[49:27] descended upon us uh with all these AML
[49:29] laws like they've already they've
[49:31] already implemented all those controls
[49:33] already and they've already got that
[49:35] infrastructure put into place so the
[49:37] next step is just like an efficiency for
[49:39] them it's not necessarily like this is
[49:41] going to Grant all these extraordinary
[49:43] new powers they just go we've already
[49:45] got those Powers we're just trying to
[49:46] make it more efficient for this to get
[49:48] distributed it net benefits them a ton
[49:51] because their Senor goes to zero right
[49:53] like they just make money off every
[49:55] little unit they create
[49:57] whereas right now they actually have to
[49:58] print some paper or mint a little you
[50:00] know alled coin or something like that
[50:02] so in terms of the way Bitcoin sort of
[50:05] ties into that you go well if it if it's
[50:07] your reserve asset then it kind of
[50:09] doesn't matter what the unit of account
[50:11] for the rest of you know like if I go to
[50:13] Starbucks right now I don't want to sit
[50:14] there and try and figure out how to get
[50:16] you know some way to transact that by
[50:19] trading a cork or a you know a wood coin
[50:21] or something like that it's it's pretty
[50:22] nice just be able to tap the little
[50:24] thing and go okay thanks for the coffee
[50:25] and walk off
[50:27] um but if that becomes a lightning thing
[50:28] and you can tap and do that that's great
[50:30] for me in the United States like every
[50:31] time I tap a lightning thing it's why I
[50:33] don't use it because it's a taxable
[50:35] event for me because you know most my
[50:37] average buy was like 26 Grand or
[50:39] something like that and I was buying
[50:40] right at the bottom there at 168 and I
[50:42] go well if I sell one of those SATs for
[50:44] you know that's a 30% tax I'm just
[50:46] paying on my cup of coffee I don't I
[50:47] don't know if I want to pay that much
[50:49] tax to just so I can say I'm I'm
[50:51] sticking to the Bitcoin standard you
[50:52] know I'd rather just tap my little Visa
[50:54] card and then pay it off at the end of
[50:55] the month with my other Fiat slave money
[50:58] so
[51:00] um I I think it it just naturally
[51:03] gravitates towards uh a system where
[51:05] some of that those edges are going to
[51:06] smooth out I I think the need for people
[51:08] to try and track down tax cheats and all
[51:10] that that's all AML was ever started
[51:12] from is they said there were these guys
[51:14] that would open Swiss numbered accounts
[51:15] like Wall Street guys they'd make a
[51:17] bunch of money on Wall Street they'd
[51:18] open a swis numbered account they'd dump
[51:20] their money in that they said hey you
[51:21] got to knock that off because you're
[51:22] hiding your tax returns so the Swiss
[51:25] banks started collecting these pools of
[51:27] stock Investments linked to the numbered
[51:29] account so they'd buy all these stocks
[51:30] they get all these gains they'd sell all
[51:32] the stocks and then it would all go back
[51:34] into this pool that these guys could
[51:35] draw from they go well wait which one of
[51:36] you made all the gains on the stocks
[51:38] they go we can't tell because it's a
[51:39] number to account they go oh we're not
[51:40] doing that AML law here you come and
[51:43] they've just built it out ever since
[51:44] then because it's a very convenient tool
[51:46] for Beed little bean counters who were
[51:47] control freaks to go like I want to know
[51:49] more about what you're doing but uh but
[51:52] again like all all our freedom was
[51:54] already evaporated so the fear of the
[51:57] next Draconian sort of Mega opolis you
[52:00] know
[52:00] Opticon tendril cbdc I think they a
[52:04] little overblown it's still dangerous I
[52:05] still don't support it I hope no one
[52:07] listening to this goes this guy's all
[52:09] for CBD it's nothing like that I'm just
[52:11] saying like as a practical matter I
[52:13] think it's less um it's less like Darth
[52:16] Vader and more just kind of like just
[52:18] that annoying guy at work that you go
[52:20] God this guy's such an you like
[52:21] wish you just leave me alone so I don't
[52:24] know if that answers the question but
[52:25] that's kind of my thoughts on the matter
[52:28] I love that because it's more realistic
[52:30] uh and I heard it's so interesting when
[52:33] I talk with people from Africa they
[52:36] really don't care about cbdcs like they
[52:39] could care they could care less about it
[52:41] when I talk with German guys they really
[52:43] afraid of cbdcs like they're really like
[52:45] oh cbdcs they want to control more and
[52:48] stuff like that I mean there also a lot
[52:50] of already a lot of rules and
[52:53] regulations in Germany so like and then
[52:55] cbdcs you have more control like it it
[52:58] it's an easier sell uh in in in in
[53:01] Africa like how many people are even
[53:02] banked so like it's a whole whole
[53:05] another discussion about that um another
[53:09] question is like do you see as as
[53:11] Bitcoin adoption is is for you El
[53:14] Salvador a good role model is is that
[53:16] like we have still the Fiat system but
[53:19] we introduce Bitcoin as a legal system
[53:21] there's no taxable event uh the
[53:24] government slowly starts buying Bitcoin
[53:27] um like that's basically they started
[53:29] mining also Bitcoin that's basically
[53:30] their their Bitcoin play they did a lot
[53:32] of other things to make more attractive
[53:34] but this has barely something to do with
[53:36] Bitcoin with the free passports and and
[53:38] the gangs and stuff like that but uh the
[53:41] integrating Bitcoin as a legal tender
[53:43] integrating Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[53:44] integrating Bitcoin mining to make some
[53:47] cash flow even from that uh is that the
[53:49] is that the handbook for for Global
[53:51] adoption in in the future for all
[53:54] countries potentially I I I think the
[53:57] thing that's going to happen is like
[53:58] people have been saying for years
[53:59] there's a supply shock coming right like
[54:01] it's going to get crazy and people are
[54:03] going to start going oh my God like look
[54:05] at number go up and people will point to
[54:09] the 2021 runup and they go oh my god
[54:11] look how much Bitcoin you know
[54:12] exponential growth from like 2009 to
[54:15] 2021 or 2011 to 2021 if you will you go
[54:19] there was this amazing run I go yeah but
[54:21] that was all like just guys like you and
[54:23] me just kind of going we Bitcoin you
[54:24] know and then you got a bunch of stimy
[54:25] checks and guys like you and me are
[54:27] sitting at you know working from home or
[54:29] whatever you go hey I'll got an extra
[54:30] 2400 bucks on my stimy check this month
[54:32] like off to bitcoin because I'm kind of
[54:34] taken care of already I'm not worried
[54:35] about it and so you get this big huge
[54:37] runup but it's a retail blowup I mean it
[54:39] was it's sort of meming at that point
[54:42] right right now the people that are
[54:43] meming are Black Rock and Fidelity and
[54:46] Bank of America and JP Morgan and you
[54:48] know like these these major institutions
[54:51] are now getting into the meme phase for
[54:53] themselves uh but those guys are
[54:55] bringing stacks right and you like I
[54:57] think you posted a chart you know of
[54:59] like all these um like corporations
[55:01] stuff that are putting Bitcoin on the
[55:03] balance sheets and so to your question
[55:05] about El Salvador I think what's going
[55:06] to happen is
[55:08] like it's like if you had bought like
[55:11] Amazon stock and you had this balance
[55:12] portfolio or something like that you
[55:13] know as your stock increases you
[55:16] rebalance right like that's the very
[55:18] common thing to do you go well I'm
[55:19] overweighted on Amazon now so I'm going
[55:20] to cut that down to here but if you
[55:23] caught Amazon at the right time there
[55:25] could have been a time where you had
[55:26] like let's say a $10,000 portfolio
[55:27] $1,000 of it was Amazon and then the
[55:30] rest was like stocks bonds whatever
[55:31] mutual fund crap whatever composition
[55:34] you have for that thing and then you had
[55:36] this big huge runup so it's like oh my
[55:37] god Amazon is 90% of my balance sheet
[55:40] now like how do you rebalance that
[55:42] because it's it just went from this one
[55:43] sliver you didn't add anything to it it
[55:45] just magnified so much that it's
[55:47] overtaken everything else and if you
[55:48] just think about how much Bitcoin elator
[55:50] carrying on their balance sheet right
[55:52] now because right now it's sort of
[55:53] fluctuating people kind of I don't know
[55:54] what's going to happen with the price
[55:55] and there's still that sort of
[55:57] speculative kind of thing but when the
[55:59] supply crunch actually hits because as
[56:02] every Bank sees what someone else is
[56:04] doing they go well how come we're not we
[56:06] should probably just do that too but
[56:08] they're they're on autopilot they don't
[56:09] they're not thinking about this and some
[56:11] of these things are going to become
[56:12] passively invested they just oh just
[56:14] allocate 1% whatever we don't want to
[56:15] miss it and so when those flows start
[56:18] coming in and they run into legit
[56:20] scarcity then all of a sudden number
[56:22] goes up like it's going to make the 2021
[56:24] thing look like you're going to go it's
[56:25] going to be a blip this big on the chart
[56:28] people are going to go oh my God you you
[56:29] could get Bitcoin for that because it's
[56:31] like $3 billion dollar today or
[56:33] something but if it gets to that and El
[56:35] Salvador's balance sheet is all of a
[56:36] sudden like well it's 98% Bitcoin just
[56:39] because number went up so much the rest
[56:41] of their balance of accounts like
[56:42] everything they fund their government is
[56:44] on is like you can't even see it on the
[56:45] pie chart anymore you go well what's
[56:47] that do to Global adoption people just
[56:49] go oops oh we should probably get that
[56:52] going but it it fundamentally changes
[56:54] how they do stuff and that their mind it
[56:56] and you know they're just getting
[56:58] basically free energy they got a volcano
[57:00] sitting in the middle of the country and
[57:01] they just go hey we get free Bitcoin out
[57:02] of this this is cool but I I think
[57:04] people really underestimate the power of
[57:06] like what number when it really goes up
[57:08] what number go up is going to look like
[57:09] and to those even you know like relative
[57:13] to Michael sailor El Salvador's Holdings
[57:15] are kind of smallish right but relative
[57:16] to me like it's going oh my God these
[57:18] guys have a ton of Bitcoin but everybody
[57:21] as that starts going up it it has that
[57:24] effect of other people ramping up it's
[57:26] just like a speculative Mania in 2020
[57:29] 2021 except it's corporations and
[57:31] finance companies but sooner or later
[57:33] that Smooths out that curve gets to a
[57:35] place where everyone's just holding it
[57:37] and the like you know the the notion of
[57:38] getting rid of it is absurd but if
[57:41] you're country there's a ton of
[57:42] countries Ukraine has 46,000 Bitcoin the
[57:45] United States is holding a couple
[57:46] hundred thousand Bitcoin Russia holds X
[57:48] thousands of Bitcoin when number goes up
[57:50] and all of a sudden El Salvador is like
[57:52] the third most powerful nation in the
[57:53] world by GDP right you go oh maybe we
[57:56] shouldn't sell this Bitcoin anymore
[57:58] maybe we should just incorporate that
[57:59] under the treasury balance sheets and
[58:01] and I think that's probably how it comes
[58:03] around is is just this massive wall of
[58:06] adoption and massive amounts of number
[58:08] go up and the people that are already
[58:09] holding are just going to not want to
[58:11] get rid of it anymore it would be
[58:13] nonsensical to not have it you
[58:15] know and every everyone every country
[58:18] every institution every person every
[58:21] bank has to have like a Bitcoin strategy
[58:23] at some point and most of them don't
[58:26] have till now yeah uh and and those who
[58:29] have now will have a way more um
[58:32] Advanced uh strategy on that I'm I'm
[58:36] often wonder like is is the way till
[58:40] there is the way till this trigger point
[58:42] that this Mass adoption just time is it
[58:45] just time that has to basically pass and
[58:48] then Bitcoin has to function and and has
[58:50] to prove more and more and but is is
[58:53] there anything else that do you see as a
[58:54] main hurdle to to the Bitcoin adoption
[58:56] anything that that you like um it's just
[58:59] time that we have to pass till till this
[59:02] this thing yeah I I think it's
[59:04] inevitable I really do um and it's an
[59:07] exponential curve right like if you look
[59:10] at the derivatives market for instance
[59:12] right um that's the over counter
[59:14] derivatives Market the thing that blew
[59:16] up the world in 2008 the thing is still
[59:17] a gaping black hole out in the economy
[59:19] right now uh that was an exponential
[59:22] growth curve and so you had people like
[59:24] Allen Greenspan in 1999 or 2,000 going I
[59:27] think the risks are mitigated here and
[59:29] and you know you had Warren Buffett
[59:30] going like these things are a financial
[59:32] Time Bomb like a nuclear bomb and what
[59:35] they didn't anticipate though is is
[59:37] because of the way the derivatives trade
[59:39] they started off with like $60 billion
[59:42] you know being hedged in the derivatives
[59:45] Market by 2008 that had blown up to 600
[59:48] trillion you go what wait what how did
[59:51] and the thing is I don't think anyone
[59:53] was just like yeah let's let's pump this
[59:54] thing up to the Moon until we can just
[59:56] absolutely fracture the entire global
[59:58] economy I think what happened was just
[60:00] Mass adoption right these guys just went
[60:02] oh those guys are doing it we got to do
[60:04] it we better get in on this oh a number
[60:06] go up hey that's cool let's keep doing
[60:07] it and then one day it just it sort of
[60:10] trickled along and then it just went
[60:12] Boop you know that exponential growth
[60:13] occurred and then everybody stopped in
[60:16] 2008 went wait what do we build here and
[60:17] they go oh that's you don't want to look
[60:19] under that hood dude because that's bad
[60:22] and uh but that that's what exponential
[60:24] curves look like that's a negative
[60:26] exponential growth right you go like oh
[60:28] we exponentially grew a bubble that we
[60:30] can't fill like there's a hole that we
[60:32] can't fill Bitcoin is the opposite of
[60:34] that bubble but I think it happens the
[60:36] same way I think people just go oh yeah
[60:37] oh they're getting on bitcoin we should
[60:38] get on bitcoin oh number go up I wish
[60:40] should get some more Bitcoin and then
[60:41] next thing you know everyone just goes
[60:43] and they go oh oh oh my God like what
[60:46] happened here but when they look around
[60:48] the world looks very different than when
[60:49] you're standing on top of a $600 pit or
[60:52] a $600 trillion do Pit you're staying on
[60:54] top of a $600 trillion doll asset you're
[60:56] going oh this hey this is kind of cool
[60:58] up here like a lot of our problems just
[61:00] went away and we don't even have to play
[61:02] this game anymore because look at all
[61:04] you know we fixed this debt Mountain we
[61:07] fixed this need to issue all this debt
[61:09] we can now focus on things like quality
[61:11] or we can just not do this anymore I can
[61:13] just go on vacation with my kids I
[61:14] cannot sit here and grind 12 hours a day
[61:16] in a Wall Street firm trying to grind
[61:18] out like you said gambling and trading
[61:20] and just you know and sacrificing family
[61:22] and everything just for Fiat bucks
[61:26] and I I think a lot of that stuff just
[61:27] drifts away you know and then you go
[61:29] what's the world look like there you go
[61:31] I don't know but I think it's going to
[61:32] be pretty awesome like I think it'll be
[61:33] very very different than what we're used
[61:34] to I would hesitate to make any
[61:37] predictions and yet I think just these
[61:39] Notions of like how we enforce territory
[61:41] and property and and why people are even
[61:43] incentivized to do that you go it just
[61:46] it stops making sense if you go like I
[61:48] can either hustle you for five bucks or
[61:50] I can just buy this thing and get 50
[61:51] bucks you go I'll just buy the thing get
[61:53] 50 bucks you know it uh yeah I I think
[61:58] it's going to be quick and and I don't
[62:00] think anything stops that like you know
[62:02] it's it's fun to say nothing stops this
[62:03] train I just don't think people have
[62:05] quite wrapped their head around what an
[62:07] exponential growth curve in Bitcoin
[62:08] adoption looks like because it's going
[62:09] to be insane I think I think it's just
[62:12] going to be where people just because we
[62:15] don't have a model for it right we've
[62:16] never had something like this like I
[62:18] said it's the first time in human
[62:19] history when you had something that's
[62:21] got this monetary value this this asset
[62:23] value and it's scarce like you can't get
[62:26] more of it so when it happens it's that
[62:30] gradually then suddenly well I think the
[62:32] then suddenly is going to it's going to
[62:34] be that face melting kind of it but it
[62:37] but it's all positive like it doesn't
[62:38] hurt anybody when it goes up right like
[62:40] nobody gets harmed from that from that
[62:42] growth so it's it lifts all boats even
[62:45] people that don't have it their boats
[62:46] are going to get better because you know
[62:48] their stuff becomes less expensive they
[62:49] have
[62:50] less it's easier for them to get by and
[62:53] even people that go Bitcoin I would
[62:54] never own that don't understand it can't
[62:56] understand it can barely check their
[62:57] email don't think about it they just
[62:59] care about watching football or rugby or
[63:01] whatever they're just going to be
[63:03] looking around going hey things are
[63:04] better I don't know I'm going to go have
[63:05] a barbecue I'm going drink beer with my
[63:07] buddies this weekend and and I only work
[63:09] 20 hours this week because my boss said
[63:10] I could go home so I don't know it's
[63:11] cool um and they won't know that it's
[63:13] Bitcoin that did that it'll just be life
[63:15] is better and I think that's how it
[63:17] plays out because who would want to stop
[63:20] it at that point you know like who's
[63:22] going to go no we can't have all this
[63:24] success and and peace this is terrible
[63:26] like we need to interfere with this as
[63:28] quickly as possible you know it just it
[63:30] stops making sense and it starts looking
[63:32] the arguments against it start looking
[63:33] really absurd and you kind of
[63:35] go yeah pretty much everybody's just
[63:38] even the people that are Die Hard Peter
[63:40] Schiff sooner or later is just going to
[63:41] go okay fine it's a good idea you and
[63:44] hop on board so that that's kind of how
[63:46] I see things plan out yeah I hope for
[63:49] pet shift that he has at least a little
[63:51] bit of a Bitcoin uh unfor because if if
[63:54] he watches his in I don't know since
[63:56] 2012 or what the first debates were then
[64:00] he he made I mean there there's this
[64:02] memes where he his face gets older and
[64:04] older and like gold price goes down and
[64:06] bitcoin price goes up but will be
[64:08] interesting to see um I also really love
[64:10] how you describe it and I'm also really
[64:12] a big believer in only a small portion
[64:16] of the uh population will ever
[64:18] understand Bitcoin like there will not
[64:20] be like not all of the sudden just
[64:22] because Bitcoin is is now here all of
[64:25] the 70% of the population is sound money
[64:28] in AUST economics experts this this will
[64:30] not happen even though it would be
[64:31] awesome uh but it will not happen but
[64:34] they will have Bitcoin in some capacity
[64:37] because they will have maybe an ETF
[64:39] where there's companies in there that
[64:41] only hold Bitcoin they might get
[64:44] compensated bonuses with with Bitcoin
[64:46] because the company uh gives gives
[64:49] Bitcoin out or uh they might even get
[64:51] paid in something that is backed by
[64:53] Bitcoin like this this whole High system
[64:56] and then we might end up at a full
[64:59] Bitcoin standard even though I I think
[65:01] this is far away even for me even though
[65:04] I'm just 25 years old I don't know if I
[65:06] actually see it in my lifetime let's see
[65:09] um
[65:10] but even now like even now Tesla owns
[65:14] Bitcoin Tesla's in the S&P 500 how many
[65:17] people own on on own the S&P 500 a lot
[65:19] of people so all those technically own a
[65:23] really small amount of Bitcoin but even
[65:26] even that is is is true and when Michael
[65:28] S with Michael strategy gets involved
[65:30] and then maybe in 10 years U almost all
[65:34] S&P 500 companies have uh that that
[65:37] Bitcoin baging and this is where it
[65:38] comes gets difficult because as you said
[65:41] this exponential uh growth phase is
[65:44] really hard to understand because people
[65:47] overestimate what what's happening in
[65:49] the next like one two years but they
[65:51] completely underestimate what's
[65:52] happening in 10 years 20 years time and
[65:55] this will be will be fun to see I'm I'm
[65:58] I I'm I'm always stoked when I talk to
[66:00] bitcoiners and I'm like I should I have
[66:01] to buy more Bitcoin but I'm already all
[66:04] in so this this trrain is hard to get in
[66:08] um before I get to the endro of the
[66:10] podcast I want to get one more topic
[66:12] down because uh Seinfield is actually my
[66:15] most favorite series of all time I'm a
[66:18] big fan of that uh and that's why I just
[66:22] wanted to ask like how did you get into
[66:24] that like how was that that that that
[66:26] thing I I also saw like because I'm an
[66:29] extra big fan I saw one thing where
[66:32] Seinfeld and the the actors and um I
[66:36] forgot the name of the the director who
[66:39] who directed it uh they talked about
[66:41] like stories how they like made the
[66:42] script and how they developed signin and
[66:45] how they like even made some some
[66:48] episodes who like touched some edges uh
[66:50] and it was it was fun to fun to see this
[66:53] this things um how was it to to get in
[66:55] there and and how was the that
[66:57] experience and how did you get uh into
[66:59] Seinfeld um well it it wasn't just
[67:02] Seinfeld like uh the company I work for
[67:04] there there's like the there's a part of
[67:06] the show where they shoot the show like
[67:07] what we're doing right now and then
[67:09] there's the part you're going to do
[67:10] after this which is the editing and the
[67:11] cutting and the post- production and
[67:12] clean up the sound and all that kind of
[67:14] stuff so I worked with a company that
[67:15] did that and I got there like right in
[67:18] the early 90s and so if you're unaware
[67:21] like there was a time when you couldn't
[67:22] do this right like this like digital
[67:24] recording and HD 4K was just it required
[67:27] an insane amount of horsepower at the
[67:29] time um so my company sort of bridged
[67:32] that Gap there was a time where like all
[67:34] television shows were cut on film like
[67:36] there would be a room full of 50 guys
[67:38] that would have reels of film and they'd
[67:39] cut each one according to a cut list and
[67:41] then they'd Stitch it all up and then
[67:43] they have to make prints of that and
[67:44] then you know then they'd strike that
[67:46] off to a videotape sooner after a
[67:49] while uh we sort of became a middle step
[67:52] where we could transfer directly to
[67:53] digital and then edit digitally but but
[67:55] on tapes right like these are these big
[67:57] sort of professional type tapes and the
[68:00] company I worked for was particularly
[68:02] good at not only forming those
[68:04] relationships with the studios but doing
[68:06] that process um and so we basically put
[68:09] all the film editing guys out of
[68:10] business because we could do it all
[68:12] digitally and then the computer guys
[68:13] came along and like we could do with 10
[68:15] people what they took 50 or 60 people to
[68:17] do well the computer guys came along and
[68:19] could do with two people what it took us
[68:21] 10 or 15 people to do so we kind of
[68:23] evaporated in the middle of it but it
[68:25] was right during that time that like
[68:26] Frasier Seinfeld uh we did a lot of
[68:29] post- production for film films at the
[68:32] time um and a lot of broadcast
[68:34] duplication things like that so it's not
[68:36] like I was hanging out with Seinfeld
[68:38] going hey buddy let going you know like
[68:39] what's on the next episode uh but I did
[68:41] get to see some kind of interesting
[68:43] stuff around that but I basically
[68:46] stumbled into it I really did like I was
[68:48] working at a clothing store of all
[68:49] things and the lady I worked with her
[68:51] husband was the chief engineer there and
[68:53] he was this kind of character big wild
[68:54] hair guy and just hey man you should
[68:56] come by and work over here and you know
[68:57] and then you'd wander off and get a
[68:58] pizza or something like that and I
[69:01] didn't know anything about the film
[69:02] industry I didn't know anything about
[69:03] post production I I just wandered in and
[69:05] I saw a bunch of people in nice clothes
[69:07] running around carrying paper and
[69:08] looking really stressed about stuff and
[69:11] and movie posters all over the place and
[69:12] this like sort of a macket looking
[69:14] building and I was kind like oh I don't
[69:15] know what's happening here but it looks
[69:16] pretty cool I want to be part of this
[69:18] and then I just didn't quit like it's a
[69:20] pretty nightmarish job it's it's you
[69:22] know it demands a lot of time it's a 247
[69:25] business and like if there's a broadcast
[69:26] date or if there's a film release date
[69:28] or something like that it's it's not
[69:29] flexible like they can't say oh we
[69:31] didn't finish the show this week let's
[69:32] just do it next week like that just
[69:34] doesn't happen right and if they go hey
[69:35] we're releasing a movie to 3500 theaters
[69:37] H can we do it tomorrow instead of today
[69:39] like it's you know it just doesn't
[69:40] happen so they they place a lot of
[69:42] Demands on your time and sacrific a lot
[69:44] of time and stuff like that with family
[69:46] and friends and important things just to
[69:48] be part of that
[69:49] industry um so that's how I kind of got
[69:52] into it uh a friend of mine was actually
[69:54] one of the assistant editors like in our
[69:56] house and like when they did the final
[69:57] episode of of Seinfeld this is probably
[70:00] the most interesting story I have about
[70:01] Seinfeld was they they literally shut
[70:04] down the building like they wouldn't let
[70:05] anybody come to work like they canceled
[70:07] all the edit Suites they canceled all
[70:09] the film transfers everything it was
[70:11] just the editor the assistant editor and
[70:13] the producer and that's those are the
[70:15] only people that were allowed in the
[70:16] building while they cut this final
[70:17] episode of Seinfeld and then when I saw
[70:19] it I was like that I couldn't come to
[70:21] work that day because of this this you
[70:23] know I wasn't too impressed with the
[70:24] finale but some people liked it I guess
[70:26] I don't know but it was pretty weird
[70:28] just watching how much security they
[70:30] they Incorporated around just that one
[70:32] final episode but yeah but other than
[70:34] that it was just you you get to see a
[70:36] lot because you're looking at the behind
[70:37] the scenes like between takes of what
[70:39] they're doing and you kind of get some
[70:40] insight into what that production
[70:41] process looks like but yeah like I said
[70:43] it wasn't like I was hanging out with
[70:44] the film crew or anything like that so
[70:47] yeah I was also a little bit uh I mean
[70:50] I'm always um not satisfied with Fales
[70:53] like the last episode I never saw a
[70:56] really good finale uh but with that I
[70:59] was really not satisfied I mean it was
[71:01] cool to see them all in the court and
[71:02] and have those those past characters
[71:04] come in and and all the scenes but uh in
[71:07] general I'm like there a lot of things
[71:09] that could could have been done but it's
[71:11] it's it's an amazing series I love it I
[71:14] think uh I think probably I have seen
[71:17] all the episodes on average like two or
[71:19] three times already it's like uh it's
[71:21] it's I'm I'm the guy kind of a guy that
[71:24] does not watch a lot of team
[71:25] but when it's like the same thing all
[71:28] over that's weird but yeah um uh before
[71:33] we get to the end routine uh what are
[71:36] you currently I mean it's kind of my end
[71:37] routine already because I'm asking all
[71:39] my questions but all my my guest this
[71:41] question what are you currently
[71:43] extremely passionate about which we did
[71:45] not touch on in the podcast anything
[71:47] that comes to your
[71:49] mind uh oddly enough I would say no like
[71:53] we we talked about the stuff that I'm
[71:54] super passion about right now like all
[71:56] my focus right now is on on writing this
[71:59] book and promoting Bitcoin you know and
[72:02] outside of that I'm pretty dull you know
[72:04] like I like to golf once in a while and
[72:06] I'm terrible at it but you know that
[72:08] that was a passion but all those all
[72:10] these things that used to be something I
[72:11] might have considered a passion felt
[72:13] very Fiat to me now you know like I look
[72:15] back and that's kind of a waste of time
[72:16] like maybe play video games or something
[72:18] dick around on the computer but the rest
[72:20] of the time is just thinking about
[72:21] Bitcoin like how can I talk to people
[72:23] better about Bitcoin how can I promote
[72:24] Bitcoin better
[72:26] um and it's sort of the mission I've put
[72:28] myself on I go I just want to spread as
[72:30] much knowledge and information as I can
[72:31] about Bitcoin I want as many people as I
[72:33] know to get involved with it to think
[72:35] about it to talk about it and uh you
[72:38] know even where I work right now I'm I'm
[72:41] I I probably shouldn't say it out loud
[72:43] but I'm I'm trying to push them towards
[72:44] like adopting that uh and you know and
[72:48] kind of tracing it up to government
[72:49] level in terms of people adopting it and
[72:51] holding it and using it and the
[72:52] Wisconsin pension fund has made it huge
[72:55] usually easier to even just start having
[72:56] those
[72:57] conversations but it's I I kind of
[73:00] consider my process similar to what
[73:01] sailor's been going through for the last
[73:02] few years like how can I refine my
[73:04] message to a place where I can get the
[73:06] most people to understand why this is
[73:07] important why they need to be part of it
[73:09] and I also consider it kind of a Duty
[73:11] right I just go Hey look it's it's like
[73:13] Noah and the Ark you go hey flood's
[73:15] coming you might want to hop on and I I
[73:18] don't like the cynical view that says oh
[73:20] well if you don't get it drown like I go
[73:22] no how about we help these people get up
[73:24] you know like Let's help as many people
[73:26] get on this boat as we can and
[73:28] ultimately I you know if if I take it
[73:30] away from the Doom and Gloom Noah's Arc
[73:31] scenario and I just take it into like
[73:33] well the more people we get on the
[73:34] sooner we get that exponential curve
[73:36] that you were talking about you go I see
[73:38] it in 10 years I go I could see it in
[73:39] two like these things happen boom and
[73:41] they go quick and when they start
[73:43] running it it's it's pretty astonishing
[73:46] what happens it will be disruptive
[73:48] certainly and yet for all those people
[73:51] that don't get it their their lives will
[73:53] get better like if you know I think Eric
[73:55] Stax it was your show that I found Eric
[73:57] STA and that guy's been hugely sort of
[73:59] transformative in my perspective on a
[74:01] lot of things around Bitcoin um but he
[74:04] talks about like housing you go like
[74:06] well right now 40% of the houses in the
[74:08] United States of America are rentals
[74:10] which means someone owns a house they
[74:11] don't need so they can make money
[74:12] because they're trying to protect
[74:13] themselves from inflation etc etc etc so
[74:15] what happens if you put 40% of the
[74:16] houses back on the market H well makes
[74:19] it easier for everyone to buy a house
[74:20] right and you go well what happens if we
[74:22] don't have to pay a premium for stocks
[74:24] and all this kind of stuff and you know
[74:25] then these companies if they're just
[74:27] holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet
[74:28] and they don't have to keep trying to
[74:30] push a premium and push their revenues
[74:32] and take on debt and do all this they
[74:33] can just like take whatever meager
[74:35] profits they have they put them in
[74:36] Bitcoin it goes up and they go oh we
[74:37] don't have to worry about cutting costs
[74:39] and reducing quality and and
[74:41] centralizing further and further we can
[74:43] start specializing we can increase
[74:44] quality and our bank our balance sheet
[74:46] keeps going up so so everybody benefits
[74:49] from that sort of positive feedback loop
[74:51] even people that don't know what Bitcoin
[74:53] is and would never buy one if it you
[74:55] know but all of a sudden their stuff is
[74:56] cheaper and they can afford a house and
[74:58] they don't have to work as long or as
[74:59] hard and they still get the things that
[75:01] they like they can still you know buy
[75:03] their beer and but it's getting cheaper
[75:05] every day it's not getting more
[75:06] expensive or the beer that they are
[75:07] buying gets better it's higher quality
[75:09] it's got less toxins and metals and
[75:11] shitty ingredients and whatever but the
[75:13] food gets better the you know everything
[75:14] just starts going so so yes my my energy
[75:18] is fully devoted to seeing that come as
[75:20] quickly as possible because I'm older
[75:22] than you are so I don't know I might not
[75:24] get to see it if I'm not careful I want
[75:26] to I want to make sure I'm as loud of a
[75:28] voice as I can be for whatever worth it
[75:30] it has you know to whoever might find it
[75:33] worthy so I mean my incentive would be
[75:36] to talk about Bitcoin so the
[75:38] adoption is slower so I can stack more
[75:40] [Laughter]
[75:43] right that that that would be my
[75:45] incentive to to get more Bitcoin for the
[75:47] future because I'm
[75:50] 25in sorry guys I was wrong yeah yeah
[75:54] this was a terrible idea never buy back
[75:57] one but uh I'm I'm humble enough to see
[76:00] that I probably have zero to little to
[76:04] zero impact on the Bitcoin price
[76:06] longterm anyway so it's it's Pro
[76:09] probably better for my for for me to to
[76:13] just like be honest with the with the
[76:15] people um our ERS as I said uh the
[76:20] previous guest is asking questions is
[76:22] asking a question for the next guest
[76:24] without knowing who the next guest is
[76:26] it's always interesting because there
[76:28] are really cool questions coming up
[76:30] technical questions coming up weird
[76:32] questions coming up uh and uh deep
[76:34] questions coming up and uh it's it's
[76:37] that one question in the show that is
[76:39] not tailored for the guest for you
[76:42] Daniel uh and the question is how would
[76:45] you get your neighbor to love their
[76:47] neighbor more oh wow you know oddly
[76:51] enough in my line of work it's all a
[76:53] Communication business like I work the
[76:55] criminal justice system here in the
[76:56] United States and a lot of that work is
[76:58] about getting people just to get along
[77:01] um the way I would most try and get
[77:03] neighbors to love each other is to try
[77:05] and humanize both um and you know one of
[77:09] the things if you really want to cut
[77:11] down someone's hatred on somebody just
[77:14] ask the person if they go I hate that
[77:16] guy and I go go that's yeah I can see
[77:18] why you hate him whatever what kind of
[77:20] pizza do you think that guy likes go oh
[77:21] P what do you mean what kind of P well
[77:23] just think about it I mean like look at
[77:24] it you think he's a jerk what kind of
[77:26] pizza does he like it instantly
[77:27] humanizes somebody you know and so it's
[77:30] you have to find things if I want
[77:32] neighbors to heal relations you go you
[77:34] got to make them seem human you got to
[77:36] get somebody out of that Loop of
[77:38] thinking like they did that on purpose
[77:40] it's evil they did this for this and
[77:41] this and this It's Tricky it's not easy
[77:44] but if I had neighbors that hated each
[77:45] other and I really wanted them to get
[77:47] along because it makes my life easier
[77:48] for whatever reason that would be the
[77:50] start would just be because it's it's
[77:53] about effective communication it's about
[77:55] empathetic listening it's about being
[77:56] able to hear someone's point of view and
[78:00] and empathize with it it doesn't mean
[78:01] you have to agree with it but they go I
[78:03] think that guy's the biggest jerk and go
[78:04] I can see why you think that I mean
[78:05] easiest thing in the world even if
[78:07] someone's saying it to me I think you're
[78:08] the biggest jerk I go I can see why you
[78:10] think that like it's not you know how
[78:12] can you say that you're not a jerk they
[78:14] want to fight I'm not a jerk you know I
[78:15] go doesn't matter that they think you're
[78:17] a jerk you're not gonna talk them out of
[78:18] it so may as well just acknowledge it
[78:20] say yeah I can see why you think that
[78:22] and I did it for this this is the reason
[78:24] why this has happened did you think
[78:25] about hey did you know their dog died
[78:27] and what kind of pizza do you think they
[78:28] like what kind of ice cream do you think
[78:30] they like I saw that guy had Maple ice
[78:32] cream can you believe that Maple ice
[78:33] cream he likes Maple ice but it it
[78:35] doesn't change what they're thinking
[78:36] about but all of a sudden it makes that
[78:38] person a person and it helps just Tamp
[78:41] that kind of Stu down so that those
[78:43] would be my
[78:44] steps that that's a those are great
[78:46] steps um where can people find you like
[78:48] is is uh where's the best place to read
[78:52] about your stuff and where's the best
[78:54] place to ask you
[78:56] questions uh well my writing my book you

[79:07] those you know I got about a third of it
[79:10] maybe done right now and you can also
[79:12] find me on Twitter at tin
[79:14] moneytv and that's uh where I sometimes
[79:16] post occasionally interesting stuff and
[79:18] usually just post a lot
