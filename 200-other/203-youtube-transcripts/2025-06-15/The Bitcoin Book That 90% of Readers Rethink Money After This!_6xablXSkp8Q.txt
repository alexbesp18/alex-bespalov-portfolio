[00:00] When you give someone a book about
[00:01] Bitcoin, it's like look, I want you to
[00:02] learn about Bitcoin. But I noticed that
[00:04] maybe half of the people didn't read it
[00:06] because it's like I'm telling like you
[00:08] should learn about Bitcoin and they are
[00:09] not ready for that. I said I want to
[00:11] have this book that is that is easy that
[00:13] is for normals that it has some
[00:14] interesting stories, real stories. They
[00:16] has this philosophy without saying that
[00:18] it's philosophy but it's like apply
[00:20] philosophy to the everyday life all the
[00:22] time. So that is interesting. Those
[00:24] introduce them to principles of of
[00:25] philosophy, you know, to low time
[00:27] preference to understand that, you know,
[00:30] hard work is needed to understand that
[00:32] there's some things out there in the
[00:34] world that we need to rethink because
[00:36] they are not as they seem to be and we
[00:38] already have the symptoms there. If any
[00:40] Bitcoiner wants to orange peel their
[00:42] loved ones, they can do it this way.
[00:47] [Music]
[00:49] Give us a little bit of an overview of
[00:51] of of what you what you're doing. Uh and
[00:53] what are you also doing with with
[00:54] Bitcoin? Yeah. So, as a short intro,
[00:58] like a lot of people, I don't know how
[01:00] many, but being very honest, I joined
[01:02] Bitcoin just thinking like, okay, yeah,
[01:04] let's let's make a lot of money quick.
[01:06] Went definitely the wrong way. Like, I
[01:08] had no direction. So, I remember in
[01:11] 2021, I heard N talking about Bitcoin. I
[01:14] like, okay, so I'm Salvadorian. He's
[01:17] talking about Bitcoin. I should maybe
[01:18] learn this Bitcoin thing. I ended up
[01:21] doing NFTs, which kind of a shame. It it
[01:25] was a hard lesson. I ended up paying
[01:28] everyone back in the community because I
[01:29] said like people had other expectations.
[01:32] Um a really good friend of mine from
[01:34] Egypt, Apple,
[01:36] he he noticed this and he told me like
[01:38] hey know some here's a book. So he gave
[01:41] me Safe Dian's book the Bitcoin standard
[01:44] and I regret not having read it like the
[01:46] moment that he gave it to me. It took me
[01:48] six months to open that book, but once I
[01:50] open it, it just like for the first time
[01:54] I I felt that I had a a clear direction
[01:56] of something that I need to explore a
[01:58] little bit more. It took me around maybe
[02:00] like 2,000 two and a half thousand hours
[02:03] just like going into different parts of
[02:06] Bitcoin. I'm more fond of the
[02:08] philosophical part of it. I don't know.
[02:10] For some reason, I just discovered
[02:11] philosophy recently in my life. I'm 34
[02:14] now, so it's quite late. I wish I did it
[02:16] 20 years ago. But I mean because it just
[02:20] helped me structure the life and I
[02:21] thought that all of this I was into
[02:23] Bitcoin. I just said like okay so I'm
[02:25] not here to to be rich quick. I'm here
[02:27] to you know like learn how to live
[02:29] better. So I like I like when I when I
[02:31] met other Bitcoiners everyone is calmer
[02:34] you know everyone is you know like not
[02:36] trying to rush. Uh everyone is looking
[02:39] quality for quality over quantity. And I
[02:42] really like that. And I said like, okay,
[02:43] I want to stay here. But I ended up I
[02:46] select volunteering. And today I I
[02:48] volunteer and I do a lot of stuff. I
[02:50] spend a lot of my my time every single
[02:52] week uh supporting Bitcoin without being
[02:55] paid for many of these things because I
[02:57] really like the vision. So I feel that
[02:59] that's kind of like the natural
[03:00] progress. So maybe not a not a biggie
[03:02] here.
[03:04] I have a feeling that most people also
[03:06] went through some similar thing like
[03:08] gambling and then it's like okay this is
[03:11] interesting this is cool and then
[03:12] eventually just like uh having a little
[03:15] bit more of the enlightenment. So with
[03:17] that in
[03:18] mind in 2021 I decided to just like
[03:21] steer like what I was doing. So started
[03:24] with the whole crypto stuff but quickly
[03:26] in like a transformation of maybe one
[03:28] and a half years uh went full Bitcoin
[03:30] and today I help um or I work with with
[03:34] other Bitcoin projects or companies that
[03:36] want to include Bitcoin in topics around
[03:37] education and visualization and
[03:40] particularly visualization and education
[03:42] started opening some opportunities to
[03:45] let's say like collaborate and advise
[03:47] the Salvadorian government and this is
[03:50] like the main reason uh to be here. I
[03:53] mean, I just felt like this Call of
[03:54] Duty, I should go back home. I have to
[03:56] take responsibility and this is a place
[04:00] where, you know, like I grew up, I know
[04:02] the culture and I just bring some some
[04:04] of the knowledge the and and hopefully a
[04:06] little bit of wisdom that I that I
[04:07] acquire in living in in Europe. Um,
[04:11] well, that's that's what took me here
[04:13] and that's what we're doing now.
[04:14] Amazing. So, you're now an entire
[04:16] Salvadorian uh government uh in in for
[04:20] what exactly? Well, I mean I cannot go
[04:23] into details but I can tell what what I
[04:27] care about and that is related to the
[04:29] projects that I work. So I care about
[04:32] topics around innovation and
[04:33] entrepreneurship about having the
[04:35] right the right law. Uh second I care
[04:39] about the topics around economics. So
[04:42] very much like other countries. So El
[04:43] Salvador has a problem with like a high
[04:47] leverage of depth and I believe this
[04:51] needs to be solved because it's kind of
[04:52] like a like a ticking bomb. But I mean
[04:54] most other countries have similar
[04:56] problems. Here in there's one it's not
[04:59] even a legal financial tool. It's
[05:01] something that is called kum and a kam
[05:03] means I owe you. So let's say that a
[05:06] company needs to pay you two and a half
[05:08] thousand bucks. So they come to you and
[05:11] say like Robin uh here's the payment
[05:13] here's,500 bucks and here is a kan like
[05:17] an I owe you 4,000 and it's just a paper
[05:20] saying like I owe you,000 more. And the
[05:22] thing is that this can I mean you can
[05:25] imagine how how this can be dangerous
[05:27] very quickly but these scans have have
[05:28] been like adopted so strongly that
[05:32] virtually every company is using them.
[05:35] So my impression is that a lot of
[05:38] companies are kind of just like playing
[05:41] this game of catching up with debt, you
[05:44] know, issuing more cadence, getting
[05:46] other kons and yeah and I believe that
[05:49] that needs to be solved so that we can
[05:52] have a healthier a healthier you know
[05:54] like economical environment here,
[05:56] healthier business environment. And
[05:58] talking about health yeah the third
[06:00] topic is health. So now there are a lot
[06:03] of topics around agriculture and health
[06:06] going on and it's just imperative to to
[06:10] just like go in there and I mean you can
[06:12] imagine that you're going to be like
[06:14] expert in all these things. So what I
[06:16] focus on is um helping like the people
[06:20] that we work with get some structure
[06:23] u mostly like your workshops visualize
[06:25] what's going on so that everyone can
[06:27] understand and jump in uh make sure to
[06:30] democratize the process. So that usually
[06:32] like here on Salvador we have a very
[06:33] loud culture. So uh you will hear a lot
[06:36] of people a lot of Europeans will say
[06:38] like oh people scream here all the time
[06:40] but it's just like we we are very loud
[06:41] naturally but that means that at work
[06:44] you have people that are a little bit
[06:45] more quiet people that are louder and
[06:48] usually the louder people are the ones
[06:49] that are right. So by democratizing the
[06:52] process with worship style formats then
[06:54] you allow the silent people who have
[06:56] been listening more of the time than
[06:59] than talking to also express their
[07:00] opinions and their opinions have the
[07:02] same value. So um applying this and just
[07:06] basics of game theory uh you know just
[07:08] trying to help everyone understand
[07:11] incentives because when you create any
[07:13] law any regulation you have to think
[07:15] about okay yeah what what's going to
[07:18] happen just one tiny example let's say
[07:20] that um usually like Europe the US or
[07:24] Salvador most countries just try to like
[07:27] ban let's say like pesticides or
[07:30] herbicides that are for sure like cancer
[07:32] originals
[07:33] So conserenic, sorry. And the crazy
[07:36] thing is that if you go and ban one
[07:38] thing, you can literally maybe add like
[07:40] a drop of water, a drop of sugar, a drop
[07:42] of chlorine, then you have a a whole new
[07:44] substance that is not banned and that's
[07:47] it. So you know, so you have to think
[07:49] about how how you proceed with it. Maybe
[07:51] like blacklist is not the way. Maybe
[07:52] white list is the way. and and then you
[07:55] know you have a whole other bunch of
[07:57] issues and you need to think how like
[07:58] good actors and bad actors you know will
[08:01] react to to the incentives that you
[08:03] build. So this kind of stuff we're doing
[08:05] all the time but it's extremely exciting
[08:08] and someone who possibly you might have
[08:11] uh soon on your podcast Adam Adam is my
[08:14] partner in all of this. So we are just
[08:17] trying to be patriotic and do our best
[08:20] here. That's super exciting. Uh and you
[08:24] also wrote uh a book called wait
[08:27] unstable innovation. What was the
[08:30] subtitle? Unstable innovation. The
[08:32] fragile state most will never understand
[08:34] which uh I what do you mean by that?
[08:37] Yeah. Well, unstable innovation tries to
[08:40] catch in two words what's going on. A
[08:44] lot of people and this goes a little bit
[08:45] into why I I wrote it. Um so my general
[08:50] feeling is that most people around me um
[08:53] and I I feel that most people around me
[08:55] are well off but still most people
[08:56] around me are not having the the nicest
[08:59] time. So in general I mean you see it in
[09:02] the news, you see it in social media. Uh
[09:05] people are kind of stressed. They feel
[09:07] that there's a lot of pressure going on.
[09:09] Technology is compounding, accelerating
[09:12] and this creates a lot of uncertainty.
[09:14] Uncertainty creates chaos. like the
[09:17] chaos is like full of programs and
[09:19] people just go and live through all of
[09:21] this like like like like chronology and
[09:23] they they stick with the process they
[09:25] stick with the stress. So when I wrote
[09:29] this title, I wanted to call it unstable
[09:30] innovation so that people understand
[09:32] okay so there's like some fragile thing
[09:34] going on that therefore unstable uh but
[09:37] it's because we're having innovation and
[09:39] what I try to do what I attempt to do is
[09:42] to write what is let's call it like a
[09:46] philosophy book basics of philosophy
[09:48] book disguise or package as an
[09:51] innovation entrepreneurship book so
[09:53] basically it's like applying basic
[09:54] principles of philosophy to example
[09:56] around innovation, entrepreneurship so
[09:59] that I can attempt to help people
[10:02] structure their own lives because that's
[10:04] what philosophy does at the end. That's
[10:05] why it's so cool. Once you once you get
[10:08] it and you're in a really difficult
[10:10] situation, a really challenging
[10:13] life-threatening maybe like what I would
[10:14] call a moment of truth situation, then
[10:18] you have that structure to just get out
[10:20] of it and get out of it and and and
[10:23] stand up again and try to fly again. So
[10:25] I wrote this book because I believe that
[10:27] in the next decade or two for most
[10:29] people times are going to get harder. So
[10:32] with that in mind, I also thought this
[10:33] should be free. So I mean I I don't like
[10:36] market it free like on the website but
[10:39] everywhere else I'm writing. So if
[10:40] someone goes and press on buy, so
[10:42] there's like two Amazon links. Sorry,
[10:43] that's like the necessary evil. When I
[10:45] go to Europe, I also need to have books.
[10:47] So I cannot be carrying books
[10:48] everywhere. But um in the website you go
[10:51] to buy and then you can just like uh
[10:53] press like PDF version and the PDF
[10:54] version once you like when people expect
[10:57] that you have to input your credit card
[10:58] whatever it's like boom h you know hey I
[11:01] see that you have interest for your book
[11:03] guess what this book is free for you um
[11:05] everything what I wanted is to know that
[11:07] you want to have it you know because if
[11:09] I just said free book people download it
[11:12] they don't read it but if someone
[11:13] already had the intention okay let's see
[11:14] how much this cost you know they they
[11:16] they click that will be the second click
[11:18] on website then I believe they should
[11:20] have it and and yeah so I I for example
[11:23] on geyser fund I I actually wrote that
[11:25] it's free not at the very beginning and
[11:27] in big I wrote it like somewhere at
[11:29] three4s and the idea is that the people
[11:31] who who deserve to have it without you
[11:34] know having to pay for anything they
[11:36] they will um yeah so that that's why on
[11:39] the other hand well the fragile state
[11:42] most will never understand the whole
[11:44] idea is that the subtitle is a little
[11:46] bit controversial so some people will be
[11:48] like okay I want to know what most will
[11:50] never know and the other people is going
[11:52] to be like come on I'm not most people
[11:54] you know so it's like for for the ones
[11:55] who have a little bit of ego I hope this
[11:58] will be a little bit humbling as well
[11:59] and for the ones that have lower ego
[12:01] it's like okay it should be welcoming
[12:02] already and and yeah so there there's
[12:05] like one part in one part in the book
[12:07] where I uh explain
[12:11] that when you are pursuing change where
[12:16] you're trying to create a project of
[12:18] value, a project that is going to impact
[12:19] a lot of people. It is natural that this
[12:22] ends like in some sort of
[12:24] entrepreneurship or entrepreneurship or
[12:25] maybe you end at your favorite project
[12:27] which uh a project that has value say a
[12:30] startup which all of them are like at
[12:32] the same level of of being honorable. I
[12:35] believe like the dimension of honorable
[12:36] is like who's leading a company or
[12:38] creating it is like you know who's doing
[12:40] the things that that needs to be done
[12:42] right who is like adding world adding a
[12:45] lot of value to the world. So with that
[12:47] in mind um I attempt to explain that
[12:51] this this mindset uh is a fragile state
[12:55] and uh because most people will never
[12:58] try to build their own things. I mean
[12:59] just look at the number of entrepreneurs
[13:01] in percentage like like quite low it's
[13:03] in the one digits then it basically
[13:06] explains why most will just definitely
[13:08] never understand. So it's kind of like a
[13:09] statement but supposed to you know like
[13:12] be a little bit catchy. I don't know how
[13:13] many people read the subtitles of
[13:15] things. Uh yeah, you know that there's
[13:18] this saying that you shouldn't judge a
[13:20] book by its cover. But when I design the
[13:23] cover, I wonder why the people judge it
[13:25] by the cover. It's also interesting when
[13:27] we look at uh books because like most
[13:30] people
[13:32] um when we hear uh an author and we hear
[13:35] book title and then we also read the
[13:37] book uh like most people know the author
[13:40] then they maybe heard about the title
[13:42] and the and the subtitle. Uh and the
[13:45] number that the people that read the
[13:48] title and the subtitle is way bigger
[13:50] than the group of people that actually
[13:51] read the book. So I think that that the
[13:53] book title already has a very uh
[13:55] significant role to to to play for for
[13:59] for for someone. Um if if you want to be
[14:03] like oh like I have that book and and I
[14:05] want to convey a message. Uh so I think
[14:09] uh books like the Bitcoin standard do a
[14:11] great job in that where even if you
[14:13] don't read the full book you get the
[14:16] message already in the title like
[14:18] there's a Bitcoin standard coming. So I
[14:20] think the uh the title has a very
[14:23] essential role in to play in a book.
[14:26] Thank you. Like it's weird because when
[14:28] I think about it, this title was just
[14:31] said at the very beginning it was okay,
[14:33] it's going to be called stable
[14:35] innovation and it just it was like a
[14:37] first first try. the subtitle. Oh, that
[14:41] one that one had like 10 15 versions,
[14:45] you know, and I'm still not extremely
[14:47] happy with it, but I, you know, it was
[14:49] it it was just good enough. It's, you
[14:51] know, in a way I was thinking maybe you
[14:54] can make it less controversial, but it
[14:57] works. Yeah. And then like that and the
[14:59] focus, if you notice, is on the on the
[15:01] guy with a helmet with innovation
[15:03] helmet. So, it's kind of like it goes
[15:05] into this whole like mindset metaphor.
[15:07] Um, so it's a helmet because it's not
[15:10] like innovation like gloves or
[15:11] gauntlets. It's not innovation boots,
[15:13] innovation backpack, innovation chest
[15:15] plate. Uh, it's an innovation helmet
[15:17] because the whole idea is that you put
[15:19] it on your head because innovation
[15:21] starts and happens here. You know,
[15:23] everything else what your hands do and
[15:24] whatever is whichever command you you
[15:27] gave to your body to do whichever action
[15:29] you're already taking. But but yeah, but
[15:31] the original intention is more of a
[15:34] mindset thing. It's more of a you know
[15:36] motivation thing. you need to kind of
[15:37] like spark from the inside. I'm gonna do
[15:39] this and then yeah, then it it
[15:41] materializes. So yeah, how does this how
[15:44] does this book uh connect to to Bitcoin?
[15:47] Yeah. So okay, as a Yeah, good good
[15:50] question. So as
[15:51] a as a Bitcoiner trying to be a better
[15:54] Bitcoiner, you know, uh we have to
[15:57] responsible like you're doing the the
[15:59] the podcast. I I have to do something as
[16:04] well, right? So I've been orange
[16:05] spinning a lot of people. I believe I or
[16:07] I I I showed one person how to install
[16:11] MetaMask once and I've been trying to
[16:14] compensate for that ever since. So I
[16:17] have exactly no idea how how many people
[16:19] I orange peel but I know that in my
[16:22] presentations where I introduce people
[16:23] about Bitcoin I had over,500 people
[16:26] attending like in in in like present
[16:28] like physical right uh so I would not
[16:32] stop maybe when I have like 10,000
[16:35] people I have at least like a good two
[16:37] two to 300 confirmations of people that
[16:39] I send my Bitcoin you know and a lot of
[16:44] times I send like $5 or $3 or minimum
[16:46] $1. I don't say like one cent or
[16:48] something because I want that they have
[16:50] something that is like a a round number
[16:52] that they can see growth. Um so I might
[16:55] have given away 1/5 or 1/4 of all my
[16:58] Bitcoin just orange spitting other
[17:00] people and it is is here is crazy but it
[17:03] also feels right.
[17:05] So I had to do something as well as a
[17:08] Bitcoiner. So I decided to write a light
[17:10] book about Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is not
[17:12] the core of the book. This is not a
[17:13] Bitcoin book. If you compare it to the
[17:16] most similar thing, it will be Jeff
[17:20] Jeff's price of tomorrow. So you see,
[17:22] you're talking about what's going on in
[17:24] the world about compounding
[17:26] acceleration, which is one one argument
[17:28] that I I wanted to bring in my book. So
[17:30] I brought that one from from Jeff into
[17:31] my book as well. Uh and then yes, when
[17:34] you're about to finish a book, it's like
[17:36] okay, there's not a solution for that,
[17:38] but maybe we think about this other way,
[17:40] you know, and and there is Bitcoin and
[17:42] Bitcoin could help us with this. So
[17:44] basically has this kind of like open end
[17:47] and I wanted to do something similar. So
[17:50] that you know the last two books that I
[17:52] read apart from the price of tomorrow
[17:54] that inspired me to write this one where
[17:57] I reread animal farm from from church
[18:01] and I read one book called the lessons
[18:05] of history from from from Duran uh Duran
[18:10] and Duran. that book. Wow. It's it's
[18:13] like a very raw book and I was very
[18:16] inspired because it kind of like gives
[18:17] structure to how things work in life,
[18:19] how we humans react to many things,
[18:21] gives you a sense of of hope and
[18:23] understand progress. Uh, Animal Farm
[18:26] brought me the idea that I wanted to
[18:29] tell something easy and Price of
[18:31] Tomorrow was a book that that I enjoy a
[18:35] lot and that I wanted I wanted to just
[18:38] give a little bit more of the next steps
[18:39] to to the people. So I decided, okay,
[18:41] what if I write a book that is a little
[18:44] bit like going in the direction of price
[18:46] of tomorrow, but it's easy. So it's for
[18:47] normies, right? Number two, it builds up
[18:52] mostly from from an emotional side like
[18:54] telling real stories, not the stories of
[18:57] success because everyone writes about
[18:58] the stories of success but most mostly
[19:00] around stories of failure. And then when
[19:02] you're half of the way in the book for
[19:05] the first time, when your mind is open,
[19:06] when you're ready for change, when
[19:08] you're talking about, you know, the
[19:10] chapter five is called game theory. And
[19:12] that one is like it means that people
[19:15] usually because of different values and
[19:16] principles, they have misalignments with
[19:18] the institutions or companies that they
[19:19] work for. And this is due to weak
[19:21] incentives. Weak incentives cause money
[19:24] troubles. I basically tell people are
[19:26] very easy to put the numbers and there's
[19:28] QR codes to follow like like the sources
[19:30] and says like look for every dollar of
[19:33] value that we create in the world we
[19:34] also create three three $3 of depth you
[19:36] know I said like look at the list of um
[19:40] the list of four 30 people in the US
[19:44] there is like how much they raise well
[19:46] they have scam more more people you know
[19:49] in the valley of the mummy that was
[19:50] scammed than than how much they raised
[19:52] is absolutely crazy you know so Why are
[19:54] we focusing on this sensationalism? Why
[19:57] are we making decisions every day that
[19:59] hurt ourselves? You know, why why do we
[20:02] why do we play this game of leverage?
[20:04] So, when people are in this moment that
[20:06] it's even like make make it or break it,
[20:09] right? Like here in this chapter, it was
[20:11] maybe just too much truth at
[20:13] once. I just like don't don't don't
[20:17] continue reading a single page in the
[20:19] book or you just you're just in sync
[20:22] with me in this moment. and you say like
[20:24] wow I've been lied to you know this
[20:28] cannot be and then in this moment say
[20:30] like hey but wait you know so this is
[20:32] not a book about just like like saying
[20:34] everything is wrong this about seeing
[20:35] what's what's functioning right so and
[20:37] then I said like there's this other part
[20:40] and it's called sound incentive and then
[20:43] I said like at this moment of the book I
[20:46] will talk about a topic that not many
[20:47] agree you know it's called bitcoin I'm
[20:49] very fond of bitcoin and they said like
[20:51] look there's this is what Bitcoin is in
[20:54] this paragraph took me a lot of time to
[20:56] write and rewrite. I rewrote it like 20
[20:59] times or more. I wanted to have like
[21:01] that easiest paragraph to explain
[21:04] Bitcoin. I want to memorize it so that I
[21:07] can use those same words whenever I
[21:10] explain it to someone because it's it's
[21:12] very well structured. And then I say
[21:13] like, okay, on here there's three myths
[21:15] around Bitcoin, you know, and and I just
[21:18] try to demystify them. And it's maybe
[21:19] like two or three pages around it. And
[21:22] yeah, so the thing is that the moment
[21:23] with this comes, people are really open
[21:25] for that. I believe that anyone who
[21:27] finishes chapter five, they will
[21:30] 99.9% of something they will finish the
[21:32] book because you already has this
[21:34] momentum. And after this, I reward
[21:37] people with with the favorite chapter of
[21:39] them all, which is one called the
[21:41] unavoidables. And the unavoidables are
[21:44] those moments uh or those challenges
[21:46] that you will definitely face as an
[21:48] entrepreneur or potential innovator. And
[21:51] and because I talk mostly about like the
[21:53] biggest failures in my life,
[21:56] uh people just love it. And then you
[21:57] know like the momentum after that is is
[22:00] yeah it's just very natural. I don't I
[22:03] don't know if if there's someone out
[22:04] there that can like stop reading chapter
[22:07] seven or eight. It's it will be crazy.
[22:11] Yeah. Yeah. What what is the
[22:15] that's the relation.
[22:17] Interesting. And what do you said? uh
[22:19] the unavoidables uh of of chapter six it
[22:23] was what is that exactly? So what are
[22:26] what are what are the unavoidables? So
[22:28] the unavoidables are are three um the
[22:31] first one that that's a really cool
[22:33] question like because this this has some
[22:35] some some emotion. So the first one is
[22:38] um
[22:39] uncertainty. So when you're trying to go
[22:42] where no one else has ever gone, when
[22:45] you're trying to build something that
[22:46] never built before and there's no one to
[22:48] ask how does this work because no one
[22:50] has done it before, you will eventually
[22:53] have to face uncertainty. So you will
[22:56] not know what's going to happen next and
[22:59] this is very natural and I describe in
[23:02] the book a situation where um that was
[23:05] at the very beginning of my
[23:07] entrepreneurial journey maybe one year
[23:09] in I was showering at midnight I was
[23:12] very stressed I had to somehow get
[23:16] around 4 and a half thousand back then
[23:19] and I had five days to do it or I will
[23:22] lose my apartment I will bankrupt the
[23:24] company It was you know like just COVID
[23:28] started right before that. I was a co
[23:32] started one month after after I for the
[23:35] first time I break even. I have €50 in
[23:37] profit in the in that month you know uh
[23:41] it took me like almost half a year to
[23:42] break even before that like how I
[23:45] started my company I basically just quit
[23:46] and said like I'm going to start a
[23:47] company. It was not structured. It was
[23:49] not prepared. I didn't have customers in
[23:50] line. So that was a very humbling
[23:53] moment. So I'm there showering. I go out
[23:55] to take the towel and I just collapse,
[23:58] you know. I just collapse and start
[24:00] crying like a baby. I don't know what to
[24:01] do. Like for one maybe two minutes like
[24:04] just just crying just like crying, you
[24:07] know. There was no one there. I'm just
[24:09] crying naked in the middle of of of of
[24:12] the the floor. And yeah, I just started
[24:16] remembering some some uh methods that I
[24:19] learned on how to deal with with
[24:22] urgency, how to deal with really stress
[24:24] situations. And you know, and then I go
[24:26] and describe how I picked myself up,
[24:28] started writing like basically like
[24:30] journaling some things, writing a plan
[24:32] down and yeah, how that helped me get
[24:34] out of the problem. Obviously, because
[24:36] I'm
[24:37] here, it worked. But yeah, so that's
[24:39] number one. Number two, um I will I will
[24:42] make them a little bit shorter. Number
[24:43] two is getting stuck. So you can imagine
[24:46] that eventually uh when you start
[24:48] something you you make progress very
[24:51] fast, right? It's very exciting to start
[24:53] something new. It's like whatever you
[24:55] do, you feel that it's adding value.
[24:56] It's materializing fast. But eventually
[24:59] uh maybe the one hour that you put is
[25:01] not giving you again like 10% of getting
[25:04] better. Maybe it gives you 5% and the
[25:06] next day gives you 2% and next day gives
[25:08] you 1%. So you have this like curve of
[25:10] diminishing return before you unlock the
[25:13] next moment of divergent grow where you
[25:15] know like where you're progressing fast
[25:17] and then you go into convergence. So I
[25:18] explain this these mechanisms but the
[25:21] important thing to know is that you know
[25:24] that you should you should understand
[25:26] that those moments where you get stuck
[25:28] it means that you are already really
[25:29] starting to progress. You got to the
[25:31] point where it gets hard. you get to the
[25:33] point where if you continue you will get
[25:36] where no one else is is is getting
[25:38] because everyone else stops and says
[25:39] like okay I quit this this is too much
[25:41] for me. So that's the second one getting
[25:43] stuck. So uncertainty getting stuck and
[25:45] the third one is failure. So failure is
[25:48] just part of it. I don't believe there's
[25:50] anyone out there who can constantly like
[25:54] be successful
[25:56] um on whatever successful is here right
[25:58] without failing in the progress. So I go
[26:01] on and and tell about my biggest
[26:03] failures. I explain why. I argue that
[26:06] it's better to fail and know why you
[26:09] fail than succeed and not have the right
[26:12] reason. Even worse, like it's even more
[26:14] dangerous to think that you succeeded
[26:16] due to something else, right? Because
[26:17] when times get hard, you know, you will
[26:20] not know like the formula to to succeed
[26:23] again because you never really did in in
[26:24] a in a structure way. And why I say that
[26:28] this question is really cool is because
[26:31] on the last day that I talked with my
[26:33] grandmother and sorry like you know the
[26:34] Latin way we go like all around and then
[26:36] we come to the point right on the last
[26:37] day that I talk with my with my agita
[26:40] idea my grandma idea
[26:43] um I promised her that I was going to
[26:46] write a book I didn't say like I want to
[26:48] write a book she told me like she told
[26:49] me noto which is like little Nelson
[26:51] right like noto make a promise you will
[26:54] write a
[26:57] Um the book needs to talk about kings.
[27:00] It needs to talk a little bit about your
[27:01] life and what you have learned. And it
[27:03] needs to be about three topics. It needs
[27:06] to be about courage. It needs to be
[27:09] about perseverance and it needs to be
[27:10] love. I s I wrote if you want I can just
[27:13] send you these notes. So like the actual
[27:15] notes that I wrote they are in Spanish
[27:16] but but yeah so people can see them. But
[27:19] the crazy thing is
[27:20] that when I finished the book um for the
[27:24] first time because I spent a lot of time
[27:27] editing it, I was asking myself if I if
[27:30] if I can really like include the things
[27:34] that that my grandma told me. So I said
[27:36] like maybe I'm going to write a second
[27:37] book. I don't know. This is the first
[27:39] book. How is it possible that I promise
[27:41] something to my grandma and the very
[27:42] first book that I write, I don't keep my
[27:44] promise? That's that's crazy.
[27:46] So I already included the I mean because
[27:49] I talk about my progress in include my
[27:51] life check
[27:52] easy. There is one part in game theory
[27:55] where I where I explain in a simple and
[27:58] and visual way how inflation works. So
[28:02] this one I I use an example with with a
[28:04] king and the kingdom and you know
[28:06] there's some apples and some coins are
[28:07] minted very cheaply. Uh so okay kings we
[28:11] have it and I said like is there any way
[28:14] to
[28:15] include courage perseverance and love
[28:19] and I just said like okay I will reread
[28:21] the book so I'm reading the book and
[28:24] guess what I come to chapter
[28:26] six and it just suddenly
[28:28] clicks it was there all along I just
[28:31] need to write it when you are
[28:33] facing
[28:35] uncertainty well you you combat it you
[28:38] battle it with courage. When you get
[28:41] stuck, you battle
[28:43] it well by persevering. You know, again,
[28:47] you just have to continue even if it
[28:49] feels like it's diminishing diminishing
[28:52] progress, but you have to continuous
[28:53] because at some point you have you will
[28:55] do something that no one no one else has
[28:57] done and that's going to give you the
[28:58] competitive advantage and then you will
[29:00] progress again. And the third part is
[29:02] like to battle
[29:04] failure to you know pick yourself up
[29:07] raise from the floor stand up run jump
[29:11] on the cliff ready to try to fly again
[29:14] you really need to have passion you
[29:15] really need to have love to solve a
[29:18] problem in the world and when I noticed
[29:21] that man it's yeah like I I I just I
[29:25] just cried so I guess you
[29:27] see this was just like it was just meant
[29:30] to It was like uh serendipity, you know.
[29:34] It's like maybe my unconscious make me
[29:36] write this because I didn't think about
[29:38] these things while writing the
[29:40] structure. It was like the natural
[29:41] structure and it just let's take a break
[29:43] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[29:46] that coin vigilante has made with the
[29:49] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[29:52] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[29:55] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[29:58] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[30:00] completely new and amazing Genesis
[30:03] edition of their watch collections. You
[30:06] have the date of the first ever minded
[30:09] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[30:11] also the block height and which epoch we
[30:14] are currently in. I love the level of
[30:17] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[30:20] Make sure to check out those amazing
[30:22] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:25] descriptions. I love those watches. so
[30:28] so much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[30:31] really do hope that you don't have it on
[30:33] exchange. But if you do have it on
[30:35] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[30:37] deal with that. The first way is you put
[30:39] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[30:41] entry for you to get into the
[30:44] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[30:47] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[30:50] super simple and secure way. And if you
[30:53] check out the link in the description,
[30:55] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[30:58] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:01] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:04] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:07] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:09] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:12] that is perfect for your individual
[31:15] situation. They will show you how you
[31:18] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:20] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:22] have to keep all your devices secure.
[31:25] One topic that is overlooked often is
[31:27] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:30] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[31:33] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[31:35] place already? And last but not least,
[31:37] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[31:39] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[31:42] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[31:47] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[31:50] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:52] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:55] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:58] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:00] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:02] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:05] the link down in the description of
[32:07] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:09] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:13] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:15] there. That's beautiful. It's it's it's
[32:18] really cool. And this I think this
[32:20] chapter
[32:21] six it is kind of also related to the
[32:24] Bitcoin adoption story. I follow like oh
[32:26] like you you kind of get stuck and and
[32:28] and you and you have those failures in
[32:30] there and uh with that part of courage I
[32:34] think that that's it's almost like you I
[32:37] mean it's it's me trying to connect
[32:39] everything to Bitcoin but um if if you a
[32:43] lot of people uh after a crash or some
[32:46] correction in in Bitcoin uh they feel
[32:49] disenouraged they they sell too early
[32:51] and stuff like that. So um knowing that
[32:54] uh you you you can you have to have the
[32:57] courage to go through the good and the
[32:58] bad times in in Bitcoin is very
[33:01] important but also for like innovators
[33:03] that that actually um uh develop
[33:06] something that's that's really a a cool
[33:09] message. Is that book um describing how
[33:14] innovators do it or more of almost like
[33:17] a psych psychology help for innovators?
[33:22] How would you what is the main thing for
[33:24] that? So it's a mix of two. So chapter
[33:28] one I can just give you the essence a
[33:31] little bit without spoilers. Chapter one
[33:33] is opening chaos. It basically tells you
[33:35] you know like okay chaos is there. Chaos
[33:36] is normal. Embrace chaos. Chaos creates
[33:40] like rips in what's going on. You know
[33:42] this is this rips and challenges and
[33:44] problems. You can see them as
[33:46] opportunities. opens to chapter number
[33:49] two which is like okay when you have
[33:51] real acceleration is unmeasurable
[33:53] um you know when you have true
[33:55] innovation through acceleration you
[33:58] break the metric I give like different
[34:00] examples of that again and again and
[34:03] explain that we feel pressure today
[34:07] because of all the acceleration of the
[34:09] compounding technology so that's what's
[34:10] worrying us is pretty much so hard I
[34:12] tell people hey just narrow down focus
[34:14] on something the next thing that there's
[34:16] in chapter three moments of truth that
[34:18] will define your life and you can just
[34:21] like let these moments of truth just
[34:23] like own you or you can own them and
[34:25] whatever you decide is definitely going
[34:27] to impact you. You have to identify and
[34:29] like recognize or identify them and then
[34:31] you need to act on them you know
[34:32] consciousness say like hey which is the
[34:35] the the the version of of myself that I
[34:38] want to be you know and and you know
[34:39] that these moments are hard so usually
[34:41] you know the harder choice is usually
[34:43] the one that that helps you grow.
[34:45] Chapter four is as you say is the one
[34:48] that really helps uh people understand
[34:50] how to do things. So in a way chapter
[34:54] four yeah it's it's weird because for
[34:57] some people it has been the favorite and
[35:00] for others it's been the least favorite
[35:03] because this one is kind of like look
[35:05] these are the tools that I use. These
[35:06] are the mega trends that you should be
[35:08] paying attention on. One of them is is
[35:10] called freedom freedom and decentralized
[35:13] technologies you know like bitcoiner
[35:16] u right and and then it gives you for
[35:18] example these are the the innovator the
[35:20] most important skills for innovation
[35:22] that I found there's a graph with eight
[35:23] so this one is very practical and again
[35:26] five comebacks again theory to make
[35:28] sense of what's going on and to explain
[35:31] that we should always focus on on having
[35:35] sound incentives because this is going
[35:37] to be in the long term term is going to
[35:40] give us you know like better results u a
[35:42] better life. Number six is the
[35:44] unavoidables as we were talking. Uh
[35:47] number seven goes again and it's
[35:49] practical in in how you should make
[35:51] these decisions. Go commit or do
[35:55] nothing right? So whatever you do you
[35:59] need to do it
[36:00] intentionally. Um and number eight is
[36:04] udemonia. Um so number eight is my
[36:07] personal favorite. I mean I like most of
[36:09] the chapters actually to to be my
[36:11] favorite but I cannot I cannot have all
[36:13] my chapter in be my favorite. So I like
[36:15] all of them but the A1 is the one that I
[36:17] like the most because it it is basically
[36:19] just real like just true philosophy and
[36:21] that I inspire myself in the structure
[36:24] from the book the little book of
[36:27] stoicism by Salva.
[36:30] Um I believe he's Austrian not not sure
[36:33] German I have to check again but I I
[36:35] love that book because it really like
[36:36] visualizes and gives structure and then
[36:38] the nine the ninth chapter is just like
[36:40] spark so anyone who who reaches this
[36:43] chapter I'm basically saying look in two
[36:44] pages this is a summary this is
[36:46] everything what we learn now you are now
[36:49] you know you know like you have at the
[36:52] end of the book all the resources all
[36:53] the keys to the knowledge that I was
[36:55] speaking so you can learn it from the
[36:57] best not from me this is whom I learned
[36:59] from. So, I'm just sharing like like all
[37:02] all my my secrets, right? It's like
[37:04] these are all the tips. These are all
[37:06] the secrets. These are all the the
[37:07] sources that help me do what I do. And I
[37:10] believe they can help you too, you know?
[37:12] No, no, no secrets. And now that you
[37:18] know what's going on in the world, you
[37:19] should be responsible. Now you have the
[37:21] opportunity to be an an, you know, like
[37:24] a uh to become an agent of change. And
[37:26] it it's just so charged, just emotion.
[37:28] It's just like every word is is it's is
[37:31] purposely there just to make you take
[37:34] action just to make you know say like
[37:35] okay I will change something whatever it
[37:37] is even if it's small but I will change
[37:38] something I will start today and yeah
[37:41] and then it sums up um the book this
[37:44] mini spoiler alert so you go 10 seconds
[37:47] without it I share everyone my mantra um
[37:51] and that's like the whole book
[37:52] encapsulated in a single sentence and
[37:54] the whole message is well be the
[37:57] ordinary I build extraordinary and this
[38:01] is my mantra but in this moment I said
[38:02] like you know if I really want to live
[38:04] up to it cannot be my mantra it's also
[38:06] yours so I share it with everyone and
[38:08] the whole message is that you
[38:12] know we should always remember where we
[38:15] come from you know and we should know
[38:18] where we're going we should do it
[38:20] intentionally do it for good and we can
[38:22] stay humble in that way and still that
[38:25] doesn't mean that we cannot make
[38:27] extraordinary stuff.
[38:29] So yeah, it's a little bit of a mix of
[38:34] practical tips and so on, but anyone who
[38:38] reads reads it, they will understand
[38:40] that there's no trick, there's no
[38:42] shortcut or like easy tips or something
[38:45] like 10 steps to innovation. It's just
[38:47] all about knowing what you want to do
[38:50] like having a very a very clear
[38:54] north committing to that path and do it
[38:57] in long enough you know was saying at
[39:01] the same time no to all distractions
[39:03] you're saying I'm focusing on this and
[39:04] doing it long enough until you actually
[39:06] succeed in what you want to do until you
[39:08] actually solve the problem. So that's
[39:10] what the book is about. And yeah, as I
[39:14] said at the beginning, I wrote it
[39:15] because I believe that it will really
[39:17] give a chance to anyone who read it to
[39:20] structure their
[39:22] life. And in a way, I
[39:24] also plan it so that if any
[39:28] Bitcoiner wants to orange peel their
[39:31] loved ones, they can do it this way. So
[39:34] I mean, there's a little hint. There's a
[39:35] little Bitcoin logo on the on the front
[39:37] cover and there's a little N logo N logo
[39:40] on the window. But but yeah, so it's
[39:42] it's sub, right? So when you give
[39:45] someone a book about Bitcoin, it's like
[39:47] look, I want you to learn about
[39:48] Bitcoin. And I bought the the little
[39:51] Bitcoin book, by the way. I met Jimmy
[39:52] Song and we made a book. So we signed
[39:54] this book. That was special moment. But
[39:56] I bought that book over 30 times. It was
[39:58] my goal to give to everyone that I love.
[40:00] But I noticed that maybe half of the
[40:02] people didn't read it because it's like
[40:04] I'm telling like you should learn about
[40:06] Bitcoin and they are not and they are
[40:08] not ready for that. So I said I want to
[40:12] to to have this book that is that is
[40:14] easy that is for normals that it has
[40:15] some interesting stories real stories
[40:18] that has this philosophy without saying
[40:20] that is philosophy but it's like apply
[40:22] philosophy to the everyday life all the
[40:24] time. So that is interesting and and at
[40:28] the end you know uh helps introduce like
[40:31] our loved ones for all Bitcoiners
[40:33] friends you know helps introduce them to
[40:36] to principles of of philosophy you know
[40:38] to low time
[40:39] preference to understand that you know
[40:43] hard work is needed to understand that
[40:45] there's some things out there in the
[40:46] world that we need to rethink because
[40:49] they are not as they seem to be and we
[40:51] already have the symptoms there and that
[40:53] they should be open to to different
[40:55] topics uh such as open innovation and
[40:58] then you know say like okay look at
[41:00] blender look at
[41:01] Linux look at Bitcoin you know and yeah
[41:05] so that's that's what the book is about.
[41:08] Sorry it went very long but with this
[41:09] answer but you know it's like yeah
[41:11] that's the thing is with this topic I
[41:13] cannot stop Rob. Hey I love it. I love
[41:16] it and and there's so there's so much
[41:18] stuff in there um that we can get in
[41:20] there. Maybe a little bit on uh on on on
[41:24] Bitcoin uh because you write so much
[41:26] about innovation. How how extraordinary
[41:29] is Bitcoin when you compare it to other
[41:32] innovations?
[41:33] Well, I made the argument I mean so I I
[41:38] argue once in the book that
[41:41] Bitcoin is when it's from fun
[41:44] fundamentals is the the biggest
[41:46] innovation project in the world. If you
[41:48] think about
[41:49] technology and I really start checking
[41:52] into numbers how many people are running
[41:53] no this stuff then the Linux operating
[41:56] systems is the biggest one but
[41:58] fundamentally
[41:59] uh when it comes about really making a
[42:01] dent and trying to to steer the
[42:04] direction where things are
[42:06] going hopefully in what can be a way
[42:10] nicer direction more sound direction in
[42:13] that sense I believe Bitcoin is
[42:16] extraordinary in the entire sense of in
[42:19] the entire sense of of of the word and
[42:22] what's extraordinary is because it's
[42:24] extraordinarily transparent.
[42:27] uh is extraordinarily complex but when
[42:30] you understand it at the same time the
[42:32] rules are extraordinarily
[42:34] simple and yeah
[42:37] so very much like I guess most people
[42:41] hear in this once you once you dedicate
[42:45] enough time there there's no stop it's
[42:47] just like wonder after wonder you know
[42:52] yeah it's it's it's it's incredible it's
[42:55] it's incredible you you must know,
[42:57] right? Like you go into conversations
[42:58] with other people and yeah, I'm I'm more
[43:00] calm now. I don't talk too much about
[43:03] Bitcoin unless I really think like,
[43:05] okay, maybe it should go into this way.
[43:08] And the best thing is like when
[43:10] you lead a conversation where someone
[43:13] eventually will say like, okay, look,
[43:15] I'm talking about this. What about this
[43:16] Bitcoin bitcoins? What are these
[43:18] bitcoins? So you you mention sometimes,
[43:20] right? And then you go there. But I
[43:22] believe it's is extraordinary in every
[43:24] way. And in chapter
[43:27] 8
[43:29] I and this is the other part that has
[43:31] around me. I describe that I believe
[43:33] that Satoshi
[43:35] uh lives
[43:38] live with all the principles of of
[43:41] udemonia you know uh so like Satoshi is
[43:45] my udemonia example you know living with
[43:48] virtue focusing on what he or she or
[43:51] they will control. I mean there's
[43:53] different theories like you know I
[43:54] believe Satoshi is is already you know
[43:57] like like we don't we don't have we
[43:59] don't have him with us that's what I
[44:01] believe uh but yeah but yeah and then
[44:05] the the the other part is taking
[44:06] responsibility so I really believe that
[44:08] Satoshi lives up to the entire hype of
[44:10] of what you know like yeah
[44:14] means
[44:16] and I believe that due to all these
[44:19] things and how everyone comes together.
[44:22] Bitcoin is just extraordinary in every
[44:24] sense. It's a lot of bunch of whole
[44:26] bunch of ordinary things, right? It's
[44:28] ordinary people doing ordinary things
[44:31] for an extremely like for an
[44:33] extraordinary amount of time and with
[44:35] extraordinary perseverance. Yeah. And
[44:38] that makes Bitcoin not extraordinary at
[44:40] all. That's cool. I like that. Is would
[44:43] you say that Bitcoin is in innovatable?
[44:47] is is Bitcoin the adoption uh and the
[44:50] game theory aspect makes it so good that
[44:54] you it's it's it's kind of getting
[44:57] adopted anyways. Well, I mean, here is
[45:00] here is where it where it gets
[45:02] interesting, right? I believe for
[45:04] adoption to happen, uh, I mean, some
[45:07] very hard Bitcoiners, and if I learned
[45:09] something in the past months is that not
[45:10] all Bitcoiners are made the same.
[45:12] Unfortunately, there's a lot of people
[45:14] that are very proud about Bitcoin, but
[45:16] they are still like living in the fiat
[45:18] mindset. But for the ones who do uh I
[45:21] believe that for the ones that that are
[45:23] really sound I believe that that that we
[45:25] all understand that we also need to to
[45:28] cooperate. We don't with companies we
[45:30] need to cooperate with governments. So I
[45:33] believe when someone calls any Bitcoiner
[45:36] a true Bitcoiner an
[45:37] anarchist that's wrong. They're not
[45:40] anarchist. It's not like yeah we want no
[45:42] no rules or nothing. No, like Bitcoin is
[45:44] the opposite of anarchist is an
[45:47] indestruct indestructible system, you
[45:50] know. So, we want rules, we want system.
[45:51] What we want is just better rules,
[45:53] transparent rules, rules that that that
[45:56] that you know, like that are fair to
[45:58] everyone and so on. So I believe that
[46:02] yes, Bitcoin can really help us innovate
[46:05] a lot of things. But for that to happen,
[46:08] we have to be also a little bit more
[46:10] open and humble to
[46:14] understand that even through we might
[46:17] understand the problems that most people
[46:19] and like are dealing with, we still need
[46:21] to approach it more from the emotional
[46:23] side, right? Uh like yeah my my father
[46:28] when I was trying to explain him Bitcoin
[46:30] he's like I thought you how to use the
[46:32] spoon what are you going to teach me
[46:34] right um so yeah in these moments you
[46:38] have to be humble and kind of say like
[46:40] hey look it's just I'm trying to share
[46:42] what what I learned so far and I believe
[46:44] it's really interesting so it's not
[46:46] absolute I want to know what you think
[46:48] about it you know uh when you talk with
[46:51] with someone in the government uh and
[46:53] you introduce Bitcoin you have to like
[46:55] look um you think that's Bitcoin as some
[46:59] way for people to do illicit activities
[47:01] you know like illegal stuff uh avoid
[47:04] taxes and so on build the right
[47:06] incentives and you can have a tax system
[47:09] that is faster where you can allow
[47:11] people to just like pay Bitcoin like
[47:14] almost instantly uh that's going to make
[47:16] the cash better for the entire country
[47:18] you know but you want to you want to
[47:21] plan for it you want to go and and and
[47:23] and and you want to go and and and and
[47:26] talk with beaconers and see what they
[47:28] think, you know, what works and so on.
[47:30] So like both sides need to be willing to
[47:32] commit. So yeah, nothing is like like
[47:37] black or white. There's like infinite
[47:40] shades of gray. And with that in mind,
[47:43] if we want more adoption and if we want
[47:44] more Bitcoin innovation, we need we need
[47:47] to be willing to compromise on some
[47:49] things. Maybe it's the
[47:51] timing. Uh maybe it's, you know, okay,
[47:55] agreeing to some regulations that don't
[47:57] change change anything Bitcoin. It's
[47:59] just changes how some some ways of how
[48:01] we use Bitcoin change. Uh or we are not
[48:06] supposed to be willing to change at all
[48:07] is our principles of values, you know,
[48:09] like the ones that that that made us
[48:12] every single day love Bitcoin. So yeah,
[48:15] when we can be humble enough to approach
[48:18] it that way, I believe we're ready for
[48:19] for for more innovation and and
[48:22] adoption. Really cool. It I also one one
[48:26] thing I remember now you said I think
[48:27] this it's it's super beautiful. Um it's
[48:30] that the natural state is is chaos kind
[48:33] of like we we we always try to make
[48:36] structure and like bring like nice
[48:39] things to to to uh to the world. you
[48:43] lived in
[48:44] Germany there. There it's even more than
[48:46] probably like in in El Salvador where
[48:48] people always try to make very good
[48:51] structures and try to to sort everything
[48:54] out. Uh but the world is actually quite
[48:56] chaotic and and I think that's good like
[48:58] the natural state uh is is chaotic and
[49:01] ups and downs and volatility is actually
[49:04] something good like volatility is
[49:06] vitality. I like that a lot. Um of a
[49:10] saying of like we we want volatility, we
[49:13] want vitality, we want chaos. Uh and not
[49:18] everything is going in in a straight
[49:20] line and and going good like you have
[49:22] good years, you have bad years, you have
[49:23] crashes, you have booms. Uh and those
[49:26] things are those those things are good
[49:28] and and I think in a Bitcoin world, we
[49:30] will have that that truth more. And and
[49:34] that's also something you you talked
[49:35] about which I think really I I think is
[49:38] really really cool to to to see how you
[49:41] describe it also. Well I mean if you
[49:44] look at nature
[49:46] nature creates a lot of chaos. You go to
[49:49] jungle right it's beautiful. Uh you put
[49:52] your cables in your
[49:54] backpack, you know, all of them really
[49:57] nice, you know, like each of them like
[49:58] like a line and so on on a space. You
[50:01] shake it, open it up again after a few
[50:03] minutes, they are all in tangle, right?
[50:05] It's like this mad mad disturbing
[50:07] things. And that's beautiful, too. Every
[50:10] single day we wake up into this world
[50:14] that we don't fully understand. We're
[50:16] far away from fully understanding it. I
[50:18] have no idea. You know if I say that we
[50:20] understand 0.01% of our world are most
[50:24] likely wrong you know because the more
[50:27] we learn what was changing. No it's
[50:29] 0.00001. I know it's
[50:33] 0.00001% right. I believe that's the
[50:35] beautiful thing. Now a lot of people
[50:37] when you apply this to volatility they
[50:39] cannot deal with
[50:40] volatility. Um yeah it's maybe just too
[50:44] wild. I like volatility because that's
[50:47] that's what what keeps you
[50:50] humble, right? So, I don't know if at
[50:53] some point uh the volatility from
[50:55] Bitcoin is just decreasing and it loses
[50:58] that that positive effect
[51:01] uh you know, but yeah, but if you think
[51:04] around again about life, volatility is
[51:06] what what makes life good. you know
[51:08] there's no there's no really cool
[51:11] enjoyable moment without a really sad
[51:15] depressing moment you know so you have
[51:17] to go through the hard times so that you
[51:18] can enjoy the good times so productivity
[51:20] is everywhere
[51:23] and yeah when when I have to explain
[51:26] this you know in a more structured way
[51:28] to people because we're trying to find
[51:30] and create structures for this world
[51:32] that we don't fully understand all the
[51:34] time we we just like assume a lot of
[51:36] things uh I go and explain people it's
[51:39] like hey look it's just like it's like a
[51:40] baby it's a baby currency um as people
[51:43] are adopting it you know you know all
[51:47] these like higher number of people in
[51:50] this array of offers you know people
[51:52] selling for more selling for less buying
[51:54] for more buying for less is going to
[51:56] make this volatility go away I mean it's
[51:59] it's it's just a way
[52:02] but yeah that's the thing is that this
[52:04] is such a personal thing you know like
[52:06] understanding Then volatility goes
[52:09] beyond understanding finances and you
[52:11] know like basic trading economics and so
[52:13] on. It's it's more about understanding
[52:17] yourself and seeing
[52:20] if well it's seeing like what what's the
[52:23] way how you react to things changing
[52:25] that you cannot control.
[52:28] So yeah I don't know if I answered that
[52:31] question. I mean yeah it's definitely
[52:33] interesting um of of the thing. I mean I
[52:37] I think here I didn't even ask a
[52:38] questions but yeah it it was it is
[52:43] definitely but but it is something
[52:46] interesting with with the natural state
[52:48] of um of of Bitcoin. Um how do you
[52:52] actually see uh the the role that
[52:54] Bitcoin is playing in in the world right
[52:56] now? uh we we see that uh it's getting
[52:59] more and more adopted by individuals of
[53:01] course but uh in recent years it's more
[53:04] about uh institutions and actually also
[53:07] nation states adopting Bitcoin. Um how
[53:10] do you see Bitcoin's role currently in
[53:12] in the world? So I cannot talk about the
[53:15] world I feel I mean don't be wrong every
[53:18] place is so different. I travel a bunch
[53:22] maybe thanks to that I work for an
[53:24] airline as I said before for some time
[53:26] so I could travel very cheap and I did
[53:28] some volunteering here and there like in
[53:30] India uh for a few months
[53:33] um so I cannot really like talk for the
[53:36] world uh I can talk for the countries
[53:40] where where I live the most which are
[53:43] Germany and El Salvador to focus on
[53:46] those I don't want to say anything
[53:48] that's totally far from reality. So in
[53:52] Germany, if you ask
[53:55] me, for Bitcoin to to to play a major
[53:58] role in Germany, like at an
[53:59] institutional level, it's just a
[54:03] topic of being
[54:05] humble. That's the biggest hurdle. No,
[54:08] you have all these people sitting like
[54:10] how how do people the in German I heard
[54:12] one the ayakov central because you know
[54:15] like this this building has like central
[54:18] means like the the in English how is
[54:20] like the the central or like the
[54:24] building of the people with with egg
[54:26] heads but this does this this building
[54:28] has like some sort of like like sphere
[54:31] looking like a head in the middle but
[54:33] yeah you have all these people just that
[54:35] take themselves very very seriously. I
[54:37] met I met the past ministry of education
[54:40] before before she became the the
[54:42] ministry of education. She came to my
[54:45] office unannounced just comes in and you
[54:48] know she's like oh this office looks
[54:50] really cool. She used the just the
[54:52] moment to make some really cool
[54:54] innovating pictures shaking the hat of
[54:57] a white looking foreigner from a very
[55:00] poor country. Uh use it everywhere on
[55:03] her Facebook never talk again you know.
[55:05] So you have all these people is like
[55:08] that are there with their very personal
[55:10] agendas very
[55:12] egocentric and they don't want to be
[55:16] told that there's a better way like they
[55:18] they know the better way of that's how
[55:20] how they think. So I believe in Germany
[55:23] uh beacon can can play a role of of
[55:27] humbling again know down the people if
[55:32] you see it the biggest institutions that
[55:34] from Germany that are going and help out
[55:36] there um I'm not going to say names but
[55:40] you know they go to other countries and
[55:42] say like oh you do wrong this is the way
[55:45] and it's like ah you're doing this 999
[55:48] here this is how you do it you know it's
[55:50] And the reality is is totally different
[55:54] you know you cannot apply those things
[55:55] you you just break the entire in
[55:57] incentive system so yeah I believe
[56:00] that's the role that it can play as you
[56:02] see with the recent decisions this is
[56:04] like someone who created a page
[56:05] something like Germany not going to make
[56:07] it or something I forgot the name you
[56:09] know showing like what will be the price
[56:11] of of the like it was 50,000 lickons
[56:14] right that is so yeah so I I don't know
[56:18] I don't know I don't know about Germany
[56:20] Um, I believe Germany has to go through
[56:24] a little bit harder times until it goes
[56:26] back up again. Uh, maybe there's some
[56:28] chances there
[56:30] like I don't see is going in the right
[56:33] direction now. Maybe in five, seven
[56:34] years is a chance for for correction.
[56:37] Maybe I I rejoin Germany for for some
[56:39] time. Maybe I like reopen companies
[56:42] there again. But for now, I focus on
[56:44] Oavador. And the role in Osavo here is a
[56:47] little bit more exciting.
[56:49] First is more exciting
[56:51] because most people don't have access to
[56:53] banks, you know, maybe you are a very
[56:56] imagine why you're a very poor person.
[56:59] Um you have your son or daughter, right?
[57:02] Like they they are born in your house.
[57:05] Um maybe you didn't manage you didn't
[57:08] have the 10 bucks or 30 bucks to pay for
[57:10] the papers that you have a son or
[57:12] daughter. So they they don't have a
[57:16] document, an ID. Therefore, their sons
[57:19] like they their sons or daughters kind
[57:21] of have ID and so on. So, they're kind
[57:23] of like out of the system and the bank
[57:25] is like first thing is show me your ID.
[57:27] Okay. Ah, that's weird. Okay. Show me
[57:29] your mother's ID. Okay. I want to have
[57:30] the social security number. What do you
[57:32] mean you don't have this or all of these
[57:33] things? So I believe that here uh the
[57:38] biggest role that
[57:40] Bitcoin can serve people is that when
[57:44] you allow them to understand them, you
[57:47] also have the opportunity to give them
[57:50] very basic but very very basic financial
[57:56] education. You know just a like a ratio
[57:59] of how much they should try to save or
[58:01] something whatever a tiny conversation.
[58:03] What are your higher costs, you know,
[58:05] how can you reduce them so that it that
[58:07] it's more, you know, like if you get
[58:09] $10, you know, can you put $1 aside,
[58:11] keep it in Bitcoin? So, I believe that
[58:14] if you just orange peel people like
[58:15] orange and you just explain like, "Oh,
[58:17] look, this is Bitcoin and you can run on
[58:19] this like super light orange peel, you
[58:21] make them um a disfavor." So, you're not
[58:23] you're not doing something good for
[58:25] them, you know? you just increase the
[58:29] resistance next time that they try
[58:30] Bitcoin because now they tried and they
[58:32] did it the wrong way. Um, so explaining
[58:36] a little bit of of let's say like in the
[58:38] future what I would like to try to do
[58:41] here in El Salvador and this you can
[58:42] apply to other developing countries and
[58:44] eventually the more developed ones and
[58:45] this is like the bigger role thinking
[58:46] about game theory as a whole. Um I
[58:50] believe that it's possible to create a
[58:52] platform and this platform is filled
[58:55] with two things. One is tasks that an
[59:00] institution, a government or eventually
[59:01] a company wants someone else to do. They
[59:04] could be like okay uh join this event
[59:07] about picking trash, make a picture
[59:09] there, get a post from the leader,
[59:12] upload evidence here on the platform,
[59:15] you get 15 US, right?
[59:18] And the second thing is that that all
[59:21] these institutions whatever this the
[59:22] this activities can be you can pay
[59:24] someone to learn you can pay someone to
[59:26] participate to contribute to create
[59:28] content to uh join an event whatever all
[59:31] these tasks right you also need to put
[59:33] some budget in so you you put some some
[59:35] some US dollars now the problem is that
[59:39] okay now you have a platform with task
[59:41] for the for for the people but but and
[59:44] the money but you don't have a way to to
[59:46] approach and pay them. It gets crazy
[59:49] here because if you want to to do do
[59:51] bank bankrupt sanctions, okay, boom, you
[59:52] already lost 70% of the people, right?
[59:55] And the people who who need it the most
[59:57] and who can who are already like in all
[59:59] these places and can engage and
[60:01] contribute and participate and and clean
[60:03] and reorder and
[60:04] build, you are just like dismissing,
[60:07] right? Also, just like uh every bank is
[60:10] going to charge something, you cannot
[60:11] send someone $5 because the transaction
[60:14] cost is too high.
[60:16] um you know what if someone from
[60:17] Guatemala wants to participate that's no
[60:19] longer $5 maybe it's 20 you know what if
[60:21] someone kind of add value from the other
[60:23] side of the world now the transaction is
[60:25] $150 and it's going to take more than a
[60:27] week and maybe it's going to get frozen
[60:30] so bitcoin comes into play you know or
[60:34] at least you know like like something
[60:36] based on bitcoin you know even uh if
[60:39] people want to get stable ss and so on
[60:42] you know like based on live network
[60:44] whatever something that is yeah this
[60:46] could be or if the platform requires
[60:48] anonymity for some reason for example
[60:51] you could do this for people uh to help
[60:54] them train in how to in the see
[60:57] illegally visit activities how to report
[60:59] for example human trafficking or drug
[61:01] trafficking or something like this and
[61:03] then you know you can use like eash so
[61:05] that you can make you know this
[61:06] anonymous payments to these people so
[61:08] that you don't put them in danger if you
[61:09] have like a database and someone hacks
[61:10] it then you know like the gangsters and
[61:12] here we had problems with gangsters a
[61:14] lot of times And they have like a a
[61:15] database on whom to kill, you know, and
[61:17] now their problems are gone because
[61:19] there are no no one else is going to
[61:21] whisper to to to the to the authorities,
[61:24] you know, who's doing wrong. But yeah,
[61:26] but now you have this platform, you have
[61:27] activities, you have budget, you have a
[61:29] way to distribute to everyone. You you
[61:31] pay them in SAS. So people come in and
[61:34] they can see all these all these
[61:35] activities and because the world is
[61:38] moving in certain trends and certain
[61:39] direction, the world is moving into gig
[61:42] economy, you know. So it's a little bit
[61:45] a symptom I will say like a symptom of
[61:47] of of the of the yeah problems in global
[61:50] finance right the system of uh sorry a
[61:52] symptom of the monetary system because
[61:54] people because of that people also need
[61:56] like a source B of income just a tiny
[61:58] bit more just to keep up with inflation
[62:01] because we have basically as a
[62:04] generation almost aated our in dopamine
[62:09] our incentive system inside you know
[62:12] with all it's Tik Tok and and and then
[62:14] Instagram scrolling just like destroying
[62:17] our incessant systems again are
[62:19] destroying our brains. We need to focus
[62:21] again on shorter things you know that
[62:23] that that pay faster and yeah and even
[62:28] more people even if if if people are are
[62:30] are poor they still save up and they buy
[62:33] even with credit a smartphone. So I feel
[62:35] that all these threats are pointing out
[62:37] that this is a system how you can
[62:39] re-engage like people activate them and
[62:42] put them on a path to give them proper
[62:44] education including this financial
[62:46] education including education about that
[62:48] makes them you know like be able to do
[62:50] their own agriculture or get a job or
[62:54] start their own company right and you
[62:56] are paying for that and the budget is
[62:58] already there it comes from come from
[62:59] the taxes so yeah then you
[63:03] So all the submissions that people do,
[63:06] documents, links, videos, posts, shares,
[63:10] whatever they do,
[63:12] articles, analyzes, research, someone
[63:15] checks it, they give it, okay, yes, this
[63:18] has been properly done or no, or they
[63:21] just give you like five stars, one
[63:23] stars, whatever. Once they do this, the
[63:25] rewards are instantly unlocked and then
[63:27] boom, it's like here are your SS, you
[63:29] know. So if you see I call this the
[63:31] centralized engagement and if you see is
[63:34] what I'm trying to do is to create the
[63:36] right balance of
[63:39] incentives so that the governmental
[63:41] institutions wants to wants to use this
[63:44] goal for their own goals because every
[63:46] activity every participation of every
[63:48] citizen makes them a more exemplary
[63:51] citizen and helps achieve the goals of
[63:53] the government which helps achieve like
[63:54] a a higher let me say like it's looks
[63:57] they are doing good things therefore
[63:59] they get again
[64:01] like voted for, you know, so they can
[64:04] stay in power. And then to the people,
[64:07] you give something that always has value
[64:09] to them. You're always giving them
[64:10] knowledge. You're always giving them
[64:11] something something to do. You give them
[64:13] purpose and you pay them with the
[64:17] hardest money in the world that we have.
[64:21] So yeah, I believe like that is the role
[64:24] that Bitcoin can have. it can allow mass
[64:28] participation of people in the country.
[64:31] So it's like
[64:32] uh maybe a better implementation of a
[64:36] party participative
[64:38] democracy and it here is very
[64:41] utopian but I believe that in 15 maybe
[64:44] 20 years there's no government that will
[64:47] not be trying to use this tool and those
[64:50] are the things that that my partner and
[64:54] I are focusing on thinking okay maybe we
[64:56] can maybe we can build this or if not
[65:00] you know like uh help create this type
[65:02] of systems and if not at least create
[65:06] the right incentives you know in some
[65:08] other way but when we talk about Bitcoin
[65:13] specifically that's the role that you
[65:14] can have it you can
[65:16] just help like awake everyone and
[65:19] reactivate them you know and help them
[65:23] participate and and make change instead
[65:25] of sitting on the couch watching some
[65:28] nonsense consuming some high
[65:31] fructose juice with
[65:33] some heavy heavy metal, you know, like
[65:37] you do sandwich or whatever and yeah,
[65:40] just like send up and then let something
[65:42] do something of value. Okay, you don't
[65:44] like this, you can change it and you're
[65:45] going to get paid for. That's the big
[65:48] role almost a a democratic revolution uh
[65:51] which which Bitcoin uh could be
[65:54] especially also because then uh right
[65:57] now we don't have a say in what the
[66:00] money supply is and if everyone uses
[66:02] Bitcoin everyone has a say actually in
[66:04] in in in the monetary system or can have
[66:07] a say with with Bitcoin. It's a really
[66:09] interesting really interesting
[66:11] perspective here. For me this is you
[66:14] know so I'm focusing on on topics I have
[66:17] an innovation agency and I focus on
[66:18] topics are on education workshops to
[66:20] solve problems you know so this kind of
[66:22] like like trainings and so on and the
[66:25] whole other part like the other part
[66:28] that that is kind of like the tool that
[66:30] that will empower us to do this and just
[66:32] take it to the next level and scale it
[66:34] up is is thinking in in this massive
[66:37] participation you know um yeah why why
[66:41] is become so extraordinary again is
[66:45] because there's thousands and thousands
[66:48] and thousands of us aligned by
[66:50] incentives participating and
[66:52] contributing to this system.
[66:54] So I am just realizing right now that in
[66:57] a way this system is inspired by
[66:59] Bitcoin. You know I never thought about
[67:01] it. I was seeing that Bitcoin is kind of
[67:03] like part of the puzzle but it's not
[67:05] only part of the puzzle. It's maybe the
[67:07] the
[67:08] source. Crazy. I just notic this right
[67:11] now. Look what you said. There you go.
[67:14] The next book is coming. Oh my
[67:18] god. uh first build you know like well
[67:22] first understand everywhere still in
[67:24] that place. Yeah. Then we will optimize
[67:28] then we'll automate then we will scale
[67:30] then write the book
[67:33] of years but who knows you know like
[67:35] future is so
[67:36] uncertain and that's daunting but at the
[67:39] same time exhausting exhausting exciting
[67:41] exhausting not exciting it can be
[67:43] exhausting too but more exciting than
[67:44] anything else. So yeah let's see. Really
[67:48] cool. Um there's one question to ask
[67:49] each and every one of my guests and the
[67:51] question is what can we learn from you
[67:53] besides Bitcoin? Uh be like besides
[67:56] Bitcoin well he's a humble servant and I
[68:00] am doing a lot of mistakes and I try to
[68:03] share them.
[68:06] So this is the most important thing that
[68:08] I can that I can at least attempt or try
[68:11] to teach anyone else is that is because
[68:13] I have been humble in life so many
[68:15] times. I lost everything in my life
[68:17] three times including including last
[68:20] year building something similar to to
[68:23] what I was describing before just with
[68:25] the absolute total grow incentive. Uh I
[68:28] met the wrong person and then I I met
[68:31] another person who was a really cool
[68:33] person and together we started a company
[68:34] and and I said like I can design this
[68:37] like what I was describing before like
[68:39] everything what I want is to have a
[68:41] Bitcoin only version of it. uh you know
[68:44] and have it as a separate entity but
[68:46] these people want to go crypto. I went
[68:49] there, I designed the thing, help it
[68:52] grow because it was based on crypto
[68:54] stuff, you know, with the wrong
[68:56] incentives. Whatever you build is going
[68:58] to crush, you know, building like a sand
[69:01] castle next to next to the beach and and
[69:05] it's very close to the water and you and
[69:07] you build it when the when the tie is
[69:08] low. So, you know that eventually the
[69:11] tie is going to go high and it's going
[69:13] to erase your sand castle and any
[69:16] evidence of existence. So that's that's
[69:18] what week incentives does.
[69:21] So yeah, if I will take something from
[69:25] all these something moments is that you
[69:27] should should really like take your
[69:28] time, you know, don't try to rush.
[69:31] Gather some skills like and put some
[69:34] time into them. Put 40 hours, 100 hours,
[69:36] 200 hours, 500 hours into into
[69:38] perfecting them. Thousands of hours if
[69:40] you
[69:41] can. Then really ask yourself, what are
[69:44] the problems that really bother you the
[69:46] most? say no to everything else because
[69:48] saying yes is easy is automatic but
[69:50] saying no this is a phrase from Adam was
[69:52] the editor of the book and and and my
[69:54] favorite phrase in the book is that that
[69:56] saying no is intentional you know no
[69:58] saying no to everything allows you to
[70:01] say yes to the things that matter. So
[70:02] once you focus down that thing that that
[70:04] these problems the things that bother
[70:06] you and you can say yes to them because
[70:07] you're saying no to everything
[70:09] else just like very slowly move and
[70:12] stick to it. So I lost all my savings. I
[70:16] went into even into that into I just I
[70:18] just have recovered back from now. I'm
[70:20] starting like basically from zero in
[70:21] terms of like of like what I'm saving
[70:24] like my Bitcoin is the only thing that
[70:27] that that I have because now I found a
[70:30] boat a voting accident, right? But
[70:34] um but yeah, it's
[70:37] just try to describe all of this. It
[70:39] means like don't don't rush, you know,
[70:41] if you really and this is something that
[70:44] is still something that I'm learning and
[70:46] I'm repeating it so that I'm sure that
[70:47] really learn it fully. It's difficult.
[70:49] It's not it's even if if if you hear it
[70:51] 10,000 times, it doesn't mean that you
[70:53] learn it. But I'm starting to understand
[70:56] that
[70:56] I'm that whatever I can do is more worth
[70:59] than like Bitcoin. And that if I do it
[71:02] really good enough, if I do it trying to
[71:05] absolutely excel every day, trying to be
[71:08] very very constant, you know, go
[71:10] positive, go
[71:12] first, do it constant, doing it every
[71:14] day, just trying to improve, you know,
[71:16] whatever amount of Bitcoin I have, I
[71:18] might I will have more Bitcoin later.
[71:20] But if I if I or all of us try to rush
[71:23] into getting more Bitcoin, that will
[71:25] help us do the opposite of what we try
[71:28] to learn. that will help us that that
[71:29] will raise our ego that will help us
[71:32] make more mistakes. You know, we will
[71:34] start looking for quantity instead of
[71:36] quality. But we will get into noise
[71:39] instead of finding calmness and the
[71:41] signal. And when we're trying to rush
[71:43] and be too fast instead of going slow is
[71:45] when we make the mistakes. And those
[71:46] mistakes are humbling again. And they
[71:47] can realign us back into the into the
[71:50] sounder path. But yeah, I know that I'm
[71:53] saying that and I say like you still got
[71:56] to do your thing, right? I mean this is
[71:58] not that you will not make that mistake,
[72:00] you will still do it. But my hope is
[72:03] that by saying this when you do it, it
[72:06] will give you structure to what happened
[72:08] and what can happen next. You know this
[72:10] will be your next moment of truth. So
[72:12] goodbye. Sorry I have here some friends.
[72:15] Yeah. So that is that is that is what I
[72:18] what I can teach others and that's why
[72:20] why I wrote the book. everything else
[72:22] you know like if someone is looking if
[72:24] someone has a company and if stuff is
[72:26] dealing with anything of the problems
[72:28] that I was talking about just please get
[72:30] in contact with me and then we can see
[72:32] if there's a match you know I really
[72:34] take my time now to see whether there's
[72:35] a match if we're not a good match I
[72:38] suggest someone else who can also do a
[72:40] pretty good job that maybe better
[72:42] alliance but yeah so in our lives like
[72:46] we decide like where our boat is going
[72:49] if we want to and who's coming with us
[72:52] and who's going to do what in the so I
[72:55] learned that if you choose the wrong
[72:57] incentives or sometimes the wrong
[72:59] partners with the wrong incentives is
[73:01] going to drag you down heavy. So I had
[73:03] this three times in life and I don't
[73:05] want to do I don't want to deal with
[73:06] this again and maybe I will I hope but
[73:10] definitely not in the magnitude or not
[73:12] in the way you know that that it
[73:13] happened before.
[73:15] So I know that you didn't ask me but in
[73:18] a
[73:19] way this is what finalized my orange
[73:22] spinning conversion you know this is
[73:24] what what what was like a claims you
[73:26] know this is what got me
[73:28] from focusing on nonsense into saying
[73:32] okay beacon beacon noise that's a that's
[73:36] a important thing of like find finding
[73:38] that signal in in in so much noise that
[73:41] we that we have and we have a end in the
[73:44] podcast where the the previous guest is
[73:46] asking a question for the next guest
[73:47] without knowing who the next guest is.
[73:49] I'm really interested in in what you
[73:51] have to say to that one. Um, what is
[73:53] your most controversial opinion that you
[73:56] have on Bitcoin which you think most of
[73:59] the Bitcoin community would disagree
[74:00] with?
[74:04] Ah, that's an incredible question. Oh,
[74:07] the most controversial thing. So I I
[74:09] okay I thought that that for a lot of
[74:11] Bitcoiners I said already two I will
[74:14] repeat them and see if there's something
[74:16] even stronger than that. One is that
[74:19] that we need to be even more humble and
[74:21] more willing to you know like to find
[74:24] what's like the
[74:25] compromise. That's one. The second one
[74:27] is that not all Bitcoiners are made the
[74:29] same. That's another one.
[74:32] Well and third
[74:34] is Yeah. I mean here I'm going to split
[74:37] people into you know beacon vicers will
[74:40] agree with me and whoever else doesn't
[74:43] agree with me you're not a beaconer I
[74:44] will say that but is that we're not
[74:48] always
[74:49] right and Boner is not
[74:52] perfect there is a good
[74:55] five five things that are dangerous to
[74:59] Bitcoin that we should be aware of and
[75:01] when we're aware we can work on them I I
[75:04] spent some time I I had the luxury of
[75:08] sitting 4 hours straight in a group of
[75:10] 15 people in a castle in Germany in the
[75:14] in the basement of the castle, you know,
[75:17] with a core Bitcoin
[75:19] developer and then with other like
[75:22] people that are really adding a lot of
[75:24] value to Bitcoin just to talk about
[75:25] what's wrong with Bitcoin on this chain.
[75:28] So yeah, Bitcoin is not perfect and
[75:31] particularly with all of this in mind, I
[75:34] believe one of the presentations,
[75:36] there's something that is controversial
[75:37] that really hit me and is that Bitcoin
[75:41] at first and this is like when you are
[75:43] on your way to becoming a Bitcoiner is
[75:46] going to raise your ego. No, that's
[75:48] wrong. No, it doesn't work. You don't
[75:50] know. Look at this. This is right. You
[75:52] know, like Bitcoin fixes this, Bitcoin
[75:54] fixes that.
[75:56] Um and at some
[75:59] moment you know you have to like just
[76:02] again like calm down stop just like
[76:04] listen to yourself. I noticed that you
[76:07] have been arrogant all this time. I
[76:09] noticed that for some people Bitcoin is
[76:12] still not on the spectrum or something
[76:13] that they can do you know and just like
[76:16] like go away from that try to help and
[76:19] listen to the problem so that you can
[76:20] come back to this. So, so yeah. So,
[76:24] yeah, we're not always right. Please,
[76:26] you know, like I wanted to say the f
[76:28] word f in act like that, you
[76:32] know, do something and look to your side
[76:38] and try to listen. Look to your left,
[76:40] look to your right, you know, try to
[76:41] listen like deeply what's the message
[76:44] that the other ones are conveying. Then
[76:46] notice how these people are acting. And
[76:48] if you and if you can and see see like
[76:51] how they how they spend their money, how
[76:53] what they do with it. Yeah. And that's
[76:56] going to tell you the truth. And again,
[76:57] it comes to the other two things that I
[76:59] said, but but I believe that this one
[77:00] was was the main one that not all
[77:02] Bitcoiners are the same. So that's the
[77:04] most controversial thing. And you know,
[77:06] the best part of it is that if half of
[77:08] the Bitcoiners don't agree with this,
[77:10] I'm okay with that. That's that's good.
[77:12] So they know where which side I am. So
[77:14] yeah, that's it. Uh absolutely. Uh it's
[77:19] it's good to be it's almost good to be
[77:21] controversial these days. But yeah,
[77:24] thank you so much. Uh Nelson, um before
[77:26] I let you go, uh really quickly, where
[77:28] can people find you? Ask your questions
[77:29] and reach out to you? Uh sorry, I don't
[77:32] I didn't hear this one. Uh where where
[77:35] can people find you, ask you questions
[77:36] and and reach out to you like where
[77:38] where are your socials? Sure. So I'm
[77:41] call Nelson
[77:43] innovation. It's like it's a like a
[77:45] nickname. My business name. My name is
[77:47] long. only have like four names, you
[77:48] know, like here in Latin America, you
[77:50] can find it if you want. Yeah. Um, so if
[77:53] you look for at Nelson Eno, no D, no,
[77:56] no, anything. Um, you will find me
[77:59] virtually anywhere. Uh, particularly I
[78:02] would love if you can find me on Nster
[78:05] because I like to spend more time there.
[78:07] So I did it in my Twitter already to be
[78:09] honest. So if you tell me like when you
[78:12] publish this like Nelson, uh, here it
[78:14] is, I will maybe log into Twitter. I'll
[78:17] do that once or twice a month. I would
[78:19] just go post, comment, you know, like
[78:22] like repost, reshare, retweet, whatever
[78:24] it's called, comment, like whatever, you
[78:26] know, like send to some friends and then
[78:28] I'm going to log off and not going to be
[78:29] there again. Uh, so yeah, I'm virtually
[78:32] anywhere. But at least like the the the
[78:35] presence looks it's an illusion that I'm
[78:37] there, but in truth, I am absent
[78:40] everywhere so that I can be present
[78:41] somewhere and and is the place. Now the
[78:44] thing is that I have only around 100
[78:47] people that we are following each
[78:49] other.
[78:51] So so yeah that's that's that like
[78:53] that's the thing is like I'll go there
[78:55] and when I post something maybe five or
[78:57] 10 people are going to see and that's
[78:59] still fine but it will be nice you know
[79:01] if if at least I can I can talk with
[79:02] more of you. So if you're someone who
[79:04] who likes whatever I was talking about
[79:07] just follow me there and send me a
[79:10] message. Hey, I follow you. Follow me
[79:11] back. I will follow you back.
[79:13] uh you know I want to connect I have
[79:15] also something that I want to show you I
[79:16] will follow you back instantly so that's
[79:18] one and the second part and this is
[79:20] where I need help and it's very easy is
[79:22] some geyser fund so I want that more
[79:26] bigers have this resource I'm not asking
[79:28] you to go and and donate something there
[79:32] that's not what I I need if you do great
[79:34] I will do big things with this I will
[79:37] convert the book into audio book I will
[79:39] translate to other languages I will
[79:41] print copies so that I can give to
[79:42] people that cannot afford and that you
[79:45] know like a physical copy can do a
[79:47] thing. But if not, just go on guys and
[79:50] follow us. That that's enough. I would
[79:52] try to not send emails too often. Maybe
[79:54] once every two months or three months
[79:56] only where there's something big or send
[79:58] one shot and say hi like it's nothing.
[80:01] Just, you know, like uh help us with the
[80:03] algorithm so that at least we show up
[80:05] somewhere in the search maybe in the hot
[80:06] page one day. That that would be great.
[80:09] Uh and help us spread the book. And if
[80:11] that's too much, if that's too much, go
[80:14] go steing geyser fund, look for unstable
[80:16] innovation. You'll find a book very
[80:18] easily or on or on Google, whatever
[80:19] browser you use, you can go to the
[80:21] website and you can download it for free
[80:23] and read it. So, I'm not taking I'm
[80:25] giving, you know, just give it a chance
[80:28] and if you like it, you know, you can
[80:31] just like take it, you can pirate it.
[80:33] The book has a creative common license,
[80:35] by the way.
[80:38] And yeah, just just just make it yours.
[80:42] It's yours, you know, and give it to
[80:44] whoever you want again. Re-upload it,
[80:46] pirate it. I don't care. I am happier if
[80:50] you read it because I taking a lot of
[80:54] time. It took a lot of mistakes and
[80:58] difficult moments in life to put all of
[81:02] this together. And I believe that if if
[81:05] I share this, we both align and when we
[81:08] all align, we have better chances, you
[81:10] know, aligning values and principles, we
[81:12] have better chance of create better
[81:13] things in the world. So that's it,
[81:16] guys. You look for a stable nation notor
[81:20] for Nelson. And if that's too big of an
[81:22] ask, go to the website and you can
[81:23] download the book for free. Press on
[81:25] buy. Look for the PDF ebook version.
[81:28] It's in English and Spanish now. Like
[81:29] the Spanish version was a donation of a
[81:31] big deal.
[81:33] Um, and and yeah, I everything I ask is
[81:36] for an email. Get a temporary like
[81:39] email, the 24-hour email. That's okay
[81:41] for me, you know. Just if you want to
[81:43] read it, just just get it. You don't
[81:45] have to pay for it. That's the
[81:46] intention. So, help me spread the
[81:48] message and I will help you back.
[81:51] I
[81:52] love him. I I love the creative comments
[81:57] uh license. I I put also my podcast on
[82:00] there and uh people ask me oh like can I
[82:02] use that clip can I use that click and
[82:04] I'm like of course like first of all I
[82:06] cannot control anything like if if the
[82:09] uh things go out and and and spread
[82:12] anyways so I I don't want to control it
[82:14] and I cannot control it and I actually
[82:17] want to spread the word on Bitcoin. So
[82:19] if someone takes something from my
[82:21] podcast and shares it somewhere else,
[82:24] like that's the whole purpose of my
[82:26] podcast that it gets shared like that
[82:28] that the that the message of Bitcoin
[82:30] gets bigger. So I I I do uh uh agree
[82:33] with that a lot. Um thank you so much uh
[82:36] Nelson for for for Oh, sorry. You want
[82:38] to add something? I say yeah and even if
[82:41] if if your message doesn't come with
[82:43] your name, it doesn't matter. You know,
[82:45] you did it. You you share it. You change
[82:47] someone's mind, made them to act, you
[82:49] made you make
[82:51] them, you know, like adopt whatever you
[82:54] wanted to share and go and spread it by
[82:56] themselves. So you reach your goals, you
[82:59] make the world a better place. That's
[83:01] the beautiful thing, you know, like with
[83:03] with full ego that you you don't, you
[83:05] know, yeah, you you still get there. So
[83:07] that's beautiful. And I mean, and it's
[83:09] it's awesome and I believe it's alive
[83:10] what we do. Anyone who's not thinking
[83:12] like this, maybe another controversial
[83:14] thing. It's like we cannot be praising
[83:16] an open innovation system. We cannot be
[83:18] like moving open source everything stuff
[83:20] and then we create stuff and we don't
[83:22] share it with everyone else. Come on.
[83:23] It's like you know like it's like with
[83:25] philosophy people it's like they go and
[83:27] recite
[83:29] hetto says this that that they said the
[83:32] exact words perfectly. they can recite
[83:35] them in Latin, you know, in Greek, in
[83:37] Greek, whatever, you know, whoever said
[83:38] what
[83:40] and and then you see how they live and
[83:42] they don't leave the philosophy. So that
[83:46] I like because what we're trying is to
[83:48] live with but what not what we say is
[83:50] not it's not it's not it's not only what
[83:52] we say, it's also what we do. So we live
[83:54] with this philosophy and yeah, and if
[83:56] we're praising Bitcoin, you know, maybe
[83:58] that's an easy way to see who's who. So
[84:02] yeah, so yeah, it's really cool to to
[84:04] hear it, Robin. Really, really cool.
[84:07] Perfect. Thank you so much, uh, Nelson.
[84:09] That was that was really cool. And also,
[84:11] thank you so much for everyone that is
[84:13] watching and listening for joining us
[84:15] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[84:17] with another episode. Bye-bye.
