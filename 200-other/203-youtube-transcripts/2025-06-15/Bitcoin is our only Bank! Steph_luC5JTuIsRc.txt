[00:00] we do not have a bank account at all so
[00:01] our Reserve is in Bitcoin there will
[00:03] never be a better form of money than
[00:05] Bitcoin it was really important for me
[00:07] to to run a business that is K free if
[00:10] you're not doing anything else at least
[00:11] do self custody with your Bitcoin in
[00:13] Western countries are more and more
[00:16] surveillance obviously there's going to
[00:17] be a long dark night for Western people
[00:21] there was a big exode from Western
[00:23] countries to more three countries this
[00:25] trend will just continue to
[00:27] accelerate you're the founder of Beach
[00:30] Bitcoin As I understood it and it's like
[00:32] a peer-to-peer way to buy and sell
[00:36] Bitcoin
[00:37] right is it is it also no kyc or light
[00:41] kyc or how is this working yeah correct
[00:45] that's uh KC Free up to a certain limit
[00:48] though um so up to 1,000 per day and
[00:55] 100,000 Sr per year so it's slow limits
[00:59] unfortunately it's like limit for for
[01:02] ends a little bit but it's better than
[01:04] nothing and I was like it was really
[01:05] important for me to to to run a business
[01:09] that that that is kway free and I felt
[01:12] like this limit of 1,000 per day is good
[01:14] enough for the average person I would
[01:17] say um so I was like okay um I hate
[01:20] those limit they still completely um
[01:24] yeah insane limits but if this is
[01:27] fitting for the average uh player the
[01:30] average person to stack ads then okay
[01:32] that that that works this is a limit
[01:35] that comes from the Swiss government
[01:37] right yes yes correct and the limit is
[01:42] the same because you are available also
[01:44] outside of Swiss
[01:46] right yes uh we made the app available
[01:49] uh almost globally uh we excluded the IP
[01:54] from the US because the US is you know a
[01:57] little bit uh too tricky too stct and I
[02:00] didn't want to get into trouble with
[02:02] with the US I don't want to end up in J
[02:05] for Bitcoin you know you don't want to
[02:07] be on the wrong side of uh wrong side of
[02:10] the America on the on the wrong list
[02:13] exactly exactly so maybe I mean one day
[02:18] imagine peit goes to the moon blah blah
[02:20] blah we could even think about opening a
[02:23] an entity in the US but that's not
[02:25] planned for now so yes all of this to
[02:27] say pit is available globally except a
[02:30] countries like highrisk countries and
[02:31] now the rule is it's true that the legal
[02:33] rule is a little is a little bit tricky
[02:35] because the services available globally
[02:37] as an internet service but in some
[02:40] countries we are not I guess allowed or
[02:44] supposed to do active marketing so I
[02:47] think that's the you know that's the
[02:50] trick a little bit so yeah and uh so we
[02:53] have a grally and but we didn't
[02:55] integrate with all the currencies yet
[02:57] that's something we we we have to do uh
[03:00] okay so you only have certain uh
[03:03] currencies uh and how like I wonder
[03:08] right now and maybe also people that
[03:10] never bought uh Bitcoin kc3 or with FL
[03:14] KC or like how does no KC work if you
[03:18] have an internet service that then
[03:20] because you have to connect a bank right
[03:22] you like Peach has to have like some
[03:25] connection to a bank account the money
[03:27] has to come somewhere or like how does
[03:29] it work
[03:30] no actually no uh pitch is just the the
[03:34] Matchmaker and Pitch doesn't touch the
[03:36] fat at all so basically you you download
[03:40] the the pit Bitcoin app and uh you are
[03:44] not asked to provide anything to just
[03:47] download the app you just download and
[03:49] you straight have an account um which is
[03:52] your pitch ID so your pitch PB key um
[03:56] you have a wallet as well self custodial
[03:58] wallet so you can uh you can you should
[04:01] save actually your your your s phrase or
[04:03] your gon file that contains the entire
[04:06] pitch account and you create an offer a
[04:09] Buy offer or sell offer according to
[04:11] your preferences so let's say I accept
[04:13] Euro Swiss FR and GBP with PayPal wise
[04:17] revolute bank transfer so I plug all of
[04:20] that into my offer and then I wait for
[04:23] match and uh and pit tells me oh you
[04:26] have a match like a seller is interested
[04:27] into your Buy offer or the other way
[04:30] and uh so we connect together so we if
[04:32] if we kind of agree like we Double match
[04:34] we get into a trade and when I get into
[04:37] a trade with a seller I see his payment
[04:39] details uh pit doesn't see the payment
[04:42] details because they are encrypted and
[04:44] only the trading partner can decrypt the
[04:48] payment details so I will see for
[04:50] example his eban or his revolute ID and
[04:53] then I will have to go outside the pitch
[04:56] app go to my bank account or go to my
[04:58] revolute app make the payment come back
[05:01] to pit click on I made the payment the
[05:04] seller check that he receives the
[05:06] payment he clicks on I receive the
[05:08] payment and when he clicks on I receive
[05:09] the payment the sets that are in the in
[05:12] an escrow are released to the buyer
[05:15] either to his speit wallet or to his
[05:17] external wallet as he
[05:19] prefers how high is the risk when you
[05:22] buy it and you re you uh give the money
[05:26] okay there's there's one person I just
[05:28] want to standard right now on the spot
[05:31] like there's one person that buys
[05:32] Bitcoin so he
[05:34] transfers uh the money to the seller and
[05:37] then the seller has to click oh I
[05:39] received it and then his satosi or his
[05:41] Bitcoin are going from one wallet to
[05:44] another wallet already happened that
[05:46] like he had got the fat payment and did
[05:50] not release the the Bitcoin or how does
[05:52] this is yeah yeah yeah yeah dispute can
[05:55] happen um so right now uh our dispute
[05:59] rate is is quite low um it's like around
[06:01] 3% and 50% of those 3% are self-resolved
[06:06] disputes so just users maybe not
[06:09] understanding how the app works or some
[06:11] stuff like that so how does that happen
[06:14] when there is a dispute um so the seller
[06:18] first of all the seller puts the SATs
[06:20] the Bitcoin into an escrow it's a two
[06:24] out of two multi signature escrow
[06:26] between the seller and pit this is time
[06:28] lock ESC
[06:29] meaning that after
[06:32] 4,230 blocks which is around 30 month um
[06:35] 1 month 30 days sorry um the escrow
[06:39] becomes a single signature for pitch why
[06:42] in case the seller is malicious and
[06:45] doesn't release the set if the seller
[06:47] received the Fiat payment but doesn't
[06:48] click on I receive the payment then the
[06:51] buyer will open a dispute the the P
[06:55] mediator will be able to join the chat
[06:57] message in the app um then when a pitch
[07:00] mediator join the chat messages
[07:02] everything becomes um is decrypted for
[07:05] pitch so pitch can read the chat
[07:06] messages and the payment data only when
[07:09] there is a dispute and then we can
[07:11] settle the dispute if the the seller is
[07:14] malicious then we settle for we we
[07:17] settle the dispute for the buyer and if
[07:19] the seller doesn't want to cooperate in
[07:21] sending the the transaction after 30
[07:23] days after the escrow is funded we can
[07:26] push the sets to the buyer this case uh
[07:30] I malicious sellers didn't happen a lot
[07:33] actually didn't happen a lot because the
[07:35] few I mean yeah the sellers we have on
[07:38] on peit obviously there are fewer
[07:39] sellers than buyers they're actually
[07:41] here to sell they're actually here to
[07:43] make money and the reputation system on
[07:46] Pitch Works quite well so usually if you
[07:50] choose a good seller uh this is not in
[07:53] their interest you know it's not in
[07:55] their incentive let's say to to cheat
[07:57] because the reputation would be highly
[07:58] impacted and then their volume will be
[08:01] highly impacted so they will make less
[08:02] money so yeah so the reputation system
[08:04] is conly constantly constantly evolving
[08:07] sorry and it works quite well as well as
[08:10] um the dis so the escrow the dispute
[08:13] management with the customer support
[08:14] plus the reputation those three are um
[08:17] are let's say the the pillars to make it
[08:20] secure and sound peer-to-peer tra yeah
[08:23] and I think especially the reputation
[08:25] system is really important I was also
[08:28] investigating a lot with Uber and Uber
[08:31] had a similar problem actually because
[08:34] the taxi system was kind of oh there a
[08:36] centralized service it's overlooked by
[08:38] like at least in Austria I don't know
[08:40] how it works all over the world but it's
[08:42] overlooked and the highly regulated taxi
[08:44] networks and you call them and like you
[08:46] have to have a driver license you have
[08:48] to have like different additional
[08:50] license to operate a
[08:52] taxi and uh when Uber came along a lot
[08:56] of people were like oh but I then I'm
[08:58] sitting with a stranger in a car but
[09:00] this stranger wants to make money and
[09:02] over time Uber collected so much data
[09:05] from the driver that they know uh when
[09:08] they did not do something good they got
[09:11] uh rated from uh try from passengers and
[09:16] you could know like you could like oh
[09:19] they has like a 4.9 ratings and like
[09:22] thousands of them already drove with him
[09:25] uh of course he will be good like why
[09:28] should he be not good and and you even
[09:30] know it beforehand and this is like this
[09:34] from centralized to decentralized and I
[09:36] think it's similar with like a
[09:38] centralized exchange like relay 21
[09:41] Bitcoin uh to now like be P2P P2P
[09:45] platform I guess yeah absolutely and and
[09:48] and we went a little bit further in term
[09:51] of the reputation system compared to our
[09:53] current competitors because currently
[09:55] the competitors for the reputation
[09:57] system they only take into account count
[09:59] the peer rating so at the end of the
[10:01] trade you rate your peer basically uh it
[10:05] can be either an amount of stars from
[10:08] one to five stars or sum up sum down we
[10:11] chose for the sum up sum down after some
[10:14] um analysis like anyways um whatever so
[10:18] there is this this is one part of the
[10:19] reputation system but the other part of
[10:21] our reputation system is that we are
[10:23] also tracking the action of the user
[10:26] inside the app so let's say that if you
[10:28] have fun spamming a seller matching and
[10:31] matching matching and matching or
[10:32] canceling a trade something like that
[10:34] you will be impacted if you yeah if you
[10:36] cancel a trade you'll be impacted if you
[10:38] are not fast enough you will be impacted
[10:40] so on top of the score um it's like on
[10:44] five pitches score we have some badges
[10:46] so are you a fast Trader are you a super
[10:48] Trader this type of thing that with a
[10:50] little bit of gamification is but
[10:53] actually taking into account I mean it
[10:55] reflects the user action in the app
[10:59] and not only the not only the peer the
[11:02] peer the perer rating and it works quite
[11:05] well so I'm actually quite happy about
[11:07] this this ID that we had yeah and it's
[11:10] super important I remember I think
[11:12] Airbnb has it also with like batches
[11:15] like super host or something like that
[11:17] because if you're a host that uh proves
[11:20] themselves really good and gets a lot of
[11:22] great ratings has a lot of good things
[11:24] or even with chat things I see it
[11:27] sometimes on chat platforms you want to
[11:29] have a response they write the average
[11:32] response time like oh this host writes
[11:35] back in average in 23 minutes or
[11:37] something like that this gives uh the
[11:39] the one who buys from them or like uses
[11:42] the service whatever the the thing is
[11:45] really good feeling I think um yeah
[11:48] absolutely and I was surprised to be
[11:49] honest by the by the user's reaction
[11:51] because user care about their pitch
[11:53] reputations goore they do care you know
[11:55] we like hey how come I lost my I lost my
[11:57] fast Trader badge that's can you check
[11:59] what happen you know it's like okay yeah
[12:02] let's see if you get it back yeah
[12:04] exactly
[12:06] exactly behave well and you will be
[12:09] rewarded
[12:13] yes is nice maybe to to to to to to to
[12:16] note on this is that um so the pitch
[12:19] accounts when you have a pitch account
[12:21] it's actually um a PB key your pitch ID
[12:24] is is your account PB key so meaning
[12:27] that in the near future we can actually
[12:29] make it exportable a little bit like
[12:32] Noster works you know it's a little bit
[12:35] I mean the same principle kind of so you
[12:38] can so you can make it exportable so
[12:40] basically if you have a very good
[12:41] reputation on Pitch over the past I
[12:43] don't know three years and you want to
[12:45] use it maybe in another Bitcoin platform
[12:47] where you could import your reputation
[12:49] and not starting from scratch then that
[12:52] could be possible in a that that's
[12:54] always amazing interop I cannot
[12:57] pronounce that name
[12:59] yes I'm a German so I can I have
[13:02] problems with that that word but it's so
[13:05] important that we have the working
[13:07] together of different platforms and and
[13:10] the Integrations of different platforms
[13:11] and uh taking something with with us
[13:14] it's like with social media as you said
[13:17] with nostrom you have basically a Bas
[13:19] layer protocol you can use and you can
[13:22] take your followers your uh contacts and
[13:25] your content with you to different
[13:27] clients and that it's amazing I mean
[13:29] still the the network effect of YouTube
[13:32] and Twitter and Spotify and all those
[13:34] platforms are really big and hard to
[13:36] break uh but will be interesting to see
[13:39] how this uh world will be decentralized
[13:43] in the future or will that's actually an
[13:46] interesting question for you um do you
[13:49] think that uh the way we are going uh
[13:53] that we can achieve a mainstream
[13:57] decentralized world where
[13:59] uh we all use a social media Nostra we
[14:02] all use as uh buying platforms something
[14:06] like beach Bitcoin we all use only
[14:08] decentralized things or will there
[14:10] always be for example for YouTube and
[14:12] Twitter centralized centralized
[14:15] platforms how do you see that so it's a
[14:18] it's very hard question because it's
[14:19] hard to predict I I I don't see it
[14:22] either or um I kind of see it both ways
[14:26] maybe I see a multipolar
[14:29] World um I guess I think that I
[14:32] mean because centralization has some
[14:35] Advantage as well it can have some
[14:37] Advantage as well I guess we are very at
[14:39] the premise of decentralization we are
[14:41] very so early at the premise of
[14:43] decentralization of noing things that
[14:45] it's it's it's really it's really hard
[14:47] to to to imagine how it can be in 10
[14:50] years 20 years 30 years from now I'm not
[14:53] even really counting like five years I
[14:54] think it's too really need need to have
[14:57] this this yeah low time reference
[14:59] long-term view I think with this with
[15:02] this change of Paradigm and yes it can
[15:04] be for sure like the more people build
[15:06] on it then the more the ux will be will
[15:08] be friendly because ux is is very very
[15:11] important for for the user so again I
[15:14] think it will take time um that's how I
[15:16] see it it will take time and then I
[15:18] don't necessarily see a black or white
[15:21] world I see a world I guess where I
[15:24] don't know maybe people will maybe who
[15:26] will be lucky enough to choose to move
[15:28] to
[15:29] some places where they have some more
[15:31] white choices we'll be able to use those
[15:34] white choices and uh yeah that that's
[15:36] that's how I see it and just a note
[15:38] pitch is not fully decentralized given
[15:40] that pitch is a company so that's an
[15:44] important note I I want to make because
[15:46] um yeah it's a company like uh it's a
[15:49] company basically but then the order
[15:50] book is decentralized it's a
[15:52] peer-to-peer order book so um it's not
[15:55] basically the order book is pitch id1
[15:57] 123 but
[15:59] 1 million sets to pit ID
[16:02] 456 on February the 12th that's the
[16:06] order book so this order book isal it's
[16:08] not like um
[16:10] Step about 1 million set
[16:13] to De centralized exchange you know so
[16:16] that's really the the difference so
[16:20] basically when the government shuts down
[16:22] Beach it does not affect the users it
[16:26] just affects the company and the you the
[16:28] service is not no longer available right
[16:30] so the service exactly the service will
[16:32] no longer be available for the simple
[16:34] reason because of the eso because we
[16:36] have a key on the esro for dispute
[16:39] management the day we actually change
[16:42] the model and find a way to decentralize
[16:45] the
[16:46] escrow uh the escrow solution the the
[16:50] the dispute management Etc uh maybe that
[16:54] day Yes actually you know we can move to
[16:56] to another business model again I think
[16:59] the advantage the issue that I have with
[17:01] that is that I think that a centralized
[17:04] um customer support or dispute
[17:06] management is more efficient the reason
[17:08] why the only reason why we want we would
[17:10] like to build a decentralized the
[17:11] dispute management is because of control
[17:15] surveillance uh violence from the states
[17:18] that's the only reason why so it's
[17:19] actually a defense action because if we
[17:22] were in a free world where they were
[17:24] like well do a business you're not
[17:26] you're not harming anyone right so do
[17:28] you're not hurting anyone so I mean you
[17:31] can do whatever business you want we
[17:33] maybe I would not even think about oh
[17:35] but maybe one day we need to to create a
[17:37] decentralized uh escrow and dispute
[17:40] management because I wouldn't need to
[17:42] because mine is efficient and I wouldn't
[17:44] be afraid of being closed down
[17:46] surveilled controlled etc etc so yeah
[17:50] it's a defense mechanism a lot I think
[17:52] yeah but but it seems that uh the
[17:55] jurisdictions you are sitting in Swiss
[17:59] is quite friendly to bitcoin from the
[18:02] regulation I'm rarely in in Switzerland
[18:04] but I interviewed a lot of of Swiss
[18:06] people uh already uh and it seems like
[18:10] Swiss regulations are quite friendly
[18:14] compared to other uh countries like just
[18:17] Austria take it as example yeah no no
[18:20] there's some interesting stuff like I
[18:22] don't know if you knew but um Pitch is
[18:24] 100% on a Bitcoin standard we do not
[18:27] have a bank account at all oh wow yeah
[18:31] that's quite fun uh zero bank accounts
[18:34] no bank accounts so our Reserve is in
[18:36] Bitcoin we do everything in Bitcoin
[18:38] basically we have a wallet a Bitcoin
[18:40] wallet which is our pitch reserve and we
[18:43] operate from from this and so we created
[18:45] the company in Bitcoin so with the
[18:47] notary as well we B the first capital
[18:50] you know to create the company you need
[18:51] to bring a a first capital in cash that
[18:54] was in Bitcoin as well so everything was
[18:57] uh was in Bitcoin I is in Bitcoin wow
[19:01] that's uh I did not know that so like
[19:04] this is like a company where it's proved
[19:07] from the starting it was only Bitcoin
[19:10] and when did you start
[19:12] 2021 2022 early February yeah February
[19:17] 2022 oh that's uh that's really really
[19:20] cool I thought 2021 because I think the
[19:23] the Twitter account of peach was uh
[19:26] there before but yeah that can be like
[19:28] uh before ideation pH starts before the
[19:32] company
[19:35] yes uh but that's really cool a company
[19:38] that's completely on a Bitcoin standard
[19:41] and uh uh how many like how many
[19:44] employes do you have or like how how big
[19:46] is uh if you can talk about that uh like
[19:50] I don't want to force you into
[19:53] answer how big
[19:55] is so it's it's it keeps changing it
[20:01] keeps changing we started at four then
[20:04] we were three then we were four five up
[20:06] until 9 now we're back at three 4 with
[20:09] an intern it's yeah it's it's a roller
[20:13] coaster basically it keeps changing and
[20:16] with every company there's a lot of I
[20:19] think uncertainty in there and you have
[20:22] to change quickly to to the market see
[20:24] and learning as well learning like uh
[20:27] running a startup is a is a complete new
[20:31] adventure basically so so yeah I'm super
[20:36] excited to announce that this podcast
[20:39] got the first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is
[20:43] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[20:46] and preach self custody this is my go-to
[20:50] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[20:52] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[20:54] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if if
[20:58] you want lower fees Plus at the same
[21:00] time support this podcast use code Robin
[21:03] and click the link in the description
[21:05] what did you do before like did you work
[21:07] in a fat job uh straight out from okay
[21:10] fat jop what what did you do there yes I
[21:13] had uh I started my uh well yeah when I
[21:16] started working in Switzerland I started
[21:18] in in F job like um um product manager
[21:22] product marketing manager this type of
[21:24] things for for multinationals company in
[21:28] um in the retail business well retail
[21:31] it's not retail it's fast moving
[21:32] consumer goods company I work for
[21:34] different type of of of Industries and a
[21:37] few years before starting Peach I
[21:40] started to discover crypto in 2017 um
[21:44] and I was hired as a freelancer as well
[21:47] uh to work with some like I worked with
[21:50] an I mean OG investor he had some
[21:53] startups and I was managing his startups
[21:55] somehow well this type of stuff um um
[21:58] that led me to to enter the world of
[22:01] crypto in 2017 and very quickly I was
[22:05] not satisfied with um with what crypto
[22:09] is for and so very very quickly I fell
[22:12] down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and and
[22:14] then I I started pit Bitcoin what was it
[22:18] that was not satisfying you about crypto
[22:22] and made you go on bitcoin only what is
[22:24] it for I didn't understand that no like
[22:28] what what made you go from uh like you
[22:32] said that uh crypto did not was not good
[22:35] for you uh then you go went down the
[22:38] Bitcoin rabbit hole and you went Bitcoin
[22:41] only I guess uh as I also did like in
[22:44] the first year where I discovered crypto
[22:46] and then after one year I went Bitcoin
[22:48] only and then completely I converted
[22:51] everything I had in Bitcoin only I had
[22:53] like stocks I had a lot of different
[22:54] things and converted everything to
[22:56] bitcoin um so and for me it was a big
[23:00] thing when I discovered oh Bitcoin is
[23:02] sound money and Bitcoin is a
[23:04] decentralized store of value that nobody
[23:07] can take from me nobody can stop me from
[23:10] transacting with someone and when I got
[23:14] that in in like it was a year of
[23:17] learning but when I got it in inside of
[23:21] like one month I made the decision sold
[23:23] all my stocks sold everything I had uh
[23:26] even like when through through the house
[23:29] and the apartment like can I sell
[23:30] anything I actually went through the
[23:32] whole thing and in 2021 I went all in uh
[23:36] and it's a crazy Journey till since then
[23:38] but there's different things about
[23:40] Bitcoin that make people go Bitcoin only
[23:44] and away from all the altcoins all the
[23:47] shitcoins my uh my issue I mean the
[23:50] reason why I didn't click with with
[23:51] crypto is that I didn't understand what
[23:54] it what what it was for what what was
[23:57] the purpose of it what it was for what
[23:58] is it solving you know what is the yeah
[24:02] basically this and when very often the
[24:05] answer I received I remember was um yeah
[24:08] we're going to secure some data blah
[24:11] blah blah and I was like okay how and
[24:13] very often when I even asked the how
[24:15] even though I'm not um I'm not into the
[24:17] I'm not deep into Tech but the answer
[24:20] were so light and so just oh don't
[24:23] bother it's just going to secure the
[24:25] data basically I was like okay well and
[24:29] when and when I understood a little bit
[24:32] when I started to understand that that
[24:34] oh Bitcoin is actually here to be the
[24:39] global Reserve um money the yeah
[24:44] monetary global system because it's here
[24:46] to be um to be a new form of money I was
[24:50] like o okay like there is definitely
[24:53] some I mean this is this is something
[24:56] like like it's so a problem it solve
[24:58] something and we understand why it
[25:01] exists basically why the why it exist
[25:03] the why is very important to me and so
[25:06] yeah that that was that why I am I
[25:08] continue on on the Bitcoin Journey just
[25:11] like you yeah it's it's it's it's crazy
[25:13] to see um and once you understand that
[25:18] in like if you if you take blockchain
[25:21] technology as as a thing for me the only
[25:24] purpose for
[25:25] blockchain uh is
[25:28] if you have a public transparent Ledger
[25:31] like with Bitcoin and then on top of
[25:33] things top of that you can even make
[25:36] applications and stuff like that uh I
[25:38] don't care for those but you can do it
[25:41] if you want um outside of that a
[25:44] blockchain is a really inefficient way
[25:47] to store
[25:48] data and this is something like I'm a
[25:52] software developer in my like now right
[25:54] now I'm not a software developer but I
[25:55] learned it and I worked in that
[25:58] department for like years so I know that
[26:03] storing data on a blockchain is really
[26:06] inefficient compared to other ways to
[26:08] storing data but in terms of Bitcoin it
[26:12] makes sense because you have to have
[26:14] this uh indestructible Ledger that
[26:17] everybody can rely on so when we have
[26:19] that one use case money uh that's
[26:22] already filled with Bitcoin there will
[26:24] never or not in the next 200 years I
[26:28] guess I don't want to say never uh be a
[26:31] better form of money than Bitcoin maybe
[26:33] even in the next 10,000 years I don't
[26:35] know if there's ever like something that
[26:37] replaces Bitcoin might be but I cannot
[26:40] imagine it like in the next hundreds of
[26:42] years um but there's no we don't need to
[26:47] take all the video games on a blockchain
[26:49] it's it's really inefficient way to do
[26:52] that and this made a really soon click
[26:54] from me you said that why is an
[26:56] important
[26:58] uh topic for you and I I will ask the
[27:00] question now even though like I kind of
[27:02] know the answer but for new people that
[27:05] maybe are coming now into Bitcoin they
[27:08] asking themselves um oh when I buy peer
[27:12] top Bitcoin no free kyc I go through the
[27:16] some hurdles uh that are maybe more
[27:18] hurdles than uh when I buy just on a
[27:21] centralized exchange uh sometimes why
[27:25] does it matter we by peer-to-peer no KC
[27:30] Bitcoin on on a platform like beach
[27:34] Bitcoin okay I guess so there there are
[27:37] multiple things that can be said and
[27:39] also very much different perspective
[27:42] okay one of my perspective is that
[27:45] Bitcoin is okay so Bitcoin is a new form
[27:48] of money Bitcoin is a money that is
[27:50] created because the current system the
[27:51] current money doesn't work so Bitcoin
[27:54] allows us to opt out from A system that
[27:57] is d
[27:58] the system who is that is currently
[28:00] dying doesn't necessarily like to have
[28:03] you opting out from the system that we
[28:05] are feeding on a day-to-day basis you
[28:07] know they want us to keep feeding them
[28:10] so this is why also the the they they
[28:14] came up with all those know your
[28:15] customer Ro basically we want to know
[28:17] everything that you're doing to be able
[28:19] to track you and to be able to control
[28:21] you and make sure that you stay in our
[28:23] Matrix so you can still feed us you know
[28:27] like work for us slaves basically so
[28:31] opting out in a private way seems a kind
[28:35] of good idea basically opting out from
[28:38] the fat system without the F fat system
[28:42] to necessarily know how you're opting
[28:44] out how much you're opting out what's
[28:47] the value in your pocket because that's
[28:49] your own business they don't have to
[28:51] know it because if they know it they
[28:53] will want to steal it from you basically
[28:56] so this whole p privacy um thing opting
[28:59] out in a private way chaa you know
[29:03] trano basically is I think a very good
[29:06] um a very good reason why to buy KC Free
[29:09] K free Bitcoin so yeah so that's that's
[29:12] one reason the second reason is that I
[29:14] as pitch um then I do not see uh the I I
[29:20] do not have a database as you were
[29:21] talking about I know I do not have a
[29:23] centralized database with your name uh
[29:27] and the amount of sets that you bought
[29:29] or that you sold so I cannot I cannot
[29:33] use that against you basically so that's
[29:36] also an additional safety for you as a
[29:39] user for your privacy once again for
[29:41] your protection to BU peer-to-peer um
[29:45] that's the second thing um and the third
[29:48] thing that I would that I would add as
[29:50] well is um is maybe more um practicality
[29:53] even though it can also be a very um
[29:55] it's Al it can also be linked to privacy
[29:57] is the choice of payment methods because
[30:00] usually when you buy um uh an
[30:03] centralized exchange so not only the
[30:05] exchange know how much you B but also
[30:07] the bank usually they use bank transfer
[30:09] the bank knows as well because the bank
[30:11] sees that oh you sent 100 euro to
[30:15] binance or whatever exchange uh so they
[30:19] know they know it's binance they know
[30:21] it's even R they know it and sometimes
[30:23] it has been it has been um you know it
[30:25] has been censored as well transaction
[30:27] are sensor whereas if you send a bank
[30:31] transfer uh from step to Robin I send
[30:34] you 100 euros it can be for dinner that
[30:37] we had yesterday you know and in fact
[30:39] under the hood I bought Bitcoin from you
[30:42] but they do not know so this this this
[30:45] third reason is actually is actually an
[30:47] important reason I think very important
[30:50] one so censorship it's a bit more
[30:51] censorship resistance to buy peerto peer
[30:54] and then the choice of payment method
[30:56] also make you more
[30:58] make you more resilient as well because
[31:00] you can use okay my bank just censored
[31:02] me well maybe I can use Amazon gift
[31:05] cards maybe I can use wise maybe I can
[31:07] create an account in other online
[31:10] wallets like uh I don't know bom in
[31:13] Spain or Portugal whatever so yeah the
[31:16] variety of choice the protection the
[31:18] Privacy U makes it all very I think
[31:21] appealing and what I wanted to achieve
[31:24] with with with Peach is to make it
[31:26] appealing but make it accessible because
[31:29] the reason why we go to centralized
[31:30] exchange is because it's like oh it's
[31:32] going to be easy yeah it's going to be
[31:33] easy for me I don't want to to think
[31:35] about it too much that's the reason why
[31:37] and that bothered me I was like no we
[31:39] need to make peer-to-peer
[31:41] extremely Bitcoin peer top extremely
[31:44] accessible as well um so that's um look
[31:49] just earlier on you talked about taxi
[31:50] versus Uber like you know it's a bit the
[31:54] same thing you know like 10 years ago
[31:56] maybe would didn't think that oh you're
[31:58] going to kind of peer-to peer your right
[32:00] through a centralized
[32:03] Matchmaker well now you do it every
[32:04] single day so why not with Bitcoin as
[32:08] well you know that's there are amazing
[32:11] reasons and I just want to add an
[32:13] additional reason for uh privacy that's
[32:16] how how important that is um when you
[32:20] have uh when some centralized exchange
[32:24] stores your data how much Bitcoin did
[32:26] you buy when did you buy it and stuff
[32:28] like that um even if they are completely
[32:32] acting in their best interest they can
[32:34] be hacked and we saw that so many times
[32:37] in the past where centralized exchange
[32:39] get hacked uh and basically yeah then
[32:43] they are in trouble and I had I think a
[32:45] few days on from cedor Chris from cedor
[32:50] from the hardware wallet on and he said
[32:53] he um uh and and maybe that's uh that's
[32:57] that's different how you view it than
[32:59] than he views it and he said he
[33:02] recommends everyone that having two
[33:05] stacks actually a complete no KC P2P
[33:08] privacy stack and a KC stack he's like
[33:13] for for for him that's like the the best
[33:16] setup to have like two different Stacks
[33:19] the one that nobody knows about and the
[33:21] the one that's uh just uh low fees is
[33:24] easy and you can do it uh and and I
[33:27] actually have to try Beach Bitcoin after
[33:29] that interview I did not do it till now
[33:31] so I have to see how easy it is and how
[33:34] good it how good it is because I have
[33:37] always in my comment I'm writing about
[33:38] different stuffs and and and and and a
[33:41] lot of people are like oh you should try
[33:43] Beach Bitcoin like I got I get this
[33:45] message uh like at least once a week or
[33:48] maybe once a month or something like
[33:50] that like I get uh Beach Bitcoin more
[33:52] and more and uh I made a public tweet I
[33:56] think
[33:57] a year ago or something like that where
[34:00] I said I want to go away from Bon Bon is
[34:03] this horrible Bitcoin exchange that went
[34:06] into this complete shitcoin casino with
[34:09] all the shitcoins this was the first
[34:11] thing that bothered me a lot that they
[34:12] introduced so many shitcoins to bitcoin
[34:15] one day I was like hey bye Shino and
[34:17] this popped up on my phone and I was
[34:19] like no thank you who who's telling me
[34:22] that oh my Bitcoin exchange is telling
[34:24] me that uh and then few few months later
[34:27] they ask me where my money is coming
[34:30] from like I have some res respect for
[34:34] when they ask me oh can you identify
[34:36] yourself I can understand if they want
[34:38] to uh have like the regulations and they
[34:41] want to know okay is that person really
[34:44] a person and stuff like that it's like
[34:46] it it makes a little bit sense in my
[34:49] mind to to make that but what makes no
[34:52] sense for me that they know where my
[34:54] money is coming from honestly no one's
[34:56] business uh and it's not like that I
[34:59] transferred Millions it's like it was a
[35:01] low number of of things that I bought uh
[35:04] so I was like I'm away from that and
[35:07] then I made the the the Tweet I'm
[35:09] switching away from Bon and I had a
[35:11] small account back then uh and then I
[35:14] was like where should I switch to and it
[35:16] got completely viral and then was like
[35:19] relay 21 Bitcoin Beach Bitcoin there
[35:21] like so many different because my only
[35:24] thing back then was it has to be bit
[35:27] only and it's also right now for me when
[35:30] uh people ask me where to buy Bitcoin
[35:33] Bitcoin only is the the biggest thing
[35:35] for me privacy is something I want to
[35:39] get people in that are already in
[35:41] Bitcoin like when because sometimes it
[35:44] can be like I want to eliminate in the
[35:46] beginning when I orange pill someone the
[35:49] hurdles for everybody as much as
[35:52] possible so I want to send them to a
[35:54] platform that's Bitcoin only and
[35:58] EAS then they have no choice they're
[36:01] buying some like I sent them hey buy
[36:03] Bitcoin and then they're coming tomorrow
[36:05] hey I buy Solano I'm like no what did
[36:07] you do I agree that's important the
[36:10] focus the focus on the signal is is
[36:13] important yes and it has to be really
[36:15] easy because every like and then when
[36:18] once they IND there then they can uh put
[36:21] more more stuff stuff in that direction
[36:24] yeah okay uh um maybe question that just
[36:29] came up in in my mind how do you see or
[36:32] like what do you see as like the biggest
[36:33] risks for Bitcoin uh in the next like
[36:38] five 10 years and uh maybe also like in
[36:42] terms of cbdcs do you see there an an
[36:45] risk and why what do you see there the
[36:50] the the the risk at least in um in
[36:53] Western countries are more and more
[36:56] surveill
[36:57] that's that that is the risk more and
[36:59] more civilians and well again I
[37:04] guess if you want to make if if you want
[37:06] to I mean if I were them if I want to
[37:09] impact uh bitcoiners and prevent them to
[37:11] actually buy Bitcoin what do I do I just
[37:14] shut down all the diamond exchanges
[37:16] that's what I would do so or or i k see
[37:18] the hell out of all of them or something
[37:20] like that so yeah more and more control
[37:23] over exchanges for sure on ramp of ramp
[37:26] uh um that's that's uh that's that's the
[37:29] risk that's the the biggest risk in in
[37:31] in my opinion well this is already
[37:33] happening so yeah and then in term of
[37:36] cbdc I well I know it's coming I don't
[37:40] exactly well I don't know how it's going
[37:43] exactly going to be executed
[37:46] so yeah it's very hard to say Obviously
[37:49] that's going to be that's going to be a
[37:51] um a long um dark night I think for for
[37:55] Western people people the ones who would
[37:58] be lucky enough to be able to move then
[38:01] I think we move I think this is what is
[38:03] Happ this is what's going to happen and
[38:04] this is what is already happening right
[38:06] now um you're basically people are
[38:09] basically moving to to countries
[38:11] jurisdiction
[38:13] territories where they feel more atas
[38:16] where they feel more free um so that's
[38:18] what happened while we saw it during
[38:20] during covid and there was a big exod
[38:23] from Western countries to more free
[38:25] countries uh I think this this this
[38:28] trend will just continue to to to
[38:31] accelerate so yeah it will continue to
[38:34] accelerate but it will not be I I don't
[38:36] see the entire world being black dark
[38:40] you know world I really see that there
[38:43] will be some places of light in the
[38:47] world yeah let's hope for
[38:50] that and this is a common thing in in
[38:53] Bitcoin that it gives people hope again
[38:57] that's really cool uh we having an end
[39:00] routine in the podcast where the
[39:02] previous guest asks a question for the
[39:04] next guest uh and the question goes a
[39:08] little bit into what we just talked
[39:10] about do you think the Bitcoin EF will
[39:13] be or can be confiscated I mean can be
[39:17] of course but will it be confiscated so
[39:19] I'm absolutely not an expert into all
[39:21] those trading things my initial thought
[39:24] would be why what are the Inc of
[39:26] confiscating it I mean if I mean the
[39:31] the
[39:33] the the question was around the thing as
[39:36] well you know I think the question from
[39:39] the guest was around uh there was in the
[39:42] history a lot of times where uh the
[39:45] governments all around the world
[39:48] confiscated
[39:50] gold and gold is a little bit easier to
[39:53] confiscate because it's physical and
[39:56] Bitcoin is hard to confiscate but
[40:00] when but in a way if you don't own your
[40:03] Bitcoin it's in a way already confiscate
[40:08] confiscated confiscated if you don't own
[40:10] your keys then in a way um you put
[40:13] yourself at risk of being confiscated at
[40:15] any time so yeah it can be confiscated
[40:19] yeah for sure like your account on
[40:21] whatever exchanges or yeah yeah
[40:24] absolutely it can yes
[40:26] yeah like Bitcoin ETF can be an an
[40:30] extreme big honey pot for America and I
[40:34] talked with the last guest about this uh
[40:36] it's like when they all of the sudden
[40:39] came to know I like oh gold is not the
[40:42] world Reserve asset anymore it's Bitcoin
[40:46] now H we have a lot of Bitcoin sitting
[40:48] there at the ETF we have a little a lot
[40:50] of Bitcoin sitting there and there's
[40:52] like a crisis going on and then oh we
[40:55] have to take this Bitcoin coin in the
[40:56] best interest for all the American
[40:59] citizens like it's I don't know if it
[41:02] happens I put it at a low probability
[41:04] that it will happen but there's a chance
[41:07] and I'm always saying self custody like
[41:11] that's the that's the most important
[41:13] thing uh if you're not doing anything
[41:15] else at least do self- custody with your
[41:17] Bitcoin if you if you buy it full uh
[41:21] full KC and you you do a lot of things
[41:24] with your Bitcoin at least put it in
[41:26] self custody then the next step for me
[41:30] is like privacy and there a lot lot of
[41:32] things Co join whatever what what on top
[41:35] what you can do and then you can even do
[41:38] more cyber security in general for
[41:39] yourself I worked also in cyber security
[41:42] in in the past so I know a lot of things
[41:44] you can do there uh but at least do the
[41:47] self custody at least don't give anybody
[41:50] else y Keys yeah yeah yeah 100% I really
[41:54] think that's the number one thing to to
[41:57] to preach yeah yeah um yeah thank you
[42:00] Steph for for being on the the podcast
[42:03] it was really short lift really really
[42:05] cool and uh I hope uh we can we can talk
[42:09] in the future more with pleasure thank
[42:11] you very much
[42:16] again
