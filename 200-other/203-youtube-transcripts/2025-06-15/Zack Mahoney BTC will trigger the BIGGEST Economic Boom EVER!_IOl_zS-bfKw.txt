[00:00] Bitcoin is going to have a massive and
[00:02] profound impact on human behavior
[00:03] filmmakers have a real issue when it
[00:05] comes to monetizing their work or even
[00:08] having access to a market there's really
[00:09] a couple big players and they sort of
[00:11] control the production they control the
[00:13] exhibition Bitcoin enlightening and
[00:14] digital payments have the potential to
[00:16] solve a lot of those issues we're on the
[00:18] cusp of maybe the greatest economic
[00:20] period in all of human history we want
[00:22] the market to do what markets do May the
[00:25] best film win what's the difference
[00:26] between art and propaganda I think the
[00:28] answer to that is where the money's
[00:29] coming from from it's hard to do that on
[00:31] stripe you're not going to do that on a
[00:33] rails and so when that friction gets
[00:35] introduced you end up with a lot of
[00:37] companies who are in between it right
[00:38] like stripe might say hey I don't like
[00:40] what's going on on Indie Hub I think
[00:41] that you guys are doing things that are
[00:43] illegal or that the government's going
[00:44] to say hey we'll we'll shut you down so
[00:46] there's just these little Gatekeepers
[00:47] that get in the way of that flow of uh
[00:49] that relationship Bitcoin is going to
[00:51] have a huge impact on the business
[00:53] models we're going to continue to see a
[00:56] decentralization of voices and product
[00:59] and opinion the job of an artist in my
[01:01] opinion is to really ride that line of
[01:03] Consciousness between you know Order and
[01:05] Chaos the freedom to transact is is as
[01:07] important if not more important than
[01:09] freedom of speech actions speak louder
[01:11] than words even Darkness knows who
[01:12] writes its check there's one Authority
[01:14] and that is creation there's nothing
[01:16] more powerful than that and destruction
[01:18] serves creation it always has it always
[01:22] [Music]
[01:24] will what are you doing with like film
[01:27] making and in connection with with
[01:29] Bitcoin Co so the idea uh the idea is
[01:32] simple um we've got a film exhibition
[01:35] platform uh for filmmakers to exhibit
[01:38] their work and um get my knee out of the
[01:41] frame
[01:42] here and uh you know I we're just trying
[01:46] to make it simple if your movie is being
[01:47] watched you're being paid if it's not
[01:49] being watched you're not being paid uh
[01:51] kind of a simple concept so we built a
[01:54] platform you know on top of lightning
[01:56] the whole thing's kind of built on that
[01:57] payments infrastructure and uh we're
[01:59] just trying to utilize you know a global
[02:01] distributed payments protocol um in
[02:04] order to get filmmakers paid for their
[02:06] work so you know we allow filmmakers
[02:10] to uh not just generate Revenue by
[02:13] second but we can also split that
[02:15] Revenue uh on a filmmaker's cap table if
[02:17] they so choose so um you know if there's
[02:21] five or six
[02:22] people excuse me if there's five or six
[02:25] people uh you know involved in a project
[02:28] they can split that Revenue many ways
[02:30] and whatever percentage uh that they
[02:32] deem appropriate so it's a little bit
[02:35] like for podcasting and Fountain uh it's
[02:39] for filmmakers for you and Bitcoin yeah
[02:42] that's right I L it a lot it's actually
[02:45] really cool because um Fountain is an
[02:49] amazing platform as as I found until now
[02:51] it's that there's not too many people
[02:53] right now watching compared to like
[02:55] YouTube and and all the other platform
[02:57] Spotify and apple podcast they like the
[02:59] biggest platform
[03:00] but uh the the quality of comments and
[03:03] and the feedback you get from there is
[03:05] like really nice and I kind of imagine
[03:08] that also for for that what what you're
[03:10] trying to do um before we get into that
[03:13] why did you even get started with that
[03:15] like did you saw some some some problems
[03:17] with Cinema and and uh the the movie
[03:20] industry yeah yeah a lot of
[03:23] problems
[03:25] um so I spent uh I spent my career in
[03:28] film and television I started my career
[03:29] as an actor
[03:30] um almost 20 years ago did that for a
[03:33] number of years and then I uh you know
[03:36] bounced around the production side of
[03:37] things directing producing editing um
[03:39] just kind of everything you could
[03:41] imagine and when I stumbled into the
[03:44] crypto World in 2017 I pretty you know
[03:47] once the idea connected for me that you
[03:49] could stream value in the way that we
[03:52] stream data uh I immediately realized
[03:56] that that could solve a lot of the
[03:57] problems that I had both as an artist
[03:59] and and the business side of film making
[04:01] um so you know filmmakers have a
[04:06] real uh have a real issue when it comes
[04:09] to monetizing their work um or even
[04:12] having access to a market uh you know
[04:14] there's really a couple big players and
[04:16] they sort of control the production they
[04:17] control the
[04:18] exhibition um you know YouTube in my
[04:21] opinion you know while a really cool uh
[04:25] product isn't really appropriate for the
[04:27] art of film making you know we hear this
[04:29] you know it's turned into this word
[04:31] content your content creator you know um
[04:34] I don't really I don't really know what
[04:35] that word means I don't I don't like
[04:36] that word I'm a filmmaker we make movies
[04:39] you know it's a particular kind of art
[04:41] form um you know that has particular
[04:44] expectations from an exhibition
[04:45] perspective and a production perspective
[04:47] and it's very unique in its business
[04:49] model um so I think that uh I think that
[04:54] there needs to be something that's more
[04:56] appropriate uh for that you know that
[04:58] structure and uh I think that I think
[05:01] the Bitcoin enlightening and digital
[05:02] payments you know have the potential at
[05:04] least to to solve a lot of those issues
[05:06] it's super interesting Al like uh
[05:08] decentralizing the whole whole thing
[05:11] it's uh I get more and more guests with
[05:13] with uh that are not Direct in Bitcoin
[05:16] but doing something with Bitcoin uh like
[05:18] even with decentralizing Healthcare data
[05:21] and also decentralizing film making to a
[05:24] certain extent even though like inab is
[05:27] still a centralized platform uh but uses
[05:29] a decentralized platform really
[05:31] interesting uh what you're doing um Can
[05:35] anyone then upload a movie there or how
[05:38] do how does it uh is it different to a
[05:41] platform like Netflix or platform like
[05:44] um uh
[05:45] YouTube it'll be a little bit of a
[05:47] hybrid approach um I think you said it
[05:49] well you know there's Indie Hub is C
[05:51] certainly a centralized platform um as
[05:54] far as you know the servers are
[05:55] concerned and data is concerned and
[05:56] payments are concerned um or I should
[05:59] say payouts are concerned we're using
[06:01] you know obviously we're using lightning
[06:02] but um users will anyone can upload a
[06:08] project upload a film uh there will be a
[06:11] minor screening process you know we just
[06:13] making sure there's not like obscene
[06:14] content or uh inappropriate movies or or
[06:17] things that aren't movies at all you
[06:19] know like we're not looking for uh Tik
[06:21] Tok type stuff or you know things like
[06:23] that so there's a little bit of a filter
[06:25] on our end we're just making sure that
[06:27] it's appropriate for the platform but we
[06:28] do want to make sure that it is uh kind
[06:31] of as wide a net as possible um within
[06:34] that and we want the market to do what
[06:36] markets do and you know may the best
[06:39] film win you know if people are really
[06:41] watching it and they're really
[06:41] responding to it you're you're getting
[06:43] paid interesting so when you watch a
[06:46] movie there uh you pay per minute or
[06:48] like how does the this this work so uh
[06:51] the way the structure is now for the
[06:53] from the audience side of things you're
[06:54] going to pay a monthly subscription uh
[06:56] to have access to the platform so it'll
[06:57] feel like Netflix or Hulu or ever um and
[07:01] the payouts are what's happening on
[07:02] Lightning now uh you can pay you know if
[07:06] you want to pay that subscription
[07:07] enlightening we're going to be enabling
[07:08] that here shortly we're waiting on a
[07:10] couple little things uh to go through
[07:12] from a technical perspective um but
[07:14] we're not at the point yet where it's
[07:16] like connect a wallet uh and then have
[07:19] sat stream directly out of that wallet
[07:22] um that being said we are we're very
[07:26] very early on integrating the RSS 2.0
[07:29] spec um so in that world uh users
[07:33] filmmakers will be able to publish their
[07:35] movies over RSS and uh in that realm uh
[07:40] users will be able to attach a lightning
[07:43] wallet and actually stream STS or tip
[07:45] directly to that filmmaker and their cap
[07:47] table so we're trying to you know kind
[07:49] of attack both angles of it um but the
[07:51] RSS stuff that's very very early I mean
[07:54] we are super early on that and and I
[07:56] don't expect you know kind of mainstream
[07:58] movie goers to to uh be able
[08:02] to uh facilitate that kind of tech on
[08:04] their end for quite some time it's still
[08:06] pretty
[08:07] complicated that's interesting yeah it's
[08:10] it's it's fascinating for me that uh
[08:11] that we can use like it opens up so many
[08:14] possibilities when when all of the
[08:16] sudden we have a a protocol like
[08:19] lightning uh where we can actually be uh
[08:23] paying per whatever second minute hour
[08:26] what we watching like actual like if you
[08:28] have a Netflix subscri ion and and you
[08:30] don't watch for like 3 months you're
[08:32] still paying but if you're like watching
[08:34] heavily then you're maybe like using
[08:37] more of that of that and it's
[08:39] interesting the consume per actual like
[08:42] the the paying per actual consume an
[08:45] interesting concept which probably makes
[08:48] people more aware of things I don't know
[08:50] if it's a good thing when it's something
[08:53] like a relaxing thing like a movie I
[08:56] don't know if people get freaked out
[08:57] like oh [ __ ] like every second that I
[08:59] watch more than movie that it's it's
[09:01] going off my wallet could be a bad bad
[09:04] effect of of that but it's interesting
[09:06] concept I love it a lot yeah yeah I mean
[09:09] we're still so early in this and we're
[09:11] you know Indie hub's definitely
[09:12] pioneering uh this new world um I don't
[09:16] I don't have you know I don't have a
[09:17] crystal ball I don't know how this is
[09:18] all going to shake out but I I think
[09:20] that I think that there is a new
[09:22] business model to be had here with that
[09:23] um and we're going to just try to make
[09:25] it work uh whichever direction it goes
[09:28] and really just be the appropriate tool
[09:30] for filmmakers to monetize so whether
[09:32] they want to do it over RSS or they want
[09:34] to do it you know locally on Indie Hub
[09:36] uh we we we want them to have the
[09:37] ability to make that
[09:39] choice you also said in the in the
[09:42] beginning that you see uh a difference
[09:44] between you don't like the wood content
[09:46] creator by the way I also don't like
[09:47] that word like yeah like you you you you
[09:51] you're doing content it's like okay what
[09:53] what content is like it is a very prod
[09:56] like if if if someone in a company
[10:00] is producing exle sheets as a report
[10:02] that's that seems to be a content
[10:04] creator right like he's producing
[10:05] content that should not be compared with
[10:08] like filmmaker so I don't like that word
[10:11] because it's very generalistic like
[10:13] every almost everyone is making content
[10:15] in some sort of some sense um but uh
[10:19] what do you think is is like the the
[10:21] difference between um uh like the the
[10:24] Comm the commercial movies than like
[10:26] Indie movies independent movies uh and
[10:29] then even something I saw some there
[10:32] there are some sort of movies on on
[10:33] YouTube also some people that are like
[10:35] just trying there to be also filmmaker
[10:38] there and just posted it there um uh
[10:40] what are the different FS on how do how
[10:43] do they different how do you see um a
[10:46] YouTube YouTuber versus like a filmmaker
[10:49] how would you define that so so super
[10:52] good question um I try to boil it down
[10:55] to where's the money coming from uh
[10:58] who's who's paying you um and so I I
[11:01] asked the question like what's the
[11:03] difference between art and
[11:04] propaganda and I think the answer to
[11:07] that is like where the money is coming
[11:08] from who's paying you um you know
[11:11] ad-based platforms particularly YouTube
[11:15] uh we already we're all well aware that
[11:16] you run into major censorship issues
[11:18] there um if advertisers don't want to be
[11:22] associated with a particular ideology or
[11:24] whatever um you know they can they can
[11:26] demonetize that they have outsized uh
[11:29] they have outsides control over that so
[11:32] you know in my opinion it's really about
[11:34] it really comes down to that Financial
[11:36] relationship between artist and audience
[11:38] member um and if we can remove as many
[11:42] people uh from you know the middle of
[11:44] that relationship as possible then you
[11:47] know I think we've done our job so you
[11:49] know I there's a there's a lot of
[11:51] differences between you know making a
[11:53] movie and you know just having a podcast
[11:56] for instance um you know the business of
[11:58] a movie movie is vastly more complex uh
[12:02] you have you know you know not only are
[12:05] you hiring potentially hundreds of
[12:07] people you have you know you're dealing
[12:09] with labor you're dealing with contracts
[12:11] you're dealing with
[12:12] licensing um you know it's a it's a
[12:15] sophisticated complicated uh business
[12:17] model so you know I just I don't I don't
[12:20] know that YouTube is the right venue
[12:22] from an advertising perspective you know
[12:24] you you're you're working for their
[12:25] algorithm you're working for you're
[12:28] trying to game their system that they've
[12:30] created in order to sell their own
[12:33] services to advertisers and I think that
[12:35] um you know yeah I think the primary
[12:38] difference is where that money is coming
[12:39] from it's a good one yeah and also like
[12:42] I'm I'm a a solo podcast and I can put
[12:45] out one podcast a day would be probably
[12:47] really hard for me to put out the movie
[12:49] a
[12:50] day as a single
[12:52] person I think that there there's some
[12:56] major difference there uh really cool um
[12:59] do you think that's uh
[13:01] changes do do you think that change what
[13:03] you're doing is uh a little bit because
[13:06] of Bitcoin or or would that happen
[13:08] anyways or is is is the money that we
[13:11] use um a factor in there yeah I I think
[13:15] that it is I think that um you know just
[13:18] just from the low value perspective
[13:20] right like let's say on Indie Hub we can
[13:22] make payments that fractions of a penny
[13:24] you know regularly multiple times a
[13:27] minute um you it's hard to do that on
[13:30] stripe you're not going to do that on
[13:32] acch Rails um you know and so when that
[13:35] friction gets introduced you you end up
[13:38] with a lot of companies who are in
[13:40] between it right like stripe might say
[13:42] hey I don't I don't I don't like what's
[13:43] going on on Indie Hub I think that you
[13:45] guys are doing things that are illegal
[13:47] or that the government's going to say
[13:48] hey we'll we'll shut you down so there's
[13:49] just these little Gatekeepers that get
[13:51] in the way of that flow of uh that
[13:54] relationship um and I think that that's
[13:58] that's ultim what muddies the waters the
[14:00] most and and you just end up with this
[14:02] very very slow very very high friction
[14:04] environment
[14:06] um so I think that I do I think that I
[14:10] think that Bitcoin has is going to have
[14:12] a huge impact um on the business models
[14:14] you know moving forward um I think that
[14:17] we're going to continue to see a
[14:20] decentralization of uh voices and
[14:23] product and opinions and I I think
[14:26] that's a great thing I think that's a
[14:27] good thing um you know I think from an
[14:30] from an art perspective you know the job
[14:33] of an artist in my opinion is to really
[14:35] ride that line of Consciousness between
[14:37] you know Order and Chaos and they bring
[14:39] things in um and reflect onto Society
[14:43] what it is that they see and we reward
[14:45] the best artists uh for doing so you
[14:48] know and and there's a there's a direct
[14:50] relationship between artists and
[14:52] filmmakers in this uh in this case and
[14:56] um for for Consciousness to to move
[14:58] forward that you know the resolution of
[15:01] that reflection has to be as high
[15:02] quality as possible um I don't know if
[15:05] that answered the question it kind of
[15:07] went on a rant there
[15:09] but I I I love rants it's it's fasc I
[15:12] had the longest probably I don't know if
[15:14] it's a record but uh there was one guy
[15:17] and I mentioned that a lot um he he was
[15:20] uh writing Bitcoin 21 million times he
[15:23] tries to write Bitcoin down on paper 21
[15:25] million times I think he's now at like
[15:27] 400,000 or something like that and he
[15:29] documents everything on Twitter and
[15:30] stuff like that and I was like hey I I
[15:32] have to have him on I just want to ask
[15:34] him why he's doing that and then let's
[15:36] see if there's a conversation but I
[15:38] actually just asked him that one
[15:39] question and he went on to a 55 minute
[15:43] rant
[15:45] like
[15:47] uninterrupted uh and I just asked him
[15:49] the question and then he he talked for
[15:51] 55 minutes then I had like like 15
[15:54] minutes more where we had some dialogue
[15:56] there uh but it was really cool I didn't
[15:58] want to to interrupt him he really just
[16:01] was on a on a on a run there and was
[16:03] like hey let's let's let him run it's
[16:05] it's it's it's fun to he in the middle I
[16:09] forgot that I'm actually a podcast host
[16:11] but was his name Michael
[16:13] [Laughter]
[16:15] sailor king of no Michael let me talk
[16:20] even a little bit more like I think we
[16:23] went on for one and a half hours uh and
[16:27] I got to ask like six questions or
[16:29] something like that
[16:30] so that's that was almost good I feel
[16:33] like that's a record for
[16:36] sailor he just goes man I love it he
[16:39] just goes yeah that that's true that's
[16:41] true uh by the way how how did you find
[16:44] your your way in bitco
[16:46] um excuse me sorry about that um so a
[16:50] buddy of mine in
[16:54] 2017 like had been bugging me about
[16:56] ethereum mining I don't I don't know why
[16:58] you know I think he was just interested
[17:01] in the tech and had some gpus lying
[17:03] around and was like I you know he could
[17:04] make some money mining ethereum or
[17:06] whatever um and he hit me up he he'
[17:09] asked me about it a few times and I was
[17:11] just busy and and had absolutely no way
[17:14] of really diving into it and um one of
[17:17] the days that he called me I just
[17:19] literally was sitting in my office I had
[17:20] absolutely nothing to do and uh you know
[17:24] he told me to go look into ethereum and
[17:26] Mining and all that so I I mean I just
[17:29] did a little Google search I ended up on
[17:31] coin market cap this is probably like
[17:33] March or something March April of
[17:35] 2017 and uh you know I honestly within
[17:39] probably 45 minutes maybe less than an
[17:41] hour uh I
[17:44] I I understood the basic concept of
[17:47] being able to have a you know a
[17:49] counterparty free peer-to-peer transfer
[17:52] value and I was like wow that's that's
[17:55] massive this is this is huge uh uh I I
[18:00] didn't I didn't know anything about any
[18:04] of the tech at all I mean I you know
[18:06] none at all so I was just like I don't I
[18:07] don't know what these thousands of coins
[18:09] are I couldn't have told you the
[18:10] difference between Bitcoin or ethereum
[18:11] or uh xrp or any of it at the time uh so
[18:16] I just I just kind of dived in I tried
[18:18] to start buying whatever I could and you
[18:21] know sat did did the [ __ ] coining for a
[18:23] while and um I I really became obsessed
[18:26] man I I I I spent an outsized amount of
[18:30] time for years I mean to this day
[18:32] honestly um paying attention to the tech
[18:34] and the space and um it took
[18:37] me it took me probably two years of real
[18:42] research and um really just diving into
[18:45] obscure books I mean I my career was in
[18:48] film and TV you know I didn't have any
[18:50] real um understanding of like
[18:53] sophisticated Financial Plumbing or
[18:54] treasuries or how money was created or
[18:56] anything like that and
[18:59] uh you know I would say by about 2019 I
[19:02] started to understand the value prop of
[19:05] Bitcoin uh you know better than I had
[19:08] and one of the things that did it for me
[19:11] was uh I had started building a proof of
[19:14] concept of Indie Hub years ago and at
[19:17] that time we were building it on a on
[19:19] inner Ledger which was developed um by
[19:23] this guy Stefon Thomas who was one of
[19:24] the one of the founders and worked at
[19:27] Ripple
[19:28] um and it was great like I need that big
[19:32] jug of water you got man and uh so uh at
[19:37] the time you know this was you know it
[19:40] it worked in a similar way to lightning
[19:42] you know you opened up essentially a
[19:43] private payment Channel you could do
[19:45] 50,000 transactions a second per Channel
[19:47] or whatever it was you know basically
[19:49] free um and then you kind of settled on
[19:51] chain it was it was it was a similar uh
[19:54] makeup but lightning at that time um you
[19:57] know was not as developed at all
[20:00] compared to what it is now and so we
[20:02] used interledger and it worked great you
[20:04] know it was you know stream watch a
[20:06] movie stream of payment uh fractions of
[20:08] you know micro payments tiny every
[20:10] second uh it was great it worked great
[20:13] but when I tried
[20:15] to get into the like oh I'm going to run
[20:18] a node you know how can how can Indie
[20:20] Hub you know run a node on this and run
[20:22] this software I realized it was like
[20:24] basically impossible uh you needed to be
[20:28] you know have have an incredible amount
[20:30] of experience in it and just crazy
[20:33] amounts of bandwidth and servers with
[20:34] SSD I mean it would have been tens of
[20:36] thousands of dollars a month like it was
[20:37] just totally nuts and it was pretty much
[20:41] in that moment that I I realized what
[20:43] bitcoiners had been saying the value of
[20:45] having these small nodes that anybody
[20:47] could run that didn't cost anything um
[20:50] so that was it was kind of like my own
[20:52] experience of just diving into it
[20:54] realizing the importance of having a
[20:57] cheap node that anybody could run
[20:59] uh and
[21:01] then uh it
[21:03] was it was another couple of years
[21:06] of just deep deep research um you know
[21:10] there were there were a
[21:12] few there were a few articles and a few
[21:14] things that really were I mean it was
[21:17] ever there was a ton of information but
[21:19] there were a few things that were just
[21:21] especially pivotal in my understanding
[21:23] of uh the value prop of Bitcoin um breed
[21:28] article uh the number zero in Bitcoin
[21:32] was one of them GG had this article
[21:35] Bitcoin is time um uh John valis did
[21:40] this article called money
[21:42] Messiah and those
[21:45] articles I I mean they just absolutely
[21:48] [ __ ] blew my mind they just blew my
[21:50] mind I I mean I just read them like
[21:52] multiple times and they started to
[21:54] rewire my brain in ways that I just
[21:57] hadn't thought about the world
[21:59] uh particularly with regards to energy
[22:02] um you know in GG's article Bitcoin is
[22:03] time got me into like okay I I I don't
[22:07] understand I got to try to understand
[22:09] what time is from a from a physics
[22:10] perspective um and I would say that you
[22:14] know entropy learning what entropy was
[22:17] just the basic concept of that um and
[22:20] how the Bitcoin uh time chain works and
[22:23] creates its own time um those were those
[22:27] were some of the major major PS
[22:28] Pinnacles for me it was like I had to
[22:31] get I had I had to just like develop a
[22:32] better relationship with physics um and
[22:35] uh you know again it was a lot of
[22:37] different things but but those in
[22:38] particular really really really had an
[22:40] outsized impact on my understanding of
[22:42] it
[22:43] and and and then you know then I ended
[22:46] up reading a bunch of really obscure
[22:48] stuff like there was this really really
[22:51] good interview on real Vision um kind of
[22:54] early real Vision days uh with Warren
[22:56] Mosler and he and he talked about gave a
[22:59] really really good description of how
[23:02] Financial the financial Plumbing works I
[23:03] mean the guy just completely understands
[23:05] it and um that got me into all of these
[23:08] other ridiculously obscure books Warren
[23:10] mosa wrote this book called Soft
[23:11] currency economics 2 I think he did one
[23:14] or there was a a version two um that I
[23:17] had to like trudge through that just
[23:19] totally you know opened my mind to how
[23:22] our financial markets worked um you know
[23:26] I kind of got deep into the mmt stuff I
[23:28] started reading reading like Stephanie
[23:30] kelton's books and just just to
[23:33] understand the plumbing of the system um
[23:35] so once I had kind of like the physics
[23:37] aspect of it sort of grasp and then the
[23:40] financial Plumbing aspect of it grasp um
[23:44] things really really really started to
[23:45] click and then and then Co hit you know
[23:48] and it was like here's the proof like
[23:50] they're going to print $6 trillion
[23:52] dollars was like oh my God what is going
[23:55] on um you know by by early 2020 I had
[23:59] pretty much
[24:01] already just moved my my um my my under
[24:05] my heart was with Bitcoin let's say um
[24:08] and then as the co debacle played out I
[24:11] it just kind of proved the whole thesis
[24:13] and I was like wow okay so then I I
[24:15] basically just got out of everything
[24:17] else that I was holding on to out of
[24:19] basically just a lack of understanding
[24:20] and fear um kind of the like I'm going
[24:23] to diversify because I don't really know
[24:25] anything um you know it was that classic
[24:27] chart right like under understanding of
[24:28] Bitcoin allocation of Bitcoin straight
[24:31] up um and
[24:34] so uh I was still developing Indie Hub
[24:36] at the time and and and I kind of just
[24:38] made a a bet and I was like I hope that
[24:40] lightning is as developed as I need it
[24:41] to be because I need somebody to just
[24:43] create a product that I can plug into
[24:44] I'm not trying to run a money
[24:46] transmission business it's not I have no
[24:48] interest in running nodes you know and
[24:50] doing anything like that that's not my
[24:52] business and it kind of just like lined
[24:54] up perfectly uh some companies started
[24:56] offering uh lightning services
[24:59] um and and that was kind of it man it
[25:02] just that was it was like I I understand
[25:04] this I understand why we're doing this
[25:06] um it's kind of No Going Back super
[25:08] interesting um it's also interesting how
[25:12] this transition is going um I asked that
[25:15] question a lot because I really want to
[25:18] grasp how Bitcoin will transform Society
[25:21] in a in a lot of ways uh and that's why
[25:23] I'm interested in like how people fought
[25:26] before Bitcoin and how people think
[25:28] after Bitcoin uh and a lot of things I
[25:32] think have to do because we in an early
[25:34] crowd and we also get impacted by that
[25:38] early uh and we are small community and
[25:41] and we have like this group thinking a
[25:43] little bit in there even though we get
[25:46] way bigger uh these days but I do think
[25:49] money has an impact on our thinking on
[25:53] our incentives and will change something
[25:55] in society so that's why I ask
[25:58] uh in what way did Bitcoin change your
[26:01] perspective on wealth and time super
[26:04] good
[26:05] question for me I think I I think I fit
[26:08] into the category that a lot of people
[26:10] fit into which is that um you know I I
[26:13] was
[26:14] raised
[26:16] um with fairly simple principles you
[26:20] know just sort of ethics and morals you
[26:21] know work hard save your money do right
[26:25] by um the people that you work with you
[26:28] know your word is your bond trust um
[26:33] and as
[26:35] I you know the first part of my you know
[26:39] professional career I I was I was just
[26:42] an actor and I had um I don't want to
[26:44] downplay that it is important but I had
[26:47] I would say like negative respect for
[26:50] finances or money um I I really ju I
[26:54] mean I just had I had no idea I had
[26:56] absolutely no idea how any of this
[26:57] worked and as I started to switch over
[27:01] to the production side of things I
[27:02] started to run my own businesses and I
[27:04] started hiring people and I started uh
[27:07] you know on my business
[27:10] journey and what happened to me was I
[27:13] started to realize that I was trying to
[27:16] do business the right
[27:19] way uh you know treat people fairly be
[27:23] honest
[27:25] um you know do things in a in a
[27:28] respectable Manner and I realized that I
[27:31] was not incentivized to do that um from
[27:35] a regulatory perspective like it was it
[27:37] was the government that was getting in
[27:39] the way um and that was basically
[27:42] forcing me to behave in a way that was
[27:44] against the interests of myself the
[27:46] people I was working with and my
[27:48] customers um and
[27:51] so I just had this like General
[27:54] frustration and general sense that like
[27:57] this isn't this doesn't make any sense
[27:59] like this isn't how things should be um
[28:01] this isn't how my family was brought up
[28:04] this isn't how they operated in their
[28:07] life you know
[28:09] and uh but it wasn't anchored to any
[28:12] kind of functional understanding it was
[28:13] just like this growing frustration that
[28:15] that that the incentive structures just
[28:18] seem totally perverse and
[28:20] corrupt um and so I guess what I'm what
[28:24] I'm trying to get at is that I think
[28:26] that Bitcoin brings us back to to what
[28:28] we all sort of innately understand at
[28:31] this like base layer of relationship and
[28:34] behavior and and how we conduct
[28:36] ourselves and how important it is and
[28:38] necessary it is for human beings to
[28:40] cooperate at scale um and when people
[28:44] are in the middle of you cooperating it
[28:46] just you know there's just a massively
[28:48] negative result um and
[28:52] so you know I Bitcoin just came in and
[28:55] it was like yes this is yes this is how
[28:57] it should be
[28:58] like this is this is how I was raised
[29:00] for things to to uh how the structure
[29:05] was you know implied in my
[29:08] upbringing and so for me it was like it
[29:13] I wouldn't say that it changed my
[29:16] behavior I would say that it reverted my
[29:18] behavior back to what I just innately
[29:21] and instinctually thought it should have
[29:23] been in the first place um particularly
[29:26] as an American you know like we we have
[29:29] a strong sense of individualism and you
[29:32] know I don't really have any interest in
[29:34] being told what to do and I'm going to
[29:35] take my risks and I should get the
[29:37] reward for taking that risk and um you
[29:41] know I I think that I think that just I
[29:43] I just think that Bitcoin is like a
[29:44] little bit closer to natural law in that
[29:47] in that respect um and so I do I I think
[29:50] that I think that Bitcoin is going to
[29:52] have a massive and profound impact on
[29:55] human behavior and I think that it I
[29:57] think that is going to kind of reset us
[29:58] back to where we our natural our more
[30:01] natural state if that makes sense it
[30:04] makes total sense and it's a funny for
[30:06] me because uh sometimes I talk with
[30:08] people outside of Bitcoin and when I
[30:10] come at that angle of like oh yeah
[30:12] Bitcoin will bring us back to how nature
[30:15] actually wanted to be and nature
[30:17] actually wanted us to have
[30:20] money from an outside perspective it's
[30:22] really hard to understand that because
[30:24] it's like a highly technical thing uh
[30:27] you need computer just to run it you
[30:29] need all those uh fancy things your
[30:31] wallets your your things like it's it
[30:34] seems not true and but then you
[30:38] understand okay yeah like we cannot use
[30:40] something directly from nature as money
[30:43] uh so we kind of translate Nature's
[30:46] energy with the proof of work algorithm
[30:49] into something digital so I can also
[30:52] send this across the ocean uh and to
[30:55] someone else to actually use it because
[30:57] otherwise it it's not going to work
[30:59] anyways in a globalized digitalized
[31:02] world where uh people from America work
[31:04] with people from Asia and they work with
[31:07] people from Austria again so this is
[31:10] something that we need we will never go
[31:13] back to something not digital and I
[31:16] rather have a digital Bitcoin than a
[31:18] digital
[31:19] Euro or some digital xrb or something
[31:22] like that so in that sense it's the it's
[31:25] the most most natural way of money ever
[31:29] invented and so it's a hard hard thing
[31:31] to understand but I think once you're
[31:34] there it kind of makes sense in in that
[31:37] sense yeah very cool yeah absolutely and
[31:40] like you know I when I'm when I'm in the
[31:43] process of of like explaining Bitcoin or
[31:45] I'm orange pilling people um you know I
[31:49] I realize I have to go back most of the
[31:51] time to my to where I started which was
[31:54] Zero you know I no idea of no real
[31:57] concept of money as a tool or a
[31:59] technology it was just something that
[32:00] was assumed
[32:03] um and you know I have to just start at
[32:07] the very very Basics
[32:10] and generally speaking in those
[32:13] conversations the presupposition that
[32:15] people have is like that the money
[32:18] should hold some value they they assume
[32:20] that it does but haven't put a ton of
[32:21] thought into it um and that we should be
[32:25] able to transact without asking
[32:28] permission to transact you know I I'm a
[32:31] big believer in the idea that uh the
[32:34] freedom to transact is is as important
[32:36] if not more important than freedom of
[32:38] speech um you know actions speak louder
[32:41] than words and uh you know how we
[32:44] express ourselves behaviorally using
[32:48] money as a tool is um you know in a on a
[32:53] planet of 8 billion people probably the
[32:55] most important tool that all of us use
[32:58] collectively I I just don't think that
[32:59] there's anything more important than
[33:01] that tool um and if that
[33:04] expression um is is distorted or
[33:08] perverted or augmented based on the
[33:11] whims of somebody else then then then
[33:14] humans don't get to iterate in as
[33:16] quickly as we need to in order to
[33:18] progress and so we just end up being
[33:20] totally hamstrung and stuck you know and
[33:23] and that's no good like we got to we
[33:25] can't be stuck we have to move forward
[33:27] you know like we can't we can't energy
[33:29] has to move man it really does I even go
[33:32] one step further I feel like uh the
[33:34] freedom from transact and the freedom of
[33:37] of money moving is for me freedom of
[33:40] speech in in a way because freedom of
[33:43] speech means uh for me uh the freedom to
[33:45] communicate whatever I want and I if I
[33:48] cannot communicate to someone else my
[33:50] financial energy freedom of speech is
[33:52] actually um challenged in in in that way
[33:56] so if if my B says heyy uh you cannot
[34:01] transfer that money to to that person uh
[34:04] because that person might be bad uh and
[34:07] even if they are right they violate my
[34:11] right of freedom of speech in in my
[34:13] sense in my in my understanding maybe
[34:15] maybe that goes too far or maybe that
[34:17] this different it's a weird uh way of
[34:20] thinking of freedom of speech but that
[34:22] that's at least how I look at it yeah I
[34:24] I mean I I totally agree um you you know
[34:28] I kind of a separate tangent here but I
[34:29] one of the I I would say you know
[34:31] Bitcoin led me on a spiritual path and a
[34:35] spiritual journey as well and there's um
[34:39] I I was not aware I I was not personally
[34:43] aware at all of how much fear um
[34:48] dictates a a a a an outsized amount of
[34:52] human behavior um until Co hit when Co
[34:55] hit I just I had just
[34:58] I don't generally don't live my life
[35:00] operating at that frequency and um when
[35:04] Co hit and I started to see the
[35:05] destruction that was Downstream of
[35:08] making decisions out of fear um it
[35:12] really a lot of light bulbs went off for
[35:13] me um and I and I realized that fear
[35:17] from a from a vibrational perspective is
[35:20] essentially the it's the vibration of
[35:22] Destruction um you know I I looked at my
[35:25] life and I looked at the choices that
[35:26] I'd made and and I and I realized pretty
[35:28] much unequivocally that all the best
[35:30] decisions and all of the best work and
[35:32] all of the best relationships I'd ever
[35:33] had were uh rooted in love and um all of
[35:37] the worst decisions I'd ever made were
[35:39] rooted in fear and when my life was uh
[35:42] you know on a downward trajectory let's
[35:45] say um it was almost always because I
[35:47] was I was operating out of a place of
[35:49] fear the the reason I say that is
[35:51] because I I um there's a I I I suppose
[35:56] there's a strong case to be made for
[35:58] trying you know control comes from Fear
[36:02] a lot of the time I mean I think there's
[36:03] there's just people who are legitimately
[36:06] evil there's sociopathic U that's kind
[36:10] of a different topic but I think a lot
[36:12] of people uh if you're operating from a
[36:15] place of fear you can you start to try
[36:16] to control things and you start to try
[36:18] to control behavior and you start to try
[36:19] to control how people think and I I
[36:23] think that in the long run uh that's
[36:27] just it's it's just net negative um you
[36:29] know there's this Jason
[36:32] Lowry um I think it was Lowry in in
[36:37] either a one of his posts or podcasts or
[36:39] his book maybe all of them uh he made
[36:42] this really really crazy point that
[36:44] stuck with me man and this just like
[36:46] this will never leave me and he
[36:48] basically said that at the Battle of
[36:51] Gettysburg um when they went to collect
[36:54] the bodies and the weapons and clean up
[36:56] the battlefield
[36:58] they they realized that some insanely
[37:02] large percentage of the guns hadn't even
[37:04] been fired and furthermore a lot of the
[37:08] guns had two or three uh balls of
[37:12] ammunition you know shoved into their
[37:14] musket which suggests that not only were
[37:16] people not firing their weapon but they
[37:20] were pretending to fire their weapon
[37:22] they were pretending to shoot and they
[37:23] were pretending to reload and you know
[37:26] the implication of that in my mind is
[37:28] that the overwhelming majority of people
[37:31] are
[37:32] not like our base state is not violent
[37:35] and aggressive like at a at a at the
[37:38] core base layer of our brain we
[37:41] understand how important it is to be
[37:42] peaceful and to
[37:44] cooperate
[37:46] and I for us to progress it it has to be
[37:51] in a peaceful way it has to be in a
[37:53] creative way it cannot be in a
[37:54] destructive way um now now and
[37:57] destruction certainly has its place uh
[38:00] you know things need to be uh you know
[38:03] destroyed in order to be built back up
[38:05] like it's just part of the process but
[38:07] um you know this this fear that people
[38:10] are going to oh they're going to
[38:11] transact they're going to do things I
[38:13] don't like them to do or whatever um
[38:17] that's just it's it's just that it's
[38:18] just fear um and if I I fundamentally
[38:21] believe I'm not cynical in this regard
[38:23] that if if humans have the opportunity
[38:25] to uh trans act freely uh we will see
[38:30] just an unfathomable amount of Positive
[38:32] Growth and then of course there's
[38:33] there's insane people and there's
[38:35] there's disgusting things that happen
[38:37] there's no question about that but I
[38:38] think that uh being controlling and
[38:42] trying to control transactions I think
[38:44] leads to more uh more behavior that is
[38:48] you know just frankly not in line with
[38:51] uh kind of the base the base layer of
[38:53] being a human being if you watch or
[38:56] listen to my my podcast on a regular
[38:58] basis I'll guess you already bought some
[39:01] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[39:03] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[39:07] in a hardware wallet my personal

[40:14] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[40:18] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[40:21] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[40:24] look at that beauty I love it so much
[40:26] coin Vig land made and perfect Bitcoin
[40:30] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[40:32] way to go out there and show that you
[40:35] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[40:38] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[40:41] dropped a completely new an amazing
[40:44] Genesis edition of their watch
[40:47] collections you have the date of the
[40:49] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[40:52] and of course also the block height and
[40:55] which EPO we are current in I love the
[40:58] level of detail they put in in this
[41:01] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[41:03] those amazing coin V the time pieces
[41:07] down in the descriptions I love those
[41:09] watches so so much I mean it it comes
[41:13] down to any to every invention ever made
[41:17] like you can say the same thing about
[41:20] fire about knives about gunpowder about
[41:24] everything there is always
[41:27] if you justify not allowing Innovation
[41:30] to prosper because uh 1% of the
[41:34] population might abuse it for something
[41:37] bad that's that's always a really bad
[41:40] that's always a really bad ankle uh and
[41:43] so uh of course criminals will use
[41:46] Bitcoin because everyone will use
[41:49] Bitcoin so of course criminals use uh
[41:52] knives but I still like knives to cut my
[41:54] onions
[41:57] I I don't I don't want to squee them so
[42:00] like it it's it's for me really
[42:02] interesting how how people look at that
[42:04] and and I really like how electricity
[42:07] got adopted uh and there you see those
[42:10] old Comics that were painted where we
[42:13] like oh they made propaganda against
[42:16] electricity because they thought it will
[42:18] be really bad and the whole world will
[42:21] goes down a really bad Lane but now a
[42:25] world without electricity and I'm aware
[42:28] that there are Parts in the world where
[42:29] actually people live completely without
[42:31] electricity and that part of the world
[42:33] is not even that small um but uh in
[42:37] everyone that is listening right now uh
[42:40] their Liv is probably really complicated
[42:42] if they have tomorrow no electricity
[42:45] anymore yeah not not negative dude like
[42:49] and from an energetic perspective right
[42:50] this is this is one of the things I
[42:53] started to be able to see the world more
[42:55] from an energetic perspective right like
[42:56] you can't create energ you can't destroy
[42:57] energy we can transmute which is
[42:59] incredible right like we're like Wizards
[43:02] in that respect you know we can we can
[43:03] take what's here and we can rework it
[43:05] into something else and that's kind of
[43:06] the base layer but like um you know
[43:09] there was this uh uh really good Ted
[43:13] Talk um uh I think it was I think it was
[43:16] beray brown uh in one of her TED talks
[43:18] and she talks about she was trying to
[43:20] find she was doing research about uh you
[43:24] know people who
[43:27] have meaning in their life you know
[43:28] basically and long it's a great Ted Talk
[43:31] highly recommend go check it out but
[43:32] from an energetic perspective
[43:33] essentially what she found out was that
[43:35] you can't take away the highs you can't
[43:38] take away the lows sorry and and still
[43:41] have the highs you if if you take away
[43:44] one you compress you know our our
[43:46] energetic reality to this like middle
[43:48] band of of uh you know you give somebody
[43:52] anti-depressants and you're also cutting
[43:54] off their happiness at the same time
[43:55] they're maybe they're not as depressed
[43:56] but they're not as happy and so you you
[43:59] try to start manipulating how energy
[44:01] works and it's going to squirt out
[44:02] somewhere else like it just there's no
[44:04] there's no way around it um you know and
[44:08] we we we we have to have some element of
[44:13] trust and faith and love in order to
[44:15] continue to move forward without any
[44:17] guarantee of safety um you know but But
[44:21] the irony is the more the more of a
[44:23] guarantee of safety you're looking for
[44:25] the less safe you become you know I
[44:27] think it's kind of how I see it% and I
[44:29] talked about about that on the podcast
[44:31] already but for me volatility is
[44:33] vitility like you you need uh that to to
[44:37] make uh noise and there will come a
[44:40] point where Bitcoin is super boring
[44:42] where where Bitcoin is just like
[44:43] everyone has Bitcoin it is this thing
[44:46] that like yeah it's really big news if
[44:48] it shoots up 1.7% in a year in
[44:51] purchasing power uh because then it's
[44:53] like oh what happened this year like
[44:55] it's it's that would be huge news if if
[44:57] Bitcoin moves more than 1% or in that
[45:01] scenario Bitcoin is actually the thing
[45:03] that we are measuring everything in so
[45:06] uh it's it's more like uh it's it's it's
[45:08] massive if prices move down more than 1%
[45:11] or something like that so like that
[45:13] that's I think more the way to to think
[45:15] about that but at that point I will find
[45:17] something else to talk about I I I I
[45:21] will not I will not um talk about
[45:23] Bitcoin when it's boring so till it's uh
[45:26] till it's not boring and I think the
[45:28] next like 10 years I guess will
[45:30] definitely not be boring in Bitcoin uh
[45:33] but at some point it will get boring and
[45:35] then I'm like yeah let's let's let's
[45:36] find something else that I'm passionate
[45:38] about yeah like 100% you know we get
[45:41] back to what we should be doing here
[45:42] which is uh you know getting more
[45:44] efficient at things getting better at
[45:46] producing things uh being more creative
[45:48] you know I mean human beings like I say
[45:50] we're we're Wizards we have this
[45:51] incredible ability to transmute energy
[45:54] um and I think that that's in service of
[45:55] something I think that I think that we
[45:58] have uh you know part of our job here is
[46:02] to sort of solve for entropy and uh make
[46:05] things make sure that that that this
[46:07] party doesn't end any sooner than it has
[46:09] to you know what I mean so you know in
[46:12] that case if bitcoin's going up let's
[46:15] say 2% a year well that's great that
[46:17] means that we got 2% better at at uh
[46:20] doing whatever it is that we need to be
[46:22] doing you know and that should be
[46:23] celebrated absolutely that's uh that's
[46:26] also uh just a side note I think that's
[46:28] what a lot of people don't get about
[46:30] inflation even if we saying CPI is
[46:33] actually inflation which I completely
[46:34] disagree with we are measuring from zero
[46:37] and we should be measuring from where we
[46:40] have a productivity gain because we are
[46:42] getting more efficient in doing stuff so
[46:44] like even if inflation is just 7% in
[46:47] reality we should not measure it from
[46:49] zero we should measure it from like
[46:50] minus 10% and then inflation is like 27%
[46:53] or something like that uh but then
[46:59] we you get it right it's that it's that
[47:03] um um Jeff boof um I think uh really
[47:07] made that concept popular and and I
[47:10] think it's such a genius way to think
[47:12] about when Jeff poof told me that I was
[47:15] I was mind blown to be honest like that
[47:17] when I heard about the prize of tomorrow
[47:19] and how he un explained it I was like
[47:22] that's so simple why I did not think
[47:24] about that at all in my
[47:27] whole years of studying money and
[47:30] investing in stocks and and doing all
[47:31] this things like I felt really stupid in
[47:33] that moment yeah you
[47:36] know I think it goes I think that that
[47:38] goes back to the point we were making
[47:41] earlier which is that we all just have
[47:43] this base level of understanding that
[47:46] that which is Jeff Jeff's point of
[47:49] things should be getting cheaper over
[47:51] time like all of the complexity that we
[47:53] have to learn like if I'm orange pilling
[47:55] somebody like all of this cial
[47:57] complexity is really the work isn't in
[48:00] saying hey uh which is you know things
[48:04] should be getting cheaper over time we
[48:05] should be getting better at
[48:06] manufacturing things uh that's a simple
[48:08] concept like we all understand that
[48:10] intuitively that the challenge is in
[48:12] having to explain how the system
[48:15] currently is because it's it's
[48:17] fraudulent and so we have to explain how
[48:20] and why it's fraudulent you have to
[48:22] rewire the brain expose the lie so that
[48:25] people can go back to appreciating what
[48:27] their their base assumption was in the
[48:28] first place you know like I one of the
[48:32] one of the things that I like to one of
[48:34] the examples that I like to use for
[48:36] people
[48:37] um if they have a house if they have a
[48:40] mortgage um and I say look okay your
[48:43] house over the last whatever 10 years is
[48:45] up
[48:46] 50% can you sell that house in the same
[48:50] neighborhood and buy a bigger house in
[48:53] that neighborhood and of course the
[48:55] answer is no and so I go are you
[48:57] actually richer in in in that
[49:01] context like no I guess not you know now
[49:04] obviously that only holds up in like a
[49:06] localized neighborhood you know if
[49:07] you're moving somewhere else but but I
[49:09] mean even like us real estate prices
[49:11] they just in aggregate they just riding
[49:13] this wave of money um and uh you know
[49:17] that that tends to click with people
[49:18] they go oh yeah I guess I can't buy a
[49:20] bigger house so it's nominally it went
[49:22] up real terms it went down and then they
[49:25] can that's a good way to kind of get
[49:26] into the nominal versus Real uh
[49:29] discussion and debate but anyway I I
[49:32] just it it doesn't have to be this
[49:34] complicated the only reason it's
[49:35] complicated is because the rules are
[49:37] insane and you know we have to like
[49:39] expose the insanity yeah it's also
[49:42] interesting and people are like oh
[49:43] Bitcoin is so complicated really explain
[49:45] me the Fe explain me the feat system
[49:48] please like I I still don't still don't
[49:50] get what's what's going on there uh yeah
[49:53] really interesting um another question
[49:55] that came up to me when when when you
[49:57] were talking about um violence um do you
[50:01] think that Bitcoin has a chance to limit
[50:03] or end Wars to to a certain extent I do
[50:07] um I definitely do
[50:11] um like I said I I
[50:16] the I had this I had this realization at
[50:19] one point you know and I'm free to feel
[50:21] free to critique me on this or call me
[50:24] an idiot or whatever but um you know you
[50:27] look at a situation right now I mean
[50:28] it's Global this the craziness is global
[50:30] right now for sure but let's say let's
[50:31] just look at the Middle East because
[50:33] it's especially crazy
[50:35] um you know in my opinion the natural
[50:40] state of things is is um beautiful it's
[50:45] peaceful it's
[50:46] balanced um and when things are as
[50:49] insane as they are particularly given
[50:52] that the overwhelming majority of people
[50:54] really don't want to pick up a gun and
[50:55] shoot somebody like we really don't you
[50:58] know like like we don't um I know
[51:00] there's people who are cynical who think
[51:02] that we're just sort of naturally
[51:03] violent and whatever I I just
[51:05] categorically disagree with that and so
[51:08] if things are as crazy as they are it's
[51:10] just it's antithetical to the Natural
[51:14] order of things and so in my mind it it
[51:16] just is very clear that when things are
[51:18] that disorderly it's by choice someone
[51:21] or something or some group of people is
[51:24] intentionally creating chaos and people
[51:27] against each other who would otherwise
[51:28] have no interest in fighting each other
[51:30] most people are just like I'll just go
[51:32] this way and we'll cooperate and
[51:34] whatever um we really don't want to get
[51:36] down to shooting each other in the face
[51:37] you know that's just not the natural
[51:38] state of people so um I I do and I think
[51:43] that when people have the freedom to
[51:44] transact and the freedom to opt out of a
[51:48] system that uh sort of forces them into
[51:51] violence which is kind of how I feel
[51:53] like a lot of this is going on um you
[51:56] know I I I do think that the potential
[51:59] is there that we're on the cusp of maybe
[52:00] the greatest economic period in all of
[52:04] human history um I I could be insane but
[52:08] it it makes sense to
[52:10] me it also makes sense for me the one
[52:13] thing that still doesn't make sense for
[52:15] me where I'm undecided is if we can get
[52:19] to that future peacefully I I get when
[52:22] once we have Bitcoin uh I think it will
[52:25] be more peaceful I think there will be
[52:27] still um sort like a form of War uh but
[52:32] I think it will be extremely limited and
[52:34] only Wars where the people actually want
[52:37] to fight them right now we have that
[52:38] weird thing where when the government
[52:40] says we are at War all of a sudden even
[52:42] if maybe just 10% of the population
[52:44] actually wants War 100% of the
[52:47] population is at War uh because they
[52:49] have the money printer and they can just
[52:51] like get the financial energy from it if
[52:53] you all of a sudden have to raise taxes
[52:55] for a war you have to explain it to
[52:57] everyone and uh most likely most people
[53:01] will disagree with that um if you at
[53:05] that future I think that will be really
[53:07] good for Wars and peace so like we will
[53:09] have way more peace than than any wars
[53:12] and if we have a war that's probably
[53:14] some war that actually makes sense to a
[53:16] certain group of people uh but I I have
[53:19] a hard time understanding if if we even
[53:21] have this but then there's human nature
[53:23] also involved in that but the one thing
[53:25] I have really hard uh hard time
[53:27] understanding if we come to that point
[53:30] from like now fear to then Bitcoin in a
[53:32] peaceful manner because there are those
[53:34] feed money printers that really want to
[53:37] protect uh their uh good status of like
[53:41] just having the money printer and with
[53:43] Bitcoin they don't have a money printer
[53:45] do do you think also that we could get
[53:48] to us to that stage to transition phase
[53:51] of of the hyperbitcoinization in a
[53:53] peaceful manner it's it I think that I
[53:56] think that's the question of the times I
[53:58] really do uh I think that that's kind of
[54:01] the only relevant question can we make
[54:03] this transition peacefully I think that
[54:05] it's possible do I think that it will
[54:07] definitely happen peacefully I don't
[54:08] know I would say
[54:10] 5050 um you
[54:13] know if
[54:15] you the way I kind of look at it is uh
[54:18] you know like cancer you know cancer is
[54:21] is you know unregulated cell growth
[54:24] right your body's not able to
[54:27] um use its natural processes to to kind
[54:30] of Slough off um toxic
[54:35] cells
[54:36] um you know I we could be going through
[54:40] this this period where it's kind of this
[54:43] one last gasp of um cancerous energy
[54:48] that we have to contend with you know on
[54:51] the one hand I think that in a lot of
[54:53] ways that'll be good for Bitcoin you
[54:55] know there's a lot of people who
[54:57] don't understand the value proposition
[55:00] of Bitcoin and I'm not sure that they
[55:01] will understand it until things get
[55:03] excruciating for them
[55:06] um so I I guess what I'm trying to say
[55:10] is that I I think it's possible that we
[55:12] can't get there without some level of
[55:14] violence but I at the same time I also
[55:17] think that that level of violence will
[55:19] be
[55:21] instrumental and necessary to get us to
[55:25] that next phase because you're going to
[55:26] have to convince a whole lot of people
[55:29] that there's an alternative that there's
[55:30] an exit and it doesn't have to be
[55:32] violence I mean to your point earlier
[55:34] like for most people violence is the
[55:37] absolute Last Choice uh that that you
[55:41] could possibly make like I don't I do
[55:43] not want to if there's a dispute I want
[55:45] to try to resolve it in any way
[55:47] conceivable uh unless it's absolutely
[55:49] necessary that I turn violent um so I I
[55:53] I don't in that situation like it it's
[55:55] kind of ridiculous to say like that's
[55:57] good for Bitcoin like it you know
[55:58] violence isn't good but I think that it
[56:01] could be the energetic thrust that you
[56:05] know the cancer sort of eats itself the
[56:07] host dies in this case you know kind of
[56:09] metaphorically Society goes like okay
[56:10] we're done with this for quite some time
[56:13] and it really is the final Catalyst to
[56:14] get us into this new world but I don't
[56:17] think that that's I I'm just saying I
[56:19] could see that I don't think that it's
[56:21] fundamentally necessary for us to do to
[56:23] get there um you know kind of maybe
[56:25] taking the other side of that argument
[56:27] is like if in my own perspective if
[56:29] people don't want to commit violence and
[56:32] there is this escape hatch um it's
[56:34] possible that even just the threat and
[56:36] the uncomfortable reality of violence
[56:39] will force them there before they ever
[56:40] turn violent and and maybe that uh
[56:43] stymies it before you know anything
[56:46] super Global pops off anyway um I I
[56:49] don't know I don't have a strong opinion
[56:51] about it I'm certainly not hoping for it
[56:53] I'm certainly not rooting for it you
[56:55] know in my my mind um I would like to
[56:58] see a slow orderly transition into this
[57:02] new world I I would rather see bitcoin's
[57:04] price go up slowly and consistently you
[57:08] know if it if it spikes to a million
[57:09] bucks in the next three years like I
[57:11] think that that's an indication like we
[57:12] have serious problems um and I'm not I'm
[57:16] not going to be rooting for that um you
[57:19] know I I I would rather it be slow and
[57:23] steady and peaceful one other aspect
[57:24] that I want to get into this
[57:26] conversation um is the the digital War
[57:30] that's going on that I participate in we
[57:34] have the the the the information uh
[57:38] cyber war that is going on between
[57:41] different Financial religions in in a
[57:44] sense where I uh I fight for Bitcoin
[57:49] online every day and try to like get
[57:51] across the message of sound money and
[57:53] and Bitcoin uh with the podcast with
[57:55] Twitter on Primal I mean on Primal
[57:58] probably most people on no most people
[58:01] are
[58:01] already kind of bitcoiners but uh that
[58:06] that's a a war aspect that not a lot of
[58:09] people see as a war maybe war is not the
[58:12] the best uh word also for that but it's
[58:15] it's kind of like you have those digital
[58:18] uh soldiers that fight and and
[58:19] information War because there's so much
[58:22] information out there and you can get
[58:25] down uh a complete fear route and there
[58:28] are a lot of uh let's call the word
[58:30] content creators out there the
[58:32] influencers however you want to call
[58:34] that they actually are completely in
[58:36] that fat world and they promote that
[58:37] field world oh buy an ETF you you do
[58:41] that you get there and yield and you do
[58:43] that so that's a whole another world but
[58:47] I don't like I I I'm on the other side
[58:49] like hey buy buying hold Bitcoin uh and
[58:53] it's it's it's kind of a a different War
[58:56] where we we fight digital about
[58:59] attention and I guess every subscriber
[59:01] every like every comment every
[59:04] engagement thing that you get more on
[59:06] the Bitcoin side is is kind of win for
[59:08] for for Bitcoin uh it's it's an
[59:10] interesting um I never really thought
[59:12] about it in that way but when you were
[59:14] explaining it I was like oh in in some
[59:17] sort I'm in in a digital War uh fighting
[59:20] for
[59:20] Bitcoin not not very brutally like like
[59:24] I I I respect everyone and we we don't
[59:27] Point guns at each other there are like
[59:30] debates even where we sit next to each
[59:32] other and and we we we don't even touch
[59:35] each other like we don't even fight each
[59:37] other any anyway physically uh but
[59:40] there's probably maybe that's that maybe
[59:43] that's the way how how Bitcoin will get
[59:45] adopted not with a physical violence but
[59:48] with like uh information
[59:50] vience in in a sense at least that what
[59:53] would I that's a word that I would get
[59:55] behind like digital information
[59:58] War I dude 100% uh we're in it man
[60:01] there's no question about that you know
[60:04] um I think that
[60:08] um you know kind of back to my early
[60:11] early point about creativity you know
[60:13] and human beings have this really
[60:14] interesting ability to like manifest you
[60:16] know the way I see things is like we
[60:18] have two we have two Realms we have I
[60:20] call it the acostic realm that's like a
[60:21] bad word for it but you got the realm of
[60:22] information and you've got the realm of
[60:24] physics um side note this is one of the
[60:27] things that's so [ __ ] mind-blowing
[60:30] about Bitcoin is that it's fusing these
[60:32] Realms it's fusing the information realm
[60:34] with the Physical Realm I mean once you
[60:36] connect the dots on that it's like it's
[60:38] just absolutely
[60:39] mindblowing um but I do
[60:43] see a lot of times when I I'm thinking
[60:46] about what's going on in the world I do
[60:48] see it as um uh we human beings are the
[60:53] physical manifestation of the war of
[60:56] ideas of the war of information that's
[60:57] kind of floating around um and we're
[61:00] we're expressing in the Physical Realm
[61:03] um what was manifested from the the
[61:06] akashic realm or the the the realm of
[61:09] information and ideas um so I I totally
[61:12] agree with that I think that we're
[61:13] absolutely in it um and that's fine like
[61:15] that's that's where human beings should
[61:17] stay we we have the ability to Hash
[61:19] things out uh without having to resort
[61:22] to physical violence um through things
[61:24] like debate you know the this this mind
[61:26] virus idea like that is Bitcoin and
[61:28] there's mind viruses that are you know
[61:30] more destructive and
[61:32] negative um but you know I I think that
[61:36] you
[61:37] can't you can't save everybody from
[61:40] themselves uh some people really really
[61:43] really need to know beyond a shadow of a
[61:46] doubt that the stove is super hot you
[61:48] know like you can't you can tell them
[61:50] all day long you could show somebody
[61:51] getting burned like it's not going to
[61:54] matter they have to know
[61:56] beyond a shadow of a doubt that the
[61:58] stove is hot and so I think in in those
[62:00] situations as bitcoiners the best we can
[62:03] do is just patiently be a beacon of
[62:06] light you know in in A Realm of Darkness
[62:09] and at some
[62:10] point if someone has the capability or
[62:13] the willingness uh to to open their eyes
[62:16] and recognize that there is light in
[62:19] this Cave of darkness and they go
[62:21] towards that light we just have to make
[62:23] sure that we represent that light as
[62:25] best as possible possible um you know uh
[62:30] welcoming uh kind
[62:32] loving
[62:34] um you know responsible people which I
[62:37] think is generally like the overwhelming
[62:39] some of the overwhelming characteristics
[62:40] of bitcoiners they're they're generally
[62:42] not cynical they're generally hopeful
[62:44] they're generally creative they're
[62:45] generally um this just great they're
[62:48] just great people so uh I guess what I'm
[62:50] trying to say is that you know to to try
[62:53] to win that war the best we can do is
[62:56] represent in the Physical Realm uh what
[62:59] that idea the best version of what that
[63:01] idea could look like and be like if that
[63:03] makes sense that absolutely makes sense
[63:06] I love also how you put it um as we
[63:09] already over one hour that that flew by
[63:12] really quickly um I have a few question
[63:14] that I really want to get into because
[63:15] you're from movie making um what are
[63:18] your favorite Bitcoin movies which
[63:21] aren't Bitcoin movies oh man uh hot
[63:26] um you know first of all I got plenty of
[63:29] time so if we got to keep going no rush
[63:33] um um there are there are a number of us
[63:37] uh
[63:39] filmmakers the Bitcoin filmmaker
[63:42] crossover group um who are generally
[63:46] very dissatisfied with uh the Bitcoin
[63:50] cinema world right now um you know a lot
[63:52] of the the the Bitcoin movies are
[63:55] they're just very factual uh you know
[63:57] they they just kind of get
[64:00] into uh these sort of myopic debates
[64:04] about the nature of money and things
[64:06] like that and that's great like that's
[64:08] that's fantastic but um most
[64:12] people's portal
[64:15] into um having some Revelation about
[64:18] something like this is going to be
[64:20] through um like superlative human
[64:23] experiences right there the stories that
[64:24] we tell over and over and over again and
[64:26] the way that we get into these stories
[64:28] and we we we have empathy for characters
[64:33] that are going through a human
[64:35] experience and uh you know all of that's
[64:39] to say that I think that I think that
[64:41] here in the future we're going to see a
[64:43] lot more movies that have these themes
[64:44] in them but put Bitcoin as like a
[64:46] secondary or tertiary sort of subplot um
[64:49] they need to be great movies first that
[64:52] are you know Universal um and
[64:55] well-crafted
[64:56] and Bitcoin needs to be something that
[64:58] uh people sort of come to you know
[65:00] accidentally I mean it when you're
[65:02] making a movie uh the people who do it
[65:06] the best you know it's a it's a highly
[65:08] sophisticated emotional manipulation
[65:10] machine you know like when you're making
[65:13] a movie you're you're you're aiming for
[65:15] certain beats you're looking for certain
[65:16] reactions you're you're crafting a
[65:18] particular emotional experience I mean
[65:19] that's your job and uh the people who do
[65:24] it the best are the ones that get an
[65:26] audience to come to those to to feel
[65:28] like they're coming to those conclusions
[65:30] on their own rather than those ideas
[65:32] being shoved down their throat um and so
[65:35] I think right now we're in this like
[65:36] very early phase of Bitcoin where it's
[65:38] just like a lot of a lot of factoids and
[65:41] information just sort of being shoved
[65:42] down people's throats but we haven't yet
[65:44] really hit uh like a worldclass
[65:48] Storyteller um you know using those
[65:51] themes so I guess the answer is I don't
[65:52] have one yet um we're kind of waiting
[65:56] you know hopefully I can be involved in
[65:57] some of those when they pop down the
[65:59] line um you know I it's sort of a copout
[66:04] answer I think also like some of the you
[66:06] know some of the great works of all time
[66:08] whether it's music or movies or fine art
[66:10] or whatever um that seek truth above all
[66:16] else you
[66:17] know that's a bitcoiner movie you know
[66:20] what I mean like like I am going
[66:24] to put my out in order to try to to seek
[66:27] a deeper truth or present a deeper truth
[66:31] um and
[66:32] so you know I I guess I guess what I'm
[66:35] saying in part of what I'm doing at
[66:36] Indie Hub is that if we can if we can
[66:40] reorient that relationship between
[66:42] filmmaker and audience member um we're
[66:45] going to see a lot more movies that feel
[66:48] like Bitcoin esque but really that's
[66:51] just that's just a function of artists
[66:53] being able to get rewarded and take risk
[66:55] and and and do their jobs in other words
[66:57] movies will get better over time they'll
[67:00] get more Universal they'll get more
[67:01] human um you know we've the the industry
[67:04] has has gone off on this like Fiat
[67:06] tangent over the last you know 10 or 15
[67:08] years and it feels more like propaganda
[67:11] than art you know what I mean I
[67:13] absolutely do it's interesting for me
[67:15] also as you said Bitcoin movies that
[67:18] that are really Bitcoin movies like uh I
[67:22] think about the Matrix Truman Show The
[67:24] Big Short in time there are a lot of uh
[67:28] really great movies if if you watch them
[67:31] and you are a bitcoiner you're like oh I
[67:33] can relate a lot to to bitcoin there I
[67:35] mean especially Matrix I mean Matrix is
[67:37] probably the the number one movie that
[67:40] is always uh brought up but I I do
[67:43] actually think also like I there's not
[67:45] that one actual Bitcoin movie where I'm
[67:49] like yeah that's that's a great great
[67:51] movie there are a lot of documentaries
[67:53] there a lot of those kind of things
[67:55] they're great but they're not a
[67:57] movie they they as you said they are
[68:00] factual they're not emotional like you
[68:02] really want to feel you want to watch a
[68:04] movie you want to feel that emotional
[68:07] connection to to the characters uh to
[68:10] the story and it really uh it should be
[68:14] a movie that a non bitcoiner is watching
[68:18] and also rooting for Bitcoin in that
[68:21] process it's probably a really hard
[68:23] thing to do and maybe we need one
[68:26] gigantic event in Bitcoin that hasn't
[68:30] happened yet where uh you then can wrap
[68:34] a story around that event and get some
[68:36] Bitcoin before that I I don't maybe know
[68:39] maybe that just didn't happen till now
[68:42] um I don't know I don't know if it's a
[68:45] positive or negative uh Story Probably
[68:48] negative like yeah would would would be
[68:51] interesting what what that story uh
[68:52] could be uh what what that could
[68:54] actually what that event could trigger
[68:57] such a big movie where Al like a big
[69:00] creators and storytellers would then
[69:02] also get behind and make that movie will
[69:04] be interesting to see but I definitely
[69:06] also wait for one like I am eager to to
[69:09] see an real Bitcoin movie that has um
[69:13] that class of like a matrix Movie that
[69:15] that that movie is amazing it's
[69:17] interesting when I watch The Matrix
[69:19] movie I cannot really watch it I get so
[69:21] motivated to work on something like in
[69:23] the middle of the movie it's it's it's
[69:25] it's really hard for me to watch that
[69:26] movie without getting motivated yeah I I
[69:29] yeah I totally agree I I'll I'll I'll
[69:32] I'll append my answer to yes the Matrix
[69:34] I mean I really that movie just holds up
[69:37] man it's so well done um it's so good um
[69:44] you know I think that you
[69:47] know there's a lot of
[69:50] um I shouldn't I I don't say a lot I I I
[69:53] come across like kind of an unspoken
[69:55] assumption a lot of times in the Bitcoin
[69:57] space that like 15 years is a long time
[70:00] or 16 years is a long time like it is
[70:02] not like we are we are in the you know
[70:04] this is like a toddler um we are so
[70:07] early in the lifespan of this um and in
[70:11] the
[70:12] cultural like kind of the cultural
[70:14] Echoes of the
[70:15] technology uh you know like this is a
[70:19] really weird analogy but like when cell
[70:21] phones started to become super
[70:23] ubiquitous there was a whole period of
[70:26] time where filmmakers really struggled
[70:28] with how to technically integrate a cell
[70:31] phone into a story like how do we okay
[70:34] they would text here and then we'd all
[70:35] be like well how do we shoot the phone
[70:37] and like or do we just do it digitally
[70:39] on screen and like if you go back to
[70:41] this transition to this period you'll
[70:42] see all these all these crazy ways that
[70:44] people tried to integrate that
[70:46] technology I mean this literally took
[70:48] years you know this is just a phone so
[70:51] um I I think that you know I haven't
[70:53] thought about it this deep until this
[70:55] conversation but I I happen to think
[70:57] that now I'll put I'll put my bet out in
[70:59] this way I think that as the world is
[71:04] descending into
[71:06] chaos through that chaos will be
[71:10] some some Timeless classic movies will
[71:15] come out of this um because you have
[71:18] turmoil and you have tension and you
[71:20] have all of these things that reveal
[71:22] character reveal the trajectory of
[71:24] humanity through stri and
[71:26] conflict I think that the I think that
[71:29] the what who will be the big artists of
[71:32] the next 15 or 20 or 30 years are just
[71:35] being born and I don't mean that
[71:37] literally I mean that just like
[71:38] artistically and technologically um so I
[71:41] think that some of the movies that get
[71:43] made about this time uh that are able to
[71:46] integrate Bitcoin just as a technology
[71:49] as house a main character used it to
[71:51] escape uh a war zone or oppression or
[71:55] human trafficking or whatever like
[71:57] whatever the use case is somebody's
[71:59] going to um really make a movie that
[72:02] everyone agrees is kind of the gold
[72:05] standard for representing that period of
[72:08] existence um and I think that that I
[72:10] think that those will be the ones that
[72:12] start to you know become the good the
[72:14] best Bitcoin movies thematically um I I
[72:18] so I think that we're at the very
[72:19] beginning of this and I think that the
[72:21] next 15 years are going to be um
[72:23] absolutely massive and unec eded for
[72:25] that type of work to be uh created I
[72:29] 100%
[72:31] agree it's it's a great endpoint of the
[72:34] podcast but I really love to I would
[72:36] love to see amazing Bitcoin podcast with
[72:40] amazing Bitcoin movie in the next like
[72:41] five years I I would love just like this
[72:44] this two and a half hour long Thriller
[72:47] that actually friends that are not in
[72:50] Bitcoin are actually excited to see and
[72:52] there's like some really big stars in
[72:54] there and like
[72:55] some some like r a big movie that would
[72:58] be really uh something amazing but we
[73:01] probably need a lot of price action in
[73:03] Bitcoin and some term as you said in the
[73:07] financial system but I could I could see
[73:09] it yeah um what yeah what I think I
[73:12] think it you know I think it'll happen
[73:14] uh selfishly I hope to be instrumental
[73:16] in that I hope Indie Hub is instrumental
[73:17] in that um there are definitely some uh
[73:22] huge bitcoiners in the entertainment
[73:24] industry
[73:26] um most of them are quiet about it they
[73:28] don't really want to be known about it
[73:30] or associated with it yet there will be
[73:32] a time where they can monetize their
[73:36] films and their projects where they're
[73:37] not under the thumb of a publicly traded
[73:39] company or network um and they'll be
[73:42] able to take that risk and earn that
[73:43] outsized reward I hope that Indie Hub
[73:45] can play a huge role in that um but all
[73:49] of that's to say that the energy is
[73:52] there the talent is there for sure um I
[73:55] think it's really just a matter of how
[73:57] do we get them uh to be able to make
[74:01] money on a movie like that uh that's got
[74:03] a budget of you know tens of millions at
[74:06] least um and and without having to deal
[74:10] with Studio Executives that uh you know
[74:14] have no interest in telling a Bitcoin
[74:16] story I I think that we're I think that
[74:18] we're on the verge of that I I would I
[74:20] would imagine it starts to happen here
[74:22] in Fairly shorter hopefully less than
[74:24] five years would love to see it really
[74:26] cool um perfect then uh what one
[74:29] question that I always ask my guest is
[74:31] what can we learn from you besides
[74:33] Bitcoin and I add for you uh besides
[74:37] film making oh man oh
[74:40] man um I I don't know I hope I hope that
[74:46] um I hope that some of the stuff I said
[74:49] was was able to offer some you know a an
[74:52] interesting or fresh perspective on some
[74:54] of this I know that I know that the
[74:56] Bitcoin podcast we tend to just cycle
[74:58] through the same commentary over and
[75:01] over again but I hope that I hope that
[75:03] that I was able to offer a little
[75:04] something here just sort of organically
[75:06] um
[75:09] inorganically uh man I I would I don't
[75:13] know I would just point to my own story
[75:14] I guess
[75:16] um you know I I started out my life
[75:20] probably a lot more cynical than I am
[75:23] now I wasn't like full-blown hardcore
[75:26] I've never been a hardcore cynic or
[75:27] anything like that um but I guess it
[75:31] would be that you know there is a
[75:33] tremendous amount of reasons to
[75:36] be um hopeful and positive and creative
[75:40] and
[75:41] constructive um it's a scary time things
[75:45] are very disorderly and becoming more
[75:47] disorderly by the day um but I I think
[75:52] that that's a necessary component to
[75:54] this whole
[75:55] um to this whole process I I had this
[75:59] realization um a little while
[76:02] ago about
[76:04] darkness and it was the realization was
[76:07] like if if darkness is rolling through
[76:12] town um it's probably not there for you
[76:16] like you can just get the [ __ ] out of
[76:18] the way like you can just continue to go
[76:20] build and be loving and kind and
[76:22] creative like you don't you don't need
[76:24] to
[76:25] um try to fight something that may not
[76:30] actually be looking for you um you know
[76:33] that darkness and destruction um I'll
[76:37] put it this way like there is nothing
[76:39] that is more powerful than the frequency
[76:41] of creation itself full
[76:44] stop even Darkness knows who writes its
[76:47] check like there's one Authority and
[76:50] that is creation there's nothing more
[76:52] powerful than that and destruction
[76:55] serves
[76:57] creation um it always has it always will
[77:00] um so if if it's not there for you thank
[77:04] it have gratitude for it because it's
[77:06] there to make the world a better place
[77:08] in the long run the transition is not
[77:11] going to be comfortable for a lot of
[77:13] people but that doesn't mean that you
[77:15] have to be directly in the middle of
[77:17] whatever that fight is maybe you do um
[77:20] but I think that generally speaking you
[77:23] know in aggregate we don't um and
[77:26] there's never a reason to stop being um
[77:30] constructive and loving and creative and
[77:32] kind and compassionate and and strong
[77:35] you know it requires a tremendous amount
[77:36] of Courage um to to withstand something
[77:40] like that and continue to keep your eye
[77:42] on the light um you know the the the the
[77:47] thought of meekness I think Jordan
[77:50] Peterson sort of made this famous um
[77:52] Meek not meaning you know like man like
[77:55] I'm super weak you know like it meaning
[77:57] that you know how to people who know how
[77:59] to use their weapons but decide to
[78:01] sheath them something like that um or
[78:05] the concept of like you can't be
[78:07] peaceful if you're not capable of great
[78:09] destruction uh they're two sides of the
[78:12] same coin
[78:14] um so I don't know I hope there's just a
[78:17] message of uh a little bit of Hope there
[78:20] that was at least my own personal
[78:21] realization you know that that Darkness
[78:24] works for
[78:25] Darkness knows who it works for it's not
[78:27] it's not the end of things it is it
[78:30] pales in comparison to the frequency of
[78:32] creation itself the frequency from which
[78:34] All Things become how could you possibly
[78:36] be more powerful than that um and the
[78:39] trajectory is is overall positive yeah
[78:41] especially that that with Jordan
[78:43] Peterson is uh is is such an eye
[78:46] openening thing as as he puts it uh I
[78:48] think he puts it as like um if you are
[78:51] not uh strong and dangerous
[78:55] uh but still uh loving caring and and
[78:58] just like not dangerous to the society
[79:01] you're not really disciplined like if if
[79:05] you if you could not um if you're not
[79:08] having a really powerful weapon as as
[79:11] like your body or whatever uh uh like
[79:14] how do I put it he puts it way better
[79:16] than me of course uh but it's like
[79:19] having a a weapon and being able to
[79:21] shoot someone and not doing it because
[79:23] of discipline that's disciplined but not
[79:26] having that weapon and not shooting
[79:27] someone is not disciplined because you
[79:29] don't even have the Capac capacity of of
[79:32] shooting someone I guess that's that's
[79:33] that's a point that you wanted to make
[79:35] and I love that uh the the comparison of
[79:39] of what Peterson is saying uh a lot I
[79:43] think it's it makes a lot of sense and I
[79:47] don't know how he how he he phrases it
[79:49] but it's also like become dangerous but
[79:51] be disciplined with it so something like
[79:53] that he message and I think it's it's
[79:56] very um it's a nice it's a really great
[79:59] message to make I love it a lot really
[80:01] cool yeah like I mean just kind of I
[80:04] don't know trying to synthesize what I
[80:05] said down even further is like all you
[80:07] have to do is choose the team like just
[80:09] choose the team of creation don't choose
[80:12] the team of Destruction and you're on
[80:14] the winning team like you're on the
[80:15] winning team like it's
[80:18] undefeated like it you know obviously
[80:21] there are periods of human history that
[80:22] are horrific and I'm not trying to
[80:23] downplay that at all
[80:25] um but in aggregate in the long run uh
[80:28] you kind of have one choice to make and
[80:29] I think that's the choice and if you can
[80:31] make that choice just have faith and
[80:33] trust that you're on the right team and
[80:34] you're going to win like we are going to
[80:36] win there's no question in my mind about
[80:38] that absolutely very cool uh with that
[80:41] let's come to the end routine of the
[80:42] podcast where the previous guest is
[80:44] asking a question for the next guest
[80:46] without knowing who the next guest
[80:47] actually is uh your previous guest uh
[80:50] asked a question when do you foresee
[80:53] hyperbitcoinization
[80:55] happening that's a cool uh I've never
[80:57] heard anybody do that that's a pretty
[80:59] cool little structure there um when do I
[81:02] see okay I guess we'd have to Define
[81:03] hyperbitcoinization in that in that
[81:05] context so how would we what's your
[81:08] definition of that that's that's a deep
[81:12] question but but I would just like to
[81:14] make it easy I would say that Bitcoin is
[81:19] as a unit of account as a medium
[81:21] exchange and as a store of value uh used
[81:24] more than 50% all over the world in all
[81:27] of those free categories so like it's
[81:30] it's uh it's the most dominant store of
[81:32] value most dominant unit of accountant
[81:34] most dominant media of exchange uh all
[81:37] across the world but they are still uh
[81:40] out of forms of currencies uh because
[81:44] that that's kind of for me have a
[81:46] Bitcoin isation if if it if it comes
[81:49] even to the point where there's only
[81:51] Bitcoin like Bitcoin is not dominant in
[81:53] all those categories but it's the only
[81:55] thing we we only measure everything in
[81:58] our world in in Bitcoin and we measure
[82:01] everything uh and we only transact in in
[82:04] Bitcoin I think that's pretty
[82:06] far H and it's it's it's better to
[82:09] measure like that like when do we come
[82:11] to a when when does Bitcoin become
[82:13] dominant and that that's I think
[82:15] probably the beginning of
[82:16] hyperbitcoinization
[82:17] man um you know you know what comes in
[82:21] mind here I'm going to like stretch this
[82:23] out and then try to answer it you know I
[82:25] I haven't I've never thought of it this
[82:26] way but maybe maybe there's an argument
[82:28] to be made um a definition of
[82:31] hyperbitcoinization is when Bitcoin has
[82:34] overtaken sovereign
[82:36] debt as a as a global savings account
[82:41] such that there's no outsized Authority
[82:44] by any particular Sovereign to control
[82:46] the price of money you know I I I
[82:49] certainly
[82:50] see Fiat currencies being around there's
[82:53] a lot of reasons for to exist um whether
[82:56] you agree with it or not um so I don't
[83:00] know let's maybe that number is um maybe
[83:03] that number is 200 or 300
[83:06] trillion um something like that I I
[83:10] don't I don't see that happening for I I
[83:13] would say 35 45 maybe 50 years um I I
[83:19] think
[83:20] that I I look at it also um in terms of
[83:23] generation
[83:25] you know so another way to frame it is
[83:26] like how many how many new groups of
[83:28] human beings need to be
[83:30] born um with Bitcoin as an
[83:35] assumed um part of life kind of the way
[83:38] the dollar is we're born into the money
[83:40] we have you know and so in that case 50
[83:43] years that's two generations like that
[83:44] that that compresses that time frame a
[83:46] lot like that generationally speaking
[83:48] that doesn't seem like a lot um to me so
[83:51] I I would say let's call it 50 years
[83:55] [Music]
[83:56] seems Seems realistic yeah um I will be
[83:59] in Bitcoin Amsterdam actually when this
[84:01] comes out I already was in Bitcoin
[84:03] Amsterdam uh and there we will speak
[84:06] about the vision for 2050 so in 26 years
[84:09] and it's already very hard to to Define
[84:11] like what's happening 26 years because
[84:13] when you think about it it's hard to
[84:16] think about next year and we usually
[84:18] overestimate what we can do in one year
[84:19] and we underestimate what we can do in
[84:21] 10 years but it's completely uh
[84:24] mindblowing what can happen in 26 years
[84:27] like we can go uh down like a really
[84:30] hyper biton World already in in that
[84:33] time frame because a lot can happen in
[84:35] that time frame but yeah it's it's
[84:36] really interesting and and and uh nice
[84:40] and fun to to talk about that uh in the
[84:43] end of the day it's it's it's hard to to
[84:45] Really pinpoint something uh but I think
[84:48] if we all kind of speculate and and we
[84:50] take the directional thing of that uh we
[84:53] we might be
[84:55] at least directionally uh correct in in
[84:58] a sense yeah really cool yeah thank you
[85:01] so much uh sack for for being on the
[85:03] show thank you so much for taking the
