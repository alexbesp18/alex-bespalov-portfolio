[00:00] what you have to do is in order to
[00:01] defeat Bitcoin is you have to make it
[00:03] more and more centralized a lot of
[00:05] people really don't have any Financial
[00:07] experience or education whatsoever there
[00:10] is competition to bitcoin all day long
[00:12] every single day it has to run 24/7 it
[00:15] can't make a mistake if there are other
[00:18] coins on its heels Bitcoin cannot relax
[00:20] it brings back a a reliable measurement
[00:22] tape for Value creation most of our
[00:25] cities in Europe and America if we look
[00:26] at them that the beautiful architecture
[00:28] all of what we see is from that period
[00:30] the second half of the 19th century do
[00:33] you see it as a big problem that uh
[00:35] mining is specialized business that it's
[00:37] maybe to
[00:39] centralized we are both uh from Austria
[00:42] am I right that's right yeah my my
[00:45] history is a little bit checkered but um
[00:47] I did grow up in in Austria I I was born
[00:49] in East Germany in the in the 78 but my
[00:53] parents fled East Germany and my my
[00:55] grandfather is Austrian so I was uh
[00:58] raised from uh second
[01:00] uh grade until finishing High School in
[01:03] Austria Vienna okay and then uh you
[01:07] moved when to America like you're in
[01:09] Florida well I spent some years yeah I
[01:11] spent some years in Asia um after our
[01:14] high school graduating in Vienna and
[01:16] then um after a couple of years I came
[01:19] back to Germany and studied their
[01:20] computer science um in gutting and and
[01:24] rostock focused on AI which is funny in
[01:27] hindsight especially uh my subject was
[01:29] computer computational Linguistics so
[01:31] the idea that language will be very
[01:33] important for uh achieving um Ai and so
[01:38] you know like I'm looking at this whole
[01:40] um large language model system and I'm
[01:42] like this is funny this is kind of
[01:44] coming back full circle but uh I left
[01:47] for the United States in 2007 I had a
[01:50] job in Hamburg as a junior software
[01:52] engineer actually not Junior at that
[01:54] point anymore but software engineer and
[01:56] then left for the United
[01:58] States and why did you leave
[02:00] still like um um I'll I'll tell you this
[02:03] actually uh is a little bit related to
[02:05] what we're talking about so my time in
[02:07] my time in Asia was very formative
[02:10] obviously people were this is the late
[02:12] 90s people were very optimistic uh about
[02:15] the future were forward-looking uh they
[02:17] still had a very traditional family uh
[02:20] model in most Asian countries you know
[02:22] so you you came from Europe and you just
[02:25] fell into these large families healthy
[02:29] Society
[02:30] structures uh but also very Pro Tech Pro
[02:33] advancements of the of the human
[02:35] condition and then I came back to study
[02:37] in Germany and it was like it was like a
[02:39] 180 degree difference you know everybody
[02:41] was negative everybody was full of
[02:43] self-hate towards themselves towards
[02:46] Society towards the future very critical
[02:49] about technology and I felt like an
[02:51] alien you know I mean obviously you know
[02:54] jumping between Austria and and Germany
[02:57] back and forth as a child I I always
[02:59] felt uh kind of part of both and then um
[03:03] being in Germany and looking at
[03:04] everything and working I didn't feel at
[03:06] home at all um but uh you know having
[03:09] had this exposure I really uh thought my
[03:11] children which at that point I had two
[03:13] young Sons I I wanted them to grow up in
[03:15] an English-speaking country and in a in
[03:18] an environment that was uh that was
[03:20] positive when it comes to technology and
[03:22] advancements and uh let people talk and
[03:26] think and create um any way they wanted
[03:29] and so I had some um relatives in the US
[03:32] and uh traveled there a couple of times
[03:35] and then uh met some friends and they
[03:38] were about to start a startup and they
[03:40] invited me over so I said like yeah
[03:42] that's a great opportunity and that's
[03:44] what I did and you came to an
[03:46] interesting time like 200 what 2009 2007
[03:50] actually so this was when the subprime
[03:53] um morgage crisis uh hit the ceiling so
[03:56] we were driving around trying to find
[03:58] houses and we like it was like a tiny
[04:00] little wooden Shack and they were
[04:01] selling it for $600,000 and I'm like
[04:04] what the heck is going on this makes no
[04:05] sense and then you would go to the bank
[04:07] and they was like okay yeah you can have
[04:09] a credit line of $100,000 you know go
[04:12] ahead and it just didn't seem to make
[04:14] any sense whatsoever on hindsight this
[04:16] was obviously the the second bubble
[04:19] after the internet um.com bubble um that
[04:22] had impacted uh me actually you know
[04:25] after college and uh yeah it was
[04:27] interesting so I I did some stock market
[04:29] trading at the time too I saw the whole
[04:32] meltdown um and uh the company that I
[04:35] was hired for they went um they went
[04:37] into receivership they went bankrupt uh
[04:39] so I uh was a float there for a while
[04:41] and then um started another company with
[04:44] a with a different friend and that's
[04:46] when I discovered Bitcoin in
[04:49] 201112 oh 1112 is is really early I
[04:53] think um like we have so many people
[04:55] that now like heard about Bitcoin they
[04:57] have so many misconceptions about
[04:59] Bitcoin in their head and they still
[05:00] don't don't get it and they need to get
[05:02] over so many hurdles um like how did you
[05:06] get it so
[05:07] early well so I'll tell you like for me
[05:09] it wasn't even early enough I was pretty
[05:11] frustrated at the time about it because
[05:14] the the main source of my of my news
[05:16] consumption at the time was Hecker news
[05:18] which is that y combinator News website
[05:21] originally started in Silicon Valley and
[05:23] it's like a software originally software
[05:26] engineering Insider news platform uh for
[05:29] focused on startups I went to some of
[05:31] their conferences and um I found them
[05:34] the brightest most intelligent people
[05:36] with very thought through comments would
[05:38] comment regularly on that on that site
[05:41] and any new technology that came along
[05:44] um had a very profound discussion
[05:46] typically on there but there was a lot
[05:48] and so you couldn't stay up to date all
[05:50] the time and I missed the first
[05:51] mentioning of Bitcoin on there
[05:52] unfortunately so in 2011 was like the
[05:55] second or third time someone mentioned
[05:56] Bitcoin and the discussion was very
[05:58] interesting so I pulled up the white
[05:59] paper and given my computer science
[06:02] background I kind of read through it and
[06:04] I thought I thought the Byzantine
[06:06] generals uh solution to the problem of
[06:08] decentralized networking I thought that
[06:10] was that was amazing that was great and
[06:12] it came it came not from Academia it
[06:15] came from from someone outside the um
[06:18] Academia and he he basically not just
[06:20] left it with a white paper he actually
[06:22] implemented a a basic version of this
[06:25] concept and so I showed it to my
[06:27] co-founder at the time I said like look
[06:29] at this that's pretty cool uh we should
[06:32] we should try it out we should just see
[06:34] what we can do with this and he's like
[06:36] he turned around and said like Leonard
[06:37] let me tell you something this is
[06:39] America we call this a Ponzi
[06:42] scheme and I said like I know what a
[06:44] Ponzi scheme is this is not quite a
[06:46] Ponzi scheme uh this is something else
[06:48] you know especially looking at the
[06:49] technology at the time so we we started
[06:52] downloading the the you know the
[06:54] reference
[06:55] implementation um I don't even know what
[06:57] it was like Point uh uh 18 16 whatever
[07:02] early one of the very early versions and
[07:05] um Bitcoin was trading around a dollar I
[07:07] think or maybe less than a dollar and we
[07:10] um we we mined it you know CPU mining
[07:13] was still possible a little bit not much
[07:15] um it has it had kind of just moved to
[07:17] GPU mining um so we uh we let it run on
[07:22] all our laptops uh and computers
[07:24] wherever there was a graphic card we
[07:25] started buying some graphic cards and we
[07:26] actually we actually got into mining to
[07:28] the point where were uh we were
[07:31] considering this to be a serious
[07:32] Endeavor of ours uh at the time we were
[07:35] running a software company kind of
[07:37] focused more on email marketing and that
[07:39] kind of thing um and we look for some
[07:41] investors but every time I I ran these
[07:43] calculations on mining
[07:46] profitability uh you know how this goes
[07:48] it's um you put the money in you buy
[07:50] some uh mining equipment and then uh you
[07:53] have to wait a year or something before
[07:55] you see a return of your investment uh
[07:59] at the current bitcoin rate so either
[08:01] you you believe strongly that Bitcoin is
[08:04] going to go up uh and or that power
[08:08] prices are going to fall um but
[08:10] regardless once you make that profit
[08:13] your equipment is outdated and you have
[08:15] to pour all that money back into mining
[08:18] if you kind of want to keep staying uh
[08:21] competitive and so we were looking at it
[08:23] we decided against it um but uh we had
[08:26] already a little Fleet of computers
[08:28] mining uh
[08:30] yeah in general I think the the problem
[08:33] that I saw uh with my background
[08:35] particular on the One S on the one hand
[08:37] my my family is very libertarian my my
[08:40] dad was a huge anti-communist as you can
[08:42] imagine having been born in East Germany
[08:45] in fleeing there uh my my problem was
[08:48] that I thought the government if it
[08:49] really understood Bitcoin would have to
[08:52] shut it down as as fast as possible
[08:56] because if it didn't shut it down it
[08:59] would would take over and to me that was
[09:02] apparent in 2011 12 so I was I was
[09:06] thinking that there smart people in
[09:08] government and they will shut it
[09:11] down it's interesting for me because
[09:13] there was a point like in the early days
[09:15] where it could have been shut down and I
[09:18] think we have now reached a point where
[09:20] it's near impossible outside of a crazy
[09:24] black SW event where it cannot be shut
[09:26] down um and you are involved so early in
[09:30] this project when do you think did we
[09:33] reach that point of no return where
[09:35] Bitcoin was just out of the bottle and
[09:37] not even China with their uh strategies
[09:41] to get rid of it like or the US cannot
[09:44] shut it down like first of all do you
[09:47] think we are above above this point
[09:49] where we cannot shut it down and then
[09:52] like when did we reach it yeah yeah yes
[09:54] and yes and no so in a in a way I think
[09:56] for me personally 2016 felt like um 16
[10:00] 17 felt like a very a pivotal point in
[10:03] kind of the spread of Bitcoin it it
[10:05] really reached a very different layer of
[10:08] um of of user base um and in that in
[10:12] that time frame uh a lot more widespread
[10:15] than the kind of nerdia Parts uh that I
[10:18] was involved in in the in the early
[10:20] couple of years and so if it's that
[10:23] widespread it's getting really really
[10:24] hard for the government to do anything
[10:26] because in part even the uh congressmen
[10:30] and politicians they all had Bitcoin
[10:31] they all have Bitcoin um I remember we
[10:34] went to one of the very first Bitcoin
[10:37] Outreach days here in Tallahassee which
[10:39] is the capital of Florida it was I
[10:41] believe it was 2 H don't quote me on
[10:43] 2018 or so and we we uh met with a lot
[10:47] of congressmen and and senators and uh
[10:50] politicians every time we sat in the
[10:52] waiting room to meet another
[10:53] representative the the ladies there
[10:55] would ask us what is the best wallet you
[10:57] know what exchange uh can they sell or
[11:00] buy different coins and where do we
[11:02] think Bitcoin is going to go and that
[11:03] was 2018 so I realized at the point this
[11:06] is the mycelium of Bitcoin has has made
[11:09] it so far there's probably no way for uh
[11:13] for even politics to stop it or out rule
[11:16] it however having said that there is an
[11:19] ability to slow capture Bitcoin and
[11:23] because most I think most of what the
[11:25] the system does to competition is more
[11:29] like a a zunzu uh um attack a deceptive
[11:34] um one when you you can snuff out
[11:36] certain things very early but you have
[11:38] to be very early and you have to be very
[11:39] firm to do that uh very often these
[11:42] systems are sluggish and they don't they
[11:44] don't react that fast maybe in an
[11:45] authoritative State like Iran or China
[11:48] or something which actually happened if
[11:49] you think of China right that's what
[11:51] they realized at some point that's what
[11:52] they did but usually I think what
[11:54] happens in the west is a hijacking a um
[11:58] a a a very slow creep into the system
[12:01] kyc comes to mind as kind of one of the
[12:03] biggest ways to to kind of curtail
[12:07] bitcoin's inherent nature of free
[12:10] exchange and so at this point the the
[12:13] the blockchain has been analyzed is
[12:15] being analyzed the on and off ramp is
[12:18] totally
[12:19] kyc and so it and all the the banking
[12:23] laws and financial laws um fully apply
[12:26] to bitcoin and any Bitcoin company that
[12:28] operates rates uh in the US and in
[12:31] Europe so there's really no exemption at
[12:35] this point in any form or fashion and
[12:39] the benefits that Bitcoin brings to the
[12:41] table besides the store of value um are
[12:45] much harder to take advantage of in this
[12:50] environment and um I I believe if things
[12:54] would have gone a little bit differently
[12:56] um especially if the financial sector
[12:58] and the political sector weren't so
[13:00] closely connected with each other
[13:02] Bitcoin would have probably already won
[13:04] if this was like a completely free
[13:06] competition it probably would have you
[13:09] taken over the Banking and Financial
[13:10] system
[13:12] entirely so you were you're saying that
[13:15] uh KC is kind of a slow attack on uh on
[13:19] bitcoin one the many yeah one of one of
[13:21] the many ways to to slow the the
[13:22] progress of it down you try basically
[13:25] what you have to do is in order to
[13:27] defeat Bitcoin is you have to make it
[13:29] get more and more centralized your
[13:31] system is centralized and now you're
[13:32] competing with a which is not which is
[13:35] not necessarily bad right a centralized
[13:36] system uh centralized database can have
[13:39] many does have many advantages first and
[13:41] foremost it's fast and it's cheap um but
[13:44] it has the problem of trust and control
[13:47] and the the main advantage of Bitcoin
[13:49] the decentralized trustless nature of it
[13:52] is one that is really only beneficial in
[13:55] certain aspects of life and that's when
[13:58] you have to deal with a lot lot of
[13:59] humans a lot of power and you want to
[14:02] make sure that that doesn't get abused
[14:04] and there certain cases in life where
[14:06] where you do want a trustless system
[14:09] government government comes to comes to
[14:11] mind that is a public good that can that
[14:13] comes with a lot of power um that you do
[14:16] want to be as DEC decentralized and as
[14:19] trustless as possible because you don't
[14:21] want anyone to be able to take it over
[14:22] and control it for their own purpose
[14:24] money is another one uh maybe insurance
[14:28] would be another one maybe maybe uh
[14:30] notarization digital notaries is another
[14:32] one so there are certain aspects where
[14:35] the public uh wants to make sure that
[14:37] not one individual group owns and
[14:39] controls it and uh yeah so I think the
[14:42] more Bitcoin gets pushed
[14:44] into
[14:47] centralization uh the less its benefits
[14:50] are
[14:51] apparent um so that's I think has been
[14:53] the attack Vector ever since the
[14:55] beginning of you know when they realized
[14:57] it can't be it can't be turned off is uh
[15:00] the Bitcoin ETF part of it like is
[15:02] Bitcoin ETF uh like they they also
[15:05] trying to infiltrate it trying to like
[15:07] centralize Bitcoin Holdings yeah I mean
[15:11] obviously and I think for everyone
[15:12] everyone probably in your audience has
[15:14] read the Bitcoin standard and those who
[15:16] haven't read the Bitcoin standard it's a
[15:18] you know highly recommended book to read
[15:20] history of money in general the history
[15:22] of the gold standard in particular and
[15:24] then how Bitcoin kind of plays into that
[15:26] as a new version of the gold standard if
[15:29] you will and if you if you look at the
[15:32] at the Playbook the gold gold standard
[15:34] was was amazing there there may be an
[15:37] argument for our entire uh modern way of
[15:41] life you know if you if you think about
[15:43] humans existed as an Agricultural
[15:45] Society for uh well at least since the
[15:48] beginning the dawn of history since the
[15:49] forming of of cities around agricultural
[15:52] um societies so for what 10,000 years
[15:56] let's say we've we've basically existed
[15:59] in an agricultural uh life where most of
[16:03] the progress resolved around revolved
[16:05] around you know maybe some City
[16:07] architecture that's it and then we have
[16:09] the Renaissance and Newton coming along
[16:13] and the forming of the gold standard you
[16:15] know you can put that somewhere around
[16:17] 1600 um uh something when was it 1660
[16:21] 1670 and all of a sudden the next 300
[16:23] years you see an
[16:25] explosion in uh technology and
[16:28] innovation
[16:29] and capital formation something that's
[16:31] never existed before that actually makes
[16:34] us sit here talk on a computer um and I
[16:37] think gold uh was probably a big part of
[16:40] it if not the only one and uh the reason
[16:43] is because you need that metric system
[16:46] of value communication to communicate
[16:49] between humans what is expensive what is
[16:52] hard to what is hard to um automate
[16:55] currently what is what is takes up more
[16:58] resources and what is very easy and what
[16:59] is very simple to accomplish and um if
[17:03] nobody can mess with the with the ruler
[17:06] then we can measure our social
[17:08] interactions with each other and prices
[17:11] come to be and the prices tell us
[17:13] basically there's a huge inefficiency in
[17:15] this area and we can all attack it we
[17:17] will attack it because it will bring us
[17:19] profits if we do and if we succeed the
[17:21] prices should start to fall and if the
[17:24] prices fall they benefit everyone in
[17:27] society and so we're all using the same
[17:29] ruler the same measurement tape if I
[17:32] improve the production of of uh clothing
[17:35] in one area you're going to benefit
[17:37] because now you can dress yourself and
[17:40] you can save all the time and effort
[17:42] that you had before on creating your own
[17:44] garment and apply that extra time that
[17:47] you gained and attack another
[17:50] inefficient part of life and so Society
[17:53] I think saw this spiral upward where
[17:56] everyone become became wealthy and
[17:58] wealthier um until about
[18:00] 1913 I think there's certain inertia in
[18:03] these systems obviously it continued a
[18:05] while but I think for the last 50 years
[18:08] um especially in the regulated areas
[18:09] we've seen a certain stagnation and
[18:12] especially in the last 10 20 years the
[18:15] paper Printing has gone completely nuts
[18:18] and as everyone most people are familiar
[18:20] with at this point paper Printing was
[18:22] originally receipt on gold so we've
[18:24] taken that ruler and we've officially
[18:26] artificially added another ruler and
[18:28] that that is actually just a rubber band
[18:30] that can be stretched infinitely uh and
[18:33] so we've lost a lot the ability to to
[18:36] take advantage of of trustworthy
[18:38] monetary systems yeah and I think a lot
[18:41] of people also um fear that the same
[18:44] thing could happen to bitcoin uh with
[18:47] layer two three five Solutions or even
[18:49] like with Bitcoin ETF and stuff like
[18:50] that yeah sorry for kind of renting but
[18:53] uh that's actually where I wanted to go
[18:54] so I had a conversation the other day
[18:56] with a Trust Company actually trust fund
[18:58] um there a lot of them have been
[19:00] involved since uh the FDX blow up
[19:03] destroyed a little bit the relationship
[19:05] between Banks and Bitcoin in 2020 there
[19:08] was still actually was like a a big
[19:11] marriage between Bitcoin and banking
[19:12] it's beautiful to see I was one
[19:14] conference you know you had big Banks
[19:17] promoting Bitcoin and Bitcoin companies
[19:19] promoting Banks it was actually really
[19:20] fascinating actually mind-blowing and
[19:22] then FTX
[19:24] happened uh a couple of months later
[19:26] after this conference and and took down
[19:29] that relationship uh froze it over um
[19:32] brought a nice excuse for The Regulators
[19:34] to separate the the kind of emerging uh
[19:38] integration and what happened now is you
[19:41] have conversations like the one I just
[19:42] recently had where it goes like well you
[19:46] know you can park all your Bitcoin with
[19:48] us and you know it's very happy it's
[19:51] very difficult to move um if you once
[19:55] you park it with us and all the ETFs do
[19:57] and all the big Bank to it's all sitting
[19:59] here with us uh then you can just use
[20:04] our API system to shovel money back and
[20:07] forth between each
[20:08] other uh on our on our rails on our
[20:11] internal
[20:12] system and you don't ever have to touch
[20:15] Bitcoin so you know we basically make
[20:18] sure that um it's efficient and that
[20:21] that causes obviously a concern because
[20:23] if you look at the history that's
[20:24] exactly what happened with gold you know
[20:25] everybody started parking their gold in
[20:27] central places receipts were issued the
[20:30] paper receipts were supposed to be
[20:31] exchangeable for bit for Bitcoin for
[20:33] gold one to one and then it kind of took
[20:35] off from there so there's a certain
[20:37] danger that with secondary tertiary
[20:39] layers you disconnect from the actual
[20:43] money the one that everyone says is the
[20:45] one that they trust um and you walk away
[20:49] from the non-custodial aspect to a
[20:52] custodial
[20:53] aspect yeah and then I think uh there's
[20:56] always a drawback with technology like
[20:58] you can never never have like a perfect
[21:00] uh uh piece of technology everything has
[21:03] like the small uh
[21:05] disadvantages uh that can that basically
[21:08] cannot be the The Perfect Solutions
[21:10] because of course it would be perfect if
[21:12] Bitcoin with the decentralization and
[21:14] the security also uh is scalable on the
[21:18] base layer and is also really fast and
[21:20] cheap and stuff like that but you need
[21:21] of course uh the the the drawbacks to
[21:23] have the the
[21:24] advantages yeah and so that's obviously
[21:27] I think it's still an ongoing
[21:28] conversation and it will probably follow
[21:30] us for a while uh I I I'm always
[21:34] fascinated by by people and projects
[21:36] that try to tackle this fundamental
[21:38] problem you could say it's a fundamental
[21:40] problem of of a decentralized network
[21:42] having to communicate across the globe
[21:45] and settle within
[21:47] minutes um and make it scalable on each
[21:50] transaction while allowing people to
[21:52] hold their private Keys directly and be
[21:56] super efficient and super inexpensive so
[21:58] I I I do think we shouldn't give up on
[22:00] this we should keep looking into it it's
[22:02] just too important uh not to have or not
[22:06] to be able to to to solve um there have
[22:09] been you know hundreds not thousands of
[22:11] papers in the cryptograph uh
[22:13] cryptography kind of space it's really
[22:15] interesting actually to follow and look
[22:17] at some of the breakthroughs but I
[22:20] that's you know I I do think
[22:22] experimentation shouldn't stop and
[22:25] Bitcoin itself the protocol itself um
[22:28] should you know should look at this and
[22:30] see if uh if it can evolve further and
[22:33] obviously I've been there when um
[22:35] Bitcoin blockchain forked um the bit the
[22:38] the block wars happened and then I was
[22:40] pretty close to all of that um so yeah
[22:43] I'm I'm definitely on the side of uh of
[22:47] um experimentation and keeping an open
[22:50] mind yeah definitely how was that 2017
[22:54] uh blocks War it's uh like I
[22:56] unfortunately came to bit in 2020 so I
[22:59] only hear from people telling me how it
[23:02] was uh how was that area yeah so it was
[23:05] actually interesting because I was so
[23:07] focused on building our business by
[23:09] federal at that time um so I was
[23:11] actually you know you mentioned this
[23:13] it's you know it's really beautiful know
[23:15] I had this moment yesterday in the
[23:16] office and just took a step back and
[23:18] said like it's amazing that we're
[23:19] allowed to kind of work on this amazing
[23:21] technology every single day and I don't
[23:23] really take that for granted at all it's
[23:25] really a beautiful thing to be able to
[23:26] do so appreciate you know our customers
[23:29] and and co-workers and everything that's
[23:31] been been built um and having said that
[23:34] 2016 is when I started by federal and uh
[23:39] 2017 was our first year in business and
[23:43] it was really extremely brutal because
[23:45] you are trying to build something in a
[23:47] space where you have to deal with
[23:49] regulations and The Regulators that
[23:51] don't know anything about the technology
[23:54] you have to deal with banks that don't
[23:55] want anything to do with you and see you
[23:57] as competition
[23:59] and then you have the you know early
[24:02] Bitcoin crypto technology that you have
[24:03] to kind of implement and make sure that
[24:05] it works for customers so we were right
[24:07] there so the focus was more on kind of
[24:08] building a business than anything else
[24:10] but um I saw it kind of from the
[24:12] sidelines and um honestly at the time my
[24:17] even the conversation about Bitcoin is
[24:19] stored value Bitcoin as a transactional
[24:22] uh medium of exchange that wasn't that
[24:24] wasn't all that settled most of our
[24:26] Bitcoin up until I say 2017 18 we
[24:30] actually spent because we believe that
[24:33] we had to spend them to show the public
[24:36] and the world that Bitcoin is usable in
[24:39] daily life so so a lot of very active
[24:41] bitcoiners from that time they would not
[24:43] sit on you know on their thousands of
[24:46] Bitcoin they would um mine them and they
[24:49] would spend them uh they would maybe buy
[24:52] and sell trade a little bit for but very
[24:54] often they would talk to businesses
[24:56] local business owners and say like let
[24:57] me set up with bit pay let me show you
[25:00] how you can uh how you can actually
[25:01] implement it and then we would spend in
[25:03] order to show that it's actually a
[25:05] feasible technology uh so the so when
[25:08] the when the cost of transactions
[25:10] started to rise this was a big issue was
[25:13] a big big um problem and lightning
[25:15] didn't even exist and was just you know
[25:17] an academic paper so um I found myself
[25:21] in the camp of of Big Blocks I wanted
[25:24] the transactions to be cheap I had very
[25:26] often argued
[25:28] that Bitcoin um should be used for micro
[25:32] micro payments and um obviously the
[25:35] discussion ended up being well then not
[25:38] everyone can run a node when the nodes
[25:41] get really really big um and it's a
[25:44] decentralization issue uh but at at the
[25:47] same time the mining had already become
[25:49] I'd already experienced that not
[25:51] everyone could mine mining had already
[25:53] become a specialized business um and
[25:57] there was always is a worry that you
[26:01] could lose control over the network
[26:03] either by having you know a few data
[26:05] center running all the blocks or a few
[26:08] data centers running all the mining and
[26:10] then having control over it and uh I
[26:13] just watch that this discussion and the
[26:16] Hope was the second layer would solve
[26:19] these problems um and lightning has to a
[26:21] certain degree um but it has also
[26:24] inherent issues and problems too so it's
[26:27] not I I don't see this as a solved I
[26:29] don't see this as a solved problem yeah
[26:32] it's definitely not and I see also a lot
[26:33] of problems like there like at least
[26:36] four five layers we discussed already on
[26:38] the podcast you are my 998th uh guest so
[26:41] you can imagine that we had a lot of
[26:43] different discussions a lot of different
[26:45] directions already with 98 different
[26:47] guests uh in the topic of Bitcoin uh and
[26:50] the interesting part is that we all kind
[26:53] of agree that we need that base layer
[26:56] and we all kind of agree that we need
[26:58] need a scaling solution and most in the
[27:01] Bitcoin Community uh um and I think
[27:04] almost everybody in on my podcast agree
[27:06] that we have to scale through layers
[27:09] like we did in the internet with the
[27:10] dcpip protocol and stuff like that um
[27:14] but there's even like the the mining
[27:16] argument I hear that also more and more
[27:19] uh that mining is getting too
[27:21] centralized I mean in 2021 there was
[27:23] like before 2021 there was a lot of
[27:25] mining in China now they kind of broke
[27:28] that down and now there's at least not
[27:31] 70% of of mining power in China this was
[27:33] always a big argument before that um do
[27:36] you see it as a as a big problem that
[27:38] mining is is um a specialized business
[27:41] that it's maybe true
[27:44] centralized no honestly no I don't I I
[27:48] used to see it as a problem I don't
[27:50] anymore I think it's more important to
[27:52] have this huge hash rates protecting the
[27:54] network making it really hard to roll
[27:56] back uh I see it as a bigger problem if
[27:58] all of your hashing power is in one
[28:00] country if uh if it's you know if it's
[28:02] 70% is in China or 70% is in the United
[28:05] States that's probably a bigger thing a
[28:06] bigger issue and um I but
[28:10] I'm given my my my kind of
[28:13] open-mindedness and all of these things
[28:15] I don't even mind contemplating really
[28:16] radical things uh there are there are
[28:18] coins out there some of the old proof of
[28:20] work coins that not proof of stake I
[28:23] think is a is a wrong direction because
[28:25] it is so easy to relatively easy to take
[28:27] over that's my issue with with proof of
[28:30] um proof of stake the government can
[28:32] print as many funds as they want and try
[28:34] to Bubble Up enough of the network in
[28:37] terms of coins to then influence the
[28:39] validator nodes with mining is a little
[28:41] bit harder or let's say a lot harder you
[28:43] need the infrastructure Technology power
[28:46] and so on so forth um but I wouldn't
[28:50] even mind changing the hashing algorithm
[28:52] every couple years to break down the
[28:55] Asic uh machinery and bring mining back
[28:58] to GPU or CPU level um obviously right
[29:02] now in Bitcoin is almost impossible
[29:03] because it would destroy a multi-billion
[29:05] dollar industry and and just completely
[29:07] upset them uh ethereum did it obviously
[29:10] because they went for staking which I
[29:11] think was wrong I don't think you should
[29:13] go for staking I think you should
[29:15] decentralize the mining as much as
[29:16] possible and if every laptop can mine in
[29:20] the background good luck for a
[29:22] government to take over there that's you
[29:24] know that's going to be very very tricky
[29:26] if you have uh a couple of big mining
[29:28] pools you know it's a different star you
[29:30] could infiltrate them potentially and
[29:32] you have some power um at that point but
[29:35] um but in general it is I think it's
[29:38] it's it's much harder so but you know we
[29:42] could change the hashing algorithm um if
[29:44] we wanted to other proof of work coins
[29:46] have done it and of course it's a hard
[29:48] Fork it's a It's You Know download which
[29:51] it's difficult for a network like
[29:53] Bitcoin with tens of thousands of nodes
[29:56] I told you a lot about 21 bit Bitcoin
[29:58] the best place for me to buy Bitcoin
[30:01] directly on a Bitcoin only exchange but
[30:03] now let's talk about how to secure your
[30:06] Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin you don't
[30:08] want to leave them on Exchange you want
[30:10] to take self custody you want to take
[30:13] responsibility of your own Bitcoin
[30:16] that's why I recommend getting a bitbox
[30:19] bitbox is an amazing wallet where you
[30:21] can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[30:24] simple way very secure you can even
[30:27] create a pass phrase with that
[30:29] passphrase you can basically create a
[30:31] hidden wallet on the device itself make
[30:35] sure to buy your bitbox in the link down
[30:38] in the description and with code Robin
[30:40] you even get a 5% discount at is there's
[30:44] always this discussion I think I think
[30:46] five or six guests ago uh someone said
[30:48] like we should not touch Bitcoin too
[30:50] much now uh and develop more on the on
[30:54] the layers above it uh which is also an
[30:57] interesting
[30:58] but I think we should always try to
[31:00] experiment but with experimentation try
[31:03] to not break it like yeah so so okay so
[31:06] that you're bringing up a good point so
[31:07] even having said experimentation right
[31:09] honestly I like actually that argument
[31:11] very much I personally I would not have
[31:14] touched bitcoin's core
[31:16] code um let's say after 2015
[31:22] 145 bug fix is a different story but I
[31:25] would not have changed the protocol in
[31:27] fact I probably would have the dynamic
[31:29] blocks I think that's a cool idea
[31:30] because trans you the more transactions
[31:32] you have the more you can immediately
[31:33] compete with visa and all the other ones
[31:35] whatever but I do see the argument for
[31:37] for Layer Two as well but in general I
[31:40] would not have tinkered with it and I
[31:42] wouldn't want to change it too much
[31:43] because it very much you mentioned tcpip
[31:45] the tcpip protocol is from the
[31:48] 70s we're not we're not not touching it
[31:51] um and so we the the experimentation I
[31:55] think would be in in I guess new forms
[31:58] new coins around it side chains or
[32:00] whatever else if something turns out to
[32:02] be like Breakthrough technology huge
[32:06] Advantage Bitcoin would probably take
[32:09] that over and take that on into
[32:12] incorporate it into its own core as as
[32:15] one massive tcpip if you will upgrade um
[32:19] but that might happen only every five or
[32:21] 10 years and in the meantime you have a
[32:23] very stable protocol that everyone can
[32:25] build on everyone can you know kind of
[32:27] build businesses on and then you know if
[32:31] there's really some groundbreaking new
[32:32] technology you you you you shift to it
[32:36] um and heck I wish we had I wish we had
[32:40] voting on The blockchain because then we
[32:42] could make actually decisions as well uh
[32:45] you know maybe people who had a certain
[32:47] amount of Bitcoin could vote on the on
[32:49] the future of of the protocol itself um
[32:53] but obviously there you have to be
[32:54] careful too um yeah it's interesting for
[32:58] me uh the because when we look at the
[33:01] history of money uh money evolved
[33:04] obviously a lot we had like different
[33:06] forms of Lang we have like stones we
[33:07] have gold and we now feared and
[33:10] obviously when you have uh read the
[33:13] Bitcoin standard you know about the
[33:14] history and I think most of the people
[33:16] listening had had read the Bitcoin
[33:18] standard um then when you think of now
[33:22] and when we like think of the next 50
[33:24] years where Bitcoin could potentially be
[33:26] the next evolution of money and it's
[33:28] becoming the dominant dominant monetary
[33:31] base layer um which we then have a
[33:34] dominant monetary base layer that we
[33:37] could uh try to uh Tinker with try to um
[33:42] change when we find something completely
[33:45] new that's better because what like why
[33:49] did gold fail as money because we we
[33:52] were globalized more it was too heavy
[33:54] like there were drawbacks to it but when
[33:56] we discover robics to to Bitcoin in like
[33:59] 00 years we could theoretically I don't
[34:02] know if it's practical uh then change
[34:05] Bitcoin for that uh to to make still
[34:09] sense in in the in the in the future how
[34:12] do you see like is is could could
[34:14] potentially Bitcoin be the the end goal
[34:16] of
[34:17] money uh no I don't I'm a I'm a I'm such
[34:21] a Libertarian pro market person I don't
[34:23] I don't think there's an end there
[34:24] shouldn't be an end to to markets and
[34:26] optimization um it might get
[34:29] incorporated into something else it
[34:31] might even if you think of Bitcoin
[34:33] there's certain features of Bitcoin that
[34:35] are taken from gold as an inspiration if
[34:38] you will so I don't think ideas
[34:40] necessarily um die good ideas don't die
[34:44] they have a they have a place even if
[34:45] it's just in the pantheon of of the past
[34:48] of good ideas and they kind of guide us
[34:50] in the future decision-making in the
[34:52] future so um I don't think it's the I
[34:55] think it's the end of uh of mon AR
[34:58] Evolution um but it is definitely a
[35:00] complete paradigm shift and if anything
[35:05] Bitcoin actually lives in a very envir
[35:06] in very interesting environment because
[35:08] it it is being um there is competition
[35:12] to bitcoin all day long every single day
[35:16] it has to run
[35:17] 247 it can't make a mistake if you will
[35:21] there are other coins on its on its
[35:23] heels if you will most of them will die
[35:26] most of them will not even maintain the
[35:27] value as Bitcoin does but Bitcoin cannot
[35:31] relax if you will if Bitcoin makes a fun
[35:33] if the Bitcoin core developers or
[35:35] whatever make a fundamental mistake the
[35:38] community can just switch from one to
[35:40] the other overnight and so I find this
[35:43] hilarious because the banking system is
[35:45] so freaked out now that the settlement
[35:47] times become faster and faster they're
[35:48] like oh my God you know people can take
[35:50] their money out of One bank and move it
[35:52] to another bank overnight is going to
[35:53] bankrupt us uh yes that's the point if
[35:56] you're making a mistake stake if your
[35:58] bank does not work properly yes you
[36:00] should be bankrupt um but so should be
[36:03] the government if you will or so should
[36:05] be uh the municipality or should be any
[36:08] other uh
[36:11] inefficient Place corrupt environment
[36:13] that does not take good care of
[36:16] someone's uh funds or future so so no I
[36:19] I think this is actually really really a
[36:21] beautiful environment that Bitcoin finds
[36:23] itself in and it has to compete um
[36:25] constantly and at the same time what
[36:28] what would really stop us from absorbing
[36:32] uh certain new technologies that come
[36:34] along one one good example is for
[36:36] instance Quantum Computing resistance
[36:38] there's probably some upgrades that will
[36:41] that will happen that will come into
[36:42] Bitcoin uh and maybe some other coins
[36:44] experimenting with it right now which I
[36:46] think actually they are um so yeah H
[36:50] definitely and this this is this this
[36:52] idea like uh when people ask me oh what
[36:54] do you do when Bitcoin fails I'm like
[36:56] okay then I was wrong about Bitcoin but
[36:59] I'm still right about the fundamental
[37:02] values that I uh talk about with the
[37:05] libertarian F absolutely I think I think
[37:08] right and I think I agree with you I
[37:09] think we have to separate those two
[37:10] things like Bitcoin is is is a
[37:12] technology right so Bitcoin should
[37:14] necessarily become um I mean we can make
[37:16] it our religion that's fine it's almost
[37:17] like for me it's almost religion because
[37:18] I I work sleep and breathe it but in in
[37:21] generally the the the impact of Bitcoin
[37:25] what it actually can do and does to
[37:28] society that is the amazing that's the
[37:31] fascinating part the ability to notarize
[37:34] for instance anything any activity of
[37:36] human that's important for public
[37:39] consumption that outsources almost all
[37:42] of our government I mean we funny enough
[37:44] we really haven't been there and haven't
[37:46] even experimented with these parts yet
[37:49] um and this is you know one of my
[37:50] experiments people can go into my
[37:52] history and they can check it out
[37:52] they'll find it relatively quickly I did
[37:54] publish um two research papers in the
[37:56] last two years on voting because it's
[37:59] very close to my heart and um we're
[38:01] experimenting also on another on another
[38:04] coin my case marscoin with it but the
[38:06] technology itself can easily be
[38:08] implement it on on bitcoin and there
[38:10] might be even a Bitcoin version for it
[38:12] but when you do anything on bitcoin you
[38:14] get immediately kind of uh close
[38:16] scrutiny which especially when it comes
[38:18] to voting is better if you can
[38:20] experiment elsewhere but the the the the
[38:22] basic fact is that the blockchain
[38:23] technology itself and the hashing uh and
[38:28] supporting the individual blocks and
[38:30] making it near impossible to roll back
[38:32] makes it a perfect system for um
[38:35] decentralized voting and there's a
[38:38] there's an algorithm that we were
[38:39] looking at closer which is called the
[38:41] coin Shuffle algorithm um it's similar
[38:44] to a coin join but not exactly the same
[38:46] and a coin Shuffle algorithm would be
[38:48] perfect or would be a great way to test
[38:50] it where individual citizens the the
[38:53] voters if you will are you know like
[38:56] every country has a voter registry right
[38:58] now where you can kind of look up your
[38:59] name and you know that that person
[39:01] exists it's actually a citizen um and
[39:04] then you you can take that if you have
[39:06] that on the blockchain and you can let
[39:08] them vote and the the votes themselves
[39:11] get anchored into the blockchain so
[39:13] there's a a very clear trace of someone
[39:17] from the pool of Voters cast a vote you
[39:20] don't know who it was you can see that
[39:23] they voted and the the outcome of that
[39:26] election
[39:27] is uh um auditable or is countable
[39:31] within fractions of a second so you
[39:33] could see a future where all of us our
[39:36] our voting our our titles our house
[39:39] titles our car titles everything is is
[39:42] on blockchain and you walk into a house
[39:45] you like the house you buy it title
[39:46] shifts over the blockchain to you um you
[39:50] know you you sell something titles move
[39:52] around uh Insurance gets adjusted um
[39:56] maybe even borrowing Works maybe better
[39:58] than it it did with Celsius or some
[40:00] other uh companies but you have uh you
[40:04] have all of these interactive features
[40:07] reflected on a blockchain and I I think
[40:10] that's a future that we're that we're
[40:11] looking at so it's going to be
[40:12] fundamentally not just changing Finance
[40:14] but also the public interactions the
[40:17] Civic interactions in general and that's
[40:20] interesting like this is the the the
[40:22] area where I'm not as uh deep into that
[40:28] uh uh because I'm just not researching
[40:30] too much I'm I'm like now really focused
[40:32] on bitcoin and the monetary aspect and
[40:34] and this one uh but that could be really
[40:36] interesting Parts the the asking the
[40:39] question that I always ask myself is the
[40:41] the Oracle problem if you if you have
[40:43] something on the blockchain you have to
[40:45] get it somewhere up so like there has to
[40:46] be some kind of process to it uh which
[40:50] is not in in Bitcoin but there could be
[40:52] somewhere else uh but it's an
[40:54] interesting field and and uh I'm as you
[40:57] said also really big proponent of just a
[41:00] free market because if if it is if it is
[41:03] something it will catch on for the long
[41:05] run and it will ACR to value in the
[41:07] short run every Everything can ACR to
[41:10] short-term value and then get get some
[41:12] trends of pumps up and uh but it will
[41:15] come down eventually if it has no no
[41:17] real value to to people because even
[41:19] with art for example I don't get why
[41:21] people uh pay millions or even uh more
[41:25] than that for like some pictures on the
[41:28] wall I personally don't get it but
[41:31] obviously when someone is willing to pay
[41:33] that money it has some value for
[41:36] somebody I don't want to tell him that
[41:38] he cannot do that uh just because I
[41:41] don't get it h and this is where uh a
[41:45] lot of the debates in Bitcoin and in in
[41:48] crypto also uh come in there because if
[41:51] it has value uh then obviously uh it has
[41:54] some some kind of utility I always try
[41:58] to be completely Bitcoin only and I also
[42:01] try to not promote anything else because
[42:03] there are a lot of scams and a lot of
[42:05] fishy things going on in the crypto
[42:07] economy and I just don't want to get
[42:09] involved in this uh and I always like I
[42:12] think I published today the episode
[42:14] where I said uh I try to educate uh
[42:17] people on bitcoin uh but if they still
[42:20] try to get into some scam uh they
[42:23] deserve to learn like they just deserve
[42:26] to learn their lesson in there yeah
[42:28] that's one of the that's one of the
[42:29] things that I noticed too a lot a lot of
[42:31] people really don't have any Financial
[42:34] experience or education whatsoever and I
[42:38] also wonder where that came where that
[42:39] came from maybe you know the the
[42:41] regulation and the government's
[42:43] interference in markets in in my mind
[42:46] are problematic to say the least and
[42:49] it's always done to protect or for
[42:51] safety but what it really ends up um
[42:54] besides being not very successful for
[42:57] the most part um and usually putting a
[42:59] burden on the people that are actually
[43:01] good already um I I think the other
[43:04] problem that it does create is a
[43:05] mentality shift it ends up creating
[43:07] human beings that are extremely
[43:10] vulnerable that have a very distorted
[43:12] view of the world
[43:15] and yeah period and in investment is a
[43:18] good example when the stock markets it's
[43:20] it's beautiful the history of the of the
[43:23] Golden Age here the Gilded Age uh the
[43:26] you you know the most of our cities in
[43:28] Europe and America if we look at them
[43:30] the the beautiful architecture all of
[43:32] what we see is from that period the
[43:35] second half of the 19th century if you
[43:37] really really walk around and take a
[43:39] look at that a lot of it comes from from
[43:41] that period of time especially the
[43:42] individual not I mean the Kings they
[43:44] were all able to build something
[43:45] beautiful in the past with a lot of
[43:46] slave labor but you had this period
[43:48] where the gold um standard really
[43:51] allowed individuals to build wealth
[43:53] within their families and they spend it
[43:55] on beautiful
[43:57] architecture art whatever and I I think
[43:59] they when you when you look at how they
[44:01] interacted with each other in the stock
[44:03] market there was nobody protecting
[44:05] anybody from anything you know you had
[44:07] Banks defaulting left and right taking
[44:10] down a certain amount of investors for a
[44:12] certain period of time but the general
[44:14] public became wealthier and um so more
[44:18] self-reliant I think over time and this
[44:22] creating this bubble around people and
[44:25] not teaching them how to
[44:27] even uh vet Investments because you're
[44:31] saying you have a you have some agency
[44:33] protecting them and going after scams
[44:36] sure you can do that and that's fine but
[44:38] why not let the free market create
[44:40] auditing firms free market auditing
[44:43] firms free market certification
[44:45] processes where instead of having a
[44:48] regulator who gets captured Maybe by
[44:50] someone coming out of a scammy industry
[44:52] you have companies vest
[44:55] or vet other other companies and I I
[44:59] think that would be a healthier way of
[45:01] dealing with um scams and it would
[45:04] probably also produce people that are a
[45:05] little bit more informed and don't
[45:08] necessarily fall for every silly scam
[45:10] that comes along yeah definitely and
[45:12] it's also like when I think of uh the
[45:15] current world where we try to regulate
[45:17] everything I mean it's a little bit
[45:19] different maybe in America uh but it's
[45:22] like the saying America innovates China
[45:24] copies and the EU is regulating it uh
[45:27] which is also a little bit true uh a
[45:29] little bit it's very true actually uh in
[45:32] my view uh and Bitcoin then uh brings
[45:35] the free market to a certain extent back
[45:37] because it it forces people to do it
[45:40] it's like the it's like Bitcoin the
[45:42] dream of an austri economics it's like
[45:44] the yeah it is it is isn't it um but it
[45:48] also shows you the reverse is true too
[45:50] it shows you by how much it's regulated
[45:54] it's like a temperature measurement of
[45:56] your own society and of your own
[45:58] government the the heavier it's
[46:00] regulated the more it's suppressed the
[46:03] more you know you live in an unfree
[46:05] Society um that's my opinion I think the
[46:07] United States in the last while since
[46:09] I've been here has gone has tried to
[46:12] catch up with Europe as fast as they can
[46:15] which I don't think is a good idea at
[46:17] all hence now the innovation has is is
[46:21] with some exceptions seems to be leaving
[46:23] to China and that's not a good thing
[46:26] either uh neither for Europe nor for
[46:28] America so um we'll see it's an
[46:30] interesting story and you and I are in
[46:32] the middle of it yeah absolutely what do
[46:35] you think currently of the European
[46:36] Union uh and the Bitcoin
[46:40] stands um well I don't know too much
[46:43] about the the the MAA um regulation that
[46:47] was put in place I know that in we've
[46:49] looked into European regulation quite a
[46:51] bit a couple of years ago we had some
[46:54] attorneys look through the different
[46:56] regulations in especially in the German
[46:58] speaking countries because I was curious
[46:59] to see you know what it would take to
[47:01] kind of replicate uh our business model
[47:03] over there and it's it's been always
[47:06] doable um and actually in fact even a
[47:10] few years ago I think it was easier than
[47:12] it than it was in the United States
[47:13] because when we started out in many ways
[47:16] there was no regulation whatsoever um
[47:19] and you just had to well typical for
[47:22] America you just had to seek the
[47:23] conversation and you had to just try and
[47:25] experiment in Europe very quickly you
[47:28] had rules they came out of nowhere they
[47:29] were there and that's fine the rules are
[47:33] okay but they usually come with a lot of
[47:35] money involved in it so it it keeps out
[47:37] the ordinary people from from starting
[47:40] something new which is unfortunate and
[47:42] that's I think my general view on the on
[47:44] on Europe and European regulation um by
[47:48] trying to order society which can have
[47:51] its benefits you're also putting in a
[47:53] threshold that kills off Innovation and
[47:56] you read a you really be darn sure that
[47:58] that's a good
[48:00] tradeoff um because in the end you may
[48:02] end up with a with a with an
[48:05] order um
[48:08] that suffocates
[48:10] people yeah definitely and it's it's
[48:13] like so interesting to see as you said
[48:15] before when we see the time we are right
[48:18] now alive and and can live through and
[48:20] and see what's happening um and then we
[48:23] can see uh States like the Europe States
[48:27] like America then we see small country
[48:29] experimenting with Bitcoin like El
[48:31] Salvador which they are having a lot of
[48:34] interesting things going on even Beyond
[48:36] Bitcoin for example that na puka is not
[48:39] giving out free passports for skilled
[48:41] people he's really trying to get capital
[48:43] and talents in the in in the country um
[48:46] it's like do you see El Salvador as a
[48:49] one of the role models when it comes to
[48:50] bitcoin adoption or is there any other
[48:52] country where you say like this should
[48:54] be the the the role model
[48:58] um let's put it this way El Salvador
[49:00] really was at the bottom of the list of
[49:02] all the countries you you couldn't
[49:04] really go lower than they were with the
[49:08] crime and the poverty and everything
[49:10] it's good for them you know good for na
[49:12] buil to come in and and try to change so
[49:15] so almost anything rational that he does
[49:18] at this point just keeps lifting the
[49:20] country up um I actually just before our
[49:23] call as one of our colleagues posted the
[49:25] video just a big uh grp Google building
[49:27] headquarter whatever was was built and
[49:30] launched in in El Salvador so they're
[49:33] it's it's beautiful it's good for them
[49:34] I'm really happy for them honestly um I
[49:38] wish uh America and Europe would be on a
[49:41] completely different trajectory that we
[49:43] had a a free economy completely free
[49:47] economy with hardly any regulation that
[49:49] our governments would only invest in
[49:52] military and police and make sure that
[49:55] you know they're not attacking from the
[49:57] outside and that there's civil order on
[49:59] the inside but to get the hell out of
[50:01] the way of the individuals and let them
[50:03] actually build and create and fail and
[50:07] go to prison if they so choose um but uh
[50:11] other than that I think we have we have
[50:14] you know in many ways given up on the
[50:16] dreams that were very strong in the 50s
[50:18] 60s maybe even 80s you know I youve see
[50:21] maybe a lot of space books behind me I
[50:23] was raised um in the 80s that you know
[50:26] by this time I'd be on the Moon Mars
[50:28] there'll be flying cities in the sky so
[50:31] in in many ways we've kind of shot
[50:33] ourselves in the foot several times over
[50:36] and uh I'm very happy for China
[50:40] discovering
[50:41] capitalism um and uh that was good for
[50:44] them but us taking our jobs and
[50:46] factories and Manufacturing and
[50:48] intellectual property and just shipping
[50:49] it over was a very big mistake you know
[50:53] no problem helping the Chinese get up
[50:55] and and develop like we should the rest
[50:57] of the world but at the same time I
[50:58] think we shouldn't lose focus on um the
[51:01] history and culture and civilization
[51:03] that was built in America and Europe and
[51:06] supercharge it not uh dismantle it and
[51:10] and I think part of the fear of the
[51:13] future is seen in regulation um and very
[51:18] often I wonder if it is it may be
[51:21] actually a second order effect of an
[51:23] aging society that by having less
[51:26] children and investing less into your
[51:28] own personal future you have an aging
[51:31] Society tries to protect the past and
[51:34] make sure you know the peace in the um
[51:38] retirement home is not Disturbed so the
[51:41] more regulations you have and the more
[51:43] warnings uh to make sure the kids shut
[51:46] up uh the safer the olders are the
[51:48] elderly are H but I don't think that's a
[51:51] way to to embrace the future or or build
[51:53] something incredibly uh wonderful to be
[51:56] proud of yeah it's also interesting when
[51:58] you see the birth rates and uh we we
[52:01] kind of get problems when when people
[52:04] not make enough babies then yeah then we
[52:07] kind of die right yeah you I know this
[52:10] is often thrown at capitalism you know
[52:11] this in Endless greed or whatever but my
[52:14] my argument usually is like look have
[52:16] you had have you have you have you read
[52:18] one astronomy book yeah the the universe
[52:21] is Big nobody ever said we need to be
[52:24] confined on one planet in fact we
[52:26] shouldn't it's like you know you're
[52:27] floating on this tiny little speck
[52:29] through space it's not going to last
[52:32] forever uh the the biosphere is not
[52:34] going to be unchanged forever that that
[52:38] would be a insane assumption so we have
[52:41] a chance is thinking individuals to
[52:44] actually spread out over the solar
[52:46] system take life to all the other
[52:48] planets we could terraform Venus and
[52:51] Mars and turn them into secondary Earths
[52:54] um who what system allow us to do that
[52:57] it is technology it's growth it is
[52:59] actually a capitalism that's even more
[53:02] anarchic and faster moving than anything
[53:05] we've seen so far so um I think the
[53:09] future of humanity is really bright but
[53:12] you have to believe in that future you
[53:13] have to invest in that future you know
[53:16] um and nobody knows exactly how it's
[53:18] going to look like but I I want to
[53:21] believe in a in a in a positive
[53:23] optimistic way for Humanity forward it's
[53:25] interesting what said before where you
[53:27] said like uh you imagine that we this
[53:30] time already colonizing other planets
[53:33] that we have flying cars flying cities
[53:34] and stuff like that is is is feat one of
[53:37] the or maybe even like the main reason
[53:39] why we don't have Innovation or like
[53:42] there's other reasons to it I you know I
[53:45] follow very closely the the website wtf1
[53:48] 1971 which is closely related to um
[53:52] safe's book in fact actually before
[53:53] safein was was done writing I had this
[53:56] convers ation with him um and Peter teal
[53:59] was pretty pretty strong outspoken on
[54:01] this very
[54:03] strange stalling of progress especially
[54:06] in the west uh since the 70s kind of you
[54:09] know like there's a there's a certain I
[54:11] should say inertia in all these systems
[54:12] but something really strange because we
[54:14] if you take someone from the 70s and
[54:16] drop them right into this place okay and
[54:18] what they're going to look at like they
[54:20] see the cars they more or less look the
[54:21] same maybe they're a little bit more
[54:23] water drop shaped um they're going to
[54:26] see the houses all look the same in fact
[54:28] actually the houses are made out of
[54:29] Cheaper materials in some cases uh the
[54:32] cars are made out of Cheaper materials
[54:33] in some cases and the infrastructure
[54:36] looks more or less exactly the same um
[54:38] however they won't see a uh they won't
[54:41] see maybe even some of the nuclear
[54:42] reactors been shut down at this point
[54:44] they won't see the um um well some of
[54:48] the bullet trains maybe turned off
[54:49] whatever but in general the archit the
[54:52] architecture infrastructure of the 70s
[54:54] and the 2020s in Europe and America is
[54:56] is very very similar except for
[55:00] computers uh cell phones uh maybe some
[55:03] biome medical breakthroughs that have
[55:06] happened since then so industries that
[55:10] have been left relatively unregulated
[55:13] have seen most of the breakthroughs and
[55:16] and modernization but the other
[55:18] industries that were heavily regulated
[55:21] seem to have been lacking and falling
[55:23] behind and then when it comes to paper
[55:25] money is really interesting paper money
[55:27] allowed the government to blow up in
[55:29] proportion it's insane so this the size
[55:31] of a government that we have in Europe
[55:33] and America these people are hired they
[55:36] have a job and they need to keep
[55:38] themselves busy so with with a very big
[55:41] government you just increase more
[55:42] bureaucracy you create even more breaks
[55:45] on the system itself um we've seen this
[55:48] in history it kind of keeps repeating
[55:50] itself and I I believe switching from a
[55:53] gold standard completely disconnecting
[55:55] in 197 one was one of those pivotal
[55:57] moments that is probably responsible to
[56:02] a big to a big degree um of of seeing
[56:05] some of our progress um being stifled
[56:09] held back um and cost of living if you
[56:12] think about it you know we're just
[56:13] talking about families if you want to
[56:15] have more children in the 50s you know
[56:17] one person went to work and you had a
[56:20] house and you had four five children
[56:22] whatever uh now you have three people
[56:25] four people working under the same roof
[56:28] and the kids can't leave because they
[56:30] can't afford it and uh yeah so I do
[56:33] think money has to do with it and I
[56:34] think Bitcoin plays a pivotal role in a
[56:37] bright human future by bringing that
[56:40] measurement tape back and allowing us to
[56:42] actually measure things
[56:44] precisely uh indirectly maybe even
[56:47] leading to a collapse of huge gigantic
[56:50] bureaucratic structures because they can
[56:52] be outsourced um not outsourced they can
[56:55] be outc competed or they can be um
[56:57] unlocked the capital that's locked up
[56:59] that can be unlocked by automating it um
[57:02] but also if the paper money fleas into
[57:04] something like gold standard and Bitcoin
[57:07] then these bureaucratic structures can't
[57:09] support themselves anymore because
[57:11] they're basically supported on
[57:12] theft absolutely and that's uh I we have
[57:16] end routine in the podcast where the
[57:18] previous guest is asking a question for
[57:19] the next guest and the endro team is
[57:22] really nicely fitting now in our in our
[57:24] conversation actually uh so I will
[57:26] switch down to the end routine and the
[57:28] question is from the previous guest what
[57:30] is your favorite thing that Bitcoin
[57:33] fixes I think it's exactly that the
[57:36] thing I just mentioned my favorite thing
[57:37] that it fixes is that it brings back a a
[57:40] reliable measurement tape for Value
[57:43] creation and it Reigns in the production
[57:45] of paper money and I think paper money
[57:47] was responsible for an overhead in
[57:49] government and Regulation and actually
[57:52] technical technological decline so that
[57:55] to me is the favorite and that's why I
[57:56] wake up every day and I'm super excited
[57:58] to you know work on bite Federal and and
[58:01] get more and more people um a chance to
[58:04] flee the weak currency and get into the
[58:08] the hard
[58:09] money yeah definitely it's uh it's an
[58:12] amazing journey I've been now I think
[58:15] five six weeks fulltime in Bitcoin so
[58:18] I'm like still a junior in the full-time
[58:21] Bitcoin working but it's a it's an
[58:22] amazing experience and it's uh such a
[58:25] such a amazing thing I stand up work
[58:28] basically still till I cannot work
[58:30] anymore sleep and do the same thing the
[58:33] next day because it's just so amazing uh
[58:36] and it's an great experience uh Lenard
[58:39] it has been a pleasure talking with you
[58:40] it has been a pleasure uh exchanging
[58:43] Thoughts with you uh is there when
[58:45] people want to get in touch with you
[58:46] when people want to uh see what what
[58:49] you're up to and ask your questions
[58:51] where can people reach you in the in the
[58:52] best way yeah probably the best way is
[58:55] um is uh on Twitter X or on over our
[59:00] website so the so the company itself is
[59:02] called bite Federal like computer bite
[59:04] byte
[59:06] federal.com uh you can reach me through
