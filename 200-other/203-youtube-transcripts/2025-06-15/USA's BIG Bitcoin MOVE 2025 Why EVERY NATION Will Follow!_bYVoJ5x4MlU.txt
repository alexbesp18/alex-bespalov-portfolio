[00:00] I believe that the goal is to acquire 1
[00:02] million Bitcoin that's going to be
[00:04] massive for Bitcoin that's basically
[00:06] four micro strategies every other
[00:08] country in the world is going to have to
[00:09] consider oh do we need to buy Bitcoin
[00:12] now Larry think and black rock really
[00:14] have moved the Overton window where the
[00:16] public sees Bitcoin as a legitimate
[00:19] mainstream asset are they really rate
[00:21] saving if what they're holding is losing
[00:24] purchasing power I just exchang my
[00:26] dollars for Bitcoin I just want the
[00:28] better money Bitcoin has definitely
[00:30] changed my life significantly how I view
[00:33] the world when bitcoin's volatile and
[00:35] you're you're first learning about
[00:36] Bitcoin no one's going to be there to
[00:37] like hold your hand and like bail you
[00:39] out and get you through it you have to
[00:40] really understand what you own Bitcoin
[00:42] produces a more Merit based society
[00:44] where the the great ideas will win out
[00:46] most people think they understand money
[00:48] and they have no clue about
[00:50] [Music]
[00:54] money what what are your thoughts on on
[00:57] on his election and what the impact on
[01:00] Bitcoin will be for that I think it's
[01:02] going to be great I saw like both
[01:03] scenarios playing out with Camala
[01:05] winning or Trump winning um both in the
[01:10] end being good for Bitcoin but I think
[01:12] in terms of like nation states it it's a
[01:15] race now to the finish right Trump has
[01:17] said he wants to put a strategic Reserve
[01:21] have one for the US Cynthia lumus has
[01:23] proposed the bill I believe that the
[01:26] goal is to acquire 1 million Bitcoin um
[01:29] I don't know how they're going to do it
[01:31] but and if it'll pass that bill but if
[01:33] it does pass you know that's going to be
[01:36] going to be massive for Bitcoin that's
[01:38] basically F four micro strategies
[01:41] combined right a million Bitcoin and of
[01:43] course now until inauguration date which
[01:47] is January 20th of
[01:50] 2025 every other country in the world is
[01:52] have G to have to consider oh do we need
[01:55] to buy Bitcoin now if the United every
[01:58] other country usually like major country
[02:01] follows what the United States does um
[02:03] with a lot of things
[02:06] so I I think like you might see nation
[02:10] states start moving in right now and a
[02:12] lot of them might be doing it quietly uh
[02:15] because they don't want to move the
[02:16] price but I would start I I tweeted this
[02:20] out yesterday start building your own
[02:22] personal strategic Bitcoin Reserve if
[02:25] you don't have one already which just
[02:27] means keep stacking stats and keep
[02:29] buying Bitcoin
[02:30] and uh yeah learn how to self custody
[02:33] and things like that yeah it's it's like
[02:36] for for me it's since four years now I
[02:40] mean three four years now where I'm like
[02:43] everything that is not needed directly
[02:45] is going into Bitcoin like that that's
[02:48] my that's my strategy I'm just like 100%
[02:50] in there uh I mean obviously if you have
[02:53] a family it's maybe a different story
[02:55] because I'm just uh I have a girlfriend
[02:57] but I'm just alone and young if you have
[02:59] a company there's like difference you
[03:01] you should have some some cash probably
[03:03] laying around for for shortterm things
[03:05] but my the Strategic Reserve is just
[03:07] like 100% in and and uh if if if America
[03:12] actually goes ahead and buys a million
[03:13] Bitcoin obviously I would be interesting
[03:16] how they do it because they probably
[03:17] cannot do it uh without people knowing
[03:20] like I think if if they do something
[03:22] like that obviously people will know
[03:24] that they will do it and at that point
[03:26] the price will just rip and maybe they
[03:29] never get to the million I don't know
[03:30] but they have the money printer so they
[03:32] have a lot of uh uh lot of buying power
[03:35] to do that but yeah still as you said
[03:37] for micro strategy that's that that's a
[03:40] lot I also heard today I don't know if
[03:42] you saw it but na PUK was was having a
[03:45] phone conversation with Trump apparently
[03:47] not talking about Bitcoin but I don't
[03:49] know how you can talk with nuk without
[03:51] talking about
[03:53] Bitcoin yeah I know Trump has said a few
[03:56] things about El Salvador on the campaign
[03:59] Trail they haven't always been
[04:00] necessarily the most positive um so
[04:03] we'll see what happens with that
[04:04] relationship um El Salvador definitely
[04:08] made the first big move um into Bitcoin
[04:12] but you know almost every country in the
[04:15] world pales in comparison to bitcoin
[04:18] this isn't anything against El Salvador
[04:20] but the US you know it makes all those
[04:24] all the smaller countries irrelevant
[04:27] when it comes to purchasing Bitcoin you
[04:29] know you have like the country of Bhutan
[04:32] I think is how you pronounce it they're
[04:34] mining Bitcoin you have all these like
[04:36] little countries um but this is an
[04:39] absolute game Cher and I don't really
[04:42] think the overall markets have priced
[04:46] this in yet 76,000 like that's nothing
[04:50] um considering where the price can go
[04:53] absolutely yeah that's that's true um
[04:55] it's also funny for me uh as I'm those
[04:58] four years now the Bitcoin that's like
[05:00] my history how I look at Bitcoin and the
[05:02] narrative changed quite a lot like this
[05:05] environment narrative has from my point
[05:08] of perspective quite changed like I I
[05:12] don't hear it that much anymore that
[05:13] Bitcoin is bad for environment uh a lot
[05:16] of mainstream media is is going a little
[05:19] bit into the Bitcoin conversation like
[05:21] especially like the last year I felt
[05:23] like Bitcoin conversation also in the
[05:25] mainstream media and also like when you
[05:27] just go into real life and like uh with
[05:30] in in talks with people the The
[05:32] Narrative feels like it changing a
[05:34] little bit how will that continue to
[05:37] change over like the next five years
[05:39] especially if now like presidents and
[05:43] and nation states are going into Bitcoin
[05:44] it feels like then there's no going back
[05:47] for
[05:48] narrative yeah as you said I don't hear
[05:50] anyone saying well what if the US
[05:52] government bans Bitcoin you know and we
[05:54] always had counter arguments about that
[05:56] anyways um and we're not hearing about
[05:59] the ESG concerns since and this this
[06:03] probably started when Larry thinkink at
[06:06] Black Rock really decided all right
[06:08] we're gonna make a push into Bitcoin and
[06:11] we're gonna you know and the the ETFs
[06:14] the US Bitcoin ETFs happening have
[06:17] really changed the whole have moved the
[06:20] Overton window uh so to speak um on
[06:23] where the public sees Bitcoin as a
[06:27] legitimate mainstream asset you know the
[06:30] only people still like laughing at
[06:33] Bitcoin are just uh the the really
[06:36] really ignorant or the Peter shifts of
[06:39] the world who are just kind of talking
[06:41] their own bags but uh you don't see any
[06:45] of those people shorting Bitcoin it's
[06:47] also interesting uh do do you think the
[06:49] Bitcoin ETF had had an impact also on
[06:52] Trump's decision to acknowledge it and
[06:54] to to embrace it because now there's
[06:57] like black rug and big operations behind
[07:00] that oh I mean I think it legitimized it
[07:04] in so many people's minds a lot of
[07:05] people around Trump now um that have his
[07:09] ear are very Pro Bitcoin uh I know
[07:12] people from the Bitcoin space really had
[07:13] a big push with this like David Bailey
[07:16] from Bitcoin magazine but you also have
[07:18] someone like uh Howard lutnick who is uh
[07:22] the CEO of caner Fitzgerald is on
[07:24] Trump's transition team and he said he
[07:26] said only a couple weeks ago that he has
[07:29] hundreds of millions of dollars of
[07:30] Bitcoin himself and that he plan
[07:33] personally and that he plans on it being
[07:36] billions of dollars and that he just
[07:37] keeps buying so and that's someone that
[07:40] is leading Trump's transition team uh I
[07:44] I'm pretty sure JD Vance his vice
[07:45] president has Bitcoin and holds Bitcoin
[07:48] yeah it seems like it seems too good to
[07:51] be true right now uh but yeah things
[07:54] seem really positive for Bitcoin uh
[07:57] maybe uh because I'm not from the US
[08:00] what's the Trump transition team what
[08:02] what transition okay so basically
[08:05] when you become president there is
[08:09] someone that helps you that's in charge
[08:11] of making sure uh you get the right
[08:14] people into place in your new
[08:17] Administration and helps with that whole
[08:19] whole flow so the person leading that is
[08:21] very Pro Bitcoin um and has Trump's ear
[08:25] so that's a good thing oh man that
[08:27] that's huge actually I never heard about
[08:29] that when when the the guy that's
[08:32] basically in charge or not not in charge
[08:34] but has a major influence of like where
[08:38] who is sitting where uh in the position
[08:42] um is kind of leading the way there and
[08:45] is a m massive Bitcoin that I never
[08:47] heard about that interesting uh yeah
[08:50] there he was on um Anthony Pompano's
[08:53] podcast a couple weeks ago it was a
[08:55] really good uh episode definitely if you
[08:57] haven't checked that one out uh not that
[09:00] I'm trying to pump other podcasts on
[09:01] your show but it's it's really
[09:03] interesting I was engaged and definitely
[09:05] I would I would check that out and it's
[09:07] not just him RFK is a bitcoiner right
[09:10] RFK Jr and he's supposed to come in not
[09:12] not to be on the you know economic side
[09:15] of things but just all these people who
[09:17] are have a vested interest in Bitcoin
[09:20] being in the new administrations
[09:23] extremely bullish for Bitcoin regardless
[09:26] of how much Trump even gets Bitcoin um
[09:29] which I know that's still up for debate
[09:31] some people like oh he's just pandering
[09:32] to bitcoiners um he has surrounded
[09:36] himself with people who are bitcoiners
[09:39] through and through yeah it's it's it's
[09:41] interesting for me sometimes I think he
[09:43] just acknowledges that he has to be for
[09:46] Bitcoin like he he has no clue what what
[09:48] Bitcoin actually is and he's like yeah
[09:51] okay I need their vote and and that's
[09:53] why I embrace it that's kind of my
[09:55] understanding of it yeah I again um
[10:00] but it might not even matter whether he
[10:02] what kind of understanding he has as
[10:03] long as the people around him understand
[10:05] and he follows through on it so only
[10:08] time will tell we have
[10:10] 74 days I think until the inauguration
[10:13] so we'll see what happens absolutely
[10:17] will be really fascinating uh to to see
[10:20] all that playing out but uh it's it's
[10:23] it's a great to topic I think the I
[10:25] think the next few years like the next
[10:27] like especially next like one two years
[10:30] will be extremely exciting uh maybe like
[10:33] the next three five years uh but we'll
[10:35] we'll be see um when we now have nation
[10:39] state let's let's have this F A little
[10:41] bit uh further down the road when we
[10:43] have now nation states adopting Bitcoin
[10:46] and we have kind of this form of of of
[10:49] of counries actually buying it is is
[10:51] that just like the starting point of
[10:54] like feat completely crashing and and we
[10:57] have a a Bitcoin standard is is that the
[10:59] path towards that or how do you see that
[11:02] yeah I'm not really sure how that will
[11:05] take place um I think there will be
[11:08] signs of when you see that it's it's
[11:11] going to be all other Fiat currencies
[11:13] before the dollar that start to slip so
[11:16] it's not like overnight Bitcoin is just
[11:18] going to be the world Reserve currency
[11:21] um you're gonna a lot of things are
[11:23] going to have to happen in the world um
[11:25] one for that to happen and also I guess
[11:27] there's there's a difference between it
[11:28] being the World Reserve currency and
[11:31] replacing all Fiat currencies right
[11:33] because it could still be the reserve
[11:34] currency but fiat currency is still
[11:38] exists
[11:40] so
[11:41] um it's a good guess as anyone how
[11:44] that's going to play out I just know
[11:47] that you need to make sure you're
[11:49] holding the better money um so when it
[11:51] does play out you're not left uh holding
[11:54] the the Fiat bag so to
[11:57] speak yeah you don't want to end up with
[12:00] with with the with the wrong it's kind
[12:03] of amazing for me how there are still a
[12:05] lot of people and they uh they're even
[12:09] they're not acknowledging that they're
[12:10] making a decision if they have only US
[12:14] dollars or only Euros I I hear people
[12:17] literally saying like oh I don't like I
[12:19] I just save my money I don't want to
[12:22] invest it and and then I'm like but
[12:24] where do you save it like and then
[12:25] they're like yeah euros and then like
[12:27] yeah that's that's an decision like
[12:29] that's an investment decision you're
[12:30] putting uh you you're betting on the
[12:33] Euro being worth something in the future
[12:36] that's H the same betting decision as
[12:39] you would go with the dollar or you go
[12:42] with the Bitcoin or you go with like a
[12:45] real estate property like you're making
[12:47] a financial decision yeah and it's are
[12:50] they really rate saving if what they're
[12:53] holding is losing purchasing power right
[12:55] they're not even saving they think
[12:57] they're saving but they're not saving
[12:59] and it's this especially in more
[13:00] developed worlds inflation's a little
[13:02] more Insidious because it's not as
[13:04] obvious right away because it's a lot
[13:07] slower it's one thing if you're in like
[13:08] Argentina or Venezuela or Lebanon you
[13:11] see how your paper currencies trash
[13:13] right but the other Fiat currencies the
[13:15] more established you know ones like the
[13:18] dollar or uh the Euro the British pound
[13:21] whatever you know you don't see it as
[13:23] quickly so people
[13:25] don't don't understand that it's not a
[13:28] savings account when they're
[13:30] holding um holding fiat's currencies
[13:33] it's actually it's a losing value
[13:36] account right that's that's that's what
[13:38] we should start branding at right this
[13:39] is you're losing your time you're losing
[13:41] your value uh account and you know I
[13:43] don't even talk about Bitcoin from an
[13:45] investment perspective um if I'm being
[13:48] like straight with someone you know
[13:49] sometimes you need to know your audience
[13:51] but for me like people like do you
[13:53] invest in Bitcoin I'm like oh I just
[13:55] exchanged my dollars for Bitcoin I just
[13:59] want the better money I'm not thinking
[14:01] about oh this is a better investment I'm
[14:03] not making an investment decision I'm
[14:06] just
[14:07] making a better decision I I I I don't
[14:10] know if that's if that's uh just
[14:12] semantics or not but it would be the
[14:14] same thing I if I gave you the chance if
[14:17] you had Argentinian Pesos right and I'm
[14:19] like do you want dollars instead you'd
[14:21] be like yeah you'd want to switch into
[14:23] the better money so that's what I'm
[14:24] doing with Bitcoin I'm just switching
[14:26] into the better money and I think
[14:28] semantics are really important actually
[14:29] like uh just me I think it's really
[14:31] important how how we how we frame things
[14:34] and how we uh say things uh that's why
[14:38] when I always like I even when when I
[14:42] talk with someone and he's like oh like
[14:44] you put all your money in Bitcoin I was
[14:46] like no I put all my financial energy
[14:48] into Bitcoin because putting money in
[14:51] Bitcoin would assume that Bitcoin is not
[14:53] money right it doesn't right it doesn't
[14:56] even make sense I'm not putting my money
[14:58] into M I'm that is my money Bitcoin is
[15:01] my
[15:01] money so so I think semantics may make a
[15:05] lot of uh difference um but how is how
[15:08] would H how are you seeing Bitcoin
[15:11] actually like obviously you have to know
[15:12] your audience if you're orange with
[15:14] someone but H how do you look at uh at
[15:16] Bitcoin uh there are people that say
[15:18] like oh like it's an asset oh no it's
[15:20] it's a way of life for me like there
[15:22] there's so many different Avenues you
[15:24] can look at Bitcoin how do you uh see it
[15:27] h well Bitcoin has definitely changed my
[15:29] life um significantly how I view the
[15:33] world I work in the Bitcoin world now I
[15:36] own a business that's all you know
[15:38] focused on bitcoin um I'm talking to you
[15:41] on a Bitcoin podcast so
[15:44] Bitcoin but so I'm cautious to call it a
[15:49] way of life because in the end
[15:52] Bitcoin is money which is a tool and
[15:57] it's still you know the important things
[15:59] life and not to get too sappy it's still
[16:01] like your family your friends you know
[16:04] how you treat other people so if
[16:06] bitcoin's your way of life and you are a
[16:09] shitty person you know it doesn't really
[16:11] matter that's it's your way of life it's
[16:13] a big part of my life I couldn't see
[16:16] myself uh not involved in the Bitcoin
[16:19] World in some way
[16:22] um
[16:24] I almost have my entire net worth in
[16:27] Bitcoin but I really kind of have and
[16:29] like when you think about it leveraged
[16:32] into Bitcoin as a sense cuz my business
[16:34] is DET is um affected by how Bitcoin
[16:38] does right I own a merchant apparel
[16:39] company that's Bitcoin themed stuff so
[16:41] if Bitcoin goes down usually that isn't
[16:43] great for people like getting all
[16:45] excited about like buying merge I work
[16:47] in the Bitcoin industry so bitcoin's
[16:50] going down that's not good for me so I'm
[16:52] like super attached to bitcoin I just
[16:56] have a little hard time calling it a way
[16:57] of life uh but it has definitely
[17:00] bettered my life significantly and you
[17:02] know it doesn't need to do that for
[17:05] everyone in such a massive way I I don't
[17:08] want to say it's like the Panacea for
[17:10] everybody where it's just going to fix
[17:11] everything for them
[17:15] but I don't know did I answer your
[17:16] question I feel like I've C in circles a
[17:18] little bit here it's for me it's also
[17:21] interesting uh and yeah you have have
[17:23] definitely as answer good question
[17:25] because um when we look at Bitcoin and
[17:28] how it it was like in the beginning of
[17:29] my podcast uh I wanted to start a
[17:33] Bitcoin podcast that just just like
[17:35] focused on like the the path of people
[17:37] into Bitcoin but that got boring after
[17:40] like 20 episodes uh but from that I know
[17:44] uh how actually Bitcoin changed a lot of
[17:47] lives but I always wonder how much of
[17:50] that is because we in a super early
[17:54] tribalistic energetic Community uh that
[17:57] I really passionate about it really
[17:59] early on and and such a revolution needs
[18:02] an extremely passionate extremely
[18:05] tribalistic Community to begin with to
[18:07] even even have a chance of of of of uh
[18:11] pulling that off uh and I think that's
[18:14] the that's that's where most of the
[18:17] Bitcoin has changed my life narrative
[18:19] comes from uh my guess and not that oh
[18:24] yeah I changed from like fear to bitcoin
[18:27] even though I think that's also
[18:29] contribution because your money just got
[18:32] better so your foundation of how you
[18:34] value your time how you value your uh
[18:37] Financial energy just got an upgrade but
[18:40] I don't think this magically fixes
[18:42] everything but your environment uh all
[18:45] of the sudden you are with uh passionate
[18:48] uh hopeful optimistic people this makes
[18:51] you passionate optimistic and and
[18:53] hopeful I think that's that's more of
[18:55] that and I hope we can take as much from
[18:57] that early community
[18:59] towards uh the whole life
[19:03] but my realistic me as like oh yeah we
[19:06] are just in a very small community and
[19:08] it will not be the whole
[19:09] world yeah I mean you know it's weird
[19:13] because a lot of people when you say
[19:15] there's a Bitcoin Community they go
[19:16] there is no Bitcoin Community right like
[19:18] it's a decentralized thing everyone
[19:20] comes to it from their perspective I've
[19:24] made I've made amazing friends in the
[19:27] Bitcoin world I've connected with a lot
[19:28] of people people but still your Bitcoin
[19:30] Journey has to start with you
[19:32] understanding Bitcoin and building your
[19:34] own conviction because when bitcoin's
[19:36] volatile and you're you're first
[19:38] learning about Bitcoin no one's going to
[19:39] be there most likely to like hold your
[19:41] hand and like bail you out and get you
[19:43] through it you have to really understand
[19:45] what you own
[19:47] so the it being tribal or Community
[19:52] Based
[19:54] um you know there is there's something
[19:57] to that but ultimately
[19:59] it's about individuality and taking on
[20:03] responsibility for yourself to really
[20:05] understand Bitcoin
[20:09] um and yeah that's
[20:13] really the the aspect of
[20:17] uh no nobody holds their hand is
[20:19] interesting because um when you look
[20:22] back at the last cycle I think the last
[20:25] cycle was the cycle where all those
[20:27] Bitcoin only content kind of formed
[20:29] before 2020 there was not as much
[20:32] Bitcoin only content and now it seems
[20:34] like there's so much Bitcoin only
[20:35] content uh or you disagree yeah I I
[20:40] don't want to say there aren't like s
[20:42] like resources to help people think
[20:44] things through but ultimately you're the
[20:45] one making the decisions that's really
[20:48] what I mean like you are the one that
[20:51] you know if if the last you know four
[20:55] years has been the first time for you
[20:57] into Bitcoin you're you're the one that
[20:59] was buying Bitcoin uh maybe a 50 and
[21:01] 60,000 and then watched it go all the
[21:04] way to 16,000 and no matter how much
[21:07] other people say oh it's going to be
[21:09] okay you know everything's going to be
[21:10] fine Bitcoin you know this is just what
[21:12] Bitcoin does if you don't have the
[21:13] mental model yourself uh it doesn't
[21:16] really matter what other people say so I
[21:20] I always tell people when they ask um
[21:22] and they're new like how much Bitcoin
[21:24] should I buy and I my my first answer is
[21:27] always you shouldn't buy any because if
[21:29] you have to to ask that question you're
[21:31] not
[21:32] ready um and then they always push back
[21:34] obviously and I'll be like okay maybe
[21:36] like 1% of your net worth or something
[21:39] I'll you know I'll throw them a bone
[21:40] there but ultimately like you're not
[21:41] ready to take a big position in
[21:43] something like this if you don't
[21:45] understand it if you don't if you don't
[21:47] understand that this is like you said uh
[21:51] historical moment sort of speak right
[21:53] this is a a
[21:55] revolutionary uh
[21:56] money um
[21:59] that you know how many humans live
[22:02] towards the moneti live during the
[22:04] monetization of a new asset like this uh
[22:07] you know gold thousands and thousands of
[22:10] years ago uh but this is completely
[22:12] different in a lot of ways obviously it
[22:16] it feels um like
[22:19] like maybe it feels for me like it's U
[22:23] more impactful or more meaningful but
[22:26] maybe that's just because I live now
[22:28] here uh but yeah it's it's it's
[22:30] something uh huge it's it's a once- in a
[22:33] generation thing definitely like if you
[22:36] have in in every generation something
[22:39] that's big um that's that's now our
[22:42] thing like that that that's I believe
[22:45] the the thing of this generation uh that
[22:48] will change a lot that not a lot of
[22:50] people uh have on their radar I mean
[22:52] there all there are a lot of other other
[22:54] big things like the internet itself uh
[22:57] yeah a lot of people see but I I almost
[23:01] feel like Bitcoin is is more fundamental
[23:04] because it's money and not just
[23:05] information even even though information
[23:07] is uh extremely important uh but that
[23:11] that that's that's how I look at it at
[23:14] least for for for the Bitcoin Revolution
[23:16] one thing that I was wondering also um
[23:19] when when you talked about uh currencies
[23:22] that are inflating uh more and we kind
[23:25] of have to like when when we talk about
[23:27] in Europe or in in the in the states
[23:30] with inflation it's not that obvious
[23:31] that's it's a big problem it's like a
[23:33] slow uh hidden problem um I I'm shocked
[23:38] that the the world Reserve currency is
[23:41] one of the first countries to have a
[23:44] president that is talking positive about
[23:47] Bitcoin and it's not so many other like
[23:51] African leaders Indian leaders and and
[23:54] other countries leaders I mean we have
[23:55] nuk we have pan we have small uh places
[23:58] like that but I'm shocked that such a
[24:02] privileged place like the United States
[24:05] uh is is is kind of the one of the
[24:07] leading countries in in that uh kind of
[24:10] defeats the argument of like um the
[24:14] countries that need it the most will
[24:16] will adopt it first yeah
[24:19] I I've I people come to bitcoin for
[24:22] multiple reasons like generally it's
[24:24] either out of like greed um and
[24:27] curiosity or
[24:29] necessity um and I know you mentioned
[24:31] you know some like lesser developed
[24:33] countries being like why wouldn't they
[24:34] come to it first but a lot of these
[24:36] lesser developed countries the people at
[24:38] the top you know there's it's a lot like
[24:40] there's a lot of dictatorships and
[24:41] authoritarian type like regimes you know
[24:44] the people at the top are doing fine uh
[24:46] there so they have like no incentive to
[24:48] really up upend what they have going on
[24:53] um as long as like their life's okay um
[24:55] as far as the us being the leader yeah
[24:57] it does seem a little ironic
[24:58] but at the same
[25:00] time most of the capital in the world
[25:03] like comes to the US still people feel
[25:06] safe putting their money in bringing
[25:08] money into the US so it's no surprise
[25:10] that you know a lot
[25:12] of the the money is coming from the US
[25:15] because that's where most of it is right
[25:17] um most of the investment world most of
[25:20] investment activity happens in the US so
[25:22] it's it's not surprising that us
[25:25] persons um would be lobbying their
[25:28] leaders to start adopting
[25:31] Bitcoin so we'll see are we now at the
[25:34] point where where Bitcoin kind of has to
[25:35] work like Bitcoin is it's like I it has
[25:39] to work or like that there's some major
[25:41] black one I mean it does work um I don't
[25:45] about having to work it does work right
[25:49] every 10 minutes new blocks REM
[25:52] mind um on average there's it's been had
[25:56] 100% uptime for the past like 12 years
[26:00] or something since 2013 maybe there was
[26:02] a little blip where it didn't 11 years
[26:05] it does work does it do everything that
[26:08] everyone wants it to do today no will it
[26:12] do everything everyone wants it to do in
[26:15] the future
[26:16] necessarily maybe not on the Bas layer
[26:19] uh but that's for smarter people than me
[26:22] to figure out how to make it work I just
[26:26] understand why this technology is so
[26:28] valuable and why appreciation of this
[26:32] asset seems
[26:34] inevitable um in terms of how it's all
[26:37] going to play out in terms
[26:39] of which nations adopted first which if
[26:43] the us if all Fiat will fail if Bitcoin
[26:47] will become the world Reserve currency
[26:50] you know I it's hard to really say one
[26:52] topic that I really want to also get
[26:53] into with you uh as you have a company
[26:56] in in the Bitcoin space um how on the
[27:00] one side it was for you like founding
[27:02] something in Bitcoin uh and then also
[27:05] the impact of that like let's first like
[27:08] uh start with like how did it came that
[27:10] you went ahead and Bitcoin was such a
[27:13] big passion of yours that you don't only
[27:14] want to just like hold it but also like
[27:17] actually contribute something to the
[27:19] space how did that come to be yeah so
[27:21] it's like kind of like a long journey
[27:24] um in 2013 I first bought Bitcoin uh I
[27:28] didn't understand it um it was like $120
[27:31] per Bitcoin it like tripled and I sold
[27:33] it um paid attention got back in in like
[27:37] 2015 through 2017 went down trading like
[27:41] the altcoin rabbit hole which is a Bad
[27:43] Rabbit Hole to go down but it was a less
[27:46] you know a a lesson well learned um I
[27:49] kind of really refocused on bitcoin and
[27:52] of 2019 I listened to some podcasts one
[27:56] was uh Bitcoin Ina um he did like a
[28:01] four-part series on bitcoin magazine I
[28:03] read Jeff Booth's book in early 2020 the
[28:06] price of tomorrow and I'm like holy crap
[28:08] like you this thing's been staring you
[28:10] in the face for years and you didn't get
[28:13] it and then all of a sudden I started
[28:15] like kind of putting all my net worth um
[28:17] into Bitcoin slowly and steady anytime
[28:19] I'd listen to a podcast more of my
[28:21] wealth would go into Bitcoin like every
[28:22] single time I like I don't have enough
[28:24] of this then I started I wanted to tell
[28:27] all my friends about it right when you
[28:28] you think you know you could help the
[28:30] people around you not everyone wants to
[28:32] listen so I'm like all right where am I
[28:33] going to talk about it so I went on on
[28:35] Twitter uh because that's where like
[28:38] most of the conversation was and just
[28:41] started talking to people about Bitcoin
[28:42] started people started connecting with
[28:44] me and following
[28:46] me uh by early
[28:48] 2021 uh the company Swan Bitcoin the CEO
[28:51] Corey reached reached out to me um I
[28:56] started running clubhous rooms for them
[28:59] in 2021 hold on I got to take a sip of
[29:01] water sorry a sip of my soda actually
[29:03] it's not water um and then in early
[29:08] 2022 I start I had a lot of exposure at
[29:11] that point in the Bitcoin world my now
[29:13] business partner Ryan reached out to me
[29:16] about founding fomo 21 hold on S excuse
[29:21] me have a little
[29:23] cough and he's like Neil I've been
[29:27] following you and in the space
[29:31] for a year or two now and I've been in
[29:35] the merch and apparel space for over 20
[29:37] years I'd love to do this in the Bitcoin
[29:39] world with
[29:40] you so we talked and I'm like I'm in so
[29:44] him and I have built this company over
[29:47] the past two and a half years we've
[29:49] shipped Goods to over 60 countries and
[29:53] yeah I have like a really fun time with
[29:55] it I tell people I get to bring memes to
[29:57] real life right I get to put memes on
[29:59] t-shirts so you know I never saw myself
[30:03] as someone who was going to become you
[30:05] know a developer
[30:07] or you know submit some Bitcoin
[30:10] Improvement proposal but if I could like
[30:12] touch people in a little way everywhere
[30:15] I could um I was like all right well
[30:18] this merch thing sounds cool and people
[30:20] all around the world will be wearing
[30:21] Bitcoin stuff it will start
[30:24] conversations and it's really cool now
[30:26] you know I go to conferences I see
[30:28] people wearing our stuff um yeah it's
[30:31] it's been an awesome experience in terms
[30:33] of like starting a business in the
[30:35] Bitcoin space I partnered up with coin

[32:51] if you if you would have to like pick
[32:54] one like if you would have to like uh
[32:56] like one meme over all the other ones
[32:59] what is what is your favorite your best
[33:01] meme that that you like like the most oh
[33:05] my God that's such a difficult question
[33:07] there's so many out there right they're
[33:10] all my my children all these memes no um
[33:14] I don't know if I have like one favorite
[33:16] obviously like hoddle is a very
[33:18] important meme I think Matt Odell you
[33:20] know stay humble Staats I think he's the
[33:22] one that came up with that I think
[33:24] that's important just to kind of be
[33:25] humble through this journey you know
[33:28] there's a point where you and me we
[33:31] didn't understand Bitcoin at one point
[33:33] you know and you gota you gota
[33:35] everyone's on their own kind of path so
[33:38] just kind of and and knowing how
[33:40] volatile it is you know it's not always
[33:42] going to be uh up and to the right in
[33:45] terms of bitcoin's uh price chart so
[33:47] that one's
[33:48] important you know they've all the memes
[33:51] they've all had like a different impact
[33:53] on me you know that there was a in terms
[33:57] of our merch business one of the most
[33:59] impactful memes off the bat was when the
[34:02] New York Post back in like 2021 or 2022
[34:06] sorry they came out with a an article
[34:08] that says study finds majority of
[34:10] Bitcoin bitcoiners are
[34:13] psychopaths so I made a t-shirt Bitcoin
[34:16] psychopath and I was first teaching
[34:18] myself graphic design back then put the
[34:20] shirt on the site people loved it I
[34:22] actually spelled the word psychopath
[34:24] wrong at first and I like flipped two of
[34:26] the letters uh and I said to people oh
[34:29] I'm sorry I'll send you like the new one
[34:30] they're like no we love it because it
[34:32] makes us look crazy and more like
[34:33] Psychopaths that it's like spelled wrong
[34:36] so that was like the first meme that
[34:38] like I went on a T-shirt and like got a
[34:41] lot of action on our site so yeah
[34:43] there's a lot of cool stories like that
[34:45] and I'm just really like thankful that
[34:49] you
[34:49] know things have happen for me uh in the
[34:53] Bitcoin world where I get to have fun
[34:55] and have a good time um
[34:58] and it allows me to increase my Bitcoin
[35:01] position it allows me to increase the
[35:04] the network I have and the friends I
[35:06] have so I'm really thankful for all that
[35:09] I I love that and it kind
[35:11] of uh uh gives away my my my second
[35:15] question already but it's it's uh like
[35:17] the the impact that a Bitcoin business
[35:20] had on you one thing that also I'm
[35:23] really curious is like if you have
[35:26] Bitcoin in your business uh and you
[35:29] obviously have it as a treasury strategy
[35:31] also it it kind of moves up the hurdle
[35:34] rate like if you're a fear business and
[35:36] and your cash is like just parked in in
[35:40] feeld uh and maybe you have some bonds
[35:43] or like some other strategies uh
[35:45] whatever you have as a company outside
[35:47] of Bitcoin uh you really incentivized to
[35:50] like spend money like let's have there
[35:53] are some marketing opportunity let's
[35:54] let's just like buy that small company
[35:56] but uh even though maybe that is a
[35:59] decision and maybe even like it's a bad
[36:01] decision uh but if you have Bitcoin as a
[36:03] hurdle rate it's kind of hard to hard to
[36:05] beat Bitcoin because it's do like the
[36:08] 100% the last five years uh and it might
[36:12] keep doing that so how do you look at a
[36:15] business from like do I spend now
[36:17] Bitcoin uh for this marketing campaign
[36:20] or like is it better to keep the Bitcoin
[36:22] and grow more organically how do you go
[36:24] ahead as a business and decide where to
[36:26] spend your Bitcoin and how will that
[36:28] also impact uh businesses in the future
[36:31] yeah what I would say is fortunately for
[36:34] our business um because I have built up
[36:38] like my own following on uh Twitter and
[36:42] social media and general you know I have
[36:47] distribution channels to Market that
[36:48] don't cost us anything uh me and my
[36:51] partner
[36:52] actually uh put basically no money into
[36:56] the business it s funded itself like
[36:59] right off the bat uh which is pretty
[37:01] remarkable so we haven't really had that
[37:03] challenge of oh should we put money into
[37:06] the business um or is it better off just
[37:09] buying
[37:10] Bitcoin uh
[37:12] because most of the marketing has been
[37:14] on my social media which is free I mean
[37:18] obviously it's my time um and I don't
[37:20] just let anyone do that but in terms of
[37:22] like my own business it's not like
[37:23] costing us anything for me to say hey we
[37:26] have this new t-shirt this this new
[37:28] Bitcoin psychopath t-shirt you know come
[37:30] and buy it
[37:33] um yeah it's a decision everyone has to
[37:35] make if you're really
[37:36] passionate about building a business you
[37:40] should do it because you know like again
[37:43] what I said earlier Bitcoin it's just a
[37:45] tool it's you know money is just a tool
[37:49] and if there's a way you want to add
[37:51] value to society and something that
[37:53] you're going to that that you feel
[37:56] passionate about um do it you know you
[37:59] you don't know when those opportunities
[38:01] will will leave and there will always be
[38:04] chances um for you to keep accumulating
[38:08] Bitcoin maybe not at at the uh the price
[38:11] you'd like
[38:13] but ultimately what are you going to
[38:15] just like sit with your Bitcoin and
[38:16] never like enjoy life and do things um
[38:20] like create businesses that you're proud
[38:22] of if the sole purpose of your business
[38:24] is I just want to make money um you know
[38:28] then maybe just hold Bitcoin like what's
[38:30] you know but it it should be something
[38:32] where you're excited about going to work
[38:35] every day and something that gives you
[38:37] Joy absolutely uh someone actually asked
[38:40] me that I think a week ago or something
[38:42] like that uh and he was pondering around
[38:45] the question of like he has a good
[38:46] paying job and he can stack actually a
[38:49] lot every every month but he's not as
[38:51] happy with the job and he really wants
[38:53] to go ahead and do his own thing uh and
[38:55] he kind of was like in this in between
[38:57] like do I stack now more because Bitcoin
[39:00] has a big opportunity and if I leave
[39:03] that now maybe uh I have to invest some
[39:05] of my Bitcoin to that and and go
[39:08] something for something big and I was
[39:09] like Hey like that first of all like
[39:11] it's not my decision but uh I always go
[39:14] with the gut I always go where uh my
[39:17] emotional Robin would go uh maybe that's
[39:20] a bad decision but that's just like how
[39:22] how I work and how this podcast actually
[39:24] came to be uh and uh I think it's it's
[39:28] it's hard where you have this
[39:29] opportunity because yes always go ahead
[39:31] yeah and I don't want to say like it's a
[39:33] one-size fits all situation you know
[39:35] everyone's got to ultimately make their
[39:37] own decision but as you said like you
[39:39] said going with your gut um ultimately
[39:42] the only things I've really regretted is
[39:44] when I don't go with my gut so you know
[39:49] go with your gut absolutely and I think
[39:52] the the I always try to feel like okay
[39:55] in in like 20 years when you look back
[39:57] at that you probably regret more uh not
[40:00] doing it even if it fails like you can
[40:03] look back and like at least I try like
[40:05] at least I that's what you and you'll
[40:07] learn and you'll learn from that right
[40:09] like you you learn more from your fail
[40:11] failures than you do your
[40:12] successes absolutely um one one question
[40:16] on the topic uh is like when when all
[40:20] the businesses all of the sudden
[40:22] have a money that they have to use like
[40:26] in the scenario where Bitcoin is
[40:27] actually like really widespread what
[40:30] impact do you think that overall will
[40:32] have on like the startup World Venture
[40:34] Capital world uh maybe on the on the
[40:36] business sides uh overall when we have
[40:39] Bitcoin as the the new hurdle rate maybe
[40:42] it's not going up 2x every year because
[40:45] it will be widespread and maybe it's
[40:47] just going up but it is going up uh in
[40:50] purchasing power and not going down as
[40:52] as feat yeah I'm not like an expert in
[40:54] this area what I would say is with with
[40:57] any investment in life you're always
[40:59] thinking about opportunity costs right
[41:01] like can I make if you're an investor
[41:04] can I make more money just holding
[41:06] Bitcoin or should I invest in another
[41:08] company clearly people like Michael saor
[41:11] think I'm just gonna hold Bitcoin I'm
[41:13] just going to keep accumulating Bitcoin
[41:15] this is the better play um you know if
[41:18] we lived in a world where there W
[41:20] Bitcoin was the only money people would
[41:22] have to be really certain that they
[41:23] wanted a part with their Bitcoin um as
[41:26] something that can will continue
[41:28] indefinitely to appreciate and value and
[41:31] you can't print more of it and no one's
[41:32] there to bail you out right there's no
[41:34] like Bitcoin printer um there's only
[41:37] ever going to be 21 million or almost 21
[41:40] million I guess technically
[41:42] so yeah I think it it just goes to
[41:47] bitcoin will force people to make
[41:49] smarter decisions and the people who
[41:51] make dumb
[41:52] decisions uh on investing in businesses
[41:55] they're the Bitcoin will will leave
[41:58] their hands but that could make for a
[41:59] better Society because maybe we'll have
[42:02] um better Capital allocators uh holding
[42:05] the money absolutely I I hope I hope we
[42:10] have we come to a point where we have
[42:13] more
[42:14] quality uh overall I think that if if I
[42:18] have one hope what happens to the
[42:20] business world with Bitcoin it's like
[42:22] more quality and uh let's not just like
[42:27] like move fast and break
[42:29] things uh I mean still try a lot of
[42:32] things out not not be afraid but uh
[42:35] maybe with a little bit more quality not
[42:37] like yeah let's just throw money at at
[42:39] Thousand startups uh and and see what if
[42:42] if one
[42:43] sticks yeah it'll definitely take a lot
[42:46] of
[42:47] inefficiencies and out of the system I
[42:50] do Wonder like you said though if maybe
[42:53] the whole grow fast break things you
[42:55] know if that creates some opportunities
[42:57] for people who wouldn't have had them
[42:59] but I think ultimately like Bitcoin
[43:01] produces a more Merit based society
[43:03] where the the great ideas will went out
[43:05] so I I think it's a net positive
[43:07] actually for sure absolutely yeah really
[43:10] cool uh one question I ask all of my
[43:13] guest is what can we learn from you uh
[43:15] besides Bitcoin what can you learn from
[43:17] me besides
[43:19] Bitcoin
[43:21] um I would just say like my
[43:25] life had has not been a straight line
[43:30] like there's ups and downs you really
[43:33] you think you have it like you think you
[43:35] know where things are going and if you
[43:37] would have told me just 5 years ago that
[43:39] I'd be sitting on your podcast right now
[43:41] I'd be like what I have nothing to do
[43:44] with the Bitcoin world like what what
[43:46] does that have to do with me like I'm
[43:47] not going to be on this person's podcast
[43:49] so just be open um keep an open mind
[43:53] realize what you think you know may not
[43:55] be so and realize everyone else is on
[43:57] their own Journey going through their
[43:59] own experiences and maybe be a little
[44:03] less quick to judge and a you know be a
[44:06] little more kinder to our fellow human
[44:09] beings was was Bitcoin for you um a big
[44:13] positive turning point oh yeah for sure
[44:17] I
[44:18] mean it it destroyed a lot of the
[44:22] previous like mental models I've had
[44:24] about how the world
[44:25] Works um in terms of economics Finance
[44:29] markets in terms of valuing time and the
[44:32] way we interact with each
[44:34] other so yeah it definitely it had a big
[44:38] impact on me and a very positive impact
[44:40] on me and it's that that's what I keep
[44:43] hearing I I have a lot of hope uh that's
[44:45] one reason why I have a lot of Hope for
[44:48] uh for the future world because I just
[44:49] like he like oh people discover Bitcoin
[44:52] people will discover a lot of Bitcoin
[44:54] and all those people who are discovering
[44:56] Bitcoin they have like some positive
[44:58] with it uh but yeah really cool perfect
[45:01] then we have an end routine in the
[45:02] podcast where the previous guest is
[45:04] asking a question for the next guest
[45:05] without knowing who the next guest
[45:07] actually is uh and the previous guest
[45:10] asked a question for you what is the
[45:12] most difficult topic to understand about
[45:15] Bitcoin
[45:16] H what is the most difficult topic that
[45:19] I now understand because there's still
[45:22] some topics I'm not like an expert in I
[45:25] think under under this is going to sound
[45:27] like a copout answer but I think it's
[45:30] like understand understanding this is
[45:32] important is you're never going to be an
[45:35] expert on everything in the Bitcoin
[45:38] space so yeah I guess that really
[45:40] doesn't answer your question about like
[45:42] could you could you ask the question one
[45:44] more
[45:45] time um maybe I rephrase it a little bit
[45:49] um what do you think uh when when people
[45:52] come into Bitcoin what topic are people
[45:55] struggling the most to
[45:58] I think I think a phrasing of the
[46:00] question well I think most people think
[46:02] they understand money and they have no
[46:04] clue about
[46:05] money so that is the first huge barrier
[46:09] is what is money once you answer that
[46:12] question you can really fall down the
[46:15] Bitcoin rabbit hole but until you just
[46:17] understand what money is um admittedly I
[46:20] didn't understand what money was until
[46:23] you know I was in my 30s right like
[46:26] which is crazy because it's something we
[46:27] just grow up with and deal with every
[46:29] day but we don't really think about it
[46:31] like oh it buys us stuff uh things go up
[46:34] in price over time uh because of
[46:37] inflation but we don't really know you
[46:38] know what what that means it's just kind
[46:40] of like built
[46:41] in uh to society so it's just I don't
[46:45] know if it's the topic people struggle
[46:47] with it's just a topic they don't even
[46:49] know they need to know and that they
[46:52] don't that they it's a topic they don't
[46:54] even know that they don't know I know
[46:56] that might the word of that might be
[46:57] confusing but yeah it's like the the
[47:00] example with the fish right like the one
[47:02] fish is like oh water is is wild today
[47:04] and data fish is like what is water uh
[47:07] and I think we we handle with with with
[47:10] money all the time that it's so like of
[47:14] course I know what money is like here
[47:16] like here's a $1 bill like that's money
[47:19] uh but they don't really ask like okay
[47:21] like is that even money like where does
[47:23] money come from what is money how is it
[47:26] uh made and how does it come to me and
[47:28] so like uh it's it's it's it's really
[47:30] interesting for me when you when I look
[47:32] at that uh that question and you said
[47:35] like oh till my early 30s but there's a
[47:39] Michael sailor who said in the beginning
[47:41] and his orange orange buing Journey that
[47:43] he with Bitcoin first asks the question
[47:46] what is money uh and he was 55 when he
[47:50] came into Bitcoin uh and he was the C
[47:54] the longest serving CEO of a a publicly
[47:58] traded it company or something like that
[47:59] so like like a guy you assume knows
[48:04] quite well how the financial system
[48:05] works but he never asked himself
[48:08] apparently as he uh self declared uh
[48:11] never what what money actually is so uh
[48:14] it's like not knowing in your f is what
[48:17] money is it it seems to be not that bad
[48:20] but you should ask that question
[48:23] absolutely uh a a lot of people uh
[48:25] should ask the question also always
[48:27] interesting when you ask people in the
[48:30] AR like what is that even yeah really
[48:33] cool thank you so much uh Neil for for
[48:35] being on the podcast uh before I let you
[48:37] go where can people find you reach out

[49:12] uh I will be even uh speaking there
[49:14] actually oh awesome yeah so like uh I
[49:18] was first time ever a speaker at a
[49:21] conference in Amsterdam was completely
[49:23] overwhelmed because I never stood in a I
[49:26] never stood on a stage with more than 50
[49:28] people and those crazy people from
[49:31] Bitcoin magazine put me on the main
[49:33] stage as a
[49:35] moderator so that that was a new thing
[49:38] and I will be in Abu Dhabi also uh if if
[49:40] you also there in in Abu Dhabi I will be
[49:43] and I'm actually going in four days to
[49:46] El Salvador to adopting Bitcoin I'm
[49:49] really looking forward to that because I
[49:50] never was in in in El
[49:53] Salvador awesome have fun they're lucky
[49:56] to have you
[49:57] uh it's uh it's something that I
[49:59] encourage everyone to do like uh going
[50:01] to conferences uh I think that's the one
[50:04] thing that made everything that I now
[50:08] have uh with Bitcoin and the podcast and
[50:12] speaking at conferences possible because
[50:14] I went two years before at Bitcoin brag
[50:17] at that conference uh that was the first
[50:19] one the first bigger one that I was so I
[50:21] always encourage people like hey go to
[50:23] conferences like if you if you can make
[50:25] it go there if you financially cannot
[50:28] make it at least go to local Meetup
[50:30] they're always there they're free uh and
[50:32] meet other bitcoiners in real life it's
[50:33] really a game changer was it also
[50:36] something big for you sorry again say
[50:38] again was the uh Bitcoin conferences and
[50:41] going there also something uh um
[50:44] impactful for you oh yeah I mean I've
[50:47] it's great going uh seeing people who
[50:49] you know they're only internet people
[50:51] until you meet them in real life uh you
[50:53] make great friendships good
[50:54] relationships if you want to break into
[50:56] the industry it's a great way to start
[50:59] so yeah um I'll be I I don't plan on
[51:01] being in Abu Dhabi um or El Salvador but
[51:05] Vegas is next on my list so hope to see
