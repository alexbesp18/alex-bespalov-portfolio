[00:00] idea that Bitcoin versus not Bitcoin
[00:02] we're going to have more storms or less
[00:04] storms it's totally ridiculous we're
[00:05] much closer to the coldest time in the
[00:08] last 600 million years than the warmest
[00:10] time right now we are in an ice age
[00:12] because we have ice at the poles so
[00:14] officially we're in an ice age right now
[00:15] you can tax people in many different
[00:17] ways you can have a cbdc then you can
[00:20] control how much meat everybody gets to
[00:22] eat you've had too much meat this month
[00:24] you can't buy anymore you've flown too
[00:25] much this year you can't fly anymore the
[00:27] whole idea that if you emit more Co two
[00:30] we're going to have more storms or more
[00:32] floods or droughts or fires there's
[00:33] nothing in the data at all to support
[00:35] any of that truth is going to win out
[00:37] and it is winning out now but it's an
[00:39] amazing time of Hysteria we don't have
[00:41] CO2 in the air we all die we have to
[00:43] have it there so the fight against CO2
[00:45] is like fighting oxygen or it's like
[00:47] fighting water it's just a critical part
[00:49] of our life I do think that the whole
[00:51] money printing thing is affecting
[00:52] everything including the forever Wars
[00:54] and they forever war against carbon
[00:56] dioxide there's this idea you can just
[00:57] point at bad weather and say ah this
[00:59] proves that Co 2 causes bad weather but
[01:01] it's never true this whole printing of
[01:03] money is just such an evil thing for
[01:05] Humanity so much misallocated Capital it
[01:08] just uh kind of makes me sick this whole
[01:10] idea of free money that governments
[01:12] can't use for forever Wars again it
[01:14] makes me really happy I have I have high
[01:16] hopes for it and I'm a fan and I I'm
[01:18] orange
[01:19] [Music]
[01:21] pilled today we have really an
[01:24] interesting and very focused topic uh I
[01:26] think climate uh and especially with
[01:28] Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining I think those
[01:30] are like really interesting uh views
[01:33] that we can get into but before we get
[01:35] into climate and Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[01:37] mining and all those things I have one
[01:39] question that I'm asking myself a lot uh
[01:43] and this is a common theme around my
[01:44] podcast where I ask my guess a lot what
[01:47] sound money has has an impact on society
[01:50] and I was
[01:51] wondering if sound money has an impact
[01:56] on climate and on our weather and on our
[01:58] current situation in in in on Earth like
[02:02] on the climate if this has any impact on
[02:05] climate or or doesn't or does the Earth
[02:08] uh don't care about uh what money we use
[02:11] as human
[02:12] beings yeah that's a great question and
[02:14] the Earth does not care what type of
[02:16] money we use I say that no matter what
[02:19] we do if we spend $50 trillion do on the
[02:22] climate thing and I'll go live in caves
[02:24] it's not going to make any measurable
[02:26] effect on weather or climate ever so the
[02:28] whole idea that Bitcoin versus not
[02:30] Bitcoin is we're going to have more
[02:32] storms or less storms it's totally
[02:33] ridiculous it's not happening yeah I
[02:36] thought so but I just want to get this
[02:38] out of the way because I think a lot of
[02:39] people argue argue that even in Bitcoin
[02:41] I think people are like oh this fixes
[02:43] that and fixes that it's not like really
[02:45] cool um one other topic with Bitcoin and
[02:48] climate um a lot of people say like oh
[02:51] Bitcoin mining it consumes so much
[02:52] energy it's bad for the clim it's bad
[02:54] from the environment this this is a
[02:56] common F that we we always get um is the
[02:59] is there anything to it from from your
[03:02] perspective uh no from my perspective
[03:04] there's nothing to it again the whole
[03:06] idea that if you emit more CO2 we're
[03:09] going to have more storms or more floods
[03:11] or droughts or fires there's nothing in
[03:13] the data at all to support any of that
[03:15] so it it's all uh fear it's all fud it's
[03:19] not true at all interesting yeah perfect
[03:22] then let's get into the the real
[03:24] question um you sent me a picture really
[03:26] interesting one where you listed I think
[03:28] five or six
[03:30] uh that that are commonly known around
[03:33] the climate uh and I just wanted to get
[03:37] that out of the way and get like those
[03:39] into the discussion and the first one is
[03:42] a really interesting one the Earth is
[03:44] too hot is that something that that you
[03:46] get a lot at least I hear it a lot is is
[03:49] that why is that not true yeah I mean
[03:52] we're supposed to believe right now that
[03:53] the Earth is too hot but we're told that
[03:56] the uh global average temperature is
[03:57] maybe 59 degrees F height or something
[04:00] uh the whole idea that uh the warming
[04:03] since 1850 has caused the Earth to get
[04:05] too hot there's just nothing uh that
[04:08] supports that and even right now we're
[04:10] told that cold kills maybe 10 times as
[04:14] many people as heat in the earth so the
[04:17] whole idea that we want the Earth to be
[04:18] colder if we care about humans we should
[04:21] want the Earth to be warmer and uh warm
[04:23] times have always been better for uh
[04:25] humans and for life on Earth than cold
[04:27] times so there's nothing wrong with the
[04:30] Earth's temperature right now and the
[04:31] whole idea that we want to go back to
[04:33] 1850 when it was colder we don't we had
[04:35] shorter growing seasons and it wasn't as
[04:38] good a time to be on earth when it when
[04:39] it's cold as when it's warm is it
[04:41] getting hotter is like is is it or is it
[04:44] getting hotter on on Earth yeah that's a
[04:47] great question and uh depends on your
[04:49] starting point so it is warmer now than
[04:51] it was in 1850 and it's warmer now than
[04:53] it was in 1975 so you could say it's
[04:55] warming if you use those starting points
[04:57] but there's a lot of other starting
[04:59] points in past that were much warmer
[05:01] than it is now it was warmer 4,000 years
[05:04] ago and you can tell that by looking at
[05:06] the tree lines the tree lines were
[05:08] further north in the Arctic 4,000 years
[05:11] ago than now and of course there were a
[05:13] lot of humans were alive 4,000 years ago
[05:15] and it was warmer then and and there was
[05:17] nothing wrong with that and um over the
[05:20] last 600 million years it's been much
[05:22] warmer than now for most of that time
[05:24] we're much closer to the coldest time in
[05:27] the last 600 million years than the
[05:29] warmer time right now and we are in an
[05:31] ice age because we have ice at the poles
[05:33] so officially we're in an ice age right
[05:35] now so yeah the whole idea that it's too
[05:38] hot right now we're a tropical species
[05:40] uh humans like to live where it's warm
[05:42] we like to vacation and retire where
[05:44] it's warm so the whole idea that oh no
[05:47] the Earth is too hot right now not
[05:49] supported by any evidence oh that's
[05:52] that's that that's crazy that that we
[05:53] are living in an ice age I never I think
[05:55] I never heard that one it's interesting
[05:59] um is it is other Cycles normal and can
[06:02] can we even do something against those
[06:04] Cycles like even if we really if the
[06:07] whole world all humans are like let's
[06:08] get it colder warmer could we even um
[06:12] influence those getting warmer and
[06:14] getting colder
[06:15] Cycles yeah another great question and
[06:18] the earth's climate is so complicated
[06:21] that there's just tons of cycles that
[06:23] are super imposed on each other there's
[06:24] really long-term cycles and short-term
[06:26] ones and I've had some people on my
[06:28] podcast talking about this that it looks
[06:30] like there's these cycles of various
[06:32] lengths and sometimes they all line up
[06:34] so it gets really warm and sometimes
[06:35] they line up so it gets cold but it's
[06:37] they're not perfect cycles and we can't
[06:39] predict in advance exactly exactly
[06:41] what's going to happen uh so humans can
[06:44] affect their local weather and climate
[06:46] by stuff that we do like right around a
[06:48] city uh locally you can affect it but
[06:50] the whole idea that we can do stuff and
[06:52] we're going to cool the entire planets
[06:53] or warm the entire planet we can try
[06:56] that but uh we can try it with
[06:57] geoengineering Etc but still all these
[07:00] other really complicated things are
[07:02] still happening no matter what we do
[07:03] it's the whole idea that we just can um
[07:06] consider oursel as turning a thermostat
[07:08] and just adjusting the temperature of
[07:10] the whole planet that's a kind of a
[07:12] dream but it's not something that we
[07:14] should even try to do I think is that
[07:16] the the human brain thinking it's it's
[07:19] it's too big I feel like sometimes the
[07:22] human body and the and the pun
[07:25] psychology if it's like oh like we are
[07:27] so important and we can do a lot of the
[07:29] world and but yeah we are just like
[07:30] really small items in the bigger
[07:32] universe and there are bigger forces
[07:34] than us yeah I think that's some Modern
[07:36] thinking that you can just change the
[07:37] thermostat in the room you're in and it
[07:40] the temperature can be adjusted to what
[07:42] you want so people think why can't we
[07:43] just do that outside of our house too
[07:45] but you can't can't but why but why do
[07:48] you think uh we hearing those uh oh
[07:51] we're in a climate crisis we have to
[07:53] stop driving with the car because
[07:55] otherwise it gets too hot we have to
[07:56] cool down the climate like all those
[07:59] those are really really really represent
[08:01] like really big in in mainstream media
[08:04] and if you go out in the
[08:05] streets yeah so the late Charlie Munger
[08:08] called it a laa paloa effect that
[08:10] there's all these different incentives
[08:12] that are uh pushing people in One
[08:14] Direction so like the media for example
[08:17] uh it's really exciting if they can say
[08:19] that the Earth is too hot and whatever
[08:21] just happened is unprecedented it's it's
[08:23] super exciting and uh it might get you
[08:26] more clicks or sell more papers or
[08:27] whatever so that's one thing and then if
[08:30] you're a climate scientist or just a
[08:32] scientist in general and right now if
[08:34] you want funding for like butterfly
[08:36] research people use that as an example
[08:38] you might not get funding if you just
[08:39] want to research butterflies but if you
[08:41] say I want to research the effect of
[08:43] climate on butterflies then you're much
[08:45] like more likely to get funding if you
[08:47] just put climate in there you put some
[08:49] climate speak in there as Steve Coan
[08:51] says so there's that and then I think a
[08:55] lot of people are just motivated because
[08:57] they want to feel important I think it's
[08:59] it's a human uh trait that we want to
[09:01] feel important and uh it really uh makes
[09:04] people feel uh they feel excited about
[09:07] their work if they think they're saving
[09:08] human civilization so I think quite a
[09:10] few climate scientists alive right now
[09:12] are motivated by uh this view of
[09:15] themselves that they're saving human
[09:16] civilization what they're doing is so
[09:18] important and uh what they do is so
[09:20] important only if there's a climate
[09:22] crisis if the weather is just kind of
[09:24] fluctuating all over and there's no
[09:26] crisis whatsoever then uh they're not so
[09:28] important anymore I think that's a big
[09:30] factor in all of this it's and then
[09:32] there's so much power and money on the
[09:34] line for governments uh you can tax
[09:37] people in many different ways you can
[09:38] have a cbdc central bank digital
[09:41] currency and you can um if you think
[09:43] there's a climate crisis or if you can
[09:45] sell that idea then you can uh control
[09:48] how much meat everybody gets to eat on
[09:50] an individual level you've had too much
[09:51] meat this month you can't buy anymore
[09:53] you've flown too much this year you
[09:55] can't fly anymore so there's all this
[09:57] control and Taxation and
[09:59] it's amazing that so many things are
[10:01] pushing in the same direction and I
[10:03] think that's why Humanity has gone off
[10:05] the rails here getting so excited so
[10:08] hysterical over nothing and the whole
[10:10] idea that CO2 is a pollutant and there's
[10:12] any sort of a CL crisis it's all nothing
[10:15] it's amazing that we've gone this far
[10:17] off the rails and um truth is going to
[10:20] win out and it is winning out now but
[10:22] it's an amazing time of Hysteria right
[10:24] now yeah it's interesting also the CO2
[10:27] you you said uh the CO2 is uh like the
[10:32] the the whole thing that CO2 is really
[10:34] essential is not true uh and it's
[10:38] interesting because a lot a lot of
[10:39] companies even have those CO2 uh goals
[10:42] like Zer CO2 when they produce the
[10:44] iPhones I think Apple announced
[10:46] something a year ago and and all those
[10:48] big companies that are like really
[10:50] really really big players but they're
[10:52] like yeah like we have to get the CO2
[10:54] level down um what what by the way first
[10:58] like let's go to Basics what is
[11:00] CO2 and and why is it not so crucial
[11:03] well yeah it's carbon dioxide and it's
[11:05] arguably the most important uh most
[11:09] important Compound on Earth because it's
[11:10] the basis of life it's the basis of
[11:13] photosynthesis and we don't have CO2 in
[11:15] the air we all die we have to have it
[11:18] there so the fight against CO2 is like
[11:20] fighting oxygen or it's like fighting
[11:22] water it's just a critical part of our
[11:24] life uh of life on Earth so it's just
[11:27] amazing that uh people think that it's a
[11:30] it's a demon molecule that's causing all
[11:32] this terrible stuff and we have to fight
[11:34] it uh I've talked elsewhere about
[11:36] there's an actual peer reviewed paper
[11:38] that says that one thing we should do to
[11:39] fight CO2 is have two million people
[11:42] working full-time cutting down trees and
[11:45] digging holes and burying the trees in
[11:47] the holes to sequester carbon because as
[11:49] a tree grows it sucks out CO2 from the
[11:52] air and that carbon goes into the trunk
[11:54] and to get rid of CO2 to get rid of
[11:57] carbon rather we should bury it
[11:58] Underground are sequestered underground
[12:00] by cutting down all these trees so it's
[12:02] just an example of just this crazy fight
[12:04] against this important molecule that we
[12:06] need and another thing about CO2 is that
[12:09] there's not very much of it in the air
[12:11] it's only
[12:12] 0.04% of the air right now is CO2 so
[12:16] humans supposedly have added one
[12:19] additional CO2 molecule to the air for
[12:21] every 10,000 molecules of the air so the
[12:24] fact that we're just going crazy and
[12:26] over this one extra molecule for every
[12:28] 10,000 molecules and thinking that that
[12:31] should be the centerpiece of our
[12:33] government is to fight carbon dioxide
[12:35] it's just beyond crazy it's
[12:37] amazing is there any difference when we
[12:40] uh as a humans we like uh use like on a
[12:44] on a very human level we we have like
[12:46] plastic things going on like oh you
[12:48] should not use that plastic the plastic
[12:49] should be recycled nicely uh or we
[12:52] should not drive normal cars we should
[12:54] drive electric cars that like a little
[12:56] bit bigger things uh but then oh yeah th
[12:59] those celebrities should not drive with
[13:01] a private chat like like there are like
[13:03] a lot of different levels on where we
[13:06] like oh like we we have to we have to
[13:09] not do this because of of the the Earth
[13:12] um is it uh even to small extend true
[13:16] that uh we have to um make sure our
[13:19] climate is uh good or our Earth is good
[13:22] can we do anything to actually make our
[13:24] Earth better for humans or Is It Anyways
[13:28] getting is any this good no matter what
[13:30] we are
[13:31] doing yeah I think Dave colum talks
[13:34] about smuggling other arguments into the
[13:36] climate argument so there are some there
[13:38] are real pollutants and humans we affect
[13:41] the climate in some way not maybe we
[13:43] can't measure it but everything on Earth
[13:45] affects the climate in some way but then
[13:48] uh right away people start talking about
[13:50] other pollutants about uh non CO2
[13:52] pollutants that might cause the air to
[13:54] be dirty in a city or something so yeah
[13:56] there are real pollutants and Mercury in
[13:58] our water that's that's a real pollutant
[14:01] and so the whole idea that people like
[14:02] me we think that humans have no effect
[14:04] on the earth and that all pollution is
[14:06] great and let's just pave over
[14:08] everything uh I mean I'm a bird watcher
[14:10] and a deer hunter and I love nature
[14:12] myself but what I'm saying is the whole
[14:15] fight just against carbon dioxide that
[14:17] part of it is crazy but and I think
[14:19] that's taking some of the oxygen or the
[14:21] attention away from fights against Real
[14:23] pollution and against uh real
[14:25] conservation of natural land Etc so I
[14:28] think it's important not to mix all
[14:29] these arguments together and the one
[14:31] that I'm talking about is the fight
[14:33] against CO2 that particular fight is
[14:35] totally crazy that part of it
[14:37] interesting what are the some of the the
[14:40] real pollutants that that actually hurt
[14:42] our environment yeah I don't know as
[14:44] much about those definitely U like
[14:46] Mercury is one of those but there are
[14:48] other things I'm not sure what to think
[14:50] about the various pesticides or even
[14:53] about the
[14:54] DDT um I don't think it's as dangerous
[14:57] as advertise times but yeah there's a a
[15:00] lot of pesticides my dad is a farmer
[15:02] still and he tries to reduce the use of
[15:05] pesticides I don't like the idea even in
[15:07] my neighborhood here of just spraying
[15:10] with a helicopter or dropping pellets to
[15:13] uh try to get rid of mosquitoes and
[15:15] stuff I don't think we fully have uh
[15:17] researched all these chemicals to make
[15:19] sure they're long-term safe I don't know
[15:21] the answers but generally uh these
[15:23] unnatural pesticides Etc I think we need
[15:25] to be very careful with them to make
[15:26] sure that we're not causing more harm
[15:28] than good with them another thing that I
[15:31] was wondering about and I think you also
[15:33] wrote it in those uh five six points
[15:35] that you uh that you sent to me um it
[15:38] seems like whenever you uh discuss that
[15:41] or you see a political debate around
[15:43] that it's like oh yeah all experts uh
[15:46] agree like yes uh we have to fight
[15:49] climate crisis and then the other side
[15:50] is like yeah yeah but no the other
[15:52] experts also um do most of the experts
[15:56] agree on that or like how's that look
[15:59] that's a great question because the
[16:01] narrative is that 97% of scientists on
[16:04] Earth believe that there's a climate
[16:06] crisis caused by carbon dioxide that's
[16:08] kind of the narrative but the reality I
[16:11] think is quite different I don't know
[16:12] what the answer is but I think that most
[16:15] scientists on Earth believe that CO2 is
[16:17] a greenhouse gas and everything else
[16:19] being equal that adding more CO2 will
[16:22] make the Earth slightly warmer in some
[16:24] sense I think there's some consensus on
[16:26] that but even there's quite a few people
[16:27] that don't even go go that far but the
[16:30] whole idea that right now it's too hot
[16:32] and we're experiencing a climate crisis
[16:34] right now um I think almost no scientist
[16:37] in the world is living as if he or she
[16:39] actually believes that if you look at
[16:41] their Lifestyles they're just living
[16:42] like the rest of us they're flying and
[16:44] driving their internal combustion car
[16:46] and all that stuff so I think this whole
[16:48] thing I call it a a cult this whole
[16:51] climate cult it's an odd cult that even
[16:54] the Believers can't be bothered to
[16:56] behave as if they actually believe in it
[16:58] it's very
[16:59] almost nobody actually behaves as if
[17:01] they really think that CO2 might kill
[17:03] our children because it's crazy and it's
[17:05] not going to harm our children at all I
[17:07] think one popular example of that is
[17:09] always Bill Gates where he buys land
[17:13] directly in front of seas and then he
[17:15] like argues also that like sea levels
[17:17] are rising and stuff like that um are
[17:19] sea levels Rising is there any anything
[17:23] anything to that yes sea levels are
[17:26] rising uh I just looked it up and I
[17:28] think either Noah anasa says that they
[17:30] think Seas have risen eight or n Ines
[17:32] since 1880 so it's not as it's not as
[17:35] easy as you might think to get that
[17:37] number because it's hard to figure out
[17:38] what's going on there's Tides happening
[17:40] there the land is moving up and down and
[17:43] uh it's hard to tell exactly how much
[17:45] Global Seas have risen in that time but
[17:48] I do think that's probably right that
[17:50] the Seas have risen maybe eight or nine
[17:51] inches since 1880 but um most people
[17:55] also agree that seas in the last 200
[17:57] centuries have risen about 400 ft so
[18:01] it's varied a lot how much it's risen
[18:03] per Century but that would be an average
[18:05] of 2 feet per century and U so Seas do
[18:08] rise we are in in an interglacial and uh
[18:11] 20,000 years ago it it was way colder
[18:14] and that ice a lot of it has melted over
[18:16] the last 20,000 years and seas have
[18:18] risen like I say maybe 400 feet so I
[18:22] kind of it's kind of weird that we're
[18:23] supposed to think we had about 400t of
[18:25] natural sea level rise and then we
[18:27] should panic over this last eight or n
[18:28] in and we think we caused it and we
[18:31] should Panic about it so that sea level
[18:33] rise since 1880 it's nothing to panic
[18:36] about and uh we don't know how much of
[18:38] it humans caused uh but certainly wasn't
[18:40] all of it so I'm not worried about sea
[18:43] level rise at all and in some places on
[18:45] Earth the uh the land is change the land
[18:49] moving up and down is much more
[18:51] important than the global sea level
[18:53] changing with land moving up and down
[18:56] just because yeah yeah I think in Juno I
[18:59] need to look it up but Juno Alaska might
[19:01] be an example of one place where the
[19:03] land is is moving up faster than the sea
[19:06] is rising so there's a relative change
[19:08] there that's not what you might expect
[19:11] interesting inter so so you saying it's
[19:13] it's uh like definitely no danger right
[19:16] now but can it ever be a danger if
[19:20] there's too much water on Earth then the
[19:22] whole earth is on water yeah I I I think
[19:26] we're just going to have to adapt
[19:27] whatever happens we're going to have
[19:28] have to adapt to it and humans I mean
[19:30] we've been around we've seen a lot of
[19:31] this change humans of course were around
[19:33] for this whole 400 feet in the last
[19:35] 20,000 years humans were around for that
[19:38] and of course the land bridge between
[19:40] the between America and Russia that
[19:43] appeared and disappeared and it's
[19:45] interesting that I'm reading that Roman
[19:47] ports that were in use in the Roman
[19:49] times some of them might be a mile or
[19:50] two Inland right now they're just way in
[19:53] land there's no access to the Sea there
[19:56] so yeah the seas are going to change
[19:58] definitely by uh us eating cheeseburgers
[20:00] or not or riding our bikes or not we're
[20:02] supposed to think that that is going to
[20:04] like stabilize the sea levels that's not
[20:07] how it works at all we're just gonna
[20:09] have to
[20:10] adapt sometimes I feel like it's could
[20:12] even be uh correlated to Money Getting
[20:16] devalued because if you uh convince
[20:19] everyone that they have to ride a bike
[20:21] instead of a car then their cost of
[20:23] living is going down and then they don't
[20:26] uh see inflation that heavily on their
[20:29] again even that thought was in my head
[20:31] I've heard safe make that argument about
[20:33] uh inflation and about food I think that
[20:36] they want to get us to eat the bugs
[20:37] instead of eating steaks of partially
[20:40] because of the value of our money going
[20:42] down so yeah I do think that the uh the
[20:46] whole money printing thing is affecting
[20:47] everything including the forever Wars
[20:49] and the forever war against carbon
[20:51] dioxide it's uh it's important to think
[20:53] about that yeah I had the offer of uh
[20:57] feat food
[20:59] Matias luzak on on my show and he
[21:02] basically wrote a book about fat food
[21:04] with cerine uh and this was really
[21:07] interesting where we also got into like
[21:09] food supplies and what changed in the
[21:10] last hundred years uh and how they try
[21:14] to get like cheaper and cheaper food
[21:16] because people are really upset if if
[21:18] their groceries are going up in price uh
[21:22] so what is the uh thing if like the
[21:25] money is getting devalued you kind of
[21:27] have to adopt some and the food supply
[21:29] is kind of changed and he really gets in
[21:31] a lot of arguments in in like how School
[21:35] uh foods have changed in the last 50 to
[21:37] 100 years and all those things but yeah
[21:39] has nothing to do with climate but I
[21:41] think there's an interesting comparison
[21:42] to be made that like even um those
[21:45] arguments are maybe even used in in the
[21:47] climate debate for lowering the cost of
[21:50] living it's it's interesting to think
[21:51] about yeah I think you made me think
[21:54] about there's something called shrink
[21:56] flation right where uh they like remove
[21:59] one or two Dorito chips from the bag of
[22:01] Dorito chips so the cost may stay
[22:04] similar but there's just a little bit
[22:05] less product in there I think there
[22:07] might be quite a bit of that um then the
[22:09] other thing is I just it makes me laugh
[22:12] kind of this whole idea that we need to
[22:13] have crickets in our bread that's going
[22:16] to prevent bad weather in 2050 if we eat
[22:18] bread with crickets in it that's an
[22:19] actual argument that we're hearing and
[22:23] it's not the only ridiculous one it's
[22:24] just like there's hundreds of these
[22:25] completely crazy arguments it's uh it's
[22:28] funny yeah
[22:30] true I definitely want know one good
[22:33] friend of mine unfortunately that I have
[22:35] to send this episode to I'm really
[22:38] looking forward to that um uh I I talk
[22:41] talked to you about that before we kind
[22:44] we have already right now in Austria a
[22:47] small flood going on it's not a big one
[22:49] it's not like uh houses are washed away
[22:53] or something like that it's just like
[22:54] yeah we we experience a lot of rain and
[22:56] yes uh the the small River that usually
[22:59] have almost no water in them have not a
[23:01] lot of water in them and some uban
[23:04] station and some sellers are overflooded
[23:07] but nothing really crazy nothing that
[23:10] anyone would notice in like two three
[23:12] weeks or we would talk about that um but
[23:16] what I've noticed that all political
[23:18] parties shifted into like oh yeah that
[23:21] that's because of that and there's like
[23:23] the others like oh that's not because of
[23:24] that so like especially the green part
[23:26] is like oh yeah we have to fight against
[23:28] climate we have to ride with the bike do
[23:30] the work uh because we experience like a
[23:33] massive flood um what's your thoughts
[23:35] around that uh situation that I just
[23:38] described yeah so there is this overall
[23:41] there's this idea that bad weather you
[23:43] can just point at bad weather and say ah
[23:44] this proves that CO2 causes bad weather
[23:47] but that that's never true none of this
[23:49] you can point at any fire or flood or
[23:51] drought and oh look how bad it is
[23:53] they're constantly saying it's they're
[23:54] trying to tell us it's unprecedented and
[23:56] uh we haven't seen a flood like this for
[23:58] for 10 years or 50 years or whatever but
[24:01] but anyway it's very important to
[24:02] realize just how bad the floods and
[24:04] droughts and everything were in the past
[24:06] even in human history uh Tony heler is a
[24:09] guy he's at Tony climate on X he just
[24:12] does a great job of digging into the
[24:14] past and just showing we have all these
[24:16] records of just horrible things that
[24:17] have happened uh that have been recorded
[24:20] in human history the whole idea that
[24:22] whatever just happened is uh it's really
[24:24] bad must have been caused by CO2 total
[24:26] nonstarter and one thing I like about
[24:28] the floods is that there are these
[24:30] churches in Europe a church for example
[24:33] I've seen several pictures of those
[24:34] where it shows here's where the flood
[24:35] got to be in 1540 and here's where the
[24:37] flood was in 1720 or whatever I don't
[24:40] know if you've seen those pictures where
[24:41] they actually have the high water mark
[24:44] on the church and I think that's just a
[24:45] great counter to whatever flood just
[24:47] happened now that's like 10 feet lower
[24:50] than was the one in 1540 that we're
[24:52] supposed to panic about the current
[24:54] flood so there's another flood I wanted
[24:56] to mention here in California that
[24:58] people don't know about maybe around
[25:01] 1862 during the US Civil War there was
[25:03] just an absolutely mindblowing like
[25:05] close to maybe 40 days and nights of
[25:08] rain in California and uh one quarter of
[25:11] the cattle drowned in California and
[25:13] there was an inland Lake that was I
[25:15] forget maybe 300 miles long and uh tens
[25:18] of miles wide just a mindblowing flood
[25:21] that happened way back then way before
[25:23] we were burning much coal or whatever
[25:25] and 100% if a flood like that happened
[25:28] that there would be so much publicity
[25:30] that we have to change our ways because
[25:32] CO2 look at this it was such a bad flood
[25:34] that CO2 the humans must have caused it
[25:37] uh but my point here is that if you look
[25:39] back uh there's just horrendous things
[25:42] that have happened whatever happened now
[25:43] has probably not anywhere near as bad as
[25:45] what happened in the past and once in a
[25:47] while we're going to get a really bad
[25:48] event that maybe it is a 500 year event
[25:51] now but still that doesn't prove that
[25:53] CO2 caused it CO2 is not causing any of
[25:55] this stuff even the ipcc says that by
[25:57] the way if you carefully read what they
[25:59] say like about floods they say that we
[26:02] don't even know the sign of the global
[26:05] change in floods and they say similar
[26:07] stuff about droughts and Cyclones and in
[26:09] fact in Cyclones it looks like globally
[26:12] they might be just going down a little
[26:13] bit they're going to fluctuate but the
[26:15] whole idea that any current storms uh
[26:18] are worse now and we should Panic about
[26:19] that totally not true also in US
[26:22] hurricanes there's a guy named Joe bardi
[26:24] that talks about us hurricanes for
[26:26] whatever reason in the 1950s the major
[26:28] hurricanes that hit the US it was just a
[26:30] really bad decade and we don't really
[26:32] know why they fluctuate some decades
[26:34] there's not many and the 1950s were
[26:36] really bad but again this whole idea
[26:38] that if we put more CO2 in the air we
[26:40] get more hurricanes floods droughts not
[26:43] true we're constantly told that CO2
[26:45] makes wet places wetter and dry places
[26:47] drier but that's not happening either
[26:50] the Sahara looks like it's getting
[26:51] wetter for some reason recently we don't
[26:53] know
[26:55] why for me it's that um
[26:58] the difference between normal weather
[27:01] and climate is is kind of like the the
[27:05] thing that I always get to when people
[27:06] are like oh it's raining it's because of
[27:08] that and stuff like that um it's still
[27:11] like from from a science perspective
[27:13] what is the difference between like
[27:15] weather and and climate from those
[27:17] things because it seem like the they
[27:18] kind of getting mixed up some days yeah
[27:21] I mean one definition I see is that
[27:23] climate is a 30 years 30-year average of
[27:26] weather you hear that some places that's
[27:28] a 30-year thing so like for an
[27:30] individual storm to be I would say for
[27:33] it to be a climate event one storm that
[27:35] storm has to last for 30 years otherwise
[27:37] any other storm is it's just a weather
[27:39] event that's the thing though we're
[27:41] seeing in the media that they're
[27:42] constantly referring to a storm as a
[27:44] climate event but that's because they're
[27:47] trying to sell this narrative I think or
[27:49] this is in their head that uh things
[27:51] that happen that the last for two days
[27:53] they they're calling them climate events
[27:54] but those are weather events and I think
[27:56] they should get back to calling them
[27:57] appropriate weather because that's what
[27:59] it is interesting yeah yeah um and for
[28:03] people that want to really get started
[28:04] with that rabbit hole I think you even
[28:07] made a movie or you produced a movie um
[28:10] it's called climate the movie uh movie
[28:13] about climate climate the movie it makes
[28:15] makes a lot of sense the name um why did
[28:17] you make that what is your goal with it
[28:19] and is that a good starter for for
[28:21] entering the climate Rabbit Hole yeah
[28:24] I'm glad glad you brought that up I was
[28:25] the producer of climate the movie and
[28:27] it's a followup to Martin durkin's 2007
[28:30] movie The Great global warming Swindle
[28:32] that went on TV in Britain in 2007 and
[28:35] it got a huge blowback because people's
[28:38] minds were kind of blown that this uh
[28:40] thing on TV was pushing back against
[28:42] this narrative so the media went after
[28:44] him he got a lot of kind of personal
[28:46] attacks and then he was on my podcast uh
[28:49] in October of 22 I think it was he said
[28:52] you know given more time and what I know
[28:53] now it would be nice to remake that
[28:55] movie and that kicked off a process
[28:57] where I worked with him it took about a
[28:59] year total and I give Martin all the
[29:01] credit in the world for making this
[29:02] movie he uh did the interviews and he
[29:04] wrote the script and he did the
[29:05] narration he did all he did a lot of the
[29:07] editing his team and him did a great job
[29:10] and I think this movie is does a very
[29:13] good job of just tearing apart this
[29:15] whole narrative that we've just been
[29:16] talking about that the weather's getting
[29:17] worse Etc it's 80 minutes long and about
[29:20] the first two-thirds is about the
[29:21] science we have a lot of scientists uh
[29:23] prominent scientists in there including
[29:25] a Nobel Prize winner 2022 physics
[29:28] Nobelist John clauser calls this whole
[29:31] thing a Croc and we have will haer
[29:33] calling it a a scam or a hoax and we
[29:36] have Richard Linden also a decorated
[29:38] scientist he's calling it a cult so the
[29:42] movie has uh done very well um it's
[29:45] available for free kind of everywhere
[29:47] it's a lot of copies are on YouTube and
[29:49] Rumble and bitshoot and substack and
[29:51] telegram a lot of copies are on X and it
[29:54] has uh way over 10 million views it's
[29:56] hard to keep track because there's
[29:58] probably over 100 copies of it up right
[30:00] now and a lot the clips of it are up and
[30:03] so what makes me happy is a lot of
[30:04] people online have downloaded either the
[30:06] whole movie or clips and then they've
[30:08] put that that up separately on their own
[30:10] social media so it's kind of viral it's
[30:12] kind of gone everywhere and Facebook and
[30:14] Instagram have given people strikes for
[30:17] sharing a link to it because it's
[30:19] supposed to be disinformation or
[30:20] misinformation but that's a total Croc
[30:22] too because the it's it's just
[30:24] information it's not misinformation but
[30:26] again it's pushing back against the
[30:28] narrative and uh somebody behind
[30:30] Facebook doesn't like push back against
[30:32] this whole climate scam
[30:34] narrative interesting what is the what
[30:37] is the main takeaway from from the book
[30:38] was it kind of what we already discussed
[30:40] in the first 30 minutes yeah yeah it's
[30:42] mostly that that uh the whole it's the
[30:46] whole thing is hysteria and it goes back
[30:48] and it points out that the weather was
[30:50] bad in the past and warm times were good
[30:51] and just a lot of the stuff that we've
[30:53] talked about already here it just makes
[30:55] the point that uh we should not be
[30:56] fighting CO2 and uh why are we really
[30:59] doing this maybe there's other motives
[31:01] for doing this it's an attack it's
[31:03] mostly an attack actually on working
[31:06] people and and Free People yeah I I
[31:08] think people like uh workingclass people
[31:10] are figuring out that uh people who are
[31:12] trying to fight uh push this climate
[31:15] scam narrative they don't have the
[31:17] interests of the working people in mind
[31:19] it it's not helping out the people who
[31:21] have real jobs it's just sucking their
[31:24] money and power and for no real reason
[31:26] if you watch my podcast ready for more
[31:28] than two times you know how extremely
[31:31] passionate I am about self- custody and
[31:34] the first very very very important step
[31:36] to self custody is always getting
[31:40] yourself a hardware wallet and I have
[31:43] one for you here this is the Bitcoin
[31:45] only Edition from the bitbox my favorite
[31:48] single signature Hardware wallet on the
[31:51] market another really important piece of
[31:54] self custody if you have a hardware
[31:56] wallet is the backup up of the seat
[31:58] phrase and bitbox made the perfect
[32:00] solution to back up your seed phrase
[32:03] they made a reusable steel wallet check
[32:07] out that beauty it's durable and
[32:09] extremely heavy if I put it on the desk
[32:12] I seriously fear for my own table it's
[32:15] so so heavy and durable I love it this
[32:18] is where my seed phrase is secure go to
[32:22] bitbox
[32:23] do/ robobin to get your bitbox and if
[32:27] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[32:32] of your complete order and the next step
[32:34] is to really level up your sovereignty
[32:37] as an individual you have to have the
[32:39] most secure self- custody setup you have
[32:42] to secure your own devices you have to
[32:45] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:48] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:50] where you live you even want to have a
[32:53] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:56] in case something goes really really
[32:57] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:59] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:02] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:05] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:09] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[33:12] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:14] and last but not least I have something
[33:17] completely new for you guys I partnered
[33:20] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[33:23] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:26] saw created by anyone look at that
[33:29] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[33:32] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[33:35] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[33:38] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[33:40] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[33:44] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[33:47] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:50] watch collections you have the date of
[33:53] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:56] there and of course also the block
[33:58] height and which Epoch we are currently
[34:01] in I love the level of detail they put
[34:04] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:07] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:10] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:13] love those watches so so much as you
[34:16] mentioned Facebook uh what what role
[34:18] does uh Big T with Google Facebook Apple
[34:23] uh play play into that what what role
[34:25] are they just reacting to the to the big
[34:27] bigger narrative or do they have some
[34:29] role playing in that yeah it's a great
[34:32] question I mean we saw this so many
[34:34] people are now seeing what happened with
[34:36] the censorship in the whole covid thing
[34:38] there was all that censorship and
[34:40] working with the US government working
[34:42] directly with the US government to do
[34:44] this censorship so one guy who does a
[34:46] great job of talking about the whole
[34:48] censorship problem is Mike Benz bnz I
[34:51] love listening to his content about this
[34:53] but that's a huge problem and not of
[34:55] course just with climate censorship but
[34:58] uh all sorts of narratives that are
[34:59] being pushed on us the truth is being
[35:01] censored by big Tech maybe working with
[35:04] governments and maybe working with the
[35:05] UN there's a famous uh Melissa Fleming
[35:09] from the UN is talking about uh they're
[35:11] saying we own the science and she's
[35:13] proudly saying we're working with Google
[35:14] to suppress the climate skeptic
[35:17] narrative on Google she's just saying
[35:19] the quiet part out loud so it's pretty
[35:21] amazing that they're admitting that
[35:22] they're they're censoring us and they
[35:24] have to censor us because uh in a free
[35:26] market of ideas they lose every time we
[35:29] have a full public we have a real public
[35:31] debate on this the alarmists lose
[35:33] because there's nothing that that backs
[35:35] this up they they there's been
[35:37] high-profile debates where they've lost
[35:38] and now they they're not interested in
[35:40] doing debates anymore uh publicly uh
[35:42] because and I think that's an important
[35:44] point for people to realize if you're
[35:45] coming from outside the debate I think
[35:47] the side that avoids debates uh is
[35:49] probably not the side that's right I
[35:51] think that's a general Point like the
[35:53] the the side that doesn't want to debate
[35:55] too much and and want to send is the
[35:57] other side is probably hiding something
[35:59] otherwise they would not be fearful of a
[36:02] debate that's a that's a great General
[36:04] point I think and I guess oh in human
[36:06] history people have said when in human
[36:08] history have the people doing the
[36:09] censoring been the good guys I don't
[36:11] know when that's ever been the
[36:13] case yeah true like sensoring is a
[36:16] historical thing that is has always been
[36:18] there in in some sort like of course
[36:20] like now it's it's different with social
[36:22] media and it's I think it's getting
[36:24] harder and harder to censor that the
[36:25] more we get Advanced with technology
[36:28] uh because even though you might get
[36:30] censored on Facebook there's Rumble uh
[36:33] there's Nostra even now that is
[36:35] completely sensor free at least as I
[36:38] know uh but there are not a lot of
[36:40] people on there till now so like it it's
[36:42] getting hard and harder with the
[36:44] technology technology advancements and
[36:47] also with with Bitcoin and and maybe can
[36:49] get into uh what's your take a little
[36:51] bit on that also um now people also have
[36:55] are not dependent on a on a a bank
[36:57] system they can just like take their own
[36:59] money in their own hands so I think we
[37:01] have a lot of uh good factors into play
[37:04] that the truth comes out and and as you
[37:06] said like the uh that are there they
[37:09] will always be there and it's just a
[37:11] matter of time till uh Society notice
[37:14] the
[37:15] stem yeah one other platform we didn't
[37:17] mention is just X that Elon Musk gets a
[37:20] lot of criticism still and he there I
[37:22] think he had a quote about uh something
[37:24] about freedom of speech but not freedom
[37:26] of reach and there are still complaints
[37:28] that some things are getting throttled
[37:29] on X but overall I would say I'm a big
[37:33] fan of the changes that happened when he
[37:35] took over I was definitely throttled and
[37:37] banned and stuff way more often back
[37:40] before he got X than than now so for me
[37:44] X is the best place to get your message
[37:46] out in terms of a big audience and not
[37:49] too much Shadow Banning I think
[37:52] absolutely and the axis I always ask my
[37:54] guests in the end of the show where they
[37:57] uh where people can find them and ask
[37:59] them questions and 95 or 96% I did not
[38:03] make an exact status just in my head now
[38:06] but almost everyone says like Yeah x you
[38:08] can find me an X some refer to website
[38:11] some refer to YouTube but like 95 96%
[38:14] people say like yeah find me on XEL like
[38:16] it's it's it's a great platform because
[38:19] it mixes yes there's the mainstream
[38:22] media on there people actually watch it
[38:24] and even mainstream media quotes from so
[38:27] like it's really a portal to the
[38:29] mainstream media but it's not censored
[38:32] as the other platform so I think it's a
[38:34] it's a great mix between Nostra and
[38:37] Facebook like that's how I see so one
[38:40] other platform that I might be using
[38:42] more is substack I just I started I just
[38:45] posted one thing on substack I've been
[38:47] putting out just like podcast summaries
[38:50] and stuff out there but not really doing
[38:52] much posting but I just put one post out
[38:54] there and I I'm kind of used to the
[38:56] YouTube comment section where you
[38:58] probably can't post a link and if you
[38:59] post the wrong thing they'll delete it
[39:01] and but on substack it looks like you
[39:03] can post a link and you can post actual
[39:05] stuff and no one's gonna take it down so
[39:08] that really attracts me and maybe
[39:10] substack is gonna grow get more and more
[39:13] users because of that I think the Free
[39:15] Speech right now on substack is really
[39:17] nice can you not uh also host your own
[39:21] substack uh like I'm not 100% sure about
[39:25] that but I think you can host your own
[39:26] substack on your own address but on your
[39:29] own Ur on your own domain but I'm not
[39:32] 100% sure about that I think that's true
[39:33] I haven't done that but I I think that
[39:35] is true and then then it's like your
[39:38] domain of course the domain
[39:40] provider can censor you but then you
[39:42] really have to do something that pisses
[39:45] someone off I don't know you have to be
[39:47] in the big leagues for that um yeah um
[39:50] before we come to the to the the end and
[39:53] come closer to the end uh I want to ask
[39:55] you about Bitcoin also what what's your
[39:58] general take on bitcoin and what do you
[40:00] think is the role of Bitcoin in our
[40:03] world so yeah I would say I'm pretty
[40:05] much orange pilled at this point and so
[40:08] I didn't think about Bitcoin uh much at
[40:11] all until I was on Marty Ben's podcasts
[40:14] a couple years ago maybe and and safe's
[40:16] podcast and it just got me thinking
[40:18] about it and I started to dig in and I
[40:20] uh listened to the Bitcoin standard and
[40:22] I've listened to a lot of Bitcoin
[40:24] podcasts I've listened to quite a few of
[40:26] your podcasts which which by the way
[40:28] totally loving them and um yeah I think
[40:31] I think it's real and uh I have high
[40:33] hopes for this whole idea that maybe it
[40:36] can continue to compete against the
[40:38] central banks I'm more and more learning
[40:40] about the whole Central Bank thing and
[40:41] and how this whole printing of money is
[40:44] just such an evil thing for Humanity so
[40:47] this whole idea of free money that uh
[40:49] you governments can't use for forever
[40:51] Wars again it makes me really happy I
[40:54] have I have high hopes for it and I'm a
[40:56] fan and I I'm orange pilled I'm going to
[40:58] go to uh Bitcoin uh Amsterdam coming up
[41:01] and uh super excited about that Bitcoin
[41:03] Nashville was very fun really cool I'm
[41:06] also in Amsterdam by the way for
[41:07] everyone that's listening with code
[41:09] Robin you get some percentage off you
[41:12] want to miss it us there um but yeah um
[41:15] really cool uh one question um this this
[41:19] was my first question uh in in this
[41:20] podcast where I asked you about the
[41:22] impact of the humans and uh about uh our
[41:27] AR system on the climate uh which has no
[41:32] zero to no impact but what impact do you
[41:35] think has central banks and cheap money
[41:37] on those narratives around climate
[41:40] crisis do you think that uh on a sound
[41:42] money standard we might have uh better
[41:45] narratives around the around the climate
[41:48] that is a great question I haven't
[41:50] thought about that much about how these
[41:52] narratives have been financed but it
[41:53] kind of seems like it's all it's a
[41:55] monolithic thing up above with the UN
[41:57] and the wef ETC pushing a number of
[42:01] crazy narratives on us uh and uh I do
[42:04] think that in a Bitcoin world that maybe
[42:07] they'll have less power I don't I can't
[42:09] really picture in my head what happens
[42:10] to them 20 30 years from now uh when the
[42:14] we got hyperbitcoinization I don't know
[42:17] but it seems like uh seems like it might
[42:20] be a more honest world and uh less
[42:23] funding for just crazy stuff we have so
[42:25] much funding or so much money printed
[42:27] funding of crazy stuff on and on that U
[42:31] I think if we can cut that out U the
[42:33] world's going to be a much better place
[42:35] I'm interested if it gets rolled out in
[42:36] just certain countries maybe El Salvador
[42:39] I'm really interested to see what
[42:40] happens there if they can be a model and
[42:42] uh if there's a lot of success there
[42:44] that other countries or other uh other
[42:47] areas on worth on Earth might follow
[42:49] along behind El Salvador maybe I don't
[42:51] know uh yeah if you I don't know if you
[42:54] have been to El Salvador but if you want
[42:56] to visit uh there in November actually
[42:58] the adopting Bitcoin conference I will
[43:00] also be there oh I would love to go I
[43:03] don't think I can make it i' would love
[43:04] to go and see what it's like there you
[43:06] haven't been yet right I haven't been
[43:09] there no like that's why I really want
[43:11] to go there uh and I was like let's
[43:13] let's do it this year because I have
[43:16] this podcast now for almost a year like
[43:18] nine 10 months or something like that uh
[43:20] and so many people from El Salvador and
[43:23] people that moved to El Salvador said
[43:24] like oh you at least have to visit I
[43:27] yeah okay okay but it's it's far like
[43:29] it's a 16-hour flight and it's it's like
[43:31] I have to go there and then yeah let's
[43:33] let's do it on the conference so I will
[43:35] be there for the conference uh in in
[43:37] November for like a week uh I will be
[43:39] meeting people there and and seeing
[43:41] what's what's it all about I also like
[43:43] did not um have followed any
[43:46] recommendations of the uh of the Bitcoin
[43:50] conference there I just was like oh I
[43:51] will be just a normal tour it will be
[43:54] just like some Airbnb where I meet
[43:55] someone actually outside of the Bitcoin
[43:57] bubble in El
[43:59] Salvador I really want to get uh
[44:02] speaking with people there that are not
[44:04] in Bitcoin because the bitcoiners
[44:06] obviously will uh praise El Salvador I
[44:09] really want to get also some some maybe
[44:12] negative uh voices from salador maybe
[44:15] against nuk on there because it's it's
[44:17] interesting for me um how positive it
[44:20] has been and I'm always really cautious
[44:22] if it's too positive in some Direction
[44:25] but maybe uh maybe it's just really good
[44:27] in salador let's see super interesting
[44:30] you you've had a really interesting last
[44:32] 10 nine 10 months huh yourself yeah so
[44:35] interesting yeah yeah absolutely um one
[44:39] question U before I end the before we
[44:40] come to the end routine is there
[44:42] anything to The Climate discussion that
[44:45] I have missed anything that I should
[44:47] have asked but I didn't ask actually one
[44:50] question that comes up is uh that why is
[44:53] it warming so fast recently I I I hear
[44:56] that quite often that humans must be
[44:58] causing climate change because it's so
[45:00] fast way faster than it ever did but
[45:02] anyway that narrative like everything
[45:05] else that's alarming about the narrative
[45:07] is just the complete Croc because it's
[45:08] not warming that fast since the uh we
[45:11] had a little kind of a global cooling
[45:13] scare in the 1970s so I think Earth has
[45:15] maybe warmed by 0.18 C maybe per decade
[45:20] since then um and you know it it warms
[45:23] for decades and cools for decades I
[45:25] don't think that we're NE necessarily
[45:27] going to see that we can't project that
[45:28] rate into the future Forever Until the
[45:30] Earth boils or anything but anyway the
[45:32] whole idea that we know that Earth
[45:35] climate is supposed to be stable and uh
[45:37] there's this whole hockey stick thing I
[45:38] don't know if you've heard much about
[45:39] the hockey stick where the Earth's
[45:41] temperature is supposed to be like the
[45:43] handle of a hockey stick for maybe
[45:45] thousands of years Earth's temperature
[45:47] was pegged flat and then as soon as the
[45:49] Industrial Revolution happened then it's
[45:51] like the blade of the hockey stick where
[45:53] suddenly as soon as we started burning
[45:55] coal that Earth temperature shot up so
[45:57] anyway both parts of that hockey stick
[45:59] are just a complete Croc the whole
[46:01] handle of the hockey stick the
[46:03] temperatures were supposed to stay
[46:04] stable for thousands of years that's not
[46:06] how it works the earth's climate just uh
[46:09] on decadal scales for sure it goes up
[46:11] and down so the whole straight pegged
[46:13] handle of the hockey stick that's not a
[46:15] thing the whole idea that it shot up
[46:17] when we started uh burning fossil fuels
[46:19] that's absolutely not a thing I just saw
[46:21] in a graph kind of a climate scam
[46:24] propaganda graph that showed the Earth's
[46:26] temperature kind of kind of falling
[46:27] between 1850 and 1910 so the whole idea
[46:31] anyway that look uh it must be us
[46:33] because temperatures shot up when we
[46:34] started burning coal they absolutely did
[46:36] not start shooting up so bottom line is
[46:40] Earth is not warming super fast and uh
[46:43] we shouldn't expect the Earth's
[46:44] temperature to just remain pegged and if
[46:46] it changes then it's our fault that's
[46:48] kind of the narrative it changed that
[46:50] must be our fault we should expect it to
[46:52] be stable that's not the way it works at
[46:55] all I I feel like humans cannot handle
[46:58] that they're not in
[47:00] control it's fascinating to see that
[47:02] like oh we we we have to control it and
[47:04] obviously uh we can control a lot but uh
[47:08] not the climate it's so interesting I
[47:11] hear this argument a lot that we have to
[47:13] stabilize sea levels because we built
[47:14] all this civilization based on the idea
[47:16] that the sea level is going to stay in
[47:18] the same spot so we got to do whatever
[47:20] we can to make it stay in the same spot
[47:22] anyway like I said earlier humans have
[47:24] we've been around a long time and we've
[47:25] seen enormous changes in the seas and if
[47:28] we're around another 2,000 years we're
[47:30] probably going to see more changes in
[47:32] the Seas we don't know but we're not
[47:33] going to be able to stabilize it the
[47:35] climate or the CO2 level we can't
[47:37] basically globally we can't stabilize
[47:39] any of this stuff we're going to have to
[47:41] just roll with the punches as they come
[47:44] it sounds like that uh underlying all
[47:46] those narratives is just fear of the
[47:48] human beings of their own good like
[47:50] they're like oh like sea levels are
[47:52] rising all those things like it's just
[47:53] in a fear uh that they have of like like
[47:57] maybe something really bad happens to to
[48:00] humans yeah I think there's a lot of
[48:02] things going on psychologically here I
[48:04] think a lot of people uh their lives are
[48:06] so easy and uh all of their needs are
[48:09] taken care of and they're kind of almost
[48:10] looking for a problem and I think
[48:12] there's people that are living they got
[48:14] all they want to eat and whatever food
[48:16] clothing shelter it's all taken care of
[48:18] but oh no I've got this huge problem
[48:20] because I'm living through a climate
[48:21] crisis and like now I've got the problem
[48:23] that I need I think I don't know what
[48:25] percent of the people that applies to
[48:27] but some of them for sure I have seen
[48:30] that a lot in in Frank groups where
[48:34] the like for example I'm so busy making
[48:37] my podcast I don't even have the time to
[48:41] uh be like oh like the climate like I
[48:43] don't even have the time to to to to to
[48:45] fear the climate that's why I like to
[48:48] speak with people that know more about
[48:49] it because maybe I have to feel about it
[48:52] but it seems like with everyone uh that
[48:55] that has the with the the facts that
[48:58] they all tell me oh I don't have to fear
[49:00] about that at all like you uh but if if
[49:03] you have a mission and if you're a
[49:05] driven person uh you're not so not not
[49:09] so susceptible to those narratives
[49:12] because you like you have a mission and
[49:14] you you really want to go somewhere and
[49:16] you're not like oh this I have to create
[49:19] a new problem here a new problem here so
[49:22] I think that is a big part of it
[49:24] actually like humans are trying to to
[49:25] figure out a new problem for themselves
[49:27] to keep them
[49:29] busy yeah I should point out that I hate
[49:31] to admit it but there was a time when I
[49:33] believed in this narrative that I kind
[49:34] of believed in whatever the TV told me
[49:37] it was a long time ago but I believed
[49:39] what the TV told me because I thought
[49:40] the experts have proven it it's been
[49:42] fact checked and but I think recently in
[49:45] the last like even last three years I
[49:47] think enormous amounts of people have
[49:48] figured out that the media is lying to
[49:50] us all the time about everything or
[49:52] almost everything I have had tons of
[49:55] people come up to me and say that I
[49:57] believed in this climate thing until the
[49:59] co thing and I figured out oh no they're
[50:01] lying so now I can't just trust the
[50:03] media or I can't just trust the alleged
[50:05] experts and that's when I looked into
[50:07] climate and that's all you have to do in
[50:09] this climate thing if you're interested
[50:11] you can look at the data for yourself on
[50:13] anything about you can look at the polar
[50:14] bear populations or like crop yields
[50:17] we're supposed to believe that CO2 is
[50:18] causing worse crop yields it's super
[50:20] easy for you to just look at our world
[50:22] in data and see that crop yields are
[50:23] going up and that the whole idea that
[50:25] CO2 is making crops fail it's totally
[50:28] ridiculous so I I do think that trust
[50:31] and experts have has failed and um I've
[50:35] heard elsewhere that the elites went for
[50:37] the great reset and what they got was a
[50:39] Great Awakening and I think that is
[50:41] really happening I'm loving it totally
[50:43] loving it that's very true um what made
[50:46] you wake up like what you said like you
[50:48] believe those narratives were was there
[50:49] a trigger event we like oh now I get it
[50:52] now I have to ask more questions I'm
[50:54] Emar embarrassed even then because my
[50:56] Awakening was was was slow I wakeen to
[50:58] the climate thing back around 2006 or so
[51:01] I have this whole backstory about this
[51:02] ivory build woodpecker rediscovery that
[51:04] was announced around 2005 and as a bird
[51:07] watcher I looked into that data it was
[51:09] peer-reviewed data and it was just a
[51:10] total Croc so I uh on my blog I helped
[51:13] debunk that one thing but then somebody
[51:15] emailed me and said you know you should
[51:16] look at the climate thing because it's
[51:18] the same deal that the narrative does
[51:19] not match the data at all so that's how
[51:22] I woke up on climate but then for years
[51:24] I was still believing what my doctor
[51:26] told me I still believe that breakfast
[51:27] was the most important meal of the day
[51:29] and I believe that vaccinations had all
[51:31] been tested there's all kinds of things
[51:34] that I believed for many years that uh I
[51:36] still thought I could trust the experts
[51:38] but now I feel like I have to have to
[51:40] kind of individually look at everything
[51:42] I have to question everything because I
[51:44] don't know which narratives anymore are
[51:46] true I don't know what I'm believing
[51:47] right now is uh is also false I just
[51:50] have to look into everything but I think
[51:51] it's healthy that people are looking
[51:53] into everything these days yeah it's
[51:55] it's it's a health approach to be always
[51:58] critical uh one big F uh thing that is
[52:01] always going on also I I feel like
[52:03] people have have that in a in they have
[52:07] a driven thing where they want to have a
[52:10] stand on something they want to have an
[52:12] opinion on everything and sometimes I
[52:15] feel like it's just good to not have an
[52:17] opinion like just to say like oh I'm not
[52:19] researched enough on that I'm not
[52:20] knowledgeable about something like that
[52:22] this was at least for me always on the
[52:24] climate uh when people ask me because it
[52:26] is is a popular topic uh in the world
[52:29] and people yeah what do you think Robin
[52:30] I'm like I did not do my research sorry
[52:32] I have no opinion on on climate and and
[52:35] people are shocked when I tell them this
[52:36] like people are like what you have to
[52:38] have like the polar bears and I'm like
[52:42] no like I did not do my research like I
[52:44] cannot have an opinion if if I didn't do
[52:46] the research and and people are afraid
[52:48] to to to admit that and there a lot of
[52:51] opinion a lot of topics that I never
[52:53] looked into and that I have no clue
[52:55] about and I will tell one that I have no
[52:57] clue about and I have to do research
[52:58] even with climate uh I didn't do a lot
[53:01] of research like I'm I'm my my starting
[53:04] starting starting point I will still say
[53:06] like oh sorry I have no opinion and I
[53:07] think that's that's a healthy standpoint
[53:10] to say like oh I don't have an opinion
[53:11] on that I have to do my research sorry
[53:13] we cannot disgus this yeah I think
[53:15] that's super healthy I think you're a
[53:17] light years ahead of where I was at your
[53:19] same age so uh yeah I give you kudos for
[53:22] that one example for me is like the
[53:23] Middle East what is the answer what what
[53:26] should anybody do in the Middle East I
[53:27] don't know I I don't understand it so
[53:30] yeah I think more often we need to say I
[53:32] don't know I don't understand it because
[53:34] we we don't understand so many things
[53:37] absolutely and if we don't understand it
[53:40] but still have an opinion we probably
[53:42] just mirroring what we heard the most
[53:45] and that's probably like the mainstream
[53:47] narrative and that's probably really
[53:48] really dangerous but yeah um let's come
[53:51] to the end of the podcast where I asked
[53:53] my guest uh always the same question um
[53:56] what can we learn from you besides all
[53:59] the things that we already talked about
[54:00] know if this counts but just think for
[54:02] yourself that is the number one thing
[54:04] that I like to say to everybody that to
[54:06] my you know I have a couple kids in
[54:08] their 20s but just think for yourself I
[54:10] think that's always important and uh
[54:13] it's so much easier to not do the
[54:15] thinking people it's it's hard to think
[54:17] and it's so much easier to just take
[54:19] somebody else's word for it but um it's
[54:22] hard but thinking for yourself is the
[54:25] thing I'd leave you with that fact check
[54:27] things and just don't accept uh accept
[54:30] what you're told that uh always try to
[54:33] do some sort of checking and some
[54:35] independent checking in what you're told
[54:38] now the other outine as you might know
[54:40] if you have seen my podcast is where end
[54:42] routine of the previous guest is asking
[54:44] a question for the next guest without
[54:46] knowing who the next guest is um all my
[54:48] guests assuming they they are hyper
[54:50] Bitcoin IED guests so I don't know if
[54:54] this um question is suiting for you or
[54:56] if you even have an answer to that but I
[54:58] will still uh just to keep up the enro
[55:01] team ask you the question but you can
[55:03] take the question in whatever way you
[55:05] want to take it um when would you think
[55:07] that an oil producing company would
[55:10] reveal that they're mining Bitcoin with
[55:11] their oil great question when would that
[55:14] happen it seems like it would be a long
[55:16] time I don't know the answer to that I'm
[55:18] trying to think which Oil Company a BP
[55:20] just went out of the onshore win
[55:22] business they just announced that I
[55:24] don't know what that means um so they're
[55:27] getting less woke in that sense I don't
[55:29] know I guess I could see it happening in
[55:31] the next 10 years I've heard other
[55:33] people say we have to wait generations
[55:34] for changes like this but I say I
[55:37] wouldn't be surprised in 10 years if it
[55:39] happens we'll see don't know yeah it's
[55:41] it's interesting how how fast things go
[55:43] I would not have expected that two
[55:46] presidential candidates are on the
[55:49] Bitcoin conference and talking about a
[55:51] Bitcoin reserve a strategic Bitcoin
[55:54] Reserve in an election year like that
[55:56] was that one in Nashville and you were
[55:59] there that completely surprised me on a
[56:02] lot of levels uh because when I came
[56:05] into Bitcoin in 2020 a lot of those
[56:07] things were not there at all and 2020
[56:10] was already really progressed uh
[56:11] compared to like 2015 or 2012 or
[56:14] something like that but that was that
[56:16] was miles away like We already um too
[56:20] far for me like we are already uh too
[56:23] too quick from my understanding I was
[56:25] not expecting Bitcoin to go as quick as
[56:28] as it as it goes but it's really
[56:30] interesting for me to think and one
[56:32] question that I have with with that um
[56:35] is it um is it good uh or how should I
[56:39] ask that question um what is the best
[56:42] way to fuel energy like there's wind
[56:44] there's solar there is uh nuclear energy
[56:47] there all those different um sources um
[56:52] what is from from your persp perspective
[56:54] on the climate the the best source or
[56:57] should we just use all of them whichever
[56:59] is best for us yeah also a good question
[57:02] I've looked into it a lot and I am not
[57:04] at all a fan of wind or solar I think
[57:08] they're almost all in the US at least
[57:09] just about subsidies rather than
[57:11] actually producing energy that's
[57:13] reliable because in both cases you're
[57:15] dependent on the weather and the solar
[57:17] doesn't work at night and the wind
[57:18] doesn't work when the wind isn't blowing
[57:20] so Warren Buffett even said that his
[57:23] company invests enormous amounts or
[57:25] spends a lot on wind power he says we
[57:28] wouldn't even do it except for the the
[57:30] tax breaks so there's a lot of
[57:32] misallocated capital in wind and solar
[57:35] I'm from Minnesota and they're putting
[57:37] in tons of solar facilities that are
[57:39] going to just be buried in snow and it
[57:40] makes no sense with the low Sun angle
[57:43] it's it's crazy they're covering over
[57:44] farmland and then they get destroyed if
[57:46] there's a hail storm there's tons of
[57:48] reasons not to use wind and solar and I
[57:50] think we should just let the market uh
[57:52] if it really does make sense don't
[57:54] subsidize them and if you want to put
[57:56] them up if it makes sense go for it but
[57:58] the taxpayer should be out of that but
[58:00] nuclear power uh so far I've had a lot
[58:02] of people on my podcast talk about that
[58:04] and I am a fan it's good Basel load
[58:06] power and I think it is the way we're
[58:08] going to power our civilization U years
[58:10] from now when we finally do run out of
[58:12] hydrocarbons but yeah some combination
[58:14] of hydrocarbons for transportation and
[58:17] nuclear power for electricity I think
[58:19] those are uh make a lot of sense
[58:21] absolutely it's like in Austria everyone
[58:23] uh that has a company uh gets a an
[58:26] electric car because they are subsidized
[58:28] crazy like you you get a lot of uh
[58:32] incentives to get an electric car in
[58:34] Austria like there are no taxes to it
[58:37] like you get really a lot of incentives
[58:39] to get an electric car in Austria uh
[58:42] when you look deep into especially if
[58:43] you're a company even as a private
[58:45] person just with tax money you get a lot
[58:47] of incentives but if you're a company or
[58:49] your company does it with you there
[58:52] there are like massive Financial
[58:54] incentives to get an electric car which
[58:56] is which is Grace the whole subsidize uh
[58:59] conversation yeah so there's just so so
[59:01] much misallocated Capital it just uh
[59:03] kind of makes me sick so much of this
[59:05] and again the whole idea is we have to
[59:07] drive electric cars because otherwise
[59:10] the Cyclones are going to be worse and
[59:12] we're going to get way worse droughts
[59:13] and our crops are going to fail all of
[59:16] that again is just completely crazy and
[59:19] uh hopefully that'll that'll go away
[59:21] because of course there's all this other
[59:22] mining that you need to produce the
[59:24] batteries and so uh overall the whole
[59:28] idea that if you drive your electric car
[59:29] that uh nature is going to be better or
[59:31] life is going to be better than if you
[59:32] drive a real car uh totally not true
[59:35] then there's this dynamic in California
[59:37] where they're trying to get rid of
[59:38] internal combustion cars and um at the
[59:41] same time they're saying that please
[59:43] don't plug in your electric car because
[59:45] the grid can't handle it so we got these
[59:47] two things we're going to go all
[59:49] electric and don't plug in your car and
[59:52] some people say they want to get us in
[59:53] electric cars just because then they can
[59:55] uh they can control our electric cars
[59:57] and control our mobility and and shut
[59:59] off our ability to travel I don't know
[60:02] uh that might be part of the dynamic
[60:03] there too but uh none of it makes any
[60:06] sense none of it and it's interesting I
[60:09] have driven a Tesla for I think one and
[60:12] a half years uh and I have not done it
[60:15] because of the climate I 100% because uh
[60:19] I like the Cs there's a lot of fun drive
[60:22] around uh and interestingly enough a lot
[60:25] of people came up to like oh are you are
[60:28] you a climate fighter
[60:29] like all of the sudden was associated
[60:32] with that and I'm like that that's bad
[60:33] like that's elen has to fight the image
[60:36] for Tesla that it's that like for by
[60:38] Tesla that I'm not getting into this
[60:40] screen party things that I'm associated
[60:41] with that all of the sun I would love to
[60:43] know what percent of Tesla drivers are
[60:45] that was a big part of their decision to
[60:47] buy a Tesla because they thought they
[60:48] were fixing the climate I have no idea
[60:50] what that number is but I'd like to know
[60:52] I think it's probably high because um El
[60:55] even himself he even on the shareholder
[60:57] meetings and all those things like he
[60:59] pushes that a lot electric cars for the
[61:01] climate and the environment but honestly
[61:04] like they're just fun I think a lot of
[61:06] people just buy them because they are
[61:07] fun they're the the autopilot is really
[61:10] good uh especially compared to all other
[61:13] systems at least that that I have seen
[61:15] uh so like I think I would be
[61:18] interesting to know I have no clue
[61:20] probably like yeah would be interesting
[61:22] but as as I said I have no clue about
[61:24] the statistics um I at least for I'm my
[61:27] purchase was 100% because of fun glad
[61:30] toar that don't I don't drive it now at
[61:33] least um really cool perfect then before
[61:35] I let you go uh question where can
[61:37] people find you ask your questions where
[61:39] can people find your stuff yeah the
[61:41] biggest place is just Tom a Nelson ATX
[61:45] from there you can look at my profile
[61:46] and have a link tree that points you to
[61:48] climate the movie and my substack and
[61:50] everything else but yeah X is where I do
[61:52] most of my stuff these days thank you so
[61:54] much Tom for being on uh also thank you
[61:56] so much for everyone that is watching
[61:57] and listening to the podcast uh as
[61:59] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[62:01] another episode bye-bye
[62:03] [Music]
