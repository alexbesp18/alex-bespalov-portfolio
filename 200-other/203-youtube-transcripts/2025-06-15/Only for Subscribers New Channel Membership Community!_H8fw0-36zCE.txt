[00:00] welcome to the channel memberships of
[00:01] the Robin S Robin S podcast um and I
[00:06] don't call it Robin S or the robins or
[00:08] the cers or something like weird with my
[00:10] name I call it Satoshi because I think
[00:13] we are all actually Satoshi and that's
[00:16] why I wanted to call the channel
[00:18] membership Satoshi and we even have a
[00:20] telegram group that is called team
[00:23] Satoshi because we all in the marketing
[00:25] team we all in the team for for sound
[00:28] money for toi so like uh that's why I
[00:32] did not wanted to call it anything with
[00:33] Robin S podcast it's just team zoshi
[00:36] it's something has nothing or little to
[00:39] know to do with me it has to do with
[00:41] Bitcoin and that's why I also have the
[00:43] podcast I want to provide a stage for
[00:46] bitcoiners and for Bitcoin and I want to
[00:48] push the Bitcoin and the sound money and
[00:50] the freedom narrative out there but why
[00:53] even offering Channel memberships I
[00:55] asked this question myself so long and I
[00:58] never got an answer on that's why I
[01:00] never really took the channel membership
[01:01] serious but in Bitcoin Brock I got to
[01:04] know about the magical thing that
[01:06] happens when people come together and
[01:08] talk to each other and that's what I
[01:10] want to do because Bitcoin brag is once
[01:12] a we once a year then there's other uh
[01:15] other big conferences there are local
[01:17] meetups and stuff like that but the
[01:19] magical thing that happened in Bitcoin
[01:20] brag all around the world pit uh people
[01:24] were coming to brag and were meeting
[01:26] there and forming connections forming
[01:29] alliances forming groups and I loved it
[01:32] so much and I was loving that I could be
[01:35] part of the the people that made those
[01:38] connections possible I was standing
[01:40] there and people came up to me because
[01:42] they recognized me either they were fans
[01:44] of the podcast or there were speakers uh
[01:46] of my podcast they were guests of my
[01:48] podcast whatever they were but they knew
[01:50] me from somewhere and they each other
[01:53] did not knew each other but they got to
[01:55] know each other because they both knew
[01:58] me so I was like I can do something like
[02:00] that that's available all year round and
[02:04] every day of the year and we can make a
[02:07] monthly Meetup online where all the
[02:10] great people from America Europe India
[02:14] Asia Africa everywhere can actually come
[02:17] together and talk Bitcoin and that's
[02:20] team Satoshi that's the mission of Team
