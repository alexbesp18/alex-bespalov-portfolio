[00:00] how high is the threat that Bitcoin C
[00:02] developers coming together and and doing
[00:04] something hurtful to bitcoin the main
[00:06] danger is that something gets done
[00:08] without it being noticed the most
[00:10] amazing threat that Bitcoin ever
[00:12] overcame was 2017 with the block size
[00:14] war that was that was a big one C was
[00:16] deactivated for a reason there were some
[00:18] issues with it is the Bitcoin base layer
[00:21] kind of done like how much more
[00:23] developments uh will that come on the
[00:25] base layer there's still things that
[00:27] that we can improve
[00:32] I've done now almost 220 interviews um
[00:36] it's almost a little embarrassing for me
[00:38] I've never done an interview with a
[00:41] Bitcoin Cod developer so so that that
[00:44] that should have came earlier I feel
[00:46] like but now we're here now now first
[00:49] you're the first one H so you will get
[00:51] all my beginner questions also as you're
[00:54] the first one H you have to dive me uh
[00:57] get through that also and we also I also
[00:59] want to talk with you about the human
[01:01] rights Foundation that you're also uh
[01:03] working with it's also really
[01:05] interesting connection between human
[01:07] rights and and Bitcoin I love what Alex
[01:10] gladin also is doing in that regard um
[01:12] but yeah let's let's just dive in like
[01:15] how did you become a Bitcoin
[01:17] co-developer and why is that the thing
[01:20] that you chose to dedicate your life
[01:22] to yeah sure um so I mean the the the
[01:27] first of all I was a developer and um I
[01:30] was I was passionate about technology
[01:32] always always like to learn new things
[01:34] and jump into um new topics and um so I
[01:39] was working with startups for quite a
[01:41] while before really uh starting to work
[01:43] on bitcoin full-time like that that that
[01:46] already like gave me kind of an
[01:47] environment where um I could kind of
[01:50] like always see and understand the full
[01:52] stack of things and and like see see
[01:55] kind of how everything works that's
[01:57] something that's also very important to
[01:58] me um and I discovered Bitcoin um
[02:03] somewhat early when when it was pretty
[02:05] new but kind of really didn't really
[02:07] understand it at the time um I think
[02:10] that's uh maybe interesting now that AI
[02:12] is also the Hot Topic like um I I was
[02:16] like to say like I initially I looked at
[02:18] Bitcoin similar to how you would look at
[02:20] AI like I tried to understand how
[02:22] Bitcoin could help a business be more
[02:24] efficient but of course that's a very
[02:26] bad way of trying to apply Bitcoin kind
[02:29] of as a tool in the business setting so
[02:31] that's why initially I failed to
[02:33] understand Bitcoin and how it could be
[02:34] relevant and that's why um I only I only
[02:37] started taking more seriously and and
[02:39] Diving deeper um years later so um I um
[02:45] really that and this I think it's a good
[02:47] connection to the hrf as well to the
[02:49] work that hrf is doing like really what
[02:51] what like made it click for me was the
[02:54] refugee crisis in Europe 2015 2016 when
[02:58] um I kind of like
[03:00] you read the stories in the news all the
[03:02] time about people like trying to make
[03:04] their way over the Mediterranean Sea or
[03:06] um coming across other paths and then
[03:09] relying on on um human traffickers um
[03:13] and human traffickers always take all of
[03:15] the money all of the values that they
[03:17] have with them um and kind of at that
[03:19] point I remembered that one of the
[03:21] features of Bitcoin is that you could
[03:23] like remember the pass phrase in your
[03:25] head and potentially P cross borders and
[03:28] and no nobody could that that that you
[03:30] have valuables on you basically um and
[03:33] so kind of yeah there was there was
[03:34] really a trigger for me to get deeper
[03:36] into it and at the time uh the lightning
[03:40] network was also very new um and so
[03:42] that's really the first part of Bitcoin
[03:44] where I really Dove deep um around 2016
[03:49] um where like the the base layer while I
[03:52] while I was understanding how it worked
[03:54] um on a on a higher level um it also
[03:58] felt like kind of done and like not
[04:00] something where I felt like I could
[04:02] really contribute that much um and while
[04:06] while lightning was really like those
[04:08] were the Reckless times right um that's
[04:11] when you if to in order to participate
[04:13] you had to set up your own note there
[04:14] was just no other way um and everyone
[04:17] was doing like crazy stuff and and just
[04:20] just yeah just trying stuff out so like
[04:22] I I built like a vending machine for
[04:24] example where you could buy uh sneakers
[04:26] bars with uh with lightning um and and
[04:30] this yeah like it it was nice to play
[04:32] around on like application layer stuff
[04:34] but also um through lightning I learned
[04:37] more and more about Bitcoin on the base
[04:39] layer um and yeah just basically saw
[04:43] more and more how everything relies on
[04:46] on the base layer and um If we're honest
[04:48] also everything then relies on bitcoin
[04:51] core because it's the predominant note
[04:53] that is run on the network um and I was
[04:56] still thinking about like working more
[04:59] on life in um when I was invited to come
[05:03] to chenco to New York um basically for
[05:07] for short internship residency like the
[05:10] program is not really active at the
[05:12] moment but they have like online
[05:13] programs now that are comparable um and
[05:16] there I was in a room with a lot of
[05:18] people that worked on bitcoin core and
[05:19] so I could learn a lot more how Bitcoin
[05:22] core Works in in a short period of time
[05:24] and that
[05:25] also really was the first time that I
[05:27] understood it in so Much Death that I
[05:29] really saw more and more places where I
[05:32] could be helpful where I could
[05:33] contribute um and um yeah so that's what
[05:37] I started doing then and um in the
[05:39] beginning I was like okay this is like
[05:41] interesting learning experience but then
[05:43] um after some time I was saw like okay
[05:46] it feels like I'm being useful here so I
[05:48] will continue to do it um and yeah since
[05:51] since that time so since 2019 um I've
[05:54] been continually doing it not full time
[05:57] as I'm doing it now like on and off uh
[05:59] full time like the grand the grand
[06:01] landscape was a bit tricky at times but
[06:04] um yeah now um I'm uh with Brink uh
[06:07] since last year um and also supported
[06:10] for some research work from hrf um so
[06:13] yeah I'm doing it fulltime now for uh
[06:16] since since early last year uh what is
[06:18] Brink really quickly Brink is a
[06:21] nonprofit that funds Bitcoin development
[06:24] um and primarily it's focused on work
[06:27] that is uh um
[06:30] on bitcoin core um but people that are
[06:34] funded also work on other stuff so some
[06:36] people for example work on fuzzing and
[06:38] so they do the fuzzing work on bitcoin
[06:40] core but also they fuzz other projects
[06:42] in the Bitcoin space um and for example
[06:44] I am primarily working on bitcoin core
[06:47] but also I do um like the cesa research
[06:49] stuff that we will talk about later that
[06:51] hrf is supporting as well um and I'm uh
[06:55] for example doing some tools that that
[06:58] are helping them with providing data for
[07:01] Bitcoin core um so the as map project
[07:04] there I've built a tool uh with which
[07:06] you can actually build the maps um so
[07:09] you you're not really um uh you don't
[07:12] really have much guidelines in general
[07:14] what you what you're supposed to work on
[07:16] but um the primary focus I would say in
[07:19] general of the organization is support
[07:20] Bitcoin cwork um and then um also of
[07:24] course everything that that help the
[07:26] Bitcoin core the Bitcoin ecosystem in
[07:28] general how many uh Bitcoin core
[07:31] developers uh are full-time or like
[07:34] part-time working on that is there like
[07:36] is there estimate on on that can you uh
[07:40] is there like yeah so um there is a a
[07:44] blog post um that like um Adam Jonas
[07:48] somebody from from chain code who is
[07:50] working on um kind of like getting
[07:54] getting kind of the the status of
[07:56] Bitcoin core development like once per
[07:58] year he puts out a um
[08:00] a post and that features some statistics
[08:03] um so there the bar I would say is quite
[08:05] low to for what he calls a contributor
[08:08] um so I think he call somebody
[08:11] contributor who has like written five
[08:13] comments or so or like um um in terms of
[08:18] commits like who has made five commits
[08:19] per year um I think that like includes a
[08:22] lot of people that are not really doing
[08:23] it full-time um so since you asked
[08:26] fulltime so I would say um the people
[08:29] that are really doing anything that is
[08:31] close to full-time like actually uh
[08:34] working every week on bitcoin core um
[08:36] like I would say like generally working
[08:38] fulltime on bitcoin and then like every
[08:40] week do something in Bitcoin core I
[08:42] would say that is a small group of of
[08:44] like 20 to 30 people or so so it's
[08:47] really not a big group and so that I I
[08:49] also wanted to say that when you said
[08:51] I'm the first one to come to your show
[08:53] or that you that you get on your show
[08:54] like that's totally fine like there's
[08:56] not a lot of people um that really work
[08:58] on on bitcoin core full time and um not
[09:01] all of them like to do interviews um and
[09:04] so yeah I think that's uh that's all
[09:08] right yeah thank you for coming on and
[09:11] yeah it's it's it's my unorganized
[09:14] invite still now like I'm I just like
[09:16] when something in my feet comes and oh
[09:18] that's interesting then I invite as I
[09:20] did it with you so when I if I would be
[09:23] a little bit more organized with whom I
[09:25] invite and how I should invite uh this
[09:27] will come in the future as the podcast
[09:29] grows and as the the list of potential
[09:31] guests get bigger uh but as now it's
[09:34] it's just uh chaotic and in in my head
[09:37] somewhere um for all the I'm aware at
[09:41] every Bitcoin conversation there's
[09:43] someone new in there uh and uh when you
[09:46] think about developers in in a normal
[09:50] project like in a centralized I don't
[09:52] know SAS business uh the developers can
[09:56] put a lot in the code and they have a
[09:58] lot of yeah Freedom there because they
[10:01] only need basically like maybe one or
[10:03] two people to agree with them and I
[10:05] think a lot of people maybe come with
[10:08] that mindset to bitcoin core developers
[10:10] and and think like oh Bitcoin core
[10:12] developers they have a lot of um power
[10:15] and influence over the Bitcoin um
[10:18] Network maybe maybe let's have a little
[10:20] bit in the beginning and like um how
[10:24] high is the threat uh in your case that
[10:26] Bitcoin core developers like group of 20
[10:28] or 30 people that I actually doing it um
[10:31] coming together and and doing something
[10:33] uh hurtful to to bitcoin even though
[10:35] they they don't want to do that but
[10:37] let's imagine if they want to do that
[10:39] how high is the threat of doing that uh
[10:41] and uh what is the role of a Bitcoin Cod
[10:44] developer in the overall ecosystem in
[10:46] general um so you mean basically that
[10:49] that the 2030 people uh would
[10:51] collaborate and and do something hurtful
[10:54] um yeah I mean it's uh our
[10:59] I guess 20 to 30 is not I guess a huge
[11:03] group to corrupt uh in in general like
[11:07] in in grand scheme of things um but I
[11:09] think like when you when you look at
[11:11] kind of the history of the people of how
[11:13] they contribute how how they came into
[11:15] it where they are
[11:17] geographically um like these are very
[11:20] different people and they they do it for
[11:22] different motivations they have
[11:24] different ideas um and so uh like some
[11:28] of them were together in organizations
[11:31] like for example Brink like there's five
[11:33] or six people for example part of that
[11:35] that that are affiliated with Brink for
[11:37] example um but U like in order to like
[11:42] really catch them all and then not be a
[11:44] canary anywhere like I I would have a
[11:47] hard time believing that that's really
[11:48] going to be the case so um of course
[11:51] like in in such a threat scenario like
[11:53] more is always better um and of course
[11:57] there are other stop gaps so um
[12:00] hopefully more people than just the 20
[12:02] to 30 people look at the code and like
[12:04] actually test the code and verify that
[12:07] that the code says what what what they
[12:10] are saying so I mean if if really like
[12:13] there were were like let's say like more
[12:16] realistic I think is that two or three
[12:18] people would collaborate um and um try
[12:22] to put something in the code that is not
[12:25] really like that that introduces a
[12:26] vulnerability right um and so with two
[12:30] or three people like you can you can
[12:32] make it appear like there's like one one
[12:34] person implements it and the two others
[12:36] are reviewing it and saying like yeah
[12:37] this is fine um but it would need to be
[12:40] covered and you would basically like it
[12:43] would really like seem like it's fine um
[12:46] and I think that's a pretty high bar um
[12:49] even like I think you would really need
[12:52] to hide that very very well um in order
[12:55] in order to get something in like for
[12:57] example like a change that is just in
[12:59] the test codee or like an a change in
[13:02] the documentation um that's something
[13:04] where two or three people would be fine
[13:06] like something that is just reviewed by
[13:08] two people or so that would get merged
[13:10] um that is possible but something that
[13:12] touches more sensitive part of the code
[13:15] like for example the wallet or something
[13:18] that touches um P2P um that is already
[13:22] reviewed by by a lot more people um and
[13:25] requires more people to say okay this is
[13:27] this is all right um and then if you
[13:29] look at consensus cor like consensus
[13:31] changes like tap rot for example was um
[13:34] reviewed by I don't know 20 people or so
[13:37] and these were also a lot of people that
[13:39] are not really active in Bitcoin core
[13:41] but that came into Bitcoin core just to
[13:43] look at this particular code change and
[13:46] and give feedback on it so I think like
[13:49] core has a good understanding of which
[13:51] changes are more dangerous than others
[13:54] um and then depending on how many uh how
[13:58] dangerous they are um there's a
[13:59] requirement for more people to to look
[14:01] at it and also um sometimes with
[14:04] interesting changes also people that
[14:06] have maybe not been active for a while
[14:08] but like maybe attaches code that they
[14:10] have introduced like five years ago and
[14:12] then they become curious like why why
[14:14] does somebody change my code that I
[14:15] wrote five years ago where I had very
[14:17] clear ideas why why I did it this way
[14:20] like maybe they come back and take a
[14:21] look at this as well um and there's also
[14:24] like um people or or if they don't see
[14:26] it themselves like maybe somebody else
[14:28] asked them like hey you wrote this five
[14:30] years ago right you can see it in the in
[14:32] the history in in git um and ask them to
[14:35] look um then um they can um they can be
[14:39] activated basically and and asked to to
[14:41] give feedback as well so um yeah so I
[14:46] mean like you I think the the main
[14:48] danger is that something gets done
[14:49] without it being noticed um like once
[14:52] it's noticed um I'm not sure if that's
[14:54] clear to to everyone who's listening but
[14:56] like once it's noticed of course like
[14:59] everyone can can run their own uh Fork
[15:01] of Bitcoin core and so if it turns out
[15:04] like part of the developers are corrupt
[15:06] um then a new Fork would get done and
[15:09] then people could run that version of
[15:11] the um of the software rather than than
[15:14] the um than the corrupt corrupted
[15:17] version yeah and I think that's the
[15:20] that's the biggest thing like even if
[15:21] there's something coming in you can run
[15:24] your own note uh you you can choose your
[15:26] own version uh and therefore like a lot
[15:30] more people uh look actually at at
[15:33] Bitcoin than than just the cor
[15:35] developers in in in that regard and if
[15:37] there would be something in there that
[15:39] would as As We Know It uh things spread
[15:42] fast in in the Bitcoin Community uh and
[15:46] especially something that would maybe
[15:47] even be a threat to bitcoin that would
[15:49] be highly discussed on on every uh
[15:52] platform and I think uh I always look
[15:55] back a little bit when when I see threed
[15:57] models to to bitcoin like uh for me the
[16:00] most amazing threat that Bitcoin ever
[16:04] overcame was 2017 with the block size
[16:06] war that was that was a big one uh and
[16:09] and I feel like Bitcoin is now quite
[16:13] stable and and and and I I feel very
[16:16] safe with Bitcoin like the the the
[16:18] overall thing where I'm like I'm
[16:20] learning since four years now really
[16:21] deeply in Bitcoin especially now with
[16:23] the podcast with every day new podcast
[16:25] guest um just learning deep and deeper
[16:28] and learning about all the the threet
[16:29] models also it's like oh yeah it's gets
[16:32] more safe like every day and a new
[16:35] person coming in um but I guess new
[16:37] people have have the concern a lot when
[16:40] when they come in and oh they wait there
[16:41] only a few a handful of of of of Bitcoin
[16:44] core developers yeah but this there's a
[16:47] whole ecosystem to that like there's
[16:49] there are node Runners there miners
[16:51] there's uh the whole group that that are
[16:54] depending on on bitcoin that have the
[16:56] life savings in Bitcoin and they they
[16:57] would react to C certain type if there
[17:01] something in there like select a lot of
[17:03] interesting things in there to protect
[17:05] Bitcoin yes and it's a good question
[17:07] because the like it really like what I
[17:10] said like really touches on the the the
[17:12] most scarse resource that we that we
[17:15] have in in bitco cor is review time like
[17:18] it would be great if like the average po
[17:21] request wouldn't look be looked at by
[17:23] five people but instead it would be
[17:24] looked at by 10 people um uh and so
[17:29] but unfortunately there's just not
[17:30] enough people so but like we just
[17:33] recently had some announcement of new
[17:35] people getting funded um particularly
[17:38] also for for um stability uh work and
[17:42] for review work um and so um that's
[17:46] great I see that there there we will see
[17:49] new people coming in um into the team
[17:51] and that they have a really a focus also
[17:53] on on reviewing um and I hope that like
[17:56] that will get kind of the average number
[17:58] of review On Any Given pull request um
[18:01] up and and yeah kind of make make the
[18:04] whole development PO process a bit more
[18:07] enjoyable because like if you heard
[18:09] anything about bitco core development
[18:10] probably it's said it's very slow um and
[18:14] um yeah but I mean slow is also because
[18:17] it's more secure and like we we just
[18:20] don't merge anything if there haven't
[18:22] been enough eyes on it so is the
[18:24] slowness uh a feature a security feature
[18:27] in the end
[18:29] well I mean if
[18:33] it's like if if there's enough people
[18:35] looking at a pro request and and uh
[18:38] saying it's okay within a short amount
[18:40] of time then it something can get merged
[18:43] also pretty quickly um but often times
[18:45] that's just not the case and then it's
[18:47] also accepted that is fine that the PO
[18:49] request is lying there for months or
[18:51] even years like you can see many
[18:53] examples of that in in Bitcoin cor so
[18:55] let's say uh it's more a second order
[18:57] effect of the mindedness of the project
[19:01] rather than a feature um so yeah um it
[19:06] it just happens to be that um when
[19:08] there's not none enough people there
[19:11] that it feels secure to merge then then
[19:13] it's fine to take long and like there's
[19:15] no um or very very limited um uh drive
[19:22] or appetite I say I would say for for
[19:24] example merging something before a
[19:26] release like we have a release upcoming
[19:28] now which is version 28 um and so
[19:31] there's some new features in there um
[19:34] but if there's like like a new feature
[19:36] and like it hasn't really gotten any
[19:38] review and like you would drive it like
[19:40] say like hey let's get this into version
[19:42] 28 like let's get it done let's let's
[19:45] merge it it's cool um like that it's not
[19:48] something that that that happens um
[19:50] usually like either stuff is very close
[19:53] to being ready or if something like if
[19:55] there's a buck found like then it can
[19:58] get like in quickly um the the buck fix
[20:02] um for that like we we have some
[20:04] extended period of time for merging bug
[20:07] fixes after we have already closed the
[20:09] door for new features into a version um
[20:13] U but yeah this like kind of like very
[20:15] for getting stuff done very short term
[20:17] is is very limited um because yeah
[20:20] limited resources and security
[20:23] mindness it's also interesting because
[20:25] you mentioned in the beginning that when
[20:28] you came came into this ecosystem that
[20:31] you thought that the Bitcoin layer one
[20:34] like the base layer is kind of done
[20:36] already as kind of already ready and so
[20:40] you focus more on on lightning um is the
[20:44] Bitcoin based layer kind of done like
[20:47] how much more developments uh will there
[20:50] come and and how how much more developed
[20:53] uh can can that be and this is is maybe
[20:57] more development even dangerous to to
[20:59] bitcoin um so there's there's many parts
[21:03] to this so first of all like at at the
[21:07] time when when I had that perception it
[21:10] was that yeah I really just didn't know
[21:13] enough like there's um a lot of things
[21:15] that need to be done and I mean like
[21:17] there's this you kind of hinting I guess
[21:20] at the horific uh argument by by um
[21:24] Michael sailor so um first of all like
[21:26] even if you would say like we don't
[21:28] really change anything on the Bitcoin
[21:30] core protocol anymore um the project on
[21:33] on the Bitcoin protocol um the Bitcoin
[21:35] core project would still need
[21:36] maintenance in order to function um on
[21:40] new operating systems on new computers
[21:43] that come out um in order to to um fix
[21:47] potential bucks that are still uh being
[21:49] discovered um so like that that alone um
[21:54] could could keep the PE the group of
[21:55] people that are working on it now busy
[21:57] also for for the next few years and
[22:00] potentially forever I would say um then
[22:04] of course there are still things to
[22:05] improve like not not even talking about
[22:08] bucks but like in terms of performance
[22:10] um that there's we always find new stuff
[22:13] that can be done in a better way um the
[22:15] the code base also can be improved in
[22:17] terms of like how um easy it is to
[22:20] understand so there's a lot of stuff in
[22:21] there that is still from like satosi
[22:23] times in terms of like how variables are
[22:25] named and then you make a change
[22:27] somewhere and then the variable name
[22:28] doesn't really mean what it was supposed
[22:31] to mean anymore um and so all of these
[22:34] things are also still like there's a lot
[22:36] of stuff that we can still clean up and
[22:38] make it easier to understand for other
[22:40] people that maybe want to come in and
[22:41] start contributing or that want to just
[22:44] review um changes um uh so so these are
[22:49] I would say categories that we really
[22:51] don't want to miss either way even if
[22:53] you kind of like say okay the base layer
[22:55] is is finished as a as a protocol um uh
[22:59] and then I I would say on the protocol
[23:02] itself on the base layer I think um
[23:05] there's still things that that we can
[23:06] improve um so um just on the P2P side
[23:11] like not not talking about consensus um
[23:14] I think there are very interesting
[23:15] things coming up um like um the um
[23:20] package relay for example um a lot of
[23:23] stuff is is or a lot of resources are
[23:25] going into in general into understanding
[23:27] how the m functions how pinning attacks
[23:30] can be uh mitigated um and this really
[23:33] helps Layer Two protocols like lightning
[23:36] Network um that is really the main
[23:38] driver for for this this kind of work um
[23:41] and so um I think like lightning works
[23:45] well I think but there's still a lot of
[23:47] issues also that need to be um that need
[23:50] to be fixed in order for it to to Really
[23:54] um support kind of the the next the next
[23:57] wave I would say
[23:59] um so uh this is part of that and so um
[24:02] that is that is also work I think that
[24:04] we want to that you want to continue
[24:05] doing um and then I'm not like um the
[24:10] the covenants have been the driver for
[24:13] potential consensus changes and that
[24:15] whole conversation in the future um but
[24:18] obviously I'm also working on Caesar
[24:19] which is another um consensus change um
[24:24] suggestion um so
[24:27] um because of what I'm working on but
[24:30] also in general I think Covenant can
[24:32] bring interesting new features to
[24:34] bitcoin um which will allow us to kind
[24:37] of take next step of uh uh layer twos
[24:41] and like potential scaling solutions
[24:44] that don't require any trust like ecash
[24:48] for example is also something that a lot
[24:49] of people are excited about at the
[24:51] moment but it requires trust like
[24:52] there's still the possibility that um
[24:55] the the mint that you're using um goes
[24:57] away or that it uh starts implementing
[25:00] kyc um so I think we shouldn't stop uh
[25:04] there and we should try to to take a
[25:06] Next Step so um and and yeah we need
[25:09] consensus changes for that really
[25:12] interesting you made the differentiation
[25:15] between P2P and consensus is is that
[25:18] different parts of Bitcoin core or like
[25:20] what what is that um yeah so I mean the
[25:22] P2P layer is how how the nodes talk to
[25:25] each other right um and so a lot of
[25:29] things can go wrong there as well but
[25:32] and so for example you could like see a
[25:34] network split or so um but this is not
[25:37] uh part of consensus in general
[25:39] consensus is like which which blocks you
[25:42] accept right um and so um there is
[25:46] another thing that often like for for
[25:48] for new people that is maybe a bit hard
[25:51] to understand but there's a on the P2P
[25:53] layer we have policy um so policy and
[25:56] consensus are different
[25:59] um policy is more restrictive than
[26:02] consensus um because when you get uh
[26:06] send like a transaction for example over
[26:08] policy uh over over the P2P Network and
[26:12] this transaction for example is um yeah
[26:16] it's it's it's paying a certain amount
[26:18] of fee it pays like one satosi per
[26:20] rebite right um and this this
[26:23] transaction would be fine to includ in
[26:24] block and then let's say like I sent you
[26:27] another transaction that Al Al pays the
[26:29] same amount of uh uh
[26:32] um same fees same fee rate um but it's
[26:35] just a little bit different like it uses
[26:37] a different output like you can you can
[26:39] tweak a transaction right without really
[26:41] changing it materially um but but you
[26:44] can make tweak through transaction like
[26:46] let's say I put an OP return in there
[26:48] and I just changed the input the the
[26:49] content of the op return um uh every
[26:52] time and so then I could send you like
[26:54] tons and tons of these transactions and
[26:56] they could basically like denial of
[26:58] service attack you um by making it like
[27:01] like sending you valid transactions all
[27:03] of these transactions would be valid to
[27:04] be included in a block but um as a note
[27:09] I don't want you to to send me all of
[27:10] this data because it's it's garbage like
[27:12] um uh so I don't want to be attacked and
[27:14] so for example a policy rule is that I
[27:17] want like when you replace a transaction
[27:19] when you send a replacement transaction
[27:21] that pays the same fee or like like I
[27:24] basically ask you to pay a bit more in
[27:26] fees um and we call that pay for the
[27:28] traffic so I accept like more traffic
[27:30] from you but then you should also pay
[27:32] for uh for that in the in the in the um
[27:36] in the sense of a higher um fee rate
[27:39] yeah so policy rules that kind of
[27:41] unintuitive I guess when when you knew
[27:43] but the policy rules are tighter than
[27:45] consensus rules um you reject stuff on
[27:48] the P2P layer that you would be fine to
[27:51] accept when it's in a block um uh but
[27:54] yeah that that shows how how these two
[27:56] worlds are different and and both are
[27:59] important but um P2P layer is still
[28:02] quite a bit less important than
[28:04] consensus really interesting and for for
[28:07] me for it's also interesting uh the
[28:09] future changes I think governance is
[28:11] something that comes up I think that
[28:14] came up like a lot of times already in
[28:16] the podcast like five six guests uh uh
[28:19] mentioned it that it's important that we
[28:21] need to implement this I never heard
[28:23] someone uh speaking against it on the
[28:25] podcast till now uh maybe let's dive a
[28:29] little bit deeper in that um what will
[28:32] it enable and and why should why is it
[28:35] important or do you think it's important
[28:37] uh covenants right it yeah yeah yeah um
[28:43] so Covenant it's um I first of all like
[28:48] I I have to say like I haven't really
[28:51] studied covenants in general and also
[28:54] like the
[28:55] proposals um that are
[28:58] uh being made like for for some some
[29:01] time over the last couple of months we
[29:02] had like it felt like a new proposal was
[29:04] coming up every week um and so I I
[29:07] cannot really speak as an authority on
[29:09] this because I have I don't feel like I
[29:11] have spent enough time on it so uh all I
[29:15] can say in general I think that there is
[29:17] very interesting use cases and people
[29:19] that work on interesting layer TOS um
[29:22] see it as a potential Improvement uh for
[29:26] for them to continue their work and for
[29:27] them to to put their ideas into a
[29:30] reality um and from the downsides that
[29:33] I've that I've seen uh being laid out um
[29:36] weighing against the the upside I think
[29:38] it's something that is worth that to do
[29:40] and uh for example this is a kind of
[29:43] recent development but for example the
[29:46] Russell has put out this um uh great
[29:50] script restoration project or
[29:53] presentation um and so he basically
[29:55] suggests um reactiv ating opcat um and
[30:00] also a couple of other opcodes but opcat
[30:02] is kind of like the Blockbuster opcode
[30:03] that that people are very excited about
[30:05] like if you're on bitcoin Twitter you
[30:07] certainly have seen something about opet
[30:08] probably in the last couple of weeks um
[30:11] but really the the main I would say that
[30:14] the really the important part or the
[30:15] part that really uh kind of excites me
[30:18] about this proposal is that he also
[30:21] spent some time in like like suggesting
[30:24] how it can be made safe because like
[30:26] there's always with cat like opcat was
[30:28] deactivated for a reason there were some
[30:30] issues with it and um so there's really
[30:35] like people were talking about features
[30:37] a lot but not really like how we can
[30:39] make really the use of these new up
[30:41] codes safe um and basically what what
[30:44] Russy has done is um he has suggested a
[30:47] new kind of way of evaluating of how
[30:51] computationally um expensive these op
[30:54] codes are um and so this is then a
[30:57] consensus change um U but like we when
[31:01] we look at Bitcoin script um right now
[31:04] there there are also rules in place um
[31:07] and they say okay like I want to um I
[31:11] allow a certain number of basically
[31:13] computation like um I I allow some kind
[31:16] of amount of computation that I need to
[31:18] do in order to validate a block um but
[31:21] at this point it's too much um and right
[31:24] now we're mostly doing this around uh
[31:26] signatures so signatures are expensive
[31:28] to validate and so um you can construct
[31:31] blocks in a way that there's a lot of
[31:33] signatures that need to be validated um
[31:36] and at some point currently the consens
[31:39] rules say no this is too many signatures
[31:41] I don't want to do this it takes too
[31:42] much time um and so then a drob block is
[31:46] rejected um and so basically what an
[31:48] opat OP code does is it allows more ways
[31:52] to to do this kind of thing like to to
[31:55] make it too computationally expensive
[31:58] um and Rusty has suggested kind of way
[32:01] of calculating how expensive is this and
[32:04] then yeah suggested also kind of a
[32:06] boundary that we want to introduce of uh
[32:09] rejecting what is the point where we
[32:11] reject this so this is a very important
[32:13] piece I think of um getting covenants to
[32:17] to to closer to reality um yeah like on
[32:21] on the features I think I'm I'm just the
[32:23] I'm not the right person like there's
[32:25] there's people that can speak for hours
[32:26] about like all of the all great things
[32:28] that that you can build I think like the
[32:31] there's a potential that that it can
[32:33] just take Bitcoin scaling what I
[32:35] mentioned before that it can take that
[32:36] forward um and if there's if there's
[32:39] potentially a path then we should um
[32:41] yeah leave the door open to to kind of
[32:45] um exploit that um I I always like to
[32:48] say like why why do I not work on ecash
[32:51] personally like why when like before
[32:55] lightning came around um if you had
[32:57] asked me like okay what's the next step
[32:59] for Bitcoin like can we scale it to um
[33:03] is is there a way to to scale it to
[33:05] whatever you say is like kind of The
[33:07] Benchmark that you want to put to to
[33:08] lightning I would have probably said no
[33:10] I cannot see a way to do that in
[33:12] trustless way and then of course like
[33:14] people that are very smart came up with
[33:16] lightning um and so yeah just because I
[33:20] cannot imagine what the next step is um
[33:22] I would say like maybe somebody who's
[33:25] who's very smart comes up with it and
[33:27] and I can see that there's a lot of
[33:28] people working on that um that are very
[33:31] smart so um I would say yeah there's
[33:33] there's potential that something is
[33:34] coming that we don't really see coming
[33:36] yet um maybe but that that will be a new
[33:39] breakthrough similar to what lightning
[33:40] did um and so yeah that's that's why
[33:44] also I would just say like let's keep
[33:46] the door open for for proposals that
[33:48] governments if you watch or listen to my
[33:51] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[33:53] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[33:56] most important step is to keep the
[33:58] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:01] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:03] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[34:06] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[34:08] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[34:10] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[34:13] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[34:17] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[34:21] robobin to get your bitbox and if you
[34:23] really want to bulletproof your self
[34:26] custody setup your security setup and
[34:28] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[34:31] have to talk to the Bitcoin way if you
[34:34] go to the Bitcoin way.com
[34:36] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[34:40] free call where you can dive deep with
[34:43] them if your self custody setup is
[34:46] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[34:49] maybe might be improvable or your
[34:51] digital footprint in general is secure
[34:55] they are the experts in cyber security
[34:58] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[35:01] secure sovereign individual in general
[35:04] and last but not least I have something
[35:06] completely new for you guys I partnered
[35:10] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[35:13] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:16] saw created by anyone look at that
[35:19] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[35:21] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[35:24] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[35:28] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[35:30] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[35:34] make sure to check out the link in the
[35:35] description for this amazing coin
[35:38] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[35:40] amazing I love them so much it was
[35:42] really hard for me to pick the one that
[35:44] I want to have because there are a lot
[35:46] of great options I went with the new
[35:49] transparency Edition they're all limited
[35:52] so grab yours those will not be
[35:55] available for a long time but there will
[35:57] come new models and new amazing designs
[36:00] along the way yeah I think it it's
[36:02] really interesting for me this whole
[36:03] topic I mean obviously I I actually have
[36:05] a software developer background I was
[36:07] three years a software developer but I
[36:10] stopped that because I was not good in
[36:12] it just I was just not good in it and I
[36:16] didn't enjoy it too much so it's not not
[36:19] something that I pursued um so I looked
[36:23] also in the beginning a little bit into
[36:24] Bitcoin oh can I do something developing
[36:27] uh but as as developing is not my main
[36:29] uh thing it's interesting how how deep
[36:32] that uh that rabbit hole is and how much
[36:35] how much there is to discover even 15
[36:38] years uh later do you think um we we
[36:41] might come to a point where we we
[36:45] reached um a state where we don't have a
[36:48] lot of proposals where like Bitcoin is
[36:51] already in like almost every hand and we
[36:54] only do some maintenance as you said
[36:56] before some maintenance some small um
[36:59] comparability things maybe some some
[37:02] things like um we have a small buck that
[37:05] we found and and we do it or will there
[37:07] also come bigger
[37:09] changes um along the way always as
[37:13] technology always advances and then also
[37:15] the threet models of those other
[37:18] Technologies advances and so like
[37:20] Bitcoin also has to advance to always be
[37:22] the most secure uh and decentralized uh
[37:25] layer um yeah I mean like the first of
[37:28] all like in terms of scaling right you
[37:30] you said like there's Bitcoin in every
[37:32] hand I mean like in order to make that
[37:34] possible in a rustless way like in order
[37:37] for not everyone to have a coinbase
[37:38] account like that's uh something where
[37:41] where we still need probably these
[37:43] changes as as we just
[37:45] discussed
[37:47] um and
[37:50] um aside from that um honestly can you
[37:54] can you can you repeat the last part of
[37:56] the question again it's uh uh I I was
[37:59] just wondering if we come to a state uh
[38:02] ever in the Bitcoin core development uh
[38:05] where we don't have to um have more
[38:09] developments new developments uh in in
[38:11] the Bitcoin uh code or if we always have
[38:15] to kind of uh get more development going
[38:20] because there is the threat model coming
[38:22] uh maybe with cryptography where we have
[38:25] to upgrade that because uh
[38:28] supercomputers can hack that I don't
[38:30] know what's what's coming I'm I'm
[38:34] unfortunately not the The Tech Guy but
[38:36] but there there might be there's this
[38:40] question in my mind is like um where is
[38:42] Bitcoin development going in like 20 30
[38:45] 40 years down down down the
[38:48] line yeah yeah okay um yeah I think
[38:52] there's going to be things always coming
[38:54] up in terms of like or I mean I'm not
[38:57] sure um but I guess there will be things
[38:59] coming up in the next uh
[39:03] um decades that we will need to address
[39:07] um I think in general that still means
[39:09] that like frequency of like how often we
[39:12] do soft fors um will still go down like
[39:15] will continue to go down I think that's
[39:17] kind of unavoidable and kind of like if
[39:20] if it really would need to go up and we
[39:22] would kind of
[39:23] Chase against um new developments of
[39:27] quantum computers or so every every year
[39:30] or so that would be not not a great
[39:32] future I guess um I mean there's always
[39:35] solutions for that and I think um that
[39:38] like it's all doable but um I hope that
[39:42] um that's that's not something where we
[39:44] headed and and that that we can kind of
[39:46] keep up with development of of such of
[39:49] such things like like quantum computers
[39:52] and um um like I don't know some other
[39:55] cryptographic um new discoveries um new
[39:59] developments
[40:00] um but yeah I think that that there will
[40:03] be things that that will need to be
[40:05] addressed like this is kind of kind of
[40:08] hard to say um honestly like at least
[40:11] like for example quantum computer is
[40:13] something that keeps coming up um and so
[40:15] where where it's not the first time i'
[40:17] I've been asked this question um and so
[40:20] even some people have like kind of
[40:22] aggressively asked me that like how I
[40:24] cannot like already have a plan for that
[40:26] when when the quantum computer comes and
[40:28] like implied that that like Peter te has
[40:32] one in his basement and stuff um
[40:35] so uh I like I I'm I'm in the camp of um
[40:41] believing that it will not like suddenly
[40:44] happen that that a quantum computer
[40:46] appears and and breaks Bitcoin I think
[40:49] first of all I think the the the um the
[40:52] the researchers don't really agree on
[40:54] how quickly we we might get them or if
[40:56] if we will even get them at all but I
[40:58] think um
[41:01] the that this computer is coming um we
[41:05] will we will see it ahead and then we
[41:07] will have some time to react um at least
[41:10] that's that's what I that's what I
[41:12] personally
[41:13] believe um and um yeah so these kinds of
[41:18] things were like this is not the only
[41:20] thing that I would say probably will
[41:22] come up in the next couple of decades
[41:24] but um and they even like um some some
[41:28] bucks that we will need to address that
[41:30] come in in in about a century for
[41:33] example like some Fields break because
[41:35] we're um kind of overstepping some
[41:37] bounds in terms of like account um so
[41:40] there will be some changes that we will
[41:42] need to address and there also for
[41:43] example like a the great consensus
[41:45] cleanup which is addressing some issues
[41:48] in consensus um these are uh attacks
[41:52] that require um very high amount of hash
[41:55] power um in order to be exploited but
[41:57] still um these are things that we should
[41:59] address um simply for security reasons
[42:02] but um yeah I would say still over over
[42:05] time the the amount of changes like
[42:07] really consensus changes um should be
[42:10] going interesting um it it's interesting
[42:14] for you as an uh a c developer um maybe
[42:18] you have a different view on that and I
[42:20] I I frequently ask that question to to
[42:22] to different guests to see what what's
[42:25] going on um what do you think is the
[42:27] biggest vulnerab vulnerability or the
[42:30] biggest threat to the Bitcoin yeah it's
[42:34] it's a hard hard question to just just
[42:36] pick one thing um I mean one thing is
[42:40] that I think with kind of
[42:44] the development of like cbdcs and and
[42:47] stuff like in general people don't like
[42:51] people in the Western World I would say
[42:53] at least in developed countries um often
[42:56] times when when they have a when when
[42:59] things are going well for them they
[43:00] don't really care so much about privacy
[43:02] um and so they
[43:05] may adopt uh something like a cbdc and
[43:09] and I mean they they already adopt now
[43:11] like like apps like PayPal and stuff um
[43:15] so I mean this is not really directly a
[43:18] threat to bitcoin but um that
[43:22] um I guess this is more a threat to
[43:25] humanity right that uh I kind of cash
[43:27] goes away and in general the sense for
[43:30] like privacy being being valuable um
[43:33] goes away and I mean that should mean
[43:36] Bitcoin should see more adoption from
[43:38] the people that like still value this
[43:41] but like maybe maybe we're heading to to
[43:44] a future where where just people say
[43:46] okay like I'm I'm happy with um kind of
[43:48] my my life without privacy um and so I
[43:54] don't yeah I don't really care so much
[43:56] about using Bitcoin and like the cbdc
[43:58] app is working even easier even faster
[44:02] um and um yeah kind of so I would say
[44:07] it's not directly like really something
[44:08] that would destroy Bitcoin but like I
[44:10] guess for in general for Humanity to
[44:12] like not care about the values that that
[44:15] Bitcoin represents I guess is is what
[44:18] I'm what I'm quite worried about um and
[44:22] then I guess um maybe that's a bit uh
[44:25] inspired by recent events but like yeah
[44:27] we we with the ETFs we' have seen very
[44:30] powerful Financial players enter the
[44:33] ecosystem um combined with um kind of
[44:37] the the centralization that we seen in
[44:39] in pools um and so this feel is now like
[44:43] an environment where both of these
[44:45] things could lead to
[44:47] potential um New Capital new new kind of
[44:51] um period where we get to back to
[44:54] something like the um block size for uh
[44:58] where there's powerful um um players
[45:01] that want to kind of yeah make Bitcoin
[45:05] work the way they want it to work um and
[45:08] so I it's really hard to say how that
[45:10] would potentially happen so um the the
[45:15] centralization of of pools like it's
[45:18] very hard to say if that really is
[45:19] something where they want to leverage
[45:21] the power or um how they would play out
[45:24] what what the interests are that is kind
[45:25] of like the a big question Mark right
[45:27] now nobody as as far as I can tell
[45:30] really knows how that is valuable to
[45:33] them when when they have pools that
[45:36] pretend to be other pools but it's
[45:37] really their pool um um and yeah with
[45:42] the with the ETFs um it's very hard to
[45:45] say like how how a big player like um
[45:48] Blackstone for example how they might
[45:51] want to bitcoin to to work the way they
[45:55] would like it um so the these are really
[45:57] more like question marks but I guess so
[46:00] there's not it's not really a tech
[46:01] scenario that I can that I can outline
[46:04] now or that I'm particularly worried
[46:06] about like um when you have billions and
[46:09] billions potentially to spend on on
[46:12] doing it on on kind of like making
[46:15] Bitcoin work the way you want it to work
[46:17] there's many avenues that you can take
[46:18] like you can you can buy a lot of mining
[46:20] power and disrupt the chain you can
[46:24] spend a lot of money on marketing uh you
[46:26] can can bribe people there's so many
[46:28] ways like when you have when you have a
[46:30] lot of money and power then then um yeah
[46:33] there's like an almost endless uh amount
[46:36] of uh ways that you can apply it in
[46:38] order to kind of disrupt the the the
[46:40] ecosystem in general um can be can be
[46:43] more or less technical can be not not
[46:44] technical at all um so yeah then it's
[46:48] really like a question of creativity
[46:50] what you what you what you want to come
[46:52] up with do you feel like the PE to peer
[46:55] nature of Bitcoin kind of gets lost when
[46:58] we have those big players and you
[47:00] mentioned coinbase like almost everyone
[47:03] has a has a coinbase account uh it was
[47:05] also my first account that I opened I
[47:07] don't have it anymore uh it's it's like
[47:11] most people don't have their own Keys
[47:13] most people don't take properly their
[47:15] self custody even less people run their
[47:18] own notes even less people have their
[47:21] own mining rig at home or something like
[47:22] that so most people in Bitcoin just have
[47:25] like a coinbase account or whatever
[47:27] account on an exchange and and that's it
[47:30] and and they never even experience a
[47:33] hardware wallet or something like that
[47:35] so do do you fear that the the
[47:38] peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin kind of
[47:41] gets lost and captured by those
[47:43] financial Giants
[47:45] um I I mean I guess um it's kind of I
[47:51] guess the the same kind of worry that I
[47:54] said like that when are people in
[47:57] general kind of lazy I would say yes
[48:00] with with kind of privacy stuff um um
[48:03] but it's also a bit like the the nature
[48:05] right like if you don't have any worries
[48:06] about privacy if if you've never been
[48:08] unbanked like I mean um you already are
[48:12] busy with lots of other things right so
[48:15] you you probably you don't have to care
[48:18] about it and so it's it's hard for me
[48:19] like to tell somebody who's just like
[48:22] lives a lives a very free life and like
[48:25] wants to invest some money into Bitcoin
[48:27] and then does it over a coinbase account
[48:29] like um yeah I'm not I'm not so
[48:32] religious about this that I that I would
[48:35] like scream at somebody uh for hours to
[48:38] to finally buy a hardware wallet and and
[48:40] do this um I think it's kind of that you
[48:44] we just have to be open kind of and like
[48:46] show people what can happen and I think
[48:48] for example if we looked at FTX or any
[48:51] of the other centralized exchanges like
[48:53] they kind of already make a very good
[48:55] case for why you should have your own
[48:57] Keys like centralization is is is um uh
[49:03] dangerous in in the grand scheme of
[49:05] things but also it's dangerous for for
[49:06] somebody like like this worldfree
[49:09] individual right so um
[49:12] um and then really up to them like do
[49:15] they feel more comfortable with having
[49:16] the money at coinbase or do they feel
[49:18] more comfortable with having it on
[49:20] Hardware wallet um at home um I
[49:23] oftentimes then tell people especially
[49:25] when they have a kind of significant
[49:27] amount like just do 50/50 right like if
[49:30] you if you worry too much that you kind
[49:31] of lose your seat or that you lose your
[49:33] Hardware wallet like the guy that still
[49:36] searching for it in a landfill right
[49:38] like then um but like how much more
[49:42] likely is that then like um coinbase
[49:45] becomes the next FDX um and so then when
[49:48] when when you kind of go this like
[49:50] middle approach like okay like if you do
[49:52] 50/50 like the max you can lose if
[49:54] either one of these events happened is
[49:56] is half your Bitcoin investment um then
[49:59] there's a very important step that they
[50:01] have at least like done like the the
[50:05] gone through the the for many people I
[50:07] would say is a pain still to order a
[50:09] hardware wallet and go through all the
[50:10] steps to to to do it and then um get
[50:13] some money off of The Exchange but at
[50:15] least they have now a hardware wallet
[50:17] and they have used it um and they kind
[50:19] of understand uh what this is about and
[50:22] I think that's that's a good uh I would
[50:24] say it's my preferred way for for the
[50:26] people people that are in this situation
[50:28] to kind of introduce them to this topic
[50:30] and like give them like a practical um
[50:34] like reason to to um to to get off of an
[50:39] exchange um and yeah I
[50:43] think does it really get lost um I mean
[50:48] it's it's hard like you have to
[50:49] experience it right and if you're not
[50:51] really a
[50:52] bitcoiner um then it's hard to
[50:55] experience it I would say like like um
[50:58] there were in in the conference in
[51:00] Nashville there were like 25,000 people
[51:02] or so um but I mean like how many people
[51:05] hold Bitcoin like millions of Americans
[51:08] like have have like some uh Bitcoin at
[51:11] some exchange account probably like not
[51:14] all of them can come to to Nashville and
[51:16] like buy something for Bitcoin there at
[51:18] the at the conference right I mean
[51:20] there's more conferences now there's a
[51:21] lot of conferences I know but not
[51:23] everyone has like a merchant that
[51:25] accepts Bitcoin around the corner
[51:27] and or can go to a conference and and
[51:29] kind of experience using it um so um I
[51:34] mean that's just general adoption like
[51:36] when when the general adoption comes
[51:38] like I think more people will be able to
[51:40] experience it and then maybe they get
[51:41] drawn to this PP use as well and see the
[51:43] beauty of that um uh but I would say
[51:48] like it's it's more about keeping the
[51:50] door open um and the people that
[51:51] actually have a pain like if their bank
[51:54] closes their account for for some stupid
[51:56] reason like they they will come to
[51:58] bitcoin anyway and they they immediately
[52:00] see why they don't want to have a
[52:02] coinbase account and put it on on
[52:04] Hardware wet like there also we just
[52:06] have to leave the door open and make it
[52:08] as easy as possible for these people to
[52:10] to to then onboard to bitcoin um and and
[52:13] then I don't really have worries yeah
[52:15] it's
[52:17] interesting it's just so interesting for
[52:19] me because like I have friends that are
[52:22] in Bitcoin have their own Hardware
[52:24] wallets have all the things that they
[52:27] they they should do um some even like
[52:30] multi and stuff like that um but then
[52:33] there are also friends who are all in
[52:36] Bitcoin understand why it's important
[52:38] from an economic
[52:40] standpoint uh but then they leave it on
[52:43] Exchange and and I'm frustrated because
[52:47] I make a podcast and like I I partner up
[52:49] with like Hardware wallets and then all
[52:52] those things and I promote that uh some
[52:55] I promote basically all services that
[52:57] promote uh um more control of your own
[53:01] keys because I think it's a very
[53:03] important point of of of Bitcoin um so
[53:07] it it sometimes feels like a little bit
[53:09] frustrating as someone that advocates
[53:11] for for not your keys not your coins
[53:14] yeah but uh I guess people uh some
[53:17] people will always stick to to the
[53:19] convenient side and it's important that
[53:21] we have the choice that we have the
[53:23] choice to be self Sovereign uh and and
[53:27] maybe there are coming more and more
[53:29] events in the future that people and the
[53:31] race learn from from that and but yeah
[53:34] FDX was a pretty good one like for me
[53:36] it's like if you didn't learn from FDX
[53:38] Celsius and all the other things what
[53:41] what more should that come like coinbase
[53:43] getting hacked and all Bitcoins uh
[53:45] stolen from coinbase that would be a
[53:47] major thing uh but honestly I I I I
[53:51] would even I would even say it's it's a
[53:53] long-term healthy thing if coinbase gets
[53:55] hacked like it's it's a a massive thing
[53:57] that will probably tank the Bitcoin
[53:59] price shortterm massively um I would
[54:02] pick up all of the the cheap s that I
[54:05] possibly can and long term maybe it's
[54:08] it's that major event that has to happen
[54:11] that people wake up to self custody it's
[54:13] I don't know may maybe we need some
[54:16] catastrophe like uh coin B going down uh
[54:20] would also be interesting because now
[54:22] they also hold the the the ETFs uh and
[54:25] and and those things but yeah it's
[54:28] interesting to think about those things
[54:30] but as an other topic as we also also
[54:33] discussed before because we already at
[54:34] the one hour mark it's amazing how the
[54:36] time flies by um you're working at the
[54:39] human rights Foundation also um first of
[54:43] all
[54:44] like why and what has Bitcoin to do with
[54:47] human rights from your perspective so I
[54:49] mean first of all I have to clarify I I
[54:52] personally don't work for the human
[54:53] rights Foundation I have a fellowship
[54:55] from the human rights Foundation um so
[54:59] um that I basically I mentioned it
[55:01] previously and we we'll go into into the
[55:03] details um bit later probably but um
[55:06] Caesar cross input sign aggregation is
[55:08] is a a potential softwalk uh for the
[55:11] Bitcoin protocol and um I did some work
[55:15] on that and um at the same time I had
[55:17] already started working on this um hrf
[55:21] announced the fellowship uh for this
[55:23] particular topic um and so we basically
[55:26] came together immediately and they
[55:29] awarded me this Fellowship U for which
[55:32] um primarily so far what you can see of
[55:34] it is a website um so this um Cesar
[55:37] research.org um is a website where I've
[55:41] written all that is basically um
[55:44] available about cesa at the moment um
[55:47] hopefully in a adjustable way even for
[55:50] people that are um a bit newer to to
[55:52] protocol um development
[55:56] and so this is basically how the
[55:59] connection came to hrf and then um now
[56:02] I'm working with hrf for on on this
[56:04] topic of of cesa and um um for example
[56:09] um through hrf um I uh give talks on
[56:13] this topic and kind of promote the topic
[56:16] at conferences um to put it more in kind
[56:19] of the public eye and um yeah get let
[56:22] more people know what the what cesa
[56:25] actually is
[56:27] um just so that yeah people actually
[56:29] understand its benefits and so but like
[56:31] back to your question um I uh I cannot
[56:36] really speak for HF because I don't
[56:38] really have a great overview I think
[56:39] over all of the things they are doing um
[56:43] but uh like I think the reason why hrf
[56:46] is very interested in Bitcoin is similar
[56:49] to what I mentioned previously uh what
[56:52] what kind of got me into Bitcoin and I
[56:53] think why it's also very good uh match
[56:55] between us
[56:56] um is that um when When people's uh
[57:01] rights are are in danger when they are
[57:03] suppressed um uh the um all of these all
[57:07] of these uh things that kind of um are
[57:10] available to to the state in general
[57:12] like for example freezing bank accounts
[57:15] um seizing assets um uh that is
[57:18] something that people can opt out uh
[57:20] when they use Bitcoin um and that's why
[57:23] Bitcoin is very very great tool for
[57:25] people that are
[57:26] um doing stuff that in in their
[57:29] respective jurisdiction is illegal but
[57:32] maybe for us it's not illegal like this
[57:34] always depend depends on where you are
[57:36] right what what is really is illegal and
[57:38] and what what the state doesn't like to
[57:39] see um and so um Bitcoin is a very um is
[57:45] a very um important tool for this and um
[57:48] hrf particularly I think Alex letin um
[57:52] is the one who who started this um
[57:54] understood a couple of years of um what
[57:58] how valuable Bitcoin is as a tool um and
[58:01] they're promoting this so they are
[58:02] educating um activists in in the use of
[58:06] Bitcoin um some people for example that
[58:08] I've met is from the team of navali um
[58:13] an anti-corruption Foundation um they
[58:16] have been accepting Bitcoin for several
[58:18] years now um since navali bank accounts
[58:22] were frozen in Russia um and um yeah I
[58:25] don't have all of the details what what
[58:27] that kind of triggered them to start um
[58:30] but for them Bitcoin is a very important
[58:32] tool and and there many other activists
[58:34] that are getting support from hrf uh to
[58:37] to use the tool and hrf is really yeah
[58:40] kind of kind of promoting Bitcoin as a
[58:43] use for people that really need
[58:45] it um
[58:48] yeah I I just saw the the website of of
[58:51] of Tesa is really cool green and very
[58:54] simple uh in in the design I like I like
[58:58] that if I'm on the right one t
[59:00] research.org I think I'm on the right
[59:02] it's it's dark and green yeah yeah
[59:05] you're on the right one yeah I love the
[59:07] the focus on the
[59:09] content
[59:11] czys yeah I mean I I also don't like to
[59:15] do the designs but also I think it's
[59:17] very important to focus on the content
[59:19] yeah absolutely so um as you said it
[59:23] before what is caesa and you're working
[59:26] on that and and what's the in also
[59:29] involvement with the human rights
[59:31] Foundation yeah so cesa um stands for
[59:35] cross input signature aggregation and um
[59:39] if you remember the capoot soft for as
[59:43] part of um Tapo we also got a new
[59:46] signature type and that is schnor
[59:48] signatures and schnor signatures are um
[59:52] linear um so like it's it's a
[59:56] complicated uh mathematical explanation
[59:58] so I would just just keep it at that so
[60:00] the schor signatures are actually a bit
[60:02] simpler than the signatures we had
[60:04] previously um and that means you can um
[60:07] aggregate them together so you can have
[60:10] um one signature that that signs certain
[60:14] message and then you can also have a
[60:15] second uh signature that signs a second
[60:18] message and then you can basically add
[60:21] these two signatures together so you
[60:22] only have one signature um and then you
[60:24] can still validate that both of these
[60:27] signatures sign the the these two
[60:29] messages so this is a um obvious why um
[60:36] so I mean you can say you have to say
[60:38] that these signatures are then also
[60:40] smaller so potentially these two
[60:42] signatures are the same size as one
[60:44] signature previously so um I guess if
[60:47] you understand how Bitcoin transactions
[60:49] work and how why you pay fees and stuff
[60:52] like you can see where this is going um
[60:54] this is possible to do this on
[60:56] transactions as well um and so the The
[61:00] Proposal um in in very broad Strokes is
[61:04] that for transactions we could aggregate
[61:06] the signatures that are in a transaction
[61:09] so um often times or usually you have
[61:12] for each input one signature at least so
[61:15] let's say you have a transaction with
[61:17] three um inputs and you have three
[61:19] signatures to sign these inputs um then
[61:21] you could aggregate them to just have
[61:23] one signature and then you have a
[61:25] smaller transaction ction and so that
[61:26] means you have to pay less fees um
[61:29] because yeah you just take up less space
[61:31] in the block um so that's that's just
[61:34] generally the basic idea um uh by the
[61:38] way this aggregation is also what is
[61:42] being used um or this is similar to
[61:44] what's being used in multis um it's just
[61:47] that there the aggregation is happening
[61:49] previously so you aggregate the keys as
[61:51] well um so if you think of music or so
[61:56] oftentimes people um kind of throw these
[61:59] things together or or have a hard time
[62:01] keeping them apart with music when you
[62:04] have a when you have a multis in tap rot
[62:07] you aggregate the keys first and then
[62:10] later you also have just one signature
[62:12] but because you have to aggregate the
[62:13] keys first there's just one input and
[62:16] one out one signature so there's not
[62:19] really something that has to be changed
[62:22] on the transaction side because on the
[62:24] transaction side in in the what you see
[62:26] in the block hasn't changed so this is
[62:29] why why this is um
[62:31] different um basically the change if if
[62:34] I try to make it as simple as possible
[62:36] like a transaction we we we would want
[62:38] to have a new type of transaction where
[62:40] it doesn't matter how many inputs it has
[62:43] uh it can just have one signature um
[62:47] would would that allow um we had I think
[62:51] like a few months back with Wicked an
[62:53] in-depth talk about utxo management
[62:57] uh and how you should avoid having too
[63:00] small of utxos because then they they
[63:02] might be dust in in the future uh
[63:05] because the transaction fees outsize the
[63:07] the actual value so you would have to
[63:09] pay more uh um more to move the Bitcoin
[63:14] than the Bitcoin are actually Worth or
[63:16] the Sates are actually worth would that
[63:18] also mean that um combining maybe um
[63:22] bigger ones with smaller ones uh where
[63:25] the
[63:26] where uh the the like let's call it dust
[63:29] when it's like uh the the transaction
[63:31] fee is higher than the the actual value
[63:34] of the Sates there um combining more of
[63:37] those with the this proposal would that
[63:40] then unlock them again and make utex o
[63:43] management better in in that regard um I
[63:46] mean unlocking dust uh that like only
[63:50] very limited amount of of dust and so I
[63:54] would say yes potentially um but I mean
[63:58] uh if if they're really that that Dusty
[64:01] then I I think this this won't be like
[64:04] it it won't be that big of Leverage but
[64:06] definitely what I can say is yeah um the
[64:09] more inputs like the more inputs that
[64:12] are in transaction the the better the
[64:13] savings are um of course and it means
[64:16] like what what you what you are saying
[64:18] kind of like these consolidation
[64:20] transactions so let's say you have a lot
[64:21] of
[64:22] small small utex OES um and um currently
[64:26] we have a nice low fee environment um
[64:29] you say like okay I um I may not be able
[64:32] to spend this when when when the next
[64:34] wave comes and like the the fees are up
[64:37] 10x or 100x so I want to consolidate
[64:39] them um then this would make this
[64:42] consolidation uh a lot cheaper um that's
[64:45] interesting of course for people that
[64:46] like get donations for example or um
[64:49] also interesting for for any kind of
[64:51] business um that accepts payment for not
[64:54] super large Goods
[64:56] um like um company like bitre for
[64:59] example um still gets a lot of onchain
[65:02] um payments exchanges of course get uh
[65:05] get a lot of these um and regular do
[65:07] these consolidation transactions so for
[65:11] them uh definitely this is this is a big
[65:14] um lever in terms of savings um but uh
[65:18] this is not the like I would say the the
[65:20] Blockbuster use case and also of course
[65:22] not not the kind of the reason why hrf
[65:24] is interested in in this technology um
[65:27] and there's another transaction type on
[65:29] the network where there's a lot of
[65:31] inputs and that's coin joints um and
[65:34] coin joints are a privacy tool I'm not
[65:37] sure how much you have discussed it if I
[65:39] should go into detail what a coin join
[65:41] is um in general maybe a little bit we
[65:45] discussed it on one podcast episode so
[65:47] the chances that people don't know about
[65:50] it that high uh but yeah maybe just like
[65:53] quickly what an overview of what the
[65:54] coin train is
[65:56] yeah so just very high level view conon
[65:59] is an interactive um way of of building
[66:03] transactions together so a lot of people
[66:05] come together um and all of them have
[66:08] utxo let's say um and they basically
[66:12] combine this UT these utxos uh in a safe
[66:15] way into one transaction where um all of
[66:18] them like very simply like imagine all
[66:21] of them have a control one input um and
[66:24] then at the end they also get out one um
[66:26] output um and so you then um you don't
[66:32] lose control of your funds but it's kind
[66:34] of scrambled so um before maybe since
[66:37] you um finally made the step to get out
[66:40] of coinbase uh let's say you withdrew
[66:43] your uh 0.1 Bitcoin that you saved over
[66:45] time um and uh but then like since you
[66:50] it's clear to anyone on the network like
[66:52] chalis or so can easily see okay this
[66:54] came out of coin base coinbase has your
[66:57] passport and and everything um and so
[67:00] it's still clear that this utxo is
[67:03] controlled by you um is owned by you
[67:06] very likely or if not then maybe you
[67:08] withdrawn to to your friend's address or
[67:10] whatever um but but it's still
[67:12] Associated to you in in in the kind of
[67:14] the view um of the blockchain like bit
[67:16] Bitcoin is not Anonymous it's
[67:18] pseudonymous um and so this this
[67:20] transaction is still uh basically your
[67:23] pseudonym where where the funds are um
[67:25] and so then you can use a coin join to
[67:27] send it through this collaborative
[67:29] transaction where 100 other people for
[67:31] example are participating as well and so
[67:33] then afterwards there's a 100 um uh
[67:36] addresses where potentially it could be
[67:38] yours um and so then you have uh an
[67:41] anonymity set of 100 that you're hiding
[67:44] uh inside um and then you can also do
[67:46] this over several rounds um and then um
[67:49] you can also split these funds like
[67:51] there there um there are certain
[67:53] protocols to this um that both make it
[67:56] safe and that also um kind of make sure
[68:00] that um it's not easy to analyze what
[68:03] with with a certain degree of of
[68:05] likelihood that you own certain funds so
[68:09] you can do this for example before then
[68:11] you you finally put your money onto Co
[68:14] storage um and then you have basically
[68:18] um Anonymous Bitcoin again and it's not
[68:22] associated with you in person and um so
[68:25] this is important because it um it
[68:29] allows people that are really for them
[68:31] for who is very important to use Bitcoin
[68:34] uh not just because they are unbanked
[68:36] but also because they could potentially
[68:38] be targeted um uh in in in their in
[68:43] their country politically or where where
[68:45] they are um so it's not just about like
[68:49] using Bitcoin um uh because you don't
[68:53] have bank account but also like you need
[68:55] to be be able to use it anonymously and
[68:57] um coin join allows that um but um often
[69:01] times coin join comes with a certain
[69:03] overhead in terms of like you need to
[69:05] get your money into a wallet that um
[69:07] allows to participate in coin joins um
[69:10] and uh then like I mean this is not the
[69:14] case anymore like there's been quite a
[69:15] bit of uh turmoil in in the coin join uh
[69:19] wallet space because the samurai wallet
[69:22] uh was um people were um
[69:25] apprehended um I'm not sure if they're
[69:28] currently in jail but they are
[69:29] definitely
[69:31] um there's definitely cour coming up in
[69:34] a couple of months I think um and so um
[69:38] but yeah there there's a certain
[69:40] overhead um and so when but when we say
[69:43] that with caesa um transactions that
[69:46] have a lot of input become cheaper um
[69:49] then also participating in coin joints
[69:50] becomes cheaper um and what Cesar
[69:54] actually even
[69:56] is that it actually makes going through
[69:59] a coin join um ignoring a lot of the
[70:02] details but going through coin join can
[70:04] potentially be cheaper for you than like
[70:07] just sending your own transaction so
[70:09] let's say you have your point1 Bitcoin
[70:10] but you also want to buy a conference
[70:13] ticket with that um conference gives you
[70:15] 10% discount on on on purchases with
[70:18] Bitcoin and in general you want to
[70:20] finally be part of the P2P uh way of
[70:23] using Bitcoin right um so then when when
[70:26] you when you do this payment you can
[70:27] either send your send one transaction
[70:29] with uh one input to outputs uh um but
[70:34] you can also send it through a coin join
[70:37] um and that can potentially be cheaper
[70:39] for you um than just making your own
[70:41] transaction um just because you
[70:43] participate in this uh big transaction
[70:46] where um all of the um signatures are
[70:50] collapsed and you just pay for one
[70:52] signature like all of the people pay for
[70:54] one signature but versus when when you
[70:56] do your own transactions you pay a loan
[70:58] for for U2 for U one signature what's
[71:01] also then interesting is that when when
[71:03] you save with participating coin joints
[71:05] you also get uh plausible deniability um
[71:09] it it doesn't just make it um
[71:12] interesting for people to use a more
[71:14] private to use Bitcoin in a more private
[71:16] way but um you since you also save um
[71:20] money doing it um when somebody like
[71:23] kind of right now there's kind of always
[71:25] this like um thing like okay like I mean
[71:29] in general Bitcoin is just used by
[71:30] criminals but especially when you use
[71:33] coin join in order to um be more private
[71:36] then definitely you must be a criminal
[71:37] right but uh we can like get away from
[71:40] that a bit more when we say okay like
[71:43] coin joints are actually a way to use
[71:45] Bitcoin cheaper uh it's not just more
[71:48] private but it's also cheaper um and so
[71:50] that that is also a very nice effect um
[71:53] that that yeah would be great
[71:56] and that's an interesting argument never
[71:58] heard because like uh without that the
[72:01] only only argument for doing a coin join
[72:04] is for uh um yeah basically for privacy
[72:09] purposes and and then the state is like
[72:11] yeah you you you want to hide something
[72:13] from me you're a criminal uh basically I
[72:15] don't agree with that uh uh opinion but
[72:19] it is uh it is what they are thinking
[72:22] and then if you're saying like oh no I
[72:24] just want to save fees like it's it's
[72:27] hard so like that that could have been
[72:29] an interesting uh argument for for that
[72:32] and it's also really could could really
[72:34] enhance privacy for people that want to
[72:36] have more privacy and do those contro
[72:39] it's really interesting thank you um now
[72:42] last question before we come to the end
[72:44] routine the every guest gets what can we
[72:47] learn from you besides all the things
[72:50] that we already talked
[72:52] about um I mean I think
[72:55] I I'm working on bitcoin core and we
[72:57] talked a bit about uh kind of like what
[73:00] it's like to to work on on bitcoin core
[73:03] and um I guess I gave some some insights
[73:07] in into that world already um but in
[73:11] general I would just say that for a lot
[73:14] of people Bitcoin cor is kind of this
[73:15] this black box that they have a hard
[73:17] time understanding or like feel like
[73:19] it's it's uh something that they like
[73:23] they they just ignore because there's no
[73:25] point in in in uh in getting involved or
[73:29] even just following it being able to
[73:31] understand what is going on there um and
[73:34] um I would say like if you make um some
[73:38] effort to like go to places for example
[73:42] like read um what an IRC meeting is um
[73:46] and uh read kind of the meeting notes
[73:49] and um subscribe to to the optech
[73:52] newsletter where Bitcoin core Pro
[73:54] requests are uh mentioned and and
[73:57] explained um it is something that I
[74:00] think uh everyone can can go through
[74:02] even if you're not technical um and I
[74:05] think it would allow you to learn um a
[74:08] lot about what the protocol is like and
[74:11] kind of what the things that are going
[74:12] on there um and so I would I would
[74:15] really invite everyone to to kind of
[74:17] like not not see this as something that
[74:18] you cannot do like it it definitely is
[74:21] going to take some time to to kind of
[74:23] get used to it and like kind of get like
[74:24] a basic understanding of what things are
[74:27] that are being talked about um but it's
[74:30] not something that you can uh that that
[74:32] you that you should be scared of um I
[74:35] would say um and um also something that
[74:39] I would recommend if your if that's like
[74:42] available to you um the Meetup format
[74:45] Socratic seminar um also often kind of
[74:48] like under the name of BFS um if that's
[74:51] available in your city like I I host it
[74:54] in in my city City in Berlin um uh but
[74:57] there's they are available all over the
[74:59] world and in in Germany for example
[75:01] there's also German speaking one that
[75:03] are doing it remotely over a jitsy
[75:05] server um that is a very interesting uh
[75:09] format to learn about stuff that is
[75:11] going on in in the Bitcoin space
[75:13] especially if it's a bit more technical
[75:15] um and so this is also something where
[75:18] maybe if you come there the first time
[75:19] it will seem like totally overwhelming
[75:22] and you might not understand anything um
[75:24] but but there's also my recommendation
[75:26] just stick with it a bit and um just
[75:29] yeah you will you will already learn a
[75:31] lot by of Osmosis basically just just
[75:34] just listening just just uh kind of like
[75:38] maybe afterwards you you search for some
[75:40] stuff later you read some stuff um
[75:42] afterwards um and then within like going
[75:45] there three or four times you will start
[75:47] to see like you hear some things again
[75:49] that you heard before um you start to
[75:51] understand things a bit better U maybe
[75:53] you ask your first question
[75:55] um and um so yeah I would I'd like to
[75:59] invite everyone when when you have a
[76:01] possibility to go to a bit so critic
[76:03] seminar um please do that that's that's
[76:06] also very amazing um learning
[76:08] opportunity really cool uh I think
[76:11] learning about Bitcoin uh in general no
[76:14] matter what aspect especially also the
[76:16] technical things is so important
[76:18] especially as we are so early into the
[76:21] game so uh uh thanks for the for the for
[76:24] the um uh tip um now we have the end
[76:27] routine where the previous guest is
[76:29] asking a question for the next guest
[76:30] without knowing who the next guest
[76:32] actually is uh and your question from
[76:34] the previous guest is an interesting one
[76:35] it gets in the debate store of value
[76:38] versus medium of exchange um uh and he
[76:42] asks do you think we will first
[76:44] integrate more uh um Financial products
[76:48] for store of value like Bitcoin bonds uh
[76:51] ETFs and stuff like that before we come
[76:53] to uh
[76:55] a higher adoption of medium of exchange
[76:59] so like the question is like um when
[77:02] when do we start finding more adoption
[77:05] of the medium exchange use case I mean
[77:07] we touch a little bit on it with uh the
[77:09] lightning um with the lightning
[77:12] discussion um where do you see the
[77:14] adoption of Medi exchange where do you
[77:16] see the adoption with with store value
[77:18] from Bitcoin especially the the the
[77:20] whole financial system coming now in
[77:23] with with uh the the to of value aspect
[77:25] and ETFs and maybe Bitcoin bonds and
[77:29] Nations buying Bitcoin and all those
[77:30] things uh I I would
[77:33] say like to me it's a it's a bit um hard
[77:38] to answer I guess it's because I think
[77:41] the the store value use case to me is
[77:44] already kind of at the maximum I would
[77:47] say I mean like more there can always be
[77:49] more people doing it um but I feel like
[77:51] everyone who wants to do it can do it
[77:53] and there's not really it doesn't feel
[77:55] like to me like there's many ways of
[77:57] keeping people from it like you you if
[78:00] you buy an ETF or if you get a coinbase
[78:02] account or if you if you buy uh if you
[78:05] buy a hardware wallet uh like these are
[78:08] things that are open to people and once
[78:09] you have made the decision to do it I
[78:11] think you can you have all of these
[78:13] choices and you can you can do it right
[78:15] away so I
[78:17] mean it's um I would say there's not
[78:20] really that much to do I mean like there
[78:22] can always be more people doing it like
[78:24] more people can buy it maybe you have an
[78:26] uncle that still hasn't uh had any
[78:28] Bitcoin right but um to me I feel like
[78:32] there isn't really much to be um to be
[78:37] discovered in in that sense whereas on
[78:39] on the other side on the PTP side of of
[78:42] medium exchange I think like that's
[78:44] where I'm I'm hoping and I guess that's
[78:46] my answer I'm going with medium of
[78:48] exchange I basically I hope that we see
[78:51] more availability there that we see more
[78:53] merchants um using uh Bitcoin and
[78:57] accepting Bitcoin payments um and and
[79:00] kind of seeing this um as a as a way of
[79:04] transacting I think there's there's like
[79:06] we've already had BTC pay server many
[79:09] years ago and that already made things
[79:11] great but there's also a lot of other um
[79:14] tools available now that that um and and
[79:18] and services that make this easier for
[79:20] you um like um point of sale um
[79:24] computers uh apps on the phone Etc um
[79:28] there so there's really so much choice
[79:30] that really um yeah I'm I I'm hoping to
[79:34] see this also because um it's just fun
[79:36] to to pay for a beer at a bar I'm like
[79:39] we we do this uh at our Meetup for
[79:41] example as well and we've been doing
[79:43] this for a very long time um it's
[79:47] something where it's still kind of
[79:49] strange to me when I come somewhere else
[79:51] and there's like a kind of like a
[79:53] conference or or something kind of
[79:55] Meetup or so um where it's about Bitcoin
[79:57] but then they don't accept Bitcoin
[79:59] payments in as payment for example like
[80:02] um or for example like I was at a big
[80:05] conference um where people told me like
[80:09] yeah we do offer Bitcoin payments but
[80:11] really most people here don't really
[80:13] want to spend their Bitcoin um so this
[80:15] is something also where yeah this kind
[80:18] of strange to me because it was always
[80:19] kind of part of it for me um uh but yeah
[80:24] I I guess I'm I'm hoping for for that to
[80:26] become more normal than or become as
[80:29] normal for other people as it is to me
[80:31] yeah I think a big part of why people
[80:33] don't want to spend it uh because if
[80:37] they want to stay on the lawful side
[80:40] they have to uh pay capital gains tax on
[80:43] it uh that's that's a I think a major
[80:46] thing I think I myself would spend it
[80:50] even more when when there would not be
[80:52] tax implications not only because like
[80:54] costs more than but also the hustle of
[80:58] documenting all that all that crap is
[81:02] it's like I don't want to document so
[81:04] much so it's I think it's in when you're
[81:07] living in a state where there is um
[81:10] capital gain stxs on bitcoin it's easier
[81:13] to just huddle on and and spend your
[81:15] feat income if you have feat income if
[81:17] you have only Bitcoin income if you're
[81:19] one of the the the lucky people that are
[81:22] already on a Bitcoin standard also from
[81:24] earning perspective uh then I guess it's
[81:27] uh more interesting then it's also uh
[81:30] CLE gain dexs could be could be weird um
[81:33] but yeah I would love to live on a
[81:35] Bitcoin standard now I would love to
[81:36] just switch because I'm already 100% in
[81:39] Bitcoin I only use field to PL to to do
[81:43] all the things uh outside of the Bitcoin
[81:46] world uh but my one of my sponsors in
[81:48] the podcast already pays me in Bitcoin
[81:51] uh and I try to to pay a little bit with
[81:55] with Bitcoin here and there uh but it's
[81:57] it's it's a hustle with with the taxes
[81:59] if you really want to stay lawful and I
[82:01] try to stay as lawful as possible um and
[82:05] I think that's a major major Catalyst if
[82:08] no Capal against that no capital gains
[82:11] taxes on on bitcoin exist yeah perfect
[82:13] then uh let's uh let's wrap it up um
[82:17] before I let you go before I can let you
[82:18] go um where can people uh find you is
[82:21] there any place on email or where where
[82:24] people can can reach out to you or
[82:25] Twitter yeah Twitter is fine um you can
[82:30] just uh there engage with me that's
[82:32] that's where we engaged as well the
[82:33] first time right so yeah I'm I'm
[82:36] available on Twitter um I think that's
[82:38] that's probably the easiest way to reach
[82:40] me perfect then thank you so much Fabian
[82:42] for for being on also thank you for
