[00:00] the sky the limit things could get
[00:01] pretty crazy if all of these promises do
[00:03] come to fruition in terms of a strategic
[00:05] Bitcoin Reserve you have a growing list
[00:08] of states that have already put forth
[00:09] bills to accumulate Bitcoin for their
[00:12] state treasury to think that there would
[00:13] be like legitimate discussions of the US
[00:16] government purchasing Bitcoin you know
[00:18] people would laugh you out of the room
[00:19] if you said that two years ago Bitcoin
[00:20] is really the most like riskof
[00:22] allocation you could possibly have it's
[00:24] it's outside money it's transparent
[00:26] monetary policy immutable all these
[00:28] things makes it a risk-off asset given
[00:30] the amazing year that these ETFs had in
[00:32] terms of inflows last year it could be
[00:34] even magnitudes larger this year as all
[00:36] of these warehouses and and financial
[00:38] firms actually allow their underlying
[00:40] clients to to get access to these
[00:42] [Music]
[00:46] things what do you think happens in 2095
[00:49] because there's so much happening
[00:50] there's so much in store for 2095 what
[00:53] are you kind of expecting it's a wild
[00:55] it's a wild timeline we're in right like
[00:57] it's uh you know there was a few sort of
[01:00] pivotal turning points over the past 12
[01:03] months that allowed us to be on this
[01:05] current timeline um and you know it's
[01:09] just it's pretty amazing to to look at
[01:11] where we are right now and just think
[01:14] back even a year or two years ago and to
[01:17] think that there would be like
[01:18] legitimate discussions of the US
[01:21] government perhaps purchasing Bitcoin um
[01:24] you know people would laugh you out of
[01:26] the room if you said that two years ago
[01:28] um and now that's very much in the
[01:31] Zeitgeist uh and legitimately being
[01:33] considered and so it's you know it's
[01:36] it's hard to say what happens this year
[01:38] to be totally honest you know I
[01:40] I usually refrain from making specific
[01:44] uh price predictions but you know up is
[01:47] generally my My Vibe and my sense at
[01:50] this point like I think that's I don't
[01:52] see how we don't continue to go up from
[01:53] here uh I also think you know if you
[01:57] look at the ET the success of the ETFs
[01:59] last year
[02:00] was astounding like the most successful
[02:02] Financial products ever launched um but
[02:06] with the huge caveat or asterisk that
[02:08] like most of the wirehouses and
[02:10] traditional Financial firms have still
[02:12] not even turned on support for these
[02:14] ETFs um and so I think that that could
[02:17] be something this year that catches
[02:18] people off guard that you know even
[02:21] given the amazing year that these ETFs
[02:23] had in terms of inflows last year it
[02:25] could be even uh you know magnitudes
[02:27] larger this year as all of these uh
[02:30] wirehouses and and financial firms
[02:32] actually allow their underlying clients
[02:34] to to get access to these things um so
[02:37] that that's one component and then
[02:38] obviously this you know the sort of
[02:41] overarching nation state game theory
[02:43] that appears to be playing out um you
[02:45] know there's obviously been tons of
[02:47] rumors about you know countries exxus
[02:51] that may already be
[02:53] accumulating uh Bitcoin on their
[02:55] treasuries or even mining Bitcoin um
[02:59] that seems likely in my mind just from
[03:01] again A Game Theory perspective of if
[03:03] the United States is beginning to to
[03:05] talk about this idea it would make sense
[03:07] to to try to front them front run them a
[03:09] little bit um and so yeah super excited
[03:12] about this year and just you know I
[03:14] think the sky the limit to some to some
[03:17] extent I think things could get pretty
[03:18] crazy if if you know all these uh
[03:21] promises do come to fruition in terms of
[03:24] a strategic Bitcoin reserve and you know
[03:27] I think one thing that you know most
[03:28] people aren't thinking about at least if
[03:29] you're like you know on the outside of
[03:31] the space or or on the on the periphery
[03:33] of Bitcoin is like you've probably heard
[03:35] about the Str strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[03:37] you've heard some of Trump's comments
[03:39] but what's going less uh less reported
[03:43] or under reported is the same thing is
[03:46] happening at the state level um and so I
[03:49] think it's much more likely that we
[03:50] actually get uh you know state level
[03:53] legislation for Bitcoin reserves um I
[03:56] think that's even more likely than at
[03:58] the federal level honestly um and so you
[04:00] have a growing list of states that have
[04:03] already put forth uh bills to accumulate
[04:07] Bitcoin for their their state treasury
[04:09] um some of those being some of the
[04:11] largest states uh like Texas which I
[04:13] believe is hopefully I'm getting this
[04:15] right but it's like the eth eth or 12th
[04:18] I don't know why those two numbers are
[04:19] coming to mind but it's you know roughly
[04:21] a top 10 uh GDP state if you know if
[04:25] Texas were its own country uh that's how
[04:28] large the GDP of Texas is um so that's I
[04:31] think a a you know one element that
[04:33] people are under appreciating about all
[04:36] of this talk around you know finally
[04:38] some recognition that like Bitcoin is
[04:40] this strategic asset like it is the
[04:42] greatest store of value we've ever seen
[04:43] so yeah maybe maybe you should
[04:45] accumulate some of it for your treasury
[04:47] um so that's I think some of the most
[04:49] exciting things as we as we head into
[04:50] this year but like I said at the
[04:52] beginning like it is somewhat surreal to
[04:55] to look around and see where we are
[04:57] right now in this moment and sort of uh
[05:00] rewind a couple years and just you know
[05:02] think about how different uh sort of the
[05:04] narratives and and just the general
[05:05] Zeitgeist was at that time absolutely
[05:09] and it's interesting uh when we look at
[05:12] the the the Strategic bin Reserve I
[05:15] thought it was not likely just a few
[05:17] months ago uh like literally like four
[05:20] months ago I was like ah n that that
[05:22] that's not going to happen this cycle
[05:24] and now I'm completely flipped I'm like
[05:26] it it wouldn't surprise me actually if
[05:29] we had like end of Q2 and we still have
[05:32] nothing of like official news like
[05:34] that's almost would surprise me now a
[05:37] lot then you can
[05:39] see I I agree just in the sense that you
[05:43] know just knowing kind of uh you know
[05:45] who who the person and the man that
[05:47] Donald Trump is now that he and his team
[05:50] the people around him have signaled
[05:52] their intent to do this um there will be
[05:56] at least you know some form of backlash
[05:59] if these things don't happen and whether
[06:01] that's warranted or not I think is
[06:02] another question but it's it's just the
[06:04] reality of I don't think Trump himself
[06:07] wants to be seen in or you know
[06:09] perceived in a light where he said
[06:12] something to this cohort of Voters who
[06:14] ended up voting for him um and he
[06:16] doesn't follow through on that plan like
[06:18] I I think you know even just the the
[06:20] notion of like you know if he doesn't
[06:22] free Ross on day one like I think that's
[06:26] I think that'll be um you know a strong
[06:30] signal that maybe you know we we've
[06:32] gotten a little overhyped in this
[06:34] narrative around this new Administration
[06:35] if he doesn't actually follow through on
[06:37] that one because that's there's like
[06:39] really no political backlash that he
[06:41] would receive from doing that um it
[06:43] seems pretty consensus across the board
[06:45] that that is is something that should
[06:47] occur um and he made the promise so it's
[06:50] it's a very sort of easy win for him and
[06:52] it's also something that he promised and
[06:54] so if he does follow through with that
[06:55] on day one you know there's been reports
[06:57] this week that there's roughly executive
[07:00] orders that he's going to sign on Monday
[07:02] I don't know when this podcast is coming
[07:03] out but we're recording it on on the
[07:05] 17th so inauguration days is on Monday
[07:09] but yeah there's there's been reports
[07:10] that you know he's he's planning on
[07:11] signing a number of of executive orders
[07:14] and so I expect Ross being freed to be
[07:16] in there and I think it's likely to your
[07:19] point you know even if you just look at
[07:21] like poly Market or uh other betting
[07:23] Market odds that's just been the the
[07:25] likelihood of an s spr or some executive
[07:28] order to the effect of you know doing
[07:30] something with Bitcoin uh in as a
[07:33] strategic Reserve asset um that
[07:36] probability has been inching up over the
[07:38] past several weeks I think it's now like
[07:39] 65% on poly Market or something like
[07:42] that um the interesting thing about
[07:44] those betting markets though is like
[07:46] well how do you define I don't know
[07:48] exactly how they're defining spr right
[07:51] because there could be a number of
[07:53] different flavors of what a piece of
[07:55] legislation looks like whether it's an
[07:57] actual piece of legislation that goes
[07:58] through Congress or it's just an
[08:00] executive order on day one so there's a
[08:02] bunch of different sort of uh variations
[08:04] of what that could look like are they
[08:05] just holding the existing Bitcoin are
[08:07] they actually committing to buying uh
[08:09] incremental Bitcoin is a pretty big
[08:11] distinction in terms of I think like how
[08:14] people were pce will perceive it that
[08:16] said I think any any movement in that
[08:19] direction that signals again he's
[08:20] following through on the these initial
[08:22] promises and what he campaigned on I
[08:24] think will be extremely bullish um for
[08:27] for sort of near-term price movement um
[08:30] but yeah it's very very exciting
[08:31] absolutely and it's it's also
[08:33] interesting because it is um if it
[08:36] doesn't change uh legislation a in a big
[08:39] way it's probably his last turn so his
[08:42] last four years uh and uh he's
[08:45] also how old is he like 70 something
[08:48] like that or like he's almost 80 yeah he
[08:51] pretty old he's so it it probably will
[08:55] be his his last things that he he does
[08:58] in in a big way in public I think maybe
[09:01] he surprises us I don't know um so it's
[09:04] also something where like okay this last
[09:06] four years it's kind of building or
[09:09] ruining his legacy uh this is where it's
[09:11] like he he can make a lot of things
[09:14] where he's known in in in 50 years as as
[09:17] that kind of President and I think it is
[09:20] a little bit in his mind of like okay
[09:22] Bitcoin might be something there's so
[09:24] many clever people around me talking
[09:26] about it um if I'm the first president
[09:29] pres to to embrace that I will be the
[09:32] first president to embrace Bitcoin and
[09:35] this will be for something forever so I
[09:37] think there's some Legacy aspect to it
[09:40] where he cares about that things
[09:42] absolutely there's a couple elements
[09:44] there to pull on it's one it's just the
[09:48] reality of who he's surrounded himself
[09:50] with so this isn't just coming from him
[09:51] it's not just his own crafted narrative
[09:54] it's his family it's his confidants it's
[09:56] people he's surrounded himself with that
[09:58] are also supportive of the asset and so
[10:01] yeah it's your point I think he he
[10:02] really does care about you know what his
[10:04] lasting Legacy is and doing something
[10:07] with Bitcoin is like it's an easy win
[10:10] like it's there's not a lot of downside
[10:12] particularly given all the signaling
[10:14] that he's already done like the only
[10:16] downside is if he doesn't follow through
[10:17] with it um at this point because you
[10:21] know the only people he's going to
[10:22] potentially piss off are like the
[10:24] Elizabeth Warren of the world which like
[10:26] he's probably happy to do that so like I
[10:28] don't think that that's a a concern of
[10:30] his um and so you know he has the power
[10:33] to do various things and and I think you
[10:36] know yeah to your point he he does he
[10:38] certainly cares about his legacy cares
[10:40] about what people think of him um and so
[10:43] yeah I I think you kind of nailed it
[10:45] like I would be more surprised if we
[10:48] don't see some follow through on a lot
[10:50] of these things absolutely and one thing
[10:53] that you mentioned it's actually a
[10:55] really good point of the ETFs because we
[10:57] know ETFs did take time it's not like
[11:00] you turn the ETFs on and you have all
[11:02] the clients and there's a lot of money
[11:04] out of the sun coming in it takes time
[11:07] and uh I think this is really coming
[11:10] full swing in year two three four and uh
[11:13] if I'm not mistaken you're also coming
[11:15] from traditional Finance background what
[11:19] just to make just to give the audience
[11:22] background what did you do there yeah
[11:24] sure so um yeah I started my career in
[11:27] the traditional Finance world um worked
[11:30] on Wall Street for a number of years I I
[11:32] um worked at a company called a big
[11:35] Private Bank uh called Brown Brothers
[11:37] Herman and uh most of what I did there
[11:40] you know initially started on sort of
[11:41] the relationship front office side of
[11:43] things and then ultimately uh sort of
[11:45] migrated to effectively a centralized
[11:48] investment team uh within the private
[11:50] bank there so we managed roughly 60
[11:54] billion in assets and that was uh you
[11:56] know mostly High net worth private
[11:57] clients some smaller end and Foundations
[12:00] mixed in there um but really my my job
[12:04] and our goals were to construct uh
[12:07] portfolios so both uh internal and
[12:10] external uh investment strategy so we
[12:12] had a very concentrated roster of
[12:14] managers uh call it 20 different
[12:16] strategies across the asset class
[12:18] spectrum that then comprised the uh
[12:20] portfolios of our our underlying clients
[12:23] and it was a fascinating role because
[12:25] really what I was tasked with doing was
[12:28] going out in diligence ing any and all
[12:30] fund managers that were you know one
[12:33] most importantly aligned with our sort
[12:34] of investment philosophy at the firm
[12:36] which um you know Brown Brothers is a
[12:38] very uh old institution it was founded
[12:40] in 1818 I think it's the oldest and
[12:44] largest private bank in America um and
[12:47] so you you could imagine it's a very
[12:49] sort of conservative institution uh very
[12:52] first principles thinkers and they they
[12:54] also you know are very much sort of uh
[12:57] Disciples of of Warren Buffett if you
[12:58] will so very cash flow oriented looking
[13:01] for uh you know managers who appreciate
[13:03] quality business models uh management
[13:05] Excellence all the sort of tenants of
[13:08] traditional value investing um and so
[13:11] yeah my role was going out and and
[13:13] diligen in uh fund managers across the
[13:15] asset class spectrum and deciding
[13:17] whether or not to bring them on to the
[13:18] platform and and offer those funds to
[13:20] our underlying clients and so really you
[13:22] know day-to-day I was getting to pick
[13:24] the brains of of some of the smartest
[13:26] investors in the world which you know I
[13:28] was a pretty young at the time which was
[13:30] a an interesting Dynamic of like who am
[13:32] I to to talk to these guys who have made
[13:34] you know in some cases like billions of
[13:36] dollars uh trading you know whatever
[13:38] they're trading uh throughout their
[13:40] career but you know it was in that sense
[13:42] an amazing learning opportunity because
[13:44] I really got to hone my own personal
[13:46] investment philosophy and so I was at
[13:50] the bank until end of 2021 but you know
[13:54] I personally on the side started uh
[13:58] learning about Bitcoin in sort of late
[14:00] 17 so that that bull run and into early
[14:03] 18 I had um you know a typical journey
[14:06] of like an altcoin phase where you know
[14:09] it was funny because sitting at a bank I
[14:12] uh I actually was interested in in
[14:14] ripple xrp at the time because I was
[14:16] like oh like all the banks are going to
[14:17] use this this is so brilliant like also
[14:20] I had I certainly had a unit bias at the
[14:21] time I was like I kind of missed Bitcoin
[14:23] like I need to find something else um
[14:27] and so I I went down that path for
[14:29] probably six or nine months and then
[14:31] that's when sort of that bare Market
[14:33] ensued and sort of the bottom started
[14:34] falling out of the market and I I
[14:38] noticed a few things but the main one
[14:40] was like okay everything's falling here
[14:42] but Bitcoin is is falling way less than
[14:44] a lot of these other assets so what is
[14:46] different what am I missing about
[14:48] Bitcoin in particular and so that's when
[14:49] I sort of really started to go down the
[14:52] rabbit hole in Earnest and learn about
[14:53] the history of money you know I I
[14:55] studied history and economics in college
[14:58] but never once once sort of learned
[14:59] about Austrian economics uh
[15:01] unfortunately so so began to really dig
[15:04] into that um what is money the history
[15:07] of money um and then became more and
[15:10] more convinced that you know Bitcoin was
[15:12] was fundamentally different than all
[15:13] these other assets um and you know was
[15:17] just stacking as aggressively as I could
[15:19] sort of 1819 into 20 and then into 21
[15:24] you know this this sort of growing
[15:27] interest in Bitcoin this passion for it
[15:30] just became so large that I I kind of
[15:32] realized like I've got to do something
[15:33] here I can't just like continue to work
[15:34] in traditional finance and not uh be at
[15:38] least you know occupationally driven by
[15:40] this you know increasing passion that I
[15:42] have in my in my personal life and so I
[15:45] started to think about next steps and
[15:47] leaving the bank and it was funny at the
[15:48] time because the they had like a not in
[15:52] the private banking line of business but
[15:53] in uh another line of business they had
[15:56] sort of a digital asset working group
[15:58] that was like thinking through you know
[16:00] basically how do we use blockchain
[16:01] without uh thinking about Bitcoin and so
[16:04] I I considered momentarily like okay do
[16:06] I try to help those guys figure out the
[16:09] signal of Bitcoin and and not you know
[16:11] necessarily be worried about like the
[16:12] blockchain technology and kind of
[16:15] realized ultimately that would be an
[16:16] arduous path and probably not uh like
[16:19] not too fun to to try to convince others
[16:21] of that and and so I realized it
[16:23] probably made sense to just leave the
[16:24] bank and so I I left in late 21 and
[16:28] interestingly took took a job at
[16:30] coinbase um and I say interestingly
[16:32] because you know at that time I was
[16:34] already sort of heavily convicted in in
[16:36] Bitcoin specifically and very skeptical
[16:38] of the rest of of the crypto Market but
[16:42] I saw it as an opportunity to
[16:43] effectively codify my thesis force
[16:45] myself to dig into some of these other
[16:47] assets these other protocols and you
[16:50] know verify for myself that they were
[16:51] like fundamentally flawed um and it was
[16:54] also just a good opportunity they were
[16:55] effectively building out a dedicated
[16:57] research team within the institutional
[17:00] line of business so um it was familiar
[17:02] to me in the sense of you know working
[17:04] with large pools of capital and thinking
[17:05] about investment strategies and and
[17:07] producing research um and so I was at
[17:10] coinbase for about 12 months and always
[17:12] sort of knew that that was going to be a
[17:14] stepping stone to to something that was
[17:15] Bitcoin specific and so I used that time
[17:18] again as I as I mentioned to really
[17:20] codify my Bitcoin thesis and I came out
[17:23] the other side even more convicted and
[17:24] and you know Bitcoin is the thing here
[17:27] um and it's it's much different than
[17:29] than the rest of this market and so from
[17:31] there I started to think about okay well
[17:32] what are you know what are the next
[17:35] steps from here in terms of of doing
[17:36] something that's Bitcoin focused um and
[17:39] I sort of started to begin uh to Canvas
[17:42] the landscape from a two a couple
[17:44] different angles one just you know where
[17:46] does my where is my skill set applicable
[17:48] and two what is a sustainable business
[17:52] model effectively in the Bitcoin space
[17:54] because I
[17:55] think not you know not super talked
[17:57] about but like it's hard to make money
[17:59] in Bitcoin uh to have a sustainable
[18:01] profitable business you know there's
[18:03] obviously the exchange business that's
[18:04] been relatively successful uh but even
[18:06] if you look at a coinbase like they
[18:08] branched Beyond Bitcoin for business
[18:11] reasons ultimately uh because the
[18:13] realities of that business is they make
[18:16] money by pushing people out the risk
[18:17] curve getting them to trade all these
[18:19] other assets um and so that was I think
[18:22] part of the incentives for that business
[18:24] business ultimately migrating from you
[18:26] know at the beginning being very much a
[18:28] Bitcoin business business um to
[18:30] something much different right now um
[18:32] and so it's hard to make money in
[18:33] Bitcoin is is ultimately the end of the
[18:35] end of the story there so I was looking
[18:37] for opportunities where I was I actually
[18:39] had confidence in the business itself um
[18:42] and so I heard in uh sort of April April
[18:45] of
[18:47] 2023 uh Michael Michael tanguma who's
[18:50] co-founder and CEO of of onramp um I
[18:53] heard him on a podcast uh I think it was
[18:55] Marty Ben's podcast and he was talking
[18:58] about you know launching this new
[18:59] business called onramp and he talked
[19:01] about this concept of multi-institution
[19:05] custody and I had never heard that
[19:07] before but it immediately resonated with
[19:09] with me as like oh wow this thing needs
[19:11] to exist this sort of hybrid approach to
[19:14] custody that's really perfect for uh you
[19:17] know High netw worth individuals but
[19:18] also institutional institutional
[19:20] allocators um and you know just for we
[19:24] can go into this deeper but some some
[19:26] high level context on on multi- instit
[19:28] tion and what onramp does it's it's
[19:30] effectively taking you know bitcoin's
[19:32] native multisig properties and
[19:36] implementing that you know basically at
[19:39] an Institutional level so instead of if
[19:42] you're familiar with like Unchained
[19:44] model they also use multisig and and you
[19:46] know just for added context here Michael
[19:48] tanguma our founder came from Unchained
[19:50] so you could think of onramp as is a
[19:52] quasi Fork of Unchained in the sense
[19:54] that we're using a lot of the same base
[19:56] technology we're using Bitcoin native
[19:58] multisig but instead of the end client
[20:01] holding any private key material we are
[20:03] taking all three of the keys in a two
[20:05] three Quorum and we're Distributing
[20:07] those across distinct institutions so
[20:09] onramp only holds one key and then we
[20:11] partnered with other custodians uh like
[20:13] bitgo to hold the other keys and so none
[20:15] of the entities in the two of three
[20:17] Quorum have unilateral control of the
[20:19] assets and that's the key thing um that
[20:23] you know our whole business is built on
[20:25] this Foundation of this form of custody
[20:26] in the sense that we think it is
[20:28] somewhat revolutionary in that up until
[20:32] this point in Bitcoin custody you've
[20:33] never really had the ability to have
[20:36] real redundancy or fault tolerance in a
[20:39] custody setup there's always been a
[20:41] single point of failure whether that's
[20:43] an individual custody the asset
[20:45] themselves in self- custody or you're
[20:48] trusting a a counterparty like coinbase
[20:50] unilaterally uh to hold the funds and
[20:53] and manage that private key material so
[20:54] you've always had a single point of
[20:56] failure um and with this model allow for
[20:59] is that redundancy that fault tolerance
[21:01] and the elimination of single points of
[21:02] failure and why this it's so critical is
[21:05] for you know particularly on the
[21:06] institutional side it's like and I saw
[21:09] this both at my time at Brown brothers
[21:12] and then at coinbase as well where again
[21:14] I was dealing with these large pools of
[21:16] capital who you know even if they could
[21:18] get there on the Bitcoin thesis itself
[21:20] like they knew they needed exposure to
[21:22] the asset um they couldn't get
[21:24] comfortable with the custody because
[21:26] their options at that time you know were
[21:29] either uh trust trust a counterparty
[21:32] like coinbase unilaterally uh go into
[21:34] something like the grayscale trust which
[21:35] was a poor financial product for a
[21:37] number of reasons uh or try to figure
[21:39] out Key Management themselves which you
[21:42] know for most institutional allocators
[21:43] is kind of just an unrealistic or
[21:45] unpalatable uh Avenue to go down in the
[21:48] sense of like you know if you have an
[21:49] investment Committee of seven people or
[21:51] a board you know who's going to be
[21:53] holding the keys what if there's
[21:54] turnover on the team like there's a lot
[21:56] of considerations that make that very
[21:57] difficult um so realistically like those
[22:00] types of allocators need third party
[22:03] custodians but you know our thinking was
[22:05] well what if there's a way where you
[22:06] don't have to trust one um and and so
[22:10] that is like the beauty of Bitcoin
[22:12] itself like we're using the native
[22:14] properties of the protocol multisig in
[22:15] order to achieve this uh something
[22:17] that's not possible with any other asset
[22:19] right like you can't multisig your gold
[22:21] or your stocks your bonds for stocks or
[22:23] bonds it's less re uh relevant right
[22:26] because they you know they are
[22:29] dissimilar from Bitcoin and gold and
[22:30] that um you know they're not finite or
[22:33] or scarce or beer instruments right so
[22:36] you know when people are diligen in uh
[22:39] Equity or Bond managers like custody is
[22:41] an afterthought in the diligence process
[22:43] right like it's a it's a box checking uh
[22:46] procedure whereas with Bitcoin custody
[22:49] is actually like the most important
[22:51] thing in terms of a diligence process
[22:53] because um you know if you have a
[22:57] long-term multi decade multigenerational
[23:00] thesis on this asset you need to have
[23:03] confidence and conviction that the
[23:04] asset's going to be there in 20 50 years
[23:07] and just you know looking at the history
[23:10] of you know the past 16 years of of of
[23:12] bitcoin's life it's been very difficult
[23:14] to trust single counterparties um it you
[23:17] know
[23:19] it's it's hard to get confidence that
[23:22] effectively the the exchange or the
[23:24] single custodian will you know outlive
[23:27] your ownership of the asset um that
[23:30] historically hasn't really been the case
[23:33] um and
[23:34] so yeah like I was saying like this this
[23:37] form of custody is is unique to bitcoin
[23:40] like you can't do this with anything
[23:41] else so that that's another reason I
[23:42] just think it's so fascinating and um
[23:45] you know really in our minds this is
[23:48] how the custody space for Bitcoin will
[23:50] evolve in that it's a it's just a
[23:53] logical um it's just a logical
[23:56] progression of the technology right like
[23:58] like we're using multisig but we're
[24:00] opening it up to multiple institutions
[24:02] being able to uh basically collaborate
[24:06] and work on behalf of the end client so
[24:08] you know there's I think there's you
[24:10] know there's obvious mantras in Bitcoin
[24:12] like not your keys not your coins which
[24:14] like I think has been very useful for 16
[24:16] years uh because the alternative to not
[24:18] doing that was holding it on a single
[24:20] counterparty holding it on a coinbase
[24:22] which is worse than figuring it out
[24:24] yourself um but now I think there is
[24:27] another option where
[24:29] you again you don't have to trust a
[24:31] single entity unilaterally but you can
[24:33] also abstract away the complexity and
[24:35] also the burden of private Key
[24:36] Management because I think you know for
[24:40] a lot of people self- custody is
[24:42] fantastic and we're very supportive of
[24:43] self- custody like I personally will
[24:45] always have some amount of my stack in
[24:47] in purely self- Sovereign self- custody
[24:49] but increasingly a a a majority of my
[24:52] stack is going to be in an non-ramp
[24:54] Vault just
[24:55] because you know there's a there's a
[24:57] serious Bur burden associated with
[24:59] private Key Management particularly as
[25:00] the price appreciates so you know if if
[25:03] Bitcoin is becoming a larger and larger
[25:05] percentage of of someone's net worth
[25:07] maybe they see the asset 10x or you know
[25:10] 10x a couple times like it becomes this
[25:12] this uh pretty large burden in terms of
[25:15] like okay I can't screw this up or you
[25:18] know I also if I'm securing it on
[25:21] private keys in my house like that's
[25:23] then becomes a risk for you know the $5
[25:25] doll rencher attack obviously like do
[25:27] you want that private key material in
[25:29] your home if you know that's where your
[25:31] family is and that's increasingly a
[25:33] pretty sizable amount of money um I
[25:36] think there's a balance right like
[25:37] there's a place for all these different
[25:38] custody formats and and we are certainly
[25:41] not dogmatic about this but we are just
[25:44] presenting a new format basically and
[25:46] saying like this is an option for at
[25:47] least a percentage of someone's stack uh
[25:50] where you can very easily Access
[25:52] Financial Services like inheritance um
[25:56] and have a portion of your stack that
[25:57] you know you'll pass on to the next
[26:00] Generation right uh because right now
[26:03] like inheritance is pretty tricky if
[26:05] you're if you're just doing self-
[26:06] custody uh even if you can figure out a
[26:08] way to have your loved ones or heirs uh
[26:12] find those keys and access the Bitcoin
[26:14] there's questions around the legal
[26:16] transfer of title of those assets so
[26:18] those assets could enter probate which
[26:19] is a lengthy uh not fun process so there
[26:23] there's other sort of just realities of
[26:25] like tapping into Financial Services as
[26:28] easier if you're using institutional
[26:30] grade custodians uh to to secure the
[26:33] asset um and so yeah that was that was
[26:36] sort of the light bulb that went off for
[26:37] me when I heard Michael talking about
[26:39] this idea and so I just reached out to
[26:41] him called I was like however I can help
[26:43] you build this thing like I want to be
[26:44] involved because I think this is sort of
[26:47] the future of where of where Bitcoin
[26:48] custody is going um and yeah it's been
[26:52] it's been almost two years now which is
[26:53] kind of crazy to think about it's been a
[26:55] wild and fun ride but um you know things
[26:58] are things are progressing very well
[26:59] like there I think we've certainly found
[27:03] that there's product Market fit for this
[27:05] idea um and and a lot of that sort of
[27:09] early traction was a very positive proof
[27:12] statement from longtime bitcoiners are
[27:15] some of our first clients people who
[27:16] have been doing self- custody for years
[27:18] they're very technically competent but
[27:21] they also understand that burden that I
[27:22] was referencing and they love the idea
[27:24] of at least some portion of their stack
[27:27] not being associated with that burden um
[27:29] and really you could also just think of
[27:31] it as like a diversification play uh you
[27:34] know with your with your custody setups
[27:36] like do you want all your eggs in one
[27:38] basket one Arrangement probably not um
[27:41] and so that was an early proof statement
[27:43] as I said like we're on something here
[27:45] because you know a lot of our earliest
[27:47] clients were long-term bitcoiners who
[27:49] had been doing self- custody for a long
[27:50] time but saw the value prop saw the the
[27:53] Merit of this model of custody um and so
[27:56] yeah it's been uh it's been a fun ride
[27:59] amazing yeah it's really I think it's uh
[28:02] needs and there's a lot of like oh you
[28:04] cannot have self custody here or you
[28:06] should not use them like there's a lot
[28:08] of like almost like apple versus uh
[28:11] Samsung fights sometimes in the in the
[28:13] scene where I'm like no like that's not
[28:15] okay like the more uh different models
[28:19] and versions and companies you have
[28:22] competing for the same thing the better
[28:24] it is uh and maybe with self custody if
[28:28] you have all your money in Bitcoin maybe
[28:29] it's a good idea especially if you have
[28:32] a lot of money in Bitcoin uh I'm
[28:34] probably talking if they have like five
[28:37] coins plus uh you should think about
[28:40] maybe having two completely different
[28:42] solutions uh especially like above 10
[28:46] above 50 above 100 coins like no
[28:48] question you should not have everything
[28:50] in one solution yeah uh so multivendor
[28:53] multi- institutional multi signature
[28:56] like whatever you can do spread them out
[28:59] uh because it's not as expensive it's
[29:01] not that like oh I'm gonna charge so
[29:03] much so like that so uh that's that's
[29:06] where I'm standing I'm like yeah try try
[29:09] many different things out and and see
[29:11] what's the best thing for you but have
[29:13] self- custody in some form yeah uh and
[29:16] in absolutely any way you want and also
[29:19] like you know
[29:21] absolutely you know have have great
[29:23] reverence for self- custody just in the
[29:25] sense of like it's it is critical to the
[29:28] protocol like the ability to self-
[29:30] custody the asset going back to its
[29:31] Bearer nature like that call option on
[29:34] the asset is super critical because in a
[29:37] lot of ways it it serves as a check and
[29:40] balance on custodians right because if
[29:43] if you always know that the end client
[29:45] can take the assets off the platform if
[29:47] you are not you know fulfilling your
[29:49] duties as a as a counterparty or
[29:50] custodian that inherently makes them
[29:53] more trustworthy right like they don't
[29:54] want to lose client assets if they are
[29:57] um you know being a a custodian for
[29:59] Bitcoin so it is again this unique
[30:02] quality of the asset um that should over
[30:05] time you know actually incentivize
[30:08] better Behavior and the Really
[30:10] fascinating thing about that Dynamic
[30:12] within the context of multi-institution
[30:15] custody is because the none of the
[30:18] entities actually have unilateral
[30:20] control that that sort of incentive to
[30:23] be a good actor and act in good faith is
[30:25] even greater than if you are the single
[30:27] custodian because if you just you know
[30:29] if you think about a single custodian
[30:32] you know to quote unquote collude they
[30:34] don't have to convince anybody they just
[30:36] do it themselves right whether it's uh
[30:38] you know malfeasance or just negligence
[30:40] like something could go wrong um again
[30:43] and you have that single point of
[30:44] failure whereas when you spread out that
[30:46] counterparty risk um it becomes much
[30:49] harder for things to go wrong because
[30:52] you know none of these entities actually
[30:53] have control to make that type of
[30:55] unilateral decision or to unilaterally
[30:58] screw something up um and so again it's
[31:00] just that that fault tolerance and that
[31:02] redundancy that I think is super
[31:04] critical and also just the reality of
[31:07] like that's how that's how we scale this
[31:09] thing because I think there's an
[31:11] argument to be made that the reason
[31:14] we're already we're not already at a
[31:15] million dollars a coin is because
[31:17] custody is pretty difficult and and
[31:20] there's been a lot of um horror stories
[31:23] you know I think we have a slide in some
[31:25] of our decks that that speaks to this
[31:27] but it's like something like $650
[31:29] billion dollar of losses over time from
[31:33] from poor custody so that includes both
[31:36] people just losing private Keys uh in
[31:38] self- custody or exchange hacks um so a
[31:43] two trillion asset almost 700 billion of
[31:46] losses from poor custody it's like maybe
[31:50] we need to like think more deeply about
[31:51] how we're seeing this asset and that's
[31:53] sort of The Stance we've taken is like
[31:56] it's you know we're 16 years in but we
[31:57] haven't really figured this thing out in
[31:59] terms of how to actually store it and um
[32:02] I think that's the re part of the reason
[32:04] at least we're not already at a higher
[32:05] market cap because it's very difficult
[32:09] for whether it's a high- net worth
[32:11] individual who's going to make a serious
[32:13] allocation or it's an institution who
[32:15] has fiduciary duty to underlying clients
[32:18] like comes back to again like getting
[32:20] conviction in the custody is what
[32:23] prevents people from One allocating but
[32:26] then two actually having a meaning full
[32:28] position size right because what we see
[32:30] a lot is on the institutional side is is
[32:33] people very much dipping their toes in
[32:35] right like half a percent 1% allocation
[32:38] to the asset the reason it's not 10
[32:40] isn't because they're not convicted in
[32:42] the thesis it's because they're not
[32:43] convicted in the custody and that it's
[32:45] going to be there in 10 years um and so
[32:47] they very much view the allocation as a
[32:52] a risk bucket like a risk on asset um
[32:54] and part of that part of the reason for
[32:56] that is is the custody
[32:58] um and so I think this is how we scale
[33:01] to these larger pools of capital and
[33:02] allow them to have the conviction um is
[33:05] is through this fault tolerance this
[33:07] redundancy that they know they can't be
[33:09] knocked out of the game if a a custodian
[33:11] fails right um
[33:15] and it's also like you know for again a
[33:19] fiduciary or an Institutional allocator
[33:22] like they can they can come to terms
[33:24] with uh an investment not working out
[33:27] because they got the thesis wrong right
[33:30] um what they can't deal with is getting
[33:33] the thesis right but still having a zero
[33:35] for the allocation because they screwed
[33:37] up the custodian that's like what you
[33:39] get fired for that's what that's when
[33:41] clients leave like they can't afford for
[33:43] that to be the case um and so I think
[33:46] you know as people get more
[33:49] sophisticated come up the curve on their
[33:51] their education around Bitcoin it's like
[33:53] very unique custodial properties I think
[33:56] more and more people going to adopt this
[33:59] this form of custy where the the
[34:01] counterparty risk is effectively
[34:02] distributed and you have uh again that
[34:05] fault tolerance I partnered up with coin
[34:09] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[34:11] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[34:14] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[34:17] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[34:20] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[34:23] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[34:26] show that you are a Bitcoin Co and that
[34:28] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[34:32] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:34] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:38] watch collections you have the date of
[34:40] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:43] there and of course also the block
[34:46] height and which EPO we are currently in
[34:49] I love the level of detail they put in
[34:52] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:54] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:57] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[35:00] love those watches so so much if you
[35:03] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[35:05] regular basis I'll guess you already
[35:07] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[35:10] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[35:13] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[35:16] personal recommendation for Hardware
[35:17] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[35:20] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[35:22] gift for a friend who has still the
[35:25] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get
[35:27] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[35:31] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[35:35] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[35:37] step is to really level up your
[35:39] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[35:42] have the most secure self- custody setup
[35:45] you have to secure your own devices you
[35:48] have to protect your privacy you have to
[35:51] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:53] on where you live you even want to have
[35:56] a plan B a citizen ship where you can
[35:58] move in case something goes really
[36:00] really wrong and through all those steps
[36:02] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[36:05] step by step and if you visit the
[36:08] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[36:12] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[36:14] out how you can level up your
[36:17] sovereignty that's super interesting
[36:18] what you brought up that not further
[36:21] down like more market cap in in in
[36:23] Bitcoin because it's what do you think
[36:27] is the the lack there there's like two
[36:30] aspects for me there the one aspect is
[36:32] the the educational side of like okay we
[36:35] also had to explain to people how you
[36:37] use a username and password now everyone
[36:40] knows how to use username and password
[36:42] now we're in in the evolution of like uh
[36:45] having two Factor unification password
[36:47] managers and it gets more and more
[36:48] advanced even like non-tech people use
[36:51] those things uh this is like the
[36:54] educational part but it's the other part
[36:56] of it is just like Building Services
[36:58] building products building the
[37:00] technology to make it easier um what do
[37:03] you think is like uh the the bigger
[37:06] hurdle is like the educational the the
[37:08] time aspect is like we we need more
[37:11] services more products is like more
[37:13] technology that has to be built yeah
[37:15] it's it's tough to say which is more
[37:17] important because I think it's both I
[37:19] think the the real answer is it's both
[37:20] Market structure the different products
[37:23] and services that are required and then
[37:25] it's it's obviously education at but if
[37:27] I had to pick I would probably say
[37:29] education just
[37:30] because you know we're we're reminded of
[37:33] this often in the work that we do
[37:35] talking with institutional allocators
[37:37] like we are still so fraking early and I
[37:39] know that's cliche to say at this point
[37:41] but um particularly with respect to
[37:46] like the sort of the conflation of
[37:49] Bitcoin and and the rest of crypto like
[37:51] that's where I'd say we're still the
[37:52] earliest is like there's been a lot of
[37:56] um you know institutions or other
[37:58] Financial entities that have come into
[37:59] the space and and they think they've
[38:01] done their diligence they think they
[38:02] know what they're looking at um yet they
[38:05] are still conflating Bitcoin with the
[38:06] rest of crypto and for that reason they
[38:08] view it as a risk asset um and you know
[38:13] in our view Bitcoin is is really the
[38:15] most like risk-off allocation you could
[38:17] possibly have it's it's outside money
[38:19] it's uh transparent monetary policy uh
[38:23] immutable like all these things we know
[38:25] makes it a risk-off asset
[38:28] and and because these allocators are
[38:31] still conflating Bitcoin with the rest
[38:33] of crypto because crypto is is risk on
[38:35] like it is Venture Tech if I'm being
[38:37] generous about it right um and so by
[38:40] completing those things they're just
[38:41] looping you know lumping Bitcoin in to
[38:44] this to this risk on bucket and that I
[38:46] think that's what's that's the biggest
[38:49] piece of Education that needs to occur
[38:50] is just like getting down to the
[38:52] fundamentals of how these protocols work
[38:54] and and frankly it just takes time and
[38:56] also there's also you know Bitcoin is so
[38:58] multidisiplinary that different aspects
[39:01] of the thesis different aspects of the
[39:03] fundamentals resonate differently with
[39:05] different folks um people come at this
[39:07] from all different angles some for some
[39:09] people it's it's the mining aspect of it
[39:11] that is is where the light bulb goes off
[39:14] like you know one of my favorite things
[39:16] to to you know mention to people when
[39:19] they are very much sort of on the
[39:20] outside looking in and wanting to learn
[39:22] more um is I just talk about Mining and
[39:26] I and I I tell for the first time in
[39:28] human history we have the ability to
[39:30] monetize energy in a location agnostic
[39:32] manner through Bitcoin mining and like
[39:35] that typically blows people's minds
[39:36] because they've never they don't know
[39:37] how mining works and they've never
[39:39] thought about this effectively a form of
[39:41] utility for Bitcoin that has nothing to
[39:43] do with its price um or it's you know
[39:46] its number go up technology like this is
[39:48] simply just allowing us to be a more U
[39:51] more efficient species in terms of how
[39:53] we monetize energy um and so that's
[39:57] that's just to say like there's all
[39:59] these different touch points or these
[40:00] different anecdotes that resonate
[40:02] differently with people um and so it
[40:05] it's really a matter of knowing who
[40:07] you're talking to knowing where they are
[40:09] on their journey of understanding and
[40:11] ultimately at the end of the day it it
[40:13] does require some amount of curiosity on
[40:16] behalf of of the person you're speaking
[40:17] to
[40:18] because you could try to educate someone
[40:21] you know as as as strongly as you as you
[40:25] can but if they're not willing to listen
[40:28] it's it's not going to work and I think
[40:30] you know uh our other co-founder Jesse
[40:33] Myers who you've had on the Pod he wrote
[40:35] a piece uh a great piece called the the
[40:40] why the yep Elite don't uh understand
[40:41] Bitcoin I think he wrote in in like
[40:44] 21 and that speaks to a similar Concept
[40:47] in the sense that particularly in the
[40:50] institutional world or even just someone
[40:52] who has made a good amount of money in
[40:54] trafi and are on Wall Street it's very
[40:58] difficult for them to look at this asset
[41:02] that they have no ability to have an
[41:04] edge on right like they they've built
[41:06] their career probably having like some
[41:08] Edge in markets the other thing to think
[41:11] about there too is you know it it
[41:13] requires some amount of curiosity on
[41:15] behalf of the person you're talking to
[41:17] um you know like I said like different
[41:20] different things resonate for different
[41:22] folks but you know you could you could
[41:24] be hitting someone hard over the head
[41:26] with all the facts and the world but if
[41:28] there isn't um the desire the the intent
[41:31] to learn um it's going to be a difficult
[41:34] uh conversation effectively and and part
[41:36] of that too is um you know what our
[41:38] other co-founder Jesse Myers has written
[41:40] about in one of uh his great pieces I
[41:43] think back in in 21 around you know why
[41:46] the yepy elite don't understand Bitcoin
[41:48] it speaks to a similar Dynamic of you
[41:51] know if you're someone sitting in the
[41:53] trafi world or on Wall Street and you've
[41:55] made significant wealth from doing XYZ
[41:58] thing in financial markets um it's very
[42:01] difficult for you to look at this thing
[42:02] Bitcoin and say um you know it's just
[42:05] it's just this store value Asset there's
[42:07] no Edge to investing in it right so all
[42:10] of your preconceived notions about
[42:13] making money in finance sort of fall
[42:15] apart because there's no there's no Edge
[42:16] to it there's no investment strategy
[42:18] around Bitcoin that um you need to
[42:21] really internalize other than Buy and
[42:23] Hold um which is pretty pretty
[42:25] straightforward and so folks like that
[42:27] tend to have a difficult time um coming
[42:30] around to the thesis really because it's
[42:33] well one it sort of Alters your
[42:34] worldview generally speaking because it
[42:36] it makes you question you know what
[42:38] money is which which most people in that
[42:39] world if you've if you've benefited from
[42:41] the FI system you're unlikely to have
[42:43] questioned that throughout your career
[42:46] um and then once you do it does take a a
[42:50] real amount of huus um or or you know
[42:53] death of the ego to recognize like maybe
[42:56] I was wrong about what money is um and
[43:00] again like for someone who has benefited
[43:04] greatly from the Fiat system it's just
[43:05] it's it's more difficult for them to to
[43:08] get over that hurdle generally speaking
[43:10] and so that's a lot of what we see on
[43:11] the institutional side still to this day
[43:14] like you know we do a lot of um a lot of
[43:17] outbound to to institutions and we still
[43:19] get some responses that are like rat
[43:21] poison would never touch it and it's
[43:23] like okay um like I know you have done
[43:27] zero work on this um and that's okay for
[43:31] now but we're here we're here when uh
[43:32] when you want to think about it because
[43:34] that's that's the thing it's like if
[43:35] there's no desire there like it's going
[43:37] to be a very difficult conversation um I
[43:39] asked originally I think like 30 or 40
[43:42] minutes ago where uh uh if you were in
[43:46] TR fi before because of the deps because
[43:48] I'm kind of interested in your uh few
[43:51] and insights what do you have with with
[43:53] ETFs I never worked in trii never had
[43:55] any Finance background and you probably
[43:57] have better understanding of uh how long
[44:00] those things actually take is like the 6
[44:03] months 12 months uh a period of like
[44:06] talking with those high with individuals
[44:08] talking with those institutions uh and
[44:11] then we we might see like all like ETFs
[44:14] actually come in the swing and I think
[44:16] that's uh one thing we we kind of get
[44:18] into in in the in this in the late stage
[44:22] of the podcast now yeah I think um on on
[44:26] specific the ETF front it's um it's it's
[44:31] mostly you know around what I was
[44:33] mentioning earlier around like there are
[44:35] just certain wirehouses and entities and
[44:37] banks that haven't turned on the ability
[44:39] uh for their clients to to buy the ETF
[44:42] um and if they have it's in a basically
[44:45] like handicapped way where there needs
[44:47] to be um an explicit ask for it um and
[44:51] so I think that that will just take time
[44:53] but it will open up and I think part of
[44:57] that too is going to be the new
[44:58] administration because I think the
[45:00] reality of the past four years is Banks
[45:03] and other entities have been very
[45:05] cautious um not only given sort of the
[45:08] antagonistic stance that the the current
[45:11] and soon to be former Administration has
[45:13] had towards the space um but also just
[45:17] the reality of like FTX blowing up like
[45:20] that was a big moment where people were
[45:22] you know thinking about doing something
[45:24] in the space and then ultimately took a
[45:27] back because of what happened there um
[45:29] and so there was sort of that malaise
[45:32] for a few years around just these
[45:34] entities moving probably more slowly
[45:37] than they they otherwise would and so I
[45:39] think you know there is an argument to
[45:40] be made that that changes um with this
[45:42] new Administration and there's a more
[45:46] sort of just welcomed nature towards the
[45:48] asset class and some of these entities
[45:50] will start turning these things on or at
[45:52] least um you know giving their sales
[45:55] folks the ability to go out and talk
[45:57] about uh Bitcoin with their clients um
[45:59] and so that's one side just on the ETF
[46:01] stuff another part of your question like
[46:04] around sort of just the institutional
[46:05] sales cycle uh I think is worth worth
[46:08] calling out like you know when I was at
[46:10] Brown Brothers we would diligence a fund
[46:14] you know anywhere
[46:17] from six to 18 months like we had some
[46:21] very long diligence processes um and
[46:23] that's just kind of the way things work
[46:25] like there's a lot of different uh ele
[46:26] elements that go into a diligence
[46:28] process from understanding the
[46:30] investment thesis to doing sort of
[46:32] operational due diligence all you know
[46:34] compliance needs to be involved uh and
[46:36] there's many different rungs of sort of
[46:39] approvals um and so I think that's
[46:42] that's also what we've seen at onramp as
[46:44] we go out and we sort of um talk with
[46:47] institutional allocators that has also
[46:49] been the case it's a very long sales
[46:50] cycle we've had some success in that
[46:53] side I mean just for for some high Lev
[46:55] context on the business um um you know
[46:57] we really have two segments of the
[46:59] business today uh sort of more
[47:00] individual Private Client Focus which
[47:02] you could think of um as as mostly
[47:05] individuals High Networth folks um we
[47:07] technically don't have any account
[47:08] minimums but there's a certain level uh
[47:10] where our fees start to kind of make
[47:12] sense um so we skew a little bit more up
[47:14] Market um and then the other side of the
[47:16] business is institutional and um you
[47:20] know we've had some success there uh
[47:22] back in November um it was announced so
[47:25] the the first pensions in the United
[47:27] Kingdom to allocate to bitcoin uh did so
[47:30] through our uh our onr Bitcoin trust so
[47:33] we have a trust vehicle that looks and
[47:35] feels similar to an ETF in that it's a
[47:37] gr Tor trust uh structure but on the
[47:39] back end we're using multi-institution
[47:41] custody which what I described earlier
[47:43] it's also a private placement fund so
[47:45] that allows us a little bit more Flex
[47:47] flexibility so we can actually allow for
[47:49] in kind subscriptions and redemptions so
[47:51] you can move Bitcoin in and out of our
[47:53] trust vehicle something that's not
[47:55] possible with the ETFs uh
[47:57] and so the uh pension consultant that we
[48:01] worked with out in the UK uh decided to
[48:04] go with us so they they diligen over 80
[48:07] different sort of Bitcoin trusts or
[48:09] Bitcoin funds to get exposure for their
[48:11] underlying pension clients um and
[48:13] ultimately decided to go with ours
[48:15] because of um really the custody is what
[48:18] it came down to and also that ability to
[48:20] have ink kind subscriptions and
[48:22] redemptions um and so but that that
[48:25] sales that diligence process was roughly
[48:28] 12 months like we had been talking to
[48:30] them for almost over a year um to get
[48:33] that fully over the line so these things
[48:35] do just take time and that's why I think
[48:38] you know the sort of feel like there's
[48:40] been a meme for the past five years of
[48:42] like the institutions are coming um they
[48:45] actually are coming now but it's still
[48:47] going to just take time um for them to
[48:51] to sort of get through all these
[48:52] different forms of approvals do their
[48:54] due diligence get up to speed um so yeah
[48:57] it just it takes
[48:58] time absolutely it's it's kind of I
[49:02] think most people don't understand how
[49:03] early we are and still the the
[49:06] opportunity is huge like in in the just
[49:08] in the very short term uh because we
[49:11] have it's interesting also with
[49:13] corporations they don't they take time
[49:15] but we don't know what kind of talks
[49:17] they into because we have an
[49:20] amazing um example with micro strategy
[49:23] that has to be kind of on the radar of
[49:26] almost all the CFOs like micro strategy
[49:29] uh a business model before Bitcoin that
[49:33] was kind of slowly getting slower like I
[49:36] I don't want to see dying off but it was
[49:38] definitely in in the distraction in in
[49:41] getting more more limited uh and now
[49:44] with Bitcoin since they adopted Bitcoin
[49:46] they have been the fastest growing
[49:47] company uh in in the S&B in the faster
[49:51] than any company in the S&B 500 I think
[49:54] they are still not in there if I'm not
[49:56] wrong
[49:57] not thep but they I think the end of the
[50:00] year they got added to the NASDAQ 100
[50:03] yeah that's that's an amazing thing so
[50:05] the point I was trying to make is like
[50:07] there are so many companies that look at
[50:10] those things like a meta like an alphab
[50:12] like like in Amerson especially meta is
[50:15] interesting because uh Mark zberg
[50:18] founder still has so much uh influence
[50:20] if he really wants to do it and he might
[50:22] just do it uh he could actually go ahead
[50:25] Apple bit more complicated alphabet a
[50:28] little bit more complicated but those
[50:29] are the the wild cards of like yeah
[50:31] maybe like we see a meta saying like oh
[50:34] right let's let's let's have like 5% of
[50:37] our balance sheet in Bitcoin that that's
[50:38] just like is a absolute wild card that
[50:42] would be uh that would be a shot across
[50:44] the bow for every every other corporate
[50:46] in the world I think to your point what
[50:49] we've seen so far on the corporate
[50:51] adoption side is like somewhat anomalous
[50:55] and and what I mean by that is like
[50:58] sailor needed to exist uh and he needed
[51:01] to have that level of unilateral control
[51:04] over the decision-making now obviously
[51:06] he like presented the idea let people
[51:09] get out if they wanted to but he was
[51:10] going to do it regardless um and you
[51:13] know not every corporate has that level
[51:16] of uh whether it's the original owner or
[51:19] the CEO or the chairman of the board
[51:21] having that much unilateral control to
[51:22] make that type of decision um and so I
[51:26] think you know the the corporate
[51:28] adoption we've seen thus far is similar
[51:30] to that like if you look at um you know
[51:32] Eric semler at simar scientific like he
[51:34] also had a similar amount of control to
[51:36] make that decision I think with these
[51:38] some some of these larger corporates
[51:40] like an apple like an alphabet I my my
[51:43] assumption is like there's just still
[51:45] way too much bureaucracy and not enough
[51:48] um unilateral control by one individual
[51:50] uh or you know Consortium of individuals
[51:53] who all have consensus on the idea um to
[51:55] make that type move Zuckerberg is
[51:58] interesting because I think he has some
[52:00] goats that are like named Maxi or
[52:02] Bitcoin I forget so like I'm pretty sure
[52:05] he owns Bitcoin um and so yeah that one
[52:09] is interesting because he does have
[52:10] enough control to make the move the
[52:12] other one that's interesting is uh is
[52:13] Michael Dell which you know he's he's
[52:16] been uh on Twitter the past year or so
[52:19] sort of highlighting his interest and uh
[52:21] love of Bitcoin um but hasn't hasn't uh
[52:24] sort of introduced that to his his his
[52:27] company for for whatever reason so
[52:28] that's another interesting one but you
[52:30] know I think I I kind of think of it as
[52:33] like almost a barbell of like you're
[52:36] going to have some larger
[52:38] companies um do this where they have
[52:42] someone who has enough control and then
[52:44] the other end of the spectrum is going
[52:45] to be smaller companies where there's
[52:47] obviously an owner a Founder an
[52:48] entrepreneur who definitely has enough
[52:50] control to do this because it's just a
[52:51] smaller organization and so that's where
[52:53] you're going to see it sort of mostly at
[52:55] those two ends of the like large entity
[52:57] that has control yeah There You Go the
[53:00] goats Max of Bitcoin the goats in 2021
[53:03] and high high end of the of the bull
[53:06] market it's not impossible that he he
[53:09] pulls something out like but sorry I
[53:10] didn't want to inter interrupt you no no
[53:13] no I I appreciate it I needed to see
[53:15] needed to see the goats um but yeah
[53:17] that's like that's kind of how I see it
[53:19] playing out it's like you have two ends
[53:20] of the spectrum like large entity with
[53:23] sort of an anomalous situation where
[53:26] someone has enough control and then it's
[53:27] just going to be smaller businesses um
[53:30] who are adopting this in Mass because
[53:32] and you've seen this to an extent but
[53:33] you just hear less about it whether it's
[53:35] a private company or just a small public
[53:38] um but it seems like almost you know
[53:40] every other day there's a new
[53:42] announcement of of some company
[53:43] somewhere in the world adopting a
[53:45] Bitcoin treasury strategy so uh yeah
[53:48] that's that's super encouraging as well
[53:49] and and you know sailor's
[53:51] been not only sort of setting the
[53:54] example for how to do it but he's just
[53:55] been a um you know an educator and uh
[53:59] you know just a great sort of Ambassador
[54:00] for for the asset um and so I think you
[54:04] know people are picking up on that it is
[54:07] still shocking though you know I'll talk
[54:09] to some Normie friends and like there
[54:12] are still people have no idea who
[54:14] Michael sailor is like like have no idea
[54:16] what Michael strategy does have no idea
[54:18] that this has been occurring for the
[54:19] past four years and it's like the best
[54:21] performing stock and all he's been doing
[54:23] just accumulating as much Bitcoin as
[54:25] possible like we are still somewhat in a
[54:28] an echo chamber or bubble that we think
[54:30] everyone knows who this guy is um you
[54:33] know I think that continues to change as
[54:35] the as the Playbook continues to play
[54:37] out obviously and you know ultimately
[54:39] does get added to the S&P and becomes
[54:41] harder and harder to ignore as micro
[54:44] strategy enters these uh Benchmark
[54:47] indices what what then in turn happens
[54:50] is this flywheel where effectively you
[54:54] know anybody who's running an active
[54:55] strategy in the equities World um if
[54:59] they are underweight micro strategy
[55:02] relative to The Benchmark that is going
[55:04] to show up on their attribution report
[55:06] at month end or quarter end or year end
[55:08] and say you know this amount of negative
[55:11] contribution resulted from the index
[55:14] having XYZ exposure to micro strategy
[55:16] and you having zero so that is something
[55:19] that is part of you know what gets
[55:21] talked about a lot is like the career
[55:24] risk of Bitcoin sort of inverting a
[55:26] certain point I think we're we're
[55:28] somewhere in a gray area where that's
[55:29] beginning to invert where it becomes
[55:31] riskier to not have exposure to bitcoin
[55:34] than to actually have Expos than to you
[55:36] know put your neck out and say we need
[55:37] Bitcoin exposure I think that's in the
[55:39] process of changing um still early there
[55:42] but um the idea is that like you know as
[55:46] a micro strategy enters the these
[55:48] Benchmark indices it becomes harder and
[55:50] harder to ignore and there's also the
[55:52] potential reality that a manager is
[55:55] underperforming
[55:56] due to their lack of exposure and that's
[55:59] where it really starts to
[56:01] flip it's super inter I just want to add
[56:04] on that Michael sailor thing because I
[56:06] experienced that I was invited to the
[56:07] 100K party and I told people in my like
[56:10] oh I go to Michael sailor's party and
[56:12] some know Bitcoin and some like oh wow
[56:14] crazy and some are like okay like who
[56:17] like you you're driveling for one party
[56:19] to my like that that seems like a little
[56:22] bit ridiculous I'm like yeah like if you
[56:25] don't know who m it does seem ridiculous
[56:27] to fly one party from Austria to
[56:31] Miami and I think I think he I don't
[56:34] know what his Ambitions are and if he he
[56:37] would even like to do that but uh the F
[56:41] same thing what Donald Trump did in in
[56:44] the election he kind of should do also
[56:47] for Bitcoin like Donald Trump went to
[56:49] Long ball and and all those podcasts
[56:52] even like edin Ross the the streamer uh
[56:55] and this brought him probably a good
[56:57] amount of the the the younger uh male
[57:01] crowd also for for Donald Trump uh and I
[57:04] think that would help uh push him and
[57:08] with that also Bitcoin in different
[57:10] crowds if uh he just reaches out to like
[57:13] Lan Paul and do those uh like mainstream
[57:17] YouTubers uh to to talk with him I think
[57:20] that would would be really interesting
[57:22] to see obviously I don't know if he even
[57:25] wants to do that and if they also want
[57:27] to do that no clue but I think it would
[57:29] be an interesting intersection it would
[57:32] definitely be something like I uh rarely
[57:36] watch uh Bitcoin content these days it
[57:39] has to be something interesting um
[57:41] because I produ so much uh so but seeing
[57:45] someone like addin Ross interviewing
[57:47] Michael SAA that would be an interesting
[57:49] combination would bring something new
[57:52] definitely onto L uh and uh he does that
[57:56] already where he goes onto like real
[57:59] estate channels like the grem stefen one
[58:02] and then like other ones so he already
[58:04] kind of does that and I think um he he
[58:08] he will be a figure and and does that in
[58:11] the future also he does a great job in
[58:14] in doing that the one the one everyone
[58:16] always talks about is is uh Rogan
[58:18] obviously um you know I think Rogan had
[58:22] Andreas on back in the day like I think
[58:24] like 2016 or something thing uh but
[58:27] since then hasn't really had anyone on
[58:29] that is talking about Bitcoin
[58:31] specifically comes up here and there in
[58:33] various discussions but he hasn't had
[58:35] anybody on recently um and I've heard a
[58:38] few theories around this of like well
[58:40] why not it seems obvious that he would
[58:42] one I think you know sailor would be an
[58:45] obvious choice part of the potential
[58:49] concern there is like sailor tends to
[58:51] just kind of go on Long monologues
[58:53] whereas I think Rogan really likes to
[58:55] have like a a back and forth
[58:56] conversation so I don't know how that
[58:58] would work if it would work well or not
[59:01] um I think seller would still do a good
[59:03] job but it's just does to your point
[59:05] does Rogan want to have that
[59:06] conversation where he's getting talked
[59:07] at talked at about the history of money
[59:09] for three hours um the other one that
[59:13] comes up is like MERS which I think he
[59:15] would be good on Rogan um able to have
[59:18] more of that freeing conversation for
[59:20] sure I'm curious though like who do you
[59:23] think as a podcas yourself like who who
[59:25] do you think would be the best to go on
[59:27] a show like
[59:28] Rogan uh I think first of all I think
[59:32] it's uh just met of time till like a
[59:36] huge Bitcoin is on I mean Jack dorsy was
[59:38] not that long ago also on there and he's
[59:40] kind of a bitcoiner but the con they
[59:42] didn't really talk about Bitcoin so like
[59:45] there are some bitcoiners here and there
[59:47] on there I mean check doy comes to my
[59:49] mind that was on um but yeah like a
[59:52] Bitcoin conversation on Rogan uh I think
[59:56] actually Jack Ms would be amazing to
[59:59] have him on I think might be from like
[60:02] the energy and the wi better fitting to
[60:05] Rogan uh but yeah like sailor would be
[60:09] awesome it would really be interesting
[60:11] because Rogan is just uh probably top
[60:15] three people or like maybe like a top
[60:18] person of like having conversations with
[60:20] people because just he does it so much
[60:22] with with everyone uh would be
[60:24] interesting how he handles and how the
[60:27] conversation goes it would be something
[60:29] it be watch it would be hilarious at the
[60:31] very least yeah it's it's it definitely
[60:35] would be interesting I don't know if
[60:37] like um Rong also does that like I I
[60:41] don't watch a lot of chogan podcast I
[60:43] watched like maybe like 10 or 20 in my
[60:45] life uh which is a good amount but not
[60:49] so it would be interesting to see a Rog
[60:52] sailor one but I think like uh more
[60:55] interest
[60:56] would maybe like be a jack maras one
[60:58] from from just from the energy side of
[61:01] things is there someone else I'm
[61:03] thinking of someone else if there's
[61:05] someone that could also be interesting
[61:07] to see in Rong would be a good fit um
[61:11] that's the thing like uh there's so much
[61:13] talk about uh oh they like big bit
[61:16] podcast bit uh big Bitcoin podcasters
[61:19] and there's like content creators out
[61:21] there but I feel like there pretty thin
[61:24] spread still like if if you think about
[61:26] oh who's like bitcoin's high signal than
[61:29] Maxi and who's Big like Jeff one that
[61:33] comes to is uh Matthew Pines I think
[61:35] would be good on on Rogan or even any
[61:38] any large pod I think he would
[61:39] absolutely crush it um and just come
[61:42] from a perspective that isn't like
[61:45] uh sort of overtly like crazy Bitcoin
[61:48] Maxi guy like I think he could he could
[61:50] jive with with Rogan and also you know
[61:52] talk about things other than Bitcoin
[61:54] whether it's geopolitics or National
[61:56] Security those types of things um could
[61:58] make for a great discussion I did you
[62:01] saw the ra Paul one on Dar of CEO I was
[62:06] so uh disappointed that Dar of a CEO
[62:11] picked him like they have so much so so
[62:14] many people to to choose from and then
[62:17] they pick him and I'm like I was because
[62:20] I I really like uh sometimes his podcast
[62:23] he has some interesting guests on and he
[62:24] has also a good way interviewing people
[62:27] it's very structured and nice uh but
[62:30] it's just like I was like ah I cannot
[62:33] watch this guy anymore like I didn't
[62:35] even watch it and and it kind of blew
[62:37] diary for CEO for me like it's a good
[62:40] podcast and now he picks that guy that
[62:42] that now I question all of the other
[62:44] guests also right yeah
[62:47] exactly but yeah super interesting um
[62:51] one thing I'm uh maybe before we close
[62:54] up uh that that I want to get into that
[62:56] is like you you talked about unip buas
[62:59] how it also was interesting for you in
[63:00] the beginning when do you think we shift
[63:04] naturally organically from like this
[63:06] Bitcoin do satosi or maybe like do a
[63:08] different one away from Bitcoin like
[63:10] what what what needs Bitcoin to hit to
[63:12] for the people to say like oh like
[63:14] doesn't make sense to talk about Bitcoin
[63:16] we should talk about
[63:17] satoshis yeah that's an interesting
[63:19] question I I don't know if I have like a
[63:21] great answer for it but I think my gut
[63:24] says we're a long way away from that
[63:26] from from transitioning to Satoshi and
[63:30] um for a few reasons but the main one
[63:33] being like sort of a double-edged sword
[63:35] like the unit bias thing in some way
[63:37] just like sort of behaviorally or from a
[63:40] psychological perspective and that yes
[63:42] for a new entrant um they are attracted
[63:47] to something that is a smaller unit
[63:50] because they they with their lack of
[63:52] knowledge of of supply of the asset they
[63:55] just think okay lower better uh has more
[63:58] upside potential so that's the issue
[64:01] with with the uni bias but the other
[64:03] reality of of Bitcoin and it's like you
[64:06] know price above 100K like there is a
[64:09] positive element of that large
[64:11] number and I don't think we can discount
[64:14] that because you know however long the
[64:17] journey from 100K to a million to then
[64:19] 10 million is like those are
[64:21] psychological markers that are important
[64:25] for future adoption in my mind um and so
[64:27] I don't think transitioning to a smaller
[64:31] unit makes sense really within the next
[64:35] several decades like I think it takes a
[64:37] long time for that to be and part of it
[64:39] too is probably also like increased
[64:42] adoption uh from an medium of exchange
[64:45] perspective um where if you're uh and
[64:48] again this is like far into the future
[64:49] but denominating in Bitcoin using as a
[64:52] unit of account and a Medi medium
[64:54] exchange then yeah maybe it makes sense
[64:55] to to scale down the unit uh to a satos
[64:58] or something else just for ease of of
[65:01] use and ease of um medium exchange
[65:03] basically but I think we're a ways away
[65:05] from that and and and the other part
[65:07] that I would emphasize is like I do
[65:10] think there's Merit in the large number
[65:13] bias of like oh this thing's at
[65:16] 100K now uh maybe it can go to a million
[65:18] like I think that's the psychological
[65:20] barrier of 100K is important for a lot
[65:22] of reasons but part of it is just for
[65:25] every who thought it was going to zero
[65:27] and would never hit 100K well it did and
[65:30] so now that sort of flips your thinking
[65:31] to like well okay maybe this isn't going
[65:33] to zero but does this does this now mean
[65:35] it's going to a million um and so it's
[65:37] there is sort of Behavioral and
[65:39] psychological aspects to both sides of
[65:41] of the unit bias thing um and so I I I
[65:46] would be surprised if we move off of
[65:47] that anytime soon basically interesting
[65:51] I always had an different opinion on
[65:53] that uh I will just quickly explain
[65:55] because um I thought because of
[65:59] exchanges and we see actually some
[66:01] exchanges already doing that displaying
[66:03] it in SATs and usually you can switch
[66:05] around between SATs and Bitcoin but my
[66:08] thinking was like okay once we cross
[66:10] like a million before that I don't think
[66:12] it will anything it will happen but once
[66:14] we cross that million the people that
[66:16] enter into a Bitcoin wallet on like an
[66:20] exchange or something like that and they
[66:21] buy like I don't like 10,000 or like
[66:23] even $50,000 of Bitcoin if Bitcoin is at
[66:26] a million they have like zero point and
[66:29] z z like the number looks so small and
[66:32] that's why I thought like uh above a
[66:35] million exchanges will slowly start
[66:37] defaulting to satoshis just to give the
[66:40] user better a feeling of like oh see
[66:43] here you have you have a 200,000 satosi
[66:46] and not like 0.0 like that yeah it's a
[66:50] reasonable thought I also think there's
[66:52] probably um there's probably like a
[66:55] period of time where it's both right
[66:58] like it's not one or the other and
[66:59] there's sort of a transition period that
[67:01] could take many years uh where some
[67:05] people are are using a different
[67:06] standard and some others are not I think
[67:09] what I also come back to is like we kind
[67:11] of just need to do a better job on the
[67:13] education front like I I've joked about
[67:15] this in the past but like we need some
[67:17] PSAs in Bitcoin that are like there's
[67:19] only 21 million and another one is
[67:22] Bitcoin is uh divisible like you don't
[67:25] need to buy whole Bitcoin like there's
[67:27] still people who think you need to buy a
[67:29] whole Bitcoin which is unfortunate what
[67:32] what is a PSA sorry Public Service
[67:34] Announcement oh interesting Public
[67:37] Service announ yeah yes yeah it's the
[67:40] next thing right like uh if you display
[67:44] Sates uh do people don't buy it because
[67:47] they want to buy Bitcoin like right yeah
[67:49] ex some people don't get it maybe yeah
[67:51] that's that's a good point too it's it's
[67:54] like I think it's really because I I
[67:56] remember like one year ago uh um old
[68:00] friend of mine texted me a weird message
[68:03] I couldn't understand it he was like oh
[68:06] like I I bought Bitcoin but I'm not sure
[68:09] uh uh wh which one to buy which Bitcoin
[68:12] buy godh and I was like okay which which
[68:15] Bitcoin to buy like doesn't thing of
[68:16] like Bitcoin cash and and and and and
[68:19] and I said like oh like what what kind
[68:22] of options do you see right yeah what
[68:24] are you looking at what looking at and
[68:26] he's like that has like an orange one
[68:27] and a green one
[68:30] like so so I think uh uh we we really
[68:34] need uh like the the we we often are way
[68:38] too in the bubble and we have to hammer
[68:42] down those fundamentals of like it's
[68:45] Bitcoin not Bitcoin cash not Bitcoin
[68:48] Satoshi Vision not Bitcoin anything it's
[68:50] Bitcoin and Bitcoin only it's also not
[68:52] ethereum it's it's Bitcoin and then it's
[68:54] like yeah it's C with 21 million uh one
[68:57] Bitcoin can be 100 million Satoshi uh so
[69:01] like if you buy a Satoshi it also is a
[69:03] Bitcoin uh so like th those fundamentals
[69:07] that's why I also only recommend Bitcoin
[69:09] only stuff like exchanges and stuff like
[69:12] that it has to be Bitcoin only because
[69:13] then they cannot buy the wrong Bitcoin
[69:15] which happened in the past so we really
[69:18] need to have education is so underrated
[69:21] still uh even though bitcoiners are
[69:23] quite good in that and we really have to
[69:25] stick with the with with the fundamental
[69:28] bases yeah
[69:30] reallyree really cool um we have one
[69:32] question that I we asked that I asked
[69:35] each and every one of my guests and the
[69:37] question is what can we learn from you
[69:39] besides Bitcoin what can you learn from
[69:40] me besides Bitcoin I think um I think
[69:43] this is true of of uh various Folks at
[69:46] onramp but I think one thing we've tried
[69:48] to call less around is is finding people
[69:51] with expertise and background outside of
[69:53] Bitcoin and so that's sort of my career
[69:55] Journey that I walked through earlier is
[69:58] um you know I I have sort of this basis
[70:00] and this foundation in the traditional
[70:02] world and have made the jump to bitcoin
[70:04] over time and I think for what we're
[70:07] doing at on-ramp like that is
[70:08] hypercritical to have multiple people on
[70:11] the team not just myself have that
[70:14] expertise and background outside of
[70:15] Bitcoin because ultimately what we're
[70:17] trying to do at onramp is Bridge these
[70:20] worlds of traditional Finance um you
[70:23] know basically Fiat Capital that is
[70:26] going to sort of via asmosis you know
[70:29] flow into Bitcoin over time but there
[70:32] hasn't been a lot of companies that have
[70:33] done a great job of connecting those two
[70:35] worlds um and so I think part of what um
[70:39] you know folks can learn from me and and
[70:40] other folks in our team is how to make
[70:43] that connection and how to um you know
[70:46] because what that ultimately allows you
[70:47] to do is is kind of what we've been
[70:49] talking around you know education it
[70:51] allows you to socialize these ideas
[70:54] around Bitcoin and in more palatable way
[70:56] because I think one thing that often
[70:58] gets missed in you know people orange
[71:00] pilling folks or trying to get their
[71:02] friends and family to buy Bitcoin is
[71:04] like you really have to meet people
[71:06] where they are in terms of their
[71:08] preconceived notions their understanding
[71:10] of markets um their understanding of
[71:13] money and there's a there's a delicate
[71:15] balance between you
[71:18] know basically not being overly
[71:20] aggressive with someone and not you know
[71:23] telling people to have fun staying poor
[71:25] or that they need to put 100% of their
[71:27] assets into Bitcoin right now like
[71:29] there's a there's a much more delicate
[71:31] way to go about things and I think our
[71:33] ability at onramp to do that is a
[71:35] function of our expertise and background
[71:37] in the traditional World um and being
[71:39] able to sort of meet people where
[71:41] they're at and actually provide a bridge
[71:44] to this
[71:45] world uh that that's very I I I searched
[71:48] for one more thing and I want to show
[71:50] you this I don't know what what you
[71:52] think about that um there is the the the
[71:57] really nice movie actually uh around the
[72:01] founder uh the McDonald's movie oh yeah
[72:03] I've seen that and and you just look
[72:06] exactly like him
[72:09] like I haven't I haven't gotone that one
[72:11] before but I'll take it really like it's
[72:14] it's like that the whole time I have had
[72:16] to think about like how he uh what was
[72:18] his name and and now I search of like
[72:21] like you look excit like sry to bring it
[72:24] up but yeah it's like
[72:25] I it it triggered me the whole whole
[72:27] time in in the recording I'll take it
[72:31] I'll like that yeah he's the he's a
[72:33] great guy in in the movie that says like
[72:36] uh you don't make the money I don't know
[72:38] what the exact is you don't make the
[72:39] money with like the burger flipping you
[72:41] make the money with owning the real
[72:42] estate and having the business on top of
[72:44] that which was an amazing insight and
[72:46] there's some meme around that converted
[72:49] to bitcoin uh I think there's some
[72:51] really cool thing about that yeah but
[72:53] yeah thank you so much uh we have endro
[72:55] in the podcast where the previous guest
[72:57] is asking a question for the next guest
[72:59] without knowing who the next guest
[73:00] actually is uh and your question from
[73:03] the previous guest is if you had to
[73:04] choose just one thing what would be your
[73:07] number one life
[73:09] hack life hack
[73:12] uh that's
[73:14] tough um life hack is uh waking up early
[73:19] getting getting a jump on the day
[73:21] because I think that's it just allows
[73:23] you to get in a a good frame of mind
[73:26] uh whether it's you know getting a
[73:27] workout in in the morning or just you
[73:29] know being being up ahead of everyone
[73:31] else it just gives you it even if it's
[73:33] just mental or psychological you're like
[73:35] I got an extra hour on everybody else in
[73:36] the world right now um and so that's
[73:39] that's one thing I've tried to
[73:39] internalize over time is just get
[73:41] started early get started cranking and
[73:44] and that'll basically help you have a
[73:46] better day amazing when when do you
[73:48] stand
[73:49] up depends but early as possible I mean
[73:52] 600 7 a.m. around there I love that yeah
[73:56] I also stand up 6:30 usually every day
[73:59] uh it's it's funny because it's like uh
[74:01] like from a logical standpoint it
[74:03] shouldn't matter like when you work and
[74:05] when you sleep but psychological though
[74:08] but going early to bed and waking up
[74:10] early and starting like it's just a way
[74:12] better day like if if if a wake up at
[74:15] like 600 6:30 it's a better day uh
[74:19] compared to when I start the day at like
[74:20] 7:30 it's not like even an hour later
[74:23] makes all the difference at least for
[74:25] yeah really cool then thank you so much
