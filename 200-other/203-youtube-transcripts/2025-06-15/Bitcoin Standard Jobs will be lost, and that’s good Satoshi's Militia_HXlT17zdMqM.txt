[00:00] my job I hate to say it it's very driven
[00:02] by Fiat and if you follow the money it's
[00:04] like well where's this money coming from
[00:06] and is that sustainable it's large
[00:07] amounts of money based on taxes that are
[00:09] extracted in ways right now that if
[00:11] there was a Bitcoin standard I think
[00:13] largely would go away we we both work in
[00:15] these Fiat jobs we both work towards a
[00:17] Bitcoin standard and those ideals and
[00:19] it's like you know under a Bitcoin
[00:21] standard would we have our jobs probably
[00:23] not really starts with the money so much
[00:25] of this is rooted in the money and the
[00:27] systems of how that works and it
[00:29] trickles down into what we're seeing
[00:31] here whether it's an escape hatch or a
[00:33] great realignment however we see it
[00:35] playing out Bitcoin fixes this
[00:37] communities are healthier you don't need
[00:39] as many case workers you don't need as
[00:41] many police you don't need as many
[00:43] nannies going around fixing problem
[00:45] after problem after problem and you have
[00:47] this cycle of like we're just going to
[00:48] fix all these symptoms all the
[00:50] [Music]
[00:53] time we we should be uh Brave at at in
[00:57] some regard we should be coming out
[01:00] saying like oh I'm Robin S I'm for
[01:02] Bitcoin if you have questions come to me
[01:05] if you don't like it uh I don't care I
[01:10] think in a lot of people's Bitcoin
[01:11] Journey when you first start learning
[01:13] about it you don't have the confidence
[01:15] necessarily and and to this day I don't
[01:18] sometimes I feel like um gee on a
[01:21] certain topic like you get into I'll be
[01:23] learning or I'll be discussing a topic
[01:26] with somebody and somebody gets into
[01:27] like aspects of mining or other things
[01:31] and I lo I like man I don't know enough
[01:33] about this area or you don't always have
[01:35] all the confidence you would like to
[01:37] have when you are early into Bitcoin as
[01:39] well you're learning you're learning you
[01:41] get excited you hit these Peaks and you
[01:43] get um you can get sort of naively
[01:47] overconfident but then the more you
[01:48] learn you realize how much you don't
[01:50] know or if you're ever questioned about
[01:52] it or someone starts
[01:54] to um you know for me it can sometimes
[01:58] be family like so
[02:00] you know how much financially at risk
[02:03] could you be here and you have to like
[02:05] explain that and bridge that Gap and
[02:09] translate it for them like wherever
[02:11] they're at on their path like some
[02:12] people aren't going to understand a big
[02:14] picture with all that and um and it can
[02:17] be intimidating where it's like a test
[02:20] of faith at times like am I really all
[02:23] in or if if someone I care about who is
[02:26] anti- Bitcoin or you know who knows um
[02:29] starts to kind of ask hard questions or
[02:32] play Devil's Advocate or really you know
[02:35] try to you know push on
[02:38] you are you are you willing to stand up
[02:40] for that um with tactful friendly kind
[02:46] confidence um and if they judge you for
[02:49] it okay uh it's nothing
[02:52] personal um or someday you kind of
[02:54] figure someday you may understand but
[02:56] that's okay you don't have to know now
[03:00] and and if you don't like me for it now
[03:03] well that tells me more about you than
[03:06] me being humble and just learning what I
[03:08] can for me um and I and then I'll be
[03:11] happy to share as I can but I'm not
[03:14] pushing it I don't need you to know
[03:16] everything now I it took me years to
[03:18] kind of ease into my confidence and why
[03:23] it wasn't just oh I understand how it
[03:25] works but then but why bigger picture is
[03:29] this important and it it takes time
[03:33] so yeah it's interesting because when
[03:36] you actually look at um like there are
[03:38] two types of people who ask critical
[03:40] questions the ones that are genuine and
[03:43] really try to understand Bitcoin and the
[03:45] other ones that just try to like because
[03:48] they don't invest themselves they want
[03:50] to make others that do invest themselves
[03:53] look like fools and they're not genuine
[03:56] and they just want to they just
[03:58] basically want to convin me you that you
[04:00] did a bad job and uh I usually when
[04:06] someone is genuine and actually has
[04:07] questions and and I like uh that they
[04:11] are open to it then obviously I take
[04:14] sometimes even three four hours on an
[04:15] evening to actually explain it to them
[04:18] uh if someone is in genuine I'm like hey
[04:21] if you want to learn about Bitcoin I can
[04:23] answer your questions uh I'm not here to
[04:26] this uh to uh discuss or debate anything
[04:30] it's it's like you can go on the
[04:31] internet and learn everything uh you can
[04:33] come to me and learn everything uh but
[04:36] I'm not in a debate Club I have no
[04:38] interest in debating any anyone yeah and
[04:41] and that's why also also the reason
[04:43] because I don't invite on my podcast uh
[04:46] people onti Bitcoin and that's exactly
[04:49] for that reason I I want to
[04:51] explore uh thoughts and ideas uh and
[04:55] then there's someone on the podcast that
[04:57] is only a little bit in Bitcoin and more
[05:00] about gold and more about real estate I
[05:02] explore with them why they are so in in
[05:05] Gold like I had this podcast on we not
[05:08] only like I don't only invite Bitcoin
[05:10] Maxes I also invite other people and
[05:13] when I invite them I explore like why
[05:15] they are so in Gold why are they so in
[05:17] in real estate and try to figure out
[05:19] what and understand what they're doing
[05:21] and not debate why they should be all in
[05:24] in Bitcoin that's debates are really
[05:27] emotional they probably work really good
[05:29] online people like to watch debates and
[05:32] it's emotional and it's it's cool but I
[05:36] don't like to contribute to that I want
[05:38] to have podcasts where I figure out what
[05:41] is the guest speaking about and this is
[05:43] always my always my goal uh to give um
[05:46] the best Stage possible for my guest and
[05:49] figure out what they are about and why
[05:52] they are doing what they're doing that
[05:54] that that's basically my common goal
[05:56] with with all the guests and also with
[05:58] you Fritz and I'm looking forward to to
[06:00] today's
[06:01] one yeah I you know it's a common
[06:04] question to ask is sort of like what
[06:06] what was your orange pill or what was
[06:08] your Bitcoin path what I mean we're
[06:10] still on it but um I I find that
[06:14] interesting because people have
[06:15] meandered and and navigated their own
[06:17] path in different ways and every single
[06:20] person who is different in many ways has
[06:23] a different story to tell about that and
[06:26] um and it's not always I mean the pa the
[06:29] path is not always straightforward or
[06:30] easy at all and at one point you know
[06:32] some years ago I had hit this like early
[06:35] Peak Bitcoin Maxi excitement like I'm
[06:39] going to tell everyone about this that I
[06:41] know just like how cool it is how
[06:43] important it is and I was just I was
[06:45] needing people to know and then I
[06:48] quickly ran into with random people
[06:51] various reactions it runs the gamut
[06:53] people that I would care about that I
[06:55] think oh I bet you would like this or
[06:57] you know or this is important like say
[06:59] for the future or for family and when
[07:02] you get hit with concern or criticism I
[07:06] learned okay all the relationships to me
[07:09] are very important and I'm not going to
[07:11] like you know um judge people over their
[07:15] Bitcoin path because it's not
[07:17] straightforward um so I would
[07:19] just I'd had to step back and say I will
[07:23] always be interested and curious and
[07:26] willing to share but if someone else is
[07:28] not ready
[07:30] I completely just I let it go because
[07:33] they will know someday to come to me if
[07:36] they um you know understand enough or
[07:39] care or you know want to talk about it
[07:42] they may be ready someday and it doesn't
[07:44] have to be now um so I step back from
[07:46] being like I'm going to like just go
[07:48] around and evangelize everywhere I can
[07:50] and I'm I'm just going to be
[07:52] aggressively like all out um I I read
[07:56] people and if they're not ready I'm not
[07:59] going to like turn them off because it
[08:01] seems like a cult or something it's just
[08:03] like oh no it's cool no no big deal you
[08:06] know if you're ever curious let me know
[08:08] but uh and then I'll approach it from
[08:11] where they are interested or what their
[08:14] needs are and it may be like you said
[08:16] you have a a gueston that's more about
[08:18] land or gold or the politics or whatever
[08:22] and I can frame it for that and kind of
[08:26] guide it towards what I see as you know
[08:29] being pertinent and you never know
[08:31] everyone's different and uh but for me
[08:35] relationships are pretty primary you
[08:38] know I I'm I'm human I have
[08:40] relationships I'm not going to burn
[08:41] relationships over something that may
[08:45] not matter for them ever or too late or
[08:49] um or later it's fine it can be later
[08:52] the only exception that I make to that
[08:54] and I 100% agree with that the only
[08:56] exception that I make with that is when
[08:58] I see someone that really needs Bitcoin
[09:02] and I see someone that like would
[09:05] benefit tremendously from it I try a
[09:08] little bit harder uh to get the idea
[09:11] across and a little bit more often um I
[09:14] had it rarely but I met like uh uh uh
[09:19] some some like maybe two people in my
[09:21] life I'm like oh they they really need
[09:24] hope they they really need they are so
[09:26] frustrated with the financial system uh
[09:29] and it's it's kind of my obligation as a
[09:32] bitcoiner to at least show them
[09:35] something else because they only see
[09:37] this fat world and they kind of are
[09:39] almost depressed in this fat world and
[09:42] they're like they cannot look outside of
[09:44] it and they are really depressed how it
[09:46] works and uh just showing them that
[09:49] there's something else I saw like a
[09:52] small Sparkle in the eyes and it's it's
[09:54] fascinating to see like oh oh okay um
[09:58] actually pric is should uh go down
[10:01] because everything we're getting better
[10:03] in producing it and it's deflationary
[10:04] and and those those mind breaking things
[10:08] that we bitco know but for for for
[10:11] people that didn't do the research till
[10:13] now it's like wow it's like actually
[10:16] this makes sense if you actually sit
[10:18] down with them and explain it to them
[10:19] it's it's it's fascinating to see yeah
[10:22] time some time will go with like
[10:24] somebody who um I'd mentioned Bitcoin
[10:26] too and they push back and like oh yeah
[10:28] right okay whatever and I'm like okay
[10:31] and then later they might complain about
[10:33] the price of things or um the quality of
[10:36] things or just the politics about things
[10:39] and I'll be and I can I I I have no
[10:42] problem of saying you know for me I
[10:45] believe it really starts with the money
[10:48] so much of this is rooted in the money
[10:50] and the systems of how that works and it
[10:53] trickles down into what we're seeing
[10:55] here um and whether it's an Escape PCH
[10:58] or a great realignment however we see it
[11:01] playing out Bitcoin fixes this uh and
[11:05] I'll I'll kind of drop that seed every
[11:07] once in a while and like it connects
[11:10] with them again and maybe it triggers
[11:12] something so yeah totally absolutely
[11:16] yeah perfect then let's let's get
[11:17] started uh with with with with the the
[11:20] actual questions that I have with you
[11:23] but this was a a great pre-t talk um
[11:26] first of all like welcome to the uh
[11:28] Bitcoin podcast scene uh you you started
[11:32] the podcast and it's always great
[11:33] because I think we need more voices
[11:36] there are some people that say oh there
[11:37] already so many great podcasts and I'm
[11:39] like uh really no uh because we are
[11:42] still like how many people have Bitcoin
[11:44] 3% 4% 5% uh of the world maybe uh
[11:49] depending on how you count it maybe we
[11:51] get up to like 8 10% but this is like
[11:54] you have to count people in that are
[11:56] invested INB 500 and have it through
[11:58] Tesla or something like that uh then
[12:01] maybe more but uh most people don't have
[12:03] Bitcoin and even from those who have
[12:05] Bitcoin only a small percentage actually
[12:08] understand Bitcoin like just because you
[12:10] hold some Bitcoin doesn't mean you
[12:13] actually understand what the underlying
[12:14] asset is so we need more voices to
[12:17] explain Bitcoin and we need more voices
[12:19] to get more bit uh Bitcoin in and so uh
[12:22] I'm always thankful and and appreciate
[12:25] everyone that comes on the scene and
[12:26] actually gives their voice their name
[12:29] their identity to bitcoin I I love that
[12:32] so much uh my first question is right
[12:34] around that uh what did inspire you to
[12:36] start the podcast and and what's your
[12:38] what's your main goal with
[12:40] it yeah so you bring up a good point uh
[12:44] you know like you starting your podcast
[12:46] and it was it was another fresh voice um
[12:49] and how how quickly things can grow when
[12:52] the when the signal is clear and when
[12:53] the quality is there um and just you
[12:56] know you can have your mainstay go-tos
[12:59] but you know you don't want to get
[13:00] Tunnel Vision on this stuff and you
[13:02] never know what kind of fresh ideas or
[13:04] new people might be out there doing
[13:05] different stuff and how how it
[13:07] integrates Grassroots all over the
[13:10] planet and so I feel like a lot of
[13:13] people probably feel a similar or have a
[13:17] similar experience when they start
[13:18] getting into Bitcoin and you could go
[13:21] back to like certain early days I mean
[13:24] you you see these funny things from you
[13:26] know 2013 or 12
[13:29] um and to today where people have this
[13:33] jux toos or this this weird double
[13:36] feeling where it's like I am so late
[13:39] it's I'm late if only I could have been
[13:41] earlier and at the same time we're also
[13:45] still early so it's like I'm I I'm late
[13:49] but it's also early and as I just kept
[13:52] studying Bitcoin and getting more um
[13:55] aware and and interested in it and and
[13:58] and fully
[13:59] understanding it in the
[14:01] future um I realized I I listen to
[14:04] podcasts for several years just taking
[14:07] it in taking it in and you start to get
[14:08] familiar with uh the the Main Stays the
[14:12] quality podcasts that are out there and
[14:14] there were there's
[14:16] many and I was like you know I don't
[14:18] have a background in traditional Finance
[14:21] um I I do have a background in computer
[14:23] science and technology and so I'm good
[14:26] at that but it's just I don't work in
[14:28] that Realm steadily so short of running
[14:31] a Bitcoin node and playing with that or
[14:32] getting lightning started and playing
[14:34] with that I can do little things but I'm
[14:35] just I'm no genius here I'm no genius
[14:39] there what am I going to contribute um
[14:42] but at the same time I felt this Burning
[14:46] sort of need to do something like I want
[14:49] to not just for catharsis but for my own
[14:52] learning and for my own sharing and
[14:54] feeling like doing something is so much
[14:58] better than just feeling like well kind
[15:00] of that loser think mindset of well
[15:02] other people are already doing it I'll
[15:04] let them do it and like I missed out I'm
[15:08] too late no you can keep doing it or you
[15:12] can do something with your flavor um and
[15:15] when I started to think about it for a
[15:16] while I just thought um okay I um I have
[15:21] a background in computer science and
[15:22] some tech that later shifted into law
[15:26] enforcement and I work in law
[15:27] enforcement areas Criminal Justice
[15:30] now and my flavor I'm an American um and
[15:35] I'm a proud American even as I know that
[15:38] I I criticize my government I somewhat
[15:41] separate Government powers that exist
[15:44] and how that rols out today with the
[15:47] roots and the themes of what created
[15:49] America and just how fascinating and
[15:52] kind of unique that was and that to this
[15:55] day it relates to things that people go
[15:58] through in the world to you know
[16:01] establish their sense of privacy their
[16:04] fundamental human rights how do you even
[16:06] fight for that how do you win against a
[16:09] large power
[16:10] structure um or if you feel oppressed or
[16:13] whatever how do how do Grassroots
[16:15] communities band together and work
[16:17] together and over time defeat like an
[16:20] Empire I just find that stuff
[16:22] interesting and I thought I started to
[16:25] see these parallels there with um
[16:29] initially just American history because
[16:31] that's what I grew up in what I'm
[16:32] familiar with what I learned growing up
[16:34] as a kid and there were parallels as I
[16:38] learned Bitcoin with that sort
[16:40] of um fundamental human Spirit rights to
[16:44] Freedom life liberty property that kind
[16:47] of stuff and with Bitcoin as Bitcoin
[16:50] would say be you know a regulatory
[16:52] attempts or criticisms propaganda
[16:55] misunderstanding
[16:57] whatever uh that bitco has had to um
[17:01] fight and grow and be Grassroots and
[17:05] distributed and stand up for itself and
[17:09] proof of work so um to and as it's grown
[17:13] and become Global so I started seeing
[17:15] those kinds of parallels and I just I
[17:17] was like you know there are a lot of
[17:19] very specific things that kind of
[17:21] connect um about that where you know um
[17:25] I I I was like you know the uh the
[17:29] Declaration of
[17:30] Independence um was a document that uh
[17:34] you know founding fathers in America put
[17:36] together and told King George hey enough
[17:39] is enough with this stuff we are going
[17:42] to do something different and in a way
[17:45] that I mean well certainly it took a lot
[17:46] of courage and it might have seemed a
[17:49] little crazy and it and not that it was
[17:52] a new idea to want to be free from a
[17:54] king say but um it it was a big bold um
[18:00] document that that was issued forth and
[18:03] said hey here it is and then satoshi's
[18:05] white paper you know to for Satoshi to
[18:08] write his white paper and put it out
[18:10] there lay out the problem and a solution
[18:15] and I so there was like that and um
[18:19] early Founding Fathers as compared to
[18:22] the all the various early Bitcoin
[18:24] developers uh uh the Federalists versus
[18:27] Anti-Federalists concerns that went on
[18:29] in early America over how much power the
[18:32] central government should have versus
[18:33] the states or communities um with like
[18:36] the Block Wars you know how big should
[18:38] the Block Wars uh the block size be um
[18:42] how distributed should it be what's the
[18:43] risk of centralizing power in this space
[18:46] you know after two terms as president
[18:49] George Washington stepped down and made
[18:51] it clear that you know no President
[18:53] should be king and people were like no
[18:56] stay you know you are you know you're
[18:58] the just be president for as long as
[19:00] your alive because that was their
[19:02] thinking you know we uh we we would love
[19:05] to have a king you know you're not a
[19:06] king but we love
[19:08] Kings um
[19:10] Satoshi after working and you know being
[19:13] becoming seen as potentially too much of
[19:16] an authority he just walked away and so
[19:19] there were those kinds of parallels that
[19:20] I was seeing through all that and then I
[19:23] thought you know I think what my cont
[19:24] contribution can be to this is me being
[19:28] American
[19:29] loving America's Roots being a patriot
[19:32] acknowledging the
[19:34] modern um criticisms of America
[19:38] legitimately that um you know you could
[19:41] say that America does in the world um
[19:43] various things that have occurred over
[19:45] the last you know whatever you know 50
[19:46] years 100 years there are things to
[19:49] criticize about government structures
[19:51] but the roots of that human Spirit are
[19:54] all there and I wanted to contribute
[19:56] something that compared that um if you
[20:00] if you love where America came from and
[20:02] what those values were and
[20:05] are how do that how does that relate to
[20:07] bitcoin without making it too like
[20:09] obvious like hey this is that and this
[20:11] is that there's a general parallel
[20:14] spirit that connects in these ways that
[20:16] we're all going through and I thought
[20:18] that's interesting I'm not going to make
[20:20] it too obvious but I'll make videos
[20:23] about that and I'll make videos about
[20:24] this and then you can draw your own
[20:27] conclusions but it boils down to that
[20:29] sense of um like a cypherpunk Manifesto
[20:33] hey we want to be free we want to have
[20:36] life liberty rights to
[20:38] property and it's revolutionary or does
[20:41] it have to be revolutionary maybe we
[20:43] need to make it revolutionary to make it
[20:45] clear that this is important and if
[20:48] you're going to fight us hey we're not
[20:50] going away or or really what are you
[20:52] going to
[20:53] do and and for a lot of people that are
[20:56] understanding Bitcoin people can easily
[20:59] kind of dabble in it but if if things
[21:01] get weird if there's you know whether
[21:02] it's propaganda or certain regulation or
[21:04] whatever but Bitcoin still works Bitcoin
[21:08] is still distributed and hashed and not
[21:10] beholden to you know if you don't want
[21:13] particular
[21:15] authorities um are you are you do you
[21:19] value those ideas well enough to stand
[21:22] up for them to fight for them to not you
[21:26] know shrink away from it because well
[21:28] geez well maybe other people don't like
[21:31] it you know the founding fathers didn't
[21:33] do that they at at at severe risk to
[21:36] their lives and livelihoods and many of
[21:38] them lost a lot they did stand up and
[21:41] fight and it wasn't a huge proportion of
[21:44] Americans it was you could say it was
[21:46] somewhat of a minority of Americans at
[21:48] the time initially that were willing to
[21:50] put it on the line and fight for that
[21:53] and then ultimately it's like well how
[21:54] did how did these colonies with new
[21:57] developing economy
[21:59] and you could say spread out distributed
[22:01] but well hashed proof of work
[22:04] communities defeat the British
[22:07] Empire you wouldn't have thought that
[22:09] was easily possible and yet the British
[22:12] arm Empire decided at a certain point
[22:15] you know what are we going to just keep
[22:16] fighting this we're going broke and they
[22:19] so we not only did they walk away but we
[22:22] also fought back and defeated that so
[22:25] that spirit is there and that's
[22:27] partially what drives the idea of
[22:28] satoshi's militia the the channel That I
[22:31] make and the brand that I have satoshi's
[22:34] militias that play on um you know if you
[22:37] imagine fighting for Bitcoin
[22:39] evangelizing Bitcoin being all
[22:42] in um but not like satoshi's Army in in
[22:47] one sense the idea of army is for me an
[22:50] army is almost too centralized uh what's
[22:52] the distributed version of what worked
[22:54] in the colonies it was like militias
[22:56] town to town and uh Village to Village
[22:59] and in the woods fade you know attack
[23:02] and fade it's distributed and it's not
[23:05] attackable the Native Americans when
[23:07] when the immigrants early on you know
[23:09] Colonists came to America they learned a
[23:11] lot from the Native Americans who lived
[23:13] on the land and were integrated with
[23:15] what works here and there was a long
[23:18] hard integration process and it's
[23:20] ongoing that's a hard part of American
[23:23] history that to this day we do have to
[23:25] reconcile and that uh in certain senses
[23:29] is is ongoing but uh America's learned a
[23:33] lot about living you know with and for
[23:37] their land in a distributed fashion and
[23:40] being sustainable in that sense and so
[23:42] an Empire saying hey you know we we want
[23:46] a slice of that we want control over
[23:48] that we're going to tell you how to do
[23:50] that and the colonists and the natives
[23:52] could
[23:53] say
[23:55] no or how are you going to do that like
[23:57] what are you going to you going to
[23:58] occupy us all the time and ultimately
[24:01] the British government uh Empire they
[24:03] couldn't uh and and uh and I think that
[24:08] is quite often the way it works in
[24:11] history where um a king or an Empire can
[24:14] only occupy so much all the time so when
[24:17] it's very well distributed and well
[24:19] hashed and proof of
[24:20] work um you can't control that it's just
[24:23] it's a force of nature it's organic it's
[24:26] not going away it'd be like we have a
[24:29] whole bunch of troops and we're going to
[24:30] walk out into the ocean at the beach and
[24:33] we're going to hold the tide back can't
[24:36] do it the the Tide's coming in folks so
[24:39] yeah get wet if you want but you're not
[24:41] going to stop the tide it's and one
[24:46] example of the US Patriot history or one
[24:50] one thing that like stands out for you
[24:53] that is really good comparable with
[24:55] Bitcoin like the the most comparable
[24:58] thing or the most important thing uh
[25:00] that you see a real poignant one for me
[25:03] like I mentioned
[25:05] was see one of the most amazing things
[25:07] about Bitcoin and what made it work was
[25:10] Satoshi walking
[25:12] away the incredible Genius of that and
[25:16] and to remain undocked from the very
[25:19] beginning his operational
[25:21] security building this amazing thing and
[25:24] it was starting to become clear this is
[25:27] important and amazing and people are
[25:28] jumping on it and make and you know and
[25:31] it was so early it was like oh my
[25:33] goodness this is
[25:35] big and he was willing at you know when
[25:38] he realized it's in good hands and he
[25:41] just really um without much announcement
[25:44] or any Fanfare whatsoever he just simply
[25:47] walked away he was like Hey you know
[25:49] here's here's access to the website
[25:51] here's the keys to this um it's in good
[25:54] hands and then where'd he go uh that
[25:57] with compared to George Washington being
[26:00] president and just walking away saying
[26:03] no it's time for an election I'm going
[26:05] to go back to my uh Ranch and grow some
[26:09] tobacco and Brew some uh distill some
[26:11] whiskey um now you know he was a public
[26:14] figure and had a life but um it was that
[26:18] same sense uh that that was a poignant
[26:20] piece for me um another one when the
[26:25] when the Revolutionary War the American
[26:28] Revolutionary War started troops had
[26:30] been occupying areas all over the you
[26:33] know coastal areas and Inland for many
[26:35] years and it was sort of grinding away
[26:38] on people who lived there with increased
[26:41] taxes increased
[26:43] occupations um the Boston Massacre that
[26:46] was that was some years before the war
[26:48] started but it just started to um you
[26:52] know rub on the colonists in ways where
[26:54] they were really like when do we fight
[26:56] back how do we fight back when
[26:59] it's like the water getting hotter like
[27:00] when does the frog jump out of the pot
[27:02] it's like we're just getting kind of
[27:03] used to this more and more it's more and
[27:06] more when is enough is when is enough
[27:09] enough and so um the B the Battle of
[27:12] Lexington and
[27:14] Concord uh started um April 19th um
[27:22] 1770 oh what year was that um
[27:26] 1776 and they um uh the British troops
[27:30] had heard that the American colonists
[27:33] were starting to accumulate arms and
[27:35] storing lots of gunpowder in these
[27:37] storage
[27:39] silos uh you know west of Boston and
[27:44] they were like okay we need to put a
[27:46] stop to that these Americans have an
[27:48] escape hatch here or they could fight us
[27:50] more significantly instead of just
[27:51] Farmers with some muskets they have some
[27:54] cannons and some Gunpowder and that boy
[27:57] that could be um that could be a battle
[28:00] so the British marched West from Boston
[28:02] and were going to seize that and the
[28:05] militias got
[28:06] together and put up a fight just
[28:08] basically no you're you're it stops here
[28:11] it stops at the
[28:12] bridge and so when the British got um uh
[28:16] when the first shot was fired they call
[28:19] it the shot HT around the
[28:21] world um the war started effectively
[28:25] that was the start of the war some
[28:26] people didn't know that this is the war
[28:28] yet but that that's what started it and
[28:31] it didn't stop till it was
[28:32] over and so the the shot heard around
[28:35] the world I could compare to um you know
[28:38] whether it's the Genesis block issued or
[28:41] the first transaction made with
[28:43] hinny um it was sort of like okay you
[28:45] have this thing going on and then that
[28:49] Genesis block goes out and it's the
[28:51] start of the entire time chain um or
[28:55] that first transaction goes to hinny for
[28:57] what
[28:58] you know as money or um as as a means of
[29:02] value to anything it had no like value
[29:05] at the time but it was like that first
[29:07] shot heard around the world where like
[29:09] we just did a
[29:10] transaction uh Bitcoin works you can do
[29:13] this and it was working um so that's
[29:16] another one too the the shot hurt around
[29:18] the world the when the Revolutionary War
[29:20] started and then from not just white
[29:23] paper but the actual first set of blocks
[29:26] and transactions it just sort of sent
[29:28] the shot out there like this is running
[29:30] running
[29:31] Bitcoin that's a good comparison that I
[29:34] like to think about uh I love that and I
[29:37] also think that as you said in the
[29:38] beginning um that the anonymity of
[29:42] satosi Nakamoto is extremely important
[29:44] that he walked away and this project
[29:46] lived on and is growing ever since um do
[29:50] you see it as a risk I mean first of all
[29:53] like I don't think sat nakot will ever
[29:55] come back um I put it as a really low
[29:58] probability he's probably either dead or
[30:03] just like I I don't know where he is or
[30:06] if he's alive or if he's even a man or a
[30:08] woman or a group of it uh but but the
[30:13] the chances of him never returning uh
[30:16] getting greater and greater with every
[30:18] day uh and it's like almost 99% or
[30:21] something like that maybe even higher um
[30:23] but it's still a possibility that he
[30:26] comes back uh do you see a
[30:29] risk when he would come back because all
[30:32] of the sudden the
[30:33] Bitcoin um opponents have a face and the
[30:38] physical party to attack like because
[30:40] then it's not about Bitcoin it's all of
[30:42] all of the sudden about oh satosi
[30:44] nakamoto's character and satosi Nakamoto
[30:48] uh he wants to get rich and he wants to
[30:50] plug us or like do you see that as a
[30:53] risk
[30:54] I not so much and I have some
[30:58] I don't know if it's Unique and I I want
[31:00] to be careful with what I say because I
[31:01] have some particular ideas about Satoshi
[31:04] Nakamoto and I I I don't want to I
[31:06] almost don't want to describe my
[31:08] opinions on that too strongly
[31:11] because I I wouldn't want to say
[31:13] anything that would like say Doc
[31:17] Satoshi I personally have specific ideas
[31:21] about the early American Cipher punks
[31:25] and the cryptography work going on who
[31:28] is involved in that the short list of
[31:31] people involved with that and who sat
[31:34] Satoshi is I believe and and so this is
[31:39] I'm not I'm not saying that we should
[31:41] know or that we need to know or that we
[31:43] it's anything to pursue because the
[31:45] doxine part is important to protect um
[31:49] sort of like just just well was it
[31:52] yesterday or whatever business weekly
[31:54] released an article about um a developer
[31:59] who helped basically start
[32:02] Noster and doxing um doxing the
[32:06] developer of Noster and trying to make
[32:09] it a hitpiece about who this person is
[32:11] and blah blah blah not that it matters I
[32:13] think it's it's not going to matter
[32:14] eventually anyway I think docine Satoshi
[32:17] it's natural when you start learning
[32:19] about Bitcoin there's a question people
[32:21] run into where you you're excited and
[32:25] Satoshi represents this godhead Bitcoin
[32:29] and and there's a mystery there who who
[32:31] is he where' he go he he's sitting on
[32:34] all this Bitcoin what does that mean
[32:35] what if he shows up and does starts
[32:37] acting weird or sells it or um I think
[32:40] pricewise Satoshi could do anything he
[32:43] wants with his
[32:44] Bitcoin uh bitcoin's good bitcoin's good
[32:48] for it soosi could like sell it or
[32:50] whatever um wouldn't matter maybe it
[32:53] affects the price temporarily U maybe
[32:55] it's more Bitcoin for me to be able to
[32:56] buy okay whatever
[32:58] the the price of Bitcoin and Fiat I
[33:00] don't worry so much about the idea as
[33:03] far as using that as propaganda that oh
[33:06] say we knew who Satoshi
[33:08] was um I believe and this is not this is
[33:13] not um to make any reference to the idea
[33:16] that Bitcoin is not completely a
[33:20] global human owned and run system now it
[33:25] doesn't matter who Satoshi is at this
[33:27] Point Bitcoin is fine that said and it's
[33:31] and when I say so with my brand
[33:33] satoshi's militia there's nothing about
[33:35] satoshi's militia that's like co-opting
[33:37] Bitcoin that Bitcoin is American or that
[33:41] Bitcoin should be American it's simply
[33:43] that uh uh if America is to remain
[33:47] strong America should be in on bitcoin
[33:49] Americans should be Pro Bitcoin and in
[33:52] on bitcoin uh Bitcoin is good for
[33:54] America just as Bitcoin is good for Any
[33:56] Nation or any person person or if you
[33:59] know without Nations it doesn't matter
[34:01] Bitcoin is good for people I'm
[34:03] pro-american I'm Pro Bitcoin I think
[34:06] bitcoin's good for America America's
[34:08] good for Bitcoin that's not to say that
[34:10] America should you know can exert any
[34:13] influence over Bitcoin or should or what
[34:16] I know a lot of things like the ETFs and
[34:17] other things sometimes things start or
[34:19] looked through the lens of an American
[34:22] approach or oh you know what's the SEC
[34:25] doing what's you know what's um you know
[34:28] what's the American government going to
[34:30] do about stuff it matters and it doesn't
[34:33] matter in a way longterm it kind of
[34:35] doesn't matter but um but Bitcoin I want
[34:39] America to be good for Bitcoin and vice
[34:41] versa I do believe
[34:44] Satoshi is an American and that he's
[34:47] alive I also believe that his Integrity
[34:50] is so superb that he will not ever come
[34:56] back and I hope is never doxed those are
[34:59] just my personal opinions I have reasons
[35:01] for those I wouldn't want to get into
[35:03] too much detail because I I just would
[35:05] not want people
[35:07] to um out of just sheer interest dox
[35:11] him um there's a natural path people go
[35:15] into is when that you start learning
[35:16] about Bitcoin and you start thinking
[35:18] well who is Satoshi I want to know you
[35:20] do some research and maybe there are
[35:22] knowable things about that there are
[35:24] some knowable intelligence gathering
[35:27] things you could do about that that
[35:29] might lead you to know better who he
[35:32] is um and I when you learn when you
[35:38] start learning that stuff or when you
[35:40] think you do I think it's good that it's
[35:41] complicated and nebulous and distracted
[35:43] and that it's hard to
[35:45] know because it just it it shouldn't
[35:48] matter I think it's very it's it's
[35:50] naturally fascinating history uh and
[35:54] someday maybe we all
[35:56] know uh just through you
[35:59] know access to data and history and over
[36:02] time it's it's a knowable
[36:04] fact it's still too early to want to go
[36:07] there so when you get excited about
[36:09] Bitcoin you want to know about Satoshi
[36:11] maybe you think you know and you may
[36:12] legitimately have some solid evidence
[36:14] that you do as I you know think I do um
[36:18] I wanted to I I started to tell close
[36:21] friends like hey I think I know some you
[36:22] know here's what I think and then I I
[36:25] put a clamp on that to say
[36:28] no I don't talk about it because it's
[36:31] easily distracting people focus on the
[36:35] godhead type figure versus the movement
[36:38] um it's a natural human thing people do
[36:41] people get into a movement whether it's
[36:43] a you know it could be something
[36:44] religious or a political movement but
[36:47] people naturally as human animals we
[36:49] want to place a face and a name to what
[36:52] that is or a person talking about it
[36:55] it's it's this thing and then you can
[36:57] attack a whole movement because you
[36:59] character assassinate a person who's
[37:01] kind of leading part of the charge it's
[37:04] that kind of stuff is not good for
[37:05] Bitcoin and so I just don't want to add
[37:08] to that I also think that the government
[37:13] or uh mainstream Media or others could
[37:15] flag youate around that like hey did you
[37:18] know Satoshi Nakamoto blah blah blah
[37:19] blah blah um okay um it might turn some
[37:24] people off from Bitcoin temporarily but
[37:26] ultimately it doesn't matter cuz Bitcoin
[37:27] continues to run and work as um you know
[37:31] like an asset and uh whether it's you
[37:34] know just sound everything so not to
[37:37] ramble on about that but yes I have
[37:40] specific ideas about Satoshi I think
[37:43] it's still important not to go down a
[37:45] historical road too early about who he
[37:48] is and what he could do or doxing him it
[37:52] would be
[37:54] unhelpful um the I don't judge People's
[37:58] Natural interest in who Satoshi
[38:00] is but I think it's antithetical to the
[38:04] movement and it's kind of a a Fiat
[38:07] thinking it's kind of like um hey uh hey
[38:12] you know who Satoshi is let's talk about
[38:13] that that's exciting it's it's kind of
[38:15] fat thinking it's kind of like no no it
[38:16] doesn't matter really when you truly
[38:18] understand Bitcoin we are all Satoshi
[38:20] Nakamoto that's the point we are all at
[38:22] this point Satoshi Nakamoto if you are
[38:24] listening to this podcast you might be
[38:26] wondering what is actually the setup
[38:28] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[38:31] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[38:33] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[38:35] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[38:37] right way let's focus on the first thing
[38:40] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[38:42] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[38:44] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[38:46] an exchange that has an own token or
[38:48] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[38:50] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[38:54] for me the best partner for that and now
[38:57] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[38:59] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[39:01] a self custody solution where you
[39:04] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[39:07] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[39:11] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[39:13] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[39:15] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[39:20] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[39:22] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[39:25] have one last thing before we get back
[39:27] to the video I'm really passionate about
[39:29] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[39:32] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[39:34] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[39:38] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[39:41] conference in whole of Europe for all
[39:43] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[39:45] this place in June for all europees it's
[39:48] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[39:51] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[39:53] to come I will do interviews there and I
[39:55] would love to meet you all all there use
[39:58] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[40:01] discounts and use the links down in the
[40:03] description yeah this is actually the
[40:05] reason also because this is the do
[40:07] Spirit uh why I open Li and my whole
[40:11] podcast so everyone can take anything
[40:15] from that podcast and use it in whatever
[40:18] way they think it is good because uh I
[40:22] don't see that I own this podcast I mean
[40:25] technically I own it like technically I
[40:27] can enforce the rules and don't copy me
[40:30] and stuff like that but I'm I have no
[40:32] interest in that because people can just
[40:35] take something maybe my guest said
[40:36] something really interesting maybe I
[40:38] said something interesting they can clip
[40:40] that and distribute it uh and if it gets
[40:43] a good reach it's good for my podcast
[40:45] it's good for the guest and it's good
[40:47] for him and it's good for Bitcoin like
[40:49] why should I put a stop on that and
[40:51] YouTube has a tool where you can see uh
[40:55] who used your podcast to what extent
[40:58] like I can actually see oh uh he used
[41:01] 50% of my video 60% of my video what I
[41:03] do is I go to their YouTube channel and
[41:06] write a comment and saying thank you for
[41:10] Distributing uh the idea uh and also
[41:14] when they credit me I'm like thank you
[41:16] for crediting me you don't even have to
[41:17] do that like you like just just taking
[41:21] my podcast and and putting it out in the
[41:23] world uh that's that's something really
[41:25] great uh and so I encourage everybody
[41:28] like even when someone viewing that you
[41:31] see some clip of mine just take it and
[41:34] distribute it wherever you want to it's
[41:36] it's marketing for me so it's even good
[41:38] thing for me I don't know why other
[41:40] people are like oh he took my my clip
[41:43] and now I like be be be blessed be good
[41:47] about it like I love that and and this
[41:49] is kind of the satous Spirit uh that I'm
[41:54] uh right now I'm not doing it anymore
[41:56] but in in the early days of Twitter I
[41:58] just took a meme from someone and was
[42:00] like giving my own thoughts to it and I
[42:02] forgot to Credit One or maybe even
[42:05] sometimes I credit the wrong person
[42:07] they're like so angry about it right and
[42:10] it's it's kind of understandable from a
[42:11] human nature
[42:13] perspective but I just was like okay I
[42:16] will only use my own stuff like I
[42:18] everything that I produce is now
[42:19] original I don't even take memes from
[42:21] someone else now uh because I want to
[42:24] respectful be respectful but in the
[42:26] other hand
[42:27] everyone can take like whatever you want
[42:30] and if if you really want to take
[42:32] something from a podcast and you are
[42:35] because I put a logo on the top right
[42:36] corner if you don't want the uh logo and
[42:38] you have a good reason for that email me
[42:41] I will email you the raw file like I
[42:42] don't care use it make something with it
[42:45] and that's the that's the true Spirit of
[42:47] satosi Nakamoto I feel like yeah I think
[42:50] the true Spirit of Satoshi it's it's a
[42:53] it's a realignment to you know good
[42:55] quality Community networking and
[42:57] interaction Grassroots relationships and
[43:00] um you know in America we have you know
[43:02] copyright law a lot of you know Nations
[43:05] have copyright law um and when you grow
[43:08] up and there's kind and it's to protect
[43:10] business and people's legitimate you
[43:11] know Creations that they worked on and
[43:14] want to protect and I get it with the
[43:16] internet and other things and just so
[43:18] much moving all the time in this
[43:19] information age um I I think it's a it's
[43:23] good to have that Spirit of Satoshi
[43:25] where like um if you build something
[43:28] that you want to keep yours and you do
[43:30] you do things specifically to kind of
[43:32] make that clear um or add your logo or
[43:35] whatever you know okay you know good but
[43:39] memes are a funny space in this where
[43:41] you know I love I love various memes and
[43:44] I'll just I'll save them and I'll save
[43:45] them and there's times where it's like I
[43:46] didn't make it or you've seen it a
[43:48] hundred times or different different
[43:49] versions of something but we're just
[43:51] sharing them we're like oh this is you
[43:53] know this applies here and the meme
[43:56] space is a way where man I tell you I I
[43:59] steal them I'll reshare them if I if if
[44:02] there's somebody to attribute or if
[44:03] there's a logo on it I try to just you
[44:05] know leave that okay yeah maybe this is
[44:07] somebody's I didn't make it but I'm
[44:09] sharing their I'm sharing their art and
[44:12] it adds to that Spirit of sharing
[44:14] collaboration hey steal my stuff reuse
[44:17] my stuff use the brand it's I'm not
[44:19] possessive I'm not territorial because
[44:21] that's Fiat that's Fiat thinking not
[44:24] that there's not a time and a place to
[44:25] protect private property people have
[44:27] private property that may be theirs and
[44:29] they should you know have their you know
[44:31] have their reward for their
[44:33] work uh but in uh Noster was an
[44:36] interesting thing for this too where
[44:38] when I use Noster a lot and the value
[44:40] for Value stuff where you like you know
[44:43] you can like something you can zap them
[44:44] some stats uh some SATs um or I I post
[44:48] something that somebody likes and they
[44:50] zap me and you're you're providing value
[44:55] for value and saying you know hey thank
[44:57] you and we're sharing and whether I get
[44:59] some SATs or I send some out we're we're
[45:02] appreciating each other and sharing is
[45:04] more about the ideas and the vision and
[45:06] the knowledge and that we're move we're
[45:07] all in this together and it's not about
[45:10] well I made this and I'm going to keep
[45:11] it and you want some I'm going to sell
[45:12] it to you um there are times and places
[45:16] for that to occur but so much of the
[45:19] space is so collaborative and
[45:21] distributed it's like hey let's just do
[45:22] as much as we can every way we can and
[45:24] let's share it together
[45:27] H yeah I love it and an artist should be
[45:30] always be thankful when someone else
[45:33] shares the art no matter how he does it
[45:36] it's like B big thing yeah um but let's
[45:40] come back to to the topic um you are
[45:42] also working in in in in your fear job
[45:45] as a law law
[45:47] enforcement um yeah which is really
[45:49] interesting for me when I talk about uh
[45:52] Bitcoin and how uh Nations can be like
[45:57] how the world could be nationless how
[46:00] and bitcoiners are also sometimes
[46:02] talking about this idea how Bitcoin will
[46:05] completely change how we all interact
[46:08] with each other uh and how we setting
[46:10] rules and how we enforcing those rules
[46:13] uh like with private uh courts with
[46:17] private law enforcement maybe with like
[46:20] uh other ideas that is uh different than
[46:23] we are used to it now um with you
[46:26] working in in law enforcement how do you
[46:28] envision that the the future of law
[46:30] enforcement the future of Nations the
[46:32] future of police it's a really big topic
[46:36] area and I don't see any of this what
[46:40] what my friend and I uh you had him on
[46:42] your podcast fairly recently too Daniel
[46:45] white he's my compadre in a lot of my
[46:47] work we do together on satoshi's
[46:48] malicious podcasts and he's writing a
[46:51] book called The Great realignment he
[46:53] helped me understand that I think the
[46:55] way Bitcoin is going to change society
[47:00] in all the M multifaceted ways all over
[47:04] the place is that it's going to be a
[47:06] slow steady realignment what what
[47:09] Daniel's book is called the Great
[47:11] realignment some time ago I when I when
[47:14] I really started learning Bitcoin and
[47:16] seeing its capabilities and I think it's
[47:18] easy to kind of IM imagine it's sort of
[47:20] an easy black and white way to view it
[47:22] as like oh my gosh this is going to
[47:24] change the world it's going to blow up
[47:25] and stuff's going to just break down and
[47:27] fall apart it's going to be like a real
[47:29] sudden hard shift and and that could be
[47:32] a fight or there's people that'll never
[47:34] get it and will have fun staying poor
[47:35] blah blah blah I I kind of get that I
[47:38] mean yes there is that potential in ways
[47:40] not broadly but there's going to be
[47:42] microcosms of just system
[47:45] failure um you know people the the the
[47:48] zombie Trope uh societal breakdown
[47:51] people can kind of Imagine like well
[47:53] what would I do um Society falls apart I
[47:56] got I got my Arsenal and my food and I
[48:00] could survive or bitcoin's my escape
[48:02] hatch and all this stuff Daniel and I
[48:05] feel more and more that it's not going
[48:06] to be something so drastic there will be
[48:08] just a slow steady propagation of what
[48:12] works better and maybe a slow steady and
[48:16] fits and starts you know pops of
[48:18] failures bank failures political
[48:21] failures that also will just basically
[48:23] what doesn't work so well is going to
[48:25] diminish in value and strength and that
[48:30] that great realignment will just sort of
[48:32] seep its way in starting with money and
[48:36] individual treasuries and then State
[48:39] treasuries and retirements and then n
[48:41] National treasuries and you know banking
[48:43] system stuff it's going to creep its way
[48:46] in creep its way in and then as we
[48:48] experience it today as the money drives
[48:50] the you know social systems we
[48:53] experience it's going to seep in there
[48:55] as well it's Bitcoin for me one of the
[48:58] biggest things it did for me was related
[49:01] to time preference I didn't realize how
[49:04] much time preference affected my
[49:07] day-to-day thinking and my my my Fiat
[49:10] thinking and my goals in life and so
[49:13] when you start like slowing down your
[49:14] time preference and prioritizing a lot
[49:16] of things you start looking differently
[49:19] on things like justice um I have friends
[49:22] who are very
[49:24] libertarian um staunchly libertarian or
[49:26] others that are like that andap
[49:30] libertarian I have others that are sort
[49:32] of reformed libertarian or sort of
[49:33] criticized libertarianism and say
[49:36] well um yeah in aspects libertarian
[49:40] values are going to start to happen but
[49:44] are we looking at decades or a century
[49:47] from now that like Nations go away um I
[49:51] think it's very possible that we always
[49:54] have Nations we always have kind of
[49:58] certain lines drawn in certain ways
[50:00] different
[50:01] languages that we have different
[50:03] cultures that ban together for reasons
[50:06] with a name and a title and boundaries
[50:10] because it does work in a lot of ways
[50:13] for a lot of reasons and it's how we
[50:15] just kind of keep things organized and
[50:17] get our minds around how we interact in
[50:20] large groups of people so I could say I
[50:23] never see that going away uh
[50:25] collaborative uh you know
[50:27] collaterally I also see for the same
[50:29] reason that governments that help run
[50:31] these nations aren't going to just go
[50:33] away they will you know what we're going
[50:35] to have Nations we're going to have
[50:36] governments that work for those Nations
[50:39] and for the people the way they do that
[50:42] will start to change over time both
[50:44] through what simply works like what's
[50:46] sustainable financially or sustainable
[50:50] through people's tolerance of their
[50:53] rights um but also driven by you know
[50:56] individual in those nations with
[50:57] different
[50:59] expectations uh different uh different
[51:02] empowerments they're empowered perhaps
[51:04] by things like Bitcoin or their
[51:05] perceptions on time preference they're
[51:08] going to in some areas they're going to
[51:09] say enough is enough here but also don't
[51:13] stop doing this over here we appreciate
[51:16] that so keep doing that so what works
[51:18] better will continue to grow what
[51:21] doesn't work well will have to go away
[51:24] Bitcoin is going to help drive that and
[51:26] it's going to be a flywheel that grows
[51:28] and grows and grows in momentum and then
[51:31] you can't and you can't stop it
[51:33] governments and nations are going to
[51:34] have to get on board to operate under
[51:37] that
[51:38] Paradigm if they're going to survive if
[51:40] they don't they either go broke or they
[51:43] have like a a Revolt from the people I I
[51:47] think
[51:48] eventually I don't think people
[51:50] necessarily want conflict or gravitate
[51:51] to conflict I think generally people are
[51:53] sort of risk averse and want to get
[51:55] along
[51:57] and I think if the money is fixed the
[51:59] systems that enforce that are going to
[52:02] align themselves in ways that simply
[52:05] just start working better and aren't a
[52:07] big
[52:08] Calamity um now are we not going to have
[52:11] a Calamity I don't know it I mean it
[52:13] could be that yeah things really
[52:15] collapse and the government is like
[52:16] desperate and says we have a cbdc and
[52:19] you got to get on it there's a new
[52:20] dollar you have to register get an
[52:22] account you're going to get free money
[52:24] it's enforced bitcoin's illegal yada y y
[52:27] y I can see that happening for a
[52:31] temporary you know fight but it can't be
[52:35] it's not going to work long term now
[52:37] when it comes to my job and when you
[52:40] think of law
[52:41] enforcement um when you think of like
[52:43] the
[52:43] police the police are part of the
[52:46] government they're not paid short of um
[52:50] public funds which are extracted from
[52:52] taxes if the tax system is was to if the
[52:56] money was to get fixed and that were to
[52:59] affect the way the tax system can work
[53:02] and the way governments can collect
[53:04] money and the way their Fiat is failing
[53:07] and how they can even spend that Fiat
[53:09] governments are going to have to make
[53:11] hard decisions about what they
[53:13] prioritize how much money they're
[53:15] spending for all kinds of everything
[53:17] some of that is the military law
[53:20] enforcement control structures obviously
[53:23] criminal justice uh legal enforcement
[53:26] they're going to have to start doing
[53:28] that in sustainable ways so it's not
[53:30] going to be this extra like you know
[53:33] we're going to just invade that Nation
[53:35] because we can't and the only way we can
[53:37] afford that is to steal their stuff um
[53:40] regardless of any excuse or reason they
[53:42] make about it to justify that um that's
[53:45] going to be unsustainable you can't do
[53:47] that uh now policing is
[53:52] very dispersed in jurisdiction by
[53:55] jurisdiction
[53:57] it's easy to see cases of police work
[53:59] where you you get a random story from
[54:02] somewhere where something bad happened I
[54:05] mean my dad just yesterday told me about
[54:07] a story hey did you hear about this
[54:09] thing in Little Rock Arkansas and this
[54:11] police uh no knock warrant search thing
[54:14] that happened and a guy got shot I'm
[54:16] like what and you know bad things happen
[54:20] you hear about them and whether it's
[54:22] whether it's the the CIA the FBI state
[54:25] troopers at some level
[54:26] County deputies local Municipal Police
[54:30] folks on the beat they are human and
[54:33] they're doing a job that they're paid to
[54:35] do they're probably not going to do that
[54:37] job unless they're
[54:38] paid um and large organizations that do
[54:41] that can be corrupt they get corrupted
[54:45] there are ones that exist today that are
[54:47] corrupt they get popped they run into
[54:49] trouble people are tolerating less of
[54:51] that bull
[54:52] crap and so they're they're realigning
[54:56] uh today just in an information age they
[54:58] have to respond to the demands of the
[55:00] people and work ultimately they serve
[55:02] the people and the public interest if
[55:05] they don't they get called on it um
[55:07] maybe not as quickly as people like you
[55:08] know the wheel of Justice grinds very
[55:10] slowly and it and people sometimes want
[55:13] the fix now so they they want to do they
[55:16] want to take drastic measures to fix
[55:18] that it is improving it's just very slow
[55:21] because it's a very large dispersed
[55:23] system and it happens Community to
[55:24] community
[55:26] but from the top down it's going to have
[55:28] to realign in some
[55:30] ways to a financial system that pays for
[55:33] that so if the money is fixed the nature
[55:36] of the mechanisms that fund things like
[55:38] say policing will also have to align
[55:41] with what's
[55:42] sustainable it may be that the services
[55:45] that the people get from that are
[55:50] different if if we were under a Bitcoin
[55:52] standard you know what would policing
[55:53] look like it's really hard to Fathom but
[55:56] it it may very well be
[55:58] that um people are served in ways that
[56:03] they're more willing to actually fund or
[56:06] invest in more personally instead of you
[56:11] simply get taxes extracted and it's just
[56:13] going to come down on you the way it is
[56:15] I think there there'll be more of an
[56:17] integration with what's sustainable and
[56:19] supported by the people and paid for how
[56:24] by the people it's hard for to imagine
[56:26] how that'll look a libertarian view on
[56:29] that might be that hey um it could
[56:32] operate privately and it could be people
[56:36] will fund or invest in what they want if
[56:40] it's worth it to
[56:41] them that may or may not work in every
[56:44] Community it may be that poor
[56:47] disenfranchised communities that don't
[56:49] have a good you know Network going for
[56:53] them can't afford the services they'd
[56:55] like to to have and in other in other
[56:58] places where it's doing well like a
[56:59] community organiz an organized Community
[57:03] can is is is uh connected and has a
[57:07] culture willing to recognize that hey
[57:10] you know what it's worth having some
[57:12] security in our community so it's worth
[57:15] paying so much for that and sustaining
[57:17] that for good reasons because you don't
[57:19] want bullies going around stealing your
[57:22] stuff or you know or you know responding
[57:25] to crisis somebody gets hurt you need
[57:27] people that that know how to take care
[57:28] of that and are they going to always do
[57:30] that for
[57:31] free not necessarily I tell you if if
[57:36] you know if um if power structures or
[57:38] just you know police if if you stop
[57:40] paying them they're not going to go to
[57:43] work so if you're going to have police
[57:45] you got to pay them if you're going to
[57:46] pay them you got to do that on a on a
[57:49] money system that is sustainable I think
[57:53] largely it can be but visualizing what
[57:56] that looks like under Bitcoin standard
[57:58] honestly I'm really not sure because I
[58:00] think it's very
[58:01] complicated um I think that's kind of
[58:04] the Humanity's next
[58:07] big um challenge not challenge but you
[58:11] know where we're graduating to is
[58:15] reconciling and navigating how we take
[58:19] these next
[58:20] steps as humans on the planet having
[58:23] these structures or service
[58:26] programs support for each other that are
[58:29] good for people that people need and
[58:32] want um and that we want to take care of
[58:35] each other naturally but then how do you
[58:37] deal with problems in a way that the
[58:40] people want and that you can also
[58:42] sustain sustain financially under good
[58:45] money we're used to a welfare state or a
[58:48] Fiat State and so you just kind of think
[58:50] well the government will fix that or
[58:52] somebody needs to do something about
[58:53] that why why don't the police do
[58:55] something why doesn't the government
[58:57] come in and take control um it may be
[59:03] that you know under when there's
[59:05] emergencies or there's problems we are
[59:07] so used to just millions of dollars
[59:09] coming down in the form of support from
[59:11] a higher Central Authority we're kind of
[59:13] used to that if that were to go away in
[59:16] a lot of ways we're left more to our own
[59:20] distributed
[59:21] resources and then it can be very it can
[59:25] seem un fair cuz people in one community
[59:27] may not get that done well enough and
[59:31] others they're
[59:32] fine um I think it's more doable in an
[59:35] information age where we have good
[59:37] communication and a lot of networking
[59:39] among communities I think
[59:41] how power structures or or large
[59:44] organizations do that under sound money
[59:47] is not completely clear right now and
[59:50] and that's or maybe it is to some people
[59:53] Daniel and I have talked a lot about
[59:55] this in our podcasts and I struggle I
[59:59] get stuck in a Fiat brain sometimes and
[60:01] I struggle with knowing how exactly
[60:03] that'll look and I just don't think
[60:04] it'll be very
[60:06] consistent all over all over the nation
[60:09] or all over the the planet um we may see
[60:13] a lot of sort of in a way you'd call it
[60:15] disparity you're going to see some
[60:16] disparity where we're having this
[60:19] realignment but it's happening better in
[60:21] some places and less well in others and
[60:24] you can criticize that I I just think
[60:25] that's the natural Oran organic process
[60:28] of the great
[60:30] realignment Someday I'm an optimist but
[60:32] I think that someday we will figure this
[60:34] stuff out it'll get more consistent
[60:37] there will be standards to follow we
[60:39] have good standards now it's just how do
[60:41] we maintain those
[60:43] sustainably um that's not
[60:45] Fiat um it is a different
[60:48] Paradigm uh I I think that a lot of
[60:51] things that I do in my job my job I hate
[60:53] to say it it's very driven by Fiat uh a
[60:56] large chunks of my budget um and I and
[61:00] I'm the director of a fairly small
[61:02] organization that supervises people in
[61:04] our community and a huge proportion I
[61:08] mean it's all tax dollars obviously but
[61:09] a huge proportion of it is grant money
[61:12] that is beholden to things that the
[61:15] state wants um and if you follow the
[61:18] money it's like well where's this money
[61:20] coming from and is that sustainable it's
[61:23] large amounts of money based on taxes
[61:25] that are extracted ways right now that
[61:27] if there was a Bitcoin standard I think
[61:29] largely would go
[61:30] away so my job would go away so if my
[61:35] job in my department goes away how does
[61:38] that look for the community if people
[61:39] are not doing well in the community you
[61:41] have people who have mental health
[61:44] problems have drug addictions are
[61:46] criminal thinking they're going to do
[61:48] bad
[61:49] [ __ ] how do we respond to that as a
[61:51] community and um and can communities
[61:54] grapple with that without say that guy
[61:59] or that team of people who know what to
[62:02] do and are say hey you know what there
[62:04] are times and places where we take away
[62:06] your rights you're going to be arrested
[62:08] you're going to go to
[62:10] jail it's like hey those are my human
[62:12] rights you can't do that or if I can
[62:14] beat you I'll win and you can't do that
[62:16] to me and you got bullies fighting
[62:18] bullies um I think there's still a way
[62:20] to have a system that we have now that's
[62:22] supported by a community that's funded
[62:24] by sound money but that happens
[62:27] organically it may not it just may have
[62:29] to be efficient and responsive to the
[62:32] people it can't just exist because it
[62:34] exists and next year's budget's got to
[62:36] be better than last year's because well
[62:38] we're just growing we're doing more just
[62:40] because I think it's going to have to be
[62:42] nimble and
[62:44] responsive and if if there aren't
[62:46] problems you're not there if there's a
[62:48] problem then you have to muster and
[62:49] shift gears it's a different mindset
[62:52] about how that works um my job can be
[62:56] pretty bureaucratic at times um it like
[63:00] you say you get a government job and you
[63:03] you got a stable a stable secure job uh
[63:07] you're going to get your retirement your
[63:09] pension under this
[63:11] Fiat um that thinking around how
[63:15] government works may have to get Nimble
[63:18] and
[63:20] responsive and not just exist because
[63:22] it's just existing it's going to have to
[63:25] adjust
[63:26] to the needs of the
[63:28] people um that doesn't really answer the
[63:30] question but it's a it is a complicated
[63:32] question yeah and it's a
[63:35] extremely broad topic I think we can
[63:38] like talk probably like hours and hours
[63:41] just on on just on that one there was so
[63:43] many interesting um thoughts in there
[63:46] that you'd explained and uh it's really
[63:48] interesting also how how you think about
[63:50] that and it's it's the thought is
[63:53] becoming clearer and clearer I asked
[63:54] that question or similar questions quite
[63:56] often in the podcast uh and almost
[64:00] everyone agrees that there will become
[64:04] some change and almost everyone says
[64:08] it's unclear to them how exactly this
[64:10] looks because it's just impossible to
[64:13] answer uh but time will tell and in
[64:16] general I think a Bitcoin standard will
[64:18] be much better than a fat standard in
[64:21] every way uh but we will have an
[64:25] interesting transitioning time there
[64:28] because once we figured out law
[64:29] enforcement on a Bitcoin standard it
[64:31] will be great but this might take some
[64:34] time from this Downs slow of the field
[64:37] system to the uprise of Bitcoin or sound
[64:39] money system there will be a transition
[64:41] time where not everything is is perfect
[64:45] and and I think this we should accept
[64:47] that that it's it's okay to grow uh it's
[64:51] a growing pain is a real thing like I'm
[64:53] 2 m tall when I was small I had a lot of
[64:56] growing pain in all my joints because of
[64:59] that uh but it doesn't mean that we
[65:02] should not grow and this is I think the
[65:04] the best comparison I I could make with
[65:08] that yeah we're going to have to figure
[65:10] it out and and and it's not
[65:12] straightforward I
[65:14] think the idea of Bitcoin standard kind
[65:17] of makes now from a sound money point of
[65:19] view yeah it'll be a
[65:21] standard from how that integrates in
[65:24] society
[65:25] it's not going to be standard everywhere
[65:27] you go it's going to be different in
[65:28] every Community every Community is
[65:30] different every community's needs
[65:32] different and it it's going to be a lot
[65:34] more Grassroots and the roots are going
[65:36] to be wide and distributed and it yeah
[65:39] like I said it may be um it may be hard
[65:42] in some areas to sort it out and in
[65:45] every Community it's going to be like oh
[65:46] we have a new challenge we have a new
[65:47] problem oh this emergency happened how
[65:50] do we how do we do that how do we rally
[65:52] together in new and different ways I
[65:54] think we're quite capable because we've
[65:56] done it many times in history um you
[65:59] know well so for example the satoshi's
[66:01] militia brand you know the the colonies
[66:04] were way distributed argued amongst
[66:06] themselves didn't disagree every
[66:08] Community was different the South to the
[66:10] north the coastlines to Inland Farmers
[66:14] versus the uh fishermen it was very
[66:18] diverse and when the but when the
[66:20] British Empire came or there was some
[66:21] problem it was like okay despite all
[66:23] differences here something came up
[66:26] we can come together come to Common
[66:28] Ground what do we need to do for all of
[66:30] us together and they figured it out
[66:32] we've we faced it with um you know
[66:36] public health concerns or um you know
[66:38] certain attacks on things I I think
[66:41] people in every nation are capable
[66:43] naturally
[66:44] of um coming together I think there's an
[66:47] in there's an inherent interest in
[66:50] taking care of others it's easy to be
[66:52] cynical in this day and age of like well
[66:54] I got my good luck to you um people just
[66:59] naturally are really not that greedy
[67:01] even even as kids uh you can readily
[67:05] learn to share and play together I think
[67:10] we all do it naturally and I think
[67:12] adults today when there's a problem um
[67:16] people will swoop in to help if they can
[67:18] and I think that natural Pro that that
[67:21] natural inclination is going to help us
[67:24] all get through hard times times times
[67:27] you know so times could get hard if you
[67:30] will because they're going to be very
[67:31] different or when problems occur we
[67:33] don't know how to navigate them as well
[67:35] the same way we did
[67:37] before we're going to have to figure it
[67:39] out so it may be clumsy at times but
[67:41] we're also going to figure it out and
[67:43] it's going to grow organically and I I
[67:45] feel hope
[67:47] there in my mind it's kind of funny
[67:49] Daniel and I were talking at our last
[67:51] podcast about we we both work in these
[67:53] Fiat jobs we both work towards a Bitcoin
[67:57] standard and those ideals and it's like
[68:00] you know under a Bitcoin standard would
[68:02] we have our
[68:04] jobs probably not so meanwhile you're
[68:07] working a job I you know I need to get
[68:09] paid I have a family I I and it's it's
[68:11] good work we do good work it's just
[68:14] under the Fiat Paradigm if if their
[68:16] great realignment were to happen kind of
[68:18] quickly what would that mean for me it
[68:21] could be that you know I got to figure
[68:22] out a different way that I work I got to
[68:25] do something something different I can't
[68:26] just hold on to the way it's always been
[68:28] because it doesn't work that way the
[68:30] money's not there or whatever um
[68:33] whatever comes new hey I'm there for it
[68:36] I'm capable I'll do it uh I think people
[68:39] will adjust some not as well and that's
[68:42] going to be you're going to see some you
[68:45] know you're going to see tragedies that
[68:47] happen or people that have hardship I
[68:49] also think you're going to see a lot of
[68:51] success as over time we figure it out
[68:54] and it becomes more organic and
[68:56] distributed absolutely and it's it's a I
[69:00] think it's a great way to to get in our
[69:02] end routine of the podcast uh great
[69:03] ending point here uh we have an end
[69:06] routine in the podcast uh that is now
[69:08] two parts uh first part is a question of
[69:11] mind that I ask now uh every podcast
[69:14] every bitcoiner um because I think
[69:17] bitcoiners are such interesting persons
[69:20] and the second part is then the end
[69:21] routine that I have since the beginning
[69:23] where the previous guest ask a question
[69:24] for the next guest
[69:26] um the first question that comes from me
[69:28] and I'm really passionate about is what
[69:31] are you currently passionate about
[69:33] besides Bitcoin and I asked this
[69:34] question because uh I think Bitcoin is
[69:37] are interesting people and we can learn
[69:39] from each other uh outside of the normal
[69:43] topics about Bitcoin sound money history
[69:45] how will this go and so so like what are
[69:47] you currently passionate about uh what
[69:49] are you learning what are you doing what
[69:51] is is there anything that stands out to
[69:53] you one one core area area of my life
[69:56] right now really it's it's my family and
[70:00] so I have I have three older boys and
[70:03] then a little more recently I have a
[70:05] 2-year-old daughter and so I've raised
[70:08] boys for many many years and one's off
[70:11] to college another one's heading that
[70:12] way um and I'm used to raising boys what
[70:17] I've been learning more recently in my
[70:20] life is raising a young
[70:22] daughter and I've just been fascinated
[70:25] how how in various ways she's just
[70:28] inherently different than her older
[70:30] brothers and her personality her
[70:33] interests and then also me as a dad I've
[70:36] I'm a better parent now because I'm I'm
[70:38] a more experienced parent you know just
[70:41] from years of doing it and my approach
[70:44] to her with a new child has been more
[70:50] emotionally wrapped up in her well-being
[70:54] um not that I wasn't with the boy I I
[70:56] love all my boys and we have great
[70:57] relationships and there's something
[70:59] about being a father to a young daughter
[71:03] um or just as a you know having a
[71:06] daughter there's something different
[71:08] about it that I found really fascinating
[71:10] naturally I just I feel very emotionally
[71:13] connected and and the love I feel for
[71:15] her is interesting and very caring and I
[71:17] feel very protective of her and um I've
[71:21] been learning new new skills as a a a
[71:25] parent of a young one as I age that are
[71:29] um I found fascinating just like wow
[71:32] this is different so my family is a big
[71:35] priority of mine so being a good dad is
[71:37] a is a big area of interest of mine um
[71:40] now collaterally I like Tech I like all
[71:42] kinds of
[71:43] tech um so I've always been fascinated
[71:46] in keeping up with um you know for
[71:49] example like where vehicles are going um
[71:53] things about like self-driving Tesla
[71:57] um uh SpaceX and the rocket uh efforts
[72:01] going on and where we're going in that
[72:04] direction I am very fascinated about
[72:07] what humans potential is in the space of
[72:10] Technology integrating into our lives
[72:13] whether it's day-to-day travel or
[72:16] someday exploring elsewhere what I I I
[72:21] um I have a drone license uh pilot
[72:25] license from the FAA to fly drones so
[72:28] I've um I'm not a I'm not a aircraft
[72:32] pilot but I'll I'll fly drones and I
[72:35] like making videos of you know I'll take
[72:37] my drone with us on vacations and then
[72:39] I'll fly it down the beach or around the
[72:41] mountain and um I like piloting drones
[72:44] that's an area of interest of mine I'll
[72:45] make videos and just fun landscape
[72:48] Bird's ey view of things um so that's a
[72:52] nerdy interest area of mine making video
[72:54] work um so aside from my family and then
[72:58] technology generally I like to think big
[73:00] and kind of futuristic about where we're
[73:02] all going like even 100 years from now
[73:04] what what will things look like I like
[73:06] thinking about that and and then I apply
[73:10] it to making my own videos around
[73:12] Bitcoin and flying my drone and making
[73:14] videos that are like flyover type videos
[73:19] and raising my family studying Bitcoin
[73:22] and
[73:23] then Monday through Friday daytime
[73:25] sometimes after hours calls I work in
[73:28] criminal justice and so like it's a
[73:31] different world I go to my day job and I
[73:34] work in this area and grind away and
[73:36] save lives and then I go home and take
[73:39] care of my family forget about work try
[73:42] to separate work from life and um play
[73:47] in my tech hobby
[73:49] space I love it it's really great I
[73:52] think there's a there's a balance to it
[73:54] and and I love what you're doing um to
[73:56] the end routine of the the previous
[73:58] guest uh the question is uh to you what
[74:01] problem does Bitcoin solve for the
[74:04] industry you currently working in I mean
[74:07] we kind of really touched on that whole
[74:08] topic already but do you have any
[74:11] anything to add uh to that question I
[74:13] could go deep with this because I think
[74:16] the long-term view on what Bitcoin
[74:19] fixes goes deep into society and the
[74:23] problems that I
[74:25] help manage and try to
[74:28] stop are deeply rooted human fundamental
[74:33] human problems it's part of the human
[74:35] condition it can connect with drug
[74:37] addiction like I mentioned drug
[74:39] addiction mental health criminal
[74:41] thinking broken families people with
[74:45] trauma for various reasons people hurt
[74:48] people and then hurt people hurt people
[74:52] and it can be a cycle there's a lot of
[74:54] trauma in societal decline out there and
[74:56] there's you know homelessness all that
[74:58] stuff drug addiction uh people who are
[75:02] houseless they they start having mental
[75:04] health concerns the medications and the
[75:07] technology and the incarceration and all
[75:09] these systems we have now to try to fix
[75:11] that work to varying degrees but in
[75:15] imperfectly and you can throw a lot of
[75:17] money at that to try to fix it but
[75:21] um change is hard and change is slow
[75:25] there's no real fix to this these are
[75:27] these are problems that I think humans
[75:28] will always have it's sort of like you
[75:31] know is Bitcoin going to stop conflict
[75:33] or stop um traumatic events or or is
[75:38] everyone just going to get along no we
[75:40] people are going to fight people are
[75:41] going to have problems people are going
[75:42] to make mistakes and make bad decisions
[75:45] uh greed can set in and people can be
[75:47] criminal all this stuff what Bitcoin
[75:50] realigns for society is healthier people
[75:55] it's a healthier mindset if your goals
[75:56] are
[75:58] long-term uh it's it's um you know if
[76:02] Human Society goals are longterm and
[76:05] investing forward and not just shortterm
[76:08] like get your fix now or get your money
[76:10] now buy your stuff now it aligns Society
[76:13] in healthier ways if you align all of
[76:16] society in a healthier
[76:18] way the symptoms of the root problem the
[76:22] symptoms start getting better too you
[76:25] have less people drifting to shortterm
[76:28] gains of
[76:30] crime drugs or alcohol uh
[76:34] gambling uh hurting other
[76:37] people not that people won't make
[76:39] mistakes but people are going to start
[76:41] stop thinking so short term because they
[76:44] understand a longer term picture that is
[76:46] going to reduce crime it's going to
[76:48] reduce conflict it's going to reduce the
[76:52] outcomes of that which are all the
[76:55] troubles you see with people so in that
[76:57] regard I think what it fixes for my job
[76:59] in the long term is that communities are
[77:03] healthier and if communities are
[77:04] healthier you don't need as many case
[77:07] workers you don't need as many police
[77:09] you don't need as many nannies going
[77:11] around fixing problem after problem
[77:13] after problem and you have this cycle of
[77:15] like we're just going to fix all these
[77:16] symptoms all the time and we can't stop
[77:19] people
[77:20] from the groundup will all start doing
[77:24] better
[77:25] and then people will start having less
[77:28] of those
[77:29] problems and it's just a generalized
[77:32] societal health I I look at law
[77:34] enforcement and criminal justice the the
[77:37] work we try to do is often in the public
[77:40] health Spectrum it's not a moral
[77:43] question of right and wrong and good and
[77:45] bad yeah there are bad things in the
[77:48] world and people do bad things but the
[77:50] approach to that from my view is often a
[77:53] public health approach
[77:55] it's not just fixing symptoms and oh you
[77:58] did bad we're going to lock you away or
[78:00] we're going to arrest you or you're
[78:01] going to be
[78:02] punished why did they do that the root
[78:04] causes of that are a public health thing
[78:07] it can come from trauma it can come from
[78:09] addiction it can come from mental health
[78:10] it can come from lack of housing if you
[78:13] can
[78:13] solve the things that contribute to uh
[78:18] homelessness or drug addiction or mental
[78:20] health problems or people's greed and
[78:23] suffering and criminality
[78:25] you make my job easier and Bitcoin fixes
[78:28] that yeah it basically gets really deep
[78:32] into the in the human behavior even in
[78:34] the in the human uh incentives uh it's
[78:38] it's it's interesting the guest that I
[78:40] had yesterday on uh said Bitcoin fixes
[78:44] and solves for Human Behavior Uh and
[78:47] it's it's resonated a lot with with his
[78:50] message around around that but yeah I I
[78:53] love the the talk with you uh it was
[78:55] really really cool uh it was really
[78:57] insightful uh thank you for for being on
[79:00] uh and thank you for for being a guest
[79:01] on on my
[79:03] show Before I Let You Go um where can
[79:06] people find you where can people ask you
[79:08] questions where can people reach out to
[79:11] you I'm largely so I'm I'm on Noster a
[79:14] lot you can uh my npb's on my Twitter my
[79:17] ex account you can see it there and on
[79:20] my YouTube channel satoshi's militia all
[79:23] one word satoshi's militia
[79:25] you can find me on X Twitter YouTube I'm
[79:28] on Noster and um and my npb's on my
[79:31] Twitter you can probably search me on
[79:33] Nostra if you know how for satoshi's
[79:35] militia I think I'm my probably the only
[79:38] Bitcoin militia out there um so that's
[79:41] probably the best way to find me that
[79:42] way and I I put out regular YouTube
[79:44] channels uh YouTube videos on my channel
[79:48] um uh I largely Orient my Twitter
[79:51] activity to my videos and occasionally
[79:54] something poignant but um you know when
[79:57] you have a daytime Fiat job I'm fitting
[79:59] in what I do with my videos you know
[80:02] after hours at times um so I'm not
[80:04] really active all the time on either
[80:06] Noster or Twitter but my videos are
[80:09] every few days new videos rolling out my
[80:11] Satoshi milicia videos and podcasts we
[80:13] do every week uh amazing uh love it then
[80:18] uh thank you for being on and for
[80:19] everyone listening and watching uh I'll
[80:21] be back tomorrow with another episode
[80:23] bye-bye awesome thank
[80:24] [Music]
