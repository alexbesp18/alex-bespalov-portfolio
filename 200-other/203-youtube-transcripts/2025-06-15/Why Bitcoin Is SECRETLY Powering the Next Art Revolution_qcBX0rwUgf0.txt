[00:00] I want more artists to know that there's
[00:02] this type of option on the table it's
[00:05] all about negotiating and it's all about
[00:07] thinking outside the box the more and
[00:10] more I got smarter the more and more I
[00:12] realized that all roads led to bitcoin
[00:14] if I really wanted to preserve my wealth
[00:15] and be in a riskof type of situation the
[00:18] least riskiest thing I could own was
[00:19] Bitcoin what's the most important asset
[00:22] in the music industry and it's um the
[00:25] ability to collect the royalties every
[00:26] month that that's kind of the reason why
[00:29] labels still exist CU they're they're
[00:30] still scouting talent and they're
[00:32] finding talent that has yet to be
[00:34] discovered where they're going to pour
[00:35] capital in and take the this immense
[00:37] risk right and they also exist because
[00:39] they're going after these trendy DIY
[00:42] type of artists but giving them maybe
[00:44] even better deals than the ones that are
[00:47] just starting out when I read the
[00:48] Bitcoin standard one of the points that
[00:51] the author makes in that book is how
[00:53] when we were on the gold standard some
[00:54] of the best art was commissioned and and
[00:56] again I see the same thing happening
[00:58] with Bitcoin
[00:59] [Music]
[01:04] you propos something like strategic
[01:06] Bitcoin reserve for the for record
[01:08] labels and stuff like that yeah no
[01:10] exactly um so yeah a little bit about me
[01:13] um I was a producer most of my life
[01:16] still am go by Mikey the magician as a
[01:18] producer and I worked with a lot of
[01:21] really cool underground acts so like the
[01:22] suicide boys puya
[01:25] Ramirez a bunch of like emerging
[01:27] underground acts that became big Lil
[01:29] peep XX XX tentasion those types of
[01:31] people and um just growing up around the
[01:35] music industry kind of getting a knack
[01:37] for the business of it I eventually sold
[01:40] a portion of my music catalog you know
[01:43] this this sale gave me a bunch of cash
[01:46] that I had no idea what to do with and
[01:49] so I started studying a lot right trying
[01:51] to get smarter like with this pile of
[01:54] cash this is like
[01:56] 2022 um and so it's a life-changing
[01:58] amount of money I have a lot of cash
[02:00] don't know what to do with it and the
[02:04] best idea I have is
[02:06] bonds uh real estate uh watches art
[02:11] index funds so I buy a multif family
[02:16] property thinking that's going to be a
[02:18] passive income I buy you know an IND I
[02:21] get an index fund open up a nice little
[02:23] index fund by bonds that's crazy that I
[02:28] even you know that was an option for me
[02:29] at that time um and so I sold my music
[02:34] catalog and this was the best idea I
[02:35] could come up with and as I started
[02:38] studying Bitcoin a little bit more you
[02:40] know watching
[02:42] podcast um and getting into just Bitcoin
[02:47] in general I decided to you know start
[02:50] with a a small allocation in a Bitcoin
[02:52] like okay let me let me put some money
[02:53] into Bitcoin I kind of understand it and
[02:56] then I keep studying Bitcoin and I'm
[02:59] like wait
[03:00] why do I have my money in bonds again
[03:03] like why why why am I invested in bonds
[03:06] so I get rid of my bonds buy more
[03:08] Bitcoin and you know the multifam real
[03:11] estate unit that I had I was getting
[03:14] sued on one side the other side I was
[03:16] trying to Airbnb out turns out that a
[03:19] lot of the stuff got stolen from the
[03:21] Airbnb it was too much why am I worrying
[03:24] about tiles why am I worrying about you
[03:26] know making sure I get a good review it
[03:28] should not be my f Focus it's supposed
[03:30] to be a passive
[03:32] investment and so I sold the multif
[03:35] family unit and bought more Bitcoin
[03:37] right I was just forget about it got rid
[03:39] of it um and then as you keep studying
[03:43] into Bitcoin you obviously stumbl upon
[03:46] the Bitcoin Ambassador Michael sailor so
[03:48] stumbling across your podcast Michael
[03:50] sailor and then I was like huh I don't
[03:52] have any exposure to micro strategy that
[03:55] seems like something I should get into
[03:58] so I sold all the stocks that I had in
[03:59] my self-directed account and I bought
[04:02] micro strategy and more Bitcoin and and
[04:06] so essentially what happened was I had
[04:08] this music catalog I sold I sold it
[04:12] because I was trying to and and I had
[04:13] this you know pile of cash and I was
[04:16] trying to preserve my
[04:17] wealth and the more and more I got
[04:20] smarter the more and more I realized
[04:22] that all roads led to bitcoin eventually
[04:24] if I really wanted to preserve my wealth
[04:25] and be in a riskof type of situation the
[04:29] least riskiest thing I could own was
[04:30] Bitcoin and and that's what happened so
[04:32] my journey from selling my music catalog
[04:35] to buying all this crap in between led
[04:38] me to getting smarter and I basically
[04:41] traded a portion of my music for Bitcoin
[04:44] in the end and just add it's like the
[04:47] the the discovery story of someone
[04:50] getting Bitcoin getting educating in
[04:52] Bitcoin on all of this like like where
[04:54] else would I park my money like even if
[04:56] it rips to a million like what would I
[04:58] sell it for like what would I otherwise
[05:01] do with that Bitcoin no exactly exactly
[05:04] that's that was the Dilemma that I was
[05:06] in trying to preserve my wealth and I
[05:08] mean I made some mistakes that I I
[05:11] bought art thinking that was going to be
[05:13] a cool way to diversify and I couldn't
[05:15] get rid of that so I look at I look at
[05:18] this uh this art in my home all the time
[05:20] and I'm like wow okay you know it could
[05:23] have been a lot more Bitcoin but um it's
[05:25] cool to look at and um and yeah I parted
[05:28] with my art you know parted with my art
[05:31] um and I realized I I could trade it for
[05:34] an asset that com compound way quicker
[05:36] than the art that I could make would
[05:38] could compound right because with music
[05:41] um when you release a song typically if
[05:44] you have a decent enough fan base um you
[05:47] know the streams go up over time like
[05:50] within the few first few months but then
[05:52] after first few months it starts
[05:54] decaying and so there's this huge Decay
[05:56] rate with
[05:58] music um and with Bitcoin it's the
[06:01] complete opposite right there's this
[06:02] compounding effect year-over-year you
[06:05] know what's the kager like 30 to
[06:07] 40% and so I I I was able to figure that
[06:11] out and decide you know what it's time
[06:13] for me to to I I eventually got to the
[06:17] point where I traded my music for
[06:18] Bitcoin and again it's that kager um and
[06:21] the music industry is very complex so we
[06:23] can get into how these deals kind of
[06:26] start for catalog acquisition right and
[06:29] that's kind of what I did when I sold my
[06:31] catalog so there's investors out there
[06:34] in the market that um basically offer
[06:37] you a multiple on how much your music
[06:40] royalties generate on a yearly
[06:43] basis so a prime example would be let's
[06:46] say you make I don't know
[06:48] $100,000 a year off of your music
[06:51] streams there'll be an investor that
[06:53] comes along and says hey you know I'll
[06:56] I'll give you a 7X what you make in one
[07:00] year right now but I'll own your music
[07:02] royalties in perpetuity now to some
[07:05] people it's a good deal to some people
[07:06] it's a bad deal and again we're talking
[07:09] about this is a very low tier artist
[07:12] here right now the more leverage you
[07:14] have the more money you make yearly uh
[07:18] if you're some sort of mainstream artist
[07:19] or what they call Legacy artist that
[07:22] multiple is in the 20s and the 30s right
[07:26] and and so now you could see if if you
[07:28] make maybe you know
[07:30] a couple million bucks a year and
[07:32] somebody offers you you know $50 million
[07:34] right now I mean it's a compelling thing
[07:38] to want you're definitely going to think
[07:39] about it right um and again when we talk
[07:43] about decay in music right you know
[07:47] sometimes how how are you so certain
[07:48] that your music is going to compound at
[07:50] a decent rate every year more often than
[07:52] not it probably won't unless you're
[07:53] Mariah Carey with you know one of those
[07:55] Christmas songs that comes in every
[07:57] holiday um so you know for a lot of
[08:01] artists that were like me in like these
[08:03] indd type of pockets where you're only
[08:05] going to get offered you know a six to
[08:06] 10x type of
[08:08] multiple I think it was It was kind of
[08:10] smart to trade my music and eventually
[08:12] wind up in in
[08:14] Bitcoin but while I did all this I
[08:16] definitely got smarter I studied a bunch
[08:18] and I opened up a record
[08:20] label and and yeah now you know looking
[08:25] at how the music industry operates and
[08:26] how they sign artists it's definitely uh
[08:29] a tough thing to see because a lot of
[08:31] these deals are like predatory in nature
[08:34] and that's kind of what what I wanted to
[08:35] discuss today how we could fix these
[08:37] types of deals to make both parties kind
[08:39] of meet in the middle you know and have
[08:41] a good handshake as opposed to never
[08:43] trusting each other really that's super
[08:46] interesting and you uh also sent me I
[08:48] think it was a Google Docs or something
[08:50] like that uh with with the thing I mean
[08:53] I can also actually pull it up because
[08:55] if it's it's really interesting how you
[08:57] summarize that those things
[09:00] no of course I I could pull it up too um
[09:04] but yeah I think I think first and like
[09:06] maybe the most important thing I can um
[09:09] I can bring up for your listeners is you
[09:11] know how how the music industry Works in
[09:13] general and that that one is it right
[09:15] yeah it's that one right
[09:17] there yeah um and so I think for the
[09:21] listeners maybe the most important thing
[09:23] they they they can understand is what is
[09:27] what's the most important asset in the
[09:29] music industry and it's um it's
[09:32] obviously the ability to collect the
[09:34] royalties every month that's huge right
[09:37] and so when a song is made there's two
[09:40] copyrights that are made there's what's
[09:42] known as the master recording and then
[09:45] there's what's known as the
[09:47] publishing um both super important but
[09:50] the one that probably generates you know
[09:52] 70 80% of the revenue from the song in
[09:55] and of itself is the master recording
[09:57] and that's the actual way file of the
[10:00] music right that actual wave file um and
[10:04] whoever owns this wave file is able to
[10:07] collect royalties on a monthly basis
[10:09] from Spotify from Apple music from
[10:12] YouTube music um and so it's very
[10:15] important to be the owner of that Master
[10:18] recording royalty so typically that's
[10:21] what record labels go after right they
[10:23] go after what's known as the master
[10:24] recording royalty so that's the most
[10:27] important thing understanding that um
[10:29] okay um Now record labels uh they have
[10:34] what's known as an anrs and these are
[10:36] people that work within the record
[10:37] labels and they just Scout the internet
[10:40] they're on they're on the internet
[10:42] they're on Twitter and they're
[10:43] constantly
[10:44] looking um for artists that are on an
[10:47] uptrend on an uptick you know they'll
[10:50] fly out meet them in person and then
[10:52] they'll tell the label hey we should
[10:53] probably sign this
[10:55] person um typically these artists you
[10:58] know are in their late teens early 20s
[11:02] don't know too much about
[11:04] music and and so you know if if you're
[11:08] if you're a teenager and a record label
[11:10] is offering you a
[11:11] deal more than likely you're going to
[11:13] just be chomping at the bits to take
[11:16] it um without knowing too much about how
[11:19] the deal will actually affect you in the
[11:21] long run um and again the record label
[11:25] is going after the master recording
[11:27] rights of this artist
[11:29] and in exchange what they're going to
[11:31] offer the artist is cash upfront right
[11:34] now so the record label just to make a
[11:37] scenario an easy scenario will say hey
[11:40] we think you're
[11:41] talented we want to offer you
[11:45] $100,000 uh but this is how we'll do it
[11:48] $50,000 can go in your pocket right
[11:51] now and the other $50,000 we can both
[11:54] decide how we can spend it um to Market
[11:57] you to spend on campaigns on Tik Tok we
[12:01] can we can use it for music videos if
[12:03] you want
[12:05] Etc and so this artist who you know
[12:08] maybe doesn't get too many streams is is
[12:10] thrilled he's over the moon I got to put
[12:12] 50 Grand in my pocket right now cool
[12:14] right or 100 Grand whatever it is it's
[12:16] it's all Dynamic right it depends on how
[12:18] much you make or or how the label sees
[12:20] you but in exchange for what the label
[12:24] is giving you what you're giving up is
[12:28] the Master recording rights of your
[12:31] music for either forever so in
[12:34] perpetuity you might be giving it up
[12:36] forever or for you know 20 to 30 years
[12:41] um which is very interesting you're
[12:43] going to lose that for a very long time
[12:44] now not only that once the label recoups
[12:48] what they've given
[12:49] you and they recoup their initial
[12:51] investment of
[12:53] 100K they'll uh then give you you know a
[12:57] 20 or 30% of whatever the music
[13:00] generates and they'll keep the other 70
[13:02] or
[13:03] 80% um so that's not fair obviously in
[13:06] the long run to the artists but they
[13:08] don't know any better but also to the
[13:11] labels credit you
[13:13] know they take on these very risky deals
[13:17] and and that's where we're going to move
[13:18] on to next which is risk there's so much
[13:20] risk associated with these with these
[13:24] deals and with these artists this is
[13:25] interesting because like you you take
[13:27] someone on that's in this te uh and
[13:31] maybe he just used to make for music for
[13:34] like two years was not bad in it but he
[13:36] doesn't really want to do it like maybe
[13:37] after like one year is like like goodbye
[13:40] like I don't I don't want to do it
[13:41] anymore like I now want to be a pro
[13:44] football player pursues it for five
[13:46] years and never comes back or like
[13:48] whatever so obviously it's risky but for
[13:52] me I I I mean I'm uh like have no clue
[13:55] about the music industry whatsoever um
[13:59] but for me is one question is like why
[14:01] do we need record labels in the first
[14:03] place now with tools like YouTube
[14:06] Spotify and all those things like most
[14:08] people just like for example in it's a
[14:12] little bit I compar it and maybe that
[14:13] comparison is bad but I compare it with
[14:15] like um we had we had uh News
[14:19] broadcasters we had all those uh media
[14:23] organizations and now we just have
[14:25] podcasts that like basically do do the
[14:27] themselves or like to on Twitter a bunch
[14:30] of people that just write stuff on their
[14:31] journalist and they actually make a
[14:33] living out of that um I mean guess the
[14:36] the the regular label has the advantage
[14:39] of providing with knowledge and and
[14:41] financial power uh up front and stuff
[14:43] like that uh but but what is the role
[14:47] now when we have social media and all
[14:49] those things that help people get
[14:51] discovered um for for reg good labels no
[14:55] that's a very good question and I think
[14:57] if you're an artist who's taking
[14:59] advantage of the Dei approach you're
[15:01] just giving yourself more leverage right
[15:04] to when to when these record labels
[15:06] approach you you could say ah I'm all
[15:08] right or maybe offer me the best thing
[15:10] ever right so um number one we obviously
[15:15] don't need record labels if we're
[15:17] already doing good on our own now they
[15:20] can come in and kind of implement a
[15:21] better strategy maybe offer you even
[15:24] more Capital maybe find a way to you
[15:28] know connect some dots for you get you
[15:30] in the rooms with certain people you
[15:32] know provide you a team of 20 30 people
[15:35] that are constantly talking about your
[15:37] project and figuring out ways to
[15:38] strategize it looking at every data
[15:40] point on it right but you're you're
[15:44] spoton um the de the DIY approach is the
[15:48] new Norm in the industry um and if you
[15:51] definitely build a lot of Leverage you
[15:53] can negotiate way better terms for
[15:55] yourself with a label um if you don't
[15:58] want to do everything on your own now
[16:00] the way we grew up we did everything on
[16:02] our own we came from the SoundCloud era
[16:05] when we were just we were just happy we
[16:07] would get a 100,000 streams or a million
[16:09] streams or two M we would just be over
[16:11] the moon broke but happy you
[16:14] know um interesting and once we figured
[16:17] out how to you know um put our music
[16:20] into Spotify Apple music Etc there's all
[16:23] these tools where you could do it
[16:24] yourself no problem right you can
[16:26] collect the revenue from your master
[16:29] recording yourself there's companies
[16:30] like Toon Core and drr kid where you
[16:33] could just upload your music and it'll
[16:35] be on all these Digital streaming
[16:38] platforms um and it's really helpful for
[16:41] the ND artist that's doing
[16:43] well but those labels are going to be
[16:45] knocking on your door when you're doing
[16:47] well and they're going to offer
[16:49] you um pretty lucrative deals that Mak
[16:53] sense for you now because now you as an
[16:54] artist have more
[16:56] leverage um and so that that's kind of
[16:59] the reason why labels still exist
[17:01] because they're they're still scouting
[17:03] talent and they're finding talent that
[17:05] has yet to be discovered where they're
[17:06] going to pour capital in capital in and
[17:08] take this immense risk right and they
[17:11] also exist because they're going after
[17:13] these trendy DIY type of artist but
[17:16] giving them maybe even better deals than
[17:19] the ones that are just starting out it's
[17:22] super interesting how this is a thing in
[17:25] music but not with any other content
[17:29] form in in the same way like if like
[17:33] like music is is just an art form uh and
[17:37] in the same way like creating short form
[17:40] video for example could be an considered
[17:43] be an art form depending on like I think
[17:45] in every way it could be depending on an
[17:48] art form um so I don't know of any any
[17:53] network that tries to get for example
[17:56] YouTubers or like uh other cont graders
[17:59] really early on and like sign them I
[18:01] think it could be a really good business
[18:03] model honestly uh if if someone does
[18:06] that and is is successful in in uh
[18:10] coaching uh the YouTubers and giving
[18:12] them the right tools to accelerate the
[18:14] growth and spotting the right talents
[18:16] and people that actually want to stick
[18:17] through with it um so uh it's an
[18:20] interesting F like I never looked at
[18:22] that way where you have those record
[18:25] labels in the music industry like why I
[18:28] did not
[18:29] why they not anywhere else um uh it's
[18:33] it's an I never thought about that no
[18:36] yeah and it's you know who knows it
[18:38] definitely probably is happening in
[18:40] YouTube you know uh I know you know uh
[18:43] there's this there's this one
[18:45] interviewer who sold a portion of like
[18:48] the IP rights early on and gave it up
[18:51] early on because of you know like you
[18:53] said uh just the framework of having the
[18:55] right team behind you um but again miss
[18:59] out on the future upside for you know
[19:01] the knowledge and everything else so
[19:02] it's just this it's this Balancing Act
[19:05] you got to kind of you know bet on
[19:07] yourself sometimes and and luckily
[19:09] that's what we did um when it came to
[19:10] our music we and we still own a bunch of
[19:13] it and we got in a pretty good deal
[19:15] where we partnered up with a with a
[19:17] major label to get some funding for our
[19:19] own label um and and now you know we're
[19:24] we're trying to take this concept um
[19:27] this year and run with it with with a
[19:29] new a that we sign and and yeah um I
[19:32] guess back to my point about the music
[19:35] industry and the risk so when we
[19:37] identify the risk as you mentioned yeah
[19:40] what if this teenager after getting this
[19:42] money uh decides to you know what I
[19:45] don't I don't feel like making music
[19:46] anymore I actually feel like painting
[19:48] now that's amazing but now the label is
[19:51] out you know $100,000 in that scenario
[19:55] right um and all the the collateral that
[19:58] they have to show for the only
[19:59] collateral that's within these deals is
[20:02] the
[20:03] music um so let's say another scenario
[20:07] let's say that this that this teenager
[20:09] you know um other artist that's in his
[20:11] early 20s even decides to deliver the
[20:14] album to the music label and it doesn't
[20:17] perform well at all and they spent the
[20:21] the $100,000 in this scenario already on
[20:24] music videos and um Tik Tock ads and um
[20:29] all these other types of marketing uh
[20:32] ads well now the labels out all that
[20:36] income and let's say the music's only
[20:38] making I don't know $500 a month or
[20:42] something like that I mean it's going to
[20:44] take the label 20 something I don't know
[20:46] I don't know the math here but a very
[20:49] long time to recoup on their investment
[20:51] and they're going to be miserable and
[20:53] you know that's why these deals exist
[20:56] right because they're taking flyers and
[20:57] they're losing 90% of the time on their
[21:00] deals 90% of the time they know that
[21:03] they're going to lose so it's a volume
[21:05] game they're trying to sign as much
[21:06] talent as possible um because they know
[21:09] when they find one with a lot of upside
[21:12] they're not going to be making $500 a
[21:14] month they're going to be
[21:15] making hundreds of thousands if not
[21:17] millions of dollars a month and the
[21:19] label is going to be raking in all that
[21:21] profit and it's going to make up for all
[21:23] the bad
[21:24] deals it's it's a you heard that yeah no
[21:28] no wor uh it's a little bit like Venture
[21:31] Capital uh like spotting the the the
[21:34] companies early on and like giving them
[21:37] a framework to think about it's
[21:38] interesting because I got approached um
[21:42] uh I think from yeah let's say free
[21:45] different uh people uh to actually
[21:47] invest in my my podcast and I always
[21:51] said no um because simply just um want
[21:55] to at that point of my podcast journey I
[21:59] basically would sell myself like it's
[22:01] it's the robin podcast it's like it's
[22:03] just me so like at this point it feels
[22:05] like I would sell myself and I wouldn't
[22:07] I don't want to put a price tag on
[22:09] myself if I have like a small business
[22:12] I'm like okay makes more sense to bring
[22:14] like an investor in part of it and stuff
[22:16] like that uh but it it always was like a
[22:19] weird concept for me
[22:21] um really make it myself and only bring
[22:25] a partner in if I'm thinking like okay
[22:27] he can help me in a major way in in a
[22:30] thing uh that I cannot provide or I
[22:33] cannot do right now otherwise I'm like
[22:36] I'm just using the money that comes in
[22:39] to reinvest and get an editor and and
[22:42] learn myself like especially if you're
[22:43] young like you can you have time you can
[22:45] learn uh and and those learnings that
[22:47] you do with building the first company
[22:49] or building a record label or building
[22:52] uh yourself as a artist I think there is
[22:54] really valuable time uh on you and and
[22:58] then maybe actually makes sense for the
[23:00] second company to bring investors in and
[23:03] to make it from the beginning a little
[23:04] bit bigger but maybe you already have
[23:06] Capital but that's a whole different
[23:08] sorry that's a whole different uh topic
[23:12] and tangum here there's so much
[23:13] interesting things here because like
[23:15] music industry is completely new topic
[23:16] and usually I only talk about Bitcoin so
[23:19] I'm getting excited if there there's new
[23:20] topics to talk about no I'm glad I'm
[23:23] glad we could do it but it's exactly
[23:24] what you said too you want to find
[23:26] someone that can add value right you
[23:28] want to find somebody that can come in
[23:29] and add value to whatever it is that
[23:31] you're creating um in this instance in
[23:33] the music industry um when we're talking
[23:35] about those DIY artists why do labels
[23:38] still exist why will they go after them
[23:40] um again if they're doing well the
[23:42] artist may consider it if they can add
[23:44] value um you know if they can add value
[23:46] to their business but now they're not
[23:47] parting with too much of their business
[23:49] right they're parting with a very tiny
[23:51] portion um and and we can talk about
[23:54] those types of deals because every
[23:56] single deal is dynamic within this music
[23:58] industry right it's all based on you
[24:00] know how much you generate how much
[24:02] leverage do you have how many monthly
[24:04] listeners you have and everything the
[24:06] structure of the deal will change
[24:08] drastically depending on The Leverage
[24:11] you have and the people in your team to
[24:13] make a reasonable deal uh for you um but
[24:17] again it all boils down to adding value
[24:19] and just as you mentioned on how you can
[24:22] you know do things yourself edit
[24:24] yourself um you know uh figure out how
[24:27] to do certain programs um there's a lot
[24:30] of value for artists in the music
[24:32] industry that know how to record
[24:34] themselves that know how to produce
[24:36] their own music um not every artist with
[24:39] a good voice knows how to record
[24:41] themselves knows how to even turn on a
[24:44] MacBook and figure out the application
[24:46] that they need to open they they need
[24:48] somebody by their side 247 to record
[24:50] them they need somebody to make them
[24:51] sound good and they need somebody to
[24:53] make the beat um and so more often than
[24:57] not the artist with a lot more leverage
[24:59] too are The Talented ones who can do
[25:01] everything themselves as well because it
[25:03] doesn't cost them too much to produce a
[25:05] record um if if you look at some of
[25:08] these labels when they sign artists that
[25:11] can't do anything themselves they
[25:13] usually have to also allocate a portion
[25:14] of the capital into what's known as the
[25:16] recording budget so they can go to a
[25:19] studio find someone to record them find
[25:21] somebody to make them sound good find
[25:24] somebody to make the music and now it's
[25:27] getting even more expensive I right and
[25:29] so the label's going to want a bigger
[25:31] piece because you have less leverage um
[25:34] so all all this stuff kind of boils on
[25:37] to more risk right there's more risk if
[25:40] you don't know how to make your own
[25:42] music and it's going to cost us money to
[25:44] produce it there's more risk if we're
[25:47] only banking on the future performance
[25:50] of your music because if it doesn't
[25:52] perform well well that's all we hold as
[25:54] collateral as a
[25:56] label um there's more risk as the label
[25:58] because what if we were signing you and
[26:00] you were a trendy artist and that trend
[26:02] has now sailed away and there's
[26:04] something new and exciting right um so
[26:08] those are all the risks that the label
[26:10] faces um but now let's look at it from
[26:12] an artist's perspective right because I
[26:14] also think like an artist as well
[26:15] because I am one um and so for an artist
[26:20] okay well let's say I sign this steal I
[26:23] do great I deliver my music it does
[26:27] fantastic and start getting a little bit
[26:29] older and smarter and I start realizing
[26:32] hey I recouped my money how much am I
[26:34] making again oh
[26:37] 30% 40% of what 20% um and so there's
[26:42] some bitterness involved there right now
[26:44] you're like wait a second this deal it
[26:46] wasn't really too fair for me um and
[26:48] usually when labels sign a younger
[26:50] Talent they have what's known as option
[26:53] periods so they're able to say hey
[26:55] you're still with us so you have to give
[26:56] us a next album now and we're going to
[26:58] exercise our next option period um so
[27:02] now deliver the next album but you're
[27:04] going to have this unhappy artist now
[27:06] that's delivering this next album who's
[27:08] just delivering music in the most
[27:10] productive years of his artistic career
[27:13] to get out of the deal that they signed
[27:14] when they were younger um and so you
[27:17] could see how it's not fair for the
[27:18] artist um and you can see how the artist
[27:21] also needs to think about well you guys
[27:24] have a marketing fund for me how how do
[27:26] I know that you guys won't you know
[27:28] deploy this capital in a poor way how do
[27:30] I know that you're making the best use
[27:32] of this Capital um because typically the
[27:35] labels say hey we're going to spend
[27:36] money on you know um PR and we're going
[27:39] to get you on all these interview places
[27:42] you're going to go and do radio spots
[27:45] we're going to get you on this blog and
[27:47] the third and they'll spend tens of
[27:49] thousands doll of dollars monthly on a
[27:52] on a publicist and what if they only get
[27:55] them a few blog writeups well then
[27:57] that's just wasted capital right and
[27:58] it's not fair for the artist either um
[28:01] so you could see how both sides really
[28:03] it's they're both kind of unhappy in the
[28:05] end right and it's really bad it's it's
[28:07] just really bad business being done I
[28:10] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[28:13] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[28:16] that I ever saw created by anyone look

[30:16] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:19] level up your sovereignty it's
[30:21] interesting one thing that I was also
[30:23] thinking about is um sometimes if you're
[30:27] an artist if you're a con Creator if
[30:29] you're an entrepreneur um you have
[30:32] really a tough time sometimes like you
[30:35] just like oh like you have some some
[30:37] kind of hurdle challenge whatever you
[30:39] have to go through H and uh those are
[30:42] the long nights the the the the the hard
[30:45] days the hard I don't know like weeks
[30:47] whatever uh that you have to kind of
[30:49] sitp through uh and I feel like if you
[30:55] own more of it if you own more of the
[30:59] upside you are more incentivized and
[31:01] motivated to sift through those things
[31:04] uh if you because you you are working
[31:07] for yourself and for your for your
[31:10] future uh it's the same way like an
[31:12] employee who has on a company who has
[31:16] like zero stake in the company and zero
[31:19] interest uh uh then growing that company
[31:22] other than doing his job uh and getting
[31:26] a salary he will not not uh be motivated
[31:30] to work at like 11:30 p.m. to make that
[31:33] presentation to deliver it next day in
[31:36] the morning 5: a.m to the to the to the
[31:39] client but an entrepreneur does and he
[31:42] will uh say like oh I will not sleep
[31:45] today because I will make that
[31:46] presentation or like whatever it is um
[31:49] so I think like
[31:51] ownership uh and a fair deal is not only
[31:54] as you said only not only good for uh
[31:57] the artist but I think also for the
[31:59] record label of like is gives him the
[32:01] motivation to work really hard because
[32:03] he knows if he works hard he gets a lot
[32:05] of The Upside so that I just wanted to
[32:07] add that here because I think like it's
[32:09] really important also to to see the
[32:11] motivation side of the artist for the
[32:13] record label no exactly exactly the the
[32:17] artist the artist needs a part of that
[32:20] upside you don't you don't want an
[32:22] artist that is going to feel um that's
[32:25] going to look back on their deal on
[32:27] their most prod Ive years of their
[32:29] creativity and realized that they gave
[32:30] most of it up without even knowing
[32:33] sometimes right without even knowing um
[32:37] because yeah there's there's lawyers and
[32:38] there's there's people that look after
[32:40] these deals but again um ultimately the
[32:43] lawyer is going to say this is the best
[32:44] deal for you at the time because it it
[32:46] sometimes it really is right it's not
[32:48] the lawyer's fault that you didn't have
[32:49] any leverage um but that's why I think
[32:52] Bitcoin could be so powerful if used
[32:55] correctly as collateral because it can
[32:57] kind of bridge the a gap between the
[33:00] these insane deals where no one's really
[33:01] happy and we can kind of meet in the
[33:03] middle somewhere where it makes sense
[33:05] for everyone and there's more upside um
[33:07] and not only that I think I think art
[33:09] will be better over time when we
[33:11] introduce Bitcoin into these deals um
[33:15] and so again one of the main components
[33:17] as to why these deals are structured
[33:19] like this is because the collateral is
[33:21] just very bad and there's a lot of risk
[33:23] and usually the music that the artist
[33:27] delivers sometimes won't get in a
[33:29] recouped position quick enough and so
[33:32] another thing that happens too is that
[33:34] the artist never gets the option to make
[33:36] the next album and they're what's known
[33:38] as a shelv artist or they're just stuck
[33:40] in
[33:41] limbo after they deliver a piece of art
[33:44] that might have been good by the way
[33:45] right it's not their fault maybe it
[33:47] didn't perform as well it might have
[33:48] been good but now they're stuck they
[33:52] don't know if they have to deliver
[33:53] another album they can't go anywhere
[33:55] else the label has the rights to you
[33:57] know them
[33:58] exclusively and we're just in this
[34:01] scenario where an artist really can't
[34:03] you know create anything until the label
[34:05] tells them you know hey you know what
[34:07] we're moving on from you or hey you know
[34:08] what we're going to pick up your option
[34:10] either way very scary stuff more more
[34:13] stress on the artist too um and so apart
[34:17] from that the Decay rate of Music how we
[34:19] talked about earlier right let's say
[34:21] you're not one of these um what's known
[34:24] as Legacy artist where you know the
[34:26] catalog just is on on a crazy uptick
[34:28] over time and it's more on this decaying
[34:32] type of type of slope well you know
[34:36] you're obviously going to recoup slower
[34:38] over time and again there there's once
[34:42] you recoup the money for the label and
[34:44] once you start seeing some of the income
[34:47] it's going to be significantly less
[34:49] right after a while um so there's all
[34:53] these variables in play um that that
[34:55] make these deals what they are right now
[34:57] but now if you introduce Bitcoin into
[35:00] the equation it can solve a lot of the
[35:02] problems and it can it can make these
[35:04] deals going go from being Perpetual in
[35:07] nature where you know the label is going
[35:08] to own the music
[35:10] forever um to you know maybe licensing
[35:14] terms of seven to 10 years and those
[35:17] would be the holding periods for the
[35:18] Bitcoin because as we know maybe Bitcoin
[35:21] over a course of one year can be very
[35:24] volatile two years very volatile but
[35:26] over a course of 10
[35:28] I think it's pretty safe to assume that
[35:31] it's it's it's going to be a good bet
[35:33] that it's going to go up over time and
[35:36] that gets the artist's account in a
[35:38] recouped position quicker it doesn't
[35:40] allow them to give up too much of the
[35:43] equity initially because if they're okay
[35:46] in using Bitcoin as collateral for their
[35:48] deal well now they're going to instead
[35:51] of it being 70% in favor of the label
[35:53] and 30% for the artist it'll be flipped
[35:56] in Reverse right
[35:58] it'll be 70 or 80% in favor of the
[36:01] artist or 30 and 20% for the label
[36:04] because the artist is willing to use
[36:06] Bitcoin as collateral within the deal um
[36:09] so the way this scenario would work is
[36:12] is kind of like the other one we talked
[36:13] about and let's use the same $100,000
[36:17] example um so let's say you know it's
[36:21] there's an artist again um kind of
[36:25] starting out very talented has some
[36:27] stream they get scouted by an
[36:29] anr um and the label is willing to spend
[36:33] $100,000 on them well what if what if
[36:38] $50,000 goes in a fund for Bitcoin
[36:42] collateral and the other
[36:44] $50,000 is there to spend on the
[36:46] artist's music career what if we spend
[36:49] 50,000 on music videos recording
[36:51] whatever it is we want to spend on you
[36:53] on the pr we talked about and then the
[36:56] other 50 is locked as
[37:00] collateral um for as long as a licensing
[37:03] term exists on the deal so if the
[37:05] licensing term is 10 years then the
[37:07] Bitcoin is collateral for 10 years um
[37:11] and what we're going to see is so much
[37:13] risk being removed the label instantly
[37:16] has collateral from day one and the
[37:18] artist gets to keep more of their rights
[37:20] and keep their upside right and not only
[37:23] that there's a lot of variables in place
[37:25] again all these deals are Dynamic so if
[37:27] if you recoup you know in a matter of uh
[37:30] a few years time you're going to share a
[37:33] lot of upside on that Bitcoin
[37:34] appreciation with the label right it's
[37:37] all Dynamic it all changes
[37:38] interchangeable if you never recoup well
[37:41] at least the label has the Bitcoin as
[37:43] collateral to keep offering these types
[37:45] of deals to newer artists right um and
[37:49] so this can fundamentally change the way
[37:52] the music industry works and it can it
[37:55] can put power back in the artist hands
[37:59] and and being able to own something and
[38:01] also shareing the upside of of their
[38:03] catalog and in Bitcoin um and last but
[38:06] not least like we talked about a Decay
[38:08] rate with music but with Bitcoin why
[38:11] wouldn't you want something that
[38:13] compounds here over year at 30 40% right
[38:17] over time your account will be recouped
[38:19] in no time probably by a year three or
[38:21] four in some of the math that we do um
[38:25] so that's essentially what I want to
[38:27] bring to the Forefront and that's what I
[38:29] what I want to add um to when it comes
[38:31] to the music industry especially with
[38:33] our record label and that's something
[38:34] we're going to be implementing with with
[38:36] even the deals that we do for our own
[38:38] guys um including myself uh so it's
[38:41] going to be an amazing journey that I'm
[38:43] looking forward forward to do and it's
[38:46] going to open the door for these anrs to
[38:49] not Chase Trends anymore remember when
[38:52] we talked about anrs that are part of
[38:54] these scouting departments you know at
[38:57] the end of the day they're trying to
[38:58] keep their job they're not trying to
[39:00] lose their job and so they they have to
[39:02] bring somebody in that makes some
[39:03] Revenue um and they have to get these
[39:06] deals in place and they can't really go
[39:08] after those passion projects they can't
[39:10] really go after the really talented um
[39:13] musician who only gets a few thousand
[39:15] streams on a song because it won't
[39:17] generate enough Revenue um and so I
[39:20] think it'll bring power more to to anrs
[39:23] and artists that are really actually
[39:25] talented if we introduce Bitcoin as
[39:27] collateral um just so so many things we
[39:30] could talk about so many branches to to
[39:32] come off of here and just so many
[39:34] thoughts that I have especially with
[39:35] this stuff yeah there there's actually a
[39:38] lot especially the the impact Bitcoin
[39:42] can have on the
[39:44] individual uh because it has Financial
[39:47] Security all of the sudden it that that
[39:49] is something that I'm very passionate
[39:53] about of like okay what will Bitcoin do
[39:57] to you as a person once you all once you
[40:01] are able to save a little bit of your
[40:03] extra cash flow in Bitcoin and all of
[40:07] the sudden you see hope you see like
[40:11] okay there there's some Financial
[40:13] stability I all of a sudden have or like
[40:15] I have that much money now in Bitcoin I
[40:19] could live even if Bitcoin drops like
[40:21] 80% and it stays there for four years I
[40:24] could live so many years from that stack
[40:27] like you you get you you all of the
[40:28] sudden feel a little bit relieved all of
[40:31] like a stone off your shoulders and uh
[40:34] it it's actually don't want to talk too
[40:37] much about me but it's actually the the
[40:39] the way this podcast got started when I
[40:41] decided to go all in and go all in with
[40:44] the podcast I didn't had income I didn't
[40:47] had like any like big deals or knew
[40:49] anyone I had 500 subscribers on YouTube
[40:52] you know that this doesn't pay
[40:55] anything so I was like just like going
[40:57] in there uh and I was willing to live
[41:01] off my Bitcoin savings for like one to
[41:02] two years and I was like okay let's do
[41:04] it um uh and luckily I never had to do
[41:10] that luckily uh I made every month uh
[41:14] positive cash flow and I could Venture
[41:17] in that and really accelerated uh the
[41:20] the growth of the podcast with that so
[41:23] coming back to artists I'm really
[41:25] excited of like what
[41:28] what what things will we do once the
[41:31] individual really gets set free and not
[41:34] be held back by a depth burden that that
[41:37] that is that is just I think it will be
[41:40] magical yeah and I mean it's awesome
[41:43] that you share your story too because
[41:44] you're you're creative you're creative
[41:46] you're constantly making content and you
[41:48] took a you took a huge bet on yourself
[41:51] you know there wasn't there wasn't
[41:52] anybody injecting Capital right away
[41:54] saying okay let's let's produce this
[41:57] let's get the the lighting let's make
[41:58] sure the sounds no none of that you took
[42:00] a bet on yourself and and yeah it's it's
[42:03] great when you take a bet on yourself
[42:05] and it pays off it's it's it's an
[42:07] amazing feeling um and you know in the
[42:09] music industry there's so many success
[42:11] stories like that as well and and I'm so
[42:13] happy to be a part of some um but again
[42:16] when there's when there's a lot of debt
[42:17] like you mentioned on an artist shoulder
[42:20] and they're looking back and they're
[42:21] saying man I got to recoup all this cash
[42:24] or else the label's not going to be
[42:26] happy they're not going to want another
[42:27] project from me I'm going to be sheld as
[42:30] an artist it's it's a it's a lot of
[42:32] pressure it's a lot of pressure so if
[42:34] you introduce Bitcoin something that can
[42:37] go up over time and as we like to see it
[42:41] kind of risk off right it's it to me
[42:43] it's the most least riskiest thing I own
[42:47] um so to have that as part of your deal
[42:50] I think you can breathe a side of relief
[42:52] as an artist and say okay I'm fine and
[42:55] then again back to this point if if the
[42:59] record label says Hey his first album
[43:02] you know the streaming Revenue didn't do
[43:04] too well but the Bitcoin that we still
[43:07] have on collateral is performing
[43:08] fantastically his account is in a recoup
[43:11] position because of that why not give
[43:13] him the next album right so it makes the
[43:16] label even more inclined to take another
[43:19] bet on this artist that's willing to
[43:22] have pristine collateral within their
[43:24] deal um and again I think one of the
[43:27] main reasons as to why I'm so adamant
[43:29] about speaking about this especially
[43:31] with you and other individuals in the
[43:33] music industry is because I want more
[43:35] artists to know that there's this type
[43:38] of option on the table it's all about
[43:41] negotiating and it's all about um you
[43:44] know thinking outside the box in these
[43:47] types of situations and when we add
[43:49] better collateral to these deals we're
[43:51] going to get better art and we're going
[43:53] to get artists that um that we've never
[43:57] heard before heard of before with these
[44:00] types of deals um have you when I read
[44:03] the Bitcoin
[44:04] standard um one of the points that the
[44:07] author makes in that book is how when we
[44:09] were on the gold standard some of the
[44:11] best art was commissioned some of the
[44:14] some of the best art in the world was
[44:16] commissioned um and and again I see the
[44:18] same thing happening um with Bitcoin
[44:21] with
[44:22] Bitcoin do you also uh hold it on the
[44:26] balance sheet and uh for for for the
[44:29] label itself unfortunately unfortunately
[44:32] I I have other uh people a part of the
[44:35] company who still aren't uh uh fully
[44:39] ported um so we don't hold Bitcoin on
[44:41] the balance sheet but I myself um have
[44:44] done everything I can to own Bitcoin um
[44:48] on on my personal balance
[44:50] sheet yeah it's it's it's it gets hard
[44:54] when you have uh company structures and
[44:56] then like you have have to convince more
[44:58] people uh that's why I think also the
[45:00] adoption of companies will just take
[45:03] longer like we we will we won't be at
[45:06] all of the companies like in next five
[45:08] years it will take time the the
[45:10] companies have ports the companies have
[45:11] owners they they they have to come to a
[45:14] conclusion they have to uh be convinced
[45:16] they have to learn about those things
[45:17] and we all know like individually we
[45:20] have a lot of different learning curves
[45:22] on bitcoin and then the compan is just
[45:25] many different
[45:27] asynchronous uh learning cycles that you
[45:30] have to go through uh and you go one by
[45:32] one and it's a process it's it's
[45:35] fascinating how fast Michael saor did it
[45:38] with with micro strategy and how
[45:40] efficient he did it uh and it's it's
[45:42] great that there's like meta planet and
[45:45] and sem scientific and other ones that
[45:47] followed through but obviously it takes
[45:50] time like till like an apple or Facebook
[45:53] comes along and and we're getting closer
[45:55] we're getting closer with now Bank being
[45:57] able to custody Bitcoin I think I think
[46:00] it's only a matter of time when when it
[46:02] it really starts to take off and so I'm
[46:04] looking forward to that because you know
[46:06] once Banks can start customing
[46:09] Bitcoin oh man I mean it's to me it's
[46:11] bigger than the Strategic Reserve
[46:14] because there's going to be more and
[46:15] more people that are going to say you
[46:18] know what okay we can add a tower
[46:19] balance sheet now and we can we can
[46:21] borrow against it um which I know a lot
[46:24] of Bitcoin Maxis aren't going to aren't
[46:26] too thrilled sometimes when it comes to
[46:28] borrowing against your stack um but when
[46:30] banks are custody it um and you do it in
[46:33] a reasonable way it's just another way
[46:36] to add leverage to your company and
[46:38] that's unfortunately why a lot of
[46:40] companies don't own Bitcoin because they
[46:42] can't borrow against it um right and so
[46:45] when when Banks can start customing it
[46:46] when there's more instruments that are
[46:48] being created as the ones that Michael
[46:50] sailor does with micro strategy and so
[46:53] forth um companies are going to want to
[46:57] to add it on their balance sheet so I'm
[46:59] looking forward to those days I think
[47:01] it's it's smooth skies ahead right now
[47:05] absolutely 100% and it makes sense
[47:08] because like it it almost and in the
[47:10] same way it it is good for the uh
[47:13] artists to put like Bitcoin in their
[47:16] deals uh it's the same way of companies
[47:20] putting uh Bitcoin on their balance
[47:21] sheet because it makes the whole
[47:24] Venture um long good term because all of
[47:28] the sudden if there's Bitcoin involved
[47:31] in the company in the dealing whatever
[47:34] even if there's like a slower period of
[47:36] the company of the artist of like
[47:38] whatever you you use it for you can
[47:40] compensate it with maybe some some
[47:43] Bitcoin profits and you're like okay
[47:44] like now we can live off the Bitcoin for
[47:46] a little bit uh and you can dive through
[47:49] those low phases uh to then really fully
[47:53] grasp the the the big ones and if you're
[47:55] just like on zero and once it gets
[47:58] working a little uh once it stop working
[48:00] a little bit you on your own and you're
[48:02] like oh it doesn't work anymore because
[48:04] we don't have Financial Security and
[48:05] don't have Financial safety it it does
[48:08] something with our brains it's it like
[48:11] having a Financial Security is um
[48:15] extremely important uh for the
[48:18] creativity of human beings to unfold and
[48:21] and really develop so I'm I'm also
[48:23] really curious on on your take on this
[48:26] what do you think is the the impact uh
[48:29] on bit of Bitcoin on our world once it
[48:32] gets fully uh
[48:34] adopted man that's that's a good one um
[48:38] I think I mean of course Art's going to
[48:41] get better and I think we're going to be
[48:44] just more efficient we're just going to
[48:45] be more efficient we're going to be
[48:48] we're going to be looking for ways to
[48:50] get the most out of our Capital because
[48:52] it's going to be hard to kind of part
[48:54] with our Capital if it isn't done
[48:56] efficient so I think we're going to
[48:58] we're going
[48:59] to x out all the
[49:02] waste and it's just going to be a
[49:04] society built around efficiency on
[49:07] bitcoin and um again the deflationary
[49:12] aspect of it is amazing and I think
[49:14] that's what's going to allow us to to
[49:16] Really ramp up on on creativity and and
[49:18] focus
[49:19] on on I don't know just amazing
[49:23] technological breakthroughs and advances
[49:25] because again we're spending money WI
[49:26] wisely again because when money's cheap
[49:29] when when money's cheap you're just
[49:30] trying to get rid of it right it's like
[49:32] a hot potato but but when you're holding
[49:34] on to bitcoin and we're a society that's
[49:37] that's that's structured around it and
[49:38] it's the nucleus of everything you're
[49:41] not going to want to just part with it
[49:44] for uh you know I don't know uh a random
[49:48] I don't know a random movie that makes
[49:49] no sense right you're really going to
[49:50] want to put value into the world and and
[49:53] that's where I see us
[49:54] going yeah you you put the value back uh
[49:59] that that that you need and you like try
[50:02] you it it almost almost is like you want
[50:05] to spend only on more valuable things on
[50:08] on things that that are preserved over a
[50:11] long period of time and and you're like
[50:14] like I don't want to spend it on cheap
[50:16] things I want to spend valuable money on
[50:19] valuable things and cheap things on and
[50:21] cheap money on cheap things almost dude
[50:24] that's how it works right that's how it
[50:26] works man I I look at everything now and
[50:29] I'm like yeah no can't do it can't buy
[50:31] this right now i' I'd much rather I'd
[50:34] much rather own Bitcoin you know um sold
[50:37] a lot of sold a lot of you know Goods
[50:40] that I thought I needed in my life that
[50:43] have served no no purpose at all served
[50:45] no purpose at all you know so we're
[50:48] we're getting there and and I can't wait
[50:49] for us to to to fully embrace it once
[50:52] Bitcoin uh fully launches you know and
[50:55] it it take storm because there's still
[50:58] so many people that don't understand it
[51:00] you know I'm an avid golfer play golf a
[51:02] lot do some rounds with some people and
[51:05] I mean we're talking about the
[51:07] wealthiest people still can't grasp it
[51:10] and I feel it's because they don't
[51:13] they're they're not trying to find um
[51:17] they're not trying to find a safe haven
[51:18] for their capital I think they're fine
[51:20] with the way the Fiat system works
[51:22] they're fine with the way everything and
[51:23] they're not really looking for that
[51:24] outside education right the financial
[51:27] planner maybe is telling them hey we're
[51:29] gonna put you know one or two%
[51:31] allocation or maybe they're invested in
[51:33] the QQQ and they don't know they have
[51:35] exposure to micro strategy right but
[51:38] it's it's crazy to me how yeah these the
[51:40] very very wealthy few individuals that
[51:43] that I've come across in my lifetime
[51:46] still
[51:46] aren't um studied on it um and me I have
[51:50] a stepson of family and I'm doing
[51:52] everything I can as a bitcoiner to teach
[51:54] them how how money works right and so
[51:57] everyone around me kind of understands
[51:59] Bitcoin my my son would rather have a
[52:01] Bitcoin than like a Lamborghini you know
[52:04] I'm like what what would you want more a
[52:06] Bitcoin or a Lambo he's like oh a
[52:08] Bitcoin because it's gonna go up over
[52:09] time and I can get get 10 you know so
[52:13] it's amazing to see yeah kids almost get
[52:15] the the value quicker
[52:17] than like you're like you get it how did
[52:21] you actually yourself find Bitcoin and
[52:23] get over that F of like okay like oh
[52:25] it's bad f environment oh it's so
[52:27] speculative oh like governments will ban
[52:29] it and all those things that then come
[52:31] up with with a lot of people how did you
[52:33] get over that man um I think first and
[52:38] foremost just studying it reading about
[52:40] it um and then listening about it and
[52:43] then I mean your podcast was huge and
[52:46] then Michael sailor was really big I
[52:49] mean he's he's the Bitcoin Ambassador he
[52:51] he really paints a picture there and and
[52:55] the more and more I listened to to
[52:56] Michael sailor the more and more I
[52:58] realized yeah I mean this is this is
[53:01] pristine money and so him um you know
[53:05] books obviously the Bitcoin standard um
[53:09] just just all that um YouTube just
[53:11] constantly going on YouTube finding
[53:13] like-minded people who who were talking
[53:15] good stuff um it just made more and more
[53:17] sense as you know risk-free risk-free to
[53:21] me yourself yeah like I I it's super
[53:24] interesting when I think about uh that
[53:27] that that story of getting into Bitcoin
[53:30] like I was uh I thought Bitcoin is a
[53:32] scam for three years straight uh and and
[53:35] needed questions of friends of like okay
[53:37] like what are you thinking about bit I I
[53:40] told that story many times on the
[53:42] podcast I will just quickly rehearse it
[53:44] it's like I uh I was in the stocks
[53:47] before I was successful in stocks before
[53:49] and people came up to me like what do
[53:51] you think about Bitcoin not even Bitcoin
[53:53] it's just like people that were curious
[53:54] because they know like stocks and they
[53:56] put like stocks and Bitcoin in one
[53:58] pocket and I kind of discovered even
[54:01] though I had the opinion that Bitcoin is
[54:02] a scam that I didn't really had uh
[54:06] Arguments for that I really was like
[54:09] like it's it's not I don't really have
[54:11] an argument why Bitcoin is a scam and
[54:14] that's why I was on the search of uh of
[54:17] arguments why Bitcoin is a scam and in
[54:19] that search I actually came across
[54:21] Bitcoin and I actually was like oh like
[54:23] maybe Bitcoin isn't the scam maybe
[54:25] Bitcoin is something so I think it
[54:27] takes I think it takes uh openness like
[54:31] you have to be curious and open uh do
[54:33] the idea of it otherwise you won't find
[54:37] it there's so much information noise out
[54:39] there that if you Google what is bitcoin
[54:43] and you want to find uh the the truth
[54:47] and you are honest about it you will
[54:49] find it and if you're not honest about
[54:51] it and you don't want to find the truth
[54:54] you will find oh like an article that
[54:56] it's bad for the environment and one
[54:57] article that it's speculative if one
[54:59] article will never be money and then
[55:01] you're like okay I write three articles
[55:03] spend 10 minutes on my education my
[55:06] conclusion is Bitcoin is a fought and it
[55:08] will not uh be great yeah that's I don't
[55:11] know if that's education it's confirming
[55:14] your own bias uh but that's not true
[55:17] education that's not like that's not
[55:19] honest if you're you're not honest with
[55:22] yourself and I've never really met a
[55:24] good Bitcoin critic if if to if you ask
[55:27] them long enough why they think Bitcoin
[55:30] is not good they are running out of
[55:33] arguments like if you just like keep
[55:34] running or like okay like why do you
[55:36] think it uses too much energy okay like
[55:39] okay why is it used in that way and then
[55:42] you just get they say something and you
[55:44] like ask about it and ask about it and
[55:46] ask about it and usually I discover on
[55:48] like the fourth wave of asking or fifth
[55:51] wave of asking they're like oh okay I
[55:54] don't know that like they they're
[55:57] running out of arguments because they
[55:59] didn't deeply study it at least that's
[56:02] that's my
[56:04] uh that's my subjective um uh
[56:08] experiences with with some Bitcoin
[56:10] critics in in real in the real world no
[56:13] I love to hear it man it's good it's
[56:15] good to see uh you know that you're
[56:17] constantly talking to people and and and
[56:19] asking them these questions and it's
[56:22] funny with me um when I I keep buying
[56:25] Bitcoin and my dad just goes oh man but
[56:28] you know he likes Bitcoin my father does
[56:31] but now he goes okay so when do you plan
[56:34] on selling it I'm
[56:36] like what's your exit strategy looking
[56:39] like never never I'll never sell it uh
[56:44] I'll always own it um and so it's just
[56:46] funny it's it still takes a while for
[56:49] you know the the older generation to
[56:52] catch on to I mean it's it's amazing
[56:53] that we have somebody like Michael
[56:55] sailor who like it's like my father's
[56:57] age right who understands this stuff who
[56:59] who took such a big bet on bitcoin with
[57:02] this company but is it really a bet if
[57:04] if you deem it the least riskiest thing
[57:07] right um and so and so with me yeah it's
[57:11] fun um educating my friends and family
[57:13] on it and and anytime I get the question
[57:15] you know when will you part with it
[57:17] never you know um I heard your last
[57:20] podcast I'm like hm I'm going to have to
[57:22] do some estate plan figure out how to
[57:24] give the keys to my next Akin
[57:26] right um maybe have them go through a a
[57:31] hourlong course and and pass a huge test
[57:34] before they even get access to the keys
[57:36] so they truly understand it right
[57:38] something like that yeah yeah like
[57:41] inheritance planning is is is super
[57:43] important uh that's that's it's
[57:45] something it's sometimes overlooked with
[57:47] with bitcoiners they they're really
[57:48] excited about Bitcoin but they don't
[57:50] think about like how do I want to give
[57:53] it to to my my airs and how do wanted to
[57:56] give it to my my people um but yeah it's
[57:59] it's it's definitely interesting um I
[58:01] have one question that I asked each and
[58:03] every one of my guests and the question
[58:04] is like what can we learn from you
[58:05] besides Bitcoin I would add with you
[58:08] besides music
[58:10] also um what we can learn from me is um
[58:14] yeah when I when I when I sold a portion
[58:19] of my music catalog um and I and I had
[58:23] this influx of cash that I had no idea
[58:25] what to do with with and I eventually
[58:27] got smart I I worked my whole life to
[58:29] get to the point where I could have um
[58:32] these x amount of dollars in my head
[58:34] that I thought would make me truly happy
[58:36] or this x amount that I thought would
[58:37] make me you know forget about everything
[58:40] and all the worries and I I think what I
[58:42] really learned at at that moment when I
[58:45] had all the free time in the world and I
[58:47] finally had you know quote unquote you
[58:49] know made whatever goal I had in my head
[58:52] was that I still didn't um feel that
[58:55] sense of relief for
[58:57] happiness um and so what I think your
[59:00] listeners can learn from myself too
[59:02] apart from me being a musician in this
[59:03] journey is to just um be happy
[59:06] throughout this whole entire journey I
[59:09] know we have all these projections of
[59:11] where bitcoin's going to go and and
[59:13] that's when you know maybe I'll sell off
[59:15] a little bit of my stack and that's when
[59:17] I'll be really happy when I can buy this
[59:19] or do that but I'm telling you right now
[59:21] yeah your quality of life will improve
[59:23] but um you know happiness is is within
[59:27] you just just be happy every day through
[59:29] your journey um and try to live in the
[59:31] moment right now and yes the future's
[59:34] bright but you know when we get to our
[59:36] goal as long as we were happy towards
[59:38] the goal I think that's the most
[59:39] important thing absolutely that's it's
[59:43] it's it's sometimes we believe that uh
[59:45] there there's like this one thing that
[59:47] needs to happen in our life then then we
[59:49] all of the sudden happy then this one
[59:51] thing happens and you realize nothing
[59:54] has changed in your life
[59:57] uh and uh that that's something uh you
[60:00] you learn along the way yeah really cool
[60:02] thank you so much uh Michelle for for
[60:04] already being on uh we have one tin of
[60:07] the podcast uh where the previous guest

[60:23] holding Bitcoin what do you what do you
[60:26] want to do with your Bitcoin um yeah um
[60:30] at some point um use that Bitcoin as
[60:35] collateral um for to to to use as the
[60:39] best pristine collateral to to finance
[60:41] certain deals or art Etc um I think yeah
[60:46] I think I think I think I talked about
[60:48] it extensively maybe so I probably
[60:51] that's that's what I do hold it maybe
[60:53] use it as collateral and
[60:57] try to educate my family on it and make

[61:15] out those 20 questions and if you can
[61:17] fill out in a in a good way and you have
[61:19] like 18 out of 20 right then you might
[61:22] get my Bitcoin in in case of my death
