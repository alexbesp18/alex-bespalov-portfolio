[00:00] K Kelly in El Salvador he's a young
[00:01] president and he got orange pill and he
[00:04] wanted to make huge transformation so he
[00:06] decided not to negotiate with the MS13
[00:09] gang and they went on Killing Spree
[00:12] because of that so pelli called in a
[00:14] state of emergency within a six Monon
[00:16] period he arrested and imprisoned over
[00:18] 65,000 gang members and he took the
[00:20] country from being one of the most
[00:21] dangerous places with the highest murder
[00:23] per capita in the world to one of the
[00:25] the safest places to live in Central
[00:27] America I was ready to move then nobody
[00:29] has the time to even read a book people
[00:31] are so consumed in uh running on the
[00:33] wheel trying to make ends meet to keep
[00:36] up with inflation do you have a
[00:37] prediction for like 2024
[00:41] 2025 how did you find Bitcoin and and
[00:45] why did you stumble upon uh this this uh
[00:49] crazy invention of Satoshi
[00:51] Nakamoto I stumbled upon Bitcoin uh I
[00:54] was looking on social media one day and
[00:56] people were talking about uh what's this
[00:58] cryptocurrency stuff my my investment
[01:01] doubled overnight so it caught my
[01:03] curiosity and I started looking into it
[01:06] I downloaded a wealth Simple app I
[01:09] started buying a bunch of altcoins you
[01:11] know a little bit of Doge little bit of
[01:13] Litecoin a little bit of Bitcoin and I
[01:16] was messing around with them trying to
[01:18] watch them every day going up and down
[01:19] and try to trade them for about a week
[01:22] and I end up losing about
[01:24] $1,000 and then I decided that I really
[01:26] want to look into this and understand it
[01:28] I want to continue to do it but I need
[01:29] to understand it a little better so I
[01:32] started looking up some podcasts and
[01:34] stumbled across a bunch of uh altcoin
[01:38] podcasts and people talking about which
[01:41] coins to invest in how to
[01:43] profit um all that stuff and then I came
[01:47] across what Bitcoin did and I think it
[01:50] was Bitcoin Tina he was interviewing and
[01:53] he started talking about Satoshi and
[01:57] how he invented this thing Bitcoin and
[02:00] nobody can stop it nobody knows who he
[02:03] is and then he disappeared and I just
[02:06] thought to myself this thing is special
[02:08] and I need to know as much as I can
[02:10] about this and I was already down rabbit
[02:12] holes learning about lifespan healthspan
[02:16] all that stuff uh so it was very easy
[02:18] for me to transition over to into
[02:21] Bitcoin and just so I I really got it in
[02:24] a short period of time it only took me a
[02:26] couple days to a week before I was
[02:27] orange pilled myself so
[02:30] uh like I said Bitcoin was talk Tina was
[02:33] talking about all that stuff and then I
[02:35] just started looking for as many podcast
[02:38] as I could and books and I just started
[02:41] just absorbing as much as I could I uh
[02:45] found Tales from the
[02:46] Crypt um and I just binged that it
[02:50] probably took me because it went back to
[02:53] like
[02:54] 2016 or 17 when Mar started that podcast
[02:58] and it took me probably a month or two
[03:01] because I went right back to the
[03:02] beginning and I just put it on 2X and
[03:05] that's all I listen to every day watch
[03:06] everything from the beginning everything
[03:08] right from the beginning and which year
[03:11] was that like how that was Tales from
[03:13] the Crypt yeah what year did you stumble
[03:15] on bitcoin uh in
[03:18] 2021 so you watch that's when Elon was
[03:21] talking about Dogecoin and all this
[03:23] stuff and and and that's what really
[03:26] sparked my interest because I've always
[03:27] been interested in Elon he he's done so
[03:30] many great things just just crazy things
[03:34] and you bought really understand
[03:38] Bitcoin he'll get there he doesn't have
[03:40] time to study Bitcoin he got too much on
[03:43] his plate right now interesting because
[03:46] he only bought Bitcoin with his
[03:48] companies like he mostly talks about
[03:51] Dogecoin when like right now he's not
[03:53] talking about the cryptocurrencies at
[03:55] all like I think since half a year he
[03:57] kind of is quiet about everything
[04:00] cryptocurrency related Bitcoin related
[04:02] do
[04:03] related and but when he started talking
[04:06] about Bitcoin and Doge he mostly talked
[04:08] about Doge but he never bought Doge with
[04:12] any company like SpaceX bought Bitcoin
[04:14] Tesla bought
[04:15] Bitcoin uh and he also went on an
[04:18] interview with KY Woods talking about
[04:22] that he has a significantly higher
[04:25] portion privately in Bitcoin than in do
[04:29] like he always stated that he buys way
[04:33] more Bitcoin than Doge but because of
[04:37] that that he talks so much about do and
[04:39] less about Bitcoin people are assuming
[04:41] he is all in on Doge and doge is for him
[04:44] the main asset but it kind of isn't like
[04:47] it's it's a lot of Bitcoin I see get
[04:50] this wrong and and I think I think he's
[04:52] a he is at this hard bitcoiner he also
[04:56] uh posted some stuff about Austrian
[04:58] economics and high the memes with Salma
[05:01] haek and but theom haek quotes so so I
[05:05] think he actually gets Bitcoin and he
[05:09] chooses not to talk about it for
[05:11] whatever reason but uh of course he has
[05:14] not a lot of time but I think there's no
[05:16] way he does not get it and he has an a
[05:19] CFO at Tesla who really gets it like he
[05:23] talked about Bitcoin and he really gets
[05:24] it and he orange buil him maybe even so
[05:28] uh that's that's that's from from from
[05:30] El but it's fascinating to see well he's
[05:34] such a huge influence right so I
[05:39] mean if if he were to start promoting
[05:41] Bitcoin it would probably be too much at
[05:44] once right yeah and then he has also a
[05:46] lot of capital that he can unlock for
[05:49] Bitcoin whole companies and his private
[05:51] things and he could he could
[05:53] Incorporated in in
[05:55] X that would be something like really
[05:58] having lightning
[06:00] uh like if you you can set them I I send
[06:03] two SS every time I like something like
[06:07] just just small things like that it
[06:09] would completely change the X uh thing
[06:13] you also an X like uh what's
[06:15] your how do you like X now after El took
[06:19] it over did you wear on X before it was
[06:22] called no I I I never I only joined
[06:25] Twitter for Bitcoin Twitter um so I've
[06:29] never been on there before and what was
[06:32] your question again I just if if it was
[06:36] before if
[06:38] you but if you on there just with El you
[06:42] cannot really compare with before right
[06:45] well it it it it allows you to speak the
[06:48] truth now you're not censored right like
[06:51] I go on there and and I'm trying to
[06:53] spread the truth and I I call people out
[06:56] on things I call politicians out on
[07:01] things yeah it's a great platform you
[07:05] also told me that you were planning to
[07:06] move from Canada where you are living
[07:09] right now uh to El Salvador in the next
[07:13] couple of
[07:14] years uh what's your what's your
[07:17] thinking around that like what's wrong
[07:19] with Canada what's what's right with El
[07:22] Salvador well the state of Canada has
[07:25] been declining the last couple years as
[07:27] everybody knows around the world and I
[07:31] don't see it getting any better they
[07:33] continue to just print money
[07:36] exponentially social
[07:39] programs uh they're actually talking
[07:41] about coming up with Ubi now where do
[07:44] that money come from so I I think in the
[07:48] last couple years they added
[07:53] 40% uh more money in
[07:56] circulation uh my house pretty much
[07:59] doubled in
[08:00] value um the price of food has gone
[08:03] through the roof you know they're
[08:05] telling everybody there's five six 7%
[08:08] inflation and we're trying to get it
[08:09] back down but if you look at the numbers
[08:11] of everything it varies inflation isn't
[08:14] a fixed number but if you if I look at
[08:17] my things that I purchase as a
[08:19] contractor and and just you know as a
[08:23] family things have gone up on average
[08:25] between 10 and
[08:27] 50% that's that's a lot higher than five
[08:30] to
[08:31] 7% and they're just gaslighting people
[08:33] right they're telling people that you
[08:35] know you're spending too much money on
[08:37] things that's why there's
[08:39] inflation and telling people that things
[08:42] are actually cheaper than they are and
[08:44] it's just not true so I don't see it
[08:47] getting any better um because they're
[08:50] under the the old political system the
[08:53] old system where politicians it doesn't
[08:56] matter it who they are they just
[08:59] continue to print money and create bread
[09:02] and circus for the populace to distract
[09:05] them it's like uh oh look over here why
[09:09] we print more money to to fund things
[09:11] that we want
[09:14] so
[09:15] buelli in El Salvador he's a young
[09:18] president who who took over and he
[09:20] wanted to make a huge change he
[09:24] um he he discovered Bitcoin beach in El
[09:27] Salvador and he got Orange pilled and he
[09:31] wanted to make a huge transformation so
[09:34] he decided not to negotiate with the
[09:38] MS13 gang that lived there and they went
[09:42] on a killing spree because of that so
[09:45] belli um basically called in a state of
[09:49] emergency and with the six month within
[09:51] a six-month period he arrested and
[09:53] imprisoned over 65,000 gang members and
[09:57] he took the country from being one of
[09:59] the most dangerous places with the
[10:01] highest murder per capita in the world
[10:03] to one of the safest places to live in
[10:05] Central
[10:06] America and even in it has a lower
[10:09] murder per capita rate now than
[10:11] Canada right so when I when I heard
[10:15] about pelli and all this stuff I was
[10:17] ready to move then right I'm very
[10:19] spontaneous and and I can see stuff and
[10:23] and I I make decisions quick but I
[10:25] didn't want to bring that on my wife so
[10:28] I didn't want to like say we need to
[10:30] move out of here and all this so I just
[10:32] slowly started teaching her about
[10:34] Bitcoin and talking about El Salvador
[10:36] and we watched a few podcasts and
[10:39] YouTube videos of people actually on the
[10:41] ground there and talking about it and
[10:42] she looked at me and said we need to
[10:44] move to Al Salvador so my eyes just lit
[10:47] right up I'm like okay what do we do
[10:50] right so we just started planning um
[10:54] it's probably going to take a couple
[10:55] years we have kids in the house older
[10:57] kids that don't want to move move so we
[11:00] got to continue to raise them and make
[11:03] sure that they're uh able to take care
[11:05] of themselves before we move and when we
[11:08] get down there we would like to get set
[11:10] up and try to start to bring people uh
[11:14] with us right sort of like you know take
[11:17] them down on a little free trip and
[11:20] they'll never want to leave again sort
[11:21] of deal I I also think so that has this
[11:26] kind of power um how's the process of
[11:28] mov moving to El salv like what do you
[11:30] need as a Canadian to to move there is
[11:34] there any special like do you have to
[11:37] invest something there I heard something
[11:38] that you have to put down a free Bitcoin
[11:41] and you can have an investment or like
[11:44] uh did you uh did you already research
[11:47] like what do you actually need for yeah
[11:51] we've been talking to a few people and
[11:52] watching some videos um you can you can
[11:55] you can spend Bitcoin or to get a
[11:57] citizenship um
[11:59] now they they offer if you pay million
[12:01] dollars you can get
[12:03] citizenship uh to move their um you need
[12:09] a criminal record back check I can't
[12:12] remember what other the paperwork you
[12:14] need probably some some some usual
[12:17] normal paper stuff but uh you don't have
[12:20] to invest to to move there right no you
[12:23] have to have an income
[12:26] uh like um so you could work online and
[12:30] have income coming from it Source uh
[12:34] essentially you go there you can get uh
[12:37] you can stay there for a year and you
[12:39] have to renew your I can't remember what
[12:42] it's
[12:43] called well what are what are you
[12:45] actually working is that before like
[12:47] real estate and Contracting uh is that
[12:50] something is that like full-time job or
[12:53] what are you working on yeah so I'm
[12:56] self-employed uh I'm a contractor I do
[12:59] kitchen renovation work so that that
[13:03] gives me a lot of freedom I don't have a
[13:05] boss I work all by myself so I don't
[13:07] have a boss I don't have any employees I
[13:09] don't have any co-workers so I'm able to
[13:12] just
[13:14] uh put some headphones on and listen to
[13:17] bitcoin all day while I work I've been
[13:19] doing my job for 20 some years now so
[13:24] I'm pretty comfortable with what I do I
[13:25] don't have to think about what I do at
[13:27] work anymore so I'm able to Focus all of
[13:30] my attention to learning while I'm
[13:32] working the working aspect is like
[13:35] breathing in second nature now
[13:38] so I feel very
[13:41] privileged and I don't take it for
[13:43] granted because um not too many people
[13:48] have have the ability to do that and
[13:50] people nobody has the time to even read
[13:53] a book people are so consumed and uh
[13:57] running on the wheel trying to make meet
[14:00] to keep up with
[14:02] inflation but um yeah as we said before
[14:06] like El musk probably doesn't have time
[14:09] to probably proper proper read a book
[14:13] and and then proper study Bitcoin and I
[14:15] think when he is on the upper scale like
[14:18] he could make that time uh but there are
[14:21] people that just cannot make that time
[14:23] because they in this feeld red race
[14:25] where they have to run from one month to
[14:28] another month just to make with two
[14:31] maybe even three chops to make uh uh
[14:35] roof of the roof over their heads roof
[14:37] over their family heads uh eat something
[14:41] and live some life and for them it's
[14:45] really hard to break out because they
[14:48] can like if if there's nothing up to
[14:50] save it's hard to even save in Bitcoin
[14:53] there's like if there's just no feeld
[14:56] left in the end of the month it's it's
[14:58] hard to uh
[15:01] even pay anything towards towards
[15:04] Bitcoin and they cannot they don't have
[15:06] time to to research about what SAT nakot
[15:10] did and what Bitcoin actually is and
[15:12] listen all day long to to the Fe to
[15:15] bitcoin podcast so it's a really good
[15:17] situation where we are in and I I had
[15:20] this privilege to start asking myself
[15:23] the question what do I do with my money
[15:25] like I don't know if you you heard it on
[15:27] maybe on one or two podcast so even if I
[15:30] even published it but I started I with
[15:34] 18 years old I got some money from my
[15:36] grandma and I this was like 500 like it
[15:40] was not a lot but this was my first
[15:42] money that was just left over because it
[15:44] was 18 not working so uh it was just
[15:47] like what do I do with the money and
[15:49] with 19 I also started working then uh
[15:52] next to school and uh I started the
[15:55] question like what what do I do actually
[15:57] with that energy now and
[15:59] uh I put it in a savings account you can
[16:02] imagine what this this gave me like
[16:05] 0.001% interest like they accumulated
[16:08] two cents in the first
[16:10] quarter uh basically was was giving
[16:14] nothing it was losing in value it was
[16:17] stumbling upon stocks it was stumbling
[16:19] about ETFs and for some reason I found
[16:24] picking individual stock really
[16:26] interesting and really intriguing and I
[16:27] was uh also good or good and lucky uh
[16:32] learned a lot about it and because a lot
[16:35] of because of the success I had with
[16:37] picking stocks a lot of people ask me oh
[16:41] W how do you do it and I went on like a
[16:43] tour like a family to like to this
[16:46] household or this household and
[16:47] explained them how do I pick stocks but
[16:50] the fundamental uh fundamental problem
[16:54] they had they they didn't wanted to
[16:57] learn how to pick stocks they wanted to
[16:59] learn how
[17:00] to secure their financial
[17:03] energy and this is something completely
[17:05] different like picking stocks is a is a
[17:07] is a profession where you have to listen
[17:10] to the the quarterly calls you have to
[17:13] read the 10 qes to 10 K you have to
[17:16] really research what the management team
[17:17] is doing like that's that's proper
[17:19] investing like that's that's completely
[17:22] different to bitcoin and then uh I
[17:24] stumbled upon friends that told me hey
[17:28] there ask this Bitcoin thing you do this
[17:30] investing thing uh what is bitcoin for
[17:32] you like makes this sense and I said ah
[17:35] it's a scam this was in 2019 it's it's a
[17:38] scam I don't like it and in 2020 more
[17:41] and more people are were pushing me
[17:42] about Bitcoin and saying hey what's
[17:44] what's what's this thing about and I
[17:47] actually was on a quest uh on a weekend
[17:50] quest to have good arguments against
[17:53] Bitcoin and this was the weekend where I
[17:57] uh found Bitcoin discovered Bitcoin and
[18:01] because I wanted to find arguments
[18:04] against it but in the weekend I
[18:07] discovered that Bitcoin is actually
[18:08] something really really cool and really
[18:10] really good so uh this was kind of my
[18:14] story and I discovered that the problems
[18:17] I had earlier with the family members
[18:19] that they are wanting a place where they
[18:21] can save Financial energy and not pick
[18:24] stocks this is Bitcoin like Bitcoin is a
[18:27] savings technology for me I kind of
[18:30] rambl B got on a ramp right now I didn't
[18:34] don't even know why I went on
[18:36] this but uh you you watching your
[18:41] podcast you you invested you researched
[18:43] and invested in oh yes Tesla and you
[18:46] said that you went to the factory and
[18:50] you were talking to one of the employees
[18:51] there and you knew more about Tesla than
[18:53] he did oh yes yes yes yes I actually
[18:57] talked with Tesla employee and I knew so
[19:00] much about it uh it's it's uh I was
[19:04] really like I stayed up till 2 am in the
[19:07] morning like I I'm in in Europe in
[19:08] Austria and so I was I'm not in the
[19:11] American time zone so I had to stay up
[19:13] really late to listen to the conference
[19:15] calls and uh I had I put a lot of work
[19:18] in and this whole work then started to
[19:23] focus on bitcoin on finding out why
[19:26] Bitcoin and what what's it what is the
[19:29] Bitcoin technology all about and uh this
[19:32] really opened my eyes as as Bitcoin as a
[19:35] savings
[19:36] technology um but you said it was really
[19:39] quick did you also like uh I went on a
[19:43] portfolio streak where I had almost
[19:46] everything in in Tesla in in stocks and
[19:48] in general and then in one year from
[19:52] zero Bitcoin and 100% stocks to 100%
[19:56] Bitcoin 0% stock and in one you're
[19:58] completely all in like how was your
[20:00] journey was it really like in one two
[20:03] months you all in
[20:05] and well for me it was I allocate a
[20:08] little bit of money and then I like I
[20:10] said as I was learning and as I was
[20:12] learning more and more I was just more
[20:15] convinced that this this was the thing
[20:17] this was the change it was the the the
[20:20] fix to everything so I have zero dollars
[20:24] in my bank
[20:25] account um we recently we're planning on
[20:29] selling our house um again I didn't want
[20:33] to convince my wife of it but uh she she
[20:38] brought it up so we listed it on social
[20:41] media not with an agent but just kind of
[20:43] reach out to people and feel them out uh
[20:46] our plan was to sell the house to
[20:50] somebody who wanted to rent it back to
[20:51] us for a couple of years so that we
[20:53] could pull all the capital out and pay
[20:56] off a little bit of debt and then just
[20:59] put the rest into Bitcoin but we talked
[21:02] to a couple of people and and then she
[21:04] kind of backed out of it so I just left
[21:07] it at that but i' I've been stacking
[21:09] just dollar cost averaging uh ever since
[21:12] I started learning and the allocation
[21:14] has
[21:15] grown um over time and um I'm working as
[21:22] much as I can minimize my expenses so I
[21:26] can spend more on bitcoin
[21:29] and it's conserving my life's energy I
[21:32] look at if you can get one Bitcoin right
[21:35] now the value of one Bitcoin is like
[21:37] 43,000 us if you spend $43,000 on a
[21:42] Bitcoin you're buying like a 100 years
[21:45] of
[21:46] income right like if you can put that
[21:48] away for a few and as that starts to
[21:50] grow in purchasing
[21:52] power it's it's like it's like a money
[21:55] Pop That Never Ends right if if you have
[21:59] 20 years
[22:00] income and it
[22:03] it goes up 5 10 20x every four
[22:07] years then you you you're set for life
[22:11] generational wealth to pass on for for
[22:14] generations to come yeah I also made
[22:17] this experiment today in uh in one of my
[22:20] my my posts on an X um when you take
[22:24] Bitcoin and uh see how many many million
[22:30] quadrillions of Sates there are and
[22:33] divide that number by how many billions
[22:36] of people are there you come to a number
[22:39] of 250,000 Sates per person if we assume
[22:44] the Bitcoin adoption is 100% if we
[22:47] assume there's no Bitcoin left uh no
[22:50] Bitcoins lost there a wrong assumption
[22:53] but if we assume that in the
[22:55] calculation um and if we assume that the
[22:59] distribution about from the Bitcoin is
[23:01] completely equal about all the citizens
[23:05] this would mean with 250 satosi in a
[23:09] future where Bitcoin is completely
[23:11] adopted you can buy now for1 US
[23:15] dollar uh the average net worth of a
[23:18] person and I think it will be even less
[23:21] because it will not be evenly
[23:25] distributed uh it will be the base lay
[23:27] of Financial system uh and
[23:32] um I think not evenly distributed uh it
[23:35] will be
[23:37] um I think this is the main part it's
[23:39] not evenly distributed and there's a lot
[23:41] of lost Bitcoin yet that's what I was
[23:44] missing now uh so it's probably not 21
[23:47] million Bitcoin it's probably
[23:49] 15 14 million Bitcoin so this would lead
[23:54] you with a really low number that you
[23:55] need right now to buy in Bitcoin to be
[23:59] set in life but it depends on how long
[24:03] you look out for like because to have an
[24:06] adoption rate for Bitcoin over 100% or
[24:10] even close to 100% like 80% we will
[24:13] probably need like a lifetime for that
[24:16] like it's it's it's not it will not not
[24:17] happen in in five years or 10 years so
[24:21] it also depends on on how far you go
[24:23] down like I always like when people ask
[24:26] me how many Bitcoin do do I need to
[24:28] retire I'm like depends on the the
[24:31] outcome if you want to stop working
[24:33] today and and live on bitcoin for the
[24:36] rest of your life and you're now 20 you
[24:39] probably need a lot of Bitcoin uh um
[24:42] because maybe it goes down maybe it goes
[24:44] up you you don't know I would not uh
[24:48] focus on that right now but if you are
[24:50] having a long time Horizon and you have
[24:52] a stable income you don't need a lot no
[24:56] no well I mean it took only 15 years to
[24:59] go from zero to 40 some thousand now and
[25:05] that was
[25:06] 93% of issuance with a half a percent of
[25:10] the global
[25:11] population so because of the having
[25:14] Cycles there's there's only less than 7%
[25:18] that the other 99.5% of the global
[25:21] population has to compete for over the
[25:24] next hund and some
[25:26] years so
[25:28] half a percent in a short period of time
[25:31] fighting over 90 some percent brought it
[25:33] to 40 some thousand like the number is
[25:37] it's just going to grow forever right
[25:41] and do you have a prediction for like
[25:44] 2024 2025 do you make price predictions
[25:48] in in Bitcoin well I mean nobody's ever
[25:52] right I I know it's going up and I know
[25:55] it's going to go up a lot there's
[25:56] there's a lot going up on this year uh
[26:00] get the having we have ETF approval
[26:03] within the next couple of days that
[26:06] that's G that's like a having in
[26:09] itself um I would
[26:13] say the diminishing returns is not going
[26:17] to occur this year I I
[26:20] think we're looking at a 10 to 20x from
[26:24] where we stand now is what I we could
[26:29] we could actually have like an super
[26:31] cycle this next cycle I think like this
[26:34] could be a cycle that's completely
[26:36] different than the last Cycles like
[26:40] Michael zor said it so nicely
[26:42] um like if you're having a football game
[26:45] where two teams that are equal in in in
[26:49] in uh in quality and quantity uh you're
[26:54] having a nice game like one one team
[26:56] sets the goal another team sets a goal
[26:59] uh but if you change out some players in
[27:01] the halftime and all of the sudden the
[27:04] best goalkeeper is in the goal and the
[27:06] best attacker is uh in the front and
[27:09] there's like a really good Middle Field
[27:11] and a defender in there like it will be
[27:13] 10 zero because it's like uh the if if
[27:17] the big Big Boy comes in and with big
[27:20] boy I need I I mean now Black Rock I
[27:24] mean mean now AR and all the big funds
[27:27] this just completely changes the game
[27:30] like there's the the the buy volume that
[27:33] will uh occur in in 20124 is unseen like
[27:38] I think not almost no Bitcoin is ready
[27:41] for the bull run that we we we will
[27:43] witness this year no it's like the
[27:46] allocation coming is like it's going to
[27:49] tear faces off like right now there's
[27:52] about I don't
[27:53] know4 Million worth of bitcoin that is
[27:57] minted into existence every day and it's
[27:59] pretty much being consumed as it's being
[28:01] purchased and you're going to have
[28:05] hundreds of millions of dollars a day
[28:07] trying to purchase $40 million worth of
[28:10] bitcoin the only thing that can happen
[28:12] is the number has to go up to to meet
[28:14] that Demand right the price moves on the
[28:17] margin as well so there's the multiple
[28:20] effect um somebody said back in the last
[28:24] Bull Run they figured for every dollar
[28:26] that went into bitco coin it increased
[28:29] the uh overall um uh market cap by
[28:36] 118 so for every dollar going in it
[28:40] increased the am cap by 118 and and the
[28:44] crazy thing is when only when only black
[28:46] rock uh is approved which is not like I
[28:51] think there will be many that will be
[28:52] approved but if only black Ro is
[28:54] approved and if blackr only in invest
[28:57] like 1%
[28:59] allocation uh this will triple the Buy
[29:02] Daily buy volume of of Bitcoin
[29:08] triple yeah and that brings in full more
[29:11] from retail and everybody else and it's
[29:13] just it just feeds on itself right yeah
[29:16] and then you have to consider this 1%
[29:18] will shoot up uh they will have the the
[29:21] clent saying oh no I want 5% I want 10%
[29:23] I want 15% allocation then there are
[29:26] like more fun and they are they they are
[29:29] even now coming in and making
[29:31] advertisement like the the
[29:34] the the some uh ETF funds are now even
[29:39] advertising for a Bitcoin ETF that is
[29:42] not even approved so imagine how much
[29:45] marketing budget how much salese how
[29:48] much eyeballs will be on
[29:50] bitcoin uh in 2024 when the thing is
[29:54] approved plus the whole Capital that
[29:56] it's unlocked it's it's it's crazy when
[29:58] when I hear oh no the it's buy the rumor
[30:02] sell the news it's not it's it's not
[30:04] even close to that no well that's a
[30:06] great point because if you think about
[30:08] it Bitcoin has nothing there's no owner
[30:12] there's no marketing budget there
[30:14] there's nothing and and to get to where
[30:18] it has now with all the
[30:21] success and and now like you said it has
[30:24] a marketing budget now there's going to
[30:27] be millions and millions of
[30:29] dollars to promote this
[30:32] thing
[30:34] so yeah even if you see the community
[30:37] like 2017 it was all about icos it was
[30:40] all about altcoins it was all about or
[30:43] this and that and now there are Bitcoin
[30:46] only podcasts like me like myself and
[30:48] there are a lot more out there like what
[30:50] Bitcoin did you imagine mcne there's so
[30:54] many Bitcoin only podcasts Bitcoin only
[30:58] articles Bitcoin only websites Bitcoin
[31:00] only uh CEOs of really really big
[31:04] companies like Michael zor uh we have
[31:06] Bitcoin only presidents with
[31:08] n um there is a lot coming like we have
[31:12] come far but we are still so early this
[31:16] the saying canot be
[31:18] true this time so um better better stack
[31:23] as many sets as possible because it
[31:27] could be over end of the year like if if
[31:30] we at 1 million US dollar end of the
[31:32] year it's not as attractive as it was uh
[31:36] when you have 20 and also people like oh
[31:39] no I want to wait till it's back at
[31:41] 30,000 or 20,000 really it's going to 1
[31:44] million and you want to figure out if
[31:46] you want buy at 40,000 60,000 or 10,000
[31:50] like it does not matter
[31:53] no so that's uh that's that's my view on
[31:56] it
[31:58] um to wrap the podcast up we have an an
[32:00] end routine uh the podcast where the
[32:03] previous guest asked the question for
[32:05] the next guest and uh the the question
[32:09] for you is what has been your biggest
[32:11] personal belief that you had to destroy
[32:14] in order for you to understand and adopt
[32:20] Bitcoin biggest belief I had to destroy
[32:25] well I always
[32:27] was the type of person I always wanted
[32:29] to find the truth out about everything
[32:31] ever since I was a little kid you know
[32:35] we were lied to but Santa Claus and the
[32:37] Tooth Fairy and all that stuff so at a
[32:39] young age I I always wanted to discover
[32:41] the truth and I always knew that
[32:45] something just wasn't right about
[32:48] Society but when I started learning
[32:51] about Bitcoin it opened up my eyes to
[32:53] what's actually going on and it's just
[32:57] it changed everything right um you know
[33:01] when you read hundreds of books and
[33:04] listen to all the podcasts it just you
[33:08] become
[33:08] awake and you feel bad for everybody
[33:12] because they're they're caught in The
[33:14] Matrix right nobody understands what's
[33:17] going on everybody's being lied to
[33:20] everybody forgets you know you get the
[33:22] next politician in and they forget what
[33:24] the last one did right and then he's
[33:27] blaming the next guy and it's just it's
[33:29] it's a never ending
[33:31] cycle but I think the biggest belief
[33:37] system that I shut down was just was it
[33:40] was that it was
[33:43] like trusting in in our
[33:47] leadership um like I said there was
[33:50] there was some concerns but but I I
[33:53] honestly thought that good leaders
[33:57] would have
[33:59] uh would consider their their people
[34:02] they but they don't right when you
[34:04] really realize that it it's it's all
[34:09] about uh just printing money and you
[34:13] know there there's they get elected
[34:15] they're in for a few short years and
[34:17] their whole role that time their whole
[34:19] focus is on how do I get reelected how
[34:22] do I establish myself with with uh
[34:25] people to be able to benefit myself
[34:27] financially and they're just extracting
[34:30] wealth from from the population and then
[34:33] the next guy comes in does the same
[34:34] thing but I honestly thought that the
[34:36] Health Care system was was there to help
[34:39] people and then I realized it's not a
[34:41] Health Care System it's a sickcare
[34:43] system it's it's there too it's it's um
[34:46] I mean I don't know how it's in in
[34:49] Canada called but in Austria uh it's in
[34:52] German it's it's called Crank house like
[34:54] it's like house for the sick people
[34:57] as you said it's not a it's not a get
[35:00] wealthy house not wealthy get healthy
[35:03] house it's like it's a sick house and
[35:07] yeah they treat the symptoms right
[35:09] that's it they don't they don't look for
[35:10] the underlying cause of of what you're
[35:12] going through they just mask it by
[35:14] treating the symptoms and it keeps you
[35:17] sick medicaments for like oh this then
[35:21] take this and then it's just like when
[35:24] you read it oh it's just a painkiller
[35:27] it's like I I want to know what's wrong
[35:29] with my body uh and want to know like
[35:32] how can I treat it and how can I be more
[35:34] healthy and not how can I like if you
[35:38] hit your toe every day uh on on on the
[35:41] table maybe it's time to stop hitting
[35:43] your toe and not putting on some some
[35:46] painkiller like yeah exactly that's I
[35:49] think it's it's a beautiful I think a
[35:51] beautiful way uh to to to end the
[35:55] podcast I think you you have a unique
[35:58] Bitcoin perspective thank you for
[35:59] sharing it l and
[36:03] um you talk before about maybe you start
[36:07] your own YouTube channel I would really
[36:09] welcome that and maybe we see a la show
[36:12] in in some amount of time so thank you
[36:15] for being on thanks for having me I'm
[36:17] honored have a good one
