[00:00] a lot of people getting scammed if you
[00:02] try to find some of the biggest Bitcoin
[00:04] scams in the past five or 10 years most
[00:07] of them have been in South Africa
[00:09] African currencies are on a downward
[00:12] spiral we need to give everyone the
[00:13] ability to send and receive Bitcoin the
[00:16] naira the shelling the South African Van
[00:19] versus Bitcoin Bitcoin is stable you
[00:21] don't have a choice but to use Bitcoin
[00:23] what do you think is holding us back
[00:26] right now a lot of people don't see
[00:30] I saw you the first time on X I think a
[00:33] few days ago and uh when the African
[00:37] bitcoiners ex Channel declared you as
[00:41] the most impactful person uh in the
[00:44] African bitcoiner space of 20123 and I
[00:46] was like I have to get to know you and I
[00:49] think our podcast audience also wants to
[00:52] to get to know you and what you have
[00:54] done for the African
[00:56] Community um and I saw that
[01:00] uh you also found it to companies so
[01:03] first of all I wanted to know what does
[01:05] it mean to be from the African bitcoiner
[01:08] account the most impactful bitcoiner
[01:10] like what is that from an award where is
[01:12] it coming from and uh why did you get it
[01:16] like what what what have you done uh to
[01:19] achieve that uh
[01:22] achievement okay cool yeah um well yeah
[01:25] I think for the first part of the
[01:27] question probably would be best if you
[01:30] uh got someone directly from the African
[01:33] bitcoiners uh to actually um you know uh
[01:37] give a little history of how that list
[01:41] is uh composed and how it was last year
[01:45] I think this is the second year they're
[01:46] doing it as well so yeah but on my side
[01:50] I could talk about uh the work that I've
[01:52] been doing with regards to exonumia and
[01:55] um machura right
[01:58] so effectively what I'd like to do is
[02:02] accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin
[02:05] across the African continent right so
[02:09] even in both uh companies I don't see
[02:12] myself like as a CEO I see myself as
[02:15] like the Catalyst right so Catalyst by
[02:19] the true scientific definition of the
[02:22] word right like really accelerate uh the
[02:25] reaction without getting burnt out um
[02:28] yeah because I also would like to you
[02:30] know uh do other things out after this
[02:34] but then reasons for why the two
[02:38] companies exist exonumia first reason is
[02:42] um it's a company focused on translating
[02:45] literature that explains how Bitcoin
[02:47] Works into African languages and yeah so
[02:50] the reason behind that is effectively if
[02:53] you are going to have like a Bitcoin
[02:56] Community wherever in the world that
[02:58] you're going to have that community at
[03:00] some point you would want to share some
[03:01] literature for people to consume or for
[03:04] people to understand what Bitcoin is and
[03:08] how it works or whatever else you'd like
[03:10] to share so yeah having that content
[03:12] translated would help so exonumia aims
[03:15] to do that across African
[03:18] continent so far we've had like over 10
[03:21] languages in 10 different countries and
[03:24] yeah uh we will continue doing that
[03:26] although we're going to have to you know
[03:28] figure out how to make it work in a more
[03:31] decentralized version so that we can get
[03:33] to even more countries that we don't
[03:36] necessarily even understand what those
[03:38] people in those countries are saying and
[03:42] two comes to machura so machur is a
[03:46] business that uh gives people without an
[03:49] internet connected device the ability to
[03:52] send and receive Bitcoin and the reason
[03:55] why it exists is effectively the low
[03:59] internet penetration levels across the
[04:01] African continent there's like 30%
[04:03] internet penetration levels across the
[04:06] African continent so if you want people
[04:10] to adopt Bitcoin they need the ability
[04:13] to send and receive Bitcoin right so if
[04:15] a person does not have the ability to
[04:17] send and receive Bitcoin then you know
[04:21] um they cannot participate no matter how
[04:24] much of it they understand they are not
[04:26] doing the one thing that they are
[04:27] supposed to do which is either send hold
[04:31] or receive Bitcoin so yeah so machura
[04:35] primarily works as a ussd service and
[04:39] it's similar to something called please
[04:41] call me in South Africa uh you just dial
[04:44] a number like star one 121 star blah
[04:47] blah blah hash and then your phone knows
[04:51] what to do from there because it's a GSM
[04:53] standard um it's also similar to how
[04:55] mobile money works so mobile money
[04:57] usually people dial the ussd code for
[05:00] the mobile money operator and then they
[05:03] get to send money wherever they sending
[05:05] money so a few things then regarding
[05:09] machura that
[05:11] um pushed me also do it right because
[05:15] one of the things was if uh for me that
[05:18] I was looking at was if the service
[05:20] wasn't going to work well without a for
[05:23] a person without a smartphone I wasn't
[05:25] going to do it right so some of the
[05:28] things you have to think about is on a
[05:30] smartphone you have copy and paste
[05:32] functionality right on a feature phone
[05:34] you may not have copy and paste
[05:36] functionality so things like a Bitcoin
[05:39] address things like a lightning invoice
[05:41] become very unusable on um feature phone
[05:45] because the person may not have copy and
[05:48] paste functionality and if they're going
[05:50] to type it out in full they're going to
[05:51] make a mistake right so for Bitcoin
[05:55] addresses at least you know there's a
[05:57] check some um but uh um you know
[06:00] character length might be too long for
[06:01] most people like 60 characters for them
[06:04] to not make a mistake but at least the
[06:06] check some will check for them and say
[06:07] oh you made a mistake here anyway um the
[06:11] thing that was there that made me feel
[06:13] like okay this can be done was the
[06:15] lightning address so the lightning
[06:17] address is that thing that looks like an
[06:19] email where it's your username at
[06:22] whatever domain so mine is
[06:26] a.mob so whichever country or whichever
[06:30] wallet you're using you could send sites
[06:32] to me ataz
[06:34] a.mob and yeah my users could also type
[06:37] out like if yours is um what Sor post
[06:41] box 47 at wallet of Satoshi or kill
[06:45] Monga 42 at wallet of Satoshi as well um
[06:49] you can then um I can then sends to you
[06:52] by just typing it out right so some of
[06:55] the things you need to understand then
[06:57] with regards to ussd
[07:00] is how it's different from SMS so
[07:04] SMS and ussd are technically the same
[07:08] technology stack but the difference that
[07:11] most normal people would get is that um
[07:14] or normal by normal I mean non technical
[07:17] is that SMS is charged per SMS Cent and
[07:21] ussd is charged at uh the amount of time
[07:24] spent right so within the time intervals
[07:27] you can send as many messages back and
[07:29] forth as you want
[07:30] so it it also has like a 20 second
[07:34] session timeout so yeah um if you do not
[07:38] send a message within 20 seconds your
[07:40] session times
[07:41] out and yeah so within that 20 second
[07:44] you can still send and receive as many
[07:45] messages but 20 second intervals you get
[07:48] charged but um ussd Gateway providers
[07:51] usually then charge you on 60 seconds to
[07:53] make the calculation much easier than uh
[07:55] 20 seconds so yeah I think that is
[07:59] basically the best summary I could give
[08:02] regarding the two services I don't know
[08:04] if you'd have any questions Rob it's
[08:06] it's amazing because I myself live in
[08:09] Austria and here I don't know any single
[08:13] person who does not have a smartphone
[08:15] and another standpoint is I don't know a
[08:18] single person who does not has a banking
[08:21] account but this is not reality in in
[08:23] Africa I uh looked a few numbers up
[08:26] before the podcast and I saw that only
[08:28] like 30 to 40 % in Africa are even
[08:31] banked uh how
[08:33] different uh are Africans viewing
[08:38] Bitcoin because maybe they're not in uh
[08:41] that privileged situation where
[08:43] everybody has a bank account everybody
[08:45] has an internet connection um and this
[08:48] this was also maybe your motivation to
[08:52] make uh ma andura the the mobile service
[08:56] without an internet connection like this
[08:58] is pretty amazing what you're doing and
[09:01] Africans yes yeah
[09:03] so I believe that a lot of Africans view
[09:06] Bitcoin with a lot of interest right and
[09:09] in South Africa specifically which is
[09:11] where I live um that interest has has
[09:16] resulted in a lot of people getting
[09:18] scammed you know if you uh try to find
[09:21] some of the biggest Bitcoin scams in the
[09:23] past five or 10 years most of them have
[09:27] been in South Africa whether MTI Global
[09:30] or those Durban twins who reportedly
[09:34] scam people out of billions I don't know
[09:37] but um yeah so it has also left uh you
[09:42] know a sour taste in a lot of people's
[09:45] mouths so yeah but still the interest is
[09:49] there because the need for Bitcoin is
[09:52] not necessarily just with regards to
[09:54] who's banked and unbanked but with
[09:57] regards to the fact that a lot of of
[09:59] African currencies are on a downward
[10:01] spiral right so um sa Mo has a few
[10:06] podcast episodes and I think probably in
[10:10] a few of his books he where he Compares
[10:12] curreny performances um internationally
[10:16] right and I think he said on average um
[10:20] what is this um currencies INF Fleet at
[10:23] 14% right but then the strong currencies
[10:27] are outliers like um the USD and the
[10:30] Euro but the vast majority of currencies
[10:34] are inflating at a much quicker Pace
[10:36] right so if you have inflation at a rate
[10:40] of 14% you cannot save you cannot um
[10:44] well even you cannot afford the same
[10:46] living standard right so I like to talk
[10:49] about uh my high school days in high
[10:52] school we usually all get to pick a
[10:54] career we usually also pick where we
[10:57] want to be at what point point if you
[11:00] are doing if you are that type of person
[11:02] you could also just go with the flow so
[11:04] I have a friend who was studying
[11:05] Accounting in high school and he decided
[11:09] that okay that will be his career path
[11:12] right and so he also
[11:14] decided how much money he would want to
[11:17] be paid at a certain point for the type
[11:19] of Lifestyle he wanted to have like two
[11:22] kids a two cars and you know a
[11:25] three-bedroom house and at the time it
[11:27] was like 2010 he yeah around 2010 2011
[11:32] he decided that for that type of
[11:34] Lifestyle he would need
[11:36] 600,000 annual income 600,000 Grand at
[11:40] annual income and yeah it made sense
[11:43] back then but 10 years later he will not
[11:47] be able to afford that type of Lifestyle
[11:48] with two kids two cars a three bedroom
[11:51] house right uh because property prices
[11:55] have showed up in the past 10 years uh
[11:57] by probably double right um car prices
[12:01] have showed up also in the past 10 years
[12:03] by more than double so for him to have
[12:06] fought that type of Lifestyle he may
[12:08] have to earn double what he had believed
[12:11] he should have earned right initially
[12:14] instead of 600,000 he should be earning
[12:16] 1.2 million so the issue then becomes it
[12:20] takes a person usually 10 years or five
[12:24] years depending on what how persistent
[12:27] they are 5 to 10 years to get to where
[12:30] they want to get in their career and by
[12:32] the time they get to that point they
[12:34] then discover that the money has lost so
[12:37] much value that they need to recalculate
[12:40] and recalibrate so yeah a lot of that I
[12:42] think is happening through the African
[12:45] continent and a lot of people are then
[12:47] looking for Alternatives and Bitcoin has
[12:49] been this recurring thing that has been
[12:52] coming up in conversations for a lot of
[12:54] people so they're like okay maybe I
[12:55] should try it out and yeah so then for
[12:59] me I look at it as uh from the
[13:02] perspective that okay if it is going to
[13:04] deliver on the promise of being better
[13:07] than money okay um what do we need and I
[13:12] think the first thing we need is
[13:14] everyone with the ability we need to
[13:16] give everyone the ability to send and
[13:18] receive Bitcoin because if you come to
[13:21] me with Bitcoin and you say you want to
[13:22] give it to me if I'm not able to receive
[13:24] it that transaction is not going to
[13:26] happen right and yeah then for the point
[13:29] specifically on the unbanked right part
[13:32] of the reason why the levels of um
[13:35] unbanked people is where it is today is
[13:39] the kyc requirements right so to open a
[13:42] bank account you need an ID and a proof
[13:44] of residents but 50% of the African
[13:48] population does not have an idea of
[13:50] proof of residence so how are they going
[13:53] to open a bank account right and I do
[13:55] not believe that at the current moment
[13:58] um any of the Bitcoin companies are
[14:00] pitching that specifically the fact that
[14:04] oh Bitcoin is just math so for you to
[14:06] open or to use a Bitcoin wallet all you
[14:09] need is an app or calculator depending
[14:12] on how uh integrate you want to be with
[14:14] your use of it and yeah that's about it
[14:17] you don't need to give us your ID you
[14:19] don't need to do whatever um and yeah
[14:22] you could also do this self custodial
[14:24] which is what makes it even more
[14:26] powerful right so if we are going to
[14:28] solve the problems of um unbanked which
[14:32] technically are already being solved in
[14:34] Africa with services like impa that do
[14:38] digital payments via the Telecom Network
[14:40] because even though most people do not
[14:43] have a bank account the vast majority of
[14:45] the people on the continent have a
[14:47] Cellular Connection on feature phones
[14:49] not necessarily on smartphones so do you
[14:51] can you build something that works for
[14:53] people in that regard and that is what I
[14:56] think Bitcoin should be doing as well
[14:59] when you talk about uh all the things
[15:02] you just talked about uh and people are
[15:05] needing Bitcoin to transfer money
[15:06] Bitcoin they need Bitcoin to save their
[15:09] financial energy uh because the currency
[15:13] is just deving in on such a rapid Pace
[15:17] um why like what are the misconceptions
[15:20] people in Africa still have about
[15:23] Bitcoin that not everybody is in there
[15:25] like we still all around the world we
[15:28] have a small percentage still in in
[15:30] Bitcoin only like um small group of
[15:35] informed individuals are using that and
[15:38] you and yourself are working on
[15:41] accelerating that transition but what do
[15:43] you see as the main misconceptions
[15:47] African bitcoiners African no no coiners
[15:50] have to get into Bitcoin I'm asking that
[15:54] question because I'm curious if it's
[15:56] different maybe from uh like a European
[16:02] standpoint yeah well um I think it
[16:05] largely depends which country you're in
[16:08] right so each country and okay let's not
[16:12] even look at countries but the type of
[16:15] person you're dealing with right so a
[16:18] lowincome person one of the major
[16:21] misconceptions they would have with
[16:23] regards to bitcoin is that you need a
[16:25] lot of money to acquire Bitcoin right
[16:28] when you know you could just acquire one
[16:30] set for however many uh Shillings you
[16:32] have in your pocket and Shillings are
[16:34] usually the or some of the weakest
[16:36] currencies in the African continent
[16:39] whether this is no offense to my people
[16:42] whether this is the Uganda shelling or
[16:43] the Kenya shelling usually yeah you but
[16:45] you can get like um one set for like one
[16:49] Uganda shelling actually maybe two
[16:51] Uganda shellings because they also on
[16:53] the downward spiral um $1 is what worth
[16:58] 150 Kenyon Shillings right so you could
[17:01] still get some sets uh with that I think
[17:04] like um a few thousand stats with that
[17:08] but uh then the thing is yeah if you're
[17:10] a lowincome person you believe that you
[17:12] need a lot of money to uh acquire
[17:15] Bitcoin so yeah and this is then the
[17:18] other weird thing and especially for
[17:21] South Africa because it doesn't mean if
[17:23] a person is a lowincome person they are
[17:26] not able to afford expensive things
[17:28] which is weird but um then they don't do
[17:31] it for the right reasons or they go to
[17:33] through the wrong places to acquire
[17:35] their Bitcoin and then they get scammed
[17:37] so it is what it is then uh there's the
[17:39] middle inome people which have their own
[17:42] um misconceptions and usually those
[17:46] misconceptions are rooted in what's the
[17:49] word I'm looking for you know uh maybe
[17:52] trust in the government
[17:55] um yeah and they do not not uh see the
[18:00] need to jump ship some already do but
[18:04] they still trust in the government they
[18:05] still trust in the Pension funds so on
[18:07] and so forth but I think that trust is
[18:10] quickly eroding for most people in the
[18:12] middle class and who else is there oh
[18:15] yeah then the higher class people are
[18:18] also have their own misconceptions
[18:20] because they believe that you know
[18:22] properties is the way stocks are the way
[18:24] so on and so forth which is right but um
[18:28] in some cases it is wrong right and
[18:32] especially if you living in a country
[18:34] with a very volatile political
[18:36] environment such as South Africa and
[18:40] where if you're investing in stocks you
[18:42] generally want to invest in the best
[18:44] performing companies in the whole world
[18:47] not just in the best performing
[18:49] companies in your own country yeah so if
[18:53] you do not have access to those markets
[18:55] then you're losing out but a lot of the
[18:58] uh High income people have access to
[19:00] global markets so it's not a problem for
[19:02] them and then it goes back to the middle
[19:04] inome people who don't necessarily have
[19:07] access to global markets they could if
[19:09] they wanted to but they may not know
[19:12] about that and they still invested in
[19:14] the local markets so yeah then there's
[19:17] something else like no coiners um a
[19:21] Merchants something something something
[19:23] something so Merchants have their own
[19:25] misconceptions as well like um uh new
[19:28] coiners have their own misconceptions as
[19:30] well so I could technically go down that
[19:33] path for the rest of the day but yeah um
[19:36] I I don't know what you say about
[19:39] that that's uh amazing because it's
[19:42] pretty much the same uh what I see with
[19:46] every Bitcoin I ever spoke to like it's
[19:48] it's basically the the I agree with
[19:51] every single class you described I also
[19:55] see in Austria I talked earlier this day
[19:57] with a guy from Australia uh with what
[20:01] with whomever I speak and I often try to
[20:05] get this topic up what are the
[20:06] misconceptions about Bitcoin from
[20:09] non-bitcoin people it's always the same
[20:11] I was curious maybe I never spoke with
[20:13] an African Bitcoin is maybe it's
[20:15] different but it turns out it's a pretty
[20:18] much the same thing
[20:21] and you didn't had this misconceptions
[20:24] or maybe you overcome those
[20:27] misconceptions
[20:28] uh when did you first saw Bitcoin how
[20:31] long did it took you personally to get
[20:33] into Bitcoin and why did you overcame
[20:38] those
[20:40] misconceptions so let me think right uh
[20:44] so for me it's a thing of University so
[20:48] uh generally I was like low income um at
[20:52] the start of University years and as the
[20:54] years progressed um moving in Middle
[20:57] income maybe argue for high income as
[21:00] well specifically for South Africa so
[21:03] for me
[21:05] in University there was a class on
[21:08] bitcoin and the lecture started the
[21:11] class by saying this will not be in the
[21:13] exam so I didn't pay any attention to it
[21:16] and then I think the following year
[21:19] after that I was doing some stuff on the
[21:20] internet and I was offered a payment and
[21:23] I could either accept the payment via
[21:25] Bitcoin or PayPal and yeah I did a
[21:28] assessment a personal assessment I was
[21:30] like okay what am I going to do with
[21:32] this Bitcoin after I receive it right so
[21:34] I had two options the first option was
[21:38] okay well of course accept the Bitcoin
[21:40] but keep it because there's nothing I
[21:42] could do with the Bitcoin second option
[21:44] was accept the payment via Paypal
[21:46] because then you know I could use it uh
[21:49] online on eBay on band camp wherever and
[21:52] then I was like okay cool let me use the
[21:54] bank uh the PayPal option because I have
[21:56] seen some songs on B Cam that I actually
[21:59] wanted to buy and I wanted to get a new
[22:01] laptop you know Dev some more so on and
[22:03] so forth uh great stuff and then the
[22:06] following after that the 2017 bull
[22:09] market is happening and then I'm like
[22:11] hey why didn't I not take the Bitcoin
[22:13] and yeah so then for me it was like oh
[22:16] uh this thing that was worth around
[22:19] $1,000 at the time is now worth 20 us so
[22:24] I missed out on like 20 times uh the
[22:27] value had I just took the Bitcoin and
[22:29] sat on it but of course at the time um
[22:33] what hle was not in my vocabulary right
[22:36] so then what happened oh then the other
[22:39] thing is you know I was you trying to
[22:43] put disposable income somewhere right so
[22:46] then I was looking at options and as I
[22:48] was saying explored stocks explored
[22:51] property explored all of these different
[22:53] things and even as the Bitcoin price was
[22:56] increasing I was like oh I could have
[22:58] then use that money for property blah
[23:00] blah blah blah blah blah but then I
[23:02] started reading up on economics and then
[23:04] started reading up on a lot more on
[23:07] bitcoin and then I was like oh okay so
[23:09] this Bitcoin thing is quite stable and
[23:12] even from an investment perspective the
[23:14] things you're looking for um the
[23:17] Investments where you can put your money
[23:19] in them and then walk away right and
[23:22] then hold for many many years right so
[23:25] this is similar to how waren Buffett
[23:27] does value investing or similar to how
[23:29] Michael sailor feces on investing in
[23:31] Bitcoin goes like yo just buy your
[23:33] Bitcoin and never sell so yeah uh then I
[23:38] came to the same conclusion and then I
[23:40] was like it would be great for other
[23:41] people to uh well specifically people
[23:44] from my communities to learn the same
[23:47] thing about Bitcoin and that's why exi
[23:50] and machura was born uh but even through
[23:54] that um for me there was another thing
[23:57] because I was like um why was I a middle
[24:01] income earner at the time which is uh at
[24:04] my first job and yeah so I think being
[24:09] part of the Bitcoin Community kind of
[24:11] helped me answer that question uh there
[24:14] was a job I applied to but that job
[24:16] would have kept me as a middle income uh
[24:19] earner still so what I did um was look
[24:24] at where I could earn um relatively high
[24:28] amounts right because I'm a software
[24:30] developer and if you do a Google search
[24:34] as a South African for what American
[24:37] Junior software developers are earning
[24:39] you're like wait that's like a million
[24:41] Rands in South Africa so why is it not
[24:44] the case in South Africa where a junior
[24:49] Dev earns what you know uh it's still a
[24:52] good amount of money for South Africa
[24:54] but then it's not competitive globally
[24:57] Okay so so I think it was like 30,000 r
[24:59] or 25,000 R depending on which country
[25:02] you're going to per month and it would
[25:05] be like I don't want to do the math
[25:07] times that by 12 to get what the annual
[25:09] income is and oh yeah it would be like
[25:12] 300,000 RS or 400,000 RS or something
[25:16] like that cool so then I came across
[25:21] some discussions by Bitcoin developers
[25:25] right I think uh the guys is called Z
[25:29] cxmp whatever whatever whatever he just
[25:32] got a grant from spiral and one of the
[25:34] things he said was specifically on the
[25:38] amount of the Grant and on the topic of
[25:42] where he's based right so apparently
[25:44] from his time stamps people assume that
[25:47] he's based in Asia but you know he's a
[25:50] pseudonym so he's saying um technically
[25:53] he's not confirming or denying the
[25:55] assumptions that he's based in an Asian
[25:57] country like the Philippines or Thailand
[25:59] or something like that uh and then some
[26:01] people are then saying um the grant
[26:04] amount is too high for developer in the
[26:07] Philippines or you know that those parts
[26:09] of Asia and his argument is generally yo
[26:13] uh for the living standard that a
[26:17] developer in the US in New York in s
[26:21] Francisco in California wherever else
[26:24] for for for developer in the in Asia to
[26:27] live the very same uh live to have the
[26:31] very same living standard they are going
[26:33] to ultimately have to spend the same
[26:35] amount of money as those developers in
[26:39] New York wherever else in America right
[26:41] so if you look at me right now I'm
[26:42] sweating right so I need air corn in my
[26:45] room because it's a summertime in South
[26:47] Africa right but to have air corn and to
[26:50] afford good air conditioning I would
[26:52] need to
[26:55] effectively what earn the same amount as
[26:57] a person who's living in New York or
[26:59] Europe or wherever else and places that
[27:02] generally have air conditioning in all
[27:05] their homes right so if you are earning
[27:08] the same as a local developer in
[27:10] whichever country you are living you are
[27:13] not able to afford uh the same living
[27:16] standard as a developer anywhere else in
[27:18] the world right well in specifically in
[27:20] the places where those developers are
[27:22] earning the same amount of money so what
[27:25] you generally need to do is move move to
[27:28] those countries where you know you're
[27:29] going to earn um you know top dollar
[27:33] right uh or you could just work promote
[27:35] you and that's the beauty of Bitcoin
[27:37] right so some countries like South
[27:40] Africa we do have um International
[27:42] companies that have headquarters
[27:45] headquarters um in the country
[27:48] specifically AWS I think Microsoft may
[27:51] also have some offices um and yeah so I
[27:54] was like okay let me just uh apply for a
[27:56] job there and then and I caught the job
[27:58] and then I was like okay cool uh this is
[28:00] good living and yeah effectively then
[28:03] for me I never had to deal with those
[28:07] misconceptions per se because uh my
[28:11] journey with Bitcoin is just also been
[28:13] me transitioning between uh income
[28:16] classes hello
[28:19] great yeah yeah I'm still still here and
[28:22] did you
[28:24] ever played around also with Al coins
[28:28] oh yes of course of course right so yeah
[28:31] 2017 bull market
[28:33] I'm then tuning in and all I see is
[28:36] people talking about the next Bitcoin
[28:39] people talking about the silver to
[28:41] bitcoin's gold people talking about y
[28:44] yada all these different things and yeah
[28:46] then I was like okay maybe I should
[28:47] dabble a bit maybe I can also you know
[28:50] since I already missed this Bitcoin
[28:51] train from $1,000 to $22,000 maybe I can
[28:55] you know get catch something else
[28:58] so yeah effectively binance was there I
[29:01] was just putting money on everything
[29:03] getting listed on binance and yeah
[29:07] 2020 well 2018 happened and the bare
[29:10] Market effectively started and it was
[29:13] just like going like this and then you
[29:15] know uh just call Turkey everything went
[29:18] down so yeah for me I was like okay
[29:22] maybe there's something I'm not getting
[29:24] uh but what really drove the message
[29:27] across with regards to altcoins and the
[29:29] dangers of altcoins and why a person
[29:33] should be Bitcoin only was that binance
[29:36] later implemented a dust page right so
[29:40] to anyone who does not know what dust is
[29:42] on binance is if the token you've bought
[29:46] has lost so much value that you cannot
[29:48] trade it on the engine anymore you you
[29:51] go to that page and that page converts
[29:54] it for you into BNB and then hopefully
[29:58] uh the accumulation of your dash tokens
[30:01] can be enough for you to trade that BNB
[30:03] for Bitcoin right so yeah even though
[30:07] that page was there there were some
[30:08] tokens I was unable to even convert into
[30:11] BNB because they were liquid right so
[30:15] yeah that's when I was like okay no more
[30:16]  coining for me and I was Bitcoin
[30:20] all the
[30:20] way yeah so you so basically you went
[30:23] through the um typical uh Get Wrecked
[30:28] and then go Bitcoin only route that a
[30:30] lot of people also me went went through
[30:34] uh I also went through a shitcoin phase
[30:37] as I refer to um you said something that
[30:41] struck me and I noted here you said oh
[30:44] Bitcoin is stable because nobody in my
[30:49] environment thinks that Bitcoin is
[30:51] stable even bitcoiners are like ah it's
[30:53] one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin yes but
[30:56] compared to uh Euro and US dollar like
[31:00] it
[31:01] fluctuates you can say okay one Bitcoin
[31:03] is still one Bitcoin but in our local
[31:06] currency it fluctuates a lot um why did
[31:09] you find uh Bitcoin stable and this this
[31:12] something uh that's normal in Africa
[31:16] yeah sorry about that uh I just wanted
[31:18] to plug something in oh yeah
[31:21] so there's many ways to look at it right
[31:25] so yeah uh think how you look at it is
[31:29] how most people look at it and they look
[31:31] at it relative to their own National
[31:33] currency and determine whether or not
[31:36] it's stable so if you're living in
[31:39] Africa whatever currency you're using
[31:41] the CFA well maybe not the CFA but
[31:44] because the CFA is a stable coin um but
[31:47] the naira the Shilling the South African
[31:51] rand versus Bitcoin Bitcoin is stable I
[31:55] honestly believe that Bitcoin coin
[31:58] African currencies are more volatile
[31:59] than Bitcoin right and adding to the
[32:02] fact that Bitcoin is at least volatile
[32:05] upwards then a person is doing
[32:08] themselves a disservice by using African
[32:12] currency um for that matter and even
[32:15] let's say the CFA which is Africa's
[32:18] stable coin technically it has been one
[32:21] of the few currencies that has managed
[32:24] to keep a stable value in Africa over
[32:27] past 20 30 years even okay maybe not 30
[32:31] because it's it it also has its own
[32:33] dramas where it gets devalued and stuff
[32:36] but um what generally happens is that
[32:42] there's a lot of things you want to do
[32:43] with the CFA that you cannot just do
[32:45] without you know uh the currency passing
[32:48] through France the France Central Bank
[32:51] whatever whatever whatever all that
[32:52] drama you probably should have an
[32:54] episode on the CFA one day if you don't
[32:56] already have one
[32:57] and cool um then the other way to look
[33:01] at it for me is relative to everything
[33:04] else like if you look at um well when we
[33:08] used to have the gold standard and you
[33:10] look at the gold price because what uh
[33:12] the dollar was packed to a certain
[33:15] amount of gold a certain weight of gold
[33:18] and it the chart for me looked similar
[33:21] to bitcoin's chart even now well
[33:26] especially from like 2020 yeah from 2020
[33:29] to like 2023 uh if you look at the gold
[33:32] chart be from 1990 to 1993 man from 1900
[33:37] to 1930 or 1930 to you know you just
[33:41] pick a timeline and for me it felt like
[33:44] okay this is how the Bitcoin price works
[33:46] right and then um I think the Fiat uh
[33:51] stableness is a misconception right
[33:53] because at the end of the day fiat
[33:55] currency is areeg to nothing so whether
[34:00] or not they
[34:02] maintain whatever they maintain is a
[34:06] misconception because they're not packed
[34:09] to anything like okay uh this thing that
[34:12] is a unit upon itself which is not
[34:15] packed to anything else is maintaining
[34:18] its value inflated at rates that are not
[34:22] being officially reported because they
[34:24] don't see money printing as inflation
[34:27] and so on and so forth right so then for
[34:30] me what matters to a person is y you go
[34:34] to the grocery store and you buy Goods
[34:39] at a certain price today right then
[34:42] you're going to go tomorrow then you're
[34:44] going to go next week then you're going
[34:46] to go next month it's impossible for you
[34:49] to pay the same prices for whatever you
[34:53] were buying today as you would buy
[34:55] tomorrow and and next week and next
[34:57] month and next year it's close to
[34:59] Impossible right no matter what currency
[35:02] you're using because we are living in a
[35:04] world that has entropy in it right so um
[35:08] Fiat and
[35:10] industrialization aims to create this
[35:14] artificial stableness right it's good
[35:17] for big corporate but it's impossible to
[35:20] achieve that's why we have Futures
[35:22] market so that uh the cost of
[35:25] um what productive Goods I think that's
[35:28] what it's called can be paid at a set
[35:31] price so that a big corporate can budget
[35:33] for stuff but what usually should have
[35:35] happened is yo just the price
[35:37] yesterday's price is not today's price
[35:39] as F Jo would say because you know we
[35:42] live in a world of entropy something
[35:44] happened fuel prices went up it rained
[35:47] the roads were not as um good to drive
[35:50] one as we expected so there was a delay
[35:53] so demand and Supply had to play a role
[35:55] so on and so forth so yeah ultimately I
[35:57] believe that uh that is thing that thing
[35:59] is uh Fiat stableness is an artificial
[36:03] construct and yeah um the other way
[36:06] though my preferred way of looking at
[36:08] Bitcoin stability is the fact that
[36:11] regardless of whatever is happening in
[36:13] the world Tik Tok next block right so
[36:16] regardless of well well specifically the
[36:19] one Bitcoin is cost to one Bitcoin
[36:21] that's very important but um you know
[36:24] that despite the political landscape
[36:29] despite the geospatial uh geopolitical
[36:32] uh landscape Wars genocides anything
[36:34] happening in the world Bitcoin is still
[36:37] functioning and in fact if you're a
[36:39] country at War you are incentivized well
[36:42] not really incentivized because you
[36:44] don't have a choice to but to use
[36:46] Bitcoin your Central Bank may not be
[36:48] functioning especially in the early days
[36:51] of the war as we saw in Ukraine um so
[36:54] what are you going to do right so yeah
[36:56] for me that's why I think Bitcoin is
[37:00] stable right it's amazing uh explanation
[37:03] actually thank you for that um you are
[37:06] trying also I saw something on your
[37:09] Tweet timeline with Bitcoin Cape Town
[37:12] and Bitcoin
[37:13] eazi um can you quickly also go over
[37:16] what that is and what's your involvement
[37:18] in there or are you not involved in that
[37:20] did I uh misinterpret that no you you
[37:23] you're correct we hosting adopting
[37:26] Bitcoin
[37:27] cave town so co-hosting it with Bitcoin
[37:31] Ai and the great people who ran adopting
[37:34] Bitcoin and yeah so feel free to come
[37:38] through everyone it's going to be a very
[37:40] great uh conference we aim to bring
[37:43] through what what is this well of course
[37:47] the best Bitcoin companies around the
[37:49] world but also what we doing we are
[37:53] bringing parallel institutions um to the
[37:57] space right because one of the things
[37:59] that work very or some of the things
[38:01] that work very well in South Africa are
[38:04] because there's parallel
[38:06] institutions um institutions that are
[38:09] not necessarily government institutions
[38:11] but at the same time you know uh the
[38:14] government is in a pickle um or puts us
[38:16] in a pickle because we end up being gry
[38:19] listed and all of these different things
[38:21] so you have to ask a question of how do
[38:24] these parallel institutions continue
[38:27] delivering the great services that they
[38:30] are delivering without um good enough
[38:34] money you know um money that they could
[38:36] easily send to whoever they need to send
[38:39] it to and receive it from whomever they
[38:42] needed to send to receive it from right
[38:44] so if you're an entrepreneur if you're a
[38:47] parallel institution and you have to
[38:49] fill out five forms to receive a payment
[38:51] and six forms to send a payment you are
[38:55] losing time that could be better spent
[38:58] doing something else so yeah what we
[39:00] want to do is
[39:02] effectively bring these people together
[39:05] right and show them that oh okay cool uh
[39:08] you guys are doing great work but you
[39:09] should consider using Bitcoin oh you
[39:11] bitcoiners are doing great work but you
[39:13] should consider building stuff for these
[39:15] people so yeah that is what we doing
[39:18] with adopting Bitcoin K toown we have a
[39:20] few great speakers lined up uh notable
[39:23] um honorable mentions as Anita porch of
[39:27] course she's been all around Africa uh
[39:30] trying to you also accelerate uh the
[39:33] adoption of Bitcoin across the continent
[39:35] and Carol F uh this is a guy who built
[39:38] out crypto convert and he's also
[39:40] co-founder of lunar and crypto convert
[39:43] is basically the reason why you can go
[39:45] to any Pick and Pay in South Africa and
[39:48] pay using a lightning wallet through his
[39:50] app which converts the QR code that they
[39:53] show you at the till into a lightning
[39:55] invoice and and a few other notable
[39:58] people like Craig Ro he's the guy who
[40:00] built Spyro wallet and Herman from
[40:03] Bitcoin of course if you haven't been to
[40:05] muscle Bay the third day of the
[40:07] conference is going to have a road trip
[40:08] to muscle Bay not for everyone so talk
[40:11] to us nice and then we're going to add
[40:13] you on that road trip if you don't talk
[40:15] to us nice you can find us in mcle Bay
[40:18] the next day of course if you want to
[40:20] make your own trip there you are invited
[40:23] and Jimmy song is also coming he's one
[40:26] of the best authors in the space or one
[40:29] of the best Minds in the Bitcoin space
[40:32] um and yeah uh read his books uh his
[40:35] latest book is fat ruins everything and
[40:38] yeah highly recommend you read that book
[40:41] and myself I'm going to be there but
[40:43] another highlight is marel from Bitcoin
[40:45] Dada all the way from Kenya and she runs
[40:49] an organization fully focused on giving
[40:52] women a space in the Bitcoin um
[40:55] ecosystem you know you know because she
[40:57] one day went to a Bitcoin meet up in
[40:59] Kenya and she was like I'm the only
[41:01] female here apart from the girl who came
[41:04] with her boyfriend who and the boyfriend
[41:06] was there attending and the girl was
[41:07] just there to show support and yeah so
[41:11] Paco run with Bitcoin he was here last
[41:13] year so he's coming back to South Africa
[41:15] once more to be here with us and yeah
[41:18] Ray Yousef from CIT noan and yeah if you
[41:22] do know do not know who Ray Yousef is he
[41:25] basically is one of the um hearts that
[41:28] are P he'll be talking to us there and
[41:31] there's a few people from the what is
[41:33] this parallel Market uh track oh and Tom
[41:36] from M as well great people great
[41:39] company uh he'll be there uh Russell
[41:41] larti from sea probably not pronouncing
[41:45] that correctly but he also has a great
[41:47] book I think it's on the fall of um the
[41:51] Zim dollar and who else John Andre from
[41:55] The Institute of race relations there's
[41:57] someone from the free
[41:59] cities Institute of free private cities
[42:03] but doesn't seem to be on the website
[42:04] which is something we need to fix and
[42:06] yeah our host will be Jun Nakamoto uh
[42:10] well most people know him as a
[42:11] journalist from Quin Telegraph but he's
[42:13] doing a lot of great
[42:17] stuff yeah it sounds like a a great
[42:19] lineup of great Bitcoin minds and I love
[42:22] that you also so involved you are trying
[42:25] to accelerate the whole Bitcoin adoption
[42:28] movement you're accelerating basically
[42:30] sound Money Getting freedom to freedom
[42:34] and hope to uh all those eight billion
[42:37] peoples on on the earth um for uh
[42:40] getting to the end of the podcast what
[42:43] do you think is holding us back right
[42:46] now to really have an accelerated
[42:49] Bitcoin adoption what do you see holding
[42:52] us uh as a collective group as humans
[42:56] society as humans on on Earth uh back
[43:00] from adopting Bitcoin to like 50%
[43:04] adoption 60% adoption 100% adoption what
[43:08] are your the main thoughts about
[43:11] that so I think
[43:15] mainly a lot of people don't
[43:19] see that a lot of people are not using
[43:22] Bitcoin right so I think if you could
[43:26] see and understand how very little
[43:29] people in the greater scheme of things
[43:32] are using Bitcoin
[43:33] today um yeah you would approach things
[43:37] a little different and a lot of the
[43:40] arguments we are having I feel like they
[43:43] are theoretical when they should already
[43:45] be practical because we at a point in
[43:48] time when the use case for Bitcoin is
[43:51] being proven right if um the
[43:55] main
[43:57] value uh present for Bitcoin is the fact
[44:00] that what what what am about to say oh
[44:02] the fact that it's
[44:04] um not an inflationary currency right um
[44:09] in fact it has a cap so that it doesn't
[44:12] get inflated away and countries like
[44:14] turkey
[44:16] Argentina Nigeria Kenya even South
[44:19] Africa with the Rand are experiencing
[44:21] very high levels of inflation then
[44:24] people in these countries should be
[44:26] already embracing Bitcoin right um I'm
[44:30] usually trying using the statement that
[44:34] drug sell themselves right so if a
[44:37] person is trying to have get a fix and
[44:41] in this case Bitcoin is the fix for them
[44:44] it's not too hard for a drug dealer to
[44:46] sell to this person right so why is it
[44:50] so hard for Bitcoin to get where it
[44:53] needs to go and I believe it's because a
[44:56] lot of people do not understand that a
[44:58] lot of people don't use Bitcoin right so
[45:02] if you approach it from that perspective
[45:05] um the first question you have to ask is
[45:07] what do the things that result in people
[45:11] using Bitcoin actually look like so
[45:15] yeah oh great um how do you see
[45:20] cbdcs um for for for us Europeans and
[45:24] also I think America especially actually
[45:26] cbdcs is some word they they really
[45:30] fearful of they fearful of the
[45:33] possibilities That central banks are
[45:35] given uh more than just the money
[45:38] printing it's more about State Control
[45:41] it's about monitoring the citizens um
[45:45] how is cdcs uh rolling out in Africa how
[45:49] do you see the developments
[45:51] there well um I think as cbdc already
[45:55] tried being
[45:57] um rolled out in what was this Nigeria
[46:00] the EA specifically I don't know if it's
[46:03] a full-fledge cbdc but it's the in Era
[46:05] anyway and the people rejected it you
[46:08] know like after year only 1% of the
[46:10] population had used it so I guess that
[46:15] is effectively the biggest hurdle that
[46:19] cbdcs are going to have to overcome like
[46:22] why would people even use it in the
[46:24] first place right
[46:26] so yeah so cbdcs for me are a nonf
[46:31] factor because like who the hell will be
[46:33] using it and a person who will be using
[46:36] a cbdc generally does not have a problem
[46:39] with it unless of course you're talking
[46:42] about people in aarian States but I
[46:46] don't believe that Austria is in aaran
[46:49] state in in your regard so we have
[46:52] nothing to worry about with regards to
[46:54] cbdcs no matter how bad they may sound
[46:57] uh at the end of the day you actually
[47:00] have to use it for it to cause you harm
[47:03] right
[47:03] so yeah um I don't see a reason why a
[47:07] person would use a cbdc in the same
[47:09] fashion that we saw people in Nigeria
[47:12] not using the EA and just sticking to
[47:15] whatever options were there for them
[47:17] until the government even uh you know
[47:21] pulled back some of the efforts that
[47:23] they were putting towards the cbdc
[47:26] that's an interesting perspective I
[47:28] think a lot of European bitcoiners are
[47:31] uh really fearful of an cbdcs and the
[47:35] possibilities and uh but I agree with
[47:38] you uh why should people use that it's
[47:41] it's I mean some people um fear that the
[47:44] government is trying to incentivize the
[47:46] cbdc really really hard like for example
[47:49] you get better benefits uh you get more
[47:52] freedom for cbdc at first that that it
[47:55] gets adopted and people are getting used
[47:57] to it like but there are a lot of
[47:58] fearers around it uh right now I don't
[48:01] see uh the the fear also as you said and
[48:05] I also ask myself a question why would
[48:07] you use it but on the other side I step
[48:11] out of the bubble and see uh normal
[48:14] uncles and aunts from me and they're
[48:16] just using whatever the governments tell
[48:18] them to but the enira as you said this
[48:21] was a project and I followed that
[48:22] project it was not used at all and I
[48:24] think it has like a option rate of 1% or
[48:27] something like 99% of the people just
[48:29] rejected it so I I agree with you and uh
[48:33] I I'm looking forward how this whole
[48:35] thing involves and and another point I
[48:38] would like to add for the cbc's when did
[48:40] the government ever created some good
[48:42] technology that people wanted to use and
[48:46] there's a reason why all the phones are
[48:48] made from private companies and not from
[48:49] the
[48:50] government exactly um I have an Andro
[48:54] team on the on the podcast where the
[48:57] previous guest uh ask a question for the
[49:01] next guest without knowing who is the
[49:04] next guest so the previous guest asked
[49:07] you a question without knowing you and
[49:10] the question for you is what price would
[49:13] Bitcoin need to hit the coming cycle for
[49:17] you to sell and no price is not an
[49:22] answer oh okay so weird enough like uh
[49:25] um I don't have Fiat right I get paid in
[49:28] Bitcoin so technically I'm selling
[49:31] Bitcoin every month depending on how you
[49:32] look at it because I have expenses right
[49:36] so I would have already died if I didn't
[49:38] sell uh so yeah uh technically whatever
[49:42] price um it hits on the month that I get
[49:46] paid is the price for me right it could
[49:49] be one Rand if one Bitcoin is worth one
[49:52] Rand I'll still be getting paid in it so
[49:55] we yeah but I'll pay for food um
[49:58] groceries rent and everything else so
[50:01] for some of these things I don't have to
[50:03] sell the Bitcoin because I can buy them
[50:05] directly as I said in South Africa you
[50:07] can go to a grocery store and you know
[50:09] pay with lightning for your groceries um
[50:13] I've orange build my landlord so I can
[50:15] pay in Bitcoin uh for the rent and so on
[50:18] and so forth so yeah so whatever price
[50:20] it is on the DAT could even be one Rand
[50:23] it could even be a million dollars I i'
[50:26] I'd be spending Bitcoin I'd be living on
[50:30] bitcoin that you are completely on a
[50:33] Bitcoin standard and in your superar
[50:36] like in your area is is it normal that
[50:39] supermarkets are accepting
[50:42] lightning well not really right but um
[50:46] there's a lot of strong bitcoiners that
[50:48] made it happen as I said uh Carl Van who
[50:51] worked and build is building still
[50:54] building crypto convert and made sure
[50:56] that I think probably the second largest
[50:59] uh grocery chain in the world is the one
[51:02] accepting Bitcoin and yeah so it's quite
[51:06] normal for you to live in an area that
[51:08] has a pick and pay and can just go down
[51:10] there and just uh buy whatever you want
[51:12] and pay using um lightning and I think
[51:16] Paco was also um in South Africa and he
[51:19] made a few videos about it and even if
[51:22] you don't want to use crypto convert you
[51:24] can still use
[51:26] which has uh pck and pay Checkers and
[51:28] Shop right so yeah so you if you want to
[51:32] live on a Bitcoin standard in South
[51:34] Africa you can buy your clothes buy
[51:36] furniture do everything else but you
[51:39] know for rent and other things you'd
[51:40] have to do the orange pilling yourself
[51:43] uh instead of waiting for somebody else
[51:44] to do that orange pilling on your
[51:47] behalf and that's great I love I love
[51:50] the Grassroots movement that you are
[51:53] contributing to that you Accel in the
[51:55] Bitcoin adoption and I love to have L to
[52:00] have you on uh it was a great pleasure
[52:03] and an honor to talk to you thank you
[52:05] thank you for having me
