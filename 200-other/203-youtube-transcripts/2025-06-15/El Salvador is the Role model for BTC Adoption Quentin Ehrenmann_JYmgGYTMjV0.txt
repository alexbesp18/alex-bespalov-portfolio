[00:00] when you go to Western countries it's
[00:02] it's terrible it's the way of the
[00:04] Salvador approach Bitcoin a role model I
[00:07] think we're going to speed up the
[00:08] timeline of Bitcoin adoption thanks to
[00:09] that leave your life somewhere else and
[00:11] just get on a plane with all your
[00:14] Bitcoin and nobody can stop you how do
[00:16] we get the world to adopt Bitcoin this
[00:19] is when it makes sense to get on a
[00:21] Bitcoin standard and earn in Bitcoin as
[00:24] well you were leaving from France you
[00:27] were going to Salvador you moved a lot
[00:29] around you experienced a lot in your
[00:31] life already um what what does self
[00:34] sovereignty mean to you what does it
[00:36] mean to be
[00:38] self-sign that's a great question uh so
[00:42] self- sovereignty for me would be
[00:44] freedom of uh Choice freedom of speech
[00:47] and freedom of movement uh and this is
[00:50] why I think Bitcoin is so important
[00:52] right is that you can leave your country
[00:54] and just
[00:55] go travel or just leave your life
[00:58] somewhere else and
[01:00] just get on a plane with all your
[01:03] Bitcoin if you choose to do so and
[01:05] nobody can technically stop you right
[01:09] you can see the signs like when you
[01:11] arrive in the United States for example
[01:12] you can see like
[01:14] $10,000 uh if you have more than that in
[01:17] cash or you have to declare everything
[01:19] and anything that you have and uh a week
[01:22] ago I did something a bit stupid but but
[01:24] that worked
[01:25] I got on the plane and I passed the
[01:28] security the TSA
[01:30] uh with like two Bitcoin metal backups
[01:33] and much more and even that worked I
[01:36] mean they were empty so it was for
[01:40] testing um but yeah self- sovereignty I
[01:43] guess it's being able to
[01:46] do uh things that you feel you need to
[01:49] do and that nobody can stop you from
[01:52] doing them H that's amazing and you also
[01:55] like left France right you you start you
[01:59] like you were born in France at some
[02:01] point you left uh France why did you do
[02:03] that uh so I left in early 2022 so I got
[02:09] really blackpilled by the covid and and
[02:12] not really the co but everything else
[02:15] but the the disease right like the the
[02:17] response from the government and the
[02:19] response to the government's actions uh
[02:23] from the citizens friends family and uh
[02:28] being cast out
[02:30] of society for not
[02:32] accepting the mainstream narrative and
[02:35] then the vaccine and everything and so I
[02:38] got in a very very dark place
[02:42] um and then I said it I'm gone and
[02:45] I left to to go travel uh bought a car
[02:48] travel in France for three four months
[02:51] and then I said okay I I went around
[02:54] France that was cool I went in I went to
[02:56] Belgium I went to Spain now I need to
[02:59] take a a bigger step and so I sold the
[03:02] car and I packed a 5 kilo backpack and I
[03:07] went to Mexico for six months and that's
[03:10] how it started oh Mexico it's like it's
[03:13] fascinating how everybody is choosing
[03:15] Mexico I interviewed Luke mikage also
[03:18] and he also went to Mexico Mexico first
[03:22] um maybe that's like why is like I think
[03:26] his reason from Luke mikage was Mexico H
[03:28] was his only troice
[03:30] like he was also after covid in in in
[03:33] Australia and with his medical status
[03:36] Mexico was literally the only country
[03:39] that was accepting him was this also the
[03:41] case or did you had some specific reason
[03:43] why Mexico yeah it was the same so I
[03:46] think I could have gone to El Salvador
[03:50] directly but I had never gone uh
[03:53] traveling alone for 6 months and I was a
[03:56] bit afraid of and and it will sound
[03:59] weird but not having enough places to go
[04:02] travel to and having to come back home
[04:05] uh too soon and so between El Salvador
[04:09] and Mexico I said well for six months
[04:12] I'd rather go to Mexico and and be able
[04:15] to to roam the whole country right so I
[04:17] chose Mexico and in the end I uh
[04:20] continued traveling uh to Guatemala and
[04:23] I cross the border to El Salvador and
[04:25] here I am uh did you go to El Salvador
[04:29] then because because of Bitcoin or why
[04:32] yeah so so in Mexico I met uh this girl
[04:36] Sam who's my girlfriend now and so we
[04:40] traveled together and at some point we
[04:41] said let's cross the border and go to
[04:43] Guatemala so we went there we traveled
[04:45] for a
[04:46] month and at this point I had my return
[04:49] flight uh like in a week or something
[04:52] and I said well I might not take it and
[04:55] so I didn't take it and we decided to
[04:58] continue and travel to Salvador like
[05:00] just going south and um yeah yeah I
[05:05] guess I I really wanted to to see what
[05:08] uh the country and and the legal tender
[05:11] law was all about um at first when I was
[05:14] still in France I was not that excited
[05:16] by the legal tender law I I thought it
[05:19] was something that was very um toped
[05:21] down and that's not the way I see things
[05:25] and then I went and I checked for myself
[05:28] and I found that the legal tender law
[05:31] doesn't um impose anything on people you
[05:35] don't see people being prosecuted for
[05:37] not accepting Bitcoin that's not
[05:39] happening uh so so it's just giving like
[05:42] a legal framework uh for it to
[05:46] be usable let's say and
[05:49] so yeah I arrived in El Salvador and I
[05:52] was very very uh pleasantly surprised by
[05:57] uh by that and and this is when I I
[05:59] discovered that there was a project
[06:01] called me premere Bitcoin that was doing
[06:04] uh Bitcoin
[06:05] education uh not top down like it was
[06:09] the the counter measure to the top- down
[06:11] uh legal tender law it was like
[06:13] Grassroots Bitcoin education for the
[06:16] masses in El Salvador and so I I got
[06:19] really interested I met with the team
[06:21] multiple times uh I went on several
[06:25] graduations and did some back and forth
[06:28] um uh going back to Mexico and and in El
[06:32] Salvador and at some point I got called
[06:34] back by John the founder and he offered
[06:37] me the opportunity to go back to an
[06:39] island on which there had been a
[06:43] graduation and uh he offered me the
[06:46] opportunity to go there for six months
[06:49] and uh Kickstart uh Bitcoin circular
[06:52] economy with uh social projects and
[06:55] education and everything and I went we
[06:59] stayed there for six months with Sam and
[07:02] it was an incredible experience like
[07:04] life-changing kind of experience in
[07:06] terms of uh you know just living new
[07:11] experiences every day is is amazing uh
[07:15] and where was this place again where you
[07:17] like this was at Salvador already or
[07:19] what yeah yeah so it's an island called
[07:21] uh
[07:23] laaya yeah it's it's so it's an island
[07:26] but it's actually located in a mangrove
[07:28] so if you look at the map it's not like
[07:29] far away far away from the shore it's
[07:32] kind of connected but it's like Mangrove
[07:35] so it's it's pure seawater with trees so
[07:38] it's completely isolated you can only go
[07:40] there by boat okay and and now with your
[07:44] few on you have France you have Mexico
[07:47] uh you have El Salvador um is the way
[07:51] it's going now in El Salvador is the way
[07:53] also a Salvador approach Bitcoin a role
[07:57] model or or differently ask uh what
[08:00] should other nation states that also
[08:03] want to adopt Bitcoin as legal dender
[08:05] maybe do differently do you see any
[08:06] improvements on the process to getting
[08:08] to this uh legal tender
[08:10] status so that's that's a great question
[08:13] I don't think the legal tender law is is
[08:15] something that is uh necessary like it's
[08:18] something that El Salvador did as a as
[08:21] sending a message right like we're
[08:23] accepting Bitcoin officially legally it
[08:26] was a political statement I'm sure there
[08:29] there's going to be Bitcoin
[08:30] adoption everywhere in the world uh
[08:33] without legal tender laws and that's the
[08:35] point right we we don't need uh the
[08:37] approval we we we don't need the the
[08:40] stamp from uh
[08:42] politicians um but yeah I think it it
[08:45] was um maybe the right way to do it um
[08:51] but more than that I think like the
[08:53] whole world is a labor laboratory for uh
[08:56] Bitcoin adoption and so it's like like a
[08:59] Petry box we we need all kinds of stuff
[09:01] in there and and see what's the best
[09:04] recipe for bitco adoption and probably
[09:06] the recipe will defair um depending on
[09:09] the on the region the the culture the
[09:13] political system and and everything like
[09:16] every kind of variable that you can
[09:18] think of but um yeah I think El Salvador
[09:21] did right to do it this way there's
[09:22] still a lot of work that needs to be
[09:24] done um like writing a law is the easy
[09:28] part right
[09:30] yeah and it's it's so fascinating
[09:31] because I think in the whole game theory
[09:33] when we think about how Bitcoin will
[09:35] play out the early adopters will
[09:37] obviously benefit more than the late
[09:41] majority uh to to bitcoin obviously but
[09:44] still like I always like to note that
[09:46] even the last person even the last
[09:48] Nation adopting a Bitcoin standard will
[09:50] still benefit from a sound money
[09:52] standard uh but in a game theoretical uh
[09:57] sphere where you have let's let's take
[10:00] European Union with France Germany
[10:02] Austria like you come from France I'm
[10:04] I'm still based in Austria uh and then
[10:07] you have Salvador like five years ago it
[10:11] was pretty clear where people want to
[10:13] live more France more Austria Les
[10:15] Salvador nowadays the murder rate was
[10:18] going down there's more and more
[10:21] entrepreneurship startup spirit I think
[10:23] in in in Salvador like uh this this
[10:26] changes a little bit the weight of of
[10:28] the countries and where people want to
[10:30] live um how do you see this whole game
[10:32] Field playing out especially when you
[10:34] look back at your home country France
[10:38] like what what has Frost to do to to get
[10:41] you
[10:42] back and and it's like how do you see
[10:45] this whole whole Theory playing out that
[10:48] that's a great question so so to answer
[10:50] the the latter part of your question um
[10:54] so France has uh food which is amazing
[10:57] food red wine uh uh cheese everything
[11:01] and and I just come back from um France
[11:04] actually I spent a month a month there
[11:07] after two years and it was great as a
[11:10] tourist right but you can feel in the
[11:13] air that people are like prices are
[11:16] going up uh wages are not uh everyone's
[11:20] struggling um there's this weird vibe
[11:25] where it's it's like it can only go down
[11:28] from there like we had our Peak and now
[11:32] it's
[11:33] just
[11:34] downhill uh whereas in
[11:39] Salvador there is a lot missing like
[11:42] there's a lot to be
[11:44] done but you can feel it that people are
[11:48] more optimistic every week every month
[11:52] uh there are new things happening and
[11:56] especially here in Berlin where where I
[11:58] live there's this bit Community called
[12:00] uh Bitcoin
[12:01] Berlin
[12:03] and it's wonderful to see people from
[12:07] all around the
[12:08] world come to this little mountain town
[12:12] and start building things together and
[12:15] start exchanging ideas and enthusiasm
[12:19] and it's just beautiful and you don't
[12:21] have that in France like you have
[12:23] Bitcoin
[12:24] meetups but then again there's not this
[12:27] uh energy this positive energy that that
[12:30] pushes people collectively to do great
[12:33] things and this is what I see in El
[12:35] Salvador and uh talking about Game
[12:38] Theory and and and uh what people have
[12:41] to win or to lose or what's what's the
[12:45] the the
[12:47] stake I think the legal tender law again
[12:51] was was a a bold
[12:53] move just like everything else that
[12:56] happened in the country in the last
[12:57] years uh but they had literally nothing
[13:00] to lose so um it was it was a an
[13:06] asymmetrical bit as we as we call it
[13:08] right and so we're we're witnessing it
[13:12] right now that it's
[13:14] it's only positive things are uh coming
[13:18] from this and more and more positive
[13:21] things will be coming in the
[13:23] future you you you only have to think
[13:26] about the amount of Bitcoin that the
[13:28] government holds
[13:30] uh again uh we can we know that the
[13:33] government can go evil right so uh it's
[13:36] not something that we should cheer uh
[13:38] blind blindly but if you just think
[13:41] about it like the more the government
[13:42] saves in Bitcoin the more uh purchasing
[13:45] power it will have for its people
[13:47] ideally and so that's crazy like Western
[13:52] countries have to print money and
[13:55] debasing their currency and everything
[13:57] just to continue financing
[14:00] themselves and you have the government
[14:02] of El Salvador that sees um it's
[14:05] purchasing power it's it's uh potential
[14:08] budgets go up over
[14:10] time and that's that's just crazy to
[14:13] think about like they're going to have
[14:17] so much monetary power to improve the
[14:20] country in the coming years it's it's
[14:23] just it's going to be crazy like the
[14:26] growth will be something to to see and
[14:30] I'm sure it's going to bring its a lot
[14:33] of challenges as well right um but yeah
[14:36] I'm very excited about that it's amazing
[14:39] and you I mean I think I heard Max and
[14:42] Stacy say something like getting an
[14:45] Salvador now is like getting in Bitcoin
[14:47] in
[14:48] 2011 which is a crazy thing to think
[14:51] about yeah probably I don't know I think
[14:55] I would rather have uh entered Bitcoin
[14:57] in 2011
[14:59] but uh yeah I I understand maybe maybe
[15:03] in terms of land I know that land is
[15:04] going to go up as well like it price is
[15:06] going to go maybe not as much as Bitcoin
[15:08] but I think land in El Salvador was one
[15:12] of the the few assets the last two three
[15:15] years that actually outperformed
[15:17] Bitcoin uh which I heard I don't know
[15:21] I've never been to Sal I've never
[15:23] researched the topic but I heard it from
[15:25] like two three sources now uh and Luke I
[15:29] just because I made a podcast with him
[15:32] also he also mentioned that uh that he
[15:35] uh saw Salvador really rising in real
[15:39] estate value he expects similar things
[15:41] happening in Argentina and stuff like
[15:44] that but I'm not like I'm Bitcoin I
[15:46] don't want to get involved with real
[15:48] estate investment I think real estate
[15:50] investment is a very very risky thing at
[15:52] the moment uh no matter where you are
[15:55] also in Salvador I think it's better to
[15:57] have Bitcoin and just r
[15:59] for my for my personal view yeah yeah I
[16:02] agree entirely yeah you also mentioned
[16:05] which is also really interesting that
[16:07] every price is going up and Al obviously
[16:10] in Austria it's no no different I think
[16:13] it's even worse than in France in
[16:15] Austria um how is this in El salador
[16:18] right now because uh probably most of
[16:21] the things are still written in dollars
[16:24] as a unit of account but some probably
[16:26] in in Satoshi or in Bitcoin uh do you
[16:30] have this uh in this feeling or did you
[16:32] have this experience in some restaurant
[16:35] where the satosi are getting less every
[16:38] week you have to pay this you have to
[16:40] pay less Sates for every for a rep or
[16:42] something like that you had some some
[16:44] experience like that well well yeah your
[16:47] your purchasing power goes up over time
[16:50] with Bitcoin so especially in the last
[16:52] months um of course life gets cheaper
[16:56] even more so when when you're living on
[16:57] a Bitcoin standard uh which is what I'm
[17:00] doing I'm I work for me Premier Bitcoin
[17:02] now and um I'm getting paid in in
[17:05] Bitcoin so when Bitcoin goes up uh
[17:09] purchasing power goes up as well Ah
[17:13] that's amazing yeah I did not manage to
[17:15] get uh paid in in Bitcoin entirely uh
[17:20] but uh I'm working on it nice nice it's
[17:24] hard in Austria yeah I I understand and
[17:28] yeah for you um maybe interesting did
[17:30] you get in Bitcoin before you get in got
[17:33] in Salvador just or did you get bit okay
[17:37] yeah yeah yeah so I I I got into Bitcoin
[17:40] and cryptocurrency and whatever uh in
[17:44] 2017 actually I got into Bitcoin like
[17:48] Bitcoin only in 2016 I was trying to to
[17:51] buy weed online and I don't know what
[17:54] happened in the process I opened the
[17:56] electron wallet and I and I froze and I
[17:59] just couldn't understand what was
[18:01] happening and in the end I got scammed
[18:03] it was 50 but whatever and so that was
[18:06] my first experience with Bitcoin and
[18:08] then I heard about it again in 2017 and
[18:12] this is when I started doubling in
[18:14] shitcoins and whatever losing a ton
[18:17] of money and then started learning about
[18:20] Bitcoin and money and why we need uh
[18:24] Bitcoin to to to thrive as a
[18:27] civilization did your view on bitcoin
[18:30] change when you were in El
[18:34] Salvador yeah uh a little
[18:37] bit so before that I was completely
[18:40] Anonymous I didn't go to meetups I was
[18:44] very high on on privacy and that was a
[18:47] priority for me and after going to El
[18:50] Salvador and and starting this project
[18:52] on the island and even before that I I I
[18:55] created a website to do coaching and
[18:57] everything and I decided to to go public
[19:00] let's say and create like a public
[19:01] Twitter account
[19:03] and and so before that I saw Bitcoin as
[19:09] something that was really good for the
[19:12] future but I couldn't see like I I I
[19:15] didn't have the use of it like the the
[19:17] daily use of it and so then I arrived in
[19:21] Salvador and this is when I started
[19:22] paying for things in Bitcoin and you get
[19:24] addicted to that like it's it's it's a
[19:26] really nice feeling uh so so this is
[19:30] when I I shifted a little bit from this
[19:35] uh like future oriented uh Bitcoin as
[19:40] savings that that needs to be private
[19:43] and and because you don't want you you
[19:45] don't want them to be seized and
[19:46] everything to something that is more
[19:49] like uh like still the same thing but
[19:52] also like you can spend it and it's fine
[19:55] um so yeah Ah that's amazing I think I I
[19:59] interview a lot of different people like
[20:00] I have people on from India I have
[20:02] people on from Australia obviously from
[20:04] Austria and Germany also from America a
[20:07] lot of from from El Salvador I think I
[20:10] actually had more from El Salvador than
[20:12] from auston which is crazy to think
[20:14] about uh and I see so many different
[20:18] views on bitcoin for example when I
[20:21] asked the the question what's the main
[20:24] hurdle in their country about Bitcoin
[20:28] and in El Salvador I got the answer a
[20:30] lot uh that people think that Bitcoin is
[20:33] from the
[20:34] government right that's true you will
[20:36] never hear that in Austria here it's
[20:38] something completely against the
[20:40] government yeah so there is different
[20:43] views on on uh on what Bitcoin is is
[20:46] actually doing do you think it's uh
[20:49] because in El Salvador Bitcoin is is is
[20:51] spent and this Bitcoin is like in the
[20:53] circular economy do you think it's
[20:55] important for Bitcoin to be spent to for
[20:58] the for circular economy to to really go
[21:02] and uh for the thriving adoption yeah I
[21:07] mean obviously like if if we hadn't
[21:11] spent Bitcoin ever uh the coins would
[21:14] have stayed with the miners right so
[21:19] that wouldn't have worked so of course
[21:21] we need to to spend them to exchange
[21:23] them uh what you want is like it's just
[21:27] money you want to earn it more than you
[21:29] spend it right uh and for some people
[21:32] Bitcoin can be only an investment or
[21:34] only like uh pure savings and just
[21:37] stacking Bitcoin and never selling and
[21:39] you see the memes on Twitter and and
[21:41] that's great uh if you're living in a in
[21:44] a western country or or if you don't
[21:47] need it in your daily life
[21:50] right but then if you want to use it as
[21:52] a as your daily currency as your daily
[21:56] money uh that changes you have have to
[21:58] spend it and this is when it makes sense
[22:01] to to get on a Bitcoin standard and and
[22:04] earn in Bitcoin as well and I think
[22:06] that's when
[22:08] you're approaching Freedom right and
[22:11] self sovereignty that that's when you
[22:14] can say that you don't need Fiat anymore
[22:17] which
[22:18] is slightly not true for me because I
[22:21] still need to spend some Fiat uh at
[22:24] times um but then again it's just like a
[22:27] spectrum and it's a Direction right so
[22:29] the goal is to um well get away from the
[22:33] the old system the Legacy system and go
[22:36] towards the new
[22:37] one that's uh that's very true and
[22:39] you're doing also work with my first
[22:41] Bitcoin and with did you do you also do
[22:44] work with Bitcoin Beach are you also
[22:46] involved in that so the the first
[22:49] project on the island laa was a um
[22:54] project that was a collaboration between
[22:56] me Premier Bitcoin and Bitcoin Beach so
[22:59] Bitcoin Beach was uh funding the project
[23:02] and me premere Bitcoin was was in charge
[23:04] of the operations so they sent me on the
[23:06] island and I used the budget to uh well
[23:12] fund social projects and uh we did an
[23:15] event uh we renovated a communal house
[23:19] gave workshops there we gave uh Bitcoin
[23:23] classes English classes Spanish classes
[23:27] uh Bitcoin Workshop workshops for
[23:30] entrepreneurs um workshops for people
[23:32] that want to learn new skills to become
[23:36] entrepreneurs and and uh sell their
[23:38] skills to the tourists and after that we
[23:42] uh uh we organized uh Beach soccer
[23:45] tournament uh with the whole festival
[23:48] with music and everything I don't know
[23:49] how we pull this off it I had never done
[23:52] that before so it was it was really
[23:54] really funny and after that um we so we
[23:59] built a road uh an asphalt road like it
[24:03] was crazy and after that the the the
[24:06] last project was uh the creation of a of
[24:09] a seaw wall 50 MERS uh seaw wall because
[24:14] the seawater comes in When the tide is
[24:18] really really high in July August
[24:21] something like this uh it it goes above
[24:25] the it's a dirt seaw wall that they have
[24:29] and so we we created a new a new seaall
[24:32] out of like from
[24:34] scratch and uh so this is that that was
[24:37] laay and after that uh me Premier
[24:40] Bitcoin offered me to continue with um
[24:43] me Premier Bitcoin so I I'm now in
[24:45] charge of the um international
[24:48] relations and so what we're doing
[24:50] exactly is uh we we give classes in El
[24:53] Salvador right we we give uh Bitcoin
[24:56] classes to um Salvadorian students
[25:00] but then we also have like open source
[25:03] materials to to teach them and these
[25:06] materials uh were shared uh to the whole
[25:10] world and the the Bitcoin communities
[25:13] all around the
[25:14] globe and so uh after a while they came
[25:18] back to us gave us feedback and we
[25:20] started communicating right um
[25:22] exchanging best practices and
[25:25] tips and so we thought we we should do a
[25:29] community of communities we should build
[25:31] a network of Bitcoin communities uh that
[25:33] teach uh the Bitcoin diploma and and
[25:35] that provide this independent impartial
[25:39] open source education uh to their
[25:42] peers and this is where I came in they
[25:45] asked me to to be in charge of the
[25:47] international expansion and uh building
[25:50] this node Network where the Bitcoin
[25:52] communities all around the world are the
[25:54] nodes in the network and so we we strive
[25:57] to make it
[25:58] uh as decentralized as possible as
[26:02] self-governing as possible and uh this
[26:04] is what we're constantly working on to
[26:07] to of course it's not going to be
[26:09] decentralized as Bitcoin because um the
[26:12] Bitcoin nodes are computers that run uh
[26:16] objective replicable uh computer code so
[26:20] it's it's easy to verify it's easy to be
[26:23] I mean it's easier to be in consensus
[26:25] with the right software the the Bitcoin
[26:27] software right
[26:28] uh in the case of humans and and
[26:30] communities and and uh human
[26:33] organization it's slightly different so
[26:35] we need to to architect the network in a
[26:39] way that it's uh
[26:41] self-governing uh which is a great
[26:43] challenge it's it's very interesting and
[26:44] so all these
[26:46] communities get together every month and
[26:48] we we have this General Assembly where
[26:52] uh each Community presents uh what
[26:55] they've been working on uh their
[26:57] achievements what they need help with
[26:59] and this is fantastic to see you you
[27:02] should see the the level of of uh of of
[27:05] the interaction it's it's pure signal
[27:08] and uh the co the cooperation the the
[27:11] collaboration between uh these people
[27:13] these communities that uh all aligned on
[27:16] the same values and that focus on
[27:19] teaching their peers about Bitcoin is
[27:22] just fantastic to see amazing what what
[27:25] do you have some learning from the
[27:27] inaction of the in communities like
[27:29] something that came up from some other
[27:31] community that the communities then
[27:33] adopted how does the the open source uh
[27:37] program like look like the the learning
[27:40] material so yeah we we have our GitHub
[27:43] with uh the Bitcoin diploma our
[27:45] resources uh the transl the translations
[27:49] uh repositories and then we have the
[27:50] node Network
[27:52] repository with uh a directory for the
[27:55] node Network and so each uh bit uh
[27:59] Bitcoin community that is part of the
[28:00] node Network and create their own entry
[28:03] where they present their team uh who
[28:05] they are what they focus on uh
[28:08] achievements uh like all these
[28:11] informations that can be very
[28:13] interesting to people and also to well
[28:16] funding sources right and so in these
[28:20] directories they also have the
[28:21] possibility to upload their own contents
[28:25] and so what we saw is that uh we have
[28:28] certain notes that created slides for uh
[28:31] online classes for the Bitcoin diploma
[28:33] workbook um others have created
[28:36] activities and so they upload that and
[28:39] not only the node Network can benefit
[28:41] from it but the whole world can benefit
[28:43] from it because it's open source and so
[28:46] it's like this
[28:48] self-reinforcing mechanism where the
[28:51] node Network grows because each
[28:54] community grows because no network grows
[28:57] and it's it's beautiful to see it's only
[29:00] starting to to get traction uh but the
[29:03] growth that we're going to see in the
[29:05] future is going to be tremendous and I
[29:08] think we're going to speed up the
[29:09] timeline of Bitcoin adoption thanks to
[29:11] that 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day
[29:14] one and they teach and preach self
[29:17] custody this is my goto exchange when
[29:20] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[29:22] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[29:25] for bitcoiners and if you want low fees
[29:28] Plus at the same time support this
[29:31] podcast use code Robin and click the
[29:33] link in the description that's amazing I
[29:36] love when people come together and try
[29:38] to figure out how we can drive Bitcoin
[29:41] adoption a little bit further ahead uh
[29:45] this is amazing the we have an ENT in
[29:48] the podcast where the and the previous
[29:50] guest is asking a question for the next
[29:52] guest and this question get gets a
[29:54] little bit in that in that direction but
[29:57] I don't want to
[29:58] uh get the question now in in front so
[30:02] we will keep it for the end of the
[30:04] podcast um for people now that like for
[30:08] example for me I cannot really spend my
[30:11] Bitcoin like in Austria there are not a
[30:14] lot of places that accept Bitcoin and
[30:17] even when they accept it I have to pay
[30:19] capital gains tax on on the spend
[30:21] Bitcoin it's whole whole hurdle so I'm
[30:24] just like having my feat stack and spend
[30:28] my feat and everything that I don't need
[30:30] operational I have in Bitcoin so I use
[30:32] Bitcoin as my store of value basically
[30:34] and then I'm kind of all in in Bitcoin
[30:37] just a small operational money I have in
[30:41] in in in yeah feeld what's your like
[30:45] Bitcoin setup look like you also
[30:47] mentioned that you have a little bit
[30:48] fear left uh um and you spend it I think
[30:52] you spend more Bitcoin on a regular
[30:56] maybe even daily basis you probably also
[30:58] receive money in Bitcoin so how how is
[31:03] your setup do you have lightning uh do
[31:06] you which apps do you use I think for
[31:09] people especially not from El Salvador
[31:10] not from places where they can spend
[31:12] Bitcoin they're really curious uh how
[31:15] Bitcoin on an individual level the the
[31:17] setup can look like do you probably have
[31:20] like some savings account where it's
[31:23] good secured and then also pay wallet or
[31:25] something like that yeah so so that's a
[31:28] great question so first of all I think
[31:30] that your setup is is great I mean if
[31:31] you if you can spend Bitcoin uh you just
[31:35] stack it and that's fine and maybe at
[31:37] some point uh you'll want or you'll have
[31:40] to leave your country and and uh maybe
[31:43] Bitcoin at this point will become
[31:45] something that is going to be very
[31:47] necessary and I don't know if you see
[31:48] this book The sovereign individual have
[31:50] you read it uh yes yes yes it's a great
[31:52] book so so they're basically talking
[31:55] about Bitcoin right like the the in the
[31:58] book uh there is this electronic uh cash
[32:01] money um that will allow uh Sovereign
[32:06] individuals to become completely free of
[32:10] political um control and and that will
[32:13] be able to who'll be able to um go
[32:16] travel the world and just go where
[32:18] they're treated best so maybe at some
[32:20] point that's going to be your case as
[32:22] well but yeah in terms of my setup I
[32:25] detailed that on my Twitter account um
[32:28] and this is something I'm constantly
[32:30] working on and I I've I've um I've gone
[32:34] back to to rethinking about it in the in
[32:37] the last uh months let's say uh but yeah
[32:40] I use I mostly use so if you want the
[32:43] whole detail uh because I'm I'm not
[32:45] really shy about that anymore um
[32:49] so for now at me Prem Bitcoin we are
[32:53] paid with uh lightning
[32:55] URLs and so I mostly use Phoenix for my
[32:57] day today but they don't have the L URLs
[33:00] or maybe I just haven't found them uh
[33:03] which is possible uh so I use um wallet
[33:07] of Satoshi for that and then I transfer
[33:11] everything to Phoenix and uh
[33:16] what's above a a certain threshold in
[33:19] Phoenix I just transfer it to a cold
[33:21] storage and so uh I have the so I use a
[33:26] foundation passport for more uh single
[33:29] Sig cold storage and right now I just
[33:33] implemented uh a family Vault that's
[33:36] what I call U multi-c distributed
[33:40] multisig among uh not airs but Guardians
[33:45] and airs and uh this is something I've
[33:48] been working on in the past months and
[33:51] so uh it's a
[33:53] 305 with a pass phrase on top of each uh
[33:57] seed it's the same pass race and so the
[34:00] Guardians have the seeds but they can't
[34:02] collude between themselves um and if
[34:05] they get robbed uh it's not such a big
[34:09] deal because uh there's no they don't
[34:13] have the pass Ras and The Heirs have the
[34:17] pass Rays have each a copy of the pass
[34:19] rays and so they have this active part
[34:23] that they can take with them uh wherever
[34:26] they live or they go travel or
[34:29] whatever and uh the Guardians are uh
[34:33] individuals that have more stable
[34:36] locations right like a house that they
[34:38] own or something like this and they have
[34:41] more of a passive
[34:44] um role in the setup and after that
[34:48] comes well instructions recovery
[34:50] instructions for the for the heirs for
[34:53] the Guardians uh and I've been working
[34:56] on this for the past last month or so
[35:00] and this is something I'm very proud of
[35:02] because I had never done that before in
[35:04] such uh a level of
[35:07] detail and right now I'm building an
[35:10] online course uh so that people can
[35:12] replicate exactly that uh with their own
[35:17] uh specific situation right uh who's my
[35:21] heirs uh who's my who are my Guardians
[35:25] um questions like this and and it's
[35:28] going to be a lot of work I'm only
[35:29] getting started uh but I think that's
[35:31] something that's going to be very very
[35:33] helpful for a lot of people especially
[35:36] for people that
[35:37] travel and uh that want to make sure
[35:40] that they don't have like they don't
[35:42] have to travel with their money uh but
[35:46] at the same time they don't have to
[35:47] leave their money at home uh and guard
[35:49] it right um so I think that's going to
[35:52] be very very interesting for uh people
[35:54] that aspire to become uh Sovereign
[35:56] individuals
[35:58] amazing I think uh you said you're just
[36:01] now getting started with maybe we can
[36:03] like once you have like a nice setup and
[36:05] you have like everything laid out maybe
[36:08] we can have you back on in like two
[36:09] three four months and then you can
[36:11] really walk us through the whole process
[36:14] and and how people can adopt it like
[36:16] basically a a Bitcoin setup for uh uh
[36:20] nomades that the they want to like move
[36:23] around a lot travel a lot because if you
[36:25] if you have just a home base um then you
[36:28] don't have a lot of the challenges that
[36:30] you have as when you travel a lot
[36:32] because yeah if you don't want to be in
[36:33] a in a in a plane and have all your
[36:36] Bitcoin with
[36:37] you yeah that's that's not a great
[36:40] feeling yeah so so the setup I actually
[36:43] have I I I could detail it if you'd like
[36:46] uh what I don't have yet is the well the
[36:49] whole online course with videos and uh
[36:52] PDFs and you know everything that uh is
[36:56] required to make it a simple process to
[36:59] follow for well less technical
[37:02] individuals I mean even for me and I'm
[37:03] not that technical but I'm kind of a
[37:05] Bitcoin nerd which is not the case for
[37:08] many people uh even bitcoiners right
[37:11] some of us like Bitcoin but they don't
[37:14] have they don't like the the technical
[37:17] stuff yeah and so yeah I don't have the
[37:19] material uh for them yet but I I could
[37:23] technically walk you through the process
[37:26] it's it's pretty simple like
[37:28] a really really cool yeah then I will
[37:30] just uh once you have it available just
[37:32] link to your sites uh because this video
[37:35] also needs a little time till it gets
[37:38] out maybe it's even like in the same
[37:39] time and then people can can check it
[37:42] out in the in the links down below and
[37:44] can check out your sites and what you
[37:45] doing directly uh this will be perfect
[37:48] there um let's let's change topics a
[37:51] little bit um I often think about the
[37:54] question um because we there's a say
[37:57] first they ignore you then they laugh at
[37:59] you uh then they fight you and then they
[38:02] join you and I always think of like
[38:05] which which phase are we in because they
[38:07] definitely don't ignore us because
[38:09] everybody is talking about
[38:11] Bitcoin uh I think we are above that de
[38:15] laugh at us because we now having a
[38:18] Bitcoin ETF in America we have legal
[38:20] tender stators we have a lot of publicly
[38:23] traded companies in Bitcoin we have uh
[38:26] really grass movement around the world
[38:29] uh we have so many things going for
[38:31] Bitcoin so I don't think we can say we
[38:35] in the lovers State um I'm confused
[38:39] between uh the the the fighters between
[38:42] and the the join us and uh the question
[38:46] I really wanted to ask you now
[38:48] is how do we know when we won like when
[38:54] when do we consider uh a win for sound
[38:58] money what has to happen for Bitcoin for
[39:00] sound money for our financial system
[39:03] that we are saying yes sound money hard
[39:06] money has now actually won and we are
[39:08] not in this Kian economics BS anymore
[39:13] right that's a great question um so in
[39:17] my opinion we are only starting to go
[39:21] from they laugh at you to then they
[39:24] fight you I think the ETF
[39:29] is I could even go so far as to say it's
[39:33] still part of the of the they laugh at
[39:35] you because they're like yeah I mean
[39:39] it's it's a speculate speculative asset
[39:42] and they're going to speculate on it
[39:44] like they yeah it's kind of a well okay
[39:49] we realize like one property of Bitcoin
[39:52] because people I mean people want the
[39:54] product we create the product for them
[39:56] and we make money off of it which is
[39:59] okay I mean it's a free market I guess
[40:02] um but then uh when you see what's
[40:05] happening in Europe for example with un
[40:07] hosted wallets and that they're going to
[40:09] make it illegal or I don't follow the
[40:12] news that much but um I've seen that uh
[40:16] there's there are things happening
[40:19] around that right and uh I think this is
[40:22] when uh the thing they fight you phase
[40:26] begins uh because maybe that's the
[40:29] pessimistic uh side of me that that that
[40:32] is talking
[40:34] but we are
[40:36] taking the only
[40:40] uh way the only um mechanism governments
[40:46] uh have to
[40:49] survive and we're taking it we're taking
[40:52] it away from
[40:53] them and we're saying we're not
[40:56] supporting you anymore you're going to
[40:59] not probably die but you're going to
[41:02] shrink a lot and we're going to do our
[41:05] own thing without
[41:06] you uh that's basically what we're
[41:09] saying with Bitcoin right uh it's money
[41:12] that is uh independent from the
[41:15] government and so if they don't have
[41:18] that anymore if people do not use their
[41:21] currencies their Fiat currencies uh by
[41:24] decree uh that were imposed on us if we
[41:27] don't use them
[41:29] anymore uh they won't be happy and I
[41:33] believe they haven't even started yet uh
[41:36] to fight us like they're
[41:38] still laughing at us it's like they're
[41:42] only realizing they're only starting to
[41:44] realize that um we might be onto
[41:47] something and this is why they're going
[41:50] to try and maybe not ban Bitcoin uh
[41:53] outright but they're going to try and
[41:55] capture it like and host it wallets what
[41:57] isn't an hosted wallet doesn't mean
[41:59] anything and they don't know anything
[42:01] about Bitcoin the only thing that they
[42:03] know is that they want to capture it and
[42:05] so they're going to try every possible
[42:08] way to capture it and at some point
[42:10] maybe they're going to even try and
[42:12] scare people by doing like Mass arrests
[42:17] or whatever like they can do 6102 kyc
[42:21] reach out to some people and say you
[42:23] have Undeclared Bitcoin uh under your
[42:27] floorboards right so that can happen and
[42:32] I think that in many countries that will
[42:34] happen and so again this is why I went
[42:38] like as far as to leave my country and
[42:41] and go 10,000 kilometers away uh live
[42:44] live in a country that is uh Pro
[42:47] Bitcoin so yeah and to answer the the
[42:51] latter part of the question uh when when
[42:55] do we know we won I think that's
[42:58] something we're going to be able to say
[43:00] uh maybe a 100 years for from now when
[43:04] when we're really sure that we won or
[43:07] maybe even more than that we don't know
[43:09] I mean I don't know the future and uh
[43:12] who knows what can happen maybe Bitcoin
[43:15] is a trojan horse and uh they fight us
[43:19] for a little while and then they realize
[43:22] it's not worth it and so they join us
[43:24] and everything's great or uh they fight
[43:27] us for a hundred years and it's going to
[43:30] be
[43:32] terrible and then after the fire stops
[43:36] uh the Phoenix Rises From the Ashes who
[43:39] knows uh there are a lot of possible
[43:41] scenarios and I I don't really know what
[43:44] will happen so I'm just focusing on
[43:48] living life and uh making sure that
[43:50] today in the present I can help people
[43:53] uh get on to bitcoin all that's an
[43:56] amazing thing like because um I also
[43:59] want to because actually of this reason
[44:01] want to document the whole thing on my
[44:03] podcast have so many have as many
[44:07] possible guests on my show as humanly I
[44:10] can
[44:12] do I am doing 300 this year probably
[44:15] even like 320 330 something around that
[44:20] uh and this will be extremely uh cool to
[44:23] see in like 10 20 years when you look
[44:26] back at those prod episodes and see what
[44:29] people thought about the future and how
[44:30] it actually turned out uh and this is
[44:33] brings me also my to my next question
[44:35] what do you think when we come to the
[44:37] stage where we have one and when we are
[44:40] over the hill where we are on this sound
[44:43] money uh level maybe in 50 years maybe
[44:46] in five years maybe in 150 years when
[44:49] whenever it is um what would it like how
[44:52] different is this world looking like and
[44:55] uh what what can you already see in El
[44:59] Salvador uh in as a small window to this
[45:03] world in 150
[45:05] years so that's that's a great question
[45:08] I I think one can only imagine and and
[45:12] visualize what may happen right and we
[45:15] could talk about lower time preference
[45:18] we could talk about um distribution of
[45:22] of capital and and
[45:24] like the opposite of misallocation and
[45:27] we could see we could talk about more
[45:29] freedom more individual Freedom more
[45:31] self- sovereignty and everything
[45:34] but as a big picture I have absolutely
[45:38] no idea uh maybe maybe the world is
[45:40] going to fracture before that and so
[45:42] we're going to see like Oasis of of uh
[45:46] of self- sovereignty among a world full
[45:49] of tyranny who knows who knows
[45:54] um but yeah we're gonna we're going to
[45:56] see some big changes and I I I I think
[45:59] we're already seeing that like when you
[46:02] go to Western countries um it's it's
[46:07] terrible like you see the beautiful
[46:09] architecture you see all this this
[46:12] Legacy of the past and then you see
[46:14] what's happening today and it's like
[46:17] that's not that's not pretty right
[46:20] um and so that only tells you where it's
[46:23] going for now and then you go to other
[46:26] places like Sal and it's like yeah we
[46:30] come from a pretty bad place like a few
[46:33] years ago people were dying in the
[46:35] street and
[46:37] and that was terrible and before that it
[46:40] was a Civil War and and I mean the re
[46:44] the the recent history of el Sal is is
[46:46] terrible but now you see that people
[46:49] start earning more money and they see
[46:53] that infrastructure is getting better
[46:55] and so they want to work towards uh
[46:58] improving their lives and this is a much
[47:01] better feeling and much better
[47:03] atmosphere to live
[47:05] in that's am yeah I think it's um when
[47:09] when we look at the the future what
[47:11] money can do and it's so fundamental
[47:14] because uh people say yeah it's just
[47:16] money people have have to still like do
[47:19] all the stuff and this is right like I
[47:21] always make this comparison between uh
[47:23] you're running in the sand with with a
[47:25] lot of water and it's yeah it's
[47:27] beautiful to run in the sand of course
[47:30] but when you're just focusing on the
[47:31] Running part when you run on the sand
[47:33] with like maybe kneat deep uh water you
[47:36] you can barely run like you fall down
[47:39] you you have a really hard time running
[47:42] and when you compare that to a solid
[47:43] Street where you can run nicely um in
[47:47] both cases you still have to run
[47:48] yourself because Bitcoin is still just
[47:50] money uh but once you get running you
[47:54] get a lot more for your energy that put
[47:57] you put in on a Bitcoin standard then on
[48:00] a Fiat standard so I think this is like
[48:03] kind of the thing that we can just
[48:05] imagine what could happen like what will
[48:09] happen on a society level when nobody is
[48:13] being taken advantage of by a central
[48:17] Authority what can happen when everybody
[48:19] can accumulate money when nobody has any
[48:21] limits to it and there is no uh water
[48:25] head above us that takes everything in
[48:28] and tries to like say you do this you do
[48:31] this you do this like it's it's um it's
[48:34] a massive change in the future I guess
[48:37] and it will be really interesting to see
[48:40] how this all faces out but yeah nobody
[48:43] knows how this will turn out that's why
[48:45] I'm asking it so often uh because when
[48:47] we have a lot of different opinions on
[48:49] on the same matter we might get a view
[48:52] on what might happen directionally not
[48:55] exactly just directionally
[48:57] yeah um yeah there is a there is a great
[49:01] video um uh conference uh that was given
[49:06] by uh yor Kido Elman the Austrian
[49:11] Economist uh that that took place I
[49:15] don't remember the the year but it was
[49:17] some years ago and it's it's predicting
[49:21] what's going to what's happening today
[49:23] and it was called the the the the the
[49:26] cultural consequences of Fiat
[49:29] money and it's mind-blowing like you can
[49:33] like he talks about everything that's
[49:35] happening and if you pair that with the
[49:38] the book when money dies from uh Adam
[49:42] fergusen uh it's just it just combines
[49:45] perfectly like you you see the direction
[49:48] things are taking um in in the short
[49:52] term let's say
[49:54] [Music]
[49:55] and that at least for me that helps me
[49:59] imagine uh where we can go from there
[50:02] once we touch the bottom right it's we
[50:05] can only go up and we can only grow
[50:09] again that's uh it's very true I I like
[50:12] what you're what you're saying and uh I
[50:15] think bitcoiners are really curious
[50:17] people all the time and that's why I'm
[50:19] before the end of the podcast I like to
[50:21] ask what are you currently uh learning
[50:24] about like what's your what's your
[50:26] passion right now uh what you're looking
[50:28] into it doesn't have to be about Bitcoin
[50:30] if it's about Bitcoin it's okay but if
[50:32] it's not about Bitcoin like what are you
[50:35] currently uh spending the most of their
[50:38] time learning
[50:39] about so right now well about Bitcoin
[50:43] it's mostly uh multisig uh along with
[50:47] covenants and stuff like that that I
[50:50] have a hard time like understanding um
[50:54] but other than Bitcoin uh in the last
[50:56] last month I did some carpentry so I
[50:59] built the the shelves that you can see
[51:02] behind me I I built some furniture for
[51:05] my new
[51:06] house I'm renting right but that's my
[51:09] new home and it was empty so I had to to
[51:11] build some stuff uh because I didn't
[51:13] want to to buy the cheap uh shitty
[51:16] furniture from the store so I I just uh
[51:19] made my own um and yeah that that was
[51:24] mostly it for the the past months and
[51:27] right now I'm I'm building this website
[51:30] I have to learn um a whole lot of things
[51:34] about uh you know online marketing and
[51:37] uh email and all these things that I'm
[51:40] not that good at uh because I just want
[51:43] to to provide value to people and you
[51:46] have to ship that value to people and
[51:47] you have to find ways to connect with
[51:50] people so I need to to learn more about
[51:52] that yeah that's uh that's uh I mean
[51:56] this also what I'm learning with the
[51:57] podcast I'm trying to figure out okay
[52:00] how can I package my videos so good that
[52:03] it that it's even reaching non-
[52:05] bitcoiners because bitcoiners will find
[52:08] my videos eventually I I have enough
[52:10] bitcoiners on and I have uh really
[52:12] interesting videos uh bitcoiners will
[52:15] talk to each other and say hey check out
[52:17] Robin he has really good interviews but
[52:19] I think I really want to have such great
[52:23] good titles thumbnails everything the
[52:25] packaging has to be so great that it
[52:27] reaches the nocoiner level because if
[52:30] I'm just an equo chamber for for for
[52:34] bitcoiners it's still great because it's
[52:36] something that when some new bitcoiners
[52:38] are coming in they can check out my
[52:39] Bitcoin and podcasting can go in but I
[52:42] want to package it so good that no
[52:45] coiners are like oh what's going on
[52:47] there with Bitcoin and then Salvador
[52:49] what's like what's that so that's kind
[52:51] of my why I'm so bullish on uh how to
[52:55] Market and how to package stuff because
[52:58] it's important that we bitcoiners um
[53:00] marketing and packaging stuff really
[53:02] good because sound money is important
[53:05] and the more we can get into that sphere
[53:08] the smoother the transition to bitcoin
[53:11] to some money will be it the transition
[53:13] will come anyways the question is will
[53:15] it be smooth or will it be really hard
[53:18] and will it be painful I hope for a
[53:20] smooth transa move transition and that's
[53:23] why we have to educate people um for the
[53:26] Android
[53:27] uh as I teased before we have an end
[53:29] routine where the previous guest is
[53:31] asking a question for next guest and
[53:33] it's a big question uh but maybe an
[53:35] interesting one because you are actually
[53:37] working in that uh field uh how do we
[53:40] get the world to adopt Bitcoin uh that's
[53:43] that's a great question um so I believe
[53:46] and we believe at me Premier Bitcoin
[53:48] that uh open source Bitcoin education is
[53:52] the answer open source Bitcoin education
[53:54] that is independent impartial and
[53:57] delivered in a decentralized Grassroots
[54:01] Unstoppable way and this is what we're
[54:03] building right where're we're teaching
[54:06] in El Salvador but we're also building
[54:08] this uh Unstoppable Library like living
[54:13] Library um that just ships all around
[54:16] the globe at all times and that learns
[54:20] from itself and uh to us that's the
[54:24] answer education education
[54:27] education really really cool thank you
[54:29] quenon for being on thank you for
[54:30] speaking uh to us today uh it was a
[54:33] pleasure having you it was a pleasure
[54:35] hearing what you were thinking of
[54:37] Salvador Bitcoin and the the world how
[54:39] it uh collapses or evolves in front of
[54:42] us however you want to see it um when
[54:45] people want to ask you questions and and
[54:48] get in touch with you what's the best
[54:50] way to get in touch with you so I have a
[54:53] Twitter account uh it's Quentin btcb I
[54:58] have I have to check it I don't uh fully

[55:02] I'm working on the website but again I
[55:04] had made a beautiful website but nobody
[55:07] came to the website so I just uh tore it
[55:10] down and I'm building a new one um so
[55:13] it's in it's under construction and uh
