[00:00] Bitcoin is money and Noster it's the
[00:02] same idea instead of transferring money
[00:04] what we transfer is information Noster
[00:06] makes us self- Sovereign in what we say
[00:09] on the internet and this is something
[00:11] that no other social media can ever be
[00:13] able to do you're capable of saying
[00:15] whatever you want and your audience can
[00:17] verify that that's what you said nobody
[00:19] can fake it you can build your own
[00:20] algorithm if I don't like cooking
[00:21] recipes I can say don't show me this
[00:23] it's my choice we're very early we are
[00:25] just 4 years old and this is like
[00:27] Bitcoin 10 years ago
[00:30] [Music]
[00:33] you are focusing on Nostra as I as I
[00:38] understood it um maybe because I know
[00:41] most of the people that listen to this
[00:43] podcast know Bitcoin at least they heard
[00:45] about it uh but I saw uh when I ask
[00:50] people about Nostra that there are some
[00:52] people that actually have no clue about
[00:54] Nostra especially on YouTube um it's not
[00:57] that common there um give us an you what
[01:00] is Nostra what does Nostra what what
[01:03] makes Nostra special uh and yeah what
[01:06] what is Nostra in general right so I
[01:09] have I think I have the perfect analogy
[01:11] for your audience for the bitcoiners so
[01:15] let's start with first the name right
[01:16] like what is Noster Noster is an acronym
[01:19] that stands for notes and other stuff
[01:24] transmitted by relays okay what does it
[01:28] mean doesn't matter that's the name
[01:30] right so let's start with this
[01:33] uh this um idea that I that I thought
[01:36] about how to explain Noster so imagine
[01:40] Bitcoin everybody knows from from from
[01:43] your audience what is bitcoin Bitcoin is
[01:45] a protocol and you can have Bitcoin I
[01:47] can have Bitcoin and if I want I can
[01:50] send you Bitcoin but it doesn't matter
[01:54] what app what wallet I am using it
[01:58] doesn't matter
[02:00] I can be using wet of Satoshi I can be
[02:03] using uh blink or I can be using uh uh
[02:08] something different than what you are
[02:10] using and it doesn't matter because the
[02:12] Bitcoin will arrive to you so the way
[02:15] I'm I'm explaining Noster it's the same
[02:18] so Noster is a protocol it's a base
[02:20] layer it's a set of algorithms of pro
[02:24] it's a programming programming tool that
[02:27] is used to connect one people with
[02:29] another
[02:30] Bitcoin what we are connecting or the
[02:33] the tool that that is used for is to
[02:36] transfer um money right Bitcoin is money
[02:41] and Noster it's like the same idea that
[02:45] but instead of trans transferring money
[02:47] what we transfer is information what
[02:49] kind of information it can be a video it
[02:52] can be a text it can be a long text it
[02:55] can be a podcast that's why it's called
[02:58] notes and other stuff note a note could
[03:01] be just two words like good morning
[03:04] Robin that could be a note and then the
[03:06] other stuff can be a video like part of
[03:09] this recording that we are having at the
[03:11] moment and it's transmitted by relays
[03:15] what are the relays relay is just
[03:17] imagine a synonym for a node a Bitcoin
[03:20] node what is a Bitcoin node it's just a
[03:23] computer connected to to all the network
[03:26] of computers that are talking the same
[03:28] language so in Bitcoin they are called
[03:31] nodes and in Noster they are called
[03:34] relays what they are they're just
[03:36] computers that are talking the same
[03:39] protocol which is the Bas layer and why
[03:42] why was I using this comparison between
[03:45] Bitcoin and wallets and all this because
[03:48] Noster it's like a base layer and we can
[03:51] communicate we can send all these notes
[03:53] all these videos all these podcasts
[03:56] using different types of apps they are
[03:58] not called apps
[04:00] like in Bitcoin they are called wallets
[04:02] in Noster they are called clients it
[04:05] doesn't matter they are just synonyms to
[04:08] be able to to understand that it's just
[04:11] a protocol and then everybody can build
[04:13] on it it's interesting um would it
[04:16] actually be possible I never had that
[04:17] thought but would it actually be
[04:19] possible to build maybe a layer three on
[04:22] top of lightning and build directly on
[04:26] bitcoin kind of a social media thing
[04:28] because uh you can
[04:30] uh also sent notes with uh
[04:33] lightning
[04:35] probably probably videos and other stuff
[04:37] will be really
[04:38] hard I don't know how to how to do that
[04:42] uh but it's probably not possible to
[04:44] build directly natively uh the things
[04:46] that Nostra has on bitcoin on a
[04:50] obviously like it has to be far away
[04:52] from the main chain otherwise the costs
[04:54] are too high uh but that's probably not
[04:57] possible right so the problem with no
[05:00] for this use case is that they are like
[05:04] small machines the beauty of Bitcoin is
[05:07] that all of us all PLS can be part of
[05:09] the network and it is because um Bitcoin
[05:14] is just like a few
[05:16] megabytes but because it's just text
[05:18] it's like plain text that's why you can
[05:20] say as you were saying on Lightning not
[05:22] like um hello Robin this is a tip for
[05:24] you I like what you're doing something
[05:25] like that just a plain string of text
[05:29] but when you start talking
[05:32] about long strings of text videos audio
[05:37] this uses a lot of of space and the
[05:40] difference between Bitcoin and Noster
[05:42] because as I was saying I I was using
[05:45] the the example of Bitcoin as a
[05:47] comparison but Bitcoin has something
[05:49] that Noster doesn't have which is the
[05:52] blockchain the blockchain is copying
[05:55] everything that's going on on all these
[05:57] small computers on all these small notes
[05:59] but in Noster the computers cannot have
[06:03] a copy of everything because if you try
[06:05] to copy all the videos how many
[06:07] megabytes gigabytes terabytes petabytes
[06:10] of data do you
[06:11] need there is not enough space so people
[06:14] couldn't be running these decentralized
[06:17] network if they put have to copy
[06:19] everything so I know some people in
[06:22] Bitcoin is playing and experimenting
[06:25] with sending like all kinds of stuff
[06:28] that are not money but they are limited
[06:31] and when they when there is a lot of
[06:32] demand for that is as you were saying
[06:35] the the fees ramp up a lot and and then
[06:40] the main purpose of of what the the
[06:42] chain was built uh loses its its initial
[06:47] purpose so it could be it could be built
[06:50] but because of all these technical
[06:52] limitations that's why I think Noster is
[06:56] a better tool to to decentralize this
[06:59] kind of information which again Noster
[07:02] doesn't have any blockchain it's not
[07:04] copying everything that everybody's
[07:06] saying on all the those relays that are
[07:08] the computers that are on the
[07:10] network so there are those relays and on
[07:14] those relays the data is like the video
[07:16] the uh text on those relays but it is
[07:19] not on every relay the same data on on
[07:22] the different relays there are different
[07:25] um datas and you can access with the
[07:30] Noster protocol with connecting to all
[07:32] those relays to all the data is that is
[07:36] that correctly understood that's the way
[07:38] it is Imagine like nost what is Noster
[07:40] right so Noster is like this protocol
[07:44] that most of us are using it as a layer
[07:47] to build social networks so social
[07:50] networks today or I don't like to call
[07:52] them social networks all of them maybe
[07:54] more social media but that's another
[07:56] topic but the way they work is that they
[07:59] have their set of computers of servers
[08:03] that they run it's like these same
[08:05] relays maybe they don't have them on
[08:07] house maybe they pay Amazon web services
[08:10] or maybe they pay Google Cloud platform
[08:12] or Microsoft aour so what they have is
[08:15] that they have different computers
[08:17] distributed all around the globe to for
[08:21] us to to access but if I'm using um
[08:26] Instagram I will only be able to access
[08:29] those servers that are property or that
[08:32] are paid by Instagram that are uploading
[08:36] the information let's say the reals that
[08:37] I would like to see today so Noster is
[08:40] the same but instead of being owned by
[08:42] one
[08:43] Instagram or one or one single company
[08:48] it can be run by us you could run your
[08:50] own relay the same way I could run my
[08:52] own maybe I can I would like to to run
[08:55] my relay for my own family or for my own
[08:59] community
[09:00] and then everything that everybody posts
[09:02] I will be the guardian of this
[09:04] information if my computer breaks if my
[09:07] computer computer freezes if I get I
[09:10] don't know like a power outage or or
[09:12] that computer get disconnected and you
[09:15] will not be able to see what I posted
[09:17] that's why there are like some
[09:19] professional relay no noers that they do
[09:22] copies of it but they do it because they
[09:25] want not because the protocol itself is
[09:27] always copying everything
[09:29] if I'm now logged in for example in
[09:33] Primal um uh as as I use Primal um
[09:38] mostly um when I press send on which
[09:42] relay is it sent like do I did I did I
[09:46] first select what relay I want to put my
[09:49] data on like how does that work so when
[09:52] you download any client of Noster like
[09:55] Primal
[09:57] it it tries to make make it easier for
[10:00] you not asking you all these type of
[10:02] questions because most people might get
[10:05] like overwhelmed by all these technical
[10:08] kind of information that nobody ever
[10:10] told them they have to worry about like
[10:13] Instagram is doing all these on on the
[10:16] backstage they are selecting when you
[10:18] download the app which server will you
[10:20] connect first because it's closer maybe
[10:22] to your house or to your ISP
[10:25] provider but Primal for example he
[10:28] allows it allows you to to change the
[10:30] list of notes that you want to connect
[10:32] so when you download it it automatically
[10:35] chooses the ones that he thinks that are
[10:37] most relevant for you but then you can
[10:39] go to settings and and change it and if
[10:41] you have your own note you can say okay
[10:44] everything I post will be published here
[10:46] why because I want just just because you
[10:48] want you can do it is there um a danger
[10:53] of uh
[10:55] centralizing uh relays in the sense of
[10:59] like when we have those like right now
[11:02] nostril is still like very small but
[11:04] like let's imagine there's like one two
[11:07] maybe three clients that get really
[11:09] popular that have like default settings
[11:11] uh because they make it super easy and
[11:13] they all kind of like like those three
[11:15] are the the main relays uh so is is
[11:18] there a danger of long term if we scale
[11:20] this thing make it super easy user
[11:22] friendly that we kind of end up with the
[11:25] the the same system that we already have
[11:27] now where all the data is basically at
[11:29] like three different places yeah amazing
[11:32] topic of discussion and the first
[11:34] question is like is this something we
[11:37] have to worry about is this something
[11:39] bad is centralization bad for uploading
[11:42] this video for example because if it's
[11:45] run by amateurs then and you have a big
[11:48] audience maybe the S the server doesn't
[11:51] allow all your viewers to be able to
[11:54] enjoy like the same level of quality so
[11:57] there will always have to be some
[12:00] tiers some like
[12:03] um professional relay know the relay
[12:08] Runners that they have to offer
[12:09] something that that the users want and
[12:13] I'm asking like is this something we
[12:14] have to worry about because there are
[12:16] there is another thing that I think it's
[12:18] more important that we have to worry
[12:20] about which is not the centralization of
[12:22] the information because as I'm saying
[12:26] the when you download one of those apps
[12:28] the system automatically chooses for you
[12:30] but the more you learn then you can
[12:32] change them so but there is something
[12:35] that even if you don't Lo this app and
[12:37] you have always all the factory settings
[12:41] you will never be able to change and
[12:43] this is what people should worry more
[12:46] about which is the authenticity of what
[12:49] were you're saying so the the value the
[12:54] the differentiating point of Noster
[12:56] compared to other social networks like
[12:58] maybe Facebook Twitter Instagram or even
[13:01] blue sky that people is talking about
[13:03] like no this is more freedom for Freedom
[13:05] Seekers and so on no like all these
[13:07] companies that are run by um by a all
[13:11] these social media companies that are
[13:13] run by one company what they try to do
[13:16] is like
[13:17] to um to get you there so they can serve
[13:21] you content and then based on that
[13:23] content they can make some kind of of
[13:26] Revenue which is not bad that's not what
[13:28] I'm saying
[13:29] but what what I'm saying is that because
[13:31] they are centralized companies you can
[13:33] never know that what people is
[13:37] saying is that they are saying so if I
[13:40] follow you on Twitter and you know I
[13:43] like your content and every every time
[13:45] you you post something I I engage with
[13:49] you but you are not the owner of the
[13:51] content that you post on Twitter and
[13:54] everything you post there you expect
[13:57] Twitter to it the way you post it if you
[14:01] set a a comma you expect if you type a
[14:04] comma you expect Twitter to post a comma
[14:07] there but anybody in in Twitter can
[14:10] enter to your account any employee and
[14:13] post anything like I hate
[14:15] Bitcoin and then all your reputation is
[14:18] gone right right so this is what all
[14:21] these big social media companies have
[14:24] the power of it's which is the the
[14:28] speech that they saying it's under under
[14:30] their control and the different thing
[14:32] that Noster has is that everything you
[14:35] say and I'm going back to the to the
[14:38] comparison with Bitcoin everything you
[14:40] say if you post a coma if you post a a
[14:42] full stop if you post a I love Bitcoin
[14:45] text if you post a video everything you
[14:47] post needs to be signed by you and when
[14:50] I mean signed it's like when when you
[14:53] send a transaction on bitcoin even you
[14:56] don't you maybe you don't know when you
[14:58] click Send
[14:59] at this moment on the back uh the system
[15:04] is verifying that when you're sending
[15:07] you are signing this electronically so
[15:10] everything we post on Noster will be
[15:12] always always be signed by the owner of
[15:16] that
[15:17] Noster pair of public and private key so
[15:22] the the main differentiation from from
[15:25] these social media companies is that I
[15:29] if I if I see if I'm following you on no
[15:31] using Primal amethyst whichever client I
[15:34] don't I don't matter which client I'm
[15:37] using because I have your public key
[15:40] which is your we could call it username
[15:44] and you signed that message that said I
[15:46] love Bitcoin with your private key I can
[15:50] verify using a simple algorithm that you
[15:53] were the people who signed up so Noster
[15:57] makes us like sell Sovereign in what we
[16:00] say on the internet and this is
[16:03] something that no other social media can
[16:05] ever be able to do because if they do
[16:08] that they lose the the The Narrative of
[16:12] what they're of what they're trying to
[16:14] to push so this is more to me this is
[16:16] more important than if if the relays are
[16:20] more centralized or not centralized
[16:22] because even if a Rel is centralized
[16:24] they cannot fake what you are posting so
[16:27] it's it's impossible inside of
[16:30] nothing can the
[16:32] relays um if if for example I just edit
[16:37] if I
[16:38] only can can a relay edit the content uh
[16:43] once you sign it like you you post it to
[16:45] a relay you sign it and only you can
[16:47] sign it but once the data is at the
[16:49] Relay can they go ahead and and edit
[16:52] that yeah good good question so
[16:55] everything so imagine like let's make it
[16:57] easier right so what is a relay a relay
[17:00] is a a small laptop a very very old
[17:04] laptop very simple laptop that only has
[17:06] like a a hard drive and a connection to
[17:08] to the Internet so when you sign
[17:11] something a picture you and I take a
[17:13] picture like yes we're having fun here
[17:15] boom you uploaded it not me you uploaded
[17:17] it because you uploaded it what do you
[17:19] what are you doing before sending it to
[17:22] this laptop hard drive you have to first
[17:26] attach or sign it with your signature
[17:28] I'm ring s I'm I'm I'm signing this
[17:30] picture with J boom you uploaded to the
[17:33] hard drive of this of this relay and
[17:37] then the relay owner if he shuts down
[17:39] his computer then nobody I I won't be
[17:42] able to see this picture because this
[17:44] picture it's a URL that goes to https
[17:47] blah blah blah going to the server of of
[17:49] this computer then imagine that yes he
[17:53] he keeps his computer on but then he
[17:55] wants to change the picture and instead
[17:57] of being the whole picture of you and I
[17:59] I don't know he just cuts it on the
[18:00] middle and now it's just your face he
[18:04] can do that and he because he's the
[18:07] owner of the or he he's not the owner
[18:09] he's the he's hosting
[18:13] the the picture file on his hard drive
[18:16] and if he installs Photoshop or
[18:17] whichever other app he can edit the
[18:20] picture but when you edit the picture
[18:24] the what what is a picture a picture is
[18:26] a a set of ones and zeros organized in a
[18:29] way using an algorithm that then with
[18:32] another um computer app which is like a
[18:34] picture viewer it can be like transcoded
[18:38] into pixels in and colors and and then
[18:41] you can see a picture but in the process
[18:45] when when you edit a picture and you
[18:46] create a new one and you save it the
[18:49] numbers and the ones and zeros of the
[18:50] original picture they change and the
[18:52] same happen with the signature so he can
[18:56] upload a new picture but then when I see
[18:58] it
[18:59] I will see that you are not you did not
[19:01] sign it so there will be this picture
[19:04] will exist there on his on his hard
[19:06] drive he can even delete the original
[19:09] picture that you posted there but it
[19:13] doesn't matter now because everybody
[19:15] that is following you could see that
[19:18] this picture was not signed by you
[19:21] another example of that is like you and
[19:23] I sign a a PDF a contract so you send me
[19:27] a PDF then I sign it digitally I send it
[19:29] to you then you don't like what what I
[19:31] signed then or you add one or two more
[19:34] pages you can do that but then when I
[19:37] see the file again I will see that the
[19:39] file has been edited after I signed it
[19:41] so then the validity of the signature is
[19:44] lost that is super interesting sorry for
[19:46] all those beginner questions but I I
[19:48] really have no clue about it and um it's
[19:51] it's always like an indication like if I
[19:53] don't have a clue about it it might be
[19:55] also big portion of my audience uh that
[19:58] also still doesn't know so I think this
[20:01] is really helpful um uh so I think I
[20:04] understood the the main concept of of
[20:06] Nostra now a little bit better um is
[20:10] there any way to find out how many
[20:12] relays there are and then like how much
[20:15] data is there on like is there because I
[20:17] know for example if like mining you can
[20:19] uh look at like um mol. space and Mining
[20:23] you see exactly where the mining pools
[20:25] are and and what percentage they have
[20:27] and stuff like that is something similar
[20:29] there for for Nostra yeah right it's
[20:32] like this is the same as with with notes
[20:35] with Bitcoin notes there is people that
[20:37] have a note at home and then they they
[20:41] transmit everything on on the internet
[20:45] like on the plain internet but then
[20:46] there is other people that is running
[20:48] notes under tour which is more more
[20:52] hidden under the eyes of the of the
[20:55] people on the internet so it's it's more
[20:58] difficult to know how many notes of
[21:00] course mining you need to know where are
[21:02] the mining machines that are like
[21:04] calculating all the hash making all the
[21:07] mathematical tools to then be able to
[21:10] tell them okay so you
[21:12] successfully uh achieved or or or
[21:15] discover these the secret numbers so
[21:18] then the the minor reward goes to you
[21:21] but the beauty of of of the relays of
[21:25] Noster it's because they are similar to
[21:28] the notes of Bitcoin I can tell you I
[21:32] can broadcast if I have one but if I
[21:34] don't want to I don't have to this is
[21:37] this is the beauty it's like we we don't
[21:40] know I mean I I've heard that there is
[21:42] like 100,000 relates out there but I
[21:47] don't know I I don't know because those
[21:50] numbers are as estimates it's the same
[21:52] way as like when they say like there are
[21:54] I don't know like 4 million Bitcoins
[21:57] lost how do you say they're lost no
[21:59] they're not lost the numbers are there
[22:02] maybe they haven't moved there for a
[22:04] while and then there is an estimation of
[22:05] if they don't move in whatever number of
[22:08] days years decades they're considered
[22:11] lost but the numbers are there and also
[22:14] as I was saying this is a
[22:16] very um we are in the early days of
[22:19] Noster we just celebrated four years
[22:22] when like uh a couple of weeks ago when
[22:25] when we met there in in El Salvador
[22:29] and this is like a tool for for for gigs
[22:34] so I could I could run a server for a
[22:37] couple of
[22:38] weeks and then shut it down and then
[22:41] next week I I do another one I I I start
[22:44] another one and so we cannot say so
[22:47] there are some professional servers that
[22:49] of course they are they are there like
[22:51] all the people that is all these
[22:52] companies that are building those
[22:54] clients you talked about Primal I talked
[22:56] about
[22:57] amethyst we can there are countless
[23:00] countless um clients they of course want
[23:04] to make sure that they offer a good
[23:05] service to their users so they're
[23:07] running their own relays the same thing
[23:10] with those with
[23:12] those Bitcoin lightning accounts as I
[23:16] like to call them like those those
[23:19] lightning wallets that you are not the
[23:22] owner of your keys like wallet of
[23:25] Satoshi for
[23:26] example he he has to make sure that he's
[23:29] run running one node with so many many
[23:32] channels because he wants to offer a
[23:34] service to his audience so the same
[23:36] happens with uh with Noster clients and
[23:41] the more clients that that will appear
[23:45] in that will come that will that will
[23:47] exist in the next years then the more
[23:50] professionalized the
[23:53] infrastructure below those clients will
[23:55] be built so this is like the early days
[23:58] of I think of Amazon web services so
[24:01] Amazon web services it's now like I
[24:03] think it's half it's a astonishing
[24:07] number it's half of all these Cloud um
[24:11] service providers it was built for
[24:13] Amazon because they just wanted it they
[24:16] they wanted to have an infrastructure to
[24:18] hold their website and then they
[24:21] realized that they could sell it to
[24:23] third parties so the with the with the
[24:27] launch of every new um technology there
[24:31] will be
[24:32] professionalization sorry
[24:34] professionalization of all the sections
[24:37] of this business so at the moment I
[24:40] think we are in the early days where you
[24:42] and I can build a can build a a relay
[24:45] that people can use but in 10 in 10
[24:49] years I don't know now this video how
[24:52] many megabytes how many megabytes per
[24:54] second is this using okay maybe we can
[24:57] run a relay from our home but maybe in a
[25:01] couple of years when when every video is
[25:03] not me it's not measured in megabytes by
[25:05] per second but maybe it's measured in
[25:08] terabytes per second and then you don't
[25:10] have like 10 people watching your video
[25:13] concurrently but maybe you have a 100 or
[25:15] a thousand then you will need a
[25:18] professional service that is uh that is
[25:21] um so maintaining this this peak or this
[25:26] demand of of users
[25:29] and and again and this is not nothing to
[25:31] to worry about because this is how all
[25:34] Technologies if if they are useful how
[25:37] how all Technologies evolve again to me
[25:40] like the main topic is that in Noster
[25:43] you're capable of saying whatever you
[25:45] want and your audience can verify that
[25:49] that's what you said nobody can fake it
[25:52] if if they fake it they lose they they
[25:53] break like we're doing on this example
[25:55] of the picture they break the
[25:59] the the linkage of your of your tool of
[26:02] your note with your signature and and
[26:06] this is the the word that they use note
[26:08] when I say note it's because Noster is
[26:10] notes and other stuff in Twitter I think
[26:12] they called posts in Instagram like
[26:14] pictures I don't I don't know how they
[26:17] how they call they are called in every
[26:19] social network but the idea here is it's
[26:21] a note a note can be a voice note text
[26:25] an audio message
[26:28] I like the name notes and other stuff
[26:32] transmitted over relay like it's it's
[26:34] very descriptional the the name of
[26:38] it yeah yeah who knows to be the name
[26:41] forever for the next years but this is
[26:45] so simple it's like we're trying to be
[26:48] so transparent here and and everyone who
[26:52] wants to jump in this is free open
[26:55] source so you can build on top anything
[26:57] can be built buil on top of no it's like
[26:59] all the wallets that can be built on top
[27:01] of of Bitcoin and people people have to
[27:05] experiment with that that's that's the
[27:06] beauty of open source
[27:09] code super interesting um what is from
[27:13] those really Runners because uh I think
[27:16] a big part of why Bitcoin is so
[27:18] successful because it aligns incentives
[27:21] and it really gives you the incentive to
[27:23] to uh have a minor running especially in
[27:26] the early days to even have a a node
[27:29] running there are big incentives to do
[27:31] that uh and now obviously you also have
[27:34] a big incentive to hold Bitcoin yourself
[27:37] um the incentives slowly slowly get more
[27:40] to also spend Bitcoin to transmit in
[27:42] Bitcoin uh so like there's always like a
[27:45] huge incentive and that's why Bitcoin is
[27:47] such a beautiful technology because uh
[27:51] as as as long as humans are greedy
[27:54] Bitcoin will work uh so like it's a it's
[27:56] a really simple s simple thing where you
[28:00] just align the financial incentives of
[28:02] the whole world and Bitcoin will
[28:04] automatically spread across the across
[28:06] the globe um maybe greed is is the wrong
[28:09] word for it but I think you know what
[28:12] what I mean um what incentive do users
[28:17] have to um uh obviously if if people
[28:22] post on there they get SS uh that's like
[28:25] kind of the incentive to post more on on
[28:27] Noster especially for the early people
[28:29] because you probably get sooner some
[28:32] some revenue for that like that's a big
[28:33] incentive to post there but what are the
[28:36] incentives for Relay uh owners for like
[28:39] people that run those relays they have
[28:41] to buy the hardware the computer they
[28:43] they have to do that what is the their
[28:45] incentives to to do so so at the
[28:48] beginning I thought that those
[28:51] incentives are not for for like plebs
[28:55] right like a Bitcoin note might be
[28:58] interesting for a ple if he is going
[29:01] down this Rabbit Hole of learning about
[29:04] privacy because what the main to me the
[29:07] main benefit and note for Bitcoin gives
[29:10] you is privacy Everything You broadcast
[29:13] to the Bitcoin network is is not not
[29:17] seen by anybody anybody else
[29:20] can like align your IP address with that
[29:24] transaction and then create a connection
[29:26] like this IP address this IP address
[29:28] which normally is linked to a name the
[29:32] owner of the network connection is doing
[29:35] that transaction so for for me the the
[29:38] Bitcoin note incentive it's clear it's
[29:40] privacy once you want to get more
[29:42] privacy inside of bit but for Noster I
[29:46] don't think there is like such a big uh
[29:51] incentive because everything you post in
[29:54] social networks normally is uh is tied
[29:58] to to to an identity as well so it's
[30:00] like if you want to reach more followers
[30:02] then normally you don't you don't matter
[30:05] about what uh if you're posting with
[30:08] your picture or not so to me I I don't
[30:11] think that there is a a big incentive
[30:13] now for plebs to run Noster relays so
[30:16] it's more like companies that they is
[30:18] what I was saying before like these
[30:20] companies that are playing around with
[30:21] the technology to build this
[30:24] infrastructure so then when the clients
[30:27] the
[30:28] and let me explain again what the client
[30:30] is the client is this app that uses
[30:33] Noster like the Wallets on on bitcoin
[30:35] it's an app that you have to use like
[30:37] Primal to connect to to Noster to see
[30:40] what's going on what your friends are
[30:42] posting so to me what I'm saying is that
[30:45] the incentive is more um is more
[30:48] interesting for the
[30:53] computer like technology
[30:55] providers that are helping build
[30:58] the tools for the average user the
[31:02] incentive is not run this these relay
[31:07] but rather use the client that will
[31:10] allow
[31:11] him not only as I was saying before make
[31:15] sure that everything he reads from
[31:17] anybody can be verified that this person
[31:20] posted but also for the Creator's
[31:23] economy like most of these of these
[31:26] people that is using social networks
[31:29] they are like building like their
[31:31] personal Brands and maybe they are
[31:34] experts in one topic or on another one
[31:36] and what they want to get is exposure to
[31:39] get an audience and then based on that
[31:41] audience maybe they can monetize it so
[31:44] to me like the incentive is more to use
[31:46] the tool itself and not bother about how
[31:49] to run the technological part of of of
[31:53] the of the business because imagine you
[31:56] are a photographer you're a photographer
[31:58] maybe you like to go places visit
[32:00] amazing Landscapes and take pictures so
[32:03] this is what you like but maybe you
[32:04] don't like to have to learn about how to
[32:08] have like hosting service to upload
[32:12] those pictures how to then connect it to
[32:15] the Internet so if the if there is a
[32:17] peak of users going the server doesn't
[32:19] go down so I think more more interest
[32:23] for the creators that they can focus on
[32:26] their area of Interest you're a photog
[32:27] pher take pictures if you're a cook
[32:30] maybe you want just to record
[32:33] yourself cooking recipes and posting it
[32:36] to your audience maybe on on a on a v on
[32:40] with with videos or maybe you like to to
[32:42] write and you just like to be immersed
[32:46] in the process of writing so you don't
[32:48] have to know how all these
[32:50] tools how if you need to buy a bigger
[32:52] server for the videos of of your cooking
[32:54] recipes or if you need um a a bigger
[32:58] connection to the Internet so the user
[33:00] so the the incentive is more of using
[33:04] the tool that is sustained by maybe
[33:09] amateurs or professionals because one of
[33:12] the things that I didn't mention you yet
[33:14] about Noster is that for all those
[33:17] creators out there if you're posting
[33:19] your video on YouTube probably YouTube
[33:22] is taking a cut of course because
[33:23] they're doing a job right so they're
[33:25] hosting all these infrastructure they
[33:27] posting commercials and then you have
[33:29] your Partnerships and based on that a
[33:31] part that goes to you and a part goes to
[33:33] to the people who help you build that
[33:35] that infrastructure but on Noster if I
[33:38] like if if you post if you Robin as as
[33:42] yourself Robin say writes like a long
[33:45] post a long history about Bitcoin and I
[33:48] like it I can
[33:51] directly zap you this is how we called
[33:53] to send value for Value can I can zap
[33:56] you a couple of um of satosi directly no
[34:03] intermediary so this is more the value
[34:06] is more of using the platform to reach
[34:10] your audience directly limiting the
[34:12] number of intermediaries of course and
[34:15] of course I'm going back to the
[34:16] incentive of the question that you asked
[34:18] me the incentive of running a relay
[34:20] because the infrastructure needs to to
[34:23] to be sustained by someone I still don't
[34:25] know how these companies will make money
[34:28] but I have an assumption and we'll see
[34:31] maybe in a couple of years if I'm right
[34:33] or if I'm wrong so my hypothesis is that
[34:36] there are now these these companies the
[34:39] clients Primal amethyst
[34:43] damus whichever that they are they are
[34:46] releasing their softwares for free their
[34:49] clients but they have to pay for all
[34:50] this
[34:51] infrastructure and the code itself the
[34:54] base layer of Noster it's an open source
[34:57] protocol that is mainly sustained by
[34:59] volunteers that are like subsidizing the
[35:04] the
[35:05] technology so what I would like to see
[35:07] in the future or to make this self
[35:11] sustainable is that those clients that
[35:13] people are
[35:14] downloading maybe they need to be um uh
[35:19] they they they would need to pay to the
[35:21] underlying protocol to these people that
[35:23] is running all the servers and
[35:25] maintaining the
[35:26] software for using the software but
[35:30] because it is something that is so
[35:31] personal between you and I if if I again
[35:33] if I like your article and I zap you
[35:36] then what we can do is that part of this
[35:38] app goes to maintaining the client
[35:41] itself and the protocol and this is
[35:43] something that I'm not sure if
[35:45] somebody's playing around with it if
[35:47] somebody's doing it please reach out to
[35:50] me or or just comment or whatever but
[35:52] what I already seen is that if you and I
[35:55] let's go back to this example that we
[35:56] said about the picture you and I take a
[35:59] picture of us and you post it but you
[36:03] not only post it you mention me so when
[36:05] you do that some of the clients allow
[36:08] you to share with the person you post
[36:11] all the Zs that they're sending you so
[36:13] if you receive 10 Z 10 10 satoshis and
[36:16] you decide that well the P you took the
[36:18] picture so you you you want to have the
[36:20] biggest credit so it's like out of every
[36:23] 10 Satoshi that are sent eight go to you
[36:26] and two go to me you can do that right
[36:29] now with all these apps so my idea is
[36:32] that or my hypothesis is that in the
[36:34] future this is what will happen like um
[36:37] every zap but only the zaps that happen
[36:40] you know it's like not everybody will
[36:42] have to pay for using the platform only
[36:44] the ones that are getting value out of
[36:47] it so because this is more personal
[36:49] because in Noster you have what it's
[36:50] called like the social graph that Noster
[36:53] LS learns about you and everything you
[36:55] do it's creating uh
[36:58] uh it can create a recommendation on
[37:00] what you like what you don't like who
[37:02] you are connected to and he can
[37:03] recommend you things that you already
[37:04] like so the more that the more things
[37:06] you like the more things that are
[37:09] similar to what you see you will see and
[37:10] then the more C circular economies will
[37:14] be able to be built directly inside of
[37:17] of this nost I know I didn't ask you
[37:20] exact I didn't answer you exactly like
[37:22] what is the incentive for regular people
[37:25] to build relays but it's because at the
[37:28] moment I think that is not such a big
[37:31] incentive for for Regular People Like Us
[37:34] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[37:38] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[37:41] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[37:44] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[37:46] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[37:50] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[37:53] go out there and show that you are a
[37:55] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[37:58] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[38:01] dropped a completely new and amazing
[38:03] Genesis edition of their watch
[38:06] collections you have the date of the
[38:08] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[38:12] and of course also the block height and
[38:14] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[38:18] the level of detail they put in in this
[38:20] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[38:23] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[38:26] down in the descript descriptions I love
[38:28] those watches so so much if you watch or
[38:32] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[38:34] I'll guess you already already bought
[38:36] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[38:39] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[38:42] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[38:44] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[38:46] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[38:49] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[38:51] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[38:54] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[38:57] account with the code Robin at the
[38:59] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[39:03] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[39:06] to really level up your sovereignty as
[39:08] an individual you have to have the most
[39:11] secure self- custody setup you have to
[39:13] secure your own devices you have to
[39:16] protect your privacy you have to set up
[39:19] an inheritance plan and depending on
[39:22] where you live you even want to have a
[39:24] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[39:27] in in case something goes really really
[39:29] wrong and through all those steps the
[39:30] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[39:34] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[39:36] way.com
[39:38] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[39:41] minute free call to find out how you can
[39:43] level up your sovereignty but yeah that
[39:47] that could be in the future as you said
[39:48] like I think um I think for long-term
[39:53] scaling there needs to be an incentive
[39:56] for them to run realist that's are super
[39:59] efficient especially when we talk about
[40:02] video content uh and maybe a lot of
[40:05] video content um maybe you have like a
[40:09] long from video content platform or or
[40:11] you build like a Netflix on top of of of
[40:14] relay top of nostril where you really
[40:17] have big video files in whatever 4K and
[40:22] it has to run super smoothly because
[40:25] otherwise people will stay with Netflix
[40:27] and YouTube and with uh with Instagram
[40:30] Tik Tok and so on if it's not perfect if
[40:33] the user experience is not absolutely
[40:36] amazing nobody has an incentives to
[40:39] switch so like uh we we have to get
[40:41] there where the the
[40:44] relays uh they have to provide a really
[40:46] Professional Service uh and and I hope
[40:49] we we get there you also mentioned one
[40:52] really interesting point
[40:54] is I know there are people that work on
[40:58] ad Revenue also on Nostra like to
[41:01] implement th those things also on Nostra
[41:03] but right now it's basically just value
[41:05] for
[41:06] Value what do you think of uh value for
[41:10] Value versus add revenue of a business
[41:13] model is do you see value for Value
[41:15] something that is has a future uh with
[41:19] the micro payments and I can just like
[41:21] send you a fraction of a fraction of a
[41:23] scent or maybe I maybe in the future I
[41:25] can even send you a fraction of a toi uh
[41:28] for for something I think right now at
[41:30] least like one Satoshi the minimum of
[41:33] scent but yeah we we might be uh there
[41:37] if if Bitcoin grows we we might be able
[41:39] to send you fractions of a zosi um it's
[41:42] like those value for Value model the the
[41:45] future or do you also see ad Revenue
[41:47] something that will be dominant uh
[41:50] moving forward yeah and you touch on two
[41:53] things here like first of like the
[41:55] infrastructure is not capable now of
[41:58] doing like this video streaming
[42:00] streaming service which maybe Noster is
[42:04] not the tool for that which is fine
[42:06] maybe I don't want to watch a movie
[42:09] using Noster because I'm using Noster to
[42:13] to watch things that I can verify that
[42:16] the owner has said so if I'm watching a
[42:19] movie on Netflix I'm I'm happy I don't
[42:22] need to watch it through these new techn
[42:25] but if I'm watching a a of you you know
[42:29] now with AI I can put anything I want in
[42:31] your mouth so I want to use Noster to
[42:35] see everything you have to say because I
[42:37] want to make sure that what you're
[42:38] saying you said a movie nobody's gonna
[42:41] fake a whole
[42:43] movie
[42:44] to to say something that the movie
[42:46] wasn't intended to so it is more a tool
[42:49] for for freedom of speech Noster is
[42:52] built to to be able to verify that
[42:54] everything you hear you read you see
[42:56] it's by the by the person that that he
[42:58] said and then the other topic that you
[43:00] were asking like is value for value and
[43:02] then yeah of course the fraction
[43:03] fractions of Satoshi is I run a note a
[43:05] Bitcoin note myself uh a Bitcoin
[43:08] lightning note as well and I am routing
[43:13] payments from people that are using my
[43:15] note as a channel to get to another
[43:17] place and because my fees are so low so
[43:21] I sometimes receive uh what was it a, m
[43:27] so you I don't know for how how small
[43:30] you can you can cut this because it's
[43:32] just a matter of adding zeros right so
[43:34] it's like I changing this so yeah value
[43:38] for Value I think that it depends on on
[43:42] who your who your your audience is um
[43:47] I've been I've been working in startups
[43:49] for for the last couple 10 years and
[43:54] part of my my role was doing business
[43:56] development and discovering new business
[43:58] models for new products and new
[44:01] technologies that are emerging and every
[44:04] product and every
[44:06] service needs to have a specific
[44:09] business model for them we are now in
[44:11] Noster playing with value for value and
[44:14] you can talk to many um content creators
[44:18] like yourself that have audiences in the
[44:22] other part of the globe that they might
[44:24] not have access to a bank account and I
[44:26] know this is like typical topic of
[44:28] discussion like Bitcoin is not for us
[44:30] Bitcoin is for the people who who
[44:31] doesn't have like I think it's like two
[44:32] billion people in the world that don't
[44:34] have access to bank accounts so the
[44:36] value for Value I think it's useful for
[44:38] for these people that don't have like
[44:40] this type of of I don't know buying your
[44:43] product because they are so far away and
[44:46] then the ad Revenue uh business model it
[44:49] works but again it depends on who your
[44:53] audience is so you're in Austria maybe
[44:56] your audience is the english- speaking
[44:58] community of bitcoiners so every type of
[45:01] ad that you run on on your network needs
[45:05] to be focused on this type of of
[45:07] audiences so if I am if I am a
[45:11] kid uh in s Salvador maybe I don't care
[45:15] about the watches you know or or your
[45:18] sponsors maybe I don't care about that
[45:21] so this app is useless for for you as a
[45:25] content creator so I think that the
[45:28] value for Value it's a good other way of
[45:31] your audience to let you say thank you I
[45:35] like what you're doing I love your
[45:37] content especially for so I'm seeing now
[45:41] like this trend of we
[45:44] are we are stopping becoming employees
[45:49] we're starting to learn how to become
[45:52] maybe uh working from home employees and
[45:56] then remote workers and then maybe we
[45:59] have some sight hustles like like there
[46:02] is a path and people and this was um the
[46:06] trend that started 10 10 20 years ago
[46:10] with social networks not social media
[46:14] that's what we have today but with
[46:15] social networks empowering everyone what
[46:18] I what today is called the Creator's
[46:20] economy and of course the names will be
[46:22] changing so what I'm what I'm seeing now
[46:24] is like this trend of all my my young
[46:28] friends
[46:29] my Z my my gen Z friends they're all
[46:33] always talking about oh we can we can
[46:35] run this side hassle or this other side
[46:37] hustle people is starting to realize
[46:39] that they can monetize their skills on
[46:43] internet and we are seeing like a less
[46:47] interest of having a 9 to5 job that you
[46:51] start when you 18 and you finish when
[46:53] you are 60 whatever or 70 when you when
[46:56] you tire and we see more of a trend of
[46:59] even people that likes to discover new
[47:02] communities new countries no much that
[47:05] are willing to move their business with
[47:08] themselves so for these
[47:10] people they they need a a way of making
[47:14] their living so to me if all those
[47:17] creators join on Noster and they can
[47:20] start building their Community there
[47:23] they can make a lot of a lot of money
[47:25] from everywhere just with the with the
[47:29] uh value for value and of course this is
[47:32] not easy and it took me a while to
[47:34] participate in the value for
[47:36] Value um Market but everything is a is a
[47:41] process and I'm glad that Noster has
[47:44] this tool because most artists are the
[47:48] way they have to to reach Their audience
[47:51] I'm I'm telling you the the example of
[47:53] of artist because the the typical
[47:55] business model of an artist is is that
[47:57] maybe they spend one year researching
[47:59] and creating u a new a new piece of art
[48:03] then they have to to rent a gallery they
[48:06] have to Showcase their piece or their
[48:07] pieces of Art and hope and cross their
[48:10] fingers that the right people go to that
[48:12] Gallery at that precise moment and gets
[48:15] their art so they have
[48:18] to save a lot of money to leave one year
[48:22] out of nothing to create something that
[48:23] then maybe they can monetize so nost
[48:26] what they offer is like a way of you
[48:29] create a small piece of art today while
[48:32] you have maybe you are staring you're
[48:33] having uh you already have a job and
[48:36] maybe you have like a couple of hours
[48:38] free today and you start playing and you
[48:40] start discovering what is the skill set
[48:43] that you want to monetize and this
[48:45] allows you to verify very easily very
[48:47] fastly if if this is the the next PATH
[48:51] for you if this is what you have to to
[48:53] pursue and again no intermediaries it's
[48:56] a connection directly from the artist to
[48:59] Their audience it could be the social
[49:02] networks already promoted that but the
[49:05] difference is that social network if
[49:06] they don't like what you're posting if
[49:09] the piece the piece of art that you
[49:10] uploaded goes against the media
[49:14] guidelines of the week because today we
[49:16] have to talk about whichever war or
[49:18] whichever new president or whatever then
[49:21] you will not be able to see um if your
[49:25] audience will not be able to see see
[49:26] your art so the difference between
[49:29] social media and I'm telling you now why
[49:31] I differentiate between social network
[49:33] and social media social network is a
[49:35] network you connected to me I connected
[49:37] to this other person but social media
[49:40] it's just a way of hiding inside of a
[49:43] social network what traditional mass
[49:46] media has been doing all the time which
[49:48] is the rulers post what they what the
[49:51] what they want the the audience to talk
[49:53] about in that specific time and that's
[49:56] why even if you have 1 million
[49:59] followers if you post something on
[50:02] whichever social media platform all
[50:05] these million followers are not going to
[50:06] see what you posted it goes it is
[50:09] filtered first by the algorithm and it
[50:12] this happens maybe in a fraction of a
[50:13] second and then if it aligns to the
[50:16] social media message that they want to
[50:18] convey at the same at that moment then
[50:20] maybe half only uh 500,000 half of of
[50:25] your audience will see it so the
[50:27] difference between social networks and
[50:29] social media that social networks first
[50:31] was trying to to connect people but now
[50:34] that we almost are all interconnected
[50:36] social networks don't want us to connect
[50:38] what they want us is to stay there
[50:40] hooked in our phones like like this all
[50:43] the time like hours and hours and hours
[50:45] so they can streamline direct to our
[50:48] brain all these uh dopamine hits that we
[50:52] need to stay connected so then they can
[50:53] sell us the products that they think
[50:57] that we might be interested in buying
[50:58] maybe we don't care about those products
[51:00] but because they put it at the moment at
[51:02] the right moment that we are having like
[51:03] this dopamine Rush maybe we buy it so
[51:06] the difference between the social
[51:07] network and social media platform is
[51:09] that the social media is just trying to
[51:11] get you hooked because now companies
[51:13] are are competing against each other for
[51:16] attention they want us to be there
[51:19] because the more they we're there the
[51:20] more they can know about us the more
[51:23] profiling they can know about each of us
[51:25] they can cluster in groups and then they
[51:27] can make more money it's not wrong to
[51:30] make money based on the on ads if if if
[51:35] this is your business model for your
[51:37] platform but the problem here is that we
[51:40] users sometimes are not aware of we
[51:44] staying on those platforms not because
[51:46] we like it but because we are addicted
[51:49] so the idea of switching from from uh
[51:53] Legacy social media platforms to Noster
[51:56] is that Noster doesn't have this type of
[52:00] behavior what they what we have in
[52:02] Noster is the social graph which is what
[52:04] I said before is like a way of knowing
[52:07] about our tastes based on the people we
[52:10] follow so in Noster the important thing
[52:12] is who you follow who follows you and
[52:14] everything you say and in noer you can
[52:17] build your own algorithm if I don't like
[52:21] um cooking recipes I can say don't show
[52:24] me this but you know it's my choice
[52:27] it's not that today is not a topic of
[52:30] that we have to talk about and that's
[52:31] why the the tool itself cancels
[52:34] everything that has to be about this
[52:36] topic so you see like those are the the
[52:39] differentiations I do between social
[52:41] media social networks social networks
[52:44] are gone at least the way the way we
[52:46] know it and I think that that Noster is
[52:49] is trying to catch up on that we're very
[52:51] early we are just 4 years old and we
[52:55] know we don't know this is like like
[52:57] Bitcoin 10 years ago right we we don't
[53:00] know where this is going to go the good
[53:02] thing is that this is an open protocol
[53:04] and we can all build on this and and
[53:06] that's why I'm I'm part of that and
[53:08] that's why I'm on Noster because I
[53:09] believe that we have better ways to
[53:12] connect to each other better ways to
[53:14] express ourself and better ways of
[53:17] monetizing all of our skills that we
[53:20] have that maybe we still don't know I
[53:22] don't know maybe you can play the guitar
[53:24] and and you don't know that your
[53:25] audience is interested in that okay just
[53:27] play with it maybe if I like it I will
[53:30] send you 10 satosi 20 1,000 satoshis
[53:33] this this is the the value I see of of
[53:36] Noster interesting I like the more I
[53:40] think about Noster the more I'm like uh
[53:43] it it could be something that we
[53:44] actually use in in in in the future and
[53:47] that might actually be there I see some
[53:50] problems uh with scaling and with like
[53:54] those uh let's see like the the where we
[53:58] go from we are now like a small
[54:02] community to like we go to like a mass
[54:05] Market of like maybe five to 10% of the
[54:08] world population is on noer where we
[54:10] slowly get to uh those ad Revenue models
[54:14] are then built in then clients get built
[54:18] that are super addictive again because
[54:20] that's how you get the people and like
[54:22] all those problems we have now with
[54:24] social media um
[54:27] I think have a good chance also to come
[54:30] to Nostra if it's successful uh because
[54:33] it's just human behavior like we we
[54:36] we're getting addicted to those toam Min
[54:38] hits uh and uh from a techn technology
[54:42] samper we could like I'm not saying this
[54:45] is where NOS I'm not saying that NOS
[54:48] will end up at the same place that is
[54:49] social media right now I'm just saying
[54:52] that's one of my concerns that we just
[54:56] build building the same thing that we
[54:58] already have um a little bit more
[55:01] decentralized and that little bit more
[55:03] decentralized might be uh good enough
[55:06] like that might be uh already the the
[55:09] small thing that we need for freedom of
[55:10] speech because you can sign a
[55:12] transaction not not you can sign the
[55:14] message that you do uh you can then uh
[55:17] decide for yourself and uh choose
[55:20] algorithm there will be probably a
[55:23] bigger um
[55:26] you you can you can get your account
[55:29] from one client to another client so for
[55:31] example if you now build a huge audience
[55:33] of on Twitter you can just not just take
[55:36] that and put it on YouTube uh but with
[55:39] nost that's possible so there are a lot
[55:42] of incentives to have really the free
[55:45] market of
[55:46] clients um but so that that's kind of
[55:49] the positive side of things that that I
[55:52] see uh but I I I really am impressed
[55:55] with nost and development in the last
[55:57] year uh I think the last year was
[55:59] extremely positive and extremely good in
[56:02] terms of what what has been built uh and
[56:04] I'm just fascinated by the by the topic
[56:07] because it is
[56:09] the it is the
[56:12] 201 12 of of Bitcoin maybe 13 yeah where
[56:17] we are at such an early point where
[56:20] there are still so many questions open
[56:23] 2011 12 like
[56:26] if if you went all in Bitcoin in 2011
[56:30] you were a
[56:31] maniac there were so many questions open
[56:35] the same the same now with with with
[56:38] Nostra obviously now it's not about
[56:40] financial energy you don't you don't
[56:41] have to gamble your life savings into
[56:44] Nostra you can just like play with it
[56:46] and and do something with it like a few
[56:48] minutes every week and you're kind of in
[56:50] the game uh so the barrier to entry is
[56:53] definitely smaller I would say but I I
[56:57] just I'm really fascinated by it and and
[56:59] if I think
[57:01] Nostra could be a huge topic moving
[57:05] forward also on this podcast I think
[57:07] that that I have now maybe maybe three
[57:11] or four or five podcast episodes where
[57:13] we talk mainly about Nostra um and maybe
[57:16] 20 or 30 episodes where there are some
[57:19] Nostra talks in there or something like
[57:21] that and I think the it it will continue
[57:24] to accelerate so yeah really cool uh I I
[57:28] I like it a lot how how it uh how it
[57:31] develops um one thing that if we compare
[57:34] to bitcoin Bitcoin podcast I have to ask
[57:37] that are there are there com is there
[57:40] competition to Nostra that does kind of
[57:43] the the same thing can there be a second
[57:45] best
[57:46] Nostra W good question it's like Bitcoin
[57:49] right it's open source free code anyone
[57:52] can build a a Noster to anyone
[57:57] but so far people is using Noster
[57:59] because for whichever reason we believe
[58:02] that the protocol that Noster set up or
[58:06] or gave us is good enough so this is how
[58:10] you build um an open source project you
[58:13] start you share your code your code base
[58:16] then some developers start contributing
[58:18] to the software and then if there is
[58:21] some disagreement then you decide to to
[58:25] do a fork and and then you go through
[58:27] through another path at the moment
[58:29] everybody is building on top of Noster
[58:33] but who knows time will tell and because
[58:36] of the free market competition as you
[58:37] were saying of the clients if one client
[58:41] for whichever reason switches to another
[58:44] protocol the others will see what is the
[58:47] the best one to to adhere to at the
[58:50] moment yeah four years in the making
[58:54] it's what people is using interesting
[58:56] yeah the I I hope we get to the point
[59:00] where um we have full freedom of speech
[59:04] like I I truly don't care how we get
[59:07] there the the same way I don't care
[59:10] about how we get to sound money how we
[59:13] get to a good Financial system I think
[59:15] Bitcoin is the way uh but if all of a
[59:18] sudden tomorrow erupts something better
[59:21] uh and it takes the whole world
[59:22] over I put that uh possibility at like
[59:26] 0.1% but if that happens I'm fine like I
[59:30] won't sound money right exactly the
[59:33] technology is just a tool to arrive
[59:35] there doesn't matter doesn't matter if
[59:37] if if you're a fan of uh blue and I'm
[59:40] fan of of red you know it doesn't matter
[59:43] we the tool that we're using to to reach
[59:46] a goal is the goal is the important
[59:49] thing and now so far this is what we
[59:51] have we have Bitcoin we have nost and
[59:53] the community is building h absolutely
[59:56] really cool perfect then uh we have um
[60:00] uh uh we we we talked before what we can
[60:03] talk about like and we wanted to talk
[60:05] about saltis the things that you also
[60:08] doing took a long time to to get here
[60:11] but uh what is santis and and and and
[60:13] and what are you actually doing there
[60:16] right I mean I have some idea right of
[60:18] of of the of the talk but I'm I'm So
[60:20] Into Noster that to me like everything
[60:22] gravitates to to Noster and this is why
[60:25] I join Satan because santis is one of
[60:28] these other clients and as you were
[60:30] saying if you're a user of Noster it
[60:33] doesn't matter which client you're using
[60:35] there are clients that are more focused
[60:36] on text long text Twitter
[60:40] threats
[60:42] podcast uh music um videos there are
[60:46] many clients and of course there are
[60:48] clients that are doing the same thing
[60:49] like many are doing text or many are
[60:51] doing podcasting so Atlantis is just
[60:54] another and and again I want to talk
[60:57] much about the tool itself what I'm
[61:00] trying to say is that everything you do
[61:02] in every of those clients it's written
[61:06] in a way that if this client dies if
[61:09] this client disappears tomorrow it
[61:12] doesn't matter to you because the data
[61:14] your data is never stored on those
[61:16] clients again I'm repeating the meaning
[61:18] of client a client for regular people to
[61:22] understand it's it's an app an app that
[61:24] you download on your phone that that's
[61:26] that's a client like Twitter inside of
[61:28] Noster that would be like a client so
[61:32] what I'm saying is that now all the apps
[61:35] that you download on your phone
[61:37] everything that that you do there it
[61:39] stays there with them because they are
[61:41] normally companies and they are the
[61:44] owners of this data when you sign like I
[61:47] agree terms of condition and all this
[61:48] what happens there is that you're
[61:51] selling your your soul to the devil
[61:53] right it's like you're saying everything
[61:54] I'm doing now is yours and you grant me
[61:57] access to this information until you
[62:00] decide to stop granting me this access
[62:02] so what I'm saying what I'm trying to to
[62:04] explain here is that all these clients
[62:06] what they are is just they're just
[62:08] glasses they are glasses of seeing the
[62:10] world and today you can wear the blue
[62:11] glasses tomorrow the orange glasses or
[62:13] whichever glasses and you see the W in
[62:16] different ways and what I'm seeing what
[62:17] I'm saying w i mean the speech that
[62:19] you're sharing to world so if you don't
[62:22] load uh we talked about um
[62:26] Primal right before Primal is it's it's
[62:28] a clone of Twitter so everything that I
[62:31] post on my Noster account through Primal
[62:33] you'll see it with a UI with a user
[62:37] interface that is similar to Twitter sat
[62:40] lantis it's just another tool another
[62:42] client we are focused on Nomads and
[62:45] bitcoiners it's like we are building
[62:47] like like this directory this aggregator
[62:50] of information that is happening on
[62:52] Noster because now the problem with
[62:53] Noster is that it's so big every body
[62:56] can post you can post a picture you can
[62:58] post a note you can post um a long text
[63:01] you can post a video and you can post it
[63:04] from Vienna I can post it from
[63:06] Barcelona maybe I don't care you know
[63:09] now about what you're posting now and
[63:12] unless I know you and unless I know that
[63:15] I like your
[63:17] content and this is the same with with
[63:19] social network at the beginning you
[63:20] don't know anyone you need to maybe we
[63:22] need I met you in person and then
[63:25] through that I said can I have your your
[63:26] contact and that's how we connected but
[63:29] there are other ways especially what I
[63:31] was saying for these people that is
[63:33] changing their path no like I'm an
[63:35] employee now I work from home now I
[63:37] start doing some gigs on the side and
[63:39] then I decide to travel and then I I
[63:41] become my own boss so for these people
[63:43] that are normally traveling all the
[63:45] world they would like to know
[63:47] like-minded people or what's going on in
[63:50] the country or in the city they're going
[63:52] so we build a tool we build this
[63:53] aggregator of Noster everything that's
[63:55] going on on Noster we organiz it by
[63:58] cities so when I went to El Salvador and
[64:02] I went to
[64:04] Elon I had no idea that was my first
[64:06] experience there so before I went there
[64:09] I checked the Elon page on santis doio
[64:14] which is our website and then you you
[64:16] can choose there um can I see what's
[64:20] going on on Noster so everybody that if
[64:22] you were there posting things like oh I
[64:24] just arrived in Inon then I could see
[64:27] and then I could find you or then there
[64:29] is another tab that says uh Merchants
[64:32] there's a map if I want to go to a place
[64:35] a restaurant or a hairdresser or I want
[64:37] to make a I want to get a massage so you
[64:41] can choose from that map from that
[64:43] specific City where to go it's like
[64:47] imagine a Google Maps but the problem
[64:48] with Google Maps is that it's all fake
[64:50] right like I can buy I can buy 100
[64:54] positive reviews and and tomorrow I have
[64:57] 100 positive reviews in my account right
[64:59] why because I have to trust that Google
[65:01] Maps is telling me that those reviews
[65:03] are right and what are their incentives
[65:06] to tell me they are right they make
[65:07] money out of out of their Merchants
[65:11] being there so they're not going to be
[65:14] helpful to meet the user they're going
[65:16] to be helpful to their pockets because
[65:19] they want to make money so in our map
[65:22] every comment every place that is put
[65:24] put there needs to be signed by the roal
[65:26] owner so if I saw you posting like I'm
[65:29] here in in Elon I saw your picture and
[65:32] then I saw that you have a a review on
[65:37] on whichever restaurant you went to then
[65:39] I I'm certain for sure that that review
[65:42] is real of course you can fake it but
[65:45] you have to have to create a fake
[65:47] profile of you that create a lot of
[65:49] audience and then post it there so but
[65:51] the incentive is different it's like now
[65:53] I make you work you have to put the work
[65:55] work whereas in Google Maps or in Trip
[65:58] Advisor everything can be bought by one
[66:01] click there are those Bots that you pay
[66:03] or these farms and you can buy so what
[66:06] we're trying to do is like to to embrace
[66:10] all these qualities of Noster to help
[66:13] users or to help Travelers that are
[66:15] going around to verify that all the
[66:18] information that they see where as if
[66:20] it's information about the city about
[66:21] the merchants about the quality of of
[66:24] the city we have a section that is
[66:26] quality of the city so is
[66:28] it um is the air the air quality good
[66:31] are there roads in the street you don't
[66:33] know when you're going to a new place
[66:36] um is is the ambulance is the health
[66:39] system good enough so what we're
[66:40] building is based on this social graph
[66:43] people that follow you or people that
[66:44] have similar interest to you that you
[66:47] can really trust what's going on on that
[66:51] on that
[66:52] City I'm going now to uh to changai in
[66:57] in a couple in a couple of months I've
[67:00] never been there so but
[67:02] luckily we have a a page of chm Atlantis
[67:06] and I will use it to in advance to
[67:09] verify what's important to me and I know
[67:12] that if you Google changai on Google
[67:14] you'll have tons of blogs tons of
[67:17] Travelers blogs but again what gives me
[67:20] the trust that this information is real
[67:23] and it's not paid everything you you you
[67:26] and I can just set up a website now that
[67:28] it's called traveltips for nomad.com and
[67:33] we can start posting whichever content
[67:36] our advertisers advertisers tell us to
[67:39] post and then we put a lot of money on
[67:42] ads and then this is the it appears on
[67:45] page number one on Google and that's it
[67:48] so then we
[67:49] are we are falsifying we are we are
[67:53] telling the audience what we want so so
[67:55] in the end it's like the person or the
[67:59] organization with more money can control
[68:01] the narrative this is the Legacy social
[68:05] media platforms so what we're trying to
[68:07] build here is that it doesn't matter who
[68:09] you are if it doesn't matter if you have
[68:12] $1 or or or1 million dollars I I don't
[68:15] care because what I care is to if if you
[68:18] post your experience in chai because you
[68:20] are there because you are one of our
[68:21] ambassadors that he's been leaving there
[68:23] that has been uploading all the
[68:25] information so a burger cost this a
[68:27] hotel night in a fancy hotel cost this a
[68:30] massage cost that if we have like real
[68:32] people that is verifying what they say
[68:34] online then other people can can have
[68:37] like a a source of trusted information
[68:41] that can it can be not manipulated by
[68:45] the organization that has more money so
[68:47] that's what we're trying to build in
[68:48] Atlantis right so it's like at the
[68:49] moment now it's only um a directory of
[68:52] with all this information that I'm
[68:53] saying but we're trying to build then um
[68:56] a social networking section as well so
[69:00] you can interact with the users and then
[69:02] at the end of the of the journey like
[69:05] final stage of of the platform will be a
[69:08] place for creators to find ways of
[69:11] monetizing their their uh their content
[69:14] so if you are a podcaster I don't want
[69:16] you to care about having to think about
[69:19] oh the editing and the lightning and no
[69:21] I don't care I just want you to to to
[69:24] find your best
[69:26] um uh your best speakers and to be able
[69:29] to write your scripts
[69:32] and that that um areas of of work that
[69:38] are not adding any any value to you need
[69:40] to be done by anybody else so that's why
[69:42] we're trying like a tool of of Creator
[69:44] tools for all creators if you're an
[69:46] artist if you're a content creator if
[69:49] you are if you have some skill set if
[69:52] you're a a writer or whatever we want
[69:55] you users to be able to discover many
[69:58] places uh and and and visit any places
[70:01] so they can focus only on that and not
[70:03] worrying about the tedious parts of the
[70:05] job that of course at the beginning
[70:07] anybody has someone has to do it but the
[70:10] more you you start discovering what is
[70:13] what you like in your life maybe the
[70:15] less interested you are in doing that
[70:17] because they do not add as value as the
[70:20] the skill that you are that you are
[70:23] pursuing it's a little bit of you know
[70:25] an overview of what Atlantis is and I'm
[70:28] very I'm very glad that we are building
[70:30] that on top of Noster because as I was
[70:31] saying Robin if Atlantis dies tomorrow
[70:35] if we close the website tomorrow for our
[70:38] users it doesn't matter because
[70:40] everything they do Satan is just a tool
[70:43] and you can call it a technical tool and
[70:45] maybe people doesn't even need to know
[70:47] what Noster is we are just a tool that
[70:50] uses Noster to verify that everything
[70:52] that you say you said it and if you
[70:55] don't like if you use it for a couple of
[70:57] weeks because you're traveling like me
[70:58] to Chaya but then you don't travel
[71:00] anymore just L out you don't even have
[71:03] to delete the account because there are
[71:05] no accounts I mean you can create one if
[71:06] you don't have an Oster and we can help
[71:08] you to create an account but you can
[71:10] bring your your information from your
[71:13] you talked about Primal if you have a
[71:15] primal um the Primal client you can
[71:17] bring your sorry you can bring your user
[71:22] to satanis and you'll see everything the
[71:24] same thing all the information that you
[71:25] had in Primal now it's on Atlantis it's
[71:28] just as I'm saying Atlantis is it's a
[71:30] glasses a different type of glasses
[71:33] you're saying the same thing but the
[71:34] problem with you know with Travelers is
[71:36] that when they go when they go to Noster
[71:39] everything is
[71:40] disorganized and what happens they don't
[71:43] like to stay there they this is so so
[71:46] difficult we are just organizing
[71:48] information it's it's fascinating also
[71:50] the social craft of of things um I I
[71:54] really like the social craft right now
[71:56] on Twitter because it gives me a quick
[71:58] idea uh um so like if someone writes me
[72:02] on Twitter uh hey can I be on the
[72:05] podcast first thing I do is just like
[72:07] look in the profile uh and if a bunch of
[72:09] people that I follow follow
[72:12] him that in itself is a really big uh
[72:16] indicator for me that oh he might be
[72:18] interesting then I see what what he does
[72:20] he write on his bio has he been on other
[72:23] podcast what does he write on Twitter
[72:25] and then like I have really quickly in
[72:27] profile of him but if he's not on
[72:31] Twitter and maybe he's on LinkedIn it's
[72:34] harder for me because in LinkedIn I have
[72:35] a very small substance I have like I
[72:39] only follow a few people there uh and I
[72:42] have way fewer connections there then
[72:44] I'm like yeah I don't know like I don't
[72:47] get the inside as good so having that
[72:50] social graph yes all over over them uh
[72:55] and connecting it with Google Maps like
[72:58] seeing on Google Maps um what are my uh
[73:02] uh people on on that I follow like that
[73:05] I have I follow maybe 500 600 people um
[73:09] and maybe those from those 700 people
[73:13] 200 has been already uh to that one
[73:16] hotel uh in in Abu Dhabi and like maybe
[73:20] 10 of them wrote a review those 10
[73:22] reviews are way more relevant to me than
[73:25] from random strangers so that's that's a
[73:27] really interesting use case and that's a
[73:30] really interesting thing um to do for uh
[73:35] the future
[73:36] of of everything like of the internet
[73:38] basically of like uh Google maps of of
[73:42] social medias of every everywhere where
[73:45] you maybe need a social graph you need
[73:49] you need to trust people on the internet
[73:50] so i' I've been now I'm in the creators
[73:53] economy which is how it's called today
[73:55] and five 10 years ago in 2014 I started
[73:58] a startup in the what this was called at
[74:01] the time the sharing economy and I was
[74:03] inspired by the beginners at the time
[74:06] which were which were Airbnb in the US
[74:10] Uber as well in the US and blbl car they
[74:13] are a a French company that expanded all
[74:16] over Europe and for the audience that is
[74:19] not from Europe blabar was a service
[74:21] where you could share a right so this is
[74:26] not like uber that Uber comes to you and
[74:29] he drives you whatever you tell him no
[74:32] no no sharing a right so if you Robin
[74:35] are driving from Vienna to Clen for and
[74:39] I want to do the same route then I could
[74:41] find you and then we could share the
[74:43] right so I was in I was inspired by
[74:46] those three companies and and I launched
[74:48] my own startup that U was trying to do
[74:52] the same with uh with education which
[74:55] it's not important for for the moment
[74:57] but what's important is that blabar they
[75:00] created a framework for trust for
[75:04] strangers and this is what what we have
[75:06] been trying to crack like I'm talking
[75:11] about 2014 right it's been 10 years and
[75:14] the problem with those types of
[75:16] Frameworks is that they can all be
[75:20] broken um you're
[75:23] saying if somebody reaches up to you on
[75:25] Twitter and then you check his profile
[75:29] and then you see that he is connected to
[75:31] the same people as you
[75:32] are that's today but if tomorrow Twitter
[75:36] for whichever reason decides that that
[75:39] account doesn't need to follow these
[75:41] same people that you are following click
[75:44] then this account has zero followers all
[75:46] his work that he has put on Twitter it's
[75:48] gone maybe five years of work creating
[75:51] an audience creating their topics the
[75:53] topics they were talking
[75:55] gone like that so Noster might seem like
[76:00] a a tool a very a to in the very early
[76:05] stages but nobody's going to think about
[76:08] using it because nobody has most of of
[76:11] of the audience today has never suffered
[76:14] of being cancelled on those social
[76:15] networks but probably somebody of you
[76:17] know that I have a friend that for
[76:20] example in my case I have a friend who
[76:22] had an Instagram about cats and for
[76:24] which ever
[76:25] reason from one night to the other
[76:28] Instagram decided to close that account
[76:30] it was just cats you know there was no
[76:32] political message or what so for
[76:34] whichever reason like these big social
[76:36] networks they are automatically run by
[76:38] algorithms there is no people behind it
[76:40] so for whichever reason the algorithm
[76:42] thought that that account didn't follow
[76:45] the company terms and conditions and he
[76:48] decided to close that account okay it's
[76:51] just a funny account for cats but
[76:53] imagine you're putting all your work on
[76:55] social networks and then you are not on
[76:58] control of of your audience of your
[77:02] content of your Revenue stream tomorrow
[77:06] you lost your job you wake up one day
[77:08] and oh they deleted all my all my
[77:11] accounts go fight go fight Google go
[77:13] fight YouTube You're nobody I mean when
[77:16] I'm saying you I'm referring to the
[77:19] early um entrepreneur that's starting a
[77:22] career because the
[77:25] the bigger the content creators become
[77:27] the more they start thinking about
[77:29] decentralizing and not posting
[77:30] everything on on on YouTube you're
[77:33] posting as well on Twitter because
[77:35] you're creating a a safety network but
[77:37] that costs it costs you time how much
[77:40] time do you have to replicate everything
[77:41] you're doing to all all all the networks
[77:44] and it's not only the content that you
[77:45] have to upload that of course you
[77:47] can ask someone to do it for you but you
[77:50] have to create an audience in each one
[77:52] of those networks so and I think that
[77:55] Noster is not yet for everyone because
[77:58] people is not thinking that far away in
[78:00] that situation this will happen so now
[78:02] we are building the building blocks for
[78:05] whenever uh a big outage happens and
[78:10] then in that time it's when and I don't
[78:12] know if this will happen next year or in
[78:13] 10 years you know like this is one of
[78:15] those it's like the the lockdowns this
[78:17] is a surprising thing that you you
[78:18] cannot plan in advance you just get
[78:21] caught there so what I'm saying now is
[78:24] that to all content creators that are
[78:25] hearing us so start thinking about ideas
[78:30] and start playing around with that
[78:32] because maybe one day you get kicked out
[78:34] of YouTube and maybe that's your main
[78:38] source of income and then what and then
[78:41] you are in the street so this is why
[78:44] Noster was built and that's that's why
[78:48] people should think about using it not
[78:50] not more about incentives and the zaps
[78:53] and validating it's more about if you
[78:56] are Your Own Boss because you are
[78:58] building your own product you're selling
[78:59] your own
[79:01] Services you have to to think about who
[79:04] you're partnering with so most of those
[79:06] content creators they are single
[79:08] entrepreneurs and I'm I'm trying now to
[79:11] think or or to reach out this audience
[79:13] that has built companies that normally
[79:15] are are not single owned companies but
[79:18] Partners Partnerships with other
[79:19] partners that's the same when you're a
[79:22] single owner of your content you believe
[79:26] you're you're a single owner but no you
[79:28] just partner with YouTube so YouTube is
[79:31] your partner you have to choose very
[79:33] carefully who your partner is and what
[79:35] control he has over you I'm talking
[79:37] about YouTube as I could be talking
[79:38] about any other social media Legacy
[79:41] platform I don't have anything against
[79:42] YouTube I I enjoy watching your show on
[79:45] YouTube but we don't know what will
[79:47] happen in the future so you have to
[79:49] think about who are you partnering with
[79:52] to to prepare for uh for your um your
[79:56] professional career that's what Noster
[79:59] is about and I know you want you ask you
[80:00] were asking me about santis but you see
[80:02] everything goes down to me to to the
[80:04] same
[80:05] point yeah and and I have like a bunch
[80:09] of other questions but I
[80:13] think yeah I think like we we we can um
[80:19] uh put put that in a in a second round
[80:21] like in half a year year something like
[80:23] that I think that it would be really
[80:25] interesting the only thing uh that I'm
[80:28] also interested in because you wrote me
[80:30] that you're an airline pilot or you were
[80:32] an airline pilot um H how did how does
[80:38] an airline pilot come to to work in
[80:41] Nostra and Bitcoin and is that way maybe
[80:44] may maybe you can shortly just give us a
[80:46] little bit of your background of like
[80:49] airline pilot and now Bitcoin as it's on
[80:53] on your sh
[80:55] what is written there
[80:57] Bitcoin especially free uh financially
[81:01] free financial financially free socially
[81:04] awkward nice do you agree with the with
[81:07] the explanation with the description uh
[81:09] yeah I mean I I might not be
[81:13] the I'm I'm maybe a more outgoing
[81:16] bitcoiner uh than the usual
[81:19] bitcoiner um but I I'm definitely not
[81:23] normal so like I I have a lot of
[81:25] socially awkward things definitely so I
[81:29] I would not say that I'm socially
[81:30] awkward but maybe maybe other people
[81:33] would describe me like that I think we
[81:36] are we all are in our in our level like
[81:40] this is not zero and one so that there
[81:42] is like a spectrum in the in the middle
[81:44] and and yeah and funny funny story I was
[81:48] a pilot in your country I was working
[81:51] for Austrian Airlines so this is that
[81:53] was my my first job my first real job
[81:56] after I graduated uh school and yeah and
[82:00] and at that time I remember I heard
[82:02] about Bitcoin I was like
[82:04] yeah that's okay it's just funny magic
[82:08] internet money and you know I have my my
[82:10] Fiat job my Fiat career I worked my ass
[82:13] off and then I realized like why I'm
[82:16] still poor so then I I thought about
[82:19] ideas of how to get out of of U of this
[82:23] Rat Race and I said said Okay so let's
[82:25] make money and then I started in the
[82:27] startup world like like this hockey
[82:30] sticks projection things and then I
[82:32] realized that yeah I'm I'm no Mark
[82:35] Zuckerberg right I'm no Elon Musk so
[82:38] startups like 99% fail after I think it
[82:42] was I think it's after five years 99% of
[82:44] startups fail some something like that I
[82:45] don't yeah it's it's like after three
[82:47] years it's a it's a major point and
[82:49] after five years there's another major
[82:52] point where startups fail uh heard some
[82:54] statistics around that and yeah like if
[82:57] if you make it past five years uh and
[83:00] you're consistently growing and your
[83:02] profit is growing and you're still alive
[83:04] after five years uh and you're like
[83:07] doing all those things I think you are
[83:09] past the startup uh point so like for
[83:11] the five first like three five years uh
[83:14] you're a startup yeah but sorry yeah so
[83:17] and I I successfully failed with my
[83:21] startup in the sharing economy after
[83:23] five years so successfully failed I love
[83:27] that it's it's like it's a path you
[83:30] learn I learned a lot then I started
[83:32] Consulting for other startups and in the
[83:34] meantime I was looking like why am I
[83:36] still poor what am I working my ass off
[83:40] and and doing all putting all these
[83:42] hours and every year my money is worth
[83:44] less and this is how I discover Bitcoin
[83:46] and now I am a a proud um member and
[83:51] organizer of the Barcelona Bitcoin only
[83:54] group so if anybody is listening that is
[83:57] in Barcelona that will come to Barcelona
[83:59] just ping me because we are running one
[84:02] Meetup every month many workshops even
[84:06] meetups are free free and they are
[84:08] normally even in Spanish or in English
[84:11] and we have like a community and we tell
[84:14] what is the next Meetup going to be
[84:16] about so I'm very uh um interconnected
[84:19] with the Barcelona Bitcoin community so
[84:23] anybody coming to Barcelona please reach
[84:25] out to me and I i' love to see you in
[84:27] person in in Barcelona and of course
[84:29] because I'm a bitcoiner and when you
[84:32] start thinking about how to fix money
[84:34] how to become self- sovereign you start
[84:36] talking about other topics which are
[84:39] like uh low time preference like things
[84:41] that will help improve Society at the
[84:44] longer at the longer term and this is
[84:46] how I discovered Noster and that's why I
[84:49] joined santis to to be part of this
[84:51] journey and to help of course used to be
[84:53] a pilot traveled a lot I like traveling
[84:56] and Satan you know it's like a mixture
[84:58] of traveling and Noster so it's it's the
[85:03] the perfect
[85:04] fit really nice yeah I like that a lot
[85:08] when when we talk about about uh the the
[85:11] personal stories I see that bitcoiners
[85:14] are going through so uh I I immediately
[85:17] I think we met in El Salvador at the UN
[85:20] conference if I remember correctly and I
[85:22] immediately clicked with you like you're
[85:24] like a really positive guy and I like
[85:28] your energy and so I really wanted to
[85:30] get that into the podcast and next to
[85:33] that energy we got to learn a lot about
[85:36] Nostra today a lot about how the future
[85:38] will will be in that I think you're I
[85:41] think you're honestly one of the top
[85:42] guys that can explain it in in simple
[85:45] terms like I not if I've been too
[85:47] technical because I will look back at
[85:51] this interview and probably I will see
[85:53] okay I was too technical here oh no you
[85:56] did you did an amazing job like at least
[85:58] for me like uh it's I always try to keep
[86:01] in mind my audience and and see like
[86:02] where where can I ask better questions
[86:04] and go deeper uh but I think I really
[86:07] like uh I I got a way clearer picture
[86:11] now of what Nostra is and what it tries
[86:13] to accomplish and what it could be yeah
[86:16] really cool thank you so much I have one
[86:19] question that I always ask every guest
[86:20] of mine what can we learn from you besid
[86:24] Bitcoin and I will add for you besides
[86:28] Nostra okay so that is something that of
[86:31] course my main focus since I was a kid
[86:33] is money right
[86:35] so I'm I'm always surprised by money
[86:39] what is money so I'm I'm I'm deeply
[86:42] interested into money and when I say
[86:44] money I'm not saying about how many
[86:45] zeros do you have in your bank account
[86:47] right about what is money like from the
[86:50] ancient ancient Egypts and the Romans
[86:52] and the Greeks and all all this story
[86:55] but all this converges to bitcoin so I'm
[86:57] not going to tell that because you don't
[86:59] want me to to tell Bitcoin so there is
[87:02] another thing that I I like a lot which
[87:04] is artistic gymnastics so this is
[87:06] something just a personal thing of mine
[87:08] I practice every day and this keeps me
[87:11] sane in in this world of of of
[87:15] Randomness and and sometimes decadence
[87:18] so Sports in my case artistic gymnastics
[87:22] love so much and post everything I can
[87:25] on my Instagram but it's just an
[87:26] Instagram about uh artistic
[87:29] gymnastics I after a lot really cool
[87:32] thank you so much J for for sharing that
[87:34] with us U Before I Let You Go uh we have
[87:38] all right we have the end routine before
[87:39] I almost forgot that uh where the
[87:41] previous guest is asking a question for
[87:44] the next guest without knowing who the
[87:46] next guest actually is and your question
[87:48] from the previous guest is about Bitcoin
[87:50] mining do you know what the bit X is and
[87:54] and what it does I know and in our
[87:58] Barcelona Bitcoin only Meetup we have
[88:01] invited the
[88:05] um nerx Builder and we are selling them
[88:08] so what is it it's it's like a small
[88:10] device like this this this size like
[88:13] this size little little bit oh and of
[88:15] course you can see my phone has a a QR
[88:17] code to the Barcelona Bitcoin only
[88:18] community so an airx it's like a orx is
[88:23] a like a a small device like double the
[88:25] size of a phone maybe that is that you
[88:28] can um plug in at your in your home to
[88:31] to play what is called Lottery mining
[88:34] because it's it's such a small device
[88:37] it's mining it's guessing all these
[88:39] numbers to block to to mine the next
[88:41] block but because it's very very little
[88:45] in compar in comparison to this um big
[88:48] miners we call it Lottery because you
[88:51] have a little chance of winning but
[88:53] still they call it Lottery mining but it
[88:55] still has more chance chances than
[88:58] regular Lottery to win to be one of the
[89:01] winners absolutely and it's it's great
[89:03] to get into Mining and then maybe
[89:05] connect with like an ocean po pool or
[89:07] something like that uh it's it's a it's
