[00:00] this is a debt-based economy they really
[00:02] want you to take on debt and spend it
[00:04] into the economy but what I'm doing
[00:06] taking it all and buying Bitcoin why
[00:07] don't I just go and take all the money I
[00:09] can find and buy Bitcoin they give it to
[00:11] you at 0% and if you can't pay it off in
[00:14] 18 months it usually turns into
[00:16] something like 29% so that's the Trap
[00:18] they want Americans to not be able to
[00:20] pay it back so they can get their 30%
[00:22] interest the ETF is an amazing product
[00:24] for everyone who has retirement money
[00:27] that's stuck and they would like Bitcoin
[00:29] exposure most countries will stack
[00:31] secretly the law of diminishing returns
[00:33] has never been really applied to
[00:35] something with a finite amount I think
[00:37] the math there is going to be
[00:39] interesting in the future because
[00:41] there's only 21 million and there's
[00:42] almost Infinity Fiat out there that will
[00:45] chase it so what is going to be
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] diminishing yeah you're doing an
[00:54] interesting experiment maybe we can
[00:56] start actually with the picture that you
[00:58] sent me wait I can I can put it up on on
[01:00] the screen uh if you want to think that
[01:03] would be an interesting starting point
[01:06] um let me quickly share that I just read
[01:09] it uh to it and then we can get into
[01:12] what you're doing with with credit cards
[01:14] so uh I I read it out loud because we
[01:17] have listeners that only listen uh the
[01:19] correct and successful Financial
[01:22] strategy under the Fiat standard is to
[01:24] con constantly take on as much depth as
[01:28] possible I cannot pronounce the next
[01:30] name next word be manous about making
[01:33] all payments on time and use the depth
[01:36] to buy hard assets that generate future
[01:39] returns doing this successively improves
[01:42] your credit scores and allows you to
[01:44] borrow at a lower rates while you store
[01:47] your wealth in Goods that cannot be
[01:49] inflated as easily as Fiat the Fiat
[01:52] system does taxes Savers and subsidizes
[01:56] borrowers the feed standard encourages
[01:59] everyone to live fra fragile lives and
[02:02] take substantial Financial risks the
[02:05] alternative is a slow continuous
[02:07] bleeding of wealth and you told me that
[02:11] this is the whole reason why you are
[02:15] doing uh the experiment with the credit
[02:17] card so maybe let's get into why are you
[02:19] doing it and and what are you actually
[02:22] doing yeah so yeah like you said that is
[02:25] the reasoning for my uh strategy that
[02:28] I'm running using unsecured credit and I
[02:32] happen to live in the USA so here in
[02:35] this country there's tons of you know
[02:38] credit card products for consumers with
[02:40] good credit and of course this is a
[02:43] debt-based economy so they really want
[02:46] you to spend credit and take on debt and
[02:50] what they want you to do is obviously
[02:51] spend it into the economy but what I'm
[02:54] doing obviously is taking it all and
[02:56] buying Bitcoin and sitting on it and
[02:59] interesting and that's really um I think
[03:04] a a novel approach to the Sailor
[03:07] playbook for regular people maybe we can
[03:10] call it like that um and I think we got
[03:12] in touch because I saw I don't know I
[03:15] think I saw an an exle sheet or some
[03:18] sheet where you actually tracked your
[03:20] credit cards uh do do you still track
[03:23] that and can can you share that yeah um
[03:27] I do do monthly updates on that and I've
[03:30] been posting it almost for a whole year
[03:32] now and in three days I will be posting
[03:35] the one year
[03:37] update oh nice so you started um this
[03:40] year basically a year ago yeah nice was
[03:43] it December uh last year or was it in
[03:46] January or uh no I started at the end of
[03:51] November last year oh perfect yeah we're
[03:55] approaching the one month the one year
[03:58] exactly so I'm by the way also
[04:01] approaching tomorrow the oneye
[04:03] anniversary of this
[04:06] podcast we start a different projects so
[04:09] this is the last update that I've made
[04:10] on September 30th and I generally
[04:14] post this here and I go through a bunch
[04:18] of statistics about it
[04:21] and your you we can share this later and
[04:24] your viewers can read through it but
[04:26] basically there's two images I share
[04:29] this this is every line item that I've
[04:31] ever bought and we track how up and down
[04:35] it is and what the totals are and then a
[04:39] chart version of the same thing
[04:42] here and I haven't updated the November
[04:45] one yet but as you can expect it's way
[04:48] high now uh what is the what is the
[04:50] other chart again uh let's let's get
[04:53] into some what are you doing there okay
[04:56] yeah so let's go back to here every line
[04:59] that you see here year is what I what
[05:01] the price that I have purchased it at
[05:03] back in the day last year in November I
[05:06] did some in December here as well and
[05:10] I've just basically tracked these uh
[05:13] purchases oh so so you basically bought
[05:17] for with money that you otherwise
[05:21] wouldn't have 1.44 887 87 Bitcoin that's
[05:27] correct I borrowed $54,000
[05:29] here in the end total oh that's that's
[05:32] an objective price so no that's the sum
[05:34] of the debt this is the sum of the debt
[05:37] the total all of the costs right and my
[05:40] average price is 37 down here oh wait
[05:43] wait why is the uh you you got
[05:47] 54,000 in in depth to to purchase those
[05:51] Bitcoin and yeah average price is 37,000
[05:54] yeah makes sense yep that is the big
[05:57] takeaway here for for the people that
[06:00] that that don't see that so basically
[06:03] you uh borrowed 1.44 Bitcoin uh you
[06:08] borrowed for that
[06:11] 54,000 um uh um 54,000 dollars uh then
[06:17] obviously the cost basis is lower than
[06:19] 54 per Bitcoin because you uh got more
[06:22] Bitcoin for that so 37,000 is the
[06:24] average price uh yeah and the current
[06:26] value is almost double now like that
[06:29] that that's really good a 70% uh gain um
[06:33] how like why did you uh start that
[06:39] project in in the first place we know
[06:41] the picture we know the reason but was
[06:43] there some some trigger that they like
[06:44] oh like I have to do that I want to get
[06:46] ahead I want to get to to some amount of
[06:49] Bitcoin is is what was your personal
[06:51] reason for doing that yeah so let me
[06:54] take you back to the very first version
[06:57] of this tweet that I put up it would be
[06:59] my pinned tweet that I have that I've
[07:02] made on November 25th last year and my
[07:05] purpose was every single day I was
[07:07] looking at headlines of money just going
[07:10] away to Ukraine hundreds of billions of
[07:13] dollars 50 billion here 100 billion
[07:15] there I was I was seeing this every day
[07:18] last year and I I I just really thought
[07:21] there was I mean if they're doing this
[07:23] then why not why don't I just go and
[07:25] take all the money I can find and buy
[07:27] Bitcoin why not that's why that's why I
[07:29] did it thing uh it's is is there uh and
[07:35] you can also unshare the screen if you
[07:37] if you like to uh but is there something
[07:40] where you like if the price Falls too
[07:42] much but you don't get into problems
[07:45] because uh your depbt is not uh tied to
[07:50] to the value of the Bitcoin right that's
[07:52] right the only risk here is me making
[07:55] the monthly payments that's all the bank
[07:58] care about they they don't care about
[08:00] bitcoin price so you have um you're
[08:04] dependent on the the income then um H
[08:07] how long of a project do you want to to
[08:10] do this
[08:11] for um so another thing about my project
[08:15] is all of the cards that I've borrowed
[08:17] are
[08:19] 0% but and they're typically from 18
[08:22] months to 21
[08:24] months wait you pay 0% interest rate
[08:28] that's right yes
[08:30] oh uh I I live in Austria so I don't
[08:34] know how America is is doing with credit
[08:36] cards but how does the American Credit
[08:38] Card system works that you can have like
[08:40] z% so that's why we started in the
[08:42] beginning saying for USA customers in
[08:45] America they do offer uh these
[08:48] promotional products where they will
[08:50] give you 0% for 18 or 21 months and then
[08:55] it's no longer 0% they want you to you
[08:59] know hopefully pay it off by then and if
[09:02] you can do that they give it to you at
[09:03] 0% and if you can't pay it off in 18
[09:07] months it usually turns into something
[09:09] like
[09:10] 29% so that's the Trap that uh they want
[09:14] you to fall into they want Americans to
[09:17] you know not be able to pay it back so
[09:19] they can get their 30% interest it's
[09:22] it's a it's a hard one I think a lot of
[09:24] people and especially the people that
[09:26] shouldn't fall for that fall probably
[09:28] exactly for that trap exactly these
[09:32] products are really designed
[09:35] for those people that really know what
[09:38] they're doing and are good with their
[09:40] money but they make it accessible to
[09:43] everybody of course and you know it's
[09:46] it's kind of predatory in my opinion to
[09:48] be charging 30% but that's the laws here
[09:52] in America and so the banks keep uh
[09:55] doing it um obviously uh uh we don't do
[09:58] any Financial
[09:59] obviously we we don't recommend that at
[10:02] all um but is there where like in that
[10:05] situation I would do it in that situ I
[10:08] would not do it uh what what you
[10:11] probably thought about the the risks uh
[10:13] involved with that very deeply and like
[10:16] obviously we don't know what what
[10:18] percentage of your net worth that is but
[10:20] uh 1.4 Bitcoin is a substantial amount
[10:23] uh what what are you thought about about
[10:26] the the risk
[10:28] involved yeah so obviously here the rain
[10:31] uh the risk involved is missing your
[10:33] payments on the debt you can never
[10:36] absolutely never miss a single payment
[10:38] because then you lose your 0% and then
[10:41] you'll get interest immediately so as
[10:44] long as you have everything set up on
[10:46] the autopay to make the payments every
[10:49] month then then you're basically good
[10:52] there is no risk and other than the than
[10:56] the obvious risk of you losing your job
[10:58] or somehow you can't pay
[10:59] that's the biggest risk as well but it's
[11:02] a it's it's a it's not a like it's it's
[11:06] it's kind of a big one still like I I
[11:08] would I would not feel comfortable uh
[11:11] doing that but that maybe that's just my
[11:13] my nature but it's it will be a really
[11:15] interesting uh thing to see uh when we
[11:18] started and then like two years later
[11:20] how it goes I think you picked a really
[11:22] good
[11:24] time for that yes risk is personal to
[11:28] everybody and it's different for
[11:30] everybody and it all just depends on how
[11:33] much room you have to service your debt
[11:37] basically and we can look at Michael
[11:39] sailor what he's doing it looks crazy
[11:43] what he's doing but if you look at his
[11:46] uh company and you look at his
[11:48] financials he can easily make the
[11:50] payments on all of the debt he's taking
[11:52] out so once you see that you don't see
[11:55] it as risky at all for him price doesn't
[11:58] matter even if it drops 80% like it did
[12:01] in 2022 he started this in 2020 if you
[12:05] remember and he went Bitcoin went down
[12:08] 80% I believe in
[12:10] 2022 uh something like that from you
[12:13] know 69 to 15 that's a big drop and
[12:16] still nothing happened there was no
[12:18] liquidation nothing because he's never
[12:21] missed a payment he's never defaulted
[12:23] and his cash flows from the company were
[12:26] enough to keep servicing his debt so
[12:28] there's no risk to
[12:30] him and it's something similar with me
[12:33] here what's your take on on micro
[12:36] strategy in in general how do how do you
[12:38] like that that company right now so
[12:40] funny enough my my day job career is in
[12:44] analytics and business intelligence and
[12:47] micro strategy is an analytics software
[12:51] uh company they have their product right
[12:54] which sells uh software and uh we're a
[12:58] competing product we use
[13:00] Microsoft and I think what he's doing in
[13:03] a as a pivot is absolutely brilliant
[13:07] because he is doing the extreme version
[13:10] of this taking all the money that he can
[13:12] find at
[13:14] 0% and just sitting in Bitcoin it is
[13:18] something that only
[13:20] people with strong companies can do and
[13:24] still no one else with that has other
[13:26] companies are doing it so he's the only
[13:28] one first mover advantage and I think
[13:31] he's uh going to be very successful then
[13:34] you're the perfect person the first time
[13:35] I ever asked that question on the
[13:37] podcast um obviously I know what micro
[13:41] strategy is doing uh from like oh yeah
[13:43] the business intelligence and data
[13:45] analytics but that's just like two
[13:48] random words for me because I have no
[13:50] clue what they actually mean
[13:52] so just because we mentioned micro
[13:54] strategies so many times already on the
[13:56] podcast so maybe you can break it down
[13:58] for for the people in the podcast what
[14:00] is micro strategy actually doing so we
[14:04] can all understand it yeah what they
[14:06] actually do dayto day is they they have
[14:10] a software anal like data analysis tool
[14:14] like a like a really fancier version of
[14:17] excel where business users can create
[14:21] charts and analyze the your company's
[14:24] data right if you're if you're like a a
[14:27] retail shop you pull in your data you
[14:30] can tell how many monthly sales you had
[14:32] last month last year it's just creates a
[14:35] chart for you and it's a reporting tool
[14:38] thing so it's basically just an axel on
[14:40] steroids uh that get customized for for
[14:43] each company that's right yeah it's just
[14:46] a reporting tool and it's and it's been
[14:48] out there for a long time many many
[14:51] decades now yeah absolutely yeah he he
[14:54] was I think the longest served uh
[14:57] publicly traded companies CEO in the it
[15:00] sector as far as I know I think so yeah
[15:03] one of the older ones yeah absolutely
[15:05] really cool um and uh what do do you
[15:10] think um when when you have the choice
[15:13] between uh doing a leverage Bitcoin play
[15:16] and just buying micro strategy uh
[15:19] because that's kind of already The
[15:21] Leverage Bitcoin play in itself um how
[15:25] do you look at that would you choose
[15:26] like Bitcoin leverage spray or microsof
[15:29] obviously you chose probably uh this one
[15:32] I don't know if you have a micro
[15:33] strategy position no I don't have Micro
[15:35] strategy position because for me the
[15:38] most important thing is Cold Storage
[15:40] Bitcoin and something I hold and that's
[15:44] that's the ultimate uh importance to me
[15:47] Micro strategy is good because if you
[15:50] want like a huge dollar gain in the
[15:53] hopes of buying more Bitcoin later I
[15:55] think that's why people do it and the
[15:58] other reason people do it is they just
[16:00] can't buy Bitcoin for whatever reason
[16:03] right they have money in retirement
[16:05] accounts or something that they cannot
[16:07] buy Bitcoin so to them micro strategy
[16:10] would be the next best option other than
[16:14] the ETFs now yeah and and
[16:17] uh but but it's interesting it's it's
[16:20] almost like micro strategy is an a
[16:21] distract you from self custody Bitcoin
[16:24] because it is such a Bitcoin play and
[16:27] it's went up like crazy um I don't know
[16:31] what what was the statistics on it um
[16:34] micro strategy went up really really big
[16:37] this year alone I think they're still up
[16:40] 400% this year alone yeah that's that's
[16:43] crazy and if you compare that to bitcoin
[16:46] it it it is it is really something uh
[16:50] and it wait let let's see yeah 450% this
[16:54] year and then we then do Bitcoin US
[16:57] dollar uh it's
[17:00] 117% so that that's a huge difference
[17:04] basically for the same thing uh not I
[17:06] mean is it the same thing see we people
[17:09] have Bitcoin and then people have more
[17:11] dollars in their account because of
[17:12] micro strategy absolutely it's not the
[17:15] same thing um but it
[17:19] is people view it as the same thing like
[17:22] there are a lot of people out there that
[17:23] is like ah I don't want to be Bitcoin of
[17:26] cust I just buy Market strategy micro
[17:29] strategy was for a long time before the
[17:31] ETF for all the dreadfire guys just like
[17:35] the Bitcoin play I know right right and
[17:38] that's how it's continuing to be used
[17:41] now because they have all the momentum
[17:44] but like I said I still think people use
[17:46] it because they want more dollars and
[17:50] hopefully they exit and into Bitcoin
[17:54] themselves or they just simply cannot
[17:56] buy Bitcoin so this is all they can can
[17:59] do absolutely uh but it it it's it's
[18:06] like last last Cycles we all had this
[18:08] altcoins we all had this other things
[18:11] going on that served a distraction from
[18:13] Bitcoin is maybe the new distraction
[18:16] micro strategy from from the Bitcoin
[18:18] self custody um that's a good question I
[18:22] I mean last cycle we had the nft that
[18:24] was the biggest
[18:26] distraction and I mean that everyone got
[18:29] totally wrecked on
[18:31] nfts but this time I I don't believe
[18:34] you'll get totally wrecked in micro
[18:36] strategy you can say you can argue that
[18:38] it's a distraction from self- custody
[18:41] Bitcoin but but I don't think it ends in
[18:44] complete destruction to those who do
[18:47] hold micro strategy and if you can hold
[18:49] long enough because you know we all
[18:51] believe Bitcoin will be successful and
[18:54] so will micro strategy if they continue
[18:56] on their path they are now absolutely
[18:59] yeah um by the way what what are your
[19:02] thoughts on on the Bitcoin ETF how did
[19:04] you uh live live through that what was
[19:06] the anticipation of the Bitcoin ETF also
[19:09] something that that you thought about
[19:11] when when you were taking the credits I
[19:13] did that's why we I kind of did it in
[19:16] November it didn't occur to me because
[19:18] that last year we knew the ETFs were
[19:20] coming any day now any day now and so
[19:24] another main reason to get as much as I
[19:28] could as fast as I could was to front
[19:30] run the ETF that was a big goal it was
[19:33] to front run the ETF money which which
[19:36] successfully happened now now that we
[19:38] look in
[19:40] hindsight yeah absolutely what what are
[19:42] your thoughts on on the
[19:44] ETF I think the ETF is an amazing
[19:47] product for everyone who has retirement
[19:50] money that's stuck and they would like
[19:52] Bitcoin exposure I think trafi adoption
[19:55] is very important for the success of bit
[19:58] coin in America at least and that's
[20:01] where all the capital in the world is in
[20:04] America and it's the most important
[20:06] Market globally so I think I think
[20:10] success with the Bitcoin ETFs is a very
[20:12] good thing for Bitcoin going forward
[20:15] yeah it's the it's the adoption of the
[20:17] adoption phase is is kind of the the
[20:19] tread fi institutional adoption phase
[20:23] right now in in Bitcoin uh it's so
[20:26] different to the to the other ones uh we
[20:28] look at the the Bitcoin adoption uh
[20:31] right now with the institutional even
[20:34] with nation states with America maybe
[20:37] buying Bitcoin that that that thing
[20:39] would be crazy yeah I mean at some point
[20:43] that is what's going to happen next I
[20:45] think we can all see it but uh yeah that
[20:48] would be absolutely crazy that but I but
[20:51] I also think the nation states will do
[20:53] it in in secret I I don't think we will
[20:58] see everybody come out like El Salvador
[21:01] and announce they're doing something
[21:04] every day and show you the books I don't
[21:06] think it uh it'll be like that I think
[21:09] most people most countries will stack
[21:12] secretly I mean the USA is doing it I
[21:17] mean can can they buy Bitcoin in secret
[21:20] the USA for example obviously I don't
[21:22] know like there definitely countries
[21:24] that's smaller that probably can do that
[21:25] but is is the USA
[21:28] is it that the legal framework to do
[21:30] that or do they don't care or how would
[21:32] you how would that go in in America I do
[21:35] not think the USA can do it secretly you
[21:38] will see it in the price you would see
[21:40] it I mean unless they're buying 10
[21:43] Bitcoin okay then yeah they can secretly
[21:45] buy a low amount but but any serious
[21:49] amount cannot be done without moving the
[21:52] price right somebody would suspect I
[21:55] mean you would figure it out yeah but so
[21:58] so your theory is that other smaller
[22:00] countries are buying is in
[22:03] secret other I believe so I think so
[22:06] because
[22:08] because like your power as a country
[22:11] comes from like not knowing what what
[22:17] you hold right I mean you know what you
[22:18] hold but for example gold nobody knows
[22:23] what the amount of gold is held at any
[22:26] other country right we don't know what
[22:27] China holds we don't know what Russia
[22:29] holds but only they do and that's why
[22:33] everybody every country uses it as a
[22:36] posturing play you know they all stack
[22:39] gold but nobody can verify anything and
[22:41] nobody knows how much gold anybody has
[22:43] and and that's how they all have their
[22:45] power right I think it's the same for
[22:48] Bitcoin not knowing how much Bitcoin you
[22:51] have is I think a powerful positioning
[22:55] play because you can't just tell someone
[22:57] we have 1 million
[22:59] Bitcoin because because then they know
[23:02] you have 1 million Bitcoin but you
[23:04] should the USA should tell the world we
[23:07] are stacking Bitcoin and that's
[23:09] it you don't know how much we have and
[23:12] it could be millions or it could be
[23:14] nothing at all but they have a power
[23:16] play from just saying it I partnered up
[23:20] with coin vigilante this is the most
[23:23] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[23:26] saw created by anyone look at that

[25:25] minute free call to find out how You Can
[25:28] level up your sovereignty but isn't that
[25:32] kind of changing with with Bitcoin now
[25:34] because it is so verifiable and once we
[25:36] know uh
[25:38] like it's really hard to keep that
[25:41] secret where the Bitcoin probably is
[25:43] stored uh and and then we then we once
[25:46] we know the addresses like we we know we
[25:48] track the addresses of of big exchanges
[25:50] and stuff like that do you think that
[25:52] that will be uh or how what will Bitcoin
[25:55] change uh in when when we actually think
[25:58] ahead okay Bitcoin is replacing gold
[26:00] also in De recard what will then change
[26:02] with Bitcoin what we maybe not have with
[26:05] with gold I think the chain analysis
[26:08] people that track the data are very
[26:10] smart people but but I don't think they
[26:13] can still tie it to to a government
[26:16] right I don't think that's going to be
[26:18] very easy still you have the data but
[26:21] you still don't and you know the amounts
[26:23] of wallets in the and the addresses but
[26:27] you cannot say this is the government of
[26:29] Russia you can't you can't tie it to
[26:32] them I don't think that's very easy yet
[26:35] I mean I would love to see um something
[26:37] what El Salvador did I think El salador
[26:40] just published their uh Holdings I mean
[26:43] you just know what they publish so you
[26:47] you know what they at least have they
[26:50] could have have more uh maybe there's
[26:52] also something going on in America where
[26:54] they publish an address where like ah
[26:56] here's our public Reserves of
[26:59] Bitcoin but you don't know if they stack
[27:01] twice as much in a secret wallet right
[27:04] right that's what I'm saying like it's
[27:07] very hard to be 100% sure I think you
[27:09] can you can be get close but it's never
[27:11] going to be
[27:13] 100% but and that's the whole whole
[27:15] point of the Bitcoin Game Theory I think
[27:17] that we're kind of seeing right now
[27:19] where uh we now have America talking
[27:23] about that and slowly implementing the
[27:26] the the changes towards that first Trump
[27:28] has to be elected then the bill has to
[27:30] pass and all the things slowly leading
[27:32] up to that uh but that that we already
[27:36] at that stage
[27:38] means all other countries are talking
[27:41] about adopting Bitcoin in some sense
[27:43] that there's no country that has no
[27:46] agency or no thing at all that says like
[27:49] like let's let's make a small task force
[27:51] for that uh because if Trump says
[27:54] something if the president of America is
[27:56] saying something the agencies around the
[27:59] world are talking about that exactly
[28:02] other people will scramble and you know
[28:05] put together a team to to discuss that
[28:08] as well when America starts discussing
[28:10] it so you know it's happening all over
[28:13] the world you know there's people paying
[28:15] attention and it's just a matter of time
[28:17] before before the moves are made and
[28:21] right now we have we all have a chance
[28:23] to front run all of that we're able to
[28:25] front run all the countries right now
[28:28] because no country is taking it
[28:30] seriously other than El Salvador Bhutan
[28:33] who mines I think some other people mine
[28:36] but but yeah it's not big amounts yet
[28:40] and even El Salvador is not taking it
[28:42] that seriously they they could buy so
[28:45] much more
[28:46] Bitcoin yeah they could I I think they
[28:49] could but I think they're buying to
[28:51] their capacity I I don't know the
[28:53] country's you know financial position
[28:56] but so I I'm not sure but I think I
[28:59] think it's still a good start and I
[29:00] think they still have a good lead on
[29:03] many of their neighboring countries in
[29:04] South America I heard once I don't know
[29:08] was it the GDP but there was like a
[29:09] number they compared it doing this it
[29:11] like around 4% they're buying with that
[29:14] I don't know if that was the GDP but
[29:16] something crazy happened in pdan I think
[29:18] buan is actually going way more
[29:21] ballistic way
[29:23] more um aggressive to bitcoin because
[29:26] they are F first of all way smaller
[29:28] country uh that one tenth of the size of
[29:31] El Salvador like really small they are
[29:33] smaller than Vienna the the city Vienna
[29:36] where I'm living in in Austria and
[29:38] Austria itself
[29:39] is okay yeah pan has not even a million
[29:43] people uh if if I remember correctly pan
[29:46] is very small let me quickly double
[29:49] check that uh but I am very certain
[29:52] about that um I will just share my
[29:56] screen so you also see that must have
[29:58] some sort of uh free energy source or
[30:02] something something that they have
[30:04] special there see they have 700,000
[30:08] people yeah it's probably not even a
[30:11] million today yeah and and uh and and
[30:15] just for size difference uh Vienna where
[30:18] I live has uh where where is
[30:23] it two million
[30:26] people and Vienna is within Austria and
[30:30] Austria is
[30:33] small yeah relative to other countries
[30:36] yeah absolutely a I mean then especially
[30:40] to to when you look at Germany Germany's
[30:43] 10 times bigger than uh than Austria uh
[30:48] and yeah America is
[30:51] um I think five times bigger or six
[30:55] times bigger than than than Germany
[30:58] something something along those lines if
[31:00] my math is not completely uh correct but
[31:04] it's uh that that's what I wanted to say
[31:06] Budan is really small uh in the global
[31:11] landscape of thing and they could
[31:13] definitely uh like they could not buy
[31:15] more they they're really high on on on
[31:18] their limits of buying Bitcoin uh I
[31:21] heard something like 70 75% of their GDP
[31:25] something along those lines they have
[31:29] Bitcoin which is
[31:31] crazy so speaking of Germany yeah they
[31:35] they sold all of their you know
[31:37] confiscated Bitcoin or whatever you want
[31:39] to call it they have nothing now and
[31:41] pric has doubled really quickly on them
[31:44] how do you see the the game theory
[31:46] playing like what will that change in
[31:47] the world with the game theory uh with
[31:50] Germany selling them Budan aggressively
[31:52] going in there I still like I said I
[31:54] think it's very early for game theory
[31:56] for Nations States I think there's a lot
[31:59] of time to front run each other and
[32:02] countries are probably going to position
[32:05] around it and I think it will take a
[32:08] long time as well I think 10 15 years it
[32:10] will take to really see something
[32:13] substantial as far as countries and
[32:15] Bitcoin goes and that's good for us we
[32:19] have 10 15 years to front run all over
[32:21] the world so I'm not worried about them
[32:25] rushing to buy Bitcoin I'm not worried
[32:27] about any country
[32:28] really Panic buying Bitcoin I don't see
[32:31] that happening I think they're going to
[32:33] talk about it I think they're going to
[32:35] keep saying it in the news but but until
[32:38] until you see somebody Panic buying like
[32:40] sailor at the country level I think
[32:43] there's nothing to worry about that
[32:44] could happen uh rather it could happen
[32:47] any day that's the thing what do you
[32:49] think happens at that in in in that
[32:53] month in that half year period
[32:56] because there's always this law of
[32:58] diminishing returns but at the same time
[33:01] I'm like we are just a few percent in
[33:03] the uh adoption and we have like a a lot
[33:08] lot of room to go and if now actually
[33:11] the country starts doing that that that
[33:13] could just go
[33:14] ballistic I think the law of diminishing
[33:17] returns has never been really applied to
[33:20] something with the finite
[33:22] amount I think the I think the math
[33:25] there is going to be interesting in the
[33:27] future
[33:28] because there's only 21 million and
[33:31] there's almost Infinity Fiat out there
[33:35] that that will chase it so what is going
[33:38] to be diminishing the the percent
[33:41] gain might be diminishing compared to 10
[33:44] years ago when you're going from one
[33:46] cent to
[33:47] $1 yeah maybe we're not going to have
[33:50] that but the percent gains will still be
[33:53] absolutely blistering yeah and and you
[33:56] wrote something interesting on Twitter I
[33:57] just pulled up uh you worry about why
[34:00] one gu buying isn't able to take
[34:03] Bitcoins above 100K I worry if I'll ever
[34:06] get to buy Bitcoin uh at 50k ever again
[34:11] uh that that's that's great I I think I
[34:13] like that mindset shift of like I want
[34:16] to get to as many Bitcoin as possible uh
[34:19] so I care about the price being
[34:22] cheap yeah I care about myself I I don't
[34:26] care about what Michael sailor is doing
[34:28] Michael sailor doesn't care about
[34:29] anybody else either he just wants as
[34:31] much Bitcoin as he can get cheaply but I
[34:35] saw this week on Twitter everyone is you
[34:38] know they're worried about why he's
[34:41] buying so much and we can't go over 100
[34:43] so I just I I thought that was a
[34:46] different like weird way to think about
[34:48] this everyone should be worried that
[34:50] they might never buy low price again
[34:53] that was my initial thought yeah you
[34:56] have that uh
[34:58] initials this inner struggle with you
[35:01] where you you're really happy when it
[35:04] goes up because oh like your your
[35:06] purchasing power goes up friends and
[35:08] family call you and you're not no longer
[35:11] the crazy guy and and you're like hey
[35:13] like oh you you actually called it it
[35:15] was right stuff like that uh but then
[35:17] you also have this like but I I'm I want
[35:21] to buy more especially if you're young I
[35:23] feel like if if you're now maybe uh
[35:27] above 50 60 70 no even even then it
[35:30] doesn't matter because the next 10 years
[35:32] will be crazy and you want to have as
[35:35] forget that that was that was wrong well
[35:38] especially if you're young for me it's
[35:41] like when when I'm now
[35:44] 26 I I I live very minimalistic right
[35:47] now and I don't want to have money at
[35:49] all like I I just want to have like my
[35:52] small rent paid uh some food uh here and
[35:56] there I go out with m girlfriend like
[35:58] small small stuff and all the rest of it
[36:02] to bitcoin because I want to have a good
[36:04] life and I'm 35 45 60 whatever uh so I
[36:09] really want the price to go
[36:11] down I know exactly for young people
[36:14] that's what you should want you should
[36:15] want to just save in this thing and you
[36:18] know go live your normal life and let it
[36:21] work for you over
[36:23] time then then I should uh announce that
[36:27] don't believe in Bitcoin anymore and
[36:29] make a podcast against it
[36:31] right that's right you should create fud
[36:34] so that you can get your price is is
[36:36] that the Peter shiff
[36:38] play Peter Schiff man I don't I don't
[36:40] know where to begin with that guy uh I
[36:44] think I think he's been wrong for so
[36:47] long that he cannot pivot now he he just
[36:51] publicly he cannot say that he was wrong
[36:54] and start accepting Bitcoin which is the
[36:57] opposite of uh trafi guys like Larry
[37:00] thinkink at Black Rock if you remember
[37:02] he was also talking bad about it for the
[37:05] longest time and then suddenly one day
[37:08] he turns around and says we like the ETF
[37:11] we I we like Bitcoin it's gonna be a
[37:13] world Reserve asset and then everybody
[37:16] forgot that he used to talk badly about
[37:19] it so somehow he was able to do it but
[37:22] Peter shiff cannot do it I think it
[37:25] would be an amazing move move of Peter
[37:28] shiff if he would do it I think he would
[37:32] be welcomed on every Bitcoin podcast I
[37:34] think he would be welcomed everywhere uh
[37:38] and I think he would even enhance his
[37:41] personal branding massively like 10x
[37:46] overnight uh if he really goes ballistic
[37:49] and says like oh I'm I'm selling all my
[37:52] gold and buying Bitcoin with it because
[37:55] he's just such a gold buck like he's so
[37:58] known for that and a switch like that
[38:02] that would be huge people would talk
[38:04] about that for very long that would stay
[38:08] in the feed on Twitter for weeks and
[38:11] weeks on end so I had the same exact
[38:14] thought I was telling my another friend
[38:16] here that Peter is the only person who
[38:19] can steal all of the news and he would
[38:22] have the biggest influence even bigger
[38:24] than Larry think even bigger than like
[38:27] Warren Buffett even if those guys
[38:29] switched if Peter switched he would beat
[38:32] them on engagement on views on uh
[38:36] everything influence everything
[38:38] especially because he has been already
[38:40] all on all the podcasts like he has been
[38:44] so many Bitcoin
[38:46] podcasts on the news on TV
[38:49] everywhere that would be that would be
[38:52] one hell of a move and and maybe he just
[38:54] announ like oh yeah like I I accumulated
[38:57] for the past three
[38:59] years he he would have the number one
[39:02] network effect for sure absolutely yeah
[39:05] would be fun to see um also something
[39:09] that I'm really glad we don't have to
[39:11] talk as much about uh as as in the
[39:14] beginning of the podcast is altcoins but
[39:16] I saw you you made us a really great um
[39:19] tweet also um about Al coins H how do
[39:22] you how do you see that sector right now
[39:27] do think so like maybe a precise
[39:31] question how long will they still live
[39:33] on I think they have their place in
[39:36] every single cycle because us humans are
[39:42] irrational beings and we love gambling
[39:46] and it's never going to die they're
[39:48] going to have their place in every cycle
[39:50] they're going to perform less and less
[39:53] and Bitcoin will keep climbing to new
[39:55] Highs but all the old ones will never
[39:57] make a new high and a lot of lessons are
[40:00] going to be learned every cycle and
[40:03] eventually they all come to bitcoin but
[40:06] every day there's new people born and
[40:08] they they're going to make mistakes and
[40:11] so I think the cycle keeps going and
[40:13] they're going to stay forever and it's
[40:14] also interesting how
[40:17] the uh Bitcoin dominance has been
[40:20] growing this year uh lately wait I will
[40:24] just quickly share it again yeah that's
[40:27] that's one metric that I don't actually
[40:29] follow but a lot of people talk about it
[40:31] every week and they show that it's going
[40:34] up every week but I I'm not sure how
[40:37] this is measured or what they're
[40:39] counting uh I I mean that's uh pretty
[40:44] there are a lot of out coins out there
[40:47] so it's it's not easy to track uh but
[40:50] they I think they get just everyone that
[40:52] is in coin market cap and uh see what is
[40:55] the whole market cap of
[40:57] Bitcoin and was the whole Market Cape of
[40:59] all cryptocurrencies minus
[41:03] Bitcoin yeah exactly uh but there's also
[41:08] um a real Bitcoin dominance where they
[41:13] do from the altcoin space the stable
[41:17] coins away because stable coins are not
[41:20] really altcoins they're just feared uh
[41:23] uh in in on on the blockchain feared on
[41:26] the blockchain so it's it's it's it's
[41:29] really like it shouldn't be even in the
[41:31] crypto category I feel like uh and then
[41:34] the the real dominance is like 70
[41:36] 80% uh especially if you look then
[41:39] Bitcoin compared to ethereum and some
[41:41] other examples you just see like they
[41:44] they all crash down against Bitcoin over
[41:46] the long run uh and it's just a matter
[41:48] yeah definitely but I wonder if they
[41:51] actually stay all the time there the
[41:53] Bitcoin dominance been has been at 60%
[41:56] with so so many tries and and so much
[41:58] gambling going on uh it's it's kind of
[42:01] amazing that we're still at those uh low
[42:04] levels of Bitcoin dominance I think we
[42:07] should have been already been like 8090
[42:09] 99% or something like that I agree that
[42:13] there will always be some gambling going
[42:15] on as like there's there's always some
[42:17] there's always noise to to to the signal
[42:21] uh but H 58% I think is is is just way
[42:25] too too low I I think that's because
[42:27] we're way too early that's it it's still
[42:31] too early we're only 15 years in and
[42:34] most of the altcoins are started after
[42:37] 2016 right with ethereum that's when I
[42:40] think ethereum came so the altcoins
[42:43] don't even have 10 years
[42:45] history so it it's still too early too
[42:48] early I think in another 10 years
[42:51] Bitcoin dominance 75% amazing I would
[42:55] love to see that perfect yeah uh I have
[42:58] one question that uh each and every one
[42:59] of my guests uh is getting um what can
[43:03] we learn from you besides Bitcoin ah
[43:05] besides Bitcoin I think uh I thought you
[43:09] were going to ask me what my question is
[43:11] for the next guest so I was prepared for
[43:13] that you threw me off here okay let's
[43:16] see yeah no no no no no worries take it
[43:19] take your time yeah it's it's uh I uh
[43:22] the the Andro te question for the for
[43:24] the next guest is coming then afterwards
[43:26] it's an interesting one I'm really
[43:28] looking forward to to hearing your
[43:29] answer yeah yeah no I like that you ask
[43:32] those questions to your guests uh so
[43:35] something about me I think so is it is
[43:36] it like a like a fact about me or or
[43:40] something personal um it is really
[43:44] interesting for me because there are two
[43:46] ways you can take this question to this
[43:49] the first thing is like something about
[43:51] you personally uh and the other thing is
[43:55] something um you have learned a skill u
[43:59] a quote like whatever uh that you uh
[44:02] want to talk about uh think so like
[44:06] there are three categories I think
[44:08] people usually answer that the first is
[44:10] like kind of the the family aspect oh uh
[44:13] there was one girl on there like oh you
[44:15] can learn from me how to be an amazing
[44:16] mother because I'm really obsessive with
[44:18] that topic being a mom uh there's other
[44:21] people that talk about instruments or
[44:24] Sports uh and then there's uh other
[44:27] people that have a really creative
[44:29] answer uh where they have something
[44:32] where I'm like oh wow that that could be
[44:34] a whole another podcast we could not
[44:36] talk about so it it really has no no
[44:40] real format there there there are so
[44:42] many different ways to answer that
[44:44] question maybe I have to reframe the
[44:46] question at some point because there are
[44:48] just like so many different ways It's
[44:51] seems to be not that clear what I want
[44:53] from that question no I think it's
[44:55] actually a great question it's this
[44:57] should be asked at every interview in my
[44:59] opinion but okay I'm going to try to
[45:02] answer it I think something about me is
[45:06] I'm a very very analytical person and
[45:08] I've always been like a mathematics
[45:11] related person ever since I was a kid so
[45:15] to me I mean Bitcoin came naturally when
[45:18] I when I figured it out and and uh I
[45:22] think I mean math runs the world
[45:25] basically if you get down to it and I
[45:28] guess I'm fortunate I to to embrace math
[45:32] and things like Bitcoin came naturally
[45:34] and things like the our Fiat Ponzi
[45:37] scheme I was able to understand because
[45:39] of math and it unlocks a lot of things
[45:43] in life if you have that uh fundamental
[45:46] you know basis so absolutely I think
[45:49] every math professor should understand
[45:51] Bitcoin but some some don't understand
[45:53] the monetary aspect of it but yeah Ma
[45:55] MAF should be they they are so Pro like
[45:58] all the why Bitcoin is secure that
[46:00] that's just math like if you look at the
[46:02] statistics like oh yeah like the math is
[46:04] clear no no one can ever manipulate that
[46:06] thing uh it's just like a math problem
[46:09] uh yeah so that that's great now to the
[46:11] end routine uh where the previous guest
[46:13] is asking a question for the next guest
[46:15] without knowing who the next guest
[46:16] actually is uh question is pre Preamble
[46:20] is four a human being has 4,000 weeks to
[46:24] live on
[46:25] average um
[46:28] that that's maybe a math problem you
[46:29] cannot figure out right now but how many
[46:31] weeks you got left and what are you
[46:34] doing with with those weeks okay how
[46:37] many we okay I think I have at
[46:42] least 1,500 weeks left okay and then
[46:47] what I'm I going to do with those
[46:49] weeks continue to just uh work for the
[46:52] next 10 years continue to stack Bitcoin
[46:55] and uh you know someday keep someday
[46:59] upgrade my life I don't I don't need
[47:01] much more than what I have now and I
[47:03] hope to pass it on to to my kids and
[47:07] whoever comes next and life should only
[47:10] get better on a Bitcoin standard and
[47:13] hopefully we see that globally someday
[47:16] whether it's 10 years 20 years but you
[47:19] know the the the the Fiat game can't go
[47:22] forever so I know some change is coming
[47:25] in the future and you you want to be on
[47:27] team Bitcoin to to to be on the winning
[47:30] team that's that's you are the
[47:33] impersonating um you're the figure of
