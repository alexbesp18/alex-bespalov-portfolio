[00:00] how many people understood Bitcoin and I
[00:02] think we are not more than or Circa in
[00:05] the magnitude of 100K no more it is
[00:09] 0.001 275% in the Bitcoin World there is
[00:13] so many romantic Utopia that cannot be
[00:16] true so an ETF is a path that we should
[00:18] go through in order to reach Bitcoin
[00:21] adoption Bitcoin has already won
[00:22] everyone who will join now will be
[00:24] mostly for number go up till the Bitcoin
[00:26] ETF in the financial World Bitcoin was
[00:28] seeing like sitting at the children
[00:29] table what happens when Apple encounters
[00:31] Bitcoin we should not trade Bitcoin
[00:33] because in the short term he does what
[00:35] he wants he wants and no one know we
[00:38] will assist at a kind of a Bitcoin Rush
[00:40] similar to the Gold Rush 150 years ago
[00:42] in California but it will be much more
[00:44] faster I have 100% 103% in Bitcoin right
[00:48] now I had 120% I'm working my way down
[00:51] my goal is 95% okay once you don't have
[00:54] any asset uh and you leave paycheck to
[00:56] paycheck you get hit by inflation
[00:58] completely because very like your
[01:00] paycheck didn't increase as much as
[01:03] [Music]
[01:06] inflation hiandra how are you doing my
[01:09] first ever podcast guest and he's the
[01:12] first one to return on the podcast uh
[01:14] welcome hi Robin thanks to have me here
[01:16] and also for me it's the first podcast
[01:18] the first episode I do in person all the
[01:20] other was online so great to see you and
[01:22] to meet you in person in prank yeah my
[01:24] my first ever in-person podcast was also
[01:26] like just two days ago it's it's
[01:28] definitely a way better feeling it like
[01:31] once you get used to it like you you
[01:32] really have a better connection remote
[01:34] it's just not the same thing and I love
[01:36] to do it uh in person and I would
[01:39] actually like to take that opportunity
[01:41] we recorded on I think 28th of November
[01:44] last year and I looked it up today the
[01:47] price went up 75% since then uh we had
[01:51] we had the ETF in between we had the
[01:53] Haring in between how was the time how
[01:55] did you see the the last half year for
[01:57] you yes it was a really exciting as so
[02:00] as you know I was a big advocator of
[02:02] Bitcoin ETF since October I started to
[02:05] focus on the importance of the ETFs and
[02:08] uh after a few weeks we saw the price
[02:10] going down there were many people saying
[02:12] uh okay it's a failure the ETF launch
[02:14] was not good it's not so important and
[02:17] then we saw Bitcoin going to 65 70k
[02:20] mostly due to the ETFs also breaking the
[02:23] previous cycle where uh the previous I
[02:26] was broken six months after the haling
[02:28] in this cycle was the first time that he
[02:30] was broken before the Hing so for me is
[02:33] uh is the start of the second era of
[02:35] Bitcoin the first era was started
[02:37] finished at the 9 of June of January
[02:40] 2024 and started the 3rd of January 2009
[02:43] and the second era started the 10 of
[02:45] January we saw only the Apex the CP of
[02:48] the iceberg the real Capital it's yet to
[02:51] come but is not coming in the next years
[02:54] I assume it's coming in the next uh next
[02:57] months from c 3 202 4 to Q2 2025 we will
[03:02] see the real effect that's interesting
[03:04] how how do you define those eras uh when
[03:07] you have like the first I don't know
[03:10] what was it 15 years it's like for you
[03:12] the first era uh do you have names for
[03:14] those
[03:16] eras maybe this is the let's say in I
[03:19] could call the institutional era uh also
[03:23] I have I started recently a podcast as
[03:25] Bitcoin as a store of value H because
[03:27] for me the biggest narrative The
[03:28] Narrative that matters the most is
[03:30] Bitcoin as a store of value especially
[03:33] for the people who are joining from now
[03:35] on and uh for having having the ETF is
[03:39] really important for the legitimacy of
[03:41] the asset we need uh Bitcoin doesn't
[03:45] need anyone but in order to have Global
[03:47] adoption for the common people we need
[03:49] the financial uh W in Bitcoin and
[03:52] recommending Bitcoin and they can join
[03:55] Bitcoin only with an ETF there are
[03:57] Pension funds institutions uh Insurance
[04:00] funds they will they cannot enter a
[04:02] Bitcoin world without an
[04:05] ETF is uh I I hear it a lot and and
[04:08] there's like always two sides to the
[04:09] stories and I I just love when Bitcoin
[04:11] gets adopt adopted like I don't care who
[04:14] adopts Bitcoin and I don't see anyone
[04:16] who is adopting Bitcoin as an enemy
[04:18] because I know Bitcoin is stable and
[04:21] resilient enough to uh ensure any attack
[04:24] so even if there's like an executive
[04:26] order 6 one or two uh what was with the
[04:30] gold thing uh I don't even if this comes
[04:33] Bitcoin will survive and thrive in the
[04:35] in the future maybe there are some
[04:36] short-term struggles with that and I
[04:38] don't think that that will happen uh but
[04:41] do do you see did you ever uh say like
[04:44] it could be a risk that uh so many
[04:46] Bitcoins are centralized at coinbase ah
[04:49] yes for sure there are also some
[04:52] drawbacks um yeah it could be a it could
[04:55] be a risk but I see also a low risk
[04:58] because um firstly there are not so many
[05:00] Bitcoins also they can have 500k or 1
[05:03] million Bitcoin and in total there are
[05:05] 20 million Bitcoin yeah and I see also
[05:08] as a phase so at the beginning maybe
[05:10] everyone would go to coinbase for
[05:12] example Fidelity Fidelity is now having
[05:14] self custody and maybe also they will
[05:17] choose other um other um exchange or
[05:21] other exchange for storing Bitcoin and
[05:24] also I think for coinbase there is no
[05:26] really there are also other technical
[05:27] risk of printing more Bitcoin or Fork
[05:31] people were saying uh uh Black Rock can
[05:34] Fork Bitcoin but in reality I think what
[05:37] Black Rock want to do is make money and
[05:40] there was a demand of a institution who
[05:43] wanted to be exposed on bitcoin uh and
[05:46] they could not so black rock created
[05:48] this service he's paying he's asking for
[05:51] a fee and people are happy to pay as fee
[05:53] that also this fee is like 0.3% per year
[05:56] so it's very low uh and uh asking money
[05:59] for fee so also the higher the price is
[06:03] is for Black Rock the better it is
[06:04] because they make more money in fees so
[06:06] I think there is a there could be some
[06:08] technical risk but the likelihood is
[06:10] very remote and they are not
[06:11] incentivized also which is the incentive
[06:14] of Blacklock to have more Bitcoin than
[06:16] what they declare or to uh sell more
[06:18] Bitcoin of what they have to have like
[06:20] paper Bitcoin they are very audited and
[06:23] they will not risk the reputation of 10
[06:26] trillion dollars
[06:28] for 100 billion maybe asset yeah and and
[06:32] I had the the podcast with Michael S he
[06:34] even made the argument that the ETF is
[06:37] the centralizing Bitcoin because it's
[06:39] another player in the game it's not only
[06:42] uh uh self custody people like it like
[06:45] there's another player now in the game
[06:47] and he talked about that like I think
[06:48] like 10 15 minutes about that point but
[06:52] uh that's an interesting uh
[06:54] comparison see it like that it's also
[06:56] for me the maybe the biggest thing is uh
[06:59] two one is the asset is legitimate for
[07:02] not for us we should we should be aware
[07:05] that we are in a bumble also people
[07:07] going to the conference people listening
[07:09] to podcast so far it's a small group of
[07:13] bitcoiners we are really convinced but
[07:14] we are in a small a small group compared
[07:16] to the global world and because most of
[07:19] the people they don't see as such a
[07:21] legitimate too much volatility still
[07:23] they were saying used by criminals and
[07:26] and so on and no in his value now we are
[07:28] seeing also with the ETF even the people
[07:31] remain against some so some move from
[07:33] against to in favor some from against to
[07:36] neutral but even the same people who are
[07:38] against they are they softened their
[07:41] opinion they are not say oh no Bitcoin
[07:42] is bad is used by criminals you you here
[07:46] much less now that is more legitimate so
[07:49] that's the first and second we should
[07:52] cope I think in the Bitcoin World there
[07:54] is so many romantic Utopia that cannot
[07:58] be true it will never happen that
[08:01] Bitcoin went spread because people use
[08:04] uh as a medium of Exchange in self
[08:06] custody how I see Bitcoin adoption will
[08:09] be first it will be store of value and
[08:11] to have the common people a store of
[08:13] value meaning the father of a family of
[08:15] two kids everyone storing 10 20 30% of
[08:20] their savings Bitcoin can happen only if
[08:22] the financial world is telling them that
[08:25] Bitcoin is a store of value and for the
[08:28] financial world to tell them they need
[08:31] an ETF so an ETF is
[08:35] um obliged like a a path that we should
[08:40] go through in order to reach Bitcoin
[08:42] adoption and I will not see the common
[08:46] person if we go now in prago in any City
[08:48] and we ask the people to store 10 20 30%
[08:51] they will think if it is US recommending
[08:54] they will say no you're like or you're
[08:55] crazy you're you're like Risk even if
[08:57] it's the opposite it will happen when
[08:59] the financial world will tell okay 10%
[09:02] 20% in Bitcoin is in a is a a standard
[09:06] position in a balanced portfolio and uh
[09:09] you also chose the name for your podcast
[09:11] uh that is on X spaces live and also
[09:13] then on YouTube uh uh the recording um
[09:17] which is really cool Al the the format
[09:19] that you doing it I never saw it like
[09:21] that Live recorded on Twitter spaces and
[09:23] then uh like I really love that you
[09:25] brought something new into the space um
[09:28] but you chose the name Bitcoin as a
[09:29] store of value yes uh and we have those
[09:32] Cycles like first the Bitcoin was just
[09:34] like collector item some nerds uh bought
[09:37] it so it was like getting bigger and
[09:40] bigger adopted and now we're in the I
[09:43] guess longest and biggest phase of the
[09:45] allall is the store value phase but once
[09:49] everyone adopts it as their financial
[09:51] energy I have 100% three% in Bitcoin
[09:55] right now so risky I I 120% I'm working
[10:01] my way down my goal is 95% okay but but
[10:05] I don't want to sell Bitcoin so I have
[10:07] to stack up okay okay yes you have to
[10:10] get cash till when you reach 9 I have I
[10:13] have to get rid of my credits and
[10:14] everything we get to the 95% uh it's I
[10:18] have a long time in Horizon I have no no
[10:20] no rush for that and there's no risk for
[10:23] for for me in that uh because even if
[10:25] the price of Bitcoin goes to zero I'm
[10:27] I'm I'm fine with that um but the the
[10:30] way I wanted to go is like when
[10:32] everybody adopts the M main store of
[10:35] value they're like 80% in Bitcoin 90% in
[10:38] Bitcoin even 50% in Bitcoin they might
[10:40] want to spend it at some point Def and
[10:44] it's then the next step and the next
[10:47] error uh the the meim of exchange error
[10:50] would you rename also your
[10:52] podcast firstly I think uh definitely
[10:55] Bitcoin has all the potential to become
[10:57] a global medium change
[10:59] and um it will be the main narrative but
[11:02] I think from a 202 32 35 not earlier we
[11:06] will need some years before people move
[11:08] now there will be a consensus of 1 3%
[11:12] because we should not forget 2022 we had
[11:15] celsus blockfi FTX Bitcoin unfortunately
[11:19] crypto World harming once again Bitcoin
[11:22] but Bitcoin Is Res resilient so he
[11:24] survived brilliantly but still in 2022
[11:28] two years ago I think also you any
[11:30] bitcoiners we almost sto to discuss
[11:33] Bitcoin no one was asking about Bitcoin
[11:35] because regardless what we said he moved
[11:38] from 69 to 17K so our um um potential to
[11:43] educate on bitcoin was quite low then
[11:46] Bitcoin came up he moved to 20 25,000
[11:50] there was also the big cases of some
[11:53] banks in California who were went
[11:55] bankrupt and Bitcoin moved as a store of
[11:58] value and then it was the ETF so now is
[12:02] people are seeing once again as a store
[12:04] of value for me on uh store of value
[12:09] Bitcoin has already won as we many bit I
[12:11] hear also in podcast for many who we
[12:14] invite in the podcast there is no debate
[12:16] in fact that's why I'm not um willing to
[12:20] discuss or to debate on bitcoin as a
[12:22] store of value with people who read
[12:24] maybe two articles and they're skeptical
[12:26] on Bitcoins no firstly they need to
[12:28] study they need to spend a lot of hours
[12:30] and then we can discuss about Bitcoin
[12:31] but also there is no alignment on if it
[12:34] is not a good or bad store of value he
[12:37] already won and we are waiting the world
[12:40] to uh realize it for medium exchange yes
[12:43] for the monetization of the asset once
[12:45] you reach the global store of value he
[12:47] has a bigger a very good chance to
[12:49] become Global medium of exchange I am
[12:52] not as sure that he will become the
[12:54] global medium of exchange if I have to
[12:56] bet I would say yes also because
[12:58] considering microeconomics we can
[13:00] discuss maybe later on uh they will
[13:03] print money they will keep printing
[13:05] money because it's the only way to keep
[13:07] the system running so at one point I
[13:10] assume the dollars will have such high
[13:12] inflation that people start to discuss
[13:14] start to say okay with um 8 10 12 15%
[13:19] you cannot cope many years with 12 15%
[13:22] inflation because the Low Middle low
[13:25] class will be completely wrecked so once
[13:28] you reach start store of value he can be
[13:30] he has the potential to become a medium
[13:32] of exchange but we will know more once
[13:35] he reach store of value maybe I will
[13:37] change my at that point when it's
[13:39] everyone has a fif uh maybe 80 is a bit
[13:42] too extreme for us but even 30% 50% in
[13:46] Bitcoin imagine the common people having
[13:48] 30% in Savings in Bitcoin will be a huge
[13:51] win for all and you also mentioned that
[13:53] in our first podcast that you have to
[13:56] spend was it 100 hours or hours I yes I
[14:01] know one okay 1,000 I think is only for
[14:03] for us for people who are really
[14:04] interested um I say 100 hours for a good
[14:08] basic understanding but uh personally I
[14:10] would say I will not debate on bitcoin
[14:12] as sort of value with whoever didn't
[14:15] spend less I didn't spend at least 250
[14:17] hours on bitcoin because I not willing
[14:20] to waste time to explain all the
[14:22] misconception there are in Bitcoin is
[14:24] hard also one error that we are doing
[14:27] that is easy to understand it's not easy
[14:29] to understand you need maybe easy maybe
[14:32] to grasp especially the the current
[14:34] situation you see that with higher
[14:36] inflation people are grasping but to
[14:38] really to understand Bitcoin it takes
[14:40] time each of us took maybe years or
[14:44] months but generally years many hundred
[14:46] of hours many hours or hundreds in order
[14:49] to reach this position now we are we say
[14:52] okay it it it works it's clear the store
[14:55] of value but we should not forget how
[14:57] much time we spend
[14:59] in order to understand this H so I
[15:02] always say we can bring you they say you
[15:06] can bring the horse to the water but you
[15:08] cannot make him drink so also Michael
[15:10] Tor said we cannot make people think but
[15:14] we can make people think about something
[15:16] so we can make people um thinking about
[15:19] the economy what is wrong with inflation
[15:23] what is scar importance of scarcity the
[15:25] history of money but then they should
[15:27] spend time at home alone and study and
[15:31] this is what most majority of people are
[15:33] not doing really they ever like I think
[15:37] that most people will never really
[15:39] understand Bitcoin it's just a really
[15:40] small minority uh and the rest will just
[15:44] buy it because it's so obvious
[15:46] definitely is one so Satoshi Nakamoto
[15:50] say it's bloody hard to explain Bitcoin
[15:53] because it's nothing related to it and
[15:55] every time when there is something new
[15:57] most of the people are not able to get
[15:59] because our human brain brain is really
[16:01] good in having incremental um
[16:04] improvements that's why also people in
[16:06] finance are not getting Bitcoin they are
[16:07] very great in maybe they are very expert
[16:10] on the financial world bond stock uh
[16:13] real estate and for incremental uh uh
[16:17] improvements they are the best to grasp
[16:19] it but when it is a disrupted technology
[16:21] a completely different technology it's
[16:23] very it's even harder for those who live
[16:25] in that world and uh I think the biggest
[16:29] comp the most suitable comparison is
[16:31] with the internet in the '90s only few
[16:34] people understood the internet and there
[16:36] were the people who really studying the
[16:38] internet now if we go around here the
[16:40] conference and we ask which is the
[16:42] biggest innovation of the last 30 years
[16:44] everyone will say or most everyone
[16:46] internet without even knowing so in 20
[16:49] years our children when our children
[16:51] will Bebe 20 25 20 years old our future
[16:54] children um at that time we ask which is
[16:58] the biggest innovation of the last 30
[17:00] years people will reply Bitcoin without
[17:02] knowing how it works also because I
[17:05] really it's not that I am an expert on
[17:07] internet use every day but uh I know the
[17:10] value but I don't know it works the
[17:12] difference is to be an early adopter you
[17:14] should understand it h if you want to be
[17:16] a low uh to to adopt once everyone is
[17:20] adopting it uh then uh it will be there
[17:23] will be no Advantage not a big Advantage
[17:26] anymore so they many people will buy
[17:29] when it's safe when the financial world
[17:31] will say yes go 20% in Bitcoin there
[17:34] will be much less risk or at least the
[17:37] perceived risk because the real risk in
[17:39] Bitcoin I assume is quite low the only
[17:42] problem is the price will be maybe 1
[17:44] million so and they miss the the big bu
[17:47] run is uh how do you see uh self custody
[17:51] in that because for me it's really that
[17:53] two sides in me uh the one side is
[17:56] saying oh no uh Bitcoin will only be be
[17:59] self- custody for a really small portion
[18:01] of people then there's also the the
[18:03] thing where when you have Bitcoin self
[18:06] custody the transaction fees will be
[18:07] really expensive uh and uh and we I
[18:11] talked with many people around about
[18:13] that concept yesterday like uh now uh
[18:17] maybe what's the average uh transaction
[18:20] on on the base layer of Bitcoin I don't
[18:23] know maybe 20 EUR maybe 100 EUR maybe uh
[18:27] uh, Eur but in in 10 years it will be
[18:31] 10x 100x uh 20x of that uh in in in Euro
[18:36] terms maybe like zi terms will be
[18:39] interesting how it it goes from there uh
[18:41] but not everyone will be even able to
[18:44] transact on a base layer because it will
[18:47] be uh bloody hard and really yes it also
[18:51] will take time because seven transaction
[18:54] per second or and and and it's just like
[18:56] uh it will be expensive yeah yes
[18:59] uh that that that's the the main thing
[19:01] how do you see uh a world and then oh
[19:04] that's what I was saying uh then there's
[19:05] the other side to it where I'm like okay
[19:07] but how many like when we started in the
[19:10] beginning of the email thing everyone
[19:12] was saying like everyone has to run his
[19:14] own email server everyone will have his
[19:16] own email server but now everyone has
[19:18] like Gmail and and those centralized uh
[19:21] things do you think that will be like
[19:23] similar that with with the internet
[19:26] adoption where we centralize a lot uh
[19:29] and only hardcore Freedom loving
[19:33] bitcoiners on the self custody level uh
[19:36] on on bitcoin maybe on a second layers
[19:37] of custody and
[19:40] 99% or
[19:41] 99.9% are on on like just on Exchange or
[19:44] something like maybe less than 99% but
[19:47] for sure the vast majority so I think
[19:49] also self important that Bitcoin has the
[19:52] option of self custody and whoever wants
[19:53] to do self custody can do uh for me also
[19:57] I have my I don't uh my diversification
[20:00] is not on the stocks bonds uh it's only
[20:03] Bitcoin but I also diversify in Bitcoin
[20:06] so I have also some in self custody and
[20:09] a portion also in custody it's like my
[20:13] uh I don't want to have all risk in one
[20:15] so better to diversify what I see in the
[20:17] future firstly the class from 2024 is
[20:20] completely different from the class of
[20:22] 2013 15 everyone who had very great
[20:25] great sensibility on Cyber Punk freedom
[20:29] sovereign individual is already in
[20:30] Bitcoin so everyone who will join now
[20:32] will be mostly for number go up and many
[20:36] of them will not want to learn self
[20:38] custody because it's also in the panel
[20:40] yesterday self- custody versus ETF they
[20:42] were saying uh self custody is simple
[20:45] but then you have to have the
[20:45] responsibility you you need to be
[20:47] responsible and not everyone want to be
[20:50] responsible of of their money what I see
[20:53] in the future maybe not only the Cyber
[20:55] fun people really for self custody they
[20:58] will be them plus some more because once
[21:01] Bitcoin is medium of exchange and it
[21:03] will be more spread then also for
[21:07] Austrian School of Economics when there
[21:08] will be more demand more demand then
[21:10] also technology will advance more so
[21:12] there will be easier self- custody
[21:14] solution so there will be more people
[21:17] but still the vast majority will use um
[21:20] um custodial I will call Bitcoin banks
[21:24] that are kind of institution that at the
[21:26] moment don't exist yet what in also half
[21:30] were say no we will need Bitcoin Banks
[21:31] because it cannot be that everyone will
[21:34] self cast they will have no k no kyc
[21:36] transaction but I see this institution
[21:40] bet way better than Banks firstly they
[21:42] will not be fractional Reserve banking
[21:44] because Bitcoin you cannot print more
[21:47] and uh secondly they should give loan
[21:50] credit loan only if Savers block this
[21:53] Bitcoin in their bank so the whole
[21:57] Bitcoin will give the incentives to the
[21:59] bank to behave more um in a way to have
[22:04] hard money so the whole system uh will
[22:07] improve and the biggest I think the
[22:09] biggest uh change of Bitcoin H will not
[22:12] be that uh some people will have Bitcoin
[22:15] in self cust this is also a change but
[22:17] the biggest will be the to put the whole
[22:19] monetary system in a Bitcoin standard
[22:22] without fractional Reserve Banking and
[22:24] with the loans backed by Saving this is
[22:28] the most important things uh if we have
[22:30] this then our economy and our
[22:32] civilization will
[22:34] Thrive amazing and uh when we come to to
[22:38] to hard ball it's like even now
[22:40] yesterday M Sak the treasure CEO made a
[22:43] presentation uh and he brought up one
[22:45] statistics that I was completely shocked
[22:48] okay interesting uh he said only two% of
[22:53] bitcoiners right now are having self
[22:55] cust the hard wallet okay yeah and I'm
[22:58] like
[22:59] 2% right now now okay the future okay
[23:02] yes and I'm like imagine the future it
[23:05] does this get better with better
[23:06] technology and it's easier to use and
[23:08] maybe like self- custody uh um um saor
[23:12] talked about on the podcast a little bit
[23:13] like he's like what happens when Apple
[23:15] encounters Bitcoin and then they're
[23:17] thinking like oh I could I I want my
[23:20] users to self custody their Bitcoin I
[23:23] want them to have selfcast devices multi
[23:25] signature devices on my on there are
[23:28] Apple devices there's an Apple Watch
[23:31] there's an iPad there's an MacBook uh
[23:33] there's an iPhone there are like four
[23:35] devices most Apple users have more than
[23:37] one Apple device I see I have four and
[23:40] you have four devices you could have
[23:41] made a four multi signature wallet with
[23:44] your Apple devices so like why why not
[23:46] do do do that and and maybe maybe that's
[23:49] the future where we're like we just have
[23:51] like oh let's let's bring uh the Apple
[23:53] watch has to touch the iPhone and then
[23:55] you lock your your Bitcoin something
[23:56] like that okay oh yes
[23:59] that could be could be an option
[24:00] interesting this uh percentage of 2%
[24:03] yeah but I think also which people are
[24:06] saying how many address they are in uh
[24:08] in the Bitcoin and uh on this site I
[24:12] don't think we need to only judge how
[24:13] many addresses we have in in Bitcoin to
[24:16] judge the adoption because if a person
[24:18] in the west world has $100 in 100 EUR or
[24:21] dollars in Bitcoin is not really in the
[24:23] Bitcoin world yes he has some Bitcoin
[24:26] and I think for adoption uh Al so
[24:28] discuss with croisus once you're having
[24:31] like 5% of your savings in Bitcoin or
[24:35] maybe let's say in the west word 10K
[24:38] 10,000 H then is like when uh you can
[24:42] you can incorporate this person in
[24:44] Bitcoin adoption because uh many I am
[24:46] sure many they heard maybe in a in a
[24:50] meeting with friends or in a wedding
[24:53] from someone and then they open an
[24:55] account and they have $50 50 EUR and
[24:57] they don't touch anymore I don't really
[24:59] consider this as a Bitcoin
[25:02] adoption oh so like even if it's really
[25:05] like because it's like really
[25:06] interesting to like how many bitcoiners
[25:07] are there yes it's an impossible thing
[25:10] to answer because there are address
[25:12] Bitcoin addresses where million users
[25:14] are on there because it's like an
[25:15] exchange or something like that and then
[25:17] there are uh users they are not on an
[25:21] exchange but they have like 10 or 20 or
[25:23] 50 addresses for for their Bitcoin uh
[25:26] what's your best guess how many
[25:27] bitcoiners are we
[25:29] in the world in the
[25:31] world and maybe so assuming five 5% for
[25:36] allocation maybe 5% or 10K H maybe 1
[25:40] million in the world one and but uh I
[25:44] more Curious of how many people
[25:45] understood Bitcoin and uh I think we are
[25:49] not more than or Circa in the magnitude
[25:52] of 100K no more it is
[25:56] 0.1 275% same of people who can really
[26:00] discuss like we are discussing as
[26:02] civilization future of society um hard
[26:06] hard money scarcity people who can
[26:09] discuss this level I don't think we are
[26:11] more than 100K and we discussed that in
[26:13] the our first podcast and I brought it I
[26:15] don't know if I brought it up after the
[26:16] recording or we brought it up actually
[26:18] in the recording I have a list on
[26:21] Twitter with bitcoiners and I collect
[26:25] them like I when I see a bitcoiner I
[26:27] just add them uh and I have uh now a
[26:31] little bit more than there I think back
[26:33] then I had like 150 people yes and now I
[26:36] have like two 300 in there so I got to
[26:38] know more people more people came into
[26:40] the Bitcoin space uh but I'm like I'm
[26:43] pretty know a lot of people I I really
[26:46] search through uh Twitter and see like
[26:48] oh who's in there and I put them in like
[26:50] I really search hard I'm not probably
[26:53] higher than that I don't get everyone
[26:55] but I think I have a good good like
[26:58] actual Bitcoin like no crypto people
[27:01] there like web free in their in their bu
[27:03] I don't add them NS I don't add them but
[27:06] it's not a lot of people and uh which is
[27:08] your uh threshold how many followers I I
[27:12] I eliminated the threshold down so I
[27:15] have now like 10,000 followers and down
[27:18] because even people with a th000
[27:21] followers or 300 followers uh even them
[27:24] have nice tweets and they might have uh
[27:27] Futures like before I have the threshold
[27:29] of 3,000 followers yes yeah makes sense
[27:31] like under uh 10,000 followers I have
[27:34] like
[27:35] 15600 like you mean above above 10,000
[27:38] no under 10,000 under 10,000 followers I
[27:42] have like 150 people in there okay and
[27:44] then the rest 150 people are oh yes I
[27:47] also have 150 people that okay okay so
[27:49] like 10 uh 10,000 so like the the medium
[27:52] I I guess there uh or like the medium is
[27:55] probably way way lower than that I don't
[27:57] know like the I never calculated good uh
[28:00] first good we are not that many in
[28:03] Twitter but also we all start there I
[28:05] also now I have uh 18K followers after a
[28:09] lot of tweets uh same for you by the way
[28:12] congratulations to your success I mean I
[28:14] know you had like first podcast you were
[28:16] on was like 5,000 around that uh
[28:19] follower Mark you were right when we had
[28:21] when we had yes yeah in the last I think
[28:23] with the ETF I I made my my point and I
[28:27] di di on uh on I think also one
[28:30] recommendation I do I say and I follow
[28:33] this advice Bitcoin is very
[28:35] multidisciplinary so for example I don't
[28:37] discuss about how to selfcast the
[28:39] Bitcoin because I'm not an expert I
[28:41] don't discuss about Bitcoin as a medium
[28:42] of change what I like the most is store
[28:44] of value for me the ETF was really um a
[28:48] big change a new era and so I focus on
[28:51] that and I provide a lot of content on
[28:53] this at a high level because I was
[28:55] following every day all the flaws what
[28:58] people were saying in Twitter how
[28:59] following with the price the
[29:01] relationship between Financial world and
[29:04] and uh people appreciate that I provide
[29:07] some special com content so the advice
[29:09] is fire your Niche your the area where
[29:12] you like the most and and focus on that
[29:14] area if you want to grow your followers
[29:17] definitely there are many valuable
[29:18] people who have a lot of knowledge on
[29:21] bitcoin and they have only they have not
[29:23] only they have few hundreds of um
[29:25] followers and if they find as spot where
[29:28] they provide unique content then uh the
[29:31] the followers will Thrive also because
[29:34] as I said before in the next month the
[29:36] price will go up and number number go up
[29:39] technology is the number one way to have
[29:42] more followers in fact also I can see
[29:44] also in my followers when Bitcoin is
[29:46] going it was going from 40K to 60k my
[29:49] followers increase much away faster way
[29:53] than in the last three months in the
[29:55] last three months the price remain more
[29:56] or less stable but it's it's like it
[29:58] feels like 200 years we are between 66
[30:01] and 72 and they didn't get so many more
[30:04] new followers despite posting uh
[30:07] regularly yeah definitely I I talked
[30:09] with the uh Bitcoin exchange CEOs I
[30:12] talked with uh the treasure CEO
[30:15] yesterday IAL with uh other content
[30:17] creators and everyone is saying the same
[30:19] thing yes when the price go
[30:22] sideways sales go down same yes when the
[30:25] price goes down or up like it doesn't
[30:27] matter the just has to do
[30:30] something then then the actual uh
[30:33] Bitcoin price goes up that that's no no
[30:36] no the actual like sales numbers of of
[30:38] Treasure of of Bitcoin only companies
[30:41] like 21 Bitcoin or something like that
[30:42] they go actually up and do that because
[30:44] of that and it's just the same with uh
[30:47] with with us content creators because
[30:49] when the pr does something people are
[30:51] like oh what what is that about and they
[30:53] they are searching on YouTube Bitcoin
[30:55] they more on Twitter yes and many they
[30:57] theyard you they hear they he your
[30:59] podcast they know I think many they're
[31:01] in the sideline but uh also the price
[31:05] improve is not the price increases not
[31:07] only move people from not listening to
[31:09] listening but many from not paying
[31:11] attention to PID sideline attention once
[31:14] Bitcoin many maybe they already know
[31:16] your podcast but they're not listening
[31:18] yet once Bitcoin is 80 90k they will
[31:20] think oh I saw robiner podcast let me
[31:23] listen to it so they're like they pay
[31:25] they don't pay active attention but they
[31:27] they they know you and they will listen
[31:29] to you when Bitcoin will be higher hey
[31:33] one small note that I want to do for for
[31:35] the list on on on Twitter that I have is
[31:37] I only see English people like there
[31:41] like there are way more bitcoiners that
[31:43] maybe only do Spanish content or maybe
[31:45] only do French content they are not in
[31:47] my list this just a Nuance that I want
[31:49] to give to the list it's it's not like
[31:52] there are only 300 bitcoiners on all
[31:56] that there is they probably like
[31:58] probably like way more than that that I
[31:59] don't even have on my radar than there
[32:01] are people that talk about Bitcoin but
[32:03] are not really in the Bitcoin scene and
[32:05] then there are all the other languages
[32:08] because English is just 10% of the world
[32:11] yes but in Bitcoin um most of the
[32:14] literature on bitcoin is uh is in
[32:16] English yeah is in English in fact when
[32:17] I say I speak also I I have also some
[32:20] articles and some uh videos in Italian
[32:22] for the Italian communities on Austrian
[32:24] School of Economics but uh considering
[32:27] also that generally the people who are
[32:29] interested in Bitcoin are or genz or
[32:32] Millennials uh they should make the
[32:34] effort wherever they're coming from we
[32:35] coming from the first world if they want
[32:38] they can learn an English enough to
[32:40] learn to listen to a podcast or to read
[32:42] a book they don't have to work in
[32:44] English or to live in English so it will
[32:47] be it would be great for them if they
[32:49] can also learn English because uh what
[32:53] it is offered in German or in Italian or
[32:55] in Spanish it's maybe 5% of the
[32:59] literature of what is offered in English
[33:02] also for Austrian School of Economics
[33:04] there are several books the price of
[33:07] time
[33:09] um another is uh the ethics of money
[33:12] production plus other books I cannot
[33:15] recommend this to the local community
[33:17] because they are only in English and um
[33:21] so we on one side yes we need Educators
[33:24] to uh spread in the local language but
[33:28] whoever is interested in new technology
[33:30] new thing the original language is in
[33:33] English then if something is well
[33:35] established since years then there will
[33:37] be translation in every language uh but
[33:40] for everything that is new also the
[33:42] internet when was New it was mostly in
[33:44] English because it's the lingua franka
[33:46] of our world yeah it's really
[33:49] interesting I actually made the decision
[33:51] like because I I'm natively German
[33:53] German yes uh but my girlfriend only
[33:56] speaks English with me I speak now with
[33:58] all the guests English like 90% of my
[34:00] life is actually now English uh it's
[34:02] sometimes even weird for me to speak in
[34:04] German it's like it turned completely
[34:06] the other way around uh and same for me
[34:09] in Italian sometimes Al some words
[34:11] sounds weird in Italian if you translate
[34:13] so I keep the word in English yes
[34:16] definitely and and I made the specific
[34:19] choice to do it in English uh and there
[34:22] was one aspect of it because the German
[34:25] Bitcoin Community is really strong
[34:28] there are so many great Bitcoin
[34:31] podcasters uh from the starting point
[34:33] with niik Y but there are so
[34:37] many they're making it possible that
[34:40] that we uh record here like the the
[34:42] German speaking Community is really
[34:45] strong uh and then we also have the
[34:47] content graders like Roman re with block
[34:49] trainer we have Sun decree we have other
[34:52] big people and I just looked at the
[34:53] German market and the English market and
[34:55] I was like they are in both markets
[34:57] really strong people in there so I don't
[35:00] have to fill a hole okay yes I can just
[35:02] freely choose what whatever I want to do
[35:05] and uh because uh if for example if
[35:08] there was almost no Bitcoin podcast in
[35:09] German and there was no good content
[35:11] grade in German I would definitely do it
[35:12] in German because then I can provide
[35:15] real value to a really huge community of
[35:19] people but as it is there are so many
[35:22] great uh people I don't have to be
[35:24] another great person though I can be
[35:26] another great person also in English
[35:27] it's it's it's okay for me in English
[35:30] also you have the chance to interview
[35:32] many more uh bitcoiners in your podcast
[35:35] if you are listening to this podcast you
[35:37] might be wondering what is actually the
[35:39] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[35:42] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[35:44] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[35:46] right source and you have to store
[35:48] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[35:50] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[35:52] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[35:55] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[35:57] don't don't deal with an exchange that
[35:58] has an own token or something like that
[36:01] be on a Bitcoin only exchange I use 21
[36:04] Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is for me the best
[36:07] partner for that and now where do you
[36:09] store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored
[36:11] on a hardware wallet on a self custody
[36:15] solution where you yourself hold your
[36:17] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[36:21] that's my Simple Solutions that's a bit
[36:24] box you just put your Bitcoin on there
[36:26] back up your seat fres is and you are
[36:28] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[36:32] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[36:35] it's a absolutely must have yes way more
[36:39] uh
[36:41] uh maybe not even more because there are
[36:43] enough people in German that I can
[36:46] interview a lot but U different kind of
[36:49] people yes and yeah like even an Italian
[36:51] looks different at Bitcoin than at
[36:53] German uh and uh and in Indian
[36:57] definitely looks looks different at
[36:58] Bitcoin than than a than a German and an
[37:01] American looks different that like it's
[37:02] it's just interesting to have all around
[37:04] the world this this this Global thing
[37:06] but let's get uh back to topic like it's
[37:08] actually I've not been I've not come to
[37:11] my second question till now okay and we
[37:13] are here
[37:15] help I I love it um for the ETFs uh a
[37:19] lot of people uh I
[37:21] think 30 32 minutes for one face that's
[37:25] Bitcoin
[37:28] um uh for the ETF the actually question
[37:30] that I had is um we had like Samson ma
[37:33] coming out and he said like if if the
[37:35] bitf comes and it goes great I think he
[37:38] said like it can go like in a few weeks
[37:40] really high I don't remember the the
[37:42] exact number that he said I think one
[37:44] million one million he's like wow that
[37:46] that was really crazy um and there are a
[37:49] lot of other people that said like when
[37:50] Once the Bitcoin off hits like we have
[37:52] this huge optic then we had like
[37:55] several instances before the actual
[37:58] launch with the hack and everything
[38:00] involved in that and it would be
[38:01] interesting also to hear your
[38:02] perspective on the on the launch of the
[38:04] Bitcoin ETF also uh but are you
[38:06] disappointed with the bitf till now no
[38:09] with now so I was till March April was
[38:14] like on track because it was already
[38:16] 70k and now maybe in the I would not
[38:19] have expected to range so long in this
[38:21] 65 70k for the last uh 3 months but uh
[38:25] the the best will still come so I'm the
[38:28] shift is there the Big Chain so Bitcoin
[38:31] moved from uh like in a Christmas T in a
[38:34] Christmas evening there is a table for
[38:36] the olders for the older people and and
[38:38] a table for the children till till the
[38:41] Bitcoin ETF in the financial World
[38:42] Bitcoin was see see like sitting at a
[38:44] children table meaning something
[38:46] different now every financial adviser
[38:49] has to cope with another financial
[38:51] advisor who has a performance with
[38:53] Bitcoin because it's an ETF is a product
[38:55] the same so they in the the financial
[38:57] world is the same as any other asset or
[39:00] is becoming the same maybe one thing on
[39:03] the launch it was very hilarious and
[39:06] stange yeah will never respect because
[39:09] few weeks before uh the launch the sex
[39:12] said that don't trust anyone else just
[39:15] track the SE Twitter account and then it
[39:18] was the Twitter that was hacked it was
[39:20] like oh what and and we even had like
[39:23] two dry runs of a bit lunch there was
[39:25] like this months before like one month
[39:28] before where we had the uh it was a coin
[39:31] dasas or some that you said yeah it was
[39:33] some really like a major brand who would
[39:38] have been trusted actually and they're
[39:39] like
[39:41] bitco and and we saw an immediate three
[39:44] yeah yes from 27 to 30k then it was like
[39:47] a fake and then he went down yeah and
[39:49] then the next dry around with the day
[39:52] before the actual launch with the the
[39:54] hack we had another like huge uptick of
[39:57] the sudden but then when it actually
[39:59] launched it it was so weird it was like
[40:02] not that one event now it's launched
[40:04] it's like it got like is it now launched
[40:06] or how do you how did they see that yeah
[40:08] it was strange I would not have respect
[40:10] there's also another another reason why
[40:12] you shouldn't we should not trade
[40:14] Bitcoin because in the short term he
[40:16] does what he wants he wants and no one
[40:18] knows so there was he started the year a
[40:22] 42.3k and then prior to the lunch you
[40:24] reach 48k so most of these uh 15% 20 uh
[40:29] 15 17% increase was due to the
[40:32] expectation so once it was launched also
[40:34] he stayed stable and then he went down
[40:37] we went to 38k in the next 3 weeks
[40:40] that's why every Bitcoin
[40:42] skeptical or the the tractor will say
[40:45] the lunch was a fail or it doesn't
[40:46] matter he's dead once again is dead and
[40:50] one of the reason is because I think
[40:52] already was priced in before and uh at
[40:56] one point it was 99 9.90% 9% sure and
[41:00] secondly because uh this gbtc had 6
[41:03] 600,000 Bitcoin and decide to keep the
[41:05] fee very high
[41:07] 1.5% and uh that that's why they start
[41:10] to sell even more Bitcoin than when they
[41:12] other were acquiring and on gptc was
[41:16] kind of controversial because it's also
[41:18] thanks to gptc that we have the Bitcoin
[41:20] ETF because they they put they went to
[41:23] court against the SE and also when they
[41:26] won this cuse is when um Eric balunas
[41:29] and James saer increase their um
[41:32] likelihood from 50 to 90% because also
[41:35] not only they win in a court but the SE
[41:37] didn't appeal so they kind of said okay
[41:41] then we will have to do an
[41:43] ETF so yeah the first three weeks was
[41:45] was weird when he was down but then he
[41:47] started then we started gptc going a bit
[41:50] lower and the what was surprising was
[41:53] the flow keep coming after three four or
[41:55] five weeks Eric baluna probably is one
[41:58] the biggest expert of the world in ETF
[42:00] he was asked uh how you eval after one
[42:03] and a half months how you evaluate
[42:05] Bitcoin uh spot ETF launch from 1 to 10
[42:08] and he said
[42:10] 10 of these 10 nine because of was of
[42:13] the lunch but it was the 10 because
[42:15] after three four five weeks the the flow
[42:17] was still coming high and that's why we
[42:21] saw from 40 to 73k we had 73k in early
[42:26] March and we were all pumped okay we go
[42:28] to 80k maybe 100K before the haling and
[42:32] so and now it's ranging uh since some
[42:35] months I think since 3 months is around
[42:37] 66 73 I would have expect to break this
[42:42] level earlier uh but I think the reason
[42:45] is many instit most of the Bitcoin
[42:48] investor in ETF ETF investor are still
[42:50] from retailers institution they know
[42:53] that the windows is open now they're
[42:55] paying attention to bitcoin but they
[42:56] need to do this due diligence uh
[42:59] Insurance funds Pension funds mutual
[43:01] funds is not like a retailer that they
[43:03] think one or two days and then they
[43:05] invest in Bitcoin so they will take some
[43:07] time but also this time will not be that
[43:10] much I think it's meas measurable in
[43:12] months uh so in the second half of 2024
[43:15] or latest C1 2025 we will see the real
[43:19] capital of Bitcoin we had also Gary
[43:21] Cardone is also in the financial World
[43:24] Wall Street and he's saying the same he
[43:26] will they will come and it's not in two
[43:28] or three years because before the ETF
[43:31] they were not even paying attention to
[43:33] bitcoin because it would have been too
[43:35] hard and not possible to buy the real
[43:37] spot Bitcoin even Michael sailor as a
[43:39] CEO a Visionary CEO took six months to
[43:43] convince the board as a CEO imagine
[43:45] someone in the company thinking on
[43:48] bitcoin how much will it take will take
[43:49] maybe 10 years uh but with ETF the part
[43:53] that is um accounting uh low uh tax is
[43:57] all gone because there is nothing
[43:59] nothing more to investigate because the
[44:01] ETF is a really superate uh super
[44:04] regulated product so if they want to the
[44:08] to acquire or to buy there is no law to
[44:11] be complying there is no legal and there
[44:14] is no accountability problem accounting
[44:17] problem because it's super regulated but
[44:19] still it's a new asset so I think they
[44:22] will take maybe two three four months
[44:24] and then we will see the real capital on
[44:27] Bitcoin and I think what will happen
[44:28] will be the move from gradually and then
[44:31] uh Suddenly at one point there will be
[44:34] an inflection point where uh no one at
[44:36] the moment no one want to be in the
[44:38] first row because is some they can risk
[44:40] their job but at the same time no one's
[44:43] no one wants to be in the last row so
[44:46] once it will be agreed that 1 2 3% in
[44:49] portfolio we will assist at a kind of a
[44:51] Bitcoin Rush similar to the Gold Rush
[44:53] 150 years ago in California but it will
[44:56] be much more faster because it's Global
[44:58] he digital everyone has a a broker
[45:01] account so we are waiting for this do
[45:04] you have uh price predictions uh your
[45:07] sell for like 2024 uh 2025 for the
[45:10] upcoming uh Bull Run uh where you're
[45:12] like this should be the uh this should
[45:15] be like the minimum where like Bitcoin
[45:17] should read I mean it's impossible to
[45:19] say first of all like that's why we're
[45:21] not trading it uh maybe we can even like
[45:25] when I posted the post like what
[45:27] question do you have for Michael sailor
[45:29] there were so many people asking me
[45:30] about the power law I did not ask
[45:32] Michael sailor because I think it's
[45:34] really boring to ask him about the power
[45:36] up because he always mentioned like all
[45:38] models will be yes I I'm thinking the
[45:40] same as him is and so you think like the
[45:43] power as a model and then it just will
[45:45] break I so okay yes uh discuss about
[45:48] this uh firstly it's not clear which
[45:53] price which the power low will be um
[45:57] FS will not be will be broken let's say
[46:00] because I heard at the end of the year
[46:02] it can be 90 it should be
[46:04] 93,000 but even if it is 300,000 is
[46:07] still in the theory uh it's in the model
[46:10] so if this is the high range I wonder
[46:13] which is uh the use of it for sure it's
[46:16] it's a great Theory to see if um joanni
[46:20] found the way to see how things develop
[46:23] and the price is developing but if 93 is
[46:27] the target 350 still on the Range there
[46:29] is not real utility and is that range
[46:32] also down yes it's I think one standard
[46:35] deviation down and two standard
[46:37] deviation up that's why I think the
[46:39] lowest is the lower range is is much
[46:42] smaller than the higher range what's the
[46:45] what's the do you know also 90 90 is the
[46:47] 90,000 is the Target and what's the
[46:49] lowest I don't know I also ask uh it
[46:52] would be great to have a table at the
[46:53] end of the year which is the target
[46:55] lower range
[46:57] and lower range and higher range so
[46:59] lower limit and higher limit and then we
[47:01] can track it um but I didn't have any
[47:05] answer so far yeah I mean it's it's also
[47:07] fascinating for me and the the range is
[47:09] that high yes then yeah Bitcoin is going
[47:12] up in the long term okay this I yes I
[47:14] know it already Yes because that can
[47:16] also make like oh end of the year I
[47:18] guess it's between 50,000 and and
[47:20] 400,000 yeah it will probably be very
[47:24] rad 99% so okay let's not discuss about
[47:28] the prediction firstly what we say is
[47:30] not a financial advice let that I think
[47:34] by the end of the year uh between 150
[47:37] and 200 and by the end of next year uh 4
[47:41] or
[47:42] 500,000 what AB I I think for all of us
[47:46] is really hard to comprehend the amount
[47:49] of capital that uh it will be flowing in
[47:52] Bitcoin the next 18 months and we
[47:55] because once this the institution have
[47:57] TR also Black Rock has 10 trillion 1% of
[48:01] Black Rock will be 100 billion in
[48:03] Bitcoin and that will be huge and this
[48:05] only about black Ro we not talking about
[48:07] mutual funds Pension funds there are
[48:09] like tens of thousand of trillions where
[48:12] we can take from maybe one or
[48:15] 2% and um on this this is one side
[48:19] second microeconomic situation they will
[48:21] print money so there will be more and
[48:23] more money so people will invest more in
[48:26] Bitcoin
[48:27] third Supply on Bitcoin exchange are
[48:30] going down I think the draw the Bitcoin
[48:34] going down from 69 to 16k was also a big
[48:37] cleanup because all the tourist on
[48:40] bitcoin went away and they were flashed
[48:43] out everyone sold apart of the real
[48:45] bitcoiners who draw who ride the C from
[48:48] 69 to 16k and also from 16 to
[48:52] 30k really were mostly bitcoiners or
[48:55] hodlers who bought Bitcoin because
[48:58] normal people for common people they
[48:59] will say oh it's too risky went down I
[49:02] don't want to think about this so most
[49:03] of Bitcoin are in the hands of Bitcoin
[49:06] ERS yes so I think if we combine demand
[49:10] Supply microeconomic situation we are we
[49:14] we are having a great setup for an
[49:16] upcoming Supply shock I think at one
[49:19] point will happen I assume in the next
[49:21] 18 months uh but all the trends
[49:24] indicators are towards today
[49:27] I have a interesting question that I
[49:29] talk a lot about uh on my podcast or not
[49:31] a lot but sometimes it comes up uh the
[49:33] question is like how many Bitcoin should
[49:35] someone have uh and for me it's really
[49:38] interesting because it depends on the
[49:40] various factors like yes uh do you want
[49:43] to retire on your Bitcoin uh I don't
[49:46] drag how many Bitcoin I want because I'm
[49:48] just all in uh but there there are some
[49:50] people are like oh I want to have a good
[49:53] portion of Bitcoin I have uh I'm I'm
[49:56] maybe on the more wealthier side and I
[49:58] can afford stuff where where should I go
[50:02] like uh like that like is it's one
[50:06] Bitcoin the the Northstar uh if I have
[50:09] the possibility should I aim for 10 uh
[50:12] it's like it's 0.1 because with Bitcoin
[50:15] is actually 100 years and we get so
[50:17] scares and everyone wants it like 0.1
[50:20] Bitcoin is already a lot of money it's
[50:23] like I think if Bitcoin is actually uh
[50:25] money and adopted by everyone uh
[50:29] 0.02 or 00002 is something like the what
[50:32] the average person can have okay so it's
[50:36] like really low how do you see that
[50:38] topic yeah that's true but also now also
[50:41] the average uh um network of a person if
[50:44] you consider all the countries also is
[50:46] quite low so in the west world we have
[50:48] more so we should not if it depends also
[50:51] where you live let's say in the First
[50:53] World Europe US Canada Australia um
[50:57] they have already more than the a
[51:00] so I would say one so one Bitcoin will
[51:04] be a huge thing by the end of the decade
[51:06] if people can reach one Bitcoin um I
[51:09] think if you were not in Bitcoin uh till
[51:12] now the window of to acquire one Bitcoin
[51:16] uh it's closing and it's closing soon
[51:19] because uh it's not the middle class or
[51:22] even the middle upper class if Bitcoin
[51:24] reach 100K or 120k
[51:27] it will if you don't have anything and
[51:29] also not only um money on bitcoin but
[51:32] also knowledge it will it takes time to
[51:35] convince yourself to to be exposed in
[51:38] Bitcoin also when you start now you have
[51:40] 3% but when you started it was maybe 3%
[51:44] 5% so considering that the price will be
[51:47] above 100K and it's taking time to build
[51:50] a convention I think already one Bitcoin
[51:52] will be huge like even now with like uh
[51:56] around the 60 70,000
[51:59] range like how many people have now 60
[52:02] 70,000 to spare or to to develop like
[52:07] even now like uh it's really hard to get
[52:09] to one F to one pitco and if it's like
[52:11] doubles from here which you can easily
[52:14] do till the end of the year or like when
[52:16] something happens even in like one two
[52:19] months or in one month yeah yeah sure so
[52:21] it can easily happen not saying it will
[52:24] happen but it can easily Happ which is
[52:27] interesting as like even one Bitcoin is
[52:29] like this this North Star that will be
[52:31] really rare and I think like in the
[52:33] future a whole coin first of all you
[52:35] should never say that you're whole
[52:37] coiner but that will be
[52:38] huge yes H yes because not only to one
[52:43] thing is to save 1,000 1,000 100,000 to
[52:48] save is a lot but second also to build
[52:50] the convention to be very exposed in
[52:52] Bitcoin it also it takes time it cannot
[52:54] be done in one month a person cannot
[52:56] move from uh not having anything to have
[52:59] 70% in Bitcoin and also the education
[53:04] the current education is uh buy a house
[53:08] repay the loan as much as fast as
[53:10] possible but I don't think it's the
[53:12] right thing so for sure buying a house
[53:15] you avoid the rent but if buying a house
[53:18] it brings you so much more uh cost
[53:21] because it's not only the loan once you
[53:23] buy a when you own a house you have the
[53:24] maintenance the property tax
[53:27] then you spend more money on the house
[53:29] and also you want many people they want
[53:31] to repay the loan as early as possible
[53:33] so they they prevent themselves to to
[53:37] invest if they have they are maybe uh I
[53:40] know that also Bitcoin is a lot of
[53:42] owning but if owning something cost you
[53:45] so much that you cannot invest in
[53:46] Bitcoin maybe it makes more sense to
[53:48] keep renting well renting like any you
[53:51] don't have the risk of any big issue to
[53:54] pay and no uh that you don't have loan
[53:56] to repay so you can invest in Bitcoin
[53:58] and maybe buy a house when your
[54:00] investment in Bitcoin will go um will be
[54:04] higher and higher one option um also I'm
[54:07] not so early in Bitcoin my average price
[54:09] is uh around
[54:12] $30,000 but now I am mostly in Bitcoin
[54:15] so uh part of savings so once Bitcoin
[54:19] you reach maybe
[54:20] 300K uh maybe I will buy um an apart a
[54:25] house or apartment with
[54:27] two Bitcoin and uh but for this two
[54:29] Bitcoin I paid
[54:31] $60,000 and House cost
[54:35] 600,000 so that would be the the big
[54:38] change I love the comparison with real
[54:41] estate and Bitcoin because I think real
[54:43] estate people are one of the biggest
[54:46] people and and and W wealthiest people
[54:50] that actually will see like oh Bitcoin
[54:53] is actually like property uh and I don't
[54:56] have to search for uh tenants I don't
[54:59] have to deal with everything and there's
[55:01] so much noisy stuff around realist that
[55:04] you don't want to deal with and you have
[55:06] to employ someone to care for that a
[55:08] real estate is a really messy thing it's
[55:11] like a business you have to care it's
[55:13] not an investment for business or yes so
[55:16] if you unless you do you start already
[55:19] with high stakes you have already five
[55:21] six eight Apartments otherwise yes is
[55:24] not to make money and also because every
[55:28] generation had his um Advantage for some
[55:33] asset 10 years ago or 30 years ago is
[55:36] when the the house is start to go up
[55:39] actually it's not a coincidence after we
[55:41] have the fat system because the problem
[55:43] is people are seeing the house as an
[55:45] investment but if you buy for example
[55:47] living in Munich 10 years ago the house
[55:50] was cost much less and so those who
[55:52] bought 10 years ago they had a great
[55:55] appreciation or also 20 years ago 25
[55:58] years ago but I don't think the price
[56:00] will increase as such in the next 10
[56:03] years we have high interest rate and uh
[56:06] already we see many people uh couples
[56:10] who both studied where 20 years ago they
[56:13] could have afford a house now they
[56:15] struggle to reach an apartment to buy an
[56:18] apartment so the price of the real
[56:20] estate will not go as high as uh before
[56:24] and then as you said there is property
[56:25] taxes that many other uh things that
[56:27] people are not um considering another
[56:30] small thing if you buy a house that cost
[56:32] maybe 400,000 you don't pay all this
[56:35] 400,000 if you have an agency you pay 3%
[56:37] to the agency if you the notary cost 10
[56:40] 12% so you pay maybe 60,000 on top and
[56:43] you should consider also this money uh
[56:46] for uh
[56:47] evaluating and uh later on it is more
[56:51] and more clear that the house is not
[56:53] anymore as good as it was before and
[56:56] also it will not appreciate that
[56:59] like when I came into the world of
[57:04] business and finances uh and I had money
[57:07] to spare and and thought like what do I
[57:09] do with that money before I came into
[57:11] Bitcoin I was in stocks okay but uh I
[57:14] really was in plans like in
[57:17] 20189 to get into real estate I was like
[57:21] I want to buy my first rental property
[57:25] and Bitcoin dis dropped at that b
[57:27] because I was like like why should like
[57:30] I I really research deeply what does it
[57:33] uh mean to own a rental property what
[57:35] work do I have to do what do I have to
[57:36] care for and and I made all those lists
[57:39] and all those documents and research
[57:41] things and I was like that's a lot of
[57:43] work but I like it more than than than
[57:45] stocks and then uh this Bitcoin thing
[57:48] came along and I was like oh that's
[57:49] actually like property that's actually
[57:51] like prop digital property that you can
[57:53] own you don't have to have all um uh
[57:58] real estate property you have a digital
[58:01] property in cyberspace in a in a love
[58:04] that comparison that sure I think M made
[58:07] it popular I don't know if someone else
[58:09] said it before uh and I love that yeah
[58:13] yeah Michael S also said several good
[58:15] definition digital one is a digital code
[58:18] overall but also digital energy because
[58:20] it allows us to save our energy in
[58:22] something that doesn't inflate so is not
[58:25] evaluated but for sure yes you can own
[58:27] Bitcoin and it is cars uh also the the
[58:30] houses that appreciate the most are the
[58:32] one on the beach for example in Miami or
[58:34] in New York Manhattan because it's SCS
[58:37] and Bitcoin is the ultimate scarcity
[58:39] because it's finite so that's also great
[58:42] great comparison absolutely and um
[58:45] before we come to slowly to the end
[58:47] routin I have one more question how do
[58:50] you personally see inflation rates and
[58:55] and the microecon IC sides of things is
[58:58] there a metric where you look at that's
[59:00] that's the inflation rate I look at as
[59:02] the hurdle rate uh like for example I
[59:05] like to look at the S&P 500 I like to
[59:07] look at uh maybe real estate uh prices
[59:10] on average at ins in certain areas is
[59:13] there anything where like that's the
[59:15] inflation rate I I go to and how do you
[59:18] uh see more because I think you U
[59:20] mentioned it before you want to talk a
[59:21] little bit about the macroeconomics side
[59:23] of things yes so I think P 500 and the
[59:27] price of the house is the real indicator
[59:30] of inflation also Michael saor in the
[59:33] prag last year made a point on this and
[59:36] in average is between 6 7% per year and
[59:39] this is not because the value it's more
[59:42] but because they printed more money H
[59:45] not only stimulus check but uh interest
[59:48] on depbt and and all the rest uh related
[59:50] topic um so I think the real inflation
[59:54] it's more than uh the one that the CPI
[59:56] is mentioning that said also with the
[59:59] oldest way how we measure inflation CPI
[60:02] in the 7 in8 will be much higher will be
[60:05] instead of 3% will be at 5
[60:07] 6% uh also these years and secondly also
[60:11] inflation by default is very hard to um
[60:16] to really measure because our we humans
[60:20] Human Action we have different desiles
[60:22] what we like 10 years ago we don't like
[60:24] now something that was in the bucket 10
[60:28] years ago is not in the bucket now some
[60:30] things they become more uh cheaper they
[60:32] become they become cheaper so it's also
[60:34] by default is there is not really a
[60:36] quantitative number but assuming uh the
[60:39] price of S&P and um and real estate is
[60:43] around 6 7% per year and this is all due
[60:47] printing money and this is something
[60:50] that the common people still are had
[60:53] problem to get it now in the last two
[60:56] years they many they grasp that there is
[60:59] a problem because so far inflation was
[61:01] 2% like in the last decade between 2010
[61:04] and 2020 inflation was lower many they
[61:07] still believe that 2% inflation is good
[61:10] to stimulate the economy that did
[61:12] something really nonsense uh for
[61:14] austrialian school of Economics but it
[61:16] sounds right because uh if people uh if
[61:18] the state is founding Works uh then uh
[61:22] the the economy will Thrive but in
[61:24] reality it is not for this we will need
[61:27] a much another it will be a different
[61:29] podcast but so far inflation was too low
[61:32] it was hard to convince people now with
[61:35] inflation of six 7even 8% people are
[61:38] seeing they have problem and they
[61:40] everyone has a a problem but the lower
[61:43] class so the mid low class has even a
[61:46] bigger problem firstly because they
[61:48] don't own any asset and they they leave
[61:52] paycheck to paycheck and once you don't
[61:54] have any asset uh and you leave paycheck
[61:57] to paycheck you get hit by inflation
[61:59] completely because very likely your
[62:01] paycheck didn't increase as much as
[62:03] inflation also food food is something
[62:07] that everyone needs and he went it
[62:09] didn't went up only 3 or 4% but the
[62:12] people say 20 30% I think everyone is
[62:15] realizing when we go to the supermarket
[62:17] we pay much more 20 or 30% and in the
[62:20] lower or the mid low class they spend
[62:23] the percentage they spend in food is
[62:24] much higher than than the one who have
[62:26] answered so is only is bad for everyone
[62:30] and even more for people in the lower
[62:31] meter class so we move from not
[62:35] understanding that inflation was bad to
[62:38] grasping the next step is to connect
[62:41] that we have inflation problem because
[62:43] we have monetary problem and the we have
[62:46] monetary problem because the system is
[62:48] broken so the Fiat system is inherently
[62:51] broken is broken by default and this is
[62:54] something that only still only very few
[62:57] people understand whenever you give the
[62:59] I read several books on AUST economics
[63:02] one thing is uh we need money comes for
[63:05] barter come from people choosing what is
[63:07] money and the first property is scarcity
[63:10] so the more scarcity the better gold
[63:13] will not ever
[63:14] been uh the biggest mon uh monetary
[63:17] usage in the last 5,000 years if he was
[63:20] not scars and uh now we are having a
[63:23] system where someone can uh not even
[63:26] print money in a machine but also push
[63:29] push a button and the money increase by
[63:32] 5 or 10% so it's a completely
[63:34] discrediting the
[63:35] history every time we print money it's
[63:38] like we take from the future for the
[63:40] present so we increase we improve the
[63:43] present the short term at the expense of
[63:45] the future and every time this money are
[63:50] printed um we create a misallocation
[63:53] also Austrian School of Economics
[63:55] discussed said a lot about the bubble
[63:57] bars so we create we are now create we
[64:00] created a bubble of money we saw for
[64:02] example the real estate in the
[64:05] 2000 one of the reason why in the 99s 29
[64:08] the cisis was there because they printed
[64:11] much a lot of money in the 20s but uh in
[64:15] the 1920s it's called The Roaring 20s
[64:18] because they printed like 60% of the
[64:20] money and then this misallocation
[64:23] created a burst and now we are seeing
[64:26] there is like the Geno is already out of
[64:28] the Bumble we have a us who is having
[64:31] revenue of 4.4 trillion per year and
[64:35] expense of 6.2 trillion so 1.8 trillion
[64:38] deficit that's
[64:40] insane with a depth of
[64:43] 34.7 trillion if we if we apply this
[64:48] amount saying a person is uh earning
[64:51] 44k th000 and is spending 62,000 per
[64:55] year and he has a depth of 340,000 we
[64:59] will all think this person is over he
[65:01] should declare uh theault because he
[65:04] will never make it um but for uh the
[65:07] state we say no we keep going and the
[65:10] only solution is printing more money
[65:12] because uh making assume that we are a
[65:15] politician what will you do you cut the
[65:19] spending one solution will be cut by
[65:21] spending by 1.8 trillion you cannot cut
[65:24] firstly there are interest on the depth
[65:27] military um the security or pension the
[65:33] health care this is very hard to cut in
[65:35] such an extent and secondly if you say
[65:38] okay I will cut the spense by 20% you
[65:40] will never go you will never be voted
[65:43] elected the other solution is increase
[65:45] even more taxes and uh the taxes are
[65:48] already high and also if you increase
[65:50] even more it's not sure that you will
[65:52] get more Revenue because the higher the
[65:54] taxes Maybe uh the less the economy
[65:57] stimulated so there will be the revenue
[65:59] can also decrease the other will be to
[66:02] declare the fault and they will not
[66:04] declare the the only solution viable
[66:06] solution will be to print money so they
[66:09] will keep printing not because they want
[66:11] to print but it will be the only way to
[66:13] keep the broken system running it's like
[66:16] is like a a person under drugs that is
[66:19] trying to recover from the drugs but you
[66:21] don't want to have this recover and you
[66:23] give him more drugs so he stays one or
[66:25] two days more and then other two days
[66:28] the depth is higher much higher than 30
[66:31] years ago and then you you give him
[66:34] other drugs to have it uh that to have
[66:36] it not recover not to have the pain of
[66:38] recover so for the short term could be a
[66:41] good solution because you don't have the
[66:42] reset you don't have the recession but
[66:45] in the long term it is detrimental
[66:47] because the the reset will come harder
[66:51] and harder so I assume they will keep PR
[66:54] printing money
[66:56] they will change the 2% Target inflation
[66:59] I heard I already saw read some article
[67:02] saying we should have 3 or 4% because
[67:06] you cannot bring the inflation anymore
[67:07] at 2% so at one point there will be 3 or
[67:10] 4% the Target and then inflation will be
[67:13] keeping going higher and the big
[67:16] question is can we cope with the
[67:19] multiple years of 8% or 10% inflation I
[67:23] guess we cannot cope many years we saw
[67:25] already
[67:26] 8% inflation what happened to families
[67:29] Imaging other 8% and then other 8% also
[67:33] considering the second % is already is
[67:37] hitting you more than the first %
[67:40] because maybe at the beginning you have
[67:41] savings you can cope with the first 8%
[67:44] but then in you you are less savings
[67:47] you're already spending more then you
[67:48] have other 8% so the effect will be more
[67:51] than double so I think that
[67:54] unfortunately that is what will happen
[67:56] we will have higher inflation in the
[67:58] next years we should forget uh inflation
[68:01] lower than 2% yeah the the inflation
[68:03] Target will inflate yes yes because they
[68:07] there is no way there is no way more we
[68:09] are in the setup is in a way that 2%
[68:12] inflation is not reachable
[68:14] anymore um when you look at that whole
[68:19] thing that you just painted that picture
[68:22] yes and we paint that picture longer out
[68:25] than the future um at some point we will
[68:28] get to the point where the fear system
[68:30] just
[68:32] implodes yes we don't know when but
[68:35] every Fiat system uh we discussed in the
[68:38] first in first podcast is designed to
[68:41] inflate or to inflate or declaring
[68:43] theault even the dollar at one point
[68:45] will happen I know some people are
[68:48] saying in two three five years I don't
[68:50] think we are there also because the
[68:52] dollar is also the global Reserve asset
[68:54] the global Reserve currency so if
[68:55] another country inflates they want
[68:57] dollars they don't want Bitcoin because
[68:59] Bitcoin is too new so they will want
[69:01] dollars so this will also be in favor of
[69:04] the dollars as a reserve but maybe in 20
[69:07] 30 years um there is the chance that uh
[69:11] after some years of inflation at 10 12
[69:13] 15
[69:15] 20% um also here gradually and then
[69:18] suddenly a one point will go very
[69:21] high this also going going down in the
[69:24] rabbit hole I think we all understood
[69:26] how the Fiat system uh is broken
[69:29] absolutely I love it a lot what you're
[69:31] saying uh and I reson a lot with your
[69:34] your messaging also um I think we're
[69:37] coming closer unfortunately my my watch
[69:38] is not working but I think we're coming
[69:40] closer to the podcast end yes um and I
[69:42] have one new question that I asked now
[69:45] almost every guest uh that I did not ask
[69:49] you uh in the first podcast um and the
[69:55] the question is what are you currently
[69:57] deeply learning about uh or really
[69:59] passionate about besides Bitcoin and I
[70:01] also tell you why I'm so passionate
[70:03] about that question because bitcoiners
[70:05] are really interesting people we are at
[70:06] this conference now we are uh I don't
[70:08] know how good we can see it in the
[70:10] camera but we are in the middle of the
[70:11] biggest Bitcoin conference in in Europe
[70:14] right now is like there's behind us a
[70:16] stage there's like boovs around there's
[70:18] people I already saw like five six
[70:20] people like standing and and making
[70:21] pictures of the podcast and looking
[70:23] forward to to the feedback there um
[70:26] but when you see uh uh all those amazing
[70:30] people you notice that they have amazing
[70:32] things to say they have really
[70:33] interesting even outside of Bitcoin um
[70:36] what are you most passionate about and
[70:39] deeply learning about besides Bitcoin
[70:41] and so we can learn from each other okay
[70:43] we can learn from from each other H yes
[70:45] so I he made also me in firstly I this
[70:50] also your question make me also one I
[70:52] said even more to realize that the
[70:55] common people they think that Bitcoin
[70:57] and crypto guys are the same and here we
[70:59] are discussing about the society
[71:01] civilization learning uh I think what
[71:04] Bitcoin uh is teaching me and uh firstly
[71:08] to to not you don't need to have so much
[71:11] consuming things uh also I'm not in
[71:14] favor that you should downgrade your
[71:17] life really really with the basics but
[71:20] also for sure not luxury things so you
[71:21] should focus on more on experience on
[71:24] the spending time with friends spending
[71:26] time with family with your love and um
[71:30] this is what it changed me and also it
[71:32] pushed you more to self-development so I
[71:35] I also restarted again to to learn to
[71:38] read books or uh listen to podcast
[71:41] related to self-development you you see
[71:44] how important is uh uh the value of of
[71:48] time for example before I was giving uh
[71:50] less important on time so I'm trying to
[71:53] use more my time to develop myself uh
[71:57] one thing is uh sport keep me as much as
[72:01] uh in um trained as possible because my
[72:04] health will be first maybe the biggest
[72:06] asset our life is limited H and second
[72:09] trying to develop myself as well amazing
[72:13] I love it and the endro team that you
[72:14] already know uh and you were the first
[72:17] podcast guest actually I think I took
[72:19] because I have to end that the previous
[72:21] guest is asking a question for the next
[72:22] guest but you're the first guest on my
[72:24] podcast so I did not had a previous
[72:26] guest before you and I think uh your
[72:28] question came from like my sister or
[72:31] something I I don't even remember
[72:32] exactly how I didn't I think my sister
[72:35] gave the question to you but uh your
[72:38] question came from Princess bring from
[72:41] uh in Mark and we made it in the last
[72:43] podcast uh and the question is really
[72:45] cool from the previous guest for you um
[72:48] with the medical advancements and with
[72:50] the technical advancements uh could you
[72:54] imagine that we uh could live uh to be
[73:00] so old that we actually see the last
[73:03] subsidy of Bitcoin in
[73:06] 2140 uh and we actually live to there
[73:09] with all the medical and Technical
[73:11] advancement that we might have there I
[73:13] mean it's toally not a medical question
[73:15] but I will be almost 160
[73:20] years H I don't think so uh several
[73:23] studies saying uh that whatever we do uh
[73:27] there is a cap at 120 years oh and so
[73:32] it's like similar to the supply of
[73:34] Bitcoin is Cap I I think what uh medical
[73:38] advancement uh and also now we we Al our
[73:42] choice to keep uh for food sleeping
[73:45] Sport and so on can keep us uh down
[73:49] degrading less and later uh but after 80
[73:53] or 90 years old the likelihood to have
[73:57] any pathology it's quite high so I will
[74:01] be for me it will be I don't think we
[74:03] will reach uh there will be the chance
[74:05] the cup is 120 uh but I will be happy if
[74:08] I arrive at 80 85 or uh in a good State
[74:12] considering that age that I'm still can
[74:14] do everything by myself I uh I don't
[74:17] think I will we will have the chance to
[74:19] it will be good to see the last substit
[74:21] of Bitcoin we will definitely make a
[74:22] podcast then
[74:25] it will be a bit slower maybe we talk
[74:27] like maybe we talk a little
[74:30] slower it it will be like two three
[74:32] hours long but we we get the only the
[74:35] first 10 minutes in there yes uh perfect
[74:39] then uh before I let you go where can
