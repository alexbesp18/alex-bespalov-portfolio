[00:00] Bitcoin is the new currency it will
[00:02] replace the dollar it will replace the
[00:04] Euro and it will replace the Yen we are
[00:06] going to live that world we are going
[00:09] into complete science fiction here I
[00:10] think it'll be very clear 10 years from
[00:12] now that yeah I don't I don't really
[00:14] want US Dollars anymore probably in the
[00:17] 5 to 10 million range is going up
[00:21] relative to the six power of time so
[00:23] it's going up in a linear fashion very
[00:25] predictably there's so much money out
[00:27] there that most of the money is still on
[00:30] the fences it's just the very tip is
[00:32] coming into Bitcoin at this point
[00:33] Bitcoin is fundamentally not compatible
[00:35] with kyc kyc doesn't work it's
[00:38] completely and utterly useless thing
[00:41] that by the way was exactly what Satoshi
[00:43] created bitcoin for it's peer-to-peer
[00:45] I'm very bullish on these ETFs we
[00:47] haven't seen anything yet it's just
[00:49] going to grow like crazy if we got to
[00:52] 200,000 in the next 6
[00:54] [Music]
[00:57] months where do you see Bitcoin future
[01:00] in like 20 years price level but also
[01:03] like in general where where do where do
[01:05] you see Bitcoin evolved in 20 years so
[01:07] what I think I think Bitcoin is money
[01:11] and I think it is a replacement for the
[01:14] Fiat system that we have
[01:16] now uh and I do think that in 20 years
[01:21] if you go to a restaurant you'll be
[01:23] paying in Bitcoin if you go to a hotel
[01:25] you'll be paying in Bitcoin and you'll
[01:28] probably be paying your taxes in bit
[01:29] Bitcoin as well okay so I actually
[01:33] believe that Bitcoin is the new currency
[01:36] it will replace the dollar it will
[01:38] replace the Euro and it will replace the
[01:42] Yen that's what I believe okay now you
[01:47] know these things take a long time and
[01:49] they're sort of hard to see there's such
[01:51] you know
[01:52] they it it's been going for 15 years and
[01:55] so will it have completely done it by 20
[01:57] years no but I think it'll be pretty
[01:59] obvious that it that it will be there we
[02:02] may be in sort of this buy system you
[02:04] know where there there still is the Euro
[02:07] to some extent but most people are using
[02:10] Bitcoin um you know we've seen sort of
[02:13] these uh changes where you know you had
[02:16] two sort of things working at the same
[02:18] time I remember when the Euro came into
[02:21] uh France you know I was I was in France
[02:23] at the time you know and we had this
[02:25] transition from the Frank to the euro
[02:27] you know and for a while you could
[02:29] exchange French Franks for Euro and then
[02:32] after a while those French Franks were
[02:33] not exchangeable anymore you know and uh
[02:37] and I still have some you know somewhere
[02:39] I have an old 500 Frank bill you know
[02:42] that uh that's useless you know I can't
[02:45] even go to the central bank and exchange
[02:47] it anymore but I do think that we're in
[02:49] this phase of of of that so I do think
[02:51] it's the new world money and I think
[02:54] it's going to change everything because
[02:56] it's not just it's not money that you
[02:58] can print it's you know it has this
[03:00] finite Supply so it's a different kind
[03:02] of money uh that that kind of money will
[03:05] will um will be used as a savings
[03:09] account as well as as a sort of a
[03:12] checking account in one um but I think
[03:15] in order to get there I think we have to
[03:19] get to you know over Bitcoin 1 million
[03:22] in order to get to the point where it
[03:24] fulfills that role right so I think if
[03:27] everybody's using Bitcoin as as sort of
[03:30] the money that everybody uses bitcoin's
[03:33] probably in the you know five to 10
[03:37] million kind of Mark kind of range
[03:40] somewhere around there you know uh
[03:41] depending on what it you know uh what
[03:44] the price of a cup of coffee is which is
[03:46] sort of you know uncertainty but I do
[03:49] think that's where we're going with this
[03:50] thing is it is it's a fundamental shift
[03:54] in in money um as far as you know this
[03:59] sort of better money but it's also a
[04:01] fundamental shift in like the power of
[04:05] these large governments to just
[04:07] endlessly print money to do whatever
[04:09] they want uh I think it's going to
[04:11] reduce that power sub substantially I
[04:14] also think like that because I
[04:16] personally have like I'm 100% in Bitcoin
[04:18] so um I would love to also like be able
[04:21] to spend it pay my taxes in there and
[04:23] all everything and it's kind of pain in
[04:25] the ass right now because I cannot spend
[04:27] it uh there are like two reasons that
[04:29] kind of prevent it first of all like
[04:31] it's very volatile which makes it a
[04:33] little bit less attractive to like spend
[04:35] it uh because there could be such a high
[04:38] uh swing up and the second one is the
[04:40] bigger one it's like tax implications
[04:42] like I I would have to pay taxes if
[04:45] there are gains on the the things that
[04:47] when I spend it um but I think with when
[04:49] we are coming there and Bitcoin is going
[04:51] there is is it then kind of the
[04:54] invention of money because it's the
[04:56] first asset that is just the use case of
[04:58] money like gold has use cases in
[05:00] industrial things other things also have
[05:02] like some other use cases it's kind of
[05:04] like the the first yeah I mean I think
[05:06] it's an invention of certain kind of
[05:08] money look I think if you look at for
[05:10] example you know what is the internet
[05:13] right well the internet sort of evolved
[05:15] from being the worldwide web under Tim
[05:18] burner's Lee that vision of the internet
[05:21] right where we're going to have these
[05:22] textual websites to then we had sort of
[05:27] you know things like macromedia flash on
[05:29] these kind of very heavy websites right
[05:32] to then we had a websit really just a
[05:35] page on Facebook you know what I mean so
[05:37] things evolve right so money has evolved
[05:39] just like the internet has evolved what
[05:41] the what the internet is is is so
[05:44] different from what Tim burner Lee
[05:46] thought the internet or the the web was
[05:48] right it's it's completely changed and I
[05:51] think money is is going to change but I
[05:54] I do think that that's going to be kind
[05:55] of the last version of money right so I
[05:58] think that's that's the one that sort of
[06:00] sticks and I don't think and I do think
[06:02] there will be some changes to bitcoin
[06:04] even 20 years from now right but I think
[06:07] they'll be subtle um you know I I do
[06:10] feel like most of the work was done with
[06:13] Satoshi and that there's you know
[06:15] there's a few tweaks that are still
[06:16] needed probably uh to
[06:20] really uh scale it and so on um but by
[06:26] and far for the most part it's it's it's
[06:28] solved do you do you have already
[06:29] something like that that you see now
[06:31] that we kind of have to to solve in kind
[06:34] of like the small tweaks that we have to
[06:35] make or is is that kind kind of not hard
[06:37] to see right now well I think look I
[06:40] think it's it's pretty clear to me that
[06:43] if it you're going to need to have uh
[06:47] these layer tws right you're going to
[06:49] need to have some version of Layer Two
[06:51] now that could mean that could mean you
[06:53] know lightning that could mean sort of
[06:55] custodial type layer toos like cash app
[06:58] right uh it could mean something more
[07:02] fundamental like you know some of this
[07:04] opcat stuff that people are talking
[07:06] about right with with working with
[07:09] things other other blockchains
[07:11] potentially right to kind of uh to to
[07:14] get to make it but you're going to need
[07:16] to have some changes to bitcoin to do
[07:19] that you're going to need to change have
[07:20] certain op codes that are added to
[07:22] bitcoin to do that I don't think it's
[07:25] something that we need to worry about
[07:27] now today uh but I do think it's kind of
[07:29] inevitable that Bitcoin Bitcoin right
[07:33] now has this fundamental limit that you
[07:36] have about 200 million transactions per
[07:39] year that can happen on the Bitcoin
[07:41] blockchain right now if you're going to
[07:43] use the Bitcoin blockchain in any way
[07:46] and even if it's going to be used with
[07:48] lightning right and you have a billion
[07:51] people using it you know you really have
[07:55] those people can only use it once every
[07:57] five years you know so it you know
[08:00] unless you're it's just this pet rock
[08:02] that you can hold and you can sell every
[08:04] five years it doesn't scale to the
[08:06] billion person level as is right now
[08:10] right you you just can't you don't get
[08:12] there you know so you need we're not at
[08:15] the point of you know urgency it's but
[08:17] and it can scale right we can get it to
[08:20] go up uh now you know one way that you
[08:25] know people were talking about back in
[08:26] 2016 20 from 2015 to 201 17 was to
[08:30] increase the block size right and there
[08:32] was obviously these huge Wars around
[08:34] that right um in the end the sort of
[08:37] smaller block size one you know uh for
[08:41] now I would say uh and look it was it
[08:44] won by a compromise right we started at
[08:46] one megabyte right we kind of ended at
[08:48] four kind of you know with segwit um but
[08:52] it you know it was a very much of a
[08:54] compromise and and I think sort of
[08:55] nobody really loves the current system
[08:58] that much uh
[09:00] but you know could It Go could it go up
[09:02] to 16
[09:04] megabytes uh yeah it could you know what
[09:06] I mean like there's not it's not a huge
[09:10] problem right now from a cost of storage
[09:13] perspective to go that high now you
[09:16] could argue that that may not solve
[09:18] bitcoin's total scalability even if it
[09:20] was four times as big as it is today
[09:22] right that and that that that's probably
[09:25] true um but that's one way you can
[09:28] change it right the other way you can
[09:29] change it I think uh a better way is to
[09:32] have certain op codes that you can that
[09:34] you can use so that it's interchangeable
[09:37] that you can have wrapped Bitcoin on
[09:39] other blockchains and it could be on
[09:41] ethereum it could be on you know a
[09:44] blockchain that doesn't even exist today
[09:46] right um it could be on private
[09:48] blockchains it could be on even uh
[09:51] Central Bank digital uh currency
[09:54] blockchains right there could be all
[09:56] kinds of ways that you could that you
[09:58] can wrap Bitcoin and and allow for it to
[10:01] be moved in and out in a in a kind of a
[10:05] very safe way right but uh we're going
[10:08] to have to do something if Bitcoin
[10:10] starts being used for Commerce we have
[10:13] to do something uh what that is is to be
[10:17] determined and I'm sure that they're
[10:19] going to fight like crazy it'll be
[10:21] similar to The Block Wars of of of
[10:23] between 2015 and 2017 so I'm sure there
[10:26] will be fights but I I am also convinced
[10:29] that uh Bitcoin will uh make the right
[10:33] decision right I feel like the community
[10:35] will make the right decision and and
[10:37] Bitcoin will evolve in the in the kind
[10:39] of the correct way it's just a belief
[10:42] you know I didn't have that belief
[10:44] necessarily in 2016 right so I think you
[10:48] know it was a little more scary back
[10:50] then but now I think we're we're in
[10:52] better shape what what shaped this
[10:54] belief of yours like how how did you
[10:56] come to to have this better belief of of
[10:58] Bitcoin
[10:59] well you know look if you if you go back
[11:01] to that that period right we had people
[11:04] like you know Craig Wright right who
[11:06] were uh you know pushing these
[11:09] narratives and you know Roger ve and
[11:12] there was a lot of narratives and I
[11:14] think we know we're we all know more now
[11:17] than we knew back then right and so uh
[11:22] and I think we we also understand what
[11:23] are the objectives more right we all
[11:26] kind of want something that there's no
[11:29] there's nobody in charge of Bitcoin
[11:31] right there it's it's not somebody who
[11:33] says I have satoshi's Vision we nobody
[11:36] wants that right also nobody wants some
[11:40] enormous footprint that can only run in
[11:43] some big data center right having your
[11:47] own node is a very desirable thing that
[11:50] everybody can have their own node and
[11:52] you know if if people can signal their
[11:55] interest in Forks on their own node and
[11:58] not just Ming ERS that's also a good
[12:00] thing so I think
[12:03] the I think the community is is is is is
[12:07] probably in a better shape than it was
[12:09] you you know in say in 2017 2018 I mean
[12:13] it wasn't clear 100% clear to me who is
[12:18] going to win Bitcoin cash or Bitcoin
[12:20] regular Bitcoin in 2017 it you know it
[12:23] was sort of like you could make the case
[12:26] that Bitcoin was going to disintegrate
[12:27] into into all these competing
[12:30] forks and now I it now we're also in a
[12:34] we have the ETF we have Michael sailor
[12:36] we have you know we have we have
[12:39] Institute we have the adults are in the
[12:41] room you know so I think we're in a much
[12:45] better place of than than Bitcoin was
[12:48] you know in the sort of 10th anniversary
[12:50] of its you know existence that that's
[12:52] for sure and I feel like the the
[12:54] community is really has grown and I mean
[12:57] I'm just here since 2020 so cannot even
[12:59] really speak about the uh the aspect
[13:02] before um the aspect of the full n like
[13:04] the block is also interesting because I
[13:06] feel like storage costs will go down
[13:09] over time so it will be interesting what
[13:11] will the the same storage that you now
[13:14] need to for full note to get uh cost in
[13:17] like 10 years 20 years when we get
[13:19] better you have it's going down like
[13:22] much faster than uh it's going down as
[13:25] Mo's law right so bear in mind that look
[13:28] segwit you you know was sort of decided
[13:30] in 2017 right so this this we are this
[13:34] four
[13:35] megabytes okay we are uh prices have
[13:39] come down 10x since then 10x at least
[13:43] okay uh you know so you know you can you
[13:49] can you know you can build your own
[13:51] Bitcoin node for
[13:53] $150 right I did you know two years ago
[13:56] I did for probably today it's the same
[13:58] thing would be $100 right and it's not
[14:01] even the store the storage is $10 you
[14:03] know the chip so you know for a terabyte
[14:06] you know so like it's the cost of
[14:09] storage is not actually a factor anymore
[14:12] um you know I'm not saying we should
[14:15] have you know multiple terabytes for for
[14:19] bit for Bitcoin but you know 700
[14:22] megabytes to store Bitcoin is nothing
[14:24] right now it's it's not a it's just not
[14:26] really a factor so I I I definitely
[14:30] think we could go bigger but I obviously
[14:32] right now we don't have the need for it
[14:34] and you know I I also agree that I agree
[14:38] with Michael sailor and and the general
[14:40] Bitcoin community that unless there's an
[14:42] absolute pressing need and we you know
[14:46] the community is 90% in agreement that
[14:49] anything should be done we should do
[14:51] nothing right so we have to have almost
[14:54] 90% consensus in order to start touching
[14:58] Bitcoin at this point
[15:00] um and but I think at some point we will
[15:03] have 90% consensus on something I mean
[15:05] we we had for tap Roo believe it or not
[15:08] you know for tap rout we had 90%
[15:11] consensus and I think we had it because
[15:14] people were viewing this thing as okay
[15:16] this is a very technical thing that
[15:19] enables snore
[15:21] signatures it it helps lightning and it
[15:25] enables uh privacy of addresses of
[15:27] multisig addresses okay people like that
[15:30] can't hurt that's probably a good thing
[15:31] great I support it so everybody was
[15:34] supportive of this thing uh they
[15:37] probably wouldn't be supportive of it
[15:40] today right because of all the ordinals
[15:43] and everything so you know it it sort
[15:47] of so I think that the question is you
[15:51] know if we get to a point where if I
[15:55] think if if fees got to $100 per Bitcoin
[15:59] transaction very very
[16:02] routinely I think we would people would
[16:05] say wait a second this is this is not
[16:07] this is not what so this is not the the
[16:10] the the forget what even Satoshi would
[16:12] have wanted this is not the correct way
[16:14] we should be living it should not cost
[16:17] $100 to send a Bitcoin transaction
[16:19] that's
[16:20] ridiculous so you know it it should cost
[16:24] a couple dollars or less I think in an
[16:27] ideal one that's interesting because I
[16:28] had I feel like I think Wicked it was on
[16:33] and he spoke about future Bitcoin
[16:34] transactions he thinks that like Bitcoin
[16:37] transactions on a Bas layer will be
[16:39] extremely expensive and only for like a
[16:42] small institutional and small players
[16:44] yeah I I think you lose something if you
[16:46] do that right I mean you know it's again
[16:50] that's you know we go from you have to
[16:53] have this enormous data center to run a
[16:55] node right that's bad because it's great
[16:59] to run your own Noe or you know very
[17:01] easily right I I mean to me the one of
[17:04] the the most appealing things about
[17:06] Bitcoin is it Simplicity right it's a
[17:09] it's a small client the client the
[17:11] initial client was 30,000 lines of code
[17:14] right so it's a very small client it's a
[17:16] very simple conceptually to explain
[17:19] everything about Bitcoin right you can
[17:21] really get your head around the whole
[17:22] thing um and and you can transact with
[17:27] Bitcoin you can approach it you can do
[17:29] your first actual Bitcoin transaction
[17:32] yourself pretty easily you know I mean I
[17:35] could send you $5 worth of bitcoin you
[17:38] know not a problem and I think if we get
[17:41] to these really high fees where only
[17:43] institution can send it I think we lose
[17:46] something you know it's not for the
[17:48] people anymore it's sort of like you
[17:49] need these institutions to actually send
[17:51] the Bitcoin I I that I don't I disagree
[17:55] with I don't think you know I think I'll
[17:57] have that debate with Wicked because I
[17:59] just do not agree with that idea like
[18:02] I'd say is that the reason we're having
[18:04] you know 4 megabyte blocks you know with
[18:06] seg what like no you know at that point
[18:09] go to 16 megabyte blocks go to 100
[18:11] megabyte blocks you know but figure out
[18:14] some way that these Bitcoin fees should
[18:17] not be $500 $1,000 per per fee that that
[18:21] does not that's not a common sense it
[18:24] doesn't make any common sense to me yeah
[18:29] it's it's correct I feel like I mean I
[18:30] don't think look let me put it this way
[18:32] Robin you you've done some Bitcoin
[18:34] transactions yourself go back to when
[18:36] you discovered Bitcoin right you know
[18:39] what was the very first wallet or uh
[18:42] that you used for for Bitcoin for your
[18:45] very first transaction a ledger okay so
[18:48] use Ledger right now if you if you
[18:50] bought a ledger and you sent and you
[18:53] sent some Bitcoin to somebody else or to
[18:56] your you know another address that you
[18:57] have and cost you
[19:00] $100 you would be like do I really want
[19:03] to try this thing you know you would you
[19:06] know it would it and and also you're
[19:09] living in a kind of a uh you're living
[19:11] in a uh first world country right now
[19:15] imagine you're a person in El Salvador
[19:18] you know and you're like $100 is you
[19:22] know a week salary or whatever right
[19:25] you're not going to be you're just going
[19:28] to be like this is this is terrible I
[19:30] don't want to have anything to do with
[19:31] this thing so I just think it's it it's
[19:34] it does not make sense I understand why
[19:36] people are they've gone to that way of
[19:39] thinking um I do not think that it's
[19:42] needed for the security of Bitcoin I do
[19:46] not believe that is the case okay we
[19:49] have sufficient ex aash of of mining
[19:51] power right now Bitcoin is
[19:54] secure you know it we we the we do not
[19:58] need to feel sorry for these
[20:01] miners you know it's an intensely
[20:03] competitive business and even if half of
[20:05] them went out of business it wouldn't
[20:06] make any any change at all to the
[20:09] security of B of Bitcoin it's true and
[20:12] also like uh even like the the business
[20:15] is so fast growing like the the hash
[20:18] rate is going up like crazy in in the
[20:20] last couple years like if you see the
[20:21] chart in like the last five years how
[20:23] the hash rate is growing it's it's
[20:25] fascinating well I mean the yeah I mean
[20:28] it's going at it's growing kind of at
[20:30] the the 12th power of
[20:32] time so if you you know if you look at
[20:36] these power law models right uh it you
[20:39] know the price is going up relative to
[20:42] the six power of time so bitcoin price
[20:44] is going to the time measured uh from
[20:47] the you know from say 2010 right or 2009
[20:51] whatever you want to do for let's just
[20:53] say 2010 which is sort of the first
[20:56] prices of Bitcoin right so if you look
[20:58] at uh time from
[21:00] 2010 and uh and you know and you look at
[21:05] the price of Bitcoin it's gone up at the
[21:07] P time to the power six roughly if you
[21:11] look at hash rate it's gone up at the
[21:13] square of that so time to the power
[21:16] 12 and if you look at adoption it's sort
[21:19] of time to the power cubed roughly so
[21:22] there's there's a very
[21:24] clear kind of growth U model for coin
[21:28] with these power laws kind of you know
[21:32] they're
[21:33] not you
[21:36] know you can you could say they're kind
[21:38] of a religion I do think that they're
[21:39] rather amazing but there is a clear
[21:42] pattern of we've got this adoption
[21:45] that's leading to this price and that's
[21:47] leading to this hash rate for for the
[21:50] few people that might never heard of the
[21:52] power I feel like right now most of them
[21:55] heard about it but what is it and why is
[21:57] it so in intriguing for you well it's
[22:01] the Intriguing thing is that
[22:05] um
[22:07] Bitcoin if you look at Bitcoin and
[22:09] you're just looking at it without
[22:11] looking at it in log log terms right if
[22:14] you're just looking at it normally your
[22:16] your narrative is this thing is very
[22:19] risky right and it goes up it went up a
[22:22] lot in 2018 or was 2017 it crashed in
[22:25] 2018 it went up a lot in 2020 it crashed
[22:28] in
[22:29] 2022 uh now it's back up like it just
[22:32] seems completely volatile right like why
[22:35] would there's no Rhyme or Reason to this
[22:37] thing it goes up it goes down it crashes
[22:39] now if you look at it on a log basis
[22:43] where Bitcoin prices on log it looks
[22:45] like well it's going up but it's sort of
[22:47] like going up a little less fast and
[22:50] then if you look at it on a log log
[22:52] basis you're like oh wow this thing is
[22:53] kind of a line right it's going up in a
[22:56] linear fashion very predictably
[22:58] uh with actually sort of a reasonable
[23:02] volatility to it in log log terms so I
[23:05] think it's a it's it's an important um
[23:10] Discovery uh that uh that Bitcoin
[23:14] actually is is obeying this very sort of
[23:17] regular
[23:18] progression and um and this Italian uh
[23:23] physicist Giovani kind of first observed
[23:27] this and you know pointed it out and
[23:30] nobody cared and uh you know he he was
[23:33] sort of ignored and uh you know and he
[23:37] sort of uh one of one of the things I've
[23:39] tried to do is try to explain to people
[23:43] what he's what he did you know and so I
[23:45] sort of saying look you should give give
[23:48] the man some credit he found this this
[23:50] uh this incredible this incredible
[23:53] relationship and and since then there's
[23:55] been a lot of other people who have
[23:58] looked at at these laws and gone back
[24:01] and done the math and the analysis and
[24:03] the statistics themselves and they yeah
[24:08] there is this power law it really does
[24:10] exist and you know it it it's predictive
[24:13] and it gives you some sense of um where
[24:17] we where we where we're going Which is
[24:20] higher but also kind of what
[24:23] range what kind of confidence interval
[24:26] do we have in in like where it's going
[24:28] to be in 10 years right and so the power
[24:31] law tells you well we should be at
[24:33] roughly a million dollars per coin in 10
[24:36] years but you know we St some pretty big
[24:39] band around that right so we could be we
[24:42] might be at On The Low End
[24:46] 200,000 on the high end we might be at 2
[24:49] million right you know so that those are
[24:52] sort of some bands that you can look at
[24:54] the power law and you can get some idea
[24:57] of kind of like the range of outcomes
[24:59] and their likelihood you know if you
[25:02] just follow the statistics of this
[25:05] progression um and I I I do believe in
[25:08] that broadly I think it's it's really
[25:10] cool because um like I'm am full on
[25:13] bitcoin like I I I I just huddle and
[25:16] just buy in with whatever I got but I
[25:19] think it's useful to have models like I
[25:22] would not bad on it like I would never
[25:24] like oh I set it now like a higher bet
[25:27] because PA says like now in the next
[25:29] like few months we have a higher growth
[25:32] rate I would not bet on it but it's
[25:34] definitely useful to explain it and I
[25:36] feel like it's also a good guidance like
[25:38] you see like a little bit in the future
[25:40] very it's very broad though you say you
[25:42] can't it's not like it there's it
[25:45] doesn't tell you uh okay and now I'm G
[25:50] to buy a little bit more and now I'm
[25:51] going to sell some it's not like
[25:52] technical analysis right um it it really
[25:56] doesn't give you that level of uh
[25:59] of precision now you know if we got to
[26:02] say 200,000 in the next six months right
[26:06] let's say six to nine months the power
[26:08] law would tell you that you're at the
[26:09] higher end of the band right so you
[26:13] might it might be a sort of a an
[26:16] indication that you should take some
[26:17] money off the table you know we're we're
[26:20] kind of not there yet we're right we're
[26:22] kind of right in the middle of the the
[26:24] range uh but I it could tell you you
[26:28] know that um that maybe now is a good
[26:32] time to sell and you know it also did
[26:35] was very very accurate on the bottoms
[26:37] right so it's it's it's sort of like you
[26:40] know uh back in November of you know uh
[26:44] 2022 it was just like yeah you should
[26:47] just be completely all in you know
[26:50] 16,000 you know it it it really the
[26:53] bottoms are incredibly accurate the tops
[26:56] are less accurate well do you think uh
[27:00] could like if it could break this model
[27:03] what could it be like is is it like a
[27:04] giant like apple coming in like oh we
[27:06] buy 50% of our balance sheet like this
[27:09] year with Bitcoin is there something
[27:10] like that well look it could break on
[27:13] both directions right so it could break
[27:14] on the downside as well right so uh what
[27:18] could break it on the upside I think
[27:20] let's say the US declared Bitcoin legal
[27:24] tender you know that would be that would
[27:27] that would probably break it I think you
[27:29] know what I
[27:30] mean
[27:32] um uh you know I think at some point the
[27:34] US I think will declare a legal tender
[27:37] right I I just don't think but I for but
[27:40] for every one of those ifs there's
[27:42] another there's a there's a lot of thing
[27:44] Tendencies you know so you know look
[27:49] there's there's the good news is there's
[27:51] about I don't know it net net of the
[27:54] gbtc stuff there's about $16 billion
[27:56] dollar that have come into to the new
[27:59] ETFs which is great I mean it's on the
[28:01] high end of what everybody expected
[28:04] right but on the other hand it's still
[28:08] just a a very small fraction of the kind
[28:11] of money that's invested in the bond
[28:13] market you know um you know we we have a
[28:18] you know a hundred trillion dollar
[28:19] worldwide bond market um you know you
[28:23] know we're talking about a tenth of a
[28:25] percent going into Bitcoin you know so
[28:28] it's it's it's sort of small right and
[28:31] uh you know I started my my career in in
[28:35] in Wall Street and like e even back when
[28:38] I was on Wall Street these were small
[28:40] numbers you
[28:41] know the and they they've gone up 10x
[28:44] easily since you know so you know the
[28:48] there's so much money out there uh that
[28:51] most of the money is still on the fences
[28:53] it's just you know the just the very tip
[28:56] is coming into Bitcoin this point so you
[28:59] know there there's a there's a ton of
[29:01] money out
[29:03] there it's it's the it's sort of the
[29:05] reverse of the money printer right the
[29:08] the money printer goes Burr but where
[29:10] does that money end up it ends up like
[29:12] in bonds it ends up in you know uh it
[29:16] ends up in overpriced real estate it
[29:19] ends up in stocks at 35 times earnings
[29:24] that that are not that great you know so
[29:27] all this money is out there it you know
[29:30] it doesn't disappear there's a law of
[29:31] conservation of money right so this this
[29:34] money stays somewhere and so this money
[29:36] can come back into Bitcoin very
[29:39] easily um you would think right but it's
[29:42] you know the the there is this uh drag
[29:47] this there's there's this there's sort
[29:48] of a a resistance to change right and um
[29:53] you know so it's coming in slowly but at
[29:55] some point it I think it will it will
[29:58] will really happen um you know and I
[30:00] give you an example when I first when I
[30:03] was on Wall Street and I you know came
[30:05] in in the late 8s right stocks were not
[30:08] widely viewed as a place you wanted to
[30:11] invest right people would say you wanted
[30:14] to invest in bonds that that was the
[30:17] kind of conventional wisdom right and
[30:20] bonds at that point were yielding you
[30:22] know 10% right and so you could put your
[30:26] money and you could get 10% in the bond
[30:29] market wow that's good you know you
[30:30] could you could be a little less risky
[30:32] and you could put your money in treasury
[30:34] bills and you could get 8% right you
[30:37] know so um but you know why would you go
[30:41] and put your money in stocks that was
[30:43] that was a crazy idea right so you know
[30:46] fast forward you know 40 years later um
[30:49] not 30 30 plus years later right now
[30:53] everybody in their brother is in stocks
[30:55] right it's viewed as like completely
[30:58] natural thing they just bore your money
[30:59] in stocks you measure everything
[31:02] relative to the stock market and
[31:03] everything so in 30 years we've gone
[31:06] from yeah stocks are kind of in sort of
[31:09] interesting but they're risky too no no
[31:11] that's absolutely the right way to go so
[31:14] I think it may take 20 years really you
[31:17] know for people to start really
[31:19] embracing what Bitcoin can be it's it's
[31:21] not going to happen overnight um you
[31:24] know and and come places like apple
[31:27] they're they're conservative you know
[31:29] they're they're doing well they they
[31:30] don't want to upset the apple cart so on
[31:34] the other hand if Amazon does it then
[31:36] Apple has to do it
[31:38] right so you know there I I'm look I'm
[31:42] super enthusiastic for this stuff longer
[31:45] term but I also I you know and I also be
[31:48] I'm I'd be the happiest man on the
[31:50] planet if uh if the power law breaks to
[31:53] the upside
[31:55] right I'm not going to be like oh my God
[31:57] the is broken I hate life no I'm going
[31:59] to be like thank you you know so I I
[32:03] just I think the power law is pretty
[32:06] bullish right it says you're going to
[32:08] get to a million dollars in in 10 years
[32:11] uh that would be amazing by my you know
[32:13] by my account so know I think I I just
[32:17] think we should kind of tone back
[32:19] expectations a little bit as to the how
[32:22] fast the stuff actually
[32:24] moves and it moves quickly but um but
[32:29] perhaps not as quickly as some people
[32:31] would like it to
[32:33] move yeah there's this impatient in the
[32:35] human being coming out to feel like
[32:37] sometimes yeah we're all we're all you
[32:39] know we're just the worst uh we're we're
[32:42] the worst investors and we're our
[32:43] biggest worst enemies right and uh you
[32:47] know Warren Buffett you know even though
[32:49] he hates Bitcoin he is right about that
[32:52] you know it it all is about temperament
[32:55] right you know and if you have the right
[32:58] temperament you're willing to you know
[33:01] let things let good bets just sit for
[33:03] decades you're going to do extremely
[33:05] well and most of us are completely not
[33:09] not that built that way right I'm not
[33:12] built that way right so I'm I'm
[33:13] impatient myself and uh you know I think
[33:18] one of one of the things that I feel
[33:21] with Bitcoin is having kind of
[33:24] seen companies like Microsoft you know
[33:26] had you know I've had money and invested
[33:31] in companies like Microsoft but then
[33:32] sold my shares right or invested in
[33:35] apple and sold my shares Apple stock has
[33:38] been you know in terms of price movement
[33:43] you know it's gone up 100x from 20
[33:46] 200000 uh from the iPhone from 2008 it's
[33:51] gone up 100x it's not quite as much as
[33:54] Bitcoin but it's pretty remarkable right
[33:58] from Microsoft from the
[34:01] IPO it's gone up
[34:04] 3000x
[34:05] Microsoft you know so uh yeah and these
[34:09] are old kind of things but now we have
[34:11] Tesla and other things so there are
[34:13] growth stories and if you're if you're
[34:16] in if you're kind of in finance in
[34:20] Investments and stuff you you see these
[34:22] things long enough and you're just kind
[34:23] of like okay I can't miss the next one
[34:26] you know and so so and you know you
[34:29] first have to identify it that's usually
[34:31] the easy thing right the hard thing is
[34:34] not taking your money off the table
[34:36] that's the hard thing you know because
[34:39] there's some something somebody says uh
[34:43] Robin you know it's uh you know it's
[34:46] time to time to settle down you need a
[34:48] bigger house uh you got to think about
[34:51] those kids you know it's not all about
[34:53] Bitcoin and you're going to be like yeah
[34:55] okay I'll sell my bit I'll buy a house
[34:57] you know something like that you know uh
[34:59] so there's there's all these voices
[35:01] inside you some advisor is going to be
[35:04] saying well okay your Bitcoin is worth a
[35:06] lot of money now you should diversify
[35:08] you know I recommend this Diversified
[35:12] strategy and uh you know if you listen
[35:14] to that person you may sell all your
[35:16] Bitcoin
[35:17] right so and I don't even think this is
[35:20] a Bitcoin specific thing it's just a you
[35:23] know look right now Steve Balmer owns
[35:26] more has is a higher net worth than Mike
[35:29] Bill
[35:30] Gates because Steve Balmer just kept his
[35:35] Microsoft and Bill Gates Diversified
[35:38] into farmland and you know medical stuff
[35:42] and whatever but Steve balber just kept
[35:44] his bit his uh
[35:47] Microsoft and so now he's worth more
[35:49] than Bill Gates so I definitely think
[35:51] that time in the market is really
[35:54] important here uh and so you know
[35:57] congrat congratulations you know you
[35:59] you've identified Bitcoin as a winner
[36:02] now let's see if you can hold on not
[36:05] even do anything different not even like
[36:07] add to what you're doing but just hold
[36:09] on you know to what you got you know
[36:12] that that I think is the that that's the
[36:14] challenge we all face right thank you
[36:16] you already made it halfway through the
[36:18] video and I'm really really grateful to
[36:20] have you here two things make this
[36:22] channel possible you as a watcher and
[36:25] listener who keep supporting this
[36:27] channel and another one is all the
[36:29] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[36:31] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[36:34] very start and where I personally buy my
[36:36] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[36:38] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[36:40] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[36:43] simplest and securest way to secure your
[36:46] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[36:48] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[36:51] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[36:54] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[36:57] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[37:00] and you know your friend does not have
[37:01] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[37:03] he needs a birthday present and a small
[37:05] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[37:07] 5% off your order plus you support my
[37:11] channel and now let's get back to the
[37:13] video the the doing nothing part is the
[37:15] hard one yeah I mean I come I come from
[37:18] the stock world and I was really big on
[37:21] Tesla I mean like 1,100% or something
[37:24] like that and actually fronted
[37:26] everything then in in into Bitcoin like
[37:28] I did that before with other stocks uh
[37:31] then I went all in in Tesla and now I'm
[37:33] Bitcoin I mean both Tesla and Bitcoin
[37:35] did kind of well since then but uh it's
[37:39] it's it's hard to stay on one thing like
[37:42] not to get excited about other things
[37:44] like just stay that and I want to get in
[37:46] this because you have done a lot in your
[37:49] life you have done uh with MAF you have
[37:51] Wall Street with all the things that you
[37:53] have done in life um what maybe
[37:56] connected with that some Strate which is
[37:57] some some learnings that you have that
[37:59] you are now getting into with Bitcoin
[38:02] well I mean first of all I think math is
[38:05] a great subject that if if you're going
[38:08] to college or something I always tell
[38:10] people like take take a lot of math
[38:12] right and uh and the reason I say it is
[38:17] you never know when you're knock when
[38:19] you're going to be able to use that math
[38:21] or that way of thinking right so um you
[38:25] know uh I think you know it's not
[38:28] directly applicable nothing you do is
[38:30] directly applicable right but I've
[38:32] noticed that math people can think about
[38:34] problems really quickly and they
[38:38] understand they understand these
[38:39] problems quantitatively much better than
[38:41] other people so I think math is a great
[38:44] kind of tool to help form your brain uh
[38:47] about things so I I I I love math and
[38:50] I've used math throughout my entire life
[38:52] you know whe whether I'm you know
[38:55] working on some advertising thing or
[38:58] anything else I always I always look at
[38:59] life very
[39:01] mathematically
[39:03] um you know I think the
[39:06] uh uh you know learnings about life in
[39:11] general um you know I think it a lot of
[39:13] everything is timing right so uh you
[39:17] know it's sort of you got to be at the
[39:19] right place at the right time now at the
[39:21] right place might be you know in Bitcoin
[39:24] right when bitcoin's going right it
[39:27] might be being in Stanford right in the
[39:30] 80s you know when kind of like you walk
[39:33] around and you know you see the laser
[39:35] printer being invented or you see the
[39:37] you know the Xerox Park that led to the
[39:40] the the Mac right uh so you sort of
[39:43] you're just around things when they're
[39:45] percolating that they're percolating
[39:47] somewhere and so being in being in the
[39:50] right place at the right time is really
[39:52] important so that keeps on changing
[39:55] right so I would say right now what's
[39:58] the most interesting sort of thing
[40:01] that's happening in the world by far is
[40:03] artificial intelligence right that's
[40:07] that's probably the thing that's going
[40:09] to change our lives the
[40:12] most um and over the next 20 years you
[40:16] know and uh so I would say focus on the
[40:20] higher order bit which is what what is
[40:23] the thing that's going to change the
[40:24] world the most and I was say right now
[40:28] it's probably AI is number one and
[40:30] Bitcoin is number two that's that's what
[40:33] if I had to rank them now as far as an
[40:36] investment unfortunately I don't think
[40:38] you can just invest in AI right that's
[40:41] because we don't have there's no
[40:43] clear you know you can invest in Google
[40:46] they're doing some AI you know you can
[40:48] invest in Microsoft they're doing some
[40:50] AI but it's not clear who's going to you
[40:53] who's going to win AI it's just not
[40:55] clear right um um just like in the
[40:59] internet you know if you ask people who
[41:01] is going to what's the best internet
[41:03] play at probably a lot of investors
[41:07] would have said
[41:08] Cisco right because they make the they
[41:12] make the routers right that everybody
[41:14] needs in the internet so that would have
[41:17] been sort of the consensus play right so
[41:20] Nvidia right now is sort of the
[41:21] consensus play for AI but it's not clear
[41:25] to me that you know the maybe the
[41:28] application layer on AI is really going
[41:30] to be it may you know maybe it's really
[41:32] chat GPT just ends up becoming you know
[41:36] the AI play for the next 20 years we
[41:39] don't know right I would probably bet on
[41:42] chat GPT right right if I if that was a
[41:45] public company I would want to own that
[41:47] company right just because I it does
[41:49] feel to me like that's the next Google
[41:52] but you never know right so you know
[41:53] it's it's it's a hard one to handicap so
[41:56] I think from an investment perspective I
[41:58] like Bitcoin from what's going to change
[42:00] the world AI is going to change the
[42:03] world you know it's going to change the
[42:04] world the most because if we if we can
[42:07] have uh machines that think and machines
[42:11] that can build factories you know you
[42:14] know like if a machine can decide how to
[42:16] build the next Tesla Factory you know
[42:20] like what what are we needed for exactly
[42:23] not not clear that we have any role at
[42:25] all right just you know just kind of
[42:28] entertain us produce produce movies for
[42:31] us to watch I don't know you know but
[42:34] it's uh you know I I think it's AI is
[42:37] something as significant as the
[42:40] Industrial Revolution you know and we're
[42:43] kind of the we're kind of the uh you
[42:46] know the city dwellers of of Europe in
[42:49] the 17 the early 17 or 1600s you know
[42:54] and you know yeah they they can make
[42:56] porcelain and stuff like that but they
[42:58] don't have the steam engine you know and
[43:01] then all of a sudden now we have the
[43:02] ability to make you know yarn and we you
[43:07] know we we can make clothes and we have
[43:09] these you know this we can make we have
[43:10] cars and we have you know so to me that
[43:14] was the first major things the
[43:16] Industrial Revolution now now we have we
[43:19] sort of had the information revolution
[43:21] but that is not as big as the ability to
[43:25] have machine that think and I think
[43:29] machines that think is it's going to
[43:31] change absolutely everything and and
[43:34] that's probably how it looks I did not
[43:36] think that would happen in my
[43:38] life um you know it was and when I was
[43:42] at Stanford I was uh is is interesting
[43:46] because I actually have a
[43:47] paper uh a published paper in
[43:51] AI uh from 1986 yeah in the i e
[43:55] transactions of uh
[43:57] artificial intelligence and pattern
[43:59] recognition so I was I was dealing with
[44:03] sort of Tom cover in the stats and
[44:06] information the science department at at
[44:10] uh Stanford and we were talking a lot
[44:12] about AI in the time and um it was it
[44:17] just it didn't seem like it was going to
[44:20] really work right what but there were
[44:22] certain ideas of machine learning right
[44:25] even back in the 80s you know
[44:27] it just didn't really seem like it
[44:30] thought maybe this approach is not going
[44:31] to work
[44:33] right and so you know and I've you know
[44:37] for the last 30 years I've been sort of
[44:39] bearish I sort of think I it'll never
[44:41] happen they'll never be able to
[44:43] understand talk would never have chat
[44:45] GPT in my life you know and so to me
[44:50] this is absolutely magic that that it
[44:53] that it's that that's already where it
[44:55] is and you know I I think where it's
[44:58] going to be in 5 years it's going to
[45:00] it'll change everything right it will
[45:03] absolutely change everything so I think
[45:06] it's that's a really positive thing and
[45:08] if I was you know advising a young
[45:10] person right now you know and I have um
[45:13] a son who's about to you know he's going
[45:15] to go to college here after next you
[45:17] know and I'm I'm sort of like like you
[45:18] need to whatever you do you can be on
[45:21] the business side of it you can be
[45:23] wherever you are but you need to realize
[45:26] how AI is going to impact the world
[45:28] right there's you don't have to
[45:31] necessarily be a coder right you could
[45:34] you can be any there's but there's you
[45:37] want to be around that right you want to
[45:39] be you want to be
[45:42] around that that level of that Nexus of
[45:46] of uh excitement and if you're around
[45:49] that you're going to do very well right
[45:53] and you're going to have a very
[45:54] rewarding life I think so I think
[45:57] that's what I would do I would just I
[45:59] mean I know I would probably just be
[46:02] completely engaged in AI right now um
[46:05] but you know it it it's it's something
[46:09] that's fine to look at too and just sort
[46:11] of observe and maybe you have something
[46:14] that you can add or somehow with the
[46:17] area that you're getting involved in but
[46:19] it definitely feels to me like we're
[46:21] gonna we're going to be on some kind of
[46:23] hockey stick with
[46:25] AI very soon you know and I just have
[46:28] absolutely no idea where it's
[46:30] going you know like the the idea that
[46:33] Elon Musk can say that there's going to
[46:34] be two
[46:36] humanoids per human two robots per human
[46:40] is just insane to me but it you know
[46:43] it's probably accurate you know I you
[46:46] know we probably towards the end of my
[46:48] life I will have a robot that does the
[46:51] dishes you know you know and and that
[46:54] you know can can run errands for me you
[46:57] know go to the store and get me some
[47:00] milk you
[47:01] know and the robot will just walk out
[47:03] the door and and start running to the
[47:06] store and come back with a some milk I I
[47:09] I I definitely think that's not without
[47:12] in the you know that's that will happen
[47:15] now you know that we are going to live
[47:18] that world right we are going into
[47:20] complete science fiction here uh as long
[47:23] as we don't implode and we you know
[47:25] sound money is kind of the
[47:27] you know one of the requirements I think
[47:29] for for doing this is we we have to have
[47:33] a system that is um that doesn't have
[47:36] you know can't can't be a a leaky bucket
[47:39] you know where things are just you know
[47:41] there's we we we just need to have sound
[47:44] money you
[47:45] know um and uh if we have sound money
[47:49] and we have ai it's going to be an
[47:52] incredible Prosperity I think so you
[47:55] know I think I think we're going to be
[47:56] in a massively bullish scenario and as
[47:59] long as long as we don't blow ourselves
[48:01] up with nuclear weapons too but you know
[48:04] we we have that we have that small thing
[48:07] to overcome what do you think is is the
[48:09] intersection of of of Bitcoin and EI
[48:12] will will yeah use Bitcoin to transact
[48:14] from machine to machine it's like yeah I
[48:17] mean it's it's going to have to use some
[48:18] version of wrapped Bitcoin right so and
[48:22] that's why I'm you know people say Fred
[48:25] you rap Bitcoin bad no I'm like no it's
[48:27] it's probably what you want right you
[48:29] want to have some kind of wrapped
[48:30] Bitcoin you know let's just
[48:33] say I'm not going to say I'm endorsing
[48:36] salana here okay but I'm not because I
[48:38] don't and I own no salana or anything
[48:40] but like if you had a wrap Bitcoin on
[48:42] salana that you could 100% trust right
[48:46] that you know not that you could just
[48:48] audit it but that you know that it's
[48:51] like you could audit it every second
[48:53] okay that you know that your your
[48:56] Bitcoin was segregated somehow and you
[48:58] have all these you had all these these
[49:02] points that gave you a very high
[49:04] confidence that that your your Bitcoin
[49:06] wasn't going to be taken away well if if
[49:09] that was the case and you could come in
[49:12] use your wrap Bitcoin for transactions
[49:15] right and then the minute you're done
[49:17] with it unwrap it and put it back in you
[49:19] know your Vault then great that works
[49:23] you know conceptually that works right
[49:25] you can you're going to exit execute
[49:27] something very very quickly right pretty
[49:30] much that in seconds you know or
[49:32] fractions of a second right with very
[49:35] little slippage very low fees right fees
[49:39] will
[49:40] be under a penny right to move things
[49:43] around maybe under a hundredth of a
[49:45] penny right so very super low fees very
[49:48] very little
[49:49] friction but the unit of account is
[49:52] Bitcoin that's what we should fight for
[49:54] you know we should fight for the unit of
[49:56] account being Bitcoin not the dollar
[49:59] right so you know if the unit of account
[50:02] is Bitcoin and then ultimately gets
[50:04] swapped back for a real Bitcoin I'm
[50:07] happy you
[50:08] know uh that will solve everything
[50:11] because then it'll be okay great I can I
[50:14] can send Bitcoin super quickly whether
[50:16] it's me sending it to you or whether
[50:18] it's my machine sending it to your
[50:20] machine you know and uh but that we have
[50:24] complete Redemption on demand uh for the
[50:27] real thing and I can do that every hour
[50:30] every day whenever I want right that's
[50:33] sort of I think the best best of all
[50:35] worlds right and I think once we have
[50:38] that kind of layer yeah machines are
[50:40] going to use it all the time right and
[50:42] they're going to charge
[50:44] microtransactions it it's going to be
[50:46] integrated everywhere right so uh I do
[50:51] think that that's likely to happen I
[50:53] think the main thing we need to get is
[50:55] we need to get
[50:57] sort of first of all we need to get
[50:59] Bitcoin price higher because that's it's
[51:01] a this is not going to happen if Bitcoin
[51:05] is still competing with the dollar with
[51:07] stable coins like we we have to I tell
[51:11] people like these stable coins are just
[51:13] this they're not a long-term thing you
[51:16] know this is just a transition like you
[51:19] know we we got to get it so Bitcoin is
[51:21] already what everybody
[51:23] wants and then the then the question is
[51:26] oh I need to get it cheaper to
[51:29] transact and I think I think we're going
[51:31] to get there you know over the next over
[51:34] the next decade I think it'll be very
[51:35] clear 10 years from now that yeah I
[51:39] don't I don't really want US Dollars
[51:41] anymore or Euros digital you know
[51:44] they'll have them but I won't nobody
[51:46] will want them I think in 10 years and
[51:49] then it'll be like okay I need to get
[51:51] some Bitcoin to you really fast how do I
[51:53] do it that that that'll be that'll be
[51:55] the the the thing you ask you know I
[51:58] want to buy this book I'm I'm going to
[52:00] send it I'm going to give you I'm going
[52:01] to pay you some Bitcoin great done you
[52:04] know how do I do it to you lightning if
[52:06] that that works great if there's
[52:08] something else that works better great
[52:10] but it it better be like 100% have
[52:14] 100% success rate like right now
[52:17] lightning is not it's not there and I'm
[52:20] not completely convinced it'll get there
[52:23] I'm I'm a fan of lightning but I'm I'm
[52:27] not I'm not uh 100% a believer that
[52:32] we're going to get that lightning is
[52:34] going to scale to where we need it to
[52:36] scale with the system that that it has
[52:39] David Marcus May disagree with me get
[52:41] him to on your show you know I'd love
[52:44] for him to to kind of update us all on
[52:46] you know on this stuff and and you know
[52:48] we really need governments
[52:51] to we need governments to uh as you said
[52:56] we we can't have the taxation of this we
[52:59] can't a small Bitcoin transaction should
[53:01] not be taxable right we shouldn't have
[53:05] to report that you know I'm buying a you
[53:08] know a movie ticket with Bitcoin so we
[53:11] we have to figure out the taxation part
[53:13] of it and the reporting parts of it and
[53:15] the money laundering you know kyc parts
[53:19] of it we
[53:20] can't I think Bitcoin is fundamentally
[53:23] not compatible with kyc to me that that
[53:26] that's interesting because like there
[53:28] like I don't know where is like where
[53:31] you are but in in austrial like there
[53:33] it's gets hard and hard to get no KC
[53:36] Bitcoin I mean you get always like when
[53:38] you just meet up with people that like
[53:40] apps like vexel V can write people like
[53:43] hey do you want to exchange something uh
[53:45] but all the exchanger like they even do
[53:47] your taxes for it now like if you have a
[53:50] exchange you they do the taxes for you
[53:53] and stuff like that so like KBC is I
[53:56] don't like it uh but it's it seems like
[53:58] more and more like the standard for
[53:59] Bitcoin it's like the maybe it's just
[54:01] because we're in a transitioning time
[54:03] now well look I'm I'm sort of of the
[54:06] opinion look I think a person to really
[54:09] follow here is Eric Vorhees right and
[54:13] you know look first of all kyc doesn't
[54:15] work it's completely and utterly useless
[54:18] thing it's not preventing anything it's
[54:22] not doing anybody any service it's not
[54:25] it's not stopping it's not doing
[54:27] anything right the only thing it's doing
[54:29] is making Bitcoin transactions more hard
[54:32] for people that's all it's doing it's
[54:34] like this layer that's just designed to
[54:38] make Bitcoin less usable that's it so I
[54:42] really don't think we need kyc I I would
[54:45] I mean I would debate with anybody
[54:47] Elizabeth Warren whatever I don't care
[54:50] but I I just don't think it's it's
[54:52] actually useful you know we should not
[54:55] care um you know if somebody's
[54:58] transferring some Bitcoin does not need
[55:01] to go through we don't have to have
[55:03] somebody checking whether you're a
[55:04] criminal it's it's fine we we have to
[55:07] have free and open money and that by the
[55:09] way was exactly what Satoshi created
[55:13] bitcoin for right it's peer-to-peer you
[55:17] know it doesn't me it's not peer-to-peer
[55:19] with a kyc in the middle it's
[55:21] peer-to-peer you know I can send you
[55:24] some money and and the you know
[55:27] Christine lagard is not in the middle of
[55:29] that transaction you know and I can send
[55:33] it to you or I can send it to you know
[55:35] your cousin who happens to be in Iran
[55:39] right it should you know when a when a a
[55:43] bird flies across a border it doesn't it
[55:46] doesn't stop at Customs you know just
[55:48] flies across the border so we have to be
[55:52] in this fluid world where there's this
[55:54] thing called money which is Bitcoin
[55:57] which doesn't care about borders you
[55:59] know which is completely
[56:02] neutral um and
[56:05] uh yeah and we shouldn't be doing these
[56:08] sanctions right to places like Russia if
[56:10] you don't like Russia there's other
[56:12] place other ways to fight Russia right
[56:15] like if you want to fight Russia
[56:16] actually go fight them on the terrain in
[56:18] Ukraine go with guns you
[56:21] know uh but the idea of like sanctioning
[56:25] Russian bank accounts and stuff is wrong
[56:27] like we should money should be this
[56:30] neutral
[56:31] thing that um that these governments
[56:35] should stick out get get away from this
[56:38] you know and uh I know it's it's very
[56:41] hard because they want they want to be
[56:43] in control right and there's this huge
[56:46] tendency for them to be super in control
[56:48] like in China right where they can say
[56:51] I'm sorry you said something bad on uh
[56:54] social media so you can't can't actually
[56:56] use the train anymore your train
[56:58] privileges have been revoked I'm sorry
[57:01] right but to me that's just the worst
[57:04] thing that could happen right is that we
[57:07] have government is now it's it's really
[57:10] something out of like um Brave New World
[57:13] or 1984 right where the the governments
[57:16] have just become so powerful that they
[57:19] can tell you they can reach right into
[57:20] your bank account and steal money from
[57:22] you and so I I think you
[57:27] know as as as something that we need to
[57:30] get go forward and we need to have
[57:32] sovereignty of our own money and I think
[57:35] that has to be at a worldwide level and
[57:37] I think we should that money can be
[57:40] should be movable wherever we want and
[57:43] to whoever we
[57:44] want and you know we we have to stop
[57:48] fighting that movement you know we
[57:50] should not try to fight the fact that
[57:53] some money might move to a place that
[57:55] you don't like it
[57:57] too like let's take politics out let's
[58:00] just make it you know the internet
[58:02] doesn't care it's just bits right and
[58:05] cryptography is just bits and you know
[58:09] fighting it is first of all it's futile
[58:11] it doesn't work kyc doesn't work and so
[58:15] you're you're fighting a losing battle
[58:17] already with this so so just give up on
[58:20] that battle embrace the future Embrace
[58:25] Bitcoin
[58:26] and we're all going to be better by
[58:28] doing that and then you know you can
[58:30] have other ways of of of fighting these
[58:33] problems you don't need to fight them
[58:35] that way and that that's why I'm I think
[58:38] I'm very sort of in general in favor of
[58:40] less government
[58:42] intervention you know less less big
[58:45] government I think you know I think
[58:48] Europe is it's it's it's very
[58:50] unfortunate in my opinion what's
[58:52] happened in Europe you know and I I grew
[58:54] up in Europe so I grew up in France
[58:57] and um you know and I just see this this
[59:00] in government's just gotten bigger and
[59:02] bigger and bigger and bigger and now we
[59:05] have this monster of
[59:08] Brussels and the European Union and it's
[59:12] just it's insane it's just like like
[59:15] we've we have just this it's the worst
[59:18] of all worlds right we've just created
[59:20] this monster and this this additional
[59:23] regulatory body that as if we didn't
[59:25] need
[59:26] as if we really needed another
[59:28] regulatory body now we have this
[59:29] European Union regulatory body and so I
[59:34] I think it's just a very bad system and
[59:37] I think it's it's going to break I I
[59:40] definitely think this European system
[59:43] will break and I think it's it's we're
[59:45] starting to see that now you know with
[59:48] these right-wing governments and stuff
[59:49] and brexit and everything I think
[59:51] European system is going to break and it
[59:53] just it's not going to continue and and
[59:56] you know probably 20 30 years from now
[59:58] Europe will not exist in the in the
[60:00] sense that it exists right now that's my
[60:03] opinion I also see like that I was a
[60:06] really glowing European Union fan like
[60:09] when I was young and like I'm still
[60:10] young but like five years ago uh but
[60:14] with Bitcoin and the developments like
[60:16] the last like two three years that I've
[60:17] seen I'm really skepti of the European
[60:21] Union what they're doing and stuff like
[60:22] that uh they're doing small things
[60:25] really wrong uh the big things I'm not a
[60:27] fan of it's it's it's fascinating well
[60:30] look I mean I I've done I started a
[60:31] company in Germany uh in you know back
[60:36] in
[60:38] 2006 and you know we had ended up having
[60:41] a very good exit on this company um but
[60:45] you know so I know the German thing the
[60:47] ger Germany was was a pretty good place
[60:51] to be in 2010 you know what I mean and
[60:54] now look at Germany today okay I mean
[60:58] it's unbelievable I mean the industrial
[61:01] production's going down they're shutting
[61:03] down their nuclear reactors I I just
[61:05] don't it's just it's insane to me how
[61:10] how Germany has gone from the you know
[61:12] this engine of growth to I don't know
[61:16] they so I I'm not a fan I think
[61:21] uh
[61:23] yeah I definitely think that you can go
[61:25] wrong wrong it it's pretty easy to go
[61:28] wrong with with big government and uh
[61:31] and yeah I love Europe though I do love
[61:35] being in Europe and I go to Europe often
[61:37] and I I you know I think it's it's a
[61:39] great place to visit but I unfortunately
[61:42] I think they're doing they're making a
[61:44] lot of lot of mistakes you know that
[61:47] honestly the and we're making a lot of
[61:49] the same mistakes in the US so
[61:52] unfortunately where would you when when
[61:54] you have like no no family no connection
[61:57] no anchor points in any country and you
[61:59] are like a freedom loving bitcoiner
[62:01] where would you be in which country what
[62:03] what be the best place you think
[62:05] probably Singapore right now I mean you
[62:08] know it's sort of you don't have the
[62:10] complete freedom to do whatever you want
[62:13] right you know you can't you can't uh
[62:17] you
[62:18] can't you know necessarily chew gum and
[62:20] throw out your gum you might get you
[62:22] might get uh reprimanded for that pretty
[62:25] pretty bad but uh but look I think you
[62:27] know I think there's not any really
[62:29] great answer to that question right uh
[62:32] you know every every place has its
[62:34] drawbacks um but you know one of the
[62:36] good things about Bitcoin is you know
[62:38] you're you're you you do get you do have
[62:42] more options right if you if you get
[62:46] enough
[62:47] Bitcoin if if the your current place
[62:50] doesn't work for you you can find
[62:52] another place and uh you know that
[62:56] uh and I think that's going to be more
[62:59] the case uh in the future than not right
[63:02] I think you know there's going to be
[63:03] more
[63:04] countries let's say you have I don't
[63:06] know let's say you have 50 Bitcoin right
[63:08] and 10 years from now 50 Bitcoin will be
[63:11] worth 50 million bucks let's just say
[63:13] right I think you'll be able you'll have
[63:15] a very wide choice of um a places where
[63:20] you can go relocate with your 50 Bitcoin
[63:23] I think there would be a lot of people
[63:25] saying you come come to come to Iceland
[63:28] uh you know or would you like to come to
[63:31] Peru we have a we have special uh you
[63:33] know visas for Peru you know like
[63:36] whatever you want to do right so I think
[63:38] it gives you a lot of options and and
[63:40] you know and I think even moving Fiat
[63:44] money is not necessarily even that that
[63:48] easy right so you know it's just you
[63:50] know if you're European and you want to
[63:52] come to the US you know you're going to
[63:53] be filling out all kinds of forms and
[63:55] everything and so I'm I'm hopeful that
[63:59] we're going to have more of a fluid
[64:00] world in in the future uh and definitely
[64:04] you know having a lot of Bitcoin is kind
[64:06] of it gives you that sort of worldwide
[64:09] passport but you know you you'll be able
[64:12] to pick and choose some some good places
[64:14] to
[64:15] live one thing before we come to the end
[64:17] te that I thought about when you talked
[64:19] about KC do you also see a problem or
[64:23] like a threat to centralizing where
[64:26] coins are held like coinbase Bitcoin
[64:28] ETFs massive honey buts do you see this
[64:32] as a threat perhaps I mean uh I think I
[64:36] think we're still at the very early
[64:38] stages of um I mean look the ETF is you
[64:42] know what six months old so you know I
[64:46] think some of these things are going to
[64:48] they'll they'll diversify you know they
[64:50] just haven't done it now for they just
[64:53] wanted to this is they just have to
[64:55] submit something to the the SEC as to
[64:57] where they're going to be holding their
[64:59] coins um but uh you know I'm more we're
[65:03] going to get to more we're going to get
[65:05] to better Solutions than just having
[65:07] coinbase hold them it's not something
[65:09] that worries me right now today right I
[65:12] I don't think that that's a problem and
[65:15] you know you but you should probably
[65:16] diversify yourself you know if you're
[65:19] holding
[65:20] ETFs hold a couple different ETFs right
[65:24] buy the Fidelity ETF do their own self-
[65:26] custody you know also have you know the
[65:29] Black Rock ETF um I definitely think
[65:33] also we're going to get to so in-kind
[65:35] distribution of ETFs in in the next
[65:38] couple years
[65:40] so you know an ETF can be viewed as kind
[65:43] of a wallet in a way right so you know I
[65:49] I think that you know there's nothing
[65:51] quite like self-
[65:52] custody but self- custody also Al is you
[65:56] know it's it's somewhat tricky for most
[66:00] people um you really need to use
[66:03] multi-sig and what that really means is
[66:06] you really need to use a service like
[66:07] Casa or Unchained capital or relay I
[66:11] guess as and Switzerland does it um I'm
[66:14] not so so familiar with the European you
[66:17] know who does who does multisig in
[66:19] Europe who who does it in Europe multi
[66:22] good multi I mean you can also use uh
[66:24] car and an in in in Europe actually but
[66:29] uh there are like also services like the
[66:32] Bitcoin way and and and right I was
[66:35] thinking sort of European specific ones
[66:37] but but I I don't know specific
[66:39] Europeans yeah I mean those those those
[66:41] are those are both very good Services
[66:43] okay so um you know I I use Kasa myself
[66:48] for for for some of my Bitcoin and I
[66:51] also um I'm very familiar with unchain
[66:54] and I recommend it highly so uh uh and
[66:59] you know you should also have the
[67:00] founder of unchain well Dro you should
[67:03] get him on your show oh yeah definitely
[67:06] I had some I think two people already
[67:08] from unchain on but the founder was was
[67:10] not I definitely have to get you have
[67:13] man Trey cellos I think is his name okay
[67:16] yeah I for forgot that I wanna yeah yeah
[67:20] so look I just think it's you know the
[67:23] problem is when when you do these things
[67:25] yourself and you do them right it's you
[67:28] know at some point you're you you do
[67:30] have to trust the other party like you
[67:33] have to trust Costa are Unchained all
[67:35] their processes and everything they're
[67:37] probably not going to ever lose your
[67:39] Bitcoin but you know you know if if
[67:43] Unchained went their website went dark
[67:45] you know all of a sudden you know you as
[67:48] a you as a uh unchanged customer you
[67:52] would be like what what what happened
[67:54] where's my money and even though you
[67:56] probably have a way of recouping it and
[67:58] everything it'll cause you probably a
[68:00] minor heart attack that day right so uh
[68:05] you know I don't know it seems to me
[68:09] that for for most people the ETF is
[68:11] going to be the ultimately the best
[68:13] solution and what you really want is you
[68:15] want this in kind distribution right so
[68:18] that if you want to move it out of the
[68:19] ETF into Bitcoin you don't have to move
[68:22] it into cash and then buy the Bitcoin
[68:24] you just go ETF to bitcoin very easily
[68:28] in and out right and so I think that's
[68:30] going to happen in the next 24 months
[68:33] we're going to have uh you know we will
[68:37] have in kind distribution for
[68:39] ETFs um and and at that point I mean
[68:44] that's going to be huge engine of growth
[68:46] for ETFs as well right because if you
[68:48] can use these ETFs is kind of like if I
[68:50] can go and move five Bitcoin over to
[68:54] ibit now I have I have you know would be
[68:57] about be 100 let's say it's like uh
[68:59] 30,000 shares of ibit right if I go
[69:03] here's five Bitcoin I'm changing it for
[69:04] 30,000 shares of ibit and then back and
[69:07] forth and I can do that then why do I
[69:10] really need self custody I you know I
[69:12] mean I can I don't you know I mean I
[69:14] don't need I could just have a ledger
[69:16] and just move move it back and forth
[69:18] with my ledger and you know I don't
[69:21] really I could use ibit for most of my
[69:24] stuff or whatever Fidelity or whatever
[69:26] it is for most of my Bitcoin and then I
[69:28] can move it back easily onto onto a
[69:31] ledger and I think that's almost the
[69:33] best of best of all worlds right um and
[69:38] so it's a it I think that's so I think
[69:41] I'm very bullish on these ETFs I think
[69:43] they're going to be they're going to be
[69:45] we haven't seen anything yet I think the
[69:47] it's it's just going to grow like crazy
[69:50] and uh and and it's going to be look
[69:54] it's this is going to be the the thing
[69:55] that black rock did that is going to be
[69:57] that's going to be their main thing is
[69:59] this this IIT that's it's going to be
[70:02] like spy or QQQ right I mean it's just
[70:05] this is gonna this will be this is how
[70:08] most people are going to get into
[70:11] Bitcoin they're going to buy this ETF
[70:13] that's what they're going to do most
[70:15] people um so it's it's but I also think
[70:20] that you know it it it'd be great if
[70:23] over the next couple years we we put
[70:25] push for Bitcoin usage so even if it's
[70:28] not even if it's small I do love the
[70:32] fact that people are using their ledgers
[70:34] or even their mobile wallets or whatever
[70:36] it is right but just get getting to use
[70:39] Bitcoin I'd love I'd love to push that
[70:41] so I you know I'm part of part of one of
[70:45] the things I would like to do is and I'd
[70:47] encourage you to do it too which is uh
[70:50] promote the actual use of Bitcoin you
[70:52] know so I was sort of sort of half
[70:55] joking but not really half joking I said
[70:57] like if somebody wants to sponsor me and
[70:59] give me a stake I'll just sell you know
[71:02] and they accept beef for Bitcoin I'll
[71:05] Grill the Bitcoin the steak I'll taste
[71:07] it I'll tell you how good it is and I'll
[71:09] send them to their website you know and
[71:11] you know I think it's I think that's
[71:13] something we can do you know uh I think
[71:17] it's a very good thing that people
[71:19] actually play around with Bitcoin a
[71:21] little bit more and buy stuff with it
[71:24] and get get you using it and it's not
[71:26] going to impact the price of Bitcoin the
[71:28] price of Bitcoin is going to be for
[71:30] savings and everything but I do think
[71:32] it's I think it's part of the thing is
[71:34] using Bitcoin you know
[71:37] so so I I I get paid from some of my
[71:41] sponsors in Bitcoin are there you go
[71:44] that that's that's a really cool feeling
[71:46] from like a Bitcoin company sponsoring a
[71:48] Bitcoin podcast that they paying in
[71:50] Bitcoin who are some of your sponsors by
[71:51] the way I'm just curious uh I have uh
[71:54] bitbox I haveit way and I got also 21
[71:58] Bitcoin uh but they are just in Germany
[72:01] and Austria so we kind of it because my
[72:04] audience is mostly in America UK and
[72:06] Canada but those are like bitbox and and
[72:08] the Bitcoin way and there are some new
[72:10] ones coming out probably soon so Robin
[72:13] give me your uh send me your address
[72:16] also in your um your your phys physical
[72:19] address or a PO box and I will send you
[72:22] a copy of my book oh I would love to
[72:25] yeah I uh I I with my co-author I have
[72:29] two co-authors on this book one is Ben
[72:31] Sigman and then we have a designer Lee
[72:34] seens and we we put together a book and
[72:37] we uh we we sold out of the book but we
[72:40] kept uh we kept a 100 copies for for
[72:43] friends and family and other people and
[72:45] so I'll be happy to give you one but we
[72:47] sold out in uh in 13 hours and we sold
[72:52] 900 copies of this book at $200 a
[72:56] copy so we we took in we took in
[72:59] $180,000 in under 24 hours but we've we
[73:03] built this book and we sold out we're
[73:06] not sure what we're going to do from
[73:08] here but it's sort of it may just be a
[73:10] one-off that we just did this one book
[73:12] but um uh well we might do a second
[73:15] edition uh but it's it's it's a it's a
[73:18] coffee table book and um and I I hope
[73:22] you like it but we've we've gone through
[73:24] and we've inter interviewed a lot of
[73:25] people a lot of the
[73:28] ogs uh We've we've we've we've done a a
[73:31] ton of research and and I produced all
[73:34] these graphs and stuff and you know like
[73:36] charts and all that so but we tried to
[73:38] make a very beautiful kind of art
[73:41] book um so uh sort of like a toshan
[73:44] style
[73:45] book uh is it there a lot of visuals and
[73:49] andu incredible it's all visual it's not
[73:51] it's almost it's very little text so
[73:54] it's a very different so it's a a very
[73:56] different thing yeah so it started out
[73:58] as a it started out as almost like a
[74:01] regular textbook Tech video you know a
[74:04] lot of like every other book on Big C
[74:06] and then I started writing it and this
[74:08] guy Lee came to me and he's like look
[74:10] Fred you seem to have a lot of reach and
[74:13] and you're kind of disruptive on Twitter
[74:14] and I've been following you it's like
[74:15] would you consider doing a a different
[74:18] kind of format book because format
[74:20] really matters and I'm like yeah I think
[74:22] I would and then he goes well what do
[74:24] you think if we did sort of a coffee
[74:26] table book and it's like I'm this
[74:28] graphic designer I've done all this
[74:29] apple stuff and so I was like yeah I
[74:32] like I like this idea and so uh so we
[74:36] basically kind of reformatted everything
[74:38] and so we we've we've it's it's all
[74:41] pictures and uh yeah and it's just
[74:46] visual you know so so yeah so that
[74:50] that's what we did I I hope you like it
[74:52] but uh I'll get you a copy we don't we
[74:54] can't can't I can't give too many out
[74:57] but i' I'd love to have you and just you
[75:00] could show it to people in Europe and uh
[75:02] and so but you know we've got we've got
[75:04] we got a ton of ton of really
[75:06] interesting stories and stuff that we
[75:09] that we that we we got photos and stuff
[75:13] it's interesting I will share it and I I
[75:15] will also make like an a nicer Studio at
[75:19] one point to have something in the
[75:20] background and might just put it there
[75:23] some of the things so I hope you enjoy
[75:26] it you know we we we got a lot of uh
[75:29] there's a lot of stories from the really
[75:31] early days and it's like a friend of
[75:34] mine was the first person who invented
[75:36] proof of work so
[75:39] yeah uh she's a a researcher at uh IBM
[75:44] research uh San Jose and she came up
[75:47] with this original paper that she
[75:50] presented in 1992 that was the
[75:53] original paper uh her name was Cynthia
[75:56] dor and so she came out with this
[75:58] concept of it in 92 and uh and then Adam
[76:02] back came out with sort of a much more
[76:04] upto-date version of it in
[76:07] 1997 um so five years later yeah and so
[76:13] and and then you know David cha and we
[76:16] we talked at Cha and we had I had I had
[76:19] he made me lunch and we talked about you
[76:21] know because Nick Sabo used to work for
[76:23] cha you know
[76:25] so I I dug up and we we've talked to
[76:27] Sabo about this stuff and so yeah so
[76:31] really cool yeah so so yeah so that
[76:33] that's that's the book I hope you enjoy
[76:35] it thank you I appreciate that yeah
[76:40] perfect uh that's I think that's a it's
[76:42] a great ending point for the podcast
[76:44] great well thanks thanks for having me
[76:45] on and you know hello to the European
[76:48] bitcoiners yeah before I can let you go
[76:51] I have a small end routine where I have
[76:53] two questions the one is always same one
[76:55] for everyone and the other one comes
[76:56] from the previous guest um the one the
[76:59] first one is uh what can we learn from
[77:02] you besides Bitcoin I think uh take a
[77:05] look at my if you want to see something
[77:08] completely crazy you go to Fred Krueger
[77:11] do.org I put a website up and I have a
[77:15] ton of stuff there including my PhD
[77:19] thesis at
[77:20] Stanford uh if you if you want to look
[77:23] at just completely in
[77:25] insane research project I did
[77:28] on Arrangements of hyperplanes and de
[77:31] arrangements and uh random
[77:33] polyhedra that I did in
[77:36] 1986 and uh there's there's a lot of
[77:38] crazy stuff including some stuff on
[77:41] power law various other odit Oddities
[77:45] and mathematical things so there there's
[77:48] a whole bunch of stuff there on Fred
[77:49] Krueger and things that I find
[77:52] interesting and also people that I find
[77:54] interesting or videos that I find
[77:56] interesting and art that I find
[77:58] interesting so I just put it up there
[77:59] you can look at it so that that's me go
[78:02] to Fred krg.org just created it the
[78:04] other day amazing really cool I just
[78:06] looked at that cool
[78:08] website you click on the links there
[78:10] there's a page that says links and uh
[78:14] and you can see there's like all this
[78:16] stuff
[78:17] about distribution of Bitcoin addresses
[78:21] or how the amms work or the amm math and
[78:25] all this stuff so so I just put I just
[78:28] kind of like anytime that I I'm I'm
[78:30] seeing some something new that I like
[78:32] there um or or I even have like a list
[78:36] of all the bitcoiners that you can
[78:38] follow on Twitter and I rank them by uh
[78:41] the Krueger 69 wa the Krueger 69 yeah I
[78:45] think I'm number 42 I'm very
[78:47] quantitative so I measure everything so
[78:50] I was like okay well how do I stack up
[78:52] against everybody else so I'm I'm kind
[78:55] of currently about to hit 75,000
[78:58] followers um and so I kind of I kept
[79:02] track of that I even keep track of like
[79:04] how many how many you know how many
[79:06] followers per day I'm averaging and just
[79:10] like M just I'm a math guy I'm a nerd
[79:12] you know so it's just I I I track
[79:15] everything you know but yeah so you can
[79:18] look at that love that a lot it's really
[79:20] cool I also track it very closely this
[79:23] is more YouTube than Twitter
[79:25] uh but you should by the way you should
[79:28] uh you should definitely be more on
[79:30] Twitter too because I was the opposite I
[79:32] did Twitter only and not YouTube and
[79:35] then somebody somebody came to me and
[79:37] said uh Fred you should do YouTube as
[79:39] well and I was like okay I don't think I
[79:42] don't really have time for YouTube but
[79:43] then I then I started it and uh like
[79:46] yeah YouTube makes YouTube makes a lot
[79:48] of sense so I think there's there's one
[79:53] piece of advice to I would have to use
[79:55] also do Twitter also take your videos
[79:59] that you're doing on
[80:00] YouTube uh take the actual raw video put
[80:03] it on Twitter as well oh I do that
[80:06] actually
[80:07] yeah not like link to the YouTube one no
[80:10] no no it's it's actually like the the
[80:12] full video I put that on Twitter like I
[80:15] actually come I just say build build
[80:17] your Twitter
[80:18] up build your Twitter up the two things
[80:21] feed into each other and the way I look
[80:23] at it is the Twitter is kind of the
[80:26] newspaper or the radio
[80:28] show and uh YouTube is the library right
[80:32] so you know if I'm just going and I just
[80:35] sort of want to say okay what's new in
[80:36] the world
[80:38] today Twitter and that's what's new in
[80:40] the world today then is where was that
[80:43] one video of him interviewing sailor
[80:45] that's YouTube you know so so the
[80:48] library so the Robin S Library can be
[80:51] YouTube but I want I kind of want to see
[80:53] I kind of you got to develop a little
[80:55] bit more your Twitter personality or
[80:57] presence so absolutely you can do that
[81:01] and you can you can surpass me on
[81:03] Twitter I I would try abely absolutely
[81:07] fine I'm ha I'm happy to have some
[81:09] competition amazing I'm pretty good at
[81:11] I'm pretty good at Twitter though I'm I
[81:13] have to say I'm better competitively at
[81:15] Twitter but not because of uh um videos
[81:19] and stuff but I'm I'm I'm kind of witty
[81:22] so I come I'm I'm pretty good at like
[81:24] kind of putting these little words to
[81:26] they sometimes the really short tweets
[81:28] get more traffic than like long
[81:31] interviews and stuff
[81:33] so you know you just have to find the
[81:36] exact right little word to to put it's a
[81:39] game you know it's a game I'm not I'm
[81:41] not doing it to make money and my money
[81:43] is in Bitcoin you know that's that's I'm
[81:47] I'm fortunate that I've I've un
[81:49] fortunate that I've done pretty well in
[81:50] life and and I'm passionate about
[81:53] Bitcoin and
[81:55] uh you know and part of me is just
[81:58] trying to stay occupied and uh and and
[82:01] not and not lose the religion and uh you
[82:04] know it's all it's all a period so I
[82:06] think I think we're in a very good
[82:08] period for Bitcoin I think you know we
[82:11] won't always we'll have a crash we'll do
[82:13] we are GNA you know it's not going to be
[82:16] all roses but uh for now I think we're
[82:19] in a we're in a good we we've got we're
[82:21] the future right now is pretty bright
[82:23] for the next the next couple of years I
[82:26] think and could be really could be could
[82:29] be a we could be at the beginning of a
[82:30] five-year bullmark nothing says that we
[82:32] have to be in these fouryear
[82:34] Cycles in my opinion it could be like a
[82:37] 10year go Rush kind of a thing like this
[82:40] it could I think so well look I mean
[82:43] yeah these you know the the previous the
[82:45] fouryear cycle thing is like linked to
[82:48] these having the
[82:54] cycle just because we're like trained to
[82:57] have Cycles now but um you know I don't
[83:01] see any actual Supply demand reason why
[83:04] we have to go every four years crash 75%
[83:09] like no why you know like you know the
[83:12] stock market's gone up for you
[83:16] know it's it's pretty much gone up with
[83:18] with just a few crashes non-stop for 30
[83:21] years so you know could Bitcoin go up
[83:23] for 30 years I think so will there be
[83:25] some crashes yeah some point there going
[83:28] to be some crashes but yeah it's being
[83:33] mainly in Bitcoin is is a is is a it's
[83:37] kind of I think it's a good good place
[83:38] to be right now so um and I think we're
[83:42] going to do we're going to do fine we're
[83:44] going to do fine over the next five
[83:46] years so I'm super supportive of any
[83:49] anybody who wants you know anybody wants
[83:52] to inter get interview interview me or
[83:54] whatever um I'm you to the extent that I
[83:57] have the time I'm I'm certainly I love
[83:59] it I love that you open to that and and
[84:01] took the time also today uh come on Rob
[84:04] what was the other so that was it right
[84:06] yeah this was like the first question
[84:08] like I have an P it's uh uh where the
[84:11] previous guest is asking a question for
[84:12] the next guest without knowing who the
[84:14] next guest is it's it's really cool
[84:16] because it gives that like a new
[84:18] question um and we did not cover it till
[84:21] now um the question is for you how do
[84:23] you foresee the regul regulations
[84:26] politics and banks of the world playing
[84:28] a role in Bitcoin over the coming years
[84:31] especially now with the US elections I
[84:33] would really hope that they they do as
[84:37] little as possible um because I think
[84:41] the the opportunity for them to screw it
[84:43] up is really big um that that's that's
[84:47] what I would say and look I once you
[84:50] know I was involved in the domain name
[84:53] business with I can
[84:55] uh for years and years before before
[84:57] this and you know I once attended a uh a
[85:02] talk given by Bill Clinton and Bill was
[85:06] saying he goes you know when the
[85:08] internet came out we had to uh we had to
[85:12] decide because a l a lot of people were
[85:14] saying we should tax it you know like
[85:17] put a tax on
[85:19] email and because a lot of people were
[85:21] saying that you know and
[85:25] what yeah they were like look we have
[85:26] taxes on everything else why don't we
[85:28] have you know this is like postage it's
[85:30] going to put the post office out of
[85:31] business why don't we just have a small
[85:33] tax on every email you know like and so
[85:37] you know and tax and e-commerce and
[85:41] everything they they were they were
[85:42] really they were looking at this as a
[85:44] potential Revenue Source right and so I
[85:48] think that the you know if you're you
[85:52] know they say the expression if you're a
[85:53] hammer everything looks like a nail you
[85:55] know sorry if you're a nail everything
[85:57] looks like a hammer I don't even know
[85:58] the expression but but you you know if
[86:00] you're a regulator you want to regulate
[86:02] right so you really need to stop and
[86:06] think why do you want to regulate why
[86:09] does this thing need regulation okay and
[86:13] I'd argue it doesn't need regulation
[86:15] right it does not need to be
[86:18] regulated get your kyc hands off of it
[86:21] get you know just just hands off you
[86:25] know that that's that's what I would say
[86:27] and it's sort of like it's kind of like
[86:30] the internet when when the internet
[86:31] started it was not people were saying
[86:33] well this thing is going to be used by
[86:35] terrorists right it's going to be used
[86:37] by criminals and terrorists and
[86:39] everything
[86:40] else and uh and you know it is it is
[86:45] used the internet is used by terrorists
[86:47] right it doesn't mean that we should not
[86:50] have it right and is Bitcoin used by
[86:53] terrorists yes it is
[86:55] is Cash used by terrorists yes they are
[86:57] you know do terrorists use the french
[87:00] Paris Metro yes they do you know does
[87:04] that mean we have to kyc at the entrance
[87:06] of the metro to see that okay wait a
[87:08] second the terrorists can't go in this
[87:10] Metro no no you know so we have to be
[87:14] very careful about regulation
[87:18] because uh you know this stuff works
[87:21] when it's best when it's deregulated
[87:24] and I think in general in Europe they've
[87:26] just they piled way too much regulation
[87:29] you know they have regulation as to you
[87:31] know what you champagne is you know or
[87:35] what everything you know what the size
[87:39] of a a pen is you know like this is a
[87:41] standard European pen can only be this
[87:43] size and can have this type of ink and
[87:46] like we've got to get away from this
[87:48] regulation you know it's it's just not
[87:51] useful so I'm super anti-regulation
[87:54] uh I think you know we have to have some
[87:57] but we have to be very you should really
[88:00] think really hard about this regulation
[88:03] so especially with something like
[88:05] Bitcoin and it should not
[88:08] be anybody who says regulations good for
[88:11] a crypto or Bitcoin they're out of their
[88:13] mind is not good right it is not our
[88:17] friend is not it is not like people are
[88:20] like well it's going to help people
[88:22] investors no it won't you know it's it's
[88:25] not good people it's not people are not
[88:29] buying Bitcoin because it's
[88:32] insufficiently
[88:33] regulated that's not the reason why
[88:35] they're not buying Bitcoin that's that's
[88:38] that that there's other reasons but
[88:40] that's not the reason so that's very
[88:42] true yeah it's that's a good line uh
[88:45] that with the regulations yeah perfect
