[00:00] we have an issue with overspending in
[00:03] chat GPT 82% of the questions are
[00:06] Finance questions I think the question
[00:08] is what is money start talking about
[00:10] money with people with friends with
[00:12] everyone around you riding
[00:16] horses why do you think M Millennials
[00:19] especially are struggling with finances
[00:22] right
[00:22] now well thank you that's a great
[00:25] question um so I would say this year I
[00:28] started asking myself the question on um
[00:32] looking very closely to my friends's
[00:36] money habits um as I've been involved in
[00:39] the Bitcoin industry for the last three
[00:42] years I became very aware of my
[00:46] financial management Financial Planning
[00:49] and because if I wanted to invest in
[00:52] Bitcoin I needed to understand how much
[00:54] do I have available to invest this month
[00:57] um and why why am I investing this month
[01:00] more than the next one or Etc so I
[01:03] started looking talking more about money
[01:06] around me honestly and with friends I
[01:10] identify there like a lot of pain points
[01:13] in conversation with my friends they're
[01:14] all Millennials in their 20s living in
[01:17] Miami they're all graduated from school
[01:20] they all all have good careers which
[01:22] earn more than
[01:24] $100,000 a year um and they all struggle
[01:30] with finance and they're always
[01:31] struggling I'm like but why are you
[01:33] doing like I I understand that life can
[01:37] be expensive but I think it's it's about
[01:41] your money habits and it's about your
[01:43] mindset and how if you can you stick to
[01:47] budgets or not like or do you have a
[01:49] plan like start asking myself so many
[01:51] questions and I start doing this
[01:53] research I realized that even con
[01:57] including myself um
[02:00] we have an issue with overspending
[02:03] overspending comes to is a it's a
[02:06] behavior that comes to us by in many
[02:09] ways um by so like economic factors or
[02:13] social factors like it's so easy and
[02:15] convenient to buy things online today
[02:18] it's so easy to even make money today
[02:20] like as a freelance or you make money
[02:22] you think you can spend more uh so easy
[02:25] to go to these platforms where you can
[02:27] go invest uh in in Bitcoin in stocks
[02:31] like one day you go crazy and then the
[02:33] next day you feel guilty while like why
[02:35] did I do this and maybe I lose money and
[02:38] um you think that the Investments are
[02:40] bad is not the Investments maybe were
[02:42] your behavior so um all these pain
[02:46] points comes to how can we be better at
[02:50] sticking to budgets and really
[02:53] understanding our lifestyle and
[02:55] financial um uh state today but also our
[03:00] goals what are they so myself I started
[03:06] uh looking this problem in two ways so I
[03:10] go and sign up in Personal Finance
[03:14] Management apps like quick QuickBooks
[03:16] co-pilot spreadsheets like I normally
[03:19] use spreadsheets on at sale and I try to
[03:22] put all my bank accounts in one place
[03:24] cool I could do that in these tools but
[03:26] then after that these tools give me the
[03:28] data and that's it it's just numbers and
[03:31] I'm like but also they look so
[03:33] overwhelmed it's so like too much I'm
[03:36] like wait a second and when I try to go
[03:39] by categories I see that this category
[03:43] like says uh I buy I bought something in
[03:46] Target which actually was a medicine is
[03:49] under groceries no that's not under
[03:52] groceries that's under medicine or
[03:55] health um so I had to go through these
[03:58] tools and
[04:00] manually change this the categor the
[04:03] transaction categorization and do this
[04:05] over and over I got tired of it I was
[04:08] like I'm not being effective I'm keep
[04:10] spending money I asked my friends for
[04:13] more recommendations other tools they
[04:16] tell me rocket money they tell me means
[04:19] they tell me others I try them all and
[04:21] they still have all this problem all
[04:24] problems that I faced with the tools was
[04:26] like one they don't help me really to
[04:29] stick to to my budgets and even though I
[04:32] create budgets with them they don't
[04:33] really help me and also there's no
[04:37] guidance like there's no someone that
[04:39] helps me go and analyze these financial
[04:42] data that I'm having here so right so I
[04:45] look for a financial
[04:47] advisor and then a financial
[04:50] advisor took seven weeks to complete a
[04:55] financial analysis of the last three
[04:59] months of my expenses from all my bank
[05:01] accounts why because he did it with
[05:06] spreadsheets so he did it all manually
[05:09] and we have to go over together many
[05:11] times and it really stressed me out I
[05:14] asked my friends if they've done that
[05:16] before they all say they have bounced
[05:19] the process because they get anxious to
[05:22] see the data um because I guess people
[05:26] are scared about seeing their money
[05:28] habits which is normal I think we
[05:33] actually 83% of Americans in United
[05:36] States graduated from school without
[05:38] Financial education they all probably H
[05:42] there's um 73% of uh have uh student
[05:47] loan debt so people in their 20s my
[05:49] friends they all have student student
[05:52] loan debt so they already have de they
[05:54] probably got a car like me you also have
[05:57] a car Deb and you you are struggling
[06:00] because you really don't know what to do
[06:04] next after you see all this data from
[06:06] the tools basically that it is today
[06:10] so I realized this issue and uh
[06:15] basically I come up with that solution I
[06:18] started my own Journey as an
[06:21] entrepreneur again uh six weeks ago um
[06:26] starting my next week is my 7th but I'm
[06:29] counting every every week and I'm
[06:32] creating a software AI based platform um
[06:36] to help Millennials mainly people like
[06:40] me uh recently graduated in their 20s
[06:44] with a bachelor degree or uh maybe a
[06:47] another level degree student loan debts
[06:51] um they have they have understanding of
[06:55] importance of investment investing your
[06:57] money they have the importance of that
[07:00] they recognize they're aware that
[07:02] they're overspending because they're
[07:04] don't don't have the best habits um to
[07:07] stop overspending basically so this tool
[07:12] is going to help people um analyze their
[07:16] fi personal
[07:18] finance um so this is how it works one
[07:21] it connects all your bank accounts in
[07:23] one place that already exist we're using
[07:26] plate for this
[07:28] to you're going to chat with the name of
[07:30] the platform is
[07:32] felipa uh felipa is a girl is actually
[07:35] the girl that is suffering this problem
[07:37] so you chat with her she's going to read
[07:39] your financial data but she's going to
[07:41] ask you questions about your lifestyle
[07:45] goals and your financial goals such as
[07:48] get rid of debt or invest more in
[07:51] Bitcoin right and then and then maybe uh
[07:55] I want to buy a horse that's a lifestyle
[07:58] goal and
[08:01] so okay she gather all these data and
[08:04] then she create five what if a scenarios
[08:06] plans for you budget plans so based on
[08:11] what you're ready to spend your money on
[08:14] she's going to tell you listen you have
[08:16] these five different plans pick one that
[08:18] is going to help you reach your goals
[08:20] the plans uh um they uh change based on
[08:24] time so if you want to reach your goals
[08:26] faster you pick the let's say I want to
[08:29] get rid of my student loan depth in one
[08:31] year I picked that one it opens and the
[08:36] next step is she's telling you what is
[08:38] your budget on each of the categories
[08:40] that you already spend your money on um
[08:43] per month for one year and she also
[08:46] tells you hey if you accomplish that
[08:48] you're GNA pay off your student loan
[08:50] debt with this amount of money and
[08:53] you're going to be have invested in
[08:55] Bitcoin this amount of money so you
[08:57] already know the outcome of your
[09:00] behaviors and and and then what is going
[09:03] to happen she's going to give you
[09:04] virtual cards to stick to your budgets
[09:08] by categories so in restaurants you only
[09:10] have
[09:11] $300 and fitness you only have
[09:14] $200 for one year so you're not changing
[09:18] what you spend your money on you're
[09:19] changing how much you're spending on the
[09:22] M your
[09:23] money um and then it's also
[09:27] automatically set up so
[09:30] invest automatically pay off debt
[09:33] automatically and uh invest on your um
[09:36] pay your fits cost automatically as
[09:40] well and then the last part is felipa
[09:43] chat with you every morning every night
[09:46] she reminds you of your goals in the
[09:48] morning and she even give you examples
[09:50] like hey what about keeping $8 in a
[09:53] Starbucks today just that just $8 skip
[09:57] that and it's going to help you get
[09:58] closer to your goals um and then she day
[10:02] she reminds you and then you can chat
[10:03] with her and just get personalized
[10:06] insights of your financial
[10:09] data what is the outcome of all of this
[10:12] the outcome is that you're going to be
[10:14] able to save more money at the end of
[10:17] the day and invest more money at the end
[10:19] of the day my goal is to help people at
[10:21] my age to be more conscious about their
[10:23] money to improve their money habits to
[10:27] get rid of them if they want is a
[10:29] responsibility that probably they got on
[10:31] when they were young without having the
[10:34] maturity to understand that this will
[10:37] cost them like health
[10:40] issues and so they can invest more for
[10:43] their future invest more in Bitcoin like
[10:46] I I what my my goal would be guys you
[10:49] you need to now be a smart with your
[10:52] money go invest more in Bitcoin if if um
[10:57] and that's the way I'm going to be able
[10:58] to help me Millennials um to learn about
[11:01] Bitcoin as well
[11:03] so um I took this journey and I've been
[11:07] yeah so it's uh it's incredible how just
[11:11] by being part of the ecosystem and
[11:13] Bitcoin I
[11:15] learned uh I've been learning a lot
[11:19] of money in different ways and right now
[11:25] I'm learning that money habits is where
[11:27] everything starts and your mindset about
[11:30] money so I'm literally telling people
[11:34] money is a good thing to talk about the
[11:36] more transpiring that you are and
[11:38] vulnerable the more you're able to fix
[11:40] your problems and they're all fixable
[11:42] they're just
[11:43] numbers but the tools they're they're
[11:46] not there yet to closely help
[11:50] Millennials as as as I'm designing this
[11:53] tool for myself so if it was going to
[11:56] work for me it's going to work for a lot
[11:58] of others
[12:00] um so yeah and right now we're basically
[12:02] raising money and working with software
[12:05] development teams to build the first MVP
[12:08] of the product mean is a personal fining
[12:11] platform that shot down two weeks ago
[12:14] and they lose four million users uh like
[12:17] in two weeks and right now those users
[12:21] are also like out there um with no tools
[12:24] it's crazy and something interesting I
[12:27] found is in chat gbt
[12:30] um 82% of the questions of the
[12:34] conversations in GPT or fin Finance
[12:37] questions honestly wow yes so so cool
[12:41] right and I was like okay I guess people
[12:44] are trying to get help and you know um
[12:48] it's
[12:49] definitely yeah it's fascinating for me
[12:52] that uh we need those tools I think uh
[12:54] I'm I'm thinking a lot and this podcast
[12:56] is a lot around the problem like why is
[12:58] that like we you're 100% right there are
[13:01] so many people in debt there are so many
[13:03] people with spending problems you see
[13:05] people that have a good income then you
[13:07] see what they are actually having on a
[13:09] bank account and you're
[13:10] like where where did the money go right
[13:13] uh and this this problem of having bad
[13:16] money habits um I'm often thinking that
[13:20] it's rooted to the fear system where the
[13:23] high time preference uh is just not
[13:25] there yet uh I'm also wondering will
[13:28] that change on a Bitcoin standard if we
[13:30] have a hard money standard will that
[13:31] change I actually don't know like I
[13:34] think I hope that it changes
[13:35] automatically that we don't even need
[13:37] those tools those tools are great and I
[13:40] see a lot of uh friends uh and that are
[13:44] not in Bitcoin and struggl finance they
[13:47] have those apps so I this apps that you
[13:49] named they are ringing a bell in my head
[13:52] because not because I ever use them uh
[13:56] but because I have friends that's
[13:58] struggling with finances and they are
[14:00] using them and they are saying like they
[14:02] are actually helping me uh and I don't
[14:05] know what's the root cause of it I
[14:07] generally think the Fe system in
[14:10] itself highest the time preference and
[14:13] is the root cause of that and with
[14:15] Philipa that's a great way to mitigate
[14:18] that Bad feat monetary policy with an AI
[14:21] assistant that helps you basically do
[14:24] that as I understood it from your
[14:26] explain explanation I also hear it to
[14:28] dat first time um but that's that's
[14:31] really really cool so the the question
[14:33] for me for you would be now do you think
[14:36] uh on a full Bitcoin standard where we
[14:38] don't have feed money where there's no
[14:40] uh way to print money for governments I
[14:42] mean this would be way out like this is
[14:44] like 100 years uh uh few will we still
[14:48] need those tools will we do do people
[14:52] have those financial bad habit problems
[14:55] still on a sound money standard or is it
[14:59] just something or just something of the
[15:01] fear problem is it something that's
[15:03] rooted in just spend just uh increasing
[15:08] the money supply from the Federal
[15:12] Reserve
[15:15] so it I think
[15:19] um it's all
[15:22] about it's high time pre preference it's
[15:26] mindset right and it's
[15:29] education and being informed about the
[15:34] cost of your decisions
[15:37] so it doesn't matter that that what you
[15:41] spend like it doesn't matter what you
[15:44] spend on or how much but I think if
[15:48] you're consciously aware of why are you
[15:52] doing this
[15:55] more and be more intentional with your
[15:58] money
[15:59] then your money becomes back to you more
[16:04] in abundance as well and it comes back
[16:07] to you
[16:09] you it's like you feel more satisfied
[16:12] and instead of being afraid of spending
[16:17] your money on places or on things that
[16:21] tomorrow you're going to feel guilt
[16:24] because guilt what causes is people uh
[16:29] uh like B like overe eatings like uh
[16:32] eating bad e eating behaviors it causes
[16:35] more stress it causes more spending it's
[16:39] it causes uh reactions and at the end of
[16:42] the day Bitcoin is telling you telling
[16:45] us that we want to be free right we we
[16:48] want the freedom but not just the
[16:49] freedom financially it's the freedom of
[16:53] being happy it's like we want to be in a
[16:56] place that we are kind with each other
[16:58] respect each other we're happy with each
[17:00] other and
[17:01] also you're happy when all your areas in
[17:05] your life are more aligned and they're
[17:08] moving into the right direction so if
[17:11] you know that you if you made a con
[17:14] conscious decision about it's like food
[17:18] think about it so you eat you don't eat
[17:22] certain meat or centered type of meat
[17:26] because you know the consequences and
[17:28] you really care about it and you're
[17:31] intentional about the food that you
[17:33] going to eat so with money if you say
[17:36] I'm
[17:37] intentionally like putting my this money
[17:39] in this thing because right now my
[17:42] priority in life is to achieve these
[17:45] financial goals or is to achieve this
[17:49] lifestyle then everyone is going to be
[17:51] able to achieve their lifestyle at their
[17:52] Pace they can there's no instant
[17:55] gratification is you do you're doing
[17:58] what you can you're sticking to your
[18:00] promises and you're committing to
[18:03] yourself so I think it's habits it's
[18:07] mindset and it's gratification that is
[18:11] not instant but it's the real one um
[18:15] it's going to connect you with yourself
[18:17] more and it's so it's it's I call it
[18:22] like to me this era is money's
[18:26] energy so to me uh money energy and
[18:29] wherever you put your your money on
[18:32] that's where it goes that's what you
[18:34] receive and that's where it goes and if
[18:36] you receive it and then think that
[18:39] whatever you did was bad you're going to
[18:40] feel
[18:41] bad
[18:45] so this is very philosophical but
[18:47] answering your question I believe that
[18:51] it's GNA come down to the point that
[18:53] probably we realize that
[18:56] spending is not what we really want in
[19:00] life spending money maybe we see that we
[19:04] can leave very simple and we can have a
[19:08] very basic life um instead of being
[19:12] wanting like super luery or maybe we can
[19:15] achieve the luxury when we want it and
[19:18] we but it's not like we we need it it's
[19:22] not we need it it's like we want it and
[19:25] we can because we're already work on it
[19:27] and we and if we have it is because we
[19:31] like high
[19:32] value uh quality material stuff but you
[19:36] work on it
[19:38] um and yeah so that's how I see it's
[19:41] like a world where there's more
[19:43] Simplicity and more homelessness it
[19:46] doesn't matter the numbers on your bank
[19:49] account because it's what matters is
[19:52] your habits and your
[19:54] mindset um and and uh yeah definitely
[19:59] and uh I think your story is also really
[20:01] uh inspiring because uh you started in
[20:04] Venezuela now you're in Miami building
[20:06] your own company uh let's let's maybe
[20:09] let's get some context in there for the
[20:11] the viewers that don't know you um how
[20:14] did you start out in in in Venezuela why
[20:17] did you end it up in Miami how did you
[20:19] even come to bitcoin how did you come to
[20:21] to this Finance world and yeah take us a
[20:24] little bit through your
[20:26] story okay um I was born in Venezuela
[20:30] and raised until High School I was
[20:32] educated there until uh I moved to Miami
[20:36] to start my bachelor's degree in
[20:39] University but in that Journey um my
[20:43] parents like five years before they no
[20:47] like seven years before I came here they
[20:49] put me to studying English and I had a
[20:51] second school and I was like why do I
[20:53] need to go to a second school and none
[20:55] of my friends are doing this after the
[20:58] first school and my parents were always
[21:02] like it's very important to know to
[21:05] learn English because English is going
[21:07] to open a lot of doors for you and I was
[21:10] like I fine I couldn't understand that
[21:12] at that point um both my parents were
[21:16] entrepreneurs they worked together for
[21:18] 25 years uh they do Import and Export
[21:21] type of uh companies in
[21:23] Venezuela and and very successful in a
[21:27] way that we could travel to United
[21:29] States every year but uh the last four
[21:32] years of me in Venezuela I'm talking uh
[21:36] 2014 to
[21:38] 2017 um they were
[21:42] very uh they literally changed their
[21:46] mindset like this from White like I I
[21:48] remember like they were like saving more
[21:52] stop spending uh we're probably not
[21:54] going to travel that much for now
[21:56] because my dad says my goal in four
[21:59] years is to get get you out of the
[22:01] country you're not gonna be here anymore
[22:04] I'm like okay I understand that we were
[22:06] living under under a very hard
[22:10] economical and political situation we
[22:13] look at the news every day I wouldn't
[22:16] have electricity at least uh every other
[22:19] day in the week I come from school from
[22:23] my second school at night to do all the
[22:25] homework that I need to do and there's
[22:27] no electricity and literally I have to
[22:29] turn on a candle in my uh desk and work
[22:34] like that and next day have an examine
[22:36] that's how I would do things in a super
[22:39] rich country and it's like wow it was
[22:43] incredible how we we just have to be
[22:46] resilient and patient with whatever we
[22:48] were leing there was no other
[22:51] way we couldn't solve that it's not
[22:54] under own
[22:55] control and and then and next day for
[23:01] example pain points next day uh probably
[23:04] there's no gas and my dad cannot take us
[23:07] to school because he's like he has very
[23:09] few guys and he's like either I us need
[23:11] to take you guys to school to go for
[23:13] work and today I have like five clients
[23:15] visiting the office I cannot skip that I
[23:19] need to find a way to get you to school
[23:22] there's no Ubers there's no this Tais uh
[23:26] type of system and it's very dangerous
[23:29] also um so of course you know you figure
[23:32] it out like calling friends moms hey hey
[23:36] are you can you pick up my girls like
[23:39] challenges that we're like why like
[23:41] these are challenges that just this
[23:43] country leaves really no one else is
[23:46] facing
[23:47] this okay and
[23:50] then all this time pass and you know I
[23:54] was the time that I was getting
[23:55] graduating was protein um I remember my
[24:00] last time in Venezuela was a trip that I
[24:03] did with my friends uh that I we all gr
[24:06] graduated and we took with oursel like
[24:09] packs of these of uh bolivares like
[24:13] packs of bills and we were like we're
[24:16] rich with pack of bills and it's nothing
[24:21] like in one week one of us got out of
[24:24] cash because just in food and pain
[24:27] transportation
[24:28] and we were like uh having fun at the
[24:32] beach we did Tri to the beach out of
[24:35] cash and we call parents like oh my gosh
[24:39] we got a pack of cash and we are giving
[24:43] a pack of cash every time we pay for one
[24:46] foot and it's we were not dollarized at
[24:50] that
[24:51] moment of course that made me realize
[24:53] myself that I really want to leave the
[24:55] country so when my when the I came I was
[24:59] super happy I came to United States to
[25:01] Miami I graduated from business
[25:03] analytics entrepreneurship I completed
[25:06] five different programs for
[25:08] entrepreneurship uh which helped me
[25:11] build uh companies from idea to MVP to
[25:14] MVP to product launch then hypothesis
[25:18] testing and then if you got a good good
[25:21] company just go and growth and scale so
[25:24] I did that five times this is my set
[25:27] time uh this I'm doing right now I think
[25:31] it's my best one um I ever felt before
[25:36] and um I'm I'm not going to stop in
[25:39] terms of I really came to this country
[25:42] to be an entrepreneur and even though I
[25:44] work for companies I always tell them
[25:47] listen I'm entrepreneurial at heart and
[25:50] if you want to I I want to be add value
[25:54] to in in the bigger projects the one
[25:57] that CA is the biggest impact like I
[26:00] always want to have huge impact so
[26:02] that's how I decided to work in the
[26:03] Bitcoin industry uh I met the CEO of
[26:08] iets in Miami and he saw me working on a
[26:14] co-working space for my previous company
[26:16] on digital marketing agency and he's
[26:19] like whoow you plan all this event and
[26:22] like yes and um this my own company is
[26:24] like we we want someone like you and the
[26:27] team to to you know launch this product
[26:30] in Miami and it was the payment
[26:33] processor for Bitcoin payments and I was
[26:35] like oh my gosh this sounds like the
[26:37] most ovative thing I ever heard about it
[26:40] with Bitcoin I was so I came like from
[26:44] Venezuela I came here and I only like
[26:47] would hear about Bitcoin as an
[26:49] investment at home my mom would invest
[26:51] in Bitcoin a lot and that's how I learn
[26:53] about Bitcoin um as an investment never
[26:56] heard of that Bitcoin payment processor
[26:59] already assisted so it was very
[27:02] Innovative um I was always uh very
[27:04] grateful about my job with ibet um
[27:08] because they helped me see the potential
[27:10] for Bitcoin technology and um problems
[27:13] that can solve for different Industries
[27:17] so basically I came in and started
[27:19] solving problems for the merchants on
[27:22] their
[27:23] transactions uh to get lower transaction
[27:26] fees to stop getting charged bags to um
[27:31] um get faster payments uh under their
[27:35] wallet if they want to add Bitcoin to
[27:37] their treasury so all these problems I
[27:40] was like helping them solve and I love
[27:42] Bitcoin about because of that uh and
[27:45] then I
[27:46] continue my evolution in the Bitcoin
[27:49] industry by uh exploring different
[27:51] sectors of the economy so I went to the
[27:54] food supply chain and I talked to a lot
[27:57] of farmers and onard for a lot of
[27:58] farmers and educate them about
[28:01] Bitcoin um I will help them set up their
[28:04] e-commerce store to sell beef on bitcoin
[28:09] um and I lived in Texas on a ranch as
[28:13] well to learn more about their business
[28:15] model and what other ways uh Bitcoin
[28:18] could help them and I came back to
[28:22] Miami and then after that I Chang from
[28:25] Bitcoin payments to bitcoin earnings so
[28:28] I started uh working with a company that
[28:32] was building tools to help people
[28:34] earning Bitcoin from South America
[28:36] earning for what you said okay earning
[28:39] they're digital products basically how
[28:42] to today's economy is like everyone is
[28:45] like a digital Creator but there's
[28:47] people that wants to take this seriously
[28:50] and really make Revenue like podcasters
[28:53] like you um or maybe artist did you
[28:58] artist and probably you want to get paid
[29:01] from someone from you know another
[29:03] country uh how can you do that in a
[29:06] platform that allows you to communicate
[29:08] and um receive payments so I used to
[29:12] work with a SP chat uh which allowed me
[29:15] the opportunity to um understand this
[29:18] market and work with C creators from the
[29:22] different parts of the world me
[29:24] onboarding them to Ling Network
[29:27] onboarding them to bitcoin it was super
[29:29] fascinating and um I I learned that that
[29:36] that they these people actually are very
[29:38] conscious about um they're suffering
[29:41] monetization issues because the current
[29:44] platforms that it says to monetize your
[29:47] efforts and earn residual income are not
[29:51] super
[29:53] um okay one of them like few of them
[29:56] like YouTube for example Patron they
[29:58] charge like 30% of their income so it's
[30:02] very hard for them to monetize and gr
[30:04] grow with this or some of them pay them
[30:07] like after five days um when the
[30:10] payments process like in terms of
[30:12] payments and
[30:13] monetization this is where Bitcoin has
[30:16] opportunity um and it's like whoa it's
[30:19] crazy but now now
[30:22] um okay where am I okay yes now this is
[30:26] my journey I still working in Bitcoin
[30:28] I'm just expanding to crossboard
[30:32] payments and for to help um send
[30:35] payments from United States to Mexico or
[30:39] to uh Honduras Guatemala um Argentina so
[30:44] crossboard payments not necessarily with
[30:47] Bitcoin we're starting with uh Global
[30:51] remittances um and the use of uh
[30:56] probably a stable coins
[30:58] um but of course Bitcoin is is is is
[31:02] like the next step um and when I say I'm
[31:05] starting this is because I'm starting to
[31:08] add value to tools that already exist
[31:12] that already have traction to growth
[31:15] even faster or reach more more or you
[31:19] know growth their company metrics either
[31:22] in Partnerships uh Revenue user
[31:25] engagement but also my best is community
[31:29] engagement and um boarding process in
[31:33] terms of product so creating that in F
[31:37] Tech is
[31:38] necessarily more when you're exchanging
[31:41] money from one country to the other you
[31:44] want to have people to feel a sense of
[31:47] community with your platform so yeah um
[31:52] um I'm loving this journey of uh working
[31:54] ftech and of course um
[31:58] maximizing my Bitcoin Investments as um
[32:02] as the right tool as the right path for
[32:05] uh right now Millennials for creators
[32:09] for merchants so all these personas they
[32:12] can come to me and I'm going to be open
[32:15] to understand their pain points and
[32:17] their problems as I already have
[32:19] investigated um and got have deep
[32:23] analysis on the markets um so yeah um
[32:28] they I always say you can always chat
[32:29] with me reach out I have a mom that is a
[32:33] fan of Bitcoin and if I don't know
[32:36] something about Bitcoin probably I come
[32:38] home and probably learned something new
[32:41] um I've been learning more about Bitcoin
[32:43] mining
[32:45] um uh but it's it's a long process it's
[32:48] been three years you know and I'm still
[32:51] learning um still learning all the
[32:53] technology still learning all these
[32:55] questions there's so many questions is I
[32:57] an entire monetary system um to
[33:01] understand um so yeah I would say to
[33:05] friends let's just talk about Bitcoin
[33:07] and see what new questions come up uh
[33:10] that we probably didn't thought about it
[33:13] yeah and it's fascinating because I'm
[33:15] for year in the space and I'm doing now
[33:17] daily podcast and I have so many guests
[33:20] on and every guest is bringing something
[33:23] new to the table and I did not had any
[33:26] podcast where like I did not learn
[33:28] anything today like every time there's
[33:30] some new perspective on something
[33:32] something that I can learn from and it's
[33:34] it's an amazing journey and it humbles
[33:36] me every time I have a guest on because
[33:38] there's something new coming up I also
[33:40] like the Blu-ray example because I often
[33:43] see Blu-ray like as uh not Blu-ray
[33:46] stable coins example I like because I
[33:48] see stable Co like as Blu-ray Blu-ray
[33:52] was this great uh invention from CDs to
[33:54] Blu-ray uh which makes stuff better but
[33:57] then all of the sudden the internet came
[33:59] and this is kind of how I see it in
[34:01] stable coins they have now use cases uh
[34:04] but in the long run Bitcoin will yeah
[34:08] eliminate all those use cases because
[34:10] it's just like putting feat on better
[34:12] digital rails uh but Bitcoin is solving
[34:15] the underlying monetary problem as well
[34:17] so I I I like stable coins in the medium
[34:20] term but long term it will be only
[34:23] Bitcoin so that's why I'm I'm really
[34:24] focused on on on bitcoin but I I see
[34:26] that there are
[34:28] right now uh in the short term or medium
[34:31] term maybe even use cases for for stable
[34:34] coins I'm not and and that's still good
[34:37] news right because that means still
[34:40] people are this is how people are trying
[34:42] to solve their problems right now like
[34:45] they are out of the Fiat system and
[34:48] they're trying to they're trying stable
[34:51] coins as like their next step and some
[34:54] of us have already understand the big
[34:57] potential Bitcoin but maybe they're not
[34:59] there yet and that's okay the most
[35:02] important part is like the ones that are
[35:04] on the side of uh already on bitcoin how
[35:09] can we better leverage and like bring
[35:13] productivity to these users um in what
[35:17] ways with Bitcoin how can we better
[35:20] educate how can we better engage uh and
[35:24] add value test Etc um
[35:28] and and without creating fear or
[35:31] assumptions um but really like uh work
[35:36] in hands with those tools those
[35:38] companies those use cases yeah I I think
[35:42] I that's to me like more of the approach
[35:45] um that I would consider that's the one
[35:48] that I'm taking is like I'm coming from
[35:50] a place of understanding and how can I
[35:53] help um with Bitcoin on these
[35:58] Technologies to transition to a bigger a
[36:03] better solution so yeah amazing and you
[36:07] also said in the in in the before talk
[36:10] and I think I saw it on on Twitter also
[36:12] that your mom orange peed you this is
[36:15] something I never heard before that a
[36:17] mom orange peed someone no crazy I know
[36:22] I know and yeah so crazy you have to
[36:26] it's funny she literally texted me like
[36:30] any time of the day she probably sent me
[36:32] a video she's like you should check this
[36:34] out she invest in Bitcoin I invest in
[36:37] Bitcoin today she do she's always like
[36:39] keeping in track of things um yeah both
[36:42] my parents they love that I work in the
[36:44] Bitcoin industry uh yeah it's uh my dad
[36:49] is very analytical and like she he asked
[36:52] me a lot of questions um about Bitcoin
[36:55] which is good he makes me think a lot uh
[36:58] he's also learning and um and and yes
[37:02] funny yeah she is the one that orange
[37:05] peill me she orange peill my sister my
[37:07] sh my sister bought her first Bitcoin
[37:09] this year like I've been doing that from
[37:13] before but she was like I don't know I
[37:15] don't know I don't know every time they
[37:17] they we're together at home we're always
[37:20] talking about bcoin my mom and I my
[37:22] sister okay fine I'll go to invest 21
[37:25] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only for from day one
[37:28] and they teach and preach self custody
[37:31] this is my goto exchange when someone
[37:34] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[37:36] from this is the easiest entry for
[37:39] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[37:42] Plus at the same time support this
[37:44] podcast use code Robin and click the
[37:47] link in the description amazing and um
[37:49] I'm Al also asking myself the question a
[37:52] lot how do we get uh the people the
[37:55] world to adopt Bitcoin how do we get the
[37:58] whole world on a Bitcoin standard and
[38:01] that's why I'm also really interested in
[38:02] the orange billing stories because these
[38:05] are the stories where someone goes from
[38:08] I am in the feeld system I'm saving in
[38:11] dollars but oh there is an alternative
[38:13] there's Bitcoin and now I'm checking
[38:15] this out I said myself for three years
[38:18] straight that Bitcoin is a scam and then
[38:21] uh more and more friends challenged me
[38:24] uh because I made a lot of money in the
[38:26] stock market so was uh this the stock
[38:28] guy and people are like Hey how do you
[38:31] do that what do you think of Bitcoin and
[38:34] at one weekend I wanted to prove a
[38:36] friend wrong he was like hey what do you
[38:38] think of Bitcoin I don't like I like
[38:40] Bitcoin what do you think of it and I
[38:42] was like yeah it's a scam and I just
[38:44] discovered that um I ran out of
[38:47] arguments and on Friday I decided okay
[38:50] let's dive into Bitcoin uh on Sunday I
[38:54] was like H Maybe I'm Wrong Monday I
[38:57] bought Bitcoin dday I bought my first
[38:59] Ledger uh and one year later I was all
[39:02] in Bitcoin like there was only Bitcoin
[39:04] for me uh in one year later so like this
[39:07] orange stories once once you get Bitcoin
[39:09] once you get sound money uh so much
[39:12] changes in your life I mean for me it's
[39:14] it's maybe not that transformative
[39:16] because I saw it so early like I was
[39:19] 2021 uh when I got Bitcoin uh so it's
[39:23] different for people that are maybe like
[39:25] 30 maybe they're like 50 even maybe
[39:27] there are like I have can you imagine
[39:30] like I have 133% of my viewers on
[39:33] YouTube are above 65 years old so I'm
[39:36] I'm really blessed and and and thankful
[39:38] for them that people that are on this
[39:41] age level are choosing to watch some
[39:44] some 25 yearold that has no clue about
[39:47] the world and just trying to figure out
[39:49] what Bitcoin is with amazing guest um
[39:53] watch me so I'm I'm really grateful for
[39:55] that and uh I'm I'm astonished how when
[39:59] older people then orange building their
[40:02] kids and we're getting now to the stage
[40:04] where the older people saying hey let's
[40:06] let's let's get our kids on on on on
[40:09] this on this thing and um you have a lot
[40:12] of orange ping stories I saw on Twitter
[40:14] you have a lot of orange bling stories
[40:15] you have orange bling story also with
[40:17] your mom that you were orange built by
[40:19] her um so I would just give you the
[40:22] question and you can do whatever you
[40:23] want with that how do we get the world
[40:26] uh to adopt Bitcoin how we how do we
[40:29] succeed with that my biggest Insight
[40:32] that it all
[40:34] comes understanding what is the money
[40:37] what is
[40:39] money ask everyone what is money for you
[40:44] what does money means to
[40:46] you and start there that's my point
[40:51] start the
[40:52] conversation what is
[40:54] money what is money to you like from the
[40:58] very beginnner
[41:00] mindset and to me that's how you bring
[41:05] awareness to the world to
[41:07] think about money and they're going to
[41:11] realize that the way that we have been
[41:13] told what money is and how it works and
[41:16] how it should work and d and this is
[41:18] what you do with it and you need to say
[41:20] for this you need to pay this and you
[41:22] need that's it's just ideas of others um
[41:27] um that the world is much
[41:30] more
[41:31] um abundant than and than limited as the
[41:36] Fiat system could
[41:37] be because what it is is that okay Fiat
[41:43] system is it helps you but then it
[41:46] trapped
[41:48] you it's like student loan depths he
[41:51] helps you but then after you probably
[41:54] ask for 48,000 student like done but
[41:58] with 22% so in 15 years you're going to
[42:01] end up paying
[42:05] $156,000 so from 48 to 150 seats what
[42:08] does that means what really that means
[42:11] so it's like I think the question is
[42:14] what is money an open conversation St
[42:17] start talking about money with people
[42:19] with friends with everyone around you
[42:22] don't start there start with money on
[42:27] understand money with your friends and
[42:29] where they're at and get it from there
[42:32] it's it's incredible I just been doing
[42:34] that
[42:35] and that's what I realized I needed to
[42:38] build a company that helps people to
[42:40] become aware of money and their personal
[42:44] money habits because they're going to
[42:46] start making decisions once they start
[42:48] being aware but for what okay you're
[42:51] going to invest on what okay on the best
[42:54] money now
[42:57] and so it's
[42:58] like um that's how I'm doing it in a way
[43:02] personally now uh but of course
[43:07] um every industry every person have
[43:10] different problems and we need to think
[43:15] better for very specific Niche Target
[43:19] groups like how can we help like uh like
[43:25] like when when I went to the ranchers
[43:26] how can we help 1% of United States
[43:31] regenerative Farmers around the country
[43:35] to learn about Bitcoin just 1% of the
[43:38] entire agriculture
[43:40] sector and let's go visit them and let's
[43:44] do what we can and they have
[43:46] conversation and see what their pain
[43:48] points are and I think that's
[43:53] powerful and that's what to me adoption
[43:57] looks like is doing the work yeah is
[44:01] doing the real is the work like that so
[44:04] um yeah you have to go to all all the
[44:09] person like if I had an uh gave
[44:12] presentation I think a year ago uh in
[44:14] front of like young people between 20
[44:16] and 25 and it was basically a Bitcoin
[44:20] talk and I did not wanted to talk about
[44:23] Bitcoin because then the whole topic
[44:27] would be shifted to like oh Bitcoin is
[44:29] bad from the environment Bitcoin is that
[44:32] and that this this whole F would have
[44:34] came up and I wanted to avoid that from
[44:36] the
[44:37] beginning so what I did was asking them
[44:42] and we spent in whole hour on that part
[44:44] only ask them what do you want uh in
[44:48] money if you have the power if you God
[44:52] how would you um make money good like
[44:56] what properties are you searching from
[44:59] and the whole property list like we know
[45:02] from the money properties that uh people
[45:05] that study Bitcoin and a economics know
[45:08] it came up it's just like it came up in
[45:10] different words it came up with
[45:11] different uh facets and we spent an
[45:14] whole hour on that and we discussed like
[45:17] oh is this good can we group that
[45:19] together we voted on stuff and the
[45:21] outcome of the first hour was like oh
[45:24] yes this are the properties of money
[45:26] that we searching for
[45:27] and then we put all the asset classes on
[45:30] top of it like Fiat Bitcoin gold
[45:34] everything we we listed uh and then we
[45:37] voted again like is gold a good store of
[45:41] value is would that be a good uh um unit
[45:44] of account would that like we all the
[45:46] properties we
[45:47] listed uh then we voted on all each uh
[45:51] on each property on each asset and the
[45:55] end of the day it was oh Bitcoin is
[45:58] actually the perfect money if we look at
[46:00] it first principles uh and I think this
[46:03] is the way better approach to um ask the
[46:06] question like uh not like when we
[46:08] someone asks me oh why Bitcoin and I'm
[46:11] like what is money it's like the the the
[46:15] the question should be otherwise like we
[46:17] should encourage people to think in
[46:19] first principles and and do that and not
[46:21] like find painkillers a lot a lot of the
[46:24] feat world is like let's find pain pain
[46:27] killers for the pain that feat is is is
[46:29] rooting in us uh let's fix the
[46:32] underlying problem and then we can go
[46:34] forward uh one part of your story I want
[46:37] to uh dig in before we we end the
[46:40] podcast with the end routine um you
[46:43] lived on the farm I think for two months
[46:45] or something like that you said and this
[46:47] is something amazing because this also
[46:49] tells us a lot of about your personality
[46:51] you just live there for two months you
[46:54] let yourself really dig into this whole
[46:56] thing
[46:57] like actually like a lot of people are
[46:59] like virtu culating they're going under
[47:01] the farm interviewing the farmer for
[47:03] like an afternoon and they're like now I
[47:05] know what the farmer's pain points are
[47:07] but you actually lived there like two
[47:09] months uh and I grew up on a farm
[47:12] actually kind of not really uh but it's
[47:14] really close to me so I was every day
[47:16] there um what did you learn on the farm
[47:20] uh besides uh how they can integrate
[47:24] Bitcoin and stuff like that what what
[47:25] what how was it different than the life
[47:28] in Miami I don't know how different it
[47:30] was to the life in in Venezuela what did
[47:33] you learn on the
[47:35] farm well um okay I learned
[47:41] from um mowing the soil planting the
[47:45] seed like planting the seeds moil the
[47:48] soil uh getting rid of uh the this uh
[47:53] plants that are called uh the weeds I
[47:57] think plant weeds the yeah the weeds
[48:00] getting rid of the weeds um moving cows
[48:05] about 8 80 acres by 80 acres sorting
[48:10] them picking them like giving them food
[48:13] which is not really they eat from grass
[48:16] because I lived on a farm that is pure
[48:19] regenerative um so they eat all in grass
[48:22] and then sorting them taking the cattle
[48:25] to the processing plant sorting them on
[48:27] a on horse so horse riding um taking
[48:31] them to the processing plants going to
[48:34] processing plants signing the
[48:36] paper giving them the cows seeing
[48:40] other huge trucks doing the same taking
[48:43] the cows from the truck then after that
[48:46] packaging the meat unpackaging the meat
[48:50] cooking the meat eating the meat selling
[48:52] the meat delivering the meat working
[48:54] farmers markets um um literally I did
[48:58] everything
[48:59] and that's one part on the other side
[49:03] every time um every day the farmer will
[49:08] start with a story about the difference
[49:12] between regener farming and traditional
[49:15] and conventional farming United States
[49:18] and why they why there's two size of it
[49:22] why 99% of the meat in the United States
[49:26] have
[49:27] um or cows that inject antibiotics or
[49:31] eat hay the hay that is artificial um
[49:36] basically we he's like do you want to
[49:38] know what this means okay let's go to
[49:39] the land I'll show you so we see I'll
[49:43] come we come to the land and in the car
[49:47] as we go in the car we see two lands of
[49:51] hay and he's like pay attention to this
[49:54] one and now we're going to pay attention
[49:56] to the other one the first one was a
[49:58] color like a yellow color the second one
[50:02] was green color lower grass and he's
[50:05] like can you see the difference I see I
[50:07] see the difference in color and size
[50:09] he's like exactly the yellow one is the
[50:12] one that is uh has P pesticides and
[50:15] chemicals so it can grow
[50:17] faster and the green one slower is the
[50:20] one that is
[50:21] natural he's like I buy the hay for my
[50:24] cows from the natural that means that
[50:27] regenerative
[50:29] farming really like give hate to their
[50:33] cows even hay that is organic and like
[50:37] natural we don't even do the hay that is
[50:39] given to the tra that is the the pasture
[50:43] that is given to the
[50:45] traditional so it was incredible to see
[50:48] how food how food is made from the
[50:52] beginning it all Matters from the soil
[50:56] and from the ground like from the root
[50:59] is where everything basically go after
[51:03] after and after um so seeing that seeing
[51:06] the difference of of cows cows one that
[51:09] is regenerative one is that is
[51:11] conventional um one is more bloated than
[51:14] the other one actually fat he said can
[51:18] you see the the bones behind the cows
[51:21] they have like two bones in the he's
[51:24] like if you don't see the bones in the
[51:26] cow is because they are um conventional
[51:32] fitted and they probably ate grains so
[51:36] they have more gr more um uh grassa how
[51:40] do you say grassa um greased
[51:44] no
[51:46] Tallow no how do you say
[51:49] grassa
[51:52] um
[51:53] fat they have more they have more fat
[51:57] in that part that they should have um
[52:01] and that's not okay so I did that and
[52:05] then in a processing plan inside I got a
[52:07] tour one day and I could see a cow like
[52:10] open and everything and it's like whoa
[52:12] this is
[52:13] real um yeah there's so much oh
[52:16] traditions and culture also I was living
[52:19] in Texas La of Texas um I learned about
[52:23] a lot about their politics uh and
[52:25] politics in the industry politics in
[52:28] this country in the state
[52:31] um and yeah like literally it's like a
[52:34] different country over there than Miami
[52:37] it's different such a
[52:39] different lifestyle and if I do Texas
[52:43] again I will leave in that ranch I
[52:46] wouldn't that's how you that's how you
[52:48] do it that's what that's what you leave
[52:50] there like honestly there's no other way
[52:53] um and yeah it was I learned shooting
[52:57] um that was fun too fun and and like
[53:01] impressive that you know um I don't know
[53:04] it was impressive to me to be honest um
[53:07] that everyone would have a gone there
[53:09] like H it's like s it's like normal to
[53:13] do uh but they have their reasons and I
[53:17] I
[53:18] respect and um yeah so that was pretty
[53:24] much my experience besides the
[53:27] like helping them set up Bitcoin
[53:29] payments and all of these part and and
[53:33] yeah and like at the end of the day they
[53:36] were accepting Bitcoin payments for
[53:37] their for their meet and that was
[53:40] amazing to see that I was there with
[53:42] them and people were buying their
[53:44] website in Bitcoin amazing I love it and
[53:48] there's so much in there and then we
[53:50] already like close to the one one hour
[53:52] mark uh I mean we I I have so many more
[53:56] questions to you but I think we will cut
[53:59] it here and make a second dra we a part
[54:01] two yeah we will make a we'll make a
[54:03] part two especially also when you're
[54:05] just now launching Filipa maybe we can
[54:07] do like in a year or half a year uh when
[54:10] when it's up and running and help
[54:12] already people with with success stories
[54:14] and stuff like that uh I'm really
[54:16] looking forward to that um just before
[54:19] we end the before we go to the end
[54:21] routine uh what do you expect in your
[54:23] life the next like half a month what's
[54:26] uh half a month half a year or six
[54:28] months uh what's the up and cominging
[54:30] thing probably Philipa and uh building
[54:33] that out right yeah basically raising
[54:37] money for felipa hiring software
[54:40] development team um we are
[54:43] executing uh customer acquisition uh
[54:47] strategies to get traction to the
[54:50] platform right now we already have a
[54:53] Join Beta list weight list uh for
[54:57] potential users that want to be part of
[54:59] we're starting a community chat in
[55:01] Discord as well that talks about money
[55:04] uh probably we're going to have some
[55:05] talks around Bitcoin um in which I'll
[55:08] send to you the QR codes or the links
[55:11] for you also to join and to share and so
[55:14] that's on one side felipa and I'm um
[55:17] taking the route of yeah uh becoming
[55:20] this big
[55:21] Financial
[55:23] um it's no educational platform
[55:27] but it's it's literacy right and it's
[55:31] going to start from Personal Finance
[55:33] Management but probably of course we're
[55:36] going to have Bitcoin um some creative
[55:38] Bitcoin ideas and solutions that I'm
[55:42] sure they're going to come up
[55:44] and and then on the other side I'm
[55:47] contributing to the Bitcoin
[55:49] industry um as contractor in providing
[55:52] consulting services on um strategy
[55:55] Market marketing Outreach and community

[57:00] fintech um out there like Gathering
[57:04] feedback and and providing Solutions or
[57:08] understanding problems if that makes
[57:09] sense so I'm taking that route for
[57:12] networking um and yeah and and of course
[57:18] who knows it's not on my plans like to
[57:21] fully commit to a
[57:23] full-time uh employe role right now now
