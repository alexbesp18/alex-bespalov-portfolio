[00:00] Oh, like with you having really strong
[00:02] opinions about Bitcoin mining and how
[00:04] wasteful it is, I thought you knew
[00:06] something about how energy markets
[00:08] function. What I really want to see is
[00:09] Bitcoiners realize like, oh, it's not us
[00:12] needing the Republican party, it's the
[00:14] Republican party needing us is way more
[00:16] important because there's a whole
[00:18] contingency of people that go, "Wait a
[00:19] minute." So, like, you can't actually
[00:20] stop this Bitcoin thing. Like, even if
[00:22] the government owns it, they can't like
[00:24] seize other people's Bitcoin. Like, tell
[00:26] me more. It's a hierarchical thing. So
[00:27] it means like they have to see and
[00:29] understand that Bitcoin is more
[00:30] important and a better storage of value
[00:32] than real estate or bonds or any other
[00:35] thing. So in that it means like they
[00:37] have to dump the real estate. They have
[00:38] to dump the bond. And I think that's why
[00:40] it's so powerful is that like this
[00:42] really is just a path of critical
[00:44] thinking. And I think anybody who does
[00:46] seriously take on Bitcoin as a project
[00:49] for critical thinking almost universally
[00:52] those people become Bitcoiners because
[00:54] well that's just what the truth is.
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] trying to be like I'm proud to be
[01:02] Austrian immediately gets you to like oh
[01:05] so you're like one of those people and
[01:07] you're like somebody who likes my
[01:09] culture and they're like no you know
[01:11] what I mean and it's like
[01:14] yeah that's it's it's a funny thing. uh
[01:17] you you you're almost ashamed to be
[01:19] proud to be an Austrian because of the
[01:21] past uh where you didn't even exist at
[01:25] that point.
[01:27] Yeah. Well, and like that is being
[01:29] inherently taken advantage of of that
[01:31] like you know Austrian national identity
[01:34] is falling apart at the seam. So you
[01:36] guys have welcomed uh through an open
[01:38] border policy essentially allowing
[01:40] people to come in destroy that national
[01:42] identity and furthermore from the
[01:44] indoctrination from the far left like
[01:46] you should be ashamed and you should
[01:48] hate yourself and you should put
[01:50] yourself beneath other immigrants and
[01:51] you should sacrifice Austrian culture to
[01:53] do that. And I think there's a
[01:56] particular reactionaryism right now
[01:57] that's like I'm not sure if all these
[01:59] things are necessarily true. And even
[02:01] trying to put that forward, it's like,
[02:03] oh, so like you're a hateful right-wing
[02:05] Nazi. And it's like, no, I'm just trying
[02:08] to ask a question. And like we have
[02:11] something very problematic here in the
[02:12] same way in America. Like, you know, I'm
[02:14] in San Francisco right now of like in
[02:17] the the real core of the leftist bubble.
[02:20] Uh, and like doing anything like being
[02:22] like, "Hey, like I actually think like
[02:24] Elon Musk exposing corruption in the
[02:27] federal government like is a good thing.
[02:29] I don't necessarily agree with all of
[02:30] Trump's policies or feel that going full
[02:34] tariffs is the best way, but there could
[02:36] be something there." Like that
[02:37] immediately gets to like, oh, like
[02:39] you're a right-wing Nazi who like hates
[02:41] anybody that like isn't white. And it's
[02:43] like, no, that that wasn't actually what
[02:45] I said. Maybe we can directly take that
[02:48] um as a starting point for the podcast
[02:51] uh with with a with a Bitcoin swing on
[02:53] it. Uh because I I wonder a lot how
[02:58] Bitcoin will actually change or impact
[03:01] our lives politically and how we
[03:03] organize ourselves maybe in a little bit
[03:06] more of a sovereign way when we have
[03:08] cryptography at the heart of of of what
[03:10] we're doing. How do you look at that?
[03:12] Yeah, like I think we're actually on the
[03:14] precipice of a very new political
[03:17] identity that's like no longer about
[03:18] this right left stuff from the 20th
[03:20] century that frankly like isn't serving
[03:22] anymore. Uh it's sort of a higher level
[03:24] identity of like look like my interest
[03:26] is whether or not uh like you want to be
[03:29] able to have a money that has a fixed
[03:31] supply that's inherently deflationary
[03:33] and is going to respect my rights and
[03:36] access to the network in the same way
[03:37] it'll respect your rights and access to
[03:40] the network. And I think that that uh as
[03:43] people really understand more and more
[03:44] what that means, particularly as we
[03:47] because like it's very clear that we're
[03:48] at the end of the Brettonwood system
[03:50] right now and it's very unclear of
[03:52] what's going to come after it. Uh and
[03:55] like in Austria, the fact that like you
[03:56] guys are on the euro and that you
[03:58] inherently don't have any kind of
[04:01] monetary control over, you know, the
[04:03] sort of money that you guys use, like
[04:05] that's extremely problematic. And so I
[04:08] think anybody that wants any degree of
[04:10] self- sovereignty, however they identify
[04:12] nationally or otherwise, like this is
[04:14] the thing that actually really protects
[04:16] them. And I think it becomes the rhym of
[04:18] a political movement because people go,
[04:19] "Oh, like if you're interested in free
[04:21] and self-s sovereign money, like you
[04:22] probably actually have uh like strong uh
[04:26] like classic liberal individualist ideas
[04:28] about that like you're entitled to own
[04:30] your own money. Like you should have a a
[04:32] right to freedom of speech. You should
[04:33] choose what to be able to do with your
[04:35] body."
[04:36] Um, and so I think like Bitcoin really
[04:39] is a shelling point for people of all
[04:42] different political identities to
[04:44] essentially come to this sort of uh like
[04:47] radical moder. And like that radicalism
[04:49] is like I shouldn't have control or
[04:52] power over your wealth and you shouldn't
[04:54] have that over me. And like that should
[04:55] be like a pretty basic agreement point
[04:58] that we can move forward from.
[05:01] And it and and when you listen to that,
[05:03] it's so interesting uh because countries
[05:05] like Austria have a way and and El
[05:08] Salvador showed that having way bigger
[05:10] incentive to actually adopt Bitcoin. So
[05:13] it's so interesting for me that the USA
[05:16] is now having a strategic Bitcoin
[05:18] reserve before smaller countries. I mean
[05:21] El Salvador had it before, Bhutan has
[05:23] it. like there small examples, but I
[05:26] thought personally before that all
[05:27] happened that the USA will be one of the
[05:30] last countries that that actually does
[05:32] anything in that regard, especially
[05:34] publicly. I thought like, oh, like maybe
[05:36] um behind the scenes they already have
[05:38] like, oh, like we have those 200,000
[05:39] Bitcoin, we already declare that we will
[05:41] never sell them and stuff like that and
[05:43] maybe we buy some without people
[05:45] noticing. But it really surprised me
[05:48] that they came out now so early for me
[05:50] that hey we have a strategic bitcoin
[05:52] reserve and we might buy. I mean in my
[05:55] opinion it's just part of a double irony
[05:58] of that uh like it cuz you' think the US
[06:02] would be the last to go because of sort
[06:03] of how inherently corrupt our political
[06:05] system is and how uh money interest it
[06:09] is. Uh, but essentially like David
[06:11] Bailey pretty much unilaterally made a
[06:13] decision that he was like, "Look, we're
[06:15] going to like bankroll Trump's
[06:16] campaign. We're going to show him we're
[06:18] very serious and important contributors
[06:21] and we're going to presence him to the
[06:22] fact of why Bitcoin's important." And
[06:24] so, like, he pretty much single-handedly
[06:27] ram that down Trump's throat and had him
[06:29] get it. And because of that, we now have
[06:32] uh this pretty powerful contingency of
[06:34] Bitcoiners within the Republican party.
[06:37] Uh, and I and like I think that's been
[06:38] very useful up until now. What I really
[06:41] want to see is Bitcoiners realize like,
[06:43] oh, uh, it's not us needing the
[06:46] Republican party, it's the Republican
[06:47] party needing us. And that should show
[06:49] how disposable they are to our point in
[06:51] time cuz like it's it's very obvious to
[06:53] me that Bitcoin that that Bitcoiners and
[06:56] the ideology we represent is part of a
[06:59] political zeitgeist of the future and
[07:01] that like we're at the top of the
[07:02] cultural funnel. And so I feel very
[07:05] strongly and and I think there's a lot
[07:07] more possibility in Europe than there is
[07:09] in the United States of that like
[07:11] there's a possibility of creating a
[07:12] radical uh like third party like like
[07:15] orange party like technological forward
[07:18] party that
[07:19] can really make a decision to go into
[07:22] parliament be pretty forceful and
[07:26] uh trying to think of the right word
[07:28] that I want pretty forceful and radical
[07:31] and pretty much being like we represent
[07:32] And like we don't want anybody to have
[07:34] power over the money. We want you to
[07:35] have technological rights. You need to
[07:37] have the power of encryption to protect
[07:39] your privacy and we won't compromise on
[07:41] this. And all the other parties are full
[07:43] of They hate you. They
[07:45] believe that they should own you to some
[07:46] extent. And if you don't listen to them,
[07:48] they want to steal your rights, your
[07:50] money or other things. And we're going
[07:51] to represent something that stands
[07:52] against that. And in parliaments, you
[07:55] know, like if you get two or three seats
[07:56] in parliament, that that's like a
[07:58] meaningful thing. Whereas because we
[08:00] just have the two-party system here in
[08:01] the United States, we don't we can't get
[08:03] anything remotely similar to that. So,
[08:06] uh, and my experience of talking with
[08:07] European Bitcoiners is that like
[08:09] ideologically,
[08:11] uh, specifically like the German and
[08:12] Austrian contingency, like you guys seem
[08:14] to be more ideologically advanced and
[08:16] well organized than really kind of any
[08:18] other contingency.
[08:20] So, in my opinion, like it's really just
[08:22] about a few individuals making a
[08:24] decision that like we're going to create
[08:26] a radical orange party that is going to
[08:29] like go into European parliaments and be
[08:32] totally uncompromising and and really
[08:34] just kind of shout down the competition
[08:36] cuz like whether it's the Liberals or
[08:38] the Conservatives, both hate
[08:40] you. both have technologically
[08:43] uh regressive positions uh and they
[08:47] really seek to have a
[08:50] permissionbased system where like you
[08:52] have to ask the government for
[08:53] permission of what what to do and I
[08:55] think there's a real potential to be
[08:56] like no we're going to use encryption
[08:58] technology in Bitcoin to make sure that
[09:00] we can't debase your currency that we
[09:02] can't steal your money from you when you
[09:04] do something that we don't like and
[09:06] we're going to use these as a basis to
[09:08] start building out a sort of new techn
[09:10] technological political system that is
[09:12] going to ensure everybody gets to have
[09:14] political rights in this new system. You
[09:16] you you said something interesting. You
[09:17] said
[09:19] technology
[09:20] technological. I'm sorry. I cannot It's
[09:23] all right. I swear these words too.
[09:24] Yeah. Like and and then rights like what
[09:27] what do you mean by that? Well, it's
[09:29] kind of funny because like rights don't
[09:31] exist and it doesn't like if I have a
[09:33] gun to your head, there isn't anything
[09:35] you can do. We could we can talk as much
[09:36] as we want about political rights.
[09:38] There's like a great meme of uh there's
[09:41] like a it's like a couple guys bound up
[09:43] and like the government's like shooting
[09:44] each person in the back of the head and
[09:46] like one guy is like hey like this is
[09:49] unconstitutional like these guys are
[09:51] going to like learn a lesson here and
[09:52] like that goes to show like what rights
[09:54] really are. But with encryption
[09:57] technology like if if I choose to
[09:59] actually encrypt the data set that I
[10:01] have like there's nothing you can
[10:03] actually do to get access to that data.
[10:06] And so if we start sharing these
[10:08] methodologies to be able to encrypt
[10:10] information and share information, but
[10:12] furthermore, we get legal protections
[10:14] that say like in the United States like
[10:15] we we have a right to be able to use
[10:17] encryption technology because really
[10:20] because of the first and fourth
[10:21] amendments and what those provide to us,
[10:22] but it's an extra legal shell that
[10:25] essentially says, oh yeah, like this is
[10:27] actually part of your rights to speech.
[10:29] If you could get something similar to
[10:31] that found uh either in, you know, the
[10:33] European constitution or in the
[10:34] individual Austrian one, there might be
[10:36] something pretty powerful there. But
[10:38] it's really at the end of the day that
[10:39] like these quote unquote rights are
[10:42] really about the one-way function that
[10:45] this technology has. So like when when
[10:47] I'm speaking about rights, it's sort of
[10:48] a much larger concept in terms of a
[10:52] technique that can't be undone. And so
[10:54] in in a lot of ways it's kind of like
[10:56] the most primary of all rights because
[10:58] it's no longer about permission seeking
[11:00] but it's about what can't be taken.
[11:03] That's super interesting. I also love
[11:04] the idea that in Europe because I've
[11:06] seen it over the past 5 10 15 years in
[11:10] Austria there are so many small
[11:12] countries are so many small parties that
[11:14] got started and they actually rose to a
[11:18] significant portion of of the voter
[11:20] block. for example, we have NEOs. Um,
[11:22] they have been now 10 years old. So,
[11:26] they are like a 10 years old party and
[11:27] they're now in the government and they
[11:29] are now what is it the the fourth
[11:32] biggest uh the fourth biggest uh party
[11:34] in in Austria had like a 10% of all all
[11:38] the voters and 10% is a lot when the
[11:40] biggest one has 26 something like that.
[11:44] So 10% is actually a lot compared to to
[11:46] to that. So there are many examples that
[11:50] there's one party starting from zero and
[11:53] they can actually make it. There's 4%
[11:56] you have to get at least 4% to get in
[11:58] the parliament in Austria and like
[11:59] Germany and all the other ones have
[12:01] usually similar uh hurdles. You can make
[12:04] an orange party there. There are enough
[12:06] Bitcoiner, there are enough even outside
[12:08] of Bitcoin, there are probably
[12:10] technology warriors out there say like,
[12:12] "Hey, like I want the free internet. I
[12:15] want the free technology and I want to
[12:16] use it the way I want to use it." And
[12:18] there there might even be people that
[12:20] don't like Bitcoin in there that still
[12:22] would vote that party. Yeah. Yeah. And
[12:24] like that's kind of where the solidarity
[12:26] would come from is look like like
[12:27] Bitcoin is one of the tools that we're
[12:29] going to use for our people, but this is
[12:31] really about like an internet first and
[12:33] forward party that's going to use this
[12:35] to respect people's rights. Uh and I
[12:38] think like one of the things is is that
[12:39] like it needs to go to a very centrist
[12:41] position as opposed to being liberal or
[12:43] conservative to pull from both sides of
[12:45] the party. Uh and my experience
[12:47] culturally with Austrians have been like
[12:49] I I think you guys are primed and ready
[12:51] for it. And the difference is is that uh
[12:53] like any traditional political party,
[12:54] you're going to kind of struggle to find
[12:56] funding. But like if you had a radical
[12:59] party like this, I think it would get
[13:01] bankrolled pretty easily and quickly,
[13:03] very similar to what Bailey did here in
[13:04] the United States. The difference is
[13:06] that uh with there being a higher
[13:08] concentration of Bitcoiners in the
[13:10] United States and also that we have this
[13:12] idiotic two-party system, we just had to
[13:15] have uh like essentially a highly
[13:18] concentrated amount of capital to get
[13:20] done what was done. And I mean like
[13:22] Bailey helped Trump raise like a half
[13:24] billion dollars or like some insane
[13:26] amount of money which like definitely
[13:28] got his attention which is why you know
[13:30] last year he went to the Bitcoin
[13:32] conference and spoke and said all these
[13:34] positive things about Bitcoin. And it's
[13:35] not like Trump isn't ideologically
[13:39] aligned with us in any meaningful way.
[13:41] Like he he he's the most sick of person
[13:43] that's ever existed. Like he just gives
[13:45] a about himself and getting more
[13:47] money for himself. and it turns out that
[13:50] like we happen to have money and if he's
[13:52] willing to listen to us and help us out
[13:54] like that's a good thing. And like I
[13:56] don't I don't necessarily think an SBR
[13:58] for the United States is the right
[14:00] choice or the way that they're trying to
[14:01] go about doing it's the right choice but
[14:03] like uh on the last podcast I did with
[14:06] Danny Nolles on what Bitcoin did. talked
[14:08] about like the Trojan horse of Bitcoin.
[14:10] And to me, like that's what's going on
[14:11] is just getting this in front of people
[14:12] and paying attention to it is way more
[14:15] important because there's a whole
[14:17] contingency of people that go, "Wait a
[14:18] minute." So like, you can't actually
[14:20] stop this Bitcoin thing. Like even if
[14:21] the government owns it, they can't like
[14:23] seize other people's Bitcoin. Like tell
[14:25] me more. Like that's pretty interesting.
[14:27] So, like I I feel more bullish than I've
[14:30] ever felt before because Bitcoin's
[14:32] finally entering into the dialogue of
[14:34] like what is this in terms of the
[14:36] political that it has? And and when I
[14:39] say the political, like I'm not just
[14:40] talking about political parties anymore.
[14:43] I'm talking about this truly
[14:45] revolutionary idea that like politics is
[14:48] the entirety of how we relate to each
[14:50] other socially. and how can we use this
[14:53] object to radicalize and overcome the
[14:56] current forms of government and the pol
[14:59] like the polit the the politics that
[15:01] that we've all been sort of subjected
[15:03] to. That's interesting. Like the
[15:05] strategic Bitcoin reserve, the the SPR
[15:08] as a Trojan horse. Would you also count
[15:11] ETFs and
[15:12] institutional instruments as an as an
[15:15] Trojan horse for that in a particular
[15:18] way? Because like the interesting thing
[15:19] is is like by them essentially realizing
[15:21] that Bitcoin is like the preeminent uh
[15:24] like storage of value object like that
[15:27] it's a hierarchical thing. So it means
[15:29] like they have to see and understand
[15:30] that Bitcoin is more important and a
[15:32] better storage of value than real estate
[15:34] or bonds or any other thing. So in that
[15:38] it means like they have to dump the real
[15:39] estate. they have to dump the bonds and
[15:41] like bonds like that's supposed to be a
[15:44] core storage of value for people over
[15:47] the long term and if there's something
[15:49] that is better and superior to that and
[15:51] people start dumping it like this is
[15:53] part of the Trojan horse is that like if
[15:55] you're trying to tell people well you
[15:56] have to own bonds because you know uh
[15:59] it's important to the financial system
[16:00] you go but there's this other thing that
[16:02] has you know uh 25% cargill over the
[16:06] last 10 years like why why shouldn't I
[16:09] choose that over this one, it creates an
[16:11] inherent problem. And so it's like to to
[16:13] me like the the the Trojan horse is
[16:15] actually displaying the real value that
[16:17] Bitcoin has over everything else. And
[16:20] subjectively, people will end up
[16:21] choosing that. And very much like ETFs,
[16:24] SB, SB, everything else that causes for
[16:27] the dollar to collapse or other fiat
[16:29] systems to collapse because of that
[16:30] choice. And that's sort of how uh you
[16:33] give them enough rope to hang
[16:34] themselves. And and so like that seems
[16:37] to be playing out pretty perfectly right
[16:39] now. And so uh very much in in the ideas
[16:43] of Odell, I'd say like we're pretty much
[16:46] going to follow the mandibles path of
[16:48] that like we will go into a highly
[16:50] inflationary environment over the next
[16:52] 10 years. And that's explicitly going to
[16:54] be because so many people recognize how
[16:56] much more powerful and better a storage
[16:58] of value Bitcoin is over everything
[17:00] else.
[17:01] I I love the sentence, you give them
[17:03] enough rope to hang themselves. Yeah.
[17:06] And like that's sort of what is
[17:08] happening, you know? Um, and I find it
[17:11] pretty exciting. And it doesn't mean
[17:13] that like the the shifts that are going
[17:15] to happen within this aren't going to be
[17:16] very tumultuous, but like that's just
[17:18] sort of where we're at in terms of the
[17:20] system that we inherited and how long
[17:22] we've kicked this can down the road. I
[17:24] have an interesting question that just
[17:25] came up uh that I've never even thought
[17:27] about. What do you think before the
[17:30] election, let's say Trump wouldn't have
[17:33] discovered Bitcoin, but or Bailey did
[17:36] not go went to Trump and and went to
[17:38] Harris and uh Harris would have been the
[17:41] one that would have been pro Bitcoin
[17:43] like almost really hard to to imagine?
[17:46] But would have would have that been even
[17:49] possible? Like do you think Bitcoiners
[17:51] would have also rallied behind Harris uh
[17:55] more if she would have had the same
[17:57] policies except Bitcoin really
[18:00] aggressively like oh I make a strategic
[18:01] Bitcoin reserve and all the same things
[18:03] that that Trump said? Uh I mean like in
[18:06] theoretic like theoretically if we could
[18:09] magically make that happen sure but like
[18:12] they're trying to deal with the entire
[18:14] bulk of like what liberalism represents
[18:17] at this point in time in America. like
[18:19] it just doesn't align. Uh, also there
[18:22] there's like some pretty deep right-wing
[18:24] reactionary stuff that's going on inside
[18:27] of American Bitcoin just cuz like with
[18:29] it being an unstoppable thing like
[18:31] there's been, you know, plenty of
[18:33] individuals that that would probably
[18:35] identify as being uh like far right that
[18:39] have been integrated into Bitcoin and
[18:41] their ideas, I don't want to necessarily
[18:42] say welcome, but at least tolerated
[18:44] because of what and how Bitcoin
[18:46] functions. And I very much see it much
[18:48] more it's in an American conservative
[18:51] contingency because like one thing that
[18:52] Bitcoiners tend to be unlike myself that
[18:55] like I'm pretty big on is like I'm I'm
[18:57] like a huge gun ownership and gun rights
[18:59] person. Like I I think it's absurdest
[19:02] that anybody wants to restrict those
[19:04] rights. And I also find it deeply ironic
[19:07] that
[19:08] uh well like th those go really well
[19:11] together with Bitcoin. So, it's like
[19:12] Bitcoin doesn't really fit into the
[19:15] leftist perspective. And it's not to say
[19:17] that that like
[19:19] uh it can't get there, but it's more of
[19:21] that like the contemporary political
[19:23] dialogue is so oppositional to it that
[19:27] uh it's really difficult to get through
[19:28] to people. And so, like a a perfect
[19:30] example is people being like, "Oh, like
[19:32] Bitcoin wastes energy." And like I'm
[19:34] always kind of confounded when I say
[19:35] that cuz like my first question to them
[19:37] is I'm like, "Oh, like you it sounds
[19:38] like you know a lot about energy
[19:40] markets. Like I'm really curious. What
[19:41] do you think we should do with
[19:42] negatively priced energy when say like a
[19:44] windstorm comes through to a wind farm
[19:47] and they have too much energy on hand
[19:49] and they have to actually sell that
[19:50] energy to get it off? Like what do you
[19:52] think we should do with all that extra
[19:54] energy? And usually the first question I
[19:56] get is, "Huh?" And I go, "Oh, like with
[20:00] you having really strong opinions about
[20:02] Bitcoin mining and how wasteful it is, I
[20:04] thought you knew something about how
[20:06] energy markets function." But it sounds
[20:09] like you actually have just been
[20:10] listening to the talking heads on the
[20:12] television telling you how bad it is and
[20:14] you don't understand this issue at all,
[20:16] do you? Uh, and it's kind of
[20:18] embarrassing for everybody because like
[20:20] that's really the truth about American
[20:22] politics at this point in time is every
[20:23] everybody is highly uninformed, have
[20:26] very shallow viewpoints but believe that
[20:29] they have a depth of those viewpoints
[20:30] because of uh the talking points they've
[20:33] been given. So I think if Harris had
[20:36] done something similar to a strategic
[20:37] Bitcoin reserve, you know, like I I
[20:39] think it would be welcomed, but I think
[20:42] there would be very deep suspicion in
[20:44] addition to the fact of that uh like I
[20:45] think it would kind of fissure and
[20:47] fracture Bitcoin Bitcoiners more than
[20:49] with Trump because I think for for the
[20:51] most part we're ready to have them
[20:53] integrate us, but I think we'd be thrown
[20:55] for a loop with somebody like Harris cuz
[20:57] like even if Harris was like, I want an
[20:59] SPR and I also want to make sure there's
[21:01] an assault weapons ban, I'd be like,
[21:03]  her. Like I have like I don't give
[21:04] a if they have an SPR if they're
[21:06] trying to take my guns away because like
[21:09] what's the point of Bitcoin becoming our
[21:11] national currency if my government can
[21:12] just come to my house and steal
[21:14] it from me. So um good question but yeah
[21:17] like it's pretty out there in terms of
[21:20] the possibility of it happening. Yeah, I
[21:22] think there's some contradictionary uh
[21:24] points in there which is which is
[21:26] interesting and to the point I love that
[21:29] so much critical thinking because I've I
[21:32] see it all the time outside Bitcoin
[21:34] inside Bitcoin like in mainstream media
[21:36] with especially outside of of the
[21:38] Bitcoin community but also inside some
[21:41] people have beliefs and they really go
[21:44] for that those beliefs and then you ask
[21:47] them why. And after the fourth time like
[21:50] go going deeper and deeper and asking
[21:52] why you actually discover oh they don't
[21:54] know anything more like they have like a
[21:56] surface level understanding of something
[21:59] they have a very strong belief but the
[22:01] second level or the third level there's
[22:03] there's no more information there so
[22:05] like asking why for example if if
[22:07] someone says like oh like that's why I
[22:08] don't like Bitcoin and then you ask why
[22:10] then they have some one thing then you
[22:12] ask again why there's usually no no more
[22:15] information left in in the brain for So
[22:17] it's it's it's almost a critical
[22:19] thinking crisis. Do you think? Oh yeah.
[22:21] Yeah. Do you think Bitcoin can support
[22:24] critical thinking? Do you think like
[22:26] Bitcoin has an has an impact positively
[22:29] uh on on on on people on that? Yeah.
[22:32] Like I kind of actually think that like
[22:34] that's its secret weapon it uses at the
[22:36] end of the day is because like you're
[22:37] you're really forced into a number of
[22:39] these prisoners dilemmas where like you
[22:41] have to think outside of the box. And
[22:43] like that's what really hooked me on
[22:45] Bitcoin early on was like being forced
[22:47] to be like, "Okay, so there's like magic
[22:50] internet money. Like why the does
[22:52] it work? Is it actually magical?" And
[22:54] then like I like dug into cryptography
[22:55] and I'm like, "Oh, like so there's a way
[22:57] to make like an unbreakable password.
[22:59] Like how the does that work?" Like
[23:01] go deeper down that rabbit hole. I'm
[23:02] like, "Oh wow." Like it turns out that
[23:04] like when you have a number that's like
[23:06] 2 to the you know 56th power that like
[23:08] that's such a big number that like
[23:10] trying to find it's like trying to find
[23:11] a unique atom in the universe. It's like
[23:14] holy And so like each successive
[23:16] step and also like this is the
[23:18] importance of the humility of being able
[23:20] to come to it and be like well like I I
[23:21] don't know like I don't I don't know
[23:23] enough about Bitcoin to make a judgment
[23:25] about it. So like let's dig into it.
[23:26] like let's do our homework and really do
[23:29] the proof of work to display what we
[23:31] know is going on. And I think that's
[23:34] what is happening for a lot of people
[23:36] because they go okay so like the euro
[23:39] like how many of them are there? Like oh
[23:41] I don't know they can just like freely
[23:43] make as many euros as they want. Okay
[23:46] like this Bitcoin thing like oh I can
[23:47] like see that there's like only 20
[23:49] million coins right now. Huh. Okay. Like
[23:52] let's also look at like why like what's
[23:54] this proofof work thing? how and why is
[23:56] it going? And at any point here in this
[23:58] chain of reasoning, we can just like
[23:59] drop it and be like, "Fuck it. This is
[24:01] too hard. I don't care. I don't need to
[24:03] do it." Um, and it goes all the way back
[24:06] to like really in my book, I'm very
[24:08] pedantic about this idea that Hobbes put
[24:12] forward in the nation state that like
[24:13] the real power that the sovereign has is
[24:16] authority. And he surmises this as
[24:19] authority, not truth, is the creator of
[24:21] legitimacy. And like that's how the
[24:23] state has functioned for the last 500
[24:25] years. That's how it creates fiat money.
[24:28] Like that's literally what fiat means is
[24:30] by decree. And so when that dictim gets
[24:34] inverted through cryptography where
[24:36] truth not authority becomes a purveyor
[24:39] of legitimacy, things transform in a
[24:42] fundamental way where like you have to
[24:43] use logic in order to be able to come to
[24:46] the truth of things as opposed to using
[24:50] authority to listen to the decrees of
[24:53] the law to like find what the truth is.
[24:56] And so I think we're going through a
[24:57] pretty radical process because really
[25:00] what's happened over the last 5 years is
[25:02] that like I think co activated something
[25:04] in a lot of people for them to realize
[25:06] that like we can actually just be
[25:09] outright lied to about a bunch of stuff
[25:11] and trying to find that information from
[25:13] the authorities will never come. And I
[25:16] think from the experience a lot of
[25:17] people had from that they got primed to
[25:20] actually go hang on like the government
[25:21] might actually be lying to us and might
[25:24] not have our best interest at hand. And
[25:26] if that is true, how do we figure out
[25:29] things for ourselves and I think that's
[25:31] sort of the concourse that a lot of
[25:32] Bitcoiners have followed. And I think
[25:35] that's why it's so powerful is that like
[25:37] this really is just a path of critical
[25:40] thinking. And I think anybody who does
[25:42] seriously take on Bitcoin as a project
[25:45] for critical thinking almost universally
[25:48] those people become Bitcoiners because
[25:51] well that's just what the truth is. Do
[25:54] what do you think is the role of Bitcoin
[25:57] when we look back like let's say
[25:58] thousand years in the future and they
[26:02] look back what do you think the role of
[26:04] Bitcoin will be in terms of freedom? how
[26:06] important this technology was for for
[26:08] freedom overall. Say that one more time.
[26:10] The freedom for what?
[26:13] Um my question is like what is the role
[26:16] of Bitcoin? How important is Bitcoin for
[26:19] freedom overall when we look at the
[26:22] broader scale of things? Uh I think
[26:24] outside of the internet and cryptography
[26:27] itself, it's probably the most important
[26:29] thing because like without economic
[26:31] freedom, there's not you can't really
[26:33] have political freedom. you can't really
[26:35] have uh freedom of thought. Like there
[26:37] there's a whole series of different
[26:41] things that that aren't achievable if
[26:43] you don't have the economic freedom. And
[26:46] really because of the way that you know
[26:48] like gold is highly controlled, fiat
[26:49] money is directly issued. Um I think in
[26:52] the future we go into if we don't have
[26:55] Bitcoin uh like we're we're highly
[26:59] highly controlled economically and
[27:01] CBDC's are really scary because like you
[27:04] know I could very much see in the EU
[27:07] like if you use more than you know say
[27:10] 20 lers of petrol a month that they just
[27:12] go you're cut off like you can't use any
[27:14] more petrol you're you're wasting too
[27:16] too much petrol and you hate the hate
[27:20] the environment also like we're going to
[27:21] put a fine on you as well and steal
[27:23] money out of your bank account. And it
[27:25] goes to show that like economic freedom
[27:27] kind of is one of the key precipice of
[27:31] how we create freedom for ourselves.
[27:33] Because if we can't have economic
[27:35] freedom without asking for permission
[27:37] for it like that's not freedom. That's
[27:39] something pretty different from that.
[27:42] Yeah. Like the permissionless aspect is
[27:44] the the important part of of freedom.
[27:46] without if you have to ask for
[27:48] permission then then it's it's not
[27:50] yours. You don't have like the the
[27:53] permissionless part is the most
[27:55] important part I guess. Yep. Yeah. I
[27:58] think uh I think it's really dangerous
[28:01] and scary at how many people don't
[28:03] connect that. And to me, like this is a
[28:05] large product of just sort of where
[28:07] we're at developmentally is that um I
[28:10] think a lot of people don't understand
[28:12] just how powerful the internet is in uh
[28:15] like becoming a clickbaity rage baiting
[28:18] machine that really directs thought in a
[28:20] particular direction. Um, yeah. And I
[28:24] think without something like Bitcoin to
[28:26] sort of help us counterbalance and be
[28:29] able to not only transact with each
[28:30] other, but like it's very clear to me
[28:32] that like the sort of ethos of Bitcoin
[28:35] that like uh in the way that Noster has
[28:38] sort of taken the ethos of Bitcoin and
[28:40] applied it to social media like that's
[28:42] that's sort of the bigger picture thing
[28:44] that we need is because uh like I see
[28:47] two very distinct futures in front of
[28:49] us. One is essentially uh we get like
[28:52] Chinese style technological panopticon
[28:55] where everyone's surveiled all the time
[28:57] for whatever reason and you never
[29:00] actually know whether or not you're
[29:01] being surveiled. The other one is we
[29:04] essentially invert these technologies on
[29:06] their head. Encrypt everything across
[29:08] the board. Social media communications
[29:10] all those platforms blind the apparatus.
[29:14] Uh and furthermore through the creation
[29:16] of that there becomes uh totally new
[29:20] methodologies of being able to share
[29:22] information and data sets through stuff
[29:24] like homorphic encryption. And I think
[29:26] we get a really really powerful vehicle
[29:30] uh that frankly also becomes like the
[29:32] new political apparatus of like how we
[29:35] solve the technological problems that
[29:37] seem to be facing society today. I love
[29:40] I love that. I I sometimes
[29:42] have sometimes have
[29:44] difficult difficulty imagining how
[29:47] Noster will gain mass adoption. Like I I
[29:52] get Bitcoin because like it has an uh
[29:55] incentive there. People usually come in
[29:57] for Namog technology. You have a
[29:59] financial incentive to actually look
[30:00] into Bitcoin and and and have
[30:02] that. I I'm not sure if that same thing
[30:05] will happen with with NOS. like what's
[30:07] the what do you think is the biggest
[30:08] incentive driver that will will will
[30:11] will put people into Nostra and and yeah
[30:15] decentralized uh things like that
[30:19] uh when creators truly uh demand that
[30:23] they own their own content and be
[30:25] absolutely refusing in compromising on
[30:28] that like I think if you get a handful
[30:31] uh and like this is a place that I found
[30:32] repeated frustration is that
[30:34] like like I I'm not interested in
[30:39] uh and this is sort of true on a whole
[30:41] is like I'm not really interested in
[30:43] mass adoption like like slaves are
[30:45] really interested in their slavery
[30:47] because like slavery is super appealing
[30:49] like yeah why should I like go and start
[30:52] my own business and take a risk where
[30:54] like I could be poor at the end like why
[30:56] why don't I just like sign up for
[30:57] slavery pay my like put in my 40 hours a
[31:00] week I get the paycheck I'll pay my
[31:03] taxes I won't rock the boat I'm like I
[31:06] have to worry about now. Like I I'm
[31:08] like free enough. I like get my food.
[31:11] Stuff's okay. Um and so stuff like No,
[31:14] like I'm not I'm not interested in being
[31:16] like, "Hey everybody, like come over to
[31:18] Noster. Your freedom." Like I'm
[31:19] interested in artists being like, "I got
[31:20]  over on TikTok. I know they're
[31:22] going to me over again. I'll never
[31:24] put myself in a position to get
[31:26] like that. I'm going to produce
[31:28] everything on Nostaster. I'm going to
[31:30] stream stuff directly to uh my fans. I
[31:34] want a peer-to-peer relationship with
[31:36] them where they'll zap me, I put out
[31:38] music, my music's free for anybody to
[31:41] have access to. Uh, and and to me, like
[31:44] that's what I think everything comes
[31:46] down to is that's why these
[31:48] permissionbased systems are so dangerous
[31:50] is that, you know, any point in time, I
[31:52] can get cancelceled on Twitter, you can
[31:53] get canceled on Tik Tok, you can get
[31:55] kicked off Facebook, that can't happen
[31:57] on no sir. And so I think on a long
[31:59] enough time scale people start to really
[32:02] understand that you know same reason why
[32:05] uh I think stuff like elemental matrix
[32:07] and signal are becoming more popular and
[32:09] I think people will move from signal to
[32:11] something like elemental matrix is that
[32:13] like on a long enough time scale you
[32:15] eventually give a about your
[32:16] privacy and I think anybody that's like
[32:19] well people don't care about privacy
[32:20] it's that they don't care about privacy
[32:22] yet and like there is an event in the
[32:25] future where because you have
[32:27] compromised on your privacy like you're
[32:29] going to get over. And the
[32:31] question is is how many people is that
[32:33] going to happen to until people go, you
[32:35] know, I really shouldn't give all my
[32:37] information to a centralized server that
[32:39] can just steal it at any point in time.
[32:41] Um, and so like that's kind of where my
[32:43] hope comes for while where we'll get
[32:45] adoption at. Uh, and my truth is also
[32:48] like I'm I'm I'm very sincerely
[32:51] unconcerned with 90% of people because
[32:53] like those 90% I can convince to jump
[32:55] off a bridge if we give them enough
[32:57] propaganda. And so like
[33:00] they're they they don't have enough uh
[33:03] consistency or a spine about them to
[33:05] really make real choices, you know, like
[33:08] they're sort of lemmings in a lot of
[33:10] ways. So, I'm much more concerned with
[33:12] the 10% that can actually be
[33:13] meaningfully influenced and make changes
[33:15] for themselves because they want to
[33:17] self- advocate.
[33:20] Uh, I I know Signal and and and there
[33:23] are some some people that tell me I
[33:25] should move to sessions from Signal.
[33:28] What What was the other thing that you
[33:29] mentioned? What was that? Uh, Elemental
[33:32] Matrix. Like it's Yeah, it's a newer
[33:36] one, but like
[33:37] uh like our siso, another friend
[33:40] presents me to it before and then our
[33:42] siso when we originally met him and he
[33:44] was like, "Oh, like are you on elemental
[33:46] matrix?" We were like, "Oh yeah, we
[33:47] are." And he was like, "Yeah, like use
[33:49] that over signal." Um like signal, yeah,
[33:52] for the most part, like I think Signal's
[33:54] pawned. Uh and I think it's sort of
[33:57] dangerous, particularly if you're doing
[33:58] pretty high level Um, like I think
[34:02] for kind of everyday interactions, it
[34:04] works relatively well. But this is also
[34:07] sort of what the greater political
[34:08] concourse that we need to go to is is
[34:10] that
[34:11] like the internet right now, as far as I
[34:14] see it, like it's fundamentally broken.
[34:16] You know, like right now we're using
[34:17] Riverside to stream that's owned by
[34:20] Riverside. At any point in time,
[34:21] Riverside can be like, "Hey, you guys
[34:23] talked about Nazism. Like that's not a
[34:26] Riverside value. So like, you. You
[34:28] guys can't use this anymore." And like
[34:30] that's not there's no sort of legal
[34:32] agreement here or any reason why they
[34:34] can't kick us off the platform. And so
[34:36] the difference is is that I think we
[34:38] eventually get to a place where
[34:40] everything becomes highly controlled
[34:41] like that and that you will get kicked
[34:43] off Riverside for those sort of
[34:44] dialogues. And like the question is is
[34:47] that a value that actually aligns with
[34:49] us that we want to have in the world and
[34:51] I think the answer is universally no but
[34:53] I think there haven't been the
[34:54] technological solutions to address it
[34:56] yet. And with that being said, like I
[34:58] also think the greatest market
[35:00] opportunities that have ever existed are
[35:03] coming about right now in creating the
[35:06] solutions that decentralize and
[35:08] opensource pretty much all of the
[35:10] different things that we need. And no is
[35:12] just one example of that. you know, like
[35:15] uh I think Keep like they're an open-
[35:17] source uh product that like they like
[35:19] they have pretty great web streaming and
[35:21] I think eventually we find all of these
[35:23] sort of decentralized products web these
[35:26] products and web services that will run
[35:28] on top of Bitcoin and allow for them to
[35:30] exist in a decentralized way so that
[35:32] nobody can actually like shut down what
[35:34] you're doing or take your media from.
[35:36] Let's take a break for a moment and
[35:38] appreciate the beauty that coin
[35:40] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[35:43] watches. Those watches are the most
[35:45] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[35:48] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner
[35:51] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[35:53] completely new and amazing Genesis
[35:56] edition of their watch collections. You
[35:59] have the date of the first ever mined
[36:02] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[36:04] also the block height and which epoch we
[36:07] are currently in. I love the level of
[36:10] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[36:13] Make sure to check out those amazing
[36:15] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[36:18] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[36:21] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[36:24] really do hope that you don't have it on
[36:26] exchange. But if you do have it on
[36:28] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[36:30] deal with that. The first way is you put
[36:32] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[36:34] entry for you to get into the
[36:37] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[36:40] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[36:43] super simple and secure way. And if you
[36:46] check out the link in the description,
[36:48] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[36:51] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[36:54] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[36:57] partner in terms of how to get the most
[37:00] out of your sovereignty. They will
[37:02] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[37:05] that is perfect for your individual
[37:08] situation. They will show you how you
[37:10] can secure your own devices. Securing
[37:13] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[37:15] have to keep all your devices secure.
[37:18] One topic that is overlooked often is
[37:20] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[37:23] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[37:26] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[37:28] place already? And last but not least,
[37:30] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[37:32] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[37:35] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[37:40] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[37:43] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[37:46] be for the first time ever speaking at
[37:48] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[37:51] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[37:53] really looking forward to seeing all of
[37:55] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:58] the link down in the description of
[38:00] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[38:02] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[38:06] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[38:08] there. That's like almost a a new form
[38:10] of the internet and and like we we
[38:14] started the internet all of the sudden
[38:15] there's big corporations and government
[38:18] co-opted it and now we have to figure
[38:20] out how we can how we make it in a non
[38:24] manipulated way. So essential
[38:26] authorities cannot even co-opt it. Yeah.
[38:29] And like to be clear it started as both
[38:32] a government and corporate project. It
[38:34] like never was not that. But it's also
[38:36] with what uh asymmetric cryptography and
[38:40] peer-to-peer technologies provide and
[38:42] created sort of uh in in a pretty
[38:45] interesting and different way. There's a
[38:46] massive opportunity to be able to do
[38:49] that. And to me like the creation of
[38:51] that new structure of the internet like
[38:53] is the political apparatus of the future
[38:57] because like once we sort of get that
[38:59] and we have all of our technologies and
[39:01] services built on these decentralized
[39:03] federated layers uh like the nation
[39:06] state starts to matter a whole lot less
[39:09] and their ability to enforce empower and
[39:11] also just straight up steal and punish
[39:13] you also becomes a lot less. You also
[39:15] become much more empowered because you
[39:18] now have very real privacy that allows
[39:21] for you to selectively reveal uh your
[39:24] identity in the context that you choose
[39:25] to do, you You know, and for me, like
[39:27] this was one of the things that really
[39:30] orange pulled me pretty hard when I
[39:31] learned about it was like when I first
[39:33] learned about the Silk Road. And I was
[39:34] like, wait, like I was like, hold up,
[39:37] you can use magic internet money to like
[39:39] buy drugs on the internet and like cops
[39:41] aren't going to show up to your house
[39:43] and hurt you. And I was like, this is
[39:46] probably one of the most important
[39:47] developments of the 21st century because
[39:49] like not only are people getting uh
[39:52] well- tested drugs that aren't polluted
[39:55] in ways that could very actively kill
[39:58] people, but now there's this provable
[40:00] method that like you can do stuff that
[40:02] your government doesn't want you to do
[40:05] and they can't stop you. And I was like,
[40:07] whoa. All right, there's something
[40:09] really powerful and important going on
[40:10] here and I should dig deeper into it.
[40:12] And whatever your feelings about drugs
[40:14] could be, it's more about what does it
[40:16] mean that you know uh you can have a
[40:18] Christian in Pakistan can buy a Bible
[40:20] now and like they're not going to get
[40:22]  murdered for it. Like that's
[40:24] pretty important. Same thing woman in
[40:26] Pakistan who's in an abusive
[40:28] relationship and isn't allowed money.
[40:30] She can actually get Bitcoin on her own
[40:31] and use that to get herself out of the
[40:33] country. And like to me those are the
[40:35] most important developments because now
[40:37] we have this whole class of people who
[40:39] have not been able to access very basic
[40:42] what we would call human rights can
[40:45] actually do that on their own purview
[40:46] and choose to do that for themselves and
[40:49] nobody can stop them. Yeah, that's
[40:51] that's pretty powerful. That's really
[40:53] powerful. I had an African woman uh on
[40:56] the podcast who basically was exactly
[40:58] going through that uh journey with um
[41:03] with her husband and she shared that
[41:05] story and she was like she had no way of
[41:08] getting any money outside of Bitcoin
[41:10] because all the bank accounts were
[41:11] controlled by the husband. Everything
[41:13] was controlled by the husband and
[41:14] Bitcoin was the only small escape patch
[41:17] where she was like, "Oh, I I can save in
[41:19] that that that's the only thing that I
[41:21] can control and nobody can take away
[41:23] from me because the bank will not give
[41:26] me anything because they know the
[41:27] husband doesn't want that." And I'm like
[41:30] like a guy a guy living up in Austria is
[41:33] that's really foreign for me because in
[41:35] Austria it works differently. But it
[41:37] opens your mind to how far how important
[41:40] Bitcoin is outside of just storing
[41:43] value. Yeah. And like my honest truth is
[41:46] like I don't give a about the
[41:47] storage of value dialogue or the Michael
[41:49] Sailors or the number go up. Like to to
[41:52] me Bitcoin is universally for the global
[41:54] south. Like this is for pe you know one
[41:56] out of two people in the world don't
[41:58] have access to banking services. Every
[42:00] other person on the planet can't even
[42:02] get their hands on any meaningful money.
[42:05] And then when you look at, you know,
[42:06] outside of the G7 country, it's like
[42:09] most countries have a national currency
[42:10] that's so inflationary, it loses
[42:13] half of its purchasing power over the
[42:15] course of a decade. So it's like there's
[42:18] this gigantic sucking noise that's going
[42:20] on to the entire global economy, most
[42:23] particularly the global south. I mean
[42:25] like like remittances to to places like
[42:28] the Philippines suck up like 10% of GBDP
[42:31] or some insane amount of money like what
[42:35] happens when we actually distribute that
[42:37] money back to the people who are trying
[42:38] to earn it who are also the poorest
[42:40] people in the world you know like uh
[42:43] these are the most important things cuz
[42:45] also like there are Mozarts and
[42:47] Einsteins out there who like are going
[42:49] to be needing to work in coal mines most
[42:52] their life just because they don't have
[42:54] access to the most basic human services.
[42:56] And so like now there's an opportunity
[42:58] to transform and change that in a
[43:01] meaningful way. And like that's again
[43:03] that goes back to this capital T capital
[43:05] P political thing is that like the
[43:08] political is getting those people on
[43:10] board. It's being in solidarity with
[43:12] them of saying, "Hey, I want you to have
[43:14] the ability to escape your abusive
[43:16] relationship in Africa and like I want
[43:19] you to be able to use the Bitcoin
[43:21] network and have access to the same
[43:22] cryptography that I have access to." And
[43:25] it's through that solidarity that I
[43:27] think we do actually get a new
[43:30] global movement. And it's sort of funny
[43:32] like part of my political perspective is
[43:34] that like we're watching this really
[43:36] insane synthesis of like all prior
[43:38] political theories where like uh and
[43:40] this is sort of Allah Alexander Dugan is
[43:43] that like he presents in the fourth
[43:45] political theory that like there is this
[43:47] sort of future form of politics and I
[43:50] think that future form of politics is
[43:52] explicitly comes through revolutionary
[43:54] syndicicalism and what we can do when we
[43:57] choose to create a revolutionary
[43:59] syndicate through the internet using
[44:01] Bitcoin as like its fundamental practice
[44:04] of how it implements it. Do you think
[44:06] that number go up
[44:08] technology might be a distraction when
[44:11] so many people come in and like ETF
[44:13] tracking the the numbers there and and
[44:15] kind of getting really focused on on
[44:17] just how how many percentage Bitcoin
[44:20] grew last last week and stuff like that.
[44:24] Uh, it's hard to say and like this is
[44:26] more the Trojan horse thing is that
[44:28] like getting financial bros on board to
[44:32] give a about Bitcoin because number
[44:33] go up is in solidarity with like Bitcoin
[44:37] as being a peer-to-peer payment system
[44:38] that anybody can access anywhere. And so
[44:41] to me, like this is sort of the great
[44:43] irony of what Bitcoin does is that like
[44:45] it gets a solidarity between these two
[44:47] people who probably wouldn't have been
[44:49] on board with each other in the first
[44:51] place. And and so like I personally do
[44:54] find it distracting uh and like a little
[44:57] gross too cuz like uh yeah like it I I'm
[45:01] not terribly like there's plenty of ways
[45:03] to go make money. Uh, and like if you're
[45:06] just interested in trading Bitcoin to
[45:07] make money, like I don't I don't really
[45:09] think we're ethically aligned. But if
[45:12] you want Bitcoin to be
[45:13] successful because number go up is like
[45:16] a great thing for people on a whole
[45:18] because like what does it mean to have
[45:20] deflationary money and government not to
[45:21] have control of it and the ability to be
[45:23] self- sovereign with it? Like I think
[45:25] there's greater solidarity there. And
[45:27] also like I think that this is sort of
[45:29] the concourse of that critical thinking
[45:31] coming across the board in different
[45:33] ways. And so that like this is allowing
[45:35] for financial bros to be like, "Oh, like
[45:38] it turns out like having a money that
[45:40] nobody control is actually like a really
[45:43] great thing on an economic level." I'm
[45:45] like, "Huh, I'd never really considered
[45:47] that before." Like maybe this is
[45:48] actually better than bonds or gold.
[45:50] There's
[45:52] this when I look at Bitcoin, there are
[45:55] external factors like external wars
[45:59] happening towards Bitcoin, but there's
[46:00] also internal wars like the the block
[46:03] size war
[46:04] happening. What do you see as the
[46:07] biggest
[46:08] external threat or external war that is
[46:12] is is coming towards Bitcoin or is is
[46:14] already at at Bitcoin? uh externally I
[46:17] think it's really just kind of uh how
[46:21] much the nation state is paying more
[46:23] attention to it and this is one of the
[46:25] reasons I don't like SPR is because like
[46:27] if the government is holding like a half
[46:29] million bitcoin that becomes sort of an
[46:32] external pressure that like now they can
[46:34] start to influence core devs they can
[46:36] start pushing forward the the sort of
[46:38] developments that they would like to see
[46:40] forked in um and I think that causes for
[46:43] like a doubling down on the oification
[46:46] dialogue and like I'm not sure if we're
[46:48] ready for
[46:49] oification, but like maybe that's not
[46:51] actually a choice that we have anymore.
[46:54] Um, in addition to like
[46:57] uh like I think it's like the 2096 bug
[47:00] or whatever is that like we like there
[47:02] does have to be another hard fork at
[47:05] some point in time in Bitcoin if we
[47:08] don't want that critical failure to come
[47:10] about. And so like internally there is
[47:13] this problem in dialogue of like how do
[47:16] we actually solve that and get a hard
[47:18] fork and not have it become highly
[47:21] contentious and political in that time.
[47:24] Uh and like I don't actually know how
[47:26] that solves itself and I and like that's
[47:29] pretty concerning in addition to like
[47:31] now there's this outsized outside
[47:33] influence by nation states that like
[47:35] perhaps they use that as a way to
[47:37] pressure and try to integrate changes Uh
[47:41] and more importantly like there's uh any
[47:43] changes that do happen now are so highly
[47:47] focused and there's such great risk that
[47:50] comes about with creating changes to
[47:52] Bitcoin right now that like uh yeah I
[47:54] just find them areas that I do have
[47:57] concerns about. Not to say that they
[47:58] can't be overcome but like it's a pretty
[48:01] high pressure situation.
[48:04] Yeah. is this this this thing of there's
[48:06] a running system and we have to upgrade
[48:10] it but every upgrade also brings a big
[48:12] risk in in what if what if we introduce
[48:16] something that's actually not good for
[48:17] it. So I it's it's a it's a it it's a
[48:22] concerning situation but honestly I I do
[48:24] think we we will get through that. I
[48:27] think so too. And I mean like to to me
[48:30] one of the more exciting things is is
[48:32] that like
[48:34] uh I mean like the development of like
[48:37] the whole Bitcoin podcasting space has
[48:40] really only been something over the last
[48:41] you know five to seven years and Bitcoin
[48:45] itself is only 16 years old like that
[48:47] this whole thing is really really young
[48:49] still and that's why I want to see this
[48:52] sort of uh political development come
[48:55] out of it cuz to me like it obviously is
[48:57] very polit political and I think without
[49:00] a strong political
[49:03] ideological intellectual approach to
[49:05] like what's going on here, why isn't it
[49:08] important and why do we want this to be
[49:10] something that is part of our lives? I
[49:13] think without that uh like Bitcoin can
[49:16] just become a high-powered banker's tool
[49:18] and like I don't think that that's what
[49:20] its destiny desires for it. But I also
[49:23] think that like there's a very real
[49:25] danger. It gets lost in that if there
[49:27] isn't a powerful advocacy for it from
[49:30] the sort of philosophical side.
[49:34] Yeah. The podcasting space is also
[49:35] interesting because if you look back how
[49:37] many Bitcoin like truly Bitcoin only
[49:40] podcasts were there 20 let's say 19 just
[49:44] like five six years ago and how many
[49:46] Bitcoin only podcasts are there now?
[49:48] It's the the the amount uh of Bitcoin
[49:52] only and more and more signal is really
[49:56] really greatly really really greatly uh
[49:59] increasing. I'm I'm amazed when we look
[50:02] back at like 5 years or like six seven
[50:04] years how much content there was of
[50:06] Bitcoin only. I mean if we go very far
[50:09] back there was only Bitcoin and how we
[50:12] how much we already have now. And I also
[50:14] see people that are now coming into
[50:16] Bitcoin falling way faster down the
[50:20] rabbit hole because of all that content
[50:23] than previously. I personally needed
[50:25] like three to four years to go from I
[50:28] discovered Bitcoin to actually going to
[50:30] be Bitcoin only and actually getting the
[50:32] mission. I see now people coming in 2024
[50:36] and they get it after like four or five
[50:37] months because the the content is so
[50:39] good and consumable. It's it's it's
[50:41] really really cool to see.
[50:43] Yeah. And that's like kind of part of uh
[50:46] the development of the efficiency
[50:48] because like you know a lot of us who
[50:49] were involved with this early on we
[50:51] really had to like struggle through all
[50:53] these questions on our own. There was
[50:54] very little content you know like when
[50:57] when I got started in Bitcoin there was
[50:59] really only the Bitcoin forms. There
[51:01] wasn't anything else. Uh not to mention
[51:04] like it was only up until 2017 like
[51:08] before 2017 there was no dialogue about
[51:10] shitcoin. like it was all sort of weird
[51:12] and experimental and you know there was
[51:15] feathercoin and all all sorts of
[51:17] different things that people were
[51:19] experimenting with. But it was only
[51:21] after the ICO boom when it became very
[51:23] clear that anybody could easily make a
[51:25] coin that they could engage uh in sort
[51:28] of the most disgusting of unethical
[51:31] content and just do pump and dumps that
[51:33] people like hang on like bit Bitcoin is
[51:35] supposed to be something different and
[51:37] it's not interested in being a world
[51:39] computer or even being associated with
[51:41] this greater sort of crypto thing. Uh,
[51:44] and it's ironic because like uh I I just
[51:48] I find it of the deepest irony that like
[51:50] uh like crypto is this sort of idiotic
[51:54] term at this point in time that like it
[51:56] has no relationship to
[51:59] cryptography. Uh because like everything
[52:01] that's involved in the crypto space
[52:04] doesn't have any asymmetric advantage in
[52:07] warfare which is like what cryptography
[52:09] is supposed to be about. And like that's
[52:11] why anything outside of Bitcoin can be
[52:13] inherently pawned is because like this
[52:16] relationship to cryptography itself is
[52:18] inherently broken. And it's because like
[52:21] there is no actual understanding on a
[52:23] larger level of why Bitcoin needs to use
[52:27] a cryptographic system to empower itself
[52:30] and make sure that it can't be
[52:32] compromised that every other shitcoin
[52:34] has totally up on and that like
[52:36] they're they're sort of acutely unaware
[52:39] of like in the deepest of ironies.
[52:42] Uh for me the block size war was was
[52:45] really that that was the one thing that
[52:49] I've seen in history because I got
[52:51] orange in 2020. But when I read about
[52:53] the block size wars and really went deep
[52:55] on there I was like oh that's why
[52:57] Bitcoin is strong because of the
[52:58] community because of the the the
[53:01] community that really holds true even
[53:04] though the industry is moving maybe in a
[53:06] different direction. From what I
[53:07] understood is the industry even the
[53:10] miners uh famous uh people inside move
[53:14] towards uh bigger blocks but the the
[53:17] users the full node operators the
[53:19] community of bitcoin actually was like
[53:21] oh like that does not work and it's
[53:22] really interesting also the the
[53:24] beginning side where it almost looked
[53:26] for a little bit that maybe uh bitcoin
[53:29] cash is is winning that single event is
[53:33] for me the one of the
[53:37] confident giver for me like oh like
[53:40] Bitcoin will go through hard times and
[53:42] we will probably have some fights down
[53:44] the road but I'm pretty confident in the
[53:47] community that we will get through
[53:48] there. Yeah. And like uh you know I was
[53:51] at Coinbase during the block size wars
[53:54] and because of the way it played out
[53:55] like I left the company after that cuz I
[53:57] was very upset with the decisions that
[54:00] the executive team made there. Um, but
[54:03] with that being said, it was like really
[54:04] powerful to see that there was a
[54:06] contingency that was like, no, we can't
[54:08] compromise on this principle. I think
[54:10] it's really important that it wasn't
[54:11] compromised. It's not to say that uh
[54:14] there wasn't some slide of hand
[54:16] techniques that were sort of carried out
[54:17] with integrating SegWit and other
[54:19] things, but I think it was really
[54:21] powerful that like the full display of
[54:23] what a civil war playing out in Bitcoin
[54:25] looks like, what a hard fork looks like,
[54:27] uh like how the divergence between
[54:29] different coins happens was all a really
[54:32] important feature and play. And I think
[54:34] that that serves into the future. But I
[54:37] think even more importantly what it
[54:39] underlines is like uh this ethos and
[54:43] culture of individuals that want self-s
[54:46] sovereignty like this this is at the
[54:49] apex of the cultural funnel of that like
[54:52] that's what people are striving for like
[54:54] people really want that kind of a
[54:57] culture an approach uh the technological
[55:01] capacity to be self- sovereign and so to
[55:03] me like
[55:04] uh like I'm I'm really uninterested in
[55:07] appealing to the masses. As much as I'm
[55:10] interested in pushing towards that kind
[55:11] of vision cuz like I very strongly
[55:14] believe that
[55:15] like like everyone truly is a cipher
[55:18] punk and has cippher punk ethos and
[55:20] values. They just don't know it yet. And
[55:23] it's only through that process of
[55:25] critical thinking and being forced down
[55:27] the rabbit hole that everybody does
[55:29] actually discover like, oh, these are my
[55:31] values. These are the things that I
[55:33] want. It's just, you know, we've lived
[55:35] in such a soft-handed culture for so
[55:38] long that um like most people don't even
[55:41] have their ideas challenged in any
[55:43] meaningful way. And if you do challenge
[55:46] somebody's ideas, it's supposed to be
[55:47] this con, you know, that this deeply
[55:49] emotional conflictual thing as opposed
[55:51] to being like, hold the up. Like
[55:53] it's not conflictual. It's like I like I
[55:56] believe I should have a right to own
[55:57] guns because of the genocides of the
[55:59] 20th century. You believe I don't I
[56:02] shouldn't have that right. like I'm
[56:03] really interested in like having a
[56:05] dialogue about this and we don't have to
[56:07] be angry or upset. Like this is really
[56:08] about us trying to chip down towards the
[56:12] truth. And I think most people don't
[56:15] understand that there's a way to have
[56:17] different viewpoints and opinions and
[56:20] still respect one another to be able to
[56:22] sort of discover what the truth is
[56:24] between each other. And that's something
[56:26] that I think Bitcoiners bring to the
[56:27] table as sort of a uh contentious bunch
[56:30] of people is that like we're a bit ky
[56:33] and challenging to each other. And I
[56:34] think that's really important with the
[56:36] kind of developments that we want to
[56:37] see. Do you think that emotional
[56:41] reaction when people challenge each
[56:43] other outside of Bitcoin comes from
[56:46] broken money?
[56:49] Um on sort of a tangental unrelated way.
[56:52] Yeah. like and and I think it's just
[56:54] because uh like the broken money is so
[56:56] definitive of society across the board
[56:59] that like trying to get purview into
[57:02] really anything at this point in time is
[57:04] almost impossible because of like how
[57:06] much broken money has uh really like
[57:09] highly distorted the economy in a bunch
[57:12] of different ways. in addition to like
[57:15] uh like one of the craziest things is is
[57:17] that like trying to save in fiat money
[57:19] means that you're trying to save this
[57:21] thing that's inherently evaporating
[57:23] away. So like you you everyone sort of
[57:25] has to have this paranoid schizophrenic
[57:27] view of money of that it's a super
[57:30] scarce resource that we always have to
[57:31] try to be gathering more and more of as
[57:33] opposed to a deflationary economy where
[57:36] it's like I have my one Bitcoin. I know
[57:38] it's slowly going to acrue value over
[57:40] time. It's like a real savings vehicle.
[57:43] I can like sit back, relax, and chill
[57:45] out a little bit. Uh, and so like I
[57:48] think the biggest thing about the
[57:51] inability to have these critical
[57:52] dialogues with each other is that people
[57:54] are so dialed into the propaganda
[57:56] between TV, the internet, and all the
[57:59] different apparatuses that like shove
[58:01] information into you
[58:03] that like I personally find it's pretty
[58:05] rare that you can find people present uh
[58:10] unique viewpoints particularly towards
[58:13] uh like contentious dialogues of today.
[58:16] Like like a good example is like if you
[58:18] talk to anybody about the Israeli
[58:19] Palestinian
[58:20] issue, you don't get a whole lot of
[58:24] nuance from people. You you either get a
[58:26] Zionist perspective or a Palestinian
[58:28] perspective and there's not a lot of
[58:30] like hey like there's like a lot of gray
[58:32] area and difficulties here along with
[58:34] like this whole huge history. Uh, and
[58:37] like like a good example is being here
[58:39] in the Bay Area. Like since the October
[58:42] 7th event, there's a ton of people that
[58:43] are like super pro
[58:45] Palestinian. Uh, like that's neither
[58:47] here nor there. Like the thing that kind
[58:49] of blows my mind is I want to be like
[58:51] you guys get that like this has been
[58:53] happening to the Palestinian people for
[58:54] like 70 years, right? Like this wasn't
[58:57] this event that started wasn't like
[59:01] really terribly unique within the
[59:03] Israeli Palestinian conflict. It seems
[59:05] like you're only paying attention now
[59:07] because there was this big event that
[59:09] got your attention and hooked you in.
[59:11] And because you were hooked in in that
[59:13] same way, you took pretty normalized
[59:15] path towards your understanding of it as
[59:17] opposed to like getting that like
[59:19] there's this whole gigantic history
[59:21] that's built up to this event. Um, yeah.
[59:24] Yeah. And so like I I I really think
[59:26] that the dialogue is much more of a
[59:28] product of people's exposure to
[59:30] propaganda and their inability to reason
[59:32] outside of those sort of propag.
[59:36] Yeah, it's it's super interesting. Um
[59:38] it's also because I personally don't
[59:41] have any opinion on that and it's it's
[59:43] super interesting when you when you
[59:45] bring that up. For example, when you go
[59:46] to a family gathering and there's a
[59:50] topic coming up, let's say Israeli, and
[59:52] and and people are like, "Oh, like what
[59:54] are your thoughts?" And I just say, "Oh,
[59:56] I've not looked into that. I have no
[59:58] opinion on that." People almost get
[60:00] upset like, "How can you not have an
[60:02] opinion on I have not like I've not
[60:04] looked into that? I I'm not willing to
[60:06] genocide going on, Robin. Are you a
[60:08] piece of Like, how could you not
[60:11] have an opinion about that?" and you're
[60:12] like because I haven't read into it, you
[60:16] know, and like it and that's like a good
[60:18] example is also like
[60:21] um yeah, people get so kind of
[60:24] hyperfocused on these events and sort of
[60:26] the surface level of communicating to
[60:29] one another, like trying trying to
[60:30] signal to one another that like we're on
[60:32] the same team, if you will, that like
[60:34] the actual dialogue itself is totally
[60:37] lost, you know? Um and also just like
[60:39] even trying to steal me both sides of
[60:41] like
[60:42] you know, talking to friends that are
[60:43] like pro Palestinians, like, okay, so
[60:46] like are you like a fan of a two-state
[60:48] solution or like, you know, should we
[60:50] like ethnically cleanse the Jews and
[60:52] like give the state of Palestine like
[60:54] back the Palestinian like what do we do
[60:57] here, you know? And it's kind of
[60:59] interesting because like when you try to
[61:00] actually get into the nuance of things,
[61:02] it becomes a lot more difficult. Uh, and
[61:04] like one of the places that like my own
[61:06] opinion is starting to shift and change
[61:08] about stuff is like it's also realizing
[61:11] like they're actually like bad guys out
[61:13] there. There are like people that are
[61:15] sincerely interested in like doing evil
[61:17] and harming other people and like what
[61:20] do we do about them? You know, like
[61:22] that's that's like something that we
[61:24] have to deal with as a society. And as
[61:26] an individual, it's pretty easy to like
[61:28] raise my hands and be like I'm not going
[61:29] to do violence to anybody. I'm like not
[61:31] interested in participating in a war,
[61:34] but those things might actually play out
[61:36] in a meaningful way that other people do
[61:38] have to solve. You know, for for me
[61:40] personally, it's like, you know, same
[61:42] thing with the Ukrainian war thing. Like
[61:44] that's like a big deal that people have
[61:45] strong opinions about. And I'll be like,
[61:47] look, like I really understand you don't
[61:49] like Putin. You think he's evil that we
[61:51] need to support Ukraine. Uh like why
[61:54] should my tax dollars and money be spent
[61:58] on that when I'm not interested in it?
[62:00] And frankly, like if that's true and we
[62:03] should support that, like shouldn't we
[62:05] actually like have Congress approve of
[62:07] that and like provide budget for the war
[62:10] as opposed to being an executive police
[62:12] action, you know? And a lot of people
[62:14] aren't interested in sort of this more
[62:16] nuance of conversation because it forces
[62:18] them to think in different ways. And
[62:20] it's like the moment that you get
[62:22] outside of these tracks that have been
[62:23] built for people, they're taught to sort
[62:25] of be outraged and to believe that that
[62:28] means you represent the opposite side
[62:30] when that's just like not actually the
[62:31] case. Yeah, it's it's it's so
[62:34] interesting when when you when you look
[62:36] at that and and and people get so upset.
[62:38] I think we have to normalize to just
[62:40] say, "Oh, like I I don't have an opinion
[62:41] on that and and and I will form one if I
[62:44] look into that." It's almost people want
[62:46] to have an opinion on on on things and
[62:49] I'm I'm deeply concerned deeply
[62:51] concerned with that. But um we have one
[62:54] question that I asked each and every one
[62:56] of my guests and the the question is and
[62:58] and maybe that also connects to that a
[63:01] little bit maybe what can we learn from
[63:03] you be besides Bitcoin? uh you know I
[63:06] think if you get an opportunity to check
[63:08] out my book crypto sovereignty like in
[63:10] that it takes a very deep dive into sort
[63:14] of philosophy and how that dovetales
[63:16] with cryptography itself and through
[63:19] that like there's like I very much
[63:21] believe that there is a new form of
[63:23] sovereignty that all people everywhere
[63:26] can have access to visav cryptography
[63:29] and the empowerment that cryptography
[63:31] provides in terms of the assurance of
[63:33] privacy the ability to protect your data
[63:36] and then relating to Bitcoin, the
[63:38] ability to actually self- sovereignly
[63:40] hold your Bitcoin. And like I very
[63:43] strongly believe that everyone should
[63:45] own some small amount of Bitcoin and be
[63:48] able to recover that easily and quickly
[63:50] through, you know, whether you memorize
[63:53] a seed phrase or you figure out how to
[63:55] set up uh a multi-IG that you have
[63:58] access to in multiple jurisdictions or
[64:01] whatever, but like you never know when
[64:04] uh like you're suddenly going to become
[64:06] the enemy and that you are cut off from
[64:08] your bank accounts or uh a good example
[64:10] is like here in California, we've had a
[64:12] number of fires and like I've had
[64:13] friends that have lost their homes and
[64:15] everything and like they even their bank
[64:17] burned down where you know and so like
[64:20] the only access that they had afterwards
[64:22] was to some small amount of Bitcoin that
[64:24] like they could access in this way. And
[64:26] to me like it's really about safety at
[64:28] the end of the day. like if you want to
[64:31] be safe and have access to money, you
[64:34] know, same thing with people in Ukraine,
[64:36] like there are examples of people who
[64:38] fled from both sides of that conflict
[64:40] because they had access to Bitcoin. And
[64:42] I think really thinking critically about
[64:44] you know uh you know as we started the
[64:48] the first conversation like in Austria
[64:50] that you know in the 1940s there was a
[64:53] contingency of the population the Jews
[64:55] and the Romas and those people that like
[64:57] all of their was stolen from them
[64:59] and they were shoved out of the country.
[65:01] Like
[65:02] they're
[65:04] they're those things are possibilities
[65:07] still for all people everywhere. And
[65:09] it's really scary to think about that,
[65:12] but it's also really important because
[65:15] what does it mean if you actually have
[65:16] to flee from your home because of a
[65:19] natural disaster or a political
[65:20] disaster? Like how are you actually
[65:22] going to protect yourself if you find
[65:24] that like you can't go home, you can't
[65:26] go back to your country of origin and
[65:27] that like you're now a refugee
[65:30] somewhere? Like what do you do about
[65:31] money? Do you have access to it? Do you
[65:34] have access to any property? And so I
[65:37] think that's one of the really important
[65:39] things. But if anybody has an
[65:41] opportunity to get my book, uh it's also
[65:43] really important that like you can you
[65:46] can really drill down pretty deep into
[65:47] these issues of like why is Bitcoin
[65:50] important? How does it provide this sort
[65:53] of new political substrate? Uh like what
[65:56] what does even mean that we have access
[65:58] to these tools and technology for the
[66:00] future? Uh, and I think just really
[66:02] trying to think hard about all of the
[66:04] problems in front of us is really
[66:06] important because there's a lot of
[66:08] innovative and thoughtful solutions that
[66:10] can kind of come about just from doing
[66:12] that. That's really good. I love
[66:14] that. Gives me a lot of like the the the
[66:19] possibility of of some disaster makes
[66:22] you aware of how important it is to have
[66:24] something like Bitcoin or even beyond
[66:26] that. But money is so fundamental and so
[66:29] important to to take that first. Really
[66:31] cool. Um, we have an endine in the
[66:33] podcast where the previous guest is
[66:34] asking a question for the next guest
[66:36] without knowing who the next guest
[66:37] actually is and the previous guest asks
[66:39] you uh an interesting one. In in what
[66:44] year did Bitcoin become or will Bitcoin
[66:47] become unstoppable? I think
[66:50] 2014 after like the first of the China
[66:52] bans where China tried to ban Bitcoin
[66:55] mining in China. I think that uh like
[66:58] power to the network dropped off by like
[67:00] 40% or something, but it rebounded
[67:02] pretty quickly after that. And to me
[67:04] that was like a pretty clear signal that
[67:06] uh we had kind of crossed the rubric on
[67:09] that. And so like to me Bitcoin's
[67:12] already at an undefeable place. It's
[67:14] just whether or not people recognize
[67:16] that. Um yeah, and I think like that is
[67:20] part of the ultimate political task of
[67:22] Bitcoin too is really making it clear to
[67:23] people that like it's not going away. it
[67:25] can't be defeated. Uh there's no way for
[67:28] any single nation state to sort of take
[67:31] over Bitcoin and we're witnessing that
[67:34] more and more as we go into the future.
[67:37] And so
[67:38] um yeah, I mean my my own view of all of
[67:41] this has become much more casual is that
[67:43] like I don't I don't feel some strong
[67:46] desperation to get out and convince
[67:48] everybody that like they need to get on
[67:49] Bitcoin. In fact, like I'm pretty jaded
[67:51] about it. Uh I think that people will
[67:54] naturally come to it because of their
[67:56] own needs for it. And I think after you
[67:59] get screwed over enough times, whether
[68:01] it's from, you know, uh you find that
[68:05] your pension has been drained or you
[68:07] find that, you know, because you're on a
[68:10] CBD system, you can't buy something that
[68:12] you want to or you know, your house
[68:14] burns down and you realize it's not the
[68:16] great storage of value you thought it
[68:18] was. I think eventually people will be
[68:19] like, "Huh, like that Bitcoin thing I
[68:21] heard like that addresses its problem
[68:23] and then people will go through their
[68:25] own natural process of understanding
[68:26] it." And as I said earlier, like it's
[68:29] only 16 years old and like all this
[68:32] podcast development stuff has only been
[68:33] in the last seven years. So like what
[68:36] what happens in the next 5 years by the
[68:38] time we get to 2030? What about all the
[68:40] kids that are coming up right now that
[68:42] like their parents are Bitcoiners? you
[68:43] know, like my like I know my children
[68:46] are like pretty uninterested in the idea
[68:48] of like a bank account and traditional
[68:49] savings and so like I think we're just
[68:52] moving into a phase of power where uh
[68:55] like the old system has to die off and
[68:57] also like it's really important that
[68:59] that old system dies off. Like look at
[69:01] the wealth disparity between the boomer
[69:03] class and uh like generation X right
[69:06] now. It's like really really disturbing.
[69:10] Um, and I think like the only way that
[69:13] Gen Xers and below are going to actually
[69:15] protect themselves is with something
[69:17] like Bitcoin and just straight up
[69:19] abandoning the old financial system. And
[69:21] like as that system collapses,
[69:23] governments are going to freak out and
[69:24] be like, "You guys got to participate in
[69:26] the pension system." And hopefully there
[69:27] will actually be political contingencies
[69:30] in parties at this point that'll be
[69:31] like, "No, like you. You guys
[69:33]  this whole thing up. You guys are
[69:36] made it so that the pension system will
[69:38] go to zero." And like that's on
[69:40] you. Nothing to do with us. We have this
[69:43] other savings in this method to protect
[69:45] ourselves. Everybody of our generation
[69:47] owns a little bit of Bitcoin. It's a
[69:49] deflationary system. So that little bit
[69:51] of savings will continue to acrue
[69:53] itself. And like we're not interested in
[69:55] playing with you guys anymore. And I
[69:58] think like that will eventually be a
[70:00] worldwide global revolution where all of
[70:03] the old political systems fail at the
[70:05] same time that the monetary systems
[70:08] collapse and that a new sort of
[70:10] political bloom will come about where
[70:12] people go, "Yeah, we are going to use
[70:14] this decentralized peer-to-peer money
[70:17] because nobody can control it." And
[70:19] that's really important after the last
[70:21] 70 years of being part of these endemic
[70:25] fiat systems that to be very clear are
[70:28] highly abusive. Like these are
[70:30] slavebased systems that want to extract
[70:33] as many resources as possible out of
[70:35] everyone. and we finally reaching the
[70:38] end point where like I mean like I'm
[70:41] sure that in key Austrian cities very
[70:43] similar to how it is in the United
[70:45] States
[70:46] like you can't buy a home in San
[70:49] Francisco unless you're a millionaire
[70:51] and there are very few millionaires you
[70:53] know you can't buy a home in bum
[70:56] nowhere unless you're making more than
[70:58] the average American so like what what
[71:00] are most people going to do and that's
[71:03] explicitly by design of how the fiat
[71:05] monetary system works in the way that it
[71:07] has made it so that the key asset of
[71:10] being able to live your home like is the
[71:14] savings vehicle that is pumped to
[71:16] infinity you know and it's really sad
[71:18] and despotic and abusive and I hope at
[71:22] some point people will go and you don't
[71:24] have to do it anymore you don't have to
[71:26] get on the hamster wheel you don't have
[71:27] to save your money in that's going
[71:29] to inflate to nothing and you have the
[71:31] ability to actually protect yourselves
[71:32] with a storage of value that we can
[71:35] prove to you can't get printed up and
[71:38] that there is no sort of emergency
[71:41] decree that can change how that system
[71:43] functions like it's there and that's
[71:45] reserved for you and you alone.
[71:48] That's that's so beautiful and I I I do
[71:51] hope we come to that future and and I'm
[71:53] I'm very certain about that. Really
[71:55] cool. Thank you so much, Eric, for for
[71:57] being on the podcast. Um before I let
[71:59] you go, where where can people find you,
[72:01] ask your questions, and reach out to
[72:02] you? I have a website,
[72:04] cryptosvereignty.org. or uh I'm still
[72:06] lurking around on Twitter. My handle's
[72:08] just Eric Kasein. Uh but Noster is the
[72:11] place that like I'm usually on. If
[72:12] you're unfamiliar with Noster, you
[72:14] should get on there. It's a
[72:15] decentralized peer-to-peer social
[72:17] network. So like you can't get
[72:19] cancelled. So if you like to say pretty
[72:21] spicy stuff, uh or if you have
[72:23] alternative political views, Nostra is
[72:25] probably a pretty great place for you to
[72:26] be because you can say whatever wacky
[72:28] stuff you want and people can't stop you
[72:30] from saying it. People can definitely
[72:32] stop listening to you. So, I would
[72:34] suggest not being super rude and unkind,
[72:37] but you know, you do you. Yeah. It's
[72:39] like the the free market. You you you
[72:41] put it out there. Uh and uh if if if
[72:44] nobody likes it, uh that that's your
[72:46] feedback from the free market. Exactly.
[72:49] Yeah. So, so go experiment with the free
[72:51] market and see what happens. Really
[72:53] cool. Thank you so much, Eric, for for
[72:55] for being on. Also, thank you so much
[72:56] for everyone that is watching and
[72:58] listening for joining us today. As
[72:59] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[73:01] another episode. Bye-bye.
