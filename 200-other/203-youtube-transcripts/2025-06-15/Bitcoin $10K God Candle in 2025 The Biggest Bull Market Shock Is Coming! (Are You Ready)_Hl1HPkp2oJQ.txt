[00:00] I do think that one day we will have a
[00:02] $10,000 God candle. Meaning that
[00:05] Bitcoin's price measured by dollar will
[00:08] go up $10,000 in a day. 10 years ago,
[00:11] the idea that Bitcoin that one Bitcoin
[00:14] could even be worth 10K, that in itself
[00:17] was uh would get you sent off to
[00:19] therapy. Most people just aren't ready
[00:22] for what's going to hit. And that that
[00:25] is uh they they don't appreciate what a
[00:29] true digitally based supply shock will
[00:32] do to the price. If you're doing any
[00:35] kind of Bitcoin advocacy, that's like a
[00:38] really obvious area of your life where
[00:41] you can just just choose to be as pure
[00:43] as the driven snow. If you can't find a
[00:46] way for Bitcoin to make you happier,
[00:50] then you're doing it wrong.
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] Hi uh DN Mr. Comply, welcome back on the
[01:00] show. Hey gosh, I you know this is the
[01:04] first uh podcast I haven't been invited
[01:07] back. No, that's not true. I've been
[01:09] invited back to Pleb Underground, but I
[01:12] was just uh really honored that you
[01:16] thought to have me back on and uh I I
[01:20] regard your podcast as just phenomenal
[01:22] and uh the fact that you wanted me back
[01:24] as a guest was really made my week. So
[01:27] happy to be here. Awesome. Thank you so
[01:29] much. That that that is really nice to
[01:31] hear. Well, I I am just thrilled to be
[01:34] uh back and I have a lot of stuff top of
[01:37] mind uh right now. Uh you know, I
[01:40] haven't um I mean, I'm always paying
[01:43] attention to Bitcoin. I'm probably
[01:44] giving it an hour or two most days. It's
[01:47] not my career, but it's something I'm
[01:49] passionate about and I'm pretty heavily
[01:52] invested in it. Uh, so I'm always paying
[01:54] attention to Bitcoin, but um your
[01:57] invitation and knowing that this show
[01:59] was coming up uh forced me to actually
[02:03] uh I I probably uh I I just finished
[02:07] spending a couple three hours of pretty
[02:11] intense work this morning. Uh, and uh,
[02:15] so I decided that wait, hey, what better
[02:18] way than to prepare for your podcast
[02:22] than to dive back into my Bitcoin basics
[02:26] essay for the first time in a couple of
[02:28] years and read the thing through from
[02:31] start to finish and to update everything
[02:34] that needed updating. So, I updated uh,
[02:38] three different uh, figures. I added
[02:41] some links. I updated the uh um gold
[02:45] versus Bitcoin price and cleaned up some
[02:48] of the uh English a little more. Um so I
[02:51] just I just finished uh literally 20
[02:54] minutes ago um like a a pretty hardcore
[02:58] threehour editing session to uh to
[03:02] basically make my my essay current as of
[03:06] today. And that would not have happened
[03:09] had you not given me the impetus to uh I
[03:13] guess get on my ass and start working.
[03:15] Usually you say get off your ass and
[03:17] start working, but when you're a writer,
[03:18] you actually have to get on your ass or
[03:21] as Richard Rhodess beautifully puts it,
[03:24] apply ass to chair. So yeah, it's it's
[03:29] like if you're working in front of a
[03:31] computer or like writing something down,
[03:32] you're like you're all constantly on
[03:34] your ass, but you're working your ass
[03:35] off. Yes. Yeah. you're yes it's it's a
[03:38] conundrum it's but but yes both things
[03:42] are simultaneously true but uh the
[03:45] important thing is that I am uh doubly
[03:48] caffeinated versus my normal day of work
[03:52] uh because I needed to do all this uh
[03:54] editing and now I'm here with you so I'm
[03:57] just raring to go really really cool um
[04:01] and your your asset is really cool and
[04:03] maybe we we can touch on that because a
[04:05] lot of people probably haven't seen the
[04:07] first uh episode as as the podcast grew
[04:09] quite a lot. Um what the asset is about
[04:12] and maybe also how uh your view on on
[04:15] Bitcoin may maybe has changed and what
[04:17] what kind of your update thoughts on on
[04:20] that are. Yeah, I don't know how much my
[04:24] view on Bitcoin has changed because uh
[04:29] you know whatever I may have going for
[04:31] me as a Bitcoin pleb who's kind of
[04:33] outspoken uh my technical grasp is is
[04:37] not impressive. I mean, you know, um,
[04:42] but I think I think lacking an advanced
[04:45] technical grasp often makes you more
[04:49] firmly in command of the basics, which
[04:52] is, hey, you know, one Bitcoin always
[04:54] equals one Bitcoin. And all you need to
[04:58] do is pay some attention to the greater
[05:00] macroeconomics picture uh about how the
[05:04] world's economies are heading into an
[05:07] abyss involving money printing leading
[05:10] to hyperinflation. So I mean you know my
[05:13] convictions have only deepened about the
[05:16] greater economic picture and where
[05:18] Bitcoin fits into it. But I don't think
[05:21] that my um
[05:24] technical understanding of Bitcoin has
[05:27] grown by leaps and bounds since the last
[05:29] time you had me on. Actually um you know
[05:33] one one thing happening in my life is
[05:36] that I have spent the last seven years
[05:39] or so traveling and I've been to about
[05:43] 40 countries over the last seven years
[05:46] and uh I'm tired of it. I'm tired of all
[05:49] this travel. Uh I mean it's been
[05:51] fantastic, but uh I finally reached the
[05:54] point where uh in a few weeks I'm going
[05:57] to jet off to Europe and go go to a few
[06:00] more places and then I'm going to settle
[06:02] down for at least a couple of years. And
[06:07] at that point I want to uh you know
[06:11] probably pick up like a start 9 solution
[06:15] uh or umbrell or or something along
[06:17] those lines and um you know spin up my
[06:22] own node and uh sort of uh dial
[06:28] in more technical abilities so that I
[06:31] can be uh oh what's the term they use
[06:34] like you know like a Well, you know, not
[06:38] just a Bitcoiner, but but like a true
[06:42] first class sovereign Bitcoiner. Uh, and
[06:45] uh that to do that I I need, as George
[06:50] Carlin puts it, a place for my stuff. I
[06:52] need my own bed. I need my own desk. And
[06:56] I can't just be, you know, going living
[06:58] this itinerate life going from coffee
[07:01] shop to coffee shop. So, I I'm really
[07:04] looking forward to having that. And um
[07:07] you know assuming I get a third
[07:10] invitation on your podcast six or nine
[07:13] months hence uh I may be able to bring a
[07:17] lot more to the party talking about my
[07:21] uh the progression of my technical
[07:23] aptitude because I feel like that's
[07:25] lacking and you know I I am thinking
[07:29] about like you know because I do have a
[07:33] background as a technical writer and
[07:37] somebody who kind of specializes in
[07:39] writing introductory materials. I think
[07:42] that
[07:43] um once I learn sort of the finer points
[07:48] of
[07:49] self-custody and and I have my own setup
[07:53] using the very latest uh technologies
[07:56] and software, I might be exceedingly
[08:00] well positioned to explain it to less
[08:04] technical people. I mean, you know, Ben
[08:06] Perin does a terrific job of that
[08:09] already, but uh I think that the the
[08:14] appetite and the necessity for
[08:18] entrylevel technical writing surrounding
[08:21] Bitcoin is uh likely to um go through
[08:26] the roof as we approach the event
[08:28] horizon of hyper bitcoinization.
[08:32] That's very true because uh a lot of the
[08:34] content is now focused on why bitcoin
[08:39] and uh once more and more people get it
[08:42] the content for how actually we are
[08:44] doing those bitcoin stuff like the
[08:46] technical aspect of self custody running
[08:49] your own full node everything like that
[08:52] um that was PDC sessions Ben Baron is is
[08:55] doing uh gets more and more interesting
[08:58] and I had pen on my show and and he's is
[09:00] an incredible by um and he says he
[09:02] really wants to focus on the how. Uh and
[09:06] a lot of people are focused on on the
[09:08] why like sailor like the like pe big
[09:11] people like that they're all like uh
[09:12] telling you why to buy Bitcoin and why
[09:15] it's a good idea. Um but then uh the how
[09:19] people are less just because it's a
[09:21] smaller market. Uh so but it will uh get
[09:24] increasingly more important. Yeah. Yeah.
[09:27] And and honestly, I mean, I don't think
[09:31] that I am at all gifted when it comes to
[09:37] my ability to
[09:40] uh my technical aptitude and learning
[09:42] kind of uh lower level technologies. Uh,
[09:46] and for somebody like me who's who seems
[09:50] to be crossing a border every month with
[09:52] my MacBook, uh, I don't even want to be
[09:56] running my own node or bringing my
[09:59] private keys with me. And, uh, you know,
[10:02] in any event, you know, my my brain is
[10:06] not sufficiently functional for me to
[10:08] even possess a brain wallet when it
[10:10] comes to crossing borders. So, you know,
[10:13] you I I think I think, you know, I I've
[10:16] never said this before. Uh and I guess
[10:19] there's, you know, if you ask a hundred
[10:21] people what the first rule of Bitcoin
[10:23] ought to be, you'll get a hundred
[10:25] different answers. But, uh, you know,
[10:28] maybe maybe I would say uh the first
[10:32] rule of Bitcoin is understand your
[10:34] limitations. You know, I think there are
[10:37] I think there are people in the Bitcoin
[10:39] community who are relatively
[10:41] sophisticated at it who who actually in
[10:44] their heart of hearts believe that
[10:46] grandma can run her own private note.
[10:49] And you know, it's like, dude, that's
[10:52] delusional. Grandma thinks that Facebook
[10:55] is the internet. You know, she is not
[10:57] ever going to run her private node or do
[11:00] a check sum of the things that she's
[11:02] just downloaded. Are you out of your
[11:04] mind? But um you know I think I think
[11:07] when it comes to knowing your
[11:09] limitations, some people are just so
[11:12] technically off the charts and skilled
[11:15] that they don't realize that their main
[11:17] limitation is is is not knowing that
[11:20] there is just this enormous chasm
[11:23] between them and the rest of society.
[11:27] And um you know I I think maybe that
[11:30] that's
[11:31] um that's something that I try to bring
[11:34] to the table is that uh you know my
[11:38] Bitcoin basics essay is not meant for
[11:41] Lyn Alden or Matt Odell. It's meant for
[11:44] normal people who have uh who are just
[11:47] edging into the world of Bitcoin and uh
[11:52] and and uh don't yet know 1% of
[11:56] everything they need to know to start
[11:58] making informed choices. That that's
[12:00] very true. I I already looking forward
[12:02] to the end routine of the podcast
[12:04] because the question for the end routine
[12:05] today fits perfectly to that. But I will
[12:08] try to to get keep it off for end
[12:10] routine. And uh maybe a little bit uh
[12:14] back to to where I'm I'm trying to do
[12:16] with with repeating guests because uh
[12:19] our view on Bitcoin mostly stays the
[12:21] same once we have done uh the the
[12:23] research on Bitcoin itself. The the
[12:25] whole premise around it is that it does
[12:27] not change every month like some other
[12:30] protocols or anything like that. So, but
[12:33] what is actually changing a lot is the
[12:35] world around Bitcoin and how people
[12:37] interact with Bitcoin and how many more
[12:39] people interact with Bitcoin. What was
[12:42] kind of standing out for you since the
[12:44] last let's say one year where you have
[12:46] been on uh in in the Bitcoin world?
[12:49] Well, I you know I have only ever made
[12:55] one
[12:57] prediction regarding Bitcoin and and
[13:00] that is that I think that there is
[13:03] absolutely positively going to be a
[13:06] supply shock and that supply shock will
[13:09] be
[13:10] fundamentally of a different
[13:14] magnitude than any sort of supply shock
[13:17] that happens in the physical physical
[13:19] world because Bitcoin has the absolute
[13:23] cap of 21 million. You know, if we're
[13:25] going to have an oil supply shock,
[13:28] different nations have the incentive to
[13:30] cheat or to drill. And so the supply cap
[13:35] is is anything but hard. Uh same thing
[13:38] with gold, same thing with any other
[13:40] physical commodity. But with with
[13:43] Bitcoin, uh, you have this absolute
[13:48] unforgiving virtual nature of there will
[13:51] only ever be 21 million coins and all of
[13:54] them are verified anytime you move a
[13:57] coin. So like an absolute hardcore cap
[14:01] on the supply exists within Bitcoin. And
[14:05] my contention has always been that hey I
[14:09] can't tell you when it's going to happen
[14:12] but we are getting closer every month to
[14:16] having a supply shock and I you know I
[14:19] think when that happens you get the
[14:21] Samson Mau god candles you know I I do I
[14:26] do believe well first of all you should
[14:28] never measure Bitcoin by dollars but I
[14:31] guess we all kind of fall into that hole
[14:33] and so I'll fall into that hole uh
[14:36] knowingly right now. I do think that one
[14:38] day we will have a $10,000 God candle
[14:42] and uh meaning that Bitcoin's price
[14:45] measured by dollar will go up by $10,000
[14:49] in a day. And I I would bet a large sum
[14:52] of money that that will happen in the
[14:54] next 10 years. Um will it happen next
[14:57] month or next year? I don't know. But I
[15:00] I
[15:01] am I've always believed that a supply
[15:04] shock was going to happen and it just uh
[15:07] feels like it's uh it it's coming a lot
[15:11] closer now even though I can't uh I
[15:14] can't tell you the date and I think that
[15:17] people are unprepared
[15:21] uh because even though we've seen you
[15:24] know this massive runup in Bitcoin over
[15:27] the last 1015 years. Even though it's uh
[15:30] it's up something like 200 times since I
[15:33] bought my first Bitcoin, I think u I
[15:37] think we're we have never
[15:40] seen a true supply shock with Bitcoin
[15:43] and I believe that one is coming. And
[15:45] and why do I believe that? Well, you
[15:47] know, just uh yesterday, New Hampshire
[15:51] uh approved a uh a crypto reserve. Now,
[15:55] it drives me crazy that it's a crypto
[15:57] reserve and not a Bitcoin reserve, but
[15:59] you know, most of it's going to be
[16:00] Bitcoin, where one would hope since, you
[16:03] know, New Hampshire is historically a
[16:06] pretty smart uh part of the United
[16:08] States. Um, but um there are more states
[16:12] on the way. And then you look at what
[16:15] Michael Sailor at Micro Strategy is
[16:17] doing. Uh I mean at this point he has
[16:22] captured
[16:23] uh
[16:25] 555,000 Bitcoin. Now you have uh now now
[16:30] you have Jack Mer's 21 company getting
[16:33] in with its own massive uh purchasing.
[16:37] Like to me it's only a matter of time
[16:39] since uh until u the last of the
[16:43] milkshake is suddenly and abruptly
[16:46] sucked up and there's just no more
[16:49] thousands of easily cheaply purchased
[16:52] coins laying around. And I think when
[16:54] that moment hits, it is going to be as
[16:57] abrupt as somebody drinking a milkshake
[17:00] out of a out of an opaque uh glass and
[17:04] all of a sudden they go from thinking
[17:06] they have plenty of milkshake to
[17:08] realizing it's all gone.
[17:11] It's it's the moment when you have a
[17:13] really nice drink and you're drinking
[17:15] and all of the sudden there's nothing
[17:17] coming out anymore and you're like, "Oh
[17:18]  oh Oh shit." It's like I I I
[17:20] know I know that a lot. I I just want to
[17:22] um your prediction is already true with
[17:24] the uh God candle apparently. I was
[17:27] curious because I thought I heard
[17:29] something and uh actually I was not sure
[17:34] if if if I just imagined that but
[17:36] apparently we had on February 3rd uh
[17:40] already our first God candle. Um, uh,
[17:44] Pier Rashad, uh, also apparently posted
[17:47] it on February 3rd, uh, within a single
[17:50] 24-hour period. I think previously it
[17:52] was like the the biggest one was like, I
[17:54] don't know, 7,000 or something like
[17:56] that. Uh, but but we have many more
[17:59] candles to go as the Bitcoin fair based
[18:02] like uh the divine candle 50K and oh,
[18:06] now we're switching to to Twitter or the
[18:08] Omega candle and the Alford Sentry. I I
[18:11] didn't knew about those those namings.
[18:13] Yeah. Well, I I mean I'm I'm You're
[18:15] sharing your screen and I'm looking at
[18:17] it and
[18:19] and I just got to say that that God
[18:21] candle is kind of cheating a little
[18:23] because it's mostly wick and very little
[18:26] candle. There wasn't a whole lot of
[18:28] change from day to day. When I think of
[18:30] God candle, I'm not thinking about wick.
[18:32] I'm thinking about like one day Bitcoin
[18:35] is 120 grand and the next day it's 130
[18:39] grand. like just just a a big
[18:43] $10,000 overall increase from one day to
[18:46] the next and no no cheating by talking
[18:49] about downtrends and uptrends that
[18:52] aren't lasting. But um I don't know. I
[18:56] mean I if if they want to call that a
[18:59] god
[19:01] candle, okay, fine. But I I one day
[19:05] we'll see a real god candle that's
[19:07] actually candle and not wick. Yeah. Uh
[19:11] this is uh bit Bitcoiners really like to
[19:14] to celebrate uh whenever the the first
[19:19] instance is like the as long as it's
[19:21] like if there's like a little bit
[19:23] evidence of something actually broke. Uh
[19:25] people want to be the first to report
[19:27] it. It's it's the nature of social media
[19:29] and yeah, you're right. So like really
[19:32] God candles for me 10ks is like even if
[19:34] it's sustainable for me like God candles
[19:38] seems to be something bigger like I
[19:40] don't know like 10k seems to be almost
[19:42] small to do that but like when we reach
[19:44] out those levels. Yeah. Yeah. And you
[19:47] know, I mean, that's the thing though,
[19:49] like 10 years ago, the idea that
[19:52] Bitcoin, that one Bitcoin could even be
[19:54] worth 10K, that in itself was uh would
[19:58] get you sent off to therapy. Um, you
[20:01] know, I I like when I bought
[20:04] Bitcoin, it seemed really sensible to me
[20:07] that one Bitcoin could be worth well
[20:10] over the price of an ounce of gold. And
[20:14] uh so like your definitions keep
[20:16] stretching to accommodate uh where
[20:18] Bitcoin is going. But I I think when the
[20:21] when the true supply shock hits, you'll
[20:23] see repeated God candles. You'll see up
[20:27] $10,000 today, up $15,000 tomorrow. I
[20:31] think that
[20:33] um I mean, and that's the only
[20:35] prediction I really have concerning
[20:37] Bitcoin. It's that most people just
[20:40] aren't ready for what's going to hit.
[20:43] And that that is uh they they don't
[20:45] appreciate what a true digitally based
[20:50] supply shock will do to the price. I and
[20:54] the effect that it will have will be
[20:56] just so much greater than a than a
[20:58] gasoline crisis or or a silver frenzy.
[21:03] you know, it's just going to be a a a
[21:05] different level of uh order of magnitude
[21:08] uh when you've got a truly scarce finite
[21:12] digital asset versus something that can
[21:15] be mined and uh given a more elastic
[21:19] supply. Yeah. And we never had this like
[21:22] we we're always trying to figure out
[21:24] what Bitcoin will actually do. And yes,
[21:26] of course, we can look at past
[21:28] inventions, we can look at past uh
[21:31] events. Uh but we never had a global
[21:35] digital scarce asset that 8 billion
[21:38] people have a reason to buy.
[21:42] Yeah. And you know I I
[21:45] travel far more than most people. And I
[21:50] mean so why did why did I write this
[21:52] essay? I wrote it
[21:55] because I I you know I haven't made a
[21:58] dime for that essay. I there's no
[22:00] advertising on it. I pay my own hosting
[22:03] fees. Like that essay was as pure of a
[22:06] gift that I can give because it was just
[22:10] uh all all cost and nothing received in
[22:13] return. And and I fundamentally wanted
[22:17] uh my Bitcoin basics essay to be like my
[22:21] my gift to the uh Bitcoin universe. And
[22:25] I wrote it because uh as I travel around
[22:29] the world, it doesn't mean it doesn't
[22:31] matter if it's uh you know the the the
[22:35] the 21-year-old girl in uh in uh Vietnam
[22:41] making me coffee or the uh 50, you know,
[22:46] the 60-year-old Japanese couple at the
[22:49] uh at at the coffee shop I go to who
[22:52] grind the coffee like or or the guy who
[22:56] works up the street from them who owns
[22:59] the local bakery. Like none of these
[23:02] people own Bitcoin. None of them. It
[23:06] doesn't matter what country I go to,
[23:08] like the percentage of people who who I
[23:12] encounter who actually own some Bitcoin,
[23:16] it's it's still it's still well under
[23:20] 1%. And I gotta tell you, Robin, that
[23:23] that is heartbreaking to me. Like I I uh
[23:27] I mean, one of the things I feel best
[23:30] about in my entire life is that
[23:34] virtually every single person who is a
[23:38] real friend of mine, every real person
[23:41] in my life who I love, I have orange
[23:45] pill. They with only I think one
[23:48] exception. Uh
[23:51] they uh they all own some Bitcoin. In
[23:54] fact, in most cases, they I I have many
[23:59] friends who own more than 10 Bitcoin
[24:02] because each because of me and uh you
[24:07] know many more friends who have lifech
[24:09] changing amounts of wealth because they
[24:13] listened to me five or 10 years ago and
[24:15] I made it my mission to just keep
[24:18] irritating them and pestering them until
[24:20] they finally broke down and bought some
[24:22] because I could see where this was
[24:24] headed. And um you know I I do make a
[24:28] point like it makes me so happy to know
[24:31] that um the uh the guy in southern Japan
[24:36] who runs the bakery uh that I that I
[24:40] like to go to, he you know I turned him
[24:43] on to Bitcoin and he bought some and I
[24:46] he didn't buy a lot but it was a lot to
[24:48] him and he owns well over one person's
[24:53] worth of the world's Bitcoin, which as
[24:56] you probably know, Robin, is
[25:00] 0.0027 Bitcoin. That's one person's
[25:03] worth of Bitcoin. And he owns multiples
[25:06] of that. And he's watched it triple over
[25:09] the last year since he's bought it. And
[25:12] that feels that feels really good to me.
[25:16] Um, you know, I
[25:18] uh I think that, you know,
[25:23] nonobnoxiously advocating for Bitcoin
[25:27] and being kind
[25:29] of, you know, an evangelist in the
[25:32] non-spiritual sense of the term,
[25:35] somebody who's just super well-informed
[25:38] yet not fundamentalist or dogmatic and
[25:41] who can win people over. It's it's one
[25:44] of the kindest things you can do. Like
[25:48] it just feels really good. Like may
[25:52] maybe there aren't too many people who
[25:53] can say this and I I don't you know I I
[25:57] I don't want to sound like I'm patting
[25:59] myself on the back, but I know that I
[26:02] know that there's at least a dozen
[26:04] people who I am friends with and know of
[26:08] who own appreciable amounts of Bitcoin
[26:11] because of me. And I have no idea how
[26:14] many people of the several thousand who
[26:16] read my essay went on to buy some coins
[26:19] as a result of what I did. But
[26:22] um you know it's like one of the things
[26:25] I'm going to feel best about in my life
[26:28] when I'm on my deathbed is that I orange
[26:31] pilledled a whole bunch of people and
[26:32] got their and and got them to have you
[26:37] know lifech changing amounts of uh
[26:41] wealth. I mean that that's just a really
[26:44] that's a real blessing to give to other
[26:47] people. uh and and I have I feel so much
[26:52] satisfaction that I have been able to do
[26:56] that for uh for the people I care most
[27:00] about. Uh, and
[27:03] um, you know, I I hope that now the
[27:06] trouble of Bitcoin is that as as you
[27:09] know better than nearly anyone, there's
[27:13] just so much to it. And to understand
[27:16] Bitcoin, you you really need a
[27:19] rudimentary understanding of
[27:21] macroeconomics. You need a an
[27:23] understanding of how currency is created
[27:25] and what fiat currency actually is. You
[27:29] need to have some technical aptitude and
[27:33] some understanding of cryptography and
[27:36] how that works and and how that can be
[27:38] married with a script that uh that
[27:43] that you know that basically the script
[27:46] that underlies the the Bitcoin network
[27:50] and uh you know
[27:52] peer-to-peer uh uh sharing of a
[27:55] distributed ledger. I mean, this very
[27:57] quickly goes off the rails to something
[27:59] you need to be a CS major to really
[28:01] understand, but uh like you need a
[28:04] highlevel understanding of so many
[28:08] uh discrete things. And one of the
[28:12] things I've noticed with Bitcoin is that
[28:14] I have uh a few friends who are pretty
[28:20] uh established as hardcore scientists. I
[28:24] can, you know, I can think of two
[28:26] different friends of mine who are
[28:28] actually uh science professors at
[28:31] universities. And you would think that
[28:34] people with that degree of intellect and
[28:36] that degree of uh of of going down into
[28:40] the weeds would be the first people to
[28:44] uh really get a a real grasp of Bitcoin
[28:47] and that they'd be much better
[28:49] positioned than uh than than your
[28:52] average duck to learn about Bitcoin. But
[28:56] the reality is that those people are
[28:58] actually the the it seems like it seems
[29:02] like those very skills um have have made
[29:06] them so hyper critical that they
[29:10] overthink everything and can't uh and
[29:13] and can't really get the big picture.
[29:16] So, it's it's it's funny how that works,
[29:19] but
[29:20] um you know, I I think that some of the
[29:24] smartest and best educated people I've
[29:26] encountered are actually the hardest
[29:29] people to orange pill and and that all
[29:32] of their intellect kind of works at
[29:34] cross purposes with them just breaking
[29:37] down and and uh and and you know, just
[29:41] just saying, "Okay, maybe I'm wrong, but
[29:44] I'll I'll put 1% of my wealth into
[29:46] Bitcoin. It's it's so it's it's funny
[29:50] how that works. But u I guess just to
[29:53] tie up this this rambling
[29:57] uh uh this this rant with in into a bow,
[30:02] uh I I really want to encourage people
[30:06] to realize that you can accomplish a lot
[30:09] by by just making an effort to orange
[30:11] people. And if you haven't read my
[30:15] essay, I hope you will because even if
[30:18] you're pretty far along in terms of uh
[30:22] understanding Bitcoin, uh you might
[30:24] decide that this is the best single
[30:26] thing to recommend to newbies to begin
[30:30] connecting the dots. U and
[30:34] uh you know, everybody has to start
[30:37] somewhere. I say in my essay that you
[30:39] need a 100 hours to really uh grock
[30:43] Bitcoin in in kind of a a coherent way,
[30:46] but you got to start somewhere. And my
[30:48] essay intends to be the the place where
[30:50] you learn where you spend your very
[30:52] first hour and get your basic
[30:54] orientation.
[30:56] And for everyone uh wondering where they
[30:59] can find that article, I always uh link
[31:03] the Twitter of of my guests in in the
[31:06] link down in the description. And I
[31:09] think if I remember correctly in your
[31:11] Twitter bio, you have a link to that
[31:14] very article, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's
[31:16] just the DN as in do not
[31:20] dnly.com. You just go to that website
[31:22] and uh the essay is right there. really
[31:25] proud to say I don't have Google
[31:27] Analytics on the site. I don't have any
[31:29] advertising. I don't have any links to
[31:33] shitcoins or any of that. I've just
[31:37] um this is certainly one area of my I I
[31:41] aspire to live a life without
[31:43] compromising. And one of the nice things
[31:46] about Bitcoin anyway is
[31:48] that if you're doing any kind of Bitcoin
[31:52] advocacy, that's like a really obvious
[31:56] area of your life where you can just uh
[31:59] just choose to be as pure as the driven
[32:01] snow. And uh hopefully from that
[32:04] foothold, you can branch out into other
[32:07] areas of your life and just continue to
[32:09] up your uh integrity. And um so I I if
[32:15] if there is a way to make to publish my
[32:21] essay with with a greater level of uh
[32:25] purity. Uh I don't know it. I've I've
[32:29] done everything I could could to just
[32:32] put this online in a way that there's
[32:34] just no compromises, no ethical
[32:37] compromises at all. Let's take a break
[32:39] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[32:42] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[32:45] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[32:48] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[32:51] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[32:54] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[32:56] completely new and amazing Genesis
[32:59] edition of their watch collections. You
[33:02] have the date of the first ever mined
[33:05] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[33:07] also the block height and which epoch we
[33:10] are currently in. I love the level of
[33:13] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[33:16] Make sure to check out those amazing
[33:18] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[33:21] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[33:24] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[33:27] really do hope that you don't have it on
[33:29] exchange. But if you do have it on
[33:31] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[33:33] deal with that. The first way is you put
[33:35] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[33:37] entry for you to get into the
[33:40] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[33:43] Bitcoin only edition. For that, it's a
[33:46] super simple and secure way. And if you
[33:49] check out the link in the description,
[33:51] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[33:54] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[33:57] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[34:00] partner in terms of how to get the most
[34:03] out of your sovereignty. They will
[34:05] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[34:08] that is perfect for your individual
[34:11] situation. They will show you how you
[34:13] can secure your own devices. Securing
[34:16] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[34:18] have to keep all your devices secure.
[34:21] One topic that is overlooked often is
[34:23] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[34:26] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[34:29] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[34:31] place already? And last but not least,
[34:33] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[34:35] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[34:38] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[34:43] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[34:46] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[34:48] be for the first time ever speaking at
[34:51] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[34:54] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[34:56] really looking forward to seeing all of
[34:58] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:01] the link down in the description of
[35:03] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[35:05] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[35:09] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[35:11] there. I I really admire that on you
[35:13] because like uh we haven't talked about
[35:15] it but people obviously know you are
[35:17] here anonymous. Uh so so you also don't
[35:22] take any personal credit. Uh so so you
[35:25] don't take money and and you also don't
[35:28] take uh personal credit. I think we
[35:30] touched on it the first time directly
[35:32] with like why it's important to be
[35:35] private or like why people choose to to
[35:37] to stay private and not be outspoken. uh
[35:40] and it's it's really admirable. Oh,
[35:42] thank you. Thank you. I I think I think
[35:44] that like everybody needs to be the
[35:48] focus of attention for at least some
[35:50] portion of their life. And you if you
[35:52] don't get
[35:53] that small but significant amount of
[35:56] attention at some point in your life,
[35:57] you're always going to feel kind of left
[35:59] out. And I think that's actually one
[36:02] reason that the wedding industry
[36:05] exists, which I regard as
[36:08] like it just makes me sad. But um you
[36:11] know, I think there's people who just
[36:13] never get to be the focus of attention.
[36:16] And so they make they spend tens of
[36:18] thousands of dollars on this one day
[36:21] where they godamn it are going to be the
[36:23] focus of attention for this one
[36:26] miserable day. and and and uh and that's
[36:30] that's their big thing like for the one
[36:33] day they get to be Cinderella or
[36:35] whatever and uh you know
[36:40] I it just makes me sad because it's it's
[36:44] like you know you're the the the
[36:47] attention you receive in in life
[36:51] hopefully should be a result of having
[36:54] done something meaningful uh And uh
[36:58] obviously your choice of getting married
[37:01] is and who you marry that's a meaningful
[37:04] thing but I would hope that like uh at
[37:08] some point you could get your
[37:10] recommended lifetime allowance of
[37:14] recognition in uh through means that
[37:17] have nothing to do with uh who you marry
[37:21] and and that can't be bought. And um you
[37:25] know I'm I'm I'm not uh Tom Cruz or Tom
[37:30] Wait or any of that you know uh but I I
[37:34] I have
[37:36] received you
[37:38] know what next to them is a tiny amount
[37:42] of recognition but it's uh for things
[37:44] I've done in my p you know in my
[37:47] professional life and that's that's
[37:50] enough for a lifetime. So I I decided
[37:54] that uh uh you know I don't need to have
[37:58] any personal recognition for the
[38:00] contributions that I've made with
[38:02] Bitcoin. People have given me plenty of
[38:04] pats on my back uh during my life for
[38:07] all sorts of things and I don't need
[38:10] anymore. You you get the you get the
[38:12] point, you know, you can only drink so
[38:14] much water. You you really only need so
[38:16] much recognition. And so when it comes
[38:19] to Bitcoin, I've just decided to bypass
[38:22] recognition. And it feels really good.
[38:24] It feels really pure to just put
[38:27] something out into the world and not
[38:30] care at all about
[38:34] uh how many people recognize you. I
[38:37] mean, I do care. Uh, and one reason that
[38:40] I'm making time for this podcast, apart
[38:43] from the fact that I genuinely admire
[38:45] you and enjoy talking to you, Robin, is
[38:48] that
[38:49] um is that I I am hoping that another
[38:53] thousand people read my essay and pass
[38:55] it along and all that, but uh you know,
[38:58] as as far as as far as getting
[39:01] additional recognition, well, that
[39:04] that's not part of the game. And in
[39:06] fact, you know, it's it's done under a
[39:08] pseudonym which makes it even more pure.
[39:11] You know, if if DN comply gets a few
[39:14] more links or a few more Twitter
[39:16] follows, well, good. But, you know,
[39:19] nobody who knows me is going to know
[39:21] that. And I don't that's not that's not
[39:23] what drives me. And I I don't know. I
[39:26] think that, you know, obviously my gift
[39:29] to the Bitcoin world is is minuscule
[39:34] compared to others and especially
[39:36] Satoshi who's the embodiment of
[39:39] selflessly and and and sud
[39:42] pseudonominously
[39:44] uh giving a gift to the world. But I
[39:47] think we can all aspire to uh do some
[39:51] stuff without any payback, any
[39:55] recognition.
[39:57] And you know, I've done plenty of things
[39:59] in life for which I've gotten monetary
[40:03] and uh and
[40:05] recognition rewards, but it feels even
[40:08] better to do something knowing your
[40:09] intentions and motivation are absolutely
[40:12] pure. And uh it feels even better. I
[40:16] love that. Yeah. Have you thought about
[40:19] uh like writing something longer than
[40:21] than an article, your theory in like a
[40:23] book or something? Uh I think I think
[40:25] the next thing I do is uh is going to be
[40:29] some uh
[40:32] technically based introductions to
[40:37] self-custody and Bitcoin. Uh probably
[40:41] even more entrylevel than Ben's stuff.
[40:45] Uh because I think that I if if if I'm
[40:48] right and there is a supply shock
[40:51] incoming like having the most
[40:55] rudimentary
[40:57] uh introductions to people who are just
[41:02] as non-technical as you can get is going
[41:06] to be of profound importance. So um I
[41:10] think that's what's coming next for me.
[41:12] I mean, I I do
[41:15] um I I mean, earlier this year, I I
[41:18] wrote uh I wrote about 30,000 words in a
[41:23] few months. It was just kind of daily
[41:25] writing, but that was that was just
[41:27] under my it was semi under my real name,
[41:30] so I'm reluctant to give that out, but
[41:32] it was just like every morning I would
[41:34] get up and write a thousand words and
[41:36] and publish it on WordPress. And I think
[41:39] a hand, you know, some of my friends
[41:41] knew it was from me, but I'm always
[41:43] going to be uh like
[41:46] uh you know, I mean, if you reach a
[41:49] certain point at being a musician,
[41:52] you're probably going to do music every
[41:55] day, every week, just because that's
[41:57] part of what you're best at and what you
[42:00] do. For me, it's writing. I'm that's
[42:02] kind of what I'm best at. I'm I'm always
[42:04] going to be finding something to write
[42:06] about and I happily go weeks at a time
[42:10] without writing and then then I'll
[42:12] immerse myself into it and it's just
[42:15] having a balance. But uh but yeah, I
[42:18] mean uh assuming assuming I've got a few
[42:22] more decades ahead of me, you know, it's
[42:24] it's really unthinkable that I'm not
[42:27] going to be writing hundreds of
[42:29] thousands of more words in that time. Uh
[42:32] I don't know what they're going to be,
[42:34] but uh I I you know, if I'm right that a
[42:37] supply shock is is uh coming, um there's
[42:42] really nothing more important I can do
[42:45] than to provide introductory material
[42:49] because I mean I mean you you
[42:52] undoubtedly know that story about the
[42:54] guy whose uh girlfriend threw away his
[42:58] his hard drive with a billion dollars
[43:00] worth of Bitcoin on it and it's sitting
[43:03] in a in a garbage dump somewhere and um
[43:08] you know that is something where like
[43:11] rudimentary
[43:13] education that's something it could have
[43:16] prevented. I mean, I guess the thing is
[43:18] like there's no doubt in my mind that I
[43:22] have enabled
[43:25] uh people and including many people I
[43:28] care about to collectively buy well over
[43:31] a 100red Bitcoin, you know. So, that's
[43:34] that's a nice contribution to the world.
[43:36] Maybe maybe I've enabled people to buy a
[43:39] thousand Bitcoin. I don't know. But I I
[43:41] think it's into the hundreds of Bitcoin
[43:43] that I've en enabled and encouraged the
[43:45] purchase of. So maybe what I do in my
[43:48] second act is that I enable people to
[43:54] avoid losing several dozen Bitcoin. Uh
[43:58] because I think that's going to be a big
[44:00] thing. I mean, you know, we've got, you
[44:02] know, we we we have ide ideologically
[44:05] pure people within the Bitcoin community
[44:08] who kind of look down their nose at the
[44:11] ETFs and and uh view that maybe even as
[44:16] an an attack on Bitcoin. But I think
[44:18] that's kind of fundamentalism. The
[44:20] reality is that, you know, grandma is
[44:24] not going to be keeping her private keys
[44:26] and validating it on her against her
[44:28] node. you know, that's just not going to
[44:30] happen. And uh if you want in
[44:34] inclusiveness within the the Bitcoin
[44:36] world, uh yeah, encourage encourage self
[44:40] custody for the people who can really
[44:42] and truly do it. But if you have, you
[44:46] know, talked somebody in to a level of
[44:51] custody that they're not
[44:53] actually competent for and then they
[44:56] lose their keys or or get get hacked or
[45:01] whatever, I think that's on you, you
[45:04] know, and so I think there's there's
[45:05] some responsibility that comes with
[45:08] being a Bitcoin advocate and not rushing
[45:12] people along to take on responsibilities
[45:15] that they're poorly equipped or or even
[45:19] outright incapable of adopting
[45:22] to. That that's very true. Yeah. like
[45:25] not not only getting people like the
[45:28] first step is obviously like like if
[45:30] there's a flood coming you want to get
[45:33] the people on the
[45:34] boat and that's the first step but then
[45:37] you also have to um make them learn how
[45:40] to swim make them learn how how to deal
[45:42] with the boat and like make make them
[45:44] learn how to to deal with it so they're
[45:46] not only on the boat but they also don't
[45:48] fall off and they can deal with with
[45:51] with the water if that analogy makes
[45:53] makes sense.
[45:54] So, I I admired it a lot. Well, you
[45:57] know, it's funny because yes, there is a
[45:59] flood coming financially. And what's
[46:03] unique about Bitcoin is that you get to
[46:07] decide whether you're going to get your
[46:12] buy yourself a life buoy or a small
[46:16] lifeboat or a actual raft
[46:21] or a nice sailboat that you can just hop
[46:25] into or I mean you get to decide how
[46:30] much insurance you want to take out
[46:32] against this flood that is certainly on
[46:36] the way. I mean, this stuff happening
[46:38] with Trump's tariffs, I mean, uh, not to
[46:42] come out in favor or in opposition to
[46:45] those things, but I can tell you from an
[46:48] act a macroeconomic perspective,
[46:51] something radical needs to happen or
[46:55] there will be outright disaster. and and
[46:57] we can debate whether um tariffs I mean
[47:01] there's there's certain schools of
[47:03] economic theory uh inspired by Smith
[47:06] that you know just outright declares all
[47:09] tariffs to be evil and
[47:11] counterproductive. I'm not sure how true
[47:13] that is. And um you know, if you have an
[47:17] historical understanding of uh tariffs
[47:20] versus income taxes, it all it all
[47:23] becomes pretty muddy. But, you know, the
[47:26] the the market chaos that grew out of
[47:29] the of out of Trump's tariffs
[47:33] proposal, the fact that that could kick
[47:36] off these incredibly violent uh
[47:39] oscillations of the market just shows
[47:42] you how close to disaster we are. And
[47:46] whether you take the Trump approach of
[47:49] announcing 100% tariffs or you take the
[47:53] Biden approach of kicking the can as far
[47:56] down the road as you possibly can and
[47:59] denying reality, um, you know, it's
[48:02] going to end in there there are plenty
[48:05] of tears. You know, this this flood
[48:08] coming is is is going to be salty from
[48:11] tears. It's it's going to hurt a lot of
[48:13] people. And uh you know it's past time
[48:17] to be thinking about
[48:20] uh how to reduce the amount of wealth
[48:26] that you are storing in fiat currencies
[48:29] and in assets that have already been
[48:33] bidden up to multiples of their historic
[48:36] worth. Here I'm talking of course about
[48:38] equities and real estate. I mean, it's
[48:42] it's just it's just
[48:43] like some degree of divestment is
[48:47] appropriate and Bitcoin seems to be like
[48:52] a a a rational thing in which to stick
[48:57] at least some of your assets in the
[49:00] event that u that that things go off the
[49:05] rails. And uh yeah, I mean, you know,
[49:09] it's I as as as you know, I don't really
[49:14] make I'm not one of these guys to get on
[49:16] the podcast and you know, uh you know,
[49:19] you got Michelle McCrory saying, "What's
[49:22] your forecast?" She she inevitably goes,
[49:24] "What's your forecast?" She'll work that
[49:26] into every interview. and and it's like
[49:29] uh you know your your Bitcoin forecast
[49:33] giving somebody a number is like the
[49:35] cheapest way to get attention and uh I I
[49:41] don't have any forecasts
[49:43] uh other than uh I do think that some
[49:48] form of economic calamity is inevitable
[49:52] and I think that uh you know we are
[49:57] really on the precipice of
[50:00] uh not just increasing numbers of people
[50:04] but increasing numbers of corporations
[50:06] and nation states and uh and and United
[50:10] States states for that matter as seen in
[50:12] in New Hampshire and elsewhere uh
[50:15] getting on board and uh so on the one
[50:19] hand we have impending calamity and on
[50:22] the other hand we have impending God
[50:24] candles and I can't tell you when don't
[50:28] care about the price. One Bitcoin equals
[50:30] one Bitcoin, but things are going to
[50:33] change radically. And uh you know,
[50:36] Robin, if we accomplish nothing from
[50:38] this show other than to persuade a few
[50:42] people that owning zero Bitcoin, being a
[50:45] no coiner, is wildly
[50:48] irresponsible. If we accomplish nothing
[50:51] else from today's show than that, then
[50:56] as far as I'm concerned, this was time
[50:58] extraordinarily well spent.
[51:00] This is why I love going to conferences.
[51:04] Um because there I hear
[51:06] the the actual real life stories that
[51:10] the podcast has an impact on. uh in El
[51:13] Salvador, someone came up to me and said
[51:14] like, "Hey, my your my your podcast,
[51:18] like my podcast, um uh Orange Pill Me,
[51:21] it it was like the first uh Bitcoin
[51:23] video I saw and I just went down the
[51:25] rabbit hole and and went through all the
[51:27] guests and uh and and I bought Bitcoin
[51:30] because of the podcast and I'm like
[51:31] there's like I orange pill a person
[51:34] without even knowing them. And this is a
[51:36] real life impact I had in Bitcoin in the
[51:40] world and in his his his small uh in in
[51:43] his uh in his world. So like if if the
[51:48] podcast just does that that's already an
[51:51] an amazing accomplishment for for me. Oh
[51:54] hell hell yeah. And it's and I think
[51:57] that the um with this story you just
[52:00] told the the real impact of that story
[52:04] uh is is is not is not the moment that
[52:09] you heard that this person now owns you
[52:11] know x number of bitcoin. No, the real
[52:14] impact of that story is that it sounds
[52:16] to me like you've created a hodddler and
[52:19] that 50 years from
[52:22] now, this person and his family will
[52:27] still own some Bitcoin that they
[52:31] purchased this year as a result of
[52:33] listening to your show. So uh you know
[52:36] there's this
[52:37] um important concept you frequently hear
[52:40] from Bitcoiners about not just wealth
[52:44] but uh generational wealth. you know,
[52:47] the idea that like the Bitcoin I do I I
[52:50] buy today is uh going to be owned by my
[52:55] children and by their children and by
[52:58] their children like uh you know and and
[53:02] the fact that uh you know Robin you know
[53:05] your
[53:06] podcast the story is not that you
[53:09] encouraged you one guy to stop being a
[53:12] no coiner. the the the the real story is
[53:16] that you may have had a tangible
[53:18] difference in setting up a family
[53:22] uh to have assets that last
[53:25] multi-generations and that's the impact
[53:27] he had. I mean, which is pretty uh if
[53:31] that doesn't make you feel good about uh
[53:34] what you're doing
[53:35] and let you sleep like a baby, I don't
[53:38] know what will. I mean, I can't imagine
[53:40] anything more important than that.
[53:44] Thank you so much for those kind words.
[53:45] Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's almost
[53:48] scary to think of of uh what impact the
[53:51] positive impact you you can make with
[53:52] with just putting out the a video and
[53:56] and and trying to to do your best of
[53:58] educating people. Um I I there's like
[54:02] one aspect uh more of that and I I never
[54:06] uh talked about that on the podcast.
[54:07] It's is completely unrelated to Bitcoin,
[54:09] but I've seen that because you also
[54:11] write a lot. Uh I've seen that people
[54:14] who write extremely interesting guests.
[54:16] Like I don't know what it is with
[54:19] writing and and being an interesting
[54:20] person, but I see that those two are
[54:23] just correlated. I just wanted to to get
[54:25] it out because you you said previously
[54:27] you write a lot. Well, I I mean writing
[54:30] is just verbal expression and uh and and
[54:34] if you
[54:35] spend it it does change your brain. It
[54:39] it it it allow I mean if you spend uh a
[54:43] couple of hours a day writing the words
[54:45] come quicker, the words come easier. uh
[54:48] you know one of the one of the big
[54:50] cliches uh within and about writing is
[54:55] that uh writing is a muscle and uh if I
[54:59] spend three hours a day at the gym
[55:01] you're going to see it you know in my
[55:05] body if I spend three hours a day in
[55:07] front of my word processor u I'm going
[55:10] to express myself differently than if I
[55:13] didn't write you know just like if I
[55:15] played guitar for three hours a day I'
[55:18] I'd be somebody you would want to listen
[55:19] to. Uh you know, it all depends on where
[55:23] you're channeling your expression. But
[55:25] um I I think that uh yeah, I mean people
[55:30] people who write uh will I mean the
[55:33] there there there's basically two
[55:35] blessings that accompany writing apart
[55:37] from the actual books that are produced.
[55:40] The first the the first blessing is that
[55:43] uh immersing yourself
[55:45] in churning out words every day in and
[55:49] to the best of your ability will enable
[55:53] you to not only choose better words but
[55:56] to think more clearly and you'll and and
[56:00] this will impact the decisions you make
[56:03] and you'll make higher quality
[56:04] decisions. you'll have a happier and
[56:07] life and probably more wealth because
[56:09] you're thinking more clearly. And then
[56:12] the other thing is that
[56:13] um you know uh being being a writer uh
[56:19] can turn even pedestrian
[56:23] thoughts it can allow you to say them
[56:25] elegantly in a way that makes it uh less
[56:28] of a chore for people to listen to you.
[56:32] So, um, you know, like I couldn't have
[56:36] expressed that that uh last paragraph as
[56:39] well if I couldn't incorporate the word
[56:41] pedestrian into my into how I phrased
[56:45] this. And and without without the
[56:47] ability for words like that to come
[56:50] easily to mind, uh, you you may not be
[56:54] able to express yourself in in ways that
[56:56] uh that that keep people wanting to pay
[56:59] attention. It's it's a it's something uh
[57:03] I personally have to uh work on. I'm I'm
[57:05] not a writer at all. I'm actually failed
[57:07] in my English uh class and I almost
[57:10] failed in my German class. So like
[57:12] writing and speaking was never my my
[57:15] thing. But with the podcast, I I kind of
[57:17] get forced into it. Well, I I think that
[57:20] for for what you for what your podcast
[57:25] is about and what you do, uh the most
[57:30] important skill that somebody like you
[57:32] can have is is your ability to listen
[57:36] and to ask good questions. And for that,
[57:38] you don't you don't need to be David
[57:40] Foster Wallace or Richard Rhodess. you
[57:44] can just be a a regular person because
[57:48] you know I can make the case that uh
[57:52] people who can carefully listen are in
[57:55] even shorter supply than actual writers.
[57:58] Everybody wants to talk but uh you know
[58:01] the the amount of people who can
[58:03] actually dial in and pay close attention
[58:07] and listen and not just spend that time
[58:09] thinking of what they get to say next.
[58:12] uh that that puts you in into really
[58:14] rarified company if you can do that. So
[58:17] I I mean you're you've got all the tools
[58:20] you need. I mean the reason you've had
[58:21] so much success already with this
[58:23] podcast is because uh you I know how
[58:26] hard you work at it and you're you could
[58:30] not apply yourself with greater
[58:33] diligence to this work than than you're
[58:36] already doing. I mean, you've you've
[58:38] done some really impressive things and
[58:40] uh I'm I'm looking forward to see where
[58:42] you take this podcast over the next few
[58:44] years. Thank you so much. Yeah, it's
[58:46] it's I'm out of my rookie year now. I'm
[58:48] doing it now for
[58:51] uh 14 months uh full-time. Uh so I'm I'm
[58:56] out of my my first rookie year.
[58:59] Well, I if if I may, I just want to tell
[59:03] listeners who are on Twitter or Noster
[59:07] or god forbid Instagram, hey, tweet one
[59:10] of these shows, you know, get I mean,
[59:13] like if you do nothing else for Bitcoin,
[59:17] uh find find a uh find a find one of the
[59:21] podcast episodes from this show that you
[59:23] particularly like and make sure that a
[59:25] few friends listen to it. maybe they'll
[59:27] subscribe. But, uh, you know, if Robin,
[59:30] if you're not gonna ask for money or
[59:33] you're not going to be trying to sell
[59:35] things, you know, at least ask your
[59:36] listeners to step up and give this show
[59:38] a push. Uh, and I think um I think one
[59:42] of the greatest things that that
[59:45] um people don't realize that so much of
[59:50] your success either
[59:52] financially or in terms of moving the
[59:55] needle on something important is just
[59:57] your ability to ask. You know, can you
[60:00] can you make a a small reasonable
[60:04] requests that people will feel inspired
[60:07] to say, "Yeah, sure. I can do that. So,
[60:10] you know, I'll let me just ask on your
[60:13] behalf uh your listeners, hey, if
[60:16] there's an episode of uh that Robin has
[60:18] done recently that you think is
[60:20] particularly worth
[60:22] sharing, hey, can you take can you stop
[60:24] the podcast right now, go on to Twitter,
[60:27] go on to Noster and just tweet that
[60:29] episode and then come back. Uh and uh I
[60:33] mean that's the kind of thing where you
[60:34] can step up and really make a small but
[60:37] meaningful difference and and I think a
[60:40] lot of the recipe to having a happy life
[60:43] is to being able to stop what you're
[60:46] doing for a moment and help help a
[60:48] brother out. That's so sweet of you.
[60:49] Thank you so much. Yeah, it it does
[60:51] help. This does help a lot. I I want to
[60:55] get uh back to one more thing about the
[60:58] supply shock. Um because we have a lot
[61:01] of people that raise concerns. Oh, like
[61:03] we have all those great big companies
[61:05] coming into uh Bitcoin and buying a lot
[61:08] of Bitcoin like strategy semi-cientific.
[61:11] We have Black Rockck. I think last week
[61:13] it was like the they bought 5x or 10x
[61:15] the supply that was going
[61:19] min. Um are you at all concerned that
[61:23] they play around with paper bitcoin and
[61:25] and and and that uh thing? Uh well I I
[61:29] things have blown up before things have
[61:31] blown up again and it and if you're not
[61:33] going to do the self custody um I will
[61:37] say that
[61:39] uh
[61:41] I I think it is exceedingly
[61:45] unlikely that the likes of Fidelity or
[61:49] BlackRock will monkey around with paper
[61:52] Bitcoin when it comes to their ETFs. And
[61:55] I I I own some I own significant Micro
[61:59] Strategy stock too. So obviously I have
[62:02] bet that Sailor is uh is legitimate and
[62:08] a man of his word and uh not not trying
[62:12] to game things and uh I think he's
[62:15] acting on integrity and if I'm wrong I'm
[62:17] going to lose that investment. So I mean
[62:20] that's my bet. I'm not saying that I
[62:22] know for sure, but um I think the
[62:25] further the further away you stray from
[62:28] the likes of the Fidelity or Black
[62:32] Rockck ETF, the more likely you are to
[62:37] uh to be rugged or rugpulled. And uh so
[62:41] that's something you got to be careful
[62:43] about. But I I think that again for our
[62:48] hypothetical grandma who thinks that
[62:51] Facebook is the internet uh if she wants
[62:55] some exposure to Bitcoin and you know
[62:57] she may really understand that you know
[63:00] one bitcoin is one bitcoin and that this
[63:02] is true scarcity on an order you can
[63:05] never have in the physical world and
[63:06] that's and she gets that um then I think
[63:11] uh you
[63:13] she's it's going to be really hard for
[63:15] her to have a better way to gain a stake
[63:20] in Bitcoin than by buying the Fidelity
[63:22] ETF in my in my opinion. And I know that
[63:25] there's people who would just violently
[63:27] foam at the mouth and object to what I
[63:29] just said. But what I care more about
[63:33] than appeasing the purists is that
[63:36] grandma doesn't
[63:38] lose that generational wealth because
[63:41] she just didn't have the ability to take
[63:44] out some titanium seed plate and uh you
[63:49] know do a check sum on her node. I mean
[63:52] come on that's that ain't going to
[63:54] happen. So, you know, I mean, I guess
[63:58] the thing is that outside of my Bitcoin
[64:01] life and my own advocacy where I am a
[64:05] true subject matter expert, I'm
[64:07] fundamentally a pragmatist, you know, I
[64:09] I don't think that we're going to have
[64:12] that shining city on a hill that there's
[64:15] always going to be some amount of
[64:17]  and incompetence and and and
[64:21] uh nobody's always going to have the
[64:24] purest intention. ions and motivations
[64:26] in every way and things tend to fail and
[64:28] I I think like uh uh you have to meet
[64:32] people where they are and uh and and
[64:36] help them into a lifeboat.
[64:40] I very much agree with that and it's
[64:42] very very beautifully said and it's also
[64:45] the reality of self-custody. I think
[64:47] there is a um a spectrum of
[64:50] self-custody. You can make it as pure as
[64:52] you want. you have like uh in different
[64:55] cities in different continents multi-
[64:57] signature nobody else knows about like
[65:00] there's many different setups you can do
[65:02] uh but then there's also like the bit
[65:05] key which is a great solution for people
[65:07] that might not as be technical they just
[65:09] want to have like an Apple kind of
[65:11] device that is works uh seamlessly and
[65:14] then there is uh things like an exchange
[65:17] an ETF that is on another scale so I
[65:21] think we're just starting to see
[65:22] different solutions and they will come
[65:24] on all of the spectrum like a thousand
[65:26] more different solutions and there will
[65:29] be something for everyone and not
[65:30] everyone will have the full
[65:34] titanium seat plates and I do think that
[65:37] if you're going to if you're going to
[65:39] put more than the equivalent of say a
[65:41] thousand dollar US into Bitcoin it makes
[65:45] sense to have several different piles
[65:48] you know and I'm not going to advocate
[65:49] for any one thing but I mean
[65:51] hypothetically
[65:53] you know, maybe a little bit
[65:55] self-custodied and it may be a little
[65:57] bit FBTC and it may be a little bit
[65:59] micro strategy. You know, again, I'm I
[66:02] mean, you pick your own poison and I'm
[66:04] not suggesting any of those. I'm just
[66:07] saying that um if you have three
[66:09] different piles of Bitcoin exposure, the
[66:13] chance of them all getting hacked and
[66:15] vaporized or rugged goes to zero. Just
[66:19] avoid shitcoins. Shitcoins are not
[66:22] Bitcoin. And uh take this opportunity to
[66:25] go into Google and type ETH to BTC and
[66:30] uh bring up the one-year chart of that
[66:32] and you can watch Ethereum bleed out in
[66:36] real time as measured against Bitcoin
[66:38] because people have just lost trust in
[66:41] that entire ecosystem and the latest
[66:44] change of narrative to the latest shiny
[66:46] object. just stick with Bitcoin and uh
[66:50] find a way to gain some exposure to the
[66:53] limits of your ability. Yeah, look at
[66:55] that. That's the most beautiful chart on
[66:57] the internet, isn't it? Yeah, for the
[67:00] people that just listen um we I just
[67:02] pulled up the EF BTC uh chart and it's
[67:06] uh down
[67:07] 61% in the past year and it's actually
[67:10] even the past five years start. So the
[67:12] past 5 years had some small uprun and it
[67:15] was somewhere around the 2022 mark where
[67:19] I think they switched from proof of work
[67:21] to proof of stake and ever since that
[67:23] they're just going down in almost a
[67:26] straight line like it's it's a quite
[67:27] straight line honestly. Yeah. But the
[67:29] last few months that line down has even
[67:32] steepened. I just I could look at that
[67:34] chart all day and you know it needs a
[67:36] musical soundtrack and some animation.
[67:39] But uh I don't know my uh is is it your
[67:43] in in your language Robin? Do you do you
[67:45] have the word shot and Freud or is is
[67:47] that the adjacent language? It it's it's
[67:50] German. Yeah. Shenan Freud. It's like if
[67:53] you're happy that someone else is
[67:55] failing. Yeah. I I I conf I I try to be
[67:58] a good kind nice person, but I feel I
[68:02] feel endless shot in Freud uh about the
[68:05] fate of Ethereum and it just fills me
[68:09] with pleasure, un unalloyed pleasure.
[68:14] I think that's a great uh ending point
[68:16] for the podcast. We have two more
[68:17] questions as you know, one question is
[68:19] always the same for each guest. Um I
[68:22] actually don't know you. you were so
[68:24] early on. So I probably even I don't I
[68:26] didn't ask you um I always ask now
[68:30] guests uh um uh the the question what
[68:34] have you learned since the last episode
[68:37] uh we did outside of Bitcoin the first
[68:40] time they're on. So because I didn't ask
[68:42] you I always ask what can we learn from
[68:44] you besides Bitcoin? Well, I don't know.
[68:47] Uh I mean I I think u I think I you know
[68:52] my life in the last year or so I
[68:54] suffered a terrible loss and I've been
[68:57] uh just I I've really come to grips what
[69:01] with what grief is like. I never you
[69:04] never really there's two kinds of
[69:05] people. there's, you know, people who
[69:07] know grief tangentially and have
[69:09] experienced a little of it and I've
[69:12] experienced a lot and it's changed who I
[69:14] am as a person. Um, so that's what I've
[69:17] learned since the last show about how
[69:19] how deeply sad it's possible to be and
[69:25] um, yeah, it's changed me in a in a
[69:28] profound way.
[69:29] Um and I I I you know uh I guess I guess
[69:34] what I would say regarding that is that
[69:38] um you know
[69:41] it's you know beyond beyond Bitcoin
[69:44] everything you love could just vanish in
[69:47] a heartbeat and uh and and that until
[69:51] you truly experience profound levels of
[69:54] grief you can never really know what it
[69:56] is. Uh, so sorry for that bummer of an
[69:59] answer. Uh, but I mean that's that's
[70:01] made me into a a deeper person. Um,
[70:06] sorry. And so your second question, I'm
[70:10] sorry.
[70:12] It's I don't know if it's 100% fitting
[70:16] to what you just said, but I want to
[70:17] bring it up because I just tweeted about
[70:20] that today and it's extremely going
[70:23] viral. Actually, I've not not seen and
[70:26] that maybe it it fits nicely. Maybe not
[70:30] 100%. Um,
[70:32] uh, I I will just share that with
[70:35] you. I tweeted out this and it got 60k
[70:40] views. I never get 60K views on tweets.
[70:43] And and I basically made that picture
[70:45] where someone is running uh behind
[70:47] Bitcoin. He's stacking Bitcoin and then
[70:49] he has all the Bitcoin. is basically
[70:51] dying rich and and living living poor.
[70:54] And I'm I said make sure you use your
[70:56] Bitcoin to get more life, not giving
[70:58] more life uh to to Bitcoin. Uh and I in
[71:03] quotes I said like coming from a man who
[71:05] is working full-time in Bitcoin and
[71:06] devoting his whole life uh to Bitcoin.
[71:10] I I can tell you that the very first
[71:12] thing I do as soon as uh I get off this
[71:15] podcast is I'm going to retweet that uh
[71:17] cartoon image because it's it's pretty
[71:20] uh pretty dead on. I mean, I I still
[71:22] think like
[71:24] um what's funny is that my uh quality or
[71:28] the the things I buy, my purchasing
[71:31] decisions still haven't measurably
[71:33] changed. I just visited Hong Kong a
[71:35] couple of weeks ago and I stayed in a
[71:38] $40 a night hole apartment uh just
[71:41] because I I like to live kind of simply
[71:43] even though I don't need to do that
[71:45] anymore. Um but it should be
[71:51] um you know at the end of at the end of
[71:54] the day uh
[71:57] abundance is not really a function of
[72:00] money. Abundance is just, and Bashar
[72:03] says this, you know, abundance is just
[72:05] the ability to do what you need to do
[72:07] when you need to do it. And maybe that
[72:10] involves money, but more often than not,
[72:12] you can creatively do whatever it is you
[72:15] really want to be doing. And uh so at
[72:19] the end of the day, I mean, you know, I
[72:21] will say that
[72:24] uh being being a multi-pointer, I guess,
[72:28] being somebody who is uh certainly rich
[72:32] on paper,
[72:34] uh the real way it's changed my life, uh
[72:38] or the way it's added to my happiness is
[72:43] knowing that I
[72:46] could easily fly first class to Europe
[72:50] at the end of this month, you know, and
[72:53] it wouldn't change things at all. But I
[72:54] don't want to fly first class to Europe,
[72:57] you know. What I want to do is fly
[72:59] secondass to New York City for a hundred
[73:01] bucks on American Airlines, spend a day
[73:04] at New York City, stay stay at a halfway
[73:06] decent hotel, and then buy some offbrand
[73:11] $260 ticket to Norway and fly over
[73:14] there. and uh non-stop and for 360 bucks
[73:17] I get to Norway and I see people I love
[73:20] and you know it's how I got there and I
[73:23] guess I could have flown first class and
[73:25] knowing that I could fly first class is
[73:27] pretty cool but uh I don't need to fly
[73:31] first class and I don't want to fly
[73:32] first class uh but I I enjoy the fact
[73:36] that
[73:37] um I enjoy I enjoy the fact that I am
[73:42] finding a ways to accrete my total stash
[73:45] of Bitcoin and more to the point that
[73:48] I've never spent a Satoshi in the last
[73:51] 11 years. It's been a one-way valve for
[73:54] me. I've only accumulated. You know, I I
[73:57] think let's just to sum up this
[74:00] interview, let's just end with my saying
[74:03] that if you can't find a way for Bitcoin
[74:07] to make you
[74:09] happier, then you're doing it wrong.
[74:11] It's so beautiful. Uh, I I love it. I
[74:15] Well, it almost hurts me that I have to
[74:17] now uh ask you one more question, okay?
[74:20] Because we have an endotine where the
[74:21] previous guest is asking a question for
[74:22] the next guest without knowing who the
[74:24] next guest is. Uh, so I will I will just
[74:27] throw the question at you, but we
[74:29] already covered it a little bit as I
[74:31] said before. The question is, what's
[74:33] your best tip for orange pilling people?
[74:37] Oh, so I I should be answering that
[74:39] question, huh? Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um,
[74:42] well, I mean, I you're talking to a guy
[74:45] who spent six weeks writing an essay
[74:49] that I intend and hope will be people's
[74:54] default recommendation for orange
[74:56] pilling. So, um, you know, to sum up to
[75:01] to give you the best quick answer to
[75:04] your question that I possibly
[75:06] can, I I would say I I I would say grab
[75:11] your listener by the lapels and say you
[75:15] cannot be a no coiner. You know, do do
[75:18] not own I I'm not here to tell you how
[75:21] many Bitcoin you should own, but don't
[75:23] own zero. Get off zero. And please, you
[75:26] know, read this essay and if you know,
[75:30] obviously if you have something a
[75:33] resource that you preferred to my
[75:35] dncomply.com essay, please give that.
[75:38] But give them a place to start. Tell
[75:40] tell them number one, being a no coiner
[75:44] should be off the table in 2025. It's
[75:47] insane. Do not own zero Bitcoin. That
[75:49] should be your one message. And then
[75:51] give them a place to start, whether it's
[75:53] my essay or something else.
[75:55] Absolutely agree. I I cannot fathom that
[75:57] there are still people with zero bitcoin
[75:59] in 205. Um yeah, thank you so much uh uh
[76:03] Mr. Comply or uh do not comply. Um it
[76:08] was an honor. It was really cool to to
[76:10] speak again with you. Um thank you so
[76:12] much for your time. Any any last words?
[76:15] Robin, you're you're continuing to be
[76:17] one of the people who I I've called you
[76:19] the hardest working person in Bitcoin.
[76:21] And I don't know if that's true, but I
[76:22] know you're one of the hardest. and uh
[76:25] you know you get back what you put into
[76:27] it and the fact that you have applied
[76:30] yourself every single day that you have
[76:34] applied ass to chair as we've said
[76:36] before not to write but to podcast and
[76:39] you uh you make the kind of effort you
[76:41] do you're changing the Bitcoin landscape
[76:44] and uh you are making a really big
[76:47] difference and I and I'm just really
[76:49] honored that you had me back on for this
[76:51] second interview. So, thank you so much
[76:53] for that. Thank you so much that uh such
[76:56] kind words. Thank you so much also for
[76:57] your time uh to be on the podcast and
[77:00] also thank you so much for everyone that
[77:01] is watching and listening for joining us
[77:03] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
