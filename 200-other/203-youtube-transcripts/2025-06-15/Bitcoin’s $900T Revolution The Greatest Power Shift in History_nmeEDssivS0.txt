[00:00] when you approach Bitcoin from the hey
[00:02] we're going to replace Fiat currencies
[00:04] for peer-to-peer exchange and reduce
[00:06] eliminate intermediaries it becomes a
[00:08] threat to the political order nation
[00:10] states politicians don't want to give up
[00:12] control of their Fiat currencies in
[00:14] their Dominion Bitcoin wins no matter
[00:16] what I think there's a scenario where in
[00:18] the short term it loses if there is a
[00:21] gold problem there's a lot of trafi
[00:22] money that's sitting in Bitcoin and the
[00:24] Bitcoin price is set at the edge meaning
[00:27] that the last batch of capital that
[00:28] moves into Bitcoin sets the price some
[00:30] of that capital is going to say hey
[00:32] let's get out of Bitcoin let's go
[00:33] speculate on gold this gets the
[00:36] philosophical issue around how Society
[00:38] is organized the algebra of trading time
[00:41] for money now here's another source of
[00:43] Supply selling loan products to people
[00:45] who don't pay attention and they get a
[00:48] margin call and they lose their Bitcoin
[00:50] collateral so think of the idea of
[00:52] predatory loans you're going to see
[00:54] financial institutions use their loan
[00:56] products as a backdoor way to acquire
[00:59] Bitcoin
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] who are you like and what what are you
[01:06] doing in in Bitcoin and what is kind of
[01:08] your background to
[01:09] bitcoin yes so I have a small management
[01:11] consulting company uh focused on helping
[01:14] companies deploy Advanced Technologies
[01:16] into commercial
[01:18] agreements and um my company got
[01:21] into uh the whole crypto space back at
[01:26] the end of 2016 and we were looking at
[01:31] uh workflow automations and the part of
[01:34] the workflow automations we said hey
[01:35] well when this happens we're going to
[01:37] need to have tokenization of a
[01:40] Reconciliation of of terms of value
[01:43] money Etc and so we looked you know
[01:45] blockchain was a thing that popped up at
[01:47] that time we were working with IBM and a
[01:49] few others and uh obviously Bitcoin was
[01:53] at the center of the of the stage there
[01:56] so we started to uh educate our clients
[01:59] on
[02:00] Bitcoin related Technologies uh new
[02:03] currency Etc um and we also at that
[02:06] point in 2016 and 17 we were getting
[02:08] into I want to say the top 10 or 20
[02:11] altcoins uh because they all had
[02:14] different representations about use
[02:16] cases and things like that and so we all
[02:18] know what happened after that it was a
[02:20] crazy time in 2017 you know and so we
[02:23] kind of got away from it after the whole
[02:25] the whole thing blew up and really the
[02:27] focus became in more recent year
[02:30] the um the adoption of Bitcoin into the
[02:34] traditional Finance world uh as a store
[02:37] of value Asset and so it's really now
[02:39] coming in and becoming uh an interesting
[02:43] mechanism for trafi to uh basically
[02:47] reinvent all the products that it's had
[02:50] uh to drive tremendous value so right
[02:53] now my observation in the Bitcoin
[02:54] Community is there is a tension
[02:57] between uh Bitcoin as a store of value
[03:00] ethos which is where the trafi is coming
[03:02] from and the ogs who see it as a
[03:04] peer-to-peer
[03:05] uh token for uh money exchange and those
[03:10] things aren't mutually exclusive but
[03:12] they are different and they they come
[03:15] from different ethoses in terms of where
[03:17] people are coming from so uh I would I
[03:20] would further characterize it to say
[03:23] that um the Bitcoin as a transaction
[03:27] token is sort of a replacement for Fiat
[03:29] currenc CES whereas Bitcoin as a store
[03:32] of value as a replacement right now for
[03:34] gold and other store of value
[03:37] assets yeah and it's kind of amazing and
[03:39] and magical that we have those two
[03:42] things combined in in into one thing
[03:44] Bitcoin the token but also Bitcoin the
[03:46] network and it's all one thing but there
[03:49] there is a difference between like the
[03:50] network Bitcoin and and and the asset
[03:52] Bitcoin which are a lot of people are uh
[03:55] confused about it's really magical if if
[03:58] you if you I watched Michael sailor as
[04:01] many people do uh and look at his
[04:04] language
[04:06] around uh how he how he approaches the
[04:09] whole thing so he's walking into with
[04:12] MST uh and he's walking into what could
[04:15] be a highly regulatory environment
[04:17] highly political environment and he
[04:19] started to use the term digital
[04:22] property around uh referring
[04:25] to uh referring to bitcoin if you go
[04:28] back to bitcoin Nashville where he made
[04:30] his keynote speech he positioned Bitcoin
[04:34] as a store of value he looked hey
[04:36] there's 900 trillion dollars of assets
[04:39] half are utilitarian based assets half
[04:41] are store of value assets and of that
[04:45] 450 trillion he thinks that Bitcoin is
[04:48] going to uh grow in significant share
[04:50] over the next 20 years um the the
[04:54] there's a lot of opportunity in layer 2
[04:57] uh to create a Bitcoin foundation for
[05:00] transactional tokens but um as like a
[05:04] guy like Howard lutnick who's now the
[05:06] Secretary of Commerce
[05:08] says um when you approach Bitcoin from
[05:12] the hey we're going to replace Fiat
[05:14] currencies for peer-to-peer exchange and
[05:16] reduce eliminate intermediaries it
[05:19] becomes a threat to the political order
[05:22] uh nation states and politicians don't
[05:24] want to give up control of their Fiat
[05:26] currencies and their Dominion so while
[05:29] that may eventually become part of a
[05:31] Bitcoin standard and I think that's a
[05:33] strong possibility is something that
[05:36] happens years from now not tomorrow and
[05:38] really we want to get in my opinion as a
[05:41] bitcoiner we want to get Bitcoin fully
[05:44] established as much as we can into the
[05:46] ecosystem and right now that is through
[05:48] the store of value uh value
[05:50] proposition and it's it's a good point
[05:53] because um even satosi himself was very
[05:57] careful of what bit Bitcoin coverage is
[06:01] early on um where he he tried to not
[06:05] hype it up too much in the beginning and
[06:07] I I I think we are above the point of of
[06:11] it being destroyed by governments I
[06:12] think we are at the point of no return
[06:15] um but it's still valuable if the
[06:19] governments adopted faster and they will
[06:21] adopt it faster if uh there's a
[06:24] narrative around digital property and
[06:26] not let's destroy the fear system right
[06:29] right I think they're going to operate
[06:32] at least you know again it's fun to talk
[06:34] about what might happen in 20 years but
[06:37] I think for investment thesis you need
[06:39] to look at what's going to happen over
[06:40] the next one to five years uh when
[06:43] you're deploying capital and what's
[06:44] going to happen and over the next one to
[06:46] five years I think it's going to be a a
[06:49] system where they they coexist I don't
[06:52] think you're going to see a replacement
[06:53] in Fiat now I think you could see uh
[06:57] Bitcoin become a more of an IAL Reserve
[07:00] currency it could fall into a basket of
[07:02] other items uh you know recently this
[07:05] past U week or two I mean it's crazy how
[07:09] time time goes nuts with the Trump
[07:11] Administration coming in and really uh
[07:14] upsetting the apple cart quite a bit um
[07:17] but we have this issue with the the all
[07:20] the uh stuff around Fort Knox is the
[07:23] gold really there and they're going to
[07:24] do an audit and then there's evidence of
[07:27] gold coming out of the London vaults
[07:29] into into the US something's going on I
[07:32] don't know what's happening but you can
[07:34] see that a revelation of uh some some
[07:39] deficit around the stated reserves
[07:41] versus the actual reserves we haven't
[07:43] really done a full audit for 75 years
[07:46] there's been some spot checks now and
[07:48] then but imagine that there's a problem
[07:51] that would not be a surprise to me they
[07:53] have to manage that problem but imagine
[07:55] now they say okay let's 202 five let's
[07:59] reimagine what a uh a sovereign
[08:03] state uh Reserve System is and if I saw
[08:06] gold as of last century an analog
[08:10] Reserve Bitcoin is a for the digital age
[08:13] the digital reserve and so you can see a
[08:16] hybrid kind of situation evolving there
[08:18] but I I don't pretend to know I just
[08:20] speculate a lot with some of my friends
[08:21] on on Twitter and on the X bases um and
[08:26] it's a lot of fun to talk about what
[08:27] might happen in game theod out
[08:30] it's it's also interesting how the
[08:33] public might perceive it if there's like
[08:35] an actual audit and El might be a great
[08:39] guy for for actually doing that because
[08:42] he's he's probably one of the only uh
[08:45] people that actually would be crazy
[08:47] enough to say later like oh like I
[08:49] didn't see any gold there's actually
[08:52] nothing in there um uh but no matter
[08:56] what is in there how much is in there if
[08:58] there's something in there what do you
[09:00] think is the consequence if that
[09:02] public uh conversation is all of the
[09:05] sudden steering towards like how much
[09:07] gold do we have because a lot of people
[09:08] I think still believe that fear that the
[09:11] US dollar is backed by by gold uh and
[09:15] and maybe the the conversation gets
[09:16] steered in in in the direction like that
[09:19] I I think if there's a u uh an error
[09:24] that that is not substantial I don't
[09:25] think really too many people will care I
[09:28] think if it's a subst IAL like the
[09:30] vaults are empty let's take it in the
[09:31] extreme that would be that would be
[09:34] scandalous because they want to know
[09:35] what happened I think where the
[09:38] substantive issue matters is how the
[09:42] derivatives Market uh reacts so paper
[09:46] gold and physical gold are two slightly
[09:48] different markets so like for every
[09:50] physical ounce of gold there's anywhere
[09:54] from 100 to 300 claims on that same
[09:57] ounce so the through the rehypothecation
[10:00] so um we don't know there's not there's
[10:03] a lot of opacity in the market around
[10:06] exactly what that means but imagine that
[10:07] there's a problem and there's a rush for
[10:11] physical gold and people not allowing
[10:14] for thirdparty custody they're going to
[10:16] all want to have their own gold so
[10:18] they're going to take delivery that's
[10:19] going to create an unwind of the
[10:21] derivatives Market that may be a problem
[10:24] we don't want to see manifest and then
[10:27] people will care because it's it could
[10:28] affect the the broader Financial market
[10:31] so I don't know the answer to that
[10:33] question uh uh I hope smart people are
[10:36] looking at that and so it's like one of
[10:39] the metaphors I used in the conversation
[10:40] I had with some of my friends on on X
[10:43] was uh you don't want to pull the
[10:44] grenade the pin on the grenade until you
[10:47] know what you're going to do with that
[10:48] grenade once it once it's ready to go
[10:51] because even though it's not targeted
[10:53] for you you could be hurt by it and I
[10:55] think that's that could happen in the
[10:57] derivatives market so anyway we'll see
[11:00] what happens I hope there's a plan for
[11:01] it uh I think Bitcoin Bitcoin wins no
[11:05] matter what I think there's a scenario
[11:08] where in the short term it loses if
[11:11] there is a gold problem and what I mean
[11:13] by that is there's a lot of trafi money
[11:15] that's sitting in Bitcoin and the
[11:17] Bitcoin price is set at the edge meaning
[11:19] that the last batch of capital that
[11:21] moves into Bitcoin sets the price some
[11:24] of that capital is going to say hey
[11:26] let's get out of Bitcoin let's go
[11:28] speculate on gold
[11:30] while everyone's scrambling for physical
[11:32] gold so imagine gold sitting at around
[11:33] 3,000 now 2900 an ounce imagine that
[11:37] goes to four 5,000
[11:40] 8,000 you're going to see people with
[11:42] swing Capital move out of Bitcoin as a
[11:45] risk asset into gold and try to
[11:47] capitalize on that that'll depress
[11:49] Bitcoin in the short term uh to go chase
[11:51] the gold returns but long term I don't
[11:54] think it changes the story gold is an
[11:59] it's hard to store uh you can't divide
[12:02] it uh and it's not portable I mean you
[12:04] can't move it around so in the digital
[12:06] age it just doesn't make sense and I
[12:08] think Bitcoin uh ends up in the same
[12:10] place long term but in the short term it
[12:12] could be very different depending on how
[12:13] it plays
[12:14] out yeah like the the gold versus
[12:17] Bitcoin debates are are no longer
[12:18] debates for it's like I this is actually
[12:22] how I got orange buil I I was curious
[12:24] about Bitcoin uh and the first I think
[12:27] two three videos were actually just gold
[12:29] versus Bitcoin debates even though I was
[12:30] not in Gold like I actually didn't like
[12:33] gold but this what the most for me
[12:35] entertaining videos to watch so I
[12:36] watched them first uh and back then I
[12:39] was like oh like gold has a lot of value
[12:40] and then like and the more you study
[12:42] about gold and the more you study about
[12:43] Bitcoin you're like okay like it's okay
[12:45] to have some gold but you want to pick
[12:47] the winner it's
[12:49] Bitcoin yeah yeah well so you know I
[12:53] thought from 2007 and8 financial crisis
[12:57] or the 0809 crisis we I never thought we
[13:00] really cleared the problem we moved the
[13:03] problem from corporate balance sheets to
[13:06] Sovereign balance sheets and so at that
[13:08] point I never really thought we resolve
[13:10] the problem we kind of Kick the Can down
[13:12] the road and uh now how many years is
[13:16] that it's uh 17 years it's amazing to
[13:19] think it was so far ago but so at that
[13:22] time I started investing in precious
[13:24] metals because I thought those were
[13:26] Hedges against a uh a a Sovereign
[13:29] problem similar to the great financial
[13:31] crisis of of 08 and 09 well that never
[13:35] manifested and we keep you know the
[13:38] balance sheets of these of the Nations
[13:40] keep going up the US debt is over 36
[13:43] trillion it's growing how high can it go
[13:45] it's I I don't know uh but I I so I
[13:48] invested in Precious Metals so I was
[13:51] predisposed when I got ex when I got to
[13:54] studying Bitcoin to see its value in the
[13:57] ecosystem
[13:59] and so I I started you know I look I was
[14:01] looking at Bitcoin back in Max Kaiser
[14:04] early days you know I listened to him
[14:05] and it was like
[14:07] $40 and honestly I couldn't figure out
[14:10] how to how to buy it uh in a simple way
[14:15] and I was like saying you know maybe I
[14:17] figure it out but who am I gonna who am
[14:19] I gon to trade with I could barely
[14:20] figure it out and uh that was before the
[14:23] exchanges were set up and everything and
[14:25] you know back in the mount gaw days I
[14:27] said I'm not going to deal with this
[14:29] Japanese I don't know I I'm just not
[14:31] going to do it but I tracked it I
[14:32] followed it all the time and uh you know
[14:35] I regret not buying a a few hundred
[14:38] Bitcoin back then because it was only
[14:40] $40 uhh but I didn't and uh so I waited
[14:44] till about uh 2017 to start buying some
[14:48] and I wish I bought more back then as I
[14:50] do now my conviction is so much stronger
[14:52] today uh but I got I got orange pilled
[14:55] uh gradually and then once I saw what
[14:59] was happening with Bitcoin over the last
[15:01] few
[15:03] years um I really got going and then the
[15:06] last thing for me was the trafi adoption
[15:09] the January
[15:11] 24 uh ETF approval signaled very large
[15:16] Capital Pools the Trad fi Capital Pools
[15:18] now accepting Bitcoin as an alternative
[15:20] asset to stocks bonds and real estate
[15:22] gold Etc yeah it's it's also the reason
[15:25] that the story that you just told with
[15:26] buying Bitcoin is one of the reasons why
[15:28] I think think all the ogs are deserving
[15:31] of the massive upset they actually put
[15:33] away because if you think about if you
[15:35] actually held Bitcoin since the last
[15:38] let's say 12 years or 10 years or 13
[15:41] years whatever it is um you have gone
[15:44] through a lot not only the massive
[15:47] downsides the crashes but also the
[15:49] massive upsides like not selling Bitcoin
[15:52] when you up like thousands of percent uh
[15:55] but then also how you got in like you
[15:57] you you bought Bitcoin in in some weird
[16:00] way it's not like like now people think
[16:02] like oh like there's an Easy Exchange
[16:04] you could just like transfer money it's
[16:06] super easy it's it's done in like
[16:08] minutes that was not the case like 10
[16:11] years ago um so it it was harder and
[16:14] then also go through all those technical
[16:16] challenges of like how to store Bitcoin
[16:18] because m g those uh those got lost or
[16:21] like some maybe I got going getting back
[16:24] now there's so many other exchanges that
[16:25] get blown out uh people that did do self
[16:28] cust they lost a lot so everyone that
[16:30] held through their Bitcoin the last 13
[16:32] years they definitely deserved that well
[16:35] I when I did this for our company I
[16:37] actually hired somebody and their
[16:40] full-time their full-time job was to
[16:41] explain it to me right because you I was
[16:44] busy doing a lot of other stuff and I
[16:45] was trying to figure out you know I
[16:47] wanted to understand what I was doing I
[16:49] just didn't want to do it right I I
[16:50] wanted to because I was gonna I needed
[16:52] to explain it to others and their and
[16:53] clients and figure out what the broader
[16:56] application was so I'd ask a lot of
[16:58] questions like what secures the network
[17:01] what does proof of work mean what's a
[17:03] non how does the um degree of difficulty
[17:08] change you know all of these things
[17:10] because I I said you know I it's not
[17:13] just figuring out how to buy it it's
[17:15] figuring out what does it mean to the
[17:16] ecosystem and how might it be relevant
[17:19] uh going forward uh to moving that now
[17:23] at that time to be
[17:25] frank we I thought that Bitcoin at that
[17:29] time it had significant dominance you
[17:30] know if you remember there was this
[17:33] whole um I don't know how long it lasted
[17:35] but there was this whole flippening
[17:37] narrative that went on they thought
[17:39] ethereum would flip Bitcoin that the
[17:42] thought was that smart contracts were
[17:46] going to replace sort of the Bitcoin uh
[17:50] standard and architecture I thought that
[17:53] I thought that smart contracts would be
[17:55] the bomb in fact I still have a little
[17:58] bit of that in my head that I think uh
[18:02] smart contracts allow for what I was
[18:05] originally looking for in
[18:06] cryptocurrencies which was the
[18:08] automation of financial
[18:10] workflows so uh but it just didn't
[18:13] manifest uh and and and now it's turned
[18:16] in it's turned into something else now
[18:18] the smart contract thing May evolve over
[18:20] the next few years it's just not it
[18:22] didn't in 2017 I can tell you that and
[18:25] then you see all these altcoins
[18:27] happening you can't can't even keep up
[18:29] with it all it's uh it's like a casino
[18:32] of all the different things that are
[18:34] happening but people are doing it I I
[18:36] don't get wrapped around the axle like a
[18:37] lot of people you know saying oh it's
[18:39] all coins and things like that
[18:41] that's fun to do that I just don't care
[18:43] what other if people want to do things
[18:45] you know I was telling guys uh you know
[18:48] if we go to the restaurant I'm going to
[18:50] order a steak if you order a bowl of
[18:52] olives with ice cream in it I'm GNA be
[18:53] like whatever you want go get it you
[18:56] know uh I just don't care and so I I
[18:59] would I would if people ask me my
[19:01] opinion I'll tell them my opinion but I
[19:02] don't I don't I don't get I don't
[19:04] concern myself with what other people's
[19:06] decisions are I think that's an amazing
[19:09] analogy of like comparison of like um uh
[19:13] like if I eat a steak and you order
[19:15] something completely different what do I
[19:17] care what you eat um but at the same
[19:20] time if he asks me do you think it's a
[19:22] good idea to eat ice cream or steak you
[19:25] will tell them like oh like I think it's
[19:27] it's better to eat a steak than now ice
[19:29] cream and it's the same way I see it
[19:31] with with alins are like um I I don't I
[19:34] don't really care about them I don't
[19:35] really research them at all right now I
[19:37] see them as kind of a test net to to the
[19:40] Bitcoin uh but if someone ask me like oh
[19:42] should I buy an altcoin I'm like no hell
[19:44] no yeah of course not I I don't do it I
[19:47] I have leftover stuff that I owned from
[19:50] 2017 that I never sold uh it's most of
[19:53] it's all
[19:54] underwater I I bought ethereum back in
[19:58] the flipping days but I it was I don't
[20:00] know I paid like $300 for it so it's up
[20:03] 10x so but I don't have that much of it
[20:05] so it's I just have it you know I I'll
[20:08] probably get around to selling it at
[20:09] some point uh but it's not like it's my
[20:12] focus it's I I I bought a little bit of
[20:14] everything I bought some real junk you
[20:16] know like one one I bought back then and
[20:19] again everything we bought was had a
[20:21] purpose right it was like this's one
[20:23] called it was called digibyte and what
[20:26] it was doing was using the blockchain
[20:28] techn ology that was uh doing single
[20:32] sign on and
[20:34] authentication so uh because we that was
[20:37] a problem we were dealing with in this
[20:39] in our in our business deployments the
[20:41] that people had to log into five and six
[20:44] different systems it was very hard to
[20:46] maintain password controls and business
[20:48] controls and it it lowered productivity
[20:50] use and if you could do single signal
[20:53] authentication pass that token through
[20:55] the system you'd solve a lot of problems
[20:57] so I say hey digit bite that's what they
[20:59] said they were going to do we didn't do
[21:01] a lot of due diligence it just had a
[21:03] stated business purpose we said let's go
[21:04] buy some of that you know so we bought a
[21:06] bunch of it that went in the toilet
[21:08] nothing happened now the technology
[21:10] might be great it's just nobody adopted
[21:12] it um and again you can go through like
[21:14] 10 examples of that um you know when
[21:18] when the the the meme coin started
[21:19] coming out like the Dogecoin he's
[21:21] remember Elon mus started pushing it
[21:24] back in the day this is you know six six
[21:26] years ago or so uh you know we bought
[21:30] some just to say hey if he's getting
[21:31] behind it you never know what's going to
[21:33] happen with this so we bought it at
[21:35] three cents I don't know it went up to
[21:37] like you know 60 cents or 50 cents when
[21:39] he went on Saturday Night Live and then
[21:41] I just said this is this is Peak
[21:43] craziness and I sold it uh while he was
[21:46] on stage at on the Saturday Night Live
[21:48] show it was is probably one of my best
[21:49] trades because it it peaked out then but
[21:52] for the most part those are all
[21:54] just it's like betting on a sports game
[21:56] it's uh uh you know you can win you're
[22:00] more likely going to lose but the more I
[22:03] get closer to bitcoin I say it's really
[22:06] I I don't ever want to say a sure thing
[22:08] but it has the it has the elements of
[22:10] something that's extremely solid and a
[22:12] and once in a generation uh kind of an
[22:15] asset and if you believe for a moment
[22:18] that the next 15 years will look
[22:22] anything like the last 15 years in terms
[22:24] of its performance uh you'd be foolish
[22:26] not to have some exposure
[22:29] uh uh in your portfolio to bitcoin right
[22:32] now yeah and it it if you look at from a
[22:36] risk reward perspective in Bitcoin it's
[22:38] the by far the most attractive of any
[22:42] asset that you can possibly can have of
[22:45] like the risk is so low and the reward
[22:48] is so high of because risk of gold is
[22:52] also not that high like the the like
[22:54] gold will be around um it will be
[22:57] probably uh become more worth in terms
[23:01] of um uh in terms of field if you
[23:04] measure it in US dollars in terms of
[23:06] Bitcoin it will probably crash down as
[23:08] it has done the last 10 years but the
[23:11] reward of gold is not that that high you
[23:14] you you you will not make the the same
[23:16] return over the next 15 years and you
[23:17] will not preserve your financial energy
[23:19] in in in that good of a way as you do it
[23:22] with with Bitcoin and all of the other
[23:24] things like not transportable that the
[23:26] things we already covered before so like
[23:28] this is an interesting this is an
[23:30] interesting concept that I'd like to
[23:32] introduce and have a little discussion
[23:33] on when you look at I was on listening
[23:36] to a spaces yesterday with uh Peter
[23:39] Schiff and uh he was debating um some
[23:43] guys who are friends of mine and anyway
[23:46] so shiff
[23:49] conflates two concepts intrinsic value
[23:53] and extrinsic value and the and the
[23:57] intrinsic value of gold is you can make
[23:59] jewelry with it it's useful in
[24:02] electronics um it's
[24:05] non-corrosive uh it's malleable so you
[24:07] can those are attributes that are
[24:08] intrinsic to to gold and that has use in
[24:12] society so I don't know what the
[24:14] intrinsic value is but let's say it's
[24:17] $500 it's not more than that there's
[24:20] extrinsic value for gold which is a
[24:23] social construct where we agree that it
[24:26] is a reserve asset
[24:29] that if I have gold bars in a vault that
[24:31] that means something we agree as Society
[24:34] all the nations over the many hundreds
[24:37] of years where gold has become was has
[24:40] been
[24:40] money uh that extrinsic value is a
[24:44] social construct and it's highly it's
[24:46] highly sensitive to that social
[24:47] construct but that's where the price is
[24:49] set the price is not set to its
[24:52] utilitarian intrinsic value it's set by
[24:54] where we value the extrinsic value and
[24:57] it has and gold has a lot of history
[24:59] there now let's now take that same
[25:01] argument to
[25:02] bitcoin Bitcoin has intrinsic value and
[25:06] I would say the
[25:08] ogs who value the peer-to-peer exchange
[25:12] attributes that takes out third party
[25:14] intermediaries that allows us to
[25:16] exchange value without a consent from a
[25:18] bank or a third party that intrinsic
[25:21] value sets some value for Bitcoin it
[25:25] let's just make it let's just say that
[25:27] that number is 20
[25:29] $25,000 it's not the current price the
[25:33] current price is set by the extrinsic
[25:35] value of Bitcoin which is a social
[25:38] construct that is evolving around
[25:42] bitcoin's use as a store of value and
[25:45] that money is coming from trafi from
[25:47] Pension funds from uh large pools of
[25:50] capital who are looking to preserve
[25:52] their wealth and not see debasement from
[25:55] Fiat a pension fund is isn't remotely
[25:59] interested in using Bitcoin as a
[26:02] replacement for cash and Fiat it's
[26:05] looking for it to preserve its value now
[26:09] there will come a time where the
[26:10] intrinsic value will grow in its
[26:13] proportion of the overall value
[26:15] quotient but that's going to take some
[26:17] time but right now the game is on the
[26:21] extrinsic side which is and that's
[26:23] what's driving the marginal capital and
[26:26] so when I see these debates happening
[26:28] between gold and Bitcoin between within
[26:31] the Bitcoin Community between the ogs
[26:32] and the trafi crowd it typically
[26:34] devolves around a lack of clarity around
[26:38] arguing about intrinsic and extrinsic
[26:41] value and I get that also from a lot of
[26:44] um Norms of like oh like why does
[26:46] Bitcoin has value it is it's it's it's
[26:49] only valuable because uh some other one
[26:52] down the road might buy uh it for a
[26:55] higher price than you bought like that
[26:57] that greater full Theory uh is is an
[26:59] argument that actually here sometimes
[27:01] from Norm it's not that much actually
[27:03] it's it's a it's it's a smaller one but
[27:07] it it's it's the same with everything
[27:09] like value is subjective there there's a
[27:12] reason that things are priced and things
[27:15] are valued at at different rates uh and
[27:19] this financial premium like you say
[27:21] extrinsic value to it I I know it as as
[27:25] as Financial premium this is a a real
[27:28] thing and and it's so funny when gold
[27:30] bux come and say like oh like but but
[27:33] gold is jewelry and gold is used in
[27:35] smartphones and I'm like yeah but if
[27:37] it's only that then like why is it so
[27:41] much more valuable than silver or uh
[27:44] platin or like any Titanium or something
[27:47] like that like then they would be more
[27:50] valuable because titanium is used more
[27:52] than than golden in in technology right
[27:55] like there there are other metals that
[27:57] are way more used in in in other things
[27:59] than gold and gold is more valuable than
[28:01] them like like this is the financial
[28:04] premium so over my shoulder you can see
[28:06] right here I have a picture it's a
[28:08] Picasso it's a it's a
[28:10] print um it's one of my favorite Picasso
[28:14] paintings and I have it there to really
[28:16] illustrate a point right that because
[28:19] people when they ascribe value to
[28:21] something like whether it be gold or it
[28:23] be Bitcoin it's important again to make
[28:26] the distinction between intrinsic and
[28:27] extrinsic value so if I look at art art
[28:31] has both characteristics as well there's
[28:33] an intrinsic value to Art which is in
[28:36] the aesthetic realm is I like the
[28:38] painting it decorates my room here I
[28:42] enjoy looking at it all of the above and
[28:45] and people have different tastes in art
[28:48] you might not like that painting I do I
[28:50] may not like paintings in your house but
[28:52] you like them then there is the
[28:54] extrinsic value of art so that I got
[28:58] bought that print in Paris for I don't
[29:01] know $20 it was in the gift shop at the
[29:04] Picasso Museum the the original is
[29:07] hanging in the museum and it's probably
[29:09] worth $40
[29:12] million um in the aesthetic realm the
[29:17] original and the print offer very little
[29:20] difference if I hung the original I hung
[29:22] the a copy and the copy was a good
[29:26] copy it would be no different there
[29:28] would be equivalent value and when you
[29:31] go into the digital realm copies you
[29:33] know like nfts and things like that they
[29:36] in the aesthetic realm the intrinsic
[29:38] realm they're identical where you see
[29:41] differences is in the extrinsic realm we
[29:44] agree societally the Art Market is an
[29:47] established Market that the original
[29:50] Picasso we all agree it's worth a lot
[29:53] you may say that's crazy I don't relate
[29:55] to that well what you're what you're
[29:57] what you're doing is you're conflating
[29:59] intrinsic and extrinsic value and uh
[30:03] that's again it's it's an important
[30:05] exercise to go through when when you're
[30:06] looking at valuing things that have both
[30:10] components and Bitcoin has both
[30:12] components gold has both components if I
[30:14] look at fiat currency a US dollar or a
[30:18] Euro the paper money has zero intrinsic
[30:22] value it has huge extrinsic value
[30:25] because we all agree that I can trade
[30:28] goods and services for that piece of
[30:30] paper but if if if that
[30:33] societal uh construct were to be eroded
[30:37] that piece of paper would be worth
[30:38] nothing and we saw that in Germany in
[30:42] the 1920s when people would burn money
[30:44] to heat their homes because it had no
[30:46] extrinsic value right its intrinsic
[30:49] value became using it for fuel to light
[30:52] to heat in their
[30:54] fireplaces people would carry money
[30:56] around in wheelbarrows because it was
[30:57] just garbage
[30:58] and so we've seen that happen before uh
[31:01] when there's a loss of extrinsic value
[31:02] for Fiat so again I think it's a helpful
[31:05] construct for people to think about
[31:07] which is intrinsic versus extrinsic and
[31:09] separate them when you assess value for
[31:12] a particular asset I partnered up with
[31:15] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:17] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:20] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:23] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:26] made in perfect B Bitcoin watch that's
[31:29] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:32] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:35] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:38] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[31:41] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:45] watch collections you have the date of
[31:47] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:50] there and of course also the block
[31:53] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:56] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:59] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:01] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:04] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:07] love those watches so so much if you
[32:10] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[32:12] regular basis I'll guess you already
[32:14] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[32:17] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[32:20] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[32:23] personal recommendation for Hardware
[32:24] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[32:27] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[32:55] protect your privacy you have to to set
[32:58] up an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:01] where you live you even want to have a
[33:03] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:06] in case something goes really really
[33:08] wrong and through all those steps the

[33:19] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[33:22] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:24] which brings an interesting point up of
[33:27] like
[33:28] the financial premium like the extrinsic
[33:31] value is also depending
[33:33] on people saving money if people can
[33:37] save money in the base monetary layer
[33:40] that they they have like if they have uh
[33:43] euros and they are incentivized to spend
[33:46] their
[33:47] money be on an ETF or like art or
[33:50] something like that what do you think
[33:51] will happen if we actually come on the
[33:54] other end in like let's say 200 years to
[33:57] bit
[33:58] standard uh and uh we don't have an
[34:02] inflating base layer uh of that what
[34:06] influence will that have on on Art and
[34:08] and and those things who have a lot of a
[34:13] lot of extrinsic value so let let me
[34:16] reframe the question and I think is what
[34:17] you're asking right now we have money
[34:20] that is designed in the Fiat world to be
[34:23] inflationary which is an incentive to
[34:26] spend it so I if I sit on on cash uh uh
[34:31] it it doesn't make any sense because
[34:33] eventually that purchasing power is
[34:35] going to erode so it's an incentive to
[34:36] spend the higher the inflation the
[34:38] higher the incentive to spend when you
[34:41] move to a deflationary environment where
[34:43] the money is actually
[34:44] appreciating uh there's a disincentive
[34:47] to
[34:48] spend and um I see that now like so I
[34:53] have a a fold credit card it is a or the
[34:56] fold debit card
[34:58] you
[34:59] deposit uh money onto the debit card and
[35:03] it sits in either dollars or Bitcoin you
[35:05] choose the mix and so I put some in uh
[35:09] Bitcoin and I keep the others in dollars
[35:10] and I spend the dollars but I never go
[35:12] in the other direction I never take the
[35:14] Bitcoin and want to spend it I never
[35:16] want to go uh I never want to go buy a
[35:21] um I don't want to
[35:23] spend you know 10,000 SATs on a beer
[35:27] because I may look back and say I just
[35:30] spent $100 on a
[35:32] beer right so I just because I think I I
[35:35] don't want to spend an appreciating
[35:36] asset for a depreciating good so I think
[35:39] there's some some real issues for us to
[35:41] Think Through I I don't pretend to have
[35:43] the answer but I think it gets to the
[35:47] idea of how we view money and wealth in
[35:49] society and how we
[35:52] measure uh that in society so right now
[35:55] we measure GDP which says more is
[35:58] better and we might find ourselves in a
[36:01] deflationary money system where more is
[36:04] not
[36:05] better right that there's different
[36:07] metrics that we use uh to determine what
[36:10] is good because if I have um if I have
[36:15] uh plenty of
[36:17] money uh and it's dep and it's
[36:19] increasing in value I'm going to have
[36:21] more money tomorrow than I had today
[36:22] that's a complete flip of today's
[36:25] Paradigm yeah it's that
[36:27] that that sometimes comes from uh like
[36:30] when I argue with like uh economics uh
[36:34] people from the Kan and economic side of
[36:36] of like oh like when people don't spend
[36:38] anymore on a Bitcoin standard uh and
[36:41] yeah definitely that spending Behavior
[36:43] will change and I I noticed myself like
[36:45] I have now uh Bitcoin and Fe income uh
[36:49] and I try my best to never have to touch
[36:52] my Bitcoin income but at some point I
[36:53] will have to probably this year um but
[36:57] even on a Bitcoin standard every person
[37:00] still has a positive time preference so
[37:02] they still value the present time uh in
[37:06] in in a greater sense of like okay do I
[37:10] have the choice of not living in a in a
[37:13] good house with my family right now or
[37:16] do I want to be on the street uh but
[37:19] have more Bitcoin people will choose the
[37:22] house and people will pay their rent and
[37:24] people will pay for food but they will
[37:27] um pay more aware of it they they will
[37:31] choose it in in in a more um um
[37:34] meaningful way I think so Robin think of
[37:39] U this this gets the philosophical issue
[37:42] around how Society is
[37:44] organized uh the algebra of trading time
[37:47] for
[37:49] money right so people will will trade
[37:52] time for
[37:53] money and um historically
[37:58] younger people who don't have a lot of
[38:00] money but have a lot of time will trade
[38:04] more uh more fluidly someone with who's
[38:08] older like I'm I'm 61 right uh I have a
[38:12] different view right so if you have
[38:14] plenty of money but not a lot of time
[38:16] you're very cautious about trading time
[38:20] for
[38:21] money and so it's important for
[38:23] bitcoiners to think through that algebra
[38:26] for them personally for their situation
[38:28] how do they want to spend their time and
[38:31] their their their
[38:33] money uh and have a life that that is
[38:37] you know something that they that they
[38:39] enjoy now I think one of the things you
[38:42] mentioned before about you don't want to
[38:43] spend your your Bitcoin income and your
[38:45] Bitcoin assets that's appropriate that's
[38:47] a completely rational response and there
[38:50] may come a point in time where uh in
[38:53] order for you to make and support the
[38:55] life decisions that you make you you may
[38:57] have to do that I'm hoping that trafi
[39:01] comes up with products that allow us to
[39:04] borrow against our Bitcoin
[39:06] Holdings and rather than to sell them so
[39:10] I've done if you follow some of my feeds
[39:13] uh I I put a lot of uh stuff out there
[39:15] on bitcoin loans and Loan product
[39:18] development uh for uh what's likely to
[39:22] come and an example would be I've got a
[39:25] stack of of 10 or 20 or whatever how
[39:28] many Bitcoin people have uh and that has
[39:31] a certain value and then I borrow
[39:33] against that and and a basically a
[39:35] collateralized loan and then I use the
[39:39] the whatever the fiat currency is where
[39:40] you ever happen to live and I spend that
[39:44] and at some point I have to settle the
[39:46] loan but Meanwhile my collateral is
[39:48] expanding faster than the loan rate so
[39:51] if I'm borrowing money at 10% and
[39:53] bitcoin's growing at 40 or 50% I'm
[39:55] making a nice spread there so I'm not
[39:59] having to spend an extremely valuable
[40:02] asset to say fund a wedding or a
[40:04] vacation or a new home I'm borrowing
[40:06] money and paying for that over time and
[40:08] I'm using less and less Bitcoin over
[40:10] that
[40:12] time I would love to do that but
[40:15] currently I don't see an attractive
[40:18] product out there I I do think there
[40:20] will
[40:21] come something where I'm like oh like
[40:23] that's such great terms that I have to
[40:25] do it but right now I see high interest
[40:28] rates low low time durations uh and and
[40:32] or uh not having control over my Bitcoin
[40:35] and I want to keep them in some kind of
[40:37] multi signature where like they have a
[40:40] key I have a key some at least I want to
[40:42] see where they are uh uh so they cannot
[40:45] move them without me knowing uh and
[40:48] stuff like that so um but I do hope
[40:51] there are good products coming along our
[40:53] way so think of this product and it
[40:55] hasn't been developed yet but here are
[40:56] the attributes that would be like to me
[40:59] ideal where people would do this uh you
[41:02] get in-kind distributions in and out of
[41:05] the
[41:05] ETFs so I'm able to take Cold Storage
[41:10] Bitcoin transfer it into ibet the Black
[41:13] Rock ETF Black Rock gives me a loan
[41:17] against that a collateralized loan you
[41:20] want to keep the loan the value ratio
[41:22] very low so you never get liquidated the
[41:25] loans you keep them the time ation you
[41:28] you can refinance it constantly so long
[41:32] as your loan the value stays low and
[41:34] then when I'm ready to settle up I
[41:37] settle up hopefully with my asset now
[41:39] much
[41:40] appreciated and then I am able to pull
[41:43] my collateral out back in the cold
[41:46] storage without tax events so maybe I
[41:49] put 10
[41:50] in I borrow some money keeping the LTV
[41:53] loan to value I'd keep it below 20% Then
[41:56] You're really at really very little risk
[41:58] of uh liquidation you'd have to be
[42:02] catastrophic and then uh I live I use
[42:05] that for whatever college education a
[42:08] home uh wedding whatever whatever people
[42:11] spend money on and then when I'm ready
[42:13] to settle up I settle up and uh instead
[42:16] of uh and maybe I pull out
[42:19] 9.5 or nine Bitcoin and I put in 10 but
[42:23] if I sold it at the outset I may have
[42:25] had to sell two or three Bitcoin and I
[42:27] only have seven at the end so I think
[42:30] again you got to play around with these
[42:32] numbers and figuring it out I think
[42:33] those kind of things are going to are
[42:35] going to be valuable I think you got to
[42:36] get the APR the interest rate on the
[42:39] loans probably closer to 10% right now
[42:42] most of the ones I look at are in the
[42:44] 15% or higher that's a little too high
[42:48] 10% feels about right to me uh for what
[42:51] that product is especially since it's
[42:53] collateralized and the other one is have
[42:55] a floating interest rate based on the L
[42:57] TV so if you're very low LTV you can get
[42:59] a a much better rate um but those
[43:02] products are going to develop and here's
[43:04] why they're going to
[43:06] develop you you probably read just like
[43:09] I do lots and lots of large Capital
[43:11] Pools Sovereign wealth funds Pension
[43:14] funds uh there's talk about State
[43:17] reserves in the US and nation state
[43:19] reserves these are big big money pools
[43:22] and they're slow to act but when they
[43:24] act they're a little price
[43:26] indiscriminate they're is going to
[43:28] buy it's going to be harder and harder
[43:30] to buy Bitcoin at scale all right the
[43:33] the only Supply that comes online is to
[43:36] convince people who have it that they
[43:37] they should
[43:39] sell right so you have some Bitcoin I
[43:42] have some Bitcoin right uh and the price
[43:45] right now is I 96,000 something like
[43:48] that if it goes to 106 are you going to
[43:51] sell I'm not no okay if it goes to 116
[43:55] are you GNA sell I'm
[43:58] not but if it goes to a million dollars
[44:01] I'm probably going to sell some so
[44:03] that's the only Supply that's going to
[44:05] come online for big now here's another
[44:07] source of Supply selling loan products
[44:10] to people who don't pay
[44:12] attention and they get a margin call and
[44:16] they lose their Bitcoin collateral so
[44:18] think of the idea of predatory loans
[44:21] you're going to see financial
[44:23] institutions use their loan products as
[44:25] a backd door way to ire Bitcoin and so
[44:28] this is why it's extremely important for
[44:30] people to do their homework and
[44:32] understand how these products work they
[44:33] can work to your advantage uh but just
[44:36] because they allow you to do it doesn't
[44:38] mean you should you have to set your own
[44:40] parameters and the parameters that I
[44:41] would set are don't go above a a 20% LTV
[44:45] right now that's that's the max if you
[44:47] go up to 60 70% we get a draw down
[44:50] you're going to get cleared out so I I
[44:52] wouldn't do it but even if it goes let's
[44:56] say uh crazy to like a million in in one
[44:59] year I wouldn't know what to sell it for
[45:04] like maybe I'll fulfill a small dream of
[45:07] mine maybe I uh I don't know um U level
[45:12] up something but this is all like
[45:13] lifestyle things like but I probably
[45:16] won't do it but what other asset would I
[45:20] sell it for Robin let's so I agree
[45:22] that's that's a that's a fair point what
[45:24] what would you sell it for what would be
[45:27] uh I would say um let's change the word
[45:31] to spend it instead of selling it so
[45:34] what would you do I would I would spend
[45:35] it so like if Bitcoin goes up to say 250
[45:40] just pick a number I I I've already talk
[45:43] with my wife like things that we would
[45:44] do differently right one thing that I I
[45:47] kind of always wanted to do would is to
[45:51] uh get an apartment in Paris and just
[45:53] live there for I know three months you
[45:55] know how much does that cost
[45:57] I $50,000 $60,000 to go do that I don't
[46:01] know just pick a number you can live
[46:03] luxury and do spend as much as you want
[46:05] but this you know that's to me it's a
[46:07] luxury thing I would go do and uh we'll
[46:12] probably do that maybe we take a trip
[46:13] around the world or or or do some life
[46:16] experiences as you get older I think
[46:19] about my my children and
[46:22] grandchild what do I want to do with
[46:24] them do I want to set up a Family Trust
[46:26] uh and how should I be thinking about
[46:27] the conveyance of generational wealth is
[46:31] that even a good idea to do it it's not
[46:33] just oh I want to you imagine giving in
[46:36] the extreme let's say say you have lots
[46:38] and lots of money you give $5 million to
[46:43] every every grandchild when they're born
[46:45] that' be crazy you could you could mess
[46:47] their whole life
[46:48] up right you'd Rob them
[46:52] from experiencing life and the way that
[46:55] maybe you did where you had to work hard
[46:58] and earn it defer gratification and all
[47:00] that so it's not a slam dunk just to say
[47:02] you want to go do that so I think
[47:04] there's a lot of things that bitcoiners
[47:06] should think about if they get more
[47:08] wealth than they could possibly consume
[47:10] what they're going to do with it you may
[47:11] want to give it to charity you may want
[47:14] to create a foundation and create a
[47:15] better world you may want to create a
[47:17] family foundation and ensure that your
[47:19] family has a safety net but not an
[47:21] excuse not to do anything with their
[47:24] lives these are philosophical questions
[47:26] that I think a lot about and talk with
[47:28] some of my friends on X uh because it's
[47:31] not just about the number going up it's
[47:33] about what's the implications if it does
[47:35] go up how are you going to live your
[47:37] life it's a really interesting question
[47:39] of like G giving uh money to kids uh
[47:44] like the optimal thing would be to not
[47:49] give them money but give them the
[47:51] knowledge and the the mindset and all
[47:53] the values that they can do it then and
[47:56] uh they get so Farine in life that once
[47:59] they actually get your money it doesn't
[48:01] really make a difference in their life
[48:03] like I think that would be the the best
[48:05] case where like like yeah they they they
[48:08] get you five million but you already
[48:09] have 10 then they like oh it do an
[48:12] extreme example of an successful father
[48:15] and sucessful son uh but like that that
[48:18] would be I think like the best case uh
[48:20] where you have generational wealth and
[48:24] the kid actually went himself through
[48:27] those uh those stories and learnings
[48:29] yeah I I I look it's I I don't have a uh
[48:33] I don't have a secret recipe I just
[48:35] think it is worth thinking about when
[48:37] you use the term trust fund baby uh it's
[48:40] usually not a a positive statement or
[48:44] positive images do not come to mind uh I
[48:47] think for every good story of somebody
[48:48] who received intergenerational wealth
[48:50] there's probably three to five bad
[48:52] stories so I think you have a
[48:54] responsibility if you're going to do it
[48:55] to think it through and also again think
[48:58] look the people who have had wealth
[49:01] before they were smart about how they
[49:03] created foundations to to create uh a
[49:07] better world around them pick a charity
[49:09] that or a cause that you think is uh
[49:12] dear to what you would find important
[49:15] and go make it happen look for look for
[49:18] areas to go do that it's actually at
[49:21] some level a selfish act to do it right
[49:23] because you get a the people I know who
[49:26] have a lot of money
[49:27] who've who've donated it to causes that
[49:29] they find important to them they get a
[49:32] tremendous amount of self-satisfaction
[49:33] at doing
[49:35] that it's if so for them it's I mean you
[49:40] could you could say cynically it's
[49:41] almost a selfish act for them to give
[49:43] the money away right because they're
[49:45] they're getting something greatly out of
[49:47] it and it's it's important to go think
[49:49] through these things we're going to see
[49:51] you know what the other area of my
[49:53] Consulting business is around AI
[49:55] Technologies and again you add crypto Ai
[49:58] and some of the other trends that we're
[49:59] seeing in in uh anthropology and
[50:03] politics our world is going to change
[50:06] dramatically over the next five to 10
[50:09] years and uh people should start
[50:12] thinking about the various scenarios of
[50:15] how it's going to change and how they're
[50:16] going to be positioned you know and
[50:19] bitcoin's just a piece of it and I go
[50:21] back to sailor's uh keynote speech in
[50:24] Nashville and I was I was there I had a
[50:27] uh great seat watching that um he said
[50:31] you know the Bitcoin can solve half of
[50:33] our problems but not the other
[50:36] half so there's a whole rest of what
[50:40] constitutes life and society that is not
[50:44] Bitcoin related that Bitcoin could
[50:47] enable solutions to happen but it
[50:50] requires you to go do them and so again
[50:54] a lot of the attention we get on Spaces
[50:56] when I talk to all my my my spaces
[50:59] friends and people on X is around the
[51:02] progression of price and how high it's
[51:04] going to go and the path ETC number go
[51:07] up kind of stuff but I would like to see
[51:11] us as Bitcoin goes up this year to start
[51:14] shifting some of our conversations to
[51:16] the so what well what are you going to
[51:18] do about it now how is it going to
[51:19] change your life what are you going to
[51:22] do uh to make your life and the world
[51:25] around you better your family life your
[51:27] friends your community that you live in
[51:30] that's extremely important also thinking
[51:32] about if Bitcoin actually works out how
[51:35] much wealth the bitcoiners that are now
[51:38] into Bitcoin will have and how much
[51:41] impact they can do in the world by
[51:45] Distributing and uh allocating those
[51:48] resources in the in the best possible
[51:50] way for Humanity it's it's something
[51:54] really um that I think on the podcast we
[51:57] only talked about that like maybe 10
[51:59] times in 400 episodes so that's
[52:01] something that's a conversation that we
[52:03] have to have more um but right now it's
[52:06] still like so early that it's um that
[52:09] people cannot imagine that like 15 years
[52:12] how many wealthy bitcoiners are there uh
[52:16] that can actually make a difference in
[52:17] the world with uh yeah supporting the
[52:20] the right
[52:21] costes yeah and again think of again
[52:25] using the network networks that people
[52:27] have created the social networks around
[52:29] the Bitcoin Community I made a lot of
[52:31] friends over the past few years people I
[52:33] consider very good friends from Bitcoin
[52:37] and uh uh we've already started having
[52:40] these conversations about what to do
[52:42] with it how to make the world a better
[52:43] place uh setting up businesses educating
[52:47] people being uh uh solving problems
[52:50] within your community um I just think
[52:53] it's it's something for people to think
[52:55] about it it's not a
[52:57] uh I don't think people will get joy in
[52:58] their life by pursuing purely selfish
[53:02] interests I don't think it's uh I don't
[53:04] think it's good for them and it's
[53:05] certainly not good for their family to
[53:07] do that absolutely um really cool one um
[53:11] uh question that came up to me um I
[53:13] think like 50 minutes ago when we were
[53:15] talking H how do you think uh tread fi
[53:19] will restructure because of Bitcoin like
[53:21] when we when we come now into more and
[53:24] more Bitcoin Focus world where we see
[53:27] nation states wealth funds and and all
[53:30] those players coming into Bitcoin how
[53:31] will this change the game around
[53:34] traditional Financial uh space well I I
[53:37] think you're going to see uh a
[53:40] tremendous amount of
[53:41] innovation as we go through this next
[53:43] phase so let's say so we so let's let's
[53:46] talk about it in phases right so we've
[53:48] had Bitcoin approved into the trafi
[53:52] world and there's been slow there's been
[53:54] somewhat slow adoption but I would say
[53:55] it's more methodical adoption it just
[53:57] takes a while for these bureaucracies to
[53:59] get behind it but they will now we're
[54:02] going to approach the probably for the
[54:04] next couple years an innovation phase
[54:06] where all the old trafi products are now
[54:10] going to be reimagined with a Bitcoin
[54:13] standard or a Bitcoin ethos or
[54:16] incorporation to that products so loans
[54:19] loans are now going to be Bitcoin based
[54:21] loans and how maybe I use a Bitcoin
[54:24] collateral and I get a different
[54:25] construct
[54:27] uh there's going to be lots of different
[54:28] things but you're going to see all kinds
[54:30] of financial
[54:31] innovation in if you look at what black
[54:34] rock is doing they want to uh tokenize
[54:38] real world Assets Now it's not strictly
[54:41] related to bitcoin per se but it's using
[54:43] some of the Bitcoin ethos of
[54:46] transparency of all ownership and
[54:49] transactions on a ledger based system
[54:51] whether it's blockchain or another
[54:53] technology but then linking those real
[54:56] world assets
[54:58] to a Bitcoin integration all these
[55:01] things are going to get done I would
[55:03] follow like what black rock is doing
[55:05] they're probably the most Progressive
[55:06] thinking but and they're also one of the
[55:08] more powerful organizations so I see
[55:10] you're going to see a lot of innovation
[55:11] they're going to reinvent uh uh trafi I
[55:15] think you're going to see AI come into
[55:18] it and you're G to
[55:20] see uh AI dis intermediate a lot of the
[55:24] trafi world
[55:26] uh that is using people to do certain
[55:28] things so think of wealth advisors at
[55:32] some point do I want to have ai do that
[55:34] versus a wealth
[55:36] advisor especially if it becomes if the
[55:38] AI has agency if it has the ability to
[55:41] do things for me um you know the wealth
[55:45] advisors are primarily focused on the
[55:50] older generation as that generation ages
[55:52] out younger people are going to say I'm
[55:53] not using that I'm going to just like
[55:55] they don't read a newspaper they're
[55:56] going to use technology to do it so I
[55:58] think you're going to see Innovation I
[56:00] think you're going to see disruptions
[56:01] from technology now I go five years out
[56:04] this is when I start to see digital
[56:07] tokens and I and I use that term versus
[56:10] blockchain and and Bitcoin because I'm
[56:12] not sure how it's all going to play out
[56:14] architecturally but in the most broad
[56:16] Sense Digital tokens being used more and
[56:20] more in Daily
[56:21] Commerce and um right now the
[56:25] regulations and the
[56:27] there's a lot of entrenched interests
[56:28] that don't want that to happen but that
[56:30] that will loosen up and we'll start to
[56:32] see things at the consumer level where
[56:35] we might gamify consumer behaviors where
[56:39] uh I have a wallet on my phone and it
[56:43] has lots of different tokens and
[56:45] currencies and I'm and and and they
[56:47] interact with one another and it drives
[56:51] my behavior it says oh I want to go to
[56:53] that restaurant uh today these tokens in
[56:57] my wallet are worth 3x at the restaurant
[57:00] let's go there so I now I got a deal and
[57:03] so the restaurant uses that to drive
[57:04] foot traffic and it gamifies the whole
[57:07] system and so I can see technology and
[57:10] tokenization that's going to come and
[57:12] we're going to see what what will emerge
[57:14] will be at the base layer Bitcoin
[57:17] because it is it's has an intractable
[57:20] Supply a fixed Supply and uh I think
[57:23] that's going to be an attractive
[57:24] attribute for people in a world that's
[57:26] grown up in this propagate uh fiat
[57:29] currency to basement we it's actually
[57:33] it's really funny that you mention the
[57:35] restaurant example because there's an
[57:36] app I don't know if it's also available
[57:38] in America but it's uh I use it in
[57:41] Austria it's called neot taste and uh
[57:44] you can um you you have deals from
[57:49] restaurants and you basically get
[57:51] usually like 50% 40% 60% sometimes off
[57:55] like you save literally like $3 $40
[57:58] sometimes on a visit in a restaurant uh
[58:01] which is amazing and uh those
[58:04] restaurants are actually really good
[58:06] like it's not like crappy restaurants or
[58:08] like only new restaurants like really
[58:10] good restaurants what what part of
[58:12] Austria are you from uh Vienna you're in
[58:14] Vienna okay I'm I'm I'm originally not
[58:17] from Vienna but now I I currently live
[58:18] in Vienna uh and and this really cool
[58:21] because uh you go there uh you you you
[58:24] just pull out pull it app out and you
[58:27] show it to the waitress and they like oh
[58:29] like cool okay you you get 50% off your
[58:32] invoice and and I didn't knew about that
[58:34] before uh and and this is already
[58:37] happening like this gamifying things
[58:40] also um there are uh apps like there are
[58:43] portals where you can do the insurances
[58:46] and stuff like that and if you have an
[58:48] insurance you get like 500 points if you
[58:51] make it with them and then you can use
[58:53] those 500 points to get a cheaper
[58:56] phone contract and stuff like that there
[58:58] like there are portals where real
[59:00] companies and normal insurance companies
[59:02] are behind but if you use that portal
[59:05] and get in like you get Reward Points
[59:08] like those systems are uh like at least
[59:11] for me already very available and the
[59:14] restaurant thing is kind of blew my mind
[59:16] because like all of the sudden it's like
[59:18] I I only go there like I I I literally
[59:20] half my expenses for restaurant because
[59:23] now I only go to restaurants that accept
[59:25] that app
[59:26] uh where I get 50% off and it's always a
[59:29] really good deal like nice food and it
[59:31] also forces me to go to new restaurants
[59:34] which is amazing thing to do also you
[59:36] you can Robin you can take that to the
[59:38] next level and you can see how you can
[59:41] gamify all kinds of stuff like in the
[59:44] insurance industry you know you can
[59:47] start to gamify behaviors that reduce
[59:50] risk
[59:51] management that improve the underwriting
[59:54] capabilities so that
[59:56] uh I can give you a lower premium so in
[59:59] the US they they do this there's a
[60:02] company called telematics and they use
[60:05] um a device on your car and it monitors
[60:08] how you're driving your
[60:10] car and where you park it and how fast
[60:12] you're going and all the Telemetry from
[60:15] the car uh and it gives you a a red
[60:20] yellow green light while you're driving
[60:22] so if you're doing something that's not
[60:24] good you get the red light and it you
[60:26] know to slow down or not break so hard
[60:28] or whatever and uh anyway so you gamify
[60:31] it and you make it the choice of the
[60:33] user you want to get a discount on your
[60:35] insurance make sure that light's green
[60:37] and at the end of the month you get a
[60:39] lot of green time you get a lot of green
[60:40] dollars back you get the money back and
[60:43] you gamify but these these are all
[60:46] Technologies you asked before about what
[60:48] happens with trafy I think you're going
[60:49] to see tremendous
[60:51] Innovation uh and things like this that
[60:54] are going to incorporate techn techology
[60:57] they're going to incorporate Bitcoin and
[60:58] the Bitcoin ethos into that Innovation
[61:00] for traditional trafi products and and
[61:03] going to create tremendous opportunities
[61:05] for people uh to not only live better
[61:07] lives but to uh if if they're interested
[61:10] in this to pursue working with companies
[61:13] to help make it happen I mean there's a
[61:14] a lot of job opportunities here for
[61:16] people if they're willing to study and
[61:18] go do this yeah so interesting to to see
[61:21] all those things happening all at once
[61:23] um they really cool um that that that
[61:27] there so so much so many different
[61:29] things to to go into that um but maybe
[61:32] uh one thing that we kind of touch on a
[61:34] little bit um but what do you think is
[61:37] the impact of eii in in in Bitcoin as
[61:40] kind of a last topic um I I think you'll
[61:43] see a uh a con convergence a little bit
[61:46] of the AI technology and
[61:50] broadly uh the Bitcoin ecosystem and I
[61:53] include you know tokenization and level
[61:56] two stuff uh the AI is going to a couple
[62:00] things one help make it happen but two
[62:02] help operate systems that give uh
[62:05] consumers uh the ability to manage these
[62:08] systems that can be somewhat complicated
[62:10] right and help them uh again optimize
[62:12] their life imagine you had uh use your
[62:16] your restaurant application now take
[62:18] that to the next level and now I have an
[62:20] AI that sits on my phone that is trained
[62:23] on me that's a personal
[62:26] llm and it tells
[62:29] me gives me options on what I should or
[62:32] could couldn't do for if I want to go
[62:34] out to dinner tonight oh we going to go
[62:36] out if you go here and summarizes and it
[62:38] knows my preferences so it's going to
[62:41] optimize things so you're going to see
[62:42] the AI become I think a very powerful
[62:45] tool now there's a dystopian world that
[62:47] people say oh the AI is going to control
[62:49] us and manipulate us and uh I think
[62:53] that's possible but technology is di
[62:55] agnostic it's either going to be there's
[62:57] certainly dystopian outcomes but there's
[63:00] also utopian outcomes and and you
[63:02] control some of that by taking control
[63:05] of it so I use technology in my life all
[63:08] the time uh and uh I find it to be very
[63:12] useful I can see how it could be
[63:14] dystopian if you let it get out of
[63:16] control for sure but uh so I see a
[63:19] tremendous amount of convergence and
[63:21] changing it's going to affect the
[63:23] Innovation it's going to affect the end
[63:25] product of what we're doing and uh it's
[63:28] something I spent a lot of time studying
[63:30] and uh and I find the AI tools to be
[63:32] extremely useful to help explain things
[63:36] uh so when even in the Bitcoin world in
[63:38] the crypto world I can't think it's more
[63:41] than the day or two goes by somebody
[63:42] will say something I don't I don't I
[63:45] don't understand what they're saying I
[63:46] don't I don't I you know it happens a
[63:48] lot so I just type it out and I go on AI
[63:51] and it tells me uh how that's going to
[63:54] work what does that mean
[63:56] um and it's been a very good useful tool
[63:58] for that so do do I assume you use the
[64:01] AI stuff as well I mean it's it's got to
[64:03] be man I use it on a I'm I'm depending
[64:07] on AI honestly like um if you take away
[64:11] AI from my life I wouldn't be able to do
[64:14] the podcast right now like I I do it
[64:17] daily I only have one part-time helper
[64:21] um and we couldn't do this podcast in a
[64:25] way
[64:26] that we do it right now without AI I I
[64:28] use it for now almost everything and
[64:31] it's so good now um I recently got a
[64:35] long email from from a podcast
[64:37] subscriber and I usually like read them
[64:39] and then then respond to that uh and and
[64:42] just for fun I was like okay let's yeah
[64:44] I already know some stuff of me like jbd
[64:46] I was like let let's put that in there
[64:49] and ask like hey like you know me I'm a
[64:52] public figure you you can see my YouTube
[64:54] videos and things written about me what
[64:57] do you think I would say back to that uh
[65:01] that viewer that wrote me that message
[65:03] and I was blown
[65:05] away like it it was there were like it
[65:09] was like such a long message on email
[65:11] and there were like two three sentences
[65:13] that I changed uh but it was so good
[65:17] that I was like if someone's on the
[65:18] other side they don't know if that was
[65:20] written by AI or by me H and I use it
[65:24] now for everything where traditionally
[65:28] entrepreneurs would hire an assistant
[65:30] for of like oh like how can I do that
[65:34] can you research that can you make that
[65:36] table like I don't use Axel anymore I
[65:39] used Axel and Google Sheets a lot now I
[65:41] just like hey here's data um can you
[65:45] please process that data for me oh like
[65:48] that's great make an ex sheet out of it
[65:50] copy bait like I have it a few years ago
[65:53] I would have made uh maybe
[65:56] python script I can now script python I
[65:59] didn't didn't never do that before but I
[66:01] had to use it um uh for a small project
[66:05] of mine and I was just doing it with
[66:07] chbd I never did it before but the CBD
[66:10] teach me and it actually worked out and
[66:12] I was blown away by it it's it's amazing
[66:15] how I I I used to run a podcast series I
[66:18] had two shows back in
[66:20] 2019 and I have a full studio with
[66:23] cameras and I had an engine doing all
[66:27] the uh the setup we would run um uh we
[66:31] had four video feeds and I think eight
[66:33] audio feeds in a studio so they would
[66:36] sync it all up and then they would do
[66:37] all the post- production work and you
[66:40] know now that work is so much easier
[66:43] five six years later and think about how
[66:45] much easier it'll be uh in a just a few
[66:48] short more years the the the tools that
[66:50] are going to be available to do uh post-
[66:53] production work production work
[66:56] and Publishing that's that's another
[66:58] thing is how you publish it through uh
[67:00] various uh various portals whether it be
[67:02] YouTube RSS feeds Spotify Etc how you
[67:05] get that out there uh and then the
[67:08] ability to do what you did is is that
[67:10] interaction the personal interaction I
[67:12] did a speech uh on Wall Street this past
[67:15] year where I was talking to uh some
[67:18] technology interns uh at one of the
[67:21] investment Banks and it was on the it
[67:24] was on AI I was talking about and um at
[67:28] the end I said listen you know I uh I
[67:31] cloned
[67:33] myself uh
[67:35] digitally and it's it was a voice clone
[67:38] and I and and the voice clone mimicked
[67:40] my voice and intonation but it also had
[67:44] a a very rudimentary personality type of
[67:46] me so I said hey let's get an question
[67:49] from the audience and let's see how my
[67:51] avatar answers it and uh it sounded just
[67:55] like me and played it back and people uh
[67:58] people were they were like wow that's
[68:00] and I said listen I only spent five
[68:02] minutes on this clone it's not like uh
[68:04] now imagine I did a an industrial grade
[68:07] clone I played it for my kids and they
[68:09] were a little freaked out by it it was
[68:11] uh now take that to the next
[68:13] level you right now I'm talking to Robin
[68:17] and and and you're sitting there but how
[68:20] far are we
[68:21] from you're at the you're out skiing and
[68:25] you took a trip to Kit spool and uh and
[68:30] your avatar is sitting there in your
[68:32] voice and your style and your
[68:34] personality having the
[68:36] conversation all the work gets done
[68:39] recording post- production ready to go
[68:42] and then on your train ride back from
[68:45] kidpool to Vienna you're watching the
[68:47] podcast yeah that looks perfect great
[68:49] son and then maybe it's already Happ
[68:51] then you send me you send me an email
[68:54] Say Hey I just let you know you know
[68:55] that wasn't me that was my uh that was
[68:58] my avatar and I said Robin I I gotta
[69:00] confess that wasn't me either that was
[69:01] my avatar and so uh the podcast was my
[69:05] avatar and your avatar talking now how
[69:09] how far are we away from that less than
[69:12] five years it's it's it's crazy to think
[69:15] about it's actually it it um I thought
[69:18] about that a lot because of like okay if
[69:20] if it's so easy to make a podcast out
[69:23] there and like just do something like H
[69:26] how is the future of because we we we
[69:30] like to watch movies we like to watch
[69:32] those things and um in in the beginning
[69:36] people even said like oh like who would
[69:38] watch an animated movie it's not real
[69:40] people but now we have animated movies
[69:43] with just real people and and you don't
[69:45] even know the difference there will be
[69:47] video games that where you can be a
[69:51] character and everyone has a whole
[69:55] different experience playing that same
[69:57] game because as you walk into that video
[70:01] game the AI will create the video game
[70:03] for you like weird things will happen
[70:07] from Ai and I'm already looking for like
[70:10] I don't know GTA AI where you have the
[70:14] the GTA six experience that will
[70:18] probably come out this year uh but it's
[70:20] all AI generated and uh how you play the
[70:23] game is depending on on how you input
[70:26] the game uh but also content creation uh
[70:29] it's already changed the game a lot with
[70:31] like it it made it so much easier for
[70:33] creators uh to put out content maybe it
[70:37] gets to the point easy where uh you you
[70:40] you really just have to assemble the
[70:43] right uh structures and figure out what
[70:46] people want to watch and you can just uh
[70:49] sit in your underwear on Sunday and and
[70:52] and and type it in or like talk it in
[70:54] into chat
[70:55] and it does all the rest on the other
[70:57] side um I think we're not there this
[71:00] year but in five years it's it's
[71:02] imaginable it's look the the the series
[71:06] uh uh on Netflix called Black Mirror uh
[71:10] lays out many of these scenarios where
[71:13] the technology moves so fast and which
[71:16] what I find interesting about that
[71:17] series is obviously the technolog is
[71:20] pretty cool but what we find very
[71:22] quickly is that our society our rules
[71:24] around economics politics legal systems
[71:27] social norms are not set up for this um
[71:32] rapid technology advancement so would
[71:34] people find offense would they be
[71:37] offended
[71:38] personally if your
[71:41] AI Avatar answered the phone and had a
[71:44] conversation with them without their
[71:46] consent I don't know maybe they would
[71:49] it's it's all
[71:51] like because people like people like
[71:55] PE people always love the the idea of
[71:59] that as a real person that's why on
[72:01] social media uh channels that are
[72:04] personal brands are performing way
[72:07] better than company brands um but what
[72:10] if AI is so good that it is like a
[72:13] person and there's no person needed to
[72:16] run that podcast it it's it's possible
[72:20] and it's especially if the podcast is
[72:22] not in person right you don't know who
[72:24] who I'm really maybe I have some
[72:26] Advanced Ai and uh put them out every
[72:29] day 100% it's it's not unimaginable
[72:32] behind me I have this the cardboard
[72:34] cutout is a book I wrote uh about six
[72:37] years ago basically about AI replacing
[72:41] um knowledge workers and the book is a
[72:45] little early right I mean I made
[72:48] predictions that are happening now but
[72:50] didn't happen as fast as I thought they
[72:52] would um and it's interesting I I I
[72:55] wrote the book with mainstream in mind
[72:58] it it's not overly Technical and it lays
[73:00] out some of these things so uh when I
[73:02] wrote the book at my my mother was my
[73:05] the audience I didn't want to write
[73:06] something that she wouldn't understand
[73:08] uh so I use a lot of stories and and
[73:11] less about the mechanics of the
[73:13] technology but more about the
[73:15] implications and what happens as a
[73:17] result what are the outcomes so
[73:19] conversation my dad passed away three
[73:22] years ago and so my mom lives by herself
[73:25] now and now she's an assisted living and
[73:28] she's lonely I mean she was married to
[73:30] my dad for close to 68 years or
[73:34] something like that so now she's lonely
[73:37] and um so I said to her I said listen um
[73:41] if we could create an avatar my dad was
[73:44] a kind of a public figure so there's a
[73:45] lot of digital uh video and audio of him
[73:50] so I would say mom if we could create a
[73:53] um a Avatar
[73:57] dad um would you want to talk to it and
[74:01] I said
[74:03] understand what it would be it would be
[74:06] his voice his
[74:08] personality and what would happen is it
[74:11] would
[74:12] remember and you would build a
[74:14] relationship with this
[74:16] technology from that point forward
[74:18] because it would remember things you're
[74:19] talking about now and issues you're
[74:21] dealing with and
[74:24] uh we would do the best we could to have
[74:26] it remember all the old memories but it
[74:28] wouldn't be as much as you might think
[74:30] and that this would be your opportunity
[74:32] to tell it all the old
[74:34] stories I said would you want to do
[74:37] that understanding the implication is
[74:41] that uh it's going to be different and
[74:44] she said yeah I think I would do that I
[74:47] mean she understood that it's not a it's
[74:50] a moral
[74:52] dilemma because the Avatar is at some
[74:55] level you're you're almost stepping on
[74:58] the memory of somebody by creating
[75:00] something new but it's
[75:02] overwhelmed that moral dilemma is
[75:04] overwhelmed by her loneliness and she
[75:06] would do it now how many people in
[75:08] society would recreate an abitar of a
[75:11] Lost Child sibling
[75:15] spouse grandfather how many people would
[75:18] want to have a relationship with a
[75:19] public figure from history or they want
[75:23] to talk and then what is the societal
[75:26] implication of somebody getting lost in
[75:29] that artificial World these are
[75:30] interesting things to think about
[75:32] because it's gonna here's the thing
[75:34] Robin it's G to come it's it's going to
[75:37] come faster than we think with or
[75:40] without our
[75:41] consent so we should start thinking
[75:43] about it now before it manifests so we
[75:45] can have sober conversations about it Ai
[75:48] and Bitcoin is really interesting
[75:49] because I think both are completely in
[75:51] available both will come in a rapid pace
[75:54] and both will
[75:55] surprise uh most people in a major way
[75:59] of like what's possible uh so that
[76:01] that's a I think it's also a great end
[76:03] point to to the conversation today um I
[76:06] have one question to I ask each and
[76:07] every one of my guests and the question
[76:08] is what can we learn from you besides
[76:10] Bitcoin uh I would say so for the most
[76:13] part like the people who know me I'm I'm
[76:15] more of a integrated macro person uh and
[76:19] so
[76:21] uh what I try to do is synthesize all of
[76:24] the
[76:25] change uh from Bitcoin integrate it with
[76:29] all of the change coming from AI
[76:31] integrate it from the change happening
[76:33] in
[76:34] politics and putting that into a soup
[76:37] and understanding what that soup is
[76:38] going to look like with all the change
[76:41] so we're in a world of Rapid change uh
[76:43] people getting
[76:45] overwhelmed and what I try to do is help
[76:47] people make sense of that that change
[76:50] and think it through so I would say uh
[76:55] I don't necessarily have all the right
[76:57] answers but I'm able to frame the right
[76:59] questions so that we can have coherent
[77:03] conversations about what the future
[77:05] holds that's an amazing way to look at
[77:07] it really cool I love
[77:10] that really cool perfect then uh we have
[77:12] a endine in the podcast where the
[77:16] previous guest is asking a question for
[77:18] the next guest without knowing who the
[77:19] next guest actually is and the previous
[77:21] guest asked you the question is there
[77:24] anyone you learned from on your Bitcoin
[77:27] Journey that really accelerated your
[77:29] understanding if so who and what was the
[77:32] material there's a there's a guy that
[77:34] I'm following right now um he's an ex
[77:38] options Trader named Josh
[77:40] Mandel um and I become friends with him
[77:44] and he he has um you know shown me some
[77:48] real inside baseball stuff on how the
[77:50] options world is working and to to the
[77:54] point where I realized there's there's a
[77:55] lot going on behind the scenes and so
[77:58] it's it's helped me understand the
[78:00] mechanics of the market a little bit
[78:01] more I was generally familiar with it
[78:03] but he would be one that that recently
[78:05] has been helping me a lot another guy is
[78:08] Joe caros Sally uh careri is a he's an
[78:12] attorney out of Chicago um very smart
[78:15] guy he's constantly challenging me in
[78:18] the thinking that I have this saying oh
[78:20] you're you're you're you're simp too
[78:23] simplistic here that's not to work and
[78:25] so I appreciate a lot of his critical
[78:28] thinking he's very knowledgeable very
[78:29] smart guy and uh I enjoy conversations
[78:34] with uh with Joe but I'm in a couple of
[78:35] chat groups on X people can find me on
[78:38] Spaces quite a bit um and I enjoy that
[78:42] those networking opportunities and
[78:43] learning from as many people as I can
[78:45] but those two right now strike strike me
[78:47] as people who have really help me think
[78:49] through uh where my journey is on this
[78:52] whole process really cool uh perfect
[78:55] thank you so much uh Thomas for for
[78:58] taking your time and being a great guest
[79:01] today um before I let you go where can
[79:04] people find you ask your questions and
[79:06] and reach out to you best ways on on uh
[79:09] on X is to go to Tom young Jr on uh on X
[79:14] that's where I spend most of my time uh
[79:16] my company is a company called rum jog
[79:19] it's uh it's on my profile on X you can
[79:21] see that you can click and see that uh
[79:24] right now now I'm I'm doing I'm doing
[79:26] some corporate work right now on some of
[79:29] the change but mostly I'm focusing on
[79:31] some research right now uh on uh AI
[79:35] policies and and and and change
[79:37] management within corporations so it's
[79:40] uh uh I also I'm usually I told you I'm
[79:43] 61 I'm getting older so I'm focusing my
[79:45] time a little bit differently I've been
[79:47] spending a lot of time studying uh the
[79:49] Bitcoin journey and what people should
[79:52] be doing and then ultimately that would
[79:53] lead to what should be corporations be
[79:55] doing uh given all the changes that are
[79:57] coming from Ai and Bitcoin really cool
[80:00] yeah that there are a lot of changes
[80:02] coming way and and way faster than than
[80:05] we think that's very true thank you so
[80:07] much uh Thomas for for being on the show
[80:10] thank you so much also for everyone that
[80:11] is watching and listening for joining us
[80:13] today as always I'll be back tomorrow
[80:15] with another episode bye bye thanks see
[80:17] you
