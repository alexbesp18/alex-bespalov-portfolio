[00:00] yes we are going to break 200k yes we
[00:03] are going to break 300K yes we are going
[00:05] to break 1 million Talent is moving away
[00:07] from Germany moving away from Europe go
[00:10] to the US go to Central America and
[00:12] obviously they're also bringing wealth
[00:14] they are building in the education
[00:16] department a Bitcoin department and
[00:18] together with me premiera Bitcoin they
[00:20] are now enrolling a program where they
[00:22] teach 400 teachers about Bitcoin and
[00:25] then the teachers go ahead and learn the
[00:27] students about Bitcoin the more you join
[00:30] and use this protocol use this
[00:31] technology the more you benefit from it
[00:33] I don't like to be paid now in feat
[00:35] anymore we would shift our mindset from
[00:36] short-term thinking to long-term
[00:38] thinking it feels so good to buy Bitcoin
[00:41] and it feels so bad to buy anything else
[00:43] Bitcoin mining is good for countries
[00:45] Bitcoin mining is good for people
[00:47] Bitcoin mining is good for institutions
[00:50] the goal all of the sudden shifts from
[00:51] tomorrow to like next year to like the
[00:53] 10 years to 100 years out Bitcoin is
[00:55] going up and to the right forever your
[00:57] euro is going to crash your dollar is
[00:58] going to crash your yen is going to
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] crash one3 of the miners around that
[01:08] number is in America so it's it's
[01:10] impressive what they're doing and they
[01:12] didn't sleep on the internet and they're
[01:14] not sleeping on bitcoin
[01:16] either yeah and a lot of interesting
[01:18] stuff going on right now on on on nation
[01:21] state and then country level in the US
[01:23] right now so there's a lot to observe at
[01:24] the moment which is pretty exciting and
[01:26] you actually just have been to to El
[01:28] Salvador right so maybe you can you can
[01:30] talk a little bit about it the first
[01:32] impressions you had the positive stuff
[01:33] maybe some some disappointing stuff you
[01:36] experienced in El salador and and maybe
[01:38] like how was the German community over
[01:41] there or the German speaking Community
[01:42] are there already people located over
[01:44] there like tell us a little bit like
[01:46] what's going on over there first
[01:47] impression absolutely and for for people
[01:50] that might be confused now that that you
[01:53] uh asking questions because it's very
[01:55] unusual for my podcast uh we talked
[01:57] about it before uh and uh we will do the
[02:00] first part of that a little bit about El
[02:02] Salvador because I said and I promised
[02:04] that I will make a video about it and I
[02:06] just decided one minute before we
[02:08] started recording let's do this in this
[02:10] video so spontaneous as
[02:13] always we flexible uh and and then let's
[02:17] talk about nation state adoption and
[02:18] then like current things and then a
[02:20] little bit about your topics also are
[02:22] really cool that we can be flexible here
[02:25] and yeah El Salvador I was the first
[02:27] time ever in El Salvador I was never
[02:29] there first of all as an Austrian as
[02:31] someone that comes from Europe it's a
[02:33] long trip uh it took me around 24 hours
[02:36] to get there because I had to uh come
[02:40] with Canada there's no direct flight
[02:42] from from Vienna so I have to go from
[02:44] Vienna to Canada from Canada to to
[02:46] America there's layovers uh the total
[02:49] flight hours are like 14 15 hours then
[02:53] obviously you have to be previously on
[02:55] the plane you have to go from the
[02:57] airport back to the Airbnb and there's
[02:59] layover so it takes around 20 to 24
[03:03] hours from Austria to
[03:05] to it's it's a tough trip and it's like
[03:08] obviously also a long trip uh and you go
[03:11] from seven hours difference of the time
[03:14] zone so like you you start here and
[03:17] salador is seven hours behind so it's
[03:20] it's a it's it's a big difference Al in
[03:23] there but when I landed I drove actually
[03:26] with the bit driver so with the Bitcoin
[03:29] Uber
[03:30] uh to do do do my Airbnb uh which was
[03:34] amazing because you can pay him directly
[03:36] in Bitcoin there's like a lot of Bitcoin
[03:38] stickers there um but then I purposely
[03:41] decided in El Salvador I want to drive
[03:44] with Uber and not with the bit driver
[03:47] because yeah I I want to be a little bit
[03:49] outside of the Bitcoin bubble if you're
[03:51] if you're just driving with the bit
[03:52] driver to all the Bitcoin conferences
[03:55] then obviously you think thatav is the
[03:57] Bitcoin country because wanted to see
[04:00] the real asor
[04:02] to exactly yeah and so I was driving
[04:05] with Uber and was asking all the Uber
[04:08] drivers who spoke English because I
[04:10] think 50% of the Uber drivers that I
[04:13] spoke to weren't even able to speak
[04:15] English so if you consider moving to El
[04:19] Salvador um you should also consider
[04:21] that you have to learn
[04:23] Spanish it's it's hard to get there um
[04:27] across with just English you should
[04:30] learn at least like a minimum amount of
[04:32] Spanish but yeah that's that that's
[04:34] anyways wherever you move you should uh
[04:36] learn the
[04:38] language uh the local speak there and
[04:41] then it's really interesting uh when you
[04:43] get there and ask the people that speak
[04:45] English about Bitcoin first of all um
[04:48] they are positive towards it but almost
[04:52] no one had it look from those people
[04:55] that I spoke to the local peoples
[04:56] actually nobody had it nobody
[04:59] Bitcoin uh and nobody used it really the
[05:02] only thing that someone used is like the
[05:04] CH wallet and then they got the
[05:06] incentive from the government and
[05:07] converted back to US
[05:09] dollars they had some touch points
[05:11] sometimes had a che wallet but they
[05:14] didn't so so the penetration in the
[05:17] general uh population isn't that huge
[05:21] obviously it's bigger than in Austria uh
[05:24] but it's it's not like oh yeah everyone
[05:26] uses it and uh you cannot pay uh in in
[05:30] Bitcoin everywhere I try to just go
[05:34] where I want to go and not search for
[05:36] Bitcoin restaurants like I went just to
[05:38] Google and like oh here is a nice pooa
[05:41] place poo is a nice dish in in in in
[05:43] salador very delicious but very
[05:47] unhealthy I loved it a
[05:50] lot um but I'm glad it's not the here in
[05:52] AUST because I think it would eat it
[05:54] every day it's really good uh and I went
[05:57] to the
[05:59] it's it's basically a round thing and
[06:03] there's like meat inside and there's
[06:05] like some some sort of bread around it
[06:08] uh it's like it's a little bit of like a
[06:11] PR I don't know what the prad actually
[06:13] is but it's like an oil made and like
[06:16] it's very fat uh it's it's it's not that
[06:20] bad but it's uh it's very good not not
[06:24] the something I need to check out once
[06:26] I'm over there yeah and and you will
[06:29] check it out uh it's they are all over
[06:31] the place like if you go there you you
[06:34] you will see babusa places you literally
[06:36] just go around the uh around the corners
[06:39] and there like the street food uh boa
[06:41] places and there also like big
[06:43] restaurants that only sell boas with
[06:46] every different kind of um feeling
[06:49] inside so a lot of things are happening
[06:51] with with with with that and yeah with
[06:55] with that uh I would say that is kind of
[06:59] the the the the food there yeah exactly
[07:01] that's what I wanted to say with um
[07:03] Bitcoin then I wanted to try to pay with
[07:07] Bitcoin those restaurants that I just
[07:09] searched on Google and did not search
[07:11] for Bitcoin restaurants I couldn't pay
[07:13] there with with Bitcoin anywhere uh they
[07:16] sometimes they all knew what Bitcoin is
[07:18] so I think that was one um
[07:21] accomplishment of El Salvador everyone
[07:24] there knows Bitcoin Bitcoin is a is a
[07:27] word that everyone is familiar with and
[07:30] most of them also know that Bitcoin is
[07:33] already um a currency that the
[07:35] government tries to put in and most of
[07:39] them are very positive uh towards that
[07:42] and is saying like oh it's very
[07:43] Innovative the government is trying
[07:46] something very modern uh so in in that
[07:48] sense it's it has a general positive
[07:51] sense to it but I I'm not sure if they
[07:54] just pretended that because I came with
[07:56] Bitcoin t-shirts there
[07:59] so they wanted to make you feel
[08:01] comfortable they wanted to make you feel
[08:03] right at this place exactly it's just
[08:06] it's just something that you have to
[08:08] consider I'm as coming someone with a
[08:11] Bitcoin t-shirt on and they maybe just
[08:13] being being friendly there uh and that
[08:18] that's one thing that that I really like
[08:20] that's something that I was surprised
[08:22] that the adoption is not as far as a
[08:26] thought uh I couldn't pay any anywh just
[08:29] to Bitcoin so I had to really search for
[08:32] places to pay with Bitcoin um and not
[08:35] just go on Google and like ah let let's
[08:36] go there and I can pay with Bitcoin
[08:39] there it was not like that even I I went
[08:41] up to the S Salvador volcano and there
[08:44] you had to pay with cash so you could
[08:46] not pay with card or with Bitcoin I
[08:49] didn't had US dollar cash with me I only
[08:51] had Euros cash or US dollar in credit
[08:54] card form with me uh so I just couldn't
[08:58] pay for the entry fee
[09:00] even though they're using their
[09:01] volcanoes to mine Bitcoin right so this
[09:05] this shows us how long it takes to
[09:07] basically adopt a Bitcoin standard I
[09:08] mean right they they introduced it like
[09:10] 21 so they are now ahead like three
[09:13] years compared to other states or
[09:15] countries that might jump on but this is
[09:18] like the the early
[09:19] pioneering Advantage they have now like
[09:21] this this three years clearly show us it
[09:24] it still needs time it it's a process of
[09:26] years to fully adopt a Bitcoin standard
[09:29] and I think this is this is so
[09:31] interesting to observe that even they
[09:33] announced it in 21 and even though we
[09:35] clearly see the success as of now for
[09:38] those three years it really takes time
[09:40] to to bring this into a
[09:43] country and it also shows us that El
[09:46] Salvador is is doing the
[09:50] Strategic is doing it very strategically
[09:54] but not pressing it on the people
[09:57] because asor could also just force with
[10:00] very forceful laws every Merchant to
[10:03] accept it they could do that they could
[10:06] literally go from now they can just
[10:08] choose what to
[10:09] use exactly and and it's like they could
[10:13] make like very forceful laws and they
[10:15] could like randomly go to Merchants and
[10:17] say like oh do you accept Bitcoin or you
[10:19] don't accept Bitcoin you have to pay our
[10:21] fine for that so like they could do a
[10:24] lot of things uh in order to enforce it
[10:27] but they choose not to do it they try
[10:29] try to keep it uh friendly and I think
[10:32] that's very nice uh what they're doing
[10:34] but at the same time they're building uh
[10:37] in the education department a Bitcoin
[10:40] department and uh together with me
[10:42] Premier Bitcoin they now um enrolling a
[10:45] program where they teach 400 teachers
[10:49] about Bitcoin and then the teachers go
[10:51] ahead and learn the students about
[10:53] Bitcoin this is just a starting of the
[10:55] of of all those programs so they really
[10:57] try with with incentives uh and with
[11:01] education to go in there and not with
[11:03] forceful loss which I think is a very
[11:06] very positive sign super interesting
[11:09] thanks for
[11:09] sharing absolutely yeah and so overall I
[11:13] have to say everyone is extremely
[11:14] hopeful about El Salvador everyone is
[11:17] extremely um yeah positive towards the
[11:21] this this brain train uh that happens
[11:25] like the people the best talent of El
[11:26] Salvador moved to America to Spain to
[11:30] Europe to wherever this stopped now
[11:32] actually the people are staying in
[11:35] Salvador and want to build something in
[11:36] Salvador and even the even the opposite
[11:39] is now happening where people that moved
[11:42] out are coming back and we see now not
[11:46] only the people that moved out that are
[11:47] coming back but also talent that is from
[11:52] somewhere else like Europe America
[11:54] they're coming to Saad
[11:57] especially I see a lot lot of experts
[12:00] now going to El Salvador and I think
[12:03] this is quite interesting because this
[12:04] wouldn't be the first country in my head
[12:07] or in my list as an expert to relocate
[12:10] or to move to but this clearly shows
[12:12] that this emerging technology is
[12:15] attracting both the right talent and
[12:18] wealth and pulling it into countries who
[12:22] adopt to a legal friendly Bitcoin
[12:26] standard it's it's it's amazing to
[12:28] observe and and obviously I talk to a
[12:30] lot of German speaking people and and I
[12:33] see them relocating over there I see
[12:35] them moving over there so they Talent is
[12:38] moving away from Germany moving away
[12:40] from Europe go to the US go to Central
[12:44] America and obviously they're also
[12:45] bringing wealth and that's that's just a
[12:48] wealth transfer happening right in front
[12:49] of my eyes and I think it's just very
[12:52] interesting I am very glad that my
[12:56] income is not depending on Europe my
[12:59] income is just uh all over the world and
[13:03] I can just relocate wh I want so I'm
[13:05] really glad about that fact uh that that
[13:09] I'm not working in a European company
[13:11] that is uh riing on the European economy
[13:15] because we see it all over Europe
[13:16] they're struggling and hopefully
[13:18] hopefully they wake up before it's too
[13:20] late they wake up before uh something
[13:23] really breaks because uh Europe can be a
[13:27] third world country it can develop in
[13:30] that we we can decline in that I really
[13:33] don't hope that because Europe has an
[13:35] amazing culture amazing countries
[13:37] amazing Landscapes and it would be a
[13:40] shame if that happens uh in in in in
[13:43] that regard so I really hope that Europe
[13:46] gets gets it at some point and I have a
[13:49] lot of Hope for that because I see the
[13:51] the political parties that are uh
[13:54] against cbdcs the political party that
[13:56] against the digital Service Act and the
[13:58] European
[14:00] things they are becoming stronger and
[14:03] stronger in whole of Europe with all the
[14:06] elections that we see coming up so I
[14:09] have a lot of Hope actually for for
[14:11] Europe but it's a long it's a long way
[14:13] to go and uh Central America is kind of
[14:16] catching up to Europe and America is
[14:20] completely going further than
[14:23] Europe what what are your thoughts so
[14:26] far Europe basically no I I really like
[14:30] and enjoy the fact that you decided to
[14:32] live on a Bitcoin standard as much as
[14:34] possible for yourself so obviously you
[14:36] get your salary as much as possible in
[14:38] Bitcoin you're you're trying to to use
[14:40] this technology as much as possible and
[14:43] and and this is exactly what I do as
[14:45] best and as much as possible here here
[14:47] in Germany I I started to adopt a
[14:49] Bitcoin standard basically for both like
[14:51] me on our private side and for from my
[14:53] business side through my Foundation to
[14:56] adopt a Bitcoin standard and to live on
[14:58] a Bitcoin standard as much as possible
[15:00] in in Germany and I'd be curious to hear
[15:02] like how is this going for you in
[15:04] Austria what are maybe the the
[15:06] challenges you currently face and and
[15:09] what are the advantages you you have
[15:10] compared to your peers that that are
[15:13] still still basically living in a in a
[15:15] Fiat
[15:17] standard it's it's interesting because
[15:20] uh when when you live on quote unquote
[15:23] Bitcoin standard right now I still
[15:25] manage to not needing to sell my Bitcoin
[15:29] or borrow against my Bitcoin I don't
[15:31] need to do this right now because I
[15:34] still have a part of my salary in in
[15:37] Fiat and I can still pay all my bills
[15:40] with that so I'm I'm in this this lucky
[15:42] situation where all the income that I
[15:45] have in Bitcoin I don't need for pay
[15:48] paying my bills and all the feed income
[15:50] that I cannot convert uh to to bitcoin
[15:53] right now for example I have a merch
[15:55] store there I get paid in feed I cannot
[15:58] change that I have my YouTube ad Revenue
[16:01] I get paid in I cannot change that and
[16:03] one of my sponsors I also asked them to
[16:06] pay me in Fiat so I can pay my Fiat
[16:09] bills um and and that's why why I can do
[16:14] with just my two3 of my sponsors I get
[16:18] paid in Bitcoin I keep that money um it
[16:21] will be really interesting to see how
[16:23] this develops because honestly I don't
[16:25] like to be paid now in feat anymore so
[16:27] probably will also con the third sponsor
[16:30] do say like hey please now pay me
[16:32] Bitcoin uh and uh obviously I will
[16:35] probably not convert YouTube or Google
[16:39] don't pay me in in Bitcoin anytime soon
[16:42] this is a higher challenge um so right
[16:45] now I don't struggle with that because I
[16:46] pay everything in in in Fiat and I still
[16:50] have the bank account still do that um
[16:52] but I would love for it not to be that
[16:55] way and there are a lot of interesting
[16:58] Concepts out there like just sell your
[17:00] Bitcoin uh convert it to feat and then
[17:03] pay with that or you can borrow against
[17:06] your Bitcoin uh there are companies with
[17:08] Firefish lerat and stuff like that where
[17:11] you can do that uh you can even go to a
[17:13] Traditional Bank they're also doing that
[17:16] uh in in Austria and Germany where say
[17:18] like okay I I have this amount of
[17:19] Bitcoin I I want to keep it in myself
[17:22] custody but this is my security how much
[17:25] of a loan are you giving me these are
[17:27] all possibilities um but uh it's there's
[17:32] nothing perfect I would just love to
[17:34] have uh a Bitcoin wallet and spend from
[17:38] that Bitcoin wallet that that would be
[17:40] the dream come true but there is there
[17:42] are taxes involved in that there is like
[17:45] documentation involved in that uh it's
[17:48] it's not it's not perfect how did you
[17:50] manage uh to to do
[17:53] that honestly speaking yes it is a
[17:56] challenge I mean obviously in in
[17:59] countries like Austria and Germany you
[18:01] cannot fully adopt a Bitcoin standard
[18:03] just just yet the the way I do it um
[18:06] obviously I get paid both Bitcoin and
[18:10] Fiat through my foundation and I also do
[18:13] um have my own Bitcoin mining operation
[18:16] so obviously I I pay myself in in both
[18:19] Fiat and Bitcoin depending on the needs
[18:21] I have I really try to live on a
[18:25] minimalism style as as much as possible
[18:28] I just feel like the moment you realize
[18:30] you have you have an appreciating asset
[18:33] versus depreciating assets you you
[18:36] constantly try to look for ways to to
[18:39] just live very simple very clean and
[18:41] just to to turn as little Bitcoin as as
[18:45] possible in in fact I actually I just
[18:47] sold my seven seater car like I had this
[18:49] huge seven seater SUV car and I felt
[18:53] like this car is standing right there
[18:56] burning money basically every single
[18:58] second every single minute and it kind
[19:01] of didn't feel right for me so so I'm a
[19:04] person who likes to live on a very low
[19:07] minimalism style and and this is what I
[19:10] do this is what I enjoy so so I try to
[19:12] convert as as little Bitcoin as possible
[19:15] and obviously there are platform there
[19:16] are apps out there who who make this
[19:18] possible but yes I have to work very
[19:21] very close closely with my tax Strate
[19:24] strategy consultant here in Germany i b
[19:28] Bally had to Outsource my tax part
[19:30] because it just was way too complicated
[19:33] and so I have this in professional hands
[19:35] and and this person is is is handling
[19:37] everything through my and with my
[19:40] Foundation it works I really enjoy the
[19:42] the benefits obviously since my
[19:44] purchasing power constantly increases
[19:46] month over month and I see my peers um
[19:49] around me complaining about Rising Pizza
[19:51] prices around Rising Barber prices
[19:54] around Rising renting prices and and
[19:57] obviously when when you when you secure
[19:59] yourself in in Bitcoin then obviously
[20:02] you start measuring you start thinking
[20:04] even even in Bitcoin terms and not in
[20:06] fear terms anymore and then prices for
[20:09] you get get more cheaper so this is the
[20:11] advantage I enjoy and this is why I keep
[20:13] keep living on the standard as much and
[20:15] as best as possible and after the first
[20:18] couple of months and everything was
[20:19] settled and I had everything in place
[20:21] since then it's actually really fun to
[20:23] be honest I really enjoy living on the
[20:25] standard and I would highly recommend
[20:27] everyone doing it or give it a try it's
[20:29] fun it's it's benefiting um the more you
[20:33] you join and and and use this protocol
[20:35] use this te technology the more you
[20:37] benefit from it and so this is why my
[20:40] mission and vision is to to keep using
[20:42] it as as much as
[20:44] possible but but are you paying in in
[20:47] Bitcoin I'm basically using apps that
[20:50] that that convert my Bitcoin into FEI
[20:52] the moment I pay and um sometimes I'm
[20:55] using platforms when I also know okay
[20:57] have a bigger purchase and I need a
[20:59] couple of hundred bucks or whatever then
[21:01] I basically convert my Bitcoin and then
[21:03] I pay with the Fiat but I basically
[21:05] converted at the latest stage sometimes
[21:07] I'm at the grocery store I know I need
[21:09] like 30 bucks for this for this purchase
[21:12] so I convert like 30 bucks in Bitcoin
[21:14] into field and then I pay my bill that's
[21:16] why you need a tax
[21:18] professional right that's that's why I
[21:20] need a tax professional because this is
[21:22] a long a long list of
[21:24] transactions and this needs to be
[21:26] published on a monthly basis and
[21:28] everything is done through my tax
[21:29] consultant and he takes care of
[21:30] everything but if you do this then you
[21:33] really need to have
[21:35] professional a professional consultant
[21:37] right next to you in in order to make
[21:39] this properly and to make this
[21:41] right yeah I guess so be I mean uh in
[21:45] Germany the the rule is also that you
[21:47] can hold it one year and then it's
[21:50] taxfree uh and I think it's also first
[21:52] in first out so if you have it for a
[21:55] long time uh you can spend like your
[21:58] first Bitcoins that's actually in
[22:00] Austria it was also true in Austria if
[22:02] you hold it like longer than one year
[22:04] and then it's taxfree it's since I think
[22:06] February 2021 not true anymore but I
[22:10] bought um uh a big part of my Bitcoin
[22:14] before February 2021 so actually um I
[22:19] never sold any but if I start to sell
[22:22] Bitcoin I actually could uh sell it
[22:25] taxfree I don't know exactly how big
[22:28] that parties uh but yeah a good amount
[22:31] of of my Bitcoin is actually uh taxfree
[22:35] even in in Austria so selling would be
[22:38] quite quite good actually in the in the
[22:40] starting but I just I just don't want to
[22:43] sell Bitcoin at the moment it feels so
[22:44] much better to spend Fiat I feel exactly
[22:47] the same and I was wondering like how do
[22:49] you actually how do you handle this
[22:52] feeling like it can be tough knowing
[22:55] that paying my $3 or my 3 coffee with
[22:59] Bitcoin now actually costs me at some
[23:02] point maybe even a car like how knowing
[23:06] all this how do you manage your feelings
[23:09] to to actually live life and to keep
[23:12] enjoying things without always
[23:14] struggling like ah I don't want to get
[23:16] rid of my Bitcoin I actually need more
[23:18] of it you you constantly have the
[23:20] feeling you don't have enough Bitcoin
[23:21] right so how do you manage the feeling I
[23:24] think that's a uh an extremely
[23:26] interesting route because
[23:28] uh when you have fear all of the sudden
[23:31] you're incentivized to spend uh as much
[23:34] as possible you're incentivized to also
[23:36] spend on things that you might not
[23:38] necessarily 100% need but with Bitcoin
[23:42] you're like hey wait um if if I don't
[23:45] spend it now um I get more uh from from
[23:50] it because if if I am now in Bitcoin I'm
[23:53] like oh if I spend it today I sell
[23:55] Bitcoin at like 97,000 which is amazing
[23:58] but maybe if I spend the same amount
[24:01] next year I maybe uh sell my Bitcoin at
[24:05] like 250,000 I don't know that could
[24:08] happen for next year um
[24:11] but so this is then making the case for
[24:14] you to maybe holding off on that
[24:17] purchase that you wanted and this is
[24:19] this holding off period can only take so
[24:22] long if you if for example if your
[24:24] family of six people you probably need
[24:27] that SUV you would not sell it if you
[24:29] have a family with six people because
[24:31] you have to get from A to B maybe you
[24:34] would downgrade to another car but you
[24:37] you need this car so you cannot hold off
[24:39] of that uh you also have to buy food for
[24:43] yourself so you cannot save on on food
[24:46] and just not eat because you die and
[24:48] then your Bitcoin is also not worth
[24:50] anything so so there are things you need
[24:53] and you will buy them and there are
[24:54] things you love and you buy them and
[24:56] that's okay but the third bucket that
[25:00] things that I want to impress someone
[25:02] else with things that uh I really don't
[25:06] need but I just bought them anyways and
[25:08] those kind of things those Fall Away
[25:10] with Bitcoin because all of the sudden
[25:12] you're thinking like do I really need
[25:14] that and there's something funny
[25:17] happening with me right now there's two
[25:19] things there's the first thing is like
[25:21] whenever I spend I'm like I could put
[25:23] this in Bitcoin like I could do that in
[25:26] Bitcoin the second thing opportunity
[25:28] costs for yourself with every single
[25:31] purchase absolutely and and it's not
[25:34] something I don't know if if it's for
[25:36] you maybe in that way but it's not
[25:37] something I calculate like oh if I sell
[25:40] this now it would be like 2x for two
[25:42] years from now it's not like an an
[25:44] actual calculation in my head it's just
[25:46] a feeling where I'm like I could have
[25:48] bought Bitcoin with that it feels so
[25:51] good to buy Bitcoin and it feels so bad
[25:54] to buy anything else and uh it's
[25:58] I know the feeling I feel
[26:00] you and I didn't get my girlfriend till
[26:03] now to this point and there I see a
[26:05] different world she feels good when she
[26:07] buys something uh I I I lost the feeling
[26:12] that I feel good about buying something
[26:14] other than Bitcoin maybe that's not
[26:17] healthy that could be unhealthy I don't
[26:19] know let's see but but I completely
[26:22] forgot um I've completely lost the
[26:25] feeling of like oh wow I bought that and
[26:28] it feels so
[26:30] good it's gone away so like maybe it
[26:34] didn't didn't go away completely there
[26:36] still a good feeling when I buy
[26:38] something that makes someone else happy
[26:40] and that's also something that is really
[26:42] great to to to see if you're like oh wow
[26:45] I I bought that for example in in one
[26:47] week I make a holiday with my mom and
[26:50] with my sister and her friend with my
[26:52] girlfriend and I basically said like oh
[26:54] I'm working so much and I don't see my
[26:57] mom a lot don't see my family lot so I
[27:00] just invited all of them to come with me
[27:02] to that holiday that's awesome and this
[27:04] money I gladly spent because I spend
[27:07] them on the the people I love and this
[27:11] is under category hey do I need that no
[27:15] but I love that so that's the two things
[27:17] I want to spend my money on it's like
[27:20] things I need obviously I cannot go out
[27:23] without them I need food I need shelter
[27:24] I need the things and the other thing is
[27:26] like things I love so I don't I don't
[27:29] love paying for rent but I need to pay
[27:32] for rent but I love spending my money uh
[27:35] on on things that uh make me and other
[27:38] people around me happy and those things
[27:41] can change over time uh but it's it's
[27:43] really a good uh insight to struggle
[27:46] with that uh feeling and I I have that
[27:49] feeling all the time and yeah we are now
[27:51] right before 98k actually I just saw the
[27:54] price before
[27:56] 97.9k uh and it's it's just crazy to to
[28:00] see your purchasing power going up uh
[28:03] that that that much but this this this
[28:05] mindset this attitude Robin this is
[28:07] something I really love about Bitcoin to
[28:10] be honest speaking with with with
[28:12] bitcoiners they all have this kind of
[28:14] mindset they all have this kind of
[28:16] attitude and I feel like it's just a
[28:18] it's we seeing a a change a Minds mindi
[28:23] change and and narratives when it comes
[28:25] to wealth when it comes to time when it
[28:28] comes to how do I want to spend the time
[28:30] with with who want to do I want to spend
[28:33] the time with and what's actually
[28:35] important to me and what's actually
[28:36] important to others I feel like in a
[28:39] fear world the way we thought the way we
[28:43] took our decision was more like
[28:44] shortterm we wanted to impress people
[28:47] maybe we bought this big house or maybe
[28:48] we bought this big car which didn't make
[28:51] sense at all or maybe we we bought the
[28:53] the 12th t-shirt in in in the 15th color
[28:57] to I know to to bring this Joy within us
[29:01] like like you said you don't have this
[29:03] Joy anymore when you're spending your
[29:04] your field and with Bitcoin this this
[29:07] narrative this mindset mind mindset
[29:10] shifts totally and it rewards different
[29:14] incentives and it rewards long-term
[29:16] thinking and this is what I really like
[29:18] and enjoy to observe because I feel like
[29:22] imagine this on all levels across all
[29:24] Industries we would shift our mindset
[29:27] from long-term thinking from short-term
[29:29] thinking to long-term
[29:31] thinking would we as human beings or the
[29:34] population would we make better
[29:36] decisions on all levels across all
[29:39] Industries and this is what I think we
[29:42] observe in different Industries already
[29:44] and I think this is what we are going to
[29:45] see going
[29:47] forward and it's amazing to see that the
[29:50] Bitcoin Community uh is is the the
[29:53] leader in that right now and and you can
[29:55] see that if you're at Bitcoin
[29:57] conferences you can see that if you
[29:59] interact with people this low time
[30:01] preference this long-term thinking um
[30:04] it's it's amazing to see for me the
[30:07] Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin
[30:08] Community is such an important part uh
[30:10] for me in in in Bitcoin which brings me
[30:14] to one question that I really wanted to
[30:15] ask you because I think might have a
[30:17] unique answer to that what is for you
[30:19] the like the most
[30:21] important piece or part in the Bitcoin
[30:25] community in Bitcoin like what what is
[30:27] the like the one thing that you're like
[30:29] oh should like that that's that's so
[30:30] Central and that's so important for the
[30:32] Bitcoin
[30:35] Community that's a good question and to
[30:37] be honest um I have a I have a
[30:40] background from Tech sales so obviously
[30:42] before I jumped right into the big
[30:44] Bitcoin technology maybe to give you a
[30:46] little background like like I started
[30:47] investing in
[30:49] 2017 but obviously by that time I I had
[30:51] no clue at all about Bitcoin I was just
[30:54] living in the US I had American friends
[30:55] there were some some OG pioneers so
[30:58] salute to them thanks to them they
[31:00] brought me into Bitcoin I had no clue I
[31:02] was just an investor throwing in money
[31:04] in real estate and and and and shares so
[31:07] okay this emerging asset class I'll give
[31:09] it a try throw in some
[31:11] money but I didn't understand anything
[31:14] about this technology and what it
[31:15] actually can do for human beings for
[31:17] this community for all of the people but
[31:20] obviously after comparing over the years
[31:22] those different asset classes I clearly
[31:24] noticed there's something there must be
[31:26] something special around this
[31:28] and then Co hit like in 2020 so
[31:32] everything was slowing down I was
[31:33] working in in for American um tech tech
[31:37] tech Giants basically driving software
[31:39] cells across Europe everything was
[31:41] slowing down a little bit so this was
[31:43] the time I really doubled down on on
[31:45] this technology and tried to study and
[31:47] tried to to learn Bitcoin like what is
[31:50] so powerful about it what why can it
[31:52] change the world why can it change the
[31:54] way we live and interact with each
[31:56] other and I basically fell down the
[31:58] rabbit hole and then it took me like
[32:01] like two years to fully understand and
[32:03] embrace everything and and obviously
[32:05] still learning every single day and then
[32:07] in 22 there comes there came the cut
[32:09] where all those tech tech layoffs came
[32:12] and this was HP what's happened to me as
[32:15] well so I was um one victim of of a Tex
[32:19] layoff round and this was the moment I
[32:21] doubled down and went all in this was in
[32:23] 22 so I went all in in Bitcoin and
[32:25] basically jumped from from this Tech
[32:27] sales bubble
[32:28] which is also a great Community into the
[32:31] Bitcoin community and and then I started
[32:32] to build my own Own Foundation I started
[32:34] to build my my own Bitcoin Min mining
[32:37] operation I started to to offer Bitcoin
[32:40] Consulting and education all this kind
[32:42] kind of stuff and and diving into this
[32:45] community people like you Robin look at
[32:48] you you said I'm going all in in Bitcoin
[32:51] since then you're you're doing one
[32:53] podcast every single day it's incredible
[32:58] the drive the mission the vision this
[33:00] really goes beyond a 9-to-5 job I do
[33:04] this because I get some money to to pay
[33:07] to pay my bills th this is so much more
[33:11] people who are really into this
[33:12] technology who really understand this
[33:14] technology they
[33:15] know that this protocol that that this
[33:18] network can change the way we live is
[33:22] going to change the way we live is going
[33:24] to change the way we interact how we
[33:26] spend how we see wealth how we think how
[33:30] we take decisions and I think this is
[33:33] the biggest backbone of this community
[33:35] because this drive this Vision this
[33:38] Mission you really see it everywhere and
[33:41] it pulls up an energy that that sucks
[33:43] you in and even it's like a rocket that
[33:47] puts you puts you to the moon like like
[33:50] those people always say to the moon and
[33:52] and and yes there's something in it
[33:53] because not only because of bitcoin's
[33:55] growth but actually because of the
[33:56] people behind
[33:58] building this new future together and I
[34:01] think this is the biggest part of this
[34:02] community and I think this is why why
[34:04] this community is also winning I
[34:06] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[34:10] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[34:13] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[34:15] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[34:18] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[34:21] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[34:24] go out there and show that you are a
[34:27] Bitcoin and that watch brand is Bitcoin
[34:30] only and coin vigilante just dropped a
[34:33] completely new and amazing Genesis
[34:36] edition of their watch collections you
[34:39] have the date of the first ever mined
[34:42] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[34:44] also the block height and which EPO we
[34:47] are currently in I love the level of
[34:50] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[34:53] and make sure to check out those amazing
[34:56] coin vigilante t pieces down in the
[34:59] descriptions I love those watches so so
[35:02] much if you watch or listen to my
[35:04] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[35:06] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[35:09] the most important step is to keep the
[35:12] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[35:15] wallet my personal recommendation for
[35:17] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[35:19] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[35:22] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[35:24] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[35:27] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[35:31] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[35:34] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[35:37] step is to really level up your
[35:39] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[35:42] have the most secure self custody setup
[35:45] you have to secure your own devices you
[35:48] have to protect your privacy you have to
[35:50] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:53] on where you live you even want to have
[35:56] a plan B a citizen ship where you can
[35:58] move in case something goes really
[36:00] really wrong and through all those steps
[36:02] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[36:05] step by step and if you visit the
[36:08] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[36:11] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[36:14] out how you can level up your
[36:17] sovereignty it's the proof of work uh
[36:20] aspect of it basically then like the
[36:22] proof of work the low time preference
[36:24] everything together it's like you you
[36:26] want to all of the sudden get more
[36:28] Bitcoin so you put your proof of work in
[36:30] you provide for the uh community and
[36:34] with that you also lower your time
[36:35] preference because your goal all of the
[36:37] sudden shifts from tomorrow to like next
[36:39] year to like the 10 years to the 100
[36:40] years out uh some even beyond that and
[36:43] yeah that's those are amazing summary uh
[36:46] that that you gave us really really cool
[36:48] um perfect and one more thing you also
[36:51] talk sometimes in your morning coffees I
[36:55] love the the video format of like five
[36:58] morning coffee one
[37:00] topic a cheese one sometimes it's also
[37:03] teas coffees my coffee machine broke so
[37:06] so the next couple of of morning coffees
[37:08] will be morning Teese oh teas I I
[37:11] understood cheese I was like morning
[37:16] cheese you also talked about Bitcoin
[37:18] mining and I'm a little bit more getting
[37:21] now into it and trying to figure out how
[37:23] I can contribute to the Bitcoin mining
[37:26] operation basically
[37:28] obviously there's a lot of things
[37:30] happening in mining and I wasn't aware
[37:32] how far we already in in the in the
[37:34] concepts with that and I was wondering
[37:37] if if you are mining how you looking at
[37:39] the mining industry um and uh what you
[37:43] make out of of the mining space yeah um
[37:48] I think mining in particular is super in
[37:51] interesting to understand also like
[37:53] technical or technology wise like what
[37:55] is really happening behind mining so
[37:57] it's just think this is very interesting
[37:59] how we basically in in Broad words
[38:03] capturing time and energy and and
[38:06] putting this into a digital unit and
[38:09] extracting Heat at the same time that we
[38:11] can and this digital unit we can now
[38:14] save on a decentralized network and
[38:17] basically teleport and transform it
[38:19] through through time and space in
[38:22] cyberspace I I just think this is
[38:25] mind-blowing like technology wise what
[38:27] what we were able to do so this is what
[38:29] really brought me into into digging into
[38:32] mining space this was like in in 22 and
[38:35] then obviously the way I started I was
[38:37] reaching out to all those kind of mining
[38:39] companies to the people behind I wanted
[38:41] to understand the business I wanted to
[38:43] understand the business model and and
[38:45] and the industry and um obviously I I
[38:48] connected with hosting providers I
[38:50] connected with electricity providers I I
[38:52] connected with as6 suppliers and and
[38:54] Miners and and I gathered all the kind
[38:57] of knowledge and then I basically just
[38:59] started and and and went away until till
[39:02] till now where I have my own farm and
[39:03] now I'm basically thinking how can I
[39:06] build a product because many people in
[39:08] my environment are asking like how can I
[39:10] participate in in mining and and and to
[39:14] be honest
[39:16] like retail it's it's not easy for
[39:18] retail to to mine profitably as
[39:21] especially in in in German speaking
[39:23] countries for example I mean obviously
[39:25] you you have troubles with with
[39:27] electricity cost so you need to go to to
[39:30] to third countries or emerging countries
[39:32] where where cheap electricity is but
[39:34] what I do like is that basically the
[39:37] goal of all miners is to find the
[39:41] cheapest
[39:42] electricity renewable electricity on
[39:46] mother Planet so all miners are running
[39:49] around where is stranded energy um where
[39:52] is free energy like where do we actually
[39:54] produce too much that we can just deduct
[39:57] um where can we maybe monetize projects
[40:01] like like dams for hydro projects where
[40:05] can we monetize them immediately to
[40:07] build a dam and to plug in those
[40:09] machines to to immediately monetize the
[40:12] entire project and make a win-win for
[40:14] emerging countries who get foreign
[40:17] capital and capital to build
[40:20] infrastructure for the miners for the
[40:23] local
[40:24] communities and that's what I think is
[40:26] super interesting because Bitcoin mining
[40:29] is good for countries Bitcoin mining is
[40:32] good for people Bitcoin mining is good
[40:35] for institutions so I'm really eager to
[40:39] to observe the the next decade who's
[40:42] jumping on board why are they jumping on
[40:45] board and what are they doing with it
[40:47] because we are already growing our food
[40:49] with mining we are already heating our
[40:52] homes with mining it's it's literally
[40:56] nuts so I'm trying to build a product
[40:58] now that puts me in a position to be a
[41:01] doorway or a Gateway for high Networth
[41:04] individuals family offices companies or
[41:07] institutions to participate in Bitcoin
[41:09] mining and to have a exposure in Bitcoin
[41:12] mining because obviously it's it's it's
[41:14] a struggle if if you want to mine
[41:16] Bitcoin right you have to you have to
[41:19] order your Hardware from somewhere in
[41:20] China maybe you don't get it where do
[41:23] you host host it like there are great
[41:25] pre laces in the US Texas there are
[41:28] great places in in Ethiopia where I'm
[41:30] located there are places in in Russia
[41:32] there are places in in South America but
[41:35] where do you go with what kind of
[41:36] machines and this this kind of knowledge
[41:39] collected I want to build this kind of
[41:41] product that I can put into the market
[41:44] to basically allow companies handed
[41:46] worth individuals family offices to have
[41:49] Bitcoin mining exposure and this is what
[41:51] I'm currently trying to build so that I
[41:53] can just build more Bitcoin mining Farms
[41:56] this is this what this this is my goal
[41:58] at the
[41:59] moment super is that kind of the thought
[42:03] of like Bitcoin mining as a service so
[42:05] like those of individuals then can just
[42:08] pay uh for like I don't know $20,000 of
[42:12] rigs uh but you do all uh all the work
[42:16] for them uh and they just split like I
[42:19] don't know 10% 15% of of the of the
[42:22] mining rewards with you correct so I was
[42:25] like since a year I'm I'm thinking about
[42:27] how to build this product to let others
[42:29] participate and obviously one one option
[42:33] for example go mining out there is doing
[42:35] this pretty awesome you can just
[42:37] tokenize your your Bitcoin mining farm
[42:40] right and then provide basically nfts
[42:44] who stands for for real miners but you
[42:47] basically get a virtual minor and you
[42:49] can just purchase basically Tera has for
[42:52] example five five Tera has minor or 10
[42:55] Tera has or maybe a th Terra has min
[42:57] and then based on this you get your
[42:59] daily rewards so this makes it very easy
[43:01] for for retail investors with three
[43:03] clicks you download the app you make an
[43:05] account and you buy an virtual minor and
[43:08] you get your daily rewards on your
[43:10] wallet wallet address so this is one one
[43:13] part I I even tried them out I think I
[43:15] think they're a good solution for for re
[43:17] for retailers who who want to
[43:19] participate in in mining and just click
[43:21] a couple of of of Buton buttons but I do
[43:24] not think that this is the solution
[43:27] that's first of all profitable over the
[43:29] long term I don't think that the
[43:31] solution is going to beat just buy and
[43:33] hold Bitcoin itself so this is why I
[43:36] decided against it and now I basically
[43:39] want to want to build this kind of pro
[43:41] product where like you rightly said
[43:44] where people can participate with an
[43:46] initial investment 20K 50k 100K 500k
[43:51] whatever take this
[43:53] money and increase existing mining oper
[43:57] ations and build new mining
[43:59] farms and partially provide the returns
[44:03] back to the initial investors and this
[44:05] in a legal structured um way this is
[44:08] something I'm currently trying to build
[44:10] so that I can put a product out in the
[44:11] market hey you want to exposure to
[44:13] Bitcoin mining you want to participate
[44:15] in Bitcoin mining I'm going to be your
[44:17] doorway for
[44:19] that interesting I I got because I just
[44:23] now look into that I look into that
[44:26] because was um because of tax advantage
[44:30] I thought like if if you can take your
[44:32] profits instead of giving a part of the
[44:35] profits to the state you can actually
[44:37] take your profits and invest in Bitcoin
[44:39] mining uh uh to to lower your profits
[44:42] and actually uh have a lower tax rate
[44:45] and get into Bitcoin that was kind of my
[44:47] initial thought what which was like oh
[44:49] maybe that Bitcoin mining might be an
[44:51] interesting idea to get KC Free Bitcoin
[44:56] [Music]
[44:58] offset or lower your tax rate and
[45:01] contribute to the Bitcoin security I was
[45:04] like that that seems like an interesting
[45:06] idea but is that even profitable is
[45:08] there a good way to do that and my first
[45:12] two things was sus Mining and abundant
[45:14] mines uh abundant mines was already on
[45:17] the on the podcast the CEO uh so uh I'm
[45:21] I'm still like I'm very early in just
[45:24] looking into the space um but I thought
[45:27] could be very nice uh to to get into
[45:30] that um where you just like buy one rig
[45:33] and you you you get then um I think I
[45:37] think with SAS mining you get like
[45:40] 85% of the rewards and 15% they are
[45:43] keeping uh so it's I don't know how how
[45:47] how um profitable this is I didn't do
[45:50] any calculation till now I'm just like
[45:53] oh right now it's just like a
[45:55] interesting idea in my head and when you
[45:57] talked about that I was like ah that
[45:58] that sounds like uh similar what they uh
[46:01] they doing uh but it's it's something
[46:04] that is has a great potential I think
[46:07] even though I did not do the
[46:08] calculations but you obviously I think
[46:10] probably have done more calculations
[46:11] around that how it actually makes sense
[46:14] because what I always hear is like oh no
[46:16] like just buy Bitcoin uh and you will be
[46:18] way better off like you you will be uh
[46:22] way more uh rewarded with that and you
[46:25] don't have to uh you you don't have to
[46:28] buy Bitcoin miners but yeah uh that's
[46:31] that's kind of why I'm even interested
[46:33] in that topic I mean I can I can share
[46:35] some some some insight right I mean
[46:37] obviously I was stacking Bitcoin and
[46:39] then decided in 22 Jump into Bitcoin
[46:42] mining and obviously also financially
[46:45] wise there was a reason why I made the
[46:48] decision to not only stack Bitcoin but
[46:50] also actually jump into Bitcoin mining
[46:52] and one reason is financial wise yes
[46:55] because in simple words Bitcoin mining
[46:59] is dollar cost average on bitcoin on
[47:03] steroids I give you an example last
[47:06] month cost to mine one Bitcoin for my
[47:09] backfield Foundation
[47:12] 31,000 operating 247 365 everything
[47:16] automated with an upt
[47:19] 99% you don't beat that with buying
[47:22] Bitcoin because I buy Bitcoin for 31,000
[47:26] and sell it
[47:27] obviously I don't sell it right now but
[47:29] at some point but I'm just getting my
[47:32] Bitcoin cheaper than if I would buy it
[47:35] so now you have to ask yourself okay but
[47:37] how do I come to a cost to mine one
[47:39] Bitcoin for like 31 1,000 and obviously
[47:43] and this is the problem when you're like
[47:44] in retail investor into Bitcoin mining
[47:46] and you and you need to participate in
[47:50] like mining as a service or or like
[47:52] Solutions like go mining where you get
[47:54] your nft obviously they they all get
[47:58] something right they all earn their
[47:59] money with their service and their
[48:01] solution which obviously Cuts Cuts your
[48:06] Bitcoin rewards to a point where I
[48:09] personally believe I'd rather recommend
[48:12] if you're at this scale for a retail
[48:14] investor just buy and
[48:16] hold if you are more serious and and
[48:20] want to go into like professional Mining
[48:22] and really participate in building
[48:24] Bitcoin mining forums and increasing the
[48:28] the the hash rate of existing Bitcoin
[48:30] mining Farms then I'd rather encourage
[48:32] participate in something like this
[48:35] because the cost to m one Bitcoin just
[48:37] gets reduced which makes it obviously
[48:40] more profitable for the person who is
[48:42] investing and and and this is something
[48:44] I I basically want to build and create
[48:46] out there so this is something I'm going
[48:48] to provide for the market next
[48:50] year I'm really excited about that
[48:52] really cool let me know when you started
[48:54] because uh I would love to support you
[48:57] true true and I can
[49:00] tellco sometimes people ask me like is
[49:02] Bitcoin mining profitable and you need
[49:06] to understand that Bitcoin mining like
[49:09] the revenue consists of like like four
[49:11] four variables five varibles and 12 of
[49:13] them are unknown right the hash rate the
[49:15] difficulty the Bitcoin price so
[49:18] basically is Bitcoin mining
[49:20] profitable I I cannot tell you over the
[49:23] long term but if you really understood
[49:25] the technology if you really understood
[49:27] Bitcoin this is the moment when you want
[49:29] to get as much Bitcoin as fast as
[49:32] possible right this this is the feeling
[49:34] we have we have never enough Bitcoin so
[49:37] when you when you understand that you
[49:39] want to get as much Bitcoin as possible
[49:41] as fast as
[49:43] possible then Bitcoin mining is a way to
[49:45] do this because you simply get more
[49:47] Bitcoin out of your initiate fear
[49:51] investment for example if you buy if you
[49:54] if you spend 100K today
[49:57] what do you get one Bitcoin
[50:01] almost if you if you would spend the
[50:04] 100K veryify me on the on the numbers
[50:07] obviously you would end up getting over
[50:09] a period of like four years maybe 1.5
[50:11] Bitcoin so you you start um thinking in
[50:14] Cycles you start thinking in fouryear
[50:16] cycles and when you do that then you
[50:19] basically make a deis in in Bitcoin
[50:21] mining because you simply get more
[50:24] Bitcoin
[50:25] rewards than buying over a certain
[50:28] period and the period is roughly 3 to
[50:30] four years so if you have this this
[50:34] Horizon then you get more Bitcoin for
[50:37] your Fiat investment when you
[50:39] participate in Bitcoin
[50:41] mining interesting and it's uh it it it
[50:45] makes a lot of sense for me and I I will
[50:48] try it out anyways uh even if even if my
[50:51] calculations say like oh maybe it's not
[50:53] profitable because I really want to
[50:56] understand it uh on a high level and
[50:58] then people say like oh just buy bid X
[51:01] but that's not uh I I want to understand
[51:05] it to a level of like how can we make it
[51:08] sense that it's also financially viable
[51:12] even without the tax benefit from it
[51:15] obviously for example if you have like I
[51:17] don't know you have end of the year uh
[51:19] with your company uh let's say $100,000
[51:22] left which is not the case with me but
[51:24] let's just make the um um things simple
[51:29] if with that 100,000 if you sell it in
[51:32] Austria with a corporate tax of 23% you
[51:35] have a cut of right there 23% uh less so
[51:40] you only have uh 77 uh yeah
[51:45] $77,000 left from that if you then
[51:49] invest that in the Bitcoin you get what
[51:52] like
[51:53] a not even a 0.8 bitco or something like
[51:57] that from that um and if you invest that
[52:00] in a Bitcoin minor uh you get obviously
[52:03] the 100% from it because you save on the
[52:05] taxes and you might get over the long
[52:08] run with that one machine uh more than
[52:12] one Bitcoin even if you subtract the
[52:14] maintenance cost and electricity cost
[52:16] because what you also have to consider
[52:19] uh if you just buy from a Bitcoin mining
[52:22] service this the service fee that you
[52:25] pay for them at it's like they also have
[52:28] to do the maintenance they're repairing
[52:30] those things and and stuff like that uh
[52:32] and and you pay for the facility and and
[52:34] all those other things so obviously
[52:37] there's Fe to that and yeah and and the
[52:40] thing is
[52:41] like you just buy it and and you get it
[52:45] and you don't have to think about that
[52:47] that that peace of mind is also a lot
[52:49] worth for someone uh and so I I think
[52:54] it's a very nice uh year I just don't
[52:57] know if it's makes Financial sense
[52:59] outside of the tax uh tax benefit but I
[53:02] will look into that and uh yeah maybe we
[53:05] can do in a year um a video where I show
[53:08] my data and show my my my calculations
[53:11] and my actual real world data that I I
[53:14] gathered and see if is if it actually
[53:17] makes sense or if it doesn't make sense
[53:20] outside of taxes uh I think with the tax
[53:23] benefit it it could be a very uh inter
[53:27] option but if but but most probably
[53:29] don't have that option because most
[53:31] don't have a Bitcoin company uh so it's
[53:33] harder for them to to build Tax
[53:36] Strategies around around that um so even
[53:41] it has to make
[53:42] sense from from economical standpoint
[53:45] even without tax benefits so I'm really
[53:48] I'm really looking forward to that
[53:49] actually I think that's that will be an
[53:51] interesting few months ahead of me of
[53:53] research and um actually always post
[53:57] like on my LinkedIn content I I I
[54:00] provide on a monthly basis I provide
[54:02] real real data and real insights on my
[54:06] Foundation mining farm so I provide
[54:09] those kpis because obviously this is a
[54:11] Learning Journey not not just for me but
[54:13] but for everybody so I'm making those
[54:15] numbers actually public and sharing them
[54:19] every month to to to show and to show
[54:22] the world and to to show the
[54:24] people what it means to go into Bitcoin
[54:27] mining what it does and how it Compares
[54:30] so if you're interested in that just
[54:32] just keep following um myself on
[54:34] LinkedIn because I'm providing those
[54:36] those insights and obviously I will keep
[54:38] providing those insights when I'm
[54:40] increasing and building more more of
[54:41] those more of those um farms and you you
[54:45] mentioned the tax benefit and and
[54:46] actually talking to a lot of companies
[54:48] right now who who are looking to get
[54:51] some Bitcoin mining exposure this is a
[54:53] thing I I constantly hear like artd end
[54:56] of the year I need to deduct my profits
[54:59] obviously what what what are the ways to
[55:01] to deduct my profits and obviously
[55:04] buying miners that you can
[55:07] simply pay off or 100% over three years
[55:12] is a good way to deduct your profits and
[55:15] then you have your your your tax
[55:18] situation
[55:20] improved having then machines running
[55:22] for 3 to four years that are generating
[55:25] a revenue stream that you then get at a
[55:27] later stage so this has some some very
[55:29] positive implications for for companies
[55:32] taxwise which definitely is worth
[55:36] checking
[55:37] out interesting yeah I will I will
[55:40] definitely check it out um uh yeah it
[55:44] will it will be fun uh to see and I yeah
[55:47] I will probably link the LinkedIn then
[55:49] for you usually I always link the
[55:51] Twitter profile but if it's is maybe I
[55:53] link just both of you so people can
[55:55] check it out I think it's is it do you
[55:57] provide it in German or in English it's
[55:59] English I I do English content as well
[56:02] very no very good very good so then we
[56:05] can link that and people can check it
[56:06] out if if they're curious about that um
[56:08] last question before we come to the end
[56:10] routine we are obviously extremely
[56:12] bullish right now with the 100K price
[56:14] and it's still feels just as the
[56:17] beginning of the bull run it's just
[56:19] feels like yeah it's it's slowly
[56:21] starting what do you expect for Bitcoin
[56:24] what are you looking forward what is
[56:25] like the 20 25 uh vision for you uh not
[56:28] only from a priz but like what what are
[56:30] your like expectations for for the next
[56:32] year M it's a good question and to be
[56:36] honest I personally and and I know this
[56:38] sounds weird or or maybe stupid I really
[56:42] try to not get distracted by the price
[56:45] the the fat price tag of of Bitcoin I
[56:48] know it's important it's important for
[56:49] us it's important for the community it's
[56:51] important to drive adoption but it
[56:55] also it distracts us and distracts our
[56:58] focus on what we should focus on and I'm
[57:01] more this type of person who really
[57:03] stands behind the the ideologic
[57:07] behind Bitcoin as a tool that detaches
[57:11] money from Central authorities and
[57:13] that's that's really what is going to
[57:16] change the way we live what is CH what
[57:19] does change the way we interact with
[57:21] each other and I really like to focus on
[57:23] how does the future look like with with
[57:26] Bitcoin and how can we actually shape
[57:28] this in a positive way what are the
[57:30] benefits and and what are also the risks
[57:33] associated with that because my personal
[57:36] opinion is that Bitcoin is going up and
[57:38] to the right forever I mean this is at
[57:41] some point obviously you you start to
[57:43] understand that there's only your
[57:44] lifetime that's ticking down every
[57:46] single second and and there's Bitcoin
[57:48] ticking up every second making the block
[57:51] just just m 10 10 minutes before more
[57:53] scarfs and and therefore more value Val
[57:56] valuable your your euro is going to
[57:58] crash your dollar is going to crash your
[58:00] yen is going to crash so Bitcoin is
[58:02] going up and forever whether this is in
[58:04] 25 26 or or whatever this is I think the
[58:07] most important part is how do we onboard
[58:10] more people to to bitcoin standard how
[58:12] do we educate people on what's positive
[58:14] about it how do we educate people on
[58:17] what's negative about it what are the
[58:19] risks associated with it how do we
[58:22] remove those risks and how do we shape a
[58:24] future together that that is better than
[58:27] than the current one for our for our
[58:29] kids and the generations that that will
[58:31] leave so coming back to your questions
[58:34] yes we are going to break the 100K maybe
[58:37] even today yes we are going to break
[58:41] 200k yes we are going to break 300K yes
[58:44] we are going to break 1 million the time
[58:47] nobody knows and nobody can tell there
[58:49] are so many people out there oh it's
[58:51] today it's
[58:52] tomorrow at the end of the day who
[58:54] cares this technology is improving Our
[58:58] Lives how can we focus
[59:01] on using this technology to improve all
[59:04] our lives Bitcoin is from the people for
[59:07] the people so this is what I'm focusing
[59:09] on I'm not too much distracted about the
[59:12] price obviously it helps all of us but
[59:15] whether we are hitting the 1 million by
[59:17] 2030 by 2028 2032 I have no clue nobody
[59:21] has a clue let's just keep driving
[59:23] Bitcoin adoption and the rest comes from
[59:25] itself
[59:27] absolutely it's it just goes up forever
[59:29] because fear is going down forever I I
[59:31] love that really cool um perfect then we
[59:35] have one question that each and every
[59:37] one of my guests uh is getting uh which
[59:40] will be interesting with you what can we
[59:41] learn from you besides
[59:44] Bitcoin besides
[59:46] Bitcoin
[59:47] um obviously being a Bitcoin minor I
[59:50] love proof of
[59:51] work and when I love proof of work I
[59:54] love doing workouts so I do
[59:57] workouts since I'm 36 now I started with
[60:00] like 14 so that's 20 22 years from now
[60:04] and when I started I was very small and
[60:06] Tiny and I was actually playing
[60:08] basketball and I was I was not very
[60:11] talented and I'm also not not as tall as
[60:14] you are so obviously I needed I needed
[60:16] some other benefits and for me this was
[60:18] um being athletic so it was the time I
[60:21] hit the gym doing workouts and I never
[60:23] stopped doing it doing it for now 22
[60:25] years so I know a thing or two about
[60:28] about being healthy about doing healthy
[60:31] sport about um plans to become healthy
[60:35] um to build muscles to build strength
[60:38] and that's part of myself that's part of
[60:40] my mindset that's part of my habit
[60:42] that's part of my daily work and I
[60:45] really enjoy it and I think there's a
[60:46] lot I can talk about about
[60:49] it really cool uh I love it a lot um
[60:53] perfect we have
[60:57] we made a t-shirt we made a t-shirt for
[60:59] this because it's awesome I love it a
[61:01] lot obviously I'm part of 21 bit fluenc
[61:05] so I I want to name them because it's
[61:08] incredible to work alongside people like
[61:10] the 21 bit fluenc like those are
[61:13] including myself 21 capped Bitcoin
[61:18] Maxes OG's out there supporting Bitcoin
[61:22] education Consulting adoption Bitcoin
[61:26] only and drive the vision there are
[61:29] people like you I learn a lot from them
[61:32] and it's just incredible what they do
[61:34] out there what they build out there what
[61:36] they do for Bitcoin companies so if
[61:38] you're a Bitcoin company Bitcoin brand
[61:40] whatever definitely check out the
[61:42] Bitcoin marketing team because they're
[61:44] incredible passionate I love working
[61:47] with them and I think this is a team
[61:49] going to to to go nuts and crazy on all
[61:52] socials right now they have like 190,000
[61:55] followers on N already 60,000 on on
[61:58] LinkedIn building a great Community out
[62:00] there that's very lovely and very caring
[62:02] and just supporting each other and it's
[62:04] just awesome to be part of
[62:06] this yeah the it's really interesting
[62:09] what the Swiss hodler uh started it I
[62:12] think the Swiss harder started it right
[62:14] and and he he he was on my podcast and I
[62:16] think my podcast was actually his his
[62:18] first ever um appearance on a podcast
[62:22] and it kind of outed him uh uh outside
[62:25] of just having his his Twitter profile
[62:28] and it's it's crazy uh to see how he
[62:32] develops and how how bitcoiner developed
[62:34] so it it's it's really cool to see those
[62:38] bitcoiners how they were like a year ago
[62:40] or two years ago and develop over and
[62:42] over in the Bitcoin Community but also
[62:44] outside of the Bitcoin community and
[62:46] yeah I say it actually a lot I love it a
[62:49] lot and very cool it's just like
[62:51] sentences I use so much in the in the
[62:54] podcast uh and it's it's also very cool
[62:57] that there is now a t-shirt uh on on on
[63:00] the 21 bit frer side it's the first
[63:04] actual Robin sire merch I I I I had this
[63:08] t-shirt with like the robin sire podcast
[63:10] and I said it on my store but it's it
[63:12] seems like uh if I I I put that t-shirt
[63:16] out there just because I wanted to have
[63:19] a t-shirt where it says my podcast name
[63:21] especially when I go to conferences
[63:23] stuff like that um I don't expect anyone
[63:26] to buy that because it's not like a cool
[63:29] t-shirt uh it's just like in's name it
[63:31] looks a little bit like for thec the
[63:34] first people already have it Robin the
[63:36] first people already have
[63:37] it that's true yeah but it's uh yeah uh
[63:42] uh very very
[63:44] cool perfect then let's come to the end
[63:46] routine of the podcast um where the
[63:49] previous guest is asking a question for
[63:50] the next guest without knowing who the
[63:51] next guest um actually is um the
[63:54] question from a previous guess is an
[63:56] interesting one do you do you think Elon
[63:58] Musk will be a full throttled Bitcoin
[64:02] Maxi or will he always sheal a
[64:06] shitcoin this is going to be so
[64:08] interesting and I feel like it's um it's
[64:12] a very very interesting time over the
[64:14] next four years what we will see with
[64:15] the Trump legislation and all those
[64:17] bitcoiners around him because obviously
[64:20] we we heard him like Trump we heard him
[64:23] speak we we heard him talk OB ly there
[64:26] are some risks whether he truly is
[64:28] behind this technology or or actually
[64:30] not or actually trying to find a way how
[64:33] how he can maybe beat the technology now
[64:37] you have people like Elon Musk and and
[64:39] so many bitcoiners around him so
[64:42] obviously there's hope there's hope that
[64:44] those people around him drive decisions
[64:48] that are forward thinking that that are
[64:50] long-term long-term thinking um I
[64:53] personally think Elon Musk is a very
[64:55] smart guy and he is he knows what he's
[64:59] doing he has his doge coin right um he
[65:04] he by himself said don't buy this coin
[65:06] it's just there to do some to to do some
[65:08] docks and and maybe to do some merch um
[65:12] obviously probably it's going to be
[65:14] pumped anyway so I'm a little cautious
[65:17] about those crypto stuff they're
[65:20] building right now this crypto team
[65:22] they're going to build now so this is
[65:23] not only Bitcoin only focused which is a
[65:26] risk in the short term but doesn't
[65:28] matter on the long term overall I'm very
[65:31] happy that we have people like Elon Musk
[65:34] um surrounded on on this head like Trump
[65:38] because I feel like they're driving
[65:41] change they're not doing things the way
[65:45] things were done in the past I think
[65:47] they're really driving change and and
[65:49] the way we can change Drive change a lot
[65:52] is through Bitcoin and I think they will
[65:54] do a lot in order to drive adoption for
[65:58] Bitcoin um however associated with
[66:02] Central Authority risks like
[66:05] politics and um obviously we don't know
[66:08] what's going to happen but it's
[66:09] definitely going to be very very
[66:11] interesting for years to observe but one
[66:13] thing is for sure Bitcoin is Unstoppable
[66:16] Bitcoin is a beast and it's going to
[66:19] grow no matter whether there is Trump
[66:21] ilon or
[66:23] whoever at the end of the day it's only
[66:25] about time and and I think we just need
[66:28] to focus on on the time we have on this
[66:31] planet we just need to stay healthy
[66:33] observe and wait because at the end of
[66:35] the day Bitcoin will win
[66:38] anyway I I love this the end of of that
[66:42] really cool um perfect uh we uh before I
[66:46] let you go and I I do think one one
[66:48] thing I want to note here before we end
[66:50] it um I think it's interesting how
[66:53] people assume ill musk is like on in in
[66:57] Dogecoin but with all his companies he
[67:01] ever only bought Bitcoin and he's on the
[67:05] record of saying he has 10x more Bitcoin
[67:10] he bought 10x more Bitcoin then he
[67:12] bought Dogecoin uh so it's it's like he
[67:16] trolls the community I think with like
[67:19] talking about Dogecoin promoting
[67:21] Dogecoin but he buys Bitcoin so like it
[67:26] goes back to watch what they do and not
[67:28] what they say I think IL musk is more of
[67:31] a bitcoiner than he really wants to say
[67:35] for some reason because he's a troll uh
[67:38] and and he he likes to piss off people
[67:40] he likes to say controversial stuff uh
[67:43] he's like the I think Trump and and El
[67:46] musk is an interesting
[67:48] Duo it's going to be wild it's going to
[67:51] be a wild ride it's going to be a wild
[67:53] ride for am
[67:55] [Laughter]
[67:57] but I think it's a positive one to be
[67:58] honest I I even think those are people
[68:01] like we need in Europe as
[68:03] well 100% they are going to drive change
[68:06] now let's let's forget about the outcome
[68:08] for now but they really want to drive
[68:10] positive change for their population
[68:12] this is something we currently see in
[68:14] Germany do they want to drive positive
[68:16] change for the people or do they want to
[68:18] drive positive change for themselves for
[68:21] example cbdc one topic this is they want
[68:24] to drive positive change for themselves
[68:26] not for the people and this is something
[68:29] I really like to observe in countries
[68:31] like eladora and countries like
[68:33] Argentina and countries like like do the
[68:36] us right now I have the feeling whether
[68:39] it's true or not and and let's see
[68:40] whether they keep their promises or not
[68:43] but I just feel more safe that they're
[68:46] trying to drive positive change for the
[68:48] people and at the end of the day this is
[68:50] what we
[68:51] need have you been to El Salvador by the
[68:54] way no not not yet but it's so high on
[68:57] my list I really want to go there so bad
[69:00] this is why I asked you at the beginning
[69:01] of this podcast so many questions around
[69:03] it because obviously I'm following all
[69:05] the German Communities going there
[69:06] visiting there now relocating there like
[69:10] German people relocating to El Salvador
[69:12] like three years ago this was one of the
[69:14] most dangerous cities and there were
[69:17] German wealthy people like those people
[69:20] are are moving now obviously this has
[69:24] something to say this has a meaning and
[69:26] obviously this is driving me to
[69:28] countries like this I I also like I'm
[69:31] very flexible right now and I'm at a
[69:32] point where I say depending on how
[69:35] countries position themselves
[69:38] now depending on such situations this
[69:41] this is how I'm going to change and and
[69:43] and move and not only myself but
[69:45] actually I see it in the entire
[69:47] Community right the Italian bitcoiners
[69:49] sitting right there like let's see
[69:51] what's December going to happen if
[69:52] they're going to make the wrong
[69:54] decisions those people those Talent
[69:56] those those wealth is moving same I see
[69:59] with people like myself and and my
[70:01] community in German speaking
[70:03] countries if we are on a Europe level
[70:06] doing not friendly
[70:09] regulations those people leave Talent
[70:13] goes where they feel good and where they
[70:15] feel comfortable so does wealth wealth
[70:18] goes where they feel accepted happy
[70:20] friendly and I just think that this is
[70:23] very interesting going to observe for
[70:25] the next couple of four to five years
[70:27] where we'll see different countries
[70:29] position themselves
[70:30] differently and this will definitely
[70:32] impact the way the talent flows and the
[70:34] way the capital
[70:36] flows and I just hope that Europe is not
[70:39] sleeping on that because you are 100%
[70:42] right yep so uh that that that's for
[70:46] sure Europe should not sleep on that I I
[70:49] really do hope that but yeah anyways um
