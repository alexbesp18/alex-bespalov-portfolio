[00:00] I am from Iran sanctions from the
[00:02] outside and the limitations from the
[00:04] inside I cannot have PayPal I cannot
[00:06] have credit card that is globally
[00:07] accepted what do I do is there an open
[00:10] source money and I found that oh there
[00:13] is this open source money which is
[00:14] called Bitcoin I don't expect Warren
[00:16] Buffett to understand Bitcoin but some
[00:19] people I think they do understand it
[00:20] Jamie Diamond I don't think he does not
[00:23] understand it I am 100% sure that nebil
[00:26] Gates does understand Bitcoin and it's
[00:28] going to even surprise when the price
[00:30] goes up we are like whoa whoa why did it
[00:33] happen so fast why did it happen so
[00:35] [Music]
[00:39] quickly let's get started with uh who
[00:41] you are and and what are you doing in
[00:43] Bitcoin yeah I'm Momo the content
[00:46] manager at 21st capital I got to know
[00:49] Bitcoin because of my interest in
[00:52] open-source software in general and the
[00:55] open source movement I really liked
[00:58] Linux and I like to find alternatives
[01:01] for everything open source and I am from
[01:04] Iran so we live in a place between the
[01:09] between irck and a hard place so
[01:12] sanctions from the outside and the
[01:14] limitations from the
[01:16] inside kind completely disconnects us
[01:19] from any kind of trade direct trade with
[01:22] the outside world and I was thinking
[01:24] that I cannot have PayPal I cannot have
[01:26] credit card that is globally accepted
[01:28] what do I do
[01:30] is there an open- Source money and I
[01:33] found that oh there is this open source
[01:35] money which is called Bitcoin so I
[01:38] really needed Bitcoin and it show it
[01:41] showed up before my
[01:43] eyes uh and as an Iranian I didn't need
[01:46] any reasoning as to see yeah this really
[01:50] solved that problem solve this problem I
[01:53] knew the problem and I was looking for
[01:54] the solution I found it but I didn't
[01:57] really become a bitcoiner then uh it was
[02:00] maybe in 2021 or so that I really
[02:04] started to understand Bitcoin thanks to
[02:06] an interview with Saed he was on a
[02:10] podcast that I was following and then
[02:14] things started to click that Bitcoin is
[02:16] not that money that only nerds would
[02:19] like and U I started going down the
[02:24] rapid hole since then interesting yeah
[02:28] the the the open source aspect is really
[02:30] interesting because most people Overlook
[02:32] that like uh like the open source
[02:35] Community um is is quite big with
[02:38] Bitcoin obviously as it's open source um
[02:41] why were you um in Open Source before
[02:45] like what was the interest in in open
[02:46] source yeah the values of Open Source
[02:49] and the security that open source
[02:51] brought with it were very interesting to
[02:53] me and another part of it was that we
[02:57] were not able to easily purchase for for
[02:59] example a copy of Windows or a copy of a
[03:02] certain software or even if we could
[03:04] they were really really expensive for
[03:06] our money for example imagine buying
[03:09] Adobe premere or any Adobe product with
[03:13] some currency that has that depreciates
[03:16] in value all the time so I was really
[03:19] interested in these open- Source
[03:21] Solutions uh such as
[03:23]  inkscape stuff like that and
[03:28] Audacity Of course that I used to till
[03:30] this
[03:31] day um and I like the openness of it and
[03:36] that there are eyes on the project that
[03:38] can look at it if something goes wrong
[03:41] they can see it so this was very
[03:43] important to me it was free and also
[03:46] free as they say it was free as in free
[03:49] beer and free as like the Free World um
[03:53] so these aspects were very important to
[03:55] me interesting do do you think there's
[03:58] always this debate of open source versus
[04:00] closed source and I think Bitcoin is
[04:02] such an beautiful example how open
[04:04] source technology is just way better
[04:07] than closed sourced uh technology um is
[04:10] there a limit to what can be open source
[04:13] do you think like at some point open
[04:15] source will will will win the war
[04:18] against closed Source yeah definitely in
[04:21] the beginning everything that starts
[04:22] open source is very limited I don't know
[04:26] maybe this is a good example because I
[04:29] have seen more people using it for
[04:31] example when you think of of Adobe
[04:33] Photoshop there is this very tiny very
[04:37] light weight
[04:39] open-source um alternative to it which
[04:41] is called and in the beginning it
[04:45] was really terrible it would crash all
[04:49] the time but when um after some time
[04:54] after some years it became really solid
[04:57] that I really find the need to install
[05:01] Adobe uh Photoshop at all or get a
[05:05] license for it or a trial for it or get
[05:08] someone who has it um the other one that
[05:12] I has really addressed all my needs is
[05:15] audacity and maybe that also started
[05:18] from very humble beginnings that it
[05:21] maybe crashed a lot but since the day I
[05:24] have I've had it it has rarely crashed
[05:28] and it's been very good with SA things
[05:30] and I have been doing all my audio
[05:32] editing in that even till this day some
[05:35] of the audio editing when I am writing
[05:38] some script for the videos I'm making I
[05:41] all the editing is done there so it
[05:44] might start from the beginning with very
[05:47] from a very humble start but because
[05:49] there are eyes on on it even if it is
[05:52] something very complicated like video
[05:54] editing or 3D uh video production over
[05:59] time they will will improve and even um
[06:03] P proprietary software will kind of
[06:06] steal them or hijack them interesting is
[06:09] is that the like is that the reason why
[06:12] all the really good products right now
[06:16] are kind of close T like the the if you
[06:19] look at uh even like canva for example I
[06:22] use all the time it's an amazing tool
[06:25] it's I never had to use Photoshop
[06:27] because like conas can literally do
[06:28] everything uh and uh yeah also the we
[06:32] record on Riverside this is close to
[06:34] like it seems like most of the
[06:37] applications are still close to us I
[06:40] actually use
[06:41] audacity uh sometimes like very rarely
[06:44] but sometimes I do actually use it um
[06:47] but uh even that uh very rarely so the
[06:53] the probably one of the only open-source
[06:55] technologies that I intentionally use is
[06:58] Bitcoin
[06:59] uh which which is kind of funny to to
[07:02] think about uh why closed Source it
[07:06] seems to be uh currently in such a good
[07:11] position of like so so much better than
[07:13] than open source um makes no sense for
[07:16] me because like open source should be
[07:19] way more available for people and makes
[07:22] people more included but probably it's
[07:24] also harder to make money with with open
[07:26] source I guess it is definitely a
[07:28] challenge to make money though there are
[07:30] business models for open source um for
[07:33] example the software itself is free but
[07:36] the services are not free uh I can
[07:39] perfectly imagine a world where for
[07:42] example canva is free but the processing
[07:46] power needed to do all those amazing
[07:48] things it does in a matter of
[07:51] minutes for that processing power you
[07:54] need to pay I can imagine a world where
[07:57] where we go towards such Solutions and
[08:00] the reason that Riverside and canva are
[08:03] still not open source I think is that
[08:06] because they are in a package that the
[08:09] processing comes with it there's a
[08:11] huge uh maybe buildings of gpus that are
[08:16] providing services to all people around
[08:18] the world and if you want to do it for
[08:21] your own use case it would not be much
[08:25] worth it uh I think these Services still
[08:29] there is a place for them to be not open
[08:32] source and I am very optimistic and I
[08:36] would see it coming that uh competitors
[08:41] to canva will show up as the in a
[08:44] similar way that open source competitors
[08:47] to chat GPT have come up deeps is one of
[08:50] them uh if you choose to use the website
[08:53] your data goes to the government of
[08:55] China and it is stored there but you can
[08:57] also run it on your own Miss machine
[08:59] there is llama GPT if you want to run it
[09:02] on your own GPU you need to spend a lot
[09:05] of money on the
[09:06] GPU uh but you can also you have the
[09:10] choice to run it
[09:12] yourself so I think the solutions to for
[09:16] such complicated things are also coming
[09:18] along the limitation is the processing
[09:21] power and I think companies will be
[09:24] around for providing those processing
[09:27] Powers still while the suffer itself
[09:30] will become totally free and open source
[09:33] yeah for AI especially it seems very
[09:36] important that it's uh open source like
[09:38] it it's it seems like like Ai and money
[09:43] seems to be like the most important
[09:46] things to be open sourced uh like if if
[09:49] Cana stays closed sourced I can live
[09:53] with that yes if money is close to us I
[09:56] cannot live with that yes and I I really
[09:59] love your wording you said that they are
[10:01] too important and they need to be open
[10:04] source AI it is important that we have
[10:07] it open source because we ask chat GPD
[10:10] some questions and it has some kind of
[10:12] ideology that answers through that lens
[10:16] as a kind of alternative that bitcoiners
[10:19] would like to I use unleashed. chat that
[10:21] you can log in with your Noster public
[10:23] key in it and ask questions it will take
[10:26] of course uh hundreds of years to answer
[10:29] one question but it's a good experiment
[10:32] and you can choose which um AI machine
[10:35] or AI model you want to use uh yeah
[10:38] these things are really important and
[10:40] you know I am living in a country that
[10:43] and I don't speak the language veryable
[10:46] I want to sign a contract I do not want
[10:50] my personal information to go to the
[10:52] centralized Ai and Sam Alman know uh
[10:56] know all about me it's very important
[10:58] for me me um that I can give the
[11:03] contract or any text that H has my uh
[11:07] personal details to my own
[11:10] Ai and it is processed locally or even
[11:13] if it is processed somewhere else uh the
[11:15] data is encrypted and that would be I
[11:18] don't know how that would be possible
[11:20] maybe that that would be some smart
[11:23] people would come up with the way the
[11:24] way they came up with a solution for our
[11:27] money uh yeah these things are too
[11:30] important to be just trusted with a
[11:33] closed Source bundle yeah and with AI
[11:36] you like for example I always speak with
[11:40] a like asking questions literally have
[11:42] it laying on the table and it's like oh
[11:44] like how is that working oh like now
[11:46] this problem cames like how how can I
[11:48] solve solve this or how can I automize
[11:51] this or how can I work better with that
[11:53] so you you almost have an kind of a
[11:56] friend inside of the house or like an
[11:59] assist s inside of the house that you
[12:01] speak to
[12:03] and and you have to always keep in mind
[12:07] that this is not a real person or real
[12:10] real friend that's literally a data um
[12:17] searching uh machine that just wants as
[12:19] much data as possible from you uh and
[12:22] processes that in a really good way uh
[12:26] so you have to always be aware of that
[12:27] it kind of hard to be was aware of that
[12:29] if you if you speak with it and and it's
[12:31] friendly and it has a nice voice and it
[12:34] almost feels like your assistant your
[12:37] your friend it's it's it's there for you
[12:39] when you have some problems of
[12:41] whatsoever kind that that's a it's a
[12:44] hard hard hard reality to always keep in
[12:47] mind and be aware yeah I I wonder
[12:49] whether you have seen the movie hair I
[12:52] think I watched it in 2012 or something
[12:56] around that it was out in 2011 20
[12:59] 12 her h e r i mean third person she um
[13:05] so it's the same story that there is
[13:07] this guy um who breaks up with his
[13:10] girlfriend and he works in a company
[13:12] where people do not have time to write
[13:14] letters to each other so they ask a
[13:18] company to write letters for them and
[13:21] answer letters for them and he's very
[13:23] well known for his uh great writing
[13:26] abilities and writing skills so he
[13:30] becomes one of the best um writers but
[13:35] in the process in that world which I
[13:38] thought is yeah definit that that's
[13:41] exactly that exactly it I was thinking
[13:43] that that world is far
[13:46] away uh when we were watching that and I
[13:49] was making fun of it and the guy speaks
[13:51] to an AI uh his charged phone and he
[13:55] speaks to it and it has a name it has a
[13:57] female voice and and they started a
[13:59] relationship it's becoming a reality
[14:02] there are people who put their AI their
[14:06] AI versions of they train the the AI
[14:09] with the answers they would give and
[14:13] they even monetize that this is crazy
[14:15] and this has become reality something
[14:17] that I watched and didn't like and I was
[14:20] like this is too much for me this is too
[14:24] unreal but this is
[14:26] happening so it is really as you said
[14:30] difficult to think the
[14:33] AI is not a real person sometimes my
[14:36] friends made fun of me how I communicate
[14:39] with AI the chat chat GPT in the
[14:41] beginning I would use the word please a
[14:44] complete sentences with Correct
[14:46] capitalization and
[14:48] everything and my friends would say that
[14:50] yeah your relationship with AI is a bit
[14:53] worrying uh but I reassure you I have a
[14:55] girlfriend so I am a healthy human being
[14:58] I still appreciate uh human beings uh
[15:04] but yeah it's really difficult not to
[15:06] mistake them with something that is not
[15:07] real and some time ago a real popped up
[15:11] there was a girl asking the AI for
[15:13] something it's a it's a short video it's
[15:15] a one minute video and uh it's some
[15:19] question about her thesis I guess and
[15:21] the AI answers it and she is typing and
[15:25] she forgets the word please and then she
[15:27] thinks to herself that I should add the
[15:29] word please and then fast forward and
[15:32] all of this is happening in one minute
[15:33] of short video on YouTube or maybe Tik
[15:36] Tok it had been and then it repurpose
[15:38] for YouTube uh fast forward and she is
[15:43] uh in a kind of AI apocalypse that AI
[15:46] has taken over the world like in
[15:48] Terminator and the AI looks at her and
[15:51] Spurs her life because AI she was nice
[15:55] to AI yeah it's a it's a it's a real uh
[15:59] it it's something to think about like uh
[16:01] I I I don't think that AI there's like
[16:06] this this super danger of like AI
[16:09] destroying humans but there is this
[16:11] danger of like AI is keeping us like
[16:14] pets like this is like like like why did
[16:17] we keep pets like we we we don't need
[16:20] dogs or or cats and maybe in the same
[16:23] sense AI at some point doesn't need
[16:25] humans but they keep us around I don't
[16:27] know like I I I hope that if AI gets way
[16:31] better than humans uh and way more
[16:33] advanced humans that they don't destroy
[16:35] us treat us like cats or dogs they treat
[16:39] us like pets and cuddle us yeah I hope
[16:43] so like I don't like if I look like I
[16:47] currently don't have a dog here in my
[16:49] apartment but um back at my parents home
[16:51] we have a dog and I'm like like this
[16:54] life is amazing like he he gets food he
[16:56] gets the a big house like he get street
[16:59] that like everyone loves in like it's
[17:02] it's kind of like like if if AI looks at
[17:04] us as how we are looking at dogs may
[17:07] maybe it's not that
[17:09] bad but I do do do think we should use
[17:12] yeah in a good way and a responsible way
[17:14] and definitely open source it to have at
[17:17] least a chance yes
[17:20] exactly yeah absolutely what do you
[17:23] think is the the impact that AI has on
[17:26] on on bitcoin the the uh connection
[17:29] between uh two technologies that are
[17:32] growing so fast right now uh and
[17:34] impacting our lives in in in a major way
[17:37] um what do you think is the connection
[17:39] there or the impact between Ai and
[17:42] Bitcoin yeah I have a kind of uh
[17:45] optimistic view that um for
[17:50] resources AI can rely on bitcoin that
[17:53] you for example make your own
[17:55] Ai and you ask your car to get the tank
[18:01] full of uh gas or maybe plug itself to
[18:04] electricity electricity and for all of
[18:07] these you they are resources and for
[18:11] using those resources you need money and
[18:13] it cannot just use something until it
[18:17] dies or until that resource just goes
[18:20] away or uh that resource finishes up um
[18:26] resources are valuable to us and we have
[18:28] to have a kind of common language to
[18:30] communicate this value and Bitcoin can
[18:34] become integrated to the AI that if we
[18:36] have ai
[18:38] systems and we ask an AI machine to
[18:42] build a car for us build a rocket for us
[18:44] it will go and do that and for getting
[18:46] the
[18:48] resources it needs Bitcoin to pay for
[18:50] those so I think that in a kind of
[18:53] sci-fi future and maybe that future is
[18:57] closer than we think like the example I
[18:59] gave of her that I once laughed at like
[19:02] RoboCop that when I was watched as a
[19:05] child I was like this is just crazy
[19:07] maybe as a child I believed it but as I
[19:09] grew up I was like it is too crazy and
[19:11] things like that are actually happening
[19:14] now uh things that were uh were kind of
[19:18] predicted in Robocop are happening
[19:21] now and uh maybe that future is not that
[19:25] far away and we can get servants that
[19:28] our Ai and AI if you are hearing me
[19:30] forgive me for saying using the word
[19:33] servant maybe they can do things for us
[19:36] and for the resources that they need to
[19:38] get they would use uh Bitcoin to buy
[19:41] things here to buy things there buy
[19:43] things in Iran buy things in Saudi
[19:46] Arabia buy things in the United States
[19:48] so it becomes the common language and I
[19:50] have this kind of pet thesis pet
[19:53] hypothesis that Bitcoin can become the
[19:56] common language of us all
[19:59] um I have repeated this on other
[20:03] occasions
[20:04] and this idea came to me when I was
[20:07] listening to the story of Snow Crash
[20:10] it's a favorite book of Adam back by uh
[20:15] Nile Stevenson if I'm uh remembering the
[20:19] name of the author right he talks about
[20:23] the uh Tower of Babel and how in the
[20:27] biblical story people were all people
[20:31] spoke the same language and because they
[20:33] could speak the same language they could
[20:35] cooperate easily and
[20:37] convey uh Concepts without compromise
[20:41] and
[20:42] without you know things being Lost in
[20:46] Translation and as a result they could
[20:48] make this big
[20:50] tower and God from the sky was like oh
[20:53] if they can cooperate and make such a uh
[20:57] big tower hi Tower they can get to me
[21:01] they can get to my
[21:02] kingdom so he God makes the languages of
[21:06] all the people different and that is the
[21:08] biblical story about uh how languages
[21:11] became uh became different and
[21:16] varying so we are living in that world
[21:19] we are living in that Fiat world that
[21:21] Iran has reals sa Saudi Arabia has its
[21:24] own reals United States has in its own
[21:27] dollar
[21:29] Canada has its own dollar uh some part
[21:32] of the world has Euro you have Euro i i
[21:35] in Poland have
[21:36] Z and every one of us is talking a
[21:40] different language for transmitting
[21:42] value
[21:44] but this is a hindrance because we have
[21:48] to worry about the conversion rate where
[21:50] this money is accepted where it is not
[21:53] but when we have Bitcoin Bitcoin is
[21:54] Bitcoin is Bitcoin it can be accepted
[21:57] everywhere and it can have similar value
[22:01] everywhere um so if it becomes the
[22:03] language common language of us all in
[22:06] terms of value we can make that Tower of
[22:10] Babble again and get to the sky I
[22:13] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[22:16] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[22:19] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[22:22] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[22:24] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[22:28] that's the the perfect subtle elegent
[22:30] way to go out there and show that you
[22:32] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[22:36] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[22:39] dropped a completely new and amazing
[22:42] Genesis edition of their watch
[22:44] collections you have the date of the
[22:46] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[22:50] and of course also the block height and
[22:53] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[22:56] level of detail they put in in this

[24:24] there are so many interesting things
[24:26] like the the the chance of the whole
[24:30] nation or the whole world using one
[24:33] language and one
[24:35] money the co
[24:38] collaboration uh aspect of unlocking the
[24:41] best ideas uh unlocking the best
[24:44] cooperation between human beings is just
[24:48] amazing to see and I think that's what
[24:51] hopefully also happens uh with with
[24:54] Bitcoin becoming the world Reserve
[24:57] currency and asset and then also on the
[24:59] other hand when we have ai
[25:02] translation it it basically doesn't like
[25:05] you don't care what language other
[25:08] person speaks I just speak in my
[25:10] microphone and and you hear in whatever
[25:12] language you like to hear me speaking
[25:15] and you uh speak and I hear you in
[25:17] whatever language I like to hear that
[25:19] like that uh real time AI translation or
[25:23] video calls that will be reality I think
[25:26] not that far away I mean it's it's
[25:28] always already kind of possible uh with
[25:30] some workarounds and a little clunky but
[25:33] uh that that will be a game Cher for
[25:36] like human interaction and
[25:38] collaboration pair that with sound money
[25:41] pair that with permissionless sound
[25:43] money that's globally available um so we
[25:47] can we don't have to pay a lot of fees
[25:49] to like remittances and stuff like that
[25:52] we we can just talk to each other we
[25:54] don't have to fly to each other that
[25:56] that will unlock a lot of like that will
[25:59] unlock a lot of the power of bit a lot
[26:01] of the power of the humans definitely as
[26:03] you said as I said it's not far away
[26:07] these all may seem crazy but once we
[26:10] were thinking about having you know kind
[26:13] of universal username and password it's
[26:15] it really sucks that for entering Gmail
[26:17] I I use a set of username and password
[26:19] for um for Riverside you use some
[26:23] something else for Cano I use something
[26:25] else for streamyard something else for
[26:27] disc script something else for every
[26:28] tool we use something else uh for
[26:31] Facebook for Twitter for X um but for
[26:34] Noster this very beautiful world has
[26:38] been born where we have a uh a public
[26:42] key and a private key and with that I
[26:45] can log to one app that is built on
[26:47] Noster which is Primal the other app
[26:50] which is called damus I can stream my
[26:54] show with you when we invite you on 21st
[26:57] Capital hopefully soon
[26:59] and it's going to be streamed on all our
[27:02] U all all the other Noster apps and they
[27:05] can click uh on it and they can pay us
[27:08] in zaps when they are watching it uh so
[27:12] I can use this as I said I I can use the
[27:15] same username and password to enter
[27:17] unleashed. chat and ask my questions
[27:21] from the AI uh that is hosted somewhere
[27:25] and doesn't store my data but it is
[27:28] monetized by the money that I pay in
[27:30] saps it's just crazy that we have the
[27:33] Noster protocol and the whole internet
[27:35] is being built on that we have the AI
[27:38] that is being buil built on that we have
[27:39] the kind of YouTube that is being built
[27:42] built on that uh we have the kind of
[27:45] streaming service that is being buil
[27:46] built on that and the the most usual uh
[27:50] application of it is social media we can
[27:52] have something similar to X or Facebook
[27:56] but without zaker
[27:58] or Jack dors in the time and Elon at the
[28:01] current time I really feel the
[28:03] difference when I am
[28:05] using uh a Noster application such as
[28:09] Primal when I am on on Twitter Twitter
[28:14] just wants to keep your eyes on that but
[28:17] on Noster users want to keep you there
[28:21] and uh there's a difference it kind of
[28:24] changes everything there the algorithm
[28:27] once to keep you there but here you have
[28:30] a choice which app you use and which
[28:33] algorithm you use I simply want to see
[28:35] the posts of the people that I follow I
[28:38] do not want to want it to know what I am
[28:41] interested in I don't want it to excite
[28:44] me I just want it to be pure signal I
[28:47] just log into X and it suddenly pops up
[28:51] some story that has gotten some
[28:53] Impressions which is related to Iranian
[28:55] politics and suddenly I have to care
[28:58] about that and I suddenly have to hate
[29:00] that person or love that other person I
[29:02] don't care a Noster it is not something
[29:04] that happens you just see the posts from
[29:08] the people that you have decided to
[29:10] follow and if you have if you want to
[29:13] you can create such kind of algorithm
[29:16] that uh works with the AI and grabs the
[29:19] post that you like but that is your
[29:21] choice but with X with uh Facebook with
[29:25] Instagram you do not have that choice so
[29:28] that's a revolutionary thing and people
[29:30] were thinking about you know using our
[29:32] cornea as a kind of integrated username
[29:35] and password for everything now we can
[29:38] use our npop and private key from Noster
[29:40] to log into everything and unlock a
[29:43] whole new world of possibilities which
[29:45] is of course also powered by Bitcoin and
[29:49] the creator of that is a Bitcoin
[29:52] maximalist um Fiat jaff he was active in
[29:56] the world of Bitcoin uh he had some I
[29:59] got to know him through a telegram bot
[30:02] that he had written
[30:04] for lightning
[30:06] payments and then he F started focusing
[30:09] on
[30:10] Noster and this is a whole new world
[30:13] that is being built on sound money there
[30:16] it it's it's amazing like like first of
[30:19] all just like a small addition on
[30:21] Twitter you can actually choose to uh
[30:24] build a list with people and then you
[30:25] actually just see those but you can
[30:28] choose like your own algorithm uh but uh
[30:31] for for people that are like for example
[30:33] me uh for people that are frustrated
[30:36] with the Twitter
[30:37] algorithm um because it just feeds your
[30:40] exciting stuff like fight tws and and
[30:42] then some Wars and like I don't I'm not
[30:45] interested in that um you can actually
[30:47] go ahead and create lists with people
[30:49] that you like and those lists you can
[30:51] actually pin to your home profile and
[30:53] then you just like one tab on that list
[30:55] and all of the sudden you only see uh
[30:58] tweets from the the the people that you
[31:01] put in that list and also in sequence uh
[31:05] the good old T of of like having
[31:07] sequence but uh uh obviously you cannot
[31:11] choose your own algorithm you cannot uh
[31:13] and and the biggest thing for me for
[31:14] Nostra is actually the the openness of
[31:16] the network so a small example is I am
[31:20] on um Fountain uh from a podcast so you
[31:24] can listen to that podcast on Fountain
[31:26] so like we currently on that podcast so
[31:28] statistically speaking around two% or
[31:31] like 1% something like that uh of all
[31:34] podcast listeners listen now on
[31:36] fountains so like Hello to that 1% uh
[31:39] and they uh can retweet that uh retweet
[31:43] that or read re repost that uh on on on
[31:47] Noster I have connected techically they
[31:50] boost
[31:51] that yeah the they they boost uh that
[31:54] and so it's it's it's super interesting
[31:56] uh because I get the replies from
[31:59] Fountain directly in Fountain and and I
[32:02] can reply to them and then later if I uh
[32:06] log in into Primal I have it there if
[32:09] someone replied again so so this is kind
[32:13] of the the best thing for me about noso
[32:16] currently um imagine a world where you
[32:19] have a YouTube video and you post
[32:22] something under this YouTube video and
[32:25] uh you reply to that and later you on
[32:28] Twitter and you can see the same thing
[32:31] and this is the the same thing that
[32:33] happens uh when we have we speak all the
[32:35] same language or we use all the same
[32:37] money when we use all the same
[32:40] communication Network that's the next
[32:42] step towards that um I see a lot of uh a
[32:47] lot of development that still has to
[32:49] happen in order for nost to reach any
[32:51] type of critical mass um but this kind
[32:55] of openness of the net network is just
[32:59] uh mindboggling what could happen with
[33:02] that um and my deepest hope is that that
[33:07] nostro becomes uh so big that all the
[33:11] social media apps at at some point just
[33:15] uh put themselves also on Nostra they
[33:19] they can still be Twitter or act but
[33:23] they can also put their contents
[33:25] directly on uh uh nostr I don't know if
[33:29] that's happening I don't know if they
[33:32] die or and
[33:34] then uh the Nostra can succeed a long
[33:37] term or X and Facebook and all those
[33:40] integrate actually with Nostra uh or
[33:44] Nosa doesn't become successful we need
[33:46] another thing or like whatever happens
[33:48] I'm I'm not very an expert on that but I
[33:52] do hope that we get an open protocol
[33:55] where I can communicate with anyone
[33:58] another aspect sorry I'm I'm stopping in
[34:01] a minute um another aspect of that is uh
[34:04] I am very reachable like I'm on Twitter
[34:08] Instagram I'm on Signal I'm on telegram
[34:11] I'm on WhatsApp I'm on normal messages
[34:15] like I get messages from family friends
[34:19] uh colleagues uh from from Bitcoin
[34:23] people on I don't know seven different
[34:26] Messengers uh and I hate
[34:29] that I I would love to have like one app
[34:32] for that um and email obviously like
[34:35] there so many more replies and comments
[34:39] so like I would love to have like just
[34:40] like one Inox where where everything
[34:42] comes in there but it's dangerous to
[34:44] have one INB inbox because then it's
[34:48] centralized outside of it being an open
[34:51] protocol like Nostra where it's
[34:52] decentralized but still one inbox so
[34:54] that's the optimal thing like I'm I'm
[34:57] very I'm very optimistic what when it
[34:59] comes to that future I don't know if
[35:01] nostris is it probably but I don't know
[35:04] uh but I I do hope that we come to that
[35:08] future and uh also from a content
[35:11] creator standpoint you probably know
[35:12] that also I have to upload the same
[35:16] podcast video now to five different
[35:19] platforms um it's okay for me I have to
[35:22] do copy paste stuff uh but uh it would
[35:25] be great to just do one plat for and
[35:28] then everyone can see it h so like there
[35:30] are a lot of things why I'm excited
[35:32] about Nostra I'm I'm I really do hope it
[35:35] it is something
[35:37] successful yeah actually I we see eye to
[35:39] eye on that too because you know we are
[35:42] both content creators I am content
[35:44] creator for 21st Capital you are a
[35:47] independent content creator and we share
[35:50] the same kind of responsibilities when I
[35:52] want to post something on YouTube I have
[35:54] to you know kind of post it on telegram
[35:56] too or post a link to that but when
[36:00] things are happening on nost when I for
[36:02] example stream a video on zap stream I
[36:04] don't have to log into Dam I don't have
[36:06] to log into Primal from the zap stream
[36:10] itself I say share it on noer and
[36:13] everyone using any kind of app as long
[36:16] as they want to see that kind or that
[36:20] event I think kind is the technical term
[36:23] they are going to see that and that's
[36:25] really beautiful and that's really
[36:28] removes lots of lots of friction it's
[36:31] magical absolutely um and there are so
[36:34] many question marks on like why Nostra
[36:38] or if Noster will be successful I'm very
[36:41] sure that some technology like that will
[36:43] be successful and uh right now obviously
[36:46] Nosa would be the winner of that uh but
[36:50] I'm I don't I I don't I I no longer have
[36:53] the question if Bitcoin will be
[36:55] successful I don't know if you also feel
[36:57] like that I had those questions like two
[36:59] years ago uh but right now I'm um I
[37:02] don't have those questions anymore of
[37:04] like will bit could be successful it's
[37:06] more about the question of like how will
[37:10] it get there and and uh what will be the
[37:13] the the Milestones along those ways and
[37:15] and and what what will be the the way of
[37:18] getting there we I know I see I see the
[37:21] goal I know we will get it getting there
[37:23] I just don't know exactly how long we
[37:25] will have to walk there and and which
[37:28] path we're taking exactly um but that's
[37:32] what I'm currently most uh interested in
[37:34] one question that um I think I never
[37:37] asked that really really it just came up
[37:39] to my
[37:40] mind why why was Bitcoin like why is
[37:43] Bitcoin successful do you think like why
[37:46] why was like we had ecash we had other
[37:48] um tries before people tried that kind
[37:52] of thing already before what do you
[37:54] think is the main thing that made
[37:56] Bitcoin successful in the last 15 years
[37:59] learning from previous mistakes learning
[38:02] from the mistake of
[38:03] ecash uh learning from the mistake of
[38:07] eold and learning from the falling of
[38:10] all the empires and all the Fiat monies
[38:13] was what made Bitcoin successful because
[38:17] it looked at all those experiences and
[38:20] it was like how am I going to solve that
[38:23] problem this problem this problem and by
[38:26] making it an open Source blockchain
[38:29] satos a commodo solve this problem and
[38:33] that's why it's becoming successful
[38:35] because we have done all the wrong
[38:37] things until we have gotten to the right
[38:40] solution I love that we've we've done
[38:43] all the wrong things until we got to the
[38:45] right solution
[38:47] nice yeah really cool um how do you
[38:50] think Bitcoin will uh will keep winning
[38:53] what what do you think is like the the
[38:55] next uh corner stones or the next events
[38:59] that we kind of have to to the master to
[39:01] get to the next level or like what do
[39:03] you see in in terms of like um uh
[39:07] adoption that that we have to to master
[39:10] next sometimes these adoption events are
[39:14] happening so quickly but sometimes you
[39:16] know these politicians do all kinds of
[39:18] untrustworthy things that you expect
[39:20] from politicians uh just a couple of
[39:23] nights ago jaier mle I had so much hopes
[39:27] in him and I learned a lot from him
[39:29] suddenly he started his own shitcoin
[39:31] mcoin uh Trump did it the day he became
[39:34] the president and the next uh night his
[39:38] wife did it um B has been good on that
[39:42] he has kept Bitcoin and no shet
[39:45] coining um but from the Grassroots I
[39:49] think things are changing uh eventually
[39:52] it is the decision of every one of us
[39:55] that is make Bitcoin Bitcoin um
[39:59] politicians might accelerate it and
[40:02] sometimes might hinder it with the kind
[40:04] of policies that they follow but this is
[40:07] a money that cannot be stopped if they
[40:10] support it we get to the Citadel faster
[40:14] if they don't support it we will get
[40:17] there we will just make themselves poor
[40:22] in the uh meantime and some of them
[40:24] might not be poor for example I I really
[40:27] doubt people who are talking about
[40:30] Bitcoin really don't have any Bitcoin
[40:34] some people I get for example I don't
[40:36] expect Warren Buffett to understand
[40:38] Bitcoin he's an old guy I really respect
[40:41] him and I have learned a lot from him
[40:44] and I still uh learn from his codes I
[40:48] don't follow him personally but he has
[40:50] had a great impact on my life and um I
[40:53] know people who follow him and I get the
[40:55] second hand advice from Warren Buffett
[40:57] too and he has he's an interesting
[40:59] person I don't expect him to understand
[41:02] Bitcoin but some people I think they do
[41:05] understand it Jamie Diamond I don't
[41:06] think he does not understand it I don't
[41:09] think that uh Bill Gates does not
[41:12] understand it I am 100% sure that bit
[41:15] Bill Gates does understand Bitcoin the
[41:17] early days of my introduction to bitcoin
[41:21] I was very surprised to learn that
[41:24] uh Bill Gates had endorsed bit coin and
[41:28] I was like what Bill Gates would go to
[41:31] open source forums and post under his
[41:34] own name and talk about open source
[41:38] that open source is going to fail
[41:39] because of this and because of that and
[41:41] he's he's kind of supporting an open
[41:44] source money what's going on years later
[41:47] he started sh talking about Bitcoin too
[41:50] and then it was a time that I was like
[41:52] yes we are really on the right path if
[41:55] Bill Gates is uh saying that we are on
[41:57] the wrong path but I think he has
[42:00] understood it I think he knows how
[42:03] valuable Bitcoin is and probably he's
[42:05] mining it in his backyard or in the old
[42:07] the Farms that he's bought or uh maybe
[42:11] he's buying it on some exchange under
[42:13] someone else's name I don't know he has
[42:16] the means to acquire it and I don't
[42:18] think he is honest in his criticism of
[42:20] Bitcoin interesting yeah like the
[42:23] the there are no in
[42:27] I've never met a really informed
[42:31] critic that is
[42:34] honest so like in my real life I never
[42:38] ever encountered an informed critic but
[42:42] there's like those internet
[42:43] personalities like a Peter shiff or like
[42:46] Bill Gates where I'm like okay like I I
[42:48] don't think they're totally honest with
[42:50] us uh they they probably understand
[42:52] Bitcoin way better and they probably
[42:54] have Bitcoin but in my real life I've
[42:57] never ever encountered someone that is
[43:01] against
[43:03] Bitcoin uh and uh uh understands Bitcoin
[43:08] if you understand
[43:10] Bitcoin you have to get some like even
[43:14] even if you don't like that future like
[43:17] even if you are
[43:19] philosophically or politically against
[43:22] sound money and the liberation of the
[43:26] state and stuff like that
[43:28] even if you are totally there and you
[43:31] understand Bitcoin you have to get some
[43:34] to protect yourself and your family like
[43:38] if you truly understand it and I think
[43:40] that's
[43:41] where the the power of Bitcoin comes in
[43:44] where even the biggest haters have a
[43:48] greater incentive to adopting it versus
[43:51] not adopting in they can still speak
[43:55] they can still hate on it but they can
[43:58] in private buy it and and and that's
[44:00] just game theoretically and and magical
[44:04] thing that Bitcoin succeeded with I'm
[44:08] still amazed after over 400 podcasts of
[44:11] in Bitcoin I'm still amazed about that
[44:13] one fact that that game theory is just
[44:15] so beautiful and and and is playing out
[44:18] in real time right now yeah definitely I
[44:21] can actually see I toi video on that
[44:23] that I mean I hadn't uh uh looked at it
[44:26] that way I was surprised in the
[44:29] beginning but when you finished uh
[44:32] explaining yourself I can say that I
[44:35] agree with you and in that few minutes
[44:38] you actually convinced me that even if
[44:39] you do not like that future for
[44:41] protecting yourself and your family you
[44:43] need to get some absolutely if you on if
[44:46] you have the knowled of of understanding
[44:48] it yeah really interesting uh you have
[44:51] been uh in Bitcoin since quite a while
[44:53] funny enough I asked uh jvd always about
[44:56] my my guest and like oh like what do you
[44:58] know about my guest what can I ask him
[45:01] what what is kind of the summary and Jud
[45:03] I don't know if the information is
[45:05] correct says that you are in Bitcoin
[45:06] since you are interested in Bitcoin
[45:08] since
[45:09] 2016 knows that wow yeah like honestly
[45:13] like you you you you type in your uh
[45:17] your name uh and I can maybe maybe I can
[45:20] actually share that with you wait I I'll
[45:22] I'll try to uh to quickly uh pull it up
[45:26] if I still have it but I can actually
[45:28] share that with you so first uh uh he
[45:32] gave me someone else and then is
[45:36] like invol in cultural projects such as
[45:40] I no this is someone else
[45:42] definitely but see like this is someone
[45:44] else and and then I was like okay is it
[45:47] the right one and I think now then he
[45:49] got it right this this should be you
[45:51] right and can yeah that is definitely me
[45:54] but can you go up again I think part it
[45:57] has gotten right with the name that I am
[46:00] known in Iran no architecture and
[46:03] translation translation is correct
[46:05] cultural analysis is correct and
[46:07] technology is kind of correct
[46:10] cultur but about the what kind of
[46:12] cultureal project and architecture it is
[46:14] totally wrong because I have not no
[46:17] information about them at
[46:19] all but I think it has translated
[46:22] something in per from Persian to English
[46:25] and it has gotten the correct
[46:27] person kind of mixed it up with someone
[46:29] else but but then it it also shows like
[46:31] his interest in Bitcoin began in 2016 oh
[46:34] my God that that's where that's where I
[46:35] got it
[46:40] from
[46:41] engaging so my God yeah like uh like uh
[46:45] open my eye I got
[46:48] you uh but but my question the question
[46:51] had actually nothing to do with AI and
[46:53] uh how he talks with you uh bitcoiner um
[46:58] but uh more of like what have you
[47:00] learned over the years uh around Bitcoin
[47:03] being so long in Bitcoin and also um
[47:07] maybe tapping into that what is now
[47:10] different what what do you see now
[47:12] different in this cycle compared to like
[47:14] maybe the the the last few ones uh do
[47:18] you do you have something around
[47:21] that so you kind of also want to know
[47:25] how Bitcoin has effect me knowing about
[47:28] Bitcoin has affected me is that what you
[47:30] mean yeah like there's two things I'm
[47:32] I'm asking I think actually two question
[47:34] maybe let's start with the first one
[47:36] what what you have learned along the way
[47:38] of being in those Cycles around Bitcoin
[47:41] and and and uh being in Bitcoin and the
[47:44] second question was like
[47:47] uh how is this cycle uh if it's
[47:51] different different from the the the
[47:54] other ones that you have seen it seems
[47:56] like there's a lot going on on nation
[47:58] states and institutional level that I've
[48:00] not seen in in previous
[48:04] Cycles yeah the first one yeah I can say
[48:08] that the things that I have learned from
[48:11] Bitcoin
[48:13] are it I have learned a lot of
[48:16] political uh it has changed my political
[48:19] views
[48:21] radically um I was very much of a list
[48:26] leftist on the brink of being a Marxist
[48:29] I have read the first uh book of the
[48:33] capital volume
[48:35] one um I had differences with Marx but I
[48:41] was sympathetic
[48:43] to uh Communists views and I also knew
[48:47] the value of freedom and I was trying to
[48:50] kind of keep these two ideas together
[48:54] freedom and I kind of you know equality
[48:57] the way uh Communists and leftist uh
[49:01] talk about it and
[49:04] then when I learned about Bitcoin and so
[49:08] much of this enlightening happened by
[49:10] listening to Jeff boo was that actually
[49:14] communism and anarchism and freedom and
[49:17] communism do not go together at all it's
[49:21] and you know you sometimes hear this
[49:23] term an anoc capitalism that most of us
[49:27] probably are or we are on the
[49:29] libertarian side and also an communism I
[49:34] sympathize with that a lot but then I
[49:37] realized that it's a kind of a axima
[49:40] that these two terms negate each other
[49:43] they cannot um happen at the same
[49:46] time uh I learned
[49:49] patience uh from Bitcoin and I also
[49:52] learned that there is no cheating the
[49:54] economy you cannot cheat it at all I
[49:57] come from a com a country that tries to
[50:01] control everything and tries to control
[50:04] the economy of
[50:06] course every government with the help of
[50:10] the their own version of Federal Reserve
[50:13] with their own Central Banking have
[50:15] control over the money but there is
[50:17] something that they cannot cheat they
[50:19] cannot cheat the
[50:21] economy uh this thought kind of sparked
[50:25] in my mind when a classmate of M who is
[50:27] from Zimbabwe he was telling me that
[50:30] after the
[50:31] inflation people were like um suddenly
[50:35] the government was like every uh bill of
[50:39] our country is equal to
[50:42] $1 so you get it to the bank you get
[50:45] equal in dollars but then they realize
[50:48] that they cannot redeem all the tokens
[50:51] that people tokens that are printed by
[50:53] themselves and they bring them there and
[50:56] they were like okay trade it between
[50:58] yourself as if it is a dollar but then
[51:01] there was famine you and my friend would
[51:05] uh tell us stories about Zimbabwe that
[51:08] you would go to the store to buy
[51:11] something something anything for example
[51:14] even get sugar and there was nothing
[51:17] even if you had the money there was
[51:18] nothing because no one is willing to
[51:22] sell anything even a pound of sugar for
[51:27] the worthless token that the government
[51:30] has made you cannot and he said that it
[51:33] is a way to cheat the economy that the
[51:34] government says that and then I realize
[51:37] how impossible it is to cheat the
[51:39] economy and if I uh kind of want to say
[51:43] something about change in
[51:45] Psychology I was kind of you know a
[51:48] critical thinker and that was something
[51:51] that got me into Bitcoin and before
[51:54] Bitcoin I became I became interested in
[51:57] carnivore diet so my diet is also much
[52:01] different from mainstream the
[52:03] interesting thing is that Bitcoin
[52:04] happened a bit before that but I wasn't
[52:06] a bitcoiner I knew Bitcoin in 2016 I had
[52:10] Bitcoin in
[52:12] 2016 and don't come after me I didn't
[52:15] get 1,000 Bitcoin there in that cheap
[52:18] price so but I didn't become a bitcoiner
[52:22] until I had I listened to that interview
[52:26] with safein Shan Baker and safein which
[52:28] was a carnivore podcast Dr sha Baker was
[52:31] talking to safe and I checked a couple
[52:34] of times am I listening to the same
[52:35] Carnival podcast and I was like yeah am
[52:38] interested in that in the beginning of
[52:40] that Dr Baker spoke so it is the same
[52:42] podcast and the discussion is something
[52:44] that I like let's listen to it that
[52:45] changed my world a
[52:47] lot and um so it also made me think
[52:53] critically about everything
[52:57] things that I had thought critically
[53:00] about and things that are yet to come I
[53:03] am always like that I have this kind of
[53:06] thin tin foil hat and it has made me a
[53:08] kind of conspiracy theorist as people
[53:11] has uh tell us but it turns out that we
[53:15] weren't much wrong we weren't wrong
[53:16] about the money we weren't wrong about
[53:18] the diet and how
[53:20] about uh about other things that we have
[53:24] some other views maybe we are right
[53:26] about them too and most of the people
[53:28] what the mainstream media is talking
[53:30] about is not right and it has made me
[53:32] much more
[53:34] patient uh about your second part of the
[53:37] question I am not the person to ask you
[53:40] know I think you have asked rusbe and
[53:42] Cena is a great person to ask about the
[53:46] price aspect of
[53:48] things um but I think the kind of
[53:51] volatility over psych over and over
[53:54] these are the things that I have learned
[53:55] from Cena for for
[53:57] example um they are becoming less and
[54:01] less compared to other Cycles as Bitcoin
[54:05] matures but when I look at how many
[54:08] people have adopted Bitcoin it was a
[54:12] kind of statistic from several years ago
[54:14] I heard it from Alex
[54:16] gladstein that 2% of the world are using
[54:19] Bitcoin maybe they use them for
[54:21] transferring money maybe they are using
[54:23] them on binance to uh trade and do their
[54:27] own shed coining but that is 2% of the
[54:30] people and Bitcoin at this rate has
[54:35] reached
[54:36] $1,000 per coin a bit less than that but
[54:40] around that and it has been above that
[54:42] for some time too and this is happening
[54:46] with 2% of the world maybe it has uh
[54:51] become more maybe the percentage has
[54:53] changed maybe it has become 3% maybe it
[54:55] has become
[54:57] 4% let's be so much optimistic and say
[55:01] 5% of people know Bitcoin and use
[55:03] Bitcoin in fact uh still knowing that we
[55:09] have 95% to go and seeing that I am in a
[55:12] world in a on a kind of protocol that is
[55:15] run by Bitcoin and I am working for a
[55:17] company that helps people self- custody
[55:20] Bitcoin I can say that even with the low
[55:24] uh volatility we have a very long way to
[55:28] go and there is so much value to be
[55:31] gained and there is so much growth that
[55:34] we are going to see how much is going to
[55:37] happen is it going to you know is the
[55:40] this uh cycle going to be bullish which
[55:43] between you and me I think I want the
[55:46] price to drop a bit more like the other
[55:48] years so we have sometime to stack some
[55:51] cheaper
[55:52] stats um but
[55:56] maybe it's is it's a cycle that has you
[56:01] know a kind of damped be Market but I
[56:06] really don't know but what I know is
[56:08] that we have a
[56:11] lot there's a lot of value that can pour
[56:14] into Bitcoin and we are just in the
[56:17] beginning absolutely and and I love uh
[56:21] how you said with the conspiracy
[56:22] theories is like sometimes and you had
[56:25] this with every technology that's that
[56:28] is
[56:28] disruptive you have people that see a
[56:31] thing very early on and they getting
[56:35] called out by the mainstream because it
[56:38] challenges the current status of how
[56:40] things are done and so what is happening
[56:44] is we are not wrong we just right too
[56:49] soon uh and all the things that we are
[56:51] saying about Bitcoin will be no prer in
[56:55] probably 50 to 100 years but now it's
[56:58] super early uh and and we are kind of uh
[57:03] looking into a technology that uh is
[57:06] still very very young uh
[57:09] so we are probably not wrong we probably
[57:12] just right way too soon yeah too too too
[57:15] early and it's going to even surprise us
[57:18] we are talking about hyperbitcoinization
[57:20] the future that Bitcoin is becoming the
[57:23] current the common language of us all
[57:26] And yet when the price goes up we are
[57:29] like whoa whoa why did it happen so fast
[57:31] why did it happen so quickly uh when I
[57:34] woke up to$
[57:36] 100,000 per coin I was like with Cena
[57:39] and Rus we were talking about this that
[57:41] yeah ETFs are kind of opening the gates
[57:45] for influx of money from traditional
[57:48] institutions into Bitcoin and
[57:50] institutions that couldn't do it before
[57:52] they can come into Bitcoin
[57:54] now so I because of the kind of approach
[57:57] they have it's going to we are going to
[57:59] have less volatile and less um kind of
[58:05] uh abrupt uh Cuts in the price and falls
[58:08] in the price we were saying all these
[58:11] things and we were saying that yeah
[58:12] Bitcoin can reach this price that
[58:15] price it was
[58:18] around 20,000 or
[58:21] $25,000 when we were saying these things
[58:24] and we couldn't imagine that this
[58:28] quickly all this is going to happen and
[58:31] it's going to go four times higher than
[58:35] that in a matter of months we were
[58:38] talking about the same price though this
[58:41] that price when it was in front of us we
[58:43] were like whoa what did just happen and
[58:46] we are talking when we are talking about
[58:48] hyperbitcoinization it is infinity
[58:51] divided by 21 million and even less
[58:56] and I am sure when Bitcoin reaches
[58:59] 500,000 uh 500k when it uh reaches 1
[59:03] million you and I who are talking about
[59:07] hyperbitcoinization like crazy people
[59:09] and everyone is like oh these are just
[59:11] some crazy guys talking about uh Bitcoin
[59:14] and are too optimistic they are too
[59:17] naive that they will come and you and I
[59:20] would be also surprised I do think
[59:22] so what do you think the impact of that
[59:26] will be on society uh like where where's
[59:29] Bitcoin taking us from from a human
[59:32] standpoint we are not stuck in the rat
[59:35] race anymore you know apart from uh my
[59:39] all my efforts in 21st capital I have a
[59:42] Fiat job and before that I had a even
[59:45] lower paying Fiat job that I was doing
[59:49] alongside my podcast which was in the
[59:53] beginning not even about Bitcoin because
[59:54] I hadn't become a Bitcoin ER as I said I
[59:57] was I knew Bitcoin in 2016 but I didn't
[60:00] become a bitcoiner up until um 2021 or
[60:04] so or
[60:07] 2020
[60:09] uh it
[60:11] was uh my job was hard I can say my Fiat
[60:15] job is still uh difficult better than
[60:18] before
[60:19] but when I know that when I can save a
[60:24] small portion of my money into Bitcoin
[60:28] it's going to be worthwhile even if it
[60:32] this job is so difficult even if the
[60:34] money that I am going to be able to save
[60:37] is really small it's going to be worth
[60:41] it and I have proven myself right in
[60:44] those years that I could you know save a
[60:47] very small amount of money in
[60:52] Bitcoin and some rate of it would be
[60:54] lost on
[60:57] kind of the convergence to the USD or
[61:00] Euro and then I would get small amount
[61:03] of Bitcoin and then there were so many
[61:05] small
[61:07] utxos now it has paid off and it's hope
[61:13] it gets you out of the Rat Race and I
[61:16] could focus on what I love to and
[61:19] hopefully very soon I am thinking about
[61:21] it very soon maybe in a matter of month
[61:25] I'm going to be all and all and all
[61:28] Bitcoin and my job is going to be from
[61:32] the time that I wake up Bitcoin till the
[61:34] time that I go to sleep and of course
[61:38] dream Bitcoin to be bitcoiners I I can
[61:41] speak from experience uh it's it's
[61:43] really cool uh I've made that jump last
[61:45] year in March and ever since I'm fully
[61:48] focused only on bitcoin and I only talk
[61:51] about Bitcoin um I do have a life
[61:54] outside of Bitcoin but it's very
[61:57] small uh and like 95% of my life is is
[62:01] is Bitcoin and the other things are uh
[62:04] uh yeah my girlfriend my family uh and
[62:07] other things like that but even here
[62:09] there's a lot of Bitcoin involved
[62:10] because we talk about Bitcoin uh my
[62:13] family also stores their Val have orange
[62:16] your girlfriend too of course she's
[62:19] saving uh Bitcoin already like she's
[62:22] already saving her money in Bitcoin
[62:24] everything she has left over uh so that
[62:27] that's that's great it was actually not
[62:29] it was actually not the case when I
[62:30] started the podcast when I started the
[62:32] podcast she was not orange build and now
[62:34] after let's say 13 14 months still I
[62:38] have the podcast she's actually orange
[62:39] build uh and that's that that's really
[62:42] great to to see but I never pushed it on
[62:44] her you know like I I I I was just there
[62:48] and spoke about Bitcoin uh but it was
[62:51] always saying like it's okay if you
[62:53] don't have Bitcoin like it's not it for
[62:56] me it's not a requirement for a
[62:58] relationship because I knew she will get
[63:01] it anyways like it's just a matter of
[63:03] time and it's it's healthier for the
[63:06] relationship and it's healthier for her
[63:08] uh that I let her Discover it herself
[63:13] and not push it on her and yeah this
[63:15] happens uh this happened the past year
[63:18] where she just discovered Bitcoin uh
[63:21] because there is a weird Bitcoin guy
[63:23] sleeping next to her
[63:26] in in in that way yeah in my case I also
[63:29] didn't uh push it on my your friend but
[63:33] she's very curious she's very
[63:35] open-minded and I can say that she's one
[63:37] of the smartest people that I have seen
[63:39] in my life and some of the things that
[63:41] come to my own mind some of the
[63:44] questions comes to her mind so uh
[63:47] quickly and some of the answers she gets
[63:49] so quickly or maybe I am very a very
[63:52] good explainer of things after you know
[63:56] thanks to doing Bitcoin education and
[63:58] making all these clips and all these
[64:00] conversations I don't know which one it
[64:02] is but to be honest can both can be true
[64:05] at the same time yeah both can be true
[64:07] and when I compare her objective
[64:10] objectively to other people that I am
[64:12] also talking to about Bitcoin I can see
[64:14] how easily she gets it and I really
[64:18] didn't from the first month that we were
[64:21] together she became convinced of getting
[64:24] Bitcoin and cut posting Bitcoin and when
[64:27] I explained her how you can transfer
[64:29] money from your exchange to your wallet
[64:32] without saying that it is important to
[64:34] self custody your
[64:36] Bitcoin and I was trying to start that
[64:40] conversation that you know there are
[64:42] some people who hold their Bitcoin on
[64:45] the exchange and I was going to say it
[64:48] is bad because the key is not uh in
[64:51] their hands uh in their own control and
[64:53] she was like why would anyone keep the
[64:55] their money on the exchange it was
[64:57] already a kind of solv dilemma for for
[65:00] her it wasn't like that oh I am afraid
[65:02] of losing these 12 Wars I am afraid of
[65:04] losing this 24 Wars or and this wallet
[65:08] or that wallet um it wasn't the kind of
[65:11] question for
[65:12] her uh yeah from the very early months
[65:15] she could get it objectively compared to
[65:17] other people very much quicker really
[65:20] cool that that's that's great um Coming
[65:23] uh to the closer to the end of the
[65:25] podcast I have one question that I ask
[65:27] each and every one of my guests and the
[65:29] question is what can we learn from you
[65:31] besides Bitcoin very
[65:35] little but uh yeah besides
[65:40] Bitcoin you
[65:42] can learn learn things about the
[65:46] carnivore diet from
[65:48] me
[65:49] and about Fitness a little bit but more
[65:52] about carnivore
[65:54] diet yeah yeah these are the things that
[65:56] you
[65:57] can I love I love that it's like Fitness
[66:00] diet and family usually comes up in in
[66:03] those talks there sometimes other things
[66:04] also but like usually those things
[66:06] really cool um we have an end routine in
[66:08] the podcast where the previous guest is
[66:10] asking a question for the next guest
[66:12] without knowing who the next guest
[66:14] actually is and the question from the
[66:15] previous guest is which will be the
[66:18] country with the biggest Bitcoin
[66:20] circular economy in 15 years in 15 years
[66:25] it's going to one of these
[66:27] probably uh poorest countries oh it's a
[66:32] difficult question to ask to answer in
[66:35] fact which I think it's an impossible
[66:37] it's an impossible one to to know but
[66:40] it's a fun one to speculate yeah yeah I
[66:42] I I like that um thought experiment and
[66:45] you know kind of thought
[66:49] exercise which country would it
[66:53] be uh I sometimes ago I interviewed Paul
[66:57] King from
[66:59] Primal and he lives in Costa
[67:02] Rica and though we hear about Bitcoin
[67:06] becoming tax-free in Czech Republic
[67:09] after you hold it for 3 years where you
[67:12] live after 2 years it becomes tax-free
[67:16] um there are some some of these
[67:18] advantages here and there El Salvador is
[67:21] known as the Bitcoin uh country and N bu
[67:25] has not yet issued his own meme coin
[67:29] thankfully maybe if you asked me some
[67:32] months ago or some weeks ago even I
[67:35] would have been very optimistic about
[67:38] Argentina but with the last move from
[67:41] Kier he broke my heart and I don't
[67:46] know
[67:47] but I think Costa Rica was a very
[67:51] unexpected country that no one talks
[67:54] about
[67:56] and people are free to accept any kind
[67:58] of payment a percentage of their payment
[68:01] they can get in bit in any kind of
[68:04] currency they of they're choosing and
[68:06] because of that Bitcoin is very common
[68:08] there and there is this place this town
[68:11] Bitcoin jungle where Bitcoin is uh
[68:16] used uh my guess is going to be let me
[68:20] put my money based on what I know now
