[00:00] Bitcoin just went yesterday from
[00:03] 541 billion US market capitalization to
[00:08] $563 billion of market capitalization
[00:13] this is more than $22 billion of market
[00:17] capitalization increase in less than 2
[00:20] hours for Bitcoin and this only because
[00:24] of fake news of a Bitcoin spot ETF now I
[00:27] wonder what could have happened if the
[00:30] news were actually true what will happen
[00:33] if this will be approved in the near
[00:36] future but first of all what happened
[00:38] coin dgraph reported on Twitter breaking
[00:41] SSC approves I shares Bitcoin spot ETF
[00:46] and only because of this news the
[00:48] Bitcoin price went up
[00:51] 67% but before we dive deeper into what
[00:54] can happen for Bitcoin in the future if
[00:57] this happens let's hear what Larry think
[00:59] has to say this rally is Way Beyond the
[01:02] rumor I think the the rally today is
[01:04] about a flight to Quality very
[01:06] interesting Larry think defends Bitcoin
[01:09] and he's not only saying Bitcoin is good
[01:11] he's also saying this this rally is not
[01:15] because of the fake news or the rumors
[01:18] about the spot Bitcoin EDF it's because
[01:20] of a flight to Quality and I totally
[01:23] agree with him actually I never heard
[01:25] the phrase fly to Quality but it's a
[01:27] really really good one because everybody
[01:30] pain is rising and rising and Rising
[01:32] with the inflation with fear with
[01:34] everything going on in the world and
[01:35] Bitcoin is the one asset you can rely on
[01:39] right now this is the quality people are
[01:41] searching for this is the quality people
[01:43] are not getting anywhere else this is
[01:47] why we have a
[01:48] 70% upwards move since the year started
[01:53] in Bitcoin we are clearly in the early
[01:55] stages of a major bull market a few
[01:59] other really interesting things we are
[02:01] now since July above 50% Bitcoin
[02:05] dominance with a few small dips but in
[02:07] general we are 50 51 52% dominance
[02:11] against all the other all coins if you
[02:14] exclude all those stable coins then we
[02:17] are like at 60 70% already but there's
[02:20] one thing that just came up that's
[02:22] actually really really interesting to
[02:24] see since ethereum switched from proof
[02:27] of work to a proof of stake model it
[02:30] went down
[02:31] 33% against Bitcoin this clearly shows
[02:35] that the flight to Quality as Larry
[02:38] think said is actually happening but to
[02:41] sum it all up that can actually be a god
[02:44] candle that's coming up soon as Bitcoin
[02:47] spot ETF would trigger the market really
[02:51] really heavily we saw that with the fake
[02:53] rumors yesterday this was the small test
[02:57] how can a market react to it and when
[02:59] the actual thing happen buckle up but
[03:01] also on another note I really don't care
[03:04] about the price action it's fun to talk
[03:06] about it is really entertaining but in
[03:08] the end of the day I have my DCA plan
[03:10] and this is just going to keep going I
[03:13] care about the long-term vision for
[03:15] Bitcoin shortterm everything can happen
[03:17] maybe we are now on a downwards strend
[03:19] for a year or two years I don't think
[03:22] that's probable but it can happen and
[03:24] even if it goes up like crazy my DCA
[03:26] plan is just working there's no need to
[03:29] dat trade Bitcoin just keep on buying
[03:33] DCA and you will win in the long term
[03:35] but as always Tik Tok next block I see
[03:38] you in the next one bye-bye
