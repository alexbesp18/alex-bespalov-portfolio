[00:00] the first person I interviewed who was
[00:01] kind of forced to learn about Bitcoin
[00:04] initially a one person in India can earn
[00:06] and then the whole family was able to
[00:08] survive now two people are working but
[00:10] still you know uh it's not enough I
[00:13] don't care even if you buy even a single
[00:15] dollar or rupees whatever right but
[00:17] please study it like put in at least 10
[00:19] hours 20 hours read this book the
[00:21] Bitcoin stand and the first time in the
[00:23] history I see if a company is doing well
[00:25] in their stocks they issue more stocks
[00:27] if a builder is doing good in his real
[00:29] estate he will build more buildings
[00:31] everybody matches the demand your only
[00:34] concern is not to make money your main
[00:36] concern is to how to save your money
[00:38] it's not like Bitcoin is now coming in
[00:40] this great system it's the other way
[00:42] around big boys money they realize they
[00:44] have to join that's so hard because
[00:46] frankly I get scared just thinking what
[00:49] if there was no
[00:51] Bitcoin
[00:54] Namaste that's like hello hello other
[00:58] like I actually have a since around a
[01:01] year an Indian girlfriend so that's why
[01:03] I know a little bit Hindi like she
[01:06] speaks Hindi uh but not a lot like I
[01:10] have I have to be so much better and I
[01:13] actually like you my first Indian guest
[01:15] and I actually asked her do you have
[01:18] because it's an Indian guest do you have
[01:20] a special question for him and I would
[01:22] actually like to start with that
[01:23] question from her because it's an
[01:25] interesting one um if you're close to
[01:28] your parents how did they react when
[01:30] they came to know that you are into
[01:32] Bitcoin um so so my journey to bitcoin
[01:35] was very different my journey to bitcoin
[01:38] was my I so I'll just give it a little
[01:41] bit background so yeah I went to United
[01:43] States uh 2015 uh for my masters from
[01:47] India um and then when I was doing my
[01:49] masters I was just about to graduate it
[01:51] was my last semester and one of my
[01:54] professor uh he was also from India but
[01:57] he was teaching there since quite a few
[01:59] years is Dr wasant Rael and he told me
[02:03] like hey you know what uh this is your
[02:05] last semester this class and you will be
[02:08] graduate so maybe you know with the
[02:10] final exam also write a paper on bitcoin
[02:13] and blockchain and I had zero idea it
[02:17] was 2017 of August or something no sorry
[02:21] May or June and I had like zero idea
[02:24] like what is he even talking about like
[02:25] Bitcoin and blockchain what is it I I
[02:28] never heard about it before
[02:30] and I'm like I need grades I need to
[02:32] pass the class and I was like okay I'll
[02:34] write it and the first thing I went was
[02:36] went to YouTube and back then there was
[02:40] hardly any podcast or anything so I
[02:42] looked at the tedex talk and there was
[02:45] one FBI officer talking about how
[02:47] Bitcoin is so useful for them because
[02:50] they can easily track people now and
[02:53] there was one other like two three tedex
[02:55] stocks and so that's how my journey
[02:59] started and so that's why when I you
[03:02] know say my parents that hey my
[03:04] professor gave me the paper he
[03:06] introduced me to something like this and
[03:08] he has a track record of being very
[03:11] updated in the like world like what's
[03:13] going on and they were like okay so I
[03:16] mean they never never mention like hey
[03:20] you know why are you doing this or why
[03:21] are you so interested in this they
[03:24] sometimes get concerned like if I the
[03:27] Indian parents I think they always say
[03:28] don't get too obsessed with something
[03:30] like be be humble like that's what
[03:32] Bitcoin teaches me like don't be too
[03:35] much and don't be like too aggressive
[03:38] just see both the sides and that's what
[03:40] I did uh for me uh I I remember when I
[03:44] was writing the paper I it was some I
[03:48] don't even remember the dollar amount
[03:49] but $2,000 or something but I only
[03:52] bought like $10 because again you are
[03:55] student I was about to graduate no job
[03:58] right so I was like
[04:00] okay let's put the $10 let's start like
[04:02] just to check that was my first purchase
[04:05] on coinbase and I'm like and and then
[04:08] you know what like after the paper was
[04:09] done I I I wrote it and the the
[04:13] professor he didn't like the paper at
[04:15] all like what I wrote so he gave me
[04:17] again like hey you know what I'll give
[04:19] you 10 more days fix lot of the remarks
[04:22] he gave because I wrote all kind of
[04:25] stuff like I have no idea like I just
[04:28] wrote oh it's decentralized it's like
[04:30] uber where you know there's no one owner
[04:33] like I was writing like I even when I
[04:35] read that paper now I'm like I always
[04:39] laugh on it like I'll never show that
[04:40] paper to anyone so so yeah I mean and
[04:44] then i' uh completely I I started my job
[04:47] uh at deoe as a financial auditor uh as
[04:50] an external Financial auditor and
[04:53] frankly you know when you go to a new
[04:55] country uh you start a job it's very
[04:57] hard to get a job and then you they
[04:59] sponsor the visa for you and also so I
[05:01] was very much dedicated to work and I'm
[05:04] like I can't do like I forgot about
[05:06] Bitcoin like like literally and thank
[05:09] God or else I would have bought the top
[05:11] or something like I would have gone
[05:12] crazy right so it was a bull market
[05:15] right about it and I forgot about it and
[05:17] then I think in 2019 is when you know I
[05:22] somehow on YouTube there was a podcast
[05:25] or something which popped up and they
[05:27] were talking about Bitcoin and I'm like
[05:30] oh yeah like why like let's see what's
[05:34] going on and that's you know that's how
[05:36] I started reading about it I read the
[05:38] books I started year like listening to
[05:41] podcast uh thousands of hours like again
[05:44] after sailor joined I think 2020 I've
[05:47] been listening to sailor what Bitcoin
[05:49] did like again so much stuff and that's
[05:53] how like the entire Journey started and
[05:55] I'm very fortunate that you know uh I
[05:58] started from a research part and not
[06:01] like a buying part but still you know
[06:04] what I I ended up going into other
[06:08] cryptos and uh I don't know why I did
[06:11] that I uh it was like no let's try
[06:15] ethereum let's try cardano let's try
[06:17] this let's try decentral land oh let's
[06:20] try again I was so I don't know why it
[06:23] maybe it's a part of every bitcoiners
[06:25] journey I think it's a I think I think
[06:27] it's a learning curve like I also was in
[06:29] De central line there already also blade
[06:31] in there I was in ethereum I was in in a
[06:35] lot of shitcoins I think it's just a
[06:36] part of the the The Learning Journey of
[06:39] of of being a bitcoiner to get some some
[06:43] experience in altcoins also it's but
[06:45] it's interesting you were the first
[06:47] person I interviewed who was kind of
[06:49] forced to learn about
[06:51] Bitcoin an
[06:53] interesting jokingly like you know
[06:56] that's the best of my masters like that
[06:58] was the best part that uh he asked me to
[07:01] write a paper I'm so happy like I even
[07:05] told him later on
[07:07] like like thank you for introducing me
[07:10] he's he's no more in this world uh his
[07:13] soul rest in peace but yeah he uh he was
[07:17] very nice Professor he was from India he
[07:20] connected with me and I don't know why
[07:23] he just gave me that paper and if that
[07:25] was not like I think if he would have
[07:27] not given it I don't think so I would
[07:29] have even thought about getting into
[07:31] this uh I would have been you know just
[07:34] be into stocks or something like that
[07:36] like you know like some because again I
[07:39] would have never like I don't know I
[07:42] would have not put my money because I
[07:44] again I take my personal wealth very
[07:46] seriously and I would have like I would
[07:48] have thought like as 99% of world today
[07:51] thinks it's just a gamble uh it's you
[07:54] know it's there's no utility to it but
[07:58] to him do you know if your pro Professor
[08:01] was like a bitcoiner or in the crypto
[08:03] scene but like why did he propose that
[08:05] topic again like I don't know if he was
[08:07] a Bitcoin or not because if he would
[08:09] have been a Bitcoin like again what's
[08:11] the trait of Bitcoin talking nonstop
[08:13] right about
[08:14] Bitcoin we were in the class I was a
[08:16] student so I don't think so uh he I
[08:19] don't know and I never asked him that
[08:21] time but I'm pretty sure that if but
[08:23] again one thing unique about him was he
[08:27] always was curious what's going on
[08:29] what's going on with the technology and
[08:31] I think it was about the bull market
[08:33] 2017 so you know he might have heard in
[08:35] the news or something and he would have
[08:38] understood that blockchain is a future
[08:41] uh and Bitcoin is the future and but
[08:44] again he told me to write specifically
[08:46] on bitcoin and blockchain like he didn't
[08:49] even s me like cryptocurrency like
[08:51] nothing like he just said Bitcoin and
[08:54] blockchain and that's all and again uh
[08:58] uh I forgot about it but thanks to him
[09:01] that I was able to when I went in and
[09:04] started reading about Bitcoin went into
[09:06] that rabbito I think thanks to him that
[09:09] I was like so confident because it was
[09:12] my professor who gave me because he has
[09:14] a really good track record and he won't
[09:17] show me something you know which is
[09:19] irrelevant or a scam right so thanks to
[09:22] him I didn't even I never had doubt in
[09:26] my mind that you know oh Bitcoin you
[09:28] know my p a scam or something I never
[09:30] had that so that's the most because lot
[09:33] of the bitcoiners I here they say that
[09:35] they avoided Bitcoin at the first place
[09:37] and then they thought it's a scam
[09:39] internet money and then they joined but
[09:41] with me I think it was uh a research I
[09:44] wanted a good grade so that's that's
[09:47] really fortunate like you you can be
[09:49] really thankful for that Professor I
[09:51] thought that Bitcoin is a scam for a
[09:53] long time I actually wanted to prove a
[09:57] friend of mine who was in into Bitcoin
[10:00] or like even wanted to ask me what is
[10:02] bitcoin and what do you think about it
[10:03] and I want to prove him wrong and I was
[10:06] like this weekend I will learn
[10:08] everything about Bitcoin and I will
[10:09] prove you wrong why Bitcoin is a scam
[10:12] and in that weekend I discovered Bitcoin
[10:14] and I bought the Monday afterwards like
[10:17] I needed to overcome my ego to learn
[10:19] about Bitcoin because I was so convinced
[10:21] that it's a scam but I think it's it's
[10:24] easier if you're going with an open mind
[10:27] in there I was not
[10:30] um I saw your first post uh with like
[10:33] your PIN post I think it already is uh
[10:35] on X where you saw see where you say
[10:38] that there are no Bitcoin only exchanges
[10:41] in India like for me it's fascinating
[10:44] because Austria Austria has like eight
[10:47] million people uh India has like 1.4
[10:51] billion and Austria alone I know free
[10:55] Bitcoin only
[10:56] exchanges uh and like how is the Bitcoin
[11:00] adoption India going uh can you talk
[11:03] about like why are there no Bitcoin only
[11:05] exchanges how is the the process of
[11:08] Bitcoin in India right now so so yeah as
[11:11] I said right like uh I spent eight years
[11:14] in United States and like I was always
[11:17] there like even when I was started with
[11:19] Bitcoin so I had that option to sign up
[11:22] with coinbase Robin Hood stuff like that
[11:25] and in India a lot of my friends were in
[11:27] India right like and I was telling them
[11:29] hey Bitcoin and all but they were like
[11:32] where do I buy it because in India I I
[11:34] just want to give you a background that
[11:36] Indian in India uh from 2017 to 2019 or
[11:41] 2020 I might be wrong but uh it was the
[11:45] they they had a lawsuit or something
[11:47] sorry sorry they were banned and then in
[11:50] 2020 20 and then I think crypto
[11:52] exchanges uh uh few of the people who
[11:55] were ogs who were in the in the field
[11:58] since 20
[11:59] 20112 they went to Supreme Court filed
[12:02] the case and they won the case and
[12:04] that's how you know the exchanges were
[12:06] allowed again to operate I think it was
[12:09] 2019 or 2020 something like that so that
[12:11] was the journey and and my friends were
[12:14] aware about it because you know they
[12:15] were like how do I even buy there's
[12:18] nothing here and then you know even when
[12:20] the bull market came I was telling them
[12:23] go to a Bitcoin only exchange or you
[12:26] know try to buy uh an then withdraw like
[12:30] self- custody immediately like you know
[12:32] something like that uh because again
[12:34] even and then for them as well I think
[12:37] they
[12:38] had I don't know like they just said
[12:41] like there's hardly any exchanges who
[12:43] are allowing withdrawals or stuff like
[12:45] that it was very early in India for then
[12:48] like you know it was just buy and sell
[12:50] there were there are few exchanges in
[12:52] India who were allowing withdrawals but
[12:54] again we everyone was not even aware
[12:57] about them and stuff like that and uh
[13:00] but yeah when I see I took interest in
[13:03] India market since I think last one year
[13:06] like what's going on in India like you
[13:08] know in America there's so much stuff
[13:10] going on in America we have uh publicly
[13:13] listed exchanges publicly listed mining
[13:15] companies there are Bitcoin advisors
[13:18] there's a lot of stuff like what's
[13:19] happening in India and in India I think
[13:22] the when I started researching there was
[13:24] no Bitcoin only compan who are Bitcoin
[13:27] only who are trying to just sell Bitcoin
[13:30] and you know they allow withdrawals
[13:32] there's no issues in withdrawing and all
[13:36] but there are still some exchanges in
[13:38] India uh where withdrawals are still not
[13:41] allowed and you know it's very hard for
[13:44] folks to even withdraw like and lot of
[13:47] the folks in India as well when I see
[13:49] they say them themselves like they are
[13:51] crypto investors but uh not just Bitcoin
[13:55] like lot of stuff like other stuff is
[13:57] also going on here so it's it's it's at
[14:00] a very early stage here and I but I I
[14:03] had a chance to meet a lot of the
[14:05] bitcoiners in India now um I was uh I
[14:08] went to a group and you know joined that
[14:10] group and there's a show called I don't
[14:13] know on Twitter you even talked with
[14:15] harshan right like he makes me they are
[14:18] all part of a group called Dy Bitcoin
[14:20] show and I just was fortunate I found
[14:23] them on Twitter and uh I joined it and I
[14:27] met quite a few talented folks there
[14:29] like who are who have understood like
[14:31] why we want Bitcoin only they had their
[14:34] own Journey similar to us and uh and
[14:37] then when I met them like I talked with
[14:40] them now I know there are some companies
[14:43] which are Bitcoin only but they are at a
[14:45] very early stage like 90% of 99% of
[14:49] India don't even know them yet it's it's
[14:51] fun Bitcoin only like uh the I I think
[14:55] the Space is really evolving since like
[14:57] the last three to four years where
[15:00] Bitcoin only exchanges coming out uh VCS
[15:04] even uh that have Bitcoin only as focus
[15:06] and they know they they don't want any
[15:08] of the cryptos and you also told me that
[15:12] you have a podcast or you want to start
[15:13] a podcast uh it's Al about Bitcoin only
[15:18] um why are you doing that like for me
[15:19] it's always interesting to know that
[15:21] bitcoiners even though they usually
[15:24] don't get paid to make content they
[15:26] still do it like they cannot shut up
[15:28] about Bitcoin and they have sometimes
[15:30] unique reasons like why are you so
[15:33] passionate about Bitcoin that you talk
[15:34] about it that you educate other people
[15:36] about
[15:38] it yeah so I think that's an interesting
[15:43] question why Bitcoin is stop not stop
[15:46] about Bitcoin like what are we gaining
[15:48] here um for me I think when I started
[15:51] going into the rabit hoal I was like I
[15:54] was not asking for like what is Bitcoin
[15:59] I was asking more like why Bitcoin like
[16:02] why do I even need this what's the issue
[16:05] like why do I need Bitcoin in my life
[16:07] and and that's where I went into that
[16:09] rapital like how our current monetary
[16:11] system works how our you know uh I was
[16:15] seeing people getting a lot of debts and
[16:18] like the debts doesn't get over like
[16:20] it's uh like initially a one person in
[16:24] India can earn and then the whole family
[16:26] was able to survive now two people are
[16:29] working but still you know uh it's not
[16:32] enough and you know uh there are there
[16:35] are some like huge Debs and you know
[16:38] it's hard to take that off and I'm like
[16:41] okay then I went into it like what's
[16:42] happening here and then literally I'm an
[16:45] accounting student I did Masters in
[16:47] Accounting in us and I still didn't knew
[16:50] how money works because frankly I never
[16:54] studied about it in any curriculum
[16:56] activity there are quite a few friends
[16:58] who are charted accountants that's like
[17:00] CPA in America so charted accountants in
[17:02] India I asked them like is that
[17:05] something you guys are aware like how
[17:07] money is printed how how the entire
[17:10] system works you know how monetary
[17:13] system works how debt Works how like GDP
[17:17] Works how everything like how banking
[17:22] work and it was shocking not many were
[17:25] aware about it and I don't know that's
[17:27] something was not talk to us in
[17:29] curriculum activities in school and
[17:31] colleges uh which I'm very upset about
[17:35] like why didn't I knew this 10 years ago
[17:37] like this is something should be taught
[17:38] like and I think that's why we can't
[17:42] stop talking about it because we
[17:46] saw why Bitcoin is needed like you know
[17:49] we try to because again we can just shut
[17:52] up hold it and let the world catch up we
[17:56] can just relax till then I think we have
[17:58] that urge to talk about it to other
[18:01] people and especially our loved ones
[18:03] like hey you know what study it I don't
[18:06] care I I always say them I don't care
[18:08] even if you buy even a single dollar or
[18:11] rupees whatever right but please study
[18:14] it like put in at least 10 hours 20
[18:17] hours read this book the Bitcoin
[18:18] standard at least read that book and um
[18:22] that's my whole part like and I think
[18:24] that's why I think bitcoiners can't stop
[18:26] talking because we see
[18:28] why it is so needed and we see that if
[18:32] if folks don't have it's like a
[18:34] insurance right like and if they don't
[18:36] have it I think it will
[18:38] be uh it's it's a worry situation so
[18:43] yeah it can be really like um I have
[18:47] guests all over the world on and it's
[18:48] interesting to see a guest from
[18:50] Australia last time I had someone from
[18:52] Africa on and it's it's interesting to
[18:55] see that there all over the world the
[18:58] same problem it's just with different
[19:00] degrees and I think you would appreciate
[19:02] because you're in in America where
[19:03] basically they have the world currency
[19:05] right now but you also have a good
[19:07] connection with with India where I can
[19:10] imagine even though I never was there
[19:12] the financial system is quite different
[19:15] to the American one um like actually how
[19:19] different uh is it like do do you what
[19:22] what are the different uh differences
[19:24] from the financial aspect maybe not even
[19:26] Bitcoin like from just the pure uh uh
[19:30] what's in America possible what's in
[19:32] India possible where are the advantages
[19:35] and disadvantages the fin the financial
[19:37] system uh what do you see as a
[19:39] difference between those uh huge
[19:43] States yeah I think I think for India I
[19:46] see like it's a developing country right
[19:48] like we got independence in 1947 it's
[19:51] less than like again 80 years right like
[19:54] it's it's very early stage and uh it's a
[19:57] developing country it's huge potential
[19:59] here in India and I think India stands
[20:01] at a very strong power right now because
[20:04] world is watching like you know India
[20:06] has the most uh people who can speak
[20:08] English you know who has uh good uh
[20:12] population in young young age you know
[20:15] so I see India as a huge potential
[20:18] however I think when you talk about the
[20:20] monetary issue I think it's it's the
[20:23] same like wherever in every country
[20:25] where there is fiia right like it's the
[20:27] same way it works
[20:28] same way money printing happens same way
[20:31] the debts occur but it's just the
[20:33] difference in the ratio how fast and I
[20:37] think India is better in that way like
[20:39] it's not going like crazy if you see the
[20:41] GDP to debt ratio in America it's 34
[20:45] trillion debt 27 GDP however in India
[20:47] it's 4 trillion I think GDP but debt is
[20:51] like still lower than the GDP it's not
[20:53] like higher and I think but one thing
[20:57] which I was always is constantly
[20:59] thinking about like why is dollar rate
[21:02] you know becoming more stronger and
[21:03] stronger against in because INR I
[21:06] remember when I went I think to us in
[21:09] 2015 it was 60 62 and then now it's 83
[21:15] for one $1 it's 83 rupees so I think the
[21:18] Rupees is getting weaker and I was
[21:20] thinking why is this happening and
[21:22] frankly if you ask me I still don't
[21:24] understand why it's happening uh like I
[21:26] have no idea like if because I was
[21:28] seeing America since 2020 uh the M2
[21:32] money supply chart the money printing
[21:35] like almost 60% of US dollars were
[21:37] printed and in the last four years and I
[21:41] was like okay that should cause in
[21:43] that's is causing inflation in America
[21:45] so you know the currency is devaluing so
[21:48] INR should be more stronger but again
[21:51] INR is becoming weak in some of the
[21:53] other way and I was also looking at the
[21:56] M2 money supply chart in uh like India
[21:59] and I think the trend is similar like
[22:01] even in India uh the print money
[22:04] printing is has gone high but again uh
[22:07] it's
[22:08] something I still frankly don't
[22:11] understand the foreign exchange how that
[22:13] works and I think that was my reason and
[22:16] when I saw in India uh the real estate
[22:20] like if you see the houses in India it's
[22:24] crazy expensive like in Mumbai like uh
[22:28] it's similar to the prices in America
[22:31] like like a house in America like in a
[22:33] suburb area would be similar to cost in
[22:35] India whereas if you see the income
[22:38] ratio of course India income is not that
[22:41] high as America and I was like and lot
[22:44] of the people I was talking to uh the
[22:47] the people who had money you know who
[22:49] were investors um who who are rich and
[22:53] you know in that family like they were
[22:56] lot of people are buying homes in India
[22:58] as investment and store their wealth
[23:00] India is big on gold however like the
[23:03] young population like us and even
[23:06] younger than me uh it's it's a worrisome
[23:09] situation like can we even oh like like
[23:13] people can own one home year and even if
[23:16] you want to own one home it will still
[23:19] be that you have to go into uh a debt
[23:23] for 20 years 15 years and then you have
[23:26] to pay the interest rate uh so high and
[23:30] the interest rate can be increased any
[23:32] time like it's not under your control
[23:35] like uh so I was worried like I was like
[23:37] wow like uh I don't even know if I buy a
[23:42] house let's say in a interest rate of 8%
[23:46] that after 10 years it will still be 8%
[23:49] I don't even know that whereas if you
[23:51] see in Bitcoin like the monetary system
[23:54] is set for the next 100 years like we we
[23:57] see black Ro Fidelity everybody joined
[24:00] day before yesterday but Satoshi in 2009
[24:03] said the monetary system for the next
[24:05] 100 years I don't care the halling going
[24:08] to happen every four years so even
[24:10] though there is more Supply sorry demand
[24:13] the supply is still going to cut into
[24:15] half and that's amazing like right like
[24:19] in the first time in the history I see
[24:22] if a company is doing well in their
[24:24] stocks they issue more stocks they split
[24:26] their stocks if if a builder is doing
[24:28] good in his real estate he will build
[24:30] more buildings if a dweller is doing
[24:33] good in this he'll try to get more gold
[24:35] and sell like everybody matches the
[24:38] demand but here the demand is coming we
[24:42] all see it Larry fron TV today is
[24:45] telling every corporation how strong
[24:47] Bitcoin is it's it's it's an asset which
[24:50] can you know protect you but and
[24:53] corporations are listening all over the
[24:55] world they are slow lot of the corpor
[24:57] operations takes forever to make the
[24:59] decision so you can't have like a god
[25:01] candle in one day I think that's
[25:04] that's if you if you if you are uh if
[25:07] you are into Bitcoin for that I think
[25:09] you will always lose and you will get
[25:12] out early I think Bitcoin is about
[25:15] understanding it adoption wise what's
[25:17] the issue
[25:19] what again uh so Larry f I think in
[25:23] 2018 uh he came out and said Bitcoin is
[25:27] nothing but an index of money laundering
[25:30] he said that and there's a news article
[25:32] on that like it's a money laundering
[25:35] what changed what changed in 2020 2021
[25:39] when he changed his Stone to bitcoin
[25:42] what changed because I don't think so
[25:45] anything changed in Bitcoin it was uh so
[25:49] the question arised in my mind like what
[25:50] changed here why is he talking why why
[25:54] is he talking positive about Bitcoin
[25:56] this I don't understand he is the most
[25:57] most powerful man in the bank he's A9
[26:00] trillion AUM guy like why is he talking
[26:02] positive about Bitcoin at such an early
[26:05] stage uh and then I realized and I saw
[26:09] what's happening in the bond market in
[26:11] America bond market is going minus 30%
[26:14] year to date and I saw S&P 500 and I saw
[26:19] they are so overvalued and I saw real
[26:22] estate it's going over crazy I think 60%
[26:25] or 5050 uh I might be wrong in the stats
[26:27] but 50 to 60% of houses in America are
[26:31] investor homes meaning it's not even the
[26:34] primary resident so it's already
[26:37] overvalued and I was thinking like
[26:40] what's happening and then I thought
[26:41] about it like when you are a wealthy
[26:44] person when you have millions and
[26:46] billions your only concern is not to
[26:49] make money your main concern is to how
[26:52] to save your money like from devalue and
[26:55] that's exactly they saw if if you go to
[26:58] the bond market which is the most safest
[27:00] place on the earth safest asset on the
[27:03] earth it's depleting minus 30% there's
[27:06] again there's so much I don't I'm not an
[27:08] expert on bonds but I have heard so many
[27:11] podcast I've even listened to sephin and
[27:13] FAL Greg podcast it's called b b Clips
[27:17] or something and uh and then I saw real
[27:21] estate my friends and like friends in
[27:24] America uh it's so overvalued like it's
[27:27] hard for them to own that house and then
[27:29] when I saw S&P 500 I saw Apple it's 3
[27:33] trillion that's 80% of India that's one
[27:36] company and I'm like how do I if I want
[27:40] to get if I want to make money for my
[27:44] kids my grandkids how do I do it like
[27:47] where do I store my wealth and how do I
[27:50] invest and I think that's what changed
[27:53] for black Ro it's not him trying to you
[27:57] know advertise Bitcoin it's their
[27:59] clients who's asking for it it's their
[28:02] clients who's pushing them give us
[28:04] access because whatever the clients
[28:06] demand they have to meet it if you're a
[28:08] billionaire millionaire clients of Black
[28:10] Rock you have to meet their demand and
[28:13] say them like hey we want access to
[28:15] bitcoin you give it to us because we
[28:17] can't take our money and go to coinbase
[28:19] and buy self custody because again it's
[28:21] not that easy that they can take their
[28:23] money and go to the coinbase because we
[28:24] are talking a huge amount here for
[28:26] Corporation for high net worth client
[28:28] and there's some tax implication where
[28:30] they' have already made thousands of
[28:32] percent of profit so I don't know it's
[28:34] that easy to sell and then you know go
[28:37] buy right so the easiest way is for
[28:39] Black Rock to give them access so that
[28:41] they can move their fund to save to
[28:43] store in Bitcoin uh again it has its own
[28:47] limitations uh not your keys uh not your
[28:50] coin but again I just think like that
[28:53] was the issue in America where you're
[28:56] seeing and that's what why Larry is so
[28:58] interested in Bitcoin like in because
[29:01] now I always say everyone Bitcoin do not
[29:04] need Wall Street Wall Street need
[29:07] Bitcoin and that's the fact they need it
[29:11] more than ever and now in before they
[29:14] were saying it's a scam it's a money
[29:16] laundering whatever now they are like no
[29:19] we want to and there are few exception
[29:22] like Kathy word uh there are some folks
[29:25] in Fidelity who we year in Bitcoin since
[29:28] 2013 2014 but you know uh just a gesture
[29:33] that what changed in I'm super excited
[29:36] to announce that this podcast just got
[29:39] the first ever sponsor I just started
[29:42] the podcast out like three months ago
[29:45] and now we have 21 Bitcoin as a partner
[29:49] for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[29:53] only from day one and they teach and
[29:56] preach self custody this is my goto
[30:00] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[30:02] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[30:05] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[30:09] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[30:12] support this podcast use code Robin and
[30:15] click the link in the description it's
[30:18] it's interesting because I think a lot
[30:19] of people oh now Bitcoin is legitimized
[30:22] because now the Bitcoin ETF is approved
[30:25] everything is now going on the way but I
[30:27] think it's the other way around like
[30:29] it's not that uh
[30:32] Bitcoin it's not like Bitcoin is now
[30:34] coming in
[30:35] this great system it's the other way
[30:38] around the uh big system the big boys
[30:41] money they realize they have to join it
[30:43] it's like a the it's like as you said
[30:45] it's a Grassroots movement the clients
[30:47] wanted it everybody was asking about it
[30:50] and they had no choice if you saw the
[30:52] interview with Gary Gensler I think
[30:55] yesterday or two days ago uh where he
[30:58] said oh Bitcoin is so bad and illicit
[31:00] activities and stuff like that you
[31:02] clearly could see like there are a lot
[31:04] of theories either he's lying either he
[31:06] actually got didn't didn't got it but he
[31:08] has an MIT class so I think he
[31:10] understands Bitcoin on some level but
[31:13] they are forced to do it no matter what
[31:16] they're doing they have to come in and
[31:18] that's the the crazy thing about Bitcoin
[31:20] it just goes with like a uh just like
[31:24] with a massive force over the fincial
[31:27] system and depletes the uh Financial
[31:31] energy out of real estate out of
[31:33] everything every asset that is not as
[31:36] good as a store of value and that's
[31:38] really interesting to see in real life
[31:39] and it's an amazing time to be alive
[31:41] actually and it shows just the the power
[31:44] that also the US and is is now coming
[31:48] into that that whole whole scene yeah
[31:50] that's uh and even with Gary genier I
[31:53] think it's he and that's what I was
[31:56] trying to say even I think on Twitter we
[31:58] had that extremes that if you if you
[32:00] listen to his MIT lectures he understand
[32:03] Bitcoin like he he he understand how how
[32:06] disruptive the technology is how
[32:08] disruptive Bitcoin is but again I think
[32:10] it's again we can't comment on what they
[32:13] are thinking but one thing which I found
[32:15] really weird was if you approved a
[32:19] Bitcoin squat ETF how can you come on a
[32:22] TV and say we don't support the
[32:24] underlying asset like that makes no
[32:26] sense like it's like
[32:28] you are allowing somebody to come up
[32:31] with the ETF but then the underlying
[32:33] asset could be anything like you know it
[32:36] could be if you think about it it makes
[32:38] zero sense so there was one really cool
[32:41] theory in my comments that said uh oh
[32:45] he's just closing the door for ethereum
[32:47] ETFs like he's saying now that Bitcoin
[32:50] is already like not good and it's only
[32:53] for elicit activities and the all the
[32:55] altcoins are even verse so so that
[32:59] somewhat was like it's just a 4D chz
[33:01] move he just wants to close the door for
[33:03] any other ETF other than Bitcoin I I
[33:07] have no clue if this can even be true
[33:09] but it was an interesting uh don't think
[33:13] so that Gary is interested in doing all
[33:16] that like he's closing window but it's
[33:18] just that after all he's a he's from
[33:21] government secc is a government body uh
[33:24] he he can't just go and straight say
[33:26] okay you know go buy Bitcoin stuff like
[33:28] that like again again as soon one thing
[33:31] which was clear as soon as Black Rock
[33:33] filed for the spot ETF in July or June I
[33:37] was sure that it's approving like yeah
[33:41] there's no way Black Rock fidelities
[33:44] they G to join in with without that
[33:46] Assurance because imagine Larry Finn
[33:49] going on a TV and saying Bitcoin is an
[33:51] international asset Bitcoin is bigger
[33:54] than a gold it's bigger than a
[33:56] government he said all the stuff today
[33:59] why he won't because do you think
[34:02] 0.30% AUM fees will make him Rich no he
[34:07] understands it like and and it's good
[34:09] that he's speaking good about it I don't
[34:11] know what's his purpose uh but uh I'm
[34:14] one thing I'm sure every corporations
[34:17] out there is listening it's listening to
[34:19] him even though they will buy or not but
[34:21] they're listening now it it will be very
[34:23] hard to for asset manager to tell you
[34:27] it's a risky asset it's a it's a scam
[34:29] asset it's fraud they won't say that
[34:32] that that narrative is gone now you know
[34:35] so it it's moved forward now uh some
[34:38] people will still ignore it some people
[34:40] will still fight it some people because
[34:42] again it's everything against what we
[34:45] have been taught since our childhood
[34:47] like anything which can have a huge
[34:49] potential and money uh in India
[34:52] especially it's like stay away from it
[34:54] like it's a it's a pyramid scheme you
[34:56] know
[34:57] how can you make so much money like
[34:59] there's no way it can go so high like
[35:01] you know but nobody will nobody will
[35:03] learn that what's the world asset and
[35:06] how small it is it's like buying Google
[35:08] Amazon back in 1995 it's like it's so
[35:11] early nobody understands that because
[35:14] Google did thousand X since 1995 to now
[35:17] like why not Bitcoin Bitcoin is not just
[35:20] a company it's a bigger asset class like
[35:22] it's it's so again it requires proof of
[35:26] work you have to study you have to put
[35:28] in your thousands hours because if you
[35:30] don't put in your thousand hours either
[35:32] you will Panic either you will listen to
[35:35] other Society like our media uh what
[35:39] countries are doing oh China banned it
[35:40] America Bann it India banned it oh uh J
[35:44] Jamie Diamond is saying this Larry f is
[35:46] saying this Etc no just study the asset
[35:51] like listen see the developers who are
[35:53] working day and night and see the people
[35:56] who are contributing see the miners who
[35:58] are mining all over the world uh and
[36:03] again so yeah I I just feel like like
[36:08] don't don't Focus too much on the media
[36:12] I I hate tweeting uh like replying on
[36:14] comments on Twitter but I have to do it
[36:17] because I feel like somebody has to
[36:20] speak like that's why I try to correct
[36:23] some people like in RBI governor in
[36:26] India he said uh bit he compared bit uh
[36:29] not Bitcoin but the entire
[36:31] cryptocurrency industry to uh tulip
[36:33] Mania right so I I again I don't I'm not
[36:37] like why did you say it or on it's his
[36:39] choice fine respect it because uh it's
[36:42] everybody's has a freedom of speech but
[36:45] I just went and corrected like I just
[36:46] replied to that post like hey you know
[36:49] what tulip Mania didn't last it for more
[36:51] than three years Bitcoin is there for 15
[36:53] years and uh there's a famous quote from
[36:57] Naval and he said U tulips are not
[37:01] durable scalable divisible easy to
[37:04] transfer not
[37:06] fungible so are no
[37:10] money
[37:12] so it's an interesting world we live in
[37:15] it's very early and um I want to start
[37:18] my podcast in Hindi because if you see
[37:22] in
[37:23] India there's hardly anybody talking in
[37:26] Hindi and explaining people like it was
[37:30] I was trying to send like a video to my
[37:32] mom to watch so that she understand what
[37:36] is bitcoin like just the basics and it
[37:39] was so hard for me to find anything in
[37:42] Hindi and India is a population of 1.3
[37:46] billion right so I'm like I need to and
[37:51] and then I went to that DAC Bitcoin show
[37:52] right and I talked with so many
[37:54] bitcoiners who have so much knowledge
[37:56] I'm like I'm going to start with you
[37:58] guys you know what like let's start
[38:00] talking in Hindi let's talk uh record it
[38:03] put it out and even though I don't care
[38:07] if it gets the YouTube or views anything
[38:10] for me it's much more like if my friends
[38:12] and family ask for it I can send that
[38:15] hey watch you know because not everybody
[38:18] likes to read the book and unfortunately
[38:21] the Bitcoin standard is also not
[38:23] available in hry so uh I know we are
[38:26] trying hard to get that book in Hindi
[38:29] but there's no Hindi material like for
[38:31] Bitcoin and imagine saw you had I think
[38:35] even a conversation on Twitter with
[38:37] cerine about it yeah yeah yeah I I I did
[38:41] talk with CER uh he replied to my
[38:43] comments so we didn't talk personally
[38:44] but he replied to my comment saying that
[38:46] hey you know what you need to find the
[38:48] publisher in India who can you know uh
[38:51] buy the rights from bil and then there
[38:53] are some people who can help and again
[38:56] it's something I'm I'm thinking with my
[38:58] other bitcoiner friends as well like
[39:01] what can we do to make that book in
[39:03] Hindi but again that's a long process
[39:05] because we have to find writer and all
[39:07] but it's immediate need so how do I
[39:09] start let's start talking in Hindi put
[39:12] the podcast out spread the word
[39:17] because if we don't do that lot of the
[39:20] people are won't understand the true
[39:24] value of Bitcoin and they might get lost
[39:26] and lot of the other stuff right uh even
[39:31] if they come into this sector like they
[39:33] will be like okay eum okay let's do
[39:35] Solana let's do this that and again I
[39:40] I'm not saying what is good and what is
[39:41] bad all I'm saying is my focus is
[39:44] Bitcoin and I just focus on bitcoin and
[39:47] it's very essential to be in this world
[39:50] because again we don't know what's going
[39:53] to happen for I I just feel like what
[39:55] makes Bitcoin different than everything
[39:57] else is Bitcoin is the only Network
[40:00] which is truly decentralized there's no
[40:03] person controlling it there's no CEO
[40:06] who's coming up with a road map uh
[40:09] there's nobody changing the protocol
[40:11] from it it's a community who has to do
[40:13] it and that's that's my whole point like
[40:17] even Satoshi I was thinking about it
[40:19] what if Satoshi comes back today uh even
[40:22] if he comes back today all he can do is
[40:24] sell his Bitcoin which we don't even
[40:27] know he might be doing it like he might
[40:29] be still mining because people track the
[40:32] Satoshi era wallets but what if he never
[40:34] stopped mining what if he's still mining
[40:37] in 2014 2015 2016 he might be using that
[40:40] Bitcoin to survive to you know have a
[40:42] good life we don't know he might be
[40:44] still there what if he comes back but
[40:47] even if he comes back there's no way he
[40:50] can I talked with the developers friend
[40:52] because I'm not a developer I've I've
[40:54] never written a code so I talked with
[40:56] them and they made me understand like
[40:58] there's no way even he can change
[41:01] anything like the supply or anything he
[41:03] would have zero influence yeah he can be
[41:05] a spok person like he can guide like
[41:08] where should be appro but that's all but
[41:10] again it's the community it's too big
[41:12] now uh it has
[41:15] spread in the entire world now so you
[41:18] know like there's no way one person it's
[41:21] Al also interesting because um even if
[41:25] he comes back
[41:27] how would we believe him like I assume
[41:30] honestly I assume he uh put the keys for
[41:34] the first one million Bitcoin away he
[41:36] was so thoughtful about everything and I
[41:40] think the first million Bitcoin that he
[41:42] owns I think the keys he just uh throw
[41:46] away I think uh because it was important
[41:49] for him that those Bitcoin never moves
[41:51] and this is like cut away from Supply
[41:54] maybe he was like let's make a supply 20
[41:57] million and I get the first million and
[41:58] that I throw away and I think even if he
[42:01] comes back I don't think that first
[42:03] million of Bitcoin will ever move and uh
[42:07] that he even if he comes back like how
[42:09] can he prove it with no moving it and
[42:13] honestly um I don't think he comes back
[42:16] 15 years like H how how can you live
[42:20] with the expectation to come back 15
[42:22] years in the sun with with that asset
[42:25] that just
[42:26] uh climbs up and conquers the world with
[42:29] knowing you did it you just started it
[42:33] like one year you left really early and
[42:36] now you like either he's dead either he
[42:39] is like some kind of uh none in some
[42:44] some some church somewhere really hidden
[42:48] I don't know what's your theory about
[42:50] it no I was talking to my friends other
[42:53] day and I was thinking like uh and I was
[42:55] telling them Satoshi might be uh he has
[42:58] to be a person um who is Big on Humanity
[43:04] like there's no way a person who has
[43:07] developed such a big idea don't want any
[43:09] credit okay fine no credit he wants to
[43:12] stay private fine but not using his
[43:16] wealth and he and in two years I think
[43:20] in after two years or three years he he
[43:23] just said hey I'm moving on to the other
[43:25] things I think Bitcoin is in good hands
[43:28] and he just left and he understood that
[43:31] that's the most important part for
[43:32] Bitcoin because if there is a
[43:34] spokesperson and you know he came back
[43:37] again once as well like there was some
[43:39] issues uh where somebody was claiming to
[43:41] be Satoshi he just came back and said I
[43:44] am not that I'm not Theos like like you
[43:47] know and then he disappeared right
[43:48] because that's it and he just left and I
[43:51] just feel like that person has to be so
[43:53] strong that that you know the pain in
[43:56] his body like he he he he had a big pain
[43:59] like I don't know uh he he published the
[44:03] paper right after the recession of 2008
[44:05] uh and you know there there are some
[44:08] people who might have that experience
[44:10] like you know who have seen their family
[44:12] being poor or you know have seen their
[44:14] family being you know always like
[44:16] working hard but never getting you know
[44:19] it has to be that like something which
[44:20] is like you know personal to you and
[44:23] they it's like and he was following the
[44:25] words since past 20 years because you
[44:27] see the reference goes to past 20 years
[44:30] he connected the dot he even reached out
[44:33] to some of the people even before
[44:35] publishing the white paper like I heard
[44:37] like he reached out to Adam B in 2008
[44:40] Summers to talk about it and so it has
[44:44] to be even if he comes back today and
[44:47] you imagine like Bitcoin for Satoshi
[44:50] would be the kid like his kid like no
[44:52] ways he'll come back and destroy it and
[44:54] you know even try to you know influence
[44:56] in any way and and as I said I always
[44:59] think what if he was he he went away in
[45:02] 2011 but what if he was still mining
[45:05] from other nodes and you know other like
[45:08] every other way like he might be still
[45:09] mining in 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 he
[45:14] might still have Bitcoin and he's
[45:16] surviving like he doesn't even need his
[45:18] we don't even know that he has 1 million
[45:20] it's like a like a number which floats
[45:23] everywhere nobody can verify all we can
[45:25] see is Satoshi era wallets have they
[45:28] moved that's it like that's the only way
[45:30] like the blocks which were initially
[45:32] mined just by Satoshi and Hal we don't
[45:35] know I I pray that you know he's alive
[45:37] he's seen this and he he he was mining
[45:42] maybe he's a minor even today and he's
[45:46] he's watching all of us that you know uh
[45:49] he he just did so good for all of us
[45:51] like it gives gave us a hope because
[45:54] when you and I tell my friends as well
[45:56] when you truly study Bitcoin it puts you
[45:59] out of depression it puts you out of uh
[46:02] worry that how my future will be you
[46:04] know like how will I make money how will
[46:07] I do this and that where should I
[46:10] speculate should I put into the stock
[46:12] market should I put into the real estate
[46:14] what should I do like it just solves
[46:16] everything then you truly understand all
[46:18] you have to do is relax you know relax
[46:21] and of course as I always tell
[46:24] everyone the main purpose of Bitcoin if
[46:28] you read the white paper the first
[46:29] sentence it
[46:31] said a peer-to-peer transaction with no
[46:34] trusted third party financial
[46:36] institution something so I tell everyone
[46:39] self custody it like that's the most
[46:41] important part of Bitcoin because if you
[46:44] have it self custody again it's your
[46:47] power no like you can move anywhere in
[46:49] the world you can be you know do good
[46:52] for the society it's
[46:54] yours and then also learn how to self-
[46:57] custody because just the self we saw the
[47:00] fees going very high right so you got to
[47:04] learn how to do the utxo management
[47:06] meaning don't put small transactions in
[47:09] self- custody like don't buy $10 and
[47:12] then put it in self custody because that
[47:14] $10 might be useless because the fees
[47:17] can go so high that you won't be able to
[47:19] spend that $10 so make sure that it's at
[47:23] least right now which I've seen on
[47:25] Twitter with the experts they say 1
[47:27] million Satoshi 1 million Satoshi is
[47:29] around like how much $400
[47:32] $450 like whatever rate is Bitcoin
[47:35] 442,000 so it's $420 so when you get
[47:38] $420 worth at least then do one
[47:42] transaction into sales custody just one
[47:44] don't put 1010 because that can go into
[47:48] dust make sure you do one transaction of
[47:52] let's say you you put your money on
[47:54] coinbase and you do doing $10 a day okay
[47:57] or $10 a month whatever until it becomes
[48:00] that $450 $500 keep it there and then
[48:03] move to yourself custody month
[48:05] transaction I think it's really
[48:07] important to spread that message yeah
[48:09] it's what are your thoughts actually on
[48:12] more advanced uh Bitcoin stuff as you
[48:14] mentioned utxo management coin join uh
[48:18] no kyc exchanges peer top multi like
[48:21] what's your what's your like how far and
[48:25] how far should newbi maybe go in there I
[48:28] think especially in the beginning it can
[48:30] be overwhelming you T So management coin
[48:32] train kyc like most I things just start
[48:36] with a full kyc Bitcoin exchange where
[48:39] they get the Bitcoin and keep it on
[48:40] Exchange then they slowly like learn
[48:42] more and more stuff like what's your
[48:44] thoughts about that see uh for me I
[48:47] think uh I never thought about like uh
[48:51] kyc non kyc because uh for me my journey
[48:54] always was like buying from an exchange
[48:56] I always was a like you know that's how
[48:59] I thought I never thought about oh you
[49:01] know what we should have non kyc what if
[49:03] you know that happens and all but again
[49:05] it has its own perks but for me I think
[49:08] and if you see the folks in India like
[49:11] 90% of people won't even understand like
[49:13] if you talk about coin like coin join
[49:17] kyc non kyc it's more like buy it and
[49:20] all I suggest to people is whatever
[49:23] wherever you're buying it from just buy
[49:25] it make sure when it becomes am move it
[49:27] to your self custody and do it in a way
[49:31] learn uh what I am big on is as a
[49:34] bitcoiner when you become when you
[49:36] mature in the journey like I started I
[49:39] kept it on Exchange I didn't self
[49:41] custody for a while and then I was like
[49:44] I need because I was worried I was like
[49:47] no I'm I'm happy with coinbase like you
[49:49] know coinbase is not going anywhere it's
[49:51] a publicly listed no it wasn't publicly
[49:53] listed back then but even though I had
[49:55] Trust on coinbase like it's not going
[49:57] anywhere it's us they the CEO won't do
[49:59] anything like that was my mindset then I
[50:03] switched on to Ledger uh because that
[50:05] was the only name you heard from always
[50:09] like in 2019 like everybody's like lger
[50:12] Ledger lger
[50:13] 2020s then I went into uh c car and
[50:18] Sparrow like how to connect cold card
[50:20] with Sparrow and then you learn then I
[50:22] learned about multiset how to do multi
[50:26] and then how to do collaborative
[50:27] multisig like there are functions like
[50:30] unchain Kasa like there's so much going
[50:33] on like you know so that's the journey I
[50:35] feel but I've never thought about uh
[50:39] other stuff like coin join or kyc non
[50:42] kyc what if government does something I
[50:45] feel having it self- custody itself is a
[50:49] powerful thing because let's say if your
[50:51] government changes their point of view
[50:53] on bitcoin uh then you go to a country
[50:57] where it's supportive where you know
[51:00] they support Bitcoin like that's how the
[51:02] world will be some countries will be
[51:04] against it some countries will be for it
[51:06] and you can just like I mean you have
[51:10] the power to move because if you have
[51:12] real estate you have gold you have all
[51:14] that you can't even you don't even have
[51:16] that power you have to either sell
[51:17] everything and then go like you can't
[51:20] take it with you uh so I think that's
[51:23] the power like today India is is
[51:25] allowing uh the transactions they are
[51:27] allowing to buy Bitcoin there's no
[51:30] regulations like not like they're not
[51:31] Banning anything so but what if they
[51:34] change after 10 years right so I I mean
[51:37] I don't know I can't predict you can't
[51:39] predict what's going to happen so but if
[51:42] you have self- custody uh either you can
[51:44] be okay fine you banned it it's fine
[51:47] I'll just move from to the other country
[51:49] where it's supportive so it's you know
[51:52] and then there will be a competition in
[51:54] the world like like Black Rock we see in
[51:56] Black Rock today the Black Rock
[51:58] infidelity is like spot ETF Vanguard is
[52:01] like it's against our values fine cool
[52:05] we will go to Black Rock infidelity if
[52:07] you want to buy right like stuff like
[52:09] that like yeah
[52:11] that's yeah the game theory is amazing
[52:14] and also that it's that is an actually
[52:17] really underestimated point of of
[52:19] Bitcoin and I think not even a lot of
[52:21] people not as many people as should be
[52:25] talk about that you can use uh a head
[52:28] wallet go over the any border and take
[52:32] millions and billions with you like try
[52:35] this with gold try this with real estate
[52:37] try this with anything else you can just
[52:40] remember 12 to 24 words in your head and
[52:42] you can walk over an a border with
[52:46] millions in your head I mean I don't
[52:48] recommend having your Bitcoin only in
[52:51] your head but uh you you could do that
[52:55] um yeah it's a tool because because
[52:58] imagine again let's not even think about
[53:01] like oh government might do bad or
[53:03] anything okay let's I I I try to be
[53:07] person who thinks about the positive
[53:09] side always like I don't worry about
[53:11] stuff hundred things can go wrong I
[53:13] can't predict everything right but
[53:15] imagine like what we saw in Russia and
[53:18] Ukraine right uh there was a war and
[53:21] then when it happened in Ukraine people
[53:23] who were in Ukraine had to go and as a
[53:27] ref become Refugee in European country
[53:30] or America did can did can they to take
[53:33] their assets with them no right it's
[53:36] gone their life savings is gone but if
[53:40] they had Bitcoin access at least they
[53:43] could start their new life anywhere in
[53:45] the world all they had to even if they
[53:48] move to Euro America anywhere let's say
[53:51] they even forgot the hardware wallet
[53:52] like even that if they had that in their
[53:54] mind or written it somewhere like they
[53:56] could go in the other world and start
[53:59] their life again like the people who
[54:01] have worked hard in their life like
[54:04] imagine the house is gone you know like
[54:08] I I just feel like what if I was there
[54:10] and my home and everything is destroyed
[54:12] and I'm going to a new country to start
[54:14] a new life it's really hard because I
[54:17] did it I went to us as a student and I
[54:20] did it but at least I was not like I had
[54:23] support I had money from my family and
[54:26] whatever right like but IM I can't
[54:29] imagine going to a country where you
[54:32] have nothing you have to start uh from
[54:35] scratch so Bitcoin solves that and it's
[54:39] it's a powerful tool where you can self
[54:41] custody even if you have kyc it's fine
[54:44] you can self custody um you can pay
[54:47] taxes on it whatever but I don't think
[54:50] so if you live in a country where uh
[54:53] there's democracy I don't think so
[54:55] they'll be like you know you
[54:58] can't take your Bitcoin with you
[55:01] anywhere yeah it's a it's an amazing
[55:03] Point your video is gone I don't know
[55:05] why no no I see you still I it's I I
[55:08] think it's
[55:09] fine
[55:11] um before we close up the the
[55:14] conversation with the end end routine of
[55:16] the podcast I have one more question and
[55:19] it came into my mind I think vivec was
[55:21] the one that reposted this and it was
[55:24] like
[55:25] so many CEOs of big companies like
[55:29] Microsoft Uber Google uh even in in in
[55:34] uh the UK the mayor of the Prime
[55:36] Minister of of the UK they're all
[55:39] Indians like why are so many H great
[55:42] CEOs Indians what what are the what are
[55:45] the Indians doing so so good yeah I
[55:48] think India
[55:51] uh they are first of all we all know
[55:54] right like again if there are a lot of
[55:56] CEOs pm and whatever like in India like
[55:59] they are talented they they they have
[56:01] the mind they are willing to work hard
[56:03] because you don't again it's not just
[56:05] mind or Talent it's hard work it's the
[56:08] consistency it's the persistent they
[56:10] they are willing to put in that work you
[56:12] see lot of the American CEO who are
[56:15] Indians they left their country to be in
[56:18] India to begin with they came in there
[56:20] as a students they did their life they
[56:23] worked hard they worked in that company
[56:25] Su Pai Satya n like they worked for so
[56:29] long in Google Microsoft then they
[56:31] became CEO right and I I just think that
[56:35] if that that's the whole thing like and
[56:37] of course India like there are so much
[56:39] potential here it's just that people in
[56:41] India are looking for the right
[56:43] opportunity and I think this is the
[56:45] decade for India where you know lot of
[56:48] the countries in the world is seeing
[56:51] India they are moving to India they they
[56:53] are moving their offices to India
[56:55] because again there's too much labor a
[56:59] lot of Labor they speak English they're
[57:02] smart talented and I feel that's the
[57:04] whole thing like where you see lot of
[57:06] the smart Indians even like PM of UK
[57:09] Rishi I don't know him like I mean I
[57:13] have not followed him like he so I don't
[57:15] I can't comment but I also see VI he is
[57:18] running for president in US uh he's a
[57:21] he's a bitcoiner I mean he's not a bit
[57:23] like I mean he's Pro Bitcoin he holds
[57:26] Bitcoin I watched one of his podcast he
[57:29] speaks really well uh it's just that
[57:32] it's I I don't know why there is Indians
[57:36] everywhere but you will see a lot more
[57:38] in the coming decade because India I
[57:41] think is just getting started and I
[57:43] that's why I think Bitcoin is so much
[57:45] needed in India like we want to because
[57:47] in when internet was coming if you see
[57:50] all the major internet companies is in
[57:52] America Google Amazon Facebook but lot
[57:55] of the backend offices and you know a
[57:58] lot of the again there are a lot of good
[58:01] companies who are Consulting companies
[58:03] in India and we we lost that race for
[58:06] some of the other reason like where us
[58:08] got the first uh Advantage because they
[58:11] adopted internet too fast and we were
[58:14] slow right because of various reason
[58:17] infrastructures and a lot of stuff but I
[58:19] think this time I think if we adopt it
[58:22] faster because America is already
[58:24] adopting it
[58:25] even though they can say all kind of bad
[58:27] stuff like you will see some politicians
[58:29] say but in the background everything is
[58:32] happening exchanges are publicly listed
[58:34] mining companies are publicly listed
[58:36] they have a spot ETF so pay attention
[58:40] the world needs to pay attention that
[58:42] America is again taking a you know lead
[58:46] and if we don't catch up again it's
[58:49] going to be you know it will be hard so
[58:52] I feel very positive that if we as a
[58:54] Bitcoin ERS who can spread the word who
[58:57] can make people understand uh why it's
[59:00] important I think uh we have a fair
[59:03] chance to be in a better world yeah
[59:05] that's that's a great point like I I was
[59:08] also thinking yeah maybe because Indian
[59:09] are so many people but there also a lot
[59:12] of Chinese people and there are not a
[59:14] lot of Chinese CEOs on on on the the
[59:17] like there there's lot fact a lot of
[59:19] factors since I got an Indian girlfriend
[59:22] question this this question to myself
[59:25] I'm really impressed with with Indians
[59:27] these days I I like it um moving on to
[59:30] the end routine actually the the actual
[59:33] question from the previous guest was
[59:35] about satoshi's wallet but we kind of
[59:38] covered that already so I have another
[59:42] question that just comes from me usually
[59:44] the endro is the previous guest asked
[59:46] the next guest the question without
[59:47] knowing who's the next guest is but we
[59:49] covered in the podcast his question so
[59:52] your question is now what would you do
[59:55] if there was no Bitcoin right now what
[59:58] would you invest like what would be the
[60:00] option for
[60:02] you that's so
[60:05] hard because frankly I get scared just
[60:10] thinking what if there was no Bitcoin
[60:12] like what if I would have not found it
[60:14] uh because I see so much hope in Bitcoin
[60:18] there's so much potential and it's such
[60:21] an early stage and uh again uh without
[60:26] Bitcoin I think I would just follow like
[60:30] what 99% of people in India does like uh
[60:34] or in America bought a real estate uh
[60:38] like house or gold and and then trade
[60:42] stocks I think those were the three I
[60:44] mean I always had to speculate like
[60:47] what's going to be the best thing and
[60:49] you know where do I put my money how do
[60:51] I move how do I but yeah so without
[60:56] Bitcoin I think that's the world and I
[60:58] think with Bitcoin I'm just at peace uh
[61:02] I just feel like it's not me alone there
[61:05] are so many people in the world who are
[61:08] bitcoiners who are working day and night
[61:11] for Bitcoin and who's protecting the
[61:13] network there are miners who are
[61:16] protecting there are node Runners who
[61:18] are protecting there are buyers and
[61:19] sellers who are supporting like it's not
[61:23] me so and and it's truly decentralized
[61:27] no person has the authority I saw it
[61:29] firsthand heard from so many
[61:32] people so that gives me that comfort
[61:36] that you know uh I'm at a good spot it's
[61:40] a it's a scary place where you go when
[61:42] there is no Bitcoin I I fully agree um
[61:46] where can people find you where can
[61:48] people get in contact with you yeah I
[61:50] mean I am on X uh uh I recently uh
[61:54] started posting a lot like it's been
[61:56] very recent because I had that urge like
[61:59] I need to spread this word in India have
[62:01] people talk about it more and so yeah uh
[62:05] it's St Bitcoin 21 uh on Twitter that's
[62:09] my handle and then I'm also as I said
[62:11] I'm coming up with my podcast uh study
[62:14] pitco with Aditya and I'm going to link
[62:16] it to my ex when it's ready but it's
[62:19] more like I want to invite the guest who
[62:21] can speak the local language uh and
[62:24] I want to talk about what's going on in
[62:26] India what are some of the trends how we
[62:28] are developing what are the developers
[62:30] doing uh what are the miners doing how
[62:33] India is coming up with their exchanges
[62:36] wallets so it will be much more focused
[62:39] but also what I want to do in that
[62:41] podcast is also just for my audience if
[62:44] I spread this podcast to my friends and
[62:46] family and or in India what I want to do
[62:49] with my podcast
[62:51] is teach people what is better like you
[62:55] know who was Satoshi like how did like
[62:58] how did it ever started like what
[63:01] happened in the last 10 years and I want
[63:04] to talk with those people like I don't
[63:05] want to talk about Prize or the current
[63:09] market scenario or which country will
[63:11] ban it like I don't care I I care less I
[63:15] want to talk
[63:17] about why you need Bitcoin what is
[63:20] bitcoin and I think 99% people in India
[63:25] has no idea I would say
[63:29] 99.99% people in India don't have don't
[63:32] know what is bitcoin even though they
[63:35] might have heard about Bitcoin but
[63:38] nobody has spend that 100 hours to study
[63:42] it and because of the language barrier
[63:45] as well because there's no material in
[63:48] Hindi I'm not kidding there's no
[63:50] material so that's my goal uh to make as
[63:54] many people in India uh uh bitcoiner who
[63:58] have studied more than thousand hours or
[64:00] 100 hours U I don't care how many
[64:03] Bitcoin they hold or how many STS they
[64:05] hold like how many hours have you put in
[64:08] because if you have studied Bitcoin I
[64:10] feel like even let's say you don't own
[64:12] any but you know Bitcoin in and out
[64:15] you'll be much more valuable in future
[64:19] company will hire you your career will
[64:21] be much more better uh then if you don't
[64:25] know about me yeah 100% I think this is
