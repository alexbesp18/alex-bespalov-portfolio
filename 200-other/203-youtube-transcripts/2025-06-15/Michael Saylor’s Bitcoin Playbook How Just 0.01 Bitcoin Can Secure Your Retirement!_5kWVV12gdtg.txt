[00:00] My mission is to make sure I get as many
[00:02] people to have a million Satoshi's. It's
[00:04] all about the Satoshi's. I know Bitcoin
[00:05] is the name, but Satoshi's are going to
[00:07] be the thing that everybody's going to
[00:08] gravitate to because everybody can't
[00:10] afford, you know, a Bitcoin. Obviously,
[00:12] tariff is a tax, right? I will say that
[00:14] it's a tax on imports coming in. But
[00:16] inflation is only come from one place in
[00:18] in America and that's Washington DC and
[00:20] that's the money printer. At least I
[00:21] know, man, when I go to work, I know
[00:23] that my money and my time is
[00:25] deflationary now, right? I can actually
[00:26] go to work and save and I don't have to
[00:28] worry about investing and stuff like
[00:29] that saying, "Oh, you need to read the
[00:31] Bitcoin standard. You need to listen to
[00:32] Michael Sailor. You need to do all that
[00:34] stuff." If you have a Lightning wallet
[00:36] on your phone and you zap them some
[00:38] SASs, whether it's 10 SATs, 20 sets or
[00:40] whatever, and then after a little bit
[00:42] they're, you know, they see the quote
[00:44] unquote price of the fiat currency
[00:45] underneath of the SAS going up and up
[00:47] and up and then you making little touch
[00:49] points here and there about it. Every
[00:50] once in a while, you'll bring it up. the
[00:52] freedom just to do what you want and to
[00:54] pursue the things that make you happy in
[00:56] life. I think Bitcoin is going to be
[00:58] able to do that.
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] What has happened uh since your laugh's
[01:06] been on? It's been about a year. Yeah,
[01:09] it's been I think it's been summer 2024,
[01:13] something like that. And I think the
[01:14] last time we talked we were talking
[01:15] about the uh the 2024 election, which I
[01:18] think was one of the most important
[01:20] elections ever. And I tell people that
[01:22] um you know politics are important for
[01:25] Bitcoin obviously with uh strategic
[01:27] Bitcoin reserve and the Bitcoin act and
[01:30] that executive order with the strategic
[01:31] Bitcoin reserve was big and if Trump
[01:34] didn't win and again this is good for
[01:36] the world if Trump didn't win. Imagine
[01:37] what would have happened. You know if
[01:39] Camala Harris would have won um we
[01:41] wouldn't be having the things we have
[01:42] now. So we have that and then um I'm
[01:46] just loving the fact that more people
[01:48] are being aware of of Bitcoin. and we
[01:50] hit 100,000 since we talked, which was
[01:52] which a big deal. And um I just can't
[01:56] believe the price is this low coming
[01:58] into uh all this great news, you know.
[02:02] But I've started a live stream that I do
[02:05] Monday through Friday. Uh I give away
[02:07] Satoshi's with like a spin of a wheel I
[02:10] do and I also do some trivia questions
[02:12] and stuff like that. And my lives go
[02:14] from two to three hours a day, Monday
[02:16] through Friday. And then I I'm still
[02:18] doing Satoshi Saturday. I'm up to
[02:19] episode 60s something and I'm just
[02:22] trying to learn every day and my mission
[02:24] is to make sure I get as many people uh
[02:26] to have a million Satoshi's as I can
[02:29] because I know that um it's all about
[02:31] the Satoshi's. I know Bitcoin is the
[02:33] name, but Satoshi's are going to be the
[02:35] thing that everybody's going to uh
[02:37] gravitate to because everybody can't
[02:38] afford, you know, Bitcoin obviously. And
[02:41] I think that's just very very important
[02:42] to get as many people as we can on here.
[02:44] Is it adoption? What what is the meaning
[02:47] of uh one million Satoshi? What what
[02:49] will that like? Why why one millionaire?
[02:52] Well, because in the in the United
[02:54] States and maybe other countries too be
[02:57] a millionaire that's like making it
[02:59] right. I want to be a millionaire. I be
[03:00] want to be a millionaire. But I think
[03:02] with the finite supply of Satoshi's in
[03:05] the world, I think personally it'll be
[03:07] more rare to be a Satoshi millionaire
[03:10] than it will be a fiat millionaire. So I
[03:13] just tell people if you don't want to
[03:14] study, you don't want to do anything,
[03:16] that's fine. Just get to a million
[03:17] satoshi's, put them in cold storage and
[03:19] wake up in 20 years and see what
[03:20] happens. Awesome. I think that's like
[03:23] the the
[03:24] the you also mentioned the price like
[03:27] why do you think it's because it's
[03:29] fascinates me when when we hit the 100K
[03:32] and we're going through so much positive
[03:36] news, it it boggles me that we are still
[03:38] so so low. I think because we we look at
[03:41] it from our perspective because we're in
[03:43] our Bitcoin bubble, we just, you know,
[03:46] don't understand it. But me, but me
[03:48] personally, I'm I'm loving it. I'm
[03:49] loving when the price goes down. As of
[03:51] this recording, we had that little, you
[03:53] know, dip down to 70 something thousand.
[03:54] It looked like we were decoupling a
[03:57] little bit from the stock market. Those
[03:58] few days when everything crashed, but
[04:01] over the weekend, you know, Bitcoin went
[04:03] down and it's it's it's cheaper stats
[04:04] for everybody. But what I think's going
[04:06] on, Robin, I think there's a little bit
[04:07] of manipulation. Um, I think there's a
[04:10] little bit of paper Bitcoin out there
[04:11] and I think the whales are selling off
[04:13] at certain points and times where they
[04:15] can just scare the market, buy more at a
[04:18] lower price and get back in. I I don't I
[04:20] don't have any uh proof of that. But
[04:22] again, with all this adoption going on,
[04:24] like how are people not buying this
[04:25] thing? But again, they're not in our
[04:27] world. And it just shows you how early
[04:29] we are. Every time I look at the price
[04:32] and I see how low it is, cuz this thing
[04:34] should be in the millions in US dollars.
[04:36] It should be if everybody if we put a
[04:38] microchip in people's brains of
[04:40] everything that me and you know
[04:42] Robin at nighttime when they were
[04:45] sleeping what would the price be when
[04:46] they woke up in the morning you know
[04:49] everybody would just go rushing in right
[04:51] so I just think it it's cause of like I
[04:53] said maybe a little bit of manipulation
[04:56] uh whales playing some games some paper
[04:58] Bitcoin and and and I think it's just
[05:00] because we're early to Bitcoin it's just
[05:02] nobody understands that's why I say you
[05:05] know, we we have no idea how early we
[05:08] are on the on the on the timeline, you
[05:10] know what I mean? And it's just
[05:12] incredible to me for us to be picking up
[05:14] all these Satoshi's at these incredible
[05:15] prices. It's just great. What What do
[05:18] you actually think is it's a really
[05:20] interesting thought experiment? Let
[05:23] let's say we all have microchips in our
[05:25] head and we distribute the Bitcoin uh
[05:29] segment of of the of the micro ship and
[05:32] everyone gets the Bitcoin upgrade over
[05:35] air. What do you think actually happens?
[05:37] Like what people actually waking up and
[05:40] the price I I don't even know what the
[05:42] price will be if everyone all of the
[05:44] sudden starts buying. Well, whoever
[05:46] whoever's got the most quote unquote
[05:49] fiat currency obviously will get the
[05:50] most. Uh the United States of America
[05:53] has the world reserve currency. So we're
[05:55] in a pretty good uh a little bit of an
[05:58] advantage, first mover advantage because
[05:59] we have a little bit more capital
[06:01] because we can buy more SS per dollar. I
[06:03] think the euro might be up there too
[06:04] right now. But uh what I think would
[06:07] happen is we we we'd be in a uh a world
[06:11] where people really understood what a
[06:12] supply shock is, right? I mean, when
[06:14] you're dealing with a finite item as
[06:16] Bitcoin is, and you got the United
[06:18] States got a couple hundred thousand,
[06:20] China's almost got a couple hundred
[06:21] thousand. Uh, Strategy's got over a half
[06:23] a million. The ones that are missing,
[06:26] uh, Satoshi has over a million. Um,
[06:28] there's, you know, Howard Lutnik said
[06:31] he's got billions of dollars or hundreds
[06:32] of millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Who
[06:34] knows? Uh, Max Kaiser's got a bunch. You
[06:37] know, there's people that just have a
[06:38] bunch. And uh we would quickly realize
[06:41] that and I said this I said this before
[06:43] on one of my shows that I think if
[06:45] everything was distributed
[06:47] evenly with all the coins lost and
[06:49] everything I just said that are not
[06:51] moving the stoies that are not
[06:53] moving I think if it was had to be
[06:56] distributed evenly it may be maybe 5 to
[07:00] 15,000 sats per person maybe. So again,
[07:04] we'd wake up with a big supply shock and
[07:06] the people that already put back
[07:07] Bitcoin, I think they'd be uh they'd be
[07:09] very happy. That's an such an
[07:12] interesting um experiment, thought
[07:14] experiment to go through what happens if
[07:17] people actually realized Bitcoin because
[07:20] they don't what do you think is kind of
[07:22] hurting adoption right now? How do you
[07:24] look at Bitcoin adoption? We don't have
[07:26] a marketing team and people just don't
[07:28] understand uh the problem that we have.
[07:31] Again, when you have a solution to
[07:34] something, that's what Bitcoin is, is a
[07:35] solution. Uh when people don't know what
[07:38] the problem is, uh that's the problem
[07:40] with with adoption because this thing is
[07:42] not going to do anything until regular
[07:44] folks like us buy it, right? If you walk
[07:47] down the street right now and ask, you
[07:48] know, a thousand people, cuz I live in
[07:50] Las Vegas, I got my little picture up
[07:52] here. Um, if I walked down the Las Vegas
[07:55] strip and asked a thousand people what
[07:56] inflation is, I would say 850 of them or
[08:01] more would say prices are going up or
[08:04] they don't really understand what the
[08:05] real answer is. And I think that's the
[08:08] problem with adoption. People don't know
[08:10] uh what the the problem is. That's the
[08:12] base layer of it. The second part of the
[08:15] adoption is people uh just don't
[08:17] understand what Bitcoin is because they
[08:19] a lot of people listen to, you know, the
[08:21] mainstream media and they're not pumping
[08:24] out Bitcoin. I think Trump is also
[08:26] slowing down adoption. I made a video
[08:28] about that. If we if you want to get
[08:30] into that, I will. Uh not because, you
[08:33] know, he's doing anything bad. It's just
[08:34] because they painted him as a bad guy
[08:36] for so long that anything he's attached
[08:38] to, they just hate it. But I just think
[08:41] people when they look at the price of
[08:43] Bitcoin at 45,000, 85,000, 109,000,
[08:47] 68,000, whatever it is, I just think
[08:50] they think it's just too much money. And
[08:51] people don't understand that you can buy
[08:53] the little Satoshi's. That's why I say
[08:54] Bitcoin is just a marketing name.
[08:56] Satoshi's is the real money. So I think
[08:58] it's layers of it of why the adoption is
[09:00] slow. But I think eventually with people
[09:02] like you doing your channel, uh, doing
[09:04] your show every single day and us just
[09:06] being out here on the streets, I think
[09:08] us, you know, trying to defeat the FUD
[09:11] that is in the mainstream media and just
[09:13] showing people that they've been lied to
[09:15] every single, uh, day of their life, uh,
[09:19] you know, about inflation and prices
[09:21] going quote unquote up and stuff like
[09:22] that. They really understood what
[09:24] inflation is. I think if we teach them
[09:25] and they understand, I think that will
[09:27] definitely help, uh, Bitcoin's adoption.
[09:30] It's interesting alo also the the supply
[09:33] shock element of it, but I want to uh
[09:36] before we get into supply shock and
[09:38] adoption a little bit, I I want to stay
[09:40] on the America topic because it's super
[09:42] interesting for me as a European to
[09:43] watch what's going currently on with
[09:45] with Trump. Uh I mean, we have now this
[09:48] tariffs and and I can I can just tell
[09:51] you the the the Europeans are very
[09:54] afraid of tariffs. It's like the worst
[09:56] thing. Uh people in the mainstream media
[09:59] of Europe are talking about this tariffs
[10:01] as Trump would launch missiles on
[10:04] Europe. It's it's the it's the same
[10:07] thing. And they also talk about a tariff
[10:10] war. They're talking about a trade war,
[10:12] which I'm like, it's not a war. He says
[10:15] tariffs. Terrorists is something normal.
[10:17] I I'm might be an a proponent for zero
[10:21] tariffs on on every side, but I don't
[10:24] know if this ever happens. Um, so that's
[10:27] a legit thing for for him to do. How do
[10:29] you look at uh his politics and the
[10:31] influence it has on on on Bitcoin? Yeah.
[10:35] Well, I think he's doing a great job.
[10:37] First of all, um he's he's only reacting
[10:39] to a situation that he's put in he's
[10:41] being put into, right? you know, the
[10:43] system is obviously broken, especially
[10:45] the um economy and the fiat system that
[10:47] we're in with the 36 almost $7 trillion
[10:50] debt we're in. But as far as tariffs go,
[10:53] um I don't like tariffs personally. I
[10:55] believe in free trade and the free
[10:56] market. Uh but if somebody's willing to
[10:59] pay the tariffs, I think it's an open
[11:01] market. I think they should be able to
[11:02] do that. Do I like the tariffs
[11:04] personally? No. I don't like any country
[11:06] tariffing each other. I believe in free
[11:08] trade where Robin if you make something
[11:10] and I like that product and I make
[11:12] something and you like my product I
[11:14] think we should be trading back and
[11:15] forth. The problem is in as far as
[11:18] America is concerned for decades since
[11:20] 1975 the year I was born uh we've been
[11:23] in a major major trade deficit major
[11:25] trade deficit and a tariff just real
[11:28] quick tariffs are not inflationary okay
[11:30] people think oh it's going to be
[11:31] inflationary yes some products prices
[11:34] will go up but a tariff is a tax right I
[11:36] will say that it's a tax on imports
[11:38] coming in but inflation is only comes
[11:41] from one place in in America and that's
[11:42] Washington DC and that's the money
[11:44] printer it devalues your currency A
[11:46] tariff does not de deval currency. It's
[11:48] just a tax on the uh price of the good
[11:50] or you know the good that you're buying.
[11:52] But I like the fact that Trump is doing
[11:54] the reciprocal tariffs because what he's
[11:56] doing Robin is this. He's he's if you
[11:59] ever work uh read the book the art of
[12:01] the deal, he talks about it in the book
[12:02] and he's been talking about this for
[12:03] decades about the tariffs and what he
[12:05] do. He's basically saying look we have
[12:08] the biggest market in the world, the
[12:09] United States of America. We consume
[12:11] everything. I mean, we have the the
[12:13] world reserve currency. Uh our our GDP
[12:17] per capita per person is the highest in
[12:19] the world. China has a big economy, too,
[12:22] but nowhere near as as as per person as
[12:24] America. I know China's a big country
[12:26] and has a lot more people than us, but
[12:28] nobody spends like us. I mean, nobody.
[12:30] We buy everything. We consume everything
[12:31] and then we send our dollars out to get
[12:33] these things, right? But what the
[12:35] tariffs are doing to me as far as what
[12:37] Trump is doing, it's a negotiation
[12:39] tactic. That's just what it is. He he
[12:41] put a bunch of tariffs on on a bunch of
[12:43] countries that didn't even have tariffs
[12:45] on us. Why? Because some of that that
[12:47] stuff that China goes through, they
[12:49] trade through these little, you know,
[12:50] the Panama Canal and different countries
[12:52] and they'll try to seep through to these
[12:55] countries and he said, "Look, you can't
[12:56] even go through here." Cuz the the main
[12:57] thing he's doing for the tariffs, he's
[12:59] doing it for China. Period. End of
[13:01] story. It's all about China. Yeah, the
[13:02] little other little countries here and
[13:03] there, we've been being fleeced by them
[13:06] as far as America goes. But what he's
[13:08] trying to do, he's trying to make a
[13:09] negotiation tactic. to say, "Okay,
[13:11] you're you're charging us this, we're
[13:13] going to charge you that." Right?
[13:15] Because they don't want they don't want
[13:16] to lose our market. Any country in the
[13:18] world that sells us a product, they do
[13:20] not want to lose access to I don't know
[13:22] 70 80 90% of their sales coming to to
[13:25] you know total coming to America. They
[13:28] don't want to lose that because we we
[13:30] spend the most. So what Trump wants to
[13:33] do is number one is he wants them to
[13:34] drop their tariffs down to zero like you
[13:36] said. So we could do that, make other
[13:38] deals with the country, but the main
[13:40] reason he's doing it is because China is
[13:42] the main country that tariffs us the
[13:44] most. They tariff us big time and we
[13:46] make so much and we make so much we buy
[13:49] so much from China that I think he wants
[13:52] us to be independent, declare our
[13:54] independence from China because again if
[13:56] something happens with a war or a big
[13:59] conflict or something and we need to
[14:00] make our own stuff, we don't have the
[14:02] ability right now to do that. So what
[14:03] the tariff is doing is say okay we need
[14:05] to declare our independence from China.
[14:06] We need to build our own ships here
[14:08] instead of getting them from Taiwan. Uh
[14:10] we need to build our own military stuff
[14:12] and everything else. But at the end of
[14:13] the day uh we need to make and we need
[14:16] to make and buy American products.
[14:18] That's what he wants to do. Now again
[14:20] there's nothing wrong with you know you
[14:22] focus on that over there in this
[14:24] country. You you your main thing is that
[14:26] product and we can't make that. That's
[14:27] fine if there's zero tariffs in between.
[14:29] But if you're charging us 40% on every
[14:32] item that you're selling us and we're
[14:34] not getting anything back, what Trump is
[14:36] trying to do is trying to uh make it a
[14:39] not a trade deficit, but make it even,
[14:42] right? He doesn't want a surplus, right?
[14:45] Because we've been in a deficit with
[14:46] these countries. He just wants to make
[14:47] it even, making it fair, and most
[14:49] importantly, be independent from other
[14:51] countries. That's what I believe.
[14:54] and and what's your thoughts on on the
[14:56] impact he had on on Bitcoin and the
[14:58] strategic Bitcoin uh reserve around this
[15:02] what they're doing and also maybe the
[15:03] the Lumis bill. Okay. Yeah. I think with
[15:06] the SPR, it wouldn't happen without
[15:08] Donald Trump. Okay. Now, Donald Trump is
[15:11] I'm going to make a video about this.
[15:12] Donald Trump is a lot like Bitcoin,
[15:15] right? He's the orange man. It's the
[15:17] orange coin. He's a politician, right?
[15:21] and Bitcoin is crypto even though he's
[15:25] not really a politician and Bitcoin is
[15:27] not really crypto. You know, Bitcoin
[15:29] can't be controlled. Trump really can't
[15:31] be controlled. They're both kind of
[15:33] decentralized. They do what they want,
[15:35] you know, stuff like that. But when it
[15:37] comes to SPR, we would not have the
[15:38] strategic Bitcoin reserve without Trump.
[15:40] That's an executive order, right? I I I
[15:43] love that fact. He has a lot of smart
[15:45] people around him, man. his his cabinet,
[15:48] my goodness, is filled up with
[15:50] Bitcoiners. Uh Howard Lutnik and Scott
[15:53] Pent, my goodness, man. He's got an A
[15:55] team with his with his cabinet, right?
[15:58] But the strategic Bitcoin reserve, which
[16:00] which I like, uh is the fact that he
[16:04] separated that from uh the stockpile of
[16:07] crypto because remember he made an
[16:09] announcement maybe a few days before he
[16:11] signed the executive order. He was like,
[16:12] "Oh, we're just going to put them
[16:13] together." And I was like, "What?" you
[16:15] know, but he didn't do that. He signed
[16:17] an executive order, which again, we have
[16:18] to get it passed through the through the
[16:20] bill. I mean, through the Congress, like
[16:21] you said, with the Bitcoin Act, with
[16:23] this the Lumus bill. Uh, but again,
[16:25] without Trump, we wouldn't have that. I
[16:27] think Trump knows a lot about Bitcoin. I
[16:30] think he, as far as Bitcoiners are
[16:32] concerned, he doesn't know as much as we
[16:35] want him to know, but when it comes to
[16:37] the normies, he knows more than they
[16:39] than they think he knows. So, he's kind
[16:41] of in between. But if you notice when he
[16:43] was signing it, when he was signing the
[16:46] strategic Bitcoin reserve, it was kind
[16:47] of later at night. It was just just came
[16:49] out all of a sudden. And he was kind of
[16:51] real nonchalant like, "Yeah, I'll do
[16:52] this and this is something we want to
[16:54] do, right? You believe in this?" He's
[16:55] like, "Okay." He's kind of half, you
[16:57] know, halfassing it like, "Yeah, okay,
[16:59] whatever." Like basically taking a
[17:01] nonchalant like if something happens to
[17:03] this, it's not really my fault. I mean,
[17:05] you you said it. I'm not taking a lot of
[17:07] responsibility and oh, this your little
[17:08] thing. Have fun with your Bitcoin. Okay,
[17:10] I'll sign it here. He's like really
[17:12] nonchalant about it. The body language
[17:13] was a out, you know, just crazy, right?
[17:17] And I was just like, hm. And I watched
[17:19] it over and over and over again. And and
[17:20] Trump is a uh he's a very very smart
[17:23] guy. He knows exactly that. Every little
[17:25] word, every little movement he does is
[17:27] going to be recorded and going to be
[17:28] analyzed. I think he did that on
[17:30] purpose. But as far as the Bitcoin Act
[17:32] is concerned, I think we need to get
[17:33] that up through Congress as quickly as
[17:35] we can. And we're going to see who's
[17:37] really for it, Robin. we're going to
[17:38] see, you know, cuz again, it's not about
[17:40] Republicans and Democrats here in
[17:42] America. I don't believe I believe it's
[17:43] establishment versus
[17:45] anti-establishment. And if you're an
[17:47] anti-establishment person, you're
[17:49] against Bitcoin. You're against freedom,
[17:51] right? That's why I call my show Jerry
[17:52] Loves Freedom because Bitcoin is freedom
[17:55] money. And I believe that Donald Trump
[17:57] and MAGA, Make America Great Again,
[18:00] portion of the um of the party and some
[18:03] there's some Democrats in there, too,
[18:04] are for freedom. So, we're going to see
[18:07] we're going to see some Republicans that
[18:08] are not going to sign this bill.
[18:10] Obviously, probably all the Democrats
[18:11] are not. But in order to get this
[18:13] adoption going and getting us the
[18:15] superpower in America, we got to get as
[18:16] many Bitcoin as we can through the
[18:18] Bitcoin Act and Cynthia Lumis and Donald
[18:20] Trump. That's that's such a fascinating
[18:22] topic with with adoption also. How do
[18:25] you look at uh where we are currently? I
[18:29] mean, people always saying like, oh, we
[18:30] at 3%, I don't believe it. I think we
[18:33] are like 0.5%.
[18:35] Where where where are we currently in
[18:37] the adoption? I think about that often
[18:40] and I've come to one conclusion. Uh
[18:42] nobody knows number one. But number two,
[18:45] I think you have to break it up into
[18:48] different categories. When we talk about
[18:50] adoption, number one is how many people
[18:53] actually know about Bitcoin? That's the
[18:55] first layer. Because I talked to I I've
[18:56] talked to a lot of people out here, Rob.
[18:58] When I asked them, have you ever heard
[18:59] of Bitcoin? And if I asked a thousand
[19:01] people, I'd say 850 of them heard of
[19:04] Bitcoin. Right now, out of those 850 or
[19:07] more that heard about Bitcoin, if I
[19:09] asked them, "What is it? What is
[19:11] Bitcoin?" A lot of them will say a
[19:13] stock. Some of them will say a
[19:15] cryptocurrency. Someone will say, "I
[19:18] don't know, but I know it's some kind of
[19:19] internet money or something." You know,
[19:21] they'll have some kind of clue of what
[19:23] it is. Now, out of those people that
[19:26] actually kind of know what it is, then
[19:27] you got to say, "Okay, what is it
[19:28] really?" And you, you know, you break it
[19:30] down like that. And then for those that
[19:33] really really understand it and then you
[19:34] got to, you know, break it down into
[19:36] that little group. Then you look at that
[19:38] group and say, "Okay, well, how many of
[19:39] you guys that really know what it is own
[19:43] Bitcoin?" Right? And then they'll say,
[19:46] "Oh, you know, I I own it." Or, "Oh, I
[19:48] had a little bit." Or, "Oh, I had some
[19:49] and I sold it." Or whatever. And then
[19:50] you got to shrink them down again. Then
[19:52] once you get to that group that have it,
[19:53] say, "Okay, you have it. Where are you
[19:54] storing it at? How long have you had it?
[19:57] What's your knowledge on it?" right?
[19:59] What's your plan on selling it? What
[20:00] you're doing? And then they'll say, "Oh,
[20:02] you know, I got it on Coinbase or I got
[20:04] it on there." I say, "Okay, take those
[20:06] people away." And the people that have
[20:07] it actually on cold storage, put away,
[20:09] locked away, say, "Okay, well, what's
[20:11] your plan for it?" And some people,
[20:13] believe it or not, even that have it on
[20:15] cold storage will say, "Oh, you know, I
[20:16] bought it at 100. You know, it's at 8079
[20:20] now, so I'm waiting for it to go back to
[20:22] 100 so I can sell it and break even."
[20:23] You're like, "What?" Right? Literally,
[20:27] I've I've talked to people like that.
[20:28] Then you kind of get rid of them and
[20:30] then you get down to people like me and
[20:33] you that got it knowing that they're
[20:35] going to keep it forever and stuff like
[20:36] that. So, with that being said, like you
[20:38] said, Robin, I think it's less
[20:40] than it's less than a half% of people
[20:43] like that. So my my goal on my channel
[20:46] and my life is to make sure we get as
[20:49] many people like me and you uh to fully
[20:52] understand it, keep it away in cold
[20:53] storage, and to never never sell it like
[20:55] Donald Trump and uh Michael Sailor says.
[20:58] Yeah, we are we are the the social layer
[21:01] of Bitcoin. We are the protectors of
[21:03] Bitcoin.
[21:05] We we are that hard core that won't back
[21:10] off and and and we are the annoying
[21:13] crowd that always keeps pushing. Oh, you
[21:16] need self custody. Oh, you need uh full
[21:19] node. You you need that. You should do
[21:22] that. and and and it's uh sometimes hard
[21:26] to be in that position of where you are
[21:28] always the the the the pusher and the
[21:31] the toxic maxi basically trying to to
[21:34] get get the Bitcoin story around. Uh uh
[21:38] but it's it's very important that
[21:40] Bitcoin that that we have that hard core
[21:44] Bitcoiner crowd and there Jeff Puera
[21:47] because I asked him actually how how
[21:49] many people do we need uh to run their
[21:52] own full node? How many people do we
[21:55] know need that have a Bitcoin mining
[21:57] operation solar mining with ocean stuff
[22:00] like that? And he said in a network
[22:03] there's always 2% that are that you
[22:07] cannot pay off. There's like 2% that no
[22:10] matter how much you give them they won't
[22:13] change the principles. 98% they will
[22:17] change the principles if you pay a
[22:19] certain amount. And I think we have to
[22:21] be that hard layer of of Bitcoin, that
[22:24] hardcore layer that says if Blackro
[22:26] comes to you and says, "Oh, here's a
[22:29] million, but please now talk about that
[22:32] on your podcast." You say, "No, because
[22:35] you believe more in Bitcoin than you
[22:37] believe in whatever this million dollar
[22:39] gives you." So you you your your opinion
[22:42] and your stands are not for sale, which
[22:45] is a really hard thing. And then I think
[22:47] there are not a lot of people that uh
[22:48] that would do that. Very small
[22:51] percentage. Yeah. And again, that's
[22:52] that's where we're at. But it takes uh
[22:55] like Bitcoin's uh main layer of learning
[22:59] is it's proof of work, right? And it
[23:01] takes time to get there. You know, when
[23:03] I when I first started, I started in
[23:05] February of 2021. I started as a
[23:07] precious metal stacker. And I had
[23:09] learned in the summer of 2020 uh when I
[23:12] first got into precious metals that the
[23:14] the money was broken and gold and silver
[23:16] were the way I thought, you know, cuz I
[23:18] didn't had no idea what quote unquote
[23:19] cryptocurrency was. And it took me u
[23:21] months and months of studying to not
[23:23] only unlearn what I've been taught for
[23:26] the first 45 years of my life because
[23:28] that's what you have to do in order to
[23:29] learn something. You have to first get
[23:30] rid of the what you learned and get rid
[23:32] of the bad ideas to put in a new idea.
[23:34] Right? So I learned what inflation was.
[23:37] I learned what real money was. I learned
[23:39] what the difference between money and
[23:40] currency and stuff like that was and my
[23:43] conviction grew. But once I got into
[23:45] Bitcoin and I learned about it, it took
[23:47] me a few years actually over two years
[23:50] to finally realize that even though I
[23:52] loved gold and silver and it was great,
[23:54] I had to sell it and get rid of it and
[23:56] put it I put it all into into Bitcoin.
[23:59] And that takes time, right? So people
[24:02] have to understand that when you see
[24:04] someone like me and you at the stage
[24:06] that we're at, you know, man, that
[24:09] person really put I mean I mean how many
[24:13] hours have you put in, Robin? Hundreds,
[24:15] thousands, right? Even just with this
[24:17] podcast alone, I I can't tell you how
[24:19] many hours I put in not only studying
[24:21] it, reading about it, listen to the
[24:23] podcast, but actually trying to teach
[24:25] others, talk about it, thinking about
[24:27] it. Um, so it's crazy. So yeah, for me
[24:31] it's all about that proof of work and
[24:32] the time put in to get there. You know,
[24:34] when you go to the gym and you see a
[24:36] guy, whatever stage they're at, you see
[24:38] this really big muscular guy, uh you
[24:40] know that that's proof of work. He
[24:41] didn't he didn't cheat that process. You
[24:43] know, he had to, you know, not besides
[24:45] steroids, but people that are really in
[24:47] the gym, you know that took them years
[24:49] to get where they're at. It's not about
[24:51] how many Satoshi's you have stocked up
[24:52] in a stockpile because you can get a
[24:54] multi-millionaire that heard about these
[24:55] Bitcoin things. I actually know a guy
[24:57] like that. I kind of kind of orange
[24:59] build him. he just bought a bunch, you
[25:00] know, bought a bunch of Satoshi's, but
[25:02] again, he doesn't have the conviction
[25:04] and he doesn't know what we know. So,
[25:06] again, it's at the end of the day to get
[25:08] to where we're at, uh, we got to put the
[25:10] work in. And it's all about the proof of
[25:11] work. It really is. You need the reps to
[25:14] really understand what what this is
[25:16] about. And yeah, I've never thought
[25:18] about it how many hours of learning I
[25:20] put into Bitcoin. I mean, the podcast
[25:22] alone is around 500 hours. So, uh, and I
[25:26] was in Bitcoin 4 years before I even
[25:29] started the podcast. And I did Twitter,
[25:31] uh, daily, uh, for a year before I
[25:34] started the the
[25:35] podcast. And I listen to so many and I
[25:39] read books and stuff like that. So, I'm
[25:41] probably about a,000 hours at this
[25:43] point.
[25:44] But uh this this is kind of kind of
[25:47] crazy to think that you put like so much
[25:49] hours into studying one thing but then
[25:52] this is the way of you becoming actually
[25:55] really good. How do you think about in
[25:57] America um of the transition of the US
[26:01] dollar to a Bitcoin standard? Well, what
[26:04] what I would like um us to do, and I
[26:07] don't think it would happen in this uh
[26:10] presidential epoch 5 bitcoin cycle
[26:13] because it's crazy that they they go
[26:16] together and I don't think that was on
[26:17] accident. I really
[26:18] don't. Is this I I would like my dream
[26:22] would be the United States to pick up as
[26:24] many Satoshi's as we can for the for
[26:26] this next epoch or next presidential
[26:28] Trump's last um run this cycle. get as
[26:33] many as we can in in the in the
[26:35] Strategic Reserve through the Bitcoin
[26:37] Act and then
[26:40] once 2029 starts when maybe JD Vance or
[26:45] whoever is in office cuz he's a
[26:47] Bitcoiner as well. I would like to
[26:50] uh set a a new US dollar based on a
[26:54] Satoshi, right? And this is my dream. I
[26:56] would love to have to run a whole new
[26:59] dollar for one Satoshi equals $1. Okay,
[27:03] I know that sounds crazy right now, but
[27:05] move the decimal points back on Bitcoin
[27:08] to two decimal points back. make a
[27:10] hundred micro or fractal or fractional
[27:14] Satoshi's in every uh Satoshi, a 100
[27:16] units, like a 100 pennies, and then
[27:18] issue the new dollars uh backed by every
[27:22] Satoshi in the uh cold storage of of
[27:25] basically America's um you know, uh
[27:29] Bitcoin
[27:31] uh um vault, right? And so everybody can
[27:35] see what we have and then repric it like
[27:37] that and then be have it become uh the
[27:40] American dollar backed by Satoshi and
[27:42] then have it, you know, written down on
[27:44] there what it is. You know, every dollar
[27:45] is backed by Satoshi's or whatever. And
[27:47] we can only issue more of those dollars
[27:49] based on how many Satoshi's we have in
[27:51] the in the in the vault. And I think
[27:53] that's the way to go in the in the
[27:55] future. Now, if will that happen? I
[27:57] don't know. It may happen in the second
[27:59] uh uh cycle. maybe epoch uh seven maybe
[28:04] and or JD Vance's second term. But that
[28:06] would be my dream. One sat equals $1.
[28:09] Bring the decimal point back twice and
[28:11] then uh people even the people that
[28:14] don't buy early like us cuz a lot of
[28:16] people are not going to do it, Robin.
[28:17] They're just not going to going to do
[28:19] it. But at at the least, what they can
[28:21] do is now is they can work and
[28:23] everything number one is going to get
[28:24] cheaper over the over the months and the
[28:26] years and the decades. That's number
[28:27] one. But number two, they can actually
[28:30] not invest anymore, right? They don't
[28:32] have to invest because all investing is
[28:34] is just keeping up with the money
[28:35] supply. If you look at the S&P and all
[28:38] this other stuff, it's just to me it's
[28:39] just a scam. It's just correlated with
[28:41] the money supply. As it quote unquote
[28:43] goes up, it's going up with the money
[28:45] supply, but the dollars that it's going
[28:46] up and are losing purchasing power. It's
[28:48] just what it is. So I think um it would
[28:51] take a lot of uh energy and money out of
[28:53] the uh investment portfolios of real
[28:56] estate and uh stock market and
[28:59] everything else and it'll put it into
[29:01] back in the hands of the people and
[29:03] people can literally have a checking
[29:06] account with Satoshi's to pay their
[29:07] bills and then they can have a savings
[29:09] account with Satoshi's and pay their
[29:10] bills and not have to worry about
[29:12] investment. put the extra surplus away
[29:15] into a savings account with Satoshi's
[29:18] and not only not have to invest like I
[29:19] said before ever again but now they can
[29:22] save and uh keep their purchasing power
[29:26] and also increase their purchase power
[29:28] over the years using
[29:30] Satoshi's and this is a thing that a lot
[29:33] of people actually don't get the world
[29:36] on a Bitcoin standing standard is
[29:38] getting so much better even for the last
[29:42] person that is transitioning from fear
[29:46] to Bitcoin that it even for the last
[29:49] person it has so many advantages. It's
[29:52] still worthwhile. Obviously, if you are
[29:55] in the first 100,000 people, you will
[29:58] benefit a lot more than the last person.
[30:01] That that's just natural. the the person
[30:04] that first used the printing press is
[30:09] benefiting a lot more than than the last
[30:11] person that printed a book. Uh the first
[30:14] person that used the internet is is use
[30:16] is is way better equipped than the last
[30:19] person is is using internet with
[30:21] electricity. Uh we have now countries
[30:23] that don't have electricity. We have
[30:25] countries that have electricity. those
[30:27] with electricity um are way better uh
[30:31] equipped to they have a way bigger
[30:34] advantage for those who don't have
[30:36] electricity internet or Bitcoin and it's
[30:39] kind of that meme of you show up with
[30:43] you show up with a gun to a fist fight
[30:45] you will win the fight if you show up to
[30:49] any financial tooling rivalry re
[30:53] anything that you're like oh let's let's
[30:55] fight if If you show up with Bitcoin and
[30:58] the other ones have fiat and the other
[30:59] ones have any stocks or any other
[31:02] assets, you will win. You have the
[31:04] better tool for money. So even the last
[31:08] person benefits from Bitcoin. And I
[31:10] think that's
[31:11] something people struggle with because
[31:14] they think only the OGs, only the
[31:16] whales, only the early people benefit.
[31:19] No, everyone benefits. Otherwise, it
[31:21] wouldn't make sense. Yes. Exactly. And
[31:24] again, going to work and trading your
[31:26] time for your energy um for money,
[31:29] that's what energy is and that's what
[31:31] money is, is is crucial for people to
[31:33] understand because if you if we do go on
[31:35] a Bitcoin standard like I I dream of,
[31:38] then people will understand through
[31:40] osmosis just by getting Bitcoin and and
[31:44] learning about it, they'll know that
[31:45] this whole time they've been lied to,
[31:47] right? And they'll know that this is
[31:48] this is the way. So, even though I'm not
[31:51] early and my friend told me about
[31:52] Bitcoin and I'm not a multi multi
[31:55] Satoshi millionaire like him and I
[31:57] didn't listen, at least I know, man,
[31:59] when I go to work, I know that my money
[32:01] and my time is deflationary now, right?
[32:04] I can actually go to work and save and I
[32:05] don't have to worry about investing and
[32:07] stuff like that because again most
[32:08] people on the planet are not going to
[32:11] have a bunch of Bitcoin just like when
[32:13] um Apple stock came out or Amazon came
[32:15] out you know most people didn't take
[32:17] advantage as a first mover advantage but
[32:19] at the same time I I didn't get into
[32:21] Amazon early but I have an Amazon Prime
[32:23] account and I use it and I like it right
[32:26] and it helps me. I it saves me so much
[32:28] time and energy not to have to walk into
[32:30] the store. I can literally just go on,
[32:32] click on, and boom, I can get my stuff
[32:34] within that day sometimes. So, I think
[32:36] this um this new system that we're going
[32:38] to go in, we're going to we're going to
[32:40] go to it no matter what. I the sooner
[32:41] the better hopefully, but I think
[32:43] definitely like you said, it definitely
[32:45] helps people out and um even though they
[32:47] don't have the first mover's advantage,
[32:49] uh it'll still help them in in their
[32:50] life when it comes to saving. Let's take
[32:52] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[32:55] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[32:58] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[33:01] the most amazing, the most eleigent way
[33:04] of showing that you are a true
[33:06] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[33:09] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:11] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:14] collections. You have the date of the
[33:16] first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[33:19] there. And of course, also the block
[33:21] height and which epoch we are currently
[33:24] in. I love the level of detail they put
[33:27] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[33:30] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:33] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[33:35] love those watches so so much. And now,
[33:38] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[33:41] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[33:43] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[33:45] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[33:47] first way is you put it on a hardware
[33:49] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[33:52] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[33:55] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[33:58] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[34:01] if you check out the link in the
[34:03] description, you even get 5% off if you
[34:06] use the code Robin. And the second way
[34:08] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[34:12] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[34:15] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[34:18] They will personalize for you a
[34:20] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[34:23] your individual situation. They will
[34:26] show you how you can secure your own
[34:28] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[34:30] enough. You also have to keep all your
[34:32] devices secure. One topic that is
[34:35] overlooked often is the inheritance
[34:37] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[34:40] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[34:43] a plan for that in place already? And
[34:45] last but not least, if you're in a
[34:47] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[34:50] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[34:52] that, head over to the
[34:56] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[34:58] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[35:01] will be for the first time ever speaking
[35:04] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:07] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:09] really looking forward to seeing all of
[35:11] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:14] the link down in the description of
[35:16] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[35:18] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[35:22] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[35:24] there. Why do you think it's important
[35:26] that America is stacking Bitcoin?
[35:29] There's this notion of do we even want
[35:32] governments to stack Bitcoin? Yeah. And
[35:34] that and that's the that's the the
[35:37] question, right? We we want it to be
[35:39] decentralized. Forget the governments.
[35:40] The governments are bad. Uh, I think
[35:42] with Trump being in office, I think he's
[35:44] kind of changing the guard when it comes
[35:45] to government because people think that,
[35:48] uh, Trump is, you know, the the
[35:50] mainstream media will say he's a, you
[35:52] know, he's a fascist. He's he's, you
[35:54] know, Hitler and all this other stuff,
[35:55] but at the end of the day, what he's
[35:57] trying to do is he's trying to make the
[35:58] government smaller, right? And he's
[36:00] trying to put the power down from the
[36:03] federal down to the state. That's what
[36:05] he's trying to do. That's why he's
[36:06] trying to get rid of um, a lot of things
[36:08] in the federal government, the bloated
[36:10] stuff. But when it comes to Bitcoin, um,
[36:12] we have states already trying to get a
[36:15] Bitcoin strategic reserve or a Bitcoin
[36:17] act put through the states. So, I think
[36:19] it's good for the federal government to
[36:21] have it because again, we want to be on
[36:22] that Bitcoin standard through control of
[36:24] our own self because again, the
[36:25] government doesn't um control our lives.
[36:29] They work for us and we don't work for
[36:31] them. And I think um Donald Trump just
[36:33] by buying Bitcoin and putting it on the
[36:35] balance sheet alone is saying that, hey,
[36:37] we're working for you, right? Right?
[36:39] Because Bitcoin is freedom money. If he
[36:41] was trying to control us, he would not
[36:42] be buying Bitcoin, right? He's using the
[36:45] uh the crypto quote unquote stockpile
[36:48] as, "Hey, we already have it. We're not
[36:50] going to buy anymore. If we compensate
[36:51] it, we'll put it in there." That's a
[36:53] whole another kind of like a little
[36:54] investment. But I think
[36:56] Bitcoin with Donald Trump and with his
[36:59] plan is he's trying to make a freedom
[37:01] money. I think he's trying to give the
[37:02] power back to the people. So, I think
[37:03] it's good for America to do that. But
[37:05] also, I think America, uh, you know, and
[37:08] I'm a proud American saying this, I just
[37:09] think we're the we're the leader, right?
[37:11] We have the biggest economy. We have,
[37:14] um, I think the most kind of most famous
[37:17] people in the world. We're kind of like
[37:18] a trends setters around the world. Every
[37:20] everywhere I've been overseas, I can
[37:22] hear our music playing in people's cars.
[37:25] I can watch uh, movies from our actors
[37:27] and actresses and stuff like that, and I
[37:29] see that. But culturally speaking,
[37:32] America is is kind of the leader where
[37:35] when we do something because it's cool,
[37:37] everybody else will follow. So I think
[37:40] Donald Trump being in office again
[37:42] signing that executive order for
[37:44] strategic Bitcoin reserve and then
[37:45] hopefully this summer we can get the
[37:46] Bitcoin Act up and then we start really
[37:48] buying it. I think it's great for
[37:50] governments to have it because again I I
[37:53] hate to say this but I'm not a big uh
[37:55] democracy guy when it comes to some
[37:57] countries. I believe some countries
[37:58] should have some monarchs, right? The
[38:01] America is a in in an experiment. We're
[38:03] only 248 years old to be 249 this year.
[38:07] And for us to have all this diplomacy
[38:10] and uh you know being a constitutional
[38:12] republic and voting for our our people
[38:14] in office
[38:15] democratic or democracy, I think that's
[38:18] great. And I think um it'll show other
[38:21] countries you can do that as well,
[38:23] right? You can vote for the money you
[38:24] have you want because once people in
[38:27] these countries start buying Bitcoin
[38:28] after the the the arms race happens with
[38:31] America and other countries following
[38:33] suit other people go wait a minute you
[38:36] know Belgium might say we have this much
[38:38] Bitcoin well I want to use that Bitcoin
[38:39] too I want to buy some of that Bitcoin
[38:41] too I want us to be on a Bitcoin
[38:42] standard too. So I think with America uh
[38:45] leading the way, not only will again
[38:48] will it help its own people, its own
[38:49] citizens, but I think the arms race of
[38:52] Bitcoin adoption will start and I think
[38:54] the US being at the forefront being the
[38:56] leader of the of the free world uh will
[38:58] help it Bitcoin's adoption immensely.
[39:01] And it's it's super interesting that you
[39:03] mentioned that because I think the the
[39:05] USA has a lot of power because of the
[39:09] money printer. Yeah, this is a big
[39:12] reason and you are totally right. We I
[39:15] watch u I think every sitcom, every show
[39:20] that I watch is an American. I I think
[39:22] that there's not one European one in
[39:25] there. So fascinating to think about
[39:27] that. And yeah, the music a music a
[39:30] little bit less. Um there's a lot of
[39:32] good music also coming from in in in
[39:34] Europe that I that I that I see and hear
[39:37] but there's a lot of American music also
[39:39] coming in uh with show and movies I
[39:42] think it's it's it's very dominant
[39:43] American and this influences um
[39:47] influences a lot of culture this comes
[39:50] this comes through but the bigger part
[39:52] for me is is the money there are
[39:55] currently what is it 67 countries that
[39:58] only use the US dollar that aren't the
[40:01] United States uh uh United States
[40:04] themselves um like El Salvador did
[40:07] before uh and now they still if you're
[40:11] honest they're still on the the US
[40:12] dollar standard most of them use the US
[40:15] dollar the balance sheet of El Salvador
[40:18] might have some Bitcoin but if you
[40:20] actually look at what they have and how
[40:22] many Bitcoin they have they're mostly
[40:24] still on the US dollar standard even
[40:26] though they're slowly slowly trying to
[40:28] be independent from that and there are a
[40:30] lot of countries that that have that. So
[40:32] the ability from America
[40:35] to export inflation to other countries
[40:39] and import uh the power to them is
[40:43] fascinating. Which brings up the
[40:45] question of how do you think the USA
[40:49] will change on a Bitcoin standard or on
[40:53] the transitioning to a Bitcoin standard?
[40:55] This might also be the reason if Howard
[40:59] Latnik, Donald Trump and all those Viva
[41:02] Swabi, all the the people that are in
[41:03] the administration actually get that. I
[41:06] have no clue if they actually get that,
[41:08] but if they actually get that, then it
[41:10] makes a lot of sense why they are buying
[41:12] Bitcoin. Yes. Yeah, I definitely think
[41:15] they get it. Uh, Vive Ramaswami was at a
[41:18] couple of um Bitcoin conferences, but
[41:21] how I think it would change things, it
[41:22] would change things obviously for the
[41:24] better. I think this version of the
[41:26] Democratic Party in America uh would be
[41:30] destroyed because they are so against uh
[41:33] freedom. They're so against America and
[41:35] they're so against Bitcoin that they
[41:37] would have to change. I'm when I say
[41:38] destroyed, I don't mean like something
[41:40] bad's going to happen to them or the
[41:42] Democrat party is going to fall apart.
[41:43] I'm just saying they'd have to go back
[41:45] to the old way of the Democratic party.
[41:47] I don't I don't really like the
[41:48] two-party system, but it is what it is.
[41:50] It's going to be this way. But I think
[41:52] what'll happen is the MAGA portion of
[41:54] the Republican party will be its own
[41:56] entity and be stronger. And then I think
[41:58] the Democrat party would have to go back
[42:00] to like a uh John F. Kennedy type of
[42:03] party, right? Where they're just, you
[42:05] know, they have a little bit of
[42:06] different ideals than um than the
[42:09] Republicans, but they'd have to adopt
[42:11] Bitcoin. They they just have to. You
[42:13] can't be a party in America if we become
[42:15] the Bitcoin, you know, world leader and
[42:18] we have a strategic Bitcoin reserve and,
[42:20] you know, we're on a Bitcoin standard
[42:22] here in America. You can't be against
[42:24] that because once people see it, you
[42:27] can't unsee it. Jorah from 88 Sats Radio
[42:30] has a great quote uh great saying he
[42:32] says. He says, "Once that green light is
[42:35] turned on, you can't turn it off."
[42:37] Meaning once you understand Bitcoin and
[42:39] you really understand it and that green
[42:40] light comes on, you you you can't unsee
[42:43] it. Just like when you find out, you
[42:45] know, the food pyramid was a lie or you
[42:47] find out all the mainstream media lied
[42:48] to you or whatever kind of lie you
[42:50] figured out and what you found out the
[42:51] truth was, you're like, "Wait a minute."
[42:53] You're going to look back and say, "This
[42:54] whole time these Democrats or whoever
[42:56] were lying to me, right?" So, it would
[42:58] change that way. I think the parties
[42:59] would be closer in line. They'd have to
[43:01] all be on board with Bitcoin. They may
[43:03] have little different things that they
[43:05] argue about, but as far as Bitcoin goes,
[43:07] it' be too many citizens that don't
[43:09] understand it, right? And you can't
[43:10] change that. Now, as far as the citizens
[43:12] will go, like I said earlier, it'll be
[43:14] great for everybody. I mean, the US
[43:16] dollar, um, you know, if if it doesn't
[43:19] go to way the way I wanted to, like
[43:20] Satoshi's, uh, you know, backed by, you
[43:23] know, the dollars backed by Satoshi's, I
[43:25] believe it'll probably be the end of
[43:27] fiat currency if that's the case. And
[43:29] people will be just, I mean, it'd be a a
[43:31] for euphoria, man. It would be just so
[43:33] great. That's that's just my dream, man.
[43:35] You You're making me feel so good even
[43:36] thinking about that because my mission,
[43:40] Robin, I'm I'm just on a mission and I
[43:42] and I advise every single one of you
[43:44] guys to watch this. Every single one of
[43:46] your family, friends, anybody uh that
[43:49] that doesn't understand Bitcoin, uh make
[43:52] sure you help them get as much as they
[43:53] can. You know, we'll probably leave that
[43:55] to the end of the video. But again, I
[43:56] just think the world and our country in
[43:58] particular would be great on a Bitcoin
[44:00] standard. I think it would just be it
[44:02] the changes would be outstanding and um
[44:05] I don't think there would be any kind of
[44:07] conflicts or anything like that. I just
[44:08] think it would be great.
[44:10] Really? Absolutely. What do you mean by
[44:14] by
[44:15] getting helping them to get more
[44:18] Bitcoin is like because it's a hard time
[44:22] to orange pill uh your friends and
[44:24] families. Um, I've noticed actually that
[44:27] I completely stepped away and and don't
[44:29] want to actively Orange pill because
[44:31] everyone knows I'm the the the Bitcoin
[44:34] podcast and if they have question they
[44:36] actually come to me and I've noticed the
[44:39] more time I spend with people the more
[44:42] Bitcoin they
[44:44] have. But I don't Orange pill anymore.
[44:47] It's just when they're around me and
[44:48] they see how Bitcoin improved my life
[44:51] and impacted my life, they like, hm, may
[44:54] maybe I should maybe I should get some
[44:57] maybe I should ask Robin like why
[45:00] Bitcoin? And the people that don't spend
[45:02] that much time with me in in the family
[45:04] because I have a freaking huge family.
[45:07] So I I some I have people in there that
[45:09] I just see once a year or like twice a
[45:11] year, something like that. They
[45:12] obviously they don't spend a lot of time
[45:14] with me. So having that comparison of a
[45:19] cousin of mine that even works with me
[45:21] on the channel, he is really big on
[45:23] Bitcoin and he understands the community
[45:25] and he's really great and he's he's
[45:27] young also. He's around 20. But then
[45:29] there are outside cousins, uncles, aunts
[45:34] that I've not seen for a year. They
[45:37] asking me then at Christmas Eve, "Oh,
[45:40] but it uses too much energy, right?"
[45:43] And and and it's really hard for me not
[45:46] to laugh at that questioning. Like it's
[45:48] it's it's it's almost now hard for me to
[45:50] stay serious if someone tells me this
[45:52] because it's so outlandish for me to to
[45:54] to have that. But it's it's really it's
[45:56] easy to it's really important that we
[45:59] orange pill those people. So how do you
[46:01] look at that and what do you mean with
[46:02] like getting more Bitcoin? Yeah. Well,
[46:05] with me personally, I have a YouTube
[46:07] channel. So I do, you know, I do daily
[46:09] spins and give away Satoshi's. invite my
[46:11] family and friends to come on there. But
[46:13] if you're just a regular pleb and you
[46:15] don't have a a YouTube channel like me
[46:16] and Rob Robin or something like that, um
[46:19] there there's obviously there's
[46:20] different ways to do it. You can
[46:22] actually just buy them some Satoshi's,
[46:24] right? If you just make a list of the
[46:27] most important people in in your life,
[46:30] in the world, right? You know, your mom,
[46:32] your dad, your daughter, your your kids,
[46:34] you know, whoever, right? Put them all
[46:36] down in the list, you know, in in order,
[46:38] friends, family, whatever. And then if
[46:41] you want to set aside, you know, start
[46:43] off with maybe a 100 Satoshi's or a
[46:44] thousand Satoshi's or 10,000, whatever
[46:46] it's good for you, you know, put it away
[46:50] in, you know, different maybe UTXOs or
[46:52] Lightning wallets or something like
[46:53] that. You can do that if they just
[46:54] completely refuse everything you're
[46:56] talking about those people, right? But
[46:58] what I do in my personal life outside of
[47:00] YouTube is I have a a Lightning wallet
[47:03] downloaded on my phone. I have them
[47:05] download it on their phone and then I
[47:08] zap them some sets right now. again
[47:10] saying, "Oh, you need to read the
[47:11] Bitcoin standard. You need to listen to
[47:13] Michael Sailor. You need to do all that
[47:14] stuff." You know, that doesn't work. But
[47:17] if you have a Lightning wallet on your
[47:19] phone and you zap them some sats,
[47:22] whether it's 10 sets, 20 sets, or
[47:23] whatever, and then after a little bit,
[47:25] they're, you know, they see the quote
[47:28] unquote price of the fiat currency
[47:29] underneath of the SATs going up and up
[47:31] and up, and then you making little touch
[47:33] points here and there about it. Every
[47:35] once in a while, you'll bring it up.
[47:36] every once in a while, again, depending
[47:38] on the person, each one. Um, I've
[47:42] noticed that when people have skin in
[47:43] the game, you know, and I tell them,
[47:45] hey, don't do nothing with this. Don't
[47:46] delete the app. Don't sell it. Make sure
[47:48] you give them that caveat. But once they
[47:50] have a little bit of skin on the game,
[47:51] and every time you see them, you know,
[47:53] again, you don't see them that much.
[47:54] Just zap them something, you know, or
[47:56] over the phone, say, "Hey, how you
[47:57] doing? We talking to them, you know,
[47:58] have a regular conversation. Don't bring
[48:00] up Bitcoin." You know, zap them 20 sats
[48:02] or something. You know, it's just again,
[48:05] it's all about them having something,
[48:07] some kind of skin in the game because
[48:09] you're always going to be more
[48:10] interested in what the price is is
[48:12] something if you have it versus not
[48:14] having it. And that's just me
[48:16] personally, what I do. I don't really
[48:17] have all the answers to that, but me
[48:18] personally, that's what I do. But again,
[48:20] if these people just refuse to download
[48:22] a wallet or refuse to do that, I'll
[48:24] just, you know, I have
[48:26] literally Satoshi's put away for the
[48:28] people that I love that just absolutely
[48:30] don't like Bitcoin, but they love me and
[48:32] I love them. And I'm not going to love
[48:34] them and, you know, not look at them the
[48:37] same because they don't have the same
[48:38] conviction of Bitcoin as me. I still
[48:40] love them. So, I'll just say, "Okay, let
[48:41] me give my mom 100,000 sats. You know,
[48:44] she'll be fine. She doesn't want to
[48:45] listen." cuz you know sometimes the
[48:47] older you get, especially, you know, the
[48:48] boomers, they just don't want to hear
[48:50] it. So that's what I do. I just have
[48:52] them download um a wallet, zap them some
[48:54] Satoshi's, and if I love them really,
[48:56] really a lot and they don't want to
[48:57] listen to me, I'll just put some UTXOs
[48:59] away for them. Stack for your family. I
[49:02] love that message. Like stack for the
[49:05] stack for your loved ones that might not
[49:07] get Bitcoin just in case it catches on
[49:10] too much and they don't catch on it too
[49:12] much.
[49:15] Yes, I love this man. I just wake up
[49:17] every day, Robin. I look at the price. I
[49:20] say, "Wow, nobody still knows about this
[49:22] thing." I look at the uh men poolool. I
[49:25] see blocks still coming out. I say,
[49:27] "Nobody stopped it." And I'm just like,
[49:29] "What would I do if I didn't have this?"
[49:32] Like, it literally sucks you into this
[49:34] black hole that you're just like, "Wow,
[49:35] man. I just want to help as many people
[49:37] as I can." Starting with myself first
[49:40] because we are the center of the
[49:41] universe, right? we in the in the in the
[49:43] world and everything starts with you.
[49:46] And so once you I I have to learn as
[49:48] much as I can and be that, you know, be
[49:50] the Bitcoin guy or be the Bitcoin gal or
[49:52] whatever to be that person where people
[49:55] can come to me and say, "Well, I have a
[49:57] question. Can you answer it for me?" And
[49:59] I try my best to do that. And if I
[50:02] can't, I'll look it up. But at the same
[50:04] time, I'm just like, I got to get as
[50:06] many people into this that I love and
[50:08] care about as humanly possible. And it's
[50:10] just like, you know, if you really truly
[50:13] love your family members, which all of
[50:14] you guys do, then again, get them as
[50:17] many Satoshi's as you can humanly
[50:19] possible, but make sure you have as many
[50:20] as you can, learn as much as you can,
[50:22] and take care of your family in the
[50:23] future. I just love it. What a beautiful
[50:27] message. And uh I you're right, that
[50:30] would have been a a great ending point,
[50:32] but I do have uh one one two more topics
[50:37] would love to to go over with you. Um
[50:39] the one thing uh with strategic Bitcoin
[50:42] reserve is the game theory of it. We now
[50:45] discussed what's going on in America.
[50:47] What do you expect from that move as
[50:50] America is highly watched like every
[50:53] secret service agency in the all of the
[50:56] world in every country is watching what
[50:58] the president of United States is
[51:00] saying. They like they're not stupid.
[51:02] They they're watching what America is
[51:04] doing. They're watching every executive
[51:06] orders even though it has been I think
[51:07] over 100 executive orders but they are
[51:10] listening like they they're seeing all
[51:12] the executive orders and seeing what
[51:14] implication does that has. So what do
[51:16] you think has does that has for ripple
[51:20] effects through throughout the world?
[51:22] Well, like I said earlier, I think it'll
[51:24] be an arms race because there's a lot of
[51:27] smart people around the world. And I
[51:28] think every country has some major major
[51:32] Bitcoiners like yourself and your
[51:34] country. Like if you got a call from
[51:36] your I don't know if it's a president or
[51:38] prime minister or something like that
[51:40] and they said, "Oh, I'm look at this guy
[51:41] in my country. Oh, he knows." And they
[51:43] brought you in. I mean, they would get
[51:46] so much knowledge from you be like,
[51:47] "Listen, this is what we need to do. We
[51:48] need to have our own strategic Bitcoin
[51:50] reserve." I think the arms race would be
[51:52] on as far as not only learning as much
[51:54] as they could about what this Bitcoin
[51:56] thing is and bringing the most smartest
[51:57] team in uh but to getting as as as much
[52:00] as they can. Again, I think they'd all
[52:01] be fighting for number the number two or
[52:03] three or four spot because I think
[52:05] America would be number one obviously,
[52:08] but I think China uh would be buying a
[52:11] lot too. So I think again you're going
[52:14] to have some totalitarian countries that
[52:16] uh have you know nefarious actors that
[52:19] have you know central bank digital
[52:21] currencies already with like with China
[52:23] and the and the spy stuff and the um you
[52:26] know uh what is that called when they
[52:28] when they w um when they watch you on
[52:30] Facebook and they don't you know all
[52:32] that stuff that they do right and uh
[52:34] social credit scores and you can't do
[52:36] this and you can't buy this amount of
[52:38] meat or you can't go on this trip
[52:40] because you did this or did that I think
[52:42] those countries uh would suffer a little
[52:45] bit because again when you have leaders
[52:47] like that I don't think they'll let the
[52:49] Bitcoin trickle down to to the people
[52:51] like America and some free countries
[52:52] will u but those countries would
[52:55] definitely would keep it on their
[52:56] balance sheet just to have um power and
[52:59] control over the the world as much as
[53:02] they could as an arms race because again
[53:04] once Bitcoin becomes mainstream you have
[53:07] to have it. I mean you just do. So, I
[53:09] think with the with America passing the
[53:11] strategic Bitcoin reserve cuz like we
[53:12] said, America is a trends setter, you
[53:14] can ask every person in the world um
[53:19] who's who's a who's the president of the
[53:20] United States and pretty much everybody
[53:22] could tell you who's the president of
[53:23] the United States. But if you ask them
[53:25] who's the, you know, leader of
[53:27] Australia, you know, I don't know the
[53:29] leader of Australia. A lot of people
[53:31] don't. So again, with the name Donald
[53:34] Trump buying it and then America buying
[53:37] it, I think not only it'll be an arms
[53:38] race where everybody will be getting it,
[53:40] but I think the uh world will change uh
[53:43] tremendously and um let's just say the
[53:45] Bitcoin price will go up uh very very
[53:47] fast.
[53:50] It I think we have very exciting times
[53:54] ahead to to say the least. Is there
[53:56] actually something you would like to
[53:59] improve on Bitcoin? Not not just on a
[54:03] technical level, but also like
[54:05] community, something that you've looked
[54:07] at that you're like concerned about or
[54:09] something that you would say like, "Oh,
[54:11] we have some potential there." Oh, good
[54:14] question. Uh,
[54:16] communitywise, I would like more of us
[54:19] to be
[54:21] um to do better marketing, I think. Um,
[54:25] even if the marketing was perfect, I
[54:26] still would always want to improve it.
[54:28] But I just think we need to uh have
[54:30] people out there talking about it more.
[54:33] Um, making it simpler to understand and
[54:37] to
[54:39] um just really, again, I don't have a
[54:41] lot of complaints. That's a good
[54:42] question. But I, you know, I love our
[54:44] community. It's it's it's definitely um
[54:48] it's it's a hard thing to learn, but I
[54:49] think the main thing is we need people
[54:52] out there to teach people what inflation
[54:54] is and what our money system is and is
[54:56] broken. So, I think our community can do
[54:58] better. Again, I think we're doing a
[55:00] great job, but this as small as our
[55:02] community is cuz we're a niche uh
[55:04] community. We're very very small in the
[55:05] big picture. It's hard to to imagine
[55:07] that because we're in this little bubble
[55:09] that we're in. Um and all we listen to
[55:11] is Bitcoiners and you know, but once you
[55:14] go out in the street and you realize
[55:15] that nobody knows about this thing, I
[55:17] just try to do the best that I can
[55:18] personally um as one individual to do
[55:22] the best I can to not only teach teach
[55:23] people about inflation, show Bitcoin uh
[55:26] is the solution, but also just try to
[55:29] wake people up to the lies, man. So, if
[55:31] I had to uh do something, I' I'd want
[55:33] people to wear shirts like this. I love
[55:36] that. What does it say? I I will just
[55:38] read it for the people that are just
[55:40] listening. Uh things I do in my spare
[55:42] time. Uh and it's like watch Bitcoin
[55:45] trends, think about Bitcoin, talk about
[55:48] Bitcoin, hold Bitcoin, look at Bitcoin.
[55:51] What is the last one? I cannot read
[55:53] that. Research Bitcoin. Oh, I I love
[55:56] that. I love that shirt. Thank you. So,
[55:59] I wear stuff like this all the time and
[56:01] I think, you know, cuz a lot of
[56:03] Bitcoiners Oh, and this is another
[56:04] thing. Um, a lot of Bitcoiners, which I
[56:07] I don't like, and it's a personal
[56:08] choice, but a lot of Bitcoiners want to
[56:10] ma remain anonymous. And I I just I just
[56:12] don't like that, right? Just just my one
[56:15] of my pet peeves. And I get it because
[56:17] again, you know, whether you know this
[56:19] or not, we're going to be some of the
[56:20] richest people in the world. We just
[56:21] are, right? If you got a million
[56:23] Satoshi's, you're one of the richest
[56:24] people in the world. So, I get it. You
[56:26] want to stay private. You don't want to
[56:27] help. You know, you might talk to a few
[56:29] peoples here and there, but I think we
[56:31] should be branding this because if we
[56:32] want it to be uh we want a Bitcoin
[56:36] standard and we want a to be a global
[56:38] reserve st uh currency because it is a
[56:41] currency. It's a it's a peer-to-peer uh
[56:43] digital currency. Um we got to get out
[56:45] here and talk to more people. So, don't
[56:47] be afraid. Use your skill set, whatever
[56:49] God gave you, right? Because everybody
[56:51] has a skill. I can I can talk a little
[56:52] bit. I can't fix a car, but I can talk a
[56:54] little bit. And um just get out here,
[56:57] use your skill set. tell people, as many
[56:59] people as you can, not only what the
[57:00] problem is, but Bitcoin is a solution
[57:02] and just be a mouthpiece. That's what I
[57:04] think. I actually don't know if we
[57:05] talked about it in the last episode, but
[57:08] how how did Bitcoin actually impact your
[57:11] life, transform your life? I think that
[57:13] that might be interesting. Yes, it
[57:15] changed my life where it gave me a
[57:17] purpose where I am trying to change the
[57:20] world to fix the money. It's it's
[57:23] absolutely consumed me. Um, I just I
[57:28] wake up every day thinking about it. I
[57:31] all day long I'm thinking about it and I
[57:32] go to bed thinking about it. I don't I
[57:34] don't sleep well. Not because I'm not,
[57:36] you know, very very happy and and I
[57:38] worry about things. I can't sleep well
[57:40] because I'm just so excited. So, it's
[57:42] changed my life in so many positive
[57:44] ways. I'm 50 years old right now and
[57:47] what it's done for me, Robin, has made
[57:48] me look at things in fouryear cycles, in
[57:52] fouryear periods. I don't look at things
[57:53] in one year. here. I look at things in
[57:55] four years now. And my goal is to live
[57:58] to be uh 125 years old. And I plan to
[58:01] use some Satoshi's. Yes. I plan to use
[58:03] some Satoshi's to help extend my life.
[58:06] Because again, it's not about how long
[58:08] you've been here. It's about how much
[58:09] time you have left. And it's helped me
[58:11] by eating better, thinking about
[58:13] longevity, um you know, going to the
[58:16] gym, taking care of my body, and being
[58:17] here. You know, everybody wants to live
[58:19] long, but when it comes to Bitcoin for
[58:21] me, it just makes me think like, man, I
[58:23] want to see this thing play out. And you
[58:25] know, there's 21 million Bitcoin, and I
[58:27] want to live to the year 2100 cuz that's
[58:29] I was born 1975. The year 2100, I'd be
[58:33] 125. And I've been looking that up, and
[58:35] uh there are people that have lived that
[58:37] long. And I believe there's going to be
[58:39] technology because of Bitcoin and
[58:41] everything's going to be better and and
[58:43] uh you know, furniture is going to be
[58:45] better. It's just going to be higher
[58:46] quality things. I believe because of the
[58:49] fiat food we eat, if we get on a Bitcoin
[58:51] standard, not only will it give us
[58:52] better food, get off the medications and
[58:55] the pharmaceuticals, uh, but it'll help
[58:57] us live a better life. And I just think
[58:59] everybody be more healthier, the
[59:01] longevity will be better. So, for me,
[59:03] it's just it's just completely changed
[59:06] in a positive way every aspect of my
[59:08] life, and I'm just so I'm just so
[59:09] grateful and thankful uh for Satoshi
[59:11] Nakamoto. I love that. Um, and your
[59:15] channel called is called Cherry Loves
[59:17] Freedom. And I'm really curious uh on
[59:21] that note of of how Bitcoin impacted
[59:24] your life. H how do how do you define
[59:28] freedom? Good question. Freedom is the
[59:30] ability to do what you want when you
[59:33] want without interference from anyone
[59:34] else. You should be a freethinker. Um I
[59:37] believe in freedom of speech. I believe
[59:40] in the uh when we wrote the Declaration
[59:43] of Independence in America, the
[59:45] Constitution. I believe in a free market
[59:48] and trade. I believe in a free um
[59:51] government to let you do what you want
[59:53] to do. The freedom of the pursuit of
[59:56] life uh liberty and you know pursuit of
[59:58] happiness um just to do what you want
[60:01] within the laws, right? There's laws
[60:02] that we have to go by and not infringe
[60:04] on anybody else, hurt anybody else. But
[60:06] I believe that you should be able to buy
[60:08] what you want without somebody telling
[60:10] you what you want to do. I'll be able to
[60:12] go visit your neighbor when you want to
[60:14] go overseas. I can go to your house and
[60:16] visit you. Um less friction in the way,
[60:19] right? I should be able to eat the foods
[60:21] that I want to. No restriction on us
[60:23] whatsoever. And uh just being a
[60:25] sovereign person. You know, there was
[60:26] slavery back in the days and me being an
[60:29] African-American, I remember learning
[60:31] about that in school about, you know,
[60:32] slavery and stuff like that. And I was
[60:34] always thinking like, man, you know,
[60:36] what what what would I have done if I
[60:38] was back then? You know, would I would I
[60:40] have been living in the house with the
[60:42] masters or would I have been in the
[60:43] field? I'd said I wouldn't be either.
[60:45] I'd be trying to um escape and get free.
[60:49] And you know, speaking of slavery, this
[60:52] uh this system we're in is slavery. And
[60:55] to break free of this um you know,
[60:58] there's only one way to do it, and
[60:59] that's Bitcoin. And I say that in all my
[61:01] videos. I always say the best way to
[61:03] save and the only way to save and that's
[61:05] Bitcoin. And Bitcoin to me is the
[61:07] ultimate form of freedom. It is. And I
[61:10] could say Jerry loves freedom. I mean
[61:12] Jerry loves Bitcoin in my show. I could
[61:14] call it that easily. But I don't love uh
[61:17] freedom because I love Bitcoin. I love
[61:18] Bitcoin because I love freedom. And I
[61:20] think it's all about that and the
[61:23] pursuit of that for me. Even when I was
[61:25] sitting in a in a in a classroom, I
[61:27] would always want to get up and walk
[61:28] away. And you know, when I was working
[61:30] at a job, I didn't like sitting at a a
[61:32] cubicle. I like to move around. So, the
[61:34] freedom just to do what you want and to
[61:36] pursue the things that make you happy in
[61:39] life. I think Bitcoin is going to be
[61:41] able to do that with the AIS coming out
[61:43] and everything else. I think it'll just
[61:45] give you time, that limited time that
[61:47] you have on this planet to be free to do
[61:50] whatever you want. So, for me
[61:51] personally, uh, freedom is very, very
[61:53] important, and that's what my channel's
[61:55] all about. I love that. I I really do
[61:58] love that and you embody that so much
[62:01] and I I just want to add to that because
[62:03] it's it's it's so great as you said
[62:07] within the laws. I I'm a big believer in
[62:10] your freedom extends as far as it
[62:12] doesn't interfere with someone else's
[62:15] freedom. And if you then look at what
[62:18] the fiat system is doing where they are
[62:21] extending their own freedom, the central
[62:24] banks are extending their own freedom to
[62:26] print as much money but it is impacting
[62:29] someone else's freedom because they are
[62:31] stealing the purchasing power from the
[62:33] people that save in that currency. And
[62:36] then in that sense because they're
[62:38] stealing uh purchasing power. Purchasing
[62:41] power is money. Money is is energy and
[62:43] time. In that way, yes, everyone that
[62:47] holds fiat currency, I don't know if uh
[62:50] it is accurate to say that, but I think
[62:54] so. Everyone that holds that could be
[62:56] considered a fiat slave because someone
[62:59] else is stealing their time. Exactly.
[63:02] So, uh I'm I'm I'm not a I'm not a
[63:05] historian. I have uh probably not not a
[63:08] good uh understanding of of slavery and
[63:10] and and the history there. But uh from
[63:13] what I understand what the definition of
[63:15] a slave
[63:16] is, I would consider that a slave. Yes.
[63:20] Yeah. And exactly. That's exactly what
[63:22] it is. And Harriet Tubman um you know,
[63:26] she's an American uh black woman. She
[63:28] she escaped uh slavery and but she went
[63:31] back and risked her life for the other
[63:34] slaves and she did the Underground
[63:36] Railroads and she went down there and
[63:38] again she was free, but she said, "You
[63:40] know what? I'm going to reach back and
[63:41] help the other people. And I think um I
[63:44] don't want to call myself the modern-day
[63:46] Harriet Tubman, but I think us
[63:48] Bitcoiners are kind of like that. You
[63:50] know, we know that we're free now, even
[63:51] though we're still in the system, right?
[63:53] But we know that uh Bitcoin is going to
[63:56] free us of that, of the fiat system, the
[63:59] broken system, and we're saving outside
[64:01] of that system with Bitcoin. But I
[64:03] believe in if I was back in the, you
[64:05] know, 1800s or 1700s, that I wouldn't
[64:08] just run away from the plantation. and I
[64:10] would be building something to go back
[64:11] and free as many of those people as I
[64:13] can. And I think uh right now, just like
[64:15] you said, with the with the fiat system
[64:17] being uh slavery, uh right now, that's
[64:19] what I'm doing uh every single day is
[64:21] trying to get people off that uh off
[64:23] that plantation.
[64:24] Absolutely. I love it. Um I think this
[64:27] was not a routine last time and I
[64:31] introduced it later and I now ask each
[64:34] and every one of my guests, what can we
[64:37] learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[64:39] H uh I love America. I love my country.
[64:43] My my things is I love God, family, my
[64:47] family, country, and then Bitcoin in
[64:49] that order. And I I try to be a
[64:52] principled person. Um I think I'm a
[64:55] helpful person. I I have flaws, you
[64:59] know. Um but overall, outside of
[65:02] Bitcoin, I think I just I just enjoy I
[65:05] enjoy life more, you know. I enjoy life.
[65:08] I love people. I'm a people's person. I
[65:10] love talking to people, whether it's
[65:12] about Bitcoin or not. I like to travel.
[65:15] Uh I like good food. I like to eat and
[65:18] um I like to read a lot. I don't always
[65:21] just read about Bitcoin books. I read
[65:22] about um you know, different mindset
[65:25] books and how to be a better person and
[65:27] stuff like that. So, um but I'm a big
[65:30] patriot of the United States of America.
[65:32] I really really I'm very very proud of
[65:34] this country. I'm also as a as a as an
[65:37] African-American male here in this
[65:39] country, uh I'm against um the victim
[65:42] mentality here. Um a lot of people,
[65:45] especially in the Democrat party,
[65:47] they'll try to keep the blacks on the
[65:49] quote unquote plantation where they
[65:51] think that because you're a black man,
[65:54] um you you can't do certain things, you
[65:56] know, and I'm just completely against
[65:57] that. I don't want to, you know, go on a
[65:59] rant about that. But yeah, those are a
[66:01] few things about me that a lot of people
[66:03] outside of uh the Bitcoin stuff know
[66:05] about me. I have uh and I think that's
[66:07] that's awesome. I think and we have an
[66:09] end routine that fits really nicely uh
[66:12] to this podcast where the previous guest
[66:14] is asking a question for the next guest
[66:16] without knowing who the next guest
[66:18] actually is. And the previous guest
[66:19] asked you very uh complicated phrased uh
[66:25] question um but basically he asked you
[66:29] if you had the ability to direct the
[66:32] outcome how Bitcoin is going to be
[66:35] adopted. How would you like to see it
[66:39] happen? Well, we touched on that. That's
[66:42] a good question. Uh I would like the
[66:43] United States of America to have the
[66:45] most Bitcoin. That's the end result. But
[66:47] I think I would love for us Bitcoiners
[66:51] to do what I just said, wear shirts, go
[66:54] talk about Bitcoin, not in a crazy
[66:57] uh you know annoying way, but to get the
[67:01] adoption up as much as we can. Uh get a
[67:04] Bitcoin uh standard here in America.
[67:07] Change the US dollar uh to a to a
[67:10] Satoshi backed dollar. Move the decimal
[67:14] point back twice. and um live a live a
[67:18] good life on the Bitcoin standard. So,
[67:19] if I had to answer that question, I
[67:21] think I pretty much answered it
[67:22] throughout the video, but um yeah, just
[67:26] make people aware of what the problem is
[67:28] with inflation and um just keep working
[67:31] hard at it and and and take time with
[67:33] within yourself because you can only do
[67:35] what you can do personally. You know,
[67:38] develop yourself as much as you can. Get
[67:40] the get the old bad ideals out of your
[67:42] head about the f, you know, the
[67:44] financial system. Know that they lie to
[67:46] you. Do the best you can to learn what
[67:47] you can and to teach others as much as
[67:49] you can and to make sure make sure that
[67:51] you're the leader when it comes to this
[67:53] Bitcoin new freedom money. Awesome.
