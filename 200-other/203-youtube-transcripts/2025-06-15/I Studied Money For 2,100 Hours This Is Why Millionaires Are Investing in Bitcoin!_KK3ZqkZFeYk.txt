[00:00] 86% of Americans believe we should not
[00:03] be buying Bitcoin or they know nothing
[00:05] about it. 14% understand that we should.
[00:08] The adoption wave of Bitcoin, it's the
[00:11] fastest growing adoption of any asset,
[00:14] of any technology, of any platform in
[00:17] history, faster than smartphone
[00:19] adoption, faster than internet adoption.
[00:21] Sailor had a wonderful board that
[00:24] actually was fully in tune with I don't
[00:26] care about the volatility. you know, we
[00:28] have our company, we're profitable,
[00:30] we're going to use our cash, we're going
[00:31] to buy Bitcoin, and we're going to hold
[00:32] it, and we understand it's going to be
[00:34] volatile, but this is the right way that
[00:36] we're going to do it. And you start
[00:37] thinking like, why do I have to lose 50%
[00:39] of my wealth because they believe they
[00:41] can steal from me 2% per year and that
[00:44] that's an acceptable rate of inflation.
[00:46] We're barely getting started. Subund,000
[00:48] Bitcoin is kind of like you starting out
[00:51] with the internet in the late '9s. You
[00:54] manage money for a living and you've
[00:56] missed the best performing asset eight
[00:58] of the last 10 years. How do you justify
[01:01] your fees to the people who you manage
[01:03] their money?
[01:06] [Music]
[01:08] How did you come to uh America? How did
[01:11] you move move to Texas? Yeah. Well,
[01:14] actually, so, uh, my parents originally,
[01:17] uh, lived in New Jersey, uh, and my
[01:20] father, uh, after he was done with his
[01:22] military service, he was a mason. So, he
[01:24] did a lot of, uh, home building, brick
[01:27] laying, construction stuff. And, uh, he
[01:30] was having huge problems with his, uh,
[01:32] health relative to arthritis from the
[01:35] extreme cold and the humidity and a lot
[01:38] of the problems on the east coast. And
[01:40] so without knowing anybody, the doctors
[01:42] said, you know, if you went somewhere it
[01:44] was dry and hot, that would help you a
[01:46] lot. So without knowing anyone, they
[01:48] sort of picked up our family and we
[01:50] moved to Tucson, Arizona. And uh so
[01:53] kindergarten through 12th grade. Uh I
[01:55] had two older brothers and myself and uh
[01:57] we moved out into Arizona. Didn't know
[02:00] anybody and uh started our life there.
[02:02] So uh everything there originated and
[02:06] then uh my parents you know if we were
[02:08] probably upper lower class if we were
[02:11] lucky. So uh they worked really hard. We
[02:14] always had what we needed but uh they
[02:16] gave us the greatest speech in the world
[02:18] uh twofold. It was this is the United
[02:22] States. If you get off your butt and you
[02:23] put in some work you can accomplish
[02:25] anything you want in life. Uh so you
[02:27] have to go put in the work and the
[02:29] effort and anything good can happen.
[02:32] Also, we don't have enough money to send
[02:33] you to college. So, unless you earn the
[02:35] right to go to college, you're going to
[02:37] have to start working or figure it out.
[02:41] So, my oldest brother, you know, worked
[02:43] a full-time job and also went to the
[02:45] University of Arizona and ultimately uh
[02:48] completed his degree. My next brother
[02:51] down went right out of high school into
[02:52] the Navy nuclear program. So he went to
[02:55] nuclear power school and ultimately
[02:57] served operating nuclear reactors on uh
[03:01] submarines in the Navy for about 15
[03:03] years. Uh then he got out and started
[03:06] doing a lot of oil and gas in um the
[03:09] Texas area and currently he's finishing
[03:12] up uh probably the last 12 to 18 months
[03:14] of being an expat for Saudi Aramco and
[03:17] then he's going to retire. Uh and then
[03:20] myself, I uh worked really hard in
[03:22] school after I got that pitch that even
[03:24] my parents said, "Look, even if we had
[03:26] the money, we're still not giving you
[03:27] anything. You have to earn your right to
[03:29] go to college because then you'll
[03:31] appreciate it and you'll work harder."
[03:33] And uh my father was very smart. He took
[03:35] me and my brothers out when he was doing
[03:37] block work and he would make us make the
[03:40] cement. He would make us carry the
[03:42] bricks and the block and do a lot of
[03:43] manual labor. And we said, "You win,
[03:46] Dad. That sucked. We agree. God bless
[03:48] you that you've done this, but we're
[03:50] going to try a different path. And uh so
[03:52] I worked really hard in school. I was
[03:54] fortunate to be the validictorian of my
[03:56] high school class. So that opened up
[03:58] some opportunities. Um I had received
[04:01] Army, Navy, and Air Force ROC
[04:03] scholarships to go to college. And I
[04:05] also got an appointment uh to West
[04:07] Point. So I almost went to the United
[04:09] States Military Academy. One of the
[04:12] senators from Arizona also gave me a
[04:14] congressional nomination to go to the
[04:15] Air Force Academy. I thought I wanted to
[04:17] be a pilot. Uh that was back when the
[04:19] original Top Gun number one came out
[04:21] when I was in high school. And so all I
[04:24] wanted to do was fly. I thought that
[04:25] looked like the greatest thing in the
[04:26] world. And so ultimately I applied,
[04:29] finished everything, and then the
[04:30] University of Miami, which I have the
[04:32] little U on my my chest. Uh they had a
[04:34] unique program where if you would use
[04:36] your ROC scholarship to go to college
[04:38] there, they would pay your room and
[04:40] board. And that was literally all I had
[04:42] left to try to pay. So, without really
[04:45] knowing too much about it, I ended up
[04:46] going to the University of Miami. Uh, it
[04:49] was a small private school. There was
[04:50] probably 10,000 undergraduates. Uh, most
[04:53] people think it's a big public
[04:54] institution like down the street here at
[04:56] the University of Texas where they have
[04:58] like 50 60,000 people. And, uh,
[05:01] ultimately I went there, studied
[05:03] industrial and systems engineering.
[05:05] Fortunately, I did well enough that the
[05:07] army gave me an educational delay and
[05:10] that allowed me to go to graduate
[05:12] school. So I went to engineering
[05:14] graduate school at Georgia Institute of
[05:16] Technology. Uh we always said like the
[05:18] MIT of the South and uh I did really
[05:22] well there. Uh but now the problem was
[05:24] that I had two engineering degrees. So
[05:26] they pulled the needs of the army and
[05:28] they took away my pilot slot which I was
[05:30] commissioned as an aviator and they put
[05:33] me in the core of engineers. Um I then
[05:35] went to my engineering uh officer basic
[05:39] course if you want to call it that. And
[05:42] after completing it, I went to Army
[05:43] Ranger School and then got deployed for
[05:46] my first assignment in Korea uh during
[05:48] the 94 nuclear weapons inspections. So
[05:52] it was like welcome to the real world,
[05:53] you know, first job in life is sitting
[05:55] there dealing with the demilitarized
[05:57] zone on the 38th parallel in Korea. And
[06:00] that was kind of welcome to the world.
[06:02] Um so I did serve for uh 5 years I guess
[06:06] total in the military and then I got
[06:08] recruited to Silicon Valley. Um, I had
[06:11] no intention of getting out of the
[06:12] military. I was going to do company
[06:14] command and continue. Did the airborne
[06:16] aerosol, did a lot of those deployments.
[06:19] And lo and behold, um, I had someone
[06:22] come up to me at an airport in San
[06:23] Francisco and literally beg me to miss
[06:26] my flight. And I was like, why why would
[06:29] I miss my flight? And they're like,
[06:31] we'll pay for it. And I'm like, you'll
[06:33] pay for it? Why? and they're like,
[06:34] "Well, we have a recruiting uh contract
[06:37] with Northern Telecom and they want us
[06:41] to find ex Army, Navy, Air Force, and
[06:43] Marine officers." And so, as it turned
[06:45] out, I ended up in Silicon Valley
[06:47] because 50 of us were hired. Uh 49 out
[06:51] of the 50 were ex military officers and
[06:54] we took control of the enterprise
[06:56] switching business of Nortell in Santa
[06:58] Clara. And that was kind of my foray
[07:01] into technology and my foray into
[07:04] Silicon Valley. And it was the perfect
[07:06] time of life to go there. I started in
[07:08] August of
[07:09] 1996 and then this thing called the
[07:12] internet was going on. So I kind of got
[07:15] buried in the middle of that. Uh long
[07:17] story short is I ended up doing an MBA
[07:20] at the University of California at
[07:21] Berkeley uh while I was working
[07:23] full-time at Northern Telecom as a
[07:25] product manager for what were called
[07:28] private branch exchanges using a
[07:31] technology called ATM. Uh now we use IP
[07:34] like we're talking on now and ultimately
[07:37] it was a lot of voice communication
[07:39] products. Uh, I ended up getting the
[07:42] entrepreneurial bug and when you're in
[07:45] Silicon Valley, it was kind of like
[07:47] you're supposed to start a company. So,
[07:49] a guy that I met at Northern Telecom, he
[07:52] was I jokingly call him my Vietnamese
[07:54] twin, uh, he and I started a voiceover
[07:58] IP company, which is what we're using to
[08:00] talk right here. And we actually left
[08:03] Nortell. We pledged our houses as
[08:05] collateral, got all our Dell and Cisco
[08:08] infrastructure, and then we built the
[08:10] world's first ever voiceover IP platform
[08:12] on Linux, and ultimately that company
[08:16] within two years was purchased for about
[08:18] $130 million from Cisco Systems and then
[08:22] we worked there for a bit. So after, you
[08:24] know, my time in Silicon Valley, um, and
[08:27] then I spent about 5 years there. I
[08:29] spent about seven years in Newport coast
[08:32] and by then I was married. I had four
[08:34] children and I didn't want them to grow
[08:36] up in the People's Republic of
[08:38] California which politically even back
[08:40] in the early 2000s was getting
[08:43] psychotic. So we uh uprooted moved to
[08:47] Texas and that was kind of how I ended
[08:49] up in Austin. uh and then started a a
[08:52] company that ultimately led to uh me
[08:57] doing the same thing all over again with
[09:00] the same group of people. Uh the first
[09:02] three companies we successfully sold
[09:04] first to Cisco systems. We did two
[09:07] contingency business models of the first
[09:09] one was a called a hosted communication
[09:12] provider. Now you would call it the
[09:13] cloud. And we built and sold that to
[09:16] level three communications. And then we
[09:18] also to make the service work uh we had
[09:20] to create a hardware box that would
[09:22] actually do NAT firewall traversal,
[09:25] traffic shaping. And remember back when
[09:27] you used to do these conversations where
[09:29] the video would freeze or the audio
[09:32] would stutter. Uh so we had to optimize
[09:34] and we created a box to actually make
[09:36] sure that you and I could talk without
[09:38] any of those problems on a environment
[09:40] like this. And ultimately that company
[09:43] uh was purchased by um a company called
[09:46] Ribbon Communications. And so I just
[09:49] found myself kind of being a
[09:50] non-reovering serial entrepreneur. Uh
[09:53] and between operating and selling them,
[09:56] um when I finally started a company
[09:58] called Funwear, uh me and our co-founder
[10:01] had made enough money that we just said,
[10:03] "Come hell or high water, this is going
[10:06] from zero to either NASDAQ or the New
[10:08] York Stock Exchange." And so I ran from
[10:12] a founding CEO. We raised $und00 million
[10:15] while we were private. Took it public on
[10:18] NASDAQ and then ran it for another four
[10:20] years including the COVID period. And uh
[10:23] that's just kind of been my life of
[10:25] doing this over and over and over again
[10:28] and then sometimes taking the proceeds
[10:30] and buying assets. uh which is where I
[10:32] got a lot into Bitcoin and then where I
[10:35] also did investments in companies like
[10:37] Vonnage and Ring Central that happened
[10:40] to you know also create services like
[10:42] this because we're using Riverside uh
[10:45] but you and I could have used Go to
[10:46] Meeting or WebEx which is now Cisco Ring
[10:49] Central Vonnage we had all these options
[10:53] and uh I didn't really think I would
[10:55] create a career of entrepreneurship but
[10:57] that was kind of the the short answer of
[11:00] how all that happened. Yeah, that was
[11:03] that was really uh uh and now we really
[11:06] got a good answer to how did you came to
[11:08] taxes and and all that thing. Really
[11:10] really cool. Uh and how did Bitcoin make
[11:13] sense for you with with the military
[11:15] background with uh founding companies
[11:17] with uh the internet adoption, living
[11:19] through the internet adoption? How how
[11:21] did Bitcoin make sense for you there?
[11:24] Well, so there's a number of things.
[11:26] There's a great book that Michael Lewis
[11:28] uh wrote called Liars Poker. He's the
[11:31] same guy that wrote Moneyball and The
[11:33] Big Short, which became great movies.
[11:36] But Liars Poker was all about uh wealth
[11:39] management. And he used to comment being
[11:40] in his 20s knowing absolutely nothing.
[11:43] And they would hand him millions of
[11:44] dollars to manage on behalf of other
[11:47] people's money. And he would get paid
[11:49] 300, 400, 500,000. And he's like, I have
[11:52] no idea what the hell I'm doing. Why do
[11:53] these people give me this money? You
[11:55] know, what what's going on? And and so
[11:57] when you read that book, you sort of
[11:58] realize like, wow, I I really need to
[12:00] learn about money. And I thought I could
[12:03] trust a third party to know what they're
[12:05] doing, but this is a disaster. So, you
[12:08] know, when I had sold the first company
[12:10] to Cisco, uh I took me and about seven
[12:13] other people cuz we made so much money.
[12:15] And you know, I I organized a deal with
[12:18] Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management.
[12:21] So, I was thinking great, like Goldman
[12:23] Sachs, this is the goldplated best on
[12:26] the planet, and I'm going to get to have
[12:28] their help managing my money. And then I
[12:31] realized every time I would go meet with
[12:33] them that I felt like I knew more about
[12:37] the markets and I felt like I had spent
[12:39] more time learning about what was going
[12:41] on in the economy and on Wall Street.
[12:44] And I felt like I was talking to, you
[12:46] know, folks in their 20s who were very
[12:48] well-intentioned, very smart, but they
[12:51] were trained to believe the best product
[12:53] on earth is a Goldman Sachs product. So,
[12:56] oh, you want a fund? Well, it's a
[12:58] Goldman Sachs fund. Um, and if you said,
[13:01] okay, what are physical assets? What are
[13:03] financial assets? What are virtual
[13:05] assets? They would give you a strange
[13:08] look, right? They would just think,
[13:10] okay, physical assets, I get it. you
[13:12] know, gold, silver, real estate, card
[13:15] collections, artwork, you know, okay, I
[13:18] get it. Financial assets, they're like,
[13:20] "Okay, stocks and bonds and ETFs and all
[13:23] these things." And it's like, "Virtual
[13:25] assets? What What are you talking
[13:27] about?" You know, and I'm like, "Well,
[13:30] like digital assets." And they're like,
[13:32] "What do you mean by a digital asset?"
[13:35] And then I'm like, "You know, Bitcoin."
[13:38] And they're like, "Oh, no, no, no. We
[13:40] don't we don't touch that. We we're not
[13:41] allowed to do that. That's very very
[13:43] risky. That's, you know, high risk, high
[13:46] volatility. Like, are you crazy? It's
[13:49] like a 6040 bond portfolio equity split.
[13:54] And I'm just like looking at him and
[13:56] didn't understand it. And what what I
[13:59] really understood after the liars poker
[14:01] and those interactions was that nobody
[14:03] cares about their money more than I care
[14:05] about my money. And I shouldn't be
[14:08] outsourcing the most important part of
[14:10] my life, which is my wealth, my personal
[14:14] sovereignty, and the approach that I
[14:16] take to combat the fraud of every
[14:20] central bank on earth, and the
[14:22] Rothschild family bank, which we like to
[14:25] call the Federal Reserve. Uh, and the
[14:27] more I dove into the history of
[14:29] currencies and money and trading and
[14:34] then watching what I was doing as a CEO
[14:36] in the way private equity worked and
[14:38] venture capital worked and angel
[14:40] investment worked and then when you go
[14:42] on these paths and you end up in the in
[14:44] the public markets on Wall Street, you
[14:46] just realize it's all It's all
[14:50] fraudulent. The whole system is a
[14:52] casino. And the whole concept wasn't
[14:55] that anyone on Wall Street was so
[14:57] brilliant. It was basically that they
[14:59] were getting to do insider trading in a
[15:01] legal way. Uh they could put themselves
[15:04] in their own
[15:06] IPOs. They could manipulate the way IPOs
[15:10] worked as to who got rich and then you
[15:14] know we have to protect you as an
[15:16] institutional accredited investor. So
[15:18] you know Robin you're not allowed to buy
[15:20] that IPO because it's risky. Well, it's
[15:23] risky when it's priced at $15, but when
[15:26] it opens at 60 or 90 or 100, then we'll
[15:30] let you buy, Robin, because now it's no
[15:32] longer risky for you to buy it at 400,
[15:36] 600, 800% higher. And the longer you
[15:39] spend time just peeling back the onion
[15:41] and working through it, um, the more you
[15:44] realize something's terribly wrong. So,
[15:46] with Bitcoin,
[15:48] um, I felt bad that I got into it a
[15:50] little bit late. Obviously, it was
[15:52] around as we were getting through the
[15:54] 2008 explosion of the financial markets
[15:58] during that bubble. That was the bubble
[16:01] after the bubble I saw with the internet
[16:03] and technology in late 2000. Um, and
[16:06] then you kind of realize, okay, these
[16:09] people managing the economy are like,
[16:12] asset bubble, blow it up. Asset bubble,
[16:15] blow it up. Oh, how do we solve the
[16:18] problem? Just print money. Well, wait a
[16:20] minute. when you're printing money,
[16:21] you're stealing from me. And then you
[16:23] start going through all these crazy
[16:25] things about, okay, wait, wh why is 2%
[16:28] inflation, okay? You know, that's just
[16:30] 2% theft. Why? Why? So, so then I
[16:34] started doing the math cuz I'm an
[16:35] engineer, right? And you said, okay, if
[16:38] you and I work from like we're 20 to 70,
[16:41] that's about 50 years. Uh let's say you
[16:44] worked from, you know, 22 to 72 or 18 to
[16:48] 68. Somewhere in there, 50 years. were
[16:50] going to work. 2% inflation because math
[16:53] means that we're going to lose half of
[16:55] our wealth in fiat dollars. Half. And
[16:58] you start thinking like why do I have to
[17:00] lose 50% of my wealth because they
[17:03] believe they can steal from me 2% per
[17:05] year and that that's an acceptable rate
[17:07] of inflation and that was frustrating.
[17:11] uh more recently because math we've
[17:14] watched nearly what 80% of US dollars in
[17:16] the history of the world have been
[17:19] created over the last five plus years.
[17:22] Well, what does that mean? Well, okay,
[17:24] if the target was 2% inflation, you and
[17:26] I could look at the PPI and the CPI and
[17:29] and what the real basket of inflationary
[17:32] goods were. Like when I was born in
[17:33] 1969, if you don't change the
[17:35] definition, inflation was probably 25%
[17:38] or more. So then you're going, "Wow,
[17:41] they're saying two, it's over here at
[17:43] 25." So while I'm running a public
[17:45] company, I assumed our cost of capital
[17:47] was
[17:47] 25%. Per year, whether that was, you
[17:51] know, just a way to be safe or not, that
[17:53] was how we thought of it. But let's say
[17:55] you don't believe 25 is too much, two is
[17:57] too little. Let's pick like 14%. You
[18:00] know, somewhere in the middle. Well, at
[18:02] 14% in 5 years, you lose half of your
[18:05] wealth because math. half in five years,
[18:08] which is what's happened to every
[18:10] American and anyone there that that's
[18:12] pegged to the US dollar. That inflation
[18:15] is devastating. So, Bitcoin to me was
[18:19] like, "Oh god, why did I miss this when
[18:21] it first came out?" And it's mostly
[18:23] because I started the company that
[18:24] became publicly traded on NASDAQ uh
[18:27] February of 2000 or 2009. So, that's
[18:31] really close to when Bitcoin, you know,
[18:33] the white paper was published. Things
[18:34] are starting to get rolling. Um but
[18:37] ultimately I was so consumed in the
[18:39] first five years of building a startup
[18:42] you know raising money we did 20 million
[18:44] the first five years and then we did a
[18:46] couple institutional raises in the next
[18:48] five years of first 20 million then 30
[18:50] million and so forth. So while you're
[18:53] doing that I sort of missed Bitcoin for
[18:55] a while which is crazy because I was
[18:56] from Silicon Valley. I was deeply in
[18:58] technology. I followed all these things,
[19:01] but it was really I I probably got
[19:03] really really deep down the rabbit hole
[19:05] in probably the 2016 happening and cycle
[19:09] going through the 16 happening, the 20
[19:12] happening, the 2024 happening. By now,
[19:15] it feels like really old time. And back
[19:17] when I was getting involved, you could
[19:18] still get Bitcoin, you know, under
[19:20] $1,000. um I wasn't as good to catch it
[19:23] under $100 or under
[19:25] $10 um to start at least. But at least
[19:29] that idea of seeing the difference
[19:31] between an asset growing at way more
[19:34] than 50% combined annual growth rate
[19:36] you're like oh even if it's 25% 50% or
[19:40] more my purchasing power isn't getting
[19:43] decimated you know my cost of capital
[19:46] isn't getting decimated. So, ironically,
[19:49] I ended up raising money as a private
[19:52] company where you could use US dollars,
[19:55] Bitcoin, or Ethereum originally because
[19:58] I said I had people asking me, I said,
[20:00] "Hey, I've got Bitcoin or Ethereum. Can
[20:02] I invest, but I want to use that?" And
[20:04] that sort of compelled me to get very
[20:06] deep into, "Wait a minute, what what are
[20:08] these things? Why are they wanting to
[20:10] give them to me?" And then finally, we
[20:11] just said, "Sure, we'll take Bitcoin or
[20:14] Ethereum." very rapidly um I converted
[20:17] all the Ethereum into Bitcoin. But then
[20:20] 10 years as a private company, I had
[20:22] already had a bunch of Bitcoin on our
[20:23] balance sheet. So when we went public,
[20:26] um I literally had balance sheet Bitcoin
[20:29] before Sailor. Uh Sailor didn't come
[20:32] till later. He had a much bigger company
[20:35] though. And then when we went to do our
[20:37] registration statement to go public, I
[20:40] was the first company that ever went
[20:42] through the cryptocurrency and
[20:44] blockchain part of the Securities and
[20:45] Exchange Commission. So the way that
[20:47] process works, you submit your
[20:49] registration statement. The SEC reviews
[20:51] it, gives you responses, questions. You
[20:54] have to revise your registration
[20:56] statement. Well, ours, those usually
[20:58] take three or four months to do that.
[21:00] Ours took eight months. Eight months.
[21:03] Because the only thing worse than going
[21:05] through all of that with the Securities
[21:07] and Exchange Commission once is having
[21:10] to work with two groups in the
[21:12] Securities and Exchange Commission. The
[21:14] traditional group and now this brand new
[21:16] blockchain and cryptocurrency group.
[21:18] Through that process, we discovered they
[21:20] were asking us, well, how how should you
[21:22] cast this on your financials? And we're
[21:24] like, well, you're the Securities and
[21:26] Exchange Commission. You know, you're
[21:28] FASBY, like the financial accounting,
[21:31] you know, standards board. uh you you
[21:33] control GAP accounting for all public
[21:35] companies, everything on NASDAQ and the
[21:38] New York Stock Exchange, and you're
[21:39] asking us. So, we're having these
[21:42] debates with them, and they escalated it
[21:44] to what they call the chief accounting
[21:47] group or the chief accounting agency
[21:49] within the Securities and Exchange
[21:51] Commission. And we're having this open
[21:53] discussion about what do we do with
[21:56] Bitcoin on our balance sheet? And at the
[21:59] time, there were no rules. So they said,
[22:02] "What do you think?" And we're like, "I
[22:03] think it should be mark to market cuz
[22:04] there's a 24x7 365 market. Yes, it's
[22:07] highly volatile, but we should just
[22:09] market to market and whatever it is, it
[22:11] is. And there's a a public, you know,
[22:14] persona for that." Well, ultimately, we
[22:17] get everything approved. I think we were
[22:19] the first company in the history of Wall
[22:20] Street that got through the
[22:23] registrations process without any rules
[22:26] from the SEC, but which we selected to
[22:29] file our 10Ks, our 10 Q's, and we kept
[22:33] all the Bitcoin. And then once we got a
[22:35] registration statement, we used an ATM
[22:38] or an at the money registration
[22:40] statement to start raising cash to buy
[22:42] Bitcoin. Sound familiar?
[22:45] But we did, you know, all of that like
[22:48] we were kind of like GameStop or AMC
[22:51] before everybody learned about naked
[22:53] shorting and all these crazy games and
[22:55] the meme stocks. And then we were doing
[22:58] what ultimately Micro Strategy did, but
[23:01] we did it far earlier than them and
[23:03] there were no rules. So we suddenly got
[23:06] into this weird dynamic where finally
[23:08] the SEC did the most punitive thing it
[23:11] could do which affected us. it affected
[23:13] strategy uh and all the others. They
[23:16] said, "Okay, if you buy Bitcoin, let's
[23:18] say you bought it at $50,000 for easy
[23:20] math and it dropped to $25,000 and now
[23:24] it's trading at $85,000."
[23:27] Well, what they said is if you bought at
[23:29] 50, anytime the price drops, you have to
[23:33] take an earnings per share one-time loss
[23:37] for the amount of money below the
[23:39] $50,000 purchase price and you basically
[23:45] have to hold it that way. Now, if it
[23:46] went down to 25 or even 15 like it did
[23:49] and now it comes all the way back up,
[23:52] you can't take any gains.
[23:54] There's no unrealized gains, but you
[23:57] have to recognize the losses. So, it
[24:00] forced you to write down any Bitcoin you
[24:02] purchased at any price to the lowest
[24:04] possible value it ever traded at since
[24:07] you bought it. But you could never get
[24:10] the economic benefit for any reason
[24:13] until you sold it. So now that changed
[24:18] as of the start of this year, right?
[24:20] They said, "Okay, now we're going to
[24:21] market to market." So people were
[24:23] waiting, okay, sailor, when are you
[24:25] going to recalibrate your balance sheet
[24:27] and your P&L to reflect its current
[24:30] value? And they deferred that for quite
[24:32] a while because there was a window where
[24:34] it was optional. And so it was just so
[24:38] strange. Personally, I just kept buying
[24:40] Bitcoin and stacking it, right? And you
[24:42] learn to hodal and make sure your stack
[24:44] never gets smaller and you just keep
[24:46] building it up over time. But that was
[24:49] easy to do. Personally, that was really
[24:52] hard to do in a public company because
[24:55] the public company is governed by
[24:57] directors and then everybody's got to
[25:00] approve it and then your auditors have
[25:02] never seen this stuff before. So,
[25:04] they're terrified to go, well, you know,
[25:06] we're we're the big four. We can't mess
[25:09] up something because there's no rules.
[25:12] And that was just a fascinating process
[25:15] to arrive finally, you know, where now
[25:18] it's like, oh yeah, yeah, people are
[25:19] buying it for Treasury. Oh, GameStop's
[25:22] going to do it now. You know, all these
[25:23] companies are doing it. Metaplanet over
[25:26] in Japan is doing it. Everyone's
[25:28] suddenly doing it. Similar Scientific,
[25:30] but back when we were doing it, like we
[25:33] had more Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[25:34] when we were private as a company than
[25:37] we did it when we were public. But it
[25:39] was just fascinating to see the chaos,
[25:43] the sheer chaos of it. Um, but then you
[25:47] become an evangelist, right? Personally,
[25:49] you become an evangelist in corporate
[25:51] and then everyone's got to go through a
[25:53] process of either being hurt or or have
[25:57] something stolen or lost to realize, oh,
[26:00] there's Bitcoin and there's Shitcoin.
[26:02] there's scams and there's Bitcoin, you
[26:05] know, and all of that uh makes you
[26:07] become a Bitcoin maximalist. But I
[26:09] almost think, you know, every four years
[26:11] we have a new wave of of investors in
[26:13] crypto. And then they're taught, oh, you
[26:16] go to Coinbase and create some
[26:17] diversified portfolio of these digital
[26:19] assets, which is absolutely dumb. You
[26:22] should just say, I go there, I buy
[26:23] Bitcoin, I sell custody, you know,
[26:26] bingo, I'm done. That's such an
[26:29] interesting story. I never heard that. I
[26:31] always thought uh Micro Strategy
[26:33] basically was the first company that
[26:35] that took it public. So you were
[26:38] actually um with the company the first
[26:41] publicly traded company on on the NASDAQ
[26:43] that had Bitcoin on the balance sheet.
[26:45] You said you had less Bitcoin publicly.
[26:47] Did did you sell in in in the process of
[26:49] getting public? Uh so you know the whole
[26:53] process of when we went through it
[26:54] initially we were just maintaining the
[26:57] Bitcoin that were part of our private
[26:59] financings. So, in the last $50 million
[27:03] we raised uh privately, we ended up
[27:06] having probably the most Bitcoin during
[27:09] that raise. Now, there was lots of cash
[27:11] investors. We had a sovereign fund with
[27:13] like $20 million. We had corporations
[27:15] and venture capitalists and all that,
[27:17] but a lot of the angels were the ones
[27:19] that we would see or the big family
[27:21] offices were the ones that would have
[27:24] cryptocurrency. And so, if they gave us
[27:26] Ethereum, we would convert it. If they
[27:28] gave us Bitcoin, we would hold it. So,
[27:30] initially the process was just letting
[27:32] the Bitcoin sit on the balance sheet and
[27:35] holding it at the cost we received it
[27:37] at. We weren't even marking it up or
[27:39] down. When we went through at the SEC,
[27:42] we didn't realize what a circus it would
[27:44] become. And then when we started trading
[27:47] um you know it was funny along the way
[27:49] our our board um one year for our
[27:53] strategic plan I asked our chairman of
[27:56] the board who was an ex CFO of JP
[27:59] Morgan's investment bank I said all
[28:01] right you play the role of defending the
[28:04] US dollar for our strategic plan and I'm
[28:07] going to take the role of defending
[28:09] Bitcoin for our strategic plan and that
[28:12] process you know very unlike Sailor
[28:15] Sailor had a wonderful board that
[28:18] actually was fully in tune with I don't
[28:20] care about the volatility. You know, we
[28:22] have our company, we're profitable,
[28:25] we're going to use our cash, we're going
[28:26] to buy Bitcoin, and we're going to hold
[28:27] it, and we understand it's going to be
[28:29] volatile, but this is the right way that
[28:31] we're going to do it. Um, I had a board
[28:33] composed of people, none of which had
[28:36] ever bought any cryptocurrency. They had
[28:40] no Coinbase or Kraken account. They had
[28:42] never linked their bank account to
[28:45] Coinbase or anything like that. They had
[28:48] never used decentralized finance. They
[28:50] didn't know what unis swap and sushi
[28:52] swap were. They had no idea the
[28:54] difference between Bitcoin or anything
[28:56] else. They had never bought or custodied
[29:00] Bitcoin. So basically, I almost had to
[29:03] say, "Okay, we're going to get a $100
[29:04] little amount from every one of you and
[29:07] you have to do this." And they're like,
[29:10] "Oh, I'm busy." And then I'm like, you
[29:12] have to do this. So, we would have very
[29:15] contentious
[29:17] uh board engagements because I was the
[29:20] founding president and CEO dragging
[29:22] people to look at this stuff, to pay
[29:25] attention, to do the homework. And what
[29:28] you realize is that it's great if you
[29:29] can get a group of people uh where you
[29:33] know everyone is on board with the same
[29:36] ideology and they understand inflation
[29:39] and money and the history of
[29:43] collectibles and stores of value and
[29:45] mediums of exchange and units of account
[29:47] or measure. But what you realize is the
[29:51] fiat brilliant were Bitcoin
[29:56] stupid. And that's a hard thing for
[29:59] really bright people who sit on boards
[30:03] to believe that they're that juvenile
[30:06] about their mental understanding of
[30:09] something other than the Federal Reserve
[30:11] and the US dollar. Their view was the US
[30:14] dollar is the most conservative thing in
[30:16] the world. you know, like buying
[30:19] treasuries. And I was like, "Are you out
[30:21] of your mind?" I said, "What's the
[30:23] supply of dollars?" Um,
[30:27] uh, I don't know exactly what number of
[30:30] dollars are
[30:32] there. And maybe they could go, "Well, I
[30:34] could look at M2 money supply." And I'm
[30:37] like, "Okay." And you trust that the
[30:38] graph is accurate, that you know exactly
[30:42] as they're printing that money what the
[30:45] supply is. I said I will suggest to you
[30:48] that it's the world's assets divided by
[30:50] infinity which you can't solve that math
[30:53] problem versus you know the world's
[30:56] assets divided by 21 million and every
[30:59] 10 minutes I have an open candid
[31:01] transparent fully audited public record
[31:04] with a ledger that shows specifically
[31:07] how many bitcoin there are and we always
[31:10] know the math. So, so why do you think
[31:12] that you not knowing the math is more
[31:15] conservative than us knowing the math? I
[31:19] said, 'Wh has that been audited? It's
[31:21] like gold. When has gold been audited in
[31:23] the United
[31:25] States? Decades and decades and decades.
[31:28] No one even knows if it's there. Nobody
[31:30] knows if it's been
[31:31] rehypothecated, pledged out. Oh, but
[31:34] it's the hardest asset in the world.
[31:35] Well, no, that's Bitcoin, actually.
[31:39] So when you go through those mental
[31:42] conversations, it's brutal with a board
[31:45] and it's even more brutal when you go
[31:47] out to deal with Wall Street fund
[31:49] managers. I mean, we did enterprise
[31:51] software. We made beautiful things that
[31:53] were like applications on the phone and
[31:57] those apps had our software in it. That
[31:59] was a cloud business, so we'd licensed
[32:01] software. I did our road show and people
[32:03] said, "Allan, what's an app?" Imagine
[32:06] that. What's an app? And we're my CFO
[32:09] and I are looking at each other going,
[32:11] "Are you kidding me? You don't know what
[32:13] an app is?" Oh, okay. So, you're you're
[32:17] starting at that level and I'm like,
[32:18] "Wait, you managed 10
[32:20] billion?" I'm like, "Wait a minute.
[32:22] You're just making fun of me. Come on,
[32:24] pull out your phone." So, they'd pull
[32:26] out like a flip phone and I would just
[32:28] go, "Oh my god." Then other ones would
[32:30] pull out like an iPhone and you're like,
[32:32] "Okay, you see that little thing on
[32:33] there? That's an app. Do do you do your
[32:36] banking?" you know, do you do it for
[32:39] travel to get your boarding pass? Like,
[32:41] that's an app. And when you're realizing
[32:43] that these folks manage that much money
[32:46] and they don't have the foggiest idea,
[32:48] you know, enterprise software shouldn't
[32:50] be a hard category to understand. I
[32:52] mean, Adobe Out Your Way, SAP, the these
[32:56] aren't small companies, right? So,
[32:58] theoretically, they know that, but they
[33:00] don't. Then within that, they don't
[33:03] understand the verticals and the things.
[33:05] And then if you're trying to talk about
[33:08] treasury, you know, it's like their mind
[33:10] explodes because you're trying to tell
[33:12] them, "I'm being conservative. That's
[33:14] why I buy Bitcoin. I only put the
[33:17] corporate money and personal money into
[33:19] Bitcoin that I can't afford to lose."
[33:22] And they're like, "No, no, no. That it's
[33:23] it's the opposite." I'm like, "No, no,
[33:25] no. You're just wrong." So, um, you you
[33:28] get into these bizarre debates like look
[33:30] at the the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
[33:32] 86% of Americans believe we should not
[33:36] be buying Bitcoin or they know nothing
[33:38] about it. 14% understand that we should
[33:43] uh my goal, Sailor's goal, lots of your
[33:46] goal and all this work that we do to
[33:48] evangelize and help people understand is
[33:51] because we want that to be
[33:53] 86% want to buy the Bitcoin and maybe
[33:56] 14% don't. You know, and what you
[34:00] realize is, you know, whenever I have
[34:02] all these wealth managers pitch, you
[34:04] know, Rob, you go make a bunch of money,
[34:05] you sell a company, they're going to be
[34:07] like, hey, come meet with us. We want to
[34:09] help you manage your money. And uh what
[34:11] you should always do, and I tell
[34:13] everyone, walk in and say, "What percent
[34:15] of my portfolio should be in financial
[34:17] assets? What percent of my portfolio
[34:19] should be in physical assets? What
[34:22] percent of my portfolio should be in
[34:24] digital assets or virtual assets?" and
[34:27] they always never still to this day know
[34:30] what the last category is. So I said,
[34:32] "Okay, make this easier. Financial
[34:34] assets, physical assets, Bitcoin. What
[34:38] percent and why?" And often you would
[34:40] hear, "Oh, our firm's not allowed to buy
[34:44] Bitcoin. Our our firm's not allowed to
[34:47] cold storage Bitcoin. Our firm is not
[34:49] allowed to pitch you investment
[34:51] products. um our firm is not allowing
[34:54] anybody to buy the Bitcoin ETFs from
[34:57] Black Rockck or from others. And you're
[34:59] kind of like, wow. So, you manage money
[35:02] for a living and you've missed the best
[35:05] performing asset eight of the last 10
[35:07] years. How do you justify your fees to
[35:10] the people who you manage their
[35:12] money? You successfully kept them out of
[35:14] the best performing asset on Earth for
[35:16] basically a
[35:18] decade. Why? Why are you employed? like
[35:21] what value do you add? And uh that gets
[35:24] to be very bizarre to have those kind of
[35:26] conversations. Uh but when you really
[35:28] peel back the onion, you realize people
[35:31] don't understand anything about the
[35:33] history of
[35:34] money. You know, if you said, "Okay,
[35:36] where you had 5,000 years of gold, 100
[35:39] years of a failed fiat experiment on the
[35:41] US dollar, and now we're going to go to
[35:43] 5,000 years of Bitcoin." They would
[35:45] think you walked in with a gun and shot
[35:47] a kid in church. That's kind of how they
[35:49] equate that analogy, right? They they
[35:52] think it's crazy that you would speak
[35:54] that way. And then you say, "But but
[35:57] Bitcoin, you don't have to trust a
[35:59] politician. You don't have to trust a
[36:02] banker or a central banker." In fact,
[36:04] why do we even have central banks?
[36:06] Bitcoin could run the function of a
[36:09] global reserve currency like a central
[36:11] bank globally 247 365 with no holidays,
[36:16] no weekends, no trading hours. And it
[36:19] would work because code is law. We don't
[36:23] need to trust people. The code is the
[36:27] law. And it works because inherently
[36:30] nobody trusts each other. So you can
[36:32] verify that. And math is more powerful
[36:35] than your emotions and your feelings.
[36:38] And you who is closest to the money
[36:40] printer who wants to get rich by
[36:44] stealing from other people through
[36:46] income tax or through the debasement of
[36:49] our currency. Let's take a break for a
[36:51] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[36:54] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[36:57] watches. Those watches are the most
[37:00] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[37:02] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[37:05] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[37:08] completely new and amazing Genesis
[37:10] edition of their watch collections. You
[37:13] have the date of the first ever minded
[37:16] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[37:19] also the block height and which epoch we
[37:22] are currently in. I love the level of
[37:25] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[37:28] Make sure to check out those amazing
[37:30] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[37:33] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[37:36] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[37:38] really do hope that you don't have it on
[37:41] exchange. But if you do have it on
[37:42] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[37:44] deal with that. The first way is you put
[37:47] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[37:49] entry for you to get into the
[37:51] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[37:55] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[37:57] super simple and secure way. And if you
[38:00] check out the link in the description,
[38:02] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[38:05] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[38:08] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[38:11] partner in terms of how to get the most
[38:14] out of your sovereignty. They will
[38:17] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[38:20] that is perfect for your individual
[38:23] situation. They will show you how you
[38:25] can secure your own devices. Securing
[38:28] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[38:30] have to keep all your devices secure.
[38:32] One topic that is overlooked often is
[38:34] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[38:37] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[38:40] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[38:42] place already? And last but not least,
[38:44] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[38:47] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[38:49] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[38:54] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[38:57] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[39:00] will be for the first time ever speaking
[39:02] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[39:05] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[39:08] really looking forward to seeing all of
[39:10] you there. You can get your ticket in
[39:12] the link down in the description of
[39:14] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[39:17] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[39:20] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[39:22] there. That that was really good. Um and
[39:25] and with your background, it's also
[39:26] really interesting to see how you do how
[39:29] you look at the recent developments. I
[39:31] mean recent it's it's with black ETF.
[39:33] It's almost uh one and a half years ago
[39:35] now. Uh but there's also the fast
[39:38] ruling. there's like the the sub 121
[39:40] there. There's a lot of things going on
[39:44] um that allow institutional buyers to to
[39:47] buy uh more and and to to buy easier.
[39:51] And also there are way more examples now
[39:53] with with uh strategy with with G
[39:56] GameStop. I always wanted to say game
[39:58] start and game on or something like that
[40:00] and and there are just way more publicly
[40:02] traded company now that that set an
[40:04] example. How do you look at how fast
[40:07] this adoption wave from an institutional
[40:10] level could actually go now? Now now we
[40:12] have basically the legal frameworks in
[40:15] place and really great examples also.
[40:18] Yeah. So at a simple level um this is
[40:22] just back to the future kind of moments
[40:25] for me because I I'm going to be 56
[40:28] years old this year. So I've I've lived
[40:30] through wave after wave after wave of
[40:33] adoption. And in fact, my career when I
[40:35] got out of the military started right at
[40:38] the onset of the internet wave. So
[40:42] living through that wave and everyone
[40:43] thinks, "Oh my god, Bitcoin's at
[40:46] $85,000 and I've already missed out."
[40:49] And I'm like, honestly, we have not even
[40:51] scratched the surface of getting
[40:53] started. um the adoption wave of
[40:56] Bitcoin. It's the fastest growing
[40:59] adoption of any asset, of any
[41:02] technology, of any platform in history,
[41:05] which is crazy to say, faster than
[41:07] smartphone adoption, faster than
[41:10] internet adoption. And I'm talking about
[41:12] adoption being the number of total
[41:14] Bitcoin wallet addresses in the world.
[41:17] Much like you would say total number of
[41:19] internet users in the world, total
[41:21] number of smartphone users in the world,
[41:23] those kind of metrics. But this is like
[41:27] 1997,
[41:28] 1998 adoption turns if we were going to
[41:31] compare it to internet adoption. Well,
[41:33] what happened at the the end of the late
[41:35] 90s? If you were buying Amazon, Google,
[41:40] Apple, you know, Meta, all these things,
[41:42] Netflix, uh, and don't forget what was
[41:45] Netflix supposed to be? It was it was a
[41:47] DVD rental thing, not not a streaming
[41:50] thing, right? So, there's tech being
[41:53] done as you're going to end up to where
[41:56] we're at. But to me, we're barely
[41:59] getting started. sub$und00,000 Bitcoin
[42:01] is kind of like you starting out with
[42:04] the internet in the late 90s and then
[42:07] you get to enjoy the next two to three
[42:10] decades of up into the right growth. You
[42:13] know, you can invest in Bitcoin is like
[42:14] buying Apple or Amazon or Netflix or
[42:19] Meta or Google like when it was a very
[42:23] small market cap company under a hundred
[42:26] billion dollars. And what happened over
[42:28] that 20, 30 years? Now they're up in the
[42:31] trillion, two trillion, three trillion
[42:33] dollars. So Bitcoin might have 10xed,
[42:37] but it's like Sailor, look at strategy.
[42:40] You know, they were at a couple billion
[42:42] dollars of market cap. Now they kind of
[42:44] bounce around 60 to$80 billion of market
[42:47] cap. Um, it's very easy for me to see
[42:49] how they're going to go up 10x to 600 to
[42:52] 800 billion and then they're probably
[42:54] going to double or triple and they're
[42:56] going to get up into that multiple
[42:57] trillion dollar range. Now, uh, why and
[43:02] how does all this happen? It's
[43:03] interesting because, you know, I saw all
[43:06] this with a corporate thing. So, like
[43:08] strategy and Michael do a great job of
[43:10] getting corporations and governments to
[43:12] understand it and adopt it. Uh, but what
[43:15] about individuals? Like, so what I did
[43:17] is I took my own personal wealth
[43:19] management. I I manage like 30 accounts
[43:22] every day. I've got my kids, my mom, my
[43:26] friends, some colleagues, I've got
[43:29] LLC's, I've got funds that I manage, uh,
[43:33] where people have created capital
[43:34] accounts, they put their money in, and I
[43:36] invested on their behalf. Um, and and
[43:39] what did I do? I open sourced and
[43:41] publicly posted what I called my Bitcoin
[43:44] personal wealth flywheel for
[43:46] individuals. I said, "We already see a
[43:49] strategy of a flywheel for
[43:52] corporations. How do I do that as an
[43:54] individual?" So, I posted it. It's at my
[43:57] pin tweet uh which is at Allen Nit. And
[44:00] I said, "Hey, this has worked for me and
[44:02] I'm
[44:03] destroying every comparable benchmark by
[44:07] doing this model." And I've been very
[44:09] fortunate and blessed and started from
[44:11] zero and and made a good living. I've
[44:15] put my life on a Bitcoin standard. I'm
[44:17] remarried with seven children that are
[44:19] kind of from 19 to 26. They're all
[44:22] starting their careers and they're all
[44:24] on Bitcoin standards. It's it's
[44:26] absolutely fantastic. So, what what was
[44:29] that model? It's really simple. I always
[44:31] tell people who said, "Hey, I'm living
[44:33] paycheck to paycheck. I don't have any
[44:35] cash. I don't have any money." Whatever
[44:37] the issue is, I have literally tried to
[44:40] train my children since they were kids.
[44:43] And everyone I meet, they're probably
[44:45] sick of hearing from Allan about, look,
[44:48] you have to pay yourself first. If you
[44:50] have a child, they're 10 years old and
[44:52] they get a $100 gift from their grandma.
[44:55] Great. You should take that $100 and you
[44:58] should immediately take $10 or 10% out
[45:01] of that and say to the child, "Here's
[45:03] $90. I'm going to let you buy something.
[45:05] The other $10 we're going to send to
[45:07] your Schwab account and we're going to
[45:09] invest your $10 and we're going to get
[45:11] you used to living off 90% of your
[45:13] income. So, at a minimum, the worst case
[45:16] is 10% of your income will be invested
[45:19] into an account that you can control.
[45:22] And so, it starts there, but that's
[45:24] graduation gifts, birthday gifts, you
[45:28] know, grandparents pass away and leave a
[45:31] little bit of money to kids. you you
[45:34] whatever that looks like, that money is
[45:36] going to go into those accounts. So,
[45:37] what do I tell them then to do? I've
[45:40] trained them to say, "Okay, now that
[45:43] we're in 2025 and all of this noise of
[45:47] of assets and ETFs and things that
[45:50] didn't exist before now do, what do we
[45:53] do? That 10% goes in. Um 40% I basically
[45:59] work to get converted into cold storage
[46:02] Bitcoin.
[46:03] So, of all the money that goes in, you
[46:06] know, whether it's they link their
[46:07] account to Coinbase or Kraken. I I
[46:10] prefer Kraken over Coinbase, but that's
[46:11] just tomatoes tomatoes. But I teach them
[46:15] to basically take 40% to buy actual
[46:18] Bitcoin. The next 20% I teach them to
[46:21] buy the Black Rockck Bitcoin ETF, IBIT.
[46:26] I pick that specifically because it's
[46:28] the most liquid ETF in the world for
[46:30] Bitcoin. It has the most liquid options
[46:33] market in the world for Bitcoin and it
[46:36] also works in accounts where you're
[46:39] getting paid in fiat and you don't
[46:41] necessarily not everyone has the ability
[46:43] to go to Coinbase or Kraken and go
[46:45] through that process. So, or they may
[46:47] have a retirement account which they
[46:49] can't self-custody actual Bitcoin. So,
[46:52] it at least gets them an approximation.
[46:53] So, that's 20% of the portfolio. So,
[46:56] that basically means 60% is just pure
[46:58] Bitcoin. you know, with the first 40%
[47:01] being actual Bitcoin, the next 20%
[47:03] being, let's call it financial Bitcoin,
[47:06] the next 10% is actually Micro Strategy
[47:10] because that's levered Bitcoin and they
[47:12] now own almost 550,000 Bitcoin and
[47:15] growing. And that gives me the
[47:18] volatility and the price of Micro
[47:19] Strategy overlaid by the volatility and
[47:21] the price of Bitcoin. And I get exposure
[47:24] to the greatest corporate treasury uh
[47:27] management system that I've seen. So
[47:29] that 10%. The next 10%. Is a recent
[47:33] change. Now it goes into GameStop
[47:35] because I've seen what happened with
[47:38] strategy and I expect that the same will
[47:40] happen with GameStop. They are a
[47:42] profitable company with cash flow. They
[47:44] had cash on reserves. They raised more
[47:47] money and they have up to you know
[47:49] debtree and six billion plus to deploy
[47:52] on corporate strategy. So, if their
[47:55] treasury strategy is going to do what
[47:56] Michael Sailor and strategy did, that
[47:58] 10% looks fantastic. And I still believe
[48:01] that there's a ton of shorts and other
[48:04] things that were never closed out
[48:06] through synthetic shorts uh on the old
[48:09] meme stock thing and that, you know,
[48:12] Roaring Kitty and Ryan Cohen are going
[48:15] to do a great job. So, now we're at
[48:17] basically 80%, right? We had 40%
[48:20] physical Bitcoin, 20% financial Bitcoin.
[48:23] Uh, and then the next 20% is split
[48:25] equally between Micro Strategy and
[48:27] GameStop. Uh, so now what do you do with
[48:30] the last 80%. Well, what I did is I came
[48:33] up with four ETFs that pay dividends.
[48:36] Uh, one of them, YBTC, which is a
[48:39] YieldMax product, pays bitcoins every
[48:41] Friday. So, every single week on Friday,
[48:44] you get dividends. And guess what you
[48:46] can do with that cash? you can dollar
[48:48] cost average more IBIT or Micro Strategy
[48:51] or GameStop depending on if they've had
[48:53] some dips and that solves the problem of
[48:56] I have no cash to invest, you know, I
[48:59] have no money to redeploy. I can't buy
[49:01] the dip. I'm all out of dip, you know,
[49:03] I'm all out of money. Um, so 5% goes
[49:06] into
[49:07] YBTC. Another 5% goes into
[49:10] MSTY, the which gives you the volatility
[49:13] of Micro Strategy that pays monthly.
[49:15] Another 5% goes into
[49:18] YBIT, which is another monthly paying
[49:21] dividend. And the final is Maxi, Maxi,
[49:24] which also is a monthly paying dividend.
[49:26] So, what does that mean for me is that
[49:29] once every Friday, I'm going to have
[49:31] dividend payouts. And then on the other
[49:34] three weeks of the month, I'm also going
[49:36] to get superersized with an MSTY, a
[49:38] maxi, or a YBIT dividend. And what do I
[49:42] do with it again? go right back into
[49:44] IBIT. Uh or I can, you know, if there's
[49:47] a downdraft in GameStop or Micro
[49:49] Strategy, I can build more in that
[49:51] flywheel. Uh so that's the base of that
[49:54] 100% investment. But I also do some
[49:58] extra things to generate even more cash,
[50:00] which is now that I have an IBIT
[50:02] position or a Micro Strategy or a
[50:04] GameStop position, I can write covered
[50:06] calls or cash secured puts. And in both
[50:10] cases, so let's say Micro Strategy is
[50:12] trading at 300. Uh for this week, I
[50:15] could write cash secured puts at 250 and
[50:19] I could write covered calls at 350. And
[50:22] the real goal is to let Micro Strategy
[50:23] sort of bounce around because the
[50:26] expiration is only, you know, 2 three
[50:28] days in the future, like today because
[50:30] the last trading day of the week, the
[50:33] likelihood it's going to jump up 50 or
[50:35] down 50. It could happen, but it doesn't
[50:37] happen very frequently. uh on the
[50:40] covered calls they expire worthless. But
[50:42] what did I do? I got the option premium
[50:44] which gave me cash which I can go back
[50:46] and reinvest. On the cash secured puts I
[50:49] get premium which I can reinvest or hold
[50:51] for more cash secured puts the following
[50:54] week. And so what I found is it's this
[50:57] wonderful flywheel where you're getting
[50:59] the most pristine asset in the world
[51:01] that has this on average 50% combined
[51:04] annual growth rate. even if it drops to
[51:06] 45 or 40 or 35 or 30, great. But now
[51:09] I've got this wealth flywheel just
[51:11] spitting cash in the fiat world. Um, and
[51:14] it gives me a concentrated position. I
[51:18] think last year, you know, it was a
[51:19] tripledigit gain. I expect this year is
[51:22] going to be, you know, wonderful as
[51:25] we're getting real close to where
[51:27] Bitcoin on a trailing 100 day basis is
[51:29] going to start emulating the M2 money
[51:31] supply with a high correlation. Gold has
[51:33] already done its move. Bitcoin usually
[51:35] follows alongside that 100 day lag. So,
[51:39] I'm just smiling ear to ear because I
[51:41] know what's about to happen. And
[51:43] meanwhile, I'm non-stop. You know, right
[51:45] before we talked on this podcast, I was
[51:47] writing some options, collecting the
[51:49] cash, redeploying, and today, cuz it's a
[51:52] closed trading day tomorrow, YBTC paid
[51:54] out all its dividends. Uh, next Monday,
[51:58] uh, YBIT will pay out its dividends. So
[52:00] that last like 20%. Uh if you only want
[52:03] to pick two instead of four, I would say
[52:05] I would just pick YBTC and MSTY and just
[52:09] do 10 and 10. If you want more
[52:11] diversification or exposure to a little
[52:12] bit different things that that bet on
[52:14] the volatility uh of Bitcoin on one side
[52:17] and Micro Strategy on the other, you
[52:19] could use all four. Um but worst case,
[52:22] you'll get a single, you know, payment
[52:24] every single week and then once a month
[52:26] you get a really big, you know, MSTY
[52:28] payment. And again, I just trying to
[52:30] solve for how do you make this easy for
[52:33] individuals and how do we make more
[52:35] people get more wealthy and more
[52:37] protected because I don't see a lot of
[52:39] people getting a 25% plus annual raise.
[52:43] You know, their compensation right now
[52:44] is not typically going up 25%
[52:47] year-over-year to keep up with that
[52:49] nightmare of inflation that's getting
[52:51] printed away. Uh but Bitcoin becomes
[52:54] that solution. That's super interesting.
[52:57] There is there an argument to be made?
[53:01] Like for example, I have a not a
[53:04] different strategy. I've I've just like
[53:05] I'm just like 100% in Bitcoin. I I said
[53:08] like I I focus 100% on on on building
[53:11] this podcast, building uh this thing
[53:13] here and whatever comes on top of each
[53:16] month, I just put 100% self custody in
[53:18] Bitcoin. Very boring, very simple
[53:20] strategy. Like what is the strongest
[53:22] argument for someone that is already
[53:24] 100% in Bitcoin to say like okay maybe I
[53:28] should take 10% or 15% of my Bitcoin and
[53:32] actually do this financial engineering
[53:34] with MSDY and YBTC. Yeah. Yeah. So, I
[53:37] think the biggest reason why is that
[53:39] most people, so you're unique, right?
[53:41] Because you're doing your own podcast,
[53:43] your own content, uh, all the money that
[53:46] you're receiving in fiat, you can
[53:48] instantly convert to Bitcoin, you can
[53:50] self-custody it. Um, I I don't have any
[53:53] criticism of that at all. Um, the
[53:55] reality, like, so my wife is a dentist.
[53:58] She runs her own practice. um lawyers,
[54:02] you know, doctors, uh lots of people who
[54:04] are professionals, they're getting paid
[54:07] W2 payment, right? So, they're going to
[54:10] get paid in cash. They may have a
[54:12] mortgage of the house they live in. So,
[54:15] that's fiat, though, right? The the the
[54:17] value of the real estate isn't
[54:18] necessarily going up. It's the currency
[54:20] is collapsing. But the effect of that is
[54:23] the real estate at least it's a hard
[54:24] asset and it's going up very consistent
[54:27] with the rate of return of the stock
[54:29] market. Um but the the the big thing is
[54:32] that a lot of those places will have
[54:34] 401ks or you can contribute once a year
[54:37] into a traditional IRA depending on if
[54:40] you make over 150,000 or a Roth IRA if
[54:43] you're under 150,000. So the big benefit
[54:46] is so take my kids are great examples
[54:48] because they're like call it you know 19
[54:50] to 26 and five of the six out of the
[54:54] seven are really from 23 to 26. So think
[54:58] about it in those th those terms.
[55:00] They're getting paid in
[55:02] W2. Now many of those kids what's the
[55:05] first thing they do? Their W2 payroll
[55:07] doesn't go to a bank and get paid in
[55:09] fiat. It goes to Jack Mers and Strike
[55:12] and it instantly gets converted to
[55:14] Bitcoin and then they use a credit card
[55:18] to pay their bills and and or you know
[55:20] their expenses for during the month and
[55:22] then Jack Mer's built in you know the
[55:25] entire transactional history of okay you
[55:28] bought Bitcoin at this here's your bill
[55:31] pay feature within they're going to sell
[55:33] the minimum amount of Bitcoin you may
[55:35] have a loss or gain as long as the taxes
[55:38] are going to treat it like you know a
[55:39] commodity
[55:41] Maybe if Trump declares it's a currency,
[55:43] then all those taxes go away. But in the
[55:45] interim, it'll say, "Okay, you bought
[55:46] Bitcoin at this. It's up or down. That's
[55:48] a gain or a loss. It keeps the tax
[55:51] record records. Uh, that's good." Then
[55:53] they just pay their bills through it.
[55:55] And what they do is they try to build
[55:57] about a threemonth minimum, sixmonth
[56:00] maximum of Bitcoin at strike. Um because
[56:05] as time's passing and Bitcoin goes up in
[56:07] value, much like Jack, you know,
[56:08] experienced for himself, um his life
[56:11] gets cheaper. So then you're selling
[56:13] less and less Bitcoin to cover the
[56:15] expenses and you're stacking SATs and
[56:17] you're getting more and more of your
[56:18] Bitcoin stack. So what all my kids will
[56:21] do is say okay I need a minimum of three
[56:23] months to cover the float on my expenses
[56:26] a maximum of six months and then
[56:29] anything that's 6 months or above then
[56:31] it goes to
[56:32] self-custody and they just keep putting
[56:34] that away so you don't have the exchange
[56:36] risk but the process they use is that um
[56:40] now when they have 401ks like most
[56:42] people in the United States and a lot of
[56:44] places in the world if there's some kind
[56:45] of retirement that you have to buy into
[56:47] like traditional or Roth IAS is um you
[56:50] can't hold all Bitcoin to do that,
[56:52] right? So, first you're getting pre-tax
[56:55] dollars going into those. They max out
[56:57] at like 6,500 per year for younger uh
[57:01] little I think it's like 7,500 per year
[57:03] if you're older. Um but then the reason
[57:06] you want to have those IAS, a
[57:09] traditional IRA, you get to grow all the
[57:12] assets
[57:13] tax-free up until you withdraw them in
[57:17] retirement. a Roth IRA if you qualify
[57:19] and do that not only does it grow taxree
[57:22] but when you withdraw it it's taxree so
[57:25] that's a big big deal so what all the
[57:28] kids do and what I encourage everyone to
[57:31] do is help your kids max out their
[57:33] contributions every single year uh and
[57:36] then when they get older think about
[57:39] what I just said on all those dividends
[57:40] I'm not paying any income tax on any of
[57:42] the dividends all of the reinvestment in
[57:45] all of Micro Strategy or GameStop stock
[57:47] or Bitcoin through uh the IBIT, they're
[57:50] just plowing into that savings model
[57:52] that looks a lot like what you're doing,
[57:55] except in those retirement accounts,
[57:57] 401k, traditional, and Roth IRA, mostly
[58:01] you can't self-custody Bitcoin very
[58:03] easily, even if it's a self-directed
[58:04] IRA. And with 401ks, of course, your
[58:07] corporation will say, "Okay, we'll put
[58:09] in money, you put in money, uh here's
[58:12] your percent, and they're mutual funds.
[58:14] You have no option beyond mutual funds.
[58:16] Most all 401ks, they don't have Bitcoin
[58:19] as even an option. Really progressive
[58:22] ones might allow you to buy a Bitcoin
[58:23] ETF like I did. But the reason for
[58:27] having these other mechanisms is, you
[58:29] know, traditionally most people's lives
[58:32] will be fiat. They're paid in fiat.
[58:35] Their bonus is in fiat. Their
[58:37] commissions are in fiat. Your payouts
[58:39] from corporations are in fiat. Whether
[58:41] it's euros or dollars, doesn't really
[58:43] matter. Your retirement might be in
[58:46] fiat. Your home is in fiat. A lot of
[58:49] your collections of artwork is in fiat.
[58:52] Baseball cards would be fiat. Um, you
[58:56] know, gold and silver a little bit
[58:57] different. But the idea is that
[59:00] everything you're doing in life almost
[59:02] forces you to be in fiat just like being
[59:05] a student and tuition and whatever sort
[59:09] of grant money you're getting or
[59:10] whatever sort of scholarship money, it's
[59:12] all fiat again. So because fiat exists,
[59:16] I came up with this model so that
[59:19] anybody independent of not being able to
[59:21] do quite what you're doing. Whereas all
[59:24] I have is Bitcoin, everything I get paid
[59:26] instantly goes into Bitcoin. There's
[59:28] probably an operating assumption like
[59:30] you're single, right? It's different if
[59:32] you're married. Um if you're single or
[59:35] married, then there's with or without
[59:37] kids. You know, now there's a new
[59:40] company called Meanwhile, which is going
[59:42] to do
[59:43] Bitcoinbacked insurance policies. So,
[59:46] that's the other thing, like I I'm
[59:48] older, right? These things didn't exist.
[59:50] Me and my wife set up a life insurance
[59:52] policy so that if either of us die, you
[59:55] know, everyone's got enough money or if
[59:57] we both died on a plane, god forbid, the
[59:59] kids have enough money. So, but if you
[60:02] set up a could be a $100,000 policy or a
[60:05] $10 million policy of life insurance,
[60:08] well, if you die instantly, then okay,
[60:11] that 1 to 10,000 to $10 million might
[60:14] really be worth close to what the face
[60:16] value of that insurance policy is. But
[60:19] if this is like paid out in five or 10
[60:21] or 15 or 20 years when I finally pass
[60:24] away um or something like that, that
[60:28] money 5, 10, 20 years in the future is
[60:31] not still worth $100,000 to $10 million
[60:35] because now it has to account for the
[60:36] debasement of those insurance policies.
[60:40] So I think you go through stages where
[60:43] my model is set up whether it's a child
[60:46] uh whether it's you by yourself, you
[60:48] with your wife, your parents, kids, it's
[60:52] sort of managing everything that you
[60:53] have to think through. Um and then if
[60:56] you can be a little more pure about it
[60:58] because it's just you, that's
[61:01] understandable. But when you get
[61:04] married, something changes. When you
[61:06] have a child, something changes. When
[61:08] you have multiple children, something
[61:10] changes. In my case, you know, I was
[61:12] married for over two decades. Never
[61:14] thought I'd get divorced but did. Never
[61:16] thought I'd get remarried but did. Um,
[61:18] then you suddenly went from okay, four
[61:20] kids to seven kids and uh, you know,
[61:24] post divorce assets, but then you're
[61:26] recombining other assets. So you have
[61:29] all this stuff that gets into estate
[61:31] planning, medical directives, powers of
[61:34] attorney, efficient transfer of wealth,
[61:38] uh, god forbid someone passes away and
[61:41] all of that. So what I found is, you
[61:45] know, you have to teach the next
[61:48] generation because when you go to
[61:49] school, like I I have three degrees. I
[61:52] have a lot of experience. Uh, I have a a
[61:55] graduate degree from the best
[61:57] engineering school in the world for the
[61:59] last 20, 30 years in my field of
[62:01] industrial and systems engineering at
[62:02] Georgia Tech. I have an MBA from one of
[62:05] the best MBA programs in the world at UC
[62:07] Berkeley. Um, but despite all that, I
[62:10] can tell you through all those courses,
[62:11] nobody taught me about money. Nobody
[62:14] taught me about managing money. Nobody
[62:17] taught me about earning a great living
[62:18] and then how do you make sense of it
[62:21] afterwards? They don't teach you how to
[62:23] trade covered calls. They don't teach
[62:27] you how to trade cash secured puts. They
[62:30] don't teach you how to roll over your
[62:32] 401k every time you leave a company and
[62:34] make sure it's in either a traditional
[62:36] IRA or hopefully a Roth IRA if you
[62:39] qualify. All these things just aren't
[62:42] taught anywhere. So you basically even
[62:45] when you get a great education and then
[62:47] you get a great job now you still have
[62:49] to figure out all of this money stuff
[62:53] that most people say oh I just outsource
[62:55] that. Well I'm saying you can't then
[62:58] with my own kids I'm like hey I will
[63:01] help you tirelessly until my last dying
[63:05] breath but if I'm
[63:07] dead do you know how to do all this
[63:10] yourself? And so as a parent and and as
[63:14] a uh stepfather as well, I literally sit
[63:18] down. I'm on the phone over Christmas or
[63:21] the holidays. We're sitting at the
[63:23] computer. We're talking with the kids.
[63:26] Here's how much money you make. This is
[63:28] the way the world works. This is where
[63:31] you're going to deposit that money. So
[63:33] every kid that I have, we have maybe
[63:36] they started with a custodial account
[63:37] because they were young when they were
[63:39] five and seven and 10. Now, they have a
[63:41] brokerage account because they're 18 or
[63:43] older or the custodial account has
[63:46] expired. But then every one of them,
[63:48] they also have a traditional IRA and a
[63:49] Roth IRA. And then on top of that, now
[63:52] they're getting great jobs. You know,
[63:54] I've I've very blessed. My three
[63:56] stepids, uh, one's a nuclear engineer at
[63:59] Los Alamos, deals with weapons. Another
[64:01] one is graduating next month, and she's
[64:04] going to be a nuclear engineer for Duke
[64:05] Energy doing reactors. Um the the other
[64:09] twin is about to start medical school in
[64:12] you know July. Uh and that's on my
[64:15] wife's side and then on my side I've got
[64:17] four. One who's a student uh studying
[64:20] business and entrepreneurship and then
[64:22] the other three have already graduated
[64:24] and they did a lot of business and
[64:26] entrepreneurship like me. Um but in all
[64:29] those cases now they're suddenly
[64:31] realizing oh my god um now I've got to
[64:35] manage all this. Now they're getting
[64:37] income. They have 401ks. Sometimes they
[64:39] have matching. Sometimes they don't. Los
[64:41] Alamos is a government entity. Duke
[64:43] Energy is a publicly traded corporation.
[64:45] So you're getting those dynamics. Some
[64:47] match, some don't. Some don't even have
[64:49] equity. So all these decisions have to
[64:52] go in. And then as they start, you know,
[64:54] they're all single now, but as they
[64:56] start deciding, I'm going to get married
[64:58] now. They've got to manage that. Then
[64:59] they've got kids. Then they got to
[65:01] manage all of this. And so we spend an
[65:03] immense amount of time about, you know,
[65:07] think of how uh progressive it is for
[65:09] kids coming out of college getting a job
[65:11] and their W2 payroll goes to strike and
[65:14] then they're using a bill payment
[65:16] mechanism to stack SATs that they've
[65:18] been trained to take 10% off the top and
[65:21] they invest religiously. Honestly, if I
[65:25] could get everyone on the planet or
[65:26] everyone in America to do what I'm
[65:29] suggesting, they would all be
[65:31] unbelievably wealthy when they get to be
[65:34] 60, 70 years old. It's easy to become a
[65:37] millionaire, I think, if you religiously
[65:39] start when you're a child and you invest
[65:42] for your entire
[65:44] lifetime. It just sort of happens by
[65:46] default because math. And when you're
[65:49] using Bitcoin as the anchor, wow, it
[65:52] really, really happens
[65:54] faster. And so that's the excitement
[65:56] that I see is that people say, "Oh, this
[65:58] is for a professional." No, this can be
[66:01] for somebody who's working at a
[66:02] restaurant that is doing gig economy
[66:05] work for Uber or Lyft. Um, this can be
[66:08] for children. And once you ingrain all
[66:12] of this thinking in kids as they grow up
[66:15] through their productive years and on
[66:17] and they're passing it on, you get a
[66:20] generation of savers, which is really
[66:22] what Bitcoin is all about. And you get a
[66:24] generation that's being protected from
[66:26] the debasement of currency that we've
[66:28] learned through history from the Greeks
[66:30] and the Romans. And oops, you know,
[66:34] India and China standardize on silver,
[66:35] not gold back in the day. that cost him
[66:37] a century of progress. And I think
[66:40] everybody can do this. And while
[66:42] corporations are their own animal and
[66:44] governments are their own animal, I feel
[66:46] great that Michael Sailor and lots of
[66:48] people like him are evangelizing that
[66:50] for big institutions and big
[66:53] governments. Uh Max and Stacy with El
[66:55] Salvador, God bless them. They're doing
[66:57] amazing work. I think now there's a
[67:00] whole range of folks where you Robin and
[67:04] I Allan we can change the world and the
[67:08] thinking and we can program it into
[67:12] people as part of their daily lives just
[67:14] like eating well, working out, staying
[67:18] in shape. All those things are
[67:22] discipline and conscious
[67:25] choice as opposed to saying, "Let me not
[67:28] only spend the money I don't have, but
[67:31] let me finance going to Coachella and
[67:34] I'm going to somehow productize loans
[67:37] where I'm going to enjoy life now and
[67:40] pay later." You know, people have to
[67:42] understand you are a debt slave. The
[67:45] system is designed for you to be a
[67:47] hamster on a wheel financially for your
[67:50] entire life unless you want to get out
[67:52] of that trap because they're not going
[67:55] to teach you how to get out of that
[67:56] trap. Um, and in fact, the Rockefellers
[67:59] in the 50s and 60s spent $50 million a
[68:02] year training
[68:04] society that it was um offensive to
[68:08] women and repulsive uh to women because
[68:12] men were making money and you're not.
[68:15] The Rockefellers didn't give a damn
[68:17] about women being equal with men
[68:20] financially. They wanted more people to
[68:23] pay taxes, which they're one of the
[68:25] biggest beneficiaries of alongside the
[68:27] Rothschilds and others. And they laughed
[68:32] about manipulating society to think
[68:36] being married or a woman being a mom was
[68:39] somehow bad. That's the dumbest thing
[68:41] I've ever seen. But everyone was trained
[68:44] for an entire generation to believe that
[68:47] nonsense. and it'd be okay. They're now
[68:50] a woman who wants to be uh the bread
[68:52] winner and they're a doctor, a lawyer,
[68:54] an engineer, whatever, and the husband's
[68:57] going to be a stay-at-home dad. You
[68:58] know, it could work in that that
[69:00] direction. But this concept of family
[69:03] units being bad is disgusting. the
[69:06] concept that we're going to invest in
[69:08] nothing but hookup apps like Bumble and
[69:13] Tinder and Grinder and then we're going
[69:17] to act like pornography is a great
[69:20] ambitious novel thing and Only Fans is a
[69:24] core element that Robin if you fail in
[69:26] content you're a guy but damn you could
[69:28] just be an Only Fans creator. Um, and
[69:32] that that debauchery is part of the same
[69:36] perversion of money in a different way.
[69:39] It's trying to teach girls not to have
[69:42] any values or morals or ethics. Um, and
[69:46] the concept of like, hey, it's all
[69:48] socially acceptable to horror yourself
[69:50] out for money, either literally or
[69:53] figuratively. It's the same thing. Oh,
[69:55] what's your body count? These are
[69:57] disgusting concepts. I have five of my
[70:01] seven are girls, beautiful, smart,
[70:04] talented young women, you know, doctors
[70:07] and nuclear engineers and entrepreneurs
[70:08] and business people. And I want as a
[70:12] father to be proud of like, oh, you've
[70:15] got a big body count. Like, that's what
[70:16] you're shooting for in life. Like, no,
[70:20] no, that's not what it's about. So, it's
[70:22] about morals, ethics,
[70:25] values,
[70:26] integrity,
[70:28] faith. It's okay. We're in a week of,
[70:30] you know, tomorrow is Good Friday,
[70:33] Sunday is Easter. Um, it's fine to have
[70:37] faith. It's fine to care about religion.
[70:42] It's fine to have moral
[70:44] ethic, values, integrity, and purpose.
[70:49] Like, there's nothing wrong with that.
[70:51] Um, the portrayal to glamorize
[70:55] debauchery is done on purpose to
[70:58] distract from the complete perversion of
[71:02] cash and currency and the way the
[71:06] economics and finances of the world
[71:08] operate on purpose by design. Just like
[71:12] sports is a distraction, media and
[71:14] entertainment is a distraction. you
[71:16] know, we don't have Rome and we don't
[71:19] have the Colosseum and we don't have,
[71:21] you know, people being eaten by lions
[71:23] and getting killed in gladiator fights.
[71:27] We'll just call it golf or the NFL or,
[71:30] you know, something else. And and this
[71:32] is all by design. There's nothing
[71:34] accidental about perverting people and
[71:37] perverting currency. It's all part of
[71:40] the charade to keep you on this hamster
[71:43] wheel of debt.
[71:46] I couldn't agree more. I I loved every
[71:49] single sentence you said in the last
[71:51] like 10 15 minutes. I mean in the last
[71:53] one hour, but like especially in the
[71:54] last 10 15 minutes. I know my audience I
[71:57] think like 99% agree
[72:00] also. That's really really cool. Ju just
[72:02] from the on the one discussion before
[72:05] I'm even a little bit more extreme. Most
[72:08] of my income is already in Bitcoin,
[72:10] right? So like uh I I don't even have to
[72:12] convert it uh anymore. So I my my fiat
[72:15] income is also increasing but is is the
[72:19] the percentage of fiat versus bitcoin
[72:21] income is is actually shrinking over
[72:23] time which is amazing to see. And now I
[72:26] have postp production members that
[72:28] helped me push the podcast out. I pay
[72:31] them already in Bitcoin which is awesome
[72:33] to see like a line of cash flow that
[72:36] doesn't even touch fiat anymore but I'm
[72:38] a very special case. I get that. Yeah.
[72:41] But that's I mean but that's the way to
[72:42] to think about it and the way to do it.
[72:44] And once you standardize on it, you know
[72:46] what I the the the thing that's very
[72:48] different. So you're much younger. My
[72:50] kids are younger. Um when you when you
[72:52] watch people in their 40s, 50s, 60s,
[72:54] 70s, 80s, the mindset that has been
[72:58] ingrained over their entire lifetime is
[73:01] so different. Um, you know, I' I've had
[73:04] lots of people, you know, this year,
[73:07] last year, five years ago, and and
[73:09] beyond, and and they're like, I don't
[73:12] believe in any of it. I I don't believe
[73:14] Bitcoin at all. My wealth manager said
[73:16] it's bad. And I'm like, well, they're
[73:17] talking their book, right? They're
[73:18] they're trying to keep your money there.
[73:20] But I but I said, okay. I go, let's say
[73:23] I am an idiot. Like, I'm completely
[73:25] foolish. I am not articulate. I can't
[73:29] craft anything that would convince you
[73:31] why. Whether it's mathematical or
[73:33] scientific, whether it's historical,
[73:36] whether it's the bad nature of bankers
[73:38] and politicians, what whatever it is,
[73:40] let's say you think I'm completely
[73:42] wrong. I said, "All right, do this for
[73:45] me. Trust me enough to put 1% of your
[73:49] net worth of your 100% in Bitcoin." And
[73:53] then every single six-month window for
[73:55] the next 5 years, calculate the percent
[73:59] of your net worth that Bitcoin
[74:01] represents versus fiat. Because we'll
[74:05] know you started at 1%, it's real easy.
[74:07] 99% over here, 1% here. If this is
[74:11] becoming more than
[74:13] 1% a year, 2, 4, 8, 10 years, and it
[74:17] just keeps going up, maybe you're going
[74:19] to realize something inherently is
[74:21] broken. It's different.
[74:23] In actuality, that doesn't often change
[74:26] what happens with their lifetime because
[74:29] they're in the last 10, 20, 30 years of
[74:31] their life. So, it's a little bit
[74:33] different. But what I often see the
[74:36] change that happens is when they're
[74:38] dealing with their estate, suddenly
[74:41] somewhere along the line, they just
[74:43] suddenly, you know, like my mom, she
[74:46] buys Bitcoin.
[74:48] uh she suddenly starts worrying about
[74:51] the Bitcoin she's going to leave for
[74:52] grandkids or great
[74:55] grandkids. That mentality of of how I'm
[74:58] going to transfer that lifetime of value
[75:02] gets different. But it does require,
[75:05] much like I said, if you do coins
[75:07] versus
[75:08] Bitcoin, you you have to be tricked
[75:12] into sending money to the wrong place or
[75:16] losing it during a transfer or losing
[75:19] your keys or something weird to kind of
[75:23] get the concept of custody on one
[75:26] standpoint and the difference between
[75:28] everything goes to zero against Bitcoin
[75:30] and oh no, get rich quick, get rich
[75:33] quick. But that behavior of get-rich
[75:35] quick is because the currency has been
[75:37] perverted. And so when you want all of
[75:39] these physical assets and all this
[75:41] lifestyle, people are more willing to
[75:44] gamble because the currency is so
[75:46] perverted that they're desperate to
[75:49] figure out how to get off the hamster
[75:50] wheel and they think shitcoins could be
[75:53] the answer, which you and I both know
[75:55] are
[75:56] not. But it always takes something to
[75:58] kind of go through. And all of us old
[76:01] Bitcoin maximalists, you know, look
[76:03] smarter and smarter each cycle. But at
[76:05] the beginning of every cycle, we look
[76:07] like the old crusty dumbasses as always.
[76:10] And then suddenly as the cycle plays
[76:12] out, you look smart again and Bitcoin
[76:15] dominance goes up more. Um, you know, so
[76:18] that's kind of the basis of what gets
[76:20] funny. Uh, the only other thing is
[76:22] really like getting good at
[76:24] macroeconomics.
[76:26] You know there's three sovereign
[76:27] territories on earth that have their own
[76:30] rules and own jurisdictions that are
[76:34] unique. One is the Vatican inside Rome
[76:37] which is obviously not part of Italy but
[76:39] is there. There is the city of London
[76:42] which is a part of England and the UK uh
[76:45] but its own little world. And then
[76:47] there's Washington DC a part of America
[76:50] but not. And those three jurisdictions,
[76:53] you know, ultimately I think what
[76:54] everyone has to pay attention to is
[76:56] forget physical war. There is a raging
[76:59] financial war happening right now, a
[77:02] horrifically raging financial war. And
[77:05] it is on one side the Bank of England
[77:07] and the city of London
[77:10] uh and by default the EU and NATO and
[77:13] the United Nations and the World
[77:16] Economic Forum and the big globalist
[77:18] elite on one side and on the other side
[77:21] is uh Treasury Secretary Bessant plus
[77:25] the Trump administration
[77:27] um a little bit with the Fed but but to
[77:32] a much smaller extent that that war is
[77:36] raging. You know, right before Biden and
[77:39] Harris left, they tried to outsource the
[77:42] entire US Treasury market for market
[77:45] making to the Bank of England. That
[77:47] would have been death, financial death
[77:50] to the United States because the bid,
[77:53] the ask, the liquidity, everything about
[77:55] the treasury market, which was the
[77:57] United States's treasury market, would
[77:59] have been controlled by the city of
[78:01] London and the EU, sort of de facto
[78:04] through the Bank of England. And uh
[78:07] Bessant stopped that, thank God. Um but
[78:11] who is Bessant? Why does it matter? Is
[78:14] all this stuff really chaotic? Not one
[78:16] little bit. Bessant is one of the
[78:19] greatest global macro hedge fund
[78:22] managers to have ever existed in
[78:24] humanity. And he did out of London and
[78:27] the London desk for Dereken Miller and
[78:30] Zoros all of the foundational work to
[78:33] expose the British pound and to make a
[78:36] fortune shorting the British pound and
[78:38] breaking the currency.
[78:40] Now, why did Trump bring Besson on to be
[78:43] the Treasury Secretary in the United
[78:45] States? Uh, really a couple of reasons.
[78:49] One, he knew every attack vector to take
[78:53] down the British pound. And Trump wanted
[78:56] him to use his knowledge of attack
[78:59] vectors and hedge funds of how to take
[79:01] down a currency to defend the US dollar.
[79:04] And in parallel he said expose the
[79:07] attack vectors of everybody in China
[79:11] tied to the Chinese currency and the
[79:13] yuan and the R&B and you need to say how
[79:17] do we attack the currency in China in
[79:22] the same way that you did to the British
[79:23] pound with Zoros and Draen Miller. So
[79:26] when you watch this macro thing playing
[79:28] out, you know, first of all, Janet
[79:31] Yellen left the Biden administration and
[79:33] they left 10 trillion dollars of
[79:35] shortdated treasuries that had to be
[79:37] refinanced. So our debt goes up through
[79:41] 36 trillion. The interest on the debt is
[79:43] through hundred billion a month, which
[79:45] is 1.2 trillion annually. And now you
[79:48] have $10 trillion to refinance. And
[79:50] where are rates? The 10-year bond is
[79:54] uh-oh. You know, initially uh they
[79:57] started trying to impose the tariffs to
[79:59] crater the markets which worked. And
[80:02] initially when the markets were
[80:03] cratered, what happened? a flight to
[80:06] quality, sell equities, buy
[80:09] treasuries, all the rampant buying in
[80:11] treasuries spike the price of the
[80:14] treasuries which plummet the yield and
[80:17] suddenly without the Fed, the Rothschild
[80:20] family bank basically intervening. They
[80:23] didn't change interest rates at all, but
[80:25] suddenly interest rates were dropping
[80:27] from nearly five down into four and got
[80:29] down to like 3.85%.
[80:31] Well, that's pretty amazing if you can
[80:33] actually drive down interest rates
[80:35] because they need to finance and
[80:37] refinance 10 trillion. And so, you know
[80:40] the math. Every basis point, and for the
[80:43] audience, there's 100 basis points and
[80:45] 1%. But for every basis point that they
[80:49] can get rates to drop, that saves a
[80:51] billion dollars a
[80:53] year. That's a lot of money when you're
[80:56] dealing with up to 10 trillion and a
[80:59] $1.2 2 trillion interest. So that's
[81:02] really what you're seeing. Now what was
[81:04] the response when Trump put the tariffs
[81:06] out? That globalist machine they counter
[81:09] struck. They started doing the opposite.
[81:12] They started dumping treasuries to drive
[81:16] the price down to immediately reverse
[81:18] the bond yields up. So they went down to
[81:21] about 375 385 and now all of a sudden it
[81:25] jumped back to 4 and a.5%.
[81:27] So when you're seeing this whipssawing
[81:29] in the treasury market, which is one of
[81:31] the largest and most liquid in the
[81:32] world, it's kind of like the currency
[81:34] markets. When that's happening, this is
[81:37] Trump investment with his administration
[81:39] over here fighting literally to the
[81:42] financial death. the city of London, the
[81:44] Bank of England over here. And these two
[81:47] groups, you know, the the global cabal
[81:49] of bankers, they're dumping their
[81:50] equities to crater the market on purpose
[81:54] because they're trying to make Trump
[81:56] scream uncle and to take the tariffs
[81:58] off. And the tariffs are actually a good
[82:00] thing. In the United States, the tariffs
[82:02] are what we had before the Rothschild
[82:04] Federal Reserve showed up in the early
[82:07] 1900s.
[82:08] We were wealthy, you know, we were
[82:10] producing our products. And what did
[82:13] Trump do? He didn't do anything crazy.
[82:15] He said, "We're doing reciprocal
[82:16] tariffs. If you would like zero, great.
[82:19] Then you give us
[82:21] zero." You know, right now the way it
[82:23] works is if you're a bank in the United
[82:25] States, you're not allowed to be a bank
[82:27] in Canada. Canada just blocks 100%.
[82:30] You're not allowed to operate in Canada.
[82:32] But we let Canadian banks operate in the
[82:34] United States. That's insanity. Oh, we
[82:38] have all these social media platforms,
[82:40] you know, Meta or Netflix or take all
[82:42] your your favorite stuff now X, right?
[82:45] All these things. Well, you're just
[82:47] banned from
[82:48] China. Google doesn't get to exist in
[82:51] China. They have
[82:54] bu okay, how's that fair? So, you can
[82:58] come to our market, but we can't go to
[83:00] your market. So, this whole thing about
[83:02] tariffs is nonsense. What's really
[83:04] happened is the world has been using the
[83:07] United States as a piggy bank for more
[83:10] than five decades, really almost 10
[83:13] decades, going back to the creation of
[83:14] the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and the
[83:16] FBI simultaneously to enforce debt
[83:20] collection. That whole
[83:22] nightmare, we don't need any income
[83:24] taxes to pay anything in the United
[83:27] States. We can use tariffs. And the
[83:31] tariffs, if you want zero, give us zero.
[83:34] That's it. But if you're going to charge
[83:36] us 25%, we're charging you 25%. Oh,
[83:40] also, if you don't want tariffs at at
[83:42] 25%,
[83:43] uh, your other option is invest in
[83:47] America, create production in America,
[83:50] employ Americans, and you'll get 0% to
[83:52] sell our market as well. So, this big
[83:55] outrage is fake. The outrage is because
[83:59] if you're getting free money from around
[84:01] the world and you have for decades, why
[84:03] do you want it to go away? You You don't
[84:06] You love it. Wow. We're charging them
[84:09] 100% and they're charging us
[84:11] 5%. Those idiots. And And they say this
[84:14] out loud. They know it's stupid. If
[84:17] you're you're in Austria, right? You're
[84:18] over in Germany, your BMW. I have a BMW.
[84:22] Uh, but take BMW, Audi, Mercedes, you
[84:25] know, we we can't take our vehicles
[84:27] there. You know, Elon Musk can't take
[84:29] Teslas overseas, but everyone gets to
[84:32] come here. You know, try to take your
[84:34] car and go to Japan. You're not allowed
[84:37] to sell your car in Japan. Japan only
[84:39] allows, you know, Mitsubishi and Nissan
[84:42] and others and Honda. That's what you
[84:44] buy. Well, so I think it's great that
[84:48] they're doing what they're doing. The
[84:49] real target is actually China.
[84:52] But the reality is that everyone can
[84:55] have great deals and that's why you're
[84:58] now going to see probably a deal every
[85:00] couple of days with countries around the
[85:02] world. They're going to renegotiate all
[85:03] the trade. They're going to allow all
[85:05] the tariff money to flow in and then
[85:07] they're going to start telling the
[85:09] United States because I don't know if
[85:10] you know this being overseas. Uh you
[85:13] know I keep hoping for World War I to
[85:15] end. You know why? uh because then
[85:18] they'll take away income taxes because
[85:21] income taxes were going to end at the
[85:23] end of World War I. If only we could
[85:26] just end World War I, right? Um and also
[85:29] when they first came up with taxes, only
[85:31] 7% of the United States population was
[85:33] ever supposed to be
[85:35] taxed. And the amount they were supposed
[85:37] to be taxed was a sliver. You know how
[85:39] they used to fund war? They would have
[85:41] to do war bonds. And then you and I
[85:43] would either buy the bond and they had
[85:45] the money to then do the war. Or the
[85:48] American public said, "Yeah, we're not
[85:49] interested in war. No thanks. I'm not
[85:51] buying the bond." Uh, you don't have
[85:54] funding. Guess what? You can't have war.
[85:56] That's another great thing about
[85:57] Bitcoin.
[85:59] So I think people globally need to
[86:02] realize that the real battle is between
[86:05] the globalists and the nationalists.
[86:08] Which is why in Europe you see, oh the
[86:10] wrong person won in Romania. Let's run
[86:13] to the courts and overturn the election
[86:15] result. Oh, in Germany, oops, the wrong
[86:18] party is getting too popular. Let's ban
[86:21] them. In Brazil, oh, the wrong person's
[86:24] in charge. Let's ban them through the
[86:27] courts. And you're seeing this
[86:29] worldwide. And I think it's up to
[86:30] humanity to say
[86:32] enough. I don't beg you for my God-given
[86:35] rights. I don't beg you for my
[86:37] inalienable rights. I don't beg you for
[86:39] my bill of rights. And we're not here to
[86:42] be subservient to a bunch of slave
[86:46] masters globally. You know, there's $5
[86:48] trillion in the Sod family. There's $3
[86:50] trillion in the Rothschild family.
[86:52] There's $1 trillion in the Zoros family.
[86:55] I don't care. you're not our master.
[86:59] You're not our god. You're not going to
[87:01] stand here and tell us what to do. And
[87:03] so that that battle is really the
[87:07] difference. This mass immigration, you
[87:10] know, when you look at tariffs, there
[87:11] was a great thing done and I'll then
[87:13] stop on this little tirade of sorts. You
[87:16] know, there there was
[87:19] 10 billion dollars of tariffs that were
[87:21] added to China during Trump's first
[87:23] term.
[87:24] MIT did a study about the results of
[87:28] those tariffs, you know, because it was
[87:30] like 10%. 10% tariff. And what they
[87:34] found is that of the 10%
[87:37] 0.7% became the uptick in the actual
[87:40] prices in
[87:41] America 0.7 off of
[87:45] 10%. And why?
[87:47] because countries ended up paying the
[87:50] tariff and the corporations ended up
[87:53] paying the tariff and they didn't pass
[87:54] all that along. All that happens is when
[87:57] you're Nike or Apple or any of these big
[87:59] Fortune 500 companies, they're
[88:01] optimizing globally, which is why
[88:03] they're aligned with the globalists of
[88:06] source everything to maximize revenue,
[88:09] minimize expense, maximize profit and
[88:12] shareholder value, right? That's the
[88:14] game. Well, if you're Nike or Apple and
[88:17] now you're going to have to pay tariffs,
[88:19] what's it going to hurt? It's not going
[88:20] to hurt the Americans. We're not going
[88:22] to go suffer at the, you know, buying
[88:24] things. What's going to happen is that
[88:26] Apple and Nike are going to be less
[88:28] profitable. Their earnings per share is
[88:30] going to contract. Who cares? You know,
[88:33] as Bessant correctly says, the stock
[88:36] market is a MAG seven problem, not a
[88:40] MAGA problem.
[88:43] Wall Street has feasted. Now it's time
[88:45] for Main
[88:46] Street. None of this is accidental.
[88:50] They're going through tariffs first,
[88:53] taxation second, and third will be
[88:57] deregulation. And they say it out loud.
[88:59] They tell you, "Here's exactly what
[89:01] we're doing and why we're doing it." And
[89:04] all the outrage you see is not organic.
[89:08] It is fake. It is
[89:11] funded. It is literally people that are
[89:14] hired to protest. It is people that are
[89:18] hired to virtue signal. And I don't know
[89:21] if you saw the most funny development is
[89:23] 4chan. You know, the big conspiracy
[89:25] theory site was shut down over the last
[89:27] couple days. And they discovered through
[89:30] the hacking that uh it was basically a
[89:34] MSAD honeypot operation where the most
[89:38] posts in the history of 4chan come from
[89:40] Israel, you know. So you have to always
[89:42] laugh when you see the lack of uh
[89:44] arrests and convictions of Epstein
[89:48] clients, you know, Diddy clients. Uh,
[89:52] the greatest thing everyone in your
[89:54] audience if they've never read should be
[89:55] One Nation Under Blackmail. You know,
[89:58] not One Nation Under God, but One Nation
[89:59] Under Blackmail by Whitney Webb, who
[90:02] literally had to flee the country. Uh,
[90:06] it's amazing. She was able to publish
[90:07] with all the receipts and not get
[90:09] killed. But the whole two volume set is
[90:13] about the intersection of Wall Street
[90:15] banks and central
[90:17] banks, US politicians including
[90:20] Washington
[90:22] DC, organized
[90:24] crime and intelligence
[90:27] agencies. And once you sort of see it
[90:30] all, you can't unsee it. And the other
[90:33] great book I suggest people read is
[90:36] Confessions of an Economic Hitman by
[90:38] John Perkins, which will show you from
[90:41] an insider who was an economic hitman,
[90:44] how the US uses the unlimited credit
[90:48] facility at the Federal
[90:50] Reserve, which the only group in the
[90:52] world that has access to that unlimited
[90:54] credit facility is the World Bank. And
[90:56] the only group the World Bank gives it
[90:57] to is the International Monetary Fund.
[91:00] And then they give it to all non-G7
[91:02] countries to debt enslave them. And this
[91:05] is where Boule and El Salvador were very
[91:09] smart about regulating. Um, but the IMF
[91:12] loans is under the premise of, hey,
[91:14] we're going to rebuild your
[91:15] infrastructure. We're going to build
[91:16] energy grids. We're going to do all this
[91:18] great stuff. We're going to build ports.
[91:20] But it's really designed to give you too
[91:22] much debt so you can't repay it. And
[91:25] then we strip the natural resources, the
[91:29] gold, the rare earth elements, the oil,
[91:32] the gas, and everything else. And when
[91:34] they can't pay it back, we take their
[91:37] ports, we take the infrastructure, we
[91:39] take the assets, we actually force them
[91:42] to drop a military base in. They vote
[91:45] with us in certain initiatives
[91:47] politically and that is the methodology
[91:49] that's used. So once you kind of, you
[91:52] know, start with Liars Poker to
[91:54] understand wealth management, throw in
[91:57] one nation under blackmail to see how
[91:59] anything they can't get done legally,
[92:01] how it's done
[92:02] illegally. Then you throw in how you
[92:04] actually use economics and money to debt
[92:07] enslave the world through Confessions of
[92:09] an Economic Hitman. The only other book
[92:12] you need to survive in life is the
[92:13] Bitcoin Standard from Safety and Amos.
[92:16] and just read through the first seven
[92:18] chapters to get the history of money and
[92:19] currency and all these things of what
[92:21] was the the rise and fall of empire
[92:23] after empire. Uh and then you finally
[92:27] have this foundation with a Bitcoin
[92:29] standard. And hopefully I've provided at
[92:31] least some tactical practical steps to
[92:33] say my strategy is to be sovereign and
[92:36] free and off the debt hamster wheel. And
[92:39] I've given hopefully some tactics uh
[92:42] that are easily understandable. Whether
[92:45] you have, you know, $1,000 or $100,000
[92:48] or a million, doesn't matter. And then
[92:51] just stay religiously disciplined to it
[92:53] and good things happen.
[92:56] That is an amazing ending point also for
[92:59] the for the podcast. And it it was
[93:01] really an uh it was an honor to to speak
[93:03] with you. You brought some really great
[93:05] insights uh in today, I think. And uh I
[93:08] Hey, I have like a thousand more
[93:11] questions. Maybe we can do a second
[93:13] round in some time and go deeper on that
[93:16] if you have an interest. That's fun.
[93:18] Absolutely. I think this this episode
[93:20] will do very good. I I have a gut
[93:23] feeling about that. Um I have one
[93:26] question that I ask each and every one
[93:27] of my guests and the question is what
[93:30] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[93:32] Uh the thing besides Bitcoin, I think
[93:34] that you can uh learn from me is that
[93:39] anyone can make it and make it big in
[93:43] whatever big means to you. Um if you can
[93:46] make sure that you have strong morals
[93:48] and ethics and values and integrity and
[93:51] work ethic, uh literally anything is
[93:54] possible. I started from zero. My father
[93:58] and my mother never went to college.
[94:00] They were wonderful. They provided for
[94:03] us. They provided a great family unit.
[94:06] They gave us a base, a foundation. They
[94:10] gave us the ability to care uh about the
[94:14] American dream. Uh and they also held us
[94:17] to account and forced us to work for it.
[94:20] Uh and made us understand that nobody in
[94:22] life owes you anything. If you don't
[94:25] like your situation, go look in the
[94:28] mirror and you'll know the reason why.
[94:30] And anyone can choose to have fun or you
[94:34] can choose to study more or get up
[94:37] earlier to work out or to be a little
[94:39] more disciplined in what you eat. But
[94:42] all of these things are personal choices
[94:45] and motivation. But if you don't feel
[94:48] sorry for yourself, you don't go down
[94:51] this path of debauchery and degeneracy
[94:55] and all these other things. Uh what I
[94:57] love about Bitcoin which has to
[94:59] intersect with this but came much later,
[95:01] it gives you a sort of a beacon of hope
[95:04] and it gives you a foundation. Eat well,
[95:08] work out, love your family, um be based,
[95:12] live in reality, and then just work your
[95:15] butt off. Um so the one thing is that if
[95:18] I can do this, literally anyone can do
[95:21] it. You can choose to work hard and
[95:24] study hard to get good grades that can
[95:26] then open opportunities for you to then
[95:29] get an education which then you can do
[95:31] well to then have an opportunity to get
[95:34] more education to get careers. And if
[95:38] you focus on being very strong of
[95:42] written
[95:42] communication, verbal
[95:45] communication, and you're a student of
[95:47] history, you can arm yourself by just
[95:50] throwing yourself into stuff and
[95:52] learning. Um, but you have to do it for
[95:55] you. No one's going to do it for you.
[95:58] and I meet everyone in the world that
[96:00] wants the lifestyle probably that I now
[96:03] have and and others I know. Um, I can
[96:06] tell you with certainty,
[96:09] uh, people complaining about the
[96:10] situation they're in is typically
[96:13] because they're whining about the
[96:15] results they don't have for the work and
[96:18] the activity they didn't put in. There
[96:20] aren't free lunches. Do the work. The
[96:24] harder you work, I assure you, the more
[96:26] lucky you will get. Yeah, this this is
[96:28] the ultimate teaching of of Bitcoin, the
[96:32] responsibility and and and the same
[96:34] thing. I think a lot of people have a
[96:37] hard time grasping the concept of
[96:39] self-custody and and holding your own
[96:41] key because if you lose your key, if you
[96:43] lose your Bitcoin, the access to your
[96:45] Bitcoin, it's totally 100% on you. I
[96:47] feel with everyone that went through
[96:50] that, but it's totally on to them,
[96:52] right? Yeah. I know that's a whole
[96:54] separate dialogue people can have about
[96:57] that, but uh take that responsibility,
[96:59] learn how to do it. Um get the
[97:02] redundancy built in geographically. You
[97:04] know, I live in Austin. I I wouldn't
[97:06] dream of having anything tied to any
[97:08] Bitcoin I own anywhere close to myself.
[97:11] You have to have it in different states,
[97:13] different safes, different banks. uh you
[97:16] know I I make sure that um there's
[97:19] nothing anywhere where I'm at because I
[97:21] don't want any issues tied to myself, my
[97:24] family, my kids. Uh so you have to learn
[97:26] how to manage that as well. And as you,
[97:29] you know, grow in life and, you know,
[97:32] get married or have children, you
[97:34] suddenly have a whole series of issues
[97:36] of what happens if I get hit by a bus
[97:38] and then uh how do I make sure that I
[97:41] never have anything close to me?
[97:46] Really uh really really inspiring. Thank
[97:48] you so much. We have a small end routine
[97:50] in the podcast where the previous guest
[97:52] is asking a question for the next guest
[97:53] without knowing who the next guest
[97:55] actually is. And the previous previous
[97:58] guest asked you an interesting question
[98:00] has nothing to do with Bitcoin and you
[98:02] can take it in so many different ways.
[98:04] The question is at what point does life
[98:06] really start? Wow, that is a very loaded
[98:10] question. At what point does life start?
[98:13] So honestly, I think when I look back in
[98:16] my life, um, and you you owe a million
[98:19] things to a lot of people, whether it's
[98:21] your coaches, your teachers, your
[98:24] parents, and all the people that take
[98:26] care of you from when you're zero to
[98:30] somewhere where you're intellectually
[98:32] sort of grabbing and making a decision.
[98:35] Uh for me, the point of life that
[98:39] started for me was when I got in trouble
[98:44] in the sixth
[98:45] grade by being stupid and taking a a
[98:49] razor from a pencil sharpener out of the
[98:52] little plastic holder and I slashed the
[98:57] plastic covers on some library books
[99:01] uh while I was at school. No, no
[99:03] rational reason why I did this. Thought
[99:06] it would be funny, you know, all those
[99:08] kind of things. But life started when I
[99:11] got suspended from school for two weeks
[99:13] for doing that. Ironically, my mom was a
[99:16] an assistant helping at a junior high
[99:18] library, so it was even more kind of
[99:20] stupid. Um, but my life for me started
[99:25] when I
[99:26] realized not only how dumb it was, what
[99:29] I did and there was no reason to do it,
[99:34] but then when I came back from that two
[99:37] weeks of being
[99:39] suspended, I had everyone I knew almost
[99:42] was like challenging my own existence of
[99:46] what a dirt bag you are. you know,
[99:49] you're not who I thought you were.
[99:51] You're like, why would you damage
[99:53] something? You know, all these things.
[99:56] And instead of getting angry about that,
[99:59] I looked at myself in the mirror and
[100:01] said, I'm not that. I'm going to be a
[100:04] millionaire before I'm 30. I am going to
[100:07] show all these people that they're wrong
[100:09] about me.
[100:11] And from that day forward,
[100:14] um, I got straight A's through 7th
[100:17] through the 12th grade and the rest was
[100:20] history. And I realized that there were
[100:23] a lot of people through that that were a
[100:26] lot smarter than I ever could have
[100:28] dreamed of being. But I realized that
[100:30] um, I outwork anyone. And that was the
[100:36] the flip of a switch in my life of when
[100:39] life started. And then the rest of it,
[100:42] you get into having your first child,
[100:46] you know, separate from your own
[100:48] accomplishments. Like you having
[100:50] children or multiple children and seeing
[100:52] their
[100:53] accomplishments, enjoying being older,
[100:56] seeing what your parents did for you and
[100:58] appreciating. There's all that other
[100:59] stuff. Um, but everyone needs that one
[101:03] trigger that just changes everything for
[101:05] why they do what they do and who they
[101:08] become. Uh, and for me it was what could
[101:10] have taken me on a bad path and it
[101:13] reversed my whole life and then I got
[101:14] very focused from that point on. I love
[101:17] that answer a lot. Really cool. Thank
[101:20] you so much, Alan, for for for being on
[101:22] the show. Um, before we uh before I let
[101:25] you go, where can people find you, ask
[101:27] you questions and and and reach out to
[101:29] you? Sure. So on X, it's just Allan Nit.
[101:33] So A L KN T. I didn't realize, but
[101:37] apparently there's a few people who put
[101:39] up something close to that that used my
[101:42] profile and my picture. And so I've got
[101:44] a few fake ex people that aren't me. So
[101:47] mine is just a l kit t and uh anything
[101:52] else you see is is wrong. Uh that's
[101:55] probably the best place uh for people to
[101:57] uh find me and communicate with me and I
[102:00] try to keep up as best I can. Um and I
[102:03] guess if I uh had a question for your
[102:06] next guest,
[102:08] um we would like to say how do you
[102:12] handicap the odds that Bitcoin becomes
[102:16] the world's global reserve
[102:18] currency? And based on the percent of
[102:22] likelihood, if you think that's going to
[102:24] happen, what year does that happen in?
[102:28] Oh, that that's a that's a nice
[102:32] one. Um uh really cool. Thank you so
[102:36] much also for for for the question
[102:37] already for the next one. Um, thank you
[102:40] so much for taking the time and uh, as
[102:43] always, um, I put your, uh, link to the
[102:46] Twitter so so people can go directly to
[102:48] the real one, not to one of the
[102:50] imposters on Twitter there. So, thank
[102:53] you so much for your time and also thank
[102:54] you so much for everyone that is
[102:55] watching and listening for joining us
[102:57] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[102:59] with another episode. Bye-bye.
