[00:00] if you're going to DCA into a Bitcoin
[00:01] position why not generate more SATs
[00:03] doing it and look at mining price and
[00:05] hash rate is the twin Helix of bitcoin's
[00:08] DNA so you've got like one strand that's
[00:10] going this way and another strand that's
[00:12] that's in parallel they're interrelated
[00:14] but they're not exact one to one hash
[00:16] rate has sort of broken its fouryear
[00:18] cycle that's a precursor for bitcoin's
[00:21] Price cycle to break as well there's
[00:23] going to be a phase shift to where
[00:25] Humanity shifts across the Event Horizon
[00:27] and into Bitcoin as the primary story
[00:30] mining is the only thing you can do on
[00:32] the entire planet that you invest
[00:34] dollars to get into and you get Bitcoin
[00:38] as a return When miners make their
[00:40] biggest returns is when the hash rate
[00:42] cannot keep up with the price
[00:44] appreciation ever since China banned
[00:46] Bitcoin the chart has just been up and
[00:48] to the
[00:49] [Music]
[00:53] right why should someone mine Bitcoin in
[00:57] the first place there are a lot of
[00:58] different ways to to M Bitcoin but like
[01:01] why even go ahead and and mine Bitcoin
[01:04] well I think it depends on your frame of
[01:07] reference so there are two reasons that
[01:10] clients of ours choose to mind Bitcoin
[01:12] one is to stack SATs and the which is
[01:15] you know the way that Satoshi designed
[01:17] Bitcoin to be distributed on the Bitcoin
[01:19] Network the other reason is to to stack
[01:22] Fiat
[01:24] and when you look at those two choices
[01:28] like if you're going to stack Fiat or if
[01:29] you're going to stack Bitcoin you wind
[01:32] up with different analysis and that's
[01:34] that's been a point of confusion I think
[01:36] in our industry so for instance if
[01:38] you're mining Bitcoin to stack SATs and
[01:40] there's good reasons to do so and I I'll
[01:43] mention what a few of those are but if
[01:45] you're mining Bitcoin to stack SATs it's
[01:47] it's um it's not an Roi question and the
[01:52] reason why it's not an Roi question is
[01:54] because you want to know what did those
[01:56] SATs cost you to acquire as compared to
[01:58] what would it cost to acquire those same
[02:00] SATs on an exchange because that's the
[02:02] other way that you can acquire your STS
[02:04] right now the the the confusing part
[02:08] about that though is it's
[02:10] counterintuitive because mining is the
[02:12] only thing you can do on the entire
[02:15] planet that you invest dollars to get
[02:18] into and you get Bitcoin as a return so
[02:21] it's very natural for people to want to
[02:24] analyze Bitcoin mining from an Roi
[02:26] perspective because that's how you man
[02:28] analyze every other investment on the
[02:30] planet that you make but mining is a
[02:32] zero to one invention and you have to
[02:35] look at it as a Bitcoin or from an
[02:36] alternative perspective now there's a
[02:38] lot of people that choose not to look at
[02:40] it from a Bitcoin or perspective from a
[02:41] Fiat perspective look at it from passive
[02:43] income and for our particular business
[02:46] that's not the client type that we're
[02:48] trying to serve we're happy to but
[02:50] that's not where we're tailoring our
[02:51] target audience because we find that uh
[02:54] bitcoiners that are mining with us just
[02:55] tend to be better customers and
[02:57] understand things uh most of the passive
[02:59] income folks that are mining with us
[03:01] they wind up getting confused about hey
[03:03] why are my payouts going down you know
[03:06] why am I not getting them as frequently
[03:08] and it's well it's because the network
[03:09] difficulties increased what do you mean
[03:11] the network difficulties increased I
[03:12] thought you said it was going to be X
[03:14] dollar per month I was like no if you
[03:16] read all the disclaimers we're not
[03:17] promising any specific Revenue this is
[03:19] not rental income that you've got what
[03:21] we're promising is the opportunity to
[03:23] mine Bitcoin uh with your uh with your
[03:26] hardware and as difficulty goes up
[03:29] you're your rewards will go down what
[03:31] counteracts that is the dollar value of
[03:33] those rewards is increasing over time
[03:35] right so they become more valuable but
[03:38] you know over time we're drifting uh
[03:41] lower and lower in terms of how many
[03:43] SATs per terahash your mining rigs going
[03:45] to generate so as a bitcoiner just talk
[03:49] about the that perspective the primary
[03:52] reason why people are are mining um to
[03:55] to stack SATs is because it's cheaper
[03:57] than going to an exchange maybe not
[03:59] cheaper
[04:00] in a specific moment in time but
[04:02] generally it is cheaper so you're able
[04:04] to get more SATs for your dollar that's
[04:06] the primary reason the secondary reason
[04:08] is the SATs that you generate while
[04:10] mining are wild uh meaning that they are
[04:15] from uh the block reward uh directly and
[04:18] that means that there's no identifying
[04:21] information associated with those and
[04:23] what's really interesting is we've
[04:24] noticed a a unique phenomena with our
[04:27] clients which is a willingness to use
[04:29] the bit Bitcoin that they've mined
[04:31] rather than just sit on it and I my my
[04:33] sense is that's because when you
[04:35] purchase your Bitcoin on an exchange you
[04:38] have a sense that there's a surveillance
[04:40] camera sitting on your SATs and you got
[04:43] some like mental friction I was like hey
[04:46] maybe I won't just send these off to my
[04:48] buddy on the other side of the planet
[04:50] that needs a a few bucks right now maybe
[04:53] I'll uh I'll figure out how to wire him
[04:54] some money just in case I get tracked I
[04:56] don't know how to report it I don't know
[04:58] how to deal with it and I'm not saying
[05:00] don't don't do any of those things but
[05:03] when those streams are cut off the SATs
[05:05] that you generated then people just feel
[05:08] at Liberty you to use them it's
[05:10] interesting when I put the the Tweet out
[05:13] uh what people think about Bitcoin
[05:16] mining as a service because I I think I
[05:19] in El Sal it's the first time ever that
[05:22] I thought about Bitcoin mining as a
[05:23] service service when I saw you on stage
[05:26] uh and then I was researching a little
[05:28] bit I was like oh that's that's sounds
[05:30] interesting let's see what what Twitter
[05:31] thinks about it a lot of people were
[05:33] commenting oh it's just like way more
[05:35] efficient to to buy Bitcoin than just to
[05:37] mine it um and is is this like is there
[05:42] something to it is like when is it
[05:45] better to just buy Bitcoin or is there
[05:48] some some like those types of person
[05:50] should just buy Bitcoin on Exchange
[05:52] those should maybe look into the mining
[05:55] Bitcoin uh you probably have done a lot
[05:57] of calculations around around that topic
[06:00] already yeah I mean there's there's some
[06:02] really just simple heris STS that you
[06:04] can use but I think the the most
[06:06] important one is it's just back to it
[06:08] being a zero to one uh invention and a
[06:11] lot of people the same way that
[06:13] bitcoiners uh first started to look at
[06:15] Bitcoin and and when you start that
[06:17] process right you kind of have to have
[06:20] to break some of your priors you know
[06:21] you kind of have some ideas about what
[06:23] Bitcoin is what money is specifically
[06:25] and you go through a process that
[06:27] Bitcoin sort of humbles each of us and
[06:29] we realize like oh my God I was totally
[06:30] wrong about what money was and now that
[06:32] I understand what money is now I need to
[06:34] put my life savings into Bitcoin and do
[06:36] everything in my power to stack it right
[06:39] um and there's a similar process that
[06:41] goes on with mining where I think that
[06:43] people look at it and make some some
[06:46] false comparisons and then believing
[06:49] that they're accurate comparisons wind
[06:51] up making bad decisions so one of those
[06:54] is that I often hear is saying hey look
[06:57] I can get more SATs like let's just use
[06:59] some simple numbers with this cost about
[07:01] $5,000 for a mining rig uh to get
[07:04] deployed on our website right just
[07:06] simple numbers now you can say hey if I
[07:08] take that same $5,000 I go to an
[07:10] exchange and buy Bitcoin I'm GNA wind up
[07:12] with more Bitcoin that may very well be
[07:14] true and that sounds like an equivalent
[07:17] comparison but it's actually not because
[07:19] you're looking at your dollars being
[07:21] used for the exact same thing and when
[07:23] you buy a piece of mining Hardware
[07:25] that's not the same thing what you're
[07:27] actually purchasing is a piece of
[07:29] hardware
[07:30] that has three years you know on the low
[07:33] side three years of useful life what
[07:35] does that mean that means over the
[07:37] course of the next three years you're
[07:38] going to pay for electricity but you're
[07:40] going to spread out the cost of that
[07:42] Hardware to generate Bitcoin what does
[07:44] that sound a lot more like that sounds a
[07:46] lot more like a DCA product so the
[07:49] equivalent actually with $5,000 is to go
[07:53] set it on an exchange and dollar cost
[07:56] average every day for the next three
[07:58] years how many SATs do you get there
[08:00] versus how many SATs do you get by you
[08:02] know having your mining rig going for
[08:04] the next three years now that's an
[08:06] equivalent argument but the reason why
[08:09] people often compare those two things
[08:11] that are apples and oranges is because
[08:15] it is simpler uh to Simply put your
[08:18] Bitcoin on an exchange and plunge but
[08:20] for a lot of people that's a lot more
[08:23] risk especially newcomers to bitcoin
[08:26] $5,000 all at once if that's what they
[08:28] were going to uh put into a purchase can
[08:32] feel like quite an emotional roller
[08:34] coaster and so people have different
[08:35] risk profiles and so a lot of people
[08:38] feel more comfortable DCA and that's
[08:40] really our argument is hey if you're
[08:42] going to DCA into a Bitcoin position why
[08:45] not generate more SATs doing it and look
[08:47] at mining so generally speaking you wind
[08:50] up with more SATs as long as you're not
[08:52] in the Mania phase of the bull market
[08:54] and the reason why is because the
[08:56] hardware prices tend to jack up quite a
[08:59] bit during the Mania phase of the bull
[09:01] market so that tends to not be the best
[09:04] time to to start
[09:06] mining so a bare Market is a better time
[09:09] to invest in mining than than a bull
[09:12] market typically speaking
[09:15] yeah here's the thing when once you are
[09:19] see there's there's another sort of
[09:20] false equivalency that that's that's
[09:22] made often about mining which is that
[09:25] you're dealing with you know uh keyboard
[09:28] strokes and that's how you start Mining
[09:30] and it's not proof of work is where
[09:32] reality meets Bitcoin um and what I mean
[09:35] by that is if you say I want to buy a
[09:38] mining rig today for the most part
[09:41] unless people are mining on equipment
[09:43] right now that they're going to resell
[09:44] to You Secondhand equipment then you are
[09:47] going to have to wait some period of
[09:49] Time for That manufactured product to
[09:51] wind up in a data center to be deployed
[09:53] to start hashing to your wallet and that
[09:56] time span is often overlooked and the
[09:59] effort necessary to construct and build
[10:01] a data center is often overlooked
[10:03] because we're really used to in the
[10:05] world of of digital to things happen
[10:08] instantly and it just sort of breaks our
[10:11] minds that we actually have to deal with
[10:13] the physical reality of of Bitcoin
[10:15] mining and so that can confuse a lot of
[10:17] people so basically in the in the Mania
[10:19] phase of a bull market when energy is
[10:22] quite hard to come by and Hardware is
[10:24] going up in price it takes much longer
[10:26] for your equipment to get deployed so
[10:28] you buy a mining rig at the PE of the
[10:29] the the bull market it's the most
[10:31] expensive it takes a long time to get
[10:33] plugged in you're probably going to get
[10:34] plugged in during the bare Market at
[10:36] that point and then you're generating
[10:37] SATs that are extremely expensive
[10:39] because the price of the hardware was
[10:41] quite expensive when you made your
[10:43] purchase uh interesting and also the the
[10:46] thing where from from the time you buy
[10:48] and from the time you first start
[10:51] earning the Sates price could rise up
[10:54] 40% if you if you have to a wrong month
[10:58] exactly and that's why getting started
[11:00] in the bare Market is so important is
[11:02] because when miners make their biggest
[11:04] returns is when um the hash rate cannot
[11:08] keep up with the price appreciation so
[11:10] in essence I I think of actually price
[11:12] and hash rate as kind of the the twin
[11:15] Helix of bitcoin's DNA right so you've
[11:18] got like one strand that's going this
[11:20] way and another strand that's that's in
[11:21] parallel right like um like the DNA dual
[11:25] Helix and they're interrelated but
[11:28] they're not exact one one to ones you
[11:30] know uh so as bitcoin's price
[11:33] appreciates in order for the profit to
[11:36] stay the same for mining hash rate has
[11:39] to come online at an equivalent rate and
[11:42] that doesn't happen because reality just
[11:44] cannot keep Pace with the price
[11:46] appreciation during the bull market and
[11:48] so by being plugged in you in essence
[11:50] get to take advantage of that Gap that
[11:53] forms uh and your your margins get quite
[11:55] W wide so you know there were Tales of
[11:57] people that plugged in at the perfect
[11:59] time during the last cycle and they saw
[12:01] their Hardware paid for itself in two to
[12:03] three months uh in terms of just a
[12:06] dollar value um that also means though
[12:09] that from a a price of your SATs
[12:11] standpoint that you're getting a massive
[12:13] discount as compared to buying Bitcoin
[12:16] uh on exchanges at that point and we've
[12:18] seen you know for instance last I looked
[12:20] at the current cost to mind of Bitcoin
[12:23] um which we use Galaxy digitals model
[12:26] that they've published and it's kind of
[12:27] an open- sourced approach to calculating
[12:30] how much has it cost you know it's about
[12:32] $47,000 to um dollar cost average right
[12:35] now into a Bitcoin position using mining
[12:38] Hardware versus going to an exchange
[12:41] where it's what 96,000 today so you know
[12:44] that will change as more Hardware gets
[12:46] plugged in but that's the current the
[12:49] current status it's interesting the the
[12:53] um comparison between price and hash
[12:55] rate um I've seen in the last bare
[12:57] Market where the price went down but the
[13:01] hash would actually kept going up and
[13:03] hit new alltime high even when the price
[13:05] was like down 40 50% of of the the
[13:08] alltime high that was previous there um
[13:11] is is is the hash rate always following
[13:14] the price or like what what is what is
[13:16] the kind of the comparison you you throw
[13:19] there uh of hashr and the Bitcoin
[13:22] price man you're asking the trillion
[13:25] dollar question that nobody has an exact
[13:27] answer to right so here's here's here's
[13:29] one thing that I find shocking that that
[13:31] that more bitcoiners don't talk about
[13:34] which is that um up until this last
[13:38] cycle uh the hash rate has had its own
[13:41] cycle and it has been somewhat
[13:43] correlated to the the price action of
[13:47] Bitcoin now ever since China uh banned
[13:52] Bitcoin the chart has just been up and
[13:54] to the right I mean it's with very few
[13:56] pullbacks I mean there's there's been
[13:58] some some pullbacks but for the most
[14:00] part if you zoom out on a hash rate
[14:02] chart I mean it's phenomenal and so it
[14:05] seems that hash rate has sort of broken
[14:06] its fouryear cycle from my vantage point
[14:09] and I think personally we need data to
[14:13] prove it out but I think that that's a
[14:15] precursor for bitcoin's price um cycle
[14:19] to break as well um now whether that
[14:23] happens this cycle next cycle I don't
[14:25] know but you can certainly see with all
[14:27] the Sovereign Nation state adoption you
[14:29] know Michael sailor strategy that we're
[14:32] getting close nobody's wanted to really
[14:35] say that uh you know even prominent
[14:37] bitcoiners are hesitant to say like hey
[14:40] maybe this is the phase shift cycle
[14:42] maybe this is the super cycle I don't
[14:44] even want to say that either but you you
[14:46] look at it and you're like at a certain
[14:48] point it's like it's going to happen
[14:50] right and is Hash rate um breaking its
[14:53] cycle a
[14:55] precursor possibly um you know
[14:59] interesting I never thought about hashd
[15:01] that they have their own cycles and they
[15:02] broke that and it's it's an really
[15:05] interesting year um and I think a lot of
[15:08] people don't are very cautious about
[15:10] that super cycle word um as saor made it
[15:13] nicely because he didn't say super cycle
[15:16] but he said in madira we are about to
[15:18] end the 10year Bitcoin Gold Rush uh that
[15:22] that's basically the the super cycle
[15:23] idea but he didn't use the word super
[15:25] cycle for that and I think there are a
[15:27] lot of arguments we made that we
[15:29] actually entered that but in the past
[15:32] Cycles we all predicting a super cycled
[15:35] and then it didn't came it didn't came
[15:37] so I think uh we we're kind of cautious
[15:39] around that because we always fought it
[15:42] and it never was true but it will be
[15:45] true at some point I yeah it's going to
[15:47] be true at some point I think as all
[15:48] bitcoiners we agree on that right I I I
[15:52] actually I don't like the language super
[15:54] cycle though because I think it it can
[15:56] mean too many things to too many people
[15:58] uh I've been using the language of a
[16:00] phase shift cycle because I think at
[16:03] some point we will go from storing value
[16:06] in dollars which is the The prominent
[16:08] way or in treasuries actually to be more
[16:10] accurate uh but basically in the
[16:12] existing Financial system I believe
[16:14] there's going to be a phase shift to
[16:16] where Humanity shifts across the Event
[16:18] Horizon and into Bitcoin as the primary
[16:21] story of value and I think that that's a
[16:23] more meaningful language set to use
[16:25] because there at that point the the
[16:27] exchange rate to the dollar isn't
[16:29] actually going to make as much sense
[16:31] anymore because you will then be caring
[16:33] more about hey uh what's the purchasing
[16:35] power of my Bitcoin and so it'll be
[16:38] we'll flip the lens around you know how
[16:40] many eggs can I get for my Bitcoin how
[16:42] many houses can I get for my Bitcoin you
[16:44] know that'll be more the language said I
[16:46] think when we when we hit that phase
[16:47] shift um but I I think all of us can can
[16:51] feel that at some point like in the Noto
[16:54] distant future like money is just
[16:55] starting to feel funny it's starting to
[16:57] feel Monopoly like you know and there's
[17:00] something starting to seem and feel more
[17:02] tangible about Bitcoin and I think
[17:04] bitcoiners are probably the only folks
[17:06] that that really have that sense at this
[17:08] point but when the phase shift happens
[17:11] is when I believe most of humanity is
[17:13] GNA gonna kind of come into that camp
[17:16] and be like oh no this is actually more
[17:18] solid uh not not this funny Monopoly
[17:20] money I'm
[17:22] using yeah it's it's once you get into
[17:24] Bitcoin uh and you actually understand
[17:27] Bitcoin and you you you probably need
[17:29] like a year or maybe two years to to
[17:31] really get in there and get in this
[17:32] Bitcoin mindset um you feel really funny
[17:35] when you use that fat uh monetary system
[17:39] I just yesterday I received something I
[17:42] never received before I received a
[17:44] physical check uh from my old landlord
[17:48] in Munich because there was some money
[17:50] left over uh they got some some bonus or
[17:52] something like that so there was like
[17:53] $40 left over uh and he has my I and he
[17:57] could send me just like his money on on
[17:59] bank but he's I think he's 80 years old
[18:01] so he's from the older generation and he
[18:04] sent me this physical check where it
[18:06] just like written like
[18:08] $40 and you can then use that check at
[18:11] the bank and get money for that and that
[18:13] was like oh yeah that someone just
[18:15] written something on a piece of paper
[18:17] and then I get another piece of paper
[18:19] out like that that's just it looks like
[18:22] U uh we we are playing a game here that
[18:25] there's no reality in this fat game just
[18:29] receiving paper and and exchanging paper
[18:31] for paper that does not make sense at
[18:33] all for
[18:34] me yeah it's such a different reality uh
[18:38] my my dad last I was in at home there
[18:41] was some Financial exchange that we
[18:44] needed to do and he cut me a check
[18:45] because that's what he's used to and you
[18:47] know I mean the guy turned 70 this year
[18:49] right so no no problem Dad I'll I'll
[18:51] figure it out you know but it's the same
[18:53] idea it's like if you look at it it's
[18:55] like there's basically these like
[18:56] archaic little symbols across the bottom
[18:58] that are like the routing numbers that
[19:01] you know if you compare that a lot of
[19:03] people get scared about like a Bitcoin
[19:04] address for instance and it's like well
[19:07] you didn't really care about all that
[19:08] like robotic looking characters that
[19:11] were on the bottom of checks like why
[19:13] are we gon to get so scared about these
[19:15] uh these strings of characters that we
[19:17] call a Bitcoin address yeah absolutely I
[19:20] think we we we just need more time to
[19:22] build out the the fancy apps the the
[19:25] fancy Hardware like there are already a
[19:28] lot of fancy things out there in Bitcoin
[19:30] I'm surprised how easy it is compared to
[19:32] like 5 years or even 10 years ago uh how
[19:35] how easy it is now to mine Bitcoin how
[19:37] easy it is now to uh buy Bitcoin and
[19:40] exchange or something like that so it
[19:42] really got easy but we have a long way
[19:44] to go to make it super easy like so so
[19:48] clear where you can just exchange
[19:50] Bitcoin in your messaging app I mean
[19:53] it's possible nostr and we have those
[19:55] apps but almost nobody uses them outside
[19:58] of the Bitcoin a crowd so we still have
[20:00] a lot a long way uh to go there also
[20:04] interesting because we talked about that
[20:06] before I think that year 2024 isn't
[20:09] really special one because so many
[20:11] Milestone happen with like the president
[20:14] with the Bitcoin ETF with the with the
[20:17] Haring also what do you make out of 2024
[20:20] as we are kind of close to the end so I
[20:23] think 2024 proved to me that the the
[20:26] human species is horrible at deal with
[20:29] exponentials um the reason I say that is
[20:32] because I adopted Bitcoin in 2015 and I
[20:34] was particularly slow you said it took a
[20:37] normal person a year or two it took me
[20:39] like a good fouryear cycle before I
[20:40] really started to get my head wrapped
[20:42] around Bitcoin um and I mean in a
[20:46] meaningful way and pulled me out of like
[20:48] the the land of coinery right to
[20:50] was like oh no I I get money now and why
[20:53] Bitcoin has has meaning and purpose
[20:55] Beyond like this uh speculative fever uh
[20:59] that I'm I've been in and you know what
[21:03] I could not ever fathom you know I read
[21:05] the early Cipher Punk things I read a
[21:08] book that was all of satoshi's writings
[21:10] that had ever been published and what I
[21:12] couldn't fathom at that point even
[21:14] though like the early Cipher punks how
[21:16] fny were talking about like what the
[21:18] potential this could be is like those
[21:21] things actually occurring right um you
[21:24] know never thought that like within like
[21:26] the next eight or 10 years we'd see the
[21:28] US president uh start talking about
[21:31] Bitcoin or Bitcoin is a strategic
[21:33] Reserve like even the ETF process was
[21:36] like you know it' been kicked around for
[21:39] 10 years I think the winkl viite twins
[21:41] had had applied for an ETF like 2013 or
[21:44] something had been rejected it just
[21:46] seemed like it was going to be
[21:47] inevitably rejected forever there'd be
[21:49] excuses the existing system would come
[21:51] up with and so when you see these things
[21:53] like turn over was like well I guess
[21:55] maybe well I guess maybe like oh my gosh
[21:58] like here's this guy that like you know
[22:00] sailor that is adopting it at an
[22:02] unbelievable rate like I guess maybe
[22:04] we're going to see institutions come in
[22:06] but it's not until you actually see it
[22:08] happen that you're like oh yeah okay
[22:12] like this is what exponential adoption
[22:13] looks like so definitely is is faster uh
[22:18] than I could have ever guessed you know
[22:20] if I were to if I were to put myself
[22:22] back in 2015 when I when I first
[22:25] acquired uh
[22:26] Bitcoin I I would have guessed maybe
[22:29] 2030 to 2040 sort of time frame that
[22:32] we'd be where we are today in 2024
[22:34] absolutely the same am my side when I
[22:37] came into 2020 I I I didn't thought
[22:40] about a Salvador being a country in
[22:42] Bitcoin uh the president talking about
[22:44] that that's just it feels a little bit
[22:46] unreal to be honest sometimes I feel
[22:48] like are things moving too fast are we
[22:52] are we entering like a that that uh P
[22:54] leis talking about that suddenly phase
[22:57] all of the sudden
[22:59] um that that could be yeah really really
[23:01] interesting but coming back to the to
[23:03] the mining uh topic um you with SAS
[23:07] mining offer like a Bitcoin mining as a
[23:11] service service um what is that and and
[23:14] what benefit does that uh give
[23:17] people well I I I like to explain it
[23:21] with a little bit of a a metaphor which
[23:23] is hey um when was the last time you
[23:26] stepped into the street and flagged down
[23:28] attack
[23:29] what when was like like if you if if you
[23:34] need to get a ride to the airport from
[23:35] wherever you live you're going to open
[23:37] up the Uber The Lift app and a taxi is
[23:39] going to show up at your doorstep right
[23:42] and in essence that's been the approach
[23:44] that we took like that's that's a a ride
[23:47] share as a service sort of approach
[23:49] right where taxis um were the norm if
[23:52] you had a buddy that was a taxi driver
[23:54] you could give him a call if he was
[23:55] awake maybe he'd come get you maybe you
[23:57] stood in the street and New York City
[23:59] and and tried to hail a cab but you know
[24:01] it was a very inconvenient experience
[24:03] before and to me that's that's the
[24:05] difference between hosted Bitcoin mining
[24:07] and and Mining as a service and what we
[24:10] aimed to create was a simple user
[24:13] interface and experience that put all
[24:16] the complexity of mining into the
[24:18] background and left users with a simple
[24:20] set of decisions so what I mean is you
[24:23] know we've got an e-commerce store we've
[24:25] got just a couple of different mining
[24:27] rigs aail ailable per purchase so it's a
[24:29] curated list of hey this is a specific
[24:33] hydr cooled Miner that gives you uh the
[24:36] ability to recover heat using it we've
[24:38] got another mining rig that is the most
[24:41] efficient uh for air cooled and then
[24:44] we've got another one that's slightly
[24:45] below that a better price point so if
[24:47] you're value conscious or Price
[24:49] conscious like that that'd be the one
[24:50] for you so kind of instead of having
[24:53] like all makes some models and forcing
[24:55] users to decide it's like no here here
[24:57] let's make it easy for you here's three
[24:59] options they're distinct you make a
[25:01] choice between these three and then once
[25:03] it's purchased we get it procured we get
[25:05] it deployed in the into the the data
[25:08] center and then we've got a simple and
[25:10] easily understood uh dashboard right so
[25:13] you can actually have like here's your
[25:15] your user settings here's the settings
[25:17] of your mining rig here's uh your TFA
[25:22] here's your uh your contact information
[25:25] whatever you want to share with us for a
[25:27] name phone number that sort of thing and
[25:29] then here's your Bitcoin address where
[25:31] the rewards are going to go right um and
[25:34] then you can see the payouts you can
[25:36] track them on the blockchain uh you can
[25:38] see your service fees meaning your
[25:40] electricity and maintenance how much
[25:43] those cost you've got your invoices
[25:44] available like all the things that you
[25:46] would want in one single place in
[25:48] interface whereas right now the
[25:50] ecosystem if you're trying to host with
[25:53] somebody you know you've got maybe the
[25:55] party that you're working with and then
[25:57] you've got a mining pool to that you
[25:59] need to go log into and then you've got
[26:01] you know maybe a third party monitoring
[26:03] solution and you've got a VPN into your
[26:06] mining rig and and get it coordinated
[26:08] and pointed to the pool of your choice
[26:10] and all these things that create a lot
[26:12] of friction for for people to adopt it
[26:14] just taking all of that and hiding it in
[26:16] the background uh through the use of of
[26:19] innovative design and and user
[26:22] experience uh and user
[26:25] interfaces it's really interesting
[26:28] because in the back of my mind is like
[26:30] there's like the fire Community
[26:31] retirement community passive income
[26:33] community and the Bitcoin community and
[26:36] for all them could be Bitcoin mining
[26:38] especially as a service be really
[26:40] interesting like there's like if you
[26:42] just want to know learn about Bitcoin
[26:45] mining probably like a bid a like solo
[26:47] Miner is probably the the the the best
[26:49] way to goach us to to to learn it uh but
[26:52] if you actually want to invest in
[26:55] Bitcoin mining uh uh Bitcoin mining as a
[26:58] service seems to be super interesting uh
[27:02] say coming from a guy that has uh very
[27:06] very little clue about Bitcoin mining in
[27:08] itself uh that's why I also want to
[27:11] start next year to get a little bit more
[27:13] into the space just from a knowledge
[27:14] perspective I will try different things
[27:16] we'll compare it maybe make some podcast
[27:18] episodes around that uh but in general
[27:21] Bitcoin mining seems to be a really
[27:23] interesting um passive income maybe
[27:27] Bitcoin as Retirement thing where uh you
[27:30] invest some portion of of your money and
[27:34] uh I know it's not secured income
[27:36] because the free market and reality is
[27:39] at play at Bitcoin mining uh but you
[27:42] have a good chance of getting maybe a
[27:44] retirement uh income from Bitcoin mining
[27:47] is that also something that that you see
[27:49] with your clients or is there something
[27:50] that uh you even looking at uh for for
[27:53] SAS
[27:54] mining well I think I don't see it as a
[27:57] as a useful tool from a passive income
[28:02] standpoint because of the variability
[28:04] like if you're somebody that has a fixed
[28:06] Budget on a monthly basis and you are
[28:10] dependent on the income for Bitcoin
[28:12] mining to to service your needs and
[28:14] you're in your later years in life like
[28:16] I think there's a lot of risk there from
[28:18] a Bitcoin mining perspective however if
[28:21] you're somebody that is looking to stack
[28:23] Bitcoin because you know in the next 48
[28:26] years that the capital that you can
[28:28] afford your disposable income as long as
[28:30] you're continuing to cycle that into a
[28:32] Bitcoin position that it's going to um
[28:35] create the economic opportunity for you
[28:38] to retire early then I think Bitcoin
[28:40] mining is a wonderful opportunity for
[28:42] that because it's a DCA product right
[28:44] you're cycling your your Fiat just like
[28:47] you would go into an exchange to DCA
[28:48] you're cycling your Fiat through
[28:50] hardware and electricity uh to stack
[28:53] SATs and those Stacks are outside the
[28:56] system completely um also which is the
[29:00] the secondary benefit but I do see uh to
[29:03] your point that we have a lot of the
[29:05] service industry folks that are finding
[29:07] us like we've got cops firefighters um
[29:11] nurses uh who else do we have we have
[29:14] real estate folks that are doing this um
[29:18] you know we've got a wide ranging uh
[29:20] group of of folks but um the reasons
[29:23] tend to be split pretty evenly between
[29:25] stacking Fiat and stacking Bitcoin but
[29:28] we find that the clients that are
[29:29] focused on stacking Bitcoin tend to be a
[29:32] bit more realistic about the outcome so
[29:34] we try to focus on growing that side of
[29:36] our community I partnered up with coin
[29:40] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[29:43] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:45] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[29:48] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[29:51] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[29:54] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[29:57] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:00] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[30:03] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:06] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:09] watch collections you have the date of
[30:12] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:15] there and of course also the block
[30:17] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:21] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:23] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[30:26] check out those amazing coins Vil the
[30:28] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[30:31] love those watches so so much if you
[30:34] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[30:37] regular basis I'll guess you already
[30:39] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[30:41] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[30:45] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[30:47] personal recommendation for Hardware
[30:49] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[30:51] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[30:54] gift for a friend who has still their
[30:56] Bitcoin on an exchange change and you
[30:58] can get a 5% discount with the code
[31:01] Robin at the checkout visit bitbox do
[31:05] Swiss Robin to get your bitbox and the
[31:08] next step is to really level up your
[31:11] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:13] have the most secure self custody setup
[31:16] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:19] have to protect your privacy you have to
[31:22] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:25] on where you live you even want to have
[31:27] a plan and be a citizenship where you
[31:29] can move in case something goes really
[31:32] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:34] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[31:36] step by step and if you visit the
[31:39] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[31:43] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[31:46] out how you can level up your
[31:48] sovereignty absolutely and it's I guess
[31:51] the real estate Community likes that
[31:53] there's a cash flow in Bitcoin like
[31:54] there there's no yield on bitcoin but
[31:56] with Bitcoin mining like all of the
[31:58] sudden a cash flow uh and they're used
[32:00] to to cash flows and uh yeah even like
[32:04] with if you have rental properties the
[32:07] the income can also be very depending on
[32:09] if you find someone to to to live in
[32:12] there and pay consistent income but but
[32:14] yeah the real estate Community might
[32:16] also be really attracted to to the
[32:18] Bitcoin mining I think there's something
[32:20] really important that that we haven't
[32:22] talked about that's worth mentioning
[32:23] which is that I I think
[32:26] because because Bitcoin mining is so
[32:29] capitalistic I think that people that
[32:31] have showed up first looked at it from
[32:34] this cash basis and not from a a Bitcoin
[32:39] perspective and if you look at the
[32:41] Bitcoin community at large you see it
[32:43] sort of broken into two major camps
[32:46] right one Camp I I like to call and I
[32:50] picked this up from Steve Barber by the
[32:51] way so it's not not my terminology but I
[32:53] like it which is the merchant Bitcoin
[32:55] economy and then you've got the the
[32:58] other Camp which is the mining uh
[33:00] economy and if you look at those two
[33:02] camps they really don't talk to each
[33:04] other uh and primarily uh the the
[33:08] incentive that drives both of those at
[33:10] their at their core like the Bitcoin
[33:12] only companies that are in each of those
[33:14] in the mining space they're driven by
[33:15] the block reward right and in the
[33:18] merchant space it's driven by the
[33:20] exchange of Fiat into Bitcoin like those
[33:22] are really unless you've got outside
[33:24] investor Capital coming in those are
[33:26] really the only two primary ways to to
[33:29] drive value in this ecosystem and so
[33:32] they're different sets of incentives and
[33:34] I think it's taken the merchant Bitcoin
[33:37] economy quite a while to start looking
[33:39] from at a at the mining side from a
[33:42] bitcoiner perspective and right now I
[33:44] think that there's uh SAS mining I think
[33:47] ocean is doing that as well I think that
[33:50] Bob Bernett at Barefoot mining is doing
[33:52] that as well but I think that there's a
[33:53] relatively small group of companies
[33:56] right now that are serving as a bridge
[33:59] between those two ecosystems and I think
[34:02] that as we get more bitcoiners into the
[34:04] mining side we're actually going to see
[34:06] some some interesting insights and
[34:10] Innovations come out and and frankly a
[34:12] lot of the Fiat based incentives um that
[34:16] need to be purged out of the mining
[34:17] sector from my standpoint because I
[34:19] think that you you know if you're driven
[34:21] to acquire Bitcoin for for the sake of
[34:24] the dollar that's a completely sort of
[34:27] wrong mindset that can ultimately harm
[34:30] the network and I think we see that to a
[34:32] degree with how hash rate is
[34:34] Consolidated how it's wound up in a
[34:37] relatively few numbers of mining pools
[34:40] and the potential damage that that can
[34:42] do so I I do think that there's a a
[34:44] moral reason that the Bitcoin Community
[34:46] should get more involved in in Bitcoin
[34:49] mining and hopefully you know products
[34:52] like ours can create the financial
[34:53] incentive for folks to do so but I think
[34:56] it's a it's sort of imperative on us as
[34:58] bitcoiners to to protect the network and
[35:01] and do it from a um an incentive set
[35:04] that is driven on the acquisition of
[35:06] Bitcoin instead of
[35:08] Fiat absolutely do you see it as a
[35:11] problem that the Bitcoin mining pools
[35:14] are very uh very centralized I mean
[35:17] there are like a few big ones that
[35:19] basically have most of the control uh
[35:22] Bitcoin mining itself is a quite
[35:24] decentralized I think America has the
[35:26] most of like around 30% or something
[35:28] like
[35:29] that uh I think it represents a
[35:32] potential problem now it's not an actual
[35:35] problem until it is a problem right
[35:37] until there's bad behavior that occurs
[35:39] but what I I mean I I kind of think it's
[35:41] similarly like coinbase's custody
[35:44] program I think is problematic for our
[35:46] industry as well right because it
[35:48] creates a Honeypot incentive that a
[35:50] government could come in step in and
[35:53] acquire all that Bitcoin now whether
[35:55] that occurs or not you know I've cross
[35:57] my fingers it doesn't the rule of law
[35:59] stands in the US and that that's never a
[36:01] problem the uh the thing with hash rate
[36:03] though is I think it does represent a
[36:06] potential problem right so I mean if if
[36:08] antpool which is the one that's
[36:10] consolidating most of the hash rate at
[36:13] the moment I can't remember the I don't
[36:14] know the latest numbers but I know it
[36:15] was like 40% plus um of the hash rate
[36:19] was was being directed to that mining
[36:21] pool that represents a centralized force
[36:24] that you know an adverse State actor
[36:27] come in and there's a throat to choke
[36:29] there that could lead to some
[36:31] problematic um Behavior Uh on the
[36:34] Bitcoin Network as a as a result so I do
[36:37] think it's incumbent on us to uh to
[36:40] shift um our hash rate and try to get it
[36:43] more distributed so I like what Ocean's
[36:44] doing um actually working with them you
[36:47] know let's say 40% of the the hash rate
[36:49] is centralized into
[36:51] antpool there is now an incentive that a
[36:54] state actor could come along and there's
[36:56] a throat to joke there uh so to speak
[36:59] that could lead to some adverse behavior
[37:01] on the Bitcoin Network so I do think
[37:03] it's incumbent on us not that it will
[37:05] happen but that we take away that
[37:07] incentive by Distributing the hash rate
[37:10] with you know uh mining pools that are
[37:12] more aligned with the network such as
[37:15] ocean which we're in the in the process
[37:17] of uh integrating with so that we can
[37:19] offer it to our client base right now we
[37:21] currently offer Luxor but uh we're going
[37:24] to offer uh ocean before too much longer
[37:27] uh I don't have an exact time frame on
[37:29] that but we want to give our clients the
[37:30] choice of Mighty pools and it's been a
[37:33] very requested feature too from our
[37:34] clients that's one of the the heartening
[37:36] parts of of serving the Bitcoin
[37:39] community that is looking to mine and
[37:41] acquires hats is they genuinely care
[37:43] about the network you know uh they they
[37:46] want us to offer ocean and so that
[37:47] motivates us to figure how to get that
[37:49] done for our clients absolutely bit
[37:51] bitcoiners are the best driving force uh
[37:56] like if if you have bitcoiners a Bitcoin
[37:58] company they will tell you how uh it's
[38:02] best for not only them but for for the
[38:05] Bitcoin Network overall it's it's an
[38:07] interesting customer base uh to have
[38:09] because they look out outside of
[38:12] themselves also which is rare I think in
[38:15] customer
[38:17] bases well yeah customer bases um and I
[38:22] I think our staff you know I've I've
[38:24] hired intentionally um you know we're an
[38:27] early stage startup so that comes with a
[38:29] lot of challenges with it and I found
[38:32] that in the beginning I was open to
[38:34] people that uh weren't uh completely
[38:37] orange build let's say and now that's
[38:40] one of the primary things that I look
[38:41] for and screen for right off the bat is
[38:43] I I do some questioning to just ensure
[38:46] people are orange build because if they
[38:48] don't have that sense of higher purpose
[38:50] of what it means uh what bitcoin's
[38:53] impact can be on on society then they
[38:57] can get lost in the hardships that come
[38:59] with an early stage startup you know
[39:00] with a lot of moving pieces but if
[39:02] they've got that higher purpose about
[39:04] them then you know those hardships are
[39:06] like okay cool it's just another another
[39:09] another challenge to overcome let's get
[39:10] it done super interesting um one thing
[39:13] that I want to note still from antpool
[39:16] when we um when we played that scenario
[39:20] of like actually a state actor comes in
[39:23] and tries to get after end poool um from
[39:26] from your experience
[39:28] how how big of an impact would that
[39:30] actually be wouldn't the minus be
[39:32] possible to just like switch to another
[39:34] pool or like it seems like the even if
[39:37] they choke the ant pool um the the
[39:41] miners are still somewhere else uh and
[39:43] they can still just switch the the the
[39:46] mining pool well this is this is the
[39:49] particularly Insidious uh issue with
[39:51] this at this particular point is that
[39:55] there it wasn't even known until I'd say
[39:57] the last six to eight months how big of
[39:59] a problem this was because there's been
[40:01] a lot of backro deals that allow proxy
[40:05] pools to point and redirect their hash
[40:08] rate to ant pool so in essence you've
[40:10] got ant pools here and then you've got
[40:12] these other layers that don't say
[40:14] they're anol but wind up directing their
[40:16] hash rate to ampool so what's the
[40:19] problem if you don't want to mine with
[40:20] ampool is who do you point your hash
[40:23] rate to that's not ampool and that's
[40:25] where really uh ocean is one of the few
[40:28] that that's able to say hey look our
[40:30] code is all transparent you know um
[40:33] maybe it's not quite yet but that's
[40:35] their intention but at least you can see
[40:37] that because there's no holding place
[40:40] for the rewards as they come about like
[40:42] that there's there's no way for that
[40:46] centralization um to occur in the same
[40:48] way they're not being a proxy it's just
[40:50] a completely different design now if you
[40:53] don't have that level of transparency
[40:55] you can't actually say and I think that
[40:58] there are some pools out there that we
[41:00] don't think are ant pool that actually
[41:02] are proxies for ant pool so are you
[41:04] really shifting your hash weight away
[41:06] from it or not you know that's that's a
[41:08] that's that's an open question that
[41:10] can't be very well resolved right now
[41:12] with the lack of
[41:13] transparency yeah we it's it's
[41:16] definitely a thing where uh the Bitcoin
[41:18] Community still has to um get better in
[41:22] and we we improve it really interesting
[41:25] insights um let's get um a little bit of
[41:28] a different uh Pace in here um when we
[41:31] talk about Bitcoin mining it brings a
[41:34] lot of
[41:35] interesting um a lot of
[41:38] interesting how advantages to to Earth
[41:43] if I say so uh to with different
[41:47] perspectives like the crit stabilization
[41:49] with uh mining in in areas where there
[41:52] couldn't be any plants but now there can
[41:55] be because all of the sudden
[41:57] it can be profitable with with Bitcoin
[42:00] mining um how do you see Bitcoin mining
[42:04] playing a role in the transforming
[42:06] energy or maybe in the future in the
[42:07] energy markets what insights did you
[42:10] already gain with with with SAS mining
[42:12] from
[42:13] that oh man this is a this is a big
[42:15] subject um Robin and and one I'm quite
[42:19] passionate about uh and the reason why
[42:21] is because I I grew up on a farm I work
[42:23] for over a decade in the rooftop solar
[42:25] industry so kind of a drive forc for
[42:28] myself personally is the the
[42:29] harmonization of humanity with the
[42:31] planet and bit sad to watch the ESG
[42:35] movement sort of co-opt what rooftop
[42:37] solar could be um for its own sort of
[42:40] narratives uh but you know when it comes
[42:43] right down to it that there's a major
[42:45] problem on the grids which is energy is
[42:48] not always produced at the time or the
[42:51] place where it's needed and that
[42:54] dislocation always causes very low cost
[42:57] energy to occur and the lowcost energy
[43:01] is the energy the Bitcoin miners want
[43:03] and so if there the Hydro Dam is too far
[43:07] away from the city center or the it's
[43:10] night um and there's there's no
[43:13] electricity being generated from a solar
[43:15] farm or the wind's not blowing you know
[43:18] these are all things that Bitcoin mining
[43:21] can mesh with um is this variability so
[43:24] what I see is that Bitcoin mining over
[43:27] over time um can sort of even out uh the
[43:31] grid uh completely uh while monetizing
[43:35] that in the process so let me let me
[43:38] give a more clear example um so if we
[43:40] back up the grid itself is and this is
[43:43] shocking for a lot of people to discover
[43:45] this but you can't store electricity not
[43:48] not very cost effectively you can in
[43:50] batteries but it's it to scale that is
[43:53] quite quite challenging but let's just
[43:55] set aside batteries for a moment uh
[43:57] because it's relatively new new
[43:59] development on the grid but the way the
[44:00] grid works is you use it or you lose it
[44:03] 100% right um and so what is generated
[44:08] and put on the power grid from from you
[44:11] know whether that's water falling
[44:13] whether it's atoms being split whether
[44:14] that's sun shining you know the
[44:17] electricity is generated um is put on
[44:19] the grid and the grid operator has to
[44:22] balance that with all the loads that are
[44:24] on the grid that are consuming that
[44:25] electricity so when there's too much
[44:28] power that's put on the grid they
[44:30] they've got to figure out how do I
[44:32] dispel it do I ask a different power
[44:34] generators to turn off uh and then vice
[44:37] versa if there's too much load on the
[44:39] grid they've got to figure out okay how
[44:41] do I reduce that and that's where all
[44:43] the complexity comes from is just
[44:44] balancing supply and demand because
[44:47] there's not really an effective storage
[44:48] mechanism when it comes to electricity
[44:50] not a costeffective one and that's where
[44:53] Bitcoin mining shines is the ability to
[44:56] come in and and consume the excess on
[44:59] either side um and the what I see sort
[45:03] of a popular quote I think Brandon
[45:05] quidam is the the originator of it who
[45:07] happens to be an adviser of SAS mining
[45:09] but you know Bitcoin mining sort of
[45:11] teaches you everything that you don't
[45:13] know about Bitcoin uh and everything you
[45:16] don't know about energy and so
[45:18] ultimately I see just as Bitcoin is
[45:20] forced this
[45:21] conversation uh on answering the
[45:24] question what is money I think Bitcoin
[45:26] is also forcing the question and the
[45:29] conversation around what is energy and
[45:32] how do our grids work interesting it's
[45:35] also it's also probably from your
[45:38] standpoint uh hard to decide like where
[45:41] to even start to mine Bitcoin because
[45:44] that's like the world is basically the
[45:47] the possibility you can mine everywhere
[45:49] because it's just like you need an
[45:50] internet connection uh and and some uh
[45:53] some uh form of electricity uh I've seen
[45:57] I think on the website that you do
[45:59] Norway power cry right now if you shop
[46:02] if you shop uh rigs um how do you go
[46:05] ahead and decide where to mine Bitcoin
[46:07] if you have so much space where you
[46:11] could mine Bitcoin well let me let me
[46:14] break that question down into just like
[46:16] a couple of steps and just back up
[46:17] because I think it's important to
[46:19] understand that the incentive from a
[46:21] mining perspective is to find the lowest
[46:23] cost electricity and the lowest cost
[46:26] electricity is electricity it's produced
[46:28] in either the wrong CA wrong place or
[46:30] the the wrong time maybe both right and
[46:34] so that's where the cheapest power comes
[46:35] from and most of that power is renewable
[46:38] that's why the incentives are are set up
[46:40] such that we see the Bitcoin Network at
[46:43] I think
[46:44] 57% uh carbon- free Power at this point
[46:46] and growing uh so it's the it's the
[46:49] cleanest industry in the world it's also
[46:51] the cleanest uh if you consider the the
[46:53] Bitcoin Network to be a state a network
[46:55] State um it's actually the cleanest uh
[46:58] State on the planet as well um just from
[47:02] a complete carbon emission standpoint
[47:05] but as far as where you want to operate
[47:08] you know for us what we do is we
[47:11] contract Rackspace uh and so we take a
[47:15] very long amount of time to find a data
[47:18] center operator that we can trust uh our
[47:21] clients with and we spend a long time
[47:24] negotiating out the contracts and
[47:26] basically dealing with all the potential
[47:27] conflicts that can happen up front that
[47:29] takes months um to to have and that's
[47:32] really like probably core to our value
[47:34] proposition but start we start with the
[47:36] trust basis of the data center operator
[47:38] then we've got hey what's the energy
[47:40] source because we only offer carbon free
[47:43] um Power to our clients and then it's uh
[47:47] then after that it is okay how much
[47:51] space and what's it going to cost our
[47:53] clients so there has to be a clear value
[47:55] proposition there and if all all those
[47:57] things align and the rule of law is
[48:01] fairly strong in a jurisdiction then we
[48:03] can move forward with offering that to
[48:05] our clients and so far that's led us to
[48:08] um we've got a data center in Wisconsin
[48:11] uh data center in Paraguay and one in
[48:14] Norway and the one in Norway is our
[48:16] newest and it's also quite Innovative
[48:19] because the heat that's being generated
[48:21] from Bitcoin mining is being utilized to
[48:23] heat the building that the data center
[48:25] is in because this data centers North of
[48:27] the Arctic Circle um and it's sort of a
[48:31] fascinating project first of its kind
[48:33] where the average person can participate
[48:35] in in heat reuse it's all powered by
[48:38] hydroelectric uh energy and the heat is
[48:41] going to go to to reutilize or heat the
[48:44] building and the building owner is
[48:47] paying for that heat because it's
[48:49] cheaper for them to buy the heat from
[48:51] the data center than it is to run uh a
[48:54] boiler and in fact they're actually able
[48:56] to remove an oil powerered boiler uh
[48:59] from the building as a result of the
[49:00] data center uh becoming operational it
[49:03] uh I led uh so much because we we had
[49:07] that discussion around uh Bitcoin mining
[49:11] being bad for an environment uh and
[49:13] anybody that saw a little bit closer in
[49:17] in the community and actually uh saw
[49:19] what Bitcoin mining is saw that that's
[49:22] just yes that's just like you you did
[49:25] not do any research you're just like
[49:26] like throwing out numbers out of context
[49:29] um and I feel like since blackr is in
[49:32] the game uh that um um that Narrative of
[49:38] Bitcoin being bad for environment kind
[49:39] of vanished I don't know if that has
[49:41] anything to do with black rock entering
[49:43] but it seems like this year was kind of
[49:44] the death of that
[49:46] narrative uh and it really evolved now
[49:49] in or Bitcoin mining can stabilize the
[49:51] grid Bitcoin mining uh can incentivize
[49:55] uh renewable energy it can reuse energy
[49:58] like the heat as you just mentioned in
[50:01] that example and I think that's
[50:02] beautiful I think that's that's really
[50:04] great and uh I'm really looking forward
[50:07] when all those uh green movements all
[50:10] those environment movements uh if if
[50:13] they are honestly driven by environment
[50:15] and not politically driven by some
[50:17] communist agenda if they're actually
[50:19] honestly driven by environment they have
[50:21] to come to the conclusion Bitcoin mining
[50:24] is something great for the environment
[50:26] is something great for our
[50:28] Nations yeah I 100% agree with it I mean
[50:31] it's it's thank God the ESG narrative is
[50:34] dying because now we can actually get
[50:36] back to just like okay let's actually
[50:38] just worry about the environment instead
[50:40] of like posturing that we care about it
[50:43] um and so you know is as H as maybe an
[50:46] anecdote to to this point you know I I
[50:49] worked in rooftop solar for about a
[50:50] decade I left that industry in 2014 so
[50:53] it's been about a decade since but I
[50:54] still have close friends you know best
[50:56] man from my wedding uh was is still in
[50:59] that industry and talk to him all the
[51:01] time and he's like oh my gosh man like
[51:03] I'm seeing it I'm I'm seeing where uh
[51:06] Bitcoin mining and solar make a lot of
[51:07] sense so I see that industry coming
[51:09] around and you know Daniel baton just P
[51:12] published or or made the community aware
[51:15] of a relatively new study that just came
[51:17] out that showed that the the payback
[51:20] period on a solar system now uh can be
[51:23] reduced from 8.7 years to like 3.7 years
[51:27] if it's partnered with Bitcoin mining so
[51:29] these theoretical things uh that we have
[51:32] talked about are now being proven out in
[51:35] like academic papers you know this is a
[51:37] white paper that I'm just referring to
[51:39] that Daniel baton published and you can
[51:40] go read the abstract and see no it's
[51:43] true like the uh the the numbers are
[51:46] there and and no amount of crying
[51:48] nashing her teeth and and uh complaining
[51:51] about what we should be using
[51:53] electricity for because Bitcoin mining
[51:55] isn't valuable can change the fact that
[51:58] it is uh continuing to go up in price
[52:01] and um that it is a cost effective way
[52:04] to bring more Renewables online
[52:06] absolutely 100% agree um before we come
[52:09] to the to the end question of the
[52:11] podcast um one thing we kind of talked a
[52:15] lot about about 2024 already um what do
[52:18] you expect for for next year what are
[52:20] you excited about next year what is kind
[52:23] of like uh your outlook what you excited
[52:25] about oh oh
[52:28] man next year I just feel so incredibly
[52:33] bullish about the potential and there's
[52:35] so many different ways that next year
[52:37] can go but no matter which way it goes
[52:40] it just looks extremely bullish for
[52:43] Bitcoin right like next year genuinely
[52:45] could and and I give this small
[52:47] percentage odds here still but next year
[52:50] could be the phase shift year right
[52:52] where we get crazy nation state adoption
[52:55] happening and everyone and their their
[52:57] mother suddenly adopting Bitcoin in
[52:59] masses and we see the god candles and
[53:01] you know no more Bitcoin left on
[53:03] exchanges to acquire because the last
[53:05] 2.2 million that was freely available on
[53:09] exchanges aren't available and now
[53:11] everybody has to mine Bitcoin like that
[53:13] could happen right I give that
[53:14] relatively low odds I think we've still
[53:17] probably got another cycle maybe two
[53:19] before we hit that sort of phase shift
[53:21] but it could um and I think most
[53:24] importantly though is that this cycle is
[53:27] the cycle that locks in bitcoin's store
[53:29] of value use case I I think we get to
[53:32] the end of that um adoption curve and
[53:34] then we start moving into the medium of
[53:37] exchange adoption curve now as far as
[53:40] how that plays out what nation states
[53:42] set up and and sit down at the table and
[53:45] adopt or what states in the US even
[53:48] because there's talk of different states
[53:50] I just think it's all up for grabs right
[53:52] now and there's a bit of a a land rush
[53:56] that's occurring on the nation state
[53:58] level uh and and that's shocking to me
[54:00] because I expected corporations to move
[54:02] ahead of nation state actors but you
[54:05] know I think all bets are off next year
[54:07] but in a bullish and and very exciting
[54:09] way and so I think that that we're in
[54:12] for the the the main event uh this is my
[54:15] third cycle and and this is the first
[54:18] one that I sort of feel prepared for uh
[54:20] and prepared meaning that I know I'm
[54:23] completely unprepared and ready to eat a
[54:25] bunch of and watch it all play out but
[54:28] excited to see what that reality
[54:29] actually
[54:31] is yeah you can never be ready for what
[54:34] what's Bitcoin bringing to you but you
[54:36] can be ready to um just uh sit back and
[54:40] enjoy it well here's what I really love
[54:44] too so Robin you know I don't know if it
[54:47] was caught on recording but we met a
[54:48] couple weeks ago in El Salvador right
[54:50] like in the last year I've just been
[54:52] reflecting on where bitcoin's taken me
[54:55] Paraguay nor Norway Netherlands Portugal
[55:00] the US several times like I'm going to
[55:02] be in in in medine in Columbia next
[55:05] month I mean if you're part of Bitcoin
[55:07] and part of this movement and like
[55:09] putting your shoulder against the wall
[55:10] like Bitcoin itself takes you places
[55:13] that you just can't even imagine uh that
[55:15] you'd be and and puts you in circles and
[55:17] conversations with people that you just
[55:19] can't even expect like you know you were
[55:21] backstage and we briefly met I didn't
[55:23] know that I was going to be a podcast
[55:25] talking to you and your audience just
[55:27] two weeks later but uh it's kind of the
[55:29] magical serendipitous side of things and
[55:31] I think that's what gets me the most
[55:33] excit is just meeting just amazing
[55:35] people that genuinely care about this
[55:37] value set of separating money and state
[55:40] that just is really unusual it's brought
[55:42] together some really really cool
[55:45] Fascinating People that I just always
[55:46] learn a ton
[55:48] from 100% it's it's it's crazy how the
[55:53] Bitcoin Community sucks you in and gives
[55:55] you opport is if you're willing to do
[55:58] the proof of work uh in the community
[56:00] and provide some some value um now
[56:03] coming to a question that each and every
[56:05] one of my guests uh is getting what can
[56:07] we learn from you outside of
[56:11] Bitcoin oh that's that's one of my
[56:14] favorite questions so um I think that A
[56:19] Life Lesson that I can learn that or
[56:21] share that I didn't understand when I
[56:22] was in my in my my 20s was that
[56:27] the idea of
[56:28] sovereign uh being a material um thing
[56:32] is is just not true um and you need to
[56:35] work on yourself uh you need to develop
[56:39] yourself and I don't mean just
[56:40] physically but I mean emotionally
[56:43] psychologically uh and do the proof of
[56:45] work in those Arenas in life to really
[56:48] develop the the most um satisfactory
[56:52] rewards in life it's not because even if
[56:55] you get uh to the endgame and and win
[56:58] the rat race and and have a huge pile of
[57:01] Bitcoin and and are sitting on that
[57:03] you're still going to be with yourself
[57:06] uh once you have all that material
[57:07] wealth and and if you're dissatisfied
[57:10] with
[57:10] yourself all the money in the world
[57:12] isn't going to change that so you know
[57:15] developing that relationship with
[57:16] yourself and and getting yourself
[57:18] comfortable in your own skin I think is
[57:20] is an under undervalued and and
[57:23] underappreciated aspect of maturing that
[57:26] I encourage all bitcoiners to go through
[57:27] and and spend time focusing on and with
[57:30] Bitcoin that Journey gets easier while
[57:34] you don't have to worry too much about
[57:36] finances that's that's at least the the
[57:38] hope I have for all the bitcoiners uh
[57:40] out there really cool we have endro in
[57:42] the podcast where the previous guest is
[57:45] asking a question for the next guest
[57:47] without knowing who the next guest
[57:49] actually is and the question from the
[57:50] previous guest for you is who is the
[57:53] most important person for you to pill in
[57:57] your local area um seeing like the mayor
[58:01] a teacher whoever it might be basically
[58:04] the person that would make the the
[58:07] biggest impact for Bitcoin in your
[58:09] region so I I I'm going to say uh the
[58:14] name of the fellow that I'm thinking of
[58:16] is uh Jack mid um so it's a name
[58:20] bitcoiners haven't heard of but uh he's
[58:22] a French doctor that came to my area of
[58:26] Peru about 32 years ago and he started a
[58:30] uh an NGO that treats drug addiction
[58:33] using a combination of Amazonian plant
[58:37] medicine and yian talk therapy and has a
[58:40] success rate with it of about twice what
[58:43] uh traditional uh clinics and treatment
[58:45] programs use and it is a clinic that
[58:49] draws in people from geez all over the
[58:52] planet to to show up here uh where we
[58:55] live or near where we live and I think
