[00:00] Most people will hold Bitcoin but not
[00:02] realize that they really hold it. It'll
[00:03] be part of their 401k, right? It's
[00:04] they're not like getting their hardware
[00:06] wallet, throw it in, getting their own
[00:07] private key, stamping their seedwords
[00:09] into metal. You know, it's probably not
[00:10] for most people. They don't have the
[00:12] time, right, to research most people,
[00:13] right? We're just too busy. Everyone is
[00:15] fighting inflation and running on that
[00:17] hamster wheel and it's just getting
[00:18] harder and harder to to free up time to
[00:21] do things. We do sell the news, but also
[00:23] there was no purchasing of new Bitcoin,
[00:25] which we thought they were going to do.
[00:27] who I think it was a million bitcoin a
[00:28] year or 5 years to fund the reserve
[00:31] something like that ton of bitcoin that
[00:32] would have dropped through on the price
[00:33] up so there's not necessarily like a
[00:35] commitment to buy bitcoin with like a
[00:37] new money I know that they swept in um a
[00:39] lot of the confiscated bitcoin to that
[00:41] reserve and then from what it sounds
[00:43] like dumped the shitcoins to buy more
[00:45] bitcoin with it but I think it's just
[00:46] you know they're in it's like the
[00:47] biggest deal in the world for us right
[00:49] and we're like oh if a strategic bitcoin
[00:50] uh reserve gets announced it's going to
[00:52] be hard to buy bitcoin under 100k you
[00:54] know get it while it's five digits
[00:55] before you can ever get while it's five
[00:57] digits again and then it happens and
[00:58] it's just like wow at the end of the day
[01:00] holding real Bitcoin and cold storage uh
[01:02] is a
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] superpower. I I'm super envy what what's
[01:10] going on in in the states in in Bitcoin.
[01:12] There's so much happening and so much uh
[01:14] talk about in Europe. It's just on the
[01:17] political level. I mean now uh it's it's
[01:20] just very almost silent. They they don't
[01:23] want and if they say something it's
[01:24] usually disappointing from a Bitcoin
[01:26] perspective. Sure. Yeah. No, it's it's
[01:29] definitely like one of those times where
[01:31] um years happen in days, right? like
[01:34] that's that's kind of where we're at
[01:35] since um the new you know elections have
[01:38] you know changes that come and luckily
[01:39] Bitcoin was able to ride in on that
[01:42] change and we were all very optimistic
[01:43] and then we were a little scared for a
[01:45] little bit there was a little
[01:46] shitcoinery going on for for that brief
[01:48] period of time with the executive order
[01:50] for the uh researching digital assets
[01:53] and you know what Salana XRP all these
[01:57] old coins become part of the reserve but
[01:58] we broke through it's kind of like uh
[02:00] the federal government had their
[02:01] shitcoin interface at at a very hyper
[02:03] rapid pace and yeah, we're we're full
[02:06] Bitcoin now or at least we're heading
[02:08] that way. So, it's it's exciting but
[02:10] like it's also interesting um because
[02:12] like I was listening to a podcast from
[02:14] Sailor back from 2020, one of the Sailor
[02:17] series and he's some a person podcast
[02:19] he's talking about the strategic Bitcoin
[02:21] reserve if that became a thing in the
[02:22] US, the implications of it, what it
[02:24] would mean. And I'm just sitting there
[02:25] listening. I'm like here we are today
[02:26] and it really doesn't even feel like it
[02:28] happened. It's like things happen in
[02:30] Bitcoin and then you know it's almost
[02:31] like Bitcoin doesn't care. we don't
[02:33] care. We move past it so fast and it's
[02:35] like what's the next thing because you
[02:37] know it's inevitable and you know it's
[02:39] just the US is a big signal to take our
[02:41] strategic reserve right but other
[02:43] countries will follow and other things
[02:45] will happen and um it's just kind of
[02:47] like all right what's the next thing
[02:48] just like when we hit 100k it was like
[02:50] we got tired of it after a while you
[02:52] know it was like we're we're sitting at
[02:53] like 102 for the longest time so we get
[02:56] we get um excited for things and then
[02:57] they happen and it's like okay it
[02:59] happened you know and it's I think it's
[03:00] like part of us in the back of our head
[03:02] we kind of know that it's going to
[03:03] happen because we've studied Bitcoin and
[03:04] we understand its implications and how
[03:07] it ultimately is inevitable on a global
[03:09] level. People will just go where Bitcoin
[03:10] is. Um so it's not much of a surprise.
[03:13] But um like you were saying with Europe
[03:15] that I think like I saw in Prague like
[03:17] they're embracing it fully, right? I
[03:19] know that that's um I saw some news come
[03:20] out a few weeks back um you know the
[03:23] central bank I think in Prague is
[03:24] embracing Bitcoin or something to that
[03:26] effect, right? Yeah, it's uh they are
[03:28] it's it's early stages, but they passed
[03:32] like a motion to investigate if they
[03:35] should put Bitcoin on the balance sheet.
[03:38] So, they first had to pass that that
[03:41] they even are able to research that and
[03:45] investigate that and now they currently
[03:47] researching that and investigating that.
[03:49] And it's it's interesting because the
[03:51] European Union, I think Chris uh Lagard
[03:55] is just saying, oh, like they will not
[03:57] do it. Uh they're not stupid basically
[03:59] and and they're not putting Bitcoin on.
[04:01] She she's talking in in that kind of a
[04:03] way. But if you look what what Czech is
[04:06] saying, they they they really I think
[04:08] are moving forward. They also recently
[04:11] passed a law that if you hold Bitcoin
[04:13] longer for than 3 years, it's tax-free,
[04:17] which is a a major step. Uh it's also
[04:20] similar in Germany where you hold if you
[04:22] hold Bitcoin for one year or longer uh
[04:25] it's taxfree. So there there are
[04:27] definitely positive things going on.
[04:29] It's just not as big of a discussion as
[04:32] in in the states which is as a bit of as
[04:36] a Bitcoin in in in Europe kind of uh sad
[04:40] for me to see. Sure. I I could see that
[04:42] there's a lot of things happening and uh
[04:44] like I was in Were you were you in
[04:45] Nashville? I I think you were right. Oh,
[04:48] unfortunately not. Uh this this year Las
[04:50] Vegas I will be and it will be my first
[04:53] American conference. Nice. Yeah. I mean
[04:55] that's going to be crazy conference,
[04:57] right? There's so much excitement around
[04:59] that Vegas show because it's a location
[05:01] that that you know conference has never
[05:03] been and they get bigger every year. Um
[05:05] but I I've been at three of them so far
[05:07] like the Bitcoin conference ones and um
[05:09] Nashville was just on a totally
[05:11] different level. the amount of
[05:12] excitement um because of the guests
[05:14] there like let's face it you had um
[05:17] Trump was there RFK was there so you
[05:19] have two people who are running for
[05:22] president at a Bitcoin conference and it
[05:24] it was just like I had FOMO going to it
[05:26] like I was going but I had FOMO because
[05:28] I you know we're stamp seed so we set up
[05:31] our booth there for people to demo you
[05:33] know what it feels like to stamp your
[05:35] seedwords into metal give people that
[05:37] feel for the first time so I'm busy the
[05:39] whole weekend I I can't really step out
[05:41] and do
[05:42] Um, so I had FOMO going to it and I mean
[05:45] the amount of people there was just
[05:47] insane. I mean you had lines that
[05:49] wrapped around the exhibit floor that
[05:51] have like never happened before to to
[05:53] wait in line to get to some of these uh
[05:55] sessions because you had security and
[05:58] secret service things like that. But um
[06:00] just the size of the conference was
[06:01] insane. There's so much excitement
[06:02] around it and even people um in my life
[06:05] who aren't in Bitcoin were asking about
[06:08] it. Um it's becoming mainstream. you
[06:10] know, you go to the news news uh
[06:12] stations or like media areas at at these
[06:15] conferences and now you have serious
[06:17] media outlets there. So, you know, they
[06:18] they're seeing the excitement and
[06:20] they're going to keep coming and it's
[06:21] just going to keep getting larger and
[06:22] larger. So, like um these conferences
[06:24] are becoming huge events and less of
[06:27] that like meetup feel that some of the
[06:28] more niche, you know, Bitcoin
[06:30] conferences have. But, um it's a lot of
[06:32] excitement, man. It it really is a kind
[06:34] of like a crazy time to be alive
[06:36] throughout all this. Um we we've we've
[06:39] lived through interesting times on you
[06:40] know the dawn of the internet and now
[06:42] the next phase um you know monetizing I
[06:45] guess the internet as best as possible
[06:47] through bitcoin. Um so it's uh we're
[06:51] it's a very unique time to be living
[06:52] man. It's it's insane.
[06:54] Absolutely. I couldn't agree more with
[06:57] that. Um maybe let's touch one more time
[07:00] on on the strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[07:02] what's what's kind of happening there.
[07:03] what what is the implication that you
[07:05] you you I'm also uh thinking about
[07:09] because I listened to the sailor series
[07:10] but I I cannot remember what what sailor
[07:12] said of the implications maybe you can
[07:14] uh recall that um uh what is kind of the
[07:18] implication of that strategic bitcoin
[07:20] reserve long term because currently yeah
[07:22] it does not shortterm it's not doing
[07:24] anything because they're not buying even
[07:26] bitcoin it's just like holding the the
[07:27] ones it's it's more of a how to frame it
[07:30] currently and not really an implication
[07:32] there what do you think it will be the
[07:34] long-term view of that. So yeah, I mean
[07:37] like the where we're at now is the the
[07:38] price dropped after the reserve was
[07:40] announced because um you know people do
[07:43] sell the news but also there was no
[07:45] purchasing of new Bitcoin which we
[07:47] thought they were going to do. I think
[07:48] it was a million Bitcoin a year for five
[07:51] years um to fund the reserve something
[07:53] like that. It's not a bitcoin that would
[07:55] have dropped through the price up. So
[07:56] there's not necessarily like a
[07:58] commitment to buy bitcoin with like new
[08:01] money. I know that they swept in um a
[08:03] lot of the confiscated Bitcoin to that
[08:05] reserve and then um they're going to
[08:08] from what it sounds like dump the
[08:10] shitcoins to buy more Bitcoin with it.
[08:12] But I think it's just you know they're
[08:14] in like I look at it okay like um
[08:17] ultimately they're going to be
[08:18] purchasing Bitcoin and I I I haven't
[08:20] really looked into exactly why they
[08:21] haven't yet but I do believe the reason
[08:23] is because there's a lot of government
[08:25] cutting right now for government spend
[08:27] through Doge. So I I think it kind of
[08:30] goes against what they're trying to do
[08:32] to fund something else, right? So I I
[08:35] think it has a little bit to do with
[08:36] that. Um but ultimately I see the US
[08:39] purchasing uh certain amount of Bitcoin
[08:42] per year because it it's really and I'm
[08:44] surprised they haven't yet. I think it
[08:46] has to do with the previous regime. Um I
[08:48] know the previous regime uh were like
[08:51] more into XRP and kind of on that side
[08:54] um a little bit or they're at least
[08:56] being wind and dined by that side. Um,
[08:58] so I think it's just a matter of time
[09:00] ultimately because when you look at game
[09:02] theory sort of plays out, if other
[09:04] countries purchase this Bitcoin, it's a
[09:06] form of power and El Salvador has a huge
[09:08] head start on on most others. Um, and
[09:12] there's only so many Bitcoin, right?
[09:13] Just like um, regular plebs are fighting
[09:15] or not fighting but doing everything
[09:18] they can do to get as much Bitcoin as
[09:19] possible to front run the next segment
[09:21] that's coming in. That same thing is
[09:22] going to happen at the nation state
[09:23] level. at the corporate level too. Um,
[09:26] you know, there's definitely a benefit
[09:27] to being the first one there. Um, so
[09:30] ultimately I see them, you know, I I
[09:33] can't see turning back from from here.
[09:36] Um, I just the one thing that worries me
[09:38] is um, which I I haven't really heard
[09:39] much people talk about this, but I want
[09:41] to see what your thoughts are. Um,
[09:44] but obviously like the US is extremely
[09:47] polarized, right? It more than ever. I
[09:50] mean, it's it's kind of like it's almost
[09:52] impossible to go on social media and
[09:54] just deal with it because it's such an
[09:55] echo chamber and it's impossible, right?
[09:58] So, like my fear is that if people right
[10:00] half the country hates Trump, maybe less
[10:02] than half. Um, if he embraces Bitcoin,
[10:05] does that align Bitcoin with the right,
[10:07] right? Is is there and a lot of
[10:09] Bitcoiners are on the right. We have a
[10:12] lot of uh, you know, right side values.
[10:14] A lot of the things we do and say have
[10:16] coincide with that. Obviously, there's
[10:18] left and right Bitcoiners, but I just
[10:20] worry that it becomes kind of
[10:21] politicized. And if the next regime
[10:23] comes in, who knows, right? It's it's
[10:25] kind of like unpredictable. So, that's
[10:27] like the only fear that I have. Um, you
[10:30] know, if Trump like leans into Bitcoin
[10:32] extremely, um, which I guess he kind of
[10:35] did, like he has a Bitcoin watch,
[10:37] Bitcoin shoes. It's it's kind of
[10:39] interesting how he's branded himself out
[10:40] with it. But I just get worried that
[10:42] that, you know, becomes something other
[10:43] people don't want to embrace just
[10:45] because there's a person behind it. And
[10:47] you I I hate the idea of like one person
[10:50] being behind Bitcoin. I think it's bad
[10:52] for it. Like that's why I think if
[10:53] Satoshi ever revealed his name, I I
[10:55] think it would be the worst thing for
[10:56] Bitcoin. Um I just don't think people
[11:00] people like to hate. People like to find
[11:02] weaknesses and you know, if you don't
[11:04] like the person, you won't invest in the
[11:06] coin. So or or hold it. So that that's
[11:08] the one thing that worries me. But
[11:09] ultimately, I think, you know, Bitcoin's
[11:12] inevitable. It's just a matter of what
[11:13] your time preference is.
[11:15] It's it's super interesting to think
[11:17] about that, but I don't know if you have
[11:20] seen that. Um, I even interviewed uh one
[11:23] or two of those people. There is a there
[11:26] was a big movement of bitcoiners for
[11:28] Harris. um they collected bitcoins, they
[11:33] collected money and and they actually
[11:35] because of those things and because also
[11:38] Trump was turning more and more for
[11:39] bitcoin um
[11:42] the uh administration or the election
[11:45] group around Camel Harris was getting
[11:47] more and more um pro bitcoin to the end
[11:50] of the uh till the end uh where the
[11:53] election actually was. So, I do and and
[11:57] actually every time uh I posted a very
[12:00] pro like Trump guy that came onto the
[12:03] podcast that talked about Bitcoin, I
[12:06] usually got comments of like, oh, like
[12:08] I'm a Democrat on Bitcoiner. I I I hate
[12:10] Trump. like there there is certainly I
[12:13] think like a a big silent group that
[12:17] really voted for Camel Harris, really is
[12:19] a Democrat and and really doesn't like
[12:22] Trump and doesn't like uh uh the the
[12:25] Republicans that are still Bitcoiners.
[12:28] Um uh and they probably are not the
[12:31] majority. I think the majority is
[12:33] probably on the Republican side. Um, but
[12:36] there is a a a good amount of people
[12:39] that are Democrats. I mean, it's just
[12:42] something that I observed from afar.
[12:44] Like I was literally one time in America
[12:46] for like 3 days. So it's I I don't have
[12:48] any insights in America, but from all
[12:51] the people from America that I spoke to
[12:52] and from my comments, I can see that
[12:55] there are Democrats, that there are
[12:57] people uh outside of of the Trump uh
[13:01] gang, if you so if you so will that are
[13:04] for Bitcoin. And I think it's
[13:05] innovatable that Bitcoin is a political
[13:07] thing because it's so important in our
[13:10] uh in our society that politicians have
[13:13] to talk about it. And if politicians
[13:17] start talking about a thing, it gets
[13:19] political if if you know what I mean.
[13:21] Bitcoin doesn't care, but it it gets in
[13:23] the eye of the society political. Yeah,
[13:25] I I think I agree with that fully. But
[13:28] um part of like the concern I I was
[13:30] saying would mention before is people
[13:32] tend to like I'm thinking about the next
[13:34] wave of people coming in, right? We're
[13:36] we're working towards mass adoption.
[13:37] We're not nearly there yet. And people
[13:40] still think that Bitcoin uses too much
[13:42] energy and it's bad for the environment
[13:44] and it boils oceans and it's used for
[13:46] terrorism and it's used for drugs. So,
[13:49] and like people kind of hear these
[13:50] things once and then it becomes their
[13:52] talking point because you know Operation
[13:54] Mockingbird sort of effect. All these
[13:56] mainstream media guys are saying pretty
[13:58] much the same exact thing, right? Elon
[13:59] Musk posted something with like maybe
[14:02] like 20 screenshots of people just kind
[14:04] of chirping the same thing and echoing
[14:05] it. So that's a very powerful tool that
[14:08] most people don't have time to even read
[14:10] one book a year. So they kind of pick up
[14:13] these headlines on social media or you
[14:15] know mainstream media and they hear
[14:17] everyone talking about it becomes a
[14:18] thing. Bitcoin's bad, right? So I just
[14:20] worry about that part. um if you know
[14:23] obviously we know like Bitcoin is
[14:25] heading the way it is but it's annoying
[14:27] when these things kind of keep slowing
[14:28] adoption and they're completely
[14:29] incorrect and I I just wonder if you
[14:32] know it would be politicized in that way
[14:34] where you know who knows you know it's
[14:36] that's that's the only thing but uh it
[14:39] it it is annoying uh to to see that and
[14:42] I still get that energy and environment
[14:45] but uh around it I'm actually tomorrow
[14:48] on a on a a small Austrian podcast
[14:51] invite it uh because they uh a friend of
[14:55] mine is doing there and and they had
[14:57] some some fears around Bitcoin and they
[15:00] wanted me to explain it and they sent me
[15:01] a list of of things and like one f
[15:05] another so it will be really fun
[15:06] tomorrow to talk with them uh because
[15:08] they're non Bitcoiners and they have
[15:10] those questions um and I see outside of
[15:14] the Bitcoin world it's still in their
[15:16] head of like oh like it uses too much
[15:17] energy but even like even if if like it
[15:22] it's debunked and and stuff like that,
[15:23] but but people don't really read those
[15:26] things. Like people don't really
[15:28] research anything. They just see it and
[15:30] they're like, "Ah, okay. Uh uh Bitcoin
[15:33] uses too much energy." They read a
[15:35] headline and then this is their uh
[15:38] fault. It's not even their fault. Like
[15:40] most people actually operate that way.
[15:41] They they see something, they take it
[15:43] in, and if someone asks them about
[15:45] Bitcoin, that's the only thing they ever
[15:47] read about it. and they're like, "Okay,
[15:49] it uses too much energy." That's the
[15:50] only thing I know about Bitcoin. They
[15:52] So, so I never met someone that
[15:54] actually, and it's really interesting
[15:56] when you have someone that says like,
[15:57] "Oh, Bitcoin is using too much energy."
[15:59] If you ask them three questions, they
[16:01] don't know the answer to the fourth
[16:02] question because they don't really have
[16:04] done any research. So, it's I don't
[16:07] know. It's I don't know if it's a
[16:08] concern because I think long term um
[16:11] people will adopt Bitcoin uh if they
[16:13] want or not. I think most people will
[16:15] never understand Bitcoin, but I don't
[16:17] know if how you think about the mass
[16:19] adoption happening, but but I think it's
[16:22] probably like the TCPIP protocol where
[16:25] most people couldn't explain what it is,
[16:27] but everyone uses it every day. It
[16:29] probably will be a thing like that.
[16:31] Yeah. I mean almost an almost like
[16:33] similar to that like most people will
[16:35] hold Bitcoin but not realize that they
[16:37] really hold it. It'll be part of their
[16:38] 401k, right? they're not like getting
[16:40] their hardware wall throw it in, you
[16:42] know, getting their own private keys,
[16:43] stamping their seedwords into metal, you
[16:46] know, it's probably not for most people.
[16:47] Um, so, uh, yeah, passively owning it
[16:50] through an IRA, 401k, pension fund,
[16:53] something like that, or just, you know,
[16:55] trading it. And, um, you know, I think
[16:57] people like ultimately like they they
[16:59] don't have the time, right, to research
[17:00] most people, right? Most, like I was
[17:02] saying before, most people don't even
[17:03] read one book a year. Um, we're just too
[17:05] busy. everyone is fighting inflation and
[17:07] running on that hamster wheel and it's
[17:09] just getting harder and harder to to
[17:11] free up time to do things like um like
[17:15] research and study and improve upon
[17:17] life, right? And I think it's a lot
[17:19] easier for people to it's like in
[17:21] nature, right? You see something that
[17:22] you don't understand, the best thing to
[17:24] do is to kind of fear it in a way and,
[17:26] you know, kind of disregard it. It's
[17:27] it's easier to do that. So, I think when
[17:28] people hear these things, Bitcoin is bad
[17:31] for the environment. Okay, great. like I
[17:32] don't have time to even fight against
[17:34] that or understand it, but I hear these
[17:36] talking heads saying it. So, that's
[17:37] that's what I'm sticking with. It's just
[17:39] a fear of the unknown. It's like a
[17:41] natural reaction most people have. So,
[17:43] yeah, like um it's just interesting to
[17:46] see, right? And like you you find people
[17:47] that say they research Bitcoin or study
[17:50] it and then like you said, you find out
[17:51] they can't answer that fourth question.
[17:53] And it's like anyone that really has put
[17:54] the work in and study it, like they're
[17:55] they're Bitcoiners at this point. Like I
[17:57] haven't met anybody that was like I
[17:59] study Bitcoin for 100 hours and you know
[18:01] it's not for me. I don't get it. I'd
[18:02] rather be on the fiat standard. I mean
[18:05] they would have to get their head
[18:06] checked. It just doesn't make any sense.
[18:08] So you know it's it's I'm kind of in my
[18:11] own like Bitcoin world. I guess we see
[18:13] we talk to a lot of the same people,
[18:14] right? But um you step out and you just
[18:16] realize it's it's totally different out
[18:18] there. People just I think ultimately it
[18:20] comes down to people don't have time,
[18:22] right? It's part-time jobs, investing
[18:25] part-time, managing families. It's
[18:27] impossible for a while. Yeah.
[18:30] And we are also very early if if you
[18:33] think about the the progression of how
[18:35] many people actually have Bitcoin or use
[18:38] Bitcoin. How many people have uh like a
[18:40] steel plate? How many people people have
[18:43] a a hardware wallet? That number I think
[18:46] is shockingly shockingly small. Uh like
[18:50] how many people actually understand
[18:51] Bitcoin? It's it's it's actually an
[18:53] interesting question. What's your best
[18:55] guess of like how many people actually
[18:57] uh do understand Bitcoin? Um well I I do
[19:01] have like a little bit of data that just
[19:03] you know shared industry data between
[19:04] hardware wallet companies and seed
[19:06] storage companies like us where like if
[19:09] you look at crypto as a whole right and
[19:12] you know everything
[19:14] um which I think makes sense because a
[19:16] lot of people early in the phase think
[19:18] Bitcoin is crypto it's synonymous with
[19:20] that word I um they've kind of estimated
[19:24] um that like 10% of people that have
[19:26] crypto are in cold storage meaning they
[19:28] sent their private you know, they
[19:30] possessed their own private keys, they
[19:31] took it off the exchange, about 10% of
[19:33] people and then of that like another
[19:36] like tip is like about 1% of those
[19:37] people backed up their seedwords on
[19:39] metal. So, um, there's a lot of like
[19:42] resistance against fully understanding
[19:44] what it is. And people kind of go
[19:47] through their phases where, you know,
[19:48] first you're investing in stocks, day
[19:50] trading, and then you get into crypto,
[19:51] and then you you lose your money in
[19:53] crypto, and then you find out Bitcoin is
[19:55] what you want, and then you don't have
[19:58] enough Bitcoin to justify pulling it off
[20:00] the exchange and spending $200 on a
[20:01] hardware wallet and a few hundred on
[20:03] seed storage. So, then it sits there and
[20:05] then, you know, life gets ahead of you
[20:07] and you say, "I'll do it later. I'll do
[20:08] it another week. I'll do it another week
[20:10] and it just kind of like never happens.
[20:11] So it takes a while for people to get to
[20:13] that phase where they're like fully
[20:14] possessing Bitcoin owning it and like I
[20:17] you know if you're if you're so like I
[20:20] guess that's kind of like a like a cold
[20:21] storage metric I guess but for people
[20:23] that fully understand it I mean based on
[20:25] that it's got to be less than like
[20:28] 1% of the population right? Um you know
[20:33] I don't think that'd be crazy to think.
[20:34] What about you? It's it's I think 1% is
[20:37] way too high.
[20:39] [Music]
[20:40] optimist. Yeah. Because if you I don't
[20:43] know like let's say there's 500 million
[20:45] people in in in Bitcoin somehow. Uh
[20:48] let's say then 10% of them have a uh
[20:51] some sort of of hardware wallet that
[20:53] that's then 50 million. I think that is
[20:54] even like too too high of a number of of
[20:58] how many people actually understand
[20:59] Bitcoin. Uh and then there are like this
[21:02] is crypto people. So you probably have
[21:04] uh like who if someone really
[21:06] understands Bitcoin, they're not into
[21:09] crypto for for my liking at least. Uh so
[21:13] you you cut though uh that that number
[21:15] apart and you probably end up even like
[21:18] maybe under a million who would actually
[21:21] understand Bitcoin and fully uh to the
[21:25] degree that where they can talk about it
[21:27] and educate other people around it. uh
[21:29] and maybe a little bit higher if you it
[21:32] also depends on like what is
[21:33] understanding Bitcoin. If you have 50%
[21:35] of your net worth in Bitcoin but you
[21:37] couldn't explain why do you understand
[21:39] Bitcoin with your actions? Yes. But
[21:42] maybe not with your words. It's a it's a
[21:44] hard topic of like making a definition
[21:46] of like who understands Bitcoin or not.
[21:49] Right? A lot of people go like yeah I
[21:50] understand Bitcoin. I get it. It's like
[21:52] okay you just heard of it right? And uh
[21:54] there's so much to learn there. There's
[21:56] so many different fields of study. like
[21:58] you could study Bitcoin forever, you
[21:59] still don't understand it. You know that
[22:01] it's the best thing to do is never feel
[22:03] like you fully do, right? And um there's
[22:05] a lot of people who didn't study it that
[22:06] think they do, right?
[22:08] And it's low and it it feels like it's
[22:11] higher because we go to conferences, we
[22:13] go we go on podcasts, right? We're
[22:14] talking to people all day about Bitcoin.
[22:16] We're on X and it seems like it's bigger
[22:18] than it is, but I guess you're right.
[22:19] Like you step outside and no one knows
[22:21] about it. I was at dinner with uh when
[22:23] the Bitcoin reserve was announced um was
[22:25] it like last week on a week night? It
[22:27] was like right around dinner time for us
[22:28] here in the States and like I was
[22:30] looking at my phone like holy [ __ ] it
[22:32] happened. Like I couldn't believe it.
[22:33] You know how it is sometimes where you
[22:35] just like you go on X and like the
[22:36] craziest thing happened. You're like I I
[22:38] missed this. This is happened for like
[22:39] five minutes already. Everyone's talking
[22:41] about it. I'm like holy crap it's here.
[22:43] And then like I looked away from my
[22:44] phone and everyone's like what happened?
[22:45] Is is everything all right? Like I was
[22:47] like the strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[22:49] like no one even knew what I was saying.
[22:50] It was like I was speaking a different
[22:52] language. They're like the strategic
[22:54] what coin what's an executive order?
[22:55] like people no one knows anything it
[22:57] seems. Um so I'm just like guys like
[23:00] this means that and then like what you
[23:02] know right away the eyes glaze over and
[23:04] no one kind of gets it and then it's
[23:05] like okay well you know what's next? You
[23:08] know what are you eating? What what is
[23:09] that? Can you can you pass some of the
[23:10] fries over there? Like there's just no
[23:13] concern or care. It's really
[23:14] interesting. Um it's like the biggest
[23:16] deal in the world for us, right? And
[23:17] we're like oh if a strategic Bitcoin uh
[23:19] reserve gets announced it's going to be
[23:21] hard to buy Bitcoin under 100K. you
[23:22] know, get it while it's five digits
[23:24] before you can never get it while it's
[23:25] five digits again. And then it happens
[23:27] and it's just like, wow. Um, you know,
[23:31] it's not a big thing for most. It's it's
[23:32] kind of shocking to
[23:34] me. It's it's that fear of like
[23:38] understanding Bitcoin almost feels like
[23:41] insider
[23:43] trading. It's like almost we in a in a
[23:45] small group uh and and we know things
[23:48] will happen, but the rest of the world
[23:50] doesn't know. And now we're placing our
[23:52] bets even though it's all public
[23:54] information. Like there's there is no
[23:55] inside information in Bitcoin, but it
[23:58] feels like insider trading because it's
[24:00] uh it's a public secret. Uh and and when
[24:03] you go out and you're like they they
[24:05] don't know about it and they also don't
[24:08] care about it. It's it's fascinating.
[24:11] Yeah. And it's like okay, thank you. You
[24:13] know, more for me. It's it's
[24:15] interesting. But like I think that's
[24:17] where like the gradually then suddenly
[24:19] thing comes into play, right? Because
[24:21] the gradually is still happening. You
[24:22] know, it's happening slow and slow and
[24:24] so then one day all these, you know, uh
[24:26] script's going to flip. I I thought the
[24:28] reserve could do that, but it could be
[24:29] something else. Um yeah, gradually then
[24:32] suddenly. And it's uh it is interesting.
[24:35] I
[24:35] mean, we're so early. I feel that all
[24:38] the time. But it's like I I kind of I
[24:40] don't know if you feel like this, but I
[24:41] feel like I'm living in two worlds where
[24:43] when I'm at work and when I'm speaking
[24:44] with Bitcoiners, it's like that's one
[24:46] world and I step out and it's like clown
[24:48] world is still out there in full effect.
[24:49] And you're just like, wow. Like people
[24:51] are still thinking the way I was
[24:52] thinking 10 years ago. Like they haven't
[24:54] moved past that. Like they still trust,
[24:56] you know, uncovering Bitcoin and selling
[24:58] Bitcoin like you're you're red pilling
[25:00] yourself and orange pinning yourself at
[25:01] the same time or you probably red pill
[25:03] yourself already and you orange pled
[25:05] yourself after the fact. So it's there's
[25:07] like so much going on there that you're
[25:09] really like you said inside trading you
[25:11] understand what is going to happen next
[25:13] and you have a little bit of a feel on
[25:14] things but you also understand how the
[25:15] world works a little bit better and um
[25:18] kind of what fiat does and how USD is
[25:21] you know not affecting just the states
[25:23] but all the other countries that you
[25:24] know are using that as as money they're
[25:27] backing their currency with ultimately.
[25:29] Um, and it's you you kind of see behind
[25:32] the curtain and it's it's an interesting
[25:34] privilege, but and it it feels like it's
[25:36] like right there for everybody to learn,
[25:37] right? It's it's just there. It's this
[25:40] free thing that you could fully immerse
[25:41] yourself in, study, um, take any
[25:45] direction you want with Bitcoin. Um, it
[25:48] could be, you know, obviously, uh, money
[25:50] itself, food. I see a lot of people take
[25:52] that direction when they start to look
[25:53] at the food they're eating and start to
[25:55] reexamine why they're being served the
[25:58] food they are being served. How, you
[26:00] know, the the the CPI basket has been
[26:03] changed throughout the years because we
[26:05] can't keep up with the price of eggs and
[26:07] beef. So, they add, you know, hundreds
[26:08] of other products into the CPI basket to
[26:11] adjust the price. Things are subsidized
[26:12] with corn and soy. And you start to like
[26:14] you can take so many different paths
[26:15] with studying that field. And it's like
[26:18] right there for everybody. But the
[26:20] problem is ultimately what I think is
[26:23] well probably two things. It's it's
[26:24] time. Nobody has the time to do it um
[26:27] for the things we were talking about
[26:29] before. But then it's also um when
[26:32] people do have time masses, right? I I
[26:34] think there's distractions that get in
[26:36] the way, right? You have free time. I'm
[26:38] going to watch Netflix. I'm gonna go
[26:39] binge watch the series. Hey, did you see
[26:40] the new Squid Game series? Yeah, let's
[26:42] talk about that for the first two hours
[26:44] of work today and think about it and
[26:46] then watch it later tonight. like
[26:47] there's just so many other things that
[26:50] people are kind of chasing. Um you have
[26:52] consumerism too on top of that. You
[26:54] know, there's a there's that urge to
[26:56] purchase to fill a void or to um buy
[27:00] things before they become more expensive
[27:02] or or just to distract yourself. So I
[27:04] think that there's a lot especially in
[27:06] the states here there's a lot of things
[27:07] that distract the [ __ ] out of people.
[27:09] Um, and then like if you look, you go
[27:11] back in time, right, when none of this
[27:13] stuff existed, right? There was no
[27:14] electricity. Um, you know, funneling
[27:17] through your house to watch things like
[27:18] Netflix and do that. I I feel like
[27:20] people were smarter, right? They had
[27:21] more time to study and be introspective,
[27:23] think about the world around them, um,
[27:25] perfect a craft for their entire life
[27:27] because there were no things that got in
[27:29] the way. So like if you if you plug
[27:31] something like Bitcoin in into like a
[27:33] time like that, people would study it
[27:35] and fully understand it probably. But
[27:37] nowadays it's there's such there's so
[27:39] many shiny objects kind of waving in the
[27:41] way where it's
[27:42] like most people don't read anymore.
[27:45] It's really what it comes down to. Um
[27:47] and then you have like at least podcasts
[27:49] like that's great. I think that's a
[27:51] great way for people who don't have time
[27:53] who are commuting to listen to these
[27:55] things and study and whatnot, but then
[27:57] you look at how many podcasts there are
[27:59] and it's nearly impossible to ever find
[28:01] Bitcoin and break through. And then if
[28:02] you're in that discovery phase on
[28:04] YouTube trying to learn about this
[28:05] stuff, all the shitcoin scam videos tend
[28:08] to get like more action, more bot
[28:10] activity. So that's where people are
[28:12] going to go where they find the million
[28:13] view video, not where they find the
[28:15] 10,000 view high signal video. It's just
[28:18] less likely to happen. There's so many
[28:19] things kind of getting in their way. So,
[28:22] you know, there's just so many things.
[28:23] It's it's it's hard to focus on the one
[28:26] thing that um you know, I feel truly
[28:28] matters that no one's in control of that
[28:30] no one could change on you and rug you
[28:31] with. But um it it's it's tough, but
[28:34] it's kind of funny. It's like telling
[28:36] somebody that if you buy this and wait,
[28:39] you'll be rewarded and you all you have
[28:41] to do is literally buy and hold it and
[28:43] people just won't even kind of um fully
[28:46] listen to what you're saying. They're
[28:47] probably already thinking about what
[28:48] they're going to say next. A way to
[28:50] change the subject. Just most people
[28:52] don't care. Like I I think I have like
[28:53] one or probably like out of like my best
[28:56] friend group, you know, that core group
[28:57] of friends, I have like one that's
[28:58] interested in Bitcoin that wants to
[29:00] learn about it. I gave him a book to
[29:01] read everything. He still hasn't bought
[29:03] it yet. He's just waiting. It takes so
[29:04] long, man. You just got to make the jump
[29:06] and do it. Let's take a break for a
[29:08] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[29:10] Coin Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[29:13] watches. Those watches are the most
[29:16] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[29:19] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[29:22] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:25] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:28] watch collections. You have the date of
[29:31] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[29:34] there and of course also the block
[29:36] height and which epoch we are currently
[29:39] in. I love the level of detail they put
[29:42] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[29:45] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:47] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[29:50] love those watches so so much. And now
[29:53] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[29:56] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[29:58] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[30:00] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[30:02] first way is you put it on a hardware
[30:04] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[30:07] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[30:10] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[30:13] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[30:16] if you check out the link in the
[30:18] description, you even get 5% off if you
[30:21] use the code Robin. And the second way
[30:23] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[30:26] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[30:30] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[30:32] They will personalize for you a
[30:35] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[30:37] your individual situation. They will
[30:40] show you how you can secure your own
[30:43] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[30:45] enough. You also have to keep all your
[30:47] devices secure. One topic that is
[30:50] overlooked often is the inheritance
[30:52] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[30:55] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[30:57] a plan for that in place already? And
[31:00] last but not least, if you're in a
[31:02] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[31:04] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[31:07] that, head over to the
[31:11] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[31:13] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:16] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:19] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:21] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:24] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:26] you there. You can get your ticket in
[31:29] the link down in the description of
[31:31] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[31:33] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[31:37] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[31:38] there. It's it's fascinating um how I I
[31:43] love that topic of people are not
[31:45] focused, people are distracted. Um, and
[31:48] it's the fear system that that puts them
[31:51] into that uh hamster wheel of like I
[31:55] have to keep up with the invoices. I
[31:58] have to keep up with the bills that come
[31:59] in. I have to keep up with all all the
[32:01] things. And they don't have the time to
[32:04] step back and I don't know read a book
[32:06] on Sunday evening. Re like actually
[32:08] research a topic. Um, and and
[32:11] like and I see it actually in my
[32:14] audience. Most of my audience is like 45
[32:17] years old. Um because young people
[32:19] especially us now so distracted they
[32:21] they watch two hour Tik Toks
[32:25] uh but don't take the time to listen to
[32:27] 30 minutes of a podcast because they
[32:30] feel like they get more but two hours of
[32:32] Tik Toks you your brain is just fried
[32:34] afterwards. After 30 minute podcast you
[32:37] might actually get like one two nice uh
[32:39] nuggets out there. Might might actually
[32:40] get some learnings out there. Uh that's
[32:43] why I'm also unfortunately taking my
[32:47] shorts distribution, eclipse
[32:48] distribution not as serious. Um but I
[32:51] should take it more serious to to get
[32:53] that signal of Bitcoin also in that uh
[32:57] frameworks in there because maybe he
[32:59] sees that one short and he's like oh
[33:01] like bit seems interesting and then
[33:03] there's like one hour podcast he's like
[33:04] oh I saw that in short so like let let's
[33:07] dive deeper. So I think we Bitcoiners
[33:09] also have kind of a responsibility to
[33:12] try to get people into that that that
[33:16] thing and make make it as interesting as
[33:18] possible because I I think Bitcoin is
[33:22] for me a social revolution. So it does
[33:24] matter um how present we are in all
[33:28] those areas. So we need the podcasts, we
[33:30] need Tik Tockers that talk about
[33:32] Bitcoin, uh we we need uh on LinkedIn
[33:34] more people that talk about Bitcoin. And
[33:36] I think LinkedIn is a is a a hell place
[33:39] for fear. Um so we need more Bitcoiners
[33:42] also there. I think Nostra and Twitter
[33:44] we have enough there. It's like nostra
[33:47] and Twitter is is very nicely served
[33:49] with Bitcoiners. Um YouTube also has
[33:52] more and more Bitcoiners on there but it
[33:55] could be more. And I think Tik Tok,
[33:57] LinkedIn, and Instagram, those are like
[33:58] places online just where we we need way
[34:02] more um Bitcoiners to to pump content
[34:05] out there. And then in general
[34:06] population just like going out on the
[34:08] street and making uh people aware of of
[34:11] Bitcoin. And I met Bitcoiners who who
[34:14] love Bitcoin, but they never talk about
[34:16] Bitcoin in their families in in their
[34:18] wider circles. And and we need to kind
[34:21] of talk about it. we need to uh tell
[34:23] people about it to a certain degree to
[34:25] to make that social revolution more
[34:29] peaceful because uh we we the there's
[34:32] this time of the suddenly moment that we
[34:35] talked about and I think there is a
[34:37] chance that it's not peaceful and I
[34:40] think the more we talk about it the the
[34:42] more open and kind we are doing the
[34:45] orange pilling um the higher the chances
[34:48] that we actually have a peaceful
[34:50] revolution to to that point because I do
[34:52] think we come to a bitcoin world but I
[34:54] think it's not um fixed yet how we get
[34:58] there and I think we it does matter how
[35:01] we speak about bitcoin and and how we do
[35:02] the orange pilling for sure and yeah I
[35:06] mean all it makes sense to touch upon
[35:08] the platforms that there isn't a lot of
[35:10] signal and you know you have to get
[35:12] people in right and there's other low
[35:15] signal things on those platforms whether
[35:17] it be crypto in general or anything else
[35:20] really. Um that that kind of sucks
[35:22] people in especially on TikTok. So it's
[35:24] good to reshare things there and
[35:26] distribute it, but like um yeah,
[35:29] ultimately I mean it's not like a like
[35:32] no no bit I don't know if any Bitcoiners
[35:34] are like Tik Tok first, right? Like
[35:35] they're they're making videos for Tik
[35:37] Tok and then clipping it for shorts.
[35:38] Like it's usually, you know, the other
[35:40] ways around, but it almost just makes
[35:41] sense. Hey, copy this stuff and put it
[35:43] in these other places and see what it
[35:45] does, right? And it's good to be there
[35:48] for people for when they want to learn
[35:50] about it, right? And it's like we
[35:53] understand what Bitcoin is. It's almost
[35:54] like we were talking before like there's
[35:55] this thing that people could take and
[35:56] they don't. It's like I have a life raft
[35:58] and the the boat's sinking and you're
[36:00] not coming on the life raft, right? And
[36:01] if that was the case, you wouldn't even
[36:03] have to ask people. They would just run
[36:04] to it. Or you would scream, "Hey, get
[36:05] over here." But if if Bitcoin is scream,
[36:07] hey, get over here, do this, and we act
[36:09] like frantic, no one's going to listen,
[36:10] right? So it's kind of like very like,
[36:12] "Hey, here's the information. Do your
[36:14] own research." I I'm laying it out for
[36:16] you and it's up to you to kind of want
[36:18] to jump in and get it. And for some
[36:20] people that clicks right away. For some
[36:22] people it takes longer for that to
[36:23] click. Some people that will never kind
[36:25] of click and then they'll see other
[36:26] people embracing it and they'll just
[36:28] kind of follow what others are
[36:29] ultimately doing or just you know
[36:31] passively hold Bitcoin in their 401k
[36:33] over time. So um you know it's a certain
[36:36] approach that you know we take that's
[36:37] that's very important. Like I I I kind
[36:40] of move past the point of trying to like
[36:42] I don't want to say like beg people to
[36:43] buy Bitcoin, but it kind of feels that
[36:45] way from your own perspective. Like,
[36:47] hey, I I told you about it. If you have
[36:49] questions, ask me at this point. Read
[36:51] this book. Listen to this podcast. These
[36:53] are great foundations. And ask
[36:54] questions, right? That's that's kind of
[36:56] like the best thing we could do. And um
[36:58] it's the best way to learn. And I mean,
[37:00] ultimately, a lot of people also learn
[37:03] the hard way, right? They buy all these
[37:04] cryptos and altcoins and they lose it
[37:06] all. and then you know you some people
[37:08] might embrace Bitcoin from there and
[37:10] kind of study it from there um or some
[37:12] people might just kind of tap out alto
[37:13] together. So it's great that we have a
[37:15] lot of people in the space pushing out
[37:17] these videos and I feel like since like
[37:18] 2020 that that's ramped up incredibly
[37:21] like it's hard to kind of find podcasts
[37:23] in the day. Uh there were Bitcoin books
[37:25] but there weren't that many and now it's
[37:27] like impossible to kind of keep up with
[37:28] uh all this good content that's coming
[37:30] out. Yeah, it's it's uh it's out there
[37:33] for people. You know, you have a lot of
[37:35] great videos, right? everyone does.
[37:37] There's a lot of great books that are
[37:38] out there. Um, it's just like it's it's
[37:40] not on mainstream media enough yet and
[37:42] that's where it probably has to be
[37:43] eventually for people to fully
[37:45] understand it. Absolutely. Was for you
[37:48] Bitcoin the awakening point or was there
[37:50] something else that kind of red build
[37:52] you before that already? What uh red
[37:55] pilling? No, I'm thinking
[37:58] about Bitcoin usually is the point for
[38:01] people where they ask questions about
[38:03] things they never asked questions
[38:04] before. as you talked with like food and
[38:06] stuff like that and I'm wondering if
[38:09] Bitcoin was for you that moment or if
[38:11] there's something else that made you
[38:13] aware of things. No, I I think I red
[38:15] pill myself. I mean probably as young as
[38:18] 15 at like a first touch red pilling. Um
[38:21] where it was just like you initially
[38:22] tell yourself it's impossible the
[38:25] president to be running the country.
[38:26] Like that was something I always thought
[38:27] as a younger kid, right? Like one guy
[38:29] doesn't run it. There's a shadow group
[38:31] of people running it for him. there's
[38:33] people that run this world whether it be
[38:34] the Federal Reserve or people in media
[38:36] whatever it is like whatever being told
[38:38] is not the truth so that was like the
[38:39] initial kind of phase for me but I was
[38:41] just naturally someone that I guess
[38:44] contrarian mindset um distrust in
[38:47] authority um I didn't really trust my
[38:50] teachers I didn't trust friends parents
[38:53] I just I I understood that people were
[38:55] people and people make mistakes and like
[38:57] authority is just kind of like this fake
[38:59] sort of figure um that someone else is
[39:01] kind of behind controlling. So, it it
[39:05] was it's interesting like conspiracy
[39:07] theory videos. I went down all those
[39:09] rabbit holes, tried to learn as much as
[39:10] I could. Um it was just interesting to
[39:12] me like, you know, to to watch all these
[39:15] kind of YouTube videos and read a couple
[39:17] books about um who really kind of runs
[39:19] the country and, you know, there's names
[39:21] out there that we know that people have
[39:23] never heard about that they should know
[39:25] who these people are, right? So, it's
[39:27] it's kind of interesting that
[39:29] um that that's the case, right? So,
[39:32] being like redpilled early on kind of it
[39:36] there's people who get like redpilled
[39:38] when they learn about Bitcoin, like a
[39:39] red and orange at the same time. That's
[39:40] got to be the most profound thing ever.
[39:42] I didn't get that, but like what I did
[39:43] get was a solution to all the problems
[39:47] that I felt were unsolved. So, by red
[39:49] pilling yourself, it's it's almost
[39:51] scary. I had to step out a little bit
[39:53] because you kind of just it's not a good
[39:55] way to live. almost like uh you know,
[39:58] you kind of take the black belt path for
[39:59] a little bit like I got to tap out. This
[40:00] is just too much. I I'm not happy,
[40:03] right? There's no solution to this
[40:05] issue. I can't do anything about it. Um
[40:08] and then Bitcoin comes along and that
[40:10] really is the um it it kind of remedies
[40:13] all those feelings where there is a
[40:15] solution to all this, right? like we
[40:17] can't take arms like they did during the
[40:19] American Revolution and stand up for
[40:20] ourselves because of you know like
[40:23] taxation from abroad and you know
[40:25] whatever else may be but we can take
[40:28] Bitcoin and hold it in self- custody and
[40:29] that is like uh the peaceful Bitcoin
[40:32] revolution like that's how to take arms
[40:33] right like there's something I could do
[40:35] to fight against the system and then you
[40:38] start to see how powerful that system
[40:39] could be as a whole on a global level
[40:41] where everyone is sort of on the same
[40:43] standard and working towards a common
[40:45] goal and you're like this is how we
[40:47] fight it. And being
[40:50] redpilled, you know, 10, 15 years before
[40:52] I bought Bitcoin was a very interesting
[40:54] time where it's like, okay, we have all
[40:56] these issues now Bitcoin's here and it's
[40:58] a way to solve those problems. And I'm
[41:00] sure a lot of people, that's not unique.
[41:01] A lot of people have had that happen to
[41:03] them before. And I think that's why a
[41:04] lot of Bitcoiners are, you know,
[41:06] redpilled as well. Um, just because it's
[41:08] natural part of the process, but it it's
[41:11] um it makes you just feel a little bit
[41:14] more optimistic and hopeful. And I think
[41:16] that's really what it comes down to. Um
[41:18] rather than, you know, getting red pill
[41:21] and seeing kind of how the world really
[41:22] works to a certain degree and being
[41:24] upset, um nihilistic, now you have the
[41:27] opportunity to embrace Bitcoin and have
[41:31] hope for the future, think into the
[41:32] future, and uh just try to better
[41:34] humanity with that item. And you know,
[41:36] as we know, the best part about it is,
[41:39] you know, it's a great way to build the
[41:40] foundation for the future, too, because
[41:42] no one could is in full control. No one
[41:44] can rub you on that. Uh it's a it's a
[41:46] great thing to spend the time in to
[41:48] study because it it's it's got staying
[41:50] power. How do you look at the topic of
[41:52] self custody and and mass adoption of
[41:55] it? Um as we talk about Bitcoin is kind
[41:58] of awakening point for for people. Uh
[42:01] and I have two theories and I'm actually
[42:03] torn apart between those things. The one
[42:06] theory is like okay most people will
[42:08] never care about self custody at all.
[42:10] It's just always a smaller group of
[42:12] people. Um because most people like in
[42:15] the early days people thought of the
[42:17] early days of the internet people
[42:19] thought that um uh we we will run uh
[42:23] email service email servers all
[42:26] ourselves but now everyone uses Gmail.
[42:29] Um so when you think about uh the
[42:32] implications of self custody, do you
[42:35] think that will ever be a mass adoption
[42:38] uh where where people not only use
[42:41] Bitcoin but they actually do it
[42:42] themselves? They they they have the
[42:44] steel blade, they have some self custody
[42:46] set up. I think a lot of people are
[42:47] going to embrace it, right? If mass
[42:49] adoption means people are throwing their
[42:50] Bitcoin in harbor wallets and stamping
[42:52] their seeds in metal. Um I mean I
[42:55] certainly hope that second part, right?
[42:57] That's good for business. Now, all jokes
[42:58] aside, I don't know, man. Like, it's
[43:00] it's tough to think because I know
[43:02] people who have seven figures in Bitcoin
[43:05] and it's not on hardware wall. It's on
[43:07] the exchange still. There is a huge
[43:10] trust in institutions still that is hard
[43:12] for people to kind of break through and
[43:14] that maybe that's the people that aren't
[43:16] fully redpilled. Um, I think if you're
[43:18] not redpilled, you're probably on the
[43:19] exchange. If you have a sizable amount
[43:20] of Bitcoin, it's a good chance. Um, so
[43:23] it's tough to considering that people
[43:25] with millions of dollars aren't in cold
[43:26] storage yet. It's hard to think, right?
[43:28] Most people would take that step. It's
[43:30] it's a huge amount of responsibility to
[43:33] have, right? People feel that there's a
[43:35] technical um sort of hurdle that they
[43:37] have to climb over and it's really not
[43:39] that hard to destroy your seedwords. Uh
[43:42] it's it's extremely easy to do. These
[43:43] wallets are getting better and better
[43:45] and the user interface is getting better
[43:46] and there's full screens and color and
[43:48] full keypads. So, that's not that hard
[43:50] to do. The hard part is um
[43:52] procrastination is one thing, of course,
[43:54] and then the responsibility behind it.
[43:56] What if I lose this? I don't trust
[43:58] myself. I I trust the bank still, right?
[44:00] I I trust these institutions still. And
[44:02] it's like a hard thing for people to
[44:04] become fully red pill to distrust these
[44:06] things to be like, "No, I have to hold
[44:07] this." And what you see happen is kind
[44:09] of like, at least we're in the business,
[44:11] we see waves. So when the price of
[44:13] Bitcoin goes up substantially, like if
[44:15] it just, you know, little green candle
[44:17] hits, um, we see more sales. Um, if the
[44:21] California wildfires come, we see more
[44:23] sales. there's fear um behind what
[44:25] motivates people to get into cold
[44:27] storage, but those are people who
[44:29] already have Bitcoin, right? These
[44:31] aren't people who don't hold Bitcoin
[44:32] yet. So, ultimately, the first step is
[44:34] to get people to kind of hold Bitcoin,
[44:36] but like we were saying before, I think
[44:38] mass adoption kind of means most people
[44:39] are passively holding Bitcoin that
[44:41] aren't really realizing they are. You
[44:43] know, that said, I I there's no reason
[44:45] for them to stamp their seed and hold
[44:46] their keys, but who knows? Maybe there's
[44:49] like um like a collaborative self
[44:51] custody that that that's a growing
[44:53] market. You have a lot of high netw
[44:54] worth individuals going that route where
[44:56] there's a multi-IG setup. So rather than
[44:58] me having one wallet or a single
[45:01] signature, you know, you could do a two
[45:03] or three multi- signature where that
[45:04] institution holds a wallet with a
[45:06] private key. You have a private key and
[45:08] then another third party holds a private
[45:10] key, maybe a family attorney or another
[45:12] family member. Um, and then if one of
[45:15] those were lost, you would still have
[45:17] the other two, uh, to kind of back it
[45:19] up. Um, it's it's a nice way to, um, I
[45:23] guess diversify the storage of the seed
[45:26] words and, um, you know, kind of if one
[45:29] light goes out, the there's two other
[45:31] lights there to kind of send a
[45:33] transaction.
[45:34] Um, so I I think maybe that route would
[45:37] be more likely where it's uh where it's
[45:39] a multi-stick collaborative setup or you
[45:42] know an institution custoing bitcoin for
[45:43] somebody else and as like bitcoin price
[45:47] I don't I don't know for sure but I feel
[45:48] that is a bitcoin price goes up uh more
[45:50] people adopt it then the price kind of
[45:52] like flattens out a little bit so
[45:54] there's less of that um there's less
[45:56] risk in the price movement so maybe
[45:58] there's also less risk in holding it
[46:00] because it's more of a stable item
[46:03] um that you know people are okay with
[46:06] others custodying their coin whether it
[46:08] be a bank who banks can now custody
[46:10] Bitcoin um or collaborative setup um and
[46:13] then I think you'll also have people who
[46:15] do both right like okay it's part of my
[46:17] pension 401k or I'm doing a collab
[46:20] that's like my family inherits but I
[46:22] also have you know a single sig setup
[46:24] that I keep some on and that is like my
[46:26] my deep cold storage right these are
[46:28] coins that I'm like passing down to the
[46:30] next generation sort of deal so I I
[46:32] think like there's always a place for
[46:34] single SIG and stamping your seedwords
[46:36] into a plate like that that's always
[46:38] going to be a thing that exists. Um, but
[46:41] I feel like as you know for mass
[46:44] adoption there's going to be technology
[46:46] that supports probably like there
[46:48] wouldn't be a need to really do it
[46:50] right. And I I think like as Bitcoin um
[46:53] becomes less of a thing you have to
[46:55] study to fully understand, more of a
[46:57] thing that kind of just gets dumped on
[46:58] the masses. We're like, "Hey, this makes
[47:00] sense to hold. Everyone else has it or
[47:01] it's in my 401k." um there's just less
[47:04] research there to understanding why you
[47:05] have to store your seedwords and what it
[47:07] really means. Um so it's it's kind of
[47:10] like a unique thing um probably to
[47:12] bitcoiners too even um like a lot of
[47:16] altcoins NFTs it's all hot wallet driven
[47:18] like these guys are like tapped into the
[47:20] internet with hot wallets and they're
[47:21] buying selling they're not really you
[47:23] looking to hold for the next 30 years
[47:25] like we are with Bitcoin. So to me,
[47:27] there's always a place, right, for for a
[47:29] single SIG, whether it's, you know, a
[47:31] plate hidden at your house or you lost
[47:33] your wallet at the bottom of the ocean,
[47:35] there's always going to be that. So, um,
[47:38] so I don't know. I certainly hope so,
[47:40] but like I said before, man, you it's
[47:43] it's tough. It really is tough to get
[47:45] people even in Bitcoin and crypto to
[47:47] even go into gold storage in the first
[47:49] place right now. I'm also wondering
[47:50] sometimes if because Bitcoin is so
[47:53] unique and actually incentivizes to you
[47:56] to to hold your own keys to make your
[47:59] own note maybe running your own node and
[48:01] stuff like that if Bitcoin might be what
[48:06] I don't know the printing press did for
[48:08] society what what electricity did for
[48:10] society and Bitcoin is not only doing
[48:13] the financial revolution but also an a
[48:17] social revolution where self-
[48:19] responsibility and the low time
[48:21] preference um is is getting
[48:23] mainstreaming in and getting ushered in
[48:26] and it it kind of has like an golden age
[48:30] uh of of self- responsibility, but maybe
[48:33] that's just streaming from a Bitcoiner
[48:34] perspective. Uh I don't know. Yeah, I
[48:37] mean it it's certainly I do see a future
[48:41] where that happens, but I part of me
[48:44] feels like it gets worse before it gets
[48:45] better for for a lot of those people.
[48:47] Um, but yeah, I mean it's it's a tough
[48:51] thing. Most people just don't want the
[48:52] responsibility of it. Um, I could see
[48:55] that being a thing. It's you have to be
[48:56] extremely responsible to to do self-
[48:58] custody properly. Um, and I, you know,
[49:02] it's going to be tough for a lot of
[49:03] people just to kind of do that in
[49:05] general. Um, but yeah, as far as like
[49:07] self- responsibility goes, that's that
[49:10] that'll be a huge thing, right? that
[49:11] that kind of changes society in general
[49:14] that you're less reliant on the
[49:16] government, less reliant on mommy and
[49:18] daddy, less reliant on when the media is
[49:20] saying, and you're kind of self-reliant,
[49:22] and you're really focused on the
[49:24] community around you and the people that
[49:25] are actively in your life. I think, you
[49:27] know, that's that is golden age right
[49:28] there because you're just you could, you
[49:30] know, social media, right? People are on
[49:33] social media and it's mostly like for
[49:35] the most part negative, right? Anything
[49:37] that's on social is negative. If you go
[49:38] on Facebook and you look at a post and
[49:40] you're like, "Wow, this post went viral
[49:42] and you read the comments, it's because
[49:43] like someone's talking [ __ ] about
[49:45] something someone's wearing in the video
[49:46] or something they said or a typo that
[49:49] they typed or something they misaid."
[49:51] Whereas when you step out into your like
[49:53] local community, there's a lot less of
[49:54] that. People are mostly nice and helping
[49:56] each other. And um you know, you want
[49:59] the world around you to be I guess you
[50:02] know, every everyone's got to you know,
[50:04] it's got to be everyone's got to coexist
[50:05] and and you know, I think there's like
[50:08] self-respons responsibility like
[50:10] naturally built into that because you
[50:12] know, you're out front with these
[50:13] people, living with them, you know, kind
[50:14] of like don't [ __ ] where you eat sort of
[50:16] deal, but um it it's still to me there's
[50:19] like a technical gap that I think it's
[50:21] hard to overcome with people with
[50:23] self-custody. But um who knows? Walts do
[50:26] get better. Um, the technology from when
[50:28] wallets first came out or is is insane.
[50:31] Like I was kind of I I I I collect. So I
[50:34] have a lot of old hardware wallets that
[50:36] I just have. It's it's fun thing to
[50:38] have. And then you look at the new ones
[50:40] and they're almost looking like cell
[50:41] phones now. So um obviously wouldn't be
[50:44] airgapped, but maybe a cell phone that
[50:46] is also like a hybrid hardware wallet
[50:49] cell phone. I could see that being a way
[50:51] that people sort of have cold storage um
[50:54] or or possess their own bitcoin and you
[50:56] know think about everyone has a phone in
[50:58] their pocket for the most part so
[50:59] everyone's like naturally tapped in so I
[51:02] see into the future where hardware
[51:03] wallets become integrated with cell
[51:04] phones and some of them are actually
[51:06] starting to look like cell phones um
[51:08] that are out there like they really or
[51:10] calculators so it's kind of evolving to
[51:12] the point where maybe it's a
[51:13] multi-device um and then you have like
[51:16] um a wallet I don't like but I could see
[51:19] it being great for masses for easy
[51:21] yucking up as like a bit key uh the Jack
[51:24] um Jack Dorsey's wallet. Um it's an
[51:26] interesting setup. Look into it if you
[51:28] know anyone hasn't heard it. But that
[51:30] does make it a little bit easier for
[51:31] people. So I think tech like that, you
[51:34] know, does help, right? To expect most
[51:37] people to like get a seed signer and
[51:39] scan QR codes and and do things like
[51:41] that like that's never going to happen.
[51:42] It's got to be like like this, right?
[51:44] There's no buttons on this. It's it's
[51:46] easy to use. like it's people could pick
[51:48] it up whether it's a child or or an
[51:50] older person and use it. So unless a
[51:53] harbor wallet is like that um I don't
[51:55] think so like so if it becomes
[51:57] integrated in the cell
[51:59] phone yeah I could see most people doing
[52:01] it. I also wonder what the future in
[52:05] general will be with with keyh holding
[52:08] and and accessing uh systems in general.
[52:11] Uh and when you look in the IT security
[52:13] crowd, they are going more and more away
[52:16] from that like password, username kind
[52:18] of a type and the more like two factors
[52:21] anyway is um uh important but u I have
[52:25] some some IT security friends and they
[52:27] all have the the sticks the how do you
[52:30] call the UI key. Exactly. Yeah. Uh and
[52:33] and they log in with that. So maybe we
[52:35] just we come in a in a future where key
[52:39] management and and and like having keys
[52:42] to enter
[52:43] something in the digital world is just
[52:46] becoming way more normal and then maybe
[52:49] also with Bitcoin it becomes normal. I
[52:52] don't know like like think about uh
[52:54] Apple uh because they have they they
[52:58] always rise security and privacy in in
[53:00] their marketing things. Maybe they come
[53:03] up with like an Apple key where you can
[53:05] store actually uh local keys and you can
[53:08] actually enter things that that could
[53:10] actually be um uh maybe not the optimal
[53:14] for the sovereign guys, but better than
[53:17] uh having it on exchange where you can
[53:20] transact with your Bitcoin if you have
[53:21] like your phone and you point it with
[53:23] your Apple key somewhere and or you have
[53:26] like a multi signature where when you
[53:28] have your laptop, your Apple Watch and
[53:30] your your phone and and you have them in
[53:32] one location, you tap on all three of
[53:34] them at the same time and then you're
[53:36] sending a transaction. So I think uh
[53:39] there's a lot to come I think uh of of
[53:41] innovation uh and there there will be a
[53:45] full spectrum of like hardcore bitcoiner
[53:49] who have it not even in collaborative
[53:52] custody they have their uh full selfs
[53:55] sovereign setup with steel blades and
[53:57] everything like that where there's
[53:59] nobody else involved up until ETFs and
[54:02] exchanges and everything in between with
[54:05] like yeah as we mentioned a bit key or
[54:07] like Apple keys or like whatever like
[54:09] what happens if Apple and Samsung is now
[54:12] discovering Bitcoin and they want to not
[54:15] only put it on the balance sheet but
[54:16] also want to profit from a product
[54:18] around that. That's a really interesting
[54:20] thought. I think that's also might
[54:22] happen and we we probably don't have a
[54:24] clue what how self custody looks in 10
[54:27] years for the mass adoption I'm
[54:30] thinking. Yeah. Um, no, it was
[54:33] interesting with UB Keys and 2FA, which
[54:35] is becoming part of everything. People
[54:38] are going through the motions where
[54:39] they're getting used to having to pull
[54:40] out their phone to verify a code.
[54:43] There's so much scams that are
[54:45] happening. Like, I don't even open most
[54:46] emails anymore. Everything is basically
[54:48] a scam. Like, unless you call me or send
[54:50] a letter in the mail, like I really, you
[54:52] know, it's not that important. Like,
[54:53] right, you know, that bill isn't that
[54:54] important unless you're mailing it to me
[54:56] or calling me. So, there's there's a lot
[54:59] of scams out there. So like people going
[55:00] through those motions and getting used
[55:01] to, hey, this is a new way of life. I
[55:03] have to do this to make sure this
[55:04] doesn't get hacked and that I'm logging
[55:06] into the right software at work that
[55:09] can't get compromised by people who are
[55:11] trying to find out what my company's
[55:12] doing or or whatever. Um that that's
[55:16] like an interesting like um stepping
[55:18] stone, right? They're they're going
[55:20] through those phases of confirming
[55:22] things with different devices. So, uh,
[55:25] if that becomes more of a thing, which
[55:27] with all these scams that are happening,
[55:28] it's it it's likely that that eases the,
[55:31] um, you kind of break through that surf
[55:33] of going into cold storage, it just
[55:34] becomes, oh, okay, that makes sense to
[55:36] do this, right? Like, why wouldn't I do
[55:37] this with my Bitcoin? Of course, I
[55:38] should, you know, have extra measures
[55:40] that are protecting it in place. Um, so
[55:43] yeah, and but then like also like as as
[55:46] time goes on and banks could custody
[55:48] Bitcoin and and there's less like dicey
[55:51] CD exchanges out there which you know
[55:53] we're getting to that phase even though
[55:56] I bit was hacked um a tremendous amount
[55:59] um which was converted to Bitcoin
[56:02] ultimately um but you know as those
[56:04] things don't happen as much there might
[56:06] be less fear right um so if there's no
[56:09] risk um people might feel safe with an
[56:12] institution holding it for them, they
[56:14] might not feel that there is risk,
[56:15] right? Same people that feel there's no
[56:17] risk um holding dollars, right, that
[56:20] don't even understand what fractional
[56:21] reserve banking is, probably would feel
[56:23] no risk of a bank who says, "Hey, we
[56:25] custody Bitcoin, we ensure it for this
[56:27] much, you know, we'll hold it for you."
[56:28] That could be a thing. So, it's really
[56:30] like um I think it ultimately like if
[56:32] you think like hundreds of years into
[56:34] the future, who knows? And who really
[56:37] knows? like an event happens and
[56:38] everyone gets hacked or the systems go
[56:39] down all of a sudden these things change
[56:41] overnight. So it's hard to guess, man.
[56:44] It's hard to
[56:46] guess. Absolutely. I just hope that as
[56:49] many people as possible on the
[56:51] sovereignty side and not on the exchange
[56:53] sides because uh freedom go up
[56:55] technology is the foundation for number
[56:59] technology. I think the the one enable
[57:01] starter one. Uh and and so I I sometimes
[57:06] see um a threat in people are extremely
[57:11] on like oh strategic Bitcoin reserve of
[57:13] ETFs and and just think of like how can
[57:16] the Bitcoin number go up uh and the
[57:18] price go up and don't care about the the
[57:21] the price. I don't care about the the
[57:24] freedom grab technology which which is
[57:26] kind of yeah might be a a bad thing but
[57:31] at
[57:34] le and and that's that's in the end of
[57:37] the end of the day the the real thing
[57:40] for for Bitcoin. It's it's
[57:41] permissionless. It's for everyone. So
[57:43] also people can choose if they trust
[57:46] custodians or not. I just hope we can
[57:48] bend a little bit towards self-
[57:50] sovereignty and and self custody. Yeah.
[57:53] What forms of rehypothecation will
[57:55] exist, right? When banks custody
[57:56] Bitcoin, that's that's a fear, right? 21
[57:59] million is something, right? That that
[58:01] that number only goes down over time. Um
[58:04] right, it only has gone down over time.
[58:05] I think there's only like actually 19
[58:07] million Bitcoin that are accessible. Um
[58:10] most is min. So it's highly scarce. So
[58:12] if banks custody it and rehypothecated
[58:14] and then give out loans against it, it's
[58:17] almost like this world that we're
[58:19] stepping out of that we could step right
[58:20] back into again. So, it's a little
[58:22] scary, but at the end of the day,
[58:23] holding real Bitcoin and cold storage uh
[58:25] it's a superpower. Gives you a totally
[58:27] different feel as you're walking about
[58:29] life and going through different uh
[58:31] issues. You know, you kind of have that
[58:33] um with you. It's it's like walking to a
[58:36] bad neighborhood with a loaded gun,
[58:38] right? You feel different about it. So,
[58:40] having Bitcoin full storage is, you
[58:41] know, it's a life hack to me. So, um I
[58:44] I'll keep doing that for as long as I'm
[58:46] alive. And um you know the next
[58:48] generation that I raise will do the same
[58:50] thing. Absolutely 100% agree. Um we have
[58:54] one question that I ask each and every
[58:55] one of my guests and the question is uh
[58:57] what can we learn from you besides
[58:59] Bitcoin? Um besides Bitcoin man I don't
[59:02] know my life is like becoming so
[59:04] intertwined with it. It's it's hard to
[59:06] to think about that but I don't really
[59:08] have
[59:10] um any like wise sage advice to to
[59:13] really offer. It's um it's really all
[59:15] Bitcoin focused for me. Like that's kind
[59:17] of like where my life is. I mean um
[59:20] everything everything kind of leads back
[59:22] to it, right? Everything intertwines
[59:24] with it. Like keeping your body healthy,
[59:26] eating the right food, like it's all
[59:28] like Bitcoin has motivated that like
[59:30] beyond belief. So
[59:31] like I don't know, man. Hold your
[59:34] Bitcoin in cold storage. Stamp your
[59:36] seedwords into titanium like these
[59:38] plates right here. That's great advice.
[59:41] Find a great spot to hide it. um eat the
[59:44] right foods. You know that, you know, um
[59:47] you can't trust what any any institution
[59:49] is saying, right? Just because somebody
[59:51] behind a camera that's like a really
[59:53] nice fancy camera that's on TV and it's,
[59:56] you know, mainstream, like it does not
[59:57] mean it's true at all whatsoever. If you
[60:00] look back in history, governments have
[60:02] lied to people. Um foods have been
[60:05] poisoned and they've been altered and
[60:07] they're still poisoned today.
[60:09] um you just look look at what history
[60:11] has told you and realize that like what
[60:13] you're being fed through mainstream
[60:14] media, through social media, you know,
[60:17] big talking head accounts is is mostly
[60:20] meant to distract you from what is
[60:22] really happening in the world and also
[60:24] meant to make you weaker, more docile,
[60:26] uh less independent. So, question
[60:29] everything. It's really the best advice
[60:31] I could give. Do your own research on
[60:33] everything.
[60:34] Bitcoin, food, medicine. I I mean, I
[60:39] don't want to say be your own doctor,
[60:40] but do your own research with
[60:41] everything, man. Like, you have to you
[60:43] have to question everything. It's too
[60:44] many people are passive and they're just
[60:47] happy with listening to other people
[60:48] say. And like I hope I don't offend
[60:50] anyone, but it's kind of like um I
[60:52] always like look at this segment of
[60:53] people as people who never got out of
[60:56] school mentality, right? Like these are
[60:58] like they're still living life as if
[61:00] they're in grade school. The teacher is
[61:01] in charge, their principal's in charge,
[61:03] he knows more than us. like they they
[61:05] they put so much faith in authorities,
[61:07] institutions that are kind of like
[61:08] ruling them. And I think it's like a
[61:09] sense of safety maybe, but um it's
[61:12] almost like they just never got out of
[61:14] school, right? Like get out of school,
[61:16] do your own thing, um find your own
[61:19] field to study and um you know, don't
[61:24] trust verify in every aspect of life. I
[61:26] love that. I think that's it's so
[61:28] important for people to to wake up and
[61:30] and and do exactly the like like the
[61:34] question more things like if you just
[61:37] start and like okay but why is that like
[61:40] that uh and there's a fine line between
[61:43] being paranoid and and having and and
[61:47] and still living a normal life. uh but
[61:50] uh I think most people are too much on
[61:53] the side of just accepting things as
[61:56] they enter their brain and not
[61:58] questioning enough. Uh so if we if we
[62:01] get a little bit more on the paranoid
[62:02] side, I think it's it's it's a healthy
[62:04] thing for for for for society if that
[62:08] makes sense. And it's like the the fear
[62:10] thing kicks in for for people who don't
[62:12] know something. It's fear of the
[62:13] unknown. It's like a natural knee-jerk
[62:15] reaction. I don't like this. So, I'm
[62:16] going to be fearful against it and find
[62:18] something that's bad about it to shoot
[62:20] it all down. And I I think that's what
[62:22] um you know, a lot of people are kind of
[62:24] like obviously fighting against.
[62:27] Um and it it's just a matter of kind of
[62:29] breaking through that. So, you know, the
[62:32] fear of the unknown is something that
[62:34] could really um detract detract your
[62:37] entire life, right? And I I would
[62:39] ultimately say like be a critical
[62:42] thinker about like everything. Um, and
[62:43] don't let anyone say critical thinking
[62:46] is conspiracy theory because that's just
[62:48] a fear reaction and that's like um a
[62:51] copout answer to most things. Um, most
[62:54] conspiracy theories that I've had have
[62:55] come true. Like the record is pretty
[62:57] good on those. It's just a matter of
[62:58] like lowering your time preference to
[63:00] wait for the truth to come out. But I
[63:02] I'm like critical thinking is critical
[63:05] thinking. It's not like being a
[63:06] conspiracy theorist at all. Right. And I
[63:08] think that that is like a tool that's
[63:10] used by um the elite for other people
[63:14] who are more like parrots to regurgitate
[63:16] when they hear something that doesn't
[63:18] coincide with um their safety that they
[63:22] feel by listening to these um mainstream
[63:25] media or politicians or people in
[63:27] authority. It's kind of like a fear and
[63:30] they don't even know why they're saying
[63:31] it and they won't even bother to
[63:32] research what it is. So be a critical
[63:35] thinker. Yeah, that's my advice.
[63:39] I love that. Really cool. Um, we have an
[63:41] entity in the podcast where the previous
[63:43] guest is asking a question for the next
[63:44] guest without knowing who the next guest
[63:46] actually is. And the previous guest
[63:48] asked you the question, when will we
[63:50] reach 1 billion Bitcoin users? 1 billion
[63:53] Bitcoin users. Wow. Um, it's got I mean
[63:57] one billion. Let me let me think.
[64:00] Bitcoin users meaning they hold Bitcoin
[64:02] on the exchange or they have it in self-
[64:04] custody. That's a tough That's a That's
[64:06] a difficult question like what what
[64:08] qualifies as a Bitcoin users. But I
[64:10] guess uh someone that has exposure to
[64:12] Bitcoin even even if it's because I
[64:15] think if we exclude the ones that have
[64:18] it on exchange uh it it takes a way
[64:20] longer time. I I don't know. I mean
[64:23] within the next 15 years. That's that's
[64:26] the best guess I can
[64:27] give. Yeah. Absolutely. Really cool. Um
[64:31] thank you so much uh James for being on.
[64:33] Before I let you go, where can people
[64:35] find uh where can people find you and
[64:37] reach out to you? Um yeah, find me on X
[64:40] uh hammer seed21 and then um you can
[64:44] find stamp seed on X2 uh stamp seed. Um
[64:48] and yeah, we have
[64:50] Bitcoin self-custody solution. You can
[64:52] stamp your seedwords into a titanium
[64:54] plate completely DIY. If you guys have
[64:56] questions, feel free to reach out and
[64:58] ask. Um yeah. Um yeah. Do you do I have
[65:03] to ask a question for the next guest as
[65:05] well? I just realized. Uh yes, but uh I
[65:08] usually take that question offline, but
[65:10] if you already have one, you you can
[65:12] give it to me now. No, I don't have one
[65:13] right now. I'll get back to you. Let me
[65:15] think of it. Really cool. Thank you so
[65:17] much, uh James, for being on. Also,
[65:19] thank you so much for everyone that is
[65:20] watching and listening for joining us
[65:22] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[65:24] with another episode. Bye-bye.
