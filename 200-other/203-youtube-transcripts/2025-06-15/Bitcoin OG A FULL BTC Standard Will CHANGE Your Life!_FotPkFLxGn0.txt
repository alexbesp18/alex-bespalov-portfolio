[00:00] I get paid in Bitcoin I only hold
[00:02] Bitcoin as essentially the money that I
[00:04] hold and I preferentially spend Bitcoin
[00:07] directly to me Fiat is a medium of
[00:09] exchange but Bitcoin is my money I came
[00:11] to the conclusion simply holding Fiat
[00:13] makes no sense so I stopped doing it I
[00:15] do now tend to stop and think more is
[00:18] this something I actually want to buy
[00:19] when I know that money is going to be
[00:21] worth more in the future the passion for
[00:23] learning got crushed out of them by this
[00:25] education system and I want to reins
[00:27] that in them and I don't think I can do
[00:29] that while they are at a German School
[00:31] the best way to get rid of
[00:32] authoritarianism is to make it obsolete
[00:34] make it unimportant make it not capable
[00:37] get rid of its teeth Bitcoin does that
[00:38] with money I think countries should have
[00:41] strategic Bitcoin reserves and actually
[00:43] I'm going to say no I actually don't
[00:44] think they should because I don't like
[00:46] countries and I want countries to
[00:47] disappear I think countries are a bad
[00:49] idea I think humans can organize
[00:51] themselves much better without having
[00:53] states without having borders
[00:55] artificially drawn by centralized Powers
[00:57] I expect for this coming year 2 is to
[01:00] see a lot more Merchant
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] adoption you also live already on
[01:09] bitcoin and with living on bitcoin
[01:11] there's different different definitions
[01:14] with that like to what extent we live on
[01:16] bitcoin uh how do you live right now on
[01:20] bitcoin like what is your definition of
[01:21] living in Bitcoin on bitcoin yeah so I
[01:25] would never be so presumptuous as to
[01:27] tell other people what is and is not
[01:30] living on bitcoin so I can say how I can
[01:32] say what I do and that's what I call it
[01:34] but you know if somebody else does
[01:36] something different and also calls it
[01:37] living on bitcoin then that's their you
[01:39] know their choice so what I do um is I
[01:42] get paid in Bitcoin um I only hold
[01:46] Bitcoin as um uh essentially the money
[01:49] that I hold um and I preferentially
[01:52] spend Bitcoin directly wherever possible
[01:55] um there are some things that I'm not
[01:58] able to pay in Bitcoin directly uh so I
[02:01] also have some indirect methods um of
[02:03] using Bitcoin um one for example is a
[02:06] credit card that I can pay off using
[02:08] Bitcoin so essentially I go into feat
[02:09] debt and then uh you know pay off that
[02:11] debt using Bitcoin um or another couple
[02:14] of cases are actually you know I do have
[02:16] a bank account it sits on zero most of
[02:18] the time but I will buy Fiat um in order
[02:20] to make a transaction if that's you the
[02:23] only way that I can make a payment so
[02:25] you know uh paying my water bill to the
[02:27] local Council for example uh you know
[02:29] there's way other than a bank transfer
[02:31] so that's what I'll do um so to me Fiat
[02:34] is a medium of exchange but Bitcoin is
[02:37] my money so you always get ahead and and
[02:41] sell uh Bitcoin if you need feat or you
[02:44] directly spend your Bitcoin you don't do
[02:46] anything with borrowing against your
[02:48] Bitcoin or anything fancy like that no
[02:51] I'm um so my background is largely
[02:55] Technical and actually I've always been
[02:57] somewhat skeptical of the finance space
[03:00] in general and somewhat disinterested in
[03:02] it um I think uh you know money is a
[03:06] useful necessary tool for organizing our
[03:09] world and uh exchanging value but I've
[03:12] never been interested in getting rich
[03:14] I've never been interested in trying to
[03:16] optimize the way that I use money that
[03:19] kind of thing um so things like
[03:21] borrowing against my Bitcoin to me just
[03:23] feels like the same kind of Finance
[03:25] games as investing in things and it
[03:27] really doesn't interest me um so you
[03:31] know to me it's just easier um I noticed
[03:33] by the way you said sell some Bitcoin I
[03:35] actually I I never think in those terms
[03:37] um to me that's buying theat because
[03:39] Bitcoin is my money so to me the terms
[03:42] buy and sell are kind of the other way
[03:43] around than perhaps uh most people yeah
[03:46] that that's a good that's a good point
[03:48] for for how long are you doing that now
[03:51] so since around
[03:53] 2018 um perhaps 2017
[03:56] 2017 is when I really decided this makes
[04:00] sense to do um I actually kind of had a
[04:02] revelation at that point because for a
[04:04] couple of years I've been doing uh spend
[04:06] and replace the idea you know that very
[04:08] common um idea that you will hold some
[04:11] Bitcoin and you want to stimulate the
[04:12] Bitcoin ecosystem so you'll spend it and
[04:14] then you'll buy some more Bitcoin from
[04:17] the Fiat Holdings that you have and I
[04:19] thought to myself why am I doing this um
[04:22] if I've got um Fiat and Bitcoin then and
[04:27] I'm planning on using that Fiat to buy
[04:28] Bitcoin at some point point in the
[04:30] future why don't I just do that
[04:32] immediately doesn't it make more sense
[04:34] to just not hold the Fiat um and at the
[04:38] same time I kind of had the Revelation
[04:41] um all these people saying things like
[04:42] you oh you'll regret spending Bitcoin
[04:44] because it's going to be worth so much
[04:46] more five years from now and I realized
[04:50] it's actually the exact same thing
[04:52] holding Fiat in your bank account if you
[04:55] have um you know $1,000 Euro Franks
[04:58] whatever um currency in your bank
[05:01] account and you don't exchange it for
[05:03] Bitcoin you've actually suffered the
[05:05] exact same opportunity cost holding that
[05:08] theat um that you would have suffered by
[05:10] spending that amount of Bitcoin on
[05:12] something um You've Lost That potential
[05:15] Bitcoin in the future so I kind of came
[05:19] to the conclusion simply um holding fat
[05:21] makes no sense so I stopped doing
[05:24] it that makes a lot of sense do you uh
[05:27] do you live somewhere where you have to
[05:29] pay capital gains tax on the Bitcoin so
[05:33] right now yes and no but um effectively
[05:36] no uh I live in Germany and uh here
[05:39] anything um any asset such as Bitcoin
[05:42] held for over one year is uh exempt from
[05:45] capital gains tax and I have enough
[05:48] Holdings for long enough now that uh
[05:51] essentially all of the Bitcoin I have is
[05:54] either over a year old or will be by the
[05:56] time I spend it because the the Bitcoin
[05:59] that come new in the wallet is kind of
[06:02] end in the in the queue and you spend
[06:04] first uh the Bitcoin that are already
[06:07] older in in the in the wallet and
[06:09] therefore they're already older yeah
[06:11] that makes a lot of sense then the then
[06:13] the um uh then it gets also easier I
[06:19] guess to to make that would you still do
[06:21] it if you have I don't know 20 10 30% of
[06:24] capital gains tax on that um probably
[06:28] not but
[06:30] maybe this is one of those cases where
[06:32] I'd say maybe I probably still would but
[06:35] uh I just wouldn't tell the tax office
[06:36] about it um that's it's one of those uh
[06:39] one of those kind of situations there
[06:41] but it it really depends on what the uh
[06:43] you what the tax situation looks like
[06:45] and so on um it probably helps a lot now
[06:48] that I'm paid directly in Bitcoin so
[06:49] when I started doing this I was still
[06:51] paid in Fiat and I would simply exchange
[06:54] all of my Fe it for Bitcoin um and then
[06:56] you know be living on bitcoin as I am
[06:58] now but now I can simply skip that step
[07:01] because I'm paid in Bitcoin
[07:03] directly it's super interesting it's I
[07:05] never thought about paying things in in
[07:07] Bitcoin this year but it occurred to me
[07:10] that uh why should I not do it because
[07:13] now actually the majority of my income
[07:16] not all of that but the majority of the
[07:18] income is already in Bitcoin now um
[07:21] obviously I get for example YouTube ad
[07:23] Revenue I cannot change that to to
[07:25] bitcoin uh I get from my merch store
[07:29] that is disconnect with with YouTube I
[07:32] cannot change that in Bitcoin uh that's
[07:34] like bigger fights to fight uh but uh
[07:38] sponsorships and other things the
[07:39] majority of the income is already in
[07:42] Bitcoin and now I get to the um luxury
[07:46] problem of uh I have to spend my Bitcoin
[07:49] uh in order to pay my bills slowly
[07:51] slowly this year actually I could uh uh
[07:54] pay my bills with the Fiat that coming
[07:56] in so I was like I just used those Fe
[07:59] they come in and directly spend it in um
[08:02] in in Fiat again uh but uh next year it
[08:06] will be definitely something different
[08:09] uh but there's those weird rules in
[08:11] austa where you actually have to pay
[08:12] capital gains tax I mean I still have
[08:14] some some Bitcoin bought before that tax
[08:17] rule so those are taxfree actually
[08:19] because the rule was also in in Austria
[08:21] but that is something that I'm really
[08:23] curious for next year and I have to
[08:25] research more how I actually then go
[08:27] ahead and do it also just with the
[08:30] documentation like I I'm like someone
[08:32] that wants to be legal I I don't want to
[08:35] not tell the tax officers uh and being
[08:39] legal requires a lot of documentation
[08:41] and all those things so I I have to
[08:44] really research how I will do next year
[08:47] so some something I can recommend at
[08:49] least talking to your local tax office
[08:51] about this is a big discussion I had
[08:52] with my local tax office here um because
[08:54] you know yeah I don't like I said I
[08:56] could kind of probably get away with not
[08:58] reporting things but but at the moment I
[09:00] do I report everything because I think
[09:02] it's the right thing to do and it's
[09:03] easier and you I'm going to avoid
[09:05] potential Trouble In My Life um so you
[09:08] know I do report it um and I had a big
[09:10] conversation with the tax office and
[09:13] essentially I convinced them that um I
[09:15] should be following the reporting
[09:17] requirements for foreign currency not
[09:19] the reporting requirements for digital
[09:22] assets um under German law and the tax
[09:26] situation is about the same but the
[09:27] reporting requirements are much much
[09:29] lower and easier for foreign currency um
[09:32] at least here in Germany so you know I
[09:33] can't speak for any other country um but
[09:36] the way that I did that was essentially
[09:37] pointed out that Bitcoin is a foreign
[09:39] currency it's the uh legal tender of uh
[09:42] the nation of El Salvador so you know
[09:44] they can't treat it differently than
[09:46] they would treat any other foreign
[09:48] currency you US dollar Australian dollar
[09:50] whatever um you know they are foreign
[09:52] currencies and so is Bitcoin and it's
[09:55] already bigger than the British pound
[09:58] indeed yep so it's not like a a very
[10:01] small IM imaginary thing it's like it's
[10:04] a big thing um I'm curious H have you
[10:08] noticed any change since you just are
[10:11] completely on a Bitcoin standard and you
[10:14] converted everything and you try to to
[10:16] live there is there anything different
[10:18] from like just buying Bitcoin and
[10:20] holding it and still being in that Fiat
[10:23] system um I'd say Yes um a lot of
[10:27] bitcoiners talk about time preference
[10:29] and I think that becomes a lot more
[10:31] noticeable when all of the money that
[10:33] you have is in Bitcoin um if you have
[10:36] some Bitcoin and some feat and you know
[10:39] you you're walking past a place which
[10:40] sells a milkshake and you think I want a
[10:43] milkshake chances are you're just going
[10:45] to you throw a couple of uh you know
[10:47] Euro or dollars or whatever on um the
[10:49] milkshake and not think about it uh
[10:52] because the value of that isn't
[10:55] meaningful to you um but if you are
[10:58] holding it in Bitcoin then you actually
[11:01] think more about it because you think
[11:03] okay do I actually want this milkshake
[11:06] um sometimes the answer is still going
[11:07] to be yes you know sometimes yeah I I
[11:09] want to have a nicer life I don't want
[11:11] to you know live like a paer and sell
[11:13] all my chairs as the mem on Twitter goes
[11:16] you know to me that's not a reasonable
[11:18] life um you I want to have a good life I
[11:20] want to enjoy things but I do now tend
[11:23] to stop and think more is this something
[11:26] I actually want to buy is this something
[11:28] I actually want to you know give up give
[11:30] up money for um when I know that money
[11:33] is going to be worth more in the future
[11:36] I think especially relevant in in in a
[11:38] bull run where you just see 40% uun in
[11:41] one month where you're like should I buy
[11:43] that new phone or can I can I can I get
[11:47] through with that old phone for one year
[11:49] more so uh it's really interesting so so
[11:52] the main different is basically how you
[11:55] look at opportunity costs by spending
[11:58] your own money because you actually know
[12:02] you
[12:03] are you're spending your Bitcoin and
[12:06] you're not spending fear so that
[12:07] actually changed something in your brain
[12:09] where you think about the opp
[12:11] opportunity cost about that purchase way
[12:14] more yeah absolutely um also it's more
[12:17] of a recent thing but I've also started
[12:19] thinking a lot more in terms of the
[12:20] price of things in sets um and I think
[12:23] that probably also has a lot to do with
[12:24] where I live and also just my my own
[12:27] unique circumstances so you know I'm in
[12:29] Germany as I said but I'm actually quite
[12:31] close to both the Czech border and the
[12:32] Polish border um so there are three
[12:35] National currencies within a short drive
[12:38] of where I live um plus the company that
[12:41] I'm working for at the moment is uh
[12:43] British so you know UK pounds is a
[12:45] frequent um fat currency that I'm
[12:48] dealing with and I I mentioned earlier I
[12:50] have a credit card that I can pay off
[12:51] using Bitcoin that credit card is
[12:53] actually denominated in Australian
[12:55] dollars so overall there's like I'll end
[12:58] for a while was also working for a US
[13:00] company who was paying me in US dollars
[13:02] so overall there's like six Fiat
[13:04] currencies all around me that you have
[13:07] some kind of influence on my life
[13:10] and they always have these kind of your
[13:12] floating exchange rates compared to each
[13:14] other so what's stable what what what
[13:18] should I actually think in my head in
[13:19] terms of your know what is the thing
[13:21] that I um count the value of something
[13:24] in what is my internal unit of account
[13:27] um and over time it just just drifted
[13:29] towards becoming Bitcoin so for a while
[13:32] it was um you know Euro for a while it
[13:35] was kind of a mix of different things so
[13:37] maybe Euro maybe US Dollars um and i'
[13:41] kind of treat things interchangeably so
[13:43] oh yeah this thing is worth you know
[13:45] $500 and this thing over here is worth
[13:47] ,000 Euro and I would then have to kind
[13:49] of even calculate what does that mean in
[13:52] relation to each other if I needed to um
[13:54] but now I've drifted more towards okay
[13:57] this thing is 5,000
[13:59] and I just have an intuitive idea in my
[14:02] head what 5,000 sets
[14:06] is I guess that's difficult to to
[14:09] calculate but you you probably are get
[14:11] getting good in it if you do it for like
[14:13] a month or two that's like okay like a
[14:16] thousand CS is a dollar so something
[14:18] like that I mean now it's it's kind of
[14:20] easy because we had like this $100,000
[14:22] Mark so uh it gets easier with the round
[14:25] numbers uh but yeah unit of account
[14:27] that's the last step right that that
[14:29] that's the last hurdle we get we have to
[14:32] get over with Bitcoin uh it's impressive
[14:34] that you're already doing that that's
[14:36] something that um not even close to
[14:38] doing it I measure my net worth so like
[14:41] uh if if I want to be like okay did I
[14:43] Chrome a net worth or not I don't even
[14:46] look at the Fiat number because I think
[14:48] it's a false number uh but if you look
[14:51] at the Bitcoin number it's like oh yeah
[14:53] like I've grown a little bit like I've
[14:55] done something this year uh because if
[14:57] you have the same amount of bitco acir
[14:59] this year and last year I don't I
[15:01] wouldn't consider you getting wealth
[15:04] here of course your purchasing power
[15:06] went up but uh I already consider my net
[15:10] worth to be only in Bitcoin so I look at
[15:12] the Bitcoin number of it but with daily
[15:15] expenses I I never did that calculation
[15:18] I I once had like a small calculator on
[15:20] my iPhone in a in the widget where I can
[15:23] just type in the Euro amount and get the
[15:25] SATs uh so that that was a fun time but
[15:28] it was just like why should I do that
[15:31] right now but if you're at that stage
[15:33] that that that that is really cool uh if
[15:35] you're already there yeah so for me it's
[15:37] not something I even deliberately tried
[15:39] to do I think it was just kind of a
[15:40] natural consequence of realizing that
[15:44] Bitcoin is my primary money and it's uh
[15:47] all of these other currencies are just
[15:49] kind of free floating around it um so at
[15:53] some point my brain just kind of latched
[15:54] on okay that thing cost me 20,000 SATs
[15:59] and I intuitively know more what that
[16:01] means than if somebody says that thing
[16:03] cost me I don't know $200 I'd actually
[16:06] have to think okay $200 that's oh yeah
[16:08] that's about 20,000 SATs okay and then I
[16:11] can uh you know understand it better oh
[16:14] yeah that that that makes definitely
[16:15] sense it also shows the power of uh what
[16:18] Bitcoin actually wants to do like the
[16:20] the one money protocol for for the world
[16:24] uh and not dealing just because you
[16:26] drive from the border from Germany to
[16:27] check to have to deal with a different
[16:29] currency which makes absolutely no sense
[16:32] at all why we have so many different
[16:34] currencies and why why do we have to
[16:36] exchange that and then there's like The
[16:37] Exchange Market making profits from them
[16:40] I'm like like like that's a that's a
[16:42] market we can just destroy with with
[16:44] Bitcoin hopefully exactly yep 100% and
[16:48] you also said uh and we know it because
[16:51] Samantha has to be had to be was already
[16:54] on the show you a father in Bitcoin uh
[16:57] with a daughter
[16:59] who is already into Bitcoin and I loved
[17:02] one thing this was one takeaway from the
[17:05] the podcast with your daughter was she's
[17:08] like Bitcoin I I presume that Bitcoin is
[17:11] normal uh and everyone is already using
[17:13] Bitcoin because she was used to it in
[17:15] the household and then she learned oh
[17:18] like there's like a Fiat thing going on
[17:20] which is amazing to see how is it to be
[17:22] uh a father in Bitcoin especially with a
[17:25] daughter that is also heavily in Bitcoin
[17:28] so
[17:29] it you know it's great being a father is
[17:31] of course you one of the most difficult
[17:33] jobs in the world it's also one of the
[17:35] most rewarding jobs in the world um you
[17:37] know having these I've got two kids um
[17:39] and you know having these two young
[17:41] human beings basically growing up in
[17:44] front of me and learning from me and you
[17:46] know trying to understand the world um
[17:49] and for me Bitcoin has always just been
[17:52] something that I have taught them about
[17:54] as a part of the world so I've never
[17:57] really treated it as something different
[17:59] a lot of the time people will come to me
[18:00] and say um when's the right time to
[18:03] introduce my kids to bitcoin um and I'll
[18:06] kind of it you know my typical answer to
[18:08] that is something along the lines of
[18:09] well you know when is the right time to
[18:11] teach your kid what money is you know
[18:14] when's the right time to teach your kid
[18:15] what a car is it's just it's a part of
[18:18] the world around you it's something
[18:20] which exists um so I teach it in the
[18:24] same way that I teach anything else you
[18:26] know I'll teach them scientific facts
[18:28] I'll teach them interesting
[18:30] philosophical ideas and I will teach
[18:32] them about you know Bitcoin as this
[18:34] thing that exists in the world just like
[18:36] anything
[18:38] else it makes sense also because like as
[18:42] soon as they can understand it they they
[18:44] should learn about it and from whom
[18:47] better than from their own parents so
[18:49] and it's also um um I I think it
[18:52] remember that she's switching to
[18:54] homeschooling or is already
[18:55] homeschooling I don't remember correctly
[18:57] switching to so uh here in Germany
[18:59] homeschooling is completely illegal um
[19:02] it's not allowed at all under any
[19:04] circumstances um so we are looking at
[19:06] moving very soon um the details of that
[19:09] still need to be finalized but yeah as
[19:11] soon as we are out of this country we
[19:13] are homeschooling yeah oh so so so you
[19:17] won more of the they leaving Germany uh
[19:21] crowd which is a big big crowd it is
[19:24] yeah yeah absolutely what what made you
[19:26] what made you switch from from from ger
[19:29] away why why leave that that country so
[19:34] it's probably a number of things but um
[19:35] you know I'm obviously not German as
[19:38] anyone can probably hear from my accent
[19:39] uh but I've lived here for about 17
[19:42] years now so quite a large chunk of my
[19:44] life and um I when I first moved here I
[19:49] thought this is a country which has a
[19:51] lot of opportunity a lot of uh
[19:53] opportunities for things to go right a
[19:55] lot of uh chances to build a a nice
[19:58] solid good European Society um and I
[20:03] feel like over the years that I've been
[20:05] here it has been getting nothing but
[20:07] worse um you know violence has been
[20:09] increasing um inequality has been
[20:12] increasing the number of you homeless
[20:14] people you see on the streets the amount
[20:15] of uh General y Petty Street crime um
[20:18] the amount of uh um crime directly from
[20:22] you government officials so you know
[20:24] things like seeing police um attacking
[20:26] people at protests and so on rather than
[20:28] just uh you know doing their job and
[20:30] defending like they're supposed to um so
[20:34] the amount of that has been increasing
[20:36] constantly so that's kind of the big
[20:37] push for me to say I'd like to go
[20:39] somewhere else but then kind of
[20:42] the the nail in the coffin the you know
[20:45] the straw that broke the camels back
[20:46] whatever you want to call it the last
[20:48] the last bit that made me say it was
[20:50] essentially the education side of things
[20:53] so um I've got two kids both of them um
[20:57] were at a private school that was
[20:58] costing me a fortune both of them are
[21:00] now at a public school and the German
[21:03] public education system is absolutely
[21:06] terrible um and it's taking so much of
[21:10] not only time but also their their will
[21:13] and their Joy of learning it's uh you
[21:15] know in my opinion it's it's making them
[21:18] less interested in the world around them
[21:20] and to me that's the most horrible thing
[21:22] to see to see my kids go from being hey
[21:26] I want to learn I love learning tell me
[21:28] all about the world to being uh do I
[21:31] have to do this do I have to learn about
[21:32] maths um you know when am I ever going
[21:35] to use this in the real world you know
[21:38] the passion for learning just kind of
[21:41] got crushed out of them by this
[21:42] education system and I want to reins
[21:45] that in them and I don't think I can do
[21:47] that while they are at a German school
[21:49] so you know that was kind of the last
[21:51] thing and I I have to get them out of
[21:53] here yeah that's one on True by the way
[21:56] that's the same thing forra um I heard
[21:59] someone saying that moved out of Austria
[22:01] that Austria is five years better than
[22:05] than Germany but they if they contining
[22:06] like that in five years the same as in
[22:08] Germany right now and Switzerland is
[22:10] five years better than Austria something
[22:13] something along those lines h i get more
[22:16] and more hope honestly with the Austrian
[22:18] politicians that I see right now
[22:19] especially uh when I see what people are
[22:23] voting for and and what kind of agendas
[22:26] they're voting for so it gives me a lot
[22:28] of Hope uh that the the population is
[22:30] waking up to the realities um but I I
[22:34] actually watch politics right now very
[22:36] closely uh in Austria only uh because I
[22:40] can move in an instant like I I don't
[22:43] have any income from Austria actually
[22:45] like no no income stream from me is from
[22:48] Austria it does not make sense to for me
[22:50] to be in Austria so I can be very quick
[22:52] away um but I still feel like there's
[22:57] hope uh and when I talk with uh Germans
[23:00] and when I see Germany I like there I
[23:03] probably would have already left I'm
[23:06] really cool I don't know if you want to
[23:08] reveal where you move but uh one thing I
[23:11] really want to know is like what role
[23:13] has Bitcoin played for you in deciding
[23:17] where to move like what what what big of
[23:19] a thing was Bitcoin for you or was the
[23:22] education and the other things you
[23:23] mentioned the the the proper ones and
[23:26] Bitcoin just being like Oh it shouldn't
[23:28] be
[23:29] it shouldn't be
[23:30] China yeah so essentially that it was
[23:33] primar it's primarily the other things
[23:35] um so yeah I don't mind saying we we're
[23:36] moving we're planning on moving to the
[23:38] UK um and the main reason for that is
[23:41] that uh my wife um is German born spend
[23:45] her entire life here and doesn't want to
[23:48] be too far away from her parents so we
[23:50] need to be somewhere which is easy
[23:52] travel back to where her parents are um
[23:55] so you know that kind of rules out for
[23:57] example you moving to Central America
[24:00] which uh you might have been on my list
[24:02] if not for the fact that you that would
[24:04] be too far for my wife um so um yeah
[24:08] we're we're planning on moving to the UK
[24:10] and it's largely around the things that
[24:12] I already mentioned um uh in the UK
[24:15] homeschooling is completely Allowed no
[24:17] problem um so that's uh you that problem
[24:20] solved um and I am somewhat concerned
[24:25] about what I see happening in politics
[24:26] over there but I think that's large true
[24:28] in most of the world no matter where we
[24:30] move politics is going to be a problem
[24:33] um especially for my political Outlook
[24:37] in general um you know I I got into
[24:40] Bitcoin um in 2010 and my journey into
[24:44] Bitcoin came out of my political Journey
[24:47] um I've always been interested in
[24:49] anarchism as a political philosophy so
[24:52] not just you know chaos but actual um
[24:56] wellth thought out political Anarchy
[24:58] rules without rulers how do you
[25:00] establish a society that has rules and
[25:03] has um the people deciding what we want
[25:05] to do but doesn't have a centralized
[25:09] lawgiver doesn't have a centralized um
[25:11] person or group of people to say this is
[25:13] how Society has to run so that was
[25:17] always something of great interest to me
[25:19] and one of the big problems I always saw
[25:20] was money money has this massively
[25:23] centralized uh you know approach to it
[25:26] so how would that work in a
[25:28] decentralized way and then Along Came
[25:30] Bitcoin so it was uh obvious for me to
[25:32] kind of jump in and become a Bitcoin it
[25:34] just seemed like the perfect fit because
[25:36] it's what I was already looking into for
[25:39] every other aspect of society so uh you
[25:41] know money being one of the big ones
[25:44] Bitcoin was just uh obvious um so yeah
[25:47] Bitcoin I don't see it being a problem
[25:50] anywhere that we would be likely to move
[25:53] um I think it's already too big for
[25:55] governments to say things like oh yeah
[25:56] we're going to unilaterally ban Bitcoin
[25:58] in the country you I don't think that
[26:00] will happen even here in Germany which
[26:02] is uh quite strict on how people manage
[26:06] their money and what people do with
[26:07] their money and wanting to see what
[26:09] you're doing with your money and so on I
[26:10] can't even imagine Germany Banning
[26:12] Bitcoin it's too late for that kind of
[26:14] thing absolutely I I mean there is this
[26:17] thing of taxes uh I think Italy
[26:21] increased the taxes on bitcoin heavily
[26:23] where I'm like okay nobody will move to
[26:25] Italy I guess and they will move out of
[26:27] Italy I think from 20 or like 40 or
[26:30] something like that and in France I just
[26:33] heard but I think that's not law right
[26:35] now I think it's just a discussion where
[26:37] they think about unrealized capital
[26:39] gains on on bitcoin um which uh is
[26:43] obviously an absurd idea and completely
[26:46] BS but but that that's that's I think
[26:50] the the only last thing that I'm worried
[26:53] about that politicians just try to tax
[26:55] the hell out of it I I'm completely with
[26:57] you they will not ban it it's just too
[26:59] much like you cannot do it anymore uh
[27:02] it's like Banning the internet something
[27:03] like that we we know how it goes in in
[27:06] in North Korea and how those countries
[27:08] end up but uh taxes I guess um is the
[27:11] only thing that I would still look at uh
[27:14] in in terms of Bitcoin I have no clue
[27:16] what the the rule in in the UK for that
[27:18] is yeah it's it's complicated but uh
[27:21] yeah it's it's not too arduous but it's
[27:24] complicated um but yeah overall uh I
[27:27] think
[27:28] one thing as bitcoiners that we do need
[27:30] to be careful of is is reading too much
[27:34] into what happens for example with that
[27:36] proposal in France I actually honestly
[27:39] think from what I've seen of it um the
[27:41] people who wrote it weren't even
[27:42] thinking about Bitcoin at all it was
[27:44] simply caught up because they
[27:46] essentially said we want the government
[27:49] to have more money in order to do the
[27:50] things that we want to do let's look at
[27:53] um you know uh unrealized capital gains
[27:56] tax so essentially you know what if if
[27:58] people are holding any kind of
[28:00] unproductive asset I think was their
[28:02] wording um you know that that
[28:04] unproductive asset should have some kind
[28:06] of unrealized capital gains STX I very
[28:08] much doubt they were thinking of Bitcoin
[28:11] much at all like maybe it was a side
[28:13] note at some point oh yeah there's these
[28:14] cryptocurrency things that gets thrown
[28:16] into the bucket but uh I think the
[28:19] biggest thing we actually need to be
[28:21] concerned about is when they start
[28:22] talking about Bitcoin directly uh when
[28:25] politicians talk about Bitcoin directly
[28:27] that's when you should really set up and
[28:29] pay attention far more than when they do
[28:32] you know do other things and just kind
[28:33] of throw Bitcoin into the same bucket I
[28:36] think that's the problem that all
[28:37] governments right now face they have a
[28:39] budget problem like they the the the
[28:43] debt is just growing and and people are
[28:45] like hey like costs are increasing and
[28:47] so they have two options they can
[28:49] increase taxes print more money uh or
[28:53] they can um
[28:55] save and governments don't want to stop
[28:58] spending they they really don't want to
[28:59] save but they have to uh and yeah even
[29:03] even in Austria right now there's an
[29:04] interesting conversation going on uh
[29:07] because right now the new government is
[29:08] forming where one side wants to have no
[29:11] taxes at all and one side is like oh
[29:13] like let's increase taxes let's let's
[29:15] let's just increase the taxes uh and
[29:18] then we uh say then we are solving the
[29:21] the the the part of the budget that that
[29:24] is uh uh Missing uh and essentially what
[29:28] they are now proposing is hiring the uh
[29:31] um increasing the taxes on properties so
[29:35] property taxes why because properties
[29:39] cannot move out of Austria Bitcoin can
[29:41] uh stocks to a certain extent can other
[29:44] things can way more easily remove out of
[29:47] Austria h properties uh selling a
[29:50] property uh it's it's a it's a long
[29:53] longer process of selling Bitcoin or
[29:55] selling uh stocks or yeah Bitcoin you
[29:58] can just it's not even in any
[30:00] jurisdiction uh actually so it's it's
[30:03] it's really hard to or the hardest asset
[30:05] to tax I think um what I'm also curious
[30:08] about is was outside of the EU a factor
[30:12] for
[30:13] you
[30:15] um not so much um perhaps slightly
[30:18] because of course the EU can be um
[30:21] problematic at times um they can but
[30:25] they also actually I'm not going to say
[30:27] the EU is terrible in every single way
[30:29] because they actually also you know do
[30:31] have some advantages um one of the
[30:34] difficult problems with talking about
[30:36] breaking up a large um governmental body
[30:41] is that you actually end up with more
[30:44] authoritarianism in smaller groups so
[30:47] this is something I see a lot in the US
[30:49] which I think people don't realize as
[30:51] much uh when they say okay we want to
[30:53] you know remove as much power from the
[30:55] federal government as possible and give
[30:57] it out to the state giving the states
[30:59] more power actually tends to make people
[31:02] less free it tends to decrease Freedom
[31:04] as the individual states tend to become
[31:06] more
[31:07] authoritarian and I actually see a
[31:09] similar potential with um the European
[31:12] Union um if the EU breaks up which I
[31:15] actually think it probably will at some
[31:17] point you know probably even within my
[31:19] lifetime um I don't think the EU has a
[31:21] long life left ahead of it and when that
[31:24] happens you know if and when that
[31:25] happens I actually see a lot of people
[31:28] suffering quite badly under
[31:30] authoritarian regimes because people
[31:32] want to fill a power vacuum and they
[31:34] will jump in and they will take power
[31:35] and they will want to control others and
[31:38] ultimately that's like I said that's the
[31:40] reason I'm a bitcoiner is because I'm an
[31:41] anarchist I care more about individual
[31:44] freedom than I do about almost anything
[31:48] else um but I think individual freedom
[31:50] is often misunderstood it's often
[31:53] misunderstood as I should be allowed to
[31:55] do anything I want the problem with the
[31:57] idea if I should be allowed to do
[31:59] anything I want is that includes
[32:00] limiting other people's freedoms if you
[32:02] want maximal freedom for everyone you do
[32:05] actually have to have some kind of
[32:07] societal system which ensures maximal
[32:11] freedom for everyone and that's what all
[32:14] serious discussions about anarchism are
[32:15] actually about they're about how do we
[32:18] organize ourselves how do we come
[32:19] together as people as individuals to
[32:23] maximize the freedom for each of us um
[32:26] and I think that's something which is
[32:27] not discussed well enough um in most
[32:31] yeah Mo most discussions about the topic
[32:33] um even in the Bitcoin space because it
[32:35] it's quite funny Bitcoin already works
[32:37] that way Bitcoin is a consensus
[32:39] algorithm Bitcoin is very notably
[32:42] something that requires that everyone is
[32:46] behaving in the same way and agreeing to
[32:48] the same rule sets otherwise they are
[32:49] not a part of the Network anymore you
[32:52] know if I all of a sudden set my node to
[32:54] say I own all of that Bitcoin that you
[32:56] do then well yeah according to my node I
[32:58] do and I can access it because I've got
[33:00] special rules for those utxos but if I
[33:03] try and broadcast that um uh broadcast a
[33:06] transaction to the rest of the network
[33:08] which spends one of your to utxos
[33:10] everybody else will say no that's not
[33:12] the rules that I agree to therefore
[33:14] that's not valid that's not okay so that
[33:18] kind of consensus approach is something
[33:21] that is needed outside of Bitcoin as
[33:24] well in order to actually organize
[33:25] society and not just have a free-for-all
[33:28] I do whatever I want kind of uh freedom
[33:31] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[33:34] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[33:37] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[33:40] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[33:43] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[33:46] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[33:49] go out there and show that you are a
[33:52] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[33:54] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante has
[33:57] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:00] Genesis edition of their watch
[34:03] collections you have the date of the
[34:05] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[34:09] and of course also the block height and
[34:11] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[34:15] level of detail they put in in this
[34:17] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[34:19] those amazing coin Vigilant the time
[34:22] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[34:25] those watches so so much if you watch or
[34:28] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[34:31] I'll guess you already bought some
[34:33] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[34:36] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[34:39] in a hardware wallet my personal
[34:41] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[34:43] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[34:45] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[34:47] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[34:50] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[34:54] with the code Robin at the checkout
[34:56] visit bitbox . Swiss robobin to get your
[35:01] bitbox and the next step is to really
[35:03] level up your sovereignty as an
[35:05] individual you have to have the most
[35:07] secure self- custody setup you have to
[35:10] secure your own devices you have to
[35:13] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:16] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:18] where you live you even want to have a
[35:21] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:23] in case something goes really really
[35:25] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:27] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:30] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:33] way.com SLP Partners Robin you even get
[35:37] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[35:40] you can level up your
[35:42] sovereignty that's super interesting to
[35:44] to look at so the the the the EU could
[35:50] actually increase the freedoms because
[35:53] it allows that the the the smaller ones
[35:56] are not as authoritarian and that I
[35:58] never I never considered that actually
[36:01] is that a shortterm thing or is that
[36:03] something that is actually longterm
[36:05] there no absolutely it's a short-term
[36:07] thing um so the problem with these super
[36:11] supranatural um supranational um things
[36:14] like the EU is they are naturally
[36:17] authoritarian themselves they will
[36:18] naturally restrict freedoms and so on
[36:21] the problem it's not that the the EU
[36:24] increases Freedom it doesn't it's that
[36:26] the breakup of the EU would decrease
[36:29] Freedom so it's not that they are
[36:32] increasing it it's just that getting rid
[36:33] of them would decrease it and that's
[36:35] that's where you get these kinds of
[36:37] problems and uh I think so you I can't
[36:40] solve all the world's problems myself
[36:42] you I don't know the answer to these
[36:44] kinds of things but I think one of the
[36:47] best ways to get rid of authoritarian
[36:51] governments um whether it's at a
[36:52] national or a supranational or even a
[36:54] subnational level the best way to get
[36:57] rid of authoritarianism is to make it
[36:59] obsolete make it unimportant make it not
[37:03] um capable get rid of its teeth so
[37:07] Bitcoin does that with money um we don't
[37:10] need in Bitcoin to say okay we're going
[37:12] to establish a new Central Bank and this
[37:14] new Central Bank is responsible for
[37:15] Bitcoin and it's a better kind of money
[37:17] and then kick out the old Central Bank
[37:20] all we need to do is make Bitcoin so
[37:22] good that other currencies become
[37:25] worthless and the central banks have no
[37:27] teeth anymore they can't do anything bad
[37:29] because they have no power um that's how
[37:33] you stop authoritarianism by building
[37:36] something better not by trying to
[37:38] actually kick it out um yeah I think
[37:41] that's the problem the um the marxists
[37:44] made back in the you know the early days
[37:46] of socialism they said we're going to
[37:49] take over the government kick out the
[37:50] current government and then build a
[37:52] government of the People by the people
[37:54] and for the people they built a new
[37:56] government sure and was just as
[37:58] authoritarian and terrible as the
[37:59] previous ones because you give somebody
[38:02] power they don't want to give it up they
[38:04] you know they say it's for the people
[38:06] and they'll use the language of it being
[38:07] for the people but it really wasn't you
[38:09] know the USSR was an authoritarian
[38:12] regime um and that is what happens with
[38:16] authoritarianism in general if you try
[38:17] and build a new centralized structure
[38:20] and take over the old one you will have
[38:23] the same problems instead you need to
[38:25] build something from the ground up which
[38:27] makes the old thing obsolete not just
[38:30] replaced so basically when we have
[38:34] options like El Salvador and other
[38:36] countries that are building something
[38:38] better this in hindsight then also makes
[38:42] Germany and other count is long-term
[38:44] better because they have to kind of uh
[38:46] keep up with that or otherwise they will
[38:49] lose the the best talents to those
[38:52] countries yes um but I would even say I
[38:55] look at it on a smaller scale than that
[38:58] I care much more about what Bitcoin
[39:01] beach in elante did and what um Berlin
[39:04] in uh El Salvador not Bill and Germany
[39:07] but Bill and El Salvador I care much
[39:08] more about what they are doing than what
[39:10] the government of El Salvador is doing
[39:12] with Bitcoin because those bottomup
[39:15] approaches cannot be co-opted and
[39:18] destroyed as easily as a centralized
[39:21] government at some point president bukel
[39:24] could turn around and be evil he could
[39:27] you know steal people's Bitcoin he could
[39:29] say okay I'm enforcing some kind of
[39:31] Draconian laws um whereby you know you
[39:33] have to give up your Bitcoin to the
[39:34] government I don't think he's going to
[39:36] do that but what about when he's not in
[39:38] power anymore what about the next guy
[39:40] and the next guy after that and the next
[39:41] guy after that as long as you've got a
[39:43] centralized government doing these
[39:45] things those risks exist with the
[39:47] bottomup approach that you get in um you
[39:50] know local circular economies you don't
[39:52] have those kinds of concerns as much
[39:54] because you can freely join leave um any
[39:59] kind of uh Community approach like that
[40:02] so yeah you I think El Salvador's great
[40:05] I love it as a country I think it's
[40:06] beautiful I love seeing the progress
[40:08] there I think I've been there three
[40:10] years in a row now and uh every year I
[40:12] see more and more improvements I think
[40:15] it's great and uh you know I'm I'm
[40:17] certainly not going to say you know hey
[40:19] Buel is a terrible dictator or anything
[40:21] ter anything like that you he's
[40:22] certainly not but as long as it is a
[40:24] centralized government those risks exist
[40:27] um so yeah especially with with a guy
[40:30] that is so popular I think being uh a
[40:34] leader that is extremely popular has his
[40:38] disadvantages because uh he he can also
[40:42] misuse that obviously um but yeah I
[40:45] think he he's has done a great job so
[40:48] it's an indicator that he might do also
[40:51] a great job the next five years uh and
[40:54] will be interesting to to look at El
[40:56] salador is also um an interesting
[41:00] country to to see to move at it's really
[41:03] hard because it's like a very long
[41:05] flight from Austria it's like almost 24
[41:08] hours of Total travel from like door to
[41:10] door uh but uh it's it's definitely an
[41:13] interesting country Central America in
[41:15] general is is very interesting and I met
[41:18] a lot of Germans in Central America uh
[41:21] there there a lot of people seem to to
[41:24] move there uh but yeah also America is
[41:28] is is interesting to to look at if if
[41:31] they move in the right direction how do
[41:33] you look in general at what America has
[41:36] done uh this year and what the
[41:38] presidential election is is that more of
[41:40] like just hype and just saying the right
[41:43] words to be elected or could that
[41:45] actually bring change in how the USA is
[41:48] is functioning in the
[41:50] future I think both um so you know I I I
[41:55] make absolutely no secret of the fact
[41:57] that I think Donald Trump is dangerous
[41:59] and relatively stupid you know I don't
[42:02] think he's a smart man um I think he's
[42:05] essentially very much a businessman who
[42:07] will say what is necessary in order to
[42:09] get people to like him to get votes to
[42:12] control people in the way that he wants
[42:15] um but he also surrounds himself with
[42:17] people who have other agendas and I
[42:20] think those other agendas are incredibly
[42:22] dangerous at times some of them can have
[42:25] positive results um I think it is going
[42:28] to be relatively good for um you know
[42:31] Bitcoin in terms of getting it out there
[42:34] into the understanding of people getting
[42:36] more people to be aware of Bitcoin make
[42:38] it more visible make it more accepted as
[42:42] a thing that is okay because a lot of
[42:44] people still have this perception
[42:45] bitcoin's this weird strange thing
[42:47] mostly used by scammers and you know I
[42:49] don't want to touch it I don't want to
[42:50] learn about it but if you see you know
[42:53] hey the government is saying they are um
[42:55] setting up a Bitcoin reserve the Govern
[42:57] is saying you can use Bitcoin as a
[42:59] medium of exchange and going to remove
[43:01] taxes on it and that sort of thing I
[43:03] think will have some very positive
[43:05] effects but I think that's incidental
[43:08] and not really even part of the part of
[43:11] the core plan um if there even is any
[43:14] kind of core plan um of that incoming
[43:17] government I think it's really is just
[43:19] this incidental thing um you I think we
[43:21] see that with uh the way that Donald
[43:23] Trump went and talked at uh um the
[43:26] Bitcoin conference there um in Nashville
[43:28] and then you know almost almost
[43:30] immediately went went away and launched
[43:32] some kind of shitcoin type thing you
[43:34] know it's uh he he doesn't understand it
[43:37] he isn't even surrounded by that many
[43:40] people who understand it there's a few
[43:41] and those few I think are probably going
[43:43] to do some very good things for Bitcoin
[43:45] but that doesn't necessarily mean
[43:46] they're going to be doing good things
[43:48] for everything else that I consider
[43:50] valuable um especially in terms of
[43:52] overall freedom I think freedoms in the
[43:55] US are actually eroding at the moment
[43:57] and it doesn't matter whether it's the
[43:59] Democrats or the Republicans in power
[44:01] every single um Administration over the
[44:04] last 20 to 40 years has been reducing
[44:08] the freedoms that the people have and I
[44:10] don't see that
[44:11] changing this interesting uh
[44:14] that's uh mostly um Bitcoin is
[44:19] extremely um uh what should I say
[44:23] extremely positive towards the the next
[44:25] Administration
[44:27] uh not apparent not necessarily because
[44:31] of trump uh they look at RFK quite
[44:33] positively they look at V Rave quite
[44:36] positively but yeah it's an it's an
[44:39] interesting mix of of characters in
[44:42] there uh and also that with e mask in
[44:45] there it's that's a completely unknown
[44:48] will be interesting how it pays out yeah
[44:50] it is so you know I'm I'm always going
[44:53] to be hopeful that things are better
[44:57] than I assume but uh you right now I
[44:59] don't have any evidence to think it's
[45:01] actually going to be as good as a lot of
[45:03] people are saying um you it's also worth
[45:05] noting that you as a classical Anarchist
[45:08] I am definitely not um politically
[45:11] aligned to the vast majority of loud
[45:14] voices on bitcoin Twitter so you know
[45:16] the vast majority of um I I I call them
[45:20] larians so Libertarians but they're just
[45:22] laughing it um because they they've
[45:25] never thought their philosophy through
[45:26] they've never really gone deep into what
[45:28] it potentially means um to have a a
[45:32] truly libertarian Society um they throw
[45:35] around terms like anarco capitalism
[45:37] without even realizing that capitalism
[45:40] as a concept is um at odds with
[45:43] anarchism as a concept capitalism
[45:45] actually requires centralized control as
[45:47] a con as a political philosophy so those
[45:51] two you cannot be an anarco
[45:53] capitalist from my understanding of
[45:56] those words and I guess from you from
[45:58] what most political philosophers would
[45:59] say that doesn't actually work um I get
[46:03] what they mean when they say it and they
[46:04] actually mean some kind of completely
[46:07] open free market Anarchist which is
[46:09] actually different to capitalism but uh
[46:12] um it's still something they haven't
[46:14] thought through enough to really have a
[46:16] coherent political philosophy and they
[46:18] tend to be very self-contradictory at
[46:20] times so yeah I I don't politically
[46:23] align with a lot of bitcoiners and I
[46:24] think that uh does lead to a lot of
[46:26] arguments a lot of the time online um
[46:29] but they can be productive arguments I
[46:31] think uh you know I can learn some
[46:32] things from other people and they can
[46:33] learn some things from me really
[46:35] interesting what kind of ideology or
[46:38] like political direction do you think
[46:41] Bitcoin will bring to the world if it
[46:44] changes anything at
[46:46] all so I think that's really difficult
[46:49] to say because I think Bitcoin will
[46:50] always be a part of something else it
[46:52] will be a part of other movements bit
[46:54] people like to say Bitcoin fixes this
[46:57] Bitcoin does fix a lot of things Bitcoin
[46:59] doesn't fix everything in the world
[47:01] anyone who tries to say it is is
[47:03] dreaming um so the things that Bitcoin
[47:07] fixes are generally in the direction of
[47:11] um Freedom loving governments Freedom
[47:14] loving ideas it's very difficult for a
[47:17] truly dictatorial authoritarian to use
[47:21] and be interested in Bitcoin um
[47:23] internally they can definitely use it
[47:26] externally you know Can See For example
[47:27] North Korea wanting to amass a large
[47:29] amount of Bitcoin and then use it
[47:31] externally in order to increase their
[47:34] wealth and uh you know do things in
[47:36] their country to increase their own
[47:37] power um but to actually use it
[47:40] internally would be quite damaging for
[47:43] them because of the freedom that Bitcoin
[47:45] allows um
[47:47] so it's kind of got these two faces to
[47:50] it and it depends on how governments use
[47:52] it as to what kind of uh you know
[47:56] benefits or disadvantages it gives them
[47:58] so yeah Bitcoin is freedom Tech but what
[48:01] that freedom looks like and how people
[48:04] wield it probably matters more than just
[48:08] the basics
[48:10] yeah the last Nation uh I want to get
[48:13] over with you I didn't Bland that but it
[48:16] disrupted uh the last nation that I'm
[48:18] really interested in in your opinion is
[48:21] uh you probably looked at it is
[48:22] Switzerland uh it's out of the EU it has
[48:27] as I see a really good functioning
[48:29] direct democracy it has a heavy load of
[48:32] costs to it uh but also lower taxes so
[48:36] depends on on what your income stream is
[48:38] depending on uh how do you look at
[48:41] Switzerland um Switzerland does in
[48:43] general give me a lot of Hope because it
[48:45] is like you said it's a good example of
[48:47] direct democracy mostly working it's not
[48:51] perfect I think every um system you know
[48:54] has its flaws but as far as a long
[48:58] running functional direct democracy goes
[49:00] there is no better example than
[49:02] Switzerland um so I can imagine them
[49:06] benefiting greatly from Bitcoin if
[49:09] there's a lot more activity happening
[49:12] there um to actually start implementing
[49:15] things so I was in I was actually in
[49:16] Switzerland recently in uh tune um near
[49:20] B um for a small conference called
[49:22] Bitcoin helps um it was actually the
[49:24] first time I gave an entire Workshop in
[49:26] German which was very difficult for me
[49:28] not my native language but uh I managed
[49:30] it somehow um and yeah I I really
[49:35] appreciate the overall sense of
[49:38] community organization I would guess I'd
[49:41] say in Switzerland people feel like they
[49:43] can make a difference in their society
[49:46] which is quite different to the feeling
[49:48] in Germany in Germany people think of I
[49:51] I can vote for whoever's in charge and
[49:52] then they're the ones who actually get
[49:54] to do stuff in Switzerland a lot more
[49:57] feel that if you want to change the
[50:00] society that you're in get out there and
[50:02] change it um so I think that's a very
[50:05] positive thing and if they start doing a
[50:08] lot more stuff with Bitcoin I can see
[50:10] Bitcoin taking off their very well and
[50:12] of course you know in Lugano um that's
[50:15] already happening to an extent um I know
[50:18] that there are some discussions in and
[50:19] around B at the moment for um that kind
[50:22] of thing to happen or for more Bitcoin
[50:23] stuff to happen um so we'll see how
[50:27] things go there um you know I wouldn't
[50:29] be against the idea of living in
[50:31] Switzerland one day um the only reason
[50:33] it wasn't on our list of places to
[50:35] consider for moving um W with this move
[50:38] now is largely the costs it's uh yeah as
[50:41] you said it's quite an expensive place
[50:43] and um yeah you know uh I'm not that I'm
[50:46] not that much of a rich man despite
[50:48] discovering Bitcoin in 2010 uh you know
[50:50] I'd rather increase my Bitcoin Holdings
[50:52] and not decrease them over
[50:54] time yeah ABS absolutely uh yeah
[50:57] Switzerland is is costly I always look
[51:00] at Switzerland as as uh a great escape
[51:03] patch for for me because I live in in
[51:06] Austria it's very close to Switzerland
[51:08] uh I probably drive just a few hours
[51:11] from my place uh to come to the Swiss
[51:15] border U yeah maybe five hours six hours
[51:17] something like that uh which just means
[51:20] I'm really quickly in Switzerland which
[51:22] means I really quickly am back at where
[51:25] I uh was growing up with like parents
[51:28] and friends and stuff like that um but
[51:31] it's it's expensive it's like three
[51:35] times sometimes four times the cost of
[51:37] Austria depending on on what you look at
[51:39] so it's really an expensive place uh you
[51:43] you probably need um a really good
[51:45] Running Company to uh make it
[51:50] worthwhile as the taxes are quite lower
[51:53] uh especially for corporations but also
[51:55] for for income in general uh so if if
[51:58] you are a high income earner or have a
[52:02] company running then it might make sense
[52:05] uh because just tax savings but in
[52:08] general it's it's an expensive place or
[52:09] if you have a work in Switzerland they
[52:12] also pay more uh than than all of a
[52:14] sudden it could also make a huge
[52:16] difference but yeah really cool um then
[52:19] you have been as as we said before long
[52:22] in the space and I think there's always
[52:25] new people coming into the space so like
[52:26] people that have just been two three
[52:28] years in the space um what do you make
[52:31] in general out of this year uh with
[52:35] Trump with uh ETFs with the Haring with
[52:38] all the with maybe soon the 100K maybe
[52:41] if we release that we already over there
[52:44] who knows um with so many things
[52:46] happening so many mil happens what do we
[52:48] make out of this year this year has been
[52:51] an interesting one um I think there's
[52:53] been a lot more
[52:56] social media influence on bitcoin itself
[53:00] um which is not necessarily a positive
[53:02] thing um the loudest voices tend to get
[53:04] a lot of control where previously I
[53:08] don't think that happened quite as much
[53:10] um so to give an example um know there's
[53:13] all of the arguments about um new OP
[53:16] codes so having some kind of um CTV cat
[53:20] type uh op code um and people's
[53:25] decisions and what people's allegiances
[53:27] to different Alternatives or do
[53:29] something or don't do something or
[53:30] whatever tend to be influenced by the
[53:33] people who are advocating for or against
[53:36] things rather than on the technical
[53:38] merits or um you know other reasonable
[53:42] things to consider um so it'll be like
[53:45] saying uh you know um uh I'm going to
[53:48] Godwin this discussion here but uh um
[53:51] you Adolf Hitler was in favor of animal
[53:53] rights therefore we should be against
[53:55] animal rights you know it's it's a
[53:57] stupid argument it it's uh you know um
[54:00] yeah he did some absolutely terrible
[54:02] things he actually surprisingly did a
[54:04] couple of good things and you know in my
[54:06] opinion animal rights was one of those
[54:08] so um I think yeah arguing um that a
[54:13] particular uh op code proposal is bad
[54:16] because of the people who are um
[54:18] promoting it is just silly but I think
[54:21] that is actually influencing development
[54:24] decisions around Bitcoin and uh that's a
[54:27] negative that I see for this year a
[54:29] positive however that I see for this
[54:30] year is there seems to be a lot more
[54:33] Focus now on actually educating people
[54:37] rather than just yelling at them um so
[54:41] in previous years probably the last four
[54:44] or five years um somebody would come
[54:46] along and say you know oh I kind of
[54:49] interested in Bitcoin but you know I'm
[54:51] too scared to self- custody so you know
[54:54] I'm just going to keep all of my coins
[54:55] on coinbase
[54:56] and on Twitter they would get all of a
[54:58] sudden spammed by people saying have fun
[55:00] staying poor which it it doesn't help
[55:04] anything it doesn't do anything useful
[55:05] or good um all it you know it's just
[55:08] insulting and childish really but you
[55:10] know that was very common um up until
[55:14] probably this year where I've seen a lot
[55:16] more oh I can help you with that I can
[55:19] you know you know point you to some
[55:20] resources I can show you a good video
[55:23] from uh you know some um podcaster or
[55:26] demon person who's demonstrating things
[55:28] um to say take a look at this this is
[55:31] it's not that hard to self- custody
[55:33] here's what you need to know here's what
[55:34] you should learn you know hit me up via
[55:37] DM if you need any more info I'm seeing
[55:39] that a lot more and I think that's
[55:41] definitely a huge positive this year it
[55:43] feels more like the early days of
[55:45] Bitcoin um back before you know 2013 or
[55:48] so everybody was willing to help
[55:50] everybody else and that disappeared for
[55:52] a few years but I think it looks like
[55:54] it's coming back and uh I like that it's
[55:57] interesting how on on the one side you
[56:01] saw that it got more uh screamy where
[56:05] the yeah the the the irrational side
[56:09] kind of came out of humans and the other
[56:11] side where the rational side let's let's
[56:13] help them let's educate them comes out
[56:15] more um is are those things out of the
[56:19] consequence that the space in general is
[56:21] just growing and like the next wave of
[56:24] of bitcoiners that might not
[56:26] might be uh far different from those who
[56:30] entered in 2012 out of different reasons
[56:33] and now just entering the space uh and
[56:36] maybe also more institutionalized maybe
[56:38] more from the Fiat uh side of things um
[56:43] quite possibly yes I think there's a lot
[56:45] more diversity now appearing in the
[56:48] Bitcoin space than there has been over
[56:50] the last 10 years or so um again the the
[56:53] early days of Bitcoin were also very
[56:55] very diverse so so you it wasn't just a
[56:57] monoculture politically it wasn't a
[57:00] monoculture on you know um gender race
[57:04] political beliefs all of these different
[57:05] things it was quite diverse and then for
[57:09] a while it kind of became young white
[57:13] Western men um and that was 80 to 90% of
[57:17] people in Bitcoin um and they they were
[57:20] the loudest voices on social media they
[57:23] were the ones who were basically saying
[57:24] you know we control Bitcoin this this is
[57:26] who we are this is what bitcoiners are
[57:28] young white Western um right-wing men um
[57:34] but if you actually look at the
[57:36] statistics um of Bitcoin holders so I
[57:39] saw somebody post it recently
[57:42] unfortunately I don't remember who it
[57:43] was but I saw some nice statistics
[57:45] posted of who are Bitcoin holders um you
[57:49] know and it was kind of broken down by
[57:50] age and uh political leanings and so on
[57:53] and it really is actually quite diverse
[57:55] so it's more a case of who's loud on
[57:58] social media compared to who the actual
[58:00] people are so I think that's probably
[58:02] what's happening now is that more people
[58:04] are finding their voice and willing to
[58:06] actually um speak up as the space itself
[58:09] grows um so people who maybe felt like
[58:13] they weren't represented in Bitcoin are
[58:16] now seeing that they actually are
[58:17] because Bitcoin is for everyone I have
[58:20] something interesting um uh that I share
[58:23] every once in a while it's just uh um my
[58:27] YouTube statistics and I have depending
[58:30] on the month around 50,000 to 100,000 uh
[58:33] people uh tuning into at least one video
[58:37] uh per month so I think the the base is
[58:40] not huge but it's it's somewhat uh
[58:43] representative I guess uh and what you
[58:46] see here interesting enough even though
[58:48] I'm very young I'm
[58:50] 26 uh my listener base uh is is quite
[58:55] way older than than I am for example I
[58:58] have over 65 uh almost
[59:01] 7% uh and under uh under 25 there's just
[59:05] like 2% or not even 2% H so like under
[59:09] my age there are like 2% people and over
[59:12] 65 years old is 7% and then the average
[59:16] is probably somewhere around the the 40
[59:19] uh 4 years old or like 40 years old Mark
[59:23] uh which is probably the the the real
[59:27] where we see from age wise I don't have
[59:29] any more insights of course like the the
[59:31] countries but yeah it's English speaking
[59:33] so uh of course Germans will listen less
[59:37] and and other people but that's kind of
[59:40] I was shocked how mature the the the
[59:44] audience already is yeah absolutely um I
[59:46] did notice there though skewed very
[59:48] heavily male something like 93 point
[59:50] something per male 6.6% female so yeah
[59:54] exactly 93 uh percent male and it's it's
[59:58] been it it moves around between in the
[60:01] beginning it was like 2% so like in the
[60:03] beginning was really bad uh but also the
[60:06] 20 the first 20 or 30 episodes were just
[60:09] males uh and now I actually actively
[60:13] seek uh females to be on the show uh
[60:16] because funny um I get uh DMS from
[60:21] people that say like hey I'm here I want
[60:23] to be on the
[60:24] show never ever I got it uh from a woman
[60:29] uh that hasn't been uh poked by someone
[60:31] else I have for example Rachel
[60:35] guia and she says to women like hey DM
[60:38] Robin to be on his show uh but never
[60:41] ever had a woman is like hey I'm here
[60:43] want to be on the show so so I can I can
[60:46] active I have to actively seek them uh
[60:48] so they can be on the show and like hey
[60:50] do you want to be in my show uh so that
[60:54] I had to realize to actually them so
[60:56] then I also have the females on the
[60:58] guest and then actually uh it went from
[61:01] like 2% to 5 S8 the highest was at like
[61:06] 9% um but I'm also male so uh with with
[61:10] a female host probably would have been
[61:13] would be better I know Natalie prell uh
[61:16] she has a huge uh following and she's
[61:19] probably the biggest one uh biggest
[61:22] female podcast holer in Bitcoin and she
[61:25] has a 20 % rate of females um and I
[61:29] guess that's then the the highest
[61:31] someone can get in in Bitcoin but yeah
[61:33] it's it's it's heavily made yeah so
[61:37] that's actually where I'd
[61:38] be I would actually be interested to see
[61:41] how much of that is um um kind of a
[61:45] chicken and egg situation or an in-group
[61:47] bias situation so it's possible there's
[61:50] a large untapped group of women
[61:53] bitcoiners out there who simply have
[61:55] never heard of you so they don't even
[61:57] know to get in touch with you um you
[62:00] know their AUD or the people who they
[62:02] talk to and your audience just doesn't
[62:05] have any overlaps yet so there's very
[62:07] very few ways that you can actually
[62:10] reach out to them um it's something I I
[62:12] I noticed especially for example if you
[62:13] were to look at uh Bitcoin Twitter so
[62:15] you look at um X as they call it now but
[62:18] okay I'm going to keep falling at
[62:19] Twitter um if you if you look at Bitcoin
[62:21] Twitter you could easily think that the
[62:23] vast majority of bitcoiners are these um
[62:26] you know young white Western right-wing
[62:29] men but the reality is not that so um
[62:34] it's more a case of how do we actually
[62:36] go out and find everybody else who isn't
[62:40] those people and actually let them be
[62:43] aware hey this is something you could be
[62:45] interested in maybe you know be on this
[62:48] show maybe just watch it become part of
[62:50] the audience um interact with it in some
[62:52] way um and how many of them will
[62:56] actually want to do that versus you know
[62:58] saying oh you know I've seen what
[63:00] Bitcoin social media is like I don't
[63:01] want to be a part of that at all so you
[63:04] know you get this kind of uh
[63:06] reinforcement Loop happening um and I
[63:08] think that's something we need to combat
[63:11] if we want Bitcoin to truly be for
[63:13] everyone um we need to stop um excluding
[63:17] people stop kind of pushing people out
[63:19] and it's not even deliberate exclusion
[63:21] you I don't think anybody are there are
[63:22] a few but very few people are saying you
[63:25] know hey we don't want these people in
[63:27] Bitcoin get rid of those people force
[63:29] them out there's not a lot of that most
[63:32] people say yeah Bitcoin is for everyone
[63:34] but I don't think we are in general
[63:36] doing enough to actually go out and find
[63:38] those people and bring them in and say
[63:40] hey take a look at this you know you
[63:42] could be interested in this um so I
[63:44] think that's where you know there is
[63:46] some work to be done 100% And and the
[63:50] the very very small part that I want to
[63:53] play is just giving as many people as
[63:55] possible audience uh with the podcast
[63:57] here that's why I have within one year
[64:00] now I've done it now one year and what
[64:03] is it seven days now my my podcast uh
[64:06] and you're my f
[64:08] 329th guest on the show uh and I had
[64:13] only I think 10 people two times on uh
[64:17] so it's actually like 300 over 300
[64:20] different guests probably even like more
[64:22] than that because sometimes I have like
[64:24] two or three guests at the same time on
[64:26] so uh it's probably like 340 uh
[64:30] different guests uh on my show uh and
[64:33] where I can actually go into those
[64:36] deeper regions and this wider regions uh
[64:38] and not just have Michael J sailor Jeff
[64:41] Bo Natalie prunell and the same kind of
[64:45] 30 people that on all all the podcasts
[64:48] on but have that wider range have the
[64:50] deeper range of just many interesting
[64:53] Bitcoins and that's actually a
[64:54] compliment I always get in not always
[64:58] but like regular get in in the comment
[65:00] section that my guest variety is just so
[65:02] huge because I do it seven times per
[65:05] weekend uh don't do solo episodes don't
[65:08] do uh repeated episodes all the time I
[65:10] see other podcasts that have the same
[65:12] guests on four times a year I'm like oh
[65:15] that's a lot yep no absolutely I think
[65:17] you that is a good thing to strive to do
[65:19] and uh yeah you know keep doing it
[65:21] absolutely thank you so much yeah will
[65:23] definitely do that um uh we are already
[65:26] approaching that one over the one hour
[65:28] Mark um what do you expect for 2025 and
[65:33] maybe with that um because we are kind
[65:36] of entering maybe a huge Bull Run uh
[65:40] what advice do you have for people that
[65:42] where this is their first real Bull Run
[65:45] they ended kind of after the 2021 Bull
[65:47] Run and what what what what do you
[65:49] suggest to people so yeah okay that's
[65:53] yeah two things so what I expect for
[65:55] this coming year 2025 is I expect to see
[65:58] a lot more Merchant adoption and you
[66:00] know I could say that just because it's
[66:02] my job at the moment uh you know I'm CTO
[66:04] at a company called musket we make um
[66:06] Merchant adoption Solutions um but
[66:10] beyond that I see a lot more a lot more
[66:14] people interested in the idea of using
[66:16] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange not just
[66:18] a store of value um so I think Merchants
[66:21] are going to pick up on that and as
[66:24] there is more demand there will be more
[66:26] acceptance um you know if enough people
[66:28] walk into a shop and say can I pay with
[66:30] Bitcoin at some point the shopkeeper is
[66:32] going to say yeah I should probably
[66:33] accept Bitcoin um so that I think will
[66:37] start to pick up a lot um in the next
[66:40] year and my advice to people in general
[66:44] is um don't look at the exchange rate as
[66:49] much as you probably do at the moment um
[66:52] the exchange rate of Bitcoin is
[66:54] incredibly volatile in the short term
[66:56] and pretty smoothly and steadily going
[66:59] up over the long term um so don't worry
[67:03] so much about you hey my net worth is
[67:06] now this in Euro my net worth is now
[67:07] that in Euro it's it's kind of a
[67:10] meaningless thing um what you should
[67:13] care about is what are the properties of
[67:16] Bitcoin that are meaningful to you so
[67:19] for me it's the fact that I can send a
[67:22] transaction to anyone who I choose to at
[67:25] any time I choose to without the asking
[67:29] permission from somebody else that to me
[67:31] is the reason that I'm a bitcoiner
[67:33] that's the most important thing um and
[67:37] all of the other things around that
[67:38] certainly help you know there are other
[67:41] um projects which theoretically allow
[67:42] that kind of thing but they have other
[67:44] negative properties uh you know like
[67:45] centralized control of some kind or um
[67:48] you know maybe really bad monetary
[67:50] policies so that's the reason I find
[67:52] Bitcoin valuable and therefore for me
[67:55] somebody else is interested in those
[67:57] same things they should go out and try
[67:59] it make some Bitcoin transactions you
[68:01] know find a shop near you go to BTC
[68:03] map.org find a shop that accepts Bitcoin
[68:06] get yourself a lightning wallet or
[68:08] whatever and then go and buy yourself
[68:10] bread rolls or a beer or a meal or
[68:12] whatever else with Bitcoin just do it
[68:14] once to try it and feel how it works get
[68:17] an idea of a real world use case because
[68:20] I think so many people look at it from
[68:22] the theoretical side and say oh okay I
[68:24] get how it works I've learned it in
[68:27] theory but they've never actually gone
[68:29] out and just bought something using
[68:30] Bitcoin um so I think that's something
[68:33] more people should do and really
[68:36] understand it at a more personal level
[68:38] that's that's really good I think it
[68:41] will also push a Bitcoin adoption uh
[68:44] really really uh good forward if we
[68:47] exactly do that uh with like medium of
[68:50] exchange adoption and it it educates
[68:52] people and that's something that's where
[68:54] like the next phase Cas of of Bitcoin
[68:57] really comes in uh yeah really cool we
[68:59] have always one question at the end of
[69:01] the podcast like two questions but one
[69:05] that is always the same question uh what
[69:07] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin so
[69:12] um I have many many interests many many
[69:15] uh talents without wanting to you know
[69:17] make myself sound too great but um I've
[69:19] learned a lot of things in my life I'm
[69:21] not young anymore um I'm in my mid-40s
[69:24] um and and I've studied a wide variety
[69:27] of things I I've studied like formerly
[69:30] Neuroscience I've studied Linguistics um
[69:32] I've studied a bunch of different things
[69:36] um I'm actually weirdly enough I'm a
[69:38] licensed and qualified private
[69:40] investigator in the state of New South
[69:41] Wales Australia um weird story how that
[69:44] happened not for today but uh yeah so
[69:46] I've I've looked at a lot of different
[69:48] things and one of the things that I
[69:52] always come back to is um how do people
[69:56] organize themselves and why so that's
[69:58] kind of my main passion um aside from
[70:01] Bitcoin itself obviously it hugely
[70:02] intersect with Bitcoin but uh that
[70:06] political idea of um
[70:09] self-organization um anarchism in
[70:11] general uh you know I think that's kind
[70:13] of the biggest thing that I probably
[70:14] have to teach people outside of the
[70:16] Bitcoin
[70:18] space that's great uh I think uh from
[70:21] that we can learn a lot actually really
[70:23] cool perfect then we come to the end of
[70:25] the podcast where the previous guest is
[70:27] asking a question for the next guest
[70:28] without knowing who the next guest
[70:30] actually is and uh we kind of touched on
[70:33] it a little bit but it would be
[70:35] interesting to know how this will go um
[70:39] do you believe that Europe countries
[70:42] will also start a strategic Bitcoin
[70:45] Reserve yes but it will take a while I
[70:47] think European countries in general are
[70:52] um much more difficult to get anything
[70:55] interesting and different happening um
[71:00] it's one of the advant or it's one of
[71:02] the disadvantages of an otherwise
[71:04] advantageous thing um European countries
[71:07] tend to have mixed member parliaments so
[71:09] parliaments that are a mix of all of the
[71:11] different political parties that were
[71:13] voted for just in different uh
[71:14] representational percentages um and that
[71:18] makes it really difficult for big
[71:19] changes to happen that is often an
[71:22] advantage because you don't want big
[71:23] changes to happen but it can be
[71:25] disadvantage for things like this you
[71:27] know um should a if a if you want a
[71:29] country to actually be more involved in
[71:30] Bitcoin um in Europe that's a very
[71:33] difficult thing to do because you're
[71:34] going to have this huge argument and not
[71:37] enough votes and all that kind of thing
[71:39] um inside the
[71:40] parliament perhaps a more interesting
[71:43] take on it though is do I think
[71:45] countries should have strategic Bitcoin
[71:47] reserves and actually I'm going to say
[71:50] no I actually don't think they should um
[71:53] because I don't like countries and I
[71:54] want countries to disappear I think
[71:57] countries are a bad idea I think humans
[71:59] can organize themselves much better
[72:01] without having states without having
[72:04] borders artificially drawn by
[72:06] centralized Powers
[72:08] so if countries have strategic Bitcoin
[72:11] reserves they're going to last longer I
[72:14] don't want them to so yeah they
[72:16] shouldn't do it I I think I said it once
[72:19] on the podcast where it's like it's
[72:21] actually more bullish that Germany sold
[72:23] 50,000 Bitcoin than rather than America
[72:27] will buy 1 million Bitcoin because I
[72:29] don't want America to have Bitcoin I
[72:31] want to have the people uh to have
[72:34] Bitcoin so yeah that that's a that's a
[72:36] great Point uh and and people are
[72:38] cheering for like micr strategy buy more
[72:40] Bitcoin and for counties to buy more
[72:42] Bitcoin I'm like like what who do you
[72:45] cheer for now yeah I want the people to
[72:48] have it not these uh you know
[72:50] governments and government created
[72:52] entities um and I I use that phrase very
[72:54] carefully by the way
[72:55] corporations exist because governments
[72:58] want them to exist so a corporation is
[73:00] just as much a government entity as um
[73:03] you know a government itself um despite
[73:05] the fact that on paper it's a private
[73:07] thing it's not corporations are not
[73:09] private things at all they're government
[73:11] things and it it shows us kind of that
[73:14] people um look too much at the price
[73:17] because they wouldn't cheer for America
[73:20] to buy Bitcoin if they wouldn't look at
[73:22] the price I presume I 100% agree with
[73:26] that yeah really cool uh perfect then
[73:29] yeah thank you so much uh Ben for for
[73:31] being on the show before I let you go
[73:33] where can people find you reach out to
[73:34] you ask your questions yep so um I'm on
[73:37] most social media just as benore Deval
[73:40] so my first name then underscore and my
[73:42] last name that's um telegram
[73:45] Twitter I think I'm on things like blue
[73:48] sky and so on but I don't actually use
[73:50] it um but I probably have an account
[73:52] there um and of course nosto um you uh
[73:56] you can find me there as well so yeah
[73:58] that's uh where you can find me um I
[74:01] also uh do I have a small consultancy
[74:04] company um called Bitcoin or Consulting
[74:06] that's bitcoiner consulting.com um but
[74:09] as I mentioned earlier I'm actually
[74:10] pretty much uh working full-time as CTO
[74:13] for a company called musket right now so
[74:15] I don't actually have any uh slots open
[74:18] to consult people on bitcoin right now
[74:20] so they they can reach out to you but
[74:22] they don't get a slot yeah maybe maybe
[74:25] something very small like a one hour
[74:27] appointment to teach someone something
[74:29] or whatever but uh yeah perfect uh that
[74:33] that that's uh that's great um wait what
[74:37] yeah uh thank you so much exactly that's
[74:40] what I wanted to point out uh your
