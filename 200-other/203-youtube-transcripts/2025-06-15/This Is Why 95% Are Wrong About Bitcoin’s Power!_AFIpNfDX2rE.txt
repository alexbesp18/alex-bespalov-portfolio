[00:00] Bitcoin has helped me to refocus on the
[00:02] 80% you know and people that I wouldn't
[00:05] have spoken to five ten years ago just
[00:08] because of like my superficial belief of
[00:11] like who they are or what their beliefs
[00:13] must be. People can remit money now to
[00:16] family members around the world. People
[00:18] can purchase items for family around the
[00:21] world through Bitcoin. And I think it
[00:23] enables us also to take back more
[00:26] control of our lives and to engage in
[00:29] peer-to-peer local economies. I mean,
[00:32] the idea of exchanging peer-to-peer puts
[00:34] us back in touch with each other. The
[00:36] vast majority or 80% or more of people
[00:38] really are are trend followers. They're
[00:40] not trend setters. that audience
[00:42] laughter in the background is uh
[00:45] representative of the 95% of the world
[00:48] still that um either hasn't heard about
[00:50] Bitcoin or you know is easily convinced
[00:54] that you know Bitcoin is is is like
[00:56] Beanie Babies and that comfortable world
[00:58] of trust in banks and full faith in
[01:01] credit.
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] Let's get started with what you are
[01:08] doing with Bitcoin circular economies.
[01:11] uh and and what's kind of your your uh
[01:14] background and overview? Sure. Um so I
[01:18] have a few roles in the global Bitcoin
[01:20] space. One of them is um as the
[01:23] coordinator for a global group called
[01:26] the Federation of Bitcoin Circular
[01:28] Economies. Um and when we met in El
[01:30] Salvador, I was there under under
[01:34] um that sort of umbrella of work that I
[01:37] do. uh the bitcoin um the federation of
[01:40] bitcoin circular economies was
[01:42] established um about 2 years ago. Uh
[01:45] there were a group of us who identified
[01:47] the need to help uh emerging and
[01:50] existing circular economies around the
[01:52] world connect with each other, share
[01:54] with each other uh and to provide um a
[01:56] bit of a a central spot for any
[02:00] community that wants to start a circular
[02:01] economy to to go and get support and get
[02:05] connected to to other circular
[02:07] economies. Um and that's something that
[02:10] that I had um you know created or
[02:13] established a couple of years ago after
[02:16] having conversations with with some of
[02:18] the existing circular economies in El
[02:19] Salvador and South Africa and elsewhere
[02:22] um because I saw a connection between
[02:24] the work that they're doing and the work
[02:25] that I had come from doing um you know
[02:29] for for 20 years in community health and
[02:31] development. Um, I'd been working with
[02:34] community health centers around the
[02:35] world, uh, which are community
[02:37] development projects trying to connect
[02:39] people with local health services and
[02:41] other sorts of supports and doing local
[02:43] community development work to, you know,
[02:45] improve, um, conditions for health and
[02:48] well-being in the local communities um,
[02:51] and you know really helping to provide
[02:53] connective tissue between those
[02:54] organizations around the world. And as I
[02:57] started to see the work um really
[03:00] inspiring work that community health
[03:02] that or sorry that uh Bitcoin and
[03:04] circular economies were were doing which
[03:06] by my count is really community
[03:08] development work right it's community
[03:10] development empowerment work um noted
[03:13] that there wasn't uh enough there wasn't
[03:15] much there wasn't enough sort of
[03:17] connective tissue between them so they
[03:19] could share lessons learn from each
[03:21] other um you know and also you know not
[03:24] reinvent the wheel around the work that
[03:27] they're doing like you know borrow and
[03:29] adapt what each other is doing and u you
[03:32] know so I approached a few of them
[03:33] started having conversations and um we
[03:36] just went from there. Um at this point
[03:39] you know fast forward a couple of years
[03:41] there are about 50 to 60 Bitcoin
[03:43] circular economies that that are
[03:45] connected through the federation. Um and
[03:49] you know we bring them together every
[03:51] couple of months for a a a general
[03:54] assembly virtually to you know share
[03:57] updates, learn from each other, get
[03:59] connected and and then offline you know
[04:03] uh different types of of project work.
[04:07] um you know based on on their local
[04:09] needs and and helping them advance their
[04:12] efforts around local education, merchant
[04:14] adoption and so forth.
[04:17] Super interesting. Uh it's I I love
[04:22] circle economist so much because it
[04:24] promotes
[04:25] um the medium of exchange side of things
[04:28] and uh I just uh had the the um episode
[04:34] with Jeff Boo. So that's the previous
[04:36] one. Uh and we talked about that. Uh and
[04:39] and he puts it out so clear. I'm I'm a
[04:43] little fearful if if in pointing it so
[04:46] clear, but but it's it's really
[04:48] encouraging to to see him putting it so
[04:50] clear where he says without meaning of
[04:53] exchange side of of Bitcoin store of
[04:57] value will fail of of Bitcoin. We need
[04:59] the med of exchange side of things. So
[05:02] um why do you think um circular
[05:05] economies and and this is the medium
[05:07] exchange side of things for for Bitcoin
[05:09] is so important? Yeah. And and I think
[05:12] um based on our local realities, we all
[05:16] um give priority to one or the other at
[05:20] at at first, you know, you and I living
[05:22] in countries like uh uh it is Austria,
[05:25] right? It's not Germany, it's Austria.
[05:27] Correct. It's a small small town of
[05:30] Germany. So like it's it's Austria. No,
[05:32] no, no. I I made a joke, but it's it's
[05:34] Austria. Yeah. So because
[05:38] because Austria is smaller than for
[05:41] example Bavaria um and it's it's a part
[05:44] of Germany but yeah it's it is Austria
[05:47] but what's the difference? You're you're
[05:49] German. You're Germany light just like
[05:51] Canada is uh USA light I guess and I
[05:54] lived in in I lived in Germany for two
[05:56] years uh in the part that is almost like
[05:59] Austria Bavaria uh it it's it's very
[06:02] nice but yeah but sorry yeah I'm
[06:04] Austrian I was going to say you know in
[06:06] Canada um Austria Germany United States
[06:09] where we have generally functioning um
[06:13] uh financial rails where you know the
[06:15] the uh median income, access to
[06:19] employment, etc. are generally better.
[06:24] Um, you know, obviously Bitcoin as
[06:26] medium of exchange is not as easy for
[06:28] people to grasp because our currencies
[06:30] are stronger. Um, you know, relative,
[06:34] yes. Yes, they're they're debasing and
[06:36] and and people's purchasing power is
[06:38] diminishing, no doubt. But you know
[06:40] compared to something you know like the
[06:43] uh uh uh you know like uh um the Kenyan
[06:48] shilling or you know other other
[06:50] currencies uh Turkish lera others that
[06:53] are debasing much more rapidly we don't
[06:55] have the need for it to the extent that
[06:57] you know many other places in the world
[06:59] do and so for us for the majority of
[07:01] people the the store of value is is
[07:04] going to be the first case. Now when you
[07:07] look to the majority of the world where
[07:10] you have much weaker currencies that are
[07:12] debasing at a much um much faster pace
[07:17] where there are all sorts of capital
[07:18] controls uh where gaining access to
[07:22] banking and financial rails that allow
[07:24] you to save money in a third-party
[07:27] entity to transact digitally uh are much
[07:30] more difficult to come by. you know, the
[07:32] medium of exchange is a really powerful
[07:35] case and I think it's just is is is
[07:38] evident. Um, so I would say starting
[07:40] from that, uh, the medium of exchange
[07:43] value and use of of of Bitcoin is really
[07:46] filling a massive gap for much of much
[07:49] of the world. you know, you've you've
[07:50] seen places, no doubt, and spoken to
[07:52] people places, no doubt, um who prior to
[07:56] um having access to Bitcoin lived
[07:59] entirely on on a cash basis. Um at a
[08:04] local level, uh if you're somewhere
[08:07] where you're based in a cash economy,
[08:10] not only is access to the currency a
[08:13] challenge, but there there are physical
[08:15] safety concerns. Um there are concerns
[08:18] with you know how do you um you know as
[08:21] a small business uh or a household h how
[08:24] do you transact in in ways using your
[08:26] local currency that you know make life
[08:29] more manageable um etc. All sorts of
[08:32] barriers to you know to to to
[08:35] transacting and so having a digital
[08:37] currency that anyone can hold on their
[08:39] on their phone and as you know doesn't
[08:41] even need to be a um a smartphone. We
[08:44] have Machankura based out of out of out
[08:46] of South Africa and on the African
[08:47] continent and that others around the
[08:49] world are now using where you can
[08:51] actually use a quoteunquote dumb phone
[08:52] to to to transact over just a normal mo
[08:56] mobile line. Um, I mean this just helps
[08:59] people leapfrog
[09:01] um a generation of technology and and
[09:05] gives them not only a better means of of
[09:08] transacting on a peer-to-peer and
[09:10] peer-to-pis uh network locally, but
[09:12] actually gives them access to global
[09:15] markets and the global community where
[09:18] prior to that they were completely cut
[09:20] off by virtue of transacting in a in a
[09:24] in a a local currency um that no outside
[09:27] of their own borders would would want.
[09:30] Um and and so, you know, from for
[09:33] starters, it's it's really bringing
[09:36] um that half or more of the planet that
[09:40] is entirely cut off from the rest of the
[09:43] world. um and are scrambling for their
[09:45] lives literally on a daily and weekly
[09:47] basis to keep up um you know with with
[09:51] the rising costs of of of living which
[09:55] are owing to their debasing currencies
[09:58] by and large um just a new lease on
[10:01] life. Um, and so that medium of exchange
[10:04] value of of Bitcoin um is is incredibly
[10:09] powerful for that, you know, half or
[10:12] more of the world's po population, just
[10:15] for
[10:16] starters. Um, second of all, I mean, I
[10:19] think even for those of us living in
[10:22] countries with more quote unquote
[10:25] developed financial rails, banking
[10:27] systems, um, uh, monetary policy,
[10:30] government
[10:32] uh management of finances that isn't as
[10:34] as
[10:35] as terrible as it is in in many other
[10:38] places of of of the world. Um that
[10:41] medium of exchange still gives us a
[10:43] tremendous amount of power, right? And I
[10:46] think it it it also helps us to connect
[10:48] to the rest of the world in places that
[10:51] um that previously weren't possible or
[10:54] where there were, you know, significant
[10:56] barriers. Um and so just providing that
[10:59] connectivity to the rest of the world
[11:01] and being part of a global movement um
[11:04] is really you know really people can
[11:06] remit money now to family members around
[11:09] the world. People can purchase items for
[11:11] family around the around the world
[11:14] through um through through Bitcoin. And
[11:17] I think it enables us also to take back
[11:21] more control of our lives and to engage
[11:24] in peer-to-peer local economies here in
[11:28] ways that support small businesses that
[11:30] support, you know, independent
[11:32] regenerative uh local farmers that uh
[11:36] enable us to claw back some of the the
[11:39] power from major corporations that, you
[11:44] know, have have squeezed out. um smaller
[11:47] businesses uh often in concert with you
[11:51] know governments whose regulation or
[11:54] lack of regulation have have uh really
[11:59] um you know given power to larger
[12:03] entities. Um, so I think those are just
[12:06] a a few of the the ways that, you know,
[12:09] the use of Bitcoin as money
[12:12] um really, you know, the people's money
[12:15] gives back power to everyday people, to
[12:19] families, to local communities. um
[12:22] obviously with different priorities,
[12:24] different uh senses of urgency from one
[12:27] location to the next around the world,
[12:28] but um really shifts those the the the
[12:32] power back towards us, you know,
[12:35] everyday people. Super interesting the
[12:36] the social and the the cultural impact
[12:40] that that also Bitcoin uh will have will
[12:44] have on on us. And I'm often wondering
[12:46] like how this this long term will
[12:49] actually impact. you already gave some
[12:51] some kind of insights that the power
[12:53] shifts back to to us and to the to the
[12:56] individual. Um what what do you think is
[12:59] the impact of having peer-to-peer cash
[13:03] uh with with Bitcoin uh on a cultural or
[13:07] or social layer for for humanity? Yeah,
[13:10] I I mean still early days. Um but I I
[13:14] think Bitcoin period because it is a
[13:16] final settlement uh or bearer asset
[13:20] because um uh you know
[13:24] one unless one is using like a custodied
[13:27] service one really has to be accountable
[13:29] for one's uh one's own wallet one's keys
[13:33] etc. Um it really does um increase you
[13:37] know the the prioritize you know
[13:40] personal responsibility and ownership of
[13:43] of one's personal finances and um for a
[13:46] group perhaps the group's finances etc
[13:49] and and um I I think that that causes
[13:53] a a a cognitive shift for people and it
[13:57] is a gateway to people actually
[13:59] exploring
[14:00] um you know autonomy sovereignty
[14:04] uh responsibility for for for self in
[14:06] many other ways. So I I think that
[14:09] there's a powerful sort of fundamental
[14:12] um value of of Bitcoin in that sense.
[14:17] Um, in addition to that, I mean, the
[14:21] idea of exchanging peer-to-peer,
[14:23] um, it puts us back in touch with with
[14:26] with each other, and it it I think it
[14:30] causes us to engage and re-engage in
[14:34] ways uh, that aren't strictly like
[14:38] functional. you know, the way you go
[14:39] into a big store and um or or transact
[14:44] online and and you don't really have a a
[14:47] personal connection to the person you're
[14:49] engaging with, the the the the person
[14:51] who's uh providing you your you know,
[14:54] your your uh uh your meat or your
[14:57] produce or your other good or or or
[15:01] service. Um, in the fiat world, I I I
[15:04] find things have become much more
[15:06] transactional and, you know, functional.
[15:09] Um, and this might just be a um a
[15:13] product of of, you know, how early we
[15:15] are with Bitcoin and um the fact that,
[15:18] you know, there is a um there's a a
[15:21] countercultural or subcultural element
[15:24] to using Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer basis
[15:26] still in much of the world. Uh, but
[15:28] there's a different quality to our
[15:30] engagement with each other on a
[15:31] peer-to-peer basis. I I think so. I I've
[15:34] experienced and I've heard, you know,
[15:35] secondhand from a lot of people just how
[15:37] it gives there's just a a different
[15:38] quality to the type of engagement you
[15:41] have when you're paying someone for a
[15:43] service, when you're buying a good or
[15:44] service um from from them in in many
[15:48] respects. Um, so I I think it does sort
[15:51] of help to renew some of our, you know,
[15:54] connections
[15:56] um with each other. Now that will not
[15:59] persist if we you know if and once we
[16:01] you know go to scale with using Bitcoin
[16:05] as a as a medium of exchange and you
[16:07] know it's ubiquitous and you're using
[16:09] Bitcoin everywhere on daily on a daily
[16:11] basis that's a function of you know of
[16:14] uh just where we are in terms of the the
[16:15] adoption curve and use of Bitcoin as as
[16:18] money. But but at this point and at a
[16:21] point in time when we live in the world
[16:23] that that is just like so divisive when
[16:26] um when there's such systemic change and
[16:30] structural change um at uh a
[16:34] macroeconomic geopolitical uh level at
[16:37] the level of society where people are
[16:39] are pulled apart from each other through
[16:42] you know sort of toxic tribal political
[16:45] narratives and you know the
[16:47] gravitational pull of political parties
[16:49] etc. I think there's something powerful
[16:51] about um re-engaging each other on a
[16:54] peer-to-peer basis and and just that
[16:56] sort of level of human contact it it it
[16:59] it provides. Uh maybe I'm I I might be
[17:03] uh um you know I I might be thinking
[17:05] wishfully of that because I'd like to
[17:07] see more you know constructive social
[17:09] dialogue and engagement and whatnot.
[17:12] Um, you know, I I I think it does, um,
[17:15] you know, help to kind of restore
[17:18] some, you know, nicer quality to to to
[17:22] our engagements with each other.
[17:24] I I do think so, too. Uh, and, um, I I'm
[17:28] not in the camp that says Bitcoin will
[17:30] fix everything. uh and uh and uh because
[17:34] I think there are just things that
[17:38] Bitcoin maybe touches but it is not
[17:40] fully integrated. Uh but one thing that
[17:44] Bitcoin actually does is it gives the us
[17:47] the trust back in the money that we use
[17:50] because most people actually don't
[17:52] invest. They they just have the fiat
[17:55] money. uh and if the the fundamental
[17:57] basis of your life uh and your money is
[18:02] broken, you have a big distrust in the
[18:06] system uh and then you also have a big
[18:10] distrust in uh your life in general. So
[18:13] I think the disconnect between
[18:17] people is not only because of money but
[18:21] money is a big contribution point to
[18:23] that and if we can trust back in in our
[18:26] money I
[18:28] think the trust slowly can come back
[18:31] there's a room of that coming back there
[18:33] other factors why we uh are more devised
[18:37] uh I mean a lot of a lot of time I also
[18:41] think uh in in real life we're not as
[18:45] divided as it sometimes is portrayed on
[18:48] social media or TV. So I I I do see that
[18:53] uh when when I go to to family
[18:55] gatherings, when I go out with friends,
[18:58] uh pe people are not so divided. But
[19:02] also I'm in a small bubble. So we are
[19:05] all like even if you have a lot of
[19:08] friends and uh people that you know, how
[19:10] many can you really know? Like 100
[19:12] people, maybe 200, like that's a very
[19:14] small bubble that has like 8 billion
[19:16] people. So that's like even if you know
[19:18] a lot, you don't know a lot of people. I
[19:22] mean, one of the things that I I I I
[19:23] argue, and this is shifting a little bit
[19:25] more to to the work that I do in in
[19:28] Canada and my observations of the United
[19:30] States and and elsewhere, we see these,
[19:32] you know, the these these um uh social,
[19:36] economic, cultural divides and this sort
[19:39] of the way that that Bitcoin often gets
[19:42] caught in the middle of these partisan,
[19:44] tribal,
[19:46] um, you know, divides.
[19:49] having you know been part of that and
[19:52] coming from you know particular I guess
[19:55] I guess ideological political
[19:57] philosophical background you know myself
[20:01] for 20 30 years which has shifted um and
[20:04] and to a certain extent due to Bitcoin
[20:07] um but you know observing these these
[20:09] divides you know what I what I what I
[20:11] and then getting to know people better
[20:14] um what appears on the surface to be um
[20:17] a very real divide right, is actually
[20:21] misunderstanding. It's actually people
[20:23] using coded language and talking across
[20:26] each other and making large assumptions
[20:28] and and and assigning certain um beliefs
[20:32] and and and and assumed values and
[20:36] ideologies to the person on the other
[20:39] side or the group on the other side of
[20:41] that supposed divide. when you actually
[20:43] get to know them, they're actually
[20:45] closer together than than than appears
[20:48] on the surface, right? It's it's a
[20:49] disconnect due to broken language,
[20:53] um coded language, um and a lot of
[20:56] assumptions which are then fueled by the
[21:00] cultural caps, you know, and the tribes
[21:02] that that surround us where you're
[21:04] having these messages reinforced that
[21:06] those people over there believe this,
[21:08] are like this, want this, and and vice
[21:10] versa. But in fact, it's it's not true.
[21:13] I I really do believe that 80% of people
[21:16] can agree on about 80% of things. Um
[21:19] we're always pulled to the margins to
[21:21] fight over the 20%, we don't start from
[21:23] the 80%. And and and I and I've seen and
[21:26] and my personal experiences, Bitcoin has
[21:29] helped me to refocus on the 80%. you
[21:33] know, and people that I wouldn't have
[21:34] spoken to um 5 10 years ago just because
[21:39] of like my superficial
[21:41] um belief of like who they are or what
[21:45] their beliefs must be if they say that
[21:47] this is their voting tendency or that
[21:50] you know I've been able to sort of bring
[21:52] down those walls and be able to
[21:54] re-engage people on a human level and
[21:56] and realize that no actually we actually
[21:58] share a lot in common. There's some
[22:00] shared values. We just, you know, have
[22:03] been propped up against each other by
[22:05] these, you know, these powerful
[22:07] narrative structures that that that, you
[22:11] know, that that cause us to do that and
[22:14] reinforce those sorts of polarizing
[22:18] um sort of uses of language and and and
[22:20] and whatnot. But also
[22:23] um you know al also that um we just
[22:27] there aren't just many spaces anymore
[22:29] where we can actually have constructive
[22:31] dialogue, right? And like what do you
[22:32] mean when you say that? Is this what you
[22:34] mean? This is what I this is what I
[22:36] think you mean. Is that what you really
[22:38] mean? And um anyhow and I think I think
[22:41] Bitcoin is has given me um you know a
[22:45] sense that uh it is a tool that can help
[22:49] us to actually come together again. Very
[22:53] true. And uh the other the the the thing
[22:57] also with a globalized world with all
[23:01] its advantages there's those things
[23:03] coming. Uh if you look at feeds um uh it
[23:06] fields you always the most extreme uh in
[23:10] in the most extreme on the good side but
[23:12] also on the bad side. Uh and without
[23:15] social media without the globalized
[23:16] world you could only see the most
[23:18] extreme in your village in your country
[23:22] in your town. Uh and the most extreme in
[23:24] your town is most likely not the most
[23:26] extreme uh in in the whole world. So,
[23:30] uh, if we then see on Twitter some
[23:32] fighting videos where where people get
[23:34] off the car and and fight with each
[23:36] other, most of the time it's not
[23:38] happening. Most of the time people just
[23:40] drive around and have a good time. Uh,
[23:42] but there are those instances and those
[23:44] are where the cameras are then and then
[23:46] it lands on the internet. Uh so so
[23:49] that's that's that also an interesting
[23:50] these crime television shows right where
[23:52] where you know CSI Miami or CSI whatever
[23:55] whatever thing you you'd think that
[23:57] there are these really elaborate you
[23:59] know murders happening on a daily basis
[24:02] uh etc. But it's a it's a constructed or
[24:05] reconstructed reality right it doesn't
[24:07] give you a a true sense of of what life
[24:10] looks like and that that's the world we
[24:12] inhabit uh uh you know online and
[24:15] through social media. Absolutely. Um you
[24:18] said something uh in a sentence uh uh
[24:21] that we are really early in in in
[24:23] Bitcoin. Um how would you look at how
[24:27] early we we actually are like do you
[24:29] have do you have a framework to think
[24:31] around uh um where in in in the Bitcoin
[24:34] adoption we are? Yeah. Um I mean it's
[24:37] interesting when you hear people
[24:38] different people talk about you know
[24:40] what the rate of adoption is um
[24:43] globally. Um, and I think you have to
[24:45] like parse that out too when you say the
[24:46] rate of adoption. Rate of adoption,
[24:48] people investing in it. And if they're
[24:50] investing in it or holding it, are they
[24:52] holding it through, you know, a uh um a
[24:56] pro a product where they're not actually
[24:58] holding Bitcoin like an ETF or something
[25:00] like that or and then how many people
[25:02] are using it as money. Um and I mean I I
[25:06] would guess that you know the that the
[25:10] percentage of the global population that
[25:12] is is holding Bitcoin in self-custody to
[25:16] some extent whatever amount and is
[25:20] actually using it as a medium of
[25:22] exchange on a semi-regular basis. So,
[25:25] let's say even just once per month or
[25:28] something like that, like we're probably
[25:29] we're probably not even at like 1%. Say,
[25:34] you know, then when you add in people
[25:35] who excuse me, who don't use it as a
[25:38] medium exchange, but but hold it and
[25:40] people who hold it through ETFs and so
[25:41] forth, I don't know, maybe we're at 2
[25:43] 3%. So, that in and of itself, I think,
[25:47] you know, signifies that we're really
[25:49] early um when it comes to to to global
[25:52] adoption. Um, and you think if you think
[25:55] of what we've been able to accomplish
[25:56] and how how fast this global ecosystem
[26:01] has developed over the past 16 years um
[26:04] with just that little uh uh uh or small
[26:09] level of adoption like imagine what what
[26:11] happens when we double that when it goes
[26:13] from that let's say charitably 3% of the
[26:17] world has some contact with with
[26:19] Bitcoin. What happens when it goes to
[26:20] 6%. Right? which is which is still a
[26:24] small proportion of the of of the world.
[26:28] um you know just that that the network
[26:30] effect and the and the and the the the
[26:32] doubling effect that that uh that
[26:35] happens when it comes to the development
[26:37] of of the layer 2 three technologies,
[26:40] the the social layer, the the extent to
[26:43] which Bitcoin enters into, you know, the
[26:46] lexicon and and um and and and popular
[26:50] culture um and uh the life of
[26:56] corporations, not for profofit profit
[26:58] organizations,
[26:59] etc. I don't think we can I I don't
[27:02] think we can even even really wrap our
[27:03] minds around what that's what that's
[27:06] going to to look like.
[27:08] Um but uh you know to come back to the
[27:13] the the how I think about adoption at at
[27:17] at this point I'm sure um you know
[27:21] you're in the same boat when it comes to
[27:24] uh you know those normie friends of ours
[27:27] as we if we use that that that language
[27:29] you know the ones who see you as like
[27:31] that Bitcoin guy the Bitcoin guy or who
[27:33] who inserts the reference here or there
[27:36] or you turns a conversation about
[27:40] politics or economics or anything else
[27:43] sort of back to a Bitcoin angle from
[27:45] time to time.
[27:47] Um, you know, even people who have that
[27:50] sort of regular exposure to Bitcoin and
[27:53] that, hey, Bitcoin is maybe not just
[27:55] this magic internet money, this beanie
[27:57] baby, you know, Beanie Baby money or
[28:00] something for, you know, crypto bros,
[28:02] etc., and have you as a as a trusted
[28:05] sort of ambassador for it. I I'm I'm
[28:09] sure you're probably in the same boat as
[28:11] me where it's just a small percentage of
[28:13] the people that you have in your con in
[28:16] in your network who have that sort of
[28:18] regular contact with you who've
[28:19] actually, you know, taken the next step
[28:22] to educate themselves a little bit
[28:24] further and and and I think that sort of
[28:28] speaks to where we are in in in
[28:30] adoption. It's um the the um the the
[28:36] spell of our fiat money and the the the
[28:41] monetary and financial systems and
[28:43] structures.
[28:45] um you know that that surround us and
[28:47] have coddled us and you know have us in
[28:50] this comfortable state of of trust in
[28:54] third party institutions and and
[28:57] um you know accepting that you know
[29:00] inflation is is not just acceptable but
[29:04] is is perhaps even a a desirable
[29:07] um phenomenon of of like of our of our
[29:10] modern reality, right? and the newspaper
[29:13] articles and radio about you know Bank
[29:16] of Canada or Federal Reserve or Central
[29:18] Bank of Given country is going to meet
[29:20] today and and you know help make life
[29:23] better for us and steer us in the right
[29:25] direction. I think just the the the
[29:27] spell the magical spell of all of that
[29:31] um has people under such a trance that
[29:35] you know it's going to take a while to
[29:37] break it because there's work that that
[29:39] that that goes into it. But, you know,
[29:42] there's something about hitting a magic
[29:45] I should stop using that word, a a a
[29:47] critical threshold of, you know, maybe
[29:50] 1% to 2% where um you know, I think it
[29:54] just catapults us forward towards the
[29:57] next level because um uh you know, it
[30:00] will no longer be just one out of 10
[30:04] friends in a group that is the the the
[30:07] weirdo bitcoiner, but you know, once
[30:09] you've got two, then okay,
[30:12] you've you know you you you can't
[30:14] dismiss it as much that you know there's
[30:17] an increased um you know increased
[30:19] likelihood that then that third person
[30:22] will say uh well okay he's a weirdo or
[30:26] she's a weirdo and so many things I
[30:28] don't know this is just one of their
[30:29] weird things but them I I if they're
[30:33] taking an interest in it maybe I should
[30:35] too I just there there's so I I think
[30:38] about it in those terms that we're like
[30:40] on this slow march from 1% to 2% for
[30:45] instance and once we hit that 2% it it
[30:48] really will um accelerate. That's not at
[30:52] all grounded in in in evidence or data
[30:55] of any sort. That's more just a sort of
[30:57] anecdotal and feel for it as you have
[31:00] these conversations with people and
[31:02] observe and listen to, you know,
[31:05] podcasts and and whatnot. But it it
[31:08] feels like we're getting close to that
[31:11] tipping point um of going from like that
[31:14] one to two and and you know then going
[31:17] two to five will you know will will you
[31:22] know take the same time as it took to
[31:23] get from one to two. There's a great
[31:26] chart that um uh River actually put out
[31:31] uh and actually um covers covers your
[31:34] your story really good because you also
[31:36] talked about 3% adoption. Uh and it's a
[31:39] fairly new one. Uh they made it
[31:42] definitely in 205. I just discovered it
[31:44] actually today. Uh they probably put it
[31:46] out a few days ago, something like that.
[31:49] Um, and it's super hard for me to find
[31:53] out where in adoption we are because
[31:55] like what numbers are you looking at?
[31:57] Who is a Bitcoiner? Who's not a
[31:58] Bitcoiner? Like if you have 5% in
[32:00] Bitcoin, are you already counting as a
[32:02] bitcoiner? Uh, but so those are numbers
[32:06] which we have to just to to work with.
[32:09] And when we compare it to uh the
[32:12] internet in 1990, I always thought we we
[32:15] are already in like 1995 or something
[32:17] like that. uh but we actually not uh
[32:20] online banking uh and and also social
[32:23] media a little bit more recently. Uh
[32:26] that's just uh tremendous when we when
[32:28] we see that and uh when you think back
[32:32] of those innovations for example the
[32:35] internet in 1990 um we couldn't imagine
[32:39] anything that came from the internet
[32:42] that we are now experiencing or already
[32:44] experienced like 10 years ago. So, which
[32:47] makes me super excited of like what is a
[32:50] Bitcoin world looking like in 10, 20, 30
[32:52] years. Uh we we we just have no clue
[32:56] what uh things are being developed. And
[32:58] I think that that that's a really
[33:00] valuable um comparison, right? I mean, I
[33:03] I think um Bitcoiners of, you know, most
[33:06] of us who kind of tune in to to content
[33:08] out there have seen the um you know, the
[33:11] interviews between David Letterman and
[33:13] Bill Gates talking about the internet
[33:15] and and and computers and um just how,
[33:19] you know, he's being um made fun of for
[33:22] suggesting, you know, that that uh the
[33:25] personal computers and the internet are
[33:27] going to be transformative. And there's,
[33:29] you know, Paul Kugman from the New York
[33:30] Times who um, you know, who professed
[33:34] that, uh, you know, the internet would
[33:36] amount to nothing more than than the fax
[33:38] machine did and so forth. And so we at
[33:40] least have a mental model, you know, to
[33:43] to apply in terms of of imagining, you
[33:49] know, that there is some world that we
[33:51] can't
[33:53] fully, you know, define or or or or, you
[33:56] know, populate. um in terms of what it's
[33:59] going to look like um from now and you
[34:02] know 20 years 20 years forward. But if
[34:04] we apply that comparison of the internet
[34:07] and knowing what it was like in the '9s
[34:10] to today, um it it it it should help us
[34:14] to have confidence
[34:16] um in you know what happens to network
[34:21] effect technologies
[34:23] um and especially when they're they're
[34:25] they're things like the internet and
[34:27] Bitcoin when that that truly apply on a
[34:30] global scale. Let's take a break for a
[34:32] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[34:35] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[34:38] watches. Those watches are the most
[34:41] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[34:44] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[34:47] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:50] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:53] watch collections. You have the date of
[34:56] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[34:59] there and of course also the block
[35:01] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:04] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:07] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:10] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:12] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:15] love those watches so so much. And now
[35:18] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:21] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:23] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:25] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[35:27] first way is you put it on a hardware
[35:29] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[35:32] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[35:35] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[35:38] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[35:41] if you check out the link in the
[35:42] description, you even get 5% off if you
[35:45] use the code Robin. And the second way
[35:48] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:51] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:54] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[35:57] They will personalize for you a
[36:00] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:02] your individual situation. They will
[36:05] show you how you can secure your own
[36:08] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:10] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:12] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:14] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:17] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:20] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:22] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:25] last but not least, if you're in a
[36:26] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[36:29] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[36:31] that, head over to the
[36:35] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:38] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:41] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:43] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:46] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:49] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:51] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:53] the link down in the description of
[36:56] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:58] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:02] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:03] there. I have the video actually uh
[37:06] maybe we can watch it because I think
[37:08] it's a it's a brilliant one. It's from
[37:09] 1995. And let me quickly figure out how
[37:12] to set everything up so we can actually
[37:14] watch it nicely. So you also hear it. Uh
[37:16] I hope you also hear it uh on on your
[37:19] side. Now um and this is Bill Bill Gates
[37:22] explaining the this internet thing. It's
[37:24] I think it's just like a few seconds
[37:26] long actually.
[37:27] What about this internet thing? Do you
[37:29] do you know anything about that? Sure.
[37:31] What what the hell is that exactly?
[37:34] Well, it's it's become a place where
[37:36] people are publishing information. So
[37:38] everybody can have their own homepage.
[37:40] Companies are there, the latest
[37:42] information. It's wild what's going on.
[37:44] You can send electronic mail to people.
[37:47] Uh it is the big new thing. Yeah. But
[37:49] you know, uh it's easy to criticize
[37:51] something you don't fully understand,
[37:53] which is my position here. Go ahead. But
[37:54] I I can remember a couple of months ago
[37:57] there was like a big breakthrough
[37:58] announcement that on the internet or on
[38:00] some computer deal they were going to
[38:02] broadcast a a baseball game. You could
[38:04] listen to a baseball game on your
[38:06] computer. And I just thought to myself,
[38:09] does radio ring a bell?
[38:14] You know what I mean? It's just
[38:18] and I think it shows so nicely of like
[38:21] uh how people actually thought about
[38:22] that previously and uh it it reminds me
[38:26] so much of what people bring up with
[38:28] count arguments now against Bitcoin.
[38:31] Yeah. Well, and if you hear the audience
[38:33] applause in the background too, which is
[38:35] not merely, you know, like the canned
[38:37] laughter of a of a of a late night
[38:40] comedy show, people applauding for, you
[38:43] know, a good joke, etc.,
[38:45] you know, and I might be reaching here a
[38:47] little bit, but but I I I read into
[38:50] that, you know, people
[38:52] um people in enjoying the fact that
[38:56] David Letterman in his position there
[38:58] are affirming for them their biases,
[39:01] right? And providing some assurance that
[39:03] the world as they know it, you know, the
[39:06] tool that they know it will not change
[39:08] because we're resistant to change,
[39:10] right? And and and the vast majority of
[39:12] people, and I don't mean this to sound
[39:14] condescending, the vast majority or 80%
[39:17] or more of people really are are trend
[39:19] followers. They're not trend setters.
[39:22] Right? There's that that adoption curve.
[39:24] There's a reason why, you know, there's
[39:26] one 5 10% early adopters on that curve
[39:29] who um are often um you know, not just
[39:34] adopting a technology or tool, but are
[39:37] part of a a cult a countercultural
[39:39] trend. There's a reason why um I think
[39:43] in this early phase of Bitcoin adoption
[39:46] for instance you know we had the cyber
[39:48] cyberpunks right and we've had the um
[39:52] you know libertarians and we've had you
[39:55] know the carnivore maxis and others who
[39:59] you know are making broader declarations
[40:02] about Bitcoin and its role in civil
[40:04] society and and and making uh political
[40:08] and social um declarations about about
[40:12] Bitcoin that fit into, you know, a a
[40:16] countercultural
[40:18] um narrative um because, you know,
[40:22] people who are earlier on adoption
[40:24] curve, you know, are are going against
[40:27] bigger trends in in in some respects and
[40:30] and and I think, you know, that audience
[40:32] laughter in the background is, you know,
[40:35] uh representative of the 95% of the
[40:38] world still that um either hasn't heard
[40:41] about Bitcoin or you know is easily
[40:43] convinced that you know Bitcoin is is is
[40:46] like Beanie Babies and um and that the
[40:49] comfortable well not comfortable for
[40:51] everyone but you know just for all
[40:53] intents and purposes that comfortable
[40:56] world of of of trust in banks and full
[40:59] faith in credit uh um and fiat money is
[41:04] you know going to be a permanent you
[41:06] know feature of the world we inhabit and
[41:09] and we're gradually
[41:12] eroding this you know that audience in
[41:15] in at that show I'm sure if there were
[41:18] you know a hundred people for the sake
[41:19] of argument in that audience there was
[41:22] one who went home and looked up the
[41:25] internet and became a convert right and
[41:28] then that person told someone and they
[41:30] told someone and it's that's just the
[41:32] pace of the pace of change it's So
[41:37] there's two. So first I want to get
[41:40] there. Um uh I had uh I I was in
[41:44] university in Austria uh for um IT once
[41:48] and for economics. Uh and for the IT I
[41:51] had a s course of IT security. uh and
[41:54] that IT security course uh the
[41:57] introduction of it within the first 10
[42:00] minutes he talked bad about Bitcoin
[42:03] which like was not even on the topic. I
[42:07] don't know. He I think he just picked
[42:09] his personal battle against Bitcoin. Uh
[42:13] and there was no need uh for punching
[42:17] bag because there's lots of material out
[42:19] there to to to to confirm one's bias,
[42:22] right? If one looks at the terrible, you
[42:25] know, environmental takes about Bitcoin
[42:27] or one looks at like the headlines from
[42:29] take your uh take your pick of of
[42:32] of credentialed journalists
[42:36] uh or or economists etc. Right. That
[42:38] that just easily confirm one one's bias.
[42:42] You don't need to like to to to to dig
[42:45] any deeper. Sorry to interrupt you.
[42:47] Yeah. No, no, no, no worries. But it's a
[42:49] it's a great point because it is a very
[42:51] easing punching point and also it's a
[42:55] you you you never attack a person with
[42:57] that. If if you attack Bitcoin uh like
[43:00] there's literally no person behind
[43:01] Bitcoin. There's no uh organization. So
[43:05] it's actually something uh if you want
[43:07] to attack something like attack that
[43:09] one. Uh but the point that I'm was
[43:11] trying to make
[43:12] was he was attacking Bitcoin within 10
[43:16] minutes without anyone that actually ask
[43:19] a question about Bitcoin with anyone
[43:21] that actually took interest in that and
[43:23] it was not something uh that was at that
[43:26] moment necessary. Uh and my takeaway
[43:31] from that was okay he talked about
[43:33] Bitcoin
[43:35] uh to an audience of like I don't know
[43:36] like 500 students or something like
[43:38] that. it was was a a smaller room uh
[43:41] where 500 students were in there uh and
[43:44] most of them probably didn't really pay
[43:46] attention and like okay maybe bitcoin is
[43:48] a bad thing but it's just the same thing
[43:49] that I heard in the in the newspaper
[43:51] anyways uh it was not really grounded in
[43:53] in any other argument but as you said in
[43:57] that audience there were maybe 100
[43:59] people and one was like oh let's let me
[44:00] look up that internet thing in in that
[44:03] university there definitely one two
[44:05] people are like oh maybe I don't know
[44:07] why why did talk about Bitcoin like
[44:10] let's look it up and then the the Google
[44:12] and then the thing find something and
[44:14] maybe he he finds the right article
[44:17] maybe the wrong article uh let's see but
[44:21] uh you you you cannot make bad like
[44:24] there there is such a thing as bad
[44:27] advertisement but attacking Bitcoin only
[44:30] makes it stronger over time
[44:33] yeah that's the I think the the strian
[44:36] effect it's called right where the mere
[44:37] mention of of of something um you know
[44:41] providing promotion to something um
[44:44] provides an you know an audience with an
[44:47] opening to actually learn learn about it
[44:50] and so the initial impact might be
[44:52] negative. It it actually you know opens
[44:56] up the the door um to to to people
[45:00] learning learning about it. Um, and I I
[45:03] mean I take comfort in
[45:06] um, you know, there are so many truisms
[45:09] in, you know, in Bitcoin, the Bitcoin
[45:11] world, and the things that people people
[45:13] say. Um uh but you know when I
[45:17] hear people on different continents
[45:21] coming from different social and
[45:24] economic backgrounds
[45:26] um all talking about you know their
[45:29] unique you know Bitcoin learning journey
[45:32] that rabbit and their their their rabbit
[45:34] hole story um etc. and arriving at
[45:39] similar conclusions that you know yes
[45:42] it's complicated to you know get over
[45:44] the initial learning hump and to you
[45:48] know why the the fear uncertainty and
[45:50] doubt um that are planted through
[45:52] mainstream media articles and um and
[45:55] those you know those um you know those
[45:59] lowhanging fruit jokes about about
[46:02] Bitcoin like why those are you know
[46:05] incorrect
[46:07] Um but but that once you do like it's a
[46:11] one-way journey. People don't people
[46:13] don't un people people don't become
[46:15] Bitcoiners and then turn back right you
[46:18] don't um study Bitcoin for you know 10
[46:22] 20 or more or more hours and and grasp
[46:24] you know fundamental concepts and then
[46:26] say yeah but I guess this isn't for me
[46:28] or or you know that that um that this is
[46:32] incorrect.
[46:34] consuming more and more information to
[46:37] either um you know either either carve
[46:40] away at some of the the lingering doubt
[46:43] that you have um or you're looking for
[46:46] information that can help you in turn
[46:50] share this information with with with
[46:51] with others. Um but that that provides
[46:54] me a lot of confidence right that you've
[46:57] doesn't matter across our entire human
[46:59] species
[47:01] men regardless of age regardless of
[47:03] language geography etc that people have
[47:06] gone through this process and arrive
[47:08] that that same conclusion that tells me
[47:11] that there's something you know
[47:13] fundamentally true and virtuous to
[47:18] Bitcoin and and and its place in our
[47:21] world and and and its value proposition,
[47:23] you know, that that's what I would
[47:25] that's what I, you know, that's one of
[47:27] my, you know, main points whenever I'm
[47:31] trying to, you know, talk to someone
[47:32] about about Bitcoin. Um, is really it's
[47:35] going to take time. You know, there's a
[47:37] lot to learn and you're going to come
[47:39] across a lot of really terrible takes,
[47:42] you know, about about um what it means
[47:45] to be into Bitcoin that if you are into
[47:47] Bitcoin or if you're a true Bitcoiner
[47:49] that you must do X, Y, or Zed. and
[47:51] that's going to like push you away. Just
[47:54] resist the temptation to do that and
[47:56] realize that Bitcoin is for everyone.
[47:58] Bitcoin is code. Bitcoin is a network.
[48:00] Bitcoin is money. Um and you can adapt
[48:03] it to whatever your needs are uh in in
[48:07] life. But if you dedicate, you know, an
[48:10] adequate amount of time, you know, that
[48:11] minimum of I whatever 5 10 hours just to
[48:15] kind of get the basics in and get your
[48:17] feet grounded that, you know, people
[48:20] around the world are arriving at the
[48:22] same conclusions that that that you are.
[48:25] Um, and that should tell you something,
[48:27] right? People around the world are
[48:28] drinking
[48:30] water, right? People around the world
[48:32] are taking in sunlight.
[48:35] people around the world are are are are
[48:38] hoping and using Bitcoin.
[48:40] I love that. That that that that's a
[48:42] really really good one.
[48:45] Also, it's fascinating how the current
[48:49] state never has to explain itself, but
[48:53] the new thing always has to explain
[48:56] everything in great detail. So in in
[48:59] when we come to like Bitcoin, you get
[49:02] asked the question of like quantum
[49:04] computers and and what about that small
[49:06] detail?
[49:08] Um the PayPal system, uh the Fiat rails,
[49:12] the AC rails, they never have to uh they
[49:16] never get the question asked like, "Oh,
[49:18] what are you doing for quantum
[49:21] computing?" Uh even though Bitcoin is
[49:23] way more safe against that than any
[49:26] field rails, um Bitcoin gets the
[49:29] questions not not not not the field
[49:31] system because the field system is the
[49:32] current state uh and the the new thing
[49:35] has to explain itself in great detail.
[49:39] That's the hubris of incumbent systems,
[49:41] right? and incumbent structures that you
[49:43] know you can go back through all of
[49:46] human history and look at one after the
[49:49] other that that uh that uh um that that
[49:54] uh assumption that this government, this
[49:58] empire, this system, this structure will
[50:00] never be displaced. Um and inevitably
[50:03] they are. um in in the last, you know,
[50:06] sort of um generation of of
[50:09] technological displacements, the the
[50:11] blockbuster videos and the Kodak cameras
[50:15] um of of our world that scoffed at the
[50:19] advent of the internet and h and and you
[50:22] know, new technologies and how those
[50:24] would disrupt their their model. Um you
[50:27] know, we're were we're were displaced.
[50:30] This is just a feature of a feature of
[50:33] of human beings and our resistance to
[50:36] change and our in-built hubris, but also
[50:39] of of incumbent structures um in
[50:42] general. But uh
[50:45] um the march of history continues and
[50:48] and newer, better technologies displace
[50:51] previous ones and and Bitcoin will do
[50:53] that to our current fiat
[50:56] um currencies and our our current
[50:58] financial monetary systems.
[51:01] You also uh uh I think in in Canada, h
[51:05] how is how is Bitcoin adoption going
[51:07] there? We hear conflicting information.
[51:10] I ironically the Bank of Canada
[51:14] conducted research into the rate of
[51:17] Bitcoin adoption and prior to
[51:20] um you know the the the
[51:22] the debacle and collapse of FTX and um
[51:26] everything that happened in 2021 um they
[51:29] had identified that adoption the
[51:31] adoption rate was at about 20% 20% of
[51:34] Canadians were into Bitcoin I believe it
[51:36] was Bitcoin and crypto but you know as
[51:39] we all know It's rare that people who
[51:41] hold crypto don't also hold Bitcoin. So
[51:44] I would I use that as a proxy. Um you
[51:47] know that it was Bitcoin and and and
[51:50] and crypto as well. Now that and there
[51:53] were also a couple of other um there
[51:55] were also a couple of other province
[51:57] level uh government entities that or
[52:00] regulatory bodies that did independent
[52:02] studies and it seems like the figure
[52:04] that they came up with was somewhere
[52:06] between 15 and 20% you know at from 2021
[52:11] to
[52:12] 2023. Um but you wouldn't think it's
[52:15] that high just based on the the level of
[52:19] you know sort of um social discussion
[52:22] mainstream media coverage and
[52:24] anecdotally you know if you go you know
[52:27] to a hundred of your 100 people in your
[52:30] in your you know local network you might
[52:33] find two or three people um who have
[52:35] some sort of exposure to it. Um and and
[52:38] so I I think it says a couple of things.
[52:40] I think it says the majority of people
[52:43] who are using Bitcoin in Canada are are
[52:46] hodling it. Um it's a it's a it's seen
[52:48] as an investment. Um it's not being used
[52:51] as money. Now there are pockets of
[52:54] activity where it is being used as money
[52:56] and there's some great tools here. Um,
[52:59] and so there, you know, there there
[53:00] there are some pockets of activity, but
[53:03] by and large in in Canada, it's the
[53:07] store of value um use case that that
[53:10] that dominates
[53:12] um and for all the reasons that like we
[53:14] discussed at the beginning of the of our
[53:16] of our conversation, right? We have
[53:18] relatively stable fiat currency. We have
[53:22] relatively well functioning um banking
[53:25] and financial financial rail. So the you
[53:28] know there isn't as acute need for
[53:31] Bitcoin as money to to to to fill those
[53:34] um
[53:36] needs but um there is some momentum
[53:39] developing
[53:40] um regardless of what one thinks of the
[53:44] you know that episode of the trucker
[53:46] convoy in Canada that's now famous right
[53:49] glo globally where people were were had
[53:52] were you know had their their financial
[53:54] assets bank accounts frozen
[53:57] um based on their participation in that
[53:59] and Bitcoin played a role in that. Now,
[54:01] regardless of what you think of uh of of
[54:04] the you know the the trucker convoy and
[54:07] all the politics that surrounded that,
[54:09] the reality is that was an example of
[54:14] you know the state overreaching and um
[54:19] demonstrating that they can and under
[54:21] particular circumstances will you know
[54:24] engage in that sort of activity. So that
[54:26] was an you know that was an excellent
[54:29] advertisement for um for Bitcoin and a
[54:32] lot of people tuned into that
[54:34] particularly a lot of people who were in
[54:36] favor of what you know the trucker
[54:39] convoy stood for um and who were opposed
[54:43] to vaccine mandates and and so forth.
[54:46] Now, in the United States with, you
[54:49] know, the election of Trump and a more
[54:51] quote unquote right-wing
[54:54] um political, again, I'm I'm just using
[54:56] those terms for the sake of convenience.
[54:59] Um, you know, political culture. Um, I
[55:04] believe that we're going to see a lot
[55:06] more individuals and groups who would
[55:08] identify on the left side of the
[55:10] political spectrum, individuals,
[55:12] families, groups, um, being put in
[55:15] positions where they're going to um, you
[55:19] know, need to consider the value of of
[55:20] of Bitcoin. Um recently we just saw in
[55:24] the United States for instance that um
[55:27] the I believe it was the Internal
[55:28] Revenue Service, I'm not I I believe um
[55:31] I I forget exactly which federal agency
[55:34] it was was um um uh freezing the uh
[55:39] accounts of Habitat for Humanity
[55:42] um you know under you know suspicions
[55:45] that maybe there was misuse of funds
[55:48] etc. regardless and regardless of
[55:51] whether there perhaps was some some
[55:53] wrongdoing doing there. It's that
[55:56] weaponization of of you know banking and
[56:00] financial systems by a particular
[56:03] government that you know is going to
[56:06] cause people you know from the center
[56:08] left of the political spectrum to
[56:10] actually perhaps look at um the role of
[56:13] Bitcoin and and that's something it's
[56:16] worth mentioning. Um, I'm a member of
[56:18] the board of a new not for-profit
[56:20] organization that's based in the United
[56:22] States called uh Progressive Bitcoiner.
[56:24] You may be familiar with the book, The
[56:26] Progressive, A Progressives Case for
[56:28] Bitcoin by Jason Meyer. Um, and the
[56:31] podcast, the uh Progressive Bitcoiner
[56:33] podcast that that's been operational for
[56:35] a few years now. It's now a
[56:37] notfor-profit organization. And the the
[56:39] role of that it's a it's a nonpartisan
[56:41] organization, but the organ but the the
[56:44] role of that organization is to help
[56:46] people who by and large um you know
[56:50] would consider themselves center left um
[56:53] on the political spectrum to understand
[56:55] the value of Bitcoin, the the human
[56:57] rights use cases, the case for um
[57:00] economic inclusion and and and so forth.
[57:04] Um and you know a lot of us who are
[57:05] involved in that work you know believe
[57:08] that um this is an important opportunity
[57:11] for for for individuals and groups from
[57:13] the center left to actually finally
[57:16] grock Bitcoin cuz they're about to find
[57:19] out hopefully we're wrong but I think
[57:21] many are about to find out what
[57:23] government overreach and weaponization
[57:25] of of money and financial systems can
[57:28] look like if you look at groups like
[57:30] Planned Parenthood or or or others. Um,
[57:33] so, uh, that was a bit of a a rand I
[57:36] forget what the original question was.
[57:38] Oh, it was about about Canada. Um, that
[57:40] was using the example of the United
[57:42] States. The same thing would apply in
[57:43] Canada, right? Where um, you know,
[57:46] people who may not have originally
[57:49] um, you know, taken an interest in
[57:51] Bitcoin because they didn't align with,
[57:54] let's say, the the vision of the trucker
[57:56] convoy or center center right ideology,
[57:59] politics, etc. may have cause in the
[58:02] near future to actually better
[58:05] appreciate how you know why having a a
[58:10] neutral censorship resistant digital
[58:13] portable
[58:15] non-debaseable currency uh and store of
[58:18] value is is is important. So it it's
[58:21] it's it's really dynamic here in Canada.
[58:24] Um again just sort of the takeaway is is
[58:27] you know the majority who are holding
[58:29] Bitcoin are doing so as an investment
[58:32] store of value. There is growth of
[58:34] activity when it comes to medium of
[58:36] exchange. Um, and you know, we h we now
[58:39] have a a national not for-profit
[58:41] organization that I'm um um the
[58:44] operational lead for here in Canada to
[58:46] try to help advance education and and
[58:49] engage with um political parties across
[58:52] the political spectrum to have them
[58:53] understand the value and uses of of of
[58:57] Bitcoin. Uh yeah, we're we're Bitcoin is
[59:01] is is you know is is is unfolding in a
[59:06] in a time of like great social, economic
[59:10] and political upheaval and um uh it's
[59:13] it's complex. I imagine you know much
[59:16] the same in in Austria or Germany. Yeah,
[59:18] I think all of Europe
[59:20] unfortunately especially the EU region.
[59:23] I mean Swiss is is better. I I I I hear
[59:27] uh there's Madira it's also in in Europe
[59:30] um uh which uh I I think is doing really
[59:33] good on grassroots levels like there
[59:34] there are exceptions but I think uh
[59:38] Europe has an maybe a similar stance
[59:41] than than than Canada uh has in many
[59:44] ways but there are a lot of political
[59:48] things shifting actually also in Europe
[59:50] um which is fascinating to to witness
[59:54] has uh and I I do hope there's some some
[59:57] some change coming their way. But I
[59:59] think the most important thing that you
[60:01] said and I think that is really crucial
[60:03] that Bitcoin is neutral in in every
[60:07] single way also political. So like it's
[60:09] it's it's just open source code that
[60:12] open source code can never be right or
[60:15] left.
[60:16] Yeah. And and you know the two I mean
[60:19] two aspects to to that. One is just that
[60:21] simple fact right that it's neutral open
[60:24] code that can be used by anyone. It can
[60:26] be used for you know the most altruistic
[60:28] humanitarian purposes. It can also be
[60:30] used for terrible nefarious purposes.
[60:33] Right? And that has nothing to do with
[60:35] the tool itself being designed for one
[60:39] or the other. That has to do with human
[60:40] beings doing human being things. um the
[60:44] same way that the the US dollar can be
[60:46] used to purchase you know a
[60:49] a you know um a baby stroller or it can
[60:52] be used to to money launder and and
[60:55] support organized crime. Um you know um
[60:59] so there's that facet of it as well.
[61:03] My hope hope slash and and fear my fear
[61:08] is that we you know there are many
[61:11] people who are are trying to turn
[61:14] Bitcoin into a partisan tool right that
[61:17] ah you know if you're a Bitcoiner you
[61:19] must be Republican in the United States
[61:21] you must be a Trump supporter that
[61:23] somehow it's only Republicans only you
[61:26] know the MAGA crowd and and Trump
[61:28] supporters that um that really get
[61:31] Bitcoin and and and will use Bitco
[61:33] Bitcoin and that has, you know, the risk
[61:35] of alienating people who don't see
[61:38] themselves in that camp. I'm I'm
[61:39] speaking trying to speak as a as a
[61:41] nonpartisan just sort of observer of
[61:44] this. I'm not passing judgment on on
[61:46] this other than to say like I I think we
[61:50] really need to try to as as as
[61:54] Bitcoiners who truly believe in the in
[61:56] the the best possible social human
[62:00] outcomes that Bitcoin can lead to need
[62:04] to try to help people see that, you
[62:07] know, it's a neutral asset and, you
[62:10] know, can be used by anyone. Um but that
[62:14] in fact if you actually go through the
[62:17] lessons that Bitcoin helps you you know
[62:21] appreciate like what is money? What are
[62:24] the problems with our current, you know,
[62:26] fiat money and our current financial and
[62:29] economic systems? And what are the
[62:31] downstream consequences of that in terms
[62:34] of the monetization and financialization
[62:36] of housing, in terms of uh accentuating
[62:40] the income and wealth gap in our
[62:43] societies, etc., and all of those
[62:45] downstream impacts. As Bitcoiners, I
[62:48] think we can then see that all of these
[62:50] things that we then fight about socially
[62:53] and attribute, you know, wrongdoing to,
[62:56] you know, the other side of the
[62:57] political spectrum are not necessarily
[63:00] about those communist liberals over
[63:02] there or those, you know, right-wing
[63:05] fascist, you know, Republicans over
[63:07] there, right? But are really about our
[63:10] broken money and our broken systems. And
[63:14] so if we can all diagnose the problems
[63:16] and say that, you know, Bitcoin not only
[63:18] is a learning tool that can help us
[63:20] better understand all of these social
[63:23] and economic phenomena, but can then
[63:25] help to actually remedy these, I think
[63:28] it can have a a a unifying force and
[63:33] impact in our society to say, you know,
[63:35] like, hey, maybe, you know, you are
[63:38] aligned over there with the Republican
[63:40] party or you are aligned over there with
[63:42] the Democrats.
[63:44] because you know you're believing in the
[63:47] solutions that they are you know you
[63:51] know you know offering up to problems
[63:55] that we all see but in fact neither of
[63:58] those is correct. you know that in fact
[64:02] if we were just to fix the money and
[64:04] really just to establish some fairness
[64:08] um and and you know some some more
[64:12] transparent systems and structures in
[64:14] the mix here that we would begin to
[64:18] reduce so many of these social problems
[64:21] that we all agree you know are are there
[64:24] and are getting worse and we could
[64:26] actually then have constructive dialogue
[64:29] about Okay, what are some reasonable
[64:32] solutions to to to these these these
[64:35] things? So, I'd like to see more
[64:37] Bitcoiners kind of focus on that and say
[64:39] like, hey, like let's let's dampen down
[64:43] the noise about, you know, about about
[64:46] right-wing bitcoining and left-wing
[64:49] bitcoining, etc., and like actually
[64:52] diagnose that the that that that
[64:54] political tribalism as being a byproduct
[64:58] of broken systems and and and like let's
[65:01] try to like step away from that as
[65:03] Bitcoiners and find like rediscover the
[65:05] center, you know, and Bitcoiners could
[65:07] be a real, you know, unifying force
[65:10] within our societies to actually bring
[65:12] people together and have like
[65:14] constructive um constructive dialogue. I
[65:17] know that's an incredibly hopeful and
[65:20] optimistic, you know, way to think given
[65:22] like what we see in in in in the world
[65:26] that surrounds us where, you know,
[65:27] there's just such division and such
[65:30] animosity and toxicity. But, um, if
[65:34] there are going to be forces in the
[65:36] world that I think can help bring us
[65:38] together, I think Bitcoin is one of the
[65:40] best, if not the best among them.
[65:44] Uh, 100%. It it I think it it it brings
[65:48] a trust back and it's almost like a clue
[65:50] to society.
[65:52] Um what I have one question to ask each
[65:55] and every one of my guests and the
[65:57] question is what can we learn from you
[65:59] besides Bitcoin? I think I was just
[66:01] speaking to it. Um you know I I'm
[66:05] someone who let's say in the in the
[66:07] Canadian context. So my background is in
[66:09] community health and development. uh did
[66:11] global health and community development
[66:12] work for 20 years and took leave of that
[66:15] um about 2 years ago to do more of a
[66:18] focus on on using Bitcoin as a tool for
[66:22] community development and and and so
[66:24] forth. Um but before I groed Bitcoin,
[66:28] you know, I definitely was someone who
[66:30] was, you know, would align politically
[66:32] on the the left side of this the
[66:34] spectrum um in Canada was a lifelong,
[66:38] you know, NDP voter, New Democratic
[66:40] Party voter, which is sort of our left
[66:42] leaning um uh party here was was very
[66:48] much down the line in favor of of
[66:50] everything that that political party
[66:52] would offer up in terms of of solutions
[66:55] to our problems. Um, but through the
[66:59] Bitcoin journey and you know everything
[67:01] exposes you to not only do I come to
[67:04] understand a lot of the fundamental
[67:06] errors of you know the the the
[67:11] the social, economic and political
[67:15] analysis that that political party
[67:17] participates in. Um, I still very much
[67:20] align with like the values and the
[67:22] spirit of like you know, social
[67:26] solidarity and, you know, making sure
[67:28] that we try to level the playing field
[67:31] and um eliminate social and economic and
[67:35] other disparities. But I now, you know,
[67:39] believe that that the political and
[67:41] economic analysis that that party
[67:44] engages in is bankrupt, right? Um I can
[67:47] also by virtue of like that that
[67:49] learning journey appreciate that the
[67:52] people on the right the political right
[67:55] let's say the conservative party in in
[67:57] the Canadian context that I used to like
[67:59] have a lot of animosity towards and and
[68:02] think were the problem you know that it
[68:05] was all about greed that it was all
[68:07] about you know strict individualism that
[68:10] it was all about about um you know
[68:14] excluding ing as many people as possible
[68:18] who don't look like them or sound like
[68:20] them from systems of power, etc. I I
[68:23] assigned all of these things to them. I
[68:26] actually got to know more people on a
[68:28] personal level who, you know, who align
[68:33] um with the Conservative party and and
[68:35] with the quote unquote rightwing, you
[68:37] know, came to discover that, you know
[68:39] what, like good people who actually care
[68:43] about most of the things that I that I
[68:45] care about, right? who fundamentally ju
[68:47] who want a better society. Um just have
[68:50] a different, you know, set of ideas
[68:53] about how we achieve that and that we're
[68:56] actually talking across each other and
[68:59] and like these political parties pull us
[69:02] apart from each other, right? And it's
[69:04] the sport of politics where you got to
[69:06] be all for one or all for the other and
[69:09] there's no room or less and less room
[69:12] for compromise and constructive
[69:14] dialogue, etc. I've inhabited that and
[69:17] I've lived that for at least the last
[69:20] five five years and I'm now at a point
[69:22] where I'm like I think I'm finding my
[69:24] feet in the center and I consider myself
[69:28] postpartisan, right? I I I I I don't
[69:31] want anything to do really with any of
[69:33] the political parties because I see the
[69:36] broken incentives that fuel our
[69:39] political system. Um which are then in a
[69:42] world where we have broken money and
[69:44] broken financial systems that have
[69:46] perverse incentives and it's just this
[69:49] terrible cocktail that that's that
[69:52] that's killing us that's pitting us
[69:54] against each other and killing us. And
[69:56] so all of that maybe is a way of saying
[69:59] if some if you know if people can learn
[70:01] something from me it's to take a step
[70:03] back from their political
[70:06] alignments you know and to take that
[70:11] chance to step forward and talk to
[70:14] someone else from that other group that
[70:17] other you know uh political ideological
[70:21] party and to actually like start
[70:24] from first principles and values like
[70:27] what do you believe in like what do you
[70:29] think a better society looks like not
[70:31] what are the problems but like what do
[70:33] you fundamentally want if we could do
[70:35] more of that like I said earlier like we
[70:39] agree on so much more than it appears
[70:41] 80% of us can agree on about 80% of
[70:44] things and and that's kind of the the
[70:46] the truth that I'm trying to walk right
[70:49] now in terms of how I engage people I'm
[70:52] not willing to dismiss that person or
[70:54] that person over there. Um because I
[70:56] realize that like we're we're subject to
[70:59] all of these forces that are, you know,
[71:01] pulling us together.
[71:03] So yeah, talk to people, you know, take
[71:07] it down a notch, ask, you know,
[71:10] questions that try to get at, you know,
[71:14] where we can agree first. Build some
[71:17] level of of trust and and as Bitcoiners,
[71:21] you know, take that as a mission, right?
[71:23] Um because if we do that with each
[71:26] other, especially among Bitcoiners,
[71:28] we've got something that we believe in
[71:29] fundamentally, right? That this is this
[71:31] is better money, that this is an
[71:33] empowering revolutionary technology. Um
[71:36] that, you know, if we can commit to, you
[71:39] know, not antagonizing each other or,
[71:41] you know, saying there's no way you can
[71:43] be a progressive and a Bitcoiner,
[71:45] though, those are oxymorons. There's no
[71:47] way you can be this and a Bitcoiner,
[71:49] etc. like use that as a common common
[71:52] point of connection talk to each other
[71:54] and try to like build that like 10 years
[71:58] from now I think we'll be amazed at at
[72:01] how we can heal our societies and so
[72:04] that would be I guess what you could
[72:06] what you could learn from learn from me
[72:08] is a little bit more patience let's talk
[72:10] to each other and uh let's try to like
[72:13] come towards the center we we need more
[72:16] empathy I I totally agree with that
[72:19] really really cool. Um, we have a we
[72:22] have an end routine in the podcast where
[72:23] the previous guest is asking a question
[72:25] for the next guest without knowing who
[72:26] the next guest actually is and the
[72:28] previous guest asked you the question.
[72:30] What do you think is the most important
[72:32] step we can take to support the payment
[72:35] layer of of Bitcoin?
[72:37] Um, just using it.
[72:40] just using it even if it's not as
[72:42] convenient right now as that tap you
[72:46] know credit card or debit card um or you
[72:50] know even if you have to you know
[72:54] awkwardly ask a merchant um you know if
[72:58] they accept Bitcoin is just just make
[73:00] that effort
[73:03] um you know it's it's it's like the
[73:06] school dance if if everyone is around
[73:08] the corners of the room and no one steps
[73:11] into the middle of the the floor to
[73:13] dance. Um, you know, the party's never
[73:16] going to get started, right? So, I think
[73:18] each of us really just needs to make
[73:21] that effort to try to use it wherever we
[73:23] can and just know that, you know, like
[73:26] other technologies,
[73:29] um, something better is going to emerge,
[73:33] right? We we had uh portable tape
[73:37] recorder Walkman and then we had CD
[73:40] Walkman and now we had you know then we
[73:42] had MP MP3s and and now everything you
[73:46] know on our phone. But I think it was it
[73:48] was people using this and and creating a
[73:50] market for portable music which
[73:54] generated you know more investment in in
[73:57] developing better technologies and and
[73:59] and so forth. like this is just the
[74:01] evolutionary march of technologies. Um,
[74:05] and if you want a world where where you
[74:09] know using Bitcoin to pay for daily
[74:13] goods and services is as easy as for
[74:15] those of us anyway in you know Austria,
[74:18] Canada, the United States etc. is as
[74:20] easy as using your debit card or your
[74:22] credit card. Um,
[74:24] et. So I would my I would encourage
[74:27] people just make that effort. And if you
[74:29] know you don't want to let go of your
[74:32] Bitcoin, you know, cuz you know it's
[74:34] going to be more valuable in 6 months, a
[74:36] year, four years, etc. Spend and replace
[74:38] like right away. Spend it, go back, get
[74:42] some more, and replace that amount,
[74:44] right? Spend it, spend, and replace. We
[74:45] just got to we just you just got just
[74:47] got to do it. And if if we if we don't
[74:50] spend it, what's the point of
[74:52] peerto-peer money then? That's kind what
[74:55] I come uh come always uh uh back
[74:58] towards. Uh thank you so much, Scott, uh
[75:01] for for being on and for taking the
[75:02] time. Um before I let you go, where can
[75:04] people find you, ask your questions, and
[75:06] reach out to you? Sure. Um I'm on X. Uh
[75:10] my handle, which I imagine you'll have
[75:12] in show notes or elsewhere, is Scott A.
[75:15] Wolf.
[75:16] Wf. Um that's my handle on on X. I'm
[75:20] also on Noster um if people want to find
[75:23] me there. Um and uh at my on my handles
[75:27] you'll find connections to the
[75:29] Federation of Bitcoin Circular Economies
[75:32] as well as the uh Bitcoin Coalition of
[75:35] Canada. Um and then I just do one more
[75:37] one more plug uh for the Progressive
[75:40] Bitcoiner. If people go take a look at
[75:41] that, I'm a member of the board of
[75:43] directors. U amazing group of folks
[75:46] largely US and Canadian based at this
[75:48] point but a global mission um and you
[75:51] know I think it's a really important
[75:54] resource and tool for uh people who
[75:56] might you know initially align with you
[75:59] know sort of the vision and mission of
[76:01] that organization but also
[76:03] um you know for anyone who maybe maybe
[76:06] maybe doesn't but has family members
[76:09] friends etc who you know are lingering
[76:13] under some impression that Bitcoin might
[76:15] not be for them. It it might be another,
[76:18] you know, excellent place to uh to send
[76:20] them. Um so yeah, on X on Nost for
[76:23] myself and uh and you can find links to
[76:26] the organizations I just mentioned.
[76:28] Really cool. Thank you so much for for
[76:30] being on. Also, thank you so much for
[76:31] everyone that has uh uh for everyone
[76:34] that is watching and listening, for
[76:35] joining us today. As always, I'll be
