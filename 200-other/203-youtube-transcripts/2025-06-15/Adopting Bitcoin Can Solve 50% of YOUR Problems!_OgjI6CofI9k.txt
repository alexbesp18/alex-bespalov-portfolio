[00:00] because of Bitcoin because of this
[00:01] decentralized making more and more
[00:03] people decentralized you can own your
[00:05] asset you can own the most valuable
[00:07] asset permission list but when people
[00:09] got formal I think that also will help
[00:12] because why because Bitcoin is absolute
[00:15] scarcity then when more and more people
[00:17] learn about it realize it and interest
[00:19] in and to to keep it to buy it to hold
[00:23] it then demand Supply economy 101 right
[00:28] we know the answer 50% of of the problem
[00:30] of the world right so money is a key
[00:32] thing because it's related to all
[00:34] people's economy right living family
[00:36] Corporation so money is the different we
[00:39] so that's why the revolution of I mean
[00:41] from internet right the revolution is
[00:43] only for information not on the money
[00:44] side before and now we see it's coming
[00:47] so when Bitcoin reach to certain
[00:49] adoption phase it will be less than less
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] volatile if you it's really interesting
[00:59] how you got all in the Bitcoin and your
[01:01] story uh but before we start with all
[01:03] the topics and also with Trump and
[01:05] everything what's going on currently
[01:07] maybe give viers a little bit of a
[01:08] background who you are and and and why
[01:11] you're in Bitcoin yeah uh I've been
[01:13] working in business business area for
[01:17] about 25 years uh I've been working for
[01:21] major US bank before in in Asia and also
[01:25] I work for more than 10 years for a uh
[01:28] major big technology Manufacturing
[01:30] Company also it's a is a global global
[01:33] scale Global size so and uh recent year
[01:37] I gradually put more focus into uh
[01:42] help developing and investing and
[01:45] educating in Bitcoin space because I
[01:47] think this once in our lifetime it's a
[01:50] very very precious uh opportunity to to
[01:55] get my time and my energy my my my all
[01:59] of my resource to focus on this very
[02:02] meaningful Journey interesting I also
[02:05] always find it interesting uh what bit
[02:07] corers really are because uh we are so
[02:10] early in a in a revolution and uh I saw
[02:14] last time a chart where they analyzed
[02:17] who is in our population and then uh who
[02:20] are the bitcoiners and it was like those
[02:22] people who are very common in the
[02:25] population are very rare in the Bitcoin
[02:27] space and those who are in the general
[02:29] population very rare is actually very
[02:31] common in Bitcoin um so give us a little
[02:33] bit of understanding uh in in in what
[02:36] you have done in your life that uh
[02:39] Bitcoin made so early sense for you yeah
[02:42] yeah good question yeah indeed in my age
[02:45] of this kind of I'm over 50 years old uh
[02:49] very well not only I mean Asia extremely
[02:51] real but also Europe and even us still
[02:54] relatively it's very small percentage as
[02:57] of now but why make my
[03:00] uh my judgment is different than most of
[03:02] other people in my in my age is because
[03:06] of my experience before I'm the person
[03:09] who who like to who very uh Curious on
[03:13] the new technology the new thing how to
[03:17] how to make thing more efficient how to
[03:19] make our life work more efficient more
[03:21] effective in a more technological way so
[03:25] uh my my previous uh my previous career
[03:29] experience
[03:30] I've been I've been leading uh
[03:33] investment Strategic investment in a in
[03:35] a major technology firm so to invest
[03:38] globally to look at all the new
[03:40] technology globally and uh also I I I've
[03:43] been in China for for the last almost 20
[03:47] years so I also seen the growth of China
[03:51] uh the economy everything so I have this
[03:54] kind of quite unique experience to to
[03:58] experience this kind of leading Leading
[04:01] Age of a financial Innovation especially
[04:04] oh one more thing is that I've been
[04:06] working for traditional banking industry
[04:08] I've been working for two largest US
[04:11] bank before back to 20 years ago so I
[04:15] also know about banking I also know
[04:16] about financial service and also after
[04:19] my experience in the techn leading
[04:21] technology
[04:22] space then I found out how old fashion
[04:26] of this the
[04:27] try work is doing I mean how
[04:30] inefficiency especially in the current
[04:32] digital age which led by
[04:35] internet after the last 20 years so I I
[04:39] gradually I realized the financial
[04:41] service at the banking system need need
[04:44] to be fully fully fully uh get more
[04:48] Innovation get more even
[04:50] revolutionalized to to make the change
[04:53] the internet has already changed the
[04:54] information
[04:55] Chang online shopping change most many
[04:59] things in our life however the banking
[05:02] the money side has not yet so that's why
[05:05] when I learn about Bitcoin when I
[05:08] discovered Bitcoin I found that's
[05:10] something very fascinating after I spend
[05:12] my 100 hour 500 hour, hour dig into the
[05:17] Bitcoin Rabbit Hole I found out this the
[05:20] this is the best opportunity for us to
[05:23] promote it to embrace it to educate
[05:26] people worldwide this is the this is the
[05:29] future this is the future Financial
[05:32] infrastructure for for all the people
[05:35] living in the digital age did you
[05:37] understand while being in the banking
[05:39] system uh how bad the banking system is
[05:42] already working or was it kind of with
[05:43] Bitcoin that you
[05:45] understood how how the bank system is
[05:47] working let's put regulation aside but
[05:50] even though I mean we are in a good
[05:52] timing today and that's a new regulation
[05:54] coming right we know it's coming but
[05:56] anyway let's put regulation aside let's
[05:59] compare the how inefficiency of you when
[06:03] you do a Bitcoin transaction sending
[06:05] people Bitcoin through either through
[06:08] the Manet or lining even faster or I
[06:11] mean compared to to the traditional
[06:13] Financial system when you sending the
[06:16] bang wild or sending the whatever uh
[06:19] International remittance you know you
[06:22] you know and also one is working for uh
[06:25] 27 uh 24 hours 7 Days the other is only
[06:29] working for Monday to Friday many
[06:34] so this is a totally totally behind of
[06:38] our limit we use Uber we use uh whatever
[06:41] online app to to do all the thing all
[06:44] the service so I think totally this is
[06:46] behind but why bring this new technology
[06:50] being uh behind is because this involved
[06:54] with the money so money is is more
[06:57] complicated than only the information
[06:59] because it that's a because always when
[07:02] whatever thing is touch about money is
[07:04] highly regulated right because otherwise
[07:07] people will take
[07:08] advantage from other people so the
[07:11] regulation has not come into the to in
[07:14] place yet for the last 10 year and now
[07:19] it's it's it's kind of coming with the
[07:20] new Administration yeah yeah yeah I
[07:22] think this this is the new era it's
[07:25] interesting how how much was changed in
[07:27] the last uh 10 10 years so you said like
[07:31] around 10 years you in Bitcoin uh now uh
[07:35] it's it's I heard stories actually think
[07:37] on Monday where someone told me like he
[07:39] was in Bitcoin in 2014 he came in there
[07:42] and he had to because I I came into 2020
[07:46] so there were already exchanges there
[07:47] were all a lot of infrastructure already
[07:50] there but back then uh he had to go to a
[07:54] a basically a local dealer to get
[07:56] Bitcoin uh because there was nothing in
[07:58] his area to get Bitcoin otherwise and it
[08:01] felt almost like a truck deal and it's
[08:03] kind of interesting how quickly we came
[08:05] from that area to like now there's ETFs
[08:09] and Nation stes buying there's like only
[08:11] in Austria we have two different Bitcoin
[08:13] only exchanges in Austria is so small
[08:15] like 8 million people we don't need
[08:17] different Bitcoin only providers then
[08:19] all the crypto and and shitcoin casinos
[08:21] that we also have like we have come very
[08:24] far away in the in quite a small period
[08:27] of Time how do you look at the the the
[08:29] last year's um developments with like
[08:32] ETFs with all the exchanges all the
[08:35] regulations that kind of have happened
[08:37] yeah yeah sure sure yeah 10 years ago
[08:40] when I know about Bitcoin just like you
[08:42] say that's those kind of thing it's
[08:44] always right it's more like a very small
[08:46] group of even it's hard for you to get
[08:48] it and in a even you can say in a
[08:51] legitimate way even people treat you
[08:52] differently some people think oh you are
[08:54] doing something maybe UNR for something
[08:58] but now it's a because this is I think
[09:01] the adoption phase usually uh usually
[09:03] would take something like this from a
[09:06] very individual and cyber P those thing
[09:10] gradually to more uh institution
[09:13] Corporation gradually to government as
[09:16] now as from today when Trump just signed
[09:20] the the SBR uh so I I think this is
[09:26] something uh for the new product new
[09:29] technology usually this is the right
[09:31] path to go but as I mentioned since it
[09:34] involved with money so usually it take
[09:36] longer it because it's more complicated
[09:39] so understand but I I'm the person since
[09:43] with the experience in the banking in
[09:45] the technology industry before with a
[09:48] major corporation before so I see this
[09:52] uh this this phenomena I mean it's
[09:55] understandable however I think this this
[09:58] is a new chapter begin and also I think
[10:01] this is a good really good chance for me
[10:04] to to devot my time and my energy in and
[10:08] resource into this space by all means so
[10:11] so you're going actually with all your
[10:12] time and Investments uh now into Bitcoin
[10:15] then was this shift for you where you
[10:17] completely went okay now it's it's
[10:19] Bitcoin and and I kind of leave uh the
[10:22] the past World Behind or how far along
[10:25] the the line are
[10:26] you uh I I'm sorry can you repat the
[10:30] question hey it's I'm just wondering of
[10:32] like um you're now uh more and more
[10:35] coming in Bitcoin parcast going things
[10:38] and you came from uh the TR investment
[10:41] world with technology and banking um how
[10:44] far are you already kind of already all
[10:47] in Bitcoin with your time and energy I
[10:49] think Jeff PO is is kind of was saying
[10:51] is like he kind of realized he invested
[10:54] all his money in in in Bitcoin and then
[10:57] uh at the end of the day he's like oh
[10:59] worked for field all day long like then
[11:02] it was like okay I want to be also with
[11:04] time I see I would say since I think uh
[11:08] between the 2015 and 2020 before the co
[11:11] hit that five year that's the the I is a
[11:15] is a is a kind of transition period for
[11:18] my career to get into the Bitcoin why
[11:21] because as I mentioned earlier I I've
[11:23] been working for a technology company
[11:25] I've been in charge of investment and
[11:28] later uh I also found a uh kind of a uh
[11:33] Venture fund to of course is supported
[11:35] by the major cup uh my major technology
[11:38] company to to explore this space explore
[11:41] this what we call the fintech financial
[11:43] technology including the blockchain and
[11:46] also of course we realiz last the year
[11:48] 2015 I realize Bitcoin thing yeah and so
[11:54] because of this five year of experience
[11:56] so we start to think about oh this
[11:59] fintech this is blockchain this is
[12:01] something could be meaningful to change
[12:04] to change our financial service model so
[12:07] then I got into this space and then we
[12:10] mix uh we miss with a very I believe at
[12:13] that time 2015 2016 it's very prominent
[12:17] investment we become one of the major
[12:19] investor of a digital currency group at
[12:21] that time of course we own on great
[12:24] scale and Genesis and coindesk so so the
[12:28] founders Barry and I we we become friend
[12:31] and he share a lot of industrial
[12:33] information with me and also his
[12:35] portfolio so I I start to look at those
[12:38] portfolio company as well to learn about
[12:40] this space learn about how blockchain
[12:42] cryptocurrency and Bitcoin related
[12:45] work uh uh for the for the investment
[12:49] opportunity then because of this journey
[12:52] of this five year I think uh we invest
[12:55] in quite a few blockchain company and
[12:58] also we invest in some like a crypto
[13:00] wallet company and also invest in oh the
[13:04] company for example now is is a is a big
[13:06] one galaxy galaxy digital so I've been a
[13:09] b Bo director of a galaxy for three
[13:11] years the first three years before IPO
[13:14] and then at the listed in in Toronto
[13:17] Stock Exchange so because of those
[13:21] Journey uh I I've been thinking about
[13:24] how to make how to I learn about those
[13:27] crypto and blockchain thing and also
[13:29] Bitcoin but gradually after Co hit
[13:32] that's a good timing about half year
[13:35] every everywhere is shut down so I have
[13:38] to stay at home at in Asia also I got
[13:40] several quar quarantine at hotel before
[13:44] I enter into another country then I I
[13:48] spent a lot of time several hundred
[13:50] hours at this to learn about my question
[13:53] was why over the last 5 years since I've
[13:56] been investing those the leading crypto
[13:59] company including dcg including Galaxy
[14:02] why cannot really make business work
[14:06] like internet like a Facebook make
[14:08] people walk Uber make people life easier
[14:12] something like that so I mean keep
[14:14] digging to studying since I have we have
[14:18] time right that time then you have to
[14:20] stay you cannot you cannot travel then I
[14:23] realize huh indeed this kind of
[14:26] so-called decentralized blockchain Tech
[14:29] technology only work for money not for
[14:32] those other thing uh yeah and also
[14:35] previous year as I say even for some
[14:37] company I invest so doing some
[14:39] blockchain Revolution that kind of thing
[14:42] even I I brought my my company's uh
[14:47] resource supply chain manufacturing to
[14:50] them to study whether the So-Cal
[14:53] blockchain can work for supply chain can
[14:57] work for can work for those those the I
[15:00] mean tracking the Order checking those
[15:02] thing and and then indeed none of them
[15:05] work still garbage in garbage out still
[15:07] some people come I like to use this Gage
[15:10] in gab out and then so that's why I'm
[15:13] say when Co lock shut lock down shut
[15:16] down then I realized this kind of
[15:19] blockchain Technology only work for
[15:20] money and which is a
[15:22] Bitcoin and from 2021 I start my my
[15:26] journey in I I always say at the
[15:28] beginning maybe 50% later 2022 20 23
[15:34] 100% And then of course I yeah I mean I
[15:37] still keep learning about what the
[15:38] crypto people is doing just like what
[15:41] the exactly order signed by President
[15:43] Trump today early today ear today is
[15:46] like that's that's a digital asset of
[15:49] course there's crypto token that's nft
[15:52] that's a mean coin whatever you treat it
[15:54] as a digital token dig digitize Equity
[15:58] or Tok or whatever or whatever nft for
[16:01] souvenir that's okay however only
[16:04] Bitcoin is decentralized only Bitcoin
[16:06] can be treated as a as a people's money
[16:10] as a people's uh digital goal sto
[16:13] storeold of wealth right as a reserve as
[16:17] a as a national Reserve not the digital
[16:22] asset so so everything clear so so the
[16:26] signing of exactly order today by Trump
[16:29] I think this pool our what what what we
[16:33] have learned from the early day over the
[16:35] last 10 years is
[16:37] correct it's super interesting because
[16:39] there are people like Brian Armstrong
[16:43] who came out publicly said like in the
[16:46] crypto Reserve only Bitcoin makes sense
[16:49] like we we and then he is saying like
[16:51] Okay Bitcoin is the only thing but at
[16:53] his platform of coin Vis has all the all
[16:57] the all the uh mean coins altcoins the
[17:00] [ __ ] coins in there which is for me
[17:02] interesting of like saying the one thing
[17:05] okay only Bitcoin makes sense but like
[17:07] we also offer the variety of all all the
[17:10] me yeah this is very interesting
[17:12] question I've been also thinking about
[17:14] this over the last few months when
[17:16] people talk about uh this kind of thing
[17:19] stock pile or Reserve or whatever then
[17:21] adding up digital asset adding up people
[17:25] SRP something like that but I think what
[17:28] they have sign today is very briefly but
[17:31] very precise and accurate is that
[17:34] because uh still those people I mean not
[17:37] only Bri even b b said I knew him for a
[17:40] decade ago so they also Echo with what
[17:45] the EO uh uh sign that's the right way
[17:50] to move because otherwise I think as now
[17:54] everyone recognized Bitcoin is without
[17:57] owner is a true decentral
[17:59] it could be served as a monetary
[18:02] Protocol no other what we call the
[18:06] better no no other coin can can replace
[18:09] Bitcoin position however I think because
[18:13] of because of this kind of since 10
[18:15] years ago more than 10 years ago this
[18:17] kind of allcoin or Bitcoin imit imitator
[18:21] because the people you know we got to
[18:23] think about we are not living in the
[18:25] utopian world we are not living in our
[18:27] the you know the the some Island without
[18:30] associate with the world so when people
[18:33] work together or join together some
[18:35] people want to make money this is a
[18:36] human nature right this is human nature
[18:39] and since the regulation has not yet
[18:42] been clear and and since that's a
[18:45] technology can help you to to to create
[18:48] a coin to get in earlier and then the
[18:52] the VC can also get in to support you
[18:55] and then other majority in other
[18:58] individual then they also want to make
[19:00] money I think because this is a human
[19:02] nature so now let's the good good thing
[19:06] is that now there there will be a
[19:08] regulation to regulate this part I mean
[19:11] all coin part whatever coin whatever
[19:15] mecoin because as I say this is like a
[19:17] digital treated as a digital Equity
[19:19] either public or
[19:21] non-public so clear and only Bitcoin
[19:25] it's totally different species so that's
[19:27] why a few days ago I've been tweeting
[19:29] one thing is that because of this coin
[19:33] bigcoin the other called other coin
[19:37] whatever coin people treat as a coin
[19:39] treat as the same species and when those
[19:42] guy doing bad on those coin then they
[19:45] just treat Bitcoin as the same category
[19:47] but indeed that that was
[19:49] wrong and the the separation between
[19:52] like all the other ones and Bitcoin has
[19:54] to be very clear I think because a lot
[19:56] of people think like oh like there Solan
[19:58] there's ethereum and and they all put it
[20:00] in one basket yes and they hear
[20:02] something bad about Solana and they also
[20:04] say like oh like Bitcoin also is bad
[20:06] because yeah Al also like I mentioned
[20:07] coinbase and other major exchange
[20:09] because they list all of the coin
[20:10] because I say it's a human we are all
[20:13] human being right they have they they
[20:16] have to pay the employees Sal to make
[20:18] money for shareholder right so if only
[20:21] Bitcoin maybe back to 12 years ago right
[20:24] when coinbase found it that's only
[20:26] Bitcoin then maybe it hard to how to
[20:28] compete how to survive with those other
[20:31] major Chinese F crypto exchange right so
[20:35] you have to so this is the human nature
[20:38] I think anyway but as I as I say since I
[20:41] think from today this exactly old sign
[20:44] can make this two category Bitcoin
[20:46] versus digital asset other digital asset
[20:50] clear and separate I think this is the
[20:53] beginning you spoke about that before
[20:55] already of of there's a new era coming
[20:58] what do you mean by that uh because uh
[21:01] if you look at the detail of the
[21:03] executive order sign uh announced by
[21:05] David sax a few hours ago there a
[21:08] digital goal people already treat
[21:10] Bitcoin uh I'm say uh Trump
[21:12] Administration has already signed and
[21:14] treat Bitcoin as a digital goal so
[21:17] that's the Bitcoin have been advocate
[21:20] for more than five years 10 years right
[21:22] so now is the the time to come now it's
[21:25] it's officially I like off it's it's
[21:28] difficult there's also a lot of uh
[21:30] people and I I even tweeted myself about
[21:32] that in the morning um that say like oh
[21:35] like it's not that uh great that
[21:38] actually America is now buying Bitcoin
[21:40] because we want the uh families we want
[21:42] the crossroads Movement we want to have
[21:44] the the PLS having the possibility to
[21:47] buy as many Bitcoin as possible they had
[21:49] now 16 years time before the government
[21:52] uh and but a lot of people say like oh
[21:53] like we don't even want the government
[21:55] to buy Bitcoin uh because we want the
[21:58] BLS about Bitcoin and if if I mean now
[22:00] they're not buying it they're just
[22:02] having a stock pile but what if the
[22:04] government is now starting do they say
[22:06] like hey we we buy now every year 20,000
[22:08] Bitcoin that that would make the price
[22:11] run up for a lot how do you think about
[22:13] the Grassroots movement and how
[22:15] surprised are you actually that America
[22:17] is the first mover like America is like
[22:20] on top of the field game and my my
[22:23] theory was always uh a country that is
[22:26] down at the field game like a Salvador
[22:29] those kind of countries or Budan those
[22:31] will start but America is very
[22:33] surprising for me that they start with
[22:35] the the I've been visited for this
[22:39] purpose I've been visiting Al a couple
[22:41] times over the last two years yeah so I
[22:43] also try to feel about how this a small
[22:46] company a small country when they did
[22:49] this such Initiative for accumulated
[22:51] Bitcoin even at that time making bco the
[22:53] leg legal tender okay so Su see how
[22:57] impact
[22:59] uh buy it and uh now since the us
[23:03] because the US America is still the
[23:05] number one global economy even though
[23:06] China is a competing keep going up then
[23:10] however still us dominate the Global
[23:12] Financial system right even the Germany
[23:16] of American right and then Trump want to
[23:19] make American great again also and then
[23:22] is the influence of a us from US
[23:25] government to worldwide especially in
[23:28] the financial system related to monetary
[23:32] right that's very I think should be very
[23:36] uh very huge so for the announcement of
[23:40] a strategic Bitcoin Reserve effective
[23:43] right now then I think regardless how
[23:47] many Bitcoin US government is going to
[23:50] buy in the next few year so I think that
[23:53] let's say okay even though they buy 1
[23:55] million Bitcoin for the next 5 years
[23:58] even even though also they also announc
[24:00] they don't want to incur any additional
[24:02] tax burden from Individual taxpayer
[24:05] right so even though as they target 1
[24:08] million so you just think about that's
[24:10] two micro strategy two strategy company
[24:13] right so of course there will be several
[24:17] per of a Bitcoin but I think before that
[24:20] whatever amount of a Bitcoin they they
[24:22] hold they buy and
[24:24] hold then I think the more meaningful
[24:27] way immediately is that the the impact
[24:30] to other other country to other other
[24:34] other major country because since
[24:37] there's a leader they already announced
[24:39] this they already doing this then the
[24:42] force I mean those congressmen will
[24:44] force other country to study right the
[24:47] government to study why Bitcoin is
[24:49] important I mean I'm talking about major
[24:51] like a G7 all those major emerging
[24:54] country like a China or yeah other right
[24:58] because this is something we cannot
[25:01] ignore anymore so I think this because
[25:05] of
[25:06] this accumulate bcoin by more country
[25:09] and also this will bring the new
[25:13] regulation to make it more more clarity
[25:16] right so when when when there there
[25:21] people in those country want to buy
[25:23] Bitcoin right or the company Corporation
[25:26] we already have those like like a tax
[25:30] clear tax for ifis already and also
[25:33] fastp this year so company can can
[25:36] accumulate Bitcoin already so we'll make
[25:39] all the all all thing clear then more
[25:43] country more institution more
[25:45] Corporation more individual will feel
[25:48] this is a legitimate to all I think this
[25:51] is the most meaningful part for the
[25:54] exactly order sign today that's
[25:56] interesting the global game the of of
[25:58] that as you just mentioned of like uh
[26:00] now the leader of America Donald Trump
[26:04] is now signing an executive order yes
[26:06] which means uh it's now confirmed and
[26:09] not just uh an an uh election promise
[26:14] that he made or like oh he went to the
[26:16] conference and this is great but now he
[26:18] actually signed it which is a signal to
[26:21] China to India to America I was like oh
[26:25] like they're doing that yeah so we
[26:27] basically now have the obligation to
[26:30] really investigate that seriously uh and
[26:34] if you investigate Bitcoin seriously
[26:37] even if you I believe even if you hate
[26:40] Bitcoin uh and all it it stands for you
[26:44] have to get
[26:45] some it's like if you're running the
[26:48] risk risk of Bitcoin might catch on and
[26:51] you lose out on that even if you don't
[26:54] like the maybe you're a communist and
[26:56] you're like I don't like that that
[26:58] Bitcoin thing even like even China um
[27:01] even if the they like Capital controls
[27:03] and all those things even they should
[27:05] actually say like oh like we should not
[27:07] allow it for our citizens but let's buy
[27:10] some just in case it really catches on
[27:12] yeah yeah not the dial and I mean even
[27:14] not not encouraging for citizen as the
[27:17] money transfer because of the control
[27:19] however the country level right the
[27:22] Central Bank level they can buy they can
[27:25] own just like Al right so I think this
[27:28] is the more meaningful because also one
[27:31] thing I want to mention is I've been
[27:33] thinking about this for a while as well
[27:36] uh the good government what we I mean
[27:38] Bitcoin even will help we are talking
[27:40] about the the country adoption already
[27:43] like government adoption already right
[27:45] since today then uh I think it's more
[27:48] meaningful is that what what the
[27:50] definition of a good government indeed
[27:52] Bitcoin can help I mean from the
[27:54] treasury side from the from the country
[27:57] Reserve side to make a good government
[28:01] become more outstanding for example the
[28:05] last three year the best example is Nai
[28:08] in elado right because when one man he's
[28:12] doing all the thing right he of course
[28:14] bigcoin is just one of his many many
[28:16] policy for accumulate Bitcoin but you
[28:19] see the how popular he is over 90% right
[28:23] he always is very longly to be stay at
[28:26] the top right because he he doing all
[28:29] the thing crack down those those scan
[28:31] right all the thing make the country the
[28:33] small small country so good I I I say I
[28:37] visi there right I experience that
[28:39] that's true I can drive a car I can run
[28:41] a car it's no problem I think three
[28:44] times safety no problem at all so that's
[28:47] why is so popular so Bitcoin just the
[28:50] one thing so which mean you can
[28:53] recognize Bitcoin is the new digital
[28:56] goal right it's important and also is
[28:58] give people certain sovereignty right
[29:00] good sovereignty then government give up
[29:05] uh control the money right this is
[29:07] otherwise nowaday most government right
[29:11] I mean except those are small country
[29:13] they use US dollar as their currency
[29:15] like I before and now they they want to
[29:18] control the money they want to control
[29:20] the currency so it's easier to to PR to
[29:24] to what do whatever so Bitcoin bring the
[29:27] behavior of for government to be Chang
[29:29] in the future then this kind of
[29:31] government will become more popular like
[29:33] Nai so you know this is we we think
[29:36] about I mean the now the new president I
[29:38] mean like a na K like a other country
[29:41] even like for example I also know her uh
[29:45] Maya from Surinam right hopefully she
[29:48] got elected in a few months then you
[29:50] know it's a young president and with the
[29:53] new mind right so with this kind of uh
[29:58] toally new mindset right and Trea
[30:01] Bitcoin as good I think other other
[30:04] thing she or he are doing will be also
[30:08] good just like a
[30:10] buetti so this is important I think
[30:12] let's take a break for a moment and
[30:14] appreciate the beauty that coin
[30:17] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:19] watches those watches are the most
[30:22] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[30:25] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[30:28] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:31] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:34] watch collections you have the date of
[30:37] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:40] there and of course also the block
[30:42] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:46] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:48] in this masterpiece make sure to check
[30:51] out those amazing coin vigilante the
[30:53] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[30:56] love those watches so so much and now if
[30:59] you have Bitcoin I really do hope that
[31:02] you don't have it on Exchange but if you
[31:04] do have it on Exchange I have two ways
[31:06] for you to deal with that the first way
[31:08] is you put it on a hardware wallet
[31:10] that's the entry for you to get into the
[31:13] self- custody game I recommend bitbox
[31:17] Bitcoin only Edition for that it's a
[31:19] super simple and secure way and if you
[31:22] check out the link in the description
[31:24] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:27] Robin and the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:30] way the Bitcoin way is your Allin
[31:33] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:36] out of your sovereignty they will
[31:39] personalize for you a self custody setup
[31:42] that is perfect for your individual
[31:45] situation they will show you how you can
[31:47] secure your own devices securing your
[31:50] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[31:52] keep all your devices secure one topic
[31:55] that is overlooked often is the inherent
[31:58] plan what happens with your Bitcoin once
[32:01] you are no longer here do you have a
[32:04] plan for that in place already and last
[32:06] but not least if you're in jurisdictions
[32:08] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[32:11] get a plan B for all that head over to
[32:14] the Bitcoin way.com
[32:16] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[32:20] just a quick side note I will be for the
[32:23] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[32:25] Prague event in June it will will be
[32:28] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[32:30] looking forward to seeing all of you
[32:32] there you can get your ticket in the
[32:35] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[32:37] Brock and very important use code Robin
[32:40] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[32:43] looking forward seeing you there there
[32:45] are two really interesting things n
[32:47] maybe the first one what do you think is
[32:49] the the impact uh of adopting Bitcoin
[32:53] for countries will will it long-term um
[32:57] make government went smaller or like
[32:59] what do you think if we spin that a
[33:01] little bit further and Bitcoin is become
[33:03] more more popular and more and bigger
[33:05] and bigger this probably means also that
[33:08] fear currencies and other assets getting
[33:11] smaller because the has exactly what do
[33:14] you think is does that mean for for
[33:16] government government okay yeah good
[33:18] question D I think Government Can can
[33:20] spend more focus on two thing why is
[33:23] doing the good thing then get more
[33:24] popular like again like a president bti
[33:27] and second thing is the government can
[33:29] focus is energy on doing something by
[33:32] recognition of a Bitcoin exist in their
[33:34] country even though not legal tender yet
[33:36] but at least this is the base just like
[33:39] a goal before 100 years ago more than
[33:42] right you you can focus on doing other
[33:44] thing after adopting the Bitcoin
[33:45] standard or at least put Bitcoin as a
[33:48] reserve so there's many other thing
[33:50] government can do right so I mean just a
[33:54] little bit different definition on the
[33:57] monetary side
[33:58] yeah it's almost like on your personal
[34:00] side because let's say you're an doctor
[34:03] uh but you preserve your financial
[34:05] energy you have to be a portfolio
[34:07] manager also like you have to pick
[34:08] stocks you have to find the right ETFs
[34:10] and stuff like that but now we have
[34:12] Bitcoin you can be a doctor just save
[34:14] your money in Bitcoin focus on the your
[34:17] technical thing your professional you
[34:20] can focus again on savings lives versus
[34:23] uh running a portfolio yeah yeah yeah
[34:25] yeah yeah very good analogy yes yes yes
[34:27] yes exactly I think this apply to all
[34:30] other industry and also government too
[34:32] and also uh because you did investing on
[34:35] such a high level and and I was actually
[34:37] a let's call it a stock Pro before and
[34:40] and that's why I like your your head
[34:41] because it was a big Tesla investor I
[34:43] really like the company still I drove
[34:45] his car for 11 years you in China no no
[34:49] more like this my sixth Tesla oh six
[34:52] Tesla yeah have two one in China One in
[34:54] Taiwan what what did you try all of them
[34:56] to all of is that model 3 Model 3 never
[35:00] no because I got model Y and I have a
[35:03] Model S in China early day because that
[35:05] that time 2014 only model X and also I
[35:08] have a model X in us before a couple
[35:10] year I I I I spent a lot of time there
[35:13] it's funny because I only had model
[35:15] three it's good it's good car it's
[35:17] definitely a good car yeah absolutely
[35:19] yeah but always buy the new new model
[35:22] right I mean when like a model wire I
[35:25] would encourage you buy the always like
[35:26] a technology product like phone right
[35:28] you want to buy the new one oh I I have
[35:30] I don't know if I ever have it but I
[35:33] always have the old one no no it's okay
[35:35] I know what I'm saying is that when you
[35:36] want to want to change when you I want
[35:38] upgrade yeah like I also use the last
[35:41] Model too but I get tired of doing all
[35:45] the app configuration so I think I can
[35:47] use every iPhone for two year but then I
[35:49] always buy the new one no I just just I
[35:52] was actually also like that where I
[35:54] always had the newest a actually uh but
[35:57] uh last year uh since I started the
[36:00] company um uh since I now and maybe this
[36:04] changes again if if the company is more
[36:06] successful but uh I just started the
[36:08] company and I looked actually at every
[36:10] single small thing that I have in my
[36:12] life uh and more than Bitcoin having my
[36:16] own company and being responsible for
[36:18] all my income and all my expenses made
[36:20] me realize okay what do I really need
[36:23] and I was like okay my phone like I
[36:25] don't need it for uh recording I have a
[36:28] camera uh so I don't need the best
[36:30] camera uh and I downgraded from an
[36:33] iPhone I think 13 or 14 pro Max like L
[36:38] the biggest ones to an iPhone 11 okay I
[36:42] see because I was like yeah I don't I
[36:44] don't need it different energy and also
[36:45] I think I understand what you're saying
[36:47] I mean agree and also put more saving in
[36:50] Bitcoin exactly that's also Bitcoin we
[36:54] don't change Bitcoin but Bitcoin changes
[36:56] it definitely like Bitcoin changed
[36:58] changed me in that regard but have I
[37:01] think having my own company actually
[37:03] changed me even more but maybe this this
[37:05] change yeah yeah definitely you are in
[37:07] the in the in the right move everything
[37:09] yeah that's why when you invite me I'm
[37:12] happy to come to to be interviewed by by
[37:15] you yeah really we we we met in Alro I
[37:18] think first adopting yeah adop with yeah
[37:22] uh but maybe back on on on the topic of
[37:24] of of of game f even though might want
[37:27] to go a little bit to Tesla later um
[37:30] when we have now America making the
[37:32] moves um I think EU uh we can kind of
[37:36] summarize they want to regulate it more
[37:38] but they don't want to touch it in any
[37:40] meaningful way way at least that's how I
[37:42] look at it how do you look at uh all the
[37:45] Asia regions of like China maybe like
[37:48] India and and all those big players that
[37:50] have like huge resources huge like so
[37:53] many people there um are they currently
[37:58] um treating Bitcoin and how do you think
[38:00] they will treat it in in the future okay
[38:02] uh let me comment on even though I I
[38:05] don't understand too much on India but
[38:07] let me com briefly on India later I talk
[38:09] more on China which I been more familiar
[38:11] with uh I think India will try to try to
[38:15] look at and also maybe possibly do
[38:17] whatever us want to do because uh you
[38:20] know the China and India the
[38:22] relationships not good in recent year I
[38:25] think India tried to get more close with
[38:28] the US even though I don't know whether
[38:30] Trump like him or not but anyway I think
[38:33] that's the we can see what interesting
[38:35] move India will do but because is also
[38:39] large country back to China I think
[38:41] China as I say I've been there almost 20
[38:44] years I moved from Taiwan to live in
[38:47] China I I live in major city szen
[38:49] Beijing Shanghai okay then I see the the
[38:53] evolving the change of China over the
[38:55] last two decade so I think it is
[38:58] evidence what I've been believe in early
[39:00] day I think China government very smart
[39:04] very smart whatever they they've been
[39:05] doing that's why K me now the is a
[39:08] really big threat to us already indeed I
[39:11] mean a lot of thing is already over it's
[39:14] already surpass us already that's why
[39:17] Trump want to do those tariffs thing you
[39:19] know too so it's a it's a different era
[39:21] now so I would say again China
[39:24] government top official are quite smart
[39:26] even though maybe they make some mistake
[39:29] a few years ago when ban the mining when
[39:31] ban the the I mean because of we
[39:34] understand the capital control of course
[39:35] is a capital control for country like
[39:39] China however I I think uh the the the
[39:42] top official is quite wise and even
[39:44] though they start to
[39:46] study uh in their mind maybe Bitcoin and
[39:50] crypto digital asset that kind of thing
[39:52] they haven't differentiate yet right
[39:55] then but let been restudying over the
[39:57] last few months since Trump get elected
[40:00] I would say you know that's something I
[40:02] can share for this part so I believe
[40:06] based on as I say the top official they
[40:09] they are always for example let me give
[40:11] you another example not related to
[40:13] bitcoin to crypto Tesla when Tesla
[40:18] signed a deal with the China a Shanghai
[40:20] government I think back to 2017 or
[40:24] 18 Tesla become the first wholly own
[40:28] subsidiary of auto manufacturing in
[40:31] China before the last 30 year is 5050
[40:35] like Volkswagen right BMW always Toyota
[40:39] 50/50 that's that's mean but tesda
[40:41] become the first one because it's a EV
[40:44] then China government want to embrace EV
[40:46] so they sign this deal specifically for
[40:49] Tesla
[40:50] only and you see now I think 60% of the
[40:53] worldwide manufacturing of Tesla 2024 is
[40:56] from China from that Shanghai Giga
[40:58] Factory and also not only this this
[41:03] help promote all the supply of the EV
[41:06] automobile component of China now I
[41:10] think I believe why Tesla can sell lower
[41:13] price in China
[41:15] versus other us or German uh Berlin
[41:19] Factory m is because the lower cost of
[41:22] Sur which local I think 90 or 95% make
[41:26] by local and then this also help bring
[41:30] up the very strong supply chain of a
[41:34] China EV industry and now it's not only
[41:38] I think China EV sell the new new car
[41:41] sell e is already over 50% last year the
[41:45] original goal is 2020 33 35 but now it's
[41:49] achieved 2024 11 year earlier and not
[41:52] only this but also it export maybe you
[41:55] don't feel that much in Europe however
[41:58] if you go to Latin America if you go to
[42:00] other country other emerging country
[42:03] Chinese Chinese car Chinese EV is
[42:07] everywhere yeah you can look at the data
[42:10] so I mean so this this is such a wise
[42:13] move it's a win-win it's a win-win for
[42:15] Tesla for China government for the China
[42:18] industry so you see recent year China
[42:20] economy is not was not good because of
[42:22] the house market bubble the real estate
[42:24] bubble still under the correction
[42:27] however the the the the the the economy
[42:32] is being fully supported by this kind of
[42:34] export in the hardware in the automobile
[42:37] in the Drone in the low what kind of
[42:39] thing so so I I use this example maybe I
[42:43] talk a little bit far however you know I
[42:45] think back to the financial and monetary
[42:49] I think they are studying I I don't know
[42:51] I'm I'm just the from my judgment right
[42:54] then but I know there there are holding
[42:57] some meeting and then that would be
[42:59] something they can do without violate
[43:02] their other policy like a capital
[43:04] control so accumulate Co just like a of
[43:09] course now you can see from the last two
[43:11] years after the ukan war uh the Russia
[43:14] Ukraine war they accumulate go right
[43:17] they love go which is a physical and
[43:19] also is a centralized control is good
[43:21] right so I don't think there's a no any
[43:25] reason no reason to ask some Bitcoin as
[43:29] part of the gold Reserve after the US is
[43:33] moving forward so that's my that's my
[43:36] answer I think when China doing that of
[43:39] course other small country in Asia will
[43:43] I also like the the digital gold
[43:46] narrative because I think it's it's
[43:47] really uh one that people can understand
[43:51] easily and they're like oh okay gold I
[43:55] get um and and I think it's way harder
[43:58] to sell Bitcoin currently as a currency
[44:01] of like oh like Bitcoin replace the Euro
[44:04] then you're like oh like scaling issues
[44:05] like oh where can I use it it it's like
[44:08] 16 years in the making and and still
[44:09] cannot use it so I feel like digital
[44:11] gold is an easier uh narrative for for
[44:15] for Bitcoin to win yeah if I I believe
[44:18] you you and I we read Bitcoin standard
[44:20] right if you understand how the money
[44:22] come from right it's always always go
[44:24] come from first is as a store of value
[44:28] right until maybe someday some year
[44:31] later most people most people in the
[44:33] world recognize Bitcoin is the one of
[44:36] the I think should be the best no second
[44:38] best store of value then gradually it
[44:41] will become media exchange right maybe
[44:43] some some some count saying oh we don't
[44:46] want to use the US dollar as our our
[44:49] default currency anymore then maybe we
[44:51] use the Bitcoin since that's a lining or
[44:53] maybe L another you will improve lining
[44:55] for example other technology
[44:57] then gradually then maybe there a new
[45:00] system to come so from store value to
[45:04] Media exchange and and finally become
[45:07] you account so I we don't know how long
[45:09] it take maybe several decades but given
[45:12] now we are in the digital age usually
[45:15] the thing change is faster than before
[45:19] yeah I had this great chart and maybe I
[45:20] can put it in the post production for
[45:23] the people to see but uh it basically
[45:25] showed the adop rate of like electricity
[45:29] the adoption rate of the car and and and
[45:31] things like that and then you see the
[45:33] adoption rate of like the internet and
[45:36] smartphones and then like yeah and all
[45:39] those things like they they go way
[45:42] faster but then it's also um like one
[45:46] that would be the one thing of like okay
[45:47] Bitcoin will go way faster than than
[45:49] than we expect but then uh one thing
[45:52] that I also I'm wondering Bitcoin is
[45:55] also money so there's a real opportunity
[45:57] cost if you adopt I don't know like
[45:59] Facebook or like something on your phone
[46:01] there's not a real opportunity cost for
[46:04] for the phone you just like get a new
[46:06] device yeah more efficient exactly and
[46:10] and for money you have to basically sell
[46:13] your assets your currency your ETFs
[46:16] whatever and move it to bitcoin so
[46:18] that's real opportunity cost so the
[46:20] network effect of of money I think is
[46:24] way stronger than for new app
[46:27] yeah I think that's I say earlier
[46:29] because is more sophisticated more
[46:31] complicated because it involves with
[46:33] money especially money cost I think it's
[46:36] a sah say 50% of the problem of the
[46:39] world right so money is a key thing
[46:41] because it's related to all people's
[46:44] economy right living family Corporation
[46:47] so money is the different we so that's
[46:49] why the revolution of it I mean from
[46:51] internet right the revolution is only
[46:53] for information not on the money side
[46:55] before and now we see it's coming it's a
[46:58] more sophisticated more complicated
[47:01] however we also you also mentioned the
[47:03] digital age maybe faster so I think this
[47:05] B were offset let's see how but still I
[47:09] I believe it should be faster than
[47:11] electricity faster L car maybe at least
[47:16] as fast as the internet I think that's
[47:18] good enough like a 20 to 30 years yeah
[47:21] and there's this great picture also um
[47:24] of New York City in 19 uh o and in
[47:28] 19133 uh and the first picture shows all
[47:31] horse carriages I won two cars and then
[47:35] 13 years later it's like there's still
[47:37] horses on the street but mostly cars
[47:39] yeah uh so uh I'm also wondering we
[47:42] probably hit one point in an adoption
[47:45] rate curve where we look back the past
[47:49] five 10 years and like oh like we we all
[47:51] kind of use Bitcoin now uh there's still
[47:54] some fear like even today if you go in
[47:57] Vienna actually uh in the middle of the
[47:59] city I don't know if also on week
[48:01] weekdays but on Sundays for sure there's
[48:03] horse carriages oh oh yeah yeah yeah I
[48:06] saw one uh on the way here oh great so
[48:08] so so horse carriages are still here
[48:11] like 100 years later like more like a
[48:14] culture of entertainment that kind of
[48:16] thing exactly but the car is dominant
[48:18] okay and maybe uh that's also with with
[48:22] with money uh what I'm looking at is
[48:24] like Bitcoin will be dominant and maybe
[48:27] 10 20 years but there will still be uh
[48:31] maybe China has their their their own
[48:33] version of a digital uh uh currency then
[48:37] the us will have like their the cbdcs
[48:40] like maybe or whatever stable
[48:42] coin whatever whatever do um do you look
[48:46] at that kind of future or at some point
[48:48] Bitcoin will just completely override I
[48:51] think we can we can we can watch on one
[48:54] uh very important matches yeah as I
[48:57] mention I I I I work for bank before 20
[48:59] years ago and I think the banking
[49:01] adoption since now the money all the
[49:03] globally all the money related is bank
[49:06] is the the major vehicle right to from
[49:10] Central Bank and also for those whatever
[49:13] the capital ratio res Reserve ratio and
[49:16] also the global remittance bank right
[49:19] Commercial Bank still the majority Major
[49:22] Force so let's see how the because we
[49:25] cannot because oh even though Trump sign
[49:28] the SB then we cannot ignore those bank
[49:31] right so Bank is still dominate maybe I
[49:34] think 90% over 90% of the Global
[49:37] Financial system Commercial Bank okay so
[49:41] let's see how the Commercial Bank work
[49:44] for the next few year I believe very
[49:47] likely I think I believe us also already
[49:49] started I think it will be go faster
[49:51] from today is the custody of a Bitcoin
[49:54] by Bank okay this will the the first
[49:58] most likely move for because inde you
[50:01] own Bitcoin you you you don't need a
[50:02] bank right the bank however we still the
[50:05] Global Financial system is dominated by
[50:07] bank so however so that's why we have to
[50:09] we have to accommodate you have to
[50:11] combine right we are not that oh I'm the
[50:13] Bitcoin I'm the the prep right so okay
[50:16] let's face the reality so Bank
[50:19] regulation for Bank to cust the the
[50:21] Bitcoin for not only people like us we
[50:24] have our own private key but for many
[50:27] other maybe less sophisticated people
[50:30] and also for Corporation and for
[50:32] institution right they cannot
[50:33] institutional Corporation they cannot
[50:35] trust on one single person say CFO or
[50:38] all the private key all the institution
[50:41] investor who are they going to tr they
[50:43] going to trust someone they trust
[50:45] already which is bank or related right
[50:48] so I think Bank indeed that's the major
[50:50] function of a bank Commercial Bank for
[50:53] Bitcoin
[50:54] era otherwise what I like going to do
[50:57] right yeah so Bank cost the Bitcoin and
[51:00] with the clear liation and gradually
[51:03] they can even can send Bitcoin help
[51:07] their client send Bitcoin
[51:09] globally right other country like say
[51:11] China or Hong Kong or Singapore they
[51:13] also accept it then I think this network
[51:16] effect will kick it and
[51:19] then the adoption Fe speed will accessor
[51:24] yeah the the the banks are
[51:27] I think one of the major trigger points
[51:30] to make that the Catalyst exactly there
[51:32] to make that possible because people
[51:36] still like most people have a bank
[51:38] account like even me also you Trust Bank
[51:40] exactly you trust trust bank and I'm
[51:43] also thinking of like maybe my
[51:46] generation is different and they're like
[51:47] oh like let's download that wallet and
[51:49] stuff like that but when I think about
[51:52] uh my my grandma for example um or my
[51:55] granddad he earning 80 this year uh he
[51:59] he he will not do like self custody and
[52:01] doing the the wallets uh he is a he is a
[52:04] bank and and his main bank but if the
[52:07] main bank representative says like oh
[52:09] like you you can you could do some some
[52:11] Bitcoin diversication it's a new thing
[52:13] and he like oh yeah I heard my grandson
[52:17] talking about that let do like
[52:19] 5% I think there's like a lot of those
[52:22] uh trigger points where sometimes we too
[52:25] close to into this oh how is H Bitcoin
[52:28] shaking up but we need the financial
[52:30] space yes yes that's why I'm saying I my
[52:33] my experience working for traditional
[52:35] financial banking before and technology
[52:37] company that's how I can have a I I I I
[52:40] I I think I'm more stronger belief this
[52:42] should be the way to to go and also you
[52:45] yeah you you think about the when
[52:48] majority of a bank they they adopt it
[52:51] yeah you feel is not only oh we let
[52:55] think about in the I s always like to
[52:57] use the number 900 trillion as of today
[53:00] the global asset right Bitcoin only
[53:03] let's say 2 trillion and right for now
[53:06] so 99% over still I think majority of
[53:09] asset is owned by traditional financial
[53:12] institution or may be custody by
[53:14] traditional financial institution yeah
[53:17] so they have to right adopt it then that
[53:21] can accelerate the adoption of a Bitcoin
[53:24] for most of the people who own the 900
[53:28] trillion asset yeah it's super
[53:30] interesting this 900 trillion because um
[53:32] I like Jesse Myers models that the SOS
[53:35] references a lot like that's 900
[53:37] trillion and now let's figure out how
[53:39] much of bit how much can Bitcoin capture
[53:40] off that and there like oh like maybe 10
[53:43] 20% maybe 50% because Bitcoin is money
[53:45] so like 15% of everything should be
[53:48] maybe even higher than that because
[53:50] maybe can Bitcoin can capture a lot of
[53:52] real estate a lot of bonds and and all
[53:54] those things how do you how do you look
[53:57] at uh those 900 trillions and and I mean
[54:00] it's it's impossible to put like a date
[54:03] on that but like U from from a vision
[54:06] perspective like what can Bitcoin
[54:08] accomplish in there two two metric I I
[54:11] thought about when you asking this why
[54:13] is the digitalized versus physical for
[54:16] example real estate the house is a
[54:18] physical for example China the last 30
[54:21] years before this the recent uh house
[54:24] market market bubble no one no one
[54:27] thought
[54:28] about house price will go down even I
[54:32] argue with some friend then we you know
[54:34] I say in Taiwan Hong Kong in us I saw
[54:37] the market G they said no how you buy
[54:39] call this now they realize right so the
[54:43] physical because house is a physical
[54:45] store of value for Chinese people before
[54:48] the last 30 years so you see how how
[54:52] fast the shift from physical to digital
[54:54] that's the one parameter
[54:57] and uh yeah I I think I'm sorry what
[55:01] other question again I just like we have
[55:04] this 900 trillion now Bitcoin is 2
[55:06] trillion uh like what do you as an
[55:09] investor you always look at the total
[55:10] addressable market for for something
[55:13] what is the total addressable market for
[55:14] Bitcoin yeah as I say uh that that the
[55:17] first is how fast people realize the
[55:20] digital is better than physical yeah
[55:22] yeah the other I think uh
[55:26] the what what impact the speed after
[55:28] adoption is that the regulation and also
[55:33] the infrastructure for example as I say
[55:36] those uh regulation and also those
[55:39] custody uh easier for for people to
[55:42] custody and feel safe for trust truste
[55:46] and also for the generation wealth Etc I
[55:49] mean and also of course the return the
[55:52] historical return will also impact
[55:55] people you know
[55:56] this is the investors dilemma always I
[55:59] won't say dilemma is a kind of a
[56:01] phenomenon when you see the asset price
[56:04] go up then always you chase on the asset
[56:08] just like you see on Twitter on X right
[56:10] say oh when Bitcoin is 80s 80k then very
[56:13] few people W other one bco is a 200k
[56:16] always make many people but because of
[56:20] this this indeed I I like this kind of a
[56:23] graph which mean is the formal
[56:27] however if apply to other asset even any
[56:30] other
[56:31] Equity house I not only house but even
[56:34] like Nvidia right over 3 3.5 trillion
[56:38] and now it's back to 2.8 maybe it's
[56:40] further down right for example you know
[56:43] because that's the centralized entity
[56:46] company but when people got formal I
[56:48] think that also will help because why
[56:51] because Bitcoin is absolute scarcity
[56:54] that's the different everywhere never
[56:56] before and it's so you see there a
[56:59] several parameter yeah and it's also
[57:01] super uh super interesting of when you
[57:03] look at real estate because especially
[57:05] in Austria I don't know how it's in
[57:06] other countries but I guess similar it's
[57:09] really used as the savings vehicle it's
[57:12] traditional like own a family they buy
[57:14] the house they have like a mortgage on
[57:16] that they have a credit line so like for
[57:18] 20 years 30 years 15 years whatever the
[57:20] the the years is they try to pay it off
[57:23] and they actually see the house as their
[57:27] kind of retirement and savings vehicle
[57:31] and a lot of austrians colleagues even
[57:34] like uh from the uh nor World they say
[57:38] they say to me like oh like you have
[57:40] those that Bitcoin stack what why don't
[57:42] you put something in in in a house or
[57:45] like use it as a for initial payment for
[57:47] a house like that mindset is really in
[57:50] there yeah but once that switches this
[57:53] will put a lot of capital in Bitcoin
[57:56] which will then uh make housing
[57:58] affordable again I think that's
[58:00] something we don't talk of enough about
[58:02] yeah oh yeah so that that's why I mean
[58:04] your point remind me the other parameter
[58:07] is that the the wealth control by what
[58:11] kind of people for example if the 900
[58:14] trillion asset today is controlled by
[58:16] younger generation even like you right
[58:19] let's say 30 40 in the Liv in the
[58:22] internet age then that would be
[58:24] different that would be much faster m
[58:26] however this kind of maybe I mean you
[58:30] see Generation by generation right still
[58:32] old the money like a warant buffet those
[58:35] right they still control a lot of asset
[58:37] so you know so this generation shift the
[58:42] speed however I think because of when
[58:44] bitcoin price keep going up and even
[58:46] other crypto price right let's say the
[58:48] new regulation come in some good project
[58:51] they become a very legit to all with
[58:54] some use case let's say then more and
[58:56] more younger generation on bitcoin on
[58:58] crypto asset
[59:01] then maybe more wealthy right just like
[59:04] Elon Musk he he buil Tesla right the new
[59:08] EV and he become the richest man in the
[59:10] world same thing Michael S own Bitcoin
[59:13] then how many own Bitcoin he become the
[59:15] richest guy in the world same thing
[59:17] right more and more crypto people that
[59:19] what called the uh the billionaire FP
[59:21] something like that then then this will
[59:24] also assess and when those of physical
[59:28] traditional asset getting less than less
[59:31] value than today then I think this this
[59:35] this shift
[59:36] will maybe we'll see maybe I think will
[59:39] be 10 year do you do you think Michael
[59:43] sa has the chance of of being the
[59:45] richest uh man man life of course of
[59:48] course I believe I I keep saying that
[59:50] for over one year to France I hope he
[59:53] keep healthy he keep you know that's
[59:57] something I mean he he he demonstrate
[60:00] yeah this is also he he already tell
[60:02] people right when when when he die then
[60:06] the the the Bitcoin is going to do on
[60:09] right it's going to be gone then then
[60:13] it's a
[60:14] charity that's really
[60:17] something uh did did he say that he give
[60:20] it just away with with throwing what
[60:22] destroy the private key oh yeah yeah
[60:25] yeah he say that he say that several
[60:26] timeses I'm sure really cool I didn't do
[60:29] that actually cool one intervie that's
[60:32] that's the biggest charity that that can
[60:34] make to humanity right yeah yeah yeah so
[60:36] she's doing the lot he's a really Echo
[60:38] what stle she spr uh like satosi also
[60:43] most likely did with the first million
[60:45] Bitcoin I I don't think that he has
[60:47] access to it even if he is alive and
[60:49] stuff like that yeah indeed the one
[60:51] thing you know remind me some people
[60:53] also mention about even today uh
[60:55] mentioned when 19 uh 1930s uh when the
[61:00] exective order to to to to bang go
[61:02] people on goal they say ah since the US
[61:05] government is only Bitcoin I mean don't
[61:07] forget the privacy of a individual
[61:10] something like
[61:11] that I'm
[61:12] not I think most likely the government
[61:16] Trump or the next president won't do
[61:19] such a thing as what they did in 1933 or
[61:22] 34 yeah I think because it's a totally
[61:25] different era yeah right we already as I
[61:29] mentioned right like a na K case right
[61:31] if if the government doing good thing
[61:34] then it will become more popular it the
[61:35] country will get stronger right I think
[61:39] this is the only one threat when US
[61:42] Government own more Bitcoin when
[61:44] coinbase when other institution bre Rock
[61:46] own more Bitcoin through EDF or whatever
[61:50] then oh that's a centralized then
[61:51] government can yeah the one thing I'm
[61:54] looking at with that is we now have the
[61:57] internet and we now have verifiable
[62:00] blockchain so if they do something um
[62:04] they might uh come along like FDX
[62:08] basically did it like they had what was
[62:10] it two free Bitcoin in their reserves
[62:13] and just giving out hundreds and
[62:15] thousands of Bitcoins to to users so
[62:17] basically they were fractally reserving
[62:19] for for their own users yeah so yes uh
[62:23] black Ro could also do it uh coinbase
[62:25] could also Do It um but I think it's
[62:28] only a short term like it could only be
[62:31] maybe a few years where they could do it
[62:33] at some point um Dynamics will come like
[62:37] FDX especially with the internet where
[62:41] you you cannot suppress anything if you
[62:44] only have newspapers and and two TV
[62:46] channels it's easier yeah it's a
[62:48] different yeah you magical point now the
[62:51] Twitter right s right internet is
[62:53] everywhere immediately right so it's a
[62:56] different I so I think the government
[62:58] all the future government won't do that
[63:01] yeah what I'm saying the point is that
[63:03] where the government will Seize Your
[63:04] Bitcoin say oh you give me Bitcoin I
[63:06] give you certain US dollar something
[63:08] like that like what happened 90 years
[63:11] ago yeah yeah I hope and I don't think
[63:14] that will have yeah I don't think I
[63:16] think if we go lure out those kind of
[63:19] risk then
[63:21] everything is clear is there anything
[63:25] else in in risk rise that you're looking
[63:26] at uh for for with people always come to
[63:30] time talk about the quantum Computing
[63:32] thing but I don't think so I've been
[63:33] check with I'm not an expert in Technic
[63:36] technology side but I check with a very
[63:37] good expert friends I think it's this D
[63:42] at that time when content is really be
[63:46] prevailing Bitcoin Network also getting
[63:49] much more stronger and secure and also
[63:51] also back to the incentive side right
[63:56] since is the good thing to oh why you
[63:58] going to to destroy why you going to to
[64:00] right the richest man in the world okay
[64:02] say okay I will do the
[64:05] 51% I I don't think it's most likely
[64:08] also again right because of Bitcoin
[64:10] because of this decentralized making
[64:12] more and more people decentralized you
[64:14] can own your asset you can own the most
[64:16] valuable asset permission list so I I
[64:19] think will be less centralized so
[64:22] therefore the the 51% or over attack
[64:26] will be less less
[64:28] unlikely yeah you see but now today we
[64:30] say before we keep talk about government
[64:32] government B right now today is clear
[64:35] us and now we talk about the technology
[64:38] risk we talk about whether the
[64:40] government will do something on you
[64:41] that's it right and and you will
[64:44] probably uh relate to that a lot I think
[64:47] new technologies always have to prove
[64:49] itself yes like nobody questions the
[64:53] banking accounts quantum uh Pro it no
[64:57] nobody questiones Amazon's Quantum but
[65:01] but Bitcoin has to prove uh yes and gets
[65:04] gets all those but I think that's always
[65:07] natural with new technologies that come
[65:10] they they they have to prove that they
[65:12] are 100x better and have no flaws no
[65:16] yeah yeah I think it should be okay
[65:18] should be okay I've been keep thinking
[65:20] about this this issue too this risk
[65:22] issue yeah now I think the major r
[65:26] because of the new Trump Administration
[65:29] it's already
[65:32] clear um uh one more thing maybe with
[65:35] with the you saw the internet adoption
[65:37] uh and and and you live through that com
[65:41] B you list all those things do you see
[65:44] parallels to to how Bitcoin is now kind
[65:47] of growing up and and and and and coming
[65:50] up to to how TCP and the internet came
[65:53] up yeah very similar very similar uh I
[65:56] think uh we already touch upon those B
[66:00] uh Bank custody regulation and more
[66:04] people adoption and also we have been SE
[66:07] through the 2017 Ico bubble 2018 bubble
[66:10] right and also 20121 the D5 bubble
[66:14] busted by FTS by those Luna Terra those
[66:17] thing and also we we see last year until
[66:21] recently the minan
[66:23] coin something like that so all those
[66:26] surface and Bitcoin of course is still
[66:28] volatile together with because people
[66:30] treat Bitcoin the same as those coin as
[66:33] I mentioned area because it's only been
[66:35] exchang at those unregulated yet crypto
[66:40] exchange right in the future we got
[66:42] regulated I mean coinbase of course is
[66:44] okay yeah so because of this kind of
[66:47] thing make those phenomenal Bitcoin is
[66:49] the price is volatile intended with
[66:51] those all coins up and down and also
[66:54] those all coin
[66:56] I mean pum and dum guys they also do a
[66:59] lot of thing on bitcoin to leverage the
[67:02] right those contract future contract so
[67:04] make the price volatile but this is also
[67:07] the the the the right path to the
[67:10] adoption right more still volatile on
[67:13] the way maybe to for example a million
[67:15] or several million a coin then it will
[67:18] gradually be be more stabilized just
[67:21] like us think about those Bru stock I
[67:23] mean before the Brut equity usually it
[67:26] won't be as volatile as a Tesla or as a
[67:28] Nvidia right so when Bitcoin reach to
[67:31] certain adoption phase it will be less
[67:34] than less volatile so I think we already
[67:36] go through the several cycle of the
[67:40] bubble especially together with those
[67:42] altcoin and now we have more regulation
[67:45] Clarity Bitcoin is Bitcoin the other
[67:47] crypto is a digital asset then I believe
[67:50] still versus the US dollar price versus
[67:53] the Fiat price still Maybe some people
[67:55] say maybe went bcoin half million and
[67:57] crash to
[67:59] 300K in a few day possible right so
[68:01] still this is still because some people
[68:05] want to make shter money some people
[68:07] maybe have some some need Fiat needs to
[68:10] buy house to do whatever think so still
[68:12] buy and sell so this is very normal in a
[68:17] new asset class for adoption yeah this
[68:20] this meere of like oh like Bitcoin went
[68:22] up to to 100,000 now crashed down to
[68:26] bad it was like uhk just a few years ago
[68:30] yeah but I think I would suggest to look
[68:32] at the other chart some people will post
[68:35] and ask is that how many coin let's say
[68:38] now is a is less than 20 million Bitcoin
[68:42] being mind right 90 point something then
[68:45] how many coin uh stay in the exchange
[68:48] sell custody versus in other form I
[68:51] think that's very meaningful so you see
[68:53] the exchange the coin at The Exchange is
[68:56] keep going down and more and more people
[68:59] own the Bitcoin to their own wallet to
[69:01] their self custody or similar do you
[69:04] think the the the supply shock meme uh
[69:07] come at some point where there's so less
[69:10] Bitcoin where we see like
[69:12] a
[69:14] house yeah gr suddenly I think Sams M
[69:19] said that the Omega candle yeah yeah I
[69:22] mean that's always a very good to code
[69:24] but I I think regardless I mean I would
[69:28] say it's past independent but the goal
[69:32] is the same yeah yeah Le is the good one
[69:34] not dependent is a past inde past
[69:36] independent
[69:39] regardless yeah one day or one year or I
[69:42] think it's yeah because I think one
[69:46] thing we got to be sure we are sitting
[69:48] here I mean we are believer is that the
[69:51] the
[69:52] absolute scal fixed supply of for 31
[69:55] million that's the most important
[69:58] part for the whole Bitcoin all the
[70:01] ecosystem we've been talking about
[70:03] because you cannot print more you cannot
[70:06] issue more then when more and more
[70:08] people learn about it realize it and
[70:12] interesting and to to keep it to buy it
[70:15] to hold it then demand Supply economy
[70:21] 101 we know the answer that's really
[70:24] really cool uh um as you as as I
[70:27] mentioned before Tesla is also
[70:28] interesting you probably also are very
[70:31] uh um looking at that company especially
[70:34] because there's an intersection with
[70:36] with Bitcoin uh they are still the only
[70:39] as I understand it they still the only
[70:40] S&P 500 company that holds Bitcoin which
[70:43] is yeah people like to hate on IL musk
[70:46] because he been on Dogecoin and and all
[70:48] those things but um anytime I listen to
[70:52] to him talk I feel like oh he's a
[70:54] Bitcoin like he he knew he knew Bitcoin
[70:56] is a better preserve value than vat
[70:59] which get print so much yeah he he knew
[71:02] he talk about that when when they
[71:04] announced that Cod result they on those
[71:07] Bitcoin the first time yeah he knew he
[71:09] talk about that I remember I listen to
[71:11] what he say yeah and I I I listened to
[71:14] the last podcast he did with Rogan uh
[71:16] that just came out I like three four
[71:18] days ago ago or maybe a week ago uh and
[71:21] he mentioned all the Bitcoin as like oh
[71:23] Social Security is a scam like oh all
[71:25] those Bitcoin talking points and I'm
[71:29] like he he's so so so close to to
[71:31] bitcoin but uh for some reason he's uh
[71:35] not talking about it I think I mean he
[71:37] is quite smart I I I've been trying to
[71:39] see even though you see this few day he
[71:41] didn't TW anything related to the
[71:43] Strategic Bitcoin Reserve I think I
[71:46] guess two reason why is that because he
[71:48] has many to do as a doge right the
[71:50] current Doge and uh just like I
[71:53] mentioned president bueri coin just the
[71:56] small part one part I won't say small
[71:58] part it's one part of white key is busy
[72:00] for every day yeah so it's the same for
[72:03] a businessman like Elon or the Dodge
[72:05] leader helping Trump I think this they
[72:08] are many thing to do and the second
[72:10] point is because this always as I said
[72:12] when you you talk about associate with
[72:14] the money this is always sensitive
[72:17] always sensitive but as I say he already
[72:19] said that he understand Bitcoin could be
[72:21] the better reserve value than US dollar
[72:25] few years ago so I think he knew about
[72:27] that and also of course he is not that
[72:30] expertise particularly on the Bitcoin
[72:33] this kind of network so so for this
[72:35] three reason I don't think yeah yeah he
[72:39] will he will enase too much and also Now
[72:41] with uh Trump has the Davis sax right as
[72:44] the crypto Cesar so I think everything
[72:47] announcement or whatever he say I think
[72:49] that each person take care of a
[72:51] different thing but I agree he still he
[72:55] that he's smart Bitcoin is the best I me
[72:59] is the one of the best for him to to to
[73:01] keep the value really good ask one
[73:04] question to each and every one of my
[73:06] guests and the question is what can we
[73:07] learn from you besides Bitcoin uh yeah
[73:10] good question I mean I I didn't know you
[73:13] were asking this always as I say
[73:16] uh embrace the new thinking of course
[73:20] the technology is always dominant in
[73:23] every generation so always think about
[73:26] what would be the new form of uh living
[73:29] right even for ourself because we know
[73:32] that's the right way then the business
[73:34] will will Thrive as well right so for
[73:37] example in recent year AI right keep
[73:39] talk about AI CH gbd now China come with
[73:42] a DC so you see this two is a thing very
[73:45] interesting not only the AI company
[73:47] compete each other and
[73:48] also I won't say compete but anyway it's
[73:51] kind of a compete also country China and
[73:53] US yeah this two major two largest
[73:57] economy in the world it's is also kind
[74:00] of a compete something like that yeah so
[74:03] always think about what would be the
[74:04] right way to do thing and also
[74:07] appreciate the value right what would be
[74:09] the what would be the most valuable
[74:12] thing to devot your time your resource
[74:15] to
[74:16] do and that's why I mean I mentioned
[74:20] again briefly with Bitcoin because of
[74:23] Bitcoin is my number
[74:26] but of course as I say I
[74:27] spend other time you see I look around
[74:30] different country I look I I I meet
[74:33] different people it can make me think
[74:36] differently and also tip tip in the at
[74:40] least not behind what the world bring us
[74:44] yeah and that's a big thing uh I I
[74:47] learned so much and I my my head
[74:50] expanded a lot last year because I spoke
[74:53] with over 400 different yeah
[74:56] and I also move around a lot now with
[74:59] the conference and stuff like that um we
[75:01] have an end routine in the podcast where
[75:03] the previous guest is asking a question
[75:04] for the next guest without knowing who
[75:06] the next guest is uh I unfortunately
[75:09] just realized we kind of already had
[75:11] that that question in but he asked you
[75:14] of like uh what is the biggest risk to
[75:17] bitcoin we kind of already already I
[75:19] touch touched on that uh just for the
[75:22] viewers to know I I didn't forget about
[75:24] the end go in uh but maybe um uh before
