[00:00] I don't think it's unrealistic at all to
[00:02] think that Bitcoin could 10x from here
[00:03] the first thing that draws people in is
[00:05] the price and if Bitcoin 10 xes from
[00:07] here in the short short to medium term
[00:10] then you're going to get a lot more
[00:11] activist shareholders saying why don't
[00:13] we have exposure to this that's the
[00:14] point at which the career risk flips
[00:16] because people can see you know it's 10x
[00:18] from here and at the same time the value
[00:20] of my pounds has diminished by X amounts
[00:24] destroyed by inflation the question then
[00:26] becomes why aren't I invested in this
[00:27] rather than why should I invest in this
[00:29] Lawrence Le calls a Bitcoin a hedge
[00:31] against sovereign debt default which I
[00:34] don't think is an is an unrealistic risk
[00:37] given how heavily indebted so many
[00:38] countries are and more importantly what
[00:40] their Debt Service burden looks like
[00:42] what other system can you point to
[00:43] that's had more than 10 years worth of
[00:45] continuous up time not a single one no
[00:47] Bank no telecommunications Network
[00:49] absolutely nothing bitcoin's just been
[00:50] chugging
[00:51] [Music]
[00:55] away let's talk about uh Bitcoin policy
[00:59] UK and FCA that's that's kind of the the
[01:01] topics I think what we cover mostly
[01:03] today absolutely um well uh I'm I'm
[01:06] happy to sort of start at the beginning
[01:08] with the uh relationship between UK's uh
[01:13] decision-making bodies and and Bitcoin
[01:15] if that's a helpful thing for your
[01:16] listeners yeah let's get directly
[01:19] started with that um um with that I
[01:22] think we can directly start with that
[01:24] what is the relationship between uh
[01:26] Bitcoin and the the bodies there it's a
[01:29] little disappointing to be completely
[01:31] honest particularly when you consider
[01:33] the uh tradition of um computer science
[01:36] and cryptographers in the United Kingdom
[01:39] you might have thought that this would
[01:41] be a jurisdiction that would be excited
[01:43] to uh have a a leading role in this area
[01:47] Adam back of course was originally a
[01:49] Brit uh he'll be well known to everyone
[01:51] who listens to your show and we've got a
[01:54] reasonably proud tradition as well you
[01:56] know Tim berners Le is another name that
[01:58] I might reel off
[02:00] um you know our computer scientists have
[02:02] traditionally been among the finest in
[02:05] the world and it's a shame that that uh
[02:10] pioneering Spirit doesn't translate into
[02:12] the way that the UK appears to make
[02:14] regulations or understand the uh the
[02:17] protocol itself we can dig down a little
[02:20] bit into some of the some of what I
[02:22] think are the reasons why that has
[02:24] happened but in summary the general
[02:28] position of the United Kingdom to
[02:30] towards uh the cryptocurrency space in
[02:32] general and Bitcoin in particular has
[02:34] not been a welcoming
[02:36] one uh so back in the day when the
[02:40] various different bodies first became
[02:42] aware of uh aware of Bitcoin the
[02:44] messaging was very much this is a
[02:46] speculative asset with no intrinsic
[02:48] value all of the usual buzzwords that
[02:50] you'll be familiar with perhaps it's
[02:52] helpful for for your listeners for me to
[02:54] set out the exact bodies that I'm
[02:56] talking about so in the UK obviously the
[02:59] central bank is is known as the bank of
[03:01] England the uh hmrc that I'll refer to
[03:04] as well stands for his or her Majesty's
[03:07] revenue and customs and that's our tax
[03:09] body the equivalent of the IRS in the
[03:11] United States uh the FCA is the
[03:14] financial conduct Authority its
[03:17] predecessor was the FSA the Financial
[03:19] Services Authority they did such a bad
[03:21] job at spotting and preventing the
[03:23] financial crisis that they were
[03:26] essentially disbanded and then recreated
[03:28] as the FCA
[03:30] and then we obviously have uh the
[03:32] treasury Department then which does
[03:34] exactly what it says on the
[03:36] tin uh and then the obviously the the
[03:39] lawmaking body in the United Kingdom is
[03:41] Parliament and that's split into two
[03:43] houses here like a lot of countries and
[03:45] we have the House of Commons and the
[03:46] House of Lords it's a by Camal system
[03:49] similar to the United
[03:50] States and the behind all of this all of
[03:55] those uh regulatory bodies sit a civil
[03:58] service which is entially is is more
[04:00] powerful in some respects than the
[04:02] actual ministers and members of
[04:04] parliament themselves because it's the
[04:06] civil servants who really drill down
[04:09] into into subject matter and decide
[04:11] policy uh so that's that's a bit of
[04:14] scene setting uh and you know we're not
[04:17] we're not unique here most countries
[04:19] will have a similarly large set of
[04:21] different bodies who all do similar
[04:24] things
[04:25] um and unfortunately the UK is is
[04:30] relatively unique in having had a very
[04:32] very sophisticated and wellestablished
[04:34] financial services
[04:36] industry um one of the things that
[04:38] United Kingdom has traditionally been
[04:40] famous for going back a really long way
[04:42] actually if you go back as far as the
[04:44] Crusades for example the decision to
[04:49] split uh the types of ownership between
[04:52] legal ownership and beneficial ownership
[04:54] and really the creation of trust law in
[04:57] its very earliest form was uh British
[05:01] well as it was as it was then decision
[05:03] uh and you know quite quite a
[05:05] fantastically Innovative piece of of
[05:07] legal thinking um sadly we're no longer
[05:11] as Innovative as we were in the Middle
[05:13] Ages uh and if we haven't ourselves
[05:15] invented something there seems to be a
[05:17] lot of push back in the United Kingdom
[05:19] against it and so to this day you will
[05:22] still get the official line coming out
[05:25] of the FCA which is that Bitcoin is it's
[05:28] it's a nothing it's uh an electronic
[05:31] Beanie Baby a speculative asset that has
[05:34] no use case no intrinsic value and a lot
[05:38] of this a lot of the the narratives from
[05:40] 2015 or 2017 are parented and
[05:43] regurgitated so for example we hear time
[05:45] and time again from the regulator
[05:46] Bitcoin has no use case and it's a
[05:50] little frustrating for people like
[05:51] myself who work in advocacy on on
[05:54] bitcoin because you can demonstrate well
[05:57] yes it does have a use case and then
[05:58] here and you know you can list out some
[06:00] use cases and show video evidence of of
[06:03] use
[06:04] cases and then they will turn around and
[06:08] say but Bitcoin has no use case I I
[06:10] don't know whether you find the same
[06:12] thing but it's it's it's it's very it's
[06:14] a very strange habit of mind I find uh I
[06:17] don't you must have encountered the same
[06:18] kind of thing
[06:20] yourself yeah it's always uh I think
[06:22] especially in the in the Western
[06:24] countries like UK the European Union
[06:27] United States we we kind of have to
[06:29] problem of the financial system for the
[06:32] normal person seems to be working fine
[06:35] like they they they don't get the
[06:37] problem really they they think yeah like
[06:40] the the dollars come to to the person if
[06:42] I transferred it's fine most are not uh
[06:47] most don't have the problem of being
[06:49] unbanked like in Austria we have like
[06:52] 99.9% of uh banking rate uh almost
[06:56] everyone that is in the age of having a
[06:59] bank account has a bank account and even
[07:01] like uh young kids can get like a a kids
[07:04] account and stuff like that so if you go
[07:07] to Africa if you go to El Salvador if
[07:11] you go to other places um there you
[07:13] don't have to or Venezuela Brazilian uh
[07:16] Argentina like there's so many places
[07:19] like that um where you don't have to
[07:21] explain so much about the use case of
[07:23] Bitcoin because here in the Western
[07:26] countries I feel like it's perceived as
[07:28] something yeah if you have so much money
[07:31] yeah you can also buy some Bitcoin it's
[07:32] for rich people I heard that a lot um I
[07:36] Heard also like oh it's just like a
[07:38] speculative thing and it all kind of
[07:41] stems from that they don't get the use
[07:43] case because they don't even realize how
[07:46] broken the monetary system is how that
[07:49] inflation rate that we now have is just
[07:51] the beginning of it and I think that's
[07:53] that that that's one reason why they
[07:57] don't get the solution because if you
[07:58] don't feel the pain if you don't feel
[08:00] the problem uh you're not as open to
[08:03] listen to a solution and people usually
[08:06] run towards a solution once they really
[08:08] feel pain but then it's too late like
[08:11] that's that's that's a pain Point uh you
[08:14] want to do that before then that's why I
[08:16] think it's always really important to
[08:18] educate your loved ones so uh at least
[08:21] you can in in your neighborhood with
[08:23] your loved ones with your family uh kind
[08:25] of get to a little bit of a better
[08:27] better State and and prepare for what's
[08:30] maybe to come like we don't know like
[08:32] maybe there's like a suddenly phase
[08:33] where the the monetary system really
[08:36] breaks down in a major way uh like it
[08:38] has done in Argentina multiple times in
[08:41] Venezuela has multiple times in Europe
[08:44] in the UK America even I mean America is
[08:46] probably the last resort um it can
[08:49] happen like that's not out of the
[08:50] question and I think that's kind of the
[08:53] the problem that I see in in
[08:56] educating uh Norm is if you if you like
[08:58] to say like that I think you make an
[09:00] excellent point there in relation to
[09:02] what problems does it appear to
[09:05] solve and as you've rightly said you
[09:09] know if you if the majority of your
[09:10] population is banked already and if they
[09:13] if they have very low payment frictions
[09:15] which they do in most Western countries
[09:17] and in fact as we see in most of Western
[09:20] Europe in the United Kingdom our pay
[09:22] tech is actually superior to the United
[09:25] States um your everyone will Tap and Pay
[09:28] Google pay and Apple pay are ubiquitous
[09:31] um we've been using chip and pin or tap
[09:33] to pay for a very long time here whereas
[09:35] in the United States you often will
[09:37] still see people swiping a credit card
[09:39] and then signing um so the the the
[09:42] paytech functionality of Bitcoin is less
[09:44] obvious for Regulators to understand
[09:46] here and I think the second part of your
[09:50] point is that that that really hits the
[09:53] nail on the head there because the
[09:55] problems that we are pointing out which
[09:57] Bitcoin solves the hard cap the
[10:00] incapability of changing the monetary
[10:03] policy of the protocol those are quite
[10:06] subtle points and they're not obvious to
[10:08] your your regular person in the street
[10:10] you know most of my friends don't work
[10:12] in fintech they don't work in finance
[10:14] they don't work in
[10:16] Bitcoin and the interesting thing I
[10:19] always find around the 2% inflation
[10:21] Target for most of the western central
[10:23] banks is that is just high enough for it
[10:26] to be helpful to the government but it's
[10:28] not quite High enough for people to be
[10:30] rioting in the streets and the central
[10:33] banks actually have to perform this
[10:34] delicate dance because if if they push
[10:36] inflation up to a consistently high
[10:38] level you get into quite obvious value
[10:42] destruction there you you must have you
[10:45] heard about the rule of
[10:46] 72 it's it's one of my favorite little
[10:49] tricks um my I think it's to to to
[10:54] calculate how much it devalues or
[10:56] something like that I I heard about it
[10:58] but I'm not familiar
[11:00] yeah it's it's a a neat little mental
[11:02] trick uh if if you take the uh divide 72
[11:07] by the rate of inflation and that shows
[11:09] you how quickly you'll lose half of your
[11:11] purchasing power uh so um and in the
[11:14] number of years so very rough numbers if
[11:17] if like in the UK we hit we hit 11%
[11:20] inflation at one point uh and at that
[11:24] rate you'll lose half your purchasing
[11:26] power in about seven years and obviously
[11:29] that that problem snowballs and
[11:30] exacerbates in Turkey for example their
[11:33] their inflation rate
[11:35] H sorry carry on I'm so super sorry I
[11:38] think the internet connection is kind of
[11:40] lagging sometimes
[11:43] now we we we speed into each other then
[11:47] I no no worries um uh what you what did
[11:49] you want us to say with with turkey just
[11:51] that their their inflation rate hit
[11:53] about 70% which means that in one year
[11:56] you lose half of your purchasing power
[12:00] and then it becomes very very obvious
[12:03] that you don't want to keep your savings
[12:06] your you know what what's your you know
[12:08] your your your energy and your time you
[12:10] don't want to keep that in your local
[12:12] currency anymore and once You' reach
[12:15] that decision then you begin to look at
[12:16] Alternatives and obviously we know one
[12:19] of the Fairly obvious Alternatives which
[12:21] is why we're on this podcast together
[12:23] absolutely and it's interesting how how
[12:26] people don't get that simple thing but
[12:29] what what do you think is the uh that's
[12:31] what I wanted to try to get in before
[12:33] what do you think is the inflation rate
[12:35] that people actually wake up because we
[12:38] even have as you said in Turkey a high
[12:40] inflation rate we have in other places
[12:42] High inflation rate and even there the
[12:44] Bitcoin adoption is not like 50% or 100%
[12:47] it's like way higher than we have in the
[12:50] Western countries I think Nigeria is is
[12:53] is one of the counries that is leading
[12:54] in the in in Bitcoin adoption depending
[12:57] on what metrics you're looking at but
[13:00] what has to happen like how high has the
[13:02] pain to rise how high has inflation has
[13:05] to be maybe also like what long of a
[13:09] period of time uh does that uh need to
[13:12] be that people actually wake up and say
[13:14] like oh like okay Euros is is gone US
[13:17] dollar pounds that is all for nothing I
[13:20] I really need to find an alternative and
[13:23] uh will they automatically come to
[13:26] bitcoin then or will they have like
[13:28] stocks and ETFs and and all the fancy
[13:31] things maybe even gold yeah so I i'
[13:33] break that into two questions really so
[13:36] what is the what's the trigger for
[13:38] people looking at Bitcoin and would they
[13:40] keep other investments in mind uh as
[13:44] well uh and I think the answer to the
[13:46] second question is almost certainly yes
[13:49] uh the key takeaway if your local
[13:52] currency is losing value is that you
[13:55] want to escape from it and we are sub
[13:59] we're seeing people subconsciously do
[14:00] that Across the Western World at the
[14:02] moment uh housing is a great example and
[14:06] this arguably has been happening for 20
[14:08] to 30 years uh Australia's housing
[14:11] market is one of the most unaffordable
[14:14] in the world um in the house prices in
[14:16] Sydney if if you look at those are
[14:19] almost beyond the reach of normal people
[14:21] at the moment and the same largely goes
[14:24] for the United Kingdom house prices here
[14:27] are extraordinarily High both in terms
[14:29] of actual pounds and in terms of
[14:32] multiplier of average
[14:35] salary uh and frankly I don't know how
[14:38] people in the generation under me are
[14:40] going to be able to afford to buy houses
[14:42] at those astonishing prices and one of
[14:45] the reasons for the move into housing is
[14:47] because it's perceived as a hard asset
[14:51] um which will retain value and grow
[14:54] faster than the your local currency and
[14:57] faster than
[14:59] any rate of interest that would that
[15:01] your your money would acre if you left
[15:03] it in a savings account so you know uh
[15:07] and the English have have always done
[15:08] this um probably even for longer than 20
[15:11] to 30 years to be honest so and um you
[15:15] know I'm I'm not a gold hater I can see
[15:17] merits in I I can understand the logic
[15:20] for moving your money out of your local
[15:22] currency into gold at the same time we
[15:25] get I I I think we we sometimes forget
[15:27] if we spend a lot of time talking to
[15:29] bitcoin is how new and strange it is to
[15:31] a lot of people and frankly how many how
[15:35] long it took some of us to to understand
[15:37] it personally I spent two years reading
[15:40] about it um before I felt comfortable
[15:43] that it was a real thing and uh that it
[15:47] was Secure and this monetary policy
[15:50] couldn't be
[15:51] changed uh it takes a long time and I
[15:54] I'd be interested to I don't think I've
[15:56] ever heard your origin story I don't
[15:57] know don't know how long took you to get
[16:00] across the line me a long time yeah it
[16:03] took it took me uh three years from
[16:06] first hearing about it first kind of
[16:08] getting interested in it uh to get over
[16:11] the fact that Bitcoin is not a scam so I
[16:14] it really took me a long time to uh get
[16:17] out like I was in a stock mindset I was
[16:19] like really deep in this like okay
[16:21] Bitcoin um needs to have a cash flow
[16:24] when I invest in something I want to
[16:26] have a multiple on top of that I was I
[16:28] wasn't at one Buffet kind of a mindset
[16:31] and it treated me good like from uh when
[16:33] I started investing till I got Bitcoin I
[16:36] I made really good Investments with with
[16:38] really great tech stocks but uh because
[16:43] I made good Returns on the stock market
[16:46] with picking individual stocks and it
[16:48] was also fun for me uh and uh it it kind
[16:52] of s my problem of inflation I even saw
[16:54] inflation as good for me because my
[16:56] assets were Rising I don't I didn't get
[16:59] the problem or even like the problem was
[17:01] even like a feature for me I was like Ah
[17:03] that's nice actually uh it it gives me
[17:05] more purchasing power uh so in in that
[17:08] way I really needed a long time three
[17:11] years to really get Bitcoin and then
[17:13] there was just like one weekend and I
[17:16] told that story sometimes on the podcast
[17:17] but there was one weekend where a guy um
[17:21] and where I worked back then asked me oh
[17:24] you're doing a lot with stocks but what
[17:26] about Bitcoin and I talked with him and
[17:29] he was not even in Bitcoin like he he
[17:30] was not a bitcoiner uh but he was
[17:32] interested in it and he asked me
[17:35] questions and questions about Bitcoin
[17:36] and where I kind of discovered um that I
[17:40] don't know a lot about Bitcoin because
[17:41] he was kind of looking at investing in
[17:44] it and I was kind of like oh don't do it
[17:46] so I wanted to prove him wrong and
[17:49] telling him why he should not invest in
[17:52] Bitcoin and I was like okay if I want to
[17:56] invest if I want to take a big stand on
[17:59] bitcoin I have to do the same research
[18:01] that I do with stock and I did a like
[18:03] before I invest in any stocks uh I did
[18:06] like 30 50 60 hours just investing the
[18:09] fundamentals of of that stock H and then
[18:12] on top of that the financials of it so
[18:15] like before I even looked at uh the
[18:18] financial statements of a stock I looked
[18:19] at like what are they doing what what
[18:22] the what use case how can that go over
[18:24] the next 10 years and the same kind of
[18:26] principal thinking I I tried to get the
[18:28] Bitcoin
[18:29] and uh it it I started that research on
[18:33] Friday on then Sunday evening uh I kind
[18:35] of came out of the even of that weekend
[18:38] and I was like ah may maybe Bitcoin is
[18:40] something like maybe there's something
[18:42] behind that and actually on Monday uh
[18:44] right after that I opened the coinbase
[18:46] account and Tuesday I ordered my ledger
[18:50] uh both I don't use anymore but back
[18:52] then I used it uh and uh so yeah I'm I'm
[18:55] self custody by the way from day one I'm
[18:58] really uh proud proud to say that H but
[19:01] also it was it took me that one week and
[19:04] that like okay I really actually have to
[19:06] look it up and I think that's it's it's
[19:08] not like that you need two years of
[19:10] research if you have really an open mind
[19:13] I think and you really want to dive deep
[19:15] and you can do it in a weekend or like a
[19:17] week depending on your previous
[19:19] knowledge uh but then it took me over a
[19:22] year to gain trust in it so like I I
[19:26] only invested like 1% of my stock
[19:28] portfolio in Bitcoin just to get some um
[19:31] exposure and then it took me a year to
[19:34] dump everything else I it I slowly grew
[19:37] like 5% 10% 50% and after a year I had
[19:41] everything in Bitcoin I sold all my
[19:43] other stocks uh so that's kind of my
[19:46] origin story from the first time I heard
[19:47] it till all in it was four years uh so
[19:50] it took me quite a long while uh but I'm
[19:53] still happy because when I look now back
[19:55] I came into Bitcoin in 2020 price was
[19:58] around around I don't know 7,000 6,000
[20:01] when I first bought some obviously
[20:03] didn't buy a lot but because I was like
[20:06] 20 years old had almost no money uh and
[20:10] uh was not convinced of it uh but yeah
[20:12] then uh slowly slowly grew and uh slowly
[20:15] slowly I got into that but yeah it's I
[20:18] think it needs that moment of you need a
[20:21] really good reason to investigate and
[20:23] for me it was just to prove him wrong
[20:25] and funny enough he still not is not in
[20:28] Bitcoin but I am which is really funny
[20:30] that the guy that brought me into
[20:31] Bitcoin never bought it and I
[20:34] was I I didn't see him for free years
[20:37] but I I think I think I have to text him
[20:39] as soon I to tell
[20:41] him send send him a copy of this show
[20:44] that's really funny I I haven't heard
[20:46] your origin story before thank you uh
[20:49] but that that's you've said a lot of
[20:50] interesting stuff there that's that's
[20:52] it's cool to hear how thorough you were
[20:54] in researching it and I have a lot of
[20:57] sympathy with that I would do the same
[21:00] when I invested in uh you know my
[21:02] pension stocks or in my my tax efficient
[21:05] stocks I would read the prospectus I
[21:08] would read the offering document I would
[21:10] read the financial times about and you
[21:12] know what the company that I was
[21:13] investing in was doing and so on and
[21:15] that's what a sensible investor does and
[21:19] I think the the interesting thing that
[21:21] we're dealing with in this trying to
[21:23] straddle the traditional Financial World
[21:25] which includes the FCA as the regulator
[21:28] here and the Bitcoin world is that a lot
[21:32] of a lot of the people who are making
[21:34] decisions are of a similar age to me so
[21:35] you know I'm in my I'm in my mid- 4S the
[21:38] decision makers at uh a hedge fund or
[21:41] some will be a similar age maybe
[21:43] slightly older move moving from my age
[21:45] into the know the generation senior to
[21:47] me and all of those people have grown up
[21:51] in a world where everything digital can
[21:53] be copied at no cost so that that's
[21:56] their that's their base case they've
[21:58] they've all grown up in a world much
[22:00] like so I I slightly predate the
[22:02] internet I can remember A World Before
[22:04] the internet and a world after the
[22:06] internet but everything that digital
[22:08] that I've ever used has been as easy as
[22:11] rightclick and save down so whenever you
[22:16] send an email there's always a copy not
[22:18] only in your outbox and your sent items
[22:20] but also on servers all over the place
[22:23] so their basic mental model that
[22:25] everyone of my age and older has is that
[22:28] everything digital can be copied you
[22:29] know we grew up in the age of Napster
[22:31] and lime wire and Kazar uh you know
[22:34] everything digital was essentially free
[22:37] and so when you're trying to explain to
[22:40] someone with that mental model that
[22:41] Bitcoin is not like anything else
[22:43] digital they have ever seen that's quite
[22:46] a Quantum Leap for them to understand so
[22:49] I think it's important to understand the
[22:51] the the base case that they have in
[22:52] their mind which is that everything
[22:54] digital can be copied for
[22:56] free and then the interesting next step
[22:59] to take in in describing to them and it
[23:02] was I noted down something you said
[23:03] around you wanting a stock to have a a
[23:06] cash flow for example that's a
[23:08] fascinating point on on bitcoin because
[23:10] obviously one of the big criticisms of
[23:11] it is it's not cash generative and if
[23:14] you're used to valuing a company on an
[23:16] eaar multiple or looking at a you know
[23:20] hedge fund on an assets under management
[23:23] multiple then again Bitcoin doesn't fit
[23:25] your mental model why why does it have
[23:27] value
[23:29] and so it's actually quite an
[23:30] interesting conversation to have with a
[23:32] with an investor or with a regulator who
[23:34] has an open mind they say okay well yeah
[23:36] those things are true Bitcoin doesn't
[23:38] generate cash flows and it you can't
[23:41] value it on an eadar multiple
[23:44] basis so and also but then exploring the
[23:47] ideas around why it has value and one of
[23:50] the key ones there is that it is a it is
[23:52] a digital commodity that cannot be
[23:54] copied the code can be copied but
[23:57] Bitcoin itself a Bitcoin cannot cannot
[24:00] be sent twice we we you and I know that
[24:02] easily but most of the people outside
[24:04] our our sphere won't understand that and
[24:07] then obviously you go into why C it be
[24:09] copied is the and I I tend not to dive
[24:14] deep into proof of work immediately
[24:15] although proof of work is is is the
[24:18] answer but talking instead around how
[24:21] The Ledger is maintained and that that's
[24:24] an easier concept I think think for for
[24:26] these these people to get so obviously
[24:29] the as we you and I know uh The
[24:32] bitcoin's distribu Ledger is kept on
[24:34] each of the nodes that are globally
[24:37] distributed and are running
[24:40] continuously and it it's relatively easy
[24:43] for someone in the traditional Finance
[24:46] world to understand how that ledger is
[24:49] updated so obviously in the case of a
[24:51] normal distributed Ledger in the ca like
[24:54] in the case of you know I don't know a
[24:56] record of jpegs on on on Microsoft Excel
[25:00] you can uh you can control C control V
[25:04] you can copy across you can immediately
[25:06] copy the entire file explaining to them
[25:10] that the process of adding new
[25:12] transactions to bitcoin's Ledger is
[25:14] enormously
[25:15] expensive and imposes a gigantic cost on
[25:19] anyone a minor who wants to add a new
[25:22] transaction to that ledger and that cost
[25:25] is expressed both in terms of hardware
[25:27] and in terms of
[25:28] electricity and it's incapable of being
[25:31] forged once you get that light bulb
[25:34] moment across that is an absolute key
[25:38] fun it's a fundamental part for me in
[25:40] bitcoin's value
[25:41] proposition so you're dealing with
[25:43] something digital which has all the
[25:44] advantages of something digital you and
[25:46] I could send it to each other right now
[25:49] we can transport value around the globe
[25:53] effectively for free but that value
[25:57] cannot be fored or artificially
[26:00] replicated then I think you've got a you
[26:02] got a bit of a wedge there in trying to
[26:04] understand well oh well maybe this thing
[26:06] does have value and then your value
[26:09] question is how so what value would I
[26:11] put on a non- government issued hard
[26:16] capped monetary asset whose monetary
[26:20] policy cannot be
[26:21] changed that cannot easily be replicated
[26:25] that cannot be forged and which can
[26:27] enable me to send value around the world
[26:30] in a in a completely secure way then
[26:33] your value your value proposition
[26:35] questions become very different in fact
[26:37] completely different from how you would
[26:38] value a company in the way that you
[26:39] described earlier absolutely it's
[26:43] interesting um to to make that argument
[26:46] because that's that's one of the hard
[26:48] question that I still can drop my head
[26:50] around because bitcoin's potential is so
[26:52] big it's like how how do
[26:55] you if you do it also with stocks you
[26:58] probably are aware of that you always
[27:00] try to figure out what's the Tam What's
[27:02] the total addressable Market of a stock
[27:05] what what can it maximum reach uh and
[27:08] the best stocks are those who actually
[27:10] expand their own a total addressable
[27:12] market now with Bitcoin you can make the
[27:15] argument okay it's gold it's digital
[27:18] gold so at least 10x from here that's
[27:20] the total addressable Market but it's
[27:22] not only gold it's also a currency you
[27:24] can use it uh as as the pound as the
[27:27] dollar as as everything like that but
[27:29] then not only that um what what are ETFs
[27:33] trying to do ETFs are doing the same
[27:36] thing they they're just like saving
[27:37] Financial energy so you then also
[27:40] calculate the deps in there on savings
[27:42] account in there and it's kind of hard
[27:44] to to wrap the head around where is the
[27:47] limit to bitcoin like what is the total
[27:50] addressable Market of of Bitcoin how how
[27:52] do you how do you approach that it's
[27:54] interesting you you mentioned gold that
[27:57] was like a lot of people where where I
[28:00] started and um back in
[28:03] 2015 from I've been reading about it for
[28:05] a couple of years and in 2015 I think
[28:10] the uh total market cap of
[28:12] gold uh if Bitcoin had hit the
[28:15] equivalence market cap in uh in 2015 it
[28:19] would have put each coin at about 330k
[28:23] us so that was roughly where I where I
[28:26] figured the the total addressable Market
[28:29] was in 2015 and back then Bitcoin was
[28:33] trading at about $250 from memory um so
[28:37] there's obviously a bit of an asymmetric
[28:38] opportunity there um if you go on that
[28:41] back of an envelope
[28:43] calculation and I still think that's
[28:45] probably the most plausible Target for
[28:48] for Bitcoin um from memory it's now in
[28:51] the top
[28:52] 10 uh all of all asset classes globally
[28:56] uh I can't remember the exact ranking
[28:58] and obviously there's been a bit of
[29:00] price fluctuation uh in the last few
[29:03] weeks gold I think is still the most
[29:05] realistic but I think you're asking some
[29:08] more interesting questions when you
[29:10] begin to wonder will Bitcoin begin to
[29:13] demonetize housing for example we've
[29:15] already mentioned earlier that certainly
[29:17] in the UK and in many of the Western
[29:19] countries housing tends to be somewhere
[29:23] where oh there we are so we're number
[29:25] eight our top and oh when did we ever
[29:27] take silver I just
[29:30] realiz excellent yeah it it happened
[29:33] it's actually quite quite uh a good
[29:36] amount of distance also we're really
[29:38] close to Saudi Saudi aramu also so like
[29:42] that that that happened I think even
[29:44] like a few weeks ago uh and yeah we we
[29:47] we are rising in the ranks uh Saudi
[29:50] arano is not that far uh Google is far
[29:54] Amazon is far Nvidia microsof Apple but
[29:57] I I will say as long as Bitcoin is still
[30:01] uh not the not bigger than any single uh
[30:06] company we are super early oh yeah and
[30:09] it will be at no time where Bitcoin is
[30:12] uh bigger than the 10 biggest companies
[30:14] combined so like uh we have a long way
[30:17] to go I just wanted to to give you the
[30:19] context from from what you mentioned
[30:21] yeah definitely well just looking at
[30:24] that chart it's roughly a 3X to to over
[30:29] to be the second largest in the world um
[30:32] less less than you know 1.8 to overtake
[30:35] Apple at 3.7 trillion and it's less than
[30:39] a 10x to hit gold and certainly in in
[30:43] inv Venture Capital terms if you were to
[30:46] invest money into what what what would
[30:48] become a successful new Venture Venture
[30:51] Capital company uh let's say a tech
[30:54] company uh a 10x is is far from of from
[30:58] rare and that's exactly the kind of
[31:00] thing that you would look at it's
[31:01] exactly the kind of opportunity that
[31:03] Peter teal for example would have looked
[31:05] at um when he was first investing uh in
[31:08] Facebook back in the very early days um
[31:12] so I don't think it's unrealistic at all
[31:14] to think that Bitcoin could 10x from
[31:16] here the only thing I don't know is the
[31:18] time scale that that would take and that
[31:20] ties back into the wider understanding
[31:22] of what it is and what it does and and
[31:24] that itself ties back to what we were
[31:27] talking about earli on in the call when
[31:29] we were mentioning what what problem it
[31:31] solves so and I thought it was
[31:34] interesting you mentioned um unbanked
[31:37] and paytech functions first uh if you
[31:40] are in a country that has very poor
[31:43] paytech capabilities then Bitcoin using
[31:47] a lightning wallet is is a fantastic
[31:49] option uh and as you know there are
[31:51] there are many other option options such
[31:53] as the the various ecash solutions that
[31:55] are being built at the moment um or
[31:59] matura uh developed by a fantastic South
[32:02] African developer which lets you send
[32:04] Bitcoin um even when you don't have uh
[32:07] data availability you can send it using
[32:10] SMS now those are fantastic solutions
[32:13] that wouldn't have been built in in
[32:15] Europe because we don't face the same
[32:17] kind of paytech frictions the less
[32:20] obvious points around value distruction
[32:22] of currency and I think this really
[32:25] zeros into the value proposition here um
[32:29] Lawrence lean for example uh calls uh
[32:32] Bitcoin a hedge against sovereign debt
[32:36] default which I don't think is an is an
[32:39] unrealistic risk given how heavily
[32:41] indebted so many countries are and more
[32:44] importantly what their their Debt
[32:46] Service burden looks
[32:47] like the I I'm most well informed on the
[32:52] the UK numbers obviously but the latest
[32:55] figures from uh from our offic of
[32:58] national statistics show that um
[33:00] currently the UK spends more money
[33:03] servicing its national debt than it
[33:05] spends on either education or defense
[33:08] which is quite shocking and we are at an
[33:10] interesting point in Sovereign in the
[33:13] sovereign debt markets where and I think
[33:15] this is this is really black Rock's
[33:17] investment thesis behind ibit they seem
[33:20] to be the cly the messaging that we're
[33:22] getting from people like Larry think
[33:24] seems to be perhaps you might want to
[33:27] consider a Wonder 2% allocation of your
[33:30] money into something that can't be
[33:33] inflated by governments in order to deal
[33:35] with their sovereign debt issues frankly
[33:38] I don't know if that Accords with your
[33:40] kind of analysis or thinking on that on
[33:42] that basis interested to hear I
[33:44] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[33:47] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[33:50] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[33:53] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[33:56] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[33:59] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[34:02] go out there and show that you are a
[34:04] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[34:07] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[34:10] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:13] Genesis edition of their watch
[34:16] collections you have the date of the
[34:18] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[34:21] and of course also the block height and
[34:24] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[34:28] level of detail they put in in this
[34:30] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[34:32] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:36] down in the descriptions I love those
[34:38] watches so so much if you watch or
[34:41] listen to my podcast on a regular bases
[34:44] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[34:46] and now the most important step is to
[34:49] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[34:52] hardware wallet my personal
[34:54] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[34:56] the bitbox it's super C it's simple to
[34:58] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[35:00] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[35:03] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[35:07] with the code Robin at the checkout
[35:09] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[35:13] your bitbox and the next step is to
[35:15] really level up your sovereignty as an
[35:18] individual you have to have the most
[35:20] secure self custody setup you have to
[35:23] secure your own devices you have to
[35:26] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:29] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:31] where you live you even want to have a
[35:33] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:36] in case something goes really really
[35:38] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:40] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:43] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:46] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[35:49] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[35:52] how you can level up your sovereignty
[35:56] yeah it's interesting uh I think that I
[35:59] I usually so like I usually try to be
[36:02] really cautious when orange ping someone
[36:04] and speaking to new people that didn't
[36:07] have any in uh inputs on bitcoin and I
[36:10] usually use 5% as a target of like okay
[36:14] like it if how I frame it usually is um
[36:20] here is what I see Bitcoin is going and
[36:23] I explained that my vision for Bitcoin
[36:25] and how it's overt taking the whole
[36:27] financial system uh and then I asked
[36:30] them okay How likely do you think that
[36:33] is and they usually go ahead and like oh
[36:36] it could happen like 10% 15% or
[36:38] something like that and I'm like okay if
[36:40] if you think that with 50% uh likelihood
[36:44] it it can actually happen wouldn't it be
[36:47] a good and wise decision to to put at
[36:49] least like one to 5% of your liquid net
[36:52] worth uh in into Bitcoin like if if if
[36:56] there is a non zero chance of that
[36:59] happening uh you would benefit massively
[37:03] even if you have a very small allocation
[37:05] on the downside you don't lose a lot if
[37:08] if that actually goes to zero and it's
[37:10] it's it's it's a nothing Burger uh so
[37:13] and with every year that argument gets
[37:16] gets better and better because like 10
[37:19] years ago that was like ah okay I just
[37:22] put like I just invest like hundred EUR
[37:24] or a thousand Euros in Bitcoin because
[37:26] it's so risky but now we have publicly
[37:29] traded companies in Bitcoin we have
[37:31] nation states in Bitcoin we have the
[37:33] president of the United States being on
[37:35] bitcoin conferences and talking about
[37:37] Bitcoin even though I don't like how he
[37:39] talks about it but that's another
[37:41] discussion uh and and we have all those
[37:44] amazing things in Bitcoin um where it
[37:48] gets harder and harder also black rock
[37:50] is a big thing especially for uh
[37:52] traditional Financial people um we have
[37:55] more and more things of like prove that
[37:58] this thing actually can work out so that
[38:02] 5% maybe even better 10% like uh the the
[38:05] likelihood of Bitcoin succeeding over
[38:07] the long run and actually pulling that
[38:09] off which I think 100% happens that's
[38:12] why 100% of my net worth is in Bitcoin
[38:15] but if you knew the Bitcoin I would say
[38:18] don't jump in with all your wealth like
[38:20] I I would never recommend to anyone that
[38:23] is just starting out with Bitcoin
[38:25] investing everything right now in
[38:27] Bitcoin that seems to be a stupid idea
[38:29] because you probably uh are not uh
[38:32] educated enough to be convinced enough
[38:35] of Bitcoin to withstand the massive
[38:39] volatility and the likelihood of you
[38:41] being shaken out with a minus 50% crash
[38:45] and then losing out on the 300% uh
[38:49] uprise afterwards it's like really high
[38:52] so like get get yet if if you want to
[38:56] jump in a really cold l
[38:58] you check first if there's a stone you
[39:00] check first how cold the water actually
[39:02] is you you should check out that Lake
[39:04] before you jump in uh so uh that that's
[39:07] what I usually try to to get across and
[39:11] by the way I just because you mentioned
[39:12] Larry and and I think Larry is a is is a
[39:15] really great guy and I had him recently
[39:17] and actually on the podcast just make a
[39:21] uh a small tip for people I it's on
[39:25] under my sixth uh most couple of videos
[39:28] you can easily search it it's a it's a
[39:30] really great um podcast episode one of
[39:33] the really educative on on how the feeld
[39:37] system will likely go forward in the
[39:40] next like five 10 years uh and by the
[39:43] way I also heard that he's preparing a
[39:45] book uh I'm really looking forward to
[39:47] that because that could hit the the
[39:49] mainstream really hard but I have not uh
[39:52] read it till now he just told me in Abu
[39:54] Dhabi about it uh will will be fun but
[39:56] yeah sorry for that small tension I
[39:59] think it's really important that we um
[40:02] uh that we are careful with our with our
[40:06] orange uh pill so to speak and black
[40:09] rock Trump and all those things are
[40:12] really good for us in in our
[40:14] explanations and they I'm really looking
[40:16] forward also to the Christmas tables I I
[40:19] meet a lot of um uh family members that
[40:23] I haven't met for a long time uh will be
[40:25] fun to talk about that because was last
[40:27] time I talked with them Bitcoin was like
[40:29] at 30 40K so it's 3x
[40:33] now well I I'd actually recommend that
[40:37] people listen to that talk with Larry as
[40:39] well that's probably what I was thinking
[40:41] about and I I think his book is just
[40:43] finished I I believe he announced that
[40:44] today um so it's always interesting to
[40:48] hear people like Larry who've got such
[40:51] um deep understanding of financial
[40:54] markets and and of sovereign debt
[40:56] because I I think people like him have
[40:58] perceived an issue slightly ahead of
[41:00] where the mainstream is going to
[41:02] perceive it um we've mentioned issues
[41:05] around sovereign debt and the difficulty
[41:08] that Sovereign nations are going to have
[41:10] with repaying their currency the the
[41:12] obvious point to make here is while I'm
[41:14] not an mmt guy I do agree with some mmt
[41:18] Theory which is that a government which
[41:20] prints its own money can't ever
[41:21] realistically go bankrupt so when you
[41:23] hear people saying are the the us is
[41:25] going to go bankrupt or the UK will go
[41:27] bankrupt that's not technically going to
[41:30] happen if your debts are denominated in
[41:32] a currency that you can create you can
[41:34] go and creating that currency
[41:36] forever the consequence of that though
[41:38] is obvious to both of us and probably
[41:40] obvious to everyone who listens to your
[41:42] podcast it's that the purchasing power
[41:44] of each unit of your currency decreases
[41:47] the more you print so it's if you're
[41:50] dealing with your sovereign debt in that
[41:51] way what you're doing is essentially a
[41:53] soft
[41:54] default no one ever as you know no one
[41:56] ever wants to do a hard default if you
[41:59] if you go for a hard default you lose
[42:01] all credibility on uh on the money
[42:04] markets and it's very very challenging
[42:06] for you ever again to raise money on the
[42:09] international bond markets we have
[42:10] examples of that previously Argentina
[42:13] has defaulted in the past Russia has
[42:15] defaulted Greece came very very close to
[42:17] defaulting during the financial crisis
[42:19] and each of those countries have
[42:21] struggled subsequently to raise money on
[42:23] the international
[42:24] markets and obviously that it's crucial
[42:27] for countries to be able to do that
[42:29] because of deficit spending um the that
[42:33] a country's deficit is is ordinarily
[42:35] understood as the difference between
[42:37] what the government can raise in taxes
[42:40] and what it needs to spend in a year and
[42:42] countries typically make up that short
[42:44] form via VIA selling bonds
[42:48] basically um so the I wanted to I I
[42:52] scoble down something you were as you
[42:54] were talking earlier the
[42:57] around around your allocation to bitcoin
[43:00] so I think we're we're on the cusp of
[43:01] seeing an interesting change which
[43:03] affects both The Regulators that we were
[43:04] talking about at the beginning and also
[43:06] some of the money market investors that
[43:08] we've talked about subsequently and
[43:10] that's around career risk so the career
[43:13] risk for the FCA or for a regulator in
[43:17] terms of telling the market that Bitcoin
[43:19] is a safe
[43:20] investment uh is obviously still
[43:23] apparent it's a volatile asset the
[43:26] volatility may be the price of being
[43:27] early and you know you and I probably
[43:30] have a different opinion around that
[43:32] from some of the FCA but the the key
[43:34] thing for the FCA person will be one of
[43:37] caution their career risk is such that
[43:39] if they come out and tell the market
[43:41] that Bitcoin is fine and then there's a
[43:43] 50% draw down lots of individual people
[43:45] will lose money and they absolutely want
[43:48] to avoid that um and the same was true
[43:52] for most money markets and and money
[43:54] managers until very recently so you
[43:57] would go to an investment committee and
[43:59] say oh I think we should have a 2%
[44:01] exposure to bitcoin that would you'd be
[44:03] laughed out of the
[44:05] room but the conversations that we've
[44:07] been having in the last year certainly
[44:08] since January when the ETFs launched the
[44:11] question is is switching slightly away
[44:14] from an instant refusal to consider
[44:17] Bitcoin and more of an more of a
[44:19] question should we consider an
[44:21] allocation to bitcoin so career risk
[44:24] certainly for investors has diminished I
[44:26] don't think it's yet diminished for
[44:28] Regulators because they are obviously
[44:31] going to be more cautious and more keen
[44:33] to protect um Regular retail investors
[44:36] like you and I um but I think it's
[44:38] interesting that certainly in in
[44:40] investment committees we're beginning to
[44:41] see the question why AR why don't I have
[44:43] a 2% exposure to bitcoin and if you
[44:47] don't mind me going on a bit of a Spiel
[44:49] here um you may have heard the story
[44:51] recently around the UK pension fund um
[44:54] that uh has famously invested in in
[44:57] Bitcoin it's got some exposure in a fund
[45:00] um now their exposure was a mere 2% so
[45:03] it was below the the number you were
[45:05] talking about earlier and uh according
[45:08] to publicly available information they
[45:11] received very very thorough advice as to
[45:14] the effect that a total loss of that 2%
[45:16] exposure would have on the aims and
[45:19] goals of the pension fund and the
[45:22] conclusion that they reached uh and this
[45:24] was supported by the model was that if
[45:27] there was a total catastrophic loss then
[45:30] it would delay the achievement of the
[45:31] Pension funds goals by a few months
[45:34] however if there was any upside at all
[45:37] then it would reduce the period in which
[45:39] they would achieve the their Pension
[45:41] funds goal by a couple of years
[45:44] so perfect that that's exactly the one I
[45:47] was thinking about um it's worth digging
[45:49] up some of you might want to get the
[45:50] cartright guys on your podcast actually
[45:53] they they've got some very interesting
[45:55] uh information around they're thinking
[45:57] which they can disclose
[45:59] publicly and interesting yeah
[46:02] interesting I I just want to put that
[46:04] also in uh that's that's from coindesk
[46:07] is obviously um a nice article about it
[46:10] or like rather nice article about it but
[46:13] if you just Google UK pension fund
[46:16] Bitcoin uh the first thing that that
[46:18] comes up is like a UK pension scheme has
[46:21] been branded deeply
[46:23] irresponsible after investing in Bitcoin
[46:27] deeply irresponsible that that's so
[46:30] funny how mainstream media like kind of
[46:32] perceives it like Financial advis is
[46:34] deeply irresponsible to include Bitcoin
[46:35] in pension uh it it's just it's just
[46:39] really fun to see that it's also good
[46:41] that like uh a neutral or a little bit
[46:44] of a positive article comes up I didn't
[46:46] read it till now but it seems to be like
[46:49] uh a good article uh but yeah I just I
[46:52] was I was laughing when I was seeing it
[46:54] and it was like Sky News t play
[46:56] responsible to include
[46:59] Bitcoin especially 3% like that's that's
[47:03] not uh but money yeah it's 50 million
[47:07] pounds $65 million that that that's a
[47:09] good amount of money to be honest that
[47:11] that's that's where I think the the
[47:12] power comes if if those big um Pension
[47:17] funds uh really come in and that's just
[47:19] like one uh and I don't know if it's in
[47:21] the UK like that in like in Austria but
[47:24] we are forced to invest in Pension funds
[47:26] we cannot
[47:27] um choose to not invest in Pension funds
[47:29] we have to invest in the Pension funds
[47:32] um and you can only choose which
[47:35] provider you you go with but they all at
[47:38] least for now uh they kind of offer the
[47:42] same thing I looked in all like you have
[47:44] uh if you're self-employed company as I
[47:46] started you have six months to decide
[47:48] and if you don't decide in the six
[47:50] months you get randomly designed this
[47:53] assigned one and uh this was like four
[47:56] or five provid ERS and I looked at all
[47:58] of them none of them had Bitcoin uh and
[48:01] all of them had kind of the same thing
[48:04] and I was looking at them like ah I I
[48:06] will not decide because H how how can I
[48:09] decide between four apples like it
[48:11] doesn't make sense but the career risk
[48:14] is also interesting and maybe you can
[48:16] talk about how this is in the UK with
[48:18] also with the with the uh UK is it
[48:22] actually in the UK before that is in the
[48:24] UK also like that that you cannot uh opt
[48:27] out of the pension fund do you have to
[48:29] invest in a government
[48:31] subsidized pension fund it's similar but
[48:35] not directly the same so there are new
[48:37] laws that came in a few years ago which
[48:39] now require all employers so all
[48:41] companies to uh to have a workplace
[48:44] pension for their employees um so it was
[48:47] perceived correctly that not enough
[48:49] people were saving for their retirement
[48:51] and so there was a big drive a few years
[48:53] ago to ensure that people had workplace
[48:55] pensions and typically those will go
[48:57] into one of a small number of providers
[49:00] so not dissimilar to what you were
[49:01] describing in
[49:02] Austria um just before we move on from
[49:04] that cart ride one though I I do take
[49:07] quite a lot of issue with those
[49:08] headlines the the idea that the fund was
[49:11] deeply irresponsible f i I think that's
[49:14] incorrect in a in terms of fact and also
[49:16] in terms of opinion so in terms of fact
[49:19] I do know from publicly available
[49:21] information that the fund spent over a
[49:23] year researching that decision they got
[49:26] professional advice uh the upsides and
[49:30] downsides were modeled and you have to
[49:33] remember that the these Pension funds
[49:35] have trustees and they take their
[49:37] fiduciary duties and responsibilities
[49:39] very seriously you know they are
[49:41] managing the money for people at a
[49:44] crucial part time of their lives when
[49:46] they're no longer able to earn money so
[49:48] a pension trustee will typically have be
[49:51] very very thoughtful around their
[49:52] fiduciary
[49:54] responsibilities and
[49:56] and rightly so um and I know that they
[49:59] spent a long time taking professional
[50:02] advice looking at the models and as
[50:04] we've talked about there seems to be a
[50:06] low downside and a high upside in other
[50:09] words an asymmetric return and they they
[50:12] expose themselves to that asymmetric
[50:15] return at an to my mind an appropriate
[50:17] percentage
[50:18] allocation
[50:21] so both in terms of fact and opinion I
[50:24] think they acted entirely responsibly
[50:26] you know
[50:27] you you and I we we both invest
[50:29] personally all Investments carry an
[50:32] element of risk and your job as uh a
[50:35] manager of money or an allocator of
[50:38] capital is to make as educated an
[50:42] assessment of that risk as you possibly
[50:44] can with the knowledge that you know all
[50:47] all risk carries carries with it um
[50:51] certain downsides I I don't think I
[50:54] don't think it's fair to say that they
[50:55] actually responsi at all I think I think
[50:56] it's you know if they if they'd had a 3%
[51:00] allocation to um you Scottish mortgages
[51:03] have you have you come across
[51:05] them so I I did in my former life I was
[51:09] a I was a s an
[51:11] m&a and Venture Capital lawyer and I did
[51:15] a lot of work for a fund called bayy
[51:17] gford and um one of their famous funds
[51:20] that they manage is is uh Scottish
[51:22] mortgages who have had a fantastic track
[51:25] record but one of of the um specialities
[51:28] behind Scottish mortgages was investing
[51:30] in very early stage tech companies so
[51:33] they invested in Spotify in Skyscanner
[51:36] in home 24 in
[51:39] hellofresh uh in rocket internet um
[51:42] which is
[51:43] um B Bas based out of Germany so all all
[51:46] manner of different you know very high
[51:48] growth tech companies and some of those
[51:51] performed fantastically well some some
[51:53] of them haven't but you know if if if
[51:56] you do if you if a pension fund were to
[51:58] buy a 5% allocation in Scottish
[52:00] mortgages to my mind that's arguably
[52:03] more risky than investing in in
[52:05] something like Bitcoin so I I don't
[52:07] think it's a fair categorization to say
[52:09] that they were
[52:10] Reckless H it's absolutely not fair um
[52:13] and it's um we kind of are in this
[52:17] moment in time where if we disagree with
[52:19] someone we kind of slander them we hate
[52:22] on them uh I see it online but I also
[52:25] see it in professional newspapers uh
[52:28] calling someone deeply irresponsible
[52:31] with the just the uh the thing that you
[52:33] just described you described it
[52:34] perfectly fine uh it it shows that
[52:39] they they either out for clicks or
[52:42] really like hating on him and it's
[52:44] probably a mix of both them both of them
[52:47] because it's definitely not deeply
[52:49] responsible did can disagree with the
[52:52] move uh they can say like oh like I
[52:54] wouldn't have done it uh but like
[52:57] calling someone deeply irresponsible is
[53:00] honestly a a very hard uh thing to say
[53:05] it means
[53:07] the if if we go to the definition of the
[53:10] of law there always like if you act in a
[53:13] responsible way or deeply responsible or
[53:16] a little bit irresponsible and then it
[53:18] depends on on what you did to act deeply
[53:20] irresponsible you just done it because
[53:23] someone told you like like oh like
[53:25] Bitcoin is a good thing okay let's throw
[53:26] in 3% if they if they didn't do any
[53:29] research if they just like all right
[53:31] let's let's do that no models all the
[53:33] things that you described then it would
[53:36] be considered irresponsible I don't know
[53:38] about deeply irresponsible uh but
[53:40] definitely it would be irresponsible to
[53:42] just throw in money in something that
[53:44] you didn't research that's always
[53:46] irresponsible no matter where you throw
[53:48] it in there uh but if you have done the
[53:50] research and you came to conclusion uh
[53:53] and many other people came to the
[53:54] conclusion like they're not alone like
[53:57] micro strategy a nation state Donald
[54:00] Trump like Eric Trump uh said uh in Abu
[54:04] Dhabi Bitcoin is going to a million
[54:07] like it's it's not a it's it's not a a
[54:12] new thing to say to like invest a little
[54:14] bit into Bitcoin uh not only not even
[54:17] from the disagreeing standpoint but yeah
[54:20] I I fully agree with you here and also
[54:23] one thing I want to touch on with you is
[54:26] that
[54:27] uh what you said with the career risk
[54:29] and people being silent about it I
[54:32] talked with Joanna kotar that till a
[54:36] week ago she was the only one that spoke
[54:39] out for Bitcoin in the German Parliament
[54:42] now the Finance Minister also joined the
[54:45] game yeah he joined it just recently uh
[54:49] and I I I I spoke with her and she said
[54:53] there are many more German Parliament
[54:55] members that really get Bitcoin and
[54:58] really like it but they're not speaking
[55:00] out because they are part of a party
[55:02] system and they're not allowed to
[55:04] because the party policy says no Bitcoin
[55:08] and they would risk their political
[55:11] career by being thrown out of the party
[55:14] if they are all of the sudden vocal
[55:16] about Bitcoin so you cannot do it
[55:19] without the party and I guess the same
[55:21] thing is true for across all Industries
[55:24] politics uh CF o uh UK Pension funds and
[55:29] all all all the things because you get a
[55:31] risk in there the the Financial Risk is
[55:34] not there with Bitcoin it's more the
[55:36] career risk do do I lose it and that's
[55:38] why we don't have an Apple or Google or
[55:40] an Amazon in in in uh in Bitcoin yet uh
[55:44] because the people that decide that
[55:47] might get fired if they do that if if
[55:49] they if they actually go forward because
[55:52] they like oh like it's what what are you
[55:54] doing like why why do we need Bitcoin so
[55:56] that career risk is still there and I
[55:59] wonder and maybe you have some opinion
[56:01] on that I wonder what does it take to
[56:04] flip that career risk because at some
[56:06] point I think the career risk will be oh
[56:08] you still don't get Bitcoin oh you or
[56:10] you still don't have a Bitcoin strategy
[56:12] oh oh sorry we need a new CFO oh you you
[56:16] as a politician think Bitcoin is uh bad
[56:20] like I'm not voting for you you
[56:22] obviously don't get it so like what what
[56:24] has to happen that we kind of flip that
[56:27] that career risk thing on its head of
[56:30] like it's all of the sudden a career
[56:31] risk to not be into Bitcoin I hate to
[56:34] say this but uh and and larly because I
[56:37] hate talking about the price of Bitcoin
[56:39] but I suspect that the the the price is
[56:42] the easiest way of communicating the
[56:45] potential up and downsides um so again
[56:49] you know using the Pension funds as an
[56:52] example uh you you said it was unfair to
[56:55] call them you know irresponsible or
[56:57] Reckless and I agree and if they had if
[57:00] the critics had categorized what the
[57:02] pension fund has done by saying you know
[57:05] their their their risk tolerance was
[57:07] clearly higher than mine that I think is
[57:09] a perfectly Fair statement you know if
[57:11] you've if you have assessed the the risk
[57:14] of what it is that you're going to be
[57:15] putting your money into and you decide
[57:17] that your risk tolerance is at a certain
[57:19] level other people's risk tolerance may
[57:21] be lower that's fine you know I would I
[57:24] would you know I'm a Bitcoin or you're
[57:26] bitcoiner if the pension fund had aped
[57:28] all of their pension fund into Bitcoin
[57:30] that ironically I would have said would
[57:32] be relatively irresponsible not least
[57:35] because Pension funds have got um
[57:38] payment obligations as well you know
[57:40] they're not just a fund that sits there
[57:42] they have to make payments out for the
[57:44] people who are already drawing their
[57:45] pensions down and and as such they need
[57:47] to have predictable in in predictable
[57:49] outflows so that they know exactly how
[57:52] much things are going to cost them you
[57:53] know within a c within certain
[57:55] parameters and they need to make sure
[57:56] that they never need to be a forced
[57:58] seller of the assets that they hold so
[58:00] if there's a certain and you know this
[58:02] is quite a simplistic analysis but if
[58:04] there's a sudden draw down in price they
[58:06] don't need they don't want to be a
[58:08] forced seller of Assets in order to meet
[58:10] their ongoing obligations and you know
[58:12] that's that's just Elementary balance
[58:14] sheet
[58:15] mathematics um
[58:18] the something you you mentioned about
[58:20] why why don't we have a an apple or we
[58:23] we nearly had a Microsoft but I think
[58:25] the interesting thing there is that the
[58:27] shh holder vote uh in December um was
[58:32] following the recommendations of the
[58:33] board and you all know as well as I do
[58:36] the majority of uh of stock in these
[58:39] very big entities is now held by frankly
[58:42] you know things like exchange traded
[58:43] funds and predominantly all ETFs you
[58:47] know who hold a huge chunk of Microsoft
[58:50] will have a policy that they always vote
[58:52] in a shareholder vote in accordance with
[58:54] the uh instructions from the board and
[58:57] the Microsoft board had recommended a no
[59:00] vote to the consideration of Bitcoin on
[59:02] their Treasury and therefore all of the
[59:04] all of these passive investors voted
[59:07] along with the recommendation of the
[59:08] board and that's entirely normal and one
[59:11] of the reasons why personally I felt
[59:13] that was non story I know everyone got
[59:15] really excited by by the Microsoft board
[59:18] vot Microsoft shareholders voting no but
[59:22] all it takes is a little bit of
[59:23] understanding around how votes
[59:26] ordinarily happen in publicly traded and
[59:28] listed companies to to to be able to
[59:31] predict that that was going to be a no
[59:32] vote anyway um I think back to your
[59:35] original
[59:36] question if
[59:38] bitcoin's price trajectory continues in
[59:41] the way that it is that draws more
[59:44] people in to try and understand why the
[59:47] price is increasing and then you get
[59:49] back to some of the things we talked
[59:50] about at the beginning of the Pod around
[59:52] the fact that it you know it's a hard
[59:54] capped money whose Ledger can't be
[59:56] easily updated which is beyond the
[59:59] control of any nation state and
[60:02] effectively isn't someone else's
[60:04] liability people often say what's
[60:06] Bitcoin backed by and My Views is not
[60:08] backed by anything at all because it's
[60:10] not a
[60:11] liability we in our mind we we we in the
[60:15] same much the same way we were talking
[60:16] about with um copiable digital assets
[60:20] like like pictures on on your desktop um
[60:23] we've all we all have in our minds this
[60:26] this idea that money needs to be backed
[60:28] by something but that's because all of
[60:31] our money is a promise it's um whether
[60:34] it's a whether it's a bank note that you
[60:36] hold in your hand or the numbers that
[60:38] you see when you open your banking app
[60:41] all of those are promises to pay and
[60:44] Bitcoin is not a promise to pay it's
[60:45] it's much like gold really it just is
[60:49] but it's a digital asset not a not a
[60:52] physical asset and as such it doesn't
[60:55] require any backing because it's not
[60:57] it's not a promise it it is the thing
[60:59] itself and you know so I get personally
[61:02] get quite irritated by by people fussing
[61:04] around whe whether it's back by but I
[61:06] think you know that's quite a
[61:08] long-winded answer to your question but
[61:09] I think the the first thing that
[61:11] unfortunately the first thing that draws
[61:13] people in is the price and if Bitcoin
[61:16] 10x is from here uh in the medium to
[61:19] short short to medium term then you're
[61:22] going to get a lot more activist
[61:23] shareholders saying why don't we have
[61:25] exposure to this that's the point of
[61:27] which the career risk flips because
[61:29] people can see you know it's 10x from
[61:32] here and at the same time the value of
[61:35] my pounds has diminished by X amounts
[61:38] destroyed by by CPI and by by by
[61:42] inflation people are going to then the
[61:45] question then becomes why aren't I
[61:46] invested in this rather than why should
[61:48] I invest in this I fully agree with that
[61:52] and I think the priz um people often say
[61:55] like oh we should not focus on the price
[61:57] but it's for me kind of a scoreboard of
[62:00] how bad the feat system is doing on and
[62:03] how quickly it gets adopted uh so it's
[62:06] it it's in in a lot of ways of fair
[62:08] assumption to be honest to look at the
[62:09] price uh for the overall long-term
[62:12] health of it um obviously it should not
[62:15] be the only one like hash rate and other
[62:17] metrics should also get into that uh but
[62:20] the price is something obvious and
[62:22] honestly it's it's sad that we didn't
[62:24] had that in the internet adoption
[62:26] how amazing would that be because the
[62:28] internet adoption didn't had like the
[62:30] tcpip protocol didn't had a native token
[62:34] uh there was there was Apple there was
[62:36] Microsoft there was Amazon and you can
[62:38] kind of attract the the Bitcoin adoption
[62:40] with them but it doesn't directly uh now
[62:43] we can directly uh track the Bitcoin
[62:47] adoption in real time with a tool and
[62:52] yes it's bad because it's not only
[62:55] tracking the ad ad option of of Bitcoin
[62:57] it's also tracking how bad the US dollar
[63:00] or the Euro or whatever currency it is
[63:03] is doing because they're debasing it and
[63:05] Bitcoin gets adopted so like the price
[63:07] has two factors of driving it that the
[63:11] the rate of monetary expansion of the
[63:14] the the Central Bank Plus people getting
[63:17] interested in Bitcoin plus people that
[63:19] already interested in Bitcoin getting
[63:21] more exposure to bitcoin getting from 5%
[63:23] to like 50% uh in there so that's super
[63:26] interesting also to look at uh from a
[63:29] price perspective so um and it's the
[63:32] thing that most people are interested in
[63:34] uh I have a Bitcoin audience if I put uh
[63:37] something with with price related on
[63:39] maybe not even the price like just
[63:41] something that hints on the price people
[63:43] click on that more people are interested
[63:45] in that more it's just we we want to
[63:47] know where this thing is going and uh we
[63:50] want to also uh benefit from it that
[63:53] that's the incentive system in in in our
[63:55] brain like that's the beauty of of
[63:57] Bitcoin to be honest it incentivizes
[63:59] everyone uh to to root for freedom to
[64:03] root for that freedom gr up technology
[64:06] uh and I think that's kind of a
[64:07] beautiful thing and yeah
[64:10] price um it's it's it's sometimes
[64:13] annoying when
[64:15] normies reduce it only to the price um
[64:19] but it's understandable from a human
[64:21] societ from a human psychology
[64:23] standpoint I think yeah I completely
[64:26] agree um I don't know have you seen that
[64:28] old movie Close Encounters of the Third
[64:31] Kind no I've never heard about it it's
[64:34] an early Spielberg film so in the in the
[64:36] movie there were these aliens and they
[64:38] they can only communicate with us by
[64:40] playing four or five notes on a
[64:42] synthesizer um obviously they can't they
[64:45] can't speak our language and we can't
[64:46] speak theirs I often feel that the price
[64:49] is is the way that we have to
[64:52] communicate with normal people there's a
[64:55] there's a lot of other stuff going on in
[64:56] Bitcoin that would be nice to talk about
[64:59] but the price is the easiest way to get
[65:01] that message across most
[65:03] quickly U and you know in monetary
[65:05] economics that's not that's not a bad
[65:07] thing
[65:08] the market price is extraordinarily
[65:11] useful as as you've very clearly clearly
[65:15] described there it's very useful in
[65:18] establishing the the value of what is
[65:20] going on and your your example of tcpip
[65:22] is a great one if there had been a
[65:26] a ready marker to show how valuable the
[65:29] internet was going to become uh then
[65:32] being able to track it in real time on
[65:34] you know coin market cap would have been
[65:36] fantastic I love that example it's
[65:38] really really great idea I I usually try
[65:42] to um because people always say oh uh
[65:46] there there will be another Facebook uh
[65:48] there will be something else that
[65:51] Bitcoin will will be replaced by and
[65:53] they always bring it back to the
[65:54] protocol level because Bitcoin is not an
[65:57] application it's a protocol and
[65:59] protocols usually don't get replaced
[66:01] protocols usually stick around for a
[66:03] very long time the same with the tcpip
[66:06] protocol of the internet we we have it
[66:09] since the beginning it has some changes
[66:11] of course along the way as has Bitcoin
[66:14] with hard and soft Forks um but uh it it
[66:18] will carry on and we might as soon have
[66:21] a new internet uh but that's that's a
[66:24] whole another discussion with Bitcoin
[66:26] because it's money and it's moldable uh
[66:29] and we can if we find a mistake or we
[66:32] find something that we have to upgrade
[66:33] and it's it's lifethreatening to bitcoin
[66:36] we can actually do that I don't know if
[66:38] Bitcoin ever will die like maybe uh in
[66:41] Thousand Years when aliens come and uh
[66:44] they have a better form of money and
[66:46] they forc their monetary policy on us
[66:49] like those things might be possible I
[66:51] don't know uh but uh it's it's hard for
[66:54] me to imagine a a better form of money
[66:57] because it's already digital it's
[66:59] moldable we can if we find something we
[67:02] can in an emergency actually modify it
[67:06] and yeah it's it could be I don't know
[67:09] if it actually will be but it could be
[67:11] the final form of of of money for a very
[67:15] long time and money is usually for a
[67:17] very long time around gold has been for
[67:20] so long already um so dominant in the
[67:23] space so I don't know how how do you see
[67:25] do do you think that Bitcoin has a fair
[67:27] chance to be the money for the next
[67:29] thousands of years eventually I think it
[67:32] has a fair chance um I mean a number of
[67:35] uh bitcoiners that I respect a lot um
[67:38] say you know Bitcoin is a tool and we
[67:41] don't we we don't have any particular
[67:43] you know religious affiliation to it it
[67:45] it is a tool that at the moment
[67:47] functions in the best way possible for
[67:52] discharging of its functions it it still
[67:54] needs to be approved it's it's not hit
[67:56] its perfect form yet uh you know we need
[67:59] to work on on on other layers on top of
[68:01] the base layer protocol but and if you
[68:03] know if another better form of money did
[68:06] emerge then you know we would adopt that
[68:08] because we want what we want is a sound
[68:10] money and we wanton the best form of
[68:12] sound money it's interesting thinking
[68:15] into the far future um there some papers
[68:18] have been done on late on block latency
[68:21] if we become a multiplanetary
[68:23] species so it would be challenging I
[68:27] think to use the same money on different
[68:29] planets and obviously this is getting
[68:31] into very far future science fiction um
[68:35] but I don't think block time I can't
[68:38] from I can't the top of my head remember
[68:40] how many light minutes Mars is from
[68:42] Earth but I don't think
[68:45] Mars sorry we've gone on a proper
[68:47] tangent here I don't think Mars Mars and
[68:51] Earth I don't think could use the same
[68:53] blockchain because of the time period
[68:55] period to communicate information
[68:57] between the two so you might need to use
[68:59] some form of ecash which would then
[69:01] settle once you were able to write
[69:04] transactions to the main blockchain some
[69:07] some interesting papers have been
[69:09] written on this in is various thought
[69:11] experiments but um that's that's a bit
[69:14] of a tangent away from our our original
[69:16] conversation um but
[69:19] yes sorry to interrupt but I think it
[69:21] shows where how great Bitcoin already is
[69:25] because all the things that we can
[69:27] imagine that bring Bitcoin might down is
[69:31] uh oh but what if we cannot use it on
[69:33] mass or
[69:35] hey like like we go so we go so far out
[69:39] uh in thinking of a risk association
[69:42] with Bitcoin uh and then when you assess
[69:44] the risk of like real estate assess the
[69:46] risk of like uh anything else like a
[69:49] stock or something like that you have so
[69:51] normal things that could be risked with
[69:52] Bitcoin we go all out in the Great
[69:55] easiest things and you're like oh like
[69:57] that could be a risk some point so I
[69:59] think that speaks to the strength of
[70:01] Bitcoin and yes there there there will
[70:04] be probably a solution once we get to
[70:06] masss and once there is a let's say a
[70:10] good amount of other species or human
[70:14] beings on Ms that it makes sense to
[70:17] settle with them like right
[70:19] now if there are I don't know 2,000
[70:23] people on Mars uh it they can have their
[70:26] own currency they can have their own
[70:28] systems it doesn't really like we don't
[70:31] need to build now complicated systems to
[70:34] settle with with those 2,000 people if
[70:36] we are like at that point probably like
[70:38] 10 billion or something like that um but
[70:42] long term I think we probably find uh
[70:45] some sort of solution uh where we can
[70:48] settle with those other planets or we
[70:51] find an amazing solution that uh we can
[70:55] use on Earth and all the other planets
[70:57] also and then yeah we we we kind of have
[71:00] to maybe step down and say the same
[71:02] thing that the gold crowd now has to do
[71:05] saying gold was great gold is great but
[71:09] it's it's not ready for the digital life
[71:11] that we have now if before Digital Life
[71:14] Before internet before the electricity
[71:17] everyone would have said like oh of
[71:19] course like gold is the thing like gold
[71:21] is the money like why would we ever need
[71:23] something else but then the internet
[71:25] came around the electricity came around
[71:29] and now we need money that is instantly
[71:32] settled uh between Austria America
[71:35] Australia Africa India UK uh and you can
[71:39] send one transaction through to all
[71:42] those countries within a minute and it
[71:44] costs almost nothing depending on on how
[71:46] you do it and stuff like that and how
[71:48] the fee structure right now is but right
[71:50] now fees I think are really really low
[71:52] um so we need that kind of money now and
[71:55] gold is not viable as a
[71:57] money still not now uh so uh maybe there
[72:02] are there are things coming to bitcoin
[72:06] coming to our Earth coming to our
[72:08] systems that will make Bitcoin look like
[72:12] gold right now and then we Bitcoin Maxes
[72:15] kind of have to step down and say
[72:16] there's a new kid around the block but
[72:20] the one thing I'm saying right now is
[72:23] this is far out in the future yeah this
[72:25] will not happen tomorrow and none of the
[72:28] altcoins fulfill any of those criterias
[72:31] just to be very clear fairly silly point
[72:34] for me to make but there's not a huge
[72:35] amount of Commerce happening on Mars
[72:37] right now so there's not
[72:40] a there's there's not a huge demand for
[72:43] a uh an uncensorable digital money there
[72:47] and um it's it's funny that you know
[72:49] talking about the long longterm future
[72:51] that was where my mind immediately went
[72:53] but um I think it was because I was
[72:54] remembering that that interesting paper
[72:55] around exactly how long it takes for the
[72:58] for the information to be transmitted so
[73:00] that it could be written to the Bas
[73:01] layer again um but and maybe the last
[73:04] thing around around resilience you know
[73:06] obviously the the architecture of
[73:07] Bitcoin is not dissimilar in some ways
[73:09] to the architecture of the early
[73:11] internet arpanet um which was designed
[73:13] to withstand a nuclear strike and you
[73:16] know maybe sort of as a nice way to wrap
[73:19] up is um Satoshi himself said that you
[73:22] know we know that distributed systems
[73:25] are resilient and hard to shut down uh
[73:28] Napster was obviously cap which I
[73:30] mentioned earlier was shut down
[73:32] successfully but Pirate Bay and Nutella
[73:35] uh bit turrent are much much harder to
[73:38] much much harder to stop and it's that
[73:40] element of resilience and you know maybe
[73:42] looping this all the way back to to
[73:45] either a regulator or to a a capital
[73:47] allocator asking why does why does
[73:49] Bitcoin have value not no small part of
[73:53] its value is in the extreme resilience
[73:55] of its system both to change and to
[73:58] Interruption now what other what other
[74:00] system can you point to that's had more
[74:02] than 10 years worth of continuous uptime
[74:04] not a single
[74:05] one no Bank no telecommunications
[74:08] Network um absolutely nothing bitcoin's
[74:11] just been chugging away and it as far as
[74:14] I know I think it only had two tiny
[74:16] periods of downtime in the preceding 5
[74:19] years before before that um that last
[74:22] shutdown um that's an extraordinary
[74:24] record
[74:26] yeah it's the best uh any cyber security
[74:29] guy that looks at Bitcoin is a stunt
[74:31] because they know that no system is
[74:33] secure they know that uh everything has
[74:36] down time and then they look at Bitcoin
[74:37] like what like how many years no down
[74:39] time like how is that possible how it
[74:42] never been hacked like how is that
[74:44] possible so uh Bitcoin is um extremely
[74:48] unique uh and uh we we we didn't cover
[74:52] as much of like UK and FC
[74:55] as as I plan to but it's it's I think
[74:58] it's it's it's a it was a great episode
[75:00] and uh there's a lot of room to
[75:03] discussed for a second round with you
[75:05] along the way um is there anything you
[75:09] wna yeah is there anything you want to
[75:11] add anything that that is really
[75:13] important before we come to the end
[75:14] routines um I think perhaps just just
[75:17] noting on so the general themes we
[75:19] haven't talked about the specifics of
[75:21] regulation in the UK but I think we've
[75:23] covered a lot of the the reasons that
[75:25] people struggle to understand it and
[75:26] that's true both of the regulators and
[75:29] our politicians and also of capital
[75:31] allocators in the UK so if nothing else
[75:34] that was I think personally that was a
[75:36] useful exercise for me in in running
[75:38] through those those ideas and if you did
[75:41] want to chat again in the future we have
[75:42] we have a couple of pieces of feedback
[75:44] that Bitcoin policy UK is working on at
[75:46] the moment one in in relation to to CF
[75:49] the crypto asset reporting framework and
[75:52] another piece of feedback that we're
[75:53] going we're drafting for the FCA
[75:55] which will be submitting in March next
[75:57] year so per perhaps when those two
[75:59] pieces of work are done uh we can have
[76:01] another chat and I can I can run you
[76:03] through some of the detail of those
[76:05] those two pieces of work that we are we
[76:07] working on at the moment absolutely
[76:08] really cool I'm looking forward to
[76:10] having you back on in 2025 for people
[76:12] that watch that probably it's weird
[76:14] because I think this episode will come
[76:16] out in 2025 in January early 20125 so so
[76:21] I I will have you back on uh in the same
[76:24] year because today is the 20th of
[76:25] December I pre-produce a lot of podcast
[76:28] because actually tomorrow is my last
[76:30] recording day and then I'm up to Miami
[76:34] and will be gone for a few days uh will
[76:37] be really cool and yeah we have one
[76:39] question that I asked each and every one
[76:41] of my guests and that is what can we
[76:43] learn from you besides Bitcoin I love
[76:45] 80s action films and uh and bodybuilding
[76:50] so um I'm I like I mentioned I'm I'm
[76:54] getting older like all of us and uh I
[76:57] really keen on staying as fit as I can
[76:59] as long as I can so
[77:02] uh possibly stay staying fit into into
[77:05] middle and old age perhaps really cool
[77:07] yeah it's I love that yeah like old
[77:10] movies and bodybuilding then you
[77:12] probably know arold
[77:14] schwarzeneger the guy that I compared
[77:18] to well he's a great man to be compared
[77:20] to Robin you should be proud yeah
[77:22] absolutely absolutely he has he has
[77:24] achieved a lot in in in his career it's
[77:26] also really uh motivating to to see his
[77:29] work even though I'm not as familiar
[77:30] with what he's actually doing right now
[77:32] I think people assume that I'm a super
[77:34] fan of him but I'm actually not I don't
[77:37] know a lot I saw some that he's in some
[77:40] Santa movie uh oh
[77:43] yes it
[77:45] was it's funny you mentioned him I
[77:47] watched Commando with my girls last
[77:49] weekend uh I've been waiting they were
[77:51] they've been too young until recently
[77:53] but it's it if you've never seen
[77:54] Commando strongly recommended it's
[77:56] absolutely hilarious one of his best and
[77:58] funniest films absolutely wonderful he
[78:01] has produced some some really classic
[78:03] movies are really cool perfect then we
[78:05] have the end routine in the podcast uh
[78:07] it's a it's a big question I think we
[78:09] can make a whole whole podcast out of
[78:11] the this question um the question from
[78:13] the previous guest uh is how will the
[78:16] world be different in 10 years from now
[78:19] because of Bitcoin I would hope the
[78:21] world would be a Freer
[78:23] Place uh because of Bitcoin and the
[78:27] reason I say that is because one of the
[78:29] reasons I'm most excited about it and
[78:32] why I find my work in it most
[78:34] interesting is the the ability that uh
[78:38] it gives to dissidents and Freedom
[78:40] Fighters and those who want to push back
[78:42] against oppressive governments
[78:44] everywhere the toolkit and the power to
[78:47] continue their work and to ensure they
[78:50] can keep making payments and to remain
[78:52] effective so I'm hoping the world will
[78:54] be
[78:55] a more free and equal and therefore a
[78:59] happier place as a result of Bitcoin
[79:01] that's a beautiful way to to end end the
[79:04] podcast thank you so much Freddy for
[79:05] being on before I let you go where can
[79:07] people find you ask your questions and
[79:08] reach out to you FR so the best places
[79:11] on X or on Twitter and my handle is easy
[79:13] it's @ Freddy new um really thank you so
[79:18] much for having me on I've really
[79:19] enjoyed our chat that was really fun
