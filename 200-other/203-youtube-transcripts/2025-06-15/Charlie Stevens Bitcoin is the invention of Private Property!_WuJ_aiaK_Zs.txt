[00:00] the fact that capitalism is seen as evil
[00:03] as well I I just don't think that's
[00:04] helpful that is going to connect people
[00:06] from all sorts of religions races ages
[00:09] for us to be aligned on the same mission
[00:11] of Peace do you really own anything
[00:14] except Bitcoin private capital
[00:16] accumulation which is what Bitcoin
[00:17] really allows us to do I think leads to
[00:19] much more flourishing much more
[00:20] individual purpose and a huge amount
[00:23] more of creativity there is something
[00:25] very unfair about what's happening in
[00:26] the world but it's not the fact that
[00:28] some people have a lot and you don't
[00:29] have much it's the rules of the game by
[00:31] which we're all playing by Bitcoin is
[00:33] the only truly objective Arbiter of
[00:36] private property the Returns on your
[00:38] violence is going to drop massively so I
[00:41] believe the cost of defense is going to
[00:43] drop drastically as well the dollar the
[00:45] Yen all of the Euro all of these symbols
[00:47] symbolize corruption symbolize pollution
[00:50] symbolize dies and Bitcoin symbolizes
[00:54] Purity hope Brilliance I have some bars
[00:57] and restaurants where I actually can pay
[00:58] with Bitcoin in middle of Europe in
[01:01] Austria which is amazing that this is
[01:03] already reality I'm giving you dollar
[01:05] that I know is corrupted devaluing
[01:07] quickly infinitely reproducible for
[01:10] something that you've put so much care
[01:12] and time into that is not a fair
[01:15] [Music]
[01:18] exchange why do you call yourself the
[01:20] natural investor like why why is that
[01:23] it's a lifetime project it's what I want
[01:25] to leave behind for when I die uh so for
[01:30] the world it's been able to combine the
[01:32] money and the Soul so we we can go down
[01:34] this um route if we want but it's after
[01:38] visiting India and being there for four
[01:40] months in deep meditation and and uh
[01:42] training to be a yoga teacher there's a
[01:44] lot of introspection as to what was I
[01:46] about and and the natural investor is
[01:49] what I concluded to as a brand to be
[01:52] able to shine light on to the soul
[01:56] within money which is Bitcoin
[01:58] essentially I think it's like the the
[02:00] soul incarnate in terms of money how it
[02:03] can connect All Souls across the globe
[02:06] and trying to be able to depict that
[02:09] unravel unravel that and trying to build
[02:12] upon that just like philosophers were
[02:14] able to build upon the nature of reality
[02:17] in the past I believe we could we can
[02:19] progress on unraveling reality through
[02:23] the use of Bitcoin and
[02:25] by
[02:27] understanding the flows of life using
[02:30] Bitcoin as our base tool you know
[02:32] because it's how we value everything
[02:33] right
[02:34] so once we connect physical energy with
[02:39] um with our value systems so physical
[02:42] energy is the amount of work that we put
[02:43] in and and then we can connect that with
[02:46] how we value things which is what
[02:47] Bitcoin does then we can really we can
[02:51] bring our own perception of what the
[02:54] world is into kind of Tang tangible and
[02:57] quantifiable um way H and and I think
[03:01] that is going to connect people from all
[03:04] sorts of religions races ages for us to
[03:07] be aligned on the same relatively same
[03:10] mission of of of Peace you know internal
[03:12] peace I I love that connection also
[03:15] really with so you you saying that
[03:17] Bitcoin this uh electronical thing is
[03:21] kind of connecting in a way to Nature
[03:23] because of the sound money
[03:25] principles that you see the natural
[03:27] investor principles yeah I mean the
[03:30] concept of money has been conflated with
[03:32] evil across time like you know the money
[03:35] changers and Jesus coming in and pushing
[03:38] the tables up and you know even in the
[03:41] the Hindu texts and the Jewish texts and
[03:44] all of these spiritual texts they talk
[03:46] about money and how the Love of Money
[03:49] can lead to a bad bad way but I think
[03:52] money's always been able to be corrupted
[03:54] and I do think the love of money is is
[03:56] not a good thing but I think uh being
[04:00] able to accumulate money and being able
[04:01] to use your money adequately being able
[04:03] to allocate it to certain capitals leads
[04:07] to a more fulfilling life I think wealth
[04:09] is a very very very important pillar in
[04:12] everyone's life and if you don't have
[04:15] you cannot give with an empty bucket
[04:18] right you cannot give to others so I
[04:20] think being able to know how to
[04:22] accumulate correctly how to invest your
[04:25] money into capital goods which allow you
[04:27] to be able to give to others
[04:30] is well including yourself obviously is
[04:33] a really really
[04:35] important important thing that people
[04:37] don't talk about and especially in in a
[04:39] communist world right they they strip
[04:42] you from property rights they strip you
[04:44] from capital and they concentrate all of
[04:46] that capital and all of that property
[04:48] into a centralized area which means that
[04:52] people cannot give they they cannot give
[04:54] because they've been stripped of what
[04:56] they've been able to give so private
[04:58] capital accumul which is what Bitcoin
[05:01] really allows us to do uh I think leads
[05:03] to much more flourishing much more
[05:05] individual purpose and a huge amount
[05:08] more of creativity which we're we're
[05:10] getting to see here in El Salvador at
[05:12] the moment so that's the yeah that's the
[05:15] general principle of the natural
[05:17] investor is is is understanding money
[05:20] capital and investment It's s
[05:22] fascinating for me because I love that
[05:25] perspective then I see because like just
[05:28] like in two days like not even two days
[05:30] like one day a little bit more than that
[05:33] we have Austrian elections here in
[05:36] Austria and I saw some of the debates
[05:39] just just because I was curious and
[05:41] there's like
[05:42] this the libertarian parties there's the
[05:45] left Ling parties or right wing parties
[05:47] and all those different kind of parties
[05:49] especially from like half the aisle
[05:52] there's this thinking of like oh wealth
[05:55] accumulation is something evil
[05:58] especially if you do too much of that
[06:00] and we have to take from them because
[06:03] they have too much and it's that's a bad
[06:05] thing and we have to tax them it's not
[06:07] fair like all those things and that
[06:09] seems to be extremely popular especially
[06:12] a young along the the young crowd I feel
[06:15] like that's like a yeah it's it's unfair
[06:18] that I don't have anything and then
[06:19] there's like those those Big Rich guys
[06:21] that have
[06:22] everything what why do you think is that
[06:25] a natural thing to to have and and it
[06:27] seems like to to change a little bit
[06:28] with reality coming in and then like oh
[06:31] yeah it actually makes sense like if you
[06:32] don't have an incentive to work then
[06:34] nobody will do anything so there has to
[06:37] be some incentive for the free market to
[06:40] to actually Prosper so like that's
[06:41] that's for me so fascinating to see the
[06:44] way I look at it is that maybe the young
[06:45] people believe that there is something
[06:47] unfair which is true there is something
[06:49] very unfair about what's happening in
[06:51] the world but it's not the fact that
[06:53] some people have a lot and you don't
[06:54] have much it's the rules of the game by
[06:57] which we're all playing by right it's
[06:59] the it's the way by which though that
[07:01] accumulation of capital happens which is
[07:03] unfair that the rules are malleable and
[07:06] they they move at depending on the
[07:09] emotions of the politicians or who has
[07:11] who has control of the monetary units at
[07:13] the time so I believe that the the
[07:17] unfairness is H is a Justified emotion
[07:20] that the young people have and they're
[07:22] trying to understand it and then then
[07:25] the politicians I don't even think the
[07:27] politicians understand it themselves and
[07:30] we always try and find a reason for
[07:31] things no matter what no matter how
[07:33] ignorant we are about what really is
[07:36] happening we always try and explain it
[07:38] with some sort of conclusion so it fits
[07:42] your current understanding of the world
[07:44] and you think this is going to get you
[07:45] out of the unfairness you're going to go
[07:47] for it and you're going to feel
[07:48] passionate for it because you know
[07:50] there's there's definitely something
[07:51] deeply wrong with what's happening in
[07:53] the world but it it's much more nuanced
[07:56] and you need to understand what does c
[07:59] mean and yeah even like what leads to
[08:01] productivity what leads to the pro
[08:03] prospering of Nations and I mean I think
[08:06] the the the principle of private
[08:09] property itself is not talked about
[08:11] enough uh and when when I started
[08:13] reading about John Lock and and his
[08:16] thesis on private property from the 1600
[08:20] it blew my mind it blew my mind as to as
[08:23] to how this was basically the
[08:25] underpinnings of the advancement of
[08:27] civilization and think Revolution and
[08:31] capitalism and the the fact that
[08:33] capitalism is seen as evil as well I I
[08:36] just don't think that's helpful I don't
[08:38] think it's helpful for the world so I
[08:41] think it's Justified not feeling good
[08:43] about what's happening but I think we
[08:45] just need to shine more light
[08:47] on real economics real economics because
[08:50] you can say Bitcoin but if you don't
[08:53] understand how stream economics works
[08:56] it's really hard to fully grasp Bitcoin
[08:58] right
[09:00] find it hard to see how you could ABS
[09:03] yeah it's interesting
[09:05] also private property is interesting for
[09:07] me because since I get Bitcoin I'm like
[09:11] is there even a private property without
[09:13] Bitcoin like do you really own anything
[09:16] except Bitcoin it's like before I was
[09:18] like yeah private property you own your
[09:20] house like you have the keys to your
[09:21] house like no but has like police
[09:24] outside of the door and they're like hey
[09:25] sorry that that house is no longer yours
[09:28] it's not yours Bitcoin is kind of theit
[09:31] Bitcoin is kind of the invention of
[09:33] private property as I see wow yeah it's
[09:36] like private property
[09:38] incarnate pretty much exactly what
[09:40] you're saying and I had a conversation
[09:42] with another best friend of mine from
[09:44] years we studied uh mathematics together
[09:46] in University and he now lives in El
[09:49] Salvador we're best friends we've
[09:50] traveled across the globe together but
[09:52] we were talking about something that's
[09:53] really a sensitive issue right now which
[09:56] is uh land and if you've if you've
[10:00] if you've been pushed out of your land
[10:01] or if your land has been robbed from you
[10:04] after how many
[10:05] generations did do you have a say on
[10:09] that piece of land you know obviously
[10:11] with Israel and Palestine it's a huge
[10:12] thing but it's across the globe it's
[10:15] generations of this is mine and and who
[10:18] who says who what what is whose right
[10:21] who is the governor of that
[10:24] and ultimately the like you're saying
[10:27] Bitcoin is the only
[10:30] truly objective Arbiter of private
[10:32] property because if you're able to
[10:35] defend your land even if you've robbed
[10:38] it that's what's happening at the moment
[10:40] you know in different places Israel has
[10:41] that land because it's well able to
[10:43] defend that land you know
[10:44] and Palestine it doesn't have rain over
[10:49] that land because it's not it doesn't
[10:50] have the the arms or the weapons you
[10:52] know it can't project the force and the
[10:54] whole world might be in disagreement
[10:56] with it
[10:57] but or with thing or the other but at
[11:00] the end of the day you know come take
[11:02] this land right I've got the weapons
[11:05] it's so you you you'd like to say oh we
[11:09] all agree on these nations being these
[11:12] nations but push comes to show of if you
[11:14] can push if push someone out of there
[11:16] then you can push someone out of there
[11:18] equ absolutely it's it's uh it's it's
[11:22] amazing because even like people tell me
[11:25] that someone could still put a gun to
[11:27] your head but you still have to
[11:29] the option to die with your Bitcoin and
[11:33] that gives you all the leverage because
[11:35] if you if someone wants to steal your
[11:38] Bitcoin if they kill you your Bitcoin
[11:41] are gone they they they are gone with
[11:44] you granted you're then still not there
[11:48] like it's not a good outcome for you but
[11:50] it's the best outcome in that situation
[11:52] for you with Bitcoin with everything
[11:54] else if you have a bar of gold in your
[11:56] hand it's like it just take it away from
[11:58] you that's that's like such a simple
[12:00] thing and especially if you do a daily
[12:03] Bitcoin podcast it's sometimes um
[12:06] because you hear those things so many
[12:07] times it's so clear for you that that
[12:09] you feel stupid for even saying them but
[12:12] then when you go out in the in the
[12:14] normal world where they never really
[12:16] heard about Bitcoin then you're like
[12:18] this things are blowing their minds
[12:20] they're like what like is that actually
[12:22] possible so it's it's I think we we have
[12:25] to always get rooted in the in the
[12:27] basics but one thing that
[12:29] right yeah definitely absolutely one
[12:31] thing that I also want to do um get into
[12:34] the vi what what do you think when we
[12:36] have now this private properties when we
[12:38] have now this pristine pristine asset
[12:41] with with
[12:42] Bitcoin what impact do you think this
[12:44] will have on Wars on borders on nation
[12:47] states and all those things especially
[12:49] as you are traveled a lot you're now in
[12:52] Salvador you see a lot what do you think
[12:55] the impact on those things will have
[12:58] with Bitcoin well this is a huge
[13:00] question and there's a lot of theories
[13:02] that are floating around you have the
[13:04] Sovereign Sovereign independent
[13:06] individual thesis that nation states
[13:10] basically dissolve borders dissolve
[13:13] because they're defended by its own you
[13:16] know currency essentially so all defense
[13:21] mechanisms are paid by usually the
[13:23] government like the national government
[13:25] that that was the initial reasoning for
[13:27] government is to be able to to hold
[13:30] private property for the citizens within
[13:32] so that it's not taken from them from
[13:34] from other countries or from people
[13:36] within that country I think that we are
[13:40] going to have a lot
[13:42] of private Capital much more private
[13:45] Capital that's built up people are going
[13:48] to be brought together on
[13:52] more
[13:54] fundamental principles I think that
[13:56] religions are going to still
[13:59] be a thing and people are going to come
[14:01] together based on their shared values
[14:04] and those who
[14:06] are together on their shared values I
[14:09] think there's going to be a lot
[14:11] of uh
[14:13] defense systems that are fueled by
[14:15] Bitcoin deposits so you have the option
[14:18] to be based on who you identify with who
[14:22] who do you which values you identify
[14:24] with you allocate a certain amount of
[14:26] your Bitcoin flow or your Bitcoin
[14:28] savings into certain defense systems
[14:32] that protect uh to protect your your
[14:36] group your cohort of individuals from
[14:39] from private property I also think the
[14:42] Returns on your violence is going to
[14:46] drop massively so I believe the cost of
[14:48] defense is going to drop drastically as
[14:52] well here in El Salvador is a brilliant
[14:55] example where you know you had a guard
[14:58] for every every single shop that existed
[15:01] pretty much across an Salvador and in
[15:04] other cities and towns across the
[15:06] country each guard has to be paid a wage
[15:09] that guard has a shotgun that that c
[15:12] that has a cost itself then you have the
[15:16] individuals who are in the shop who are
[15:17] worried about getting you know you know
[15:20] getting caught so they can only move
[15:23] from the shop to their house they can't
[15:25] move in other areas to sell their
[15:27] product or service they're Market
[15:29] reduces drastically people are only
[15:31] contained within their towns and they
[15:33] can't move and sell to other clients
[15:36] you've got barbed wire at the top of
[15:38] your at the top of your walls you had
[15:42] shops that couldn't display their their
[15:44] name they remained hidden so that the
[15:46] gangs would not know that that existed
[15:48] so that they wouldn't extort that area
[15:51] so you had a huge amount of investment
[15:54] on just defending property now in El
[15:57] Salvador there's no work at all so when
[16:00] you're building buildings there's no
[16:02] extra barbed wire no shops are hiring
[16:06] guards to be able to protect themselves
[16:08] people are selling their product Across
[16:11] the Nation so they have not one two
[16:14] three four times the amount of clients
[16:16] they have about 50 or 100 x to the
[16:19] market and they can just distribute
[16:21] their their uh product around so the the
[16:26] cost of defense is going to drop down a
[16:28] lot
[16:30] think the state depending on how United
[16:35] your people are as a nation you know I
[16:38] feel like Islands might be more united
[16:40] or PE things that are geographically
[16:43] isolated or um you know Nations that
[16:48] have had a long long history might take
[16:51] much more longer to dissolve and they'll
[16:54] have their own systems in place and
[16:57] their own ways of governing and you'll
[16:59] have different layers of governing
[17:02] systems uh based on how many people so
[17:06] like in Switzerland you have the
[17:07] different cantons right and you've got
[17:10] the tax system this is I'm coming from
[17:13] very superficial I'm very ignorant on
[17:15] this topic but from what I understand
[17:17] the tax taxes are higher for the
[17:20] local for the locality so for the town
[17:23] and then the municipality then increases
[17:26] or decreases and then the Fed federal
[17:29] taxes are quite low so I believe that we
[17:32] will end up kind of taking on that sort
[17:35] of tax system on different layers where
[17:38] you pay the most for just your local
[17:39] town because that's that's how you know
[17:42] the people around you know exactly what
[17:44] you need the most you know you can vote
[17:46] for your bridge to be built around you
[17:49] and that's where your money is going
[17:51] towards but you do know economies of
[17:54] scale is definitely a valuable thing so
[17:57] I think it would be efficient to
[17:59] allocate some of your income or some of
[18:02] your savings to a larger cohort of
[18:06] individuals so that would be more like
[18:08] large scale defense
[18:10] maybe air defense uh systems you know
[18:14] that take a huge amount of capital
[18:16] initial
[18:18] Capital energy plants you know energy
[18:20] plants take a lot of initial Capital
[18:21] nuclear plants that you know you you're
[18:24] not going to chip in a for a town of
[18:27] 2,000 people into a nuclear plant but
[18:29] you're better off doing it with like
[18:30] millions of people right H so I believe
[18:33] that the the tear of Taxation it'll be
[18:37] much more uh optional you know but you
[18:40] can't partake in the services that you
[18:43] don't your money towards and I I believe
[18:45] that's going to be kind of I mean that's
[18:48] not super clear but I do think that um
[18:52] you know people just increasing your tax
[18:54] taxes like that isn't going to be
[18:56] possible they're going to have to ask
[18:57] for permission listen
[18:59] you have the option to increase your tax
[19:00] rate these are the benefits of you
[19:02] increasing your tax rate and if the
[19:05] politicians don't follow through with
[19:07] those outcomes they're out even a smart
[19:11] contract you know what I mean that could
[19:13] enable
[19:14] that but we're just RI riing here it's
[19:19] it's it's so cool I love it a lot it's
[19:21] also interesting because you are in
[19:23] Salvador and there is like Ground Zero
[19:26] of Bitcoin nation state adoption as I
[19:28] call it it's like uh not 100% there but
[19:32] we already see the first uh let's see
[19:35] the first cycle of Bitcoin adoption in
[19:37] an actual nation that that has uh what
[19:40] is it six to seven million people or
[19:42] something like that uh which is an an a
[19:45] good size like a good founding crowd
[19:49] where we can see what's happening from
[19:51] your perspective what do you think is
[19:55] out influences of like when you have a
[19:57] Bitcoin Circle economies when you have
[20:00] this slow process of starting you
[20:02] mentioned already the the cost of
[20:03] defense is there something else that you
[20:05] witnessed of like people maybe taking
[20:08] different financial decisions and
[20:10] influencing that on a family or
[20:13] individual
[20:14] level what else can you show us from
[20:17] Salvador what already happened in maybe
[20:20] also in Berlin with with some
[20:21] Investments you you've
[20:23] seen I was just talking to someone few
[20:27] minutes ago uh and he was staying in a
[20:31] really cheap Airbnb in San Salvador the
[20:34] capital city but it was a lovely area
[20:37] and your man basically built a huge
[20:41] reservoir of around five times I think
[20:45] five times 12 like something like
[20:49] uh like thousands of gallons essentially
[20:53] like tens and tens of thousands of
[20:54] gallons underneath the the building and
[20:58] he's colle collecting rainwater and he's
[21:00] using that rain water that's underneath
[21:02] his his house to fuel the showers and
[21:05] the toilets and the Taps and stuff like
[21:07] that and he's got a good pumping system
[21:09] H the cost of water in San Salvador is
[21:12] much higher than around here so it could
[21:14] be a monthly fee of $3 for water around
[21:18] here in Berlin but in the city it could
[21:20] be $50 and what he did there was he did
[21:24] a big investment on being able to
[21:29] put a fish a large quantity of water to
[21:31] reduce his water bills massively I think
[21:34] this is the epitome of the types of
[21:36] decisions that are starting to be taken
[21:38] here where people are thinking much more
[21:41] in the future being able to reduce their
[21:43] ongoing costs by being able to implement
[21:48] infrastructure in their own
[21:51] locality that will allow them to be more
[21:53] productive high high have higher savings
[21:55] rates I'm living in Berlin at the moment
[21:57] Berlin is a town on a volcano in the
[22:00] middle of El Salvador and there's 150
[22:05] megawatt energy plant with mining here
[22:09] and there's over 130 vendors who are
[22:11] accepting Bitcoin we just had a class
[22:13] about 30 minutes ago in here about 50
[22:17] students came from the high school to
[22:19] come and write all they all writing down
[22:21] their 12 words how to lock in their seed
[22:25] phrase how to recover
[22:26] it so Bitcoin coin is more impregnated
[22:31] into the consciousness of the humans
[22:33] around here that's that's just a fact uh
[22:37] the idea of of inflation and that the
[22:41] currency is debasing is common knowledge
[22:44] among the students now across the whole
[22:46] nation it's like no like you know why
[22:49] would you do that should it's losing
[22:50] purchasing power it's like it's like a a
[22:53] given thing so that the seed has been
[22:57] has been made for all the students
[23:00] you've got family men with kids who are
[23:04] previously just had maybe a printing
[23:06] shop and maybe catered For the local
[23:08] town now thinking of expanding in four
[23:10] different locations and having that
[23:12] ability to foresee the next few years
[23:15] and expect there to be an increase in
[23:18] business and increase of Tourism you've
[23:21] got a lot of people who I
[23:25] mean El Salvador already had a high
[23:28] birth rate but mothers are much more
[23:31] willing to have kids around here
[23:33] compared to Western countries you know I
[23:36] talk to other people across Ireland and
[23:40] Spain
[23:41] and a lot of women don't want to have
[23:43] babies and a lot of men don't either
[23:44] right they the the pessimism that is
[23:47] there is is very tangible and the
[23:50] feasibility of being able to have kids
[23:52] obviously is just not there when you're
[23:54] when you're working off of a highly
[23:56] debasing currency so
[23:59] you're seeing a lot more children a lot
[24:00] of baby showers you're seeing optimism
[24:03] in the kids coming out of school you're
[24:06] seeing people uh extending their
[24:08] timeline in terms of the decisions that
[24:10] they're making so are your actions
[24:13] orientated towards a project that is a
[24:17] couple of months or is it a 10 15 30 40
[24:21] year project that your that your actions
[24:24] are geared towards so you've got a lot
[24:26] of longtime preference you got a ton of
[24:29] bitcoiners coming here and living here
[24:31] permanently so all of this permeates
[24:35] that culture does permeate through into
[24:37] society as well obviously I'm in a
[24:40] bubble here you know I've a lot of most
[24:44] of the people I interact with are
[24:45] bitcoiners or local salvadorenos but H
[24:48] it's super tangible the development in
[24:50] the country is pretty decentralized it's
[24:53] not all concentrated in San Salvador you
[24:55] can go to local towns around Berlin and
[24:57] you'll see bustling infrastructure being
[25:00] built new houses being
[25:03] constructed paint jobs you see people
[25:07] increasing the quality of their clothing
[25:09] so yeah that just a lot of more higher
[25:13] level thinking people increasing their
[25:16] quality of life and yeah changing their
[25:20] own perspective of who they are I think
[25:22] that's the beauty of it all like
[25:24] ultimately the decisions you make in
[25:26] life I find are based on who you think
[25:28] you are right if you think you are a
[25:31] waster you're just going to go and do
[25:33] things that wasters do if you think
[25:35] you're supposed to change the world and
[25:37] make a huge difference and this is your
[25:40] responsibility your actions are going to
[25:42] be geared towards that so people's
[25:44] perception of who they are is improving
[25:47] and the the capabilities that the
[25:50] capacity of them to increase the quality
[25:53] of
[25:54] life is becoming much more apparent if
[25:58] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[26:00] regular basis I'll guess you already
[26:02] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[26:05] important step is to keep the Bitcoin

[27:13] not least I have something completely
[27:15] new for you guys I partnered up with
[27:19] coin vigilante this is the most
[27:21] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[27:24] saw created by anyone look at that
[27:27] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[27:30] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[27:33] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[27:36] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[27:39] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[27:42] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[27:45] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:49] watch collections you have the date of
[27:51] the first ever minded Bitcoin Block in
[27:54] there and of course also the block
[27:56] height and which P we are currently in I
[28:00] love the level of detail they put in in
[28:03] this masterpiece and make sure to check
[28:05] out those amazing coin vilante the time
[28:08] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[28:11] those watches so so much that's
[28:15] beautiful I love L it a lot already I'm
[28:19] also with berin and Bitcoin Beach and
[28:23] and S Salvador all those places you can
[28:26] probably already see this circle economy
[28:30] flowing a little bit more like I have it
[28:33] now even in Austria a little little
[28:35] little little little bit where most of
[28:38] my sponsors pay me Bitcoin and I have
[28:41] some bars and restaurants where I
[28:42] actually can pay with Bitcoin in middle
[28:45] of Europe in Austria which is amazing
[28:47] that this is uh already reality it's not
[28:51] like I can pay everything but I can pay
[28:53] like 1% of my expenses uh with Bitcoin
[28:56] Which is far away from the go
[28:59] but then I imagine if this is already a
[29:02] little bit possible in Austria how
[29:04] amazing it would be already in El
[29:06] Salvador where there also no taxes on on
[29:09] bitcoin transactions which is a huge
[29:12] thing in Austria I'm lucky do have
[29:15] bought Bitcoin in an area where those
[29:17] Bitcoins are not tax uh tax implication
[29:22] yeah so it's attached to your
[29:24] identity the Bitcoin oh yeah hey
[29:29] yeah yeah um Mo most of it uh it's it's
[29:31] like um when I first bought Bitcoin it's
[29:34] like the okay let's first break it down
[29:36] the tax thing uh Austria made it uh a
[29:42] tax law that from February I think 2021
[29:47] it was all Bitcoin has to be like taxed
[29:50] with uh 27% on the profits before that
[29:55] if you have Bitcoin before that you
[29:56] don't have to pay taxes for that
[29:58] uh and it's possible to get non KC
[30:02] Bitcoin but KC Bitcoin is the way more
[30:06] convenient and easier and faster way
[30:09] that's a little bit of the problem
[30:10] because I think probably 95 or 99% of
[30:15] the people here in Austria they get the
[30:17] KFC uh Bitcoin because it's just so
[30:20] convenient it's just so much easier it's
[30:23] literally to make an example uh if I go
[30:26] from my bank account
[30:28] to my multi signature Hardware uh setup
[30:33] multi um self cust setup it takes me
[30:37] five to 10 minutes from the bank account
[30:40] to The Exchange to the hard like that's
[30:42] that's really really quickly uh from
[30:45] like an onboarding process do you use do
[30:47] you use 21 yeah I use 21 21
[30:51] Bitcoin it's Austrian it's Austrian
[30:55] company Austrian bank account they're
[30:57] they're working really good together and
[30:59] it's the the quickest way probably in us
[31:01] to be on boarded on on bitcoin but there
[31:05] are non KC options there's even like
[31:08] local Bitcoin meetups where you can do
[31:11] that really peer-to-peer where you can
[31:13] get cash there and get Bitcoin there
[31:15] like those things happen how how is that
[31:18] in in El actually probably there has no
[31:20] kvc exchanges or never asked that
[31:22] question actually yeah well you've got a
[31:25] lot of people coming with cash so uh
[31:29] Berlin actually is flush with Bitcoin so
[31:32] you've got loads of stores that have oh
[31:36] the local supermarket has thousands of
[31:39] dollars in Bitcoin and they're looking
[31:40] for cash to pay for some of their
[31:43] expenses so you've got people coming
[31:45] from the States
[31:47] Australia France who are looking to buy
[31:50] non kyc Bitcoin they can access cash
[31:53] pretty easily here they can take it out
[31:55] pretty much fee free and then they can
[31:56] buy with their cash all of this non kyc
[32:00] Bitcoin and they're just stacking hard
[32:02] so you have a beautiful uh meeting of
[32:06] bitcoiners who are gagging for non kyc
[32:09] Bitcoin who are looking for it and then
[32:11] local stores who are more than happy to
[32:12] have a fluid transaction with no fees
[32:16] just sending lightning and getting
[32:19] getting cash so that they can pay their
[32:21] providers for so there's a there's it's
[32:23] a liquidity pool here in Berlin in terms
[32:25] of cash to to to Bitcoin and the aim is
[32:29] to bolster this out and to to make it
[32:31] you know much much much higher level the
[32:34] aim always with each of the vendors that
[32:37] we come across is
[32:39] to uh not use any of the Bitcoin ATMs
[32:43] because the Bitcoin goes outside of the
[32:45] town but to be able to use uh the
[32:47] options that they have within so that we
[32:49] have Bitcoin circulating within the town
[32:51] more Bitcoin that we have circulating
[32:53] the town the
[32:54] average net wealth of individuals
[32:57] increas increases as Bitcoin comes up so
[32:59] that means you know Berlin's net wealth
[33:03] is quite well proportion like um
[33:07] correlated towards the increase in
[33:09] bitcoin's price as an economy you know
[33:11] like if it's circul if if it's moving
[33:14] from Individual to individual and store
[33:16] between stor and bitcoin's purchasing
[33:19] power increases exponentially and
[33:21] Bitcoin isn't leaving that town then
[33:23] this town kind of increases with that
[33:25] right and each individual can then make
[33:27] make their own decisions on how to use
[33:29] that Bitcoin for for for their own
[33:31] business the the the meetups are really
[33:35] good you've got some real characters
[33:38] coming through here people who've
[33:40] lived all sorts of lives and they've
[33:43] gotten into Bitcoin through different
[33:45] reasons and they can they can give to
[33:48] the town in different ways you know
[33:49] you've got permaculture experts people
[33:51] who've set up multiple businesses
[33:54] businesses in Hong Kong for years
[33:56] businesses in the states where they've
[33:59] set up wedding States and they've just
[34:02] come to live in this small Salvador new
[34:04] town to live on a Bitcoin standard and
[34:09] build their own business it's it's it's
[34:10] really beautiful really really cool uh I
[34:13] love to see that how how in general how
[34:16] important do you see in general that we
[34:17] have those big Bitcoin circular
[34:19] economies that flourishing of Bitcoin
[34:22] not for that town specifically but for
[34:24] Bitcoin adoption in general people talk
[34:26] about this and
[34:28] and want to get this message across to
[34:31] people the dollar symbol the Euro symbol
[34:34] the Yen symbol all of these
[34:37] symbols and it's important because we're
[34:39] we're run by symbols you know the cross
[34:42] we're run by indu these are symbols that
[34:45] I've come across from Millennia symbols
[34:48] are extremely important we're run by
[34:49] symbols right Carl y has talked about
[34:51] this those kids see this before they
[34:54] even see they see it in their dreams
[34:55] before they see it in reality it's it's
[34:57] in the Collective unconscience okay
[34:59] symbols run Humanity the dollar the Yen
[35:03] all of the Euro all of these symbols
[35:05] symbolize corruption symbolize pollution
[35:08] symbolize dies
[35:12] and you know I'm not you know it's all
[35:14] that's not all doom and gloom but
[35:16] Bitcoin symbolizes Purity hope light
[35:21] Brilliance right
[35:23] and even if you're storing Bitcoin but
[35:26] you're using dollars yens and you're
[35:28] using Euros to be able to exchange for
[35:32] goods that you eat and that you live in
[35:34] and that you use for your car to run
[35:37] you're you're when I when if you're if
[35:39] you're selling me a fresh Apple that
[35:41] you've harvested from your farm that
[35:43] you've tooken really good care of and
[35:45] I'm giving you dollar that I know is
[35:48] corrupted devaluing quickly infinitely
[35:52] reproducible I'm giving you [ __ ] for
[35:54] something that you've put so much care
[35:57] and time into in exchange that is not a
[36:01] fair exchange that is not a fair the the
[36:05] the it's not equal and if we keep doing
[36:08] this if we keep using dollars and all
[36:10] all of these currency units that
[36:12] represent corruption for goods and
[36:15] services if you if you extrapolate that
[36:18] to Infinity as you do in mathematics you
[36:20] know as the limit goes towards
[36:23] Infinity all of the goods and services
[36:25] that you get in return are going to turn
[36:27] to [ __ ] they're going to be corrupted
[36:28] they're going to be bad they're going to
[36:31] be bad for us the food that we're going
[36:32] to eat is going to turn bad so it's
[36:35] really important that the exchange of
[36:38] goods and services is done with Bitcoin
[36:40] and it's done with this Purity because
[36:42] what this this reiterates to you every
[36:45] time you receive Bitcoin for a good or
[36:47] service that you give is that you're
[36:49] receiving something that's ultimately
[36:51] scarce it's ultimately pure it's
[36:54] ultimately brilliant and you're going to
[36:57] you're going to be incentivized to
[36:58] produce that you're going to be
[37:00] incentivized to produce the highest
[37:01] quality product products that will last
[37:04] a long time like the Toyotas built in
[37:07] the 90s you're going to be uh focused on
[37:10] creating
[37:11] extremely high quality watchet and
[37:14] chocolates just like the the Swiss and
[37:16] the engines just like the Germans you
[37:18] know you're going to be you know you're
[37:20] you're going to
[37:21] be focused on delivering quality and if
[37:26] we don't have these circuit economies if
[37:28] we don't have these areas where people
[37:31] refuse to use the symbols that represent
[37:34] corruption and we won't advance as
[37:36] Society we're not going to be able to
[37:38] build on on top of something brilliant
[37:42] we're not going to be able to stop the
[37:44] wars and
[37:47] the the deceit and the corruption that
[37:50] exists behind all of the the Smoky
[37:53] mirrors um so I think I think ultimately
[37:56] it starts in circular economies I think
[37:58] the Bitcoin Revolution the worldwide
[38:01] Bitcoin Revolution starts in all of
[38:02] these Bitcoin circular economies so if
[38:05] if you're in a situation where you have
[38:07] the option but you want to make a bit
[38:09] more money uh a bit more fiash because
[38:12] you need to make more Bitcoin and this
[38:14] is your chance you need to take a risk
[38:16] you need to take a wage cut you need to
[38:19] be able to you know this is more than
[38:21] just you this is the world right this is
[38:24] the world that we're talking about and
[38:26] the decisions that we make now impact
[38:29] the children that we leave the world to
[38:31] once we die and the sooner we move over
[38:35] to these circular economies the sooner
[38:37] we move over to bitcoin the more options
[38:40] that our children have the more peace
[38:42] that they'll find the better quality
[38:43] families that they'll
[38:45] form the more honest and trustful the
[38:48] relationships are between individuals in
[38:50] these different areas which is
[38:52] ultimately what we want we want we want
[38:54] to be spoken truthfully and honestly and
[38:57] we want to to eat really high quality
[38:59] things and hear beautiful music and look
[39:02] at incredible art and have a strong
[39:04] connection to God we all strive for
[39:07] these things this is this is our
[39:09] opportunity it seems like Bitcoin is the
[39:14] moral form of money it's the it's the
[39:18] ethics it's the money that besides the
[39:22] monetary aspect it's the ethnic and
[39:25] moral thing to do to use coin it's it's
[39:28] it's it's it seems to like be like even
[39:30] Beyond monetary incentives be a really
[39:33] good choice for you yeah yeah right and
[39:38] it's a it's it's an honor to be able to
[39:41] be a part of this at such an early stage
[39:43] and to be able to have conversations
[39:46] with individuals like yourself
[39:49] Robin absolutely really cool um coming
[39:53] to a conversation that we have I think
[39:55] we should also touch on the adopting
[39:58] Bitcoin conference that is coming up in
[40:01] November I think 1th November 16th
[40:05] November some somewhere around that it's
[40:06] the 15th and 16th of November almost I
[40:10] almost got it yeah 15 16th there'll be
[40:13] plenty of stuff going on in the on the
[40:15] 16th and 17th and 18th as well in El
[40:17] Salvador lot of side events a lot I will
[40:20] I will be there from 11th to 18th I
[40:23] think I think that that week I will be
[40:26] there 11th to 18th of November so I'm
[40:28] looking forward to like going through as
[40:31] much El Salvadorian experiences as
[40:34] possible but yeah like you're also
[40:36] organizer so like how's coming the the
[40:38] conference along and and what can we
[40:40] expect the conference has
[40:43] been real experience organizing this
[40:47] it's a really strong team that we have
[40:49] organizing it led by Kamal who's ran it
[40:52] for the last three years this is going
[40:54] to be the fourth year of adopting
[40:56] Bitcoin we're expecting over a thousand
[40:58] attendees coming from all over the world
[41:00] also a really strong cohort of of
[41:02] salvadorenos who want to learn more
[41:04] about Bitcoin and and network with other
[41:07] individuals coming from across the globe
[41:10] it's it's the conference is on the 15th
[41:12] and
[41:13] 16th
[41:14] and H there are side events beforehand
[41:17] me Premier Bitcoin I have a they have a
[41:21] graduation which is amazing it's an
[41:23] amazing experience Robin so you should
[41:24] definitely check that out where you have
[41:28] bitcoiners who go and test the students
[41:32] to see their Bitcoin knowledge and if

[42:06] it is mainly geared towards policy
[42:10] decision makers and people who are
[42:13] curious as to how mining can you know
[42:17] help the ecosystem how it can bolster
[42:20] energy grades and how you know it's not
[42:23] a dirty coin essentially I highly
[42:25] recommend people to check that out

[52:17] overview didn't you about those amazing
[52:21] side or satellite satellite events how
[52:24] they call it on the website they are
[52:26] really good usually I'm not that big of
[52:28] a fan of the side events they're like

[52:46] all my partners code Robin just type it
[52:49] in try if you can find a discount there
[52:52] should be available and should be
[52:54] already online looking forward to seeing
[52:57] as many people as possible there I saw
[52:59] the guest list like the speaker list and
[53:01] I was like oh there are like in every
[53:03] row at least like two three people that
[53:04] are already interviewed or know or know
[53:07] in some sense so like you you will see a
[53:09] lot of uh if you're used to that podcast
[53:11] you will see in El Salvador a lot of
[53:13] familiar faces there uh just from the
[53:16] speakers and then there's like a
[53:18] thousand people
[53:19] coming additionally to that and you will
[53:21] see a lot of people that have a lot of
[53:23] similarities with you the one thing that
[53:25] I'm like I have two really big passiones
[53:28] in Bitcoin the first is like self-
[53:29] custody and and then the second is like
[53:31] meet other bitcoiners I love when we can
[53:34] go to a local Bitcoin meet up that's the
[53:36] easiest thing everyone can do everyone
[53:38] can go just to a restaurant and invest
[53:40] like 10 EUR to find another bitcoiner or
[53:43] you don't even have to order something
[53:44] you just like meet other bitcoiners and
[53:47] then is like of course the Bitcoin
[53:49] conferences that you can go do there's
[53:51] orange bill app there's so many
[53:52] different Avenues you can go through but
[53:54] make sure to meet other bit bitcoiners
[53:57] it's a game changer in your Bitcoin
[53:59] knowledge in your networking it's a game
[54:02] changer in your energy that you get from
[54:04] those bitcoiners it completely changed
[54:06] my life like the first Bitcoin
[54:09] conference in Prague was kind of the
[54:11] starting point for me to really take my
[54:14] online presence and my let's make
[54:17] advertisement for Bitcoin that's what
[54:19] I'm all about making orange billing
[54:22] content for the world um really that
[54:25] that was the starting point for me and
[54:27] it it gives you an energy and it gives
[54:29] you fire that that you will not get
[54:32] anywhere else no matter what conference
[54:34] you go through maybe for some people as
[54:36] Salvador is a very far trip and it's a
[54:38] lot of cost involved I get that if you
[54:41] can afford it it's definitely worth it
[54:43] but if you go to Amsterdam or if you go
[54:45] to brag if you go to any conference I
[54:48] love that like if you haven't been to
[54:50] any conference go to at least one at the
[54:53] second one I don't have to sell you that
[54:55] because it will be such an amazing
[54:57] experience that you will be addicted to
[54:59] bitcoin conferences at least that's my
[55:01] experience so far and I'm really looking
[55:04] forward to to meeting you finally in
[55:06] person now we are on the second podcast
[55:09] together I'm also looking forward to to
[55:11] being uh part of the speaker I'm really
[55:13] honored that that you brought me up as a
[55:15] as a speaker also in the conference it
[55:17] will be really fun also uh yeah it will
[55:19] be I'm just like you you can see how
[55:21] it's flowing with me I'm I'm loving when
[55:24] I can connect people and when I can be
[55:26] with with bitcoiners and that's kind of
[55:28] my thing yeah this is the this is the
[55:30] opportunity H Robin I I couldn't agree
[55:33] with you more it opens doors that you
[55:35] never thought would have be available
[55:37] the the idea of Bitcoin is usually in
[55:39] your own head and online and there's no
[55:42] replacement for meeting people in the
[55:45] flesh and being able to exchange um you
[55:48] know this is the way this is the way
[55:50] forward uh getting together in person
[55:53] exchanging ideas exchanging knowledge uh
[55:56] hugs and you know experiences together
[55:59] as bitcoiners I think that is that is
[56:02] the best thing best thing possible I
[56:03] didn't include that we also have two
[56:05] workshops as well so we'll have you know
[56:08] two Workshop rooms with show and self-
[56:10] custody multi- different tools that you
[56:12] can use Hands-On approach in in terms of
[56:14] Bitcoin we have h two one hour classes
[56:19] in the morning for Spanish speakers just
[56:21] as an intro to bitcoin just so that they
[56:23] get familiar with Bitcoin and yeah uh
[56:27] well you've got like people who are
[56:29] extremely knowledgeable on the code as
[56:32] well who will be able to show you how to
[56:33] run a node and to be able to you know
[56:38] back back your back your Bitcoin up in
[56:41] the safest and most long-term way
[56:43] possible right so yeah it's it's it'll
[56:46] be an experience I'm really excited
[56:47] personally this has been a really good
[56:49] experience I can't wait to see you Robin
[56:51] I can't wait to see in person take your
[56:53] hand will be fun will be fun confor it
[56:57] absolutely um it's been a pleasure it's
[56:59] already one hour so we have endro in the
[57:01] podcast where we have two questions the
[57:03] first question is always the same for
[57:04] every guest and the second one is from
[57:06] the previous guest let's start off with
[57:09] the first question is always the same
[57:10] question for every guest what can we
[57:13] learn from you besides Bitcoin and all
[57:15] the things that we already talked about
[57:18] what haven't we talked about touched on
[57:19] a lot man um yeah I think en able I
[57:23] suppose m music essentially yeah I think
[57:26] yeah music I've you know I've gone
[57:29] through a period of mixing and putting
[57:32] on on on
[57:34] music uh I you know I think anybody
[57:38] who's into music and wants to come to El
[57:40] Salvador and bring their talents here
[57:43] it's it's all open we're building a a
[57:47] hostel down by the beach big hostel a
[57:50] group of Irish friends uh I've one of my
[57:53] best friends already living here and
[57:55] we're going to be building a a dance
[57:57] floor Parish bar Sports Gym a BJJ gym
[58:01] and stuff like that so if anybody has
[58:04] specialized in Brazilian jiujitsu or
[58:07] DJing or live music please reach out
[58:11] we're we're looking for all the talent
[58:13] in the world to come and bring it to El
[58:15] Salvador live here fulltime all the
[58:18] opportunity to do that so that's that's
[58:20] one aspect of of my life that we didn't
[58:22] talk really cool now I love that music
[58:26] it's amazing it's it's like uh in that
[58:28] part of the show people bring up either
[58:31] family or music or something completely
[58:34] unexpected and weird but that's usually
[58:37] the most fun part yeah I like that
[58:40] question a lot because sometimes it
[58:41] brings up completely something you we
[58:44] really cool other Andro you already
[58:46] familiar with that um we had it also
[58:48] with when you were the first time there
[58:50] where the previous guest is asking a
[58:51] question for the next guest without
[58:53] knowing who the next guest actually is
[58:54] the question for you is uh from a
[58:56] previous guest how do you think prices
[58:58] of goods and services will be different
[59:01] under a Bitcoin standard uh they'll
[59:03] constantly be dropping we will draw up
[59:07] where the employees will have
[59:10] to people who hire employees will have
[59:13] to ask employees to drop their wage
[59:16] rather than employees asking to increase
[59:18] their wage to to the
[59:20] owners
[59:22] um those things that are most
[59:24] reproducible will drop out a quicker
[59:26] rate so the things that you know that
[59:28] you
[59:29] can use Machinery to be able to
[59:31] reproduce much quicker are going to drop
[59:34] to close to zero much quicker and you
[59:37] know there there'll be premium on on
[59:39] scarce things I suppose we can already
[59:41] see that what's on land where price
[59:43] increases but uh the Bitcoin uh value of
[59:50] the scarcest items will remain the most
[59:52] stable and those things that are most
[59:55] reproducible
[59:57] will decrease the
[59:59] quickest of the most popular things will
[60:03] will end up bring in the most profits
[60:05] because they'll be the most sales so
[60:07] most profits means higher amount of
[60:08] investment meaning higher amount of
[60:11] production and they'll they'll drop in
[60:13] price as well so most popular things
[60:15] will end up being the cheapest things as
[60:17] well and if we all live by a Bitcoin
[60:22] standard and value high quality products
[60:25] that means that highest quality products
[60:26] are going to be the cheapest it's
[60:28] great interesting I love the perspective
[60:31] also the the Mind shift I just realized
[60:33] that last week actually someone brought
[60:35] it up to me and now you bring it up
[60:36] again the Mind shift of when you
[60:39] negotiate salary now you as an employe
[60:42] have to go to the employer every year or
[60:45] every half year to like negotiate a
[60:48] higher price now this level completely
[60:51] turns around where the employer has to
[60:54] go to the employee and say like
[60:56] we have to uh or we we would like to
[61:00] have a lower salary for you because the
[61:04] the cost is coming
[61:05] down that that is a power shift in in
[61:09] companies that's that's a fascinating
[61:11] thing that's one thing we talked about
[61:14] it before the show before we recorded
[61:16] with the podcast I've done a daily
[61:19] Bitcoin show and that's the thing never
[61:21] thought about and the first time I
[61:23] brought up like after 250 episodes of
[61:25] Bitcoin podcast after being four years
[61:27] in Bitcoin it's the first time ever I
[61:29] thought about that so it's h crazy uh
[61:32] how much uh and how deep and how wide
[61:35] the Bitcoin knowledge really goes and
[61:37] and how much you can dive deep into
[61:39] topics I think I barely scratched the
[61:41] surface and I'm really looking forward
[61:43] to the next years uh in diving even
[61:45] deeper with the podcast yeah so thank
[61:47] you so much uh Charlie for for being on
