[00:00] Bitcoin definitely supercharges your
[00:01] life how many plebs are just getting
[00:03] wrecked holding dog coins how many plebs
[00:06] are getting wrecked buying [ __ ] jpegs
[00:08] of monkeys Bitcoin is the Apex property
[00:10] it's appreciating at a faster rate than
[00:12] everything else in the marketplace and
[00:13] Satoshi paired infinite Demand with true
[00:15] scarcity where you have scarcity in a
[00:17] money you create abundance in goods and
[00:19] resources if Bitcoin goes to let's say a
[00:22] million usar in the next 12 months I
[00:24] think that Bitcoin inverses these issues
[00:27] you know all roads lead to
[00:28] bitcoin I also researched a little bit
[00:31] on your Twitter uh feed and I saw one of
[00:34] your first tweets where you like gave
[00:36] water to the first plants and you wrote
[00:39] something with stack SS and and growing
[00:41] something so where was this connection
[00:44] coming from and then then how did you
[00:45] get started with all that uh yeah I
[00:47] think you're referring to I probably
[00:49] said something like uh bagging pounds
[00:52] stacking SATs yeah something like that
[00:55] yeah and so the significance of that for
[00:57] me stems from stems from the reality as
[01:01] a commodity
[01:02] producer that we that I
[01:05] have
[01:08] downward price pressure on the commodity
[01:10] that I'm producing the commodity that I
[01:12] produce denominated in dollars is going
[01:15] down in value while my cost of living is
[01:19] going up denominated in dollars so I
[01:22] have dollar denominated wage deflation
[01:26] and I have dollar denominated increase
[01:29] inflation in my cost of living or cost
[01:31] of operating my
[01:33] business and so without sweeping my
[01:35] Surplus into a property that is holding
[01:40] its value better than the dollar then I
[01:43] have an existential crisis and Bitcoin
[01:46] is the Apex property it's appreciating
[01:48] at a faster rate than everything else in
[01:50] the marketplace so it is the Apex
[01:52] treasury Reserve asset so as a commodity
[01:56] producer producing a product that has
[01:59] traditionally had a large margin it's
[02:01] been very profitable to produce cannabis
[02:04] because of prohibition because you've
[02:06] had regulatory restriction on the
[02:08] production of cannabis it's created a
[02:10] large margin and as that margin has been
[02:13] attacked it's an economic incentive for
[02:15] entrepreneurs and capital to move into
[02:17] that sector of the marketplace and meet
[02:19] the demand with Supply which drives the
[02:23] value of that product down and we have
[02:26] that in every area of the marketplace
[02:28] it's just going to being varying degrees
[02:32] and so the deflationary force that's
[02:35] been taking place uh with Canabis has
[02:38] been quite Extreme as an example 10
[02:41] years ago a high quality pound of
[02:44] cannabis in the state of California bulk
[02:47] wholesaled for3 to 4,000 a
[02:51] pound and today that same pound honestly
[02:55] a better pound of cannabis is worth a
[02:57] th000 bucks and in that time my cost of
[03:01] living has doubled so I really make
[03:05] one6 per unit
[03:08] produced that I did 10 years ago and so
[03:11] how do you combat that you can combat
[03:13] that by scaling up but the act of doing
[03:17] so further exacerbates the problem and
[03:21] so without having a Bitcoin standard you
[03:24] can't produce a product that has a high
[03:26] marginal cost of
[03:28] production down to saturating like I so
[03:32] I I was talking about my wife about this
[03:34] last night I was explaining this to her
[03:35] she had some questions it's like the
[03:37] marketplace if you have demand in the
[03:39] marketplace for something it's like the
[03:40] marketplace is hungry for whatever that
[03:43] thing may be and by a satiating the
[03:46] market by meeting that Demand with
[03:49] Supply you're driving the value down so
[03:53] you're associating that economic
[03:55] incentive essentially and you're putting
[03:58] yourself in a position where you can't
[03:59] can't perpetually produce a surplus so
[04:03] what does that mean well that means that
[04:05] the Surplus that you do produce when you
[04:07] can produce it needs to be converted
[04:11] from a shitty form of money like Fiat
[04:13] dollars into a strong form of money or a
[04:17] strong property yeah so that's what I
[04:19] was referring to I would say generally
[04:22] out of that one little little tweet or
[04:25] hashtag stacking SATs or bagging pound
[04:27] stacking SATs it's um it's a fascinating
[04:31] topic because when you have full Bitcoin
[04:35] standard all the prices will
[04:37] fall totally all the house prices uh
[04:42] banana prices whatever like all the
[04:44] prices when you have a full sound money
[04:47] system uh we getting better in producing
[04:50] uh in your case like cannabis in in
[04:52] other places like phones or stuff like
[04:54] that no matter what you're looking at
[04:57] everything will get cheaper because we
[04:59] will get better better in producing it
[05:01] we will not get worse in producing
[05:02] something so all the Commodities all the
[05:04] prices will come down and I think you
[05:07] talked about it in your last video where
[05:10] like Bitcoin is super charging your life
[05:13] and there was like some line I don't
[05:14] even remember if it was in that line or
[05:16] the other in the other video of yours
[05:19] where you talked about um Bitcoin is
[05:21] driving down home prices and effectively
[05:26] killing or not killing like driving down
[05:28] homelessness for people because home
[05:31] prices are coming down like maybe let's
[05:33] talk about that like Bitcoin is super
[05:36] charging your life and
[05:38] supercharging um like the whole uh kind
[05:41] of world we're living in it yeah so the
[05:46] way I think about that starts from the
[05:50] savings technology right and so I
[05:52] consider myself to be on a Bitcoin
[05:55] standard however I have to use the
[05:58] intermediary the current currency so
[06:00] pre- Bitcoin people intuitively
[06:03] converted or moved out of the currency
[06:06] into a stronger form of property right
[06:10] that's the financial strategy for the
[06:12] last hundred years if you earned money
[06:14] or dollars you would then take that
[06:16] Surplus and you would typically put it
[06:19] into a diversified basket of assets
[06:21] Commodities equities bonds real estate
[06:25] and now that we have Bitcoin being the
[06:27] Apex property just because of the sheer
[06:31] properties of Bitcoin where you have
[06:33] this currently it's Supply is increasing
[06:37] at a slower rate than everything else in
[06:39] the marketplace that stock to flow but
[06:41] once we hit 21 million it's truly capped
[06:43] and if it's truly capped and it's a
[06:44] money then that means that we have
[06:47] infinite demand because everyone on
[06:49] planet Earth wants money whatever the
[06:51] money is people will want you know like
[06:54] breed love says because money is a call
[06:56] option on any other good or service that
[06:58] the marketplace produces so that being
[07:01] the case Bitcoin has infinite demand and
[07:04] Satoshi paired infinite Demand with true
[07:06] scarcity so now we have the Apex asset
[07:09] and so still operating within the dollar
[07:13] system the strategy is the same as as it
[07:15] was 100 years ago or 50 years ago or 20
[07:18] years ago you earn a surplus in dollars
[07:20] and you need to sweep those dollars into
[07:23] a asset that's losing its value slower
[07:28] well bitco coin being thermodynamically
[07:30] sound not being debased it's the Apex
[07:32] asset or Apex asset and so by adopting a
[07:37] Bitcoin standard or putting Bitcoin on
[07:39] your balance sheet or hling or saving in
[07:42] Bitcoin the appreciation that takes
[07:45] place is so great compared to its
[07:48] competitors that now you're hedged
[07:51] against the deflationary world and the
[07:53] deflationary forces and so yeah it does
[07:58] supercharge
[07:59] your life in this sense that it's kind
[08:02] of like it's it's a little bit it's the
[08:04] [ __ ] you money thing where you know I'm
[08:07] okay if the value of my product that I'm
[08:09] producing continues to go down and I'm
[08:12] okay with that because that's good for
[08:13] all of humanity let's say I don't
[08:15] produced cannabis let say I produced
[08:16] food cheaper food is good right more
[08:18] people have access to food well as a
[08:20] producer while my cost of living is
[08:22] going up in dollars and the value of the
[08:24] product that I produce is going down in
[08:26] dollars that creates this existential
[08:28] crisis
[08:30] but if I can save in Bitcoin now I don't
[08:33] have that crisis and so I denominate the
[08:35] things I want in the future in Bitcoin
[08:37] and like you said they're all going down
[08:39] when you denominate them in Bitcoin it's
[08:41] the exact
[08:43] inversion um I forget the second part of
[08:46] your question there so yeah so uh
[08:49] Bitcoin definitely supercharges your
[08:51] life and I would say that that stems
[08:53] from the balance sheet what what was the
[08:56] second part of your question the second
[08:57] part of the question was also with like
[08:59] the homelessness uh driving down home
[09:02] braisers and um basic supercharging uh
[09:06] like I see I I uh was intentionally
[09:09] doing my podcast in English I have my
[09:12] native uh language is German but I
[09:16] already saw a lot of German podcasters
[09:19] and German things to do also like
[09:22] there's a lot of English uh a lot of
[09:24] English podcasts also uh but the way I
[09:27] thought about it is um when I do it
[09:30] English I can talk with people outside
[09:32] of the German speaking area German
[09:34] speaking area is like Austria Germany
[09:37] Swiss so that's a really privileged
[09:41] group of people I would say right now
[09:43] and now I can also talk with African
[09:46] bitcoiners I can talk with all the
[09:49] bitcoiners around the world and it's so
[09:51] different how people in India Africa
[09:53] Australia America Europe Canada um think
[09:57] about Bitcoin
[09:59] and so I think it's it's it's really
[10:03] interesting when you see okay how is
[10:06] Bitcoin good for different kinds of
[10:08] people and obviously when you talk with
[10:10] a businessman it's like oh I want to not
[10:13] lose all my profits while I'm saving
[10:15] things then there are people that are in
[10:18] oppressed countries where they're like I
[10:20] want to um fund the opposite party of my
[10:24] political uh view I want to fund people
[10:27] that are outside uh of the government so
[10:29] we can maybe have more democracy and we
[10:32] saw it I think it was Russia this
[10:35] example where uh the opposite party of
[10:37] Vladimir Putin Got U um money with
[10:41] Bitcoin because otherwise they were
[10:44] turned down um there's a lot of examples
[10:47] how Bitcoins can supercharge different
[10:50] people in different
[10:52] areas yes yeah so I think in the states
[10:56] we have a housing crisis Black Rock and
[11:00] other funds have been buying houses uh
[11:03] wealthy generally speaking wealthy
[11:05] people or people who have produced
[11:07] enough of an economic surplus especially
[11:10] for the last 50 years have been
[11:12] incentivized through the way our
[11:14] monetary system works uh to buy real
[11:17] estate you get to put 5% 10% down the
[11:21] bank will then loan you the money to go
[11:23] buy the house and then you can get yield
[11:25] on that house by renting it to somebody
[11:27] who is not capable of buying a house
[11:29] and as the currency debases the value of
[11:32] the house denominated that currency goes
[11:34] up and it has to actually because the
[11:36] monetary units are lent into existence
[11:39] as debt against these assets and so it
[11:41] creates a feedback loop where if you buy
[11:43] a house and you rent it out and it's an
[11:45] investment or you're really just using
[11:47] it as a savings instrument as it
[11:50] appreciates in value you're incentivized
[11:52] to pull that Equity out and go buy more
[11:54] houses so you have a the canona feedback
[11:58] loop well what's happening and this is
[12:01] thanks to Jeff Booth providing Clarity
[12:03] to this and in his work it's been
[12:06] pivotal in my understanding what's
[12:08] happening with cars and we can all see
[12:10] it you go buy a $50,000 car and a year
[12:13] later it's worth
[12:15] $30,000 the same thing is happening with
[12:17] houses it's just hard to see because the
[12:21] dollar that we denominate the value of
[12:23] the house in is losing value faster than
[12:27] the house is losing value
[12:30] and so really without a economic
[12:34] instrument that is more scarce than
[12:37] housing houses appreciate on average at
[12:40] a faster rate than most other things in
[12:42] the marketplace also because they have
[12:44] to continue to debase to keep that
[12:46] housing price
[12:47] up so for selfish purposes if you want
[12:51] to earn the most return on an asset over
[12:55] time you need something that is the most
[12:57] scarce asset right and that's obviously
[13:00] Bitcoin and in addition to that
[13:02] bitcoin's invisible it's metaphysical
[13:05] and I think one of the very the most
[13:07] beautiful things about this is we have
[13:09] this in in this desire to gather up or
[13:12] procure as much resources as we can
[13:15] we're like squirrels going through the
[13:17] the metaphorical Forest Gathering nuts
[13:20] and if you can get enough nuts to
[13:21] survive a winter you're not going to
[13:24] stop you're going to keep Gathering nuts
[13:26] right you want to save as much energy as
[13:28] you can to hedge yourself against future
[13:31] uncertainty or to like endow your
[13:33] children with financial means or give
[13:36] them resources or to fund some Endeavor
[13:38] some capitalist Endeavor I'm going to
[13:40] save this capital and I'm going to
[13:41] deploy it into the future and so now
[13:43] that we have this invisible instrument
[13:46] that we can hoard that is more scarce
[13:49] than all of the physical resources in
[13:52] our world the incentive is to hoard the
[13:54] invisible thing freeing up all these
[13:56] physical things and going back to
[13:59] housing as an example I was one of the
[14:02] first licensed cannabis producers in the
[14:04] state of California in 2018 when
[14:06] California fully legalized cannabis for
[14:09] recreational use they implemented
[14:12] Licensing in a regulatory framework and
[14:15] I received one of the first licenses and
[14:17] in that two-year journey of owning that
[14:19] business and that property I concluded
[14:21] through a myriad of political and
[14:25] commoditization and jurisdictional risk
[14:27] there's a lot of risk involved in that I
[14:29] decided to sell the property sell the
[14:31] business and pivot my business
[14:34] model and at that time you know in 2017
[14:39] is when I was introduced to bitcoin
[14:41] while I owned this property it was also
[14:43] part of what was a catalyst for me to
[14:45] determine that I needed to sell this
[14:47] property because I didn't think it was
[14:48] that great of a long-term
[14:50] investment and in selling the property I
[14:53] moved into a rental and I have since
[14:55] then decided that I want to live in a
[14:58] rental and I don't want to buy a house
[14:59] and I don't actually want to not only do
[15:01] I not want to buy houses as an
[15:03] investment or as a savings strategy I
[15:08] don't want to buy a house to live in
[15:10] because I think it's a poor use of money
[15:12] currently while there's so many people
[15:14] who still think that it's a great
[15:16] investment in relative to owning no
[15:19] property owning a house is better than
[15:21] owning no property because the supply of
[15:23] houses is inflating at a slower rate
[15:26] than the supply of dollars is inflating
[15:29] but I personally believe that for the
[15:32] foreseeable while while Bitcoin
[15:36] demonetizes all of the monetary energy
[15:38] held up in all these asset classes
[15:40] globally whatever the dollar denominated
[15:43] value of a home is that 10% or 5% down
[15:49] payment instead of allocated to a house
[15:53] now also you're taking on the debt if
[15:55] you allocated that and and once again
[15:58] the dollar amounts don't matter the
[16:00] dollar amount of Bitcoin and the dollar
[16:02] amount of the house at this point in my
[16:04] rough thesis in estimation doesn't
[16:07] matter if you take a house you take the
[16:09] 10% down payment and you allocate that
[16:11] to bitcoin as opposed to the home and
[16:14] you rent I believe that for the
[16:16] foreseeable while you will get wealthier
[16:20] on the appreciation taking place in the
[16:22] Bitcoin after you deduct your rental
[16:26] costs so as far as a pure selfish
[16:29] Financial strategy how do I come up the
[16:32] hardest if you will right how do I make
[16:34] the most yielder return with my
[16:37] investment not buying the house is going
[16:40] to return the most and then in addition
[16:42] to that it's the ethical investment
[16:44] because if I don't if I'm not going to
[16:47] bid on a house to purchase that house
[16:50] that's
[16:51] less demand for homes less demand for
[16:55] homes means that's downward price
[16:57] pressure on homes and so if I'm not a
[17:00] killionaire borrowing Equity against my
[17:03] houses to go buy more houses I'm not in
[17:06] a position where I'm competing for a
[17:08] house against a first-time home buyer as
[17:09] an example and long term that's going to
[17:13] put downward price pressure on houses
[17:14] houses will fall to their utility value
[17:17] currently we have this blurry thing
[17:20] taking place where we don't really know
[17:21] what a house is worth denominated in
[17:23] dollars because it's being treated the
[17:26] real estate market generally is a
[17:28] savings account for productive or just
[17:31] wealthy people who have earned a surplus
[17:33] and it's also a utility asset that or
[17:37] instrument that people need to live in
[17:39] and so yeah it's really exciting that we
[17:44] can Sav in this invisible metaphysical
[17:47] instrument and we can hoard this thing
[17:50] which I don't think you'll ever be able
[17:51] to stifle people's desire to procure the
[17:54] most right that that insatiable need to
[17:57] just get as much as you you can well by
[17:59] hoarding this invisible thing it's it's
[18:02] like uh Jeff boo says where you have
[18:04] abundance in money whatever the money is
[18:07] you create scarcity in goods and
[18:08] resources because nobody wants to hold
[18:09] the money because it's really abundant
[18:11] it's starting to lose its value more
[18:13] abundant it is the more you know the
[18:15] less it's worth and where you have
[18:18] scarcity in a money you create abundance
[18:21] in goods and
[18:22] resources so I believe that by just the
[18:25] sheer existence of Bitcoin and the fact
[18:27] that it's the hardest asset within the
[18:29] marketplace you're incentivized to get
[18:32] the most to hold the Bitcoin and not
[18:34] hold the real estate and in addition to
[18:36] that and lastly I believe that through
[18:39] the vortex of incentives the financial
[18:42] institutions are going to start loaning
[18:44] dollars against Bitcoin because it's
[18:47] much better collateral than a home is if
[18:49] you default if like for example I'm a
[18:51] northern California in a small area if I
[18:54] owned real estate and for whatever
[18:57] reason I default on the loan to the bank
[19:00] the the title holding entity and they
[19:04] have to foreclose on me and sell that
[19:06] asset into the marketplace to get their
[19:08] money back they can only sell that asset
[19:11] to whoever wants that house you know
[19:14] there might be 20 people who want that
[19:16] house 10 of which are capable of buying
[19:18] it well if you default on a loan against
[19:20] Bitcoin you can sell the Bitcoin 247 365
[19:23] to anybody on planet
[19:25] Earth so I think in addition okay I'll
[19:29] say this I'll leave this leave this
[19:30] thought here because uh the Fiat system
[19:33] has to continue to debase they have to
[19:36] continue to inject liquidity into the
[19:39] market they have to continue to create
[19:40] monetary units and lend them into the
[19:42] market if they continue to do so with
[19:44] housing people are going to go crazy
[19:46] housing prices become too much landlords
[19:49] have to raise rent so they can they can
[19:52] pay their mortgages people are going to
[19:54] lose their minds they can't do that well
[19:56] I also believe that Bitcoin is a really
[19:58] good place for the monetary debasement
[20:01] the inflation to go and not affect the
[20:05] cost of things that people need to
[20:07] live so I think that's a very exciting
[20:10] thing
[20:12] yeah there are so many things in there
[20:14] to to talk about in in in those in those
[20:17] sentences um let's start with that if
[20:20] you have uh the incentive to hold
[20:23] Bitcoin instead of physical things as
[20:25] you said with the example of a house
[20:27] with the example of almost everything
[20:29] because when you see oh Bitcoin is that
[20:32] invisible thing that I can hold and
[20:34] appreciates in value and is uh not not
[20:38] only good for my financial power but
[20:40] also for my freedom I can go with it uh
[20:42] do every border I can do so many things
[20:45] with it with it uh and then you have
[20:49] physical stuff like houses cars
[20:52] computers everything that is
[20:55] nonproductive and it's like a physical
[20:57] burden to have have it but then
[21:00] everything gets uh limited to all the
[21:04] utility like you only have like uh one
[21:06] car that you really need to drive from A
[21:09] to B because you know I rather get the
[21:12] more a little bit more Bitcoin with it
[21:15] uh than getting another car I rather get
[21:18] uh Bitcoin than another house or
[21:21] something like that is Bitcoin then
[21:24] incentivizing in a broader scale
[21:27] minimalism and having only the things
[21:30] you really need and the things you
[21:32] really value in life yeah it's I would
[21:35] say it's incentivizing minimalism or
[21:37] more so just uh Prudence pragmatism
[21:40] rationalism you know you're just you
[21:44] going to
[21:45] consume you're going to procure from the
[21:49] marketplace only what you
[21:51] need and you know there is this
[21:55] Keynesian modern monetary Theory
[21:58] lie and that is that if you need to in
[22:01] order to keep the velocity up within the
[22:04] money in the marketplace keep the money
[22:06] changing hands that you have to slowly
[22:08] inflate the supply it has to slowly lose
[22:11] purchasing power otherwise if the money
[22:13] is truly scarce people will hoard the
[22:15] money and the whole economy will
[22:16] collapse well the whole keyy and lie
[22:18] will collapse because it's a debt-based
[22:20] Fiat monetary slave system where the
[22:22] monetary units are being created and
[22:23] lent into existence as Deb against
[22:25] assets within the marketplace but the
[22:27] reality ity is is that people will
[22:29] always procure from the marketplace what
[22:32] they need to live and if we can create
[22:35] when we in Satoshi has scarcity and
[22:38] money it does incentivize in the highest
[22:41] way prudence and only taking what you
[22:43] need and not plundering and pillaging
[22:46] and just hoarding and and getting
[22:48] everything that you possibly can you
[22:50] know as an example the last thing that I
[22:54] converted uh that had economic energy
[22:57] lock up in it or stored in it was a
[23:00] truck I am I'm married I got a kid I got
[23:03] you know another kid on the way is the
[23:04] plan and she has a vehicle I have a
[23:07] vehicle and I had an a a extra vehicle
[23:11] there a Toyota Tacoma four-wheel drive
[23:14] truck I bought new I've had for years
[23:16] pristine condition I had a lot of
[23:19] emotional investment in this
[23:21] vehicle and I hemmed in hot about it for
[23:23] a little bit but as of like a year ago I
[23:25] just real I got to sell this this
[23:27] vehicle I have equity in it I need to
[23:29] put the equity into Bitcoin this vehicle
[23:31] is dilutive of my life force of my
[23:34] energy of my bandwidth of my mental Ram
[23:36] you know I have to register it I got to
[23:38] wash it I got to make sure it's not rot
[23:40] and every once in a while I got to drive
[23:41] it to keep it good and so that's a great
[23:44] example of what I think more and more
[23:46] people are going to do the fact that I
[23:48] sold that vehicle into the marketplace
[23:52] even if it's like one 10 millionth it's
[23:55] downward price pressure because it's one
[23:57] less individual who wants to hold on to
[24:00] a physical good that other people may
[24:05] need to live their life with and instead
[24:07] of hoarding it I'd rather have the
[24:09] Bitcoin so by selling off all of my
[24:11] extra stuff that's downward price
[24:13] pressure on everything it's upward price
[24:15] pressure on bitcoin further creating the
[24:17] feedback loop you know it's like sailor
[24:19] is all your models are destroyed well
[24:22] Bitcoin is breaking all of these broken
[24:26] strategies and it's definitely
[24:29] incentivizing in the highest way
[24:31] prudence and responsible I don't know
[24:34] use of resources and
[24:37] energy I think about that a lot if if
[24:40] Bitcoin uh sucks up all the financial
[24:43] energy and if people realize that with
[24:46] all the content out there there are so
[24:48] many podcast articles well articulated
[24:51] ways of saying Bitcoin is the thing and
[24:55] uh don't invest in bit in in in in uh
[24:59] fat currencies don't invest in Golds
[25:00] stuff like that like there are really a
[25:02] lot of informations out there exactly in
[25:04] that direction uh and if people realize
[25:08] it more and more and see it more and
[25:10] more because of number go up technology
[25:13] because of Freedom go up technology can
[25:14] it be dangerous if this is a crazy
[25:17] question can it be dangerous if Bitcoin
[25:19] goes up too fast uh I think about that
[25:23] and a few things come to mind Samson
[25:26] Ma's recent tweet about how he's says
[25:29] it's possible and he's slightly
[25:31] concerned that Bitcoin rips to a million
[25:34] dollars which from where we're currently
[25:36] at is a 20x Bitcoin has done a 20x in a
[25:39] 12 month period of time and I went to
[25:42] Pacific Bitcoin in October last year uh
[25:46] and I was chatting with Matt Crowder who
[25:49] I really appreciate his work is been
[25:52] quite pivotal in me you know learning
[25:54] and understanding about Bitcoin and we
[25:56] were talking about that and he kind of
[25:59] spoke to how he does think that it's
[26:01] problematic if it rips too fast um Sor
[26:06] in a podcast has you know talked about
[26:08] the sound barrier and you can't go too
[26:11] fast if Bitcoin goes too fast you don't
[26:13] want it to go too fast it'll shred
[26:16] reality and so I think that there's a
[26:18] lot of Truth to that however I believe
[26:21] that the economic incentive is such and
[26:25] so strong that I don't think that
[26:28] there's any way to slow it down um and I
[26:32] do think that there is some challenges
[26:36] if the price rips too fast I think some
[26:38] of the challenges kind of going back to
[26:41] Samson's tweet he kind of talks about it
[26:43] gives a list of I think eight things or
[26:45] 10 things where it's like if it rips to
[26:48] a million bucks or even a couple hundred
[26:49] thousand dollars let's say over the next
[26:51] six months it'll create a lot of pain
[26:54] within certain areas you'll have
[26:55] stranded utx o sets a lot of plebs that
[26:58] have been buying $100 worth of coins and
[27:00] sending them to Cold Storage the fees
[27:03] might be too high to to move those utxo
[27:06] sets there's a lot of Nations States who
[27:08] haven't figured out how to take on a
[27:10] position and adopt it as a treasury
[27:12] reserve and put on the balance sheet you
[27:15] know I don't know he went down a list
[27:16] sailor won't be able to get to 1% you
[27:19] know I forget the rest of them but yeah
[27:22] uh and so I do think that that's an
[27:24] issue however I don't know if it matters
[27:27] and this is why and maybe this is a
[27:28] little controversial but I do speak to
[27:30] this at times because I hear a lot of
[27:32] people talk about how Bitcoin needs to
[27:33] be a ground up movement and it's going
[27:34] to liberate all of humanity out of
[27:36] poverty and I think it will as long as
[27:39] it exists it will the question is is
[27:42] what's the time frame and so I do think
[27:46] that it's possible actually probable
[27:49] that there's been a mass scop taking
[27:50] place there's only one way to dilute
[27:53] Bitcoin and that's to allow the
[27:55] existence of all of these alternative
[27:57] altcoins like Gary gendler could come
[27:59] out tomorrow and say hey these are all
[28:00] unregistered Securities if you read all
[28:02] the fine print this is what he is saying
[28:04] but he hasn't publicly said they're all
[28:07] on registered Securities and we're going
[28:08] to sue every single one of them and I
[28:10] don't give a [ __ ] if it takes the United
[28:11] States government a [ __ ] Thousand
[28:13] Years we're going to shut them all down
[28:15] they would all crash tomorrow and that
[28:17] economic energy would leave these alts
[28:19] and it would go right into Bitcoin well
[28:21] then what happens the price rips what
[28:24] happens if you know a nation state
[28:27] public publicly announces hey we're
[28:28] buying all this Bitcoin the price is
[28:30] going to rip it legitimizes it Jamie
[28:33] Diamond apparently wakes up every
[28:34] morning and it's I could be wrong about
[28:36] this I'm drawing deep but I feel like
[28:38] I've heard somebody say like this this
[28:40] man reads for like a notable amount of
[28:42] time every day every morning it's like
[28:44] part of his routine this is the CEO of
[28:47] JP Morgan Chase he's on mainstream media
[28:51] and he's botching satoshi's name he says
[28:54] oh satachi oh satachi could come back
[28:57] and double the supply do you think JP
[29:00] the CEO of JP Morgan Chase doesn't
[29:03] understand what you and I could grasp
[29:06] and wrap our minds around in the very
[29:08] first 30 minutes we ever talked about
[29:11] Bitcoin I believe this guy understands
[29:14] Bitcoin very very well but by allowing
[29:18] all of this nonsense it is dilutive of
[29:21] the price how many plebs are just
[29:23] getting wrecked holding dog coins how
[29:25] many [ __ ] plebs are getting wrecked
[29:27] holding buying [ __ ] jpegs of monkeys
[29:31] right well it's very clear and if you
[29:33] listen to sailor that the government is
[29:36] gonna have to either change their laws
[29:38] which is not probable or they're going
[29:40] to shut all these unregistered
[29:42] Securities down and everyone's going to
[29:44] plow into Bitcoin and so I do think that
[29:47] you have big money taking a significant
[29:50] position behind the scenes and I do
[29:53] think that at some point we are going to
[29:54] wake up and the we're going to have that
[29:56] God candle 10 10 grand or there's going
[29:58] to be $10,000 Wicks a day or it's going
[30:00] to go from 500,000 to 550,000 and so
[30:04] circling back I think that the problem
[30:06] with that is is that and generally
[30:09] speaking I believe that the community
[30:11] thinks the problem with that is is that
[30:12] a bunch of plebs bunch of the peasant
[30:15] class which I am 100% plebian total
[30:18] peasant here no Overlord blood in my
[30:20] blood you know in this body I'm a I'm a
[30:23] pleb did we miss the boat well if
[30:27] Bitcoin exists it will always
[30:30] probabilistically speaking appreciate at
[30:32] a faster rate than everything else in
[30:34] the marketplace so it will always be the
[30:37] ticket out of having nothing to having
[30:40] something even if there is a fiat
[30:42] currency so whether Bitcoin is a million
[30:44] dollars a coin or it's $1 million a coin
[30:48] it doesn't really matter if you're
[30:49] buying an asset that appreciates at a
[30:52] faster rate than all the other assets
[30:55] and from a diabolical over overloading
[30:58] perspective if I'm a Central Banking
[31:00] Elite and I want to protect my hemony or
[31:03] my power over the market if you will
[31:07] then I would allow for a bunch of
[31:09] nonsense like all this [ __ ] coining and
[31:11] I would buy myself time because it's the
[31:13] only way to dilute this thing or to slow
[31:14] it down and then I would allow all my
[31:17] homies and cronies and sociopathic
[31:19] overlords and members of the WF and
[31:23] whatever Central Banking Bloodlines to
[31:25] secretly acquire position while people
[31:28] are buying dog coins and then at some
[31:32] point it becomes something that you
[31:34] can't avoid and the price rips well if
[31:37] that happens if Bitcoin goes to let's
[31:39] say a million doll US dollars in the
[31:41] next 12 months and then Gary gendler
[31:44] says hey actually we're going to shut
[31:45] these unregistered Securities down and
[31:48] then JP Morgan Chase says actually we'll
[31:50] loan you money against your
[31:53] Bitcoin then it legitimizes it and now
[31:56] you got the the plebian class the
[31:58] peasant class you know 99% of the
[32:01] population on planet Earth is going to
[32:03] be like Oh I'm going to go ahead and buy
[32:04] Bitcoin well how many people developed a
[32:07] significant Bitcoin position before that
[32:11] potential time in history right I don't
[32:14] know hundreds of thousands couple
[32:15] million people so if you're an Overlord
[32:18] in class you now have a small group of
[32:22] people who have an immense amount of
[32:23] economic energy that can push back
[32:25] against you versus what people I think
[32:28] hardcore bitcoiners within the community
[32:30] would like to see and unfortunately I
[32:32] don't think it's probabilistic but
[32:33] however I don't think it matters they
[32:35] would like to see people you know four
[32:37] billion people be ejected from poverty
[32:41] in hyper rates and I just don't think
[32:43] that that's probabilistic I think what's
[32:45] more probabilistic is is that the smart
[32:48] people who figured it out took a
[32:50] position you could say I just not even
[32:53] necessarily people who are smart just
[32:54] people who are primed or in a position
[32:57] where they were
[32:58] predisposed uh you could say to
[33:01] understanding it and adopting a position
[33:02] they develop a
[33:04] position and then the people who really
[33:06] have economic energy in their possession
[33:10] already are the most incentivized to
[33:11] figure out how to buy Bitcoin because
[33:13] otherwise they lose stuff and there are
[33:15] a lot of wealthy people in our world
[33:17] that became wealthy Pro through
[33:20] providing immense value to the
[33:23] marketplace and so they deserved to earn
[33:25] their wealth
[33:27] however the mmt this Fiat mechanism this
[33:32] Fiat technology that we have is paying
[33:35] the ownership class just to own things
[33:38] and that's the mechanism that needs to
[33:39] be broken because if you're earning a
[33:42] surplus you deserve to have that Surplus
[33:44] if you earned it ethically through the
[33:46] marketplace right and
[33:48] so I think that there is
[33:51] um you know like the aoc's of the world
[33:55] want to see a redistribution of we
[33:56] wealth because they're really bothered
[33:58] by all the wealthy people who have an
[33:59] unfair Advantage well that in my
[34:01] perspective and opinion the advantage
[34:04] that they have is is that they have
[34:06] appreciation on the stuff that they own
[34:09] taking place as a result of doing
[34:12] nothing other than owning it in addition
[34:15] to that they can leverage through debt
[34:18] that appreciation which is not taxed to
[34:22] go buy more assets and the peasant class
[34:25] is losing their [ __ ] mind over this
[34:27] right and people don't quite understand
[34:30] how to solve the problem and in my
[34:32] humble opinion you can never tax that
[34:36] issue away because you're decentivize
[34:38] people from going into the market and
[34:41] providing value to earn that money and
[34:45] Bitcoin is the de the redistribution of
[34:48] wealth that a lot of the people who are
[34:51] suffering in the world want to see and I
[34:54] feel like more people figure that out
[34:56] every day
[34:57] and lastly I'll say that over
[35:01] time the productive and ethical
[35:03] participants within the marketplace and
[35:05] I don't know if this is 20 years or a
[35:09] thousand years will be the ones who end
[35:11] up with the coins they will be the ones
[35:13] who end up with the coins because you
[35:15] can't rape and pillage in perpetuity
[35:17] without having some sort of mechanism
[35:20] funding that and the raping and the
[35:22] pillaging currently in our world is
[35:24] funded through Fiat the Bas I'm super
[35:28] excited to announce that this podcast
[35:30] got the first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is
[35:35] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[35:38] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[35:41] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[35:44] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[35:46] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[35:49] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[35:52] support this podcast use code Robin and
[35:55] click the link in the description
[35:56] description it's um I think one of my
[35:59] first tweets actually went really well
[36:02] on on on Twitter um that I make like a
[36:05] longer one where I described how the
[36:08] fear world is basically proof of stake
[36:11] as we see it in a lot of Al coins where
[36:14] when once you get rich once you have it
[36:17] you get even more like this com
[36:19] completely effect of like you have it
[36:21] and you get more through just rent
[36:23] seeking basically uh the proof of work
[36:26] concept is such a beautiful one because
[36:28] it uh incentivizes everyone to be
[36:31] productive and good for society to get a
[36:35] surplus and if everyone is productive
[36:38] and uh everyone that is productive gets
[36:41] rewarded the most we having a fair
[36:44] Society where uh good people get uh
[36:47] rewarded naturally without having some
[36:51] policy from some political politicial
[36:54] class uh forced onto them and that's an
[36:57] amazing thing that uh that is happening
[37:00] with Bitcoin I I want to see that future
[37:03] right as sooner than later uh but I
[37:06] think we have to wait a little bit
[37:07] longer to have it on on a full scale um
[37:12] but uh in general like even if we are
[37:14] thinking about government I saw that the
[37:16] other day a video where someone said
[37:19] like oh a few hundred uh years ago we
[37:22] did not had to ask the government to uh
[37:25] if if if we can
[37:27] have a company or if we can build that
[37:29] house here and stuff like that and it
[37:31] seems like uh governments and the
[37:34] overreaching um facilities want to have
[37:37] more and more to say about what we do
[37:40] like even small transactions try to uh
[37:43] VI 10,000 Euros across Europe without
[37:47] having anyone to to question about where
[37:50] the funds coming I even make that
[37:52] example the first time I bought Bitcoin
[37:54] I bought with a shitty German exchange
[37:56] where they asked me where my funds are
[37:57] coming they wanted to see like salary
[38:00] stuff from me and like where's this
[38:01] money coming from and it was not a lot
[38:03] it was not like I deployed Millions it
[38:05] was like in the it was really not a lot
[38:09] so um how do you see the political
[38:13] systems the government systems uh all
[38:15] the systems that are now in place that
[38:17] are kind of fear funded and uh geared
[38:22] towards War even um changing on a
[38:26] Bitcoin
[38:27] sound money standard where everybody has
[38:30] to work for something to
[38:33] get
[38:35] well first off I think that the proof of
[38:41] stake Dynamic within Fiat causes people
[38:44] to self dilute and become sociopathic
[38:48] some people something breaks within them
[38:51] where life is so challenging where they
[38:55] justify a win win lose business strategy
[38:58] within the marketplace so that they can
[39:00] have enough ownership to then get paid
[39:04] and keep getting paid because they own
[39:06] things and I think that that's immensely
[39:09] problematic um in addition to the
[39:11] incentive to violence with physical
[39:15] stuff right if if I just am I I'm a
[39:18] sociopath and I don't give a [ __ ] for
[39:20] all of known time the path of least
[39:23] resistance for me to get something is
[39:24] just kill the person who it and take it
[39:27] or to develop some sort of some
[39:30] construct where I'm going to slowly
[39:32] extract that through people and I think
[39:33] that that's the world we live in today
[39:36] and as far as the political apparatus
[39:40] generally speaking within the world
[39:43] today I think It suffers
[39:47] tremendously because of the two opposing
[39:49] forces that affect me in my life and I
[39:52] the way I see it it affects everybody
[39:54] deflationary world we live in a
[39:57] deflationary world where you have a
[39:59] large margin that means there's a large
[40:01] demand for something in the marketplace
[40:04] and that's a large economic incentive to
[40:07] go into that sector and meet that Demand
[40:09] with Supply driving the price down but
[40:11] as our cost of living is going up
[40:13] denominated in that currency it's two
[40:15] opposing forces and so I have that issue
[40:18] you have that issue everyone has that
[40:20] issue the individuals the small
[40:22] businesses the large corporations the
[40:24] nation states they all we all have this
[40:26] problem and so the nation state and the
[40:28] political
[40:30] apparatus independently and collectively
[40:33] having that problem I think what they're
[40:36] doing with regulation is is essentially
[40:39] trying to build regulatory modes around
[40:43] certain things within the marketplace to
[40:46] allow them to perpetually pull the
[40:49] margin out of the marketplace that they
[40:51] need to operate the only way to keep the
[40:54] price up on something that the world
[40:57] wants is to monopolize it through
[41:00] regulatory efforts as an example the
[41:03] first thing that comes to mind in the
[41:05] states is and we have a huge health
[41:07] problem here in the United States as a
[41:09] result of Fiat and Fiat foods but it's
[41:12] insulin it's my understanding and I
[41:15] could be wrong about the specifics here
[41:18] I'm just a pleb trying to figure it out
[41:20] in the world like anybody else is but
[41:22] it's my understanding that two companies
[41:24] in the states two large corporations
[41:27] pharmaceutical corporations hold the
[41:29] patent or access to the rights to
[41:32] produce
[41:33] insulin so insulin is extremely
[41:37] expensive and very profitable and in a
[41:40] free
[41:41] market the economic incentive to produce
[41:44] insulin is so high that people would
[41:46] start starting they would start insulin
[41:48] businesses if you had the ability to
[41:51] just go to your local jurisdiction and
[41:52] apply for a business license to produce
[41:55] insulin and then the Regulators let's
[41:56] say for example they put in some testing
[41:58] standard hey you can produce insulin it
[42:00] needs to be in a FDA approved kitchen or
[42:04] laboratory couple million bucks it's not
[42:07] billions to build a little facility
[42:09] couple million dollars build a facility
[42:10] now you can produce insulin you have to
[42:12] send it to this government approved
[42:14] laboratory to make sure it's clean it's
[42:15] not made in a bathtub in an apartment
[42:18] somewhere well the AC of doing so would
[42:21] be Supply meeting demand which would
[42:24] drive the price down eventually to its
[42:27] marginal cost of production and now
[42:29] there's no margin left and so the only
[42:31] way to protect the margin is through
[42:34] regulatory modes and in a world where we
[42:37] have these deflationary forces as an
[42:40] individual or as a nation state the
[42:42] margin is harder to capture and the cost
[42:45] of operating is going up you know I
[42:47] think of the United States as a great
[42:49] example has this fundamental Monumental
[42:52] catch22 the more that they print SLB the
[42:57] base the more that they need to do so
[43:00] because on an annual basis the cost of
[43:02] operating for that construct that
[43:05] apparatus the nation state the US
[43:06] government their cost of operating goes
[43:09] up every year further because they keep
[43:12] debasing the currency so I think there's
[43:14] two things taking place further
[43:16] debasement and then putting in
[43:19] regulations to PE stop people from
[43:21] losing their [ __ ] minds and then also
[43:24] trying to figure out how to build
[43:25] regulatory remotes through co-opting the
[43:28] political apparatus so that you and your
[43:31] business entities or cronies or whatever
[43:34] can protect that margin and so I think
[43:38] if an individual a small business large
[43:42] business Corporation and nation state as
[43:45] they adopt Bitcoin as a treasury Reserve
[43:48] asset there's less of an incentive to
[43:52] figure out how to grab and extract
[43:55] perpetually more out of the marketplace
[43:57] as it becomes exponentially harder to
[44:01] do so for me as an example as my
[44:05] cost of living is increasing denominated
[44:08] in dollars my cost of living is
[44:09] decreasing denominated in Bitcoin the
[44:12] cost of my product is decreasing
[44:15] denominated in dollars it's also
[44:17] decreasing denominated in Bitcoin but my
[44:20] cost of living denominated in Bitcoin
[44:22] decreases faster than my co the cost of
[44:26] the product that I produce denominated
[44:28] in Bitcoin so I
[44:30] have wage deflation but I have a higher
[44:35] cost of operating cost of living
[44:37] deflation and I do believe that the
[44:39] incentive Vortex is fundamentally so
[44:43] strong that I don't think we need to do
[44:46] a whole lot of worrying or or exert an
[44:51] enormous amount of energy to attempt to
[44:53] orange pill the government as an example
[44:55] I think that I think that we have we've
[44:58] hit escape velocity the game theory is
[45:01] in effect and I think that the most
[45:03] logical reasonable outcome is going to
[45:05] be the most probable outcome and that
[45:07] that is every large corporation is going
[45:09] to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[45:11] because it's a better Financial strategy
[45:13] than going and consolidating buying back
[45:16] your own shares or buying a smaller
[45:18] business entity right the government is
[45:21] going to be incentivized to put Bitcoin
[45:23] on the balance sheet because it's a
[45:25] better strategy
[45:26] and now governments are doing it and so
[45:30] and sailors doing it dude if Apple
[45:32] Netflix Amazon Nestle all the Fiat
[45:36] scummy food corporations Monsanto be
[45:39] chemical science all of these despicable
[45:42] entities who really I believe have
[45:44] become despicable through their behavior
[45:46] because of this fundamental issue it's
[45:49] exponentially harder to extract profits
[45:51] out of the marketplace so they have to
[45:53] exponentially [ __ ] ify everything to
[45:56] keep that margin well the incentive is
[45:58] now to buy the Bitcoin and if they don't
[46:01] micro strategy will own all of the
[46:04] [ __ ] world they literally just start
[46:06] buying up all of these corporations
[46:08] because they can't keep up and as a
[46:10] matter of fact I already have you know I
[46:12] was talk with a buddy about this it's
[46:14] gonna be really interesting to see in 10
[46:15] years where does Micro strategy land
[46:19] where does it reside within the
[46:20] corporate world relative to Microsoft or
[46:24] apple or amaz
[46:26] on they took on a Bitcoin position first
[46:30] they're going to be better off and so
[46:32] yeah I think that Bitcoin in in in it
[46:35] inverses these issues you know all roads
[46:38] lead to bitcoin that's what I think it's
[46:41] interesting to see when like we seeing
[46:44] micro strategy almost having hitting
[46:46] that 1% goal of like having 1% of the
[46:49] Bitcoin Supply uh seeing also like even
[46:53] you and me like talking so publicly
[46:55] about Bitcoin uh and seeing like in 10
[47:00] years time 20 years time 50 years time
[47:03] when everything that we're now talking
[47:05] about
[47:07] in in maybe a different order maybe in a
[47:09] different scale maybe in a different uh
[47:12] way but everything uh is coming as we
[47:17] kind of saw it what will happen to like
[47:22] uh Bitcoin businesses like micro
[47:24] strategy with
[47:26] uh Bitcoin influencers uh uh like
[47:29] Bitcoin social media creators however
[47:31] you want to call it uh with Bitcoin
[47:33] people that are now even like just
[47:35] adopted it as a store of value that just
[47:38] talked about that in in their in their
[47:40] family and friend circles I think about
[47:42] a lot because um like I posted I think
[47:45] today the meme where like oh get ready
[47:47] for the calls because we're getting
[47:49] closer to like the the alltime high and
[47:52] then the old body calls you oh you
[47:54] talked like two years back at this party
[47:57] about Bitcoin where can I buy Bitcoin
[48:00] how do you see that like and it will be
[48:02] interesting to see where where all this
[48:05] leads to in the end for for bitcoiners
[48:08] and Bitcoin businesses and all this
[48:11] stuff um
[48:14] yeah
[48:15] um
[48:17] for Bitcoin and you you mentioned it
[48:20] that you have a wife and that you have
[48:23] you're getting now the second child and
[48:25] I see that is like a common pattern
[48:28] around bit Corners they are usually
[48:30] really family focused uh they're usually
[48:34] uh I don't want to generalize but
[48:36] they're usually really careful where
[48:38] they spend their time uh they are really
[48:41] careful about family having a having a
[48:45] good foundation for them and reproducing
[48:48] themselves with kids um where do you see
[48:52] like Traditional Values and conservatism
[48:55] with
[48:56] Bitcoin paired do you see like a um
[48:59] connection there because we also see
[49:02] that Bitcoin in the end of the day is
[49:03] just money but it seems that especially
[49:06] those who are now adopting Bitcoin uh
[49:09] have those uh tradition Traditional
[49:11] Values and have those kind of mindsets
[49:15] well I think there's
[49:17] a lot of things playing into that and
[49:22] going back to what you said about micro
[49:24] strategy or just the plebs the people
[49:27] the early adopters the early adopters as
[49:30] bitcoin's price appreciates and as the
[49:32] demonetization takes place they have
[49:35] more economic energy that they can
[49:37] deploy to fund things that the market
[49:41] wants and I think that the fiscal
[49:44] responsibility that comes from spending
[49:47] your money that you earned even if it
[49:50] appreciated in value is much different
[49:52] than spending someone else's money or
[49:54] money being printed Ed out of thin air
[49:56] so I think that there's going to be
[49:58] Prudence the use of the energy and the
[50:01] resources is going to be much more
[50:03] logical and rational you know as an
[50:05] example Michael sailor he's not likely
[50:07] to spend his personal 20,000 Bitcoin
[50:11] funding gender gender studies in the
[50:13] prison systems across the world it's a
[50:16] ridiculous use of capital as an example
[50:18] at least in my opinion so I think that
[50:21] people become more prudent and
[50:24] additionally the fact that you have a
[50:26] metaphysical monetary instrument that's
[50:28] truly scarce it means that you can hoard
[50:31] this instrument and you're going to get
[50:33] the most optionality within the
[50:34] marketplace within the future
[50:36] probabilistically speaking a as opposed
[50:39] to hoarding physical stuff so what that
[50:41] does though is there's this inversion in
[50:43] this understanding where you
[50:46] realize that we have enough we just need
[50:49] to figure out how to trade differently
[50:52] and to treat our resources differently
[50:54] and you don't don't have to force
[50:56] somebody to make some selfless
[51:00] sacrifice because now the selfish thing
[51:03] is actually the thing that's the best
[51:04] for the individual is the thing that's
[51:06] the best for the collective and that's
[51:08] that's that you hoard this invisible
[51:10] monetary instruments and so the people
[51:12] within Bitcoin that realize that you
[51:15] know it's like the opposite of the
[51:17] people that are really stuck in the Fiat
[51:20] clown world that think to themselves the
[51:22] world is a disgusting despicable place
[51:24] the last thing I would ever want to do
[51:26] is is bring a child into this world I
[51:28] hear people speak to that all the time I
[51:29] can't have a child they can't afford it
[51:31] the resources are too SC how am I going
[51:33] to have a kid and struggle to feed them
[51:35] all this poisonous Fiat [ __ ] garbage
[51:39] how am I why am I gonna have a kid and
[51:40] spend the next 15 years of my life poor
[51:43] being gaslit poisoned and lied to and
[51:46] try to protect my kid from the lunacy in
[51:49] the world it's a very decentivize
[51:55] ology or more so pathology it'll result
[51:58] in the ex the end of the existence of
[52:00] our species so it's it's it's not within
[52:03] our self-interest and so you realize
[52:06] though as a bitcoiner that there is
[52:08] abundance of resources and the fact that
[52:11] you can you have scarcity in money
[52:13] creates abundance in resources because
[52:15] the incentive is to hold the money the
[52:17] money is invisible it's not gold also
[52:19] here's another problem with gold as a
[52:21] money gold was really cool before
[52:23] computers and bulldozers as far as the
[52:25] monetary instrument because of the five
[52:26] properties of money if the gold price
[52:29] goes up from two grand an ounce to $2500
[52:33] announced you now have more of an
[52:35] economic incentive to meet that Demand
[52:39] with Supply and some miners will take
[52:41] bulldozers and just go rip up the forest
[52:43] floor so that's not good for Earth and
[52:45] it's not good for anybody but it is a
[52:48] satiating
[52:49] that Perpetual inevitable like ever
[52:53] existing need to try to figure out how
[52:55] to acquire the most resources and so as
[52:58] bitcoiners we realize that we have the
[53:00] most precious resources sailor says it's
[53:02] the hardest substance in the known
[53:04] universe so I can procure the hardest
[53:07] substance in the known universe it's
[53:09] invisible I if I custody it properly you
[53:11] can't [ __ ] get it from me no matter
[53:13] what and that that essentially paints
[53:16] this picture of like hold on as
[53:18] everybody else does that now housing is
[53:20] cheaper now food producers can produce
[53:23] healthy and clean food and then you
[53:25] remove over time if the Fiat apparatus
[53:28] is removed it will break down these very
[53:31] large Central corporations that rape and
[53:34] pillage and you know it may not be
[53:37] consciously but it's just through the
[53:38] incentives it's going to break all those
[53:41] those two big the proverbial two big to
[53:43] fail businesses down and it's going to
[53:46] decentralize the production of
[53:48] everything and it's going to reward
[53:51] Bitcoin will reward over a long enough
[53:53] time Horizon the people who provide the
[53:56] most valuable product and I assure you a
[54:00] grain fed sick
[54:03] unhealthy piece of meat is not the most
[54:07] valuable even if it costs less US
[54:09] Dollars than a ethically produced
[54:12] grass-fed cow for example or the cheap
[54:16] Chinese made widget that they make
[54:19] billions of them a second or whatever it
[54:21] is the widget that just lasts six months
[54:23] that you throw away that's not the most
[54:26] valuable product the most valuable
[54:28] product is the thing that you can
[54:29] purchase that you'll get the most use
[54:31] out of over the long term and typically
[54:33] it's going to be more expensive but the
[54:35] people who produce the most valuable
[54:37] products and services in time are going
[54:39] to dominate The Marketplace and have the
[54:41] coins and the
[54:43] bitcoiners who have thought about it
[54:45] long enough and hard enough and are
[54:47] intellectually honest and open to new
[54:50] ideas and Concepts they realize this and
[54:53] that's quite hopeful you know sailor
[54:55] says it Bitcoin is hope you know Booth
[54:58] says it he goes you know he doesn't pay
[55:00] attention or yell at the old world the
[55:02] old system because it just strengthens
[55:04] it he lives entirely in the new system
[55:06] he focuses on the new system and and so
[55:08] both simultaneously we have the world is
[55:12] falling apart and going into shambles
[55:15] but at the same time we're ascending
[55:18] into a higher state of consciousness
[55:20] we're ascending into a new bright orange
[55:22] future where the value the people who
[55:24] created the most value are the ones who
[55:26] are going to end up with the most
[55:27] economic energy and those people are
[55:29] predisposed or primed or they've been
[55:32] rewarded by doing valuable things and
[55:34] they're going to do more valuable things
[55:36] they have skin in the game they're going
[55:39] to deploy their Capital much more
[55:40] rationally and
[55:43] honestly yeah I think all those things
[55:45] really just
[55:46] fuel the idea the world is going to be
[55:50] good and there is enough and we should
[55:52] have kids and we should ban together and
[55:55] it's a win-win and I think that looking
[55:57] at the world through the lens of the old
[56:00] world which is how I put it it's hard to
[56:02] see that because all you see is scarcity
[56:05] all you see is plunder all you see is
[56:07] game theoretic
[56:08] fuckness and if you understand Bitcoin
[56:11] you're looking at an entirely different
[56:12] world and lastly on that thought it
[56:15] allows you to see what's actually
[56:17] happening you know I listen to like some
[56:19] of the smartest people in the world talk
[56:21] about and debate things and if they
[56:23] don't understand Bitcoin
[56:25] it's almost painful to listen to the
[56:28] debates taking place about how do we
[56:31] combat these issues I can't even
[56:34] allocate energy into listening to some
[56:36] of this stuff because if you're not
[56:37] going to talk about the debasement of
[56:39] the currency and the killionaire effect
[56:40] and the Taxation and the need for more
[56:42] Taxation and property confiscation and
[56:44] more debasement you're missing the point
[56:47] and so yeah the incentive Vortex is so
[56:50] strong the ngu tech is so strong I think
[56:54] as bit coiners because of that I think
[56:56] it's it's um I think it's productive to
[56:58] remind ourselves that the incentives are
[57:00] so strong that we can just take a deep
[57:01] breath and calm down like people are
[57:03] going to figure it out it's
[57:04] self-preservation the more painful it
[57:06] becomes the more the incentive to figure
[57:09] out why you're in pain is and more
[57:11] people will and so I think that there's
[57:13] an scurve and I think that the faster
[57:16] the the longer the longer Bitcoin
[57:18] appreciates on average at a
[57:21] significantly faster rate than
[57:24] everything else in the marketplace the
[57:27] faster or the larger the group of
[57:30] people grows that understands why that
[57:34] that's happening and the more people
[57:35] that understand why that that's
[57:37] happening then the more people that are
[57:39] not interested in borrowing against
[57:42] their real estate portfolio to go buy
[57:44] more real estate dude I've made friends
[57:47] on Twitter you know I got a buddy in uh
[57:50] the Midwest that's got a bunch of rental
[57:52] properties he's selling off his rental
[57:54] properties to buy Bitcoin dude him and I
[57:57] had an hourong conversation the other
[57:59] day and he's just like man I had to
[58:00] [ __ ] replace another water heater
[58:03] he's like you know the rates are so high
[58:05] that I either have to raise my rent or
[58:07] just break even on this monetary
[58:09] instrument that I'm that I'm holding my
[58:11] economic energy in he goes it's just
[58:13] literally it's a he sent me a picture of
[58:14] a a Post-It note a little breakdown I
[58:17] buy Bitcoin and this is the result and I
[58:19] buy this real estate property here's my
[58:21] cost here's my rent I'm breaking even
[58:24] and I got to allate energy to do so so
[58:27] it's just the energy efficient
[58:29] strategy and uh it's big deal man it's a
[58:33] big deal it's fascinating to see um and
[58:37] it gets so much clearer now because you
[58:40] have on the one side Bitcoin where the
[58:42] incentive to go into Bitcoin is getting
[58:45] strong and strong with every day that
[58:47] Bitcoin lives on and Bitcoin gets
[58:48] stronger and better and with every day
[58:52] and on the other side of that road and
[58:54] with the fat system whatever you're
[58:55] doing in the Fiat system renting and
[58:57] stuff like that the pain gets just more
[58:59] and more uh so you're having that system
[59:02] where like oh I'm here and I'm
[59:04] struggling a lot maybe let's try this
[59:08] and it just becomes more apparent I
[59:10] think every day uh to do just that but
[59:14] maybe talking to um bitcoiners that are
[59:17] already on a Bitcoin standard they're
[59:18] doing uh they like self custody
[59:21] everything they're like on a Bitcoin
[59:23] standard um what else uh can we do above
[59:28] adopting Bitcoin to expand uh and this
[59:32] is a non-bitcoin question to expand on
[59:34] our personal freedom uh or differently
[59:38] asked um what would you do to um better
[59:41] your situation if there would not be a
[59:44] Bitcoin
[59:45] there well first thing that comes to
[59:47] mind in bettering the world is one of
[59:50] Sailor rules be cheerful and
[59:53] constructive and so I think
[59:56] that as as beings living in this realm
[60:00] let's use those that that that
[60:03] description contending with the
[60:05] challenges of this
[60:07] reality
[60:09] can be hard
[60:11] obviously and that I think generally
[60:14] causes people to respond differently
[60:17] depending on the person but as things
[60:19] become progressively harder in our Fiat
[60:22] world there's a a ever growing state of
[60:26] psychosis that causes people to become
[60:29] edgy and shitty and
[60:31] angry and so regardless of the existence
[60:34] of Bitcoin or not I think that the that
[60:37] it's important that we stay cheerful and
[60:40] constructive and and to get a little
[60:42] Mees metaphysical or Cosmic you know
[60:45] Nicola Tesla said if you want to
[60:46] understand the secrets of the universe
[60:48] think in terms of energy vibration and
[60:50] frequency and I do think
[60:53] that the law law of attraction is is
[60:55] like a theoretically speaking at least
[60:58] it's a it's a seems to be a law that
[61:00] exists in our world where your
[61:02] vibrational frequency or your Vibes or
[61:05] your energy is being mirrored to you in
[61:07] the world around you and so being angry
[61:10] and shitty even if things are
[61:12] challenging is never
[61:15] productive and if we didn't have
[61:18] Bitcoin through the monetary incentives
[61:21] the incentive is is essentially always
[61:25] to convert a weak property into a strong
[61:29] property a property that's inflating in
[61:32] Supply at a slower rate than another
[61:35] property that's high in demand it's
[61:37] Supply demand Dynamics and so if Bitcoin
[61:40] didn't exist you know I was I was in I
[61:42] was a gold bug uh you know also that has
[61:46] a lot to do with the nature of the line
[61:48] of work that I have been called to do
[61:50] and you know I've been producing
[61:52] cannabis since I don't know been into
[61:54] cannabis since I was a teenager um and
[61:57] I've been producing it professionally
[61:58] for 15 years and I haven't had a lot of
[62:01] access to the traditional Finance world
[62:03] as a result of producing a federally
[62:06] illegal product even though it's been
[62:09] lawful to do so for the entire time I've
[62:12] been doing it here in the state of
[62:13] California uh I've been limited to what
[62:15] kind of Fiat or trafi perks that I've
[62:19] had as an example so it's been difficult
[62:21] for me if I've earned a surplus to get
[62:23] that Surplus into the bank because I I
[62:25] live in an all cash business so I was a
[62:28] gold bug I was into to precious metals
[62:30] and if Bitcoin didn't exist through the
[62:33] just sheare incentives I would probably
[62:36] be purchasing real estate and leveraging
[62:38] that real estate to buy more real
[62:40] estate and unfortunately all of those
[62:43] things really are bad for the
[62:45] marketplace so it's like I don't know
[62:47] it's just one of those thank God thank
[62:49] Satoshi for Bitcoin things like you know
[62:53] without Bitcoin we were in serious
[62:55] trouble you know breed love says this or
[62:57] he said it a long time ago I heard him
[62:59] say this one time and it's just one of
[63:00] his just really heady epic quotes it's
[63:04] like Bitcoin is an emical response from
[63:07] a Marketplace that was suffering from
[63:09] extreme toxicity he didn't use those
[63:11] exact words but it's pretty much
[63:13] something like that and so at the time
[63:15] we needed it at the most Bitcoin
[63:17] surfaced you know this invisible thing
[63:20] hyper Mobile Capital you know gold
[63:24] because of its physicality it did
[63:26] require Fiat or a layer two for us to
[63:30] scale our Marketplace and for us to
[63:32] trade globally you can't send physical
[63:36] gold around so we had to have Fiat Fiat
[63:38] was a stepping stone Fiat
[63:40] was better than physical gold as far as
[63:44] the limitations of physical gold the
[63:46] unfortunate thing is is that it's a
[63:47] Honeypot it's coopt it's corruptible and
[63:50] so now that we have this monetary
[63:52] instrument let's once again another
[63:54] brief Li saying he says it's the
[63:55] discovery of uncorrupt
[63:58] ability so yeah if it wasn't for Bitcoin
[64:01] I'd probably have real estate and uh
[64:03] well I would I I don't know that I would
[64:04] have sold my property actually if it
[64:06] wasn't for Bitcoin and
[64:08] so yeah I'd have real estate I'd have
[64:11] gold now I have no real estate and I
[64:14] have no gold and I'm
[64:17] grateful Bitcoin only and I feel safer
[64:20] honestly I went into my wife uh one one
[64:23] day I was like a year ago or so nine
[64:25] months ago I had a little I had some we
[64:27] had some economic energy in an
[64:29] investment that was other than Bitcoin
[64:30] some
[64:31] silver and the plan was to use the
[64:34] silver as a down payment on a house
[64:37] someday and it just hit me like hard
[64:40] like a kick in the nuts I'm just working
[64:43] I was like bow hold on why am I holding
[64:46] the silver first off it's an absolutely
[64:49] terrible money it's terrible money it's
[64:51] commodity if the price goes up they'll
[64:52] just mine more of it it's it's the
[64:54] horrible investment being a cannabis
[64:57] producer and not having all of the Fiat
[65:00] perks uh you know is part of why I had
[65:04] this silver but I realized that if I
[65:06] allocated that that Capital into Bitcoin
[65:09] versus a house that a handful of things
[65:12] would happen one I would get wealthier
[65:14] probabilistically over the long run and
[65:17] also I was safer so I went in and I
[65:20] asked my wife I'm like hey check it out
[65:21] so I had a little thought here like why
[65:22] do we want a house right you want to go
[65:24] buy a house well it's so that we're safe
[65:27] essentially right so that we can raise
[65:29] our family and have a safe place to be
[65:32] well honestly it's not really that great
[65:34] of a strategy because real estate has
[65:37] maintenance costs you could have an
[65:39] earthquake you could have a fire you
[65:41] know so what we want is optionality
[65:44] within the marketplace what we want is a
[65:46] lot of economic energy what we want is
[65:48] to hold a strong property and I said as
[65:51] a sweetheart we have the hardest
[65:52] substance and then no universe and and
[65:55] converting any of that into a physical
[65:58] house at this time and place in history
[66:01] I think is a flawed strategy that and if
[66:03] we rent one we get wealthier but we have
[66:06] more optionality let's say all of a
[66:07] suddenly California says hey we want to
[66:10] tax your red meat 30% done I'm gone but
[66:14] if I owned a home here I got to sell it
[66:15] pay a commission of 6% California could
[66:19] also just be like you know what hey uh
[66:20] we're broke because the Fiat world is so
[66:22] [ __ ] and we're going to raise your
[66:24] property tax all of a sudden some Fiat
[66:27] Mega Corporation some insurance company
[66:28] says hey you know what we're broke our
[66:30] margins are getting harder to procure
[66:32] it's harder to make money in the
[66:33] marketplace our cost of operating is
[66:36] going up uh we're just going to raise
[66:38] your homeowners insurance what are you
[66:40] gonna do toast
[66:43] so yeah I I um I live in a rental and I
[66:47] will for the
[66:49] foreseeable forever and I'm going to
[66:51] continue to stack SATs because I think
[66:53] that that Prov provides me more
[66:55] optionality and more safety and more
[66:57] freedom and also more Fiat or just Mar
[67:02] just more
[67:03] convertibility of into goods or services
[67:05] in the future as holding Bitcoin as a
[67:07] monetary instrument as then merging two
[67:09] things what comes really blurry like
[67:11] what's the value of the house really
[67:12] like we don't know until real estate's
[67:15] demonetized so yeah I think it's a bad
[67:19] bad investment currently yeah definitely
[67:21] it's I think I mean I I want to use the
[67:24] word bubble but it's a it's a good word
[67:27] I think to describe the current um uh
[67:30] real estate situation um we having an we
[67:34] having an end routine in the podcast
[67:36] where the previous guest asks the
[67:38] question for the next guest uh and it's
[67:40] an interesting one we like I I almost
[67:44] touched on that question uh what has
[67:46] Bitcoin contributed to your life besides
[67:49] the monetary aspect well hope hope an
[67:54] immense amount American H says it it's
[67:56] rational optimism it's I'm
[67:59] rationally mathematically
[68:04] probabilistically
[68:05] optimistic I think
[68:08] that the fact that we have Bitcoin kind
[68:11] of circles in and encompasses everything
[68:13] that I've spoken to here or we talked
[68:15] about in that you have this metaphysical
[68:18] instrument this metaphysical instrument
[68:21] that's invisible that if I look at you I
[68:24] don't know if you have any or how much
[68:26] you have but if you own a bunch of
[68:28] buildings it's pretty obvious now you
[68:30] got to get political you have to
[68:32] participate in this system that has
[68:35] essentially been
[68:37] corrupted and that's like
[68:40] um that self- sovereignty or that that
[68:43] game theoretic inversion that takes
[68:47] place now that you have this invisible
[68:48] monetary instrument that even if I
[68:50] Implement plunder and violence that I
[68:52] don't get well that defunds violence
[68:55] it's incentivizes peace and
[68:58] cooperation uh it makes it so you know
[69:00] here's another great breed Love Line you
[69:02] know the that the political app
[69:05] apparatus will become beholden to the
[69:07] preferences of its participants you know
[69:10] it's citizens the government will be
[69:11] beholden to the preferences of the
[69:13] citizens and so for me it just instills
[69:16] an enormous amount of Hope the longer
[69:19] and longer I think about it the more and
[69:22] more don't think it that it's probable I
[69:26] think it's inevitable
[69:29] like at this point unless we have a
[69:32] Black Swan an unknowable unknown an
[69:34] unknown unknown I you know Bitcoin as
[69:37] long as it exists all roads lead to
[69:39] bitcoin and the fact that that's
[69:41] happening it means that we live in a
[69:43] world where we have created true
[69:44] scarcity in the money where you have
[69:46] scarcity in the money you have abundance
[69:48] and everything else and so I believe
[69:52] currently as of right now
[69:54] we live in an abundant world and the
[69:57] people who use and understand Bitcoin
[69:59] have access to that abundance and more
[70:01] and more so on the daily basis and other
[70:05] than the monetary benefits which they
[70:09] all really stem back to the monetary
[70:11] benefits or your convertibility to
[70:13] things in the
[70:16] marketplace Bitcoin is making the world
[70:19] better for people who have zero Bitcoin
[70:22] and zero under understanding of Bitcoin
[70:25] and that is also very hopeful I don't
[70:27] know how many black Black Rock clients I
[70:31] don't know how many black rock
[70:34] clients allocated her money to their ETF
[70:38] the Bitcoin ETF but it's obviously an
[70:41] enormous amount of coins that black rock
[70:43] has procured to give their clients
[70:45] exposure how
[70:47] many dollars went into Bitcoin and not
[70:51] into homes black rocks been buying
[70:54] houses Black Rock has a fiduciary
[70:56] responsibility to provide economic value
[70:58] to their shareholders and so they've
[71:00] been doing The Logical reasonable thing
[71:02] and that's buying Assets in the
[71:04] marketplace well they are now buying an
[71:07] asset that's truly scarce it's
[71:11] Incorruptible it's an open and honest
[71:13] public Ledger and it's the act the
[71:16] monetary instrument is [ __ ]
[71:19] invisible and so that is making the
[71:21] world better for everybody
[71:24] regardless of whether you have Bitcoin
[71:26] currently or not and that's a big deal
[71:29] and that's super exciting and it
[71:32] actually just I'm
[71:34] like borderline not too upset about the
[71:38] world the the in the woes in the world
[71:40] the suffering it really [ __ ] me up like
[71:43] don't get me wrong like I I struggle
[71:45] with all the suffering plundering the
[71:47] starving the the the
[71:51] humanitarian crisis that's taking place
[71:54] don't get me wrong but I believe that
[71:57] it's coming to an end and you know it's
[71:59] it's 10 years is it 100 years is 500
[72:02] years I don't know but if you look over
[72:04] a long enough time Horizon in some sense
[72:06] it kind of doesn't really matter I think
[72:07] we all roads lead to bitcoin so it's
[72:10] very exciting that's an amazing summary
[72:13] it's it's it's actually fascinating I
[72:15] have actually to dat my 50 uh 50th
[72:18] episode of the podcast uh and uh there's
[72:22] like different uh I already interviewed
[72:24] Jeff Bo I interviewed even random blabs
[72:27] that have almost no following but I met
[72:30] them somehow and I was like yeah let's
[72:31] let's get them on the podcast like I
[72:32] have a a really big variety of guests on
[72:36] the podcast and and and you are till now
[72:40] one of my favorites you have an amazing
[72:44] way to get the question and have such an
[72:49] rounding uh answer that diiminates all
[72:53] my follow-up questions while you're
[72:56] speaking it's fascina fascinating to see
[72:59] uh so uh basically thank you for for
[73:02] being on Eric and I I definitely want to
[73:04] do a round two in in some some amount of
[73:07] time and
