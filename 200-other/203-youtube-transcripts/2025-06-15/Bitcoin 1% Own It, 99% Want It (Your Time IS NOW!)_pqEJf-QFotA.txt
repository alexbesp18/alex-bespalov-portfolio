[00:00] So the goal of this thing was to provide
[00:02] a fictional story that's just as
[00:04] absolutely like interesting and
[00:05] thrilling as possible that is just
[00:07] fascinating enough for people to keep
[00:09] reading through and in doing so have
[00:11] exposure to Bitcoin in this story that
[00:13] or they learn a lot about it
[00:14] incrementally. Bitcoin to me is like one
[00:16] of the best ever representations of a
[00:19] digital life form that's constantly
[00:21] growing, evolving, adapting in a
[00:23] resilient way to the world acting around
[00:25] it where at once you had to go to a
[00:27] singular centralized party who had
[00:29] control of this book who'd often
[00:31] disseminate the information to through
[00:32] their lens and then gave the power to
[00:34] the individual in the exact same way
[00:36] that Bitcoin is giving more power to the
[00:37] individual. No longer do we have to rely
[00:39] on somebody to control our money for us.
[00:41] We can just do it ourselves if we want
[00:42] to. We're very much ruled by emotions.
[00:45] So story provides a really unique way to
[00:46] like embed an idea into emotions and
[00:49] hopefully like I can embed the idea of
[00:51] Bitcoin into some of these ones where
[00:52] really like people have a visceral
[00:54] reaction to it when they're going
[00:55] through this as the
[00:56] [Music]
[01:00] character. You told me you're writing
[01:02] every single day since like 8 years uh
[01:06] on uh on your second book. You're now
[01:08] writing since what three years or
[01:10] something like that. Yeah, I'm three
[01:12] years into this one. been writing every
[01:14] single day for about eight now. Uh it
[01:16] was kind of like a bucket list item at
[01:18] first. It was just something I sort of
[01:19] wanted to do. Like I'm sure a lot of
[01:20] people have felt the urge to write
[01:23] something before. So just tried it out
[01:24] and completely fell in love with it. Um
[01:26] it really melded well with my
[01:28] personality because I am a very
[01:29] disciplined person by nature and love
[01:31] creating stuff. So fell in love and here
[01:33] we are like writing a Bitcoin novel now
[01:35] for the last three. Interesting. Uh, and
[01:38] you wrote also Bitcoin uh or like what
[01:41] what book did you write before? Uh, the
[01:44] first book I wrote is called The Final
[01:45] Flaw. It's a near future sci-fi book
[01:48] about uh removing genetic uh
[01:51] disadvantages from the gene pool and the
[01:54] main character trying to prevent that
[01:56] from happening. Interesting. And you uh
[02:00] as I understand it, you are a software
[02:02] engineer
[02:04] uh who
[02:06] discovered writing novels for for a
[02:09] living. I always um I love like teaching
[02:13] myself stuff. I love learning my pretty
[02:14] much my whole life, which is definitely
[02:15] one of the things that brought me to
[02:16] Bitcoin initially, too. But I was
[02:19] self-taught guitar um and a few other
[02:22] things, too. But then I after graduating
[02:24] college, I was like I've been so
[02:27] interested in technology. I have for my
[02:28] entire life. I was like, I bet I could
[02:30] teach myself how to write code. I just
[02:31] essentially dedicated a year of my life
[02:33] to studying doing that. Completely
[02:35] changing career trajectories and
[02:38] becoming a software engineer. And in the
[02:40] last few years, I've been doing the same
[02:42] thing, but with writing. I just kind of
[02:44] love to throw my entire self at
[02:46] something and create things. And I I
[02:48] fell in love with writing now, too. Uh,
[02:51] amazing. Are you also into reading a
[02:54] lot? Are you also reading a lot or more
[02:56] on the on the on the producing side? I
[02:59] like making more than I like reading,
[03:01] but I love both. Like I felt I've been
[03:03] in love with books since I was young and
[03:04] stories more broadly even too. Like uh I
[03:07] like in any format. Um I've got whole
[03:09] I've got books around me all over the
[03:11] place here. Got some my favorite sci-fi
[03:13] out there. Yeah. Literally every single
[03:14] genre from sci-fi, fantasy, thrillers,
[03:18] mysteries, even some romance stuff and
[03:20] whatever. Like I just I genuinely love
[03:22] story and um it's been a really big
[03:25] bonding thing with my wife and I too cuz
[03:26] she's quite a talented editor. So her
[03:28] and I are just constantly like
[03:29] dissecting stories, what's makes them
[03:31] good and uh yeah throwing ourselves at
[03:34] that and it's just a fun problem to
[03:35] solve too. I know it's kind of like
[03:36] strange for a software engineer to love
[03:38] fiction writing too, but in my mind
[03:40] they're like very similar skills in a
[03:42] lot of ways of uh just slowly chipping
[03:44] away at really large problems that have
[03:47] never been solved before and finding
[03:48] solutions for them in as beautiful a way
[03:50] possible. And you are doing that uh
[03:54] full-time the writing or you're still a
[03:56] software developer or how how does that
[03:57] work? Both. I'm Moonlight as a writer.
[03:59] So you're so you're writing for for a
[04:02] living both software and novels.
[04:04] Exactly.
[04:07] I go crazy nerdy with it, too. I write
[04:09] all of my writing in a code editor as
[04:12] well. So, like even all my novel writing
[04:14] is in a programming IDE.
[04:17] Wait, you're writing your novels in like
[04:20] Visual Studio Code or something like
[04:21] that. Exactly. Yeah. Nice.
[04:26] if that gives you any insight to how
[04:27] nerdy of a person I am.
[04:31] It's it's interesting because um I also
[04:34] started writing down thoughts and
[04:36] lessons and insights that I have from
[04:37] the podcast just to like sort my
[04:39] thoughts because I'm more and more
[04:40] guests on other podcasts and they keep
[04:42] asking me what I've learned from the
[04:44] podcast and I was like I I should come
[04:45] up with good answers uh to those
[04:48] questions. Uh and I just have Google
[04:51] Docs. It's it's very uh it's it's it's
[04:54] it's very unprofessional. It's just like
[04:58] a piece of paper where I write stuff on
[04:59] there basically. But never occurred to
[05:01] me to write things in Visual Studio Code
[05:04] other than uh code. I am also software
[05:07] developer actually by trade myself. So
[05:09] but that that never occurred to to me.
[05:12] It was definitely an evolution. It
[05:14] didn't start that way. I actually kind
[05:15] of started in the same realm of you did
[05:16] where I just used writing as a way to
[05:18] think through things to kind of
[05:19] crystallize thoughts and provide like
[05:22] better thinking about something I've
[05:24] been trying to solve, problems I've been
[05:26] solving or thinking through. And it kind
[05:27] of evolved from there just like me
[05:29] working through things that I was really
[05:30] interested in and trying to solve stuff
[05:32] like that better. Um, and then
[05:34] eventually like as I've been doing this
[05:36] for thousands of hours at this point, I
[05:38] like have refined and refined and
[05:39] refined my writing process to the point
[05:41] where I'm using all sorts of programming
[05:42] tools, AI tools like version control, if
[05:45] you're feel familiar with that or
[05:46] anybody in the audience is familiar with
[05:48] programming tools. I use pretty much all
[05:50] those things for writing and that way I
[05:52] can have like different subsequent
[05:53] thoughts going at the same time and
[05:55] stuff that I'm experimenting with.
[05:56] Exactly. Yeah, it's never thought about
[05:58] that that actually how you develop code
[06:01] could be actually also a good way of how
[06:03] to
[06:04] develop a book uh and and also with the
[06:07] forks in in the in there and then you
[06:09] can merge things together. It's
[06:11] basically perfect actually. Never
[06:13] thought about that. And I mean uh it's
[06:15] also great for collaboration, but you're
[06:17] writing on those things completely
[06:19] alone, right? It's not like you you're
[06:21] writing with someone else. Yeah, it's
[06:23] solo writing, but I've worked with a
[06:25] bunch of people at this point, like 30
[06:26] different beta readers and things
[06:28] because I'm kind of nearing the last
[06:29] stage of the journey here finishing this
[06:31] thing up. Um, yeah, it's I I'm kind of
[06:35] surprised more people aren't doing this
[06:36] to be honest with you. I I really work
[06:37] iteratively. Again, I think that's one
[06:39] of the skills you sort of learn from
[06:40] working on software and applying that
[06:42] same style to writing novels, too. It's
[06:45] worked pretty well for me at least. But
[06:47] yeah, we'll see how the book turns out.
[06:49] I'm really pumped to share it. Is
[06:52] everything in one? So, sorry for the
[06:55] audience for me to nerd out on that, but
[06:57] is everything in one file or do you keep
[07:00] each chapter in a different file or how
[07:02] do you organize that? Yeah, exactly.
[07:04] It's every different file. So, it's a
[07:06] little more searchable like code would
[07:07] be. I have keywords in it. And then like
[07:10] some of the nicest things about
[07:11] programming editors are like find,
[07:13] global, find, and replace and those kind
[07:16] of things and searchability. Typically,
[07:17] programming editors are better at
[07:19] searching stuff than like regular
[07:20] writing editors. An extra level of nerdy
[07:22] on top of this is I use tools like Vim
[07:24] for like text manipulation and things.
[07:27] Anyway, it's like crazy nerdy and I've
[07:29] invested a lot of time into refining
[07:30] this over the years, but it's kind of
[07:32] the point where like the friction from
[07:33] my mind to story is like faster than
[07:35] it's ever been. Um, still working on it
[07:38] every day, but it's like that's like one
[07:40] of the biggest things with writing is
[07:42] making it so the thought is is quickly
[07:44] down on the page as it possibly can be.
[07:46] So that coupled with some AI tools have
[07:48] been kind of helpful too for like
[07:50] autocompleting senses and that sort of
[07:52] thing. Interesting. And how did you then
[07:56] come to Bitcoin and discover Bitcoin and
[07:59] and also how did you decide to write
[08:01] about uh Bitcoin and a novel about
[08:04] Bitcoin? So I feel like my path to
[08:06] Bitcoin was similar to a lot of people
[08:07] like uh had exposure to it back in the
[08:11] the Silk Roadie kind of days. Didn't
[08:13] really think much of it. Didn't have any
[08:15] interest in it. kind of pass it off as
[08:17] like something that was cool, just a fun
[08:19] little project, but I didn't pursue it
[08:21] anymore. Had some friends and
[08:23] acquaintances just essentially gambling
[08:25] with like Ethereum back in like 2017
[08:27] period. Still was like they weren't no
[08:30] one was talking about Bitcoin back then,
[08:31] at least that I was exposed to. So I
[08:33] again brushed it off and then 2020 2021
[08:36] time came along and I like as many
[08:39] people you're like locked in your home,
[08:40] you're thinking a lot more about money
[08:42] and had a lot more exposure to it then.
[08:44] And then in early 2021,
[08:47] um, had finally done a little bit of
[08:48] research and was like instantly
[08:50] basically just straight down to the
[08:52] depths of the rabbit hole and it's been
[08:54] a complete obsession ever since. Which
[08:56] leads into the writing thing. I had
[08:57] published my first novel 2022 and
[09:00] literally from the moment of finishing
[09:02] that one, I knew I'd wanted to write a
[09:03] Bitcoin novel for almost a year at that
[09:05] point and then just started it
[09:07] immediately. Um, most Bitcoin books are
[09:11] are basically, oh, what's the problem
[09:14] with with fiat? And and uh here's why
[09:17] Bitcoin is the best solution. And uh if
[09:19] you go down the reading Bitcoin books,
[09:22] you actually find that this is kind of
[09:24] the structure of most of them uh of like
[09:28] different ways of how to explain the
[09:31] fiat problem and different ways on how
[09:33] to uh make analogies and comparisons on
[09:36] why Bitcoin is the perfect solution. Uh
[09:39] there are ways like oh like let's
[09:40] compare to the printing press, let's
[09:41] compare to the gold standard, let's like
[09:43] there's so many different ways to go
[09:45] down. But the basic principle of the
[09:47] Bitcoin books is is is uh quite similar
[09:51] and novel is is different uh from there
[09:54] because there's a whole different story
[09:55] around that. Um why did you uh
[09:59] uh uh chose that route of going with a
[10:03] novel and is your target also to orange
[10:07] pill people or just to entertain people
[10:10] in in that way? It's a mixture. I have
[10:13] two target audiences in mind. Target
[10:14] audience one being Bitcoiners. Like this
[10:16] is book is essentially a love letter to
[10:18] Bitcoiners in a lot of ways. But target
[10:20] audience two is the loved ones of
[10:22] Bitcoiners that you've struggled to
[10:23] orange pill. So like for me again
[10:26] engineer I really love reading about
[10:29] like the structure of how economies
[10:32] work, the history of money, all of those
[10:34] sorts of things. The non-fiction Bitcoin
[10:36] books were just things I fell in love
[10:37] with. But I'm sure like many people
[10:40] you've struggled to orange pill loved
[10:42] ones or people close to you in your
[10:43] life. And I think there is still a major
[10:46] lacking hole in Bitcoin um books in
[10:50] general for people that just are going
[10:52] to refuse to read things like the
[10:53] Bitcoin standard. Like I absolutely
[10:55] adore those books, but like my wife is
[10:58] not going to read them. She just has no
[10:59] interest in reading something about
[11:01] that. So the goal of this thing was to
[11:03] provide a fictional story that's just as
[11:05] absolutely like interesting and
[11:07] thrilling as possible that is just
[11:10] fascinating enough for people to keep
[11:11] reading through. and in doing so have
[11:14] exposure to Bitcoin in this story that
[11:16] or they learn a bot about it
[11:17] incrementally. So, it's both really
[11:19] enjoyable for Bitcoiners because it's
[11:20] just genuinely written to be as good of
[11:21] a story as possible, but also uh like
[11:24] teaches you stuff along the way. Um like
[11:27] we can get into it if you want to, but
[11:29] uh my favorite character in the book
[11:30] starts living in a third world country
[11:32] and has to escape using um Bitcoin in
[11:35] her brain to get across the border
[11:37] having failed with like fiat currencies
[11:39] and gold. And um it goes a lot from
[11:42] there. But like actually having that
[11:43] visceral experience of riding around in
[11:45] somebody's brain as they're going
[11:46] through this really traumatic experience
[11:48] and seeing how Bitcoin directly solves
[11:50] their problems is just a different style
[11:53] of thing than has existed before. And I
[11:55] just like I've wanted this to exist for
[11:57] a long time. So I'm writing it
[11:58] basically. That's amazing. I think it's
[12:00] also way more powerful uh of of showing
[12:04] uh people what you can actually do
[12:06] because if you just if you say oh like
[12:09] Bitcoin has uh the capability is limited
[12:12] with 21 million it has capability to be
[12:15] stored in your brain that's great but if
[12:18] you can copy that and connect it with
[12:22] like oh like if you're in the Ukraine
[12:24] war zone and you want to flee that
[12:26] country uh they will take your gold and
[12:29] all the things uh from the border, but
[12:31] you can keep your Bitcoin in your brain.
[12:34] You can keep your Bitcoin in in a very
[12:36] small place like on on a on a coin seed
[12:39] phrase and stuff like that. But even if
[12:41] you don't trust that, you can still keep
[12:42] it in your brain or something like that
[12:44] and you make it tangible. I think I
[12:46] think that's where um we more have to go
[12:49] with Bitcoin education uh because all
[12:52] the
[12:52] nerds, most of the nerds already found
[12:55] it like like us. Yep. uh and and now
[12:58] it's about like okay we found the the
[13:00] hardcore 2 three 4% uh of the population
[13:04] and now how can we move from there to 20
[13:08] 30 or 40 or 50% of of adoption and uh we
[13:13] we probably won't do that with finance
[13:16] books. Yeah, exactly. And historically
[13:19] story has been the tool to disseminate
[13:21] information to people too. It's like a
[13:23] really high compression way to distill
[13:25] an idea in a way that's memorable
[13:27] because humans are just intuitively
[13:29] emotional creatures. Like as much as I
[13:30] love to think through things, like we're
[13:32] very much ruled by emotions. So story
[13:34] provides a really unique way to like
[13:36] embed an idea into emotions and
[13:39] hopefully like I can embed the idea of
[13:40] Bitcoin into some of these ones where it
[13:42] really like people have a visceral
[13:44] reaction to it when they're going
[13:45] through this as the character. Yeah, I'm
[13:47] I'm pretty pumped about it. I think it's
[13:49] going to do really well for people that
[13:51] have a little bit of interest but just
[13:52] aren't going to pick up a non-fiction
[13:54] history of economics book. I have one
[13:57] more uh uh question before and there are
[14:00] many question about but have one more
[14:02] specifically about the writing process.
[14:04] Um how do you write so long on one
[14:07] thing? Like it seems like you probably
[14:11] also not only write like long years
[14:13] because you're procrastinating. You're
[14:15] writing every day. So you actually put a
[14:17] lot of work and and uh you seem like a
[14:20] very um organized and disciplined guy.
[14:23] So uh you probably write and like
[14:25] rewrite things and rewrite things and
[14:27] like till it's perfect basically. Uh how
[14:31] how do you do that? And like I think you
[14:34] said like you're on the 24th draft or
[14:36] something like that. Why didn't you just
[14:39] publish the the 12th one or something
[14:41] like that? That's a great question. So,
[14:44] um I think that actually writing a
[14:46] fiction story about Bitcoin has some
[14:47] interesting like mental stuff because
[14:49] like you're constantly seeing the price
[14:50] rise. Like time in Bitcoin is like 10x
[14:53] time in the real world sometimes with
[14:55] how much things are going. There's a lot
[14:57] of Bitcoin books out there right now and
[14:58] I think a lot of them are like rushed to
[15:00] get out because it's like man this thing
[15:01] is going to rip. Like I want to get the
[15:03] book out soon. So, um, it's been really
[15:06] hard to like fight that desire and
[15:08] really embrace the low time preference
[15:10] of Bitcoin. But that was kind of the
[15:11] ethos of this thing where I could have
[15:13] released a version after a year that
[15:15] would have been like an average book,
[15:18] but like that's not what Bitcoin is.
[15:19] It's like I want to create something
[15:21] beautiful for generations from now that
[15:23] is like the best iteration that I
[15:25] possibly can make that people are going
[15:26] to enjoy 5, 10, 20 years from now. Like
[15:28] I don't I don't just want to have
[15:29] technically written a book. I want to
[15:31] make the most beautiful book and piece
[15:33] of art that I possibly can that like
[15:35] follows the low time preference ideals
[15:36] of Bitcoin. So, that's kind of why I've
[15:39] been so uh disciplined and determined to
[15:41] just make it as good as possible. Um,
[15:44] yeah, I very much am wired to do stuff
[15:46] like that, too. I love to throw my
[15:48] entire self at a project and a problem
[15:50] and give it my best. Yeah, absolutely.
[15:54] Will be really fun. And are you planning
[15:56] to releasing it uh 2025 this year? Yep,
[15:59] it'll be released this year. I don't
[16:00] have a formal deadline yet and there's a
[16:01] couple moving pieces based on like my
[16:03] final editing process here and design
[16:05] stuff, but should be this summer. Um,
[16:08] yeah, I really wish I could give you a
[16:09] more concrete date, but like I said,
[16:11] there's a couple things out of my
[16:12] control. Really cool. I mean, uh, you're
[16:14] you're riding since 2022, so it's like a
[16:18] couple more weeks or or one month more,
[16:21] one month less is probably doesn't make
[16:23] a huge difference for you at this point.
[16:25] It eats at me though. Like I I really
[16:28] wanted to release it before $100,000
[16:30] Bitcoin, but yeah, just like I was
[16:31] determined to make sure it was as good
[16:33] as possible first. Like I vividly
[16:34] remember writing what are now like my
[16:36] favorite chapter. I won't like give you
[16:38] too much on it, but like some stuff
[16:39] towards the end of the book that I'm
[16:40] just like really pumped about and proud
[16:41] of. I wrote it at like $17,000 Bitcoin
[16:44] in like early 2022 and I still have been
[16:46] just like refining it, refining it,
[16:48] refining it ever since. But it's been
[16:49] kind of a trip. like Bitcoin can kind of
[16:51] feel lonely sometimes because no one in
[16:53] your personal life maybe has the
[16:55] interest that you do in it. Um, but
[16:57] writing a novel on Bitcoin has been like
[16:58] an additional level of alienating
[17:01] because it's like no one in my life is
[17:03] like interested in reading a fictional
[17:04] Bitcoin novel except all my friends and
[17:07] Twitter and Nster and everything. But
[17:09] um, yeah, it's it's been a trip for
[17:11] sure. I'm excited to be on the other
[17:12] side of it. But I'm also love the
[17:14] process. So it's a mixed bag. Yeah. And
[17:18] I'm I'm sure once you publish it, you
[17:20] will probably start writing the third
[17:22] one. So like it's anyways like it
[17:24] doesn't really matter, right? Yeah,
[17:25] exactly. I like I said, I kind of just
[17:27] fell in love with this process. I I
[17:29] didn't really anticipate to, but I just
[17:30] kind of had taken to my personality and
[17:33] yeah, off to the races. It's also
[17:35] something that I just thought about the
[17:37] the Bitcoin price was at its low. I just
[17:40] checked it up at 16K in in in 2022. So,
[17:45] you've seen while you written the book
[17:48] uh the Bitcoin price going from 16K to
[17:51] 107K or something like that that you had
[17:55] some form in there, I guess. Yeah, I
[17:57] know. And I was like, I really wanted to
[17:58] publish it in more of the bare market,
[18:00] but hey, here we are. H yeah, maybe you
[18:03] can do it for the second market. I'm
[18:07] hoping we'll get it out before that.
[18:08] We'll see. Um let's talk about uh uh I
[18:12] think if you talk about Bitcoin and
[18:14] novels um what do you think is the
[18:17] Bitcoin's role in in in our soci society
[18:20] right now and and what do you foresee
[18:23] Bitcoin's role will be in in in the
[18:26] future. So in the context of like novels
[18:29] and writing like I just find technology
[18:31] endlessly interesting. So it consumes
[18:33] like a huge portion of my lives from
[18:34] hobbies to like writing and everything.
[18:37] Um, I think that technology never
[18:39] evolves in the exact way that we're
[18:41] going to anticipate it. Like things
[18:42] always just like kind of grow and it's
[18:44] like essentially a living life form. And
[18:46] bit Bitcoin to me is like one of the
[18:47] best ever representations of a digital
[18:51] life form that's constantly growing,
[18:53] evolving, adapting in a resilient way to
[18:56] the world acting around it. That's
[18:58] always been like one of the things I
[18:59] find most beautiful about Bitcoin is it
[19:02] mirrors some of the free market
[19:04] structures of life um and some of the
[19:06] anti-fragility things that you see like
[19:09] in forests for example where like
[19:12] forests that um are in green houses that
[19:14] don't have wind the trees don't grow as
[19:17] strong as ones in nature and like
[19:18] Bitcoin constantly like seeing gusts of
[19:20] wind seeing uh like things attack it
[19:24] from the outside just seeing it more
[19:26] resilient and uh how closely Bitcoin
[19:29] mirrors the natural world and is
[19:31] continuing to adapt in front of us is I
[19:33] just think one of the most beautiful
[19:34] things. So it's the role it plays now is
[19:37] will not be the role that it plays into
[19:38] the future. I think it'll keep evolving
[19:40] and it's so hard to predict things like
[19:41] that even though we all try like I have
[19:43] pretty high level of certainty it'll be
[19:45] around in 100 years from now but in what
[19:48] form how it looks it's just so hard to
[19:49] know for sure. Um, the things I'm more
[19:51] certain of is like that it's going to
[19:54] positively impact the world, reduce
[19:57] human incentives for war and stealing
[20:00] and theft from one another. But we'll
[20:02] see thing. Uh, it's it's it's the the
[20:06] topic of what Bitcoin represents is
[20:09] super interesting. when you look like
[20:11] one uh comparison I
[20:14] usually I like to make is the one with
[20:17] the printing press because before the
[20:20] printing press information was
[20:22] controlled
[20:23] by basically the church uh and and was
[20:28] uh very tightly controlled and and there
[20:31] was not a lot of like people couldn't
[20:33] read uh it took ages and ages to get one
[20:38] book copy out there uh and the printing
[20:41] press basically gave the information for
[20:44] for out there way quicker uh and uh
[20:50] impacted society in so many different
[20:52] ways then when you look back at that one
[20:55] moment where you actually have the
[20:57] printing press you're like
[21:00] okay what what will that bring to
[21:02] society that printing press you you you
[21:04] have no clue but then in uh looking back
[21:08] from like I don't know 50 years later
[21:10] you're like oh like printing press was a
[21:12] really important invention in our our
[21:13] lifetime. It brought a lot of
[21:15] interesting things uh to to society and
[21:18] humanity. things that you could not
[21:21] foresee when you just are in there in
[21:24] the first like 5 10 years where the
[21:25] printing press was was was coming up uh
[21:28] of like okay you you need one person to
[21:32] print a book for like I don't know 20
[21:34] years uh oh no you can now print a a
[21:37] book uh within like a short period of
[21:40] time you can print millions of books
[21:42] within in a year uh so that's pretty
[21:46] profound and then when you think about
[21:48] Bitcoin, what what that could represent
[21:51] is uh I'm just fascinated by that
[21:53] because I I think we have no clue what
[21:55] what Bitcoin really can do to to uh our
[21:59] human species. I love that one. I think
[22:01] that is absolutely one of the best
[22:02] analogies for it because you put so much
[22:05] power in the hands of the individual in
[22:06] that instance too where at once you had
[22:09] to go to a singular centralized party
[22:11] who had control of this book who'd often
[22:13] disseminate the information to through
[22:15] their lens and then gave the power to
[22:17] the individual in the exact same way
[22:18] that Bitcoin is giving more power to the
[22:20] individual. No longer do we have to rely
[22:22] on somebody to control our money for us.
[22:24] We can just do it ourselves if we want
[22:26] to. And it makes so like so much more
[22:29] freedom for each one of us, so much more
[22:31] richness and abundance for each one of
[22:32] us. It's really an incredible thing. And
[22:35] to your point, too, it's like you
[22:37] couldn't have
[22:39] totally guessed what was going to happen
[22:41] with that. But for thousands of years,
[22:44] we're still using that tool and it's
[22:45] still making life better for everybody.
[22:47] In the same way, I think Bitcoin will do
[22:49] that, too, where like it it clearly is
[22:52] obviously going to make our lives
[22:53] better. It's made my life so much better
[22:54] already, but it's going to continue to
[22:56] do that for thousands of years in my
[22:57] opinion. Absolutely. Um, what do you
[23:01] think uh is is the connection between uh
[23:03] the the freedom movement and and and
[23:05] Bitcoin? They're more and more finding
[23:07] each other, I feel like. But it's it's
[23:08] it's still like uh there there are
[23:10] freedom fighters out there that say,
[23:12] "Oh, like Bitcoin is is controlled by
[23:14] the CIA and stuff like that." But I
[23:16] think the connection between Bitcoin and
[23:17] freedom is is really interesting. Very
[23:20] much so. I I mean that's one of the
[23:21] things that got me interested in the
[23:23] first place, the Bitcoin. It's just like
[23:24] more freedom for the individual. I think
[23:26] there's a lot of nihilism in the world
[23:28] generally. Um and I think a lot of
[23:30] people even in the freedom movements are
[23:31] very nihilistic. So even though there's
[23:33] this essentially gift in front of them
[23:35] in Bitcoin, this thing that can like
[23:36] make their life better, be a tool for
[23:38] change. They have a hard time seeing
[23:41] that tool for what it is because they're
[23:42] just expecting everything in the world
[23:44] to be terrible and bad. I think that's a
[23:46] lot of it. People being um hesitant to
[23:48] it. But the other part is something we
[23:50] already spoke on with u how much Bitcoin
[23:53] is evolving and like water. It just like
[23:55] adapts and moves around things. Like
[23:58] people have their preconceived notion of
[23:59] what Bitcoin has to be. They think it
[24:01] has to be this kind of money that fits
[24:03] their worldview and then it changes. It
[24:06] adapts. Like a government adopts it,
[24:07] which is weird. Wasn't maybe wasn't what
[24:09] you expected for it, but it's changing.
[24:11] It's still Bitcoin. It's still spitting
[24:13] out blocks every 10 minutes. like just
[24:15] because that wasn't what you thought was
[24:17] going to happen individually doesn't
[24:19] mean it's not okay. Like the system is
[24:21] still working. And I think that has
[24:22] turned a lot of people off. Like uh as
[24:24] this thing has been adopted by
[24:26] corporations and governments, uh a lot
[24:28] of the people that want it to just be
[24:30] peer-to-peer cash are getting more upset
[24:31] about that. But I just think it's I
[24:34] think fantastic. Like it's I I really
[24:36] want to see it have a lot of success as
[24:38] peer-to-peer cash. Like I'm very freedom
[24:39] minded and libertarian myself. Um, but
[24:43] yeah, I would love to see it adapted or
[24:46] adopted by these things because it
[24:47] aligns their incentives so they're not
[24:49] going to be shutting this thing down.
[24:50] Like in the same manner that I think
[24:52] Bitcoin makes my life better, I think it
[24:54] makes governments better, too. Even if
[24:56] it doesn't give them quite as much
[24:57] power.
[24:59] How do you think it it makes governments
[25:00] better?
[25:02] Well, I think it reduces their ability
[25:04] to print money as part of it. Um, I also
[25:06] think it aligns their incentives around
[25:08] Bitcoin where uh like if you don't have
[25:11] any Bitcoin, like I I think like
[25:13] interpersonal level holding Bitcoin kind
[25:15] of starts to force you to see Bitcoin in
[25:17] a different way. Once you told it,
[25:19] you're exposed to the volatility. You
[25:21] see the news about it through a
[25:22] different lens. Like it just literally
[25:24] changes your perception when you're
[25:25] actually using the thing, when you have
[25:26] some skin in the game. Um, governments
[25:29] have the same thing. Like if they are
[25:30] holding Bitcoin, they then have to have
[25:32] staff on this thing. they have to start
[25:34] understanding it more deeply. People
[25:36] involved in the government have to start
[25:37] thinking about Bitcoin. All of which are
[25:39] positive things. I don't love the fact
[25:41] that governments can have huge amounts
[25:42] of Bitcoin um if and when that happens.
[25:45] But it does align their incentives and
[25:47] it does force more of the world and
[25:49] governments to have to understand this
[25:50] thing. So I'm pretty optimistic about
[25:52] that honestly.
[25:54] How do you actually look at uh um like
[25:57] the strate strategic bitcoin reserve uh
[26:00] or even big institutions like a strategy
[26:04] or uh um black rockck and coinbase
[26:06] holding so many of the bitcoin I mean
[26:09] overall actually in individuals hold
[26:11] like most of bitcoin like 70 80% or so
[26:15] or so so of them uh and and institutions
[26:18] don't make that big of a chunk actually
[26:21] um but how do you
[26:23] Look at look at that. Um I think
[26:27] institutions are a collection of
[26:28] individuals. Um it's really easy to see
[26:31] micro strategies like Michael Sailor
[26:32] owning a massive amount of Bitcoin, but
[26:35] like I own some shares in Micro
[26:36] Strategy. If I don't like the direction
[26:38] they're taking with Bitcoin, I'm selling
[26:40] my shares immediately and buying real
[26:41] Bitcoin. Um I think there's an incentive
[26:44] there that often doesn't get thought
[26:46] about in depth. Like it's not just a
[26:49] single holder that has massive power
[26:51] over this. there is somebody we do trust
[26:53] to hold that. But at the end of the day,
[26:55] the shareholders genuinely do have a
[26:57] great deal of power over this and they
[26:59] vote with their Bitcoin and dollars. If
[27:01] they take their economic energy out of
[27:02] Micro Strategy or I I always call it
[27:05] Micro Strategy, it's such a problem. Um
[27:07] it reduces their power. So I'm slightly
[27:09] less concerned about the corporate
[27:10] adoption. I understand more of the
[27:12] concerns around the um government
[27:15] adoption. There's still concerns there
[27:18] for sure. Um because like you can't
[27:19] really you can physically like actually
[27:22] vote vote but I've always felt like the
[27:24] economic vote is slightly more powerful
[27:26] and immediate if you just take your
[27:28] money out of a stock versus a government
[27:30] but I don't know I think I have a lot of
[27:32] faith in Bitcoin. It kind of always has
[27:35] proven to evolve and adapt and grow and
[27:37] I think it'll continue to do that even
[27:38] with governments.
[27:41] Absolutely.
[27:42] I think it will be quite some time till
[27:44] we get used to saying strategy instead
[27:47] of micro strategy. Uh I know I I I still
[27:50] say Twitter. So that that that has been
[27:53] actually quite long since today is not
[27:55] Twitter. Uh but I'm still not used to
[27:57] it. Uh why do you own let's let's
[28:00] practice. Why do you own strategy?
[28:03] Uh, so I know that I think Michael
[28:06] Sailor likes to get away from the term
[28:08] of
[28:10] u what's the word like
[28:13] um attack speculative attack the pier
[28:16] Rashard paper um and he likes to get
[28:18] away from the word speculative attack
[28:21] but that's kind of why I own it like he
[28:22] is functionally performing a speculative
[28:24] attack on the US dollar and he can do it
[28:27] in a way that I just simply cannot I can
[28:29] like take out loans but just not in the
[28:31] same way that he can. he can finance
[28:33] money for essentially zero and use it to
[28:35] buy Bitcoin and in doing so he's
[28:37] actually like
[28:39] expediating other adoption for other
[28:42] companies too and setting this
[28:43] president. So like I just think it's an
[28:45] incredibly interesting story and I like
[28:46] to be at least a little bit part of it.
[28:48] Um I talk about it a lot on Twitter too
[28:50] because I find it endlessly interesting.
[28:52] I went to school for business originally
[28:54] so I kind of enjoy thinking about it
[28:55] analytically like that. But I do think a
[28:57] lot of Bitcoiners and people in the
[28:59] strategy I got that one the strategy
[29:01] space uh get a little too distracted.
[29:04] Like Bitcoin is for sure the actual
[29:06] revolution and where the most important
[29:08] thing. But it's just so interesting too
[29:10] like we're we're finally seeing
[29:12] corporate adoption and how these things
[29:13] are going to compete and grow and
[29:15] strategize versus one another and I just
[29:17] find that so interesting. Wait, you went
[29:19] to business school also?
[29:22] Yeah. Yeah. That's so I I taught myself
[29:26] how to code but I went to business
[29:27] school originally.
[29:29] Interesting. Uh so so so no coding
[29:32] school you taught it yourself because
[29:34] you went to to business school and then
[29:36] you write novels about Bitcoin. Yeah. I
[29:38] was I was very entrepreneurial and
[29:40] towards the end of school I I realized I
[29:42] didn't want to just like get a business
[29:43] degree and try to work at like insurance
[29:46] companies were some of the ones that
[29:47] were hiring a lot. I was like, "No, I
[29:48] want to uh build things that I actually
[29:51] care about and do technology cuz that's
[29:54] always been a love of mine." You're also
[29:56] uh in America, right? Yep. So, you also
[29:59] have to pay quite a lot for for those
[30:02] for those degrees. Oh, it's crazy. Um,
[30:06] so I've taught programming quite a lot,
[30:09] too. Yeah. To like younger people,
[30:11] interns and that kind of thing. And
[30:13] every single time it's just so
[30:15] depressing because you see the monstrous
[30:17] amounts of money they're paying to get
[30:19] these degrees that functionally teach
[30:20] them very little about what programming
[30:22] is actually like in the real world. So
[30:24] yeah, it's a very frustrating uh like
[30:28] thing that I've seen change over time in
[30:30] America. Let's take a break for a moment
[30:32] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[30:35] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:37] watches. Those watches are the most
[30:40] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[30:43] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[30:46] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:49] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:52] watch collections. You have the date of
[30:55] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[30:58] there. And of course, also the block
[31:00] height and which epoch we are currently
[31:03] in. I love the level of detail they put
[31:06] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[31:09] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:11] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[31:14] love those watches so so much. And now,
[31:17] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[31:20] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[31:22] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[31:24] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[31:26] first way is you put it on a hardware
[31:28] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[31:31] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[31:34] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[31:37] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[31:40] if you check out the link in the
[31:42] description, you even get 5% off if you
[31:44] use the code Robin. And the second way
[31:47] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[31:50] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[31:54] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[31:56] They will personalize for you a
[31:59] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[32:01] your individual situation. They will
[32:04] show you how you can secure your own
[32:07] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[32:09] enough. You also have to keep all your
[32:11] devices secure. One topic that is
[32:13] overlooked often is the inheritance
[32:16] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[32:19] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[32:21] a plan for that in place already? And
[32:24] last but not least, if you're in a
[32:26] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[32:28] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[32:31] that, head over to the
[32:34] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:37] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:40] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:43] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:45] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:48] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:50] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:52] the link down in the description of
[32:55] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:57] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:01] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:02] there. I I still
[33:04] cannot like I question a lot of those
[33:08] people here in Austria that go to
[33:10] universities. Uh, and here as an
[33:12] Austrian in Austria, you it's completely
[33:16] free. Like you go to a university,
[33:18] completely free. There's a fee for $30
[33:21] per month per per semester. So $60 or
[33:25] something like that per year, which is
[33:27] nothing, but uh it's it's basically
[33:30] free. You actually in Austria, you kind
[33:32] of get paid to to study uh because you
[33:35] get so many benefits like gym
[33:37] memberships and everything like that.
[33:38] There's always a student uh discount. Uh
[33:41] so in a way, you actually get free
[33:45] education and you get paid in doing so.
[33:48] like heavily subsidized. Um, and even
[33:52] here I'm like like why do you waste your
[33:55] time? Like you you there's certain uh
[33:59] things that obviously you have to learn
[34:01] in university if you really want to do
[34:03] that like you you won't learn you you
[34:06] can maybe get the degree of being a
[34:09] doctor online uh and just study it
[34:12] yourself but it will be very hard for
[34:14] you to actually practice it because
[34:16] people probably won't let you. um uh if
[34:20] you want to be a lawyer or something
[34:22] like that then you probably also have to
[34:24] go through the university process
[34:26] otherwise people won't let you do that
[34:28] even though you probably can learn the
[34:30] same knowledge also online somehow um
[34:34] but outside of that especially for
[34:35] business it's always was interesting
[34:38] people pay like hundreds of thousands of
[34:40] of dollars in America to get a
[34:41] businesses degree if they could just use
[34:44] that money to build a business and
[34:46] probably learn in the first year more
[34:47] about
[34:48] than the degree. Yeah, I could not agree
[34:50] more. It's a travesty that we're
[34:52] encouraging so many people to waste so
[34:54] much time like um like you could
[34:57] literally be putting in proof of work
[34:58] like investing your time into building a
[35:00] real thing in the real world that real
[35:02] value for people and instead we're just
[35:05] sitting in a group of classes like
[35:07] talking about hypothetical problems to
[35:08] solve rather than like get out and do
[35:10] it. And there is so much of that in the
[35:12] world. Um it's like almost a disconnect
[35:15] with free markets too because like
[35:16] there's schools essentially especially
[35:18] the American ones aren't really
[35:20] preparing you for being involved in the
[35:22] free market and capitalistic structures.
[35:24] They're like this other thing that's uh
[35:26] completely oblivious to those things and
[35:29] it's almost doing you a disservice. It's
[35:31] like wasting massive amounts of life to
[35:33] teach you things that aren't real to
[35:35] have you wrote memorize things that
[35:36] you're never going to use the rest of
[35:38] your life. Whereas like if you actually
[35:40] did the thing you care about that you
[35:41] have passion for, you're going to have
[35:43] higher levels of learning efficiency
[35:44] because you're going to be like really
[35:45] into it and you're going to solve real
[35:47] problems for people and have to sol like
[35:49] actually do things right away. And it's
[35:51] just like there's so many structures
[35:53] like this in the world that are just so
[35:56] incentive misaligned. I'm really
[35:58] optimistic that Bitcoin is going to be
[35:59] able to help solve some of them because
[36:01] it's just going to allow more free
[36:03] market competition between things and
[36:04] prevent some of this like government
[36:06] money that's just getting injected into
[36:08] like US schools that's kind of turning
[36:12] them into uh essentially just glorified
[36:15] daycare for both the student and even
[36:18] the teacher sometimes because they're
[36:19] not like real learning institutions
[36:21] anymore. But you uh started university.
[36:24] How long did you do it? Uh, I graduated
[36:27] in like three years. This was 2013 I
[36:29] graduated. So, it's been a little while
[36:31] ago now. Oh, so actually you graduated
[36:34] uh in in within three years. Oh, nice. I
[36:37] I I've only made it for a month in in
[36:39] university. Yeah. I if I had to do it
[36:43] now, I I wouldn't like I I hated the
[36:46] process honestly back then. It made me
[36:48] feel so dumb because like I I genuinely
[36:50] love learning if you can't tell. Like I
[36:51] I like learning about stuff. I like to
[36:53] like improve myself and work on things
[36:55] and going through that process made me
[36:57] just feel stupid. I like I was never
[36:59] good at memorization. Um, but I love
[37:02] creating things and like working hard on
[37:04] stuff, but it almost was
[37:05] counterintuitive. So, after I graduated
[37:07] and when I was teaching myself how to
[37:08] code, uh, it like just reinvigorated me
[37:11] for like a a love of life. I'm like, all
[37:13] right, I can do stuff. I can make
[37:14] things. I can grow. And it really breaks
[37:17] my heart that there's so many younger
[37:18] kids out there that are getting pushed
[37:20] into the school system and just like
[37:23] taking their love of life and their like
[37:25] vibrant consciousness and just crushing
[37:27] it. Like it's a a huge frustration of
[37:31] mine. That's why with with Bitcoin
[37:35] homeschooling is also extremely popular.
[37:37] I mean, I don't have kids myself, so uh
[37:40] but I think if you have the
[37:43] capabilities, the time and and the
[37:45] resources to do it. I think it's uh a
[37:48] great thing what you can do to your kids
[37:50] to to homeschool them or at least like
[37:52] partly homeschool them. Uh
[37:55] to to not crush the the the soul for or
[37:59] the seeness of learning out because if
[38:01] you if you see young kids, they all want
[38:04] to learn like they have so many
[38:05] questions. I have a huge family with
[38:08] like so many kids. Uh, and it's always
[38:11] fascinating when they are small,
[38:13] especially like under seven, under 8
[38:16] years old. They come to you and have
[38:19] 50,000 questions. And I like that
[38:21] because I like to speak a lot. Uh, and
[38:23] and then I I answer all of them in
[38:26] hours. But uh at at some point we we
[38:30] stop asking questions for some reason
[38:32] because like oh you sit down be silent
[38:34] and then don't ask too many stupid
[38:36] questions. Uh that's kind of the the
[38:38] school system uh kind of drives that out
[38:41] of us and all of the sudden there can be
[38:44] uh you're punished if you say something
[38:46] wrong which is fascinating because like
[38:49] if you say something wrong there's a
[38:51] possibility to learn that and not a
[38:53] punishment of like oh like you did
[38:54] something wrong there. school system
[38:56] would be a whole another
[38:58] podcast for me. Um, uh, really
[39:02] interesting. It's also one thing that I
[39:03] want to note in there is also the
[39:05] Bitcoin community is pretty cool with
[39:07] with that Bitcoin is hope, you know,
[39:10] like you you see it in all the
[39:12] Bitcoiners because you said it before
[39:14] with the the freedom people where you
[39:16] see that uh people are a little bit
[39:20] pessimistic or they they look at things
[39:22] very skeptical. uh with Bitcoiners they
[39:26] also question a lot but they have that
[39:28] hope they have that like positive vision
[39:31] for for for the future and that that's
[39:33] something really really big in in
[39:34] Bitcoin which makes me proud to be in
[39:37] that community honestly very much so and
[39:40] I felt it in my own life too you were
[39:41] just messaging or mentioning children uh
[39:45] like I had a kid about a year and a half
[39:47] ago and Bitcoin was instrumental to that
[39:49] like I had so much more financial hope
[39:51] for my family that I I there was so much
[39:55] more optimism around the world that I
[39:57] was going to be having a child in and
[39:59] like I I genuinely do attribute Bitcoin
[40:01] to a big part of that.
[40:03] That's amazing. So for you um there
[40:07] there was this aspect in you that said
[40:10] like okay uh I I can have a kid because
[40:14] uh I have Bitcoin and because I have a
[40:17] positive outlook on the world uh both
[40:20] broadly but also on on myself with
[40:22] finances. Is that that what you're
[40:24] saying? Exactly. Yeah. Uh it definitely
[40:27] made financial things easier. Um, but on
[40:29] top of that, like there's so much more
[40:31] hope for the future of like things are
[40:34] going to get better. I have a route to
[40:35] have them have a better life where I
[40:38] have quite a few acquaintances right now
[40:39] that have children but have no hope for
[40:42] the future of that for that child. They
[40:43] think it's just going to get worse and
[40:45] worse and worse and the world's going to
[40:46] get worse and like I can really imagine
[40:48] if you get into that kind of mindset why
[40:50] you wouldn't want to have children. Like
[40:52] if you genuinely do think that the
[40:54] world's going to be getting worse every
[40:55] year, of course you wouldn't want to
[40:56] have children. I feel the opposite. I
[40:58] think that not everybody is going to
[41:00] have their life get better every single
[41:01] year, but Bitcoiners sure as hell are
[41:03] like we have this way of hope and
[41:06] abundance for each one of us and like we
[41:08] have the ability to instill that in our
[41:09] children as well. I'm just so thankful
[41:12] and fortunate for that. Um, and it's
[41:15] part of the reason I wanted to write
[41:16] this book, too. It's like I I really
[41:17] like feel so much gratitude for this
[41:19] network and for the people in this
[41:21] network that I want to at least do my
[41:23] part in giving back to it. And I know
[41:25] you can relate like you're doing this
[41:26] podcast for similar reasons.
[41:29] It it's so interesting um because if you
[41:32] think about what what Bitcoin can do for
[41:35] for your own personal life, it's also
[41:37] the the cultural impact that that it
[41:40] that it will have is is yeah, it's just
[41:42] amazing to to think about. That's that's
[41:45] really cool to to see uh and on having
[41:48] kids. And it's also like almost a
[41:50] Bitcoiner Bitcoiner thing. Oh, that's
[41:52] what I uh that's what I uh was thinking
[41:54] about. Um imagine when we're now having
[41:58] the the Bitcoiner having more and more
[41:59] kids, the Bitcoiner being really
[42:01] positive on on the future. Uh and on the
[42:04] same time, we have the kind of feared
[42:06] mindset and they're like, "Oh, we don't
[42:07] want to have kids in the world." To some
[42:10] degree, that's just natural selection.
[42:12] Like those who are hopeful and and good
[42:15] and and positive about the future, they
[42:18] reproduce themselves. uh and those who
[42:20] don't don't. And that's also like almost
[42:24] part of life. But it it it it makes me
[42:27] makes me sad when when someone says
[42:29] like, "Oh, I don't want to have kids
[42:30] like because I don't have a positive
[42:32] outlook on on the world." And I'm like,
[42:34] "Really?" Like what what what's so bad
[42:36] around right now? Like look look at life
[42:40] 200 years ago. Mhm.
[42:42] The if you describe the life that we're
[42:45] living right now to someone from 200
[42:48] years ago, they would be like, "What?"
[42:50] Like, you're living in the future. Like,
[42:52] it's so crazy. The the an
[42:57] anass guy right now is living better
[43:00] than the richest guy 200 years ago. He
[43:03] can literally like most of the people
[43:05] that are listening to this podcast can
[43:07] probably book a a plane ticket tomorrow
[43:10] and go on another continent tomorrow if
[43:13] they really wanted
[43:14] to. This this this was not a possibility
[43:18] for the richest man uh like hundreds of
[43:21] years ago which is crazy to think about
[43:23] how far we have come and then to say oh
[43:26] this world is going south and and I
[43:28] don't like that's just ridiculous. you
[43:30] you're just you're just trying to find
[43:32] excuses at that point. Absolutely. And
[43:35] this is one of the reasons I'm so
[43:36] passionate about like technology and
[43:37] wanting to write about it because I
[43:39] think there's like a large group of
[43:40] people that I see that are really
[43:41] depressed by technology evolving. They
[43:44] see AI tools. They see things like
[43:46] Bitcoin and they're like, "All right,
[43:47] well now we're going to lose all of our
[43:48] jobs. The world's going to get worse."
[43:50] Or now that there's this digital form of
[43:52] money, like the government's going to
[43:53] use it and make my life worse.
[43:55] Like that's why I think technology is so
[43:57] interesting because uh people can
[43:59] approach it in such different ways. Some
[44:01] people use it as a tool to like have
[44:03] more fear in their life to be more
[44:05] anxious and make their life worse. But
[44:07] it is absolutely a tool that can be used
[44:09] to make your life better if you're
[44:11] willing to be open-minded, understand
[44:12] it, use it, learn it, grow. Um and I
[44:16] just like I don't think that'll ever not
[44:17] be the case. Like humans are completely
[44:19] intertwined with technology from
[44:21] printing presses like you mentioned
[44:23] earlier to like the wheel. Um like these
[44:25] things are all forms of technology and
[44:27] at every turn they've made life better.
[44:29] Like there might be some volatility so
[44:31] to speak in like the like it might have
[44:34] weird side effects in the world but like
[44:37] this mindset of having new technology
[44:39] and then being thinking it's going to
[44:42] make your life worse is just such a
[44:44] toxic thing. I just don't think it
[44:45] serves you. And I think it's just a
[44:47] really positive thing that we need to
[44:48] keep trying to spread with the world. It
[44:52] doesn't serve you and more importantly
[44:54] it doesn't serve the people around you
[44:56] and uh that that that's that's what's
[45:00] the important thing. Um I'm curious uh
[45:02] besides kids what what has how has
[45:06] Bitcoin impacted you personally? Yeah,
[45:08] the kids thing is one big one for sure.
[45:10] Um, uh, proof of work as a concept in
[45:14] everything has been one too. Like I
[45:17] mentioned earlier, the amount of work
[45:19] involved in writing and the low time
[45:21] preference. I kind of hadn't known that
[45:23] lesson before, but Bitcoin just really
[45:25] instilled that for whatever reason, like
[45:27] that super long-term mindset, slowly
[45:30] investing in your future and having a
[45:31] long-term vision. Bitcoin's really
[45:33] increased my desire to do that kind of
[45:35] thing. partly because the financial
[45:37] flexibility, but also like yeah, like
[45:40] just seeing that pattern over and over
[45:42] again of how much work you do in the
[45:44] real world is how much results you get.
[45:47] Um, so I've really I feel like I've
[45:49] changed in that manner because of
[45:51] Bitcoin.
[45:52] Have you also
[45:55] um mess around with altcoins and stocks
[45:58] and and and stuff like that because you
[46:00] have been to business schools and you
[46:02] have learned how to diversify? Not as
[46:04] much as you might think. I when I went
[46:06] to business school, I was into reading
[46:08] like um like the intelligent investor
[46:11] kind of thing, like Benjamin Graham
[46:13] style investing uh paradigms. Um and
[46:17] yeah, I just I didn't have any exposure
[46:19] to Bitcoin uh back in those early days
[46:21] of school. I would have loved it had I
[46:24] probably seen more of it. But no, I I
[46:27] was much more interested in um like
[46:30] starting your own business and that kind
[46:31] of stuff is why I was going there
[46:32] initially and just like building things
[46:34] that kind of thing which I still very
[46:36] much am. It's it's still um like
[46:39] building your own business, building
[46:41] your own knowledge
[46:43] is is the only two things that is
[46:48] probably a better return of investment
[46:50] long-term than Bitcoin. So that that
[46:53] that's the only two things that I'm like
[46:55] uh if you want to diversify, yeah,
[46:57] invest something in your knowledge and
[46:59] maybe in your own business that you
[47:01] start and and control 100% uh and and
[47:04] not uh where you have a tiny fraction on
[47:07] the Apple stock or something like that.
[47:10] Ironically, I've learned way more about
[47:11] how the stock market works and options
[47:14] and all those things from micro strategy
[47:16] or strategy stock um than anything
[47:18] because like I owned some shares of it,
[47:21] wanted to understand this thing more
[47:22] deeply and I kept kept hearing Sor talk
[47:24] about how volatility is vitality and
[47:26] like it sent me on a rabbit hole
[47:28] spending like hundreds and hundreds of
[47:29] hours just researching these things and
[47:31] I had almost no I had like two classes
[47:33] on them in all of my college and of
[47:35] course just like having passion and
[47:37] wanting to learn about something in my
[47:39] opinion It just nets better education
[47:41] results than being forced to sit in a
[47:42] classroom and memorize some things.
[47:44] Crazy how that kind of happened. Yeah,
[47:47] it's but it's a good thing like stepping
[47:49] your toes in because I remember I was a
[47:53] stock pro before Bitcoin uh and I was uh
[47:56] into a lot of different technology
[47:58] stocks. I even like during COVID I I
[48:01] traded Uber stock. It was actually
[48:04] really successful honestly.
[48:05] There were weeks where I just made like
[48:07] five grand or 10 grand because I saw a
[48:10] conference call and I was like, "Oh,
[48:12] that's really bullish." Put some money
[48:13] in there and like one week later it shot
[48:15] up 60%. But um how this all started was
[48:20] I was like, I want to own stocks. This
[48:22] is was like ah I want to try it out. And
[48:23] I was at a time at a McDonald's and I
[48:26] just bought McDonald's stock as my first
[48:28] stock. Didn't know at all what I was
[48:30] doing. Uh but McDonald's was the stock
[48:34] um where I learned everything about what
[48:38] the PE ratios are, what the earnings per
[48:41] share is, like what what are those
[48:43] metrics uh looking like. I listen to the
[48:45] calls and did everything. So like just
[48:48] owning that stock was extremely
[48:51] uh educational for me. Uh and also funny
[48:54] enough before I started now my own
[48:57] business in in with with with that
[49:00] podcast uh a year ago I had some
[49:04] business class and also some tax classes
[49:06] and I was I was like oh I don't know
[49:08] like value added tax like what is that
[49:10] like I don't care now because I have
[49:13] that official business in Austria I have
[49:15] to learn about those taxes and now I
[49:17] have a really great incentive to learn
[49:18] about those things and now I really know
[49:20] like what is value added tax in Austria
[49:23] and and and and and why it's here. I
[49:25] mean, I don't agree why it's here, but I
[49:27] know why it's here and all all the those
[49:31] things. Uh and so I'm a I'm a big
[49:34] proponent of tinkering around with
[49:36] things and actually tipping your toe in
[49:38] there uh and learning that way. That's
[49:41] why I also tell everyone who wants to
[49:44] learn about Bitcoin, like buy some like
[49:46] go on an exchange, put a $100 in there,
[49:50] buy yourself some some cold wallet
[49:53] somehow. Uh, put it on there and just
[49:56] invest that let's say $300 in your
[49:59] knowledge about Bitcoin, then you can
[50:01] talk about it. Uh, and if you still
[50:04] don't like it, then yeah, then then you
[50:05] lost $300. But this might be the biggest
[50:08] financial revolution ever. you should at
[50:10] least know about it a little bit. It's
[50:12] crazy how few people are willing to like
[50:14] do that tiny little investment in
[50:15] themselves too. Just like the tiniest
[50:17] bit of uh time and money could change
[50:20] your entire life. And because of the
[50:22] fiat system and how much we're just on
[50:24] this hamster wheel of constantly barely
[50:26] keeping up because our money is melting,
[50:28] people don't have the time to do that
[50:30] kind of um curiosity uh exploration and
[50:34] learning in their free time that they
[50:35] may be used to. And it's on every level.
[50:39] Um
[50:40] um because because we talked about
[50:43] strategy B and and and Michael was on my
[50:46] podcast also. Um Michael Sailor said
[50:49] publicly um when he talked about his
[50:52] orange pilling story uh that he never
[50:54] questioned what is money. Uh so it's
[50:56] it's not just uh like people that have
[50:59] to be in the rat race and and and and
[51:01] and they they don't have the time to
[51:03] read books. Obviously, Michael Sailor
[51:05] read a lot. Like, he was really like he
[51:07] he's Yeah, I think he's the smartest guy
[51:10] that I've ever met in person. I think
[51:12] that's I don't think I've ever met
[51:14] someone smarter than him in person. Uh
[51:17] so him saying look I never really
[51:20] question what is money and uh he has
[51:23] billions of dollars he he's really
[51:25] wealthy he's really successful he knows
[51:27] the fiat system so good on an
[51:30] operational level and how to use it but
[51:33] still uh only questions with Bitcoin
[51:36] what is money and and and uh why are we
[51:39] using that that that fiat money uh which
[51:43] is super fascinating that it's not just
[51:46] that uh struggling single mom uh in in
[51:49] the neighborhood, but it's also your
[51:51] random billionaire that actually never
[51:54] ask that question. It's incredible.
[51:57] Yeah, we're we're so grateful to have
[51:59] him. Like it's he makes a huge
[52:01] difference in the world and he's been
[52:02] instrumental in my orange pilling
[52:03] journey, too. Absolutely. To me, too. Uh
[52:07] really cool. It was an amazing talk
[52:08] already. Uh Mike, I could talk so much
[52:11] longer about about that topic. um uh we
[52:14] we drifted uh from from Bitcoin to to to
[52:18] writing and about so many other things.
[52:20] Um I'm curious what what can we learn
[52:23] from you be besides Bitcoin? That's a
[52:25] question that asks each and every one of
[52:27] my guests. Uh well, we've already talked
[52:29] about a bunch of my hobbies, but one of
[52:30] my all-time favorite ones is that I'm
[52:32] literally a Brazilian jiu-jitsu
[52:33] instructor. Um I've been doing that for
[52:35] quite a long time, too. Um nice. It's a
[52:38] totally different thing, completely
[52:39] unrelated, although there's a ton of
[52:40] martial artists in Bitcoin in general.
[52:43] Um uh but anyway, the that would be
[52:46] something I would highly recommend for
[52:48] people that uh have ever had any
[52:50] interest in it. It doesn't have to be
[52:51] jiu-jitsu or whatever, but some kind of
[52:54] physical pursuit that you get better at
[52:57] defending yourself is just a it's
[52:59] basically like one of the closest things
[53:00] a human being can attain to a
[53:02] superpower. That's something I teach a
[53:04] couple times a week, that kind of thing.
[53:05] I've been doing that for a while, too.
[53:07] That's amazing. It's it's something that
[53:09] I actually want to uh get into. Uh I had
[53:13] um Kenneth Florian and uh I forgot his
[53:18] name, Renato Mo had on. Uh those two had
[53:22] on and and after that I really felt
[53:24] motivated to to get into some sort of
[53:28] martial arts. Uh I always made sports
[53:30] like I always since like I'm 3 years old
[53:32] I did sports. Um uh now I'm just do a
[53:36] mix of running and swimming uh which is
[53:39] amazing but uh actually I always wanted
[53:42] to do some martial arts and now actually
[53:44] with my new apartment there's like a a
[53:47] martial art thing uh right around the
[53:49] corner like I go out in 2 minutes is
[53:51] right there. I walk there by almost
[53:53] every day and they have this glass
[53:55] windows you you can actually look into
[53:57] what they're doing. Something that I I
[53:59] definitely have to to to try. What what
[54:01] would you recommend in starting is the
[54:03] martial arts style that you would would
[54:05] would say like or start with that one.
[54:07] It's it's it's the best one to start
[54:08] with. Uh jiujitsu is definitely the best
[54:10] one. Although I'm slightly biased. Um
[54:13] especially if you're if you feel like
[54:14] you're wired at all like Robin or any
[54:16] like engineering or anything like that,
[54:18] jiu-jitsu is probably the most intense
[54:19] problem solving of all of them. Um, and
[54:22] it's really in the spirit of what a lot
[54:24] of martial arts are where like a smaller
[54:26] person can genuinely beat up a bigger
[54:28] person, which is just a really cool
[54:30] thing. Um, there's also just no kind of
[54:33] physical exercise like it. You're can
[54:36] train extremely hard, like 100% or
[54:39] really close to it in a way where you're
[54:41] not going to get concussions or get
[54:43] hurt. Um, and it's yeah, it's just so
[54:46] much fun. I I'd ever found a more fun
[54:47] form of exercise that flexes both your
[54:49] mental, trying to um like just combine
[54:53] sets of moves and learn new patterns,
[54:55] but also physical. And I it's just good
[54:57] for the brain genuinely. And I've I've
[55:00] met very few people that have tried it
[55:02] that don't genuinely enjoy it. Is it
[55:05] also the least riskiest of of them all?
[55:08] Uh, very much so in the sense of like
[55:10] you're never going to get hit in the
[55:11] head or very very rarely because it's
[55:13] all like joint submissions and control
[55:15] and chokes and that kind of thing which
[55:18] there's very little risk of getting hurt
[55:20] that way. I've been doing it for 9 years
[55:22] and like almost no injuries. Yeah. Ah
[55:26] that's that's great to hear. like uh
[55:28] obviously any physical activity is
[55:31] always connected with possibilities of
[55:34] injuries and swimming is is one of the
[55:36] least riskers in that but I I still hurt
[55:39] my shoulder. Uh so so even if swimming
[55:43] some things can happen. Um really cool
[55:45] we have uh and and it's actually very
[55:47] fun question. Maybe we can talk almost a
[55:50] little bit long on that but we have
[55:51] ended in the podcast where the previous
[55:53] guest is asking a question for the next
[55:55] guest without knowing who the next guest
[55:56] actually is. And your question from the
[55:58] previous guest is if human colonizes
[56:01] Mars um how can Bitcoin achieve
[56:05] multiplanetary functionality? Oh man,
[56:08] that's a fun one. Um so I don't exactly
[56:10] know on how long uh like lightyear wise
[56:14] it takes for information to get from
[56:16] Earth to Mars and I'm sure that'll be a
[56:18] technical innovation that needs to be
[56:19] solved.
[56:21] But like it's clearly going to work
[56:24] better than fiat to use Bitcoin between
[56:27] Mars and the Earth. Um I've heard some
[56:29] pretty decent proposals before where
[56:31] essentially we need to have some kind of
[56:32] like shared state or a duplicate version
[56:35] of Bitcoin. I don't know if I like that
[56:37] idea as much as just having a singular
[56:39] Bitcoin and then having some kind of
[56:40] layer that lets us communicate between
[56:42] Mars and Earth. So we have a certain
[56:44] dedicated amount of SATs on Mars as
[56:46] people move in and out of Mars and onto
[56:48] Earth. Um, I think it's a really fun
[56:50] problem to solve and I think it's so
[56:52] obvious that like Bitcoin is clearly the
[56:53] best tool for the job. Um, how that
[56:57] affects mining and stuff, I'm not
[56:59] exactly sure, but I mean, I'd imagine by
[57:01] the time that humans make their way to
[57:03] Mars, we've
[57:04] like the block subsidy is pretty darn
[57:07] low and Bitcoin has become so um just
[57:10] ingrained in the world that it
[57:13] doesn't matter quite as much like if
[57:16] Martians are mining as well. But who
[57:18] knows? Yeah, I don't know. That's that's
[57:20] a fun question though.
[57:23] And and it's and it's I'm I'm very
[57:26] positive that we will solve that because
[57:28] it's a technical problem and if we can
[57:31] figure out uh how to get humans in in
[57:37] in such amounts to mass that it actually
[57:40] makes sense to also use their own
[57:43] currency there. So, Bitcoin um then we
[57:46] can also figure out how to use Bitcoin
[57:48] on Mars. I think I think bringing humans
[57:52] to Mars is more complicated than using
[57:55] Bitcoin on Mars. Exactly. Yeah. It could
[57:59] have to be some side chain kind of thing
[58:01] or some dedicated like federated model
[58:04] to communicate between both Mars and
[58:06] Earth. And I'm not positive. That is a
[58:08] fun one though. I agree with what you
[58:09] said where if we can figure out how to
[58:11] get there, it's going to be really easy
[58:12] to figure out how to get Bitcoin to work
[58:14] uh even across the long distances.
[58:16] The Mass Federation, I love
[58:19] that. Really cool. Thank you so much,
[58:22] Michael. Um uh for for being on. Um
[58:25] before I let you go, um where can people
[58:27] find you, ask you questions. Oh, and uh
[58:30] when your book comes out, just let me
[58:32] know so we can link it in the
[58:34] description so people that listen to
[58:35] this now in the future might already can
[58:38] check it out. Love that. Uh the best
[58:40] place to find me is for sure on
[58:42] Twitterx, whatever you like to call it.
[58:44] Um just Michael R. Sullivan over there
[58:47] or Sully Michael. I'm sure you'll post
[58:48] the link. That's the best place to find
[58:50] me. Feel free to hit me up, message me.
