[00:00] cbdcs were actually created as a direct
[00:03] response to bitcoin dangerous times are
[00:05] ahead in fact I'll tell you what started
[00:07] in Turkey Bitcoin uh Will Keep Us Safe I
[00:11] always like to start the conversation
[00:14] with bitcoiners on one specific note uh
[00:17] and a note who it's always different to
[00:21] each bitcoiner and each B uh but there
[00:25] are some similarities and the question
[00:27] is why are you on bitcoin why is it
[00:31] exciting for you what is interesting for
[00:33] you in Bitcoin good question good
[00:36] question um to be honest with you the
[00:38] first time I heard about Bitcoin was
[00:40] back in 2008 so 2008 2010 and and it was
[00:46] towards the end of 2010 I do remember it
[00:49] clearly because that was um when my
[00:51] daughter was born and she just come home
[00:53] from hospital and it was on TV I
[00:55] remember hearing it I remember
[00:58] seeing Bitcoin on TV and I can't
[01:00] remember it was like $5 $7 what whatever
[01:03] it was and every now and then I used to
[01:06] you know hear about it uh but I was
[01:09] actually introduced to not Bitcoin
[01:13] believe it or not but
[01:15] crypto uh by someone I used to know
[01:19] about two years ago
[01:20] now and um I
[01:23] was you know like many others I ended up
[01:27] buying um I don't know ethereum Solana
[01:31] cardano and all that kind of stuff but
[01:34] luckily um I did all that stuff and then
[01:37] I was on Twitter already um I don't know
[01:40] I can't remember I think I typed like
[01:42] crypto or Bitcoin or something and um I
[01:45] ended up uh in one of these
[01:47] spaces um and I'll tell you I
[01:50] spent literally four maybe five days in
[01:54] that space listening to people and um
[01:58] after the fifth day I ended up selling
[02:01] everything that I had all the um you
[02:03] know altcoins or you know ethereum
[02:06] Solana whatever I had and even after
[02:09] five days I lost money on that on on
[02:10] those um coins believe it or not anyway
[02:13] after five days I sold them all and I
[02:16] bought Bitcoin um but what it was it
[02:19] wasn't the explanation of Bitcoin that
[02:22] did it for me it was the explanation of
[02:24] Fiat money that convinced me to buy you
[02:28] know to buy Bitcoin
[02:30] um now I own my own business um and I've
[02:34] been in business for about 22 years now
[02:36] so I deal with people every day I deal
[02:39] with money every day and I always knew
[02:42] something was wrong with fat money but I
[02:45] just didn't know what it was I couldn't
[02:46] put my finger on
[02:48] it um but after after I learned what I
[02:51] learned about Fiat money yeah I you know
[02:55] straight I bought Bitcoin and when it
[02:58] comes to bitcoin it was that basic idea
[03:03] that captured um that captured me
[03:06] actually it was you know decentralized
[03:10] you know Bitcoin is decentralized it's
[03:12] um you know unconfiscatable it's
[03:14] independent no one can do anything about
[03:16] it you can't you know it can't be taken
[03:18] away from you and I was so amazed and
[03:21] that is how my Bitcoin Journey started
[03:25] and um along the way you know um I met
[03:30] many people I learned um a lot of stuff
[03:32] and I'll tell
[03:34] you that journey of learning never ends
[03:37] when it comes to bitcoin I am still
[03:39] learning like um like everybody else I
[03:42] am still learning so um but what I think
[03:47] it is that you know that thing about
[03:50] Bitcoin it is unconfiscatable no one can
[03:52] take it away from you and Bitcoin is the
[03:57] only thing that you can truly own
[04:00] now that is something for me and that is
[04:03] what I follow really oh wow uh that's a
[04:06] great explanation you heard yeah the
[04:08] Bitcoin first when you were in 2010
[04:12] coming home from your daughter's birth I
[04:14] like that story yes um but actually um
[04:19] back in 2018 and and I'll tell you this
[04:22] is um a little mistake a lot of plebs
[04:26] made now back in 2018 I was actually
[04:28] talking to um my cousin um he lives in
[04:31] Canada and he's a computer engineer I
[04:34] remember 2018 we were on you know
[04:37] talking on the phone and he mentioned
[04:40] Bitcoin so you know back then I didn't
[04:43] know anything about it and I said to him
[04:46] that I didn't really understand Bitcoin
[04:47] and I can't remember how much Bitcoin
[04:50] was at the time say about I don't know
[04:51] 12,000 15,000 whatever it was so I said
[04:55] to him that I don't really understand
[04:57] Bitcoin and I don't have $112,000 you
[04:59] know to buy Bitcoin and this is what he
[05:03] said to me oh don't worry about it then
[05:05] just forget it instead of saying that if
[05:08] it had said to me you know what no you
[05:10] don't have to pay 12,000 and get a whole
[05:14] Bitcoin you can actually you know buy a
[05:16] little percentage of it and that's how
[05:19] you know that's how you can start but he
[05:20] never said that to
[05:22] me so I mean I could have been in
[05:25] Bitcoin since 2018 so I'd like to say to
[05:29] all pleds out there if anyone if you try
[05:31] to Orangeville and that is probably the
[05:34] um um that is where you know normal
[05:38] people get confused I mean how much is
[05:40] Bitcoin at the moment what is it 42
[05:43] $43,000 a lot of people think that they
[05:45] have to pay $43,000 to buy Bitcoin no
[05:50] please do explain it to people they
[05:52] don't have to you can buy a little
[05:54] percentage of it what I don't know $10
[05:57] 20 $50 $100 whatever you have you can do
[05:59] it that way so make sure you say this to
[06:04] uh like normal people then they get it
[06:06] then they get it yeah it's it's still
[06:08] amazing how how much people how many
[06:11] people think that Bitcoin is expensive
[06:14] just because one Bitcoin is like 40,000
[06:17] EUR but if you you always have to take
[06:20] in account how many are there like it's
[06:23] like they they only look at the one unit
[06:27] price and that's why also the those [ __ ]
[06:29] coins like Sho Dogecoin and stuff like
[06:32] that they're like oh Bitcoin is and
[06:35] Dogecoin is like
[06:36] at yeah three cents and if they only go
[06:40] to like 50 cents uh wow that would be
[06:43] such an amazing game and but they don't
[06:46] realize if those like and and it's
[06:50] actually amazing that this this this
[06:54] thinking is all all in the head like I
[06:58] cannot
[07:03] is yeah but even in the Fiat World there
[07:06] are stocks and stocks uh you also have
[07:09] to look at how many outstanding stocks
[07:12] like I watch Tesla stock uh back in the
[07:15] days uh before I I got into Bitcoin and
[07:19] they did uh I think three stock splits
[07:23] and it was crazy to see that people buy
[07:27] into a stock just because they do stock
[07:29] split because the stock gets cheaper and
[07:31] the stock does not get cheaper they are
[07:33] just splitting the stocks they getting
[07:36] twice as many stocks and the price
[07:38] halfes like this this is yeah this this
[07:41] not this does nothing for the business
[07:44] and nowadays you can also buy half a
[07:47] stock and percentag of a stock so it
[07:49] does not matter it's the same with
[07:51] Bitcoin and yeah it's uh this is one
[07:54] fact I cannot believe that I still
[07:57] encountered that uh kind of thinking
[08:00] when I speak with people about Bitcoin
[08:02] yeah yeah but is it isn't it amazing
[08:05] Bitcoin is um I mean it's not like
[08:07] stocks and shares I don't know H funds
[08:10] and whatever you know all that all that
[08:11] kind of complicated stuff
[08:14] Bitcoin um even if you don't know
[08:17] anything I mean imagine you know
[08:20] buying just I don't know whatever just
[08:23] half a Bitcoin just one Bitcoin and you
[08:25] don't even need to know anything about
[08:27] it just put in your C cold wallet and
[08:30] then hudle just wait and that's it it
[08:33] will take care of itself you know
[08:36] because um a lot of Traders they those
[08:38] people don't sleep do they they just
[08:40] spend their lives in front of the um you
[08:42] know computer screen but Bitcoin is not
[08:45] like that Bitcoin actually yeah gives
[08:47] you that
[08:49] freedom just store it on your cold you
[08:52] know cold wallet and just wait that's it
[08:54] that's all you have to do that's all you
[08:55] have to
[08:57] do yeah this and hle like this is it's
[09:01] so
[09:02] easy yeah you have been
[09:06] in you have been in business you say uh
[09:09] 22 years did 22 years some of your
[09:13] experience in business and dealing with
[09:15] money maybe more in other ways than
[09:19] people that are just employed or people
[09:20] that are doing other stuff did anything
[09:23] help you to understand Bitcoin uh in
[09:27] understanding the value of it 100% and
[09:30] I'll tell you that still that I am still
[09:33] learning things every day but one thing
[09:36] I know um I'll give you an example and I
[09:39] felt this like in the last 22 years as
[09:41] long as I've been in this business I
[09:43] felt this all the time and that's what I
[09:45] was saying to you earlier I always knew
[09:48] something was wrong with Fiat money now
[09:52] you know since I've been involved in
[09:54] involved in Bitcoin yet I understand it
[09:56] much better now there is this particular
[09:59] um equipment that I use and I have to
[10:03] replace it every year a year and a half
[10:06] or something right
[10:09] now I think it was like about a year and
[10:12] a half ago I paid
[10:14] £380 for this um equipment right and
[10:19] then a year and a half ago that was and
[10:21] then couple of months ago I bought the
[10:23] same thing look from
[10:26] £380 it went up to £620
[10:30] okay now this is
[10:33] inflation this is
[10:35] inflation at its worst I mean we're not
[10:38] talking about you know 2% 5% 10% you
[10:43] know so things like that um and and and
[10:46] I come I come across things like that
[10:49] every single day you can't really uh oh
[10:53] you can fight against um Fiat money and
[10:57] that's Bitcoin that's how you do it
[10:59] everything else is just irrelevant
[11:01] really and you also said that from
[11:04] crypto to bitcoin feat brought you like
[11:07] the problem of feed money what what do
[11:10] you mean exactly with it like what you
[11:13] what you talking
[11:14] about I mean look
[11:17] um I know a lot of people and they're in
[11:21] crypto not Bitcoin crypto and when I say
[11:25] Fiat mind what what I mean is they buy
[11:28] stuff say I don't know for $101 pound
[11:31] whatever as soon as they make a little
[11:35] profit it goes up to 12 pound or $12
[11:38] they sell it for that little profit that
[11:40] 20 uh 20% profit so they go back to uh
[11:45] the Fiat money again now this is what I
[11:47] don't understand and I don't recommend
[11:49] it to anyone Bitcoin Traders now Bitcoin
[11:53] is one asset that you can truly own in
[11:57] this world right and and if we're
[11:59] talking
[12:00] about I don't know Bitcoin gaining value
[12:03] right and it will it is valuable already
[12:07] but in terms of Fiat money it will go up
[12:09] to I know it's it's you know it will go
[12:11] up you know forever Lura as as um you
[12:14] know Michael Sal say it will go up
[12:16] forever but if I have one Bitcoin and
[12:19] say I bought it today at
[12:22] 42,000 right why would I want to sell it
[12:26] when it goes up to say 50 or 50 if I say
[12:29] $60,000 why would I want to sell it and
[12:31] go back to that you know Fiat money
[12:34] system why do I want to do that why
[12:35] would I want to do that no Bitcoin I'm
[12:38] keeping it I'm definitely keeping it I'm
[12:41] not going back to that Fiat system and
[12:44] you were born in in Turkey right yes I
[12:47] was born in Turkey
[12:51] yeah did this uh influence like when you
[12:56] I feel sometimes when you uh in the
[12:59] Western World with a maximum inflation
[13:02] of 10 20% uh maybe you don't notice it
[13:05] with the supermarket prices your salary
[13:07] gets improved every year you are in a
[13:11] good country that has not that kind of
[13:14] crazy inflation I think some of like
[13:17] most of the people find Bitcoin as a
[13:20] luxury product as a luxury asset and uh
[13:24] they don't understand what Bitcoin
[13:27] actually means did
[13:29] that you had strong Connections in
[13:32] Turkey you were born in Turkey did this
[13:35] influence your thinking about Bitcoin
[13:37] and and maybe you can explain how very
[13:41] good question yes definitely definitely
[13:43] 100% um and now as you say you know I
[13:46] live in England and I've been I've been
[13:47] living here for 30 years now
[13:50] um but um I've got strong Connections in
[13:54] turkey and I go to Turkey um yeah every
[13:57] year and I was there uh um just two
[14:00] three months ago during the
[14:03] summer I got to Turkey and in the first
[14:07] 10 days fuel you know petrol prices
[14:10] increased three times in 10
[14:14] days this is how bad things
[14:17] are
[14:19] now um I have
[14:23] actually prepared some notesy about
[14:26] turkey this is how bad things are and
[14:27] this is why tur turkey and Turkish
[14:29] people need you know they need Bitcoin
[14:32] 100% look um between between 2001 in
[14:37] 2023 that's about 21 22 years now the
[14:41] foreign debt went from 130 billion do to
[14:46] $490
[14:48] billion okay petrol was
[14:52] one. 48 Turkish L now it is
[14:56] 35.5 Turkish Lio
[14:59] $1 back in 2001 it was 166 Turkish Euro
[15:04] now it is
[15:05] 29 Turkish Lura and one gram gold one
[15:11] gram of it was 17 Turkish Lura now it is
[15:17] 1,876 Turkish L um and turkey used to be
[15:21] the 17th largest economy in the world
[15:24] now it's
[15:25] 22nd so when I go there I see those
[15:29] people I see those people I mean the
[15:33] inflation is just literally out of this
[15:35] world right now the official figures are
[15:38] if I'm not wrong it is
[15:42] 68% that's the inflation rate but
[15:45] according to Independent bodies last
[15:47] time I checked it was
[15:50] 128% right however the inflation rate
[15:55] people feel outside in the streets when
[15:57] they do their shopping is about
[16:01] 300% it is that bad wow it is yeah it is
[16:05] that bad um
[16:08] why um there are many reasons now just a
[16:12] few uh it's just bad and you know an
[16:15] aggressive political stance um against
[16:18] other countries against like know
[16:20] European countries Western countries and
[16:22] all that uh Central Bank in Turkey isn't
[16:26] independent it's not free you know we
[16:29] have a oneman system and whatever the
[16:31] President says that goes you know if the
[16:34] president of Turkey wants to increase
[16:36] interest rates then the interest rates
[16:38] you know increase if he doesn't want to
[16:40] do that he won't do that uh judicial
[16:44] system is not free again whatever the
[16:47] President says just goes you know he
[16:49] makes the decisions and media is an
[16:53] independent um 93 or 95% of Turkish
[16:57] media is under State control and that
[17:00] means under the president's control so
[17:04] um while a lot of people think you know
[17:07] when they watch TV a lot of people think
[17:09] that turkey is actually a strong and you
[17:12] know in every sense that is you know
[17:15] economically I don't know militarily
[17:17] politically you know Turkey they think
[17:19] turkey is a strong country and it's and
[17:22] yet you know when you look at it from
[17:23] outside you can see it it's
[17:26] not um the fly off money because turkey
[17:30] you know they just keep printing money
[17:32] they just keep printing money
[17:37] look money
[17:39] supply in Turkey year on year Well since
[17:43] last year August to this year August it
[17:47] went up to it went up
[17:49] 65% they just keep they just kept
[17:52] printing money yeah and um and the worst
[17:56] time was back in 1995
[17:59] they kept printing money um how much was
[18:01] it it was 18 sorry
[18:06] 179% right they increased the supply of
[18:08] money by that much
[18:10] 179% now you can't run a country like
[18:12] that you can't run any economy like that
[18:15] now we have good examples again from the
[18:18] other side of the world beginning with
[18:20] El Salvador I'm not too sure about
[18:22] Argentina you know what they're going to
[18:24] do and all that but um on this side of
[18:27] the world turkey definitely needs
[18:30] Bitcoin turkey definitely needs Bitcoin
[18:33] is it going to happen I'm not sure not
[18:36] while we have all while we have these um
[18:40] old minds and old politicians
[18:43] um for me and for you it seems pretty
[18:46] clear that Bitcoin is the best solution
[18:49] for that messed up Financial system and
[18:52] I think a lot of people um agree on the
[18:55] problem like a lot of people agree that
[18:57] feared money and the the financial
[19:01] system right now is kind of broken they
[19:03] disagree on what exactly is broken and
[19:07] they really disagree on the solutions
[19:08] like there are gold bucks there are
[19:11] people that say ETFs there are people
[19:13] saying now Bitcoin and for me and for
[19:16] you I think it's pretty clear that it
[19:18] Bitcoin is the solution and maybe you
[19:20] can sum it up why do you think it's the
[19:24] best solution for that problem um for
[19:28] like someone that is completely outside
[19:30] that has not a lot of knowledge about
[19:32] financial system that has not a lot of
[19:35] knowledge about Bitcoin itself for
[19:37] someone that is new to the space and new
[19:40] to finance and maybe like a young new
[19:43] person to it yeah of course uh I mean
[19:46] look the one thing about Bitcoin is we
[19:48] know exactly how many there are right at
[19:51] the end we know exactly how many there
[19:53] is going to be this thing can't be
[19:55] printed you can't issue an ex you know
[19:58] oh you know what 21 million is not
[20:00] enough you know what we will issue like
[20:02] one one million more you can't do that
[20:05] right and scy
[20:07] is uh one thing that stands out with
[20:10] Bitcoin Fiat money isn't like that even
[20:14] gold isn't like that because um if they
[20:16] need it they can mine more they can get
[20:18] out more Bitcoin is not like that
[20:21] Bitcoin as it stands um it is the best
[20:25] store of value it is the best medum
[20:28] medium of exchange a lot of people argue
[20:30] about it being um being money or medium
[20:33] of exchange you know some people say no
[20:36] it's not some people say yes for me it
[20:38] is and I'll tell you what it has been um
[20:42] I can't remember I can't remember the
[20:43] exact in fact I don't know the exact dat
[20:45] but um the moment that guy paid 10,000
[20:50] um Bitcoins for those two
[20:52] pizzas that's it Bitcoin became money
[20:56] and and and it still is and I'll tell
[20:57] you what what it will get even better so
[21:00] Bitcoin is the only way to go for
[21:03] everyone for everyone and what do you
[21:06] think is the like the main reason that
[21:10] uh that's holding back the mass adoption
[21:13] like or or am I just too impatient for
[21:17] it yes so am I I'll tell you what um I
[21:21] mean Jamie Diamond Elizabeth Warren you
[21:25] know the story of those two and there is
[21:28] loads of them there out there I mean
[21:31] Fiat world look as broken as it is we
[21:34] still have it outside in real world we
[21:37] still have it and I'll tell you um some
[21:40] people are some of my friends are very
[21:43] very enthusiastic about it and I support
[21:45] them all but I know one thing those
[21:48] people the Fiat world are not going to
[21:51] go down without a big fight but you know
[21:56] um it doesn't matter all we have to to
[21:58] do is just you know mine Bitcoin hdle it
[22:00] and that's it in the end I think they
[22:04] will start fighting amongst them
[22:06] themselves not with us because it will
[22:08] happen automatically it has to happen
[22:10] automatically it is
[22:12] inevitable Bitcoin standard is coming
[22:15] not tomorrow not next month not next
[22:17] year maybe not even in the next like you
[22:20] know 10 years but it is coming it is
[22:22] inevitable if not for us for our
[22:25] children it will be here and it will be
[22:28] sa when you say the Bitcoin standard is
[22:30] coming is this also implying that fat
[22:33] will be completely
[22:35] gone I hope so I hope so I mean as I
[22:38] said Fiat World Fiat people companies
[22:41] politicians they're not going to go down
[22:44] uh without a fight of course they will
[22:46] fight you know of course they will fight
[22:48] but there will come a day I believe and
[22:51] this is my personal opinion and you know
[22:53] people will challenge me of course they
[22:55] will but
[22:56] um yes the whole world will be under
[22:59] Bitcoin uh Bitcoin stand because there's
[23:01] absolutely no other way otherwise I'll
[23:03] tell you what
[23:05] um the human race won't survive I don't
[23:09] think
[23:10] so
[23:12] honestly uh we just keep we just keep
[23:14] fighting against each other we just keep
[23:15] killing each other and this Fiat
[23:17] standard as long as it continues we're
[23:20] just going to kill kill each other and
[23:21] probably you know it will be the end of
[23:24] us Bitcoin is going to save us Bitcoin
[23:26] is uh free and Bitcoin is the only way
[23:29] to go that's what I believe yeah I also
[23:32] wonder uh
[23:34] the wars can only be fought if someone
[23:37] finds finances them and most of the wars
[23:40] and uh most of the financial energy that
[23:45] will is put in Wars comes from just
[23:48] printed money borrowed money from the
[23:50] future basically and and if we are on a
[23:55] sound money standard especially on a
[23:57] sound many standard where the sound
[23:59] money can be stored in your head and is
[24:01] not physically there like with gold you
[24:04] can like rob a country and take the gold
[24:08] from the country uh good luck robbing uh
[24:12] Bitcoin from
[24:15] country exactly because people can just
[24:18] store their Bitcoin in the head like no
[24:22] if you if you go in a house and you say
[24:24] give me your gold uh they can say no
[24:28] uh but they can also just shoot you and
[24:30] just take the gold with Bitcoin if they
[24:33] come into your house and say give me
[24:34] your Bitcoin uh they can still shoot you
[24:39] but uh if they shoot you the Bitcoin is
[24:42] also away because maybe you you are the
[24:45] only person knowing where they are or
[24:48] you maybe it's even a brain wallet where
[24:49] it's only like not recommended from my
[24:52] side only having your Bitcoin in your
[24:53] brain but it's it's possible that you
[24:55] only have it in your brain and if the
[24:57] brain is De like you kill the the person
[25:00] the bco is also away like this is kind
[25:03] of it it's just it it it stops the the
[25:08] the physical Wars uh entirely I think
[25:12] maybe I'm naive maybe I'm like a dreamer
[25:15] here but for me physical War so you also
[25:18] think that physical Wars are on a
[25:20] Bitcoin standard not on a global scale
[25:23] not
[25:24] thinkable oh no I mean physical Wars
[25:27] they they can't afford it they can't
[25:29] afford it because each country um yeah
[25:34] let's talk about we're talking about war
[25:36] so each country I don't know they will
[25:38] have a certain amount of um Bitcoin SATs
[25:42] whatever you want to call it right and
[25:44] to support a war say like I don't know
[25:47] country has I don't know 30 30,000 or
[25:50] 40,000
[25:52] Bitcoin but if they realize that that
[25:54] war to support that war they have to
[25:56] spend I don't know at least 50% of that
[26:01] I don't think they will go to war or
[26:03] maybe if you got 40,000 Bitcoin and the
[26:05] war is going to cost you what 52,000
[26:08] Bitcoin they're not going to go to war
[26:11] that's not that's not going to happen
[26:12] but that's not the case right now all
[26:15] they have to do is just turn the
[26:16] printing machine on start printing and
[26:19] that's that's that's that is what's
[26:20] happening
[26:21] today that is the cause of all all um
[26:25] all wars I mean America I think they've
[26:28] just approved if I'm not
[26:31] wrong I can't remember the exact um
[26:34] exact amount now but they have just
[26:35] approved um some more like um financial
[26:38] aid to Ukraine I mean where is this
[26:40] money coming from I mean I speak to my
[26:42] American friends every day you know they
[26:44] don't know where that I mean they know
[26:46] of course they know because America
[26:48] keeps printing money but are they the
[26:51] only ones no everyone does it everyone
[26:55] European Union yeah they do it we do it
[26:58] you know so but Bitcoin you can't print
[27:02] it there's a limited amount we know it's
[27:05] 21 million right everyone will have
[27:07] their share and that's it you can't you
[27:10] can't issue extra ones to support you
[27:12] know Wars so um you know you you're 100%
[27:16] correct correct and and I am with you I
[27:19] think Bitcoin will bring peace in the
[27:21] end as well to us all and if you think
[27:24] that F uh a little further Bitcoin also
[27:28] change the political system
[27:31] right like if you uh if if the
[27:36] government and the centralized
[27:39] organization
[27:41] cannot um just print money they have to
[27:46] uh get the permission from the people to
[27:50] get taxes from them uh basically get
[27:53] fees from them and we know that raising
[27:57] tax access is not something popular but
[28:01] they can print a lot of money that's
[28:04] basically a hidden tax on the people and
[28:07] people are not going on the streets
[28:09] because of that people are going on the
[28:11] streets because of uh I don't know 80%
[28:13] tax something crazy like that so how
[28:16] will the Bitcoin standard change
[28:21] politics I think the politicians um yeah
[28:24] I think I think politicians um in
[28:27] Bitcoin standard will have to be a lot
[28:29] more careful they won't be able to you
[28:32] know um do whatever they like you know
[28:34] like they do right now you know
[28:37] politicians they spend much more than uh
[28:41] they can
[28:43] afford and I'll tell you what it's the
[28:46] same everywhere from America to Turkey
[28:49] from Japan to Spain it's the same
[28:51] everywhere but on the Bitcoin standard
[28:54] they will have to be um more careful
[28:57] because they will be accountable because
[29:00] um as I said you know there's a certain
[29:02] amount of Bitcoin and people will want
[29:04] to know
[29:06] where uh I don't know whatever amount of
[29:09] Bitcoin where it you know where it was
[29:11] spent people will want to know because
[29:14] um they won't be able to like they do
[29:17] right now they won't be able to print um
[29:19] extra Bitcoins to show people oh you
[29:22] know what we've still got it or we'll
[29:24] replace it none of them will happen none
[29:26] of them will happen politicians are
[29:28] going to um proof of work that is what
[29:32] they will have to show in the end proof
[29:34] of work yeah since we're talking about
[29:37] politics and you living since a longer
[29:40] time in the
[29:41] UK um how did you experience the brexit
[29:45] like I'm now in Austria I'm in a country
[29:47] that is still in the European Union
[29:50] maybe I uh getting the wrong information
[29:53] maybe I'm getting a little bit of a bad
[29:56] view about the brexit and the the thing
[29:59] like how would you say is the brexit now
[30:03] in hindsight a good thing or a bad thing
[30:05] how did like I'm a bit I'm bit confused
[30:09] besides
[30:10] fromin yeah right okay um now we are
[30:13] talking about brexit I'm a bit confused
[30:15] about that I must
[30:17] admit um I actually voted to leave
[30:20] European Union but the next day I
[30:23] regretted it I really did because
[30:28] um I don't know why but I am surrounded
[30:32] by uh older people people you know that
[30:34] are older than me and those like mainly
[30:37] English people they've been living here
[30:39] for like other know Generations they
[30:41] they're English born and bred so um they
[30:44] actually told me um
[30:47] how joining European Union you know had
[30:50] changed this country how bad it was you
[30:52] know they immigration I don't know well
[30:56] immigration was the main
[30:58] main thing for for for English or for
[31:00] British people rather so I was kind of
[31:03] convinced I said yeah all right then you
[31:05] know leave work but the next day I
[31:07] regretted it however since
[31:09] 2020
[31:12] covid my mind is changing again because
[31:15] all these things I see you know in
[31:17] European
[31:18] Union are the restrictions they try to
[31:21] put on people as I said you know since
[31:24] the beginning of covid and um you know
[31:26] cbdcs are coming I think to European
[31:28] Union as well as well as here and also
[31:31] wasn't it earlier this year or was it
[31:34] last year I can't remember now but
[31:36] there's a new law in European Union if
[31:39] you want to do a
[31:40] transaction that's more than €11,000 you
[31:45] can't pay in
[31:46] cash there is something like that I
[31:48] don't know if you if you uh know about
[31:50] it so uh they want to know everything
[31:53] about you yeah yeah I heard about it uh
[31:57] um in Austria it was
[32:01] 10,000 I don't know if they also adopted
[32:04] it now to the Thousand down no that
[32:07] €10,000 but I'm I'm not an expert on
[32:10] that yeah but that that 10,000 euro is
[32:12] for say like I don't know you want to
[32:14] come to England for example or you want
[32:16] to go to Turkey wherever you can only
[32:19] take 10,000 in cash without declaring it
[32:24] you can do that but if it is 10,000
[32:28] and I don't know 10,000
[32:30] 10,500 then you have to declare it but
[32:34] this is not that I'm talking about
[32:35] something else say you are selling your
[32:39] car and it
[32:41] is
[32:44] 1,200 right I can't pay you by cash it's
[32:48] against the law now in Europe I have to
[32:51] pay a bank transfer you know or my bank
[32:54] card to pay you so they can see the
[32:56] transaction ction so basically when it
[33:00] comes to European unions yeah as I said
[33:01] you know my mind is changing um all
[33:04] those restrictions I don't really like
[33:06] however there was good things about
[33:09] European Union I must say uh I mean
[33:12] right now in the UK we are struggling
[33:14] for workers I mean we have no nurses I
[33:17] mean we don't have enough nurses we
[33:19] don't have enough doctors we don't have
[33:21] enough people working in the fields um
[33:23] even last year we didn't have any truck
[33:25] drivers we had to um I think the British
[33:28] government uh they had to get Lorry
[33:31] drivers you know truck drivers from the
[33:34] Army to drive all the petrol tankers
[33:37] that deliver you know petrol to petrol
[33:39] stations so yeah I mean this country
[33:42] after after leaving European Union
[33:46] um yeah there are certain
[33:49] things uh that I don't like about
[33:51] European Union but I think after leaving
[33:53] European Union um we are in a worse
[33:55] shape right now finan ually speaking but
[33:58] you know that's that's again that's the
[34:00] up money we're talking about um other
[34:04] than
[34:05] that are we ever going to go back to um
[34:08] go back and join European Union I think
[34:11] in the next 10 years after speaking to
[34:14] quite a few people a lot of people think
[34:16] in the next 10 years there might be
[34:18] another
[34:19] referendum because um a lot of young
[34:21] people they miss European Union that
[34:25] freedom you know going over then you
[34:27] know go to a university and get educated
[34:30] for free you know that freedom people
[34:32] Miss however as far as I can
[34:35] remember European Union actually left
[34:37] the door open for uh Britain they said
[34:40] right okay you can always come back you
[34:42] know the door is open but when you come
[34:45] back UK Britain we're going to have to
[34:48] join Euro we're going to have to use
[34:50] Euro and also we're going to have to
[34:51] join the shenen uh program uh because um
[34:56] I don't think yeah we weren't included
[34:58] in that people people still had to get
[35:00] you know visas you know to come to the
[35:03] UK but we'll see what happens you know I
[35:06] I don't know what the future holds um
[35:08] but yeah we'll see yeah I was just
[35:11] curious It's it was not in my Bitcoin
[35:14] question Playbook but I just thought
[35:16] about it what is your opinion that's
[35:17] what I'd like to know what is your
[35:19] opinion about European Union I'm mixed
[35:22] about it like I was before before I was
[35:25] in Bitcoin I was really into politics
[35:28] also uh and I was also in um small local
[35:34] group uh like not even a small local
[35:36] group it's one small party but that is
[35:40] in the parliament it's a liberal party
[35:42] and they in the like Austria is sub
[35:47] divided into nine sections in yeah
[35:51] so-called bundeslander and in one of
[35:53] those bundeslander I was the head of the
[35:56] yaf organiz ation uh and I was really
[35:59] involved in politics in the Summer where
[36:02] there was an election I spent like 4050
[36:05] hours week uh organizing groups and
[36:09] stuff like that like I was really in
[36:10] involved in that yeah and at that moment
[36:13] I was a big fan of the European
[36:16] Union and this changed a little bit in
[36:19] the in the last years the main reason is
[36:24] um I don't like bureaucracy
[36:27] it can like the European Union
[36:29] definitely as you as you said brings a
[36:32] lot of advantages also like the freedom
[36:34] for young people to just go over the
[36:36] borders do whatever they want like uh o
[36:39] o Open borders is definitely something
[36:42] that can be um an advantage and way more
[36:46] stuff like economically working closer
[36:48] together uh there are a lot of things in
[36:51] there that can be definitely an
[36:53] advantage um but I also see a lot of
[36:57] bureaucracy and uh trying to Monitor and
[37:01] control each individual uh citizen of
[37:05] Austria or the European Union and that
[37:09] can be uh dangerous I think it like
[37:14] having something like a
[37:16] cbdc across the whole European Union
[37:19] where the ECP is in complete control of
[37:22] the money supply and can also program
[37:25] this money and being dependent on that
[37:28] system alone can be a dangerous thing
[37:31] and I'm not saying that there are Elites
[37:34] that have a an game plan and they want
[37:37] to control the the world maybe they are
[37:40] maybe maybe they're not um I just don't
[37:42] want to speculate on that but even if we
[37:45] assume everybody that H is in the cbdc
[37:49] and wants those uh money uh uh Financial
[37:54] systems even if they are complet
[37:56] completely acting in positivity and want
[38:00] just the best for everybody even if this
[38:02] is the case they they implementing A
[38:05] system that can be corrupted and abused
[38:08] by someone that is willing to do it and
[38:11] if yeah history teaches are something
[38:13] it's just a matter of time till someone
[38:16] comes and abuses the system and that's
[38:19] why I really don't like cbdcs and uh too
[38:23] much Central bureaucracy it also kills
[38:26] innovation in a in a in a big way I
[38:30] heard about some medical companies in
[38:33] Germany that moved actually to uh the UK
[38:37] because they had uh less bureaucracy
[38:40] there to do but maybe it was an asch
[38:44] case and um so I'm also kind of confused
[38:50] like if now there was there were an
[38:54] election in Austria should Austria leave
[38:56] or stay I would have to do really proper
[39:01] research about it I would have no
[39:03] opinion right now on that topic yeah
[39:05] yeah yeah you have to weigh it 100% you
[39:07] know pros and cons yeah you have to
[39:09] weigh it big time um but U yeah I yeah
[39:14] cbdcs they are definitely coming you
[39:16] know it's it's it's inevitable that's
[39:19] that's that you know that's on the wall
[39:21] now but um before going into cbdcs I'd
[39:24] like to say something about um Austria I
[39:26] was um I was in turkey last year I drove
[39:30] there so on the way back and and it
[39:33] wasn't in my plans but I ended up in
[39:35] Austria however I actually entered the
[39:38] country like in the afternoon late
[39:41] afternoon so me and my daughter I was
[39:44] driving I was traveling with my daughter
[39:46] and um I don't know I stopped somewhere
[39:49] I stopped somewhere and found a hotel at
[39:52] booking.com right and I got to the hotel
[39:55] it's really dark I can't see anything
[39:58] but I got to the hotel get in the room
[40:00] that's it go to bed and sleep right the
[40:03] next day I wake up I opened the curtain
[40:07] oh my God I was in a little village
[40:11] surrounded by mountains I I really can't
[40:14] remember where I was but I kept that I
[40:16] kept that hotel you know um on
[40:18] booking.com as my favorite beautiful
[40:22] place okay fine but up to this point
[40:24] it's fine yeah now this is what I'm
[40:26] going to say about Austria that country
[40:29] is a proof of work country how let me
[40:35] explain we had our breakfast got in the
[40:37] car and I started
[40:40] driving Robin I just tell me if it's the
[40:43] same everywhere in
[40:44] Austria but I swear to my God and I'm
[40:48] and I'm not saying this just for the
[40:50] sake of saying it I didn't
[40:53] see one single piece of rubbish in any
[40:57] of the streets it was so clean I
[41:01] couldn't believe it right and you know
[41:04] on either side of the road you know you
[41:06] have grass you know we have it here as
[41:08] well but your grass is just so different
[41:12] even the green that it's a different
[41:14] green it's nicely cut I couldn't believe
[41:18] it you know yeah man that country's
[41:22] proof of work they do the work they keep
[41:24] it clean I love it and uh when I get the
[41:27] first opportunity I'm coming back there
[41:29] and I'll go and stay that you know at
[41:30] that hotel once again right going to
[41:34] cbdc there actually a nice
[41:37] yeah go I I want to throw in one nice
[41:40] story I'm not 100% perfectly educated on
[41:44] that but I want to do it like there is
[41:48] when you're driving from Jack to Austria
[41:50] you will notice something like Jack is
[41:52] beautiful uh uh but you notice something
[41:56] even if you drive over the Border um the
[42:00] grass in Austria is just Greener like
[42:02] it's just a little bit more nicer it's
[42:05] just a little bit that more perfect and
[42:09] and I actually was questioning myself
[42:12] that and I was Googling a little bit and
[42:13] I have to look a little bit deeper into
[42:16] that and that has something to do with
[42:19] an earlier stage like a history there
[42:22] were in Austria on that side the people
[42:25] were allowed to keep their own farm and
[42:27] they looked out for the farm and the
[42:29] grass and on the other side uh there
[42:33] were uh this was not the case I have to
[42:36] look into deep like I really want to
[42:38] nail this story and because when you
[42:40] drive from Jack to Austria you can see
[42:42] it so clearly you drive over the border
[42:44] and the grass gets better and of Austria
[42:49] is a really beautiful country it has
[42:50] also a lot of flaws like a lot of taxes
[42:53] a lot offf oh yeah but but that's
[42:56] country but that's yeah that's not the
[42:59] country that's that's the politics
[43:00] that's people whatever but as a country
[43:03] yeah I was so impressed you know I don't
[43:06] care what people say no as a country
[43:09] that is beautiful and as soon as I get
[43:10] the first opportunity I'm coming back
[43:13] there I'm not really a big fan of cities
[43:15] everybody wants to go and see I don't
[43:17] know Vienna and and and and all the
[43:19] other big
[43:20] cities me I I prefer Countryside you
[43:22] know seeing mountains and seeing I don't
[43:25] know Forest and all that Rivers yeah I
[43:27] love that and yeah I'll do that I I'll
[43:30] I'll come back there
[43:31] definitely um um let me know when you're
[43:35] coming yeah I mean hopefully um I mean
[43:38] if you are coming to Prague I'll see you
[43:40] I'll see you in Prague
[43:42] yeah uh yeah but but yeah Austria is Def
[43:46] yeah Austria is definitely a proof of
[43:48] work country they do the work they keep
[43:50] it clean I love it um
[43:54] cbdcs man
[43:57] that is dangerous that is really
[43:59] dangerous I mean cbdcs I remember
[44:01] listening to this lady I can't this was
[44:04] like a while ago uh on Twitter in his
[44:07] face and she said directly she I think
[44:10] she was in finance some some I don't
[44:12] know high rank whatever she was she said
[44:15] that cbdcs were actually created as a
[44:19] direct response to bitcoin right because
[44:22] they can't control Bitcoin they can't
[44:26] confiscate Bitcoin so what did I say
[44:28] earlier these people are not going to go
[44:30] down without a big
[44:32] fight okay uh so CBDs are
[44:36] coming they'll be able to you know uh
[44:39] control your spending as a result you
[44:41] know control people because they want to
[44:43] keep people under
[44:44] control um it is a dangerous thing and
[44:48] and and once again Bitcoin is the only
[44:51] way to go for us you know for everyone
[44:54] Bitcoin is freedom bit Bitcoin Will Keep
[44:57] Us free the cbdcs Ubi Universal basic
[45:01] income is another thing um and I think
[45:05] they tried it a few years back um and it
[45:07] was a trial in Norway for about two
[45:10] years they tried it and I think it
[45:12] worked the result they got um was like
[45:15] 5050 I think so but I think Universal
[45:18] basic income um is coming they're going
[45:22] to they're going to keep people at home
[45:25] a is another thing AI again is is
[45:28] inevitable AI will um cost a lot of
[45:31] people a lot of jobs a lot of people
[45:33] will lose their jobs right all those
[45:35] people sitting at home how are they
[45:37] going to um earn money no they're not
[45:40] going to earn money UB Universal basic
[45:43] income they'll be giving some
[45:45] money in like cbdcs and I think cbdcs if
[45:50] I'm not wrong in the UK because I looked
[45:52] into it say you get paid I don't know if
[45:56] ,000 in cbdcs that money will have like
[46:00] an expiry date I don't know you'll have
[46:03] I don't know six weeks maybe eight weeks
[46:05] to spend it and for whatever reason you
[46:09] can't spend that money it will expire
[46:11] that money will go that's it then you'll
[46:13] get your next £1,000 do you know what
[46:17] this means this means that you will have
[46:19] no chance to save any money you won't
[46:23] have any chance to own it anything you
[46:27] know um no dangerous times are ahead in
[46:32] fact I'll tell you what started in
[46:35] turkey and they passed the law about six
[46:37] weeks ago now in Turkey what they can do
[46:39] now say I don't know you live in a
[46:41] property all of a sudden if the Turkish
[46:44] government declares that area as a
[46:46] reserve area a reserve area means uh
[46:49] basically that that area that that piece
[46:51] of land now belongs to the state they
[46:55] give you 9 20 days to leave the property
[46:58] to leave your land and they show you
[47:01] right this is where you will go and you
[47:03] go there and that's it you can't appeal
[47:06] against it because it's the state right
[47:09] so they uh in Turkey they started taking
[47:11] people's um property away and and the
[47:14] process started people already started
[47:17] receiving letters messages emails
[47:19] whatever and I've seen a few examples it
[47:22] is scary it is scary I know this is
[47:24] happening in Turkey but this turkey
[47:28] isn't really that
[47:29] far you know this will come to us as
[47:32] well very soon I mean you are aware of
[47:35] uh you know what's going on in European
[47:37] Union as you say you know bureaucracy
[47:38] you know cbdcs vaccines and all that um
[47:42] yeah interesting and maybe even
[47:45] dangerous times are ahead but again
[47:47] Bitcoin uh Will Keep Us Safe Bitcoin
[47:50] will give us that freedom I think it's
[47:52] crazy like uh it those examples in
[47:56] Turkey show that Bitcoin is the only
[47:58] thing you truly own property stocks
[48:01] everything else they can take from you
[48:03] with a simple letter it's just so simple
[48:07] it C cannot take from you yeah 100% I
[48:10] mean uh for a while now for the last um
[48:13] how don't I say four or five years I've
[48:15] been thinking you know what maybe I'm
[48:17] just going to get um a small property in
[48:19] Turkey because at the end of the day you
[48:21] know that's where I was born you know I
[48:22] never denied the fact that I am Turkish
[48:24] so I go back there you know as you know
[48:26] I've got strong connections there but
[48:28] maybe I'll get a small you know small
[48:30] property and maybe in my like you know
[48:32] later years you know in my old age I'll
[48:34] live there in Turkey but now no way no
[48:39] way there's no way I'm going to do that
[48:41] same thing don't know is it going to
[48:43] come to Europe EUR European countries I
[48:45] mean so we are supposed to have um you
[48:50] know human rights here you know freedom
[48:52] and all that but even that is limited
[48:56] we'll see how it goes we'll see how it
[48:57] goes but you know uh I won't be
[49:00] surprised honestly nothing can surprise
[49:02] me
[49:03] now there is literally I've never heard
[49:08] um
[49:11] any good example against Bitcoin from no
[49:15] one
[49:17] honestly a lot of people that discount
[49:19] Bitcoin um I don't know they've got
[49:22] their own agenda and anything and
[49:23] they're not even um you know genuine
[49:26] they're not even um real about it they
[49:28] just they just want to disc discount
[49:30] Bitcoin for their own sake you know they
[49:33] they they they mostly um they probably
[49:35] want to gain other don't know something
[49:37] some credit some some some money
[49:39] whatever you know but you can't deny
[49:42] Bitcoin you definitely can't deny no one
[49:45] can if you discount Bitcoin either you
[49:47] are uneducated or you have an own
[49:50] agenda definitely never seen something
[49:52] else definitely definitely and these
[49:55] people
[49:56] yeah I just uh uh wanted to introduce
[50:00] the the last Bitcoin question for you
[50:02] but uh keep
[50:04] going um no I was going to say you know
[50:06] these people with agendas they're
[50:08] actually on TV every day I mean you can
[50:11] see them I mean over here we have our
[50:13] prime minister Rishi sunak right he is
[50:16] the man um
[50:19] who is going to introduce uh in fact he
[50:22] was a Chancellor like a couple of years
[50:24] ago it was him who planned all this out
[50:27] he's you know he started this um cbdc
[50:30] process right and over there in America
[50:33] you know there's Janet Yellen and then
[50:36] um who was that Elizabeth Warren and
[50:38] then Jamie Diamond you know these people
[50:40] are on TV they've got their own agenda
[50:42] why because they don't want to lose
[50:44] control because they can see it Bitcoin
[50:46] will take that control away from
[50:50] them and give it give it back to the
[50:52] people give it back to us that's what it
[50:54] is and for you personally uh what has
[50:57] changed since you adopted Bitcoin like
[50:59] did you notice anything oh yes yes I
[51:03] mean as a person I have changed I can
[51:07] say as a person I have changed um I have
[51:09] made um loads of good friends you know
[51:12] like-minded friends um and I'm in I'm in
[51:14] touch uh with them like every day that's
[51:17] one thing the way I view the world has
[51:21] changed definitely now I won't be um I
[51:25] mean I'm not going to I'm not
[51:27] embarrassed to admit that even though I
[51:30] knew something was wrong in the past
[51:33] maybe I was one of the
[51:35] sheep not maybe definitely I was one of
[51:37] the sheep but once you discover Bitcoin
[51:40] you wake up honestly you do I did and
[51:44] then the way uh you look at everything
[51:47] the the way you view the world you know
[51:49] just just changes and you can't help it
[51:51] you just can't help it so what you want
[51:53] to do and it's like an addiction and it
[51:56] is a good addiction you want to Stack
[51:58] SATs constantly every week DCA if you
[52:02] get the opportunity smash by whatever
[52:05] that's what I do that's what I do so
[52:07] yeah it it has changed me as a
[52:10] person in a good way yeah Bitcoin is
[52:13] definitely H Awakening the line in your
[52:17] especially for me um we have an end
[52:20] routine because we are approaching the
[52:22] the one hour mark already it it goes by
[52:24] so fast we're having an andrine on the
[52:26] podcast where the previous guest ask uh
[52:30] gu asked a question for the next guest
[52:33] okay and you can interpret the the
[52:36] question however you want the the
[52:39] previous uh guest asked you what's the
[52:42] most important life lesson you can think
[52:45] of very good question um although I
[52:49] stopped there for a few
[52:51] seconds um it's not hesitation I I I
[52:55] already know the answer you really need
[52:58] to choose your friends extremely
[53:01] carefully not just carefully extremely
[53:04] carefully you have to assess people you
[53:07] really do need to assess people over and
[53:10] over again you know
[53:13] um it is so difficult
[53:16] to trust people that's what I do
[53:19] automatically I don't have many many
[53:22] many many friends but a few friends I
[53:26] know I know I can trust them so um yeah
[53:30] I think I think
[53:32] um I would say it's that you know choose
[53:35] people very carefully I love it a great
[53:38] ending point uh for the podcast uh man
