[00:00] although Bitcoin didn't reach a new
[00:02] alltime high in the strongest fiat
[00:05] currency the US dollar by now we are
[00:08] still 53% away from that Bitcoin did
[00:11] reach a new alltime high in Argentina as
[00:15] well as in Turkey right now in Argentina
[00:18] we are already
[00:20] 61% over the old oldtime high back in
[00:24] 2021 in Turkey it's only 8% over the
[00:27] alltime high but it's a quite new
[00:29] alltime High since 2021 Bitcoin is up in
[00:33] the strongest field currency 82% year to
[00:36] date this is way stronger than any other
[00:39] asset class we have gold at around 12%
[00:42] we have stocks at around 8% and we all
[00:45] know that cash is definitely trash and
[00:49] never forget there is a Bitcoin Haring
[00:52] coming up let's compare all the Bitcoin
[00:54] price happenings the first one was back
[00:56] in 2012 the Bitcoin price then only 11
[01:01] years ago was
[01:02] $12 so crazy to think about that at the
[01:05] second happening in 2016 just 7 years
[01:09] ago
[01:11] $648 this is over a 50x in the havening
[01:15] period then we went from
[01:18] $648 in 2016 to
[01:22] 8,572 in 20120 this is a 13x performance
[01:26] over the period of one happening right
[01:29] right now we are around 30,000 but with
[01:32] all the positive things going on in the
[01:35] Bitcoin world all the momentum that's
[01:37] beginning to build I think we can hit a
[01:40] quite high price point in the April or
[01:43] March around that time when we have the
[01:46] next Bitcoin happening although the
[01:48] Bitcoin price in fear terms doesn't
[01:51] really matter long term because we know
[01:53] Fiat is going to zero anyways so why do
[01:56] we measure now Bitcoin in Fiat why do we
[01:59] measured it in the Argentine peso in the
[02:02] US dollar in any other currency there's
[02:05] one really good reason for that right
[02:07] now everybody thinks in the US dollar
[02:10] everybody thinks in the euro in the
[02:12] Swiss frank in every local currency they
[02:14] are living in when you go out of the
[02:16] street and you ask someone oh how much
[02:19] money did you spend on that bag they
[02:21] will not answer with Bitcoin they will
[02:23] not answer with anything else than the
[02:25] local currency that they are thinking in
[02:28] and in order to change that over a long
[02:30] period of time we need to establish
[02:32] Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value
[02:35] start using it as a medium of exchange
[02:38] and then only we're getting slowly to
[02:40] the unit of account in the mainstream
[02:43] this is a long long development we are
[02:46] not there right now so in order to
[02:48] onboard all those normies all those new
[02:51] people that never heard of Bitcoin and
[02:54] what it actually is we need the price
[02:57] action in fear terms to get them in it's
[03:00] number go up technology that's the best
[03:02] marketing Bitcoin ever can have it's the
[03:05] one language everybody understands oh
[03:07] Bitcoin was at €600 now it's it's €1,000
[03:10] €2,000 €10,000 € 30,000 so the field
[03:14] price we all know it doesn't matter but
[03:17] it brings in newcomers to bitcoin it's
[03:20] still the best marketing tool ever but
[03:23] it's really important to don't be
[03:24] emotional about the Bitcoin price if it
[03:26] goes down 80% don't be sad if it goes up
[03:30] 50x don't be too happy about it don't be
[03:33] emotional about the Bitcoin price one
[03:35] Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin no matter
[03:37] if it's at € 10 or at 10 million EUR it
[03:40] just doesn't matter Bitcoin is freedom
[03:43] so keep that in mind and always stack
[03:45] enough sets bye-bye
