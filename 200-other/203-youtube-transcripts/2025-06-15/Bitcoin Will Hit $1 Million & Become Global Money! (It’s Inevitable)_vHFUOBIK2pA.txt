[00:00] If we imagine a world where Bitcoin is
[00:02] the global money, it could be that you
[00:05] have currencies that governments issue.
[00:09] But we know currency is not the same
[00:11] thing as money. So the US dollar is a
[00:13] currency, but that doesn't mean it's
[00:14] money. Eric Trump especially is
[00:16] interested in Bitcoin mining and he
[00:18] thinks Bitcoin is inevitably going to go
[00:20] to a million dollars. And so he's very
[00:23] much pro Bitcoin especially due to the
[00:25] fact that his family has been debanked
[00:27] and you know essentially financially
[00:29] persecuted. So now gold looks like a
[00:32] more volatile asset than it was let's
[00:35] say 1970 or 1914. And the same thing
[00:39] applies to Bitcoin. Now there is
[00:41] volatility because it's going through a
[00:43] process of monetization. It's becoming
[00:46] this global money. There are nation
[00:49] states which could potentially acquire
[00:51] more Bitcoin than strategy. It would
[00:54] nominally become $100
[00:57] [Music]
[01:01] million. I think the best place to start
[01:03] with is uh and and and you wrote an
[01:06] amazing article and we can show them
[01:07] also later uh where and how we get to
[01:11] this Bitcoin standard. Maybe as a
[01:13] starting point, how do you define a
[01:17] Bitcoin standard? H what what is this
[01:21] thing that we all call Bitcoin standard?
[01:23] Because I think a lot of people talk
[01:25] about it and I don't know pe different
[01:27] people probably have different
[01:28] definitions of it.
[01:30] Yeah. Um obviously it comes from the
[01:33] whole idea of a monetary standard. So uh
[01:36] obviously from uh at least the late 19th
[01:39] century uh up until let's say 1971 we
[01:43] had the gold standard. So basically uh
[01:46] the currencies that were used around the
[01:49] world although we had the US dollar the
[01:51] great British pound all these others uh
[01:54] most of them were convertible to gold.
[01:57] So it was like a gold certificate
[01:59] essentially. Uh so we could say we're on
[02:01] a gold standard rather than a dollar
[02:04] standard.
[02:05] Um and the same thing applies to
[02:07] Bitcoin. So um you know if we imagine a
[02:12] world where Bitcoin is the global money
[02:17] essentially um it could be that you have
[02:20] currencies that governments issue but we
[02:24] know currencies are not the same thing
[02:25] as money. So the US dollar is a currency
[02:28] but that doesn't mean it's money. So if
[02:31] the the dollar could be convertible to
[02:34] gold or at one stage it was convertible
[02:36] to gold and silver um and now it's a
[02:40] purely fiat currency but it's it's still
[02:43] existed as a currency regardless of what
[02:45] it's backed by. Um whereas Bitcoin is
[02:49] pure sound money, hard money. Um so
[02:53] under a Bitcoin standard, you could
[02:55] still have uh a US dollar. That's
[02:58] actually something I mentioned in my
[03:00] article. Um, but in in that case, uh,
[03:06] the dollar would essentially be almost a
[03:09] denomination of bitcoin. Um,
[03:13] so whatever you value the dollar at or
[03:17] bitcoin at, you can set an exchange rate
[03:21] between u the dollar and bitcoin. So if
[03:24] we say that Bitcoin is $1 million, then
[03:28] that's the exchange rate. Uh we could
[03:31] even say Bitcoin is $10 million or
[03:34] Bitcoin is $und00 million. At the
[03:36] moment, um the price of Bitcoin uh
[03:41] floats uh compared to other currencies
[03:45] uh because they're not pegged, that
[03:46] there's no Bitcoin standard um in
[03:50] existence. So it's it's just like gold
[03:52] or any other asset. You know, the value
[03:55] of any asset floats against the dollar.
[03:58] Uh but that wasn't always the case. At
[04:01] one stage, there was a fixed rate of
[04:04] conversion between gold and the dollar.
[04:07] So, you know, we could say, oh, well,
[04:09] you know, the price of gold is uh it
[04:13] doesn't move. It stays the same. uh and
[04:16] how come now the price of gold shoots up
[04:18] and down and changes depending on the
[04:20] situation of the economy. So now gold
[04:22] looks like a more volatile asset uh than
[04:26] it was let's say 1970 or
[04:30] 1914. Um and the same thing applies to
[04:32] Bitcoin. Now there is volatility because
[04:36] it's going through a process of
[04:38] monetization. It's becoming um this
[04:42] global money uh and it's absorbing a lot
[04:45] of capital and wealth along the way as a
[04:48] sort of financial uh singularity. Uh but
[04:52] a a stage will come when the price of
[04:56] Bitcoin
[04:57] um is either stable relatively speaking
[05:02] due to the size of its market cap or it
[05:05] is stable in a in a perceived way
[05:09] because it is fixed to those uh supposed
[05:13] government currencies like the US
[05:15] dollar. So the US dollar is X amount of
[05:17] Bitcoin. it won't appear to be a
[05:20] volatile asset anymore. Even though as
[05:23] the economy grows, the value of Bitcoin
[05:26] will probably still grow uh into
[05:29] infinity. Uh because the economy will
[05:32] continually grow, the population will
[05:34] increase. Uh but in in terms of you
[05:38] know, how much how many um dollars does
[05:41] it cost to buy one Bitcoin? That will
[05:43] appear to be completely stable if the
[05:46] government pegs it. So um a Bitcoin
[05:49] standard um could exist with that kind
[05:54] of uh conversion but it can also exist
[05:57] independ independently of that. Let's
[05:59] say if um uh all currencies simply
[06:02] collapse and and disappear that's that's
[06:04] more the um uh hyper
[06:07] bitcoinization scenario where everything
[06:10] just goes to pot and perhaps even
[06:12] governments collapse or systems
[06:14] collapse. Uh obviously a lot of um
[06:17] Bitcoin anarchists are sort of in favor
[06:19] of that that kind of scenario. But it
[06:21] doesn't mean necessarily
[06:23] uh if we have a Bitcoin standard that
[06:25] governments no longer exist or
[06:27] governments collapse. Governments could
[06:29] actually um shore themselves up and
[06:32] strengthen themselves uh through
[06:34] adopting uh willingly adopting a Bitcoin
[06:37] standard. And that's one thing I
[06:39] mentioned in the article that perhaps
[06:41] the US um may be able to save itself in
[06:44] a way through um adopting a Bitcoin
[06:48] standard. That's super interesting. Also
[06:50] the definition of what the Bitcoin
[06:52] standard actually looks like. Um so the
[06:55] two two situations are one the
[06:58] government is pegging fiat to bitcoin
[07:00] and the second one is the fiat just
[07:02] doesn't exist anymore and we just have
[07:04] bitcoin is financial singularity which I
[07:06] want to get to a little bit later also
[07:08] could you also imagine a point where
[07:11] bitcoin is extremely dominant and almost
[07:15] like the default currency but there are
[07:18] separate let's say government tokens
[07:21] like fiat currencies where uh or you
[07:23] need to have some of them to pay taxes
[07:26] or like this is doing that act with I
[07:28] don't know if a social security system
[07:31] in the government and uh if if if you
[07:34] cannot pay for yourself you you get this
[07:37] social security tokens from a government
[07:39] whereas like there's like a very niche
[07:41] and small government tokens that are not
[07:43] packed to Bitcoin but they're still
[07:46] there uh because the government wants to
[07:49] uh have some sort of of control or does
[07:52] this not make sense?
[07:54] at all when Bitcoin is already dominant
[07:56] and and everyone can have Bitcoin, why
[07:58] should they adopt a government token?
[08:00] Well, I think um I mean to to do with
[08:03] the first point in terms of taxes and
[08:06] all of that, obviously, you know, it's
[08:08] an inevitability. I think it was
[08:11] probably Benjamin Franklin who said, you
[08:12] know, two of the inevitable things that
[08:15] exist are death and taxes. So as long as
[08:18] there are governments uh there will be
[08:20] taxes because governments want to fund
[08:23] themselves in some way. It doesn't mean
[08:25] there has to be an income tax
[08:27] necessarily. The US survived for most of
[08:29] its history without any income tax. Uh
[08:32] but there will be some kind of tax
[08:34] regardless of what kind of tax it is. Uh
[08:37] but I think one of the the main effects
[08:40] of uh Bitcoin becoming adopted by nation
[08:45] states uh is that it would constrain
[08:48] government's actions. It would shrink
[08:51] government uh because governments can no
[08:55] longer rely on infinite money printing.
[08:58] I mean the US at the moment uh you know
[09:01] funds itself mostly through money
[09:04] printing. it can fund itself through
[09:06] taxation. There's a certain amount of
[09:07] taxation that it takes in. Uh but a lot
[09:11] of its um spending relies upon creating
[09:16] money from thin air, creating adding to
[09:19] this massive national debt and the
[09:21] deficits. Um and that also relates to um
[09:26] what you're saying about welfare, you
[09:28] know, social security,
[09:31] um you know, all of that. I mean that
[09:33] that is probably the largest part of the
[09:37] uh US government budget as I understand
[09:39] it is actually these uh various social
[09:42] welfare programs including social
[09:44] security for older people uh Medicare,
[09:48] Medicaid, um you know food stamps, all
[09:52] these other things. Of course, you also
[09:53] have a huge military budget as well. So
[09:56] there's the military and there's the
[09:58] social security side of things. Um but I
[10:01] think under a Bitcoin standard both of
[10:04] those would have to be reduced uh quite
[10:07] significantly. I don't think you could
[10:08] fund those kind of deficits without
[10:11] massive money printing. As to whether
[10:14] you know you could have a fiat
[10:16] currency living you know purely fiat
[10:18] currency
[10:20] alongside Bitcoin. It's possible just
[10:23] depends I suppose how far Bitcoin
[10:25] adoption goes. It is one of the
[10:27] scenarios that um uh safer amuse talks
[10:31] about um in his uh bitcoin standard
[10:35] research bulletin um and also I think
[10:39] probably in the fiat standard itself uh
[10:42] his second book. I haven't actually
[10:43] fully read that book but I've read bits
[10:45] of it. Uh so he talks about various
[10:48] scenarios how bitcoin could be uh how
[10:51] how it could continue to exist even if
[10:54] it doesn't have uh hyper bitcoinization
[10:58] or global uh mass adoption. It could
[11:01] exist as a kind of uh asset that uh
[11:06] governments respond to because they know
[11:09] it's a threat, you know. So they they
[11:11] know that bitcoin is there in the
[11:13] background as an alternative better
[11:16] money and because of that they they
[11:19] constrain themselves in order to you
[11:22] know essentially prevent bitcoin
[11:24] adoption. Um but at the same time I
[11:28] think um we're now seeing with the US
[11:32] adoption of Bitcoin that perhaps even
[11:35] some of those um predictions of safe
[11:38] were not um uh bullish enough
[11:40] essentially because he was saying for
[11:42] example that oh you know um central
[11:44] banks are increasingly unlikely to adopt
[11:48] Bitcoin and uh at least in the case of
[11:51] the US that that is true. the Federal
[11:53] Reserve itself is not adopting Bitcoin.
[11:57] Uh but the US is adopting Bitcoin. Um uh
[12:02] there are also some central banks that
[12:04] are considering it like the the Czech uh
[12:07] national bank. I haven't been following
[12:08] what's happened since their original
[12:10] announcement that they would consider
[12:12] it. But at least even if they're
[12:14] considering it, that's a step in that
[12:16] direction. So even in that sense, there
[12:18] may be central banks which adopt Bitcoin
[12:21] potentially. uh but it doesn't have to
[12:23] be the the central bank. It could be uh
[12:25] the nation state through a sovereign
[12:27] wealth fund as we see in in the Emirates
[12:30] um or in the US through a specific
[12:34] Bitcoin uh strategic reserve. So, and I
[12:37] I think you know uh I you know I I
[12:41] thought that was an an inevitability at
[12:43] some point but I wouldn't have imagined
[12:44] it coming this soon uh even a few years
[12:48] ago and I don't think safe amuse was
[12:50] imagining that when he was writing uh
[12:52] the Bitcoin standard in in 2018
[12:56] um but yeah so I think it is possible
[12:58] that fiat currencies could continue to
[13:01] exist but I do believe um in this
[13:05] concept of the hardest
[13:07] money does eventually win and I do think
[13:09] we're seeing signs of that. We're seeing
[13:11] the beginning of the rise of a Bitcoin
[13:15] standard. So the most likely outcome at
[13:18] this point is basically financial
[13:20] singularity where Bitcoin is the
[13:22] standard for for
[13:24] for the globe. Yeah, I mean I I think
[13:28] that's likely now. Uh I think that the
[13:31] time for uh Bitcoin to fail has
[13:35] basically passed. That that window of
[13:38] opportunity is gone. There was a time
[13:39] when governments for example could crush
[13:42] Bitcoin uh if they wanted to like the
[13:45] United States government or others
[13:46] potentially could have crushed it at at
[13:49] the outset. uh and they they did try to
[13:52] a certain extent uh in terms of crushing
[13:55] for example uh the Silk Road uh you know
[13:59] seizing Bitcoin you know China shutting
[14:02] down Bitcoin mining they they did make
[14:04] some attempts to constrain Bitcoin but I
[14:08] think we've moved past that the Overton
[14:11] window has has moved and I think that uh
[14:14] you know now Bitcoin has reached this
[14:17] point of um it's it's gain this momentum
[14:22] that is irresistible so that even the US
[14:24] government itself cannot resist this
[14:27] kind of onward march of Bitcoin. It's
[14:30] it's that beautiful game theory because
[14:33] the the moment it was small enough to
[14:37] kill it, it was not attractive enough to
[14:42] actually allocate the resources to
[14:44] actually go ahead and kill it. So let's
[14:46] say
[14:47] 2011 if the US actually was like we
[14:51] don't like that let's kill that they
[14:54] could have done it because it was not
[14:55] that uh big at that moment I think so
[14:59] may maybe not it's always hard to say
[15:01] like what happens if and stuff like that
[15:04] but
[15:05] uh but now because it's so attractive
[15:09] they cannot resist it and they have to
[15:12] kind of adopt it because they know If
[15:15] you don't adopt it, someone else will.
[15:18] And this is the whole game theory where
[15:20] either you either you come on board or
[15:24] you just get left behind at that point.
[15:27] Yeah, exactly. And I think even now I I
[15:31] don't think the US has ever the US
[15:33] government anyway has ever fully
[15:34] understood what Bitcoin is and what it
[15:38] represents. And I think even now uh they
[15:41] don't fully understand it. Um certainly
[15:45] I don't think President Trump
[15:47] understands it. He is pro Bitcoin which
[15:49] is great. He became pro Bitcoin I think
[15:52] because of uh the fact that he realized
[15:55] that there's there's this group of
[15:57] people who could potentially help him to
[16:00] become president you know so if he u
[16:03] caters to this group of people you know
[16:06] libertarians bitcoiners etc and
[16:10] cryptocurrency enthusiasts as well if he
[16:12] caters to them then they can help him to
[16:15] become president um and he surrounded
[16:18] himself with people who are themselves
[16:22] Bitcoiners. Um, you know, such as the
[16:24] the new uh crypto AIS are you you've got
[16:28] David Saxs. Uh you have Bessent the
[16:32] Treasury Secretary uh you have Howard
[16:35] Lutnik um the commerce secretary. He's
[16:38] actually um uh I believe he's the head
[16:42] of or uh CEO of of uh Caner Fitzgerald
[16:48] uh you know which is that uh company
[16:50] that now is uh working with um was it
[16:54] Soft Bank um and what was the other one?
[16:58] I forgot the other one now. But there's
[16:59] there's three companies that are working
[17:01] together to establish this 21 capital.
[17:04] Oh Ted, right? Oh yeah, Tether. Tether,
[17:06] which is one of the major Bitcoin
[17:08] holders. Actually, Tether holds a huge
[17:10] amount of Bitcoin, but yeah, Tether,
[17:12] Soft Bank, and Caner Fitzgerald. Uh, and
[17:15] you know, the guy behind Caner
[17:17] Fitzgerald is Howard Lutnik, who is the
[17:19] commerce secretary in Trump's cabinet.
[17:22] He's also a billionaire. He personally
[17:24] holds a huge amount of Bitcoin himself.
[17:26] He's constantly acquiring it. Um and
[17:29] he's also uh I believe I think it's with
[17:32] Bessent he's also the the the person
[17:35] who's responsible for what goes into the
[17:38] um the US sovereign wealth fund which
[17:41] they've just created. So that US
[17:43] sovereign wealth fund itself could
[17:45] potentially acquire Bitcoin or it could
[17:48] acquire even you know shares in in
[17:51] strategy you know MSTR it could acquire
[17:54] shares in the 20 21 capital you know
[17:57] which which is going to be indirectly
[18:00] uh uh Bitcoin essentially well it's it's
[18:02] it's going to be acquiring Bitcoin um in
[18:06] competition with uh Michael Sailor's
[18:09] company so uh it's it's Just interesting
[18:12] that Trump has surrounded himself with
[18:15] these Bitcoiners. Um, and even members
[18:19] of his family now like Eric Trump, uh,
[18:23] probably Donald Trump Jr. as well, I
[18:25] imagine, but Eric Trump especially, is
[18:26] is interested in Bitcoin mining and he
[18:29] thinks Bitcoin is inevitably going to go
[18:31] to, uh, a million dollars. And so he's
[18:34] very much pro Bitcoin uh especially due
[18:37] to the fact that his family has been
[18:39] debanked and you know essentially
[18:42] financially persecuted um at the same
[18:44] time as well. So but uh even them uh I
[18:49] think you know they understand Bitcoin
[18:52] to a certain degree. Do they know that
[18:55] uh a Bitcoin standard would eventually
[18:59] replace the dollar as we know it? I'm
[19:02] not sure. I think they they they see it
[19:04] as this um apex store of value. Um and
[19:09] they realize why the US should acquire
[19:11] it because the US wants to increase its
[19:14] wealth. It wants to pay off the national
[19:16] debt. Um it wants to monetize its assets
[19:19] and why should the US be selling and
[19:22] getting rid of the Bitcoin that it
[19:23] already holds. Uh but but yeah, I mean
[19:25] Bessent and and Sachs also want to
[19:28] acquire more Bitcoin for the uh Bitcoin
[19:31] strategic reserve as well in a tax
[19:34] neutral way, which could be anything
[19:35] from like uh you know selling gold or
[19:38] selling other assets to uh uh issuing
[19:42] special bit bonds or bitcoin bonds of
[19:46] some kind uh or another. Uh but yeah, I
[19:49] think they don't quite see necessarily
[19:52] the end. I could be wrong. Maybe Howard
[19:54] Lutnik and these others actually do see
[19:57] the the final vision of of Bitcoin, but
[20:00] I I'm not 100% certain that they they do
[20:03] realize that the US dollar as we know it
[20:06] could cease to exist because on a
[20:09] Bitcoin standard uh you could still have
[20:12] something called the US dollar, but it
[20:14] wouldn't be what it is now. It wouldn't
[20:17] be the US dollar that we know, which is
[20:19] the purely fiat currency. If it becomes
[20:23] backed by Bitcoin
[20:25] 100% then it's essentially uh you're
[20:28] spending bitcoin. You're just spending
[20:29] bitcoin that you don't hold yourself. So
[20:32] if I if if bitcoin is uh denominated as
[20:37] $100 million per bitcoin then one
[20:42] bitcoin is one satoshi. So, uh, you
[20:45] know, if you spend $1 on something, you
[20:48] are by default spending one Satoshi
[20:51] because they're backed one to one. Uh,
[20:54] you're just not spending it on the
[20:55] lightning network or on the base chain.
[20:58] Uh, so it's it's kind of a a way of
[21:01] scaling Bitcoin essentially. But in that
[21:04] sense, uh, the US loses its power to
[21:08] print money because you can't print more
[21:10] than it holds in Bitcoin. So, it needs
[21:13] to hold as much Bitcoin as it can in
[21:15] order to, you know, issue dollars that
[21:18] are backed by that that uh that Bitcoin.
[21:23] That's super interesting. Just a quick
[21:25] question on on the 21 Capital will which
[21:28] will be I think led by Czech Mullers
[21:31] with the the three companies together
[21:33] that you mentioned. Is that the first
[21:36] real competition to to strate? I think
[21:38] it is. And I think it's uh the thing
[21:41] that's interesting about it is is it's
[21:43] not a company that was doing something
[21:46] else that is now adopting a Bitcoin
[21:49] standard. That's that's been the example
[21:51] up to this point. Any company like Micro
[21:53] Strategy or Strategy as it's now called
[21:55] is a software company. You know, it it
[21:58] relies on business intelligence. It it
[22:00] it produces software. Now it's become a
[22:02] Bitcoin treasury company but that was to
[22:05] save the company and because Michael
[22:07] Sailor realized this will save my
[22:09] company and it will also uh allow me to
[22:12] acquire this most valuable asset. Um but
[22:16] this now I think is yeah the first real
[22:19] implementation of you know let's uh
[22:23] create a purpose-built uh Bitcoin
[22:26] treasury company. Uh so it is
[22:29] competition in the sense that it's it's
[22:31] going to try and do uh what strategies
[22:35] already doing and perhaps in some ways
[22:37] improve upon it like for example
[22:39] releasing proof of reserves and uh you
[22:42] know other maybe they'll use different
[22:44] methods of of raising uh money that I'm
[22:48] not aware of. Um but
[22:51] uh in terms of actually are they on the
[22:54] same level as strategy then I don't
[22:59] think necessarily they are because what
[23:02] I mean by that is can they uh
[23:05] significantly acquire Bitcoin to the
[23:08] level of uh strategy? I don't think so
[23:12] because there's a first mover advantage.
[23:15] you know, there's no way really for
[23:17] anyone to catch up because if you do
[23:19] catch up, that means you're acquiring
[23:22] hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and to
[23:26] this the supply is so limited that if
[23:30] you're doing that, you will
[23:31] significantly affect the price. If you
[23:34] significantly affect the price, you
[23:36] basically further push uh strategies
[23:39] lead ahead of you. So I think there is
[23:42] competition in terms of nation states uh
[23:46] because there are nation states which
[23:48] could potentially acquire more bitcoin
[23:52] than strategy uh like the United States
[23:55] like China and a handful of others
[23:59] possibly you know like some of the Gulf
[24:01] states, Arab Gulf states, a few other
[24:04] wealthy uh Asian nations. um in Europe,
[24:10] I mean there's a potential, but I think
[24:13] uh European governments at the moment
[24:16] are so myopic and uh uh so drunk on the
[24:21] fiat standard uh and the idea of
[24:24] centralized control, centralized
[24:26] governance that they are unlikely to
[24:31] ever acquire as much as um uh the United
[24:35] States or as as much as uh strategy.
[24:38] simply because they don't have the will
[24:39] and the vision. Uh but the United States
[24:42] can, China could potentially realize
[24:44] this long before the EU or the UK. The
[24:47] UK as well is is pretty myopic in terms
[24:50] of Bitcoin. Um but luckily they they
[24:53] currently have uh in theory 61,000 I
[24:57] think it is Bitcoin. So they've already
[24:59] got a certain amount by accident
[25:01] essentially or through uh taking it from
[25:04] criminals. So, as long as they don't
[25:05] make the mistake that Germany made of uh
[25:08] selling all their Bitcoin, then they
[25:11] should be okay. The UK should be okay.
[25:13] But still, it's not going to catch up
[25:16] with uh strategy. I I I just think
[25:18] there's not enough Bitcoin in the world,
[25:20] you know, essentially. If the US really
[25:23] got serious about it, they could acquire
[25:26] maybe 5 million Bitcoin if they wanted
[25:28] to if they really get get it. Uh but if
[25:31] they're doing that then China will want
[25:34] to compete you know if and if China's
[25:37] also trying to get five million bitcoin
[25:40] there's only 21 million bitcoin that can
[25:42] exist and there's around you know let's
[25:46] say 195 or maybe up to 200 countries in
[25:51] the world. So if you have roughly uh 200
[25:55] countries, you have 21 million Bitcoin,
[25:59] you know, you have companies that want
[26:00] to acquire Bitcoin. Um so and also high
[26:04] netw worth individuals, hedge funds,
[26:06] banks, uh you name it. How does
[26:10] everybody get enough Bitcoin? How does
[26:13] everyone get as much Bitcoin as they
[26:15] want? There's a limit to what you can
[26:17] acquire in Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin
[26:20] itself can absorb any amount of wealth.
[26:23] So it could absorb all the wealth that's
[26:25] in existence in the world and uh you
[26:29] know you could you could absorb all of
[26:30] that into 21 million bitcoin but not
[26:33] everyone can get uh as much bitcoin as
[26:36] they want. So it's it's in that sense
[26:39] it's a zero sum game. Even though wealth
[26:41] itself is not a zero- sum game. Wealth
[26:43] can infinitely be created. You know
[26:45] there's no fixed pie of wealth in the
[26:47] world. But there is a fixed pie of a uh
[26:52] an absolutely scarce currency. So
[26:55] Bitcoin is a fixed pie. So it is a zero-
[26:58] sum game. If someone gets more Bitcoin,
[27:02] someone else has less Bitcoin that they
[27:04] can get. So uh in that sense, yeah, I I
[27:08] as I said, I don't think that 21 Capital
[27:10] can compete uh to get as much Bitcoin as
[27:14] strategy. Uh but I do think governments
[27:18] can compete with strategy if they're
[27:20] wealthy, powerful governments, not uh
[27:24] maybe the bottom 150 countries in the
[27:26] world, but maybe the top uh 20, 30,
[27:30] maybe up to 50 countries could
[27:32] potentially compete with strategy, but
[27:34] they have to be there first. They have
[27:36] to do it before the other countries or
[27:39] they will lose essentially. Let's take a
[27:41] break for a moment and appreciate the
[27:44] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[27:47] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[27:49] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[27:52] of showing that you are a true
[27:55] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[27:57] dropped a completely new and amazing
[28:00] Genesis edition of their watch
[28:03] collections. You have the date of the
[28:05] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[28:08] and of course also the block height and
[28:11] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[28:14] the level of detail they put in in this
[28:17] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[28:19] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[28:22] down in the descriptions. I love those
[28:25] watches so so much. And now if you have
[28:28] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[28:31] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[28:33] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[28:35] to deal with that. The first way is you
[28:37] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[28:39] entry for you to get into the
[28:42] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[28:45] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[28:48] super simple and secure way. And if you
[28:51] check out the link in the description,
[28:53] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[28:56] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[28:59] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[29:02] partner in terms of how to get the most
[29:05] out of your sovereignty. They will
[29:07] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[29:10] that is perfect for your individual
[29:13] situation. They will show you how you
[29:15] can secure your own devices. Securing
[29:18] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[29:20] have to keep all your devices secure.
[29:23] One topic that is overlooked often is
[29:25] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[29:28] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[29:31] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[29:33] place already? And last but not least,
[29:35] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[29:37] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[29:40] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[29:45] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[29:48] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[29:50] be for the first time ever speaking at
[29:53] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[29:56] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[29:58] really looking forward to seeing all of
[30:00] you there. You can get your ticket in
[30:03] the link down in the description of
[30:05] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[30:07] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[30:11] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[30:13] there. Yeah. And they have to, it's a
[30:15] really tricky game because you have to
[30:17] be
[30:19] quick but
[30:20] also not so aggressive that people
[30:24] notice it too much. So you you're I mean
[30:27] Donald Trump honestly is is in one heck
[30:30] of a position because other world
[30:32] leaders um might like ah he's just
[30:35] crazy. Um and and maybe he's selling all
[30:38] of the Bitcoin like in in one year later
[30:41] and stuff like that. So I if someone is
[30:44] currently in a great position to take
[30:47] the pole position in the in a Bitcoin
[30:50] world, it's the US. It's it's it's they
[30:53] have a really great position. Um the the
[30:57] imagine the the fear of missing out for
[31:01] Bitcoin if Joe Biden did the same
[31:04] thing. It would be a completely
[31:06] different thing. It's it's the same
[31:08] thing for me with let's say Tesla
[31:12] already bought Bitcoin. Like that's a
[31:14] actual thing. We don't have to say that
[31:16] because Tesla actually bought already I
[31:18] think now they have like 10,000 Bitcoin.
[31:20] This is not taken as
[31:22] serious as Apple would buy Bitcoin with
[31:27] the same percentage amount from the
[31:29] balance sheet and stuff like that
[31:31] because Apple is just looking at a is
[31:33] just looking is is taking in a different
[31:36] light and when you look from from
[31:39] European perspective and and other
[31:40] things
[31:42] uh I don't know if
[31:45] if it would be fun to see how people
[31:48] would react if someone where you don't
[31:51] expect something like that like Joe
[31:54] Biden or Camel Harris like the Democrat
[31:56] party uh would do the same thing and say
[31:59] oh we have a strategic Bitcoin reserve
[32:01] and maybe we buy some it is completely
[32:03] outlandish I think it wouldn't have uh
[32:06] been possible uh but that that probably
[32:09] would trigger it
[32:12] faster all with all that I just want to
[32:15] say I think Trump is in a great position
[32:18] buying a lot of Bitcoin
[32:20] and other nation states being confused
[32:23] what he actually wants to do with that
[32:26] uh because he's an uh known as an
[32:29] unpredictable guy. I mean he he wrote
[32:31] the uh art of uh the art of the deal and
[32:34] this is literally a point that he writes
[32:36] like never be predictable for for your
[32:39] opponent.
[32:40] So that that is a unique position to to
[32:43] be in. I don't know if that was clear
[32:45] what I tried to communicate but he's in
[32:47] a really unique position. the US is in a
[32:49] really unique position to get a a huge
[32:52] head start in the next four years for
[32:54] for Bitcoin World. Yeah, exactly. I
[32:57] think um I think it's also the fact that
[33:00] uh you know Trump is willing to try
[33:04] different things that haven't been tried
[33:06] before. Uh I mean an example of that is
[33:09] this um US sovereign wealth fund. Yeah,
[33:12] there are some nations which have
[33:13] sovereign wealth funds like Norway, uh
[33:16] the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of
[33:18] Saudi Arabia, a number of other places,
[33:20] I think a few other probably European
[33:22] countries. Um but the US has never tried
[33:25] that, you know. Uh so up up up till uh
[33:28] his election things were just kind of
[33:30] business as usual. the Federal Reserve
[33:33] does the same things as usual, you know,
[33:35] but now um he's come into office. He's
[33:38] got uh interesting people around him,
[33:40] you know, people with new ideas who want
[33:42] to try different things. And you know,
[33:45] he's putting that into action. And you
[33:47] know, I think he's the kind of person
[33:49] who says, you know, crypto, Bitcoin,
[33:52] yeah, it might help us to pay off the
[33:54] national debt. Okay, let's try it. Let's
[33:56] figure out if that's going to happen.
[33:57] You know, let's buy some Bitcoin. Let's
[33:59] put it in a reserve. it, you know, if it
[34:01] helps us to pay off the debt in 10
[34:03] years, 15 years, great. You know, he was
[34:05] actually saying that in one quote where
[34:07] he was saying, you know, maybe we pay
[34:08] off the debt with uh with some Bitcoin,
[34:11] maybe we pay it off with a crypto check
[34:13] or something like that, he was saying.
[34:14] So, you know, he doesn't fully
[34:16] understand what Bitcoin is, but he he
[34:18] thinks, well, may some people have told
[34:20] me it could pay off the national debt.
[34:22] Let's try it. Let's see if that works.
[34:24] So, because he's that's the thing about
[34:26] I think entrepreneurs and and business
[34:28] people is that they want to try things,
[34:31] see if they work. If it doesn't work, it
[34:33] doesn't work and you just try something
[34:35] else. But you should try it. You know,
[34:37] someone's got a good idea. Okay, let's
[34:39] try your idea, see if it works. It's a
[34:42] very different kind of mentality from a
[34:44] traditional politician. the politician
[34:46] says, "Well, you know, our experts have
[34:48] told us in this report that we need to,
[34:51] you know, keep inflation at 2% and, you
[34:54] know, we need to do this and do that."
[34:56] That's kind of the politician's
[34:57] mentality. What's our political party?
[34:59] What's our uh platform? Okay, we promise
[35:02] to do this. But a businessman comes in
[35:04] and says, "Okay, well, we might need to
[35:06] break some things in order to make other
[35:09] things work. You know, we might need to
[35:11] try some new ideas that haven't been
[35:12] tried before." Uh and and that's seems
[35:15] to be what he what he's doing at the
[35:17] moment. Some of the things he does may
[35:19] not work. Some of the things he does may
[35:21] make things worse, you know, but he's
[35:23] just trying and seeing, you know, what
[35:24] what will work. And that's why it's
[35:27] great that he's he's looking into
[35:29] Bitcoin. And he has people around him
[35:31] who have a higher level of understanding
[35:33] of Bitcoin uh than he has like um you
[35:36] know David Saxs, Bessent and and Lutnik.
[35:39] So at least they are now uh implementing
[35:43] things that he might not have thought of
[35:44] himself like uh as I said new methods of
[35:48] acquiring bitcoin for the um for the
[35:51] fund uh which uh are tax neutral which
[35:55] don't involve you know creating new debt
[35:58] to buy the bitcoin. Uh so I mean maybe
[36:01] at some point in the future we get a a
[36:03] really pro- bitcoin president who
[36:05] actually says you know let's just print
[36:07] the dollar and buy bitcoin uh which is I
[36:11] think something uh sailor talked about.
[36:13] He said you know the first country to to
[36:15] print its currency to buy bitcoin wins.
[36:18] Uh but at the moment that's not the US
[36:20] approach. The US approach is let's find
[36:23] ways that don't hurt the taxpayer uh
[36:26] that will allow us to acquire more
[36:28] bitcoin. So I think yeah America is in
[36:30] this um unique position because they
[36:33] have this entrepreneur president. Um
[36:37] China at the moment and Russia and other
[36:39] countries uh you know they do recognize
[36:42] perhaps to a degree uh that Bitcoin is a
[36:47] unique asset and it's it's doing things.
[36:49] I mean I think certainly Putin has
[36:52] mentioned Bitcoin. He's talked he he
[36:54] understands Bitcoin to a certain extent.
[36:57] Um, I don't really know what uh the
[37:00] president of China's understanding of
[37:02] Bitcoin is, but at the moment they seem
[37:04] to they they seem to recognize that the
[37:07] current US order, the current dollar
[37:11] standard that exists
[37:13] um is coming to an end. um the dominance
[37:16] of the US dollar is coming to an end and
[37:20] um they are now uh hedging themselves by
[37:25] acquiring as much gold as they can.
[37:27] They're massively acquiring gold and uh
[37:32] that's that's probably being good for
[37:33] them financially at the moment because
[37:35] of the price of gold going up. I mean
[37:37] the price of gold going up is a sign of
[37:40] uh the collapse of the dollar
[37:42] essentially. Um but uh it may be a
[37:46] mistake on their part because they're
[37:49] thinking maybe too traditionally. You
[37:51] know, they see you've got dollar or
[37:54] you've got something else. What's what's
[37:55] the something else? Well, traditionally
[37:57] it's been gold. Um and that may mean
[38:01] that they make a mistake. And this is
[38:03] something interesting that you read in
[38:05] uh in the Bitcoin standard about when
[38:08] the gold standard was adopted at the end
[38:10] of the 19th century. There were
[38:12] countries which got on the gold standard
[38:15] uh like Britain, the British Empire got
[38:18] on the gold standard and it did very
[38:20] well as a result of that. Whereas uh
[38:23] China at the time uh didn't get on the
[38:26] gold standard and they were still using
[38:28] I think silver um and other things. And
[38:30] so as a result uh China ended up in a
[38:34] very weak position and you know they got
[38:37] um basically uh pushed around and
[38:41] obviously Britain managed to get Hong
[38:43] Kong and uh they weren't doing so well.
[38:46] So uh you wonder if China and Russia are
[38:50] potentially making the same mistake
[38:52] again by um adopting gold or at least
[38:56] acquiring gold instead of acquiring
[38:59] Bitcoin. And you wonder what at what
[39:01] point will they recognize that they
[39:04] should be acquiring Bitcoin? Is it too
[39:07] late? Is it after the US has already
[39:08] said, "Okay, we're going to get um you
[39:11] know, 10% of the Bitcoin or something."
[39:13] You know, is the US going to start
[39:15] acquiring a million Bitcoin and then uh
[39:19] China and Russia finally realize, oh,
[39:22] actually, we should be acquiring
[39:24] Bitcoin. And then they could potentially
[39:26] sell their gold for that possibly. Uh so
[39:29] it's interesting to see yeah how does
[39:31] game theory play out. At the moment I
[39:33] don't think the race has started. I
[39:35] don't think nation states h are already
[39:37] racing to get bitcoin at the moment.
[39:40] It's still an obscure thing. It's still
[39:42] even though the US has a bitcoin
[39:44] strategic reserve. They themselves have
[39:47] not started acquiring uh more bitcoin in
[39:50] that reserve that that we know about
[39:52] yet.
[39:53] uh they still haven't announced their
[39:55] the result of their audit of how much
[39:57] Bitcoin they do actually hold at the
[39:59] moment. We think it's around 200,000,
[40:02] but nobody's verified that yet. So, I
[40:05] think we're still at a very early stage
[40:07] before the game theory actually kicks in
[40:10] and nation states do start rushing to
[40:13] buy Bitcoin. I think that will happen
[40:15] and then some nation states will get
[40:18] ahead, others will get left behind. I
[40:21] think China will still be in a good
[40:23] position because of its wealth. Uh but
[40:26] any nation state that does get left
[40:28] behind uh will not be doing so well
[40:31] unfortunately and that that that could
[40:33] affect uh you know Europe, it could
[40:36] affect Latin America, could affect many
[40:38] many places if they don't uh actually
[40:42] realize that they're missing out. That's
[40:45] that was a lot in there. Um, we also
[40:48] talked I where where do I begin? Uh, one
[40:52] thing uh I I just want to show I search
[40:54] it up while you were were talking. Um,
[40:58] maybe that for people that haven't seen
[41:00] that because I think it's really
[41:01] interesting that
[41:03] uh Donald Trump actually said that and I
[41:06] hope everyone can can hear that now. I I
[41:09] I saw the the the point and he's he
[41:12] actually said that in two different
[41:14] occasions and this is now one of them
[41:16] where he was on an on an interview but
[41:18] he also said it at an event where
[41:22] Bitcoiner asks him or what do you think
[41:24] about Bitcoin? What can Bitcoin do? Uh
[41:26] basically um but this I I feel like is
[41:29] might be the the better one. So just
[41:32] like see what what he said directly.
[41:35] They think it's good. Who knows? Maybe
[41:37] we'll pay off our $35 trillion, hand him
[41:39] a little crypto check, right? We'll hand
[41:41] him a little Bitcoin and wipe out our
[41:43] $35 trillion. But how do you uh I don't
[41:47] know. Did you hear it? It's exactly what
[41:50] that that he just said like, "Oh, like
[41:52] uh we we might wipe out our 35
[41:55] trillion." I mean, at that point, I
[41:57] think it's now already 36 or 37
[41:59] trillion. Um uh uh with a little crypto
[42:04] or Bitcoin check. Let's give them some
[42:06] Bitcoin for that. Yes, it it might be
[42:10] comical in in the first sense like when
[42:12] you hear that and how he says it. The
[42:14] implications of that is someone actually
[42:18] talked with him about that. He he he
[42:21] would not say that on national TV
[42:24] because he had one idea in in his head
[42:27] or something like somewhere somewhere
[42:29] this idea in his head came to be and
[42:32] there was some Bitcoiner that talked
[42:34] with him or some people some group that
[42:37] talked about that like oh we we could uh
[42:40] have a Bitcoin strategic reserve and pay
[42:43] down our depth. And also Cind Lumis I
[42:45] think was this was the uh way she uh
[42:50] reasoned in in the in the bill that this
[42:54] can make uh the US more so and also pay
[42:59] down the depth. So this is something
[43:02] that
[43:04] is could could be bigger than the than
[43:07] than we think. But yeah, maybe it's also
[43:09] just like a comical thing that he he
[43:11] said in that moment. Uh but uh I I do
[43:14] think it's it's
[43:15] something you you kind of have to pay
[43:17] attention to what he says and what that
[43:19] actually means.
[43:21] Yeah, I definitely agree that uh if it's
[43:24] something that he's thinking about um
[43:27] you know, it doesn't mean that that's
[43:28] necessarily going to happen, but also
[43:31] this is something that goes beyond his
[43:33] presidency as well because um if we look
[43:38] at for example the proposals that
[43:40] Senator uh Lumis makes in her Bitcoin
[43:44] bill, I mean the idea um initially I
[43:49] think is that America should acquire uh
[43:53] a million bitcoin over a period of 5
[43:56] years. So that's 200,000 bitcoin perom.
[44:00] In the original version of her bill,
[44:02] that was the absolute limit on what the
[44:05] US could acquire that they could acquire
[44:07] up to 200,000 bitcoin
[44:10] perom. And now I believe uh I think I
[44:14] read it that that it's um it's sort of
[44:17] the base that America acquires 200
[44:20] Bitcoin perom. So it could acquire more
[44:22] than that potentially. Um and then I
[44:27] think she was saying that within I don't
[44:29] know if she said 10 or 20 years it could
[44:32] uh pay off um something like half the
[44:35] debt. I think that was her uh her idea.
[44:38] Now I know that Michael Sailor I don't
[44:40] remember the exact numbers that Sailor
[44:42] used but Sailor himself also had a
[44:45] proposal regarding uh Bitcoin and
[44:48] digital assets and part of that again
[44:51] was uh paying off the national debt
[44:53] whereas he suggested that that the US
[44:56] could pay off the entire uh national
[45:00] debt. Um, I don't know if that's also
[45:02] something that he discussed at the
[45:04] crypto summit in the White House. uh
[45:07] because the part that was actually aired
[45:11] was kind of the initial comments like
[45:13] Trump's initial comments and the other
[45:14] people in the room but I I think the
[45:17] actual crypto summit went on a bit after
[45:19] the cameras switched off and Sailor
[45:22] didn't speak in the part that was um uh
[45:25] on camera but perhaps afterwards Sailor
[45:28] uh spoke and gave some ideas and Trump
[45:31] would have heard those ideas as well. Um
[45:33] although this is after that uh the clip
[45:36] that you just showed that that's before
[45:38] uh I think that might have even been
[45:39] before he was elected um when he did
[45:42] that clip. I don't remember. Yeah, it it
[45:45] was I think before he he was elected
[45:47] actually. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Which is
[45:49] very interesting. Uh so yeah uh so there
[45:52] are different proposals. I mean Cynthia
[45:54] Lumis is is kind of a base case proposal
[45:57] that would talk about eliminating
[45:59] potentially half the debt. uh Sailor's
[46:02] proposal is to eliminate all the debt
[46:04] and of course he wants the US to acquire
[46:07] a lot more than uh 1 million bitcoin I
[46:11] think up to 5 million bitcoin which is
[46:13] similar also to uh Robert Kennedy
[46:17] Junior's proposal you know when he was
[46:19] running for president he proposed also
[46:21] to establish a bitcoin strategic reserve
[46:24] but to acquire I think up to 5 million
[46:27] uh bitcoin and it's interesting that
[46:29] he's also in Trump's cabinet as well. So
[46:32] he he's also another Bitcoiner there in
[46:34] the cabin. In fact, I think he said at
[46:36] one point that uh most of his wealth is
[46:39] in Bitcoin. So Robert Kennedy is is a
[46:42] real uh you know Bitcoin or Bitcoin bull
[46:47] who just mostly holds Bitcoin. Uh so
[46:50] that's very interesting as well. So
[46:52] yeah, I think um that those ideas are
[46:56] out there, but as I was saying in terms
[46:58] of denomination, I think, you know,
[47:00] potentially to wipe out the debt, you
[47:03] can do that uh sort of through a kind of
[47:06] default in a way, but by devaluing the
[47:10] dollar. Now, I know that um at least
[47:13] officially Trump and his uh team want to
[47:17] strengthen the US dollar, but I'm I'm
[47:20] sure many of them are aware that really,
[47:23] you know, at some point you have to
[47:25] devalue the dollar. Um especially in
[47:28] terms of the debt and the deficit
[47:30] spending and all of that. And that's
[47:31] always been the case throughout the fiat
[47:34] standard that you've had to devalue the
[47:36] dollar to kind of devalue the debt. um
[47:40] and also make yourself competitive.
[47:41] There's other economic reasons as well.
[47:43] Uh but in terms of wiping out the debt,
[47:47] if you change the exchange rate, fix the
[47:50] exchange rate um between Bitcoin and the
[47:53] dollar, it doesn't have to be close to
[47:55] the natural exchange rate. So at the
[47:58] moment, for example, Bitcoin is $94,000.
[48:02] But even now if the US government came
[48:04] along and said okay we're establishing a
[48:06] bitcoin standard in the US uh we're
[48:09] denominating um you know one bitcoin as
[48:12] $und00 million then they could do that
[48:15] even even now I mean you could have one
[48:18] bitcoin worth $und00 million tomorrow if
[48:21] the US government said so but that would
[48:23] be a massive devaluation of the US
[48:26] dollar essentially it wouldn't be
[48:27] actually changing the real value of
[48:30] bitcoin
[48:31] not through the denomination. Although
[48:34] actually adopting a bitcoin standard
[48:36] would mean that uh it becomes more
[48:39] desirable and hence the real value of
[48:41] bitcoin would also go up in that that
[48:44] sense but um it would nominally become
[48:48] $100 million. Uh so um that could happen
[48:53] even tomorrow but obviously it probably
[48:55] won't. Um but when it is fi finally uh
[48:59] when the US dollar is finally devalued
[49:01] in that sense Bitcoin will probably be a
[49:04] lot closer to that. You know Bitcoin
[49:07] could already be uh $10 million let's
[49:10] say uh uh on the actual exchange rate.
[49:14] So Bitcoin could be worth $10 million
[49:16] and the US government says okay we want
[49:18] to devalue the debt. So even though
[49:20] Bitcoin is $10 million right now we want
[49:23] to make it a hundred million dollars. So
[49:25] they're essentially, you know, making
[49:27] the dollar a tenth of its uh current
[49:30] value by pegging it uh to Bitcoin. So
[49:33] that that I think that's that's
[49:35] possible. You mentioned now the the $100
[49:38] million uh I think like two or three
[49:41] times. Is is that kind of I know when we
[49:46] come to a Bitcoin standard, it does not
[49:48] make sense to price Bitcoin in US
[49:51] dollars. Bitcoin will price other
[49:53] things.
[49:54] But I think right now in the world the
[49:57] US dollar or euro this is kind of the
[49:59] reference point for unit of account.
[50:01] Even bitcoin businesses liked that are
[50:04] bitcoin only they denominate uh their
[50:07] prices on the back end in US dollars or
[50:11] euros. The same way I I have uh bitcoin
[50:15] as bigger and bit bigger and bigger uh
[50:19] income and expense stream actually. But
[50:21] still all my prices, all the all my
[50:24] relationships with the partners,
[50:25] everything is always denominated usually
[50:27] in euros or dollars.
[50:31] So because the reference point now with
[50:34] US dollar is still very
[50:37] relevant and is in the Bitcoin standard
[50:39] not relevant. What would you say would
[50:42] be the Bitcoin price under a Bitcoin
[50:46] standard if it would make sense to value
[50:49] it in today's uh dollars terms and you
[50:52] mentioned $100 million so I was like
[50:55] maybe you you're looking at that that
[50:56] price point.
[50:58] Yeah. Um well obviously 100 million um
[51:02] is a kind of convenient price point
[51:05] because you know one bitcoin is 100
[51:08] million satoshi's. Uh so it's it's a
[51:11] very even way of kind of balancing it
[51:15] against um existing fiat currencies. Uh
[51:19] but I think um we're going to get closer
[51:22] and closer towards that. um you know Hal
[51:26] Finny for example right near the
[51:28] beginning of um uh Bitcoin I think it
[51:32] was uh around 2010 or so um or actually
[51:36] might have been 2009 he actually
[51:38] suggested that um if you take the value
[51:43] of all the wealth in the world or all
[51:46] the assets in the world and divide it by
[51:48] the number of Bitcoin then you get uh a
[51:51] price target of $10 million per Bitcoin.
[51:55] And this is when Bitcoin actually had
[51:58] zero dollar value that he was saying
[52:00] this. Bitcoin was literally zero
[52:03] dollars. It was free. Essentially,
[52:05] Bitcoin was free at the point that um uh
[52:09] Hal Finny was saying this. So to have
[52:11] that kind of vision, he was also the
[52:14] first person to talk about um you know
[52:17] layer 2s and um bit the necessity for
[52:21] Bitcoin banks essentially the
[52:23] financialization of of of Bitcoin um
[52:26] because he imagined in the future that
[52:28] most people would not be transacting
[52:30] directly on uh the base chain. So this
[52:33] shows you how uh intelligent and
[52:36] visionary Hal Finny was from the very
[52:39] beginning. It's just so unfortunate that
[52:41] he he uh he died, you know, in the early
[52:43] days of Bitcoin because he would be a
[52:45] really great proponent and Bitcoin
[52:47] thinker now. I mean, I think the only
[52:49] other person I can think of with that
[52:50] kind of vision about Bitcoin that early
[52:52] on uh would probably be be uh Nick Zabo
[52:57] um himself because he he uh you know
[53:00] he's he's the one who came up with the
[53:01] concept of Bit Gold and Bit Gold was
[53:05] before Bitcoin. was around well uh at
[53:08] least several years before Bitcoin that
[53:10] he came up with the concept of bit gold
[53:12] and bit gold anticipated um layer 2
[53:16] technologies that you wouldn't actually
[53:18] transact on the bit bit gold uh layer
[53:22] one but you would need a layer two on
[53:24] top of the bit gold. Uh so he he has a a
[53:28] very good uh vision uh economically and
[53:32] financially of of of Bitcoin. If you
[53:34] read any of his writings, like his essay
[53:36] shelling out about the history of money,
[53:39] um he really understands the uh
[53:42] economics of Bitcoin, uh yeah, $10
[53:45] million was was a proposal around like
[53:48] 15 years ago. Uh I know Michael Sailor
[53:51] has his base case that by
[53:55] 2045, I think it is, Bitcoin will be uh
[53:59] $13 million. Uh but he does if I if I
[54:03] recall have a um an actual bull case as
[54:07] well which is multiples of that. I don't
[54:09] remember if it's like probably 30 40 50
[54:12] million uh or bitcoin uh by
[54:17] 2045. Um so you know yeah if we can um
[54:24] denominate everything in the world in
[54:26] bitcoin if we can or if bitcoin even
[54:28] takes um like sailor suggests I think he
[54:31] suggests something like 7% of all the
[54:34] wealth in the world I mean even then
[54:37] bitcoin is at a massive price but if
[54:38] bitcoin is the prime savings vehicle and
[54:43] if it is the standard the monetary
[54:45] standard for the planet and everything
[54:47] is denominated ated in Bitcoin then uh
[54:51] the price in terms of dollars uh would
[54:55] be enormous um and it would approach you
[54:58] know closer to $100 million than it's
[55:02] difficult to say because obviously the
[55:03] wealth in the world keeps growing. So if
[55:07] you ever make these calculations, you
[55:09] have to change them again. And you know,
[55:11] also there's the the relative value of
[55:13] the fiat currencies. It's very very
[55:15] difficult to actually say what is that
[55:18] figure if you take all the wealth in the
[55:20] world and calculate backwards based on
[55:23] that. Um so yeah, it's it's uh it's a
[55:26] bit difficult to say what the price
[55:28] would be even even what would be the
[55:30] price of Bitcoin reaching gold par
[55:33] that's another question because that
[55:35] keeps changing as well. you know, a few
[55:36] years ago, uh, it would have been, you
[55:39] know, much less, maybe, you know,
[55:41] $400,000 per Bitcoin or $500,000 per
[55:44] Bitcoin. Now, it's getting close to a
[55:47] million, you know. So, if if you wanted
[55:50] gold to have the same market cap or
[55:52] Bitcoin to have the same market cap as
[55:54] gold, uh, then Bitcoin would be closer
[55:58] to a million dollars. Now uh and that
[56:01] that might keep increasing if the value
[56:03] of gold goes up because you don't have
[56:05] to to denominate uh bitcoin in dollars
[56:09] you know as you say it's a very
[56:11] convenient method it's even an argument
[56:13] some people use against bitcoin how you
[56:15] know how does bitcoin have any value if
[56:17] you have to you know exchange it for
[56:19] dollars you know isn't it just based on
[56:21] the dollar then if you have to exchange
[56:22] it for dollars but you can you can
[56:24] exchange it for gold you can exchange it
[56:26] for ounces of gold there's a certain
[56:28] number of ounces of gold. That's
[56:30] equivalent to one Bitcoin. And that has
[56:32] been also going up over time. If you
[56:35] look at a chart of Bitcoin versus gold,
[56:39] the value of Bitcoin goes up against
[56:41] gold. I think at the moment, Bitcoin is
[56:44] probably very undervalued in its gold
[56:47] value. So, I think uh it has a huge I
[56:50] don't even think we're in necessarily
[56:52] anywhere near like bull market territory
[56:55] in terms of its uh its gold value
[56:56] because I think the go the value of gold
[56:58] has gone up and Bitcoin hasn't caught up
[57:01] uh necessarily in this cycle yet. It's
[57:04] it's caught up maybe in fiat terms but
[57:07] not in um uh in in gold terms yet. So
[57:11] there's a huge amount of growth to go I
[57:13] think in in terms of gold value of of
[57:16] Bitcoin. But yeah, so you can denominate
[57:19] Bitcoin in gold, you can denominate it
[57:20] in dollars, but at the end of the day,
[57:23] that's all kind of artificial. As I
[57:25] said, you can denom you can fix the
[57:27] price of of Bitcoin against dollars if
[57:29] you want. You can change the VA the
[57:31] number of dollars that are convertible
[57:33] into one Bitcoin. So ultimately, what is
[57:35] the value in purchasing power or the
[57:38] ability to buy things? And I think that
[57:40] will always go up in value over time
[57:43] regardless of what the exchange rate is
[57:45] because the wealth of mankind will go up
[57:48] over time. And Bitcoin a as a result
[57:51] being this fixed asset will go up in
[57:53] value. So under a Bitcoin standard, it
[57:55] will have a huge value that we can't
[57:57] even necessarily compute at the moment.
[58:00] It's a good thing. Yeah. And that's why
[58:02] we always have to say in today's tallest
[58:05] durhams we also have the from Jesse
[58:08] Meyers the model of what's the wealth in
[58:11] the world and he basically would need to
[58:13] update that that model probably every
[58:16] year because it keeps getting bigger the
[58:18] numbers because the underlying asset
[58:20] that we measuring it in uh the US dollar
[58:24] or euro whatever it is um is getting
[58:28] devalued so everything else gets gets
[58:30] higher. So it's it's a it's a really
[58:32] good insight. That's why I really do
[58:34] like to compare Bitcoin with gold. If
[58:38] you actually go ahead and say what is
[58:40] one kilogram, one ounce, what what
[58:43] whatever the the weight of of one uh bar
[58:46] gold is, what is that? How much Bitcoin
[58:49] do I need to buy that? Do I need one
[58:51] bitcoin? Do I need 0.1 bitcoin? And
[58:54] denominate basically the bitcoin price
[58:57] in gold. And and I think at that point
[59:00] you get a way more realistic price of
[59:04] what Bitcoin actually is outside of the
[59:08] devaluation because there's two reasons
[59:10] why Bitcoin is growing in in in in in
[59:13] price. One is the devaluation of the
[59:15] underlying fiat currencies. That's why
[59:18] we see uh Bitcoin reaching faster
[59:21] all-time highs in the Argentine peso in
[59:23] the Turkish lera because those are just
[59:26] even worse feared
[59:28] currencies. And the other thing is
[59:30] Bitcoin is getting adopted as a network.
[59:33] I'm orange building a person, he comes
[59:35] on the network, I'm orange another one,
[59:37] they're coming on the network. the more
[59:39] people understand why Bitcoin is
[59:41] superior and the asset just grows in its
[59:44] network and that's why it also is
[59:46] growing. So there's like two aspects to
[59:48] it. It's kind of the monetization part
[59:52] of it and the devaluation part of what
[59:55] we are measuring in it. So that's it's
[59:58] always so funny. Uh I I was at a
[60:01] conference and someone asked me like oh
[60:03] do you think Bitcoin can reach 10
[60:04] million? And I was like of course oh 100
[60:06] million of course. Yeah. What about a
[60:09] billion? Yeah. Like at some point the
[60:12] dollars will be devalued and so it goes
[60:14] to infinity in theory. So we will reach
[60:16] all the prices from zero to infinity at
[60:19] some point because it's just like at
[60:21] some point it it does not even make
[60:24] sense to to measure it in. I had one
[60:26] guest on I think he was the most
[60:28] bullish. He said you will be able to buy
[60:32] an a spaceship with one Satoshi.
[60:35] uh uh but but he didn't put a time frame
[60:38] on it. It's just like uh one one mission
[60:42] one vision that he he looks at. Well, I
[60:44] I'm not sure about that. That's a bit
[60:46] optimistic once Satoshi.
[60:49] Yeah, it's it's it's it's basically the
[60:52] theory. I mean, at that point, we are uh
[60:55] not only on Earth, we expanded the
[60:57] species and uh he said like we we
[61:01] we that episode was so fun. He basically
[61:04] said, "We we put solar panels all around
[61:07] the the sun uh I think on Mercury or
[61:10] something like that." It was uh to use
[61:12] it for Bitcoin mining and scale. Yeah.
[61:16] Yeah. Yeah. That's taking us to type
[61:20] something or other on the Kardashev
[61:22] scale. There's this Kardashev scale. I
[61:23] don't remember what what's on the Kadash
[61:25] scale, but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[61:27] Yeah. There's type zero till four. I
[61:30] think I think the type four is the most
[61:33] advanced one, but I'm also not an
[61:34] expert. Like I don't know what I just
[61:36] know that we are not even one yet. Yeah,
[61:38] I know. We could I could probably look
[61:40] it up, but yeah. Yeah, it's not
[61:41] something I know off the top of my head,
[61:42] but yeah. Well, in terms of that, I mean
[61:44] uh that's why I like the book um The
[61:47] Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth. I don't
[61:49] know if you read that but he talks about
[61:51] this kind of um you know explosion of
[61:54] technology and artificial intelligence
[61:57] and all of this stuff that will actually
[61:59] make naturally uh it makes everything
[62:03] get cheaper over time. So ultimately
[62:06] that's another aspect you know bitcoin
[62:08] goes up in value because of its you know
[62:10] scarcity and demand for that scarce
[62:13] asset but at the same time if technology
[62:16] is massively improving uh the price of
[62:20] things should be going down and it's
[62:22] also something that say mentions in his
[62:25] book um principles of economics which I
[62:27] found quite interesting as well that you
[62:29] know we're basically getting better and
[62:30] better at producing things. It's not
[62:33] getting more expensive to produce food
[62:36] or, you know, to to get oil and all
[62:38] these other assets. Over time, every
[62:41] resource that we have gets cheaper to
[62:44] acquire. And technology gets cheaper
[62:46] over time as well. I mean, a computer,
[62:49] you know, used to be incredibly
[62:50] expensive. You know, one megabyte used
[62:52] to be really expensive. You have one
[62:53] megabyte of data. And now one megabyte
[62:56] of data is nothing. You've got gigabytes
[62:57] of data. So yeah, ultimately your
[63:01] Bitcoin purchasing power should go up uh
[63:05] even in terms of everything getting
[63:08] cheaper over time. So that's another way
[63:10] that the value of bit Bitcoin can go up
[63:12] besides uh obviously devaluation of fiat
[63:15] currencies, but also everything becoming
[63:17] cheaper through technology leading to
[63:20] Bitcoin being able to buy more things.
[63:24] Yeah, absolutely. It's it's a good
[63:26] point. And one thing that I also had in
[63:28] mind
[63:30] um the the way we get to this uh Bitcoin
[63:33] standard is because we have now nation
[63:37] states already involved in Bitcoin and
[63:39] being friendly to Bitcoin that we have
[63:43] kind of a a soft landing adoption or a
[63:47] peaceful adoption of Bitcoin versus a
[63:51] hard reset because nation states already
[63:54] trying to incorporate Bitcoin and So
[63:57] softly smoothly transitioning, maybe I'm
[64:00] just dreaming here, but softly smoothly
[64:02] transitioning to a bitcoin standard.
[64:04] Yeah. Well, I think we've got good
[64:06] indications of that. Um I think it was a
[64:10] critical moment when uh President Trump
[64:14] was elected. Um, I think even the fact
[64:17] that um, you know, he survived that
[64:20] assassination attempt, you know, there's
[64:22] lots of memes about it on on X or
[64:24] Twitter that, you know, have you seen
[64:27] the ones where, uh, his head is turned
[64:29] one way and then it's turned a different
[64:31] way and it's like, you know, one is, you
[64:33] know, uh, $200,000 Bitcoin or one is
[64:37] another, you know, there's lots of
[64:38] versions of this this meme because all
[64:40] it took was him turning to look at a
[64:44] diagram that he had on a screen and the
[64:47] bullet at that moment just grazed past
[64:50] uh his head and you know hit his ear
[64:52] basically caused his ear to bleed. But
[64:55] if his head was turned the other way, it
[64:57] would have the bullet would have gone
[64:58] straight through his skull and out the
[65:00] other side and he would have died
[65:02] instantly. So it it's interesting that
[65:04] it's almost like you know the the fate
[65:07] of the world or or future human history
[65:10] was kind of just resting on that moment
[65:13] when he turned his head. So you do
[65:16] wonder we we'd be somewhere different
[65:18] perhaps if he wasn't elected and the US
[65:21] decided not to establish a Bitcoin
[65:24] strategic reserve because you know his
[65:25] his opponent um didn't even want to come
[65:29] to the Bitcoin conference and you know
[65:32] basically refused to to do anything
[65:35] related to Bitcoin uh presumably because
[65:38] she realized that her own policies were
[65:41] not in any way aligned with the policies
[65:43] of Bitcoin. So what's the point? like
[65:44] what's the point of coming to the
[65:45] Bitcoin conference if you've got nothing
[65:48] positive to say about Bitcoin? So, uh it
[65:53] is interesting that you know sometimes
[65:55] history comes down to these these
[65:58] moments where something critical happens
[66:01] that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
[66:04] One person lives instead of dying, one
[66:06] person gets elected instead of another
[66:08] person. You know, so many things like
[66:10] that. I mean, you know, even if you
[66:11] think in terms of British history, um,
[66:15] you know, Henry VIII's
[66:17] son, eldest son was Prince Arthur. He
[66:21] was the he was the one who was meant to
[66:22] lead. His second son, Henry, was meant
[66:25] to become a priest and just go into the
[66:28] church and all of that. What happens?
[66:30] You know, Arthur dies. Uh, Henry becomes
[66:33] Henry VIII and Henry VIII does
[66:37] everything that he did, you know,
[66:38] establishing the Church of England and
[66:39] and breaking away from Rome and changing
[66:42] the course of history. But just because
[66:44] one person died and another person
[66:46] lived, you know, the whole history of
[66:48] Britain has changed, the whole future of
[66:50] of England uh changed based on that one
[66:54] person dying and another person living.
[66:56] So the same thing's happening with with
[66:58] Trump being elected whether or not you
[66:59] support Trump or like Trump or think
[67:02] he's a good person or not. You know,
[67:04] he's changing history just by by being
[67:07] president. So yeah, in terms of what
[67:09] you're saying, would it would we have
[67:11] this soft landing um or will we have a
[67:15] hard reset? It's still to be decided. I
[67:19] think I think we're we're on a good path
[67:22] now in terms of the US potentially
[67:25] acquiring you know at least a million
[67:28] more Bitcoin than they currently have
[67:30] potentially and uh you know potentially
[67:33] going in the direction of a uh Bitcoin
[67:35] standard and maybe wiping out the debt
[67:37] and maybe doing this and that the other.
[67:40] Uh but that's not written in stone yet.
[67:44] you know, things could still happen that
[67:46] push America in a different direction.
[67:49] You know, you could still have
[67:50] potentially, you know, World War II
[67:53] scenario. You could have all sorts of
[67:55] things could happen um in history. I
[67:58] mean, even now there's tensions between
[67:59] India and Pakistan, both nuclear
[68:02] nations. Anything can happen. You know,
[68:03] what will happen between China and the
[68:06] US in their tariff war? Um so many
[68:09] scenarios. So there's a possibility that
[68:13] we get to a stage where the the US debt
[68:16] is not solved and uh the US dollar
[68:21] becomes hyperinflated and collapses and
[68:24] the government could collapse and all
[68:27] sorts of things could happen. Uh and
[68:29] then Bitcoin does go to infinity dollars
[68:32] if the dollar you know becomes worthless
[68:35] essentially. So there's no exchange
[68:37] rate. Then the dollar is just one
[68:39] bitcoin is infinite dollars at that
[68:41] point. Uh or the US could say you know
[68:44] let's establish a bitcoin standard and
[68:47] this is the exchange rate between
[68:49] bitcoin and the dollar. In that case
[68:51] bitcoin doesn't go to infinity dollars
[68:53] because the dollar has a fixed price in
[68:56] bitcoin. So bitcoin can keep going up in
[68:59] value but the dollar exchange rate
[69:01] doesn't change. Uh so there's lots of
[69:05] possibilities. Uh I think it's good to
[69:07] be optimistic at this stage, but
[69:09] anything could happen and we could still
[69:11] end up in a uh kind of um dystopian
[69:15] situation or or hyper bitcoinization
[69:17] situation.
[69:19] I I I 100% agree and
[69:22] I I have I think the next US election so
[69:28] we'll have we had the last one now 204
[69:31] next one will be
[69:33] 2028 it will be between two candidates
[69:37] of both political eyes that will fight
[69:41] for who is most bullish on Bitcoin. They
[69:44] they will fight for the Bitcoin voting
[69:46] plug. It surprised me that at this
[69:50] election we already had kind
[69:53] of not a fight for the Bitcoin vote, but
[69:56] more of like one candidate really wanted
[70:00] the Bitcoin voting block. So now it's
[70:03] only logical for me 4 years down the
[70:06] road with all the developments that will
[70:08] happen in the next four years for
[70:10] Bitcoin that the same thing on both
[70:13] sides will have to happen because
[70:15] Bitcoiners will just be such a huge
[70:19] amount of voters that you cannot miss.
[70:22] And Bitcoiners are also very passionate
[70:24] about their Bitcoin. If you if you if
[70:27] you speak ill about my Bitcoin, I will
[70:30] hate you.
[70:31] So it it will be very bad for one
[70:35] candidate to openly speak bad about
[70:37] Bitcoin. So why not embrace it and say
[70:41] good things about it to maybe persuade
[70:43] the one or the other Bitcoiner from
[70:45] Republican to
[70:46] Democrats because there will be maybe
[70:49] Republicans voted that voted Trump for
[70:52] for Bitcoin and now they are uh they're
[70:54] like ah terrorists and all like
[70:56] maybe they like some some things of him
[70:59] not they like hey there's like a
[71:02] Democrat candidate that I really enjoyed
[71:05] and I like and he's also for Bitcoin and
[71:07] he likes Bitcoin. So I think game theory
[71:09] is very clear that uh from now on the US
[71:13] will have I mean maybe maybe I'm
[71:16] dreaming again but from now on the US
[71:18] will have pro Bitcoin uh candidates and
[71:23] presidencies and this is something
[71:27] amazing. I mean, on on the right side,
[71:29] Republican, we probably already have a
[71:31] candidate a candidate with with JD
[71:34] Vance, I guess, that that will will be
[71:37] pro Bitcoin. Uh, and then we we see what
[71:40] what the Democrat side comes up with, I
[71:43] heard, with AOC and how that old man
[71:47] called Bernie Sanders. Yeah, Bernie
[71:50] Sanders. Yeah. But I I don't think I I
[71:53] hope for the Democrat party that those
[71:54] two are not doing it. I don't know if if
[71:57] uh if it would be would be good, but
[71:59] yeah, maybe maybe also um but yeah, my
[72:02] my thing is like there's no turning back
[72:05] now for the US for being pro Bitcoin.
[72:07] Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I mean uh well,
[72:09] yeah, it's difficult to say who else
[72:11] will be running in uh 2028. But yeah, JD
[72:16] Vance, as far as I'm aware, uh he had
[72:19] disclosed uh owning I think it was
[72:23] around six Bitcoin, something like that.
[72:27] Uh and this is long before Trump became
[72:30] pro Bitcoin. So certainly JD Vance is a
[72:33] Bitcoiner, although I've not heard him
[72:36] I've not seen any speeches or anything
[72:39] where he's talking about Bitcoin or
[72:41] anything like that. So I think I'm not
[72:43] I'm not really sure what his exact views
[72:46] are on Bitcoin. He seems to have been in
[72:48] the background so far with all that
[72:50] stuff. It's been Trump talking and then
[72:52] obviously the commerce secretary,
[72:54] Treasury Secretary, crypto aisar, those
[72:57] guys speaking. So maybe someone else has
[72:59] has some has seen some clips or
[73:01] something where he talks about Bitcoin.
[73:03] So I'm not sure what his views are on
[73:04] Bitcoin, but I believe he's pro Bitcoin
[73:08] uh as far as I'm aware. So yeah, I think
[73:09] there's no putting the genie back in the
[73:11] bottle in that sense. I think with
[73:14] governments and and government
[73:16] systems, it's very difficult to change
[73:20] once something is put into existence
[73:22] once once something is created. Well,
[73:24] probably the biggest example is maybe
[73:26] the Federal Reserve. You know, uh the
[73:28] Federal Reserve was created in 1913, I
[73:31] think 1913, just before uh World War I
[73:35] started. And um you know there's been no
[73:40] push or no means to eliminate it so far.
[73:43] In theory I think it could just be
[73:44] eliminated through an an act of
[73:47] Congress. Uh they just just have to sort
[73:49] of repeal the Federal Reserve Act, I
[73:51] think, and then there's no more Federal
[73:53] Reserve. But why hasn't that happened in
[73:55] in more than 110 years? because there's
[73:59] not it's very difficult to to put things
[74:03] back the way that they were beforehand.
[74:06] Um the same thing I think with in the UK
[74:08] with the NHS for example. the NHS, you
[74:12] know, was created after World War II uh
[74:14] by the uh I think it was the Labor Party
[74:18] um and obviously Churchill uh was booted
[74:21] out of power and then he got reelected
[74:24] um I think in the next election but he
[74:27] didn't get rid of the NHS and the NHS
[74:29] has existed up till now and nobody is
[74:33] against it because it's almost like
[74:35] political suicide to say oh let's
[74:37] abolish the NHS or even even private
[74:40] izing the NHS that's almost political
[74:42] suicide. There's so much um kind of
[74:46] support for the National Health Service
[74:48] in in the UK. So it's it's like that
[74:50] it's difficult once things come into
[74:52] existence to get rid of them. The
[74:54] Bitcoin strategic reserve uh is still
[74:56] very young at this stage. So it's kind
[74:58] of maybe vulnerable at the moment. It
[75:01] could be reversed especially if there's
[75:03] no legislation in place to preserve it.
[75:06] I think that's the key thing at the
[75:08] moment now is getting something like uh
[75:11] Cynthia Lumis' Bitcoin Act to be passed
[75:14] by Congress because then that can kind
[75:16] of enshrine
[75:18] uh the Bitcoin uh strategic reserve into
[75:22] law and then it becomes very difficult
[75:25] because then you have to get both houses
[75:27] of Congress to repeal that act in order
[75:31] to get rid of it. just like the Federal
[75:33] Reserve Act or the Social Social Social
[75:35] Security or any of these other uh
[75:38] institutions, it's very difficult to get
[75:39] rid of them once they're created. Even
[75:42] Obamacare, which uh you know,
[75:45] Republicans were against, uh it still
[75:47] exists in some form now. They they've
[75:50] not been able to completely reverse it
[75:52] yet. So once it gets into law, it's
[75:55] difficult to get rid of. So, I think
[75:57] that's the key thing now. Getting some
[75:58] of these things into law, like the
[76:01] Bitcoin strategic reserve, like Trump's
[76:04] sovereign wealth fund, all this kind of
[76:06] stuff needs to be legislated. And once
[76:09] it's legislated, the next president is
[76:12] unlikely to come and say, "Okay, I'm
[76:13] abolishing the uh Bitcoin strategic
[76:16] reserve and selling all the Bitcoin." I
[76:18] think it's an an amazing point. And um
[76:22] we
[76:23] we I I'm really curious also now like um
[76:26] of of how this Bitcoin standard will be
[76:30] and how you look at uh what are the
[76:32] implications of that. Uh but we have
[76:34] already further down the the podcast
[76:36] road. Maybe that's a topic we can pick
[76:38] up in the third round. And for everyone
[76:41] that uh didn't see I this is already the
[76:45] second round with with Nicolas. So, I
[76:48] just want to share that quickly with
[76:50] people if you want to hear more. Um, we
[76:52] we had a really fun talk uh uh w with
[76:56] with you um just a year ago. And it was
[76:59] also it was also fun because the price
[77:01] was a lot less back then. Not a lot
[77:04] less, but quite substantial less. I
[77:06] think it was like half the price or
[77:07] something like that. Uh and and a
[77:09] million now seems almost more reachable
[77:12] because we already hit over 100k. And it
[77:15] also was a video where we actually
[77:16] talked about the 100k mark as far as I
[77:19] remember uh being some some kind of
[77:22] emotional trigger. So it's it's it's fun
[77:25] to go to go back in history and and see
[77:29] see what we uh what we fought back then.
[77:32] And uh we have a new uh end question. I
[77:36] mean, we have an entertaining question
[77:37] that's also the same, but one uh
[77:40] question that I ask each and every one
[77:41] of my guests that comes on the podcast
[77:44] again. And the question is, what have
[77:46] you learned outside of Bitcoin since you
[77:49] last been on the podcast? Well, since
[77:51] I've last been on the podcast, that's a
[77:52] difficult uh question. Obviously, so
[77:55] much has changed um in terms of Bitcoin.
[77:59] Do you mean just in terms of Bitcoin or
[78:00] in terms of like anything? Oh, no.
[78:03] Actually, outside of Bitcoin. So, so,
[78:05] uh, because I'm I'm really curious what
[78:07] what Bitcoin has also spent the time
[78:10] with. And usually my first question, if
[78:12] someone was not on the podcast, I'm
[78:14] asking like, oh, what can we learn from
[78:16] you besides Bitcoin? And now with
[78:19] returning guests, I'm asking, what have
[78:21] you learned outside of Bitcoin since you
[78:23] last been on? It can be very small like
[78:26] it doesn't have to be world changing but
[78:29] something that that that you have picked
[78:30] out because I'm just curious what are
[78:33] bitcoiners spending their time on
[78:36] outside of of of of talking and thinking
[78:39] about bitcoin. Yeah, I mean that's a
[78:41] good question. I mean my interests
[78:43] perhaps are very uh have sort of very
[78:46] narrow interests maybe in a I mean, I
[78:48] like things like um history, so I'm, you
[78:51] know, always watching like history
[78:53] documentaries and reading books and
[78:56] stuff. I mean, obviously, I read a lot
[78:57] about Bitcoin and think about Bitcoin
[78:59] quite a bit as well. Yeah, I you know,
[79:02] I'm I'm quite into sort of uh you know,
[79:06] reading about um the history of religion
[79:10] and religious ideas as well. Well, I
[79:12] mean that's something that uh you know I
[79:14] think about quite a lot in terms of um
[79:17] you know uh that society needs to
[79:22] develop um not just materially but also
[79:26] in terms of the development of uh virtue
[79:30] and morality and uh you know being uh
[79:34] being a good society. I don't think it's
[79:37] enough just to fix the money. Uh that's
[79:41] something that you know I think about
[79:42] quite a bit that yeah I mean Bitcoin you
[79:44] can say for any number of problems that
[79:48] Bitcoin fixes this um but it doesn't fix
[79:53] necessarily the um uh the culture and
[79:58] the morals and values of a people. Um
[80:01] and that's something I think about quite
[80:02] a bit is you know what what are the
[80:04] actual morals and values of a society or
[80:08] a civilization. Um, and I've, you know,
[80:11] I did write about, you know, how, uh,
[80:15] similar to Safer Dean's ideas, how, you
[80:17] know, Bitcoin can fix civilization in
[80:20] many ways, but I think fundamentally,
[80:24] uh, it's about fixing people's
[80:27] characters and their behaviors and being
[80:30] a good and moral society. Interesting. I
[80:34] I I love that. And this is exactly where
[80:37] I we really have to do do a sec a third
[80:41] round then with like what are the
[80:42] implications of Bitcoin and and and how
[80:44] do we get to an good Bitcoin standard.
[80:47] Um but yeah thank you so much. We have
[80:49] an end as you know from the in the
[80:51] podcast where the previous guest is
[80:53] asking a question for the next guest
[80:54] without knowing who the next guest
[80:55] actually is and the question for you
[80:57] today is do you consider Bitcoin to be
[81:00] an invention or a discovery and why? Oh,
[81:04] okay. That's a good question. Uh, well,
[81:06] I think actually um the uh Bitcoin as a
[81:12] uh protocol and uh as a solution to
[81:17] let's say the Byzantine general's
[81:18] problem and and all of that. I think
[81:20] that is u I think the actual um Bitcoin
[81:26] code and blockchain Bitcoin as it as it
[81:30] is is an invention. uh but certain
[81:33] aspects of it like um the concept of uh
[81:39] digital scarcity or absolute scarcity
[81:42] um is a discovery. So I think you have
[81:46] to take the abstract from the particular
[81:49] you know the particular uh code and
[81:53] system that we use was invented by
[81:55] Satoshi Nakamoto um whoever he may be
[81:59] but the ideas behind it um could have
[82:04] been discovered by somebody else and
[82:07] they would it would have been at some
[82:08] point even if Satoshi Nakamoto had not
[82:12] invented Bitcoin in let's say 2008 when
[82:15] he was I think might have been a bit
[82:17] earlier as well because he he said he he
[82:19] he took I think it was like a year or a
[82:21] year and a half to actually code uh
[82:23] Bitcoin. So it might have been like 2007
[82:26] or even earlier possibly. But his
[82:28] discovery of how to uh solve the
[82:32] Byzantine general's problem and how to
[82:35] create this digital absolute scarcity uh
[82:39] that could have been discovered by
[82:41] someone else. It just happens to be that
[82:43] Bitcoin was the implementation of that
[82:46] and because it's the first and it had
[82:49] that kind of immaculate conception.
[82:51] Bitcoin is the digital scarcity that we
[82:54] have and it can't be replicated because
[82:56] it's it's being done once and you can't
[82:59] really replicate the circumstances that
[83:01] led to the creation of Bitcoin and the
[83:03] the gradual growth and adoption of
[83:05] Bitcoin. So, you can't really replicate
[83:07] that. But had it not been created by
[83:10] him, then it could have been created by
[83:14] someone else in a slightly different way
[83:17] with a different name, different code,
[83:20] etc., but it still would have solved the
[83:23] uh the same problems as Bitcoin. So that
[83:26] digital scarcity and that ledger,
[83:29] distributed ledger and the solution to
[83:31] the Byzantine general's problem, those
[83:33] things were discovered, I think, because
[83:35] they're kind of abstract. Yeah, it's
[83:37] it's a good way to to
[83:39] to take it apart of like uh what was uh
[83:44] discovered and what is kind of the
[83:46] invention behind it and not just like
[83:48] put the whole thing in in in one
[83:50] category. That's that's really good. Um
[83:52] yeah, thank you so much Nicholas. Before
[83:53] I let you go, where can people find you,
[83:55] ask questions and and reach out to you?
[83:57] Uh well, mainly through Twitter, I
[83:59] think. Um Nicholas 19 on Twitter on X as
[84:04] they now call it. Um, obviously I've got
[84:07] uh that blog on Medium uh which I think
[84:10] you'll have a link to. Um, but yeah, I
[84:13] think that's that's probably the best
[84:14] place to contact me um in the first
[84:16] instance.
[84:18] Absolutely. Really cool. Thank you so
[84:20] much for your time and also thank you so
[84:21] much for everyone that is watching and
[84:23] listening for joining us today. As
[84:24] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[84:26] another episode. Bye-bye. Thank you.
