[00:00] welcome my friends to the Bitcoin path
[00:02] today's guest is Tony AK Vendetta
[00:06] together with him we are going to
[00:08] explore why it is so important to store
[00:11] your Bitcoin safely and how it can help
[00:15] you protect you from everything
[00:17] happening in the world I enjoyed the
[00:19] conversation a lot and I hope you will
[00:22] too hello uh Tony how are you very good
[00:25] man how are
[00:26] you amazing it's uh I like doing this
[00:30] podcast it's my uh my second one and uh
[00:32] the first one was really really really
[00:34] great and I'm looking forward to the the
[00:36] second episode Excellent Man same here
[00:39] happy to be
[00:40] here so as a first starter I always like
[00:44] to uh start uh especially with
[00:47] bitcoiners why are they in Bitcoin like
[00:50] what what brought them there why are
[00:52] they so passionate about it what what
[00:53] what was the moment maybe uh what was
[00:56] the aha moment for you why even bother
[00:59] with the Bitcoin right now well my aha
[01:02] moment unfortunately came from a from a
[01:05] place of pain after having witnessed a
[01:07] complete obliteration of an entire
[01:09] country's life savings in uh in Lebanon
[01:12] three years ago um when you see
[01:15] something you know that devastating it's
[01:18] very hard to unsee it and not question
[01:21] what caused it and that leads you very
[01:23] quickly down a rabbit hole um to
[01:26] understanding you know that everything
[01:28] we've known about money since the
[01:30] beginning since since the day I was born
[01:32] was a complete farce it was a complete
[01:34] lie it's a rig it's a scam it's a Ponzi
[01:36] scheme you can call it whatever you like
[01:38] it's complete rubbish and when you're
[01:40] born into a system like this it's hard
[01:42] to imagine that it's not that because
[01:45] that's all you've ever known until it
[01:48] you know becomes bad enough that you
[01:49] know it completely starts falling apart
[01:52] and you become you know the casualty of
[01:54] its destruction and when you go through
[01:57] something like this believe me you will
[02:00] not go back to the very same source that
[02:03] put you in that position in the first
[02:05] place so that's what brought me into
[02:07] Bitcoin thankfully I found it because
[02:10] honestly the way things are going
[02:12] globally if we didn't have anything like
[02:16] Bitcoin um we're we're headed for a very
[02:18] dire future so um I'm very optimistic
[02:22] and thankful that we do have this this
[02:25] option this exit this insurance you can
[02:27] call it whatever you like but it is the
[02:30] light it is the hope that will
[02:32] preserve um you know every individual's
[02:35] values dignity honor and more
[02:38] importantly their freedom because it's
[02:40] the one asset that you can finally own
[02:42] that no one no matter what they what
[02:44] they want will be able to take away from
[02:46] you great and did you live at the time
[02:50] in Lebanon or had you any connection
[02:51] with it or no I did not live in Lebanon
[02:55] but I have a lot of friends and very
[02:57] close uh people to me that live there
[02:59] there that have to this day still not
[03:02] come out of the disaster that they've
[03:05] been put in um you have to understand I
[03:07] mean these are folks that you know have
[03:09] been working hard their entire lives
[03:12] with all their life savings in a bank
[03:14] account you know as they've been told is
[03:16] the way to go and then from one day to
[03:19] the next they woke up with absolutely
[03:22] nothing can you maybe quickly uh give
[03:25] for those who don't know what happened
[03:28] there exactly give a summary
[03:30] ation what happened there why cost why
[03:34] was it costed what it happened like a
[03:36] quick overview yeah of course I mean for
[03:39] the longest time lebanon's banking
[03:40] system was touted as you know the golden
[03:42] one of the golden examples to follow you
[03:44] know they had an extremely strong robust
[03:47] Financial system the banks were uh you
[03:50] know were running you know like like
[03:52] Champs and the the biggest perk about
[03:55] them which in hindsight now was the
[03:57] biggest red flag is that they were
[03:59] offering ing very high interest rates on
[04:01] your deposits so if you had a
[04:03] significant amount of life savings and
[04:05] you just left them in a bank account
[04:07] you'd be making anywhere between 7% up
[04:10] to 20% depending on the currency you had
[04:12] it in just by leaving it in a bank
[04:14] account and that's what a lot of people
[04:16] were doing because essentially at you
[04:18] know at that at those numbers you're
[04:20] living for free so if you if you're a
[04:22] high net worth individual let's say you
[04:23] have a million dollars you're making you
[04:25] know 7 to 20% a year well you know you
[04:28] it's a it's a it's a crazy living and so
[04:32] many folks you know fell into that trap
[04:34] into thinking you know that you know
[04:36] they're going to live like kings without
[04:37] any effort but very quickly realized
[04:40] that the only way to fund this Ponzi was
[04:44] from new people coming in being
[04:47] attracted into these interest rates and
[04:50] then eventually at one point you know
[04:51] the money dried up and when the money
[04:53] dried up well how are you going to pay
[04:54] these interest rates you can't and this
[04:56] is where the cracks start to happen and
[04:57] you know one thing leads to another and
[04:59] before you know it gets bad enough and
[05:01] boom you wake up one day credit cards no
[05:03] longer work you try to call the bank to
[05:05] find out you know what the hell happen
[05:06] there's no answer at the bank and you
[05:08] know a few a few days after that you
[05:11] realize that you know there's no access
[05:12] to your funds you're not allowed to
[05:14] withdraw your funds they're essentially
[05:16] gone you know seized seized by the bank
[05:18] for whatever reason that they
[05:21] give you and uh this is what happens so
[05:23] whether you're worth a dollar or a
[05:25] billion dollars the next day when this
[05:28] when this played out you were worth zero
[05:30] fascinating story um maybe to take a
[05:33] step back to you again
[05:36] um just to make sure uh everybody knows
[05:40] you what uh what was your background uh
[05:44] where did you come from I think you were
[05:46] in cyber security before are you still
[05:48] in there and what was your road before
[05:51] Bitcoin before you discovered it yes
[05:54] absolutely I come from about 25 years of
[05:56] cyber security encryption and privacy
[05:59] and I've been been in Bitcoin for uh say
[06:02] a little over six years now and I bring
[06:05] a lot of that knowledge you know into
[06:07] the Bitcoin into the Bitcoin space
[06:09] specifically with regards to the
[06:11] consults that we do at the Bitcoin way
[06:15] you know our mission there is to
[06:16] FastTrack the onboarding of as many
[06:18] folks as possible into proper Bitcoin
[06:21] self- custody and we do it you know by
[06:23] applying a lot of valuable you know best
[06:26] tips and practices from the cyber
[06:27] security world into the Bitcoin self
[06:30] custody space and that that would be
[06:33] maybe uh the best part to to uh to get
[06:37] it hooked now um how do you like when we
[06:42] established okay why is Bitcoin
[06:44] important the fear system is collapsing
[06:47] we have a savings technology where we
[06:49] can finally still uh trust in and save
[06:53] our financial energy in and when we when
[06:55] we have this in Bitcoin when we
[06:58] understand why the the second question
[07:01] is always how do I do it what's self-
[07:04] custody um what is like how do I manage
[07:08] my keys what uh Hardware wallets can I
[07:12] use like for a complete newbie maybe for
[07:15] someone that does not know anything
[07:17] about Bitcoin privacy that doesn't know
[07:20] anything about Bitcoin self custody
[07:22] where do this start how can you ensure
[07:26] an easy setup and
[07:29] where you can start for someone that is
[07:32] not really deep into it what would you
[07:35] recommend for them yeah I mean the the
[07:38] start of this journey always begins with
[07:40] a conversation we you know we offer a
[07:43] free 30 minute call to anyone that wants
[07:45] to you know chime in and inquire and ask
[07:48] all questions we like to begin the
[07:50] journey by making sure that you know
[07:52] there's a proper understanding around
[07:54] Bitcoin what it is what it represents
[07:56] why it's so important why it's so
[07:58] crucial
[07:59] that you know your people embrace it and
[08:02] adopt it as fast as possible and once
[08:04] you know that Foundation is is put into
[08:07] place then the way we make the journey
[08:09] easy is by handling all the technical
[08:12] aspects around Bitcoin uh most folks you
[08:15] know they uh they're petrified about you
[08:18] know doing anything that potentially
[08:22] risks losing their funds because
[08:25] although most people want to get into
[08:27] Bitcoin a lot of them are not Tech
[08:29] technically Savvy and that scares them
[08:32] so we remove that anxiety by handholding
[08:35] you know individuals through the entire
[08:37] process like we will guide you through
[08:39] all of it you know specifically by
[08:41] telling you all right you press here you
[08:42] do this you check this you uncheck that
[08:45] and within a very quick period of time
[08:47] you go from nothing to being completely
[08:49] bulletproof and airtight in every phase
[08:52] of that Journey so the first the first
[08:54] step of the way begins usually with a
[08:56] with a the hardware signing device we
[08:58] ensure that that you use a proper device
[09:01] we base we make recommendations based on
[09:03] open source or verifiable Source Gear
[09:05] that we have tested ourselves um we only
[09:09] recommend uh hardware and software that
[09:12] uh strictly adheres to the Bitcoin ethos
[09:14] or the Bitcoin y paper what that means
[09:16] is that any closed source project we
[09:18] immediately disqualify any project that
[09:21] uh does censorship on any level or
[09:23] collaborates with chain analysis on any
[09:25] level we automatically disqualify we
[09:28] don't take any shortcuts here and that
[09:29] applies to the cold wallet to the node
[09:32] to anything you know that has going to
[09:36] get involved in your bitco Bitcoin self-
[09:39] custody um package and where does uh
[09:43] privacy in non no KC play a role in that
[09:47] like how important is it to buy your
[09:51] Bitcoin at a place where you cannot be
[09:54] tracked or does it not matter like
[09:57] should you go with a centralized
[09:58] Exchange change where you identify
[10:00] yourself where you have light KC or um
[10:04] how can you do it with no KC um like how
[10:08] where's the where's the steps here well
[10:12] there there needs to be a fundamental
[10:14] understanding of what privacy is and why
[10:15] it really matters you know uh these days
[10:18] most people don't even think about it
[10:19] twice they don't care you know they're
[10:21] just very nonchalant about it and it's a
[10:24] very big problem um because we've never
[10:27] really had anything at like Bitcoin
[10:29] before okay like something so finite in
[10:32] Supply and so incredibly valuable
[10:34] because of its scarcity it it's not
[10:37] immediately available today perhaps but
[10:39] once the world understands this the
[10:43] panic and faux mode and money that's
[10:45] going to come into the Bitcoin space is
[10:47] going to send its value to parabolic
[10:51] levels we've never seen before um so the
[10:55] the dangers of kyc is that theyve it's
[10:57] been sold at as this thing to protect
[11:01] the consumer to protect you from losing
[11:03] your money where in fact there the truth
[11:06] about kyc is anything but the protection
[11:09] of the consumer kyc is was put in place
[11:13] for 100% control and surveillance of
[11:16] funds so that uh a small percentage of
[11:21] individuals who uh who want to play God
[11:25] will be able to surveil and control
[11:27] anything and everything you do with your
[11:29] money that's the co that's the that's
[11:31] the reason for kyc all right and the
[11:34] problem with it with an asset like
[11:36] Bitcoin is that if a centralized
[11:40] institution gets hacked and whoever
[11:44] hacked it gets access to a database with
[11:46] a name of list of everyone that's
[11:48] holding Bitcoin well then these people
[11:50] have a have a big problem potentially on
[11:52] their hands because as the value of
[11:54] Bitcoin continues to rise you know the
[11:57] attempts to steal it and go after it are
[11:59] going to rise along with it so if your
[12:01] name is on a list how do you deal with
[12:02] it if somebody targets you knowing that
[12:05] you have your Bitcoin this is where
[12:07] privacy comes in and there are tools
[12:09] that you can use to protect yourself
[12:12] protect your forward privacy now these
[12:14] are Advanced tools that are part of the
[12:15] Bitcoin ecosystem you know very popular
[12:18] one is known as a coin join where uh it
[12:21] breaks the heuristics between your
[12:23] Bitcoin that you purchased via kyc and
[12:25] it gives you forward privacy from that
[12:27] point on so it's essentially like taking
[12:29] cash out of a bank ATM the bank knows
[12:31] you took out whatever you took out but
[12:33] it has no clue what you did with it
[12:35] afterwards coin joint does essentially
[12:36] the exact same thing to your Bitcoin and
[12:39] a lot of folks are you know getting
[12:40] involved in it and it's important that
[12:42] they do if they care about their privacy
[12:45] now kyc is popular because it's
[12:47] convenient and most folks you know tend
[12:50] to opt for the the the the shortest the
[12:54] shortest way the laziest way without
[12:56] really thinking twice about it and
[12:58] that's because they don't put much value
[13:01] on to why the Privacy is important and
[13:04] why not like going not going the no kyc
[13:08] route could potentially backfire and so
[13:11] we provide the information for both the
[13:14] pros and cons for both the kyc approach
[13:16] and also the no kyc approach and those
[13:18] that are not familiar with the
[13:20] peer-to-peer buying of Bitcoin we show
[13:22] them how to do it um we're not a
[13:24] financial institution ourselves so we
[13:26] don't sell or buy any Bitcoin
[13:29] okay so we are just a Consulting service
[13:32] that essentially educates folks on
[13:35] what's out there and how to properly use
[13:37] it that's amazing so um for people that
[13:41] already have a lot of Bitcoin you are
[13:44] saying they should uh coin join or use
[13:47] some privacy tools to um ensure that
[13:52] even if they are on a list they have the
[13:55] right security level and for people that
[13:58] want to buy
[14:00] Bitcoin now or like in the future and
[14:03] the coming Bitcoin they are buying they
[14:06] should actually buy no KC on light KC
[14:12] especially no KC P2P I guess yeah well
[14:15] anyone that values their privacy and
[14:17] wants to protect it there are options
[14:20] available to them that's essentially
[14:21] what we present we don't necessarily
[14:24] tell anyone you have to do this we we
[14:26] present them with the options that are
[14:28] available able and you know what are the
[14:30] benefits of each and depending on each
[14:33] individual's um preferences and you know
[14:35] their objectives they will either um opt
[14:39] into one of one of them or they won't
[14:42] some folks you know they have their kyc
[14:44] and they leave it as such and they're
[14:46] fine so and other folks don't want to
[14:48] take that risk because they they've done
[14:50] the work into understanding the risks
[14:52] you know that come along with it they
[14:54] understand privacy they value privacy
[14:57] and they take the proper measure me to
[14:59] ensure it as much as possible when
[15:01] you're interacting peer-to-peer you're
[15:03] the you know there's no uh there's
[15:06] there's no giving up any identification
[15:09] or any paperwork or any questions for
[15:11] that matter you're dealing with you know
[15:13] an anonymous individual somewhere around
[15:14] the globe you know that's willing to
[15:16] sell or buy Bitcoin from you you know
[15:18] via VIA secure peer-to-peer transaction
[15:21] that's how it's
[15:23] done are the additional risks of buying
[15:26] Bitcoin
[15:27] KC rather than staying on a list and
[15:31] being a potential Target like uh on a
[15:33] state level maybe is there like you you
[15:36] are on a list and people when the the
[15:40] person centralized exchange gets hacked
[15:42] you can be seen how many Bitcoin you
[15:44] have uh this actually happened to myself
[15:48] already uh on on one specific hack um
[15:52] fortunately it was long time ago and
[15:54] that it was only a small amount of of of
[15:58] of my Bitcoin so uh I experienced that
[16:01] myself but I did not lose the Bitcoin uh
[16:04] and uh I did not have any other
[16:07] inconvenience to it other than staying
[16:10] on that public list that everybody can
[16:12] see that I have that much Bitcoin and
[16:14] especially when we consider that Bitcoin
[16:17] might be going parabolic in the next
[16:19] five to 10 years uh this could be a big
[16:22] amount and could could take a big Target
[16:26] on your back but other than that other
[16:28] additional risks to it to a kyc exchange
[16:32] um well if you leave your coins on an
[16:33] exchange yes there's absolutely a risk
[16:35] that you lose them if the exchange goes
[16:37] Bust or decides one day not to give it
[16:39] to you for whatever reason well then
[16:40] yeah you have a you have a big risk of
[16:42] losing your funds this is why even if
[16:45] you were to buy your Bitcoin from a
[16:47] centralized institution as soon as you
[16:49] buy it the the right action is to
[16:52] withdraw it instantly to proper self-
[16:55] custody so that it's in your possession
[16:57] so yeah I mean other than that no I
[17:00] don't see any other risk other than you
[17:02] know the the the database being hacked
[17:04] and your name is on a list or you
[17:06] forgetting or you're just being lazy and
[17:08] leaving your coins on an exchange for
[17:09] convenience and then you waking up one
[17:11] day and it's
[17:13] gone yeah I mean I mean uh not your keys
[17:16] not your coins is a principle in in
[17:19] Bitcoin that if you are in for a while
[17:22] you should get it like most I see
[17:25] actually people that have 100% in bit
[17:28] coin uh and leave it on Exchange uh that
[17:32] are not that savy in Bitcoin and I
[17:35] always tell them don't do that uh these
[17:38] are other reasons
[17:40] and maybe when maybe when you would
[17:44] summarize what are the main reasons for
[17:46] not doing that uh like the main reason
[17:49] for me would also be when the
[17:51] centralized exchain go bust your your
[17:54] coins are also gone like this is for me
[17:57] always the main reason
[17:59] but what are other reasons to do not
[18:01] leave your coins and an exchange for
[18:04] newer people
[18:06] especially well I mean if you leave your
[18:08] coins on an exchange it's essentially
[18:09] like leaving your money in a bank it
[18:11] does not belong to you A lot of people
[18:13] to this day still don't don't know or
[18:15] understand this that the money in your
[18:17] bank account is not yours it l it
[18:20] legally belongs to the bank and they
[18:22] technically owe you that money back but
[18:25] if they don't want to give it to you for
[18:27] whatever reason they don't have to and
[18:29] there's nothing you can do about it and
[18:31] it's the same the same concept applies
[18:33] to leaving your coins on an exchange you
[18:35] do not control it see it comes down at
[18:38] the end of the day it always comes down
[18:40] to you know owning your keys it's about
[18:42] control with regards to your money if
[18:44] it's not in your control it is 100% not
[18:49] yours regardless of the amount
[18:51] regardless of whether you think you're
[18:53] dealing with a reputable institution it
[18:55] doesn't matter when things go bad
[18:59] the most reputable of
[19:01] places do bad things and have to you
[19:05] know have to play along by the rules
[19:08] from the same folks that designed the
[19:10] system to steal from you so reputation
[19:14] doesn't matter at the end of the day
[19:16] they all follow the same rules and in
[19:19] order to avoid being a casualty of
[19:21] war is to assume responsibility over
[19:25] your money and before Bitcoin this was
[19:28] was
[19:29] impossible okay because the Fiat system
[19:31] is owned by you know was owned by
[19:33] government it's owned by the state you
[19:35] don't own anything so unless you're part
[19:37] of their
[19:39] Club you're you know just a pawn in the
[19:43] system and you have to follow the rules
[19:45] that are obviously designed against you
[19:47] you know like whoever beats the casino
[19:48] nobody beats the casino it's the same
[19:51] concept where where do you see um Mass
[19:55] adoption for uh taking being self
[19:59] custody uh in in the future like now we
[20:02] are a small space still we are really
[20:05] early on into Bitcoin
[20:08] and even those people that are in
[20:11] Bitcoin not everybody does self- custody
[20:13] and all the Privacy tools uh we have in
[20:17] our hands right now how do you see a
[20:20] Bitcoin adoption when we are let's see
[20:23] at 20 30 50% of people having Bitcoin
[20:28] how can we have them to understand that
[20:32] if you leave your Bitcoin on an
[20:34] centralized exchange it's basically like
[20:38] having gold at the bank or having your
[20:40] money in the bank it does not belong to
[20:43] like where do you see the mass adoption
[20:46] going do we have one day every every
[20:50] person has their own keys and manage
[20:52] their own keys and self custody is a
[20:54] normal thing like having your own uh
[20:56] Twitter account or is it still something
[20:59] only a small group of people will do
[21:01] even in 20 30 years where do you see the
[21:04] learning curves for the mass going in
[21:06] that
[21:07] direction yeah I mean at some point
[21:09] having self- custody is definitely going
[21:11] to be the norm in my opinion I don't see
[21:13] it happening any other way now how do we
[21:16] get you know from where we are now to
[21:18] that point in time my view is a little
[21:21] bit harsh on this because I genuinely
[21:23] believe that most people are going to
[21:25] get completely destroyed before they
[21:27] actually learn that they uh they need to
[21:30] change their habits that they need to
[21:31] unlearn you know the lies that you know
[21:34] they've been told and relearn you know
[21:37] the proper ways until someone's directly
[21:40] hit until they feel the burn they feel
[21:42] the pain most folks you know will just
[21:45] go along living their comfortable lives
[21:49] unfortunately that that Comfort is
[21:51] coming to an end regardless of where you
[21:53] live I mean if it's not immediately
[21:55] apparent in what's going on globally
[21:57] whether with whether with you know
[22:00] illegal mandates or having your freedoms
[22:03] and and uh more restrictions on anything
[22:06] you do whether your bank is coercing you
[22:08] whether your bank is asking you for 100
[22:10] questions locking up your your accounts
[22:12] forbidding you from sending money from
[22:14] point A to point B without asking you a
[22:16] thousand questions all of these things
[22:18] are going to get you know gradually
[22:20] worse and worse and worse because the
[22:22] system is falling apart they realize
[22:25] that there's more folks exiting the
[22:27] system and they're desperately trying to
[22:30] close um all the ways that you know
[22:34] folks can do this in order to somehow
[22:37] remain relevant I think these efforts
[22:39] will go nowhere but in the meantime they
[22:42] will make your life a living hell if
[22:44] you're not um if you're not careful and
[22:47] so the time to get out of the system is
[22:51] running out um and if you're going to do
[22:54] it you better off doing it now before
[22:58] you get completely wrecked with what's
[22:59] coming I don't believe there's any City
[23:01] or any country that's safe from the
[23:04] collapse of Fiat currencies some folks
[23:06] argue that this stuff only happens to
[23:08] these other places that's an arrogant
[23:10] and a very delusional and a very
[23:12] dangerous mindset to hide to hide behind
[23:15] people with a lot of money Rich folks
[23:18] need Bitcoin more than anything else
[23:20] because it is the only way they're going
[23:22] to preserve their wealth if you think
[23:24] you have a hundred billion dollar and
[23:26] like you're you're living like a king
[23:27] and you're on TCH able when when you
[23:29] know when that dollar becomes worth
[23:30] nothing well then you're worth nothing
[23:32] along with it so what do you do where
[23:34] you going to save it you're going to
[23:35] save it in Gold we're going to save it
[23:37] in real estate where you going to save
[23:38] it these traditionally um safe havens
[23:41] that people thought you know were like
[23:43] the best place to to put their money are
[23:45] nothing of the sort gold is heavily
[23:47] manipulated and if you know if everybody
[23:50] decides to go on to Gold they'll dig up
[23:51] the entire planet and then the supply of
[23:53] gold all of a sudden goes from where it
[23:54] is now some exponentially higher level
[23:57] you know real real estate do you really
[23:59] own your property if you're paying taxes
[24:00] on it every year you know or paying all
[24:03] sorts of like uh not nonsense license or
[24:07] things that are invented you know every
[24:09] every here and then you know for you to
[24:10] pay is it actually your property it's
[24:12] not your property so unless you have an
[24:15] army to protect it and by that when I
[24:17] say protection I mean use violence if
[24:20] necessary because you know fundamentally
[24:22] that's the only way people have been
[24:23] able to protect their their assets you
[24:26] know over the history of time is through
[24:28] violence you're not going to you're not
[24:30] going to um talk your way out of a
[24:33] gunfight so that's one thing so Bitcoin
[24:37] is the only asset that we've ever known
[24:39] in the history of humanity that you can
[24:42] literally memorize 12 or 24 words in
[24:44] your head make it anywhere you want
[24:46] nobody nobody can take it away from you
[24:48] nobody can censor you nobody can
[24:50] sanction you nobody can weaponize the
[24:51] money against you nobody can take it
[24:53] away from you it is 100% yours and
[24:56] there's more folks around around the
[24:58] globe that have been traditionally
[24:59] locked out of the banking system that
[25:01] have been living under the worst
[25:03] conditions financially for decades all
[25:06] of a sudden now they have a bank account
[25:08] no not a bank account they have savings
[25:10] they have money they can transact they
[25:12] don't need somebody's permission to uh
[25:14] to you know send money from point A to
[25:16] point B they are doing it on their own
[25:19] and nothing is going to get these folks
[25:21] to adopt anything else but Freedom money
[25:25] Bitcoin and so when this pain
[25:28] arrives to more places around the globe
[25:32] and comfortable people all of a sudden
[25:34] become
[25:36] uncomfortable that's when you see you
[25:39] know the the the the chaos break out and
[25:42] you know the uh the acceleration to find
[25:45] a solution and the only solution that
[25:48] will you know eventually make sense is
[25:52] Bitcoin because it will be finally
[25:54] understood that once you own it it is
[25:57] yours
[25:58] unless you screw up and be be lazy with
[26:01] your self- custody and don't take the
[26:03] proper measures to protect your
[26:05] generational wealth no one else is going
[26:08] to take it from
[26:10] you so when we have now a world where
[26:14] everybody is self- custody is on self-
[26:17] custody everybody everybody has Bitcoin
[26:19] Bitcoin is the um the main major Apex
[26:24] asset everybody is on and we also
[26:27] thinking about Bitcoin in a unit unit of
[26:29] account like it's completely in the
[26:32] world fixed feat is not there anymore
[26:35] will at this point Bitcoin have broken
[26:39] the state Monopoly is that something on
[26:42] the state Monopoly on
[26:44] violence yes absolutely I mean uh on a
[26:48] on a Bitcoin standard where you cannot
[26:50] infinitely print the money uh violence
[26:53] ends almost instantly how are you going
[26:54] to pay for
[26:56] Wars there's only only 21 million finite
[26:59] supply of Bitcoin I I'm assuming like
[27:01] maybe like five million of them are are
[27:03] lost already nobody knows where they are
[27:05] so technically we're dealing with what
[27:08] six 16 17 million most of them are
[27:11] privately owned by folks that want
[27:12] nothing to do with the Fiat system or
[27:15] violence or Wars or any of that
[27:17] corruption they're not giving up their
[27:19] coins for
[27:21] anyone so if you want to fund something
[27:24] as as a war on a Bitcoin
[27:25] standard you can't
[27:28] Unless somehow you convince folks to
[27:30] give you their their coins yeah good
[27:32] luck with that so Bitcoin forces
[27:35] Humanity to become better okay because
[27:39] the the only way you're going to be able
[27:40] to earn Bitcoin is to
[27:44] provide good value high value into the
[27:47] world so it's going to force every one
[27:49] of us to level up their skill set in
[27:53] order to survive I mean if I'm going to
[27:55] provide a service that service needs to
[27:57] be of value to someone so that you know
[28:00] they're willing to pay me for it and you
[28:04] know the the accepted payments at that
[28:05] point in time will be in Satoshi I mean
[28:08] the days of talking about Bitcoin like
[28:09] we talk about it today um I think will
[28:12] be gone because you know uh no one will
[28:15] be able to own a whole coin in the very
[28:17] very near future the the world will
[28:19] standardize on like satosi will become
[28:22] you know the the terminology used um not
[28:25] Bitcoin have finding a a whole coiner oh
[28:27] my God it's going to be like you know uh
[28:29] finding you know like a like a unicorn
[28:32] so um Bitcoin forces the world to
[28:36] progress in a very very positive way you
[28:39] know that's why they sent some folks
[28:40] call it Renaissance 2.0 and I believe
[28:42] this because everything everything will
[28:45] improve uh prices will go down um people
[28:49] will have better lives your quality of
[28:51] life will go up and you don't have to
[28:53] worry about uh about coercion in the
[28:57] financial sense you don't have to worry
[28:59] about being having your funds blocked or
[29:02] seized because somebody doesn't like
[29:04] your opinion you know like all of that
[29:06] nonsense gets completely terminated and
[29:10] that's how it should
[29:12] be do you have a time frame for that
[29:15] like I think it's a really hard thing to
[29:17] do but but is it like do you see fear
[29:21] dying in the next 10 years in the next
[29:24] 100 years um last guest and know that uh
[29:28] he will he does not see Fiat surviving
[29:31] the next 30 Years um what is your
[29:34] thoughts on that listen I wish I had a
[29:37] crystal ball if it was up to me I'd end
[29:39] it 10 years ago you know but uh that's
[29:42] that that that's not that's not how how
[29:44] it works unfortunately um I think fiat's
[29:47] going to be around for a while um but I
[29:50] think the acceleration out of Fiat is
[29:54] going to happen um and fortunately we
[29:57] don't need 100% Bitcoin adoption for
[30:00] Fiat to fall apart um you need way way
[30:03] less than that you know I mean I'd say I
[30:06] don't know maybe like 10% Bitcoin
[30:07] adoption and you already start seeing
[30:10] like a massive shift in in human
[30:13] behavior um and the way you know folks
[30:16] start interacting with each other you
[30:17] know when they realize that you know the
[30:19] money that you have in the bank account
[30:20] now is worthless when it costs you like
[30:22] $150 to buy a chicken breast you know
[30:25] well you know why would you why would
[30:27] you
[30:28] you know why would you provide your
[30:29] services your time and value for that
[30:31] worthless toilet paper you know you'd
[30:33] want something else right something that
[30:36] actually keeps its value and
[30:38] appreciates over time and this is where
[30:42] um those that you know don't understand
[30:45] this now are going to follow those that
[30:48] are leading by example so everyone
[30:50] that's in Bitcoin especially those that
[30:52] are already living on a Bitcoin standard
[30:54] because they're somehow they've somehow
[30:56] managed to create you know very nice
[30:59] Circ circular economies for themselves
[31:01] where they're completely self-sufficient
[31:02] amongst themselves on a Bitcoin standard
[31:05] you know that's going to start to become
[31:07] more and more uh prevalent you're going
[31:09] to start seeing it in more places and
[31:11] you know folks that are not on it are
[31:13] going to start paying attention because
[31:14] all of a sudden you know these guys are
[31:16] still living well while your life on a
[31:19] Fiat standard is you know continuously
[31:21] getting worse and so at some point even
[31:24] the most stubborn human being is going
[31:27] to say enough is enough and you know ask
[31:31] how do I get out of this threat some
[31:33] folks may not some folks are happy
[31:34] living you know like uh you know under
[31:38] somebody else's foot that's fine but as
[31:40] long as it's their option but I suspect
[31:42] that a lot more individuals will not
[31:45] want to live like government donkeys
[31:47] they're going to want they value their
[31:49] freedom and they're going to want to
[31:51] live the way they see fit not the way
[31:54] somebody else decides that they should
[31:56] live their life
[31:57] I think that's a really really great
[32:00] Point uh to to the end the to go to the
[32:03] end of the the podcast I loved what you
[32:06] said here um I so F like to one to the
[32:10] other point I L especially the the part
[32:14] where um we have to provide value to get
[32:18] anything in return right now in the feat
[32:20] world it's possible to have rent Seekers
[32:23] like it's possible to when you have a
[32:25] lot of wealth you get welfare or what
[32:27] time but with a proof of work system you
[32:29] have to provide value for others to get
[32:32] anything done like that's also the the
[32:35] um difference between any altcoins that
[32:37] are on a proof of stake model uh the
[32:40] more you stake the more wealthy you are
[32:42] the more you get in return that's that's
[32:44] a broken system in itself I think and
[32:47] the proof of work system is just so so
[32:49] so so great because if you offer a lot
[32:52] of value you will get a lot of Bitcoin
[32:53] in return but if you stop offering value
[32:57] you will not get any Bitcoin more and
[33:00] the only thing getting more is the the
[33:02] value of your Bitcoin but in the Bitcoin
[33:05] world it's more like everything gets
[33:07] cheaper but your Bitcoin stack will not
[33:09] increase if you don't offer value to the
[33:12] society this uh this um part they love
[33:16] the most about
[33:17] Bitcoin yeah absolutely and I mean at at
[33:20] some point in very very near future um
[33:23] in my opinion you won't be we won't be
[33:24] able to buy Bitcoin anymore I mean uh
[33:27] once this the ETFs get approved okay I
[33:31] suspect all that big money is going to
[33:34] want it siphon everything that's
[33:36] currently available to them right and
[33:38] once that happens you know that's when
[33:40] you go to bed one night and the price is
[33:43] I don't know 37,000 and you wake up the
[33:45] next day and you you give yourself a
[33:46] heart attack because you're like what
[33:49] happened what happened overnight and
[33:52] essentially you know when the supply on
[33:53] the market is gone cuz somebody else
[33:55] owns it now this this is what happens
[33:57] you know when you have a there's no
[33:59] limited a demand shock on bitcoin but
[34:03] nothing anyone can do is going to change
[34:05] the supply and that's the key so there
[34:09] can be 8 billion people demanding
[34:12] Bitcoin the supply remains at wherever
[34:15] it's at 21 million minus whatever's been
[34:17] lost forever no matter who likes it or
[34:21] not it's that
[34:24] simple maybe one last question what do
[34:27] you think about the spot ETF that's
[34:29] possibly granted in the next one to six
[34:33] months what I he about in America what
[34:36] your thoughts about what happens when it
[34:38] once it gets approved when will it get
[34:41] approved what what your thoughts on this
[34:44] whole topic well the the Bitcoin ETF is
[34:47] definitely a bullish news for Bitcoin in
[34:50] the sense that it's going to finally
[34:51] give the courage to a lot of folks to uh
[34:55] to consider it not because the ETF
[34:58] itself is such a good product it's not
[35:00] it's it's payer Bitcoin you don't you
[35:02] don't own any Bitcoin if you buy a
[35:04] Bitcoin ETF but a lot of folks that
[35:07] don't want to have anything to do with
[35:08] Bitcoin for whatever absurd reason
[35:11] currently um all of a sudden now they're
[35:13] like oh wow okay so now Black Rock says
[35:15] it's it's okay so then you know let's
[35:17] look into it so it brings the it brings
[35:21] like a a Monumental shift of attention
[35:25] you know from folks that have lot of
[35:27] money but I've never considered it
[35:29] before now now they'll start paying
[35:30] serious attention to it and hopefully
[35:33] you know with with time they will you
[35:36] know invest that the uh the energy to
[35:39] actually learn what it is and uh opt out
[35:42] of the ETF and perhaps into self-
[35:45] custody and that'll continue to you know
[35:47] to increase over time when the big
[35:49] institutions come in like you know why
[35:51] why they're all fighting for it now it's
[35:53] because they realize that globally
[35:56] there's probably less than two million
[35:57] Bitcoin on all exchanges today the value
[36:00] of all that Bitcoin if you look at
[36:02] today's price is maybe like my math is
[36:05] on maybe like I don't know 775 billion
[36:07] doll all right for an asset manager of
[36:10] 10 trillion what do you think 75 billion
[36:12] is it's it's like 75 cents in your
[36:15] pocket it's nothing so they could
[36:18] literally swipe it all out in one go
[36:20] whether it's one of them whether it's
[36:22] all of them essentially it'll be gone
[36:24] because it's peanuts for someone with
[36:27] that much
[36:28] capital and that's when you know the
[36:31] price goes parabolic and that's when
[36:33] everybody else you know the general
[36:35] public you know wake up one day they
[36:37] read the headlines that Bitcoin is half
[36:39] a million or one million or some
[36:40] ridiculous number like this now all of a
[36:42] sudden they all want it but by then you
[36:46] know the most folks are completely
[36:48] priced out of it and they will not be
[36:51] able to get anywhere near what they can
[36:54] today or for the last 15 years had they
[36:57] been paying proper attention and not
[36:59] laughing it off as some some silly scam
[37:02] this is what I think it's going to
[37:03] happen it's definitely good news it's
[37:05] definitely bullish news to create as you
[37:07] know much more attention and awareness
[37:10] um towards the asset the product itself
[37:14] I would never buy you know you're not
[37:15] buying real Bitcoin on buying Bitcoin P
[37:18] ETF any profits you make are in Fiat so
[37:21] um but again you know everybody needs to
[37:23] start somewhere and as they say you know
[37:25] you you get Bitcoin at the price you
[37:27] deserve so if you wait too long until it
[37:29] becomes super super safe and you're
[37:31] super super comfortable that all your
[37:32] neighbors talk about it well then you're
[37:35] going to pay a very very expensive price
[37:37] you know for that comfort and safety
[37:40] whereas if you do the homework now do
[37:42] the work do the research spend some time
[37:44] learning listening asking questions and
[37:46] digging a little deeper you know you
[37:49] will get in on an opportunity that
[37:52] Humanity has never ever seen before and
[37:55] will likely never ever see again that's
[37:58] my opinion on bitcoin it's it will it's
[38:01] bigger than electricity and the internet
[38:04] combined exponentially that's the way I
[38:07] see it that's a great uh last line I
[38:10] love it um I have an end routine at the
[38:14] the podcast where the previous guests
[38:17] ask a question for the next guest
[38:20] without knowing who's the next guest and
[38:22] the previous guest uh asked uh you
[38:27] um what core principle is most important
[38:31] to you in your
[38:32] life
[38:34] dignity dignity and and and
[38:38] freedom um no one should live a life um
[38:41] dictated by someone else no one should
[38:44] do it if you have any sense of self-
[38:46] value and and and dignity this is
[38:49] something you
[38:51] will insanely defend and not and like
[38:55] and resist any attempt to take it away
[38:57] from you no matter what you know there's
[38:59] a famous saying that goes along the
[39:02] lines of you cannot call yourself
[39:04] peaceful if you're not capable of
[39:07] violence if you're not capable of
[39:10] violence you're not peaceful you're
[39:13] harmless you're useless that's so great
[39:15] yeah if you if you're not capable of
[39:17] violence you don't know if you're
[39:19] peacefulness that's great because
[39:22] because you're
[39:23] harmless you cannot call yourself
[39:25] peaceful if you're not willing to
[39:27] defend your freedom using violence you
[39:31] know the most the most peaceful times in
[39:34] the world have usually come after Wars
[39:37] when people you know unfortunately had
[39:39] to die to protect these uh these values
[39:42] and these principles I mean the fact
[39:44] that you know we've been living free for
[39:45] so long this doesn't just Land from the
[39:48] sky you know many individuals sacrificed
[39:51] their lives for this and it's important
[39:55] to keep that in mind because history
[39:57] seems to be repeating itself now and uh
[40:01] you know we're put in a position now
