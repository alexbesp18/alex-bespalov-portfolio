[00:00] you know we're kind of bringing tether
[00:01] right now to to bitcoin like that's a
[00:03] big narrative that that tether is now
[00:04] going to come on Lightning Network and
[00:05] I'm just kind of like all right hooray
[00:07] cool like but that's not what I'm in
[00:08] this revolution for you know as much as
[00:10] we want to perpetuate this Bitcoin
[00:11] Revolution that that people really
[00:13] tremendously value stable coins like to
[00:15] the point where it doesn't matter how
[00:16] much we kind of preach about like
[00:17] Bitcoin is freedom technology and it
[00:19] store a value like these people they
[00:21] don't have any value to store and so
[00:23] this is the way of the bitcoin's
[00:24] community saying okay if if we can't get
[00:26] them on board with Bitcoin the asset yet
[00:28] let's at least give them stable coins
[00:30] but have those stable coins live on
[00:32] bitcoin rails and indirectly that could
[00:34] benefit Bitcoin if there were changes
[00:37] that could come in maybe people talk
[00:38] about things like covenants it would be
[00:40] very very beneficial and it would make
[00:42] some of this stuff a bit cleaner uh
[00:44] arguably more secure more efficient but
[00:46] fundamentally it's not required and I
[00:48] think that's what's kind of contributed
[00:50] to this Overton window shifting and and
[00:52] this new excitement where people say if
[00:54] we do never get any sort of change
[00:55] whatsoever in in Bitcoin some of this
[00:57] stuff is actually possible
[01:00] [Music]
[01:03] for the people that maybe don't know you
[01:05] um maybe give us a short overview of
[01:08] like what are you doing uh and and and
[01:10] who are
[01:11] you uh sure so yeah my name is David C I
[01:15] work at a company called Alin Labs uh
[01:17] we're building uh something called ZK
[01:18] rollups on top of Bitcoin and this is an
[01:20] alternative Layer Two scaling solution
[01:23] uh to kind of bring expressivity and
[01:25] scaling to uh to bitcoin uh you know I I
[01:28] come from a little bit of a like
[01:30] armchair libertarian type background so
[01:32] when I got into Bitcoin I was very much
[01:34] predisposed to a lot of the ideological
[01:36] side of you know separation of money and
[01:38] state and um kind of more like Austrian
[01:41] monetary maximalist type ideas but then
[01:44] over the years I kind of was peering
[01:45] over the fence into some of these other
[01:46] ecosystems and saying H like can we
[01:49] bring some of this technology and some
[01:50] of this Innovation to bitcoin uh and for
[01:52] a while it was a resounding no um but
[01:54] now there seems to be a little bit of
[01:56] change in the air uh there seems to be
[01:58] opportunity us for us to bring things to
[02:00] bitcoin that we never imagined were
[02:02] possible and uh that's kind of what I've
[02:03] dedicated uh next part of my life to
[02:06] what uh for for people that know no also
[02:10] it was also something new for for me
[02:11] what what are CK
[02:13] roles yeah yeah so um I guess I can
[02:17] start like you know very early on in in
[02:20] Bitcoin um like people understood that
[02:22] hey there's going to be some scaling
[02:23] limitations here like you you maybe like
[02:26] can only do a certain number of
[02:27] transactions per second or you know you
[02:29] can't add certain functionality to
[02:31] bitcoin and people kind of explore these
[02:33] ideas uh one of the earliest things was
[02:35] a concept called side chains and side
[02:37] chains are like separate blockchains
[02:39] from Bitcoin but then you can take your
[02:41] BTC the asset and you can Bridge it into
[02:44] these side chains that maybe have
[02:45] different functionality they have you
[02:47] know maybe they can add privacy maybe
[02:49] they can do faster transactions maybe
[02:51] they just have any sort of f
[02:53] functionality you have and for a while
[02:55] in in Bitcoin people thought that this
[02:56] was kind of like the hero's solution to
[02:58] everything uh but there was a
[03:00] fundamental problem which is that you
[03:01] were trusting somebody to get into these
[03:04] other side chain ecosystems you're
[03:06] giving up custody of your Bitcoin in
[03:08] order to receive a a derivative token in
[03:11] this other side chain ecosystem and so
[03:13] that idea kind of uh lost a lot of of
[03:16] interest because it was antithetical to
[03:18] what we care about in Bitcoin which is
[03:20] you know sovereignty and freedom and and
[03:21] not relying on on centralized parties um
[03:24] but long story short in some other
[03:25] ecosystems like ethereum which I know is
[03:27] like a taboo topic to to discuss they
[03:30] they they really did have these kind of
[03:31] like um you know breakthrough ideas that
[03:34] said hey we can take this concept of a
[03:35] side chain and then we can remove the
[03:38] centralized party using some fancy
[03:40] cryptography and we can have that Vision
[03:42] that we wanted which is don't change
[03:43] Bitcoin don't freck with with with with
[03:46] Bitcoin but allow other people to opt
[03:48] into these other functionality uh in in
[03:51] these other features and so a lot of
[03:53] those ideas of this concept ZK rollups
[03:56] took that original idea of side chains
[03:58] improved it with some fancy cryptography
[04:01] and now people are saying hey we can
[04:02] bring this back to bitcoin that's a
[04:05] little bit of a summ of the
[04:07] history it's it's also interesting I
[04:10] mean there are two two really
[04:11] interesting things in there uh the first
[04:13] is like um I I in the beginning like one
[04:18] year ago I was really toxic Maxi of like
[04:20] like uh hat hating on all of the
[04:23] altcoins now I'm more practical in a
[04:26] sense of like I don't dable with them
[04:31] but they have uh some some value in them
[04:34] because people are kind of experimenting
[04:37] with them and because they're
[04:39] experimenting with it they might bring
[04:42] something valuable to bitcoin as like a
[04:43] test net and and as I understood it you
[04:47] got that idea of those CK rollups uh
[04:50] kind of from ethereum and and like smart
[04:53] contracts and and and and many other
[04:56] smaller things uh maybe come from the AL
[04:59] coin
[05:00] uh world into Bitcoin and I think that's
[05:02] that's not a bad thing overall I don't
[05:05] see a value in having something kind of
[05:08] decentralized like for me that's altcoin
[05:10] it's like it's not a centralized
[05:12] database but it's also not really
[05:13] decentralized like I don't get the point
[05:15] of of altcoins using them but I do see a
[05:18] value in learning from them what we
[05:21] could maybe put uh onto Bitcoin that's
[05:25] that's a there are some value into that
[05:26] I feel like yeah and to be clear like
[05:29] this isn't about all kinds like I
[05:30] definitely am sympathetic and kind of
[05:32] come from that that camp where Bitcoin
[05:34] is the revolution like I think there's
[05:36] pretty clear evidence that a lot of
[05:37] these other tokens are are are pretty
[05:39] worthless and like they're just Rife
[05:40] with with grift and just like Solutions
[05:45] looking for problems and at the end of
[05:46] the day like the only clear revolution
[05:49] in product Market fit is you know
[05:51] Bitcoin as as as money so it's it's not
[05:53] about trying to bring you know alt
[05:55] altcoins over to to to bitcoin it's
[05:57] about trying to expand the the the
[06:00] functionality of Bitcoin itself and
[06:02] trying to expand this revolution of of
[06:04] separation of money and state and while
[06:07] as a byproduct of some of this stuff
[06:09] that's coming like people unfortunately
[06:11] Like For Better or Worse will be able to
[06:12] deploy tokens along with that we get
[06:15] amazing features and functionality for
[06:16] Bitcoin we get things like you know you
[06:18] could take this cell phone here which
[06:19] has a hardware wallet in it it basically
[06:21] has like a ledger or a treasure in it
[06:23] but it's it it it can't be accessed
[06:25] right now and and when you add this kind
[06:27] of like trustless expressivity to
[06:28] bitcoin now everyone in the world that
[06:30] has a cell phone they can start
[06:31] essentially keeping like a hardware
[06:33] wallet on here they can start making
[06:34] payments using you know face ID
[06:36] trustless with no centralized
[06:37] intermediaries like we can have things
[06:39] like Bitcoin back stable coins you can
[06:41] have you know the ability to borrow
[06:43] against your Bitcoin at extremely low
[06:44] interest rates you can you you can have
[06:46] things like the you know being able to
[06:48] buy Bitcoin without coinbase or without
[06:51] binance like there's there's really some
[06:53] some some beautiful functionality that
[06:55] in this sea of kind of chaos that was
[06:57] these other ecosystems there's small
[06:58] little bits of innov
[07:00] and for me I think the Overton window is
[07:02] Shifting and people are saying like
[07:04] maybe some of this Stu is actually kind
[07:05] of cool and it can further our
[07:08] Revolution which is Bitcoin not anybody
[07:10] else's Revolution but make the Bitcoin
[07:11] Revolution better rather than trying to
[07:13] other people trying to come in and and
[07:16] Co-op to
[07:17] bitcoin what do you mean with like the
[07:20] Overton over Overton window is is
[07:22] Shifting I think um you know the past
[07:25] few years there really was that kind of
[07:27] like toxic Maxi uh movement which it's
[07:29] like everything was a scam everything is
[07:31] a shitcoin like Bitcoin is the core
[07:33] Revolution like we need nothing else and
[07:35] while there is like some some some some
[07:37] core truth to that I think people like
[07:40] are are are kind of shifting from that
[07:41] perspective even even the most
[07:43] maximalist uh of people and are they're
[07:44] kind of like the overtime window is
[07:46] Shifting the sense that people are being
[07:47] like hm like maybe we leaned just a
[07:50] little bit too hard in that extreme and
[07:52] like maybe we do want you know things
[07:54] like non-custodial
[07:56] uh uh you know Solutions and and maybe
[07:59] we do want to add like some form of
[08:00] expressivity to bitcoin and I think um a
[08:03] lot of people in Bitcoin including some
[08:05] of my close friends who who who are
[08:07] pretty hardcore are at least now
[08:09] entertaining some of this stuff more so
[08:11] than they would um before and I even
[08:13] think that you're seeing this in like
[08:14] the deepest levels of of kind of like
[08:17] respected Bitcoin developers like
[08:19] Bitcoin core Engineers who who are kind
[08:21] of um like actively researching like
[08:24] this concept that I mentioned like of of
[08:26] ZK of zero knowledge of this like
[08:28] advanced kind of bleeding edge
[08:30] cryptography and saying hey like this
[08:32] stuff could actually fit in in into
[08:34] Bitcoin so that's what I mean by the
[08:36] Overton window is Shifting where um you
[08:40] you would kind of mention like in the
[08:42] context of altcoins that you know we're
[08:44] going to take the good ideas from
[08:45] altcoins and bring them to bitcoin that
[08:47] that was like in the early days of
[08:48] Bitcoin that was a very very common
[08:50] thing that we we would say and something
[08:52] that we believe and I think we lost side
[08:53] of that for a little while that hey
[08:56] Bitcoin is the gravity well like Bitcoin
[08:58] is the magnet all this stuff is going to
[09:00] come back to bitcoin and and we kind of
[09:02] shunned it for years and said no no no
[09:03] no like we don't want anything to come
[09:05] back to bitcoin like we just want to
[09:06] reject it all and now that over window
[09:08] is Shifting and people are saying okay a
[09:10] lot of it we don't want on bitcoin but
[09:11] like some of it we actually do and like
[09:13] let's bring that gravitational well back
[09:15] to
[09:16] bitcoin is there anything that that is
[09:20] is required uh changes on the base layer
[09:24] or is it just like how we build on top
[09:26] of a already kind of finished Bas layer
[09:29] product
[09:30] there's no changes that are required to
[09:32] bitcoin layer one whatsoever um to be
[09:35] clear like if there were changes that
[09:37] could come in maybe people talk about
[09:39] things like covenants it would be very
[09:41] very beneficial and it would make some
[09:43] of this stuff a bit cleaner arguably
[09:45] more secure more efficient but
[09:47] fundamentally it's not required and I
[09:49] think that's what's kind of contributed
[09:51] to this Overton window shifting and in
[09:53] this new excitement where people say huh
[09:56] okay like if we do never get any sort of
[09:59] change whatsoever in in Bitcoin some of
[10:02] this stuff is actually possible um
[10:04] that's that's at the root of of this
[10:06] kind of change interesting I mean if if
[10:09] if like if there's no change uh at the
[10:12] base layer required for an innovation
[10:14] happening on top of Bitcoin I feel like
[10:18] nobody has like nobody can be uh pissed
[10:23] off by that because then it's just using
[10:26] the Bitcoin as it's already is if
[10:29] there's now a debate happening or like
[10:31] should we like 2017 is an extreme
[10:33] example of course now with the block
[10:35] size Wars but that's like an
[10:37] understanding and maybe it also comes a
[10:38] little bit from that of like this
[10:40] because it was such a heart attack
[10:42] within Bitcoin that that uh the Bitcoin
[10:45] has got really productive um and uh it's
[10:48] hard for me to relate to that because I
[10:50] was just not in in 2017 there and but I
[10:53] can imagine being active in
[10:56] 2017 uh and and living through an
[10:59] industry all of the oh I almost tossed
[11:02] my light now down uh but being an
[11:05] industry all of the sudden there's
[11:06] someone that attacks the core of Bitcoin
[11:09] the security
[11:10] decentralization uh it it it it then
[11:13] makes it feel like oh like maybe that's
[11:14] happening now with like whatever goes on
[11:17] but if it doesn't touch the main layer
[11:19] like Bitcoin will handle whatever is top
[11:21] on top of it and the free market will
[11:24] show if it has value or not like it's a
[11:26] it's a free market play for me yeah I I
[11:29] think you had the nail on the head and
[11:30] uh I think Jameson Lop I'm paraphrasing
[11:33] here but he kind of mentioned that in in
[11:35] Bitcoin whatever the current default
[11:37] position is is the winning position or
[11:40] the one with the leverage and by that I
[11:42] mean that that if the default is you
[11:45] can't build anything on bitcoin then
[11:49] that is the camp that that is
[11:50] essentially in power but now that you
[11:53] can essentially build some of the stuff
[11:54] on bitcoin because people kind of had
[11:56] these these these kind of creative ways
[11:59] to to now start building that's kind of
[12:00] reigniting this season too like now it's
[12:03] it's the builders that are in control
[12:04] like in the past few years it was the
[12:06] oif firers and kind of like the hardcore
[12:08] maximalist that were that were in
[12:10] control and because the if we ever had
[12:12] this conversation where I was making
[12:13] some sort of pitch and saying hey this
[12:14] is a really cool feature we'd love to
[12:16] add this to to to bitcoin they could
[12:18] just say okay go ahead and Fork it Fork
[12:21] Fork Bitcoin good luck trying to change
[12:23] change it yourself but now that we can
[12:25] actually build this stuff and the
[12:27] default position is hey no changes to
[12:29] Bitcoin whatsoever are required now the
[12:31] kind of like winning position so to
[12:33] speak are the people that that are going
[12:34] to be building and anybody that kind of
[12:37] wants to aify or prevent this this stuff
[12:39] from coming to bitcoin you know now the
[12:41] builders are saying well you guys Fork
[12:42] it you guys Fork off and and you remove
[12:45] some of this stuff like like tap rot
[12:47] that that enabled some of this this this
[12:49] new functionality and
[12:51] so yeah it's it's a very interesting
[12:54] power Dynamic that that that that's
[12:55] starting to to play out here in in
[12:58] Bitcoin that we don't we don't need the
[13:00] soft Fork to to to build any of this
[13:02] stuff yeah like you can build everything
[13:05] directly on top of bitco um people also
[13:08] like that there's this um I think what
[13:12] was it one and a half years ago uh two
[13:15] years ago where this big debate on like
[13:17] spam on on top of Bitcoin was I think
[13:20] like that time frame and and I was
[13:22] always I didn't had the podcast back
[13:25] then but I was always very hard on like
[13:28] uh if they spam the Bitcoin transactions
[13:31] they're paying for the security of
[13:33] Bitcoin that's overall a good thing like
[13:35] they're investing basically in in
[13:37] Bitcoin if and and I never thought
[13:39] that's uh sustainable and we now see
[13:42] like we have like very low like you you
[13:44] can probably make like a transaction for
[13:46] like 50 cents now on the Bitcoin base
[13:48] layer uh back then we we had some times
[13:51] where we had $500 you had to pay for
[13:54] transactions uh so it was not
[13:56] sustainable at all uh but but showed
[13:59] kind of like yeah like you can do it on
[14:01] bitcoin you can sub you can inscribe one
[14:04] Satoshi and and pay a thousand EUR for
[14:06] that go ahead like it is good for
[14:09] overall Bitcoin security every attack as
[14:13] as as may as May it's a small attack big
[14:16] attack whatever attack it it might be
[14:18] even even if it's not even an attack
[14:20] even if it's just building on top of
[14:21] Bitcoin this all makes kind of uh
[14:24] Bitcoin stronger and it kind of ties
[14:26] into the the thing back like everything
[14:28] is good for Bitcoin even though I'm not
[14:30] a fan of that saying but like most of
[14:32] the stuff is actually good for Bitcoin
[14:34] and and not not bad at all yeah I think
[14:37] you touched on a couple interesting
[14:39] points there like like even if you know
[14:42] we kind of said all this stuff that that
[14:44] that potentially could be done with
[14:45] Bitcoin with ordinals and and everything
[14:48] uh and just so people are clear like
[14:49] that's that's not what we're building
[14:50] you know like uh you know us at up and
[14:52] like we're we're kind of building more
[14:54] of you know Financial applications non-
[14:56] custo Solutions like very like money
[14:57] oriented stuff but but even if you're
[15:00] kind of like anti you know ordinal and
[15:02] jpegs on the chain it's kind of been
[15:05] shown that you you literally can't like
[15:08] add filters credibly and like fully
[15:10] prevent people from Ever just posting
[15:12] arbitrary data on on bitcoin so as much
[15:16] as people don't like it it it it's kind
[15:18] of like an impossible problem to solve
[15:19] unless you completely gut and strip
[15:21] Bitcoin and and basically like hard Fork
[15:24] it um I also think you brought up
[15:26] another good point that that yes like in
[15:29] long run we do need to start adding you
[15:32] know more fees to the Bitcoin layer one
[15:33] like you know every four years the
[15:36] miners make less money there could be a
[15:39] scenario where eventually they're making
[15:40] so little money that they say mining
[15:42] isn't worth it and it could destabilize
[15:43] the network like we do need to start
[15:45] adding you know ways to to drive
[15:48] transaction fees and in volume to
[15:50] Bitcoin in order to keep it secure and I
[15:53] think what is interesting is now that we
[15:56] can build you know more Express
[15:59] uh like layer twos on top of Bitcoin
[16:02] that settle to to the Bitcoin layer one
[16:05] what you'll start to see is people say
[16:07] hey maybe I want to to use payments on
[16:10] something like a ZK rollup or maybe I
[16:12] want to you know borrow against my my
[16:13] Bitcoin or maybe I want to you know
[16:15] again use that pass keys on my you can
[16:17] have all this functionality and all of
[16:19] that can settle to the Bitcoin layer one
[16:22] which could drive significant fees to to
[16:25] to the layer one and and and and pay
[16:26] these miners so I think it's a huge
[16:28] blessing honestly the the this this now
[16:31] ability to to to start you know building
[16:33] credible layer twos that can settle on
[16:35] bitcoin and drive a lot of fees uh using
[16:38] like monetary
[16:40] applications interesting I want to touch
[16:43] um um later let's let's go now in there
[16:48] um a little bit on serial knowledge
[16:50] rollups on lightning on layer two things
[16:53] because I think um when it comes to
[16:57] bitcoin topics outside of economics and
[16:59] we touched on that before already that
[17:02] sometimes a layer two stuff and like
[17:03] scaling Bitcoin it's like a little bit
[17:05] of a niche um topic of Bitcoin because
[17:09] people are really like they they are
[17:11] using it now store of value like that's
[17:13] the that's the use case that 99% of
[17:16] Bitcoin has used it for and there are
[17:18] some that experiment with other stuff on
[17:20] top of Bitcoin but most people use it as
[17:22] a store of value so what are they
[17:24] usually most interested in like the
[17:26] economics of it the the the G technology
[17:29] the freedom gr technology is like using
[17:31] it as a bank account where you might get
[17:33] unbanked and all those topics so we we
[17:36] we have a lot of Education to do I think
[17:39] when it comes to Layer Two of scaling
[17:40] Bitcoin um so help help us think through
[17:44] of like what is lightning in the
[17:46] ecosystem what are you seeing maybe with
[17:48] like fedman what are you seeing with
[17:50] like CK rollups Zer knowledge rollups
[17:53] what you doing and and how does this all
[17:55] kind of fit
[17:57] together okay okay sure so um I guess we
[18:01] can start with with lightning Network
[18:04] lightning network is a very specific
[18:06] architecture um that is kind of tailor
[18:09] made to do like one specific task which
[18:12] is payments so you can do you know High
[18:15] volumes of of of just purely
[18:17] transferring the asset uh you know back
[18:19] and forth and so you know you and I
[18:21] Robin we can open a channel where we can
[18:23] send very fast Bitcoin between each
[18:25] other and then you can open another
[18:27] Channel with somebody else and then I
[18:28] can access that person through you and
[18:29] you kind of create this topography and
[18:32] in theory Lightning's like very cool for
[18:34] for for for payments um but I think over
[18:37] time people have realized that it pretty
[18:39] much just does payments and the user
[18:42] experience to interact with lightning is
[18:44] ends up being a bit clunky it's not easy
[18:47] it's not like you can open up your your
[18:49] phone kind of like a venmo or a cash app
[18:52] style experience and just like instantly
[18:54] be able to um to send and receive
[18:57] payments in a non-custodial way if you
[18:59] want that experience in lightning a lot
[19:01] of people are seeing that that you kind
[19:02] of have to use some sort of custodian to
[19:03] do it so Lightning's still a fantastic
[19:05] solution but there are limitations
[19:07] around the user experience um and the
[19:10] kind of potential custodial uh n nature
[19:13] of it the other thing that that that you
[19:15] mentioned is something called uh fety
[19:17] mints so fety mints um uses a concept
[19:21] called Federation where you're you're
[19:22] essentially uh relying or trusting on um
[19:27] you know some amount of people whether
[19:28] it's you know 1 three five or whatever
[19:31] and as long as the majority of them are
[19:33] honest then you can operate in this fety
[19:36] and in this fedt you get perfect privacy
[19:38] transactions which is an amazing benefit
[19:40] and it's very scalable uh payments as
[19:42] well and so fedt in Federation generally
[19:45] are are very very flexible you can get
[19:47] the wonderful user experience you can
[19:49] get the functionality of privacy in
[19:51] theory you could even add smart
[19:52] contracts but the fundamental trade-off
[19:54] is like you're you're you're trusting
[19:56] someone there and you know could the
[20:00] owners of the the the Federation which
[20:02] kind of govern the fetyan like could
[20:04] they censor you yes could they you know
[20:07] steal all of your funds yes and so I
[20:10] think it's it's it's a decent option for
[20:12] us to have but it's perhaps a little bit
[20:15] antithetical to this you know not your
[20:17] keys not your coin you know have
[20:19] sovereignty um that that we want in
[20:23] Bitcoin uh ZK rollups um on the other
[20:26] hand are um you know a way for us
[20:30] to have the single best user experience
[20:33] that you could possibly imagine you know
[20:34] something that feels like cash app that
[20:36] feels like venmo um except you're not
[20:38] relyant on a centralized intermediary
[20:41] and it allows you to uh to to have these
[20:43] more expressive smart contracts if
[20:46] there's kind of useful applications in
[20:47] ethereum again without relying on a
[20:50] centralized uh
[20:51] intermediary and the way that a ZK
[20:54] rollup uh works I I'll try to explain it
[20:56] here and you can let me know if it gets
[20:58] a little too technical is with any sort
[21:01] of Bitcoin scaling solution whatsoever
[21:03] conceptually they all work the same way
[21:05] that that Bitcoin the asset it
[21:06] technically can never leave the layer
[21:08] one so what you do is is you know you
[21:10] and I would maybe take our Bitcoin and
[21:12] we would lock it on the layer one in
[21:14] something like a multisig and then that
[21:16] Bitcoin gets represented in the layer
[21:18] two whether that layer two is lightning
[21:21] or fedt or ZK rollup you're always
[21:24] locking BTC on the layer one and then
[21:26] you're essentially issuing a kind of
[21:28] derivative asset uh on this layer two
[21:31] the question is how does Bitcoin layer
[21:34] one know what happened on the layer two
[21:37] if you're operating in lightning Network
[21:38] and you're pay sending all these
[21:40] payments how does how does Bitcoin know
[21:42] what the new updated uh you know
[21:44] balances for everyone are if you send it
[21:45] into aiment how does it know uh you know
[21:48] what happened up there same thing in a
[21:50] ZK rollup well this concept of a zero
[21:53] knowledge proof is the ability to prove
[21:56] the validity of something without
[21:59] a person having to recreate or recompute
[22:01] that work so in this sense in a ZK
[22:03] rollup if you and I Robin do a bunch of
[22:05] transactions and we do smart contracts
[22:07] and whatever and the balances all change
[22:09] this is all happening offchain on the
[22:11] layer two we can compress all of that
[22:13] into this cryptographic thing called a
[22:15] zero knowledge proof almost like a
[22:16] digital thumb print or or a fingerprint
[22:19] and the Bitcoin layer one can read that
[22:21] and say look I don't care if you did
[22:23] fcoin nft defi you know private payments
[22:27] whatever like Bitcoin has no idea about
[22:29] all that all it knows is this final
[22:31] result that Robin now has you know two
[22:34] Bitcoin even though he started off with
[22:36] one and here's a mathematical proof that
[22:39] proves the validity that proves with
[22:41] mathematical certainty that your balance
[22:43] is now one Bitcoin and that allows
[22:46] Bitcoin to kind of like receive this
[22:48] information from the layer two but not
[22:51] force our nodes to actually go and
[22:54] recompute that all all of itself so
[22:55] Bitcoin doesn't our our Bitcoin nodes
[22:57] which we want to keep link and small and
[22:59] the network decentralized they don't
[23:01] have to compute all of this stuff they
[23:03] just have to verify the final result and
[23:06] verifying this is much more scalable and
[23:09] much more easy than Computing it and all
[23:12] of that allows us to add this
[23:14] functionality and scale and everything
[23:15] on that layer twos but still anchor it
[23:18] to bitcoin layer one how do I do that's
[23:23] it I understood it it's it's just for me
[23:26] like um very hard to find the difference
[23:30] between what what what lightning and
[23:32] what secet rollers because both are
[23:35] basically as you said they they're
[23:37] reporting up and and then they do
[23:39] something with like lightning with like
[23:41] opening channels and then like closing
[23:43] it then it it gets uh comes back on the
[23:46] on the main layer and and the same thing
[23:49] is here is also like you you you you're
[23:51] opening up you locking the the the the
[23:54] keys basically in uh you're doing
[23:56] something on top of it um and then at
[23:59] some point you want to lock it back in
[24:01] on the domain layer and then like then
[24:03] uh Bitcoin knows okay like Robin has now
[24:07] uh one Bitcoin more like those Bitcoin
[24:10] got distributed in that way um uh so so
[24:14] maybe let's talk like the
[24:16] differentiation between how how
[24:18] lightning works versus the the Ser
[24:20] knowledge
[24:22] proof well maybe I'll try to go
[24:25] non-technical first lightning um again
[24:29] you really only can do payments and the
[24:32] user experience is is is not great with
[24:36] something like a rollup you can do
[24:39] anything you know you can program the
[24:42] money to to to to function any way you
[24:44] want with any sort of smart contract
[24:45] with any sort of user
[24:47] experience um but it's maybe not as
[24:49] custom built for payment so that's
[24:51] that's just a high level difference
[24:52] there Lightnings payments not great ux
[24:56] uh ZK rollups are any functionality you
[24:59] you can imagine with like the best user
[25:01] experience uh
[25:03] possible um yeah because of that like
[25:05] you you you can't add expressivity in
[25:09] smart contracts to to lightning uh you
[25:11] can only do that with with a rollup so
[25:13] does that answer your question or are
[25:14] you wanting to try to dive in more
[25:17] Deeply One Thing uh maybe one thing that
[25:20] I've never touched on the the podcast
[25:23] itself um if if if you want to like I
[25:26] think it's it's it's great on that point
[25:28] because we mentioned it um uh what are
[25:31] actually smart contracts what are they
[25:33] doing uh and and and and how does this
[25:36] maybe then it gets maybe more easy to
[25:40] understand the the the other stuff the
[25:42] way that I think of a smart contract is
[25:44] almost like an automated uh you know
[25:46] escrow uh company so in in real world uh
[25:49] you know we have escro companies like
[25:51] attorneys like if you're going out and
[25:53] buying a house and you know you're
[25:55] selling your house to me I would send my
[25:57] money
[25:58] into this escrow contract the you would
[26:01] essentially send the deed of your house
[26:03] into this escrow and then an attorney
[26:05] would have the instructions that say
[26:06] okay do this do this do this do this and
[26:09] then transact the the the the
[26:11] transaction so you're trusting a kind of
[26:13] centralized intermediary to follow a set
[26:16] of instructions and they are legally
[26:18] bound to to follow those instructions if
[26:20] the attorney violates uh you know the
[26:23] the instructions of the escrow then they
[26:25] could be liable and they could be sued
[26:27] you could think of a smart contract is a
[26:29] way to to kind of create an automated
[26:31] escrow for money where people can put in
[26:35] you know Bitcoin or some sort of money
[26:37] or other you know tokens or assets and
[26:39] they can program a contract to say
[26:41] follow this rule this rule this rule
[26:43] this this Rule and instead of having
[26:45] like an attorney there that's kind of
[26:46] responsible for following all these
[26:49] rules the smart contract will
[26:51] essentially facilitate all all of those
[26:54] rules without any sort of centralized
[26:56] intermediary so that allows you to to to
[26:59] program money um without having uh you
[27:04] know something like like an attorney I
[27:05] think that's a decent analogy is to to
[27:07] to think of smart contracts as just
[27:10] programmable escrow
[27:12] agreements interesting that there's so
[27:14] much happening with Bitcoin like also
[27:16] like minus scripts and and stuff like
[27:18] that and time locks and all those topics
[27:21] uh which uh make things possible that
[27:24] weren't possible uh previous or like a
[27:27] few years ago and stuff like that uh
[27:30] super interesting um so basically uh we
[27:33] have with CK rollups a possibility to
[27:38] build uh the traditional Financial space
[27:42] uh in a better way on top of Bitcoin
[27:45] with with borrowing against it like with
[27:47] other stuff um what are your um what are
[27:51] the use cases for those that you're most
[27:54] excited about like what are like if you
[27:56] think about in in 5 10 years uh and and
[27:58] you think like that that's the best case
[28:00] or like the best use case for that and
[28:03] that's probably also the the most
[28:04] mainstream use case of of
[28:06] that yeah so I I mentioned a couple of
[28:09] these but we'll Dr on to them one is
[28:11] just the user experience like I think
[28:13] it's it's difficult and clunky for
[28:15] people to store their own private keys
[28:17] and use Hardware wallets and while we
[28:20] should always educate about that and
[28:21] that is definitively the best way to to
[28:24] to store your Bitcoin if we want to Mass
[28:26] on board the world they're going to want
[28:28] something that feels a little friendlier
[28:30] to to to use Bitcoin and things that
[28:32] again are compatible with their their
[28:34] their smartphones but are still secure
[28:36] so the user experience is a huge one for
[28:39] me another one that I'm passionate about
[28:42] are uh you know Bitcoin de borrowing and
[28:44] Bitcoin back staple coins um there are
[28:48] ways to create you know credible not
[28:50] like teral Luna style Ponzi schemes but
[28:53] like real deal like highly secure and
[28:56] truly decentralized not centralized in
[28:58] name only but truly decentralized
[29:00] Bitcoin back stable coins and that to me
[29:02] is like a very powerful concept that we
[29:04] can go around to all of these you know
[29:07] things like Bitcoin jungle or Bitcoin
[29:09] Beach or the these kind of circular
[29:12] economies and say look Bitcoin is the
[29:14] revolution but we understand that stable
[29:16] coins are really really valuable so
[29:18] instead of using this centralized Fiat
[29:20] back stable coin that quite literally
[29:22] perpetuates the global sovereign debt
[29:24] crisis and perpetuates this problem that
[29:26] we're trying to fight against here's a
[29:28] Superior Bitcoin back stable coin that
[29:29] has censorship resistance and and you
[29:33] know getting people on board with that
[29:35] concept of using a Bitcoin back stable
[29:36] coin is is really cool and and that is
[29:40] to me a a stepping stone to
[29:42] hyperbitcoinization that people saying
[29:44] bit stable coins are really valuable
[29:45] right now Bitcoin back stable coins are
[29:47] a better version of this and eventually
[29:50] you'll see the revolution of of just
[29:52] using Bitcoin natively that's a natural
[29:54] progression for me the last thing I'll
[29:56] say here as I mention Bitcoin back
[29:59] borrowing I love companies like unchain
[30:02] and lein and huddle hoddle but frankly
[30:05] like these are these companies
[30:07] are uh not just centralized but they're
[30:10] they're also extremely expensive you
[30:12] know like like paying in the teens with
[30:15] like on interest rate and then like
[30:17] annual renewal fees and then like you
[30:19] know admin fees like it's very very very
[30:21] expensive and what we're seeing is on
[30:23] chain with smart contracts you can
[30:25] build frankly way Superior borrowing
[30:28] experiences that are much cheaper with
[30:30] much friendlier terms that are actually
[30:34] decentralized with provably like no
[30:36] rehypothecation no fractional Reserve no
[30:39] Financial Funny Business Like These are
[30:41] actually better than the trafi solutions
[30:44] and borrowing is something that I think
[30:46] every bitcoiner at least just wants to
[30:48] have the option to to have so those are
[30:52] a few of the use cases that I'm I'm I'm
[30:53] really excited about is that uh
[30:56] something that's already uh kind of
[30:58] Builder something that you can already
[31:01] kind of test out or is it something that
[31:02] you're looking forward in like a few
[31:03] years time it depends what you mean I
[31:07] mean some of this stuff exists on
[31:09] ethereum uh but the problem is if you
[31:11] want to try to use Bitcoin uh to use
[31:13] that stuff on ethereum you are trusting
[31:15] a centralized you know actor to to
[31:17] custody your funds so my recommendation
[31:20] is maybe people just want to test this
[31:22] out I don't know go throw a 100 bucks on
[31:23] there and just toy around with this
[31:25] stuff but understand that this stuff is
[31:27] coming natively to bitcoin where you
[31:30] will be able to interact with it without
[31:32] trusting any sort of centralized
[31:33] intermediary so it's it's still quite
[31:36] early I don't want to set wrongful
[31:37] expectations but the writing on the wall
[31:40] is clear about what's coming I partnered
[31:43] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[31:46] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:49] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:52] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:55] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[31:58] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:01] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:04] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:07] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:10] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:14] watch collections you have the date of
[32:16] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:19] there and of course also the block
[32:21] height and which EPO we are currently in
[32:25] I love the level of detail they put in
[32:28] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:30] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:33] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:36] love those watches so so much if you
[32:39] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[32:41] regular basis I'll guess you already
[32:43] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[32:46] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[32:49] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[32:52] personal recommendation for Hardware
[32:53] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[32:56] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[32:58] gift for a friend who has still the
[33:01] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[33:04] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[33:07] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[33:11] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[33:14] to really level up your sovereignty as
[33:16] an individual you have to have the most
[33:19] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:21] secure your own devices you have to
[33:24] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:27] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:29] where you live you even want to have a
[33:32] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:35] in case something goes really really
[33:36] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:38] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:41] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:44] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:48] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[33:51] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:53] okay so like uh you can basically test
[33:56] the technology out of it on ethereum and
[34:00] uh it's it's it's it's it's in the works
[34:03] that it comes the same thing directly on
[34:06] the
[34:07] Bitcoin yes yes
[34:09] exactly I I love that you brought up
[34:12] brought up stable coins because I think
[34:13] that's really an interesting thing I
[34:15] think we had it once before someone
[34:18] mentioned stable coins on top of Bitcoin
[34:19] so it's a fairly new topic also to the
[34:22] podcast um I think stable coins in
[34:26] itself uh but especially stable coins on
[34:29] top of Bitcoin it's kind of Trojan horse
[34:32] for Bitcoin it's like the the the slly
[34:36] around like it's a it's a small way of
[34:39] saying like hey you can use those
[34:41] Bitcoin Network and by the way that
[34:43] Bitcoin Network actually has a token and
[34:45] that token is way better than any stable
[34:47] coin but like using that stable coin as
[34:50] kind of a trojan horse for
[34:51] hyperbitcoinization it's an interesting
[34:54] concept that you brought
[34:55] up yeah I mean I I I've I've written
[34:58] about this you know for several years
[35:00] it's a very very very powerful concept
[35:02] and can create like an amazing flywheel
[35:04] I
[35:05] think I mean yeah how do I want to say
[35:07] this uh like you know we're kind of
[35:10] bringing tether right now to to bitcoin
[35:12] like that's a big narrative that that
[35:13] tether is now GNA come on Lightning
[35:14] Network and I'm just kind of like all
[35:16] right hooray cool like but that that's
[35:18] not what I'm in this revolution for you
[35:20] know I'm not here to perpetuate tether
[35:22] to a trillion dollars and allow the US
[35:24] government to to continue borrowing and
[35:26] and and bringing every went into the
[35:28] debt trap and causing Mass you know uh
[35:30] like surveillance and uh uh uh you know
[35:34] eventually inflation like that's not the
[35:36] freaking Revolution that I signed up for
[35:37] you know I'm here for freaking Bitcoin
[35:39] and um and so yeah like this this this
[35:42] concept of Bitcoin back stable coins I
[35:44] think it's very credible and I think it
[35:46] it it will and it should take over and I
[35:47] think a lot of bitcoiners who are like
[35:49] supporting and cheering things like like
[35:51] tether on lightning while I I I love
[35:53] tether I think they've been fantastic
[35:55] for Bitcoin I think that they are
[35:56] bitcoiners and while I love light light
[35:58] like I think that they're amazing
[35:59] company I'm just like guys like there
[36:01] there's a bigger Revolution that that's
[36:03] more aligned with our our ethos going on
[36:05] here so anyways I can get really fired
[36:07] up about this
[36:09] topic yeah but like what happens
[36:11] actually with t on lating I I I saw it a
[36:14] little bit but it was for me not as
[36:15] interesting because it's like they're
[36:17] using lightning not not Bitcoin uh so
[36:21] it's like they're using lightning is it
[36:23] like a layer free on top of of Bitcoin
[36:25] or how does this work what do you mean
[36:27] the Bitcoin back stable coins oh no yeah
[36:30] like what what they are doing with with
[36:32] teda on on Lightning ah well okay so I
[36:36] think first and foremost um they would
[36:39] issue the tether on bitcoin layer one uh
[36:43] using a kind of standard called top rout
[36:46] assets and so those tokens can actually
[36:49] be sent using Bitcoin uh uh layer one
[36:53] but you can lift is the terminology that
[36:56] you can lift those tether into the
[36:58] lightning Network and then send them via
[37:00] the the the channels on on Lightning but
[37:03] they'll be minted into existence first
[37:04] and foremost on the Bitcoin layer one
[37:06] interesting so
[37:09] it's but yeah I don't know why people
[37:12] get excited about it maybe I'm not
[37:14] getting it but but you're also saying
[37:16] like it's you're not excited about it
[37:19] well I think you know you you like a lot
[37:22] of these people that are trying to bring
[37:23] Bitcoin into Emerging Markets I think
[37:25] someone like Alex gladstein is a great
[37:28] example of this you know he's Chief
[37:30] strategy officer of the human rights
[37:31] Foundation uh or somebody like Lyn Alden
[37:33] who who people really respect like they
[37:35] they've gone out and been boots on the
[37:37] ground and and seeing that you know as
[37:40] much as we want to perpetuate this
[37:41] Bitcoin Revolution that that people
[37:42] really tremendously value stable coins
[37:45] like to the point where it doesn't
[37:46] matter how much we kind of preach about
[37:48] like you know Bitcoin is freedom
[37:49] technology and it's store of value like
[37:51] these people they don't have any value
[37:53] to to to to store like they're they're
[37:55] unwilling and unable to to take on the
[37:58] volatility of of Bitcoin and so they
[38:00] they just stable coins are 100%
[38:02] necessity and so this is the way of the
[38:04] bitcoin's community saying okay if if we
[38:06] can't get them on board with Bitcoin the
[38:09] asset yet let's at least give them
[38:11] stable coins but have those stable coins
[38:13] live on on on bitcoin rails and
[38:16] indirectly that could benefit Bitcoin so
[38:19] there's this kind of dissonance this
[38:21] tension between what the market wants
[38:22] versus like what we are trying to tell
[38:24] them they want yeah and it's a it's
[38:27] noral transition phase like between such
[38:31] a huge Revolution what's Bitcoin is like
[38:33] Bitcoin is the biggest Financial
[38:36] Revolution since a long long time
[38:38] arguably maybe like the biggest one we
[38:40] ever seen so absolutely with with that
[38:44] you
[38:45] naturally have a transition phase in
[38:48] there you naturally have bridging things
[38:51] in in there that just come from the free
[38:53] market because we cannot just switch
[38:55] like oh like we use now Fe and tomorrow
[38:58] we all will use Bitcoin like that
[39:00] doesn't work and I think it also not
[39:02] good like I think U we can touch on that
[39:05] actually now because of you said it in
[39:07] the beginning um of like we get caught
[39:09] up in that number go up technology uh
[39:12] and I honestly think it could even be
[39:15] bad if we rip too fast because if if
[39:19] bitcoin price rips too fast uh this also
[39:22] means that the Fiat system might
[39:24] collapse too fast because like those are
[39:26] very
[39:27] uh related to each other uh and and then
[39:30] it's like do we really want that like if
[39:33] you have a Titanic and you have uh and
[39:35] you you have that boat if that sinks and
[39:38] you know it will sink you want to keep
[39:40] it very low you want to organically it
[39:43] should slowly slowly SN that people
[39:46] actually have the time to to get out
[39:47] because we need time like we need time
[39:50] to build all those systems build all
[39:52] those uh Financial Services on top of it
[39:55] build all those great things that we can
[39:57] do that on on bitcoin uh and and the
[40:00] payment systems out there I think we're
[40:02] not ready yet for for 8 billion people
[40:05] on top of Bitcoin that's what I'm trying
[40:08] to
[40:08] say yeah I think I think there's two
[40:11] considerations here in regards to number
[40:13] go up I recognize like I'm in this for
[40:16] number go up you know like I own Bitcoin
[40:19] I you know I I want to become as wealthy
[40:20] as I as as I can and I understand that
[40:23] that is probably like the number one
[40:24] motivating factor for for bringing
[40:26] people in number go up and you know like
[40:29] Freedom technology go up um but there
[40:32] there's two considerations here I think
[40:33] the first one that that that you touched
[40:35] on is is yes if Bitcoin number goes up
[40:38] way too fast and it kind of like
[40:40] perpetuates this Global sovereign debt
[40:42] crisis and the entire world goes
[40:46] spinning into like chaos uh I don't care
[40:48] how much Bitcoin you have like we all we
[40:50] all lose there absolutely it it it sets
[40:52] the world on fire so I think a more
[40:54] gradual transition where you know as the
[40:57] Titanic sinks you kind of slowly bring
[40:59] the rescue boats and you kind of like
[41:01] all right peacefully kind of make that
[41:03] transition that that that would probably
[41:05] be in the best interest of like
[41:06] everybody in the world e even for
[41:09] bitcoiners I think the the second
[41:11] byproduct that I worry about uh from
[41:14] focusing too much on number go up is
[41:16] what I'm calling uh you know people
[41:18] selling their soul for for number go up
[41:21] and I think this is something that that
[41:22] that scares me at this size of Bitcoin
[41:25] you know trillions of dollars what makes
[41:27] number go up are people like Michael
[41:29] sailor and institutions and nation
[41:32] states and naturally those entities they
[41:36] have their own incentives and their own
[41:38] motives and are their motives kind of
[41:40] aligned with the ethos that that Bitcoin
[41:42] was built on like do they really care
[41:44] about you know keeping Bitcoin hyper
[41:47] decentralized maybe maybe because
[41:50] that'll keep number going up but do they
[41:51] really care about like making it
[41:53] scalable and non-custodial probably not
[41:55] because they want to to be the
[41:57] custodians like they want to capture the
[41:59] fees for for for providing services for
[42:02] for Bitcoin like does a nation state
[42:04] really care about privacy no like they
[42:06] probably want a surveillance State and
[42:08] so I worry that if we if we get too
[42:10] obsessed with number go up which again I
[42:12] am very Pro number go up but if we do it
[42:15] at the expense of of undermining the
[42:18] ethos that that Bitcoin was was built on
[42:21] and meant for I think that's like a very
[42:24] precarious and slippery path and I think
[42:26] people need to reexamined their priors
[42:28] about like why are they in this
[42:29] revolution you know are they in this
[42:31] just for for number go up or are you in
[42:33] this for the separation of money and
[42:35] state are you in this for you know
[42:36] Freedom technology and my intuition is
[42:39] that a lot of people who thought that
[42:41] they were in this for the revolution are
[42:43] really kind of thinking H like maybe I'm
[42:47] really not in this for the Revolution
[42:49] and I'm actually just in this for number
[42:50] go up and that's that's going to be a
[42:52] tension point in Bitcoin moving
[42:55] forward we
[42:58] I I see it where we are so obsessed with
[43:03] tracking what are the influ in ETFs
[43:06] we're so obsessed with like or what are
[43:08] nation states and and strategic Bitcoin
[43:10] Reserve are not doing and I get the
[43:12] importance of that and and I get how how
[43:15] important it is to onboard the
[43:16] traditional Financial space into Bitcoin
[43:19] it's one of those bridges that we have
[43:21] to build and it's important for the
[43:23] adoption um but honestly I much rather
[43:27] prefer um have having Grassroots
[43:31] adoption in in in Nigeria for example or
[43:35] like El Salvador in some some state
[43:37] where we where they actually need it uh
[43:39] and and having time for the plebs to
[43:43] actually uh buy more and more of them
[43:46] before Bitcoin actually rips through the
[43:49] millions and uh and and tens of millions
[43:51] of dollars um and the state can take
[43:55] time people probably will be
[43:57] disappointed if the USA doesn't do
[43:59] anything with Str strategic Bitcoin
[44:02] Reserve but I actually would be kind of
[44:04] happy because I know Bitcoin will be
[44:06] there for the long run maybe it's also
[44:08] because I'm young like maybe because I'm
[44:10] 26 I have my whole whole life in front
[44:12] of me and not behind me maybe someone
[44:15] that's listening now and is like 65
[44:17] you're like like I want Bitcoin to pump
[44:19] now in the next five years uh and and
[44:22] there are different incentives I get
[44:24] that and I respect that um but from my
[44:27] my personal perspective now like if if
[44:30] we have the next two years uh Bitcoin
[44:32] under 150k I would be very happy with
[44:36] that I I don't see it I think we we we
[44:40] will consistently be above it especially
[44:43] this year uh maybe next year also maybe
[44:45] we get some scratch I don't know like
[44:47] it's it's hard to predict but um uh
[44:50] lower prices is it's kind of a good
[44:53] thing if you understand uh if you
[44:55] understand Bitcoin I actually made a
[44:57] actually made a a poll on my YouTube
[44:59] communities asking what would you prefer
[45:01] for this year bitcoin price staying
[45:03] under 120k or bitcoin price ripping to a
[45:07] million and actually 40% saying oh I
[45:10] want to stay at under 12K this means
[45:13] like 40% actually understood the value
[45:16] proposition of Bitcoin yeah yeah it's I
[45:18] mean just be clear like we can have both
[45:20] we can have like Bitcoin at a million
[45:23] and not betray the ideals that that that
[45:26] make uh
[45:27] Bitcoin so great you know like we're not
[45:30] going to be forced to choose uh one or
[45:32] the other
[45:33] so yeah I I I think there's a lot to be
[45:36] excited about there so absolutely um
[45:39] just just quickly touching on that how
[45:41] do you see uh adoption going moving
[45:45] forward I I like the idea of gradually
[45:48] then suddenly even though I as I said I
[45:51] feel it it could be a major risk um but
[45:55] I I do like that idea of it hitting an
[45:58] es adoption and it's just like a game
[46:01] over at that point but how do you look
[46:04] at that uh is it diminishing returns is
[46:07] it ESC adoption uh what what are you
[46:10] seeing with with Bitcoin adoption moving
[46:12] forward I mean all systems seem like a
[46:14] go it it it would be odd to me if we
[46:18] didn't start seeing significant adoption
[46:21] uh like whether I I like it or not I do
[46:23] think nation states are acquiring I do
[46:26] think ETF inflows are happening I do
[46:29] think the importance of you know scarce
[46:32] assets like gold and then eventually
[46:34] Bitcoin are are really starting to to
[46:37] you know HD into effect so I am
[46:41] expecting significant adoption over the
[46:43] next you know two five 10 years and and
[46:47] and and maybe forever like there's
[46:49] nothing more powerful than you know a
[46:50] product who's whose time has come and it
[46:54] feels like Bitcoin is is right on that
[46:57] that precipice um I'll also add that
[47:00] that I think some of the stuff that that
[47:02] we're working on um with the ZK rollups
[47:04] like I do think that's going to
[47:05] massively contribute to adoption in in
[47:08] some of these more kind of smaller
[47:09] Emerging Markets like a lot of the stuff
[47:11] I just laid out is more applicable for
[47:13] nation states and institutions and ETFs
[47:15] and like big money but those like people
[47:19] in Emerging Markets like Nigeria or Els
[47:22] salador or Bhutan or you know name your
[47:24] kind of emerging Bitcoin Market like
[47:27] they don't have access to to to to those
[47:29] sorts of financial tools and so you know
[47:32] if we want this kind of gradually then
[47:35] suddenly adoption Beyond just like you
[47:37] know big swinging dick whales like
[47:38] owning all all the Bitcoin yeah we we we
[47:41] need to build out some of these um these
[47:43] tools that I kind of mentioned like
[47:44] these more expressive layer twos uh
[47:47] whether it's ZK rollups or lightning or
[47:48] fediman like all of those are great
[47:50] solutions they have different trade-offs
[47:51] but like that's that's the grassroot
[47:53] movements that that I think really
[47:54] really gives us the Esra of adoption
[47:57] that that we want absolutely yeah that's
[48:00] really interesting um you said in the
[48:02] beginning you have a Libertarian
[48:05] background uh what do you mean by that
[48:08] and and what uh what was your background
[48:10] in in that uh well I always joke uh
[48:14] sometimes people will post on Twitter
[48:15] they say Hey you know tag the person
[48:16] that got you into Bitcoin and I always
[48:18] tag Peter Schiff um be because Peter did
[48:22] kind of like influence um me early on in
[48:25] my life and and eventually into bit like
[48:27] when I was in uh college which was back
[48:29] around like 2011 and
[48:31] 2012 um you know I was reading some of
[48:33] these libertarian Bibles like uh like IR
[48:35] Rand and Atlas Shrugged and the Fountain
[48:37] Head and I didn't understand that there
[48:39] was this whole big libertarian movement
[48:41] I was just reading those books and I
[48:42] thought wow like this is just like
[48:43] fascinating like this resonates deeply
[48:45] with me and I I you know would would go
[48:48] online and find you know some of these
[48:49] Niche groups and Peter Schiff like you
[48:51] know as much as we make fun of him like
[48:53] really was quite active uh in in some of
[48:55] those movements early on and he used to
[48:57] go down to uh you know to Wall Street
[48:59] during like the the the uh you know Wall
[49:01] Street protests and you know ask people
[49:03] about capitalism and and you know preach
[49:05] the gospel of gold and scarce assets and
[49:08] and yeah I mean I used to enjoy those
[49:10] videos and he was very influential in
[49:11] some of my thinking and so then many
[49:13] years later when I see him debating
[49:15] people like Vorhees or pom or like name
[49:17] name your favorite bitcoiner I would be
[49:19] like oh you know like my old buddy Peter
[49:21] Schiff what's he up to and I'm listening
[49:24] to him in in in these debates uh and I'd
[49:27] be like wow these Bitcoin people are are
[49:28] making a lot more sense and and and then
[49:31] you know you fall down the rabbit hole
[49:32] like everybody says and you know you see
[49:35] how Bitcoin touches on everything in
[49:36] your life but that that's kind of a
[49:38] long-winded way of me saying how I went
[49:40] from these you know early kind of
[49:41] libertarian ideas you know um eventually
[49:45] to discovering
[49:48] Bitcoin H it's Peter shift was actually
[49:51] also my first Bitcoin
[49:53] video I I think it was between Eric and
[49:57] him it was a debate on bitcoin versus
[49:59] gold as it's always is with him and and
[50:01] it was such a great video it was like uh
[50:05] with a great format I forgot the the
[50:08] channel name but it's a really great
[50:10] format if you type in uh Eric for has
[50:13] and and and Peter shiff debating gold
[50:15] was a Bitcoin it's probably the first
[50:17] video that pops up um and it's also then
[50:20] had like question of the the the the
[50:22] audience which I actually some of the
[50:24] question I actually had while listening
[50:26] to it and the audience actually asked it
[50:29] uh and this was literally the first um
[50:32] the first actual Bitcoin video that I
[50:34] kind of looked at uh and it really
[50:36] orange spilled me from from the get girl
[50:39] like oh that's so interesting because I
[50:41] didn't get why we need Bitcoin in the
[50:43] first place H so I also never understood
[50:45] gold and then I looked into Bitcoin and
[50:47] I found that video uh and it was perfect
[50:49] because they explained both the the
[50:52] problem really good uh and in the
[50:55] solution uh Peter just didn't make any
[50:57] sense but he made a lot of sense
[50:59] describing the problem uh and I truly
[51:02] believe that Peter shift doesn't get
[51:04] enough credit for orange ping people
[51:07] like I talked to so many people that
[51:11] kind of or slightly got orange ped by
[51:14] Peter shiff like he is he he's orange
[51:18] peing more people than the average PL
[51:20] out there like like he's doing a lot of
[51:24] orange ping work um and I hope he has
[51:27] some Bitcoin honestly I I do hope that
[51:30] he has some
[51:33] but maybe actually doesn't and maybe
[51:36] actually is is as as
[51:40] um as resistant to bitcoin as as he
[51:43] actually appears to be but he is a great
[51:46] orange pill I feel like yeah yeah I mean
[51:49] Pier sh he kind of reminds me of my dad
[51:51] where it's like uh very stubborn and
[51:54] very opinionated and very kind of like
[51:56] Boomer but amongst all of that there's
[51:58] some very Sage advice um in in in what
[52:02] he's saying I do think um I I know his
[52:04] son Spencer at one point like had
[52:07] Bitcoin now he's kind of like big into
[52:08] the whole AI is Gonna Save the World and
[52:10] I don't know how much he's into Bitcoin
[52:11] anymore but I thought that there was a
[52:13] path there where I almost like you know
[52:15] I make the comparison to to Star Wars
[52:17] that like you know Anakin Skywalker like
[52:19] eventually became Darth Vader and he was
[52:21] like he was the chosen one like he was
[52:23] supposed to bring like you know balance
[52:24] to the force and you know Darth Vader or
[52:26] an like ended up not doing that in this
[52:28] case you know it's Peter Schiff uh but
[52:30] he's like being Redeemed by his his son
[52:33] and that's this kind of like character
[52:35] Arc of of the Next Generation like
[52:37] picking up the torch and and and and
[52:40] redeeming like the kind of Revolution
[52:42] that his dad started so that was my My
[52:43] Hope for the the shift family
[52:46] Dynamic yeah and he could really have
[52:49] had a built on top of that I think like
[52:52] any any podcast would have brought him
[52:54] on like oh like why my dad is wrong
[52:58] about
[52:59] Bitcoin it would have been been great uh
[53:02] having him as a Bitcoin I don't even
[53:04] know if if he was ever on a podcast or
[53:06] on a Bitcoin podcast but uh his Bitcoin
[53:09] scene was was kind of shortlived um I
[53:12] have a question that I asked each and
[53:13] every one of my guests and the question
[53:14] is um what can we learn from you besides
[53:18] Bitcoin oh man uh so much my life has
[53:20] been consumed by
[53:22] Bitcoin um well you know my my new
[53:26] session is is is pickle ball if
[53:28] anybody's trying to uh you know find uh
[53:31] uh you know Hobbies outside of of of of
[53:33] Bitcoin I think that's an interesting
[53:35] one uh I also you know I've gone down a
[53:39] lot of the longevity Rabbit Hole I think
[53:41] that's been another kind of passion of
[53:43] mine um is seeing like what's happening
[53:45] there and and and uh you know if you
[53:48] want to talk about like you know low
[53:50] time preferences well you know that's a
[53:52] big Topic in in Bitcoin you know imagine
[53:55] if
[53:57] you know you could live beyond 100 years
[53:59] you could live 200 300 500 like a
[54:01] thousand years like like what if humans
[54:03] can can essentially be immortal in the
[54:05] same way that like Bitcoin kind of broke
[54:07] our brains and you know caused us to to
[54:10] think in lower time preferences like
[54:11] what if your actual biological life can
[54:14] can also provide that to you that sends
[54:16] you down like a whole different meta of
[54:18] of really understanding the long-term
[54:20] implications of Bitcoin because you will
[54:22] actually be around here to to see it and
[54:25] there's early signs
[54:27] that you know maybe technology and and
[54:31] and some of this biology stuff that
[54:33] people are researching like maybe
[54:34] there's some legitimacy to this like
[54:35] maybe you know we're not bound by our
[54:38] human bodies and aging and and we can
[54:40] kind of like transcend beyond that so um
[54:44] yeah that's another topic that that that
[54:45] interests me that's super interesting um
[54:49] I think one of the guys that currently
[54:51] is popularizer popularizing that is
[54:54] how's he called pre Johnson
[54:57] the guy who also had the Netflix do and
[55:00] it's it's an interesting thought because
[55:02] we do get older uh and you wonder of
[55:06] like maybe biology and medicine is at
[55:09] some point so good that we can add every
[55:12] year two more years to your life where
[55:15] you basically are Immortal at that point
[55:19] outside of like you get hit by a bus and
[55:21] stuff like that but it would make me
[55:25] feel really
[55:27] I don't know I I do like that death
[55:29] death H because it it makes you value
[55:32] your
[55:34] time it's a weird thing saying I do like
[55:37] that their St but
[55:40] um imagine how afraid you would be if
[55:43] the only way you would die is through
[55:46] accidents and and and and get hit by bus
[55:49] and and weird things like that I think
[55:51] people would be way more scared in
[55:53] general and and and would be way more
[55:56] like okay like I can relax now uh and
[56:00] and and just lay back and do nothing and
[56:02] maybe I do it tomorrow a little bit like
[56:05] let's let's take it real real slow uh
[56:08] because if a DI is over and now because
[56:11] people now there's like okay you only
[56:14] have one life like you you you have like
[56:16] this finite amount of time for everyone
[56:19] at some point it's over but if if at
[56:21] some point it's it's not for everyone
[56:23] over like that has that has interesting
[56:27] implications on on on society that uh
[56:32] yeah I'm that's a fascinating topic it's
[56:34] not something that I'm I'm deeply
[56:36] researching but it's something that uh
[56:39] I'm I'm sometimes funny discussing with
[56:43] with some friends in it is it is
[56:45] interesting to think about like what if
[56:48] people don't
[56:50] die what happens then yeah I mean it
[56:53] arguably is like the quintessential like
[56:55] s cow so to speak in our society it's
[56:58] just something that people always assume
[56:59] like you can never uh cheat death and so
[57:02] many of our kind of societal and
[57:04] cultural myths so to speak even things
[57:06] like religion are kind of dependent on
[57:08] this idea that that you know you will
[57:10] have an end of life um and I agree with
[57:14] you it could lead to some crazy wacky
[57:16] incentives in human behavior and and and
[57:19] and things that we've never actually uh
[57:21] seen before but maybe you know who knows
[57:25] maybe the AI overlords come in and and
[57:27] they build up something and you can you
[57:29] know copy your brain and your thoughts
[57:31] to a hard drive and if you're meat sack
[57:34] ever uh you know gets bonked in the head
[57:37] and you die it's like well all right
[57:39] we'll just uh you know restore from hard
[57:40] drive restore from cloud and you know
[57:43] you get a new meat sack so uh I don't
[57:45] know there's a lot of ways that it can
[57:48] go that that's not a thing that I didn't
[57:50] even
[57:51] consider like you can probably back up
[57:55] your Your
[57:58] Existence exactly you're like oh I I I
[58:01] should not forget to back up today like
[58:03] oh I did not back up for a whole
[58:05] week if if I die now I fall back to last
[58:08] Sunday like what a weird what a weird F
[58:12] like that that's crazy if you look back
[58:15] at some point like could you imagine in
[58:17] 2025 you could still
[58:20] die yes yes exactly I think there's
[58:23] actually I think there's a I just saw
[58:25] the credit for I think like a Robert
[58:26] Paton movie that's coming out like a
[58:28] similar concept of this and and yeah
[58:32] like his life just constantly like
[58:33] reboots and I think at one point he he
[58:35] meets a clone of himself or something
[58:37] maybe I'm getting the plot wrong here
[58:38] but there is something like that that
[58:40] futuristic thing where it's like whoa
[58:43] like you duplicated my my brain into
[58:45] another body here I
[58:47] mean I I clone my voice already uh
[58:52] because I have so many recordings I can
[58:55] easily clone my voice and honestly with
[58:57] trust of War you don't know if it's a I
[58:59] or
[59:00] me it's literally that good
[59:03] already uh with the video be worried
[59:05] right now on this call is this is this
[59:07] the real real
[59:08] Robin like H actually I think we're not
[59:13] that far away of that being not like
[59:16] right now this it's real
[59:18] Robin would the the AI character also
[59:21] say but uh the video I think is not
[59:25] quite there yet but the audio is already
[59:27] so good uh it probably needs a lot of
[59:31] processing power and a lot of like uh
[59:33] you you touch something on me and I
[59:35] immediately react to that so like AI I
[59:37] think is like sometimes still a little
[59:39] bit too slow especially if you have to
[59:41] imitate the voice and and stuff like
[59:43] that but that's a problem you can solve
[59:45] easily um and then it comes to like okay
[59:48] but if you also just upload everything
[59:51] onto that eii not just the voice IM but
[59:53] also your memories uh what you know know
[59:56] what what is your thing and someone like
[59:59] me with like like almost 500 hours of
[60:02] long format a video on that that would
[60:05] be extremely powerful just to plug into
[60:08] an AI and it probably can imitate me
[60:10] really good and at some point like I I
[60:13] can just put my character on there and I
[60:15] go skiing and and and my guests speak
[60:18] with an AI character and uh and and mo
[60:22] most maybe don't even recognize that and
[60:25] and maybe you also put your AI character
[60:27] on there and do AI character talk to
[60:29] each other and people listen to that
[60:32] yeah I mean I don't want to sound like
[60:33] too morbid here but but you know kind of
[60:35] what you're saying is like you have so
[60:38] much data to to train these AIS on which
[60:41] is amazing and like I think about this
[60:43] in the context of of my parents you know
[60:45] my parents are are are getting older
[60:46] like they're I think you know
[60:48] approaching their 70s and like it does
[60:51] cross my mind I'm like do I want to
[60:52] start getting content of them like do I
[60:54] want to start accumulating photos and
[60:57] videos and recordings and and like would
[61:01] it be a shame that if God forbid like
[61:03] something ever happened to them that
[61:05] like I just only have memories of them
[61:08] but you know like if I actually had
[61:09] enough content of us just you know have
[61:11] these memories of us just like sitting
[61:12] together at to family and having coffee
[61:14] and you know just like chitchatting and
[61:16] and and like these like fond memories
[61:17] that I have like like if I just had
[61:19] cameras and videos like everywhere in
[61:20] our house you know like surveillance
[61:22] stayed on my my my my parents like would
[61:25] I be thankful that I can essentially
[61:26] recreate them in in in this future Ai
[61:29] and like that is honestly a really cool
[61:31] thought that I've had but I just I
[61:32] haven't had I don't know what the right
[61:34] word is like
[61:35] the like The Willpower to to be like hey
[61:38] like we're going to plant cameras
[61:40] everywhere in in your house so that if
[61:42] something happens to you I can like
[61:43] remember you like that's just like a
[61:44] very awkward conversation to have with
[61:46] with with with my parents but but that
[61:48] that thought has crossed my mind like um
[61:51] you know if this Ai and Longevity stuff
[61:52] doesn't hit for the next like 10 years
[61:53] like are they gonna miss out on that
[61:55] Wave It's just
[61:57] it's very interesting thoughts Al then
[61:59] you can maybe like even you you can
[62:04] clone them put them on like an AI thing
[62:08] put put like some some sack around them
[62:11] uh and and they actually like almost
[62:13] like live and that's an interest that's
[62:16] why it came to my mind of like uh being
[62:18] Immortal um maybe with having so much
[62:21] content online you're already Immortal
[62:24] it it's like how how amazing would be if
[62:26] like AI imitates like a Steve Jobs or
[62:30] someone that is recent history where we
[62:32] already have some interviews and stuff
[62:34] like that and we know how he fought and
[62:35] and we have records of that H and and we
[62:38] we can just like imitate him and like
[62:40] ask Steve Jobs question of like oh what
[62:43] would he say to that obviously yeah I
[62:45] would speculate to certain part uh but
[62:48] but it it it opens it opens the whole
[62:51] whole flat gate and now it everything is
[62:53] recorded people upload massive amounts
[62:56] of of data online I mean I'm a prime
[62:58] example I'm I'm literally having 365
[63:02] podcasts uh in a year that are usually
[63:05] over one hour long that's a lot of video
[63:07] content if I accumulate over let's say
[63:10] the next 50 years like that's a that's a
[63:13] lot of content to train an AI on he
[63:16] probably can he probably can imitate me
[63:18] better than myself because he knows more
[63:20] about me than I can remember in my brain
[63:24] exactly yeah I keep on that really
[63:26] really powerful we're already seing
[63:27] early indications that this stuff is
[63:28] possible I mean the Steve Jobs example I
[63:30] mean you could just go tell chat GPT
[63:32] right now to to imidate Steve Jobs and
[63:34] like it could probably pass a touring
[63:35] test absolutely really cool uh we have
[63:38] an end in the podcast um where the the
[63:41] previous guest is asking a question for
[63:43] the next guest without knowing who the
[63:44] next guest actually is and uh the
[63:47] previous guest asked you the question
[63:49] how can you see Bitcoin used for the
[63:52] creation of Art in the future
[63:55] for the how can Bitcoin be used for the
[63:58] what H for the creation of art I think
[64:00] what what he wanted to say with that
[64:02] question was more of like what impact
[64:05] will Bitcoin have on art and culture and
[64:09] and all those creative Outlets uh uh
[64:13] with like like what difference does
[64:16] sound money versus feeld money make on
[64:19] Art and all those
[64:21] things yeah uh well I think that um art
[64:26] and culture like a a natural uh like a
[64:30] necessary prerequisite for that is the
[64:32] ability to have freedom like like not
[64:34] just like economic and and and monetary
[64:37] freedom but just you know property
[64:38] rights in general and and and that's
[64:40] what I see before Bitcoin even as money
[64:43] like Bitcoin is is a tool for for human
[64:46] property rights like like normally in
[64:47] order to have a free Society you first
[64:49] and foremost need freedom of of yourself
[64:51] you need agency of of of your own self
[64:53] and ownership of your own thoughts but
[64:56] after that you you need the ability to
[64:58] have property rights to to take the
[64:59] fruits of your labor some sort of time
[65:01] that you put into society and then be
[65:03] able to store that as value in something
[65:05] that nobody can steal from you nobody
[65:07] can can debase from you that ability to
[65:09] have property rights is the single most
[65:11] important facet of of and building block
[65:14] of a of a free society and normally we
[65:16] have to have some sort of government
[65:17] some sort of Fiat system that says we
[65:19] have a big gun uh you know we're going
[65:21] to give you freedom because we will use
[65:22] our big gun to to protect those rights
[65:24] from you but with Bitcoin like we allow
[65:26] people all around the girl world even if
[65:29] they don't have the these functioning
[65:30] governments to have this sense of of
[65:32] property rights and and then ultimately
[65:35] that leads to to the ability to have
[65:37] freedom in a more freely functioning
[65:40] Society anywhere in the world and I
[65:42] think once people have that once they
[65:44] have freedom of themselves and and
[65:47] freedom to own property and then
[65:49] eventually freedom to to to to save
[65:51] money that opens up the ability to have
[65:53] creative Pursuits and and you know we
[65:56] talked about Bitcoin is how like Jeff
[65:58] Booth talks about how the scarcity of
[66:00] Bitcoin ultimately leads to the
[66:02] abundance of society like that's such a
[66:04] a a you know mental Brain Buster but
[66:07] like once you understand that that we
[66:08] can have abundance in society that
[66:10] allows people to avoid doing like
[66:13] productivity and going and Digging Holes
[66:15] and Building buildings and all this
[66:16] stuff to instead say like I'm going to
[66:18] pursue my my highest form of self like
[66:21] I'm going to go through this maso's
[66:23] hierarchy of needs this
[66:24] self-actualization and the very top of
[66:26] that it's like my own personal uh
[66:28] Pursuits of creativity so I know that
[66:30] was a long-winded answer but where I'm
[66:32] going with this is that Bitcoin ushers
[66:36] in an age of abundance and once you have
[66:38] abundance you are free to
[66:40] pursue arts and culture and romance and
[66:43] love and like all these these kind of
[66:45] like greater Pursuits in in
[66:48] life I think that's a great answer I
[66:50] think it shows like the what what
[66:53] Bitcoin actually enables on on a big
[66:56] scale I I I do like that really cool um
[66:59] Before I Let You Go um where can people
[67:02] find you where can people ask questions
[67:04] reach out to you and DM you uh you can
[67:06] find me on Twitter uh davidor Croy s is
[67:11] and Sam e r o y uh just you know don't
[67:14] pass any judgment for anything I say on
[67:16] Twitter yeah usually we shouldn't do
[67:20] that thank you so much uh David for for
[67:23] being on the show was was a pleasure
[67:24] having you also thank you so much for
