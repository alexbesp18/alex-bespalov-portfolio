[00:00] you're buying something for 60,000 today
[00:02] for it to be worth a million tomorrow
[00:04] meaning 10 15 years down the line the
[00:06] American dream is not available to a lot
[00:08] of Americans I'm sure many people in
[00:09] Europe feel the same way many people in
[00:11] Australia probably feel the same way
[00:12] each person gets 300,000 Satoshi if you
[00:15] have a million SATs that is over three
[00:17] times what the average person will be
[00:19] able to have that's the equivalent of
[00:21] having 3x the median networ you're going
[00:24] to watch bitcoiners get richer over time
[00:27] which is then going to continue to
[00:28] incentivize you to move to that standard
[00:30] 1 million SATs is probably enough for
[00:32] you to retire sometime 2045 inflation is
[00:35] like a compounding issue once it starts
[00:37] to get out of hand you can't really rein
[00:40] it in why am I paying for Social
[00:41] Security if it's going to run out in
[00:43] 2035 we don't have enough money coming
[00:46] in the United States as insolvent for a
[00:48] house 1970 you needed about 14,000
[00:51] minimum wage hours today you're going to
[00:53] need 57,000 when inflation goes up they
[00:56] are stealing your time you control your
[00:58] impulse today in order to prosper
[01:00] tomorrow Bitcoin is a brain Bank the
[01:02] 2025 blue run can change your life if
[01:04] you look at the Bitcoin chart and then
[01:05] you zoom in to all the times before it
[01:07] blew up it looked exactly like what it
[01:09] looks like right now you are going to
[01:10] 10x your company by doing no extra work
[01:12] why would you not do it I think more
[01:14] people are going to be adopting this
[01:15] strategy individuals and
[01:17] [Music]
[01:20] corporations CH C uh and Bitcoins like
[01:24] you call yourself cheny BDC uh it's a
[01:27] really interesting topic first of all
[01:29] like I'm still gen C A lot of people
[01:32] would put me in the Millennials bracket
[01:34] but I'm actually like two years too
[01:36] young for that to be in the Millennials
[01:38] pcket so like I'm still Chen z uh and
[01:42] Chen Z for for now it's I think like 13
[01:45] years or 12 years till like 27 something
[01:49] around those that bracket is Chen Z
[01:51] right now because I know not not
[01:53] everyone knows exactly where to to break
[01:56] down those lines so why is uh owning
[02:00] like Bitcoin in general a big deal for
[02:04] for genz and I also saw you made a um a
[02:07] video around like why owning 0.1 Bitcoin
[02:10] is a big deal uh so maybe let's uh first
[02:13] like talk General about Bitcoin for Chen
[02:15] and then maybe a little bit about the
[02:17] the demount of 0.1 Bitcoin yeah so first
[02:20] thank you so much for watching my videos
[02:22] that's amazing uh and the reason why Jin
[02:25] Z in my opinion has to focus on to
[02:29] bitcoin is for a couple reasons but the
[02:31] first one is they have the most
[02:33] uncertain future of any generation prior
[02:37] right the further you go back in history
[02:39] the more certain the future looked for
[02:41] people right so people maybe in the you
[02:43] know 1920s The Roaring 20s you know you
[02:46] go to school you get your job at the
[02:48] factory and you're able to take care of
[02:50] your family right just one guy working
[02:53] can take care of his wife his two or
[02:55] three kids and his dog uh you know what
[02:57] I mean they got a they have a uh
[02:59] everything that they need all right
[03:01] there's not a lot of worry in terms of
[03:03] economy at that time you go a little bit
[03:05] further into the future let's say 1950s
[03:07] it's the same song and dance things
[03:08] really haven't changed too much uh
[03:10] housing is still affordable in fact it
[03:13] becomes a great investment a lot of the
[03:14] Baby Boomers who bought houses right
[03:16] they might have bought something for
[03:17] like 50,000 uh 60,000 and today it might
[03:21] be worth a million you know what I mean
[03:24] uh interestingly I think that we have a
[03:26] unique opportunity today to do the same
[03:28] thing that is is buying a Bitcoin you're
[03:31] buying something for 60,000 today for it
[03:33] to be worth a million tomorrow tomorrow
[03:36] meaning like 10 15 years down the line
[03:39] right uh go a little bit further into
[03:41] the 1970s right this is when we start to
[03:43] get off the gold standard and now things
[03:45] start shifting okay um people are still
[03:48] able to afford things because the rate
[03:49] of inflation has not impacted them yet
[03:52] but this is where it starts this is
[03:53] where it begins all right uh you're
[03:55] still in a position where you can even
[03:57] ask your parents your parents probably
[03:58] grew up uh well maybe maybe not but they
[04:00] were kids you know when they were kids
[04:02] they understand that things were a lot
[04:05] cheaper than they are today right you go
[04:08] a little bit further into the future now
[04:10] you're in the 1990s early 2000s these
[04:12] people um they have to deal with um you
[04:15] know insane Financial collapses like
[04:17] 2008 uh the cost of living is slowly
[04:20] creeping up now it starts to look like
[04:21] for the Millennials right that's when
[04:23] they were kids they've grown up now and
[04:25] now they're seeing oh wait a minute this
[04:26] is not as easy and as simple as my
[04:28] family made it out to be you know some
[04:30] people are getting to that age today
[04:32] where they're like I did everything I
[04:33] was supposed to do you know I went to
[04:35] school I went into debt to get my degree
[04:38] I play by the rules I worked my 9 to5
[04:41] and now it doesn't seem like I'll be
[04:42] able to take those steps when it comes
[04:45] to uh okay first an apartment then home
[04:47] ownership then you get your car then you
[04:49] get a nicer car and then you take care
[04:50] of a family then you have kids it seems
[04:52] like a lot of these steps in life uh the
[04:54] American dream as it's sold is not
[04:57] available to a lot of Americans and I
[04:59] can't speak on the rest of the world I'm
[05:00] sure many people in Europe uh feel the
[05:02] same way uh many people in Australia
[05:04] probably feel the same way uh but we in
[05:07] America the dream of being able to have
[05:10] ownership over your assets is slowly
[05:13] going away that's why they talk about
[05:14] you'll own nothing and be happy right so
[05:17] there's even there's even a retirement
[05:19] crisis right because pensions your job's
[05:22] not coming to save you Social Security
[05:24] is running out that's going lower and
[05:26] lower uh it just seems like there's no
[05:28] money for anyone but somehow the 1% keep
[05:32] getting richer and richer and that keeps
[05:34] growing while the middle class and Below
[05:36] keep shrinking uh so for that reason I
[05:39] think gen Z is very inclined to look
[05:42] into a system that works in their favor
[05:44] and not against them absolutely really
[05:46] cool I I think you laid it down laid it
[05:49] out really really nicely also um and
[05:52] what is now to to protect yourself
[05:54] against what you just like described and
[05:55] going into depth for for student loan
[05:57] and and all those uh weird things you
[05:59] can do uh to make your life really
[06:02] really hard in the beginning um how do
[06:05] you protect yourself now with Bitcoin
[06:07] it's like 0.1 Bitcoin actually enough
[06:09] for doing that uh and and to to protect
[06:12] yourself for for the long-term future
[06:14] because it's I make some videos around
[06:16] like retiring on bitcoin and stuff like
[06:18] that H it's interesting for me because
[06:21] sometimes I get that feedback of like oh
[06:23] yeah like we need you need at least like
[06:25] three to five Bitcoin to retire and I'm
[06:27] like I don't know if you need that much
[06:28] depending on how old are and when you
[06:30] want to retire but 0.1 Bitcoin still
[06:33] seems like a a a low number uh but it
[06:37] probably depends on like the the year's
[06:39] Outlook and and and when you want to
[06:41] retire right yeah so there are a few
[06:44] different tools that you can use um rot
[06:47] has a look up rot Bitcoin you'll find
[06:49] him uh he was a I believe a former CPA
[06:52] and uh great great guy a lot of great
[06:54] information he has a tool that you can
[06:57] download on Excel in order to track how
[07:00] much savings you would have over time if
[07:02] you saved a certain amount of Bitcoin
[07:04] and what the compound annual growth rate
[07:05] would be Michael sailor also has a tool
[07:07] it's called Bitcoin 24 you can download
[07:09] it on GitHub uh it's another spreadsheet
[07:11] Excel you can also use that Tool uh if
[07:14] you have a business or if you're an
[07:15] individual to see exactly how much your
[07:17] Bitcoin will be worth uh under the
[07:19] assumption that the compound growth rate
[07:21] is a certain percent now for reference
[07:23] over the last four years the compound
[07:25] annual growth rate has been 55% so just
[07:28] keep that in mind uh I do think that
[07:30] number will actually go up a lot of
[07:32] people say no it's going to go down
[07:33] towards 20% I think it'll go up here's
[07:36] why you have to think and you have to
[07:38] realize maybe two to 3% of the world
[07:42] currently is using Bitcoin right that
[07:45] means that you are majorly ahead of the
[07:47] curve Everyone likes to say oh I wish I
[07:49] could have bought Apple before they
[07:51] brought dropped the first iPhone uh okay
[07:55] this is your iPhone moment all right why
[07:57] is 0.1 so valuable let's break it down
[08:00] by the Numbers an individual if Bitcoin
[08:04] were divided evenly across all people
[08:06] right let's just do 21 million divided
[08:08] by 8 billion right you get
[08:14] 0.265 something like that that can be
[08:17] converted into about
[08:20] 256,000 Satoshi right 256 265 something
[08:25] like that let's just call it 300,000
[08:27] each person gets 300,000 Satoshi if you
[08:30] have a million SATs um that's
[08:34] 0.1 right 01 is over three times what
[08:40] the average person will be able to have
[08:42] that's the equivalent of having 3x the
[08:45] median net worth okay the average net
[08:48] worth um you'll be far beyond that right
[08:52] you'll be three times excluded from that
[08:55] and that number is actually incorrect
[08:56] 300,000 is incorrect it's lower than
[08:58] that because of people like Michael
[09:00] sailor because of people like me because
[09:02] of people like Black Rock because I have
[09:04] way more than the average already and
[09:06] I'm not selling my BTC because I don't
[09:09] want to sell my finite asset for
[09:12] something that is infinite that's where
[09:14] the value comes from and um I believe it
[09:17] was safine amus the writer of the
[09:21] Bitcoin standard he talks about how
[09:24] ignoring someone with a harder money
[09:26] than you will be impossible so what
[09:29] happens is you're going to watch
[09:31] bitcoiners get richer over time which is
[09:34] then going to continue to incentivize
[09:36] you to move to that standard but there
[09:39] will not be enough for everyone and in
[09:41] order to get ahead of that mad dash for
[09:44] Bitcoin where we see that Gap up in
[09:46] price that's extremely quick and
[09:49] extremely violent um you would probably
[09:52] want to have at least the average amount
[09:54] before that happens for that reason
[09:57] that's why I'm saying that's enough for
[09:59] you to retire what's the time frame use
[10:01] some of those tools but if I had to
[10:03] guess I would say
[10:04] 01 1% not 10% not 10 million 1 million
[10:08] SATs is probably enough for you to
[10:11] retire sometime like 20 45 uh maybe yeah
[10:15] probably 2045 it's interesting I just
[10:18] pulled that up with uh so you can also
[10:20] see it uh there is the Apparently in
[10:24] 2092 I I just like quickly Googled that
[10:27] uh the average wealth because I never
[10:29] ask myself the question of like what's
[10:31] the the average adult wealth uh and it's
[10:35] apparently 85,000 and if you think that
[10:37] like compare 85,000 with like 300,000 um
[10:42] Sates that's like that's amazing and
[10:44] then there's inflation coming along and
[10:47] it's really interesting to to look at
[10:49] the those numbers of like the average
[10:51] wealth right now of an individual and
[10:53] then think of like in a Bitcoin standard
[10:55] world it's hard to predict the timing of
[10:57] that when when there is a Bitcoin
[10:58] standard and and when it will be there
[11:01] uh and Bitcoin will be that dominant but
[11:03] the average wealth of then uh having
[11:06] like 300,000 Bitcoin maybe even lower
[11:08] than that because we have lost some
[11:10] Bitcoin and uh the the the distribution
[11:13] is uneven like that will be people that
[11:16] have one Bitcoin will be people that
[11:18] have 10 Bitcoin there will be people
[11:19] that have like 100,000 Bitcoin and and
[11:22] more than that so like uh it's probably
[11:24] more like like 200,000 or like 100,000
[11:27] something like that uh so maybe like
[11:29] 85,000
[11:31] satosi yeah as now with the satosi
[11:34] dollars parity it's really interesting
[11:35] to look at that I love how you seed yeah
[11:38] no and um to speak on the average one
[11:41] more time like you have to understand
[11:43] there's going to come a point where the
[11:46] average income for everyone in America
[11:48] will be $1 million and that's like whoa
[11:51] that's insane there's no way that's
[11:53] possible bro you need to understand
[11:55] 85,000 if you had
[11:57] 85,000 like 50 years ago you're pretty
[12:01] rich okay if you had $85,000 and that
[12:05] was your like average income in
[12:08] 1970 you're you're very wealthy you're
[12:11] extremely wealthy if you take it back
[12:14] another 50 if you go back a hundred
[12:16] years and you have
[12:17] $85,000 you're rich you are literally
[12:20] rich in real life all right but now if
[12:24] you have 85,000 you're doing okay all
[12:26] right in some places you're poor okay if
[12:29] you have 85,000 in like Boston or like
[12:31] certain places in New York or like San
[12:33] Francisco certain places in California
[12:35] like you're not really wealthy you're
[12:37] not like super rich you're barely
[12:39] average you know uh you might be a below
[12:41] average you know it might be kind of
[12:43] hard for you to find a place to live
[12:45] comfortably if you're by yourself doing
[12:47] 85 right uh and there's going to come a
[12:49] point where eventually that continues
[12:52] that's going to continue even in uh a
[12:55] place where like the cost of living is
[12:56] low like Louisiana or like Mississippi
[12:58] uh the average income there will become
[13:01] 85,000 which means the average income in
[13:03] a place like New York will be like
[13:05] 200,000 300,000 but these people won't
[13:08] be richer they will just need more
[13:10] pieces of paper to buy stuff okay good
[13:13] example is eggs eggs from today eggs 50
[13:16] years ago eggs 100 years ago if you want
[13:18] to talk about antibiotics and steroids
[13:20] and all this other stuff for the most
[13:22] part the eggs are the same they're just
[13:24] eggs they come from chickens okay
[13:26] they're just eggs but the price of eggs
[13:29] has gone up 5 10x why does this keep
[13:33] happening the price never goes down only
[13:34] goes up it's not that the eggs are more
[13:38] valuable the eggs require more pieces of
[13:41] paper for you to purchase your pieces of
[13:44] paper have gone down in
[13:46] value that is a really important concept
[13:49] for people to understand but like most
[13:51] people don't even frame their mind in
[13:54] that way you know it's always like oh no
[13:56] the price of egg is getting more
[13:57] expensive we can produce more eggs per
[14:00] person because our technology and our
[14:02] ability to farm and manufacture eggs has
[14:05] gotten a lot better we actually produce
[14:07] more eggs that means the price should be
[14:09] going down but the price is actually
[14:12] going up cuz our our money is being
[14:14] inflated faster than we can uh deflate
[14:17] the cost of eggs uh Jeff Booth has an
[14:19] entire book on that it's called the
[14:20] price of Tomorrow absolutely amazing
[14:22] absolutely I just want to point
[14:24] something out and I love it a lot you
[14:27] tell there's like one two I like I don't
[14:29] know if what tool you are using usually
[14:32] uh but that's I like it because it's an
[14:34] online Tool uh the Bitcoin fire
[14:36] calculator did you see that already
[14:37] sometime no I have a website it's called
[14:40] a priced in Bitcoin uh that also shows
[14:42] something very interesting it shows how
[14:44] on a chart everything goes down in cost
[14:47] if you're saving in Bitcoin but this is
[14:48] awesome tell me about this yeah it's
[14:51] interesting um because it's basically
[14:53] there are like different models of like
[14:55] how Bitcoin will uh appreciate the next
[14:58] few years and it's interesting because
[14:59] use that like you think the compound uh
[15:01] annual growth rate will go up but there
[15:04] it's actually like even the most bullish
[15:06] model Like the Model Seven uh assumes
[15:08] that it goes down significantly yeah and
[15:11] if you just like take that and take like
[15:13] the the middle model the model four and
[15:16] put like 0.1 Bitcoin in there and as you
[15:19] said I think you said before
[15:21] 2045 uh and and then from 2045 you then
[15:25] take out um
[15:27] $330,000 but proba that's probably the
[15:30] the thing that you you is is wrong
[15:33] because here you probably need more in
[15:34] dollars if the dollar is still around
[15:37] and and maybe it's not called dollars
[15:39] but whatever tax rate is also hard to
[15:42] calculate because it's different for
[15:44] everyone in the in the world uh but just
[15:46] like that uh small uh starting point
[15:49] with like 3,000 EUR uh and you you
[15:52] calculate that down then to 2045 you
[15:55] really get into big numbers where you
[15:57] have in the first year where you want to
[15:59] take something out already like this
[16:02] 450,000 EUR uh and then like just like
[16:07] eight years later over a million so I
[16:10] think I think uh those models are uh
[16:14] interesting but I think they are
[16:17] assuming that we don't have
[16:19] hyperinflation and that inflation stays
[16:21] in the under control and that's always
[16:24] my problem with those models where like
[16:28] I think think inflation will be way
[16:31] worse than most people think right now
[16:35] how do you foresee uh inflation uh
[16:38] within the next like couple of of
[16:40] decades and years maybe uh and do you
[16:44] think that that we have a chance of
[16:45] having normal normal inflation even
[16:48] though I don't think inflation is normal
[16:50] at all right uh but like normal
[16:52] inflation I mean like having like a
[16:54] three four
[16:55] five% uh inflation Target even like we
[16:59] we all know like inflation is not
[17:00] calculated from a zero point we have to
[17:03] calculate the productivity offset in
[17:04] there uh then inflation is not CPI
[17:07] inflation is whatever you want to buy
[17:10] but let's take that all
[17:13] besides do you think that even like CPA
[17:16] will will stay like maybe 5% or
[17:18] something like that um I just don't
[17:20] think it's possible so inflation is like
[17:22] a compounding issue right uh once it
[17:25] starts to get out of hand you can't
[17:27] really reain it in so at least in the
[17:29] United States I'm pretty sure the debt
[17:31] to GDP is like
[17:33] 130% currently right like America has
[17:36] bills that they cannot pay so what
[17:38] they're doing is they're taking a credit
[17:40] card to pay off a credit card to pay off
[17:41] the last credit card right now the
[17:44] question is Jack MERS asked this
[17:45] question a lot uh who's going to pay the
[17:48] bill who's going to realize the loss
[17:50] right and the loss is realized through
[17:53] individuals the the loss is realized in
[17:55] a very sneaky way all right and it's by
[17:58] infl in uh the money away so that you
[18:01] have a higher cost of living and the
[18:03] people who borrow money get to
[18:05] continually stay uh afloat because they
[18:08] just get to borrow infinitely right
[18:10] there's no cost to them the cost is on
[18:12] us so on top of that you have certain
[18:15] things that you just can't pay for so we
[18:18] have trillions of dollars of unfunded
[18:20] liabilities that's Social Security
[18:23] that's Medicare Medicaid uh all these
[18:26] different things that we're promising
[18:27] people hey don't worry we're going to
[18:29] take care of you in the future this is
[18:30] another reason why gen Z needs Bitcoin
[18:32] why am I paying for Social Security if
[18:35] it's going to run out in 2030 20 35
[18:38] anyway that's not even goingon to I'm
[18:40] not even going to be able to use it and
[18:41] I pay for it every check uh seems kind
[18:44] of seems kind of like a scam right uh if
[18:47] I'm going to be uh paying into these uh
[18:51] government funded programs that won't be
[18:54] funded by me anyway what are the two
[18:56] options that they have maybe three they
[18:58] can increase my taxes even more right
[19:01] they can uh print more money and go into
[19:04] debt and just print the money for the
[19:06] for the old people or um they can just
[19:08] get rid of the programs like hey guys
[19:10] you know what no more Social Security no
[19:11] more Medicaid sorry you're on your own
[19:14] and none of those seem attractive but
[19:15] most likely they're going to foot the
[19:17] bill to me hey we're just going to
[19:18] increase your tax rate even more even
[19:20] though it's already like 41% uh when it
[19:22] comes to natural disaster Florida just
[19:25] had two hurricanes back to back really
[19:27] bad ones uh FEMA right which is our like
[19:30] disaster relief group here in America
[19:33] they are basically saying yeah we're
[19:35] bankrupt like we have no money there's
[19:36] too many natural disasters we don't have
[19:38] enough funding and there's always going
[19:39] to be tornadoes earthquakes massive
[19:42] fires hurricanes um whether you want to
[19:45] blame that on a change in the climate or
[19:46] whatever you want to say regardless they
[19:48] are happening and someone has to pay for
[19:50] that stuff uh and you don't have the
[19:53] money you just got to print it the
[19:55] military budget is literally smaller
[19:57] than the interest on the debt all right
[20:00] so there's no way out of the hole we
[20:02] don't have enough productivity we don't
[20:04] have enough money coming in to pay for
[20:07] all the money going out that's called
[20:09] being insolvent right the United States
[20:11] is insolvent and soon the game will
[20:14] unwind that's why All These Bricks
[20:16] countries are getting into buying gold
[20:18] and buying Bitcoin and Mining Bitcoin
[20:20] and um I think they see the writing on
[20:22] the wall pretty soon the average person
[20:24] will also see the writing on the wall
[20:26] and the deficit will affect them in a
[20:28] really direct way right now it affects
[20:30] them indirectly soon it'll be direct and
[20:32] impossible to
[20:34] ignore it's also interesting when you
[20:36] talk about uh taxes because like in a
[20:38] Bitcoin World um you don't really have
[20:42] the possibility to have the inflation
[20:45] tax on on top of PE people what do you
[20:48] think will that impact uh Society
[20:51] individuals governments when all of a
[20:54] sudden this hidden tax that everyone
[20:57] feels but nobody really can point to
[20:59] because they're like they just know that
[21:01] prices go up but most people don't know
[21:04] that it's because of the money printing
[21:06] like if you go out on the street I bet
[21:07] you like nine people out of 10 say as an
[21:10] answer like oh because Ukraine
[21:12] war because Russia because of whatever
[21:15] but they don't point to the actual real
[21:18] reason why we have inflation what
[21:20] happens if we don't have that anymore
[21:22] yeah no I think um and you're completely
[21:25] right I'm actually going to start doing
[21:26] Street interviews where I'm going to
[21:27] give people shees for answering
[21:29] questions about Bitcoin that's how I'm
[21:30] going to try to stand out in my Niche
[21:32] but um it's definitely something people
[21:35] don't think about and they're not
[21:37] totally wrong when you say oh because
[21:38] the United States going to war yes like
[21:40] partially that is part of the problem
[21:42] the United States has so many proxy wars
[21:44] going on at once and we're funding them
[21:46] how are we funding them we're funding
[21:48] them by printing money how do we print
[21:50] money we issue debt we issue treasury
[21:53] issue bonds and that comes back to bite
[21:55] you uh eventually right back in the day
[21:58] if you wanted to go and fight a war you
[22:00] had to get with the citizens and be like
[22:01] all right listen guys we're going to
[22:03] increase taxes we're going to have a
[22:04] little bit of a depression things aren't
[22:06] going to be great but we have to fight
[22:07] this war who's with me right and if they
[22:10] wanted to fight the war they say yeah
[22:11] let's go let's go let's go smash those
[22:13] guys right but today no one wants to go
[22:17] fight these wars they don't know
[22:18] anything about the ukrainians or
[22:20] Russians or Israelis or Palestinians
[22:23] they don't the average American knows
[22:25] nothing about this stuff anyway and when
[22:26] you tell them we're going to war to go
[22:28] fight them they're like like why I don't
[22:29] want to do that I don't want to do that
[22:30] I don't I don't even know them and
[22:32] you're going to tax me and you're going
[22:33] to make me poor to go to the war no I'm
[22:34] not funding that but today you don't
[22:37] need permission from citizens you just
[22:39] go do the war and then print the money
[22:40] later right so that's how we get caught
[22:43] up in the system in terms of how it will
[22:45] affect people it it leads people to get
[22:48] their time back so I actually wanted to
[22:50] talk about this I I have a couple of
[22:52] stats here uh so how do we get our time
[22:54] back with Bitcoin uh because the amount
[22:58] that people will have to work if the
[23:00] inflation tax goes away the inflation
[23:02] theft goes away you get a lot of hours
[23:04] back so some numbers uh in 1970 right
[23:08] the this is based off the minimum wage
[23:10] the amount of minimum wage hours you had
[23:12] to work in order to go to college public
[23:15] four-year University you have to work
[23:16] about 246 minimum wage hours today you
[23:20] have to work 1,500 minimum wage hours
[23:23] right to get a car in 1970 you needed to
[23:26] work about 2100 minimum wage hours today
[23:30] you'd have to work 6,600 so three times
[23:33] more minimum wage hours to get the
[23:35] average car and then finally for a house
[23:39] 1970 you needed about 14,000 minimum
[23:42] wage hours today you're going to need
[23:45] about 57,000 so again nearly three times
[23:49] a little bit more than three times more
[23:50] in minimum wage hours to get the average
[23:52] house okay uh that means you are
[23:56] literally losing time when inflation
[23:59] goes up they are stealing your time your
[24:02] most valuable asset is being stolen from
[24:05] you and if you can get your time back
[24:08] you're able to focus on the things that
[24:09] you care about the things that matter to
[24:11] your life your passions okay your
[24:14] passions might not be uh monetizable
[24:17] right you might not be able to monetize
[24:18] your passion because of that that might
[24:21] steer you away from doing your passion
[24:23] okay it's like oh well if I can't make
[24:24] money doing it then I can't feed myself
[24:26] and I can't do it and I can't whatever
[24:27] whatever with Bitcoin I think more
[24:29] people will be able to follow their
[24:32] creative passion uh their life's mission
[24:35] right nobody's life mission is to be a
[24:38] greeter at Walmart it's not their life
[24:40] mission I really don't believe that you
[24:42] have a greater life mission and Bitcoin
[24:45] allows you to pursue that uh because you
[24:47] don't have to worry about the money you
[24:49] just have to worry about living your
[24:52] life I I love that a lot also like the
[24:55] uh making things affordable again like
[24:58] taking the the monetary premium out of
[25:00] housing uh taking the monetary premium
[25:03] out of weird things and then making
[25:05] everything more affordable I love that
[25:08] uh bringing time as the most valuable
[25:11] asset back in the world I think Bitcoin
[25:13] really Bitcoin really will shine a light
[25:17] on that and I just was like in in
[25:19] Amsterdam a few days ago uh or like when
[25:22] this comes out a few weeks ago uh and
[25:24] this is where I saw so many people
[25:28] who really value their time a lot and
[25:31] I'm not talking about the people that
[25:32] work in Bitcoin or something like that I
[25:34] work about the I talk about the people
[25:37] that work a normal job yeah normal in
[25:40] terms of not
[25:41] Bitcoin but they at the Bitcoin
[25:43] conference because they're interested in
[25:45] it and they really value their time
[25:48] differently like not even the people
[25:49] that work in Bitcoin obviously they are
[25:51] way deeper in that but even the people
[25:53] that just adopt the Bitcoin standard for
[25:55] themselves like it's it's crazy what
[25:56] Bitcoin does to us
[25:59] yeah no and to speak on the time thing
[26:01] one more time like uh a way to think
[26:04] about it is you have to frame it like
[26:05] this right not only are you working
[26:07] three times harder to get the same thing
[26:09] that someone else had in the past um you
[26:12] have to think of your job like when you
[26:13] go to work when you have your job right
[26:16] you kind of already know all the days
[26:18] that are scheduled out in front of you
[26:20] okay if you project that you're going to
[26:21] stay at your job for 10 years and you
[26:23] work Monday through Friday if there was
[26:26] a calendar in front of you all of those
[26:27] Monday through Fridays in the future are
[26:29] all booked right you know okay I have to
[26:32] be here this time this place to do this
[26:34] function all those Monday through
[26:35] Fridays they're all the way in out in
[26:37] the future that's time that's already
[26:39] set aside that is um taken from you
[26:43] right because your time is dedicated
[26:45] towards someone else making someone else
[26:47] Rich that's your time set up in the
[26:49] future what Bitcoin does right and as
[26:52] you get richer um right you're able to
[26:55] take days off the calendar you're taking
[26:59] time from the future and you're bringing
[27:00] it to the present right you're taking
[27:03] that future time back okay for instance
[27:06] if you win the lottery right let's say
[27:08] you win A1 billion doll Lottery all
[27:10] those days that you had scheduled for
[27:12] work they technically go away all the
[27:14] future time is gone you take it to the
[27:16] present because all of your monetary
[27:18] energy that you would have made from
[27:20] working those days is now in the present
[27:22] you were able to get that future value
[27:24] immediately by winning the lottery when
[27:26] you buy Bitcoin Bitcoin is slowly taking
[27:30] the value from those future days that
[27:31] you would have been working and it's
[27:33] bringing it to the present your value
[27:36] and your purchasing power is going up so
[27:38] fast that the amount of days you'll have
[27:40] to work is slowly getting cut down it's
[27:44] slowly cutting those Future Days out and
[27:47] then eventually you will more soon
[27:49] sooner rather than later you'll be able
[27:51] to um enjoy your present right Bitcoin
[27:55] allows you to enjoy your present um
[27:58] ironically you actually have to not
[28:00] consume in the present in order to enjoy
[28:02] it um but it it's a game of of patience
[28:05] right you buy Bitcoin you wait you
[28:07] continue to stack and eventually you
[28:09] will be able to consume 10 times more
[28:11] than you would have had you used it
[28:13] impulse buy impulse buy you control your
[28:16] impulse today in order to prosper
[28:19] tomorrow yeah that's really interesting
[28:21] um also like the I think you had I think
[28:24] it was you that also had a a video
[28:26] around like Bitcoin is a B inside your
[28:28] pre I did not see the video but I saw
[28:30] the title when I saw saw your saw
[28:32] YouTube page I was like that's an
[28:34] amazing concept um first of all like how
[28:39] why is that like what what is your like
[28:41] feces behind Bitcoin is a Bank inside
[28:43] your brain uh why is said like okay and
[28:48] this is really harder for privileged
[28:50] people to realize but when you're not as
[28:52] privileged you need to realize Jews in
[28:55] World War II uh a lot of people in World
[28:57] War II really um even Japanese people in
[29:00] World War II Vietnamese people during
[29:02] like the Vietnam War uh Cubans during
[29:05] like uh Fidel Castro like um rise to
[29:08] power and like communism if they had
[29:09] assets they had to try to leave because
[29:10] they didn't want to have their assets
[29:12] socialized um uh people in China you
[29:15] know I mean uh and multiple times
[29:17] through history there are many times
[29:19] through history where people are
[29:21] persecuted and they have to leave where
[29:24] they're at okay regardless of whatever
[29:27] reason they have to leave or they're
[29:29] going to die okay rwandans okay Rwandan
[29:32] Genocide okay you could say uh
[29:34] Palestinians today you could say
[29:36] Israelis today whatever you want to say
[29:38] someone is being persecuted and they
[29:40] have to leave or they're going to get
[29:42] smoked all right when you have to leave
[29:45] you can't take your house you can't take
[29:47] your business you can't take your bank
[29:49] you cannot take your stocks you can't
[29:50] even take your gold you try to bring
[29:52] your gold through an airport today try
[29:55] to bring three bars of gold through an
[29:56] airport they're going to scan it it's
[29:58] going to beep they're going to be like
[29:59] what is this guy doing what is this guy
[30:01] doing did you steal this yeah you stole
[30:03] it matter of fact we're going to hold on
[30:04] to this thank you right try going
[30:06] through an airport with
[30:09] $500,000 right please try that put that
[30:11] in a duffel bag they're going to scan it
[30:13] they're gonna be like oh this guy is a
[30:14] this guy's a scammer and a thief all
[30:16] right something's going on here
[30:17] something's wrong with this guy
[30:18] something's weird is happening here here
[30:20] we're GNA pull you to the side we're GNA
[30:21] ask you a couple questions all right
[30:23] especially if you're trying to leave the
[30:25] place right if you're one of the bad
[30:27] guys okay one of the people being
[30:29] persecuted and you try to leave they're
[30:31] going to question you and they're going
[30:32] to take all your stuff all right Bitcoin
[30:35] is a brain Bank Bitcoin is your Bank of
[30:39] America inside your head it is your
[30:41] stocks inside your head when you know 12
[30:43] words right I have my 12 words memorized
[30:46] I can get on a plane and come to where
[30:48] you live you know what I mean I could go
[30:50] to your house and I have all my economic
[30:52] energy because you have an internet
[30:54] connection and I'm say Hey man can I get
[30:55] on your computer I need to download my
[30:57] money you know what I mean I need to I
[30:59] need to get my money really quick you
[31:01] know and that's really all there is to
[31:03] it and that is amazing no one can take
[31:06] your Bitcoin from you and you can never
[31:09] lose it as long as you remember right so
[31:12] that's very powerful that's super
[31:14] powerful uh not only that you can send
[31:16] remittance you know if I want to send
[31:18] money to you you're in a different
[31:19] country obviously there's going to be a
[31:21] fee if I use Western Union if I use
[31:23] remitly I can send money to you for free
[31:27] there's a fee that you you pay on the
[31:28] Bitcoin Network right because you have
[31:29] to pay the miners miners do work the
[31:31] least I can do is pay them a small fee I
[31:34] can pay Robin without having to have a
[31:37] middleman in between that's amazing that
[31:40] is truly amazing absolutely and I I
[31:43] brought that up in the podcast quite
[31:45] quite a lot actually uh because I think
[31:47] it's such a great example um I have a
[31:50] sponsor with coin vigilante that they
[31:52] are sitting in America and I sitting
[31:54] obviously in Austria uh and we first
[31:57] want to go the route with like a Fiat
[32:00] payment and poting the banking rod
[32:02] numbers and all those things and then we
[32:04] like that's that's so complicated we
[32:07] didn't even get to the point where we
[32:09] discussed the fees of this uh transfer
[32:13] but we were before that already we like
[32:16] oh man that's such a headache I don't
[32:18] even know where this banking routing
[32:20] number is in my fi bank because I've
[32:23] never did a a transfer over that long uh
[32:26] and then I was like hey let let's just
[32:29] let's just do it with Bitcoin like why
[32:31] not just do the transfer in Bitcoin and
[32:34] it was on a Sunday evening and it was
[32:36] done in like under 10 minutes and he
[32:38] sent it I got it it was perfect it was
[32:41] on chain it was on bitcoin the fees was
[32:43] so so small like
[32:46] 0.001% or something like that off the
[32:48] total amount like it was ridiculously
[32:51] small uh the fees so it's like it's it's
[32:53] an amazing experience and everyone I
[32:57] think that that sends money around the
[33:00] globe from like I don't know Ukraine to
[33:03] or Ukraine is an extreme example but
[33:04] maybe even like Hungaria do do the
[33:07] states or Australia uh they will see
[33:11] that it is so much easier so I just
[33:14] wanted to emphasize your point with like
[33:16] a real world example because it is so
[33:19] much easier it's like no headache at all
[33:22] and like like you have to think when we
[33:25] have new technology people are so used
[33:27] to Tik Tok and things going fast and
[33:29] like I need now now now now now dude be
[33:32] humble okay calm down low bro just just
[33:36] breathe we have to take time for
[33:39] technology to work the first people to
[33:42] use credit cards I guarantee you the
[33:45] first people to use credit cards they
[33:46] walk into a place like here I'm going to
[33:47] use my plastic to pay not everywhere was
[33:50] accepting credit cards okay you need to
[33:53] wait for the infrastructure to be built
[33:54] out all right people probably made fun
[33:56] of them they're like dude you can't pay
[33:58] with plastic you're an idiot look at
[34:00] this nerd he's using a credit card like
[34:02] dude let them work let them cook okay
[34:06] let them build stuff and eventually
[34:08] everything gets easier and easier why
[34:10] are they going to continue to build it
[34:12] because I guarantee you the person who
[34:14] invented the um the on rail for the
[34:17] credit card is Rich entrepreneurs are
[34:19] looking to solve problems so the more
[34:22] people who make things like the liquid
[34:23] Network the lightning Network all right
[34:26] uh who are making different Bitcoin
[34:27] wallets who are integrating like apple
[34:30] and you know Bitcoin together people who
[34:32] are doing these type of things they're
[34:34] going to make a lot of money you're
[34:35] solving a problem you're reducing the
[34:37] friction and you're making it easier for
[34:39] people to pay and use Bitcoin right now
[34:42] I can pay people using cash app cash app
[34:44] is my easy way I'm just like hey let me
[34:46] send you 10,000 Satoshi or let me send
[34:48] you 100,000 let me cover the dinner here
[34:51] I scan it and it shows people oh that
[34:52] was actually pretty easy you know and
[34:54] it's only going to get easier eventually
[34:56] we're going to have a card the same way
[34:58] we do right now we're going to tap our
[34:59] card and that'll pay in Satoshi you just
[35:02] have to give people time to build the
[35:03] technology not everything happens in one
[35:06] day you just have to give it time if you
[35:08] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[35:10] regular basis I'll guess you already
[35:12] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[35:14] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[35:18] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[35:20] personal recommendation for hardw wallet
[35:22] is the bit box it's super secure it's
[35:25] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[35:27] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin
[35:30] on an exchange and you can get a 5%
[35:33] discount with the code Robin at the
[35:35] checkout visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin
[35:40] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[35:42] to really level up your sovereignty as
[35:45] an individual you have to have the most
[35:47] secure self custody setup you have to
[35:50] secure your own devices you have to
[35:53] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:56] an inheritance plan and depending on

[36:22] and last but not least I have something
[36:24] completely new for you guys I partnered
[36:28] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[36:31] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[36:34] saw created by anyone look at that
[36:37] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[36:39] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[36:43] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[36:46] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[36:48] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[36:52] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[36:54] new and amazing Genesis Edition of their
[36:58] watch collections you have the date of
[37:01] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[37:04] there and of course also the block
[37:06] height and which EPO we are currently in
[37:10] I love the level of detail they put in
[37:12] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[37:15] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[37:18] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[37:20] love those watches so so much that's why
[37:23] I think satosi Nakamoto is the biggest
[37:26] and best founder ever because he solved
[37:28] the
[37:29] biggest uh problem ever with like where
[37:32] do I store my financial energy like
[37:34] that's that's that's that's a huge
[37:36] problem and he just like SED that with a
[37:39] small white paper with a few pages like
[37:41] that's that's still amazing for me to
[37:43] think about one thing that uh one thing
[37:46] that I wanted to uh point out uh when
[37:49] you mentioned the airport which is
[37:51] really interesting for me um do you
[37:53] think at some point they will start uh
[37:56] looking at like Hardware wallets when
[37:59] when you go through the airport uh do we
[38:01] do we have to hide our our Hardware
[38:03] wallets in like laptop things like
[38:05] there's like Hardware wallets I know
[38:07] that look like a phone so but but but
[38:10] still they are kind of suspicious I
[38:12] guess we have to make a hardware wallet
[38:13] that looks like an iPhone that that us
[38:15] just like take with you and it's just
[38:17] like it just looks exactly like an
[38:19] iPhone and you you don't even know the
[38:21] difference uh till you really like
[38:23] activated or something like that uh do
[38:25] you think that that could be a problem
[38:28] here's the thing this is what's amazing
[38:30] you don't need the hardware wallet like
[38:31] the hardware wallet doesn't actually
[38:33] hold the Bitcoin it's about being able
[38:36] to move your keys and sign transactions
[38:39] right so right now I could smash my
[38:41] Hardware wallet into pieces and my
[38:43] Bitcoin will be okay because I know the
[38:45] recovery seed um and when you know the
[38:48] 12 words you don't have to bring the
[38:50] wallet if anyone ask you any questions
[38:52] dude I don't even know what Bitcoin is
[38:53] and matter of fact bitcoin's a scam
[38:55] bitcoin's a scam what do you mean
[38:56] officer I don't know what that is uh let
[38:58] me through the airport please thank you
[39:00] and then you get on the plane you have
[39:01] your 12 words in your head and you can
[39:03] go wherever you're going like that's
[39:05] amazing you don't need the hardware
[39:06] wallet it's about you studying your 12
[39:09] words three times a day uh that that's
[39:12] extreme that's if you want to really
[39:13] memorize it but you write down your 12
[39:15] words you read it before bed you do that
[39:17] for a week you plan your Escape you get
[39:19] your passport and then you leave you you
[39:22] can leave everything else it's fine you
[39:24] can leave and you can bring your money
[39:26] with you you can bring your economic
[39:28] value with you right so I think that's
[39:32] so amazing and Powerful it's
[39:35] awesome absolutely you you said you are
[39:38] from America right yes yes it's
[39:41] interesting um what what do you think
[39:44] Bitcoin will do for people that weren't
[39:47] um born in in let's say more privileged
[39:50] countries like you in America or me in
[39:52] Austria where like uh like even like the
[39:56] the under the the the the the the more
[40:00] poor uh half of the civilization is
[40:03] still like way better off than in some
[40:05] other parts of the country what do you
[40:07] think uh Bitcoin will do to the let's
[40:11] say let's call it the victims of the
[40:13] Fiat system yeah money system yeah no
[40:17] 100% like um we're already kind of
[40:20] seeing it right we could say El Salvador
[40:22] was a poor country right they don't have
[40:24] a high GDP like they don't have a really
[40:26] high net worth per per per capita um so
[40:29] we'll just use El Salvador as a great
[40:30] example El Salvador so far has been able
[40:33] to reduce their crime massively they've
[40:36] been able to boost their economy
[40:38] massively they're increasing the
[40:40] standard of living for the people who
[40:42] are who are there and they're also
[40:44] moving away from having to rely on the
[40:47] IMF the international monetary uh fund
[40:50] and the World Bank they're moving away
[40:52] from them they don't need their debt
[40:54] they are now self Sovereign that is
[40:58] insane and they're they're they're going
[41:00] to be more well off than a lot of
[41:03] Western countries all right in my
[41:05] opinion I think that the true first
[41:08] world and if you ask people in
[41:10] comparative politics they're going to
[41:11] say well there is no first third or
[41:13] second world that doesn't that isn't
[41:14] real that's just a term that we use but
[41:16] like in in the in the third world all
[41:19] these countries are going to leap over
[41:22] they're going to jump over like if the
[41:24] United States is here or let's just say
[41:25] any country that has no Bitcoin right
[41:28] now if you're in the western word
[41:28] Germany Germany Germany is a Western
[41:31] Country it's a pretty good country right
[41:33] um Germany's right here they have no
[41:34] Bitcoin in the future Bhutan uh
[41:38] Argentina uh Costa Rica uh El Salvador
[41:42] they're going to jump over Germany all
[41:44] right they're going to literally leap
[41:46] over them and Germans will have to
[41:49] realize oh wait a minute we're actually
[41:52] losing to people who have harder money
[41:54] than us that's why again Bitcoin
[41:56] standard you cannot ignore someone who
[41:59] has harder money than you it's just not
[42:02] possible that you you cannot be
[42:03] delusional enough it's not possible to
[42:05] do that because you're going to watch
[42:07] your life get worse and you're going to
[42:08] watch their life get better and if
[42:10] you're rational you're going to try to
[42:12] get on the same standard as them
[42:14] absolutely I love that a lot it's like
[42:16] that that sound money standard and that
[42:20] I think that's the best way to Orange
[42:22] Peel people being that positive role
[42:25] model that has their saving things in
[42:27] Bitcoin therefore they get better time
[42:29] therefore they get to be more happy
[42:32] therefore they get to be more uh
[42:35] spending time with things they actually
[42:37] love doing and uh it's it's it's really
[42:40] interesting to to see um family members
[42:44] reacting to that because even like in my
[42:48] family even though like my family there
[42:51] is nobody really poor they're all like
[42:53] middle class there's nobody really
[42:56] extremely rich nobody really extremely
[42:58] poor like it's an average kind of middle
[43:01] class family in Austrian standards yeah
[43:05] um but they see already that I'm doing
[43:10] every day what I love to do I don't go
[43:12] to a job that I hate and I'm just like
[43:15] so young and I just like do on the
[43:17] internets and interview people every day
[43:20] I mean I work really hard like I work
[43:21] like 70 80 hours sometimes in a week
[43:23] yeah but I I I do it with full passion
[43:28] and I love doing that and even if you
[43:31] would give me like uh a million euros
[43:34] per month I would still do that I I like
[43:37] doing that I I hate just laying on the
[43:39] beach or something like that but maybe
[43:40] that's I don't know how much that has to
[43:42] do with Bitcoin uh but showing your
[43:46] environment that you're happy successful
[43:49] and and good uh will Orange Peel people
[43:52] if they connect you to bitcoin I think
[43:54] that's the best way to passively Orange
[43:56] Peel people
[43:57] yes uh how much time do we have left do
[43:59] you know oh you we can go along as as
[44:02] you want like okay um okay listen that
[44:06] is so true and I wanted to talk about
[44:09] let's like transition like how do we
[44:10] advertise Bitcoin technically Bitcoin
[44:12] does not need advertisers right it does
[44:14] it by itself but um at the same time we
[44:17] want to accelerate adoption because we
[44:20] want to try to help the people that we
[44:21] care about right even the people we
[44:23] don't care about uh technically don't
[44:25] care like I don't know all the people
[44:26] watching this so you could say I don't
[44:28] know you I don't really care about you
[44:29] like I don't know you watching this but
[44:31] regardless you're a human and you were
[44:33] born on Earth so I have some sort of
[44:36] obligation to you that's my obligation
[44:38] to you I feel like if we were born on
[44:39] the same Planet then I have some level
[44:42] of obligation to try to help you you
[44:44] know what I mean I have no reason or no
[44:46] incentive to hate you or to try to hurt
[44:47] you I only have an incentive to try to
[44:49] help you now if you give me a reason to
[44:51] hate you then yeah what I'll say is okay
[44:53] you know what you should go save dollars
[44:55] and put them under your bed put them
[44:57] under your mattress that's what I'll
[44:58] tell you if I hate you because I know
[44:59] that'll make you poor right but because
[45:02] you know you want to try to help people
[45:03] you tell them hey you know you should
[45:05] try to invest into something uh or try
[45:08] saving in because you're not necessarily
[45:09] investing in Bitcoin an investment is
[45:11] something you plan to sell in the future
[45:13] I think you should try to save in
[45:15] Bitcoin saving in Bitcoin gives it the
[45:17] connotation that that's your new money
[45:19] right and um being like a positive and
[45:24] uh just knowledgeable and helpful person
[45:27] is the best way to advertise for Bitcoin
[45:29] living on a Bitcoin standard is the best
[45:31] advertising for Bitcoin and there's
[45:33] going to be people who will make fun of
[45:36] you they will kind of ask you sarcastic
[45:39] things right uh when Bitcoin goes down
[45:42] they will laugh at you they might talk
[45:43] about you behind your back they might
[45:45] think that you're crazy they might think
[45:46] that you're not actually very smart they
[45:48] will think that they are smarter than
[45:50] you they know more than you um and in
[45:52] some cases you know what maybe they do
[45:54] but when it comes to bitcoin and what
[45:56] Bitcoin presents you have to have a
[45:58] certain level of humility and realize
[46:01] that many people anyone who's ever
[46:03] really tried to change something in the
[46:05] world uh they had to endure a little bit
[46:08] of push back some people that was
[46:10] physical violence to be fair they're not
[46:12] beating up bitcoiners in the street so
[46:13] we're very privileged we just get made
[46:15] fun of and called idiots online and
[46:17] that's okay right it's not about you
[46:19] yelling back like no you're an idiot
[46:21] you're an idiot like no like you have to
[46:23] be humble and be like okay that's fine
[46:26] when you are ready I here when you're
[46:29] ready I here because everyone has like a
[46:32] bit of an ego and we all want to like
[46:34] rub it in the faces of people who are
[46:35] mean to us but rubbing it in their face
[46:39] is owning Bitcoin that is rubbing it in
[46:42] their face it's like oh my God this guy
[46:44] bought it when it was 60 now it's a
[46:46] million oh my God you know what I mean
[46:48] that is rubbing it in their face so uh
[46:51] there's no need to be rude it's just
[46:53] about being informational and trying to
[46:55] help people easier said than done but
[46:57] you do have to just be humble yeah and
[46:58] that's one thing that I've noted with
[47:02] all my guests they are extremely humble
[47:05] they're extremely kind there's like
[47:08] obviously there's like in every
[47:09] community at least like a small portion
[47:12] uh of people that are not that uh but
[47:16] it's for me
[47:18] outstanding what how high the rate of
[47:21] humble and kind and loving and caring
[47:24] people in in Bitcoin are like it it's
[47:27] it's outstanding for me there like I my
[47:30] prime example for that is Jeff poof like
[47:33] he is probably the most humble and kind
[47:36] guy and additionally to that so
[47:39] successful and and and so uh good in
[47:43] life like he doesn't need to be humble
[47:46] like he can actually brag about his
[47:48] achievement but he chooses not to
[47:50] because he's humble and kind guy yeah
[47:52] and yeah yeah please just to cut in
[47:55] right here I'm sorry to cut your thought
[47:56] off but this is so important why is it
[47:59] like let's try to ask why why is it that
[48:01] so many bitcoiners are so humble and
[48:03] kind why is that I think it's because
[48:06] Bitcoin literally incentivizes
[48:08] cooperation whereas everything else in
[48:11] life incentivizes individualism let me
[48:13] explain at least for me when you go to
[48:16] school it's about Hey listen keep your
[48:18] eyes on your own paper okay keep your
[48:21] head down we literally had I don't know
[48:23] about you we had dividers you would
[48:25] literally take a like a cardboard
[48:26] divider and divide your desk so that no
[48:28] one else could see you or talk to you
[48:30] when it was time to work on homework or
[48:32] do tests or something like that and when
[48:34] you think about it yes you don't want
[48:36] people just cheating off someone else
[48:37] that doesn't help them to learn but
[48:39] imagine a classroom where you say okay
[48:41] listen the only way that everyone passes
[48:44] is if everyone understands the concepts
[48:46] that we're going over okay so work
[48:48] together everyone figure out how you're
[48:50] going to explain and understand and pass
[48:52] this test like what about a
[48:54] collaborative type of classroom you go
[48:56] to work it's like okay listen you're
[48:58] against everybody okay you're trying to
[49:00] step on these other guys so that you can
[49:01] climb the corporate ladder you know what
[49:03] I mean it's there's no cooperation in
[49:05] the workplace even though being
[49:06] collaborative is very important to
[49:08] succeeding even in business it's like I
[49:10] super Cut Throat okay I would literally
[49:12] the the CEO of McDonald's at one point
[49:14] he said if my competition was drowning I
[49:16] would stick a hose in their mouth you
[49:18] know what I mean like and I understand
[49:20] yeah business a little bit Cutthroat but
[49:22] imagine a world where everybody is
[49:24] collaborating right what about a world
[49:25] where everyone's working together all
[49:27] right instead of trying to undercut
[49:28] people and cut them down and pull them
[49:30] down right Bitcoin is about
[49:33] collaborating Bitcoin only works if you
[49:35] collaborate so I think that because the
[49:37] network because the math of Bitcoin is
[49:40] collaborative it makes the people
[49:42] collaborative as well that's what I
[49:45] think why do you think uh like is that
[49:49] because when I like if I make a bunch of
[49:53] money uh I save everything in Bitcoin
[49:56] and that's good for you also because you
[49:59] also saving Bitcoin is is that the
[50:01] reason why Bitcoin connects us and is
[50:04] kind of making us humble and making us
[50:07] collaborate with other people that might
[50:09] be one reason but the second reason I
[50:10] would say is because doing the opposite
[50:13] of that is not maybe not the opposite
[50:15] but like trying to attack the network is
[50:17] not incentivized so trying to be an
[50:20] individual is not incentivized so what I
[50:22] what I mean by that is if you're the
[50:24] type of person who's like you know what
[50:25] I'm going to use all my electricity in
[50:27] my house to try to guess Bitcoin wallets
[50:29] instead of working to mine a block and
[50:32] boosting the hash rate I'm just going to
[50:34] try to guess wallets all day and steal
[50:35] someone's Bitcoin uh that's why Bitcoin
[50:38] is so secure I have a video literally
[50:40] what are the odds of someone stealing
[50:41] your Bitcoin uh and it's it's 10 to the
[50:43] 77 and that might sound like it's not
[50:45] that big of a number there are only 10
[50:48] to the 80 atoms in the entire universe
[50:51] right so you guessing my wallet is you
[50:54] guessing the same atom that I picked
[50:56] pick right that's insane um so plus plus
[51:00] than a than a multi signature wet yes
[51:05] maybe have to cast free or something
[51:06] like that sorry like and that that's
[51:08] another thing that's just a normal
[51:09] wallet a multisig wallet you would never
[51:11] like it's not possible so when you're
[51:13] trying to attack the network you only
[51:15] get poorer if you try doing a 51% attack
[51:18] it's not possible the hash rate's too
[51:19] big you only get poorer you try to steal
[51:21] people's Bitcoin you only get poorer you
[51:23] never find anyone's Bitcoin you never
[51:25] find it it's not possible um when it
[51:27] comes to you trying to run evil nodes
[51:31] that like your nodes are trying to run a
[51:34] software that says no the the the
[51:36] Bitcoin Network actually is 41 million
[51:38] Bitcoin not 21 million no one's going to
[51:40] use your network you're wasting
[51:41] electricity you're just getting poorer
[51:44] uh basically if you're not working
[51:46] together with people you get poorer okay
[51:49] this is the wall of Bitcoin that secures
[51:51] a network this is you trying to
[51:52] penetrate it's not going to work you
[51:54] just get poorer and you look like an
[51:56] idiot everyone's going to make fun of
[51:58] you you know they're like look at this
[51:59] guy he's trying to like steal people's
[52:01] Bitcoins he's been trying to steal
[52:02] people's Bitcoin since 2009 he hasn't
[52:05] found a single one he's wasting
[52:07] electricity he's getting poorer if he
[52:09] was mining Bitcoin he probably would
[52:10] have got some by now you know what I
[52:12] mean um even mining pools mining pools
[52:15] are a collaborative effort it's everyone
[52:17] putting their electricity towards mining
[52:19] a block it's another form of cooperation
[52:21] everything about Bitcoin involves
[52:23] cooperating that's an amazing Insight
[52:25] that everything in Bitcoin is
[52:27] incentivized for you to join a network
[52:30] and not attack the network I love that a
[52:33] lot really cool uh before we come closer
[52:35] to the end um I want to ask you about
[52:39] the current situation of Bitcoin we have
[52:42] I feel like the the we kind of like the
[52:45] the starting of a maybe a major bull
[52:48] cycle maybe we the starting at like a a
[52:50] hill in front of us um how do you assess
[52:53] the the current situation with Bitcoins
[52:55] with corporate adoption even Nation de
[52:58] adoption from El Salvador uh what do you
[53:00] expect in in the coming months and uh
[53:03] years all right this is where we get
[53:04] into the the moon math as we call it
[53:07] right right now we're in oober um and
[53:09] right now we're kind of flat but you
[53:11] just have to give Bitcoin time everyone
[53:13] wants to rush it they want things to go
[53:15] on their time Bitcoin is going to go at
[53:17] its time okay not yours so you have to
[53:19] be humble and um me personally I think
[53:23] this is one of those moments where
[53:25] people will look back in history
[53:27] and be like they'll kick themselves
[53:28] they'll be like why why did I not you
[53:30] know because the 2025 Bull Run can
[53:34] change your life it really can change
[53:36] your life because what does change your
[53:38] life mean it's different for everyone
[53:39] but someone putting in $600 and then
[53:42] having 6,000 in a year you know what I
[53:45] mean a 10x that will change their life
[53:48] right um even a 2X change could change
[53:52] their situation for just a little bit it
[53:53] can make them a little bit happier it
[53:55] could take off a little a little bit of
[53:56] pressure uh and the reason why I say
[53:58] that there's no way that the adoption
[54:01] curve is going to in terms of like the
[54:04] rate of return the cumulative rate of
[54:07] return is not going down I don't buy
[54:08] that and the reason why is again only 3%
[54:11] of people are using Bitcoin in the world
[54:13] so how could the annual growth rate go
[54:16] down it has to go up exponentially
[54:19] because we we're not even at 50% you
[54:21] know um countries are not all mining
[54:24] Bitcoin only a very few mining Bitcoin
[54:27] the ETFs yeah it's a big deal but um
[54:30] imagine when companies start getting
[54:32] into imagine when Banks start getting
[54:34] into buying and holding Bitcoin what's
[54:37] going to happen you know what I mean so
[54:39] I think right now we're looking at a if
[54:43] you look at the Bitcoin chart and then
[54:44] you zoom in to all the times before it
[54:46] blew up it looked exactly like this
[54:48] right it looked exactly like what it
[54:49] looks like right now and people always
[54:52] think well dude it's not going to go up
[54:54] to it's not going to go up to $5 are you
[54:56] insane it's only 5 cents right now then
[54:59] later okay well it's not going to go up
[55:01] to $50 it's only5 $5 right now then a
[55:04] little bit later you know hey dude it's
[55:06] not going to go up to 500 it's only $50
[55:08] right now then 50,000 right now let's
[55:11] just call it 50,000 dude it can't go up
[55:14] to 500,000 are you crazy so I think
[55:17] that's a game that will continue to go
[55:19] on and on and on um but as long as it
[55:22] stays scarce and money keeps getting
[55:24] printed the only way for Bitcoin point
[55:26] to go is up and to the right absolutely
[55:29] uh really really cool um I have one more
[55:32] question for you why did you start uh
[55:35] advocating publicly for for Bitcoin you
[55:38] have your YouTube channel uh you have a
[55:40] Twitter account uh you're putting out
[55:42] videos you're putting your your your
[55:44] your face uh out there uh and you are as
[55:48] I call it a digital sold for for Bitcoin
[55:51] which I absolutely love and I appreciate
[55:54] uh do you spending your time in Bitcoin
[55:56] and advocating for it publicly and I
[55:58] encourage everyone to do it uh and I
[56:01] also encourage everyone who wants to do
[56:02] that like just like contact me send me a
[56:05] video of yourself uh if you if you want
[56:08] we can do a podcast I love to discover
[56:11] new people and yeah like but what's
[56:14] what's your reason why why did you not
[56:17] hide uh and just like accumulate Bitcoin
[56:19] and and hide away in in the shadow why
[56:22] did you put yourself out there yeah and
[56:24] I'm actually going to do um a video
[56:26] about this about why like it's okay to
[56:29] not want to Advocate right because some
[56:31] people there's going to come a point
[56:33] where you're going to have a lot of
[56:34] money you're going to have a lot of
[56:35] purchasing power and people might want
[56:37] to rob you honestly um if you're like
[56:40] super public about your Bitcoin um and
[56:43] that's something that I think all
[56:44] bitcoiners might have to face at some
[56:45] point um and you know it's not as big of
[56:49] a deal now but that's already happened
[56:50] many times there's actually a list of
[56:52] Bitcoin attacks that have happened to
[56:54] people where they try to get their keys
[56:55] from them them or whatever it is and um
[56:59] I think that just comes with the
[57:00] territory you know what I mean um and I
[57:04] think that it was really Bitcoin
[57:06] University that inspired me to want to
[57:08] make videos because his were so simple
[57:10] he doesn't make a bunch of editing or a
[57:12] bunch of whatever it's as basic as it
[57:14] gets and he is like a great Beacon of
[57:17] Education uh he he whether he realizes
[57:19] it or not he's a hero uh anybody who
[57:22] makes Bitcoin content like Robin you are
[57:23] literally a hero that is not an
[57:25] understatement uh you know what I mean
[57:27] and um it might seem like oh no that
[57:29] that's too much like don't say that I'm
[57:30] too humble but if you look back at this
[57:33] in the future people will be like wow
[57:35] that guy literally saved my life because
[57:38] had I not watched that podcast I
[57:40] probably would have never started my
[57:41] journey you know so if you could stop
[57:44] the people from in like Yar Germany you
[57:47] know World War II if you knew
[57:48] hyperinflation was coming and there was
[57:50] a way to like hey man I'm going to be
[57:52] able to save you so that you don't die
[57:53] of hunger you know you will have been a
[57:56] hero for those people so I think that
[57:58] that's what we are looking at right now
[58:00] uh it might sound crazy now but just
[58:03] give it a little bit of time I think it
[58:04] won't sound so crazy so I think that
[58:07] being a Bitcoin Advocate is about trying
[58:09] to help as many people as I can and
[58:11] because the world is full of so many
[58:12] scams and schemes it's easy to be like
[58:15] well that's a pyramid scheme of course
[58:16] this guy he has a lot of Bitcoin of
[58:17] course he's going to tell people to buy
[58:19] Bitcoin and get other people into it so
[58:20] that he can dump on them you there is
[58:23] nowhere to dump in terms of Bitcoin I
[58:25] don't sell it for anything there's
[58:27] nowhere for me to go when it comes to
[58:29] crypto like some random doggy meme coin
[58:32] yes I need you to buy the doggy coin so
[58:34] that I can sell and dump on you so you
[58:36] can get poorer I can get richer there's
[58:38] nowhere for me to go from Bitcoin it's
[58:40] Bitcoin and then there's nowhere else I
[58:41] can't sell it for anything else like
[58:43] there's nowhere else to go you know what
[58:45] I mean there's no there's nothing to
[58:46] dump it for why would I why would I you
[58:48] know it's just it takes time but yeah
[58:51] that's why absolutely that's it's so
[58:52] funny um when when someone comes to me
[58:56] like oh you're just advocating for
[58:58] people for Bitcoin because you want to
[59:00] bump the price and I'm like wow you
[59:03] think really highly of me that you think
[59:06] that I have the ability to move the
[59:08] Bitcoin price
[59:10] like h i i i don't think um like maybe e
[59:16] musk can move the Bitcoin price to a
[59:19] certain extent for a short amount of
[59:21] time at least in 2021 hit did um like
[59:25] like some someone like really high up
[59:27] the ladder if he um focuses and
[59:30] concentrate a lot of wealth he might be
[59:33] able in like a few weeks times move the
[59:35] price a little bit up or a little bit
[59:37] down a few percents but not a lot like
[59:40] there has to be a major inflow or
[59:43] outflow of Bitcoin to actually make a
[59:45] difference because that asset is a
[59:48] little bit bigger uh than you might
[59:50] think uh but it's way smaller than where
[59:53] where it really goes so I always take it
[59:55] as a compliment if someone tells me uh
[59:58] oh you just want to pump the Bitcoin
[59:59] price I'm like yeah thank you so
[60:02] much big dog big dog that's what I try
[60:05] to do yeah thank you so
[60:07] much um no obviously that's that's
[60:10] that's a completely BS like obviously I
[60:12] I'm uh I'm not in nowhere near the
[60:16] position that I can even like uh move
[60:19] the Bitcoin price 0.1% but it's it's uh
[60:22] it's a good point for for me really
[60:24] really cool I appreciate that and I
[60:26] appreciate you also being in the Bitcoin
[60:28] scene and advocating for it I think we
[60:30] need as many digital soldiers as
[60:32] possible but of course yeah everyone has
[60:34] the uh the choice and I respect it fully
[60:37] like I have already like a few people on
[60:40] that were on my podcast but with no face
[60:43] uh and no name uh they just like were
[60:45] Anonymous on with with their voice but
[60:47] even like they could uh change their
[60:50] voice like that's that's like uh super
[60:52] easy to do even over the internet I can
[60:54] literally do it with like one button
[60:55] click because I have like such a mixtape
[60:57] here so like it's really super easy to
[60:59] do um but yeah really cool I appreciate
[61:02] you uh coming on the
[61:04] show yeah no yeah go ahead go ahead
[61:07] sorry um um the I have an end routine
[61:11] where I always have two questions uh the
[61:13] one question is always the same for
[61:14] every guest and the other question is uh
[61:16] the the question from previous guest the
[61:18] one question that is always the same um
[61:21] is what can we learn from you besides uh
[61:24] Bitcoin okay uh really quick before I do
[61:27] this uh one other thing I want to say
[61:28] about publicly advocating for Bitcoin
[61:30] and people getting attacked for Bitcoin
[61:32] uh again Bitcoin incentivizes
[61:33] cooperation if you try to rob me from my
[61:36] Bitcoin you you literally can't I mean
[61:38] it's up to me to tell you the keys um
[61:41] it's the only thing that you can
[61:43] actually and I'm not advocating that you
[61:44] do this but it's the only thing that you
[61:46] can actually die for and take to the
[61:48] Grave if you have money and that come
[61:50] rob you uh Michael sailor uses this
[61:52] example they can still shoot you and
[61:53] take the money they can never get the
[61:57] Bitcoin if you just don't tell them so
[61:59] like it it makes people incentivized not
[62:02] to try to rob people you know I mean
[62:04] like it incentivizes people to just get
[62:06] Bitcoin and hold it and wait you know I
[62:08] mean we will probably live in a society
[62:10] that is extremely low crime you know
[62:13] because theft will not be incentivized
[62:15] there will be no reason to try to rob
[62:17] people or steal people's money uh
[62:19] because it won't be possible especially
[62:20] if you have multi signature it will
[62:22] literally be impossible to steal
[62:24] someone's money if they have a multisig
[62:25] even if they gave you the keys they
[62:27] could give you the keys and you wouldn't
[62:28] be able to take it because it's multi-
[62:30] it's not possible so it actually
[62:33] disincentivizes violence so I think it's
[62:35] not it's not dangerous to do what I'm
[62:37] doing um because there's no incentive to
[62:40] try to rob people truly incredible as
[62:43] for sorry about that but as for what we
[62:44] can learn in terms of from me um outside
[62:49] of
[62:50] Bitcoin um that a really good question I
[62:54] would say that um
[62:56] what you can learn is that you can do
[63:00] amazing stuff without needing a bunch of
[63:03] funding or backing or experience or
[63:06] whatever it is you know what I mean I um
[63:09] started on this Bitcoin journey and
[63:10] right now my Channel's super small uh my
[63:13] net worth is super small but um it's
[63:16] slowly been growing my confidence has
[63:18] grown my net worth has grown my ability
[63:20] to talk on camera has grown my ability
[63:23] to explain things has grown my
[63:25] understanding of economy and of the
[63:26] world and the politics has grown a huge
[63:28] amount and all I had to do was get
[63:31] focused and get on to a um like a
[63:36] routine of educating myself I guess what
[63:38] you can learn from me is you can learn
[63:40] anything you know what I mean you don't
[63:42] have to necessarily go in debt to do it
[63:44] now if you want to be a doctor or a
[63:45] certain type of engineer yeah I'd say go
[63:47] to school for sure but if you want to
[63:49] understand the world better and you want
[63:51] to increase your knowledge you can do
[63:53] that you live in the information age you
[63:54] have access to so much
[63:56] and it's just about telling yourself and
[63:58] understanding that you can do it too you
[64:00] know Robin has 10K subscribers I can I
[64:03] can have 10K you know like you can do
[64:05] what other people do you know you don't
[64:07] have to be someone special everybody's
[64:09] normal everybody's normal so that's what
[64:12] I'd say absolutely because uh I had zero
[64:16] subscribers just 11 months ago so it's
[64:20] literally like a really possible which
[64:22] shocks me honestly um which makes me
[64:24] really humble and grateful for for that
[64:27] uh but it goes to show you like if you
[64:28] really dedicate yourself to something uh
[64:30] it's it's really cool by the way
[64:32] congrats on your 100 subscribers I think
[64:34] it's an amazing accomplishment uh
[64:37] putting because you did the the most
[64:39] important step and you did the one step
[64:41] that most people fail this they never
[64:44] really start they maybe make a video
[64:47] maybe they do two videos or three videos
[64:49] but they never do more than that like
[64:51] they they stop at some point and if you
[64:54] just like keep going at it and if you
[64:56] just like keep going with with video and
[64:58] video and video uh people like you said
[65:03] before it's hard to ignore it's
[65:05] impossible to ignore someone with hard
[65:07] money H it's completely impossible to
[65:09] ignore someone that just keeps going
[65:11] with the action like it's just like it
[65:14] gets growing it's gets better H you get
[65:16] better and it's like um 100 subscriber I
[65:20] know how how how that feels and and it's
[65:24] like uh it's it's such an a huge first
[65:27] Milestone because you Pro prove to
[65:29] yourself like okay I can do that like I
[65:31] can do 100 then I can do 200 then I can
[65:34] get to a thousand if I can get to a
[65:36] thousand why not go to a million like
[65:37] that there's like no difference between
[65:39] gaining at the first 100 to a million
[65:42] it's just like doing it longer and
[65:43] getting better every day a little bit um
[65:46] and uh it's it's it's absolutely insane
[65:49] for me to be at 10,000 I still can't
[65:51] really believe it I still can't really
[65:54] like I still think like have 200
[65:55] subscribers or something like that I
[65:57] still have like this this I'm still
[65:59] afraid that this is just Bots or
[66:00] something like
[66:02] that but you know what I mean so huge
[66:04] congratulations for your uh F first
[66:07] efforts and for your first 100
[66:08] subscribers and I encourage everyone uh
[66:10] that is watching that uh that video go
[66:13] go to his account it's Chen C PTC I
[66:15] think it's the
[66:18] handle exactly it's it's even like um
[66:22] it's even rhyming a little bit I love it
[66:24] a lot and let Maybe let's pump it up to
[66:26] like 200 or 300 whatever because this
[66:28] video will come out in 200 uh let's
[66:31] let's see where we end up um yeah thank
[66:33] you so much uh for being on already I
[66:35] have one more question the question the
[66:37] from the previous guest uh so the
[66:39] previous guest is ask a question for the
[66:40] next guest without knowing who the next
[66:42] guest is unfortunately sorry Dylan
[66:45] declair he was the first the previous
[66:47] guest I forgot to ask him about his
[66:51] no like he was literally right now at my
[66:54] house because he's in Vienna we filmed
[66:56] the podcast in my apartment uh and I
[66:59] completely forgot um to ask him but I
[67:04] just made a question around the topic
[67:06] that we were discussing with Dylan so
[67:08] like the most likely question that would
[67:10] he would ask but I'm so sorry that that
[67:13] I forgot to ask him um he's so so kind
[67:16] to me that I completely forgot to ask
[67:19] him um I have the question from the
[67:23] topic of Dylan uh what do you expect in
[67:25] the coming next years in terms of
[67:28] corporate Bitcoin adoption because we
[67:31] talked with Dylan about like S&B 500 the
[67:34] the fby rule that will still come soon
[67:37] and kind of like this the starting point
[67:38] of that micro strategy Playbook being
[67:41] adopted by uh way more companies and by
[67:44] way bigger companies even yeah um in
[67:47] terms of Corporations uh not only will
[67:50] we see corporations adopting the Bitcoin
[67:52] the micro strategy strategy we're going
[67:54] to see individual ual more often than
[67:56] not adopting the micro strategy strategy
[67:58] so I'm going to be honest I'm doing the
[68:01] micro strategy trade right like I'm
[68:03] doing a speculative attack on the dollar
[68:05] so I actually took out loans uh some
[68:08] personal some credit card some from like
[68:10] my family or whatever and I am in debt
[68:13] to buy Bitcoin some people will say that
[68:16] is a horrible idea it's a terrible idea
[68:17] um I've completely already paid off the
[68:19] debt you know what I mean like that that
[68:20] is insane because I started this in
[68:22] 2023 um and Bitcoin goes up faster than
[68:26] your than your debt right so what people
[68:28] are going to do this is more doable for
[68:30] companies if you can borrow like micro
[68:32] strategy at 1% 2% and Bitcoin has a
[68:35] compound annual growth rate of 55% 60%
[68:39] even 20 okay let's say I'm wrong and the
[68:42] rate starts to go down 20% you're still
[68:44] making a guaranteed 18% just on the
[68:48] asset that you're holding that's not on
[68:50] top of your business's Revenue right so
[68:53] once we get more um Clarity in terms of
[68:57] banks being able to hold because that's
[68:59] probably the main thing holding people
[69:00] back like companies don't want to leave
[69:02] their money with coinbase right they
[69:04] want their money with banks that are too
[69:07] big to fail for being honest uh so
[69:10] they're going to want to have custodians
[69:12] that are institutional grade who have a
[69:15] large amount of liquidity a huge amount
[69:18] of assets under management and a long
[69:20] history of being custodians and holding
[69:22] on to huge amounts of mon AR value and
[69:27] we're going to see tech companies
[69:29] realize oh wait I can actually increase
[69:30] my profit margins by a huge amount just
[69:33] by having uh you know this thing on my
[69:36] balance sheet you know what I mean just
[69:38] by adding this to my Reserve or to my
[69:41] treasury I'm going to be increasing the
[69:43] market capitalization of my company by
[69:46] tenfold without having to do any extra
[69:48] work you're not doing anything extra
[69:50] like you are 10 Xing you are going to
[69:53] 10x your company by doing no extra work
[69:55] work absolutely amazing why would you
[69:57] not do it I think more people are going
[69:59] to be adopting this strategy individuals
[70:01] and corporations uh and that's going to
[70:03] be when we see like how can you expect
[70:06] the compound annual growth rate to go
[70:08] down when Dell Nvidia Apple all these
[70:11] Mega companies start adopting the mega
[70:13] companies aren't even here yet and you
[70:15] think that the compound interest rate is
[70:16] going to go down I don't see that
[70:18] happening I just can't see it happening
[70:19] I think we're going to explode upward
[70:21] it's going to be insane no one's going
[70:23] to be ready I tend towards that honestly
[70:25] I I try to be not completely excited
[70:28] about Bitcoin like because I'm too
[70:30] excited I think and I try to lower my
[70:33] excitement a little bit and be like
[70:35] realistic about it but I speak every
[70:37] time with a bitcoiner and every day with
[70:40] a bitcoiner and I cannot see Bitcoin not
[70:45] going parabolic up like it's really hard
[70:48] for me to imagine that we just like
[70:50] slowly gradually like I think it will go
[70:53] at some point like really parabolic uh
[70:55] and uh it's it's it's interesting for me
[70:58] how how how fast that actually could go
[71:02] but I I tried try to stay off the gas
[71:04] paddle and like oh yeah like I'm fine
[71:07] with it like let's go let's look at like
[71:10] adk next and maybe then let's to 90k but
[71:14] there could be that there could be that
[71:16] night or like you turn off your phone on
[71:18] Friday and maybe on like a Tuesday
[71:20] because you just like slept over and you
[71:23] had like a I don't know what retreat or
[71:25] like you turn off your phone for a few
[71:27] days all of the sudden the the price
[71:29] went up from like 90k to 210k like those
[71:34] Chumps are
[71:37] possible um and this will blow
[71:40] everyone's mind uh and I just try to
[71:44] stay calm I just try to to stay
[71:47] levelheaded no matter what the price
[71:49] does and just DCA all the way uh and uh
[71:52] get into this Bitcoin send this Bitcoin
[71:55] OG s even though I'm not an OG but I I
[71:58] see like when whenever I have a Bitcoin
[72:00] OG uh in my podcast and they're like
[72:03] since like 10 years in there they have
[72:05] this really calm like a yeah the price
[72:08] will do what it do like they don't have
[72:10] like this oh it will p and try to get
[72:13] adopt that that send of of there if you
[72:17] understand what I'm meaning yes no I
[72:18] completely understand um it's easy to
[72:21] kind of do again Moon Moon math Moon
[72:24] booy math but at the same time it's not
[72:26] it's not based on nothing it's not based
[72:28] on nothing that's the main thing
[72:30] absolutely and and I think it's it's
[72:32] actually will happen uh I think that
[72:34] it's just like easier uh to have low
[72:37] expectations and get those low
[72:38] expectations blown out in the future uh
[72:42] than the other way around so uh I I
[72:44] think we will um blow out every
[72:47] expectations and every model as sailor
[72:50] says every model will break uh maybe
[72:53] even his own model that he put on let's
[72:55] see about yeah that thank you so much uh
