[00:00] the S&P 500 it's like 490 of those
[00:03] companies are like zombie companies that
[00:05] are just loaded with debt those won't
[00:07] exist they'll be wiped out because
[00:09] Bitcoin is the free market people always
[00:11] say to me I can't afford Bitcoin it's
[00:12] not about affording it it's about
[00:14] transitioning before your dollar gets
[00:16] wiped out AI in a Bitcoin world makes
[00:19] the world a far better place whereas AI
[00:22] in a Fiat system makes it a dystopia if
[00:24] someone is printing that money they're
[00:26] stealing your energy information in time
[00:29] so Bitcoin puts that power back in your
[00:31] hands if you change the incentive
[00:33] structure you completely change the
[00:36] dichotomy of humanity at the end of the
[00:38] movie Neo touches agent Smith and agent
[00:41] Smith blows up and Neo thinks he's won
[00:43] so Wall Street touches Bitcoin they
[00:44] think they capture it and they think
[00:46] they've
[00:47] won how does AI influence Bitcoin and
[00:51] how and why did you choose like Bitcoin
[00:53] and eii this this interface as a
[00:56] field well for me personally uh about
[01:00] four years ago I I went through some
[01:02] health issues and I told myself hey I'm
[01:04] going to start walking five six miles
[01:06] every day but on my Walks Like My Brain
[01:09] needs to constantly keep moving so I
[01:12] just started absorbing books and content
[01:14] like you know every day I'd go through
[01:16] like you know three books and you know
[01:18] or all these podcasts like Peter
[01:20] McCormick and and and you know uh Jeff
[01:24] Booth has kind of been my North Star and
[01:27] he talks about the idea that
[01:30] AI in a Bitcoin
[01:33] world makes the world a far better place
[01:36] whereas AI in a Fiat system you know
[01:40] makes it a dystopia and that really
[01:43] fascinated me because he talks about
[01:46] Bitcoin being an honest Ledger because
[01:49] that's all that it is it's just an
[01:51] actual measurement of the world and if
[01:53] you were to have
[01:55] ai teamed with that actual measurement
[01:59] you know you have a more productive
[02:01] planet and you start seeing a world
[02:04] where maybe people work 15 hours a week
[02:06] and they start to think more e
[02:08] existentially you know you you think
[02:10] about like maso's hierarchy of needs
[02:12] talks about like you need your basic
[02:14] needs met first you know your physiology
[02:17] you know food shelter but what happens
[02:21] when you pass that and those needs are
[02:24] met you know because of the advancements
[02:26] of AI is you start moving up the ch of
[02:30] Consciousness and that's why Bitcoin is
[02:32] so fascinating on a deep level because
[02:35] you realize wait this is a Consciousness
[02:39] Revolution this is not just about money
[02:41] this is a whole mindset of changing like
[02:44] the incentive structure so when I
[02:47] realized you know Bitcoin and AI kind of
[02:50] go together hand in
[02:51] hand it it it kind of blew me away like
[02:54] I I was taken back and I realized it's
[02:56] like this one-way door that you can't
[02:57] unsee
[03:00] do do you think like uh when we put AI
[03:04] Robotics and Bitcoin all together that
[03:07] it kind of enables an abundant system
[03:10] where everybody actually can do what
[03:12] they love and what they like because the
[03:15] basic needs are are met with AI and
[03:18] Robotics because they're like getting
[03:20] better and better they can do human TK
[03:22] they can probably build houses and stuff
[03:24] like that do you think do you think that
[03:26] we come to that future where uh humans
[03:29] BAS can decide what they do with their
[03:31] time because basic needs are cared for
[03:34] by Ai and Robotics and there sound money
[03:38] system allows that also yeah I
[03:41] absolutely uh recently I was talking to
[03:44] someone I I was in a self-driving car
[03:46] maybe about six months ago with Luke BRS
[03:49] he's another bitcoiner and you know
[03:52] Phoenix here it's a test City for
[03:54] self-driving cars and I noticed when I
[03:57] talk to people about self-driving cars
[03:59] they have like this this standoff to
[04:02] it and they're like oh I don't know if I
[04:05] could get into something that I'm not
[04:07] you know I'm not Manning myself and I
[04:10] said well you have to look at it this
[04:11] way let's just say hypothetically 20,000
[04:14] people died on the road every day in a
[04:17] self-driving car if the data shows that
[04:20] 19,999 people die on the road you've
[04:23] already Justified having the
[04:24] self-driving car in the road cuz you've
[04:26] saved one life I said you also have to
[04:28] look at the defl AR aspect of this here
[04:31] you are you pay $3 to $35,000 for a car
[04:35] here in the States now you have to pay
[04:38] the interest which you probably end up
[04:39] paying more like 50 to 60 you know over
[04:42] over time because they're living off the
[04:44] interest if you have this world of a
[04:48] deflationary monetary system what if you
[04:51] lived in a world where maybe you paid
[04:53] $100 a month to have a self-driving car
[04:57] that you don't even own you just it
[04:59] comes to you whenever you want you go
[05:01] where you want whenever you want think
[05:03] about how much that deflates your cost
[05:06] of living because you don't need the
[05:08] insurance payments you don't need the
[05:10] the car payments and it it makes the
[05:14] grid a lot easier too because a lot of
[05:17] accidents are caused by by more you know
[05:20] by by humans and you know speeding or or
[05:23] not speeding enough the people are not
[05:26] realiz and this is just this is Just
[05:28] Cars we're talking about this is going
[05:30] to permeate along every aspect of human
[05:33] life and drive the cost down of
[05:35] everything I uh as you said this is also
[05:38] kind of like what what Jeff bu is
[05:40] talking about we have this natural
[05:43] deflationary system where everything is
[05:46] getting cheaper all the time but it's
[05:48] not deflationary because we are printing
[05:51] money the money that we are using we are
[05:53] printing so much of it that we bending
[05:55] this deflationary system all of the
[05:57] sudden to an inflationary system uh
[06:00] which is really really
[06:02] bad first uh and uh kind of like gets in
[06:07] a way of innovation um which is also an
[06:10] interesting uh field like how do you
[06:12] think or how did for you personally uh
[06:15] Bitcoin influence your view on financial
[06:18] and personal freedom like the the whole
[06:20] thing like uh being financially free
[06:23] being from a personal standpoint free
[06:25] how did Bitcoin influence that I think
[06:29] if any thing it made me think more about
[06:33] austerity than anything else I don't
[06:35] know if it did that for you it it's the
[06:37] idea that I don't want to just live for
[06:41] the now you know in a Fiat system you're
[06:43] living for the now like I I think it was
[06:44] Peter McCormick went down to Argentina
[06:47] and he said that people are just like
[06:49] rejig jiggering their finances every day
[06:53] to just pay bills because they're living
[06:54] for the now because it's hyperinflated
[06:56] but if you're living on a Bitcoin
[06:58] standard you you're thinking about the
[07:00] future because you're you're conserving
[07:02] energy because essentially when you work
[07:06] work equals Energy Information in time
[07:10] and if someone is printing that money
[07:12] they're stealing your energy information
[07:14] in time so Bitcoin puts that power back
[07:18] in your hands in the sense where you
[07:20] could preserve that energy that you
[07:24] worked you mentioned austerity I'm uh
[07:27] I'm not native English so what what's
[07:29] the word austerity so so basically
[07:32] austerity
[07:33] means you know there's there's less
[07:36] consumerism that you do it there's more
[07:39] savings essentially you know like I'm
[07:42] I'm not going out and buying things that
[07:45] I don't need and if you listen to a lot
[07:49] of like guys down the Bitcoin Rabbit
[07:51] Hole like Jeff boot he talks about in a
[07:53] Bitcoin world you don't have willy-nilly
[07:56] like spending
[07:59] you know by big corporations people are
[08:01] going to be
[08:03] more more prudent with their money in a
[08:06] on on a Bitcoin standard so you're going
[08:08] to see more efficiency in businesses
[08:11] instead of all these inefficient zombie
[08:13] companies that exist I think the S&P 500
[08:15] it's like 490 of those companies are
[08:18] like zombie companies that are just
[08:20] loaded with debt so I think that is
[08:25] where the austerity kicks in it is those
[08:29] exist they'll be wiped out because
[08:31] Bitcoin is the free
[08:33] market and this is such a beautiful
[08:35] thing because then we come to a point
[08:37] where uh we have a world for full of
[08:40] lower time preference full of higher
[08:42] savings rate where people want to use
[08:46] their things that they are buying for a
[08:48] long time uh they like oh let's fix it
[08:51] and not like replace the new iPhone
[08:53] every half a year let's let's just
[08:55] change the battery and use it like one
[08:57] two years more because when the money is
[09:01] all of the sudden appreciating value
[09:02] this actually does something in your
[09:04] brain and actually changes uh the way
[09:06] you think um this is a topic where and
[09:09] we talked about it before that uh a lot
[09:11] of bitcoiners like put something on
[09:14] their mind and think that all bitcoiners
[09:17] should think like that um do are you um
[09:20] are you the opinion that um Bitcoin will
[09:24] actually change society in a major
[09:27] way uh yes I was actually having this
[09:30] discussion with someone else the other
[09:32] day and I was saying that if you change
[09:36] the incentive structure because humans
[09:38] are very incentive based creatures you
[09:42] completely change the dichotomy of
[09:44] humanity so if you think about like the
[09:47] German
[09:48] hyperinflation you
[09:50] know it makes total sense that they
[09:53] would elect a Madman because they were
[09:56] desperate and their incentive structure
[09:59] to look to anyone for answers it you
[10:02] know made them desperate so when you're
[10:04] desperate you make more emotional
[10:06] decisions you know looking back like in
[10:09] hindsight we're like oh my God how could
[10:11] they do that but you have to think about
[10:12] what it was like to wheelbarrow you know
[10:15] loads of cash for a loaf of bread
[10:19] so people when you put people in that
[10:22] mindset of of comfort and they don't
[10:25] have to worry about things like I don't
[10:26] have to worry about my food and shelter
[10:29] there's 's this giant burden of relief
[10:31] that happens and as that happens you
[10:34] start to think more existentially about
[10:36] life you know like my relationships you
[10:38] know you you know things like that you
[10:40] know what what do I want to do with my
[10:42] time so that's why Bitcoin is kind of a
[10:45] mind virus in that sense is that it's an
[10:49] because it's an accurate measurement of
[10:50] the world it starts
[10:54] to open people's minds up to what's
[10:57] possible
[11:00] so
[11:02] basically Bitcoin or like when money is
[11:05] broken it has an impact on the people
[11:09] which will also have an impact for their
[11:12] capabilities of choosing a good leader
[11:14] for them uh for them like in politics um
[11:18] but this is like an an amazing examples
[11:21] when we look at uh Germany at that time
[11:25] frame but what if like in the next like
[11:27] couple of hundred years and we at the
[11:30] full
[11:31] Bitcoin uh time like there's like
[11:34] Bitcoin is the me uh the store of value
[11:37] the Min exchange to unitive account and
[11:38] we are this full Bitcoin standard now I
[11:41] got the word I forgot Bitcoin standard
[11:43] for a second and we are the full Bitcoin
[11:45] standard um what changes for politics do
[11:49] are we are we in this position where we
[11:52] can truly uh optional vote for for
[11:56] government services like some people say
[11:58] like government government will be like
[12:00] a service uh how do do we think we can
[12:03] get rid of like borders and and and
[12:06] those territorial thinking or is it like
[12:09] even more maybe uh with with uh more
[12:12] decentralization in in smaller States I
[12:14] mean it's like a hard hard question to
[12:16] ask but I'm I'm really curious uh whe
[12:19] what Bitcoin can do on a broader scale
[12:21] for society and political do you have a
[12:24] opinion on that I I I have a lot of
[12:27] thoughts on it I mean obviously like
[12:29] you know no one can predict the future
[12:32] so like let's like let's start off with
[12:34] that uh what I can talk about is the
[12:38] game theory of it and and I do see a
[12:40] world that can be possibly less
[12:42] borderless so if you look at the
[12:45] conflict in Ukraine right
[12:48] now you know we could talk about all
[12:51] these geopolitical reasons that it
[12:53] happens but it essentially happens
[12:55] because the United States is extending
[12:59] dollar hemony Far East so Russia invades
[13:04] Ukraine and the United States says oh no
[13:08] we're you're in you're invading an
[13:10] independent nation we're going to shut
[13:12] you off the Swift system Russia turns
[13:14] around and says we don't care about your
[13:17] paper money we have oil that we Supply
[13:20] to Europe we'll shut Europe off or or
[13:23] make the prices of oil and gas more
[13:26] expensive in Europe which I'm sure
[13:28] you're experiencing now so this all is
[13:32] Game Theory so when you have a monetary
[13:35] system that's Universal
[13:37] worldwide these conflicts like this you
[13:40] know I'm not going to say that they they
[13:42] won't happen you know you know the
[13:44] things that in the Middle East you know
[13:45] they they seem to stem back from like
[13:47] ideologies like 2,000 years but it'll
[13:50] minimize them you know like I don't like
[13:52] to speak in like black and white terms
[13:54] like I'm a very gray area type person so
[13:57] I definitely think there's a
[13:59] minimization of it it it's kind of like
[14:01] like you eat healthy you have less of a
[14:03] risk of cancer you could still get
[14:05] cancer like but you have less of a risk
[14:08] of it it I that's how I see it with
[14:10] Bitcoin is that you're playing the
[14:12] mathematical probabilities and if you
[14:15] have these places that are self
[14:18] Sovereign and you have a world with AI
[14:22] That's pumping out resources it does
[14:25] kind of make it borderless because one
[14:26] of the reasons we have border borders is
[14:29] are resources you know we don't have
[14:31] enough resources to to deal with
[14:33] immigration or or but if you have a
[14:36] world of infinite energy especially once
[14:39] you go down the Bitcoin energy rabbit
[14:41] hole and you realize what that does for
[14:42] the energy industry now you're you're
[14:45] really into a realm of we we've passed
[14:48] these generic
[14:51] conflicts so like I I do look at it as
[14:55] it is it is definitely something that
[14:59] is the next phase of the cesf scale are
[15:01] you are you familiar with the cesf scale
[15:04] no no not at all so so you should look
[15:07] this side uh the Carter Chef scale
[15:09] there's basically like four types of
[15:12] civilizations and we're like a type0
[15:14] point7 we're not even a type one
[15:17] civilization and so like you know type
[15:20] one is kind of like it produces its own
[15:22] energy you know and then you get to like
[15:25] the whole Star Wars ideology is like a
[15:27] type two or type three civilization
[15:30] and Bitcoin is the first move to a type
[15:34] one civilization it's it's moving us in
[15:37] a direction of producing energy at an
[15:42] exponential rate
[15:44] and when when you produce energy because
[15:47] energy is all that matters it's not
[15:49] money or anything else because it's the
[15:51] energy that backs all this you know the
[15:53] work energy or the energy from the Earth
[15:55] or the energy from the Sun this is
[15:58] really what matters so when you're when
[16:00] you're extrapolating that on an
[16:02] exponential basis the sky's the limit
[16:05] you know like you know you're not just
[16:07] going to the Moon you know like maybe
[16:10] you know you could travel to another
[16:11] galaxy like like like you're you're
[16:14] breaking barriers that we thought would
[16:16] never be broken before once you break
[16:18] the energy
[16:20] idea yeah that's it's fascina I actually
[16:23] heard about that I didn't not knew about
[16:24] the name I heard about like type zero
[16:26] and type one Civ civilization think it
[16:29] was like really early on even like when
[16:31] I um learned about Bitcoin like three
[16:34] three four years ago um you mentioned
[16:37] that Bitcoin or like the rabbit hole
[16:39] around what Bitcoin will do for the
[16:41] energy system for the energy prod
[16:44] producers um more and more Bitcoin
[16:47] guests are mentioning Bitcoin and energy
[16:50] Bitcoin mining uh and what it will do
[16:52] for the energy I still don't have a full
[16:56] grip on that what what do you think will
[16:59] Bitcoin do for the Energy System what do
[17:01] you think like will be the impact of
[17:03] Bitcoin in the energy section so when we
[17:07] talk about energy the first thing that
[17:09] we have to understand like because
[17:11] everything comes down to First
[17:12] principles so you have to understand the
[17:14] laws of th thermodynamics energy can't
[17:17] be created and it can't be destroyed it
[17:20] can only be transferred all right so
[17:22] this is something that we know so this
[17:24] idea that we use energy H like it's it's
[17:28] not quite that
[17:30] simple it's a use it or lose it type
[17:33] situation because there's tons of
[17:35] stranded energy out there if you if you
[17:37] look into like energy companies they
[17:39] like sell their excess energy because
[17:42] there's there's there's too much so what
[17:45] Bitcoin is doing is it's the first tool
[17:49] that is taking all this stranded energy
[17:52] and it's utilizing it in an efficient
[17:56] fashion and it's stabilizing grids
[17:59] especially if you look at some of the
[18:00] work that's done in Africa like you know
[18:03] it I don't know if you've listened to
[18:04] any of Alex glad scene you know they
[18:07] they talk a lot about how there's kids
[18:09] in Africa who have no lights there's
[18:11] constant blackouts and Bitcoin mining is
[18:14] now giving them a grid because there is
[18:18] no grid there you know like you know we
[18:19] here in the United States we have an
[18:21] established grid they're in a position
[18:24] where they can start their grid from
[18:26] scratch with Bitcoin with a more
[18:28] efficient system and that is a
[18:33] amazing concept to think about because
[18:36] the incentive structure of
[18:38] Bitcoin Bitcoin mining is a is a
[18:41] Cutthroat business and its incentive is
[18:45] to find cheap lowcost energy so this
[18:48] idea of like you can mine it from your
[18:50] home those days are over they it always
[18:53] has to find cheap renewable energy so
[18:56] you're going to see it move toward
[18:58] places like you know volcanoes and
[19:01] methane landfills if you've ever had
[19:03] Daniel baton on they talk about how
[19:05] Bitcoin is the only thing that's eating
[19:07] the methane like a dung beetle which is
[19:10] unbelievable like methane causes more
[19:13] climate change than anything out there
[19:15] and there is something out there that
[19:16] will eat the methane that blows me away
[19:20] so like you've almost like Bitcoin is
[19:22] this Silver Bullet in the energy world
[19:25] that everyone has been looking for and
[19:27] they just don't know it yet
[19:30] it's it's it's fascinating see Al Al a
[19:32] real chance for the energy producers
[19:34] when they have this stranded energy or
[19:36] wasted energy that they actually have to
[19:39] pay for to get it somewhere because they
[19:42] cannot use it they cannot store it so
[19:43] they have to pay for to get it away if
[19:46] they don't have to pay for that but
[19:48] actually get money with Bitcoin miner
[19:50] it's like fascinating I had Lisa H Lisa
[19:54] Huff on on my podcast and she talked
[19:56] about that concept for like an hour and
[19:59] I was like let's let's talk three more
[20:01] hours about that because it's
[20:02] fascinating for me um yeah but we also
[20:05] talked about um Global Game Theory which
[20:07] is really interesting for me and then I
[20:10] think you even commented on one of my
[20:12] posts where I talked about the the grro
[20:15] ecosystem in in Africa uh and this is
[20:18] this is something that I see more and
[20:20] more where we have the western
[20:22] civilization that's kind of well not
[20:25] everybody of course but uh the majority
[20:28] of people are too arrogant to understand
[20:30] Bitcoin they're saying I don't need
[20:32] Bitcoin it's like a luxury item but when
[20:36] you look to Africa they actually use
[20:38] Bitcoin like they they actually need
[20:40] Bitcoin dayto day uh and the ecosystem
[20:43] is really growing and that's why for
[20:45] example Nigeria has the highest adoption
[20:47] rate of of uh of the Bitcoin uh even
[20:51] bigger than El Salvador even though in
[20:53] Salvador the president is is pushing it
[20:55] but still uh Nigeria has a higher adop
[20:58] rate um what what are your thoughts on
[21:01] like the global Game Theory we talked
[21:02] also before a little bit on on the the
[21:05] country and and and what it does to
[21:07] politics but what does it do to Game
[21:09] Theory and empowering uh countries like
[21:13] Africa like Salvador like Budan ah had
[21:18] uh the presidential candidate of Surinam
[21:20] also on the Maya so like all those
[21:22] countries that are not on the map yet
[21:25] but actually have a big Advantage down
[21:27] the road if because they jump directly
[21:29] to
[21:30] bitcoin well a lot of places have been
[21:34] colonized whether it be by you know the
[21:37] United States or France you know like a
[21:39] Africa has a a huge history of being
[21:44] colonized by France and they essentially
[21:47] pillage their resources you know and you
[21:49] know in the United States's case they
[21:51] they put puppet dictators in like it's
[21:54] it's a giant mess
[21:57] so what you're doing is with Bitcoin is
[22:00] you're making them self- Sovereign
[22:02] Nations because Africa has more
[22:05] resources than arguably any continent
[22:07] out there have you ever seen Black
[22:10] Panther the Marvel
[22:12] movie if you ever seen this movie the
[22:15] the idea is that Waka is supposed to be
[22:18] what Africa would have looked like
[22:20] without colonization it it'd be this
[22:23] this Utopia of resources and I kind of
[22:27] think that that's the road that Africa
[22:29] will go down over the next 20 to 50
[22:32] years is you're going to see them become
[22:34] become more self- Sovereign more
[22:36] independent there's going to be more
[22:40] stabilization because you're going to
[22:43] break the dollar hemony and the euro
[22:45] hemony in those systems because they now
[22:48] have an exit that they didn't have so
[22:51] you know you know you had Maya on
[22:53] recently and the same things go on in
[22:55] South America you know so I don't see
[22:58] why
[22:59] it makes total sense that South America
[23:02] and Africa are adopting this first
[23:04] because they're the most affected by the
[23:05] United States money printer so one of my
[23:09] game theories you know everyone always
[23:11] asks me oh when is this going to happen
[23:13] like like you you you can't predict the
[23:15] end of the dollar you know Jeff boot
[23:17] says like this could go on for a long
[23:19] time but if you wanted to know like a
[23:22] trigger moment that could really do it
[23:25] it's the moment that everyone starts
[23:27] selling US Treasury bonds so I don't
[23:30] know if if you've seen recently the
[23:31] United States bailed out
[23:33] Japan because if Japan sold their
[23:37] treasury bonds to get liquidity because
[23:39] they're the largest holder of United
[23:40] States Treasury bonds if they sold their
[23:42] treasury bonds to get liquidity that
[23:43] would really hurt the United States so
[23:47] the moment that these countries kind of
[23:49] dump the bonds on the market that's when
[23:52] the United States is going to reach a
[23:54] moment where all of their power
[23:57] dissipates the way it did in Rome you
[23:59] know thousands of years ago and then you
[24:02] just see an inflationary cycle that hits
[24:04] the United States so if anyone like ask
[24:07] like what could be the big trigger event
[24:10] that could do it I think that would do
[24:11] it but I think they'll do everything
[24:14] they can to not have those bonds come
[24:16] out on the market if you are listening
[24:18] to this podcast you might be wondering
[24:20] what is actually the setup look like of
[24:22] Robin or how can I improve my Bitcoin
[24:25] setup and there's two things you have to
[24:27] buy Bitcoin from the right source and
[24:29] you have to store Bitcoin the right way
[24:31] let's focus on the first thing how to
[24:33] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[24:36] only exchange don't deal with the
[24:38] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[24:39] exchange that has an own token or
[24:41] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[24:44] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[24:47] for me the best partner for that and now
[24:50] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[24:52] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[24:54] a self custody solution where you your
[24:58] self hold your keys and it should be a
[25:01] cold wallet so that's my Simple
[25:04] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[25:06] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[25:09] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[25:13] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[25:15] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[25:18] have one last thing before we get back
[25:20] to the video I'm really passionate about
[25:22] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[25:25] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[25:28] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[25:31] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[25:34] conference in whole of Europe for all
[25:36] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[25:38] this place in June for all europees it's
[25:41] a must go anyways you are so close to
[25:44] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[25:46] have to come I will do interviews there
[25:48] and I would love to meet you all there
[25:51] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[25:54] get discounts and use the links down in
[25:56] the description I mean when when we look
[25:59] at the broader scale of of of the world
[26:02] uh nobody trusts each other like Russia
[26:04] does not trust uh China China doesn't
[26:07] trust America like all all the states
[26:09] they don't trust each other so it's just
[26:12] natural over time that even on Country
[26:15] level like on a really big scale they
[26:17] will adopt something that they don't
[26:20] have to trust because they know this
[26:23] Bitcoin thing is not manipulated by
[26:25] anything uh there's also gold like the
[26:28] bricks like kind of like get in this
[26:31] direction but they will figure out that
[26:33] gold is is not working as as good as
[26:36] Bitcoin uh it gold already was a
[26:39] standard and we came off of that like
[26:41] there's there's a reason why it failed
[26:43] it's just not uh really good in a in a
[26:45] global digitalized world that's why we
[26:47] have Bitcoin um but the question before
[26:51] that I wanted to ask is um does it make
[26:54] sense now on an individual level uh or
[26:57] when does it make sense for you to
[27:00] switch the country from one of the
[27:03] western maybe on the on the downside
[27:06] falling uh side if this plays out like
[27:09] you said like the Africa is kind of
[27:11] going to this Utopia because they have
[27:13] so much natural resources they had in
[27:15] the Bitcoin adoption uh Europe is
[27:18] regulating it like crazy they seemingly
[27:21] don't get it Bitcoin de now uh America
[27:25] is kind of open but there's also
[27:27] Elizabeth War and shamie D in there so
[27:30] interesting country for me um does it
[27:33] make sense or when does it make sense in
[27:35] your opinion to get out of the country
[27:37] and maybe move to a Bitcoin friendly
[27:40] country like El Salvador like another
[27:42] country I I don't know they you know
[27:45] that's a topic you you recently had a
[27:46] guest on I forgot who what his name was
[27:49] but his attitude was kind of like no
[27:52] stay and make your country a Bitcoin
[27:54] country like don't flee and and I kind
[27:57] of have that me ality too I I think the
[28:00] game theory plays out globally you know
[28:03] like the ethos of the United States is
[28:07] very independent and because it operates
[28:11] through state laws it's a lot harder
[28:16] to get through Draconian
[28:20] legislation
[28:22] because if you know anything about
[28:24] marijuana in the United States all right
[28:27] so mariju still has a federal ban all
[28:30] right but the states have kind of said f
[28:32] you to that and you know they don't
[28:36] apply it and then the states make it
[28:38] legal and now people go around and buy
[28:40] things in dispensaries so when the fed
[28:44] and the states ban something together
[28:47] the FED uses the state resources to
[28:50] enforce the ban but if the FED bans
[28:52] something and the state doesn't ban
[28:54] something the FED now has to come in and
[28:56] use their own resources and it becomes
[28:59] logistically
[29:00] impossible for them to do this so
[29:03] there's kind of like like in the case of
[29:05] marijuana like yeah there's a federal
[29:08] ban on it but nobody's enforcing this
[29:10] because the states have like you know
[29:12] rationally figured out I kind of think
[29:14] that that might be the path for Bitcoin
[29:16] you know if you've ever listened to
[29:18] Dennis Porter you know he talks a lot
[29:20] about this because he deals with like
[29:22] the legislation in Washington for for
[29:25] Bitcoin and in that sense I don't think
[29:30] the United States is going to be as
[29:32] Draconian as a lot of Bitcoin bitcoiners
[29:36] think you know that oh I have to run to
[29:38] Al
[29:39] Salvador but at the same time the United
[29:42] States is going to fight to keep the
[29:44] dollar and power it's just like that's
[29:46] also part of the game theory so at some
[29:48] point they're going to have to have this
[29:50] realization of when do we give up this
[29:53] quest to save the country or or when do
[29:56] we just start stacking Bitcoin just in
[29:59] case and if you think about people like
[30:01] Jason Lowry who are like working with
[30:04] the government to explain to them the
[30:06] game theory this at some point they have
[30:08] to get this like you know they may not
[30:11] want to openly come out and say this but
[30:14] it just becomes rational at some point
[30:16] that you know if you're standing on a
[30:17] train track and the train is heading
[30:19] toward you you just simply jump out the
[30:21] way and the United States is going to be
[30:23] in that position so you know I guess it
[30:26] depends what country you're in
[30:29] like it's all caseby case basis but I
[30:32] don't think the Western
[30:34] countries are going to fight this as
[30:38] much as maybe Russia would fight it
[30:41] because they're more an insulated type
[30:45] economy yeah it by the way it was Mike
[30:48] hobbert so also like as you
[30:52] Mike uh first name the same um yeah it's
[30:57] it's it's it's uh
[30:58] I'm also like kind of like I want to
[31:01] fight in the region for Bitcoin to be
[31:06] accepted and be uh really good hold and
[31:09] fascinating enough the German speaking
[31:12] area is really strong with Bitcoin
[31:15] content uh this was one major reason why
[31:18] I decided to to keep it English because
[31:20] I like my my girlfriend speaks English
[31:22] with me like my my my world is a little
[31:24] bit English even though I'm in a German
[31:26] speaking country and I feel more
[31:29] comfortable with English than I feel I
[31:31] feel with the high standard of German
[31:34] like there's a Austrian version of
[31:36] German that's obviously my most
[31:38] comfortable language but that so that if
[31:41] I have to speak like uh so that the
[31:44] Germans also understand me have to speak
[31:45] a little bit differently uh so it's like
[31:48] the Arnold schwarzer Austrian I speak uh
[31:52] and uh because the
[31:55] German um the Germans have a really
[31:58] strong Community like they are really
[32:00] great and big uh content creators and I
[32:03] was like I I don't need to have another
[32:07] Bitcoin podcast in there so I can freely
[32:09] choose between German and English and
[32:11] it's like the easiest decision um let's
[32:15] switch a little bit gear you also um are
[32:19] were the the general manager of Team 23
[32:22] you sent me sent me this you there
[32:26] something like what what was that about
[32:29] so so uh
[32:32] ESPN they're not on ESPN anymore they
[32:35] they have been for like the last seven
[32:36] eight years they're actually moving to
[32:38] like uh Fox Sports so there's there's an
[32:41] event a basketball tournament where
[32:44] teams compete for a million dollars and
[32:48] basically they're like former Pros or
[32:50] guys that kind of you know belong in the
[32:52] NBA but aren't in the NBA or former
[32:55] college teams so I happened to put
[33:00] together uh one of the teams in this
[33:03] event and we were a two-time finalist
[33:07] and then we merged with another team
[33:09] called heartfire and heartfire ended up
[33:12] winning the money last year so uh it
[33:17] kind of you know it just kind of
[33:18] materialized into this thing and I
[33:20] remember they would always at uh believe
[33:23] it or not two years ago they had an
[33:25] amazing contest if you fill out a
[33:28] bracket and whoever had the most points
[33:30] on the bracket got a cash equivalent to
[33:33] whatever the price of one Bitcoin was at
[33:37] the time that the tournament ended and
[33:40] at the time I think it was about $38
[33:45] $39,000 so like like someone won $38,000
[33:49] off this and and I remember I was
[33:51] talking to someone I was like you guys
[33:52] got to find a way to incorporate Bitcoin
[33:54] more but I I don't think they went
[33:55] deeper down that rabbit hole so like for
[33:59] me like doing the event the like you
[34:02] know over the last five years has been
[34:04] more about
[34:06] like you know trying to win extra money
[34:10] to buy Bitcoin like if you want me to be
[34:13] honest with you but but now that I've
[34:14] kind of like discovered Bitcoin and I've
[34:16] gone down this Rabbit Hole you know like
[34:19] basketball has kind of take like this
[34:21] secondary thing to me you know like I
[34:24] cuz I feel like I've exited the Matrix a
[34:26] little that this is is something you
[34:28] can't unsee and you know I've kind of
[34:30] put basketball in the back
[34:32] burner it's it's fascinating I hear also
[34:35] the the the comparison between Fiat
[34:38] system is the Matrix uh and Bon kind of
[34:41] the Escape you also see it like
[34:44] that I do I do and I I think the Matrix
[34:47] is one of the best analogies whichever
[34:49] bitcoiner came up with that is so
[34:51] brilliant and one of the reasons I think
[34:54] so is if you remember the movie
[34:58] Morpheus couldn't just show Neo The
[35:00] Matrix he had to give him the choice to
[35:03] take the pill because if you showed it
[35:06] to him just straight out it' probably be
[35:09] too much of a shock on his brain so he
[35:12] had to understand first that he was
[35:15] willing to see or willing to to to
[35:19] possibly be open that something is off
[35:23] so he gave him the choice of the pills
[35:25] that's why I love the orange pill
[35:26] analogy in Bitcoin because if I have
[35:29] this conversation with someone who's not
[35:31] ready I'm essentially unplugging them
[35:34] from the Matrix and the shock of that is
[35:36] too great on them so it it is something
[35:40] you have to see if someone is ready to
[35:43] have this conversation so the orange
[35:46] pill is that bridge of like are you
[35:48] ready to have this conversation with me
[35:50] you know like I could pick at it a
[35:52] little but you have to take the pill you
[35:54] have to swallow the pill once you
[35:56] swallow it me and you can can talk we
[35:58] can go deep down this rabbit hole but
[36:00] until you've taken that pill it I cannot
[36:03] have this discussion with you like it
[36:05] just you're not ready and and that's why
[36:09] I just think the Matrix analogy is so
[36:10] poignant you know I don't know if you
[36:12] feel that way when you talk to people
[36:13] but I feel that way it's it's definitely
[36:16] like that and when you when you speak
[36:18] with people that are fully integrated in
[36:21] the feeld system uh they are the opinion
[36:26] that uh inflation is good they are the
[36:29] opinion that uh it is all shaking out
[36:32] somehow and inflation is just temporary
[36:36] uh we need a centralized organization to
[36:38] control our money uh it's bad for an
[36:41] environment like there there all this
[36:42] like things that come up they are seeing
[36:46] in the the mainstream news they're
[36:48] seeing that and they're like taking that
[36:50] in in in account but they're not really
[36:52] diving deep uh and you can you can see
[36:56] after you speak with someone like 5 10
[36:59] 20 minutes um is that someone that
[37:02] actually does deep research or is he too
[37:06] much caught up in that whole fear race
[37:09] in this whole uh like oh I have toay and
[37:12] and I have a lot of empathy for those um
[37:15] I know a lot of in in in in in in my
[37:18] environment where like they they have to
[37:20] struggle a lot they work a lot and they
[37:23] they don't have the time to to just sit
[37:25] down relax take take a book and and read
[37:29] like five six Bitcoin books in a week
[37:32] because this is a luxury like uh having
[37:35] the time to to relax and and and study
[37:38] and I now take really consciously at
[37:40] least one hour a day to read a book like
[37:44] that's like right now like at least one
[37:47] hour that's like the minimum I have to
[37:49] have every day it does not even has to
[37:51] be about Bitcoin doesn't even have to be
[37:53] about personal branding it has to be
[37:55] about something that is something like
[37:58] it has to be just something that I learn
[38:00] it has to be something new and that's
[38:04] that's that's the main thing for me like
[38:07] we always have to be aware that people
[38:08] are not ready for as you said for for
[38:11] bit Bitcoin and uh when they're ready
[38:13] they will come yeah I I love your
[38:16] approach and I love that you said you
[38:18] have empathy for them that's like super
[38:20] important to me you know uh Jeff boot
[38:22] says he he always reminds people
[38:25] remember you were in their position to
[38:27] you didn't know about this and now that
[38:29] you know you can't act like you've
[38:31] always known so you have to look at them
[38:34] as if they were you at some point so I
[38:38] always try to approach this very
[38:41] empathetically you know and I never
[38:43] attack anyone or or like go down that
[38:45] road because you just don't get results
[38:48] that way when you you know when you meet
[38:50] people where they are it's it's a whole
[38:52] different conversation you know with one
[38:54] of my really good friends I I love her
[38:56] so dearly she always says to
[38:59] me PE she always says people need now
[39:02] Solutions all right you know
[39:05] and I find like I love her so much and I
[39:10] don't know how to communicate to her
[39:13] that this is the now solution there is
[39:15] no politically now solution because the
[39:18] system is completely
[39:20] insolvent this is the now solution is to
[39:22] slowly start integrating yourself into
[39:25] this but it's really hard hard because
[39:28] people want instant relief and you know
[39:32] what do I say to that person you know
[39:34] like if if this instant relief doesn't
[39:38] exist how you know and and and I believe
[39:42] and someone believes that it does how do
[39:45] I you
[39:46] know talk to someone who believes that
[39:50] so like I always find like I I go
[39:52] through these I'm not going to say
[39:54] battles but I go through these things
[39:56] where I really care about certain
[39:58] people and I don't want them to get
[40:01] eaten by this Fiat
[40:03] system and I feel like the more that
[40:07] they shout at it like Jeff boot says the
[40:09] worse it's going to get and instead of
[40:12] just taking your time and energy and and
[40:14] moving it over you know buy some Bitcoin
[40:18] even if you can't afford it $5 $10 you
[40:20] know like people always say to me I
[40:22] can't afford
[40:24] Bitcoin it's it's not about affording it
[40:26] it's about transitioning before your
[40:28] dollar gets wiped out you're not going
[40:30] to be able to afford Fiat eventually
[40:32] anyway so what's your choice here to be
[40:36] hyperinflated out of the Fiat or to
[40:38] slowly take some of that Fiat and move
[40:40] it to something that actually stores
[40:42] value So when you say you can't afford
[40:45] Bitcoin I understand you may not be able
[40:47] to afford $65,000 for one but you can
[40:52] slowly transition over you know before
[40:56] this exit closes so I don't know like it
[40:59] that's that's one of the things I have
[41:01] like the biggest trouble with with
[41:03] people is to let them know like hey this
[41:06] exit door is open right now and you can
[41:10] slowly exit but it's going to take
[41:12] effort on your
[41:14] part
[41:16] and I feel like this with the now
[41:19] solution is also really interesting
[41:20] because I think about it that a lot
[41:23] um we I talked with uh two or three of
[41:26] my gu about that um when the Titanic
[41:30] ship sinks and the live rack the life
[41:33] boat is coming um you don't want the
[41:37] tianic to syn fast you want it to syn
[41:40] slow so that people have enough time to
[41:43] get on the lifeboats and get into safety
[41:46] um and I like that analogy a lot with
[41:49] the fat system because there would be a
[41:52] lot of damage done I feel like if the
[41:54] field system actually collapses this
[41:57] year and it's it's not impossible it's
[42:00] not impossible honestly uh but I would
[42:03] not wish for that like when we talk with
[42:05] bitcoiners like oh the Fiat system that
[42:08] and that are you really wishing for the
[42:10] Fiat system to collapse like the next
[42:12] two
[42:13] years it's extremely selfless uh selfish
[42:16] Robin to be honest with you like while
[42:17] me and you will become millionaires
[42:19] it'll be at the expense of the rest of
[42:21] the world and I don't want to be rich at
[42:24] the expense of the rest of the world I
[42:25] want a rising tide all boat situation
[42:29] and I love your Titanic analogy I use
[42:31] that one all the time because it did
[42:32] take the Titanic 4 hours to sink you
[42:35] know most people don't know that four
[42:37] hours to sink and just think about it
[42:40] four hours and they still couldn't get
[42:42] enough people on the the
[42:44] Lifeboat I
[42:47] don't that's something that kind of
[42:49] keeps me up at night and I'm glad that
[42:50] you brought it up is how does this
[42:54] transition look you know we we talked
[42:57] about the Matrix and you know a lot of
[43:01] there's a lot of talk right now about
[43:03] the Bitcoin ETFs right oh the ETFs are
[43:06] going to capture Bitcoin and I kind of
[43:09] chuckle at this because it's like all
[43:12] right you guys understand the Matrix why
[43:14] don't you go deeper in that analogy so
[43:17] let's just say Wall Street is Neo and
[43:21] Bitcoin is Agent Smith so at the end of
[43:23] the movie Neo touches agent Smith and
[43:26] agent Smith blows up and Neo thinks he's
[43:29] won all right so Wall Street touches
[43:31] Bitcoin they they they think they
[43:33] capture it and they think they've won so
[43:36] if you remember the next two
[43:38] movies by blowing up agent Smith he
[43:41] freed him from the system and now agent
[43:44] Smith became a virus all right and
[43:47] that's what Bitcoin is it's a virus
[43:50] because once these hedge funds and once
[43:53] these companies hold 5% 3% of their
[43:58] portfolio in Bitcoin and if they tried
[44:00] to play leverage games with it guess
[44:03] what now the government's got to bail
[44:05] out the Bitcoin ETFs because that's
[44:08] now it's it's it's it's a poison pill
[44:11] for their system so Bitcoin becomes so
[44:14] big that it assimilates to the system
[44:17] like a virus even though it's more like
[44:19] an antidote we know this but like a
[44:22] virus it assimilates so then it puts the
[44:25] United States government in a position
[44:26] where
[44:27] what if there's 10 trillion in Bitcoin
[44:31] and someone tries to play leverage games
[44:33] they're going to have to bail that out
[44:35] because it would almost be like a
[44:37] housing crisis type situation in ' 08 so
[44:40] this is where the game theory really
[44:42] takes place because if everyone's
[44:44] Pension funds have Bitcoin
[44:47] allocation I think that really changes
[44:50] the ethos of all this so I don't see
[44:52] this as Wall Street can capture Bitcoin
[44:55] I mean how many Bitcoin could they
[44:57] possibly own I mean you know even if
[44:59] they were to own two million of them one
[45:03] what would that do for the price two
[45:06] you'd essentially be S assuming that
[45:08] they they stored it properly which is a
[45:10] whole another conversation you'd be
[45:12] saving tons of people's Pension funds
[45:15] because they would have exposure to the
[45:16] asset so like I think people look at
[45:19] this whole thing with the ETFs all wrong
[45:21] it was inevitable if it has the value
[45:24] that we say that it has of course
[45:26] they're going to want to buy it like so
[45:28] like this idea like oh we have to
[45:30] protect it let them play their leverage
[45:32] games and then everyone will learn that
[45:34] you know you you have to hold it in
[45:36] self- custody and and things like that
[45:39] so I just look at this as like it's all
[45:42] just part of the game theory and like
[45:44] Jeff boot says it's all just noise like
[45:46] you know I'm not I'm not going to fall
[45:48] down the rabbit hole of this is good for
[45:51] Bitcoin this is bad for Bitcoin Bitcoin
[45:53] is just Bitcoin it's just an honest
[45:56] Ledger you know it's it's the human
[45:58] beings that that make all the
[46:01] variables and uh it's it's so
[46:03] fascinating for me when we look at the
[46:05] Bitcoin ITF because um it exposes people
[46:08] to a certain
[46:10] extent H to to to like who is uh
[46:14] actually afraid of Wall Street because
[46:16] if you are like it was so obvious when
[46:19] we want Bitcoin to be money everybody
[46:23] should have access to it the uh the
[46:26] people that we want to have access like
[46:29] the the African people that should be
[46:31] empowered by it but also Wall Street
[46:34] like like do you really think that Wall
[46:37] Street will sleep on it for ages and yes
[46:40] when Wall Street comes in this also
[46:42] empowers the Africans Yep this is also
[46:45] another aspect that uh people don't get
[46:48] like even the the random PLS inside of
[46:52] of the Bitcoin ecosystem they like
[46:54] barely make it but they like save 10 20
[46:56] maybe 00 euros dollars per month in
[46:59] Bitcoin once uh the ETFs come in with
[47:03] the whole financial power that they have
[47:06] it will only go to the upside yeah
[47:10] like it's it's all it's all
[47:12] interconnected so like the ETFs make
[47:15] someone in life someone's life in Africa
[47:18] a lot easier you know even though we're
[47:20] complaining about Wall Street you have
[47:21] to look at the the broader spectrum of
[47:23] this you know like that person is having
[47:26] having such a hard time transacting and
[47:29] like one of the battles you always hear
[47:31] especially from gold bugs like I I don't
[47:33] know why I can't get this through their
[47:34] head they're always like nobody's going
[47:36] into a coffee shop and buying Bitcoin
[47:39] and I said
[47:40] well in Western countries that's not the
[47:43] case yet I said but you're looking at
[47:46] this all wrong Bitcoin is an emergent
[47:49] phenomenon you can't fly Before You Walk
[47:54] So the store of value has to come first
[47:56] first the savings mechanism of it has to
[47:59] come first so if you're just asking oh
[48:03] you have to it has to just be money
[48:05] instantly it doesn't work that way
[48:07] that's not how emerging phenomenons work
[48:09] one the systems have to be built you
[48:12] know like the layers on top of as Jeff
[48:14] Bo talks about the protocols you know
[48:16] the lightning networks and you know
[48:18] liquid and and things like that and then
[48:21] two you have to harden as money first
[48:24] and become less volatile so there's
[48:27] probably this moment
[48:29] like I I like to think of that moment as
[48:32] $1 million a coin because at $1 million
[48:36] a coin one sat is one
[48:41] cent and that's when you could kind of
[48:44] change the unit bias of
[48:47] this you know you you're you you're not
[48:50] looking at this as as dollars anymore
[48:54] you could say one sat is one cent and
[48:58] that once you change that unit bias of
[49:00] this maybe a lot of people won't have
[49:02] that attitude of oh I can't afford a
[49:06] Bitcoin because it's 65,000 because if
[49:08] you if you say one sat is one cent oh I
[49:11] could afford one cent you know like so
[49:13] it it changing that unit bias too is
[49:16] important and it's not going to happen
[49:18] unless it hardens as an asset first and
[49:20] for it to harden it has to go through
[49:21] extreme volatility so so you see the
[49:24] gold bugs will always say well bitcoin's
[49:26] down 10% today you know if you looked at
[49:29] Amazon
[49:30] stock before the bubble it was like $125
[49:35] a share the dot bubble happened it was
[49:38] $5 a share probably the only two people
[49:40] that held it was Bezos and his mother
[49:43] and now take you know what's Amazon
[49:45] stock today like 30 3,000 you know what
[49:49] splits so anything that is an emergent
[49:53] phenomenon has to go through extreme
[49:55] volatilities and Bitcoin is not an
[49:58] emergent phenomenon on a Commerce system
[50:01] like Amazon it's an emergent phenomenon
[50:03] on the whole Global Financial system so
[50:06] it's
[50:08] volatility it's going to be extreme in
[50:11] the early days and you have to stomach
[50:12] it so I kind of chuckle when people say
[50:16] oh I wish I would have bought Bitcoin 10
[50:17] years ago I'm like I always say I wish I
[50:21] would have understood Bitcoin 10 years
[50:22] ago because if I just would have bought
[50:24] it without understanding it I would have
[50:26] sold it
[50:27] so it I I think that there's there's a
[50:30] huge education to this there's there's
[50:32] an understanding you know I always tell
[50:34] people that are new this could drop 20%
[50:37] tomorrow the moment you buy it and if if
[50:40] you don't have this belief ethos you
[50:42] know like I have or other people are
[50:44] projecting you're going to sell you you
[50:47] because you're not understanding what
[50:48] this is this is the exit so you know I I
[50:51] don't know if you go through that these
[50:53] are kind of like the thoughts that go
[50:54] through my head I I love of the analogy
[50:57] with um what did you say you have to
[51:00] first uh run before before you can fly
[51:04] it's it's an amazing analogy when you
[51:06] like uh look at a a baby and yes it
[51:09] crawls first then it like drives to
[51:11] stand and I feel like also the the
[51:14] moment the baby stands it's probably at
[51:17] the million H it's a really really good
[51:19] analogy like then it's it's stands and
[51:21] more and more people uh take it as the
[51:23] medium of exchange even now people use
[51:26] actually bit the buy buy stuff but not
[51:28] at a large scale not especially not in
[51:31] invest on World um but this will come
[51:33] more and more and think about like what
[51:35] what will happen when when Bitcoin is at
[51:37] million a lot of people will already use
[51:39] it and more and more people will shift
[51:41] to a Bitcoin mindset I'm already there
[51:45] where I'm like before I give any
[51:47] significant amount of money out I'm
[51:50] thinking like what what does this cost
[51:52] me in Bitcoin like and where will those
[51:55] where will those can be in 10 15
[52:00] years I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[52:02] interrupt you right before you you got
[52:04] on the call with me someone literally
[52:06] just sent me a text message saying I
[52:08] just spent 27,000 SATs for you know a
[52:11] turkey sandwich in a water and and like
[52:14] so like I totally know where you're
[52:15] coming from because like your brain
[52:17] starts thinking like that it's like wait
[52:19] a second like you know or you start
[52:21] thinking like llo in the pizza like you
[52:24] know 10,000 Bitcoin for two dominoes
[52:26] pizzas you know like you do find
[52:29] yourself thinking like that like so
[52:31] that's where the austerity kicks in you
[52:33] know going back to what I was saying
[52:34] before go ahead I'm
[52:35] sorry no no it's really really
[52:38] fascinating for me and do do you already
[52:39] think that it's it's kind of important
[52:42] that Bitcoin at some point have me I
[52:45] mean it's it's an uh Evolution that will
[52:48] come anyways like bitcoiners will spend
[52:50] the Bitcoin like no like nobody wants to
[52:53] die with 2,000 Bitcoin
[52:57] people will spend it people will buy uh
[53:00] whatever yards houses family like do
[53:04] something for their Community do for
[53:06] something for the family like whatever
[53:08] they want some will buy a Lamborghini
[53:10] some will buy uh their their father into
[53:15] uh what like people will do something
[53:17] with their Bitcoin like that's that's
[53:19] not a but is it important for the
[53:21] adoption that we spend it when we can is
[53:24] it adoption for is is it helping the
[53:28] adoption uh this is a tough question I
[53:31] mean you you ask different bitcoiners
[53:33] you're going to get different answers I
[53:35] know a lot of people are like yeah you
[53:36] have to spend
[53:38] it right now I'm going to say no but
[53:41] eventually yes and I guess the reason
[53:44] I'm going to say no right now is the
[53:47] rails are
[53:49] not very efficient yet once the rails
[53:54] become efficient I would say yes spend
[53:56] your Bitcoin move the system but if
[54:00] you're if you're trying to onboard
[54:04] people on the current construct of
[54:06] things even though you have a Bitcoin
[54:08] ethos it's really hard like it's it's
[54:11] you know I don't even think lightning is
[54:13] going to be the method of payment I
[54:15] think lightning things are going to be
[54:17] built on top of lightning you know as as
[54:19] I'm learning how these layers work like
[54:21] you know lightning might be the system
[54:23] above you know the onchain kind of like
[54:26] a system above Swift you know
[54:29] so I just think like if I gave that
[54:33] analogy of you can't fly before you you
[54:36] walk it's the same thing with the
[54:38] payments mechanisms you can't expect
[54:41] people to use the payment mechanisms
[54:43] until the
[54:44] engineers build the onboarding and
[54:48] that's where you know people like Jeff
[54:50] Booth who were behind the scenes and
[54:52] they're talking about fety men and
[54:53] Breeze and all this stuff he says I
[54:56] can't believe like what I'm seeing he's
[54:59] he's seeing the future firsthand that'll
[55:02] be the the time when those things are
[55:04] out there that'll be the time when I'll
[55:06] change my opinion of yes you need to
[55:08] start spending your Bitcoin to rotate
[55:11] the
[55:12] ecosystem another aspect that uh people
[55:15] seem to forget in that uh in the disc
[55:18] discussion most countries still have
[55:21] taxes when you spend your Bitcoin like I
[55:25] when I spend my Bitcoin and I have to in
[55:28] the end of the year uh report everything
[55:31] to my tax consultant then she is uh
[55:34] calculating what I owed in taxes so like
[55:37] there there is a hurdle to it in most
[55:40] countries obviously like salvad to other
[55:42] countries don't have this tax uh capital
[55:45] gains capital gains tax implications but
[55:48] most actually have then there are some
[55:50] special rules in Germany I feel like
[55:53] it's like when you hold it longer than
[55:54] one year it's taxfree
[55:56] uh so there are like a lot of special
[55:58] rules so this is a thing that we have to
[56:00] still consider because when you pay for
[56:03] like coffee in Bitcoin and then you have
[56:06] to pay 27% on capital gains tax on top
[56:09] of that that's not that's not funny yeah
[56:13] you know I I just want to say like like
[56:15] you I'm responsible I pay my
[56:18] taxes but it's also like irresponsible
[56:22] to spend your Bitcoin and pay taxes on
[56:24] them when when you know how the Fiat
[56:27] system works and you know that the
[56:29] majority of your taxes are going to the
[56:31] interest on the debt that they've
[56:33] accumulated over the last 50 years I
[56:36] think it's something like 60% of like
[56:39] GDP is like going to just like the debt
[56:42] and it's like all right that's Insanity
[56:45] it's like like you're just throwing
[56:46] money away because like the system's
[56:48] insolvent so you do have to think about
[56:51] it from that standpoint like why spend
[56:53] your Bitcoin like spend your Fiat like
[56:56] get rid of it it's it's going to zero
[56:59] anyway at some point and and Save in
[57:02] Bitcoin absolutely um before you come to
[57:05] the end routine uh what was like a
[57:08] surprise or like how did you we coming
[57:11] closer to like the half year mark in
[57:14] 2024 what was kind of like a surprise
[57:16] for you this year what did you like did
[57:19] not expect this year or was there
[57:20] something noteworthy for you obviously
[57:23] we had the ETF we had to having but is
[57:25] there something that was like for you
[57:27] special this year in
[57:30] Bitcoin I
[57:32] think I think the stuff with Daniel
[57:34] baton I don't know if you've ever had
[57:36] him on where I started understanding the
[57:39] energy aspect of it and that it's eating
[57:41] methane is so mindboggling to me like to
[57:46] me that's like a a climate cheat code
[57:50] like like like you found a video game
[57:52] cheat code in Bitcoin and and you know I
[57:55] don't want to get like too crazy and not
[57:57] that I believe this or anything but
[57:58] sometimes I like look at Bitcoin and I'm
[58:00] like this is almost like aliens have
[58:02] handed us something that is just beyond
[58:05] our
[58:06] comprehension and and and like there's
[58:09] it's kind of
[58:10] like if you were the the natives that
[58:13] lived in America you know in the 1400s
[58:17] and you saw the ships coming you have no
[58:20] frame of reference you've never seen a
[58:22] ship before so you probably thought the
[58:24] mountains were moving and that's what I
[58:26] think bitcoin's like I I think that
[58:28] there's no frame of reference there's
[58:30] nothing so we just come up with these
[58:33] like mundane
[58:35] explanations and the truth is it's an
[58:38] emerging phenomenon we've never seen it
[58:39] like it it just imagine showing someone
[58:41] 200 years ago a cell phone they would
[58:43] think you're a witch and and that's kind
[58:45] of like how I feel about Bitcoin it's
[58:47] like this is something that we've never
[58:49] seen and it's very profound so I think
[58:53] the more I learn about like the energy
[58:55] part of it
[58:56] the more I'm blown
[58:59] away and it's fascinating for for me to
[59:01] see um Bitcoin could actually like there
[59:06] are not a lot of really Anonymous people
[59:09] that made a major contribution to
[59:12] society yes I cannot think of anyone
[59:15] else than Sosha Nakamoto right now but
[59:17] probably there are some some people that
[59:19] made major contribution to the world and
[59:21] uh did stay Anonymous um that's
[59:24] fascinating in itself and this also
[59:26] raises the question who was it and this
[59:31] just and and it would be arrogant to say
[59:34] as a human civilization that we are the
[59:36] only ones out there there has to be
[59:39] something bigger than humans there has
[59:41] to be something out there in all those
[59:43] planets in all those
[59:45] civilizations uh where something
[59:48] humanlike or maybe even something that's
[59:50] way smarter than humans is out there and
[59:54] when you look at that way it's not
[59:56] impossible I'm not saying that it is the
[59:58] case but it's not impossible that a
[60:01] really Advanced
[60:02] civilization uh looked at Earth and
[60:05] observed the Earth and just gave us that
[60:08] one thing they thought like ah let's
[60:11] this this would be probably good for
[60:13] them and it would uh give them an
[60:15] advantage um in the same way as like
[60:19] when when you look at the world uh from
[60:21] a dog's
[60:23] perspective yeah exactly
[60:26] like the dog is aware of us but what if
[60:30] the dog wasn't aware of us like like in
[60:33] a maybe a fish is a better example
[60:36] they're like getting getting the the
[60:37] things and they're like it's it it's
[60:40] it's a fascinating thought to think but
[60:41] it's definitely possible and everybody
[60:43] that thinks that that's not possible is
[60:46] probably too too arrogant and thinks
[60:48] that the human civilization is
[60:50] everything and we we are on top of the
[60:52] the whole uh Universe we we're probably
[60:55] not
[60:56] and Bitcoin is a tool that raises that
[60:59] awareness so so it pushes you to another
[61:03] level of of of Truth seeking and and I
[61:06] find that
[61:08] fascinating amazing amazing um before we
[61:11] come to the endro te one last question
[61:13] uh what are you currently uh extremely
[61:15] passionate about uh which we did not
[61:18] cover on the podcast anything that you
[61:20] want to
[61:21] share I mean I'm very fascinated with
[61:27] artificial intelligence and where it's
[61:29] going to take society and and I
[61:33] understand that there's these like
[61:34] viewpoints of it of like oh we need to
[61:36] do this like I need to be scared because
[61:38] of
[61:39] movies
[61:41] and I just kind of tell people that
[61:44] imagine you're in the early
[61:46] 1900s and the car was just
[61:50] invented right now you're that person
[61:52] saying we can't drive around in two ton
[61:55] tin boxes we're going to kill
[61:57] everyone but the value that that car
[62:00] provides
[62:01] like the value that AI will provide to
[62:05] society from from an uplifting
[62:08] standpoint from from food to
[62:11] energy will make us think so much
[62:15] differently that I'm kind of excited
[62:17] about it like I'm a little scared but
[62:19] I'm I'm kind of excited about it at the
[62:21] same
[62:23] time I probably use
[62:26] an EI
[62:27] tool I feel like maybe even like five to
[62:31] 10 times a day in some sort of capacity
[62:35] and two years ago I used zero
[62:38] consciously there was maybe some AI in
[62:40] the background like YouTube already had
[62:43] some some mechanism in there when you
[62:46] like the algorithms it's kind of an AI
[62:48] like of course there there's something
[62:51] that I used two years ago but
[62:52] consciously using AI like chat gbd uh
[62:56] other programs that build on top of that
[62:58] build on other stuff um I use it so many
[63:01] times these days like at least five
[63:03] times more like 10 times on that I have
[63:07] uh own gbt for preparation for guests
[63:09] like I put a lot of content in there a
[63:11] lot of information and it gives me some
[63:13] preparations and some thoughts and
[63:15] directions where we kind of go uh I use
[63:18] it for the Post production a lot uh all
[63:20] the even Riverside where we are
[63:22] currently on uh uses AI to smooth out
[63:25] the podcast as it it's whole uh Clips uh
[63:29] and use then Opus Clips to like get
[63:31] clips from the podcast it's it's it's a
[63:34] lot like I I use AI a lot and when I see
[63:37] how much I used it two years ago and
[63:40] then I'm like how much will I use it two
[63:42] three five years in the future when when
[63:45] the things are really evolved if you
[63:48] want to get an idea of how to answer
[63:50] that question go down the ray kurile
[63:53] rabbit hole and he's been predicting
[63:56] this stuff for 30s something years and
[63:59] he's been pretty fairly accurate about
[64:01] it I think in 1999 he predicted we'd
[64:04] have AGI by 2029 and they all laughed at
[64:07] him and now it's the consensus that it's
[64:09] by
[64:10] 2029 and that's because he measures in
[64:12] exponential curves like you should
[64:14] listen to like where he sees the world
[64:17] in like the next 15 years it'll really
[64:19] melt your
[64:21] mind amazing yeah it's it's uh I say
[64:25] that uh phrase a lot it's it's
[64:27] fascinating to see I I mentioned that I
[64:30] see see that that the phrase I use a lot
[64:32] because it's an it's it's an amazing
[64:34] time to be alive it's amazing time to to
[64:37] be on this on this planet um the you
[64:42] probably know my endrine the endine is
[64:43] like the previous guest is asking a
[64:45] question for the next guest and your
[64:47] question is a really interesting one we
[64:49] did not touch on on that specific Topic
[64:52] in Bitcoin um how are Jesus and zosi
[64:56] Nakamoto different or
[65:00] similar oh man you're asking a
[65:02] non-religious person this question
[65:07] uh that's
[65:09] tough I would say I don't think they're
[65:13] similar at all to be honest with you I I
[65:15] don't think Satoshi is someone to be
[65:18] worshiped in in any way I think it's
[65:20] really bad if we found out who Satoshi
[65:22] is because you know every human has fled
[65:26] and you could kind of demonize that
[65:27] person it's more of what they created
[65:32] and you know if if anything that person
[65:35] should kind of like reframe that
[65:37] question and say how are Jesus and
[65:41] Bitcoin similar and I guess in that
[65:44] sense they're both kind of a search for
[65:46] the truth you know you know e even if
[65:49] it's not my truth it may be somebody
[65:51] else's truth but they're both attempts
[65:53] to search for a truth in the world so so
[65:57] that would be how I would say they're
[65:59] similar amazing um before I let you go
[66:03] uh where can people find you in the best
[66:07] way shape or form uh like where can
[66:09] people ask your questions where can
[66:10] people reach you yeah I'm just starting
[66:13] to put myself out there um I'm at
[66:15] Bitcoin Mike 23 on Twitter that's
[66:19] probably the best way to find me uh I
[66:21] will definitely answer any DMS that
[66:24] aren't spam
[66:26] so you know I'm always willing to come
[66:30] on any podcast and talk like I find
[66:32] Bitcoin fascinating like it it's changed
[66:35] my life I feel like the noise is turned
[66:38] down with everything else because I've
[66:40] found this
[66:42] signal I love it so much um thank you
[66:45] for being on Mike thank you for everyone
[66:48] listening uh and as always I'll be back
[66:50] tomorrow with another guest bye-bye
