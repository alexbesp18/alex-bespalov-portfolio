[00:00] Bitcoin is really a change and we're at
[00:02] a Crossroads the Fiat system it's
[00:04] corrupted and we're heading towards
[00:05] cbdcs which is not a good thing at all
[00:08] they don't understand that freedom comes
[00:09] with responsibility the first quarter of
[00:12] 2022 we had tens of millions customer
[00:15] funds lost through our platform because
[00:17] they were scammed and didn't understand
[00:19] how to deal with self- custody imagine
[00:21] there were cbdcs during covid and during
[00:24] the lockdowns it would have been a
[00:25] perfect tool to actually let people not
[00:28] buy at certain areas not get into to a
[00:30] restaurant not do this or that just by
[00:32] programming it into the money and that's
[00:34] the danger of cbdcs we have the
[00:37] possibility to end up in a totalitarian
[00:40] uh surveillance uh situation and on the
[00:43] other hand we have a huge chance with
[00:45] Bitcoin to change a lot for the better
[00:47] next 3 to 5 years will be super
[00:50] interesting imagine if officially nation
[00:52] states get into Bitcoin and start
[00:54] accumulating Bitcoin we could indeed see
[00:57] hyperbitcoinization there's a lot of of
[01:00] companies and Wales on institutional
[01:03] money coming in and the retail crowd is
[01:05] sleeping the window is closing in terms
[01:07] of uh getting Bitcoin for a reasonable
[01:09] price Nostra in 2024 is like Bitcoin in
[01:11] 2012 don't hide on Nostra we need people
[01:15] on Twitter on Instagram on Tik Tok on
[01:18] YouTube to be active Bitcoin
[01:21] [Music]
[01:25] Advocates what did you learn so far from
[01:27] interviewing so many great people in in
[01:30] in
[01:31] Bitcoin well I learned that it's a very
[01:35] strong community that they um are in
[01:38] general very let's say mainstream
[01:40] critical they think they that uh Bitcoin
[01:44] can is really a change and we're at a
[01:46] crossroads right where on one hand we
[01:48] have the possibility to end up in like a
[01:51] totalitarian uh surveillance uh situ
[01:56] situation and on the other hand we have
[01:58] a huge chance with Bitcoin to change a
[02:00] lot for the better stuff that wasn't
[02:04] really fixed for let's say even uh
[02:07] centuries or thousands of years you
[02:09] could even say uh yeah the money issue
[02:12] um that money can be inflated and yeah
[02:16] Bitcoin is an answer to that and yeah
[02:19] people on bitcoin conferences yeah they
[02:22] uh they realize that and um yeah it's a
[02:26] strong community and um
[02:31] yeah
[02:32] especially after uh covid you know it's
[02:36] a very refreshing thing to meet these
[02:38] kind of people who are generally
[02:41] critical and then you end up wondering a
[02:44] lot of things
[02:47] actually so many things uh from
[02:50] nutrition
[02:53] to yeah realizing that we live in a in
[02:56] an environment where there's a lot of
[02:58] propaganda um to yeah the Fiat system of
[03:02] course it's corrupted and we're heading
[03:04] towards cbdcs
[03:07] um which is not a good thing at all um
[03:10] yeah so yeah I generally ask questions
[03:14] and um you know I I like to learn and
[03:17] maybe even teach like peer-to-peer
[03:19] learning peer-to-peer teaching you could
[03:22] say
[03:23] um and that's what I find interesting
[03:28] um and yeah those conferences give give
[03:31] that opportunity you know I can ask
[03:33] questions I I did surveys a lot so I
[03:35] asked uh Bitcoin professionals
[03:38] enthusiasts industry leaders certain
[03:40] questions and I get all the different
[03:42] takes on one question so that's kind of
[03:45] interesting for me
[03:47] um so yeah that's what I'm doing right
[03:50] now I I love it a lot so but but you
[03:53] you're doing that full-time now or like
[03:55] you still have fear chop next to it or
[03:58] right now I'm giving myself some time to
[04:01] do that and let's see where that goes um
[04:03] before I was working well let's say in
[04:06] the
[04:07] beginning I don't have an economic
[04:10] background you know I
[04:12] um I used to study music production and
[04:16] composition uh I worked in the media
[04:18] production industry for a while then in
[04:20] marketing um that's a it's a while back
[04:23] uh I had no idea about finances I never
[04:25] saved money
[04:27] um uh yeah so that was never an an a
[04:31] topic for me and I remember my
[04:33] stepfather telling me like you have to
[04:38] spend your money you have to bring your
[04:39] money into circulation um and then it
[04:43] will come back to you like the law of
[04:45] attraction or law of circulation and
[04:47] that's basically how I live for a long
[04:49] time um earning money and then spending
[04:53] it and then having nothing left and uh
[04:55] it took until my mid-30s that I actually
[04:58] had because of some partnership that I
[05:00] had with some business I had a little
[05:02] money left
[05:03] over and it was the first time that I
[05:06] actually had to think yeah what should I
[05:07] do with that money um it's uh it's too
[05:11] much to just spend it now and I wouldn't
[05:14] know what to spend it on so it was the
[05:16] first time that I had had to think about
[05:18] it and generally I was always a bit
[05:20] mainstream critical
[05:22] and
[05:23] um yeah
[05:25] so but I I got into watching YouTube
[05:29] videos and then I started uh yeah
[05:33] getting into precious metals and also
[05:35] crypto currencies and
[05:38] um yeah I was never into shares that
[05:41] kind of never attracted me because it it
[05:44] didn't feel like real ownership and I
[05:46] also was working for a lot of companies
[05:48] in marketing so I know that companies
[05:51] always portray a very different image
[05:54] often than what actually is happening
[05:56] inside and so that wasn't really
[05:59] interesting interesting to me it was
[06:00] precious metal and crypto and at that
[06:02] time I wasn't really uh yeah Bitcoin
[06:05] Maxi so for me it was basically the same
[06:08] thing I did understand self- custody is
[06:10] important and um yeah so that's where I
[06:15] started investing or saving let's say
[06:18] and um at some point I also said it was
[06:21] like the beginning of the pandemic like
[06:24] yeah why not work in that area you know
[06:26] it wasn't really happy with what I'm
[06:28] doing what I was doing it at that at
[06:30] that
[06:31] time um being a consultant in marketing
[06:35] and I just thought let's um yeah find a
[06:39] job in in crypto or Bitcoin at that time
[06:41] I was yeah it was I knew Bitcoin was
[06:44] important but I wasn't really making a
[06:47] clear distinction so I was I started to
[06:50] look and uh didn't really find anything
[06:53] I figured out figured that or realized
[06:56] that uh yeah there is
[07:00] not that many jobs that easily to be
[07:02] found if you're not a programmer um but
[07:05] I then I found a job at bitana I don't
[07:07] know if you know
[07:08] bitana and they were situated in Berlin
[07:11] and I went into customer service tra
[07:14] customer service there was a big career
[07:17] change and from there I went to the
[07:20] fraud Squad I went into compliance from
[07:22] there I went into marketing and from
[07:24] there I went into business
[07:26] development so I went through several
[07:28] stages in that company and bitva what
[07:31] used to
[07:33] be um a German Rel quite known company
[07:37] that combined self- custody wallets of
[07:39] Bitcoin and
[07:41] ethereum with um bank account in one app
[07:44] and that was basically they were the
[07:47] only ones at that time they
[07:49] actually went bankrupt after the bare
[07:52] Market or during the bare market and
[07:54] then also relaunched again um but yeah I
[07:58] started um
[08:00] yeah um working there and yeah I I
[08:04] noticed firsthand what the real problems
[08:06] are of people that get into crypto offer
[08:09] for the wrong reasons you know and in
[08:11] that respect uh yeah self- custody is
[08:16] one of the biggest risks when people get
[08:18] into crypto for the wrong reasons
[08:20] because they don't understand it that
[08:21] freedom comes with responsibility you
[08:24] know so um um yeah I worked in the
[08:27] frauds quad right uh and um if I
[08:32] remember
[08:33] correctly the first quarter of 2022 we
[08:37] had tens of millions of funds
[08:41] lost from for uh customer funds lost
[08:44] through our platform because they were
[08:46] scammed and didn't understand how to
[08:48] deal with self- custody you know so then
[08:52] uh it so wa they had it in self custody
[08:54] and they lost it because they got got
[08:57] hacked either they they uh didn't take
[09:00] it seriously with the keys even though
[09:02] we have several had several warnings um
[09:05] they didn't take it seriously and then
[09:06] they lost the
[09:08] keys and they changed their phone and
[09:10] they had to repport the wallet and then
[09:14] we couldn't help them anymore and with
[09:17] uh with
[09:18] um uh with fraud there's a lot of fraud
[09:22] uh going on where especially Elder
[09:25] people uh elderly people get contacted
[09:29] through phone WhatsApp uh chat messages
[09:32] by so-called Brokers that tell them yeah
[09:35] why don't you invest a little bit uh
[09:37] into um Bitcoin or crypto and then they
[09:41] spend a couple of hundred euros and then
[09:45] over
[09:47] okay is okay in I don't see you just
[09:53] change the
[09:55] camera second
[10:00] even though so now it went to my
[10:03] uh it went to my um MacBook camera and
[10:09] even though my so should I change it or
[10:12] should I what should I do I we we can
[10:15] continue like that if you want it's a
[10:18] good camera I feel like actually not
[10:20] that I mean it's different but it's fine
[10:24] um so where was I
[10:28] um with frauds and and what also really
[10:32] interests me in that is like um how like
[10:36] if you have it in s custody and you
[10:38] didn't not lose anything but you
[10:39] actually get frauded out of that like
[10:41] someone scams you actually out of your
[10:43] your Bitcoin how do this usually uh work
[10:46] is it just an email are they calling
[10:49] people like how do they do that well
[10:51] they sometimes do it in a Smart Way
[10:55] um
[10:57] um well even I there was an attempt for
[11:00] to fraud me recently because I once had
[11:03] like 10000 on
[11:05] blocki and then I basically took all of
[11:08] it away but there were maybe3 EUR left
[11:11] and that's when I got got uh an email
[11:15] saying that I could uh get my funds back
[11:18] and actually was a fraud attempt but
[11:21] with regards to those people they get
[11:23] contacted by a so-called broker then
[11:26] they invest a little money and that
[11:28] becomes a lot of money and they show
[11:30] them graphs where they make almost like
[11:32] 30k 50k 100K whatever and then they say
[11:36] yeah uh let's do the payout and you can
[11:38] do that via pitala our company you just
[11:41] have to open an account and um either
[11:45] they then also tell them that they will
[11:47] help them and and set up the the the
[11:50] wallet and they share their screen set
[11:52] up the wallet and then they have no idea
[11:55] that that's an absolute noo right and
[11:58] and then they can take the funds
[12:00] directly from it because then later on
[12:02] they send an email that is in most cases
[12:05] designed as if it was sent by us or by
[12:08] bital back then just from different
[12:11] email address and those people a lot of
[12:13] people don't really check where it's
[12:14] been sent from and then it says yeah
[12:17] your your funds got stuck on the
[12:19] blockchain and you have to pay up front
[12:22] uh 10% of uh your earnings 5K 10K and
[12:27] transform it uh uh convert it into
[12:30] Bitcoin and either leave it there
[12:32] because they already have the keys or
[12:34] transfer it to another address if they
[12:37] didn't manage to get the keys and they
[12:40] often do that as well not knowing what
[12:42] the consequences are and then the money
[12:44] is gone and in many cases they keep
[12:47] doing the same attempt again and again
[12:50] so I even had a woman who did it again
[12:53] and again and and she lost hundreds of
[12:58] thousands of euros and uh yeah that's a
[13:02] big drama yeah so so wait wait there's a
[13:06] a woman who lost it like that and then
[13:09] got scammed again with the same method
[13:11] or for some reason there are people who
[13:15] uh are willing to do it again and again
[13:17] and again for whatever excuse they're
[13:19] telling them
[13:21] yeah interesting yeah it's it's on the
[13:24] one hand it's really sad but on the
[13:26] other hand um like like if you're not
[13:30] educated 100% on that topic they they
[13:35] sound like logical steps that you
[13:38] actually have to do and they uh misuse
[13:41] The Good Will of people which really
[13:43] pisses me off like these are those are
[13:46] people who have a good will and good
[13:49] intentions in their heart otherwise they
[13:50] would never fall like people that are
[13:52] extremely skeptical about things and and
[13:55] they like but they would those who fall
[13:58] for those usually really nice and kind
[14:01] people and this is the the part of it
[14:03] where like on the one hand I'm like yeah
[14:06] okay they they they got robbed and they
[14:09] they transferred it to it they did not
[14:10] check it so like there's one part in me
[14:13] like oh yeah it's it's your fault you
[14:15] did it uh but on the other side it's
[14:17] like I really feel with them like that
[14:19] that's that's hard and they they they
[14:21] they just had the best intentions yeah
[14:23] absolutely it's a a big drama for a lot
[14:26] of people people losing their life
[14:28] savings
[14:29] at the end of their lives especially
[14:31] older people so I mean I have a love
[14:34] hate I don't even have a love
[14:36] relationship with compliance I kind of
[14:39] hate compliance but I was working in
[14:41] that area for a bit um but it is kind of
[14:45] necessary you know um that you kind of
[14:49] at least some people need custody you
[14:51] know and and to double check what's
[14:53] going on and especially with older
[14:55] people at some point we kind of stopped
[14:59] uh transactions um for elderly people
[15:03] like 50 plus who opened an account and
[15:06] immediately uh converted big sums of
[15:08] money into Bitcoin that was already like
[15:10] a red flag and then then compliance
[15:14] steps in and ask yeah what are you doing
[15:16] I mean I kind of hated that part but I
[15:19] also on the other hand saw that um it's
[15:23] sometimes yeah helping
[15:26] people but for the rest it's kind of
[15:29] blackbox and also like an excuse to not
[15:33] communicate anything yeah compliance
[15:34] blocked you and compliance didn't
[15:36] communicate internally what's going on
[15:39] uh so nobody knows and it's compliance
[15:42] and compliance always prefers to be
[15:44] complied instead of logical or
[15:47] reasonable so
[15:50] yeah this this brings me to an
[15:52] interesting question um there's a fine
[15:55] line between uh helping people having
[15:59] those guard rails up this compliance
[16:01] guard rails and being an Overlord of
[16:05] controlling those people like total
[16:08] freedom for the individual also means
[16:11] that they can screw up and there are no
[16:13] guard rails as with Bitcoin if you
[16:15] transfer your Bitcoin to an other next
[16:17] stress uh because you got scammed
[16:19] they're gone it's not no no no longer
[16:21] your Bitcoin and it's your fault uh
[16:24] someone else scammed you uh but uh you
[16:28] in the end of the day they signed the
[16:30] transaction uh so that that's like a a
[16:33] fine line between like we we want
[16:36] freedom uh but we also want to protect
[16:39] people I think a better term maybe might
[16:41] be educate people uh so they can protect
[16:45] themselves uh it's it's it's interesting
[16:48] where do you draw uh uh the this line
[16:51] for yourself do I don't know what this
[16:54] has to do with Bitcoin but it's just
[16:55] came up in my mind yeah I mean I don't
[16:57] like the compliance part because it is
[17:00] in many ways just backward and and in
[17:03] intransparent and also illogical uh but
[17:07] I also saw the other side and I kind of
[17:10] understand and I got many police
[17:13] requests to deal with where they asked
[17:14] for the data of the transaction history
[17:16] and yeah I kind of thought well I hope
[17:19] you catch them the chances are slim but
[17:21] maybe you
[17:22] can um yeah well it's all about
[17:25] education you know um we have to educate
[17:28] people and maybe even have them
[17:31] follow a short course before opening at
[17:35] least in an app where you can
[17:37] immediately uh convert um money into
[17:41] Bitcoin where they kind of have to
[17:44] go uh through a course where
[17:46] they yeah where they prove that they at
[17:49] least understand the most basic things
[17:51] so I think it's all about educa
[17:53] education teaching people how it works
[17:56] and a lot of people are working hard on
[17:59] doing that I mean you do that uh in your
[18:02] way uh many people do that in their own
[18:05] way I'm trying to do that and
[18:09] um
[18:11] yeah
[18:15] go I think I think we kind of have to do
[18:18] it and we have to uh really go out there
[18:21] because you you said in the beginning
[18:23] you were always a little bit critical uh
[18:25] against what was popular like what we
[18:27] call uh the mainstream um where where
[18:31] did it come from do you think like is
[18:33] that something that was an event or is
[18:35] that always like oh I was always
[18:37] critical against uh against mainstream
[18:40] mainstream things because I was I was
[18:43] not always critical I was like on the
[18:45] other side I was like oh like the
[18:47] mainstream and it's like exactly that
[18:49] line of like mainstream thinking and
[18:51] reversed a lot uh very early on I mean
[18:54] I'm still just 26 so uh everything is
[18:56] early on but uh how was that for you I
[18:59] cannot really tell you where it
[19:00] originally came from but it
[19:03] certainly became very uh present with
[19:08] covid you know where I realized there's
[19:10] a lot going on that is not okay and from
[19:14] there you start questioning a lot of
[19:16] things um you know um and also the
[19:19] Bitcoin Community if you talk with those
[19:21] people you you can get into all kind of
[19:24] uh side topics you know from Fiat build
[19:28] building Fiat nutrition um Fiat Wars
[19:33] um yeah you start wondering I never
[19:37] thought that but then I started
[19:38] wondering is it actually actually a
[19:40] better thing to have the right to own
[19:42] arms uh I always thought that's actually
[19:45] not a good idea is there really a
[19:48] climate crisis you can get into all
[19:50] kinds of topics and
[19:52] uh yeah I can't really say where it
[19:55] originally came from I think that's just
[19:57] a little bit my type of character but it
[20:00] became very present once we went through
[20:04] the whole Co
[20:06] thing absolutely I think that was
[20:09] a that was probably a wakeup call for
[20:13] for for a lot of people um one thing
[20:16] that you also mentioned was cbdcs and
[20:18] it's it's super interesting um it cbdcs
[20:22] don't come up as much with non German
[20:27] people I I I see I I feel like cbdcs is
[20:32] uh a topic that's really present in in
[20:35] the German speaking Community when I
[20:37] speak with uh when I speak with Africans
[20:41] uh it's almost no topic uh with
[20:44] Americans it is a topic but they don't
[20:46] fear it because the American politicians
[20:49] are quite against uh cbdcs like they a
[20:52] lot of legislations and and things
[20:53] against that uh with Canadians I have it
[20:56] also Canadians there's also a uh fear of
[20:59] that because of their government
[21:01] probably uh so um it's it's super
[21:04] interesting why is CBB cbdc is an
[21:07] important topic for you I mean obviously
[21:10] it's it's not a good thing uh but is how
[21:14] much worse is uh cbdc to the current
[21:18] digital uh Euro that that that we have
[21:21] and and where do you see the danger in
[21:24] there because it completely centralizes
[21:27] control and it's a tool to um manipulate
[21:31] our habits you know it's programmable
[21:34] money and you can um add a expiry date
[21:38] to the money you can confiscate money at
[21:42] click of
[21:43] mouse you can make it only valid for
[21:46] certain products in certain uh areas um
[21:50] imagine there were cbdcs during covid
[21:53] and during the lockdowns it was a perf
[21:56] it would have been a perfect tool to
[21:58] actually
[22:00] yeah let people not buy at certain areas
[22:03] not get into a restaurant not do this or
[22:05] that um just by um programming it into
[22:09] the money and that's the danger of
[22:12] cbdcs and we have enough um statements
[22:16] from like um people in that area that
[22:20] it's at the end of the day also the what
[22:22] they want you know more control um
[22:26] um so yeah and then you have bit coin um
[22:29] so we're certainly at the crossroads at
[22:32] the moment and um yeah I hope enough
[22:35] people wake up early enough so so so
[22:39] it's either either the Bitcoin Crossroad
[22:42] like the cross Crossroads between either
[22:43] Bitcoin or or cbcs yeah I mean if there
[22:46] was no Bitcoin that would be
[22:49] pretty H not so
[22:54] good right I mean so Bitcoin is hope for
[22:56] me as well you know if there was no bit
[22:58] coin so being in Bitcoin and and doing
[23:02] that whole thing is also not because
[23:05] you uh want gains of it's mainly also
[23:09] because it's also hope you know um to an
[23:13] answer
[23:14] to what is otherwise coming to us you
[23:19] know is that for you the more present uh
[23:23] like is that the uh bigger reason for
[23:26] you to have the control of your own
[23:29] money and to be uh not able to be
[23:33] controlled in the transactions censored
[23:35] in the transactions to be able to go out
[23:37] of countries or is it the monetary
[23:39] policy part where uh the currency is not
[23:42] devalued so your value is actually
[23:45] rising in the purchasing power like this
[23:46] these are the for me always the two main
[23:49] parts of of of Bitcoin what is what is
[23:51] stronger for you yeah I think it's it's
[23:53] similar because uh it's of course being
[23:56] in control of your uh purchasing power
[24:00] of your wealth of your time working time
[24:03] that you preserved in
[24:06] money uh and inflation is of course also
[24:09] a way of losing that control of or
[24:12] losing the purchasing power so it's kind
[24:14] of for
[24:15] me similar so yeah I don't want to lose
[24:18] my purchasing power because that also
[24:19] means I'm not really in control of my
[24:22] funds either you know so yeah I don't
[24:26] like either you know
[24:30] you need kind of both to make it
[24:32] sense you you kind of need both to to
[24:34] make sense like I think you cannot have
[24:36] one on the other if you have full
[24:38] control of how you can transact it only
[24:41] then you can also have full control of
[24:42] of it because otherwise someone can
[24:44] control it yeah I mean if you if you uh
[24:47] have full control about uh spending
[24:51] hyper inflating currencies wherever you
[24:54] want that's also not really full control
[24:56] right
[24:59] someone still controls uh the the
[25:02] monetary Supply but I think you you I
[25:05] think you cannot have it uh only one lay
[25:08] like if someone can uh stop your
[25:11] transaction probably someone can also
[25:13] manipulate the money supply of a
[25:15] currency if if that that kind of power
[25:18] is is kind of built in either like both
[25:20] ways or or no ways I feel like uh
[25:24] because with every currency uh it is
[25:26] like that y
[25:28] absolutely yeah you I also saw you were
[25:31] in the German Parliament and I never
[25:34] spoke about that on the podcast and I
[25:36] thought like I I should definitely do
[25:39] that
[25:40] because like right now in the in the
[25:42] Bitcoin Community when you talk about
[25:44] Germany everyone uh has this 50,000
[25:47] Bitcoin that they sold uh in the mind
[25:50] like that that's the only thing we know
[25:52] now from from Germany in the in the
[25:55] National Community um and I think it's
[25:58] major mistake from them uh but still uh
[26:02] they kind of were forced to and there
[26:03] were a lot of things involved with with
[26:05] even being able to do that uh what's
[26:08] going on would you say in the German
[26:10] politics with Bitcoin and what insights
[26:13] did you gain from from the German
[26:16] Parliament and being inv visitor there
[26:18] yeah in general I mean a lot of Bitcoin
[26:20] I want nothing to do with uh politics
[26:24] it's like Bitcoin in itself is like a
[26:27] political it's neutral and since
[26:30] governments are resistant to reform and
[26:33] kind of corrupt uh yeah a lot of
[26:36] Bitcoins are not into that but yeah I've
[26:38] seen I've been to several Bitcoin in
[26:41] bundestag uh events and I just seen
[26:44] that we have some allies in politics and
[26:47] they're real bitcoiners and they really
[26:49] want to bring change and and they're
[26:52] really asking and getting active and I
[26:56] think we need to get active and we Al
[26:58] also see results right in general in
[27:01] globally I mean it's a first of all it's
[27:05] a topic in the presidential race in the
[27:08] US um which is a huge thing I didn't
[27:12] expect this to go so
[27:15] quickly um it's a topic as a strategic
[27:18] Reserve I mean that's not really the
[27:20] case in Germany yet so I'm don't have a
[27:23] lot of hope that uh Germany is going to
[27:25] catch up in that way but once uh the
[27:30] US does their first move um Germany
[27:34] could follow suit and yeah so it's
[27:37] interesting because they made several um
[27:40] events where they had Roman Ria which
[27:42] you I guess know um made presentation he
[27:45] was also on the podcast uh already on on
[27:49] this podcast so like if people want to
[27:51] check it out it was and really
[27:52] interesting very inspirational also with
[27:55] his story with his illness also was a
[27:59] great one what he shared there uh Roman
[28:01] Reay had just uh searching in the thing
[28:04] but yeah so absolutely and it was just
[28:08] interesting because everything is about
[28:10] privacy in these events right so there
[28:12] are people that are interested so either
[28:15] the members of parliament send their
[28:18] employees to have a look and check it
[28:20] out because Joanna kotar who's the
[28:22] initiator sends out emails to all the
[28:25] MPS and then either some in peace come
[28:29] by
[28:30] themselves uh or they send their
[28:31] employees to have a look so there's some
[28:34] interest absolutely and uh most events
[28:37] were quite well
[28:39] attended but they don't really want to
[28:42] be associated with a Bitcoin in many
[28:44] cases so I had some interviews there and
[28:47] I always had to take care that I don't
[28:49] film anyone who doesn't give like uh
[28:53] consent um so that was interesting
[28:56] there's stuff going on at at the
[28:58] um latest or the potentially last event
[29:01] I talked to samsum ma who is like the
[29:03] nation state bit orange pillar right he
[29:07] was there for the last event and I asked
[29:10] him if there's like stuff going on
[29:12] undercover like um U politicians
[29:16] actually being in favor of Bitcoin but
[29:18] not daring to speak out because of all
[29:20] this
[29:21] privacy and yeah probably there are
[29:24] quite some bit uh politicians that are
[29:26] invested uh
[29:28] but I also realized that the whole party
[29:32] system doesn't
[29:34] really allow politicians to speak their
[29:37] mind right you speak according to the uh
[29:40] party uh
[29:42] book or because if you speak your mind
[29:46] if you you act according to your
[29:47] conscience that's not really a good uh
[29:50] recipe to get
[29:53] um into a better position or keep your
[29:55] position in politics so that's kind of
[29:57] yeah I mean is that how it
[30:00] works that's a bit uh disappointing but
[30:03] that's apparently how it works so yeah
[30:06] under cover there or well there's
[30:09] interest and they certainly um they even
[30:13] had uh courses where they um explained
[30:17] how you set up a wallet uh how what
[30:19] self- custody is so there's interest and
[30:23] um yeah but we will still have to see
[30:26] with regards to Germany how well that is
[30:29] being uh put into practice and what the
[30:32] real effects are and I guess it still
[30:35] depends a lot on what's going on in
[30:37] other places in the world especially in
[30:38] the
[30:39] US I partnered up with coin vigilante
[30:44] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[30:46] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[30:49] look at that beauty I love it so much
[30:52] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[30:55] watch that's the perfect subtle ENT way
[30:59] to go out there and show that you are a
[31:01] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:04] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:07] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:10] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:12] collections you have the date of the
[31:14] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:18] and of course also the block height and
[31:20] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[31:24] level of detail they put in in this
[31:27] masterpiece and and make sure to check
[31:29] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[31:32] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[31:34] those watches so so much if you watch or
[31:38] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:40] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:42] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:45] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[31:48] in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:50] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:52] the bit box it's super secure it's
[31:54] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[31:57] for a friend has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:00] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:04] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:06] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:10] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:12] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:15] individual you have to have the most
[32:17] secure self- custody setup you have to
[32:19] secure your own devices you have to
[32:22] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:25] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:28] where you live you even want to have a
[32:30] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:33] in case something goes really really
[32:35] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:37] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[32:50] level up your
[32:51] sovereignty do do you think it will
[32:53] change like us is is is a major one
[32:56] because uh even camela Harris came out
[33:00] and and said positive things about it
[33:02] like she she's not publicly with her
[33:06] words against uh uh Bitcoin or uh at war
[33:10] with Bitcoin you might make an argument
[33:13] that she has been hostile with her
[33:15] actions uh I don't know about uh us
[33:18] politics too much uh but I have never
[33:20] heard I think she never I actually never
[33:23] heard her say
[33:25] Bitcoin I I don't know if it's a good or
[33:28] bad thing but uh it's it's fascinating
[33:31] that Trump is so vocal about it and he
[33:34] even made a tweet today about the the
[33:38] white paper day because today this
[33:40] podcast will be out two weeks later than
[33:42] that but we recording on the 31 so the
[33:44] white paper uh day in Bitcoin so that's
[33:48] uh super interesting that he
[33:50] acknowledges that day and uh he I don't
[33:53] know he he said something I will fight
[33:55] for your rights and then it will stop
[33:57] the war against Bitcoin from from camela
[34:01] and she he only used a crypto in that
[34:03] tweet like one time and Bitcoin like
[34:05] four times so he gets better yeah
[34:07] because yeah that was a little different
[34:09] beforehand he launched also his own
[34:11] shitcoin let's
[34:13] say yeah he this world Liberty
[34:18] whatever but he's not against Bitcoin
[34:20] and that's good and I don't know why ca
[34:23] had this sudden U-turn but well that's
[34:27] in general great news I'm uh very
[34:30] excited and interested to see how that
[34:33] turns out you know in in America the
[34:36] water block of bitcoiners is just too
[34:40] big like you in in America they have
[34:43] this President system where like the
[34:44] winner takes it all kind of uh and you
[34:48] kind of need like 70 to 80 million uh
[34:52] votes to to win uh like it also you need
[34:56] in the right swing state and everything
[34:58] like that uh not getting into that in
[35:00] detail but um that that's uh really
[35:04] interesting when you look at how many
[35:06] bitcoiners are there in in America and
[35:09] then uh how many voters do you need and
[35:12] that uh amount is is pretty similar like
[35:16] you have like 50 to 100 million
[35:18] bitcoiners or have like Bitcoin on their
[35:22] asset in some sort so like 50 million is
[35:25] the most gases like some go a little
[35:28] higher I always try to stay conservative
[35:30] and say 50 million people in America
[35:32] have Bitcoin exposure in some sense and
[35:35] if you see that and you need like 70
[35:37] million to 80 million to win a vote
[35:40] that's that's a major block of Voters uh
[35:44] for for someone to gain and that's why
[35:47] Trump is speaking about it if there
[35:48] would be like five million bitcoiners he
[35:51] would not be that vocal about it he
[35:52] would not take his time out and go to a
[35:54] Bitcoin conference that's where we were
[35:56] four years years and eight years ago
[35:59] where he did not show up and he was even
[36:00] hostile a little bit with his words
[36:02] against Bitcoin I mean I didn't know
[36:04] that there were so many bitcoiners in in
[36:07] the US but that's basically also what
[36:08] Joanna cotar says in Germany people tend
[36:12] to not open their mouth as much and she
[36:15] said you have to talk to your local
[36:17] politicians that Bitcoin is a topic for
[36:19] you if you want to have them change your
[36:22] politics and um yeah that's what she
[36:25] working on I'm not sure uh German um
[36:29] culture let's say is a little bit
[36:30] different um but yeah it it uh
[36:35] politicians want to get reelected right
[36:37] so if they realize that it's a big topic
[36:40] they might do something
[36:43] yeah absolutely and and that's what what
[36:46] is so interesting about the times I feel
[36:48] like it's a really great time to be
[36:50] alive right now next three to five years
[36:53] will be super interesting in I age
[36:55] absolutely yeah I'm very curious yeah
[36:59] I have no clue what's going on but
[37:01] that's why I ask all my guests oh what
[37:03] do you expect for the next years do do
[37:05] you have an answer for that well with
[37:07] regards to bitcoin adoption I thought it
[37:10] was expected to go slower than it's
[37:13] actually going but with regards to the
[37:15] Bitcoin price I actually expect expected
[37:18] it to go faster so I I've seen much more
[37:22] adoption and promising news than what I
[37:25] expected but I thought the price price
[37:27] would be much higher um while in general
[37:31] I I'm very bullish and
[37:35] um yeah very bullish I cannot really put
[37:37] a number on it
[37:40] um um but I'm I kind of imagine if
[37:44] really officially nation states get into
[37:48] Bitcoin and start accumulating Bitcoin
[37:51] we could indeed see some sort of
[37:53] hyperbitcoinization right because if the
[37:56] race is on and everyone joins in then
[38:00] there is a real hard cap a fixed Supply
[38:03] and that will get into effect at some
[38:06] point and then on the other hand We have
[38:09] basically even central banks who could
[38:11] print out of uh could print money out of
[38:13] thin air to get more Bitcoin it it it
[38:16] could get crazy but let's
[38:19] see I I want to share something with
[38:22] with you really quickly uh that is super
[38:25] interesting for me always to look in
[38:26] because even though um AI is getting
[38:30] more and more popular and I personally
[38:32] use Google less and less actually uh so
[38:35] maybe this those charts will be outdated
[38:38] at some point because nobody uses Google
[38:40] anymore for searching but I think right
[38:42] now they still have a lot of uh
[38:44] interesting like this they had a lot of
[38:47] legitimacy around uh how well something
[38:52] how interesting something is right now
[38:54] for the retail crowd not so interes it's
[38:57] it's it's at the start so
[39:00] right it's super low like if if you see
[39:04] we were basically here in 2021 at the
[39:08] height um we have a higher high we had
[39:12] here and with the Bitcoin price
[39:14] especially if you account for more
[39:16] Bitcoins or the market capitalization
[39:18] was big bigger actually because there
[39:20] are more Bitcoin uh blasted price so
[39:23] there's a lot of I think companies and
[39:26] Wales on institutional money coming in I
[39:29] think uh and the retail crowd is
[39:31] sleeping like nobody's talking about
[39:33] Bitcoin nobody is interested in Bitcoin
[39:35] seems like we are still in a bare Market
[39:37] when you look at those charts I mean I
[39:39] I've written an article on my blog I
[39:41] think it was the first about Bitcoin in
[39:44] beginning of
[39:45] 2021 which I titled uh jump on the
[39:49] bandwagon before the whales do and
[39:52] hoping that's would be what would be my
[39:55] hope that uh retail and normal people
[39:58] jump in first and then uh yeah the big
[40:02] players come in after but that's kind of
[40:06] over now I mean uh now the big players
[40:08] come in they're they're already in and
[40:11] uh well the message is still the
[40:15] same uh join us uh but uh yeah so the
[40:18] whales are definitely in the game now
[40:21] and um the window is closing in terms of
[40:25] uh uh getting Bitcoin for a reasonable
[40:29] reasonable uh
[40:31] price absolutely and uh I think uh the
[40:35] most amazing thing for me is the
[40:37] corporate uh the company adoption of
[40:40] Bitcoin that that seems to be uh just
[40:43] just going straight up with how many
[40:45] companies will will do that did you hear
[40:48] about Microsoft I heard that
[40:51] yeah man How likely do you think it it
[40:54] is that Microsoft actually buys Bitcoin
[40:57] I think it's quite likely I'm I'm not I
[40:59] don't really understand how this voting
[41:02] system internally works but it's
[41:04] apparently the employers that decide if
[41:07] they should invest in Bitcoin or not
[41:09] right and there have a lot of I did the
[41:11] the shareholders
[41:13] shareholders and they have a lot of
[41:15] employees would be an interesting
[41:18] one yeah I think
[41:21] it's likely and if they don't do it it
[41:23] will be someone else I mean you heard
[41:25] about Michael saor right he's trying
[41:28] to what was
[41:30] that 4 42
[41:34] billion that's uh
[41:37] crazy I was seeing that and I was like
[41:40] did they mess something up with the
[41:42] number yeah exactly
[41:45] yeah H really really cool uh massive
[41:49] yeah I think there's a lot of adoption
[41:50] coming along there's a lot of things
[41:52] happening and you had a lot of Bitcoin
[41:54] uh conferences also I liked it a lot
[41:56] what is your next conference that you're
[41:58] looking at is is there some some plan
[42:00] already in well I'm definitely going
[42:02] regularly to the Bitcoin meetups um yeah
[42:06] I I just checked so there's a lot
[42:09] actually going on in in South America
[42:11] which I'm probably I'm unfortunately not
[42:13] able to attend I don't actually know yet
[42:15] I will definitely go to BTC Prague but
[42:19] that's still one year ahead I'm I'm I'm
[42:21] still researching but
[42:24] uh the the I will have to miss a couple
[42:27] of U couple of conferences this year
[42:31] it's interesting when when you think
[42:32] about this whole game theory thing
[42:34] because it might be that uh the
[42:38] countries that are now looking really
[42:41] good and people want to go there and
[42:42] they have a really big uh pull factor
[42:45] might be not the countries that have a
[42:47] big pull factor in like 50 years because
[42:51] they are kind of convenient in their
[42:53] place and they're like ah we don't want
[42:55] that we don't want that that and in the
[42:57] time Nigeria Africa El Salvador uh
[43:01] Argentina all those countries are really
[43:04] like having a Crossroads movement of
[43:06] Bitcoin and they're adopting it and
[43:08] meanwhile in Germany meanwhile in
[43:10] Austria we like I don't know it's a
[43:12] luxury thing we don't need it is
[43:13] volatile yeah yeah it's uh what I kind
[43:17] of expect too I mean there needs to be
[43:20] be more pain and there's not enough pain
[43:23] here apparently yet to really adopt
[43:25] changes um so yeah we we I don't think
[43:29] the biggest adoption is going to happen
[43:31] here but well let's see let's see
[43:35] absolutely will be interesting uh to
[43:38] find out what's your what's your I think
[43:40] we also talked about the future um
[43:43] adoption what do you expect on the fact
[43:45] Microsoft we also talked about a little
[43:46] bit now it slowly comes back to our
[43:49] conversation uh what do you expect over
[43:51] the the the next couple of
[43:54] years yeah that's what I try to uh say I
[43:57] mean I I don't think well I expected the
[44:00] adoption to be slower but I I expected
[44:03] the the impact on the price be more
[44:06] drastic so I was really
[44:08] wondering we had such uh major changes
[44:11] and like the the spot ETFs and so forth
[44:16] that I thought uh it would um show in
[44:20] the price more clearly so in general I'm
[44:23] very bullish um I'm very hopeful um also
[44:27] think that's our shot you know to change
[44:31] stuff also with Noster you know um I'm
[44:35] starting to get more and more into
[44:36] Noster how do you like it is is is it
[44:39] good for
[44:40] you yeah that's like the social the
[44:43] Bitcoin of social media right and I I've
[44:46] did this I did this survey in in
[44:48] Amsterdam where I asked uh people um
[44:50] Noster in 2024 is like Bitcoin in 2012 I
[44:54] think I asked you the same question and
[44:56] then are you on Noster yet and like
[44:59] everyone knew Noster and I think most
[45:01] people were Noster with the exception of
[45:03] one or two
[45:05] people but yeah the ux is really not
[45:09] good uh it's it could there's a lot of
[45:12] improvement that has to be done but yeah
[45:15] that's probably was the case or
[45:17] certainly was the case with Bitcoin back
[45:19] then as well
[45:20] so um many people are like well if I
[45:24] would have had the opportunity to get
[45:26] into Bitcoin earlier uh then they would
[45:29] have done that of course and me myself
[45:31] also I knew about Bitcoin right from the
[45:33] beginning I think 2010 but I it took me
[45:36] nine years like 2019 to actually really
[45:40] do something and but now we have Noster
[45:44] and we we have the chance especially if
[45:46] you're
[45:47] into uh freedom of speech if you want to
[45:51] um yeah if
[45:53] you're it it'll I'm I'm sure it'll play
[45:56] a big role and now you have the CH
[45:58] chance uh to be first mover right and
[46:01] have a first mover Advantage um so yeah
[46:05] I want to get into that um I'm I'm
[46:07] meeting I'm going to the Noster meetups
[46:09] the second one the first one that were
[46:11] in Berlin were maybe five six people and
[46:16] the second one a month later the the
[46:18] room was already so full were maybe 30
[46:20] plus people and some people had to look
[46:23] uh watch from outside U because yeah was
[46:28] much better attended than the first time
[46:31] um and especially with current
[46:33] developments you know all the censorship
[46:35] and and and and chat control um I think
[46:40] um yeah we should all I hope to I hope
[46:45] for us all to con connect on Noster at
[46:48] some point even though it's it's it
[46:50] doesn't have the best user experience at
[46:53] at the moment yeah it's the one thing
[46:56] that is is different it doesn't have a
[47:00] clear Financial incentives there is of
[47:02] course uh if if nosto becomes the main
[47:06] protocol uh and you're building now an
[47:08] audience there you might be financially
[47:11] rewarded down the line if a lot of
[47:12] people come there and then uh pay you a
[47:15] lot for for making posts but you still
[47:17] have to like make posts uh for for that
[47:22] uh that's the one thing where I'm like
[47:24] that's that's different and I'm I'm
[47:26] really looking forward how how this pans
[47:29] out because a Bitcoin is was for a long
[47:33] time and for some it still is a pain to
[47:36] adopt and and figure out how to do it
[47:39] with keys and how to do with self
[47:41] custody but there's such a big Financial
[47:44] incentive there because it's such a
[47:47] great asset that uh push up your
[47:49] purchasing power with uh Nostra most
[47:54] people are like I already like
[47:57] only a handful of people actually
[48:01] experiences uh those freedom of speech
[48:05] big issues like most people just like oh
[48:08] they have like on Instagram stories a
[48:10] few stories about their lives they don't
[48:13] really care if if Instagram is is uh
[48:16] pushing topics down so what I think
[48:20] maybe if we have big big freedom of
[48:24] speech instances where there actually
[48:27] Banning a lot uh that might help that
[48:30] whole thing but then we have ax and El
[48:32] musk that is pushing that narrative uh
[48:34] and he's already uh forcing YouTube and
[48:39] forcing other platforms to be more
[48:40] freedom speech loving because now
[48:42] YouTube and Google and Facebook you know
[48:44] like own [ __ ] that there there is X and
[48:46] people go there uh if we do weird stuff
[48:49] on YouTube and Facebook so I'm really
[48:52] like that Nostra is something extremely
[48:55] fascinating to to watch and I myself am
[48:58] now since this year in on Nostra I tried
[49:01] it one year before that and one year
[49:04] before that I opened it I used it and I
[49:08] was like that's so bad no no Normie will
[49:11] ever do that it's such a bad experiences
[49:14] and there's no Financial incentive now
[49:17] the experience final sorry sorry what do
[49:20] you mean by Financial
[49:21] incentive the financial incentive so if
[49:24] you bought Bitcoin at 2010 and you just
[49:27] hold it you are hilariously rich now if
[49:30] you open now an nostr account and don't
[49:33] do anything with that you're not
[49:35] hilariously rich in 10 years that's true
[49:37] that's correct yeah but what I find F
[49:40] fascinating is
[49:41] that uh you can get sapped I mean the
[49:44] first zp which I just recently got was
[49:47] like amazing uh experience for me and
[49:51] and you know in on other platforms you
[49:55] um you have marketing companies um
[49:58] putting ads and there will probably also
[50:01] be ads on Noster but it's basically
[50:04] running you can get compensated without
[50:07] any ads right so you they're zapping
[50:10] each other for interesting content and
[50:13] the
[50:13] whole yeah ad structure that you see on
[50:16] YouTube or on X is not really there and
[50:19] maybe not even necessary in that sense
[50:21] so that's kind of interesting I think
[50:23] and it's true X is proba the most
[50:28] free freedom of speech platform but I
[50:31] mean most of the the thought exchange
[50:34] nowadays happens online and in most
[50:37] cases on the platform of private
[50:40] companies so that's actually also kind
[50:42] of weird right to because at the end of
[50:46] the day they control the algorithm I
[50:48] think we should even have we should even
[50:50] be able to make our own algorithm
[50:53] because if I have if I subscribe to over
[50:57] the years to a thousand YouTube channels
[50:59] or to a thousand people on Twitter it's
[51:03] still the platform that decides what I
[51:05] get to see and I'm actually I want to be
[51:08] able to control that you know because
[51:11] then there's still kind of
[51:14] yeah deciding what's important to see or
[51:17] not for me and I I prefer that to be
[51:19] completely uh transparent so I built my
[51:21] own
[51:23] algorithm uh to get the message that I
[51:25] want to see and maybe that's going to be
[51:28] possible on Noster at some point and the
[51:30] idea that you have a private key and and
[51:33] you lock into something and um own your
[51:37] identity own your thoughts own your
[51:39] speech is kind of very interesting and
[51:41] also very uh relevant I think nowadays
[51:44] because we've seen it uh on YouTube I
[51:47] Love YouTube you know I love Twitter I
[51:49] love YouTube but there's been so much uh
[51:52] censorship and just channels being um
[51:56] deleted needed U for yeah no reasonable
[52:00] reason I think in many cases that uh
[52:03] yeah I think Noster could be an answer
[52:05] but of course A lot has to happen still
[52:08] um yeah but I'm trying to become more
[52:11] active um when I post I often think and
[52:15] I also start doing it that I post first
[52:18] on Noster and then afterwards post it on
[52:21] Twitter maybe and but give Noster the
[52:24] priority but uh absolutely a lot has to
[52:28] be done also like with private keys
[52:30] right at some point if you get a really
[52:33] um like an influencer account it's it's
[52:35] it's your identity that could be stolen
[52:37] right and you don't um really have uh
[52:41] the security with with Bitcoin wallets
[52:44] right that you can sign into your
[52:48] profile um while not revealing your keys
[52:54] to on a laptop that is connected to the
[52:56] internet you
[52:57] know um so yeah let's see how that plays
[53:00] out I I would love to see it I see a lot
[53:03] of challenges along the way but I would
[53:05] love to see noso being the protocol and
[53:08] then you can just use whatever client
[53:10] you want to use I had an amazing oh my
[53:14] God moment with Nostra once I pluged in
[53:19] my uh Fountain to Nostra because all of
[53:23] the sudden now if I'm on Fountain and
[53:26] replying to people's activity on the
[53:29] fountain app it shows up on my Primal
[53:32] app and this is like oh like that's
[53:35] fascinating it's like you I reply to
[53:38] someone on YouTube and it shows up on a
[53:41] like that kind of moment and if we get
[53:45] to a point where the
[53:47] Nostra uh Network effect is so strong
[53:51] that Twitter YouTube Facebook have to
[53:54] adopt it like I think they will not
[53:55] vanish the the if if if noso gets so
[53:58] strong they they will adopt it or if
[54:02] they don't adopt it and noso get so
[54:03] strong they will die uh but if they're
[54:06] clever they will just adopt it um and
[54:09] figure out advertising models on Nostra
[54:11] because it's still possible and I think
[54:13] even that people actually are working on
[54:15] on that right now uh so it's it's super
[54:19] interesting to see um the only thing
[54:22] that I'm always urging people to do
[54:26] not don't hide on Nostra like like we
[54:30] need people uh on Twitter on Instagram
[54:34] on Tik Tok on YouTube to be active
[54:37] Bitcoin Advocates if you're active and
[54:40] Bitcoin Advocate don't just like oh like
[54:42] let's put everything on Nostra and don't
[54:45] interact with the normies
[54:47] like like we we need the digital solders
[54:51] where the the normies are and not where
[54:54] only bitcoiners are it's great that we
[54:56] have that space uh but we should not
[54:58] hide in an echo chamber uh we should go
[55:01] out there and and actually discuss with
[55:03] people why Bitcoin uh I don't have any
[55:07] fear that this happens I just want to
[55:10] put a message out there that people
[55:12] should not hide uh from the normies uh
[55:15] because uh the Nostra gives now an exit
[55:20] yeah I agree I mean um I I started to
[55:24] like put at the end of some messages
[55:26] that um I still like to connect on
[55:28] Noster so pull them in from all the
[55:31] other platforms into Noster that would
[55:33] be great but yeah but I also see other
[55:36] people who actually did only go to
[55:39] Noster and they also have success with
[55:43] that strategy you know um they they have
[55:46] a big following there and yeah I mean if
[55:48] they want to do it that way that's fine
[55:50] with me too but I'm on your side uh we
[55:53] still have to be on the other platforms
[55:56] and um get in touch with the normies
[55:59] yeah absolutely very very true perfect
[56:02] then let's come to uh closer to the end
[56:04] routine of of of the podcast um one
[56:07] question that I always ask my guest is
[56:09] what can we learn from you besides
[56:12] Bitcoin for me yes like whatever you
[56:15] want to share uh a skill a hobby uh uh
[56:20] and and and and insight learning
[56:23] whatever you want to to have like what
[56:25] you want to share with the audience
[56:27] besides Bitcoin
[56:30] things interesting I wasn't prepared for
[56:32] that um that's the one question that
[56:35] most uh guests are like oh let me think
[56:39] Super interesting you have like a on
[56:41] hour conversation like it's it flows
[56:43] extremely nicely uh and uh and the guest
[56:46] is like giving answers answers answers
[56:48] and then it's like oh wait outside of
[56:50] Bitcoin I don't do anything of Bitcoin
[56:52] but I I really want to get this uh this
[56:56] part in in the podcast because of two
[56:58] reasons first of all I want to get my
[56:59] guests better uh get to know my best
[57:02] guests better and second I think Bitcoin
[57:06] will at some point be extremely boring
[57:10] uh so we bitcoiners
[57:13] should uh we shouldn't make our whole
[57:16] identity around Bitcoin because at some
[57:18] point it's like making your whole
[57:20] identity around the TCP IP protocol like
[57:23] that's not sexy
[57:26] true I mean um yeah I do have other
[57:29] hobbies
[57:30] and when Bitcoin is a rabbit hole a deep
[57:34] Rabbit Hole you could go into you could
[57:38] also uh go into the jiujitsu rabbit hole
[57:41] you know I I do MMA and Jiu-Jitsu and um
[57:46] there was this um MMA fighter Renato Mo
[57:50] moano I don't know if have you ever seen
[57:52] his speech after a fight where he's last
[57:55] time he said
[57:57] uh [ __ ] Marco and this and that and then
[58:00] please read that book about Austrian
[58:02] economics from Hans Hamman Hopper and um
[58:06] I actually uh was trying to interview
[58:10] him not sure if that will still be
[58:12] possible but yeah that's
[58:14] also yeah I'm not sure if in what ways
[58:17] you can connect them to each other but I
[58:19] do jiujitsu and I could teach people
[58:22] about it and uh that's also very
[58:24] interesting Rabbit Hole um to go down
[58:28] and yeah
[58:30] that's something for me that maybe some
[58:34] people can learn something about and in
[58:37] general I think um it's always about
[58:41] staying critical questioning things in
[58:44] general um but be flexible in your mind
[58:48] but also persistent in your in your
[58:52] conviction and and and don't get crazy
[58:55] during these crazy times because there
[58:58] is light at the end of the tunnel and um
[59:01] um a lot of good things can
[59:03] happen amazing I love that a lot really
[59:07] cool um let's come to to the end of the
[59:10] podcast where the previous guest is
[59:11] asking a question for the next guest
[59:13] without knowing who the next guest
[59:14] actually is um your question from the
[59:16] previous guest is a two-p parted
[59:19] question I think the first uh answer I
[59:22] already know have you lowered your time
[59:24] preference since you adopted
[59:26] coin yeah the second
[59:30] question is H what impact uh did it have
[59:34] that you lowered your time preference on
[59:37] on your life yeah well you look uh you
[59:41] live more
[59:42] minimalistic um
[59:44] you make more thorough decisions about
[59:47] what you really need to buy and what you
[59:49] don't need to
[59:50] buy um and
[59:53] that Bitcoin taught me that um um maybe
[59:57] it's also my age may also together with
[59:59] my experience but uh yeah I'm a I'm a
[60:04] hotler and
[60:05] um yeah Bitcoin taught me that so
[60:09] yes super interesting super interesting
