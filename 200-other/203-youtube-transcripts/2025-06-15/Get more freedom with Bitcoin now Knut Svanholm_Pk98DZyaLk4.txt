[00:00] all all tools and technologies that
[00:02] Humanity ever invented have one and the
[00:04] same single purpose and that is to save
[00:06] someone time somewhere and Bitcoin to me
[00:09] is the ultimate tool for time saving the
[00:11] legal system is not necessarily a lawful
[00:13] system a lawful system would be that
[00:15] where property rights were always
[00:17] respected at one point I left my
[00:18] managerial job and just and did this
[00:21] instead so that sends a signal to
[00:23] everyone else in that office that that
[00:25] guy just left because he could the
[00:27] longer you keep your integrity and
[00:28] remain truthful to your yourself and to
[00:30] others and provide them with value the
[00:32] higher the chances that you will get
[00:34] something back from
[00:35] it you were sailing before making music
[00:40] how did you transition from like that
[00:42] career that's a little bit different uh
[00:45] to to writing about Bitcoin and being an
[00:47] auor uh and speaking about Bitcoin how
[00:50] did you transition from from that to to
[00:52] here where you're now with podcasting
[00:54] and
[00:55] writing yeah um I was my my sailing
[00:59] career um ended when I when I started a
[01:03] family and I needed a job that was
[01:06] didn't require me to to just uh [ __ ] off
[01:10] for two months I can swear on this pod
[01:12] right of course this is yeah yeah it's
[01:14] highly
[01:16] recommended so yeah yeah yeah um
[01:19] Christine lagard uh
[01:22] anyway um so so I got um another job
[01:26] with still on boats but um shorter turn
[01:30] so we did two weeks on two weeks off and
[01:33] that's what led me into the office of
[01:35] this uh offshore um shipping company uh
[01:39] where my my last Fiat job I say last
[01:43] instead of latest but last was as an HR
[01:46] Manager for that company so I did like
[01:48] eight years on the toll ship and then
[01:50] eight years in this
[01:52] wind uh crew transfer vessel
[01:57] um um Shipping Company the the the
[02:01] main the main business of the company
[02:04] was to provide crew transfers out back
[02:07] and forth to wind farms in the Baltic
[02:09] Sea and the North Sea so I yeah and the
[02:13] first I was a captain just shipping
[02:15] shipping these people out U Back and
[02:18] forth to the to the turbines to do
[02:20] reparations or whatever or or some
[02:22] contracts were building contracts and
[02:24] other contracts were you know
[02:25] maintenance
[02:27] contracts and after that I started in
[02:29] the office uh you know coordinating
[02:32] Crews and later on climbing up the
[02:34] letters to become a a
[02:36] manager uh and it was during that time
[02:40] that I I wrote uh in the office when I
[02:44] had a lot to do I I I wrote the first
[02:48] book like uh but but before that when I
[02:51] was at one of the wind farms I um I
[02:53] started writing articles because then I
[02:55] had a lot of spare time because one one
[02:58] job we had was with uh people who hung
[03:01] from the nozzle and down the wing to
[03:04] inspect the wing of the wind turbine and
[03:07] that job was just driving them out into
[03:09] the to the farm or the park the the wind
[03:12] farm and then dropping them off and
[03:15] moing to another turbine and just being
[03:18] staying standby for 10 hours and of
[03:22] course there was some some stuff to do
[03:24] with a with a boat like you know
[03:26] checking oil levels and and filling in
[03:28] forms and whatever
[03:30] um but when all that was done it took
[03:32] about half an hour I had nothing to do
[03:35] for 9 and a half hours so like or maybe
[03:38] nine hours but uh so and I got bored
[03:41] with all the games on my phone and the
[03:43] internet connection was crap out there
[03:45] and at C anyway so I decided to start
[03:48] writing articles because I had just
[03:50] taken a course in digital
[03:53] currencies plural
[03:55] form um online course at the University
[03:59] of NC
[04:01] uh I think the the course is still there
[04:03] but it's too [ __ ]
[04:04] coiny uh but yeah so I I I sort of
[04:10] wanted to find a way to utilize that new
[04:13] found knowledge of mine and U decided to
[04:15] use it for writing so I started writing
[04:18] articles and then they sort of took off
[04:21] so I decided to write a book uh with the
[04:23] first book was just a compilation of
[04:25] Articles uh I didn't really like that
[04:28] because then that's the only book I had
[04:29] to my name so I decided to write
[04:32] sovereignty through mathematics which is
[04:34] my first proper book
[04:38] um and um yeah the the rest is sort of
[04:42] History I went to um to Ria to the
[04:44] Baltic honeyb you conference in 2019 and
[04:48] uh brought 50 copies of the book gave
[04:51] them out and gave out half of them to
[04:53] important bitcoiners and sold the rest
[04:56] and uh then the book sort of took took
[04:58] off and um I got invited to pods and
[05:01] invited to do more things so I did more
[05:04] and more Bitcoin things and then at one
[05:06] point I wrote an article with a sentence
[05:08] everything divided by 21 million in it
[05:10] and then that sort of became a
[05:12] thing uh the infinity divided meme um
[05:17] became a thing after the um after we
[05:20] made a I made a video with yon appleberg
[05:23] the animator about uh about that or from
[05:27] that
[05:28] article uh and then that that
[05:31] visualization of that sentence this
[05:33] thing on my t-shirt here that that
[05:35] completely took off and uh all of a
[05:38] sudden everyone on Twitter was adding
[05:40] into to their handles and uh now I have
[05:43] a folder with a subfolder in it on my
[05:46] computer saying tattoos and it's the the
[05:49] folder is pictures of the equation from
[05:51] around the globe and the subfolder is
[05:53] tattoos so there's like a around 30
[05:56] pictures at this point of different
[05:58] people having tattooed the thing into
[05:59] their
[06:00] to their bodies so yeah life took a
[06:03] weird turn and uh around when these
[06:06] things happen I decided at some point to
[06:09] uh because I could see my Fiat career
[06:11] going nowhere uh since inflation was
[06:14] eating all of the races I got so so uh
[06:19] like uh so I felt like in you know that
[06:22] scene in office space when he realizes
[06:24] that every day of his life is is the
[06:27] worst day of his life because each day
[06:28] is increasing L
[06:31] worse I wouldn't say that was the case
[06:33] for me but still I could see like
[06:35] economically it sort of was because of
[06:37] the um inflation eating all of the
[06:41] whenever I got a race um still I had
[06:43] some Bitcoin and I had this thing going
[06:46] so U at one point I just decided to quit
[06:50] and move down here to Spain to our
[06:51] holiday home here and do Bitcoin stuff
[06:55] full time and I'm still trying to figure
[06:58] out what that is uh of course it
[07:00] includes more writing in doing the Pod
[07:02] and yeah doing this fabulous
[07:05] wine some other stuff going to
[07:08] conferences and you know I'm just
[07:10] throwing things at the wall to see what
[07:12] sticks and um um enjoying myself so yeah
[07:16] and very happy to be uh in a position
[07:20] where I can make a living off of just
[07:22] doing whatever I
[07:24] want that's that's really
[07:27] cool you're the second B coin who
[07:30] produces wine I had Ben jman also on I
[07:33] think a few weeks ago that's oh you did
[07:36] yeah yeah I never met him but uh yeah uh
[07:38] I'm interested in his wine and I think
[07:40] he's interested in mine too I mean I'm
[07:42] not a big wine guy I I got to know a
[07:45] wine maker down here and uh after a
[07:49] while we figured out that we could
[07:50] collaborate and maybe if we could brand
[07:53] it with this that it would be mut
[07:55] beneficial so we did and we tried out
[07:58] different wines and came up with what I
[08:01] think is the Perfect Blend it's it's the
[08:03] best wine I ever tasted in my life and
[08:05] um
[08:07] yeah whatever that's worth yeah it seems
[08:11] like when you wrote the articles and
[08:13] then you transition also to the books
[08:15] that you were on still on a Learning
[08:18] Journey uh in Bitcoin uh because I guess
[08:20] you used the time for Learning and
[08:23] writing the Articles so you I guess with
[08:25] the first articles and the book you
[08:27] learned a lot about Bitcoin or did you
[08:29] like had most before Oh I think The
[08:34] Learning Journey never ends for anyone I
[08:37] think we're all on a Learning Journey
[08:39] and that never stops like there's always
[08:41] more stuff to learn uh the rabbit hole
[08:44] is endless uh so so yeah yeah of course
[08:48] I'm learning all the time like doing the
[08:50] Pod I learn a lot from just talking to
[08:53] people like the intricacies of mining
[08:55] for instance that I wasn't very informed
[08:58] about before and like like there there's
[09:01] so much to learn and not only about
[09:03] Bitcoin but you know economics
[09:06] philosophy mathematics this this you
[09:08] know there's so many tangent subjects so
[09:12] you can always be more knowledgeable
[09:15] um that's the way I see it yeah that's
[09:19] uh I just started like I'm really new to
[09:21] the podcast like it started in in in
[09:23] November December I have now my 54th
[09:26] recording with you uh and it's
[09:28] interesting how you have so many
[09:31] different guests on and you learn from
[09:33] everyone something new that you didn't
[09:35] know before and it's like it it humbles
[09:37] you every time because you you think you
[09:39] studied so many books you think you
[09:40] studied so many hours of Bitcoin and
[09:43] then there's a new person coming and
[09:44] you're like oh [ __ ] I never thought
[09:46] about that aspect before and you always
[09:48] learn something new in it yeah one thing
[09:51] I figured out about myself during life
[09:55] like I'm I'm pushing 50 now I'm 47 so
[09:57] like uh if there's any wisdom there it's
[10:01] like uh it's this thing how much I enjoy
[10:05] just becoming trying to become better at
[10:08] a certain thing like so improving a
[10:11] skill I really enjoy the process of that
[10:13] and and the more the older you get the
[10:16] less you
[10:18] know uh what's the word you you can be
[10:23] embarrassed for not being good enough so
[10:25] you have too much self-criticism so too
[10:28] much self-criticism isn't isn't very
[10:30] productive because you never get
[10:32] anywhere but you have to have
[10:34] self-criticism like if you don't you
[10:37] never get better at anything so you have
[10:39] to find a balance there uh where where
[10:43] you want to be on the self-criticism
[10:45] scale and there was a tip from Trey
[10:47] Parker the creator of South Park uh he
[10:50] said that you should always aim for 95%
[10:54] Perfection because the last 5% aren't
[10:56] going to give you any value like uh
[10:59] long-term value you need to get the
[11:01] stuff out there if you're 95% happy with
[11:04] it it's fine like nobody else is going
[11:06] to notice the flaws in it and you could
[11:08] spend two more months doing a thing and
[11:10] it would become 5% better like the the
[11:13] diminishing returns you know so uh so
[11:17] aim for 95% Perfection and and that's
[11:20] what I tried to do and I I think that's
[11:22] why you keep the momentum and like right
[11:24] now I love trying to be a a good
[11:27] interviewer for instance like that a
[11:29] skill I never had before I never tried
[11:31] to be an interviewer I never tried
[11:34] journalism for lack of a better word or
[11:36] pretentious blogging or whatever you
[11:38] call it these days but um but it's a
[11:42] good it it but I enjoy trying to be
[11:46] better because being a better
[11:48] interviewer is just being a better
[11:50] listener I guess and uh I I realized a
[11:54] couple of things about myself that I I
[11:57] interrupt too much like that's the first
[11:59] thing you notice when you start to do
[12:02] pods right because you can hear yourself
[12:04] interrupting the guest and like oh okay
[12:06] maybe I should do that a bit less uh
[12:10] so yeah but as I said I enjoy trying to
[12:15] get better at stuff it's up to others to
[12:18] to judge if I actually get better at
[12:20] stuff but but still I enjoy the
[12:22] process yeah with with the interruption
[12:25] it's it's uh interesting because when uh
[12:29] the guest speaks especially if they are
[12:31] like really good in in speaking they
[12:33] usually go on for a longer period of
[12:35] time and making a bigger point and then
[12:37] there's like so many interesting points
[12:39] in between where you want to like jump
[12:41] in and you have to be like let's let's
[12:44] let him finish and let the let F finish
[12:46] and then go on from that and it's it was
[12:49] also I struggled a lot with that I'm
[12:50] still struggling with that I think um
[12:53] yeah and I I I think that that's due to
[12:56] a lot of bitcoiners having some touch of
[12:59] add you know and but you you get a
[13:02] thought and you I definitely do and then
[13:05] as as soon as a thought pops into my
[13:07] head I know I have to act on the thought
[13:09] otherwise I forget whatever was on my
[13:11] mind so I I can be very eager to
[13:14] interrupt people just because I get a
[13:16] thought in my head yeah I have a tactic
[13:18] for that I have always right here on my
[13:21] screen and Sheet open and when I think
[13:24] it's really interesting I want to come
[13:26] back to that for I just write it quickly
[13:28] down like two words and it's it's hard
[13:31] to to do that but I learned to just
[13:34] write it down because I 100% as you said
[13:37] I forget it 100% I don't know what I
[13:39] wanted to say I I couldn't write it down
[13:42] because that would mean I would lose my
[13:43] train of thought completely if I started
[13:45] writing it down and I would I would lose
[13:48] my attention listening to the guest and
[13:50] every yeah so I couldn't do that I never
[13:52] I was never good at taking
[13:54] notes yeah it's it's for me
[13:57] unfortunately it's necessary
[13:59] yeah and coming back it would be good if
[14:01] it could but anyway yeah yeah coming
[14:05] back to to the thought that I am
[14:08] actually wrote down where you talked
[14:10] about getting better and uh your show is
[14:13] also called Freedom footprint show yeah
[14:17] uh and I think you also me asked that
[14:21] your guests uh and I want to give you
[14:24] the that question to you also um with
[14:27] getting better and inre ining your own
[14:30] uh uh foot Freedom footprint um what do
[14:32] you do to increase it accept uh Bitcoin
[14:35] like accept from the obvious saving your
[14:38] money in Bitcoin and and and stuff like
[14:40] that what what would you recommend also
[14:42] to other people doing to increase your
[14:45] personal
[14:47] footprint well this such a multifaceted
[14:50] question that's a great question uh but
[14:53] uh what I try to learn about Freedom
[14:57] Tools in general and I try to to learn
[14:59] how to use them and then use them so so
[15:02] like I'm thinking a lot about like flag
[15:04] Theory and stuff I haven't I haven't
[15:07] gotten a second passport yet but I'm
[15:09] certainly looking into uh what you can
[15:13] and cannot do um when it comes to
[15:16] residency and and uh citizenship and
[15:18] stuff like that and how to avoid this
[15:21] and how to avoid that and try to see the
[15:24] legal system for what it is like the
[15:26] legal system is not necessarily a lawful
[15:28] system a lawful system would be that
[15:31] where every where property rights were
[15:33] always respected right um but a legal
[15:36] system instead of looking at it from the
[15:40] perspective of oh yeah I need to obey
[15:42] the law therefore I do this you could
[15:44] look it from a consequence analysis
[15:47] perspective like okay I I can do this or
[15:50] I can do that and the consequences are
[15:53] this or that and regardless of what they
[15:56] call those consequences what the
[15:58] bureaucrats call those consequences so
[16:00] so you have to and then you can do a
[16:01] little risk Matrix like is this is this
[16:05] uh good is this bad uh is this worth it
[16:07] is is it worth the tradeoff you know if
[16:11] I'm for in um a simple example would be
[16:15] okay I need to go over here from place a
[16:17] to place B uh point A to point B really
[16:21] fast but in doing that I would break the
[16:24] speed limit so is it worth it and then
[16:27] you have to ask your C s a couple of
[16:29] questions yeah if I get caught I have to
[16:31] pay this or that and I run a risk of
[16:34] losing my driver's license there's also
[16:36] the risk of it being morally wrong which
[16:38] it is if you kill someone accidentally
[16:41] but if you're confident enough that you
[16:43] won't kill anyone then nothing should
[16:45] really prevent you from driving as fast
[16:47] as you want because like as long as it
[16:50] doesn't hurt anyone else it's not really
[16:51] a crime from a Libertarian perspective
[16:55] so um so you can do the analysis in your
[16:57] head is this worth it or not
[16:59] and that of course depends on whatever
[17:02] meeting you're trying to make it to so
[17:05] in most cases in in this scenario this
[17:07] is just the scenario I pulled out of my
[17:09] ass
[17:10] but in most cases you would probably
[17:12] just drive a little earlier to be on
[17:15] time U that that's probably the better
[17:17] trade-off but like with everything in
[17:20] life there's always a trade-off and you
[17:22] can choose to do one thing rather than
[17:24] another and I just realized that this is
[17:27] a very very convoluted way to answer the
[17:29] question how are you increasing your
[17:31] freedom footprint but um anyway I'm I'm
[17:35] thinking about it all the time and I'm
[17:36] thinking what can I do and what what is
[17:39] a good idea and what is a bad idea and
[17:42] uh how does it increase like just just
[17:44] applying that lens how does this action
[17:47] increase my long-term Freedom like how
[17:50] does this benefit me 10 years ahead 10
[17:54] years down the line how does this
[17:56] increase my family's freedom
[17:59] yeah when we come back to that street
[18:02] example where like when you want to
[18:04] increase your freedom and you're going
[18:06] through the streets faster because um
[18:09] you were like oh it's it's it's my
[18:11] choice and I want to be more free so I
[18:13] drive uh with the speed limit I set
[18:17] myself and then when you run into like
[18:19] oh I killed someone because of that
[18:22] wrong action you still increased your
[18:25] own Freedom footprint to a certain
[18:27] extent I guess uh but you decreased the
[18:30] freedom fpr of someone else because
[18:33] maybe that person suffered it's like
[18:35] increasing your own personal freedom
[18:38] footprint um uh always or sometimes
[18:41] decreasing someone's
[18:43] else's yes it it reduces the overall
[18:47] Freedom dioxide levels of the earth so
[18:50] that's so so and that's something you
[18:53] shouldn't do you should you should try
[18:54] to maximize the all the freedom dioxide
[18:57] levels and not just your own Freedom
[18:59] footprint so that's the ethical
[19:01] standpoint here I think what's the
[19:04] freedom dioxy level well it's instead of
[19:08] saying carbon dioxide I say freedom
[19:10] dioxide as like a metaphor for for the
[19:13] the to prevent Global laming we need to
[19:17] emit more freedom dioxide that's the
[19:19] thing so so well the the example of the
[19:22] speeding car might be a bad example this
[19:24] could be like okay if I don't pay this
[19:27] tax on time here I um I have to pay a
[19:31] fee or I run at risk at paying a fee but
[19:34] I know exactly what the fee is and it
[19:37] might be worth the risk because I might
[19:39] get a return on investment that is you
[19:42] know larger than what it cost me to pay
[19:45] the fee so you can always do this uh
[19:48] consequence analysis thing when thinking
[19:50] about it doesn't it doesn't have to be
[19:53] limited to Le a legal framework it could
[19:57] be anything in life there's always
[19:58] tradeoff right you choose to do one
[20:00] thing that means you don't do the other
[20:02] thing that you could have done so like I
[20:04] think if if you do that from a freedom
[20:07] perspective uh all the time then I guess
[20:11] that's that's like the basics of
[20:14] increasing your freedom footprint and
[20:15] the the more I do this stuff and
[20:17] like I'm at a position in life now where
[20:21] I most of the things I do every day I do
[20:24] completely voluntary and uh voluntarily
[20:27] and no one's forcing me to do any of
[20:30] this stuff so uh of course i' I'd like
[20:34] for the numbers to be for the figures on
[20:36] the balance sheet to be black rather
[20:38] than red and to make money off of stuff
[20:41] but it's not the only factor I I just
[20:44] love having the freedom to wake up every
[20:47] morning and be myself and do whatever I
[20:50] want with my time um so so that's what
[20:54] I'm striving for and that's what I'm
[20:55] trying to achieve uh yeah it also goes
[20:58] in the the section where you try to find
[21:01] Truth uh and Truth in yourself and and
[21:04] being true to yourself because if you're
[21:05] forced to do something every day you
[21:07] actually don't want to do you're
[21:09] actually not true to yourself of course
[21:11] you're also not free like you can tackle
[21:13] this from a lot of different Angels yeah
[21:15] but you're not true to yourself and not
[21:17] true to the environment around you and
[21:21] you also talked about the transition
[21:23] time from where you had the normal
[21:26] normal fear job uh and transition to the
[21:30] O I go full on bitcoin and you I guess
[21:32] you're self-employed and having a small
[21:35] company at first and then trying to do
[21:37] it um I actually go through that myself
[21:40] right now uh and that's why I wanted to
[21:43] ask you and and uh how how hard was it
[21:46] for you how did what was the experience
[21:48] right in the transition moment where you
[21:49] decided oh let's do it uh did you
[21:52] already had like um like an income
[21:55] Source from everything or did you just
[21:57] go in there was like let's let's try to
[21:59] make
[22:01] it well I had some savings both in Fiat
[22:04] and in um and in Bitcoin um so uh so I
[22:09] knew that I I would be set for for
[22:12] bootstrapping the whole thing
[22:15] and and at at some point I would get
[22:19] to to you know u a sound financial
[22:24] situation even though that might not
[22:27] have been the case in the beginning so
[22:29] and right now I just see it as building
[22:33] these these little Gardens of uh these
[22:37] little money- making machines every here
[22:39] and there uh and also like getting well
[22:44] connected is very underrated still like
[22:47] having a lots lots of Connections in the
[22:49] space and and seeing what you can do and
[22:52] I I think just providing other people
[22:56] with value will eventually
[22:58] benefit you as well and also Pro
[23:02] providing other people with value is
[23:05] valuable in itself it feels very good to
[23:07] to help people and to spread a message
[23:10] and to to try to be a good person
[23:13] um so there's there's inherent value in
[23:17] that to me uh
[23:20] and uh and I'm I believe that if you do
[23:24] that long enough and if people see that
[23:26] you're a good guy and uh that you're you
[23:28] value your integrity and you don't you
[23:31] know run off try to run off with a bag
[23:32] of [ __ ] coins and scam
[23:34] people the the longer you keep your
[23:37] integrity and remain truthful to
[23:39] yourself and to others and provide them
[23:41] with value the the the the higher the
[23:45] chances that you will get something back
[23:47] from it so so I think like of course it
[23:50] could be it's always good to to have a
[23:54] bit of a a
[23:55] stack regardless of what what what that
[23:58] stack consists of like to have something
[24:01] to fall back on before you before you
[24:03] try jump off the cliff and see if you
[24:05] can fly
[24:07] [Music]
[24:08] um so that helps certainly helps um but
[24:13] I think just just providing other people
[24:14] with value is a good good place to start
[24:18] and and see what happens yeah I guess
[24:20] also the feedback from uh the books and
[24:23] uh all the not not only the the
[24:27] financial Fe feedback you get from
[24:29] providing value but uh I guess there was
[24:32] there's also a lot of um emotional and a
[24:35] lot of just readers feedback from your
[24:38] writings from your books uh that you got
[24:41] there is there anything that's like uh
[24:43] that's stood out to you uh in the in the
[24:46] feedback is there any like readers
[24:48] feedback that was really influential
[24:50] maybe in like a later book or like a
[24:53] feedback that make you rethink your book
[24:55] or something like that and it uh stood
[24:58] out to you oh
[25:01] that's not a I I can't think of a big
[25:04] thing like that but there lots of
[25:06] smaller tips and tricks and criticisms
[25:09] that I I take to heart and try to change
[25:11] so like
[25:13] um uh one when I wrote everything
[25:16] divided I used a a um editor called um
[25:20] Hemingway I believe uh that uh suggests
[25:25] always suggests shorter sentences so the
[25:28] sentences are a bit a a bit on the short
[25:31] short side overall in that book and
[25:33] someone pointed it out to me and so so
[25:36] therefore like uh going forward uh and
[25:40] also working with different editors and
[25:41] stuff it helps my writing uh a lot to to
[25:45] to know when to override these
[25:47] suggestions that grammarly and the
[25:51] similar things give you so so that you
[25:53] you don't necessarily have to do what
[25:55] the computer tells you to do you could
[25:57] do something
[25:58] you you you can keep your own voice and
[26:00] your integrity by by knowing when to
[26:02] override it and uh like so so little
[26:05] tips and tricks like that that came from
[26:07] different sources I try to take it all
[26:09] in and and uh see what I can do with
[26:13] whatever information people give me I'm
[26:16] super excited to announce that this
[26:18] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[26:22] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[26:26] they teach and preach self cust this is
[26:29] my goto exchange when someone asks me oh
[26:32] where can I buy my Bitcoin from this is
[26:34] the easiest entry for bitcoiners and if
[26:38] you want lower fees Plus at the same
[26:40] time support this podcast use code Robin
[26:43] and click the link in the description I
[26:45] mean I guess it's really um I never
[26:48] wrote a book like the longest I wrote
[26:50] like an article that it's like read 5 to
[26:52] 10 minutes maybe um and even that I did
[26:56] rarely and I I know that I have to start
[26:58] writing more because it's like a thing
[27:01] where you actually learn a lot um uh I
[27:05] guess people told me that yeah writing
[27:08] is a timec consuming and tedious project
[27:12] uh process even even if you use a lot of
[27:15] chat GPT it still takes a hell of a lot
[27:17] of time if you want if you want to be
[27:19] proud of whatever you put out there you
[27:21] need to like double check everything
[27:23] always and and you need uh you need a
[27:26] good editor is very good to have
[27:29] and uh but writing is very good for if
[27:34] you want to be better at arguing or or
[27:37] debating or you know getting your point
[27:39] across then writing your thoughts down
[27:42] makes your speech more coherent like you
[27:46] get better at talking from writing and
[27:49] vice ver Versa the more interviews you
[27:51] do and the more you have to express
[27:53] yourself verbally the better you become
[27:55] at writing so it's like a uh self
[27:58] reinforcing thing so my writing helps my
[28:02] My Talking and vice versa how do you
[28:05] balance between uh consuming and
[28:07] producing like writing and talking and
[28:09] doing the interviews is like producing
[28:11] stuff you're also consuming because you
[28:13] listen to the guest I guess but how many
[28:16] podcasts and books uh like how how much
[28:19] do you balance from like producing
[28:21] versus consuming
[28:23] stuff well I consume stuff mostly when I
[28:28] when I drive so when I'm in the car I I
[28:31] always listen to
[28:33] something uh um more often than not when
[28:36] I'm on long walks which I try to take at
[28:39] least one every day uh I almost always
[28:43] listen to something if I'm not in a
[28:45] phone
[28:46] call um so I try to consume then again
[28:50] it's yeah you have to be picky because
[28:52] you have limited time on your hands so
[28:55] uh it is what it is sometimes I have to
[28:58] do research for the Pod like I have to
[29:00] listen to something that the the guest
[29:02] that is coming on uh the next day uh has
[29:05] done so that I'm not completely
[29:07] unfamiliar with the person and and as
[29:10] you know you have to do some some
[29:12] pre-work sometimes and yeah and yeah I
[29:17] spend a lot of time on on Twitter and
[29:19] Noster and and stuff like that and
[29:21] especially on Twitter uh since it's the
[29:23] bigger platform and I have the bigger
[29:25] following there um just
[29:29] seeing what people say um and try try to
[29:33] have my finger on the pulse of the
[29:35] community trying to be engaged in the
[29:39] the current thing I mean the current
[29:42] bitcoin thing um yeah so so I I consume
[29:47] a lot of content as well I do it can be
[29:51] actually really um like the finding a
[29:54] right balance uh for me at least it's
[29:56] really hard to find like oh
[29:58] how how much can I consume uh without
[30:02] just consuming the whole day with a
[30:04] podcast and Twitter scrolling and and
[30:06] then there's another book coming out and
[30:08] I should read that also but there's like
[30:10] a list of 30 books I actually want to
[30:12] read and there's a podcast coming out
[30:15] and I want this and that there's a lot
[30:17] of lot going on and can be really hectic
[30:19] but I guess the focus is is really
[30:21] important I guess you have to you have
[30:23] to find what works for you it's a very
[30:26] individual thing I think I think
[30:28] everyone's you know writing process and
[30:32] even listening process is different like
[30:34] some people need to listen over and over
[30:36] again to thing and some people can
[30:38] listen at five times the speed and stuff
[30:41] like that uh I can speed up books yeah
[30:45] yeah I can't do that I I I mean I can
[30:48] speed up to uh like 1.5 depending on
[30:51] who's reading the audiobook I can speed
[30:53] up to like between 125 and 175 but I
[30:57] never do
[30:58] over two because I I want the the words
[31:02] to sink in a bit so and yeah and also
[31:06] depends on if it's in the morning or in
[31:08] the evening I I mean sometimes you're
[31:10] better at taking in information I guess
[31:13] I'm pretty much a morning person yeah uh
[31:17] when we come back to uh Bitcoin and
[31:20] how's the the future going um I always
[31:23] wonder if um the role models in each
[31:27] sector for example like for companies it
[31:29] would be like kind of micro strategy to
[31:32] adopting a full Bitcoin standard for
[31:34] countries I guess it would be Salvador
[31:36] with adopting a Bitcoin standard I mean
[31:40] there different examples and there are
[31:42] different variations and every count in
[31:44] every company is different um do you see
[31:47] um nation state and and and Bitcoin comp
[31:50] and companies adopting Bitcoin and
[31:52] individuals taking the the Bitcoin
[31:54] standard route or is it like um
[31:58] how do you see Bitcoin proceeding the
[32:01] next like 10 15 years across the
[32:04] different sectors with Bitcoin companies
[32:07] and with uh nation
[32:10] states very hard to predict the future
[32:12] but but I'm certainly optimistic about
[32:14] it and I do think there's something to
[32:17] you know Bitcoin doesn't go to bitcoin
[32:20] whenever there's a bull market Bitcoin
[32:22] doesn't 2X and then pull back like
[32:25] Bitcoin 20 X's like so
[32:28] so I think the the likelihood of us
[32:31] landing somewhere around a million
[32:33] dollars per coin is is is almost higher
[32:36] than around
[32:37] 100,000 so probably will'll Peak at a
[32:40] million and then back to 600,000 or
[32:42] something that's to me that's seems like
[32:44] a more likely scenario than oh we'll
[32:46] just slowly and steadily go up to
[32:48] 100,000 and nothing happens we we
[32:52] because this foing effects you get from
[32:54] the media paying more attention to it is
[32:56] just enormous and like there are so many
[33:01] things that are not priced in so the way
[33:04] I see the Bitcoin price is like the the
[33:07] level you the thing to look for is the
[33:09] yearly lows and to see where that is
[33:12] trending and don't worry about the Peaks
[33:14] because the Peaks are just you know
[33:17] markets doing Market things uh and
[33:20] people speculating and then getting
[33:22] scared and selling off but underlying
[33:26] this ever increasing yearly lows is
[33:31] whenever there's a bull run a new
[33:33] generation of bitcoiners is born and a
[33:35] new generation of uh hodlers of L Resort
[33:39] are born that will never sell so so
[33:43] you're you're taking all these sets off
[33:45] the market and at the same time I don't
[33:47] think most people are not aware that 93%
[33:50] of the Bitcoins that will ever exist
[33:52] have already been mined so the first 15
[33:55] years we Min 93% of the total Supply
[33:58] that would ever exist the following 15
[34:00] years we will mine six six additional
[34:04] perc so the just the difference between
[34:07] those two numbers and like the the rest
[34:09] and 100 years from that it it'll be like
[34:13] the last
[34:14] 1% so sets are extremely scarce
[34:18] extremely finite and I think most people
[34:20] just can't WP their heads around how how
[34:23] rare they are and and so you have this
[34:27] finite Supply meets unlimited demand at
[34:30] some point or like like what's the upper
[34:33] limit of the demand it's just how much
[34:36] money people have uh but they can
[34:39] potentially throw all the money at
[34:41] Bitcoin at some point and with with each
[34:43] B bull run the the likelihood of a
[34:47] hyperbitcoinization type event happening
[34:50] increases because you have
[34:52] like so if I take myself as an example I
[34:56] I used to work in an office where
[34:59] uh around maybe 50 to 70 people worked
[35:04] and uh in a company with 300 employees
[35:07] and yes I was known as the Bitcoin guy
[35:09] in the office most people didn't want to
[35:11] talk about that very often and I didn't
[35:14] didn't actively try to push it down
[35:16] their shove it down their throats but at
[35:19] one point I left my managerial job and
[35:21] just [ __ ] off and did this
[35:23] instead so that sends a signal to
[35:26] everyone else in that office that holy
[35:27] [ __ ] that guy just left uh because he
[35:31] could uh so that's part of the intention
[35:35] um and like I'm just one guy in one
[35:39] office this can potentially happen in
[35:42] every office in the
[35:43] world and it is happening like the
[35:47] stories about people going full-time
[35:49] Bitcoin and uh doing Bitcoin stuff is is
[35:53] just
[35:54] everywhere and and like like look at the
[35:57] world to today as just compared to
[36:00] preco video conferencing was not a big
[36:04] thing
[36:05] preo like it was more common to to give
[36:08] someone a phone call or send an email
[36:10] right now everyone's doing video calls
[36:12] all the time because we had to adapt to
[36:14] that during but think of how recent that
[36:17] is so now we can look each other in the
[36:20] eye and have a non- laggy conversation
[36:23] with anyone on Earth at any point and we
[36:26] can reach anyone we want through social
[36:28] media
[36:30] platforms uh and we have Bitcoin so we
[36:32] have borderless money borderless
[36:34] Communications borderless everything uh
[36:38] so so all of the other all of the Legacy
[36:40] structures are already obsolete you just
[36:43] you just either you're living in the
[36:45] future or you're not a company is
[36:48] nothing more than a telegram group at
[36:50] this point you don't need to do all the
[36:53] bureau bureaucracy you don't even need
[36:55] accounting you don't need anything like
[36:56] that you just need
[36:59] an some way to receive and send Bitcoin
[37:03] and you know some chat room that's all a
[37:08] company is now there's nothing more
[37:10] there's nothing more to it anyone can do
[37:13] anything and that world is so much
[37:15] better to live in it's just that most
[37:17] people live in the past and not in the
[37:19] future or not in right now which it's
[37:22] the future by the way because it's the
[37:23] 2000s so that has always been the future
[37:27] uh
[37:28] I also think that the example of you
[37:30] living the the the office isn't a great
[37:33] one I had a talk on the spaces on on
[37:36] Thursday where we talked about how to
[37:38] best orange build someone and we kind of
[37:41] came to the conclusion that the best
[37:43] orange building you can possibly do in
[37:45] your personal life is living an amazing
[37:47] life and telling people uh that you are
[37:52] a bitcoiner and then Bitcoin then people
[37:55] like he's a bitcoiner and he an amazing
[37:58] life he's just like free he's doing what
[38:00] he wants to do and being like yourself
[38:04] and being free and being just happy in
[38:06] life and and people seeing if you're
[38:09] actually happy or just like yeah
[38:13] feared official happy that's I think the
[38:18] most effective way to to Orange Bill
[38:21] someone just being a good person and
[38:25] living a happy life and telling people
[38:27] yeah I'm Bitcoin actions speak louder
[38:29] than words that's a thing yeah and which
[38:33] is also why you
[38:34] should that coin has two sides you
[38:37] should also look at what people do
[38:39] rather than listen to what they
[38:41] say especially
[38:44] politicians so so yeah it's very telling
[38:48] like what people
[38:49] do it's it's I think uh so much more
[38:53] telling what people do versus I I don't
[38:57] know why why I thought about now about
[38:58] that but ill mask him now to my mind
[39:02] because he talked uh right now he's not
[39:05] talking about Bitcoin or Dogecoin
[39:07] anything like that uh really rarely but
[39:09] in the time like 2021 2022 when he did
[39:12] he talked a lot about Dogecoin and there
[39:14] were like um statistics how much tweets
[39:17] he sent about Bitcoin and how much
[39:19] tweets he sent about Dogecoin and it was
[39:20] like 10x that number but he also was on
[39:23] podcast where with KY woods and
[39:25] everybody and where he was oh how much
[39:28] Bitcoin how much Dogecoin do you have
[39:30] and he did not go into exact numbers but
[39:33] he basically said so much more Bitcoin
[39:35] then doin privately and all his company
[39:37] only bought Bitcoin never anything else
[39:41] and that's also like uh like see what
[39:45] they're doing like he he was not uh he
[39:48] talked only about Dogecoin but he never
[39:50] went ahead and bought it because he
[39:53] intrinsically most likely knows that
[39:55] it's a [ __ ] or he does not know I don't
[39:57] know what he thinks uh but yeah many
[40:02] yeah I guess that's just trolling they
[40:03] are better examples I think the to to
[40:05] this
[40:07] mus it's it's um when you look ahead in
[40:11] the like the next years and we talked
[40:12] about little bit about the price what
[40:14] what topics are you currently really uh
[40:16] interested in Bitcoin like what's your
[40:19] current Rabbit Hole you're learning now
[40:21] about Bitcoin or maybe also not about
[40:25] Bitcoin yeah that's interesting I
[40:30] I in not about Bitcoin I'm really deep
[40:33] into and we've done a couple of episodes
[40:35] about this about how to which extent the
[40:38] mind creates reality and how your focus
[40:41] and attention can can literally shape
[40:44] your your world and to which extent that
[40:47] is true and not true and and also like
[40:50] debates about Free Will and time and how
[40:53] that relates to the mind and what we can
[40:55] actually change and not uh so I I I
[40:59] don't really like stuff like that
[41:02] uh in in Bitcoin I I guess this um uh I
[41:07] I I think or I I shouldn't say ordinance
[41:11] I should say ocean mining is a is a very
[41:14] interesting company recently started
[41:16] company and the whole debate about what
[41:19] to do about the
[41:21] spam um that's a a good the people's
[41:26] views on filtering is a good filtering
[41:29] mechanism in itself to a certain extent
[41:32] because you can see who the Bad actors
[41:33] are by by by by just observing what side
[41:36] of that argument they're on uh in my
[41:40] opinion
[41:42] so yeah uh that's that's one rabbit hole
[41:46] it's it's kind of an unfortunate rabbit
[41:48] hole because I I wish that this wasn't
[41:51] happening and that we didn't have to
[41:54] deal with all this [ __ ] uh [ __ ]
[41:56] coining on bitcoin but I suspect there
[41:59] will be more of it in the future
[42:02] um yeah so so in Bitcoin this old
[42:05] mining stuff it's it's uh like a little
[42:10] nerdy best project to study that more
[42:13] and to understand it more I guess
[42:16] um what else um yeah they ju just in
[42:22] general these these other games like um
[42:25] in doing a podcast there there's a lot
[42:27] of other skills that come into that too
[42:30] and tactics and and strategy for the
[42:33] thing so
[42:34] like how how to play the the the podcast
[42:38] game how to get you know YouTube
[42:40] subscribers and whatnot and while still
[42:43] keeping your integrity so how how to
[42:46] select sponsors that you can really um
[42:50] that you can trust and that can trust
[42:52] you and how to how to navigate this
[42:55] whole game of this attention game like
[42:59] trying to get attention without trying
[43:01] to get attention I
[43:03] guess uh because like you want your
[43:06] ideas and your voice to be heard in the
[43:08] world so you so you have to play the if
[43:11] you're in if you're creating content of
[43:13] course you're not creating it in a
[43:14] vacuum you want people to hear it or see
[43:17] it but at the same time you want to keep
[43:19] a very very high integrity so you want
[43:23] you basically you want to be Stanley
[43:25] Kubrick who who um you
[43:27] know got a contract with Warner Brothers
[43:30] when he was around 20 years old you can
[43:32] do whatever you want with whatever
[43:34] budget you want for the rest of your
[43:36] life um and uh so so that's the sort of
[43:40] the situation you want to be in right
[43:42] but of course that's never your exact
[43:45] reality so you have to adapt to whatever
[43:47] reality you're in but yeah that's
[43:52] U um getting getting your voice heard
[43:56] but still keeping your integrity um that
[44:00] that's uh a good balance to find I think
[44:03] and also like a balance between ego and
[44:07] complete ego dropping like to what
[44:10] extent is an ego a a good tool and to
[44:13] what extent is ego completely
[44:16] unnecessary and to what extent is your
[44:19] ego preventing you from reaching levels
[44:22] you couldn't have reached if you were
[44:24] more egotistical um long and convoluted
[44:27] sentence but like I I like those subject
[44:29] as well and most of the times I think
[44:32] egos just stand in people's ways even
[44:35] even if your ego is the thing that's
[44:36] telling you to be to have too much
[44:39] self-criticism and be too shy that's
[44:41] also an ego thing in a way
[44:45] uh it has to do with
[44:48] vanity yeah there there are so many so
[44:51] many things that I'm interested in and
[44:53] you know I have a nerdy personality I go
[44:56] into like the yesterday and this morning
[45:00] I looked at um these videos of a
[45:02] mathematical idea that I found
[45:04] interesting that the sum of all numbers
[45:06] if they actually go to Infinity is
[45:09] minus1 /
[45:11] 12 which extremely weird uh but it's
[45:15] this extremely weird branch of
[45:17] mathematics so so I love these little
[45:20] philosophical uh mathematics YouTube
[45:23] channels that are out there so I N Out
[45:26] on that kind of stuff every now and then
[45:27] as well so yeah there's lots and lots of
[45:30] things yeah with uh with with podcasting
[45:33] I I always compareed to bitcoin itself
[45:36] actually uh because Bitcoin when you
[45:38] hear bitcoiners talk about Bitcoin it's
[45:40] like almost too good to be true like the
[45:42] packaging how they phrase it and
[45:44] everything is like wow that that's
[45:46] amazing and then when you actually do
[45:48] the research and you think hear more
[45:50] about Bitcoin you're like that's
[45:52] actually also really true and it's the
[45:54] value is is also true and is for me it's
[45:57] like when you have for example a YouTube
[46:00] video uh the thumbnail and title and
[46:02] everything the packaging and the
[46:04] marketing it has to be good because
[46:06] otherwise people don't click and if
[46:08] people don't click you don't even give
[46:09] them this chance to to see what you have
[46:12] potentialized value but the value also
[46:15] has to uh H keep the promise of
[46:18] everything else exactly and uh yeah more
[46:21] often than not in Bitcoin I find it like
[46:23] when you some something sounds too good
[46:26] to be true andit in most cases in the
[46:29] rest of the world that means it's not
[46:31] true but in Bitcoin it means it's either
[46:33] true or it's even better than you
[46:35] thought it was so when you start
[46:37] studying it deeper like it's even better
[46:41] than this preposterously optimistic idea
[46:44] that someone else
[46:45] conveyed yeah it's it's very true um we
[46:49] having an end routine in the podcast
[46:50] where the previous guest asked a
[46:52] question for the next
[46:54] guest for for people that are also
[46:57] really a big fan of the Diary of a CEO
[46:59] podcast I just stole
[47:02] that entro team from him and it's it's
[47:04] an amazing
[47:06] one the the question for you is uh
[47:08] imagine you have all the Bitcoin you
[47:10] need uh in your life what else would be
[47:14] important for
[47:15] you time like the the the Bitcoins
[47:20] themselves are there to unlock time
[47:23] that's that's their that's what they do
[47:25] all all tools technologies that Humanity
[47:28] ever invented have one and the same
[47:31] single purpose and that is to save
[47:33] someone time
[47:35] somewhere uh and Bitcoin to me is the
[47:37] ultimate tool for time saving um so the
[47:42] the thing I want more of is not Bitcoin
[47:45] the thing I want more of is time that I
[47:48] decide over myself like so that I I'm
[47:51] the decision
[47:52] maker uh so yeah time I would say time
[47:57] is money money is time
[48:00] so that's very very true yeah um if you
[48:04] had one message you want to give uh our
[48:06] viewers uh what would it be one message
[48:10] one message like one one thing you you
[48:13] want to uh keep in people's
[48:18] mind get your hands on some Bitcoins for
[48:21] [ __ ]
[48:23] sake that's the that's the I think I
[48:26] think that's the the main message of my
[48:28] podcast I hopefully do a good job in
[48:33] that increase your freedom footprint
[48:36] yeah brush your teeth
[48:39] yeah two times or three times a
[48:42] day

[48:48] perfect then uh thaning n for for being
[48:51] on for people that want to reach you I
[48:53] guess you're really findable everywhere
