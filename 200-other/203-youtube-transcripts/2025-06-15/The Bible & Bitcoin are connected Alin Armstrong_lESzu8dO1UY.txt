[00:00] now I can get married and be confident I
[00:02] can take care of my family because I
[00:04] saved in Bitcoin and when I understood
[00:05] it its purpose was to bring us back to a
[00:08] sound hard money standard then the whole
[00:09] Bible took on a new meaning and all
[00:11] these scriptures came to mind oh my gosh
[00:13] this is what God was talking about when
[00:14] he was talking about Fair weights and
[00:16] measures and and in that moment I
[00:18] realized there's a connection between
[00:20] sound money and righteousness in society
[00:23] a lot of people who grow up outside of
[00:25] Christianity they never had an
[00:27] experience with objective truth
[00:31] before we uh dive really deep into the
[00:33] connection between Christianity the
[00:36] Bible and Bitcoin I always like to try
[00:40] to start with the basics and the basics
[00:43] always starts with like why do we do
[00:45] stuff and we cover a lot on this podcast
[00:48] why Bitcoin like over 69 episodes like
[00:52] this is the 69th episode now so we
[00:54] covered it I think well but what we
[00:56] didn't cover well uh on this podcast is
[00:58] why Christianity why are you a Christian
[01:02] and then after that we can go into the
[01:04] connection between the Bible and Bitcoin
[01:06] so why are you a
[01:09] Christian so just go we're recording
[01:13] not okay oh good why am I Christian
[01:16] that's a very very good question um the
[01:19] the and and so there's a long version
[01:22] there's a short version there's a medium
[01:23] version I'll give you somewhere in
[01:25] between um essentially the main reason
[01:28] I'm a Christian is is because uh Jesus
[01:32] Christ rose from the dead and if you
[01:35] read in the Bible in 1 Corinthians
[01:36] chapter
[01:37] 15 The Apostle Paul tells us if Christ
[01:41] has not been risen from the dead I think
[01:43] it's chapter 15 don't quote me it's in
[01:45] there somewhere he says if Christ is not
[01:47] risen from the dead then we are a people
[01:49] most to be pied and our faith is in vain
[01:54] now that's a that's a strong statement
[01:56] that's a that's a very harsh thing even
[01:59] to say um you know and basically what
[02:03] he's saying is this look excuse
[02:05] me if Jesus Christ is still dead
[02:10] then the whole world should pity
[02:13] Christians like we are lit what he's
[02:16] saying is you are literally wasting your
[02:18] life if Jesus is dead if Jesus of
[02:21] Nazareth didn't rise from the dead being
[02:24] a Christian is is the most foolish
[02:27] stupid waste of of life
[02:30] you could uh commit yourself to why
[02:34] because he's dead imagine going around
[02:39] and preaching about this Man from
[02:41] Nazareth called Jesus who did Miracles
[02:44] and all this stuff and the main hinge of
[02:47] his message uh of validating his message
[02:51] is that he rose from the dead that's the
[02:54] whole thing his whole Ministry he went
[02:56] around preaching teaching healing and
[02:59] and all this kind kind of stuff and the
[03:01] main thing he said I'm going to die and
[03:04] then on the third day I'm going to rise
[03:06] from the dead if he doesn't do that if
[03:08] he only does half of it if he only dies
[03:11] then this whole thing is a complete
[03:13] waste of time but if he actually did
[03:16] rise from the dead then this is the most
[03:19] important thing in the world so Jesus
[03:23] leaves us uh with a choice here uh you
[03:27] can't basically Jesus set it up like
[03:28] this you can't be in the middle either
[03:31] this is the most important thing ever or
[03:35] it's the biggest waste of life ever
[03:38] there's no in between uh it's not set up
[03:42] that way so the reason I'm a Christian
[03:44] is because I believe in my heart Jesus
[03:47] rose from the dead and you know there's
[03:49] lots of evidence that suggest this I've
[03:51] went through the the the Apologetics and
[03:55] truthfully for me there is no other
[03:59] explanation
[04:01] that makes sense of the evidence we have
[04:04] other than the fact that man he's alive
[04:07] he's actually alive he really did it um
[04:09] no other ex and I've thought on this for
[04:12] hours and hours and hours laying my head
[04:15] I couldn't tell you how many hours going
[04:18] to
[04:19] bed I'm thinking I'm trying to poke
[04:21] holes in it okay well maybe this happen
[04:24] maybe this happened or or or and I can't
[04:27] I cannot find an explanation that makes
[04:29] sense to me other than he's he's alive
[04:32] and so for that reason uh I'm a
[04:35] Christian I serve the Lord Jesus Christ
[04:37] because there's no other choice now it's
[04:41] you know like in Bitcoin when you see it
[04:44] you see it you can't unse it there's no
[04:47] going back and in Christianity once you
[04:50] understand he's alive there's no going
[04:52] back there's no going back so that's why
[04:54] I'm a Christian that's an amazing reason
[04:57] and and do you also see a connection
[05:00] between the uh I mean there's obviously
[05:02] a big difference and um the Bible and
[05:05] and Bitcoin are different things in
[05:07] general but do you see a connection
[05:09] between the original story of Bitcoin
[05:10] with satosi Nakamoto we don't know who
[05:13] he is there's a really nice Legend to it
[05:16] there like books and books about it who
[05:18] he might be but nobody knows for sure uh
[05:22] and with Jesus Christ is there like do
[05:24] you see there some some uh similarities
[05:28] or do you see some things that are
[05:31] important for Bitcoin that have Al are
[05:34] also mentioned in the
[05:35] bible well this a toosi question is
[05:38] interesting because there's like
[05:40] different extremes people have there's
[05:43] some one extreme sometimes I get on
[05:45] Twitter comments about Satoshi is the
[05:48] second coming of Christ I'm like well no
[05:51] he's not um and then the other extreme
[05:55] is like who cares about Satoshi right um
[05:58] of course there's similarity in the
[06:00] narrative now the the interesting thing
[06:02] is like Satoshi nobody knows who he is I
[06:05] think there's a reason for that he
[06:06] disappeared I think there's a reason for
[06:08] that uh I don't really
[06:11] think I'm not I'm not one to think it's
[06:14] a sort of a supernatural thing I think
[06:18] there's a good natural explanation about
[06:21] Satoshi I mean like you said there's
[06:23] this Legend around him and it's it's
[06:26] probably it's probably better that way
[06:28] because it adds the mystique and this
[06:30] mystery and you know it's it's more fun
[06:33] that way let's put it that way uh but
[06:35] the way I I see Satoshi in in general is
[06:38] I really think there's a natural thing
[06:40] here I think Satoshi was a guy who
[06:45] probably worked for the government at
[06:47] some point broke away created this thing
[06:50] and then disappeared because he knew
[06:52] it's interesting that he disappeared
[06:54] right around the time with the Wikileaks
[06:56] and that kind of stuff and he's like
[06:57] guys pump the brakes we don't want the
[06:59] government
[07:00] it's too small right now like let's just
[07:02] and then he disappears like I don't
[07:03] think that's a coincidence I think he's
[07:05] like okay they're on to us I better
[07:07] disappear my work here is done that's my
[07:10] personal view of it I think he's just a
[07:13] guy who's like okay I'm done with this I
[07:15] have to be done with this let's see what
[07:18] happens now you know I could see him
[07:20] sitting back somewhere going whoa it
[07:23] actually freaking worked like this is
[07:25] crazy uh because I I don't think Satoshi
[07:28] was was was crazy Bitcoin and was like
[07:30] Yep this is going to succeed I just know
[07:32] it it's it's I really think he just did
[07:34] it and he's watching it going wow I
[07:36] can't believe this thing's working this
[07:38] is this is wild it's take taken on of a
[07:39] life a life of it a life of its own it's
[07:42] almost like you like a child you know
[07:44] you make this child and then next thing
[07:46] you know he's out on his own and you go
[07:48] wow he's actually making it you know
[07:49] this this kind of cool so that's the way
[07:51] I see it yeah it's a it's an amazing
[07:53] thing when you think about uh s Nakamoto
[07:57] left so early on you usually if you
[08:00] build something if you do anything in
[08:02] life you have to really care for it even
[08:04] with with a child you cannot grate a
[08:07] child and then after one year you're
[08:08] like go on on the street go go out in
[08:11] the
[08:11] world you will find your way I mean
[08:15] maybe it works because maybe someone
[08:17] sees the child and picks it up and but
[08:19] yeah uh I mean kind of this is what
[08:22] happened with bitcon right he left the
[08:24] child out it was not ready maybe for for
[08:26] it being out and someone else picked it
[08:28] up and was carrying it uh away and this
[08:32] was maybe the reason why it still lives
[08:34] on because it has no master it has no
[08:36] voice it has no uh no one that oversees
[08:40] it uh no one that has like the control
[08:43] of it Bitcoin would be so different if
[08:45] we wouldn't know satosi Nakamoto and if
[08:48] satosi Nakamoto is on podcast and stuff
[08:50] it would be so different uh and that's
[08:54] that's an amazing thing that we don't
[08:56] have this uh right now here and it's
[09:00] also ties back a little bit to to Jesus
[09:03] Christ because he's also not on podcast
[09:06] we know like we we obviously there are
[09:10] things written down uh but he's not now
[09:13] alive and he's not now in like the the
[09:16] the world present like on podcast like
[09:19] you and
[09:20] me you know what I mean yeah so there
[09:23] are uh things uh in common and I also
[09:27] see some connection in between there and
[09:30] before we got get into the connection
[09:32] between the Bible and Bitcoin uh did you
[09:35] were always a religious person did you
[09:37] always in Christianity is this something
[09:40] that came from you from your when you
[09:42] were small and just you grew up with it
[09:44] or was there like something in your life
[09:46] like then you found uh found
[09:49] it yeah I grew up in a nominally
[09:52] Orthodox home uh my family's from
[09:55] Romania we left Romania in 19 when it
[09:59] was 80 right right before a couple maybe
[10:02] six or seven months before communism
[10:05] fell we left so we missed all the fun
[10:09] but uh we left came to Canada and grew
[10:12] up in a very nominal Orthodox Eastern
[10:15] Orthodox home never went to church you
[10:19] know for maybe for a wedding or a
[10:21] baptism or something uh but that that
[10:23] was it there was no Bible in my house
[10:25] there was no uh you know my parents
[10:29] never shared Bible stories we had icons
[10:32] on the wall you know Mary and stuff that
[10:34] was it though um so you know when I
[10:36] became a teenager I became I said I was
[10:39] an atheist but you know deep down I
[10:41] still thought ah there's got to be
[10:42] something but I lived like an atheist
[10:45] and it wasn't until I was uh in my early
[10:49] early 20s that I really wanted to dis
[10:53] dig in and get to the bottom of of this
[10:56] and I knew there was something special
[10:58] about Jesus like you know I studied
[11:00] Islam I studied Buddhism I studied
[11:03] different religions and the one thing
[11:05] that kept popping up is is Jesus in
[11:07] every one of them and he was like a very
[11:10] special character in each religion even
[11:12] in Islam Jesus is very unique character
[11:16] even in Islam he's born he's the only
[11:18] Prophet even in Islam born of a virgin
[11:21] why what's so special about him that
[11:24] even Islam you know honors I mean the
[11:27] only woman named in the Quran is Mary
[11:30] his mother why what's so special about
[11:32] him so I had to discover okay I had to
[11:33] get to the bottom who is Jesus I have to
[11:36] figure this guy out and when I did I was
[11:39] like wow he's Lord I have to serve him
[11:42] and in a sort of lesser way with Bitcoin
[11:45] it was the same sort of thing I I I I
[11:47] went on a journey where I said okay what
[11:49] is
[11:50] bitcoin because every four years it it
[11:53] keeps popping up these crazy price
[11:56] rallies and uh I have to I got to to a
[11:59] point in 2020 where I had this I had a
[12:01] similar experience where I said I have
[12:03] to get to the bottom of Bitcoin I have
[12:05] to figure it out I have to know what it
[12:07] is and if if it's not for me it's not
[12:09] for me at least I
[12:11] know so I went down that rabbit hole and
[12:15] well here I am you
[12:16] know um I figured it out and I was like
[12:19] Wow Bitcoin is something special and um
[12:22] it's an opport I was talking with a
[12:24] friend yesterday and he were saying look
[12:28] Bitcoin is I think Greg Foss says
[12:31] something along the lines of you only
[12:33] get one asymmetric trade in your
[12:38] lifetime but Bitcoin seems like it's a
[12:41] Once In A
[12:43] like
[12:44] Century
[12:46] opportunity this is this is this is a a
[12:49] wealth transfer this is an opportunity
[12:53] that I don't know human beings will see
[12:55] another one like this for a couple
[12:57] hundred
[12:58] years um and you know I thank God that I
[13:01] was able to I thank God that I he gave
[13:04] me an obsessive personality to where
[13:07] once I cling to something I have to
[13:09] figure it out because if that wasn't my
[13:12] personality I would have just been like
[13:13] ah who cares you know
[13:16] so to answer your I don't know how we
[13:18] ended up here with Bitcoin But to answer
[13:19] your question no I did not grow up
[13:21] religious I found Christ in my early 20s
[13:25] and um through through through the
[13:27] research and the uh investigation
[13:30] yeah everything ties back to bitcoin
[13:31] somehow it's like I don't know if you
[13:34] have this experience when I'm talking in
[13:36] in not about Bitcoin it also like oh I
[13:39] want to get Bitcoin in that conversation
[13:41] but I usually try to not do it too
[13:44] much because people are resisting that a
[13:47] little bit uh now let's get uh into the
[13:51] the and I asked that question if you
[13:53] were religious before because uh in
[13:56] Bitcoin I knew that you were not born a
[13:58] bitco Co because Bitcoin was not there
[14:00] when you were born even though I don't
[14:02] know how old you are but probably you
[14:04] older than than Bitcoin uh so you
[14:07] discovered Bitcoin at some point but you
[14:08] also discovered uh Christianity at some
[14:11] point and that is really interesting uh
[14:13] where do you see now and you wrote a
[14:15] book about it the Bible and and Bitcoin
[14:18] um where do you can see now the the
[14:20] connection between the Bible
[14:22] Christianity religion in general uh and
[14:26] Bitcoin I think Bitcoin is
[14:29] is this is the sort of I don't know if
[14:32] this is a paradox maybe I'm using that
[14:34] word incorrectly but maybe I'm not
[14:36] Bitcoin is sort of a paradox because
[14:38] it's a new
[14:41] technology but somehow this new
[14:43] technology is bringing us back to the
[14:45] ancient ways if if if you get what I'm
[14:48] saying because in the ancient days in
[14:51] the biblical days all they had was sound
[14:54] money uh all they had was silver and
[14:57] gold and you know if you go even further
[15:00] back cattle and different grains and
[15:02] stuff but but by the time you get to the
[15:04] time of Jesus it was a silver and gold
[15:07] coins that was the money they had a
[15:09] sound hard money standard that's all
[15:11] they knew they didn't really have a Fiat
[15:13] standard um in the times of Jesus so
[15:16] Bitcoin being the most sound money there
[15:18] is ever it's taking us back to the
[15:22] ancient ways of sound money now I know
[15:26] that sounds maybe that sounds silly to
[15:29] some people but you know we've lived in
[15:32] this very small sliver of time with Fiat
[15:37] money um it's not been really that long
[15:42] when you take the whole history of
[15:43] humankind into consideration we're in a
[15:46] very small sliver of this paper Fiat
[15:50] money experiment if you will and it
[15:52] hasn't taken very long for it to expose
[15:56] itself as um you know not viable for the
[16:00] long term so Bitcoin through this new
[16:03] revolutionary technology is bringing us
[16:06] back to the ancient days and so when I
[16:09] when I was listening to the Bitcoin
[16:11] standard by safed and he mentioned uh uh
[16:14] I forget where it was in the book but
[16:16] maybe somewhere at the beginning or the
[16:17] middle he said he mentioned about the
[16:19] emperor Nero and how Nero uh he um did a
[16:25] thing called coin clipping where you
[16:26] know they would clip the coins and melt
[16:30] down the clippings and inflate the money
[16:31] supply and the coins would become
[16:33] smaller and smaller and that was a a
[16:36] form of like ancient inflation or
[16:38] whatever and he said that um that was
[16:42] the beginning of the fall of
[16:44] Rome and it clicked in my mind I was
[16:46] like like I had this experience where in
[16:49] a moment I
[16:52] understood tyrants inflate money and
[16:56] Destroy civilizations
[16:59] and Nero was the mo one of the most
[17:01] brutal persecutors of Christians one of
[17:03] the most evil Emperors uh who who would
[17:06] kill uh Christians and light them on
[17:08] fire and throw them to the Lions and so
[17:11] and so then I had these thoughts of like
[17:14] Justin Trudeau and Canada I'm like oh my
[17:16] gosh all the tyrants all they do is
[17:18] inflate money and Destro and hate Christ
[17:21] so I said there's and in that moment I
[17:23] realized there's a connection between
[17:25] sound money and righteousness in society
[17:31] and that was really the light bulb
[17:33] moment where I said okay I wanted to
[17:36] understand Bitcoin my journey was I have
[17:38] to understand Bitcoin because I'm
[17:40] obsessive and I have to figure it out or
[17:41] else I can't
[17:43] sleep but what what I what I was really
[17:46] looking for was not to understand
[17:48] Bitcoin it was to understand
[17:51] money
[17:52] why I thought I wanted an answer to the
[17:56] question what is bitcoin but but what I
[17:59] really needed was an answer to the
[18:02] question why is
[18:05] Bitcoin what what problem is it solving
[18:08] why was it created what's its purpose
[18:11] and when I understood it its purpose was
[18:13] to bring us back to a sound hard money
[18:15] standard then the whole Bible took on a
[18:17] new meaning and all these scriptures
[18:19] came to mind I go oh my gosh this is
[18:20] what God was talking about when he was
[18:22] talking about Fair weights and measures
[18:24] and and that old commandment you shall
[18:28] not steal I didn't grow up in a in a
[18:30] very Christian home but I at least knew
[18:34] you shall not steal that was I knew
[18:36] about that one but that commandment you
[18:38] shall not steal took on whole new
[18:40] meaning because to me it was like okay
[18:43] don't steal from your neighbor don't
[18:44] take his you know wallet or whatever but
[18:48] that it ended there and what what this
[18:51] journey in Bitcoin helped me do was
[18:52] expand that definition
[18:54] to theft is a lot more cunning than just
[18:59] swiping your neighbor's wallet or
[19:01] something theft happens at institutional
[19:04] levels when Nero was clipping coins that
[19:07] was theft when the governments print
[19:09] money this is inflation this is theft
[19:12] taxation this is theft and then it was
[19:15] like boom the floodgates were open and I
[19:17] knew at that point I saw it I could not
[19:20] unsee it for me as a Christian Bitcoin
[19:25] now had become a moral
[19:27] imperative
[19:29] and it when when it became a moral
[19:34] issue then then what choice do I have as
[19:37] a Christian ABS I have to speak the
[19:40] truth about it and it's funny how uh
[19:44] Bitcoin brings back or shines a light on
[19:48] those Traditional Values I see so many
[19:51] bitcoiners having those Traditional
[19:54] Values and I talked with I think 10
[19:57] podcasts ago with with uh the guy from
[20:00] SATs saver who has eight
[20:04] kids and he he talks about how Bitcoin
[20:07] influences that thinking about kids and
[20:10] uh making yourself in into the world and
[20:13] how Bitcoin influences your thinking uh
[20:16] of Traditional Values and and
[20:18] conservativism and all those stuff and
[20:21] it's interesting how uh we are not going
[20:24] forward in in in time we're more like
[20:28] going back backwards on a sound money
[20:29] standard but with a new technology
[20:32] because gold was a good sound money but
[20:35] gold was not ready for our digital um
[20:38] economy so we had this hybrid solution
[20:42] with Fiat which was then completely
[20:44] deleted by gold and now we're bringing
[20:47] the sound money system that is tested
[20:49] over time back with Bitcoin and this is
[20:53] something beautiful once you understand
[20:55] that that Bitcoin is not oh a new
[20:57] experiment we is starting now no it's a
[21:00] tested system um on technology railroads
[21:05] that are now
[21:07] functioning and this is completely
[21:09] changing the few and um this is also
[21:13] explaining why not all the 15y old uh
[21:17] people are in Bitcoin but also the 50 60
[21:21] even 65 year old people are into Bitcoin
[21:24] because they get what Bitcoin is once
[21:26] they get the technology side some don't
[21:29] get the economic side some don't get the
[21:32] technology side and people who get both
[21:35] sides they get Bitcoin I always see it
[21:38] like there are some uh software
[21:40] developers they like really they
[21:42] understand the grasp why Bitcoin
[21:44] functions technically but then they're
[21:46] like ah it's it's deflationary we need
[21:49] inflationary money and stuff like that
[21:51] because they don't get the economics out
[21:52] of it um and I'm curious now uh because
[21:56] you uh had Christianity before and you
[21:59] were in uh and then you discovered
[22:01] Bitcoin how did Bitcoin additionally to
[22:04] Christianity change your view of the
[22:06] world did there was there anything that
[22:09] was completely changing the way you
[22:11] think about stuff with
[22:13] Bitcoin Bitcoin helped
[22:16] me um H H how can I say this uh so I I
[22:22] had I always had hope in the about the
[22:24] future uh even even as you see
[22:26] everything around you go to go to crap
[22:30] you know I always had hope okay I'm
[22:33] clinging to Christ he's risen he's alive
[22:36] he's going to win he has the victory
[22:38] he's the king so I had this hope I still
[22:40] have this
[22:41] hope
[22:43] but um I didn't
[22:46] know I I always had this uh maybe not
[22:50] confusion but a conflict uh Within Me of
[22:54] I knew even before Bitcoin I knew that
[22:56] the money was broken
[22:59] um I used to say things like the dollar
[23:02] is backed by
[23:03] bullets uh that it's fake it's not real
[23:07] money but when people would ask me like
[23:09] we had a Bible study early in 2020 and
[23:12] this is kind of was part of the journey
[23:15] where we went through this and I said
[23:16] all right guys like it's it's clear it's
[23:18] obvious that the money's broken it's an
[23:21] evil system run uh with with uh you know
[23:26] demonic principles
[23:29] um what do we do as a Christian Living
[23:32] in this system how can you just not use
[23:36] money do we live live off the grid do we
[23:40] become Amish you know what do we do how
[23:43] do you live as a faithful Christian in a
[23:45] system that's so glaringly evil and we
[23:48] went back and forth and nobody really
[23:50] had a good answer and I didn't have a
[23:51] good answer either until Bitcoin came
[23:54] and I'm like oh my gosh because I prayed
[23:56] Lord give me an answer like this is a
[23:59] conundrum we're in here and next thing
[24:02] you know I'm exposed to bitcoin I hear
[24:04] the Bitcoin standard I listen to the
[24:05] book the Bitcoin standard I go down I'm
[24:07] like wow this I think this is the answer
[24:10] to my prayer I think this is a system
[24:13] where it honors God his principles it's
[24:16] not evil it's
[24:18] apolitical I think this is it and I
[24:20] brought this to the church I said guys
[24:22] check this
[24:23] out half of them said you're crazy some
[24:26] of them even left the church
[24:29] this this was crazy to me I remember
[24:31] talking to a guy and I said
[24:33] hey and I was trying to be gentle right
[24:37] I said I think like Fiat money dollars
[24:39] are
[24:41] evil and he goes how could you say that
[24:44] are you saying we're all participating
[24:46] in evil I said well I I don't know if I
[24:48] would say you're participating in it so
[24:50] much
[24:52] so well I wouldn't say you're
[24:54] participating in it you're a victim of
[24:56] it this has been imposed on you nothing
[24:59] you could do about it um and I'm not
[25:02] going to call a victim a uh a
[25:06] perpetrator but let's face the facts
[25:08] it's evil it's built on debt the whole
[25:11] thing is a system of
[25:13] debt he left the church because he got
[25:15] offended I'm like what are you serving
[25:16] Fiat like what the heck's going on so um
[25:20] anyways long story short
[25:23] um I lost my train of thought what was
[25:25] it
[25:26] again original question was how did
[25:30] Bitcoin change your view of the world oh
[25:32] yes um so what it did was it gave me a
[25:35] righteous
[25:37] alternative that I could opt into and
[25:41] what and what I've seen happen with even
[25:43] those in my church who have adopted
[25:46] Bitcoin in their own life with their own
[25:47] finances so our church we have Bitcoin
[25:50] on our balance sheet a lot of people in
[25:53] the church have followed suit and I
[25:55] never told anyone to buy Bitcoin never
[25:58] they did their own research and they
[26:00] come to their own conviction and they
[26:01] bought it just so everyone knows cuz
[26:02] some people are accusing me you're going
[26:04] to impoverish your church no I never
[26:06] told a single solitary Soul go buy
[26:09] Bitcoin I just said here's what it is
[26:12] make your choice
[26:14] um so what what I'm seeing in others is
[26:20] a different optimism that wasn't there
[26:24] before young people who are saying wow
[26:27] now I can buy a
[26:29] house because I saved in Bitcoin or now
[26:32] I can afford this car because I saved in
[26:35] Bitcoin or now I I I'm I can get married
[26:39] and be confident I could take care of my
[26:41] family because I saved in Bitcoin so
[26:44] there's and it's happened in my life too
[26:46] where you see everything getting more
[26:48] expensive and you I sometimes I go down
[26:50] my Facebook feed and it's so
[26:52] depressing because people are saying I
[26:54] can't afford I can't afford a house I
[26:57] can't afford this I can't afford that
[26:59] but when I'm looking at my savings
[27:01] everything's getting
[27:03] cheaper
[27:05] and it gives you this optimism for the
[27:07] future like Hey we're we're winning you
[27:10] know like there's a better solution and
[27:12] it's Godly it's a righteous solution
[27:14] it's a good system I it's based on
[27:17] mathematics and honesty and integrity
[27:20] you don't have to trust there's no
[27:22] government
[27:23] involved so there's this optimism that
[27:26] that comes with Bitcoin where even in
[27:29] the highs and even in the lows you're so
[27:31] optimistic all the time because in the
[27:33] lows you buy more in the highs it's
[27:36] high so that's that's I think I don't
[27:39] know if that anwers your question um but
[27:41] there's this optim there's this tangible
[27:43] optimism now where it's it's not so much
[27:46] where I'm saying okay Jesus is going to
[27:48] come back and fix everything it's Jesus
[27:51] Is With Us now and he's giving us this
[27:54] tool so that we can prosper have
[27:58] families and and and spread his name
[28:01] throughout the Earth there's no more
[28:03] there's there's no Doom and Gloom
[28:05] anymore there's a bright future be happy
[28:09] Rejoice you know like there's just more
[28:12] optimism it's amazing and you said
[28:15] something with participating in fear is
[28:17] evil and I totally understand and
[28:20] totally agree Al with that um is do you
[28:23] also see and is a random question but do
[28:27] you see when you take out a loan in fear
[28:31] uh and buy Bitcoin with
[28:33] that is that also evil like M doing it I
[28:37] think C MO is also talking about that
[28:40] even in the fat standard I think would
[28:43] would that be considered evil that's a
[28:46] great question
[28:48] and there's certain trusted people where
[28:52] we can discuss this and in my life and
[28:55] there's certain others who just don't
[28:57] get it
[28:59] there's a several people I know in my
[29:00] own personal life who even go to my
[29:02] church who took out huge
[29:04] loans at the bottom and bought tons of
[29:06] Bitcoin and they are doing great now now
[29:10] when they when they said hey Pastor I
[29:12] took out x amount of money uh and I
[29:15] bought a ton of Bitcoin when it was at
[29:17] like 20K I was like okay you know the
[29:21] risk um do whatever is it immoral here's
[29:25] the
[29:26] thing the whole system is immoral okay
[29:31] taking out debt to buy Bitcoin what's
[29:33] the difference between taking out debt
[29:34] to buy Bitcoin or taking out debt to buy
[29:36] a house what's the
[29:38] difference they're they're both I mean a
[29:41] house is considered an asset maybe it
[29:42] shouldn't be but it is so you take out a
[29:45] loan you buy a house you take out a loan
[29:46] you buy Bitcoin what's the difference I
[29:48] don't see a difference some people who
[29:52] don't understand Bitcoin will say well
[29:53] that's risky well that's a risk you're
[29:55] taking on and if if if that's a risk
[29:57] that you're willing willing to take on
[29:59] okay you know you could buy a house and
[30:01] lose your job then what it's a r
[30:04] everything is risk every time you take
[30:06] out debt it's a risk so I don't see it
[30:09] as an immoral thing to do um you're
[30:12] shorting the dollar and those who have
[30:15] done that are doing well thus far um but
[30:19] again it is a risk and uh if that's part
[30:22] of your risk profile go for it if I was
[30:24] a single guy with no wife no kids I
[30:28] would have done that 100% 21 Bitcoin is
[30:31] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[30:34] and preach self custody this is my goto
[30:37] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[30:40] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[30:42] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[30:46] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[30:48] support this podcast use code Robin and
[30:51] click the link in the description I also
[30:54] tried it just for fun I did it with a
[30:55] really small amount uh just to try and
[30:58] was interesting because it's not as easy
[31:00] as it seems to get a loan if your bank
[31:03] account is full of Bitcoin
[31:06] transactions because you have to give
[31:07] them bit your bank account and mine was
[31:10] just like money coming in going out on
[31:13] do Bitcoin exchange like
[31:16] this my my friend who did this he I
[31:19] don't know maybe it's different where
[31:20] you live but in Canada he said it was
[31:23] easy he went to the he has good credit
[31:25] they offered him like hey we'll give you
[31:27] x amount you thought okay they didn't
[31:30] even ask him what he was using it
[31:32] for the lady asked him uh just in just
[31:35] in passing hey what are you gonna do
[31:37] with all this money he said ah go on
[31:39] vacation you know
[31:41] what said whatever he wasn't going to
[31:43] tell them by Bitcoin because I could
[31:44] have raised Flags right but I'll
[31:46] probably go on vacation do something
[31:47] nice for myself you know but but that's
[31:50] funny uh when you say oh I took a bunch
[31:53] of money and to go on a holiday is
[31:56] better to uh taking out a bunch of money
[31:59] to buy an
[32:01] asset that in itself is like the holiday
[32:04] should raise red flags and not buying an
[32:07] asset this should
[32:09] have red flags this
[32:11] is that's funny yeah um coming back to
[32:16] Christianity and and Bitcoin uh when you
[32:19] meet and I think I'm really deeply
[32:22] convinced
[32:23] that different people need a different
[32:26] explanation of Bitcoin
[32:28] that's why I have this mission to bring
[32:30] 300 bitcoiners onto the podcast this
[32:33] year which is a crazy goal because this
[32:36] means I have to do at least six podcast
[32:39] recordings a a week uh but it's
[32:42] important so we get all the different FS
[32:45] uh in one channel and I just want to do
[32:47] that so I think I'm on the mission this
[32:48] year for do for doing this and um when
[32:52] we now come to Christianity and I think
[32:54] you're the one of the best person to do
[32:57] that how can we a deeply um deeply
[33:01] convinced person in Christianity that
[33:04] says Bitcoin is just a scam convinced of
[33:07] of of Bitcoin like how can we explain
[33:09] Bitcoin to someone who gets Christianity
[33:12] but not
[33:14] Bitcoin yeah that's the question I'm
[33:16] trying to answer all the
[33:19] time excuse me
[33:22] um well I wrote the book for that reason
[33:25] the Bible in Bitcoin it's very short
[33:27] purpose because I didn't want to
[33:29] overwhelm people and it was written
[33:31] specifically for
[33:33] Christians
[33:35] um I found success with with Christians
[33:38] by showing them the moral side of it
[33:42] like you know some Christians will come
[33:44] and say oh it's a Ponzi scheme or it's
[33:47] it's a scam or whatever and it's really
[33:49] easy whenever someone tells you Bitcoin
[33:51] is a is a Ponzi scheme you just ask them
[33:53] do you hold dollars yes well let's let's
[33:57] go through let's go through the system
[33:59] that gives us dollars very easy to
[34:01] demonstrate that's actually a Ponzi
[34:03] scheme and most of the most Christians I
[34:06] talked to um uh are not too fond of the
[34:10] government at least anymore because of
[34:13] covid and this and the different things
[34:14] that happen here in
[34:16] Canada and so it's very easy to to to
[34:19] well okay so who do you trust who do you
[34:20] trust more in the government or math a
[34:23] math protocol well it's a no-brainer
[34:26] right um so so for for believers I just
[34:29] I just like to show them look it's it's
[34:32] a it's a honest sound system built on
[34:36] biblical principles of of you shall not
[34:40] steal um equal weights and measures
[34:43] honesty Integrity uh no trust needed um
[34:48] at that point the ball's in their Court
[34:51] you have a choice now you know Fiat
[34:53] money is
[34:55] immoral and you know Bitcoin is a PO
[34:58] IAL so what are you going to
[35:01] choose yeah was this the reason also you
[35:05] wrote the book to orange pill um
[35:09] Christian Christians or did something
[35:12] else also Inspire or motivate
[35:15] you no it was basically just to orange
[35:17] pill Christians because I had a good
[35:19] amount of Christians asking me about it
[35:22] and it was just like oh my gosh I can't
[35:24] spend all
[35:26] day doing this
[35:28] so I wrote the book as a way to just say
[35:30] hey read this and then we could talk
[35:32] after uh you know just as a way to
[35:34] multiply almost as a way to multiply
[35:37] myself um so that because I can't be
[35:39] everywhere at once and so I wrote the
[35:41] book just as a way to be able to and for
[35:43] Christians too to be able to just hand
[35:45] it to their pastors or priests or
[35:46] whatever and say Hey you know because a
[35:48] lot of Christians were are messaging me
[35:50] saying how do I talk to my pastor how do
[35:52] I talk to my priest how do I talk to you
[35:55] know the board at church about Bitcoin I
[35:57] don't know how to do it and I wrote the
[35:59] book for that too like well you know get
[36:01] a book and just hand it to them say Hey
[36:02] you know it's a short book um will you
[36:05] read this and then we could talk about
[36:07] it and most people uh um who've messaged
[36:10] me have had success uh with that
[36:13] strategy it's it's easier than trying to
[36:14] bring it up you know uh hey you know go
[36:17] to your pastor hey man I want to have a
[36:19] meeting with you let's spend an hour
[36:20] talking about Bitcoin sometimes these
[36:22] guys they they don't want to hear it you
[36:23] know ah whatever you give them a little
[36:25] book you know it's it's a lot easier do
[36:27] that then they try to to push it you
[36:30] know yeah it's so much easier now I
[36:32] think Orange Building in general uh you
[36:34] have like if if there's no interest from
[36:37] the person coming that he does not want
[36:39] to get Bitcoin I think it's really hard
[36:43] to uh get the interest going in him uh
[36:47] depends on what relationship you have
[36:49] with him but most of the time it's
[36:51] really hard uh to get that interest
[36:53] going so it should be like some
[36:55] intrinsic uh motiv some intrinsic
[36:58] interest and some most of the time it
[37:00] comes from just number go up technology
[37:03] uh you see it as you said yourself every
[37:05] four years this crazy Cycles are coming
[37:07] up and you're like oh wow it shoots up
[37:09] to 20,000 you're like oh I'm dumb I
[37:11] did not get in then you it shoots down
[37:13] to to 3,000 you're like oh I'm so clever
[37:16] I did not get in and then it shoots up
[37:19] back to 69,000 oh I'm so stupid and
[37:22] uh if you live through one two three
[37:24] Cycles all of the sudden you're like so
[37:26] let's what what what is this thing
[37:28] actually so you start questioning uh
[37:31] those things and and I think this this
[37:34] interest is is uh starting more and more
[37:36] as in the mainstream because with every
[37:38] cycle there are some Bitcoin bitcoiners
[37:42] sticking to it like some uh that are
[37:45] just coming in and getting out they are
[37:47] just leaving again and maybe they're
[37:49] coming back in the next cycle but some
[37:52] are actually sticking with it and
[37:53] they're like oh this is the thing this
[37:56] is what I should should put more
[37:58] financial energy in and um another
[38:01] question like the different way now uh
[38:04] when you think of bitcoiner and I think
[38:06] a lot of Bitcoin are actually Christians
[38:09] but there are also a lot of other
[38:10] religions and there are probably also a
[38:12] lot of uh bitcoiners that are don't
[38:15] believe uh in in any any anything so and
[38:19] except maybe s
[38:21] Nakamoto or the white paper um do you
[38:24] think bitcoiners in general have the
[38:28] values of Christianity do they have the
[38:30] potential to be
[38:33] Christian yeah I see this a lot where I
[38:36] even I got a message today from somebody
[38:38] actually who was saying oh you know I
[38:40] was got into Bitcoin and next thing I
[38:42] know uh I'm in church and I'm being
[38:45] baptized and I'm a
[38:47] Christian and when I first became a
[38:50] bitcoiner I found that strange I'm like
[38:53] what's going on here
[38:55] because excuse me I came from
[38:58] Christianity to bitcoin so for me it
[39:01] wasn't you know there was no spiritual
[39:04] experience it was just like okay Bitcoin
[39:06] I understand it oh wow makes sense it
[39:08] fits with my worldview okay let's go but
[39:12] some people they get into Bitcoin then
[39:13] they have this spiritual experience they
[39:15] become Christians and I thought that's
[39:18] so strange what is going on here why is
[39:20] this happening it's not just one or two
[39:22] people it's like tons of people are
[39:24] telling me some people they move the
[39:27] outside Vador then they become
[39:28] Christians I'm like what's going on and
[39:30] I I think the reason for this is because
[39:33] a lot of people who grow who grow up
[39:35] outside of
[39:38] Christianity they never had an
[39:41] experience with objective
[39:43] truth um and Bitcoin for a lot of them
[39:47] is that first experience where they
[39:49] encounter this thing that is just
[39:52] objectively true does not care about
[39:54] anything else it just does what it does
[39:58] truthfully every time period it's an
[40:02] objective truth protocol and when people
[40:05] encounter that it changes them because
[40:08] if you've never had an encounter with an
[40:10] objective truth it's a it's a it can
[40:13] become like a spiritual experience and
[40:15] so when they realize oh oh oh goodness
[40:17] there is there is excuse me I'm just
[40:19] getting over a cold so forgive my cough
[40:21] um there is objective truth here well
[40:25] where else is there objective truth and
[40:27] and then you go down the rabbit hole and
[40:29] you end with God and you and you go wow
[40:32] okay it all makes sense now the way I
[40:34] understand Bitcoin is Bitcoin is a layer
[40:36] 2 technology on God's layer one
[40:39] technology God being the infinite
[40:42] Creator who's outside of time outside of
[40:44] space he's not bound by it created time
[40:49] and space therefore he created math God
[40:53] coded the universe in the language he
[40:56] uses is
[40:58] math and on top of that layer one
[41:02] bitcoin's built Layer Two math
[41:04] protocol so that's how I understand the
[41:07] the universe God creates it he codes it
[41:09] you know it says he said he said he
[41:11] speaks God's language is math he creates
[41:14] it he codes it he runs the program it's
[41:16] the universe we come along as his image
[41:19] and what do we do we take God's layer
[41:22] one technology and we build a layer two
[41:25] on top of it this is bit coin
[41:29] so that's the experience that's what I
[41:31] think happens with people when they get
[41:33] into Bitcoin now of course there's
[41:35] atheists who are Bitcoin and and other
[41:37] worldviews who who are into Bitcoin as
[41:40] well uh but I would argue that they are
[41:45] still standing on God's layer one
[41:48] whether or not they believe it or not
[41:50] they're standing on God's layer one and
[41:52] using this layer 2 technology that's
[41:54] built on top of it yeah it's like when
[41:57] people uh and I often see this like
[42:00] Bitcoin will eat itself into the whole
[42:03] economy so uh even though people might
[42:07] not uh want it or even though people
[42:10] might not see it they will use Bitcoin
[42:13] on the back end there will be so many
[42:16] applications there will be so many
[42:17] things that will be built on top of
[42:20] Bitcoin uh that they don't even know
[42:22] that they are using Bitcoin like actual
[42:26] Bitcoin in the back backround uh even
[42:28] like if if you buy an S&P 500 you're
[42:32] buying indirectly Bitcoin because Tesla
[42:34] is in the s&p500 and Tesla is buying
[42:37] Bitcoin not a lot uh and this will
[42:39] probably increase On's micro strategy
[42:42] and maybe other companies go S&P 500 and
[42:45] have an aggressive Bitcoin strategy but
[42:47] they don't know it
[42:49] like and how many people Pension funds
[42:53] how many Pension funds are going to buy
[42:54] Bitcoin yeah and the people they don't
[42:57] know they're putting money in their
[42:58] pension fund and it's actually going
[42:59] into Bitcoin some of it this will be so
[43:02] huge Bitcoin ETF allowed for all that to
[43:06] happen and uh is is do you have an
[43:11] opinion on the Bitcoin ETF uh from from
[43:13] your point of view of like uh from the
[43:16] Bible Bible point of view I I I think uh
[43:20] I don't know if it's necessarily a
[43:22] Biblical point of view I I just think
[43:25] this was going to happen
[43:28] eventually um it's just it's it's part
[43:31] of the process it's a step for
[43:33] Bitcoin
[43:35] um I mean you you could you couldn't
[43:37] stop it it's going to happen uh how it
[43:40] plays out in in the end I don't know I I
[43:43] tend to think like you Bitcoin is going
[43:44] to eat up the economy it's and and I see
[43:48] Bitcoin more as a trojan horse maybe ETF
[43:52] issuers think we can co-opt it but what
[43:55] what I think is going to end up
[43:56] happening is bitcoin's going Co-op them
[43:59] um they've they've let the animal in
[44:01] it's too late you can't control this
[44:04] thing um so that's how how I see it
[44:06] playing out um I think the ETF has some
[44:09] in this point in history some legitimate
[44:12] use cases like for example uh my wife uh
[44:15] is a nurse she got fired from her job
[44:18] for not taking the the ouchie fouchi and
[44:23] um so her pension was released to her to
[44:26] invest herself well what did we do
[44:30] Bitcoin ETF right no-brainer um so now
[44:33] her pension is
[44:34] outperforming by by a big
[44:37] margin her previous employer's pension
[44:41] fund so she was able to get into Bitcoin
[44:44] before her employer's pension fund
[44:46] allocates to it which they will
[44:49] eventually so it was a blessing in
[44:51] disguise right so I see so she she can't
[44:54] she can't uh realize those gains until
[44:57] she's 55 so it's locked in so well what
[45:01] do you do in that case well you you use
[45:04] the Bitcoin ETF right that's the only
[45:06] thing that makes sense so I see use
[45:08] cases like that um outside of that I
[45:13] don't know I don't really see much of a
[45:15] use for it myself um just get the real
[45:18] thing self custody but in situations
[45:21] like that I think it's a great option
[45:23] and it it it's it's I'm happy it's
[45:25] available because now her pen is is
[45:28] performing really well yeah everybody
[45:31] will have Bitcoin in their pension plan
[45:33] if you don't have it uh I mean I always
[45:36] say Bitcoin is your pension plan but uh
[45:39] for for people that are just slowly
[45:42] getting in or not don't get it now uh
[45:44] their pension planners will involve
[45:47] Bitcoin at some point if you don't uh
[45:50] include Bitcoin in your financial
[45:52] strategy you will get fired as a
[45:54] financial
[45:55] planner this time coming so it's it's
[45:58] it's very clear to me um last question
[46:01] on the Bitcoin and Bible um section um
[46:05] do you see then uh the Bitcoin white
[46:08] paper as kind of a Bible I mean it's the
[46:11] Bitcoin white paper is way smaller than
[46:13] the Bible and it's a faster read and a
[46:16] different read but uh do you see it kind
[46:18] of the the Bible that guides uh
[46:22] Bitcoin um not really I mean if you take
[46:27] if you take it literally Bible means
[46:28] library right and uh the white paper is
[46:31] just one you know if you want to call it
[46:34] the book it's one
[46:36] book so no I I don't really I don't
[46:39] really view it as a as a sort of a Bible
[46:41] or anything it's just I just view it as
[46:43] a sort of excuse me like I said Satoshi
[46:46] just released it he he didn't even know
[46:48] if it this thing would work so yeah I
[46:51] don't know I don't really think much
[46:53] about it to be honest yeah yeah
[46:55] interesting that's uh like a library so
[46:58] it would be like every Bitcoin book
[47:00] together uh would be then the Bible
[47:03] maybe you take all
[47:05] satoshi's Message Board posts put them
[47:07] all in one book then maybe have a sort
[47:10] of a library a Satoshi library but yeah
[47:14] so I guess the Bitcoin Bible is still uh
[47:17] we still have to uh write it has to be
[47:20] compiled we have to have a council where
[47:22] we determine which which writings are
[47:25] authentic which ones are not
[47:27] something like that uh perfect then
[47:30] before we get into the our end routine
[47:31] of the podcast uh what is like the most
[47:34] important message uh people readers from
[47:38] your book and listeners to that podcast
[47:41] uh should take away like what's the your
[47:43] message you want to get out uh on on
[47:45] this podcast or from your
[47:48] book The yeah good question the um the
[47:52] message I want to get out is is really
[47:54] simple Jesus is risen from the dead he
[47:58] really is and he's giving us this tool
[48:02] Bitcoin in order to bless all people of
[48:06] the Earth with a sound of money how many
[48:09] people are suffering in the world
[48:12] because of the Fiat system you live in
[48:15] the west you're privileged okay let's
[48:17] just face the facts we live in a
[48:19] financial system that has tremendous
[48:21] privilege because we're closest to the
[48:23] money printer but there's so many people
[48:26] in this world
[48:27] who are suffering and the only reason
[48:29] they're suffering not because they're
[48:30] lazy not because they're stupid they're
[48:33] suffering because the money they have is
[48:36] so inferior and broken that no matter
[48:39] how much they work they're still poor
[48:43] and the West is getting there Fiat money
[48:45] always gets there um but I I know people
[48:48] who come from Argentina who told me man
[48:52] we worked our butts off and and and oh
[48:55] you know they inflated so much it didn't
[48:57] matter it didn't matter um so my message
[49:01] is Jesus is giving us a tool to bring us
[49:04] back to the ancient ways in order for
[49:07] people
[49:08] to have a free and open economy where we
[49:12] can collaborate together to make a
[49:15] better world and
[49:18] um how this plays out from here I don't
[49:21] know I'm not a prophet I can't tell you
[49:24] but all I know is Christ is alive
[49:27] he's given us his word go out and spread
[49:30] it and I think Bitcoin is a tool it's
[49:33] interesting because I think in the
[49:34] future we won't have these conversations
[49:37] there won't be like hey Christians
[49:39] here's Bitcoin it's honest money you
[49:42] need to get this is going to be a time
[49:43] where this is going to be an irrelevant
[49:45] conversation because everyone will just
[49:46] use Bitcoin um so it's kind of strange
[49:50] for me to you know kind of work these
[49:51] two things together but this is the time
[49:54] we live in so um I I think for the
[49:57] future of humanity we need to have a
[50:00] good sound money and I think Christians
[50:02] as people of God should care about our
[50:08] neighbors uh enough to to fight for this
[50:11] thing and I like to call Bitcoin love
[50:13] your neighbor money because it's the
[50:16] money in the world uh that you can use
[50:18] that honors your neighbor and loves your
[50:20] neighbor and does not debase your
[50:23] neighbor's um labor yeah yeah and that's
[50:27] so true what you just said also with we
[50:29] don't we will not have these
[50:30] conversations in the future and I also
[50:32] think like that because when we have
[50:34] Bitcoin as the base layer of our
[50:36] financial system and this is what I
[50:38] write in all my BIOS I will talk about
[50:42] Bitcoin till it's the base layer of our
[50:44] financial system because at this point
[50:46] then it's boring yeah it's everywhere
[50:50] and it's just a base layer it's like
[50:53] talking about email protocols like the
[50:55] tcpip protocol of course it's
[50:57] fascinating technology and we could talk
[50:59] about all day long how dcpip is the Bas
[51:02] layer of of the internet internet and
[51:05] everything but who who cares like it's
[51:07] just it's just normal like everybody
[51:09] uses TCP and this is what Bitcoin also
[51:12] will be it will be boring it will be in
[51:14] everyday's life and uh it it will be
[51:17] great to have and uh yeah I think
[51:21] Bitcoin succeeds when no one talks about
[51:25] it right
[51:27] when Bitcoin succeeds when when my
[51:30] great-grandchildren look at this book
[51:32] and go wow I can't believe you had to
[51:33] write this like you know oh that's crazy
[51:37] um Bitcoin succeeds when no one talks
[51:39] about it when nobody cares about it
[51:41] because this is what I
[51:42] think Bitcoin does it if Bitcoin
[51:46] succeeds this is what it'll do in the
[51:47] world it will give people back their
[51:51] time to do what's really important with
[51:55] their life that's the whole point of
[51:59] hard of a hard sound money standard is
[52:01] so that human beings the image of God
[52:04] can use their time to do what's really
[52:07] important raise a family build the
[52:11] church serve their neighbors help the
[52:14] sick you know educate you know people
[52:18] like this is the important stuff in life
[52:21] um and we're having trouble with it
[52:24] because we're spending so much time
[52:26] trying to make money we're chasing this
[52:30] money that continually becomes more and
[52:33] more worthless so you have to spend more
[52:36] and more time and now you're neglecting
[52:38] the important things Bitcoin succeeds
[52:41] when no one talks about it and humans
[52:43] have more time to invest in the
[52:45] important things of life like church
[52:47] family and things like that that's when
[52:49] you know Bitcoin has succeeded yeah
[52:51] that's that's very true and very
[52:53] beautifully said uh do you have I mean
[52:56] that's impossible to predict but do you
[52:58] have like an an timeline where like oh
[53:00] it could happen in the next 10 years or
[53:02] it could happen in the next 200 years do
[53:04] you have like an idea where this
[53:07] adoption will go and when we will be
[53:12] there I don't know uh when you look at
[53:14] the adoption curve of other
[53:17] Technologies um it tends to be you know
[53:20] slow slow slow and then boom it just
[53:22] happens you like when I think about
[53:24] things like the cell phone when I was a
[53:27] teenager they're just coming out the
[53:29] flip phones and all that and the texting
[53:31] I remember you had the you had the the
[53:33] number pad and it took so long to send a
[53:35] text message and my girlfriend who's now
[53:37] my wife she would send text messages and
[53:39] I'm like how do you do that there's
[53:41] three letters per number I'm confused I
[53:43] don't know how to do this it's too much
[53:45] work but within five years 10 years
[53:50] everybody's sending text messages
[53:52] everyone's doing this thing my dad told
[53:54] me oh cell phones that don't never catch
[53:57] on that's stupid who wants to carry a
[53:59] phone everywhere they go right you know
[54:01] like what are you going to do you're
[54:02] going to call me when I'm at the grocery
[54:04] store I don't want to talk to you I want
[54:05] to go get my you know so this is the
[54:07] kind of but now he has a cell phone he
[54:09] has Facebook he's doing the texting he's
[54:11] doing the FaceTime he's doing so it just
[54:14] it's going to happen I think quick when
[54:17] when that when that suddenly happens I
[54:19] don't know I don't know I couldn't tell
[54:21] you but uh be prepared because it's
[54:24] going to go slow slow slow and then boom
[54:27] yeah there's I think there are lot lot
[54:29] of but there are a lot of studies on
[54:31] that and they study about how the
[54:34] internet got adopted how electricity got
[54:36] adopted how everything got adopted and
[54:39] usually it's like you need a long time
[54:41] for the first 10% you need like 10 15
[54:45] years for the first 10% at the same time
[54:48] you adopt the first 10% you get the next
[54:51] 80% to the 90% of adoption so we are now
[54:55] at round about 10% depends on how you
[55:00] calculate ad option and then what a
[55:03] Bitcoin is and who adopted Bitcoin but
[55:05] we're getting close to that number and a
[55:08] lot of people argue that it's happened
[55:10] in 2020 where we got to 10% I think uh
[55:13] we're not quite there yet uh so this
[55:16] inflection point Could Happen really
[55:19] soon and it will surprise a lot of
[55:22] people in 15 20 years how fast and how
[55:26] uh tremendous this technology changed
[55:29] our lives yeah so that's that's what I
[55:32] think uh and there there are a lot of
[55:34] studies on on
[55:36] numbers backing this those claims but
[55:39] the important thing is uh it will
[55:41] continue uh and with every bull cycle
[55:44] it's a little bit FAS do that few yeah
[55:48] and there's of course there's a learning
[55:49] curve but there's a learn there's a
[55:50] learning curve with every technology
[55:53] like the the personal computer the first
[55:55] time I got personal computer for
[55:57] Christmas A huet Packard big clunky you
[56:01] know the monitor weighed 50 lbs um but I
[56:04] was so fascinated by it you know I was
[56:06] like wow you
[56:08] can remember going to Napster remember
[56:10] Napster I don't know if how old you are
[56:12] you go to Napster and you could download
[56:14] music and it was like whoa you could
[56:17] just put in you know uh whatever music
[56:20] Rage Against the Machine and boom you
[56:21] could download it it was revolutionary
[56:24] of course they got sued by Metallica and
[56:25] all that but anyways
[56:28] um yeah so this thing is going to happen
[56:31] very quickly uh and I just tell people
[56:34] like just be ready for it because when
[56:36] it
[56:38] happens um it's it's it's it's going to
[56:42] happen quick and the like what was I
[56:46] going to say the
[56:48] um anyways I forgot I maybe I'll
[56:50] remember yeah and it's definitely uh we
[56:53] could even now be at the start of this
[56:57] uh super cycle that will bring something
[57:00] like I think uh we have now publicly
[57:03] traded companies in the Cycles uh since
[57:06] 2020 with micro strategy now 80 or
[57:09] something like that companies followed
[57:11] we have countries with El Salvador and
[57:14] other countries that are getting more
[57:16] and more uh friendly to bitcoin others
[57:19] not so but we're getting more and more
[57:21] into that uh and then uh we have now a
[57:24] Bitcoin ETF we have so much gold enough
[57:26] for Bitcoin then this could actually be
[57:31] uh the inflection point where we are
[57:33] going with on a crazy journey I mean
[57:35] Michael saor talked about this at the
[57:38] Bitcoin Atlantis that we now in a 10year
[57:40] gold rush to bitcoin and it could very
[57:43] well happen uh and it's it will be
[57:47] extremely interesting to see the next
[57:49] few years and I just suggest to everyone
[57:52] don't be on the
[57:54] sidelines and uh really really get into
[57:58] that uh Revolution that is just now
[58:00] happening so I remember what I was going
[58:02] to say what I was going to say was when
[58:04] you use
[58:07] Bitcoin it is very different at first
[58:10] it's very you got to learn but once you
[58:12] figure it out and you use it a little
[58:13] bit my experience has been when you go
[58:17] back to the bank it's so frustrating you
[58:20] know when I go to the bank now I feel
[58:23] like I'm using a fax machine or a
[58:26] typewriter you know I'm going in there
[58:28] and I'm like man this is so inefficient
[58:31] this system sucks it's so old and
[58:34] garbage and slow and in a like it's just
[58:37] not good so when you use Bitcoin and at
[58:40] first you're well this is different why
[58:42] would it work this way but then you use
[58:44] it you figure out you go well this is
[58:46] actually quite easy
[58:49] efficient uh trustworthy and then you go
[58:52] to the bank and you go wow this system
[58:54] sucks you know I owe a
[58:57] a friend of mine I ow I owe them a
[58:58] hundred bucks they bought me something
[58:59] from from the states and it's almost
[59:03] like dude just get figure out Bitcoin
[59:06] because I could just pay you back like
[59:08] this but now I have to go to the bank
[59:10] take out the cash give it to like oh
[59:13] guys get get with the program this Fiat
[59:16] system is so boring and slow and not
[59:20] efficient so when you start to use
[59:23] Bitcoin uh then it's almost like can't
[59:26] go back it's like sending an email and
[59:28] then someone's saying write me a letter
[59:29] and put it in the
[59:31] postage it's like well just get an email
[59:33] address and I could send you the
[59:35] information imagine if people were like
[59:37] that if they said um look I don't have
[59:40] an email address if you want to send me
[59:41] a note you got to write it on paper put
[59:44] an envelope put a stamp on it and go put
[59:46] it in the
[59:47] box that's what I feel like using the
[59:49] bank now I feel like I'm going to the
[59:51] post office to send you a letter and I
[59:53] think uh I think I don't remember who
[59:56] said it but our was it Andreas
[59:59] andonopoulos who said our kids will not
[60:02] use in depends of course how old your
[60:04] kids are and my kids are not on this
[60:07] earth right now so uh they will will
[60:10] come uh so like our kids will not use
[60:14] the banking system uh and they will not
[60:17] be like what is this and it's kind of
[60:19] like when you were talking about uh
[60:22] letters and stamps I never sent a letter
[60:26] I I would not even know how to do it I
[60:28] have no clue how to send a letter the
[60:31] only thing I did is uh sending back
[60:34] Amazon packages that's that's the most
[60:37] physical thing I do and I rarely do this
[60:40] because I don't cons I don't buy stuff
[60:42] that I don't need it I only send it back
[60:44] if it's like damaged or something uh so
[60:48] uh even that I rarely do uh so writing a
[60:52] letter is so strange for me uh and I
[60:56] think banks and this whole fat system
[61:00] will be for some some generations and
[61:03] depends on the timing uh what generation
[61:06] that will be will be so strange to them
[61:08] like what is this why do I have to wait
[61:11] fre business days to get transfer done
[61:15] why why can I not transfer money on a
[61:18] Saturday like happening I want I just
[61:21] want to send you money I can do this
[61:24] over WhatsApp like why why could you not
[61:27] do this so this is uh this will be a
[61:30] mass or or asking for permission that's
[61:32] my favorite one you go on oh can I get
[61:35] some money well what do you need it
[61:37] for what do you mean it's my money just
[61:41] give it to me like why you know you gota
[61:44] I think I think kyc these hardcore kyc
[61:47] requirements I hope for my children will
[61:49] be strange like well you have to give
[61:51] your you have to give them your driver's
[61:53] license before you uh open an account
[61:57] like
[61:58] what yeah that that would definitely be
[62:01] strange because a Bitcoin account you
[62:03] you can just open you just need a phone
[62:05] with a internet connection you like
[62:08] perfect and there even um I had an
[62:11] African Bitcoin on uh that provides
[62:14] service I forgot how it's called Uh that
[62:17] allows you to send and receive Bitcoin
[62:20] uh with just a phone number they are
[62:23] providing a centralized service where
[62:25] you can just provide a phone number and
[62:27] send Bitcoin to them and they have like
[62:29] a wallet and this is like something
[62:31] amazing because uh there are people
[62:34] without an internet connection there are
[62:37] more people with an internet connection
[62:39] in the phone than there are banked
[62:41] people so we are already above that
[62:45] potential but still there are people
[62:46] without an internet connection that
[62:48] don't have the luxury and even for those
[62:50] people there are services that they can
[62:53] use Bitcoin it's an amazing thing
[62:56] uh yeah and we are having an end routin
[62:59] in the podcast um where the previous
[63:02] guest asked a question for the next
[63:05] guest and this question is completely
[63:08] unrelated to anything we talked about
[63:10] today it's completely unrelated also to
[63:13] to bitcoin I don't know if you even have
[63:15] an opinion on that um when do you think
[63:18] will we colonize
[63:23] Mass um
[63:28] I don't know I I hope
[63:31] never uh because if we do then my
[63:34] assumption is we screwed up
[63:37] Earth um so I hope it gets to a point
[63:41] where the world humans can collaborate
[63:44] peacefully together to such a degree
[63:46] that we don't want to
[63:49] leave yeah so my hope is never but who
[63:53] knows th this is what I love about those
[63:56] ending questions because I don't tell
[63:59] the guest who's the next guest so uh the
[64:02] questions are completely random and
[64:05] sometimes they are suiting really well
[64:06] sometimes they're suiting not at
[64:09] all uh but it's always something
[64:11] something new and I I did that because
[64:15] like I tailor questions and topics for
[64:18] the guest so if the other one is also
[64:21] telling a question for the next guest
[64:23] then it's like it's the same so it's an
[64:26] interesting concept uh Pastor Alan it
[64:29] was amazing to have you on you have
[64:31] really really cool insights into the
[64:34] whole topic with fitcoin and the Bible i
[64:37] l your opinions on that and I hope we
[64:40] can we can talk in the future more um
[64:43] before I send you off where can uh
[64:46] people get in touch with you where can
[64:48] people ask you questions uh the best
[64:52] way best way is to just go to Twitter at
[64:56] coin I'm on there most uh most times DM
[65:00] me whatever just get in contact and yeah
[65:03] be happy the chat perfect uh thank you
[65:06] for being
[65:07] on thank you appreciate
[65:13] it
