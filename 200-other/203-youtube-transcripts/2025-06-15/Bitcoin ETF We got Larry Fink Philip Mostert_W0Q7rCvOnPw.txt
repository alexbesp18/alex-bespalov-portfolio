[00:00] now we've got that gorilla we've got
[00:01] Larry think and and the team a tulip is
[00:03] not divisible a tulip is not durable you
[00:06] know you keep a tulip I mean it's just
[00:07] it's at the nut actually a big big
[00:10] milestone the ETF printing machine gets
[00:12] switched on at some point it's perfect
[00:13] store that we fac it this is probably my
[00:15] my second or third cycle I've never been
[00:18] more bullish than I am right now because
[00:20] of all of these factors that are
[00:21] perfectly aligned if you short Bitcoin
[00:23] you short Humanity uh but the more I got
[00:26] exposure to web 3 the more my passion
[00:28] and love and belief system was
[00:31] reinforced in terms of what Bitcoin is
[00:33] what would we do right now without
[00:35] Bitcoin if your company is not
[00:37] optimizing to include at some point in
[00:39] the near future to either have Bitcoin
[00:42] on your asset balance book or accept
[00:44] Bitcoin as a means of exchange you are
[00:47] ultimately working towards
[00:50] zero so I think Ai and all all the
[00:54] helpers are really good at this point
[00:56] yeah good and bad I mean did you see the
[00:58] Michael sailor fake ads that all over
[01:00] YouTube yes it's it's scary but you know
[01:04] like I mean who who honestly are
[01:06] clicking on these ads and you know
[01:07] thinking that this is an exclusive offer
[01:09] you know from Michael saor it's just
[01:11] ridiculous so you know at the end of the
[01:13] day um with Bulls even in bears but I
[01:16] mean with Bulls come a lot of scammers
[01:18] so you just got to be extremely uh you
[01:20] know careful and cautious on what you're
[01:21] clicking and and you know what are you
[01:23] doing do your due diligence it's pretty
[01:25] it's going to get pretty scary I I I
[01:26] grow paranoid I mean I'm getting quite
[01:29] paranoid as it is
[01:30] um so you know anytime someone sends me
[01:32] a URL I always malware check it and make
[01:35] sure that everything's kosher and above
[01:36] board so yeah I think you know there's a
[01:38] lesson to be learned it's not it's
[01:40] definitely not my first bll so I know
[01:41] the scammers are coming I have a story
[01:44] my small cousin
[01:47] um he follows me on Twitter and he
[01:51] sometimes likes a lot of stuff on me
[01:53] from me uh really quickly like he's like
[01:56] one day he's in the one or two hours and
[01:58] he likes like the last two weeks of
[02:00] posts like he likes than 50 posts of
[02:03] mine in one one go and he got contacted
[02:08] by a scammer like this was the same
[02:10] profile as mine it was just like a
[02:12] different writing in the handle and I
[02:15] speak like I'm Austrian I always speak
[02:17] with him in uh
[02:20] German and the scammer wrote him in
[02:22] English because my content is English so
[02:25] uh and this did not uh threw the cousin
[02:29] off
[02:31] and he wrote with him like I think six
[02:34] messages and only after six he's really
[02:37] small like he's like 14 or something uh
[02:39] only after six messages he wrote me hey
[02:42] do you know that uh that's I that's me
[02:45] on on on on Twitter and I'm like I don't
[02:48] know what you're talking about and he
[02:50] sends me the screenshots and they really
[02:53] really really good like they are going
[02:54] slowly in they're like they're not like
[02:57] giving some we offer at the beginning
[02:59] they are trying to have a connection
[03:02] with the follower and the follower uh I
[03:05] think how it works like they're seeing
[03:07] how are they liking a lot of the stuff
[03:10] and then if they're liking a lot of the
[03:12] stuff and they're following then they're
[03:13] following it and messaging him in and
[03:16] they're hoping that in the rush of the
[03:18] moment uh they just can get through to
[03:21] him and build a connection and they
[03:23] don't even question if this the real one
[03:26] uh
[03:27] so there is a slight compliment in that
[03:30] though like you know you kind of made it
[03:31] in the Twitter space when you get cloned
[03:34] so I I haven't I haven't I haven't yet I
[03:36] don't think I've got any um you know
[03:38] fake accounts out there for myself uh
[03:41] but yeah I think you know you like 14 is
[03:45] is an age where obviously I'm glad that
[03:47] to hear that you kind of you have orange
[03:49] pulled him right so he's he's well aware
[03:51] of what what the importance that Bitcoin
[03:53] has to play um but you the sooner they
[03:56] learn these lessons on on the potential
[03:58] you know issues and risks that comes
[04:00] with you know self- custody and all
[04:01] these other things that we are are
[04:03] eventually going to take more and more
[04:04] control over the hus is on you to
[04:06] protect yourself you know and um I think
[04:09] at at some point in the near future I'm
[04:11] most likely going to you know reduce my
[04:13] digital footprint you know down to a
[04:15] bare minimum um because it is it is
[04:17] going to get very difficult and as
[04:19] technology like you know like we were
[04:20] talking about AI as technology gets more
[04:23] advanced it's going to become a massive
[04:24] issue um and I I fear obviously and we
[04:27] can talk about the ETF I know you've got
[04:28] a little bit of a uh a position on the
[04:30] ETF but I feel like you know the older
[04:32] Generations they are sitting ducks you
[04:34] know metaphorically speaking um you know
[04:37] they they they sit there they are
[04:38] heavily reliant on you know very old
[04:41] outdated ways of interacting with their
[04:42] banking you know fraternities um and uh
[04:46] I mean I'm talking from a personal
[04:47] experience I've got I've got fairly
[04:48] older parents they're in there my
[04:50] father's in his 80s and he gets calls
[04:52] sometimes from you know so-call Bankers
[04:54] uh and they they are asking him for you
[04:56] know really personal information he
[04:58] panics like like what you know your
[05:00] cousin hope you know thankfully didn't
[05:02] do they put a certain amount of pressure
[05:04] in it and they and they just you know
[05:06] dispense all this really personal um you
[05:09] know information which is dangerous but
[05:11] I so you know I think it's uh as we get
[05:13] into more like I said self- custodial
[05:15] environment we just the onus is really
[05:17] up to you because you've got no
[05:18] middleman to lean on and say Hey you
[05:21] know what's up there's no insurance
[05:23] provider in the middle protecting you
[05:24] from you know the loss and theft and all
[05:26] that kind of stuff so um you just need
[05:28] to be highly vigilant um you know going
[05:30] into to what I think is going to be very
[05:32] exciting next few years and and Beyond
[05:35] will ever will all the people do self
[05:38] custody will uh be the future where
[05:42] because I think a lot about that I think
[05:44] a lot of people the masses will still
[05:46] have Bitcoin in on some exchanges on
[05:49] some trading platform banking platform
[05:52] on maybe even not layer one like layer
[05:54] two three four five 10 whatever uh and
[05:58] only a small percenters have really
[06:00] Bitcoin on on chain is that also your
[06:02] thought yeah ABS 100% And I think this
[06:05] is why there is this massive opportunity
[06:07] with the ETFs right so you know to to um
[06:11] move forward uh which is a you know
[06:13] principle of um uh physics to move
[06:16] forward you need to leave something
[06:17] behind and I think these atfs are an
[06:19] ideal opportunity for the majority of
[06:22] the the um you know Mass adoption out
[06:25] there to get involved and have some
[06:27] exposure to bitcoin you know I think
[06:29] there will be in eventually we're going
[06:31] to get into an environment where there
[06:32] might be a healthy you know split
[06:34] between the custodial management
[06:37] responsibilities but the large majority
[06:40] are not right um and I think that's
[06:42] absolutely fine uh for the medium short
[06:44] term um and I think you know why I I'm
[06:47] excited about these ETFs is not
[06:49] necessarily um you know it's not about
[06:51] the technology it's not necessarily
[06:53] movement towards you know um a better
[06:55] consensus uh on you know on the protocol
[06:58] it is about Mass ad option and about you
[07:00] know awareness of the importance of what
[07:02] this means um I think a lot of ETF um
[07:05] you know especially a younger ETF
[07:07] investors they will start to learn more
[07:10] about the importance of what uh for me I
[07:13] I believe is the single most uh
[07:15] important technological and societal uh
[07:18] you know movement that we've had in the
[07:19] last couple years um I think this those
[07:22] younger investors are going to start
[07:24] going okay well what is this all about
[07:25] and they're going to go down the rabbit
[07:27] hole like we've all gone down the rabbit
[07:29] hole like you know um I'm obviously I'm
[07:31] talking to a fellow Bitcoin so you know
[07:34] once they go down that Journey they will
[07:36] eventually get and buy direct you know
[07:38] they will they'll buy and own and store
[07:39] their own coins so um this is a a vital
[07:43] uh stepping stone into that you know
[07:45] greater adoption and I think we we're
[07:48] now going to regardless of the quality
[07:49] of the ads that have come out you know
[07:51] around the ETF which are in my opinion
[07:53] poing but anyway um we we're now being
[07:56] given this this massive opportunity to
[07:59] Market uh Bitcoin to a global audience
[08:02] um and you know it's obviously the first
[08:04] stab of these ads I don't know how
[08:05] authentic some of these ads are I think
[08:07] they maybe you know um done off I mean
[08:10] some of these ads look like they've done
[08:11] been done off PowerPoint um but it's a
[08:13] step in the right direction regardless
[08:15] of the quality right so like you know
[08:17] you know you have to um sometimes just
[08:20] make sure that you're moving forward and
[08:22] I you know I applied that to my own
[08:24] career regardless of you make mistakes
[08:26] along the way as long as you're learning
[08:27] you're moving forward you're progressing
[08:29] this for me is a vital step into a mass
[08:32] um you know level of exposure that we
[08:34] haven't had in the last you know 15
[08:36] years or so this is now a significant uh
[08:39] movement towards being taken seriously
[08:41] at at the financial dinner table um
[08:44] black rock is one of the biggest if not
[08:46] the biggest companies in the world they
[08:48] uh you know the flight flight to Quality
[08:50] is is every on everyone's lips you know
[08:52] you've got that you need that level of
[08:54] authority to also then have the right
[08:57] discussions with the government you know
[08:59] if you don't have the gorilla on your
[09:01] side you are likely going to lose the
[09:03] discussion we have lost the discussion
[09:05] for the last you know number of years um
[09:07] but now we've got that gorilla we've got
[09:09] Larry think and and the team on our like
[09:12] theoretically on our side regardless if
[09:14] you know if it's it's direct exposure or
[09:15] not but they they have that financial
[09:18] interest now in in place so if we share
[09:22] that common financial and and
[09:24] technological interest of um you know
[09:27] moving moving this movement forward now
[09:29] we've got a significant partner if you
[09:31] want to call it a partner but we've got
[09:33] that significant weights on our side to
[09:35] make sure that the right doors the
[09:37] rights um you know influences created at
[09:39] at government level um but it's you know
[09:42] then we we we go into an interesting
[09:44] there will always be this jle right no
[09:46] government I don't think governments are
[09:49] going to let this happen easily because
[09:52] you know the old saying is is power
[09:55] corrupts you know beautifully and
[09:56] perfectly um I don't think there's going
[10:00] to be many examples of governments that
[10:01] are just going to say you know brilliant
[10:03] fantastic let's adopt this let's you
[10:05] know it's not going to happen that way
[10:07] because they are in control and you know
[10:10] obviously I'm going to watch what I say
[10:11] because I don't want to be you know like
[10:12] come across as the as a as an anarchist
[10:15] and and you know along those lines um
[10:18] but they are in control and they're not
[10:20] going to relinquish that control easily
[10:22] um why would they you know they're um
[10:25] regardless of of um their agenda
[10:29] maybe it's also high level of naivity or
[10:32] misunderstanding I mean you still got
[10:33] these world famous economists you know
[10:36] quoting the or comparing it to the Tulip
[10:38] bubble you know um phenomena and you you
[10:41] sit there going like I I mean I I
[10:44] approach Bitcoin purely from uh not
[10:46] necessarily only but purely from an
[10:49] economic point of Economist point of
[10:51] view right the new principles of
[10:53] economics and it doesn't take a rocket
[10:56] scientist to differentiate the the two
[10:59] between what is this absolute scarce
[11:01] item that is highly portable that is
[11:05] divisible that is durable you know all
[11:08] these qualities that that has you know
[11:10] defined what currency and and you know
[11:12] store of value and all these sort of
[11:13] things have have taken shape and and
[11:15] what the market needs it doesn't take a
[11:17] genius to say but a tulip isn't that you
[11:21] know a tulip is not divisible a tulip is
[11:24] not durable you know you keep a tulip I
[11:26] mean it's just it's at the nut so so I I
[11:29] I always go back to the point is either
[11:31] they are highly incompetent
[11:36] and questionable you know their IQ is
[11:39] questionable or there's an agenda behind
[11:41] it or they're being told or paid to say
[11:43] something you know or you know push a
[11:45] certain narrative that um that fuels an
[11:49] agenda of someone you know or some
[11:50] entity so you know it it's we haven't
[11:53] won the battle yet and I don't think you
[11:55] know like whenever whenever this happens
[11:57] and we either get approved or denied and
[11:59] or delayed or whatever the story we
[12:00] haven't won the battle yet it's not it's
[12:02] not a matter of all of us being
[12:03] completely self- Sovereign now you know
[12:05] it's not going to be that issue we it's
[12:07] still a number of things that we need to
[12:09] go through but it's a big SM I think
[12:11] it's actually a big big milestone the
[12:13] ETF as you said um we had like I think
[12:17] one of the major Milestone is obviously
[12:19] like the Genesis block and stuff like
[12:21] that and the first pizza transaction
[12:23] where Bitcoin got a market but then
[12:25] moving on it was like um maybe Michael
[12:28] sailor was Big Moment the first public
[12:30] company a publicly traded company that
[12:32] bought Bitcoin El Salvador was also big
[12:35] step like the first nation state to
[12:37] having a president to embrace Bitcoin in
[12:39] the way he did uh that was a major
[12:42] Milestone and I think like the Milestone
[12:45] just got way bigger like publicly traded
[12:47] company brought so many more publicly
[12:50] traded companies like I think they like
[12:51] 80 or something now from 2020 there was
[12:54] only one the first one and now nation
[12:57] states and there talks with other nation
[12:59] state and and like with Argentina and
[13:01] more nation state they're flirting with
[13:04] it and they're getting more Pro Bitcoin
[13:07] and now with the ETF uh it's it's a
[13:10] whole new ball game it's sometimes
[13:12] people say oh but it's we have spot ETFs
[13:15] uh we have uh different like people can
[13:17] get exposure to bitcoin other ways but
[13:20] people don't realize how much capital
[13:22] and eyeballs this is unlocking like it's
[13:26] staggering like only the if only blackr
[13:30] invests like 1% of their Capital if yeah
[13:33] only black is it like it's the daily buy
[13:35] volume will dble easily like I was
[13:38] having a podcast I think two or three
[13:40] weeks ago and we were calculating the
[13:42] numbers and it was so easily tribling
[13:45] the daily buy volume and then we also
[13:47] have the having year the same year which
[13:50] is beautiful to have in the same so like
[13:53] it it's it's amazing step what do you
[13:55] think and and and interest rates and
[13:58] interest rates a lot likely going to
[13:59] drop and the printing you know the
[14:01] printing machine gets switched on at
[14:02] some point you know I think this is it's
[14:05] ultimately it's a perfect storm that
[14:07] we're facing which I've never been and
[14:09] this is probably my my second or third
[14:11] cycle I've never been more bullish than
[14:14] I am right now because of all of these
[14:16] factors that are perfectly aligned like
[14:18] okay let's first get through the first
[14:19] hurdle and all that kind of stuff but it
[14:20] is a very exciting time to be in Bitcoin
[14:23] extremely exciting you know um and I I I
[14:26] for one and I'm sure you you're probably
[14:28] the same as me I can't shut up about it
[14:31] you know I talk about it
[14:33] 247 I I am living and I'm breathing and
[14:36] I'm you know developing content and
[14:38] anyone that will listen you know I'm
[14:40] talking about it you know I was I I TW
[14:42] tweeted about this but it's not it's not
[14:44] a joke this actually happened to me I
[14:45] was invited to an new Eve party on a
[14:48] prerequisite on a one term that I
[14:50] wouldn't talk about Bitcoin so I was
[14:53] like yeah enjoy your evening CU there's
[14:56] no ways I mean for me it's not it's not
[14:58] talking about Bitcoin per se it's not
[14:59] about you know the coin value or the
[15:02] technology Bitcoin touches on every
[15:04] facet of Our Lives it touches on our
[15:07] social dynamics you know it touches on
[15:09] our economic Dynamics our financial
[15:11] Dynamics it talks about equality it
[15:13] talks about a social movement that is so
[15:17] much more powerful than it is just a
[15:19] financial you know vehicle it it is
[15:22] about at the end of the day it's about
[15:25] freedom and you know the more we have
[15:28] these players like lagard and and you
[15:30] know these these Central quite nefarious
[15:33] entities you know sitting in in the EU
[15:35] uh various different departments and
[15:37] they're talking about cbdcs and they're
[15:39] talking about these very evil my in my
[15:42] opinion evil potential evil weapons that
[15:44] can be used to control a an agenda you
[15:47] know agenda from a central Force um you
[15:51] know there is this dystopian fear that I
[15:53] think that everyone has you know we can
[15:54] go either way right we've always been in
[15:56] that scenario I think in in society
[15:58] we've always been on this edge of like
[16:00] you know ultimate um Doom and Gloom you
[16:03] know the the the the hour clock is
[16:05] pointing at 12 and we're always thinking
[16:07] you know is it is it going to end and
[16:08] all that stuff but I think we we're in a
[16:10] different situation now because we have
[16:12] the technology that can actually provide
[16:14] means to control a mass you know a mass
[16:18] population um and Bitcoin is the opt out
[16:21] of that it is the um for me again like I
[16:25] talk about it when when you know I I get
[16:27] so excited about these things because as
[16:29] me it's not about not only about a
[16:31] financial and economic you know movement
[16:34] that's happening but it is at the end of
[16:35] the day our option of Salvation it is
[16:40] you wrote in one tweet I I loved it so
[16:42] much that if you short Bitcoin you short
[16:46] Humanity 100% yeah 100% that that you're
[16:49] not in the Bitcoin game there if you're
[16:51] shorting it I'm you you're just you're
[16:53] dgen and you're trading it and you're
[16:55] looking at a selfish means for a fat
[16:56] purpose right and
[16:59] um look I'm not a smart enough Trader
[17:01] and I don't trade for for the record I
[17:03] don't do leverage and all that kind of
[17:04] stuff but if you short Bitcoin you are
[17:07] going to eventually get knocked out um
[17:10] and and but philosophically you are
[17:13] shorting our our our potential to to
[17:16] have a thriving you know utopian future
[17:18] or whatever that looks like you know
[17:20] returning to a hard currency um so I
[17:22] don't I don't respect anyone who shorts
[17:24] you know like uh we we don't have to
[17:26] talk about the most famous one in the
[17:27] market um
[17:29] but you know I don't respect anyone who
[17:30] shorts Bitcoin
[17:31] because you you know that is the most
[17:34] selfish thing that you can possibly do
[17:35] right now it's most selfish thing that
[17:37] you can
[17:38] do will it ever be uh too late to learn
[17:41] about Bitcoin like it's uh stage where
[17:45] it's be it's GNA be too late for
[17:48] people no because I ask you is it is it
[17:51] today is it too late to learn about fat
[17:54] is it too late to learn about what money
[17:56] is no it's not right um I went down this
[17:58] Rabbit Hole I was fortunate to get in
[18:00] early but I only started becoming a
[18:02] proper student of Bitcoin in the last 2
[18:05] years 3 years so I you know I've read
[18:07] now several books I'm I'm 40 turning 43
[18:10] soon um I'm I'm not I'm not a young
[18:12] person anymore you know I'm I'm um I'm
[18:16] I'm still a student though it's never
[18:18] too late to learn um I use my parents as
[18:22] a sounding board um because you know if
[18:24] I can appeal and if they can understand
[18:26] what I'm talking about and they like
[18:27] hearing what you know obviously maybe
[18:29] it's bias but if they um if they
[18:32] understand what I'm talking about and
[18:33] they are now all singing the song of the
[18:36] importance of why Bitcoin needs to you
[18:37] know uh be saved uh not saved but it
[18:40] needs to you know um become a forward um
[18:45] Topic in any household
[18:48] um they're in their 70s and 80s it's
[18:51] never too late to learn so um I think
[18:55] the more the movement um G gathers
[18:58] momentum and these ETFs will will will
[19:01] um will expedite that that willingness
[19:04] and openness to learn the more people
[19:06] like you and me and and uh of course
[19:09] we're not at the same scale like Bitcoin
[19:10] archive you know that you're talking
[19:12] about 1.4 million followers or something
[19:15] um but there are massive accounts out
[19:17] there I think okay so let's go back to
[19:20] there for me there is mining first and
[19:24] foremost right uh transaction
[19:26] verification and everything else and
[19:27] block security
[19:28] then there is actually buying and
[19:30] storing Bitcoin those are the two most
[19:33] like important proponents of Bitcoin the
[19:36] third for me the third proponent which
[19:38] is what I'm trying to spend most of my
[19:40] time doing because I'm not a minor yet
[19:42] and I might potentially do that um and
[19:44] I'm a holder right so that's okay but
[19:46] the third most important component of
[19:48] Bitcoin is
[19:49] education it is it's 100% education and
[19:52] it's a it's a really fun topic well I
[19:54] find it fun and I think people when I
[19:56] when I do talk to them their eyes light
[19:58] up because I'm excited about what I'm
[19:59] talking about um it is a very fun topic
[20:02] because again it's not a it's not a
[20:04] financial you know um it's not only a
[20:06] financial accounting best practices and
[20:08] all that kind of stuff when you're
[20:09] looking at numbers sure you can look at
[20:11] it from number number perspective but
[20:13] it's not you you know um it's really
[20:16] about again the societal impact
[20:19] Prosperity that the individual will be
[20:21] able to maintain uh when they go down
[20:23] this Bitcoin Rabbit Hole um so no I to
[20:26] answer your question it's definitely not
[20:27] too late to
[20:29] um it's never even it will never even be
[20:32] too late to buy you know the old saying
[20:35] again is um you get Bitcoin at the price
[20:37] you deserve um and I just think that
[20:39] we're so early we are soly so early it's
[20:41] never going to stop going up eventually
[20:43] you know there will be cycles and are we
[20:45] entering a super cycle right now uh
[20:47] likely but um it's an exciting space to
[20:51] be in um and it is really something like
[20:55] you know uh that gives me purpose and I
[20:57] I'm pretty happy that I've I've come
[20:59] across this because um yeah I've never
[21:02] felt like I've had more purpose in my
[21:04] life you know I wake up and I go yeah
[21:06] this is
[21:07] it you also wrote that in your bu that
[21:10] you have to go to orange pill a thousand
[21:12] people like um maybe to start with uh
[21:16] how did you get orange
[21:18] build yeah it's a great question I I
[21:20] even remember when I first heard about
[21:22] it um and I was I even remember the road
[21:25] that I was driving in it was in 2010
[21:29] um and I heard it on the radio and they
[21:31] were talking about on the radio and I
[21:32] was like okay yeah what is this all
[21:34] about but it never really you know it
[21:36] never really became a um it wasn't a a
[21:39] significant important factor in my life
[21:41] um I had still yet a lot of things in in
[21:44] a professional sense to achieve and I I
[21:46] lived all around the world I traveled I
[21:48] stayed in Asia for about 10 years um and
[21:50] in
[21:51] 2017 uh I was working with a colleague
[21:53] um and he
[21:55] um um actually our company was was
[21:58] founded by a fairly well-known
[21:59] individual in in the crypto and Bitcoin
[22:02] space Vinnie lingam um I don't know if
[22:05] you know Vinnie Lingham but he's also
[22:06] quite a large influence in the market um
[22:08] and hell of a smart guy and he started
[22:10] our company uh many years back and he's
[22:13] exited you know subsequently but he was
[22:15] a very early adopter of of Bitcoin and
[22:18] crypto um and he was quite influential
[22:21] with with me um you know I I followed
[22:23] all of his posts and I started getting a
[22:25] better understanding of what he was
[22:26] talking about he was always early Trend
[22:28] spotter um so he was very important in
[22:32] me uh learning or get you know being
[22:35] introduced to bitcoin initially and
[22:37] initially in 2017 I I I looked at it
[22:39] purely from a speculative or at that
[22:41] time it was about $600 or something um
[22:44] and I thought okay let me put you know
[22:45] let me put some money down and see where
[22:46] it goes with it and I remember the
[22:48] various different exchanges even in 2017
[22:50] in Asia it wasn't easy to get we had to
[22:52] go to a number of different weird and
[22:54] wonderful you know exchanges and
[22:55] eventually move things over to to uh to
[22:58] a hardware wallet um but that was when
[23:01] my journey started and I went through
[23:03] this whole kind of iteration of you know
[23:05] then the then ethereum the fork uh
[23:07] obviously happened um and we were
[23:09] talking about that for a while and then
[23:10] that spurred a horrible movement the Ico
[23:13] movement you know the initial coin
[23:14] offering movement and the scams came
[23:17] with that and the flood of of fraudulent
[23:19] activity came around that um and that's
[23:22] when I started thinking what this is
[23:23] just like surely this is just printing
[23:25] money right so all these guys are just
[23:27] developing these tokens and these
[23:29] initial coin offerings and stuff and
[23:30] they're just printing money it's not
[23:32] solving any world issues um and I was
[23:35] I've always been kind of like a romantic
[23:36] idealist in a sense where I want to make
[23:38] the world a better place uh for for
[23:41] everyone and obviously future
[23:42] Generations but every every career that
[23:45] I've had I've always had that drive to
[23:46] make leave the world in a better place
[23:48] leave my environment U you know better
[23:51] than than when it when I started out in
[23:53] it um and I didn't really see the Ico
[23:56] movement having any benefit benefit for
[23:58] the the you know the average person on
[24:00] the street I thought this is purely just
[24:02] a money grab uh but anyway there might
[24:04] be some money to be made so I didn't
[24:06] really take it that seriously um and
[24:08] then a few years later um and I was
[24:10] always still in Bitcoin I was you know
[24:12] you know early investor holder um but it
[24:16] was always back of my mind I you know I
[24:18] thought I had to do other things and I
[24:20] did I was working with a a really large
[24:22] Bank in in Asia standard charted Bank um
[24:25] and I was working about uh across about
[24:28] different markets um and it was great in
[24:30] crazy time and all that stuff but at the
[24:32] bank I was um learning some interesting
[24:35] lessons about Banking and and finance
[24:37] and credit and you know because we were
[24:40] selling credit cards and personal loans
[24:41] and stuff right so we were selling uh
[24:43] short-term uh credit uh facilities um
[24:47] and and um the bank strategy was
[24:49] obviously to talk to or tap into and
[24:51] Target Emerging Markets Emerging Markets
[24:53] are
[24:54] um you know high demand for credit um
[24:58] you know but then that off that
[25:00] introduces a certain level of risk uh it
[25:02] didn't pan out necessarily too well for
[25:04] for the bank um you know I think it was
[25:05] in 2017 or so uh the bank went through a
[25:08] little bit of a hiccup but that was also
[25:09] broadly related to a wider financial
[25:11] crisis um and that's when I started to
[25:14] get a better you know sense of what I
[25:16] need to do with my life and my career um
[25:19] and it wasn't about offering credit
[25:20] short-term credit that might be uh
[25:23] detrimental to the Family household it
[25:25] was something that wasn't feeding my
[25:26] soul um and I needed to find what that
[25:29] was and I went down this whole like
[25:31] ecological route and I still do to a
[25:32] degree of you know conservation and
[25:34] Recycling and all that Stu and and
[25:36] living in Asia is uh it's pretty
[25:38] daunting because of the the onetime you
[25:40] know packaging usage the plastic usage
[25:43] uh is incredible um so I sometimes walk
[25:46] out outside my building and there would
[25:47] be these you know uh six foot high piles
[25:50] of trash you know on the streets waiting
[25:51] for the collection services to come and
[25:53] that sort of you makes you think um you
[25:55] know there has to be a better solution
[25:56] to that um so but but then um you know
[26:00] in 2020 we went through all the similar
[26:02] you know pandemic around the world
[26:04] lockdowns happened and then defi started
[26:06] taking shape um and then you know nft
[26:08] started taking shape um and I went down
[26:11] that path and I decided this was a great
[26:13] opportunity for me to try pivot my
[26:15] career from a uh a marketing digital
[26:18] marketing uh you know Financial
[26:20] background uh having worked with Google
[26:22] and Facebook and and large Banks
[26:24] throughout Asia I thought okay let me
[26:25] pivot try pivot my career into a more of
[26:28] a cryptocurrency environment more
[26:30] blockchain environment because I was
[26:32] applying this idealistic nature of going
[26:35] bit you know um not Bitcoin but uh
[26:37] blockchain can can level the playing
[26:39] field right we can we can offer uh or
[26:41] smart Contracting can offer a a
[26:44] opportunity to own a piece of the
[26:45] internet right um so I thought okay this
[26:48] is something I need to take seriously
[26:50] and I started working in in in web 3 uh
[26:53] a couple years ago uh but the more I got
[26:56] exposure to web 3 the more my passion
[26:59] and love and and belief system was
[27:02] reinforced in terms of what Bitcoin is
[27:05] and that's it's been so easy for me to
[27:07] differentiate the two split the two
[27:09] Bitcoin is not crypto in my opinion it's
[27:11] not it's not web3 um there might be a
[27:14] definition blur when it comes to layer
[27:16] two solutions uh we can talk about that
[27:18] for a little bit but Bitcoin for me is
[27:21] is one of the greatest most scarce
[27:23] assets uh you know on the planet there
[27:25] isn't a um an individual behind it or a
[27:27] VCS behind it looking for exit liquidity
[27:31] um it is uh there was no token issued
[27:33] you know upon initiation uh it was you
[27:37] had to work for it and for me it is a
[27:39] it's an a perfect beautiful model of
[27:41] converting energy into a means of stored
[27:44] currency and value what other resource
[27:48] or what other process out there has the
[27:50] ability to turn energy into an immediate
[27:53] form of currency and value you know
[27:55] there's not a single one that you can
[27:58] you can list that um doesn't require
[28:01] necessarily you know um a value chain of
[28:04] middlemen along the way extracting
[28:06] margins and extracting you know um and I
[28:09] talk about extracting value because it's
[28:10] definitely not contributing value they
[28:12] just you know siphoning off all that
[28:14] value uh that is created in this chain
[28:17] um so I have uh pretty much come to the
[28:21] conclusion that it is
[28:24] Bitcoin uh or or none um it needs to um
[28:29] resonate it needs to basically you know
[28:33] percolate with with most uh young minds
[28:36] and I believe that Bitcoin is going to
[28:38] be taught in universities um and it's
[28:41] going to be taught in in schools um and
[28:43] the sooner we learn about these
[28:44] fundamentals or new principles of
[28:46] economics the better new principles of
[28:48] Technology the better um and yeah I do
[28:52] believe that uh it's going to be an
[28:54] exciting future um and I thank my lucky
[28:58] stars and I'm sure everyone else thanks
[29:00] their lucky stars that Bitcoin was
[29:01] invented because we would not be in the
[29:03] situation today if it wasn't the case if
[29:05] if Satoshi did not invent this you know
[29:08] during the the 200 um was it 2007 crisis
[29:12] 2008 financial crisis uh we would be in
[29:14] a very very very desperate situation
[29:17] right now we would be very very it would
[29:19] be scary I would not want to be on this
[29:21] planet right yeah it's a hard question
[29:23] like what would we do right now uh
[29:26] without Bitcoin I mean I did before
[29:29] Bitcoin a lot of Stock Investing like I
[29:31] spent my days from basically 10 pm to 2
[29:37] am researching about stocks and I did
[29:39] really great actually uh but it's it's a
[29:42] work it's it's not a savings device it's
[29:45] it's an actual side hustle it's a job
[29:47] it's it's something you do investing is
[29:49] is not saving and storing energy it's
[29:52] it's it's a it's an actual job and so I
[29:56] I have no clue because gold of course
[29:58] it's gold is is is an amazing store of
[30:01] value it has an amazing history but I
[30:04] don't know if I would invest my money or
[30:07] save my money in Gold if if there was no
[30:09] no Bitcoin like it's a hard question for
[30:11] me actually what what would I do without
[30:14] Bitcoin or would I even think about that
[30:16] question right now because a lot of
[30:18] things uh uh opened my like Bitcoin
[30:21] opened a lot of uh questions and topics
[30:24] for me uh so I never questioned what is
[30:27] money before Bitcoin and I was I was a
[30:30] big stock investor a really big one I
[30:33] made huge gains and I did never ever
[30:36] question what is money actually and this
[30:39] this scares me like what I mean luckily
[30:43] we have it uh but what if we don't have
[30:47] it um that but that is why the Matrix uh
[30:51] you know the Matrix memes and M Matrix
[30:53] um comparison is so important I I'm
[30:56] exact like you the second you go down
[30:59] this rabbit hole You you really do start
[31:01] to become enlightened to a degree you
[31:05] know you start you start to become hyper
[31:07] sensitive towards all of these macro and
[31:10] micro um nuanced challenges that we face
[31:13] in society and we would have never been
[31:16] asking these questions if we didn't have
[31:18] this option of of uh you know Bitcoin
[31:20] and education around it we would we
[31:21] would all be sitting with our blinkers
[31:23] on and we would just take it we would
[31:24] just accept that this is the norm this
[31:25] is the reality that's been provided
[31:28] um and yeah I mean thank God it's a life
[31:31] that we've got um and um it's our job to
[31:34] basically make sure that everyone
[31:36] understands that there are options out
[31:37] there um but it also it's terrifying at
[31:40] the same time because the more we
[31:41] realize how bad the situation is right
[31:44] there's a borderline there between
[31:46] becoming a um an obsessive conspiracy
[31:49] theorist right um and I am probably a
[31:51] little bit of a conspiracy theorist I
[31:53] believe that there are certain things
[31:55] that are are not very coos and against
[31:57] us but the more I understand about what
[32:00] situation we're facing the more I I
[32:03] actually grow terrified for
[32:04] organizations companies and countries
[32:07] who are not planning accordingly like if
[32:10] if your company is not optimizing to
[32:12] include at some point in the near future
[32:15] to either have Bitcoin on your asset
[32:17] balance book your balance sheet or
[32:20] accept Bitcoin as a means of you know uh
[32:24] exchange you are ultimately working
[32:26] towards
[32:28] zero because the currency that you're
[32:30] accepting regardless of your local
[32:33] currency is all backed by something like
[32:36] a dollar or a gold Reserve or not not
[32:38] even a gold Reserve but like a dollar or
[32:40] some sort of you know uh GDP metric that
[32:43] is rubbish because it's not measuring a
[32:45] lot of you know the you know in informal
[32:47] sectors and stuff it is dangerous for an
[32:50] organization Maybe not today maybe not
[32:52] this year or in the next two years but
[32:54] is a it is dangerous for an organization
[32:56] and Country country more over a country
[32:59] not to be planning accordingly if
[33:02] Bitcoin isn't a topic of discussion at
[33:05] board meetings and at parliamentary
[33:09] sessions your country is going to be
[33:11] left
[33:12] behind because like you've got Saudi
[33:15] Arabia you know now that it's Halal and
[33:17] you've got like you said Al salvad or
[33:19] you've got Honduras that has also now
[33:21] recently made it a legal tender
[33:23] Argentina let's see like I know everyone
[33:26] was going about you know he's a Bitcoin
[33:28] president stuff he made one comment that
[33:30] he was you know open to the idea and
[33:32] stuff so let's see how that pans out and
[33:34] yes they have made a legal tender and
[33:35] stuff let's see how that plans out and
[33:37] inflation is through the roof it yeah
[33:39] Reserve you know the Federal Reserve
[33:41] Bank let's let's let's see how that
[33:42] plans out but a country that is not
[33:45] planning for this according is going to
[33:46] get dramatically and very quickly left
[33:48] behind it is going to be a niche
[33:51] knee-jerk reaction because there's one
[33:54] thing for me that is inevitably going to
[33:56] pop
[33:58] and that's the
[33:59] USD right and if you look at USD
[34:03] reserves in most of these countries they
[34:05] are heavy reliant on a USD form of
[34:11] um of assuring their their local
[34:14] currency and that for me is very very
[34:16] dangerous I mean the USD is basically
[34:19] the the strongest and most reliable fat
[34:23] currency but I also think it will
[34:26] eventually just pop so if you're not
[34:29] planning to have as you said a strategy
[34:32] for Bitcoin you will lose out and will
[34:37] like I the time is really tricky for me
[34:40] because will fear survive the next 50
[34:43] years like we already went when we take
[34:46] the start of
[34:47] 1971 uh then we already went over 50
[34:51] years and if went 50 years maybe we can
[34:53] do another 50 years can it can can go
[34:56] another 50 years yes do you think no no
[34:58] if you look at your inflation I mean
[35:00] what how much value has lost in the Euro
[35:02] and the USD in the last 20 years right
[35:04] it's it's virtually 90% how much more of
[35:08] that room is there to
[35:10] decline in 20 years 90% value loss
[35:13] nothing there's not a lot of time there
[35:15] right we understand that um and um but
[35:18] the majority don't realize how bad
[35:20] inflation is because the numbers that
[35:21] are being reported are wrong um I talked
[35:24] to a lot you know a lot of locals where
[35:26] I where I located and I asked them you
[35:28] know the the number that's being
[35:30] reported is like
[35:32] 0.6% inflation where I'm based and I
[35:36] asked people like do you agree with that
[35:39] and I you know this was over Christmas I
[35:40] was having a chat with a family friend
[35:41] and he has his own business and stuff um
[35:44] and he said it was a very tough year
[35:45] every I think 2023 or 2022 23 was very
[35:49] tough for everyone it was it was very
[35:50] very a difficult time of of uh you know
[35:53] most Industries um but he said flat out
[35:55] that inflation is out of control it is
[35:57] not the number that's being reported
[35:59] right and I think it was um Lyn Alden
[36:02] who who was talking about how they
[36:04] measure inflation is um you know if they
[36:07] this year they take a prime rib and they
[36:09] measure the you know they they Mark the
[36:11] cost or the price um next year they come
[36:14] across the same prime rib and that price
[36:16] is increased they'll take they'll
[36:18] replace that prime rib with something
[36:20] else that puts inflation in line with
[36:23] expectation that's
[36:25] misrepresentation that's bullsh right
[36:27] yeah it's it's it's like first of all I
[36:30] think as Michael saor said it in the
[36:32] beginning so often and so so good
[36:34] inflation is always an individual metric
[36:36] because I buy something different than
[36:38] you buy something because inflation is
[36:40] basically the things I buy how much do
[36:44] they go up in price like that's like the
[36:46] most basic and simple explanation of
[36:48] that so uh but if you have a basket good
[36:51] of things it should be comparable like
[36:54] the I mean not May like year or year for
[36:58] sure like if they change it once in like
[37:01] two decades I I can understand that but
[37:04] they are changing it all over the place
[37:07] and this is not uh um reflecting reality
[37:12] I think yeah but but even I mean you say
[37:14] that it might be acceptable in a year or
[37:16] two years why would it even why should
[37:18] it be acceptable inflation is a fat
[37:22] byproduct okay there was no such thing
[37:23] as inflation before um um you know Fiat
[37:27] was introduced where they they decoupled
[37:28] from the gold stand there was no such
[37:30] thing it was it was a sound economy
[37:32] there was very low unemployment it was a
[37:34] sound economy things were working right
[37:37] um 1% is theft even 0.5% inflation is
[37:43] theft I fully agree with you that
[37:47] inflation in general is theft like even
[37:49] 0.1% is is bad inflation we should have
[37:52] deflation because we progressing as a
[37:54] society so everything else as deflation
[37:58] would be step backward and we are
[38:00] stepping backward in a kind of I
[38:03] said if if we uh changing the way we are
[38:08] measuring
[38:09] inflation every one or two decades that
[38:12] would be understandable for me because
[38:16] we are not even having massive inflation
[38:18] we are also changing the metric all the
[38:20] time so everybody's confused and
[38:22] everybody's talking so much about
[38:23] inflation because it's it's it's it's on
[38:26] the top of the minds of everybody yeah
[38:29] well I mean and it was now Christmas it
[38:31] was it was you know the season right and
[38:33] and I don't know about you but I I felt
[38:35] it like I really do I i' I've stopped
[38:38] certain behavior um or or you know um
[38:41] certain things that I would have
[38:43] historically liked to have done I go out
[38:45] less you know I've been a lot more
[38:47] prudent in my grocery shopping um
[38:49] instead of you know taking a premium
[38:51] brand maybe I'll take a a mid-range or
[38:53] you know an entry level or like a a um
[38:56] uh a grocery label you know I've made
[38:59] these CH changes in my life and this
[39:02] it's you know it's not something I would
[39:04] like it's not how I would like to live
[39:05] life I don't want to be like this I
[39:07] don't want to be that you know prudent
[39:08] and like that stuff I do want to have a
[39:10] little bit of of excess and stuff but
[39:12] it's it's hitting everyone in in hard in
[39:14] hard and and uncomfortable ways um and
[39:17] it's it's it's obviously it's
[39:18] marginalizing a um a wealth Gap that's
[39:21] that's making it even worse right and I
[39:23] think it was obviously expedited with Co
[39:25] and and the pandemics but it's it's
[39:28] really that wealth Gap is getting much
[39:30] more severe so just to to to come back
[39:33] to the ETF for one second before we I
[39:36] want to just talk and answer your
[39:37] question on how much time we have left
[39:39] on the whole you know when when when
[39:41] will F potentially pop but um the ETF
[39:45] for me is a
[39:46] vehicle to facilitate the transfer of
[39:50] wealth from the older generations to a
[39:53] newer younger
[39:55] generation okay so if it wasn't for an
[39:59] ETF all that Boomer
[40:01] money would sit and historically be
[40:05] eroded Even If you inherited money it
[40:07] would be eroded through inflation right
[40:09] or or um you know eventual lot of power
[40:13] and stuff or uh um purchasing power but
[40:17] this now provides us with an ideal
[40:19] opportunity a quick expedited vehicle to
[40:22] transfer this wealth from the older
[40:25] haves to the younger Have
[40:28] Nots now I'm I'm technically in the
[40:31] millennial bracket of demograph um and
[40:35] I'm not alone when I say you know I
[40:37] don't own a house it's too bloody
[40:40] expensive to have kids um you know pets
[40:43] are a better option that's why you know
[40:45] I've got a cat in the background it is
[40:47] and I'm not alone in this like you know
[40:49] where I look at my sister she's slightly
[40:51] older than me she's got a house she's
[40:53] got that she's got all those other
[40:55] things she just got in at the right time
[40:57] and it was never like it was always too
[40:59] expensive for me and I do feel left
[41:02] behind you know I feel like I do feel
[41:04] marginalized and I do feel like the
[41:06] system wasn't designed for me and I I
[41:08] don't understand why right but this now
[41:11] gives us an opportunity to say great
[41:14] bring your money in get exposure and let
[41:17] us the younger Generations have um you
[41:21] know accept that that wealth transfer so
[41:24] I think this is a good good thing in in
[41:27] that you know broader sense um I'm not
[41:29] going to go down the whole like pastal
[41:31] oh it's not real Bitcoin and all that
[41:32] kind stuff because the the ETF providers
[41:35] they have to own Bitcoin right and it's
[41:37] on the blockchain and all that kind of
[41:38] stuff so they do have to buy these you
[41:40] know the coins they're not going to
[41:42] misrepresent themselves it is also where
[41:44] regulation could come in to you know
[41:47] Safeguard these issues um I definitely
[41:49] don't think we're going to be facing
[41:50] another FTX issue like it is not it's
[41:53] not even the same ballpark and I also
[41:56] think those lessons have been learned in
[41:57] the past um this is why there's been so
[42:00] many Hoops that we've had to jump
[42:02] through to get or eventually hopefully
[42:04] like we're talking like it's happened
[42:06] but to get approval from the SEC we've
[42:08] had to go through all these these en
[42:10] enormously important um you know uh stop
[42:13] measures to make sure that everything is
[42:15] absolutely straightforward and crystal
[42:17] clear and managed properly so I think
[42:20] it's a good thing because it's going to
[42:21] transfer all that wealth but let's go
[42:22] back to your your question in terms of
[42:24] how much time we have left ultimately if
[42:26] you look at the 20 uh you know 20 years
[42:28] 90% loss of value purchasing power how
[42:31] much more time do we have it comes down
[42:34] to a number of factors this year how
[42:35] much money is going to be printed that
[42:37] is going to be a big big question mark
[42:39] right um America can no longer
[42:44] support war in foreign
[42:48] territory but they will have to support
[42:52] war in foreign territory because it's
[42:53] the only thing currently backing the US
[42:55] do is the military
[42:57] force regardless of of of what America
[43:00] is like if you look at it purely from
[43:02] what is backing the US dollar it is the
[43:05] military control that they have the
[43:07] second they stop doing
[43:09] that this the that's when they start
[43:12] shifting well we won't trade in the USD
[43:16] or we won't use this as an international
[43:17] means of trade right look at The Brick
[43:19] Nations um The Brick Nations are already
[43:22] in deep discussion Saudi Arabia is now
[43:24] joining The Brick Nations in deep
[43:26] discussions to uh to uh facilitate
[43:29] transaction with the the one right which
[43:32] is a very significant thing because now
[43:36] the race to the end has
[43:39] started so when will it happen I'm I'm
[43:44] not going to be able to give you a
[43:45] timeline but I can tell you that it's on
[43:47] the New Horizon and when it happens it's
[43:50] going to be quick and it's going to be
[43:54] incredibly surprising
[43:57] it's going to be a
[43:58] pop and those who are left wanting
[44:01] holding a bag full of paper f are going
[44:05] to be in a very very difficult
[44:08] situation so My Philosophy why why I
[44:12] mean like yeah okay so I'm I'm a single
[44:14] guy I don't have kids but I do have a
[44:15] niece and nephew
[44:17] um my calling in life is obviously to
[44:22] make the world a better place but also
[44:23] for me to establish some sort of
[44:25] generation wealth where they won't have
[44:27] to worry about these things they're
[44:29] going to have access to that at some
[44:31] point and um like we said it's it's
[44:34] highly durable so you know there's no
[44:36] time SP span on this but it's going to
[44:38] happen we know that it's going to happen
[44:39] and I do believe that I'm kind of the
[44:42] maybe I'm my family's life R you know um
[44:45] I can't expect my parents to go out and
[44:47] buy because they're retired they don't
[44:49] have that means um I've you know I do
[44:53] see myself as that life Loft and more
[44:55] than happy to be that um because I've
[44:57] got the the ability to do so but it is
[45:01] just a matter of it's not a matter of if
[45:02] it's definitely a matter of when and I
[45:05] think that we all we are all grossly
[45:07] underestimating how long this is going
[45:09] to take for it to happen and when it
[45:11] happens it's going to be a violent
[45:12] violent
[45:13] pop I agree it will be it will be brutal
[45:18] uh because there's so much depending on
[45:20] that feat system there's so many
[45:21] implications that go off of that event
[45:24] so it will be definitely brutal um I one
[45:28] one of the implications would be a bank
[45:30] run right so people are going to fear
[45:31] that their currency has lost all value
[45:33] and then suddenly everyone's going to go
[45:35] and run to the bank and say I want my
[45:36] cash and the bank is going to say sorry
[45:38] I don't have your cash what do you mean
[45:40] I don't have my cash no well you know
[45:41] it's technically not with us and it's
[45:44] that that's what what scares the
[45:46] out of me yeah right that's what's scary
[45:49] and we already already see that in some
[45:51] countries where there are bankr where
[45:53] there are the infl like Lebanon where
[45:56] value just drops in half overnight where
[46:00] complete life savings get completely
[46:03] wiped out with like literally a click of
[46:06] a button uh so we have already that kind
[46:11] of look in the future with the small
[46:13] window with some countries and people
[46:15] think oh no we in the west like America
[46:18] Europe like this not will not come to us
[46:20] but it will but it it recently happened
[46:23] now with the the Silicon Bank you know
[46:26] it happened in the last what when that
[46:29] happened eight months ago or something
[46:30] or maybe even you know more recent than
[46:32] that it literally happened in America
[46:35] there was a bank run and these Banks
[46:37] could not uh and I even my bank that I
[46:40] was using at the time I'm not going to
[46:42] name the name but I was using a bank in
[46:43] Europe they were backed by that bank in
[46:45] America so this is not going to be an
[46:47] isolate case right so when it happens
[46:49] you're going to see a massive cascading
[46:52] runoff effect and it's going to create
[46:54] massive uh you know panic and it's going
[46:56] to create a um just a complete reaction
[46:59] in the market and I don't know about you
[47:01] but uh I'm not going to say I'm going to
[47:03] sleep tight and sleep comfortable
[47:05] thinking you know uh Bitcoin is going to
[47:06] you know be the answer and saves us
[47:08] because we don't operate in in isolation
[47:11] and for number of reasons we don't have
[47:12] the means or the infrastructural means
[47:14] to use Bitcoin on a day-to-day uh even
[47:16] if it's layer to we don't have that the
[47:18] average shop out there doesn't have a
[47:20] you know lightning wallet integrated the
[47:23] average person or or or business owner
[47:25] doesn't quite understand how to put it
[47:27] onto their books and what are the
[47:28] accounting practices behind it we still
[47:30] so there was a tweet that I had uh a
[47:32] long time ago um but it still remains
[47:35] relevant there's two important timelines
[47:37] right the one is the infrastructural
[47:40] roll outs of using it as a means of
[47:44] easier transaction at a mass scale and
[47:48] the roll out to control and force it
[47:52] down or or regulate it down those are
[47:55] the two most important important
[47:55] timelines that we're looking at I think
[47:57] in my opinion so one needs to be one how
[48:00] can we use it as a means of of a
[48:02] day-to-day exchange um if you hear my
[48:04] accent I'm originally from South Africa
[48:06] and we have one of the biggest retailers
[48:08] in the country called Pick and Pay and
[48:09] they introduced the lightning Network
[48:11] where you can go into pick and Bas and
[48:12] you can actually use and you can uh you
[48:14] can buy your groceries with Bitcoin
[48:16] which is awesome it's one of the it's
[48:18] one of the biggest retailers in the
[48:20] country um you you they're servicing
[48:22] millions of people Bitcoin is a hugely
[48:25] popular
[48:26] um um topic of interest in South Africa
[48:29] because the currency is also running to
[48:31] rubbish right um but that's a real world
[48:35] example of a massive retail and Pick and
[48:37] Pay is it's it's it is large uh it's
[48:40] probably the second or the third largest
[48:42] retailer in in the country uh servicing
[48:44] 45 million people and they've introduced
[48:47] the lightning network to use it as as
[48:49] you know as means of the exchange you
[48:50] can buy your groceries with it that's an
[48:52] incredibly important movement that's
[48:54] that's happened um but again the
[48:56] government there will will will make it
[48:59] as difficult as possible because it is
[49:04] an opt out of the currency uh you know
[49:06] uh system um and yeah it's interesting
[49:10] but yeah it's it definitely for me it's
[49:12] a we're at the right time in space um
[49:16] you know in terms of timelines I think
[49:17] we're at the The Cutting Edge of of
[49:20] where this is going to head and the more
[49:22] discussions we have like this the more
[49:23] people we we talk to and um you know
[49:26] orange pill like you know you said a
[49:28] thousand people orange pill and I I'm
[49:30] I'm I'm doing it like I am I'm I'm
[49:32] making progress I managed to um orange
[49:35] pill a very close family friend who's
[49:37] he's in his 50s and I uh I've walked him
[49:40] through the whole process I gave him all
[49:42] the due diligence and I said you know
[49:44] this is it can go either way right it
[49:46] can go up it can go down you are aware
[49:49] 100% aware of the Financial Risk that
[49:51] you are embarking on he was like
[49:52] absolutely not a problem show me how to
[49:54] do this so I showed him where to get it
[49:56] I even got uh we got him a treasure
[49:59] wallet and and he's now he's like okay
[50:02] so I'm using my example it was a too
[50:03] late to learn he's in his 50s he got the
[50:06] process I explained step by step held
[50:08] you know held him through the way held
[50:10] his hand through the way anytime he had
[50:12] a question I was there available to
[50:14] answer it don't worry about this do it
[50:16] this make sure that you send a little
[50:17] bit of amount you know make sure that
[50:18] you double checking your your your your
[50:20] address um and then he got the the cold
[50:22] wallet and he sent he sent it off and
[50:24] he's now he's got it in cold storage and
[50:26] I think amazing if I can do that to one
[50:29] person you know we all need to be doing
[50:32] that to a couple people and he's in his
[50:34] 50s so like you know he was he's he's
[50:36] I'm not saying that's old or anything
[50:38] I'm just saying you know no he's in his
[50:40] 60s now so 50 60s um if I can do that to
[50:43] to an older generation it's never too
[50:45] late to learn and it's our
[50:47] responsibility who are early adopters uh
[50:50] who are in the educational space to
[50:52] break down the complexities you know map
[50:55] it all out what are the risks what are
[50:56] the rewards um and just be there to help
[50:59] all these people kind of get onto your
[51:00] life your life roong that's our job you
[51:03] know I would I would do this 247 if I
[51:05] could I would literally do this 247 I'd
[51:08] just be talking about Bitcoin salvation
[51:10] economic principles of of um you know
[51:12] freedom and prosperity what a market
[51:15] dynamics you know um what's what's the
[51:17] history that we we we're facing and what
[51:20] when was when was a good what what a
[51:22] good sound economic principles like you
[51:24] know Austrian you know you would know
[51:26] more about the Austrian economics than
[51:28] uh than than I would but
[51:31] um it's a fascinating journey and it's a
[51:34] fascinating opportunity that we have you
[51:35] and I to educate and make sure that
[51:38] everyone around us our immediate loved
[51:39] ones are aware of what's going on um and
[51:42] it's our responsibility to help them I
[51:45] believe that definitely I think a
[51:48] economics is fun because I was in
[51:50] Austria and like I lived a few years in
[51:54] in Germany but basically my whole life I
[51:56] was in In Living in Austria and first I
[52:00] heard about Bitcoin and then I heard
[52:02] cyer Mo and Michael Zen all those big
[52:05] guys talking about Austrian economics
[52:07] and my first thought was like what's so
[52:10] special about Austrian economics because
[52:12] living in Austria and I was like it's
[52:14] the same like in Germany it's like the
[52:16] same in in Swiss basically like okay
[52:18] Swiss is different but uh and then I
[52:20] learned about AUST economics about haek
[52:22] about uh all the all the philosopher
[52:25] there and it's it's a crazy journey to
[52:28] to to go go go there
[52:32] um to end the podcast we having an end
[52:35] routine where the the previous guest
[52:38] asked a question for the the next guest
[52:41] oh wow and it's always like fun I I feel
[52:44] like we are doing the podcast now for
[52:45] five minutes but we are already over
[52:47] over 50 uh
[52:49] so yeah enjoy I enjoy the chat but I
[52:51] mean like um this is sometimes we have
[52:53] to keep ourselves in check because we
[52:54] can talk forever about it you yes and
[52:56] it's it's it's a beautiful topic I love
[52:59] it I try to keep it around one hour uh
[53:02] because I think if they see the podcast
[53:05] going like 150 or two hours uh they they
[53:10] might not click on it because it might
[53:12] be too long I will I will try to keep it
[53:14] at one hour at the end the the question
[53:17] from the previous guest for you uh I
[53:20] mean the previous guest ask the question
[53:23] for the next guest but he does not know
[53:25] who's the next guest is and the question
[53:27] is they say you can change Bitcoin
[53:30] Bitcoin changes you as Bitcoin
[53:32] transforms more and more Minds going
[53:34] forward how do you see societies differ
[53:37] from now in the decades to come it's a
[53:40] good question but it also depends on how
[53:42] successful we are right I think like I
[53:45] said I think we're at a Crossroads a
[53:47] very important Crossroads I think that
[53:49] if we go down this whole
[53:51] dystopic uh cbdc route and those
[53:55] politicians get their way I don't think
[53:57] that we're looking at a very happy
[53:58] future I think we're looking at a very
[54:00] Sinister uh agenda controlled uh
[54:03] militant uh fascist
[54:06] World um however if we do win and
[54:10] Bitcoin does become the prevalent form
[54:13] of a central Reserve
[54:15] currency and people are able to express
[54:19] themselves in terms of freedom and uh
[54:23] value creation and prosperity
[54:26] and inflation is under control and um
[54:31] employment is in check because you have
[54:33] a hard asset you know obviously event
[54:36] inevitably infinitely going up I think
[54:38] that we'll be able to spend our time
[54:40] doing things that we way more enjoy I
[54:43] think we'll be able to Outsource a lot
[54:44] of the mundane to Ai and the rest of the
[54:46] stuff and I think we'll be able to
[54:48] express ourselves much more easily in a
[54:50] in a creative sense um educational sense
[54:52] I think a lot of people are going to go
[54:53] down an educational bar
[54:55] of um you know exploration and
[54:58] self-discovery um but it all depends on
[55:00] the
[55:01] next year to two
[55:04] years and I'm playing my part I'm
[55:08] playing my role in terms of education
[55:10] and making sure that we win um but iFit
[55:13] if Bitcoin wins no when Bitcoin wins
[55:15] because that's we need to be confident
[55:17] that that is the you know the battle
[55:19] will be one I think that we're looking
[55:21] at a
[55:22] beautifully uh
[55:24] balanced
[55:25] Fair diplomatic and inclusive future for
[55:30] everyone because Bitcoin keeps the
[55:33] central organizations the central
[55:34] entities in
[55:36] check so we can then start to
[55:40] collectively decide what the outcome the
[55:42] best outcome for a Col Collective
[55:44] purpose might
[55:46] be so when that happens we will have
[55:51] corruption under control or have a
[55:54] abolished corruption in its entirety and
[55:57] I think that all evil stems from that
[55:59] all evil really stems from greed and and
[56:02] fear and Corruption right all all all of
[56:04] it does I think we're going to be facing
[56:08] a a very um peaceful with war will also
[56:13] be something of the past because we
[56:15] won't need War anymore war is an agenda
[56:18] that has been fueled by a bunch of uh
[56:20] you know fat cat politicians that are
[56:22] playing a game of chess and we are all
[56:24] the C in the middle you know we are all
[56:27] we have to go fight a war that we don't
[56:28] know the cause of it or is it the truth
[56:31] it's manipulation of information right
[56:33] that Bitcoin changes the narrative
[56:35] completely Bitcoin checks it all and
[56:38] makes sure that everyone um is kept
[56:42] under um you know obviously a quality
[56:45] assurance um and a central agenda is
[56:49] kept in check because the the the
[56:52] decentralized mass agenda is taken into
[56:55] consideration has has more of a consens
[56:58] you know consens of uh view on on the
[57:00] outcome so when Bitcoin wins and we all
[57:03] play our part in it um I think that we
[57:05] are looking at a very prosperous future
[57:07] for everyone and it's going to be uh
[57:11] it's going to be great uh you know I'm
[57:13] I'm fairly positive about what what that
[57:15] happens but there we haven't won it yet
[57:16] there are a number of obstacles that we
[57:18] need to go through first um we need to
[57:21] get this complete warmongering under
[57:23] control it's just getting it's getting
[57:25] out of sync with with normality and
[57:28] Logics um but yeah I mean I hope you
[57:32] answered your question there to to a
[57:33] degree but I do think you know we're
[57:35] looking at a very positive future if
[57:37] when Bitcoin wins it's a it's a
[57:39] beautiful answer and a beautiful way to
[57:42] end the podcast um where can people find
[57:45] you best to get in contact with you ask
[57:46] your questions uh get your
[57:48] feedback yeah um look I mean Twitter is
[57:51] always a weird one because you know DMS

[57:57] to to uh connect with me on LinkedIn I'm
[57:59] fairly uh I do a lot of educational
[58:01] posts on LinkedIn longer posts on
[58:02] LinkedIn um unfortunately the LinkedIn
[58:05] algorithm doesn't always work in your
[58:06] favor because of uh maybe they don't
[58:10] they don't like the Bitcoin algor um
[58:12] Bitcoin content on there uh because it's
[58:14] more of a Sinister background but um
[58:17] more than happy to connect with me on
[58:18] LinkedIn follow me on on Twitter or X um
