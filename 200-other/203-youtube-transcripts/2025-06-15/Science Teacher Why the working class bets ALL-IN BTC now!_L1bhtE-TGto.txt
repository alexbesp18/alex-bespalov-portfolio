[00:00] everything's a Fiat system unless it's
[00:01] Bitcoin right when I bought it I had
[00:03] this weird intuitive feeling that I own
[00:05] something really special bitcoin's the
[00:07] opposite of debt slavery it will be way
[00:09] sooner than we think because those
[00:11] wheels that are right now in motion are
[00:13] Wheeling very very quickly I put both
[00:16] those pieces of land up for sale all
[00:18] glory to God they sold I liquidated all
[00:20] of my real estate I emptied my savings
[00:22] account I sold any stocks I closed out
[00:25] my IRA and I took all that money and I
[00:27] just bought as much Bitcoin as I could
[00:29] with it spent hundreds and thousands of
[00:31] years in that abundant mindset helping
[00:33] one another Bitcoin I believe will
[00:35] return us to that Bitcoin gives them
[00:37] that it gives them a reason to be a
[00:39] scientist it gives them a reason to get
[00:40] into Tech into engineering into
[00:42] mathematics we want everyone to get on
[00:44] the Bitcoin standard and be involved in
[00:46] Bitcoin in any way shape or form they
[00:48] can yes we could have no longer any
[00:50] Central Authority if we're under a
[00:52] Bitcoin
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] standard why did you get into Bitcoin
[00:59] and what Pro did you see in the world
[01:01] that brought you to
[01:03] bitcoin absolutely Robin so this is a I
[01:06] can answer both those right off the bat
[01:07] for me so personally a big problem and
[01:11] I'm from the United States is the debt
[01:13] crisis and a lot of the debt crisis that
[01:15] all of us are in individually and I got
[01:18] into Bitcoin actually towards the end of
[01:22] 2023 and the reason I got into it is I
[01:25] have been an investor my whole life in
[01:27] the sense of just being on an exchange
[01:30] and buying stocks trying to S you know
[01:32] Buy Low sell high and I found myself in
[01:35] a situation at the end of 2023 I'm a
[01:38] husband and a father a school teacher uh
[01:41] so therefore I'm in a lot of debt in
[01:44] order to have a home to be able to raise
[01:46] my family in I have to have a very high
[01:47] Mortgage in order to do what I love
[01:50] which is teach I had to get a very high
[01:52] education which was a high cost so like
[01:55] most Americans just to have what we need
[01:59] and most of us we need a home if we want
[02:01] to have a family and we need an
[02:02] education if we want to do a job we love
[02:05] the situation we're in is that that puts
[02:07] us in a large amount of debt and what
[02:11] that does is it really it the word it's
[02:15] it's a very serious word but I'm going
[02:16] to use it as as a debt slave that's my
[02:18] problem is is truly it's debt slavery so
[02:21] at the end of 2023 Christmas was coming
[02:24] up and this is a little bit of actually
[02:26] an emotional story and my where my love
[02:28] for Bitcoin just skyrocketed because and
[02:31] it'll give you an idea of a little bit
[02:33] of just who I am and my personal beliefs
[02:35] I needed some money for Christmas
[02:37] because I wanted to get my kids some
[02:39] Christmas presents and I wanted to get
[02:40] my wife something and I had no money I
[02:43] had no money I had some I I always have
[02:45] I've always been a saver so I've always
[02:47] had money in a savings account and I was
[02:50] just in a position in life where I
[02:51] needed to I needed a miracle and you
[02:55] know I I prayed I said God just please
[02:57] direct me to I need some access to money
[03:00] and it was so strange because I get this
[03:03] idea to buy some Bitcoin and this was at
[03:06] the end of 2023 when it was still kind
[03:09] of in its lower value as it was on its
[03:11] way up but not that big jump and I had
[03:14] no idea what Bitcoin was I just kind of
[03:16] knew it was around I'd heard of it um I
[03:19] was never negative for it I always
[03:21] thought it was really cool just what was
[03:22] going on with it but I was inspired to
[03:24] buy some and so I bought some just
[03:28] before the end of 2023 that like Wing in
[03:30] a prayer that it would looking at it
[03:32] purely from an investor standpoint like
[03:34] I just need this to go up 25% so I could
[03:36] have some Christmas money for my family
[03:39] and then sure enough you know I bought
[03:40] it just at that cusp right before it
[03:43] like just happened to explode and and
[03:45] right before Christmas so I pulled it
[03:48] off it was a good investor move at first
[03:50] but I was so impressed so I did what I
[03:52] do in investing which was just sell off
[03:54] some profit but I held on to the
[03:56] original Bitcoin because I had this
[03:58] interesting feeling
[04:00] that there was something more to it than
[04:02] just it being an investment because
[04:05] right when I bought it I had this weird
[04:07] intuitive feeling that I owned something
[04:09] really special like right when I pushed
[04:12] the button and bought the Bitcoin
[04:14] something just hit me that for the first
[04:15] time it wasn't like just buying a stock
[04:17] that I had no relationship to like
[04:19] seeing that I actually had some Bitcoin
[04:21] I like felt something like powerful I
[04:24] felt empowered and then sure enough you
[04:26] know the prayer came through and I was
[04:28] able to give my family a Christmas
[04:30] and that was just that small problem it
[04:32] solved a problem right away a very quick
[04:35] and it doesn't always doal that I'm not
[04:37] recommending that's how people play
[04:38] Bitcoin because it's volatile it just
[04:40] worked out for me to get me on board so
[04:42] it was kind of a spiritual experience
[04:46] and you know it ended up uh coming into
[04:49] basically this whole idea that well well
[04:52] maybe this can solve a bigger problem of
[04:54] mine which is this
[04:57] overall debt that I have not just taking
[05:00] care of this individual event that I
[05:01] needed money for Christmas but now I
[05:03] started looking can this solve a problem
[05:05] of 10 20 30 years down the road that I'm
[05:09] in getting me out of this fiat currency
[05:12] debt that I'm in that's where I'm at
[05:14] right now Robin what do you got are you
[05:16] looking I I I love it already so much um
[05:21] do are you already looking forward to
[05:23] like maybe do with with with Bitcoin and
[05:25] retirement like are you looking like oh
[05:27] how that's that's how how many Bitcoin I
[05:30] need to accumulate and be dep free uh do
[05:32] you do those calculations like in in 20
[05:34] years I need that amount of Bitcoin I
[05:37] should not have Dept and then I can
[05:39] maybe retire on my
[05:41] stack yes great question so you know
[05:44] what at first I started doing that I was
[05:46] watching a bunch of YouTube channels
[05:47] doing the calculations and then you know
[05:50] what and when it comes to when it comes
[05:53] to anything I am more of like a
[05:55] fundamentalist than I am a technician
[05:57] like I'm still working on understanding
[05:59] Bitcoin technically I'm not a great
[06:01] person to talk about to the technical
[06:04] that Bitcoin is but I love the
[06:05] fundamentals so I was doing all those
[06:07] calculations and then all of a sudden it
[06:09] hit me I just thought you know what if I
[06:11] really believe in this thing and I
[06:13] really believe in the long run of it it
[06:16] I just need to simplify it and I just
[06:18] need to go all in and then just hold it
[06:21] until it solves my problem with the
[06:24] faith that it will indeed solve my
[06:26] problem so what I ended up doing
[06:27] actually was this is Hardcore Robin of
[06:31] how much I I believe in Bitcoin and
[06:33] believe in in the long run I am
[06:35] fortunate enough where I had some
[06:38] inheritance some land from various
[06:41] grandparents unfortunate that I'm like
[06:43] one of the only children in both sides
[06:45] of my family so I had uh some real
[06:47] estate that I owned that I just been
[06:49] holding on to that was really just
[06:50] costing me money in property tax and
[06:53] whatnot so I was actually losing money
[06:54] on it but that was my main store of
[06:56] value that at first I thought I would
[06:58] use for my retirement I'll just hold on
[07:00] to this land 10 20 years from now this
[07:02] land will sell and then I'll be able to
[07:05] pay off all my debt and retire on that
[07:07] as soon as I had this idea of Bitcoin
[07:11] being my new store of value I put both
[07:15] those pieces of land up for sale all
[07:18] glory to God they sold and I took all
[07:21] that money I stopped doing any
[07:22] calculations I stopped doing any of what
[07:24] I need to retire and I just Consolidated
[07:28] all of my money into cash I liquidated
[07:30] all of my real estate I emptied my
[07:33] savings account I sold any stocks I I
[07:35] closed out my IRA and took all my IRA
[07:39] money and there's something about that
[07:41] that's interesting about why I actually
[07:43] like the ETFs and why I think people the
[07:45] ETFs are useful just a small thing on
[07:47] that if we remember but I took all that
[07:49] money and I just bought as much Bitcoin
[07:51] as I could with it and it's fun because
[07:54] you know what I've heard is the first
[07:55] rule about Bitcoin is you know you don't
[07:57] say how much Bitcoin you have so I love
[07:59] that rule but I'll say that based on the
[08:02] calculations that I had done
[08:04] previously I'm matching up with that so
[08:07] now it's just having faith and giving it
[08:10] time and it's been such a a relief for
[08:14] me because one thing that was really
[08:16] stressful was playing the stock market
[08:18] and one thing that was really stressful
[08:20] was keeping an eye on the land values
[08:22] and keeping up with the property tax and
[08:24] now not only is all that stress gone but
[08:27] it's it's been replaced with joy because
[08:30] I just get to sit back and do what I
[08:33] love which is teach and hey my debt is
[08:36] what it is and I just make sure I pay my
[08:38] interest payments on it make sure that
[08:40] it doesn't put me in a position where
[08:42] the authorities are knocking on my door
[08:44] and I'm just letting Bitcoin do its
[08:46] thing it's like my guardian angel out
[08:47] there just I know it'll take care of me
[08:50] and and the stack is is decent and I
[08:53] just want it to do its thing absolutely
[08:55] really cool why did you say that uh ETFs
[08:58] are useful like where is this coming
[09:00] from yes so where here's where I here's
[09:04] where the ETF was useful for me so when
[09:06] if you're someone like me and you go
[09:08] hardcore and you just like liquidate
[09:10] everything and put it all into Bitcoin
[09:12] you're going and you have an IRA you
[09:15] can't pull out the profits on an IRA you
[09:17] can only take out the contributions
[09:19] taxfree so I pulled out all my
[09:21] contributions taxfree but those I The
[09:23] Profit that I had had from the IRA if I
[09:25] were to take it out it gets heavily
[09:28] heavily penalized but thanks to the ETFs
[09:32] what I did was I just put that profit
[09:34] into the Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin
[09:37] ETFs are actually really they're doing
[09:40] really good my Bitcoin ETF that's on my
[09:43] IRA still so I just basically put all my
[09:46] IRA money into the the Bitcoin ETF it's
[09:49] earning a dividend um I kind of get
[09:51] access to a brokerage because these ETFs
[09:53] these guys are like putting all the
[09:55] power of and Technology of a stock
[09:57] market into Bitcoin you know they're
[09:59] working for you and using Bots and
[10:01] trying to buy low and sell high and do
[10:02] all that stressful stuff for you so it's
[10:05] fun because I basically had some money
[10:08] that I didn't have access to to just buy
[10:10] directly with Bitcoin it was trapped in
[10:12] the ira but because of the ETFs I was
[10:15] able to take that and still be involved
[10:17] in Bitcoin through it so I thought that
[10:18] was a really cool opportunity wa the the
[10:21] Bitcoin edfs pay dividends or you mean
[10:24] they they just go up with with that like
[10:25] are you actually paying dividends both
[10:28] both yeah they they go up up with the
[10:30] the Bitcoin depending on which one you
[10:31] pick you know you're just kind of ryant
[10:33] on whatever the Traders are that are
[10:35] dealing with it but uh the one that I I
[10:37] particular and I don't know the symbol
[10:39] off the top of my head right now I
[10:40] should have wrote that down but they
[10:41] paying dividends absolutely so it's just
[10:43] like any other ETF I get a a quarterly
[10:45] dividend from it whether it goes up or
[10:47] down and then it's it's doing really
[10:50] well it's actually performing along with
[10:52] Bitcoin so they're doing a pretty decent
[10:54] job with it and it's money that I
[10:55] wouldn't have been able to do anything
[10:56] with anyways because I couldn't pull it
[10:58] out so it's cool that I even had an
[11:00] outlet for it for Bitcoin what what do
[11:03] you think will will those ETFs do long
[11:05] term for Bitcoin as I think they enable
[11:10] a huge Market they bring a lot of money
[11:12] in that will otherwise not be spent
[11:15] maybe like I think you are a great
[11:17] example because you had a haircut then
[11:19] on on your profits if you actually want
[11:20] to buy Bitcoin with that you probably
[11:22] would have maybe just invested in some
[11:24] other stocks maybe in micro strategy
[11:26] also or something like that uh but uh uh
[11:29] that would be money that otherwise would
[11:31] not be in Bitcoin and you're a bitcoiner
[11:34] and what so enabling outside people that
[11:38] are not bitcoiners but they're also
[11:40] wanting to to invest in something like
[11:42] that they're like hey let's invest in
[11:44] something new and they have like 20
[11:46] million on on their on their net worth
[11:49] and they're like yeah let's put like one
[11:50] million of that in Bitcoin because it's
[11:51] a new Innovative thing you don't really
[11:53] think about that just put it in what
[11:55] what kind of um important do you think
[11:58] is is uh those are those ETFs for
[12:01] Bitcoin yeah great question Robin and
[12:03] again I'm a fundamentalist I'm not a
[12:05] technician so I don't know all the ins
[12:06] and outs of what it can do for Bitcoin
[12:09] technically but fundamentally the
[12:11] greatest thing I see is the
[12:12] advertisement to it the fact that here's
[12:15] the big thing we we want everybody to
[12:17] get on board we want this to spread we
[12:19] want everyone to get on the Bitcoin
[12:21] standard and be involved in Bitcoin in
[12:23] any way shape or form that they can and
[12:26] the ETFs are putting Bitcoin on the
[12:29] World Market on the world investing
[12:31] Market it's given people a chance like
[12:33] me at the end of 2023 a guy that had
[12:36] never even dipped his foot in the water
[12:38] like you just mentioned there's plenty
[12:40] of people out there that are investors
[12:43] that are now starting to sniff around
[12:45] Bitcoin through the ETFs and they're
[12:47] going to buy some of those ETFs just
[12:49] like you said with maybe one two three a
[12:52] certain percentage of their portfolio
[12:54] and then they're going to get that
[12:56] intuitive feeling like me because
[12:58] Bitcoin so powerful that as soon as you
[13:00] own some in any way shape or form it
[13:03] Sparks that conversation in your mind
[13:05] and your heart and your soul it's just
[13:07] got that magic to it so what my greatest
[13:10] appreciation for the ETFs is the
[13:12] advertising aspect of it that it's
[13:14] getting the Bitcoin out there to more
[13:16] people that more people are going to
[13:18] start getting involved with it through
[13:19] the ETFs and I think a lot of the people
[13:22] that buy the ETFs or even companies are
[13:24] then going to start buying the Bitcoin
[13:26] directly because they're going to
[13:27] realize well why don't I just go and
[13:29] actually get myself some Bitcoin and
[13:32] probably keep their ETFs so I think the
[13:34] great it's a great I think it's a great
[13:35] thing for Bitcoin fundamentally not
[13:38] understanding the full technical behind
[13:39] it but that it's just going to get more
[13:41] and more people involved in it it's a
[13:44] it's a great catalyze for for Bitcoin
[13:46] that's for sure and you mentioned
[13:47] something before that I was really
[13:49] intrigued uh with Bitcoin being the
[13:52] opposite of the feat slavery and I think
[13:55] uh I want to come back to that just for
[13:57] a moment because I think a lot of people
[14:00] don't see it that way that Fe is slavery
[14:04] and I feel very strongly that feat is
[14:06] actually slavery um walk us through like
[14:09] why do you think that this fear and this
[14:12] st-based system is slavery especially as
[14:14] someone who also has stepped and
[14:17] experienced that with the student uh
[14:19] loan and everything like that so you you
[14:21] lived through as a slave to that Fiat
[14:24] system and you found Bitcoin I like that
[14:26] that's a really interesting Avenue
[14:29] yeah absolutely Robin and you're you're
[14:31] 100% right I'm currently I'm very
[14:34] grateful for my life I'm a very rich man
[14:36] in the sense that I have lots of love I
[14:38] have all the things that you need to be
[14:40] a good human being and have great I am a
[14:42] financial da debt slave I don't because
[14:45] that that's such a powerful word so I
[14:47] have my rights and I have my freedoms
[14:48] and my Liberties but financially I am
[14:51] indeed a debt slave so here's the
[14:53] contrast between the Fiat system is it
[14:57] it's an inevitable debt slave system and
[15:00] a lot of this is because of the reason
[15:02] whether you want to call it uh
[15:04] debasement or because you or you can
[15:06] call it inflation based on the printing
[15:09] of money which has just been in a way
[15:11] beaten to death but really the key word
[15:13] here and the reason why Fiat is a debt
[15:16] slave system is because it inevitably
[15:19] has to charge interest that's and I
[15:22] thought a lot about this and the reason
[15:24] why uh Fiat inevitably leads into a debt
[15:27] slave system and this is like you have
[15:29] to almost go biblical with this because
[15:31] there's constant stories in the Bible
[15:34] and they're off a Fiat system whether
[15:36] it's everything's a Fiat system unless
[15:38] it's Bitcoin at this point because if
[15:39] you're dealing with Metals you
[15:41] eventually get debasement they start
[15:43] taking the good stuff out of the metal
[15:44] and putting the bad stuff in so it loses
[15:46] value if you switch over to paper you
[15:48] start printing more of it so it gets
[15:49] devalued so anytime you're dealing with
[15:51] money it gets devalued when you lend it
[15:56] if I L if you lend me $100,000 Robin
[15:59] anything besides Bitcoin even if you're
[16:01] a moral or ethical person because of the
[16:04] time that it's going to take me to pay
[16:06] you back even if you don't want to
[16:08] charge me interest you have to you have
[16:11] to because that money is going to be
[16:13] worth less by the time I give it back to
[16:15] you just by the nature of debasement and
[16:19] printing money and I don't personally
[16:22] take a stance I don't like to judge
[16:23] people so you know you have to print
[16:26] money if that's what you're dealing with
[16:27] you have to debase coin coins as
[16:29] economies grow because you need more
[16:32] money to supply the economy and we were
[16:34] talking a little bit about Ray doio
[16:36] before and and we could touch back on
[16:38] him and I highly recommend the book
[16:39] changing world order I only understood
[16:42] about 25% of it but it helps you
[16:44] understand the nature of money as he
[16:46] puts it and he basically what I got from
[16:49] it in summary was any type of money
[16:53] eventually gets debased or printed
[16:56] because it has to because you need more
[16:58] of it to drive the economy and therefore
[17:00] the value drops and then that value
[17:02] dropping is replaced with interest so
[17:05] we're in a situation now and this
[17:07] situation is biblical because there was
[17:10] stories in the Bible many of them where
[17:13] they're covering the Israelites they're
[17:15] using metal and they had a system where
[17:18] every 50 years they would actually just
[17:20] do what they call Jubilee they would
[17:22] just wipe out all debts because it
[17:24] happen so often using metal as a
[17:27] currency put every body into debt
[17:29] slavery every 50 years it was like
[17:31] they'd start it and they'd notice that
[17:33] everybody would drop into debt slavery
[17:35] by the end of 50 years and just
[17:36] instinctively they would wipe out all
[17:38] the debt every 50 years that's how
[17:40] reliable it is that fiat currency leads
[17:43] you into debt slavery just through the
[17:45] nature of the Beast right and the whole
[17:47] again the whole reason of that is
[17:49] because it gets devalued so you lend me
[17:51] money you have to charge me interest in
[17:53] order for you to just even make your
[17:55] money back when I give it back what that
[17:57] ends up doing to me is while I have the
[17:59] money it's also getting devalued and
[18:00] then I owe you more back of the money
[18:03] that's been devalued so I'm worse off
[18:06] and you're really just getting your
[18:07] money back and at the end of the day
[18:08] we've now created debt that's how all
[18:11] the Fiat systems are always going to
[18:12] work that's how anything besides Bitcoin
[18:15] is going to work now alternatively when
[18:18] you switch over to bitcoin Bitcoin is
[18:21] the complete opposite and this is so
[18:23] beautiful and this is the only technical
[18:25] thing I really am slightly confident on
[18:28] with Bitcoin is the reason why bitcoin's
[18:32] the opposite of debt slavery is because
[18:34] the scarcity the 21 million scarcity you
[18:38] could print more Fiat you could debase
[18:40] metals and make more metal coins you
[18:42] can't make more Bitcoin the 21 million
[18:45] and the key there is and this blew my
[18:48] mind and this is actually when I
[18:50] understood this this is what helped me
[18:51] liquidate everything I had and put it
[18:53] into Bitcoin because I had it in the
[18:55] back of my head I thought well like it's
[18:57] 21 million what's going to stop anybody
[18:59] from doing 21 million in one why can't
[19:02] can't they just make more like is this
[19:04] Integrity where where's the integrity
[19:07] and then I realized that Bitcoin the
[19:10] protocol is protected by proof of work
[19:13] the scarcity is protected by proof of
[19:15] work and then the proof of work is
[19:17] protected by the miners the power of the
[19:20] miners that's it that's everything
[19:22] there's this enormous hashing firewall
[19:26] that is making it to where and this is a
[19:28] big big thing because I had to overcome
[19:30] so many things Robin and I'm going all
[19:32] over the place with this but I do know
[19:33] the original question we're talking
[19:35] about the debt slavery between Fiat and
[19:38] Bitcoin but it's important to understand
[19:40] why Bitcoin scarcity is protected to
[19:42] understand why it's the opposite of Deb
[19:44] slavery Fiat because you have it relies
[19:47] everything on the fact that only 21
[19:49] million that's everything that's
[19:51] everything to the reason why it's not
[19:54] and the reason we can trust that is
[19:56] because the miners putting all all that
[19:59] power in all that hashing power
[20:01] protecting that
[20:02] protocol and that is why anyone that is
[20:05] worried about the power consumption that
[20:08] Bitcoin is doing that's the reason you
[20:10] should love it that's the reason you
[20:12] should love it because that's what's
[20:13] protecting the Integrity of the scarcity
[20:16] so now that we have the Integrity of the
[20:17] scarcity 21 million Bitcoin now it's
[20:21] beautiful because it's the complete
[20:22] opposite of Fiat and uh anything metal
[20:26] because now the value goes up now you're
[20:28] not dealing with debasement or inflation
[20:31] through printing now because you can't
[20:33] make anymore the value continues to go
[20:36] up on a long enough timeline so this
[20:38] actually makes L this solves the crisis
[20:41] of lending it's beautiful Bitcoin is the
[20:44] answer to everything I have to say this
[20:46] at one point Ecclesiastes he was this
[20:48] existential King in uh in the Old
[20:52] Testament he was he did everything under
[20:55] the sun to his own words he had one
[20:57] thing to say about money he has the best
[20:59] definition for money it should be the
[21:01] answer to everything that's his standard
[21:04] of money if you're using whatever you're
[21:05] using as money it should be the answer
[21:07] to everything so Bitcoin is the answer
[21:09] to this debt crisis because it solves
[21:11] The Lending crisis because now Robin you
[21:13] lend me a Bitcoin you don't need to
[21:16] charge me Interest anymore because in
[21:18] the time that I have that Bitcoin the
[21:21] value goes up on a long enough timeline
[21:23] there's no way that that Bitcoin becomes
[21:25] less valuable so you don't need to
[21:27] charge me Interest
[21:29] and by the time you get that Bitcoin
[21:30] back as I lend it to you it's either
[21:33] worth more or in the worst case once we
[21:36] all hey it's been around 13 14 years
[21:38] it's only gone up this integrity and
[21:41] belief system in bitcoin's only going to
[21:43] get better as it continues to improve
[21:44] itself IM imagine lending a hundred
[21:47] years from now where Bitcoin has proven
[21:49] itself and it's worth millions and
[21:51] millions of dollars if it's still even
[21:53] valued in Fiat which it probably will be
[21:56] I think it Fiat will still be around
[21:58] it's a great kind of pricing value for
[22:00] Bitcoin but imagine once it has this
[22:02] like Hundred Year history of just only
[22:04] going up in value you're you're going to
[22:06] have no issue lending out your Bitcoin
[22:08] and then getting it back it's a way more
[22:09] ethical and moral society and people
[22:12] won't need to go into debt anymore and
[22:14] they'll be able to lend Bitcoin freely
[22:16] without having to charge interest and
[22:18] one last thing I want to note about that
[22:21] because I I started learning when I
[22:22] learned about the Satoshi so the problem
[22:25] also was why you have to print more fiat
[22:27] currency and metals is because because
[22:28] you just need more of it to spur the
[22:30] economy right and another thought I had
[22:32] was well how can 21 million Bitcoin be
[22:35] enough for everybody and it's because
[22:37] it's not just Bitcoin it's it's Satoshi
[22:40] hundreds and millions of Satoshi
[22:43] quadrillions of satosi so really you've
[22:46] got this quadrillions of Satoshi
[22:48] available that's by far enough for
[22:50] everybody in in our world and then if
[22:53] you need more you just move the decimal
[22:55] point over it can go eight decimal
[22:57] points
[22:59] and this is a thought process that would
[23:00] take like too much of our time but all
[23:02] I'm saying is once you realize that you
[23:03] could just start moving the decimal
[23:05] points over you can just logarithmically
[23:08] have more and more Satoshi available for
[23:10] people without devaluing it it's more
[23:13] money than we could actually possibly
[23:14] dream about it it would take and we'd
[23:17] have to colonize the whole galaxy I
[23:18] think to like max out the potential for
[23:21] Bitcoin to supply a society like it's
[23:24] crazy how much of it is available in
[23:27] reality for us to use and never have to
[23:29] charge interest and none of us ever have
[23:31] to be in debt ever again using
[23:33] Bitcoin that was longwinded and all over
[23:35] the place is really great I I love it a
[23:38] lot I think the uh I don't know why the
[23:41] guests always apologize for renting I
[23:43] think but but the I think the ranting is
[23:45] the the the the the cool stuff about the
[23:48] podcast like when when when we just get
[23:50] into the rambling mode so I love it a
[23:52] lot there was so many things in there um
[23:55] I think as the last point was really
[23:58] important to note because a lot of
[24:00] especially beginners to bitcoin are like
[24:02] oh but then there's only 21 million then
[24:04] like what's when all every everything is
[24:06] sold like yeah when everything is sold
[24:08] the price will be going up into to
[24:11] Infinity basically when nobody wants to
[24:13] sell any Bitcoin uh or spend any Bitcoin
[24:16] then the price will go to Infinity but
[24:18] before it will hit Infinity some
[24:20] bitcoiner will be so freaking rich that
[24:22] he will buy an island will buy a super
[24:25] car and then those sets get released
[24:27] again uh and it doesn't matter how what
[24:30] the amount of Sates is because like if
[24:33] it's 21 million or 100 million or just a
[24:35] million Sates that are are there and
[24:38] it's like quadrillions of satos that are
[24:41] available 21 million Bitcoins so uh that
[24:44] that's that's a really great point that
[24:47] you brought up and we can even the Sates
[24:49] we can make micro Sates we can make
[24:53] under another thing like we we like it's
[24:56] it's software we can do that yes and
[24:59] this uh and it does not affect the
[25:02] overall Supply it just divides one AI
[25:05] into many other things so like that's
[25:08] that's a huge part that especially
[25:09] beginners cannot wrap their head around
[25:11] and I think that's that's a very great
[25:13] point that you that you mentioned uh
[25:16] there thank you Robin it's a massive
[25:19] thought it's a massive thought sorry go
[25:21] ahead sir one thing that I was curious
[25:25] that that you saw uh that you brought up
[25:27] was lending bit coin because I think a
[25:29] lot about the lending Market in Bitcoin
[25:32] especially when you think of um what
[25:36] will bitcoiners do that have a lot of
[25:38] Bitcoin but don't want to spend their
[25:40] Bitcoin they they rather when there's
[25:43] still a feed currency but you rather
[25:45] lend the Bitcoin out get some feed for
[25:47] that and with pay with that feed um some
[25:50] some bills that that's only possible as
[25:53] long as as feed is still around but then
[25:56] there's also the scenario where
[25:59] what happens if there's no longer feared
[26:01] like um what are you are you even able
[26:06] to lend out Bitcoin and what do you get
[26:08] from that in your return because as you
[26:10] said like Bitcoin goes up uh forever or
[26:13] if Bitcoin is a stand that all the
[26:14] prices go down against Bitcoin because
[26:17] then we measure everything in Bitcoin so
[26:19] what would be my incentive to even lend
[26:22] out my Bitcoin uh to give someone else
[26:26] like H how do you think will
[26:29] uh The Lending Market will be affected
[26:32] in the in the medium term when fear is
[26:34] still around and also maybe in the long
[26:36] term when maybe fear is is not around
[26:39] anymore do you have thoughts around
[26:41] that yes oh my God Robin that's such a
[26:44] great question because you just unlocked
[26:46] one thing that I wanted to talk about
[26:47] and I didn't know how I was going to tie
[26:48] it in and I'm going to go for it now
[26:50] because that's that's a really good
[26:52] question and I don't have a technical
[26:53] answer but I have a an anthropolog an
[26:58] anthropological answer and a humanist
[27:00] answer to that so you know Robin's
[27:03] question is is how how would lending
[27:06] work and I think let's just let's just
[27:08] say that we've reached a point where
[27:09] there's only Bitcoin left and we're all
[27:11] dealing on the Bitcoin standard and
[27:13] that's it and so what would be the
[27:15] incentive of Robin lending me some of
[27:18] his Bitcoin or vice versa and here's
[27:20] here's my answer to that and here's what
[27:22] I think that is the great hope with
[27:24] Bitcoin for all of us so I'm going to go
[27:27] back so I'm a biologist by trade and a
[27:30] poor one at that but if you're a
[27:32] biologist you also end up being an
[27:34] anthropologist and one thing that's
[27:36] interesting that I've noticed that
[27:37] everyone is talking a lot everyone wants
[27:39] to like get away from the current
[27:41] Society every I speak from the American
[27:43] perspective because I've just I haven't
[27:45] traveled in a long time so I've really
[27:46] just been in America for a good long
[27:48] while and when you talk to an American
[27:50] most Americans have this dream to just
[27:53] return to the hunter gatherer lifestyle
[27:56] they all want to like move out into the
[27:58] middle of the woods with just their
[28:00] small little Clan and just like live off
[28:02] the land and just be away from what they
[28:05] consider this toxic society which has
[28:08] become incredibly
[28:10] anti-humanist and Incredibly selfish and
[28:13] Incredibly greedy and God knows that I'm
[28:16] a part of that and that I've played into
[28:18] that myself so certainly I need to do a
[28:20] lot of self-reflection on that but
[28:24] specifically what has happened is you
[28:26] know we have a greedy toxic
[28:28] society that is and you nailed it when
[28:31] you said you know why why lend anything
[28:33] what's in it for me so really quick I
[28:36] want to go back to how humans first
[28:39] started interacting with one another and
[28:41] this will tie into answering
[28:43] this barter was never really a big thing
[28:46] barter was never really actually a big
[28:48] thing the first money that was almost
[28:51] perfect it was almost as good as Bitcoin
[28:53] was something called Social Capital that
[28:56] was hum's first money so when humans
[28:59] were became Homo sapiens about 3 400,000
[29:02] years ago we lived the hunter gather
[29:05] life style for a few hundred thousand
[29:08] years and barter was very rarely used
[29:11] because it wasn't efficient it was
[29:14] Social Capital was the form of money
[29:16] that hunter gatherers used and here's
[29:18] how it worked and this is beautiful
[29:21] because this is essentially a lending
[29:24] economy I'm a bow maker Robin's an arrow
[29:27] maker all right our money is social
[29:29] capital now I need some arrows so I go
[29:32] over to Robin I'm like Robin I need some
[29:34] arrows now we're not doing barter
[29:36] because Robin already has a bow so it it
[29:38] wouldn't make sense for him to take a
[29:40] bow that I have at that time because one
[29:43] important thing about the hunter
[29:45] gatherer Community is let's say we have
[29:47] 150 members we need every member doing
[29:51] well we need it because every member and
[29:54] here's their proof of work is food we
[29:57] need every member Gathering food
[29:59] whatever it takes we got to make sure
[30:00] everyone's Gathering food that's our
[30:02] bitcoin's proof of work essentially
[30:04] that's holding our integrity together
[30:07] so Robin's gonna lend me the arrows but
[30:10] not take the bow because he doesn't need
[30:12] it somebody else might need it so he's
[30:14] just going to go ahead and lend me those
[30:15] arrows based on the social capital that
[30:18] when I go and I use those arrows and get
[30:21] a kill I'm going to share the meat with
[30:24] him and that is the idea of the H 100
[30:28] gatherer lending is the fact that he
[30:30] knows he can give me those bows and
[30:31] arrows off of just the fact that though
[30:33] in that moment he's not getting anything
[30:35] from it eventually he's going to get the
[30:37] meat from the arrows I produced and
[30:40] further on down the road if his bow does
[30:42] break and now he comes over to me I'm
[30:44] GNA give him the bow because he gave me
[30:45] the arrows earlier so you just have this
[30:48] perfect lending economy that's seated in
[30:51] Social Capital meaning we all have
[30:53] integrity we trust each other that in
[30:56] the long run by giving me the arrows and
[30:58] helping me do better Robin's going to do
[31:01] better because he's going to see that
[31:02] meat get returned or he's going to get a
[31:04] bow later on and what's even more
[31:06] beautiful about that is the the
[31:08] Integrity that holds Social Capital
[31:10] together is if somebody doesn't honor
[31:11] that and bitcoin's cool an analogy to
[31:14] this because if somebody messes with
[31:15] Bitcoin the whole network knows
[31:17] immediately right it's all tied together
[31:18] through proof of work so you can't
[31:20] manipulate it without getting called out
[31:23] if I take the arrows and I get a kill
[31:25] but I don't share the meat and Robin
[31:27] finds out about that and then he comes
[31:29] and wants to get a vot for me and I
[31:31] don't give it and then now that all the
[31:32] hunter gatherers are saying well what's
[31:34] going on here why aren't you giving him
[31:35] the bow and they find out it's because
[31:37] I'm not sharing it's like the proof of
[31:39] work has been called out I've
[31:40] manipulated the system I get called out
[31:43] by the community and now I have to give
[31:45] Robin the bow and it returns things to
[31:47] the Natural order so this money that was
[31:50] Social Capital was perfect it lasted for
[31:53] hundreds and thousands of years
[31:54] perfectly so well that humans m
[31:58] multiplied to the point where they took
[32:00] over the whole earth and we started
[32:01] having to do agriculture because we
[32:03] needed more calories out of small
[32:05] amounts of land so one where Social
[32:08] Capital failed was it failed to scale it
[32:11] couldn't scale once you started having
[32:13] societies bigger than 150 that proof of
[32:17] work the money and the U I'm sorry the
[32:20] uh the trust and the Integrity between
[32:22] one another you couldn't know everybody
[32:24] in your community past 150 so Social
[32:27] Capital went away and now we didn't need
[32:29] to share food anymore and now this
[32:31] brought in the use of coins seashells
[32:34] things that we could use as a medium of
[32:36] exchange as strangers and then kicked
[32:39] off the process of the greed and
[32:42] essentially wanting interest and what's
[32:44] in it for me when I give you this money
[32:46] because I know that I'm never going to
[32:47] see you again I know that I'm not
[32:49] getting any food from you I know that
[32:51] I'm not going to get any goods and
[32:52] services from you so I need to get
[32:54] something for this money I'm lending you
[32:56] so social capital failed to scale and it
[33:00] and the system has been imperfect ever
[33:02] since and built on on Greed and toxicity
[33:04] of what can I get I think that the
[33:07] answer to the question Robin of how
[33:09] Bitcoin will send solve The Lending
[33:13] crisis and how people will lend their
[33:16] Bitcoin based on social capital is
[33:19] because under the Bitcoin standard and
[33:21] this is going to take a long time I I'll
[33:23] probably we you and I might both be dead
[33:25] before this takes place because you just
[33:27] need all the old guard to be gone and
[33:31] the human race that's operating entirely
[33:33] off the Bitcoin standard experiencing
[33:36] the abundance that it provides and this
[33:38] goes back to what we were just talking
[33:40] about how once somebody realizes how
[33:42] much abundance Bitcoin really is when
[33:45] you bust it down to the quadrillions of
[33:47] Satoshi the almost infinite amount of
[33:50] decimal it's crazy abundance once the
[33:53] human race is living off that level of
[33:55] abundance I think it will return to
[33:58] Social Capital in the sense that we'll
[34:00] all be tied together by our currency
[34:03] because right now none of us have any
[34:04] allegiance to each other over currency
[34:06] you're dealing in your currency that you
[34:08] deal in in Austria I deal in the
[34:10] currency I'm in America there's hundreds
[34:12] thousands of different currencies we
[34:14] have no allegiance to one another
[34:15] there's no proof of work there's no
[34:17] Integrity with our currency imagine
[34:19] everyone using the same currency
[34:23] experiencing no no only abundance only
[34:27] abundance
[34:28] and now the human mind is no longer in
[34:30] this Rat Race imagine every human being
[34:33] is no longer in this Rat Race scarce
[34:36] mindset of like like I'm so greedy Robin
[34:39] because I'm desperate because I'm in so
[34:41] much debt I'm like if I lend you
[34:43] something I need something back because
[34:45] I'm like starving right I'm in this
[34:47] desperate scarce mindset that I need
[34:50] something back immediately if I lend you
[34:51] something you give me abundance and you
[34:53] give every other human being abundance
[34:55] which is what Bitcoin is now The Lending
[34:58] process becomes like oh my God you need
[35:00] more Bitcoin because you need some
[35:02] Bitcoin to fuel a project that I mean in
[35:05] the future imagine human innovation in
[35:07] the future with AI and whatnot we're
[35:08] going to be doing things that we can't
[35:11] even possibly imagine I mean teaching I
[35:13] teach High School science and even the
[35:16] the kids that I teach that are 10 20
[35:18] years younger than me they're already
[35:19] thinking of ways to they want to visit
[35:22] black holes they want to build
[35:23] structures around they're thinking in
[35:26] space they're thinking in solar system
[35:27] turns Galaxy terms they want to invent
[35:30] Wormhole technology they want it's like
[35:33] we don't have time to be greedy about
[35:36] money anymore we need it now every human
[35:39] being just like and I want to bring it
[35:41] home just like the reason why everybody
[35:43] wants to go live out on their own is
[35:45] that they're just craving that Social
[35:47] Capital again that everybody wants
[35:49] everybody to do well again because like
[35:51] that like the hunter gatherer tribe
[35:52] originally like how we're geared and
[35:54] evolved to be because we spent hundreds
[35:57] and thousands the years in that abundant
[35:59] mindset helping one another Bitcoin I
[36:02] believe will return us to that it will
[36:04] return us to that Social Capital
[36:06] Integrity where it's like Robin I may
[36:08] never even have met you in my life but
[36:09] if we're completely on the Bitcoin
[36:11] standard and for whatever reason you
[36:12] need me to lend you some of my Bitcoin
[36:14] so you could work on your project to
[36:16] propel the human race forward and we're
[36:19] back in that Social Capital mindset and
[36:21] I understand the abundance that
[36:22] bitcoin's giving I'm giving you that
[36:24] Bitcoin I'm giving you that Bitcoin
[36:26] because the proverbial meat going to
[36:27] come back to me because whatever
[36:29] technology you discover using that or
[36:31] whatever advancement you you uh
[36:34] accomplish using that Bitcoin I give you
[36:36] will ultimately benefit me it'll come
[36:38] back around to me sometime so that's how
[36:41] I see it taking care of this lending
[36:43] crisis I think it's it's it is naive it
[36:47] is uh humanist to the core but it's the
[36:50] only way I see us overcoming uh the
[36:53] greed and toxicity with one another and
[36:56] just going back to that
[36:58] that instinctual evolutionary tie that
[37:00] we all have to one another that we all
[37:02] want each other to do well bitcoin's our
[37:04] only hope it's the only money that could
[37:06] possibly bring us to that level of

[39:18] but there will come new models and new
[39:21] amazing designs along the way that's uh
[39:24] that was amazing I love it sound like
[39:31] I I love it a lot like uh I think uh I
[39:34] think it's a long way out till this
[39:36] happens but you mentioned that and I
[39:39] think it's it's it's great uh how how
[39:41] far you are think and and how great that
[39:44] world could actually look like and I
[39:46] think you mentioned it also before with
[39:48] like the connection from Bitcoin and you
[39:51] say now Enlightenment with religion uh
[39:54] and you said like there's a strong
[39:56] connection as you see with Bitcoin and
[39:58] religion uh where do you see that
[40:01] religion I had I think I had uh the the
[40:04] deepest podcast we did on this podcast
[40:07] was with Pastor coin where we talked
[40:09] about uh Bitcoin and the Bible uh I
[40:12] don't know if you saw that one but did
[40:14] you um where is this connection for you
[40:17] between Church religion God and and
[40:21] Bitcoin Robin thank you so much for
[40:23] allowing me to go into this so I have
[40:27] one particular story that really stood
[40:29] out to me and I'm all about the when it
[40:32] comes to religion I just love I love the
[40:34] stories I love the stories and I love
[40:36] the analogies because to me somebody
[40:38] took the time to wrote it down somebody
[40:40] took the time to protect it for
[40:42] thousands of years so we could have it
[40:44] so I mean I think you could be a total
[40:47] um you know Nichi nihilist and and read
[40:51] the religious text whether it's the
[40:53] Bible or the Quran or anything you want
[40:55] of the 10,000 religions and get
[40:56] something from it because it must have
[40:58] some value if somebody wrote it down and
[41:00] protected it me personally most likely
[41:02] because I'm just a Westerner I read the
[41:05] Bible for my analogies and my metaphors
[41:07] and my wisdom and I do have several
[41:10] stories that that I like with Bitcoin
[41:12] but one in particular is the David and
[41:15] Goliath story I love the David and
[41:17] Goliath story for the the the Bitcoin
[41:20] story because we're both you're both
[41:23] characters we're both characters and I
[41:25] want to break down first the character
[41:28] of uh Goliath so Goliath is really
[41:30] interesting because he's this like big
[41:33] dude six foot for back in his day and
[41:36] what stood out to me when I was reading
[41:38] his story and I was like oh that's like
[41:39] kind of Bitcoin is his
[41:42] armor they call so back their money was
[41:45] shekels and in his time the shekele was
[41:47] made of bronze and what these Warriors
[41:50] would do is every time they survived a
[41:52] campaign they'd get paid in shekels and
[41:55] then they'd melt the shekels down and
[41:57] they'd add it to their armor so Goliath
[41:59] was notable on the battlefield because
[42:02] he'd survived so many battles in
[42:05] campaigns that his armor was like 600
[42:08] shekels that was the value of it he had
[42:11] full head to toe thick bronze armor
[42:14] because every time he survived a
[42:16] campaign which I was thinking it's like
[42:18] every time you make it through another
[42:19] having every time you go four years if
[42:21] you buy Bitcoin and you go four years
[42:24] you're adding to your your wealth your
[42:26] armor just like goath I mean he he he
[42:28] lasted so many uh
[42:57] cycle and you survive that first four
[42:59] years of Happ and you hold on to it it's
[43:00] just like it's just going to keep
[43:02] growing that arm you're going to feel
[43:04] empowered and then another four years
[43:06] look at all the ogs that you have come
[43:08] on to this podcast who are most of them
[43:11] they're just doing what they love uh you
[43:12] had that comic book writer on the other
[43:14] day he's like just enjoying doing his
[43:16] Comics because his Bitcoin armor is so
[43:18] powerful at this point because he's
[43:20] waited it out and you know these ogs you
[43:22] got to give them credit it's like they
[43:24] bought and they held and they they
[43:26] played the game 10 years 10 all the
[43:28] whole time they they've survived they're
[43:30] the true original Warriors they're the
[43:32] goliaths because they withstood the
[43:34] campaigns in order to have that that
[43:36] armor like Goliath had and now they get
[43:37] to do what they love and uh with their
[43:40] armor on so that character really stood
[43:43] out to me as a bitcoiner because if you
[43:45] if you want to become Goliath buy some
[43:48] Bitcoin and then just weather the
[43:50] weather the battles whether the whether
[43:52] the storms whether the
[43:57] eventually you're going to be that
[43:58] Warrior out on the battlefield who
[44:00] everybody's looking at who everybody's
[44:02] like oh my God look at that that awesome
[44:04] that badass you know you're gonna be a
[44:06] badass so I love that character from The
[44:08] Bible and I he he's basically a he's a
[44:11] Sheeler you know you're a bitcoiner that
[44:13] you're the same you're just gonna only
[44:15] grow in power and empowerment and then
[44:17] alternatively uh going over to the other
[44:19] side of that story David you know I love
[44:22] the story of David because he's
[44:24] basically he's a guy that comes from
[44:25] nothing he's nothing he's the youngest
[44:28] son of a shepherd and the shepherd you
[44:30] know in the Bible everybody gets this
[44:32] awesome name it's like his dad's name is
[44:33] Jesse just gets this little simple name
[44:35] and he's the youngest son of Jesse he
[44:37] doesn't even get to join the military
[44:39] that's how low Prestige he is how low
[44:42] Prestige he is the only reason he enters
[44:44] the story is he's bringing food to his
[44:45] brothers on the front line and while
[44:47] he's on the front line he sees that
[44:49] there's this guy Goliath coming out
[44:50] every day and challenging all the
[44:52] Israelites to a one-on-one and if they
[44:54] could beat him it'll determine the war
[44:56] and all these Israelites are cowering in
[44:58] fear they're scared it's a story of fear
[45:00] Robin so the thing is there's so many
[45:02] people right now that want to buy
[45:04] Bitcoin but they're they're afraid
[45:06] they're afraid because it's a war
[45:09] because it's a lot of volatility because
[45:11] it's going to take time and so the word
[45:13] here is David is a story of what's
[45:16] called conviction because David shows up
[45:18] to the battle and he sees that all the
[45:21] Israelites are scared of Goliath and he
[45:23] sees that none of them want to go out
[45:24] and fight him because they know if they
[45:25] lose they lose the war because back then
[45:28] a one-on-one meant if you did a
[45:30] one-on-one whoever won that side won so
[45:33] you were risking your whole nation if
[45:35] you took the fight so David he sees his
[45:37] opportunity just like so many people
[45:40] right now have an opportunity to
[45:41] actually buy a significant amount of
[45:43] Bitcoin you've had so many people on
[45:46] that have made it abundantly clear that
[45:48] even if you're just 01 0.1
[45:53] 0.1 there's no better time than right
[45:55] now to take that to go out onto that
[45:57] Battlefield have some conviction and buy
[45:59] it but you literally have to have a
[46:01] conviction the level of David's because
[46:04] when David overcame that fear he did it
[46:07] he went all in he went all in he saw his
[46:10] opportunity he went to the king he
[46:12] requested that one V one the King was
[46:14] like no way no way but David was like
[46:16] trust me I will beat this guy I I I'm
[46:19] convicted I'll go out there I'll kill
[46:20] him you can believe in me I'm going to
[46:22] go on on this 100% he put his very life
[46:25] on it to go out there to have a chance
[46:27] and the reason he did it Robin and so
[46:29] many people I think could relate to this
[46:30] is because so many of us we're nothing
[46:34] we have nothing we're so in debt we're
[46:37] we're living with so much scarce
[46:39] Financial scarcity you have to be David
[46:42] you have to go out and take a big chance
[46:43] you have to and you're G to feel fear if
[46:45] you didn't feel fear it's probably the
[46:47] wrong direction it's probably the wrong
[46:49] direction and you're going to have to
[46:50] have conviction like David had and sure
[46:54] enough you know he goes out there and
[46:55] risk he puts his Nation on the line he
[46:57] puts his life on the line he puts his
[47:00] family's Honor on the line he put
[47:01] everything on the line and he won and he
[47:06] won because he overcame his fear and he
[47:08] went all in and what's beautiful about
[47:10] him is just like Bitcoin he wins that
[47:13] fight but if anybody who ever wants to
[47:15] read the story of David from the B it
[47:17] goes on for like the next 40 years it
[47:19] takes him another 40 years after he wins
[47:21] that fight to fully see the fruit of his
[47:25] victory so it's a combination of it's
[47:28] just pure conviction so you need to be
[47:29] David if you're going into be a
[47:31] bitcoiner you have to just go into it
[47:33] knowing that this is a a journey that's
[47:35] going to last the rest of your life
[47:37] because that's what it's going to take
[47:38] to see it all play out and if you do it
[47:41] though just like David you'll go from a
[47:43] Shepherd the lowest of low the youngest
[47:46] of a Shepherd son nothing to the
[47:49] greatest king of all time if you just
[47:51] have that conviction and conviction
[47:54] comes from education you have to watch
[47:56] all around Robin's videos you got to
[47:57] watch all of everybody's videos that's
[47:59] what it took for me to hold on to my
[48:01] Bitcoin that's what takes you know what
[48:02] the reason I love uh I love you Robin is
[48:05] because I need that conviction every day
[48:09] that's why I like your podcast because
[48:10] you're every day if I could if I watch
[48:12] one of your videos every day I'm like
[48:15] keeps my conviction strong and that's
[48:17] that's all you need you just need that
[48:19] conviction to just keep going so be
[48:23] Goliath buy your Bitcoin to empower
[48:25] yourself and be that David knowing that
[48:28] overcome that fear get your Bitcoin and
[48:30] then embark on your your journey to
[48:32] become king or queen you know even for
[48:34] you ladies out there applies to
[48:36] both that's just one story Robin
[48:40] amazing amazing well that that that
[48:43] story is really good and I wanted to say
[48:46] it later but I think I will say it even
[48:49] now I think you're are a really good
[48:50] speaker and you're a great guest already
[48:53] uh and it's it honors me that you chose
[48:56] my podcast as uh to be the first podcast
[49:00] you you air on uh and I hope and I think
[49:03] you will be on many more podcasts and uh
[49:06] I think you started also your own uh
[49:08] YouTube channel and I think you you
[49:10] should expand on that and take all those
[49:12] small stories that you you tell here
[49:15] maybe expand on them take them out and
[49:18] like do a video every week or something
[49:19] like that I think that would be a great
[49:21] hit and I wish you already a a really
[49:24] good thing with that because I those
[49:26] those stories are genuinely uh
[49:28] interesting like that that are not just
[49:31] uh and I have a Bitcoin conversation
[49:33] every day so yeah like for for me to be
[49:36] something interesting like it it just
[49:39] has to be something unique and different
[49:42] uh and so like that's something really
[49:44] cool I never heard the David and go live
[49:46] story like that related to bitcoin and I
[49:49] think you have many more of them uh that
[49:52] would uh be just too many for for that
[49:55] one podcast so I think you have a great
[49:58] you have a great way to expand on that
[50:00] in in your own channels and I and I
[50:02] would love to to see that and and you
[50:04] thriving on on on YouTube and on other
[50:06] platforms that that would be great for
[50:08] me to see gosh thank you so much Robin
[50:11] that means a lot appreciate that I'm
[50:13] honored to be here the the pleasure is
[50:15] all mine you're the man thank you thank
[50:17] you very much yeah uh daily podcast is
[50:20] is is the best thing uh you can do like
[50:22] every day having the conviction and and
[50:24] putting out something it's it's it's a
[50:26] full-time job but it's a something that
[50:29] I love to do every day it's it's
[50:31] Saturday evening and I would not like to
[50:34] do anything else honestly it's it's so
[50:36] great to do exactly that what I'm doing
[50:39] but back to the story um when we come
[50:42] now to David K and we model this story a
[50:46] little bit differently and we say that
[50:48] David is is is Bitcoin that tries to
[50:51] bring that gol down and goli is kind of
[50:54] that that that Fiat system
[50:57] um how long do you think if at all will
[51:02] that take like I think you already
[51:05] spoiled that you you think that the fear
[51:07] system will go away and then we come to
[51:09] that Bitcoin system where this this this
[51:11] world is thing but do you have some
[51:13] where like okay this this takes five
[51:16] years this takes 100 years like do do
[51:19] you have some rough estimate where like
[51:21] that's the time frame you you think of
[51:24] how how long it will take obviously it's
[51:25] a very speculative question but it's
[51:28] it's fun to to talk
[51:30] about yeah it really is it really is and
[51:33] it's it's a great question Robin and
[51:35] it's it's very ambiguous for sure
[51:37] because you know I think uh well you
[51:40] know what I got to go back to uh Ray
[51:42] Dalia's changing world order book
[51:44] because essentially what he pointed out
[51:47] is civilizations go through six phases
[51:51] basically and I won't touch up on any of
[51:53] the phases because I would actually need
[51:54] to go read the book but we're in what's
[51:58] called phase five of six which is verge
[52:02] of Revolution Phase verge of Revolution
[52:04] Phase and if you never do read uh if
[52:08] anyone out there never does read
[52:09] changing World Order basically what it
[52:10] is is a ray Delia is a multi-billionaire
[52:13] who uses AI to just analyze tens of
[52:16] thousands of civilizations the rise and
[52:18] Falls of
[52:19] civilizations and he got some very good
[52:24] data that just applies to all of them
[52:27] so what it would take for Bitcoin to
[52:30] replace Fiat is a revolution a
[52:34] full-blown Revolution now
[52:36] revolutions are one or the other they're
[52:38] peaceful revolutions or they're violent
[52:41] revolutions now the majority of
[52:43] revolutions again based on Ray Delio's
[52:46] research are violent revolutions most of
[52:49] them higher percentage are violent
[52:51] Revolutions a small percentage of them
[52:53] are peaceful revolutions like Gandhi
[52:56] Gandhi India Revolution would be an
[52:57] example of a peaceful Revolution they're
[52:59] hard to pull off most of them are
[53:01] violent like the Bolshevik Revolution in
[53:03] Russia 197 and God you're in an area of
[53:07] Europe Robin you know more about the
[53:08] being violent revolutions all over in
[53:10] Europe I mean look at most of them were
[53:12] violent
[53:13] right what it would take and we're in
[53:15] Phase five so when you're looking at
[53:17] timelines one thing that Ray Doo has
[53:20] discovered is Phase five can last
[53:23] anywhere from tomorrow to about 200
[53:27] years that's what he's seen zero to 200
[53:31] years before a revolution on a scale
[53:34] that can
[53:35] overturn a world order takes place so
[53:40] that seems like a long time for you and
[53:42] I and any one human because our lifespan
[53:45] is here in the United States 70s so it
[53:48] would seem like a long time but all of
[53:51] us are educated enough now to know that
[53:55] 70 years is nothing 200 years is
[53:58] nothing so you know for for Bitcoin to
[54:02] topple the fiat currency you would need
[54:03] the Fiat system to just essentially
[54:05] completely fail through
[54:09] Revolution most likely violent
[54:11] revolution so really it's how many how
[54:14] close are we to this is a tough one
[54:16] Robin because you know and I don't even
[54:20] talk about this but I am an Iraqi War
[54:22] veteran uh former US Marine and when
[54:25] you've SE a war you don't wish it on
[54:29] anyone or anything and so you never
[54:32] want this is a tough one because as much
[54:35] as you want the Bitcoin standard and you
[54:39] realize gosh you almost I feel almost
[54:41] emotional about it because it's like you
[54:43] want it so bad you want the Bitcoin
[54:45] standard and everything we talked about
[54:47] earlier that Utopia and world of
[54:50] abundance and Social Capital to happen
[54:53] but deep down you know that it's going
[54:56] to take
[54:57] a lot of violence for it to happen most
[54:59] likely and a violent revolution for it
[55:01] to happen so it's like a ju a position
[55:06] to say well God I want it tomorrow but I
[55:08] know what that means I know what that
[55:10] means is it's going to take a revolution
[55:12] for it to happen so but that's just
[55:15] getting too emotional in it all emotions
[55:17] aside um and just being calculated about
[55:20] this I see I see a revolution if I was
[55:23] saying if I just had to go for it
[55:26] probably in the next 30 maybe I'd give
[55:29] it 40 50
[55:30] years I give it 40 50 years Max before I
[55:34] mean we can't it could happen tomorrow
[55:37] but I think at most at most this system
[55:40] we're in right now um you know the game
[55:43] cyber Punk
[55:44] 2077 that's a perfect timeline I think
[55:47] by 2077 2077 this thing goes
[55:52] down 50 years this thing can't last more
[55:54] than 50 years r it can't go for more
[55:57] than 50 years like it is now there's no
[55:58] way and then it's either going to be
[56:00] peaceful Revolution or violent and
[56:02] that's just is what it is and then
[56:04] whoever's left afterwards if it's
[56:05] peaceful a lot of us if it's violent
[56:08] just a few more Bitcoin are for just a
[56:11] few I guess but then then Bitcoin will
[56:14] be the Bitcoin standard will arise it'll
[56:18] it'll be the it's the only way it'll be
[56:20] the money that's left because everything
[56:21] else will be gone it'll just be the
[56:23] Bitcoin that's left after that
[56:25] Revolution and then that's all then
[56:27] we'll be good you just have to survive
[56:30] it 50 years 50
[56:33] years that's such an interesting topic
[56:35] because when you think of
[56:37] other uh technical advancements and uh
[56:42] Bitcoin replacing feat is way more than
[56:44] a technical advancement it's a
[56:45] revolution as you said uh because you
[56:47] have to it's also turn to Power and and
[56:51] and way more things but if you purely
[56:54] look at technical advancements like like
[56:56] from the horse to the car it took a long
[57:00] time like it took like 30 40 years to
[57:03] really take like Mass market and there's
[57:05] still people riding on horses still
[57:09] horses as as a as a means of Transport
[57:14] is still there even like 100 years later
[57:17] even though we have the car for so long
[57:20] and we know a motorcycle is way more
[57:23] efficient than a horse uh but a horse is
[57:26] still around and they they still do it
[57:29] more for like other reasons than just
[57:31] coming around but yeah uh so it will be
[57:35] interesting to see how great this
[57:38] network effect of feat is because
[57:41] there's this thing where like does the
[57:46] uh current system cling on to the power
[57:49] of the field system or do they realize
[57:52] that they have to adopt now Bitcoin as
[57:56] fast as possible otherwise they might
[57:59] fight the war and stand on the other
[58:01] side of the war and don't have anything
[58:03] they just have the fear money so like I
[58:05] think we will probably come to a point
[58:08] where at some point all the greatest
[58:10] World forces will fight for as many
[58:14] Sates as they can get like this this
[58:16] game the will definitely play on I hope
[58:18] it will be uh peaceful that's why I
[58:22] always advocate for self- custody as
[58:24] much as possible
[58:26] um uh and I think it's it will be a
[58:30] great world but the transition period
[58:33] could be interesting and could not be
[58:35] peaceful um on the other side it will be
[58:38] amazing uh and for us it will be very
[58:41] interesting in the next 50 to 100 years
[58:44] so I I'm now 25 so in 50 years I'm the
[58:47] 75 so my whole life probably will be
[58:51] within this transition phase and yes I
[58:55] will uh document everything on my
[58:57] podcast till I die so it will be very
[59:00] interesting to have my my life basically
[59:03] as a documentary with all those amazing
[59:06] people and guests that I speak on and I
[59:09] want to expand like I want to really
[59:11] like just travel to Salvador travel to
[59:13] Nigeria travel to those places where the
[59:15] adoption is already high and really make
[59:18] documentaries around that and interview
[59:19] people on the ground and do those types
[59:22] of contents also but that's like a a
[59:26] sneak preview maybe for for next year or
[59:28] next next year for my channel that that
[59:30] will be a later project will not happen
[59:33] this year um and uh I think I think it
[59:37] will be amazing to see and amazing to
[59:39] watch one last um uh question that I
[59:42] have for you today is what did Bitcoin
[59:45] already do for your personal uh Freedom
[59:49] as you uh came from a Dept feared slave
[59:53] world uh you still have that but you
[59:56] already have uh Bitcoin so how how how
[59:59] much did Bitcoin do to your personal
[60:02] freedom and how much more free do you
[60:04] feel in in general great question Robin
[60:06] I gotta tell you I feel so much better
[60:09] you know uh a big issue here in the
[60:11] United States is mental illness because
[60:14] a lot of us have a lot of despair of the
[60:16] future and we don't feel like we have
[60:18] hope in the future and just having all
[60:22] of that being replaced with hope and Joy
[60:26] has just so freed up so much uh mental
[60:30] angst for me knowing that I have a light
[60:35] at the end of the tunnel and knowing
[60:36] that hey in my lifetime if I have to
[60:39] play the Fiat game and exchange some of
[60:42] my Bitcoin for Fiat here and there in
[60:45] order to just get the system off my back
[60:48] get these loans off my back my mortgage
[60:51] off my back my student loans off my back
[60:53] just just leave me alone and the fact
[60:55] that I know that the Bitcoin I have on a
[60:58] long enough timeline and this is what's
[61:00] beautiful for we're talking what we our
[61:03] conversation was just taken into effect
[61:06] 50 hundred years right but hey I mean
[61:08] this kid when you're looking at it just
[61:11] within the system we're in now there
[61:13] could be huge results just coming the
[61:15] end of this year I mean Robin maybe at
[61:17] the end of this year I'm I'm out of my
[61:19] debt slave crisis it seriously it could
[61:21] come that fast I mean this thing once it
[61:22] takes off for its second big run I we're
[61:26] looking at potentially some big numbers
[61:29] and all of us who are holding right now
[61:31] you know then we're going to be the
[61:32] second generation ogs who are just doing
[61:35] exactly what we love and whatnot so what
[61:38] it's done for me in the immediate is
[61:39] really a lot of it's just taken a huge
[61:42] weight off my shoulders it's taken it's
[61:45] freed up a lot of my brain power because
[61:47] I no longer need to be using that on my
[61:50] financial life it actually has made me a
[61:52] better teacher it's made me a better
[61:54] husband it's made me a better father
[61:55] because now I'm using all my brain power
[61:57] for what I love to do and I'm just
[61:59] letting Bitcoin take care of all of my
[62:02] finances and it's and the volatility is
[62:04] just the volatility I just mean I just
[62:06] know hoddle right I'm a hodler so we're
[62:08] good to go and furthermore I think you
[62:11] know this conversation is made when you
[62:15] have children when you have children you
[62:17] just instinctively you want to be able
[62:19] to give them something that will matter
[62:23] and one thing that was like really a
[62:26] was hurting me was thinking that I
[62:28] didn't have anything that I was going to
[62:29] be able to leave my children whenever it
[62:32] is that I'm
[62:33] gone and this is where I love self-
[62:37] custody because it's like I'm putting a
[62:40] portion of
[62:41] Bitcoin somewhere stacked far away it's
[62:45] theirs put it on my bit box put it in a
[62:49] in a lock and I had just like the
[62:51] thought of one day being able to hand my
[62:53] children their Bitcoin
[62:56] because I can't even imagine what
[62:57] they're going to do with it you've had
[62:58] so many guests that I'm a dinosaur I
[63:01] look at Bitcoin financially you've got
[63:03] guests that are using it to it's the
[63:07] Ecclesiastes it should be the answer to
[63:09] everything I'm at peace knowing that
[63:12] Bitcoin is the answer to everything it
[63:14] actually solved Ecclesiastes existential
[63:18] question he didn't get to see it in his
[63:20] time and he was actually kind of a
[63:21] depressed guy I don't have to be that I
[63:24] know that God only knows what my
[63:25] children going to do with Bitcoin got to
[63:28] only know what what's possible with it
[63:30] it's wonderful to be able to have
[63:32] something that is valuable to pass on to
[63:34] my children it's wonderful to have
[63:36] something that any day now will just
[63:39] completely free me from my Fiat debt
[63:43] slave status and there will that day
[63:45] will come whether it's tomorrow whether
[63:47] it's 10 years from now whether it's 20
[63:48] years from now un fortunate I'm 37 I
[63:52] plan to live to be 150 darn it so I know
[63:54] it's gonna happen
[63:56] so it's just tons of Hope Robin it's
[63:58] tons of Hope in in the in the short mid
[64:01] and long term it's just an enormous
[64:03] amount of Hope which brings a lot of Joy
[64:05] which has really uh made me mentally
[64:08] happy not mentally ill it's brought me a
[64:10] lot of happiness and that means a lot to
[64:12] me I love satos I love Bitcoin and I
[64:16] love my fellow bitcoiners and I just
[64:17] want to stretch this out one more thing
[64:19] on the mental health is and this is
[64:21] because I'm a teacher you know I have I
[64:23] teach science so stem is in trouble
[64:25] trouble stem is science technical
[64:28] engineering mathematics so many young
[64:30] people right now in the United States
[64:31] are just
[64:33] depressed they have they have no hope
[64:35] for their future they have nowhere to
[64:37] put all their intellectual power they
[64:40] have no Community they have no community
[64:42] of friends and things they care
[64:45] about and again Bitcoin is the answer to
[64:47] everything get these I tell all my
[64:49] students this is not Financial advice
[64:51] this is just advice to help you get some
[64:55] Bitcoin
[64:56] take a hundred bucks and buy some
[64:57] Bitcoin just so you have it it's giving
[65:00] an outlet because this is this is a big
[65:02] part of what Bitcoin is doing for me to
[65:03] still answer your question it's
[65:05] improving the lives of the people around
[65:07] me because especially these young people
[65:10] right we have young people who are in
[65:11] America who are shooting people who are
[65:13] being violent who are so hopeless that
[65:16] they're killing people killing
[65:19] themselves and they need an outlet and
[65:22] Bitcoin gives them that it gives them a
[65:24] reason to be a scientist it gives them a
[65:26] reason to be get into Tech into
[65:28] engineering into mathematics you've had
[65:30] so many young people come on your
[65:32] podcast Robin with innovations that blow
[65:35] my mind from mining equipment in your
[65:38] house to election in Integrity uh
[65:42] systems to more things than I could even
[65:45] I have to go through and watch your
[65:46] whole Library again just to remember all
[65:48] the Innovations and that's just what a
[65:50] year and it's just going to keep being
[65:52] used for more and more and then most
[65:54] importantly it's community
[65:56] I'm a guy who if I'm not teaching and
[65:58] I'm not with my family I just like to be
[66:00] alone but I started watching your
[66:02] podcast and I like had to reach out to
[66:05] you because I just was like I need this
[66:07] community it just brings out this sense
[66:10] in community I would have never thought
[66:11] to reach out to anyone on YouTube ever
[66:15] and try and actually have a conversation
[66:16] with them but Bitcoin provides us with
[66:19] such a community I like had to talk to
[66:22] you because just you being a Bitcoin
[66:25] here Robin I'm already like we're good I
[66:29] run into somebody out on the streets
[66:31] they can be the opposite of me in every
[66:33] which way and that's fine but they own
[66:36] some Bitcoin it's like we're a community
[66:39] instantly bitcoiners are just it's the
[66:42] best community it's full of just hopeful
[66:45] intelligent Innovative
[66:48] loving kind interesting
[66:51] people and that is just the greatest
[66:54] thing to see being somebody who is
[66:57] essentially uh Allin on you know I'm not
[67:00] one of the people that wants to go live
[67:02] by myself out in the middle of the woods
[67:03] I want a society I want to love the
[67:05] people that I'm in society with I want
[67:07] to see my Society Thrive I want to see
[67:10] us all have a common Bond and uh Bitcoin
[67:14] is the answer to that that's what it's
[67:15] done for me that's so beautiful uh I I
[67:19] love that a lot uh Derek that was that
[67:21] was really cool um just a quick uh
[67:24] saying about uh meeting other bitcoiners
[67:28] I think that's a great possibility
[67:30] meeting other Bitcoins in real life
[67:32] having those conversations I don't like
[67:35] assum just Google meets is great but
[67:38] actually going to a local Bitcoin meet
[67:41] up actually going to yeah Bitcoin
[67:44] conference like Bitcoin brag uh is is
[67:46] one of my favorites because it's just
[67:48] like that all everyone is there and it's
[67:50] for me just like four days that I
[67:52] blocked in my calendar and I'm like up
[67:55] from 5 in the morning till like midnight
[67:58] and then just go and meet as many
[67:59] bitcoiners as possible because that's I
[68:02] get from those four days more energy
[68:06] than like from the rest of the
[68:08] year as a as a feeling like it's it's so
[68:11] amazing to meet those bitcoiners online
[68:14] just a quick uh Service Announcement if
[68:16] you plan to go to next year's Bitcoin PR
[68:19] conference which is a long way out but
[68:23] uh because the the last one was uh like
[68:25] just two months ago but there are now
[68:28] really cheap T tickets out there and you
[68:30] can uh also use code Robin again they're
[68:33] not a sponsor of this podcast but I just
[68:35] love connecting people and I saw the
[68:38] magic happening in Bitcoin brag and if I
[68:41] can facilitate that in any way shape or
[68:45] form I happily do that and I think like
[68:49] the tickets I have to look at by they
[68:51] they're like really cheap in in the in
[68:53] in the early days now and then they get
[68:55] get little bit uh more expensive then
[68:57] and if you could use just code Robin
[68:59] then you get even more off but yeah uh
[69:02] from that uh I think meeting other
[69:05] bitcoiners is amazing and it's so
[69:07] important to do one one more uh question
[69:11] that I just thought about um you brought
[69:13] up mental health issue and I think
[69:17] that's something that I don't speak
[69:22] enough about on my podcast uh and I'm
[69:25] thankful that you brought it up because
[69:27] it's a really interesting thing that we
[69:29] have to discuss do you think that most
[69:32] of that comes from the Fiat system or is
[69:35] like also big part of mental health
[69:37] issue yeah we're just humans and we will
[69:39] always have those and it's it's hard to
[69:42] be a human kind of or is that a lot of
[69:46] those issues actually come from feat and
[69:48] from A system that is stealing from us
[69:50] and because it's stealing from us we
[69:52] don't trust each other then anymore and
[69:54] losing those personal connections yeah
[69:57] that's a great question Robin and that's
[69:59] yeah that's heavy because the the root
[70:01] cause is certainly a lack of purpose
[70:05] that's where mental illness comes from
[70:06] it's a lack of purpose you always have
[70:07] to go to the root cause and then you got
[70:09] to look at what's causing the symptoms
[70:12] right and absolutely where we're at
[70:15] right now in the Fiat system is a cause
[70:17] of those symptoms because ultimately
[70:19] where we're at in the Fiat system is
[70:24] it's taking away opportunity now because
[70:27] the wealth Gap and this again it just
[70:30] happens it happens in every Fiat system
[70:33] cycle and then it restarts and then you
[70:36] get more opportunity you know we
[70:37] wouldn't be having this conversation if
[70:39] we were living in say postor War II
[70:42] America Fiat system this would be like
[70:44] oh my God we're in the greatest times
[70:46] ever like God bless Fiat this is amazing
[70:48] all of us have jobs no one had hardly
[70:50] anyone unless you were I mean the fact
[70:52] that World War II veterans we saw the
[70:53] most horrible vicious things could come
[70:56] back and relatively make it through life
[70:59] with not as nearly as many mental
[71:00] illnesses as we have right now tells you
[71:02] how much better off they were but the
[71:05] cycle that we're in right now in the
[71:07] Fiat system is taking away opportunity
[71:10] for the majority of people to do what
[71:12] they love because either they don't have
[71:14] access to education in order to get to
[71:17] the place they want to be or in order to
[71:19] get that education they have to become a
[71:21] debt slave and then have that financial
[71:24] burden hovering over their head and
[71:26] because people aren't able through
[71:28] financial means to do what they love
[71:30] then they're missing out on what their
[71:32] God's calling is and they're calling to
[71:35] do their
[71:36] purpose and therefore absolutely if you
[71:39] don't have the financial
[71:42] means then you certainly have less
[71:45] opportunity to do what you love and that
[71:49] 100% contributes enormously to mental
[71:52] illness I'm sure this isn't something
[71:54] you know you yes to credit and this is
[71:56] just I'm just free just kind of free
[71:58] flowing now is I bet if you did do an
[72:00] in-depth study you would certainly find
[72:03] that as the wealth Gap increases the
[72:06] level of mental illness Rises because we
[72:09] certainly have an increasing wealth Gap
[72:11] that just happens to most certainly
[72:13] without even reading anything correlate
[72:14] to an increase in mental illness so you
[72:18] have to you do have to put some blame on
[72:20] the fiat currency certainly some blame
[72:23] too on just the breakdown
[72:27] God I guess it always does tie into the
[72:28] Fiat because it's the breakdown of
[72:30] family you know a lot of my students
[72:32] don't have a family uh and the biggest
[72:35] reason families break up money Financial
[72:39] stress breaks part most
[72:41] families and then that just stems from
[72:43] there so yeah the more I kind of work
[72:46] this out while I'm talking about it
[72:47] after you asked that
[72:49] question it it is it is it is the issue
[72:52] with the Fiat system that people have me
[72:55] illness it's a huge issue absolutely
[72:58] 100% Robin because it's not providing
[73:00] people the financial stability they need
[73:02] to be the best version of themselves
[73:04] it's just not providing people it has a
[73:06] great thing to do with it absolutely
[73:08] very true um as you know my tin uh when
[73:12] you watch my videos is like two
[73:13] questions and one question is always the
[73:15] same for everyone my guests um what can
[73:18] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[73:20] all the things that we already talked
[73:22] about on the podcast yeah I was looking
[73:24] forward to this one I love this one and
[73:25] keep it super simple go out and have
[73:29] access to Nature get away from all of
[73:33] this all of this have a place where you
[73:36] could get away from all of this have it
[73:39] right where you
[73:40] live I say and there's a lot of ways
[73:42] this looks like for me it's my backyard
[73:45] that's my place I go out and I grow my
[73:49] plants and I watch the birds and I watch
[73:53] the bees pollinate the flowers that grow
[73:56] and I just sit back there and I don't
[73:57] even think about anything other than
[73:59] just this
[74:01] is nature and this is just have a place
[74:04] to get away from all of this even even
[74:07] Bitcoin take a break have a place to
[74:09] just take a break from everything where
[74:11] you could just be nothing and the way I
[74:14] do that is by just creating a a piece of
[74:17] Nature close by I know people who they
[74:20] put house plants if you're living in
[74:22] like a condo or an apartment have a
[74:25] portion of your little condo or your
[74:27] studio I used to live in a 500 square
[74:28] foot studio for a long time with my wife
[74:31] just my wife and I we had a little
[74:32] corner just a little nature corner just
[74:34] go there sit with the plants and just
[74:37] take a break be nothing leave your cell
[74:39] phone turn off everything and just go
[74:41] have a place that you could be where
[74:43] you're nothing and just be a part of
[74:45] nature even if it's just a house plant
[74:47] in you in the corner of a room I'm very
[74:49] blessed I get to go into a backyard and
[74:52] grow plants and just sit there and watch
[74:54] the ants and the bees and the and the
[74:57] other animals that aren't us because
[74:58] we're just one tiny little speck of this
[75:03] world it's not all about us it's
[75:05] actually very little about us go and
[75:07] watch what it's all about what
[75:09] everything else is doing and just be
[75:11] nothing and when you come back from that
[75:14] you feel so refreshed so take a break
[75:16] from all this and have a place where you
[75:18] could go be nothing and
[75:20] just watch what else is going on out
[75:22] there that's not has anything to do with
[75:25] humans go watch what the bees and the
[75:27] birds and the plants are doing cuz
[75:28] they're true they're so true that's
[75:30] beautiful thank you man thank you
[75:34] Robin it helps me a lot I love it a lot
[75:37] andot I love that a lot it's it's truly
[75:40] beautiful um now let's come to the
[75:43] actual end routine where the previous
[75:45] guest is asking a question for the next
[75:46] guest without knowing who the next guest
[75:48] actually is um and your question is an
[75:51] interesting one um I I will explain a
[75:54] little bit um before the question uh
[75:58] usually um when when we want the free
[76:01] market and we go to the extreme of the
[76:03] free market we don't want to have any
[76:05] Central Authority saying to us anything
[76:09] about what they want or how it should be
[76:12] so the free market should take care of
[76:14] everything so that would also mean that
[76:16] the government services like servicing
[76:19] the streets uh making hospitals uh and
[76:23] and guarding the the streets and have
[76:25] Monopoly and violence and all those
[76:27] things that now is kind of in every
[76:29] country the the the case
[76:32] um is it possible can we put all those
[76:36] government services to the free market
[76:40] or is there always a place for
[76:42] centralized authority to have maybe
[76:45] hospitals maybe other things uh in their
[76:49] power or can we have this free market
[76:51] where everything is in in private hands
[76:53] that is a good question that's a
[76:55] powerful question I'm so happy that
[76:57] earlier we I I would have been stumped
[77:00] on this question if we didn't talk
[77:02] earlier about the social capital with
[77:04] hunter gatherers and how potentially in
[77:06] the future Bitcoin becomes our new
[77:10] system of proof of work and and social
[77:13] capitalism so there's this interesting
[77:14] philosophy that so on to answer that
[77:17] question as it stands right
[77:19] now if we maintain the fiat currency
[77:22] there will always need to be Central
[77:24] govern government collecting some form
[77:26] of taxes regulating building the roads
[77:30] making sure people aren't doing horrible
[77:33] things to one another financially
[77:36] physically you can't get over that you
[77:38] will need central government under our
[77:40] current system and the Fiat system
[77:42] because it's a system of greed and and
[77:44] power hungry and what's in it for me not
[77:47] for you when you have that oh you need
[77:50] Central Authority that's why it exists
[77:52] right it's filling a certain power
[77:53] vacuum so if it stays that way forever
[77:56] then the answer to that question is yes
[77:59] you will always need some form of
[78:00] central Authority collecting some
[78:03] resources from everyone because they're
[78:05] going to just refuse to give it up if
[78:07] someone doesn't just take it so we could
[78:09] have schools police fire roads
[78:13] whatnot now in this future Utopia that
[78:18] we kind of looked at a little bit
[78:20] earlier where honestly the word Anarchy
[78:23] comes to mind and I learned this from my
[78:25] psychology teacher and because I when I
[78:27] was younger I was a a bit of a Ruffian
[78:30] and I like the thought of Anarchy
[78:31] because when you're 15 or 16 you just
[78:34] have a lot of testosterone you want to
[78:37] go out and go medal on the world but I
[78:40] remember my psychology teacher one day
[78:42] he's a really really wise man he took me
[78:43] aside he goes you know what Anarchy
[78:45] really is right and I said I said no
[78:47] it's going around and just being kind of
[78:49] chaotic evil right he said no it's the
[78:51] complete opposite it's the complete
[78:53] opposite Anarchy is a State when every
[78:56] human being is given the ultimate
[78:59] freedom of Liberty and they choose to be
[79:02] the most righteous loving kind people
[79:05] with that Liberty and freedom that's
[79:08] Anarchy that's the philosophy of Anarchy
[79:11] is when the humankind can reach that
[79:13] point that's true Anarchy that's I think
[79:15] the closest country to that is like
[79:16] Sweden for instance they're supposedly
[79:19] like social anarchists right they just
[79:22] look out for one another the Swedish
[79:23] just giving giving give to one another
[79:25] so they could just create this Society
[79:27] of abundance I probably shouldn't even
[79:29] go there because I don't know a lot
[79:30] about geopolitics in that area but the
[79:33] answer to that question is we can remove
[79:36] Central
[79:37] Authority if we adopt the idea that each
[79:40] and every one of us is that idealistic
[79:44] Anarchist that each one of us can have
[79:48] as much freedom and liberty as we want
[79:50] so long as we make the choice to be the
[79:53] most loving kind giving people and that
[79:58] only happens under the Bitcoin standard
[80:01] for all the reasons we talked about
[80:02] earlier the fact that there's so much
[80:04] abundance with it because then you don't
[80:07] need a central Authority going around
[80:09] regulating everything because if I need
[80:11] a road built outside of my house I'm
[80:14] going to do everything individually
[80:16] possible to make it happen and if that
[80:18] crew says they need some of my Bitcoin
[80:21] to make it happen take some I want the
[80:23] road have to give it we don't need a
[80:25] central Authority we don't need any more
[80:27] regulation than just me and whoever's
[80:29] building my road if someone's teaching
[80:31] my children what do you need from me to
[80:34] teach my children I'm happy to give it
[80:36] because again in a social capital World
[80:39] a Bitcoin Integrity world we all know
[80:42] that what you give you get right back
[80:46] because you can't manipulate that just
[80:48] like you can't manipulate Bitcoin you
[80:49] can't manipulate perfect social credit
[80:53] perfect social capital
[80:55] so that's an interesting question and it
[80:58] could go both ways no no under the
[81:00] certain current system no you will need
[81:03] Central Authority Under a pure Bitcoin
[81:05] standard and got it be beautiful to live
[81:07] to see that day Robin I hope to I'm eat
[81:09] healthy and
[81:11] exercise yes we could have no longer any
[81:13] Central Authority if we're under a
[81:15] Bitcoin standard under a social capital
[81:18] standard under an Integrity standard
[81:20] because then we're all just wanting
[81:22] what's best for one another and we're
[81:23] all willing to just give give give
[81:25] because we know it's just going to keep
[81:26] so much will come back that you'll have
[81:28] to give like you just said earlier when
[81:30] you said the Bitcoin standard works
[81:32] because people just get so abundant they
[81:35] have to go give it away here just take
[81:37] it sure I'll take a yacht in return sure
[81:39] I'll take this like you have to give
[81:42] under a system that's so abundant you
[81:44] have no other choice you have so much
[81:46] that's the Bitcoin standard you wouldn't
[81:47] need a central Authority because you
[81:48] wouldn't need people
[81:50] forcing people to they wouldn't you
[81:52] wouldn't need a a system forcing to take
[81:54] because people would just be giving so
[81:56] much it there' be so much opportunity
[81:58] it' almost be a new problem of like what
[82:01] do I do with all this abundance drivve
[82:02] me crazy so
[82:04] yes great problem to have yeah I want
[82:07] that problem I love it a lot we have too
[82:10] much abundance and I think we we get
[82:12] actually to this point uh I I have no
[82:14] clue how long it will take um I I I
[82:18] think it will be way sooner than we
[82:20] think because those wheels that are
[82:22] right now in motion are whe feeling very
[82:25] very quickly uh I feel like the Bitcoin
[82:28] adoption it's amazing how far we have
[82:31] come in just 15 years like 15 years is
[82:34] nothing and we already have Nations
[82:36] States buying Bitcoin on a daily basis
[82:39] like how crazy is that that's that's
[82:42] just like
[82:44] insane um thank you so much for taking
[82:47] your time so much for for being on and
[82:49] before I let you go where can people
[82:51] find you where can people ask you
[82:53] questions where can people uh see more
[82:55] about you well I tell you what Robin you
[82:57] said something earlier that was
[82:58] inspiring I've only ever made one
[83:01] YouTube video on this and it was
[83:02] basically my application to be on your
[83:06] program because I wanted to be on so bad
[83:09] so uh currently I am on Twitter with one
[83:12] video if you look me up it's just under
[83:15] my same name Derek M Kenny I've got one
[83:17] video on there if I find the energy and
[83:20] the time I'll I'll take Robin's uh
[83:22] orders and continue to build on that but
[83:24] I think more importantly I want to just
[83:28] encourage people to continue to support
[83:30] your channel and watch what you're doing
[83:33] and keep up with you that is more
[83:36] important to me I'm going to keep mostly
[83:38] prioritizing trying to get this whole
[83:40] husband father teacher thing down and I
[83:43] think people would be much better in
[83:45] your hands so anything that you want to
[83:47] direct towards me just keep giving it to
[83:50] Robin and he's way more worth your time
[83:52] so I just direct people right back back
[83:54] to you roben just keep watching what
[83:56] you're doing and that makes me happy
[83:58] that that's uh that's very kind of you
[84:01] thank you so much and also thank you for
[84:03] for taking time thank you for being here
[84:04] today thank you also for everyone that's
