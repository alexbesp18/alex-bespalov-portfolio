[00:00] just a matter of time before other
[00:02] companies really begin doing the micro
[00:04] strategy Playbook gold is a$ 20 trillion
[00:07] asset Bitcoin is currently about a $1
[00:08] trillion asset you have a very easy case
[00:11] to make that Bitcoin is at least digital
[00:13] gold it's probably a lot better than
[00:15] digital gold it's more scarce than gold
[00:17] it's more divisible than gold it's more
[00:18] portable than gold arguably more
[00:20] fungible than gold it's more verifiable
[00:22] than gold micro strategy has actually
[00:23] outperformed every company in the S&P
[00:25] 500 and it wasn't just luck like this is
[00:28] actually a strategy that anyone can
[00:30] employ and it works part of the reason
[00:32] why I think a lot of these bigger
[00:33] companies haven't done that is because
[00:35] these bigger companies aren't exactly
[00:37] like micro strategy like micro strategy
[00:39] was a very unique example and so I think
[00:40] other companies are going to come
[00:42] Michael Dell is one of the closest
[00:43] people to understanding Bitcoin if
[00:46] Humanity stores wealth and beachfront
[00:47] property we will create more beachfront
[00:49] property if Humanity stores a lot of
[00:51] wealth and gold we will create more gold
[00:53] and mine more gold and sell that gold in
[00:55] the market Bitcoin is the only monetary
[00:57] and financial asset that no matter how
[00:59] much wealth we store in Bitcoin we're
[01:01] not actually going to be able to create
[01:02] more than 21 million Bitcoin the best
[01:05] way to save for the future and a very
[01:07] long-term risk adjusted manner would be
[01:09] just buying Bitcoin putting it in cold
[01:11] storage and never touching it if you
[01:13] want to outperform bitcoin you need
[01:14] something that's going to appreciate or
[01:16] generate returns in excess of 50% per
[01:19] year and it needs to do so in like a
[01:21] risk adjusted manner obviously any
[01:23] investment that you're making that's
[01:24] going to give you 50% that's not Bitcoin
[01:27] on a long time Horizon there's going to
[01:28] be a lot of risk that to that if you
[01:30] hold your Bitcoin on an exchange or an
[01:32] ETF or a single Hardware wallet those
[01:35] are all single points of
[01:36] [Music]
[01:39] failure you put out a video about how
[01:42] Dell could be a huge company I think you
[01:44] even said like the largest company when
[01:46] they adopt the micro strategy strategy
[01:50] uh and you also cover uh micro strategy
[01:53] uh in in some videos before um is that
[01:57] do you think that that's actually could
[01:59] happen that like uh bigger companies
[02:01] bigger than micro strategy is are
[02:03] copying uh this this Playbook and
[02:06] actually getting to have an major
[02:09] advantage uh and what did you find out
[02:12] with with that and and why that specific
[02:14] example yeah I definitely think it can
[02:17] happen um and to to some extent I would
[02:20] say it's probably just a matter of of
[02:22] time before other companies really begin
[02:25] doing the micro strategy Playbook right
[02:28] like we have the the smaller example s
[02:30] like Selmer scientific um metap planet
[02:34] and maybe a few other private small
[02:36] companies that are effectively doing the
[02:39] exact same thing as as micro strategy
[02:41] like cathedra Bitcoin announced that
[02:43] they're trying to accumulate more
[02:45] Bitcoin per share like that's kind of
[02:46] their objective when running the the the
[02:50] the company Dell I think is an
[02:52] interesting example and it would
[02:54] obviously be if they went on a a full
[02:57] Bitcoin standard like micro strategy has
[03:00] it would be the the largest company to
[03:02] do so like you've had for example you've
[03:04] had Tesla buy Bitcoin you've had Square
[03:06] buy Bitcoin you've had I think coinbase
[03:08] probably even owns a little bit of
[03:09] Bitcoin or I hope they do um but none of
[03:14] those larger companies have like fully
[03:17] embraced a Bitcoin standard and focused
[03:20] exclusively on accumulating more Bitcoin
[03:22] per share for their
[03:24] shareholders um and and part of the
[03:26] reason why I think a lot of these bigger
[03:28] companies haven't done that is because
[03:31] these bigger companies aren't exactly
[03:33] like micro strategy like micro strategy
[03:35] was a very unique example where sailor
[03:37] was the the founder he was the CEO and
[03:40] now he's the chairman and he had I
[03:42] believe like a majority of the Voting
[03:44] Rights or or something that enabled him
[03:46] to
[03:47] basically move micro strategy in a very
[03:50] unique direction that other companies
[03:52] like have to go through a bunch of
[03:54] Executives and then they have to get
[03:56] their board of directors on board and
[03:57] there's a lot of different stakeholders
[03:59] that need to buy into this pretty you
[04:02] know crazy but new idea of of of Bitcoin
[04:07] and and accumulating more Bitcoin per
[04:09] share and so like he was able to to do
[04:11] that just because he was the you know
[04:13] the buck stopped with him like he was
[04:15] the final de decision maker whereas Dell
[04:18] is I haven't you know gone too deep into
[04:22] like how their corporation is structured
[04:24] and now their executives are structured
[04:25] and who has all the voting rights for
[04:26] the shares but I would imagine it's a
[04:28] little bit more dispersed uh the micro
[04:31] strategy which might be part of the
[04:33] reason why it's taking so long even if
[04:36] Michael Dell has been cryptically
[04:38] tweeting about Bitcoin here and there
[04:40] but I do think it's possible um and I
[04:43] think it it should happen it's it's it's
[04:45] probably just a matter of a time before
[04:47] you know people actually do buy into the
[04:50] the thesis that sailor is executing a a
[04:53] good strategy and they see the the past
[04:55] results and and and they understand that
[04:58] like hey micros strategy has actually
[05:00] outperformed every company in the S&P
[05:03] 500 um and it wasn't just luck like this
[05:06] is actually a a skill or not skill but a
[05:09] strategy that anyone can employ and it
[05:11] works and so I think other companies are
[05:13] going to come but I don't know if Dell
[05:16] is is for sure GNA be the next one I've
[05:17] made the video because I hope they are
[05:19] and I think Michael Dell is one of the
[05:22] closest people to understanding Bitcoin
[05:25] but uh I don't know timing or or if they
[05:28] will actually be the next Domino to fall
[05:30] it's also interesting the time that
[05:32] we're in because if you just track the
[05:35] past uh um price movements we are right
[05:38] before a a possible major Bull Run I
[05:42] mean we kind of had already a major Bull
[05:44] Run in the last 12 months we are up
[05:46] significantly um but uh everyone is like
[05:50] feeling not that big of a bull run that
[05:53] could have happened um so like the the
[05:56] October movement now and and the next 12
[05:59] 12 months could be TR tramatic would be
[06:02] interesting how also this would then
[06:05] pressure maybe or get some form into
[06:08] this companies where like okay maybe the
[06:11] one of of two decision makers that are
[06:13] on the verge maybe they find a quicker
[06:15] decision now or they have some more time
[06:18] pressure in the board meetings that they
[06:20] have and all of the sudden things move
[06:22] quicker when maybe this the Bitcoin
[06:25] price moves sideways the arguments are
[06:26] not there is that this is that formal
[06:29] level that we see in retail maybe also a
[06:32] factor in in in big companies and
[06:35] corporations or is is that uh not the
[06:37] reality yeah I mean I would imagine that
[06:39] like key Executives of large
[06:42] corporations would probably try to argue
[06:44] that like they're making very strategic
[06:46] calculated decisions but I think at the
[06:48] end of the day they are just individual
[06:50] people that are subject to the exact
[06:52] same emotions and fears as a normal
[06:55] retail investor and I think Bitcoin is
[06:58] so massively misunderstood by so many
[07:02] different people that the way almost
[07:04] virtually everyone at least initially
[07:06] learns about Bitcoin is via the number
[07:09] going up number go up technology the
[07:11] price is going up and when the price is
[07:14] going up that either forces them to like
[07:17] question their original assumptions
[07:19] because like maybe they had heard about
[07:20] Bitcoin years ago completely wrote it
[07:22] off like virtually everyone originally
[07:24] does and then they're like wait a second
[07:27] like I thought this died five years ago
[07:29] or three years ago or two years ago it's
[07:31] still alive and it's it's now at an
[07:33] all-time high like what is going on here
[07:35] and so it kind of forces you and
[07:37] everybody to question your original
[07:39] assumptions and then you're like okay
[07:41] like this thing you know you do some
[07:44] research and you're like wait a second
[07:45] like maybe I don't even really know what
[07:47] money is to begin with maybe like maybe
[07:50] Bitcoin is happens to be the best form
[07:52] of money or or a new form of money and
[07:54] so it's like the number go up is kind of
[07:56] the bitcoin's best marketing material I
[07:59] would say or marketing strategy and yeah
[08:01] I think when the Bull Run takes
[08:04] off you know I don't know when but I
[08:06] would I would expect soon as well um I
[08:09] think a lot of people will start
[08:10] questioning their original assumptions
[08:12] and wondering why they don't have a a
[08:14] larger allocation or why they're not
[08:16] maybe doing the the micro strategy
[08:19] strategy of you know putting almost all
[08:22] of your balance sheet in Bitcoin as it's
[08:24] the best way to preserve and grow
[08:26] Capital into the future on a long-term
[08:29] risk adjusted basis so yeah I think
[08:32] people will definitely fall for the uh
[08:35] number go up technology one thing that's
[08:37] kind of interesting thinking back to
[08:39] sailor is like he uh kind of joined or
[08:43] became a bitcoiner I guess um back in
[08:46] August of 2020 I believe was the
[08:48] specific month which was like right
[08:50] after the having we weren't really in a
[08:52] major Bull Run it's it's it's somewhat
[08:54] similar to where we are right now so it
[08:56] would be really awesome if there was
[08:57] like another sailor that popped up
[08:59] pretty soon um at like a large publicly
[09:01] traded company and maybe there will be I
[09:03] don't know but um it is kind of
[09:04] interesting how sailor timed it very
[09:07] well like in in in in retrospect right
[09:09] like he didn't time the the bare Market
[09:11] bottom in like 2018 or 2019 perfectly by
[09:14] any means but like he he got in right
[09:17] before the
[09:18] 202022 bull run and I think that was
[09:21] like you know critical probably for for
[09:24] some of his success and being able to
[09:25] weather bitcoin's extreme volatility
[09:27] because like a lot of people pretty much
[09:29] Buy in near the top and they have to
[09:32] watch their portfolio draw down 80% and
[09:35] if you pulled the Sailor strategy you
[09:37] know at the 2017 top or the 2021 top and
[09:40] that was when you were like I'm 100% all
[09:42] in on bitcoin and you then you're watch
[09:43] your entire portfolio fall 80% that
[09:46] would be pretty brutal and especially if
[09:48] you used leverage like sailor does you
[09:51] know to a small extent then you could
[09:53] get wiped out so like sailor timed the
[09:55] market uh pretty perfectly probably just
[09:59] chance um but it is kind of interesting
[10:02] to to think about like his timing and
[10:04] then what might be the timing of of you
[10:06] know the next major
[10:08] corporation yeah it's interesting the
[10:10] the era of 2020 the the the co 2020 era
[10:13] because I think a lot of people all of
[10:16] the sudden came to a a stop to like a
[10:20] lot of activities that they were doing
[10:23] all of a sudden were not possible
[10:24] anymore like going out uh with friends
[10:27] all of the sudden everything was
[10:28] cancelled uh maybe your work even
[10:30] stopped I imagine I was in a situation
[10:34] where I basically worked like 70 hours
[10:35] and then all of a sudden had zero hours
[10:38] for two weeks uh which was amazing for
[10:41] me uh as it was really cool and give me
[10:44] time to think and was also the starting
[10:46] point of of social media for me and I
[10:48] think that's what also a lot of people
[10:51] had um in 2020 where all of the sudden
[10:54] like oh what's going on and we have time
[10:56] and and and things that we previous
[10:58] thought are correct all of the sudden
[11:00] not correct anymore and uh I think 2020
[11:03] era was the one one OG that came out of
[11:06] that was was probably Michael saor the
[11:08] the biggest one from that uh and it
[11:10] would be interesting uh which one would
[11:12] be the biggest one coming out of like
[11:15] the 2024 having Bitcoin ETF kind of a
[11:19] time because it's also like the last
[11:21] just 12 months a lot of things happened
[11:23] in Bitcoin uh so I'm imagine like it
[11:27] would be really interesting if there is
[11:29] another Michael with Michael D coming
[11:32] out of of of that area really really
[11:34] cool yeah interesting thought also um to
[11:37] your report that you said uh that you
[11:40] also have in your Twitter bi also saying
[11:42] your wealth is melting by Bitcoin um I'm
[11:45] not aware of of of the report like let's
[11:47] go with like what did you write in there
[11:50] and and what can we we learn from that
[11:52] was what's kind of the the assumptions
[11:54] from yeah absolutely we can definitely
[11:56] go go over uh your wealth is melting so
[11:59] this was a report I published earlier
[12:02] this year and it was inspired by you
[12:04] know a number of of great Bitcoin
[12:06] writers and and thinkers and even you
[12:08] know prior like Austrian economists and
[12:11] and whatnot um the way I I I've always
[12:15] thought about Bitcoin is kind of uh
[12:17] maybe unique way like I've Loved Jeff
[12:20] Booth his thesis of like hyper
[12:24] technology deflation effectively like
[12:25] showing that humanity is becoming hyper
[12:29] hyper productive um currently and over
[12:32] the last 100 plus years like we learn to
[12:34] fly and then like 60 years later we
[12:36] landed on the moon and we've you know we
[12:39] storing data on like you know one
[12:42] megabyte massive hard drives many many
[12:45] years ago and now we can go on
[12:47] amazon.com and buy a three terabyte hard
[12:50] drive for like a couple hundred bucks
[12:53] and so it's like we are becoming
[12:55] incredibly incredibly efficient and I
[12:58] think a lot of people intuitively know
[13:00] this and they and they kind of feel it
[13:02] but then in consumer prices like in
[13:06] dollars or Euros or whatever currency
[13:08] you're you're using you still see the
[13:10] price of food going up you see the price
[13:12] of X going up y going up whatever all
[13:15] these basic consumer goods your rents
[13:17] going up you know that like Humanity
[13:19] with computers and technology and and
[13:21] all these Mass efficiencies we're
[13:23] becoming more productive but at the same
[13:26] time everything is getting more
[13:28] expensive which is just like kind of uh
[13:31] doesn't feel right per se and and Jeff
[13:34] Booth obviously talks about this idea of
[13:36] like well naturally what's happening is
[13:37] we're we actually are becoming more
[13:39] productive at this stuff and Technology
[13:41] deflation does exist and it should be
[13:43] making things and consumer items cheaper
[13:46] and the the concept and your wealth is
[13:48] melting is not just applying this to
[13:52] basic consumer goods but it applies this
[13:54] concept of technology deflation to all
[13:58] Financial as assets that humans hold
[14:00] today right and so like if you have a
[14:04] large large portion of your wealth in
[14:06] Gold well not only does technology
[14:09] deflation apply to building hard drives
[14:12] but it actually applies to Gold
[14:13] production as well where over the last
[14:16] 200 plus years think about how much more
[14:18] efficient and more productive we are at
[14:20] mining gold out of the ground like we're
[14:21] not going in rivers and like panning for
[14:24] for gold per se we're we're using
[14:26] heavyduty machines that are like digging
[14:29] massive holes into the ground and using
[14:31] a lot of energy maybe not even that many
[14:33] people um and we're extracting more and
[14:36] more gold per year and if you like if
[14:38] you go back and you assume that the
[14:40] supply of gold is growing at 2% per year
[14:44] every year ever since like you know
[14:46] thousands of years ago then we're
[14:48] actually producing more gold this year
[14:51] than all of the gold produced from like
[14:53] 2000 BC to like
[14:56] 18680 um and that's just because of even
[14:59] though it's it's 2% in in the supply
[15:02] growth it's still 2% that compounds
[15:04] every year and you can even see like
[15:06] historical estimates of of gold Supply
[15:08] growth charts it it looks parabolic if
[15:11] you zoom out on a long enough time
[15:12] Horizon because we're getting more and
[15:14] more productive at at you know mining
[15:16] gold and so this whole concept of your
[15:19] wealth is melting is this idea of like
[15:21] hey if humanity is storing 20 trillion
[15:24] dollar worth of wealth in this yellow
[15:27] rock called gold well that's a 20
[15:29] trillion bounty on uh being able to mine
[15:34] more gold and sell it to the market at
[15:37] you know the current market price and
[15:40] that doesn't just apply to Gold that
[15:42] applies to real estate if if humanity is
[15:44] is holding 300 or $200 trillion dollars
[15:46] worth of wealth in real estate well
[15:48] that's a massive incentive to go out
[15:50] there and build more houses or build
[15:52] more apartment buildings or even create
[15:53] more land like B the city of Boston is
[15:56] we've created more land in the city of
[15:58] Boston and Dubai there's a there's a an
[16:01] artificial island off the coast of Dubai
[16:03] called Palm jera which homes like
[16:06] thousands and thousands of residents
[16:09] that was created you know in the middle
[16:11] of the ocean um so like we are able to
[16:14] if if Humanity stores wealth and
[16:16] beachfront property we will create more
[16:18] Beach beachfront property and we have if
[16:20] Humanity stores a lot of wealth and gold
[16:22] we will create more gold and and and and
[16:25] you know mine more gold and and sell
[16:27] that gold in the market and and extra ex
[16:29] ract value from people that hold wealth
[16:30] in Gold Bitcoin is the only monetary and
[16:34] financial asset that no matter how much
[16:36] wealth we store in Bitcoin we're not
[16:38] actually going to be able to create more
[16:40] than 21 million Bitcoin no matter how
[16:42] much time energy resources or how much
[16:45] more productive Humanity gets that is
[16:47] going to be a fixed Supply that can
[16:49] never be increased um forever and so
[16:53] that's completely different from every
[16:54] other financial asset and I think part
[16:56] of you know a problem that we've had is
[16:58] like
[16:59] we've become so productive over the last
[17:01] 200 plus years we have no idea where to
[17:04] actually store this wealth like we're
[17:05] storing it gold we're storing in real
[17:07] estate we're storing it in large cap us
[17:09] Equity markets we don't know and so we
[17:11] create this like massive Diversified
[17:13] portfolio of everything because we have
[17:15] no idea like where to actually put all
[17:17] this wealth that we've generated with
[17:19] technology and eight billion people
[17:21] being connected you know with a phone or
[17:23] with a computer like this and so this
[17:26] this idea of all this wealth that we
[17:28] store outside of Bitcoin is slowly
[17:31] melting away even if it's at a very slow
[17:33] slow rate it's still melting as we can
[17:35] produce more of this stuff Bitcoin is
[17:37] this one monetary tool that we can't
[17:40] create more of and it's very different
[17:42] from everything
[17:43] else it's it's gold the the main
[17:46] competitor of of of Bitcoin is like gold
[17:49] the the thing that we we kind of have to
[17:51] beat in in terms of narrative of store
[17:54] value I think it's one of the first ones
[17:56] but I I I think it's it it really
[17:59] applies to um any any financial asset
[18:02] that humans are are actively storing
[18:05] wealth in it can be gold it can be real
[18:07] estate it can be bonds it can be
[18:10] equities it can be stocks right like if
[18:13] the world holds uh three trillion
[18:15] dollars worth of wealth in Nvidia that's
[18:17] a massive bounty on being able to design
[18:20] and manufacture gpus in a more efficient
[18:23] manner or build a better GPU or build AI
[18:25] sof or build software that maybe makes
[18:28] one GPU like a thousand times more
[18:30] efficient and so it's like all any it's
[18:34] it's all like one big pull in my mind of
[18:36] like wealth and if you store wealth in
[18:39] certain things and PE that's going to
[18:41] you know incentivize people to produce
[18:43] more of those things and Bitcoin is just
[18:45] this one thing that that we can't
[18:47] produce more of and so yeah I think
[18:48] Gold's like obviously one of the the the
[18:50] main ones but I still think like in the
[18:52] grand scheme of the entire Global
[18:54] Financial system Bitcoin and gold are
[18:57] still very very small so probably like
[19:00] in the short to medium term which might
[19:01] be like the next 10 plus years um
[19:04] they're both probably going to do very
[19:06] well especially in in dollar
[19:08] terms yeah I definitely think so too
[19:12] would be interesting also to to to see I
[19:14] think one of the huge markets wasn't the
[19:17] real estate market the the biggest one I
[19:19] think Jesse Meer Myers put some some
[19:22] interesting chart out that is also
[19:24] Michael saor using a lot I think real
[19:26] estate was the biggest one from there if
[19:28] I'm not mistaken uh and it's interesting
[19:31] because uh I don't know if it's also in
[19:33] America so but in Austria people
[19:36] actually use real estate as a personal
[19:38] savings account which is pretty
[19:40] hilarious because for me real estate is
[19:43] is either a home or a business uh
[19:47] depending on how you look at it but it
[19:48] it's never savings it should should not
[19:51] be a savings device it's just like like
[19:54] if you buy a camera or if you buy a
[19:57] computer it's also not a savings device
[19:59] and so should not be a home why do you
[20:02] think is it's realate right now and
[20:04] still such a huge market and so um uh
[20:07] such a an interesting um asset where
[20:10] people store the wealth in and how do
[20:13] you envision that changing over time
[20:16] towards Bitcoin maybe also with like
[20:18] Bitcoin being maybe collateral in in the
[20:20] future where we borrow against our our
[20:23] Bitcoin is is that something that you're
[20:25] looking
[20:26] at yeah it's a it's a great question
[20:29] um I guess two things on Why Real Estate
[20:32] One Is Real Estate is a a a semi scarce
[20:36] asset like kind of looking at the entire
[20:39] landscape of financial assets real
[20:42] estate is it's it's it's more scarce
[20:44] than food it's more scarce than water
[20:45] bottles it's more scarce than like basic
[20:47] consumer goods cars whatever um and so
[20:50] that makes it somewhat good at storing
[20:52] value it's obviously more scarce than
[20:53] dollars like if you think about what
[20:55] even is a dollar or traditional fiat
[20:57] currency dollar specifically it's a unit
[21:00] of account that's tied to a basket of
[21:02] consumer goods right and these consumer
[21:04] goods were being able to produce more
[21:06] and more per year and the dollar is
[21:08] designed to lose 2% every year at least
[21:11] against the basket consumer goods so if
[21:13] we're able to produce more and more of
[21:15] this basket of consumer goods in a more
[21:16] productive manner then you know the
[21:19] dollar is going to lose value against
[21:20] that and obviously houses and actual
[21:23] land and real estate are a lot more
[21:26] scarce than these basic consumer Goods
[21:28] which the dollar is designed to lose
[21:30] value against so obviously real estate
[21:33] is going to gain value against the
[21:35] dollar over time because it's harder to
[21:38] build a house and and a new piece of
[21:40] land than it is to manufacture a water
[21:43] bottle and ship it to you know another
[21:45] city and so real estate is semis scarce
[21:48] it's more scarce than the dollar so
[21:50] obviously people are going to you know
[21:53] use real estate as a store of value
[21:56] unless there's something better which I
[21:57] obviously I think is Bitcoin but just no
[21:59] one really recognizes that and two the
[22:01] second reason why I think a lot of
[22:02] people store wealth in real estate is
[22:04] because you can access very cheap
[22:06] leverage with real estate right like a
[22:08] lot of people don't think about it this
[22:09] way but when you at least in the United
[22:11] States when you buy a house typically
[22:14] what you'll do is take out a 30-year
[22:16] fixed rate mortgage which enables you to
[22:18] put 20% down or 10% down and effectively
[22:22] that enables you to go 5x or 10x long us
[22:25] real estate and obviously like I
[22:28] mentioned real estate is a lot more
[22:30] scarce than basic consumer goods the
[22:32] dollar is designed to lose value against
[22:34] basic consumer goods and so obviously
[22:36] the dollar is going to lose value
[22:38] against something that's more scarce
[22:40] than basic consumer goods which is real
[22:42] estate and so if real estate is going to
[22:44] go up against the dollar then you want
[22:46] to actually go leverage long real estate
[22:48] to to some extent because you can
[22:50] generate a lot of wealth that way um and
[22:54] that's what people do right like so you
[22:55] can buy a bunch of real estate with
[22:57] money that's not yours
[22:59] you can borrow the money at a fixed rate
[23:00] for 30 years and you know that the
[23:02] dollar is going to lose a lot of value
[23:04] over the next 30 Years and you know that
[23:06] the interest rate can't increase at
[23:08] least in the United States if you B
[23:09] borrow out a fixed rate mortgage and
[23:11] then even if rates go down then you can
[23:14] refinance your your mortgage and borrow
[23:18] the money at a at a lower interest rate
[23:21] and and and then that enables you to
[23:22] save more money and and and kind of get
[23:25] more leverage at a cheaper price so the
[23:27] those are kind of like the two reasons
[23:29] why why people have have used real
[23:31] estate to to store value and I think
[23:34] it's it's it's it would continue
[23:36] happening until there was a superior
[23:39] alternative um which obviously I think
[23:41] is Bitcoin I think you'll be able to
[23:42] save Bitcoin uh in a superior long-term
[23:45] risk adjusted manner you won't have to
[23:47] take out leverage against your Bitcoin
[23:49] unless you really want to um but I think
[23:52] that's kind of how it's going to
[23:54] continue playing out I think Bitcoin is
[23:57] good collateral and it's going to be
[23:59] very interesting to see how like the
[24:00] Bitcoin collateralized loan Market plays
[24:02] out um like unchain is a Pioneer in that
[24:05] for commercial lending for businesses
[24:07] where you can deposit your Bitcoin as
[24:09] collateral uh buy borrow dollars um and
[24:13] then buy other assets or buy more
[24:16] Bitcoin potentially you know whatever
[24:17] the business would want to do um but
[24:20] it's still a pretty small Market um in
[24:21] the grand scheme of like all lending uh
[24:25] loan markets and and the entire banking
[24:27] system but I do think over time it's
[24:29] probably a a massive Market that will
[24:32] eventually be tapped by you know
[24:34] Unchained and Banks and a bunch of other
[24:37] entities yeah it seems like a a no prer
[24:41] if if you have get the Bitcoin you
[24:43] borrow against to get US Dollars uh and
[24:46] take the long-term approach there's like
[24:48] this amazing chart that I'm obsessed
[24:50] with this week uh where you see the
[24:53] Bitcoin price but in a 4year moving
[24:56] average so like the Bitcoin price is
[24:58] basically just like a straight line up
[25:00] it there's like some waves to it but it
[25:02] it looks like a a hill upwards and not
[25:05] those crazy uh volatility in there and
[25:08] if you look at that then you're like
[25:10] okay yeah like let's let's take some
[25:12] four five six year uh borrowing time uh
[25:16] against the Bitcoin and then I can just
[25:19] like refinance the the the the loan in
[25:23] in like five years then the US dollar
[25:26] definitely will have lost value and my
[25:28] Bitcoin definitely have like with 99% uh
[25:32] certainty have uh gain value uh and then
[25:35] you can easily repay that so it's it's
[25:38] an interesting strategy and I often
[25:42] probably because of Celsius and other uh
[25:44] instances it's not bigger than it is now
[25:47] I feel like this scared a lot of
[25:50] people made a bad R about it but we will
[25:54] probably get back to that and uh as as
[25:57] bigger players also come in I guess also
[26:00] normal big Banks uh I Envision coming
[26:02] into the scene like this will not only
[26:04] be a Bitcoin companies thing I think
[26:06] really big Banks uh will it will
[26:09] probably only be a time only a question
[26:12] of time they they come in do do you also
[26:14] see it like that that big Banks JB
[26:15] Morgan maybe even that would be funny
[26:18] they come in and say yeah borrow your
[26:20] Bitcoin against
[26:22] it yeah and like sailor has talked about
[26:25] uh this a little bit recently too I mean
[26:27] I I I think that's probably inevitable
[26:31] um it's going to happen it's just a
[26:32] matter of time um but it's going to be
[26:36] interesting to see how it plays out
[26:37] because you know we don't know exactly
[26:38] what services large Banks would end up
[26:41] offering when it comes to to bitcoin
[26:43] whether it's um you know borrowing
[26:46] against your Bitcoin or or or like yield
[26:48] on your Bitcoin and like what that would
[26:50] even mean obviously a lot of people were
[26:53] highly burned by FTX block fine Celsius
[26:56] and I'm extremely extremely skeptical
[26:59] maybe perpetually forever skeptical of
[27:01] any sort of Bitcoin yield product no
[27:03] matter who that would be coming from um
[27:05] because at the end of the day I feel
[27:07] like if you are taking uh earning yield
[27:10] on your Bitcoin you are taking risk um
[27:14] it's not like the dollar system where
[27:15] when you deposit dollars into JP Morgan
[27:19] um they can't you know put those dollars
[27:22] uh into into a t- bill which is
[27:25] basically the government and they're
[27:26] never the government is never going to
[27:27] us government is never going to default
[27:30] if they if they are on the cusp of
[27:32] default they can literally print the
[27:33] money and give you your yield whereas um
[27:36] and so you don't really have to worry
[27:37] about that when it comes to depositing
[27:39] dollars but with Bitcoin is a completely
[27:41] different story right because if
[27:43] someone's lending out your Bitcoin
[27:45] there's no lender of Last Resort for
[27:47] Bitcoin um if if JP Morgan or Celsius or
[27:51] FTX lends out your bit Bitcoin to a
[27:54] counterparty and the counterparty loses
[27:56] the Bitcoin and JP Morgan becomes
[27:58] insolvent or FTX becomes insolvent then
[28:01] obviously you're probably going to lose
[28:02] a big chunk of your Bitcoin if not all
[28:04] of it um so I think that that it's it's
[28:08] very uh important to be highly skeptical
[28:11] of any sort of Bitcoin yield product
[28:13] forever probably and um you know we
[28:17] we'll see how it ends up playing out
[28:18] over the next you know couple decades
[28:20] but yeah I think Bitcoin is collateral
[28:23] will will continue to be a massive uh
[28:25] growing Market or or become a lot more
[28:27] massive massive in the future I think
[28:29] like you can look at stocks uh in like
[28:33] uh you know your typical brokerage
[28:34] account as a part of that like if you go
[28:36] to interactive brokers in the United
[28:38] States you can borrow against your your
[28:41] stocks at basically like fed funds or
[28:44] Liber plus like 50 basis points which is
[28:47] basically like some of the cheapest
[28:49] interest rates that you can get on any
[28:51] asset in the world I think that
[28:53] eventually that same concept is probably
[28:56] going to come to bitcoin obviously
[28:58] whenever you borrow against Bitcoin it's
[29:00] you know highly important especially in
[29:03] this manner it's highly important to do
[29:04] so in a very very conservative way like
[29:07] in a perfect world you know it'd be cool
[29:09] to take out a 30 30-year fix rate
[29:11] mortgage and buy Bitcoin because you
[29:13] know your house they don't Mark to
[29:15] Market your house if it starts to fall
[29:17] in value whereas if you borrow against
[29:18] your Bitcoin they are marked to you are
[29:21] marked to marketing like the value of
[29:22] your Bitcoin so you might get a margin
[29:24] call but obviously with a 30-year
[29:25] mortgage as long as you keep making your
[29:27] payment doesn't matter if the house the
[29:30] price of your house Falls you know
[29:32] they're not going to be like post more
[29:34] collateral like it is what it is um
[29:37] whereas when you borrow against Bitcoin
[29:39] um you know they might be like hey post
[29:41] more post more Bitcoin is collateral
[29:43] because the price of Bitcoin just clap
[29:44] so you have to be very conservative but
[29:46] yeah I mean I think it's going to be a
[29:47] growing market and in the long run
[29:49] obviously if Bitcoin continues
[29:50] functioning it's going to keep going up
[29:53] um and it's probably going to be a
[29:54] pretty good trade for a number of people
[29:56] like it has been
[29:58] did you see the discussion between
[30:00] Michael S and Saina Mo where they talked
[30:03] about a risk-free rate unfortunately
[30:06] just saw the the clip I didn't came to
[30:08] see the whole podcast so I didn't didn't
[30:10] have the context but did you see see
[30:12] that and uh how was that how is that
[30:16] coming that Michael C talks about
[30:18] risk-free yield I remember him talking
[30:20] about cels was in a bad way in one way
[30:23] he's like why that why take the chances
[30:26] 5% more yield and it seems like he
[30:29] changed his opinion but I did not see
[30:30] the whole thing yeah I saw that too um
[30:34] yeah it's a it's a super first I think
[30:37] the the discussion that safine and
[30:39] sailor had is very good for the
[30:41] community it's important to be uh
[30:43] disagreeing on things and having uh you
[30:46] know good arguments on on both sides I I
[30:50] listen to it like once and then I I try
[30:53] to go back and listen to it again uh to
[30:56] to really understand I haven't fully um
[30:59] grasp exactly what sailor is saying like
[31:02] one if sailor is saying
[31:04] that JP you'll be able to deposit you
[31:07] know $100 million worth of bitcoin and
[31:09] JP Morgan and someone is going to be
[31:12] willing to borrow that Bitcoin or say
[31:14] say you deposit 100 Bitcoin at JP Morgan
[31:17] and someone's willing to borrow 100
[31:19] Bitcoin and they like literally take the
[31:20] Bitcoin off the platform off JP Morgan
[31:22] and do something with the Bitcoin and
[31:24] they bring back a year from now 105
[31:27] Bitcoin and and then they JP Morgan pays
[31:29] you 104 Bitcoin um like maybe that will
[31:33] exist but I'm highly skeptical of like
[31:35] how big that market would be because I
[31:37] don't really know like who actually in
[31:40] today's world wants to borrow Bitcoin as
[31:42] long as the dollar still exist like
[31:44] there's a few Niche applications maybe
[31:46] for that like if you're a market maker
[31:49] and you have a a unique uh algorithm
[31:52] that enables you to basically generate a
[31:55] small small yield off your Bitcoin by
[31:57] just like arbitraging exchanges or or
[31:59] something along those lines maybe but I
[32:01] don't see like how big the market is for
[32:04] that and then maybe like people want to
[32:06] borrow Bitcoin because they want a short
[32:08] Bitcoin but I still also I don't even
[32:10] think that Market's really big either
[32:12] and so I'm a little skeptical of like
[32:14] how big the borrowing Bitcoin Market
[32:17] would be today if sailor is talking
[32:19] about like another way where it's like
[32:21] you deposit Bitcoin at JP Morgan and
[32:24] then JP Morgan like borrows against your
[32:27] Bitcoin keep your Bitcoin at JP Morgan
[32:30] and they like buy T bills with it and
[32:32] then they they earn 5% in dollar terms
[32:35] and then pay you some of that off your
[32:36] Bitcoin maybe he's talking about like
[32:39] that but I don't really know I I haven't
[32:41] fully grasped exactly what he's talking
[32:42] about and I hope that like other people
[32:44] start talking about this and and we can
[32:46] like learn you know how Bitcoin and
[32:49] banking might actually work 10 years
[32:51] from now or 20 years from now because it
[32:53] is kind of interesting to to how to see
[32:56] how that will actually play out and and
[32:58] you know you know what what type of
[33:00] services would JP Morgan actually be
[33:03] willing to offer um I think it's
[33:05] interesting yeah that's that's super
[33:08] interesting yeah it's also the question
[33:10] of like what financial services do we
[33:13] even need in like a hyper bitcon ised
[33:16] world like do do we need yield on our
[33:20] money if our money is appreciating and
[33:24] uh that that's the yield like that the
[33:27] appreciating your money and the uh
[33:29] increase in the purchasing power that's
[33:31] kind of the yield yep exactly and and
[33:33] that's like why most like like the the
[33:36] feuture is basically self self- custody
[33:38] or or like collaborative custody because
[33:41] you actually like yes you can you know
[33:43] take riskier bets like you can invest in
[33:45] stocks you can lend out your Bitcoin you
[33:47] can do a Bitcoin Bank whatever the heck
[33:49] that actually means to whoever is
[33:51] talking about that um but at the end of
[33:53] the day like if Bitcoin is just good
[33:56] money and like Parker Lewis has written
[33:58] about like the great def
[33:59] financialization which is kind of what
[34:01] hyperbitcoinization
[34:02] could be then the best way to save for
[34:06] the future uh in a in a very long-term
[34:09] risk adjusted manner would be just
[34:11] buying Bitcoin putting it in cold
[34:14] storage and never touching it like that
[34:16] would be the best way to to to save for
[34:18] the future because natural technology
[34:20] deflation is going to make things
[34:22] cheaper like the the yield that You' be
[34:24] getting on your Bitcoin is just the free
[34:26] market lowering price for you forever in
[34:30] perpetuity and you never have to take
[34:32] any real risk you don't actually get you
[34:34] know 1% on your Bitcoin it's just like
[34:36] the price of the things that you're
[34:38] buying are actually just falling year
[34:40] after year and you just hold Bitcoin but
[34:43] maybe there will but like maybe people
[34:44] will try to come up with the next
[34:46] blockfi and the next Celsius and maybe a
[34:48] wave of people will fall for that again
[34:50] and maybe it's and not you know maybe
[34:52] it's JP Morgan That's claiming to do
[34:54] this and it's a little sketchy but at
[34:56] the end of the day it's probably on a
[34:58] very long time Horizon the best way to
[35:01] hold wealth for the future is to
[35:03] actually not trust any counterparty take
[35:05] possession of the Bitcoin yourself and
[35:07] you know like unchain is one of the best
[35:09] ways to do that if you watch or listen
[35:11] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll
[35:13] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[35:16] and now the most important step is to
[35:19] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[35:22] hardware wallet my personal
[35:23] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[35:25] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[35:28] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[35:30] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[35:33] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[35:37] with the code Robin at the checkout
[35:39] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[35:43] your bitbox and the next step is to
[35:45] really level up your sovereignty as an
[35:48] individual you have to have the most
[35:50] secure self custody setup you have to
[35:53] secure your own devices you have to
[35:55] protect your privacy you you have to set
[35:58] up an inheritance plan and depending on
[36:01] where you live you even want to have a
[36:03] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[36:06] in case something goes really really
[36:08] wrong and through all those steps the
[36:10] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[36:13] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[36:15] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[36:19] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[36:22] how you can level up your sovereignty
[36:25] and last but not least I have something
[36:27] complet completely new for you guys I
[36:30] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[36:33] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[36:36] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[36:39] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[36:41] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[36:45] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[36:48] go out there and show that you are a
[36:50] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[36:53] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[36:56] dropped a completely new and amazing
[36:58] Genesis edition of their watch
[37:01] collections you have the date of the
[37:03] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[37:07] and of course also the block height and
[37:09] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[37:13] the level of detail they put in in this
[37:16] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[37:18] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces

[37:33] nice looking product out there which is
[37:35] like oh yeah like put your Bitcoin there
[37:38] and you get like a yield on on your
[37:41] Bitcoin for 5% I think a lot of people
[37:43] would do that because they trust that
[37:45] name and trust that Federal Reserve
[37:47] System uh and obviously hardcore Bitcoin
[37:51] is like I would not do this I mean I'm
[37:52] not in America anyways but uh I hardcore
[37:55] bitcoiners would probably not do that
[37:57] but a lot of other bitcoiners that are
[37:59] not that hardcore maybe are just like a
[38:01] few perc in they were like let's let's
[38:03] do it with JP Mor they are safe BS that
[38:05] would be would be an interesting uh
[38:08] thing if JB Morgan actually does
[38:10] something like that um but yeah it's
[38:12] it's for me it's confusing why Michael C
[38:15] is talking about that because I remember
[38:17] before even Celsius collapsed I remember
[38:20] seeing videos of him or interviews with
[38:22] him where he was asked okay is is Sal
[38:26] something good and he always answer with
[38:28] the same thing as like why add any risk
[38:31] to your Bitcoin for like 5% more and he
[38:34] always brought up up that example like
[38:36] you you make such huge gains with just
[38:38] having Bitcoin why have a little bit
[38:41] more profits for uh an enormous more
[38:46] amount of of risk and that that seems to
[38:48] be exactly the same thing now it's just
[38:50] JP Mo instead of Celsius I mean JB morg
[38:53] is probably more trust is way more trust
[38:55] moving than Celsius uh because CIO got
[38:58] bought it's interesting I just was uh
[39:01] thinking about that but yeah uh a couple
[39:05] oh one one other thought that I had it's
[39:07] like it's also like I mean it's
[39:08] interesting to think about the concept
[39:11] of outperforming Bitcoin in general
[39:13] because that's kind of what these
[39:14] entities are saying that they're able to
[39:15] do is like I'm able to take one Bitcoin
[39:18] and turn it into 1.05 Bitcoin and I'm
[39:21] able to do it in a risk-free way um and
[39:25] and you can deposit your you can with
[39:27] draw your Bitcoin from us whenever you
[39:29] want to so it's like a liquid uh
[39:31] investment that supposedly outperforms
[39:32] Bitcoin and I'm just highly highly
[39:34] skeptical of that and but it's
[39:36] interesting to think about right like
[39:37] looking back at the Celsius and the
[39:39] block f i i i would look at it and be
[39:42] like how would it be possible for you
[39:45] deposit Bitcoin into blockfi and earn 6%
[39:48] interest like even if like like
[39:51] obviously I knew it was you know not
[39:53] going to work like there something was
[39:54] wrong with it but it was like internally
[39:56] like how are how do they think that
[39:58] they're actually able to do this and
[40:00] like one of the one of the things that
[40:01] that uh you know people had talked about
[40:03] was like the gbtc trade which was like a
[40:06] kind of an Arbitrage opportunity that
[40:08] existed for a very long time and then it
[40:10] didn't exist and then that's part of the
[40:12] reason why blocki went under where like
[40:13] gbtc would always trade it a premium and
[40:16] so basically people would send Bitcoin
[40:19] to grayscale and then they would receive
[40:21] six months later gbtc shares and then
[40:25] they would sell the shares at a premium
[40:27] premium to to what they just deposited
[40:29] the Bitcoin in and then they would earn
[40:31] like a Bitcoin yield of course that
[40:33] works until gbtc starts trading at a
[40:36] discount exactly like it did you know I
[40:38] think at the end of 2021 early
[40:41] 2022 and then all of a sudden you know
[40:43] that trade completely blew up it was not
[40:45] a Bitcoin yield generator it was like a
[40:47] a Bitcoin loss generator and people had
[40:49] a lot of Bitcoin stuck in that trade and
[40:51] that's part of the reason why I block F
[40:53] went under and then like Celsius like
[40:55] you hear stories of of Celsius is like
[40:57] they were trying to generate Bitcoin
[40:59] yield by like buying Miners and Mining
[41:02] sites which is like you know yes it's
[41:05] possible to outperform bitcoin that way
[41:07] but to say it's like a almost a a a zero
[41:10] risk strategy to do that is just like
[41:13] completely wrong and completely
[41:15] irresponsible so like even if JP Morgan
[41:18] one day says hey we're able to pay you
[41:20] 5% on your Bitcoin I would be very
[41:23] curious to see like what their strategy
[41:24] is and like why it exists in the market
[41:27] but I would be highly skeptical that it
[41:29] works unless it's like a very unique
[41:31] thing with the dollar system that you
[41:33] know I I can't fully comprehend right
[41:35] now um but I would be highly skeptical
[41:37] of anyone that says they're able to give
[41:40] you risk-free yield on your
[41:43] Bitcoin I I see the the hardcore Bitcoin
[41:45] are sitting now and saying like oh yeah
[41:47] they they they will give you a yield so
[41:49] they can custody your Bitcoin and then
[41:52] get more Bitcoin on the on the banking
[41:54] sides but this whole thing is posing a
[41:57] really interesting question what does
[42:00] happen to companies the investment World
[42:02] The Venture Capital world and all that
[42:05] world when all of the sudden you have a
[42:07] hurdle rate of Bitcoin like it's it's
[42:10] easy for an venture capitalist to invest
[42:14] in a bunch of startups and one might go
[42:17] up because he has to get rid of his
[42:19] money anyways he has to get rid of his
[42:21] US Dollars anyways because they will
[42:23] completely debase anyways every investor
[42:25] knows that and and they are just taking
[42:28] a betat on on on small startups what
[42:30] does that do when uh an successful
[42:33] investor doesn't have to invest in in in
[42:37] companies because his money is actually
[42:39] growing over time and he can live a a
[42:43] more comfortable life and a more
[42:46] Stressless life with just staying in
[42:48] Bitcoin and doing his own things like
[42:51] what does that do yeah this is probably
[42:53] like one of the most interesting
[42:55] questions I would say in economics right
[42:57] right now and probably almost no one is
[43:00] talking about it the way I've thought
[43:02] about it is is yes what's going to
[43:05] happen is effectively the the hurdle
[43:07] rate for a viable investment will go up
[43:11] massively and it already kind of has
[43:13] like if you're evaluating your
[43:16] investment decisions in Bitcoin terms
[43:19] like I would say Michael sailor is then
[43:22] you effectively come to the conclusion
[43:23] that you need to outperform Bitcoin
[43:25] today not just in this theoretical post
[43:27] hyperbitcoinization world that we're
[43:29] also talking about um and so today it's
[43:32] like if you want to outperform bitcoin
[43:35] you you need to find something that's
[43:36] going to generate and and we can think
[43:38] in dollar terms just to make it simple
[43:40] for people like you need something
[43:41] that's going to appreciate or generate
[43:44] returns in excess of 50% per year if you
[43:47] think over the next few years bitcoin's
[43:49] gonna have a compound anual growth rate
[43:50] of 50% or so and it needs to do so in
[43:54] like a risk adjusted manner obviously
[43:56] any investment that you're making that's
[43:58] going to give you 50% that's not Bitcoin
[44:01] um on a long time Horizon there's going
[44:03] to be a lot of risk to that it might be
[44:05] like VC type Investments it might be
[44:07] like highly leveraged private Equity
[44:09] type Investments it's going to be things
[44:11] that are actually pretty risky and so
[44:14] it's like yes maybe you can find like
[44:16] something that would outperform 50%
[44:18] compound annual growth rate like you
[44:20] could bet on a sports game and like if
[44:22] you hit the right number um then yeah
[44:24] you could double your money overnight
[44:26] but it's like on a risk adjusted basis
[44:28] obviously the best bet is to hold
[44:30] Bitcoin and not to gamble your money on
[44:32] on Sports um and so that's kind of like
[44:35] the entire investment world will will
[44:37] basically be like sports gambling versus
[44:39] just holding Bitcoin which would be like
[44:41] the safest long-term bet that you could
[44:42] possibly make so I I think it completely
[44:45] changes everything I guess like the way
[44:47] that I've thought that it might
[44:49] potentially play out is like when you
[44:51] hold Bitcoin you're effectively like
[44:57] and you're just holding this like
[44:58] digital rock that like takes no res
[45:00] resources from everything and so like to
[45:03] to think about it like in another way is
[45:06] like if the entire world put all of
[45:07] their wealth in Bitcoin now all of the
[45:10] sudden everything people factories
[45:13] businesses are are basically free like
[45:16] or they're close to to zero price and so
[45:18] now all the people that hold the Bitcoin
[45:20] can effectively be like okay well if
[45:23] your you know time is is close to free
[45:26] or like you have no like or this Factory
[45:28] is is a very cheap price maybe the
[45:31] valuation of a company is very very low
[45:33] maybe at that point it makes sense to
[45:35] buy into the company like I I've used
[45:37] the example before of like if I could
[45:39] buy Apple the company for 0.1 Bitcoin I
[45:43] would I would buy that today like I I
[45:46] you know because I know over the next
[45:47] year Apple's probably going to spend me
[45:49] off thousands and thousands of Bitcoins
[45:51] in dividends I'm just I'm not saying
[45:54] Apple's worthless today I'm just saying
[45:55] that like the Valu for Apple needs to
[45:58] come way way way down before I even
[46:00] consider investing in apple and so
[46:02] that's probably what's what's eventually
[46:04] going to happen is just all of these uh
[46:07] resources companies outside in the
[46:10] outside world the valuations just come
[46:13] down very very massively and a lot of
[46:16] the wealth like a typical typical
[46:18] portfolio probably is just a ton of
[46:20] Bitcoin and maybe like a a few
[46:23] speculative bets that people are making
[46:24] because they they think they may see
[46:26] like Alpha in apple or their own
[46:29] business that they want to start or
[46:31] building a you know some sort of house
[46:33] that they want to build or or an
[46:34] apartment building that they think they
[46:36] have some sort of Edge on but I think a
[46:38] lot of the world's wealth will
[46:39] eventually just end up in Bitcoin and
[46:41] Cold
[46:43] Storage I think so too and I hope so too
[46:45] really really cool and how do you think
[46:49] then uh if we have that discussion now
[46:51] with with Bitcoin and and kind of hyper
[46:53] Bitcoin ased world how will Bitcoin
[46:56] change our perspective on uh being rich
[47:00] and and being wealthy I feel like there
[47:02] there could be a lot of changes there
[47:04] yeah it's well one I would say like it
[47:06] will massively like lower your time
[47:09] preference where like I think a lot of
[47:11] people think about wealth today and they
[47:12] think about you know a big house a nice
[47:14] car uh you know things like that
[47:17] vacations uh you know watches or or
[47:20] whatever whereas Bitcoin is like maybe
[47:23] you save enough Bitcoin to where you
[47:26] don't work against or you or you do work
[47:28] but you do meaningful work to you and
[47:32] you think very very long long term um
[47:35] and it's also just like people like
[47:38] wealthy people won't just be able to
[47:41] perpetually like grow like grow their
[47:44] wealth in like a nominal adjusted basis
[47:46] for example like in today's world I you
[47:48] could kind of argue especially like in
[47:50] the US we kind of have socialism for the
[47:52] rich where like if you own a bunch of
[47:53] real estate or you own a bunch of uh 500
[47:57] stocks or or private Equity companies or
[48:00] whatever those you know those assets go
[48:02] up over time they generate a yield and
[48:03] they go up over time um and and so like
[48:06] if you hold $100 million in the s&p500
[48:08] maybe you make $2 million a year in
[48:11] dividends or $1 million a year in
[48:13] dividends and then the actual S&P 500
[48:16] goes up you know $7 million a year six5
[48:19] million a year off of your 100 million
[48:21] that you have and so like you can kind
[48:23] of like literally live forever kind of
[48:25] RIT seeking um because whenever things
[48:28] go bad the government steps in bails out
[48:30] companies the fed you know lowers
[48:32] interest rates does QE keeps the market
[48:34] going up up and up forever and you get
[48:36] your dividend every year and you you
[48:38] know your assets keep going up in dollar
[48:40] terms Bitcoin on the other hand if there
[48:42] is no way to like extract rent from the
[48:46] rest of the world and like there's no
[48:47] lender of Last Resort and governments
[48:49] aren't just going to perpetually print
[48:51] Bitcoins because they can't to prop up
[48:53] all of your assets then the only way to
[48:55] like get value from society or like
[48:59] consume from your Bitcoins is to like
[49:01] sell your Bitcoins and and and spend it
[49:03] so you can't just like live off if if
[49:06] we're talking like the dollar doesn't
[49:07] exist you can't just like live off of
[49:09] your Bitcoins forever because eventually
[49:13] you just spend your Bitcoins to zero of
[49:14] course if technology deflation is
[49:16] accelerating massively then maybe like
[49:18] to some extent you can because things
[49:20] are getting cheaper and cheaper every
[49:21] year and you have to spend less and less
[49:23] Bitcoins but at the end of the day your
[49:25] your Bitcoin stack is going down over
[49:27] time because you are spending your
[49:29] Bitcoins so that's kind of how I think
[49:32] that that wealth might change in the
[49:33] future is like the wealthy you know may
[49:37] not actually stay wealthy forever and
[49:38] ever um you actually might if the dollar
[49:41] doesn't exist which is very very far
[49:43] away if that ever even happens um then
[49:46] you actually would have to spend your
[49:47] Bitcoin um and and that would kind of be
[49:49] a complete change of of how the wealthy
[49:52] live
[49:53] today this would then also restore
[49:57] uh true free market and and true
[49:59] capitalism and not that weird capitalism
[50:03] that we have right now where the capital
[50:05] itself isn't even free yep yeah
[50:08] exactly really really cool yeah I'm I'm
[50:11] really looking forward to to to to that
[50:13] I hope it comes as as quick as
[50:16] possible really good um then one thing
[50:19] before we uh come to the end of the
[50:21] podcast I want to get into uh in how we
[50:26] measure
[50:27] uh the growth of Bitcoin I know uh
[50:30] bitcoin price predictions of Bitcoin uh
[50:33] price talks are always really really uh
[50:36] popular uh because not because uh like
[50:40] it's probably uh uh popular because
[50:42] people really want to know like where is
[50:45] my Bitcoin going what is the potential
[50:47] of Bitcoin and before we get into that
[50:51] and maybe your thoughts on that how do
[50:53] we even measure the growth and the
[50:56] success of of Bitcoin is US dollar price
[50:58] really the the best one or do do you see
[51:01] it something else or how do you see
[51:03] yourself like how do
[51:05] you uh assess yourself what is a
[51:08] successful Bitcoin what metrics are you
[51:10] looking
[51:11] at that's really a question because I
[51:13] think like some bitcoiners or some
[51:16] people will be like oh price doesn't
[51:17] matter um blah blah blah blah but I
[51:20] honestly like I I think price does
[51:22] matter like I think if Bitcoin was at $1
[51:24] per Bitcoin then like a lot of of us
[51:26] would not be here and we'd not be
[51:27] talking about it um and and of course
[51:30] like when we say the dollar price of
[51:32] Bitcoin is going is likely going to
[51:34] continue going up in a very aggressive
[51:37] manner that doesn't mean like that we're
[51:39] thinking that you should be thinking
[51:41] like oh it buys one Bitcoin buys a
[51:43] $100,000 or $200,000 or a million
[51:46] dollars it's really like it buys
[51:49] $100,000 worth of goods and services
[51:51] that I eventually might want or at least
[51:54] I might want the optionality of having
[51:57] um like or like I might want the
[51:58] optionality of buying a house that's
[52:00] worth happens to be worth $100,000
[52:02] $500,000 a million doll whatever
[52:04] whatever it is you kind of want the
[52:05] optionality of that and so I I think
[52:08] because like the dollar is effectively
[52:10] the world unit of account it is kind of
[52:13] a pretty good measurement it's it
[52:15] happens to be like why everyone is
[52:17] obsessed with you know the price of
[52:18] Bitcoin whether that's healthy or not
[52:20] healthy is probably another conversation
[52:22] I guess but um yeah I mean I think it's
[52:24] a good way to measure bitcoin's growth
[52:27] and the value of Bitcoin because that's
[52:29] how the world currently today measures
[52:31] wealth eventually I think the world will
[52:33] measure wealth in Bitcoin itself and
[52:34] there won't be like this intermediary uh
[52:37] currency that's in the middle but for
[52:39] now yeah I think like the dollar is a is
[52:41] a good way to to measure the price of
[52:44] Bitcoin and do you uh think that there
[52:47] is some value towards models like we had
[52:52] stock to flow model I think you even
[52:54] made a video about that if I'm not
[52:56] staken uh and now the the the the new
[52:59] one is the power lot that seems to be
[53:02] very popular at least this year uh and
[53:05] there are probably other ones like Jesse
[53:07] Myers I'm I'm a big fan of of his work
[53:09] also where he just like okay what is the
[53:11] percentage of what Bitcoin will cover uh
[53:14] and then going from today's value and
[53:17] then seeing what you can purchase from
[53:19] that in the future uh what is your like
[53:21] do you have a favorite of them or do
[53:23] they make uh sense in measuring the the
[53:26] future
[53:27] growth yeah it's a great question it's
[53:29] fun to think about um I think they're
[53:33] all I think I like them all like I don't
[53:35] I don't hate any of them per se um I
[53:38] think they're all like to some extent
[53:40] useful to like just help normal people
[53:43] visualize what's happening and what
[53:45] might happen in the future whether
[53:47] that's the power law model the stock to
[53:49] flow model or Jesse Meyers model which I
[53:52] also like or even sailor's new model
[53:54] whereas like he had the the Bitcoin 24
[53:57] Excel sheet that he put out and uh you
[53:59] know what he presented in Nashville
[54:01] where he kind of it's kind of like a
[54:02] variation of the power law but he
[54:04] projected like $ 13 million per Bitcoin
[54:07] or something like that in in 2040 or or
[54:10] 2044 or something some one year like
[54:12] that um I think they're all useful like
[54:16] kind of the the simple and the best way
[54:18] that I like to think about it thinking
[54:20] from first principles is gold is a $20
[54:25] 20 trillion asset Bitcoin is currently
[54:27] about a $1 trillion asset a little more
[54:29] now at the very least I think Bitcoin
[54:32] you have a very easy case to make that
[54:35] Bitcoin is at least digital gold like it
[54:38] it it it's probably a lot better than
[54:40] digital gold but at the very least it
[54:42] should be the exact same valuation as
[54:44] gold it's more scarce than gold it's
[54:46] more divisible than gold it's more
[54:48] portable than gold uh it's arguably more
[54:50] fungible than gold more verifiable than
[54:52] gold like evaluating you know different
[54:56] on their monetary properties and then
[54:58] you clearly see that Bitcoin is better
[55:00] like the only thing that might be worse
[55:01] per se is like Bitcoin has only been
[55:03] around for 15 years and Gold's been
[55:05] around for thousands of years but that's
[55:07] not really a good argument like that's
[55:08] just like history and doesn't it's like
[55:11] it's like if uh Google exists today and
[55:13] chat GPT comes out and everyone starts
[55:15] using chat GPT and chat GPT starts
[55:18] earning taking all the ad Revenue
[55:19] theoretical example and no one's using
[55:21] Google anymore then that doesn't mean
[55:23] that like you should still hold all of
[55:25] your wealth in Google like you should
[55:26] probably move a lot of your wealth into
[55:27] chat GPT because they're going to make
[55:30] all the money starting now um obviously
[55:33] that's not a perfect example but I think
[55:35] it's kind of the same thing with Bitcoin
[55:36] and gold is you have a better technology
[55:39] that exists for saving value into the
[55:41] future and Bitcoin is you know that's
[55:45] that's what Bitcoin is and so Bitcoin is
[55:47] probably going to be worth at least the
[55:50] amount of gold uh and and and maybe like
[55:52] the market is inefficient right now and
[55:54] it's taking time to correct to the price
[55:58] of gold um or a lot higher but I think
[56:01] if you look through history it's like if
[56:02] you are an economist that believes in
[56:05] efficient markets and you think that uh
[56:07] prices do Trend towards their most
[56:09] efficient price then I think that that's
[56:11] kind of the best argument as to like why
[56:13] Bitcoin has done so well over the last
[56:15] 15 years because the market is like
[56:17] correcting as aggressively and as fast
[56:20] as possible to the the most efficient
[56:23] price that Bitcoin should be trading at
[56:24] and obviously we have 8 humans that are
[56:27] all imperfect and trying to figure out
[56:30] how to allocate Capital throughout the
[56:31] world but the best argument for like
[56:34] Bitcoin and for like efficient markets
[56:35] is like that's why Bitcoin has a
[56:37] compound annual growth rate of like
[56:39] hundred and something percent over the
[56:40] last 15 years or whatever it is because
[56:44] the market is literally trying to
[56:45] correct upwards towards the price of
[56:47] gold or towards 10x the price of gold or
[56:50] whatever it really should be um so I
[56:52] think the models are useful I think
[56:54] there's even simple ways to think about
[56:57] it like just you know the comparable
[56:59] from Bitcoin to Gold um but I think like
[57:02] at the end of the day probably a model
[57:03] like Jesse Meyers where he's like
[57:06] pointing out that Bitcoin should take X
[57:09] percentage from Real Estate X percentage
[57:11] from gold X percentage from equities I
[57:15] think that's probably the the best way
[57:16] to think about it but it's also like the
[57:18] world is going to change so much over
[57:20] the next 20 years that it's going to be
[57:23] very hard to tell like what exactly you
[57:26] know bit with the exact percentage that
[57:28] Bitcoin will be taking from each of
[57:29] those asset classes so at the end of the
[57:32] day it's just a guess my guess is is uh
[57:35] that I'm pretty confident in is that the
[57:37] real price of Bitcoin should be a lot
[57:39] lot lot higher than it is
[57:42] today that seems to be a a good guess
[57:45] yeah it's it's the last point that you
[57:47] mentioned is really interesting also
[57:49] because um like even if we like just
[57:52] assume like okay Bitcoin will take up
[57:54] like I don't know 50% 30% of the whole
[57:58] uh Market that is there right now but
[58:01] then there is also the thing okay we
[58:03] will probably lose some Bitcoin we
[58:04] already lost some Bitcoin so you cannot
[58:06] measure it against 21 you probably have
[58:08] to measure it against 50 million maybe
[58:10] we'll lose another two three four five
[58:13] million Bitcoin in the future I don't
[58:15] know uh and then there's this thing
[58:17] coming okay we will get more humans uh
[58:20] maybe in in the future we'll we'll have
[58:24] if we want to survive we have to have a
[58:25] positive wor R uh long run otherwise
[58:28] humans uh will distinct anyways uh then
[58:32] maybe they're coming other planets but
[58:33] that's like really far far in the future
[58:37] and then one thing I think that's
[58:39] usually not mentioned is we are getting
[58:42] so much more productive and efficient in
[58:44] doing things there are AI Bots and like
[58:47] what what does that has an impact on the
[58:49] Bitcoin priz if uh we have not only 10
[58:53] billion people working on the planet but
[58:55] also
[58:56] uh 50 billion EI Bots that do a lot of
[59:00] the things and maybe like physical uh
[59:03] Bots that do house cleaning and all the
[59:05] things that we kind of don't have to
[59:07] work a lot of the things and everything
[59:09] is automated so um that that's what
[59:13] makes even the uh the thing like oh
[59:16] let's let's just like look at what the
[59:18] full potential of Bitcoin is like yeah
[59:20] it's truly Infinity there there's a
[59:22] limit to that but the the the the limit
[59:26] is moving up with time like it's like
[59:29] the carrot in front of the horse it's
[59:31] like you never really reach the limit so
[59:35] I like the meme where like Bitcoin goes
[59:37] through to infinity even though it's not
[59:40] correct M matically because you always
[59:42] have a limit but the limit is kind of
[59:45] moving up with the humans getting more
[59:49] efficient uh if if that's a it's a good
[59:52] way to look at it I don't know if you
[59:54] think yeah no absolutely I mean it's
[59:56] like explaining to uh someone 200 years
[59:59] ago that we could even have this
[60:02] conversation right now it's like how
[60:03] much would you pay or how much how much
[60:05] would it cost for someone 200 years to
[60:07] go to communicate with someone in the
[60:10] United States and someone in Europe it's
[60:12] like that there's not even a price for
[60:14] that like that was impossible 200 years
[60:16] ago now it's like that same thing is
[60:18] going to play out with new products and
[60:19] services that we cannot even imagine and
[60:22] then it's like our very basic
[60:23] necessities like shelter food
[60:26] uh clothing like those are also probably
[60:29] going to become 10x cheaper 100x cheaper
[60:32] especially in Bitcoin terms THX cheaper
[60:34] basically infinitely X cheaper if if
[60:37] technology continues progressing at the
[60:38] rate that it you know historically has
[60:41] then yeah bitcoin's probably going to
[60:43] like levels that people can't even
[60:45] comprehend just like 200 years ago
[60:47] people cannot even comprehend all of the
[60:49] wealth that we really have
[60:51] today I I always bring up um uh my own
[60:55] podcast as as as it's kind of obvious uh
[60:58] as an example for exactly what you just
[61:00] said like just go back 20 years ago and
[61:03] think of the same thing that we are
[61:05] right now doing uh with a daily Bitcoin
[61:09] podcast um bringing out that with
[61:12] different guests all around the world
[61:14] people from Africa people from America
[61:16] people from Australia the same thing
[61:20] about 20 years ago that would be like I
[61:23] don't know 20 people employed with with
[61:26] that and and uh a lot of costs with with
[61:29] uh recording that and planes because you
[61:33] have to like actually move through the
[61:34] countries and get the people where where
[61:36] where they should be because there's not
[61:38] a thing as video conference thing but
[61:41] also if you just look back three four
[61:43] years ago it would also be very hard to
[61:47] keep the pace up because I use a lot of
[61:49] II tools to do a lot of the the the the
[61:52] heavy lifting um even like five years
[61:55] ago I I probably could not do the same
[61:59] pace of podcasts alone like I'm
[62:01] completely it's just me there not any
[62:04] other person working on that so it it
[62:06] gives an idea of how fast we will be at
[62:10] getting efficient and I love that do you
[62:12] brought up that example a lot yeah
[62:15] absolutely it's it's GNA be crazy
[62:18] absolutely really cool um before we come
[62:20] to the end routine I want to give you
[62:21] also the opportunity uh to talk about
[62:24] Unchained uh I understand it Unchained
[62:27] is offering a collaborative uh multi
[62:31] signature solution is it like two out of
[62:33] three three out of five what are you
[62:36] offering yeah it's a great question so
[62:39] obviously we talked about Bitcoin a lot
[62:41] here and and we we we we are explaining
[62:45] the importance of like number go up and
[62:48] and why it's very highly likely that the
[62:50] number is going to go up a lot and
[62:51] you're going to have a lot of potential
[62:52] wealth but like the key to all of this
[62:55] is like you have to be able to securely
[62:58] hold your Bitcoin for the next few years
[63:00] or decades or even generations and so a
[63:03] lot of people you know they'll buy a
[63:04] hardware wallet they'll store it on an
[63:06] exchange they'll hold it with an ETF but
[63:09] I would argue that the best way to go
[63:11] about holding Bitcoin is with some form
[63:13] of collaborative custody where there's
[63:16] not a single point of failure when it
[63:18] comes to holding your Bitcoin right like
[63:19] if you hold your Bitcoin on an exchange
[63:21] or an ETF or a single Hardware wallet
[63:25] that's those are all single points of
[63:27] failure like if the hardare wallet
[63:28] disappears or your seed phrase
[63:29] disappears your bitcoin's gone if the
[63:32] exchange you forget your password and
[63:34] you can't contact support or the
[63:36] exchange gets hacked your Bitcoin are
[63:38] gone if the ETF if your brokerage
[63:40] account locks you out you you out your
[63:42] government locks you out of your
[63:43] brokerage account or the ETF custodian
[63:45] loses the Bitcoin your Bitcoin is gone
[63:48] so on Unchained what what we do is we
[63:51] enable multisig custody collaborative
[63:54] multisig custody this effectively just
[63:56] means that there's multiple keys that
[63:59] secure your Bitcoin and so in the
[64:01] example that you brought up you can have
[64:03] a personal Vault where there's three
[64:05] keys that secure your Bitcoin and
[64:07] protect your Bitcoin two of those three
[64:09] keys are required to move the Bitcoin
[64:12] out of your Vault and in the example of
[64:15] a personal Vault you can hold two keys
[64:18] and then you unchain holds the the third
[64:20] key and so in that scenario where you
[64:24] happen to lose one of your keys one of
[64:25] of your Hardware wallets gets destroyed
[64:27] or one of your seed phrases gets
[64:29] destroyed or stolen you don't actually
[64:31] lose all your Bitcoin you you you have
[64:34] no single point of failure because you
[64:35] only need two keys and you happen to
[64:37] have one remaining still if you happen
[64:39] to have lost one and then unchain has
[64:42] one as a backup and so I would say like
[64:44] when it comes to securely holding your
[64:46] long-term savings for the very long term
[64:50] you need to make sure that there's not a
[64:51] single point of failure for your Bitcoin
[64:52] and and you can do that with with
[64:54] Unchained yeah it's it's definitely I
[64:58] think it's the the the sleekest way to
[65:02] to hold bit coin like there are a lot of
[65:05] I I love and I always push that a lot on
[65:08] on the channel also I always want to
[65:11] encourage people do do self- custody uh
[65:14] and obviously as you mentioned the first
[65:15] step is just to like have a hardare
[65:17] wallet and that's probably like a good
[65:19] way to to start uh and then you just
[65:23] like go go down the rabbit hole of like
[65:25] okay like okay I have a hardare wallet
[65:27] but then I need a backup so I bought a
[65:30] steel wallet and then you own but what
[65:33] if someone comes I know like multi
[65:34] signature oh but then there's all the
[65:37] people then let's let's incorporate
[65:39] another uh company with a collaborative
[65:41] ctive if Unchained or something like
[65:43] that so it's it's a it's a deep rabbit
[65:45] hole and I encourage everyone to go down
[65:48] there because this is probably the most
[65:51] important thing that's the second most
[65:53] important thing after I need Bitcoin uh
[65:57] is like I need self-
[65:59] custody that's uh that's probably the
[66:01] most important thing after getting
[66:03] getting the the monetary aspect of of
[66:06] Bitcoin is really really cool perfect
[66:07] then yeah thank you so much already um
[66:09] we have two end routines the first one
[66:11] is the same question for every guest um
[66:14] what can we learn from you besides
[66:17] Bitcoin that's a good question
[66:19] um for me beside Bitcoin I would say
[66:23] like I mean I I'll talk about my report
[66:25] which was yes about Bitcoin but also
[66:28] about like technology and kind of
[66:29] exactly what you were talking about like
[66:32] highly advancing uh you know how how
[66:35] advanced Humanity has been in the report
[66:37] I have this section called the
[66:38] acceleration of production where I go
[66:40] through like food energy Lumber and a
[66:43] few other sections uh telecommunication
[66:45] stuff like that and data storage and it
[66:47] shows like over the last 100 plus years
[66:49] like how much more productive we are at
[66:52] these things that are effectively
[66:54] producing basic consumer goods that we
[66:56] all need like food Lumber uh shelter uh
[66:59] data storage whatnot and you know those
[67:02] things have gotten more expensive in
[67:04] dollar terms but they are but we're
[67:07] actually like able to produce a lot more
[67:09] of them just in terms of like how
[67:11] productive we are for example like in
[67:13] the year 1900 um one US farmer was able
[67:17] to feed four people on average today one
[67:21] US farmer can feed 150 plus people on
[67:24] average and so that's just showing that
[67:26] like food's gotten a lot more expensive
[67:29] but we're becoming a lot more productive
[67:30] at food and I have a lot more other
[67:32] examples in that report that anyone's H
[67:35] you know you're welcome to go check out
[67:36] it's actually unchain dcom melting but
[67:39] um that's kind of like I'm I'm highly
[67:41] interested in like accelerating
[67:44] technology and and seeing like what's
[67:46] going to happen over the next decade and
[67:48] kind of what has happened over the last
[67:49] century I think that that's a a great
[67:51] place to to start and I I did a lot of
[67:54] research and and thought about it a lot
[67:56] um in that report yeah really really
[67:59] cool thank you so much I think that uh
[68:01] everyone should uh check that out other
[68:04] entertainers of the podcast is where the
[68:06] previous guest is asking a question for
[68:07] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:09] next guest actually is and the question
[68:11] is an interesting one I almost asked it
[68:15] before when we talked about Bitcoin but
[68:17] I kept it for the end routine because
[68:18] the previous guest ask it what role do
[68:21] you think lightning plays once we are at
[68:24] hyperbitcoinization
[68:25] one the layer tools yeah I mean one I
[68:29] would say it's it's going to be I'm very
[68:31] bullish on lightning and I think it's
[68:32] potentially like the way that Bitcoin
[68:34] has passed around um as a medium of
[68:36] exchange post hyperbitcoinization
[68:39] um and and I think one thing that might
[68:41] be interesting in regards to this is I
[68:44] think most Bitcoin will still sit in
[68:46] like cold storage and never really move
[68:49] um and when I say most Bitcoin I'm
[68:50] thinking like 90% 99% and effectively
[68:54] like 1% of all Bitcoin might be on the
[68:56] lightning Network or maybe even less
[68:58] than that and then that's kind of the
[68:59] Bitcoin that's being passed around and
[69:01] used for Commerce on a daily basis and
[69:04] most Bitcoin will just sit there and and
[69:06] not really move because its utility is
[69:08] going to be long-term savings um so yeah
[69:11] I think like lightning has the potential
[69:13] to be the way that we move Bitcoins
[69:16] around and and communicate value and buy
[69:19] things sell things and so I'm hyper
[69:22] bullish on lightning um but you know
[69:24] time will tell
[69:26] yeah absolutely really cool uh Before I
[69:28] Let You Go um where can people find you
[69:31] personally where can they ask your
[69:34] questions yeah you can find me
[69:36] personally on Twitter and YouTube uh I'm
[69:40] uh Joe berett on Twitter my handle is I
[69:42] II capital and then on YouTube you can
[69:45] just type in jernet Bitcoin and I I
[69:47] should pop up there and then if you want
[69:48] to learn more about Unchained and how to
[69:50] securely hold Bitcoin for Generations
[69:52] you can go to unchain dcom um and and
[69:54] check us out
[69:56] really cool thank you so much Joe for
[69:58] for being on also thank you so much for
[69:59] everyone that is watching and listening
[70:02] uh for joining us today as always I'll
[70:04] be back tomorrow with another episode
