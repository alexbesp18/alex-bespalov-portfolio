[00:00] The ironic thing about Bitcoin being
[00:02] money is that it gets us to stop
[00:03] thinking about money. If life starts to
[00:05] get easier over time because we have
[00:06] more capacity as our purchasing power is
[00:08] going up, we start fixating less on
[00:10] money and more on how we're going to
[00:12] show up and what is important to us and
[00:14] what it is that we value. And so I think
[00:16] monetary expression is so important and
[00:17] Bitcoin on the flip side of that realign
[00:20] all of those things. And so all of a
[00:22] sudden if we can direct capital to where
[00:24] we see fit, well guess what? areas of
[00:26] the economy that actually are offering
[00:28] value start to thrive. We live in a
[00:30] world where the government continually
[00:31] step in and they put barriers for people
[00:34] to express themselves. We're always just
[00:36] trying to be able to seek truth. And I
[00:38] don't see it as in like a negative thing
[00:39] or a fearful thing that it's just like,
[00:41] oh my god, the world is so broken. I
[00:43] look at it more from the perspective
[00:44] that if we're trying to seek truth,
[00:46] that's the only way at which we can
[00:47] alter our trajectory towards actually
[00:49] creating a society of prosperity.
[00:51] Daytoday you have these conversations
[00:53] with individuals and they'll throw out a
[00:54] comment and you're like, "Huh, that's
[00:56] interesting. How did you come to that?"
[00:58] And you'll find their 30 steps up the
[01:00] ladder, but they can't explain the 30
[01:02] steps that got them up the ladder.
[01:05] [Music]
[01:08] Hi, Se. How are you doing? Everything
[01:10] fine on your end? Oh, man. It's great to
[01:12] be back, Robin. I think we recorded I
[01:14] don't know, maybe like 18 months ago,
[01:16] and I really really enjoyed our
[01:17] conversation. And I mentioned beforehand
[01:19] that I just think you have such a way
[01:21] with words and the way that you
[01:22] interview. Uh it brings people in and so
[01:24] I'm really looking forward to our
[01:25] conversation. Oh man, thank you so much.
[01:27] That's that's really kind of you. Um
[01:29] maybe as a fun first question because I
[01:32] I had that got that question today and I
[01:34] never asked it anyone. So I'm I'm I'm
[01:37] trying it with you. What do you think
[01:40] most Bitcoiners don't realize about
[01:43] Bitcoin that you actually believe in?
[01:45] So, I would say, oh man, I love this
[01:48] question. This is such a good question.
[01:50] Um, I would say there's kind of like two
[01:53] components. The first is the ironic
[01:56] thing about Bitcoin being digital money
[01:58] is that it gets us to stop thinking
[02:00] about money. the world we live in today
[02:02] because money is broken down and it
[02:05] makes it almost impossible for us to
[02:06] save and to be able to kind of thrive.
[02:10] We become so fixated on money because
[02:12] we're simply just trying to put food on
[02:13] the table, put a roof over our heads
[02:15] that we're constantly focusing on money.
[02:17] Now, what's interesting about Bitcoin is
[02:19] the opposite is true. If life starts to
[02:21] get easier over time because we have
[02:23] more capacity as our purchasing power is
[02:25] going up, we start fixating less on
[02:27] money and more on how we're going to
[02:29] show up and what is important to us and
[02:31] what it is that we value. And so the
[02:34] ironic thing about Bitcoin being money
[02:36] is that it gets us to stop thinking
[02:37] about money. And the second part to that
[02:39] is that I believe personally that
[02:42] Bitcoin its most pure essence is that
[02:45] it's a spiritual tool. I think it's a
[02:47] spiritual tool in that the world today,
[02:50] we're so disconnected because we're so
[02:52] stuck on survival. We're so stuck on
[02:55] just trying to exist because life is
[02:57] hard that we're not thinking about our
[03:00] intuition. We're not listening to what
[03:02] our body is telling us. We're not
[03:03] listening to the world around us and all
[03:04] the kind of the signs and the symptoms
[03:06] that are taking place. We're just simply
[03:08] existing because when we're fearful, our
[03:10] aperture of awareness narrows. And so I
[03:13] think Bitcoin is a spiritual tool in
[03:14] that again as we have more capacity, we
[03:17] have more time to look inwards. As we
[03:19] have more time to look inwards, we have
[03:20] more ability to listen to that small
[03:23] little subtle intuition guiding us in
[03:25] certain directions. Or if the world is
[03:27] trying to lead us in a certain
[03:28] trajectory, we're able to listen to
[03:30] those cues. And so I think Bitcoin is a
[03:32] spiritual tool and that it supports us
[03:34] growing as a community, building
[03:36] culture, supporting us. I think it is
[03:39] it's profound just because it gives us
[03:40] more capacity
[03:42] I heard that before spiritual that that
[03:44] Bitcoin is spiritual money. I forgot who
[03:47] from whom I heard it but there was
[03:49] someone that said uh Bitcoin is
[03:51] spiritual money. I I love I love that
[03:52] description. There's you know what
[03:54] there's a uh early on in my Bitcoin
[03:57] journey um I haven't been in Bitcoin
[03:59] that super super long. And I'm not one
[04:01] of the the OGs, but I would say I was
[04:03] very curious about Bitcoin in kind of
[04:05] like 2018 2019 and ended up going full
[04:08] head over heels like down the rabbit
[04:10] hole in 2020. And in around 2020, 2021,
[04:14] um I stumbled upon across a guy named
[04:16] Sam Catharo. And he is he doesn't have
[04:19] that many followers. I don't understand
[04:21] how. and he's a Bitcoiner and he has a a
[04:23] podcast called Bitcoin consciousness
[04:25] that I don't know if he even posts on
[04:27] anymore but it was all about Bitcoin and
[04:29] spirituality and he is one of the most
[04:31] profound individuals and so if you're
[04:33] interested in the spiritual space I just
[04:35] yeah I I think that as a community what
[04:37] I think so interesting is we have people
[04:39] from all different backgrounds whether
[04:41] it's like economics whether it is just
[04:43] like single moms that are interested in
[04:44] Bitcoin whether it is uh people that are
[04:46] interested in just kind of finance in
[04:48] general whether it is a builder you name
[04:50] it but I think that what we're starting
[04:51] to see is a growing spiritual component
[04:53] because people that are more focused in
[04:56] that area are recognizing that we have a
[04:59] lack of groundedness in society and
[05:01] Bitcoin gives us that capacity to look
[05:03] inwards more and become more grounded
[05:05] which I think is profound.
[05:07] This is actually a question that so for
[05:09] me right now I'm
[05:12] so I'm very much of the belief that we
[05:15] are right now very early and Bitcoin
[05:18] will become the global reserve asset and
[05:21] I'm just curious on two things. How we
[05:24] get there and what that will do to
[05:28] society. Those are the two questions
[05:29] that I'm basically wondering about. The
[05:32] other questions are kind of solved for
[05:34] me in my head. So, so those are the the
[05:37] very open question for me still. Uh, do
[05:39] we come peacefully hidden? Is it like a
[05:41] steady and slow or is it like there's
[05:43] some some Samsung M Omega candle in
[05:46] there? Um, how do we get there? And also
[05:48] like what implication does it have if I
[05:51] think you wrote the book hidden cost of
[05:53] money if if there's no more in inflation
[05:56] and the spiritual aspect is is really
[05:58] interesting in that question. How will
[06:02] Bitcoin actually impact our daily lives?
[06:05] Like I'm wondering about that so much.
[06:08] So, you know what? I'll start with the
[06:09] second one. Uh the second question first
[06:11] and then I'll go back to the first one.
[06:13] And I think that in in my book, The
[06:15] Hidden Cost of Money, one of the ways
[06:17] that I look at money, it's slightly
[06:19] different to kind of just as your
[06:20] standard just medium of exchange that
[06:22] most people look at money. I look at it
[06:25] also as a medium of expression like
[06:27] language. is how we express to the world
[06:30] what it is that we value. Just like we
[06:32] use voice to express to the world our
[06:34] thoughts, what it is that we value
[06:36] internally, money is used to express to
[06:38] the world what we value monetarily. And
[06:40] so you can if you walk into, I don't
[06:42] know, a grocery store and you see
[06:44] someone buying grass-fed beef and
[06:45] organic vegetables and then another
[06:47] person buying cigarettes and microwave
[06:50] meals, you can see what it is that they
[06:52] value by how they direct their capital.
[06:54] Now the problem that we face in society
[06:56] today is that because we're facing
[06:58] inflation, our purchasing power is
[07:00] declining, it's impacting our ability to
[07:02] direct capital towards what we value. If
[07:05] by the time I have worked and I've
[07:07] earned some money and then I've saved
[07:08] that money and then I go to spend it,
[07:10] but my purchasing power has diminished
[07:12] 30%. Then I have 30% less capacity to
[07:15] show up authentically and direct my
[07:17] capital where I see fit. And then on top
[07:19] of that, it's not just inflation. We see
[07:21] things like capital controls. If you
[07:22] live in China and what you value is
[07:24] supporting your family and all of a
[07:27] sudden the Chinese government is like,
[07:28] "Well, you're not allowed to invest in
[07:30] international assets, it's going to be
[07:31] really hard for you to be able to
[07:32] withdraw your funds outside of China."
[07:34] Well, all of a sudden it becomes very
[07:36] hard for you to direct capital towards
[07:39] what you value, which is protecting your
[07:40] family. You may want to protect your
[07:42] purchasing power so you can support your
[07:43] kids in the future, but your purchasing
[07:45] power is being diminished in the local
[07:46] currency. Um, and then finally, you also
[07:48] just have regulations which are propping
[07:50] up industries and altering how cash
[07:53] flows in society. So it may say you can
[07:56] spend money here, but you can't spend
[07:57] money there. And so what that's doing is
[07:59] it's impeding our ability to express
[08:01] ourselves monetarily. It's impeding our
[08:03] ability to direct capital to what it is
[08:06] that we value as individuals. Now, if I
[08:08] take a step back and look at kind of an
[08:11] analogous situation, well, if as a child
[08:15] our parents didn't allow us to express
[08:17] certain emotions, like let's say our mom
[08:18] was like, "We don't want you to be sad."
[08:21] So, anytime you start crying, they're
[08:22] just like, "Give you a candy bar or try
[08:24] to stop you from crying." Or, "Anytime
[08:26] you're angry," they're just like, "We
[08:27] don't want you to be like, "You're not
[08:28] allowed to be angry in this house." So,
[08:29] they stop you from being angry and they
[08:31] put you in the corner. Well, what is
[08:33] depression? Depression is the depressing
[08:35] of emotions. It is when we're not
[08:37] allowed to express ourselves fully. So
[08:39] as an adult, we don't know how to
[08:41] express those emotions. And so it leads
[08:42] to all of these symptoms, these anxiety,
[08:45] depression, drug use, suicide. And so I
[08:48] would say that the issues we face in
[08:49] society today, whether it is uh huge
[08:53] environmental destruction because of our
[08:54] consumption habits, whether it is a
[08:56] breakdown in the parent child bond
[08:58] because parents having to work more
[09:00] because their money is worth less.
[09:01] Whether it is a breakdown in politics
[09:03] because governments can fund themselves
[09:04] endlessly without support from the
[09:06] populace. Whether it is a breakdown in
[09:08] business practices because they're
[09:10] incentivized to take risks because they
[09:12] continually are bailed out. I would say
[09:14] all of these are symptoms of people not
[09:17] being able to express themselves
[09:18] monetarily and directing money to where
[09:21] they see fit. And so I think monetary
[09:23] expression is so important. And Bitcoin
[09:24] on the flip side of that realign all of
[09:27] those things. And so all of a sudden if
[09:30] we can direct capital to where we see
[09:32] fit, well guess what? Areas of the
[09:34] economy that actually are offering value
[09:36] start to thrive. And not only that, but
[09:39] if you're living in a nation and you do
[09:40] not agree with what the nation is doing,
[09:43] you do not agree with what the direction
[09:44] the current uh the government is going,
[09:46] well, if enough people decide, you know
[09:48] what, I'm going to direct my capital
[09:50] where I see fit, maybe I'm going to
[09:51] leave the country, maybe I'm just going
[09:53] to store my money in per in Bitcoin, it
[09:55] becomes very hard for that government to
[09:57] thrive if you're operating on a Bitcoin
[09:59] standard. And so I very much believe
[10:01] that Bitcoin flips all the incentives on
[10:04] its head. At the moment our incentives
[10:06] towards kind of like fiscal
[10:08] irresponsibility, there's breakdown in
[10:10] connection. Life is getting harder. The
[10:12] incentives flip to the other side which
[10:14] all of a sudden we have more capacity as
[10:16] our purchasing power is increasing. That
[10:18] gives immense benefits to say parents.
[10:21] Parents have more capacity to spend time
[10:22] with their kids, support their kids
[10:24] more. It also has immense benefits for
[10:27] businesses. Businesses has has to be
[10:29] fiscally responsible. If they're not, if
[10:30] they borrow beyond their means, then
[10:32] they're going to slowly wither away. So
[10:33] incentivizes value creation. It allows
[10:36] individuals to direct capital to areas
[10:37] of the economy that are actually
[10:38] offering value as opposed to those that
[10:40] are just being propped up by
[10:41] intervention. And so I think that to me
[10:44] it really all of the incentives in
[10:46] society and that is I just find
[10:49] profound. Um to answer kind of your
[10:52] first question which is what does it
[10:54] look like actually getting there? That's
[10:56] hard. It's it's so challenging because I
[10:59] think that the reality is that we've
[11:02] borrowed beyond our means for so long
[11:05] that in order to be able to transition
[11:07] to a new system, we have to live within
[11:09] our means. We have so much debt that if
[11:11] the system was to implode in on itself
[11:12] right now, there would be so much pain.
[11:15] There would be so much carnage. And so
[11:17] Jeff Booth always talks about kind of
[11:19] building a parallel system. And what
[11:22] we're trying to do is just increasingly
[11:24] increase the size of that bridge over to
[11:25] that parallel system. And in time,
[11:28] people realize, huh, those people that
[11:30] are living over there in the parallel
[11:31] system, life seems to be getting easier
[11:33] for them. They seem to be thriving. And
[11:35] at that at a certain point, the pain of
[11:37] existing in the current system becomes
[11:39] greater than the energy expenditure and
[11:42] the pain of transitioning to a new
[11:44] system. And so, what I'm hoping is that
[11:46] we're building out the rails right now.
[11:48] We're building out the custodial
[11:50] self-custodial features to make it more
[11:52] and more user friendly. We're building
[11:54] out kind of whether it's the companies
[11:56] to be able to onboard these individuals
[11:58] so that by the time uh we start to see
[12:00] more of a mass adoption of it, we have
[12:03] the capacity to do so because I don't
[12:04] know if we have the capacity to do so
[12:06] right now and I don't think the user
[12:08] experience especially when it comes to
[12:10] say self- custody uh is there yet for
[12:13] the average individual.
[12:15] Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. There's always
[12:16] this question, what if 100% of the world
[12:20] all of the sudden wants to go on Bitcoin
[12:22] tomorrow? I think we're not ready for
[12:23] that. I think the rails are not there
[12:24] yet. The custodians are not there yet.
[12:26] The services are not there yet. The
[12:28] infrastructure it's just not working out
[12:31] right now. Uh also with what that means
[12:33] for for the main layer and we have to go
[12:36] on the the second layer because there's
[12:38] not enough space. So, so that it's it's
[12:42] good if it's gradual. We we want to the
[12:44] the Titanic to sing slow and uh the the
[12:47] lifebo to slowly slowly increase in size
[12:50] uh with Bitcoin. But one thing that uh
[12:53] was really interesting what you said is
[12:54] monetary expression. We we I think we
[12:57] don't think as of money as language. We
[13:01] don't think about money being something
[13:04] that is
[13:05] expressive. But it is expressive. It is
[13:08] a language. We we use it as gifts like
[13:10] in Austria. I don't know if it's in
[13:11] America also like that but if you uh
[13:14] like a kid and you have birthday like
[13:16] you're getting I don't know 10 years old
[13:18] 12 years old it's custom that the aunts
[13:21] and the uncles give you like €10 and5
[13:24] for for your birthday to get you started
[13:25] in life and stuff like that. So there
[13:28] are so many traditions and and and
[13:30] function society where we use bitcoin
[13:33] not only as hey you give me that good
[13:36] and I give you that as as money as
[13:38] exchange but we actually use bitcoin
[13:41] like money directly as a language of
[13:45] gifting someone something. There are
[13:47] many different uh things like that. So
[13:50] fear is kind of manipulating our
[13:53] language. It's kind of putting a a noise
[13:56] into the signal of of of of language. I
[13:59] never looked at it as a language. Well,
[14:02] it's it's interesting because I find one
[14:04] thing that I've decided we're I live in
[14:07] Canada and we're about to I think it's
[14:09] like April 27th, we're about to have our
[14:11] election as to who is going to be the
[14:13] prime minister of the country. Now, the
[14:16] the reality on on my end is that I don't
[14:19] believe in the system. So cool, I can
[14:22] vote left or I can vote right. But the
[14:24] reality is although there's someone
[14:26] maybe I would lean a little more right.
[14:28] I would say that I don't want to direct
[14:30] my energy towards the system. And when
[14:32] we vote we are expressing what it is
[14:35] that we value, who it is that we value,
[14:37] who aligns most with our values. We're
[14:39] expressing ourselves. And what people
[14:40] often forget is that well when we vote,
[14:44] we're actually voting twice. We're
[14:46] voting once for the individual and
[14:48] secondly we're voting for the system.
[14:50] We're directing our energy and we're
[14:51] saying we actually support the system.
[14:52] We we support the continuation of the
[14:54] process which has led us to where we are
[14:56] today. And so I think what a lot of
[14:58] people forget about is we have a third
[15:00] way of voting. That third way of voting,
[15:02] that third way of expressing ourselves
[15:05] is money. When we direct our capital to
[15:07] what we value, we are saying we're
[15:10] choosing this over this. This is what we
[15:12] value. It's the same. It's just another
[15:13] form of voting. It's another form of
[15:15] expression. And I think people often
[15:17] forget about that. And like to your
[15:18] point, like when it comes to money
[15:20] breaking down, it's impacting our
[15:22] ability to express what we value. Now,
[15:24] can you imagine if there was regulations
[15:25] in place that basically said on the
[15:27] voting ballot, hey, there's these five
[15:29] people, but there's actually
[15:30] regulations, you can't actually vote for
[15:32] the top three people. You can only vote
[15:33] for the bottom two people, so just
[15:35] forget about the top three people. And
[15:37] that's our monetary system today. It's
[15:39] like, hey, there's industries that we
[15:40] don't believe in. We're going to put
[15:41] regulations that make it incredibly hard
[15:43] for you to be able to go and direct your
[15:45] capital towards those things. For
[15:47] instance, I believe in health and I
[15:50] believe in raw dairy. Well, in Canada,
[15:52] raw dairy is illegal. You cannot go buy
[15:55] raw dairy. So, I cannot go and purchase
[15:58] raw dairy to go and support myself, my
[16:00] family, those that I care about because
[16:02] there's regulation impeding me from
[16:04] doing so. And so this is where I think
[16:05] it's so interesting is that we live in a
[16:07] world where the government continually
[16:09] step in and they put barriers for people
[16:12] to express themselves. Whether that's
[16:14] through money, whether that's through
[16:16] language, through free speech being
[16:17] suppressed, you name it. There's a lot
[16:19] of suppression that we find in society.
[16:22] Wait, raw dairy, is it like milk
[16:24] directly from the farmer? Yeah. That
[16:27] that's that's illegal. Yeah. So this so
[16:30] this is the thing. It's it's it's crazy
[16:32] that the only way that you can buy dairy
[16:35] is pasteurized dairy that is through
[16:37] kind of the grocery store. There is a
[16:40] workound. Like I have what's called a
[16:42] cow share in Canada. And so cow share is
[16:44] if you own cows you're allowed to drink
[16:46] the milk from your own cow. And so
[16:49] because of that people end up doing a
[16:51] cow share where they buy a portion of a
[16:52] cow or a fraction they own a fraction of
[16:54] a cow, a share of a cow. And then you're
[16:57] not paying for the milk, you're paying
[16:59] to service your cow and then you're
[17:01] getting milk from your cow. And so I get
[17:03] around the raw dairy in that regard. But
[17:05] again, what's interesting is this kind
[17:06] of goes back to I believe this ties back
[17:09] to kind of the incentives of the system.
[17:11] And you start to see kind of a breakdown
[17:15] uh when we start to see huge government
[17:17] oversight, increase regulation, it leads
[17:19] to all of these byproducts. And so how
[17:21] did for instance I find this interesting
[17:23] because it ties back to kind of money
[17:24] again but like how did um raw dairy
[17:28] become illegal? Well during the great
[17:30] depression because all of the farmers
[17:32] were struggling financially they didn't
[17:35] have the resources to be able to
[17:38] actually feed their cows proper
[17:40] nutritious food. And so what did they
[17:42] start doing? They went along to the
[17:43] distilleries and they started to feed
[17:45] the cows the output from the
[17:47] distilleries to slop and the cows
[17:49] started to get super sick. But they were
[17:51] still using that milk and selling it.
[17:53] And then so people started to get
[17:55] unbelievably sick from the milk they
[17:56] were drinking from the cows until they
[17:59] realized, "Huh, I wonder what happens if
[18:00] you heat milk up." And so they started
[18:02] to heat milk up, the pasteurization
[18:04] process, which kills the bacteria. But
[18:06] it not only kills the bad bacteria, but
[18:08] it also kills the good bacteria. So
[18:10] you've now completely destroyed a lot of
[18:11] the nutritional value of milk. And the
[18:13] government comes in and says, "You know
[18:14] what? This is good. We're killing all of
[18:16] the bacteria. we're going to actually
[18:18] put regulation in place and say you're
[18:19] not allowed to sell raw milk anymore
[18:21] because it's making people sick. But
[18:23] it's not that it was raw milk that was
[18:24] making people sick. It's that we had a
[18:26] broken financial system that impeded the
[18:29] ability of farmers to be able to support
[18:30] themselves financially which led to the
[18:33] degragation of the quality of food. And
[18:35] I just find this stuff like so
[18:37] fascinating. Like again intervention,
[18:39] monetary intervention, it ends up
[18:41] leading to all of these unintended
[18:42] consequences. And one more quick story
[18:44] I'll share that really kind of stood out
[18:46] to me and I I I believe I mention it in
[18:48] the book uh the hidden cost of money
[18:50] which was during around kind of like the
[18:52] 30s and 40s in the US the government
[18:55] decided to go and subsidize grain
[18:57] production. And so it started pumping
[18:59] millions of dollars into producing
[19:02] different types of grains and corn. And
[19:04] so all of a sudden farmers that were
[19:07] farming they had an incentive. they
[19:08] would make more money if they were to
[19:10] farm certain types of grain as opposed
[19:12] to vegetables or meat, animals, you name
[19:15] it. And so all of a sudden, you had this
[19:17] shift, this artificial shift of farmers
[19:20] move over to grain production. Then as a
[19:23] result of the grain production, we saw a
[19:24] boom in all of the big grain companies.
[19:27] What did this create? Well, we saw
[19:29] Kelloggs, we saw Quakers, a lot of these
[19:31] huge multinational corporations start to
[19:33] explode because they started making a
[19:35] ton of money and grain was super cheap.
[19:37] As a result, we saw things like high
[19:39] fructose corn syrup start to enter the
[19:42] market. Well, guess what we've got now?
[19:44] We've got a massive huge rate of
[19:46] diabetes as a result of all of these
[19:47] processed grain products because there's
[19:49] unbelievable amounts of excess grain.
[19:51] But not only that, Quakers and uh
[19:54] Quakers, what is it? Um, Quakers,
[19:56] Kelloggs, and a lot of these other big
[19:57] grain producers, because they were
[19:59] making so much money from all of the
[20:00] grain subsidies and the excess grain,
[20:02] they started to use that excess money to
[20:05] lobby the government. They lobbyed the
[20:06] FDA and created the food pyramid. And
[20:09] the food pyramid inverted what we
[20:12] thought was healthy. We have
[20:13] traditionally eaten a more animal-based
[20:15] diet with fruits and vegetables on top
[20:17] of that. And then above that, at the top
[20:19] of the pyramid, we have a little bit of
[20:20] grains. Well, we flipped that on its
[20:22] head and all these grain producers,
[20:23] given that they have an incentive to
[20:25] push grain, said the base of our diet
[20:27] should be grain. And at the very tiptop
[20:29] should be animal products. We should
[20:31] minimize the amount of animal products
[20:32] we eat. And what has happened over the
[20:34] last kind of 50 to 80 years, we have
[20:36] seen diabetes skyrocket. We have seen
[20:38] obesity skyrocket. We have seen heart
[20:41] disease skyrocket. We have seen all of
[20:43] this stuff skyrocket as a result of
[20:46] monetary intervention. We intervened
[20:48] monetarily and we altered the course the
[20:50] incentives towards what people naturally
[20:52] want. And I just find that profound. I
[20:55] want to share um this with you because I
[20:58] I laughed really out loud when I when
[21:00] you said like not able to buy raw milk.
[21:03] Uh the gives me a little bit of hope for
[21:06] Austria because we have something it's
[21:09] called upho for cough. It's means
[21:11] basically buy it directly from the
[21:13] farmer. And uh there are many many
[21:16] farmers. Uh I in my hometown
[21:20] uh there are live there are like 5,000
[21:22] people I think they're living there uh
[21:24] where I originally come from and there
[21:27] are probably like 20 farmers where you
[21:31] can directly go there and you can buy
[21:32] it. And how it works is either they open
[21:35] like on a Saturday morning and you can
[21:37] actually buy it like in the supermarket
[21:39] kind of a style. But way more common are
[21:42] those things. Wait, here it was. Yeah.
[21:45] It's basically just like a small wooden
[21:48] house and you can go in there and
[21:50] there's like fridges and you just take
[21:52] it out. You see on the price list how
[21:54] much it is and you just throw the money
[21:56] in. So like like really trust based. You
[21:58] can just rob the all the milk out and
[22:01] all the foods and directly from the farm
[22:03] and and go. But uh yeah, it it works in
[22:06] Austria for for for for some reason. And
[22:10] that's why it was so foreign for me that
[22:13] you cannot buy raw milk because I I only
[22:17] got raw milk when I uh when I I lived up
[22:21] on a farm. I got raw milk every day
[22:23] directly from the cow. I sometimes
[22:25] milked it uh myself. I mean, we had we
[22:28] did not milk it like that. We had like
[22:29] those machines for the cow, but I saw
[22:33] the cow. I I petted the cow that I got
[22:35] the milk from directly. So that's why
[22:38] the the concept is just so so completely
[22:41] out of the norm for me. Never had that.
[22:43] No, it's it's it's wild just the
[22:45] different how different cultures show
[22:48] up. And what's interesting is like I I
[22:50] get raw milk now. I've had raw milk for
[22:51] probably about 2 years, 2 and a half
[22:53] years. And when I have friends come
[22:54] over, I'm just like, "Oh, hey, do you
[22:56] want like milk in your coffee? I have
[22:57] raw milk." And they're just like, "Oh,
[22:58] no. I don't want to touch that stuff.
[23:00] Why would I would never eat I would
[23:02] never drink that." And so you start to
[23:03] realize that when you start intervening
[23:05] monetarily, you create all of these
[23:06] regulations that lead to say basically
[23:09] the illegality of raw milk or the
[23:13] destruction of red meat in society where
[23:15] you think red meat is bad or saturated
[23:17] fats are bad. The average individual has
[23:20] no idea. They're completely brainwashed.
[23:22] And so I just I I think it's fascinating
[23:25] because for me what Bitcoin has done is
[23:29] Bitcoin in a sense and I noticed this
[23:32] with other individuals as well is
[23:34] Bitcoin leads you down this rabbit hole
[23:36] where you start questioning the money
[23:38] and then when you start realizing huh
[23:40] maybe if the monetary system isn't what
[23:41] it seems what other systems aren't what
[23:44] they seem and then you start digging
[23:45] into the healthcare industry the
[23:47] pharmaceutical industry the educational
[23:49] industry and you're just like oh my god
[23:51] like we're living in this world that is
[23:54] a bit of a facade and it is almost like
[23:58] I think there's a reason why Bitcoin is
[24:00] resonate with this whole idea of the
[24:01] matrix. Do you want to take the red pill
[24:03] or the blue pill? Do you want to know
[24:04] you're in the simulation or would you
[24:06] rather step outside uh alo or would you
[24:08] rather just be sucked in and just
[24:10] absorbed into the simulation have no
[24:11] idea? And I think a lot of Bitcoin is
[24:13] what I really admire is we're truth
[24:14] seeking. We're always just trying to be
[24:16] able to seek truth. And I don't see it
[24:18] as in like a negative thing or a fearful
[24:21] thing that is just like, "Oh my god, the
[24:22] world is so broken." I look at it more
[24:24] from the perspective that if we're
[24:26] trying to seek truth, that's the only
[24:28] way at which we can alter our trajectory
[24:30] towards actually creating a society of
[24:32] prosperity, actually creating connection
[24:34] and community and actually moving
[24:36] towards a society where we're healthy
[24:38] and we're thriving. Because if we're not
[24:40] seeking truth, then we're going to be
[24:41] continually blinded by propaganda or
[24:43] this intervention. It's that mind virus
[24:45] like like you the government is trying
[24:48] to to do something and it actually
[24:50] alters the way we we think and it it's
[24:54] so and I catch myself also doing that
[24:57] it's we hold opinions that we heard
[25:01] multiple times but we never really
[25:03] researched and because we heard it
[25:05] multiple times we never questioned it
[25:07] and that's why we hold that opinion but
[25:09] we never actually questioned this thing
[25:12] and I see it so many times So when
[25:14] someone says something that I highly
[25:16] disagree with, I just ask
[25:19] them many why questions and usually
[25:22] after the third why question, they don't
[25:25] really have more substance because they
[25:27] never really thought about why this is
[25:29] like that. They just adopted that that
[25:32] that thinking. So that's what I I call
[25:36] in mind virus. It's the matrix is like
[25:38] staying in the system. It's it's more
[25:40] convenient just like going with the
[25:41] flow. I I get that. But stepping outside
[25:45] is just makes a lot of fun if if you're
[25:47] outside of that and then you all of the
[25:49] unquestioning things. So I think
[25:51] Bitcoiner because there's such a big
[25:53] thing breaking with with with money.
[25:56] They naturally question other things.
[25:58] But I catch myself also sometimes
[25:59] holding opinions that I just heard a lot
[26:01] but never question like it it still
[26:03] happens. I think this this idea of the
[26:05] mind virus, I find it really
[26:07] interesting. I was actually starting to
[26:08] throw together a bit of a presentation
[26:10] or like a slide deck for some talk in
[26:12] the future. I hadn't actually planned
[26:13] it. And it was this idea that there is
[26:17] this virus in cat feces called
[26:21] toxoplasma gandi. And what's really
[26:23] interesting is when mice come near the
[26:27] feces, they end up getting basically
[26:29] they take in or absorb this toxopasma
[26:31] gandi and this virus alters their brain
[26:36] towards being attracted towards uh cats.
[26:39] And so you'll see mice that will come
[26:41] out and walk straight in front of a cat.
[26:44] So the cat can basically go and eat it.
[26:45] And this mind virus has basically
[26:47] completely altered its ability to think
[26:49] for itself and to be able to assess
[26:52] risk. And what's interesting is I think
[26:54] our current monetary system, the fiat
[26:56] system, has done the exact same thing.
[26:58] It has put us into this state where all
[27:00] of a sudden we become so reliant on
[27:02] government that we're no longer thinking
[27:04] for ourselves. We're no longer being
[27:06] able to assess a situation and to be
[27:09] able to think from first principles and
[27:10] break things down. And so to your point,
[27:12] I find it really interesting because
[27:14] daytoday you have these conversations
[27:16] with individuals and they'll throw out a
[27:18] comment and you're like, "Huh, that's
[27:19] interesting. How did you come to that?"
[27:21] And you'll find their 30 steps up the
[27:24] ladder, but they can't explain the 30
[27:25] steps that got them up the ladder. And
[27:27] you're just like, "This is the world we
[27:29] live in today." They they up the ladder,
[27:31] but they don't know how they got
[27:32] actually
[27:33] there. It's like you you you trunk too
[27:36] much, you too much, and you actually
[27:38] don't know how you got home the entire
[27:39] day. Which raises an interesting
[27:42] question. When we are on a complete
[27:44] Bitcoin standard or we moving more and
[27:46] more towards that, how much central
[27:51] intervention should there be or what
[27:54] what kind of or is it just a free market
[27:57] that lives on its own or how do you look
[28:00] at how we organize ourselves on a
[28:02] Bitcoin standard? For sure. Um, so you
[28:06] know what? There's a book that I read
[28:07] during the pandemic that really stood
[28:09] out to me and it's a book called um the
[28:12] psychology of totalitarianism and one of
[28:14] the things it talks about is what is the
[28:16] environment which enables like
[28:19] authoritarian totalitarian environments
[28:21] to actually thrive and this guy looks
[28:23] all the way back throughout history. He
[28:25] goes through like Kiml son, Kim Jong-il,
[28:28] you look through Mao, you'll look
[28:30] through Stalin, you'll look through all
[28:31] of these various individuals that are
[28:32] led to these very controlling structures
[28:35] and there is a theme. There are four
[28:36] stages that take place. The first stage
[28:40] is in society there is meaninglessness
[28:44] and that is that people are struggling
[28:47] whether it's financially, they're
[28:49] struggling to feed their families,
[28:50] they're struggling to show up and so
[28:52] there's no meaning in life. They don't
[28:54] feel like they're able to actually like
[28:56] chart a course and try and reach some
[28:59] form of goal. They're simply existing.
[29:00] So life doesn't have meaning. The second
[29:03] stage is loneliness because they're
[29:05] having to work so much. Whether it's
[29:07] because they're in communism, whether
[29:08] it's because the environment, they're
[29:10] basically just trying to exist and
[29:11] survive. They're not able to spend time
[29:13] in community. They're not able to
[29:15] connect to the same extent, which leads
[29:17] to a whole heap of loneliness. The third
[29:19] stage is what's called free floating
[29:21] anxiety. Because life is so tough
[29:24] because they don't find meaning, because
[29:26] they're lonely, all of a sudden they
[29:28] start to have this free floating
[29:29] anxiety. But there's a difference
[29:31] between fixed anxiety, which is if I'm
[29:33] standing on top of a giant cliff face,
[29:35] there's a reason why I'm anxious. I have
[29:37] a something to fix my anxiety to. Free
[29:39] floating anxiety is I don't know like I
[29:42] just feel anxious all the time. I don't
[29:44] know why I'm feeling anxious and it's
[29:46] incredibly disorientating and
[29:48] debilitating because it's kind of like a
[29:50] full sense of anxiety but you can't
[29:52] really attach it to anything. And then
[29:54] the fourth stage is because there is
[29:56] meaninglessness, loneliness, anxiety,
[29:59] there tends to be a lot of frustration
[30:01] and anger. Now, when these four
[30:04] conditions are met, if you have a leader
[30:07] come out and say, "Hey, the reason why
[30:09] you're feeling anxious, the reason why
[30:11] you're feeling a sense of loneliness,
[30:13] and the reason why you're struggling is
[30:15] because of this entity or this group."
[30:18] We've seen this time and time and time
[30:20] again in North Korea. And uh we've seen
[30:22] it as capitalism is the enemy. Stalin
[30:25] again, capitalism with you could say
[30:28] Hitler, the Jewish population. like
[30:30] they've always had this enemy at which
[30:32] they have directed their energy towards
[30:34] and as a result you find society can
[30:37] quickly fall into what's called mass
[30:38] formation where people give up their
[30:40] values give up their beliefs because
[30:42] they believe that huh this individual is
[30:44] going to be able to fix me I'm going to
[30:46] be able to slowly move through these
[30:48] challenges that I've been facing and so
[30:50] we give up our moral values our
[30:52] integrity and people are willing to do
[30:54] wild things when they're in mass
[30:55] formation we saw it during the pandemic
[30:58] where people were basically isolating
[31:00] certain groups of the population because
[31:02] of certain beliefs they held. They
[31:03] weren't allowing them to go certain
[31:05] places. Like it's wild to see mass
[31:07] formation take place. Now in my book I
[31:10] add this one more condition for this to
[31:12] take place. That condition is condition
[31:15] zero which is a broken monetary system.
[31:18] For all of this to take place you have
[31:20] to have at least had a broken monetary
[31:22] system first. Because otherwise, if
[31:25] people actually have the ability to
[31:26] save, well, people have the ability to
[31:29] direct their capital towards what they
[31:30] see fit, to be able to think about the
[31:32] future, to be able to build a family. So
[31:34] that meaninglessness doesn't step in. On
[31:36] top of that, if people have capacity to
[31:38] save, well, all of a sudden, you have
[31:41] more capacity as your purchasing power
[31:43] increases to spend time in community. So
[31:45] that l loneliness never kind of kicks
[31:47] in. And so I think that our current
[31:49] system when we have a broken monetary
[31:51] system, it leads to a lot of these
[31:53] authoritarian totalitarian environments.
[31:56] And so it impacts people's ability
[31:59] because people are so focused on simply
[32:01] survival. It impacts people's ability to
[32:03] think for themselves. And so I think
[32:05] that we may have some form of
[32:07] centralization in the future. I don't
[32:09] know what that that future looks like.
[32:10] And this is kind of to answer your
[32:11] question. I don't know what that future
[32:13] looks like, whether we go into what some
[32:15] Bitcoiners believe is like anarchy where
[32:17] there's no government. It's just purely
[32:18] free market or whether we do still
[32:20] continue along a democratic process. But
[32:23] what I do believe is that with Bitcoin,
[32:26] if you have more capacity, then all of a
[32:28] sudden you have more ability to think
[32:30] for yourself and and think about the
[32:33] information at which we're consuming.
[32:34] And so if we have more ability to think
[32:36] for ourel and think about the
[32:37] information we're consuming, we can then
[32:39] look at those leaders in power and break
[32:41] down, huh, they're saying they want to
[32:43] do this, this, and this. Does that
[32:44] actually make sense? If I look at their
[32:47] historical track record, are they
[32:48] actually going to show up in that way?
[32:50] Historically, if they'd done this, this,
[32:51] and this, would it have panned out? And
[32:53] so I think we have a society that it's
[32:55] not that we may completely break down
[32:57] centralization, but is that by
[32:59] separating money from state and living
[33:01] on a Bitcoin standard, we have greater
[33:02] capacity to analyze the information
[33:04] we're consuming so that even if there is
[33:06] centralization, it doesn't lead to
[33:08] authoritarianism. It doesn't lead to
[33:10] these kind of like oppressive
[33:12] dictatorships and such and that I think
[33:14] is profound. I had an interesting
[33:15] thought uh when you explained the
[33:17] conditions of what what has to be met uh
[33:21] and then there's a leader coming in and
[33:23] we have one entity that we all uh rally
[33:27] behind like we we we put our anger
[33:30] behind that one enemy. I thought about
[33:33] oh like Bitcoin I do the same thing with
[33:34] with central banks but like the the the
[33:37] other conditions it just like it it hit
[33:39] me like oh yeah like but I guess you
[33:42] have I guess any
[33:45] movement no matter if it's a good or bad
[33:47] movement has to have some kind of enemy
[33:50] uh picture like thing absolutely and I
[33:54] think there's a difference between when
[33:57] we look at central banking we can if we
[34:00] break it down and look historically and
[34:01] look from where we've come from to where
[34:03] we are now, we can start to see cause
[34:05] and effect, the result of broken money
[34:08] leading to this, this, and this, and
[34:10] this, and leading to these symptoms
[34:11] throughout society. Whereas, I think the
[34:13] difference in totalitarianism is um you
[34:17] can create this fictional narrative that
[34:20] says this group or this individual is
[34:22] leading to all of your issues. And
[34:24] because people are so in their head,
[34:26] they're so struggling, they're just
[34:28] trying to exist, they don't have the
[34:29] capacity to actually determine, is that
[34:31] group actually causing these issues. All
[34:34] they want is I just want to be free from
[34:37] this pain. I just want to be free from
[34:39] what I'm going through. And so during CO
[34:42] we obviously and I don't want to get
[34:43] this um this podcast that's silenced on
[34:46] on YouTube but during CO there was a
[34:48] certain group of individuals that didn't
[34:50] take some form of medical uh trajectory
[34:54] and what we saw in the news is that
[34:56] group was vilified basically as if they
[34:58] were the ones that are causing
[34:59] everything. When you step back and you
[35:01] look at it that's not true in the
[35:03] slightest. Like now all the data has
[35:05] come out which says there's like that
[35:07] group if anything were the ones that
[35:09] were able to fight COVID their immune
[35:12] systems were able to stay strong and now
[35:14] the people that took the original
[35:15] trajectory are having a whole bunch of
[35:16] health issues and so what you start to
[35:18] realize is that a lot of totalitarianism
[35:21] authoritarianism is built on fear it's
[35:23] not built on truth and on top of that
[35:27] once that enemy like we see this with
[35:29] say Stalin with Stalin he ended up um
[35:33] directing his enemy towards the farmers.
[35:35] Well, by destroying the farmers, they
[35:37] had no food. So now they need to direct
[35:39] their energy towards something else. And
[35:40] so you keep rotating from enemy to enemy
[35:43] to enemy to enemy until eventually a
[35:45] totalitarian authoritarian environment
[35:48] eats itself. It completely destroys
[35:49] itself. They cannot last indefinitely
[35:52] into the future because they need to
[35:53] constantly be fixated on some form of
[35:56] enemy which is the reason why the
[35:58] populace is feeling all of these things
[35:59] that which they're feeling. And so
[36:01] that's why they're just not sustainable.
[36:02] They can't exist into the long term.
[36:04] They always break down. Let's take a
[36:06] break for a moment and appreciate the
[36:08] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[36:11] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[36:14] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[36:17] of showing that you are a true
[36:19] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[36:22] dropped a completely new and amazing
[36:25] Genesis edition of their watch
[36:27] collections. You have the date of the
[36:30] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[36:33] and of course also the block height and
[36:35] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[36:39] the level of detail they put in in this
[36:42] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[36:44] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[36:47] down in the descriptions. I love those
[36:49] watches so so much. And now if you have
[36:52] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[36:55] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[36:57] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[36:59] to deal with that. The first way is you
[37:02] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[37:04] entry for you to get into the
[37:06] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[37:10] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[37:12] super simple and secure way. And if you
[37:15] check out the link in the description,
[37:17] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[37:20] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[37:23] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[37:26] partner in terms of how to get the most
[37:29] out of your sovereignty. They will
[37:32] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[37:35] that is perfect for your individual
[37:38] situation. They will show you how you
[37:40] can secure your own devices. Securing
[37:43] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[37:45] have to keep all your devices secure.
[37:47] One topic that is overlooked often is
[37:49] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[37:52] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[37:55] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[37:57] place already? And last but not least,
[37:59] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[38:01] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[38:04] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[38:09] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[38:12] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[38:15] be for the first time ever speaking at
[38:17] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[38:20] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[38:23] really looking forward to seeing all of
[38:25] you there. You can get your ticket in
[38:27] the link down in the description of
[38:29] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[38:32] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[38:35] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[38:37] there. This is a really good point.
[38:38] Yeah, I I love that. One question, it
[38:42] raises me a lot and I flip-flopped on
[38:45] that like already two times. I was into
[38:48] politics a lot before Bitcoin. I was on
[38:51] uh in on a liberal uh party and I was
[38:54] really rallying be behind them. Now I'm
[38:56] actually completely out of that party
[38:58] and I had a when I started being in
[39:00] Bitcoin I started to being completely
[39:02] away from politics. So much so that
[39:06] people were talking about current events
[39:08] and I did not know anything like there
[39:11] there was some big thing happening in
[39:13] politics or news or in in the world and
[39:16] I couldn't like I didn't know know that
[39:18] about so for example right now it would
[39:20] be tariffs like there's tariffs from
[39:22] Trump coming like everyone talks about
[39:24] it it's like in the news cycle every day
[39:26] basically and uh back in the day I
[39:28] wouldn't wouldn't have known about it
[39:31] now I'm getting more into it again where
[39:34] I'm trying to keep up with what's going
[39:37] on within my jurisdiction just to see
[39:40] where is the direction going as in going
[39:43] in this direction or that direction and
[39:45] I'm voting uh which I also debated a lot
[39:48] should I vote should I not vote do I
[39:50] make the the system stronger or not and
[39:53] um I'm I'm curious to take get your take
[39:55] on that because first I thought I make
[39:58] the system stronger when I vote but then
[40:00] I also
[40:01] thought I rather have the least uh the
[40:07] least bad guy in there than let my vote
[40:12] go for waste and have the other ones
[40:14] take over. That is kind of my thought
[40:16] now of like okay if I'm not voting him
[40:19] because I would have voted him I make
[40:22] him automatically stronger with that.
[40:24] It's it's it's it's a a weird thing, but
[40:27] how do you look at voting and how much
[40:29] Bitcoiners should actually get in get
[40:31] into with politics? This is Oh man, I've
[40:34] had this conversation a few times over
[40:35] the last week just with friends. And
[40:37] it's such a challenging question because
[40:39] I think that as Bitcoiners, we think a
[40:42] lot about time preference. For those
[40:44] that aren't um conscious of what time
[40:46] preference is, like it's a spectrum. On
[40:48] one end, you've got high time
[40:49] preference, being impulsive, meeting my
[40:51] immediate needs right now. And then on
[40:53] the other side, you've got low time
[40:55] preference, thinking about the future,
[40:57] thinking about prosperity and security.
[41:00] And I think that when I think about
[41:03] voting, given that I don't agree with
[41:05] the system, as I mentioned previously,
[41:07] and I think the system itself is broken,
[41:10] and when we vote, we vote twice. We're
[41:12] voting once for the person, the party
[41:13] that we want in, and two, for the
[41:16] system. We're directing our energy
[41:17] towards the system. We're saying that I
[41:18] want the system to continue. And so
[41:20] there's a part of me that feels like,
[41:22] and this is my opinion, that it's high
[41:24] time preference thinking to vote if you
[41:28] don't believe in the system because it's
[41:30] just like, hey, yes, this party may be
[41:33] slightly better than that party. But in
[41:35] the grand scheme of things, I just don't
[41:36] agree with the system in general. And I
[41:38] think that the more individuals actually
[41:40] just step back energetically, take their
[41:43] spiritual energy out of the system and
[41:46] maybe direct it towards what it is they
[41:48] value, and in my case, in our case, I
[41:50] assume that thing is Bitcoin. Well, then
[41:52] what we're doing is we're directing our
[41:53] energy towards this thing that can
[41:54] actually make change. And the government
[41:57] if it exists on fiat currency it can
[41:59] keep on printing money but at a certain
[42:02] point if more and more people are
[42:03] drawing their energy out of the existing
[42:05] system and directing it towards Bitcoin
[42:07] Bitcoin's purchasing power is increasing
[42:09] or fiat currency they're having to
[42:10] continually intervene because they can't
[42:12] meet their fiscal responsibilities. Well
[42:14] it's a certain point the current system
[42:16] breaks down and the system has to
[42:18] recreate itself into a new functioning
[42:21] system. But under this system, I would
[42:22] argue that the money would be separate
[42:24] from state, which then realines all the
[42:26] incentives again. And so I think
[42:28] long-term, I believe that it's about
[42:31] thinking about where we want to direct
[42:33] our energy and what makes the most sense
[42:35] as opposed to existing in this current
[42:37] system being like, "Oh, I believe in
[42:38] Bitcoin over here, but I'm existing in
[42:40] this current system, which is not
[42:41] serving us." And I know Jeff Booth talks
[42:44] about it when he is on podcasts and he
[42:46] says for a long time I was very pro
[42:48] Bitcoin but I spent 99% of my time in my
[42:52] fiat businesses and it's just like what
[42:54] am I doing if I want this thing to
[42:56] actually change I got to direct my time
[42:57] and energy towards the area of my life
[42:59] which I want to change which is Bitcoin.
[43:01] And then he left all his fiat businesses
[43:03] put managers in place for those to kind
[43:05] of take care of the business so he can
[43:07] direct his energy towards Bitcoin. And
[43:08] of course that's a I don't want to sway
[43:10] anyone. This is my personal belief. I
[43:12] think that everyone needs to make that
[43:14] decision for themselves. And I totally
[43:15] understand that there's a rational
[43:17] argument to say, "Hey, this party is way
[43:19] better than that party in the short
[43:21] term, so I'm going to vote them just
[43:22] because I don't want my vote to go to
[43:24] waste." I understand that argument. I
[43:26] just wonder if it is a high time
[43:28] preference thinking as opposed to that
[43:30] low time preference, how do we actually
[43:32] transition in the long term to a better
[43:33] system?
[43:35] That's super interesting. When you talk
[43:37] about the system, do you mean
[43:41] democracy directly or do you mean more
[43:43] broadly the the money printer and then
[43:47] the power structures around that on like
[43:50] a more broad scale? That's a it's a
[43:53] really good question because I think
[43:54] that I think there's two aspects. First,
[43:57] I think that our system, if we were to
[43:59] simply remove the monetary system from
[44:02] the state and our current like
[44:03] democratic process that exists in most
[44:05] nations, I think that that alone would
[44:08] realign a lot of the incentives of the
[44:10] system because I think again if a
[44:12] government can fund itself without
[44:14] support from the populace by simply
[44:15] hitting print on the printer, well then
[44:18] they have no obligation to actually
[44:20] create value. If you own a small little
[44:22] business and in the back office you have
[44:24] a money printer, do you actually have to
[44:26] create products that create value? No,
[44:27] you don't. And so I think that what
[44:30] separating money from state does is it
[44:32] holds the government accountable to
[44:33] listening to the populace. So that's
[44:35] kind of the first step. But
[44:37] secondly, I am
[44:40] increasingly of the belief that the
[44:43] democratic process is flawed. And as for
[44:46] what we actually need, I'm not 100%
[44:49] sure. So, I don't want to claim that I'm
[44:50] kind of an expert in this area or I have
[44:52] an answer to this, but I think the
[44:54] democratic process doesn't support
[44:56] accountability given that you can have a
[44:58] party that come into power, they can
[45:00] make all of these changes, completely
[45:02] destroy the nation, make them hugely
[45:05] indebted, lead to all of this social
[45:07] unrest, and then they can just be like,
[45:09] "Oh, well, I'm just going to resign and
[45:12] there's no repercussions." And on top of
[45:14] that, I find what's really interesting
[45:16] is that politicians to become a
[45:18] politician, you need a certain skill.
[45:20] That skill is the skill of persuasion
[45:23] and the skill of communication. You need
[45:25] to be able to express your ideas and
[45:26] communicate them effectively. But the
[45:28] reality is that usually the salesperson
[45:32] is not the individual that understands
[45:35] the system deeply and is the one that
[45:37] actually is able to invent change and
[45:39] think about a new trajectory. And as a
[45:42] result, we end up with a whole bunch of
[45:44] politicians, salespeople selling
[45:46] products which they don't understand.
[45:48] And you just need to look at say the US
[45:50] system where politicians are willing to
[45:52] sign bills when they've never even read
[45:54] the bill. And so they're supporting
[45:56] things they don't even understand. And
[45:58] the last thing I'll mention is that um
[46:01] we have a democratic voting system
[46:04] whereby individuals are voting on
[46:07] political parties when they've done zero
[46:09] research and have no understanding about
[46:11] who that political party is. And I was
[46:13] thinking about this yesterday because
[46:14] we're coming into the election. As I
[46:16] drive down the roads, there's all of the
[46:18] signs in people's lawns. There's all of
[46:19] the vote left, vote right, vote left,
[46:22] vote right. And what they're trying to
[46:24] do is dissuade people to vote left or
[46:25] right. Oh, I think the leader of the
[46:27] left party is this. I'm just going to go
[46:29] to the ballot and vote left. But you're
[46:31] voting for something that you have no
[46:32] understanding about. You're not looked
[46:33] into their policies. You don't really
[46:35] understand what their agenda is. And
[46:37] there's not much transparency in that
[46:39] either and who their affiliated parties
[46:41] are, whether they're part of the World
[46:42] Economic Forum. And so, I think that we
[46:44] have a system that you're giving average
[46:46] people the ability to vote for change
[46:49] when they don't have the capacity to go
[46:51] and research what that change actually
[46:53] means. And oh there's one more point
[46:55] I'll add which is anytime a new product
[46:59] has ever come into uh the kind of the
[47:03] the world let's take like Apple envision
[47:06] something that the world needed and as a
[47:09] result they brought a product into this
[47:11] world but if you had voted on that
[47:14] people likely would have voted no
[47:16] because they can't envision the future
[47:20] they can only envision what they have
[47:21] experienced themselves when BlackBerry
[47:25] uh had the the keypad what the the
[47:27] fulllength keypad and Apple brought in
[47:30] the iPhone which was touch initially if
[47:33] you'd done a poll with people in the
[47:34] world do you prefer the keypad or do you
[47:36] want touch the majority of people said I
[47:39] don't want touch I want a physical
[47:41] keypad I like the tactile feel of a
[47:42] keypad but then the iPhone came out and
[47:45] within like 2 or 3 years BlackBerry had
[47:46] basically gone under and so people are
[47:49] very resistant to change they can't
[47:51] think about the future they struggle to
[47:52] think about the future. And so because
[47:54] of that, a voting system that gives
[47:57] power to individuals to think about the
[47:59] future is usually not going to actually
[48:02] create the change necessary which is
[48:04] needed to actually alter our current
[48:07] course. And so I kind of like jumbled
[48:09] through a couple of those, but I I
[48:11] really believe that our current system,
[48:12] the incentives aren't necessarily
[48:13] aligned. There's not much accountability
[48:16] on behalf of the politicians themselves.
[48:18] The politicians themselves many times
[48:20] are just sales individuals. they don't
[48:22] understand the actual problems deeply.
[48:24] And then lastly, you're giving power to
[48:26] individuals that aren't willing to do
[48:28] the research. So, they're voting on
[48:29] things they don't understand. And I
[48:30] think that that's where I tend to think
[48:32] the democratic process is flawed in a
[48:34] sense. As for what is better, that's a
[48:37] tough call. It it's Yeah, it's a really
[48:40] tough call. And I love the
[48:42] accountability part because I'm I'm not
[48:44] into like I'm not a long time on this
[48:47] earth. I'm just 26 years old. And uh I
[48:50] talked with Tom Strollard actually
[48:52] around that topic because he he had an
[48:56] interesting uh position. He's like I
[48:58] have no hope for that system but I'm
[49:00] still going to I'm still going to vote.
[49:02] Um the the the point he was making uh he
[49:06] saw it since what was he saying 40 or 50
[49:09] years something like that and he always
[49:11] was like oh like they doing so bad
[49:13] there's this new guy has a great ideas
[49:15] I'm voting for him. And then he came in
[49:17] like oh like okay he turns out to be
[49:19] also an and he doesn't do
[49:21] anything then he votes a new guy in and
[49:23] this he saw it over all of his his life
[49:26] for like 40 50 years where he always
[49:28] voted an a great guy in and he turned
[49:31] out to be an just like the
[49:33] previous guy and I'm already seeing that
[49:37] in my very short life where I can vote
[49:39] now since like five six seven years I
[49:42] don't know something like that or no
[49:43] like actually a little bit uh earlier I
[49:45] I could have started of 16. I I think I
[49:47] started voting with 18. Uh so I can now
[49:50] vote since 10 years and I've seen that
[49:53] they come in, they praise a lot and then
[49:57] nothing really happens. I mean there's
[49:59] always a compromise things but what
[50:01] really bothers me is the accountability.
[50:03] We have one party that has been in the
[50:06] government since the last 40 years.
[50:08] sometimes as the leading party,
[50:09] sometimes as the uh smaller party in
[50:12] Austria we have five different parties
[50:14] and they are now saying oh like we we
[50:17] have to save and I'm like who who spent
[50:20] the
[50:21] money who was in power? They they had
[50:24] the the finance minister since over 30
[50:27] years and now they're saying like oh we
[50:30] have to save and I'm like yeah but like
[50:32] who who who gave the money out? So I I
[50:35] get your point about accountability that
[50:37] that really something if there's a CFO
[50:40] in a company that just makes minus after
[50:43] minus after minus he gets thrown out
[50:46] probably after like latest two years
[50:48] probably in the first year if he handles
[50:50] the company right. So yeah it's it's
[50:52] it's it's a it's a tough tough topic
[50:55] with accountability. One thing I'm um
[50:57] also struggling with is how much do you
[51:00] keep up with with news? How much do you
[51:03] pay attention to what Trump is doing
[51:06] with tariffs and and and and kind of the
[51:08] what the system is doing? Maybe also for
[51:11] your uh jurisdiction where taxes are
[51:15] going, where uh bureaucracy is going and
[51:17] those things. Do you have like a
[51:19] framework of like okay once a week I
[51:21] look into things or something like that?
[51:22] You know what I'd say? it es and flows
[51:24] and you and I had this conversation uh
[51:27] just before we jumped on the call which
[51:29] is this idea of learning and digging
[51:32] into history and I think that it's so
[51:36] important to read up on history to
[51:39] understand how previous uh whether it's
[51:43] political parties or whether it's nation
[51:45] states have approached civilization and
[51:49] society and what their downfall has been
[51:52] and that gives you much greater insight
[51:54] into the political parties that are
[51:55] running today and the trajectory at
[51:57] which we're on. And I think a lot of
[51:59] these policies sound great on paper.
[52:02] They sound awesome on paper. Hey, I want
[52:04] to protect the environment. So, I'm just
[52:05] going to stop all basically energy
[52:08] production. Cool. That's great. Except
[52:09] for the fact that we live in a world
[52:10] where we need energy and GDP and energy
[52:13] are very much intertwined. And so, if
[52:16] you cut energy production, you're just
[52:17] going to hugely impact your nation
[52:19] state. And so I think that policies on
[52:22] paper sound great. And again, going back
[52:24] to that point, the average individual
[52:25] doesn't do research. So because they
[52:28] don't do research, they're swayed by
[52:29] what a policy feels as opposed to what a
[52:32] policy is actually going to do. And so I
[52:34] think that doing research is so so
[52:36] important, historical research. As for
[52:39] the news, I think that it's a
[52:41] challenging one. I find that with social
[52:44] media today, we're seeing the news from
[52:47] all over the world. We're seeing what's
[52:48] happening in Europe. We're seeing what's
[52:49] happening in freaking Africa. We're
[52:50] seeing what's happening in the US. And
[52:52] it becomes very overwhelming. And I've
[52:55] always been interested in health and
[52:57] psychology. And when we become
[52:59] overwhelmed and our body goes into some
[53:01] of our stress response systems, fight,
[53:03] flight, freeze, all of a sudden we're
[53:05] flooded with stress hormones, cortisol,
[53:08] epinephrine, adrenaline. These stress
[53:10] hormones hugely impact our nervous
[53:13] system. And our nervous system and
[53:15] immune system are intimately linked. And
[53:17] so when we're stressed repeatedly, it
[53:20] leads to higher rates of allergies,
[53:22] again, higher rates of depression,
[53:24] anxiety, substance abuse, all of these
[53:27] things, which is, I would argue, why
[53:28] we're feeling the issues that we're
[53:29] feeling in society today. And so I'm
[53:32] very conscious of the amount of time I
[53:34] spend on social media, in the news,
[53:37] because it makes it feel like the world
[53:39] is breaking down. everything is like
[53:41] freaking it's it's hell right now and
[53:43] there's rioting here and there's there's
[53:45] distrust here and there's so much social
[53:47] tension and it's really easy to get
[53:49] stuck in these uh stress response
[53:51] systems and so I would say that although
[53:53] yes I use social media and predominant
[53:56] Twitter is pretty much the only thing
[53:58] that I use I'm very conscious of how
[53:59] much time I spend on it and I would
[54:01] rather spend time reading up on history
[54:04] reading up on uh long form content
[54:07] because I think that the longer
[54:09] something has taken to create the more
[54:12] informative it is or usually the pro the
[54:15] higher probability of it being more
[54:17] informative. Um and on top of that like
[54:19] when you read a book someone's may have
[54:22] put their whole life's work into that
[54:23] book. So you can gain such depth of
[54:25] knowledge whereas a small Twitter post
[54:28] or a news article there's not much depth
[54:30] there. Someone can just throw it out
[54:32] there. They can even delete it if they
[54:33] were wrong. And so I think that news is
[54:36] oftentimes very misleading and doesn't
[54:38] actually give an accurate representation
[54:40] of what is actually taking place. I
[54:42] think that to get an accurate
[54:43] representation, read history and then uh
[54:45] have a look at our current trajectory
[54:47] and that will give you a better
[54:48] representation.
[54:50] Yeah, we we talked about that before and
[54:52] it's it's such an interesting topic
[54:54] because I I I told you before we we
[54:56] started Bitcoin made me excited about
[54:59] history again. I I never looked into
[55:01] history and because of Bitcoin I looked
[55:03] into the steam engine printing press
[55:05] like looked into uh wars I looked into
[55:07] revolutions like what what was going on
[55:09] why what was this happening why was uh
[55:12] history going in the one direction or in
[55:14] the other direction how has Bitcoin kind
[55:17] of impacted your approach to learning in
[55:20] general oh man I think this is this
[55:22] question doesn't come up enough and I
[55:24] think that it is profound because I
[55:25] think I mentioned it very briefly
[55:26] earlier but one of the coolest things
[55:28] about Bitcoin is they're curious And so
[55:30] you go down this rabbit hole of Bitcoin.
[55:31] And then it starts to open up all of
[55:33] these other avenues because for me, I
[55:36] was always interested in psychology. I
[55:38] was always interested in sports and kind
[55:40] of human biology. I was always
[55:41] interested in the financial markets. Um,
[55:43] but what I didn't realize is that all of
[55:46] these things are interconnected. And so
[55:48] that's arguably why I wrote The Hidden
[55:50] Cost of Money is because I realized that
[55:52] when money breaks down, it impacts
[55:55] everything. you you I very much notice
[55:58] that everything is downstream of money.
[56:00] When our purchasing power starts to
[56:01] degrade, well, all of a sudden parents
[56:03] have to work more. If parents have to
[56:04] work more, well, that impacts their
[56:06] ability to shop for their kids. Same
[56:08] thing. If purchasing power is degrading,
[56:10] people are incentivized to consume over
[56:12] save. So, you end up with a very
[56:14] consumption-based economy that is
[56:15] completely impacting our natural
[56:17] environment because what when we
[56:19] consume, we need resources. Resources
[56:20] come out of the forests, the waterways,
[56:22] the ground. So we've got a very
[56:24] destructive society right now as a
[56:26] result of our consumption habits. And
[56:27] the same thing in business and politics.
[56:29] Broken money leads to authoritarianism,
[56:31] totalitarianism. And so I very much
[56:34] believe everything is downstream of
[56:35] money. But it wasn't until I went down
[56:37] Bitcoin that I started to really connect
[56:39] the dots between all of these different
[56:41] areas. And so I think that like when it
[56:43] comes
[56:44] to learning, I have just been so blown
[56:48] away
[56:50] by just to what extent money touches
[56:53] every facet of every facet of life and
[56:56] just to I think it's fascinating that
[56:58] curiosity when I went through school
[57:00] when I was a early teenager. I dropped
[57:02] out of school when I was 14 years old. I
[57:04] I hated school. I really did not enjoy
[57:07] school and I felt that it didn't support
[57:10] curiosity. Instead, it was trying to
[57:12] teach a very structured, regimented
[57:14] approach to how the world works. And it
[57:17] wasn't until I left school that actually
[57:19] I found, huh, I'm not dumb. I'm not
[57:21] thick. I just needed to find things that
[57:22] I'm curious about. And all of a sudden
[57:24] once I learned how to learn, once I
[57:27] became way more proficient in reading
[57:29] and I would say one of the biggest
[57:31] things is once I was able to listen to
[57:33] books, it completely changed my life. I
[57:36] remember reading at one point about this
[57:37] kind of listening to books that
[57:40] um our brain when we read we sub
[57:43] vocalize. We say the words on the page
[57:46] in our head and we listen to the words
[57:47] and this sub vocalization is two steps
[57:49] to actually consuming the content.
[57:51] Whereas listening, you're not having to
[57:53] read. You're basically just listening to
[57:54] the words. It's being consumed. It's
[57:56] only one step. So our brain, if we're
[57:58] able to stay focused, is far more
[57:59] efficient at listening than it is
[58:01] reading. And so once I was able to
[58:02] listen to audio books, once I was able
[58:04] to convert text to speech, it completely
[58:07] changed my world in terms of my ability
[58:08] to learn. Yeah, I I I completely
[58:11] switched to audio books. I I I can read,
[58:16] but I always wander off like I I cannot.
[58:19] And with audiobook, I just like I could
[58:21] be hours on on it. I I I have problems
[58:24] getting away sometimes. It's also, I
[58:27] think, an aspect that often gets
[58:29] overlooked. An aspect that actually made
[58:32] this podcast possible when I went and
[58:35] actually Jeff Poof, you talked about it
[58:37] like he had this realization 99% of his
[58:39] life is still in fear and then he
[58:40] switched to Bitcoin and he said the same
[58:42] thing on my first podcast with him and I
[58:44] kind of realized, oh like I have a
[58:47] Bitcoin podcast. I uh am all in Bitcoin
[58:50] and and I have to I'm still working like
[58:53] 40 hours a week on on on a fiat system
[58:56] and this and the financial safety that I
[59:01] had from Bitcoin where I'm like okay if
[59:03] it really doesn't go anywhere I can
[59:05] support myself over a few months maybe
[59:08] on on my Bitcoin stack and can live off
[59:10] that and don't have to directly go into
[59:14] I don't know my parents home again or
[59:16] bankruptcy or whatever. I can support
[59:18] myself a few months and see where this
[59:21] uh road leaves me. And so, Bitcoin
[59:24] enabled me to start this podcast. And
[59:27] luckily, I never had to take anything
[59:28] out for that. But it also enables anyone
[59:32] to actually take time out and learn
[59:35] again because you said the the the thing
[59:37] that that keeps people moving in in that
[59:40] red race and you really like go about
[59:42] your day and you don't really have a a
[59:44] brain for uh getting anything outside of
[59:47] your work and family in in your brain.
[59:50] Bitcoin gives you the time bag of like
[59:52] hey let's read that book on a Sunday
[59:55] morning. Let's read that book. Maybe
[59:57] maybe 40 hours uh because of my Bitcoin
[60:01] stack. Like someone saved maybe 10 years
[60:03] now of of his life in in Bitcoin. Now
[60:05] he's able to um not work 40 hours and go
[60:10] back to 20 hours. And the 20 hours he
[60:12] uses to study and to read books and to
[60:15] listen to books and and go about his
[60:17] life or make more time with with a
[60:20] family. So, I think that that's an
[60:21] underrated aspect of Bitcoin, how it can
[60:24] give us time back and give more life
[60:27] into um into into our life with Bitcoin.
[60:31] Oh man, I couldn't agree more. And one
[60:33] thing that I've actually noticed and
[60:35] it's a shift that's taking place like I
[60:37] ended up going a little too heavy into
[60:39] the listening to books and I started
[60:42] setting goals and I actually moved away
[60:43] from that. I started setting goals. I
[60:45] was like, okay, you know what? I think
[60:46] it was maybe 2020. I was like, I want to
[60:48] read 52 books in a year, one book a
[60:51] week. And so I went down that rabbit
[60:52] hole. And then I was like, you know
[60:53] what? I want to read 100 books in a
[60:55] year. So then I read 100 books in a
[60:56] year. And I think I got up to like in
[60:58] one year, I think I ended up reading
[60:59] like 134 books or something. And I was
[61:02] just like, what am I doing? Like I am
[61:04] consuming all this information, but am I
[61:07] really contemplating the information? Am
[61:10] I integrating that information? And is
[61:12] it kind of am I storing it alongside
[61:14] this information or am I just kind of
[61:16] consuming information for the sake of
[61:18] consuming information? And so I've
[61:20] noticed in the last three or four years
[61:22] that my information consumption has
[61:25] slowed down and I'm now on probably like
[61:29] 15 to 25 books a year. But what I'm
[61:31] noticing is that I'm spending way more
[61:33] time with the books and I'm also
[61:35] thinking about them a lot more because I
[61:37] think it's one thing for consuming
[61:39] information for information's sake. It's
[61:41] another thing to consume information and
[61:44] integrate it and think how does this fit
[61:46] in to the my current view on the world
[61:49] and maybe these other books that I've
[61:51] read. And so I think that it's really
[61:53] important to contemplate the information
[61:55] we're consuming and not just consume for
[61:57] the sake of consumption. And I think
[61:58] that the other point that I'll make on
[62:00] that is that for me what has made such a
[62:03] huge difference in my uh consumption and
[62:07] integration of knowledge is notetaking.
[62:10] And so I use an app called Obsidian.
[62:12] It's kind of a free open- source
[62:14] software. Um, and it is absolutely
[62:17] profound. And it's this idea that
[62:18] humans, we have a phenomenal ability to
[62:22] connect the dots between two abstract
[62:24] ideas and be like, "Huh, I'm interested
[62:26] in this and I'm interested in this. I
[62:28] wonder if I can create a product that
[62:30] combines this and this." And you create
[62:31] a new product. We're amazing at these
[62:33] abstract creative ideas. What humans
[62:36] aren't that good at is thinking and
[62:38] storing specific information and
[62:40] details, remembering numbers,
[62:42] remembering dates of things, exactly
[62:44] when things happened. And this is why
[62:46] like in a a court of law with eyewitness
[62:48] testimony after 7 years, it's like
[62:50] invalid because people our mind is
[62:52] constantly changing. Our ability to
[62:54] remember things is shifting. And so
[62:55] we're not that good at remembering
[62:57] specific facts. We're really good at
[62:58] piecing together dots. And so when I
[63:00] started create when I started notetaking
[63:03] all of a sudden it allowed me to unload
[63:06] all of the specific information and to
[63:09] really just think about the narrative
[63:11] the overarching narrative of these books
[63:13] and so piece together my world view more
[63:15] easily. And when it came to actually
[63:17] using that information, such as writing
[63:19] a book, all of a sudden I had 500 plus
[63:22] books that I had notes on and I was able
[63:25] to site all of them word for word on
[63:27] these specific paragraphs or things that
[63:28] stood out to me. And that profoundly
[63:31] changed my life taking notes on things.
[63:33] And the final point on note-taking that
[63:35] really kind of made a huge difference is
[63:37] that many times I think we're taught
[63:39] from school to take notes on like, okay,
[63:42] when I'm reading this book, chapter one,
[63:44] this is what chapter one is about.
[63:45] Chapter two. This is what chapter two is
[63:47] about. These are the important points.
[63:48] That's such a poor way of taking notes.
[63:50] The reality is that if you want notes to
[63:52] work effectively, what you have to do is
[63:54] you have to take notes on things that
[63:56] interest you and stand out to you. So,
[63:58] what I'll do is as I'm reading through a
[63:59] book, I'll be like, "Oh my god, that is
[64:01] fascinating." I'll take that and I'll
[64:04] take note of it. And then by the time I
[64:06] finish the book, what I'll do is I'll
[64:07] read through all of those notes that
[64:09] I've taken and I will first bold all the
[64:12] ones that were like, "That's meaningful.
[64:14] That is huge. And then what I'll do is
[64:16] go through a second round and all the
[64:18] ones that were bold, if I found not only
[64:21] is that meaningful, that is profound.
[64:23] I've never thought about this in that
[64:25] way, I will then expand on it in my own
[64:27] words. And so in doing so, this
[64:30] three-step process of first taking notes
[64:32] on things that interest you from the
[64:33] book. Secondly, bolding the ones that
[64:35] stand out and third expanding on the
[64:38] ones that are profound. What that does
[64:40] is it integrates this knowledge into
[64:42] your current understanding. And by
[64:43] putting it into your own words, you're
[64:45] deepening your understanding of these
[64:47] things. And so I found taking notes on
[64:49] books and then approaching it from this
[64:50] method profoundly improved my
[64:53] understanding of the world and piecing
[64:54] together this puzzle of how I think the
[64:56] world works. Love
[64:58] that. There's so many people say take
[65:01] notes, but I never took notes because I
[65:04] was like, "Oh, like what should I do if
[65:05] there's notes? I'm just writing down
[65:06] what I think because it I I don't know.
[65:09] I I don't care go after like two years
[65:11] back in the notes and if I do I probably
[65:14] don't even know why I took this note and
[65:16] stuff like that. But with that you
[65:18] immediately get it in you because you
[65:20] thought about why it was profound for
[65:22] you and you write it out in in your own
[65:24] words. That that's what I what I
[65:26] currently do with with Bitcoin related
[65:29] content. But I when I read uh outside of
[65:33] Bitcoin I actually don't do that. I only
[65:35] do it with Bitcoin things actually
[65:36] because with Bitcoin things I have like
[65:38] um I have lists and and places where
[65:41] things go. So if I found something very
[65:43] interesting, no matter if I read in a
[65:44] book, if I hear it from a um from a
[65:47] podcast, I I literally just write down
[65:50] like he said that at that podcast at
[65:52] that
[65:53] minute and what it is. So later I can go
[65:57] back and and see it actually. and it's
[65:59] kind of a to-do list of things I I can
[66:01] look through to get inspiration for
[66:04] articles, tweets, uh or the book that I
[66:07] I might write. So that there's a lot of
[66:09] things uh in that. But taking notes in
[66:12] this three-step process of what is
[66:15] interesting, then trying to figure out
[66:17] okay, what is profound about that? And
[66:19] then the third step is basically writing
[66:21] in your own words why and and and
[66:23] extending on that idea is really I think
[66:26] the the the last step actually is for me
[66:28] the the most important one because then
[66:30] you really think about it before you
[66:32] okay that is interesting get it out oh
[66:35] that's really interesting I make it bold
[66:36] but then extending on that that that's
[66:39] brilliant I never heard that thank you
[66:40] so much for me as well there's there's
[66:43] something else which is really important
[66:45] which is when we take notes in isolation
[66:47] I used to take notes just through the
[66:49] Apple Note app. Anytime I read a book, I
[66:51] take notes. The problem with that is
[66:53] each note stacks on top of one another.
[66:55] So 3 years later, you're just like, "Oh
[66:57] man, I read that book, but I can't
[66:59] remember that book. What was ah frig, I
[67:02] can't remember it, and it's gone. You've
[67:03] you've lost that information. You're
[67:05] probably never going to find it again."
[67:06] And so it's also important to be able to
[67:09] retrieve that information easily. And so
[67:12] what I try to do is I structure my notes
[67:14] in a way that allows me to locate notes
[67:17] in the future and it's also really not
[67:20] only is it important to structure your
[67:21] notes and have tags like okay this book
[67:23] is about these subjects. So it's really
[67:25] easy for me to be like huh there was
[67:27] that book about psychology that touched
[67:28] on these subjects and then I can go and
[67:30] search up psychology in my notes and I
[67:32] can go and find that book. But when I'm
[67:35] actually going through um reading a book
[67:38] and taking notes on that book, if
[67:40] something sparks like, "Huh, this
[67:42] paragraph in this book reminds me of
[67:44] this book and this book was really
[67:46] profound." Connect those two dots in the
[67:49] note. And what you're doing is you're
[67:51] actually effectively uh you're mimicking
[67:53] the brain. You're creating neural
[67:55] pathways between pieces of information.
[67:57] And so you're basically saying, huh,
[67:58] this book has taught me about this, but
[68:01] it reminds me of this book where it also
[68:03] expands on it here. And so I link those
[68:05] two notes. And I don't I can show very
[68:07] briefly. I don't know if I'm able to
[68:08] share here. Uh, you should be able to
[68:11] share if the browser has the permission
[68:13] to share. Okay. Yeah, I think I can
[68:15] share here. Uh, can you see my screen
[68:17] right now? Yes, I see it. So this Can
[68:20] you see my note takingaking app? So this
[68:23] mimics the brain. every single one of
[68:25] these little dots. And for those that
[68:26] are listening uh as opposed to viewing
[68:28] this, there's basically a whole bunch of
[68:30] dots that look like little signapses on
[68:32] a brain. And then when you hover over,
[68:33] the bigger the dot, the more connection
[68:35] points it's got. And so, for instance, I
[68:36] can hover hover over this one and it
[68:39] says spirituality. It shows all of the
[68:41] notes that I have taken that I've tagged
[68:43] with spirituality. And so, each of those
[68:45] points represents something that I
[68:47] believe ties back to spirituality. But
[68:49] again, it's really important to be able
[68:50] to actually locate notes. And so for me,
[68:53] you have an index page. I can click on
[68:56] various interest types, content types,
[68:58] and I can go down to say books and I can
[69:01] go to my fivestar rated books. And then
[69:03] I can go into like any of these books.
[69:04] Atomic Habits by James Clear, Becoming
[69:07] the One by Shayana. Let's click on
[69:09] Atomic Habits. And then you see all of
[69:10] the notes and breaking these down. And
[69:13] you can see the ones that I've bolded.
[69:15] And in this one, I don't have any links
[69:16] to other things, but it's just having a
[69:19] structured note takingaking app or
[69:21] approach profoundly changes your ability
[69:24] to create content and to distill content
[69:26] that you've learned about. That is Wow.
[69:29] I love that. It looks like a world map.
[69:30] Honestly, it looks like your own uh mind
[69:33] world of all your thoughts and all your
[69:35] ideas. Oh man, it's to me it's
[69:38] completely changed my life because I
[69:40] know that there's a couple individuals
[69:41] that refer to it by this, but it's kind
[69:43] of like my second brain. I have my
[69:45] internal brain which is obviously
[69:47] storing all of my creative ideas and my
[69:49] rough idea or structure of how I think
[69:51] the world works. And then there's my
[69:53] second brain which has got all of the
[69:55] details from all of the books that I've
[69:57] read throughout my life that I've taken
[69:58] notes on that I can reference at any
[70:01] time and it's easy for me to pull that
[70:03] information from. And so those two
[70:05] brains in concert with one another
[70:08] massively amplify my ability to show up
[70:10] in this world to create content to write
[70:11] books. And that's the only reason why at
[70:13] the end of the hidden cost of money my
[70:15] book I think there's something like 500
[70:18] citations. And the only reason why I
[70:20] have that is because by the time I
[70:21] actually went to go write the book I had
[70:24] 10 years of notes that I was able to
[70:26] pull from and be like huh this paragraph
[70:28] and this point and this thing I was able
[70:30] to pull from them and cite them. And so
[70:31] it profoundly changed my life once I
[70:33] started taking notes.
[70:35] So you're listening to audio books and
[70:38] uh you are you sitting down or you
[70:40] walking around like how do you usually
[70:42] listen to books? So I this this is
[70:46] probably the most profound if I was to
[70:48] say if there was one app that has
[70:50] changed my life. There is an app called
[70:52] Voice Dream Reader. And I've freaking
[70:55] shared this app a million times. I just
[70:56] think it's incredible. Voice Dream
[70:58] Reader. I think it's now um it's like a
[71:00] subscription thing. It used to be like a
[71:01] one-off payment. But anyway, what Voice
[71:04] Dream Reader does is you can put any
[71:06] ebook, whether it's an EPUB, whether
[71:08] it's a PDF, you can share web pages into
[71:11] it. You can share text documents,
[71:13] anything that has got a text, and then
[71:15] it will read that text to you. You can
[71:17] select the voice. And now, I think in
[71:19] the newest versions, it's actually got
[71:20] AI voices, so it's way better. It's not
[71:22] as robotic. And it will read it to you.
[71:25] But what's interesting is the screen
[71:27] you'll have, it will highlight where you
[71:29] are in the text as it's reading it to
[71:30] you. So I can go and walk through the
[71:32] forest and listen. And at the same time,
[71:35] if it says something that I'm like, "Oh
[71:37] my god, that's amazing. I want to quote
[71:39] that because it's following along with
[71:40] the text, I can copy and paste the text
[71:42] into my note, and I have the exact quote
[71:45] word for word in text as well as
[71:47] listening to it." And so Voice Dream
[71:48] Reader I've probably been using for
[71:50] about seven, eight years now. And Voice
[71:52] Dream Reader, if there's one app that I
[71:54] recommend, profoundly profoundly changed
[71:56] my life. Like profoundly.
[71:58] Wow. I love that. So you so you buy or
[72:02] get the ebook from from the internet and
[72:04] then you put it in there. I I heard
[72:06] about speechify. I think that's that's a
[72:08] app that also does similar thing. Yeah,
[72:10] they do they do similar things as well.
[72:12] And um I think this is speechify it's
[72:14] good. I find that VoiceCreen reader is
[72:16] more specific to content consumption um
[72:19] and long form content like putting I can
[72:22] put in any ebook, any PDF straight in
[72:25] there and uh you can just follow along
[72:27] and read the ebook as if you normally
[72:29] would or you can go for a walk. And so I
[72:31] find I have a dog, I have a husky, I
[72:33] probably spend a few hours a day every
[72:35] day walking through the forest. And I
[72:37] also find that moving, getting blood
[72:39] flow while you're listening, while
[72:41] you're learning amplifies the ability to
[72:44] uh absorb knowledge. If I'm sat
[72:46] sedentary and my blood is not flowing,
[72:48] my heart isn't beating to the same
[72:49] extent, I find it a lot harder to
[72:51] consume knowledge. So once I start
[72:52] walking in the forest in a grounding
[72:54] area, I can't just go walk in the city.
[72:56] If I'm walking in the forest in a
[72:57] grounded area, I'm not having to
[72:59] interact. I find that's the best place
[73:01] to absorb knowledge. Uh do do you do
[73:04] this multiple times a day or like to
[73:06] like one really long three-hour walk.
[73:09] Well, I usually walk in the morning with
[73:10] the dog, midday with the dog, and in the
[73:12] evening with the dog. And then like to
[73:14] your point, I also listen to books when
[73:16] I'm if I'm driving like I live about an
[73:18] hour and a half from Vancouver. And so
[73:20] to drive down to Vancouver on the
[73:22] highway, I just chuck a book on and I'm
[73:24] listening to a book. And I find that the
[73:25] average individual is they usually say,
[73:27] "I don't have time to learn. I don't
[73:29] have time to research. I don't have time
[73:30] to do these things. And then you realize
[73:32] actually, cool, you've got like 30, 40
[73:34] minutes while you're making dinner.
[73:36] Maybe you spend an hour and a half in
[73:37] the car each day driving. Maybe you have
[73:39] a dog and you're walking the dog. Like
[73:40] all of those periods you could be using
[73:42] to consume knowledge. And that's where I
[73:44] found like over the years there's all of
[73:47] us have 3 to 5 hours in a day that we
[73:50] are doing something, but we're not
[73:52] cognitively demand we're not being like
[73:54] demanded cognitively that we could use
[73:57] to listen to something.
[73:59] I actually started planning walks now
[74:01] into because I had walks when when I
[74:04] lived at my parents house uh years ago
[74:06] because we also had a dog and and and I
[74:08] was forced to to walk the dog and then
[74:10] after a while I actually enjoyed it and
[74:12] now moving into the city I don't have
[74:14] that anymore but we have a really big
[74:16] palace and where is like a really huge
[74:19] uh forest around it. So I I usually go
[74:22] there and uh I force myself to walk
[74:25] around 10 kilometers which is uh six
[74:29] miles something like that uh per day in
[74:32] the morning. I I don't do it multiple
[74:34] times a day. It would be probably best
[74:35] like do in the morning and a little bit
[74:36] in the evening but I just want to get it
[74:38] out of the uh away in in the morning
[74:41] directly and it's such an amazing time.
[74:44] I listen to whatever I want to listen
[74:46] but mostly audio books like mostly audio
[74:48] books but I never take notes on that. I
[74:50] think you should start that. I think you
[74:52] you you changed the way I I listen to
[74:54] books I think. That's awesome. No well
[74:57] yeah I just really appreciate curious
[74:59] individuals that are interested about
[75:01] the world and so I appreciate you
[75:03] sharing that. H really cool. Um speaking
[75:06] on what we have learned and stuff like
[75:08] that it's really great. I I I have one
[75:11] question that I ask each and every one
[75:13] of my guests and for repeating guests I
[75:15] change it a little bit and the question
[75:18] is what have you learned since you have
[75:20] last been on on the podcast it's been
[75:23] around I think a year or something like
[75:24] that which isn't about Bitcoin. This is
[75:27] so good. Hm.
[75:30] Um the okay you know what the most
[75:34] recent rabbit hole that I have gone down
[75:37] deeply is how maybe this is a little
[75:40] personal but for the last like five six
[75:43] years I've had like eczema here
[75:45] underneath the eyes I've had this eczema
[75:47] flare up and I was like is this dietary
[75:50] related? And I'm eating freaking like
[75:52] grass-fed beef. I'm eating like organic
[75:55] vegetables of which vegetables I do eat.
[75:56] I don't eat a ton of them. I eat like
[75:59] raw milk that is like from a grass-fed
[76:01] farm. I'm just like, "What is going on?"
[76:04] Like, "What is flaring this?" So, I was
[76:05] like, "Well, maybe I've become allergic
[76:07] to freaking milk." So, I cut milk. And
[76:09] then I went and saw a naturopath and
[76:11] they're like, "Maybe you should cut eggs
[76:12] as well cuz eggs can be hard." I'm just
[76:13] like, "Okay." So, I cut eggs. I'm just
[76:15] like, "Cool. I'm eating freaking sweet
[76:16] potatoes and meat." I'm just like this.
[76:19] It I love it. It's a little bland. It's
[76:21] a little boring after a while. So, I
[76:23] noticed that sometimes it would flare up
[76:25] with things and other times it wouldn't.
[76:27] And I was just like, "This doesn't make
[76:28] any sense. This doesn't seem like an
[76:30] allergy. If we're allergic to something,
[76:32] it is consistent. If you have that
[76:34] allergen, it will trigger an immune
[76:36] response." So I was like, "This doesn't
[76:37] seem like an allergy. I don't know what
[76:39] it is." So then I went down and I've
[76:41] went down this rabbit hole years ago and
[76:43] I never really kind of followed through.
[76:45] I went down the parasite rabbit hole and
[76:48] it's a deep rabbit hole to go down
[76:50] because you realize that all of us have
[76:51] parasites. Every single one of us have
[76:53] parasites and some parasites are good.
[76:55] Some parasite, most parasites are bad.
[76:57] And those parasites are consuming a lot
[77:00] of our nutrients. They are emitting
[77:02] toxins which leads to a whole bunch of
[77:04] our health issues, neurological issues,
[77:06] allergies, you name it. Autoimmune
[77:08] issues. And there are studies coming out
[77:10] now that are profound. Like in 100% of
[77:14] multiple scerosis patients, they have
[77:17] parasites in their spinal fluid. In 100%
[77:20] of multiple cerosis patients. And
[77:22] there's a lot of cancer patients that
[77:24] they're now tying that they there's a
[77:27] lot of studies that are showing that
[77:28] cancer is a result of parasites. And
[77:31] it's profound when you go down this
[77:32] rabbit hole. And so I am been reading up
[77:36] for the last maybe like month and a
[77:38] half, two months on the most effective
[77:40] parasite cleanse. And uh one of my good
[77:43] friends ended up going and doing a
[77:45] parasite cleanse recently. And she was
[77:47] just like I didn't really expect much of
[77:48] it. She's like pretty healthy. She lives
[77:51] in the mountains, eats good quality
[77:52] food, very conscious of her health. She
[77:54] did a parasite cleanse, and what came
[77:56] out the other end, I'm not going to
[77:57] share, was just absolutely disgusting.
[78:00] Like absolutely disgusting. And so,
[78:02] right now, I'm just like, you know what?
[78:04] I want to get rid of whatever is inside
[78:06] of me. And so, I'm going down this
[78:07] rabbit hole of parasite cleans. And so,
[78:08] hopefully, maybe the next time we'll
[78:10] talk, I'm hopefully going to do a
[78:11] parasite cleanse over the next like two
[78:13] and a half months. and uh we'll see what
[78:15] the results are and see if that resolves
[78:17] some of these health issues that have
[78:19] been going on for years that I've not
[78:20] been able to figure out and they just
[78:22] seem like the health practitioners can't
[78:24] figure out. And a lot of health
[78:25] practitioners are also very they're just
[78:28] like ah parasites aren't an issue like
[78:31] parasite tests don't come up positive
[78:32] for parasites but then you actually do
[78:34] these parasite cleanses and everyone is
[78:35] parasites. So that is a bit of a random
[78:37] topic but that's what I'm going through
[78:39] right now. I never heard about that.
[78:41] Like literally never heard about that. I
[78:44] I have to check it out later uh to to
[78:46] see parasites. Um really cool. We have
[78:48] Andrew as you know from uh from the
[78:50] previous episode that we had where the
[78:52] previous guest is asking a question for
[78:54] the next guest without knowing who the
[78:55] next guest is and the previous guest
[78:57] asked you the question what is the
[78:59] biggest lie that you have been living
[79:01] that Bitcoin revealed to you? I think
[79:03] the biggest
[79:04] lie I think the biggest
[79:07] lie that Bitcoin is increasingly
[79:11] revealing to me is that I believe we are
[79:16] in a
[79:19] simulation and I had a really good
[79:22] conversation with um I had a really good
[79:24] conversation with uh Preston Pesh when
[79:27] we we were just recently at a conference
[79:29] together and we were talking and He
[79:32] shared the most profound explanation of
[79:36] and it's not I'm not saying this is his
[79:37] belief. He just shared this explanation
[79:39] of whether or not um we're in a
[79:41] simulation. And the explanation that he
[79:44] gave is let's just say we're in a
[79:48] society and we're in a very primitive
[79:50] society and we start to become more
[79:52] productive. And we start to become more
[79:54] efficient and we start to create tools
[79:56] and eventually those tools start to take
[79:59] our jobs and those tools start to impede
[80:03] our ability to show up and contribute to
[80:05] society and eventually we create AI and
[80:09] AI and robotics basically make humans
[80:11] redundant. Well, what would we do under
[80:13] that situation if we're getting rising
[80:15] rates of depression and anxiety and
[80:17] suicide and drug use because basically
[80:19] we've just got no hope. we don't have
[80:21] any ability to feel like we're
[80:22] contributing to society. What would we
[80:24] do? Well, we'd probably create a
[80:27] simulation and we'd step into that
[80:29] simulation back to a more p primitive
[80:31] time. So now we're in a simulation at a
[80:33] primitive time. And what do we do? We
[80:35] start to increase our productivity
[80:36] efficiency and we create tools and we
[80:38] create it again. And so one of the
[80:40] things he says is, I wonder if AI was
[80:43] created or if AI was discovered.
[80:46] Discovered as in we discovered it again.
[80:49] It's been created in the past and we're
[80:51] just rediscovering it as we're stepping
[80:53] into these simulations time and time and
[80:54] time and time again. And to me, as I go
[80:56] down these rabbit holes, there's a lot
[80:58] more to it than just that conversation.
[81:00] But there's a lot more that to me, I
[81:03] just feel like there's a big facade as
[81:05] to how we think the world works. And I
[81:07] think the world doesn't work in that
[81:08] way. I think that Bitcoin is kind of
[81:10] lifting the curtain and you're
[81:11] realizing, huh, the monetary system
[81:13] doesn't work in the way that I thought
[81:14] it works. The healthare system doesn't
[81:15] work in the way that I thought it works.
[81:17] education. Hm. I feel like we're being
[81:19] spun a lot of propaganda and a lot of
[81:20] lies. And so I think that to me, I'm
[81:23] starting to increasingly lean into this
[81:25] idea that I think we are in a simulation
[81:30] of sorts. And I find that a really
[81:32] interesting thing. I don't find it
[81:33] scary. I find it really interesting. But
[81:35] that's probably the biggest lie that
[81:36] I've come across so far. It's like It's
[81:39] like when Neo discovered that there are
[81:42] multiple version of the Matrix. What was
[81:45] it? first movie or the second of
[81:47] probably the I I don't know it it's been
[81:49] so long that I've watched the movies but
[81:51] where Neil uh stepped in and he
[81:54] discovered that this is not the first
[81:55] Matrix and he's not the first Neo
[81:57] basically in the system uh and it's like
[82:00] an an loop that that is going on. Um
[82:04] that is profound. I I I also love the
[82:08] the the thing that Elil Musk gave as an
[82:11] explanation of why we could be in a
[82:13] matrix or in a simulation. He said like
[82:16] the the the video games 20 years from
[82:19] from now or 10 years from now was so
[82:22] much more uh like obvious that it's a
[82:25] video game than it's now. If you now
[82:27] play let's take uh FIFA uh like the the
[82:30] football simulator. If you look from
[82:33] outside from the window of a bar into an
[82:38] TV, you have no way of knowing if it's a
[82:42] football simulator later or actually a
[82:45] television of showing an actual football
[82:48] game. Mhm. If you spend that further and
[82:51] further out and video games get much
[82:54] better and simulations of of sorts of
[82:57] sorts get much better, you have no way
[83:00] of knowing if things are actually real
[83:03] or if it's basically just like a
[83:06] simulation or a video game. So the
[83:08] likelihood that we are in a simulation
[83:10] is non zero. And this this thing of that
[83:15] it's non zero whatever the percentage
[83:17] likelihood of that is is uh really
[83:21] mindboggling for me like oh like maybe
[83:23] all those things are pre-programmed and
[83:25] and what how much can I actually decide
[83:30] for myself even in that simulation like
[83:33] maybe it was always meant to be that I I
[83:36] have to do the Bitcoin podcast like that
[83:38] maybe that was pre-programmed that I go
[83:41] there to to go through the steps. So
[83:44] yeah, that's that's a really deep rabbit
[83:48] hole. Well, and what I think is
[83:49] interesting is if we are indeed stepping
[83:53] into this simulation and then into the
[83:55] next simulation and into the next
[83:57] simulation, could Bitcoin be a way to
[84:00] break that chain in that at the moment,
[84:03] what is causing us to slowly
[84:06] increasingly find a lack of purpose in
[84:09] life and meaninglessness? And yes, we do
[84:11] have technology advancing and that's not
[84:13] going to stop. But I think the money
[84:15] plays a huge role in that and that
[84:17] people are struggling to survive. We're
[84:19] basically just existing. And so people
[84:21] are trying to escape life. And when it
[84:24] comes to Bitcoin, what if Bitcoin
[84:28] enabled people because of the increasing
[84:30] purchasing power, it enabled people more
[84:33] capacity to show up wholeheartedly in
[84:35] life, to contribute time to their
[84:37] communities, to contribute time to their
[84:39] families, and to find value in different
[84:41] more traditional ways. And so it maybe
[84:43] reverses this course of stepping into
[84:45] these simulations and stepping into
[84:46] these simulations. And that I think is
[84:48] profound. Seb, it has been one of my
[84:52] favorite conversations so far. It was
[84:54] really really cool to to to step into
[84:56] with you in so many different
[84:57] conversations. I I should share that
[85:00] once on my podcast. I usually have like
[85:02] there's like an feature on Riverside
[85:03] where you can take uh notes of where you
[85:07] find the conversation very interesting
[85:09] to put that into uh intro and clips and
[85:12] stuff like that. So you can already do
[85:14] it. And there are two types of
[85:16] conversations. one where there is like
[85:18] almost none there because there was not
[85:20] that much interesting things in there
[85:22] and then there are those conversations
[85:23] where there's so much in there there's
[85:24] like 10 20 markers in there that where
[85:27] it's almost too much and today I
[85:29] completely forgot about that I
[85:31] completely forgot it was so interesting
[85:33] and I completely forgot to even take
[85:35] those marks so we'll make the
[85:37] post-prouction harder for the editor so
[85:39] sorry Pablo uh but uh it it happened so
[85:43] thank you so much for for having that
[85:44] great conversation with with us today.
[85:46] Um, before I let you go, where can
[85:48] people find you, ask you questions, and
[85:50] and reach out to you? Oh, man. And
[85:52] Robin, I I really appreciate you having
[85:54] me on. Like, I think that as I mentioned
[85:55] at the start, you have such a way with
[85:57] words and you ask such phenomenal
[85:59] questions, and I really just appreciate
[86:00] the curiosity. And so, yeah, I really I
[86:03] really enjoy these conversations and I'm
[86:04] looking forward to the third one,
[86:05] whenever that is. Um, I'm curious to see
[86:08] what it is that has changed, what is the
[86:10] next biggest lie in our lives. But um
[86:13] yeah, people can find me at on Twitter
[86:15] just at said Bunny and Bunny is bun n
[86:18] ey. Um I do have a little blog. I don't
[86:20] post on it too often because I try to
[86:22] post when something inspires me as
[86:24] opposed to trying to be frequent and
[86:26] just posting for the sake of posting. Um
[86:28] and then on top of that, we discussed
[86:30] quite a bit of my book, The Hidden Cost
[86:32] of Money. Uh and so if people are
[86:34] curious about how money weaves its
[86:35] influence into the world around us, uh
[86:37] you can find the hidden cost of money on
[86:39] Amazon and a lot of other sites. Um, and
[86:41] then the final thing I'll say is like I
[86:43] never want education uh or price to be a
[86:46] barrier to education. And so if someone
[86:48] can't afford the book, feel free to just
[86:49] reach out on Twitter and I'm more than
[86:51] happy to give you the ebook for free. I
[86:52] just want to be able to make education
[86:54] available to everyone. And again, I
[86:56] really appreciate you having me on,
[86:57] Robin. Thank you so much. Appreciate it
[86:59] a lot. Um, yeah. Also, thank you so much
[87:01] for everyone that is watching and
[87:03] listening for joining us today. As
[87:04] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[87:06] another episode. Bye-bye.
