[00:00] keep the door to self custody open fully
[00:02] like there's a straight up door for you
[00:03] to grab your money and get the [ __ ] out
[00:05] and I think we still have that window I
[00:06] still we're still in the window where we
[00:08] can upgrade Bitcoin we might not have
[00:09] that in 5 years do it before you get
[00:11] extremely rich I'm concerned that
[00:13] there's a future where we can't scale
[00:15] self- custody we all in dep Banks and
[00:17] even in that world we still have better
[00:19] money the important part is that we have
[00:21] that indestructible base layer of
[00:24] Bitcoin what would you do if if Bitcoin
[00:27] wasn't there before Bitcoin I I I I
[00:30] wanted to be a talk therapist I wanted
[00:31] to be a psychologist
[00:33] um so I would have probably stayed on
[00:37] track to psychology I would have
[00:38] probably been a psychology guy um I
[00:43] always
[00:44] liked I I always had a think for finance
[00:46] like I always liked money and I liked
[00:49] money management and and and like
[00:51] Financial engineering of sorts like
[00:53] thinking about money I I always find the
[00:55] topic interesting but I think I would
[00:57] have probably gone down this C
[00:59] psychology Rabbit Hole I think that's
[01:01] sort of my uh my other love it's an
[01:05] interesting fall experiment because I
[01:07] think once you get Bitcoin you get that
[01:09] it's such an an amazing and uh elegent
[01:14] solution to to the problem or where do I
[01:18] put my financial energy and then also so
[01:21] many more uh problems like with
[01:24] censorship uh resistance money and stuff
[01:26] like that but even the simple problem
[01:28] like I work where where do I save that
[01:32] energy without being a financial
[01:34] operative financial planner and stuff
[01:37] like that on the side it's it's it's
[01:40] it's a it's a big problem and uh with
[01:43] Bitcoin there yeah with Bitcoin there
[01:45] are coming other problems up and I saw
[01:47] your PIN tweet and this is I think a
[01:49] topic that especially bitcoiners are uh
[01:52] really really um yeah curious and and
[01:55] and passionate about about self- custody
[01:58] because when you get Bitcoin you
[02:01] understand that s cusset is really
[02:02] really important and I saw your PIN
[02:04] tweet on on your profile and you you
[02:06] said like it's like a video of you
[02:08] explaining like the five uh mistakes
[02:11] that Bitcoin are making with self-
[02:13] custody and I think you are also like
[02:15] really longterm now in Bitcoin you're
[02:17] long-term hudler um what should what
[02:20] should people like know and and and uh
[02:24] when they go about self- custody like
[02:27] what's the the biggest hurdles they to
[02:30] go through Bes yeah I mean I think I
[02:32] think definitely go watch that speech
[02:33] even though my tweet um I I kind of had
[02:37] a a pretty good presentation where I
[02:39] went through you know five big mistakes
[02:42] I've seen people make um I would say the
[02:46] biggest mistake people actually make is
[02:50] they create a maze around their private
[02:52] keys that is so complex and paranoid
[02:55] that they themselves L lose access so
[02:58] that's like one
[03:00] one version of the worst mistakes if you
[03:03] if you're you know if you're inclined
[03:05] towards paranoia like many of us are
[03:07] right uh that's likely to be the thing
[03:10] you do right the other one is you do the
[03:13] lazy thing right the lazy thing is you
[03:15] take a screenshot of the 12 words on
[03:17] your phone and and upload it to your
[03:19] Google drive or iCloud that's the also
[03:21] the worst thing you can do like you
[03:23] can't be lazy and you can't be you know
[03:27] extremely paranoid right because both of
[03:30] them lead to you know higher risk of
[03:33] loss of funds you just gota like use the
[03:35] most well tested most Standard Process
[03:40] follow the the the the best practices
[03:44] which is basically don't take a picture
[03:46] of the 12 words right like whatever you
[03:48] do and never put it into like a keyboard
[03:51] never type it in if you if you lose your
[03:53] Hardware wallet right or your phone you
[03:57] type it into your phone okay you recover
[03:58] you move your money out Out start a
[04:00] fresh one start a fresh a fresh uh
[04:03] wallet I think that that's generally
[04:05] good advice
[04:08] um you know there's details right but
[04:11] like generally you just you know if if
[04:13] you if you if you have to recover a
[04:15] wallet move your money out get a start a
[04:17] fresh wallet yeah I mean I think that
[04:19] those are like the that's the easy
[04:21] answer right just don't make a copy
[04:22] don't don't make a digital copy of your
[04:25] of your tow don't take don't take a
[04:26] screenshot and uh get it to haror
[04:29] wallets I think I think if you're
[04:30] holding any significant amount of money
[04:32] in Bitcoin and crypto or whatever you're
[04:34] into you know a $60 60 Euro treasure t
[04:39] or it's not it's not going to you
[04:42] know it's going to be worth the risk
[04:44] right like this is the equivalent of
[04:46] insurance right like your bank's going
[04:48] to charge you more per year than that so
[04:50] just buy a hardware wallet buy a
[04:51] treasure don't buy a ledger Ledger sucks
[04:54] buy a treaser if you're more technical
[04:57] get a cold card but I would say like
[04:59] treasure is a really good starting point
[05:02] and uh and yeah just just read the
[05:04] manual you know I mean it's it's not
[05:06] going to take you days or anything you
[05:08] know within half an hour you'll be set
[05:10] up proper you know an hour at Best But
[05:13] like or at worst but like yeah that I
[05:15] just buy a hardware wallet it's not it's
[05:17] not that big a deal they're in the
[05:18] market um and they're great technology
[05:20] they're great software and like your
[05:22] computer is terrible your computer
[05:24] probably has malware on it your cell
[05:26] phone's a little bit better but you're
[05:29] like desktop computers and the laptops
[05:32] are really difficult to lock down like
[05:34] pretty much impossible to secure so uh
[05:36] cell phones that a little bit better but
[05:38] not perfect so like if you're if you're
[05:40] getting to a point where you have like
[05:41] tens of thousands of dollars even like I
[05:43] wouldn't put more than 10 grand on a
[05:45] cell phone right but like if you're
[05:46] putting like tens of thousands of
[05:48] dollars in your
[05:50] phone it's way time to get a harder
[05:52] wallet and the the last thing I'll say
[05:54] is like these markets are very volatile
[05:57] right one day you might think oh price
[05:59] went down 30% I guess it's not a big
[06:01] deal right like whatever I I'll do I'll
[06:03] upgrade my security later and then three
[06:05] months later you wake up and the price
[06:07] has done a 10x or 5x and you have 50
[06:11] Grand on your phone right or something
[06:12] like that way past time to do to upgrade
[06:16] your security so like you want to have
[06:18] security that can handle like a 5 to 10x
[06:21] moving price upwards right so uh yeah
[06:24] just just get a her wallet her wallet
[06:26] covers most use cases and then from
[06:28] there just more reading right I'm I'm
[06:30] I'm I'm working on a book hopefully by
[06:32] the end of the year I'll have this self
[06:33] cust book down but um yeah I mean I
[06:37] think it's just you know and if it's too
[06:39] much work and if you're too lazy and if
[06:41] you don't want self- custody if you
[06:43] don't care that's fine go use the best
[06:44] exchange in the game go get an ETF
[06:47] Bitcoin ETF or whatever if you're you
[06:49] know but like don't have ass it you have
[06:52] to like actually be like okay I want I
[06:54] want this to be off the hands of third
[06:56] parties I want this to be mine and that
[06:59] means you got you got to take some
[06:59] responsibility and do a little bit
[07:01] studying but again the haror worlds are
[07:02] so easy to use it's you almost have no
[07:04] excuse yeah I mean the those learning
[07:06] are really really good uh I mean the
[07:08] first one uh the last one you said with
[07:11] do it before you get extremely rich like
[07:14] we we uh a lot of people had Bitcoin
[07:18] back in the days then they forget about
[07:20] it they don't even know where they are
[07:23] uh or they lost it through some hack
[07:25] because they were not careful with them
[07:27] because they were like worth maybe like
[07:29] 100 euros back then or dollars and then
[07:32] all of the sudden they shoot up crazy
[07:35] and then it gets to point where
[07:38] attackers having an incentive to get
[07:40] them and then they got them and then
[07:42] they're like oh I lost it because I
[07:44] don't not take care of them like get
[07:46] your uh uh Bitcoin security right before
[07:49] the 5x 10x 20x and as you also said I
[07:52] think a lot of people actually do that
[07:55] um just like it's so usual like every
[07:58] time I get like an airplane ticket and
[08:00] there's like a number I just take a
[08:02] picture with my phone to like if if I
[08:04] don't get the email or something then I
[08:06] have the thing on my phone uh but don't
[08:10] do this with your Bitcoin private key
[08:13] with your recovery phrase it's it's so
[08:15] important uh to not store like you you
[08:18] you get a hardware wallet you you get
[08:20] your uh yeah plate you somewhere where
[08:24] you like actually save your recovery
[08:27] phrase and then you go ahead and save it
[08:30] online or it does not make sense like if
[08:33] if you save it online somewhere you can
[08:35] leave it on Exchange
[08:38] also yeah it's yeah and especially with
[08:43] AI coming like if someone gets access to
[08:46] your pictures somehow they just run like
[08:49] an AI picture like even if you can hide
[08:52] it your words somehow in the picture and
[08:53] you remember oh I have it on this
[08:55] picture and I know that because in the
[08:57] beginning when I had no clue I did that
[09:01] and I was like I will hide my seed
[09:03] phrase in the picture so you cannot see
[09:05] it nicely only if you zoom it like that
[09:08] those AI programs will zoom in and they
[09:10] will scan those pictures and they will
[09:12] find your keys I think they will I think
[09:14] they will it's just a terrible idea just
[09:16] don't take a picture of your tough words
[09:18] it's never for no reason there's no good
[09:20] reason to do that do you see a a future
[09:22] where everybody is key like I always do
[09:25] it like uh like when if you zoom out
[09:27] like 20 30 years in the um in the past
[09:32] nobody knew how to send an email or
[09:33] stuff like that and now everybody knows
[09:36] how to send an email set up Google
[09:38] accounts set up all the basic things
[09:40] we're doing right now will it be the
[09:41] same for there are still people that
[09:43] can't send
[09:45] email there's like probably like I would
[09:48] say 30 40% of the world still probably
[09:51] can't send an email I would imagine 20
[09:54] 30% yeah yeah they just don't have like
[09:56] they just haven't been exposed to it
[09:58] they're just getting exposed to to it
[09:59] now or they're really old and they're
[10:01] just like not interested or just they
[10:03] they never care because they had
[10:04] somebody they could call to deal with
[10:05] that stuff um Google Cloud all this
[10:08] stuff like even that like to us it's a
[10:11] generational shift
[10:13] eventually a lot of people will be like
[10:15] comfortable maybe with a Bitcoin wallet
[10:18] but the thing is self- custody is is
[10:20] changing right so in 50
[10:24] years onchain Bitcoin is probably going
[10:28] going to be
[10:29] you know if we're in a hyper Bitcoin
[10:31] World uncha Bitcoin is going to be
[10:33] something that only really institutions
[10:36] use big exchanges big liquidity
[10:39] providers it's going to be a a
[10:41] settlement layer and self- costed is
[10:43] going to have to Bubble upwards and
[10:45] self- custody is going to be somewhat
[10:47] different we're trying to keep it tied
[10:50] to the 12w system because it's it's
[10:52] already like we've already trained the
[10:53] generation into the 12 wordss the 12
[10:56] wordss work they are the easiest thing
[10:58] we have to self- custody so maybe that
[11:02] that that'll continue but but self-
[11:04] custody is going to change a little bit
[11:06] it's I think with lighting we're seeing
[11:08] that there's sort of there's uh there's
[11:11] differences in like if you want very
[11:14] cost effective self- sovereignty like
[11:17] like you don't how you want you don't
[11:19] want to be paying $3 or minimum to move
[11:21] a Bitcoin or move move Bitcoins on chain
[11:25] um if you want it cheaper than that then
[11:27] um then there's some trade-offs involved
[11:30] even if it's attached to the 12 words so
[11:32] I mean I don't know where self custody
[11:33] is going to be in 30 40 years I hope
[11:35] that we still have self custody I think
[11:37] I think it's it's very important for us
[11:40] to defend it I think at the very least
[11:41] we'll have much better money and much
[11:44] better Banks potentially but um but I
[11:47] think I I could see a world
[11:50] where you know there's one technology
[11:52] that's really cool it's like it's it's
[11:55] very early stages for it but it's like
[11:57] basically this little devices that are
[11:59] they are like Hardware wallets and they
[12:01] have like an input to your phone and
[12:03] then they have like an output to your
[12:04] phone and then like an input in the back
[12:06] and then you can get three of them and
[12:08] then like you just sort of sign with one
[12:10] sign with the other one sign with the
[12:12] other one and chain them together plug
[12:13] them to your phone it's just like it's
[12:16] going to be something like that they're
[12:17] going to make everything physical it has
[12:18] to be I think like a magical stone that
[12:21] you have that you bang against another
[12:23] magical stone and your money moves right
[12:25] or it's going to be you know if you have
[12:27] a chip in your head it's going to be
[12:28] part of your multi it's going to be like
[12:30] a key here and a key here and just click
[12:32] you know and your money moves right I
[12:34] don't know how that's going to work but
[12:37] I think the future of self custody is
[12:40] some sort of version of multi- signature
[12:42] or multi key setup it's going to be
[12:45] something you I mean security digital
[12:47] Security today is like that it's
[12:48] something you have something you own and
[12:50] something you know so something you know
[12:53] no something you have something you are
[12:55] and something you know so a password
[13:01] um you know the the big corpse want you
[13:03] to do biometric I don't like
[13:06] biometric uh I don't recommend biometric
[13:08] but that's one of the ways to do it and
[13:10] then something you have so Hardware
[13:12] wallet password and then like maybe a
[13:16] chip or maybe a [ __ ] your thumb or
[13:19] like you know red no scan or you know
[13:23] whatever right um I think I think you're
[13:26] fine with like password and Hardware I
[13:27] don't think you need I don't think you
[13:29] need really need a third but
[13:32] um yeah I think that that's the big
[13:34] that's the big promise right like I
[13:35] think we need to we need to sort of
[13:38] think a lot about self- custody in the
[13:40] future I think that's a big problem
[13:42] that's one of the reasons I'm I'm a big
[13:43] fan of covenants right now there's like
[13:45] a softw workk conversation inside of
[13:47] Bitcoin about like creating covenants
[13:49] which is a new technology that lets us
[13:51] scale self custody better so I mean if
[13:53] you're if you're bitcoiner like a hard
[13:55] bitcoiner and you're and you're looking
[13:56] to if you're curious about that look it
[13:59] up look up Covenant on bitcoin but um
[14:03] yeah I mean I think that's that that's
[14:04] the way that it's going to work if if we
[14:06] can figure it out how to scale self
[14:08] custody to you know billions of people
[14:10] it's going to be it's going to be a
[14:12] couple of things you're going to have a
[14:13] rock and a phone and just going to bang
[14:15] them together and move your money right
[14:17] uh and it's probably going to have
[14:18] spending limits and stuff I mean this is
[14:21] all software we can program we could
[14:23] program in anything that people really
[14:26] need uh if there's demand for I think
[14:29] you know at the end of the
[14:32] day it's interesting to think about the
[14:35] future and you also said like the the
[14:37] layer one will be only the settlement
[14:39] layer because fees will shoot up uh um
[14:43] even more as as I also think so and it's
[14:45] it's also necessary to keep Bitcoin
[14:47] secure someone has to to pay for the
[14:50] whole security of it and if you have a
[14:53] really important um transaction I don't
[14:56] know like the transaction from uh father
[14:59] to to son to like give some some of the
[15:02] whole netw Worth to him or something
[15:04] like that I mean would be easy to just
[15:06] exchange keys but something like that
[15:09] then it makes sense to do it on chain
[15:11] but then it moves up how do you see like
[15:14] the the the layers on I mean it's really
[15:16] hard to foresee the whole future on
[15:19] layers and how we we scale Bitcoin when
[15:22] like everybody has it long on a Bitcoin
[15:24] standard but how do you see uh us buying
[15:28] a car coffee at a at a at a coffee place
[15:31] in like 20 30 50 years on bitcoin do you
[15:35] see like only one two layers uh some
[15:38] people are like oh there will be like 10
[15:40] layers on top of
[15:42] Bitcoin um I heard so many crazy fears
[15:44] about scaling Bitcoin uh that uh it's
[15:48] it's it's interesting where where we are
[15:50] going how do you see yeah I think I so
[15:53] so the way that I see it right now is
[15:55] you know it's not that different than
[15:57] normal money right if you're like a
[15:59] multi-millionaire right you don't you
[16:01] don't carry your money in your phone
[16:04] that's ridiculous you also also don't
[16:06] have it at home right um not necessarily
[16:10] like you might have a certain portion of
[16:12] your wealth like in your like as the
[16:15] value of your home like your home is
[16:17] part of your money your your home is
[16:19] part of your wealth anyway right but you
[16:23] don't have all your money in your home
[16:24] you might have a vault with some money
[16:27] right like a partial maybe a chunk of
[16:29] your money but not all of it right um I
[16:32] think you know your your your wallet is
[16:36] a relatively low security thing right
[16:39] like you can be walking down the street
[16:40] in the wrong place and somebody will mug
[16:42] you what are you going to do just
[16:43] [ __ ] take the money right you would
[16:45] have carry all your money in your phone
[16:47] all your money in your pocket right so I
[16:49] think I think people will
[16:51] naturally Bridge those frames of
[16:55] security into Bitcoin and say well okay
[16:58] there's there's like some there's
[17:00] there's spending wallets for Bitcoin
[17:04] like today we are used to the lighting
[17:06] Network the lighning network is a way to
[17:08] use move money very fast I think the
[17:10] lightning Network seems to be moving
[17:11] towards infrastructure as well so it'll
[17:13] probably become like backend payment
[17:16] sort of network
[17:18] between big institutions in Bitcoin or
[17:21] big wallets or big
[17:23] exchanges even small wallets it doesn't
[17:25] have to be that big but it'll become
[17:27] like a professional thing because it's
[17:28] really hard to like run a lightning note
[17:31] right and so more most likely the
[17:34] wallets that we'll be using as far as I
[17:36] as the technology that I'm aware of
[17:37] today it'll be ecash tokens with mints
[17:41] behind them so like it'll be like ecash
[17:43] Bitcoin Banks and the Bitcoin banks are
[17:46] going to be right now one of the keyword
[17:48] is there's a fety Min and a fety Min is
[17:51] like this Federation it's a mint it's a
[17:54] federation that mints an e-cash token
[17:57] this ecash tokens are like
[18:00] digital certificates they're like
[18:03] digital cash certificates they're
[18:05] digital papers right and they are
[18:08] denominated like let's say you know one
[18:10] sat 10 SATs a thousand SATs a million
[18:13] SATs 100 million SATs right they're
[18:15] denominated like cash and then you can
[18:17] pass them around
[18:19] digitally and they work like cash in the
[18:22] sense and they and they don't have
[18:24] blockchain so they don't have scaling
[18:27] problems and they don't a blockchain so
[18:29] they don't have privacy problems so
[18:31] they're very private very scalable but
[18:34] they have one big trade-off and is that
[18:36] somebody has to Mint them so they have a
[18:38] self they have a third party custody
[18:40] risk so there's a counterparty that's
[18:43] collateralizing those M those ecash
[18:46] tokens with real Bitcoin and so I think
[18:49] I think I hope that we can find ways to
[18:51] use bitcoin's Smart Contracting
[18:54] languages and its scripts to like
[18:56] restrict these Banks from rugging people
[18:59] right so like make rug pool resistant
[19:01] Banks potentially
[19:03] right but I think that's likely what's
[19:06] going to happen there's going to be
[19:07] banks that are going to serve offer like
[19:09] Bitcoin banks that are going to offer
[19:10] e-cash wallets that you're going to be
[19:11] able to send more money freely there's
[19:13] already these wallets already exist like
[19:15] this is already here it's just not in
[19:17] use yet because it's still kind of early
[19:18] stages but it's here there's wallets you
[19:20] can look up ecash Bitcoin and like
[19:22] there's 10 wallets you can download and
[19:24] play with right so and they work and the
[19:27] money moves and it's free or basically
[19:30] free and it's fast and you just sort of
[19:33] you can you can get to you can make a
[19:35] work with uh NFC and like just tap
[19:38] potentially tap a payment sort of
[19:42] machine from a retail store and just
[19:44] have it process the payment like that's
[19:45] in theory as easy as it could get um so
[19:50] I think that's the future of spending
[19:52] for coffee now you're going to have
[19:55] maybe like ah harder wallet in your
[19:59] computer or something like that like
[20:00] maybe maybe you're you have like a
[20:01] lightning node you know relationship
[20:05] with with with a lighting note provider
[20:07] like Phoenix Right Phoenix is really
[20:08] interesting because they have they give
[20:09] you 12 words if Phoenix the company goes
[20:12] down you can grab those 12 words put
[20:14] them on electrum recover your
[20:17] money but they manage the liquidity side
[20:19] of lighting they they deal with the
[20:21] complicated stuff but you can send
[20:23] through them right so like that's like a
[20:25] sort of Bitcoin Bank relationship where
[20:28] they don't really have custody they have
[20:30] like custody for like a couple of
[20:32] seconds and then they fill up your
[20:34] account you know like it's like Risk
[20:37] minim it's it's trust minimized risk
[20:39] minimized relationship right that's
[20:42] likely going to be like you know the
[20:43] medium siiz payments right and then the
[20:46] and then the big size payments are is
[20:48] going to be Bitcoin onchain and maybe
[20:50] there's going to be like covenants
[20:51] around Bitcoin chain a covenant is like
[20:54] we basically come together with a bunch
[20:56] of people and pull our money into a
[20:59] little smart contract and then that
[21:03] that's like that that smart contract you
[21:06] know settles balances with other
[21:08] entities and stuff it's a little
[21:09] complicated to explain but like we'll
[21:11] probably like be sharing utxos with
[21:13] other people through a covenant it's
[21:15] like virtual utxos so I mean I think
[21:17] that there there's a lot of innovation
[21:19] happening on that front um assuming that
[21:21] we can sort of maybe uh do some updates
[21:24] to bitcoin that are that I think are
[21:26] necessary and they're getting consensus
[21:28] we're sort of in the process that but
[21:29] worst case scenario is just going to be
[21:30] onchain stuff and multi6 right
[21:34] so yeah I mean that's kind of how I see
[21:36] it right now I think I think we're in a
[21:38] transition period you know and a lot of
[21:40] people are just going to have it on ETFs
[21:41] right like it's just going to be ETFs
[21:44] and it's going to be Bitcoin exchanges
[21:45] or big big big centralized straightup
[21:48] custodians hopefully we can we can
[21:50] transition the market out of some of
[21:52] that but a lot of people are just going
[21:54] to not care to have self- custody or
[21:57] it's not not going to fit their thread
[21:59] model maybe they're too famous maybe
[22:00] they're too known maybe they're too rich
[22:03] and they trust the state their local
[22:05] jurisdiction and their local
[22:06] jurisdiction maybe is not that bad right
[22:08] and so
[22:11] um I think we're going to have a full
[22:13] range of options you know but
[22:16] um but yeah as far as self- custody
[22:19] that's the those are the three main
[22:20] technology branches that I see that I
[22:22] see
[22:24] developing yeah I also I also think um
[22:28] and I'm always like I'm really always
[22:31] really really really really bullish on
[22:33] the main layer and I always try to get
[22:36] that point across that the main layer is
[22:39] just so
[22:41] great uh and you can always like there's
[22:44] like Bitcoin ETFs there's lightning
[22:46] there's so much stuff going on the fedin
[22:48] what you're talking about uh and there
[22:51] will be probably hundreds of new
[22:54] technologies on top of Bitcoin there
[22:56] will be Technologies that won't succeed
[22:59] there will be technology that will
[23:00] succeed but the important part is that
[23:03] we have that uh undis un indestructible
[23:07] base layer of
[23:09] Bitcoin uh where everybody agrees on
[23:12] that one and then on top of that
[23:14] everybody can compete uh technology wise
[23:17] application wise clientwise what is the
[23:20] best spending wallet what is the best
[23:23] setup for individuals and there will
[23:26] obviously as you said people that we
[23:28] have oh I have my ETF and I have maybe
[23:30] my local currency uh as if if they um go
[23:35] on for for that long of a time if local
[23:39] currenc is existing then uhit some
[23:42] people only see Bitcoin as an store of
[23:44] value but then it moves to the medium
[23:46] exchange phase and then people also view
[23:49] it differently like there's a lot of
[23:51] things uh happening but but uh I always
[23:55] um want to make the point that the main
[23:58] layer is so important and then we can
[24:02] have things on top of
[24:04] that um what's your thoughts actually on
[24:07] uh the fear survival can how long can it
[24:11] survive and uh and there was one
[24:14] interesting question coming up uh
[24:16] yesterday on my feed um will Bitcoin
[24:19] extend or shorten uh the life of Fiat or
[24:23] does it even matter to the life of Fiat
[24:25] because it's destructing itself I think
[24:29] um I see the United States as sort of
[24:33] drunk on debt and I don't think they're
[24:37] stopping I don't think they're
[24:38] interested in triaa or double A you know
[24:41] Al callic
[24:42] synonymous
[24:44] um I think that I don't know that they
[24:48] that their their society is healthy
[24:51] enough
[24:52] to to reform itself before they collapse
[24:56] the dollar but they're going to
[24:59] try um and the collapse of the dollar
[25:02] would be a pretty uh cataclysmic
[25:06] event I think it's going to
[25:09] be a huge sort of reshuffle of wealth
[25:14] and it's it'll probably lead to a return
[25:16] to hard money because nobody trusts
[25:18] anybody else you know so like it'll
[25:22] probably r you know be the the rise of
[25:25] gold it'll probably be the rise of
[25:26] Bitcoin now now there's a catch which is
[25:30] the crypto dollar right the crypto
[25:32] dollar is tether it's
[25:35] usdc and then there's like this whole
[25:37] branch of cbdcs I think the cbdcs will
[25:39] fail because they're too ridiculous
[25:41] right like they're they're they're
[25:43] like they're like the worst money you
[25:46] could imagine right like just the the
[25:48] shittiest money like spending limits you
[25:51] know you it it has negative interest
[25:54] rates expiration dates on your money
[25:57] they track you everywhere charge you
[25:59] carbon credits like it's going to be
[26:00] just suck right like everybody's going
[26:02] to want to dump that as fast as they
[26:05] can you know anybody that has any
[26:07] significant money certainly is not going
[26:08] to be in a cbdc right and so I think
[26:12] cbdcs will fail but stable coins people
[26:15] like stable coins because they kind of
[26:18] feel like cash but they're digital and
[26:21] they're
[26:23] International and I think stable coins
[26:26] are
[26:28] a significant player in the in the
[26:30] market and I mean it's obvious right
[26:33] like the numbers say it you know
[26:36] and and the question is does a crypto
[26:40] dollar extend the lifespan of the dollar
[26:42] because it lets it
[26:44] get into the furthest reaches of the
[26:48] Globes
[26:50] markets where normal banking system
[26:52] Can't Get Right like like how many how
[26:55] much tether is being used in Brazil
[26:59] Argentina and Venezuela and how much
[27:02] impact does that have on the US economy
[27:05] you know tether who issues the most
[27:07] popular stable coin is a bigger
[27:10] purchaser of us bonds than
[27:13] Mexico they own more us bonds than
[27:17] Mexico so like tther is a big player now
[27:20] they're installed they they are they are
[27:24] they've made a deal with the devil so to
[27:26] speak which is the dollar right
[27:28] and and they're in cahoots and like
[27:30] they're married now and and if and if
[27:32] the federal government goes and like
[27:34] swats tether their bonds are going to
[27:36] crash and that's going to hurt and
[27:38] that's going to destabilize the economy
[27:40] like those two are already B bonded you
[27:43] know there there's already bond between
[27:44] them so I think the likely
[27:47] scenario is that the crypto dollar
[27:50] continues and becomes normal and beats
[27:55] out the the cbdcs and it becomes like a
[27:57] surveillance dollar that they can like
[28:00] digital dollar that they can they can
[28:03] like shut down your account if they
[28:04] decide that you're you know but they
[28:06] might not be able to do
[28:08] like all the other stuff they want like
[28:10] negative interest rates exper expiration
[28:12] dates they probably won't be able to do
[28:13] that if they do that to tether tether is
[28:15] goingon to die because it's just just
[28:17] they're just terrible ideas like there
[28:19] just terrible ideas around and so so in
[28:21] that case I think the dollar could
[28:23] extend a little bit could live a little
[28:25] bit further but at the end of the day
[28:26] it's about the interest rate
[28:28] like the the US the interest on the debt
[28:31] is already like over 50% of their tax
[28:33] income of the United States if they
[28:36] don't if they don't slow that down and
[28:38] reverse it hard like now if they don't
[28:40] do like a 180 right now that's going to
[28:43] go parabolic and the us is going to end
[28:46] up defaulting on their debt eventually
[28:48] right and they're going to have to go
[28:50] into austerity and it's going to shrink
[28:51] the US economy is just going to spiral
[28:53] down right so even with with tether I
[28:56] don't know that I don't know that the
[28:57] the dollar can survive but it could last
[29:00] another 20 years it could last another
[29:03] 30 years we don't know right like the
[29:06] pound has lasted like 300 years even
[29:08] though the average lifespan of Fiat is
[29:10] like 40 40 years the pound has lasted
[29:12] 300 right I'm super excited to announce
[29:16] that this podcast got the first ever
[29:19] sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[29:23] day one and they teach and preach self-
[29:26] custody this is my goto exchange when
[29:29] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[29:32] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[29:34] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[29:37] fees Plus at the same time support this
[29:40] podcast use code Robin and click the
[29:42] link in the description there's an
[29:44] interesting um calculation you can make
[29:47] uh I just made it from my Twitter
[29:50] account I never saw it before but may
[29:52] probably people made something similar
[29:54] before um I wanted to see how long it
[29:58] takes if you if you make a100 million a
[30:03] day uh and pay back the US dep uh to pay
[30:09] back 10% of that Dept and you need to uh
[30:13] earn or save or spend the the the depth
[30:17] back for 100 years every day spending
[30:21] hundred million doar and then you pay
[30:24] 10% of it
[30:26] back uh and this is like an interesting
[30:31] thought experiment like 100 years is
[30:32] like more than our life expectancies
[30:36] then 100 million a day is just in crazy
[30:39] amount most people don't even get to a
[30:41] million net worth over their um time
[30:46] over the whole year over the whole uh
[30:48] time lifespan uh and this is just 10%
[30:52] and this problem gets worse every day I
[30:55] was posting a meme with the 33 trillion
[30:58] dollar of depth and someone was posting
[31:01] behind oh that's already old it's like
[31:03] 34 now and soon it will be like a 35 and
[31:07] stuff like that and it's it's it's
[31:09] shocking and it's like how long can this
[31:11] go
[31:14] onest last crazy I think it's it's it's
[31:19] it's going parabolic and it and it's uh
[31:22] it's a compounded interest rate problem
[31:24] and uh as far as I understand and
[31:27] and Einstein said you know like compound
[31:29] interest is one of the wonders of the
[31:31] world if you're a benefactor of compound
[31:33] interest you're probably going to be
[31:36] rich if you're paying compound interest
[31:39] you're probably going to be poor
[31:41] because you know it's very sneaky and
[31:45] and then when it go goes parabolic It
[31:46] goes parabolic and so I don't see how
[31:48] they're going to turn it around man like
[31:51] the United States is so dysfunctional
[31:52] maybe the next election will bring like
[31:54] maybe Trump will figure something out
[31:56] but I don't know right like maybe he
[31:58] won't right
[32:01] so yeah it's it's pretty sus what do you
[32:04] see as the most profound change that
[32:07] will happen on a Bitcoin standard if you
[32:10] like zoom out and we are assuming the
[32:13] field standard actually dies off and we
[32:15] in this is Bitcoin kind of world in like
[32:19] let's say 50 years 100 years uh what's
[32:22] the most profound uh change for Society
[32:25] for business for or day-to-day life I
[32:29] heard someone saying yesterday
[32:33] on reply on me like we're going closer
[32:36] to type two civilization where enery is
[32:39] so abundant that it's just free for
[32:41] everybody because prices are falling so
[32:44] rapidly uh so like there's so many
[32:47] interesting experiments in that in
[32:49] deflationary system what's your father
[32:51] yeah there's a lot of really profound
[32:53] things that could happen under uh under
[32:57] better monetary system or under a sound
[32:58] monetary system but I think the one that
[33:01] that is let's say closest to my
[33:03] attention and the one that I or closest
[33:05] to my heart you know is it's basically
[33:08] the the demonetization of corruption I
[33:11] heard somebody say it like that so
[33:13] basically FIA currency was invented
[33:15] something like the
[33:16] 1400s
[33:18] um I think by by the medich or or by
[33:21] like the you know maybe not the Ben
[33:23] medich I think I think it was the
[33:25] Italians that invented it anyway I don't
[33:27] know but it was invented like the
[33:29] 1400s
[33:31] and and then the bank of England took it
[33:34] to to the next level and then like
[33:37] nationalized Fiat money
[33:39] right and that was I think to finance
[33:41] the first world war or something like
[33:43] that
[33:45] and the result is we ended up in these
[33:48] Democratic
[33:50] systems which have like the octopus of
[33:52] federal banks in the in the middle of
[33:55] them and what ends up happening is
[33:59] politicians get the country into debt in
[34:02] other words get the tax Bas into debt in
[34:05] order to pay off people that support
[34:07] their particular brand of politics or
[34:10] their particular career and so they're
[34:12] stealing from the public to subsidize
[34:14] their own
[34:16] careers and like creating a dependent
[34:18] class and that's that's a really
[34:21] profound corruption um that ends under
[34:26] mon standard like under a sound money
[34:29] standard because that money can't hold
[34:32] value it can't hold purchasing power and
[34:34] so it it it inflates very fast and
[34:38] people dump it and people don't accept
[34:40] it and people have to buy stuff with it
[34:43] and it
[34:45] dies a relatively fast death and so
[34:49] country like countries and and and and
[34:51] and you know political systems have to
[34:53] become fiscally
[34:55] responsible otherwise people are just
[34:57] going to go buy whatever the [ __ ] else
[34:59] they can especially if there's like a
[35:01] money a sound money that they can move
[35:03] around and hide well enough and protect
[35:06] themselves with and like flee to another
[35:08] country with right like Bitcoin
[35:12] accelerates the collapse and the end of
[35:14] the Fiat monetary standard and that is
[35:17] about as profound As It Gets In terms of
[35:18] money and and it means that political
[35:21] systems have to be fiscally responsible
[35:23] which means they have to be sane they
[35:25] have to be they have to consider time
[35:28] and they have to be consider the
[35:30] consequences of their actions their
[35:32] their their the behavior of politicians
[35:34] can no longer be detached from reality
[35:37] it has to be attached to reality because
[35:40] otherwise the consequences become
[35:42] visible fast enough presumably right and
[35:45] people's memories will be fresh with the
[35:48] failures of politicians that screwed
[35:50] them and the value their money and
[35:51] that's already happening all over L
[35:53] America and it's going to happen in the
[35:54] United States just a matter of time
[35:56] until it happens in in the United States
[35:57] in fact it's happened over the past two
[35:59] years you know 5 6% official inflation
[36:01] is pretty significant for them so um I
[36:06] think that's the trend and I think
[36:07] that's the that's the that's the deepest
[36:09] that's the deepest
[36:11] change that has other consequences right
[36:14] because if a if if a society is fiscally
[36:17] sane you know then they start investing
[36:19] in energy you know and and they start
[36:22] lowering the cost of energy not
[36:24] increasing it right like like American
[36:26] americ infrastru energy infrastructure
[36:28] for civilians is generally pretty bad
[36:30] like the grid sucks it's very expensive
[36:33] you know but there's other countries
[36:35] where they just like like I think
[36:36] Uruguay I think I'm not sure if it's
[36:38] Uruguay or Paraguay one of these
[36:39] countries in Latin America that doesn't
[36:41] have an ocean but they have like a like
[36:43] I think they have a huge River so they
[36:44] just build the most ridiculous Dam and
[36:46] they have so much energy they have to
[36:48] export it because they can't consume it
[36:50] and so there some of the biggest Bitcoin
[36:51] mines are there but um yeah they export
[36:55] energy to Brazil and like like two
[36:56] neighboring countries so um that's what
[36:59] happens when you think forward what's
[37:01] what happens when you have a same
[37:03] civilization a same Society right you
[37:05] make long-term Investments to lower your
[37:06] energy costs right like that's the first
[37:09] thing you should be doing so uh so I
[37:11] think the energy is like a side effect
[37:13] of that you know but but returning
[37:15] sanity to societies uh that are
[37:17] basically drunk in Fiat money I think
[37:20] that's that's the biggest that's the
[37:22] most profound change I can see I think
[37:24] that's also beautiful picture to see
[37:27] that currently we are on like a drunken
[37:31] mod where we just spending money and it
[37:33] feels like unreal and then there's
[37:36] inflation coming there's war coming
[37:37] there's so many consequences of that uh
[37:41] unresponsible irresponsible uh fiscal
[37:44] policy that triggers and triggers down
[37:47] in all the live areas basically and um
[37:52] maybe uh for like the average uh Bitcoin
[37:57] out there that actually understood
[37:59] Bitcoin they are like buying Bitcoin
[38:02] every month they're converting their
[38:04] feat constantly in Bitcoin they're
[38:05] running a note they're orange spilling
[38:07] friends and family they are obviously
[38:09] doing a lot already to um accelerate
[38:14] that uh trend for me it's like
[38:16] innevitable it's like Bitcoin will come
[38:18] and some money will uh be the standard
[38:22] but we can influence maybe how fast goes
[38:27] like maybe we can accelerate the whole
[38:29] thing um for that Bitcoin are watching
[38:32] do you see or do you have anything that
[38:35] you're like what else can we do what
[38:39] what can bitcoiners do to accelerate
[38:41] this uh Bitcoin adoption maybe faster
[38:45] maybe better make the transition to a
[38:47] new system
[38:49] smoother uh and yeah do we have
[38:51] something there like what what no I
[38:53] think I think people need to need to
[38:55] look into Covance um so let me let me
[38:57] give you a specific example of why I
[38:59] think covenants are important and what
[39:01] it what it what is required to get them
[39:04] right
[39:05] so um a a Bitcoin Covenant is a a new a
[39:11] a a a
[39:13] Bitcoin contract let's say Bitcoin that
[39:17] says
[39:18] that any money that you put into that
[39:21] contract let's say your own Bitcoin
[39:22] wallet can only be can only move 10% a
[39:26] month out
[39:28] right and it also has another spending
[39:31] condition which is that if this
[39:34] particular key which is maybe like deep
[39:36] in Cold Storage like buried in a hole in
[39:38] your house right like you know or or a
[39:42] multi that's like in three countries if
[39:44] those keys sign they can move all the
[39:47] money out but other than otherwise the
[39:50] normal key the one that maybe it's in
[39:51] your computer can only move 10% a month
[39:53] out right so it's it's putting spending
[39:57] restrictions on your onchain layer one
[40:00] Bitcoin wallet why is that important
[40:03] anytime you make an onchain Bitcoin
[40:05] transaction even if you're just trying
[40:07] to move 1% of that wealth you actually
[40:09] have to move 100% of the wealth when you
[40:12] spend an unspent transaction output when
[40:15] you when you move Bitcoin from address a
[40:18] like if you move like 1% of your Bitcoin
[40:21] from one address a to address B you move
[40:23] 1% to this address and then the other9
[40:26] 99% moves to another address of yours
[40:28] that's under your wallet but that means
[40:30] you're moving all of it you're just
[40:32] reshuffling it and 99% comes back to you
[40:35] that means you're risking a 100% of your
[40:37] Bitcoin every time you make a
[40:38] transaction that's actually ridiculous
[40:41] from a security perspective there's no
[40:43] Financial system that we can remember
[40:47] that works like that if you move more
[40:49] than like you know 10 grand in any US
[40:52] Bank they're going to start calling you
[40:53] be like bro are you okay did you get
[40:55] kidnapped right if if if somebody Taps
[40:59] if if somebody moves more than a 100
[41:00] bucks from your from your chip when you
[41:02] tap purchase something it's probably not
[41:05] going through unless you call them and
[41:06] tell them so spending conditions are a
[41:09] very very good way of securing and
[41:11] protecting Bitcoin Bitcoin can't do that
[41:13] today on chain like Bitcoin consensus
[41:15] rules don't allow that to happen today
[41:18] Satoshi originally had
[41:21] upcat in Bitcoin which let us do that
[41:24] but then he had like a p
[41:27] because he realized that there was like
[41:29] extra complexity or he thought there was
[41:30] extra complexity with other upcodes not
[41:32] just upcat and he just like bulk closed
[41:36] like a bunch of up up codes or things
[41:38] that gave more power to bitcoin
[41:40] contracts right it's been 15 years we
[41:44] have studied Covenant enough CTV has
[41:46] pretty good review opcat is very well
[41:48] reviewed there's a lot of developer
[41:50] consensus around opcat for example and
[41:53] we can turn them back on the problem is
[41:55] they require software a softwork just
[41:57] means that
[42:00] you if if if there's enough demand in
[42:02] the market we can activate it and it
[42:04] doesn't change it's not it's doesn't
[42:07] break compatibility with people that
[42:09] don't want to activate it but you you
[42:11] you need to we we're going to need to
[42:13] softwork them
[42:14] in it's it's a lot less code than segwit
[42:18] and Tapo Tapo and seg were very complex
[42:21] software packages actually like very
[42:22] profound changes to bitcoin CTV very
[42:26] simple very very simple like 10 lines of
[42:29] code uh the best package right now is L
[42:31] enhance L enhance is CTV and two other
[42:35] uh small upgrades that fix a lot of
[42:38] problems with lighting it make makes
[42:40] lighting symmetric so you don't have
[42:43] some of these inbound liquidity issues
[42:44] in the same way they solve a lot they
[42:46] make lighting programming a lot easier
[42:49] and they scale they basically let us do
[42:51] the sort of sharing of utxo so it it
[42:55] makes some like some of the estimates
[42:57] I've heard is like it makes lighting a
[42:59] 100 times more
[43:01] scalable uh than it is today so this is
[43:04] really useful stuff but uh it's going to
[43:08] take
[43:09] people understanding the benefits and
[43:14] like getting tired about the fact that
[43:17] they're not getting implemented right
[43:19] because that's how it work the other two
[43:20] times people have to be like come on
[43:23] give me some covidence right and
[43:27] and then the downsides all the the the
[43:29] risk you'll hear like oh but what about
[43:31] like recursive covenants the idea of
[43:33] recursive covenants is you restrict the
[43:35] flow of
[43:36] Bitcoin into some sort of like malicious
[43:39] Covenant forever right uh there's been
[43:42] multiple bets public bets of anybody
[43:44] that can come up with a malicious
[43:46] Covenant and so far nothing and the best
[43:49] the worst case in areas can come up with
[43:51] for a bad use of a covenant can already
[43:53] be done with multii multii can already
[43:56] ready do all of those so there's no real
[43:58] downside it's just that there's like
[44:00] this
[44:01] resistance to there's this like
[44:04] consensus issue we have to understand it
[44:07] and so I think I think that's the
[44:08] probably the best thing we can do for
[44:10] the future of Bitcoin right now is to
[44:11] get Covenant in um and probably Ellen
[44:16] Hans is is the best I I'm concerned I'm
[44:19] concerned that there's a future where we
[44:20] can't scale self- custody and we all end
[44:22] up in Banks and even in that world we
[44:25] still have better money so we have
[44:27] banking system on top of sound money
[44:29] that governments can't hyperinflate
[44:31] that's really good that's a huge that's
[44:34] a huge uh impact in the future that's
[44:38] like 200 years of of
[44:42] benefits but it would be a lot better if
[44:44] we could bring if we could keep the door
[44:46] to self custody open fully like there's
[44:49] a straight up door for you to grab your
[44:51] money and get the [ __ ] out and I think
[44:53] we still have that window I still we're
[44:55] still in the window where we can upgrade
[44:57] Bitcoin we might not have that in five
[45:00] years you know Black
[45:01] Rock having you know 1% of all Bitcoin
[45:05] is not good for
[45:06] softworks you know what I mean because
[45:08] maybe they don't like the softwork you
[45:10] know and and these and
[45:12] Covenant make self- custody at scale
[45:16] more secure so like they might be
[45:19] disruptors to bito or to Black Rock
[45:23] because you don't need to trust a very
[45:25] well reputable legally constrainted
[45:28] party to do self-c no onchain Bitcoin
[45:32] sort of consensus rules will constrain
[45:34] the custodian in a covenant so you don't
[45:37] need these regulatory regulated parties
[45:40] that are like you know vulnerable to
[45:41] their local governments right uh we can
[45:46] actually Bitcoin becomes a jurisdiction
[45:48] of its own that restricts those those
[45:52] wallets locally doesn't have to
[45:54] externalize that control it doesn't have
[45:57] to externalize that restriction over
[45:58] that wallet so I think Covenant are very
[46:02] very cool I I I I think we need them
[46:06] we'll be fine without them but like we
[46:08] could be a lot better off with them
[46:10] that's the thing that I think bitcoiners
[46:12] could do for Bitcoin for the future I
[46:15] think it's it's a it's a great point and
[46:17] and so it's a I mean the more overall or
[46:20] abstract Point here as you made it is
[46:23] like get educated deeper in the Bitcoin
[46:27] ecosystem uh and discuss and debate more
[46:32] on also the software uh part of things
[46:36] not just like oh I'm I'm having self
[46:38] custody I'm learning like this is all
[46:40] great stuff like having your family
[46:42] orange build having your friends orange
[46:45] build getting PE more people in the
[46:46] ecosystem buying Bitcoin running a note
[46:49] uh but then also like going deeper uh
[46:52] into the discussion like where is the
[46:54] future of of Bitcoin going uh and also
[46:58] developing the ecosystem around it
[47:00] because um we're just really early on
[47:03] and there's so much happening uh that we
[47:07] don't even know about like uh we I think
[47:10] we're around before the 2,000 years in
[47:12] the internet era and like the iPhone is
[47:16] coming out in 2007 it's like 10 years
[47:18] later and we don't even know what
[47:21] amazing things will happen to Bitcoin in
[47:24] like 10 20 30 years years uh on top of
[47:27] it what what killer applications will
[47:30] will be implemented on top of it it's an
[47:32] extremely exciting uh time I think we're
[47:35] in and it's I'm I'm I'm always kind of
[47:39] and I talk with bitcoiners and I when I
[47:40] research in the in the in the sphere I'm
[47:43] kind of thankful and grateful that I am
[47:46] like living right now in that moment
[47:49] there a lot of Great Moments to uh live
[47:52] in in the past also where like a lot of
[47:54] fundamental shift are happening but I
[47:57] think we also now living in kind of an
[47:59] very fundamental very exting times for
[48:02] sure and like like just to be clear like
[48:04] this message that I just gave about
[48:05] Covenant that's for bitcoiners that's
[48:07] for like people that have already been
[48:08] around for a while and they're looking
[48:10] for they're looking to do their tour of
[48:13] Duty they're looking to like contribute
[48:15] civically to bitcoin to the Bitcoin
[48:18] Society right but like if you're new or
[48:21] if you're just
[48:22] entering
[48:24] um there's a few ways you can help you
[48:26] know one of the things the world Bitcoin
[48:29] needs is more lighting developers we
[48:30] need a lot more lighting developers uh
[48:33] that infrastructure is going to be very
[48:34] important for the future um we need
[48:37] Bitcoin developers in general uh but
[48:40] lighning developers right now in
[48:42] particular we need a lot more there's a
[48:44] lot to do in lighting but it can be
[48:45] really great if we get it through right
[48:48] the other thing is like whatever your
[48:50] talents are there's probably a way you
[48:52] can you know include the Bitcoin cheat
[48:56] code in it right so like create like a
[48:57] Bitcoin brand of your business you know
[49:00] or start accepting Bitcoin in your
[49:01] business or grab your like put 5% of
[49:04] your business's treasury into Bitcoin
[49:07] right um or you know like there's
[49:10] probably 50 things you can do there's
[49:11] probably some value that you can
[49:13] contribute to the Bitcoin economy the
[49:14] bit the Bitcoin Society without like
[49:18] hurting your normal life right and so I
[49:20] would say consider that consider
[49:23] contributing and the reason you should
[49:25] is not because out of some you know
[49:27] great sense of virtue or because of some
[49:31] charitable humanitarian motive no
[49:35] no if you do that you your Bitcoin will
[49:39] the value of your Bitcoin will
[49:42] benefit from your input right but it
[49:44] doesn't just benefit you it benefits the
[49:46] whole of Bitcoin right so everything
[49:48] that we do collectively raises the value
[49:51] of Bitcoin if we do good things for it
[49:53] and we we make it easier to use and and
[49:55] to understand and and so on right so you
[49:59] have an investment if you have any
[50:00] Bitcoin you're invested in the future so
[50:02] it there is there's literally no
[50:04] downside to you contributing some of
[50:06] your talent in whatever whatever shape
[50:08] that takes to the Bitcoin economy um so
[50:12] yeah that's something else you can do
[50:14] and it's also beneficial uh outside of
[50:18] your Bitcoin I always put your put the
[50:21] example of the Bitcoin hotel maybe you
[50:24] have saw it in in Germany
[50:26] uh the hotel in Blen in Princess Bitcoin
[50:29] Hotel um because he took an existing
[50:35] business like this is has been around I
[50:37] think 30 years it's like a family
[50:38] business really established hotel and
[50:41] they took a risk with rebranding it uh
[50:44] they did not lose any customers uh the
[50:49] other the other way um happened they
[50:52] actually gained a lot of new faces I
[50:54] wouldn't never have been in that hotel
[50:57] if it wouldn't be for for bit for
[51:00] Bitcoin there like conferences happening
[51:02] there deep learning sessions happening
[51:04] with like 50 people 100 people uh we are
[51:07] talking now about them in in the podcast
[51:10] the same happened to Salvador who who
[51:12] who would would have talked about El
[51:14] Salvador in 2020 then they made it legal
[51:17] tender in 2021 and now then the p a few
[51:23] days ago I think two days ago
[51:26] was reelected all of the sudden
[51:28] everybody on the world kind of talks
[51:30] about him uh and I mean we have the the
[51:34] lens of Bitcoin so we it's it's it's
[51:36] it's more obvious for us but the numbers
[51:39] don't lie like tourism is up big time in
[51:42] in in Salvador so that's uh like even if
[51:46] if if you contribute to bitcoin uh you
[51:50] do something that is signaling to the
[51:53] world that you're in this and you want
[51:56] to contribute and this signal gives you
[51:59] something back uh and this is something
[52:02] amazing if you if you can participate in
[52:05] that growing
[52:06] ecosystem and this actually leads me to
[52:10] to the question uh that is our endro te
[52:13] in our endro te the previous guest asked
[52:15] the question for the next guest and our
[52:18] last guest was Jeff poof and he um
[52:22] talked about also that on the podcast
[52:24] how he
[52:26] uh transformed his time more and more
[52:29] into Bitcoin and how he encourages now
[52:32] people to get involved in this uh
[52:35] Bitcoin space and in this Bitcoin
[52:37] industry and so his question is like how
[52:40] much percentage of your like total time
[52:42] right now spending a day is spending
[52:48] Bitcoin uh yeah probably on average
[52:51] eight hours a day I'd say I mean I
[52:54] listen to I I listen to like two
[52:56] podcasts a
[52:58] day like two or three podcasts a day and
[53:01] then I'm making two podcasts a week and
[53:04] then I'm on Twitter tweeting about
[53:05] Bitcoin like probably a couple of hours
[53:08] day um and then I'm often thinking about
[53:11] it so like and I've been doing this for
[53:13] 10 years
[53:14] so
[53:17] like it's my career right like I'm kind
[53:21] of useless without Bitcoin I would have
[53:22] to start from scratch um
[53:26] but uh you know
[53:29] I I've benefited from it greatly too so
[53:31] I'm happy I'm not rich or anything but
[53:33] I'm happy right I'm I'm
[53:35] satisfied I'm I'm comfortable so you
[53:38] know I think yeah I mean I yeah I I
[53:41] definitely put in a lot of time I wish I
[53:43] I'd learned how to code younger because
[53:45] I would probably be a programmer Bitcoin
[53:47] programmer I I I managed to sort of
[53:50] manage projects you know uh Bitcoin
[53:52] development projects I got a little
[53:53] projects here and there but
[53:55] um but yeah like that's that's there's
[53:58] different ways to contribute time but
[54:01] like yeah I I'd say that that's like if
[54:05] you're getting in if you're young and
[54:06] you're hungry yeah learn to program try
[54:08] to become a Bitcoin core developer and
[54:10] at least sort of make your name there or
[54:12] or like a lightning developer and U
[54:14] that's a great way to contribute yeah
[54:16] there are so many ways you can uh get
[54:18] into Bitcoin and then
[54:21] um make a contribution to the community
[54:24] but also get something back from the
[54:25] community it's like uh both ways um
[54:29] first of all thank you H to to be on my
[54:31] podcast where can people find you where
[54:34] can people um in touch with you wal.com
[54:38] J N gt.com that's my Flagship website I
[54:43] have H I've written a variety of essays
[54:46] like long-term long-term essays on
[54:48] various topics that I think important
[54:50] there I also published my podcast there
[54:52] in English and uh it it also the podcast
[54:56] also goes on Spotify and on found app
[54:59] and on podcast atct like most of the
[55:01] apps except right now iTunes we're not
[55:03] on iTunes yet and then I have a Spanish
[55:05] version of the podcast if anybody's
[55:07] listening or has friends in Spain or
[55:09] Latin America or something that you want
[55:10] to orange pill send them my Spanish
[55:13] podcast um that one's also on my website
[55:16] it's not on the apps yet but I will uh
[55:18] well it's not on Spotify yet but uh
[55:21] it'll be it'll start um going through
[55:25] the feed soon so uh yeah we we've got
[55:28] that podcast and then yeah follow me on
[55:30] Twitter Twitter is
[55:32] good
[55:34] yeah perfect I think Twitter is like the
[55:37] space
[55:38] where the most overlapping community of
[55:42] Bitcoin actually is right now feels
[55:45] like uh thank you for being on
[55:47] appreciate it man thank you
