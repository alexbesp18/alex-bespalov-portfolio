--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] week for AI. Uh I'm going to take you
[00:02] through how it's basically impacted
[00:05] everything. Uh and I'm still going to
[00:08] basically say uh very few people since
[00:11] this is what I do for a living now when
[00:13] I'm speaking to people uh fully grasp
[00:16] the importance
[00:18] of knowing as much as they can about
[00:20] artificial intelligence. And it's moving
[00:22] so quickly. It's having such an impact
[00:24] on obviously the stock market, obviously
[00:27] our lives, but also the tariffs. I'm
[00:29] going to make the argument today that la
[00:32] basically AI ended the trade war um this
[00:35] week rare earth just ended the trade
[00:36] war. I'm going to go through a bunch of
[00:37] this stuff. So, uh I'm not reading these
[00:39] anymore because you guys can pause it. I
[00:41] like the way it came out last week with
[00:43] without me needing to do that. So, uh
[00:46] S&P I mean chart looks great. Another
[00:49] great week for stocks. We're going to
[00:50] hit all-time highs soon. We closed above
[00:53] 6,000 just above 6,000.
[00:56] uh you know the the crowd that was
[00:59] looking for a retest. After I go through
[01:01] what I'm going to show today, I would
[01:03] just make the argument that you better
[01:05] come up with a new strategy at least for
[01:07] the near term. Um finally, uh we've got
[01:10] a reverse head and shoulders slight
[01:12] breakout of IWM. It's just one day, but
[01:15] I think this is what you want to watch.
[01:16] We're still below the 200 day, but we're
[01:18] seeing it broaden out now. Uh where IWM
[01:21] is being dragged higher. Uh again, they
[01:23] have had earnings growth in in small
[01:25] caps. So there is just a valuation bump
[01:28] in this stuff that if the equity
[01:30] market's going to go higher, you're
[01:31] going to see all of them go higher. Uh
[01:33] rates, I'm just showing this because
[01:34] again, even with these little bounces,
[01:36] you'll hear people now talk about it. We
[01:37] got 10 year rates back up to 450. We've
[01:39] got 30 years just under five. Uh you
[01:42] know, it hasn't mattered. And just so
[01:45] everyone hears, so if everyone wants to
[01:47] basically do Goldman put this out, Neil
[01:49] Stephy again does good work. puts out
[01:51] the stuff that I think is important. Uh
[01:54] but showing meaning annual S&P returns
[01:56] dependent on where yields are. It
[01:58] doesn't matter what the yield is. Equity
[02:00] markets uh do well, particularly in a
[02:02] world where earnings are growing. Uh the
[02:04] dollar is the one thing so far. We'll
[02:07] see where it goes from here. Uh another,
[02:10] you know, weak week given everything
[02:11] that's going on, but the dollar just
[02:13] can't bounce at this point regardless of
[02:15] the mean reversion. We've seen a lot of
[02:17] other trades, even if it was only for a
[02:19] short amount of time.
[02:21] dollar can't do it. Um, commodities, uh,
[02:24] you know, I've I've focused a lot on the
[02:26] embodiment side. That's what a lot is
[02:27] going to be on today. I think you got to
[02:29] watch commodities going forward because
[02:31] it was silver, it was copper, uh,
[02:34] crude's trading better, uh, despite all
[02:36] the supply numbers that have come out
[02:38] from OPEC plus. Uh, if you basically
[02:42] you're up sharply since then. So, with
[02:45] everything going on, uh, you still have
[02:47] this happening. silver highest level
[02:49] since 2011. Uh copper and silver going
[02:52] up together. I think this is part of the
[02:53] electrif electrification trade which I
[02:56] think is starting to uh become a bigger
[02:58] part. Uh sentiment a ai uh unchanged
[03:02] from last week. The midline there is
[03:04] zero. We are still more bears than bulls
[03:07] uh despite the fact that we're sitting
[03:08] back up near our all-time highs. Uh this
[03:11] is the AI or no this is the investors
[03:13] intelligence. This is your denny. Uh
[03:16] again, we are barely above the lows of
[03:18] when we came in of 2022. We're barely
[03:20] above the lows of when we came out of
[03:22] the
[03:24] 2016 coming out of COVID. It just
[03:26] doesn't matter. Sentiment is still
[03:28] horrible relative to where it should be.
[03:31] Um in terms of what's been working, this
[03:33] is uh the
[03:35] revisions factor market neutral. Uh it's
[03:38] sector neutralized. So, uh, you're still
[03:41] getting winners in terms of, uh, where
[03:44] revisions are moving higher. Uh, you
[03:47] know, I wrote this piece back on April
[03:49] 3rd. Uh, I'm highlighting in here the
[03:53] importance of this. Uh, I just want to
[03:56] remind people this is like a a very long
[03:59] paper. Uh I want to emphasize the fact
[04:02] that this was all on what's happening in
[04:05] terms of shifting from a world of
[04:06] software to a sh a a world of hardware
[04:10] where embodied AI and just machinery
[04:13] with intelligence is coming and how
[04:16] important this is and the escalating
[04:19] power demands of AI seismic shift
[04:21] looming on the horizon. electricity
[04:22] consumption, the sheer scale of
[04:24] infrastructure needed for this
[04:25] revolution from data centers,
[04:27] semiconductors, energy and cooling. Uh
[04:30] all of this is where you wanted to have
[04:31] invested. Um I want to emphasize the
[04:34] point that Mark Gandreon gave an
[04:36] interview this week at the Reagan
[04:37] Foundation for the National Economic
[04:39] Forum and he basically went right at
[04:42] robotics, talked about it uh
[04:44] extensively. uh the shift to robotics
[04:47] today AI is software but there's another
[04:48] turn on AI that's coming which is turn
[04:50] to embodied physical AI predicts
[04:52] robotics will scale massively in the
[04:54] next decade becoming the biggest
[04:56] industry in history so remember Mark
[04:59] Andre has had two really good calls that
[05:01] if you just focused on this since
[05:03] technology and the digital economy
[05:04] basically took over the world and
[05:07] remember he was with Netscape so uh why
[05:10] software is eating the world was written
[05:11] in 2011 if you just went out and bought
[05:14] the mag you know what's happened. Then
[05:16] he wrote this in 2014. He did a
[05:18] Washington Post interview just in the
[05:20] months after basically saying calling
[05:22] this the most important uh innovation in
[05:25] terms of why Bitcoin matters aside from
[05:27] the internet and the personal computer
[05:30] from the digital economy perspective. So
[05:32] now Andrew E's talking about embodied
[05:35] AI. So I'm going to keep talking about
[05:37] and going through it. The reason this is
[05:39] important and the reason I think every
[05:40] single person has to spend more time on
[05:42] AI is they keep falling for
[05:45] BS. This got people out of AI. I I still
[05:49] don't understand how these two got
[05:50] people out of AI. But you have to
[05:52] remember that these things came after
[05:54] this. Everyone was bailing out of stuff.
[05:56] And I still get questions saying, "You
[05:58] don't think this is hype? You don't
[06:00] think
[06:01] this this is the easiest investment
[06:03] trade I've ever seen in terms of it will
[06:06] be accelerating over the next five
[06:08] years. Accelerating, not slowing, not
[06:10] running into caps, not having something.
[06:13] There is a race to spend as much money
[06:16] and it shows up on everything. This is
[06:18] where people need to focus their
[06:19] attention. This is not technology. This
[06:22] is a disruptive technology that has the
[06:24] crosshairs of all coding companies in
[06:26] its eyes. This is about infrastructure.
[06:29] This is about semiconductors. This is
[06:31] about hardware. This is about computers,
[06:33] phones, humanoids, everything you can
[06:36] imagine, including the military of the
[06:38] future being built. And that's where the
[06:40] rare earth part is going to come out.
[06:41] Just remember when Coreweave was
[06:43] collapsing in terms of the IPO, not
[06:45] knowing where to go and then just go
[06:48] look at where the stock price is now and
[06:50] what's gone on and the deals that have
[06:51] been done. the amount of things that
[06:54] people have been wrong about that are
[06:56] writing research reports that are
[06:58] talking about this stuff. You have to
[07:00] get involved in this yourself to
[07:02] actually understand what's happening. It
[07:04] is a powerful powerful trend with
[07:07] explosive stuff to come. The AI pair
[07:11] winners versus losers. You can see that
[07:13] since the lows, the AI trade has been
[07:15] working again, but we've been
[07:16] consolidating now for a long time. You
[07:18] had the constellation energy jump. So
[07:20] when people are questioning if the Mag 7
[07:22] were going to continue with their
[07:23] spending and Meta raised their spending
[07:26] both in December from November and then
[07:28] they raised it again at their earnings
[07:30] and now they've done a deal with
[07:32] Constellation who had done a deal with
[07:34] Microsoft a year earlier. We don't have
[07:36] enough power. We're trying to secure
[07:38] power and not a surprise that the
[07:39] Goldman Sachs power index is already
[07:41] back through the
[07:42] highs. Semiconductors. Uh the orange
[07:46] line here is the SMH. The white line
[07:48] here is the
[07:51] S&P500 semi semiconductors and equipment
[07:54] stocks. Uh I just want to say this again
[07:56] and again. First of all, you're getting
[07:57] the chance to get into something that is
[07:59] unchanged over the last year. If you go
[08:01] look at Nvidia's earnings and see what
[08:03] have happened, the stock is effectively
[08:05] unchanged at some point during July. So
[08:07] it's not too far off of a year. This is
[08:09] the beginning of an explosive move. I've
[08:11] written extensively on this. It's going
[08:13] to be spreading. Micron has been one of
[08:15] the names that I've mentioned repeatedly
[08:16] on this and on POMP as the one that high
[08:19] bandwidth memory as we move into
[08:21] inference. I went through that with VO
[08:23] last week. You have more and more of
[08:25] this going on and this is not including
[08:27] these names. So I don't see this as
[08:29] being as good for the Mag 7 as it is for
[08:32] the infrastructure side because I think
[08:33] multiple compression will continue to
[08:35] happen. But more importantly, Apple has
[08:38] screwed up the AI situation. Tesla right
[08:40] now has other events going on or else
[08:43] I'm I'm sure it would be up just on the
[08:44] speculation side of its robotic side,
[08:47] but Tesla's a robotics company. Tesla's
[08:49] an AI company. Tesla's a battery
[08:50] company, a solar company. It's not a car
[08:52] company. You're going to see some of
[08:54] these go higher, some of these go down.
[08:56] Obviously, Google's had a hard year
[08:58] because of their search business under
[08:59] attack. Apple right now, they can't get
[09:01] anything together. It's amazing that you
[09:03] can't use Siri still. Uh you've got some
[09:06] that are up. It's been a mixed year and
[09:08] I think this is going to be the way the
[09:09] Mag 7 are going to trade. I just don't
[09:11] see it as the same thing. That being
[09:12] said, you cannot be bearish, the equity
[09:14] market, if the MAG7 are just seeing an
[09:18] earnings surprise, which is as big as
[09:19] any of the things in 2013, and this was
[09:21] coming out of a recession. Again, profit
[09:24] margins, profit margins, profit margins.
[09:27] Robin Hood is just a perfect example of
[09:29] a of something that is retail, the new
[09:32] modern generation, uh, in terms of the
[09:34] way they trade, the way they get
[09:35] involved. people faded retail. It's a
[09:38] representation of retail. It's also a
[09:39] representation of crypto. Crypto is
[09:41] starting to impact the market as well.
[09:43] We saw that with Circle, which I'll get
[09:44] into later. Uh, and I just want to bring
[09:47] up something because this week from
[09:49] three different groups of people that I
[09:53] was doing presentations for when asking
[09:54] questions about AI, I keep getting the
[09:57] hallucination side. I'm going to
[09:59] hopefully nip that in the bud on this
[10:01] one. But for people who don't use it
[10:02] regularly or think about
[10:05] hallucinations, this is
[10:07] a this is a hallucination. This is
[10:10] garbage. Strategists taking down their
[10:12] numbers at the lows. So this is on April
[10:16] 24th. These are human beings making
[10:19] stupid forecast based on the tariffs.
[10:22] And I do say stupid. What is the point
[10:24] of reacting to something ever? So when
[10:26] people say that AI has hallucinations, I
[10:28] don't even know what that means. Are
[10:30] there mistakes that humans make? Are
[10:31] there forecasts that they make that have
[10:33] nothing to do with the truth? Yes.
[10:35] There's nothing about that that
[10:37] happened. Recession calls. We live in a
[10:39] world of hallucinations constantly. Deep
[10:41] fakes, fake news, everything. Everything
[10:44] that we hear from human beings on the
[10:46] markets is complete and utter garbage
[10:48] right now. And it's because they're
[10:50] following data of the past. The next
[10:51] time I hear a recession, I will do the
[10:53] same thing on it. I read Twitter all day
[10:55] long and I cannot believe how many
[10:57] people are still talking about stupid
[10:59] things like recessions. So, I'm going to
[11:01] keep going off of it. The one thing that
[11:03] is happening from AI, job losses
[11:05] continue. Microsoft, after we just went
[11:08] through showed them cutting people a
[11:11] couple weeks ago, they're firing more
[11:13] people. Again, AI is starting to have an
[11:15] impact. Walmart is supercharging
[11:17] revenue, but with fewer workers. This
[11:19] was on the FT front
[11:22] page. Here's the ADP number. Fivemon
[11:25] average has now gone down uh
[11:27] consistently and the most recent number
[11:29] was 30 something. Down here you've had
[11:32] two months in a row below 100. So we're
[11:34] seeing weakness in the payroll markets.
[11:37] Uh the NFIB showing weakness. I showed
[11:40] last week a whole bunch of things. The
[11:41] only reason I'm showing this is because
[11:42] now we're even seeing the claims, the
[11:45] four-week average of
[11:46] claims. Here was the low of the year.
[11:49] Here's now the high of the year. It's
[11:51] still at very low levels overall, but
[11:53] there is no doubt right now that the job
[11:55] market is weakening. I will say right
[11:57] now there's no recession coming, but the
[11:59] job market is continuing to show and
[12:02] there's going to be a transfer
[12:04] unfortunately from workers into profit
[12:06] margins. So corporate verse labor will
[12:08] continue to have this thing, especially
[12:10] since the tariffs have come through. We
[12:13] don't have that strong of an economy,
[12:15] especially for people in the bottom 50%,
[12:17] which means that it's going to be really
[12:18] hard to pass through all the prices. And
[12:20] if you can't pass through all the
[12:21] prices, then if you're eating it, you're
[12:23] going to replace it and find a way to
[12:25] bring more AI in and replace people.
[12:27] Here is the uh the the job numbers for
[12:30] the week in terms of the aggregate. Uh
[12:33] again, we're still in the middle of
[12:34] this. It's obviously softer than here,
[12:36] but the aggregate payroll numbers are
[12:38] still in the norm of what they were in
[12:39] the prior decade post the GFC. Uh just
[12:43] some other the hiring thing it people
[12:46] are slow to hire. They're also slow to
[12:48] fire. It's that world where people are
[12:50] just trapped because they don't want to
[12:52] hire anybody anymore. Uh forecast
[12:54] consensus is starting to come in. We've
[12:57] now got expectations of down near 60,000
[13:00] towards the end of the year. Uh that's
[13:02] mostly from the slowdown side uh in
[13:04] terms of the way people are talking. I
[13:05] think it's from the AI side. Now I want
[13:07] to break down the payroll numbers to
[13:09] make sure that everyone sees what has
[13:10] happened this year. So this is the
[13:12] monthly payroll numbers so far this
[13:14] year. So in December we had 323. These
[13:16] are after the revisions. 111 102 147 139
[13:21] very clear. If you go to this line
[13:23] education and health and services what
[13:25] you notice is consistently 60 to
[13:28] 100,000. In this most recent number, you
[13:30] have 87 here. Then you've got leisure
[13:32] and hospitality for the baby boomers.
[13:34] You combine these two. This is a baby
[13:36] boomer number. This is a baby boomer
[13:37] number.
[13:39] 135. 135. This is also a combination of
[13:42] Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security in
[13:45] terms of the
[13:46] retirees. This is what our government is
[13:48] spending money on. And to fade this is a
[13:50] problem. This is also why you buy
[13:51] Bitcoin because there's no way for the
[13:53] spending to go down because it's in
[13:54] these entitlements which we just learned
[13:56] you can't get rid of. So this is where
[13:58] the job creation is. 100% of the jobs
[14:00] here. Uh 90% of the ones here, 90% of
[14:05] the ones here. So when people are
[14:06] telling you there's a problem, here's
[14:08] the government since Alon Musk or since
[14:10] the inauguration, zero. Go through all
[14:13] of these other categories in terms of
[14:14] mining and lodging, transportation,
[14:16] there's nothing being hired here. When
[14:18] you go through information, technology,
[14:21] this is what we've been looking at.
[14:22] Zero. Financial services right now.
[14:25] They're still hiring. This, I'm sure, is
[14:27] going to start to slow down as well. So,
[14:28] I don't expect this to get better.
[14:30] There's not a recession because this is
[14:32] not a credit driven you have to fire
[14:33] people because the banks aren't lending
[14:35] to us or because our profit margins are
[14:37] coming down. This is the opposite. Here
[14:39] are the jobs per month x healthcare and
[14:42] services and leisure uh survey. So,
[14:45] we're down to 33,000. Uh this is a
[14:47] fivemon average. So, basically what you
[14:49] can see is if I tape out those two
[14:51] areas, there are no jobs being created.
[14:54] Look at these numbers over the course of
[14:55] the last two years. It's lower than any
[14:57] period in here. This is what has
[14:59] happened is you're you need more nurses.
[15:01] You need more social workers. You need
[15:03] more people to deal with the aging in
[15:05] the country. We have a shortage in them.
[15:07] We're not hiring other people and we're
[15:09] gradually having people churn throughout
[15:11] the marketplace. So, this is not some
[15:13] great market, but at the same point, we
[15:15] still have a low uh unemployment rate
[15:17] and we're going to stay there. This will
[15:18] be the next fear. I just want to get
[15:19] ahead of this because I started seeing
[15:20] these things. This is just total BS as
[15:23] well. The housing market is weak.
[15:24] Commercial real estate is weak. Uh
[15:27] commercial real estate is arguably much
[15:28] more weak than the housing market is,
[15:30] but you're starting to get people
[15:31] talking about it. So, I just want to get
[15:32] ahead because as rates go higher, then
[15:34] people are going to say that this is
[15:35] collapsing. Uh we have house prices that
[15:38] are dropping in some parts of the
[15:39] country for sure. But now we'll get
[15:41] through uh how many of the properties
[15:43] have negative equity? Close to zero.
[15:46] That's where you start running into
[15:47] problems. And look where we were in the
[15:48] great financial crisis aftermath. We're
[15:50] up at 24%. Um, and we had a problem back
[15:53] then because we had a lot lot of
[15:54] leverage. If you want to go through 120
[15:56] page report, so you can go see 120 pages
[15:59] of of charts, go to Apollo and just go
[16:02] look up their US housing outlook instead
[16:04] of wasting your time uh reading all
[16:06] these stories as people start the next
[16:08] doom and gloom thing. Uh, delinquencies
[16:10] of percentage of all mortgages sitting
[16:12] at all-time lows.
[16:16] Uh, yes, we have mortgage rates up here,
[16:18] but the average mortgage rate on
[16:19] existing homes is 4% near the all-time
[16:22] lows or at the all-time lows. So, the
[16:24] fact that rates are up here, it's
[16:25] preventing or it's really making
[16:27] affordability an issue for younger
[16:29] people. I believe this is what is going
[16:31] to cause the printing press to
[16:33] be shown up this year. Uh, you want
[16:35] voters, people can't afford homes. The
[16:38] number one thing causing problems in
[16:39] home affordability is rates at this
[16:41] point. Go. 40% of houses in this country
[16:45] don't even have a mortgage. So again,
[16:49] not a big issue. Um, all right. I'm only
[16:51] going to cover this for one second today
[16:53] because I think it's just mindless BS.
[16:55] Um, Trump tells it must lost his mind.
[16:57] Blah blah blah. This is the way I read
[16:59] this. I talked about this on Pomp. This
[17:02] just means more printing. The fact that
[17:03] Elon Musk could not find a way after all
[17:08] of the campaigning and things that he
[17:10] did, he got involved in this because he
[17:12] was worried that the country was going
[17:13] to go bankrupt. He wanted the
[17:14] deregulation to happen because he had
[17:16] moved from California to Texas
[17:18] effectively to get away from California.
[17:20] He didn't even make it in that role for
[17:23] more than three months and then he ends
[17:24] up in an all-out fight with Trump. And
[17:26] the fight was started when he was
[17:28] telling the rep people in uh districts
[17:32] to fire the pe the the politicians who
[17:36] were allowing this bill to go through.
[17:38] That triggered Trump and eventually it
[17:39] turned into something personal. I think
[17:42] this is just another sign as Luke Ramen
[17:44] says that the printing press has the
[17:46] only alternative. Alon Mus wanted to do
[17:49] what he did at Twitter, fire everyone.
[17:51] The problem is constituents and voters
[17:54] in this country. They may want change.
[17:56] They may talk about change. It may be
[17:57] something they want, but not on their
[17:59] pocket. And that's why the con the the
[18:01] the politicians always end up and that's
[18:04] why we end up in this situation. So, for
[18:06] us to turn it around, it's just not
[18:08] happening. All right, let's get into the
[18:09] trade situation now and why I'm making a
[18:12] uh a call on this. Uh maybe it's a
[18:14] hallucination, maybe it's not, but I
[18:16] just want to take you guys through the
[18:17] rare earth because I don't feel people
[18:19] realize what has gone on. Uh this week
[18:21] we started to hear as trade talks stall,
[18:24] Trump tightens pressure on
[18:25] China, new exports, be visa bans,
[18:29] Harvard news in terms of not allowing
[18:31] Chinese students to go there. And then
[18:33] around the globe, automakers race to
[18:36] find workaround to China's strangle home
[18:38] on rare earth
[18:40] magnets. China's rare earth export curbs
[18:43] hit the auto industry worldwide. These
[18:45] were news stories in Europe, in India,
[18:47] everywhere. This is not a US story.
[18:49] Remember, we were trying to isolate
[18:51] China
[18:53] after Liberation Day when Liberation Day
[18:56] wasn't working. Rates had shot higher.
[18:58] But there was something else that had
[18:59] happened that I had talked about uh back
[19:02] at the time when I thought that this was
[19:04] getting to a point that you can try to
[19:06] pull what you're pulling, but when you
[19:08] shut down global trade, there is
[19:10] something that you're going to need.
[19:12] China's rare earth gives Shei leverage
[19:14] in the US trade duel. It's going to
[19:16] prove to be an understatement. Uh,
[19:18] China's trade war gambit puts Trump on
[19:20] defense. Okay, this is the checkmate
[19:23] side of the big picture. China's control
[19:25] of global rare earth supply has left the
[19:27] US playing defense in a trade war of its
[19:29] own design. So I want to make sure that
[19:32] people can go do their own homework on
[19:34] this. So this came out from the center
[19:36] of strategies of international studies
[19:38] back on April 14th. Ap on April 4th,
[19:41] this is the Saturday after liberation
[19:44] day. So, China's Ministry of Commerce
[19:47] imposed export restrictions on seven
[19:50] rare earth elements and magnets used in
[19:52] defense and energy and automotive
[19:54] sectors in response to the
[19:56] tariffs. Within this article, they go
[19:59] through a ton of different reasons that
[20:00] this is a major deal. Uh, are rare earth
[20:04] what are rare earth significant national
[20:06] security? Basically, everything in the
[20:09] military. So, the United States is
[20:11] already on its back foot when it comes
[20:12] to manufacturing. China's rapidly
[20:14] expanding munitions production, advanced
[20:16] weapons, and equipment at a pace five to
[20:18] six times faster than the United States.
[20:20] While China's preparing for a wartime
[20:22] mindset, the US continues to operate
[20:24] under peaceime conditions. It talks
[20:26] about the extreme nature of it being
[20:28] between 90 and 99% control of the rarest
[20:33] from China. So, what happens this
[20:35] week? Trump announces rarest Magnus
[20:37] trade agreement with China. Uh there is
[20:41] no deal at this point. There's just an
[20:43] acknowledgment that they have to go to
[20:44] the table. Which is why when the news
[20:47] comes out and it first says Trump says,
[20:48] "Yeah, I'll fly to China." Uh yeah. And
[20:51] the Chinese papers say, "We she took the
[20:53] call from Trump." The whole situation of
[20:56] we're going to put tariffs in response.
[20:58] We'll go to 100. Okay, fine. You're
[21:00] going to 100. We're going to go to 140.
[21:02] Everything has changed. And so you look
[21:04] for dynamics in the market that impact
[21:06] people are still thinking that the China
[21:08] US side is going to break apart. The
[21:10] problem is that means the rare earth
[21:12] side which I'm going to show you is
[21:14] critical and we've been getting more and
[21:15] more stories about how critical it's
[21:17] become. So China approved on Friday
[21:20] temporary export licenses of rare earth
[21:23] suppliers to the top US automakers.
[21:25] That's it at this point. The rare
[21:28] minerals battle behind Rubio's ban on
[21:30] Chinese students. So now we're going to
[21:32] bring Marco Rubio into this because he
[21:34] becomes important. So this Axiius
[21:37] article made the point that the rare
[21:39] earth mineral is what drove
[21:43] this. Now you can go watch this video.
[21:46] Rubio spoke at the New World Gala. Uh
[21:49] it's it it's not a long thing or you can
[21:51] just go in and and to chat GPT and bring
[21:55] it up. But this becomes important in the
[21:57] discussion as you're trying to find out
[21:59] about rare earth. Uh and I'm telling
[22:01] you, I've had more conversations with
[22:03] people. I remember I was on a trip in in
[22:04] London uh for a lunch and I had talked
[22:07] with people about rare earth being the
[22:09] reason for Greenland and Trump uh and I
[22:12] was laughed at and said that was all
[22:13] about military in terms of of that I
[22:16] just don't think people realize how
[22:17] important AI is to everything and that
[22:19] the historical world like ships and
[22:22] battleships and stuff. This isn't about
[22:24] this. This is about a world of drones
[22:26] and humanoids and artificial
[22:28] intelligence and AGI. It has nothing to
[22:30] do with the things that you learned in
[22:31] textbooks. there was none of this. So
[22:34] all of that stuff has become almost
[22:36] useless in terms of thinking about the
[22:38] world or thinking about markets. What's
[22:40] driving everything right now including
[22:42] decisions is where things are going to
[22:44] be 3 years from now related to AI
[22:45] because it's moving at a pace that is 10
[22:48] times. So for every year it's like 10
[22:50] times of innovation and this has become
[22:52] crit critical because as Mark or as
[22:55] Marco Rubio talked about China has
[22:57] deliberately cornered the market of rare
[22:59] earth processing. This dominance gives
[23:00] them a global leverage since railways
[23:02] are essential key technologies, defense
[23:03] systems and electronics. The US and
[23:05] allies are now vulnerable to economic
[23:08] coercion because critical supply chains
[23:10] are dependent on an adversarial nation
[23:12] state. This is what he said during this.
[23:15] Unless we fix it, the amount of leverage
[23:17] China will have on us will begin to
[23:18] constrain our ability to make foreign
[23:20] policy. If you listen to the entire
[23:22] speech, you hear him talk about how he
[23:26] didn't realize we were in this
[23:27] situation. that after 25 to 30 years of
[23:30] allowing China to take over this
[23:32] critical part of the future of defense
[23:35] and again nobody understood how
[23:37] essential these elements would be. Rare
[23:40] elements are essential to high-tech
[23:41] industries and defense manufacturing.
[23:44] It's all in one country. So imagine if
[23:47] one country had all the oil. Well, this
[23:49] is a similar thing. And this is just to
[23:52] make sure. EU picks 13 new critical
[23:53] materials projects including in
[23:55] Greenland. Um, so the EU is basically
[23:57] now trying to make sure that they get
[23:58] their hands on it. Everyone around the
[24:00] world is is scrambling for this. I wrote
[24:02] something for 22V on Brazil this week
[24:04] called the trade uh of embodied AI era
[24:07] dollar weakness of global trade
[24:08] ordering. Uh I love Brazil in this and
[24:10] one of the major reasons is the rare
[24:12] earth. If you want to get it, reach out
[24:13] to the 22V uh people to read more on it.
[24:16] Uh, it was good enough that it made the
[24:18] front page of a blog in in uh in Brazil
[24:21] on their financial side because I guess
[24:23] people aren't spending too much time
[24:24] being positive on Brazil. I love
[24:26] scenarios where I'm buying things uh at
[24:28] incredibly low levels. Is AI driving
[24:30] demand for rare earth elements? The
[24:32] semiconductor that drive AI development
[24:34] require a wide variety of elements some
[24:36] of which are hard to come by? Is supply
[24:38] meeting demand in this new
[24:40] technology? AI is changing the world.
[24:42] Technology for all its surreal qualities
[24:44] has a basis in the material world. That
[24:46] is the transformation we are making. We
[24:49] are going from the software world now to
[24:50] the materials world again to show it
[24:53] back to the man Mark Andre talking about
[24:57] it and that now is the time we're
[25:00] shifting from it. So the guy who wrote
[25:02] software is eating the world is now
[25:04] saying we're leaving the world of
[25:05] software and now we're getting into the
[25:06] world of embodied AI. Uh, Amazon
[25:09] prepares to test humanoid robots for
[25:11] deliveries. It's all this week,
[25:14] guys. Uh, Whimo surpasses Lyft on track
[25:18] to pass Uber in the next 12 months. Here
[25:21] is the chart. Market share of driverless
[25:25] cars in San
[25:26] Francisco. This will pass Uber in the
[25:30] next 12 months. They're spreading across
[25:32] the country. It takes a lot more rare
[25:36] earth and a lot more memory and a lot
[25:38] more everything for embodied AI. So the
[25:42] semiconductors and all the things we're
[25:43] going we're getting into the hardware
[25:45] side. You're going to get into how
[25:46] important this is. Uh AI will make
[25:49] everything so cheap it'll break the
[25:51] economy. Those who understand us will
[25:52] build generational wealth. Those who
[25:54] understand us will build generational
[25:56] wealth. This is part Bitcoin. Okay. Time
[25:59] is running out. Here's how to prepare
[26:01] yourself. So if you want to go read up
[26:03] on this, you can go there. Power CEO
[26:05] says US to lose race to China without
[26:07] new lines. Uh again, we're getting to
[26:10] the point of we need large quantities of
[26:13] electricity. Uh we are currently trying
[26:15] to set up a awesome trip to spend time
[26:18] on power, small nuclear uh plants,
[26:22] humanoids,
[26:23] and one of the massive data centers and
[26:26] go through this. I highly recommend that
[26:29] people uh start thinking about this
[26:31] stuff uh because I think this is going
[26:32] to be the investment theme for the next
[26:34] multi-year in terms of people needing to
[26:36] focus on it. Amazon plans to invest 10
[26:38] billion in North Carolina to expand
[26:40] cloud
[26:41] computing. Saja Nadella's new AI
[26:43] battlecry at Microsoft again now we're
[26:45] getting into the agentic side which also
[26:48] takes a tremendous more power and
[26:50] compute compute compute compute. Uh
[26:54] China is already taking off on the agent
[26:56] boom. Manis is a Chinese one. I've used
[26:57] this. I don't think I did it on this,
[26:59] but I've used it and demoed it before.
[27:01] Uh, Perplexity CEO sees AI agents as the
[27:05] next web battleground. Again, this takes
[27:06] tremendous more compute for AI agents.
[27:09] McKenzie just put out a new report uh
[27:11] this week. The future of work is
[27:13] agentic. Uh, again, this is happening
[27:15] very very fast. And then
[27:18] PWC talked about the productivity grow
[27:21] uh in this uh a little more optimistic
[27:23] on the job side which I tend to agree
[27:25] with meaning I don't see this as a a
[27:27] decimation of jobs but I do see this as
[27:30] critical. Uh the one thing I'm going to
[27:32] give you guys as homework uh if you want
[27:34] to catch up and at least hear someone
[27:36] who's brilliant talk about AI and the
[27:39] way the world's going to look. Uh again
[27:41] I tried to listen to a podcast this
[27:43] week, a macro one. I made it through 10
[27:45] minutes, turned it off some guy around
[27:47] my age or maybe a little bit older, uh,
[27:49] going through the history of why the US
[27:51] is doomed, why the stock market is
[27:52] overvalued, and I just gave up after a
[27:54] few seconds because I've heard all the
[27:56] act before. Uh, I just can't listen to
[27:58] anyone unless they're going to bring AI
[28:00] into it. Uh, so as long as you bring AI
[28:03] into it, I'm happy to listen. But if
[28:04] you're going to talk about old stuff,
[28:06] uh, and not bring it up, this is worth
[28:08] more. He's not an economist. He's not a
[28:11] stock market person, but to see how he
[28:13] has a better view of what the world's
[28:14] going to look like a year from now, two
[28:16] years from now, everything else. That's
[28:17] why it's critical to go listen. So, go
[28:19] listen to that. The highlights, uh, AGI
[28:22] before 2030, the societal outlook,
[28:24] predict short-term job turn, which is
[28:26] what I think we're in now, but eventual
[28:28] radical abundance as AI fixes resource
[28:31] bottlenecks. Think fusion, think every
[28:34] possible thing you can come up with in
[28:36] terms of rare earth, everything. urges
[28:39] schools to teach meta- skills,
[28:40] creativity, adaptability, learning to
[28:42] learn, and envisions personal AI,
[28:44] attention protector, shielding users
[28:45] from grabbing. Maintains that human
[28:48] creativity keeps its edge. I just want
[28:51] to tell you, I get called out more from
[28:54] people to talk about how they can learn
[28:57] to use AI. As I've said, I use it all
[29:00] day long. It's impossible for me to
[29:02] figure out. I give gave up on how many
[29:04] hours because I use it for everything.
[29:06] Uh I everything I can't even describe
[29:08] there's not a single decision I make in
[29:10] my life unless it's a guaranteed 100%
[29:12] that I'm making the decision I want to
[29:13] make where I don't use it and very few
[29:16] people use it at all and the reason is
[29:17] because of again this nasty word of
[29:20] hallucination which Demis Hassabis
[29:22] refers to as move 37 the most famous
[29:25] thing in artificial intelligence during
[29:27] the Alph Go
[29:28] side was a powerful example of a
[29:31] hallucination AI coming up with
[29:33] something
[29:35] new. That's what makes this brilliant.
[29:38] That's why I love brainstorming with it
[29:40] all day long, verbally, verbally,
[29:43] talking to it all day long on my AirPods
[29:45] as I walk around, creating new papers,
[29:47] creating new thoughts, things that I do
[29:49] in this video, asking it if I want to
[29:51] get something from my own substacks. I
[29:53] talk to it and say, "Hey, can you
[29:54] reference when did I which which
[29:56] substack post did I do that in?"
[29:57] Everything that I have, it has
[29:59] everything on the internet. So, I'm just
[30:01] going to continue to reiterate that if
[30:02] you don't want to do it for yourself, he
[30:04] brings through and says for
[30:06] kids, they need to be using it every day
[30:09] as well. If you want to have a job in
[30:11] the future and you're in your 40s, you
[30:14] better be using it every day. Your 30s,
[30:16] you better be using it every day. Your
[30:17] 20s, you better be using it every day.
[30:19] If you don't care about yourself, but
[30:21] you care about your kids. They need to
[30:22] be using it every single day. And to do
[30:25] that, they need to see you using it and
[30:27] not saying, "I want you to write this
[30:28] thing. I don't want you to sit there and
[30:30] go through it. If you like the stuff
[30:31] that I do in Substack, those are all
[30:33] brainstorming with AI. I come up with
[30:36] the ideas. I do the majority of the
[30:38] writing, but I create every paragraph. I
[30:40] create the theme. You have to start
[30:42] realizing that that's the most important
[30:45] thought. Imagination, hallucinations,
[30:48] their
[30:53] imagination. I had a prompt put
[30:55] together. Here's a prompt template you
[30:57] can copy and reuse to help one. This is
[30:59] just when you do anything uh research,
[31:01] deep research, and you want to check the
[31:03] hallucination. Just go in there and say,
[31:05] "Can you check this for me?" And this is
[31:07] I created a prompt for it in two
[31:09] seconds. I create prompts every single
[31:11] day or I have it create the prompt for
[31:13] me. And then when I write when I have it
[31:14] do some research for me and it comes
[31:16] back with a 20 range report, I will then
[31:18] put this in and go, "Will you please
[31:20] fact check this exact thing?" and then
[31:22] it'll come through and if there's
[31:23] anything in there that it can't find or
[31:25] it doesn't know what's or it's
[31:26] factchecking it's going through it which
[31:28] means it's just taking more time on the
[31:29] stuff it will help it will reduce it
[31:32] they're already being reduced as it is
[31:34] now I just want to do a little bit of
[31:35] work here for people because I've
[31:37] started to do this on the consulting
[31:38] side uh for 22V if other hedge funds
[31:41] asset managers want to go through it I
[31:43] think the majority of the software that
[31:45] you get is a waste of time uh my own
[31:47] personal opinion bringing this stuff and
[31:49] having it come in uh this is about
[31:51] teaching ing people how to use it and
[31:52] most of the stuff that you can get
[31:54] online is far better in my opinion and
[31:56] you don't have to bring your own data
[31:57] in. So Broadcon came out this week. They
[31:59] had just made new all-time highs. Uh
[32:02] it's one of the semiconductors. I'm
[32:03] spending a lot of time. So at the end of
[32:05] it, I'm just having it go through. Give
[32:06] me all the highlights from the earnings
[32:08] call. This is in
[32:09] perplexity. So it goes through it. So I
[32:11] picked this piece in here, the demand
[32:14] supply, because I'm interested. Demand
[32:16] for Broadcom's AI networking chips and
[32:18] custom accelerators remains insatiable.
[32:20] It's these types of words that I want to
[32:22] find because then I want to go find out.
[32:24] The company's AI network business grew
[32:26] over 170% year-over-year and now
[32:28] accounts for 40%. So, their stock is
[32:30] down because it was at all-time highs
[32:32] and it almost doubled. So, I want to go
[32:34] find other companies because what I
[32:35] believe is happening is we're going to
[32:36] now be spreading this to other areas. We
[32:38] we are entering the hardware side. This
[32:41] is no longer just about the software
[32:43] side where Nvidia and Broadcom had a
[32:45] huge advantage. I think we're spreading
[32:46] this out and I want to go find other
[32:48] places. So, I go in uh for this comment
[32:51] uh about the 170% year-over-year for the
[32:52] Eastern
[32:54] ESP. Can you go give me other places
[32:57] that are likely to benefit? So, it gives
[32:59] me all these companies likely to
[33:01] benefit. Oh, one of them here is Cisco,
[33:03] which has been part of my embodied AI
[33:06] uh paper that I wrote a long time ago.
[33:08] So, I go into Cisco. All right, Cisco's
[33:10] on my list. Let's go in. How are they
[33:13] benefiting? And then you go through and
[33:15] you get all of the areas where they're
[33:17] seeing the same exact thing, where
[33:18] they're growing. But then you also find
[33:20] out where else they're growing from.
[33:22] They're also growing on the cyber
[33:23] security side. So you're trying to
[33:24] figure out if a company that big has
[33:26] many areas where they're growing and
[33:29] where they're feeling the benefit from.
[33:30] For Micron, it had traded very well this
[33:33] week. I've been focused on it. Uh it
[33:35] broke through 100 and then it headed all
[33:37] the way up to 110 today or this week.
[33:40] And it was a big week. Micron traded
[33:42] well this week. what are the main
[33:43] reasons? And then it goes through the
[33:45] things that had happened, changes that
[33:46] had happened, anything that happened
[33:47] during the week. All of this takes
[33:49] seconds. I dig deeper on it. I go do
[33:52] some more work on it. And then
[33:54] eventually we go through and create an
[33:57] idea. These are both names that were
[33:58] part of my embodied top- down AI piece
[34:00] that I did back in in April. These are
[34:03] now two ideas on the call spread side
[34:05] based on Cisco and Micron because we not
[34:08] only know that they're going to benefit,
[34:10] but what Broadcom said and what the
[34:13] inference paper I said is that we're in
[34:15] that sweet spot now. You can't do this
[34:18] with the banks. I'm sorry. They can't
[34:20] possibly keep up with the ability of
[34:23] doing this that quickly to generate
[34:25] massive reports. They're too busy with
[34:27] phone calls. There's too going there's a
[34:28] reason why I'm not going to an office.
[34:31] There's a reason why I'm doing this at
[34:32] home. I couldn't possibly work in an
[34:34] office and be able to do as much work as
[34:36] I'm doing. So, if you guys want some
[34:37] help, I've been doing some presentations
[34:39] on how to use perplexity, how to use AI,
[34:41] how to use these prompts, how to think
[34:42] about things, how to take Bloomberg
[34:44] charts, put them into AI, have it
[34:46] analyzed for you. Uh, we're still using
[34:48] John Rogue because John's good and John
[34:50] goes through it. We combined on this
[34:52] Cisco and Micron and we added this in.
[34:53] So you can get a complete picture as a
[34:55] portfolio manager that you had to depend
[34:57] on your trader and your analyst and you
[34:58] can have you can go do all this work
[35:00] yourself or the people that work at your
[35:03] firm can get better at it and start
[35:04] using it where they're quicker and it
[35:05] gives them more time to follow more
[35:07] names and to do the work with inside
[35:09] this incredible tool that's real time.
[35:12] Uh Bitcoin final part of the week
[35:14] Bitcoin been consolidating you traded
[35:17] back to the 50 for some reason. You had
[35:20] this lawn Mustang. We broke down, came
[35:22] right back up.
[35:25] Uh the number one thing in my opinion
[35:27] that now is holding back Bitcoin from
[35:30] the next break, which will come higher,
[35:32] uh is the fact that the utility tokens,
[35:35] the innovation tokens, the ones that are
[35:38] really going to benefit the most from
[35:39] the network effects of stable coins have
[35:41] not jumped higher yet. Uh I think this
[35:43] is a hangover from the 202122 period.
[35:46] This reminds me in the fiat world of the
[35:49] post.com bubble time where there were a
[35:51] lot of people I know a lot of people
[35:53] that had left the banks and had left the
[35:56] um uh the regular jobs back in 2021
[36:00] during that quote unquote yolo period uh
[36:03] were trading crypto. I talked about my
[36:05] son's time. But I know a lot of these
[36:07] people. They got involved in the
[36:08] markets. They got involved in crypto and
[36:10] they own a bunch of tokens that uh had
[36:12] collapsed. They bounced and I just think
[36:14] there's an overhang. That's what
[36:16] happened in the.com bubble. Uh lots and
[36:18] lots of businesses are in that trouble.
[36:20] We just have not had a big move. And if
[36:23] you do charts of these names, this is
[36:24] Ethereum related to Bitcoin. They're all
[36:27] sitting at lows. I don't care which one
[36:29] it is. There's been nothing really
[36:30] that's gone higher except for Fartcoin.
[36:32] Uh everything else that was around pre
[36:35] uh 2022 has had a really hard time, but
[36:39] we failed at the 200 day moving average
[36:40] and I think we're getting closer to
[36:42] breaking out. Uh, Salana's had the same
[36:44] type of thing. I'm looking at the 200
[36:46] day moving average is important. I think
[36:48] the catalyst is coming. One of the
[36:50] catalysts is small cap stocks. This is
[36:52] IWM overlaid with Ethereum. Uh, Ethereum
[36:55] held down here, but small caps broke
[36:57] through. They both have a reverse head
[36:59] and shoulders. They've both been
[37:00] correlated. I do think we're getting
[37:02] closer and closer. Uh, I wanted to just
[37:05] I'm not going to go through all of
[37:06] these. Bitcoin to me is still going to
[37:08] have a major spike this year. That's my
[37:10] opinion. Um, I don't I don't get paid
[37:13] for giving you guys advice on this
[37:14] stuff. Uh, but I do believe that Bitcoin
[37:16] is going to have a very large surprise
[37:18] to the upside. I'm not going to go
[37:19] through with the target, but between the
[37:21] macro reasons and the network effect,
[37:24] innovation reasons, everything lines up
[37:26] to me with government support
[37:28] everything. So, you guys can spend your
[37:30] own time on it. But I do think it's
[37:32] going to happen. We had a major IPO
[37:35] debut this week with Circle coming
[37:37] through. Stock was up massively. uh
[37:40] circle IPO leaves 1.7 billion on the
[37:42] table. Seventh biggest underpricing in
[37:45] decades. You've had lots of of M&A and
[37:48] lots of stuff going on inside. In fact,
[37:51] every week I'm highlighting things that
[37:52] are just not happening in the regular
[37:53] world. The deals we're seeing in the
[37:55] fiat world are all related to power uh
[37:57] and people getting nuclear power. Here's
[37:59] the stable coin market cap. How do you
[38:03] not want to invest in something that's
[38:05] moving like this? This was the period
[38:07] back in 21 to22 that I referenced. We
[38:09] saw stable coins go down. Then we
[38:11] started seeing them go back up again in
[38:13] the beginning of 2024. And now this is
[38:16] just highlighting the amount
[38:18] of size that is being built up. One of
[38:21] the most important things going on in
[38:23] the marketplace today. We have a bill
[38:25] that we're waiting for in terms of the
[38:27] Genius Act to get through. And then once
[38:29] that's through, we're going to have a
[38:30] bunch more stuff going on in crypto this
[38:32] year. uh stable coins settled over 11
[38:34] trillion in transactions surpassing
[38:36] Visa. Uh that was in
[38:38] 2024. Uh AI agent stable coins in front
[38:42] of I've I've connected these two. This
[38:44] is why you get agents. Stable coin
[38:46] volumes go up dramatically. Wallets go
[38:48] up dramatically. The digital economy
[38:50] ecosystem grows and then Bitcoin grows.
[38:53] Bitcoin grows because there's the going
[38:55] to be wallets that are being created for
[38:57] transactions rather than people hiding
[38:59] money. This is where we get the network
[39:01] effects. This is what Mark Andre talked
[39:03] about a decade ago when he wrote the
[39:05] paper on Bitcoin and why it matters.
[39:07] It's just starting now, which means
[39:09] 100,000 is still way too low relative to
[39:12] where it's going to be, even though it's
[39:14] becoming very quickly one of the largest
[39:15] assets in the world. I will continue to
[39:17] highlight it in this the same way AI for
[39:20] everyone who is still focused on we're
[39:22] going to have a depression, we're going
[39:23] to have a recession, we're going to have
[39:24] this, we're going to have that, there's
[39:25] going to be defaults. This has all been
[39:27] about AI and crypto. The reason I do
[39:29] this is because of the only two frigin
[39:31] things that matter for you guys at this
[39:33] point. But you want to focus on what
[39:35] Ford is doing and what GM is doing and
[39:37] how we're going out of business. None of
[39:39] that matters. It doesn't matter. You
[39:41] have to focus on AI. You have to trade
[39:44] your way through it. But if you're
[39:45] waiting for rate cuts or you're rated
[39:46] for rates to break higher to 6% or 7%
[39:50] and think that's going to be the holy
[39:51] grail by the time you're done, go figure
[39:53] out how much money it's made to wait on
[39:54] that stuff. It just doesn't matter. last
[39:57] two charts, Senator Lumis has
[39:59] highlighted a pathway to build America's
[40:01] Bitcoin reserve. This came out this
[40:03] week, so we'll find out what eventually
[40:05] happens. And of course, Donald Trump Jr.
[40:06] says his family's all in on Bitcoin
[40:09] because they were debunked. So, when you
[40:11] hear the Democrats saying, "We want X
[40:12] and we want Y in this." The family is uh
[40:16] angry because they were part of the
[40:17] debanked group, fade them if you want,
[40:20] but he's going to be president for
[40:21] longer and he wants Bitcoin to go
[40:23] higher. So, if you want to fade it,
[40:25] fine. But now we found out that AI has
[40:28] to be hub because we're running we don't
[40:30] have rare earth. So that's it for this
[40:32] week guys. Uh reach out if you want. I'm
[40:35] thinking about doing a video uh around
[40:39] AI and how to use it. It would be a
[40:41] longer form thing. I would probably take
[40:43] some time, but I've had a lot of
[40:44] requests from people for themselves in
[40:47] the industry, outside the industry, and
[40:49] I think for their kids. Uh, I'm going to
[40:51] figure it out and work on it over the
[40:53] course of probably the summertime. But,
[40:55] uh, maybe it'll be out sooner.
