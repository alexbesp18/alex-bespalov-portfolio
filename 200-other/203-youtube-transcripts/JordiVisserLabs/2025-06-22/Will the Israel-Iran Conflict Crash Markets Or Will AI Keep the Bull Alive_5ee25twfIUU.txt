[00:00] to it. Um, I'm not going to read all
[00:02] these. uh we'll go through it but I do
[00:04] want to make the point that uh this
[00:07] week's video is mainly again uh about AI
[00:11] and stable coins but the most important
[00:14] thing is it's I'm I'm going to go
[00:17] through how this is the exponential
[00:20] point and how a lot of the other things
[00:22] that people are talking about and going
[00:24] through now that the China US situation
[00:26] in my opinion as I said last week is
[00:29] officially over and we are now in a
[00:31] whether you want to call it a truce, uh,
[00:34] a separation, as I called it, with Pomp.
[00:37] Uh, it doesn't really matter. China and
[00:38] the US have come to some kind of
[00:40] agreement that they have to live with
[00:41] each other while they're figuring out
[00:42] how to get this divorce done. So,
[00:44] they're in mediation at this point. Um,
[00:46] so I'm going to focus a lot on just the
[00:49] places that I think people should be
[00:50] focused on because the economy is going
[00:52] to become more confusing, not less. Uh,
[00:54] S&P,
[00:56] we're basically just below the highs. We
[00:59] obviously saw a little bit of a
[01:00] correction on the back of the Iran uh
[01:03] Israel situation. Uh best guess here's
[01:07] what we did last year during the Somu
[01:09] panic when we sold off. Uh see that
[01:11] three-wave move in Elliot wave term.
[01:13] Same thing here. Impulsive move higher.
[01:16] We did a correction. I would not be
[01:18] surprised to see us kind of get back
[01:21] into this area. Maybe even fill the gap
[01:23] here. So, I'm expecting uh some some bit
[01:28] of a correction here. Uh we should be
[01:31] getting into the blackout period for
[01:32] buybacks and things like that as we get
[01:34] closer to the earnings report. So, it
[01:36] would not surprise me to see us spend
[01:38] time before we get through the all-time
[01:40] highs. uh the S&P last week a lot went
[01:43] on China US and then uh you had the
[01:46] fears about Iran about Israel uh in Iran
[01:49] and then we had the reality of it and
[01:51] the S&P basically was down 39 basis
[01:53] points for the week. So again a lot of
[01:55] drama both on the positive side and the
[01:57] negative side and nothing came of it.
[02:00] Small caps broke out this reverse head
[02:02] and shoulders formation got to the 200
[02:04] day and then pulled back. Uh I still
[02:08] think that's a place to watch just to
[02:09] see if we get any kind of expansion. Uh
[02:12] the big story to me continues to be that
[02:14] no matter what happens, sentiment is
[02:16] bearish, everyone's bearish, positioning
[02:18] is bearish, but the dollar does not
[02:20] bounce. There is clearly more and more
[02:23] hedging uh going on. And even though
[02:26] we're going to have a bounce at some
[02:27] point and maybe we consolidate here, you
[02:30] have to start looking at if you can't
[02:31] rally on anything, stock market falls,
[02:35] dollar falls. Stock market rallies,
[02:37] dollar falls. We have a geopolitical
[02:40] event with a a war and the dollar
[02:44] doesn't budge. Uh 30-year auction. This
[02:47] is what's going to happen. And this is
[02:48] why I keep saying the most frustrating
[02:50] thing for macro people is continuing to
[02:56] play the bond market as the easy trade.
[02:58] It is not the easy trade. It will never
[03:00] be the easy trade. Um Morgan Stanley
[03:03] who's had a good call this year. Mike
[03:04] Wilson's had a good call. You know,
[03:06] really did make the argument to be
[03:07] buying stocks down in the near the 5,000
[03:10] level. Um now saying there's a new bull
[03:14] case for stocks that's emerging.
[03:16] completely agree with as I go through
[03:18] this. Uh, but I'm not going to call it a
[03:19] bullcase. I'm just going to call it this
[03:22] messed up economy and messed up macro
[03:24] world that is all about artificial
[03:26] intelligence in crypto when very few
[03:29] people actually understand artificial
[03:31] intelligence in crypto, which is why I
[03:33] do this video every week for you guys.
[03:34] Um, earnings revisions are heading
[03:36] higher now. So, you've got revisions
[03:38] breath going down. Last time we saw a
[03:40] bounce like this, not surprisingly, this
[03:42] was at the end of 22 um when we came out
[03:45] of the rate hike cycle. So again, people
[03:47] scared about tariffs going through their
[03:50] usual doom and gloom stuff. And again,
[03:53] we have another doom and gloom thing
[03:54] that people can start to focus on. Uh
[03:56] it's amazing that if you go to Bloomberg
[03:58] Saturday and you go look, the top five
[04:01] stories are all on this um macro is now
[04:04] going to be dominated by this. Just to
[04:08] go through AI. Historically, over the
[04:10] last 25 years, when Israel involved in a
[04:12] conflict of war, how long does it
[04:13] normally take for markets to stabilize,
[04:16] this is why you don't have to read the
[04:17] papers. You don't have to do anything.
[04:18] Just go to artificial intelligence and
[04:20] ask it the question on everything in
[04:22] your life. I can't make this any more
[04:24] clear than I do in these videos. Uh,
[04:26] historically, markets tend to stabilize
[04:28] quickly after the onset of Israel
[04:30] related conflicts, usually within days
[04:32] to a few weeks. Are there scenarios that
[04:34] it could be worse? Yes. But we're not in
[04:36] the game of focusing on the tales. We're
[04:39] in the game of focusing on the
[04:41] probability distribution. And you use
[04:43] history. The world typically isn't
[04:46] ending regardless of what goes on. We've
[04:49] been uh Russia Ukraine when it first
[04:51] came out. Uh oil, the highest price for
[04:54] oil over the last 15 years occurred less
[04:56] than a week and a half after the
[04:58] invasion. And it's still going on. and
[05:00] oil prices went from a peak of 133ish
[05:03] all the way down to 55ish. Uh so it does
[05:07] not pay to trade geopolitical events and
[05:09] sit there and waste money on puts and
[05:11] things like that. Uh I believe there
[05:13] will be consolidation here, but I do not
[05:16] believe that the China Israel or the
[05:18] Iran Israel situation is something to be
[05:20] bearish on. And by the time we get
[05:22] through the end of the week, my guess is
[05:24] there will be arguments as to why this
[05:26] could actually be bullish. uh meaning
[05:28] maybe this is kind of another step
[05:30] forward in the Middle East getting
[05:32] through a lot of the issues. Uh I just
[05:35] don't think anyone knows but I do know
[05:37] this only focusing on the left tail of
[05:38] the distribution is a big mistake. Uh
[05:41] the China US situation new step forward
[05:43] basically agreed what they agreed in
[05:45] Geneva sort of uh China found the
[05:47] world's pain point on trade and we'll
[05:49] use it again. Rare earth I talked about
[05:51] it for two weeks. Uh the papers finally
[05:53] got a hold of it. I think everyone
[05:54] started to reach out to me and wonder
[05:57] where I came up with this stuff and went
[05:59] through it. This is the beauty again of
[06:01] focusing on artificial intelligence and
[06:03] crypto as the bulk of your reading. Uh
[06:05] for those of you that have read seven
[06:07] articles on Iran Israel today, I'm going
[06:09] to tell you, you're not going to get
[06:10] anything useful out of that from a
[06:12] trading perspective because you're
[06:14] missing the stuff that's happening on
[06:15] AI, which I will go through. Um this is
[06:18] the interesting part that wasn't
[06:20] announced. So China agreed to give us
[06:23] rare earth.
[06:25] The question is what did we give them?
[06:28] Uh certainly not just the visas and
[06:30] things that were announced. So a lot of
[06:32] speculation that on the semiconductor
[06:34] side there will be uh certain semis that
[06:36] are announced that are going to go
[06:37] there. We'll see if that's the case. Um
[06:40] one of the things Scott Besson said
[06:41] which I think is important as part of
[06:43] the mediation uh China leaders want
[06:45] their economy to focus on more
[06:47] consumption while US leaders want their
[06:48] economy to focus more on production. The
[06:50] good thing is for for the global economy
[06:52] on this, this means both focused on
[06:55] growth. I'm going to re reiterate this.
[06:58] Both China and the US to get out of this
[07:00] problem are focused on growth. End of
[07:02] story. So when you're looking at the
[07:04] tariffs about what go on, yes, whatever
[07:06] number you come up with on the tariffs,
[07:08] great. Good calculation. 300 billion. I
[07:10] don't really care. It's a small number
[07:11] when you compare it to what's going on
[07:13] in AI. But these guys are going to spend
[07:15] money on growth. that's where their
[07:17] focus is going to be is the same exact
[07:19] thing. We need growth. We need negative
[07:22] real rates. We need whatever we want.
[07:24] The debasement continues. Spending money
[07:26] continues. Uh
[07:29] China vows more efforts to stabilize
[07:31] property market. This came out the two
[07:34] days after uh the whatever went on in
[07:37] London. Uh China taps $ 1.5 trillion
[07:40] fund to boost home market support. If
[07:42] you didn't read this, basically go read
[07:45] it. I mean, they're doing stuff similar
[07:47] to what we had to do in the US post uh
[07:51] the great financial crisis. So, they're
[07:53] printing money. Uh inflation, this is
[07:56] becoming a bigger story. At at the end
[07:58] of last year and into the beginning of
[07:59] this year, I talked openly that at some
[08:01] point this year, there would be an
[08:03] inflation fear. Um, we've now reached a
[08:06] point with the tariffs that I think
[08:09] people have to start reassessing,
[08:10] including myself, what's going on in
[08:12] inflation because there's something else
[08:15] happening here. And I think it's related
[08:16] to AI and this is not some deflationary
[08:19] story on the service side. I think this
[08:21] is a deflationary story on what AI is
[08:23] doing to the jobs market in terms of
[08:25] fear, what the tariffs are doing in
[08:27] terms of fear and the spending that is
[08:29] being impacted from it. Not in terms of
[08:31] again a recession, but in terms of this
[08:34] bifurcated situation where if 50% of the
[08:37] people in the country feel like they're
[08:38] living in a recession, inflation is
[08:40] going to reflect that. It's not going to
[08:41] reflect the wealthy people. Um, and so
[08:43] if the stock market is going higher and
[08:45] it's creating more wealth, no chance of
[08:48] a recession when you add in the the AI
[08:50] side, but I think the inflation stuff is
[08:52] starting to get in there. So Warren
[08:54] Pies, he basically, you know, he put out
[08:56] the core goods negative month over
[08:58] month. core goods. We're already
[09:00] starting to see some of the tariff
[09:01] stuff. So whether it's appliances, there
[09:03] are little parts in here that are
[09:05] showing it, but in the aggregate it's
[09:08] not super corp second lowest reading
[09:10] since last summer. 06 month if not for
[09:13] tariffs. Fed would be cutting. I
[09:14] completely agree uh that they would be
[09:17] cutting at this point despite you know
[09:19] everything happening. The the economy is
[09:21] is uh is fine but it's only fine for a
[09:25] very small portion of Americans. So,
[09:27] here's the super core number. We're at
[09:29] 2%.
[09:30] We kind of stabilized here. But when you
[09:32] go into the guts of things and you look
[09:34] at the month overmonth numbers, there's
[09:37] a couple things that stand out. First of
[09:38] all, if you just look at the last four
[09:40] months, you know, you're basically
[09:42] dealing with a very very small number.
[09:45] If you look at the change from last
[09:47] year, so look at the super core month uh
[09:50] monthly numbers. So June was low. That's
[09:53] where we're entering next month. But
[09:55] then the July reading, the August
[09:57] reading, the September reading, the
[09:58] October reading, the November reading,
[10:00] the December reading, January, which is
[10:03] an outlier. Again, these two January
[10:05] numbers are big. But regardless of that,
[10:07] you've had this softness in here. And
[10:09] the biggest change to me is this thing
[10:12] here, which is effectively airline
[10:14] tickets. Airline prices are down 7.9%
[10:17] year-over-year. And again, I think this
[10:19] is an economy thing. I think this is
[10:21] people worried about jobs. I think this
[10:23] is people worried about the tariffs and
[10:25] the inflation. So, it's acting as a
[10:27] suppressant right now. And so, no matter
[10:29] where you look in the super core
[10:31] numbers, uh this is the 12-month change.
[10:34] This gets you that 2.8 number. But no
[10:36] matter where you go, this is six month,
[10:38] which is coming in right now at about
[10:39] 2.4% annualized. Then you go here, this
[10:42] is the fourmonth, which means this is
[10:44] coming in right now at about, you know,
[10:47] the last four months at about uh less
[10:49] than 1%.
[10:51] So no matter where you go right now, the
[10:53] inflation stuff is weak. And go another
[10:56] route. We had 73 estimates for this uh
[11:00] inflation number. The core number was
[11:02] lower than any of their forecasts. When
[11:05] you start seeing those kinds of anomaly,
[11:07] you have to shift it lower. And Goldman
[11:09] is doing the same thing. They say in
[11:11] light of the more limited tariff effect
[11:13] this month, offsetting deflationary
[11:14] maintenance is coming from forces. So
[11:16] when you start thinking about how wrong
[11:18] people were on inflation, how wrong they
[11:20] were on the recession, the question is,
[11:23] is the economy weak, and I'm going to
[11:24] keep saying it over and over again, that
[11:26] the jobs market is not recessionary, but
[11:30] it is softening, which means wages are
[11:32] going to come down, which again is a
[11:33] negative inflation
[11:35] um impact, but in particular, you're
[11:38] dealing with high netw worth people are
[11:41] doing fine, which is a very small
[11:43] portion of the economy, but inflation is
[11:45] about the average person. It's not about
[11:49] the wealthiest person. And that's the
[11:51] way a lot of these indices are going to
[11:52] show up. And so the data is going to be
[11:54] there. This is here. Uh if you can't see
[11:57] it, make your screen bigger. This is the
[11:59] services PMI which came back down near
[12:02] the bottom end. The claims four-week
[12:04] claims inverted. It continues to just
[12:06] soften. This is continuing claims which
[12:08] broke out and people are having trouble
[12:12] getting a job once they get on
[12:13] unemployment. Um, and that's that's just
[12:16] what it is. We're not at any levels, and
[12:18] again, I'm going to keep saying it.
[12:19] We're not going into recession, just
[12:21] like I said last week, but I do think
[12:23] jobs are heading towards very low levels
[12:25] of close to zero. And healthcare and
[12:28] leisure and and travel are the only
[12:30] places that still are creating jobs and
[12:33] there's less travel going on. So, would
[12:35] not be surprising from for in my opinion
[12:37] to see the the jobs numbers keep
[12:39] tracking towards zero.
[12:41] Uh Trump obviously wants rates cut. He
[12:44] was out there again saying we need to
[12:46] cut them. But this time everybody
[12:48] joined. So JD Vance goes in and calls it
[12:50] monetary malpractice. Howard Lutnik went
[12:53] on there and said it should happen now.
[12:56] And Trump called Pal a numskull. So the
[12:59] pressure is on there. And Paul Tudtor
[13:01] Jones was on Bloomberg this week and he
[13:04] basically said Trump is gonna we only
[13:06] have a we have less than a year left of
[13:08] Powell and he's probably gonna appoint
[13:10] an uber dovish thing. He talked about
[13:13] exactly what I brought up which is
[13:15] they're they've they've made the
[13:16] decision to grow their way out which
[13:18] means they're going to run inflation
[13:19] hot. He specifically mentioned what
[13:21] Japan is doing where Japan is reluctant
[13:23] to raise rates higher because when they
[13:25] tried to raise rates higher it created
[13:27] uh some sort of a tantrum. So what they
[13:30] have is inflation in Japan is running
[13:32] way above where where rates are. So in
[13:35] the US, he wants rates below the
[13:37] inflation rate because that's the way
[13:38] they're going to try to get out of this
[13:40] problem. So uh he spoke on this. I'll
[13:44] get more into what he said later on.
[13:46] Luke Groman, same thing. Put it in
[13:48] there. Uh he was highlighting the fact
[13:50] that De Besson's already his 333. Um
[13:54] they're trying to get it under four. So
[13:56] now he's mentioning four. Uh again the
[13:58] same thing significantly negative real
[14:00] rates for a sustained period or a brief
[14:02] period of face peelingly negative real
[14:04] rates which mean really juicing
[14:06] inflation uh which uh again you're
[14:09] you're dealing with a point where uh
[14:12] they're going to have to do something to
[14:13] debase uh foreign investors continue to
[14:16] focus and talk about this is becoming
[14:18] again this capital issue this taxes on
[14:21] foreign investors a proposal in the
[14:23] house version of the bill levy a 20% tax
[14:26] on foreign investors I've talked about
[14:28] it on here every week, but it continues
[14:29] to be a news item because it isn't out
[14:32] of it yet. But you have another issue,
[14:34] too, which is this was on the front page
[14:37] or yeah, in the Financial Times this
[14:38] week, central banks are beginning to
[14:40] fret about dollar swap lines. This is
[14:41] another place where
[14:44] in the article, ECB has asked its banks
[14:47] to report vulnerabilities around their
[14:49] dollar exposures and the influential
[14:50] think tank has now called for US central
[14:52] banks to create a mutual pack to prepare
[14:55] for worst case things. So, the non US
[14:57] central banks, they're trying to figure
[14:58] out how to deal with this stuff. Uh
[15:00] they're raising their purchases of gold.
[15:02] They're making deal swap deals with
[15:03] China. And then it brings up the
[15:05] Kindleberger trap. Uh warning that
[15:08] turbulence erupts when a dominant
[15:10] geopolitical power loses the ability or
[15:12] desire to support reserve currency.
[15:15] That's where we are. I fully believe the
[15:17] American people voted to not have the
[15:19] global reserve currency. I think AI is
[15:22] going to worsen the situation for the
[15:23] voters, meaning it's going to hurt the
[15:25] jobs market. It's going to suppress
[15:26] wages at a time when inflation is high
[15:29] uh higher. Uh and this is going to
[15:31] continue to be an issue because
[15:32] inflation is going to be both good for
[15:34] the stock market and profit margins, but
[15:36] it's not going to be it's going to be at
[15:37] the expense of labor, which means this
[15:39] pressure that has been here and been
[15:41] causing the debt to go higher will
[15:42] continue to be there. That's why we're
[15:44] doing these videos. Um tenure rates did
[15:46] not act well on
[15:49] the Iran Israel situation. Uh tenure nor
[15:53] will rise today on Friday. further
[15:55] reinforces that it's they're acting
[15:57] unusual. Again, just another form of
[16:00] this not being the same type of
[16:02] environment that it was in the past.
[16:04] Again, I highlighted the dollar. Here it
[16:06] is down here. Didn't move. Tenure rates.
[16:07] You can barely tell that there was any
[16:09] kind of a major conflict that erupted uh
[16:12] with Israel and Iran. This was the big
[16:14] macro news of the week. If you guys
[16:16] didn't find it in your macro writeups
[16:18] and your cross asset market, I'll take
[16:19] you through it. Oracle hits record after
[16:22] seeing dramatically higher sales. So
[16:24] let's go through what specifically was
[16:26] said. Go to Perplexity. Here are the
[16:28] growth rates. Okay, this is a half a
[16:31] trillion dollar company. These are the
[16:34] kinds of numbers that are not a
[16:36] recession. So I'm going to keep saying
[16:37] it. The US economy is growing nominally
[16:40] maybe at 4% this year. Maybe we can get
[16:43] back. We can we can stay around five,
[16:45] but let's assume it's 4 and a.5%. These
[16:47] are the types of numbers during a boom.
[16:49] This is what you want to invest in. This
[16:51] is why the stock was up 13% despite the
[16:53] fact that it's a half a trillion dollar
[16:55] company. As you go through all of these
[16:57] different parts of their business, all
[17:00] of them growing 100% greater growth
[17:02] expected.
[17:04] You you're dealing with something right
[17:06] now that people faded the AI thing not
[17:09] that long ago. Here are the words that
[17:10] Larry Ellison described on the demand.
[17:13] astronomical and insatiable
[17:16] highlighted that Oracle received an
[17:18] unprecedented order from a customer, one
[17:21] customer willing to take all available
[17:23] capacity regardless of location, Europe,
[17:26] Asia, or elsewhere, underscoring the
[17:28] breath and urgency of demand across the
[17:30] markets. Never again should people fade
[17:32] the AI demand story. As I go through
[17:34] this, I don't know how to make it more
[17:36] obvious to people. This is the story.
[17:38] It's not about bombs happening in the
[17:40] Middle East. Aside from the human
[17:41] element, it has nothing to do with the
[17:43] market over this at this point. If it's
[17:46] going to end the way that historically
[17:47] has ended, they need to build data
[17:49] centers, deploy infrastructure. It takes
[17:51] time. Adding 47 new multicloud data
[17:55] centers. The astronomical demand is
[17:57] driven primarily by enterprises rapidly
[18:00] adopting Oracle cloud infrastructure for
[18:02] AI workloads.
[18:04] This is just the beginning. I want to
[18:06] repeat enterprises rapidly adopting. No
[18:10] enterprises are using AI yet. This is
[18:13] just starting. This only happens with
[18:16] inference. This demand is so large that
[18:18] customers are willing to consume all
[18:19] available capacity, prompting Oracle to
[18:21] take massive capital investments to
[18:23] expand data centers and network
[18:24] abilities.
[18:27] the numbers that they're doing and
[18:30] they're adding in they said that they
[18:32] will be doing over 25 billion in capital
[18:35] expenditures for 2026
[18:38] as to deal with the bottlenecks that are
[18:40] there. So I this is Oracle basically
[18:45] coming out again half a trillion dollar
[18:47] company been around a long time go look
[18:49] at the chart up 13 14% on f uh up uh on
[18:53] the day of the earnings
[18:55] openai who has obviously a major uh uh
[19:00] partner in Microsoft signing a cloud
[19:03] deal with Google for more compute
[19:06] Microsoft is completely supply
[19:07] constrained when it comes to GPUs
[19:09] they're growing open is growing so fast.
[19:11] And again, I've shown this every single
[19:14] week. They're adding Oracle to those
[19:16] compute partners. This is just nonstop
[19:18] in terms of seeing it. And it's global.
[19:21] Nvidia, we had Jensen Yuang uh speak
[19:24] this week and he said 10-fold increase
[19:26] in Europe's AI computing power on the
[19:29] come. So, everyone globally, we've seen
[19:32] the Middle East, we're seeing Europe,
[19:33] this is not just a US story, this is a
[19:35] global story. This is why regardless of
[19:38] how weak the economy looks from the
[19:39] traditional measures, it is because of
[19:41] the distribution of wealth problem. Uh I
[19:45] wanted to highlight just Anna Nicole
[19:48] Yfski because uh I've been highlighting
[19:51] semis. Um she's obviously a
[19:53] wellrespected person in the space but I
[19:56] cared because she was also a negative
[19:59] person in the space. So over the course
[20:01] of the last two weeks uh she's been
[20:03] highlighting microchip pre-announces
[20:05] positively business performing better
[20:07] than expected. I'll tell I'll I'll
[20:09] describe why this is important. O
[20:11] semiconductor confirm seeing signs of
[20:13] recovery in analog. The reason this is
[20:16] important this is the embodiment side.
[20:19] This is the industrial side. This is the
[20:21] auto side. This is all of the things
[20:22] that I've talked about is showing up
[20:24] now. uh Micron which I've highlighted in
[20:28] here has ripped higher from you know
[20:30] it's doubled in the last month or or two
[20:34] months no month and a half uh their DRAM
[20:37] price is jumping after memory makers
[20:38] announced they will cease module
[20:40] production of the DDR4
[20:43] so I will show you DRAM prices in a
[20:46] second but the reason she's important
[20:48] again she was on TV because she finished
[20:50] fourth in the in the Robin Hood
[20:52] Foundation behind Mark Allen
[20:55] Bill Aman, Dr. Miller. She finished
[20:57] fourth. Her short pick was tech. So,
[21:00] this is someone that was negative, not
[21:01] short tech anymore. Long DRAM and Amalog
[21:04] semis. It's a big shift. Um, I don't
[21:07] think people expected it. I just wanted
[21:09] to highlight again another thing. So, I
[21:11] showed you last week the um S&P 1500
[21:15] semis. The white line here is the equal
[21:18] weight socks. So, equal weight uh semis.
[21:21] The reason I wanted to show this is
[21:22] because any kind of cap weighted
[21:25] semi-index is going to have a very high
[21:27] percentage of it being Broadcom and
[21:29] Nvidia. The benefit with the equal
[21:31] weight is now you're getting to see more
[21:32] of the analog and the things that will
[21:35] benefit from the old traditional
[21:37] hardware story. The thing that I'm
[21:39] saying is now about to spike violently.
[21:41] That also matches up with the pink line
[21:43] here. This is the Cosby. So the Cosby
[21:45] overlaid with the semis. They all
[21:47] peaked. This is also the Taiwan stock
[21:49] exchange. things Taiwan semi all of them
[21:52] peaked together Asia's leading the way
[21:54] higher but Korea in particular is busted
[21:56] out I think of these as a supply chain
[21:58] story everything is happening with
[22:00] inside seminary spot price update so
[22:04] again DDR5 four and these these are the
[22:06] commodities you need to know not oil
[22:09] these are the commodities you need to be
[22:10] focusing on this is where we have
[22:12] massive shortages this is like the
[22:14] colonization of China which was
[22:17] happening from 2002 to 2008 eight. Uh,
[22:20] this will be a repeat with the data
[22:22] centers. What Oracle showed you, think
[22:23] of it as the colonization of China. What
[22:26] do we need to own? What as a hedge fund
[22:28] should we be focused on? Here are the
[22:30] DRAM prices. This is for the uh the five
[22:33] uh lap, the new one just going higher.
[22:38] Oh yeah, I didn't show on that. I just
[22:40] want to make sure you guys can see this
[22:41] is all the price changes. This is now
[22:43] for June. So, it's actually advanced
[22:45] from where I just showed that 513 was
[22:47] the chart I just showed you. Here it is.
[22:49] here, every single one of them higher in
[22:52] the subsequent months. So again, 513,
[22:55] 514, now it's up at 570.
[22:59] This is from the automotive uh uh side.
[23:02] This is an S&P global mobility march
[23:04] tracker. I just want to highlight out.
[23:06] Uh the automotive semiconductor market
[23:08] is undergoing structural change driven
[23:10] by evolving vehicle architectures.
[23:13] The embodiment of AI, this is a
[23:15] completely new thing. uh rising demand
[23:18] for electrification, automation and
[23:20] connectivity. Hybrid vehicles are
[23:22] gaining share uh shifting towards high
[23:26] level autonomous driving. This is where
[23:29] we are. We're going to have shortages.
[23:31] Um and they mention it in here. So the
[23:34] semiconductor side is it and what's
[23:36] going on. This is the SMH. This is SMH
[23:40] over the S&P. This is semis versus tech.
[23:44] This is the XLK. And this is the
[23:46] percentage of names above the 200 day
[23:48] moving average. No matter where you look
[23:49] right now, semis are in a beginning
[23:51] thing. And again, they are down from
[23:53] where they were in July of last year. So
[23:55] you're getting an acceleration here. Why
[23:57] are we having this now? I listened to
[23:59] this interview. Uh it's about two hours
[24:01] with Sundar Pchai and Lex Friedman. Uh,
[24:04] and he made the comment that I'm I'm a
[24:06] little mad I didn't um see this, but he
[24:09] made the comment that the tokens that
[24:12] Google processed uh themselves in the
[24:16] month of
[24:18] uh I guess it was April was 50 times
[24:22] higher than a year earlier. So, here's
[24:24] the growth. There's two things I want
[24:25] you to highlight. Number one, 50 times
[24:28] is a big number. This little inflection
[24:30] point here, this is two weeks after
[24:33] DeepSseek. So what Deepsee ended up
[24:36] doing is forcing all of the US AI
[24:40] companies to release their reasoning
[24:42] models faster. So at the time he talked
[24:46] about Jeban's paradox that what Deepseek
[24:48] would do was get more people using
[24:50] reasoning, using inference because it
[24:53] was free, it was open source, more
[24:55] people were going to use it. Well, it
[24:57] not only helped in that manner, but it
[24:59] forced all of these companies to release
[25:01] things faster than they would have. So,
[25:03] this is the growth rate that's
[25:04] happening. It's parabolic. This is what
[25:06] you want to invest in. This is what you
[25:08] want to talk about. This is what you
[25:09] want to be on top of. Not whether oil
[25:11] goes from 68 to 73 and then back to 69.
[25:15] You're not going to make money trading
[25:16] that. Whether 10ear yields go from 438
[25:18] to 452, this is the story. This is the
[25:22] digital economy. So, what does that
[25:24] mean? Well, it's also across industry
[25:27] and again this is now not using
[25:29] Google's. This is using from AlphaSense
[25:32] putting stuff together. This goes
[25:33] further back. And again, right here,
[25:36] this is DeepSeek. Nothing had changed in
[25:39] terms of token consumption. It was still
[25:41] sitting in the same level. The LLM usage
[25:44] was all there. This was the moment
[25:46] inference kicked off and we got this
[25:47] parabolic move. We're about to see it go
[25:51] into machinery. This is just on a
[25:54] computer. This is before agents keep
[25:56] going. This is before the enterprise
[25:57] adoption. Go back to what I showed you
[25:59] in Oracle. This is the beginning of
[26:01] this. This is not the end of it. So,
[26:03] everyone who is worried, everybody I've
[26:04] met over the last 3 months through 22V
[26:07] who's a power person, we are now going
[26:09] to go through what I've talked about. It
[26:11] is time is now. So, now I took this
[26:15] snapshot that I took from from uh from X
[26:19] his post and then I put it into chat GPT
[26:22] and I said here's a chart. Please
[26:23] analyze this and give me an estimated
[26:25] electricity needs today and extrapolate
[26:26] this growth rate out next year. So, two
[26:29] things I want to show you. If you're not
[26:31] using AI like this, call up 22V, pay
[26:34] them some money. I'll come in and I'll
[26:36] go through and I will do a demo of how
[26:38] you guys can do this stuff
[26:39] instantaneously. Same thing with the
[26:41] Iran Israel side. We are multimmodal.
[26:44] The need to use these tools is
[26:46] astronomical in terms of the way that
[26:48] Larry Ellison said it. You have to be
[26:50] using it. So, here's the analysis. I
[26:52] just put it in convert again tokens into
[26:55] electricity.
[26:56] It does the math. I didn't give it any
[26:58] of the numbers. It looked at the
[27:00] snapshot. It goes through the growth
[27:02] rate 50 times in 20 months, 3900%
[27:05] year-over-year.
[27:06] Assumption energy cost. Now, again, this
[27:09] is saying GPT3.
[27:11] And I'll go through why that's important
[27:12] later. Um, but here's the approximate
[27:16] tokens. This is the approximate energy
[27:18] use. that's comparable to the annual
[27:20] electricity usage of the Netherlands.
[27:24] Extrapolate that to May 26. So it now is
[27:27] doing this. It's again using GPT3
[27:30] inference. I will go back and talk about
[27:33] why that may not be exactly the the
[27:35] right way to go, but regardless that's
[27:36] more than half of global annual
[27:38] electricity production today. So this
[27:40] assumes that it's 50 times and it
[27:44] assumes that there's been no efficiency
[27:46] gains, which is not going to happen.
[27:48] They will the inference models as they
[27:50] get released will continue to get more
[27:52] efficient and they will use less. So 50
[27:55] times that's being there. So what's a
[27:57] realistic view? Again, I didn't ask it
[27:59] to do this. It did it on its own. A
[28:01] second 50 times jump is unlikely due the
[28:03] physical infrastructure limits of GPU
[28:05] availability by Nvidia and electricity
[28:08] supply by power companies. But 5 to 10
[28:11] further growth is plausible. AI agents
[28:14] would be part of the reason. Autonomous
[28:16] AI pipelines, widespread LLM usage via
[28:18] smartphones and enterprise. These are
[28:20] all things that we're preparing for an
[28:22] embodiment. This is just confirming it.
[28:24] This is not me telling it what to do.
[28:26] This is it doing it. So, it's saying
[28:28] using these more reasonable. And again,
[28:30] I'm not so sure that we're not going to
[28:32] far far far surpass that. The reason
[28:36] that this is more reasonable is they're
[28:37] getting back to
[28:40] forecast that Goldman and McKenzie. I'm
[28:42] gonna say this is going to be higher
[28:43] that whatever efficiency gains we get
[28:45] will probably not be there. The reason
[28:47] that we wouldn't be able to get to 50
[28:49] though is because we just don't have the
[28:50] physical infrastructure. So this is
[28:52] where the buildout and the frontloading
[28:54] of GDP has to happen because this is a
[28:56] race at two levels. And I'll say it
[28:58] again. You have a race for AGI for the
[29:00] hyperscalers. They believe if they lose
[29:03] this, there's obsolescence. Their
[29:05] business is gone. I'll get into that. At
[29:07] the same time, they're in a race with
[29:08] China. This is a powerful thing where
[29:10] it's coming from free cash flow from the
[29:13] hyperscalers. And we have to do this in
[29:15] the race against China in terms of the
[29:17] way that the Trump administration
[29:18] believes it and the way that it's being
[29:20] whether that's true or not, AGI is
[29:22] there. That is the reality is what is
[29:24] believed in. And that is why this is the
[29:26] economy. This is what matters. This is
[29:28] where you want to focus. AI token usage
[29:30] is becoming a proxy for energy demand.
[29:32] The hypers scale energy footprint could
[29:34] exceed some countries in less than 18
[29:36] months. Many main major beneficiaries,
[29:38] power producers, utilities, gas and
[29:40] nuclear players, and AI chip makers
[29:43] constraints will appear in the grid
[29:44] capacity situation bubble. So if you
[29:46] don't believe that and you go, I believe
[29:48] there's hallucinations in there. I'll
[29:50] show you what you do. I use Gemini 2 and
[29:52] a half pro, the highest rated model at
[29:55] this point. I put in what its results
[29:57] were and I said, "Do you agree with this
[29:58] analysis?" Again, this is how you
[30:01] eliminate not only hallucinations, but
[30:02] you get a second analyst that is equally
[30:05] as smart as the first analyst to give
[30:07] you their views of the situation. And
[30:09] this time, in short, I agree with the
[30:11] general conclusion mathematically, but
[30:13] with significant caveats regarding the
[30:15] This is why you do this stuff. I'm not
[30:17] going to go read all of this, but what I
[30:19] am going to show you as you you get in
[30:22] the conclusion. While there is a
[30:24] mathematical error in the state of Earth
[30:26] growth, the core calculation is sound.
[30:28] The analysis hinges entirely on the
[30:29] validity of two key numbers, the
[30:31] projected tokens. And again, this is
[30:34] where it is. If AI usage continues to
[30:37] grow exponentially, its energy
[30:38] consumption could soon be on par with
[30:40] that of entire developed nations. It
[30:43] effectively highlights a major challenge
[30:46] for the AI industry and global energy
[30:48] infrastructure. You have to have major
[30:50] positions in energy at a time when
[30:52] energy is not built up. There's no
[30:55] movement going on. Amazon this week
[30:57] joins the party. We've I every week I
[30:59] show a different last week it was meta
[31:01] with constellation. When you see these
[31:03] companies just hoarding for it, EIA
[31:05] projects record US data center power. AI
[31:08] crypto because of uh AI crypto boom
[31:12] uh Black Rockck growing power man as
[31:14] policy managers rethinking the trade-off
[31:16] between this is just a major topic at
[31:19] this point and honestly the energy space
[31:21] is not moving that much. Now on top of
[31:22] the embodiment side on April 24th I
[31:25] released this long form deep research uh
[31:28] Colin Fenton phenomenal works with 22V
[31:30] we went through it. He wrote what glut
[31:33] and talked about it uh about again we've
[31:37] got issues uh electrify and amplify this
[31:41] was all on the connection between them.
[31:43] If you haven't seen it you can go read
[31:44] it uh but I I would just go through it.
[31:47] So one thing I'm doing this week I will
[31:49] be doing a uh some stuff on Chevron just
[31:53] to show. So can you go through all of
[31:55] the company commentary and earnings
[31:56] highlights on Chevron? I wanted to go
[31:59] see its connections to AI and what's
[32:02] going on and some of the things that are
[32:03] in the public space on this that this
[32:06] came up with which I'll include in the
[32:07] trade piece. It just shows how you start
[32:10] using AI to get a top-down side and then
[32:13] you end up in Chevron's AI data center
[32:16] power initiatives and you get to read
[32:17] all of the things that are already
[32:19] there. Like I said, some of the
[32:21] statements that I'll highlight, they're
[32:22] mind-blowing in terms of how prepared
[32:25] they are for this, the gap that exists
[32:27] before the power gets on from nuclear.
[32:29] There is a a massive need that is here
[32:31] and we don't have the power needs, which
[32:33] is why these guys are buying up as much
[32:35] nuclear that already exists, but that's
[32:37] not enough for the next 5 years. So,
[32:40] this is where we are now. We've gone
[32:41] from the AI demand side which we saw
[32:44] from Oracle the semiconductor needs
[32:46] which is the short of exponential growth
[32:48] that's going to happen and people have
[32:49] not yet seen what embodiment means at
[32:52] the same time the power needs those are
[32:54] not built in this is old school hardware
[32:57] commodity related investing at a time
[32:59] when there's been underinvestment for
[33:00] the last 17 years because this has all
[33:03] been about the cloud and software SAS
[33:05] companies are going to be obliterated by
[33:08] AI hardware companies are going to be
[33:10] need for build out um phenomenal uh uh
[33:15] YouTube podcast to read to watch this
[33:18] week. It's two hours and 20 minutes, but
[33:20] it's Pier Dearandis, three other people.
[33:23] They go through and debate the job
[33:25] situation. They also go through the AI
[33:27] warfare. There's a massive amount of
[33:29] buildout that needs to happen on the
[33:31] military side, which is part of this
[33:32] hardware as well. You're already seeing
[33:34] it in the differential between what
[33:36] Israel is able to do and what Iran is.
[33:38] You have to start paying attention to
[33:40] what's happening on that war more so
[33:43] than Ukraine and Russia. Mainly because
[33:47] Israel is using the most cuttingedge
[33:49] technology at this point and a lot of
[33:51] the things that you're reading about are
[33:52] unbelievable in terms of their ability
[33:54] to do stuff. Everything is changing in
[33:56] the world depending on whether you have
[33:57] AI or don't have AI as a big buildout.
[34:00] You need the power. You need this. It's
[34:01] a huge differential between the halves
[34:03] and the have nots. Spend the time on it.
[34:05] Um, inside the video, one of the things
[34:08] that's interesting, startup to billion
[34:10] dollar valuation speed. Again, this is
[34:11] going to become important as I go
[34:13] through this. In the past, it took a
[34:14] 100,000 people to build a billion-dollar
[34:16] company. The number shrank to 50,000 in
[34:17] the 80s, 10,000, 2000s. A future of zero
[34:21] person startups is possible. Agents
[34:23] founding and running companies. This is
[34:25] why all software companies are going to
[34:28] be obliterated over time. Uh, coding is
[34:30] now ubiquitous. I don't care who the
[34:32] software company is. I don't care if
[34:34] it's Google. I don't care who it is.
[34:36] Eventually over time, whether it takes
[34:38] 10 years, 9 years, 8 years, 7 years, 6
[34:39] years, but the future longduration
[34:42] assets, I'm going to say that again, if
[34:44] you were invested in VC and private
[34:46] equity companies, my own opinion is how
[34:49] you can do that where rates stay up at
[34:50] higher levels uh than where they
[34:52] necessarily would on the long end. And
[34:54] at the same point, we have AI
[34:56] accelerating making it very difficult to
[34:58] understand where things are going to be
[34:59] in the future. That combination is very
[35:02] very dangerous for long. The competition
[35:04] will be accelerating at a pace that is
[35:06] beyond belief. Uh competitive intensity
[35:09] is so high that a singularity sprint is
[35:11] underway. An anxious rush to launch
[35:13] before others make you obsolete. Listen
[35:15] to it. You'll get the smartest people
[35:17] talking about it. The jobs destruction.
[35:19] AI isn't just replacing jobs. It's doing
[35:21] so faster and more broadly. They talk
[35:24] about why this isn't the same as the
[35:26] steam engine and all that stuff, which
[35:28] if it's not clear to people, this is a
[35:30] completely different scenario because
[35:33] the machines are figuring out ways to
[35:35] solve the problems on their own. They're
[35:37] working 24 hours. They have brains.
[35:39] There's reinforcement learning. They're
[35:41] learning along the way. They're not
[35:43] being helped by the human beings.
[35:44] They're not button pushed. The only
[35:46] thing that needs to happen is they need
[35:47] to be plugged in. That's it. Um, Moaba
[35:51] Gadat uh predicts 10 to 40% unemployment
[35:54] in some sectors. Same thing as Dario
[35:56] Modai. That's where they go through.
[35:58] Governments are not prepared for the
[35:59] speed of change. This gets back into the
[36:01] unemployment rate and the fact that
[36:02] their job is to print money to keep this
[36:05] change from happening fast. They're
[36:06] going to have to print more money. Call
[36:08] for UBI trials, 4-day work week pilots.
[36:10] These are all things that they're saying
[36:12] are going to have to happen. I wrote a
[36:13] paper on this. Entrepreneurship is the
[36:15] last job standing.
[36:17] The only future proof career is
[36:19] entrepreneurship, education. You have to
[36:22] get away from training to get a job.
[36:24] Don't pick a major. Just go and go
[36:26] through this. All of this stuff for your
[36:28] kids. Pay attention. Just go through it.
[36:31] If you had any doubt, this was Ilia,
[36:34] formerly of uh AI and one of the smarter
[36:37] people out there on AI saying the same
[36:40] thing. Uh the day will come when AI will
[36:42] do all things we can do. The reason is
[36:44] the brain is biological computers. So
[36:46] why can't the digital computer do the
[36:47] same thing? It's funny that we are
[36:49] debating if AI can truly think. Um
[36:54] Zuckerberg is basically putting all his
[36:57] chips on the table. He literally
[36:59] invested 14 billion in scale AI to hire
[37:04] Alexander Wang. So he's creating a
[37:08] secret super intelligence lab to pursue
[37:10] beyond human AI. He's going all in to
[37:14] speed up this process. And one of the
[37:16] reasons why at this point is chat GPT5
[37:19] rumored for July 25th launch. Um, this
[37:23] is the fir if you haven't if you're not
[37:25] prepared for this, I'm about to take you
[37:27] through. Um,
[37:30] this has been talked about as the most
[37:31] serious candidate yet for a pre- AGI
[37:34] foundation. So, basically, this would be
[37:36] the acceleration at this point of what's
[37:39] happening with AI. it would be the point
[37:41] that gets us to the next level. Um, if
[37:45] you want to read something or bring
[37:47] something into chat GPT as I did here in
[37:50] the paper situational awareness by
[37:52] Leopold
[37:53] Ashen Brener, what did he say about the
[37:55] importance of eventual releases, the
[37:57] eventual release of GPU T5? So, he's an
[38:00] open AI uh researcher. He wrote this I
[38:04] think it's 165page
[38:06] uh paper called situational awareness
[38:08] the decade ahead and although he didn't
[38:11] specifically mention GPT5 what he talked
[38:14] about was effectively sometime before
[38:18] 2027 we'll move from chatbot so what
[38:20] most people know to agent in his words
[38:22] by 2027 rather than a chatbot you're
[38:25] going to have something that looks more
[38:26] like an agent like a co-orker and
[38:28] strikingly plausible that by 2027 models
[38:30] will be able to do the work of an AI
[38:32] researcher engineer here. So the fact
[38:33] that GPT5 is looking to be released next
[38:37] this next month um this would be the
[38:40] accelerant GPT5 equals AGI catalyst uh
[38:45] and again this is from his paper operate
[38:47] as an agentic colleagues trigger the
[38:50] recursive self-improvement path to super
[38:53] intelligence. So again, the recursive
[38:55] self-improvement where they're teaching
[38:56] themselves. Uh this is now we're getting
[39:00] into another level. Now, did he mention
[39:03] the power needs associated with that
[39:05] world?
[39:07] He forecast that by 2026 training
[39:09] clusters will demand, and I'm not going
[39:10] to go through all the numbers,
[39:12] representing 20% of current electricity
[39:15] production.
[39:17] uh it'll be limited due to data centers
[39:20] and warehouses comparable to building or
[39:22] integrating hundreds of power plants
[39:24] into the grid. He even expects national
[39:27] scale mobilization akin to a Manhattan
[39:30] project for AI which would include a
[39:33] significant expansion in US electricity
[39:36] capacity by the last decade. Now again
[39:38] the late in the decade but again this is
[39:40] assuming when we get to AGI or at least
[39:43] get to GPT5.
[39:46] The main point is the same way that
[39:48] deepseek was an accelerant moment, think
[39:50] about what happened to the inference
[39:52] needs. That was in January. Those charts
[39:56] you saw are from January to April. This
[39:59] doesn't include V3 and the video side
[40:02] which I said is already melting GPUs.
[40:05] The demand side is growing faster than
[40:08] the supply side in a exponential way
[40:10] because the models are being released
[40:13] allowing people to use them there. I use
[40:15] them more than I ever have and I've
[40:17] mentioned that on these videos. So, um,
[40:20] he warned that without massive new
[40:21] infrastructure projects, we could hit
[40:23] hard limits on scaling. Uh, and this is
[40:26] why if you're ever wondering, yeah, the
[40:28] massive power scaling challenge, there's
[40:30] no way that we're not going to continue
[40:33] this buildout. So, if you're thinking
[40:35] that they won't spend the money, that
[40:37] we're going to reach some point, you're
[40:39] reading people that are just feeding you
[40:41] garbage at this point. Read the
[40:43] companies and read what's happening.
[40:44] This is a race that has to happen. So
[40:46] what does Mark Andre say? Reasoning. AI
[40:49] isn't the next cloud or the internet.
[40:50] It's the next microprocessor. I think
[40:52] this is a new kind of computer. All
[40:54] incumbents are going to get nuked.
[40:56] Everything gets rebuilt. This isn't an
[40:58] upgrade. This is a reset. So think
[41:01] depression, but not economically. That's
[41:04] a reset is a depression. It is everyone
[41:07] gets washed out and then we go through.
[41:09] So, when he says the incumbents are all
[41:11] going to get nuked, let's start with one
[41:13] that so far is in that case. Shares of
[41:15] Apple sliding after this year's WWC
[41:18] event, I mean, I don't know how they're
[41:21] going to catch up. If someone else had a
[41:22] phone right now, they'd be dead already.
[41:24] Um, because they have no AI business.
[41:27] It's just staggering what's happening.
[41:29] But, uh, the fact that they're behind
[41:31] and you can't use Siri is just it's
[41:33] unbelievable. Back into the job
[41:35] situation. Google's offering buyouts to
[41:37] US employees throughout the company.
[41:40] Here are the another look at the numbers
[41:42] longer term number of employees. And I
[41:44] want you to see two things. If you add
[41:46] up all of these, basically
[41:50] you're growing across the board always
[41:53] except since 2022. That was when we got
[41:57] the rate situation, but that's also when
[41:59] Chat GPT came out. And now there's no
[42:01] more hiring going on. So, they're
[42:04] growing earnings rapidly, way above 20%
[42:07] and they're not hiring. Super
[42:10] interesting. Anecdotally, most VCs are
[42:11] seeing companies grow faster with fewer
[42:13] employees over the last two years, but
[42:14] this is the first concrete data I've
[42:16] seen. This is from Patrick Collison. Um,
[42:19] I've talked about this. I talked about
[42:22] the Stripe session and gave it as like
[42:24] one of the most important macro pieces
[42:25] to look at in terms of their
[42:27] presentation. The reason is you've got
[42:30] new businesses growing that are
[42:32] eventually going to compete with the
[42:33] behemoths.
[42:35] No employees are being hired by those
[42:37] people. On the other end, so think of it
[42:39] as a barbell. The other side of the
[42:41] distribution, the mega caps are not
[42:42] hiring anyone anymore. Uh Disney's
[42:45] looking to take it down. They're all
[42:46] focused on revenue per employee. And
[42:48] what you have is the rest of the economy
[42:50] where people are stuck in jobs where the
[42:53] companies are eventually going to go out
[42:54] of business. And so this process is not
[42:56] happening simultaneously, which is a
[42:58] recession. It's a recycling that's
[43:00] happening and people can go out and get
[43:02] a job because of the the flexible labor
[43:04] side, but it'll be for less money. And
[43:06] that's what you're going to see is the
[43:07] wage pressure to me is just going to
[43:09] continue. Um Microsoft working on a deal
[43:12] to add 1 million. This is again just to
[43:13] show the growth that we're about to see.
[43:15] The co-pilot side gets into the agent
[43:17] side. You're now reaching a point where
[43:19] more and more companies are going to do
[43:20] this. So how do you protect yourself and
[43:22] your kids? I wrote this paper,
[43:23] brainstorming with the future, uh,
[43:25] Substack. Go read it. I'm not going to
[43:27] go through the details of it. Bill
[43:28] Gurley, uh, another good, um, thing to
[43:32] listen to. This was on the state of VC
[43:35] and the entire private market. It's
[43:37] important as I make the segue now into
[43:39] the final part of crypto. It was on
[43:41] invest like the best. Uh, definitely
[43:43] worth listening to. The highlights from
[43:45] Bill Zombie Unicorn Overhang. There were
[43:47] about a thousand companies that raised
[43:49] between 200 and 300 million during the
[43:51] zero in interest rate policy, but now
[43:53] lack the growth and can't justify their
[43:55] valuations. Again, they took in a ton of
[43:57] money. They got up to a billion dollars.
[43:59] They haven't taken the marks down yet.
[44:01] They're still sitting at high
[44:02] valuations. He goes through this. He
[44:03] goes through a litany of why the private
[44:06] markets are in trouble. I'm not going to
[44:07] go through all of them. The second thing
[44:09] was the postm shock to AI. All of this
[44:12] stuff has created an overhang. And this
[44:14] is why the the IPO market at least for
[44:17] these companies is very difficult. The
[44:19] valuations are hard and it's also why
[44:21] you've seen this Harvard this is from
[44:24] their local paper plans 1 billion sale
[44:26] private equity stakes. This is back in
[44:28] April. Um they're all out there trying
[44:30] to do this. Yale consider selling part
[44:32] of its $6 billion uh or the transaction
[44:35] could approach $6 billion u near to sell
[44:39] $2.5 billion private equity stakes.
[44:41] Again, they're taking out debt. So, as
[44:44] I've said, AI is messing with the
[44:46] education system. The administration is
[44:48] messing with the education system.
[44:50] Private equity and their investments
[44:52] where between 35 and 60% of their
[44:55] investments, according to things I've
[44:56] shown on here, are in the private
[44:58] market. The entire private market, in my
[45:01] opinion, because of less liquidity, is
[45:04] just it's going to be in trouble in the
[45:06] environment that I see. Uh you won't
[45:08] hear the private equity people say it.
[45:09] I've seen them speak out, but the
[45:11] reality is the pressure is growing. The
[45:13] pressure is growing. You need to produce
[45:15] way outsized returns and eventually
[45:17] Bitcoin will be the measurement. Daily
[45:19] liquidity 24 hours a day producing well
[45:22] over returns that private equity funds
[45:24] can produce, well over with VC funds.
[45:27] Uh, and as we saw with Circle and as
[45:28] we've seen with any of Core Weeave and
[45:31] things that have come out, I think this
[45:32] is going to be more and more around the
[45:33] AI and crypto world and people realizing
[45:36] they just don't know how to invest it
[45:37] and all these long-term duration
[45:39] investments are getting hurt by what AI
[45:42] is doing to everything. It's causing
[45:44] fiscal dominance. It's causing rates to
[45:46] be higher. It's causing the need to run
[45:48] growth at a level, bring short rates
[45:50] down, but long rates are going to stay
[45:51] higher. It just creates an a very, very
[45:54] difficult environment. And I think Bill
[45:56] go Bill Gurley highly respected but more
[45:58] importantly he's a systems thinker Santa
[46:01] Fe Institute person. Go listen to him on
[46:03] anything but in particular he gave 10
[46:06] reasons why this is going to be a
[46:07] problem. That is a systems thinker going
[46:09] from a top- down basis of the problem.
[46:11] Uh this is just highlighting the returns
[46:13] and how the public markets have already
[46:14] been outperforming. This is going to get
[46:16] more of a problem. uh something Julian
[46:18] Patel and rap Raul Pal have highlighted
[46:22] many many times but I just want to make
[46:24] sure you guys see this. So this is
[46:26] showing the the problem we're running
[46:27] into in terms of demographics. So you've
[46:30] heard if you've read Elon Musk the
[46:32] biggest crisis in the world is that the
[46:34] world's not have in the developed
[46:35] world's not having any more babies. So
[46:37] this line here is the demographic
[46:39] problem that's happening and this is
[46:41] leading to this labor participation rate
[46:44] which continues to move lower. We've got
[46:47] aging demographics, falling birth rates,
[46:49] and now the rise of automation. So, the
[46:51] rise of AI, I'll continue to say these
[46:53] two things are what forced the
[46:55] government. Right now, at this point,
[46:57] demographics has us with a fiscal
[46:59] deficit that is unfixable between Social
[47:01] Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Humans
[47:03] are already being replaced by AM
[47:04] robotics at staggering pace, and the
[47:06] shift is only beginning. This is
[47:08] deflationary. It also reinforces the
[47:10] need for ongoing stimulus to keep the
[47:12] system afloat.
[47:14] Everyone talks about the problem of the
[47:16] math. They don't talk about the reason
[47:17] and the fact that there's no way to fix
[47:19] it. AI will eventually fix it, but we're
[47:22] ways away from that. In the meantime,
[47:24] Bitcoin goes higher and all of the
[47:26] crypto world continues to accelerate in
[47:28] terms of what's happening. So, I wanted
[47:30] to highlight this this level here, debt
[47:33] to GDP. So, this is two things. This is
[47:35] debt to GDP. The S&P 500. This is why we
[47:37] don't have recessions anymore, people. I
[47:38] can't make it any more obvious than
[47:40] this. There are no more recessions
[47:42] because we don't have this fiat system
[47:44] of debt in the equity market. it's been
[47:45] replaced by the government. So the
[47:48] government interceded and what happened
[47:50] at 2009, this is when the Bitcoin white
[47:52] paper came out. So now we've got this
[47:54] gap completely reversed where it's now
[47:57] public sector debt over private sector
[47:59] debt. If I brought in households, you'd
[48:01] see the same exact thing. This is the
[48:04] situation here. The government has the
[48:06] debt. They have a printing press. They
[48:09] print money. And this problem here in
[48:11] terms of S&P 500 is down here because of
[48:14] the mag 7 which don't have any people.
[48:16] They're not hiring anyone. So the
[48:18] companies that are winning are not
[48:19] hiring one. The startup businesses that
[48:21] are competing are not hiring anyone. And
[48:23] we're about to have companies worth a
[48:24] billion dollars with no employees. So
[48:27] this is accelerated to a point where if
[48:29] you don't focus on AI and you don't
[48:30] believe it, you don't understand it, you
[48:31] don't use it, you have no chance of
[48:33] trading macro in this environment. Uh
[48:35] Paul Tudtor Jones says the road map is
[48:36] clear. inflation will be allowed to run
[48:38] hot with three and a half% inflation as
[48:39] the US tries to grow its way out of the
[48:41] debt. Bitcoin will be the fastest horse
[48:43] in the race. He said that uh 5 years
[48:45] ago. Um so here's the Bitcoin chart. We
[48:48] went up to the highs. We're
[48:49] consolidating here. Um every time that
[48:52] something in Iran happens, everyone
[48:54] points to look, gold's going higher, but
[48:57] Bitcoin's going down. So everyone hears
[48:59] this. The only buyers of Bitcoin are
[49:02] either corporates that are buying
[49:05] underneath. They're, think of it as
[49:07] Bitcoin buybacks. Uh they're not chasing
[49:10] the market higher. That's made for hedge
[49:12] funds. Uh hedge funds jump into gold
[49:14] when there's a political event. And they
[49:15] short stocks. So of course, Bitcoin is
[49:17] going to go down because it's being
[49:19] driven by the knee-jerk reaction of
[49:21] people who think of Bitcoin as going to
[49:23] zero all the time. The people who
[49:25] believe it's going up, they don't chase
[49:27] the thing higher. It's not that's not
[49:29] the way it trades. Um, this is what's
[49:31] keeping Bitcoin from going up uh a ton.
[49:34] So, the change year to date up 13% for
[49:36] Bitcoin. Look at all of these numbers
[49:38] here. Forget Tether, that's a uh stable
[49:41] coin. Let's leave Ripple alone at this
[49:43] point. Down six, down 22. Look, Salana,
[49:47] Ethereum, both down 22. You can go
[49:49] through this stuff. We are in a bare
[49:51] market. SWE down uh 26%.
[49:56] Avalanche down 44. These are the types.
[49:59] Tron down 45. These are what you would
[50:02] expect to be going higher in a bull
[50:04] market, but we're not in a bull market
[50:06] for the utility tokens at this point.
[50:08] And I just want to say this and
[50:09] highlight this. This was the NASDAQ
[50:11] bubble to me. This is what happened with
[50:13] FTX. FTX and the overhang
[50:16] happened here. So this was 2021 in my
[50:19] opinion. 2022 the regulations came in,
[50:22] the Democrats kill it goes down. This is
[50:24] the NASDAQ posted.com bubble in 2000.
[50:28] Every time you get a rally,
[50:30] then you get this. I think we're in
[50:32] here. And now I think we're kind of in
[50:34] here. And the reason I say we're in here
[50:36] is because this came out of the
[50:38] financial crisis. This to me is the
[50:42] tariff and the deepseek moment. People
[50:44] do not understand what AI is going to do
[50:46] to the economy. They do not understand
[50:47] what AI is going to do to jobs. This
[50:49] situation is going to get worse. And
[50:51] we're at the network effect moment for
[50:53] Bitcoin and for the tokens. So Paul
[50:57] Tudtor Jones made one mistake. I love
[50:59] Paul. He knows that. I I known him a
[51:01] long time. But he said Bitcoin has five
[51:05] times the V of gold. I just want to
[51:09] start highlighting to people this is a
[51:10] oneyear well yeah this is 365 day V or
[51:14] 360 V. This is 360 V. Gold's at 17.
[51:18] Bitcoin has declined now to 41. If you I
[51:22] did shorter term, you're doing about two
[51:24] times the V now. Bitcoin V has come
[51:26] down. This has gone down. I have said
[51:28] before and I believe it there will be a
[51:29] massive short squeeze in Bitcoin coming
[51:31] up at some point this year. Uh I think
[51:33] it'll happen either over the summertime
[51:35] or sometime in in Q3 is my guess, but
[51:38] I'm not going to try to pinpoint it. I
[51:39] just think there's a short squeeze
[51:41] coming. Gold's V is now in that 17 area.
[51:45] five times. It would obviously take us
[51:47] up more into where it was before. Paul
[51:49] needs to adjust his V adjusted target.
[51:51] It's I think he needs to have more
[51:52] Bitcoin than he's talking about. A
[51:54] little less gold, little more Bitcoin.
[51:56] V's been coming in. Um I want to go back
[52:00] to Patrick Collison. Uh, Stripe's macro
[52:04] figures, payment volume from customers
[52:06] that signed up for strip is tracking way
[52:08] ahead of prior years when the lockdowns
[52:10] triggered a high surge in last week was
[52:13] 116%
[52:14] ahead. Now remember this as we keep
[52:17] going through this because the reason of
[52:19] this is going to get into crypto. Stripe
[52:22] is playing 4D chess circumventing the
[52:24] banking system via crypto rails. Stable
[52:27] coin payments are growing rapidly. So
[52:29] again, you want to invest in things that
[52:31] are growing exponentially. I've already
[52:33] shown you the fact that we're going to
[52:34] have that for power. We're going to have
[52:36] that for semis because we have it for
[52:37] tokens. So you want that for AI. Oracle
[52:40] highlighted. So here's the other thing.
[52:42] Stable coins. If you haven't done your
[52:44] homework yet on stable coins and you
[52:46] don't understand why Bitcoin benefits
[52:48] from stable coins, call up 22V or watch
[52:50] me on on Pomp and I go through it every
[52:53] single week. Stable coins now present
[52:54] what I believe is the first credible
[52:56] opportunity to onboard a billion people
[52:58] into crypto. This is the network
[53:00] effects. If you haven't checked in the
[53:03] latest stablecoin data recently, you
[53:04] might be surprised. Stable coins have
[53:05] done 33 trillion in transaction volume
[53:08] in the last 12 months, consistently
[53:10] hitting new all-time highs. That's close
[53:12] to 20 times the volume of PayPal, close
[53:14] to three times the volume of Visa, and
[53:16] approaching the volume
[53:18] of the entire AC.
[53:21] This is what's happening. This is what's
[53:23] going on. You want to invest in growth.
[53:25] Stable coin transaction volumes hit 752
[53:28] billion in May, up from 409 a year ago.
[53:33] So again, token growth, stable coin
[53:35] volume growth. It's happening across
[53:38] Latin America, Africa, Asia, Pacific,
[53:41] Europe, Western Europe, North America.
[53:43] This is not just a US thing. This is not
[53:45] just one. This is everything. Stable
[53:48] coin supply is at an all-time high.
[53:49] Another great set. Over 1% of the total
[53:52] US dollar supply is now tokenized as
[53:54] stable coins. Now on the infrastructure
[53:56] side, I want to get back to what I put.
[53:59] Ethereum, Tron, this down 22% so far
[54:03] year to date. This down 45%. They
[54:06] continue to dominate
[54:08] growth on chains like Salana, Arbitron
[54:10] B. At some point here, this will have an
[54:12] effect. you will start to see the
[54:14] benefits go through because unlike
[54:16] the.com bubble which took a long time
[54:18] crypto a goes faster but you're looking
[54:20] for major inflection points and this
[54:23] Wall Street Journal article on Friday
[54:25] was it Walmart and Amazon basically the
[54:28] entire US economy so if consumption is
[54:31] 70% Walmart and Amazon are the bulk of
[54:35] consumption on staples and on regular
[54:38] things exploring issuing their own
[54:41] stable coins corporate coins could take
[54:42] payment activity away from the banks and
[54:45] the trady system accelerating the
[54:50] volumes and accelerating the dollars
[54:52] that move into the digital economy,
[54:54] accelerating wallets being set up. And
[54:56] for the first time, Visa and Mastercard
[54:59] stocks actually fall after a stable coin
[55:01] report. And not fall a little, it was
[55:04] the largest fall for these companies in
[55:06] I think for Visa, I think it was the
[55:08] largest daily fall since 2021. but more
[55:10] importantly on a stable coin report. So
[55:13] this is no longer a joke. Everyone's
[55:15] been waiting for when stable coins would
[55:17] have an impact. It's not just Walmart
[55:19] and Amazon. Shopify will enable stable
[55:21] coins in checkout via Shopify payments.
[55:26] Circle stock went gang busters. There's
[55:28] more IPOs coming out. Shares soared 25%
[55:31] on Friday even though the broader market
[55:33] plunged on the military conflict between
[55:35] Israel and Iran.
[55:37] So, Bitcoin may have traded lower, but
[55:40] the stable coin company that came out
[55:43] last week did not. Uh, Sockje will
[55:45] launch a dollarback stable coin. Yes, a
[55:47] dollarback stable coin. Uh, first major
[55:50] European lender to launch a dollarback
[55:53] cryptocurrency in the booming market for
[55:54] stable coins. Genius stablecoin bill
[55:57] passes key vote advances in the US
[55:58] Senate. David Sax says stable coin bill
[56:01] will be a historic bipartisan win. He
[56:03] believes the Genius Act, the new state
[56:04] calling legislate, could become the
[56:06] first major bipartisan bill, the first
[56:09] major bipartisan bill to pass in years,
[56:12] marking a turning point for the US
[56:13] crypto regulation.
[56:15] I don't think it could be more important
[56:17] than that. Blockchain initiatives, so
[56:19] the blockchain, a completely separate
[56:20] side, but it'll start to get into
[56:22] tokenization and other things outside of
[56:24] it, uh, have been adopted by 60% of
[56:27] Fortune 500 companies at this point.
[56:31] I believe Robin Hood will launch
[56:33] tokenized stocks in 20 days. That means
[56:36] you'll be able to trade stocks round the
[56:38] clock. Uh the announcement could shake
[56:40] the financial world and fuel its global
[56:41] expansion. If you haven't looked at
[56:43] Robin Hood stock, you missed last week's
[56:45] time and the last slide for this week.
[56:47] Uh I think Bitcoiners will be extremely
[56:49] pleased
[56:51] Trump will soon announce plans to
[56:53] accumulate more Bitcoin. Uh I'm going to
[56:55] leave it there. Have a good weekend.
[56:58] I'll see you guys next
