--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] holiday weekend.
[00:02] Uh but got to squeeze one out before uh
[00:05] we all go uh celebrate. So bond market
[00:10] took over this week as the new uh fear
[00:14] factor. So I'll go through the warning
[00:16] signals that are coming out of it. I'll
[00:18] explain to everyone about why you're all
[00:21] of a sudden hearing about Liz Truss and
[00:24] why this is the Liz Truss moment for the
[00:26] US. uh and whether that means or when it
[00:31] means the government will start
[00:32] liquidity injections. Uh capital
[00:35] controls, this is the first time I've
[00:37] talked about capital controls, not in an
[00:38] emerging market, but we'll talk about
[00:40] that today. Uh tariffs came back, bad
[00:43] week for private equity and endowments
[00:45] and particularly Harvard. Uh but I think
[00:48] there's a bigger story here uh in this
[00:50] long duration asset problem and ill
[00:53] liquidity problem. uh AI continues its
[00:57] ascent and we have Nvidia this week
[00:59] which will be important and then the
[01:02] investment winner has now been
[01:04] determined as we made new all-time highs
[01:06] in Bitcoin. So let's go through this uh
[01:09] one by one. All right, just to start I
[01:11] want to go back to the end of the year.
[01:13] U America's debt cannot keep stacking
[01:16] up. Jeff Gunlac was interviewed in the
[01:19] economist and basically in the coming
[01:21] years expect dollar debasement, debt
[01:24] restructuring or both. And we're getting
[01:27] closer to both. In my opinion, we're
[01:29] definitely seeing the the dollar
[01:31] debasement story. America's government
[01:33] is on its way to bankruptcy. So, this
[01:35] sounds like a dramatic thing. Uh and it
[01:38] is to some degree. Uh but I just want to
[01:41] go through where we are and how this
[01:43] will be you know the major fear factor
[01:46] as I say if not now going forward there
[01:49] could be a pause uh it will be in the
[01:51] second half of the year and going
[01:53] forward until the government can find a
[01:55] way to keep long-term yields from going
[01:57] higher. Uh Trump's next hurdle the bond
[02:00] market hates the tax bill. So again we
[02:03] came into this year believing there'd be
[02:06] austerity. The bond market warns Trump
[02:08] and Congress of not controlling the
[02:11] deficit. So remember at the beginning of
[02:13] the year, Trump and Bessant's entire
[02:15] tariffs and austerity plan works if only
[02:18] if they end up reducing the deficit.
[02:20] This is from March 13th. If you're going
[02:22] to cause short-term pain, then you need
[02:24] to be willing to stick through it and
[02:25] deliver the goals you set long term.
[02:27] This is Paul Vulkar.
[02:30] Trump has to not only stand the public
[02:31] backlash, collapsing approval ratings in
[02:33] falling markets, but he actually has to
[02:35] deliver on cutting the deficit. That is
[02:37] out the window. We got the Moody's
[02:39] downgrade last week. And here's where
[02:42] we've now gone with Bessant uh yesterday
[02:44] and this is what he posted. We can both
[02:46] grow the economy and control the debt.
[02:48] What is important is that the economy
[02:51] grows faster than the debt. So, we went
[02:52] from austerity, which would slow uh
[02:55] things to cut spending, and now we're
[02:58] jumping right into, well, let's grow our
[03:00] way out. Uh, which is the argument
[03:02] pretty much everyone has tried. And so,
[03:04] we're kicking the can down the road. Uh,
[03:07] and that has huge implications for very
[03:09] long-term yields. So, 30-year yields,
[03:11] the US got all the attention this week,
[03:13] but I just want to highlight, um, this
[03:15] is the one-year range. The blue dots are
[03:18] where we are now. So, it's not just a US
[03:20] problem. Every single bond market around
[03:22] the world uh the UK, Japan, Australia,
[03:26] New Zealand, all of them except for
[03:28] South Korea and China are basically in
[03:31] the same boat. Yields are going higher
[03:33] because this is not a localized problem
[03:35] in the US. This is a global problem. So,
[03:36] that's the first thing to take note of.
[03:38] Here's the chart of 30-year yields. We
[03:39] got up close to what would be the
[03:41] highest level since the great financial
[03:43] crisis. So, when that happens, you'll
[03:46] it'll take it back to 2007. there'll be
[03:48] a headline saying, "Look what happened
[03:50] the last time we had rates at these
[03:51] levels." Uh, here are JGBs. You
[03:55] basically now we're back to the highest
[03:57] level um in over 25
[04:00] years. Guilts. Um, this is the Liz Trust
[04:04] moment. So, these are 30-year yields in
[04:06] the UK.
[04:08] And this Liz trust moment just so you
[04:10] guys have a little history. This
[04:12] occurred in basically the end of
[04:14] September into October, early October in
[04:17] 2022. Uh total fears uh you had had the
[04:21] rise had basically gone from less than
[04:23] 1% at the
[04:25] beginning all the way up to
[04:27] five and this became a you know a global
[04:30] impact problem. So in the US here are
[04:33] the podcasts this week. Trump's Liz
[04:35] trust moment could be cataclysmic.
[04:36] America's risking Liz trust moment. This
[04:39] is a good podcast by the way. Kevin Mir
[04:41] very impressed. US bond seen at risk of
[04:43] Liz trust moment as defoons. Is this
[04:46] America's? So this is what everyone
[04:48] talked about. We went from tariffs um
[04:51] and austerity and we're going to have a
[04:53] recession. Now we're going to have a
[04:56] problem that we're going to have debt.
[04:58] Again guys,
[04:59] um this is just what everyone does in
[05:02] the market is they extrapolate a current
[05:04] level because that's all this is. Rates
[05:06] have not changed that much. But now that
[05:08] we're 50 basis points higher than we
[05:10] were say 3 months ago, everyone has to
[05:13] say that the world's going to end. When
[05:14] we could go down 50 basis point 3 months
[05:16] from now, we'll be exactly the same
[05:18] level and then you won't hear about it
[05:19] anymore. Um these are the reasons why
[05:21] everyone's worried. So long dated
[05:23] treasuries have yet to fully recover
[05:24] from their April dislocation. Concerning
[05:26] debt levels, an outlook for greater
[05:27] issuance. Remote odds for serious
[05:29] efforts to tackle the fiscal position.
[05:31] Debt sealing talks later this year going
[05:33] to be an issue. Political pressure on
[05:35] the Fed. Shaky demand from Asian buyers.
[05:37] These are all the reasons why there's
[05:40] pressure. So, of course, um, and this is
[05:43] from Mike Canterowitz, uh, who I like.
[05:47] Uh, so he put something out. How higher
[05:50] rates could impact stocks. Uh, two
[05:53] things about the chart. one, we we're
[05:55] you can see how tenure yields we're
[05:56] basically in the exact same range we've
[05:58] been now for the last two years. Um we
[06:00] go down, we go back up. Uh now people
[06:04] are going to start going through bond
[06:06] market risk as pressure on equity
[06:07] builds. It always comes back to equities
[06:10] going down. That's where everything
[06:11] always ends up. But at the same time, no
[06:14] one talks about the fact that profit
[06:15] margins just continue to go higher from
[06:17] AI. And do you really think when
[06:20] Palunteer, a $300 billion company, is
[06:23] already trading at a 520 PE that that
[06:26] stock's going to be impacted by bond
[06:28] yields going 30-year yields going from
[06:30] 475 to 5 and a quarter? Uh it's crazy
[06:33] talk. There's there's no zero impact
[06:37] whatsoever to the stocks in the long
[06:39] term from rates going up 50 basis
[06:41] points. Will somebody turn around and
[06:44] go, "Yeah, I'd like to buy bonds." If
[06:46] you believe the government is continuing
[06:47] to focus on growth and you believe that
[06:50] 10-year rates are already mispriced
[06:52] because they are below nominal GDP,
[06:54] which I'll show again, do not focus on
[06:57] bonds being a a buy. Um, who is going to
[07:00] buy them with inflation and nominal GDP,
[07:03] both up near 4%. Doesn't make any sense
[07:05] to me why you wouldn't own equities
[07:07] instead of bonds unless profit margins
[07:10] were coming down. And as I showed,
[07:11] profit margins are not only at all-time
[07:13] highs. We are just entering AI. So
[07:16] again, I'm going to keep saying it. Go
[07:18] spend some time on artificial
[07:19] intelligence and start realizing what's
[07:21] coming in front of you. Massive
[07:23] productivity gains are coming for
[07:24] corporations. Uh not in the technology
[07:27] side. That's what has profit margins
[07:28] that level. It'll be spreading to other
[07:30] companies. I'll be doing a lot more work
[07:32] on that in the going in the future. But
[07:33] here's the other thing. Rates are moving
[07:35] higher. Just so you see the facts since
[07:37] I hear that this is going to kill the
[07:38] housing market. Household debt. Here it
[07:41] is. Leverage is a percentage of
[07:44] GDP. Okay. I I just want to make sure
[07:47] that you look at these recession bars.
[07:50] Traditional recessions. I say they don't
[07:52] exist anymore. Look what happens.
[07:53] Leverage goes into this for both the
[07:55] blue line and the gray line. Then we get
[07:58] a recession. Then we get a recession.
[08:00] That's what a fiat system does. But when
[08:02] the government takes all the debt, guys,
[08:05] now you have the government. That's why
[08:07] we're we're looking at government debt.
[08:09] Yields are moving higher. I agree. But
[08:11] they have a printing press and they come
[08:13] in. So whenever it becomes a risk, it
[08:15] actually is a good thing, not a bad
[08:16] thing. Here's what's happened to
[08:17] household debt as a percentage of GDP.
[08:19] Here's what's happened to non-financial
[08:20] debt as a percentage of GDP. It has not
[08:23] gone up, guys. So please don't worry
[08:25] about credit card delinquencies and all
[08:27] these things that every macro person
[08:29] just continues to put out there. Are
[08:31] there delinquencies? Yes. Are there
[08:32] people at at certain parts of the
[08:34] economies that are borrowing too much?
[08:36] Yes. But when you look in an economy,
[08:38] you can't pick the pieces that you want
[08:40] to look at and just look at the bottom
[08:42] end. Overall delinquencies are not an
[08:45] issue. Overall mortgage is not an issue.
[08:47] The housing market, we still have an
[08:49] under supply of housing. So yes, certain
[08:52] parts of the country are going to go
[08:53] through this. every single thing that
[08:54] you can read. Just remember commercial
[08:56] real estate. Remember SOM rule. Remember
[08:59] every recession fear that ever pops up.
[09:02] And just remember this is not going to
[09:04] be it because the government has a
[09:05] printing press. Here's the Liz Trust
[09:07] moment. Now on the equity market just to
[09:09] make sure we get it. Here it is right
[09:10] here. This is the footsie. This is the
[09:12] UK stock market. The lows were made for
[09:15] the last two years at the Liz Trust
[09:18] moment. Remember that when you get a
[09:20] situation where the government is under
[09:22] pressure, they print money. 10-year
[09:24] yields not as big an issue. We're not on
[09:26] the outside. So, so far it's just 30
[09:28] yields. The less liquid you are and I'll
[09:31] start getting into longduration assets
[09:32] and the problems for private equity,
[09:34] venture capital, real estate, all of
[09:36] them will have trouble in a world where
[09:38] we have no certainty on the future
[09:40] because of the deficits. be very very
[09:42] careful with illlquid long duration
[09:45] assets and long duration assets that are
[09:47] liquid will be under pressure too
[09:49] meaning the mag seven uh some things
[09:52] that you can go listen this is a very
[09:54] very very good balance podcast this week
[09:56] if you want to go read about the debt
[09:58] spiral and avoid the the drama and the
[10:01] the world's going to end calls go I'm
[10:03] here to give you guys things to listen
[10:05] to that are balanced where they
[10:07] highlight the reality which is hey
[10:10] remember this on April 9th We found the
[10:12] Trump put, the best and put, a 5% yield
[10:14] on 30-year treasuries. All I heard all
[10:16] year was that there wasn't a put on the
[10:17] equity market. It was on the bond
[10:18] market. I kept saying if the equity
[10:20] market falls down, we're going to have
[10:22] an issue. We'll have a recession and
[10:23] yields are going to actually have to go
[10:24] up. We had yields up, stocks bottom.
[10:27] Well, now we're having yields up again.
[10:29] Shouldn't this be a buy signal again?
[10:31] Shouldn't this be the time where Oh,
[10:32] that's right. Best sees easing capital
[10:34] rule on treasuries this summer. So, he
[10:36] talks about this publicly on Friday.
[10:38] They're prepping you for what needs to
[10:40] go on. The Fed early signs of pressure
[10:43] in money markets. Remember QT is down to
[10:46] 5
[10:47] billion. We're already at the point
[10:49] where the repo facility is empty. You're
[10:52] getting closer. China conducting a 500
[10:54] billion
[10:55] yuan. Printing press, guys. Printing
[10:57] press. So, let's go now into where the
[11:00] true risk is
[11:02] because Donald Trump is not done yet
[11:05] trying to figure out how to restructure
[11:07] global trade. And there's one part as I
[11:08] highlighted last week that has not been
[11:11] dealt with yet. Uh and that's the debt.
[11:14] That is the foreign ownership of our
[11:17] assets. So in this Luke Ramen was
[11:20] interviewed on this another good one to
[11:22] listen to. I'll show you the the actual
[11:24] thing in there, but what he talked about
[11:25] the reason global US capital flows are
[11:27] coming. I talked about capital
[11:30] uh flows are equivalent to trade. So so
[11:33] far we've only been focused on trade. If
[11:35] trade doesn't work, then we move to the
[11:37] next part, which is capital controls.
[11:39] The problem we have is too much
[11:40] investment in the US, which is why we
[11:42] want our currency to weaken, even though
[11:44] publicly we won't say it. And the rest
[11:46] of the world doesn't want to own our
[11:47] currency anymore, and it's becoming an
[11:49] issue. Bitcoin and gold will profit from
[11:52] them. Yes. Why the Treasury has not sold
[11:53] a 10-year in 10 years. Listen, why the
[11:55] US Treasury has not net sold, they left
[11:58] a net out a 10-year in 10 years. Oh, on
[12:01] debt despite QT, you have to go listen
[12:04] to this. We're not even actually selling
[12:06] them because we're buying them. Why will
[12:08] we increasingly see crash ups in
[12:11] financial markets? What happens with the
[12:13] US Treasury 10-year at 5%, which is
[12:16] where we're headed to. So again,
[12:18] remember when this stuff starts coming
[12:20] up, there are things to talk about, but
[12:22] it's capital control. So this is the
[12:24] podcast uh less noise news, more signal.
[12:27] Hadn't heard uh of this podcast before
[12:29] this week. I listened to two episodes
[12:32] this week. Uh, both were good. I'm going
[12:33] to show you the other one there. I don't
[12:35] know who at America ending up with
[12:36] capital controls on their bingo card.
[12:38] Uh, the one big beautiful act includes a
[12:40] proposed remittance tax that has been
[12:42] adjusted to a 3 and a half% excise tax
[12:44] on international money transfers made by
[12:46] non- US citizens. We are getting to the
[12:48] point where taxing people taking money
[12:51] back or taxing people for having their
[12:53] money here. Not on the currency, but on
[12:56] the asset side, whatever the case is.
[12:58] This is not something new. This was
[13:00] talked about. You can go read about it.
[13:01] So I'm going to highlight the places
[13:02] where this was brought up. Forget
[13:03] tariffs. Capital controls are game
[13:05] changer. A risk. This is October 20 or
[13:08] November 22nd of 24 last year. Implement
[13:11] a market access charge. Again, a
[13:13] suggestion on what to do. This is coming
[13:16] from
[13:17] senators. This is the other one from
[13:19] less noise more signal. Very balanced.
[13:22] Mel Madison. Never heard of him until
[13:24] two months ago. I've listened to three
[13:26] podcasts by him. Again, he talks about
[13:30] the problem we're having. We have a
[13:32] problem. Same thing Jeff Dun Gunlack
[13:34] talked about. Same thing you read in the
[13:36] papers every day. But what this means is
[13:39] actually that the government has to come
[13:41] in and that's what the debasement is.
[13:43] And that's why this is more for Bitcoin
[13:45] and gold. I showed this chart. I'm going
[13:47] to keep showing it as time goes on. This
[13:50] is the long duration asset problem. The
[13:51] orange line here is tenure rates. The
[13:54] white line here is nominal GDP total
[13:57] revenues of the country year-over-year
[13:59] growth. We are still right now at
[14:01] 4.7% while 10ear yields are below it.
[14:04] This point, this line here is when the
[14:06] Thai bot broke. It's when Asians started
[14:08] to put money to work. I showed this a
[14:10] few weeks ago. Asian repatriation is
[14:13] happening. And especially when you see
[14:15] JGB yields breaking higher, money is
[14:18] going to be moving back to places
[14:20] outside of the US partly because of the
[14:22] trade war and what Trump doesn't want
[14:24] with the global reserve. Part is the
[14:26] risk of of of uh restructuring. It
[14:29] doesn't really matter. All of those
[14:31] things that I've shown you, what Jeff
[14:32] Dunlock talked about, we are going to
[14:34] see these converge and then we're going
[14:36] to go above. right now fair value on
[14:38] 10-year yields purely based on nominal
[14:40] GDP in the time before the re uh Asian
[14:44] uh dollars or Asian u Asians started
[14:48] manufacturing in a big way and recycling
[14:50] those dollars into bonds. We're going to
[14:52] get up
[14:54] to 100 to 150 basis points over nominal
[14:57] GDP unless the government comes in and
[15:00] doesn't allow it to happen. More more
[15:02] likely it happens slowly. the dollar
[15:05] which does not get talked about again
[15:07] when Trump initially put in the tariff
[15:09] fears there was a belief that the dollar
[15:11] would go higher that's what this spike
[15:12] is here believe it or not this is when
[15:14] he said the Mexico and Canada side since
[15:17] that point this is what the dollar is
[15:19] doing I'm seeing many people try to pick
[15:21] the bottom of this I don't see the
[15:23] reason why you're picking trying to pick
[15:24] the bottom of the dollar even if it's a
[15:27] bounce we just had a bounce it's a
[15:28] deadcat bounce and this is the reason
[15:30] why when people talk about the dollar
[15:33] this is The Asian dollar, it is just
[15:36] coming off all-time lows. This is the
[15:38] beginning of something. So when people
[15:40] look at the dollar, they're looking at
[15:41] the euro side. The Asia side has broken
[15:44] away from treasuries. This is the
[15:46] overlay with TLTs over the last four
[15:48] years. I showed this last week. The most
[15:51] important chart that I can think of, the
[15:53] dollar is weakening against the Asian
[15:55] currencies at the same time that
[15:57] treasuries are going down. This is the
[15:58] linkage that was the most important in
[16:00] the world for assets, for VC, for
[16:03] private equity, for everything out
[16:05] there. Anyone who is a long duration
[16:07] person in the asset side is dealing with
[16:10] the reality that rates have been too low
[16:13] and the government can't fix them. They
[16:16] can find ways to make sure that Main
[16:18] Street doesn't get hurt as much by it.
[16:19] I'm not going to bring that up here, but
[16:20] just watch Fanny and Freddy and what's
[16:22] going on with them right now. we're
[16:24] going to have a different world going
[16:25] forward and longer duration asset um
[16:28] owners uh savers uh are going to be
[16:31] under pressure. Uh I'm just bringing
[16:33] this up because on Friday we got uh EU,
[16:37] we're going to do 50% tariffs. Then we
[16:39] got Apple threatening Apple. Um market
[16:42] didn't really care too much. And the
[16:43] reason it didn't care too much is we've
[16:46] been through this before. They could be
[16:47] off by the time Monday comes. But more
[16:49] importantly, there is a negotiation
[16:51] going down and we've already shown that
[16:54] we are going to grow our way out.
[16:55] Remember what Scott Besson just said?
[16:56] We're going to grow our way out. Okay?
[16:58] So, we're going to use tariffs again to
[17:00] not grow our way out and go through the
[17:02] same thing. Um, this is really because
[17:04] in the press they've been saying that
[17:05] Trump was broken by the Chinese. And
[17:08] regardless of whether you believe that
[17:09] or not, the reality is, um, we're
[17:12] playing hard ball again. Uh, the S&P
[17:14] finally had a correction, 2.6% 6% after
[17:17] we had four massive weeks, we were due
[17:20] for a pullback. Uh, and we got it. It
[17:23] put the S&P back to the 200 day. This is
[17:25] the SPY. What I want you to see is even
[17:27] on a day like Friday with the tariffs,
[17:29] we're closing above the opening. We had
[17:31] one day that ended up closing near the
[17:33] lows. Uh, but other than that, even on
[17:36] the tariff, uh, the Moody's downgrade
[17:38] Monday closed on the highs. uh the
[17:41] market is still showing the same
[17:42] characteristics which is one where
[17:44] people are left bearish and left
[17:47] underexposed. The bearish sentiment
[17:49] continues to come down but again we're
[17:51] nowhere at the point of where people
[17:53] have put their money to work. Hedge
[17:54] funds have added 25 billion of short
[17:56] equity futures in the last three coot
[17:58] reports. Massive massive massive uh
[18:01] increase. Um Warren PI is just some some
[18:05] stats. The S&P got up to 19.7% off the
[18:08] lows earlier in the week. If this turned
[18:11] out to be a bare market rally, would we
[18:12] rank as the fourth largest on record.
[18:15] So, the bounce that we've had to go back
[18:18] down and retest the lows and make new
[18:20] lows uh would be the fourth uh fourth
[18:24] largest in terms of a bounce. Also, the
[18:27] S&P has retraced as of May 20th 85% of
[18:30] its peak to trroth decline to market.
[18:31] has never retraced this much of a bare
[18:33] market and subsequently revisited the
[18:35] lows. Every time you hear people say
[18:37] we're going to the lows, I highlighted
[18:39] all the people that said that last week.
[18:41] Um whether or not they believe it or
[18:43] whether or not they're just can't um
[18:46] unanchor from where they were. Uh the
[18:49] reality is that people are still
[18:51] responding on the hedge fund side to
[18:52] negative news as a reason to sell, but
[18:55] they don't have chips on the table to
[18:56] play the downside very much anymore. So
[18:59] every time that they short things, if
[19:01] they run into buybacks and they run into
[19:03] retail continuing to buy, and most
[19:06] importantly, they run into the
[19:08] magnificent seven reported first quarter
[19:10] year-over-year EPS growth of
[19:13] 28%. Why are you shorting the market
[19:16] when the most important stocks have
[19:18] earnings growth of 28%. The rest, the
[19:21] remainder of the S&P had only nine. It
[19:24] exceeded consensus estimates by 16% and
[19:28] they kept capex going and we have Nvidia
[19:31] coming up this week. It just doesn't
[19:33] make sense to me when the economy is
[19:35] fined. Here are the reality on the
[19:38] economy. Again, the hard data jobless
[19:41] claims continue to sit at exactly the
[19:43] same level. So, by now we were supposed
[19:45] to see the job losses because of the
[19:47] tariffs. We haven't seen the job losses
[19:48] which means consumer spending is fine.
[19:51] Yes, the soft surveys, all the people
[19:53] who hate Trump, all the people that are
[19:55] uncertain about the future, they are
[19:57] still spending money. They can say
[19:58] whatever they want, but the data shows
[20:00] that right now, no one has changed
[20:02] anything until people start losing their
[20:04] jobs. It doesn't matter. And oh, by the
[20:06] way, junk spreads went down to the
[20:09] all-time tights.
[20:11] Again, these two things would not be
[20:14] doing that if there were any problems in
[20:16] the economy. City Surprise Index just
[20:18] went up to the highest level since
[20:20] February. I talked about this last week.
[20:23] You don't want to be fading the market
[20:26] when we just came out of a bare negative
[20:28] sentiment point and people are still
[20:30] bearish and we have outperformance of
[20:34] data relative to lowered expectations,
[20:36] which is what happens when economists
[20:38] get to a 50% recession. The last one we
[20:41] had was right here. This is what the
[20:43] city surprise index did. This was on
[20:45] that silliness of the sam rule and the
[20:48] yen carry trade. Amazon CEO, he probably
[20:51] matters a lot. Um, tariffs have indented
[20:53] consumer spending. We have not seen
[20:57] any any change in
[21:01] demand. Ken Henry McVey, good friend,
[21:04] uh, former Morgan Stanley partner with
[21:07] me and he does excellent work. he put
[21:10] out something, the art of learning,
[21:11] which is coincidence considering I just
[21:13] wrote a paper myself, uh, using the art
[21:16] of learning the book. Um, but he goes
[21:19] through things and he covers a lot of
[21:20] ground. One of the things he brings up,
[21:22] which again is why I like Henry, he's
[21:24] adjusting to the fact that the weaker
[21:27] dollar is actually a good thing. And
[21:29] what he highlights here is service
[21:31] exports are actually more valuable than
[21:33] goods imports on a gross profit. and
[21:35] he's focusing on the profit side, which
[21:37] again matters more than anything because
[21:39] if the profits remain high in the S&P
[21:41] 500, then the stock market remains
[21:42] higher. The number one driving force for
[21:44] the economy is the S&P 500, particularly
[21:46] for household net worth. Henry knows how
[21:49] to cover it. He's covering it well. He
[21:51] travels the world. Services account for
[21:53] fully 84% of US private sector
[21:56] employment. I've highlighted the same
[21:57] thing. This whole thing with tariffs is
[22:00] an
[22:01] 1800s bunch of crap that people are
[22:03] paying attention to as the big thing,
[22:06] especially when China is the only real
[22:07] thing that matters from the supply chain
[22:09] disruptions that we were going to have.
[22:10] We have not solved the tariff thing.
[22:12] Nothing is completely done, but we do
[22:14] know the way that we're playing poker on
[22:16] this. So unless until we get people that
[22:18] are optimistic again and actually have
[22:21] positioning on in that I I just think
[22:23] that there's going to be a bid
[22:24] underneath and we'll grind our way to
[22:26] all-time highs and it'll take an
[22:27] earnings report like Nvidia to be kind
[22:30] of the deciding factor on for the time
[22:32] being whether we're going to hit new
[22:33] all-time highs before we get far into
[22:36] June or whether we're going to pull back
[22:38] again because they beat earnings but
[22:40] people are worried again and then we
[22:42] consolidate more around the 200 day
[22:44] moving average. Um, I don't want to
[22:46] minimize the impact of the rates, but I
[22:48] do want to show you what's important
[22:49] about it. So, this is the Ponzi
[22:53] scheme. Higher or lower highs, lower
[22:56] lows continuously from 1980 all the way
[22:59] on. This is every time we have a
[23:01] recession, we print money to get out of
[23:04] it. Every single time we get a rise in
[23:07] rates after that, then we go down to the
[23:08] next one. Then we reset, reset, reset,
[23:11] reset. the private sector, households,
[23:14] and non-financial businesses. Like I
[23:16] showed you, the reason that their
[23:17] leverage has come down is because
[23:19] everyone locked in either long-term
[23:21] yields on the non-financial corporate
[23:23] side by terming out their debt or they
[23:26] locked in very low mortgage rates. So,
[23:28] you go all the way down here, but then
[23:30] we've started to go higher. So, there
[23:32] are issues that show up, and I don't
[23:34] want to minimize them. This is the first
[23:36] time. This is a broken trend. If you
[23:38] look back, this is from 5 years ago now.
[23:40] There's no time in this entire period
[23:42] where you can find five years later
[23:45] where you're higher than you were at
[23:47] that point. It's just not possible.
[23:49] We've been making lower lows. So for any
[23:51] businesses that have been dependent on
[23:53] it, which are not many anymore, uh
[23:55] because we just don't have leverage in
[23:57] the system, you do have leverage in this
[24:00] illquid private equity just goes
[24:03] bidless. I'm bringing this up because
[24:05] this problem is becoming a bigger issue.
[24:08] And to me, it lines up with my beliefs
[24:10] in both the change in rates and the
[24:13] change in AI. AI makes the future less
[24:16] certain for all businesses. Businesses
[24:18] will be disrupted and will go out of
[24:19] business faster than they ever have.
[24:21] What Amazon did to the mall retailers
[24:23] will look like nothing compared to
[24:25] artificial intelligence and its
[24:27] destruction of businesses. If you're a
[24:30] private equity firm and you have
[24:32] companies that you've been sitting on,
[24:34] that disruption increases because it's
[24:36] happening faster. We are not going to
[24:38] bail out the system. So if you think
[24:40] about what has happened and you looked
[24:41] at that chart, anytime that there was a
[24:43] problem in private equity, it always got
[24:45] bailed out by rates moving lower. Now
[24:47] rates are moving higher. So what's
[24:48] happened is presidents squeezing
[24:51] hardford will lead Harvard will lead to
[24:53] selloff in private equity. Once the
[24:56] great thing about illlquid assets is
[24:58] they're not marked. The bad thing about
[25:00] them is if they start selling there's no
[25:02] liquidity and once they start getting
[25:03] marked and people start worrying about
[25:06] him it's an issue. So these are all news
[25:08] stories that are coming across there
[25:10] when Bessant Harvard is a giant hedge
[25:14] fund. We're going to look back on this
[25:16] in six months. These are the waitings of
[25:18] the endowments for asset allocation and
[25:20] this is going through eight Ivy League
[25:22] schools in Stanford and MIT. Uh I don't
[25:25] understand why they don't have um
[25:29] uh venture in here. I don't know why it
[25:31] doesn't show up, but they're showing the
[25:33] private equity side and how big it is.
[25:36] The numbers are staggering for VC real
[25:38] estate and private equity according to
[25:41] Bill Aman. And if you haven't seen this
[25:44] um interview that he did at Austin,
[25:46] Texas, uh at the University of Austin,
[25:48] it's worth going. One thing I believe is
[25:50] that the private equity VC and real
[25:52] estate portfolios are mismarked. For
[25:55] everyone who's going to argue there
[25:56] isn't a mismarking, they're full of
[25:58] crap. Uh there absolutely is. Um the FT
[26:02] had an article on Friday. IRR is private
[26:04] equity's favorite measure of returns,
[26:06] but it is tra tragicomically flawed and
[26:08] often used to bamboozle investors. Love
[26:10] Robin Wigglesworth. Um again, this is
[26:14] not to try and like go in. This is just
[26:16] a reality of what's going on. Private
[26:18] equity is troubled $1 trillion Kuwait
[26:21] fund boss warns and as you just go
[26:23] through
[26:24] it the industry is struggling to
[26:27] monetize assets due to valuation gap
[26:29] between buyers and sellers leading to
[26:30] the use of continuation vehicles to
[26:32] generate returns this is not just a
[26:35] problem there I've said the mag 7 is
[26:36] going to go through a similar thing the
[26:38] only difference is they're liquid now I
[26:41] like to use charts and assets I created
[26:43] an index of private equity these are all
[26:45] the listed private equity firms so I
[26:47] have the six big ones in here. They've
[26:50] lagged on the bounce and here's them
[26:53] relative to the S&P. Uh this is not a
[26:56] canary in the coal mine because I don't
[26:58] view this as a big problem. But I think
[26:59] these businesses just have issues as
[27:02] long as rates are going to stay high and
[27:03] we're not having a recession. This why I
[27:05] always say that everyone in this
[27:06] industry, hedge funds, VC, they want a
[27:09] recession. They want rates lower and
[27:11] rates aren't moving lower. And we just
[27:13] found out that there's almost zero
[27:15] chance of them moving lower. So
[27:17] everyone's rooting for recession. That's
[27:18] the logic that goes in. But the
[27:20] government's not doing that. They're
[27:22] focused on Main Street and they're
[27:23] focused on the median voter. They're not
[27:25] focused on the high-end. So the wealth
[27:27] that was created in tech in long
[27:29] duration assets, there's a repricing.
[27:32] This is not a default. This is a
[27:34] repricing. They are
[27:36] mispriced. AI again very important to
[27:40] this whole conversation. Listen to
[27:41] Sergey Brin talk for I I reached in last
[27:45] week's video. I begged people above the
[27:47] age of uh of 50. I had four of them
[27:50] reach out to talk about AI and talk
[27:52] about crypto. People that I can have a
[27:54] conversation with and I had some good
[27:56] ones this week and I thank you guys for
[27:58] reaching out. I have a couple more that
[28:00] I think are on the same topic. If you
[28:02] don't use AI and you aren't spending all
[28:04] of your time listening to it and you're
[28:06] still reading about tariffs and the
[28:07] history of of uh debt default and Liz
[28:11] trust moments and all this stuff, if
[28:13] you're making money with that this year,
[28:14] go for it. I I'm I'm surprised you are.
[28:17] But if you've been able to time the
[28:18] markets and go through it, that's great.
[28:20] AI is the most important force and the
[28:22] one that's going to make you the most
[28:23] money because it'll eventually lead you
[28:24] to Bitcoin, which is the best performing
[28:26] asset in the world. Again, whether we
[28:28] have a down market, whether we have an
[28:29] up market, and I'll go through the
[28:30] reason why. Eric Schmidt TED talk
[28:32] released again. Amazing to listen to
[28:35] Sergey and listen to Eric Schmidt to the
[28:36] original people uh or the early people
[28:39] with Google. Um Stripe, I brought this
[28:41] up. This is the disruption side. I just
[28:43] want to I show this and I repeatedly
[28:45] talk about this with Pomp on our weekly
[28:48] podcast. This is why all businesses are
[28:51] screwed that exist. The time to grow a
[28:54] business with no people. That's the one
[28:56] thing he doesn't include in here is how
[28:58] few people it took to get to here versus
[29:01] the SAS company of 37 months. Look at
[29:04] that decline. 28month difference. So,
[29:07] you're talking about almost a
[29:10] 75% change in how fast things move right
[29:13] now. Seriously, go through that in your
[29:16] head and realize what's happening. This
[29:18] is why small businesses that have debt
[29:20] have no chance, in my opinion, of
[29:23] outperforming the big guys. The big guys
[29:25] will eventually lose to that side, which
[29:27] is the startup businesses. It'll take
[29:29] some time. In the meantime, you're going
[29:31] to have multiples expand, multiples
[29:33] contract, but overall, we're going to
[29:35] see private business, private sector,
[29:38] true private sector, not the public
[29:40] markets, but the private markets growing
[29:42] rapidly. Uh, Satcha Nadella at their
[29:45] build event, um, the amount of things
[29:47] coming out at Microsoft, you can go read
[29:49] them. I'm not going to take you through
[29:50] this, but the age of agents begins,
[29:52] again, I talk about this for two
[29:54] important things. One is the adoption
[29:56] side. This speeds it up because you
[29:58] don't depend on the humans to do it.
[30:00] It's actually through the computers.
[30:01] They go through the agentic cases. Talk
[30:03] about MCP which I brought up many times
[30:06] which Enthropic put out. This was out in
[30:07] November. I played around this a lot.
[30:09] This is really critical to the
[30:11] agentic side and then the science
[30:14] breakthroughs he went through as well.
[30:15] And then you had Jensen Yuang speak at
[30:18] Computex talking about
[30:22] how it's we're basically at the hardware
[30:25] side. So you really need to go listen to
[30:27] it to go through trans transformation
[30:29] from a GPU maker to an AI infrastructure
[30:31] company akin to electricity and the
[30:33] internet. Uh it's now the third grade
[30:36] infrastructure after power and
[30:38] information. I I'm not going to go read
[30:40] all these things. You guys just have to
[30:41] go spend time on it and go watch them
[30:43] and listen to them. I wrote uh a
[30:46] Substack and released it at 22V as well
[30:50] uh due to how well it had done on
[30:51] Substack. It all talks about the book,
[30:54] The Art of Learning, but it really gets
[30:56] into my beliefs that if people want to
[30:59] adapt to AI, this is my journey back
[31:02] really from 2013 when I decided to first
[31:05] go to Silicon Valley and listen to
[31:07] Singularity and listen to what was
[31:09] coming. So, I've been in this for 12
[31:11] years. It's what eventually led me to
[31:12] Bitcoin. It's the whole key thing. So
[31:14] for those of you that are having a
[31:16] frustrating time this year, remember
[31:18] none of the things that are happening,
[31:20] rates moving higher, restructuring of
[31:22] global trade, capital controls, AI, none
[31:25] of these are going away and not in your
[31:27] life, not in your business lifetime. So
[31:30] you got to make some adjustment and the
[31:31] adjustment would be to learn more about
[31:33] what's happening in AI. Uh this is
[31:36] something that I'm sure I'll be talking
[31:38] more about, but you got to go read about
[31:42] nanoobots. Again, this is the embodiment
[31:44] of AI. Nano robots in your body to make
[31:46] us immortal by 2030. Ray Kurszswwell,
[31:49] who's probably had a 70% hit rate on
[31:51] most of his predictions going back to
[31:53] the 1980s in terms of where we would be.
[31:56] Uh we're getting to crisper on the body.
[31:58] So, all of these
[32:00] are all of these are coming in the next
[32:03] year to three years in terms of them
[32:06] being utilized. We've done the same
[32:07] thing on Neurolink. And then AI drug
[32:10] design uh will save millions of lives.
[32:13] We're just at the point where you have
[32:14] to pay more attention to what's
[32:16] happening on longevity. It'll also have
[32:18] a macro impact uh a big one too and it
[32:21] should lead to theoretically uh at some
[32:24] point if AI goes through it some demand
[32:27] for treasuries. Uh but at this point I
[32:32] rather than focus on any of that AI is
[32:33] just an important thing for this year.
[32:36] Okay. an executive order. Trump spent a
[32:38] lot of time on nuclear and speeding up.
[32:39] Remember what he did with the vaccine in
[32:42] terms of eliminating the regulations. Uh
[32:44] there's going to be a tremendous amount
[32:45] of investments in nuclear. Want to see
[32:48] this grow. This is going to be again
[32:51] another phase of expansion on the growth
[32:53] side. And for those of you who haven't
[32:55] paid attention, go read about bonus
[32:57] depreciation and what they put in the
[32:59] tax bill. It's going to help the
[33:01] buildout of the data centers and the
[33:03] energy that's needed for it. Don't fade
[33:06] the economy on the back of AI. Bernstein
[33:08] says US gas super cycle is coming. All
[33:11] right. So now over to AI and Bitcoin.
[33:15] But before we do that, CZ who was the
[33:18] founder of Binance gave an interview
[33:20] with Raul Powell. Uh I listened to it
[33:23] and I just wanted to highlight the
[33:24] currency for AI is crypto. This is again
[33:26] the linkage between AI. Humans generate
[33:29] 300 trillion tokens a day. again AI.
[33:32] Soon AI will generate 10 times that. As
[33:36] AI begins trading with
[33:38] AI, AI begins trading with AI. Again,
[33:41] this is the crypto side of blockchain
[33:43] secur sec secures data and payments.
[33:44] Productivity decouples from humans. CZ
[33:48] predicts GDP may no longer be tied to
[33:50] people. This is what I talk about as GD
[33:52] as no recessions possible and anyone
[33:55] paying attention to interest rates and
[33:57] credit and recessions and the way they
[34:00] went through it and the jobs. It's just
[34:03] not possible the way it was in the past.
[34:06] So bad week for Wall Street's old guard.
[34:10] This is my uh 50 and above people I want
[34:12] to talk to who know the macro side but
[34:15] also know AI and crypto as crypto burns
[34:18] the haters. This was out uh Friday late
[34:22] after the market closed. I had just put
[34:26] out my own thing minutes before and then
[34:28] the reporter reached out to me and and
[34:30] asked uh if I'd be involved in the next
[34:33] time. Bitcoin is back at alltime highs
[34:34] last up here. I did this thread. It's
[34:36] about 182 Y of why this week in
[34:40] particular and what went on with the tax
[34:42] bill with all the things that I showed
[34:44] is the most important thing for Bitcoin
[34:47] and why Bitcoin is sitting at all-time
[34:49] highs. We talked about this Pomp and I
[34:52] did uh 13 days
[34:55] ago and I didn't pick the title getting
[34:57] squeezed to alltime highs. We're there
[34:59] now. We talked this week uh probably the
[35:02] most important interview that we've done
[35:03] together in terms of conversation. Uh I
[35:06] will say if you haven't watched any of
[35:08] them, watch the one that probably um
[35:10] will be released early Saturday morning.
[35:12] I go through a lot of the situation that
[35:15] I put out in the thread. This was a big
[35:18] week and I think we're very likely to
[35:20] realize something in Bitcoin very soon
[35:22] which is an upside crash is more likely
[35:26] in this with this going on than any kind
[35:29] of a down s downside move and I think it
[35:32] will make all of this look ridiculous.
[35:34] So on my wave count we are in a third
[35:37] wave right now. I expect something
[35:40] breathtaking to happen this year on
[35:43] squeezes on the upside. I think there's
[35:46] a lot of people that are going to get
[35:47] caught in this. It'll propel this to
[35:49] where I predicted at the beginning of
[35:51] the year and we'll keep saying this will
[35:53] be the second biggest asset in the world
[35:55] by the end of the year. It continues to
[35:57] move higher. It started the year behind
[35:59] silver. We're now up to number five as
[36:02] of
[36:03] 109,000. We will because I still believe
[36:06] we will more than double this year.
[36:09] We're up about 20% so far this year.
[36:11] That'll put us above that level. It's
[36:13] still coming soon.
[36:15] And remember right now it's Bitcoin
[36:17] alone. This is not the other side. So
[36:19] Ethereum is down sizably for the year.
[36:23] Uh and we haven't broken above the 200
[36:25] day moving average. We failed there a
[36:27] few times. Salana failed at the 200 day
[36:30] moving average down for the year. So so
[36:32] far the crypto market cap has not broken
[36:35] through the pre-Tump Trump highs. Uh
[36:38] remember this is right as the meme Trump
[36:41] memecoin came out and everything broke
[36:44] down. This is the altcoins or I'm sorry
[36:46] this is market cap without bitcoin. So
[36:49] you can see that it looks a lot like the
[36:50] ethereum and salana chart except worse
[36:52] because they're probably up here. And
[36:54] then you've got the altcoins down here.
[36:57] So we haven't this is not a a euphoric
[37:00] move at this point. This is being led by
[37:02] an asset that's being accumulated by
[37:05] corporations, countries, endowments,
[37:08] pension funds around the globe. There's
[37:10] more and more countries. And at some
[37:12] point, I'm sure we will get some kind of
[37:14] announcement from a government around
[37:16] the world who's either bought it or is
[37:18] saying they're going to buy it that
[37:19] matters. And at that point, I think
[37:22] you're going to have, you know, wild
[37:25] speculation start and people really be
[37:28] scared of missing out. I've said all
[37:30] year that the MAG 7 being around flat
[37:33] for the year, which is where I expect it
[37:34] overall for the year on multiple
[37:36] compression, not on earnings coming
[37:38] down, but on multiple compression
[37:40] because they are a long duration asset
[37:42] and where Bitcoin is going higher and
[37:43] the benefit it has is it has no
[37:46] valuation. So again, I'll keep saying
[37:48] it. Everyone who said I don't know how
[37:50] to value it, how do you value private
[37:52] equity? How do you v value VC? How do
[37:55] you value real estate? This has always
[37:57] been to me. Every asset is
[37:59] difficult to value. How do you value a
[38:01] company in the S&P 500? You're taking a
[38:04] discounted cash flow of the future. It
[38:06] has nothing to do with today. And in a
[38:07] linear world where competition does not
[38:09] happen fast, that makes sense. It does
[38:11] not make sense in a world where
[38:13] competition is going at the pace that
[38:15] Stripe is showing you. Readjust your
[38:18] mindset. Ticking time bomb. $40 trillion
[38:21] big Fed print. We are going to, as I
[38:23] said, get something. If we get capital
[38:25] controls, Bitcoin's outside the system.
[38:27] It goes straight up if we get QE because
[38:30] we have to do it at some point. Whether
[38:33] it's allowing the banks to do it or us
[38:34] to do it to keep tenure rates in. You
[38:36] want to buy more. If Asia's repatriating
[38:39] their dollars, they need to put that
[38:40] money to work. They're continually
[38:42] looking for different assets. Bitcoin's
[38:44] outside of the system. It's outside of
[38:46] the dollar. It's outside of the yen.
[38:48] It's outside of everything. You don't
[38:51] want to own fiat currencies. They're all
[38:53] weakening. And this is related to gold
[38:56] and Bitcoin outperforms gold. So let's
[38:59] just keep going through the whole thing
[39:02] and remember Arthur Hayes predicts
[39:04] Bitcoin could soar to 1 million by 2028
[39:07] not from ATS but capital controls. This
[39:09] is not
[39:11] about anything more than what people are
[39:14] ignoring. We're at a different stage of
[39:17] the fiat system. This is the end of it.
[39:19] This is a new system that is being
[39:21] created on the back of technology in the
[39:24] digital economy that is a reality. Cup
[39:26] and handle technical formations say
[39:29] positive for this Bitcoin option traders
[39:32] I 300,000 with record high insight. I
[39:34] believe there will be a short squeeze
[39:36] and part of it will be the massive
[39:38] covering of call options that there are
[39:41] massive sellers in that I've shown on
[39:43] this exchange Derbit which was just
[39:45] purchased by Coinbase. Um, I've been
[39:48] told these are people that are selling
[39:50] to enhance yield. They are also uh
[39:54] companies that are selling for future
[39:56] production. All kinds of reasons that
[39:58] people are collecting money on
[40:00] businesses because there's no income
[40:02] related to Bitcoin. That will eventually
[40:05] lead to problems. I'm a derivative
[40:06] person. I've seen it before. And it
[40:08] reminds me of the nickel squeeze that
[40:10] happened in 2022 for commodity
[40:12] producers. You try to increase the
[40:14] amount of cash flow or yields and
[40:16] eventually it comes to bite you. Uh the
[40:18] genius act. Okay, so stable coins again
[40:21] I talked about it. Eventually the
[40:22] Democrats would have to cave major US
[40:24] banks mold jointly launching stable
[40:26] coins. Stable coins are the network
[40:28] effect for the ecosystem and that money
[40:30] ends up in Bitcoin or at least a portion
[40:32] of it eventually. And Jaime Diamond,
[40:35] after years
[40:37] of saying any employee who traded
[40:39] Bitcoin was stupid, called it a fraud.
[40:43] Last year, he called the cryptocurrency
[40:45] a pet rock. But this week, Diamond
[40:47] announced that JP Morgan Chase allows
[40:49] clients to buy Bitcoin. Again, here's
[40:51] the reality. Michael Sailor says
[40:54] it. You don't find Bitcoin, Bitcoin
[40:56] finds you. Eventually, when you need to
[41:00] do this, as Jaime Diamond did, he needed
[41:03] to say this. And why did he need to say
[41:05] it? Because every other bank's getting
[41:07] involved in it. So, at some point, if
[41:09] you're that person who's Jaime Diamond
[41:10] that says, "I don't want to be involved
[41:12] in it." And you manage money for someone
[41:13] else and an asset that's going up 100%
[41:16] the last two years. It is on pace right
[41:18] now for 50% this year. How do you avoid
[41:21] it? Other than just
[41:23] being the thing of stupid or just being
[41:27] inflexible or living in a past system
[41:30] where it's going past you, everything in
[41:33] there. If you're the person that had
[41:35] trouble transitioning away to streaming
[41:37] on your TV and you still have a cable
[41:39] wire so that your your TV doesn't look
[41:41] as good as having Wi-Fi, sorry, you're
[41:44] going to be the one who misses it. This
[41:46] is going higher. This is part of it. And
[41:48] the reason it's going higher is because
[41:49] the current system is breaking down and
[41:50] this is the new system. The guardrails
[41:52] are being put up. Circle launches stable
[41:54] coin powered crossber payments
[41:57] network. JD Vance is speaking this week
[42:01] at Bitcoin. Whenever Trump JD Vance
[42:05] speak at a Bitcoin event, I would say at
[42:08] this point it's mustwatch TV. They are
[42:10] telling you all the time that they
[42:14] believe that we need to be the digital
[42:16] asset leader in the world. So if they're
[42:18] going to speak at events, there's always
[42:20] a chance that they could say something
[42:21] that's positive for the event. I can't
[42:22] imagine it's negative other than a sell
[42:24] the news type scenario, but that's going
[42:27] on this week. All right, guys. That's it
[42:28] for me. Have a great weekend. Uh, I'll
[42:31] check in with you next
