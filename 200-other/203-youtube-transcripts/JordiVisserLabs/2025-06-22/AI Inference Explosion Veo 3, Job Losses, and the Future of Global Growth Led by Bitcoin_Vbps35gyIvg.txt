--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] week. Um, I'm not going to read through
[00:01] all these. You can pause it here and go
[00:03] through it yourself. Uh, got a lot to
[00:06] cover. Uh, just in terms of the finish
[00:09] for May, it was the best month since
[00:13] 2023. Charts look great above the 200
[00:16] day now for a couple weeks. Continued to
[00:18] consolidate here just below all-time
[00:21] highs. You can see some of the moving
[00:23] averages crossing above. So, the 20-day
[00:25] is now above the the 200 day. and the
[00:28] NDX looks uh even better. So, the
[00:30] technology stuff has uh has really not
[00:33] only bounced back but been leading the
[00:34] way. Uh MSCI World X the US uh also all
[00:40] the way back and this is at all-time
[00:42] highs. So, pretty much across the board
[00:45] it's been a big rally. The Russell 2000
[00:47] continues to lag uh behind. Uh, I'll
[00:50] spend some time on that later and I'll
[00:52] show this chart twice, but just so you
[00:54] see it, this is IWM over the
[00:57] QQQs. This is the launch of the iPhone.
[00:59] This is the launch of Chat GPT. We'll
[01:02] get through that as we get later into
[01:04] this. Rates continue to go sideways
[01:07] here. Again, uh, you know, all this
[01:10] stuff on how deadly rates are getting
[01:12] and things. We've been sitting up around
[01:15] this area now for multiple years. And
[01:18] just to show it, this is the 100w week
[01:21] uh moving average. So again, we're
[01:23] talking about two years and we're just
[01:25] above where we've been for two years. So
[01:29] uh there's just not a uh a big thing
[01:33] coming from the rate market until we get
[01:34] a significant rise. And even then, I
[01:37] don't think it's going to do what people
[01:38] want. Uh on the bearish side in terms of
[01:40] the bare bull sentiment, we got briefly
[01:44] above the net zero line where there were
[01:47] more more bulls and bears, but uh that
[01:50] dropped back down again. So the
[01:51] sentiment is still at best cautious. It
[01:56] is definitely not bullish. And just to
[01:58] kind of do Barkclay's put this out this
[02:00] week and measured everyone in terms of
[02:02] Zcore of equity positioning across
[02:04] strategies and you can see that again
[02:06] regardless of what you're doing um
[02:09] overall the sentiment is
[02:11] still it's caught uh didn't participate
[02:14] in the rally and doesn't believe it and
[02:17] despite a lot of the changes uh the
[02:19] sentiment is still sitting there. So uh
[02:22] we started to get the soft data bounce
[02:23] that I talked about the last couple
[02:25] weeks. Uh this was the consumer
[02:28] confidence
[02:29] expectations change for the month. 17
[02:32] point jump, the biggest since the two
[02:34] months coming out of the great financial
[02:36] crisis. So soft data picking up. Uh in
[02:41] terms of surprise index, we finished the
[02:43] month with the best of the year now in
[02:46] terms of the city surprise index for the
[02:48] US going up best since uh late last year
[02:52] or coming out of the SAM rule bounce
[02:54] again. And again, this these are
[02:56] relative to expectations. So whenever
[02:58] there's a bearish recession thing,
[03:00] that's when you typically get the data
[03:02] surprising on the upside. Europe best
[03:05] month also since last summer. uh
[03:08] EM really strong, biggest since 2023.
[03:11] This is a bigger story. I will go
[03:13] through some stuff on EM uh which uh is
[03:16] an area I like, but in particular South
[03:19] America and my former home of Brazil. Uh
[03:23] just in terms of the the GDP number, um
[03:26] I just want to highlight how steady
[03:28] things have been. There was a lot of
[03:29] noise obviously because of all the the
[03:32] inventory build, the imports, the whole
[03:34] thing. But if you just take the final
[03:36] sales to private domestic producers,
[03:38] which is what Powell mentioned in the
[03:40] most recent
[03:42] uh FOMC meeting uh uh press conference,
[03:47] just look how steady it is. You're just
[03:49] everything is just growing fine and
[03:51] we're basically in the exact same area
[03:53] we were during here. So uh final sales
[03:56] fine and now for Q2 because we got the
[03:59] bounce back on the trade side uh after a
[04:02] a
[04:04] minus.3% we're looking at right now for
[04:06] GDP now 3.8% in Q2. Uh I thought this
[04:12] was good in terms of just trying to
[04:13] highlight again something I've talked
[04:15] about which is uh instead of no tariffs
[04:18] let's just say the tariffs have come
[04:19] down significantly. We got tax cuts
[04:21] through, fiscal p package from Germany,
[04:25] stimulus from China, global easing
[04:27] cycle, oil prices down, the AI capex
[04:30] boom not only continues but is going
[04:32] higher and we're about to get a major
[04:34] productivity boost. I'll go through this
[04:36] later and no integration so the un
[04:38] unemployment rate doesn't spike. I will
[04:40] talk about that as well, but basically
[04:42] with all that going on, there should be
[04:44] more positivity than there is. Uh but
[04:47] this is all related to the losses that
[04:49] people posted and the fact that they
[04:51] didn't
[04:52] buy in the days after this uh silly
[04:56] thing. Um obviously the big news for the
[04:58] week, a trade court ruled President
[05:00] Trump didn't have the authority to do
[05:02] the tariffs. So that keeps tariffs on
[05:03] the headline. Uh and I fully believe
[05:07] that he is on a mission from God to do
[05:10] uh what he believes is the right thing
[05:12] to do and nothing is going to stop what
[05:14] he's planning. Uh and I think that's a
[05:16] given already, you know, over fri late
[05:20] Friday doubles the steel tariffs. So the
[05:22] tariffs are not going away. And I just
[05:24] want to remind people that uh when Scott
[05:27] Besson gave this interview and in
[05:31] November said he sees a global economic
[05:33] reordering, he wants to be part of it
[05:34] again. This is the Steven Mirren
[05:38] uh playbook. Uh and it's starting to now
[05:42] go again into something I talked about
[05:44] last week. You're going to hear me talk
[05:45] about it a lot because it is the other
[05:47] side of the trade. If you're not able to
[05:49] do trade, then that would increase the
[05:51] other direction, which is okay, fine. If
[05:53] the trade balance is the issue on one
[05:56] end, well, then we have too much capital
[05:57] on the other end that's come in. And so,
[05:59] an obscure tax item in the Trump bill
[06:02] alarms Wall Street. So, this was in
[06:04] Thursday, and you're starting to get
[06:05] people realizing about capital control.
[06:08] So this is the net investment foreign
[06:11] investment in US assets which is now up
[06:13] at $30 trillion. So in the tax bill and
[06:18] we'll see from the house if it is t if
[06:20] it is taken out in the senate uh which
[06:22] is some of the
[06:24] discussion. You've got these points in
[06:26] there where now there's tax implications
[06:29] possibly if we want to tax people uh
[06:32] foreigners taking money outside the
[06:34] country. So by having it in there, I
[06:37] just want to remind people Mirren's
[06:38] primary focus is on tariffs and currency
[06:40] adjustment. He acknowledges that if
[06:41] multilateral efforts to realign
[06:42] currencies fail, unilateral measures,
[06:44] including capital
[06:46] controls, could be employed. Um this is
[06:50] just really important. Now the currency
[06:52] has weakened, so you'd think it was
[06:54] less, but again this is being brought
[06:56] up. So the AEI this week or the end of
[06:59] last week, Congress should not impose
[07:01] capital controls. The House version of
[07:02] the uh big beautiful bill introduces
[07:05] three and a half% excite tax on
[07:07] remittances. Finally, most concerning
[07:09] that a tax on remittances may be viewed
[07:11] as a step towards broader capital
[07:13] controls. I just want to make sure you
[07:14] guys keep this in the back of your mind
[07:16] and I'm going to reiterate. You should
[07:18] go listen to this podcast with Russell
[07:20] Napier who talks about the fact that all
[07:21] trade wars at the end of the day are
[07:23] capital wars. Um in the UK this week
[07:26] confirms powers to force pension funds
[07:28] to back British assets. Again, you're
[07:32] starting to see this happening.
[07:34] Nationalism, which is what Russell
[07:35] Napier talks about, and capital controls
[07:38] fit in with that. Also, what fits into
[07:41] that is the fact that if Asia decides
[07:44] that uh their $7 half trillion dollar
[07:47] bet on US assets suddenly unraveling,
[07:49] repatriation becomes a theme. And if
[07:52] Donald Trump wants to figure a way to
[07:54] make sure that if they're going to pull
[07:55] their money out, they're paying for it.
[07:57] uh that's where you get into the
[08:00] situation again of of of capital
[08:02] controls. So the other thing inside here
[08:05] that Mirren specifically mentioned in
[08:07] his paper was China and the fact that
[08:10] their currency is a major issue. So
[08:12] remember the biggest trade deficits with
[08:13] China their currency is pegged and just
[08:16] an idea we've seen the dollar weaken
[08:18] this year. Yes. But when you go look at
[08:21] okay it's it's weaker against all these
[08:24] currencies the yen 8% blah blah blah.
[08:26] And then you come down to China and
[08:29] zero. This is the problem in the world
[08:31] is that the Chinese currency is pegged
[08:34] to the dollar and until something
[08:35] changes
[08:36] there, you're going to have this uh
[08:39] situation where I think the
[08:40] administration realizes that to do what
[08:42] they want to do, they're going to have
[08:43] to continue the fight up against China.
[08:45] The other thing that is starting to
[08:47] become a little bit more known uh that
[08:50] you don't hear a lot of people talk
[08:51] about is the rare earth situation. So
[08:54] the rare earth
[08:57] problem and the fact that the Chinese
[08:59] control over 90% of processed rare
[09:01] earths and how it's a massive part of
[09:04] everything from phones to uh weapons to
[09:08] humanoids basically everything
[09:10] electronic everything that would um be
[09:13] needed for AI in terms of
[09:15] semiconductors rare earth and the fact
[09:18] that China has it plus tariffs equals
[09:20] crisis um this was from Europe China
[09:22] dominates global rare earths with a 90%
[09:25] market share
[09:26] uh Brazil, Greenland. I'm bringing those
[09:29] up for reason that I'll get into in a
[09:31] little bit. Uh but this is the reason
[09:33] why, and this was this week, USChina
[09:35] trade troops risk falling apart over the
[09:37] rare earth
[09:39] exports. Uh remember when they signed
[09:43] the deal with Ukraine, it was about rare
[09:46] earth minerals. Greenland, rare earths
[09:49] attract European US interest. So when
[09:51] he's talking about Greenland and
[09:53] everyone's saying it's purely a
[09:54] strategic thing um from from a war or
[09:58] from part of the US rare earth is a
[10:01] major major part. It's a major issue
[10:04] right now and China controls it. Uh this
[10:07] is where I just want to make sure I make
[10:08] a little pivot towards Brazil which I
[10:10] referenced which is uh where in the
[10:14] world are the rare earths? So you've got
[10:16] China as the leading in reserves. So
[10:18] these are reserves. This is not mining
[10:19] production. This is mining production.
[10:21] You can see China dominating mining
[10:23] production. Um, Brazil's reserves
[10:27] massive.
[10:28] Uh, this is going to be Brazil is going
[10:31] to be a major part of the China US kind
[10:34] of fight in terms of who has access to
[10:37] the rare earth minerals. Uh, there's a
[10:39] lot of other things that China has uh in
[10:42] terms of need for technology. Again,
[10:45] this stuff has not been mined. So, this
[10:46] is a major effort. It's an
[10:48] infrastructure thing. But I think Brazil
[10:50] will benefit significantly because of
[10:53] the fight over AI and minerals and the
[10:56] amount that's needed because of what I'm
[10:58] going to go through with just the
[10:59] acceleration of AI from inference. Here
[11:02] is EWZ overlaid with the Asian dollar.
[11:05] So
[11:06] EWZ is MSCI Brazil and obviously you're
[11:09] getting the benefit of the real or the
[11:11] negativity of the real since the day
[11:13] that I left Brazil in 1998 or 1999 as
[11:16] I've shown the real has basically gone
[11:18] straight down with little pauses of
[11:20] strength and those pauses of strength
[11:21] occurred during the commodity boom when
[11:24] China was growing and importing tons of
[11:27] commodities. uh that's when their
[11:29] currency was trained since that point
[11:31] and really since the iPhone we've been
[11:32] in this perma thing like most things
[11:34] around the world where software took
[11:36] over hardware was not needed I believe
[11:38] we're transitioning now into a hardware
[11:41] um side because of the rebuild necessary
[11:44] for everything due to AI everything will
[11:46] have intelligence inside of it and this
[11:48] is a major change and I think it
[11:50] benefits Brazil despite the fact that
[11:52] it's got a fiscal deficit and all these
[11:54] other issues um if the Asian dollar is
[11:56] going to rally uh which I believe it
[11:58] will for the repatriation side and for
[12:00] the things I've talked about. Uh Brazil
[12:03] is going to be a major benefactor. If
[12:05] you want to combine uh commodities and
[12:08] the Asian dollar, uh I created a CRB uh
[12:11] metals and again this a little different
[12:14] because it's going to be dominated by
[12:15] nickel and copper which are obviously
[12:16] important but the mineral side is a
[12:18] different story. The indices inside for
[12:20] commodities are not weighted towards AR.
[12:22] They are weighted towards the industrial
[12:23] revolution. So I think this is where
[12:25] you're going to see a benefit come for
[12:28] Brazil amongst other things. But
[12:29] anything where the dollar is weakening
[12:31] is a major major part. It helps the
[12:33] inflation story there if their currency
[12:34] is strong as well. Uh and what's
[12:36] happened
[12:38] EWZ is up right now 5% so far this
[12:41] quarter. It was up big so far. So it's
[12:43] up big this year. But the reason I want
[12:44] to bring this up, you got to go back to
[12:46] 19 when we had two quarters that were
[12:48] positive. Since then you haven't been
[12:50] able to sustain anything positive. So I
[12:53] look for changes in market. I look for
[12:55] changes in things that are going on. And
[12:56] so I think Brazil is an opportunity and
[12:59] a very good
[13:00] riskreward. Uh despite the headwinds
[13:02] that they've had inside the country, I
[13:04] think you're getting the opportunity at
[13:05] a very attractive level given what's
[13:08] happening with the trade war and the
[13:09] fact that I think a weaker dollar is
[13:11] going to be the outcome and at the same
[13:13] point that you're going to have a
[13:15] uh a need for AI minerals. So, in terms
[13:18] of Nvidia, I just again they reported
[13:21] this doesn't stop. So, uh anyone who
[13:24] believed that we were peaking and that
[13:26] we weren't going to see it, it's just
[13:28] not happening. And as I go through,
[13:30] acceleration is really the name of the
[13:32] game. Uh Trump sets out, this happened
[13:35] on Friday. I didn't mention it last
[13:37] weekend, but um taking the nuclear goals
[13:41] from 100 gawatts up to 400 gawatt is
[13:45] just a massive number. Just to give you
[13:47] guys an idea, it costs about $8 billion
[13:50] of of uh cost per gigawatt. So you're
[13:54] talking about somewhere around $2.5
[13:56] trillion. And that's using older numbers
[13:58] before the tariffs and everything else
[14:00] uh plus building in any costs that are
[14:02] going higher. But you're talking about
[14:03] again on top of the capex numbers, on
[14:06] top of the uh the Stargate edition, on
[14:09] top of what Saudi Arabia, you just got a
[14:11] massive build of infrastructure which is
[14:14] going to help GDP.
[14:16] uh and again you're getting into a point
[14:18] now where the massive demand in the
[14:20] compute and the need for time uh for
[14:23] inference time resources is becoming a
[14:25] big thing. I'm including this in here
[14:27] because Demis Hassab has talked about
[14:29] I'm going to get more into this. Um
[14:31] remember I wrote this piece uh on May
[14:34] 15th about the inference inflection
[14:37] where most of where I highlighted how
[14:39] many companies had talked about the
[14:41] shift to
[14:42] inference exacerbating dramatically the
[14:45] amount of demand for compute power. This
[14:48] was a recent um report in McKenzie. You
[14:50] can go get it for free. But it goes
[14:52] through
[14:54] um the high demand that's showing up in
[14:55] the compute side. uh and in particular
[14:59] by 2030 data centers are projected to
[15:01] require $7 trillion worldwide to keep
[15:03] pace with demand for compute power uh
[15:06] and they just go through the numbers. I
[15:07] mean these things have been talked about
[15:09] before but this is just massive in terms
[15:12] of March if you remember I mentioned
[15:14] that Sachin Nadella came out and said
[15:16] that over 100 trillion 100red trillion
[15:19] tokens were what they saw as the demand
[15:21] in the first quarter with 50 of that
[15:23] coming in March. I'm just highlighting
[15:26] this to make sure to make the point on
[15:28] VO3. Our GPUs are melting. OpenAI puts a
[15:31] limiter after Jibli tsunami. So Jibli,
[15:34] if you didn't know it, it was an image
[15:36] uh
[15:38] creator uh that basically increased
[15:42] demand dramatically because of the
[15:45] inference side that was necessary to
[15:47] generate the
[15:49] videos. So this is what Demis Saba said.
[15:52] So V3 came out last week. I briefly
[15:55] mentioned it. Now I'm going to go
[15:56] through and just explain why I think
[15:58] this is so important for everything. I
[16:00] wrote a paper on it uh this week. The
[16:02] demand
[16:03] side for VO is off the charts. So if you
[16:07] haven't used it yet, uh you can either
[16:09] pay $20 a month and I think you get 10
[16:12] uh per month or you can go to the 250,
[16:15] you get like three a day or yeah, three
[16:18] a day for the month. Whatever the case
[16:20] is, 8 seconds a limited amount. And
[16:23] that's because of the massive amount of
[16:25] compute it takes for a regular prompt in
[16:27] chat GPT compared to V3 video for for 8
[16:32] seconds. You're talking about a hundred
[16:34] times the need. So the power is just the
[16:36] demand is just off the charts. Um and
[16:39] that's what he says. The demand for V3
[16:41] has been off the charts. Millions of
[16:42] videos have been generated in the past
[16:44] few days alone. now
[16:47] available. It it unless you go play with
[16:49] it and I I posted one on X that I built.
[16:52] Um I used up all of mine on the first
[16:54] day. It is insane what you can do with
[16:57] it. But when you realize and you listen
[16:59] to Demis about how much comput it takes
[17:02] now you're starting to get in why full
[17:04] self-driving, why humanoids, why the
[17:06] military stuff, anything that is
[17:08] reasoning to make decision making
[17:10] basically
[17:12] thinking it's just dramatically
[17:14] different than what you're used to from
[17:16] chat GBT. This is the next level and
[17:18] it's a hundred times and Jensen has
[17:21] talked about this repeatedly but I don't
[17:23] think people have fully grasped. So we
[17:25] are at the inference moment. We're we're
[17:26] getting acceleration and there is not
[17:29] enough supply. I read somewhere that the
[17:33] amount of GPUs if if this was open to
[17:36] everyone, it would take all the GPUs in
[17:38] the world to be able to get close to
[17:40] dealing with the demand. So, we're we're
[17:42] going to have a a a demand supply
[17:44] problem for videos and for everything
[17:46] related to humanoids and stuff going
[17:48] forward. It's just going to be hard to
[17:49] keep up. Uh so, for anyone thinking that
[17:52] we're going to be we don't need the data
[17:54] centers, it's just off base. So, uh,
[17:56] semiconductors, everything along those
[17:58] lines. Love them. I'm going to keep
[18:00] talking about them repeatedly,
[18:01] especially since most of them are
[18:03] unchanged or down from a year ago. This
[18:05] is going to be an expansion. So, uh,
[18:07] take the time, go look at uh, V3. Uh,
[18:10] Alon Musk praises
[18:13] V3. Uh, marks the end of AI's video
[18:17] silent error. It's because you get
[18:18] video. Yeah, when I gave you those 100
[18:20] times, that was just with the video. The
[18:22] audio adds another about 50%. So you're
[18:24] talking about 150 times. Uh this is
[18:26] going to be big for the gaming area.
[18:28] This is going to be big for anything on
[18:30] the movie side. The cost will go down
[18:31] dramatically. Uh I was already writing
[18:33] this pace this piece on Disney to show
[18:36] the benefits that Disney the company is
[18:38] going to see from AI and all the
[18:40] investments they've been making from
[18:42] inference uh in particular. That's where
[18:45] the benefit shows in. whether it's for
[18:46] AI agents on the call center, whether
[18:48] it's for humanoids in the parks, whether
[18:50] whether it's VR in terms of the
[18:52] entertainment side, uh a whole bunch of
[18:54] of things that needed to have the
[18:56] inference side for the benefits. But
[18:58] then VO3 comes out and you can only
[19:01] imagine that the cost of a $400 million
[19:04] Avengers movie uh would be, you know,
[19:09] 99% cheaper with this. So, you're going
[19:12] to get to the point now, and I cover it
[19:13] in in that article just about how
[19:15] different it is. Um, I just want to make
[19:17] sure generating video at a reasonable
[19:19] speed is estimated to require um eight
[19:23] H200 JPUs, which are most This is just
[19:25] highlighting the resources that are
[19:27] necessary. Um, $3 for just 8 seconds of
[19:31] service. VO3 approximately 50 cent per
[19:34] second of generator video that increases
[19:36] to 75 cents. So, this is where you can
[19:38] go in and do the calculation uh on how
[19:41] much it would be. I think I came up with
[19:43] you could do Avengers without all of the
[19:45] the actors um rights uh and without the
[19:51] editing and stuff the cost is just down
[19:55] 99.99%. Uh Micron, I specifically
[19:57] mentioned high band high bandwidth
[19:59] memory uh dramatically needed for things
[20:03] like V3. So when you go look at some of
[20:05] these high bandwidth memory stocks of
[20:06] which there's not a tremendous supply
[20:08] and these things have been a in a bare
[20:10] market mainly because of of smartphone
[20:12] sales and computer sales. Again I've
[20:15] said it before we are entering the world
[20:17] of hardware. This is a dramatic shift.
[20:19] You have time to invest in it and do
[20:20] your research. Uh but I would go spend
[20:23] the time and I would start with this uh
[20:25] interview which was a half hours with
[20:26] Alex Canerwitz with Demis and Sergey at
[20:29] the Google um after the Google uh event
[20:34] last week. So they had them both on
[20:35] there. A lot of good nuggets in there
[20:37] just in terms of where stuff is.
[20:38] Probably the most important question.
[20:40] They waited till the very end of this.
[20:41] Will AGI arrive before 2030? uh Sergey
[20:44] Brin I'm going to say before Demis Sabis
[20:47] just after this is why to even anything
[20:51] in your mind about what the world is
[20:52] going to look like 5 years from now when
[20:54] when you have two of the smartest people
[20:55] in the world that are directly involved
[20:58] uh with AI saying that within 5 years
[21:00] we're going to be at this point
[21:02] everything that you're doing and
[21:03] focusing on in terms of competition for
[21:05] a company or looking 5 years out the
[21:07] disruption is going to be unthinkable uh
[21:10] because by the time you get to AGI
[21:12] you've you've done things like the
[21:14] future of aging, extending healthy
[21:16] lifespan. This is a critical thing. Um I
[21:18] haven't done an extensive video on this
[21:21] yet. I've only written some minor paper,
[21:22] but this is just growing rapidly in
[21:25] terms of the discussion. But in this
[21:27] interview, he emphasized that one of the
[21:29] most important applications of AI is
[21:30] human health. Dario Modi has gone
[21:32] through this in his view curing all
[21:34] diseases
[21:36] uh uh might still not be enough to push
[21:40] people past 120. And that's because of
[21:43] systemic aging and central atrophy.
[21:45] That's what they're working on. And
[21:46] there's other things and other places.
[21:49] But they're all talking about massive
[21:52] extension of life within the next 5
[21:54] years and a change in health. So curing
[21:58] diseases, having people not get um
[22:01] obese, all these different things that
[22:04] are going to go through plus reversing
[22:06] aging. Uh, and this is the way that the
[22:08] deficit will eventually be taken care of
[22:10] because $3 trillion of the $6 trillion
[22:13] in spending is related to age and
[22:15] health. So, whenever you see people
[22:18] basically talk like this, um, Ben Hunt,
[22:21] who just seems to be pretty negative all
[22:23] the time, uh, it puts us on a path to a
[22:26] sovereign debt crisis. We are going to
[22:28] have rates going higher. We do have a
[22:30] problem for the next three years. I'm
[22:31] going to go through some of the issues
[22:33] that are going to continue to pop up,
[22:34] but I just want you to realize that when
[22:37] Alon Mus says this, he can't
[22:40] change what hap is happening in
[22:42] Washington. And as he gave up, Doge and
[22:45] he will do great work to propose the the
[22:47] day of
[22:48] bankruptcy. The only radical
[22:50] improvements in productivity can save
[22:52] the country. Um, accelerate GDP growth
[22:55] with humanoid robots. That's what's
[22:57] coming. Um, that's where it's going to
[22:58] be. That's why I wouldn't focus too much
[23:00] on things like Liz Truss's um except for
[23:03] trading elements, but I think if you're
[23:04] going to be bearish, you're going to
[23:05] miss what's happening with profit
[23:08] margins, which are going to accelerate
[23:09] from here, and that's where the boom's
[23:10] going to be. So, let's get into the
[23:11] negative story. Um, so Dario Modi gave
[23:15] an interview to Axios. He warns AI could
[23:18] eliminate half of all entry-level white
[23:20] collar jobs. And he gets more
[23:23] specific. Uh, starting to replace
[23:25] people. AI could wipe out half of all
[23:27] entry-level white and spike the
[23:29] unemployment rate to 10 to 20% in the
[23:31] next one to five years. Okay, that I no
[23:35] offense to Dario, he's a very smart um
[23:37] AGI guy and knows everything about
[23:38] what's going on. But in terms of talking
[23:41] about when the jobs will be lost and
[23:42] when a barber will be replaced and an
[23:44] acupuncturist and all the service-based
[23:46] jobs would make up the most of the jobs
[23:48] here, uh to get the unemployment rate to
[23:50] 10 to 20%, it's just not going to
[23:52] happen. Plus, he doesn't realize that
[23:53] we're losing 300,000 job uh 300,000 in
[23:56] the labor force pretty much every year
[23:58] now uh without having immigration to
[24:00] replace him, which won't be going on.
[24:02] So, I'll go through some of this because
[24:04] it doesn't mean that we're not going to
[24:05] have a weak labor market. It just means
[24:07] that the distribution of wealth problem
[24:09] is going to be the biggest problem.
[24:11] Miles Brundage, who was the chief AI
[24:13] researcher at OpenAI before he resigned,
[24:17] uh reiterates the same thing. by the end
[24:18] of 2027, almost every economically
[24:20] valuable task that can be done on a
[24:22] computer will be done more effectively
[24:24] and more cheaply by computers. He
[24:25] doesn't get specifically into the fact
[24:27] that they'll replace them. And that's
[24:29] because a lot of that has to do with
[24:30] adoption and these companies will just
[24:33] slowly go out of business, which is what
[24:35] has been happening. Microsoft laying off
[24:37] about 6,000 people or 3% of its
[24:39] workforce. Uh McKenzie cuts 10% of
[24:41] global
[24:44] workforce. Tech layoffs 2025. IBM lays
[24:47] off 8,000 employees as AI replaces their
[24:50] HR department. Salesforce says AI has
[24:52] reduced hiring of engineers and customer
[24:54] service workers. David Solomon, AI can
[24:57] draft now 95% of an S1 IPO prospect. You
[25:01] get the point. Um, we're at the point
[25:03] now with AI agents. The biggest
[25:05] companies that have the ability to do
[25:07] this not only will do it, they have been
[25:10] doing it. So, Torson Slock put this out.
[25:12] I disagree with his uh analysis and this
[25:15] is where again I just don't think people
[25:18] understand the AI side. So if you're an
[25:21] economist, if you're an analyst and
[25:23] you're 50 years old and you're not
[25:24] spending 80% of your time in
[25:26] understanding what AI is going to do,
[25:28] you cannot possibly have a view on
[25:31] anything going forward. I will reiterate
[25:34] it time and time again. This is not a
[25:36] technology. This is literally the
[25:38] internet or electricity coming in and we
[25:41] are just starting to plug into it now.
[25:44] So none of these companies have hired
[25:46] anyone over this period and the the he
[25:48] he was talking about the fact that this
[25:50] is an indication that higher rates are
[25:52] hurting their businesses uh which could
[25:54] not be further from the truth. Since
[25:56] chat GPT was launched which is here this
[25:59] is what's happened to the profit
[26:00] margins. they will continue to lay off
[26:02] people and find ways to be more
[26:05] efficient because these are the
[26:06] companies at the forefront of it that
[26:07] are able to use it right now and they
[26:09] have the capacity to do it. That thing I
[26:12] mentioned, if right now Disney could go
[26:14] buy all the capacity of Google, they
[26:16] could go make movies for next to
[26:17] nothing, but there's not enough capacity
[26:20] for V3. We don't have enough power yet.
[26:23] So that is the bottleneck in AI. That is
[26:24] the bottleneck in terms of what will
[26:26] prevent the situation that Dario
[26:29] mentioned which is all these jobs being
[26:31] lost. They cannot be lost without there
[26:33] being enough power to allow the capacity
[26:35] to be used and V3 is just another
[26:38] indication. But what is happening is the
[26:40] profit margins are growing for those
[26:42] companies for the overall market.
[26:44] They're still near the highs. So this is
[26:46] without the magnificent 7. They're still
[26:48] near the highs but again they're not the
[26:50] same. It's just not going in. So forward
[26:53] profit margins though in terms of the
[26:56] S&P looking forward going higher. Here's
[26:59] what's happened. So this is of the
[27:00] growth rate in earnings. Just look at
[27:02] this linear. They just continue to go
[27:05] higher constantly. The MAG 7 because of
[27:08] the efficiency side. This is their
[27:10] market cap. They're 30%. It looks
[27:11] concentrated. They're 55% of the
[27:14] earnings growth. So it's more than
[27:15] justified at this point. Here's the
[27:17] market cap of the Russell 2000. So think
[27:19] of these businesses as I showed you
[27:21] earlier. They're going out of business.
[27:23] How can a small cap business be able to
[27:26] survive when rates stay high? And the
[27:28] reason rates stay high is because of AI.
[27:30] We're not getting the deflationary
[27:32] benefits yet. All we're getting are the
[27:34] profit margin benefits at this point.
[27:36] we're firing people, but that the losses
[27:39] that go through the people or the lack
[27:40] of hiring that's happening, it just
[27:42] means it's putting pressure on wages,
[27:44] but the profit margins are benefiting
[27:46] the people that are retired at home and
[27:48] the people that are benefiting from the
[27:49] stock market as an investment, which is
[27:51] replacing the labor necessity. And
[27:54] that's where you get the distribution of
[27:55] wealth problem. That's why Donald Trump
[27:56] got elected. That's why the consumer
[27:58] confidence numbers are so low. AI is a
[28:00] very disruptive force. So now you have
[28:02] the market cap up at 17 trillion for
[28:04] those seven companies. Here's the market
[28:05] cap for the Russell for those 2,000
[28:08] companies. You're talking about 2.8
[28:11] trillion. These numbers were the same in
[28:13] 2015. This has been an acceleration that
[28:15] is dramatic. And here is where we got
[28:18] into chat GPT right here. AI is just
[28:20] starting to massively have an impact.
[28:22] And that's why the funding side of this,
[28:25] there's no way in my mind without a
[28:27] recession where the government says
[28:29] we're going to have ma help Main Street.
[28:31] We're going to move rates back down to
[28:32] zero. we're going to allow all these
[28:34] bankrupt companies to at least lower
[28:35] rates down. They don't have the money to
[28:38] spend on AI. They don't sur they can't
[28:40] survive with rates up at those levels.
[28:42] They're all it's just a gradual race to
[28:44] go out of business. And so this is a
[28:46] distribution of wealth problem. And it
[28:47] does show up in the numbers. So here's
[28:49] the unemployment rate which remains low
[28:50] for the reasons that I've mentioned,
[28:51] which is we have a flexible labor force.
[28:54] People can go out and get jobs. They can
[28:55] go to Door Dash. They're not out of
[28:57] work, but they don't like the work they
[28:59] have. They're not happy with it. And
[29:01] this white line here is the jobs hard to
[29:02] get versus jobs plentiful. So again,
[29:05] historically when this thing is going
[29:06] up, you're seeing the unemployment rate
[29:08] go higher, but this time it's not
[29:09] happening. And so I'm one of I've been
[29:12] saying this for a while that the jobs
[29:13] market is weak, but it's not going to
[29:16] lead to job losses. So here's the
[29:17] unemployment rate inverted. And now
[29:19] we've got it over the temp numbers.
[29:21] We've got it by the weekly hours, and
[29:24] we've got it by um the quits rate on all
[29:27] this stuff. So you're just at a
[29:30] situation where the labor market is weak
[29:32] and the way that it filters through is
[29:34] there's a massive redistribution or a
[29:36] massive distribution of wealth problem.
[29:38] And so where this all fits in is when
[29:41] you hear Tom Lee and he gets called a
[29:42] permable. If you've ever listened to
[29:44] what Tom Lee is talking about when he
[29:46] says S&P will afford to 15,000 by the
[29:48] end of the decade. He's specifically
[29:50] talking about AI. The prime age
[29:53] workforce is growing slower than the
[29:55] total population. And by the end of the
[29:57] decade, that gap is around 80 million
[29:59] workers. There's a labor shortage. And
[30:02] what we're doing is we're replacing the
[30:04] shortage with free labor. So it's a
[30:06] profit margin boom. Doesn't show up in
[30:09] GDP numbers. Companies will spend
[30:11] roughly 3.2 trillion per year on AI tech
[30:14] to address the growing labor shortage.
[30:16] So the expenditures are getting the
[30:17] profit margins and that's why he's
[30:19] positive on this. Now, this is the
[30:21] reason why we're both positive on
[30:23] Bitcoin. Because at the end, if the
[30:25] labor situation continues to
[30:27] deteriorate, where the median voter is
[30:29] angry and not able to move up a
[30:31] corporate ladder and they're under
[30:32] pressure, then the government, the
[30:34] easiest thing for them to do is to
[30:36] debase and print and we're going to see
[30:38] more of this. And so, he's bullish on
[30:40] Bitcoin. I'm bullish on Bitcoin. That's
[30:41] the reason why I wrote this on the
[30:43] collapse of patience.
[30:45] Um, again, this gets into longduration
[30:48] assets. It gets into the point of
[30:50] capital efficiency. It gets into a lot
[30:52] of different things, but it all ends up
[30:53] with Bitcoin. Uh we had the Bitcoin
[30:55] conference this week. So, as I've
[30:57] learned over the course of the last five
[30:58] years, whenever there's a big event,
[31:00] everyone tends to get long going into
[31:01] the event expecting there to be some
[31:03] kind of news. This time, Strategic
[31:05] Bitcoin Reserve, you had JD Van
[31:06] speaking, whatever the case is. And then
[31:08] you get kind of a a sell-off back to the
[31:10] prior uh area of where the strike prices
[31:13] are in the options, which is 105. Uh you
[31:16] also had this. I got four calls on this.
[31:18] For everyone out there who wants to uh
[31:21] panic over quantum computers breaking
[31:23] Bitcoin, I'm not going to go through
[31:24] this on these videos, but I will tell
[31:26] you just go download this Deote site and
[31:30] go learn something about this and then
[31:32] go listen to Peter Diamandis or go
[31:34] listen to anyone about when Quantum's
[31:35] going to be here and how they're going
[31:37] to have to deal with going through this.
[31:40] This is all clickbait stuff. This is all
[31:42] meant to get people freaked out. uh
[31:44] we're not there yet, first of all, and
[31:46] secondly, there are ways that you can
[31:47] personally just make sure that you don't
[31:48] ever have to worry about it. Um so,
[31:50] could it hurt people that are not paying
[31:52] attention? Sure. Could it hurt coins
[31:54] where people have lost them and their
[31:56] addresses are out there? Sure. But
[31:58] that's not the point that you guys
[31:59] should be worried about. You should be
[32:00] worried about your own uh savings. Uh
[32:03] so, the Bitcoin Vegas conference, 30,000
[32:05] attendees, will officially be the
[32:06] largest conference in history. I have no
[32:08] idea whether that's true or not, but I
[32:09] wanted to put it up there. Uh JD Vance
[32:11] spoke and gave a keynote speech in it.
[32:14] You can go watch that. Uh I thought this
[32:16] comment from Matt Seagull, it's the way
[32:18] I think of it. Um it's the reason why
[32:20] I'm doing this stuff and and trying to
[32:22] help people learn more about not only
[32:24] Bitcoin but AI and uh again for anyone
[32:27] out there who wants some kind of
[32:29] guidance on this stuff from an
[32:31] institutional basis. Uh, I've got a
[32:33] bunch of different business lines, but
[32:35] one of the thing I'm trying to do is
[32:36] help people make their business more
[32:37] efficient with very simple ways to use
[32:39] AI in it. Um, so you can all reach out
[32:41] whenever you want, but Bitcoin is a
[32:43] hurdle rate for innovation. For
[32:44] something that's going up, let's just
[32:47] say 50% a year. It's hard for you to
[32:49] find investments that can beat that. Uh,
[32:51] so make that the hurdle rate. Um,
[32:53] multiple large US banks are about to
[32:55] come onto the Bitcoin network, says
[32:58] PayPal, former PayPal president David
[33:00] Marcus.
[33:01] I mentioned bit bonds uh a couple weeks
[33:04] ago as a solution for the Treasury and I
[33:06] think something they will do uh and I'll
[33:09] guess before the end of the year this
[33:10] will start to be a story but now it's a
[33:13] story for New York. Mayor Adams at the
[33:16] Bitcoin event plans to issue a bit bond
[33:18] for New York. Again, a bit bond just
[33:21] means two things. One is you're tapping
[33:23] into the demand side what's out there
[33:25] for crypto and Bitcoin in particular.
[33:28] You've seen it with Michael Sailor.
[33:29] You've seen it with uh Caner. You've
[33:31] seen I can keep going on and on of
[33:33] everyone complaining about corporations
[33:34] doing it. It's just a matter of time
[33:36] where governments realize that hey, if I
[33:38] can issue a bond with a 1% coupon, take
[33:40] the extra proceeds from not having the
[33:42] higher coupon, go invest that in either
[33:45] Bitcoin or Bitcoin calls and give the
[33:47] buyer of the bonds a chance to make more
[33:50] than the four to 5% which is the
[33:52] debasement number. Let me invest it in
[33:54] something that can outperform it. You
[33:56] get my drift. I'm a structure product
[33:58] guy. This is a no-brainer. As far as I'm
[34:00] concerned, it's an easier way to give a
[34:02] principal protected note to someone who
[34:04] is in the bond side and would get
[34:06] through. I think you'd be able to sell
[34:07] it to a lot of different people where
[34:09] they would give up the 3% coupon to get
[34:11] a chance to have a double digit coupon.
[34:14] Uh Pakistan announces would be setting
[34:17] up a strategic Bitcoin reserve. So when
[34:19] you're going through the government
[34:20] holdings over time, the US is the
[34:22] largest, China second, United Kingdom,
[34:23] Bhutan, El Salvador, Ukraine, Germany.
[34:26] Most of these are from not from from
[34:29] countries buying it, but from countries
[34:31] that uh own it from taking it from
[34:34] criminals or whatever the case is. Uh
[34:37] it'll just continue to be there. Fast
[34:39] food giant Steak and Shake announced
[34:41] they're saving 50% in processing fees.
[34:43] So the by accepting Bitcoin payments,
[34:45] Bitcoin is faster than credit cards and
[34:48] they're saying it's helped their
[34:49] business in terms of being able to offer
[34:51] that. Florida introduces bill. This is a
[34:53] big thing to at least start thinking
[34:55] about not just for here but as we go
[34:58] through the year and we get through the
[34:59] stable coin act. The question is what
[35:02] does the government have in plans for
[35:03] Bitcoin? Removing capital gains tax on
[35:05] Bitcoin. This is something Cynthia Lumis
[35:08] has mentioned uh at least in terms of
[35:11] transactions. She's had a number that
[35:13] was small but regardless these are going
[35:15] to be stories for the for the rest of
[35:17] the year. the Trump administration acts
[35:19] as Biden barrier for crypto and 400,000.
[35:22] If just 1% of the 8 trillion in 401k
[35:24] funds flows into Bitcoin, that's 80
[35:26] billion of new demand. Uh again, you're
[35:29] allowing people to invest in it, to save
[35:31] in it. Um and just to finish up on
[35:34] tokenizations, there was a speech
[35:37] uh from Commissioner Hester Pierce uh
[35:41] earlier in the month on a creative and
[35:43] cooperative banking act. And I just want
[35:45] to mention this discuss the ongoing
[35:46] efforts to revise its approach to
[35:49] regulation focusing on the tokenization
[35:51] of traditional
[35:53] securities. Uh this approach aims to
[35:55] modernize recordkeeping and trading of
[35:57] securities by leveraging blockchain
[35:59] technology. And my home or where I grew
[36:02] up and where I live for a long time,
[36:04] Bergen County, New Jersey, to tokenize
[36:06] 250 billion in property deeds on
[36:07] Avalanche Blockchain. 5-year project
[36:09] will digitize 370,000 property deeds
[36:12] across New Jersey, most populous county.
[36:14] Um, the reason I keep bringing these up,
[36:16] guys, this isn't just Bitcoin as an
[36:17] investment. This isn't just micro
[36:19] strategy by it. This isn't just
[36:20] speculation. The technology and the
[36:22] innovation, whether it's stable coins
[36:24] some weeks or whether it's tokenization,
[36:26] they're all going in this direction. You
[36:28] can't avoid it. Bit bonds will be there
[36:29] by the end of the year. Continue to look
[36:31] at Bitcoin and continue to watch these
[36:32] videos. I'll see you guys next
