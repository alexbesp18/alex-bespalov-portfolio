--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] uh back for another week. And uh this
[00:04] week there's going to be a uh a theme uh
[00:07] that I'm going to kind of try to do at
[00:09] the very beginning because there's been
[00:11] uh a lot of uh observations I've had at
[00:13] at dinners over the past week. I had a
[00:15] dinner with just macro people, uh market
[00:19] people from Wall Street. I had one where
[00:21] it was uh about half macro, half crypto,
[00:26] and then I had another one that was
[00:27] pretty much all crypto. Uh and I'll get
[00:30] to why that's important. But I want to
[00:32] give you the observations. Uh we'll talk
[00:34] about the reason that this is important,
[00:37] which is I've said before, I'll say it
[00:39] again. It's the end of the world as we
[00:40] know it and people need to adapt. They
[00:42] need to adjust. Uh it's been going on
[00:44] for some time. I'm going to give a
[00:45] little bit of a history lesson here. And
[00:47] hopefully by the end of this, you'll get
[00:48] a sense as to how this has been
[00:50] happening. And uh thinking in a binary
[00:53] way right now is is is going to get you
[00:56] hurt in terms of the investment side.
[00:58] another week that felt like a year.
[01:00] Trump uses the bazooka, uh, the
[01:03] liquidity bazooka, which people now
[01:04] learn doesn't have to be money. If
[01:06] you've created the problem, then all you
[01:07] have to do is pretend like the problem
[01:09] is solved. Uh, and it scares the hell
[01:11] out of people. So, there's not much
[01:12] trading. Volumes are light. Uh, and
[01:14] we're we've bounced up significantly.
[01:16] So, you've killed everyone who got
[01:18] bearish and said it was the end of the
[01:20] world. Um, the people who are bullish,
[01:21] I'm sure at some point soon, uh, they'll
[01:24] feel something on the downside as well.
[01:25] So, we'll go through that. The White
[01:27] House got scared this week. Bare market
[01:29] rally crowd uh is not going to leave
[01:31] anytime soon. Um hard data is about to
[01:34] fall hard. Uh and why that's obvious.
[01:36] Bare market for approval ratings and uh
[01:40] investing for the new world. So, first
[01:43] thing I want to do is go back to my time
[01:44] in Brazil and just uh show you uh one of
[01:47] my favorite trips that I took. I spent
[01:49] the week in the Amazon uh while I was in
[01:51] Brazil in the '9s. And uh this was one
[01:54] of the coolest times taking a boat and
[01:56] going over where the
[01:57] Rioenegro and the
[01:59] Rio meet and how uh it's not binary in
[02:06] markets. But this is the way people are
[02:08] basically acting and we don't have one
[02:12] system that is going to fall apart. So
[02:15] the thing I want people to think about,
[02:17] it's the end of the world as we know it,
[02:18] but you don't just go from one side of
[02:20] the river to the other and have this
[02:23] dramatic shift. The rivers meet at some
[02:25] point and the systems run parallel like
[02:27] this, but eventually they turn into the
[02:29] Amazon and it's one colored river. So
[02:32] we're not at the point of two separate
[02:34] systems. These systems, uh, meaning the
[02:36] old monetary system and the new one
[02:38] that's coming, uh, they've been merging
[02:40] together for some time. So to get people
[02:43] to believe that because I'm literally
[02:44] sick of dealing with macro people who uh
[02:47] say Bitcoin is worthless and say they
[02:49] have nothing to do with it. This is not
[02:50] a Bitcoin episode. This is a digital
[02:53] economy verse industrial. So I want to
[02:55] first give everyone um a
[02:58] quote that Alan Tooffler uh is famous
[03:01] for and I'll just bring this down here
[03:03] so that people can see it. The
[03:04] illiterate of the 21st century, so now
[03:07] will not be those who cannot read and
[03:09] write, but those who cannot learn,
[03:10] unlearn, and relearn. That's the message
[03:12] of this week, which is uh going out to
[03:15] dinners and listening to people have
[03:17] binary harden ways. They're bearish all
[03:20] the time. They think gold is going to
[03:21] somehow another be used in Starbucks. Uh
[03:24] all of these people that you hear that
[03:26] you re you see on X. Uh basically,
[03:29] they're not worth listening to because
[03:30] they're never going to change their
[03:31] mind. So, how do you learn anything if
[03:33] you're not going to in the 21st century
[03:35] where you have access to AI at your
[03:38] fingertips where you can learn more,
[03:39] unlearn, and relearn? I wrote a paper
[03:42] called the art of unlearning back in
[03:43] 2016. And again, this was at a time when
[03:46] I was fixated on how the digital economy
[03:49] was destroying the concept of of uh
[03:52] recessions, destroying the concept of
[03:54] GDP as as a whole, and how we would
[03:56] eventually as as we got to exponential
[03:58] innovation hit what Alan Tooffler was
[04:01] writing about in the third wave. Third
[04:03] wave, a postindustrial era driven by
[04:06] information decentralization and
[04:08] customization. The new phase would
[04:09] dismantle mass production models,
[04:11] transform institutions like education
[04:13] and government, lead to a society
[04:15] centered around technology, digital
[04:17] communication, and flexible
[04:18] knowledgebased economies. Toofflur saw
[04:20] this shift not just as technological but
[04:23] deeply cultural and political warning
[04:25] that the resistance from the second
[04:27] wave, the second wave, the industrial
[04:29] revolution, the people you hear talk
[04:31] about things like the global reserve
[04:32] currency and all this stuff that was
[04:34] created during the industrial
[04:36] revolution. They would cause turbulence
[04:38] and societies adapted to the
[04:39] decentralized fastchanging thirdwave
[04:42] world. This was written the book the
[04:44] third wave in 1980.
[04:46] So this is only four years after the
[04:48] person personal computer and it's a
[04:50] decade before the internet. So again if
[04:53] you want to spend time learning on the
[04:55] macro side and actually see what the
[04:56] third wave is and what the new
[04:58] information age agent means uh means I
[05:00] would suggest going and spend time with
[05:02] Alan Tooffler. First thing hear a lot
[05:04] about gold right now. Here's gold since
[05:06] the great finan or since 2007 before the
[05:09] great financial crisis. This is it
[05:11] versus the S&P. So it finally took over.
[05:13] This is all normalized. So now gold has
[05:15] outperformed the fiat the best fiat
[05:17] asset. You have uh MSCI world x the US
[05:21] in here and you have the Barclay's egg.
[05:24] So basically every fiat currency every
[05:26] fiat asset now uh has gone and this is
[05:28] why people see what's happening. The
[05:30] fiat system the current system is
[05:32] breaking down and we're going back to in
[05:34] people's minds where we were before. So
[05:38] to give you the history of the first
[05:41] fiat system to not be gold backed. So
[05:45] this is where when you hear people talk
[05:47] about it, this is the learning lesson of
[05:49] just making sure that everyone who reads
[05:50] the paper and goes through this, we're
[05:51] heading back. We need to have gold.
[05:53] Everyone's racing for gold. That was the
[05:55] last system we were under. We had a
[05:57] global reserve currency. We had the
[05:59] dollar from the 40s into 1971. We had
[06:02] the British pound before that. They were
[06:04] all backed by gold. And that brought
[06:07] trust into the system. We broke away
[06:09] from that in 1971 and we created a new
[06:12] system, completely new experiment. And
[06:14] that new experiment was to try and just
[06:16] have a fiat currency, which again, the
[06:19] fact that people now view it as
[06:21] something they can trust. They can't
[06:22] trust Bitcoin, but they can trust a
[06:24] paper thing that's not backed by gold.
[06:25] Well, that switched in 1971. The system
[06:28] ran into trouble. 1985, we had the Plaza
[06:30] Court. In 19978, I was in Brazil. We had
[06:32] the Asian financial crisis. The Asian
[06:34] financial crisis led to all Asian
[06:38] countries realizing they needed more
[06:39] dollar reserves. They needed dollar
[06:41] reserves. So, think of that as gold
[06:42] because they never wanted to be in the
[06:44] situation again that they could be
[06:47] basically uh caused to go down by hedge
[06:50] funds. They started exporting more and
[06:52] bringing in dollars and that's why we
[06:54] are in this situation that we're in.
[06:57] This fiat system led to them going,
[06:59] we're going to hoard dollars and we're
[07:00] just going to export. we're not going to
[07:01] focus on consumption because we never
[07:03] want to be in a position again where we
[07:05] have this problem. That leads to 2008
[07:07] because they're buying all the bonds in
[07:09] the US. They're just buying and buying
[07:10] buying dollars. Anything outside of
[07:12] their countries is keeping rates at
[07:13] lower levels. No matter what's happening
[07:15] in the US, you can just continue to
[07:17] issue mortgages and they'll buy them.
[07:18] So, we get the great financial crisis.
[07:20] We get the printing press. The printing
[07:22] press leads to a tremendous amount of
[07:23] debt. We get 2020. We get more debt. We
[07:26] get Silicon Valley Bank. The fastest
[07:28] bank run in US history. 42 billion in
[07:30] deposits withdrawn in a single
[07:32] day. So now where are we? We've got a
[07:34] hundred trillion dollars of global debt.
[07:36] Over 60% of it dominated in dollars and
[07:39] 40% of that debt matures before the end
[07:42] of 2027. So the system is basically
[07:45] breaking down. And what has happened
[07:46] historically is you end up with a
[07:48] depression, defaults, war, revolution,
[07:52] and that's why macro people are bearish
[07:54] and you go back to the gold standard.
[07:56] That's not happening this time. uh US
[07:58] looks more like an emerging market every
[08:00] day. So again, you're starting to see
[08:01] where stocks, bonds, and and currencies
[08:04] are doing things they've never done
[08:05] before. The end of the global reserve
[08:07] currency with the dollar as it is there.
[08:10] It's not coming back ever again because
[08:12] it was only there since 1971 and trust
[08:15] has been broken. Uh this was an article
[08:17] in the FT this week basically saying
[08:18] that the financial market has become
[08:20] increasingly dependent on hedge funds
[08:22] employing high lever strategies, basis
[08:24] trades to prevent liquidity and support
[08:26] daily volumes. the bond market is over
[08:29] in terms of people trusting the US
[08:31] Treasury market. That is not coming back
[08:32] at the size of the debt. You can't go
[08:35] through it. Hedge funds are in there.
[08:37] And then we've got this being written by
[08:38] the guy who's been who wrote a paper
[08:41] about what we're going through now with
[08:42] the tariffs. He also wrote one on the
[08:44] Mara Lago accord. And just so people
[08:46] realize, basically saying that the US
[08:48] has to restructure the debt, also known
[08:50] as a default. So why would you trust the
[08:54] dollar ever again if you are China? If
[08:57] you're an Asian country for the allies
[08:59] that we had, the way that they handled
[09:01] the uh the tariffs, there's no trust
[09:03] that's coming back. So the system as far
[09:05] as the dollar being the element of trust
[09:08] that everyone jumps into, it's not
[09:09] coming back again. At the same time that
[09:12] this was going on, I want to go back to
[09:14] Alan Tooffler. The digital economy has
[09:16] been growing and it's been dominating
[09:17] the world since 1990 in terms of asset
[09:20] price moves. It's why the US, it's not
[09:22] the death of exceptionalism. The US
[09:23] dominated technology. This did not start
[09:26] in the last 15 years. The internet was
[09:28] the birth of the US outperforming the
[09:30] rest of the globe. Just go look at what
[09:32] the S&P 500 has done versus MSCI World X
[09:35] the US in local terms since 1990. This
[09:37] has been a US dominated asset move since
[09:41] the 19 uh90s. But in 1975, personal
[09:45] computer comes out. 1991, the birth of
[09:47] the internet. 2007 the smartphone era
[09:49] comes. 2008 the Bitcoin white paper
[09:52] comes during lack of trust in the
[09:54] banking system globally. 2008 we
[09:56] launched the app store. 2010 the cloud
[09:58] takes over. 2022 OpenAI releases Chat
[10:01] GPT. In 25 the US Congress passes the
[10:04] stable coin act providing the first
[10:06] clear regulatory framework for dollar
[10:08] backed digital assets. That's what's
[10:10] coming on right now with stable coins.
[10:12] So the reason I'm going through this in
[10:14] terms of this the digital economy and
[10:16] Bitcoin did not just happen. This has
[10:17] been going on now for some time. For
[10:19] macro people that say it's worthless,
[10:21] I'll take Mark Andre over day on
[10:23] everyone who hasn't spent the time to go
[10:25] listen to anything on it. So why Bitcoin
[10:27] matters by Mark Andre political idolist
[10:30] project visions of liberation revolution
[10:32] onto it. Establishment elites heap
[10:35] contempt and scorn on it. So this has
[10:37] been going on since the beginning.
[10:39] Eventually mainstream products,
[10:40] companies and industries emerge to
[10:42] commercialize. It becomes profound and
[10:45] later many people wonder why it's pro
[10:46] promise wasn't more obvious from the
[10:47] start. What technology am I talking
[10:49] about? Personal computers, the internet.
[10:51] No, I'm talking about Bitcoin. This is
[10:53] Mark Andre in 2014. Uh about four months
[10:56] later, he had this interview in this
[10:58] article in the Washington Post. In 2014,
[11:01] he said in 20 years, so we're now 11
[11:04] years from that interview. We'll talk
[11:05] about Bitcoin like we talk about the
[11:07] internet today. Again, I'm bringing this
[11:09] up because this has been happening. That
[11:11] river that you saw, we are about to
[11:13] merge the two systems. They've been
[11:15] running parallel just like what you saw
[11:17] with the two sides. The assets and the
[11:20] way to make money has all been on the
[11:21] digital economy. It has not been on the
[11:23] industrial economy. We know that if you
[11:24] go look at the price of Ford and you go
[11:26] look at the price of GM and you look at
[11:27] the price of GE going all the way back
[11:29] to 2007, you see what has happened. It's
[11:31] all been about technology and software
[11:33] and everything that has been dominated
[11:35] as US exceptionalism. It's really been
[11:37] the digital economy. So, Congress moves
[11:39] forwards on stable coin legislation, the
[11:42] digital asset uh teback presentation
[11:44] that I've referenced many many times.
[11:46] So, again, the governments are sitting
[11:48] there moving it towards stable coins.
[11:51] So, they're moving towards another
[11:52] system. The Treasury sat there and had
[11:55] this before Trump took over in terms of
[11:57] the Tback
[11:58] presentation. Different types of stable
[12:00] coins, fiat back one. So think about
[12:02] going from
[12:04] gold gold standard to fiat then fiat by
[12:08] itself and now we're talking about
[12:10] fiatbacked digital economy stable coins.
[12:14] So this is what's happening. There's no
[12:16] turning back. It's being supported. This
[12:19] is from Chris Dixon recently. The
[12:20] internet made information free and
[12:22] global. So why is it still hard and
[12:23] expensive to move money? You cannot walk
[12:26] into Starbucks and go pay with gold. You
[12:28] cannot move into go into Starbucks in uh
[12:32] New York City and go hand them euros and
[12:34] get coffee. What you can do is go in
[12:37] there with your phone and pay with
[12:38] stable coins. You can go in there and
[12:40] pay with a card. You can take your
[12:42] Bitcoin, transfer it into stable coins,
[12:44] transfer it into your card. You can
[12:45] already do that. So, anyone that says
[12:47] you can't use the money, go try to pay
[12:49] with your S&P 500 spiders. Go try to do
[12:51] this. The system is changing and it can
[12:53] already happen. Stable coins are
[12:55] WhatsApp moment for money transfer says
[12:57] A16Z. This is two weeks ago. I've said
[13:00] on this for the entire year beginning
[13:03] after uh Stripe purchase bridge that
[13:06] this is the beginning of the network
[13:07] effects from stable coins into Bitcoin
[13:11] and into everything that goes on in the
[13:13] digital ecosystem. China may shift from
[13:15] US treasuries towards gold Bitcoin.
[13:17] Black Rockck
[13:18] says digital yuan goes global. This was
[13:21] a tweet or a post in X this week
[13:25] basically talking about there's been no
[13:27] confirmation that this happened. Um but
[13:31] you have to read through the article and
[13:33] go see everything that went on. Um the
[13:35] Chinese are trying to get off the dollar
[13:36] as fast as possible and they're trying
[13:38] to lead the way the same way the US is
[13:40] on the payment system. China rolls out
[13:42] plan to promote its own payment system
[13:43] as US trade war
[13:45] simmers. China hasn't devalued. I've
[13:47] talked about this repeatedly. We're past
[13:49] the point of using the old method. If it
[13:52] was, if China was being under attack for
[13:54] tariffs, why aren't they devaluing?
[13:56] Well, they can't devalue. It doesn't
[13:58] really matter at this point. But in
[14:00] terms of like going floating a currency
[14:02] in the global financial system now
[14:03] dominated by the US means making a
[14:04] country's financial system more exposed
[14:06] to US actions. So this is the whole
[14:08] thing is that the US decided in 2022 to
[14:12] do something with the dollar as the
[14:15] global reserve currency. They weaponized
[14:17] it and immediately after that, as I
[14:19] showed in last week, in February of 22,
[14:21] Russia, we basically sanctioned them and
[14:23] every dollar asset they held was frozen.
[14:26] In China's case, they immediately said,
[14:28] "Okay, we have to go start buying more
[14:30] gold." And their gold purchases started
[14:32] going through the roof and their
[14:33] treasury sales accelerated. So, this
[14:35] wasn't something that just happened.
[14:37] This has been building up for some time.
[14:39] And remember, the Russian sanctions were
[14:41] not a Russia thing. This is this has
[14:42] been or was not a Trump thing. This was
[14:45] a Biden thing. This has been kind of the
[14:47] route that we've gone. It doesn't matter
[14:48] which side. It's the US and China. It's
[14:50] not just Donald Trump. So, the dollar
[14:53] this year, it's it's falling and
[14:55] everyone's talking about how it's
[14:56] collapsing and going through it. You can
[14:57] see that every currency in the world,
[14:59] it's going down against the majors. But
[15:02] guess what? Here it is. Here are the
[15:04] currencies versus the yuan. The yuan has
[15:06] fallen as much as the dollar because
[15:08] it's unchanged versus dollar because the
[15:10] two biggest countries in the world have
[15:12] a peg currency and there's no way the
[15:14] Chinese yuan becomes the reserve
[15:16] currency. So again, the world is looking
[15:18] for a solution to this problem. It's not
[15:21] just the US that has a deficit with
[15:23] China. Europe has a trade deficit with
[15:25] China that's been permanent as well. So
[15:27] the system needs to be reset. It needs
[15:29] to be changed. And every single person
[15:32] that continues to say that they've been
[15:34] saying that this is a scam. This is a
[15:36] bubble. This will end as worthless. And
[15:37] it's not just people that I go to dinner
[15:39] with. It is Warren Buffett. It was
[15:41] Charlie Munger. It is Jamie Diamond.
[15:42] They're all still saying the same thing.
[15:44] And yet at the end of this year, it will
[15:47] be the second biggest asset in the world
[15:48] behind gold. This is where the economy
[15:51] is going. That's the end of that part.
[15:54] When you're seeing stuff like this, this
[15:55] is three weeks in a row. the economists
[15:58] ruination day, the age of chaos, how a
[16:01] dollar crisis would unfold again. It's
[16:03] the end of the global reserve currency.
[16:05] You cannot go back. The bearish
[16:07] sentiment on how this is going to end.
[16:09] We're in the early stage of a bank run
[16:11] on the US. This is all
[16:12] BS. Uh it's not that people aren't going
[16:15] to move money out of the dollar, but
[16:16] again, you have to take the assets and
[16:18] you have to put them somewhere else. You
[16:20] have to invest in something. And yes,
[16:22] the ones that are uh attached to the
[16:24] government, the ones the government can
[16:26] move, they will put them in something.
[16:28] But if European stocks go down for the
[16:30] next five years and US stocks go up for
[16:32] the next five years, uh sorry, they will
[16:34] move money back in. So this is it's
[16:36] great that everyone's saying there's
[16:38] repatriation, the dollar weakening makes
[16:40] complete sense, but where you're going
[16:41] to put that money in terms of assets,
[16:44] that's something that's very different.
[16:45] So I'm going to put this up again as I
[16:47] go into the next thing. You're going to
[16:49] see this three times. You must learn,
[16:52] unlearn, and relearn at this point
[16:54] because the system has changed. And if
[16:56] you're not comfortable with the new
[16:57] system, that's fine. This gets into the
[16:59] binary nature of everyone. So, here's
[17:01] the S&P. I showed this uh after uh the
[17:05] fall when I got when I wrote a piece
[17:08] about the low most likely being in, or
[17:10] at least that was the point where I
[17:12] thought we'd start to see uh the
[17:15] riskreward shift dramatically and the
[17:16] administration need to respond. So that
[17:18] range there is still what I believe.
[17:20] Meaning here we are at around 4950 4900.
[17:24] Here we are up here at 5700. Um it's not
[17:28] binary anymore. We're in the midpoint.
[17:29] We already made back over 50% of the
[17:31] fall from the breakdown. Uh this is
[17:33] where we are currently. We actually got
[17:35] back where every sale made, this is the
[17:38] opening price after liberation day.
[17:40] Every sale made on the indices in most
[17:42] stocks is now a losing sale. So if you
[17:45] sold after the liberation day with all
[17:47] the tariffs and the fact that the
[17:48] tariffs are still on, there's just a
[17:50] pause on some of them, but China's one
[17:52] is bigger. So we still have the largest
[17:54] tariffs since uh the Great Depression
[17:57] and yet stocks have found a way to go
[17:58] higher. How is that possible? Um bullish
[18:01] and bearish. I I'm sick of this as well.
[18:04] Um everyone who's bullish and everyone
[18:06] who's bearish, that's not what this is.
[18:08] If you're going to make money for the
[18:09] next six months, my gut tells me you're
[18:11] going to have to trade the market.
[18:12] you're going to have to be bearish for
[18:13] weeks and then you're going to have to
[18:14] be bullish for weeks. So saying this a
[18:16] bare market rally or saying it's a uh a
[18:19] buy the dip bull market. I don't think
[18:21] either is right. I think we're the
[18:22] tariffs and the situation you cannot go
[18:24] backwards. So there is going to be
[18:26] massive change that's happening. I just
[18:28] think the thing that it should do is it
[18:31] should keep the multiple outside. So if
[18:32] right now what we've done is a reset in
[18:35] terms of positioning for asset
[18:37] allocators. Hedge funds have not reset.
[18:39] They're still very bearish and they have
[18:41] to make money. They have to do something
[18:43] before the end of the year. Uh, as a
[18:45] reminder, this is when I put this thing
[18:47] out on April 8th, the light at the end
[18:49] of the turbulence. And within there,
[18:50] what I said is that number one, it ranks
[18:53] as the fourth largest two-day decline in
[18:54] the S&P. And I go through the fact that
[18:56] in each of those prior instances, the
[18:58] market was higher three and six months
[18:59] later. And we're headed to that path.
[19:01] And I think that's going to happen. But
[19:03] what needed to happen is in each of
[19:05] those cases, we got assistance from the
[19:07] Fed or government. not the case now. But
[19:09] given this is self-inflicted, a let's
[19:12] just say a pivot is needed and Besset
[19:13] getting more involved to me looks like
[19:14] that pivot. That's what I wrote about.
[19:16] That's clearly what's happened. You
[19:17] can't even find Peter Navaro and Howard
[19:20] Lutnick at this point. They're not
[19:21] involved in it. You don't see them
[19:23] anymore. And I don't think you're going
[19:24] to see them anymore. Uh second
[19:26] derivative of policy, I've said uh at
[19:29] 22V in our meetings, but I've also said
[19:31] it on on these things just so people get
[19:33] it because people have asked. Second
[19:35] derivative is just the rate of change.
[19:37] So if everything is bad but it's less
[19:39] bad, that's good uh for markets because
[19:42] markets lead and so they're looking for
[19:44] things that's less bad. Now rate of
[19:45] change could get better for a little
[19:47] while and get worse. I don't think
[19:48] that's going to happen. I'm going to go
[19:49] through why. But right now it's being
[19:51] driven by a change. This will mark the
[19:54] lows in my opinion and the reason I
[19:56] thought this is one of the dumbest
[19:57] things I've seen. uh when Howard Lucknik
[19:59] got on TV on Sunday about the the the
[20:02] trade war and said the army of millions
[20:05] and millions of human beings screwing in
[20:07] little screws to make iPhones are coming
[20:08] to the US. That was pretty much when
[20:11] stupidity had reached its high and
[20:14] things needed to change and that's when
[20:16] uh as I said Navaro and Lutnik you're in
[20:18] the back seat Besson you're in the front
[20:19] seat let's figure out a way to to keep
[20:22] our tariffs but also not have the market
[20:23] collapse and everything fall apart.
[20:25] Charlie Gas Marino put it best at the
[20:28] end of this week. The White House is
[20:29] playing a spin game with trade, seeing
[20:30] how talks of progress move stocks. You
[20:33] know, Donald Trump loves this and this
[20:34] is what I said. He can just say anything
[20:36] and get a rally. Um it won't last
[20:38] forever. There needs to be deals, but
[20:40] I'm sure there will be deals because
[20:41] they realize you can't do this forever.
[20:43] Uh so they're going to be deals and when
[20:45] we get a deal, the market will go up.
[20:46] But since we've already had a rally, I
[20:48] don't think it's going to follow through
[20:49] other than short covering. Uh but again,
[20:51] as the longer this goes on this game,
[20:53] and the more that China and the US ease
[20:55] their situation, people will start
[20:57] looking past all the stuff that's going
[20:59] to be coming for the next two weeks,
[21:01] which is a lot of bad information on uh
[21:03] on the economy, some bad information on
[21:05] earnings, but since companies aren't
[21:07] giving guidance, everyone's going to
[21:08] start looking forward to what's
[21:10] happening after the summertime. We'll
[21:11] assume we'll have something set there.
[21:13] Uh Monday, so that was just a kind of a
[21:16] a what's been in the papers. Now to
[21:18] Monday. Monday was another panic day. So
[21:20] you had uh Trump threats to fire the Fed
[21:24] chair. Uh so everything was horrible. He
[21:28] blamed he's going to blame Pal for any
[21:29] downturn. So the markets down big. We
[21:31] head down to the lows. Trump warns the
[21:33] economy may slow if Fed doesn't cut
[21:35] rates. Uh and of course marking the lows
[21:37] again. CNBC has a market in turmoil.
[21:39] When you see this come on your screen,
[21:41] you buy the close every time. Trump
[21:44] calls CEO Brian Cornell's meeting with
[21:46] Trump about tariffs productive. So
[21:48] Monday, while the market is falling, um
[21:52] Target, Walmart, Home Depot, they're at
[21:55] the White House. It's it's very
[21:57] productive. CEOs of Walmart flat out
[21:59] told Trump prices will go up and shelves
[22:02] will be empty. Uh leaders of six
[22:04] automotive associations wrote a letter
[22:06] basically saying, uh we're already in
[22:09] trouble. Many are in distress. They'll
[22:11] face stoppages, layoffs, bankruptcies.
[22:14] If one supplier is disrupted, it could
[22:15] lead to a shutdown of the entire So the
[22:19] the intelligence of the tariffs without
[22:22] the without a lot of research on what
[22:24] would happen is starting to become in.
[22:25] So what happens the next day? Besson
[22:27] expects tariff standoff with China to
[22:29] deescalate.
[22:31] Uh this was at a dinner and Aean Javvers
[22:34] is kind of important but can we
[22:36] rebalance together? They have stifled
[22:37] the consumer economy favor manufacturing
[22:39] the identity would be less consumption
[22:41] for China. Somehow I could see a Ray
[22:43] Dalio essay on this like a big beautiful
[22:45] rebalancing. I've been talking about the
[22:48] the hope they had of a beautiful
[22:49] rebalancing, which they're now saying is
[22:52] what they want. The goal is not a hard
[22:53] break. We want to stay engaged, but it's
[22:54] got to be more fair. The way they
[22:56] handled this was just ridiculous. Um,
[22:59] but they want to do something with
[23:00] China. The problem is White House
[23:02] considers slashing China tariffs to
[23:03] deescalate the trade war. So, this whole
[23:06] thing goes on. Um, and part of the
[23:09] reason is if you look, I think I saw a
[23:11] number that container bookings between
[23:12] China and the US, and this is from two
[23:14] weeks ago, is down 64%. So the goal
[23:16] isn't to decouple. The goal isn't to
[23:18] decouple. Again, they're starting to
[23:20] worry because they're realizing that the
[23:22] economy is going to weaken. So they say
[23:24] there's talks going
[23:27] on. China says there's no talks going
[23:30] on. So this is the way the week ends. No
[23:33] one knows who to believe anything. This
[23:35] is insanity, but it's ridiculous. But it
[23:38] is why the system is ending because
[23:40] you're never going to get people to
[23:41] trust after this kind of chaos. The
[23:43] bearish sentiment has not changed at
[23:45] all. We are still at record highs and
[23:46] we've been sitting up here since March.
[23:49] So liquidation liber, you know,
[23:51] liberation day is in here. Sentiment has
[23:54] been negative for a long time. Whenever
[23:55] you have negative sentiment for a long
[23:57] time, you would expect it to start going
[23:58] higher. Here's the long short uh from
[24:01] Goldman in terms of their leverage. So
[24:03] gross leverage is still up. They hedged
[24:05] up their books, but net leverage is down
[24:07] and the long short ratio is down. So on
[24:09] the hedge fund side, we have it. On the
[24:11] systematic strategies, uh they're
[24:13] basically at the lowest level they can
[24:14] be. So as things move higher and as V
[24:17] comes down you'll start seeing things
[24:19] like there's 50 million to buy in a flat
[24:21] tape just because as the market goes
[24:23] higher all the selling that happened
[24:24] there hasn't been any buying. So one of
[24:27] the things that's happened and been a
[24:28] theme over the past really decade has
[24:30] been that markets go down there's a
[24:32] panic and then volume just stops and you
[24:33] know who keeps buying buybacks. And this
[24:36] other group that everyone says is really
[24:38] stupid retail. Retail's been buying
[24:40] every dip for the last decade. they
[24:43] continue to put it in and every macro
[24:44] person says, "I'm not going to get long
[24:46] until retail has capitulated." Um,
[24:49] retail doesn't have withdrawals. This is
[24:52] a rigged market. The government comes in
[24:54] and does what Trump is doing. Why
[24:55] wouldn't you be buying every time
[24:57] there's a big selloff of 20%. Because
[24:59] that seems to be the line in the sand as
[25:01] to where they're handing out free money.
[25:03] And people want to be philosophical and
[25:05] ideological about the views they've had
[25:07] for the last 15 years. They need to
[25:09] learn, they need to unlearn, and they
[25:11] need to stop with the side of uh saying
[25:14] they're not going to relearn anything.
[25:16] So, there was a thrust signal this week.
[25:18] I've shown these all the time. Another
[25:19] one that's gone up. So, it's not just
[25:21] been the sentiment. We're actually
[25:23] seeing days that are very, very severe
[25:25] on the upside. The down days, they get
[25:27] reversed now very quickly. The opposite
[25:29] of what was happening before.
[25:31] Economists, what a shock. Coin flip, do
[25:33] what you want with that. The market's
[25:34] already priced that in. Um the VIX,
[25:37] remember we got up to 60 and everyone
[25:38] was like the you're going to have a
[25:40] recession. We've had these, we've had
[25:41] these. Um now we've gone all the way
[25:43] back to 24. And during that entire
[25:46] period, there's been no layoffs. I've
[25:47] talked about this before. The job
[25:49] situation completely different than the
[25:51] prior ones. So every time we had these
[25:53] spikes before, the jobless claims never
[25:55] went higher because the job market has
[25:57] completely changed because of the
[25:59] digital economy. Again, people work from
[26:01] home. Contingent workforce makes up 30
[26:03] to 40% of the labor market. This
[26:05] includes consultants. This includes Door
[26:08] Dash drivers. This includes Uber
[26:10] drivers. If you lose your job, the
[26:11] reason you don't have to be on
[26:12] unemployment is because anyone can go
[26:14] out and be an Uber driver. Anyone can go
[26:16] out and be a Door Dash. Again, the
[26:18] economy has changed rapidly. Most of the
[26:20] jobs being created are health care and
[26:22] education, which are not cyclical. Plus,
[26:25] you have this thing that they can't be
[26:26] fired by our company because they don't
[26:28] work for them. Adapt.
[26:30] Adapt. Here's year-over-year S&P.
[26:34] So again, we got down here and I said,
[26:37] if we have a recession, we can do this.
[26:39] But this was the great financial crisis.
[26:41] This is when we had the birth of the
[26:43] printing press and the birth of the
[26:44] iPhone. This is when the digital economy
[26:46] became more of it. This is when we shut
[26:49] an economy down and people are still
[26:50] able to spend at home. Do you realize
[26:52] that if we shut had a pandemic here and
[26:54] we shut everything down, there was no
[26:56] Amazon back then. So there was no
[26:58] delivery of this. You could get books,
[27:00] but you couldn't get all the things that
[27:02] you need because the app store wasn't
[27:04] born until you got into here. So, the
[27:06] economyy's changed. The digital economy
[27:07] has been coming up, but people are still
[27:09] looking at this stuff telling the same
[27:10] story that they've told over and over.
[27:13] It is boring to listen to macro guys. It
[27:15] is boring to hear how bearish people get
[27:18] and how this is the end of the world and
[27:19] you can only buy gold. It is bearish. It
[27:21] is just a bore show to sit at a dinner
[27:24] table and listen to it. All right, Ryan
[27:26] Peterson. This is the bad news that's
[27:28] coming. If you haven't read this yet, I
[27:30] don't know what you're missing. This is
[27:31] the beauty of the information ages.
[27:34] Every single thing is known. So, yes, we
[27:36] have no ships coming in. Yes, they're
[27:38] not going to the ports. Yes, the soft
[27:41] data is still horrible. No one's doing
[27:44] anything. People are cancelling.
[27:45] Airflights, they're all down. The
[27:47] national economy in Beigebook largely
[27:49] unchanged. That's basically the same as
[27:50] saying there's a soft recession.
[27:52] Employment was mostly flat. Same thing
[27:54] as saying it's a soft recession. We have
[27:56] inflation still. Anyone's saying we're
[27:58] not going to have inflation. I showed LA
[27:59] last week we're going to have inflation.
[28:02] It's not going to last necessarily
[28:03] forever, but for the next three months,
[28:05] if we're not going to have anything
[28:06] coming in, we're going to have empty
[28:07] shelves. The prices are going to go
[28:09] higher. You're ahead inflation
[28:10] expectations. This is the Atlanta Fed
[28:13] going
[28:15] higher. Uh you've got other ones here.
[28:17] The red one here is you miss. This one
[28:19] is politically uh bastardized, so it
[28:21] doesn't really matter. But then you've
[28:22] got the New York Fed. You've got the
[28:24] Conference Board. We've got growth
[28:26] slowing. We have inflation going down.
[28:28] The Fed won't be able to cut
[28:30] rates. Bank. We still don't have
[28:32] liquidity. Deals aren't getting done.
[28:34] All of this at this point is known news.
[28:36] All of it. Here is what people may not
[28:39] know. Three new polls were just
[28:41] released. This is from uh Friday. And
[28:44] they're absolutely horrific. The only
[28:45] one I really care about is the Fox News
[28:47] poll. I'll leave all these out. So, here
[28:49] you got the Fox News one. I mean, he's
[28:52] losing on everything. The economy 38%
[28:54] approve. Donald Trump has a base of 40%.
[28:57] He he's actually lost two two% of the
[29:00] people two he's lost two two% in in his
[29:04] the tariffs. So at this point I I don't
[29:06] know how the midterms are going to go
[29:08] next year. So here's what the reality is
[29:10] now. We're going to shift into how you
[29:12] make money coming out of this because if
[29:14] we go sideways for the next five years,
[29:16] it would not surprise me. Um, I would
[29:18] not be surprised if five years from now
[29:20] that's the way we burn off this because
[29:22] as I've said, I believe AI is a
[29:24] completely disruptive force that also is
[29:26] going to impact where the multiple
[29:28] should be in the market, particularly in
[29:30] tech multiples. AI will disrupt all
[29:32] companies, every single one of them. And
[29:35] it's 50% tech. So AI to me is there. So
[29:38] I've never been positive on stocks. I
[29:40] don't care. I think we could be
[29:41] unchanged. I don't own any really except
[29:44] for one. uh and then a little bit of
[29:47] something uh on the uh the embodiment
[29:50] side, but Google came out and said
[29:52] they're still going to meet their capex
[29:53] target. How bad could things be if
[29:55] Google is saying they're going to still
[29:57] put in the 75 billion? So, what do we
[30:00] get? Socks over the NDX is what I want
[30:04] everyone to start focusing on because
[30:06] when we've had earnings revisions, and
[30:08] again, this is the earnings revision
[30:10] factor which gets really important to
[30:12] people being able to take risk. this
[30:14] thing needs to go higher. If this goes
[30:16] higher, historically it's happened
[30:18] because the socks has outperformed the
[30:19] NASDAQ and this is going back to 2012.
[30:22] So, I'd be watching the semis. Um,
[30:24] you've got DRAM memory that is expected
[30:26] to get a lot more expensive. Part of
[30:28] that is from the tariffs, but again,
[30:30] it's demand. They're out in many cases.
[30:33] So, the demand side even in this is
[30:36] going to happen because AI is a is a
[30:38] theme that is going to go on. uh Beth
[30:40] Kindig who's awesome
[30:43] uh Taiwan Semi is said to be
[30:45] implementing of a 30% uh hike as demand
[30:48] continues to outstrip supply you want to
[30:51] focus on areas where demand is
[30:52] outstripping supply. Okay, this is the
[30:54] final uh part of this video but one more
[31:00] time you got to learn you got to unlearn
[31:04] what you think you know especially gold
[31:06] back stuff and you got to relearn. So
[31:09] for the investment side, let's get back
[31:11] into it. A week after Liberation Day,
[31:15] there was a hearing in Washington titled
[31:19] Converting Energy into Intelligence: The
[31:21] Future of AI Technology, Human
[31:22] Discovery, and American Global
[31:24] Competitiveness. Uh it's four hours.
[31:27] It's online. You can go watch it. Eric
[31:29] Schmidt spoke at it. Um this was about
[31:32] the impact and the need for power. So
[31:36] you don't have to go watch it if you
[31:38] don't want but 22V research I did a
[31:41] 25page report electrify and amplify how
[31:45] bits and bites drive demand for watts
[31:46] and volts power power you need to have
[31:50] your portfolio more weighted towards
[31:52] power going forward so I'm giving you
[31:53] the ideas in my mind that when when we
[31:56] come out of this from when people are
[31:58] investing you want to go to the places
[32:00] that the government is supporting the
[32:02] government is going to make sure there's
[32:04] revenues going through uh they are doing
[32:06] things for financials in terms of
[32:08] deregulation. They're doing things for
[32:10] health care because the entitlements
[32:11] will continue to give people money. So
[32:13] the revenues are there and then you want
[32:15] to see what AI is doing. AI is driving
[32:17] power and the government knows that we
[32:18] need more power. So that's what Eric
[32:20] Schmidt was there for terms of the
[32:22] health care side and longevity side. Uh
[32:24] you had uh Deus from DeepMind the CEO
[32:27] basically said all diseases will be
[32:29] cured in about 10 years. Again this is
[32:31] not the industrial economy. This is
[32:33] something where you have to pay
[32:34] attention to what's going on in
[32:36] technology. Eric Schmidt had a uh
[32:38] YouTube is about 20 minutes. Ex Google
[32:40] CEO warning AI will be smarter and
[32:42] uncontrollable. He's giving an update on
[32:44] where we are with AGI and ASI and how
[32:46] it's going even faster. At the very end
[32:48] in terms of the final five minutes, he
[32:51] talked about an amazing thing in terms
[32:53] of the drug. So it actually started yeah
[32:55] about five minutes in what's going to
[32:57] happen in terms of allowing this. So the
[33:00] project that he's involved in aims to
[33:03] identify all druggable human biological
[33:05] targets within two years which could
[33:08] revalize pharma development. Think of it
[33:10] as every single drugable human bio
[33:12] biological target. So anything where
[33:15] drugs can work they will have solutions
[33:17] for and this again gets into how do you
[33:20] value what the market is. The one thing
[33:22] I won't say is if anything the the stock
[33:25] market to me will go higher in the next
[33:27] five years. But I could see it
[33:28] absolutely as being sideways because of
[33:30] the waitings in it at least for certain
[33:33] in the US. But I just want to make sure
[33:35] that you understand that we are entering
[33:37] a period right now with technology where
[33:39] AI is accelerating so fast that I think
[33:42] people are getting caught worrying about
[33:43] the global reserve currency where I'm
[33:45] telling you there's already a plan in
[33:46] place to to resolve it. What is an AI
[33:50] agent? This is a McKenzie report that
[33:51] came out on March 25th. Uh, highly
[33:54] recommend spending time on it. The AI
[33:56] agents are here. I wrote a paper on
[33:58] this. AI agents are here. Again, 22V
[34:00] research spending time on healthcare.
[34:03] Uh, what names and parts uh are there
[34:06] that you should be looking at. And then,
[34:08] uh, my buddy Anthony Pompiano, we do a
[34:11] weekly podcast together on the bridge
[34:13] between macro and and and crypto. Uh,
[34:16] for people to trying to learn each week.
[34:18] I would highly recommend spending time
[34:20] on it. We talk about a lot of the things
[34:21] going on, but Anthony had an interview
[34:23] with Chris Camilillo who is heavily into
[34:25] humanoid robots as an investor and he
[34:28] talked about him on there. He's been the
[34:29] best person I've heard give broad
[34:31] interviews. Uh so it was great that uh
[34:33] that Pomp had him on, but he talked
[34:35] about it. How do you value an infinite
[34:37] labor force? And this gets into I don't
[34:39] know. None of us know what it's going to
[34:40] look like going forward, but the
[34:42] question is how do you value it? How do
[34:44] you even think about the fact that we're
[34:46] going back to the gold standard? We're
[34:47] going to have humanoids, billions of
[34:48] them, within 20 years. So why in God's
[34:52] name would you think about what the
[34:53] world's going to look like that isn't
[34:54] the digital economy when everything is
[34:56] going to be run by artificial
[34:57] intelligence. So to go back to the gold
[34:59] standard makes no sense whatsoever or to
[35:01] believe that gold is going to be the
[35:03] best asset. You want to invest in things
[35:04] that are related to the system that's
[35:07] going to be here and what's going to be
[35:08] dominating. Everything's going to be
[35:10] about speed. Everything is going to be
[35:11] about longevity. Everything is going to
[35:12] be about artificial intelligence. Number
[35:15] one opportunity for humanoids. Guess
[35:16] where it's going? Health care. It's
[35:18] where we need it the most. And you know
[35:19] how we know that? Cuz we have a
[35:20] shortage. That's why we we still are
[35:21] hiring 40 to 80,000 health care jobs a
[35:25] month. Very hard to get negative jobs
[35:27] when there's no manufacturing jobs
[35:28] already in the country, which is why
[35:29] we're trying to bring manufacturing
[35:30] back. And at the same time, we have a
[35:33] shortage of health care because we have
[35:34] a problem with obesity and diabetes in
[35:36] the country. And we have the government
[35:38] which is subsidizing it. and they're
[35:40] going to continue to pay money, which
[35:41] means they're going to continue to print
[35:42] money, which means we're going to
[35:43] continue to have the government being a
[35:45] dominant part of the economy, which
[35:47] means nominal GDP will stay up. Uh, this
[35:50] is the most important arms race in
[35:51] decades. So, the thing about humanoids
[35:53] is they're part of this. And believe it
[35:55] or not, I didn't include this, rare
[35:57] earths were shut down and banned from
[36:00] China. They they process more than 90%
[36:03] of the raw earth material. So if you
[36:06] want to know one reason why there has to
[36:08] be a resolution to this for the people
[36:10] who don't think or like nope Chinese are
[36:12] going to invade and China basically runs
[36:15] our military to some degree because you
[36:17] can't have humanoids without rare earth
[36:20] material. You can't have iPhones. You
[36:23] can't have fighter jets. You can if you
[36:26] do it yourself but the problem is right
[36:27] now China has a dominance. So you'd have
[36:29] to wait four or five years in the US to
[36:30] get the manufacturing going. So there is
[36:32] a linkage in terms of rare earth and
[36:34] they put a ban on that right after
[36:36] liberation day. For those of you looking
[36:38] again I did I'm showing you the research
[36:40] that I've done on this. This was another
[36:42] 20page plus report on moving from
[36:44] software to embodied AI. Again the next
[36:47] phase of technology and where the
[36:49] investment is going to be. If we're
[36:51] going to have 20 billion robots in 20
[36:52] years, you can make a lot of money. And
[36:54] that was Chris Camilillo's point. He's
[36:55] made a lot of money his life. if he's in
[36:57] one of the market wizard books. And
[36:58] basically what would have said, I've
[36:59] never seen an opportunity this big
[37:01] sitting at this early a stage. The
[37:03] question is, how do you make the money
[37:04] on it? I go through the places in the
[37:06] marketplace and the names in particular
[37:08] that I think will benefit.
[37:10] Uh now we're going to get into the final
[37:12] part, Bitcoin. All right, here's Bitcoin
[37:15] versus the S&P back to 2010. So I'm just
[37:18] highlighting to you that for everyone
[37:20] who's been bearish that you've ever
[37:21] read, stop listening to the people who
[37:23] are bearish. If you bought Bitcoin and
[37:24] you sold the S&P, you've made a ton of
[37:27] money. If you bought Bitcoin and sold
[37:29] the NDX, you've made a ton of money. If
[37:30] you bought Bitcoin and sold gold, you've
[37:32] made a ton of money except for this
[37:35] little point here. And this is really
[37:37] the point where gold, because central
[37:39] banks should be buying gold because
[37:40] buying Bitcoin at this point is not
[37:42] something they do. They will eventually.
[37:44] Uh here's Bitcoin versus the Mag 7. This
[37:46] has been my theme for the entire year is
[37:48] that we're AI is disrupting the Mag 7.
[37:51] They're spending tons of money. They're
[37:52] never going to see the revenues come
[37:53] through. They were the last place that
[37:55] individual investors that are wealthy
[37:57] could invest to get growth. If the Mag
[37:59] 7's dead, everyone's going to have to go
[38:01] find the next growth opportunity. Uh my
[38:04] my 90-year-old stepfather got into
[38:06] Bitcoin a while ago. He's thankful. He
[38:09] also owns gold. I don't understand why
[38:10] people don't own gold and some Bitcoin,
[38:12] but I think the wealthy people will
[38:14] finally be coming because it will be
[38:16] working. And as I said on a uh a podcast
[38:18] this week, this will be like Donald
[38:20] Trump. You can ask a hundred people who
[38:22] voted for Donald Trump. You're not going
[38:23] to get the answers of the people all
[38:25] said. Some people don't want to say it.
[38:26] By the end of this year, people own
[38:27] Bitcoin. They'll never admit it if
[38:29] they've been bearish. And it may already
[38:30] be there. Uh since Liberation Day,
[38:34] Bitcoin is now the best performing
[38:35] asset. So, gold gets all the press. It's
[38:38] front page. It's up every single day.
[38:40] And yet, since Liberation Day, which was
[38:42] effectively the end of the global
[38:44] reserve currency, we've got stocks down.
[38:46] Uh but they're almost backed unchanged.
[38:48] This is both the MAG 7 and the S&P. Gold
[38:51] was working uh more than Bitcoin. But
[38:53] there was a change that happened which
[38:55] is why this is the focus for this week
[38:56] because I believe what has happened now
[38:59] is once the Treasury market became an
[39:01] issue which is what happened in here
[39:03] then all of a sudden the trust factor
[39:05] was gone and the official beginning of
[39:07] the new monetary system was here and
[39:09] that's where Bitcoin goes. I'm bringing
[39:10] this up because if you haven't read
[39:12] this, this is not just a Donald Trump
[39:14] thing, people. Harvard has liabilities.
[39:19] Any investor that has liabilities needs
[39:22] returns. You cannot get returns going
[39:24] forward, in my opinion, in the S&P 500
[39:26] to necessarily beat inflation. You
[39:29] cannot get them in bonds. You cannot get
[39:31] them in any asset class of size. I don't
[39:33] think you can get necessarily in private
[39:34] equity, and I don't think you can get it
[39:36] in private debt. If he's going to do
[39:37] these tariffs, we are going to see more
[39:38] bankruptcies. we are going to see more
[39:40] businesses go out and if you need to
[39:42] invest in something where are you going
[39:45] to get excess returns not on the hedge
[39:46] fund side so where are you going to get
[39:48] your excess returns where are you going
[39:50] to get liquidity which is the issue here
[39:52] they're selling something which has no
[39:54] liquidity bitcoin you can trade a
[39:56] billion dollars you can be traded on
[39:58] Sundays you can trade it on Saturdays
[39:59] you can trade it at any time of the day
[40:01] 247 365 days a year that's the new
[40:05] monetary system guys that's where we're
[40:07] headed towards uh And then we had this.
[40:10] So, we've got the government again
[40:11] continuing to get involved. It's not
[40:12] just Donald Trump that's kind of insider
[40:15] trading right now on Bitcoin with his uh
[40:18] son tweeting about buying it, him
[40:21] involved in trying to get it higher. And
[40:23] now you've got Caner doing something
[40:24] with SoftBank and Tether and
[40:27] Bitfinex to basically set up a large uh
[40:31] let's say micro strategy type
[40:34] investment. They'll be buying Bitcoin.
[40:37] You've obviously had other uh other uh
[40:39] companies doing it and the spa was up
[40:41] big on the back of it. So again, when
[40:44] it's working and people are doing it,
[40:46] you're going to get more people on very
[40:48] end more just there. Fed rolls back
[40:50] crypto warnings for Wall Street. This
[40:51] happened on Friday. It's not a complete
[40:53] win, but the banks are going to be doing
[40:56] stuff on crypto. Hm. A senator invest
[40:59] more in
[41:01] Bitcoin. Wow. announces that he's bought
[41:04] more as he's working on the bill. I I
[41:07] wonder if Bitcoin's actually already
[41:09] been decided as a reserve. I listened to
[41:12] an interview with Hamilton Lane again on
[41:14] Anthony Pompiano, uh who basically
[41:18] they're doing tokenized funds already.
[41:20] You'll start to learn a lot more about
[41:21] tokenization. The capital structure of
[41:23] the world is changing. So, not only is
[41:25] the global reserve currency changing,
[41:26] you have stable coins, you have Bitcoin,
[41:29] you have the blockchain, and you have
[41:31] tokenization. They are all lined up.
[41:33] Continue to try and learn guys about
[41:35] this because this is the way the world's
[41:37] going to work in terms of making money.
[41:38] Apollo unveils tokenized private credit
[41:40] fund. This will allow again individuals
[41:43] to buy private stuff even if it's only
[41:46] with 10 bucks. That's the beauty of
[41:48] having
[41:50] tokenization. And China rolls out $100
[41:53] million tokenized fund. It's not just
[41:56] the US, guys. It's China as well as the
[41:58] rest of the world. Here's the final
[42:00] part. Uh, believe it or not, if you like
[42:03] gold, uh, the best
[42:05] performing
[42:08] asset of size related to this whole
[42:11] conversation, Micro Strategy. So,
[42:13] everyone who's bearish on Micro
[42:14] Strategy, every single person who's at
[42:17] these dinners basically says, "I know
[42:20] this is a scam because of Michael
[42:21] Sailor. I'm a macro person. I consider
[42:24] myself reasonably learned. I've I've
[42:26] been trading macro for a long time. I
[42:29] consider and talk history and and assets
[42:31] with anybody. Uh Micro Strategy was up
[42:34] over 300% the last two years. Gold was
[42:36] not. It has now surpassed gold this
[42:38] year. So in terms of gold being the
[42:40] biggest asset, no. But there's no no
[42:42] charts out there Micro Strategy. So, the
[42:44] only person who seems to get what the
[42:46] new world is going to look like, who has
[42:48] a moat on the moat of currency and
[42:51] things going forward, where I call
[42:53] Bitcoin the S&P 500 of the future
[42:56] because of the disruption that is coming
[42:59] and the capital structure changing
[43:01] completely with no debt going forward
[43:04] and the capital structure will be
[43:05] different. It'll be built around Bitcoin
[43:06] and Michael Sailor basically has a moat
[43:09] on it and that's why there's a premium
[43:10] on his business. I'm going to finish it
[43:12] here. If you guys want to go learn, this
[43:14] is one of the podcasts I listen to with
[43:17] Michael Sailor. Four hours and two
[43:19] minutes. Listen to Alvin Tomler. Go out,
[43:22] learn, unlearn, relearn, do anything.
[43:26] Just don't go to these dinners and be
[43:28] bearish. Have a good weekend, guys. I
[43:30] see you next week.
