--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] summer in New York. Uh, Knicks move on.
[00:04] So, we got that. And then, as I wrote in
[00:07] my, uh, Substack this week and talked
[00:09] about with Anthony Pompiano, it's
[00:12] Kentucky Derby Saturday. So, I'm going
[00:14] to put this in before I go sit down and
[00:16] enjoy the race and
[00:18] uh, hopefully uh, make a little money.
[00:22] So, bare market rally continues. Um,
[00:25] most hated rally I think I've seen. um
[00:28] only because I haven't seen anyone that
[00:29] can possibly buy into it. Uh stocks
[00:33] rally, sentiment doesn't. That's
[00:35] basically what I'm talking about in
[00:37] terms of as I'll I'll go through it. Um
[00:40] for those of you who've known me a long
[00:41] time, I'm a huge uh believer in basian
[00:44] theory and using it for thinking about
[00:47] markets and the Kentucky Derby with my
[00:50] father is where we really developed kind
[00:52] of the thought process before I knew who
[00:54] Thomas Ba was. Uh if sentiment is
[00:57] bearish, uh the question everyone should
[00:58] be asking, who I asked on a trip to
[01:00] London this week, who do you think is
[01:01] buying, debt problem still exists. So
[01:03] regardless of what is going on, I I
[01:06] still believe that we've got a lot to
[01:08] this tariff story over the next few
[01:10] years, as I've talked about. Um a big
[01:13] week again in humanoids in terms of news
[01:16] stories and things in the front
[01:18] headline. And for all of you macro
[01:19] people who give up after the first third
[01:23] or half or twothirds even and don't
[01:25] spend time on the Bitcoin piece, uh you
[01:29] either start doing it now or you're
[01:30] going to be doing it before the end of
[01:31] the year because it will be the best
[01:33] performing asset. And I figure by the
[01:35] end of the year with the move I'm
[01:36] expecting now given everything that's
[01:38] happened and what's going on with stable
[01:40] coins and I'm going to introduce bit
[01:43] bonds today and people on the macro side
[01:45] should fast forward to that just to get
[01:47] a sense as to uh what I think is
[01:51] rumblings that to me are going to be
[01:53] real as time goes on whether or not they
[01:55] happen. So back to a chart I've shown a
[01:57] bunch of times. I expect the S&P to get
[01:59] back up to the red line which is we're
[02:01] almost there. It has the 200 day moving
[02:04] average. It also has the uh day of the
[02:06] election uh in terms of the high close
[02:08] the day before the election. So, I think
[02:10] we are going to run into resistance. I
[02:12] do think we're likely to have a
[02:13] pullback. But I want you to look at that
[02:14] chart. The reason I did such a long-term
[02:16] one was not just to get the 20 one highs
[02:18] in where we had bottomed, but also just
[02:22] look uh that don't look like no bare
[02:24] market rally to me. Uh that's a Vbottom.
[02:27] Uh so even though I think we're very
[02:29] likely going to pull back because no
[02:31] one's bought into it at this point and I
[02:33] think macro people for demark reasons
[02:35] and a whole bunch of reasons resistance
[02:36] up there are going to sell this but uh
[02:39] that does not look like a bare market
[02:41] rally to me. So when you hear this from
[02:42] people it made sense that it could be
[02:45] one uh as an Elliot wave person that we
[02:48] could be doing one more wave lower. It
[02:50] just doesn't look that way to me
[02:51] anymore. So for people that are saying
[02:53] it is and not adjusting, this is the
[02:55] first basian principle. Uh new
[02:58] information and no one wants to do it.
[03:00] So uh a bare market rally, you know,
[03:03] let's use this one as an example here.
[03:05] The MACD's we did go back in 22 and and
[03:07] and go down. This one just is much
[03:10] stronger than any of the stuff in here.
[03:12] These bounces, uh it's taken a while. We
[03:15] obviously almost finished up for April,
[03:17] but that's why this does not look to me
[03:19] like that from a breath perspective. Uh
[03:22] normally when you have a bare market
[03:23] rally, you're not gaining everyone in
[03:25] the healthcare, energy, staples,
[03:27] utilities, and they they had been doing
[03:29] well before the market peaked or even
[03:32] while the market was going down into
[03:34] liberation day. But this is from the
[03:36] lows. Uh every sector's up. You're up
[03:38] 12% off the lows. So when it fell 10%
[03:41] two days, we heard about it. It's
[03:42] rallied 12% in the
[03:44] back. And tech obviously uh led the way
[03:48] where it led down. This is the bare
[03:50] market rally that I hear most people
[03:52] when they reach out to me say, "Well,
[03:54] this is just like May of08." And I'm
[03:56] going to show you why it's not. The
[03:58] first one is again from an Elliot wave
[03:59] perspective, this is very much like
[04:01] salmon swimming upstream. And that's
[04:03] what the Elliot wave theory is for. This
[04:05] is impulsive. This is corrective. This
[04:07] is impulsive. We are not seeing those
[04:09] types of moves since the low. This has
[04:11] been a very impulsive move up. Uh, I've
[04:13] shown each week a variety of different
[04:16] things, but that's where people think
[04:17] Demarc is going to get people to sell
[04:19] it. Um, and like I said, I I think a lot
[04:21] of people are going to try selling it
[04:23] this week. Uh, claims, this is the main
[04:25] reason why, again, there's no recession.
[04:27] There's no signs of one. There's zero
[04:29] there. For everyone who wants to pretend
[04:31] that there is a recession or that there
[04:33] will be one, there just isn't. And I'll
[04:36] go through why more and more, but I just
[04:37] want to remind people in May of08, a
[04:40] bare market rally. Um, we had gone from,
[04:44] you know, 300,000 claims and trended
[04:46] higher consistently and we got all the
[04:49] way up to 370. This was the bare sterns
[04:53] situation in here. So, everyone thought
[04:55] in '08 having traded there, this
[04:57] continued to go higher. So, right off
[04:59] the bat, the claim situation's not
[05:01] there. Junk spreads the bigger thing. Uh
[05:03] again in ' 07 junk spreads started to
[05:06] move higher and they just consistently
[05:07] moved higher and again this is into May
[05:10] of08 you gotten up to spreads of
[05:14] 640 basis points from 200. Uh right now
[05:20] we've gone from 200 to 227 and the white
[05:23] line here is the triple C's versus high
[05:25] yield. There is nothing in credit. So
[05:28] forget just claims. There's nothing in
[05:30] credit to say that. What is unique is
[05:33] that the bearish sentiment doesn't
[05:35] budge. So the S&P has rallied. This is
[05:37] again the impulsive rally. Bare
[05:40] sentiment. This is the fiveweek average
[05:42] of the AI has not budged. Um I I I I
[05:47] don't even don't even know what to say.
[05:49] Here's the fiveweek average. We're at
[05:51] 57.7, the highest on record except for
[05:54] one one week in 90. So bearish sentiment
[05:58] has not changed, which is not normal.
[05:59] Here is the bearish sentiment. Again,
[06:01] these are inverted when they're down
[06:02] here with the S&P. This is the 2022
[06:05] period. It just followed with it. So
[06:07] think about it. We got a rally here.
[06:09] Well, obviously sentiment, you know,
[06:11] people started getting less bearish. It
[06:13] followed it every single time. Uh in
[06:17] 1990, exact same thing. So during that
[06:20] period that I showed the bearish
[06:21] sentiment when the stock market rallied
[06:22] the bearish sentiment actually got less.
[06:25] Most importantly for the May of08 crowd
[06:28] who keeps telling me that we only had
[06:30] 25% bears. We have 60% bears. So this is
[06:35] a very unique situation in sentiment.
[06:37] The other place where it's unique is
[06:39] that this would be the first time in you
[06:42] know 30 years where the amount of stocks
[06:46] above the 200 day moving average with
[06:48] inside the Russell 3000 which was below
[06:51] 15%. So times below 15 where then we get
[06:54] back up to 30. The only time where we
[06:57] went back down here and made new lows
[07:00] was in this period in09 the great
[07:02] financial crisis. And so this is bare
[07:04] sterns. We go up and then we come back
[07:05] down. For this to happen again, we need
[07:07] to lose millions of jobs in my opinion.
[07:09] We need to have a credit contagion.
[07:11] Those don't exist anymore in this day
[07:12] and age. There are no such things as
[07:14] recessions anymore. So, everyone who
[07:15] wants to keep playing this game. If he
[07:18] keeps the tariffs at 145%, I still don't
[07:20] believe we'll have a recession. Uh I do
[07:23] believe we'll have lots of bankruptcies.
[07:24] I do believe the government will have to
[07:26] get involved. But you are making so many
[07:28] assumptions to get to recession uh that
[07:30] for everyone that I've seen and everyone
[07:32] that's talked about it, it's just it's
[07:33] just not real in this day. And I won't
[07:35] continue to go through all the
[07:37] structural differences that have
[07:38] occurred. Uh some of them will show up.
[07:40] Soft data versus hard data. Um this is
[07:43] going to get into do you really think
[07:45] getting into a recession is on the front
[07:47] page of the paper. Um when it's on the
[07:50] front page of the paper, meaning
[07:51] everyone knows the hard data is good and
[07:53] the soft data is bad. soft that again
[07:55] for people watching for the first time
[07:57] that just means people are worried if
[07:59] the tariffs continue to go the other
[08:01] direction second derivative policy
[08:02] continues to ease which has been
[08:04] happening people will get less every
[08:07] single time worried and as they get less
[08:09] worried they will realize that they
[08:11] don't have any skin in the game at that
[08:13] point uh at least on the hedge fund side
[08:15] but also in other parts businesses stuff
[08:16] people are just worried right now
[08:17] because they don't know what's going to
[08:18] happen so the uncertainty index I
[08:20] brought this up because will Trump
[08:22] tariffs spur a recession four chief
[08:24] economist weigh in. In all of my days,
[08:26] no one has predicted a recession a hair
[08:28] of where it's going to go. Economists do
[08:29] not predict recessions. They That's why
[08:31] they're all at 50. But we're been
[08:33] talking about it now for weeks. So, if
[08:35] people think it's not built into prices,
[08:37] I don't know where everyone thought it
[08:39] would be that easy. You could just read
[08:40] the paper and do what it says. Empty
[08:42] shelves and layoffs. I've heard this
[08:44] 12,000 times. Uh Basian thing. Critical
[08:47] thinking is an active and ongoing
[08:48] process. It requires that we all think
[08:50] like basians updating our knowledge as
[08:52] new information comes
[08:54] in. Trump announces 90-day pause on
[08:57] reciprocal tariffs with exception of
[08:59] China. Basian principle. This was April
[09:02] 9th. Basically the lows he pauses the
[09:05] market rallies. This is after every day.
[09:09] Didn't care about the stock market.
[09:10] Didn't care about anything. We need
[09:12] pain. First move the other direction.
[09:14] And people are still as bearish as they
[09:16] were then. This comes out this week. I
[09:19] would be surprised. This is the
[09:20] architect of this whole plan. I would be
[09:22] surprised if tariffs don't change in a
[09:24] few weeks. It has been clear there will
[09:26] be a deal with China. I don't know how
[09:29] Steven Marin does not have the the
[09:30] ability to go out there and speak for
[09:32] himself. So, this is from again the
[09:34] White House. Now, again, it is rhetoric,
[09:36] but I think again it shows that they're
[09:39] not setting the market up for
[09:40] disappointment. There is going to be
[09:41] something that goes on and every day
[09:43] there's a little bit more moving in that
[09:45] direction. In terms of job losses, we
[09:48] got the payroll number again for people
[09:50] betting that we're going to have a
[09:52] double dip in the S&P and we're going to
[09:53] head down. This is what needs to happen.
[09:56] This is 0102. There are no recessions
[09:59] since the point that I said the entire
[10:01] economy has changed because of the
[10:03] iPhone, because of the baby boomers
[10:05] retiring and the transfer payments now
[10:07] becoming 15% of nominal GDP, handouts,
[10:11] UBI given out to people, the
[10:13] distribution of wealth. We've had a
[10:14] massive stock market gain. So the wealth
[10:16] just are are basically driving
[10:18] consumption along with the UBI side and
[10:21] as I go through this you have business
[10:22] investment which is coming. We will have
[10:24] a slowdown in growth but to get into
[10:26] here you're making a huge huge leap
[10:29] which doesn't exist anymore when you
[10:31] throw in the contingency workers. Uh I
[10:33] will continue to say whenever a
[10:35] recession has been built up to 50% the
[10:38] one thing you want to do is buy by buy
[10:40] by
[10:41] by this is what Nick Timosro put out and
[10:43] again I've shown this before. I only use
[10:45] the aggregate number. So he's using the
[10:47] aggregate weekly numbers. And the reason
[10:49] this is important is because it does
[10:51] include the other components of the
[10:53] weekly hours which have been weaker and
[10:55] the wages which are coming down. But
[10:57] it's going sideways exactly where it
[10:59] was. And this is overlaid now with
[11:01] nominal GDP. You cannot have a recession
[11:04] without people losing jobs when we have
[11:06] this wealthy of it an economy. It's just
[11:09] not possible since 70% of consumption or
[11:12] 70% of GDP is coming from consumption
[11:15] and consumption needs job losses to
[11:18] actually have a recession. I was brought
[11:21] this was brought up to me a lot. I want
[11:22] to just address this finally every time
[11:25] one of these surveys comes out and
[11:26] people sends it my way. Look, there's no
[11:28] capex guys. Please, small businesses are
[11:32] not driving this economy. There are
[11:34] seven companies which make up the
[11:36] majority of the revenues of the of the
[11:40] country and they have tons of cash. They
[11:42] are spending money and they are the ones
[11:44] driving. So if only seven companies do
[11:47] not change their capex attention. Uh BCA
[11:49] research which I've loved over time the
[11:51] people that do this work they are just
[11:53] bearish bearish bearish. The reality is
[11:56] to use these diffusion surveys. It's not
[11:59] just soft data. You could have 70
[12:02] businesses say they're going to cut
[12:03] capex, but if you have a massive
[12:06] distribution of wealth problem, if you
[12:08] have the Russell 2000 total market cap
[12:11] be smaller than Apple by almost 2 to
[12:14] one, what is the purpose of diffusion
[12:17] indices? That is why we are in this
[12:18] trouble with the tariffs. That's why
[12:20] Donald Trump got elected because the
[12:22] majority of people are not participating
[12:23] in the economy. This is just logic. This
[12:26] is not something intelligent. This just
[12:28] means that you can't use these surveys
[12:30] to forecast doom and gloom. So let's go
[12:32] to more basian principles. Every single
[12:35] time someone writes a negative story on
[12:36] on Microsoft, go use semi analysis and
[12:39] don't use the sellside places that have
[12:41] sat there every single time doing the
[12:43] exact same thing on Microsoft isn't
[12:45] spending on data centers. Go look at
[12:47] what's actually happening. This is where
[12:49] social media ends up being a huge
[12:51] negative. People have so much
[12:53] information coming in. I don't even
[12:54] think they do their homework on this
[12:55] stuff. So what happens? Microsoft
[12:57] basically says in their earnings return
[13:00] demand is growing faster than supply. It
[13:02] accelerated in the quarter. Expect
[13:04] capacity constraints post June trying to
[13:06] get more data center capacity online to
[13:08] satisfy demand. This is from Satcha
[13:10] Nadella. The people who put out the
[13:12] bearish thing that you believed in it.
[13:13] They don't turn around and then say,
[13:15] "Hey, I was completely wrong. What
[13:16] happens with Meta? We anticipate our
[13:18] full year 2025 capital expenditures.
[13:20] We're raising it to 72 billion."
[13:25] Metal also said there's a compute
[13:27] shortage even with the capex guide up.
[13:29] So even the capacity we're bringing
[13:30] online, we're having a hard time meeting
[13:32] the demand. I've gone through this every
[13:33] single week in terms of insatiable
[13:35] demand for it. Deepseek didn't do it. So
[13:38] think about when this whole thing
[13:40] started. It started with DeepSeek. So
[13:42] everyone has become bearish and now
[13:44] they're ignoring the fact that
[13:45] everything being announced by these
[13:47] people is just not true. Google
[13:49] reaffirms its capex. So forget the
[13:51] earnings side at this point. just go
[13:53] through Morgan Stanley turned negative
[13:55] after the deepseek on the entire semi
[13:57] side. So when they come out and they
[13:59] boost fiscal year 27
[14:02] revenue because inference demands
[14:04] exploding. I've covered inference here.
[14:06] I did it on the embodiment research I
[14:08] did for
[14:10] 22varch.com. Their revenue they're now
[14:12] saying is going to be up 10 10% higher.
[14:14] Now again this is fiscal year 27 but
[14:16] inference is exploding on the demand
[14:19] side. It takes more compute. So now I
[14:22] just want to go back through the
[14:23] earnings and make sure that you guys get
[14:25] this because this fits in with the
[14:26] basian side. It fits in with the
[14:28] economic side for forecasting a GDP.
[14:31] Walmart here's their quarterly revenues.
[14:34] This is Amazon now. So again, Amazon
[14:37] surpassed just now. But I want you to
[14:39] see back when the great financial crisis
[14:41] happened. This is how the economy has
[14:44] changed. This is how everything in the
[14:47] market has changed completely. Apple's
[14:50] revenue were 25 billion. Here's their
[14:53] revenue estimate for this year after the
[14:55] end. 413 billion. So Amazon was at a
[14:59] point where that's about 400 or more
[15:01] than 400. Yeah, it's four about 400
[15:03] billion annual. This is 400 billion. So
[15:05] you're up at 800 billion in revenues
[15:06] from those two companies. Microsoft 300
[15:09] billion. Look where they were back in '
[15:11] 07 58. Go try to find companies that
[15:13] have had anything. These are numbers
[15:15] that are just massive. They're bigger
[15:17] than most companies. In fact, if you
[15:20] take Google's right now, the largest
[15:22] market cap in Europe is not as big as
[15:24] the revenues that are created by Google,
[15:26] Apple and Amazon at this point. So
[15:29] again, the economy has changed globally
[15:31] and it's not something about US
[15:32] exceptionalism. Those companies have
[15:34] dominated and they just reported and
[15:36] nothing is collapsing and they are still
[15:38] spending the money on capex. So you have
[15:40] to make an adjustment. Now where does
[15:42] this show up in fixed investments? So
[15:44] this is the GDP number down 30 basis
[15:46] points. Oh, must be a recession.
[15:48] Personal consumption 1.21 and this was a
[15:51] decrease. So, normally, I mean, this is
[15:54] this is something that's down. We're
[15:56] going to stay on the consumption side
[15:57] until people lose. So, you're going to
[15:59] get that as a positive. Inventories are
[16:01] obviously going to change because we did
[16:03] a front-loading of inventory. So, that's
[16:05] why this went up. At the same time, net
[16:07] exports collapsed because we did
[16:08] imports. So, you get this offset there.
[16:10] Government spending, believe it or not,
[16:12] was negative. So, we're actually getting
[16:13] a negative side from here. Look at where
[16:15] government was. Look at where it
[16:17] normally is positive. So we are getting
[16:18] the negative side. The problem is fixed
[16:21] investment was massive. What is fixed
[16:24] investment? Well, a bulk of that is the
[16:27] AI capex. That's where it goes in. And
[16:29] that's where you're starting to show the
[16:30] number. So the problem is when you try
[16:32] to do this, if they spend $300 billion,
[16:35] if nominal GDP this year grows 4%,
[16:38] that's $1.2 2 trillion of which 25% you
[16:42] have now been told by these companies
[16:45] that they will spend at least that much
[16:47] this year and they're running into
[16:49] shortages already. So how do you fade
[16:52] the economy when the without job losses?
[16:54] So again I'll keep saying it between AI
[16:57] and consumer you cannot have a recession
[17:00] that matters. So just keep going through
[17:02] and just keep looking at the job
[17:03] lossless claims. If they start to go
[17:04] higher we're in there. In terms of the
[17:06] austerity stuff, this is not something.
[17:08] So, we were all worried. Steve Cohen
[17:10] gave a presentation was very timely in
[17:13] terms of this is going to be austerity.
[17:15] Well, here were the bets on federal
[17:16] spending cuts. Doge back then 250 bill
[17:19] 250 billion. Uh what are they going to
[17:22] do this? We're down now to 3% on the
[17:25] betting polls or 10%. We're up at 40%.
[17:28] So, we we don't turn that as a positive.
[17:31] There's going to be less austerity. And
[17:33] to show it again, this guy does really
[17:34] good work on the accounting side and
[17:36] basically brings up the fact that we're
[17:39] not cutting anything. I mean, when you
[17:41] go through this as of right now with
[17:43] what's happened and what the fight
[17:44] they're having and trying to get a bill
[17:46] through, there's no spending cuts that
[17:48] are happening. So, the fiscal side, the
[17:50] fiscal deficit, which we had heard they
[17:52] were going to work on, that's not
[17:54] happening. We've got rates higher. So,
[17:55] they're kind of screwed in terms of
[17:57] doing anything. Everything has changed.
[17:59] You have to take a basian philosophy and
[18:01] adjust to the new data. And the new data
[18:03] relative to where it was before the
[18:04] market fell has all softened. It's all
[18:07] gotten better or it all hasn't turned to
[18:09] the abyss. So if we get deal
[18:11] announcements and we get something with
[18:13] China that leads to some reduction in
[18:16] the 145, everything is going to be very
[18:19] different and that's why the market has
[18:20] rallied. It's looking towards the second
[18:22] half because the probability of all
[18:23] these things have changed. In the spirit
[18:25] of the Kentucky Derby, that's the way I
[18:26] was changed. When the odds are changing
[18:29] because a horse had something happen or
[18:31] the betting pool goes through, you start
[18:33] trying to reassess what you think. And
[18:35] in this case, people are not
[18:36] reassessing. I hear the same things I
[18:38] heard before the market fell 10%.
[18:40] Nothing mattered in terms of price. And
[18:42] now we're back up to those levels.
[18:43] Earnings growth for the first quarter
[18:46] 12.8% at this point year-over-year. I
[18:49] mean so that means that as of right now
[18:52] uh the PE and everything about it just
[18:55] continues to get lower profit margins
[18:58] pretty much every single sector again AI
[19:00] agents is a story it's going to remain a
[19:02] story you're fading profit margins uh
[19:05] even in this environment they keep
[19:06] getting better here are the earnings
[19:08] again for Q1 for Q2 down and then still
[19:12] going higher year-over-year still going
[19:14] higher in terms of the forecast so if
[19:17] those are right then the market should
[19:19] go higher. Here are the estimate
[19:20] revisions which have come down. A lot of
[19:22] this by the way now is also due to
[19:24] energy because the oil price has fallen
[19:26] so sharply. So a lot of the revisions
[19:28] that have happened that have skewed
[19:30] things for the past couple weeks have
[19:31] been drawn by that. I just want to bring
[19:33] this up because as long as the earnings
[19:34] are growing and profit margins remain
[19:36] steady. You all hear pees. Um I I for
[19:41] those of you who've heard me speak on
[19:42] crypto, I I I don't believe any company
[19:45] has a value uh five years from now
[19:47] because of AI. I think it's so murky
[19:49] that all pees are ridiculous across the
[19:52] globe go through. I think commodities
[19:54] and things that are hard have a have a
[19:56] good side, but anything related to
[19:58] software, anything can be disrupted by
[20:00] AI. I don't know how you value them out
[20:01] three years. So all of their PE should
[20:03] soften, but it should happen when the
[20:05] growth rate goes down. So, I would start
[20:07] using PEG ratios for the S&P 500 as a
[20:10] better gauge. And right now, the PEG
[20:11] ratio relative to history right in the
[20:13] middle of it. So, I I really don't think
[20:15] the market in any way, shape, or form,
[20:17] the way I'm looking at it, is in uh is
[20:20] overvalued. Um, now we're going to segue
[20:22] into something important. And I mean,
[20:25] again, the market fell. You try to
[20:28] figure out who's buying. Apple announces
[20:30] a $100 billion buyback.
[20:36] Just hard to fathom how big that is.
[20:37] Larger than the market caps of 406
[20:40] companies in the S&P 500. So again,
[20:42] let's assume all 406 companies, that's
[20:45] their market cap. Say the economy is is
[20:48] bad, but Apple has enough money to buy a
[20:50] hundred billion dollar buybacks, bigger
[20:52] than 46. The biggest company in Europe
[20:54] is less than 400 billion. I mean, they
[20:57] could literally buy Nike, Starbucks, or
[20:58] Door Dash and still have over 10 billion
[21:00] cash and still buy back their own stock.
[21:02] You're you're just getting to the point
[21:03] where these numbers are are ridiculous.
[21:05] So, you need the Mag 7 to be the problem
[21:07] and that's what they've been because the
[21:08] S&P X the Mag 7 is up for the year. The
[21:11] rest of the world is up for the year.
[21:12] So, it's a bull market everywhere except
[21:14] for the Mag 7 at this point and they
[21:16] just reported earnings and everything is
[21:18] fine. And in Apple's case, they had the
[21:20] worst stock reaction, but they're buying
[21:21] back tons of stock. It's not just them
[21:23] though. You're fighting this. This is
[21:25] what's buying. having worked at Morgan
[21:27] Stanley and knowing that the buybacks
[21:30] keep coming and they love to buy on down
[21:32] days. They love to put their order when
[21:34] the market opens down. Which means all
[21:37] of those times where the market closed
[21:39] above the halfway point or at the highs
[21:41] of the day, which has been the majority
[21:42] of the days since the lows, we opened
[21:45] down, the buybacks come in. We're
[21:48] talking about a trillion dollars of
[21:49] buybacks. So, the volumes have come
[21:51] down. The fact that we went all the way
[21:53] back up to where we did on no volume and
[21:55] it took an enormous amount of volume or
[21:57] energy to get us down just shows that
[22:00] the path of lease resistance regardless
[22:02] of what people think is higher. Buybacks
[22:05] are real and hedge funds will turn
[22:07] around and buy once the news gets them
[22:10] off of worrying so much. Buybacks
[22:13] accelerated week over week and tracking
[22:15] above seasonal levels for the fourth in
[22:16] fourth week in a row.
[22:18] Um retail's been buying. I'm sick of
[22:21] hearing from people that retail is
[22:22] stupid. Retails does this and has been
[22:24] doing this. They've been buying s uh
[22:26] zero date options. I will keep saying
[22:28] the same thing I've said. You're missing
[22:30] the point on retail. They are gamblers.
[22:34] And what do gamblers do? They look for
[22:35] situations where they can make money.
[22:37] This is like card counting, guys. The
[22:39] S&P 500 has been up 85% of the time
[22:42] during their gambling time. Maybe
[22:44] someday it'll go down, but the reality
[22:46] is they buy, it falls, they buy, it
[22:49] falls, they buy, and yes, they keep
[22:51] buying. It's the way that the market has
[22:54] been, and it's the gambling nature, but
[22:55] it has paid off. And true gamblers know
[22:58] they're going to lose. It becomes a
[23:00] volume game. And if you find anything
[23:02] where you have an edge of 85% over the
[23:05] long hall, you just keep playing and
[23:08] you'll get your money. It's simple,
[23:09] simple math. And until they find not
[23:12] just a bare market, but one that
[23:14] actually stays down for a long time,
[23:17] retail matters. They're an important
[23:19] component in this. And to show you how
[23:20] big that was $200 billion in in gambling
[23:23] a year for the PCE, so of the GDP. It's
[23:27] now bigger than new auto sales. This is
[23:30] the quarterly numbers of new autos. So
[23:32] if you haven't noticed what's been
[23:34] happening, new auto dollar has gone
[23:36] down. A lot of people buying used cars.
[23:38] You've got people cars are staying for
[23:40] longer periods of time. But I'm just
[23:42] telling you gambling has gone straight
[23:44] up over the last 20 years while new
[23:45] autos has gone down. That is a
[23:47] demographic shift. One of the things
[23:49] behind Bitcoin, but I'm just telling you
[23:51] this is a to mock retail is not there.
[23:53] We still have systematic equity
[23:55] positioning at the sixth percentile
[23:56] according to Deutsche Bank this week.
[23:58] You didn't want to be short down here.
[23:59] You didn't want to be short down here.
[24:01] You didn't want to be short down. I
[24:02] don't need to go through the whole thing
[24:04] at this point. Um Goldman Sachs said
[24:06] under all scenarios over the next week
[24:08] they're going to be buyers. Over the
[24:10] next month, massive buyers. So again,
[24:12] something needs to change. Pension
[24:14] funds, anyone who has a liability that
[24:16] needs to to meet some number, let's say
[24:18] five, 6% a year. What are they going to
[24:21] buy? Uh bonds. This is the US Barkclay
[24:24] for the last 5 years. So in the old days
[24:27] when yields would go down, when
[24:29] inflation was down and when we used to
[24:30] have recessions, you could buy bonds. If
[24:33] we don't have a recession, which I'm
[24:35] telling you is not going to happen, will
[24:37] we have a slowdown? Yes. Will we fire
[24:39] lots of people? No. If we don't fire
[24:41] lots of people, I don't expect bond
[24:42] yields to go down because we didn't do
[24:44] anything on the fiscal side. And I think
[24:47] the problem is again, nobody wants to
[24:49] buy the debt. So, the US has said, "We
[24:51] don't want to be the global reserve
[24:52] currency." The foreigners said, "We
[24:53] don't want you to be the global reserve
[24:54] currency." We still have a massive debt
[24:56] problem. I will continue to say the
[24:58] biggest risk for the marketplace is that
[25:00] nobody comes to buy the bonds and we
[25:02] have to figure out a solution for this
[25:04] which I'll address at the end. But this
[25:05] is the five-year performance. So what
[25:07] would you rather own when the S&P is
[25:08] down here from falling from here? If
[25:10] you're an allocator, you're like, "Oh,
[25:12] I'm getting a chance to buy the S&P at
[25:13] the same level it was back here or I
[25:15] could buy bonds. Why would I buy bonds?"
[25:17] So many people are still using the old
[25:19] recession playbook uh with bonds. And
[25:21] all you have to do is read Ray Dalio.
[25:23] Whether you think he's selling books or
[25:25] he's doing whatever, he is doing a lot
[25:27] of this stuff for free. The reality is I
[25:29] agree with what he's saying to a degree.
[25:32] The changes are coming. I do believe
[25:34] that the tariffs have basically created
[25:37] problems that won't go
[25:39] away. That radically reduced
[25:41] independency with the US is a reality
[25:44] that has to be planned for. I completely
[25:45] agree with him. I do not believe that
[25:47] this can be reversed.
[25:49] Um, and I don't believe that they're
[25:52] going to be able to pull off a beautiful
[25:54] deleveraging. And the reason is because
[25:56] I don't think the global
[25:58] investors are going to invest in the US
[26:02] the way they did in the past. If
[26:04] countries start buying US debt,
[26:05] everything changes. Completely agree.
[26:07] Um, at this point, I think they're going
[26:08] to buy it. But I think we've gotten to
[26:11] the point where uh the bond market
[26:13] becomes the bigger thing. I'm just
[26:15] showing this because tenure notes have
[26:17] sat in this range now for a while.
[26:19] There's a big move coming and if I had
[26:21] to guess which way the big move is
[26:22] coming, I will say it's up as opposed to
[26:25] down. Most people would answer down
[26:27] because they think there's a recession.
[26:29] I happen to believe the risk is that
[26:31] again we're going to have an incident
[26:34] the next time that the stock market is
[26:36] falling. And I think it's going to be
[26:37] driven by these two factors. The dollar
[26:39] I do not think also can be owned. I
[26:41] heard a lot of people trying to pick the
[26:42] bottom in this. uh a rally in the dollar
[26:44] to me is going to be shortlived. I think
[26:46] the easiest way for people to think
[26:47] about I don't think they should be
[26:49] getting rid of US equities. I still
[26:51] think the growth rate on US equities and
[26:53] the dynamic nature of the economy where
[26:55] we're not doing the austerity means that
[26:58] we shouldn't be avoided on the stock
[27:00] market. But on the currency side, I
[27:02] think now going forward, they're going
[27:03] to continue to ddollarize at a faster
[27:05] pace and the world is flush with
[27:07] dollars. So I think it's still going to
[27:09] be on the weaker side. I think it'll
[27:10] take some time. Um, again for the Mag 7,
[27:14] probably the biggest risk that I see,
[27:16] uh, and the reason I like the non- tech
[27:18] side is not just the AI side, but
[27:20] because they get 49% of their revenues
[27:22] overseas. One thing I heard in London,
[27:24] uh, I just think people are going to be
[27:26] on buying less American products, uh, in
[27:29] result of what's gone on. So, uh, we
[27:32] most of our revenues for those companies
[27:34] come, not most of them, 50% of them come
[27:36] overseas. Uh, jumping to the tech side,
[27:38] humanoids. Uh, UPS in talks with startup
[27:41] Figure AAI. Figure AAI is probably um
[27:44] the best company in the US to at least
[27:46] read about on humanoids. UPS talking
[27:49] about getting involved. Uh,
[27:51] CNBC basically uh did a report estimated
[27:55] number of human workers expect to be
[27:57] replaced by humanoid robots uh by
[28:01] 2030, you know, 500,000. and the numbers
[28:04] go. The only reason I'm showing this is
[28:06] this is what everyone talks about. Every
[28:07] investor I read everything. This is what
[28:09] the future looks like. So, a decade from
[28:12] now puts us out here. 1.4
[28:15] million. We're going to it's going to be
[28:17] job replacement, but we're going to have
[28:18] a shortage of people as it is. Um Bane
[28:21] did a big report on humanoids this week
[28:23] worth going through. Uh Morgan Stanley
[28:25] came out with a report $5 trillion
[28:28] opportunity. Uh a podcast to listen to.
[28:31] uh moonshots with Peter Diamandis. He
[28:33] did his abundance 360. Uh Brett Agcock
[28:37] is the CEO of Figure AI which I
[28:42] referenced. Uh figure three, one of
[28:44] their robots launching this year. It's
[28:45] 90% cheaper in production, ready for
[28:47] global scale. Demand is overwhelming.
[28:49] 100 plus thousand robots could be
[28:51] deployed today if supply allowed. $300 a
[28:54] month uh is the price target. Uh again,
[28:58] 247 autonomous labor as affordable as a
[29:02] lease car. This is not a 10-year vision.
[29:03] Robots of scale are coming this decade.
[29:06] Uh Bitcoin final part of this uh
[29:09] presentation. Best looking chart out
[29:11] there. We've already blown above the 200
[29:13] day moving average. Uh new highs are
[29:15] coming soon in my opinion, very soon. Uh
[29:18] here is what has happened in Bitcoin
[29:22] since the launch of the ETF relative to
[29:25] the MAG 7. Bitcoin is up 207%. Mag 7 is
[29:29] now only up, I'm sorry, up 107%. It's
[29:31] doubled. And the MAG 7 is now only up
[29:34] 44% which is where it was back here in
[29:36] July. This gap to me is going to
[29:38] continue to widen out this year. I do
[29:40] not think the MAG 7 is going above the
[29:41] highs. So I think we are at best case
[29:43] scenario building kind of a sideways
[29:45] pattern here. uh while Bitcoin goes
[29:47] higher. This is going to drive a lot of
[29:49] people into the market. Uh and part of
[29:51] the reason is 60-day V on Bitcoin. You
[29:54] hear how volatile Bitcoin is. It's
[29:56] coming down. The Mag 7 has been coming
[29:58] up. They're both around 50 right now.
[30:01] This is a big deal. And part of the
[30:03] reason it's a big deal is because we
[30:05] just had correlation. Look at the
[30:07] correlation. Stocks, bonds, and the
[30:08] dollar. Bitcoin is a global asset. It's
[30:11] not a US asset. So are the MAG7. The mag
[30:14] 7 50% come from overseas. Bitcoin is a
[30:17] global asset. You will see more and more
[30:20] institutions and retail this year
[30:22] accelerate money. I thought Bitcoin
[30:24] would double this year. My estimates
[30:26] based on the situ the unintended
[30:28] consequences of the tariffs are much
[30:30] higher. Anyone who wants to talk about
[30:31] it, reach out to
[30:32] 22vresearch.com. I will spend the time
[30:34] on why this macro asset you need to put
[30:36] your time in now because it will be
[30:38] providing alpha and portfolios as it has
[30:40] been with uh some companies across the
[30:43] globe and more governments to come. The
[30:45] Bitcoin ETF had a huge inflow
[30:48] surge this week. Four major wirehouses
[30:51] are going to start offering Bitcoin ETFs
[30:54] to clients. I was turned off by Meil
[30:56] Lynch this year. Told I couldn't buy the
[30:59] ETF. Charles Schwab, it's on a clear
[31:02] path to launching Bitcoin and crypto
[31:04] buying. We have a green light from
[31:06] regulators. Uh, Bitcoin's rise driven by
[31:08] institutions, not retail, says Bitwise.
[31:10] They're going out every day and talking
[31:12] to institutions and more and more of
[31:14] them have been doing their homework and
[31:15] they're starting to put money to work.
[31:16] That's why there's a bid underneath all
[31:18] the time. Uh, this is not at this point
[31:20] being driven by people jumping into the
[31:22] market. This is being driven by a bid
[31:24] underneath. Arizona State approves first
[31:27] ever Bitcoin reserve. This is in the
[31:29] governor's hands. We'll see if it is
[31:32] approved or if the governor chooses to
[31:34] get fired. Um, Brazil's largest bank, it
[31:39] uh basically going to do a micro a micro
[31:42] strategy.
[31:43] Copycat. Uh, President Trump's executive
[31:46] director says there's a space race among
[31:48] countries who accumulate Bitcoin. Now,
[31:51] I'm going to go through stable coins,
[31:53] which I've talked about before and I
[31:55] brought up last week and I'm going to
[31:56] say it again. Uh you cannot go into a
[31:59] coffee shop and buy coffee with gold or
[32:01] euros or yen in New York, but you can go
[32:03] in and buy it with Bitcoin. This will
[32:05] continue to be a story I will say
[32:06] repeatedly, and the reason is because
[32:08] you can sell your Bitcoin while you're
[32:09] online, get your stable coins, and then
[32:11] get it onto your stable coin card. Uh
[32:14] Visa and Mastercoin. So, Chamath, who
[32:17] I'm on strike with listening to uh the
[32:19] All-In podcast because of the biased
[32:21] nature of it now, uh propaganda, I can't
[32:23] listen to it, but uh he did put this out
[32:27] on Mastercard and
[32:30] Visa basically continuing to increase
[32:33] the the ability for people not in the US
[32:36] around the globe to use this for
[32:37] crossber but also for transactions. Uh
[32:40] our best estimate JP Morgan is that the
[32:42] market size for stable coins has the
[32:43] potential to go to 500 to 750 billion
[32:45] over the coming years and of course that
[32:48] would become a massive buyer of
[32:50] treasuries because they're already a
[32:51] massive buyer of treasuries. Uh Stripe
[32:54] I've highlighted this company many many
[32:56] times test new stable coin project has
[32:57] 3.7 trillion market used that is again
[33:01] crossborder. Um here is the launch for
[33:04] the fuse card. Again, this is the Visa
[33:06] virtual Visa card to spend stable coins
[33:09] anywhere. Uh they go through this
[33:12] including offramps in Mexico. This is
[33:14] just going to continue to be a story
[33:16] that you're going to hear about.
[33:16] Mastercard add stable coin. Again, this
[33:18] is all this
[33:19] week. Uh we announced our endto-end
[33:22] capabilities to support stable coins,
[33:24] ensuring payments can be made or
[33:25] received using them anytime, anywhere.
[33:28] So, when Bitcoin is told to me, it's not
[33:30] a currency. Yes, it is. You can convert
[33:32] all of this immediately into currency.
[33:34] You cannot do that with other things and
[33:36] it is global and you can do it all over
[33:37] the world. So again this continues to be
[33:41] a situation where it's merging with the
[33:44] fiat system. So it is the new system of
[33:46] the future. The government is totally
[33:49] supporting this. In fact it is a
[33:50] tailwind behind it. So whatever your
[33:52] negative side was on it in the past. If
[33:54] you meet people or read macro people
[33:56] just go back and see what they were
[33:57] saying in 2019 and if they are saying
[34:00] the same things now you should not be
[34:02] listening to them at all. You can
[34:03] believe that it can be hacked. You can
[34:05] believe all of this stuff. That's fine.
[34:06] But to say that it's not becoming part
[34:08] of the system and you should be looking
[34:09] at it as an investment. Every investment
[34:11] has risk. Bitcoin's risk due to many,
[34:15] many factors, but also stable coins risk
[34:16] has gone down. Uh stable coin
[34:18] transaction volumes hit 1.82 trillion
[34:20] last month. You want to invest in things
[34:23] that look like this. You try to tell me
[34:25] anything you've seen in the last 5 years
[34:27] of research that looks like that.
[34:29] nothing in the world from an investment
[34:31] standpoint right now can you find of
[34:33] this kind of size with that kind of
[34:35] chart. Venture investors had hoped for
[34:37] IPO recovery in 2025, but now it's on
[34:40] hold. This is something that I'm going
[34:41] to finish up with. So, the IPO market is
[34:43] pretty much dead. I've shown how the
[34:45] credit markets had frozen. At the same
[34:47] time that that's going on, there's been
[34:50] a flurry of crypto
[34:51] deals. Crypto deals in value grow. This
[34:56] is going to be a record year for sure.
[34:58] But what I really want to go through is
[35:00] make sure that every time you hear about
[35:02] Micro Strategy and someone focuses, they
[35:04] always focus on how much he bought. I
[35:08] just want to remind people the money is
[35:10] coming from investors in the fiat
[35:12] system. He is able to tap the capital
[35:14] markets for massive size, take that
[35:17] money and go buy Bitcoin. That demand is
[35:19] there. So it may not come from you. You
[35:22] may say that he is there. But the
[35:24] easiest way for this not to work is to
[35:26] not have people buy the products. But
[35:27] the products are working. So you're
[35:30] fading Bitcoin and Michael Sailor just
[35:32] continues to do it. So I will continue
[35:34] to say he's raising another 21 billion.
[35:37] Yes, look at that number. 21 billion.
[35:39] How many IPOs or any kind of capital
[35:41] market raises including US
[35:44] treasuries? 21 billion he's able to tap
[35:47] the fiat system and market. So every
[35:50] time that you sit there and say it's a
[35:51] scam, every investor, whether it's
[35:53] insurance company in the convert market
[35:55] or anyone on the equity side that's a go
[35:57] look at the holders in Micro Strategy,
[35:59] he's able to do this. So it is not a
[36:02] scam. He's able to tap the markets. He's
[36:04] tapping the fiat system to take money
[36:06] and bring it into the digital system.
[36:08] And I will end with this. Everyone needs
[36:11] to go watch this video because this
[36:13] makes perfect sense to me. And this is
[36:16] something from everything that I've gone
[36:17] through the government could do. So the
[36:20] government can't remember the tricky
[36:21] words. We will not
[36:24] use cash from the taxpayers to buy
[36:27] Bitcoin. But you don't think that using
[36:30] the Michael Sailor strategy of issuing a
[36:32] government bond, a $2 trillion issuance
[36:35] where they raise 200 billion worth of
[36:38] Bitcoin by 90% of it basically being
[36:41] treasuries of which you only get a 1%
[36:43] coupon as opposed to a foreign uh a
[36:46] half and then you have some kind of
[36:48] split on the performance of Bitcoin for
[36:50] both the investor and also the taxpayer.
[36:53] That's what this idea is. I went through
[36:56] that presentation. We have to do
[36:58] something on the federal debt market.
[37:00] The new currency market or the new
[37:03] system will involve Bitcoin. In my
[37:06] opinion, before the end of this year,
[37:07] this will be a real story. So for every
[37:09] macro person who doesn't see the
[37:11] connection between Bitcoin and
[37:13] treasuries, Bitcoin and the s the stock
[37:15] market. I call Bitcoin the S&P 500. I'm
[37:19] happy to sit with anyone and go through
[37:20] this in a clear, concise manner, but if
[37:22] it starts with it's a scam, it's
[37:24] worthless, just don't listen to them.
[37:26] That's it for this week. I'll see you
[37:28] guys next week.
