--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Let's get going. Big week again. Trump
[00:02] keeps us busy. Um, China deal. Vbottom.
[00:07] Nope. This has definitely been an
[00:08] Ibottom. Uh, one of the fastest
[00:10] recoveries in history. Sentiment still
[00:12] bearish though. Waiting for the hard
[00:13] data and the recession and whatever
[00:15] else. I'll go through that. Uh, lower
[00:18] tariffs, more deficits, the tax bills
[00:21] going through and obviously we'll see
[00:23] where it ends up. Uh, but on Friday, we
[00:26] get a Moody's drown grade. absolutely
[00:28] earn given everything that's gone on.
[00:30] I'll go through that and what it means.
[00:33] Uh trade wars are capital wars and
[00:35] that's where we're going to start to
[00:36] switch over now. So I'm going to talk a
[00:38] lot more about the capital side of this
[00:40] um which I started last week and then
[00:43] important one for all hedge fund long
[00:45] short people. Uh I did this on the
[00:48] weekly podcast with Pomp which you guys
[00:51] can go listen to as well. He's got an
[00:53] interesting view. It's why he and I have
[00:55] teamed up because of this one. how AI
[00:58] and the crypto market with stable coins
[01:00] are disrupting the public markets and
[01:02] how this is going to play out in terms
[01:04] of less equity companies going forward
[01:07] that are public. Uh Bitcoin adoption
[01:09] continues and now the Asia money is
[01:13] going to be unleashed. So uh he told us
[01:17] uh on Friday better go out and buy
[01:18] stocks and we got five straight up days
[01:21] post that. Uh, I thought this was the
[01:24] important way to look at this rather
[01:26] than just say there's no more tariffs.
[01:27] No one wants to do a generalized
[01:29] decoupling, but we are going to do a
[01:31] strategic decoupling
[01:34] uh because they're dependent on each
[01:35] other. So on all of these things, this
[01:38] is not the end of the negotiations.
[01:40] There will be back and forth. Uh for
[01:43] now, the stock market is cheering, but
[01:44] as this says, the tariff damage is done.
[01:47] Uh the tariff damage in terms of what
[01:49] goes on just means there will be some
[01:51] more losers. But as I go through this,
[01:53] uh there is a winner that's showing up
[01:55] in the markets and I think everyone has
[01:57] forgot about it. Uh by the way, I'm
[01:59] sporting all my uh my Knicks clothes and
[02:02] hats. So for all the Nick fans out
[02:03] there, congratulations. Uh Marco Papic
[02:06] put this out a long time ago in terms of
[02:08] uh and I mean a long time ago, way
[02:10] before everything started in terms of
[02:12] his six stages of what goes on with with
[02:15] Trump and what to expect based on his
[02:17] last time. And basically we followed the
[02:20] entire thing in here. liberation day,
[02:22] make friends, then have another fallout.
[02:25] Whether or not we get that, I don't
[02:26] think the market's going to care. Um, in
[02:29] terms of hedge fund
[02:31] capitulation, second biggest short
[02:33] covering on record during Monday's uh
[02:36] March
[02:37] meltdown, here are the five days in a
[02:39] row of positive S&P. There were a lot of
[02:41] people this day saying it would finish,
[02:42] I was reading on X, uh, S&P is going to
[02:45] finish red on the day by people who've
[02:47] been bearish the entire time. It's now
[02:49] 16 of 19 days and this little white line
[02:52] here is when Scott Besson went out with
[02:54] hedge funds through JP Morgan and
[02:56] basically the next day was yeah there's
[02:58] going to be a deescalation in China. If
[03:01] you just would have followed this or
[03:03] when Trump basically said buy stocks
[03:05] before this rally happened. Um markets
[03:09] are somewhat rigged and again I've said
[03:10] it before reminds me of emerging
[03:12] markets. Now here's where we are year to
[03:14] date. S&P finished up 1.3%.
[03:17] this side here, which you can't see
[03:19] because my face is in between. I'll just
[03:21] move it over a little bit. That's in
[03:22] currency terms. What I want you to
[03:24] understand is the S&P is up 1.3%. As a
[03:28] US investor, as a European investor, uh,
[03:31] in euros, it's down 6%. Remember the
[03:34] S&P
[03:35] names, US in general, are about
[03:38] 75%. They're less now, but let's say
[03:41] greater than 70% of the MSCI world. For
[03:45] years, this has built up. So there's a
[03:46] lot of unhedged positions. The reason I
[03:48] bring this up is this is a drag. So even
[03:50] though you have all these numbers now
[03:52] all positive, the currency has been a
[03:55] negative. This is going to be a major
[03:56] story going forward in my opinion. It's
[03:58] one of the reasons why I continue to say
[04:01] this is going to be a repatriation of
[04:04] capital for two reasons. One is what
[04:07] Trump has basically done with the
[04:09] tariffs and the fact that we're
[04:11] rebalancing the entire global economy
[04:13] and trade. The dollar has benefited
[04:15] significantly, Asia in particular is
[04:17] going to be in repatriation. But then
[04:19] the other thing that Pomp and I are
[04:20] talking about and that I'm going to
[04:22] continue to write about and I highlight
[04:23] in this video, AI is going to be a
[04:26] massive disruption to that and all long
[04:28] duration assets will be infected by
[04:30] rising yields and by AI disruption. Uh
[04:34] S&P I this chart for people saying
[04:36] retest of the lows. Like I said, this is
[04:38] an I. I think anyone basically saying
[04:42] there's a retest is either stubborn or
[04:44] they're hoping there's a retest to buy
[04:47] um before it actually retests. Uh you
[04:49] can see the names, the tariff name
[04:51] obviously in terms of autos and comps,
[04:53] but look at technology semis in
[04:55] particular up 40%
[04:57] uh since April 8th for zero. So I'm
[05:01] going to go through why this is so
[05:02] important, but I just want to highlight
[05:04] it there. Semis are really the thing
[05:06] that I'm focused on. Uh I wrote a bunch
[05:08] of papers over the course of the last
[05:10] three weeks, but in in particular this
[05:11] week, I wrote one on inference. We have
[05:13] Nvidia coming up in two weeks. And here
[05:16] we are on the on the socks. Um we broke
[05:18] above the 20week moving
[05:21] average and we've got a massive
[05:24] crossover happening on the weekly
[05:26] MACD's. And again, I think people uh
[05:30] we're basically playing for a recession.
[05:32] Um, semis fit into two categories. For
[05:36] any quant that does a back test on
[05:38] recessions or anything that would cause
[05:39] a recession, semis would fit in with a
[05:42] lot of other things. Uh, so it makes
[05:44] sense. But also generalists and everyone
[05:46] was crowded into AI trades across
[05:49] industries. Uh, and semis got caught in
[05:52] that unwind. So there's just been no
[05:54] liquidity on the way down and then on
[05:56] the way back up there's also no
[05:58] liquidity which is why we get these fast
[05:59] moves. Uh, I highlighted this at the end
[06:02] of the year, and I just want to make
[06:03] sure that we go through this because
[06:04] it's normalized. So, here's where we
[06:06] are. This is the long-term chart back to
[06:08] 1990. The orange line here is a
[06:09] year-over-year S&P. The white line here
[06:12] is the percentage of people in the
[06:14] Conference Board survey that expect
[06:16] stocks to be higher a year from now. So,
[06:18] we were up at the highest level in
[06:20] history. And what I said at the end of
[06:21] the year was this is going to need to
[06:24] come back down. And what'll follow is
[06:26] you'll get year-over-year S&P to go
[06:28] down. doesn't need to be a bare market,
[06:30] just needs to get down. We've reset
[06:33] everything, guys. So, now that's come
[06:34] all the way back down. So, the sentiment
[06:36] and the positioning has come down, which
[06:38] means we've cleared everything. Uh,
[06:40] Ibottom, sixth time in history, the S&P
[06:43] soared at least 18% in just 25 trading
[06:47] days. Uh, this is in the history. Here's
[06:50] what we did over the course
[06:52] of the next 250 trading days or one
[06:56] year. The worst was up 11% from this
[06:59] period. Most of the returns
[07:02] are even higher. Uh the VIX just
[07:05] experienced its fastest reversal from
[07:07] over 40 to under 20 in history. We got
[07:10] another uh breath thrust. Uh this is a
[07:14] combo breath thrust. So Jeff Degraphth,
[07:16] who does great work, he has a different
[07:17] way of measuring it which is based on uh
[07:20] 20 percentage of 20-day highs. Uh and
[07:23] then you've got the Zwag one and here
[07:25] are the one year later. So again,
[07:26] whether you're using the actual move
[07:29] itself or the breath of the move in
[07:31] terms of
[07:32] thrust, you're looking at something that
[07:34] I, you know, again, uh earnings are
[07:37] good, the economy is good, everyone
[07:39] thinks a recession is coming. I'll go
[07:40] through that and I wrote about that this
[07:42] week, too. Uh battered Wall Street short
[07:44] brigade is refusing to admit defeat.
[07:46] This came out Friday at 440. So after
[07:49] five straight up days, after all the
[07:50] pullback on the tariffs and basically
[07:53] taking us back to some degree where we
[07:55] were at the beginning of the year, now
[07:57] we're focusing on taxes, we didn't cut
[07:59] as much in Doge and yet refusing to
[08:02] admit defeat. I've talked about basian
[08:05] uh thinking. Uh you know, not to pick on
[08:07] anyone, but again, retest the lows,
[08:09] retest the lows, retest the lows, retest
[08:11] the lows. uh I can't listen to podcasts
[08:13] right now because the majority of them
[08:16] when I say majority I'll say 85%
[08:20] uh are of people basically saying it'll
[08:22] go down and I it's not like I want to
[08:25] listen to the people that were saying it
[08:27] would go up before but that's why you
[08:29] can't really listen to anyone right now
[08:31] because the downside is no one really
[08:33] stuck their head out uh and told people
[08:36] when the thing sold off that at least we
[08:38] were getting a good opportunity to buy.
[08:39] Here's where the AI is. Finally, we're
[08:42] down to 44. So, we finally broke below
[08:44] 50. We had been above 50 for uh many
[08:47] weeks, but again, the historical average
[08:49] of bears, normally we have about 37%
[08:51] bulls. We're getting close on on the
[08:54] bulls. Uh the average bears down to 31.
[08:56] We're not there yet. So, we still have a
[08:58] ways to go on that. Goldman sentiment
[09:01] has improved. Uh shout out to Neil
[09:03] Sephy. I've been using a lot of his
[09:05] stuff on here. Uh he does good work. I'd
[09:08] be following him, guys. Uh he puts out a
[09:11] lot hardworking, never met him,
[09:12] hardworking guy. Lot of stuff, but it's
[09:15] usually really good stuff. He's a good
[09:16] filterer. Uh equity sentiment indicator
[09:19] still down there on Goldman side. Long
[09:22] short, uh still low. CTA positioning,
[09:28] CTA model as buyers of global equities
[09:30] in most scenarios over the next week or
[09:32] month. We still have catch-up for CTAs.
[09:34] In terms of the V control strategies,
[09:37] they're going to add length because VS
[09:39] come off so much. They definitely have
[09:40] room for it. Our model estimates that V
[09:42] control positioning is 40% below the
[09:44] 2-year average. Risk parity is even
[09:47] further below.
[09:50] And we did have the put call ratio come
[09:52] down which normally I would say is a
[09:55] contrarian bearish indicator except in
[09:57] this case it's down there because people
[10:00] are bearishly positioned and they're
[10:03] more worried about the upside at this
[10:05] point. And so even though uh you could
[10:08] take it as a short-term consolidation I
[10:10] I just wouldn't at this point I I with
[10:12] what I'm about to show you I I don't
[10:14] think it matters. So um here's the most
[10:16] important thing. So this is what I've
[10:18] heard in most podcasts. This is what I
[10:20] still say. The reason people haven't
[10:22] bailed out of their thoughts at this
[10:24] point is because they're expecting the
[10:26] hard data to come down in a recession to
[10:28] go through. So, we still have this gap
[10:30] between the hard data and the soft data.
[10:32] We got another hard data print this
[10:33] week. And again, no job losses. So,
[10:37] jobless claims which come out every
[10:38] week, we are still at the exact same
[10:40] level we've been at since the
[10:42] unemployment rate got down below 4%.
[10:44] There is no weakness in the jobs market.
[10:46] So for everyone calling for a recession,
[10:48] I've said this before, service spending,
[10:51] everything does not happen without job
[10:53] losses. No matter what you're hearing
[10:55] from economists, I don't care what it
[10:57] is. I don't care how weak the housing
[10:58] market is, how war commercial real
[10:59] estate is, the economy has changed over
[11:02] the course of the last 17 years, but
[11:04] economists are all above the age of
[11:08] let's say 50 minus 17 means they were
[11:11] 33. They already graduated college. They
[11:13] don't have time to learn about what AI
[11:14] is doing to the economy. Trust me, they
[11:16] don't have the time. They have kids. You
[11:19] can't possibly be an economist right
[11:21] now. Find me one at one of the major
[11:23] banks that's in their 30s. Age is a
[11:25] major negative for looking at the
[11:27] economy right now. Here is CPI. Uh came
[11:31] out this week. Lower than expected for
[11:33] both PPI and CPI at this point. I still
[11:36] expect this stuff to migrate higher
[11:37] because of the weaker dollar and because
[11:39] of the tariffs flowing through. I don't
[11:41] expect it to go crazy, but I do think at
[11:43] this point it is a tailwind that we're
[11:45] not getting inflation to go higher.
[11:48] Didn't really help the rate side because
[11:49] you get went had rates come down. Here's
[11:51] why, you know, the soft data is going to
[11:53] start picking up instead of the hard
[11:54] data coming down. Philly Fed outlook
[11:57] six-month forecast for new orders.
[11:59] Here's what got people freaked out. You
[12:01] had this big drop off, historic drop
[12:03] off. Guess what? You've now had a
[12:05] historic rise. Not surprising, but
[12:07] they're not talking about it. They'll
[12:09] tell you the Philly Fed didn't bounce
[12:11] much. They'll tell you it was a slight
[12:12] bit. And then the Michigan a million
[12:14] things about how you miss mesh was
[12:16] horrible. Survey showed sides of improve
[12:19] small signs of improvements. The
[12:20] inflation expectations through the roof
[12:22] in green here that I highlighted. The
[12:24] interviews were conducted between April
[12:26] 22nd and May 13th. The 90-day pause on
[12:29] China tariffs was reached May
[12:31] 12th. The report noted that many survey
[12:34] measures showed some signs of
[12:35] improvement following the temporary
[12:37] reduction in China tariffs. And we think
[12:38] sentiment at the end of May will fully
[12:40] reflect that. So
[12:42] again, the data is going to change.
[12:44] China to US container bookings soar 300%
[12:48] nearly or nearly 300% after the trade
[12:50] trade war truce. Everyone's rushing
[12:52] China's factories raised to ship goods
[12:55] amid trade truce. I speak with a ton of
[12:57] Americans that import from China. Their
[12:59] vendor books are completely or fully
[13:01] sold out. Earnings momentum. Another
[13:04] measurement of the soft data. Oh, just
[13:07] went
[13:08] positive after many weeks of negative.
[13:11] Not to pick on Neil Duda. I like his
[13:13] work, but don't care one bit about what
[13:16] he's saying in this thing. Doesn't
[13:17] matter one bit to me whatsoever without
[13:19] job losses. Given what we know about the
[13:21] job market, okay, there's no job losses.
[13:23] What do we know about it? Wage growth
[13:26] still there. It's more likely that
[13:29] consumer spending slows than incomes
[13:31] rise. doesn't take anything into account
[13:33] again in terms of the household net
[13:35] worth which is dramatic and the fact
[13:38] that this economy is based on the top
[13:40] 10% which are responsible for 50% of
[13:45] consumption in the country which is why
[13:47] Donald Trump was elected so that the
[13:49] bottom 90% of the or the 90% that are
[13:53] not there not able to spend as much
[13:55] could spend but a good a good portion of
[13:58] them are either retirees with money
[14:00] where they don't need to work So,
[14:01] they're still spending. And then you've
[14:03] got the transfer payments, which do
[14:04] include retirees that don't have money.
[14:07] It's a very hard thing when consumption
[14:08] is so topheavy and the stock market is
[14:10] responsible for them spending. You're
[14:13] going to see, oh, we've got
[14:14] delinquencies going up. We've got this.
[14:16] Again, guys, this is a a recession for
[14:19] many people. No doubt about it.
[14:22] Bankruptcies, I've talked about this for
[14:25] two, three years now in terms of my time
[14:27] at at Weiss as well. Bankruptcy filings
[14:30] are still there no matter what. So,
[14:33] we're continuously, it's not just this
[14:35] year, we had high bankruptcy, high
[14:37] bankruptcy. We're going to be in a
[14:39] position again where the economy has
[14:41] many, many companies that are going to
[14:43] go out of business. I wrote this for
[14:45] 22V. Reach out to
[14:47] 22vresearch.com if you want to go
[14:49] through it. Recessions aren't what they
[14:51] used to be, and neither is the economy.
[14:53] In right of the lease and tariffs, I've
[14:55] been asked repeatedly whether I think a
[14:56] recession is coming. My answer has been
[14:58] consistent. The term recession as
[15:00] defined over the past h 100red years no
[15:01] longer applies in the modern economy.
[15:03] This is not a question. This is a fact.
[15:06] Every time I say this, I can see the
[15:08] look I get like I'm trying to be
[15:09] provocative. But provocation is a
[15:11] two-way street. What seems provocative
[15:13] to one person may simply be clarity in
[15:15] motion. Sometimes it's not the speaker
[15:16] creating controversy. It's the listening
[15:19] refusing to update an outdated frame of
[15:23] reference. Very simple. The economy is
[15:25] not the same as it was before the
[15:26] iPhone. End of story. Great financial
[15:28] crisis change. The ability for the Fed
[15:31] to put money in whenever they want. No
[15:34] question about it. SVB would have been a
[15:37] recession. 22 would have been a rec.
[15:39] There's plenty of situations right now
[15:41] where we could have had recessions since
[15:43] the great financial crisis and they've
[15:45] stopped them. That's why when people
[15:47] predict them, it's the opposite. That's
[15:48] when the Fed put comes in. That's why
[15:51] people who trade Bitcoin make so much
[15:52] money and retail does because they know
[15:54] the Fed put is still there or the policy
[15:57] put. If we're gonna have a recession,
[15:59] it's going to have to be a policy
[16:01] choice. It is not going to happen the
[16:03] old traditional way. And what government
[16:05] is going to choose to get unelected?
[16:07] Trump was, I think, the last hope for
[16:09] that for a variety of reasons and it
[16:11] didn't happen. Here's a city surprise
[16:12] index overlaid with tenure rates. The
[16:14] thing that will be scaring the
[16:16] administration where the negative will
[16:17] come in for the second half of the year.
[16:19] Here's tenure rates. Here's the city
[16:21] surprise index. City surprise index is
[16:24] about to go higher. Do not get negative
[16:27] on stocks when the city surprise index
[16:29] goes higher after recession fears. Here
[16:32] were the two last recession fears. SVB
[16:34] and commercial real estate's going to
[16:36] put us in a recession. Oh my god,
[16:37] everything's going to end. S&P's the
[16:40] white line. You don't want to fade that.
[16:42] Here's the other 10ear rates. Okay, they
[16:44] went higher. At some point here, tenure
[16:47] rates mattered. In this case, it was
[16:48] when they got to 4%, they went down.
[16:51] Here we have the last recession fear.
[16:54] This is the SAM rule, Japanese yen
[16:57] recession fear. We get the selloff, city
[16:59] surprise index
[17:01] bottoms, S&P goes higher. Tenure rates,
[17:06] they start to go higher. So again, we're
[17:09] going to reach a point on tenure rates
[17:10] where it is going to matter. I happen to
[17:12] think that level is up here because I
[17:14] think it takes time after the recession
[17:16] fear. So, I think it's going to be
[17:17] higher. We obviously had a downgrade,
[17:19] which I'll go through as well. But
[17:22] that's where we are until the
[17:24] positioning is back in because the
[17:25] earnings are good and the economy is now
[17:28] fine. Tariffs do not cause inflation.
[17:31] They hurt demand. Larger deficits will
[17:34] cause inflation. I completely agree. And
[17:37] that's why inflation will be going
[17:39] higher. So, if tariffs come down and the
[17:41] big beautiful bill gets bigger and more
[17:43] beautiful, risk of recession goes down.
[17:45] on risk of inflation goes up. Warm pies.
[17:47] I agree with them on this. This is the
[17:49] way people should be going. Uh the tax
[17:51] as tax bill is starting to take shape.
[17:53] Likely to deliver front-loaded stimulus
[17:55] for consumers and firms, boost capex and
[17:58] therefore GDP growth starting in Q4.
[18:02] Frontloaded stimulus for consumers and
[18:04] firms. Anticipation of the bill helps
[18:06] keep a lid on layoffs and unemployment
[18:08] rates. So again, we're going to avoid a
[18:11] recession um based on even this part of
[18:14] it. Uh, and if we had anything, maybe
[18:16] we'll get a few hundred thousand job
[18:18] losses, but this is not the same economy
[18:20] and it's going to be really hard to kill
[18:21] it. And the fact is, you've seen this
[18:24] now for 15 years that every time people
[18:26] have called for a recession, it hasn't
[18:27] happened except when there's a policy
[18:29] choice like shutting down the entire
[18:31] economy for COVID. Uh, I'm not going to
[18:33] take you through all this, but basically
[18:35] uh the analysis by the committee for a
[18:37] responsible federal budget. This is not
[18:39] done yet. It obviously is being held up
[18:41] for exactly this reason. add roughly
[18:43] three trillion dollars to debt
[18:47] and setting the stage for more than five
[18:49] trillion of additional debt if
[18:50] policymakers ultimately extend temporary
[18:53] provisions. So again, the there there's
[18:56] no focus on the deficit at this point.
[18:58] Uh I put this in the chat GPT to go
[19:01] through it. You guys can read it on your
[19:02] own. It's got all the different things,
[19:04] but basically the discontent that's in
[19:07] there, why are hardline conservatives,
[19:09] particularly budget hawks, are barking
[19:10] at the bill's massive three and a half
[19:12] to5 trillion price tag. So again, um
[19:15] they're having trouble with this. And so
[19:17] Moody's finally uh the last one, it it
[19:20] was the last AAA rating. They they
[19:22] didn't do this in 2011, but obviously
[19:25] you're going to read a lot about the S&P
[19:28] downgrade, what that meant for stocks,
[19:30] what that meant for bonds. you're going
[19:31] to hear all this stuff. Uh it lost its
[19:34] credit rating, but this I mean that
[19:36] should not be a surprise, but just to
[19:38] show the difference. Um when it happened
[19:40] here, so again 2011, the unemployment
[19:44] rate was
[19:46] 8%. And here's where we were on the
[19:49] deficit or this is the unemployment rate
[19:51] and this is the deficit. So again, the
[19:53] difference is now we have an
[19:54] unemployment rate down here. This is why
[19:56] it's so much worse. We have a budget
[19:58] deficit at a time where we don't need
[20:02] the deficit to keep the economy going
[20:04] theoretically because we have full
[20:05] employment, but they're not even able to
[20:07] reduce this at this point. And now we're
[20:09] talking about more spending on top of
[20:11] it. So it shouldn't be a surprise about
[20:14] the the the downgrade. Uh another way to
[20:16] look at it, here's the interest expense
[20:18] at $1.1 trillion. Here it was back here
[20:21] at 400 billion. This is defense spending
[20:24] which again back here was not too
[20:27] different than where it is now. It's a
[20:28] difference of a hundred billion while
[20:30] the difference in in the there should be
[20:32] more fear in terms of the fact we're
[20:34] paying off interest with everything. Um
[20:37] deregulation does not roll off tongue
[20:40] eventually when the bonds become an
[20:41] issue. Um here's the deregulation. Fed
[20:44] QE run through the banks doesn't it?
[20:46] Blah blah blah. Uh I happen to agree. Uh
[20:49] all right I wanted to segue here. This
[20:51] is one podcast I did listen to for
[20:53] anyone who now that we're kind of
[20:55] through the tariffs. This is not the end
[20:56] of the tariffs. I highly recommend
[20:58] listening to this podcast with Russell
[21:01] Napier. I recommend him, but he is my
[21:02] favorite historian by far. Um, and the
[21:05] main point he makes is the idea that
[21:07] trade wars aren't capital wars is the
[21:09] problem. I completely agree. focusing on
[21:12] trade and trying to go through on an
[21:14] 1800s to 1900s thing. It's the capital
[21:17] flows that are going to matter
[21:18] tremendously because that's been the one
[21:20] the offset to all of this, but it's also
[21:22] been where the dollars in the US are so
[21:24] dramatically big relative to everything
[21:27] else. Here are the timestamps on it in
[21:29] terms of what he what he goes through.
[21:32] Uh there's a lot of good stuff in here.
[21:34] I do agree with with most of it. Um he
[21:37] talks in particular about the net
[21:40] international investment position. The
[21:42] US has a deficit right now of $26
[21:44] trillion. Meaning foreigners own $26
[21:48] trillion of our economy net relative to
[21:51] we what we own externally. So that just
[21:54] means that if there's repatriation, US
[21:56] assets are going to suffer at a minimum
[21:58] in in relative valuation terms. Uh if
[22:02] money goes back, it's the same thing
[22:03] goes with the currency. That means
[22:05] there's a tremendous amount of currency
[22:06] that can go the other direction,
[22:08] assuming it's not hedged at this point.
[22:10] Um, this is what stands out in terms of
[22:12] the dollar. So, I do want to separate
[22:14] this. The white line here is the S&P.
[22:16] The orange line here is the the dollar
[22:18] index. Here's what happened on the last
[22:21] recession fears. So, the dollar did come
[22:24] down. Same thing on here. Remember, this
[22:26] was dollar yen that was rallying and
[22:29] helping to have the dollar to have a big
[22:31] move. But then what went on is the
[22:33] dollar eventually started to rally again
[22:35] as stocks went higher. That's what I
[22:38] don't think is going to happen this
[22:39] time. So a lot of people are going to
[22:41] have to start watching the dollar and
[22:43] I'll talk about when this will become an
[22:44] issue. The difference is this time to me
[22:48] it's this one. So dollar this is the
[22:51] Asian dollar index which again this
[22:53] dollar Asian dollar rallying against the
[22:55] US dollar at the same time that
[22:58] TLT was going up. Well, right now TLT is
[23:02] going down, meaning rates are going
[23:04] higher. This has been lock
[23:06] step. If we lose the repatriation,
[23:09] meaning if rates get more attractive and
[23:12] we see yields get higher and we don't
[23:14] see the dollar rally versus the Asian
[23:16] currencies, this is the break that is
[23:18] the most important in the world. It is
[23:19] not the euro currency. It is the Asian
[23:22] dollar verse rates. This is the thing to
[23:24] pay attention to. This is where China
[23:26] is. This is where Japan is. This is
[23:27] where Taiwan is. This is every single
[23:29] thing in my opinion that matters on the
[23:31] global scale. Too much focus on the
[23:33] dollar has been on the European
[23:35] currencies. I think this matters for a
[23:37] ton of reasons including Latin America.
[23:40] Uh so for everyone focusing on things,
[23:42] that's the chart that's most important
[23:43] to me. And again, Taiwan warning sign
[23:47] had the big move. Korea had big moves
[23:49] this week. Hong Kong dollar, the
[23:51] futures, the forwards are trading way
[23:53] outside the band. meaning all of a
[23:55] sudden you get the Hong Kong dollar
[23:57] going which is not normal. Uh gold I
[24:00] want to go back I want to just highlight
[24:02] that for everyone who's long gold not
[24:04] saying this is going to happen uh and
[24:06] I'll I'll go through the reasons because
[24:07] we if the dollar is weakened it's
[24:09] different but this is where the debt was
[24:12] downgraded in the US back in August 11
[24:15] and gold went into a sideways pattern
[24:17] for a
[24:19] decade. Here's where we are in gold now.
[24:22] So, we'll see what happens. Um, the
[24:25] reason I don't think that's going to
[24:26] happen is because this is what the
[24:27] dollar did at that point. So, again, the
[24:30] debt was downgraded in the US and the
[24:32] dollar rallied continuously for the next
[24:34] five years. I don't think that's
[24:36] happening this time. This is the
[24:38] difference and this is why when you get
[24:39] everything on what's going to happen is
[24:40] it going to be rates? Is it going to be
[24:41] this? The dollar and rates correlation
[24:44] is the most important thing. All right.
[24:46] the Steven Mirren framework and the
[24:48] reason that I care about the bond market
[24:49] so much with the dollar addressing the
[24:52] dollar overvaluation. Mirren's and this
[24:54] is from his paper. Okay, this is from
[24:56] the November paper. Uh chat GPT give
[24:59] them the three things. Okay, check mark.
[25:00] Implementing strategic tariffs. Okay, we
[25:03] did that. Check mark. Issuance of
[25:05] century bonds could be perceived as a
[25:07] form of debt restructuring potentially
[25:09] undermining confidence in US
[25:11] creditworthiness. That's what we have
[25:13] left, guys. Check mark. Watch the bonds.
[25:16] Um, in that podcast with Russell Napier,
[25:19] I asked this in this podcast, do they
[25:21] talk about AI or Bitcoin? No. AI and
[25:23] Bitcoin are not discussed in this
[25:24] podcast episode. So again, as he's
[25:27] talking about a new regime, as he's
[25:29] talking about this, I want to remind you
[25:31] most people above their 50s have domain
[25:34] experience. They have tremendous
[25:36] experience about the system that we were
[25:38] in. They are not spending the time on AI
[25:40] or Bitcoin. I have no one to talk to.
[25:42] Please, I need more people to have a
[25:44] conversation with this that aren't
[25:45] Canadian or from outside the US.
[25:48] Someone Do you think they should have
[25:50] talked about Bitcoin or this is who I
[25:52] have to talk to? I have to talk to Chad
[25:53] GPT. Why AI and Bitcoin should have been
[25:56] part of the discussion? Yes. And here's
[25:59] why. The fourth turning narrative is
[26:01] about structural transformation and AI
[26:03] is arguably the biggest technological
[26:05] inflection points in the internet or
[26:07] electricity. I won't go through all
[26:09] these points. Bitcoin is becoming
[26:11] intreasingly institutionalized and could
[26:13] be viewed as a digital gold hedge in the
[26:15] kind of regime Russell warns about. He
[26:18] doesn't mention either AI or anything on
[26:20] there. Eye on the market, Michael
[26:22] Sembleis must readad every time it comes
[26:24] out. He's one of my favorite guys out
[26:26] there. He's an independent thinker. He
[26:28] says what he believes. I don't find him
[26:30] to be perma anything. I think he just
[26:32] states the facts. He's my favorite one
[26:34] in terms of just putting this stuff out
[26:35] there. Uh it's free. It's great. Um I I
[26:40] I highly recommend it. And what he
[26:42] talked about is a whole thing on AI. AI
[26:45] is dominating this rally in the US. It's
[26:47] dominating the US economy far more than
[26:49] people realize. I will say it right now.
[26:52] The US economy cannot go down based on
[26:54] the way that AI is having an impact. And
[26:56] no economists have any impact how to
[26:59] deal with it right now. Even the Fed,
[27:02] anyone in in uh government statistics
[27:05] doesn't know how to measure the benefits
[27:06] of it. It is having a huge impact
[27:09] because it is impacting profit margins.
[27:11] There's an arbitrage I'll highlight and
[27:12] there's a tremendous amount of capex.
[27:14] It's what makes it really difficult.
[27:15] It's not great for jobs. I'll go through
[27:17] that thing. He highlights in here that
[27:19] I've circled is just a relative PE. You
[27:21] have to see where it is now. It's come
[27:23] all the way back down. It's lower than
[27:24] where it was. So, he's basically going
[27:27] through there talking about how AI right
[27:29] now makes so much sense. And he talks
[27:32] about this that if you think you're
[27:33] looking at just relative PE multiples,
[27:36] it's the wrong way to look. And this
[27:37] gets into the profit margins of the US
[27:39] and the return on equity. So if you go
[27:41] through his thing, he's basically saying
[27:43] anyone just using pees to have a
[27:45] justification for why they would buy
[27:46] Europe or the rest of the world over the
[27:48] US, not a good argument. Um he does very
[27:51] well in terms of going through it. And
[27:53] again, he at the beginning of the year
[27:55] was saying there should be a rotation,
[27:57] but now he's saying the AI stuff just
[27:59] continues to come through. Uh, another
[28:01] good podcast to listen to, uh, Louis
[28:03] Gav, who I really like from Gavcol. He
[28:06] was on Macro Voices, uh, worth listening
[28:09] to. Uh, here are the highlights, but I
[28:12] think the most important thing that he
[28:13] talked about, which I agree with as
[28:15] well, is this whole thing about why the
[28:17] US is going to have trouble in the
[28:19] public equity markets as time goes on
[28:20] and why AI is not a positive for the US
[28:22] equity market. And I'm not going to read
[28:25] all of this on here, but I'm going to
[28:27] remind people that the US dominated and
[28:30] took this position in terms of the
[28:32] capital markets and the capital flows
[28:34] because we had a moat. We owned coding.
[28:38] Coding was the key thing. He does not
[28:40] specifically mention coding. He talks
[28:42] about the fact that we had an energy
[28:43] boom which he's making an argument now
[28:45] we're at a deficit side where we're
[28:47] trying to do the AI but we're not we
[28:48] haven't built as much of the energy
[28:50] necessary for it and we're running into
[28:53] problems in terms of gas production. So
[28:55] he goes through this but this who wins
[28:57] the AI race which is going to be global
[29:00] and disrupted which is what Pomp and I
[29:02] went through is the difference. We're
[29:04] not there yet. I'll highlight why.
[29:06] Palunteer on fire again. AI is leading
[29:09] the trade high. US corporate
[29:11] profitability remains unusually high.
[29:13] Goldman Sachs, again, we're way above
[29:16] history's and the earnings period just
[29:17] came out. Big tech is a big reason for
[29:20] it. Their net income margins are at a
[29:21] record of the last 20 years and I expect
[29:23] them to expand even more with
[29:27] AI. I don't, but we'll get to that.
[29:30] Cisco reported earnings this week again
[29:33] talking about AI and how much it's
[29:36] benefiting their business. Coreweave
[29:38] IPO, which nobody wanted during the
[29:40] melee. Stock is up 50% since then, if
[29:43] not more. Um, they blew away numbers as
[29:47] well. Uh, Meta came out with a whole
[29:50] bunch of things about how it's going to
[29:51] benefit them and where they're going to
[29:52] see the profit margins going through. I
[29:55] wrote this uh one of the more important
[29:57] pieces I wrote. Um, we're at the
[29:59] inflection point for inference. I'm not
[30:01] going to go through this on there. You
[30:02] guys can reach out to 22vresearch.com.
[30:05] Um I went through and the only thing I
[30:07] want to make sure I highlight in this is
[30:11] this part key statements highlighting
[30:12] the inference boom which is happening
[30:14] right now. Inference is a major part of
[30:16] driving what's going on with the
[30:18] semiconductors. Uh I don't there's just
[30:21] so much demand right now in terms of
[30:22] what's going through but all you have to
[30:24] do is go back to what Sacha Nadella said
[30:26] inference usage has grown five-fold
[30:28] year-over-year. You want to invest in
[30:29] things that have grown fivefold
[30:31] year-over-year with over 100 trillion
[30:33] tokens and most importantly including a
[30:36] record 50 in March alone. So think about
[30:38] the compounding what's going on. This
[30:41] was the benefit of deepseek. This is
[30:43] what he meant when he talked about uh
[30:47] Jevans paradox back in January when
[30:49] Deepseek came out and everyone said no
[30:50] no no this is bad for semis. This is bad
[30:53] for everything.
[30:55] Every company that is mentioned here was
[30:57] directly quoted with talking about how
[30:59] inference is growing rapidly right now.
[31:03] All of these companies I could give you
[31:05] another 20 that I didn't include here.
[31:07] Some of which I included in the paper.
[31:09] This is the main thing and this is
[31:11] before we get into the embodiment side.
[31:15] The AI native phones, the AI native
[31:18] computers, full self-driving, humanoids,
[31:20] everything is coming. It is massive for
[31:23] inference demand. AI's trillion dollar
[31:25] opportunity. Sequoa did u a keynote
[31:28] speech worth listening to as well to
[31:30] again stay on top of how AI is going
[31:32] through it. These are some of the the
[31:35] details on it. You guys can pause and go
[31:37] look at it on your own. Now, Sequoia
[31:39] made a lot of press two years ago. It's
[31:41] been two years already when they said
[31:43] the AI bubble is reaching a tipping
[31:44] point. Navigating what comes next will
[31:46] be essential. So the same group that
[31:48] said AI 600 billion question um is
[31:51] talking about the opportunities that are
[31:53] coming. Now that 600 billion question I
[31:56] believe in I believe that's a problem.
[31:59] This is the capex illusion. How spending
[32:01] today distorts profit margin. So I
[32:03] worked with chat GPT and I just asked it
[32:05] the simple question. So a major driver
[32:08] of S&P's profit margins is the massive
[32:10] capital spending by the mag 7. So they
[32:12] are writing checks. So let's make this
[32:14] simple. 300 billion in capex is real
[32:16] cash out the door. It doesn't
[32:18] immediately hit their income statements
[32:19] as an expense because it's depreciated
[32:22] slowly over time. At the same time, the
[32:25] firms receiving that 300 billion,
[32:27] notably Nvidia, Broadcom, blah blah,
[32:29] they book the revenue immediately. In
[32:31] the case of Nvidia, they have lots of
[32:33] receivables. They haven't even produced
[32:34] what they bought. I don't want to say
[32:37] this is a scam, but I'm just saying
[32:39] profit margins are elevated in the S&P.
[32:41] That's all well and good as long as the
[32:44] ROI comes back. So, as long as the
[32:46] return on investment from AI actually
[32:48] materializes through the MAG7 because
[32:50] they're the ones doing the spending or
[32:52] seeing it in some other place, that's
[32:54] great. I don't think that's going to
[32:56] happen. So, their warning was that the
[32:59] amount of revenue, incremental revenue
[33:01] was massive. 600 to 8 billion in annual
[33:04] revenue. Do I think they're going to get
[33:06] revenue? Yes. Do I think it's going to
[33:08] be as big as what's
[33:09] necessary in three years? I think it's
[33:11] going to be a problem. In the meantime,
[33:12] I think multiples are going to have
[33:14] trouble. Um, big tech jobs, amazing, no
[33:19] job growth. Look at this. Year-over-year
[33:21] changing combined headcount. These guys
[33:23] are trying to make margins by not hiring
[33:26] people. This is the negative side for
[33:28] jobs. It's not that big because again,
[33:31] as I've said to many, many people, only
[33:33] the S&P 500 are able to accomplish this.
[33:36] Small businesses can't. They don't have
[33:38] the infrastructure. They don't have a
[33:41] tech culture. They don't even use AI.
[33:43] Startups will, but it's going to take a
[33:45] long time for them. They're the ones
[33:47] that will disrupt these companies. But
[33:48] in the meantime, they ain't hiring
[33:50] anyone. And so, who's seeing it? And why
[33:52] is the economy so bifrocated? New
[33:54] college grads face a tough job market.
[33:56] Again, it's getting harder and harder.
[33:58] So, I just want to highlight this
[34:00] because the reason I do this with
[34:02] Anthony Pompiano, it's not just that I
[34:05] believe in Bitcoin. And the reason I
[34:06] believe in Bitcoin is because of
[34:07] artificial intelligence and because the
[34:09] macroeconomy is going through what what
[34:11] Russell Napier talked about. I cannot
[34:13] say this loud enough to all hedge fund
[34:15] people. This is your world, the public
[34:17] markets. This number is going to
[34:19] continue to decline. This number is
[34:22] going to go up. And this was from Apollo
[34:25] talking about it mainly for the the
[34:26] corporate side. We've seen it happening
[34:28] in fixed income. We're going to see it
[34:30] in equities as well. Stripe, I showed
[34:32] this last week. This is how fast now
[34:34] companies are growing to 5 million RR
[34:38] new AI companies 9 months old SAS
[34:40] companies from the last time more than
[34:43] 37 24 for the first round of AI
[34:46] companies now we're down to nine this is
[34:47] the compounding side pomp is invested in
[34:51] many of these the reason we get along
[34:53] and we did this video on this is because
[34:55] people don't ever see this these are not
[34:57] things that Andre and Harvitz get
[34:59] involved in they can't and the reason
[35:00] they can't for the most part these are
[35:02] small businesses, they don't need the
[35:04] capital with AI. This is completely
[35:06] changing the capital of the future.
[35:09] Hence, Micro Strategy. Good thing Jim
[35:11] Chenos has decided he knows so much
[35:13] about Bitcoin and so much about the
[35:14] future of the capital structure and what
[35:16] it's going to look like over some guy
[35:17] who's been spending every day for the
[35:19] last 5 years on it. Please, people, go
[35:22] read about it. Go learn about what's
[35:24] going on and spend the time. You can't
[35:26] sit here and cover these stupid
[35:27] businesses anymore where 90% of them are
[35:31] already going out of business. Amazon
[35:33] destroyed them. Now it's going to be
[35:34] private markets that are going to
[35:35] describe them. You can doubt it as much
[35:37] as you want. AI is going to bring that.
[35:39] This is the reason why faster adoption,
[35:41] no friction. I say it all the time. The
[35:43] number one friction for a company to use
[35:45] AI, human beings. Human beings are the
[35:48] friction. They refuse to it. I saw it at
[35:50] my hedge fund. I've seen it all over the
[35:51] place. They either don't believe it,
[35:53] they believe it's hype, they won't go
[35:54] through it. This number tells you the
[35:56] facts. This is just BS. It's like hedge
[35:59] fund or economists telling you there's
[36:01] going to be a recession. Do the
[36:03] homework. Start listening to things that
[36:05] matter and don't listen to old people
[36:07] telling you the world's going to fall
[36:08] apart because of tariffs. It just
[36:10] doesn't work that way. Sam Alman's
[36:12] predictions in AI. You can go read them
[36:14] for yourself. But again, there's a ton
[36:15] of stuff going on right now and it's
[36:17] accelerating and compounding at
[36:19] compounding at a fast pace. Alon Musk
[36:22] was interviewed. Every time Alon Musk
[36:23] gets interviewed, you want to listen,
[36:24] even if it's just to hear the Delta
[36:26] change in terms of what they've seen.
[36:28] That's why I listen to Eric Schmidt.
[36:29] It's why I listen to Mo Gadwat. That's
[36:30] why I listen to every single AI person
[36:33] and occasionally to historians and
[36:35] occasionally to market people because I
[36:37] care about the sentiment and I care
[36:38] about where people are. Right now,
[36:39] they're worried about the hard data
[36:42] showing a recession. So, if the data is
[36:44] stubbornly not going to go down and the
[36:46] soft data goes back up, then the market
[36:48] should have a bid to it. And then once
[36:50] everyone believes that the economy is
[36:51] fine, the rates and the dollars will
[36:53] matter. Go listen to Alon Musk. He's
[36:55] going to give you some details on
[36:56] humanoids. Big big uh breakthrough in
[36:59] math. For all the quants out there who
[37:02] are running a quant portfolio, Alpha
[37:04] Evolve is now competition. Uh just the
[37:08] math side of this is going so rapidly
[37:10] and again it's getting cheaper and
[37:12] cheaper. If you haven't seen this video
[37:14] with Optimus, you have to go watch it.
[37:16] You can go see it on anything, but just
[37:18] go watch the video to see how far the
[37:20] humanoids are. Uh, at this point,
[37:23] Walgreens says using robots to fill
[37:25] prescriptions helped save $500
[37:28] million. France wants to roll out robot
[37:31] army by 2040. Again, that's 15 years
[37:34] from now. 15 years ago is later than the
[37:38] great financial crisis.
[37:40] Uh, Bitcoin, we're consolidating right
[37:43] near the all-time highs, the way it
[37:45] seems to always. There's a lot of short
[37:47] options out here that expire at the end
[37:49] of May. Uh, one of two things are going
[37:51] to happen. Uh, Nvidia happens to happen
[37:54] right around expiration in terms of
[37:57] their earnings. The I think expiration
[37:58] the big one is the 30th. You've got 28th
[38:02] on Nvidia earnings. If Nvidia comes
[38:04] through and beats and gets a spike up on
[38:08] the back of the inference stuff, I would
[38:09] expect that Bitcoin is going to go
[38:11] higher. That could be the beginning of
[38:12] what I'm expecting, which is a short
[38:14] squeeze. Uh Eric Trump says sovereign
[38:16] wealth funds, family offices and
[38:17] corporates and a race to the top. We
[38:19] continue to see the adoption going. Uh
[38:22] UBS, I remember I was at a conference
[38:24] talking about Bitcoin UBS in 22 and the
[38:28] guy said we would never do anything on
[38:30] Bitcoin. Asia's wealthy shifting from
[38:32] dollar to crypto and
[38:34] gold. China says UBS. Uh oh. Chinese
[38:38] textile company will issue up to issue
[38:42] stock to buy 8,000 Bitcoin for 800
[38:44] million. More people doing Michael
[38:46] Sailor. Hong Kong based investment firm
[38:48] disclosed owning close to a billion
[38:50] dollars of ETF. The Asian Money will be
[38:54] looking for a home outside of the
[38:55] system. Uh if you haven't seen this
[38:57] company, go look at the stock in it.
[38:59] It's the Blockchain Group. It's in
[39:01] France. Uh obviously a good performing
[39:03] stock. Uh, Nakamoto, they're gonna do
[39:07] they're gonna do we're Micro Strategy
[39:08] Square. They're going to issue uh some
[39:11] converts to go buy more Bitcoin. It's
[39:14] got to be a bubble. I mean, look how
[39:15] many companies are doing it. This has
[39:17] got to be a bubble. I mean, how how long
[39:18] is this going to go on that that people
[39:20] are going to say this? Um, stable coin
[39:22] usage. I've talked about how stable
[39:24] coins are the network effects. It gets
[39:25] the system going. The more stable coins,
[39:27] the more wallets, the more wallets, the
[39:29] more money goes into the assets. It's
[39:30] outperforming all assets. uh when nobody
[39:32] owns it in terms of anyone that has any
[39:34] money. You will continue to see this
[39:35] around the globe, especially now that
[39:37] people don't want to hold dollars the
[39:39] way that they used to. Uh they still
[39:40] want them in those countries relative to
[39:42] their own uh currencies, but they won't
[39:44] ever own stocks if they're below the age
[39:46] of 35. So, their choice for investments
[39:48] is Bitcoin. You'll continue to get that.
[39:50] Um PayPal now has 434 million customers.
[39:54] They are making it very easy to invest
[39:57] in these things. You will continue to
[40:00] have more and more. Coinbase joined the
[40:02] S&P
[40:04] 500. Regulatory side, we finally got SEC
[40:07] Paul Atkins and they're focused on
[40:10] making the US the crypto capital of the
[40:11] world. First thing that needs to get
[40:13] done is the stable coin thing. I
[40:14] mentioned last week the Democrats are
[40:16] killing themselves. they uh refused to
[40:18] put the bit stable coin bill in and I
[40:20] said that they would come under pressure
[40:22] and so fair shake a massive super PAC is
[40:25] now warning for the Senate basically
[40:27] saying okay the crypto community needs
[40:30] clear responsible rules of the road
[40:31] further delays put American
[40:33] competitiveness and consumers at risk
[40:35] this is part of our country it's part of
[40:38] what's going on and what happens
[40:39] cryptoback stablecoin bill gets
[40:41] bipartisan push for quick revival in
[40:43] Senate the push back came uh the the
[40:46] super PAC did its job. Uh JP Morgan says
[40:50] Bitcoin out outpaced gold in 2025.
[40:52] Remember JP Morgan has Jaime Diamond who
[40:54] says this is rat poison or whatever. Now
[40:57] that was Charlie Munger. He says this is
[40:59] a scam. This is only for drug dealers.
[41:01] It doesn't work. You can't do it. And
[41:04] part of the reason is it's very exposed
[41:06] to quantum as a hack. And I'll end it on
[41:09] this because gold was hacked this week.
[41:12] Uh CERN just turned lead into gold. and
[41:16] watched it vanish. But we will, I've
[41:18] said at every speech I've given when
[41:19] people have brought up the quantum side,
[41:21] I'm like, we will eventually be able to
[41:23] make gold just like look what's happened
[41:26] to the diamond market. That's it for me
[41:29] this week. I'll see you next week.
