--------------------------------------------------

[00:02] um we've hit an inflection point in my
[00:04] opinion. Uh and from this point over the
[00:07] course of the next week or two, I think
[00:10] uh with where the market stands and as I
[00:12] go through this, the market is basically
[00:15] now reached a point where this is going
[00:17] to start to uh accelerate in terms of uh
[00:21] news on the
[00:23] unintended consequences from the the
[00:25] tariff situation. So this whole video is
[00:28] about making sure that we pay attention
[00:31] to the fact that uh it's a levered Ponzi
[00:34] scheme and right now the deleveraging
[00:37] which is happening each week uh is
[00:40] starting to impact liquidity. It is
[00:43] starting to cause more pressure on the
[00:45] administration in terms of coming to a
[00:47] quicker decision uh whether it's the
[00:49] economy, whether it's the uh markets
[00:52] expectations of inflations from the
[00:54] tariffs. uh multiple points of the
[00:57] economy are starting to get weaker and
[00:58] so I want to go through that uh and just
[01:01] you know towards the sentiment has
[01:03] obviously continued to worsen but I had
[01:05] a lot of conversations this week and I
[01:07] think people are um getting too much
[01:10] into the where the economy is going to
[01:11] end up extrapolating the tariffs and
[01:14] we're still in a point where you have to
[01:16] put probabilities on whether the
[01:18] administration is going to be able to
[01:20] keep continuing with this or whether as
[01:22] I'm saying their pressure is building
[01:24] for an off-ramp. So, uh we'll go through
[01:27] this uh one by one. Uh for the week, S&P
[01:32] was down one and a half% quiet week
[01:34] after the last two ones. So, things had
[01:37] kind of settled down. Same thing went
[01:39] for the bond market. Yields did come
[01:41] down after the historic rise last week.
[01:43] It was uh you know lower volatility uh
[01:46] and we came down 16 basis
[01:48] points. Same thing goes for the currency
[01:51] market. Dollar remains weak. Um but you
[01:54] know last week we had that historic fall
[01:57] in terms of uh treasuries uh I did this
[02:01] chart to just show that uh treasuries in
[02:03] euro terms. So if you're a European
[02:05] investor that invested in long-term
[02:07] treasuries uh you were down 10% in a
[02:10] week. You can see you know where that
[02:12] went. But uh this whole thing of dollar
[02:14] going lower with assets going lower the
[02:16] dollar has been a major part of this. So
[02:18] uh BFA came out with their fund manager
[02:20] survey. investors haven't been this
[02:22] bearish in 30 years. Uh here's basically
[02:27] uh their sentiment measure when they
[02:30] combine growth expectations, cash and
[02:32] equity allocations. Uh and Michael
[02:35] Hartrick just Hartnik basically said now
[02:37] contrarian trades are long US stocks, US
[02:39] dollar global cyclicals, short gold,
[02:42] bonds defensive. So, if this is where
[02:44] everyone is positioned, uh, we have to
[02:46] spend time on again what started last
[02:49] week and what I'll continue to say, uh,
[02:51] the administration and in particular
[02:53] Scott Besson who seems to have moved to
[02:54] the front seat of the car while Howard
[02:57] Lutnik and Peter Navaro have moved to
[02:58] the backseat of the car. Uh, Besson on
[03:02] Monday gave an interview in Buenazeris.
[03:04] If you haven't watched it, it's worth
[03:05] watching. I think every time he speaks
[03:07] now in long form, more than 10, 15
[03:09] minutes, you want to pay attention to
[03:11] what he's saying. Uh but he basically
[03:14] said if we measure uncertainty by the
[03:15] VIX, I don't want to make market calls,
[03:17] but it seems the VIX has spike and
[03:18] likely peak. Well, that would be an
[03:20] indication again from the administration
[03:22] that the second derivative of policy uh
[03:25] has shifted and they've acknowledged
[03:27] that the unintended consequences of the
[03:29] market uh probably got away with them
[03:32] and the reason is because of the
[03:33] Treasury market. And so he did say in
[03:35] there uh in that interview that Treasury
[03:38] could increase buyback buybacks of off
[03:40] the run securities if needed stabilized
[03:42] markets. The reason this is important
[03:44] and it was reiterated this uh the next
[03:47] day uh about uh from the deputy
[03:50] secretary. This is just best and again
[03:51] it has a toolkit specifically if needed
[03:55] and then Michael Falender uh spoke again
[04:00] on Tuesday after that interview uh
[04:03] basically talking about how they are
[04:04] discussing the supplementary leverage
[04:06] ratios application. The reason this is
[04:08] important is because at the end of the
[04:09] day, if they do things to slow the
[04:11] economy, as I've said repeatedly,
[04:13] they're going to have to come in with
[04:14] some sort of liquidity. Once they start
[04:16] providing liquidity to the market, the
[04:18] market knows that this that they're
[04:21] going to try and do something where
[04:22] they're going to provide money to keep
[04:24] things stable. And I think you should
[04:26] realize that that is what has to happen
[04:27] with leverage and debt to GDP this high
[04:30] is that if you're going to do things
[04:31] that freeze the economy like it was in
[04:34] Lehman, like it was in COVID, like it
[04:36] was briefly during uh Silicon Valley
[04:38] Bank when deposits were leaving, they
[04:40] have to create liquidity facilities or
[04:42] come up with something. Everyone's
[04:43] focused on Fed rate cuts. That is
[04:45] totally irrelevant. We're at the point
[04:47] now where in my opinion uh the printing
[04:49] press is being revved up and that's why
[04:51] you have to pay attention to what Besson
[04:53] said. The reason the printing press has
[04:54] to be uh revved up is that money's
[04:57] leaving the system. So just like if it
[04:59] was uh money leaving a hedge fund that
[05:02] has quarterly uh quarterly liquidity,
[05:05] the market is seizing up as we speak. Um
[05:08] when the top end of the capital
[05:10] structure has no liquidity, you have to
[05:12] go through and look all if people want
[05:14] to sell something right now there is no
[05:17] liquidity. So Muhammad Alan put this out
[05:19] from the FT article. Liquidity worsens
[05:21] in the 29 trillion treasury market as
[05:23] volatility soarses. Analyst JP Morgan
[05:25] said market depth a measure of market's
[05:26] ability to absorge large trades without
[05:28] significant shifts in price had
[05:30] significantly worsens worsened this
[05:32] week. This is where we are. Um it's
[05:35] showing up in all parts of the market.
[05:38] If you need to move a lot of money and
[05:40] there's something going on, which is
[05:41] when people typically need. So if the US
[05:44] says they're breaking off conversations
[05:45] with China and 10 uh $10 billion comes
[05:48] to the market, there is no liquidity on
[05:50] the other side at this point. So having
[05:52] grown up in emerging markets, uh when
[05:54] the tide of liquidity goes out the door
[05:56] or if you're in a movie theater and
[05:58] someone screams fire, the door has
[06:00] gotten very close, very small right now
[06:02] for people to get out. So how important
[06:04] is the treasury market? It provides the
[06:06] benchmark risk-free yield curve for
[06:08] pricing risky assets. So if that's not
[06:11] there, then this is what happens. loan
[06:13] and bond markets sealed tight by the
[06:14] tariff. So you get to see the issuance
[06:17] in leverage loans. That was an FTE
[06:20] article. US leverage loan issuance
[06:22] drought is about to set a record. It did
[06:23] set a record. Longest run of having
[06:25] none. Um
[06:28] and junk bonds, one deal since April.
[06:31] There were two um two uh deals last week
[06:34] in terms of buyout deals. The banks got
[06:36] hung with the
[06:38] debt. Sometimes the music just stops.
[06:40] That's what's happening is liquidity is
[06:42] is falling off. Uh Torstston
[06:45] uh put out this uh just the gap between
[06:48] liquid and illquid bonds is particularly
[06:49] noteworthy. In 2020 the bid ass spread
[06:51] widen across the whole market but this
[06:53] time around transaction costs have
[06:55] increased materially more for off therun
[06:57] paper. You're basically this is in the
[06:59] IG market. Remember this is this was a
[07:02] historic situation and this is what's
[07:04] happening now. So, you're seeing this
[07:05] across the marketplace in the S&P uh
[07:08] median S&P stock bid as ASP spread has
[07:10] gone up to COVID levels. Uh Russell
[07:14] 3,000
[07:16] liquidity and the repo overnight repo uh
[07:21] facility uh drain this week. We finally
[07:24] got down uh we've been doing QT. You've
[07:27] been having money leave. The demand for
[07:29] cash is getting higher and higher and
[07:31] it's getting harder and harder to find
[07:33] and swap spreads which had this shocking
[07:36] move uh last week have sat down there.
[07:39] So you haven't had the repair things
[07:41] have just calmed down in terms of the
[07:43] tariff week. Uh you know I'm not going
[07:46] to go through all these in details
[07:47] because it's just a constant uh back and
[07:49] forth. Uh they're clearly using great
[07:52] deals as a way to keep people from
[07:55] selling. As of right now, it's working.
[07:58] Uh but now and now it's becoming, okay,
[08:00] show us a deal. We're getting sick of
[08:03] words. And I think that's where the
[08:04] market was uh on Friday. Uh you would
[08:08] think that going ahead of a 3-day
[08:10] weekend where this was kind of thrown
[08:11] out there that people the market would
[08:13] rally on fears uh that there'd be
[08:15] positive news. This was a massive trend
[08:18] that went on during the great financial
[08:19] crisis as people thought there'd be a
[08:21] bank bailout every single weekend and
[08:23] positive news and new stimulus measures.
[08:25] So the market would trade up into Friday
[08:26] and then sell back off on Monday and
[08:28] Tuesday. We didn't get the rally on on
[08:31] Friday. Uh we are significantly still
[08:34] off the lows, but uh it was a little
[08:36] surprising and I just show it just shows
[08:38] the fact that buyers uh are not even
[08:40] coming to cover shorts at this point. Uh
[08:42] which we have a lot of shorts out in the
[08:44] marketplace. Uh just in terms of if you
[08:46] didn't see this uh on China's uh white
[08:48] paper, I just think it's important to to
[08:52] recognize that I I do think that there's
[08:54] a high probability uh of an off-ramp uh
[08:57] that is going to happen and I think
[09:00] they'll find a way to get something
[09:01] done. But uh it's it's kind of in
[09:04] China's hands at this point uh as to
[09:07] when it is and whether they want to
[09:08] extract more pain because I think the
[09:10] short-term pain right now uh of the US
[09:12] market is starting to show up. It is
[09:14] showing up in China too as I go through
[09:15] this. But I think if they wanted to take
[09:18] this to the very end, they're going to
[09:19] have to come up with some hope in the
[09:21] marketplace and a pause because each day
[09:24] that the tariffs at the level they are,
[09:26] it's starting to put businesses out in
[09:29] both parts of the
[09:30] world. Uh yeah, doing just uh the
[09:35] repercussions of the strategy are going
[09:37] to take months to come through. And
[09:39] that's really what it is. If these
[09:41] tariffs stay at these levels, as I go
[09:42] through the details, you're already
[09:44] seeing the trade situation uh spiral.
[09:47] And so you will start to get some job
[09:49] losses. I think that's going to show up.
[09:51] Uh and that'll start to freak people
[09:53] out. The inflation side, too. Charles
[09:55] Gasparino and people that I think would,
[09:57] you know, are are heavily in the in the
[10:00] camp of Trump, you're getting more and
[10:02] more pressure, more and more them saying
[10:05] um that the the way they're handling
[10:07] this is just wrong. And I think that's
[10:09] become the common belief is people that
[10:11] were very much in favor of redoing trade
[10:15] have become more negative on the whole
[10:17] situation and you're starting to get
[10:19] pressure on all sides. Uh one thing that
[10:21] was evident to me I went to two
[10:23] breakfasts two dinners uh this week and
[10:26] the sentiment from macro people is just
[10:29] outrageously bearish at this point. Um,
[10:31] and I just wanted to highlight this was
[10:33] this week's podcast uh just from this
[10:35] week that I I listened to and you can
[10:38] see I mean it's it's basically a uh end
[10:42] of the monetary system, death of the US.
[10:45] Everything is about kind of this whole
[10:47] thing of looking at the globe and
[10:49] deciding that the end is here. And I
[10:53] just want to remind everyone that this
[10:55] is exactly what the the administration
[10:59] planned to do. they told they were going
[11:01] to do. Stephen Mirren um here who was
[11:03] interviewed in Bloomberg television is
[11:05] the architect of this entire thing. And
[11:08] if you forgot, here is uh an excerpt
[11:12] from his paper from November. And if you
[11:15] basically go through it, um sweeping
[11:18] tariffs from strong dollar policy can
[11:19] have some of the broadest ramifications
[11:21] of any policy change in decades,
[11:23] reshaping the global and trade and
[11:25] financial system. So when you go back to
[11:26] those podcasts and you listen to them,
[11:29] this is what was intended. Um the
[11:31] intended part was to redo trade because
[11:34] it was unfair. So to say death of US
[11:37] exceptionalism, this is going to lead to
[11:38] massive outflows that'll continue over
[11:40] the course of the next 5 years. Do I
[11:42] think the dollar is going to continue to
[11:44] weaken? Yes. Uh do I think stocks in the
[11:47] US are going to underperform Europe
[11:49] continuously for five years? No. Uh and
[11:52] I don't think this is the end of US
[11:53] exceptionalism. I do think that this was
[11:56] a mispositioning relative to the extreme
[11:59] nature of what they said they were going
[12:00] to do. Um this one is either there's a
[12:03] path by which these policies can be
[12:04] implemented without material adverse
[12:07] consequences but it is narrow and will
[12:09] require cur currency offset for tariffs.
[12:12] So there is a currency offset. The
[12:13] reason that's important um with the
[12:15] dollar going
[12:17] down we might have a uh you know adverse
[12:21] consequences. The question is, are they
[12:22] going to let them become material, or
[12:24] are they going to let GDP come down by a
[12:26] percent or two for the year,
[12:28] frontloading it to where it's going to
[12:30] be down 3 or 4% uh in Q2 because we're
[12:33] going to have significant draw down. I'd
[12:35] be shocked if we didn't have a negative
[12:37] GDP print in Q2 because things are
[12:40] frozen. But people are still spending
[12:42] money. You're not seeing it show up.
[12:43] There haven't been job losses yet. So,
[12:45] as of right now, they have the ability
[12:47] to walk stuff back. What I was saying at
[12:49] the beginning is the pressure to me is
[12:51] growing as I go through this. Um
[12:53] dollar's persistently overvalued. We're
[12:55] taking care of that. You haven't had a
[12:57] significant move in the yuan. So the
[13:00] dollar is weakening. It's not weakening
[13:01] versus the yuan, but the yuan's also not
[13:04] weakening uh and they're not letting it
[13:05] weaken at this point, which I would say
[13:07] is a positive uh in terms of, you know,
[13:10] adding more
[13:12] pressure. Uh everything that was said in
[13:14] here has been done. I do want to just
[13:17] highlight that uh Steven Mirren is not
[13:19] making the final decisions and just
[13:21] listening I hate listening to economists
[13:24] uh and people that yeah I think I think
[13:27] that I think these are just highlights
[13:29] from that interview uh threequarters of
[13:32] jobs created you know sort of government
[13:34] expenditures that's a bunch of BS every
[13:36] time I hear this on the all-in podcast
[13:38] and everything uh it's not government
[13:41] expenditures that have people in this
[13:42] country uh you know 70% % of them uh
[13:46] either pre-diabetic or o or or obese. Uh
[13:49] we need more nurses. We need more health
[13:52] care jobs. And yes, they are subsidized
[13:53] by the government, but uh that's the way
[13:56] the country is. So to include that in
[13:57] there and say that we're going to get
[13:59] through this, that is both a positive
[14:00] for why we're not going to see the job
[14:02] losses that we have in the past because
[14:04] they are still going to be creating
[14:05] quote unquote government jobs because
[14:07] the Medicare Medicaid is not going away
[14:09] uh to help pay for those. but they
[14:11] include it in there and I don't think
[14:13] there will be uh there's going to be
[14:15] material short-term pain. This was not
[14:18] sold to Donald Trump in my opinion that
[14:20] we'd be headed towards a recession that
[14:22] the Treasury market would freeze up at
[14:25] as Brad Gersonner said we still have to
[14:27] finance our national debt. We have $10
[14:29] trillion of treasuries to sell this year
[14:33] and 35% of them are owned by foreign
[14:36] government. So we are still at the point
[14:37] where we could have a failed auction. um
[14:40] they've taken it to that level and I
[14:42] think that needs to be kind of brought
[14:43] in. So what's going on in the US
[14:45] Treasury market and why does it matter?
[14:47] Well, first of all, this has been going
[14:49] on literally since uh Donald Trump, you
[14:53] started to get the acceleration and I
[14:55] want to make sure people realize Trump
[14:56] takes over. Uh this is China's uh gold
[14:59] holdings and this is their treasury
[15:00] holdings. So they've been reducing their
[15:02] treasuries for quite some time now and
[15:04] they've been increasing gold not just
[15:06] because of Donald Trump. Remember this
[15:08] is coming out of his first term. This is
[15:10] preparation to some degree for Trump
[15:12] taking over once it became evident. But
[15:15] also once the US in here decided to
[15:18] weaponize the dollar, the reserve
[15:21] currency status which started with
[15:22] sanctions over Russia, China decided to
[15:25] do what any smart business would do. If
[15:27] you're going to freeze our assets, uh
[15:29] we're going to move as much as we can
[15:31] away from the US. So this has been going
[15:34] on. The pressure has been growing. But
[15:35] there's also another side which is the
[15:38] fiscal and debt side of the US has
[15:41] Moody's the last one not to move it from
[15:43] from AAA rating. Uh we're getting close
[15:48] and I I Moody's is going to downgrade
[15:50] the US maybe this year. Um and part of
[15:52] the issue is because in the US uh since
[15:55] the pandemic, this is just an
[15:57] interesting chart uh that was in the I
[15:59] think it was the IMF uh just yeah no
[16:01] this is the OECD in terms of the global
[16:03] debt report. Uh this just shows how much
[16:06] these are the countries over here
[16:08] largest larger increase in terms of how
[16:10] much became short-term bills. So we've
[16:13] talked about how the US has to borrow in
[16:16] the short term. That is the issue that
[16:17] comes up. So Besson said he didn't want
[16:19] to come to the market and hit the market
[16:22] on the long end with restructuring. Uh
[16:24] he wanted to get the deficit in check.
[16:26] All these master plans, they wanted to
[16:28] have a slowdown in the economy, move the
[16:29] rates lower, and then they could go out
[16:31] and sell 10-year debts uh when yields
[16:33] were in a better position. Well, now
[16:34] you've got yields at the top end of the
[16:36] range, and we have no liquidity left,
[16:39] and the US still has to finance itself
[16:40] with short-term bills, which means
[16:42] rolling them over. So, the situation um
[16:44] in terms of the tariffs and what's
[16:46] happened, there's no way now that they
[16:47] can sell 10-year bonds. There was some
[16:50] talk this week that in the White House
[16:52] the chatter around super bonds is
[16:54] starting to go up as part of the
[16:55] negotiations. I would not be surprised.
[16:57] But in the end, this all ends up being
[16:59] printing. This all figures out some way
[17:01] to deal with a situation that you cannot
[17:03] unwind debt to GDP. And that's why if
[17:05] you want to go read something for
[17:07] everyone who, you know, I've heard I
[17:08] heard an argument this week at a dinner
[17:10] about how we really got out of the debt
[17:12] from World War II, I think people need
[17:14] to go read the International Monetary
[17:16] Forum. It's amazing how many people are
[17:17] quoting history in terms of getting out
[17:19] of debt at a time when we are still
[17:21] printing money. The same people never
[17:23] bring up Bitcoin. They never bring up AI
[17:25] except for bubbles. So, there is an
[17:27] endgame here. My endgame as a macro
[17:29] person is completely different. and it's
[17:30] related to technology, the
[17:32] democratization of AI, uh, and
[17:34] eventually getting to Bitcoin, uh, to
[17:36] deal with productivity. This is the way
[17:38] that people think, which is we have to
[17:40] have a reset or a somewhat of a global
[17:42] recession or a global depression. The
[17:45] problem is we don't have that
[17:47] opportunity. So, just to make sure the
[17:49] numbers are there because we focus too
[17:50] much on the death of US exceptionalism,
[17:52] debt to GDP in the US is 120%. Uh, in
[17:56] terms of public debt, it's above 100% in
[17:59] France. It's above 100% in the UK. It's
[18:01] above 100% in Spain. Who knows where
[18:03] China's is overall, but it's above 100%
[18:06] when you add in everything. The problem
[18:08] is with over hundred trillion dollars of
[18:10] total sovereign and corporate debt
[18:11] worldwide. This is in the Glo OECD
[18:14] global debt report. 40% of it matures by
[18:18] 2027. So, I've talked about an auction
[18:21] failed auction being worse. This is a
[18:22] global problem and it shows up in global
[18:25] yields. So, we focused on US yields
[18:28] moving higher. The white line here is
[18:30] JGB 30-year yields, higher than at any
[18:32] point since 2003 and just continuing to
[18:35] move. Um, you've got UK uh in here.
[18:39] That's where this one is. They're the
[18:40] highest in over 25 years. The US is in
[18:44] here as well. You've got Germany. You've
[18:45] got France. everyone's yields have moved
[18:48] higher and they've been moving higher
[18:49] for quite some time postcoid because of
[18:52] the debt that we've taken on the balance
[18:53] sheet. So the global uh trade
[18:56] restructuring, it's not a US death. It's
[18:58] everyone in the exact same game. And so
[19:01] to sit there and use the headline of
[19:04] that is there a repatriation
[19:06] internationalism. Yes. And that is the
[19:08] point of what getting rid of the reserve
[19:11] currency in the state. It is of taking
[19:13] the negative side of it is we're we want
[19:15] to reduce the trade side. We want to
[19:17] change everything. And so this is a
[19:19] global situation. And I only bring that
[19:21] up because everyone has to come to the
[19:23] table. It's been too focused on from the
[19:25] US perspective as as the problem. This
[19:28] is a global problem that needs to be
[19:29] dealt with and it was going to be dealt
[19:31] with either in this way or is going to
[19:32] be dealt with with Treasury market
[19:34] failures, bond auction failures which
[19:36] would spread around the globe and the
[19:37] pressure would start to intensify
[19:39] because rates are already moving higher.
[19:41] So something needs to be done and I
[19:42] think a rebalancing with some kind of
[19:44] agreement will give people time. But in
[19:46] the end, the only way to deal with this
[19:47] is to continue to print money. Uh
[19:50] because you're that's what democracies
[19:52] end up doing is if you don't do it, then
[19:54] we'll vote in someone that's going to
[19:55] help the people. Uh
[19:57] Jerome Powell, I don't need to go
[20:00] through this whole thing, but people
[20:02] want him
[20:03] to cut rates. Uh I just don't think it
[20:07] matters whether he wants to do it or
[20:09] not. But obviously, this was a big thing
[20:11] for the market in terms of hearing it.
[20:13] uh he did mention that uh on tariffs the
[20:16] current tariffs under consideration
[20:17] which again are the China ones are
[20:19] larger than Smoot Holly tariffs and
[20:21] these are fundamental changes so
[20:23] everyone's trying to adjust to what's
[20:25] going on. Uh Trump of course was angry
[20:28] and basically started saying he wants to
[20:30] get rid of them and too late Jerome Pal
[20:32] and so now you have uh a Treasury market
[20:35] which already has no liquidity and now
[20:37] you have threats about firing the
[20:39] central bank president. Again this is
[20:41] emerging market stuff. This is 100% what
[20:44] I used to see in my days in emerging
[20:46] market. Uh Bessant is privately urging
[20:49] caution and trying to be in there and
[20:51] just saying how bad it would be uh at a
[20:54] time when we don't have the opportunity.
[20:56] So demanding that rates get lower and it
[20:59] becomes the blame game at this point in
[21:00] terms of what's happening. Uh I just
[21:02] think the pressure is growing and this
[21:04] is where this week uh at the end of the
[21:07] week or at the uh end of last week uh
[21:10] White House National Economic Council
[21:12] Director Kevin Hasset dismissed the idea
[21:14] of a recession looming this year. Uh
[21:17] this is where the pressure is starting
[21:19] to come. So I've said before they can't
[21:22] have a recession with a fiscal problem
[21:24] this big. And the reason is Torson
[21:25] Sllock went through this. Uh so everyone
[21:28] who's like well the he's going to do
[21:29] this intentionally to get us into a
[21:31] recession and then have this you know
[21:33] grand plan to come out of it. The
[21:35] problem is and this is what he brings up
[21:38] the negative impact of a budget deficit
[21:40] during a recession far
[21:44] outweighs two percentage point decline
[21:46] in rates which was kind of the game that
[21:48] they thought they wanted which is let's
[21:50] lower rates. I hear this on the All-In
[21:52] podcast too. And then we can refinance
[21:54] our debt, which is just insane um in
[21:58] terms of long-term rates because most of
[22:00] the debt we have is short-term rates.
[22:02] And if the Fed's not cutting, it doesn't
[22:03] really matter. But this is on average
[22:05] how much you lose in terms of your
[22:08] receipts, particularly when 25% of
[22:12] revenues coming in the door are related
[22:14] to the stock market, uh is 1.3 trillion.
[22:18] So, okay, let's lower rates to
[22:20] refinance, but then we go through it.
[22:21] cannot get out of this problem with a
[22:23] recession when the deficit is this big.
[22:25] But that's what we're starting to get
[22:27] to. So here is the uh manufacturing data
[22:30] started to come out this week. This will
[22:31] all highlight just what's happening on
[22:33] the trade and the manufacturing side. Uh
[22:35] this was from the empire. Uh this is the
[22:38] new orders side looking out six months.
[22:41] So we had seen you know improvements
[22:43] going in after the
[22:45] election expectations and now we've gone
[22:47] down to levels uh of the great financial
[22:50] crisis. Philly Fed showed the same
[22:55] thing between the Philly Fed and
[22:57] manufacturing. It's your first look uh
[23:00] for the month on the data of what's
[23:02] happening this month. So it actually
[23:04] came in at a minus
[23:06] 26.4 versus estimates of 2.2. So a
[23:10] massive drop off from of 38 points 39
[23:13] points. Earnings revisions for com for
[23:16] S&P 500 firms uh continue to move
[23:18] sharply lower.
[23:20] Again very uh similar point
[23:23] to the shutdown of the economy on a
[23:26] global basis. These are global um
[23:29] revisions which uh are continuing to go
[23:31] lower. So this is a weekly number and we
[23:35] had a massive move lower at the
[23:36] beginning of April. It's continuing.
[23:37] This is usually associated very closely
[23:39] with the manufacturing side within the
[23:42] market. Um, you know, the S&P is has
[23:45] bounced off the lows and is back up
[23:47] here, but we got the what I use as the
[23:50] benchmark for when the economy has
[23:52] actually hit a level that um is fine.
[23:55] The alarming part should be for people
[23:57] that the reason I brought this up is we
[23:59] made new lows in the equal weight
[24:01] consumer discretionary versus consumer
[24:03] staples. Uh, so the economy, the way
[24:05] they're discounting it from the
[24:06] consumer, continues to collapse. Last
[24:08] time we saw anything like this, we saw
[24:10] this bounce here in 22. We saw this come
[24:13] down and make new lows and eventually
[24:14] the S&P followed. If this doesn't turn
[24:16] back higher, which is only going to
[24:18] happen if we get any kind of significant
[24:20] improvement in uh in tariff or liquidity
[24:25] comes and changes the picture here. If
[24:27] not, the S&P is going to go retest the
[24:29] lows uh shortly uh just because the
[24:33] economy is freezing and there's been no
[24:36] response yet. So, in terms of the
[24:38] economy and how quickly it's freezing
[24:39] up, Ryan Peterson should be on your must
[24:42] uh actually the two people I'll do,
[24:43] Craig Fuller and Ryan Peterson should be
[24:45] on your must uh watch thing. Anthony
[24:48] Pompiano and I talked both talked about
[24:50] them this week as the two people and
[24:53] that's because trade has become the most
[24:54] important thing. uh which means shipping
[24:56] has and Ryan Peterson runs I believe
[24:58] it's flexport uh but he will tweet and
[25:01] goes through it. So thousands and
[25:02] millions of American small businesses
[25:04] including my account will go bankrupt
[25:05] this year if they don't change. He goes
[25:07] through that was a he's got a long
[25:09] thread. You've got small businesses now
[25:11] reaching out and threatening uh to or
[25:14] suing Trump over the tariff authority.
[25:16] This is the pressure part of things. Uh
[25:18] we're trying to help small businesses
[25:20] across the country and Walmart as
[25:23] always. What happens
[25:25] is Walmart will just keep their prices
[25:28] at the level they were. They will take
[25:29] losses for as long as this goes on.
[25:32] Small businesses won't have the same
[25:33] opportunity. So Trump's master plan of
[25:35] helping small businesses becomes an
[25:37] issue because the bigger places that
[25:39] have access to capital uh and can
[25:42] stockpile stuff. They will just keep
[25:44] their prices down. As small businesses
[25:46] go out of business, Walmart will buy up
[25:48] the inventory from them. uh you just
[25:50] this is not the way to handle things in
[25:52] terms of trying to help out uh smaller
[25:54] businesses. So this is where one of the
[25:56] issues is and this is the part of the
[25:59] thread just to highlight from Ryan
[26:01] Peterson. In the week since tariffs hit
[26:02] ocean freight bookings from China are
[26:03] down 50% across the the industry. Um he
[26:07] goes through
[26:09] and says that's about a trillion dollars
[26:11] of economic activity because of the
[26:13] leverage on this. Meaning there's about
[26:16] 460 to550 billion of Chinese goods.
[26:20] Those Chinese goods come in at uh
[26:22] wholesale prices then they get sold at
[26:25] three times that. That's where his you
[26:26] know trillion dollars of activity is is
[26:29] is wiped out. Um his point is there's
[26:31] leverage in where we get things from
[26:34] China as imports and then what we sell
[26:35] them out here. The transaction costs on
[26:38] that are much higher. Um Craig Fuller,
[26:40] another person on the trucking and
[26:42] shipping side. Many truckers I spoke
[26:43] don't realize how quickly container
[26:45] volumes have collapsed. Uh you're
[26:49] talking about stuff that only compares
[26:50] to CO. Um and you know there's no other
[26:53] way around it. you're going to see a
[26:55] significant uh drop off and already Mac
[26:58] trucks announced layoffs uh in Lehi. So,
[27:02] you're going to start seeing the
[27:03] repercussions in terms of
[27:05] layoffs. And this is the main point that
[27:08] I've said to people and I I really went
[27:10] through it uh at a breakfast. So,
[27:12] historically, when we've gotten up to
[27:14] 50, we did get up to 50 on the VIX. This
[27:16] is a monthly chart. So, now that we've
[27:18] come back down here, this is where it
[27:19] is. But, uh this is overlaid with the
[27:22] weekly jobless claims. And what I said
[27:24] um and what I'll repeat, you know,
[27:26] saying there are no such things as
[27:27] recessions anymore since this period. Uh
[27:30] the economy's changed, the job situation
[27:32] has changed. Every single time we get
[27:35] recession fears, 22, whatever, it's been
[27:38] the jobless claims that have stayed
[27:39] stable that just don't show anything.
[27:41] They've been at the same level here. And
[27:42] remember, this is weekly jobless claims.
[27:45] The US population from this point to
[27:47] here has increased and it's clearly
[27:50] increased since here and here. We just
[27:52] the these numbers relative to the size
[27:55] of the economy are minuscule and that's
[27:58] why there there's no such thing when
[28:00] nurses are not losing their job because
[28:02] of this. Uh will some truckers lose
[28:04] their jobs? Yes. Will 250 people will
[28:06] they be able to go out and get a job if
[28:07] they want one? Probably. Um the gig
[28:10] economy allows for people to do that.
[28:12] They can't make as much money, but if
[28:13] you can go get another job at Uber
[28:15] tomorrow, you technically have a job.
[28:17] And that's the ability for people to go
[28:19] get jobs. They can't make everything
[28:20] what they were making. It does lead to
[28:22] wage cuts. It does lead to softer
[28:23] employment. I've shown that the economy
[28:26] has seen much softer employment for the
[28:28] last two years since 2022. And that is
[28:30] because the higher rates have hurt
[28:32] smaller businesses. We've seen that with
[28:34] small caps. Now you've got tariffs which
[28:36] again are going to hurt small businesses
[28:38] and lead to more people being forced
[28:40] into this gig
[28:42] economy/conultant type work which is
[28:44] where 50% of the people in the country
[28:46] are. So you have a completely different
[28:47] makeup of the economy, but as long as
[28:50] transactions are happening, you won't
[28:52] see this go higher. The problem is if
[28:54] you freeze it, just like what happened
[28:55] here, you will start to see it inch up.
[28:58] Imports are only 15% of the global
[29:00] economy. So this is not going to freeze
[29:02] the entire thing. But people, if the
[29:04] government's looking and wants to see no
[29:06] job losses, they're going to start
[29:08] seeing some rise in weekly claims every
[29:11] uh week that this continues, I think it
[29:13] will go higher. Here are the claims
[29:15] relative to 2's 10 yield curve. You have
[29:17] the yield curve now steepening which
[29:18] historically has meant we're heading
[29:20] into a recession just like you did in '
[29:22] 07. We ended up in a recession 2000
[29:25] recession in here. 90 we were um in one
[29:28] and already in here. So it's highly
[29:30] likely we're in some sort of a soft
[29:32] recession right now. The question is
[29:34] will they let the jobless claims go
[29:35] higher and become a harder one. Housing
[29:37] market is now forecast to be down by
[29:40] Zillow. This is a dramatic shift from
[29:41] where it was. We've been seeing the
[29:43] housing market soften, but it was
[29:45] localized to parts of the economy that
[29:48] probably had the biggest bubble. Well,
[29:49] now as people are worrying about their
[29:51] jobs, you're going to start to see the
[29:53] housing market become more of a story as
[29:54] well. Um, the bigger pressure to me is
[29:57] going to come from inflation. Uh,
[30:00] everyone has this debate. You're clearly
[30:02] seeing deflation right now terms of the
[30:05] stock market. Uh, but this was a great
[30:07] uh thread or or you know, attend here.
[30:10] Parts of the economy are in a sudden
[30:12] stop. Uh this is what we just went
[30:15] through. Trump has proudly broadcasted
[30:17] the low February and March inflation
[30:20] prints. And today he complained pal was
[30:22] not cutting rates arguing oil and
[30:23] grocery prices are going
[30:26] down. Inflation is what kills
[30:29] politicians. Here is where we have now
[30:31] the fixing run, which basically means
[30:33] the market expectations of where the CPI
[30:37] report release will be for April. So 35
[30:40] basis points 0.35. So let's say you
[30:43] could give a point4 print hanging around
[30:46] a point4 print here and then in June
[30:48] 0.5. So I highlighted these because this
[30:51] is the thing that kills. This would be
[30:53] an annualized rate of 6%. If these come
[30:56] in
[30:57] at 35.35
[31:00] and.5 you're dealing with approximately
[31:02] at this point something that will be
[31:04] close to 526% in terms of an annualized
[31:08] number. And even though they have the
[31:10] forecast coming down, we don't this is
[31:13] not going to be the focus of the market.
[31:14] The market will focus as they have. So
[31:16] the pressure would grow on the inflation
[31:18] side as well. And we already have him
[31:20] losing on pretty much all of now, and
[31:24] this is again the most accurate pollster
[31:26] in 2020 and 2024. You're getting to the
[31:29] point now where on every issue pretty
[31:31] much across the board, uh it's worsening
[31:34] from where it was. And that's kind of
[31:37] the issue as to where going. You have to
[31:40] imagine that immigration has even
[31:42] worsened and this had been a an
[31:44] improving thing in in March. So on the
[31:47] approval side, he's losing things at
[31:49] this point, which means the midterms
[31:51] become a bigger issue. So the economy
[31:53] and the pressure is growing. And that's
[31:55] why as people extrapolate and as you
[31:56] hear all these macro people talk about
[31:58] there's a guaranteed recession, this is
[31:59] what's going to happen. This is what's
[32:00] going to happen. We are at the pressure
[32:02] point now and this is when the
[32:03] administration has to do something. Acid
[32:05] volatility. So I created a new thing the
[32:07] white line here which takes into account
[32:09] fixed income V currency V and equity V
[32:12] as one component um which I think is
[32:14] going to become important and the reason
[32:16] is because the only thing that hasn't
[32:17] moved yet is junk spreads. I mentioned
[32:19] that the market's completely frozen. One
[32:21] of the reasons that junk spreads haven't
[32:22] risen is they can't sell them and they
[32:25] learned in co if you sell them then
[32:26] you're not going to be able to buy them
[32:28] back. Uh so just like it is with labor
[32:30] where they don't want to fire people
[32:32] because it's hard to hire them back. the
[32:33] junk market's there, but you're going to
[32:35] start to see this filter through every
[32:37] week in my opinion. The only question is
[32:39] whether it be small amounts or big
[32:41] amounts. That'll get people more
[32:42] bearish. The issue is we've already seen
[32:45] a second derivative change in policy.
[32:47] We've already seen a second derivative
[32:48] change in terms of how do we deal with
[32:50] the bond market. Uh they're trying to
[32:51] find ways there's talk about them
[32:53] putting together a task force to deal uh
[32:56] with the next couple weeks in terms of
[32:58] the trade side in the event that they
[32:59] can't come to a deal. The main point is
[33:02] for everyone out there, uh, the the the
[33:05] the upside is capped, uh, without trade
[33:09] deals, but at the same point, you're
[33:10] going to have him try to announce things
[33:12] to get people optimistic, but the
[33:14] economy and the pressure from the
[33:16] liquidity in the market is growing every
[33:17] day. Uh, one final thing on this, again,
[33:20] I want to focus on things one year out
[33:22] because even if we do go lower, I don't
[33:25] think they can. I know they can't handle
[33:26] a recession. So, there will be a deal
[33:28] that gets done. The question is, will
[33:30] the deal get done with the S&P at 5,500,
[33:33] 5,300, 5200, 4,000? Um, I still want to
[33:38] be buying dips as opposed to selling
[33:39] rallies, but I want to be buying dips
[33:41] below 5200, closer to 5,000. And I
[33:45] that's where I think investors uh who
[33:47] are looking to put money to work should
[33:49] be looking to do it. terms of the
[33:51] homework that comes in. Uh again, the AI
[33:54] side, this was a big thing. Didn't get a
[33:56] lot of press, but Google came out and
[33:58] said they're still doing their $75
[34:01] billion uh this year in AI. Uh Nvidia
[34:05] bringing uh stuff back to America.
[34:07] Obviously, they were down this week on
[34:09] the back of the $5.5 billion release in
[34:12] terms of the
[34:14] H200s and not being able to do things in
[34:17] China. Uh again all this trade stuff is
[34:20] temporary stuff. I just want to focus on
[34:23] the structural side. Uh Eric Schmidt uh
[34:26] who I always mention on on this uh spoke
[34:29] predicts AI sprint towards super
[34:31] intelligence could put smartest human in
[34:33] every pocket in six years. I want to
[34:35] remind people this because this is where
[34:37] productivity boom happens uh
[34:39] dramatically and that's what's going to
[34:41] happen uh unless we go into a
[34:44] depression. You're gonna have the AI
[34:46] accelerate no matter what. Uh, AI has
[34:49] grown beyond human knowledge, says
[34:51] Google's deep mind
[34:53] unit. A new agentic approach called
[34:55] streams. We'll let AI models learn from
[34:57] the experience of the environment
[34:58] without human prejudgment. Uh, I
[35:01] listened to a podcast with the man with
[35:03] the um I forget his name who spoke about
[35:06] this from Google Deep Mind. It was
[35:08] amazing to listen to just in terms of
[35:10] we've left the LLM side of basically
[35:12] consuming us or human knowledge and now
[35:15] we're getting into the environmental
[35:17] side or the experiential side where it
[35:19] learns from what it's seeing and what
[35:21] it's feeling and that's exactly what is
[35:23] being said here. So the full
[35:26] self-driving
[35:27] uh just cameras and the Tesla chip. So
[35:30] it's learning now through cameras as
[35:33] opposed to sensors. So as opposed to
[35:36] just seeing that a tree is there and
[35:39] knowing that it needs to avoid it, uh
[35:41] it's actually learning and this is an
[35:43] important step in terms of the inference
[35:45] and reasoning side and the ability to
[35:47] take this to the next level for
[35:48] humanoids. Uh one negative and this
[35:51] again is you know in the case of if we
[35:54] want to compete with China uh actuators
[35:57] the muscles of
[35:59] humanoids you can't get them. The
[36:01] Chinese are the only place in the world
[36:03] right now that makes them. So, you're
[36:05] going to have to go backwards in the
[36:07] competition for humanoids, which is not
[36:09] just for, you know, making stuff in your
[36:11] home, but it's also
[36:13] for actually for military and things
[36:15] along those lines. So, uh we've run to a
[36:18] point where you're going to, you know,
[36:20] hurt yourself uh from the trade
[36:22] situation in terms of competing with
[36:24] China, which is another reason why the
[36:25] pressure is just growing. uh at the end
[36:27] of the day and Jack Mers who's you know
[36:29] a a famous uh person on the Bitcoin side
[36:33] at the end of the day no matter what
[36:34] anyone tells you their only solution is
[36:36] to print money I could not agree more uh
[36:38] they have to do that and that's already
[36:41] happening so here is the global
[36:43] liquidity uh people are not focused on
[36:45] it it's ripping higher not just because
[36:48] the dollar is weakening since this is a
[36:50] dollar chart but it's also going up
[36:52] because China's adding liquidity
[36:54] Europe's adding liquidity they're going
[36:55] to build out defense the US is now going
[36:57] to have to add liquidity to the system.
[36:59] And Bitcoin has held up extremely well
[37:00] during this period. Uh I've talked about
[37:02] my favorite trade for the year, but I
[37:04] want to just highlight I tweeted this
[37:05] this week. This is critical for people
[37:07] looking to what they have to invest in
[37:09] next. Uh this is Bitcoin relative to the
[37:12] Mag 7. I've said repeatedly that once
[37:14] Bitcoin starts to become the only
[37:16] innovation that has a moat and the Mag 7
[37:20] now realize they no longer have a moat
[37:22] in terms of AI which I thought would
[37:23] disrupt this business but the trade
[37:25] situation where 50% of their revenues
[37:27] come from overseas where people are
[37:29] reducing their ownership in US assets.
[37:32] The Mag 7 are at the they're they're no
[37:34] longer going to have a multiple that is
[37:37] high and I thought their multiple was
[37:38] too high relative to the reality of
[37:41] their their growth. We knew they were
[37:42] spending lots of money, but this chart
[37:44] just shows that over the last three
[37:46] times that the S&P had a correction of
[37:48] at least 20%. So in 2018, S&P goes down,
[37:52] which is the yellow line, uh, MA Bitcoin
[37:54] versus the MAG 7 underperforms by 46%.
[37:58] Back here, down by 30%. Down here, 2022,
[38:02] again, 40 uh 40 plus% decline in Bitcoin
[38:07] relative to the MAG 7. Here we get a 20%
[38:09] decline in the S&P and Bitcoin versus
[38:12] the MAG7 since that day is up 13%. So if
[38:15] you're a long Bitcoin, short the Mag 7.
[38:18] All of those themes about what does
[38:19] Bitcoin do? What do they do? They are
[38:22] not exposed to the global situation. I
[38:24] will keep saying it. Go spend the week
[38:26] necessary to learn more about history on
[38:30] monetary debasement and what actually
[38:32] happens. And don't believe it has to end
[38:34] with the depression. We have a printing
[38:35] press, but more importantly, we're
[38:37] entering a world of artificial
[38:38] intelligence. We have never seen this
[38:40] before where the machines where people
[38:43] don't need to work. This is a completely
[38:45] different situation than the history
[38:47] book. So, all the history people, all
[38:49] the people I've been at dinners with
[38:50] that have regurgitated that this happens
[38:52] and always happens and this is what has
[38:53] to happen. This is not the same time.
[38:56] This is when the digital economy takes
[38:57] over for the physical economy and they
[39:00] merge together. Volatility on the two of
[39:02] the assets. So people were worried about
[39:04] Bitcoin volatility. So far this year uh
[39:07] last 60 days 47 V for the mag 7 53 V for
[39:13] Bitcoin used to be different in the past
[39:15] but this is not an asset like it was in
[39:17] the past. Stable coins uh the network
[39:20] effects for Bitcoin. I've talked about
[39:22] this uh much bigger picture. I don't
[39:24] feel most people understand
[39:26] this. Fed pal reassert support for
[39:29] stable coin legislation. I just want to
[39:31] repeat that. So, Donald Trump and and
[39:33] Jerome Pal agree on stable coin
[39:35] legislation. Everyone needs to go read
[39:37] about what stable coins are and make
[39:38] sure they understand it. Italy's finance
[39:41] minister warns US stable coins pose
[39:43] bigger threat than
[39:45] tariffs. These are massive statements.
[39:48] People need to go spend the time on it.
[39:49] Stable coin growth could drive 400
[39:51] billion a year into T bills. They are
[39:54] already one of the large top 20 largest
[39:56] owners of treasuries and it will
[39:58] continue to grow. And as I've said
[39:59] repeatedly, we will end this podcast,
[40:01] this uh this report
[40:04] here. Governments, central banks, and
[40:06] the wealthy people of the world are
[40:08] talking about how the world should end
[40:11] without any regard to what the 7 billion
[40:14] people on the planet who are going to
[40:17] benefit from the democratization of AI,
[40:19] which lets the entrepreneurs go up, but
[40:21] also gives the ability with stable coins
[40:24] to transact at lower costs. It opens up
[40:27] the banking system to those seven
[40:28] billion who can't get into a bank. They
[40:31] get to participate in the global capital
[40:33] system and they only want to make
[40:34] thousands of dollars, not millions of
[40:36] dollars. And when they make that money,
[40:38] those 7 billion people are in countries
[40:41] where they trust the US dollar more than
[40:44] the rest of the world in terms of the
[40:46] currencies. So the stable coin, that's
[40:48] why dollar stable coins, it's 99% US
[40:51] dollars and that's why Italy said stable
[40:53] coins posed a bigger risk. people around
[40:56] the globe, not the governments, not the
[40:58] the the 1%, they might sit there and be
[41:01] scared of moving their money to gold,
[41:03] but around the world where people are
[41:04] going to participate. Stable coin leads
[41:06] to more people participating. It leads
[41:08] to more democratization of
[41:10] entrepreneurship and it will lead to
[41:12] more money going into the digital
[41:13] economy which benefits both the US
[41:15] dollar and it benefits Bitcoin. So for
[41:18] the death of US exceptionalism, stable
[41:21] coins are going through the US
[41:22] administration at the same time that
[41:24] tariffs are going. This is a big switch
[41:25] towards a digital economy. It's time for
[41:27] everyone to do their homework on
[41:28] Bitcoin. That's it for this week.
