--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] quiet week for the markets as we come to
[00:03] the end of the first half of the year
[00:04] got through expiration on Friday. Uh
[00:07] this week uh I'm going to go through and
[00:09] kind of build around a report that was
[00:12] released by CO2.
[00:14] uh it's their east meets west 2025
[00:16] report and it's the first uh let's say
[00:20] technology focused or AI focused report
[00:24] that in my opinion really does a good
[00:28] job of connecting it all to macro what
[00:30] this AI move means so especially for
[00:32] people who still have not embraced what
[00:34] I've been going through in terms of the
[00:36] fact that everything in the economy
[00:38] right now is being driven by artificial
[00:40] intelligence and is the reason why the
[00:42] markets will continue to move higher.
[00:44] This report, I think, does a really good
[00:45] job of of uh breaking it out. So, I'm
[00:49] going to go through it. There's some
[00:50] things that I differ with. I think the
[00:51] report is way too optimistic on a couple
[00:53] things. Uh but, uh it's 102 pages. I
[00:57] highly recommend everyone go through and
[00:59] flip through it. Uh so, that's it. You
[01:01] can get it off their website.
[01:03] Uh if you want to do the quickie
[01:05] version, uh BG2, Brad Gersonner, and
[01:08] Bill Gurley uh had uh the uh Lefant
[01:12] brothers on and they went through it. It
[01:14] was a great episode. Again, my favorite
[01:16] uh technology uh podcast at this point.
[01:19] So, just to go through it, I mean,
[01:21] basically, they're comparing this to
[01:22] each of the different components uh and
[01:25] where we are. So starting here and then
[01:28] getting up, we're kind of in this point
[01:29] and this is going to accelerate and this
[01:31] will be again another massive wave of
[01:34] innovation. Uh they're talking about the
[01:37] fact that uh why couldn't this get up to
[01:40] 75% of US market cap. This is one of the
[01:42] places where I don't agree. I do not
[01:44] think technology is the winner in this.
[01:47] Uh I believe AI will be used by other
[01:49] parts and you'll start to see other
[01:52] parts of the economy be fine uh or
[01:55] broaden out. I think you're already
[01:56] seeing that Amazon is not really a tech
[01:58] company, but it is a tech company. Uh,
[02:00] in terms of today's top 50 companies,
[02:03] they're just showing where it is. I just
[02:04] want to highlight. They have Bitcoin on
[02:06] here as a top 50 company. One of the
[02:08] things that surprised me on here is they
[02:10] did finally embrace uh Bitcoin. Uh
[02:15] Philippe mentioned it. Uh I still he
[02:17] talked about the fact really know how to
[02:19] value it except for the fact that as a
[02:21] percentage of the fiat assets, it's only
[02:23] two trillion and 500 trillion. Uh he did
[02:26] mention uh that the incumbents are
[02:28] starting to see headwinds which I
[02:29] completely agree with. This is my
[02:31] Bitcoin over the Mag 7. I think the Mag
[02:34] 7 will have insane competition coming at
[02:37] their businesses. So they created this
[02:40] thing for 2030. Um and basically think
[02:43] of these as the companies that are going
[02:45] to benefit from AI. Uh there's a few
[02:47] things to notice here. Number one, you
[02:48] still see Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon.
[02:50] What you do not and Meta. What you do
[02:52] not see on here are Google and Apple uh
[02:54] implying that they are two of the
[02:56] incumbents that are going to be
[02:57] disrupted. Uh we've already seen that uh
[03:00] as I showed on the last page with Google
[03:02] and search. Uh but I think it's
[03:04] interesting and up here they have
[03:05] Bitcoin finishing 2030 as the uh third
[03:08] largest. I have said repeatedly I
[03:11] believe Bitcoin will finish this year as
[03:12] the biggest on this particular list uh
[03:15] not in 2030 but at the end of 2025. So
[03:18] we'll see uh where that is. Uh these are
[03:21] the takeaways from the presentation.
[03:23] AIdriven productivity boom reshaping the
[03:25] corporate model. Uh explosion in
[03:27] reasoning is the real growth engine.
[03:29] I've talked about this. We're going to
[03:30] go through it. I've written a lot of
[03:31] papers on this. Uh it's big for for
[03:34] energy. It's big for spreading out
[03:36] across the AI agents. Uh Bitcoin and
[03:38] stable coins are becoming s uh systemic
[03:41] systemic
[03:43] assets. Hypers scale GPO arms race is
[03:46] redefining cloud power. Productivity
[03:48] growth may solve the US debt problem.
[03:49] I'll go through that. Uh AI cycle is
[03:52] reviving IPOs and M&A activity. Not
[03:56] really seeing that that much at this
[03:58] point. Um one of the things Gersonner
[04:00] they talked about on there and this I'll
[04:01] get into again and again and again uh is
[04:04] the golden age of margin expansion. Uh
[04:06] which basically means the ability of AI
[04:09] to grow top lines while holding the line
[04:11] on headcount. Uh so this again is going
[04:14] to get into the dynamic that I think
[04:16] people are minimizing in terms of the
[04:18] backlash that's going to come from
[04:20] people losing jobs which I think has
[04:22] already started uh and will continue to
[04:24] be an issue. Um OpenAI's got 2700
[04:28] employees versus Google's 187,000. And
[04:31] this is what makes this a problem. Um if
[04:33] you view them as a startup, you view
[04:35] this, the more people you have, the more
[04:37] challenging it's going to be. It's just
[04:39] the way it is. the bureaucracy,
[04:41] everything that happens at a time when
[04:42] AI is allowing you to replace things
[04:44] without it. So, uh, for every 2700
[04:47] employees, the question is, will there
[04:50] be a bunch of small places that'll
[04:52] continue to eat at some of the places
[04:53] that Google is in? I believe so. A
[04:56] replacing not physical labor, but
[04:58] cognitive middle management work, a
[05:00] direct byproduct of AI's reasoning
[05:02] explosion. The reasoning capabilities of
[05:04] AI not just automation or code
[05:05] generation are central to the Lefance
[05:07] thesis on why AI will drive explosive
[05:09] growth efficiency in business. I
[05:10] completely agree reasoning reasoning
[05:13] reasoning has been the big thing. They
[05:14] highlight some of the things I brought
[05:16] up. Sacha Nadella we process over 100
[05:18] trillion tokens this quarter up five
[05:20] times year-over-year
[05:22] uh including 50 trillion
[05:25] last month alone. I showed Google last
[05:27] week at 50x in terms of tokens on their
[05:30] most recent thing over a year. Uh
[05:32] remember what uh Satcha Nadella said,
[05:36] Jeban's paradox strikes again. As AI
[05:38] gets more efficient and accessible, we
[05:40] will see its use skyrocket, turning it
[05:41] into a commodity we just can't get
[05:43] enough of. This was after deepseek when
[05:46] everyone panicked about DeepSeek and
[05:49] launch of deep research and reasoning
[05:51] model which also coincides with deepseek
[05:53] which forced them to continue to move
[05:55] things faster and get it out. Uh this is
[05:58] the growth we saw. So chat GPT is
[06:00] growing faster than anything we've ever
[06:02] seen before. AI is running through the
[06:05] economy. Um the afflection is beyond
[06:08] just consumer use. Share of businesses
[06:10] with paid subscriptions to AI is now
[06:13] going up as well. And again the
[06:14] inflection point right when reasoning
[06:17] model started to come in agents
[06:19] everything along those lines. This is
[06:20] why I wrote the inference inflection
[06:22] where real-time AI meets real world
[06:24] opportunity. I went through all of the
[06:26] companies. I'm not going to read this
[06:28] stuff. all of the companies. We're just
[06:30] getting started with the upcoming rise
[06:31] of AI agents, AI native phones and PCs,
[06:33] embodied AI like self-driving platforms
[06:36] and humanoid robots, inference manus go
[06:38] parabolic. Um the in the implications
[06:41] for semiconductors, memory, networking,
[06:43] power and edge computer are massive.
[06:46] Basically, that's where we are right
[06:47] now. That's what the Lefant uh brothers
[06:50] went through on the podcast and that's
[06:53] what you can see in the report. Now this
[06:55] week uh we did get a message from Andy
[06:57] Jasse at at Amazon. Technologies like
[07:00] Gen AI are rare. They come about once in
[07:02] a lifetime and completely change what's
[07:03] possible for customers. So we are
[07:05] investing quite expansively and the
[07:07] progress we are making is evident. Um
[07:10] what has happened to AI stocks. This is
[07:12] the Goldman Sachs long short AI pair. So
[07:15] this is long companies benefiting from
[07:17] AI short companies that are going to be
[07:19] hurt by AI. You can see it's driving the
[07:22] market. Um and again it started from the
[07:24] bottom there but it had consolidated
[07:26] before Masa Sun pitches$1 trillion
[07:27] dollar US AI hub. I'm just going to go
[07:30] through the again continuation of just
[07:32] the massive numbers we're seeing
[07:33] associated with this which again is
[07:35] confirmation that this is happening and
[07:37] if you think it's a bubble again you're
[07:38] going to continue to make a mistake. You
[07:40] have to spend the time learning about AI
[07:42] and understanding the difference between
[07:44] a training model and a chatbot and
[07:46] reasoning completely different things.
[07:48] The ability to use it you get smarter.
[07:50] you go through this if you haven't done
[07:51] it yet and you're still bearish on the
[07:53] economy and bearish on the stock market.
[07:55] Good luck with surviving. You're going
[07:56] to be one of the people that suffers. Uh
[07:58] Zuckerberg apparently uh offering a
[08:01] hundred million bonuses to come there
[08:04] again his failing AI efforts. So there's
[08:07] pressure on Meta that show up on how are
[08:09] they going to catch up discuss buying
[08:11] perplexity. What's the other company
[08:13] that's having trouble? Apple executives
[08:14] have internal talks about buying AI
[08:16] startup perplexity. This was on Friday
[08:18] after the market closed. So for the week
[08:21] um with Iran, Israel again, two weeks in
[08:24] a row now, we're just consolidating here
[08:25] after these big rallies we saw. So not
[08:28] no real move. Um consolidation up near
[08:30] the all-time highs. And as I said
[08:32] before, would not be surprised to see us
[08:34] come back to the 200 day moving average
[08:36] at a minimum. We went back and went to
[08:38] the 20. We're kind of recycling. It's
[08:40] about a month now. We haven't done
[08:41] anything. So there hasn't been much
[08:44] that's gone on. uh we're entering uh the
[08:46] blackout periods in we've hit there.
[08:49] They will slow reducing a major part of
[08:52] demand as I've shown this is over a
[08:54] trillion dollars annually. So with 252
[08:57] trading days you can go through this
[08:59] when the window is open you're talking5
[09:01] to7 billion of demand. When it closes it
[09:05] gradually runs off. So just keep in mind
[09:08] that these periods are kind of where
[09:10] consolidations or corrections would
[09:11] start. uh in terms of what for the month
[09:14] to date uh energy has been the best
[09:15] performing sector obviously Iran Israel
[09:18] has had an impact but I think uh as I've
[09:20] said before tech has held has done very
[09:22] well uh as well I think there's more to
[09:24] the story now one of the reasons tech
[09:26] has done well and you can see the best
[09:29] uh level three gick industry groups
[09:33] you've got a lot of topheavy things here
[09:36] related to AI or at least related to the
[09:38] war to geopolitics
[09:41] um But semi and equipment are in there
[09:43] as well. You've got some of the REITs uh
[09:46] in there which again are being driven by
[09:47] the AI stuff, construction engineering.
[09:50] Basically, you got a lot of growth stuff
[09:51] in there or a lot of commodity related
[09:53] things. Uh and that brings us to one of
[09:55] the reasons. So, WTI the second month
[09:58] contract is up 24% uh monthto date. So,
[10:01] over the last decade, you can kind of
[10:03] isolate this. You're dealing with the
[10:05] COVID period. If it wasn't for the COVID
[10:06] period, this is the biggest move.
[10:09] There's plenty of Middle East actions
[10:10] that have gone on here, but as of right
[10:12] now, crude is up 24%. And I think that's
[10:14] important. Again, I've been talking
[10:16] about the second half of the year being
[10:17] a a a realization that the reasoning
[10:19] demands that are showing up in the token
[10:21] usage will put pressure on energy. And
[10:24] once we get into the summertime where we
[10:26] have more likelihood of hurricanes,
[10:27] where there's blackout um possibilities,
[10:29] I think energy is going to start to take
[10:31] a focus. This is the um energy uh the
[10:34] commodity energy sector. So this is the
[10:36] GSCI index and for the month it's up
[10:39] 21%. So again you go back this is almost
[10:43] this is over 20 years. This is a big
[10:45] move. Um and even though this is Iran
[10:47] Israel um I I wanted to just highlight
[10:51] three podcasts that for those of you who
[10:53] want to not read Iran Israel all the
[10:55] time and read and listen to three
[10:57] podcasts where I think they do a good
[10:58] job of explaining what you should
[11:00] expect. Uh Marco Papich I've I've you
[11:02] I've referenced him a lot on here. He
[11:04] does a podcast with Jacob Shapiro. They
[11:06] went through this. Uh so did uh this
[11:08] podcast in terms of honesty with Barry
[11:11] Weiss had Neil Ferguson and Dexter
[11:12] Filkins, another good one. And then
[11:14] finally, Good Fellows I thought was very
[11:16] good. This also includes Neil Ferguson,
[11:19] but it has HR McMaster as well. And they
[11:21] go through it and they talk about uh one
[11:23] common thread they believe is that this
[11:25] will last uh a long time. Uh they don't
[11:28] think this is just going to end. So with
[11:30] all the speculation that Trump is going
[11:31] to come up with something whether the US
[11:33] involves itself or not they don't think
[11:35] it's going to be a very very short
[11:37] situation uh and so if this lasts for
[11:40] more than say a few weeks uh or a few
[11:43] months uh I think there's a floor in
[11:46] energy and it comes at a time where
[11:47] again I like to focus on ven diagrams
[11:49] that are connecting the geopolitical
[11:52] side whether it's tariffs whether it's
[11:53] whatever with AI and in this case as Sam
[11:56] Alman said when he took the stand in
[11:58] front of Congress
[12:00] uh the cost of AI will converge to the
[12:03] cost of energy. Uh the AI revolution
[12:05] isn't possible with an energy
[12:06] revolution. We're going to have problems
[12:08] with the power because of the
[12:09] exponential move. I wrote a piece for
[12:11] 22V this week on Chevron and Exxon. It's
[12:14] so funny to hear people that are energy
[12:15] people immediately talk about uh this is
[12:19] not an idea blah blah blah. I I I really
[12:21] think people are missing the fact that
[12:24] unless they focus on the AI side of the
[12:27] equation and the demand stuff being
[12:29] insatiable companies like Chevron and
[12:32] Exxon that historically were not thought
[12:34] of as AI companies, I believe they will
[12:36] be thought of as AI because they are the
[12:38] electron giants for the AI age. So their
[12:40] business which I already highlighted in
[12:42] here the ways they've they've they've
[12:44] been adopting but the world is adopting
[12:47] AI faster than ever before. This is from
[12:49] Google. 9 trillion tokens to 480. This
[12:52] is a direct number of electricity. So
[12:55] the electrons used for this growth is
[12:58] insanity. Um Larry Ellison, we'll take
[13:01] all the capacity you have. Wherever
[13:02] we'll buy every megawatt you can deliver
[13:04] anywhere in the world. I highlighted
[13:05] that last week. The energy demand is
[13:07] real. So when you connect the AI energy
[13:09] demand and you realize that here are the
[13:12] Chevron earnings forecast. So they've
[13:16] basically followed crude. This is the
[13:18] 12th contract of crude. So looking out
[13:20] to next year. Um this fell on liberation
[13:23] day. So you had all the analysts move
[13:25] their earnings revisions down. Now
[13:27] you've got crude back up here. And again
[13:29] this is before anything from the AI
[13:31] demand side. It's not that oil is in
[13:34] there. But obviously if gas goes up, if
[13:36] other energies are going up, if there's
[13:38] demand, there will be switching. There
[13:40] will be massive switching that has to go
[13:42] because we are going to be short
[13:43] electrons. So rather than think of these
[13:45] things as oil or whatever, you have to
[13:48] go through that's why I did the report
[13:49] on it. This is again from the east meets
[13:52] west report from codeu and they're
[13:53] basically again so if you look at this
[13:55] autos oil manufacturing factories global
[13:58] leader of industrial revolution I just
[13:59] want you to think when you're following
[14:01] things like the PMI data you're
[14:04] following this at this point
[14:06] semiconductors electricity AI factories
[14:08] global leader of AI revolution this is a
[14:10] different world completely different AI
[14:12] has changed the entire concept um one
[14:16] thing that has not changed is the supply
[14:18] chain So this pink line here is the
[14:22] Cosby which has continued to go higher
[14:24] and this is the equal weight semis. I
[14:26] still believe semis as cotu wrote and as
[14:29] I say all semis analog anything that's
[14:31] dead uh shortages just buy as much as
[14:34] you can. It's going to take a while
[14:36] because AI is not only growing fast but
[14:38] the data center growth is going to
[14:39] explode. Uh Caterpillar again finally
[14:43] getting called as uh benefiting from AI.
[14:46] This is to kind of emphasize the Chevron
[14:48] Exxon point. Uh Caterpillar is a heavy
[14:51] part of this including generators. So
[14:54] again, they're involved. So is
[14:57] Generrack. All of these places that are
[14:59] involved with the electricity side will
[15:00] be in there. Um
[15:03] economic data, city surprise index has
[15:05] gone back to the lows of the year. It
[15:07] actually went down to lower than it was
[15:09] here. Now again, the city surprise index
[15:11] means how the data is coming in relative
[15:13] to expectations. This is overlaid with
[15:15] 10ear rates. Um, so this is getting
[15:18] interesting in the fact that uh the
[15:20] economy is not bouncing at all, meaning
[15:23] it's fine. We're going to have 3 and GDP
[15:26] in uh in Q2, but we didn't get any kind
[15:29] of a big bounce in the data. So things
[15:31] are just kind of mulling along. And I
[15:34] think the main reason that things are
[15:36] just mulling along here is the fact that
[15:38] consumers are concerned with the AI
[15:41] situation. So I'm going to just bring up
[15:44] some points here and again this is from
[15:47] the report. So this is actually uh from
[15:50] the report in terms of uh this is
[15:52] actually from the podcast but it's
[15:54] related to the report. AI is enabling
[15:56] top lane growth without headcount.
[15:57] Executives are planning for fewer
[15:59] employees. What if our headcount was
[16:01] down 50% in three years? Massive
[16:04] productivity gains not just cost
[16:05] cutting. Will AI cause mass
[16:07] unemployment? They ask directly and this
[16:10] is what the answer is. Is a AI going to
[16:12] increase or reduce unemployment? I'm not
[16:14] 100% sure. But if forced to answer, I
[16:17] have faith faith it might actually
[16:19] create more jobs. This is the problem.
[16:21] This is where we are in the economy
[16:23] right now is nobody seems to know the
[16:27] situation on AI. I've given my opinions.
[16:30] I'm going to keep to go through it. Use
[16:31] the data as facts. Use consumer
[16:34] confidence as facts. But also the
[16:36] questions I'm getting, the only way
[16:37] people can ensure that they're going to
[16:39] have a job in my opinion is to use
[16:41] artificial intelligence every single
[16:43] day. That's the only way you can ensure
[16:45] it because you will be displaced. You
[16:47] can go get a job in another industry. Uh
[16:50] but if you want to stay in the same
[16:51] industry, you have to be able to use AI
[16:53] to justify it because it will increase
[16:54] your productivity. U there will be new
[16:57] companies. I feel good about that too.
[16:59] But that takes a lot longer time,
[17:01] especially from people who aren't using
[17:02] AI now, which is probably the reason why
[17:04] they're not going to have a job. AI
[17:06] could lead to net positive employment in
[17:08] the long run. That's my main issue is I
[17:11] think in the short run, people are
[17:12] underestimating how difficult it is
[17:14] because of the demand speed and the
[17:17] insane usage that are happening and the
[17:19] adoption. I just think this is going way
[17:21] too fast because it will benefit
[17:24] companies that are able to do this. So
[17:25] warn notices started to pick up in a I
[17:29] want to say a more meaningful way. So we
[17:31] went up to the highs since 2023. Warn
[17:34] notices are basically uh and this is
[17:38] from the Cleveland Fed. Uh it is a
[17:41] leading indicator of what claims. So it
[17:44] that's why it says warn. So we've seen
[17:46] the numbers go higher. Uh in June 2025,
[17:50] more than 170 companies are expected to
[17:52] announce layoffs based on warrant
[17:54] filings.
[17:55] This s uh passes the roughly 130
[17:57] companies in May. So we're seeing more,
[18:01] but they're spanning a broad range of
[18:03] industries. Finance, retail, food and
[18:06] beverage. You notice how big these
[18:07] companies are. Individual state reports
[18:10] see significant layoff activity.
[18:12] Pennsylvania, New Jersey, broad. So
[18:15] we're seeing it on a on a much broader
[18:18] level than we have in the past. The
[18:20] thing that bothers me is I look for
[18:22] scenarios where there's correlation
[18:24] between uh the claims and the warn
[18:27] notices and that's what we have right
[18:29] now. So last year when we saw uh claims
[18:32] kind of jump in May and there was a
[18:34] question if they were seasonality the
[18:36] warn notices actually collapsed. What
[18:38] you have right now is the warn notices
[18:40] and the claims number claims uh have
[18:43] been tracking higher. Uh at the same
[18:45] time
[18:48] I mentioned the Andy Jasse thing. Um I
[18:50] see smaller Amazon workforce due to
[18:52] generative AI should change the way our
[18:54] work is done. Um technologies like Genai
[18:58] are rare. Oh, I highlighted this. Um the
[19:00] progress we're making is evident,
[19:03] but this is the main thing. Many of
[19:05] these agents have yet to be built, but
[19:06] make no mistake, they're coming and
[19:08] they're coming fast. There will be
[19:09] billions of these agents across every
[19:11] company in every imaginable field.
[19:14] Basically, no matter how do you go
[19:15] through this, they're openly talking
[19:17] about it. So, Axios put an article out
[19:19] this week, why CEOs are using AI to
[19:22] scare workers
[19:24] and with inside the article, the
[19:25] transformation will likely reduce our
[19:27] total uh corporate workforce. This is
[19:29] again the Andy Jasse side. Uh JP Morgan
[19:33] told AI investors would allow for 10%
[19:35] headcount reduction. Executives are
[19:38] concerned about AI impact. They believe
[19:39] employees aren't taking it seriously
[19:41] enough. Shopify sent out to employees. I
[19:45] highlighted that last week. Uh a warning
[19:47] with anticipated alert that preempts
[19:49] later drama going viral. These are all
[19:52] the reasons why the CEOs are being more
[19:55] aggressive. And this is part of the
[19:58] issue. The tough talk is for Wall Street
[20:00] to signal that company is on trend.
[20:02] Basically saying that you're going to
[20:03] reduce headcount is a positive for
[20:05] stocks. That's where the issue comes.
[20:07] This is where the inequality argument
[20:09] continues to go through which again is
[20:11] what they didn't talk about in this
[20:13] report. What they did talk about is
[20:15] again highlighting has Microsoft reached
[20:18] peak employment and I've talked about
[20:21] this and shown this on many many of the
[20:23] the the uh YouTubes lately. Here's what
[20:27] Gersonner's quote was on jobs and
[20:29] growth. We've never seen this in the
[20:30] history of technology. companies growing
[20:32] topline revenue over 20% annually while
[20:35] operating expenses and head count grow
[20:37] at just 2%. It's never happened before.
[20:39] I've talked about that. This is not like
[20:41] other innovations and other
[20:42] displacement. I'll go through part of
[20:44] the reasons why, but every time I hear
[20:45] the technology people try to tell people
[20:48] this will not reduce jobs. We are not
[20:51] just reducing uh through innovation and
[20:53] machinery like the industrial
[20:55] revolution. We have humanoids coming up
[20:57] in the next 5 years to replace physical
[20:59] labor. mass amounts of physical labor.
[21:01] We have transportation jobs being
[21:03] replaced. Those were these are
[21:05] decisionmaking jobs. So full
[21:07] self-driving, the amount of transport
[21:09] drivers in the country is huge. We have
[21:11] a shortage, but we will replace people
[21:13] as as time goes on. White collar jobs
[21:15] are being replaced. So what are we
[21:16] seeing? And these are the facts. Temp
[21:19] peaked in 22. This started on the rate
[21:21] hike side, but then Chad GPT came out
[21:23] here. You're seeing temporary hires go
[21:26] down. This is the unemployment uh this
[21:28] is the job situation in the US in terms
[21:30] of the number of people employed. Uh the
[21:34] pressure of just seeing that they're not
[21:36] even hiring temps and for the first time
[21:38] not seeing the overall jobs go down. But
[21:40] it's not just there. This is the part
[21:42] that I think hurts the confidence the
[21:43] most. Uh and this is the temp again in
[21:47] terms of the orange line. So this is
[21:48] that temp. But the white line here is
[21:51] the quits rate. So again, when you start
[21:54] getting into the quits rate or the New
[21:55] York Fed, the ability to get a job after
[21:57] you've quit, these things are rolling
[22:00] over. It's taking longer and longer for
[22:02] people to find jobs and the fear factor
[22:04] is growing that they won't be able to
[22:06] do. So this is where you see it in
[22:07] consumer confidence in terms of jobs,
[22:09] plentiful
[22:11] uh the so this is the labor one in terms
[22:14] of the differential, the labor
[22:15] differential inverted. So you're seeing
[22:18] this worsen meaning people are not
[22:21] confident about jobs it's been a trend
[22:23] that's gone on again since the rate
[22:25] situation went higher but then also as
[22:28] chat GPT came in and those are the two
[22:30] forces
[22:32] your rates are staying at higher levels
[22:33] the Fed are not cutting and that's
[22:35] because of AI no one talks about it the
[22:38] reason that they are not cutting rates
[22:39] right now is solely because of
[22:41] artificial intelligence because we
[22:42] wouldn't be growing this way we wouldn't
[22:44] be able to sustain the higher rates if
[22:46] it wasn't for the the mag the mag 7 and
[22:49] the tech companies to be able to grow
[22:51] without people. Uh they've been able to
[22:53] offset some of the other expenses. So
[22:55] the corporate expense thing is real. The
[22:58] pressure is growing because people are
[22:59] not confident about the jobs that they
[23:01] have. The unemployment rate is still
[23:03] down here. That's what makes this
[23:04] situation so uh strange. And I don't
[23:07] think we're going to have a recession. I
[23:08] think we're having a psychological
[23:10] recession for the bottom 50% in the in
[23:13] the country. they can go get a job, but
[23:15] it's having an impact. Here are the um
[23:17] recent college graduates versus other
[23:20] groups. So, this blue line here is
[23:22] recent college graduates aged 22 to 27.
[23:24] Look at the unemployment rate. It's
[23:26] higher than any time from 2015 to 2020,
[23:29] and it's trending higher. This is a very
[23:31] dangerous thing when college graduates
[23:33] can't get jobs. So, what you have here
[23:35] is the total employment minus the recent
[23:38] grad unemployment. So, now you're taking
[23:39] differential between the numbers in
[23:41] terms of the rate. We've never been here
[23:43] before. So this is from 1990. So when
[23:46] CO2 talks about the productivity gains
[23:47] that we saw in the '9s from technology
[23:49] and the fact that it was good for
[23:51] workers, this is not the same thing
[23:53] right now. This is a very dangerous
[23:54] situation because of the nature of AI in
[23:57] my opinion. And I think minimizing is a
[23:59] problem. Um labor share is going to
[24:01] become the thing. This in in my opinion
[24:03] is the reason why Donald Trump won the
[24:05] election is because people are feeling
[24:07] this. They don't know what's happening.
[24:08] When we talk about trying to do tariffs
[24:10] to help uh the workers inside the
[24:12] country and we say well these jobs are
[24:13] not going to actually come back it's a
[24:15] very very challenging thing. Labor
[24:17] shares of national income this is from
[24:18] May of 2019 this is a McKenzie report uh
[24:22] paid out in wages and benefits has been
[24:24] declining in the developed world since
[24:27] the 1980s.
[24:28] Inequality and loss of the consumer
[24:31] purchasing power. The rising power of
[24:33] companies versus the workers whether
[24:35] from new technology, globalization, the
[24:37] hollowing out of labor unions or market
[24:39] consolidation has shaped that. So that
[24:41] was 5 years before the election. This
[24:43] trend has been in place and that is the
[24:45] reason why workers are feeling it. But
[24:47] we're also seeing it for companies.
[24:49] Right now companies are going bankrupt
[24:50] at the fastest rate since 2010. I fully
[24:53] expect this number to be going up up
[24:56] partly because of AI disruption, partly
[24:58] because of rate disruption. When you
[24:59] link the two together, if you can't
[25:01] adopt and benefit from AI, I don't see
[25:04] how you can possibly make it. And what's
[25:06] coming down the line with humanoids and
[25:08] everything else, if you don't have the
[25:09] capital, if you borrow money, if you're
[25:11] gone through private uh debt, I don't
[25:14] see how you're going to survive. So,
[25:16] they want to create positive spin. Um,
[25:19] and this is where I've talked about this
[25:21] also. I just think it's way down the
[25:23] line. And my fear is that over the next
[25:25] four years, the demand side of AI uh and
[25:27] the adoption side is going much faster
[25:29] than history, which means it's going to
[25:30] have a bigger impact on the employees.
[25:33] And I think this again is more of a if
[25:35] you can't move up the corporate ladder,
[25:37] if you've taken out debt and you have
[25:38] debt and now you don't have a job, it's
[25:40] just not going to be as easy as it was
[25:42] to go out and get a job because most
[25:44] companies are having trouble kind of
[25:45] making it through this. So they're
[25:47] talking about how AI productivity can
[25:49] help the debt and deficit. That all
[25:50] sounds really good. It goes through
[25:53] And they use the historical preent
[25:55] 1990s. They go through all these nice
[25:57] little numbers. You lower the unit labor
[25:59] costs. You get lower inflation. You'll
[26:02] eventually get lower interest rates,
[26:03] higher GDP growth, higher tax receipts,
[26:05] lower debt to GDP. I agree with all of
[26:07] this stuff except for one problem. This
[26:10] is happening fast in terms of getting
[26:12] rid of people. The lower inflation is
[26:15] not happening as fast, but it is keeping
[26:17] on the lower end. the lower rates we're
[26:19] not getting at this point because growth
[26:21] is coming through and the Fed has not
[26:23] made the adjustment at this point to
[26:25] lower rates. Uh which I think they
[26:27] already should be doing, but that's a
[26:28] different story for a different day.
[26:30] Higher GDP growth. Um I'm not sure that
[26:33] the way we calculate GDP and AI can show
[26:35] up in higher GDP growth. So I think
[26:37] that's an issue because this is an
[26:39] efficiency gain rather than a higher GDP
[26:41] growth. Higher tax receipts I don't
[26:43] think are going to come through. So, I
[26:44] think the debt to GDP ratio, as much as
[26:46] they want to go through these
[26:47] calculations and these numbers, it's all
[26:49] well and good. They've got this now with
[26:51] an AGI case in terms of how strong it'll
[26:53] be ASI. Let's assume that these numbers
[26:55] are right. That's not happening until
[26:57] 2030. This isn't happening until maybe
[26:59] 2035. Whatever the case is, it's going
[27:02] to take a while to get there. If we get
[27:04] there, and in the interim, I think
[27:05] there's going to be a problem in terms
[27:07] of people out of work and how they're
[27:09] feeling and what the government's going
[27:10] to have to do. If AI is the productivity
[27:12] panacea, the market is already priced
[27:13] in, US GDP over the next day would
[27:15] dramatically higher. So there are people
[27:16] that are on this. I happen to agree. Um
[27:19] Alon Mus fixing the government's kind of
[27:20] like the beach is dirty and there's some
[27:22] needles and feces and trash. You want to
[27:23] clean up the beach. How much does
[27:25] cleaning the beach really matter if
[27:26] you've got a thousand foot AI tsunami
[27:28] about to hit? And his point I agree with
[27:30] the people just don't realize how much
[27:32] benefits are going to come from AI. But
[27:35] the navigation in the US and I'll go
[27:37] through why specifically the US I think
[27:39] is very challenging. Um they had this
[27:42] chart in inflation and again this is the
[27:44] positive surprise that I just don't
[27:45] think the market has embraced yet. I
[27:48] think this is a second half of the year
[27:49] story. Tariffs have not shown up yet and
[27:52] they are one time. Now this is
[27:54] year-over-year CPI with with live rent.
[27:57] So rent is a lagging the data is
[27:59] lagging. They're including the current
[28:01] one. We're, you can see we're below
[28:03] where we were before this. This is why,
[28:05] in my opinion, the Fed should be going.
[28:07] This is having an impact because of AI.
[28:09] AI is not driving the prices lower
[28:11] necessarily, but what it is doing is
[28:14] it's going to continue to soften the
[28:16] bottom 50%. And this is also going to
[28:19] have an impact. So, when they say with
[28:21] live rents, remember this is not getting
[28:24] a big story yet. We'll see if we get
[28:25] another month of this. uh but house
[28:28] prices are coming down across the
[28:30] country in many many locations. This is
[28:33] a very unique situation. So yes, it
[28:35] happened in when rates went through the
[28:37] roof. We did see a few months of this. I
[28:39] only bring this up because it seems like
[28:41] with labor worsening terms of jobs or
[28:46] fear and house prices coming down, I
[28:48] think people have to start paying
[28:49] attention that inflation is probably
[28:51] going to surprise on the downside. So
[28:53] once we get through the tariff fears,
[28:54] which I think are overblown, as I've
[28:56] talked about, I think then we'll be back
[28:58] in a situation where maybe the Fed can
[29:00] lower rates. The question is, will
[29:01] Jerome Pow lower rates or will we have
[29:02] to wait until March of next year? Uh
[29:04] because I don't think you're going to be
[29:06] seeing massive job losses. I think the
[29:08] pressure on the jobs market is a
[29:09] psychological one where people feel in
[29:12] trouble at all times because they're
[29:14] hearing people now getting laid off that
[29:15] are good workers and it's hard to get a
[29:18] job. So I think this is starting to have
[29:19] a psychological impact uh at a very high
[29:22] level on the country. Um US debt holders
[29:24] should brace for impact. This was an
[29:27] interesting article. It's worth reading.
[29:29] Um William Beer uh wrote this for the
[29:33] project syndicate with an SER. Um it's
[29:36] just talking about how and again I bring
[29:38] this up because I think this is where
[29:40] we're eventually going to have to get
[29:41] to. If we don't grow and if the jobs
[29:44] market is weakening at the expense of
[29:46] profit margins, then at some point the
[29:49] Fed is going to have to do something to
[29:51] deal with the deficits. If we're not
[29:52] getting consumption and we're not
[29:54] getting spending, I don't know where
[29:55] this is going to go. So, he's basically
[29:57] writing in here that the message is
[29:59] clear. Without fiscal responsibility,
[30:00] the Fed may find itself effectively
[30:02] printing money to bail out the
[30:04] government. Um, this is the end result
[30:07] of what happens when you've got a
[30:09] creative destruction going on. PBOC
[30:13] gave a speech this week, new world
[30:14] currency order after the dollar era. I
[30:17] think everyone needs to take this
[30:18] seriously. Again, the dollar could have
[30:20] a bounce at any point for a little bit
[30:21] of time. But I think the there's a
[30:23] tsunami of selling in the dollar as
[30:25] well. Uh which is going to continue
[30:28] going forward. I don't think we're going
[30:29] to have a collapse in the dollar, but I
[30:31] do think there's going to be sell
[30:32] pressure on risk of dollar dominance.
[30:35] warned over reliance on a single
[30:36] currency creates systemic risk and can
[30:38] compromise the fiscal stability of the
[30:39] issuing country with spillover effects
[30:41] that could trigger a national financial
[30:43] crisis. So I think everyone's noticing
[30:45] the problem in the US the way the voters
[30:47] are voting it's created an issue. It's
[30:49] added to the issue and the US has made
[30:50] the decision they cannot have a stronger
[30:52] currency that a stronger currency helps
[30:53] the wealthy and we need to have a weaker
[30:55] currency to help make our trade more um
[31:00] get rid of our trade deficits which will
[31:01] help the bottom side. This is what we're
[31:03] going to go through. The only other
[31:05] thing they mention is modernizing
[31:07] payments, modernizing crossber payment
[31:09] systems using digital technologies. The
[31:11] new system is being admitted by the
[31:13] Chinese and the US. It will happen. What
[31:15] I did after all of this and kind of
[31:17] going through is I took a walk down Park
[31:19] Avenue before my discussion with Pomp
[31:22] yesterday and I just want to make sure
[31:24] that people see this is the way that I
[31:26] have a conversation with chat GPT. I go
[31:28] through it every single day. But in this
[31:30] case, what I wanted to do is I want to
[31:32] start a conversation how AI is going to
[31:33] disrupt workers and cause more anger in
[31:35] the US very much like the industrial
[31:38] revolution did to workers in the early
[31:39] 1900s. Can we talk about that? Um, what
[31:43] I want to get to is did workers start to
[31:45] unionize because of industrialization?
[31:48] It goes through this, but there's two
[31:50] parts of each AI which are different.
[31:52] Number one, on the intelligence side, AI
[31:54] is replacing white color jobs in terms
[31:56] of what's coming. humanoids will replace
[31:58] blue collar jobs. So, isn't this a
[32:00] unique technology and unionizing will
[32:02] not be a solution to this one? I'm
[32:05] bringing up the unions because the
[32:06] unions were one of the steps that Joseph
[32:09] Shumper had talked about. Um, I talk and
[32:12] I keep going on this to say, okay,
[32:14] doesn't this create an optimistic
[32:16] scenario for entrepreneurs, which it
[32:18] agreed it did because now AI is making
[32:20] capital cheap, everything is good. uh
[32:22] you have the ability of moving, you have
[32:24] the ability of competing, you have the
[32:26] ability of growing your business. I talk
[32:28] about all of that. Um I'm putting this
[32:30] in there so to emphasize what you need
[32:33] to be using with the chat side with GBT.
[32:36] This is just on my AirPods as I'm
[32:37] walking down the street having a
[32:39] conversation. Um let's get back to the
[32:41] concept of unionization. So I believe
[32:43] what is happening is through both stable
[32:45] coins and the attractiveness of Bitcoin
[32:46] tokenization to come that the ability to
[32:49] raise capital
[32:52] and stay private and disrupt established
[32:54] businesses that the crypto space will
[32:56] continue to be the leading edge and will
[32:58] take investment dollars from the fiat
[32:59] system. This is the revolution that I
[33:01] believe is happening. This is the form
[33:03] of unionization
[33:05] uh of unionizing of people being able to
[33:08] fight back. It's just going to take some
[33:10] time. Uh I wanted to just emphasize
[33:12] again Shumper argued that capitalism
[33:15] through creative destruction constantly
[33:16] revolutionizes production. It inherently
[33:18] displaces labor tied to outdated
[33:20] technologies or system. The result
[33:22] persistent disruption employment and
[33:23] income stability for workers. As
[33:26] innovation faves favors capital. So the
[33:28] companies labor's bargaining power
[33:30] diminishes would weaken organized labor.
[33:32] That's exactly what we've had.
[33:33] Entrepreneurs versus workers. Returns
[33:35] would increasingly flow to capital and
[33:36] innovation not traditional labor. The
[33:39] long-term downward pressure on labor's
[33:41] income
[33:42] is from technological progress.
[33:48] How shareholder value intensifies. So in
[33:50] this case, remember in the US we focus
[33:52] on shareholders. So these companies are
[33:57] getting rid of people to continue to go
[34:00] through their profit margins and focus
[34:02] on shareholders. The system is
[34:04] cannibalizing itself. If labor continues
[34:06] to lose share of income, aggregate
[34:08] demand weakens long-term growth.
[34:10] Shumpert Fost saw the risk that
[34:11] capitalism might collapse not from
[34:13] failure but from its very success in
[34:15] undermining the social class structure
[34:16] that supports it. That is what we are
[34:19] seeing. The bottom 50% are getting
[34:21] displaced and I view this situation as
[34:24] worsening at the same time that the S&P
[34:26] profit margins are growing. Uh you're
[34:29] now entering a new world. I think every
[34:31] my my industry the asset management
[34:33] industry is going to go through it. I
[34:35] have people reaching out to me
[34:36] constantly, particularly after last
[34:38] week, after doing talking about how I'm
[34:40] using Perplexity for 60% of my time
[34:42] instead of Bloomberg. People want to
[34:44] learn how to do it. I'm just going to
[34:45] re-emphasize this there. This is not
[34:47] software. You have to use it every
[34:50] single day. You have to build a
[34:51] relationship with it. You have to talk
[34:53] to it. You have to think with it. You
[34:54] have to use it for everything that you
[34:56] do. And if you do not, there's no jobs
[35:00] coming in the future that are going to
[35:02] be created by it where you just press a
[35:03] button. You're gonna have to be creative
[35:05] and you're gonna have to have an
[35:06] entrepreneurial mindset. This is why I
[35:08] wrote this this week for Substack. I'm
[35:10] sick of getting asked by people why
[35:12] Bitcoin is the purest AI trade. Joseph
[35:15] Shumpernner technology creative
[35:18] destruction. We are destroying from the
[35:20] bottom up basis. Who can participate in
[35:23] this economy? If there's one company
[35:25] that owns everything with only one job
[35:28] that doesn't survive, capitalism doesn't
[35:30] survive. It's cannibalizing itself.
[35:32] Bitcoin is the answer. That's why it's
[35:34] you don't find Bitcoin, Bitcoin finds
[35:35] you. When you become part of it, all of
[35:38] a sudden you become realizing why you
[35:41] should because the system has left you
[35:43] behind. Bitcoin is still consolidating
[35:45] like the S&P up here just below the
[35:47] prior highs. Uh one of the main reasons
[35:51] and just so if you guys ever want to
[35:52] follow it, the open interest in you can
[35:55] see this this is the call the put open
[35:57] interest. So start from 105,000 all the
[36:01] way up. Massive calls that are expiring
[36:03] here next Friday. Uh to me this is why
[36:07] we've been stuck here is that the
[36:08] overwriting is there. That is why we
[36:10] will eventually have a short squeeze in
[36:12] my opinion when it finally does break
[36:13] higher. I don't know what the catalyst
[36:15] will be this summer but I do know the
[36:17] network effects are taking off. There
[36:19] are bits and pieces of pe this you know
[36:22] realizing that crypto is a place. So,
[36:24] Circle has just continued to move
[36:25] higher, closing the week at around 240.
[36:29] Uh, remember it was supposed to come out
[36:31] at around 30. Senate passed the stable
[36:34] coin bill. Big win for crypto industry.
[36:36] Uh, this should not should, this will
[36:39] trigger a lot of things behind it. The
[36:41] main point of that, it was bipartisan.
[36:43] You had I think 68 uh of the 98 votes
[36:46] were positive for it. That means
[36:48] Democrats were split in terms of this.
[36:51] when you get bipartisan, uh, this is
[36:53] something you want to invest in, uh, in
[36:55] a big way. Um, connecting. So, in here,
[36:58] I wanted to basically connect stable
[37:00] coin volumes
[37:02] back to the Genius Act to AI agents and
[37:05] talk about how this will do, but also
[37:08] how Ethereum should do. So, this is
[37:09] where I kind of get into this whole
[37:12] thing of looking at stable coin volumes.
[37:14] Is it an Ethereum narrative? Um, and I'm
[37:17] going to describe why this is important.
[37:20] Uh but again, stablecoin plus AI agents
[37:22] leads to acceleration of volumes and
[37:26] Ethereum has not broken out. So I don't
[37:30] want to hear from people on the crypto
[37:31] side about what innovations are better
[37:33] than Ethereum. What I want to have is
[37:36] we're at a point where stable coin
[37:37] volumes are going to be like token
[37:39] usage. They're going to grow violently
[37:40] because we have more reasoning and more
[37:42] AI agents are coming on board. You're
[37:43] going to have explosive growth in stable
[37:45] coins. uh a person who's become a friend
[37:49] sent me the bullcase for Ethereum. I
[37:51] highly recommend going to read it. Um
[37:54] not because you like Ethereum, not
[37:55] because you're going to invest in it,
[37:56] but because you need to take the next
[37:58] step past Bitcoin and you need to start
[38:00] reading about the infrastructure that's
[38:02] going to happen because stable coins and
[38:04] the usage is now a given. We're getting
[38:06] massive expansion on this. It is not
[38:09] just the government saying it. It banks
[38:11] are doing it, Walmart, Shopify, all of
[38:14] these different places are going to be
[38:15] using it. So what does it go through? So
[38:17] I basically ask a bunch of questions. Um
[38:20] tokenization is going to be a big part
[38:22] for Ethereum. That's going to happen as
[38:24] well. This was not mentioned in as well
[38:26] in the uh east meets west part of code.
[38:29] They did not spend a lot of time on
[38:31] this. They didn't talk about
[38:32] tokenization. They didn't talk about
[38:34] this. They talked about the public
[38:35] markets coming back which I completely
[38:37] disagree with. Stable coins are the
[38:39] clearest near-term accelerant of
[38:40] Ethereum demand. The Genius Act removes
[38:42] barriers enabling corporate and fintech
[38:43] deployment. as AI agents integrate will
[38:45] move from human-ledd finance to machine
[38:47] native liquidity all settling on
[38:49] Ethereum as a collateral fuel and
[38:51] digital reserve. It's poised for a
[38:52] parabolic demand shift with supply
[38:54] mechanisms design. Again, the only
[38:56] reason I'm bringing this up is because
[38:58] we're at a point now where
[39:01] at the same time that we saw reasoning
[39:03] take up, we are now seeing
[39:07] a bunch of Ethereum side in terms of
[39:11] they're building on Ethereum. So these
[39:13] are different people. So um that's this
[39:16] week. Quiet week for the markets, but
[39:18] again I'm trying to make sure I help you
[39:19] guys with understanding the impact that
[39:21] artificial intelligences have disrupting
[39:23] traditional ways of looking at the
[39:24] market. And I do believe that the jobs
[39:26] market has become the most important
[39:28] thing to be watching for the rest of
[39:29] this year. That's it for this week. See
[39:31] you next week.
