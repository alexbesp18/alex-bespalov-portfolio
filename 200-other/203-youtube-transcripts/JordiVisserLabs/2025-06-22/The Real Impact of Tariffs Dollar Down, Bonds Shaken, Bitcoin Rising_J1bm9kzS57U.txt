[00:00] Um, another week, uh, president says to
[00:04] buy stocks again. Never thought I'd, uh,
[00:07] be saying that in my, uh, career in this
[00:09] business, uh, unless I was in an
[00:12] emerging market. Uh, sentiment finally
[00:15] starting to shift, but the hard data
[00:17] continues to disappoint bears. I'll
[00:19] spend some time on that. Uh, Taiwan
[00:22] dollar spent a lot of time writing about
[00:24] it, talking about it. But I'll go into
[00:25] more details and why it's an important
[00:28] uh shift that to me is the beginning of
[00:30] a long-term trend or confirmation of a
[00:33] long-term trend. Uh rising rates and AI
[00:36] are the biggest risk. So, I'm going to
[00:38] start talking about uh what you should
[00:40] be worried about now that people are
[00:42] starting to migrate at least towards
[00:43] neutral. It's time to start looking at
[00:45] what the next um quote unquote uh
[00:48] obsession with a recession will be. And
[00:52] uh Bitcoin is approaching all-time highs
[00:54] and still very few people on Wall Street
[00:56] own it. Do not miss out on the final
[01:01] third of the video. From this point to
[01:04] the end of the year, uh AI and Bitcoin
[01:06] will be the most important stories from
[01:08] an investment standpoint. You need to uh
[01:11] look at those parts of these videos. I
[01:13] know for most uh people on Wall Street,
[01:15] they try to avoid Bitcoin. Uh not
[01:18] anymore. Uh all right. So, Trump goes
[01:21] out. I decided to use Japanese one
[01:23] translated in um just because I think
[01:25] this whole thing has now become
[01:27] hilarious. Uh he says, "Great time to
[01:29] buy on April 9th." That marks the low or
[01:31] the time that everyone uh should have
[01:33] bought. Uh people forget that on April
[01:36] 22nd, Scott Besson at a private event
[01:39] said that there'll be deescalation and
[01:42] now we have saying buy them.
[01:47] I whatever. Um, we got a trade deal
[01:50] finally. Um, that's probably why the
[01:53] market uh just consolidated this week
[01:56] because what we knew we were going to
[01:58] get, we finally got. And of course, it's
[02:00] with the two countries with the biggest
[02:02] uh current account deficits. Uh, so
[02:06] again, these arrows represent Trump says
[02:08] buy stocks. Uh, Bessant has a dinner
[02:10] with JP Morgan and says there's going to
[02:12] be a deescalation with China as we're
[02:14] starting a retest. Uh remember this was
[02:17] also after tenure rates had gone higher
[02:19] and we had a down equity down bond down
[02:24] currency week and now Trump says it here
[02:26] and again we're up against resistance
[02:28] not surprising as I said last week to
[02:30] expect some consolidation. QQQ is right
[02:33] up against the 200 day moving average.
[02:37] uh small caps continue to uh lag and as
[02:41] I've talked about higher rates and
[02:44] higher disruption from AI very big
[02:47] negative for small caps and I continue
[02:49] to believe you will see this
[02:51] uh Amazon versus everyone type thing
[02:54] that dominated from 2009 to 2019 will
[02:57] continue MCI world x the US in local
[03:01] currencies approaching the all-time
[03:03] highs after it had fallen uh again as
[03:06] the dollar weakens, remember it is a
[03:09] massive stimulus for the rest of the
[03:10] globe. Uh so I I you know it helps the
[03:14] manufacturing side here it doesn't help
[03:16] our economy uh overall but global
[03:19] liquidity that's why you're seeing all
[03:21] these global liquidity lines go up
[03:22] because over 65% of debt in the world is
[03:25] in dollars. So all these countries are
[03:28] benefiting in particular emerging
[03:29] markets. I'm not going to go through
[03:31] emerging markets in this, but I would
[03:33] definitely be long, especially Latin
[03:35] America, uh, for the rest of the year.
[03:37] Uh, breath um, makes an all-time high,
[03:40] and as this guy says, alltime highs are
[03:42] not bearish. Uh, again, the advanced
[03:44] decline line for the S&P 500 closes at
[03:47] an all-time high. And he just shows us
[03:49] other times of where we've had
[03:50] consolidations and what happens when you
[03:52] break to a new new all-time high. In the
[03:54] advanced decline, stocks are strong. We
[03:56] did see as I said sentiment has come
[03:58] down but we still have more than 50% on
[04:01] this line. So AI has barely budged uh
[04:05] but we've obviously started to see the
[04:09] systematic macro strategies put money to
[04:11] work as V has come down uh and as
[04:14] markets have gone higher. You'll
[04:15] continue to see that and then the
[04:18] NIM exposure had its largest weekly jump
[04:22] since 2024. So you are forcing people
[04:26] back in. Um again retail a major major
[04:30] buyer here along with buybacks as I'll
[04:32] go through it and the smart pencils the
[04:36] sharp pencils all selling reducing on
[04:39] the fears of smooth holly um buybacks
[04:42] massive. Uh Deutsche Bank said strong
[04:45] earnings results have seen a surge in
[04:47] buybacks. Companies do not buy back
[04:49] stocks in this amount before they start
[04:51] firing people.
[04:53] Just saying uh buybacks pace. This is
[04:57] the pace uh biggest year for buy. It's
[04:59] on pace for the biggest year in
[05:00] buybacks. Um just to get a sense as to
[05:03] the numbers in here and again you can't
[05:05] see it here. No buybacks in in the 089
[05:07] period or very very few uh COVID
[05:10] buybacks are stopped when companies are
[05:12] worried that
[05:13] uh their businesses are in trouble.
[05:16] They're not using cash to buy back
[05:17] stock. Uh
[05:20] Disney, I can't think of a place that
[05:24] basically says the economy is fine more
[05:26] than Disney. Not only uh surprising
[05:28] having a 10% up move in the stock, but
[05:31] also providing guidance that is good. Uh
[05:36] Lyft, another service company, doesn't
[05:39] see anything to worry about.
[05:42] Palanteer reported uh we're in the
[05:44] middle of a tectonic shift in the
[05:45] adoption of our software particularly in
[05:47] the US where our revenue soared 55%
[05:49] year-over-year more servicebased economy
[05:53] stuff we are delivering the operating
[05:54] system for the modern enterprise of the
[05:56] AI world hyperscalers I talked about
[05:59] them still committing uh more service
[06:01] companies that are saying we don't even
[06:03] know what you guys are talking about in
[06:05] terms of the tariffs um and just to get
[06:08] a sense as to how important these
[06:09] companies are uh of forward earnings.
[06:13] They're almost a quarter of forward
[06:15] earnings in terms of the MAG 7. So the
[06:16] MAG 7 has had a correction without the
[06:18] MAG 7. The S&P is now unchanged for the
[06:21] year. So just like breath has gone
[06:24] higher. You're basically talking about
[06:25] seven stocks that saw multiple
[06:27] compression. Um here is the chart of the
[06:29] MAG 7. I think this week if we don't get
[06:32] through the 200 day moving average and
[06:33] we see a pullback, which would not be
[06:35] surprising, uh given that in two weeks
[06:37] we have Nvidia, you'll start hearing
[06:39] people talk about this obvious head and
[06:41] shoulders formation in the MAG 7. That's
[06:43] that that would be the next thing that I
[06:45] think you'll hear about. Here is uh
[06:46] Nvidia. Uh I just want to highlight the
[06:49] before we get into this, their earnings
[06:51] are coming up in two
[06:53] weeks. Here's their earnings estimates.
[06:56] Um here's where the stock price is. This
[06:59] will be the big thing for me of when the
[07:01] final capitulation would basically come
[07:02] in because people have to remember that
[07:04] it was it was Nvidia and Deepseek that
[07:07] really started this. This the S&P was
[07:09] just about at all-time highs when
[07:11] Deepseek came out. Um and when I mean
[07:14] just about it was at all time all-time
[07:16] highs or the day before it was. Uh so
[07:18] it's we've been in kind of this
[07:20] correction since then and I think it's
[07:22] important just to realize that when
[07:23] Nvidia comes out that'll be uh an
[07:25] important kind of point where I think
[07:28] people will at that point maybe have
[07:30] thrown in everything on the tariffs and
[07:32] we'll move to something else which I'm
[07:33] going to get into in terms of Powell
[07:35] this week. you know, a lot of
[07:37] discussions, but one of the things he
[07:38] said, which I think I I really want to
[07:40] make sure people understand because
[07:42] people are talking about the economy and
[07:44] anyone who you read who writes about how
[07:46] the the economy was negative in the
[07:48] first quarter. I showed uh last week the
[07:52] breakdown and showed how strong business
[07:54] fixed investment was and that
[07:56] consumption that was lower was still
[07:59] fine. Uh that government was negative
[08:01] and then we had these two big pieces. So
[08:04] he highlighted about five times in his
[08:06] press conference the private domestic
[08:08] final purchases. So I decided to rather
[08:10] than sit there and uh let you hear it.
[08:14] Here is the the white line here is the
[08:17] final domestic demand for domestic
[08:20] purchases purchasers. So you can see how
[08:23] stable it is just sitting around 3%. And
[08:26] this here is the GB GDP quarterly. So
[08:29] you know you had negative numbers here.
[08:31] We actually did see weakness in that,
[08:33] but right now it's steady. The economy
[08:35] is completely fine. There is nothing in
[08:38] Q1 and he shouldn't be reacting. But
[08:40] this is what people are going off of. So
[08:42] I've had enough of hearing um in
[08:44] conversations from people about the
[08:47] tariffs and the fact that this is the
[08:49] highest since the 1900s. And then when I
[08:51] asked, do you know whether that means
[08:53] anything or not importantly like what's
[08:54] the size of the imports? What's the size
[08:57] of the goods part? And I this is where
[08:59] it gets troublesome because I just
[09:01] showed you three companies in the
[09:02] service side that are blowing things
[09:04] away. I could have shown you Netflix. I
[09:05] could have shown you a bunch. We are not
[09:07] an economy when we when we rode horses.
[09:11] It's not the same thing. A completely
[09:13] different time period than we were in
[09:15] the 1900s. So just to give you guys an
[09:18] idea visually of what it is, these are
[09:20] the facts. Personal
[09:22] consumption. This is the durables. This
[09:24] is the goods. Okay. It's at
[09:27] $2.3 trillion of spending in this
[09:31] country is on physical things. Here's
[09:36] what we spend on services, which is not
[09:38] part of the tariffs.
[09:40] $14.3 trillion. More importantly, just
[09:43] in the last year, it's up more than the
[09:46] entire amount here. So yeah, back in the
[09:50] early 1900s when it was probably goods
[09:52] over services or they're about the same,
[09:55] you could see where it's an important
[09:56] part when imports are such a big
[09:58] percentage of things, but also when
[10:01] there's no information, there's no
[10:02] real-time stuff. We're in totally
[10:04] different economy and it's not just in
[10:06] the spending, it's in the jobs. So just
[10:09] to make sure that we see this is the
[10:11] goods, the the payrolls of goods.
[10:16] So we've got 21 million people that work
[10:19] in the goods. That's the same level as
[10:23] 1965, 40 million to 140 million. I mean,
[10:27] this is just ludicrous to talk about in
[10:29] the way that people are where they say
[10:30] it's going to happen. So every time you
[10:32] watch a shipping thing and every time
[10:34] you hear the things of on the
[10:36] shelves, I it's all in your head. It's
[10:39] not real. I hate to say it, but it's not
[10:41] real. You're not throwing the economy
[10:43] into a recession because of tariffs. If
[10:46] earnings collapse and the stock market
[10:48] collapses, as I've said, at 200% of GDP,
[10:50] it's a problem. So, when the government
[10:52] when the president was saying he didn't
[10:53] care about the stock market, it was a
[10:55] risk. Now, he's saying buy stocks. So,
[10:58] he's changed it. Jobless claims. Again,
[11:00] if you want the real-time indicator of
[11:02] when the hard data will get bad, this is
[11:05] it. Claims. So, we got a claims number.
[11:08] I talked last week about how it had a
[11:10] little bit of a jump of 15,000 that was
[11:12] all related to New York and the
[11:13] holidays. Well, it came back off. We got
[11:15] 226. So, here's where we are. This is
[11:18] overlaid with the services PMI. So, two
[11:22] things about this. Number one, it's
[11:24] real-time indicator, meaning the claims
[11:26] will tell you when we're going into a
[11:29] recession. The services, we need to see
[11:31] massive job losses. We're not even
[11:34] seeing any at this point. zero, Zippo
[11:37] claims, no one's filing for insurance.
[11:39] So, if someone does lose a job and you
[11:41] see the challenger job cuts or any of
[11:43] these other ridiculous things, just go
[11:46] to the claims. If people aren't filing
[11:48] for unemployment insurance, there is no
[11:50] job losses. This is a real-time
[11:51] indicator. It doesn't get looked at
[11:53] enough. That'll fall down. The other
[11:55] thing to look at is look how much lower
[11:57] the services survey is compared to prior
[11:59] times. This is the recession that we're
[12:02] in. Meaning there's a good portion, the
[12:04] majority of people in this country are
[12:06] living paycheck to paycheck. We do have
[12:08] a commercial real estate recession. We
[12:09] do have a housing recession at this
[12:11] point. We have tons of places where
[12:12] there are recessions, but this is a
[12:15] service-based economy. We are not in a
[12:17] recession. And unless something changes
[12:19] dramatically, we're not going to be in
[12:21] one, and it's certainly not going to be
[12:22] from the tariffs alone. I'll get into
[12:25] points of where this could become a
[12:26] bigger issue, at least for the stock
[12:28] market, that could feed into the economy
[12:29] later. This is the weekly jobless uh
[12:32] Johnson redbook retail uh sales. Nothing
[12:36] people like zero. This is a weekly
[12:38] number that comes out. If there was
[12:40] anything important, you'd start to see
[12:42] it show up. There's nothing going on
[12:43] here. It's not only not falling, it's
[12:45] sitting near really good levels at this
[12:47] point. So, we need to see weak. Now,
[12:50] when you look for other signs,
[12:54] uh City Good and Barkley see m mountain
[12:57] of money for risky debt. And again, this
[12:59] is part of the point that I just want to
[13:01] keep making. There's too much cash
[13:03] sitting out there. We know money markets
[13:04] are up at $7 trillion. So, like just for
[13:07] the stock market alone, there's $7
[13:09] trillion sitting in 4% yielding
[13:11] instruments at this point. We still have
[13:13] massive money in checking accounts uh
[13:15] that are yielding nothing. They're
[13:18] talking about how leverage loans are the
[13:20] riskiest part of debt is there. And this
[13:21] is what the chart shows. Look, we had a
[13:23] fall with the stock market. leverage
[13:25] loans total return are already back
[13:27] above the highs. There is too much cash
[13:30] in the system looking to go to work. We
[13:32] have a problem here of a deficit with a
[13:35] debt to GDP. If the government has net
[13:38] debt every year of $2 trillion it has to
[13:40] raise. That money is going into the
[13:42] private sector. So we still have fiscal
[13:44] dominance. We still have an issue. All
[13:45] right. Canary in the coal mine Taiwanese
[13:47] dollar. Um this is a chart all the way
[13:50] back to 19 I think it goes back to 84.
[13:54] um two-day move, massive. So, we come in
[14:00] Monday, this is out there. I write a
[14:03] paper on it um because I want to
[14:05] highlight to people why it's important
[14:06] for me uh in terms of having been there
[14:09] when the Taiwanese dollar did this. This
[14:14] was in
[14:16] 1998. This was during LTCM. This is
[14:19] while I was in Brazil. This had been the
[14:22] end of a very large problem in the globe
[14:25] in terms of the emerging market crisis.
[14:27] And from that point as I I go through in
[14:29] here this is when the recycling of
[14:31] dollars started. So at that time we had
[14:34] a big change in global markets where the
[14:37] Asian countries all many of them had
[14:41] currency breaks they had their
[14:42] currencies um or peg currency breaks.
[14:45] They had their currencies under
[14:46] pressure. Everyone out there started to
[14:48] hoard what was gold at that time which
[14:50] was dollar reserves. So the dollar
[14:53] started being purchased in great size to
[14:55] defend against the next time this chart
[14:58] here which is from John Ro at 22V. He
[15:01] and I did a webinar this week. Uh reach
[15:03] out to your salesperson at 22V if you
[15:05] want to go through it. It's an important
[15:06] one in my mind because we go through
[15:09] China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore,
[15:12] Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines. All of
[15:15] the currencies are sending the exact
[15:17] same me message. It is an unwind of what
[15:20] had happened a long time ago in terms of
[15:22] the Asian currencies. Now what drove the
[15:24] Taiwanese side? Taiwan insurers clash
[15:27] over hedging as currency rallies. This
[15:29] has been a a major thing in the fact
[15:31] that Asia has had tons and tons of
[15:35] dollars uh and purchases over the years
[15:38] since that period. Dollar faces 2.5
[15:40] trillion avalanche of Asian sales.
[15:42] Steven Lee Jen. I work with Stephen Lee
[15:44] Jen at Morgan Stanley. We do a regular
[15:47] call, myself, Stephen, and and five
[15:50] other partners. He is one of the best,
[15:52] if not the best, on currencies out
[15:54] there. Um, and he's talking about Asian
[15:57] countries may unwind their large
[15:59] stockpile of dollars, potentially
[16:00] triggering a $2.5 trillion avalanche of
[16:02] selling that poses sharp downside risk
[16:04] to the dollar. That's what John and I
[16:06] were going through. The charts are
[16:07] saying that's going to happen. I believe
[16:09] that's absolutely going to happen. And I
[16:11] think there's more to this to come. Now,
[16:13] uh I do want to say right now because
[16:15] the sentiment in the dollar uh is is
[16:18] very negative. Uh I don't think that's
[16:21] going to matter this year. I also don't
[16:23] think it's going to collapse. I think
[16:24] when I get in through some of the things
[16:26] I'm going to show, there's other things
[16:28] to focus on for this year. Uh, I do want
[16:30] to bring up that Stephen is talking
[16:32] about he he's the architect of what's
[16:35] called the dollar smile which would
[16:36] happen in markets when we'd have a
[16:39] global recession. Dollar would
[16:41] appreciate if the US growth and yields
[16:44] were going through. Dollar would
[16:45] appreciate and this is the time that the
[16:47] dollar would depreciate. And this was
[16:48] normally coming out of a recession or
[16:50] some kind of a cyclical upswing when
[16:53] everybody was coming out in a
[16:54] synchronized manner. Well, now he's
[16:56] turning this into maybe we're going into
[16:58] a dollar frown. I happen to believe and
[17:00] this is where the dollar is going to be
[17:01] on the sell side for either of these
[17:03] things. If we have a recession, it
[17:05] probably goes down. And the root cause
[17:08] at the end of the day, it's no longer a
[17:09] safe haven. And I think that's what's
[17:11] gone on with losing the global currency
[17:14] reserve. The dollar is no longer gold.
[17:16] And that's what you have to keep
[17:17] thinking about. Taiwan dollar rises
[17:19] fastest pace in decades, threatening
[17:21] tech profits. Remember, we have
[17:23] benefited from a strong dollar against
[17:27] the rest of the world. and the rest of
[17:28] the world has suffered from a strong
[17:31] dollar. So now with a weakening dollar,
[17:33] you're going to get global growth which
[17:35] will be strong outside of the country
[17:38] relative to inside. But one of the
[17:40] places is we benefited from the dollar
[17:42] on tech profits in terms of being able
[17:44] to import stuff especially from Taiwan
[17:47] uh for cheaper levels than we obviously
[17:50] would. Remember uh when you look at oil
[17:52] around the globe or any commodity
[17:55] they're priced in dollars. So if the
[17:56] dollar is weakening for a foreign
[17:58] investor, their commodities are getting
[18:00] cheaper, which means their competition,
[18:02] their ability to compete with US uh is
[18:06] is is better than it's been. So you're
[18:07] going to start to see some productivity
[18:09] changes. This is part of the reason why
[18:11] the foreign markets are outperforming
[18:13] the US. But I just want to keep it in
[18:14] the back of people's mind because the
[18:16] dollar moving against Asia has just
[18:18] started. Um Brad Satzer uh has done a
[18:23] ton of stuff. He probably had the best
[18:25] interview of the week in terms of Taiwan
[18:28] and understanding it better. So, worth
[18:30] going. And again, just to highlight,
[18:31] Asian dollar made its
[18:33] low on Jan 13th uh of this year, but
[18:38] then we retested it two weeks ago. This
[18:41] has just started. Um, this is a
[18:43] long-term trend, and when the Asian
[18:44] dollar is rallying, different things are
[18:46] going on. Uh, if you take the trade
[18:48] weighted dollar, that also just peaked.
[18:50] I just want to show this back to 1971.
[18:53] This is uh the Breton Woods uh
[18:56] situation. We got off the gold standard.
[18:57] This is what the dollar has done on a
[18:58] trade weighted basis. We just made the
[19:00] high. John and I went through all these
[19:02] divergences here, meaning RSIs were
[19:04] going down. So, I think this is a peak.
[19:07] I think this is going to lead to a
[19:08] long-term change. Now, what you notice
[19:10] is these things never collapse. So,
[19:13] don't look for some straight line down,
[19:15] but I do believe that something needs to
[19:17] go on with the Chinese yuan. I think it
[19:19] should be revalued or it should be let
[19:21] to float stronger maybe down to six and
[19:23] a half. That would absolutely have an
[19:25] impact here. Move this down into here. I
[19:27] think a a weakening dollar has become a
[19:30] bigger part of the equation. Uh Ken
[19:32] Rogoff has a new book out. Uh I've
[19:34] listened to four podcasts with him over
[19:36] the course of the last week. Uh I like
[19:39] him a lot. Uh never really knew who he
[19:41] was before the podcast. This is one of
[19:42] the benefits of podcast. I love the fact
[19:44] that he was a chess player. I love the
[19:45] fact that he dropped out of college a
[19:47] couple times. uh hated high school uh
[19:49] resonates with me and part of the reason
[19:52] was he has an ability to change his
[19:55] mind. He's not some thesis person that
[19:57] comes up with one thesis. He talks
[19:59] openly in the podcast about some of the
[20:01] things that Trump's doing that are good.
[20:03] He wrote this book before Trump was
[20:05] elected. Uh basically saying our dollar
[20:08] you're a problem using a line from
[20:09] history. Uh but he goes through a lot of
[20:11] the reasons why this is a problem. Uh
[20:14] it's more balanced than Ray Dalio's um
[20:17] stuff that he puts out trying to sell
[20:18] books and whatever else reason he's
[20:20] doing. He has a thesis he's had for a
[20:22] long time. So uh whatever Ray is trying
[20:24] to do, at least Ken's being balanced in
[20:26] this key points on interest rates and
[20:29] reserve uh reserve currency status. This
[20:31] is where I want to go through because
[20:32] one of the things Ken Rogoff mentions is
[20:35] that when you lose the global reserve
[20:37] currency status, uh your interest rates
[20:40] are going to start to move higher.
[20:41] you've had the benefit of rates being
[20:43] lower than they otherwise should be. And
[20:45] again, the dollar was gold. Uh, and for
[20:49] Asian countries, they needed dollars to
[20:51] protect against the next crisis. And
[20:54] when they got those dollars, they would
[20:56] go into the market and buy treasuries.
[20:58] And that would keep rates on everything
[21:00] lower than expected. I I I talked about
[21:02] how that had an impact on the great
[21:04] financial crisis because every garbage
[21:06] mortgage with any kind to anybody was
[21:09] able to be sold to someone. And part of
[21:11] the reason why was there was endless
[21:12] demand from Asia that led to that
[21:14] crisis. So these things all talk about
[21:17] you you get the ability to run large
[21:19] deficits. That's what we got. Um but if
[21:22] the world begins to diverse away from
[21:23] the dollar due to
[21:24] geopolitics, sanctions, overreach,
[21:26] that's what we're going through right
[21:27] now with the tariffs. Demand for
[21:29] treasuries could fall and interest rates
[21:31] could rise suddenly and sharply. We
[21:34] obviously saw that a few weeks ago. I'm
[21:36] going to go through that. interest rates
[21:37] as a canary in the final chapters
[21:39] rograph suggested of long-term rates
[21:40] start rising independent of Fed hikes.
[21:43] So again, Fed cut rates in September.
[21:46] What happened to long-term rates? They
[21:48] went higher. Tenure rates were down at
[21:50] 360 when the Fed lowered 50 basis points
[21:53] in September. We are now up at 440 in
[21:56] tenure yields. It may be an early sign
[21:58] that the dollar's privilege is eroding.
[22:00] This is the most important story in
[22:02] markets. This is the most important
[22:04] story for you to pay attention to. When
[22:06] I was in Brazil, that's this line here.
[22:08] This is June of 97. I talked about this
[22:11] on the video with John Ro. Um the orange
[22:15] line here is tenure rates. The white
[22:16] line here is nominal GDP in the US. What
[22:18] you can see is that from 1980 up until
[22:22] 97, tenure rates were always above
[22:25] year-over-year nominal GDP by about 100
[22:27] to 150 basis points. And then when the
[22:30] Thai bot happened and we started seeing
[22:32] the breaking of all of the Asian
[22:34] currencies, pegs and markets, they
[22:37] started buying the hell out of dollars
[22:39] and building up reserves. And what
[22:41] changed was now 10ear rates traded under
[22:44] nominal GDP for the entire time and they
[22:47] are about to cross and they will cross.
[22:50] And when they do cross, it will be a
[22:51] major event. This is the change that's
[22:53] happening. Rates are migrating back at
[22:55] least into something in my mind that is
[22:58] half of this. we will start having
[23:00] tenure rates above because you've lost
[23:02] the global reserve currency status. This
[23:04] is the most important story. It has huge
[23:06] implications for the US market. It is
[23:08] not positive in general for the stuff
[23:10] that has worked. I will make the
[23:12] argument it is positive for what Donald
[23:13] Trump wants which is a redistribution.
[23:16] So let's go back to Besson's uh
[23:19] confirmation hearing. Uh he noted upon
[23:22] his confirmation in January rates had
[23:24] spiked to a 5% level. he describes as
[23:26] potentially uncomfortable for the
[23:28] economy particularly regarding mortgage
[23:29] rates and capital capital
[23:31] formation. Remember these things. He
[23:34] also
[23:37] said he uh when asked about inflation he
[23:42] addressed concerns about the
[23:43] inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs.
[23:45] He argued that the appreciation of the
[23:48] US dollar appreciation would offset much
[23:51] of the potential price increase. He
[23:53] explained that in a classical economic
[23:56] model, a 10% tariff could lead to a 4%
[23:58] appreciation of the dollar. This
[24:00] currency appreciation would in turn
[24:02] reduce the cost of imports, mitigating
[24:04] the inflationary effects. He gets into
[24:06] the specifics. He said, well, the
[24:08] producers might absorb 4%. And that
[24:10] would leave only a 2% increase. The
[24:13] problem is the dollar has not done this.
[24:15] It has depreciated by more than the 4%.
[24:18] This is the Steven Mirren thing. This is
[24:20] what he said. the the Harvard trained
[24:23] economist. This is a classical model.
[24:26] Models will only get you in trouble,
[24:28] especially when they are garbage. Um,
[24:31] remember hundred trillion dollars of
[24:33] global debt. So, this is not just a US
[24:34] problem. But the problem is the US rate
[24:36] is the benchmark rate. Everything in the
[24:39] world is priced off of US rates. We have
[24:41] a hundred trillion dollars of debt and
[24:44] 40% of it matures by
[24:47] 2027. Remember, rates are the most
[24:49] important thing. And the reason I said
[24:51] the Taiwanese dollar was a canary coal
[24:53] mine. It wasn't the first canary. So
[24:56] here's the problem. JGB yields, 30-year
[24:59] JGB yields going up. They made new highs
[25:02] this week. So it's not just the US.
[25:05] Japan, we hear about how it's not
[25:07] impacting their world that they have
[25:08] debt to GDP of 240%. It is. Their market
[25:11] is going through it. We have a bare
[25:13] market in bonds that is happening.
[25:14] Remember, 30-year rates in the US had
[25:16] this historic move back three weeks ago.
[25:21] So, these have been warning signs that
[25:23] something bad is going on. Um, this
[25:26] comes only 5 years after a speech by
[25:28] Olivia Blanchard on how public debt
[25:31] doesn't matter. People forget that
[25:32] people that very, very smart quote
[25:35] unquote smart people were talking about
[25:36] how the size of the debt doesn't matter.
[25:40] You can just keep printing as much money
[25:41] as you want. it doesn't matter unless
[25:43] you actually get rates to move higher
[25:46] and that's where we are and that's what
[25:47] Ken Rogoff talked about. He actually
[25:48] talks about it in there. I also want to
[25:51] remind people that we still have this
[25:52] going on at the time and this is why at
[25:54] the end when I go through Bitcoin it's
[25:56] obvious what's what's happening but the
[26:00] Fed again is still buying at this point
[26:04] or you know in auctions because they
[26:06] have debt maturing and that money is
[26:09] just getting recycled back. The balance
[26:11] sheet is only shrinking slightly now
[26:13] because of QT, but remember we've
[26:15] reduced it significantly. So I bring
[26:17] this up because eventually you're going
[26:19] to be in a position without any doubt in
[26:22] my mind that the government's going to
[26:23] have to get involved if rates start
[26:25] going higher. And that's what I would
[26:26] expect is going to start to become an
[26:28] issue. Luke Groman talked about it. Um
[26:31] he's been saying all year, we either
[26:32] need rates to go higher, we need there
[26:35] to be a devaluation of the dollar, and
[26:36] then the Fed will have to come in and
[26:38] put pressure. We're kind of in that
[26:40] cycle now. Now that we're getting
[26:41] through the recession fears, you're
[26:43] starting to finally see people talk
[26:45] about this Goldman forecast for US
[26:48] inflation as dollar slides. People are
[26:49] starting to realize that as the dollar
[26:51] comes down, it adds to inflation. Um, go
[26:54] look at the inflation that Brazil's been
[26:56] fighting as their currency has weakened.
[26:58] So, they're now raising their PCE
[27:01] forecasts up to 3.8
[27:04] uh and then coming back to 27. They were
[27:07] at 35 and 23. So this is not the
[27:09] tariffs. Uh the tariffs are already
[27:11] included in there, but now you're
[27:12] getting the other boost from the dollar.
[27:14] Uh inflation expectations are moving
[27:17] higher. So again, not all of these are
[27:20] related to the politics. I'm sure
[27:22] there's politics in involved in all of
[27:24] them, but the reality is there will be a
[27:26] boost from tariff in terms of inflation.
[27:28] And now that you have the dollar going,
[27:30] I'll go through other risks that are
[27:31] there. But you've got inflation
[27:33] expectations that are moving higher.
[27:34] That was a bunch of survey uh surveys in
[27:37] terms of consumer confidence Michigan
[27:39] and the New York Fed consumer survey.
[27:42] This one is from companies though. So
[27:44] this is the survey uh of regional uh
[27:47] PMIs and just what's happening. So
[27:50] you've got this as an average one.
[27:52] They're all moving higher and this is on
[27:53] paid and received. One angle that
[27:57] people, you know, and Trump has talked
[27:59] about which is not going to work out in
[28:00] the end is this whole thing with crude.
[28:02] I think it should be noted that we got
[28:05] this quote unquote surprise release of
[28:07] more production from OPEC plus and by
[28:11] the end of the week crude was up. Um I
[28:13] like trying to find things where
[28:15] sentiment is bearish in something and
[28:16] you get a story that should make it
[28:19] happen. You could say the same thing for
[28:21] stocks this week. They didn't go higher
[28:22] and we had the president say to buy. So
[28:24] wouldn't surprise me if next week we
[28:26] have more of a weak week uh just because
[28:28] we saw the opposite of what you would
[28:30] expect to see. good news that turned
[28:32] into no price move. Well, in crude, we
[28:35] sold off or we had bad news and we
[28:37] didn't sell off. Now, the white line
[28:39] here is gas at the pump. This is the
[28:41] thing that really matters from the
[28:43] perspective of CPI. So, I believe that
[28:46] by the end of the year, power shortages
[28:48] are going to be a major story in terms
[28:50] of swaps. Uh this is inflation
[28:53] expectations, two-year inflation
[28:55] expectations and tips. Uh we're at the
[28:58] highs. So, we saw stocks fall. We saw
[29:01] crude fall and yet this thing just sits
[29:04] near the highs and it's basically at the
[29:06] highest level in two years. So the
[29:09] market's expecting inflation to be an
[29:11] issue. Now in terms of the debt and the
[29:14] reason rate should also start to go
[29:15] higher. Uh this isn't getting enough
[29:18] attention but uh Elon Musk discovers
[29:20] that serious spending cuts are really
[29:22] difficult. Uh Doge basically is really
[29:26] not doing anything. And again, the
[29:28] entitlement spending is not only up
[29:30] here, but it's growing rapidly. So, if
[29:33] we can't cut the interest expense, and
[29:35] the deficit, if the deficit's not going
[29:37] to get better, then the interest expense
[29:38] isn't going to get better unless the Fed
[29:40] cuts rates. I think the Fed cutting
[29:42] rates would trigger another move higher
[29:45] in long-term yield. So, I think a
[29:46] steepening of the yield curve is the
[29:48] issue we have because of what I've shown
[29:50] you in terms of where we are. There's
[29:53] one other issue for bonds globally right
[29:55] now and I don't know what of this is
[29:58] true or not. Um but we've heard this
[30:02] many times now in terms of this
[30:04] restructuring of US debt to maybe longer
[30:07] maturities or maybe and lower
[30:10] coupons. The fact that a sitting US
[30:12] treasury secretary is speaking publicly
[30:13] about the fault you cause foreigners to
[30:15] dump treasuries. I could not agree more.
[30:16] I've said this on my trips that if we're
[30:19] even talking about this, why would you
[30:20] own this stuff? move move to gold and
[30:22] Bitcoin as fast as you can and I think
[30:25] these are the risks. This is not the
[30:27] stock market risk. So, let's just put
[30:28] them all together and see how good this
[30:30] is for interest rate. Right now,
[30:31] everyone's worried about recession
[30:32] fears. So, theoretically rates should be
[30:34] moving lower. They're not. Tariffs
[30:37] definitely has short-term inflation
[30:38] pressure, weaker dollar inflation
[30:40] pressure. the tax cuts if we get some
[30:42] through and let's just assume he puts
[30:44] higher taxes on wealthy and gives more
[30:47] tax cuts or money to an enormous amount
[30:51] of people the bottom 90% I view that as
[30:54] inflationary not disinflationary because
[30:56] I don't think it's going to change the
[30:58] spending habits of the wealthy of of
[30:59] above 2 and a half million uh but I do
[31:02] believe that for tax cuts possibly to
[31:05] zero for the bottom 90 huge huge impact
[31:07] in terms of creating more stimulus or
[31:10] more uh purchasing of stuff just like we
[31:12] saw with the stimmies. Uh AI power
[31:15] shortage coming in the second half of
[31:16] the year. Don't fade it. Just realize
[31:18] that electricity prices and stuff are
[31:20] going higher. Doge found raindrops in
[31:23] the ocean. The deficit still there. Debt
[31:25] to GDP. Economists that said it didn't
[31:27] matter. That's still sitting there at
[31:30] 120%. We have a synchronized problem in
[31:32] global debt maturity. We have rising
[31:34] inflation expectations. You're starting
[31:36] Asia repatriation on the benchmark bond.
[31:38] We're already trading 200 basis points
[31:41] below where we were before. I think we
[31:43] will at least migrate back above. Uh
[31:46] talking about restructuring the debt,
[31:47] JGB yields, the country that has always
[31:51] led us in terms of what's been going on
[31:52] with rates is making the highest level
[31:55] this century. And Germany and China are
[31:58] spending money for the first time that I
[32:00] don't know during my career. So, um,
[32:03] let's just say there's enough reasons to
[32:05] be bearish bonds that that should be
[32:07] where the bears are. Now, the impact
[32:09] that this will have, you're seeing elite
[32:10] colleges lead a rush for the exits of
[32:12] private equity. How does this fit in,
[32:14] Jordy? Well, I'm going to show you why
[32:16] this is important. The US is the leader
[32:18] on the globe of longduration assets.
[32:21] What are longduration assets? VC
[32:23] investments, private equity, high growth
[32:24] tech stocks. If I'm right and if rates
[32:27] are moving higher, this has huge
[32:28] implications for countries around the
[32:30] world that have benefited from the low
[32:31] rates. The US has benefited the most by
[32:34] dominating in VC, private equity,
[32:36] technology stocks. We saw what happened
[32:38] in 2022 to all of them. These two have
[32:41] not recovered. These did because of AI,
[32:44] but they will be under pressure if rates
[32:46] are going higher because the pressure on
[32:50] future discounted cash flows with higher
[32:53] long-term rates become an issue. These
[32:55] assets flourish in low interest rate
[32:57] environments as we saw post08 when rates
[33:00] rise like in 2020. Long duration assets
[33:02] get hit hard because of future cash
[33:03] flows are discounted more heavily. This
[33:05] has contributed to volatility in the
[33:06] tech sector and VC valuations.
[33:09] Now here is the chart of the
[33:13] Moody's investment grade yield which is
[33:16] 6 and a4% as of Friday. Here is the
[33:20] earnings yield in the S&P only yielding
[33:21] you 4.6%. So there's already a massive
[33:24] gap, meaning bonds are a better
[33:26] investment than stocks. If stocks start
[33:28] to go sideways, and again since 2021, if
[33:32] you take it since this period in 2021
[33:34] when we started this movement higher,
[33:37] S&P has produced 6% annualized returns.
[33:40] Now, this is during two great years
[33:42] here. So I'm one of these people that is
[33:44] not positive on stocks going forward
[33:47] because we are exposed to longduration
[33:50] assets. We are synthetically benefiting
[33:52] from yields trading low and I think bond
[33:55] yields are going higher. So the other
[34:00] problem is that we dominate coding. We
[34:04] dominate tech and we have another
[34:06] competitor coming. This is all the
[34:08] negatives for us relative to the rest of
[34:09] the globe. But for all of you sitting in
[34:11] tech stocks and on things built on code,
[34:15] good luck with your alpha. I think it's
[34:17] going to be harder and harder because I
[34:18] think there's going to be competition
[34:19] from AI. I've talked about this. So,
[34:22] these are the things that go you're
[34:23] getting a harder and harder period to
[34:26] do. AI tools are widely accessible. So,
[34:29] competition, talent and ideas are
[34:31] globalized. Product lifespan shrink. I'm
[34:33] going to show something on this from the
[34:35] when I go into the next one. But VC
[34:38] funds have to pivot faster. I've talked
[34:39] about three 100 billion companies
[34:42] becoming 3001 billion companies. more
[34:45] private companies that never go public.
[34:47] The entire capital structure of the
[34:49] world is
[34:51] changing. And this is the reason why I'm
[34:53] going to give you three videos that you
[34:55] have as homework that you really should
[34:57] watch from this point. Especially the
[34:59] people on Wall Street who don't want to
[35:01] learn new things. These three will tell
[35:03] you what the capital structure of the
[35:05] world's going to look like. Stripe
[35:06] sessions, the keynote speech, 49
[35:09] minutes. Go look at that.
[35:11] And I'll go through and show some charts
[35:13] as to why Stripe is a unicorn, one of
[35:15] the largest in the world. Uh it is part
[35:17] of the global uh payment system in terms
[35:20] of what the payment system is going to
[35:21] look like. Michael Sailor, check your
[35:24] Ponzi scheme hats at the door and go
[35:26] watch his speech and look at what he's
[35:28] talking about. This is the truth.
[35:30] Capital markets are unhealthy, full of
[35:32] zombie companies. The majority of
[35:34] companies in the US are zombie
[35:36] companies, just like they were in
[35:38] Japan. You have to go see. They can't
[35:40] beat the S&P. About 30% of companies are
[35:42] beating the S&P index because there's
[35:44] only seven companies that were actually
[35:46] going. I showed you small cap. All of
[35:49] the stuff he's talking about in here is
[35:51] absolutely true. And he's talking about
[35:52] a capital structure which will change.
[35:54] The third one, this is Peter Demandis.
[35:57] Caught him at a really good spot. Um the
[35:59] trillion dollar AI reset. There's so
[36:02] much good alpha in this about what the
[36:04] future is going to look like. He does
[36:05] this um regular conversation with uh
[36:09] with Salem, but he also did one with
[36:10] Dave Blondon. You really should go
[36:13] listen to it because he goes through a
[36:16] ton of things in there about what the
[36:17] future's going to look like. Here is uh
[36:21] the most important chart that you'll see
[36:22] in terms of the competition for tech
[36:24] stocks. So, Stripe, which basically is
[36:27] the, you know, the the has access to all
[36:30] of the data of startup businesses in
[36:32] this country. anyone that's doing uh
[36:34] anything where they're using stable
[36:36] coins, where they're using payment
[36:37] service, remember these guys are massive
[36:39] now and they're growing rapidly. Uh this
[36:42] was the most interesting chart. So this
[36:44] is how long it took to get 5 million ARR
[36:47] for a SAS
[36:49] company. This is how long it took for
[36:52] the AI
[36:53] 100. This is what it's taking now for
[36:56] the new AI. So I just want you to
[36:58] realize the competition is happening so
[37:00] fast. These companies are scaling so
[37:03] rapidly. The other thing he says is the
[37:06] retention collapses. So it's not just
[37:09] how fast they get to this number, they
[37:11] also peter out faster and they collapse
[37:13] faster. People move on to a new tool.
[37:16] That is the world we're in. When you see
[37:17] your kids and you're like, I don't
[37:19] understand how this kid is playing video
[37:20] games all the time or why they're
[37:22] gambling or why they're doing uh
[37:24] whatever gaming all the time. It's a
[37:27] completely different world and it's not
[37:28] about 65year-olds anymore. It's changing
[37:31] number of businesses growing from 1
[37:33] million to 10 million ARR per month.
[37:35] This is not a bare market. This is not a
[37:38] recession people. These are businesses
[37:40] that are growing rapidly in front of
[37:43] your eyes. You have to pay attention to
[37:45] what's going on in these markets. So
[37:47] from that Peter Diamandez thing they
[37:50] talk about the inference revolution is
[37:52] outpacing Moore's law. We are moving at
[37:55] such a fast pace here. It's unthinkable
[37:58] where we will be in a year. If you watch
[38:00] the Stripe thing, they're doing things
[38:02] with cursor. Cursor now has 300 million
[38:05] in ARR. I mentioned them, I think my
[38:07] first video last summer, having built my
[38:10] first app ever from natural language
[38:12] processing. He Patrick Collison does
[38:14] that on stage in the Stripe side. Eric
[38:17] Schmidt powering the world. I've talked
[38:18] about this. We don't have enough power
[38:20] for the AI. Everyone saying AI is
[38:24] overhyped is missing the fact that it's
[38:26] not only underhyped, it's accelerating
[38:27] at such a fast pace. And then AI agents,
[38:30] they go through the whole thing of where
[38:31] we are on this. Again, these guys are
[38:34] just talking about what the future's
[38:35] going to look like. Every time you look
[38:37] at a tariff chart from the 1800s and the
[38:40] 1900s, think about what you're doing.
[38:42] That is not the future. That is the
[38:44] past. Hundreds years ago, people riding
[38:46] horses. Um, Visa, Mastercard, offer
[38:50] support for AI agents. This just
[38:52] continues. It won't stop. Now he has
[38:55] this very interesting thing and I was
[38:56] thinking of writing a paper on what the
[38:58] new global reserve currency will be and
[39:00] the fact that it is borderless. That is
[39:03] what crypto is about. It is borderless.
[39:04] It is outside the system of the
[39:06] government. It has already won. He talks
[39:09] about the borderless financial services
[39:11] meaning these companies that are all
[39:12] going across borders using stable coins.
[39:16] So bridge which is a company they
[39:19] purchased this is their payment volume
[39:21] growth. This is bridge is doing
[39:23] crossborder payments. So this is
[39:25] allowing kids in Brazil to sell to
[39:28] Americans to do this
[39:30] all using stable
[39:33] coins. Here's the growth. This is
[39:35] Stripe's growth down here for the first
[39:38] 24 months. This is how fast they're
[39:39] growing relative to what Stripe, which
[39:41] is a unicorn. And they purchased Bridge.
[39:44] This is the the major story that's gone.
[39:46] A uh Andre's Andre Horowitz, stable
[39:50] coins may be crypto's first killer app.
[39:52] Real shot at making it so sending money
[39:54] is more like sending an email. Uh
[39:56] greater stable coin adoption can
[39:58] significantly lower cost for Walmart,
[40:01] for Chipotle, for Kroger. Stable coins
[40:05] all part of it. Stable coin launched in
[40:07] 100 countries. Ramp I talked about how
[40:10] it can be used anywhere in the world.
[40:12] Internet capital markets are being built
[40:14] in real time and it's pretty damn cool.
[40:16] Internet capital markets, again, the
[40:19] public market, the way that you invest
[40:21] has changed. If you want to invest in
[40:22] the new world, here it is, guys. Bitcoin
[40:25] approaching all-time highs. This is
[40:27] going to be a year that you will
[40:28] remember and be forced to deal with
[40:30] Bitcoin because you have nothing else to
[40:32] invest in. It's not going to work with
[40:34] miners and Coinbase and all this other
[40:37] stuff. You have to put the work in and
[40:39] start understanding why this is not what
[40:41] you read in the paper like the tariffs
[40:43] and the recessions uh from the people
[40:45] out there. You have to go spend the
[40:46] time. It's an ecosystem that's growing
[40:49] and Bitcoin is getting more adoption and
[40:51] it will continue to go. But at some
[40:52] point this year, we're going to run into
[40:53] a problem because I think we're going to
[40:54] have a squeeze. I talked about that on
[40:57] uh this week's uh video with Anthony
[41:00] Pompiano. Uh 19 straight days of Bitcoin
[41:04] ETF inflows. 19 during a market where
[41:08] people are bearish. So, Bitcoin, plenty
[41:11] of adoption on the ETF side. So, just
[41:14] think about who's buying it. We won't
[41:16] find out. More institutions are buying
[41:18] it. Growing institutional adoption of
[41:20] crypto. You've got massive deals that
[41:22] have happened uh in in uh issuance. You
[41:25] had the Howard Lutnik thing. Uh you've
[41:27] got a bunch of spaxs coming out. You've
[41:29] got Sailor doing what he's doing,
[41:31] raising to buy more. OC approves banks
[41:33] to embrace Bitcoin. Regulatory shift
[41:35] boost crypto
[41:37] adoption. Uh Coinbase in one of the
[41:40] largest crypto deals, $2.9 billion deal
[41:43] for major crypto options platform
[41:45] Derbit. Um I talked about how there's no
[41:47] deals happening in the US or IPOs that's
[41:50] going on. All this is happening and look
[41:53] at Bitcoin in Google trends. Not a
[41:56] single care in the world by people. Uh
[41:58] this is the kind of stuff you want to
[41:59] see in bull markets. you want to see
[42:01] massive breakout through all-time highs
[42:04] while the equity market is doing nothing
[42:06] and no one's paying attention uh for
[42:08] stable coins and other digital assets to
[42:10] thrive. This is uh Bessant responding to
[42:13] the fact that Senate did not approve the
[42:16] Genius Act for at this point for the
[42:18] stable coin bill. Uh this will lead
[42:20] again to backlash against Democrats. The
[42:23] Democrats are the one who voted against
[42:24] moving forward on it. I I don't
[42:26] understand how a political party can
[42:27] commit suicide uh constantly, but good
[42:30] luck to trying to fight a huge majority
[42:33] of people in this country that are
[42:34] benefiting from the growth in Bitcoin.
[42:36] Uh 30 million users here, more people
[42:39] involved in it. It gives people hope. My
[42:41] kids have Bitcoin reserves. Like I I I
[42:44] just don't know how you sit there and
[42:45] make decisions based on on uh on wanting
[42:49] to control things uh when this is
[42:51] happening whether it's here around the
[42:53] globe. New Hampshire first in the nation
[42:55] to strategic Bitcoin reserve. So we have
[42:57] our first state. Arizona half in half
[43:01] half out, but the governor did sign a
[43:02] law for state to keep unclaimed crypto.
[43:05] So it's a move in the right direction.
[43:07] Uh JD Vance will be speaking uh at Vegas
[43:10] this month in Bitcoin 2025. So again,
[43:13] there'll be more news coming out in the
[43:14] next couple weeks. Morgan Stanley says,
[43:16] "Bitcoin has sufficient market cap to be
[43:18] a US government reserve asset,
[43:20] suggesting a $370 billion allocation.
[43:23] Remember, it wasn't that long ago Morgan
[43:25] Stanley wouldn't even talk about
[43:26] Bitcoin." Uh, all this is changing. I'm
[43:28] going to keep bringing this up every
[43:30] week that there's more news on it. Van,
[43:33] uh, if not the preeminent, one of the
[43:35] preeminent houses in terms of research
[43:36] on crypto, introduced a 110 billion bit
[43:40] bonds proposal to help the US government
[43:42] acquire more Bitcoin and refinance part
[43:44] of its national debt. I talked about bit
[43:46] bonds last week and just to finish off
[43:48] uh from the page six merchants of cons
[43:52] before the cons film festival will start
[43:54] accepting Bitcoin and crypto this
[43:56] summer. All right, that's it from me. Uh
[43:58] remember tariffs are from the uh 18 and
[44:01] early 1900s and Bitcoin and AI are
[44:05] today. Stop looking at your tariff
[44:07] stuff. Start realizing this is a
[44:09] service-based economy. I'll see you next
[44:12] week.
