[00:00] anymore but uh every week's going to be
[00:01] a busy week I guess under uh under the
[00:04] new Administration so uh Market recap
[00:07] sentiment just continues to get worse
[00:10] um tariff redwork actually died down
[00:12] this this week and I think that's
[00:14] important and I'll discuss why uh the
[00:16] FED is back with the word transitory
[00:18] again uh Great Scott Besson interview I
[00:21] think which uh will allow me to continue
[00:24] uh emphasizing the most important part
[00:26] of this year is that there will not be a
[00:27] recession so markets can trade low
[00:30] but if you have no recession you should
[00:32] expect anything that goes down to be a
[00:33] buying opportunity before the end of the
[00:35] year meaning we'll rally before the end
[00:37] of the year Soft Data versus hard data
[00:39] um China's getting more aggressive uh
[00:42] most of this is because of trump so he's
[00:46] gotten Europe to spend and China
[00:47] continues to do more probably the most
[00:49] important thing of the week was the GTC
[00:52] 2hour keynote speech by Jensen Huang
[00:55] it's not going to get uh as much
[00:57] attention as the the BS of people
[01:00] worrying about tariffs but the reality
[01:02] is reality and then I'm going to start
[01:04] to spend a lot more time uh on bitcoin
[01:07] and the structural components that are
[01:09] going to come out of this which is where
[01:10] I want everyone to focus uh remember you
[01:12] have a job to do your job is to invest
[01:15] it's to make money and worrying about
[01:18] things uh in the temporary that are
[01:21] orchestrated by a government trying to
[01:23] do something you have to pay attention
[01:26] and still be in a position to do your
[01:27] homework this is the most important time
[01:29] to do your homework homework and I go
[01:30] through some of the changes that I think
[01:32] we're at an inflection point because
[01:33] I've mentioned we are at a regime regime
[01:35] change I think it's critical and I think
[01:37] the markets are discounting it so first
[01:40] spy we're still below the 200 day um
[01:43] you're going to read a lot about death
[01:44] crosses as you've got a bunch of 50-day
[01:46] moving averages uh getting close to 200
[01:49] day this is the 20-day which is crossing
[01:51] over but for NVIDIA and stuff like that
[01:53] you've got a lot of things going on but
[01:55] the S&P is below the 200 day but what
[01:57] you will notice is four of the five days
[01:59] last week and five of the last six we're
[02:02] starting to show some strength even if
[02:04] it's just rallying at the end of the day
[02:05] or getting back above the opening price
[02:07] we've done that now five of the last six
[02:09] days I think that is the sentiment and
[02:11] the positioning that is starting to show
[02:13] up but I bring it up because it's
[02:14] important uh in tray we just did a lot
[02:16] of back and forth this this week all
[02:18] between 5600 and 5700 that's the 5 days
[02:21] so the S&P really did nothing it just
[02:23] went sideways this is the long-term
[02:25] chart I only bring it up again this is
[02:27] the oneyear moving average effectively
[02:29] the um the 250 day it's an exponential
[02:31] moving average we're hanging around it
[02:34] uh you know if if we were going to sell
[02:36] off again I think the range should be
[02:38] thought of as a ultimate bottom of
[02:41] somewhere in the 4750 to 5000 area
[02:44] you've got some minor support here you
[02:46] probably have some more support over
[02:48] here regardless this is the first level
[02:51] and I think that's why people should be
[02:52] doing their homework uh right now and
[02:55] the other reason is because on the
[02:56] weekly macd one thing that has shown the
[02:58] speed of this move
[03:00] has been unprecedented except for Co so
[03:04] this is taking the the the difference
[03:06] between the uh the the moving average
[03:10] convergence and so 12 versus 26 this is
[03:13] the differential uh you're way way down
[03:17] and the only time we've seen anything
[03:19] this fast was here so again the market
[03:21] has built in a very very sharp slowdown
[03:24] in the economy and earnings and here's
[03:27] where we are here to date the S&P
[03:29] through the last week is up three is
[03:30] down 3.6% so that's it we're not even
[03:33] down 4% more importantly this is the mag
[03:35] 7 here the rest of the market again is
[03:38] up and most importantly with that even
[03:40] seeing oil's down uh on near the lows of
[03:43] the last whatever years energy is the
[03:46] best performing sector I'll get into
[03:47] that later on I've talked about owning
[03:48] energy in your portfolio this year
[03:50] because of uh Ai and I'm going to
[03:53] reemphasize that point as I start to
[03:55] make the transition and start producing
[03:57] research for 22v on this topic uh in
[04:00] terms of the mag 7 you know we're we're
[04:03] down here uh this is the 50 we moving
[04:05] average we're finally starting to see a
[04:08] little bit of normalization but again if
[04:11] you look at the S&P 500 uh this is the
[04:14] equal weight S&P it's down 1.1% through
[04:17] Friday here's the mag 7 down 14 and here
[04:20] is the S&P X the mag 7 which is
[04:23] basically unchanged uh you know
[04:25] depending on which measure you use it's
[04:27] it's somewhere around unchanged for the
[04:29] year
[04:30] and the breath here's the cumulative
[04:31] breath this does not look like some kind
[04:33] of an economic collapse here's what
[04:35] happened during covid this is what
[04:37] happened during Trump the first time
[04:38] we're just sitting up here still we're
[04:40] near the all-time highs on breath which
[04:41] means we're not seeing any kind of
[04:43] problems and last week we actually had
[04:45] breath thrust so just to give you an
[04:46] idea this is the number of names in the
[04:49] S&P
[04:50] 500 which are up uh in this is each day
[04:54] the last time we had backtack days like
[04:56] we did last week of 400 plus you have to
[04:59] go all the way back here which were the
[05:01] lows in early October of 22 most
[05:05] importantly look we haven't had oneus
[05:07] 400 day yet this year we had some in
[05:09] December but we haven't had any uh at
[05:12] all and here's where you ended up the
[05:14] last two weeks so uh strong movement
[05:17] from the breath perspective taking this
[05:20] Jason Gord put this out and said second
[05:21] straight day 90% advancing stocks after
[05:23] hitting 6mon low what happens um I think
[05:27] this column is probably the most
[05:28] important two months later later every
[05:30] time that that's happened going back to
[05:32] the 1930s uh you were up the average was
[05:37] 6.2% uh so just in terms of like
[05:39] thinking about when you've had a big low
[05:42] and then you have a couple strong breath
[05:43] days and where you haven't had bad days
[05:46] it's good but when you combine it with
[05:47] sentiment which that thing did not
[05:49] here's where we are in terms of the
[05:50] bearish we posted our third week of near
[05:53] 60 uh and this was the this was that
[05:56] time in O in 22 when we made the lows in
[06:00] terms of the thrusts uh momentum which
[06:02] led us on the way down despite the mag 7
[06:05] not really bouncing momentum is back
[06:07] through the 20-day and again you've had
[06:09] a lot of there it actually led the S&P
[06:12] uh both on the way down but also on the
[06:14] way back up so it peaked before the S&P
[06:16] did and as of right now it bought them
[06:18] before the S&P did as well so
[06:21] momentum has led uh you can see it
[06:23] before the S&P this is the S&P you can
[06:25] see it's outperforming so momentum is uh
[06:28] is doing much better
[06:30] than had been uh and it's showing signs
[06:34] uh and the good thing is the
[06:36] economically sensitive stuff the one
[06:38] thing that's certain is that GDP is
[06:40] going to be lower the government wants
[06:41] it to be lower so you should have had a
[06:44] movement in the this is the equal weight
[06:46] consumer discretionary versus Consumer
[06:48] Staples which is the white line I don't
[06:50] want to see this bounce back up at this
[06:52] point I'd like to see this kind of hang
[06:53] around down here this is an orchestrated
[06:55] slowdown if we start seeing this go back
[06:57] up and people jumping back into the same
[06:59] theme around growth that would make me
[07:01] suggest that we're going to go down
[07:03] instead they're rotating into things
[07:04] less sensitive so the S&P is still
[07:07] outperforming here and the reason it's
[07:08] outperforming is because again people
[07:09] are rotating into things like energy uh
[07:12] they're moving into AI trades that are
[07:13] different than the AI trades before uh
[07:16] and I'll get into that in terms of the
[07:18] concentration this is msci World X the
[07:20] US again this is I want you to look at
[07:23] this period we barely did anything we
[07:26] finally broke out in 22 when the S&P was
[07:28] going down so was the rest of the world
[07:30] in Co the rest of the world's going down
[07:32] this matters um the rest of the world is
[07:35] doing fine and that means this is a
[07:36] rotation and here it is the related uh
[07:39] trades you can see this one this one
[07:42] this one and now here we have msci World
[07:44] X the us sitting up here while the S&P
[07:46] came down this is a rotation trade guys
[07:49] um it's going to have to get much worse
[07:51] and here is copper versus US growth so
[07:54] you've got Global growth which would be
[07:56] shown through copper uh I've heard all
[07:59] kinds of excuses for why copper is going
[08:01] higher the all um copper is
[08:03] going higher because of a supply demand
[08:04] situation most of it's around AI which
[08:07] I'll go through and it's starting to
[08:08] become something bigger because China's
[08:10] spending money Europe is building out
[08:11] the fence you don't have to look any
[08:13] further than know that Germany and China
[08:16] matter a lot towards the metal side
[08:17] based on what decision- making they're
[08:19] doing and you combine that with the AI
[08:21] data center growth and you have a copper
[08:23] trade here so again we're doing things
[08:25] that make sense the market is repricing
[08:27] things and credit remains completely
[08:29] stable we're not even close to where we
[08:31] were in July in terms of credit spreads
[08:33] this is July of last year um uh here's
[08:36] the one that matters we're still sitting
[08:38] here so until we see a change in credit
[08:41] uh you know there's nothing going on
[08:42] sentiment has worsened so the BFA fund
[08:44] manager survey came out showed the
[08:46] biggest drop in exposure to us equities
[08:49] uh also had a big drop in global
[08:51] economic uh growth uh survey expect
[08:55] Global econ to deteriorate so you know
[08:58] people are getting more bear here's the
[09:00] dramatic shift that we've seen so at the
[09:02] beginning of the year it was us
[09:03] exceptionalism now you've seen a massive
[09:05] rotation outside uh I think at this
[09:07] point you've had such a big positioning
[09:10] change that people should be paying
[09:11] attention here's an important one um
[09:14] Goldman CTA are net short for the first
[09:16] time since 2023 more importantly over
[09:19] the next one week if it's flat there's
[09:22] going to be buyers of 14 billion it up
[09:24] tape 19 down Tape 3 billion so I I again
[09:29] as you go through this and you start
[09:31] looking the month numbers if the
[09:33] Market's going higher there's just a lot
[09:34] of money so a lot of the supply that
[09:36] came uh within the market actually came
[09:39] from ctas again and now they're on the
[09:40] other position and this is the number uh
[09:43] put out just showing Goldman expects 45
[09:47] billion buying on a one month rally uh
[09:49] you can see just the returns that have
[09:52] gone on depending on where you've been
[09:53] so this has a high high predictability
[09:56] looking back um II investor intelligence
[09:59] i' given you this before uh remains
[10:02] depressed second week in a row it's been
[10:04] below 30% and you can go back and look
[10:06] over time as to where this where these
[10:07] have been and what the lows were like in
[10:09] terms of the market uh this is a the aii
[10:13] bear because I mentioned we were close
[10:14] to 60 again 3-we average uh above 58 and
[10:19] then you can go look at those points
[10:21] there all of these were great buying
[10:23] places uh so when sentiment is this
[10:25] negative and there's been this much
[10:27] selling because we've had the big shift
[10:29] now all of a sudden everyone doesn't
[10:31] think so if I were worried I'd be
[10:32] worried that now the us is going to
[10:33] actually outperform uh Europe at this
[10:36] point so you'll have to see where the
[10:38] positioning is we did see enough uh
[10:41] sentiment change also that people were
[10:43] not jumping into the the bond markets so
[10:45] we started to see some deals canceled
[10:47] earlier in the week which again I'm
[10:49] using this more as a sentiment situation
[10:52] uh because we don't have anything
[10:53] happening on the spreads and they didn't
[10:54] want to bring this out just means that
[10:56] right now investors are not buying
[10:58] things for for the long term they're
[11:01] trading they're not getting involved uh
[11:04] this gets back into the point that I
[11:05] brought up that to actually finish the
[11:07] year okay down
[11:09] 10% uh if you go back at all of the
[11:11] times that that's happened so only 12 of
[11:14] the past 97 years that stocks lose 10%
[11:16] or more for the Year this is important
[11:17] because we're already down four so this
[11:20] is saying that to actually be down this
[11:22] much it was in a depression as in World
[11:23] War II basically every single time
[11:26] effectively except for this cuz this was
[11:28] a re session we did lose millions of
[11:30] jobs but in this particular case we
[11:33] didn't lose jobs we did have 2 months of
[11:35] negative GDP um and more importantly we
[11:38] did have earnings decline which is what
[11:40] made that that period unique so uh I
[11:43] think that's the problem is if you're
[11:44] going to have earnings grown you're not
[11:45] going to have a recession highly
[11:47] unlikely you're going to finish down
[11:48] percent for the year which means you
[11:49] should have your playbook out and figure
[11:51] out what you want to buy uh 4 6 9 10
[11:54] months from now because we're not going
[11:56] into a recession in my opinion um now
[11:58] you also have investors say a
[12:00] recessionary trade war is the biggest
[12:01] tail risk the highest tail risk and
[12:03] again the key thing here is trade war
[12:06] and I'll get into that as we kind of go
[12:08] through this uh it's been a quiet week
[12:10] for the quote unquote trade war and I've
[12:13] said before I said it on pomp uh I'll
[12:15] say it again I think the
[12:17] administration's approach was very trade
[12:19] warish as opposed to negotiating tariffs
[12:22] I think this tip for Tat announcing
[12:24] things between Canada between Europe
[12:26] between Mexico if you go through the
[12:27] whole thing it was a public just you
[12:31] know threatening everyone uh from both
[12:34] sides Canada to US US to Canada Europe
[12:37] everything and so things seem to have
[12:39] simmered down and I think that's
[12:40] important and they referenced the point
[12:43] that uh Jameson Greer is was concerned
[12:47] about the environment and got involved
[12:50] and maybe that's had an impact I think
[12:52] also the fact that the some of the
[12:53] Republicans in this case Rand Paul
[12:55] talking about tariff Wars and again it
[12:57] doesn't say trade Wars tar Force hurt
[13:00] home builders I think those these are
[13:01] important important nuances which again
[13:04] uh Pomp and I talked about this week
[13:07] this didn't get a lot of press uh but
[13:10] this came on a day when the market did
[13:11] rally
[13:13] um just talking about the fact that
[13:17] negotiating with other countries about
[13:19] mutually lowering tariffs I think you're
[13:20] going to see some of this going on and I
[13:22] think that's what you have to think
[13:23] about is this a trade War are these
[13:26] renegotiations of tariffs and is uh
[13:29] tariff reciprocity something that is a
[13:32] fair trading thing are there ways to get
[13:34] through it the answer is absolutely so
[13:35] on Friday when the market was at the
[13:37] lows um Trump said there will be
[13:39] flexibility on tariffs about two weeks
[13:42] ago he said there will be very little
[13:46] flexibility on tariffs if you go back
[13:48] and and and look or just go into Twitter
[13:50] and go see it so um the FED got involved
[13:54] this week for the uncertainty and
[13:55] basically brought back the word
[13:57] transitory which again is important
[13:59] because for people like worried about
[14:01] tariffs and inflation and what
[14:03] inflations are going to happen because
[14:04] of tariffs it's just not true um you ra
[14:08] it's a tax hike and if you raise raise
[14:10] it you're going to have less demand in
[14:11] it and they'll gradually kind of stay
[14:12] where they are or they'll come down yes
[14:14] they'll be in immediate raising of
[14:16] prices uh that'll get passed through to
[14:18] Consumers it's more of a consumption tax
[14:20] meaning the people unfortunately who are
[14:22] spending most of the money or the ones
[14:23] who feel the biggest pain uh it it
[14:25] doesn't really matter at the end of the
[14:27] day you're going to have a one-year
[14:28] increase inflation based on the Tariff
[14:30] changes there will be tariffs the one
[14:32] thing I will say there is absolutely no
[14:34] doubt that the Tariff rate in the
[14:36] country will go up um you know where it
[14:38] ends up and where it goes uh again it's
[14:41] another thing I talked about on on this
[14:42] week's video with pomp in terms of just
[14:44] the numbers behind it uh this is where
[14:46] the FED changed they're in their Dot
[14:48] Plot down to 1.7% GDP uh from 2.5 to 2.8
[14:54] uh again I've mentioned before the fears
[14:55] of stagflation just so people know this
[14:57] is not stagflation all right this is
[15:00] this is growth at 1.7% and inflation at
[15:03] 2.8 true stagflation in the 1970s you're
[15:06] having negative GDP and even in n in in
[15:09] 2022 I would say that that was a
[15:11] scenario that they didn't call um stag
[15:14] flation because we had nominal GDP but
[15:16] the reality is we're moving the
[15:17] inflation up slightly we're moving
[15:19] growth down slightly and that's one of
[15:22] the topics that we talked about in here
[15:24] but I think the reason this week's video
[15:25] is important we got into a lot of
[15:27] discussion not just on on the Fed side
[15:29] but also on this concept of recession
[15:32] and I think it's really important for
[15:33] you guys to get as many details as you
[15:35] can you can watch that one uh you can go
[15:37] listen to the Scott bessin all-in
[15:39] podcast he openly talked about what
[15:41] Gavin baker said here the explicitly
[15:44] stated goal is to bring down the deficit
[15:45] without causing a recession I can't say
[15:47] this loud enough to everyone who's
[15:50] reading mainstream media the goal is not
[15:54] to create a recession the administration
[15:56] cannot afford a recession if you go back
[15:58] and look at what happen when we have
[15:59] recessions we have to increase spending
[16:01] to get out of the recession this is not
[16:03] going to happen they have to thread the
[16:05] needle as I said um based on Ray doio
[16:08] you cannot have a recession you have to
[16:12] focus on growth and so at the end of the
[16:15] video this is like literally the last
[16:17] one minute I thought this was a good
[16:19] anecdotal thing uh bessent was
[16:21] describing the way Trump listens and how
[16:23] he makes decisions and I thought this
[16:24] was an interesting kind of way to read
[16:27] through things I uh he's tough but when
[16:30] I went in and I showed him we were
[16:31] talking about something the other day
[16:32] and I said well you know this is going
[16:34] to cause some layoffs he said well let's
[16:36] try to fix it this is not an
[16:38] Administration that's looking for job
[16:40] losses which is what a recession is so
[16:42] you have to remember this and if you
[16:43] want more proof of it Muhammad L Aran
[16:45] was on forward guidance this
[16:47] week um at a at a at an event and he
[16:52] talked about why growth is the only
[16:53] solution you cannot have when you have
[16:56] this much debt you cannot have a a
[16:59] scenario with recession we have a fiscal
[17:02] deficit of 6 and a half% if you go into
[17:04] a recession you're going to have to
[17:05] increase spending they don't want to do
[17:07] that they're trying to cut spending so
[17:08] they have to find a way to cut it very
[17:10] little and Scott Besson said over the
[17:12] next four years we want to get the
[17:13] deficit down to 3% from 6 and a half s
[17:16] so this is the reality of the situation
[17:19] reading the paper about he wants to
[17:20] cause a recession or this is in there
[17:22] you're you're you're falling into the
[17:23] Trap and you're going to miss any kind
[17:25] of ability to buy things uh during the
[17:27] panic
[17:29] uh economic alarm Bells Are Ringing
[17:31] everywhere uh here's the thing I want to
[17:34] uh highlight first the good news there
[17:37] is no solid evidence right now that the
[17:39] economy is in a recession or even
[17:40] particularly close to it the bad news is
[17:43] that warning bells are that it's ringing
[17:45] Every Which Way that's because the Soft
[17:47] Data all of the Soft Data has turned
[17:49] negative the Soft Data meaning surveys
[17:51] so the University of Michigan which I
[17:53] highlighted last week has a bias to it
[17:55] in terms of the politics um the is the
[17:58] PMI Sur survey just had big drop most of
[18:00] the PMI surveys and they've said we
[18:02] don't know what the policy is going to
[18:03] be so right now we're uncertain and so
[18:05] we're holding back spending as much uh
[18:08] there's no doubt that that's going on
[18:09] that's why GDP falling to one and change
[18:12] percent in the first quarter makes
[18:13] complete sense to me and even the second
[18:14] quarter I don't have a problem with it
[18:16] and I think that's the case that's a
[18:17] long way off from going into recession
[18:19] and that's what Brian Mahan said this
[18:21] week growth is better than people expect
[18:23] and have put in six uh consumers have
[18:28] put 6% more into the economy
[18:30] year-over-year uh Bank of America has
[18:33] data real time from credit cards now
[18:35] they also put out that they're expecting
[18:37] a drop
[18:38] from a 2.5 forecast for q1 to 1 and a
[18:42] half 2.3 down to one and a half they've
[18:43] moved the entire year I think this is
[18:45] very legitimate based on the new
[18:47] austerity policies of trying to get the
[18:49] deficit down but again if you're going
[18:51] to have a recession all you need to look
[18:53] at are the weekly jobless claim numbers
[18:55] until this white line which is still
[18:57] sitting at historic close relative to
[18:59] population but also does not budge we
[19:02] are at 227 which is basically where
[19:03] we've been the entire time since 2021
[19:06] there has been no change think about how
[19:07] many recession fears we had during this
[19:09] time period here's the unemployment rate
[19:11] which is not as uh the gauge here and
[19:13] historically the white line leads or at
[19:16] least is going up at the exact same time
[19:17] that's not happening right now until we
[19:19] start seeing claims actually going
[19:21] higher this is not the situation so I
[19:24] wrote a substack just on how historic in
[19:26] my opinion the sentiment is without
[19:28] their being a crisis I go all the way
[19:30] back to the 1930s to
[19:32] highlight why the Great Depression was
[19:34] called a psychological term the
[19:36] depression and how sentiment without
[19:38] crisis uh will lead to opportunities for
[19:41] people who fall into it but just to show
[19:42] how bad it is um this is from Apollo
[19:46] record high of consumers think business
[19:48] conditions are weakening so you're
[19:50] you're at levels above where we were
[19:52] during the great financial crisis above
[19:55] where they were during Co I mean these
[19:57] are these are unprecedent Ed situations
[19:59] 12-month economic expectations more
[20:02] unemployment people are expecting more
[20:04] unemployment I mean you're up at levels
[20:06] that are consistent with a recession and
[20:08] again those appropriate periods are in
[20:10] here this is the unemployment rate so
[20:12] each time that that we had recessions
[20:14] you had the unemployment rate going up
[20:16] violently that is not the case and
[20:18] what's happening we're still sitting
[20:20] near the all-time lows and yes we've
[20:21] moved a little bit higher but we peaked
[20:23] a while ago when everyone panicked about
[20:25] the last recession with the S Rule and
[20:27] now we're just sitting there that being
[20:28] said as I've said I think AI is going to
[20:30] continue to put pressure on the jobs
[20:32] Market we have had a weakening jobs
[20:34] Market overall uh or at least a
[20:36] softening jobs Market that's going to
[20:38] continue because of AI and also the
[20:40] demographic side will keep it from
[20:41] getting too bad but um Goldman sacks put
[20:45] this out and I think people should pay
[20:46] attention this is where we are right now
[20:47] and their forecast is that for
[20:49] government Healthcare and education
[20:51] you're going to see a Slowdown
[20:52] significantly here and I happen to agree
[20:54] with that I think we're going to keep
[20:56] moving in that direction sorry for the
[20:58] beeping in the background um we are
[21:00] going to have this uh move down over
[21:02] there uh it's going to take some time so
[21:05] just you know except the fact that the
[21:08] job market is uh we're going to head
[21:09] down towards I would say and I've said
[21:12] this repeatedly on this on this video 50
[21:15] to 100,000 best case scenarios so let's
[21:17] take 35 to 85,000 jobs I think is about
[21:20] where we're going to be because of AI
[21:22] and because of what the government is
[21:23] doing at least for the near- term I
[21:24] wanted to just highlight this because
[21:26] I've talked about a bunch of these
[21:27] separately but I wanted to put them on
[21:28] the red line here is the unemployment
[21:30] rate the yellow line here is the temp
[21:33] Ser the temp jobs that are created so we
[21:35] haven't been creating temp jobs these
[21:36] are actually payroll jobs the white line
[21:38] here is the hours worked continuing to
[21:40] go down this is the New York fed survey
[21:44] on the uh perception people have about
[21:46] the ability to get a job with inside
[21:48] three months after they lose their job
[21:50] and the green line is the jolt hiring
[21:52] thing all of them have turned down this
[21:54] is the long-term chart normally when
[21:56] these are breaking down so the
[21:57] unemployment rate is going up that's not
[21:59] happening this time and that's because
[22:01] as I've mentioned AI is having an impact
[22:03] on the way people think about things but
[22:05] also they're worried about their jobs
[22:07] because their companies aren't doing
[22:08] well and that's another AI thing it's
[22:09] another high rate thing it's why the
[22:10] government is trying to get rates down
[22:12] one place that has decided they have to
[22:15] go all in um Michael Pettis has been in
[22:17] China for a long long time um he was
[22:20] involved in Emerging Markets down the
[22:21] 90s he's one of the smarter people on
[22:23] China he's lived there for a long time
[22:25] China's newly announced consumption
[22:27] action plan is the most comprehensive
[22:28] package of policies for boosting
[22:29] consumer spending that the country has
[22:31] released in over four decades people
[22:33] have been fading China fading China
[22:35] fading China they've made a mistake
[22:37] they've been wrong wrong wrong they will
[22:39] continue to be wrong wrong wrong China
[22:41] continues to be focused on having an
[22:44] economy which is going to grow 5% but
[22:46] they have to get consumer spending to go
[22:49] and this is a new new chance and again
[22:51] real estate stability for the first time
[22:53] so they are
[22:55] focused on parts of the economy that
[22:57] matter a lot to the global economy in
[22:59] terms of real estate Commodities things
[23:00] like that that's why I brought up the
[23:02] copper thing um if you go through and
[23:04] just read uh Chinese Bank slashing rates
[23:06] on Consumer loans to record lows policy
[23:08] makers ramp up stimulus to stabilize
[23:09] growth and counter us Donald Trump's
[23:12] tariffs this is why this stuff is going
[23:14] on and this is why it's important um
[23:17] China dollar Bond deals surge as the
[23:19] market Gloom begins to lift remember
[23:20] China's had a uh fear on the debt
[23:23] problem for a long time and now you've
[23:26] got all these changes and I wanted to
[23:28] bring this up because copper has been
[23:29] hanging up here despite the fact that
[23:32] year-over-year real estate fixed asset
[23:34] investment so any building on
[23:36] construction has been sitting down here
[23:38] we've already had prices normalized and
[23:40] start to move higher we haven't seen the
[23:42] um any kind of change in terms of
[23:44] building stuff not sure we're going to
[23:46] see it but even if it goes from minus 10
[23:48] to zero that's going to be a big deal
[23:50] copper is going up without it so I think
[23:52] this is just something again where China
[23:54] was a drag on copper the last two years
[23:56] I know a lot of people have been trying
[23:58] to play materials on the back of the AI
[24:01] side that's what I'm going to get into
[24:02] now uh as the bigger thing here's
[24:04] natural gases natural gas this is the
[24:06] 10th contract this is as parabolic as
[24:08] you get just think about the fact that
[24:10] it's moving at a faster pace and even
[24:12] during covid when we had Supply
[24:14] disruptions that were massive and
[24:15] shutdowns and people not working this
[24:17] has still gone higher so I I I just
[24:21] think people are missing the power trade
[24:22] here uh Citadel announced that they're
[24:25] expanding further into US natural gas
[24:27] with $1 billion deal uh this is going to
[24:31] be my first research report for 22v uh I
[24:34] spent a lot of time on this but this is
[24:37] uh my belief that the most important
[24:39] transition in the new regime we're going
[24:40] through is going from the cloud of llm
[24:43] so the last 15 years everything is about
[24:45] going from Hardware to software it's all
[24:47] about the cloud it's all about getting
[24:49] off of servers well now we're getting to
[24:51] embodied AI so far it's been AI in the
[24:54] cloud now we're getting to a embodied AI
[24:57] which means the next Hardware investment
[24:59] uh Frontier is coming what I do and what
[25:01] I go through not only companies that
[25:03] will benefit from this but also AI
[25:06] embodiment has to do with obviously data
[25:08] centers is one of the most important you
[25:10] can't power this whole thing without the
[25:12] data centers so the data centers are the
[25:14] first Hardware buildout but you also
[25:16] have the physical devices you're going
[25:17] to have computers that are AI native
[25:20] phones that are AI native that's
[25:21] starting this year the Enterprise AI
[25:23] agents this is an important part of just
[25:26] understanding that if you're going to
[25:27] use AI agents it's it takes a lot more
[25:29] power that needs more data centers but
[25:31] it also takes more memory there's a
[25:32] whole bunch of things which come into
[25:33] inference being used um this is the
[25:36] computers and the uh uh and the phones
[25:40] you've got humanoid robots I'm going to
[25:41] go through a bunch of that but you also
[25:42] have autonomous vehicles which take a
[25:44] lot more Hardware different components
[25:46] the electrification of the world in
[25:49] terms of putting AI in and the reason
[25:51] this is important I wanted to just show
[25:52] you so the white line here is Chevron
[25:55] relative to the S&P if I were to bring
[25:57] up what this chart matches up with this
[25:59] pretty much matches up
[26:02] with what has happened with the mag 7
[26:05] what happened when the iPhone came out
[26:07] when regime shift you're moving from a
[26:09] point where we got off of Hardware where
[26:11] China slowed down I just showed you that
[26:13] China is doing something they haven't
[26:14] done in four decades this is natural gas
[26:17] underneath so this is Chevron relative
[26:19] to the S&P you can see there's going
[26:21] Chevron here relative to the S&P very
[26:24] important so what does Chevron fit in
[26:25] it's an oil company no it's not it's an
[26:27] AI company um these are recent quotes
[26:30] and commentary from Chevron weing how
[26:32] they are be benefiting from AI uh this
[26:35] is power to scale we haven't seen AI
[26:37] companies going faster so this is on the
[26:38] build out of the data centers this is on
[26:41] how they're using it and what's going on
[26:43] so they're also using it to make better
[26:47] decisions to go through the way you
[26:49] would use it and benefiting from the
[26:52] data center buildout I I'm just bringing
[26:54] this up because this is the adoption
[26:55] phase this is where the benefits are
[26:57] going to come Chevron to develop and
[26:59] power data centers in the US so they're
[27:01] fixated on that you just can't get away
[27:03] from it and as I mentioned Jensen yuang
[27:05] spoke this week 2hour um keynote speech
[27:09] every single data center in the future
[27:10] will be power limited we are now a power
[27:13] limited industry power is what's needed
[27:16] it's always been the relationship
[27:18] between Innovation at some point
[27:19] Innovation goes too fast and we run out
[27:21] of power that's where we are right now
[27:22] and anyone who's fading the power
[27:24] buildout the data center buildout uh if
[27:26] you haven't accepted that you were wrong
[27:28] after deep seek you will be accepting it
[27:30] as this this doesn't mean that Nvidia
[27:32] should be trading at 100 PE or 50 PE but
[27:35] now you've taken it down to a level
[27:36] where as long as their earnings and
[27:37] their revenues are growing where they
[27:38] had been I would expect trading off of
[27:41] the earnings now we've reset the
[27:43] multiple and now we'll trade off this
[27:45] that gets important because I think
[27:46] we've already done enough of the damage
[27:47] on the uh at least when it comes to
[27:49] Nvidia probably Tesla as well as I get
[27:51] through the robotic side but this is
[27:53] what Jensen yag said and you have to
[27:54] listen to it and go through it this is
[27:56] not like some random person saying AI
[27:58] Computing needs to Surge 100 fold this
[28:02] is all post deep seek this is what I've
[28:04] said I know I use more than 100 times as
[28:06] much power than I did before uh in terms
[28:09] of uh going through inference and
[28:12] research papers I use much more powerful
[28:15] Ai and there's no way they're making
[28:17] money off me because I do it multiple
[28:19] times a day I'm using it for coding
[28:21] everyone that's doing this and everyone
[28:23] that's going through it is just using
[28:25] more power and all the code in the world
[28:27] that was written over the course of the
[28:29] last 15 years will now be done by
[28:32] computers it will now be done with power
[28:34] it won't be with a human being sitting
[28:35] behind it going through it so we went
[28:37] from a world where the most important
[28:39] commodity was coding we didn't use
[28:42] copper we didn't use any of this stuff
[28:43] because we were putting it in the cloud
[28:44] well now we're getting back to needing
[28:46] it to be in something a physical thing
[28:49] whether it's a car whether it's a
[28:51] computer whether everything is going to
[28:52] take more memory so you're just going to
[28:54] have to spend the time on this this is
[28:55] why I'm saying it's why I decided not to
[28:57] go back to hedge fund cuz I don't think
[28:59] people can adjust to this quickly and I
[29:00] don't think they can be on top of it
[29:01] this is a major Trend uh data center is
[29:04] charging toward 1 trillion AI boom I
[29:07] bring this up because he said trillion
[29:09] dollar spend by 2028 and I'm not saying
[29:12] a trillion dollar is cumulative he's
[29:14] saying a trillion dollars will be spent
[29:15] in 2028 we're talking about capex
[29:18] numbers for this year of 300 billion
[29:20] from the mag 7 all Global about 500
[29:22] billion he's saying that number is going
[29:24] to go up to a trillion dollars there's
[29:26] nothing that's going to stop in this so
[29:28] for anyone to believe that somehow Or
[29:29] Another We're going to come up with a
[29:30] solution to be able to deal with this
[29:32] based on what deep seek did they're just
[29:34] not paying attention to the big picture
[29:36] so uh I I think Nvidia and all these
[29:38] companies particularly in the semis
[29:40] that's the place you want to look for
[29:41] the benefit um Matt seagull was uh put
[29:44] this thing out from the data center
[29:45] World Expo not cooling down so there was
[29:48] a conference UBS put this out I'm not
[29:50] going to go read all this stuff to you
[29:51] but basically everything is showing that
[29:54] nothing is slowed down so if you don't
[29:56] believe Jensen just believe the data
[29:58] center the reason we're going to see
[29:59] this kind of growth or one of the
[30:01] reasons and this is what I spent a lot
[30:02] of time in the embodiment of AI is the
[30:04] robots the next multi- trillion dollar
[30:06] industry we are at the very beginning
[30:09] not even close to the first inning of
[30:11] the robotic side but you are creating
[30:13] robots now I've highlighted these Jensen
[30:16] made sure he said it's coming much
[30:18] faster than you believe uh human roid
[30:20] robot Revolution is closer and you think
[30:22] if you haven't watched all the videos if
[30:23] you haven't spent time on it you really
[30:25] should go do it because it's coming and
[30:26] it's coming fast um I highlight all
[30:29] these if I were you guys I'd be adding
[30:30] all these to a Twitter list of humanoids
[30:32] so you can see the stuff there's 15 20
[30:35] of them uh each day from these places
[30:38] that I'm going through in terms of
[30:40] looking I'm just continuing to go
[30:41] through what Jensen highlighted he
[30:43] showed a robot uh Alon mus did an
[30:45] interview on uh with um I forget who he
[30:49] did it with this week uh yeah doesn't
[30:53] really matter uh but he did an interview
[30:55] this week where he went through there
[30:56] will be a massive number of robots and
[30:58] 10 years you'll be able to snap on parts
[30:59] and Optimist change it look 20% chance
[31:02] blah uh whoever controls the AI chips
[31:04] wins the AI U race he also had a meeting
[31:08] or a a an event at his at the firm for
[31:12] the employees and basically said uh
[31:14] it'll be the biggest product of all time
[31:16] nothing will even be close it'll be even
[31:18] 10 times bigger than the next the
[31:20] biggest product ever
[31:21] made he said they'll produce 5,000 optim
[31:24] Optimus this year and 50,000 in 2026
[31:29] this is why robotics needs to be on the
[31:31] focus these are humanoids these are not
[31:33] the robotics that you're thinking of
[31:35] this is humanoids so you have to go
[31:37] watch the videos to see what they can do
[31:38] and just realize that the time has come
[31:40] for robots um this guy puts out a lot of
[31:44] things on AI agents but if you want to
[31:45] go see 50 demos I just made it easy for
[31:47] you to go through it you really have to
[31:49] pay attention on the hardware and think
[31:51] about it um anyone who doubts that AI
[31:53] continues to accelerate this is just the
[31:55] length of Tas AI do is doubling every
[31:57] 7even months so it's going a hell of a
[31:58] lot faster than Mo's law and that's
[32:01] going to continue to grow so you have
[32:02] the exponential side and the reason I
[32:04] bring that up is if you're focused on
[32:06] tariffs which are a temporary thing and
[32:07] you're not paying attention to what's
[32:09] going on and you don't realize that
[32:10] Chevron is up on the year that Intel's
[32:12] up on the year that Cisco is up on the
[32:14] year that Micron is up on the year that
[32:16] all of these old companies that were
[32:19] benefiting from hardware and commodities
[32:21] are doing very well and I showed you the
[32:23] energy sector is up you are missing that
[32:25] the market is rot trting away from the
[32:27] mag 7 which with the software boom and
[32:28] they're moving into the AI boom which is
[32:30] now the hardware boom that's what's
[32:32] happening Bitcoin I've said is the
[32:34] purest AI trade once it can separate
[32:36] itself from the mag 7 um technically you
[32:39] broke out this week and then Donald
[32:41] Trump had some announcement and as is
[32:42] usually the case uh whenever he speaks
[32:45] about crypto it sells off almost
[32:46] immediately I think we need to get rid
[32:49] we need to be prepared for that every
[32:50] single time because unless he says he
[32:52] just bought something which he's not
[32:54] going to uh the market sells off every
[32:56] single time but it's still hanging
[32:57] around the the 200 day moving average
[32:58] but most importantly if you're down on
[33:00] it I've talked about this being the most
[33:02] important Trend we came out of the last
[33:05] correction uh in July August with
[33:08] Bitcoin outperforming the mag 7 and then
[33:10] we got into the election and now we've
[33:12] gone sideways I've said and if I took
[33:14] this back further Bitcoin has unchanged
[33:16] versus the mag 7 since 2018 which means
[33:20] it's been equally as good to own the mag
[33:22] 7 this is the point where Bitcoin
[33:24] becomes the second biggest asset in the
[33:26] world as during this rally so this is
[33:28] the one that you want to watch this is
[33:29] when he spoke that's when the market
[33:31] sold off um don't forget the stablecoin
[33:34] ACT is going through so I just want you
[33:35] to go I want to finish up this week with
[33:37] just reminding you um we're getting
[33:40] caught in tariffs they're trying to fix
[33:42] the deficit side because the deficit is
[33:44] Big this whole thing if you didn't read
[33:46] this just go bring it up in chat GPT Lyn
[33:49] Alden is fantastic um Sam Sam
[33:52] gallahan same thing uh follow both of
[33:54] them on Twitter uh X and just go read
[33:58] fiscal dominance because as you go
[33:59] through this and this is one of the
[34:01] things that they bring up in there the
[34:03] debts not going anywhere so we're
[34:05] focused on the deficit because if the
[34:07] deficit doesn't get back in check that
[34:09] means the the debts are growing even
[34:11] faster we got to assume that we're still
[34:13] going to have we still have a
[34:14] demographic problem we still have an
[34:15] entitlement problem we still have
[34:16] Germany now spending money we have China
[34:18] spending money you're you're going to
[34:19] end up in a situation where you you
[34:21] forget what Bitcoin is about Bitcoin is
[34:23] about debts just continuing to increase
[34:26] and then every time you go into a
[34:27] recession you get a faster one and the
[34:29] reason that's important I hear everyone
[34:30] talking about gold and they're coming
[34:31] with all these major reasons the reality
[34:33] is here is gold relative to 5-year jgb
[34:37] yields we are at a position where I
[34:39] don't care what goes on right now it is
[34:41] really hard with rates sitting up here
[34:43] and Donald Trump changing the world
[34:45] order that gold and Bitcoin uh both fall
[34:49] into the situation of you need to own
[34:51] things outside of the Fiat system that's
[34:54] the main point yes Bitcoin may not be
[34:56] going up right now with but the same
[34:58] thing happened with gold back when gold
[34:59] was rallying in this period in here and
[35:02] Bitcoin was not and then Bitcoin
[35:04] eventually caught up because it has a
[35:06] higher Beta And it moved faster so just
[35:07] keep that in mind if you want to go read
[35:09] something on the public debt this came
[35:11] out in October the IMF was basically
[35:13] saying the public debt it's not saying
[35:14] the fiscal deficit it's talking about
[35:16] trying to stop the public debt which
[35:19] just can't happen and I'll show you the
[35:20] reason why so you can go through this um
[35:24] you can look at how wrong uh the budget
[35:27] de deficits have been the forecast this
[35:29] is the CBO in terms of uh sorry the debt
[35:31] to GDP forecast so just look at here
[35:35] where it was now some of the forecasts
[35:36] weren't too bad but then once you got to
[35:39] here this is the actual debt to GDP
[35:42] starts to rally and guess what happened
[35:44] here this is a great financial crisis
[35:46] this is also when Bitcoin white paper
[35:49] was written since that point not once
[35:51] can we keep this stuff in check so now
[35:53] we have this huge forecast going in so
[35:56] normally they're wrong which which would
[35:57] make you think it's going to come up
[35:59] here regardless of what you actually
[36:00] believe remember Bitcoin is about
[36:02] getting outside they debase and even
[36:05] though the government right now is
[36:07] trying to do it they're targeting fiscal
[36:08] deficit to get back down and then who's
[36:10] going to be in charge after that and
[36:12] what are they going to view on spending
[36:14] this just continues to go Germany's now
[36:16] in a point where they're
[36:18] spending
[36:20] uh want to take out unprecedented loans
[36:23] for the military and for infrastructure
[36:25] so this doesn't stop and I just want to
[36:27] kind of finish with these last two
[36:28] charts um I've said this before so the
[36:32] white line here or sorry the yellow line
[36:34] here is debt in the US this is the
[36:36] growth since
[36:38] 1994 so this is how much we've seen the
[36:40] debt grow the purple line here is
[36:43] household net worth up dramatically this
[36:46] is GDP and this is corporate profit
[36:48] margins this is a statistic which was
[36:51] created in the 1930s which does not take
[36:53] into account these two things here
[36:56] meaning it does not take into account
[36:58] true productivity true efficiency it
[37:01] doesn't know that an iPhone that cost
[37:02] $500 now that cost $500 8 years ago but
[37:06] has tons more functionality tons more
[37:08] ability to do things tons more apps it
[37:10] doesn't include it in GDP it's not
[37:12] included they do not have know how to
[37:14] deal with software and that's just the
[37:16] reality of situation that's why I'll end
[37:18] it on go read Allen greens B's
[37:20] conversations in 199 or his papers in
[37:22] 1998 he did multiple speeches on how GDP
[37:26] is not a relevant statistic in a world
[37:27] of software they've changed things in
[37:29] there GDP unfortunately cannot measure
[37:32] what's going on but here's the reality
[37:34] we set interest rates off that we react
[37:36] as investors off that you should not be
[37:38] reacting off that you should be focused
[37:40] on the acceleration and Innovation and
[37:43] what it's doing is it's bringing more
[37:44] profit margins more productivity and so
[37:47] by the end of this year the S&P will be
[37:48] at new all-time highs and the reason it
[37:50] will be at new all-time highs is not
[37:52] because of the tariffs it's not because
[37:53] of stimulus it's because of productivity
[37:55] and that's where we're at that's it for
[37:57] me this week and I will uh see you guys
[37:59] next week
