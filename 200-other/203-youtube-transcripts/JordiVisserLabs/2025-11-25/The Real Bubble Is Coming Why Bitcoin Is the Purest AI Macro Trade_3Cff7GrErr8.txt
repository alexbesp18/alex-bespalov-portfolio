--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] There's a lot to go through. You can see
[00:01] it in the uh the list here. Take a look.
[00:04] You guys read it on your own. And I'm
[00:06] just going to start going fast. Uh
[00:11] finished up September. It's the best
[00:13] September in 15 years for S&P. So again,
[00:17] everyone who wanted to sell the Fed news
[00:19] and basically sell coming out of the
[00:21] summertime, uh you don't hear any more
[00:24] of the 10 listed fears of tariffs and
[00:27] inflation and stagflation and Fed making
[00:31] policy mistakes and earnings and
[00:33] recessions and everything else. So we're
[00:34] moving on. Uh and I think now people are
[00:37] focused on the fact of the facts of
[00:38] what's happening. S&P was up 1% last
[00:41] week. Russell was up 1.8. Led again. Uh
[00:45] we've got VA moving down. We've got junk
[00:47] spreads at alltime tights. Uh bond vault
[00:50] keeps coming in. It's affecting mortgage
[00:52] spreads. So you got the housing boost
[00:54] coming from the spreads coming in. I
[00:56] expect, as I've said, for that to
[00:58] continue with the White House. Uh and
[01:00] not just bond V, but you've also got FXV
[01:04] coming down. So everything is getting
[01:06] stabilized, and we still have now a 95%
[01:09] chance of a cut in October.
[01:12] And uh close to 100% for December at
[01:17] this point. Uh Hartnett, who's been
[01:20] calling this a bubble for a while, this
[01:22] is one way to get around saying it's a
[01:24] bubble as a negative headline. Uh market
[01:26] bubbles only burst when central banks
[01:27] tighten and there's no sign of that. So,
[01:30] uh this was in the Block Works Forward
[01:35] guidance weekly podcast uh last week.
[01:40] I've shown you how rate cuts
[01:43] have been a positive when you're not in
[01:44] a recession. This is another way of
[01:46] looking at it. Uh something that's only
[01:49] happened once in 40 years, which is the
[01:52] only time the Fed cut without falling
[01:54] earnings. In this case, it's doubledigit
[01:57] earnings.
[01:58] Uh I give these guys a shout out because
[02:00] this is pretty much the only macro
[02:02] podcast I listen to at this point each
[02:04] week. I listen to AI podcasts. I listen
[02:06] to power podcasts. A whole bunch of
[02:08] different things, but I've pretty much
[02:10] given up on the macro podcast because I
[02:12] don't need to hear what people are
[02:13] saying. And that usually is a sign that
[02:15] people have given up on the bearish
[02:16] side. So, when the sentiment gets up to
[02:18] higher levels, which I think is
[02:19] definitely going to happen over the next
[02:20] four months, uh it'll be worthwhile. But
[02:23] these guys are the ones that I would
[02:25] recommend you guys listen to on a weekly
[02:26] basis. Uh sentiment, don't care what
[02:29] anyone says. This is what I hear from
[02:31] people as well. Uh, and I thought this
[02:33] line was perfect. We're getting plenty
[02:35] of push back from traders as we continue
[02:37] to highlight investor. All I get is push
[02:40] back from people who are still worried
[02:44] about an AI bubble. So for the people
[02:46] who've made money, they're obviously on
[02:48] top of it, but it's still an incredibly
[02:50] high percentage that are negative.
[02:52] Retail, on the other hand, continues to
[02:54] push things. So this is the retail
[02:56] favorite index blowing out again last
[02:58] week. Uh Jared Kubin, another good
[03:00] person to follow in this, does a lot of
[03:03] uh really smart stuff out there,
[03:04] particularly on the factor side. Uh
[03:07] equities, retail continues to be buying
[03:10] uh ETF buyers in 1383 of the 185 days.
[03:15] Uh and so what you're left with is this,
[03:17] and I brought Micron up. I've spent a
[03:18] lot of time talking about Micron this
[03:20] year. It's been a nice position for me.
[03:22] Uh and institutional people have a hard
[03:26] time buying stuff like this. retail
[03:28] doesn't, quant doesn't, but institutions
[03:31] and also analysts that maybe had a sell
[03:34] rating on it here.
[03:36] There's just no way for them to turn at
[03:38] this point. And these charts are
[03:39] everywhere. Uh I had a meeting this week
[03:42] and uh it was a great meeting. Guys are
[03:44] very smart, but they said that they had
[03:46] experts coming in on high bandwidth
[03:48] memory and that there would be an over
[03:51] supply situation next year. And I I
[03:53] could not believe it. Um, it's different
[03:55] than the work that I do and I'm not a
[03:57] bottoms up person. This is just purely
[03:59] from a top- down basis of focusing on AI
[04:01] where all the demand is today and where
[04:03] it'll be a year from now. And I found it
[04:05] unbelievable. But then I started
[04:07] thinking about how this would be a good
[04:08] way to use AI and show you guys how when
[04:10] these analysts come in the door, you can
[04:12] use it for this. I was told this week by
[04:14] experts uh are suggesting high bandwidth
[04:17] memories probably will be larger than
[04:18] demand next year. This is common belief.
[04:22] uh I found credible discussion that some
[04:23] animalists expected blah blah blah. So
[04:25] then you go to the next one. So the
[04:27] question for me regarding the experts,
[04:28] there are so many areas of growth in
[04:30] demand. Doesn't an expert need to
[04:31] understand the breadth of the demand
[04:32] side more than supply? Historically, was
[04:35] HBM driven mainly by a sector or two
[04:37] where demand was fairly linear? This is
[04:40] an incredibly important part of this. We
[04:43] are in exponential demand. There has not
[04:46] been a time that you can go find where
[04:49] you can find exponential demand. That's
[04:51] why the numbers look so big. That's why
[04:53] it feels like a bubble. Why experts risk
[04:55] under uh demand? Linearity bias. This is
[04:58] so important because most demand is
[05:01] related to nominal GDP, the overall
[05:03] spending. So, if you're way above it,
[05:04] like think about the revenues of the MAG
[05:06] 7. They're way above nominal GDP, but
[05:09] only by 1.6 times. They're growing
[05:11] revenue at 10. The S&P 493 is growing
[05:14] revenue closer to four. Nominal GDP is
[05:18] five. So you get a a point here where
[05:21] you got to focus on where it is. But
[05:23] then there's another thing. It creates
[05:25] this beautiful heat map for me on all of
[05:28] the areas of demand for high bandwidth
[05:30] memory. A lot of these like this has
[05:32] never happened before. This has never
[05:34] happened before. We've never needed a
[05:36] defense reboot the way we're going to
[05:38] need this time. So how can any
[05:41] semianalist say with certainty unless
[05:43] they're focusing across verticals what's
[05:46] going on? That is the reason why I do
[05:48] this podcast. That is the reason why you
[05:50] have to understand that these markets
[05:52] are moving in this exponential chart
[05:54] function because Micron was trading at
[05:57] singledigit pees for most of the year uh
[06:01] and is still off future uh future uh
[06:04] numbers. I still think they're off
[06:06] because of the certainty of what is to
[06:08] come. So data centers is one side but
[06:10] when you spread it out it's more. SK
[06:12] Heinex,
[06:13] same boat up. Um, I just put this in
[06:16] here because this was a news item this
[06:18] week and again I'm gonna keep saying it.
[06:19] I think a deal with China and the US if
[06:23] it does occur as I expect at the apex
[06:26] summit where they announce some kind of
[06:28] bargain. Do not underestimate that that
[06:30] could be the trigger point for the true
[06:33] bubble or the true point where everyone
[06:35] is forced into the market because I do
[06:37] view it as a much bigger event than most
[06:39] people and I think people are sleeping
[06:40] on the wheel at the importance uh
[06:43] overall ADP came out can't minimize this
[06:47] last four five months 6 months whatever
[06:49] you want to take this matches up with
[06:51] what's happening across there we also as
[06:54] we go through this so if I go this is
[06:56] not the GDP but I've shown chart parts
[06:58] like this. But this had other new data.
[07:00] So we have new new highs for job for the
[07:04] uh the job differential in terms of the
[07:06] the conference board worsened again. We
[07:08] had the Jolts quits rate came back down
[07:10] here. This is the unemployment rate up
[07:12] here. This is temp hiring here. And then
[07:15] this one here we had earnings from
[07:17] paychecks. We had ADP out. This is the
[07:20] human resource gicks level three sector
[07:23] relative to the S&P breaking also to new
[07:26] lows. There is no hiring going on.
[07:28] Here's the challenger. People look at
[07:30] the stupid number that comes out in
[07:31] Bloomberg. They give you a lot of data.
[07:33] Announced hiring plans for September.
[07:35] This is the retail time period. 117.
[07:39] That's a drop off of 75% from last year.
[07:42] Bigger from the year before. Look at
[07:44] these numbers. 2017 on. We have no
[07:46] hiring plans going on from people. We
[07:49] also had with inside the uh the jolts
[07:52] number we get job openings and then you
[07:54] do a ratio relative to people not uh
[07:57] people looking for work but unemployed.
[07:59] We broke through one. So there's more
[08:01] people looking for work for the first
[08:02] time. That's the white line here. It
[08:04] broke above one. That's the unemployment
[08:06] rate tracking it. So the labor market
[08:08] continues to be on the weaker side. And
[08:12] Walmart came out this week says he can't
[08:14] think of a single job that won't be
[08:16] changed by AI. Walmart is not projecting
[08:18] largecale layoffs or hiring sprees, but
[08:21] rather a period of considerable
[08:22] transition.
[08:25] Uh, AI is going to change literally
[08:26] every job. Maybe there's a job in the
[08:28] world that AI won't change, but I
[08:30] haven't thought of it. Walmart has
[08:32] already deployed AI agents. This is
[08:34] going to become a bigger story, guys.
[08:36] I've talked about it. I'm going to show
[08:37] you a lot of stuff that was released
[08:38] this week. Same thing. Asurers cutting
[08:41] staff is cutting plans to hire
[08:47] What's the difference between those two?
[08:48] One's a fact, one's the one to keep
[08:50] people from going crazy. Advanced AI is
[08:52] becoming a part of everything we do.
[08:54] This is a censure. The reason these uh
[08:56] Oh, and then you have Amazon basically
[08:58] saying the same thing uh back in June.
[09:00] The reason I brought up all three of
[09:01] them, in case you didn't know, here are
[09:03] the top four largest private employers
[09:05] in the United States of America.
[09:07] Walmart, Amazon, Asenture, all of them
[09:09] saying the same thing. Google announced
[09:12] job cuts. They didn't announce them.
[09:14] They kind of slipped it through on
[09:16] September Monday of this past week and
[09:18] they were in the cloud division. Google
[09:21] cloud is currently Alphabet's fastest
[09:22] growing major revenue segment.
[09:26] Uh they've mentioned on their earnings
[09:28] calls that they have significant
[09:30] capacity constraints inside that
[09:32] division.
[09:34] Uh the employees were not happy
[09:38] and professors everybody is struggling
[09:41] to get jobs. This is a leading uh
[09:43] professor out of UC Berkeley.
[09:46] People hate colleges now. They don't
[09:49] believe the college education is worth
[09:51] what it was. We're now down to 35% see
[09:54] it as very important. I could not agree
[09:57] more, especially as we go into AI. Every
[09:59] minute that you were in a classroom,
[10:01] you're wasting time not using artificial
[10:03] intelligence. You are learning how to
[10:05] memorize things which have zero value
[10:07] and have now been completely
[10:09] commoditized. The social side is still
[10:11] worth money, but the time wasted in the
[10:13] classrooms because the education system
[10:17] has not embraced artificial
[10:18] intelligence. Uh even though all the
[10:20] kids are cheating at this point and the
[10:21] schools don't know what to do. All
[10:22] right. The middle age are no longer the
[10:24] most miserable. Youth is miserable. And
[10:27] I think everyone knows that. And in New
[10:28] York City, young voters showed up for
[10:31] Zoran Mandani. We have a big election
[10:33] coming up. And I think people should
[10:35] start paying attention to what's
[10:36] happening in the country at the youth
[10:38] side because of the inability to get
[10:40] jobs and how it is feeling. This is a
[10:43] social situation that is going to be an
[10:45] important macro thing because Donald
[10:48] Trump proposes new stimulus checks of up
[10:49] to $2,000 for Americans. This is the
[10:52] whole point of Bitcoin. This is the
[10:54] whole point of the disruption, not just
[10:55] of AI, which is not something new.
[10:57] Machine learning has been around for a
[10:58] long time. The disruption started with
[11:01] the MAG7. Every single dollar of mag 7
[11:05] growth means less jobs for people. That
[11:08] is the reality of innovation in Joseph
[11:10] Shumpernner and creative destruction.
[11:12] Trump may declare a national housing
[11:14] emergency. What to know? Again, we're
[11:16] going to have to print money and give
[11:18] people money to offset
[11:21] the concentration of wealth that's
[11:22] happening and the concentration of jobs.
[11:24] Measuring the performance of our models
[11:25] on real world tests. You really should
[11:27] read this. This is a new GDP val new
[11:29] evaluation at openout. what measures the
[11:32] value that they're seeing across jobs.
[11:34] They go through a variety of jobs and
[11:36] they're measuring what AI can already
[11:38] do. I showed you the thing with Mker
[11:40] last week um a benchmark on AI frontier
[11:44] models and basically the doing work and
[11:48] measuring what their ability to do
[11:49] already is.
[11:51] Um two critical findings towards a shift
[11:54] uh latest models master exceeded the
[11:56] performance of skilled human experts in
[11:58] approximately 50% of the cases.
[12:01] Again, this is today. These findings
[12:04] strongly suggest we're on the cusp of
[12:06] major changes in knowledgebased
[12:07] industries. The primary impact is not
[12:09] necessarily job elimination, but rather
[12:11] task displacement and job design. So,
[12:16] if you are leadership at any company and
[12:19] do not have an AI plan, can you survive
[12:21] from the competition using AI?
[12:25] No.
[12:27] Basically, if you're not moving ahead
[12:30] with AI, every day that you lag behind,
[12:33] you are falling behind at a pace that is
[12:35] unprecedented. This cannot be ignored.
[12:38] This cannot be something that you don't
[12:40] have a plan in. You need people like me
[12:42] to come in and help out to be able who
[12:44] spend their entire life using it, but
[12:46] also training people on it. It's an
[12:48] important part at this. This is why I
[12:49] started to do this as a job because I
[12:52] could not believe how important it was
[12:53] for this for individual workers. They
[12:55] have to do the same thing. You have to
[12:57] get control of your future career. There
[13:00] will be tons of job opportunities coming
[13:02] out of this. It's going to be the
[13:03] augmentation, but you have to be able to
[13:05] use it. And a lot of places prevent you
[13:07] from using it. So, you must use it on
[13:09] your own. We're back in the bubble thing
[13:11] again. Uh the AI boom is unsustainable
[13:14] unless tech spending goes parabolic.
[13:17] Tech spending is parabolic. I don't even
[13:19] know what people are talking about in
[13:20] terms of a bubble from an investment
[13:23] standpoint. I thought this was a good
[13:24] thing to highlight. Uh the number of
[13:26] IPOs by year. This this is how many IPOs
[13:29] we've had during Chat GBT.
[13:32] Nothing. Here's what we had during the
[13:34] dot bubble.
[13:36] This was what I referenced in a paper
[13:39] this week. IPOs are a great way to go
[13:41] through it. By the way, most of those
[13:42] IPOs are in crypto this year,
[13:43] particularly the ones that have done
[13:44] well. Uh Moonshots, another great
[13:46] episode. They go through the AI bubble
[13:48] from an expert perspective. And again,
[13:50] if anyone knows AI bubbles, those guys
[13:52] do because they're all of the age that
[13:54] they were part of running businesses,
[13:56] end of the dotcom bubble. That's where
[13:58] they made their money. Uh, and they went
[14:00] through and they had a great discussion
[14:01] on it. They obviously said there was no
[14:04] uh.com bubble. Uh, they talked about the
[14:07] supply and demand, uh, which I think is
[14:09] really important in terms of going
[14:10] through uh, for for you guys on the
[14:13] semiconductor side, which I've spent all
[14:15] this time. But they go through how it's
[14:17] not a bubble bubble and they go through
[14:19] all of the different reasons. Listen to
[14:21] it on your own. I'm not going to take uh
[14:22] take you through it. But these quotes, I
[14:25] think in terms of the the discussion,
[14:28] you can go through the scarcity side,
[14:30] the fact that demand is way way way
[14:32] ahead of supply and there's actually no
[14:34] way to get the supply and they talk
[14:36] about that there is no way to get the
[14:38] supply necessary for the amount of
[14:40] products that would be rolling out
[14:41] today. the power is now the only thing
[14:44] stopping the products from coming out.
[14:46] The compute is not an issue at this
[14:48] point uh in terms of it being available.
[14:51] Uh that may change but right now there's
[14:53] plenty of compute. The issue is the
[14:55] demand the power side but one thing is
[14:58] important which I think everyone needs
[15:00] to understand and this is it the latency
[15:02] between capex and returns in the
[15:04] internet era was years. With AI, the
[15:07] payback is immediate. And that's what
[15:09] you're starting to see is that you're
[15:11] going you're already having revenue
[15:13] growth. So the latency between the
[15:15] investments and the revenue growth is
[15:17] there. It may not be big enough, but
[15:19] you're already seeing it. Where in the
[15:21] case of when the buildout happened, you
[15:23] had to wait for it. This is going much,
[15:25] much faster. And it's the speed of
[15:27] expansion, the scope of the disruption,
[15:30] all of these different components get to
[15:32] be really important when you're going
[15:33] through this. And so you have to think
[15:35] about how quickly this stuff is moving.
[15:38] That being said, I just want to make
[15:40] sure it's clear. There are going to be
[15:43] horrible investments and they're not
[15:45] just going to be uh by the VC world in
[15:48] terms of investing. That goes on. How
[15:50] many actual companies do the VCs invest
[15:53] in that turn out to be great. So Jeff
[15:56] Bezos called it an industrial bubble.
[15:58] Investors don't usually give a team of
[15:59] six people a couple billion dollars. The
[16:01] size is massive. They have no product.
[16:03] It is different, but that's because of
[16:05] the speed that's gone on. David Solomon
[16:07] said a lot of capital being invested in
[16:09] our AI will turn out not not deliver
[16:11] returns. Completely agree with these
[16:12] guys. There is no doubt that there is uh
[16:15] money flowing into things, but that's
[16:17] because the opportunity is so big and
[16:19] that's what ends up going on. Uh Jared
[16:22] also highlighted this. This was a great
[16:25] kind of push back from someone who's
[16:27] well respected with inside the AI world
[16:29] as a researcher. Um, as a researcher at
[16:32] Frontier Lab, I'm often surprised by how
[16:34] unaware of current AI progress public
[16:37] discussions are. I could not agree more.
[16:39] I've been in meetings and I've been on
[16:41] podcasts where people have just called
[16:42] it a talking parrot. I I'm I'm in shock
[16:46] at some of the things that I hear when
[16:47] I'm in these meetings by people saying
[16:49] it still hallucinates all this stuff. If
[16:52] you don't use it, you will not have a
[16:53] job. There's no other way around it. It
[16:55] is disrupting everything. think it's a
[16:57] tsunami of progress and it's a tool that
[17:00] can do what human beings do. So whatever
[17:02] you do thinking wise it can do already.
[17:05] IQ's up to 150 and by the time the next
[17:08] 6 months come through it'll be way above
[17:10] that and then 6 months after it will be
[17:12] above. So what he does in this failing
[17:14] to understand the exponential again the
[17:17] current discourse around AI progress and
[17:19] a supposed bubble reminds me a lot of
[17:22] the early weeks of the COVID pandemic.
[17:24] So he's using the mathematic side of how
[17:26] quickly things got out of control.
[17:28] Public commentators kept treating it as
[17:29] a remote possibility or localized
[17:32] phenomenon. He goes through the actual
[17:34] data in here to show the progression
[17:36] that's happening by the time period that
[17:38] it is still on the same line of what it
[17:40] can do. And that's why I said every six
[17:42] months you're going to have new models
[17:44] coming out there. The same thing goes
[17:45] for the evaluations in terms of what
[17:47] they're doing parody with an industry
[17:50] expert.
[17:52] And basically it said it may sound
[17:54] oversimplistic but making predictions by
[17:55] extrapolating straight lines on graphs
[17:57] is is likely to give you a better model
[17:59] of the future than most experts even
[18:01] better than most domain experts. So it's
[18:04] actually still going in a mathematical
[18:06] way that you can forecast going out and
[18:08] that's one of the reasons why the demand
[18:11] just continues to go. So Anthropic
[18:13] released 4.5 its latest bid for AI
[18:17] agents and coding supremacy. I used it.
[18:19] I'm going to show a demo of something I
[18:22] did related to Pterodine. Sora 2 was
[18:25] released the video side. So this is kind
[18:26] of the VO3 for OpenAI. OpenAI also
[18:31] released Pulse which I've used all week.
[18:34] A smarter AI for everyday productivity.
[18:36] What if your assistant didn't just wait
[18:38] for your question but anticipated your
[18:40] needs delivering personalized insights
[18:41] before you even asked. So basically it's
[18:44] a virtual assistant that knows what
[18:45] you're knows who you are, what you're
[18:47] doing. Pulse's daily briefing feature
[18:50] does research overnight while you're
[18:53] asleep on anything that you have in your
[18:56] chats. So when I get up in the morning,
[18:58] it's got all the things that you guys
[18:59] are seeing here. It's got the latest
[19:01] updates. It's got stories. If you want,
[19:03] you can connect it to your Gmail, to
[19:05] your calendar to get what's going on in
[19:06] the morning. The AI agent world is here.
[19:11] Signals theification of AI is real, not
[19:14] speculative.
[19:16] demonstrates that OpenAI is actively
[19:17] working towards systems that act
[19:19] autonomously and not just respond. This
[19:23] is incritically important for margins
[19:25] and it's critically important for jobs.
[19:28] They also announced we're taking the
[19:31] first steps towards agentic commerce in
[19:33] chatpt
[19:35] connecting to Shopify and Etsy.
[19:40] Remember Shopify
[19:42] offered or put stable coins on there.
[19:44] You can see what's happening. The crypto
[19:46] world merging with the AI world. We've
[19:48] got Chat GPT now com converging with
[19:51] Shopify to do shopping with inside your
[19:54] chatbot. And you can pay with stable
[19:58] coins
[20:00] for this proactive argument. Proactive
[20:02] meaning it's now reaching out to you of
[20:03] what you want, what you need, everything
[20:05] along those lines, but in a place that
[20:07] you are and it's actually reaching out
[20:09] as opposed to you have to go to Amazon
[20:11] and then you look, do you need to buy
[20:12] this now? Whatever. it actually knows
[20:14] what's going on and and it's not just an
[20:16] ad that pops up in front of you. Uh for
[20:20] the proactive argument use of the week
[20:21] release of OpenAI and Shopify Etsy the
[20:24] pulse release details behind the set
[20:26] three. So I go through what all of them
[20:28] mean and basically when you get through
[20:31] this
[20:33] you end up in a situation where how
[20:36] pulse aligns and accelerates
[20:39] with everything. So I wanted to just
[20:42] show the synergies with chat GPT's
[20:45] commerce to check out ambitions what the
[20:47] role of pulse is. It's a stepping stone.
[20:49] It helps open AAI start getting users
[20:51] into the eye that chat GPT can do things
[20:53] for you without waiting. It is no longer
[20:55] just a chatbot. So this used to take a
[20:59] long time to do. Think about when Amazon
[21:01] went from a bookstore into everything
[21:04] that it is today. That took a long time.
[21:07] The reason they can do this fast is
[21:09] because they already have close to a
[21:10] billion if not a billion users. And so
[21:14] which companies will take revenue sh
[21:17] which companies will this approach from
[21:19] open AI take revenue share from from
[21:22] Google and ads and shopping Amazon
[21:26] Meta.
[21:28] Think about what I've said repeatedly
[21:30] that AI will cannibalize everything. So,
[21:34] OpenAI, which is not a public company
[21:36] yet and is not part of the S&P 500, is
[21:39] already at a size and a scale big enough
[21:42] to compete with the MAG 7. There will be
[21:45] many, many, many competitors for them.
[21:47] It won't just be OpenAI because once
[21:49] Open AI can do it, a kid in Brazil can
[21:51] build a business that can have the
[21:54] opensource version doing the exact same
[21:57] thing. Once they have AI agents, they
[21:59] can build their own app in Indonesia, in
[22:01] Pakistan, in all these places where the
[22:03] Mag 7 have had global dominance. This
[22:06] will be a revenue take away from those
[22:09] companies. And that is the reason why I
[22:11] keep saying Bitcoin is the only digital
[22:15] company. It's not a company, but it's
[22:17] the only thing with a moat now with AI
[22:19] rising. Claude sign of 4.5. Let's just
[22:22] go through this how this moves things
[22:24] into the proactive narrative. Claude 4.5
[22:28] does the exact same thing. Again, it's
[22:31] allowing for more agentic world. You
[22:33] have to spend the time on realizing how
[22:35] fast this is moving. Hitachi shares were
[22:37] up 10%. Open AI to collaborate on
[22:39] energy, artificial intelligence, and
[22:41] other areas. Open AAI is releasing
[22:43] things, spending money, making deals. I
[22:46] don't see how this doesn't end badly. uh
[22:48] personally. Uh so again, I'm very uh
[22:52] very realistic on this. I think the
[22:54] revenue side is going to be very
[22:55] difficult relative to the spend. When
[22:57] you're spending that much money and
[22:58] you're trying to drive in revenues,
[23:00] maybe you can thread the needle, but to
[23:02] me, it's more likely that those
[23:03] companies, which will grow rapidly over
[23:05] the course of the next three years, I
[23:07] just don't see how they don't run into
[23:09] issues. Corweave Inc's a 14 billion meta
[23:11] deal for the AI demand again. Okay, so
[23:14] now this gets into Pterodine. This is
[23:15] really meant for the retail traders, but
[23:18] it's also meant for hedge fund people
[23:20] running the business. It's also meant
[23:22] for anyone who does investments at a
[23:24] bottoms up basis. Uh, this isn't claude
[23:27] just 4.5. This came out this week.
[23:29] You're this is my prompt, okay? I'm not
[23:31] going to read every single thing. I'm
[23:33] trying to do this with Pterodine.
[23:35] Explain how Pterodine makes money. Break
[23:37] it down. You can see this. Analyze the
[23:39] whole thing.
[23:41] Now, summarize the last four. So I'm not
[23:44] going to show you the output from the
[23:45] one I just went through. I'll go through
[23:47] something that is more interesting to
[23:49] me. By the way, this is multiple pages
[23:51] of work. So this is work that would have
[23:53] taken to do I don't know how many hours,
[23:56] days, whatever. Summarize the last four
[23:59] earnings calls for each call. Do the key
[24:02] messages, the analyst questions, blah
[24:04] blah blah blah blah. Let's just go
[24:06] through some of it. Three biggest policy
[24:08] developments between 24 second quarter
[24:11] 25. It goes through the highlights. All
[24:13] of this takes seconds.
[24:17] And again, I'm not showing you even
[24:19] 150th of the output that came out. Uh I
[24:22] kept asking it new prompt saying, "Okay,
[24:24] now summarize it into the critical
[24:25] questions." But a lot of this stuff it
[24:27] just did on its own. Talks about the
[24:29] surge that happened in why it happened.
[24:31] Called this the inflection point in the
[24:33] Q2 earnings. I remember I talked about
[24:35] it uh probably last week. I think it was
[24:38] the first time. I think I talked about
[24:39] on pump the week before. I can't
[24:41] remember exactly but you can go through.
[24:42] We're now competing for merchant GPUs.
[24:44] We now have an opportunity to compete
[24:45] for merchant GPU testing a market we've
[24:48] been excluded from for 20 years. It is
[24:51] 20 times two times larger than the VI
[24:53] compute which is where the bulk of their
[24:55] business is. So new opportunities
[24:58] that becomes one of the questions they
[25:00] go through it. These are all things from
[25:02] the earnings report in terms of uh the
[25:05] earn most recent earnings call. Now it
[25:08] shows you the shifts in tone
[25:11] in terms of each component. Optimistic,
[25:14] confident, bullish, cautious because of
[25:15] the tariffs, then very bullish, you can
[25:18] go through all this. Does this all its
[25:19] own? I didn't I all I did was give it
[25:21] the um the prompts that you guys saw.
[25:24] And then I asked some questions. So the
[25:25] verdict most important earnings call in
[25:27] years. Terodine finally delivered the AI
[25:29] inflection plus a TAM expansion. Um the
[25:31] bull case is now much stronger. What I
[25:33] didn't do in this thing which I would
[25:35] have is gone through the specific
[25:37] channels from a top- down basis that I
[25:40] believe are going to accelerate. The one
[25:42] thing that AI does not have yet is the
[25:45] ability to look at the things that are
[25:47] coming. So it can only go out and figure
[25:50] out what's been written out there and
[25:52] that's why it could do for Micron what
[25:54] it did with Micron. But if I would have
[25:55] said what's going to happen to Teratime
[25:57] because there's an upgrade cycle coming
[25:58] in phones and computers next year then
[26:01] it'll build that and it'll also go
[26:03] through it. Finally for the technical
[26:05] piece I've shown this to some hedge
[26:07] funds. I have an algorithm that I
[26:09] created. All I have to do is take this
[26:10] chart from Bloomberg, copy it. This is a
[26:12] 5-year chart of Teratine. I just paste
[26:14] it in and then it does all this work and
[26:16] it gives me a total score on this with
[26:18] anything above 70 as in the you should
[26:21] be buying it side. Uh the pattern is
[26:23] good. I'm an Elliot wave person. That's
[26:25] in there. It does all this stuff. I set
[26:27] up the the prompt. It's a very long
[26:29] prompt. It weights these on each
[26:32] component. So, imagine if you had a
[26:34] person that was a good trend following
[26:36] uh analyst, someone who's good with
[26:37] candlestick or chart patterns like bases
[26:40] like John Rogue, candlestick patterns,
[26:42] Elliot wave, this I put them all
[26:44] together and I get a waiting on it. And
[26:45] so if it's all lining up some way,
[26:46] that's a better way to do it. Because of
[26:49] all that stuff and because of the
[26:50] outreach I've had from so many people,
[26:53] uh, from the consulting side, the stuff
[26:55] that I do for people out of my own
[26:57] business, not for 22V, I am going to
[26:59] start putting stuff up on the website,
[27:02] uh, which will be things that if people
[27:04] want them, they can get. It'll be a
[27:05] combination of ideas around themes
[27:08] combined with some of the technical
[27:10] analysis side. So on any of the themes
[27:12] that I've mentioned in the past, I'll
[27:14] probably have one a month related to a
[27:15] the AI side, but then in addition, I'm
[27:18] going to be doing a bunch of training
[27:20] videos that will be on there as well to
[27:21] show people how you can do this on a
[27:23] longer format. Um, I did want to show
[27:25] this because I have a a view towards
[27:28] next year uh with where we are that I
[27:30] think people need to think about. So I
[27:32] do believe small caps are going to have
[27:33] rally. I do believe PMIs are going to go
[27:35] up sharply next year and I think people
[27:36] need to focus on the way their portfolio
[27:38] looks. I think next year is going to be
[27:40] a year against large caps. Not because
[27:42] large caps won't still do well, but
[27:43] large caps have done exceptionally well
[27:45] because of the AI trade. The problem is
[27:47] for a lot of these companies,
[27:48] particularly the ones that you see here,
[27:50] these are all big spenders and a lot of
[27:53] them have bottlenecks already. The
[27:55] question is for like a Seaman's Energy
[27:58] and for a GEV, their gas turbine
[28:00] situation leaves them in an issue. How
[28:02] can you be trading at a multiple if you
[28:04] can't grow things because you can't
[28:05] produce relative to the demand? It's not
[28:08] that these stocks are going to go down,
[28:10] but I think there's an issue. So, here's
[28:12] the Morgan Stanley uh power AI power
[28:14] index, which is the orange line. The
[28:17] problem is you can see how correlated it
[28:18] is to an equal weight of these
[28:22] eight names.
[28:24] This is the concentration factor. For
[28:26] everyone who's massively long these
[28:28] names, I think you have to be worried
[28:30] about what I'm about to show because I
[28:33] can already see it happening. This is
[28:35] everywhere. who makes the data center.
[28:37] Everyone knows these names by now. If
[28:39] they don't know them, they own them in a
[28:41] basket or they've come out and done the
[28:43] bottoms work. Everyone knows that these
[28:45] guys are going to benefit from the data
[28:46] center. The question is, do have they
[28:48] hit bottleneck side. If you want to go
[28:50] read a research report that goes through
[28:51] the data center buildout and at least
[28:53] gets the emphasis on how big it is, how
[28:55] much is going and look for some other
[28:57] names that they haven't listed here.
[28:59] This Catrini Stargate, they did a field
[29:01] trip there. They have a ton of photos. I
[29:03] highly recommend it. I spent time on it.
[29:05] It just shows the massive dollars that
[29:07] are going. This is what you want to
[29:08] invest in for things where you're
[29:10] looking for big big movements. And
[29:12] that's where I think the small cap
[29:13] stocks, as I'm going to show, are going
[29:15] to see a lot of these because of the
[29:17] size of the mega caps relative to the
[29:20] size of where they're going to have to
[29:22] go into. I've been told by many people
[29:24] that have traveled out in the Midwest,
[29:25] they are seeing small businesses where
[29:27] lights are being turned on. Their big
[29:29] issue is, can they get the people in?
[29:31] Can they do this? But they are going to
[29:32] see demand go up for all kinds of
[29:35] widgets that are going to be part of the
[29:36] data center and the utility buildout. So
[29:40] far it's been the mega cap stocks.
[29:41] They've got shortages. So where's the
[29:43] rest of it going to come? The gas
[29:45] turbine situation is one of the most
[29:46] important themes for next year in terms
[29:48] of spreading into small caps in my
[29:50] opinion. So it's not about GPUs anymore.
[29:52] It's all about power. This is from a
[29:54] Google employee working on data centers.
[29:56] So this is all you need. power, lack of
[29:59] available power, reliable power has
[30:01] become the biggest bottleneck for us.
[30:04] Um, they basically talk about the fact
[30:06] they don't have the issue. Supply chain
[30:07] GPUs, which we all want to get GPUs do,
[30:09] we have our own internal TPUs, but GPUs
[30:11] from Nvidia, either we buy them or we
[30:13] can rent them from Coree. All of the
[30:15] winners, that's already there. That's
[30:19] not a big constraint. After CO supply
[30:20] chain was a big one, but now this is all
[30:23] about power. Unfortunately, they all
[30:25] need power. So, you have to do all your
[30:27] research on power. And I'm going to
[30:30] start showing this. I spent the entire
[30:31] week on Power podcast. So, you can go
[30:34] listen to this one. This is with the
[30:35] former Microsoft head of energy. Uh, as
[30:40] we've covered in other recent episodes,
[30:41] the growth of data centers and the
[30:42] massive amount of power they require is
[30:44] reshaping the energy landscape. Today, I
[30:46] want to zero in specific challenge at
[30:48] the heart of all of it, the Watt Bit
[30:51] spread. He's the person that created
[30:53] that line. I think you should listen to
[30:56] it because of this gas turbine shortage
[30:58] risk new energy crunch. I completely
[31:00] agree. I think this is the biggest risk
[31:02] for next year. Everyone has been focused
[31:05] on using natural gas, including the
[31:07] administration. It is very obvious to me
[31:09] in reading everything and doing my work
[31:11] on AI that we're going to get turbines
[31:14] out every year. That's great. But AI
[31:16] demand is going faster. And since the
[31:18] demand is going faster, we have to
[31:19] figure a way to deal with it. the
[31:21] uniqueness of AI power demand, the scale
[31:24] and acceleration, supply constraints.
[31:26] It's not just gas turbines, it's
[31:28] transformers. Supply cannot fix flex
[31:30] quickly, creating bottlenecks.
[31:33] This is something that I think is
[31:34] critical. It's where I spent all of my
[31:37] prompts this week. Every single time you
[31:39] ask someone in the energy side how to
[31:41] get to the demand side, meaning, hey,
[31:43] here's our supply uh stuff for oil.
[31:46] Okay, what what's oil demand? Well,
[31:48] that's spread across the globe and
[31:49] that's nominal GDP. This is moving
[31:51] faster than nominal GDP. But it is
[31:54] controlled by the grid and it is
[31:57] controlled by the hyperscalers. They
[31:59] flip it on, they flip it down. And
[32:01] electricity is completely different.
[32:03] When gasoline goes higher at the pump,
[32:06] then consumers stop spending. In the
[32:08] case of AI, they have unlimited demand
[32:11] at this point. So we have a problem here
[32:14] and it's putting in uh a systemic impact
[32:17] on grid stability and efficiency. So all
[32:19] the hybrid solutions, this is a unique
[32:21] situation. It has to be about grid
[32:22] stability and efficiency. So you have to
[32:24] learn more about what this means and
[32:26] this where these podcasts become
[32:28] important. This creates a new power
[32:30] negotiation dynamic. Hyperscalers are
[32:32] quasi utilities shaping investment
[32:35] there. hybrid solutions with shortages
[32:37] in traditional infrastructure like the
[32:39] ones we mentioned. You need hybrid
[32:40] solutions and they are built around
[32:42] flexible demand response including
[32:45] Bitcoin mining. This is the beginning of
[32:48] something I'm going to say time and time
[32:50] again. AI purest AI trade is Bitcoin.
[32:53] Bitcoin is energy. It has an energy
[32:56] component. There's a mining component.
[32:58] They were the first digital people to
[33:01] build out these centers. They are
[33:03] experts in this field and they actually
[33:05] serve a very very big purpose when
[33:07] combined with batteries and with
[33:09] renewables which is going to have to be
[33:10] one of the solutions. Accelerated
[33:12] renewable integration paired with
[33:14] storage. That's what this side is.
[33:16] Energy efficiency optimization at the
[33:19] hardware chip and infrastructure cooling
[33:20] power levels. You This is a a much more
[33:23] complex thing than I think people are
[33:25] fully ground. This is not just go out
[33:26] and buy an energy stock. This is not
[33:29] just go out and buy uh natural gas or
[33:32] oil or coal. It's much much deeper and
[33:35] it involves grid capacity and
[33:37] flexibility.
[33:39] It is critical to the whole solution and
[33:41] everything that I've spent on. So expand
[33:43] on the fastest to deploy wind, solar,
[33:46] and storage first. So if speed is the
[33:48] issue, these are the ones despite the
[33:50] one big beautiful bill that you want to
[33:51] continue to focus on. I'm going to go
[33:53] through what those names did this week.
[33:54] Battery storage. do your work on battery
[33:56] storage critical to the whole thing.
[33:58] Batteries are needed for flexibility. I
[34:01] will go through the Bitcoin mining side
[34:03] later. How important is flexibility?
[34:05] Flexibility is critical, arguably as
[34:07] important as raw megawatts for meeting
[34:09] AI's electricity. Flexibility means the
[34:11] ability of handling when the loads when
[34:13] they're going up and down because you're
[34:14] competing with retail and commercial
[34:18] along with AI that is there. So, think
[34:20] of it as there's AI demand which is
[34:22] ramping up dramatically. You've got
[34:24] consumer and commercial which is not
[34:26] ramping up dramatically but is always
[34:27] there. But then you get these supply
[34:29] shocks and then you have Bitcoin which
[34:31] is always in there on there but is like
[34:34] a virtual battery where it can turn
[34:36] stuff down when all of a sudden it goes
[34:38] through. And most importantly for the
[34:40] financial side of renewables they help
[34:43] the financial side like a restaurant.
[34:45] So, I want you to remember as I get into
[34:46] the Bitcoin mining later, if you ran a
[34:49] restaurant, you're paying expenses and
[34:53] some of those expenses continue even
[34:55] when you're not serving food. Where
[34:57] Bitcoin mining fits in is during those
[34:59] night times when the restaurant is
[35:00] closed, they're making money and making
[35:02] it more profitable for people to run the
[35:05] business. That's how they help
[35:06] renewables and anything that goes
[35:08] through. So, for everyone who's been on
[35:10] the ESG side and has gone against
[35:12] Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, you've
[35:13] reached a point where you are going to
[35:14] have to get rid of your bias, just like
[35:17] I said with Tesla, and you're going to
[35:18] have to realize without the problem of
[35:22] having a flexible load. Peaker plants,
[35:25] gas peaker plants where you need
[35:26] transformers and gas turbines, they're
[35:29] expensive, they take time, they're not
[35:31] going to be available. So, for everyone
[35:33] who wanted renewables, guess what?
[35:34] Bitcoin is going to help you be more
[35:36] renewable. So, what's been happening?
[35:38] First, solar
[35:40] makes new yearly high, new one-year
[35:43] highs. Fuel cell breaking out. This is
[35:46] all in the last month. Plug,
[35:52] Fluence, Battery, EOS, one I've
[35:55] mentioned. I got to show you this one
[35:56] because I think I first mentioned it on
[35:58] here about 50% ago. Um, all battery
[36:02] players, all things people were involved
[36:04] in at some point. They obviously didn't
[36:06] want to be involved in them anymore. And
[36:07] the reason was because they had
[36:09] disappointed. These were all left for
[36:11] dead for a variety of reasons. The issue
[36:13] is if these guys are going to be a major
[36:15] part of what's necessary for the data
[36:16] center. And you saw the numbers that
[36:18] were being spent. Here's the market cap
[36:20] of these companies. They're in the
[36:23] Russell. If you go through what led the
[36:25] Russell on Friday, these companies did.
[36:28] Look what they are. One month
[36:30] performance.
[36:32] This is how Alpha's created. This is how
[36:34] retail jumps on these themes. Here's lit
[36:37] this uh this battery uh sorry lithium
[36:40] battery the whole thing. Now I just want
[36:43] to make sure because this one's been
[36:44] asked for me because I showed it last
[36:46] week or two weeks ago. Most of the
[36:48] companies in here are Chinese. So just
[36:51] remember with lit it is not even though
[36:53] you can buy it in the US it's not a uh
[36:56] it's not US stocks for the most part.
[36:58] Okay. Now we've got a podcast again I
[37:00] think you guys should listen to. This
[37:01] was on the Ben and Mark podcast which is
[37:03] an A6 16Z uh but it's Ben and Mark is
[37:07] the podcast. Androl CEO China has scale.
[37:10] Can America catch up? This is all on the
[37:12] problem related to manufacturing in the
[37:15] US. But from a military standpoint, this
[37:18] goes into the China US side. I think
[37:19] this is important information for
[37:21] everyone to understand. If the US,
[37:23] China, if Taiwan, China was to invade
[37:26] Taiwan,
[37:28] the war games show us the US exhausting
[37:31] key uh munitions in six to eight days
[37:34] with two to three years to build stock.
[37:37] They talk about this and I this is so
[37:40] important for so many things. First of
[37:41] all, anyone who doubts that we are going
[37:43] to build up manufacturing and PMIs are
[37:45] going to go higher, I I I just don't
[37:48] think you're paying attention to what's
[37:49] happening. This is not just reshoring
[37:51] for reshoring saints. This is reshoring
[37:54] for national security and the government
[37:55] is showing everything it can. Bought a
[37:58] lithium put made an investment in a
[38:00] lithium company. Announced another
[38:02] critical mineral um investment on
[38:04] Friday. Uh already invested in MP that's
[38:07] rare earth already invested in Intel.
[38:09] All of those companies are necessary for
[38:11] modern military but also for AI in some
[38:14] framework. So all of them they're
[38:18] completely aligned. So, like I showed
[38:19] you in the data center, you need
[38:20] batteries. Well, you need batteries for
[38:22] humanoids. You need batteries for
[38:23] drones. Everything is related to the
[38:25] same thing. And all of the choke points
[38:27] on supply,
[38:29] they're all from China. They control it.
[38:31] China's 20 years ahead of manufacturing
[38:32] autonomy. The US edges software. So, we
[38:35] have to spill speed this up
[38:37] significantly. This is not a small
[38:39] thing. So, here's what's happened. The
[38:40] government announces an investment in in
[38:43] LAC. Goes up to five and change. Now,
[38:45] it's doubled from there. Here are the
[38:47] lithium names. Again, look at the size
[38:49] of them. That just shows how little
[38:51] money we've spent doing this. I didn't
[38:54] hear of this stock until this week until
[38:56] someone who called me and said, "Have
[38:57] you heard of this?" Here's another one.
[39:00] Antimony.
[39:02] Um,
[39:04] they put a $250 million. They got a
[39:06] contract win. You go read about it. It's
[39:08] all about munitions for the military.
[39:11] Simple way to look at this. If I was
[39:14] going to bet and I had to pick one thing
[39:16] that three years from now, consumer
[39:18] staples market cap is 3.3
[39:21] trillion.
[39:23] Here is the energy market cap of the S&P
[39:26] 500. Here is the utility. These two
[39:30] combined will be bigger than this.
[39:32] Utilities will probably be bigger than
[39:34] this. If you want to go look at what
[39:35] utilities relative to consumer staples
[39:37] looks like on a 34year chart, utility
[39:41] bills are going higher. Power is needed.
[39:43] It's all on the grid. Prices are going
[39:45] higher. There's no way to solve this.
[39:46] And consumer staples is being disrupted
[39:49] by Ompic and a whole bunch of other
[39:50] things which are only going to get worse
[39:52] with AI. If you want to be long AI, you
[39:54] get long utilities. You want to be short
[39:56] AI or AI disruption, get short anything
[39:59] related to the consumer, but in
[40:00] particular consumer staples.
[40:03] Russell 2000. I've talked about small
[40:05] cats. I get push back on this one. Uh
[40:08] John Ro put this out. We are basically
[40:10] and we did break out finally of a 4year
[40:14] point. All right. Now, these are the
[40:15] weekly charts. I want to show you the
[40:17] monthly because he's showing these
[40:19] patterns how this thing trades and how
[40:21] when it finally breaks out, it's a big
[40:23] thing. Now, if you take the breakout
[40:26] points here,
[40:28] here,
[40:29] here, and now here,
[40:33] PMI,
[40:34] PMI, PMI, and here we are. PMIs are
[40:39] going higher, guys. You can argue as
[40:41] much as you want. You can focus on the
[40:42] monthly numbers. All that matters is six
[40:44] months from now. The stock market
[40:47] discounts what's going to happen. But so
[40:49] does 91% of central banks are cutting
[40:51] rates. Here's the overlay with the PMIs.
[40:53] If you're not playing for PMIs to go
[40:55] higher, I don't get it. Here's the best
[40:59] PMI trade you can have on Bitcoin.
[41:04] Why traditional finance will finally
[41:06] connect Bitcoin to AI. So, I've said and
[41:08] I've given up trying to explain to
[41:10] people why I'm heavily invested in
[41:13] Bitcoin, why it's the purest AI trade,
[41:17] why it will continue to compound and is
[41:19] actually going to accelerate soon and it
[41:21] will be the thing that takes away from
[41:23] this. So, labor market pressures we went
[41:26] through at the beginning. So, you get
[41:28] social unrest, you get more people that
[41:30] are looking for a new system. That's
[41:32] what socialism equals. That's what
[41:34] anything equals. That's what throwing
[41:36] out the incumbents equals. you will
[41:37] continue to have it, but it's getting
[41:39] worse as AI agents come in and there's
[41:41] nothing that they can do to stop it from
[41:43] a corporate perspective because profit
[41:46] margins are being used against that and
[41:49] that drives a bigger gap in the ability
[41:52] for people to afford things because that
[41:54] means the wealthy are getting wealthier
[41:55] and we will not tax them. So, we're
[41:57] trying to build up manufacturing and do
[41:59] handouts. So, we're figuring everything
[42:01] we can. That is the major thing behind
[42:03] it. That has what started Bitcoin. That
[42:04] will happen. the mega caps are going to
[42:06] be under pressure. I can already see it
[42:08] happening and I think the spending is
[42:10] going to be an issue at some point here
[42:12] because I don't think they're going to
[42:13] see the same size of revenues. But more
[42:16] importantly, if the power thing becomes
[42:17] a major issue, they're still spending
[42:19] money, but they can't release new
[42:21] products that can bring in money. That
[42:23] is an issue. They need the power. The
[42:25] dollar weakness. I'm not going to go
[42:27] through this this week, but I will say
[42:29] dollar strength started after the Nikai
[42:31] peaked and it happened and US
[42:34] exceptionalism is all about coding. I've
[42:36] said this to people on the phone. The
[42:39] dollar has equaled coding dominance.
[42:41] Coding is now ubiquitous. The dollar
[42:43] will weaken going forward. Not because
[42:45] of the macro reasons, not because of all
[42:46] the garbage that I hear that people
[42:48] actually think and believe in a linear
[42:50] world where GDP is not a statistic that
[42:52] matters. in a world of massive
[42:54] disruption where AI is going. The
[42:56] problem with the dollar is the US has
[42:59] the most waiting towards coding in the
[43:01] markets. So, it's more of a disruption
[43:03] even though the profit margins are
[43:04] growing. So, I think it'll underperform
[43:06] the rest of the world. But as the rest
[43:08] of the world is a better place to put
[43:09] your money purely from the basis of what
[43:11] I showed you in small caps which is
[43:13] they're tiny and they are going to be
[43:15] making money from AI. You're actually in
[43:18] a point where there's just a rebalancing
[43:20] around the globe which is the
[43:21] democratization of AI. AI is connected
[43:24] to energy which is connected to Bitcoin
[43:27] and the mining side. And then you've got
[43:28] the network effects which are going to
[43:30] start. You've got stable coins. I showed
[43:32] you that before. But then tokenization's
[43:34] coming next year and that is the big
[43:37] boy. Bitcoin was up 10 and a half% last
[43:40] week. Here is what you're looking at
[43:42] over the last 5 years. Seasonality.
[43:45] October up 22%. November up 13. Here you
[43:48] go. These are your next seven months.
[43:50] See if seasonality plays out. But sell
[43:53] in May and go away has been actually a
[43:55] Bitcoin story. Uh I wrote this paper
[43:57] last week. Bubbles lift everyone.
[43:58] Concentration leaves most behind. AI
[44:02] investment into all this will leave as
[44:04] always uh losers. But to focus on in a
[44:08] bubble, you're not making money from
[44:10] that. The concentration is what's
[44:12] happening. There's very few winners. I
[44:14] think it'll spread out next year because
[44:15] again, they need the energy side. They
[44:17] need the building side. They need
[44:18] manufacturing side. That stuff's been
[44:19] left for dead. Those names will go from
[44:21] $3 to $20. They will create a tremendous
[44:24] amount of alpha for people if they do
[44:25] the work. uh they're small which makes
[44:27] it difficult but I'm just telling you
[44:29] it's a lot easier for people to go look
[44:30] in there at this point than go look at
[44:32] Micron at $200 and believe that that's
[44:34] going to continue to produce the alpha
[44:35] that it's produced this year.
[44:37] Concentration leaves most behind and
[44:39] that is positive for Bitcoin.
[44:41] Immad on that moonshots podcast if you
[44:45] want to see what a bubble looks like
[44:46] just look for the next few years in
[44:48] digital assets. I could not agree more.
[44:50] That will show you completely what a
[44:52] bubble looks like. Generative AI is the
[44:54] proper thing. this one will be insane.
[44:56] He's saying that because of the network
[44:58] effects. He's saying that because
[45:00] tokenization is going to open up. We are
[45:02] changing the financial guard rails of
[45:04] the world with crypto. This is as
[45:07] important as anything that has happened.
[45:10] Tokenization is going to bring so many
[45:12] changes to the way the world works. It's
[45:14] a disruptive force. It will get people
[45:16] speculating. Think about what's
[45:18] happening gambling in this country.
[45:19] Think about what's happening with the
[45:20] prediction markets which are related to
[45:22] crypto. This is just the beginning. The
[45:24] story is simple. Trump said America can
[45:26] grow its way out of the debt. What it
[45:27] really means is debasement. Shutdowns
[45:29] highlight the erosion of trust in US
[45:31] institutions. Bitcoin is the pressure
[45:33] valve. That's not bearish S&P. It's
[45:35] bearish dollar. Goldman Sachs.
[45:39] We're at the point now where Bitcoin is
[45:41] becoming part of the traditional finance
[45:42] world. We're going to be dealing with
[45:44] this. How to improve inflation targets
[45:45] without inciting the bond vigilantes.
[45:48] That's already happening. But yes,
[45:49] inflation is going to air on the higher
[45:51] side and they're going to continue to
[45:53] cut rates because the job market will be
[45:54] weak from AI. So you get it both ways.
[45:57] Uh the technical side from John Rog here
[45:59] are the stocks which are growing in size
[46:01] because of the uh the issuance that's
[46:03] come out this year for uh many of these.
[46:05] You've got a bunch of the the miners on
[46:08] here. Four, for those of you who don't
[46:10] know, is John's perfect score, and you
[46:13] can measure which ones are going up.
[46:14] They just continued to get better. So
[46:16] these are ones that went from a three to
[46:18] a four. I would just go spend time
[46:21] because I think the Bitcoin side is
[46:22] going. How Bitcoin mining stabilize the
[46:24] grid. Save Texans$18 billions of
[46:27] dollars.
[46:30] Crypto mining can enhance. Let me go.
[46:32] Investment in renewable energy
[46:34] production and curb overall carbon
[46:37] emissions under suitable conditions.
[46:39] Blah blah blah. You guys can go read it.
[46:42] This is what happened. And this is
[46:45] basically the story of December of 2022.
[46:48] This is really important. If you go back
[46:50] to the issues that happen in Spain, the
[46:52] issues I hear getting close in other
[46:54] places as AI demand grows everywhere in
[46:56] the world, grid stability becomes an
[46:58] issue because renewables are
[47:00] intermittent, you get a grid stability
[47:02] problem where if there's an event like
[47:04] what happened in Texas, which was a
[47:07] wintertime event, which causes problems
[47:10] and it sends everything up and it causes
[47:13] blackouts or it causes them to not have
[47:14] the power to have pipes freeze and
[47:16] everything else, it becomes a major
[47:17] issue. So, Bitcoin mining is now
[47:19] becoming part of the solution for the
[47:21] first time as people realize this. And I
[47:23] think that all AI companies and all uh
[47:27] utilities and grid optimization is going
[47:30] to start to follow what happened in
[47:31] Urkott and the importance. At a minimum,
[47:34] go listen to this podcast and go get
[47:36] more details on that exact scenario.
[47:39] I'm not going to read the whole thing.
[47:41] Please expand on what is discussed with
[47:42] regards to Bitcoin miners, batteries,
[47:43] and AI demand. Again, I gave you kind of
[47:46] an analogy with a restaurant. Um,
[47:49] Bitcoin miners give you flexible priced
[47:51] demand. They turn cheap or stranded
[47:53] electrons. So, again, that overnight
[47:55] example, when prices are low, they're
[47:57] doing stuff. And then when prices get
[47:59] high, they come off of the grid. The way
[48:02] that they help by being on there all the
[48:05] time is they make it more profitable for
[48:07] the companies that are producing the
[48:08] power. So, you can see where this is
[48:10] important mainly if two things are
[48:13] occurring. One, we're getting to the
[48:15] point of running out of capacity. The
[48:18] Texas event was a one-off event. If it
[48:20] happened once every 3 years, Bitcoin
[48:21] miners don't have it. If we're getting
[48:23] to the point because of AI demand that
[48:25] we're there all the time, that makes the
[48:26] risk of having blackouts much higher.
[48:28] That makes the value of them go higher.
[48:30] If at the same time we don't have
[48:33] turbines and we need to do more or
[48:35] higher percentage of the intermittent
[48:37] renewables, you can see where their
[48:39] value is. So for everyone again who
[48:43] doesn't realize Bitcoin miners will be
[48:45] viewed positively for the environment
[48:47] because they actually are going to drive
[48:49] more demand towards renewables because
[48:52] of their ability of handling the
[48:54] intermittent side and being a virtual
[48:56] battery. So, the real value of Bitcoin
[48:58] miners grows at the grid becomes
[49:00] vulnerable and wholesale electricity
[49:02] prices are rising. Like I said, exactly
[49:04] like the PGM uh auctions. That was a
[49:07] question I asked. And then it goes
[49:08] through. Exactly. That's the way to
[49:09] connect the dots. Let's unpack it
[49:11] clearly. Again, this is the way I use
[49:13] it. If you guys want training on this,
[49:14] reach out to 22V. They can find out how.
[49:17] I'm trying to move my consulting
[49:19] business to some degree to help people.
[49:20] I'm there. It's just trying to find out
[49:22] how we can do it. But this is a way for
[49:24] people to figure out how they can get
[49:25] through these themes in a course of two
[49:27] days the way an analyst would, but in a
[49:29] way far with far more breath from both a
[49:32] top- down basis and then go through a
[49:33] bottoms up basis like I showed with
[49:34] Pterodine. And then you can spend the
[49:36] time taking podcast and going through it
[49:38] and saying what ideas are coming out of
[49:40] here that people that are not consensus
[49:41] with people. Um connection to batteries,
[49:44] the grid optimization, improving power,
[49:46] project economics, Bitcoin miners are
[49:49] flexible demand. Again, that's the
[49:50] critical thing. They raised the the load
[49:53] floor in the week hours because Texas
[49:56] needs everything. More gas, wind, solar,
[49:58] batteries. It is a massive place to look
[50:00] at as to what's happening in AI because
[50:02] they are the demand capital. They've
[50:03] done an amazing job with URKT. You
[50:05] should go spend time on it. It's one of
[50:07] the reasons why people are migrating
[50:09] there is because they've been doing so
[50:10] much on this. So again, the gas turbine
[50:14] matters and it goes through as to what
[50:16] it is. And if you thought this was an
[50:17] issue, just remember, and if you go read
[50:20] this article, just type this in to
[50:22] Perplexity, Hong Kong Economic Journal,
[50:25] go read how China has done now the exact
[50:27] same thing. And remember, they attacked
[50:29] the mining industry 3, four years ago.
[50:32] Well, now they're using the miners for
[50:34] exactly the same reason. All right,
[50:36] guys. That's it for this week. Um,
[50:38] thanks for everyone reaching out. I look
[50:40] forward to going through it. Go to 22V,
[50:42] stay on the website, keep looking. Uh,
[50:44] reach out. We're trying to make sure
[50:45] that any retail person that we couldn't
[50:48] do something with since the demand was
[50:50] so high and people want trade ideas,
[50:52] they also want training on AI, not just
[50:53] for them, but for their kids. Reach out
[50:55] there. We'll get stuff on the website as
[50:57] soon as we can. Uh, and I'm looking
[50:59] forward to spending more time with you
[51:00] guys, even if it's just virtually. See
[51:02] you. Bye.
