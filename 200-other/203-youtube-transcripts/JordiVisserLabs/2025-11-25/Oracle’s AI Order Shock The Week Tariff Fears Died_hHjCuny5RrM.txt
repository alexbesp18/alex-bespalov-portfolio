[00:00] First of all, um, thanks to everyone who
[00:03] came out to, uh, Robin Hood and, uh, and
[00:07] the Pomp event. It was great meeting all
[00:09] you guys and, uh, I'm glad you're doing
[00:11] so well trading, building a life for
[00:14] yourself, of enthusiasm.
[00:16] Uh, let's keep it going and try to give
[00:18] you some, uh, some views on the week,
[00:20] but also uh, a lot of stuff on Oracle.
[00:24] Uh, I do think this was the week, the
[00:26] the end, the official end of the tariff
[00:30] fears. I think now that we've gotten
[00:31] through the inflation data, we've got
[00:34] Atlanta Fed GDP now up at 3%.
[00:38] I I think uh I think for the rest of the
[00:42] year, people are just going to have to
[00:43] focus on the fact that the Fed is
[00:45] cutting rates into a situation where
[00:47] manufacturing and the buildout for AI is
[00:50] going higher. And you can have all your
[00:52] views on what you think should happen.
[00:54] You can throw all these magical fake
[00:56] words out like stagflation and uh AI
[01:00] bubbles and whatever else you want to
[01:02] throw out there. You can just keep
[01:03] throwing it out. Uh the job is to make
[01:06] money. The job is not to be right on
[01:08] what you think should happen. Uh
[01:10] particularly when we've been at this now
[01:13] for the better part of six years of
[01:15] people fighting it. So a lot to go
[01:16] through. Let's just go through. S&P up
[01:19] one and a half% for the week. Russell up
[01:22] for the sixth week in a row and again
[01:25] this is the 14th of the last 18th uh
[01:28] weeks that it's been higher. The major
[01:30] news of the week was Oracle
[01:32] uh up close to 40% in one day. Finished
[01:35] the week up 25 a.5% just below a
[01:38] trillion dollars. I'll go through a lot
[01:40] more details on Oracle as it was the
[01:42] most important story. uh tenure rates uh
[01:46] came down intraweek they they got below
[01:49] 4% for a little bit finished up uh
[01:51] around 406 uh this chart was floating
[01:55] around I mean people just don't stop uh
[01:58] but since it's out there you know the
[02:00] bond market is saying there's a
[02:02] recession apparently and the stock
[02:04] market's ignoring it uh
[02:08] if that were the case then VA wouldn't
[02:10] be going lower so Bonvall basically
[02:12] making close to three-year lows
[02:15] and credit spreads are at all-time
[02:19] tights. So, the bond market is just
[02:21] catching up to the reality of the equity
[02:24] market and the reality of the Fed
[02:27] cutting rates. But more importantly, for
[02:29] everyone who has tried to short bonds
[02:31] and think and and has thought that that
[02:33] has been the best trade, I think just
[02:36] this says it all right here. I mean, you
[02:38] can go back uh over a year.
[02:41] uh this uh it's what is it 17 months 18
[02:46] months uh you've had four months where
[02:49] rates went higher for a month. So if
[02:51] you've been trying to play for the bond
[02:53] market to collapse and for rates to move
[02:55] higher since May of last year uh it's
[03:00] just a it's just not the trade. Uh bonds
[03:03] to me are uninvestable. Uh but I also
[03:06] think you don't want to sit there and
[03:08] try to play them as the big play when
[03:10] the administration wants rates lower. Uh
[03:13] we did get
[03:15] 30-year fixed rate mortgages got down to
[03:17] the lowest level uh since uh early 23
[03:22] and they are now 150 basis points off of
[03:26] the peak in 23. And again, this is ahead
[03:29] of Besson and Trump saying they're going
[03:31] to declare a national emergency on
[03:33] housing. I will continue to say you want
[03:36] to be focused on the housing market uh
[03:38] from a long side because the
[03:40] administration has followed through on
[03:42] everything they've said this year. And
[03:43] that's why I'm going to use the old
[03:45] Rounders line. If you can't spot the
[03:47] sucker in the first hour, half hour,
[03:50] that means you're the sucker. And I
[03:51] think that's what has been the story
[03:53] since the tariffs were announced and how
[03:55] many people had talked about recession,
[03:57] stagflation, the deepseek moment, AI
[04:00] buildout's not going to happen. This has
[04:01] been a year of institutional um smart
[04:05] people uh thinking and looking at charts
[04:08] and believing that everything bad was
[04:11] going to happen when the reality is and
[04:13] I'll keep saying it over and over again.
[04:15] If you just spend your time on
[04:16] artificial intelligence and you go
[04:18] through the numbers and you realize how
[04:19] important this is, the impact that it
[04:22] will have on labor, the impact that it
[04:23] will have on profit margins, people have
[04:25] screwed up because profit margins have
[04:27] held up incredibly well despite the
[04:30] tariffs. At the same time that the labor
[04:32] market is weakening, part of that is
[04:34] related to AI. Uh, everyone's still
[04:37] focused on academic stuff that just
[04:39] doesn't matter. And this is one of them.
[04:40] The inflation data came out this week.
[04:42] Uh, CPI came out at point4 382. You can
[04:46] see all the component pieces in here.
[04:48] Uh, you can also see, you know, we've
[04:51] had weaker than expected ones. The
[04:54] reason the market responded is because
[04:56] that's all you got. We waited for all
[04:58] this on the tariffs and all we got this
[05:01] year is something you can't even tell
[05:03] what's gone on. So, this is uh
[05:05] year-over-year core inflation. That's
[05:06] the red line now at 3.1%.
[05:09] Still, and then the white line here is
[05:11] the uh fivemonth
[05:14] moving average of the threemonth core
[05:18] sticky Atlanta Fed inflation. I've had
[05:20] this chart and used it for a long time.
[05:22] So, yeah, I guess you could say, look,
[05:24] we're we're trending higher, but the
[05:26] reality is whether we're at four or two
[05:28] is completely irrelevant for what stocks
[05:30] are doing because companies are making
[05:31] money. I listened to a bunch of podcasts
[05:33] again this week. Uh, and it's funny,
[05:35] everyone who says stagflation says the
[05:37] bulls, the bulls. Why don't people just
[05:40] accept the fact they're talking about
[05:41] garbage? Stagflation is garbage in an AI
[05:44] world. It's garbage. I'll say it over
[05:46] and over again. If you're sitting there
[05:47] worried about stagflation,
[05:50] you're just going to lose money uh
[05:51] chasing things that don't exist. Uh
[05:54] 10ear rates are still way above
[05:57] headline inflation. So again, you go
[06:00] back over time and you see how far above
[06:02] we are here. You see that we just don't
[06:04] have many times in history except for
[06:07] severe drops in inflation where you've
[06:10] had rates this far above. So, I can make
[06:12] the argument still that we shouldn't be
[06:14] any higher than 4%. At a minimum, it has
[06:17] to be something where inflation
[06:18] expectations are moving higher. We had
[06:20] the job revisions. This was obviously
[06:22] known. So, this got the stagflation
[06:24] fears going. Uh, and of course every
[06:27] single newscast and all the media
[06:29] stagflation, stagflation again,
[06:31] completely madeup word doesn't mean
[06:34] anything when you're talking about it
[06:36] from the difference between the 1970s
[06:39] because basically people there's
[06:41] unemployment rate is sitting at
[06:43] incredibly low levels and corporate
[06:45] profit margins are at all-time highs.
[06:47] So, if you're going to pick a word and
[06:49] just pick out two pieces, this is the BS
[06:51] that goes with people who are just
[06:53] sitting there talking about stuff with
[06:54] absolutely no data to support it. Here's
[06:57] what inflation did this week in terms of
[06:59] the swaps market. All of them came down.
[07:02] You got the 2-year, you got the 5year,
[07:03] you got the 10-year. So whatever people
[07:06] were hoping would show up in the data,
[07:08] this was definitely a period in terms of
[07:10] the swaps market from the market that
[07:12] they said, you know what, I guess the
[07:14] tariffs are not going to be as big of
[07:15] inflation deal as we thought. Here is
[07:17] what is happening if the small business
[07:19] inflation as the single most important
[07:22] problem continues to decline. So again,
[07:25] if you're going against stuff where the
[07:27] trend is getting better, uh it's not the
[07:30] story you should go on. And again, what
[07:31] happens to profit margins during
[07:33] stagflation? During stagflation, profit
[07:35] margins usually compress.
[07:38] Profit margins are rising. There's
[07:40] nothing going. We just had unbelievable
[07:42] um corporate earnings. And as I said,
[07:45] the forecast going forward is arguably
[07:48] the strongest in terms of the change in
[07:50] estimates for Q3 relative to the last I
[07:53] think I went through it last week, 5
[07:55] years, 10 years, 20 years in terms of
[07:57] taking it higher at the end of Q2.
[07:59] Here's the profit margin chart on the
[08:01] red side. Again, if tariffs were having
[08:03] an impact, you should see this come
[08:05] down. You've seen profit margins come
[08:06] down as we go into recessions since
[08:09] there are no more recessions, what
[08:11] you're left with is a situation where
[08:13] people are just going to have to get
[08:14] used to this disconnect between the
[08:16] labor markets, which is a new thing. Um,
[08:19] here's one way to look at. So, I've
[08:20] shown this chart many times before. This
[08:22] is the conf conference market conference
[08:25] board employment trends work worsening,
[08:28] but employment is not. And again, you're
[08:32] in a different world. So no matter how
[08:34] you go through it, there is a job
[08:36] situation where people are clearly
[08:38] worried about what's going to happen
[08:40] with uh AI in their jobs. There's
[08:43] anxiety over jobs. Corporates are are
[08:45] big companies are not making it easy on
[08:47] people. Businesses are going through
[08:49] bankruptcies. These are all real.
[08:51] They're all things that happen. But
[08:52] that's not the economy. This is the
[08:54] problem of having a K-shaped economy.
[08:56] But if you're only going to focus on the
[08:58] bottom side of the K-shape, then you're
[09:00] fighting against what Donald Trump and
[09:01] the administration is trying to do.
[09:03] Whether or not successful, you got to at
[09:04] least wait for the data to go. But the
[09:06] problem is the bearish sentiment still
[09:08] remains. So when you have a stock market
[09:10] sitting near all-time highs, you have
[09:11] credit spreads at all-time tights, you
[09:13] have the unemployment rate not budging
[09:14] higher, you have inflation in a normal
[09:16] range, and yet you still have sentiment
[09:18] in terms of investors. I mean, look at
[09:20] this. It's come all the way back down to
[09:21] almost where it was when we came out of
[09:23] Liberation Day. And this is not just one
[09:26] sentiment gauge. I want to highlight
[09:28] this. So Helen Mistler puts out this
[09:31] sentiment poll each week. I don't really
[09:33] care about the fact that two weeks in a
[09:35] row it was negative. What I care about
[09:36] is we have this rapid rise in a bull
[09:39] market. Look how many weeks are negative
[09:41] versus how many are positive. I already
[09:43] showed you how many weeks have been
[09:45] positive on the Russell and yet it's the
[09:47] complete opposite for sentiment during
[09:49] bull markets. This is normal. This is
[09:53] normal. So you end up as you're going
[09:55] higher every week as they expect it to
[09:57] go higher. The sentiment is horrific for
[09:59] institutions right now. There is
[10:01] absolutely no doubt that sentiment is
[10:03] much much worse than where it should be
[10:05] given everything that's happening. Uh
[10:07] I've highlighted the fact that this
[10:08] Goldman Sachs one has been my favorite.
[10:10] Now look where we were coming into the
[10:12] year. This is when the market went down.
[10:14] We are still sitting here. We've been
[10:16] here for almost the entire year. So,
[10:18] anyone who wants to argue about
[10:20] sentiment, just think about it. Stocks
[10:21] alltime high, home prices alltime high,
[10:23] blah blah blah blah blah, and the Fed's
[10:25] cutting rates, and yet somehow magically
[10:28] we have sentiment sitting at lows. If
[10:30] that's not academic BS, I don't know
[10:32] what it is. People sitting there
[10:34] believing this can't be real. This is a
[10:36] podcast, the only real podcast I'm going
[10:38] to recommend you listen to this week. I
[10:40] heard plenty more where the stagflation
[10:42] stuff was brought up and where they
[10:43] called out everyone like me who is
[10:45] mocking stagflation, but it has nothing
[10:47] to do with making money. If you listen
[10:50] to this podcast, I I don't know this
[10:52] person, Aan Menon. I've heard him now
[10:54] twice. It is, no offense to him. He's
[10:57] kind of boring, but the reason it's good
[11:00] is because boring is just factual. He
[11:02] does everything in data. He's very, very
[11:05] articulate about the things going on in
[11:07] the economy. I would go listen to it.
[11:09] Here are the highlights.
[11:11] US economy is in a business cycle
[11:13] expansion. Consumer spending is
[11:15] resilient. Business investment is
[11:17] modestly rising. And financial
[11:19] conditions aren't restrictive enough to
[11:20] derail growth. That's just logic. That's
[11:23] just the facts of what is happening. You
[11:25] can say stagflation. This doesn't
[11:27] mention stagflation. The center of this
[11:30] cycle is tech IP. So AI yes on AI capex.
[11:33] Go through it. 90% of personal
[11:37] consumption expenditures categories
[11:39] expanding. That is inconsistent with a
[11:41] consumer-led slowdown. These are the
[11:43] diffusion things that you have to pay
[11:44] attention to. The labor market looks
[11:47] weak for atypical reasons. Again, he's
[11:50] acknowledging all of the things that
[11:52] people are saying. Manufacturing is
[11:54] showing green shoots after a multi-year
[11:56] profit squeeze. I'll get more into this.
[11:57] This is something I've talked about.
[11:58] PMIs are going higher. I believe they're
[12:00] going to get close to 60 next year. And
[12:02] people are going to have to adjust all
[12:03] based on AI. Bonds are unattractive.
[12:06] See, he's bearish bonds. He believes
[12:09] labor is weak.
[12:11] Commodities turning constructive on
[12:13] industrial metals. Liquidity backdrop is
[12:16] benign. Bank reserves flat. So all the
[12:18] people that follow this liquidity stuff,
[12:19] I get asked about it all the time. Some
[12:21] guy Michael How telling you everything
[12:23] is going to be horrible. Blah blah blah.
[12:25] This just continues. Guys, focus on
[12:27] artificial intelligence. Another thing
[12:30] he posted an X go sign up for it. Orders
[12:33] are also rising strongly while inventory
[12:35] is generally low. Between the nominal
[12:36] sales orders, very early PMI
[12:38] indications, profit estimates and pro,
[12:40] it looks like very early manufacturing
[12:42] recovery. Again, he deals in factual
[12:45] stuff. Here are the datas that are
[12:47] supporting what he just talked about.
[12:48] And again, I want you to look at all of
[12:51] these things that are trending higher in
[12:54] terms of the manufacturing side. I've
[12:56] shown charts like this in terms of the
[12:57] capital goods orders, the IP diffusion
[13:00] side, the percentage of uh of companies
[13:04] that are now turning positive in terms
[13:05] of this from negative. We've been in a
[13:08] long-term bare market in IP and PMIs.
[13:11] That's the main story. We're coming out
[13:13] of something that's been going on. And
[13:16] acknowledging again the AI impact on
[13:20] employment. This is the information
[13:23] technology output for GDP
[13:27] and yet no labor increase. Again the
[13:29] tech side anything related to AI AI
[13:32] agents are coming the infrastructure
[13:35] side the inference side it all means
[13:37] that this is going to have pressure
[13:39] continuously on labor. There is no back
[13:43] test on this. There was no AI impact on
[13:46] labor 20 years ago. This is a completely
[13:49] new thing. So, it's garbage in, garbage
[13:50] out for all these data points and all
[13:52] these recession signals and all of these
[13:54] things that have gone on in the past.
[13:57] They don't matter. That's the reason why
[13:58] we've been able to have PMIs at such a
[14:00] low level. All during chat GPT, all of
[14:03] the PMIs below 50 occurred during Chat
[14:05] GPT. Profits went higher and now we're
[14:08] starting to see the buildout. So, we get
[14:09] this deal early in the week. Microsoft
[14:11] signed 17.4 billion AI deal with Nebus
[14:15] to grow its AI cloud business more
[14:17] aggressively. So that started the week
[14:20] and then we got this. Everyone who's a
[14:23] macro person who has not gone through
[14:25] the numbers on Oracle, I'm going to put
[14:27] them into context.
[14:31] The orders that they received
[14:35] are up 359% from last year, but from the
[14:39] prior quarter, $317
[14:43] billion. We've signed significant cloud
[14:45] contracts with a who's who of AI,
[14:48] including OpenAI, XAI, Meta, Nvidia,
[14:50] AMD, and many others.
[14:53] RPO RPO, so orders will likely grow to
[14:56] exceed half a trillion dollars. They're
[14:58] already 400 something, so it's not that
[15:00] big of a deal. Much of the revenue is
[15:02] already booked in our 455 billion RPO
[15:06] number, and we're off to a fantastic
[15:07] start this year. Again, these numbers
[15:09] are insane.
[15:11] You've got Larry Ellison's quotes here.
[15:13] Some of these I went through but the
[15:15] most important thing for moot a lot of
[15:17] people are looking for inferencing
[15:19] capacity. So again inferencing thinking
[15:22] AI agents the whole next stage what I've
[15:24] written about time and time again I
[15:26] wrote the inference moment back in uh
[15:30] April after we got all the earnings
[15:32] reports where everyone basically was
[15:34] saying we're now running out of
[15:35] inference capacity. So this is not a new
[15:37] story. This is something that you could
[15:40] have been invested in. You could have
[15:42] been involved in because this story has
[15:44] been growing. But because every time
[15:45] there's a little story about AI's not
[15:48] being adopted or some BS about there's
[15:51] nothing going on, people keep missing
[15:53] these just like the administration has
[15:55] been signaling what they're going to do.
[15:57] These comments are there. We're running
[15:59] out of inferencing capacity. I talked
[16:02] about VO3. I talked about all of these
[16:04] models. I talked about what it means for
[16:06] Tesla in terms of you turning video into
[16:09] decisionmaking. This is a neverending
[16:12] situation of inference that will
[16:14] continue to grow at a rapid pace. Listen
[16:16] to moonshots and you'll get the story.
[16:18] Training AI models is a gigantic multi-
[16:21] billion dollar market. That's what the
[16:23] first phase of GPT was. So this is the
[16:26] first phase, the training models. It's
[16:28] hard to conceive of a technology market
[16:29] as large as that one, but if you look
[16:31] close, you can find one that's even
[16:33] larger. It's the market for inferencing.
[16:36] We need the power for this. This is what
[16:38] I'm going to continue to emphasize. He
[16:40] he mentions that he's now dealing not
[16:41] with the the CTOs or some person in the
[16:45] back office putting in an order. He's
[16:47] dealing with the CEOs, the heads of
[16:48] government, the heads of state. Everyone
[16:50] wants it. I think demand is going to be
[16:52] insatiable.
[16:53] It's the speed of acceptance. Everything
[16:56] is moving rapidly here. So, as an
[16:58] example of, you know, something I I
[17:01] wrote about for 22V, but also it was my
[17:04] stock pick for the year purely based on
[17:06] inference. Again, what does this mean
[17:08] for Micron Technology? High band high
[17:11] bandwidth uh demand.
[17:14] Here's what the stock did. So, it's up
[17:16] close to 100% this year now after this
[17:18] week. This is a big company. These are
[17:21] the types of things that are happening
[17:22] in the alpha being created. If you're
[17:24] focusing on 10ear rates going up to 4
[17:26] and a.5 instead of 425, it's a waste of
[17:29] time. If you're not allowed to trade
[17:30] equities, then go spend time now on the
[17:32] power trade because that's the next
[17:34] phase of this. Or go spend time on
[17:35] countries that are going to supply the
[17:37] commodities that are necessary for the
[17:38] build out of this. The next time someone
[17:41] fades AI strength, just send them this.
[17:43] Oracle's 317 billion order increase from
[17:46] Q4 to Q1 represents approximately 81% of
[17:50] the entire US economy's quarterly
[17:52] nominal GDP.
[17:55] Like I just don't know what to say if
[17:57] you're sitting there fading the size of
[17:59] AI and that this is a bubble. These are
[18:01] orders. He said the revenue has been
[18:03] booked. Uh, someone posted a post on
[18:07] this and basically said, "Unpack why
[18:09] Jord's AI aided assessment lends
[18:11] credibility to his work verse random
[18:13] opinions on X. He grounds claims in
[18:16] verifiable data." Thank you. Not me, not
[18:20] vibes. Unlike random takes that lack
[18:23] sources or calculations, think
[18:26] stagflation.
[18:28] These are facts. This is a number. This
[18:31] is what they reported in order. If all
[18:34] they talk about, which is what I heard
[18:35] on podcast, was CPI coming in at 0.02
[18:40] higher than what was expected, but PCE,
[18:44] it's just blah blah blah. There's
[18:46] nothing valuable in that. Nothing. Zero.
[18:49] The Fed is letting inflation run at a
[18:51] higher rate. We have an administration
[18:52] that's going to replace the Fed chair
[18:54] with someone who wants to run it hot.
[18:57] Make money. Don't care about this stuff,
[18:59] but find the trades that are there.
[19:00] Eventually the charts will favor rates
[19:02] going higher maybe, but that is not the
[19:05] case. You've been stuck in a range for
[19:06] this entire time. So maybe if the PMIs
[19:08] do go to 60, maybe if oil goes up to 85,
[19:11] at that point we'll get CPI above four
[19:14] instead of 2.9% and at that point maybe
[19:17] it'll be a trade. All right. So then I
[19:19] go through and say give me uh the power
[19:22] needs for these numbers. So this order
[19:26] I asked ChachiPT to do this. 273 billion
[19:28] of power. Oracle's future energy needs
[19:31] equal 90% of Japan's total consumption.
[19:34] 155% of Germany's electrol electric uh
[19:37] electricity system. 21% of total US
[19:40] electricity. Okay. I don't trust
[19:41] anything I get from AI because they have
[19:43] hallucinations. They do faulty stuff. So
[19:46] then I go into Gemini and check the
[19:47] work. Can you please do the same
[19:48] analysis of that order? Blah blah blah.
[19:50] It goes through. It comes up with an
[19:52] answer. And the only thing I care about
[19:53] is it is important to note that the
[19:55] result of this analysis is highly
[19:57] sensitive to the initial assumptions. A
[19:59] slightly higher electricity price or
[20:01] lower percentage of revenue would
[20:02] drastically change final number.
[20:04] However, even with the conservative
[20:06] assumptions, the scale of power needed
[20:08] for this level of AI infrastructure is
[20:10] staggering. That's the only thing you
[20:12] need to do. You invest in staggering. I
[20:15] want to be long staggering. I don't want
[20:18] to be long stuff that sits in a range
[20:20] for three years trying to play when it's
[20:21] going to break out. I wrote this paper
[20:23] on hybrid solutions. So here's my
[20:25] analysis that I did spending a lot of
[20:28] time from a top- down systems uh
[20:30] thinking perspective to go backwards and
[20:33] basically say how is this going to be
[20:35] dealt with since we don't have enough
[20:37] power. Nuclear can't solve it. Fusion
[20:39] can't solve it. Fision can't solve it.
[20:41] So how are we going to solve it?
[20:43] Everything comes up as hybrid solutions.
[20:45] Now, why AI is the new electricity
[20:48] across silos. The problem with this is
[20:50] to solve the power problem. This is not
[20:53] just go out and buy oil. This is not
[20:55] just go out and buy natural gas. For
[20:56] everyone who's sitting there saying,
[20:58] "Well, there obviously isn't any more
[20:59] power needs because oil is not going
[21:00] higher and natural gas is going higher."
[21:02] We don't even have the plants built yet.
[21:05] So, you don't need the commodities. If
[21:07] you're building a restaurant, you don't
[21:09] buy the food before the people come in
[21:11] into the restaurant. So this should be
[21:14] pretty much second nature to people on
[21:15] the way this works. The company should
[21:17] be seeing the orders come in and you
[21:19] should be able to make money on the core
[21:21] on on the companies. So I ran a report
[21:24] created on the AI data center investment
[21:26] thesis navigating the supply chain
[21:28] demand supply mismatch. So I did a
[21:31] 40page paper to go through all of the
[21:34] places of where we're going to need to
[21:37] do the hybrid solutions meaning
[21:39] everything that goes on. This includes
[21:41] the cloud infrastructure, the energy and
[21:42] grid infrastructure. And within these
[21:44] components are tons of stuff,
[21:46] transformers, switch gear, power
[21:47] distribution, everything that will be
[21:49] necessary that you should be seeing the
[21:52] demand show up for companies. Then I
[21:54] included the compute needs because that
[21:56] was just the power. So what's going to
[21:57] be needed on the compute? There's
[21:59] micron, not surprisingly. But as you go
[22:01] through this, you get all of these name,
[22:03] a bunch of these names. These are not
[22:04] all the names obviously but the reason
[22:06] this is important and for you guys to
[22:08] understand to map out the power and
[22:10] compute names into the level three gigs
[22:13] we're talking about a lot of industries
[22:14] we're talking about a lot of electrical
[22:16] component this involves caterpillar this
[22:18] involves um Cummings this invol in
[22:20] involves eventually packar this involves
[22:23] every single commodity company as you go
[22:25] through them eventually we're at the
[22:28] very early stages of this so these are
[22:30] all of the the places that show up in
[22:32] here it's not just like it is for a boom
[22:35] in oil where okay kerosene u uh diesel
[22:40] gasoline that's not the story here this
[22:43] is a much bigger thing in terms of all
[22:45] of the components so it spans these
[22:48] sectors these are all the sectors that
[22:50] are impacted so the problem is if you go
[22:53] to a technology person and say what are
[22:55] the power needs they got to go to the
[22:58] utility person or the energy person the
[22:59] reason I'm doing this is because this is
[23:02] a macro macro theme. AI is not a
[23:04] technology theme. It is a macro theme.
[23:06] The power needs are associated. You will
[23:08] make lots of money on these. But then
[23:10] this also as you go through it, there's
[23:13] commodities that are involved that are
[23:14] necessary for the buildout. Once it gets
[23:16] going, so it's massive. Copper is the
[23:19] new oil for the grid buildout.
[23:20] Everyone's heard this. There is no way
[23:22] to get enough electricity. So what I did
[23:25] again through 22V, I said, "All right, I
[23:28] know everyone's going to ask and look
[23:29] for companies. So give me a 100 public
[23:32] companies that are likely to benefit
[23:35] from this between 2025 and 2030 again
[23:38] while we're not going to have the
[23:39] nuclear buildup. So show me everything
[23:41] in the supply chain. I organized it
[23:43] where the bottlenecks and dollars are
[23:45] most likely to flow. And I want to make
[23:48] sure that the companies that you're
[23:50] showing me have already in their
[23:52] commentary showed me recent earnings and
[23:54] IR evidence that demand is already
[23:56] showing up. So I connect to earnings
[23:59] commentary through an API. I run all
[24:01] this. I create basically a program for
[24:03] it. I run it and it breaks it down and
[24:06] goes through all of these different
[24:07] components. Lists me the hundred names
[24:10] and then I give those to John Ro and
[24:12] John Ro goes through and attaches a
[24:14] scoring system next to all of them. So
[24:15] if you guys want to talk about this,
[24:17] call 22V. We can go through it. I
[24:19] highlighted one company here, Mastic.
[24:21] Okay? It's an engineering and
[24:22] construction company. Just as like a
[24:25] general sense as to what is there. I
[24:29] know we didn't use the word data center
[24:30] but the reality is the data center is
[24:32] driving so many pieces of our business
[24:33] right now.
[24:35] Expect data center driven to be a couple
[24:37] hundred million dollars. This was back
[24:38] in 24 alone. We've now accelerated. They
[24:41] just spoke at uh the Morgan Stanley
[24:43] conference. Data center build.AI. It
[24:45] impacts a lot of different things that
[24:46] we do. Not just from the pure
[24:48] construction of those facilities, but
[24:50] for the needs of power and
[24:51] interconductivity of communications that
[24:54] these facilities are going to require.
[24:56] It is a big driver across our end
[24:58] markets. You have to realize that this
[25:01] is a much bigger story than just hey
[25:05] Google blah blah blah. We're past that
[25:06] point. Those guys are spending the
[25:08] money. So here's a lower ranked one. I
[25:10] gave you a one that was a number four
[25:11] for John. Here's a number two. Antio
[25:14] Resources. Let's go look at theirs.
[25:16] Okay, natural gas demand. They're
[25:18] focusing on that. We're also going to
[25:19] have exposure to local demand from data
[25:21] center growth. This position for data
[25:23] center natural gas demand surge. So
[25:27] again, they're talking about what's
[25:29] going to happen in their power plants.
[25:31] The reason I wanted to bring these guys
[25:33] up, here's their chart, their stock
[25:35] chart. The white line here, this is them
[25:38] overlaid. The green one here is Chevron,
[25:40] which has been acting better. I've
[25:41] written about this. They have to benefit
[25:43] from this. and the XLE which is
[25:45] unchanged. You'll notice this time
[25:47] period here early 22. I wonder what that
[25:50] chart looks like that you guys will
[25:52] remember at some point during this
[25:54] thing. All the energy stocks are sitting
[25:56] there. Beautiful basing formation.
[25:58] Eventually those are going to get fours
[26:00] on John score if the power needs are
[26:02] what I think they're going to be and
[26:03] eventually we'll have energy join in. So
[26:06] what I want you to realize is these
[26:08] charts were very similar. So this is BW
[26:11] and BE Bloom Energy and Babcock and
[26:13] Willox.
[26:15] These charts were left for dead in in
[26:18] terms of uh I mean these stocks are were
[26:22] were left for dead. They've been
[26:23] declining all the way into the end of
[26:25] last year when they finally do get a
[26:28] bid. Here's Bloom Energy. I must have
[26:30] talked about this name with a bunch of
[26:32] people because it kept showing on my
[26:33] list of companies that were already
[26:35] having conversations and then all of a
[26:37] sudden a deal happens with guess who?
[26:39] Oracle. And the stock goes up to where
[26:43] it is now almost 70. When I was having
[26:45] these conversations, it was around 30. I
[26:47] think the initial ones were in the 20s.
[26:49] And again, this was just showing up on
[26:51] screens that I was doing similar to
[26:52] that. Now, Babcock and Willox actually
[26:55] came from one of you guys who just said,
[26:58] "Hey, I your story is resonating. I'm
[27:00] finding companies like this more and
[27:02] more. Here's a company that was trading
[27:04] at 50 cents back in in at the lows of
[27:09] Liberation Day. It is now up to $2.78.
[27:13] They primarily make boilers.
[27:15] Uh so in Bloom Energy's case again the
[27:19] story Oracle Oracle is Bloom Energy's
[27:22] first direct hyperscaler client. They
[27:24] are looking at every energy company
[27:27] looking for solutions. Babcock and
[27:29] Wilcox surge in AI demand from power
[27:32] centers. This is where you need to look
[27:34] for things. This is where you need to go
[27:36] find things. Um Chris Wright spoke on
[27:39] the All-In podcast. You should listen to
[27:41] it. Um, I think there's even like an a
[27:45] good discussion in there as to why
[27:47] people should continue to focus on
[27:48] solar. That's my own thing. It's been
[27:50] thrown out. Um, batteries and solar and
[27:53] all the green stuff, the renewables
[27:56] because of the one big beautiful bill.
[27:58] People said, "Okay, I can't be involved
[28:00] in there." That's not the case. We need
[28:01] all power. And Chris Wright talks about
[28:04] the fact we need all power, but we need
[28:06] to focus on the proper allocation of
[28:08] resources to make sure that we're
[28:10] getting the power there. and there's no
[28:11] subsidies involved. So, it's just worth
[28:14] listening to to go through the thing and
[28:16] actually hear what's happening. Now, I
[28:17] want to go back to what I said, which is
[28:19] remember the chart. So, this is a chart
[28:22] of the PMI, which is the the pinkish
[28:25] line here. Uh
[28:28] uh yeah, and then you've got the IP
[28:30] here. So, IP year-over-year is the white
[28:32] line, which is already up at the highest
[28:34] level since basically around here. The
[28:37] green line here is the six-month
[28:38] diffusion. So this is similar to what I
[28:40] showed from the Prometheus Ahan uh
[28:43] menon. You've already got this stuff
[28:45] going higher. This line here is really
[28:48] critical because this is basically when
[28:50] chat GPD started and when the PMIs went
[28:54] back under there. Oh, it's the exact
[28:57] same thing as when the energy stuff
[28:59] started to consolidate. So if PMIs go
[29:01] higher, I showed last week, every time
[29:03] PMIs have gone up to 60,
[29:07] at some point during that movement, you
[29:09] get oil prices that are up
[29:11] year-over-year 60%. I don't think oil
[29:13] prices are going to go up that high, but
[29:15] I do think there is a floor on oil as
[29:17] PMIs go higher and that eventually we
[29:20] will get the surprise of all energy
[29:21] prices including natural gas going
[29:23] higher next year as this build out and
[29:25] as the PMIs get rolling especially if
[29:28] housing's a part of it and everything is
[29:30] you will get a transition. it will be
[29:32] negative for the mag the mag 7 in terms
[29:35] of what I believe will be happening
[29:37] which is running it hot getting
[29:38] inflation higher eventually moving rates
[29:41] somewhat higher not as high and
[29:42] collapsing as people want but I do think
[29:44] the pressure is going to be there and I
[29:46] think the spending companies are going
[29:48] to have an issue now we are doing all of
[29:51] this with the PMIs about to move higher
[29:54] we are got three rate cuts in now for
[29:56] the next three months uh into the market
[29:59] so that's just a fact. That's what's
[30:02] going to go on. This is not a fact. This
[30:05] is just BS. How bad. This is an article
[30:08] meant to get you people to send it to
[30:10] me. This is an article meant to get
[30:12] people to click on it. This is an
[30:14] article meant to get people to click on
[30:16] it. How long are you going to fall for
[30:18] this crap? Um, I go back to this thing.
[30:21] Verifiable data unlike random takes that
[30:24] lack sources or calculations. That's
[30:26] what those are. Uh this is the reason
[30:29] why the uh cover on YouTube for my video
[30:33] is the tariff fears finally end. People
[30:35] throw in the white towel. All right, so
[30:37] let's finish this up. Tesla
[30:40] again, not surprisingly, uh kind of fits
[30:44] the PMI model starting to go higher.
[30:47] Tesla had a huge week. Uh there was
[30:49] really no reason for it. I hear
[30:51] speculation that people think the
[30:53] vehicle sales are going to surprise on
[30:54] the upside. This is not a car company,
[30:56] guys. I don't give a whether they
[30:58] have uh car price or car sales going on
[31:01] or not. This is about robo taxis and
[31:03] energy. End of story. Mega Vegas was
[31:06] there. So, when I was in Vegas for Robin
[31:08] Hood at the same time, Tesla was having
[31:09] a mega Vegas to show their new Mega
[31:12] Bloks systems that can power 400,000
[31:15] homes in under a month. This is a major
[31:18] major major part of Tesla's long-term
[31:21] plan is the battery storage. Tesla Mega
[31:23] Block is a gamecher. The stock is
[31:25] rising. Again, I spend time on this.
[31:27] There are no battery companies big
[31:29] enough to deal with the needs that we
[31:31] have for both the data centers, but also
[31:33] the roll out of the robo robo taxis and
[31:35] humanoids. We don't have enough
[31:36] batteries. So, over the next 5 years, do
[31:38] your work on what's necessary. Um,
[31:42] Tesla's Mega Block, the perfect solution
[31:44] for Oracle's 455 billion AI
[31:46] infrastructure boom,
[31:49] represents a 19.2 billion revenue
[31:51] opportunity from Oracle alone. And
[31:53] basically all I'm doing is going through
[31:54] what is necessary in terms of having
[31:57] batteries for these data centers and
[32:00] what Tesla can do because they can
[32:02] supply them. The two biggest battery
[32:04] places in the world
[32:06] are Chinese. Those are not going to be
[32:08] the ones doing our data center. So Tesla
[32:11] I believe is the largest in terms of
[32:13] making this these kind of blocks and the
[32:16] only provider with proven AI data center
[32:19] deployment. He used this in his
[32:22] Colossus. Everyone's going to go to Alon
[32:25] Musk to ask how to do it. And he's now
[32:27] got something to sell to them. So Alon
[32:30] Mus has already validated the Tesla
[32:31] approach at their Colossus Super Center
[32:33] in Memphis. I'm telling you, I am
[32:36] shocked at how many people just sit here
[32:39] and fade Tesla and really hate it. I
[32:43] cannot believe how many smart people do
[32:45] this on Wall Street. I had to do a minor
[32:48] debate with someone who I understand why
[32:50] he doesn't like it purely from a
[32:52] valuation basis which I get because it
[32:54] is like Bitcoin. It's all on the future.
[32:57] But the future is he paid 17 billion to
[33:01] buy Echoar. If you want to go hear Alon
[33:04] Mus speak, he spoke this week again on
[33:06] the All-In podcast. Go listen to it. See
[33:10] if you're biased. Check it at the door
[33:11] and just realize what he is building.
[33:14] The Echoar thing for Starlink is going
[33:16] to be competition for phones. Go listen
[33:18] to the satellite thing. Go think about
[33:20] what's happening on the battery side. Go
[33:22] through the robo taxi. All of those are
[33:24] accelerating. And I will say this to
[33:26] everyone who wants to listen on all
[33:27] forms. If you are underweight Tesla as a
[33:30] benchmark for next year that to me will
[33:33] be the biggest contributor to global
[33:36] returns from an alpha basis next year.
[33:38] That's what I believe is going to happen
[33:40] because I do believe the robo taxi stuff
[33:42] has made a level based on everything
[33:44] that is public knowledge that at some
[33:47] point next year people will start going
[33:49] through the numbers on optimists in the
[33:51] future and realizing what I said over
[33:53] the last three weeks. The vision bet
[33:55] that he has make if it pays off it will
[33:58] get people to focus more and more on the
[34:01] humanoid side now because of how big the
[34:04] opportunity is. So go watch that video I
[34:07] said from Adam Jonas and at least know
[34:09] the numbers. If you are benchmarked to
[34:12] something that has Tesla, which is
[34:13] everything, and if you're underweighted,
[34:16] which I'm sure no one was really
[34:17] underweight, the Mag 7 in general, that
[34:19] would be the one they'd be underweight.
[34:21] I'd be very, very wary. I think there's
[34:23] an opportunity for it to double or
[34:24] triple next year on the frontloading of
[34:27] the humanoids if he gets this right. If
[34:29] he doesn't get it right, I still think
[34:31] it's going to be the best performing
[34:32] NAG7 stock purely on the energy side and
[34:34] some of the expectations on the robo
[34:36] taxi side. Google Cloud forecast 58
[34:38] billion revenue boost by 2027. Again, 58
[34:42] billion. That number only looks small
[34:43] now because of the $455
[34:46] billion number I showed you from Oracle.
[34:48] These are massive numbers. Um, you can
[34:51] go uh to this site and go read the
[34:54] backlog and stuff and everything in
[34:56] there. Open eye says spending to rise to
[34:58] 115 billion through 20 may rise to 150
[35:01] million about 80 billion more than
[35:03] previously expected. Again, I'm going to
[35:04] say this over and over. I do not believe
[35:06] these companies are going to spend money
[35:10] good. Meaning, I'm not sure that where
[35:12] the revenues are going to come in to
[35:13] completely justify the valuations of the
[35:16] companies.
[35:18] I just don't see it from my own work in
[35:20] it. I just don't know how they're going
[35:21] to translate this into big dollars. I do
[35:24] believe there's going to be a
[35:24] misallocation of resources. I do believe
[35:26] the spending will lead to stuff that
[35:29] three years from now, four years from
[35:30] now will be stuff that isn't used.
[35:32] There'll be new technologies. We won't
[35:34] need the buildouts of all of these
[35:35] energy plants because we'll make
[35:36] advancements. AI will deal with this,
[35:39] but not now. So, these companies, I do
[35:42] think their free cash flow yields are
[35:43] going to be an issue. But the one thing
[35:45] you can't say, capex, boom, bust, the
[35:48] spending is going to keep happening.
[35:50] Oracle just showed you that there's a
[35:52] back order. Gas turbines back order.
[35:54] Focus on the things where supply and
[35:56] demand are in a mismatch. The e the EIA
[36:00] increased uh electricity consumption
[36:03] this week.
[36:04] China
[36:06] the best performing market. So I've
[36:08] highlighted China a bunch of times. I
[36:09] it's still amazing how many people fade
[36:11] this as well. And I understand it.
[36:13] People don't own Tesla. They don't own
[36:15] China. Some people own China that are
[36:17] trading the thing. But from an investor
[36:19] standpoint, people don't want to be long
[36:21] these things. China's the best
[36:22] performing market. This is the CQQ up
[36:25] 38% year-to date. Then you've got the
[36:27] MSCI China. We hear everyone talk all
[36:31] year long about Europe. I just want to
[36:33] highlight to all of those people about
[36:35] the American exceptionalism, all this
[36:36] blah blah blah. I see this stuff out
[36:38] there every day. Europe is unchanged
[36:41] since February 14th. Unchanged. The Euro
[36:44] stocks. So, for everyone who's been
[36:47] sitting there, I it's unchanged. You've
[36:49] got all these markets breaking out at
[36:51] this point. Uh you've got new highs
[36:53] coming on everything and people are
[36:55] still focused on on places that just
[36:57] don't matter. Here's the chart on CQQ
[37:00] when we were on the Robin Hood event.
[37:01] John Ro was on stage with me as well as
[37:04] um Vinnie Daniels
[37:07] and uh we all agreed on this from three
[37:09] different perspectives. So I like it
[37:11] from the AI perspective in terms of
[37:13] competition and from what they're doing
[37:15] uh on terms of the hardware side. So
[37:17] everything being related to technology.
[37:18] John likes the chart because of his
[37:20] famous bases and it breaking out. And
[37:22] Vinnie liked it because of the
[37:23] valuation. So from a China perspective,
[37:25] it's still hated. You got a lot of
[37:27] positives going on. I think the Chinese
[37:28] market will continue to be a dominant
[37:30] force as we break out here. Open AAI
[37:33] GPT5 Pro. I just want to emphasize this.
[37:36] I said this last week. This was put out
[37:38] um by Andre Carpathy. It's just
[37:42] it is an unbelievable thing to use this
[37:45] model. What you can do with it, what it
[37:47] does after 15, 20 minutes and comes back
[37:50] with software, whatever you want. It is
[37:53] an amazing thing. So for people that are
[37:55] fading GPT5 and I highlighted that the
[37:58] peak in a lot of these AI trades was on
[38:00] August 7, August 8th, which was a day
[38:02] after GPT5 when it got all panned by
[38:04] this. People are missing the boat on how
[38:06] much the advancements are. And I just
[38:08] thought this was good. I ran a case by
[38:10] GPT5 Pro is a doctor from our 89,000
[38:13] strong physician Facebook group
[38:14] yesterday. You have to read the stories
[38:17] and just realize what's happening. It's
[38:19] solving problems and this is what's
[38:21] going you have 150 IQ friend now that
[38:24] you can have a conversation with whether
[38:25] you're a doctor or you're a hedge fund
[38:27] person or anyone in the markets and you
[38:29] can do work. That's what I used to do
[38:31] all of the reports that I did on this uh
[38:33] and as a systems thinking approach which
[38:36] I like to do which is start from a top
[38:38] down macro basis and then break it into
[38:39] each of the verticals. It is phenomenal
[38:42] at that. Uh just highlighting again
[38:45] they don't believe that the money supply
[38:47] matters. It's just like the pope not
[38:48] believing in Jesus. Um Trump is not
[38:50] going to stop with the PAL thing. Wants
[38:52] 50. Uh Besson brought this back to
[38:55] inequality. Again this is important. I
[38:58] think this fits in with the
[38:59] manufacturing side, with the housing
[39:01] side. They are focused on the
[39:02] rebalancing. It has not ended. Finally,
[39:05] Bitcoin, we've been consolidating up
[39:07] here. Here's the monthly charts. I
[39:08] highlighted that we were down for a
[39:10] month. Uh, normally the next month is
[39:13] up. You're starting to get the signs.
[39:16] All of these charts are breaking out.
[39:18] Now, I'm not going to go through all of
[39:19] these. These are all a bunch of the
[39:21] ecosystem that says to me that we're
[39:23] starting to get the community in there
[39:26] ahead of the rate cuts. I would watch
[39:28] how these things trade in the weeks
[39:29] after the rate cuts. This stuff could
[39:31] get explosive. And here is the
[39:33] consolidation. Caleb put this out this
[39:35] week. I think looking at the total
[39:37] crypto market cap is important. We are
[39:40] still near the levels we were there.
[39:42] We've been consolidating in my opinion
[39:44] during tons of good news. We are
[39:46] unchanged. We are about to go lunar. So
[39:50] for everyone on the crypto side, this
[39:52] has been a long year of kind of
[39:53] consolidating. This is a bullish
[39:55] formation. Once we get above the
[39:57] tailwinds of all of the stable coin, the
[40:00] genius act, the network effects that are
[40:02] happening, circle IPO, getting everyone
[40:04] invested in it, but also for next year,
[40:06] if I am right about PMIs going higher,
[40:08] if I'm right about energy prices going
[40:10] higher, if I'm right about inflation
[40:12] staying in a sticky perspective, but
[40:14] also inching higher, possibly taking
[40:15] rates higher at the same time that the
[40:17] people that are spending the money are
[40:19] the MAG Seven, which are a massive part
[40:21] of global things, you need to find an
[40:23] innovation place that is moving higher.
[40:26] And I think the innovation place that is
[40:27] moving higher on the technology side
[40:29] which will become more and more
[40:30] inevitable people is crypto. So next
[40:32] year is the big year. The third wave uh
[40:34] of an Elliot wave move in my opinion. Uh
[40:37] it's going to be explosive. This was
[40:39] basically one wave up. I think we're now
[40:41] about to do the third wave up on this
[40:42] and this is after a long consolidation.
[40:45] That's it for me this week guys. Uh
[40:47] again, thanks to everyone who watches.
[40:49] Hit subscribe. Uh it was great seeing
[40:51] all you guys at the events. Uh, and I
[40:53] look forward to seeing you guys more and
