[00:00] too so let's uh let's just get started
[00:02] uh I'm going to start this off and make
[00:04] sure the the point of this entire video
[00:06] is that there will be no recession that
[00:09] is uh you guys hear me say it there's no
[00:12] such thing as recessions anymore but I'm
[00:14] going to go through this and and make
[00:16] you realize how important it is if you
[00:18] can get to that point because it'll be
[00:21] the place that puts the bottom in uh the
[00:23] Tariff chaos
[00:24] continues uh although we kind of reached
[00:27] a a point where I think we went from
[00:29] bearish to the Panic stage the hedge
[00:31] fund to leveraging continues but there's
[00:33] some signs that at least for the uh the
[00:36] US market neutral Equity side it looks
[00:39] like it's reached a point of uh uh of at
[00:42] least short-term bottom uh I'm going to
[00:44] go through rad alio kind of direct you
[00:47] guys towards why the the tariff plan for
[00:50] me is getting clearer there seems to be
[00:52] a Playbook here that's been released and
[00:54] I think it's important to spend time on
[00:56] it because it'll go back to why I don't
[00:57] think there uh will be a session CU I
[01:00] don't think they can afford it um
[01:02] important bullish AI signs there's some
[01:05] stuff happening that I've been watching
[01:08] uh related to some companies that I
[01:10] think and some prices that I think are
[01:13] uh incredibly important for this year
[01:14] from a structural basis and then uh
[01:17] we'll go through AI humanoids and uh and
[01:20] Bitcoin so in terms of the recession it
[01:23] started off with Trump giving an
[01:25] interview on Sunday and basically saying
[01:27] I hate to predicts things so he wouldn't
[01:29] say there wouldn't be a recession uh
[01:31] we've got the just the gyration
[01:33] continuing and people are starting to
[01:35] realize especially after the 200% wine
[01:37] comment uh that uh anything he says on
[01:41] this he can make the stock market go
[01:42] down and it seems like he doesn't want
[01:44] the stock market to go higher so it'll
[01:45] probably have a hard time sustaining any
[01:47] rally until he's done negotiating I'm
[01:49] not going to bend at all
[01:52] um just refuses to give in this is the
[01:56] 200% uh basically anyone who attacks him
[02:00] on the Tariff side he comes back and
[02:02] just increases the number by sometimes
[02:05] two times sometimes four times whatever
[02:07] the case is he's we're just in this
[02:09] point of of clearly using uh social
[02:12] media to uh keep the tariffs going uh
[02:16] whether us is setting for recession or
[02:18] Jessa down now I'm just going to go
[02:20] through the stories of what went on this
[02:22] week in terms of people getting more and
[02:23] more scared uh we did see stocks
[02:26] basically cut guidance uh on the back of
[02:30] the fact that they're seeing people pull
[02:31] back on spending anyone who didn't
[02:33] believe this was going to impact the
[02:34] economy uh and there were a lot of
[02:37] people last weekend even who reached out
[02:39] after I sent out the email on my video
[02:41] that said they didn't see any weakness
[02:43] in the consumer they don't see how this
[02:44] is weak uh anyone who doesn't see the
[02:46] impact that this is having and doesn't
[02:48] realize we live in a polarized economy
[02:50] everyone who didn't vote for Trump
[02:54] absolutely believes the economy is
[02:56] headed downward and you see this in
[02:58] stuff like this the you Mish data which
[02:59] comes out when you break it down by uh
[03:02] parties which I'll go through later you
[03:04] start to see numbers like this this is
[03:06] uh important data in terms of overlay
[03:09] this is from from Renaissance macro and
[03:12] and Jeff de graph uh basically showing
[03:14] how in the recent numbers um this is the
[03:17] one- Monon payroll change meaning the
[03:19] gray lines here so this is where we are
[03:20] right now and this is the drop off that
[03:24] we've seen uh in terms of consumer
[03:26] sentiment on unemployment during the
[03:28] next year so people believe there's
[03:30] going to be a recession in at least a a
[03:33] high majority of people in the in the um
[03:36] survey uh Larry Summers came out said
[03:39] 50% uh T I wonder if they'll start
[03:42] putting tariffs have raised the
[03:43] probability of no recession to around
[03:45] 65% instead of trying to continue to get
[03:48] people all freaked out BMW uh talked
[03:50] about earnings hits from the tariffs as
[03:52] this spread bundesbank warned that the
[03:54] US tariffs could put Germany into a
[03:55] recession uh Bill Dudley uh who seems to
[04:00] really hate all of Trump's policies uh
[04:03] former New York fed Governor basically
[04:07] uh said these tariffs will be worse than
[04:08] the markets things and I'll go through
[04:10] some of that but he basically went
[04:11] through and said uh the puts the FED in
[04:13] an impossible position where they won't
[04:16] be able to lower rates because of the uh
[04:19] inflation staying higher while growth
[04:21] slows um the reason we are seeing the
[04:24] consumer you can see this on here we've
[04:26] got a spike going on in in recession
[04:28] everywhere we look this is not just
[04:31] something that is made up people are
[04:33] scared um
[04:35] Delta on that guidance we saw companies
[04:38] start to pull back on corporate spending
[04:41] um and consumer spending start to stall
[04:43] uh remember that I showed this last week
[04:46] and this is from Apollo and Torsten
[04:49] Schock who put this out this is H from
[04:52] the consu the conference Board number I
[04:54] mean this is a really important chart
[04:57] this one seems to be less impact Ed than
[05:00] you m but you still have a big drop off
[05:02] in vacation which is a big part of the
[05:05] economy now uh in terms of what's going
[05:07] on I think vacation spending has now
[05:09] surpassed Auto spending on an annual
[05:11] basis so when you see that kind of
[05:13] collapse it is an important thing and
[05:15] then uh as I highlighted last week facts
[05:17] said this is a big drop off in the EPS
[05:21] forecast you basically have no growth
[05:23] for you have negative growth for the
[05:25] first half of the year now they still
[05:27] have it coming back quickly and that's
[05:29] one of the important things is I think
[05:30] the market is still figuring when we get
[05:32] the Tariff uh details that we can have a
[05:35] bounce and I happen to believe this is a
[05:37] stall uh and that's why I said I'm going
[05:39] to keep going through this I don't I
[05:41] there just in my mind there can't be
[05:43] recession for the reasons I've mentioned
[05:44] in the past we're not going to lose 1
[05:46] and a half% of employment or two million
[05:48] people in jobs because of tariffs uh and
[05:51] then them not be able to get jobs for
[05:53] you know a couple years that's just not
[05:55] going to happen uh we have a labor
[05:56] shortage that's there and we have an
[05:58] economy which is driven more by the
[06:00] technology and the service side which
[06:01] just means it's less cyclical uh so it
[06:03] would have to be a huge thing where
[06:05] where people really lose jobs and
[06:07] although you can always have a situation
[06:10] uh like that if it did happen I think it
[06:11] would be like 2020 and we'd have to
[06:13] print tons of money and get going again
[06:15] and have the economy going within a
[06:16] short amount of time because
[06:17] structurally everything's fine uh in
[06:19] terms of tariff
[06:21] announcements from earnings calls it's
[06:24] huge and it's not just one sector so
[06:28] just to show um companies this is
[06:31] percentage of companies in each industry
[06:33] I mean this is across the board so if
[06:35] anyone thought this wasn't going to have
[06:36] an impact it has absolutely had an
[06:38] impact and when you start seeing signs
[06:41] like this so first of all in terms of
[06:42] the the correction it was the seventh
[06:45] fastest 10% slump on record and that's
[06:48] going back to 1929 so uh it's it's
[06:52] literally
[06:53] created a big a big fall uh and it's led
[06:57] to 401K investors are trading most in
[07:00] four plus years in pursuit of safety uh
[07:04] this is how we're going to a panic stage
[07:05] and I'm just going to show JC pet he he
[07:07] put this I got the same calls and I love
[07:09] lots of other people that got the same
[07:11] calls uh my mom didn't call and the
[07:14] person who I use is kind of the person
[07:15] who always calls in this didn't call but
[07:17] other people did call and said how much
[07:19] should they sell out of the market uh to
[07:21] deal with what's going on uh this is my
[07:24] favorite uh bull bear spread uh it can
[07:27] hang as you see for long levels of of
[07:29] time uh up at up at good levels it can
[07:32] sit up here and the bull market can
[07:34] continue but this is a massive drop off
[07:36] in the II uh bull bear spread I showed
[07:40] last week Ned Davis which is one I like
[07:42] that's their aii everybody's now in that
[07:45] side and that's why uh I'm we'll go
[07:49] through kind of where we are in terms of
[07:51] uh uh the possible bounce hedge funds
[07:54] continued they started getting there was
[07:56] you know news out in terms of how big
[07:58] the losses were I talked about this last
[07:59] week uh the
[08:01] drisking
[08:03] uh historic I mean you're talking about
[08:06] big ones here and times where we had
[08:08] them in the past uh you know these were
[08:11] big Market neutral events I did a
[08:13] webinar for 22v if you guys are
[08:16] interested in seeing the work I'm doing
[08:17] during the week and some of the Deep
[08:19] dive stuff I'll remind you just go to
[08:21] 22v um they're an Institutional research
[08:24] place you can reach out uh on the
[08:25] website
[08:27] there uh just go through some of the
[08:30] factors again to show how the recession
[08:32] is being built in this is the 3-month
[08:34] earnings revision uh just a complete
[08:37] collapse uh down the S&P has not gone
[08:40] down as much which to me is why this has
[08:43] been an unwind and a lot of levered
[08:45] hedge fund positions that were
[08:47] positioned for growth it ended up being
[08:49] uh a shock in terms of the growth side
[08:52] and so you've got three Monon revisions
[08:54] so think of companies like paler and uh
[08:57] even the mag 7 the ones that have had
[08:59] had good earnings and still have their
[09:01] revisions that have gone higher I showed
[09:03] last week inidia those are the ones that
[09:04] have been hit the hardest uh and that
[09:07] just shows you that this was people
[09:08] taking off leverage uh in position so as
[09:11] of right now it's a rotation it's not a
[09:13] recession and I'll go through some of
[09:15] the some of the other places why uh
[09:17] equal weight consumer uh discretionary
[09:20] vers Staples I put all these lines in
[09:22] here because it has been leading uh and
[09:26] it led here we had a Divergence we had a
[09:28] Divergence here at the bottom this is
[09:29] what you want to look out for in my
[09:31] opinion um because at some point people
[09:33] will get comfortable that there's not a
[09:35] recession and that this is a Slowdown
[09:37] and it'll start to put consumer
[09:39] discretionary back on I think that's
[09:40] when the market will already be in an
[09:42] upswing I actually think the S&P is
[09:44] going to bottom before but I would just
[09:46] keep pay attention to that if we do have
[09:48] another leg down we started to impact
[09:50] the global stuff too so this is the
[09:53] 3-month
[09:54] revisions Factor but this is for the
[09:57] globe and this is msci World X Theus so
[10:02] we finally started to see msci World X
[10:05] the US this had been a rotation out we
[10:07] started to hit a different point last uh
[10:11] last week that's a little danger
[10:13] position so you're going to want to see
[10:14] more stability in the market this week
[10:16] if we make another few days we're going
[10:19] to retest I'm sure because I don't think
[10:21] the Tariff news is going away uh until
[10:23] he's done with the negotiations so
[10:24] there's going to be a lid on the market
[10:26] so we'll get a bounce at some point
[10:28] we'll fail and then we'll head back down
[10:30] I'm sure and whether we take out the
[10:31] lows is going to be dependent on that
[10:33] earnings revision and seeing weakness in
[10:35] things like the Dax uh in Chinese stocks
[10:38] places where it's been hidden so far if
[10:40] that occurs that would be when I think
[10:42] we'd see a different type of fallof a
[10:45] big a bigger uh move in the
[10:47] S&P we also have another issue here uh I
[10:50] created an index of the private Equity
[10:52] companies this is the six big priv
[10:54] listed public private Equity companies
[10:56] uh so they've Fallen sharply this Orange
[10:59] line here is what I use as a proxy for
[11:02] the lowest level of uh of of credit so
[11:05] this is actually Triple C's relative to
[11:08] high yield uh inverted uh or sorry this
[11:11] is the return Total return so it's
[11:13] starting to break down so it had been
[11:15] hanging out and now all of a sudden it
[11:16] is breaking down I only worry about this
[11:18] if we if if they take this too far and
[11:21] it spreads into the private credit
[11:23] markets uh we've had a big you know
[11:25] obviously uh fundraising in private debt
[11:29] I don't think we're going to get to that
[11:31] point uh but if we did get there it
[11:33] would show up through those things going
[11:35] down and make it harder for refinancing
[11:37] we did have some uh high yield deals
[11:39] canceled this week so we have started to
[11:41] Impact Credit it's just beginning uh I
[11:43] think if there's another leg lower it
[11:47] credit will be the main thing to watch
[11:48] and I think that's where the fed and the
[11:50] government would start to become a
[11:52] little bit alarmed and uh I believe
[11:54] there's a trump put I think it's further
[11:56] down in terms of the equity Market uh
[11:57] but the credit Market could go go first
[11:59] uh B uh this is the mag 7 we hit a 20%
[12:02] correction so again we're in territory
[12:04] here
[12:05] where you've gone down far enough uh on
[12:08] companies that are not having a the same
[12:10] thing they ran into this year where they
[12:12] had negative earnings so you've come
[12:14] down sharply on the mag s from an RSI
[12:16] basis uh we hit the lowest level since
[12:20] 19 so I'm going to start going through
[12:22] some oversold charts because I think the
[12:24] bounce that
[12:26] happened uh should continue for a little
[12:29] while uh or at least some consolidation
[12:31] down here today was the first time that
[12:33] all four major indic ETFs uh daily Sr
[12:37] trading below 37 since the lows in
[12:39] September 22nd so another oversold
[12:42] indicator we did hit is the ball how far
[12:44] outside the Ballinger band we are so
[12:46] we're below the bottom end of the
[12:47] balling the Ballinger band uh so we had
[12:51] been down around here kind of equivalent
[12:54] to this one and somewhere in so we reach
[12:56] kind of panic levels uh on or oversold
[13:00] levels on that uh the equity consumer or
[13:03] equal weight consumer discretionary
[13:04] versus Staples was actually the most
[13:06] oversold on a 15-day basis uh except for
[13:10] covid uh so we had enough liquidations
[13:13] there and breath continues to hang in
[13:14] there so I keep showing I showed this
[13:16] last week I'm going to show it again
[13:17] this is why right now this is just a
[13:19] rotation breath came down yes finally it
[13:22] started to come but then it bounced back
[13:24] and this was actually the best breath
[13:26] day of the year and it was bigger than
[13:28] any negative breath day so breath is
[13:30] still good meaning stocks it's still a
[13:32] rotation at this point the headline
[13:34] index is down but it's still a rotation
[13:35] this is another way you see it's just a
[13:37] rotation at this point this is the
[13:38] percentage of S&P 500 companies that are
[13:41] below the 200 day moving average uh I'm
[13:44] sorry above the 200 day moving average
[13:46] we're still at
[13:47] 41% when we've made uh important Bottoms
[13:50] in here we've actually gotten down
[13:53] towards the 20% level so this is why I I
[13:56] I think you have to be cognizant that
[13:59] lower another low is seems like a high
[14:03] probability just based on the
[14:05] uncertainty over the tariffs and the
[14:07] fact that we're not going to get
[14:08] anything there uh I do believe if I had
[14:11] to pick a range if you take from down
[14:12] 10% off the highs I think he could take
[14:15] a correction down to 15 in the S&P which
[14:18] would mean
[14:19] another uh another 5% off the correction
[14:23] maybe it can be down 15% at some point
[14:26] during the year and this is what I
[14:27] wanted to show these are the yearly
[14:29] numbers for the S&P so if you start with
[14:32] there's not going to be a recession well
[14:33] there wasn't a recession here but we did
[14:35] have two quarters of of negative GDP but
[14:37] this was also when the FED rais rates
[14:39] dramatically uh this is 2018 this is
[14:42] kind of the one scenario that I guess I
[14:44] could see this was the dot bubble but
[14:47] aside from that you pretty much have to
[14:49] have a recession to have a fall that
[14:51] gets you to 10% which would be another
[14:53] five down so I'm leaning towards the
[14:55] fact since I said there won't be a
[14:57] recession uh the government can't afford
[15:00] it and we're not seeing signs of it but
[15:02] I do think stocks they still want stocks
[15:04] to go lower and I'll go through the
[15:05] reasons why uh and that means it's very
[15:09] difficult to fight against what they
[15:10] want other than the earnings and looking
[15:12] at this but when you have earnings
[15:13] estimates going down and you're seeing
[15:15] signs of slowing in the economy you have
[15:17] to think that'll show up in earnings for
[15:19] q1 and I think that's when we'll start
[15:21] to realize this so for the next month or
[15:23] two unless there's a dramatic shift and
[15:26] you start getting some uh some changes I
[15:28] don't think they want it to go higher uh
[15:30] so we'll see what happens claims the
[15:32] four-week moving average still in the
[15:34] middle of this is nothing I mean there's
[15:37] nothing showing up you're going to see
[15:39] people laid off and this includes any
[15:41] federal workers who would have but
[15:43] remember they're getting paid through
[15:44] September so this is the way they're
[15:46] staggering this so it doesn't have an
[15:47] impact uh I just wanted to highlight the
[15:49] one-year inflation expectations I mean
[15:52] this is just amazing Democrats 6.5%
[15:55] Republicans almost zero um which means
[15:59] almost everyone put zero so these
[16:00] numbers are completely useless when you
[16:02] look and you see the headlines highest
[16:04] inflation expectations for one year in
[16:06] the history of the
[16:07] uh uh of the survey uh you can just go
[16:12] through the sentiment is the exact same
[16:14] thing Republicans 83% or 83 is the
[16:17] number 41 so um you really can't use the
[16:21] the data one thing that did go on this
[16:22] week with the inflation data um it was
[16:25] better than expected for the for the
[16:28] headline CPI the pce core is now estim
[16:32] uh estimated to be higher when that
[16:34] release comes out so the CPI itself uh
[16:37] continues to move lower and again this
[16:39] is the Atlanta fed sticky uh 12 Monon it
[16:44] continues to point straight down and the
[16:46] most recent reading for the month is
[16:48] below this so inflation is gradually and
[16:52] continually going that way and you have
[16:54] true flation uh which is down here and
[16:58] this is a relevant number I I wouldn't
[17:00] sit there and say that this doesn't have
[17:02] some uh reality to it uh it is an
[17:05] overlay over the course of time and I I
[17:08] I'd say I'd probably rather use that
[17:10] type of index but you got to use the
[17:11] government ones because that's what the
[17:12] market follows but the true flation
[17:14] index uh is is down low and I think you
[17:17] have to keep that in mind because if the
[17:19] government is successful at slowing
[17:20] nominal GDP which is what they're trying
[17:22] to do down to say 4% but inflation comes
[17:25] down a little bit more than what people
[17:27] expected or we don't get the inflation
[17:29] that people are are are betting are
[17:31] betting on at this point in terms of the
[17:33] market uh you you can have GDP hang
[17:36] around a little bit higher levels than
[17:38] than maybe um everyone's expecting at
[17:41] this point because nominal GDP coming
[17:43] down to four from five uh is not going
[17:45] to be a recession um egg prices I showed
[17:47] when they had gone up well they've come
[17:49] down sharply so what the government did
[17:51] has worked at this point uh okay they
[17:55] want the market down they've had this
[17:56] huge correction they got it back to
[17:58] where it was on September 12th uh we had
[18:01] been hearing in the market in every
[18:02] podcast with a macro person saying
[18:04] that's bessin and Trump and everyone was
[18:07] targeting tenure rates to go low and we
[18:09] heard about this great move from here to
[18:11] here uh great it's down 50 basis points
[18:14] I hear everyone talking about how
[18:15] successful it's been well back in
[18:17] September 12th uh we were at 370 so uh
[18:21] something is keeping rates from falling
[18:24] if the stock market has round tripped
[18:25] all the way back we've seen the City
[18:27] Surprise index come down we've SE people
[18:29] worried about a recession and we haven't
[18:31] got rates down and the reason is cuz
[18:33] what has happened with the tariffs part
[18:35] of the offshoot is China and uh uh
[18:39] Germany are spending money and or I'm
[18:41] sorry yeah spending money and at the
[18:43] same time you have Japanese yields going
[18:45] higher so yields around the globe are
[18:46] actually moving higher uh and that's
[18:49] keeping us yields from coming all the
[18:50] way back down because they are it is
[18:53] they are they all go together so unless
[18:55] you're going to get a recession if we're
[18:56] going to have 2% growth I don't think
[18:57] 10e rates are going to be to make it
[18:59] down there I don't know how they're
[19:00] going to be able to get it uh to where
[19:01] they want uh I I'm going to shift this a
[19:04] little bit d Ray doio
[19:06] spoke last week uh or two weeks ago on a
[19:09] panel in a in Singapore I believe but he
[19:13] made this comment I'm sorry this was in
[19:14] an interview that I would listen to on
[19:16] odd Lots uh Bloomberg Odd Lots you can
[19:18] go listen to this uh with Tracy Alaway
[19:21] and Joe it's it's good uh I listen to it
[19:24] because I spent a lot of time with Rayo
[19:26] stuff this week and I'll go through the
[19:28] reasons why but this he warned about how
[19:31] they have about 3 years to get this in
[19:34] check uh and I'm going to go through the
[19:36] reason why Bank of America put something
[19:38] out basically saying the same thing uh
[19:41] and this is what I want to emphasize to
[19:44] everyone who doesn't believe in what the
[19:46] government's doing or think this is just
[19:48] being done recklessly we need to do
[19:51] something now um there's a reason why
[19:53] now and we can't kick the can down right
[19:55] down the road right now we have to do
[19:58] something to get the deficits in check
[20:00] we have to do something to keep this
[20:01] from spiraling and the government really
[20:04] only has this period of time to be able
[20:06] to do this so the question is what are
[20:08] they actually doing and this is why I'm
[20:10] going to go through go through uh the
[20:12] Ralia stuff but growth has been enabled
[20:15] by unsustainable government support
[20:17] absolutely true uh make take time for
[20:19] private sector job growth to accelerate
[20:20] for government works blah blah blah this
[20:22] was a Bank of America putting out that
[20:24] it's worth doing this and they just
[20:26] highlighted that we're very dependent on
[20:28] the government we have been so we have
[20:29] to start moving away from bigger govern
[20:32] and more towards the private sector
[20:34] which is what the administration is
[20:35] trying to do now stepen mirin who's in
[20:39] who's part of the national um he's part
[20:43] of the administration in the uh the
[20:46] national uh economic committee uh so I
[20:49] would uh go read this is my substack I
[20:53] did a whole thing on where the Trump put
[20:55] is uh he talks and he wrot wrote a paper
[20:59] back in November that has laid out
[21:02] pretty much what the administration is
[21:04] doing when it comes to the Tariff side
[21:07] and other sides but he also brings in
[21:09] there that you have to be careful the
[21:12] markets and I think that's what we're
[21:13] we're we're getting to now is that in
[21:16] Ray Doo's interview on the all-in
[21:19] podcast which was late January January
[21:21] 28th you can go in there and I think he
[21:23] does a great job uh like he did on the
[21:27] odd lots of explaining history of the
[21:29] scenario that the US is in and why they
[21:32] have to do this or within three years in
[21:35] his opinion uh think of it as we're
[21:38] going to have an auction that fails uh
[21:40] and that's worse for the economy than
[21:43] trying to quickly get us back to 3% of
[21:46] GDP so he wants the deficit to go from
[21:50] sevenish back to three that number may
[21:53] sound familiar because that's exactly
[21:55] what Scott Besson is calling for and
[21:57] when you go through through the ralio
[21:59] side which I'll keep going bence 333 is
[22:02] related to getting the deficit down to
[22:05] three keeping real GDP at 3% how to get
[22:09] this and this how do you do that well
[22:11] Ray Doo goes through that and one of the
[22:13] things also is to pump out 3 million
[22:16] barrels of oil a day um and this is the
[22:19] way he writes about it it's called a
[22:21] beautiful deleveraging four levers are
[22:23] moved in a balanced way so the printing
[22:26] of money and debt monetization
[22:29] think of it as okay stimulative the
[22:32] stimulation which in this case will be
[22:34] printing money in terms of tax cuts but
[22:37] other ways that we're going through to
[22:39] offset the defl the deflationary
[22:41] deleveraging forces to bring nominal
[22:44] growth rate above the nominal interest
[22:46] rate so you're trying to bring down
[22:48] rates at the same time as keeping growth
[22:49] up there it's you got to do
[22:52] it without in getting inflation high and
[22:55] this is the the threading of the needle
[22:58] that is very very difficult it's one of
[23:00] the reasons why the currency devaluing
[23:02] at the same time that rates are going
[23:03] down is a positive but he says
[23:06] specifically you have to do this when
[23:08] the economy is good and the stock market
[23:10] going down is a very dangerous thing the
[23:12] stock market going down will hurt the
[23:14] revenue side but it will also hurt the
[23:17] real GDP side and this is why when you
[23:19] go through it they're trying to navigate
[23:21] this thing with a short sharp kind of
[23:24] trade negotiation side at the same time
[23:28] as getting their tax cuts through which
[23:30] is some of the stuff that went on with
[23:31] the shutdown uh and making sure that
[23:33] they get that in at the same time by
[23:35] July so that's why they don't want to
[23:37] bounce in the stock market at this point
[23:39] because it makes everything more
[23:40] difficult to negotiate with the rest of
[23:41] the world he actually wants things to be
[23:44] in a position where he can negotiate so
[23:47] I have full confidence that if we try to
[23:49] get this to 3% which is what their goal
[23:51] is the question is can it be done in one
[23:53] year uh no it can't be not in my opinion
[23:56] can it be done over the course of four
[23:58] years yeah but they have to get started
[24:00] and that's one of the things that Ray
[24:01] doio said is you have to get started on
[24:03] this immediately because it takes time
[24:05] to get this through and this is where
[24:08] the issue becomes as we've shown this
[24:09] before the debt is large and here's the
[24:11] problem when you have a deficit of 7%
[24:13] you're funding it with more debt and so
[24:16] at 7% of GDP you're running into this
[24:20] problem which is this year we have debt
[24:23] maturing or needing to be refinanced of
[24:26] $9.2 trillion you can see this out this
[24:29] outsized amount and this is because
[24:32] we're stuck in a situation where most of
[24:33] our debt is short-term so we have $9
[24:35] trillion which is equivalent to 33% of
[24:38] GDP plus the 7% deficit would mean
[24:42] basically we've got a huge huge problem
[24:45] a 40% of GDP of debt that we have to
[24:49] deal with so they are going to try to
[24:51] move levers they are going to try to
[24:53] renegotiate and get whatever they can
[24:55] out of this including Doge and if doge
[24:57] is 100 billion it all counts at this
[25:00] point they're trying everything they can
[25:02] to offset it and start going in the
[25:04] right direction and so I think you have
[25:06] to be cognizant that they can't have the
[25:08] equity Market go down a lot but these
[25:10] structural one-time issues they have to
[25:13] keep going and that's why they're going
[25:14] aggressively on the austerity side at
[25:18] the same time which again this is what
[25:20] Ray doio put out on the side of
[25:23] stimulating uh in terms of the approval
[25:25] ratings which makes it difficult uh
[25:27] these are they're all getting getting
[25:28] down there I mean this is a recent
[25:30] survey uh from us news and again on
[25:34] every single thing but you can see in
[25:35] particular the trade issues with Mexico
[25:37] and Canada are down here the trade issue
[25:39] with China is up here people don't have
[25:41] a problem with it immigration they're on
[25:43] the same page it's really mainly in this
[25:46] part and so that's why I think the trade
[25:47] side has gotten it's just it's become
[25:50] difficult uh okay they went through no
[25:53] shutdown if you go read the details as
[25:55] to why this has a lot of maneuvering but
[25:58] this is to avoid having uh the
[26:00] Republicans have free reign of closing
[26:02] agencies and doing stuff while the
[26:03] government is shut down it'll be easier
[26:05] for them to do stuff uh I thought this
[26:07] was interesting uh and I'll and I'll
[26:09] tell you why but uh lots of talk in
[26:11] Trump circles about the need for some
[26:12] grand plan to resolve the Tariff issues
[26:14] with Mexico can and Europe as a one
[26:17] universal settlement um now again he put
[26:22] this out at
[26:24] 6:15
[26:26] on uh Thursday
[26:29] and then
[26:31] only less than an hour later person
[26:33] close to Trump W house tells me the
[26:35] following unfortunately this is not
[26:36] being discussed at this time the one
[26:38] thing that is uh absolutely happening
[26:41] and Anthony Pompano and I talked that on
[26:42] our weekly this week is they are very
[26:45] coordinated at the white house right now
[26:47] they are negotiating things and
[26:49] everyone's on the same page which is you
[26:51] do not talk about the negotiations think
[26:53] about this is any sports negotiation
[26:56] that's going on between the team and
[26:57] talent they are trying to negotiate
[26:59] deals to get something over here in
[27:02] terms of investment to make the deficit
[27:04] situation get better uh and until that
[27:06] is done uh you're going to just continue
[27:08] to hear negative sentiment coming out
[27:10] and if anyone goes at them in terms of
[27:12] the countries you're going to see him
[27:13] respond the way he did with Europe this
[27:15] week the way he did with Canada last
[27:17] week I think that's going to be the plan
[27:18] uh one thing happening um Vietnam coming
[27:21] to the US and I think there's an offramp
[27:24] here and Vietnam is important because
[27:26] they are I believe the third biggest
[27:28] um net uh trade partner with us in terms
[27:32] of a deficit for us uh a lot of that is
[27:36] is China has moved things to Vietnam so
[27:39] I would just watch this because they
[27:40] have come to negotiate uh and that one
[27:43] has been a little bit more of what I
[27:46] would say as an off-ramp and then you
[27:48] had this come out after Europe basically
[27:51] spoke out Trump said he was going to go
[27:53] to 200% on alcohol and then all of a
[27:56] sudden Howard lutnick and this is from
[27:58] the ambassad from the uh the trade
[28:01] person in Europe or the Ambassador uh a
[28:06] lot of work ahead but let's stay focused
[28:07] and explore the best ways to move
[28:08] forward in the right direction so you
[28:11] immediately you get negative comments
[28:13] and I think everyone is realizing that
[28:15] this Administration is not going to back
[28:16] down and they want it to get to that
[28:18] point and so there's still anyone who's
[28:21] not who is uh is not backing
[28:23] down they're basically speaking out on a
[28:26] regular basis I mean it's hard not to
[28:28] see lutnick and bessin on TV every
[28:31] single day uh so this is just going to
[28:35] continue but I think we're getting
[28:36] clearer signs that they want to
[28:38] renegotiate this get the tariffs in a
[28:40] situation where they can get some money
[28:42] back from the private sector I do view
[28:44] this as a consumer um tax but since most
[28:47] of the spending in the US is from the
[28:50] higher end it is almost a a consumption
[28:53] tax uh so we'll see what negotiations
[28:55] come out but I do think they're trying
[28:57] to get the money from there
[28:58] this is the positive thing that's going
[29:00] on and I think this is very very
[29:01] important so uh I am doing a lot of deep
[29:04] uh research uh work for 22b this is the
[29:08] reason why I joined them uh for those of
[29:10] you interested in getting that I will be
[29:12] doing this on AI in particular right now
[29:14] it's focused on uh full self full
[29:17] self-driving uh AI agents and Robotics
[29:20] as the next phase and one of the things
[29:22] that's really important for that is
[29:23] memory chips so we're seeing Dam
[29:28] has finally start to make this fast move
[29:31] higher and this is really important cuz
[29:33] remember we started peaking in Nvidia
[29:36] kind of in here and this is when semi
[29:37] started to get weak so dram uh which was
[29:40] expected to go higher so the memory side
[29:42] was expected what hadn't gone higher yet
[29:44] was nand but now you've got Nan prices
[29:48] uh on this are starting to show up and
[29:50] they're talking specifically about these
[29:52] companies benefit the most Micron
[29:54] SanDisk Samsung and SK HX nark Market
[29:58] seems finally be seeing a turnaround
[29:59] according to commercial times and Tech
[30:01] news us memory makers like
[30:03] micr they are set to raise Nan prices
[30:06] over 10% beginning April 1 so this is
[30:10] important now you know how I love to
[30:12] look at markets um my favorite stock for
[30:14] this year is Micron in terms of the one
[30:16] that should benefit the most uh this is
[30:19] year-to date now so this is as uh for
[30:22] December 31 this is all these names that
[30:25] were just mentioned sandes Micron SK
[30:27] Hein and Samsung those are the four that
[30:29] were mentioned in that article they are
[30:31] all up year to date semiconductors this
[30:33] is a socks it's down 7% year to date
[30:36] through uh through Friday so Samsung is
[30:39] the least performer at two but you look
[30:41] at these you've got the other ones up at
[30:43] least 19 to 20 this is a growing story
[30:45] people um this is important for robotics
[30:48] this is inference this is everything on
[30:50] the AI side so anyone looking and
[30:52] forgetting that AI is not a bubble this
[30:54] continues to grow this chart is saying
[30:57] it and here is socks over the ndx so
[31:00] this is what you want to start to watch
[31:01] this is overlaid with those two charts
[31:03] so again Nan still here but they're
[31:06] talking about a 10% price increase which
[31:08] would only put you here but again this
[31:10] would be the first increase since
[31:13] basically the semi conductors have
[31:14] peaked so the semi peaked here Nan
[31:17] stopped going up here well now you've
[31:18] got Nan going up you've already got dram
[31:20] going up this looks like a really
[31:22] important story to me um this is the
[31:24] overlay of the socks with the Dan market
[31:26] so what I basically just showed so
[31:28] that's not the relative but the that was
[31:30] verse of socks you're oversold in the
[31:33] socks uh almost everyone I hear from a
[31:35] technical basis is super bearish on it
[31:37] uh semis are the Commodities they
[31:40] represent the AI future you want to
[31:42] follow what the charts are doing on the
[31:43] structural bull thing and right now the
[31:45] semis look like they're making a bottom
[31:47] here semis have not been part of 12 mon
[31:49] 12mon momentum so everyone calling up
[31:51] going this is going to be a reversal of
[31:53] 12 they're down over the last 12 months
[31:55] semis have not performed so they've been
[31:56] leaving GR ually the momentum trade the
[31:59] momentum trade has been more about the
[32:01] analytics the software companies things
[32:03] like that so I don't think this is a
[32:04] bounce in MO in terms of the importance
[32:07] of the semis if the white line is going
[32:08] to start going up well this is the mag 7
[32:10] which has taken us back to where we
[32:11] heard so all the outperformance that
[32:13] happened these guys are all resetting
[32:15] from a point which is very very similar
[32:17] so just keep that in mind and if you're
[32:19] looking for how Nvidia did last week
[32:22] well Nvidia has surpassed where it was
[32:24] after deep seek and then after the
[32:26] earnings when it collapsed we closed
[32:27] above both of those Panic prices I love
[32:30] seeing charts like that where you start
[32:32] seeing the move natural gas the power
[32:34] situation which I continue to say is
[32:36] going to be a major story in the second
[32:37] half of the Year despite everything
[32:39] happening in recession fears here's the
[32:40] 10th contract of Natty gas um looks
[32:43] fairly parabolic to me and if you don't
[32:45] want to look at Natty gas look at
[32:47] another place where power matters and
[32:48] that's copper this is the six-month
[32:50] contract of copper if we were in a
[32:52] recession Dr copper would go down
[32:54] absolutely would go down the a buildout
[32:56] is happening um that is a massive build
[32:59] it's a massive spend and we're at highs
[33:01] since you know we're making fouryear
[33:03] highs right now in uh in Copper so you
[33:06] have some Commodities going down on the
[33:08] energy side which is good in terms of
[33:10] oil and gas at the pump but then you
[33:13] have the other side um this is what I
[33:15] talked about in terms of the spending
[33:16] and this gets important uh remember if
[33:19] you're trying to cause a recession to
[33:21] get your balance sheet in check but at
[33:22] the same time you're saying you need to
[33:24] win the AI race with China well China's
[33:27] um spending more money so China
[33:29] continues to they're going to make an
[33:31] announcement on Monday the stocks were
[33:32] up big on Friday because they're going
[33:34] to be spending more money China orders
[33:36] major boost to defense
[33:39] spending China released a new AI uh
[33:42] agent tool this week uh which again is
[33:46] another one another expansion in terms
[33:48] of just showing how they've had a ton of
[33:51] these but there's no doubt right now
[33:52] that we are in a neck and neck race so
[33:54] you can't be putting the economy into a
[33:56] recession the same way China right now
[33:58] is trying to speed up their economy uh
[34:01] because we're in a trade war with the US
[34:03] and so they're boosting their
[34:04] development of AI this is what makes
[34:06] this whole thing ridiculous for people
[34:08] who think the government's going to put
[34:10] us into a recession uh that's not what's
[34:12] happening uh we need to get the deficit
[34:14] in check I'll say this again there is no
[34:16] recession coming in the United States
[34:18] who's winning the humanoid robot race
[34:19] well this is a big one too so this one
[34:21] is neck and neck uh every week there's
[34:24] more humanoid robot uh stories coming
[34:26] out this is on
[34:28] the US put out that they've got ones
[34:30] that lower unry had one you've got
[34:33] humanoid robots and again I put these
[34:35] out so you can go watch the videos too
[34:37] if you haven't watched the videos on
[34:38] them uh you really should to see the
[34:41] advancements and just where things stand
[34:43] this is real this is coming you cannot
[34:45] be bearish productivity and stocks three
[34:48] years from now uh so focus on the
[34:51] tariffs for right now but by the end of
[34:52] the year I think the S&P will be up on
[34:54] the year and I think it will be driven
[34:55] by a lot of the Euphoria that's coming
[34:57] on this the robotics story is real and
[34:59] again Robotics and all that fits into
[35:02] those charts I showed on Dam this is a
[35:04] very different stage this is not the llm
[35:07] stage this is the moving AI into
[35:10] Hardware stage which also is going to be
[35:12] on the phone in cars and in robots so
[35:15] you just have to get ready for the fact
[35:16] that this is a different part of the
[35:18] expansion uh I'm sure there's the vid
[35:20] the uh the uh abundance Summit was last
[35:23] week and I listen to this every single
[35:27] year my Fain thing but just remember
[35:30] this is what's happening in the world
[35:31] this is the story that's going on uh you
[35:35] can't get caught in the tariffs that is
[35:36] living in the 1800s I'm telling you it
[35:39] will only lose you money to sit there
[35:40] and worry about the tariffs and go
[35:42] through it that is not the end game the
[35:44] deficit is a problem but we are going to
[35:46] print money at the end because we're not
[35:48] going to be able to get the deficit
[35:49] completely in in check and so you're
[35:51] going to continue to have it when this
[35:53] turns Bitcoin will obviously be going
[35:55] higher but Bitcoin is being driven by
[35:57] two components they are not going to do
[35:58] as much as what they're saying so the
[36:00] recession is not going to happen whether
[36:01] we made a low on bitcoin or not we'll
[36:03] leave that in but I just want to remind
[36:04] you I am doing a weekly with uh with
[36:07] Anthony Pompano and again the reason for
[36:10] this is we both believe that the macro
[36:12] is now feeding into crypto if you do not
[36:15] focus on bitcoin being the number one AI
[36:18] trade at the end of the year you will be
[36:20] looking back realizing that it's really
[36:23] hard to invest in a large index of AI
[36:27] the last last few year last two years
[36:29] you've been able to invest in AI through
[36:30] the mag 7 which are Mega cap names at
[36:32] the end of this year the second biggest
[36:35] market cap in the world in my opinion
[36:36] will be Bitcoin bigger than all of the
[36:38] mag 7 and so that's what you're going to
[36:40] get into that's what I thought this was
[36:42] the year is about tune in to Pomp and I
[36:44] to go to to at least hear some of these
[36:46] things because he has got a lot of
[36:48] information on that side and I think we
[36:50] uh we compliment Each Other Well in
[36:52] terms of the macro uh I highlighted this
[36:54] last week the chart is starting to look
[36:56] better and better of course it's
[36:58] possible we can make another low down
[36:59] here it would take the equity Market to
[37:01] do that but since we have Nvidia going
[37:03] higher I would really pay attention to
[37:05] this pattern that has happened at all
[37:07] these levels remember to stick and just
[37:09] continue to be ready for when it turns
[37:12] here's the Nvidia chart with Bitcoin
[37:14] it's been related there's no way around
[37:16] it I don't think Nvidia can go up
[37:18] dramatically because I do think the
[37:20] valuation side will become an issue but
[37:21] I think Nvidia Still Remains a very very
[37:24] important stock and the one that will be
[37:26] most related to
[37:28] Bitcoin uh and I just wanted to
[37:31] highlight this to finish off every
[37:33] single person talking about micro
[37:35] strategy and how it's a bubble and all
[37:37] this stuff 23 returns 350% 24 returns
[37:42] for micro strategy
[37:43] 350% with the market down and collapse
[37:46] going on and Bitcoin down for the year
[37:48] micro strategy finished Friday up 2.7%
[37:51] year to date so go find your other
[37:53] bearish thing I'm a uh uh a buyer of
[37:55] micro strategy I believe believe it has
[37:58] a moat in the only moat that exists in
[38:00] the future of the digital economy I'll
[38:02] leave it there uh and I'll see you guys
[38:05] next week
