--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Uh historic week. Let's get right to it.
[00:03] Uh little little foggy over the East
[00:05] River right now. So uh deal with the uh
[00:08] the video of me. Uh we go from Black
[00:11] Monday to the best and pivot basis trade
[00:13] unwind. We've isolated China. We didn't
[00:16] have a stock put. Well, bond put equals
[00:18] stockp. Um em like asset moves during
[00:22] the week. Rev up the printing press.
[00:24] It's starting to be talked about. Uh it
[00:26] is definitely the end of the world as we
[00:27] know it. As we go through this bond v
[00:29] equals adapt or die as an investor. I'll
[00:32] go through what the consequences are
[00:34] regardless of what ends up happening
[00:36] from here. The world has changed
[00:38] forever. Uh and then I'll finish with uh
[00:41] AI Joseph Shumpeter and Bitcoin. Um
[00:46] first of all I wrote this on Substack.
[00:48] Uh, I put it out. Uh, I'm not going to
[00:50] go in detail to what a lot of the things
[00:52] say, but uh, I am sending stuff out
[00:55] during the week. I also sent this out
[00:56] through 22B on Monday or Tuesday. But
[00:59] the main point of what I was trying to
[01:00] get across, which I talked about briefly
[01:02] last week, it is always a mistake to
[01:04] listen to leaders at a time where they
[01:06] say they will not be doing something to
[01:08] help the market. Uh, and the point I
[01:11] made here is the
[01:12] market, every leader has always said in
[01:15] everything I've traded, the market's
[01:16] wrong with what it's doing. everything
[01:18] will be fine and not once has there been
[01:20] an exception and knowing that Scott
[01:22] Besson is there clearly that over the
[01:24] weekend based on everything that
[01:25] happened he highlighted this uh remember
[01:28] last week those final two days ranked as
[01:30] the fourth two-day decline in the S&P we
[01:32] went through that last week and in each
[01:34] of the prior instances the market was
[01:36] higher three to six months later so that
[01:39] was the beginning of the week so let's
[01:42] kind of go through a little bit of what
[01:43] happened this week first of all you have
[01:45] to remember there's no Trump put there's
[01:46] no Treasury secretary put, there's no
[01:48] PAL put, blah blah blah, as usual. Um,
[01:52] Monday, uh, China retaliates. Markets
[01:56] are looking for a crash. Jim Kramer says
[01:59] it'll be Black Monday. Uh, and that was
[02:02] probably enough along with a uh a fake
[02:06] news rumor about a 90-day pause, which
[02:08] clearly was an attempt of a trial
[02:11] balloon to see what the market would do.
[02:13] Uh but
[02:14] regardless, it was really the Tuesday
[02:17] night into Wednesday where something was
[02:20] broken and Jim Biano put this out early
[02:22] in the morning. Uh I re reposted it. uh
[02:26] whether or not this was the basis the
[02:28] basis trade that started it or whether
[02:30] this was foreigners bailing out
[02:32] regardless the main point I want to
[02:34] start with which I said on the podcast
[02:37] with Anthony Pompiano yesterday you have
[02:41] to understand that when the highest part
[02:44] of the capital structure in the world US
[02:46] treasuries are basically moving in the
[02:49] manner that they did where it was broken
[02:52] you were at a point where there's really
[02:54] a a you know a sign in the market that
[02:57] needs to be paid attention to. So just
[02:59] for a little bit of thing on the basis
[03:02] trade. It's a hedge fund trade. It's
[03:04] very important to the market or it has
[03:06] been since a combination of uh 2009 once
[03:09] the banks were regulated and their
[03:11] balance sheets were uh were shrunk. And
[03:14] at the same time uh 2020 and the reason
[03:16] 2020 was so important is because that is
[03:18] when we saw a massive expansion in
[03:20] government debt relative to private
[03:22] sector debt. Uh, and that just meant
[03:25] that you had this weird scenario where
[03:27] mutual funds would push up the futures
[03:28] above fair value. Hedge funds would come
[03:30] in, sell futures above fair value and
[03:32] buy cash bonds and levered up 50 to1.
[03:35] Um, so they've been providing liquidity,
[03:37] but really what they've been providing
[03:38] less so than just liquidity at the
[03:40] auctions is kind of this ability for the
[03:43] bid offer spread to remain tight. And
[03:45] that's why in the treasury thing, this
[03:47] is was talked about in terms of
[03:49] quantifying treasury cash futures basis
[03:50] trades. This is in 2024.
[03:53] Uh and this is coming out from the Fed
[03:56] supporting treasury market functioning
[03:57] by keeping the price of futures near
[03:59] fair value relative to treasury
[04:00] securities. Uh and this was a problem
[04:03] that the rapid unwinding of basis trades
[04:05] by hedge funds contribute to the
[04:06] treasury market stress in 2020. That's
[04:08] why that's where we are now. But the
[04:11] problem is this is not going away this
[04:12] time and I'll go through that. Investors
[04:14] fear another big blow up of basis trade
[04:16] as treasuries lose haven status. Then
[04:19] you get the next thing BV uh the Bank of
[04:21] England warns of further sharp
[04:24] corrections in markets is high. I highly
[04:27] recommend going through the Bank of
[04:28] England financial stability report which
[04:30] came out their minutes for the 4th and
[04:32] the 8th of April. They went through
[04:34] this. This is one of the snippets that
[04:36] was in there. Um hedge funds bought as
[04:38] much as $1 in capital for every 50.
[04:41] That's the 50 to1 leverage. Uh
[04:43] volatility in the treasury market can
[04:45] also increase the cost of trade killing
[04:46] its profitability. The the the main
[04:48] point here is um it's estimated that
[04:50] there was 800 billion to a trillion
[04:52] dollars of this trade on and that's out
[04:54] of the approximate 2 to2.5 trillion of
[04:57] lending from the prime brokers for the
[04:59] hedge fund. It's a big position. It
[05:01] added stability in terms of keeping
[05:04] volatility somewhat tighter but more
[05:06] importantly keeping liquidity in the
[05:07] market. Uh I don't think this will be
[05:09] coming back anytime soon for a variety
[05:11] of reasons for what I'm going to go
[05:12] through. So you have to put that into
[05:14] the context starting now of the top most
[05:18] important part of the capital structure
[05:20] of the world has lost liquidity and is
[05:22] going to have increased volatility going
[05:24] forward. So whatever you take from this
[05:26] whatever bullish side comes out of this
[05:28] because I'm going to talk about the left
[05:30] tail being eliminated at this point in
[05:32] my opinion. Whatever you come out of
[05:33] this, just remember coming out of this,
[05:35] the world will be completely different
[05:37] because the most important part of the
[05:39] global capital structure is not going to
[05:41] have the kind of liquidity and stability
[05:42] that it's had in the past. And this is
[05:43] what I wrote about. I'm I was more
[05:45] worried about a failed auction than I
[05:48] was about this tariff situation. Well,
[05:50] we had both of them this week. And
[05:52] that's why this thing ended up being a
[05:54] uh a turn in terms of the tariffs. So,
[05:57] Bank of England warns of tariffs, threat
[05:59] to stability, global financial system.
[06:01] That's the whole point here. And I'll go
[06:02] through the reasons why I've been
[06:04] steadfast on the fact that this would
[06:05] end the way that it has ended or at
[06:07] least has reached the next phase. It
[06:08] hasn't ended yet, but it has reached the
[06:10] next phase. So, of course, we get this.
[06:13] This is a great time to buy uh the next
[06:16] time he wants the market to rally 300
[06:18] points. If the market's down, what are
[06:21] you going to do when this post comes out
[06:22] that it's a great time to buy? You have
[06:24] to assume that this is going to happen
[06:26] later in the day. Uh Trump is hiking
[06:28] tariffs. This came out a couple hours
[06:30] after that went out. um authorizing the
[06:32] 90-day pause. So now we have a new put.
[06:35] It's just a post that says it's a great
[06:37] time to buy. Uh this goes through again
[06:41] Bessant and the pivot that happened. And
[06:43] for anyone who wants to read all of
[06:45] these papers now about figuring out
[06:47] what's going to happen, will there be a
[06:48] recession? Will there not? These have
[06:50] all been moronic. To sit there and write
[06:53] papers on forecasting when someone can
[06:55] change their mind overnight and get
[06:57] investors to freak out. This is what the
[06:59] papers do well. This is what strategists
[07:01] do. Well, the reality is this is a game
[07:03] of poker. You have to sit there and put
[07:05] the context of whether it's going to
[07:07] happen or not and then what the endgame
[07:09] is. And in the endame here, the whole
[07:10] system falls apart or the easiest thing
[07:12] is to debase and we've chosen to debase.
[07:15] So, Bessant advised him at Mara Lago
[07:19] over the weekend to promise an endgame
[07:21] and that's what happened this week.
[07:23] Nothing has changed. is there's going to
[07:25] be tariffs, but the global tariffs now
[07:27] are an all-around blockade on China.
[07:30] We'll see if that ends up being that
[07:32] way. There's going to be a lot of ups
[07:34] and downs in this negotiation, but I
[07:36] just want to make sure that you get that
[07:38] if you're following stuff like this
[07:39] Goldman Sachs resins recession forecast
[07:41] after just an
[07:43] hour. How do you make a forecast on a
[07:45] recession and then reverse it in an hour
[07:49] when there's new information when there
[07:50] had to be a probabilistic side of that
[07:52] happening? So, I don't understand this
[07:54] whole uh thing that the people follow on
[07:57] this. This is going to be this way for
[07:59] the rest of our lives. In my opinion,
[08:01] this is the new world. If you're going
[08:03] to put positions on and think that
[08:04] something isn't going to change within 3
[08:06] months, you're out of your mind. This is
[08:08] the world we're in for at least the next
[08:10] four years. And I would argue that
[08:11] there's irreparable damage done. And as
[08:13] I go through this, the world has just
[08:15] changed. And this is why by the end when
[08:17] you see gold going up the way it is and
[08:18] I give you some things to uh listen on
[08:21] podcasts and things to read about. We've
[08:23] been headed this path for a long time
[08:25] and this is not going away. We're just
[08:27] going to continue down this path but
[08:29] we're at the breaking point because debt
[08:30] to GDP is too large. So what was behind
[08:33] this? The bond
[08:35] market. Uh I don't think there needs to
[08:37] be anything more on it. So where are we
[08:38] in terms of the markets? Well the S&P
[08:40] futures got down exactly to the support
[08:43] that we went through last week. they
[08:45] were slightly above it somewhere down in
[08:47] the 4670 area to the 4,800 area. We kind
[08:50] of bottomed in that 4,800 point and then
[08:52] we rallied sharply. Uh I still think
[08:55] that that's what's going to end up
[08:56] holding. I showed this last week that
[08:58] aside from these two points which was
[09:00] pre printing press, we always got down
[09:03] to the 200 day moving average. The
[09:05] reason we would stop here is because
[09:06] every time we got here, Mario Draghy,
[09:08] every time we got here, QE, every time,
[09:10] every single time we went down to the
[09:11] 200week moving average, either the Fed
[09:14] andor the government would come in with
[09:16] something and it would change the entire
[09:17] marketplace. It has happened the entire
[09:19] time and you should expect it to
[09:20] continue to happen. The S&P finished
[09:23] 5.7%. It was the best weekly performance
[09:26] since
[09:28] 2023 on a daily move. We had one of the
[09:31] best four days in the last 75 years and
[09:35] that was after we had one of the worst
[09:37] weeks in the last 75 years. Uh so a huge
[09:41] day and here's what happens. Now if you
[09:44] remember last week I showed about three
[09:45] or four charts from Charlie Blo again
[09:47] emphasizing the same point that every
[09:49] time we get to this point if you can
[09:51] extend and not care about the next 5 to
[09:54] 10% down the upside is phenomenal
[09:57] because the government comes in. So
[09:59] unless you're playing for them to reset
[10:01] the entire globe and let everything
[10:03] reset at zero and start over again,
[10:06] which is not going to happen. That's
[10:07] what was attempted with the Great
[10:09] Depression. It didn't work out too well.
[10:10] That's why we have a printing press. So
[10:12] this is a rigged game. It is a Ponzi
[10:13] scheme. It is meant this way. This is
[10:15] the way it will always happen. It
[10:16] doesn't matter Democrat, Republican,
[10:18] China, US, everyone's in the same thing
[10:20] because this is the way it goes. It's
[10:22] much easier to debase your way out than
[10:24] it is to sit there and cause the pain
[10:26] and try to rebalance the economy in some
[10:28] foolish game. Uh it just won't work. And
[10:30] I'll go through the numbers why again.
[10:32] So SP was up 9 and a half% third biggest
[10:35] one-day gain since 1950. And here are
[10:37] the returns out five years. Here are the
[10:39] returns out three years. Here's the
[10:40] return out one year from that point. Uh
[10:43] if you add in this one, we had a huge
[10:46] breath day. In fact, advancing volume
[10:49] versus declining volume was a record 68,
[10:52] the most ever back to 1980. So, 45
[10:55] years, best uh day for advancing volume
[10:58] versus declining volume. 3 months out,
[11:01] all of them up. 6 months out, up big. 12
[11:04] months out, massive. Um I fully expect
[11:06] the exact same situation here in terms
[11:09] of 12 months out. I think it's
[11:10] impossible over the next three months to
[11:12] predict where we're going to be. I'll go
[11:13] through kind of what my viewpoint is on
[11:15] that. Uh, in terms of the monthly moves
[11:17] in the S&P, I just want to highlight to
[11:18] you that it feels like this has been the
[11:21] end of the world. But the reality is you
[11:22] can't even tell on a monthly performance
[11:26] basis that this stands out. You can tell
[11:28] this is a great financial crisis. You
[11:30] can tell this is COVID. You just can't
[11:33] see anything here. That's the crash. So
[11:35] monthly movements, we're not doing
[11:37] anything to destabilize. That's the
[11:39] important of it. I've said it before.
[11:41] Economies don't roll over because of a
[11:43] daily gain. Economies don't roll over
[11:44] because of a small move for a week. They
[11:47] run into problems because of things that
[11:49] last multiple multiple months, 18
[11:52] months, and that takes a credit on W.
[11:54] And we're not having that. Uh 30-year
[11:56] yields. So, here we go. 30-year yields
[11:59] back to 1985 for the week. Highest
[12:03] weekly
[12:04] move. Bond stabilization over in terms
[12:09] of Let me move this out of this one.
[12:12] This is the spread, the weekly uh move
[12:15] in the spread between US and German
[12:17] tenure
[12:18] yields. So, not only was it the biggest
[12:21] weekly move back to
[12:23] 1989, it's by a fac huge factor. We're
[12:27] talking about the one before it was less
[12:29] than 40 basis points. So, US yields
[12:32] widened out significantly. In fact, US
[12:34] tenure yields were at about 48 basis
[12:36] points while German buns uh uh tenure
[12:39] yields were flat for the week. Uh what
[12:42] also happened and what probably ended up
[12:45] being even a a bigger fear is it wasn't
[12:48] just the yields, it was this break that
[12:50] was happening. So this is the break in
[12:52] yields versus the dollar. So the dollar
[12:55] traded down the red line here and the
[12:57] blue line here is 10ear yields. So 10ear
[12:59] yields as they were going higher the
[13:01] dollar was falling. Uh this doesn't
[13:03] happen ever in the United States of
[13:06] America. It has happened occasionally.
[13:09] They mentioned in there that it happened
[13:11] in the UK. Uh I don't think of the UK in
[13:15] the US in terms of the size and the
[13:17] importance of the US from being at the
[13:18] top of the capital
[13:20] structure. The more important thing is
[13:22] as I mentioned in the piece that I wrote
[13:24] in Substack, my first seven years or six
[13:27] years of my career was trading emerging
[13:29] markets throughout the 90s. I saw that
[13:31] continuously when I was in Brazil. That
[13:33] was the way they ended. You had stocks
[13:34] going down, bonds going down, and the
[13:37] currency going down. At one point this
[13:38] month, Bessence's 333 plan had turned
[13:41] into the 555 plan because you had the
[13:44] dollar down 5%, you had bonds down 5%,
[13:47] and you had stocks down 5%. Uh, this was
[13:50] a total meltdown of everyone abandoning
[13:52] the United States of America. And you
[13:55] don't get a chance to kind of reboot
[13:57] that once it gets out of control. And
[13:58] that's why everything turned this week.
[14:00] Now, the dollar for the week had one of
[14:02] its worst weeks ever. I'll get back to
[14:04] that later in here versus Bitcoin, but
[14:06] it was down over two and a
[14:07] half%. Uh, this happened at the turn in
[14:11] 2022 when the Fed pivoted. This happened
[14:13] in March of 2020 and this happened in
[14:16] 2015 when oil was uh at first going
[14:19] down. Uh, the US to Switzerland had a
[14:23] huge move. So, people were buying Swiss
[14:26] Franks the same way they were buying
[14:27] gold. But Swiss Franks in particular had
[14:29] a has have had a huge monthly move now.
[14:32] So you've had people going in at the
[14:34] second fastest pace only the same as
[14:36] when people thought the world financial
[14:38] world was ending uh and they were
[14:39] bailing out of the
[14:41] US. Treasury bonds long seen as a
[14:43] risk-free asset are now seen much
[14:45] differently by investors. So as we get
[14:46] into the emerging market stuff yields
[14:49] higher currency lower common in EM saw
[14:51] this in the UK during the trust tobacco
[14:54] not normal in the US. America looks like
[14:56] an troubled emerging market economy.
[15:00] Fed's cash carry flags waning
[15:01] confidence. US no longer the most
[15:04] attractive to global capital. Now
[15:05] remember we were it was US
[15:08] exceptionalism in December and here we
[15:10] are less than four months later and
[15:12] we're saying now it's no longer the most
[15:14] attractive and it looks like an emerging
[15:15] market. Now, so you know, the reason
[15:18] when you when you decide to have a trade
[15:20] uh war, the reason you're at risk is
[15:22] because debt to GDP is at 120% and most
[15:27] of the debt that's expiring is in the
[15:28] front end. And foreigners own 19
[15:31] trillion in US equity, 7 trillion in
[15:33] treasuries, and 5 trillion in US credit.
[15:35] and the 5 trillion US credit which is
[15:37] approximately 30% of total corporate
[15:41] credit. The the the main point is as I
[15:44] said
[15:45] repeatedly just like Lehman Brothers
[15:48] politicians can let something go but
[15:50] then they're opening up a can of
[15:51] unintended consequences when they don't
[15:53] realize how connected the world is. This
[15:56] one just happens to be the most
[15:57] ridiculous to me because here is imports
[16:00] as a percent of GDP.
[16:03] So we're talking about3 to4 trillion
[16:06] dollars of imports that the US has as a
[16:09] percentage of GDP. It's exactly the same
[16:11] as it was basically when I was in Brazil
[16:13] in
[16:15] 1998. At the same time the stock market
[16:18] in
[16:19] 1998 was approximately at the mean of
[16:23] the last whatever which was about 80% of
[16:26] GDP and then it got up to 200% before
[16:29] the tariff started.
[16:31] Debt to GDP was down around 60. Now it's
[16:35] 120. We are a financialized economy.
[16:38] Imports have not changed. The size of
[16:41] the debt market and the size of the
[16:42] equity market have ballooned massively.
[16:46] You cannot put a trade war for few
[16:49] hundred billion dollars at the expense
[16:51] of losing trillions of dollars. This is
[16:54] a bad poker bet. This is the wrong way
[16:56] to go through things. That's why
[16:58] eventually when the negotiation reached
[17:01] a point where he could pull out, it's
[17:02] not surprising that he basically showed
[17:04] his cards and said, "Okay, we've made
[17:05] progress. Let's go through this." It's
[17:07] just a question of when the equity
[17:08] market went down. I think their
[17:10] intention was to keep going. The problem
[17:12] was if someone doesn't sit there and
[17:14] say, "The equity market is not going to
[17:16] handle this and the bond market's not
[17:17] going to handle it." Those are the
[17:19] unintended consequences that always come
[17:21] when you're living in a Ponzi scheme
[17:23] world, not just in the US, but all the
[17:26] way around the globe. debt to GDP is at
[17:28] ridiculously high levels and as Ray
[17:30] Dolly has talked about there's no way
[17:32] for this to end other than some kind of
[17:34] revolution. I'll get into that at the
[17:36] end because there is one happening. This
[17:38] will accelerate it. The big problem also
[17:41] when you have the size of the financial
[17:43] community that large you are dependent
[17:45] on liquidity. Equity market liquidity
[17:48] has sharply deteriorated in recent weeks
[17:50] contributing to the extreme volatility.
[17:52] bid ass spreads top of the book depth
[17:54] and liquidity ratio show a negative
[17:55] feedback loop for everyone managing a
[17:57] hedge fund out there going through this
[17:59] it's not coming back the liquidity is
[18:01] not coming back because we've lost the
[18:03] top part of the capital structure so
[18:06] unless all of a sudden the basis trades
[18:08] are going to lever back up again which I
[18:09] don't see happening for reasons that I
[18:11] will go through what the administration
[18:14] has done has changed the global trade
[18:16] system forever it has changed the flow
[18:18] of capital forever we are not looking at
[18:21] US treasuries as the safe haven asset
[18:23] anymore when bonds are when gold is
[18:25] going up and once Bitcoin starts going
[18:28] up again as the market has bottomed and
[18:30] you start going up. The problem is I
[18:31] expect there to be much more volatility
[18:34] and you're not going to see the VIX head
[18:36] back down to 20 anytime soon and it'll
[18:38] be because of bond volatility. Goldman
[18:40] top of book liquidity is now 2 million
[18:42] aside. This is in the S&P futures. You
[18:43] can see how low it is and you can see
[18:45] where we're at in terms of just the
[18:47] liquidity side. I don't see that
[18:48] changing at all. Now, the reason I can
[18:51] say this with kind of going through it
[18:52] and what we saw, remember I grew up in a
[18:55] world where
[18:56] Mexico was collapsing and eventually the
[18:59] US bailed out Mexico and to avoid the
[19:02] tequila crisis and they used some kind
[19:04] of special financial package to get that
[19:06] done. I remember when it was when it
[19:08] happened. Now, Mexico was still in chaos
[19:10] for a while because they had to pay off
[19:11] the debt. Then I was in Brazil. IMF
[19:13] package the IMF the US it's now for the
[19:16] US. So when you reach the point where
[19:18] the US has to bail the US out of the
[19:20] global system, that's when you're at a
[19:21] point where you can expect vol bond
[19:23] volatility to go on. Feds Colin on
[19:25] Friday, Fed absolutely ready to help
[19:27] stabilize the market if conditions
[19:29] become disorderly. The printing press
[19:31] has been turned on. It may not be used
[19:32] yet, but if we go down again, QT will be
[19:35] ended. There'll be other things that
[19:37] have gone. They will announce so many
[19:38] different things. It doesn't don't focus
[19:40] on rate cuts. Now that we know that
[19:42] Donald Trump will say it's a good time
[19:44] to buy, now that we know that the Fed is
[19:46] at least ready at this point, the left
[19:48] tail has been obliterated. We have taken
[19:50] it out. It's not that we can't go
[19:52] through the lows. I don't think we will.
[19:53] But if we did go through the lows, how
[19:55] long is it going to stay stay under
[19:57] there before the next thing happens?
[19:58] We've learned this with SVB. We've
[20:00] learned this with uh a pandemic. We've
[20:02] been able to stop every single one with
[20:03] liquidity facilities, and we'll be able
[20:05] to do this one as well. So, just be very
[20:07] careful in terms of people now saying
[20:09] sell all rallies. I think you want to be
[20:11] buying all dips because we will be
[20:13] through the all-time highs in a year. We
[20:16] might go through the the lows that we
[20:17] just had, but it won't stay there very
[20:19] long. So, you have to do this based on
[20:20] where you think the market's going to be
[20:22] over the course of the next year from
[20:23] this point. The economy is going to
[20:25] suffer in this quarter because of the
[20:27] tariffs, although we keep taking tariffs
[20:29] off. So, just be ready for anything to
[20:30] happen. Stocks rally as Fed signals
[20:32] readiness. So, the markets start
[20:34] starting to juice up where it's coming.
[20:36] Jamie Diamond sees Treasury market
[20:38] kurfuffle where Fed steps in. So,
[20:41] everyone who's bearish is going to say
[20:42] they're not going to be able to stop
[20:43] this. That's a bunch of crap. Um, if
[20:45] they want to stop it, they can. And I
[20:47] think they've made their point clear
[20:48] that they don't want bond yields to go
[20:50] higher. So, when every single person
[20:52] when I listen to the All-In podcast and
[20:53] the now uh proTrump All-In podcast by
[20:57] most of the people talking about how
[20:58] this is great, this is all good. This is
[21:01] BS. This is a Ponzi scheme, people. It
[21:04] is what it is. You just play the game.
[21:05] Your job is to make money. It's not to
[21:07] be right and it's certainly not to agree
[21:08] with the administration. They can do
[21:11] what they want and they are going to put
[21:12] tariffs on. There is going to be
[21:13] restructuring of global trade. That is
[21:15] going to happen. They are going to do
[21:16] some of the things that they wanted. But
[21:18] you have to uh advance to where the game
[21:20] is going to be played. More volatility,
[21:22] more volatility, more volatility. So,
[21:24] you got to focus on the things that are
[21:26] going to work no matter what. I expect
[21:28] that the tariffs will create some job
[21:31] losses, a lot of bankruptcies. I think a
[21:33] lot of small businesses that were
[21:35] already suffering from higher rates and
[21:37] from AI are going to suffer more from
[21:39] the tariffs. So I think you are going to
[21:41] see that but I also think robots and AI
[21:43] are coming to fill in the gap. Um and I
[21:45] just you know I want to make that point
[21:47] clear. So again this is a great time to
[21:49] buy. Look for this the next time. This
[21:52] was the dumbest thing possibly ever.
[21:53] Howard Lucknik says army of millions
[21:55] will build iPhones in the US. I like to
[21:58] to read what this to hear him say this
[22:01] on TV. I'm just grateful Scott Besson
[22:04] got involved. And here's this morning on
[22:06] Saturday. The US publishes reciprocal
[22:08] tariff exclusions for computers,
[22:10] smartphones, and and chipm. So on TV,
[22:13] last thing saying we're bringing
[22:14] everything back. We're going to have
[22:15] armies of millions building it. And then
[22:16] this this has nothing to do with what
[22:19] ended up happening. You can agree with
[22:21] the whole situation. Our job is to
[22:24] figure out what the market's going to
[22:25] do. And what they realized is they can't
[22:28] survive this whole tariff situation if
[22:31] yields are going to go higher when their
[22:32] goal was to get yields down. So we're
[22:35] way back up to the high end of yields
[22:37] for the last whatever 20 years, 15
[22:40] years. Uh yeah, 20 years. So it hasn't
[22:43] worked. So you got to pivot and give the
[22:45] administration credit that they did
[22:47] pivot this week at a time where they
[22:48] need to and that the negotiations are
[22:50] going to happen. Now Charles Gasparino
[22:53] uh highlighted the pressure that was
[22:54] coming. I wouldn't view this as
[22:55] pressure. I would just view this as you
[22:58] make a decision to do something to give
[23:00] them credit. They realize that maybe
[23:03] there were some unintended consequences
[23:05] that were happening that forces a 180.
[23:07] Um there's not going to be a quick
[23:09] solution to the trade war. I think
[23:11] damage has been done. Negotiations are
[23:13] going to happen and that's why, you
[23:15] know, the market is going to be caught
[23:16] in the back and forth still of news
[23:18] bombs. I don't see that changing and I
[23:20] think if the move new the news goes
[23:22] higher it means Trump can come out and
[23:24] be more negative. If the stock market
[23:26] goes back down and yields go back up he
[23:27] can be more positive. I think that's the
[23:29] game we're going to be in. So but I
[23:31] think people are going to get used to
[23:32] the fact that there is a put on the
[23:33] bottom and maybe there is a cap on the
[23:35] top and we kind of trade in a range for
[23:37] the next 3 to 6 months while the
[23:38] negotiations are going down. Um CEOs
[23:41] were speaking up. Uh they're open he's
[23:44] keeping it open door policy is listening
[23:46] their concerns on the tariff. There's
[23:48] plenty of room to negotiate with China.
[23:50] This is this is the way it's going to
[23:52] end. There's going to be a deal between
[23:53] China and the US. Who knows what it's
[23:55] going to end up being. It might take
[23:56] another two months, but it's coming. Um
[23:59] last week, you just go through
[24:00] everything, especially at the end of the
[24:02] week. We had more China retaliation on
[24:04] Friday, higher than expected inflation
[24:07] expectations, falling bonds, and somehow
[24:09] or another, the market was up again
[24:10] there. It's handling bad news. It's just
[24:13] making it through all this stuff. So,
[24:15] here we are now technically, and this is
[24:16] the way I think it's going to play. So
[24:18] the red line here is where I think for
[24:20] the next I'm going to say through Labor
[24:21] Day. That's going to be the high end. I
[24:24] think we're going to find support here.
[24:27] We could trade through this on the
[24:28] upside. We could trade through it on the
[24:30] downside, but I think for the most part
[24:31] it's going to be a whippy environment in
[24:33] here. Do not expect the VIX to come
[24:35] down. Um that's kind of my views on just
[24:39] what's happening. And remember, this is
[24:41] a massive title fight in a world of
[24:43] debt. So, we have the two biggest debt
[24:47] situations. And in China's case, if you
[24:49] add in the state uh debt as well, I
[24:53] don't care where you are right now,
[24:54] we're dealing with massive amounts of
[24:56] debt. And these are the two biggest debt
[24:58] players in the world. So, this is not
[25:00] going to go easily. Uh it's going to
[25:02] take some time. There's going to be back
[25:04] and forth. And that's why what you
[25:06] should leave with no matter what as
[25:08] someone looking to invest money is that
[25:10] the earthquake that happened it's
[25:12] reshaped the global economy. The world
[25:15] has changed and as uh as Kier Starmer uh
[25:19] in the UK said prime minister it's the
[25:21] end of the world as we know
[25:23] it and as you go through it it's
[25:27] basically there's no way around the fact
[25:30] that everything has changed. The end
[25:32] result is they're gonna spend more
[25:35] money. They're going to focus on putting
[25:37] figuring out how they can do things.
[25:39] Easing of
[25:40] regulations. This is going to change
[25:42] everything. And to me, it ends up with
[25:44] the same thing, which is now more
[25:46] printing um of some sort. People have to
[25:49] support their own countries. Uh two
[25:52] podcasts for you guys to listen to on
[25:53] someone who's been all over this. He's
[25:55] called it National Capitalism. This this
[25:58] one here uh was out in December. worth
[26:01] listening to just to hear Russell Napier
[26:04] is extremely good on history but in
[26:06] terms of everything that he said in
[26:08] terms of where it would go very very
[26:10] good in terms of forethought and then
[26:11] this came out on March 26th excellent 30
[26:14] minutes and he just goes through and
[26:16] everything he said on March 26 he said
[26:18] this will last until the bond market
[26:20] starts to become a problem he was
[26:22] exactly right once the bond market
[26:23] became a problem which he said would
[26:25] happen uh was an issue so there's two
[26:27] ways for the bond market to become an
[26:29] issue this was the good way. The good
[26:31] way is that there's deleveraging that's
[26:34] happening that it happens that leads to
[26:36] better tariff situations in terms of
[26:38] negotiations and it was only a week.
[26:41] Everything took a week for him to turn.
[26:43] So, in the end, I'd rather have that
[26:45] than a failed auction and us having to
[26:46] scramble to figure out the situation. Uh
[26:49] Pibble Malram had a great uh piece in
[26:53] Substack. Uh, and I just want to bring
[26:56] this up uh, in terms of reading it. As
[26:58] someone who spent family the last 40
[27:00] years negotiating the reduction of
[27:01] tariffs and non-tariff barriers trade,
[27:02] it's frankly astonishing to see how fast
[27:04] countries are willing to drop their
[27:05] tariffs to zero and that they're willing
[27:07] to work with the US even on non-tariff
[27:09] barriers. The reason this is so
[27:11] important and I and I really can't
[27:12] emphasize this enough. Everyone's in the
[27:14] same situation. The world number one is
[27:16] interdependent and number two, no one's
[27:18] in a good situation. No one's economy
[27:21] can handle the disruption. So, you're
[27:23] talking about a global recession. And I
[27:26] think the way Trump approached it,
[27:28] people believed he would take it all the
[27:29] way to the end. And so, I think there's
[27:31] going to be negotiations. There will be
[27:33] difficult ones because I think he's lost
[27:35] some of his leverage. But regardless,
[27:38] there is going to be trade negotiations
[27:40] that are going to happen. And I think
[27:41] it's cuz everyone realizes the point
[27:42] that he was trying to make, which is the
[27:45] system is archaic. It's from post World
[27:47] War II. It needs to change. I agreed it
[27:50] needs to change. There's no way for this
[27:51] to happen easily. So, as far as I'm
[27:53] concerned, we're getting to a better
[27:54] place with this. Uh, and so I'm glad
[27:56] that we've hit this point, but I think
[27:58] you guys should stop worrying about this
[27:59] as being a depression and how bad the
[28:02] economy is going to be. We might have
[28:03] two quarters of negative GDP. We have
[28:05] not seen any job losses yet. And even
[28:07] though I think there will be job losses,
[28:08] we're not talking about anything that is
[28:10] catastrophic. And the worst of the
[28:12] economy will be this quarter in my
[28:13] opinion.
[28:15] Um, magically it's been pointed out and
[28:18] whether this was intended or not, but uh
[28:21] it sounds like it could be a game. Now
[28:23] with the 90 days, the next big tariff
[28:26] announcement will be on the 4th of July.
[28:29] Uh, I'm betting Trump manages to drive
[28:31] stock prices through the roof just in
[28:33] time for the midterms. Uh, if you want
[28:35] to get paid in the markets, there must
[28:37] be risk. So, this to me is the key thing
[28:41] for you guys going in. There are always
[28:43] consequences to these decisions and
[28:45] Besson is going to get what he
[28:47] wants. If you want to get paid in the
[28:49] markets, there's now two-sided risk. You
[28:51] cannot just go in and buy it if you are
[28:54] trading. So for hedge funds and people
[28:55] that are managed on a month-to-month
[28:57] basis in terms of their P&L, get ready
[29:00] to trade. Don't look at your stuff and
[29:02] think, do you have any idea what's going
[29:03] to be happening six months from now in
[29:05] terms of how a company's going to do,
[29:07] what's going to go out? It just got more
[29:08] complicated. It was already complicated
[29:10] with competition from AI and a
[29:12] concentrated market. Now you're adding
[29:14] in the post tariff world where you don't
[29:16] know what's going to go on. So risk has
[29:19] been installed in the market. You're
[29:20] going to have higher uh bond bonds
[29:22] coming higher because the treasuries
[29:24] it's now apparent that how are we going
[29:26] to get to a point to restructure the
[29:28] debt outside of short-term thing? We are
[29:30] going to have issues constantly. Uh so
[29:34] you're going to get paid for managing
[29:35] the volatility. Returns will go up for
[29:38] those who have the skill to ride both
[29:39] the bull and the bear. Completely agree.
[29:41] For the young who have no memory of
[29:42] pregrand spin error, buckle up, take a
[29:44] deep breath, and enjoy the ride. This is
[29:46] when you learn. You don't learn anything
[29:48] when markets move smoothly and
[29:49] predictably rise. This is the kind of
[29:52] volatility used to be normal. When I
[29:53] started working on a trading floor in
[29:55] 1991, I joined Morgan Stanley at 1992. I
[29:57] traded emerging markets in there. I
[29:59] could not agree more with PIPA.
[30:01] Absolutely. And then finally, a
[30:03] shrinking US trade deficit will
[30:05] massively, not a little, massively
[30:07] disrupt the international capital
[30:08] market. Completely agree. So we're
[30:11] shrinking the US trade deficit. That is
[30:13] going to happen. That is the end result
[30:14] of this. So the collateral damage of
[30:16] doing this is it will disrupt the
[30:18] international capital market. Like I
[30:19] said, we're going to be in a situation
[30:21] where the top end of the capital
[30:22] structure is no longer the safe haven
[30:24] that it was. How will states refinance
[30:27] themselves when they need fresh dollar
[30:28] credit for debt servicing? We're heading
[30:30] into a time of extreme stress in the
[30:31] credit framework. One thing is clear. If
[30:33] the US manages to shrink its trade
[30:34] deficit, dollar credit will get pricier.
[30:38] Absolutely agree. And this is the way
[30:39] you'll see it. This is the move index
[30:41] which is bonval. So post 2020 when we
[30:44] issued all of this debt. We went up to
[30:47] higher levels. We gradually started to
[30:49] work down. It looked we were going to be
[30:50] there. This was the chat GPT
[30:53] benefit went right back up. Now here's
[30:56] where we finished last week. This is
[30:58] high yield to worst. You are going to
[31:02] see bankruptcies. You are going to see
[31:03] defaults. You are going to see people
[31:05] that no longer want to roll out their
[31:07] debt. Now, this is not a systemic issue.
[31:10] But bonv is going to be up here for the
[31:13] entire time. And if there was any chance
[31:15] that it was going down, which was the
[31:17] the hope when Trump took over, we've now
[31:19] taken it where I think you can just say
[31:21] it's going to be up here. Now, again,
[31:23] that means credit spreads are, you know,
[31:25] on yield to worse are going higher. It
[31:27] also means things like triple B's.
[31:28] They've been sitting down at low levels.
[31:30] I don't think they're going up here now,
[31:32] but I think you're going to see more and
[31:33] more problems of just default. So for
[31:35] people in credit, it's great to be in
[31:37] credit, but if bond is going to be
[31:39] higher, it's really hard to sit in there
[31:41] and, you know, and accept any lower
[31:43] yields. So the higher yields are going
[31:44] to be here. In terms of V, I don't think
[31:48] equity V is coming down either. So this
[31:50] is the six-month contract of the VIX.
[31:52] Not high enough for me. I think it
[31:54] should be up closer to 30. To get there,
[31:56] we're going to have to have a lot of
[31:58] realized V of 2% a day moves for the
[32:02] next couple months. I think we're going
[32:04] to see that. So, I think getting used to
[32:06] these, you know, 5% moves, I think you
[32:10] just have to accept that this is going
[32:11] to be a higher level. Again, liquidity
[32:13] has been destroyed. uncertainty is here
[32:16] for a while and we've completely changed
[32:18] the total capital structure in terms of
[32:21] what's there and the US doesn't have
[32:23] this bid underneath all the time from
[32:24] foreigners. So you're just going to have
[32:26] repatriation, you're going to have a
[32:28] change. So just accept the higher VS. It
[32:29] doesn't mean the market's going to go
[32:31] down. What it means is volatility is the
[32:34] negative side that comes out of this.
[32:35] They wanted to make sure that it was
[32:37] harder for Wall Street. I do believe
[32:39] between AI and higher bondvall as I go
[32:42] through the AI portion that is exactly
[32:44] what's happening. Wall Street will have
[32:47] trouble making the size of the returns
[32:48] it would. The sharp ratios will
[32:50] certainly go down. I don't see the S&P
[32:52] having moonshot moves and being able to
[32:54] expand multiples. So think about all the
[32:57] multiple expansion that happened the
[32:58] last two years. Best case scenario now
[33:01] is I see the way things move out of the
[33:02] course of a year is they're going to
[33:04] trade with earnings and profit margins.
[33:06] That's not the same as multiple
[33:07] expansion. Higher rates is one side, but
[33:10] higher bondvall and uncertainty makes
[33:12] long-term investors the whole thing
[33:14] changes. So, I think you have to be in a
[33:16] point where the value side, if you have
[33:18] a good business and it's trading below
[33:20] intrinsic value, you want to be involved
[33:21] in those things and that's where I think
[33:23] AI is going to help. I don't think you
[33:24] want to be in speculative things and the
[33:26] you're going to get killed every time
[33:28] you miss on forward guidance. So, be
[33:30] very careful with the investing side.
[33:32] Um, this is V for currencies. You're
[33:35] gonna have currency V that's higher. So
[33:36] this is the euro dollar cross. It it was
[33:41] sitting down here and it's up here. I
[33:43] think you're going to have higher
[33:43] currency vault. This makes it harder for
[33:46] historical correlations, any kind of
[33:47] quant back tests. Uh I think the world
[33:50] has changed forever and I think it's
[33:51] going to be very hard. The companies
[33:53] that should do well and the factors that
[33:55] should do well, it sure it should still
[33:57] be what it was. So this is uh the move
[34:00] index and the white line here is pure
[34:02] profitability which basically means
[34:04] businesses that are making money
[34:05] regardless of what's happen. It's not
[34:07] just safe businesses. So don't think of
[34:08] this as staples. These are good
[34:10] businesses. These are businesses that
[34:12] are going through. So I think we're
[34:12] going to stay in that environment for
[34:14] the foreseeable future. Um
[34:18] Nvidia, the AI trade is back, guys. I
[34:21] don't know what else to say. um as long
[34:23] as they're going to come through with
[34:24] the revenues and stuff, we have flushed
[34:26] everyone out of the AI trade. People
[34:28] have gotten bearish on it. It's going to
[34:30] happen. We are in the midst of the
[34:32] greatest technological revolution and
[34:34] the spending will happen and everything
[34:36] will go on because it's an important
[34:38] thing against China and there's
[34:39] absolutely no way that isn't going to
[34:41] happen. So Nvidia, believe it or not,
[34:43] this white line here is where it was at
[34:45] the lows on Deep Seek back in January.
[34:48] So basically, we're not too far away.
[34:51] We're $5 underneath. With all the
[34:53] bearishness that's gone and everything
[34:54] else, it's hung in there. So, that's the
[34:57] level that I think once we get above, I
[34:59] think that'll be a big time for the
[35:00] market, that'll probably mean the S&P is
[35:03] either at or getting above the 5700
[35:05] area. For those of you who have not
[35:07] reached out to 22V on the institutional
[35:09] side or anyone who you know wants to do
[35:12] business with them, um I did release a
[35:14] 16page deep my first deep research
[35:16] course on the next hardware investment
[35:18] frontier macro regime shift all on
[35:20] embodied AI. This is the stuff that now
[35:22] you want to be doing your homework on
[35:24] because AI is one of the things that is
[35:26] structural. It is one of the thing
[35:27] that's going to be happen. Here's what's
[35:29] happened this week. Google introduces
[35:31] Firebase Studio. Um this is all on the
[35:34] agent side guys. So everything you're
[35:35] going to see now from uh on this is on
[35:38] the agents uh new agent to agent or
[35:41] agent to agent protocol from Google.
[35:44] Remember agents is the big theme for
[35:46] this year. This is what makes adoption
[35:47] easier. This is what explodes stable
[35:50] coin transactions around the globe and
[35:53] leads to more and more of the digital
[35:54] economy growing. A AI agents is the most
[35:57] important thing for this year. Much more
[35:59] important than the robotic side. All of
[36:01] those things will just continue. But the
[36:03] AI agent side will allow for easier
[36:05] adoption than hoping that human beings
[36:07] will actually go out and learn how to
[36:08] use AI or learn how to use anything.
[36:10] That's already been proven to be
[36:11] challenging. The AI agent side much
[36:14] easier. MCP which I highlighted in here
[36:17] back in November. Um this is uh Demis is
[36:20] the head of uh of deep think for Google.
[36:26] MCP is good protocol. It's rapidly
[36:27] becoming open standard for the AI
[36:29] agentic area. We will be supporting it
[36:31] for our Gemini models. Very important
[36:35] terms of moving it out. People have
[36:38] Gemini. We'll go through this. This is
[36:40] again if you want to go read it on your
[36:41] own. This came out uh very powerful
[36:45] thing used in trading by a lot of places
[36:48] in terms of using different apps. Don't
[36:50] need API keys.
[36:53] Um this is kind of a a flow of it. I I
[36:56] just want to make sure you realize that
[36:57] on this AI side that regardless of what
[37:00] is happening in the market, this
[37:01] continues to move forward. People are
[37:03] not paying attention to what's happening
[37:04] in the stock market. So you've had a
[37:06] repricing of a lot of things. Go back
[37:08] and do your homework. I'm telling you,
[37:10] the left tail has been uh taken out by
[37:13] the administration. They've shown their
[37:14] hands. We may go back through the lows,
[37:16] but you can expect the Fed to be there.
[37:18] You can expect the administration to be
[37:20] there. And bond yields have shown that
[37:22] if equities are weak, bond yields are
[37:24] going to weaken. and this becomes an
[37:25] allout America uh problem. And so you're
[37:28] going to see the downside protected. So
[37:30] you should be going through the
[37:31] companies that are going to be able to
[37:33] grow and the fact that we're not going
[37:34] to have recession. That's what those two
[37:36] things mean. Left tail gone means no
[37:39] deep recession. Left tail gone means you
[37:42] can start to do your work on secular
[37:43] growers. Alibaba executives see
[37:45] explosive growth in AI applications.
[37:47] This is all out of China this week.
[37:49] Again, the AI arms race continues will
[37:51] not stop. Deep Seek unveils new AI
[37:54] reasoning method for its uh new uh new
[37:57] models. Uh Chinese AI meets quantum
[38:00] power and gets smarter
[38:02] faster. Do not doubt the government
[38:05] spending on AI. Uh EU now realizing that
[38:08] they've got to do everything on their
[38:10] own. Bets on gigafactories to catch up
[38:12] with US China in AI arms race. This is
[38:14] all this week guys during the during the
[38:16] pain. So now I'm going to finish up the
[38:18] last seven slides with something to just
[38:21] show you why I have so much confidence
[38:23] in where we at and how this all fits in
[38:25] with Bitcoin. So if you haven't heard me
[38:27] speak about this in public, if you
[38:29] haven't read or you don't know who
[38:30] Joseph Shumpeter is and his theory of
[38:33] creative destruction, I highly recommend
[38:35] going on your Chat GPT, taking a walk in
[38:37] a park and having a conversation with it
[38:40] on the book The Prophet of Innovation
[38:41] and learn as much as you can about
[38:43] Joseph Shumpert. I asked ChachiPT to
[38:45] give us a summary so I could go through
[38:47] this on here. Uh here's what creative
[38:49] destruction pressures governments and
[38:51] wealth distribution. As new technologies
[38:53] and business models emerge, entire
[38:54] industries are rendered obsolete. The
[38:56] winners of creative destruction, tech
[38:58] entrepreneurs, capitalists accumulate
[38:59] outsized wealth. Remind you of the
[39:01] situation we're in, the one being blamed
[39:03] right now on whatever trade deficits and
[39:05] stuff. This has all been about
[39:07] technology and this has all been about
[39:10] creative destruction. What does it do to
[39:12] policy from policy pressures from voder?
[39:14] The disruption creates polit political
[39:16] backlash. Populism protectionism and
[39:18] demands for redistribution increases.
[39:20] Citizens feel left behind by rapid
[39:22] economic change. Populism protection and
[39:24] the redistribution. Whether it's
[39:26] socialism, populism protection, all ends
[39:28] up in the same thing. When you have a
[39:29] distribution of wealth problem, which is
[39:31] caused by technology, governments face
[39:33] pressure to intervene with safety nets,
[39:35] regulations, or even anti-inovation
[39:38] policies. Middle class stability
[39:40] erodess. challenging governments to
[39:41] redefine their role in ensuring fairness
[39:43] and
[39:44] opportunity, further widening gaps
[39:47] between tech hubs and rural industrial
[39:49] regions, increasing geographic and
[39:51] political polarization. This is from a
[39:53] man who wrote this in the 1940s.
[39:58] Chumper argued that capitalism's success
[40:00] would eventually lead to its decline,
[40:01] not because of failure, but because
[40:03] prosperity breeds bureaucracy,
[40:05] complacency, and anti- capitalist
[40:07] sentiment, especially among
[40:09] intellectuals. He predicted capitalism
[40:11] might be replaced by socialism, not
[40:14] through revolution, but through gradual
[40:16] erosion of its cultural and political
[40:18] support. So then I said, "Hey, what you
[40:22] know about Bitcoin and the blockchain,
[40:24] how does that fit into Joseph
[40:27] Shumpert?" Well, it likes
[40:30] it. Uh, so the whole point of this is
[40:35] that if you ask a question and you go,
[40:36] "How does Bitcoin do in Joseph Shumper's
[40:38] world?" Oh, it's a rebellion against the
[40:40] bloated institutions that Shumper
[40:42] foresaw. The decentralized ethos of
[40:44] blockchain revives entrepreneurial
[40:46] energy. Shumper revered. It's a hedge
[40:49] against the erosion of faith in market
[40:52] systems. Chumper believed capitalism
[40:54] could collapse into a soft socialism.
[40:56] Socialism is not an option. Bitcoin is
[41:00] the
[41:01] option. So now let's go through the
[41:04] dollar as I highlighted before was down
[41:07] 2.77%.
[41:09] fourth
[41:11] worst daily
[41:14] move back in the last 15 years. So I
[41:19] only chose that to 2010 because Bitcoin
[41:21] started trading in 2010. So let's go
[41:24] back and look at the times where that
[41:26] happened those other times. First one
[41:29] 2015 may not be able to see it that
[41:31] clearly here. Oh right here at the lows
[41:33] on Bitcoin before Bitcoin started a
[41:35] massive rally over the next two and a
[41:37] half years.
[41:39] Uh the next one 2020 COVID we remember
[41:42] this one again another one dollar falls
[41:45] that goes on and then finally the last
[41:47] one was in 2022 FTX all the blah blah
[41:51] blah end of Bitcoin and then we get the
[41:52] next rally um it's starting again guys
[41:57] that we're we're going to make new highs
[41:58] in stocks this year or at least into the
[42:00] first quarter of next year. Nvidia is
[42:02] starting to trade well. Gold has already
[42:04] gone higher. People are looking for an
[42:06] alternative system. the digital economy
[42:08] and an alternative system will be what
[42:10] goes on. And more importantly, I've said
[42:11] this before, it's the network effects of
[42:14] stable coin and trades happening in the
[42:16] digital currency. You are not settling
[42:18] energy trades in gold. Venet confirms
[42:21] that China and Russia are settling
[42:22] energy trades in Bitcoin. Dolorization
[42:24] is here. Whether or not you believe this
[42:26] has happened or not, it's a matter of
[42:28] time. You're going to get outside the
[42:30] system to do this. OTC crypto and stable
[42:32] coin volumes doubled year-over-year in
[42:34] Trump's first 100 days.
[42:36] And
[42:37] finally, New York state bill proposes
[42:40] legalizing Bitcoin and crypto for state
[42:43] payments. That's in New York. Um, that's
[42:48] it for this week.
[42:50] Uh, I'm sure next week will feel like
[42:52] another month. See you guys next week.
