--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] and uh
[00:02] holiday week. Happy July 4th. Let's just
[00:05] get right into it. Um not a lot uh to go
[00:09] through this week, but uh definitely the
[00:12] stock market continues to surprise on
[00:15] the upside. Uh we've powered through the
[00:17] highs. Um I think I really thought we'd
[00:21] consolidate up here before we went
[00:22] through, but uh we've just powered
[00:25] through and continued at this point. And
[00:27] the chart again just looks fantastic.
[00:31] And uh the S&P
[00:34] strong breath makes a new high as well.
[00:38] Uh and again it after this fall here it
[00:41] went back through the highs. That's the
[00:43] NYSE breath. I've shown the S&P 500
[00:46] breath which was stronger for most of
[00:48] the time. So we're finally starting to
[00:49] see some of the small cap stocks head
[00:52] towards the highs. Uh it's not just in
[00:55] the US. of more than half of the world
[00:57] made new highs last week. Uh best
[01:00] reading in over a decade.
[01:03] Sentiment has finally gone back up. We
[01:06] now have uh uh starting to see some of
[01:09] the indices get to in this case the
[01:12] highest level in over a year.
[01:14] Uh AI most bullish since December 20 of
[01:18] this year. You've got uh high levels in
[01:21] the CNN fear and greed. RSI up SPX eight
[01:25] straight days of touching the upper
[01:27] Ballinger bands. Uh distance of S&P
[01:31] price relative to its 50-day moving
[01:33] average highest since 2023. So, it's
[01:36] been a strong market. Um and sentiment
[01:39] has obviously fallen has continued
[01:41] through. Now I want to shift into we're
[01:43] going to get into the earnings uh the in
[01:47] two weeks and I think this is the most
[01:49] important sector to watch. Uh we've had
[01:53] technology be a strong uh leader since
[01:56] 2022. Uh the mag 7 is underperformed
[01:59] this year as we've seen a broadening
[02:01] out. This is the agentic switch, the
[02:03] inference switch, the reasoning switch.
[02:06] you should start seeing AI adoption
[02:08] accelerate. And that means that we
[02:09] should start seeing profit margins
[02:12] expand in some of the other sectors,
[02:14] particularly with inside the S&P 500.
[02:16] And the one that I'm focused on right
[02:17] now is the BKX and the bank sector. Um,
[02:21] you've had a powerful move the last two
[02:23] days to at least get back through the
[02:24] highs of this year, but we still have
[02:26] not taken out the highs from 2021.
[02:29] Uh, and I think this is the most
[02:31] important thing to watch and obviously
[02:32] banks lead us off. Uh JP Morgan in
[02:36] particular is the one I'm going to be
[02:37] watching. I'm going to go through uh
[02:38] some of the reasons. It actually closed
[02:40] above its Ballinger band this week. So
[02:42] maybe maybe it gets a little bit of a
[02:44] correction after the earnings. But JP
[02:47] Morgan has been very public as I've
[02:48] shown in prior videos about being very
[02:51] focused on on AI. Um and in particular
[02:55] JP Morgan is telling its managers slow
[02:57] down on hiring, asking people to resist
[02:59] headcount growth where possible and
[03:01] increase their focus on efficiencies. At
[03:04] the same time, I also highlighted that
[03:06] $18 billion is their overall budget,
[03:11] which included an increase of 1 billion
[03:14] uh over the last year. Again, they
[03:17] continue to talk about headcount and how
[03:19] much it's grown recently and how much
[03:21] they want to focus on not hiring.
[03:23] There's another trigger, though. Um last
[03:26] year in September uh we talked about how
[03:30] if there are rate cuts and no recession
[03:33] it is extremely bullish for the market
[03:35] and in particular the sector that the
[03:38] sectors that tend to do the best which
[03:41] are out here. This is when there's no
[03:42] recession cut. This is when there is a
[03:44] recession cut um banks tend to do the
[03:48] best or at least the financials. And so
[03:51] we're sitting at a point where you're
[03:53] starting to get more and more talk about
[03:55] the rate cuts. And I think this is
[03:56] becoming a a more important theme going
[03:59] forward. Not just the fact that we're
[04:01] getting more commentary on the rate cut.
[04:03] Goldman Sachs talked about it this week.
[04:06] And the reason that they gave behind it
[04:09] uh now believe Trump's uh Trump tariff
[04:11] strategy may not have as large an impact
[04:13] on consumer price inflation. I
[04:15] highlighted that the CPI from that
[04:17] report is the mo the most recent report
[04:19] unless something changes dramatically.
[04:21] This is where the surprise is even for
[04:23] me is that we just have not seen the
[04:26] inflationary forces
[04:28] uh this year. Forget just the tariffs.
[04:31] Uh this isn't an indication to me that
[04:34] whether it's AI, whether it's the
[04:36] distribution of wealth problem in the
[04:37] country and the fact that people can't
[04:39] afford it, whether it's um Trump's
[04:41] pressure doesn't really matter to me.
[04:43] the inflationary statistics and the
[04:45] trend in inflation no matter how you
[04:47] look at it is very straightforward
[04:49] inflation hasn't come through on the
[04:51] higher side and now we're getting the
[04:53] extreme pressure so again you think
[04:55] about the banks you think about them
[04:57] benefiting from AI but the other part if
[04:59] we don't get a recession and we get rate
[05:01] cuts and it's likely or at least
[05:04] possible that we see a steepening the
[05:06] yield curve which is what we saw after
[05:08] September meaning cutting into nominal
[05:10] GDP around four to 5% %
[05:13] but we're still getting the pressure
[05:14] here. And in in the case of this Fed
[05:16] share should be investigated by
[05:17] Congress. Again, I've mentioned PY again
[05:20] on the Federal Housing side. There just
[05:23] seems to be some stuff that'll be coming
[05:25] out on this. This was a public side. The
[05:27] last time we saw something like this was
[05:29] on Liberation Day, but this is a piece
[05:32] of paper that goes through all the
[05:34] countries in the world and where their
[05:36] rates are and why the US is being slow
[05:39] to move rates lower. Uh so you've had
[05:41] now public pressure. This continues and
[05:45] at this point I think you have to be uh
[05:48] on top of the fact that it seems highly
[05:50] likely that this pressure is going to
[05:51] lead to lower rates. Uh and more
[05:54] importantly the question is how low will
[05:56] they go once he has chosen his own fed
[05:59] chair. So you are going to be making a
[06:01] bet on whether inflation is actually
[06:04] mean reverting back uh towards and then
[06:07] how low rates can go at a time when the
[06:09] government has chosen growth. We got the
[06:11] payroll numbers for this week. Um
[06:13] basically you know we created jobs but
[06:16] the weekly hours and the average hourly
[06:18] earnings uh ended up giving us an
[06:20] aggregate payroll number of zero. So
[06:22] again the payroll market is definitely
[06:26] on the softer side. Uh it's there
[06:28] there's no doubt about it. That being
[06:30] said, the threemonth average is still in
[06:33] nonrecessionary territory. We're still
[06:36] creating jobs. Uh and we're not seeing a
[06:40] dramatic drop off. The unemployment
[06:41] rate, which was expected to hit 43,
[06:46] came back down to 41. uh more and more
[06:48] people and more and more papers are
[06:49] coming out about the impact of the labor
[06:53] shortage uh immigration but also just
[06:55] the natural trend of demographics and
[06:57] how we definitely have a labor shortage
[06:59] and you could actually see no job
[07:01] creation and the unemployment rate not
[07:03] move and that's what we're seeing as of
[07:05] now. The one part that I think people
[07:07] I've shown this before I haven't shown
[07:09] it the last couple months but I think
[07:10] it's really important is the diffusion
[07:12] index. So this is the threemonth uh at
[07:16] 53%. So this is the uh percentage of
[07:19] industries that are increasing jobs. So
[07:22] out of the 140 some odd thousand that
[07:24] were created in the most recent month
[07:26] when you go back over the last three and
[07:28] let's say we've averaged you know
[07:29] somewhere around 130 to 150.
[07:33] We're getting a narrowing of how many
[07:35] places are creating jobs. So during the
[07:37] peak of rehiring postcoid we got up to
[07:39] 83% of industries. So very strong
[07:41] breath. Now we're at 53%.
[07:45] And if you take this to the sixmonth,
[07:48] uh we've had a big drop off. So we're
[07:50] now at 52% on the sixmonth. And every
[07:53] time since 1990 that we've been at this
[07:55] level, we've been in a recession
[07:57] already. So there's a lot of people out
[07:59] there that I think are focused on this.
[08:01] This is one of the reasons why as well.
[08:04] Even though the number was okay, we
[08:06] still have rate cuts built in because of
[08:08] the lower inflation side and the payroll
[08:10] side. So for September, we're at 74%
[08:14] chance now
[08:16] of a uh of a rate cut. Uh we were at 25%
[08:20] for July, but with the Friday reading,
[08:23] we went fell all the way back to 6%.
[08:26] Now, we had the big beautiful bill out
[08:29] and uh again, I I can't emphasize this
[08:33] enough. If you think about where we were
[08:34] even as people start to focus again on
[08:36] tariffs uh as we get to July 9th and
[08:39] some of the statements that Trump has
[08:41] made uh this is pretty we will make it
[08:45] all up 10 times with growth more than
[08:47] ever before. And that's why I really
[08:48] want you to focus on uh the trap that
[08:51] everyone fell for the first go around
[08:53] with tariffs which is uh they're focused
[08:56] on growth. It's the only way they can
[08:58] get out of this or at least attempt to
[09:00] get out of it which is why they want
[09:01] rate cuts as well. And I think that's
[09:03] where the focus has to be is that he is
[09:06] telling you he's going to focus on
[09:07] growth which is very different than the
[09:09] beginning of the year where pain must be
[09:11] had. They have to grow their way out of
[09:14] this. They'll get some revenue from from
[09:16] the tariffs but the focus at this point
[09:18] is to grow and of course that brought
[09:20] out Alon Musk. Uh if this insane
[09:23] spending bill passes the American party
[09:24] will be formed the next day. So Trump
[09:27] and Musk went out it again. uh threats
[09:31] of deportation,
[09:33] but the most important thing I think out
[09:35] of the bill that'll become a major story
[09:38] down the road is something we've talked
[09:39] about here in terms of power. So, uh
[09:42] there were parts and put in that are
[09:45] going to have an impact on the energy
[09:47] spending going forward and a Musk Musk
[09:50] came out and this is where he spent most
[09:52] of the time. This would be incredibly
[09:53] destructive to America. This is earlier
[09:55] in the week before the bill was passed.
[09:58] uh solar power in China will exceed all
[10:00] sources of electricity combined in the
[10:03] USA in three to four years. Just
[10:05] highlighting how important and Alon Mus
[10:08] has always believed that solar was the
[10:10] uh dominant part that should be focused
[10:13] on our biggest source of reliable power
[10:16] today is by is natural gas. Second
[10:18] biggest is nuclear and third biggest is
[10:20] coal. This is from Chris Wright.
[10:23] Everything else combined is like cavemen
[10:25] throwing little sticks into the fire
[10:27] compared to the sun. So Elon Musk was
[10:28] very specific this week in terms of
[10:31] what's going on and the focus has been
[10:33] uh it's a regulatory nightmare for
[10:36] energy projects.
[10:39] Uh so Mus says it gives out it gives
[10:43] handouts to industries of the past while
[10:45] severely damaging industries of the
[10:47] future. It's a strong progrowth bill.
[10:51] Taxing energy production is never good
[10:53] policy when oil or gas. In this case,
[10:56] renewables, electricity demand is set to
[10:58] see enormous growth and this tax will
[11:00] increase prices should it be removed. Uh
[11:05] this is where we are now. Uh you're
[11:07] going to start to really get into this
[11:09] in terms of the power side and the
[11:10] buildout side. uh when you get a bill of
[11:13] this size, there's going to be details
[11:15] that are missed in there and we'll see
[11:17] how this impacts the power. But as of
[11:19] right now, uh I would worry again even
[11:22] more so than the last month where we've
[11:24] talked about power based on the demand
[11:26] side, now we're getting into the
[11:27] buildout side, and I'll continue to say
[11:30] that if they're going to focus on fossil
[11:31] fuels at this point, uh the only
[11:34] companies in my opinion that are going
[11:35] to be able to be big enough to build
[11:36] this stuff for Chevron and Exxon. Uh
[11:39] Chris Camilillo earlier in the week uh
[11:42] and we've talked about this here how
[11:44] rare earth is the thing that ended the
[11:46] trade war with China. The US needs rare
[11:48] earth at any cost and I don't see China
[11:50] supplying enough without some softening
[11:52] on our chip export rules. One of the
[11:54] reasons why semis
[11:58] were a good place to be over the course
[11:59] of the last few months. Uh Besson says
[12:02] US hopes to see China magnets flow at
[12:04] faster rate. So again, China's using
[12:07] these
[12:08] as their negotiation tool. And then of
[12:11] course, what do we get uh later in the
[12:13] week? White House lifts chip design
[12:15] export ban in exchange for rare earth
[12:18] materials compromised. So that story is
[12:21] going to be there. I don't see it
[12:23] changing. Uh what is at an inflection
[12:26] point is commodities and it's not an oil
[12:30] thing.
[12:31] It is a power thing. But most
[12:33] importantly, uh, Colin Fenton put this
[12:35] out this week. I highly recommend going
[12:37] to spend time, uh, at 22V. Colin is
[12:41] great on this, but he highlights a bunch
[12:42] of things. These are all pieces that
[12:44] he's done this year, highlighting on the
[12:46] areas. So, instead of just focusing on
[12:48] oil, he's highlighting natural gas. The
[12:51] refiners have done extremely well. He's
[12:53] been all over that. You've got copper,
[12:54] which is breaking out. Silver, platinum,
[12:58] uh, and then he's done a lot on silver
[13:00] this year. It's just a very
[13:01] electrificationdriven
[13:03] world at this point. Uh Google made news
[13:06] this week. It's it signed deals to buy
[13:07] fusion energy from Bill Gates back
[13:09] nuclear startup. Fusion is becoming much
[13:11] closer. I'll get into some of that as I
[13:13] go through this. So this is this week's
[13:15] must listen to uh Venod Kosla who is a
[13:21] incredibly wellrespected VC person over
[13:23] the last 20 years in Silicon Valley
[13:26] co-founded Sun Micro Systemystems. Uh he
[13:29] gave a great interview. I've heard him
[13:31] speak before. This is in with or in on
[13:34] the uncapped podcast with Jack Alman,
[13:36] Sam Alman's brother. Venod goes through
[13:40] a bunch of things, but I'm going to
[13:42] break down and these are his visions of
[13:44] what's going to happen. He has had a
[13:46] very high track record of predictions.
[13:48] He was a very early investor into
[13:51] OpenAI.
[13:52] So for the next five years, this is
[13:54] where the stock market, it's very
[13:57] difficult to be shorting it. It's also
[13:59] one where you don't know what's going to
[14:01] happen to the the government uh in terms
[14:04] of the budget deficit. But this is the
[14:06] reason why people should focus on
[14:09] this being the next five years of
[14:12] massive productivity gains. Uh it may
[14:14] not show up in in the GDP number the way
[14:17] that people uh think, but it definitely
[14:19] will show up in the profit margins. I'll
[14:21] leave you guys to to read this, but
[14:23] that's the next five years. Then in the
[14:26] 2030s, uh it starts to become uh crazy
[14:30] for for companies. The rate of fortune
[14:33] 500 company collapse accelerates
[14:35] dramatically.
[14:37] Uh humanoid robots obviously begin to
[14:40] displace significant share of physical
[14:42] and service labor. Fusion again drug
[14:45] disco discovery accelerates. Uh again,
[14:48] the social contract begins to break
[14:50] down. society. Society struggles to
[14:52] realign labor, income, and meaning. Now,
[14:54] I've talked about this a lot. This is
[14:56] when he believes it's going to happen
[14:58] because at this point, we're going to be
[15:00] accelerating so fast. I believe the
[15:02] conversation and the fears are happening
[15:04] right now and will continue to be there
[15:06] as it's as the labor market is just
[15:08] harder and harder to find work. Then by
[15:11] 2040, the need to work is eliminated um
[15:14] and we get into abundance. The reason I
[15:16] want whether or not you have spent time
[15:18] on this, this is 15 years from now on
[15:21] someone who's had a very high and he's
[15:23] not the only one, you know, Alon Mus,
[15:25] Peter Diamandis, all people I respect
[15:27] are saying the same thing. If we're 15
[15:29] years away from that, the market starts
[15:31] discounting things and one of the things
[15:33] that it starts discounting right off the
[15:35] bat is the profit margin story and how
[15:37] long this is going to be. They might be
[15:38] wrong in terms of when this happens.
[15:40] Maybe it's60, maybe it's 2050. the
[15:42] government will have an impact on that.
[15:44] But the one thing is the profit margins
[15:46] will be accelerating over the course of
[15:48] the next five years which is why
[15:49] everyone who's focused on pees as the
[15:53] main benchmark for valuation is going to
[15:56] be suffering horrible pain. Uh you have
[15:58] to focus on the fact that these
[16:00] companies will continue to have profit
[16:01] margins and you should have pees at
[16:04] higher levels. uh we'll see if the
[16:06] revenue if if what I think is going to
[16:08] happen which he gets into here these
[16:11] 2030s will be a graveyard for the
[16:13] Fortune 500 at a minimum you want to
[16:15] spend time on this incumbents view AI as
[16:18] a tool for incremental efficiency
[16:21] existing companies are incapable of full
[16:23] reinvention this is a really critical
[16:24] part which he goes through and it's
[16:26] something I've talked about as well um
[16:28] he did highlight the robotics will have
[16:30] their chat GBT moment in the next two or
[16:33] three years that's going to be a
[16:34] critical part where I think speculation
[16:36] will take over in the marketplace as
[16:37] people envision what it means for that
[16:40] for having humanoids not just as a
[16:42] multi-t trillion dollar industry but
[16:44] also from again the profit margins for
[16:46] companies as it spreads. What I wanted
[16:48] to say is the Fortune 500s will be
[16:50] replaced by a AI native startups. He
[16:53] goes through the past patterns.
[16:55] If these companies, these AI native
[16:57] startups never go public, this is what I
[17:00] believe is that you'll have public
[17:02] companies replaced by private companies,
[17:05] most likely tokenized. Um, but I don't
[17:08] think they're ever going to be public
[17:10] companies. You have to think about that.
[17:12] And this will be a brain twister for
[17:14] people, but this is why you want to be
[17:16] moving money into crypto because if I'm
[17:19] right, the startups will be all invested
[17:23] through the crypto world. that will be
[17:25] tokenized, not the public market. This
[17:28] is what I've talked about that Michael
[17:29] Sailor is on. The change in capital
[17:32] structure from the digital economy, the
[17:34] fiat system, the public markets the way
[17:37] you know it, the bond markets the way
[17:39] you know it, they will change
[17:41] dramatically. And that is the one place
[17:42] that most futurists never talk about. I
[17:45] completely believe there will not the
[17:47] public markets as an investment will
[17:49] continue to go down because they will be
[17:50] underperforming the AI native startup.
[17:53] This is the first person I've say the
[17:55] destruction of the Fortune 500
[17:57] companies, the collapse of them. Spend
[17:59] some time on it. Um, here's one of the
[18:01] public companies now, Cursor. Uh,
[18:04] basically this week, I've talked about
[18:06] Cursor a bunch of times. It's now an app
[18:08] on the phone. Uh, this month they hit a
[18:12] valuation of 10 billion, soaring past
[18:15] 500 million ARR.
[18:18] Uh, Cursor is probably the fastest
[18:20] company ever to 500 million in revenue.
[18:23] You can see it took a little over two
[18:25] years. I first started using Cursor last
[18:29] summer.
[18:30] It was a very small company. There's
[18:34] other ones like it. Uh, but an app
[18:36] building code editor.
[18:39] Great great app to uh get your kids on
[18:41] as I wrote about in uh in my Substack
[18:44] this week. Uh, the fear factor for Meta
[18:48] continues to grow. I didn't talk about
[18:49] this story last week because I had too
[18:51] long of an episode, but here we go. Uh,
[18:54] they're making a super massive bet on
[18:55] super intelligence. You've probably
[18:57] heard the stories. Uh, he's done this
[19:01] before and been successful at times, not
[19:03] successful like the metaverse. Uh, but
[19:06] he is all out to try and stay relevant.
[19:09] Zuckerberg has grown frustr frustrated
[19:12] that rivals like OpenAI appear to be
[19:13] further ahead than Meta in the AI models
[19:16] and consumerf facing apps current and
[19:18] former Meta employees. So Apple has not
[19:20] made any big jump yet. There's been
[19:22] rumors. Meta is not waiting around. They
[19:24] just said we're not going to go buy
[19:25] someone. We are just going to hire as
[19:27] many talented people. Alexander Wang who
[19:30] was from Scale AI who they bought 49% of
[19:33] the company which basically means it was
[19:34] takeover to avoid going through the the
[19:37] regulatory process from from being able
[19:40] to do a merge but here are all the
[19:42] people the hundred million um crews. So
[19:44] he's paying billions of dollars for
[19:47] people to basically try and catch up.
[19:50] It's competitive catchup. Fear of
[19:53] obsolescence,
[19:55] talent and data acquisition. Meta's big
[19:57] bet on artificial super intelligence is
[20:00] fundamentally about survival and
[20:01] relevance in a rapidly evolving AI
[20:03] landscape. The company's leadership
[20:04] recognizes that failing to invest at
[20:06] this scale. Risk being left behind as AI
[20:09] reshapes the tech industry.
[20:12] The fear of obsolescence combined with
[20:14] the ambition to reclaim a leadership
[20:15] position as a driving force. This is
[20:17] important just to be on top of because
[20:19] it shows the competition and just how
[20:21] much money uh is at stake here for these
[20:24] bigger companies which again the mag 7
[20:27] has been underperforming this year. Not
[20:28] normal with the S&P at alltime highs. I
[20:31] want to go back to this again. Forcing
[20:33] the Fed public the last time we saw
[20:35] something this is just continues the
[20:38] side that he wants rates lower and he's
[20:40] going to continue to pressure
[20:43] the fact this is this is a focus um
[20:46] Trump investment team is preparing a
[20:48] year yield curve control regime without
[20:50] saying the words no coordination no
[20:52] inflation anchor just bill issuance and
[20:55] Fed pressure and threats to producers uh
[20:57] activist Treasury 2.0 know, leave the
[21:00] dangerous thing alone. The strategy
[21:02] under consideration, starve the long end
[21:04] of the treasury supply, flood the short
[21:05] end with tea bills, pressure the Fed to
[21:07] cut, yell at companies not to raise
[21:09] prices. Um, these are the things that
[21:11] are going on on what he wants to focus
[21:13] on. He's the president. Um, the
[21:16] president's demands to end Treasury
[21:17] coupon issuance until the Fed sharply
[21:19] lowers interest rates
[21:22] reminiscent of the worst EM regimes.
[21:28] All right, Bitcoin. That's where it all
[21:30] ends up. If you're going to have a uh a
[21:32] president that on the one side is trying
[21:35] to grow his way out by basically having
[21:37] nominal GDP higher than
[21:41] interest rates that we're paying uh to
[21:44] debase our way out or to reflate our way
[21:46] out, then Bitcoin, this is one of the
[21:49] reasons why it was uh created. It's one
[21:51] of the reasons why it should be going
[21:53] higher. I've highlighted this before.
[21:54] We've been consolidating. We got back up
[21:56] to 110,000 and then we pulled back
[21:58] again. We're through expiration. So, I
[22:01] do expect us to break out and start to
[22:03] move higher. Uh impulsive move here,
[22:06] impulsive move here, correction,
[22:08] impulsive move, correction. I think the
[22:11] breakout's coming, but from here, given
[22:14] that I am a believer in the network
[22:16] effects, uh we need to see a broadening
[22:19] out. The question has been for everyone,
[22:22] uh, what's going on with the selling? If
[22:25] we've got all this buying and we've got
[22:26] all the corporate strategy buying going
[22:28] on, we've got micro strategy buying
[22:30] every week, what's holding us in here?
[22:32] And there's a lot of conversations and
[22:34] since uh, this is getting published all
[22:36] the time. There's a great transfer
[22:38] that's going over in terms of the people
[22:41] that were initially in it that are
[22:44] selling to new buyers, whether it's
[22:46] retail through the ETF or whether it's
[22:48] the corporate strategy. We're getting a
[22:49] shift in ownership. Uh,
[22:53] uh, Renaissance Mack put out a Jeff
[22:55] Grass Group put out a
[22:59] a buy signal based on, uh, futures
[23:01] positionings in terms of, uh, large
[23:04] speculators being on the short side. Uh,
[23:07] this is where I think we need to again
[23:09] get the breakout. All coins, it's been a
[23:11] bare market in crypto. All coins have
[23:15] just been hurt. most of the so-called o
[23:18] old coins uh are nursing steep declines.
[23:21] So, we need to get a shift. And the
[23:24] biggest of uh the non bitcoin coins and
[23:27] the ones that I the one that I think
[23:29] needs to be going higher because of
[23:30] stable coins is Ethereum. I went through
[23:32] this last week. We briefly got back
[23:35] above the 200 day moving average and
[23:38] then fell right back below it. Uh I've
[23:41] said before I'm pomp, I'll continue to
[23:43] say it. I see a nice reverse head and
[23:44] shoulders here. I think we need to have
[23:46] two weekly closes above 2700 for a uh a
[23:51] breakout technically. That's what I'm
[23:52] looking for. This week, you did get at
[23:55] least one part. Tom Lee uh is joining
[23:58] Bit Moine. And whatever you think of Tom
[24:01] Lee, he has a voice. He's from the
[24:03] traditional finance world. He's been a
[24:05] big believer in Bitcoin, but now he's
[24:08] gotten involved in terms of trying to
[24:10] raise money and become the micro
[24:12] strategy of Ethereum.
[24:14] And I think more importantly than what
[24:17] he's doing is the reasons because we've
[24:19] talked about these stable coin growth.
[24:22] Uh majority of stable coins are built on
[24:25] Ethereum. This would drive a massive
[24:26] increase in network usage, institutional
[24:29] adoption
[24:30] because the traditional finance world is
[24:32] about to participate in the stable coin
[24:35] ecosystem including conversations of
[24:37] Walmart, Amazon. Uh the tokenization of
[24:40] real world assets is becoming a bigger
[24:42] thing. we had something with Robin Hood
[24:44] which I'll show basically all of these
[24:46] different reasons including contrarian
[24:48] opportunity are the reasons why he
[24:49] believes it's a good time to do this uh
[24:52] I happen to agree at this point um
[24:54] Ethereum is really important for the
[24:56] environment and the ecosystem with the
[24:58] stable coin bringing the network effects
[25:00] and everything happening volume side
[25:02] there Ethereum should be going Ethereum
[25:04] is powering Wall Street's future the
[25:05] crypto scene at cons shows how far it's
[25:08] come there was an event there uh that's
[25:10] where again Vlad Tennoff the co-founder
[25:14] of Robin Hood spoke about uh moving into
[25:17] RWA. So the tokenization of real world
[25:19] assets is coming soon.
[25:22] Ethereum hits 1.45 million daily
[25:24] transactions driven by layer 2
[25:26] solutions. Ethereum has reached a
[25:27] significant milestone with daily
[25:29] transactions marking the highest
[25:31] activity since 2021 and signaling
[25:33] renewed strength. I highlighted this in
[25:35] stable coins uh all of last year that
[25:38] despite the fact that we had had a bare
[25:39] market, they had gotten all-time highs.
[25:41] Uh I believe what is happening in
[25:43] Ethereum right now is the beginning of a
[25:45] breakout point for crypto that'll happen
[25:47] in July. I think July will be the
[25:49] trigger point for this stuff. Partly
[25:51] because we've come out of expiration
[25:54] these expiration quarterlys meaning
[25:56] March, June, September. Last year's big
[25:59] rally started right after September
[26:01] again when sentiment was really low. You
[26:03] have to start paying attention to the
[26:04] option market. I think there's a short
[26:06] squeeze coming. Um, if it is going to
[26:08] happen, I think it it should start in
[26:11] terms of getting through right after one
[26:12] of the prior expirations, getting away,
[26:14] and then causing some of the miners in
[26:18] particular. But I also think there's
[26:19] been a lot of u a lot of people that
[26:22] have been in crypto for a long time that
[26:24] have been shorting to collect income uh
[26:27] against their long positions. And I
[26:29] think there will be a squeeze coming up.
[26:31] Uh this is just the Ethereum spot flows
[26:34] we're starting to see after
[26:37] you know a bad period during the tariff
[26:39] side which took everything down. You've
[26:42] also got the future short position. So
[26:45] overall for uh Ethereum in my opinion
[26:48] we've seen now enough of a correction
[26:50] and I would expect that we're going to
[26:52] start to uh very soon here see the
[26:54] breakout. So watch 2700 for a weekly
[26:56] close above two weeks in a row. Crypto
[26:58] is not a threat to the dollar. You had
[27:00] Besson out again this week talking about
[27:02] it, but most importantly, digital assets
[27:04] are one of the most important phenomena
[27:05] in the world right now. Yet, they have
[27:06] been ignored by national governments for
[27:09] far too long.
[27:12] And then David Sax spoke, July will be a
[27:14] big month with a bill signing for genius
[27:17] and clarity going through the Senate.
[27:18] So, we're going to have the regul we're
[27:20] going to have the the um understanding
[27:23] now on the structure and we're going to
[27:25] have an understanding on the stable coin
[27:27] bill. So now we're going to have all of
[27:29] this going on which should move us to
[27:30] the next phase where Cynthia Lumus will
[27:32] try to move forward on some other items
[27:34] related to Bitcoin. Uh we we'll see what
[27:37] happens with strategic Bitcoin reserve
[27:40] the tax side in terms of transactions.
[27:43] Uh but in the meantime we'll just
[27:44] continue to move forward every week with
[27:46] Deutsche Bank aims to launch crypto
[27:48] custody service in 2026.
[27:51] Visa and Mastercard are racing to tame
[27:54] the 250 billion crypto threat. Tech
[27:57] firms and crypto startups are
[27:58] challenging Visa and Mastercard's
[28:00] dominance and digital payments with
[28:01] stable coins. They're responding again
[28:04] just like it is in AI where you've got
[28:06] meta spending money. What AI and crypto
[28:08] are doing is disrupting the capital
[28:11] structure of the existing framework as
[28:13] Venad Kosla talked about. I cannot
[28:16] emphasize enough to everyone who's an
[28:18] investor to pay more and more attention
[28:20] to what's happening as your last chance
[28:22] in kind of crypto as an outperformer uh
[28:25] at a time where it continues to do well.
[28:28] You have to think about the future and
[28:30] what it'll eventually mean for public
[28:32] companies if more and more and more of
[28:36] the business of the world is moving to
[28:38] AI agents and to crypto and stable
[28:41] coins.
[28:44] China competition. So, in the same way
[28:46] that China's trying to compete with AI
[28:49] uh and power,
[28:52] now we're getting more and more of this.
[28:54] There's more um there's there's more
[28:58] China talk about needing to compete with
[29:00] stable coins as the US dominates the
[29:01] stable coin market. And finally, Bolivia
[29:05] grip gripped by crypto fears 630%
[29:09] year-on-year surge. All right, holiday
[29:11] shorten week. Uh, enough news for there.
