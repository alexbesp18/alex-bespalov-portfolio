[00:00] I guess we've all been wondering when we
[00:01] were going to finally have something to
[00:03] talk about in the markets as I've done
[00:04] these for the last uh probably four
[00:07] months. It's been less and less of a
[00:09] market recap more and more about AI,
[00:11] Bitcoin, and just what I've been using
[00:12] AI for. So, we're back into the market,
[00:15] dominating the conversation. We're back
[00:16] in turbulence uh rare earth threat. I've
[00:20] me mentioned rare earth continuously
[00:21] since early April in these videos in
[00:24] terms of its importance. Well, now we're
[00:26] going to spend more time on it and know
[00:28] that it is critical for the AI buildout.
[00:30] So, for anyone sitting in AI trades,
[00:32] which we all are because anyone making
[00:34] money is involved in AI, uh the rare
[00:36] earth threat is a real threat and
[00:38] something that needs to be paid
[00:39] attention. The entire video will be on
[00:40] that along with uh the market structure
[00:44] showing stress before the event. The
[00:46] immune system of the market was very
[00:47] vulnerable to for something like this at
[00:49] this time of year. Uh a lot of times the
[00:51] immune system it doesn't matter. uh but
[00:54] if you get an event of this magnitude
[00:56] with stocks at all-time high and
[00:58] sentiment back up to the highs of the
[01:00] year and at the same time the underlying
[01:04] conditions within the factor world what
[01:06] I call the immune system showing
[01:08] weakness uh we'll go through that
[01:09] handicapping the risk going forward with
[01:11] China and the US whatever is going on do
[01:13] not lose focus on AI even if this is a
[01:16] onemon event and the stock market falls
[01:19] and I'll go through numbers it could
[01:20] fall a lot if this lasts for a month. Uh
[01:24] you still have to be doing your homework
[01:25] on this and paying attention to what's
[01:26] going on. I go through a lot of things.
[01:28] Uh there were a lot of important
[01:29] podcasts for the week and you're going
[01:31] to need some distraction because I think
[01:32] spending your time trying to handicap
[01:34] the uh the China US situation will be
[01:37] challenging on a day-to-day basis.
[01:38] Hopefully what I give you today will
[01:40] give you some framework to deal with and
[01:41] the debasement trade goes mainstream. So
[01:44] uh at the end of April I wrote this
[01:46] paper the light or not the end of April
[01:48] April 8th a couple days or a few two
[01:50] trading days after the uh liberation day
[01:53] collapse. I just wanted to write a paper
[01:56] that basically said that we had reached
[01:57] a level where the market had fallen
[01:59] enough sentiment had gotten bad enough
[02:01] uh and I think yesterday was a pivot day
[02:04] for the market at a time and a time for
[02:07] offense especially during the invitable
[02:09] retest. This was with just the horrible
[02:11] news that had gone or the the fact that
[02:14] people thought there'd be a complete
[02:15] collapse. Uh we're on the other side
[02:18] now. Uh it was only four months ago that
[02:20] investors were too optimistic. That was
[02:21] me writing this again back about what
[02:23] had happened in December. Uh for what
[02:26] it's worth, I believe the shakeup in
[02:27] global trade actually needed to happen.
[02:28] I prefer this to a failed auction in a
[02:30] 10-year worth 10ear rates. Absolutely
[02:32] still believe that way. I think the
[02:34] slowdown that occurred in the economy,
[02:35] the change that everyone getting out of
[02:37] this, the deficit in debt is not uh
[02:40] being viewed the same way it was before.
[02:41] That could change at some point, but it
[02:43] was important back then, but it did make
[02:45] people forget the acceleration of AI. Do
[02:47] not forget the acceleration. We're in a
[02:49] very different position when we were
[02:50] back then because every six months in AI
[02:52] is a link. Uh, and I'm going to go
[02:54] through through some things now that are
[02:56] going to get more into because the
[02:57] bubble talk still remains. So, people
[02:59] are still doubting it. And so you guys
[03:01] know, for whatever reason, I seem to be
[03:02] having problem with my video. Every now
[03:04] and then, it seems to be going blackout.
[03:05] Not really sure why. Not an expert in uh
[03:08] audio video on my Macintosh. So, I'll
[03:10] figure it out the next week we go
[03:12] through. Uh positioning dramatically
[03:13] different from how the year started in
[03:15] AI progress, making each month feel like
[03:17] a year. I'll bet this three-month
[03:19] sentiment shift will look very different
[03:21] by the time Labor Day ends the summer.
[03:23] So, here we are now. We're just past
[03:25] Labor Day. Sentiment did what I thought
[03:28] it would do. We were all the way down
[03:30] here at the beginning of April when I
[03:32] wrote this. We ended up up here, highest
[03:34] for the year as of this week. And
[03:37] Charlie
[03:40] McKelikott
[03:42] from Namora, who I love to read, don't
[03:45] get his stuff anymore, but uh we're in
[03:47] the 100th percentile of systematic
[03:49] flows. So you look at where we were back
[03:52] in April. Now you look at where we are
[03:54] actually the biggest percentile or the
[03:57] biggest C systematic flows in terms of
[03:59] longs and then you look at the equities
[04:02] we're at the 88th percentile in terms of
[04:07] the risk parity numbers and that's
[04:09] because we've seen V come down and we
[04:12] haven't had a correction. So basically
[04:14] this is a draw down for the S&P. We're
[04:16] coming out of this is obviously
[04:18] liberation day. Now, when you get out of
[04:20] this, um, and again, we hit a 20 plus
[04:22] percent correction back then. I'll go
[04:24] through how why this is important. Uh,
[04:26] we haven't had anything. When you
[04:27] haven't had anything for a long time,
[04:30] uh, you're due for something. We hadn't
[04:33] even had a 1% correction since August
[04:35] 1st. So, we did get that on Friday. Uh,
[04:38] China curbs rare earth. This was on
[04:41] Thursday. So, Thursday, this started.
[04:44] Market didn't care. It went to new
[04:45] all-time highs. But then just after Pomp
[04:48] and I finished the video, uh Trump
[04:51] threatens massive China tariffs because
[04:53] of the rare earth export. That a just
[04:56] shows how important they are. I'll go
[04:58] through some of the details on this uh
[05:01] later. Uh in terms of the importance of
[05:04] rare earth, is it possible to build out
[05:07] the data centers without rare earth? No,
[05:09] it is not currently feasible to build
[05:10] the scale of hypers scale or data
[05:12] centers plan. So rather than focus on
[05:14] the fact that you need them for the size
[05:17] we're talking about which is massive you
[05:19] cannot do anything close to it. They're
[05:20] also important in military which I went
[05:22] through last week. I'll go through that
[05:23] again. Uh Michael Hersan wrote a great
[05:26] piece. He's the only person I've really
[05:28] seen that has continued to warn uh about
[05:30] this moment during the entire time. Uh I
[05:33] had a very different view. I didn't
[05:34] think we were going to get to what
[05:36] happened on Friday. I still don't think
[05:38] it changes anything. But here's what
[05:39] Michael wrote, and he's the only person
[05:40] that I know that really was still
[05:42] calling for this, only three weeks ahead
[05:43] of the APEC. This is a very dangerous
[05:45] moment for global supply chains,
[05:47] including those powering AI. But it is
[05:48] important to note that neither side has
[05:50] yet implemented its threatened measures.
[05:52] There is still a window to back down,
[05:54] and Trump faces significant political
[05:55] risks if he follows through on the
[05:57] threats. He just did the Tik Tok deal
[05:59] which is what makes this a little bit
[06:01] you have to include that in kind of how
[06:03] could we do a Tik Tok deal with them
[06:05] less than a month ago uh where Trump and
[06:07] she agreed to it and then all of a
[06:09] sudden be at this moment. This doesn't
[06:11] sound like something someone as someone
[06:13] unfortunately has been through a
[06:14] divorce. Uh divorces take a long time to
[06:17] settle for reason and even in mediation
[06:20] there's a lot of back and forth. Someone
[06:21] will step away from the table. You go
[06:23] through this. I went through this. I saw
[06:24] it. So this is not surprising. I think
[06:26] the person to watch Scott Besson has
[06:29] been the person at all these moments
[06:30] including in April 9th or April 8th when
[06:34] I wrote the paper I mentioned that
[06:35] Bessant would have to take control and
[06:37] as you'll see later the area that Howard
[06:40] Lutnik is in charge of seemed to be the
[06:42] place that created the problem in the
[06:43] first place. Uh America's soybean
[06:45] farmers are panicking over the loss of
[06:47] Chinese buyers. The farming side is an
[06:50] issue also for Trump. Uh I wanted to do
[06:53] something with AI so I went and
[06:54] applauded. Um, they've had a big
[06:56] release. Uh, I wanted to see how I could
[06:58] build an app. Uh, for those of you
[07:01] who've known me a long time, I've always
[07:03] had a data scientist, even back in the
[07:05] days, back in in Brazil at Morgan
[07:07] Stanley, that person's job was to build
[07:09] things for me. I like to create things,
[07:10] but I didn't have coding skills. So, I
[07:12] would use someone who did have coding
[07:13] skills to build things. It may have been
[07:15] in C++ uh, back then, and now it's uh,
[07:19] you know, was most recently in R. Uh,
[07:21] but I asked Claude, "Are you able to
[07:23] build an app for me? I'd like to have a
[07:25] sigma
[07:27] uh a a sigma measure on a chart form
[07:31] without going through it. This is
[07:32] something I've asked for Bloomberg for a
[07:33] long time. And there it was. It took
[07:35] three minutes to build. And those three
[07:37] minutes ended up with this. This is a
[07:39] daily sigma move for the S&P using
[07:41] 20-day realized V. And the percentage
[07:43] move we had a 2.8% fall. Uh the V 20-day
[07:47] realized V for the S&P before yesterday
[07:49] was 6.4. So about 40 basis points a day.
[07:54] seven sigma move the biggest one we've
[07:56] seen in the last year. So Friday was a
[07:58] big move and again the reason I like to
[08:00] look at sigas is because it builds in
[08:02] part of that immune system side uh in
[08:05] terms of the warnings but only at the
[08:06] index level and the VIX level. There had
[08:08] been no volatility which again think of
[08:10] your immune system there hadn't been
[08:11] anything but under the hood there had
[08:12] been tremendous immune system issues.
[08:14] This was going to be the focal part of
[08:16] the beginning of this week's piece. Uh
[08:18] and really it was going to focus on
[08:19] Jared Kubin who's been putting this out
[08:21] all week. So these things were all
[08:23] before he's been highlighting what he's
[08:25] been calling liquidation nation which
[08:27] again is another way for saying there's
[08:28] been deleveraging that clearly is
[08:30] happening and it's been going on for the
[08:32] past five months but really stalled
[08:34] again in the summertime and then picked
[08:36] up pace usually deleveraging the main
[08:39] thing I want you to focus in here and he
[08:40] was showing this all day this was again
[08:42] on Friday or Thursday sorry in the
[08:44] morning the Goldman Sachs hedge fund
[08:47] index um and again I don't know which
[08:49] one he's using I use the long short side
[08:52] which I create myself. Uh again one more
[08:55] on this just different ways to look at
[08:57] it but the last three weeks acceleration
[09:00] is what really stood out to me and
[09:02] there's been carnage since the end of
[09:04] June but a lot of this is garbage things
[09:07] that have been moving higher.
[09:09] This is the way I measure it. So this is
[09:11] the Goldman Sachs crowded hedge fund
[09:13] longs overlaid with the most short pos
[09:15] the the hedge fund or the most shorted
[09:18] positions in the market. So you had the
[09:20] longs underperforming the shorts in
[09:22] here. That to me is very typical when
[09:23] you're coming out of something like uh
[09:25] like uh what we were going through
[09:27] liberation day and we kind of paused
[09:30] here midway through July started to go
[09:32] the other direction and then we
[09:33] violently fell down again even faster
[09:36] than we had fallen here. And this is the
[09:38] point that Jared was making and others
[09:40] were making that I was reading through
[09:42] all week and to me it stood out. This is
[09:44] a very very sharp fall and the line
[09:47] there is basically right around the
[09:48] midpoint of September. Uh in the V
[09:51] market, Goldman had been highlighting
[09:53] the fact that we had seen a zero
[09:54] correlation between the S&P index moves
[09:58] and the VIX moves. Just use one month
[10:01] implied V and just supp
[10:06] S&P index versus the VIX. Basically, we
[10:08] had gotten a zero correlation, which
[10:10] means that it if the S&P was up, you
[10:12] didn't know whether the S&P was going to
[10:14] the VIX was going to be up or down.
[10:15] Normally, when the S&P is up, say 50
[10:18] basis points, the VIX is down. We had
[10:20] lost that correlation. That's why you
[10:22] see that chart back there with negative
[10:23] correlations. Ben, don't know his right
[10:26] is the right way to pronounce his name,
[10:28] so I'll just say Ben from Wellington,
[10:30] uh, who I follow as well. Heard him on
[10:32] some podcast, has some interesting
[10:33] views, independent thinker. The two of
[10:35] these guys are I love independent
[10:37] thinkers. Don't care whether they're
[10:39] right or wrong. They're bringing their
[10:40] own views and they're bringing unique
[10:42] views and they're looking at things that
[10:44] are hard to find in the paper and
[10:45] they're hard to find in Bloomberg. And
[10:47] he was calling for the same thing and he
[10:48] had highlighted and it's hard to see
[10:50] here but he's highlighting warning
[10:52] signals for the S&P on the same thing
[10:55] between the correlation between the VIX
[10:56] and the S&P. So these guys were on it
[11:00] and again Goldman brought up the how
[11:02] many days in a row this happened last
[11:03] week. So the first one I showed you from
[11:05] Goldman was actually from September
[11:07] 29th. This is a redo from October 6 for
[11:10] the prior week. And in that case, you
[11:12] had five days in a row the S&P was up
[11:15] for 1.09% and the VIX was up 1.36 also
[11:20] notching five consecutive days. So you
[11:22] had the VIX up every day and you had the
[11:24] S&P up every day for 5 days. This had
[11:27] never happened before. These are the
[11:28] types of things that suggest that the
[11:30] immune system has weakened. Now, another
[11:33] thing that suggests that here's a
[11:34] differential between VA. I sent this out
[11:36] in the 22V chat that we have in
[11:39] Bloomberg just highlighting that I
[11:41] thought all of the immune system the
[11:43] market was weakening. I'm going to go
[11:44] through the reason the catalyst why as
[11:46] to what I think uh is also contributing.
[11:49] But the main point is here this is the
[11:51] VIX for the equity. It's VIX EQ for
[11:53] Bloomberg. You can see it right there
[11:55] overlaid with the VIX. We had been
[11:57] rising consistently in equity. So what
[12:00] was driving the VIX to go higher while
[12:02] the S&P V while the S&P was rallying is
[12:05] the fact that we were seeing a lot of
[12:06] vol in single names and so you had this
[12:09] break that was happening and the VIX was
[12:13] not moving yet to me again that is
[12:15] turbulence that is happening in the
[12:17] market and we're likely to see an
[12:18] increase in index volatility now
[12:20] tricolor's busted money machine Wall
[12:22] Street rethinking risk this happened
[12:25] around the exact same time as that arrow
[12:27] and that's the reason why I bring it up
[12:28] tricolor for which hasn't got the
[12:30] attention as first Brands had a sudden
[12:32] bankruptcy in September and again fraud.
[12:36] This is the unfortunately getting into
[12:39] first brands. Now an emergency court
[12:40] filing for an independent investigation
[12:42] into 2.3 billion tied to the company
[12:45] that had simply vanished. The collapse
[12:48] of First Brands has raised questions
[12:49] about the risk of private financing,
[12:52] private debt and private credit. those
[12:54] those two uh phrases uh have been a
[12:58] worried part of the market and in
[13:00] particular it's been for at least four
[13:03] years now that people have worried about
[13:05] this uh I would say it was actually you
[13:07] know before that uh the signs were there
[13:10] even in 2019 I would say that this was
[13:13] growing but it was really growing
[13:15] rapidly post 2020 and we obviously had
[13:18] COVID so there's been a lot of
[13:19] businesses that were hurt but then you
[13:21] add in the massive rate hikes that
[13:22] occurred uh in 2022 and I think people
[13:25] have been looking for the private debt
[13:27] market to possibly be a problem. The
[13:29] issue with this one is is it related to
[13:31] the K-shaped economy? Yes, first Brands
[13:34] is being linked in financial commentary
[13:36] symptoms of a K-shaped economy
[13:39] and that's because their customer base
[13:41] was predominantly lower income drivers
[13:42] who repair and maintain order vehicles.
[13:45] At the same time, when you go to the
[13:47] other side and you say Tricolor, well,
[13:50] they do a lot of lending to Subprime.
[13:52] So, this is kind of on the subprime, the
[13:54] bottom side. Uh, remember what Paul
[13:56] McCully said? I I always remember this
[13:58] back from 2008 when the housing market
[14:01] first saw the problems in the subprime.
[14:03] If you go look at that on the Big Short
[14:05] and watch the movie again, the plankton,
[14:07] as Paul McCully would say, uh, matter to
[14:10] the ecosystem. If you get rid of the
[14:12] plankton, then it starts to trickle up.
[14:14] I don't think we're going to run into
[14:15] that here. uh that is to me not not not
[14:18] necessarily important but you can't
[14:20] ignore it and say that it's not a a
[14:21] probability. So business development
[14:24] companies are generally seen as a proxy
[14:25] BDC's if you've heard that this week
[14:27] business development companies are
[14:29] generally seen as a proxy for the 1.7
[14:31] trillion private credit market and now
[14:33] their strugglers are indicating a
[14:35] weakening industry. Shares of many
[14:37] public funds BDC funds like Blackstone
[14:41] secured lending fund is down around 20%
[14:42] year to date. And then you've got the
[14:44] actual companies that are down too. So
[14:47] what does that look like? Well, here are
[14:49] the private equity companies related to
[14:52] the S&P and you can see how sharply they
[14:54] have fallen again in that same time
[14:57] period as when I showed the hedge funds.
[15:00] This is why when you start getting this,
[15:02] you start looking, you're like, okay,
[15:03] the private equity guys fell violently.
[15:05] This is a chart of the private six
[15:07] private equity companies public related
[15:09] uh relative to the S&P. That's what this
[15:11] priv spx is. Um you can see straight
[15:14] line down since
[15:16] uh since exactly at tricolor basically
[15:20] started and then followed by first
[15:21] brands. If you want to do your own on
[15:22] this here are the names. Apollo Aries
[15:26] uh Brook uh Brookline uh I think it's
[15:30] Brooklyn Brookfields uh Blackstone KKR
[15:33] and Owl. You can go through it on your
[15:35] own but those are the names basically
[15:36] that have been brought into the mix on
[15:38] on the side. Now there is a BDC in
[15:41] Bloomberg. There is a BDC index uh which
[15:44] has a bunch of funds in it and you can
[15:47] see how this has collapsed. So this is
[15:49] not a minor thing. I mean you're talking
[15:50] about something was at alltime highs in
[15:52] March bounce rallied back and now has
[15:54] fallen off violently again from kind of
[15:57] 64 all the way down to here. You've seen
[15:59] the Jeffre stock price come down as
[16:01] well. Uh if you do an overlay between
[16:04] those two, uh the public equity
[16:07] companies are the white line relative to
[16:09] the S&P
[16:11] and the other line is that index I just
[16:14] showed you, which is the BDC funds. So
[16:16] they've all been breaking down. This is
[16:18] their importance historically to junk.
[16:20] Every time we've seen junk spreads start
[16:22] to widen, we've seen the BDC's involved.
[16:24] Well, we finally saw junk spreads. This
[16:26] is junk spreads inverted. Uh they were
[16:28] weakening as well. had been down every
[16:31] day for the week or spreads had been
[16:33] wider every day for the week. They had
[16:34] been wider over the course of the last
[16:36] month again since September and this is
[16:39] the fall that ended up happening. So you
[16:42] end up in a situation where I wonder
[16:44] what junk spreads are going to do. Well,
[16:45] the VIX overlaid again with those and
[16:48] this is the reason why I was sending the
[16:49] stuff out. So you already had stuff
[16:51] going on the immune system with factors.
[16:53] You had stuff going on with dispersion
[16:55] in terms of single name options were
[16:57] showing volatility while the index was
[16:59] not. Looks like some hedge fund risk,
[17:02] maybe some deleveraging. The question is
[17:04] maybe there were hedge funds that were
[17:06] in the market of the credit side that
[17:09] ended up losing money with Tricolor and
[17:10] with First Brands and they had already
[17:12] had weakness going on in terms of their
[17:14] book in general and they wanted to take
[17:16] down leverage for whatever reason. And
[17:18] you end up in a scenario that eventually
[17:20] this starts to feed into the VIX. You
[17:22] add a little bit of a fire in terms of a
[17:24] match which was Trump on Friday and you
[17:27] can see where this would go. This is
[17:28] what I talked about exactly with Anthony
[17:30] Pompiano Friday morning. Uh it just so
[17:33] happens that this the Trump thing
[17:34] occurred Friday. If we would have done
[17:36] this video there, it would have looked a
[17:38] little bit different. But all the things
[17:39] I'm showing you right now, I only did
[17:41] them through October 9th. So these are
[17:43] not including the Trump stuff. Uh, one
[17:47] interesting component, no correlation
[17:48] with this one, but now all of a sudden
[17:51] violent correlation. Another sign to me,
[17:53] I look for things that are anomalies.
[17:55] Those usually mean something. So, what
[17:57] this is here again, this is the BDC
[18:00] stuff falling off the exact peak. Uh,
[18:03] here is that white line which is again
[18:05] right around early September and then
[18:07] the violent fall started at Tricolor.
[18:10] This orange line here is exactly
[18:14] the short side of the Goldman Sachs
[18:17] short basket relative to the S&P and
[18:20] again this is obviously inverted. So if
[18:23] you had a deleveraging scenario where a
[18:26] hedge fund had lost money on the credit
[18:28] side and they happened to have a quant
[18:29] book on the other side and they tried to
[18:31] get out of the stuff because this is
[18:32] very quanty to me in terms of this the
[18:34] the uh the orange line here. It would
[18:38] have been a short covering that was
[18:39] going on and you'd get a scenario like
[18:42] that. Now,
[18:44] in three lines, please summarize all the
[18:46] views on private equity in the all-in
[18:48] podcast this week. Private equity is
[18:50] totally baked. This is from the all-in
[18:52] podcast this week. This last Friday, so
[18:54] this is a week ago. Uh was this week
[18:58] view on private equity about how AI is
[19:01] disrupting capital markets? AI is
[19:03] rewrite is rewiring how capital flows,
[19:06] reducing dependence on traditional
[19:07] financing, weakening PE roles and
[19:09] forcing public markets to reinvent the
[19:12] next wave of growth. The other thing it
[19:13] is doing is destroying all companies in
[19:15] its path. I will continue to say this
[19:16] over and over again. We are going to see
[19:18] more bankruptcies. We are also going to
[19:19] see more business startups from young
[19:21] people. But we are going to see massive
[19:23] disruption from AI which are disrupting
[19:25] the business. And this is only going to
[19:27] accelerate if you don't have the money.
[19:30] meaning if you have too much debt,
[19:31] you're not going to be able to reinvent
[19:33] yourself. They go through this from the
[19:34] capital markets perspective. I'm going
[19:36] to keep saying this that we will see
[19:38] plenty of bankruptcies, plenty of
[19:39] issues. You want to invest in AI and you
[19:41] want to be short the stuff that is not
[19:43] going to do well and I'll go through
[19:44] some more of those. Now, the S&P for the
[19:46] week, h not that big of a week, down two
[19:48] and a half%. So, even with the Trump
[19:50] stuff, it's not like this isn't a move
[19:52] that happens regularly. In fact, we were
[19:55] up, you know, one and change percent
[19:57] three of the four weeks before. So,
[19:58] we're really not giving back much, I
[20:00] think, for the month. Down one and
[20:02] change. NASDAQ down 2%. Not a big deal.
[20:06] Uh, the MAG 7 down 2.7%. Not a big deal.
[20:10] SMH, Semiconductors, the AI trade, no,
[20:13] not a big deal, especially since it was
[20:14] up 5% the week before. Basically, it was
[20:16] down 3.3%. Three of the last four weeks
[20:18] were up more than that. So, you're up
[20:20] huge in September. We're giving back
[20:22] some of the gains at this point. The
[20:23] Russell 2000 down 3.2% for the week.
[20:26] Again, not a big deal. The retail
[20:29] favorite trade, retail favorites, they
[20:32] were hit hard. So, retail is finally
[20:34] being forced out. I would think that
[20:37] given I just don't see us going right
[20:40] back up to the highs that whether it's
[20:41] the retail favorites or this meme index,
[20:44] I think there'll be some more weakness
[20:45] in this just because I think there has
[20:47] to be an airing of this. So, on Friday
[20:49] late drops the 100% China tariff bomb,
[20:52] but Trump keeps door open to she
[20:55] meeting. This is from SCMP. So this is
[20:59] the Shanghai
[21:02] uh uh morning post. So you're at a
[21:07] position right now where the Chinese
[21:08] papers like all right he's saying this
[21:10] but it's not like like when Michael
[21:12] Herszan said that there can't be
[21:13] discussions. Um the S&P
[21:17] I wanted to just show this again the
[21:18] immune system side. Liberation day
[21:21] happens here. S&P had already fallen
[21:26] excuse me about sneeze 10%. Um we had
[21:29] already weakened the immune system
[21:31] completely. Uh but positioning was
[21:33] already significantly changed. The
[21:35] tariffs had been built in. There wasn't
[21:37] a lot on the books here. That was one of
[21:38] the reasons why I was more positive.
[21:40] this time you were at all-time highs
[21:42] just before Trump came out with that
[21:44] market didn't have any time to go. So I
[21:46] wouldn't underestimate that this if if
[21:48] we don't see a change quickly from this
[21:52] rhetoric. I think we're going to have to
[21:54] reposition things because we have a lot
[21:55] of MO investors that didn't have a
[21:57] chance to get out in a tape that still
[21:59] had strength. They've now have to deal
[22:01] with this. as a reminder, the MAG7
[22:04] relative to the S&P, not the MAG7 in an
[22:07] absolute basis. The MAG7 relative to the
[22:09] S&P and this is why I was saying I had
[22:11] started to warn in here early December.
[22:15] I have a YouTube video that says we're
[22:18] starting to see factor unr. I'd be
[22:21] careful of what's going on. Now, we had
[22:23] the deepseek moment somewhere in here.
[22:26] The MAG7 relative to the S&P was already
[22:29] significantly weak going into this,
[22:32] underperforming by 15%.
[22:35] Now, we've been weakening slightly, but
[22:37] nothing like what's been going on. So,
[22:40] I think you just have to again pay
[22:42] attention to the immune system. If I had
[22:43] to pick a spot, if the rhetoric keeps
[22:45] up, I would think that we would retrace
[22:47] all the way back to here. And I say this
[22:50] for a lot of reasons. I I'll I'll go
[22:52] through them, but I want you to remember
[22:54] here
[22:56] is April 9th. This is when Trump went
[23:00] out and said, "I'm putting a pause." But
[23:03] he was still isolating China in here.
[23:05] So, we were starting a retest, a violent
[23:07] one. During this period in here, rates
[23:09] were falling or rates were going up at
[23:11] the same time that stocks and the dollar
[23:13] was going down. So, we had stocks,
[23:14] bonds, and equities going down and we
[23:17] saw Trump flinch again. But in this case
[23:19] it was Bessant that at a dinner
[23:23] said uh there's room to negotiate with
[23:26] China that started the rally that was
[23:29] the low since that point we never took
[23:31] it out we never retested that is the
[23:33] point so if we are going to have a full
[23:35] round trip the whole reason to me that
[23:37] this thing happened was because this is
[23:40] the point that China said no rare earth
[23:43] here is where the US flinched. So in
[23:46] this case as to this this whole rally in
[23:49] my opinion has been related to the AI
[23:51] trade. There's no AI AI trade without
[23:54] rare earth. So rare earth is the
[23:56] critical component and I think that's
[23:57] where the negotiation is and I think
[23:59] that's where it's going to be. If we get
[24:01] an unwind it would be in my opinion
[24:03] because you've got a lot of funds that
[24:04] are trapped. So the first level would be
[24:06] this 66 sorry 6229
[24:09] which again is significantly lower than
[24:11] where we are. That would be another 3%
[24:13] at this point. And then the ultimate
[24:15] fall that I could see is back down uh to
[24:19] the 200 day moving average, which also
[24:21] happens to be this gap higher that
[24:23] occurred in June. So those would be the
[24:25] levels that I kind of think about uh as
[24:27] you're as you're handicapping this.
[24:29] Depending on how the rhetoric goes from
[24:30] here, it is all rhetoric. If they get an
[24:32] agreement, we're going to have a
[24:33] Vbottom. So you have to trade things
[24:35] accordingly. And that's why to me the
[24:36] VIX ends up being the thing. And if you
[24:38] were lucky enough to put VIX calls on,
[24:41] I'd be rolling them as we go. I don't
[24:43] know, every seven points, maybe eight
[24:45] points in in in the VIX. We've already
[24:47] gone up five, six points since the lows
[24:49] of uh of Friday and more since the lows
[24:52] of last week. Um based on this
[24:55] statement, options markets reflect. This
[24:56] is the thing I put out on VIX calls.
[24:58] This was two weeks ago. Why voliv calls,
[25:01] VIX calls, uh VIX convexity trades can
[25:04] work better in this and and this is an
[25:06] illustration of it. I don't think this
[25:07] is the last time. So, I would continue
[25:09] to focus on this. If you're a mutual
[25:11] fund or people, you have to build
[25:13] something into your process to where you
[25:15] don't have to sell out of things at the
[25:17] low and then turn around and buy them
[25:18] back. If you can't handle draw downs
[25:20] because you're measured on a quarterly
[25:22] basis, this has to be part of it because
[25:24] I think we're going to have these on a
[25:25] regular basis. In a concentrated market,
[25:28] especially one with Donald Trump as
[25:30] president and all the things that are
[25:31] happening, you have to expect that
[25:33] there's always going to be something
[25:34] that can happen. And if it happens at a
[25:35] time when the market's not ready for it,
[25:38] you're going to get these types of
[25:39] moves. I want to remind everyone, I
[25:40] showed this last week. If you haven't
[25:42] listened to it, go listen to it. This
[25:44] interview um with uh Andrew Roll's CEO
[25:48] is really important now for the things
[25:49] that I mentioned. Every US, China,
[25:52] Taiwan war game shows the US exhausting
[25:54] key munitions in six to eight days with
[25:56] two to three years to rebuild stocks.
[25:58] That's critically important because of
[26:01] the rare earth side. So some supply
[26:04] choke points are outside of defense
[26:06] demand. Rare earths, magn, these are all
[26:08] the things on the list with China. China
[26:11] specifically mentioned that on the US
[26:13] side, they think they're hurting us from
[26:15] a national security basis. They're
[26:17] focused on things like this which are
[26:19] for a national security basis. So the US
[26:23] edge is software. What did Trump
[26:24] announce? He's thinking of cutting off
[26:26] some software to China. So these guys
[26:29] covered it in there. This is why these
[26:30] podcasts I bring them up here because I
[26:32] think they're they're really good. Uh,
[26:34] and they're the way that I'm figuring
[26:36] things out. I don't show you guys the
[26:38] other 20 I listen to a week because most
[26:40] of them get thrown out because they're
[26:42] garbage and I don't make it through and
[26:43] I come in and I look at to see whether I
[26:45] should read them or not. Uh, for the
[26:46] size of the buildout plan by no rare
[26:49] earth. I showed you this before. Without
[26:51] rare earth, you can't do the buildup.
[26:53] So, what had gone on? Let's handicap
[26:55] this. Now, China hawks grow queasy over
[26:57] Trump's push for deals. Again, this was
[27:00] in the last six days. So, this occurred
[27:02] over the weekend. You started seeing
[27:03] that people were starting to worry that
[27:05] he was trying to make a deal. David Sax
[27:08] spoke about the criticism uh a day
[27:11] later, US must win this AI race. He also
[27:15] signals caution. We shouldn't sell our
[27:17] latest and greatest chips to China,
[27:18] which would give them an advantage. So
[27:21] if America AI stack captures 80% of
[27:23] global market shares and the US wins, if
[27:25] China gets there, the main point of all
[27:26] of this is that we had reached a point
[27:29] where this is not an easy divorce. They
[27:32] want stuff from us, we want stuff from
[27:35] them. It's very difficult and Trump is
[27:38] trying to thread the needle. I still
[27:40] believe he will get a deal done partly
[27:42] because of this. Trump says US and China
[27:44] approved Tik Tok deal. This happened
[27:46] September 19th. Now, why would the
[27:49] Chinese be mad enough to do Rare Earth?
[27:51] If you guys don't listen or I'm sorry,
[27:53] don't have the expost of Hugh Xiin, you
[27:57] should. He He put this out 17 hours.
[28:01] Well, this is from this morning. So,
[28:02] this was yesterday after the
[28:04] announcement. He has always been viewed
[28:07] as a voice piece for the CCP. So, if
[28:10] you're looking to see what the
[28:11] government is saying over there, at
[28:12] least in real time, it's not going to be
[28:14] President Xi. It's not going to be
[28:16] people inside the the uh Communist
[28:19] Party, but this person has been a good
[28:22] person to pay attention to to at least
[28:24] see what they're thinking. On September
[28:26] 9th, 29th, the US Department of
[28:28] Commerce,
[28:30] that's Lutnik's area, announced a new
[28:32] rule that expands its entity list export
[28:34] restrictions to sub uh subsidiaries at
[28:37] least 50% own. A move clearly aimed at
[28:40] Chinese companies. This was widely seen
[28:42] as Washington's attempt to create new
[28:44] leverage ahead of the next round of the
[28:45] China US talks. China also holds
[28:48] powerful leverage to counter them. Well,
[28:52] I guess rare earth is it now. That rule
[28:54] that was put in place on September 29th,
[28:57] this is a a labor a I'm sorry, a trade
[29:01] lawyer, global trade lawyer, Gibson
[29:03] Dunn, a watershed moment for export
[29:04] controls, the risk and complexities of
[29:06] the commerce department's affiliate
[29:09] rules. The amendment one of the furthest
[29:11] reaching changes to BIS regulations in
[29:13] years. So this was not a minor event. It
[29:15] did not get press but it was big. And
[29:18] again this is just highlighting this is
[29:19] a credible institution. Gibson Dunn is a
[29:21] powerful firm. This is on their website.
[29:23] So it's them you know some these guys
[29:25] are saying it but they put it in. But
[29:26] regardless this was being viewed that
[29:29] way. So let's compare that announcement
[29:32] to China's this week on rare earth. Are
[29:34] they similar? Both moves are strategic
[29:36] and timed ahead of a planned high level
[29:38] Trumpqi summit signaling escalation in
[29:41] their they employ the same logic
[29:44] weaponizing choke points and global
[29:46] supply. The two announcements are
[29:49] structurally similar in their strategic
[29:51] intent and mechanism control. So from
[29:53] when you read this from my side the
[29:55] Chinese responded in kind. Now poly
[29:58] market what is the probability of a US
[30:01] China tariff agreement by September
[30:03] 10th? It was up at 90 plus percent. It
[30:06] fell 270. It's back up to 80 after Trump
[30:09] did the 100%. So, I just wouldn't go too
[30:13] crazy on this. I still think a bargain's
[30:15] going to happen. If that does happen,
[30:16] you want to be doing your homework on
[30:18] wire. Now, I want to make sure we
[30:19] summarize at this point. The immune
[30:20] system, the market was weak going into
[30:22] this. This doesn't mean we're not going
[30:24] even though I still think there's going
[30:26] to be a China announcement. I think for
[30:28] the next couple weeks, we are in a back
[30:29] and forth market. I think you're going
[30:31] to have a chance to look for um for
[30:34] signs to get in. If you've had some
[30:35] names that you've been looking to buy
[30:37] that had run away from you, you might
[30:38] get a chance to buy them at levels that
[30:40] make more sense. I'm going to go through
[30:41] some of the AI stuff in here. Uh the
[30:44] main point is we are in a less certain
[30:47] period. Let's call it a mini version of
[30:49] what happened uh after uh liberation
[30:52] day. The lows could have been Friday. Uh
[30:55] I will see what happens when we get into
[30:57] next week, but I think you have to have
[30:58] more of a trading mindset. Uh, you know,
[31:01] as I told Anthony Pompiano when he asked
[31:03] how I deal with these types of things,
[31:04] when I trained or trained when I taught
[31:07] my son how to drive and I was giving him
[31:09] advice, I said, "Hey, you live in an
[31:10] area with a lot of deer at nighttime. If
[31:13] you're not paying extra attention and
[31:15] you're not slowing down, you're making a
[31:17] big mistake. You're more likely to hit a
[31:19] deer. You have to pay attention. It's
[31:20] the only way you're going to deal with
[31:21] it. You will run into one in the
[31:23] wintertime." That's the way I think the
[31:25] market's going to be. It's going to be
[31:26] less certain, which means it's dark.
[31:28] There's going to be deer running around,
[31:30] which is Trump's tweets. Uh, I think you
[31:32] just have to be more careful now as we
[31:34] fill this out. The AI trade will give
[31:36] you plenty of times to get involved. So,
[31:38] the the bubble talk, it was another week
[31:41] of bubble. I'm not going to show you all
[31:42] the stuff, but Wired had one on there in
[31:44] terms of our week, and then this was
[31:46] going around in this. So, again, I I
[31:49] think these memes are funny. Every
[31:50] person who is bearish sent this out
[31:53] saying, "Yeah, this is a clear sign of a
[31:54] bubble. Just stop, guys." Um, all right.
[31:57] the must listen to. So Dylan Patel is
[32:01] the only person and I'm going to say
[32:03] this because I've had lots of of hedge
[32:05] funds talk about Goldman Sachs people
[32:08] and Morgan Stanley people. No offense to
[32:10] the places that I grew up at. Zero
[32:12] chance that they have anything over
[32:14] Dylan Patel. This guy lives only on the
[32:18] entire supply chain and everything going
[32:20] on. And he does plenty of interviews. He
[32:23] has a reasonably priced subscription for
[32:26] semi analysis. This is the only person
[32:28] in my opinion to listen to for the
[32:30] supply chain and where we stand. He
[32:32] understands the compute side. He
[32:34] understands the power side. He
[32:37] understands the model side. So, he is
[32:39] heavily respected. However, he got to
[32:41] this level. I love listening to him. He
[32:43] did an interview with A16Z
[32:46] uh recently. I think that was earlier in
[32:49] the week. Maybe it was last week. Uh,
[32:51] and then he did this one which was with
[32:54] Patrick Oshanosy, Invest Like the Best.
[32:57] Phenomenal interview. Everything you
[32:59] need to see. If you're going to listen
[33:00] to one thing this week, listen to this.
[33:03] Uh, I'll just give you some of the
[33:04] highlights.
[33:06] Dylan begins the interview by framing
[33:07] the I build out as the highest stakes
[33:09] capitalism game of all time. I actually
[33:11] think they're wrong on this. I think
[33:12] that's what Patrick Oshanesy called it,
[33:14] but regardless, it's in the interview
[33:16] that way and I agree with it. This is
[33:17] the highest stakes capitalism game of
[33:19] all time. That's why people can be
[33:21] bearish. They can sit there and say this
[33:22] is a bubble because we've never spent
[33:24] this kind of money. Now, he stresses
[33:26] that AI's economics are inverted
[33:28] relative to traditional technology
[33:29] cycles. I've talked about this. I've
[33:31] written about it. I wrote about it this
[33:32] week. In a normal market, you first
[33:35] build a product that finds customers,
[33:36] then you scale the infrastructure to
[33:38] meet the demand. This is in reverse. We
[33:40] need massive clusters ahead of the
[33:42] products. And the reason is, as I get
[33:44] in, they can't actually release the
[33:47] models. So the models you're using are
[33:49] not the models, guys. Hate to tell you
[33:50] this. Not sure if you understand it. You
[33:53] don't have the real model. I'll get into
[33:54] that. But the ability of releasing, you
[33:57] can't use the videos you want to use.
[33:58] You can't do anything. So for anyone to
[34:00] say this is a bubble, we don't have
[34:01] enough infrastructure for even the AI we
[34:04] have today. The models we've released
[34:06] today, we don't have enough. The models
[34:08] they have behind the scenes, who knows
[34:11] how much extra billions of compute they
[34:13] need, but it is in making it. they have
[34:16] no ability to release what they want to
[34:18] release or they'd already have the
[34:19] revenues coming in. And oh, by the way,
[34:20] Oracle's RPOS's are revenues. Regardless
[34:22] of what everyone says and everyone goes
[34:24] through, they might actually be getting
[34:26] the money, but as I've said on
[34:28] interviews and as I've said it in public
[34:30] and as I've gone through it, if you have
[34:31] a restaurant and someone orders a
[34:33] billion cheeseburgers, you're not going
[34:34] to be able to make them. That doesn't
[34:35] mean you didn't get the order in. It's
[34:37] an RPO. It is something that people
[34:39] want. So, unless the models slow back,
[34:41] it's a problem. And that's what he says.
[34:42] models. Patel's warning is stark. If the
[34:46] compounding slows, the feedback loop
[34:48] snaps. Now, this is what people have
[34:50] gone on. So, this is why I'm showing you
[34:52] things to go through it. He says that's
[34:55] not happening. Everything that he sees
[34:57] on there is that the models are ahead.
[34:59] The same thing I'm seeing and as I'm
[35:01] going to go through this, he's involved
[35:02] with every company in terms of talking
[35:04] to them. So
[35:07] the highest stakes capital this is why
[35:08] Patel calls it a capitalism endgame
[35:10] scenario which I've called it too. Um
[35:13] the belief in infinite improvement
[35:14] sustains equity valuations credit
[35:16] national industrial policy chips. AI
[35:19] progress isn't just a technological
[35:20] race. It's a macroeconomic necessity.
[35:23] Again there's no way to go backwards.
[35:26] This has to be spent from a government
[35:27] level and from these guys. And they're
[35:29] spending this. If it wasn't for them we
[35:32] wouldn't be able to do it. Meaning if
[35:33] they didn't have the concentration and
[35:35] the size that they are, they wouldn't be
[35:36] able to do this. They wouldn't be able
[35:37] to get the AI to where it is. The fact
[35:40] that they have the money and have the
[35:41] ability of raising the money because
[35:42] their equity is so massive allows them
[35:45] to do this. Open AAI is a different
[35:47] situation. They don't have the equity to
[35:49] do it. They don't have the revenues to
[35:50] do it. They don't have the free cash
[35:51] flow. So, they're the ones that people
[35:53] pick on, but you're dealing with massive
[35:55] companies with massive valuation. So,
[35:57] his framework, wave one, language and
[36:00] cognition. This is the LLMs. Wave two,
[36:03] power and materials. This is where we
[36:04] are. We need all of this stuff. This is
[36:06] where we are right now. This is the
[36:07] investment side. He talks about this
[36:10] company, Periodic Labs, what they need
[36:12] to do. These are all the places you want
[36:13] to go through it. The company's involved
[36:15] at these levels. This becomes the
[36:18] embodiment side. Okay, we're getting
[36:21] into the embodiment side now. From
[36:23] compute to labor is the opportunity. He
[36:24] makes the point that every major
[36:27] investor in VC he speaks speaks with
[36:30] sees labor costs as the single largest
[36:32] addressable market for AI. If the global
[36:34] labor spend is roughly 50 trillion, then
[36:37] anything can perform. This is the
[36:39] revenue that they are looking to get.
[36:42] This is what they're going to get as AI
[36:45] agents and as humanoids and as
[36:48] autonomous vehicles come. This is where
[36:50] it is. These are the jobs. So regardless
[36:53] of kind of where your mindset is on
[36:55] this, remember this is what they're
[36:56] after and this is what all of this stuff
[36:58] does. So this is the ultimate scaling
[37:01] law of capitalism.
[37:03] You're finally getting to labor. This is
[37:05] why I say this is the end of capitalism
[37:07] the way we know it. The AI will
[37:09] cannibalize everything. And that's what
[37:11] I believe will happen. That's why I'm
[37:12] the most bearish person as we get to
[37:14] 2030. But right now, you're investing in
[37:17] AI. I can't worry about 2030 until we
[37:19] get closer and see what the market's
[37:21] going to do. We're trading day-to-day
[37:22] here. We're trading what's going on. And
[37:24] right now, if your job is to make money,
[37:26] I'd be focused again on AI and looking
[37:28] at the next stage of it, which I'm
[37:30] calling the proactive stage, which
[37:32] involves all of the things that he
[37:33] mentioned here. A global neural network
[37:35] of edge devices. This is the proactive
[37:37] stage. Each learning locally, each
[37:39] contributing to a shared intelligence
[37:41] layer that spans both bits and atoms.
[37:43] The true TAM for AI isn't the $1
[37:45] trillion chip market that we're seeing
[37:47] now. It's the $50 trillion global labor
[37:49] market. Every factory robot delivery
[37:51] drone and humanoid assistant becomes a
[37:53] node in the world's most valuable
[37:55] network, the network of learning
[37:56] machines. That is the next stage. We
[37:59] haven't even gotten there yet. And we're
[38:00] going to get there starting this year or
[38:02] next year. We don't know. We've got Alon
[38:03] Musk doing something. I had to cancel my
[38:05] whole Tesla thing for this week because
[38:07] I don't have enough time. Um, this
[38:09] section of Dylan Patel's interview on
[38:11] ondevice reinforcement is one of the
[38:13] most forward-looking in the whole
[38:15] points. I'm not going to go through the
[38:16] whole thing, but this is all on NPUs and
[38:19] all on the edge. The next intelligent
[38:20] frontier is not in the data center. He
[38:23] talks about this. It's not in the cloud.
[38:25] It's not in the things that you've
[38:26] invested in so far. It's at the edge.
[38:28] So, as we build up the data centers,
[38:30] we're going to be doing this at the
[38:32] edge. Meaning involved in the physical
[38:34] world, involved in human um in uh AI
[38:39] agents. Everything is going to be
[38:40] happening in a reasoning basis. This is
[38:42] the part that disrupts the labor side.
[38:45] Uh data center AI is brilliant for
[38:47] training, but it's too slow for
[38:49] reaction. Again, the reactive stage
[38:51] where all of the stuff is going uh you
[38:55] guys can read this on your own, but he
[38:56] starts to get into the need in the
[38:58] autonomous vehicles. He made a comment
[39:00] in this interview about Alain thinking
[39:02] until we get AI interacting with the
[39:04] physical world, you don't have ASI.
[39:06] Please expand on this point. I'm not
[39:07] going to read this. I just want you to
[39:09] understand that until we get to the
[39:11] point of actually having
[39:14] AI interact with the physics of the
[39:17] world, Alon Mus point is we can't have
[39:19] ASI. It makes perfect logical sense to
[39:22] me. You can have it be really smart. It
[39:24] can do things, but until it can actually
[39:26] look at something and then react to it
[39:28] and be involved in it, we're not there
[39:30] yet. We have a long way to go, but
[39:31] you're going to start seeing some of
[39:33] this with autonomous vehicles. That's
[39:35] why they are so important to the front
[39:37] loing of that TAM is because once you
[39:39] get to humanoids on wheels, you're
[39:41] getting closer to humanoids. I was going
[39:42] to do a big thing on humanoids. I'll do
[39:44] that next week. From playbook to play,
[39:46] why NPUs are a AI's championship moment.
[39:49] If you guys are not subscribers to 22V,
[39:52] I wrote this this week. It's a long deep
[39:55] thematic piece on NPUs. It goes through
[39:58] including the companies and things that
[40:00] you should be involved in. And again, so
[40:02] you can see where this goes. This is
[40:04] just one of the uh scenarios that I went
[40:07] through. Take from this. This is how you
[40:09] can use my documents. When I do a deep
[40:12] research one where it's 10, 12, 30
[40:14] pages, uh you bring it into a chat and
[40:17] then you start going through the
[40:18] investor takeaways. You can take it even
[40:20] further. I'll show you some more on
[40:21] that, but that's the way I use it. So,
[40:22] the MPU one went out this week. Now, in
[40:25] terms of the demand side, we got a ton
[40:27] of things this week on this chip demand
[40:29] continues absorbing all new supply. So
[40:32] there was earlier on in the week which
[40:33] gets forgotten some article on Oracle
[40:36] and renting prices and they don't have
[40:39] the margins. Their stock sold off about
[40:42] 8% and then it rallied all the way back
[40:44] before the Trump announcement. Uh Kobay
[40:48] letter this
[40:50] really good one in terms of uh uh going
[40:52] through you can follow this there but
[40:54] computers quickly becoming the world's
[40:55] most valuable commodity
[40:58] continues on this thread. AI comput
[40:59] demand is now growing over two times the
[41:01] rate of Moore's law, creating a massive
[41:03] shortage. Uh,
[41:05] something everyone needs to be on top.
[41:07] AI has broken this law. AI's compute
[41:09] demand has grown at double the rate of
[41:10] Moore's law over the last 10 years. Now,
[41:14] Sam Alman interview
[41:18] A16Z.
[41:19] Another one to listen to. Uh, I didn't
[41:21] listen to the whole thing though. I
[41:22] listened to most of it. What does Sam
[41:24] mean when he says capability overhang in
[41:27] the interview? He said this in there. So
[41:30] I wanted to take this further for you
[41:31] guys. He is saying today's models are
[41:33] already capable of much more than people
[41:35] realize are routine use. There's a gap
[41:36] between latent ability and mainstream
[41:38] deployment awareness. This is a really
[41:40] critical thing. So when these deals are
[41:42] happening with Nvidia, when they're
[41:43] happening with all of these big places
[41:45] with AMD, they get to know how far ahead
[41:49] these models are. If you knew what the
[41:51] future held, and we're talking about
[41:52] doubling computing power if you already
[41:54] had something that could do something
[41:56] unbelievable and you saw it, you're
[42:00] going to be willing to invest in it,
[42:01] particularly if you're Nvidia and people
[42:02] that are going to benefit from the
[42:04] compute needs. But also if they have the
[42:06] money and they are concerned with curing
[42:09] cancer with all of the things that will
[42:12] happen that Demis Sabis has talked about
[42:14] that Sam Alman has talked about desiring
[42:16] the education side everything the
[42:18] choices that are going to have to be
[42:19] made because we don't have the compute
[42:20] electricity he says this regularly you
[42:23] would make investments too a backlog of
[42:25] untapped abilities and current models
[42:27] we've never seen this before where the
[42:29] models again to Dylan Patel's point are
[42:32] moving faster than the supply We don't
[42:35] have the buildout. The buildout
[42:36] theoretically should have happened a
[42:37] long time ago, but that's not the way
[42:39] this works. That's why this is not a
[42:41] typical technology cycle. So, if you
[42:43] compare this to the dotcom bubble,
[42:45] you're making a huge mistake. If you
[42:46] compare it to any cycle, you're making a
[42:48] huge mistake and you will be chasing
[42:50] this. The things that can delay this
[42:52] regulations from the government, which
[42:54] are happening, and that's a risk. I was
[42:55] going to focus on that, but that can
[42:57] slow it down. Listen to the all in
[42:58] podcast from last week. Also listen to
[43:00] all the moonshots that can slow it down.
[43:03] rare earth can slow it down. We could
[43:05] not get power. We could have a power
[43:06] problem. It's not going to happen from
[43:08] the models. So, just remember that that
[43:10] the models are moving faster than the
[43:12] the government can deal with it. It's
[43:14] moving faster than the power and the
[43:15] compute can keep up with it.
[43:21] Does this mean the models are being
[43:22] slowed from release due to demand?
[43:24] Yes, you read his comments on this. So,
[43:28] um the compute and power breaking it
[43:30] down. So, one of the things I also do is
[43:32] I take two transcripts, put them
[43:33] together. Will you compare the Altman
[43:36] and Patel things and go through it um in
[43:38] terms of are they saying the same thing?
[43:39] What are their views? Sam Alman's
[43:41] capability overhang, we just talked
[43:43] about it compliments this Dylan Patel's
[43:46] view. If model improvement were too
[43:47] slow, it would be severe, but he remains
[43:49] confident that scaling laws are holding
[43:50] the capabilities will keep rising. Now,
[43:52] he doesn't get to see what OpenAI is. He
[43:54] gets to hear Scuttlebutt on it, which is
[43:56] one of the reasons why he's saying we're
[43:58] not there yet based on everything he's
[43:59] heard. It justifies the massive capex
[44:02] buildout. They're going to keep building
[44:03] out. This is going to keep happening.
[44:05] This is not a bubble. They are making
[44:07] more advancements. So when people say,
[44:09] "Oh, the model's not as good as it
[44:10] should be at this point." They don't
[44:12] even see the models. They don't even use
[44:14] the models. I guarantee you the people
[44:15] that are complaining about it. Even if
[44:17] they're a tech person, just go back and
[44:19] look. If they've been saying this for a
[44:21] year, nobody changes their views on AI.
[44:23] Nobody. I've gone back and reattended
[44:25] very sel I see someone say, "Nope, I
[44:27] underestimated." Alon Mus said there was
[44:30] no way that OpenAI would ever get the
[44:32] money for Stargate. I now the complaint
[44:34] is he's getting too much money. Nobody
[44:36] admits they're wrong. This is kind of
[44:37] the world that we live in. Altman
[44:39] highlights supply scarcity. Patella
[44:40] firms ongoing demand growth fueled by
[44:42] continued breakthroughs. Together they
[44:43] suggest an AI economy still driven by
[44:45] real technological momentum, not an
[44:47] overbuild. Uh Moonshots podcast this
[44:49] week.
[44:51] So did they speak about Claude Imagine
[44:53] in the podcast? I'm only bringing up one
[44:55] part because again I don't have uh
[44:56] enough time on this. So claude imagine
[44:58] came out real time software. So remember
[45:01] I just showed you something I did in
[45:02] Claude in terms of building something
[45:04] that took three minutes that wasn't a
[45:06] piece of software but they are talking
[45:07] about claude imagine which allows you to
[45:09] go from idea to startup big SAS firms
[45:13] can cannibalize their own business risk
[45:16] the incumbent dilemma there I'm starting
[45:17] to get into this software thing I get
[45:19] asked a lot of times on the software
[45:20] side I'm going to spend some time on it
[45:22] now the entire 13 trillion labor market
[45:24] becomes the new addressable market this
[45:26] they continue on the same themes that we
[45:28] had heard I like when different smart
[45:29] people are coming up with exact same
[45:31] themes. Now, software is eating labor. I
[45:34] again want to say that for everyone who
[45:36] has tried to sell me on Salesforce.com
[45:38] and Adobe and they're too oversold and
[45:40] this is going on and they're going to
[45:42] benefit.
[45:43] As someone who uses it, I find it highly
[45:46] unlikely that any software company,
[45:49] particular a big software company, where
[45:51] their price to sales are already at
[45:53] levels that are suggestive of being a
[45:56] software company, if your growth of new
[45:59] revenue stops, meaning if you can't find
[46:01] it, you're in trouble. So, they're going
[46:04] to have to meet a very big hurdle in my
[46:06] opinion to actually get out of the
[46:08] doldrums uh and actually survive. I
[46:10] think all of them are under attack. And
[46:12] this is part of the thing that goes on.
[46:13] So this is another A16Z titled software
[46:16] is eating labor. This is focused more on
[46:18] the labor side. Software's new goal,
[46:20] replace labor, not just digitize it.
[46:22] Startups literally apply for job
[46:23] listings. So you have to understand it.
[46:25] Startups literally apply for job
[46:26] listings. They're offering to do the
[46:28] task for less than human wages. So these
[46:31] are startups that are going into job
[46:34] opportunities and highlighting that
[46:37] they're an AI receptionist for 20,000
[46:39] versus 45. This arbitrage has started,
[46:41] guys. This is a profit margin bonanza in
[46:44] terms of getting rid of people. I hate
[46:46] to say it, but the global scare
[46:47] opportunity. The labor market dwarfs
[46:49] software. The future giants will be
[46:50] those that make software look small by
[46:52] automating labor directly.
[46:55] Points of agreement between that podcast
[46:57] and Dylan Patel's. Again, both believe
[47:00] traditional SAS margins and models will
[47:02] be challenged by AI native entrance.
[47:03] Both see enormous new market
[47:04] opportunities by replacing humans.
[47:09] Jeff Beav's family said your margin is
[47:11] my opportunity. That was the business
[47:13] back in 2007 to 2020. The AI adapt
[47:19] adaptation of this your job is my
[47:21] opportunity. Artificial intelligence
[47:22] entering the MPU area. Unfortunately,
[47:25] that is what's happening.
[47:28] One more thing in the moonshots podcast
[47:30] at minute 49 Dave talks about other
[47:33] areas outside of semis where the supply
[47:35] chain beneath the surface where we could
[47:37] find companies in that space. Please
[47:39] give me the details on that. That's all
[47:41] I did guys transcript. I'm just showing
[47:43] you how you can get ideas. It goes in
[47:45] from that point reads what he wrote and
[47:47] it gives you a bunch of companies in
[47:49] here. Okay. Next step I do I go through
[47:54] I ask it. It gives me the companies. It
[47:57] gives me the theme. Then now for each of
[48:00] these three verticals only give me
[48:01] public companies that are mid or small.
[48:03] And again I'm looking for a broadening
[48:05] out. So the most of these are large cap.
[48:06] But if you guys want to go through it
[48:08] that's fine.
[48:10] Then it goes through. It gives me small
[48:11] cap businesses midcap businesses. I give
[48:14] that to John Ro. He gives me a technical
[48:16] score. Then I go through and have an
[48:17] analysis. And now I have names to trade
[48:19] that have a great technical score. Oh I
[48:22] mention missed one thing. Sorry. In this
[48:24] one here, uh, I wanted to go through the
[48:26] most recent earnings reports to find out
[48:28] that they are seeing large demand. So
