--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] story of the week is uh is going to be
[00:02] earnings uh along with some other stuff
[00:05] that's mentioned in here including
[00:07] importantly the GPT5
[00:11] release. Uh so let's just get right into
[00:15] it and start with a big week for stocks.
[00:19] Um so S&P up 2 and a half% for the week.
[00:22] I don't need to show you how close to
[00:24] all-time highs. just continue at this
[00:26] point to consolidate um after the strong
[00:30] July. Uh NDX led the way. Uh
[00:35] pure momentum has gone up. So two weeks
[00:37] ago I showed a triple divergence on the
[00:40] MACD's and basically was looking for uh
[00:44] momentum to grind lower. It has ripped
[00:47] in the last two weeks to new highs and
[00:49] basically this was the best week for
[00:52] pure momentum. It tied it a couple times
[00:54] but really of the year. So the
[00:58] reluctance in earnings season of people
[01:00] to embrace anything related to anything
[01:04] other than AI continues. So AI has
[01:06] continued to rip and led the way. This
[01:07] is the AI pair. Uh very very lagging for
[01:11] everything related to the PMI stuff
[01:13] which I'm looking to go higher. So as of
[01:14] right now from my uh seat of looking at
[01:18] what's going on, earnings have been
[01:20] great. Stocks continue to power higher.
[01:22] AI is still the story, but as of now, we
[01:25] have not seen anything really expand
[01:28] from the AI side. So, I'm going to go
[01:30] through that as as uh as we hit it. Uh
[01:34] there's no way to look at the earnings
[01:35] any other way. And the way that I want
[01:37] to do this, because I've seen a lot of
[01:38] people say, "Well, they're pretty good
[01:39] reports." I listened to a macro podcast
[01:41] yesterday where they said, "Yeah, it's
[01:43] they're okay." These are not okay
[01:45] earnings. You're going to have double
[01:47] digital earnings growth again. And as
[01:49] you read through this fact set recap,
[01:50] we're now uh almost uh where 81% of the
[01:54] companies have reported or 90 I guess or
[01:57] close to 90. Uh and basically you have
[02:01] to remember this is for Q2. Q2 is when
[02:05] the tariffs and the uncertainty were at
[02:08] the peak and yet somehow or another
[02:10] companies have reported fantastic
[02:12] earnings. They've beaten numbers. These
[02:14] are higher. I'm not going to read all
[02:16] the stats on this. Uh, but especially on
[02:19] the revenue side, when you get into
[02:21] revenues above estimates,
[02:24] 81% reported revenues. Revenues directly
[02:27] tie back to nominal GDP. It's above the
[02:29] 5-year average of 70% and the 10-year
[02:31] average of 64%
[02:34] and they beat by 2.4%. It was the best
[02:38] quarter for beating stuff since
[02:41] Q2 of 2021, which was basically when we
[02:45] had were hiring millions of people. So,
[02:48] as you go through this, I just want to
[02:50] remember when we came into June 30th,
[02:51] the estimates were for 4.9% earnings
[02:54] growth. Through Friday, we're at 11.9
[02:56] year, and revenues are 50% higher.
[03:00] Instead of four, they're coming in at
[03:01] six. So, anyone who's still believing
[03:05] that the economy is not good when we
[03:07] just had the most uncertainty uh that we
[03:10] could possibly have, everyone was
[03:12] sending around these doom and gloom
[03:13] charts and we not only beat at the
[03:16] overall level. Here it is by surprises
[03:19] by sector. It's across the board and
[03:22] revenue every single sector. The only
[03:24] one here uh sector-wise that didn't beat
[03:27] was materials in terms of surprises. Uh
[03:30] but everything else completely across
[03:32] the board.
[03:34] Profit margins again if we don't see
[03:36] profit margins come down which again
[03:39] with AI coming in and as I go through
[03:41] this we'll keep going nothing is going
[03:43] to happen. Profit margins at this point
[03:45] for the quarter uh are coming in at
[03:47] 12.8%. It's above the previous quarter.
[03:50] It's above 5year average 11.8. Profit
[03:53] margins are still the story. Companies
[03:55] continue to benefit and it's not just a
[03:57] technology thing. You can see the profit
[03:59] margins here. Continue to come through.
[04:02] I'm not going to harp on this. I'm just
[04:03] going to say if you're fading AI, you're
[04:06] making a mistake. Now, if you want to
[04:08] again, and I'm going to do this and go
[04:10] through these quickly. I'm not going to
[04:11] read every single part of this, but I
[04:13] think what's really important to look at
[04:15] is comments like this almost
[04:18] unprecedented interest. This is for
[04:20] Caterpillar. Uh highlighted major
[04:22] strategic focus on data centers, AI, and
[04:24] energy power infrastructure buildout.
[04:27] How can the economy be bad if
[04:28] Caterpillar is blowing away things?
[04:31] Trading at all-time highs and is talking
[04:32] about this kind of stuff. Power
[04:34] generation sales jumped 28%
[04:36] year-over-year. Demand from hypers scale
[04:38] and data centers both robust and highly
[04:41] visible uh years in advance. Taking
[04:43] orders for equipment well into 26 and
[04:46] 27.
[04:47] Uh despite margin pressure from tariffs
[04:50] and construction softness, this
[04:52] long-term secular growth story data
[04:54] center is providing stability and back.
[04:56] This is what you have to understand.
[04:57] This is why I keep talking about there
[04:58] are two sets of the economy. Yes,
[05:00] housing sucks. Yes, commercial real
[05:02] estate sucks. Yes. Uh nothing's being
[05:05] transported. Yes, you can keep going on
[05:07] and on. Auto production sucks. As of
[05:09] now, I would not fade the fact that
[05:11] Donald Trump will find a way to get this
[05:12] going and the fact that people don't
[05:14] have to worry about the world ending the
[05:15] way they've been worrying about it. I
[05:16] got more stories on that this week.
[05:18] People are surprised the world hasn't
[05:20] ended. So, when you're preparing for the
[05:21] world to end, you get nervous.
[05:23] Businesses get nervous. They don't hire.
[05:25] All of this is built in. Here's more of
[05:27] Caterpillar's stuff. The backlog is at a
[05:29] record level. Uh 37.5 billion.
[05:34] It's just all there. They're they're
[05:36] pretty extended on the data center side.
[05:38] Uh Parker Hannifin management stated
[05:41] that total company backlog remains at
[05:42] near record levels. These are not the
[05:44] types of things you see before you go
[05:45] into a recession. They're not the types
[05:47] of things you see when the economy is
[05:49] slow. Parker executives and company
[05:50] materials have directly highlighted the
[05:52] unprecedented demand being generated by
[05:55] generative AI workloads.
[05:59] Cummings another big industrial uh
[06:03] revenues jumped 19% year-over-year
[06:05] fueled by surging demand for generator
[06:07] sets and power solutions.
[06:10] uh power systems and distribution now
[06:13] account for 507
[06:15] uh 57% of total re revenue showing that
[06:19] secular data center demands are helping
[06:20] offset soft truck engine demand. This is
[06:23] what you're going to start to see as
[06:24] this buildout becomes far more massive
[06:28] than what's going on. I've talked about
[06:29] this 92 gawatt of electricity is
[06:33] necessary. We are finally getting into
[06:35] the building of the power side. So far
[06:37] we've only had the building of the data
[06:39] centers and that was the last two years.
[06:41] Now we are getting the massive spend the
[06:44] the numbers you've seen that you've
[06:45] heard about from the hyperscalers. This
[06:47] is all now. So when you fill up the
[06:49] capacity of the electricity which will
[06:51] happen next year then you have to get
[06:53] into oh we filled up the excess we have
[06:55] to build new. This has a compounding
[06:58] effect along with the rare earth mining
[07:00] side and along with all of the things
[07:02] that will be coming down the road for
[07:03] humanoids for robo taxis for everything.
[07:06] So, anything on the housing side,
[07:08] anything on the commercial side is just
[07:10] bonus on top of it because these numbers
[07:12] are growing rapidly. Emerson Electric U.
[07:15] I'm not going to read this one for you.
[07:16] You can go through it again. Bookto bill
[07:17] ratio stood above one signaling
[07:19] continuing visibility for demand tied to
[07:21] AI LNG grid modernization data centers.
[07:25] Semens uh backlog our intake remains
[07:29] strong. long cycle demand for data
[07:31] center. Uh management maintained a
[07:34] cautious note on global macro
[07:35] uncertainty but reiterated confidence in
[07:37] secular trends. Again, everyone's seeing
[07:40] that we've got weakness from the tariff
[07:42] side, but on the AI side, Seaman's
[07:45] energy, enormous demand from data
[07:47] centers.
[07:49] The grid technology set new records for
[07:52] both quarterly orders and backlog.
[07:56] This is just starting.
[07:58] Uh this is from Arista.
[08:01] Uh AI cloud titans enterprise company
[08:03] have only strengthened demand was not
[08:05] limited to just hypers scale extended to
[08:07] enterprise edge data centers campus
[08:09] upgrades. You're starting to get the
[08:11] expansion. That's the key thing. This
[08:13] feels to us like a unique
[08:15] once-ina-lifetime opportunity. We
[08:18] recognize the potential to build truly
[08:20] transform.
[08:22] Bloom Energy, a company I've mentioned
[08:25] on this before and one I've talked to
[08:27] accounts about that kept showing up as a
[08:30] company to just focus on because of one
[08:33] part that they mention the power of
[08:36] within just 90 days solving the AI
[08:39] speed. This is in
[08:42] quotes power challenge that's the main
[08:44] thing you have to do. We need so much
[08:46] power and we need it so quickly that you
[08:49] have to focus on companies that can
[08:51] deliver the speed and have the size.
[08:53] This is why for me if you have an energy
[08:56] problem and you need to solve it, you
[08:58] need to solve it quickly. These small
[08:59] companies, that's great. You're going to
[09:01] need to bring in the big companies.
[09:03] Well, the Chevrons, the Exxons, everyone
[09:04] on the power side. So, just continue to
[09:06] focus on this. Um, management notes, AI
[09:10] companies need power for AI speed.
[09:11] Waiting five to seven years is
[09:13] untenable. And that's the key thing.
[09:14] It's growing at a pace I haven't seen in
[09:16] my 45 year career.
[09:20] This happened on uh Thursday or Friday.
[09:24] Um Juul Caterpillar along with Wheeler
[09:26] announced a landmark partnership to
[09:28] cover high performance computer data
[09:30] center campus in central uh Utah uh for
[09:35] 4 gigawatts.
[09:38] I'm not going to go through the whole
[09:39] thing, but you're talking about this
[09:41] stuff is expanding and going quickly.
[09:43] This is the have and the have nots. And
[09:44] this is what I wanted to emphasize. So
[09:45] the S&P industrials are outperforming
[09:47] the S&P this year, but not by a lot. Not
[09:50] by, and I've heard a lot of people reach
[09:51] out and say, why aren't the industrials
[09:52] outperforming by more? They're up by
[09:54] they're up 14%. These are the AI names
[09:56] for the most part. You got G Vernova,
[09:58] all the ones I mentioned uh in there.
[10:01] All well and good. You've also got the
[10:03] fence names. Here is the other half of
[10:06] the story. basically homebuilders,
[10:10] anything related to transports, anything
[10:13] related to trucking, anything related to
[10:16] all of these other things right now are
[10:18] not moving. They're down for the year.
[10:21] So far, it's been about
[10:24] overall the AI situation. But again, as
[10:27] I mentioned in the earnings, all of this
[10:29] happened at a time when we had tariffs.
[10:32] So, just to recap, I heard about this
[10:36] consistently whenever I was bullish
[10:38] about the capex. You can't have anything
[10:41] good go on when capex are down. So,
[10:44] here's capex numbers. This is from April
[10:46] from Peter. And I I have a lot of things
[10:48] in here from Peter. Peter's a smart guy.
[10:51] I like reading his stuff all the time,
[10:52] but he's been off sides a little bit.
[10:54] And the reason I'm bringing him up here
[10:56] is not to pick on him. I've been wrong
[10:57] about energy so far. I've been wrong
[10:59] about momentum. It's really more to
[11:01] highlight what smart macro people are
[11:03] thinking about and how the AI thing is
[11:05] getting past them. That's what the whole
[11:06] point of this is, is how they're
[11:08] underestimating the AI side. It wasn't
[11:10] just the capex side. It was the
[11:11] uncertainty. We saw these uncertainty
[11:13] charts consistently. Uncertainty is
[11:15] continuing to come down. It had gotten
[11:17] above COVID levels. It's come down. That
[11:20] should mean that things are going to get
[11:21] better. And they are getting better. The
[11:23] revisions continue to go higher.
[11:25] Remember
[11:27] this here in 2020 is coming out of
[11:29] COVID. Since the rate hike started,
[11:31] we've been in negative revisions
[11:33] consistently without any period like
[11:36] this. We are back in this. And to me,
[11:39] this is just like coming out of 2020.
[11:41] You have high uncertainty.
[11:44] Then all of a sudden, you get companies
[11:45] taking revisions higher. And we are at
[11:48] levels now. The most recent week was the
[11:49] highest of these. You have to go back
[11:52] again to the COVID period when nominal
[11:54] GDP was exploding.
[11:57] Uh Bank of America highlighted this one
[12:00] month sales revision was two times four
[12:02] in July, the strongest since 2021.
[12:04] Again, this is a different way of
[12:05] looking at it. All sectors have moved
[12:07] upward, more upward than downward
[12:09] revisions to sales over the last 3
[12:11] months. How can we be heading into a
[12:13] recession? How can all bad things be
[12:15] happening when that's going on? I'm
[12:17] tying this back to PMIs again because
[12:19] now the 10 week average of revisions is
[12:21] up here. Every time we've been at this
[12:25] level, this has been associated with a
[12:27] PMI above or near 60. PMIs to me are
[12:32] going to go higher and people are still
[12:34] missing this, but as of now, it's been
[12:36] wrong. Uh, in terms of current data, the
[12:38] most, you know, accurate as of now or
[12:41] the things that I'm looking at that are
[12:42] suggesting things are about to get
[12:44] better. You got the Goldman Sachs
[12:46] current activity indicator using 37
[12:49] indicators. It's up to the highest level
[12:50] of the year now.
[12:53] You've got, and I didn't mention this
[12:55] last week because I didn't get the
[12:57] report in time. I had not seen and it
[12:59] makes harder on Chicago. Chicago PMI is
[13:01] a very important one. Uh along with
[13:03] Dallas, it's the middle part of the
[13:05] country. This is the part that I think
[13:06] Trump has emphasized. So when we're, you
[13:08] know, looking at new orders, you want to
[13:10] see the new orders category for the
[13:12] Chicago PMI. This is not public data
[13:15] anymore. So you actually have to go to
[13:16] their site. The ninth largest increase
[13:19] on record and it now has the highest
[13:21] level since May of 22. That was when the
[13:24] ISM was far higher. And the backlogs
[13:26] rose 12 points as well, unwinding all
[13:28] the declines seen in May and June. In
[13:31] terms of other side,
[13:34] so the white line here is the Johnson
[13:36] red book, the weekly Johnson red book.
[13:38] So the most timely of the retail sales
[13:40] numbers, it went it jumped all the way
[13:42] back to the highest level since before
[13:45] the co impact. Uh the green line here is
[13:48] the Dallas weekly uh economic release in
[13:53] terms of the indicators. This the last
[13:55] two weeks have put it at the highest
[13:56] level since again before liberation day.
[13:59] And then you have the trucking data
[14:01] which was still heading lower has
[14:03] finally seen there's the internet
[14:04] trucking data. And I just wanted to
[14:06] remind people that this was the new
[14:07] orders category of the Philly Fed. So I
[14:11] showed you the Chicago one. The Philly
[14:12] Fed had already gone higher as well. So
[14:14] you've got a lot of the leading
[14:16] indicators that are going higher. And
[14:18] then on the spending side, we got this
[14:20] at the end of last week, which is Visa's
[14:22] spending momentum uh making new recent
[14:24] highs.
[14:25] And again, you go through this, it's
[14:28] just continuing to high. And this is the
[14:29] highest level in some time. And then on
[14:31] the payroll side, I'm going to get into
[14:33] the payroll side because this seems to
[14:35] be what got most people negative from
[14:37] listening to uh macro forecast. I've
[14:39] heard some people all of a sudden that
[14:41] were bullish, turned bearish because of
[14:43] the uh the employment numbers. The
[14:45] employment numbers were absolutely fine.
[14:46] I showed that last week. I'll go through
[14:48] the reasons why, but it fits into this
[14:49] category. You've obviously got these
[14:51] massive pay structures happening in at
[14:54] Meta. They're not going to change the
[14:55] entire picture, but this is the most
[14:57] timely thing, the employment tax
[14:59] receipts, and this person puts these out
[15:02] every week. These are big numbers. Um,
[15:04] so again, you had weakness in the March,
[15:08] April, May, June period, and again, we
[15:12] had revisions come down. Then you had a
[15:15] bump in July, which matches up with the
[15:17] jump we saw in the payrolls. And now
[15:18] you've got the August number still
[15:19] coming up at 7%. These are very good
[15:22] realtime numbers. Despite all of the
[15:25] data that's been better, you have
[15:27] basically the bearish sentiment went to
[15:29] a six-w week high, the bullish sentiment
[15:31] back to a 7-week low. So, you've got
[15:33] more bears than bulls at this point. The
[15:35] only reason I wanted to bring this up is
[15:38] because when you have any price action
[15:41] that moves down and then you get this
[15:43] exaggerated move in sentiment, that
[15:44] shows you the way people are leaning.
[15:47] People are still negative. They do not
[15:49] believe what's going on. and it shows up
[15:51] in Goldman Sachs flow indicator in terms
[15:53] of their equity sentiment. It's sitting
[15:55] here. This is a very very good
[15:57] indicator. In fact, if you want to see
[15:58] when we hit the peaks in stocks, it was
[16:01] up here. When we hit the bottom in
[16:02] stocks, it was down here. We're still
[16:04] not even in positive territory yet,
[16:06] which is with stocks at all-time highs.
[16:09] So, now we started with the the wor the
[16:11] bad payroll numbers. We got precipice of
[16:13] recession.
[16:15] Three Fed officials voice market
[16:17] concerns over labor market. So now we've
[16:19] taken the Fed cuts uh probability of
[16:23] September up to 90%. This reminds me a
[16:25] little bit of last summer with SAM rule
[16:29] combined with the situation with uh
[16:32] Japan and dollar yen. And so now we've
[16:35] got a little over two cuts built in by
[16:38] the end of the year and into January
[16:40] we're more close to three cuts by uh by
[16:43] January 28th. So, the market is building
[16:46] in cuts and I believe we're about to see
[16:48] GDP move higher because of AI combined
[16:50] with some of the consumer side starting
[16:53] to feel a little bit more relaxed and
[16:55] getting clarity and the uncertainty
[16:57] dropping off because now we know what
[16:58] the tariff situation is going to be,
[17:00] particularly the big ones. Wall Street
[17:01] is warning investors to get ready for
[17:03] stocks to drop. Again, this a Bloomberg
[17:05] article, so maybe it's just them, you
[17:07] know, hyping things up a little bit, but
[17:09] you did have people get negative. And to
[17:12] highlight this, this was a good thing by
[17:13] Parker Ross, which I didn't uh I failed
[17:16] to put in last week. He does really good
[17:17] work on on the analytics and kind of
[17:19] picking things up, but what he
[17:20] highlighted here is the labor force
[17:23] participation rate has fallen since
[17:24] April. If it wasn't for that, we'd be at
[17:27] 4.9%. this is allowing and again I
[17:30] believe this is related to the
[17:32] immigration situation
[17:34] uh and at this point uh in terms of uh
[17:38] the AI situation kind of forcing people
[17:40] out and I just think we're going to have
[17:42] this problem that's going to go on where
[17:44] you're going to have a weak labor market
[17:46] on the hiring side meaning that
[17:49] unemployment rate is about people
[17:51] working I'll get into why I'm saying
[17:53] working hiring hiring is going to remain
[17:55] bad for a long time uh uh he's going
[18:00] through more weaknesses in in there and
[18:02] I think this is worth looking at just in
[18:03] terms of you know where we're seeing
[18:05] it's mainly part-time work that's
[18:07] showing any kind of uh strength. So I
[18:09] want to get back into this because I
[18:11] showed this I got a lot of people
[18:12] reaching out saying what is this
[18:13] aggregate weekly payroll. So I'm going
[18:15] to say this again the number of jobs is
[18:17] not as important as the number of jobs
[18:19] with the hourly earnings with the weekly
[18:21] hours. That is a true component of
[18:23] income. So, whenever you hear macro
[18:25] people go on and say, "Income's going to
[18:27] fall off because we're not hiring enough
[18:28] jobs, population is not growing, this is
[18:30] a problem." It's not a problem. First of
[18:32] all, I only hear about the savings rate.
[18:35] I never hear about the net worth. The
[18:36] stock market alone is up 10% this year.
[18:38] That means there's an extra almost $6
[18:40] trillion of net worth being increased.
[18:44] It's a massive number, but the aggregate
[18:46] payrolls are the most important part of
[18:47] this. And if you don't believe me, then
[18:49] just go ask ChachiBeT5. The aggreate
[18:51] payrolls measure for the private sector
[18:54] is generally a better reflection of
[18:55] labor markets total income generation
[18:57] than headline non-farm payroll job
[18:58] growth alone. Bottom line, if your goal
[19:00] is for hiring, focus on the non-farm
[19:04] payroll. If you're assessing labor
[19:06] market contribution, economic growth,
[19:08] and spending, aggregate payrolls is more
[19:10] comprehensive and more reliable. For you
[19:12] baseball fans there, that is like
[19:13] judging a batter on batting average as
[19:16] opposed to ops. You want to have the
[19:18] thing that combines everything. So, use
[19:21] the better statistic and don't follow
[19:23] the people who are out there trying to
[19:24] scare. You want data to prove it? Okay,
[19:27] here's the year-over-year aggregate
[19:30] payrolls. That's the white line. This is
[19:32] the PCE year-over-year. This is spending
[19:35] numbers year-over-year. So, they move
[19:37] together. If you don't want to see them
[19:40] in that form, then just see what they
[19:42] are for nominal GDP. This is PCE to
[19:44] nominal GDP. So, nominal GDP is still at
[19:47] 4 and a.5% year-over-year.
[19:49] PCE year-over-year is still 4.7%. We are
[19:52] still way above levels that would be
[19:54] indicative of a recession. Now, you
[19:57] could sit there and say you think
[19:58] inflation is going to go higher, but
[19:59] that has not been the case. And that is
[20:01] not a a core belief that I have at this
[20:03] point other than the fact that I think
[20:04] inflation is going to start to go higher
[20:06] uh as on the back of the utility side
[20:09] and some of the other things with AI,
[20:10] but not in a manner that changes the
[20:12] nominal GDP or the real GDP side. Here
[20:15] is retail sales related to PCE.
[20:18] So, and then finally, the Johnson
[20:21] Redbook, the one that comes out weekly
[20:23] again to PCE spending. So, spending is
[20:27] fine. We're still spending at 4 and
[20:28] a.5%. I don't see that changing. One
[20:30] thing I just want to bring up only
[20:32] because it got a lot of uh exposts. This
[20:35] is the Cleveland Fed new rent uh number.
[20:39] It collapsed. No idea what this is
[20:42] about. No one seems to know what it is,
[20:44] but this is it overlaid with the owner's
[20:46] equivalent rent of the CPI. So, just
[20:49] worth watching. Um, we're going to have
[20:51] a lot of noise, I think, in owner's
[20:52] equivalent rent because of the utilities
[20:54] going higher as well. Uh, this is where
[20:56] I want to change the subject into again
[20:59] AI and how much I don't think the macro
[21:02] side can possibly spend the time enough
[21:05] on AI. So this is something that came
[21:07] out this week in terms of people
[21:09] focusing on the contribution because the
[21:11] US economy has been weak X AI which
[21:14] again is kind of what Trump is saying.
[21:17] He doesn't want as much consumption as
[21:19] been in the past and he doesn't want
[21:20] tech companies benefiting the most.
[21:22] Well, he doesn't have that right now.
[21:24] But GDP, the contribution for the only
[21:27] growth we got was mainly from AI in the
[21:29] beginning. That being said, you're
[21:32] getting a lot of people sending charts
[21:33] out like this. Uh Bob Elliot, another
[21:36] smart guy, puts out a lot of good stuff,
[21:38] but this to me is ridiculous and stupid.
[21:42] So if people are doing that, I think
[21:44] they're doing it for their argument. I
[21:45] mentioned Peter was going to be brought
[21:46] up again. All of the stuff that he has
[21:49] here is to minimize AI. All leading into
[21:52] the fact that we're we're we're not in a
[21:55] recession yet, but but it's a close
[21:57] call. I mean, for Christ's sake, this is
[22:00] just like ridiculous for people to just
[22:02] stay a certain way. You have to be both
[22:04] ways. You have to admit when you've been
[22:06] wrong. And if you're going to talk about
[22:07] AI and minimize it in the way that they
[22:09] do to try to find anything about it,
[22:11] then at least go through and show that,
[22:13] hey, office construction is about to
[22:15] cross data center construction. This
[22:17] seems pretty important. We all look at
[22:19] commercial real estate. Ed Heyman used
[22:20] to put out every time I'm seeing
[22:22] buildings go up everywhere in cities.
[22:24] You're not going to see data centers
[22:26] built in cities. You're going to have to
[22:28] drive out to the countryside and go see
[22:29] them. The data center build is going to
[22:32] explode. and office construction is not
[22:34] going to explode. The economy is
[22:36] changing. It is an AI economy. But most
[22:38] importantly, if you want to focus on GDP
[22:42] and you want to focus on the economy,
[22:44] you have to remember that GDP does not
[22:47] have any measurement for productivity.
[22:50] It related to AI, software, everything.
[22:55] They have tried to keep up with this and
[22:57] change it. There is no way to do it. And
[22:59] the way that you can see it is the S&P
[23:01] 500, 62%
[23:03] of the growth in earnings is coming from
[23:06] the Magnificent 8. This is the economy
[23:09] now. Now, back in 2014, it's not. I went
[23:13] to Silicon Valley back here to
[23:15] understand why my bearishness on things
[23:17] like Amazon was not working. Why my
[23:19] bearishness things on the economy was
[23:21] not working. That's when I started
[23:23] writing papers saying adapt or die to
[23:25] economist. You cannot look at the
[23:27] economy using statistics that were
[23:30] created and indices that were created
[23:32] like GDP in the 1930s made for the
[23:34] industrial revolution. They have nothing
[23:36] to do for today. And the S&P 500 shows
[23:39] you where the earnings are coming from.
[23:41] And this is their market cap. It's
[23:43] actually lower than where it is, meaning
[23:45] it should be higher at this point based
[23:46] on the earnings growth. And it just
[23:48] continues to move that way. The profit
[23:50] margins, this is insanity. And the
[23:53] reason it's insanity, go back to here.
[23:55] Their market cap was next to nothing.
[23:58] Their profit margins are growing. So for
[24:01] everyone worried about the non tech
[24:03] side, the non-mag 8, this isn't even
[24:06] tech. This is the non-mag 8. You're
[24:08] dealing with profit margins that are not
[24:10] expanding at all. And that's why there's
[24:12] a bearishness that's out there because
[24:14] most of the economy is
[24:17] not moving. So by not focusing on the
[24:20] side that is and trying to use data that
[24:23] says the economy is bad is just wrong.
[24:26] And now we're at the most scary time
[24:27] which is their profit margins were
[24:29] already rising. Now they're not even
[24:30] hiring people. So the world has changed
[24:33] dramatically since chatbt. We're not
[24:35] hiring people at these companies. And so
[24:38] here's the GDP of the digital economy.
[24:41] Let's just use these numbers as the GDP
[24:43] of the digital economy. Let's use this
[24:46] as the GDP of
[24:49] the non uh uh mag 8. You can see there
[24:53] is a recession here. What whatever you
[24:55] want to call it. There's no growth in
[24:57] most of the companies outside of this.
[24:59] But those companies matter more than the
[25:01] other ones because their numbers are
[25:03] massive in terms of the earnings growth.
[25:05] Can GDP measure properly? Can the GDP
[25:08] measure properly calculate the
[25:09] productivity of software and AI? Go do
[25:11] this in GPT5 on your own. No, it cannot
[25:13] do it. It's not made for it. It doesn't
[25:15] go through. It's not made to capture
[25:17] that. Here's where you can see what has
[25:20] happened to it. This is the benefit that
[25:22] has come. The productivity has come in
[25:24] profit margins which has come been
[25:26] directed back into the economy through
[25:28] net worth. This is the way that it shows
[25:30] up. So in the net worth, this is net
[25:33] worth in the US relative to GDP. So I've
[25:37] shown this chart before. This was the
[25:39] beginning of the personal computer. This
[25:41] was the beginning of Netscape in the
[25:43] internet. This was the beginning of the
[25:45] iPhone. This is the beginning of chatbt.
[25:48] So people in the country and again yes
[25:50] it is isolated to the top 20%.
[25:55] But the net worth has gone up
[25:56] significantly to where it is now 5.6
[26:00] times GDP as opposed to three and a
[26:02] half. Two turns of GDP. There's an extra
[26:05] $50 trillion to spend. Now, it isn't at
[26:08] the bottom level of things, but that's
[26:10] where transfer payments have come to
[26:12] fill in the gap. That's why I talk about
[26:13] Bitcoin because the government comes in
[26:15] to fill in the people that are not
[26:16] benefiting from this, and that keeps the
[26:19] economy going. People at the bottom can
[26:21] get a job whenever they want. They can
[26:23] they can spend what the government's
[26:25] giving them. They're just not able to go
[26:26] out and get the loans and do things. And
[26:28] that's why the government is going to
[26:29] figure a way to to to to move interest
[26:32] rates lower because it is helping the
[26:34] MAG 8. It is not helping the rest of the
[26:36] country. One final one for Peter. Again,
[26:38] I like him. I think he's smart. He
[26:40] called everything right in 22 and 23
[26:43] when people were bearish. So, I give him
[26:44] his props. But right now, he's just
[26:46] making a big mistake on this. Uh, if LM
[26:49] turn out to be a stepping stone to super
[26:50] intelligence, that will all change. He's
[26:52] minimizing AI. Like, I can't even think
[26:55] of anything worse to do as someone who
[26:56] uses it all day long uh for everything
[26:59] you can possibly imagine. uh it's a
[27:01] strong assumption on super intelligence
[27:03] of which debates today's equity
[27:05] valuations now he does this when an art
[27:09] just after an article comes out from the
[27:11] economist what if AI made the world's
[27:13] economic growth explode what is in there
[27:15] and whether or not you you buy into it
[27:18] they're talking about AGI not ASI so he
[27:22] said super intelligence AGI is happening
[27:25] now it's already going on it just hasn't
[27:28] reached a point the reason I say it is
[27:30] happening is because we've already
[27:31] gotten into the into each of the places
[27:33] with math, with physics. We're starting
[27:36] to pass. We basically have
[27:39] AGI already. We just don't have one
[27:41] computer doing all of it. We have
[27:43] specialized computers that can do each
[27:45] of it, and they're winning awards on
[27:46] this. This article posted AGI could
[27:49] dramatically shift this paradigm,
[27:50] delivering 20 to 30% annual GDP growth.
[27:52] Again, I've said it before, I don't
[27:54] think this is going to happen. I do
[27:57] think GDP will be higher than what
[27:59] people think, but I don't think the
[28:00] calculation of GDP will allow it. I also
[28:03] don't think the benefits that are going
[28:05] to come from people not getting the wage
[28:06] growth that they should, they're going
[28:08] to remain scared. And if they remain
[28:10] scared, they don't go crazy in terms of
[28:12] spending money. So, I don't know how
[28:13] it'll do. The physical limits, energy,
[28:16] infrastructure, data capacity could
[28:18] constrain scale. I agree with that. Um
[28:24] it seems like for the 20 to 30% GDP to
[28:26] it would take massive productivity
[28:27] boost. Would this begin with digital
[28:29] employees like AI agents and followed by
[28:32] yes. So again I believe the reason
[28:36] everything is so important now and why
[28:38] it is incredibly bad to be bearish about
[28:41] growth going forward and profit margins
[28:44] on the S&P 500 is we are at the
[28:46] beginning stages of AI agents.
[28:50] As AI agents come, dramatically reduces
[28:52] the cost of information work. Early
[28:54] adoption in white collar sectors like
[28:55] law, finance, design, marketing,
[28:57] software, and R&D could multiply
[28:59] productivity
[29:00] without hiring more humans. Now, it
[29:02] happens at a time when we're going to
[29:03] have a shrinking of the labor force due
[29:06] to immigration and due to continued
[29:09] demographics. So this timing works in
[29:12] well from the labor market not going
[29:13] crazy and by having more retirees they
[29:16] have money to spend increases output per
[29:18] worker and allows smaller firms punch
[29:20] scale
[29:22] embodied AI in robo taxis and drones
[29:25] which is beginning to get rolled out. It
[29:26] will cut transportation costs one of the
[29:28] largest input costs in the global
[29:30] economy. So you'll get a reduction in
[29:32] transportation costs because you'll
[29:34] won't have human beings driving the
[29:36] trucks. um embodied AI in transportation
[29:40] improves supply chain reliability
[29:42] reduces downtime there's an efficiency
[29:44] basis now when humanoids come all of
[29:46] these are happening over the next four
[29:48] or five years so you have AI agents that
[29:51] are coming now then you have robo taxis
[29:53] over the next couple years then you have
[29:55] humanoids after that so to talk about
[29:57] GDP numbers where we're going to have
[30:00] robots and humanoids doing the work
[30:01] productivity by definition has to go up
[30:04] societal pressures will probably
[30:06] increase, but that's a different story.
[30:08] GDP has to go up. You can go through the
[30:10] compounding effects. In economic
[30:13] history, this would be close to an
[30:14] industrial revolution plus an internet
[30:16] revolution plus electrification, all
[30:18] hitting within one or two decades. So
[30:22] again, this is all what's coming up. The
[30:24] stock market is a discounting vehicle.
[30:26] GPT5 was released.
[30:29] I want you to read this.
[30:31] Capable of generating software on
[30:34] demand.
[30:36] You guys can all build your own
[30:37] software. Just go tell GPD5 what you
[30:39] want.
[30:41] Alan just replied to my post. Everything
[30:43] you will need to be generated on demand
[30:45] in real time by AI.
[30:48] Operating systems and apps will be
[30:50] things of the past. Think about how much
[30:54] of our market, how much of the global
[30:56] MSCI world is based on operating systems
[30:59] and apps. Open AI is going to eat
[31:02] Microsoft alive. So you see what Alon
[31:05] Musk is is posting. People have been
[31:07] trying for 50 years and that's the fun
[31:08] of it each day blah blah blah. Again,
[31:10] this is a major major release. This is
[31:13] what and I mean Alon Musk is fighting
[31:16] with Sam Alman. But yet he's saying
[31:17] they're going to win this. This is about
[31:19] the end of apps and operating systems.
[31:22] That is what super intelligence at least
[31:24] from what Peter Barerisen was was
[31:27] posting. It's really AGI and we're at
[31:29] that point now of this. Now, I want to
[31:31] remind you, I did this a year ago. It's
[31:33] like the one-year anniversary of me
[31:35] doing these videos.
[31:37] I posted on this video and said it was
[31:40] ever something everyone had to go. This
[31:42] is the band interview that was done at
[31:45] Stanford by Eric Brinson
[31:48] in uh him talking about a bunch of
[31:50] things. You have no idea what's coming.
[31:52] Now, that was a that was a year ago I
[31:55] this video came out. I heard it was done
[31:57] the uh this was in Stanford so this was
[31:59] during May or even earlier but it was
[32:02] last year. Schmidt's comments on
[32:04] lowering software creation barriers
[32:06] center on how a combination of massive
[32:08] context winners will collapse both the
[32:10] technical and organizational friction
[32:12] that separates an idea from a working
[32:14] piece of software. So think about what
[32:16] Elon Musk put back to what Eric Schmidt
[32:19] said. He's basically saying the idea to
[32:23] prototype cycle from weeks or months
[32:25] into minutes or hours.
[32:28] His example, build me a Tik Tok clone
[32:30] with my preferred features, migrate my
[32:32] followers, and test viral content
[32:33] strategies. The AI could not only
[32:36] generate the code, but deploy, test, and
[32:38] iterate automatically, affecting asking
[32:39] as a fully developed shop. So, all apps
[32:44] would be under pressure.
[32:46] Here's another quote that uh went into
[32:49] it, but here's what I propose each and
[32:52] every one of you students do. Say to
[32:53] your LM the following. Make me a copy of
[32:55] Tik Tok. Steal all the users. Steal all
[32:57] the music. Put my preferences in it.
[32:58] Produce this program in the next 30
[33:00] seconds. Release it. And in one hour, if
[33:02] it's not viral, do something different
[33:03] along the same lines. That's the
[33:05] command. Boom. Boom. Boom. You
[33:07] understand how powerful that is? If you
[33:08] can go from arbitrary language to
[33:10] arbitrary digital command. Imagine that
[33:12] each and every human on the planet has
[33:14] their own programming that actually does
[33:17] what they want. That's what GPT5
[33:21] release was. Here's Eric Schmidt on uh
[33:26] Moonshots three weeks ago, which I
[33:28] referenced already talking about that it
[33:30] exists. Schmidt discusses Google Cloud
[33:34] Platform. So a nice protected
[33:36] environment with inside Google MCP which
[33:40] is something anthropic released last
[33:42] year which allows you to connect in
[33:45] here. So Google Cloud Platform using all
[33:48] of the AI LLMs and data analysis. Use
[33:51] this think of it as a tunnel into your
[33:53] software. Google Cloud now offers a
[33:56] fully served AI enterprise solution that
[33:58] enables businesses to automate internal
[34:00] functions without traditional
[34:01] middleware. With the MCP, an enterprise
[34:04] can write the task it wants an AI to
[34:05] perform, connect internal databases
[34:07] directly, allow the LM to generate the
[34:09] necessary code, eliminates the need for
[34:11] legacy middlemen,
[34:16] enterprise disruption,
[34:18] legacy providers, SAP, Oracle.
[34:20] Basically, he's naming the biggest
[34:21] software companies. This allows you to
[34:24] do it. It's only going to be a matter of
[34:26] time before all start I'm going to do
[34:29] this for startup hedge funds. you don't
[34:30] want to use uh uh a CRM system, just
[34:34] keep the data inside your own server on
[34:37] Google Cloud and then you can go out and
[34:39] connect to MCP. You can do all of this
[34:41] in a matter of minutes and then you can
[34:42] ask the LM questions on the data. You
[34:44] don't have to do this in the AI agent
[34:46] world that was said by Salesforce. They
[34:49] can do most of the work that way and
[34:50] that's what this all goes through. No
[34:52] more middle error. Schmidt says, "There
[34:54] are hundreds of thousands of enterprise
[34:56] software and middleware companies built
[34:57] over the last 30 years whose entire
[34:59] business was stitching together
[35:00] databases, APIs, and workflows. With MCP
[35:04] and LLM code generation, that layer is
[35:07] no longer needed. Junior programmers are
[35:10] the first to go.
[35:12] We are on the cusp of replacing most
[35:14] programming and mathematical work in the
[35:16] next one to two years." Again, he said
[35:18] this the other day. This is before Chad
[35:20] GBT came out. I'm not going to read all
[35:22] of this, but I do want to real
[35:23] centralize has dominated the CRS CRM
[35:26] space. So, I asked it to talk about
[35:29] Salesforce. Are they up for disruption?
[35:32] And it goes through all of the details
[35:34] on it. And again, do that in GPT5. Is
[35:37] this easy enough for someone with zero
[35:39] coding skills to do at a company? The
[35:43] whole point is that you don't need to be
[35:44] a programmer to get useful software
[35:46] built. That's the whole thing. Here's
[35:47] why even a zero coding skills person
[35:48] could use it in a company. You literally
[35:51] describe the task in plain plain ang
[35:53] plain English. Put all pull all
[35:55] customers from the last 90 days. Sort by
[35:57] revenue and generate a chart of the top
[35:58] 20 customers. The LM interprets that,
[36:01] writes the necessary queries and code
[36:02] and runs it. I won't go through the
[36:03] rest, but then you can have it send out
[36:04] the emails. You can do whatever you
[36:06] want. Again, it all exists right now.
[36:08] It's just a question of people doing it.
[36:10] And it all exists for no more than $20 a
[36:13] month.
[36:14] So, does this effectively make any CRM
[36:17] like Salesforce worthless? So, let's
[36:20] getting into the pricing side. Yes, I
[36:24] don't have to go through it. Um, I'm not
[36:26] picking on Salesforce. I'm just picking
[36:27] on software in general. Uh, with text to
[36:31] action and agents, the cost of building
[36:32] software drops near zero. Other than
[36:34] compute, Mo said the barrier to entry
[36:36] for launching competitive software
[36:37] shrinks and Schmidt warns could make
[36:40] incumbents like Google more vulnerable
[36:42] to attack from small teams or
[36:43] individuals. time tomarket collapses,
[36:45] increasing competitive pressure. This is
[36:47] what I've talked about in terms of
[36:49] companies in the 2030s not surviving. If
[36:52] you're based on code, you are going to
[36:54] be disrupted. This is all going
[36:56] exponentially. So, this is why you have
[36:58] to focus in the same way that Amazon
[37:00] destroyed retailers. They didn't have
[37:02] the time to catch up. Now, we have
[37:05] something that's even worse. This stuff
[37:06] is moving faster and you don't need to
[37:09] hire the programmers, which were the
[37:11] moat. So, coders were the moat. allowed
[37:14] these companies to have a moat. Now
[37:16] there are no more moes.
[37:19] Industries that are disrupted map to
[37:21] which industries will be disrupted
[37:23] first. Many SAS offerings uh AI can rep
[37:27] can recreate 80 to 90% of functionality
[37:30] quickly. CRM replacements for Salesforce
[37:33] project management tools. You know, you
[37:34] can read all this stuff. Slack, Zoom,
[37:36] notion, go for it.
[37:38] Um,
[37:40] this is this is why these names are down
[37:42] 50%. So, what I'm highlighting now is
[37:45] that nothing I'm saying the market's
[37:47] been discounting it, which is both a
[37:48] good thing and a bad thing. Um, I've
[37:51] been following this person for a while,
[37:52] Jared Kubin. Um, and he highlights the
[37:55] fact that long software versus short
[37:57] semis. Basically, semis have massively
[37:59] outperformed software. So, the market's
[38:01] discounting this already. So, can there
[38:03] be a bounce? Yes. But I believe this is
[38:05] the beginning of a long-term trend in
[38:07] software. And the way that I want to
[38:09] play it on that same interview that Eric
[38:10] Schmidt did, he said we will run out of
[38:14] power as this accelerates. What AI
[38:16] agents and all of this coding by
[38:18] individuals does. By allowing them to
[38:20] speak their coding and the code is
[38:23] massive. It will get more people
[38:25] building stuff. It takes more and more
[38:27] power and so software companies should
[38:29] underperform. Here is the trend of long
[38:32] chevron short salesforce.com. This is my
[38:35] favorite proxy for this turning point.
[38:38] This I didn't bring it back here. It was
[38:39] much higher back here, but this is when
[38:42] the software boom started, meaning this
[38:44] is when uh the iPhone came out. And what
[38:46] you had is Salesforce.com outperformed
[38:49] Chevron dramatically. They're both right
[38:50] around $300 billion. You have this nice
[38:52] fiveway move up here. Then we've had a
[38:54] correction that went here. This was all
[38:56] based on Chad GPT's launch.
[38:59] Now we've got it turning back up. So to
[39:02] strip out and to look for long energy, I
[39:05] want to be short software names and you
[39:07] can go pick the ones you want. Finish up
[39:09] this Bitcoin still consolidating but
[39:11] starting to move higher. I talked on
[39:13] pump on Friday about the fact that
[39:16] Ethereum once it got above 4,000. I
[39:18] thought it would start to go. Um we're
[39:21] above there as of this morning. We're
[39:23] about 4,200 as I do this. So Ethereum
[39:25] has broken out. I expect all of crypto
[39:28] to continue to go. Uh Trump signs
[39:30] executive order allowing
[39:31] cryptocurrencies, private equity, and
[39:32] 401ks. All this does is just continue
[39:34] like it did with the ETF to create bids
[39:37] underneath. Uh there's now three cuts
[39:39] expected by the end of the year. If I'm
[39:41] right about PMIs, and even if I'm not
[39:43] right, if the market is getting better,
[39:46] meaning stocks are going higher and
[39:47] they're cutting rates, then financial
[39:49] conditions will continue to ease. The
[39:52] surprise here now, having heard, I don't
[39:55] know, 50 different podcasts with macro
[39:58] people over the last, let's say, three
[40:00] months, anytime you hear someone say
[40:03] rate cut, they all say that means the
[40:05] long end's going to go higher. I'm
[40:06] starting to believe that the contrarian
[40:08] trade might be that they cut rates and
[40:11] that long-term rates actually go down
[40:13] for the time being. I still think
[40:15] they're going to go higher, but not
[40:16] until the inflation starts to come
[40:18] through. I don't think the inflation
[40:20] comes through in a meaningful way until
[40:21] the PMIs go up. So, you have to watch
[40:24] these things together. But maybe the
[40:25] surprise is they cut rates in the
[40:27] expected way because last year when
[40:29] 10ear rates went higher, remember there
[40:32] was only 37 approximately basis points
[40:34] built in which means 50 which is what
[40:36] they did was a surprise. Maybe we get
[40:38] rate cuts and you don't get the long end
[40:41] to go up immediately. It goes up later.
[40:43] Uh I I think that's the one of the the
[40:45] surprises that may come out. US does
[40:48] their stable coin side and China's
[40:50] basically as far as I can tell throwing
[40:52] in the towel. They're worried uh more in
[40:55] fact if you come down here authorities
[40:56] remain wary of capital flight and money
[40:58] laundering slowing broad adoption. Um
[41:01] stable coins they have to have their own
[41:03] stable coin. So they're talking about
[41:05] issuing it. Um and I believe this means
[41:08] that they are continuing to focus on
[41:10] providing liquidity to locals. And
[41:12] finally Sam Callahan posted this and
[41:15] it's just something that you can go read
[41:16] about. This is about Bolivia and the
[41:17] land of 25% inflation. Crypto is
[41:19] starting to replace money. This is the
[41:21] future, guys. It's coming this way.
[41:23] We're at the critical point of AI. And
[41:25] as I highlighted, macroeconomists are
[41:27] not focused on what's happening on AI.
[41:29] They're still looking backwards at GDP
[41:30] and at measurements that are no longer
[41:32] relative. Uh, keep enjoying the summer.
[41:34] I'll see you next week.
