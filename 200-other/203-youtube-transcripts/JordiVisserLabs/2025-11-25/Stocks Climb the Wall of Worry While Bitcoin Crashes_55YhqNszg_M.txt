[00:00] Right. Overall, uh, fairly quiet week to
[00:02] end the summer. Hopefully, this video
[00:05] will, uh, give you some things to think
[00:08] about coming out
[00:10] as we begin September. Uh, you know,
[00:14] despite everything that happened, uh, in
[00:16] this month, all of the worries, the
[00:19] reciprocal tariffs, everything going on,
[00:23] uh, Fed drama.
[00:25] S&P posted its fourth monthly gain in a
[00:28] row, finishing up two and a half%.
[00:32] Big month for small caps. So, small caps
[00:34] also had their fourth month. I've been
[00:36] focusing a lot on small caps. Uh you're
[00:38] going to hear that more and more as I
[00:40] focus on the PMIs and a tide that lifts
[00:42] all boats. Uh but the Russell 2000
[00:46] finished up more than 7%, its biggest
[00:49] month
[00:50] since the election. Uh banks continue to
[00:55] power higher as part of this
[00:56] reflationary boom theme. Uh banks around
[00:59] the globe are doing great as I've
[01:00] highlighted in prior videos, but the BKX
[01:03] finally made new all-time highs, taking
[01:05] out the 2021. And I want you to think
[01:07] about that 2021 peak area where it fell.
[01:11] That is basically where the PMIs peaked
[01:13] when the rate cycle started. So now
[01:14] we're coming out of
[01:17] a bludgeon PMI. Uh MSCI World XUS con uh
[01:23] picked up the pace a little bit up 2.6%
[01:25] also up for the fourth month in a row.
[01:29] Earnings uh we're now basically done
[01:32] with earnings as we've gotten through
[01:33] Nvidia. Uh this is where we are in the
[01:36] MAG 7 26.6% year-over-year growth. The
[01:39] 493 493 8.1 these were the expectations
[01:44] coming into the quarter. So we obviously
[01:48] beat in a big way. Uh here's where we
[01:52] are Q2. So there's the 26.6. This is the
[01:56] the 493 at 8.1. And you can see the
[01:59] expectations are for declining
[02:02] year-over-year growth rates in this. So
[02:05] again, uh we still have a scenario that
[02:11] the economy and profit margins are
[02:13] lining up the same way. So you have the
[02:16] strength in there showing up in the
[02:18] sector revenue side. So this is
[02:20] surprises at the sector level. It's
[02:22] across the board the beats. Uh and these
[02:24] numbers are pretty big especially in a
[02:25] world of nominal GDP of around 4%.
[02:27] That's how much sector revenue is
[02:29] beating at the earnings level which is
[02:31] going to get into the profit margin
[02:32] story. So AI is helping drive this. AI
[02:36] is helping drive the profit margin
[02:38] story. And that is where again I'll keep
[02:41] saying it. macro people are too focused
[02:43] on academic things that again are not
[02:46] where they should be and this is the
[02:48] place bonds. So you've been tortured
[02:52] trying to be long bonds or short bonds.
[02:55] This is 10-year yields in the US. Uh
[02:57] does look from a chart perspective. I
[03:00] mean it looks good. Looks like it'll
[03:02] probably move higher uh on the back of
[03:05] growth getting better, but the reality
[03:06] is inflation is down here right now. So
[03:09] I'll get into that more later, but this
[03:11] is the big story and this is what I
[03:13] expect in the uh final four months of
[03:16] the year is a PMI that is starting to
[03:18] rise higher on the back of the expansion
[03:21] of the needs for the AI infrastructure
[03:24] where it was really just about compute.
[03:26] Uh now it is a massive buildout help
[03:30] being funded again by the hyperscalers
[03:32] raising their capex numbers an expansion
[03:34] around the globe in capex numbers. uh
[03:37] but also the fact that the AI action
[03:40] plan is in place and now we're no longer
[03:42] going to be using the excess capacity or
[03:45] the already built things out there for
[03:47] power like 3M Island as an example and
[03:50] we're now going to get into the need to
[03:51] build all this stuff where there's
[03:53] tremendous shortages on things like gas
[03:55] turbines, transformers, cooling systems,
[03:58] everything along those lines. Uh, I
[04:00] expect the PMI to gradually move higher
[04:03] as the tide lifts all boats and all
[04:06] companies start to see some benefit that
[04:09] comes from this kind of massive
[04:11] buildout. Uh, to show how important this
[04:15] PMI is, this is basically this is taking
[04:17] the 20month average uh, and this is back
[04:21] over time. We've never been down in this
[04:23] kind of a level and not been in a
[04:24] recession. So, when you think about the
[04:26] economy, people have been trying to
[04:28] forecast a recession. We are not in a
[04:29] recession. We're not even close. But the
[04:32] manufacturing side of the economy has
[04:34] been in a recession and it's been in one
[04:36] for one of the longest times in history.
[04:38] So sitting down at these levels uh for
[04:41] 20 months below way below 50 is
[04:45] important because it means there's a lot
[04:47] of companies, a lot of low multiple
[04:49] value stocks, a lot of things that
[04:50] haven't seen anything positive. This
[04:52] will not be uh in my opinion, you know,
[04:55] some massive buildout of the old his uh
[04:58] the way you'd see it historically. This
[05:00] is a different one because it's about
[05:01] the AI demand and it's leading into
[05:03] humanoids. It's leading into a new fame
[05:05] of all kinds of hardware and cars, robo
[05:08] taxis, all of this stuff is coming uh
[05:11] down the pike in the next 3 years. Uh Ed
[05:15] Yardi put this out. I've I've talked
[05:17] about this, but it just continues. And
[05:19] he highlights it. We are seeing signs
[05:20] that S&P 500 company earnings gains are
[05:22] broadening. The percentages of S&P 500
[05:25] companies with positive three-month
[05:26] changes in forward revenues and forward
[05:28] earnings have increased significantly in
[05:29] recent week. That suggests that the S&P
[05:32] should do well. So here it is. This is
[05:36] the change in terms of earnings and
[05:38] where this connects back in. And I had I
[05:41] took that post. I put it into chat GPT
[05:45] asked it the broader implications. uh
[05:49] S&P 500 excluding the MAG 7 should
[05:51] perform well talking about the 493 as
[05:54] more companies are participating in the
[05:56] growth uh for much of 2023. They were
[05:59] heavily concentrated mega cap tech.
[06:00] Broadening earnings revision success
[06:03] suggests healthier market participation.
[06:06] If the S&P 493 strengthens, investors
[06:09] may rotate into midcap and non- tech
[06:11] sectors, diversifying performance away.
[06:13] This comes amid worries of a slowing
[06:15] economy, Fed policy shifts, and tariff
[06:18] headlines.
[06:19] Chad GPT does a really nice job of just
[06:22] explaining it. Now the reason this is
[06:23] important this is also your denny and
[06:25] this is uh uh a report that he put out
[06:27] late uh last year and this just shows
[06:30] the importance of the S&P revenues
[06:32] relative to the PMI. So historically
[06:36] whenever you get these big revenue surg
[06:40] uh surges in PMIs you end up getting
[06:42] revenue surges. So they've been directly
[06:44] related. If the PMI goes higher
[06:48] you're going to see revenues start to
[06:49] broaden in terms of where they're coming
[06:51] from.
[06:52] uh S&P 500 year-over-year stock price
[06:56] relative to PMIs just to show again how
[06:59] important the PMI is relative and this
[07:02] is the this is my chart. This is S&P
[07:05] year-over-year currently versus the PMI.
[07:07] The PMI is here. S&P year-over-year is
[07:10] up 15% right now. Uh again, I expect
[07:14] PMIs to go higher. We did get one
[07:16] earnings report just to highlight on the
[07:17] the PMI side. That's important. This is
[07:20] the durable goods order. This is for the
[07:22] capital goods new orders non-defense
[07:24] xair year-over-year. Uh I showed this
[07:28] chart before back over time but it is
[07:31] sitting up here. This is again related
[07:33] to the data center and the computer
[07:34] equipment buildout. Uh Goldman Sachs
[07:37] current activity indicator continues to
[07:39] move higher in August. But the thing I
[07:41] want to highlight this breaks it down by
[07:43] manufacturing, consumer, labor, housing,
[07:45] other
[07:47] this bar here is manufacturing and what
[07:49] you can see is this which is the PMI is
[07:52] the highest number going back based on
[07:55] what they have here in the manufacturing
[07:57] component. So we've seen basically
[07:59] manufacturing bottom here in April
[08:01] gradually move higher. It continues to
[08:03] move higher.
[08:05] And here's something that was released
[08:09] this month. This is the Dodge
[08:11] construction network momentum index for
[08:14] construction. So it breaks it down by
[08:16] commercial building institutional and
[08:18] you can see these changes. More
[08:19] importantly, you can see this chart.
[08:26] Planning data skyrocketed in the month
[08:28] of July on the back of several large
[08:30] projects entering the planning queue for
[08:32] data centers, research and development
[08:33] labs, hospitals and service stations.
[08:36] On the commercial side, all sectors
[08:38] gained momentum. All sectors over the
[08:41] month, notably led by strength in data
[08:43] centers and warehouses. In July, the DMI
[08:45] increased by 41% compared to the same
[08:47] period last year. Commercial segment
[08:49] increased by 24. Institutional segment
[08:52] 85. If all data center projects between
[08:55] 23 and 25 were excluded, commercial
[08:58] planning would be up 26% from
[09:00] year-over-year. So to strip out the data
[09:02] centers which is what this red chart is
[09:06] commercial
[09:08] in this is their their index now is
[09:10] stripping out. So here it is. And now
[09:12] when you strip out the data centers
[09:15] what you can see here is
[09:18] an increase that's dramatic. And if you
[09:20] think about the PMIs again PMI sitting
[09:22] down here and now we're getting up. So
[09:26] there's just no way to refute it in
[09:28] terms of the fact that we are seeing a
[09:29] pickup. that shows up in DRAMs. Now,
[09:31] this is an important um one. This is the
[09:34] PMI, the orange line overlaid with DRAM
[09:37] spot prices. This is these are the
[09:39] DDR3s. These are the uh the old school
[09:41] ones, the hardware ones, the ones again
[09:44] that have been you can see it bottomed
[09:45] here. It was gradually going up. It has
[09:48] accelerated.
[09:52] These DDR3D RAM chips are widely used in
[09:54] PCs, laptops, servers, consumer
[09:56] electronics, and embedded systems,
[09:58] routers. So old school stuff, not
[10:00] software stuff.
[10:02] Analysts use it as a leading indicator
[10:04] of men of the memory cycle shortages,
[10:07] gluts, prices rebound.
[10:13] DDR3 was the industry standard. I asked
[10:15] is it more older hardware? It was the
[10:17] standard in 2008, 2014. This is the part
[10:20] that I think is important. Um, DRAM
[10:23] markets are cyclical like the PMI. Even
[10:26] older Gen DDR3 pricing can signal
[10:28] tightness or over supply that spills in
[10:30] there. Again, think about a tide that
[10:32] lifts all boats. When you start getting
[10:34] through the stuff that you need and the
[10:36] prices go up dramatically and their
[10:37] shortages, you move to the places where
[10:39] you can get stuff. Now, one thing that I
[10:43] just want to highlight, if I'm right
[10:44] about the PMIs, and I think we will get
[10:46] up close to 60 just based on a bunch of
[10:49] uh leading indicator signals that uh
[10:52] come from the earning side, the
[10:53] revisions, everything. If we get up
[10:56] here, this is the year-over-year oil
[10:58] price. And I'm bringing this up, you're
[10:59] going to start hearing me talk about oil
[11:01] more and more just because of the
[11:02] sentiment side of it, and because I'm
[11:04] hearing people saying sub50 oil. I like
[11:07] to find ideas that where the stocks
[11:10] charts look great and where the
[11:12] sentiment is bearish. So, this is
[11:13] year-over-year oil. This is the
[11:15] six-month forward contract. When PMIs go
[11:18] up 260, we've basically, you can go
[11:22] back. This is a 60% year-over-year
[11:24] increase. So, again, oil, if we were to
[11:26] have a 50 to 60% year-over-year
[11:28] increase, that would be talking $100
[11:31] oil. I don't think we're going there,
[11:33] but again, nobody thinks we're going
[11:35] higher. Hedge fund slash this came out
[11:36] late Friday. Hedge funds/bullish oil
[11:39] bets to 2007 low on glut concern. Here
[11:42] we are. This is the chart. The reason I
[11:44] care about this AI
[11:48] Eric Schmidt April 9th house and energy
[11:50] commerce hearing. We need all sources of
[11:53] power to accelerate because we don't
[11:54] have a choice. You can't solve the whole
[11:56] problem without an all power solution.
[11:58] All power. All sources of power. From my
[12:01] perspective, the answer is yes to all.
[12:03] Let the markets sort it out. Let
[12:04] everybody build everything. We need it
[12:06] all now. Now he did that in April.
[12:10] Then in May, processing 40 480 trillion
[12:13] monthly tokens, 50 times increase in
[12:16] just one year,
[12:22] he in the the Q2 earnings call just two
[12:24] months later, he announced that we had
[12:27] processed 480 million tokens back here.
[12:30] That was again in in May. This is in
[12:32] June or July. Now processing over 980
[12:36] trillion monthly tokens. Token growth
[12:39] doubling every 6 to 12 months.
[12:41] Electricity demand from inference alone
[12:43] could rival a midsize nation's grid.
[12:46] This is why Eric Schmidt told Congress,
[12:48] "We need all forms of power, fossil,
[12:50] nuclear, renewables, and we need them
[12:52] now." Every trillion token adds roughly
[12:54] a megawatt of continuous power demand.
[12:56] And with Google now at nearly
[12:59] a quadrillion tokens per month, AI
[13:02] inference is already a multi- aent load
[13:06] on the grid. Uh as I go through the rest
[13:09] of this video, uh GPT5 was released,
[13:12] which basically is exploding inference
[13:14] uh usage. So this is only going to get
[13:18] bigger. And there's a reason again why
[13:21] V3 does not allow you to make movies of
[13:24] more than 8 seconds because we wouldn't
[13:26] have enough
[13:28] power to support it. Uh and that's where
[13:31] the issue comes in. Now Nvidia reported
[13:35] earnings. So again we need power and at
[13:38] the same time we need power. Nvidia's
[13:41] surprise we've been kind of
[13:43] stairstepping down on the revenue side.
[13:46] So, their revenues beat, good number,
[13:50] nothing to be, you know, upset about.
[13:53] Uh, but as Dan Niles put it, I thought
[13:56] Nvidia would report a very strong
[13:58] quarter and was more concerned about
[13:59] their China commentary. I was wrong. In
[14:00] reality, they miss expectations of data
[14:02] center revenues for the first time since
[14:04] the intro of chat GPT. When I get
[14:07] something wrong, I always try to figure
[14:08] out why. And this one baffles me. less
[14:10] than two weeks after they announced the
[14:11] write down. That is when I bullishly
[14:13] wrote uh bullish wrote bullishly on the
[14:16] stock for the first time since there
[14:18] inference demand started to really take
[14:20] off earlier this year with Google
[14:21] reporting they process 50 times more
[14:24] tokens. I just talked about that.
[14:26] Microsoft five times more. As I wrote
[14:29] this past Sunday, I believe between now
[14:30] and Thanksgiving investors should more
[14:32] broadly invested versus buying the Mag 7
[14:36] or tech names. I'm on the same page for
[14:39] different reasons. Uh but the power side
[14:42] and the infrastructure side, the PMI
[14:44] side, he's not saying anything about the
[14:45] PMIs. China Shanghai Composite on verge
[14:48] of the biggest breakout this decade. The
[14:51] China positive stories continue locally.
[14:54] Again, more announcements. People
[14:58] continue to fade China because they're
[15:00] not seeing the old signals they used to
[15:03] see from China. China pushes minimum
[15:05] wage hikes to spur consumption. Michael
[15:08] Pettis, this is certainly good news is
[15:10] most it will easily be the most
[15:13] effective of all various ways has tried.
[15:15] Again, China's important. They're the
[15:17] second biggest economy on the planet and
[15:19] in terms of their contribution to
[15:20] growth. Uh they are right with the US.
[15:25] Uh China races to embed AI across all
[15:28] major industries, tripling their output
[15:30] of AI chips. This is not a good thing
[15:32] for Nvidia.
[15:35] Uh the rare earth thing again I I put
[15:38] this up there because Trump's still
[15:39] talking about it. There will be a
[15:41] meeting coming up. Uh I've talked about
[15:43] growing signs from people I think know
[15:47] uh that there's a high probability. But
[15:50] I think this
[15:52] rare earth magnet again this is what
[15:55] changed the entire tariff situation.
[15:57] It's the reason why I think there has to
[15:58] be some grand deal that occurs. And uh I
[16:03] traveled to China a lot from 2007 to
[16:05] 2013. Andy Roth Rothman basically helped
[16:08] set up most of the the the trips that I
[16:11] uh went out there for. Uh one of my
[16:14] favorite people on China in terms of
[16:15] knowing their living for a long time. He
[16:17] wrote this this week. Are you ready for
[16:19] the world's greatest deal?
[16:23] trade deal between she and Trump is
[16:24] increasingly likely in the coming
[16:26] months. On July 9th, so less than two
[16:29] months ago, uh
[16:32] Trump's unpredictable, but the odds of a
[16:34] trade deal with China, while still low,
[16:35] appear to be rising. Those odds have
[16:38] improved substantially in recent weeks
[16:39] as Trump is focused on meeting she close
[16:41] to a deal close to close a deal around
[16:44] the time of the APEC leaders summit. Um,
[16:47] a deal is not a sure thing, but the odds
[16:48] are high enough that investors should
[16:49] think about how they would take
[16:50] advantage of the potential impact on
[16:52] China's equity markets. Again, this is a
[16:55] a big deal. Remember, it wasn't that
[16:57] long ago that foreign investors pulled
[17:00] out of China. Uh, a variety of different
[17:02] reasons, but one of the major catalysts
[17:04] was fears over uh sanctions. because of
[17:08] the sanctions put on Russia and how much
[17:10] long-term investors got hurt on
[17:13] investing in Russia, those things went
[17:14] to zero and a lot of money pulled out of
[17:17] China. Sentiment has been negative on
[17:19] China for some time. It is amazing how
[17:21] many emails and and notes I get from
[17:23] people whenever I say anything that
[17:25] could possibly be positive about China
[17:27] from a contribution to investing. uh the
[17:31] Chinese yuan is having a
[17:34] big move higher again again as possibly
[17:36] an indication that this is getting more
[17:38] in there is some dollar weakness story
[17:39] involved in it but as you can see when
[17:42] we hit the lows and this is right around
[17:44] the the the lows in the stock market
[17:45] it's also just after the rare earth
[17:48] export ban uh I believe there will be a
[17:51] deal because I believe there's no other
[17:53] way with the rare earth situation the
[17:55] way it is only thing that worries me in
[17:57] this whole thing is that China's
[17:59] continually saying they don't need uh
[18:01] Nvidia chips. Can't possibly be the
[18:04] case, but three years from now probably.
[18:06] All right, Fed drama continues. I'm not
[18:08] going to spend a lot of time on the Lisa
[18:11] Cook thing. We'll let that play out in
[18:12] the courts. Fed is unchartered waters
[18:15] ahead of key decision rate in September
[18:18] because of its dual mandate. Well, an
[18:21] independent Federal Reserve's
[18:22] cornerstone of stable glamour healthy
[18:23] economy. This part here again I think
[18:27] the reason I wanted to include this uh
[18:29] Council of Foreign Affairs piece on here
[18:32] is because I really do believe people
[18:34] are playing a dangerous game with
[18:36] markets. This has been all year. I've
[18:38] heard people, you know, between
[18:40] stagflation, recessions, tariffs are
[18:42] going to take everything down. We're
[18:43] going to have inflation that's going to
[18:45] go forward. The Fed's now making a
[18:47] policy mistake. If I hear another policy
[18:48] mistake thing, uh, people are basically
[18:51] talking about what they think the Fed
[18:53] should do rather than what is happening.
[18:56] And this turmoil going on in the Fed is
[19:00] all related to fiscal dominance and the
[19:02] fact that the administration wants to
[19:04] run the economy hot and the Fed at this
[19:07] point is going against it. You can get
[19:08] into all kinds of academic fights. You
[19:10] can sit in a room, but it's not helping
[19:12] you make money. And that's why I said
[19:13] the bond market is not the place to
[19:15] focus on at this point. But most people
[19:17] sit there and continue to talk about the
[19:18] bond market as a place to be. Uh that
[19:21] resurgence in 2022 is going to be the
[19:23] thing that hurts people because that one
[19:26] little surge of inflation that was due
[19:28] to a one-off situation which has now
[19:30] played its course. There are people that
[19:32] still believe we're going to have
[19:33] serious inflation ahead of the most
[19:35] deflationary technological force that
[19:37] they call it a bubble. So you think of
[19:40] the irony of this whole thing. AI is a
[19:42] bubble. I don't believe in it. I believe
[19:44] we're going back into the world of the
[19:46] 1970s because that's what makes the most
[19:48] sense. It literally sounds ludicrous and
[19:49] it is. Uh because of the dual mandate,
[19:51] the Fed must weigh concerns about both
[19:53] inflation and the labor market.
[19:57] Contrary to expectations, Trump's tariff
[19:59] policies have not yet produced a surge
[20:00] in inflation. No, it has not. It's still
[20:03] 2.7% while core inflation is at 3.1.
[20:06] Just remember those numbers. It's not
[20:09] going to make a big difference if
[20:10] inflation goes up to 3.6 six and or
[20:12] headline goes up to 3.1 core goes up to
[20:14] 3.6 six, which has not happened. But you
[20:17] still have people I wonder if Marco's
[20:19] ever going to be positive. I'm just
[20:21] curious. Uh if this was happening any
[20:23] other country, the stock market would be
[20:24] down significantly. Turkey. Yes.
[20:26] Comparing the US to Turkey makes sense.
[20:28] And it doesn't just stop there. I gave
[20:30] this guy a shout out on a uh on a a
[20:33] report he wrote on on the Mag 7 last
[20:36] week, but going fullans. And I think the
[20:38] most important thing in here, 30s are
[20:41] off a quarter of a point. Bonds are
[20:42] telling you a story here. It's
[20:43] increasingly obvious that the economy is
[20:45] falling down the stairs. That is not
[20:48] It's just I I'm I'm in shock at what
[20:50] everyone does on this stuff to analyze
[20:53] markets. Uh 30-year JGBs. This will
[20:56] again at some point this year. I I'm
[20:59] sure this is the reason why people want
[21:01] to just short bonds. Uh the 30-year bond
[21:05] market in JGB. So, here's the fact.
[21:08] Waller is still the favorite to be the
[21:10] next Fed chair. He sees a quarter point
[21:12] cut in September, then more. I'm back on
[21:16] team team transitory. If this is your
[21:17] next Fed chair, I think you should be
[21:19] caring more to what he's saying and not
[21:22] in the drama that is in there. And the
[21:25] reason is because he's focused on things
[21:28] that are actually happening. There is
[21:30] now clear evidence AI is wrecking young
[21:32] Americans job prospects. So, this was a
[21:34] Wall Street Journal article. It it used
[21:36] a lot of the data from this canaries in
[21:38] the coal mine. Bring it up in chat GPT.
[21:40] It's 57 pages long. You can get the
[21:42] details of it. Eric Brolson is one of
[21:45] the architects. This is from the
[21:46] Stamford digital I don't know digital
[21:49] economy group. Um
[21:52] so it was released in August digital
[21:54] economy lab. Uh it it goes through using
[21:59] real time data from ADP going from 2022
[22:02] to 2025. So it's broad and it's really
[22:05] trying to cover these things. But in the
[22:07] end, the only thing you really need to
[22:09] see is this. So this is from the ADP.
[22:12] This is a couple charts. They included
[22:14] employee headcount among software
[22:16] developers by age.
[22:18] The people being hurt the most,
[22:21] the 22 to 30 year olds coming out of
[22:23] school or on the younger side. Same
[22:26] chart now customer service
[22:28] representatives. There's just no way to
[22:30] refute that. We have a problem in the
[22:33] country where right now generative AI
[22:35] which has reached a an IQ level of 148
[22:38] through GPT5 is able to replace people
[22:42] with no experience coming in because the
[22:44] only thing they have is their
[22:45] memorization skills from school. So it's
[22:48] getting harder and harder for people
[22:50] that are not at the higher end to be
[22:52] able to come in. Um, this is a story on
[22:55] a CEO who laid off nearly 80% of his
[22:57] staff because they refused to opt to
[22:59] adopt AI fast enough. Remember that MIT
[23:02] report? This will this is what this is
[23:04] in reference to. Uh, basically again
[23:07] incumbents having trouble getting people
[23:09] to use AI but not needing the people
[23:12] either as as time goes on. We did get
[23:15] one piece of labor data which continues
[23:18] to weaken. This is the uh jobs plentiful
[23:21] versus jobs hard to get. So the white
[23:23] line here,
[23:26] jobs are getting harder to get and
[23:29] here's the unemployment rate over time.
[23:30] So again, highlighted this before and
[23:32] this matches up uh at least the trend
[23:35] does that if it wasn't for the labor
[23:36] participation rate, we'd be up higher
[23:38] than this probably around 4.9 based on
[23:40] the stuff that Parker Ross did and we
[23:42] wouldn't be having this discussion. So
[23:44] to sit there and say the Fed is making a
[23:46] policy mistake, they're focusing on the
[23:48] weakness in the labor market, which is
[23:50] going to be a a a
[23:52] fact going forward because of the AI
[23:54] pressures. Uh I wrote this in my paper
[23:58] last week in terms of the fact that
[24:00] they're never going to announce the new
[24:02] inflation target is 3% or 3 and a.5%,
[24:04] but the reality is
[24:07] people are starting to realize that
[24:09] that's probably happening. wages.
[24:12] Again, uh Atlanta Fed median wage
[24:16] went to the lowest level during this
[24:18] period. So, we don't have a robust jobs
[24:21] market. We have a weak jobs market. We
[24:24] also have low inflation. And again,
[24:27] until we get a change in oil prices,
[24:29] which I think will happen uh as the PMIs
[24:31] rise, here is unled gas basically
[24:35] year-over-year. And here is the CPI
[24:37] year-over-year.
[24:39] CPI is down at 2.7%. It's where it was
[24:42] during the 2016 to 2020 period. So
[24:47] again, I people that want to fight on
[24:49] inflation, that's all well and good, but
[24:51] you need something to change. Here's
[24:53] another way to look at it. Tenure rates
[24:55] up at 423.
[24:57] Inflation at 270. So the white line is
[25:00] above the orange line to get this
[25:02] sustainable time period. We've been
[25:03] above. All right, we did it briefly in
[25:06] in here, but this was more about the
[25:08] collapse in oil prices. But aside from
[25:10] that, you got to go back a long ways.
[25:12] Like we have tenure rates already
[25:14] significantly above inflation. So unless
[25:16] you believe inflation is going to shoot
[25:18] higher like it did here, doesn't look to
[25:20] me like bonds are off at all. So if
[25:23] they're cutting rates, uh I would be
[25:25] wary about being short bonds as your
[25:27] favorite trade. Unlike last year where
[25:29] the yield curve was inverted in
[25:30] September. They don't talk about that
[25:32] much when they say policy mistake, but
[25:34] the curve was inverted at about minus 10
[25:36] to 15 basis points on twos tens. We're
[25:39] now up above 50 basis points. You're not
[25:42] in the same place. So if they cut 25, if
[25:44] you go back over history and look at
[25:46] what typically happens when they cut
[25:48] rates, is there a chance that tenure
[25:49] rates could go higher? Sure, but the
[25:51] curve is not at the same spot it was
[25:52] last year when it was inverted. The Fed
[25:55] is starting to worry about the housing
[25:56] market. Now, this is the other part.
[25:57] This was in the Fed minutes. So when you
[26:00] start going through and saying, "Okay,
[26:02] it's it's just inflation." It's not just
[26:04] inflation. The labor market is weak. And
[26:06] anyone that wants to fight that is
[26:08] missing a broader picture. There's
[26:09] absolutely no way to refute the fact
[26:11] that the that the labor market, which
[26:13] has seen no negative jobs over the last
[26:16] three months, except for health care.
[26:18] One part of the economy is creating
[26:20] jobs. Uh at this point, the the market's
[26:23] weak. It's not a firing thing. It's a
[26:25] hiring problem because of AI. Uh the Fed
[26:28] is starting to worry about the housing
[26:29] market now. A shift is evident in the
[26:30] Fed's internal discussions. For the
[26:32] first time, several policy makers flag
[26:34] concerns over the housing market,
[26:35] highlighting a weakening in housing
[26:36] demand. I've highlighted we have three
[26:38] months in a row of negative prices on
[26:40] housing. These developments are now
[26:42] being viewed as material to the broader
[26:44] economic outlook.
[26:46] This is obviously about rates.
[26:50] All right, here's the here's the new AI
[26:52] bubble one. I got this this week. The
[26:53] real deepseek moment just arrived. got
[26:55] this from multiple people. Uh I I really
[26:59] don't even know what to say to these
[27:01] things anymore. You guys need to watch
[27:03] more videos. You need to watch more of
[27:06] what I'm about to show you now. This one
[27:08] is a must for anyone who believes
[27:09] there's an AI bubble just because this
[27:12] is an MIT report. Most of the people on
[27:14] this, three of the four on this, they're
[27:16] MIT grads. most of them are still
[27:18] involved with the school and they're
[27:20] coming out and saying this is I mean
[27:21] they don't want to speak out against the
[27:23] school but they're out there saying the
[27:26] faculty is do is thinking completely
[27:28] differently than the students on on
[27:31] this. So I'm going to go through this
[27:33] but I want to make sure you guys realize
[27:34] there will be efficiency gain. So when
[27:36] you see these deepseek moments and you
[27:38] hear it the demand for compute is
[27:41] insatiable. We are not even at the stage
[27:44] of the acceleration. So it doesn't
[27:46] matter how fast the efficiency gains
[27:48] come, the demand side will continue to
[27:50] grow faster than the supply side. I
[27:54] can't use it as much as I used to on the
[27:57] deep research. It slows it down. They
[27:59] are finding ways in chat GPT in Gemini
[28:01] and everything to slow down the compute
[28:03] usage because there isn't enough and the
[28:06] demand is insatiable. So in this thing
[28:10] what I really they spent probably about
[28:12] a third of the video on how important
[28:15] GPT5 is. If you go into X or into all
[28:18] publications they will say GPT5
[28:21] was a disaster. The presentation was a
[28:25] disaster. There's no progress. Then you
[28:27] go listen to these guys who actually
[28:29] know everything and you just go listen
[28:31] to what they're saying. They have no
[28:32] bias towards this stuff. They're talking
[28:34] about it as users and what it can do and
[28:37] the importance of it. So, I'm not going
[28:38] to go through all of these, but I highly
[28:40] recommend whether it's on the robotic
[28:43] side, whether it's on using this to
[28:45] predict the future, possible
[28:46] applications, forecasting the S&P 500,
[28:49] predicting the future may converge with
[28:51] inventing it. That's how fast and how
[28:53] good this stuff has gotten.
[28:56] So, the next important thing, and I'm
[28:58] going to go through some of this, the
[28:59] early trickle of breakthrough is
[29:00] expected to become a title wave book
[29:02] discoveries. They said that the IQ now
[29:04] is 148. This is the level where you
[29:07] start getting into some of the benefits
[29:10] that come from recursive
[29:12] self-improvement which I talked about.
[29:14] Better optimizers train better models.
[29:17] It's an acceleration loop. So when you
[29:19] reach this point, you actually start to
[29:21] accelerate on the breakthroughs. Things
[29:23] start coming faster. AI agents happen
[29:26] faster.
[29:28] Open AI CFO revealed GPT5 rollout drove
[29:32] eight times growth in reasoning usage.
[29:36] So again when deepseek was released in
[29:39] January you got a massive growth in
[29:42] reasoning. This is one of the reasons
[29:43] why the token consumption exploded. Well
[29:47] this has 700 million users. Deepseek had
[29:50] none. So to get deepseek this was mainly
[29:53] for let's say non
[29:56] consumers sitting at home this was for
[29:57] coders this is for people who really
[29:59] understand technology pretty much now
[30:01] everyone they have however 700 million
[30:04] users uh for chat GPT it is the biggest
[30:07] one by releasing GPT5 eight times growth
[30:10] in reasoning usage demand is insatiable
[30:14] creating a positive feedback loop more
[30:16] users more productivity more economic
[30:18] output absolutely not a bubble instead
[30:20] said the biggest shift in human history.
[30:23] If you're saying AI is a bubble, you're
[30:26] missing the point. And again, Sam Alman
[30:28] said it last week and he's right. There
[30:30] is a bubble in tons of startups which
[30:33] will be zero investments. A lot of
[30:36] companies, public companies on the
[30:38] software side that have gone up to
[30:40] insane multiples. Yes, that's absolutely
[30:42] a bubble. But the power of AI, the
[30:46] profit margin benefit, the ability for
[30:48] the economy to grow, the amount of power
[30:50] needed, and how long this is going to
[30:53] take to get there. This is the very very
[30:56] early innings before robo taxis, before
[30:58] humanoids, before flying cars, before
[31:00] everything that you've ever dreamed
[31:01] about as you read about this is coming.
[31:05] So GPT brought reasoning capability
[31:08] democratization at scale. So
[31:10] democratization happened with DeepSeek
[31:13] back in January, but now at scale
[31:15] because you've got all these this is
[31:17] their choice model and they don't have
[31:19] to go in and select reasoning. It will
[31:21] do it for them based on the question
[31:23] that they asked. GPT5 is portrayed as a
[31:25] credible leap forward with higher
[31:27] intelligence of 148 consumer level
[31:29] deployment within a year predictive and
[31:30] scientific discovery capabilities and
[31:32] massive economic scaling effects. It is
[31:34] less about hype and more about
[31:36] establishing the infrastructure
[31:37] benchmarks and feedback loops for
[31:39] exponential self-improvement. Now the
[31:43] part that they did say which I'm not
[31:44] going to go through here, startups are
[31:46] structurally advantaged over incumbents.
[31:49] So it's they did talk about the fact
[31:52] that startups have a huge advantage in
[31:55] accelerating and using it while
[31:58] the public companies
[32:01] have major friction for being able to
[32:03] use it. So that's why the study found
[32:06] 95% of large company AI pilots deliver
[32:09] no financial benefit. No is just
[32:10] ridiculous. That's covered later by me
[32:12] too. Um this isn't because AI doesn't
[32:15] work. Because legacy systems, cultures,
[32:17] and bureaucracy block impact, public
[32:20] companies bound by quarterly reporting
[32:21] and entrance are structurally unable to
[32:23] adapt quickly. Public incumbents are
[32:26] wasting years and billions while AI
[32:27] native startups leapfrog them. That's
[32:30] the major story you have. And remember,
[32:33] I did a video this month about the 2030s
[32:37] being a graveyard for Fortune 500
[32:40] companies. This is the reason why and
[32:42] this is what these guys cover and that's
[32:43] what the MIT report shows. Incumbents
[32:47] are designed to fail at AI adoption
[32:49] while startups are designed to succeed.
[32:51] All companies will be disrupted by AI.
[32:55] All established companies will be
[32:57] disrupted. Doesn't matter whether it's
[33:00] law, healthcare, finance, retail, take
[33:02] your pick. They will all be disrupted
[33:04] including commodity companies,
[33:06] everything down the road because there
[33:08] will be breakthroughs
[33:10] in solutions for scarcity. Elon Musk was
[33:14] back. He continues to hype on this. Uh
[33:17] all will be wiped away by the super
[33:20] sonic to tsunami that is AI. Remember as
[33:23] you're looking at your investments in
[33:24] the fiat system, bonds have produced
[33:27] nothing for a long time. MSI World X the
[33:29] US has produced nothing over the last 18
[33:31] years. All assets have been having
[33:33] trouble except for gold, Bitcoin, and
[33:35] the Mag 7. If the Mag 7 is now going to
[33:38] run into competition as they spend their
[33:40] way into AI competition, eventually even
[33:45] the S&P 500 and stocks around the world
[33:48] will start to be debased as well.
[33:51] Another podcast if you want to listen to
[33:53] this one goes through it. um little you
[33:56] know I'm just going to read this one
[33:58] claim that 95% of AI pilots have zero
[34:00] return is unrealistic and overly
[34:02] sensational couldn't agree more bold
[34:04] statements like zero return demand very
[34:07] strong evidence which the study lacked
[34:10] hosts argue this is more about people
[34:12] wanting data to validate pre-existing
[34:14] beliefs about real evidence remember
[34:16] when eggs gave you high cholesterol
[34:21] scientific breakthrough this is from
[34:23] again the moonshots and I just want to
[34:24] bring this up as an example of how you
[34:26] can listen to these podcasts and now go
[34:28] into chatt and because it has reasoning
[34:30] models you can basically immediately
[34:32] come up with ideas on investing in at
[34:34] least get into the theme if you haven't
[34:38] seen this the researchers talked about
[34:40] on there GPT4B to tackle a key problem
[34:43] in cellular reprogramming turning mature
[34:47] cells back into stem cells that's why
[34:49] everyone needs to focus on health and uh
[34:51] right now because we are getting to the
[34:54] point where we're going to be able to
[34:56] reverse the biological clock through
[34:59] epigenetic reprogramming. So their GPT4B
[35:05] they talk about this you want to go read
[35:07] it
[35:09] they directly tied this to deis haba's
[35:12] vision using a not for apps but to solve
[35:14] science uh we're going to have bulk
[35:16] discoveries of medicine hundreds of
[35:18] protein therapies uh chronic disease
[35:21] optional aging reversible this is civil
[35:25] relational shift so when people talk
[35:26] about whether CPI is going to be 3.5 or
[35:28] 3.1 just read this What's more
[35:31] important? It is moronic to talk about
[35:34] inflation at 3.5 or 3 or 3.1%. It just
[35:39] has nothing to do with three years from
[35:41] now when we're talking about where we
[35:42] are in this kind of stuff. But if you
[35:44] want to focus on the on the investing
[35:46] side, the longevity industry, one
[35:48] speculative is being transformed into a
[35:50] near-term investable theme by AI
[35:52] breakthroughs like chat GPTB.
[35:56] Now what I did capital will flow into
[36:00] this AO biotech hybrids companies at the
[36:02] intersection found. So this was a line
[36:04] that they had in there. So I wanted to
[36:06] find out okay let me paste it in there
[36:08] and find out the companies that would
[36:10] benefit private company private company
[36:13] private company private company. These
[36:15] are the companies it listed as the best
[36:17] ones to focus on relative
[36:20] to what GPT4B
[36:23] means.
[36:25] Okay. how biotech hybrids went in there.
[36:27] So next question, will this help or
[36:28] disrupt the existing public pharma
[36:30] companies threats to incumbents? So you
[36:32] can go through how it will help.
[36:39] Now I go through and get me specifics on
[36:41] which ones.
[36:44] In summary, AI biotech hybrids are a
[36:47] double-edged sword for public pharma.
[36:48] They help in the short term pipeline
[36:50] expansion faster R&D, but in the medium
[36:52] to long run, they disrupt the moat by
[36:54] democratizing discovery and attacking
[36:56] chronic disease revenue streams. This
[36:57] supports your broader thesis. Within 5
[36:59] years, all established public companies,
[37:01] including pharma, will be disrupted by
[37:03] AI and Pharma may be one of the
[37:05] earliest, clearest cases.
[37:10] Tesla, uh, again, I released that report
[37:14] 22V. If you guys are Tesla fans, uh it's
[37:17] a long form report on why the robo taxi
[37:19] right now is the most important thing
[37:21] going on for the gateway for humanoids.
[37:24] The faster that there's acceleration
[37:26] from Tesla on this. Since they've made
[37:27] the bet, which again is here, they've
[37:30] moved away from motion camera suits and
[37:32] VR headsets to collect data. They will
[37:35] primarily focus on recording videos of
[37:36] workers performing tasks to teach the
[37:38] robot through videos.
[37:41] This is meant to scale data collection
[37:43] more quickly in his belief that AI can
[37:46] learn complex tasks through cameras, the
[37:48] same playbook behind Tesla's
[37:50] self-driving tech. It comes soon after
[37:53] optimist director stepped down with AI
[37:55] chief now leading the program. So again,
[37:59] important to pay attention. Bitcoin down
[38:02] for the month. It's crashing. Everyone's
[38:05] worried. We're down to 108 and change as
[38:07] we do this. Who knows, by Monday it
[38:09] could be 101. Uh this is after four
[38:12] months in a row, just to give you some
[38:14] kind of idea. Uh the last time it went
[38:17] up five times in a row was back in 2020
[38:20] in 2021. So it really has a hard time
[38:23] extending for long periods. It gets a
[38:25] big run. We get lots of the uh old
[38:28] holders that have been in there for a
[38:30] long time that are billionaires selling
[38:31] out of some of them. Uh it also tends to
[38:34] have trouble uh as it did in here
[38:38] when China stock market's doing well. Uh
[38:41] there's a lot of Chinese family offices
[38:44] that are in Bitcoin and when the stock
[38:46] market by the government is basically
[38:48] free money to go higher and it's going
[38:49] higher at a faster pace than Bitcoin. We
[38:52] did see a lot of family offices that
[38:54] were rotating out back then. I think
[38:56] that may have been some of this in a in
[38:57] a quiet uh August, but the reality is
[38:59] Bitcoin
[39:01] continues to
[39:04] be fine. Uh Goldman Sachs released a
[39:07] report on stable coins. This is my big
[39:10] theme behind the digital economy
[39:12] acceleration. The merging of AI agents
[39:14] and stable coin being adopted as the
[39:17] transaction choice uh around the globe
[39:20] could reach trillions of dollars. If you
[39:22] want to go read the report or go through
[39:24] it, top of mind, stable coin summer,
[39:26] it's on
[39:28] the web. Uh, genius was just a prologue.
[39:31] Stable coins represent a platform shift
[39:33] in payments. The stage is set more and
[39:35] more stuff as everyone is accepting it.
[39:39] And then finally this week, the
[39:41] Department of Commerce is going to start
[39:42] issuing its statistics on blockchain
[39:44] because you're the crypto president and
[39:47] we are going to put out GDP on the
[39:48] blockchain so people can use blockchain
[39:50] for data distribution. All right, that's
[39:52] it for the summertime. Uh that's it for
[39:54] me in Maine recording. Next week I'll be
[39:56] back in uh in New York in Brooklyn. Uh
[39:59] for those of you attending the event, uh
[40:02] I will be speaking at uh Palms event in
[40:07] September. I'll also be with John Ro out
[40:10] in Vegas at the Robin Hood event and I'm
[40:13] doing a lot of other things in uh in New
[40:15] York. I look forward to getting to see
[40:17] everyone. Uh, hit that subscribe button
[40:20] and I will see you guys uh after Labor
[40:22] Day.
