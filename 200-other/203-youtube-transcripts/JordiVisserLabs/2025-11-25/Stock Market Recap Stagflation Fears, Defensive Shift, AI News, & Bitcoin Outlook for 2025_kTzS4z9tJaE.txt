[00:00] holiday shortened week uh volumes were
[00:03] down significantly for most of the week
[00:05] but uh there's a lot of news and there
[00:08] was a lot of uh price action
[00:11] that is going to uh lead me to kind of
[00:15] take you through back on regime shifts
[00:18] which I talked about in December uh
[00:20] there's more relevance as to what the
[00:23] regime is and that's the first point
[00:25] here is it's clear that at this point
[00:27] stagflation has entered and I think
[00:29] that's going to be the regime for the
[00:30] near term uh because of the fact that
[00:33] any inflation data that goes higher uh
[00:35] which I think is likely because of the
[00:39] the commodity side uh but also because
[00:42] growth is a worry uh part of it is
[00:46] because of what doge is doing and
[00:49] cutting spending part of it is the AI
[00:51] side and I think what's going to
[00:53] continue to show up
[00:54] is weakish uh Labor uh and at the same
[00:59] time with the tariffs sitting out there
[01:01] when they happen they kind of fit into
[01:03] both camps so I'll go through that uh
[01:05] momentum stocks had a big fall that is
[01:07] usually a turning sign and this time
[01:09] when they fell uh it feeds into the
[01:11] third part which is I'm going to go
[01:12] through the equal weight equal weight
[01:14] pairs which have finally uh been
[01:18] breaking down uh this week they broke
[01:20] down and I'll show you those uh a very
[01:23] good leading indicator for the S&P 500
[01:26] uh grock 3 came out big deal uh I used
[01:29] it all week uh it has supplanted some of
[01:31] the AI work that I was doing on
[01:34] perplexity uh and Claude uh this just
[01:37] continues to stair step in terms of AI
[01:40] very big week for humanoids I'll go
[01:41] through that and then there was a crypto
[01:43] hack so crypto just continues to
[01:45] have uh what I would consider to be bad
[01:48] news coming out uh and I'll kind of go
[01:51] through the charts there on both the
[01:52] crypto Universe X Bitcoin and Bitcoin uh
[01:55] just for the week S&P down 1.66% the
[01:59] thing that stands out you got utilities
[02:00] Healthcare energy Staples basically the
[02:03] defensives plus energy on the inflation
[02:06] side outperforming and all of the
[02:09] negatives are related to growth so again
[02:12] immediately think stagflation uh not
[02:15] inflation and not a recession but
[02:17] stagflation so slowing growth at the
[02:19] same time that inflation is going higher
[02:21] uh year-to date same story Staples
[02:24] Healthcare utilities energy you've got
[02:26] financials up here but you have the
[02:28] growth related names which are down here
[02:29] here including
[02:31] technology uh remember I I did I showed
[02:35] a regime shift warning uh back in
[02:38] December this was December 15th when I
[02:40] did this video and I showed how momentum
[02:43] had gotten hit and this historically
[02:46] leads to the probability of regime shift
[02:49] I now think we've confirmed the regime
[02:50] shift because we have a story for it and
[02:52] once you get a story for it then people
[02:54] can start to uh be scared about it so
[02:58] Steve Cohen came out this week and
[03:00] basically said exactly kind of that part
[03:04] which
[03:04] is we're going to see growth so the
[03:07] second tariffs tighter immigration which
[03:09] people expect to have an impact on uh
[03:13] Unemployment uh the law uh the
[03:16] government cost cutting by Elon Musk and
[03:19] the Tariff so you have people starting
[03:21] to talk about it and again Sticky
[03:23] inflation I agree with slowing growth
[03:25] just not accelerating growth and I think
[03:27] that's what people were positioned for
[03:29] people got position for uh inflation
[03:32] going higher but on cyclical growth
[03:34] which we've seen in the PMI but now the
[03:36] fear has shifted to the Slowdown and I
[03:38] had talked about the Dilemma the FED
[03:40] would probably have this year because I
[03:41] thought the labor market would be on the
[03:43] weaker side now what they've thrown in
[03:45] is that doge is going to be more
[03:46] successful but if you're going to cut
[03:49] some if you're going to cut hundreds of
[03:50] billions of dollars from spending it
[03:53] will have an impact on the economy if
[03:55] you're going to fire hundreds of
[03:57] thousands of employees or let's assume
[03:59] more than 100,000 employees uh it's
[04:02] going to have an impact on the claims
[04:03] and I think that'll just keep things on
[04:04] the software side so you started to get
[04:06] the news items towards the middle week
[04:08] um this is before the the Friday
[04:10] movement but stagflation is poised for a
[04:13] comeback and remember I highlighted this
[04:15] last week this was last week started
[04:17] this whole thing off in terms of the
[04:21] regime and I just want to emphasize
[04:22] again uh as I go through this I do not
[04:25] think any chance of recession nothing
[04:27] has changed there uh unless they somehow
[04:29] another do tariffs very aggressively and
[04:32] at the same time cut spending very
[04:34] aggressively otherwise I think this is
[04:36] going to be a battle where AI will
[04:39] continue to make profit margins good the
[04:42] stock market will change and what we've
[04:44] had is companies like paler companies
[04:46] like Walmart companies that are trading
[04:48] at whatever pees wanted where we haven't
[04:51] had a correction now we're in a
[04:52] different regime this regime is where we
[04:55] have growth slowing so the probability
[04:57] of recession by definition goes higher
[04:59] and we have have inflation at 30-year
[05:03] highs X for a month over Monon number
[05:05] covid which increases uh the probability
[05:08] that the FED could raise rates and again
[05:10] I don't think either of those things are
[05:11] going to happen but the the market is
[05:13] about how they were positioned and they
[05:14] were positioned for growth to accelerate
[05:17] while inflation stayed down or continued
[05:19] to Trend lower here's the Philly fed uh
[05:22] prices paid and this is not just about
[05:24] this number which gets you back to the
[05:26] 2022 levels October 2022 it's more about
[05:29] you can see how this is trending higher
[05:31] we're done with the disinflationary or
[05:34] the inflation heading back scenario at
[05:37] this point you've got too many data
[05:39] points that are coming out and again it
[05:41] doesn't mean we're going back in terms
[05:43] of the CPI levels back up there but
[05:45] since the commodity stuff is heading
[05:48] higher at this point a 4% inflation at
[05:51] some point this year year-over-year is a
[05:53] good possibility here's the one-year
[05:56] Umesh one-year expectations of inflation
[05:58] up to 3 and a half% % this is the
[06:00] highest level in 30 years uh so you've
[06:02] got expectations moving higher and then
[06:04] even the fed this is uh the number of
[06:08] participants uh the yellow line here is
[06:11] worried about the unemployment rate uh
[06:14] in terms of it going higher so that's
[06:16] come down but on the inflation side RIS
[06:18] to core pce it's also at the highest
[06:20] level since back in Q4 of 2022 so you're
[06:24] getting all kinds of stuff on that side
[06:26] and then the market has been building it
[06:28] in and I showed this chart last week
[06:29] continued this week it's actually
[06:31] accelerated we broke through
[06:32] 4% uh on one year so these are break
[06:36] evens for tips uh you're up at 4% in
[06:38] terms of one-year expectations you have
[06:40] the the 2-year uh up at over 3% at about
[06:45] 320 and again that's higher than any
[06:47] point since this little Spike here in
[06:50] March of 23 when we were still
[06:51] technically in it uh so you've got this
[06:54] going higher here two-year break even
[06:57] showing that chart a little bit closer
[06:59] and just heading back up there what it
[07:01] has done and what I tweeted about this
[07:04] week um when you're looking for reasons
[07:06] that the dollar is coming
[07:08] down uh this has been the relationship
[07:11] between real two-year yields and we
[07:12] haven't talked about real two two-year
[07:14] yields in a while but the FED is on hold
[07:17] so as uh inflation expectations are
[07:20] moving higher we're not moving two-year
[07:22] rates higher so you're seeing real rates
[07:24] come down and so at this point now the
[07:26] dollar has followed this and this is why
[07:28] at this point point when we had this
[07:30] going on we expected inflation to go
[07:32] higher with growth if you have inflation
[07:33] going higher without growth well that's
[07:36] a difficult situation and that's where
[07:38] you end up where people start
[07:39] questioning the views they had uh that
[07:41] is a momentum trade that has been
[07:43] trending the other way in terms of a
[07:45] strong dollar has now turned into a
[07:46] weaker dollar another Trend uh you've
[07:48] got rates that have come down and again
[07:50] I've highlighted the fact that we have a
[07:52] uh you know a ma weekly sell signal we
[07:55] had a little upward move but with
[07:56] inflation coming down the market is
[07:58] getting out of the position ing that had
[08:00] been expecting inflation to go higher
[08:02] but with growth going higher As Trump
[08:04] took over so that's the big thing that
[08:06] has shifted we got economic data this
[08:08] week and I think this stuff starts to
[08:10] tell a situation that feeds into the
[08:11] Tariff argument that I've made which is
[08:14] this is the unemployment rate this is
[08:15] the 10mon average of it um it's inverted
[08:19] so the unemployment rate is still very
[08:21] much at very good levels at the same
[08:24] time you have stock ownership this is
[08:26] the Umesh sentiment number so stock
[08:28] ownership is up here so so it says
[08:30] people have owned a lot of stocks and
[08:31] we've seen the stock market go up
[08:33] significantly but this is the
[08:34] expectation of their financials one year
[08:37] out so you're getting a huge disconnect
[08:39] right now where people are just
[08:41] not happy with where they are I think
[08:44] that is the job situation I think that
[08:46] is the inflation situation uh and I
[08:49] think we're left with a scenario that
[08:50] people just don't think they can get an
[08:51] increase in wages of any meaningful
[08:53] number and the cost for everything in
[08:56] their lives just remains on the high
[08:58] side and they keep getting hit by things
[09:00] whether it's Insurance on car whether
[09:01] it's uh food at at the supermarket every
[09:04] time there's a little uptick it starts
[09:06] to have sensitivity so I've shown this
[09:08] chart before inflation expectations last
[09:10] week again this is through the 210 swap
[09:13] curve for inflation um again they're up
[09:16] at these levels and here's what the
[09:17] chart looks like of the mag 7 the mag 7
[09:19] is now uh down for the year and it has
[09:24] the look of a topping formation and
[09:26] again I bring this up I had these two
[09:28] lines in here because this is when the
[09:30] fed pivoted and said they were focused
[09:32] on inflation and then this is where they
[09:34] pivoted the other way so this is the end
[09:36] of transitory uh and this and they're
[09:38] going to start fighting it and you saw
[09:40] what happened to this if inflation is
[09:42] more than sticky the risk of this
[09:46] happening has gone up uh and that's just
[09:49] the issue that comes up I don't think
[09:50] you're going to see inflation get to
[09:52] those levels but again people were
[09:53] positioned for disinflation and growth
[09:56] and that's not happening and so momentum
[09:58] starts to shift this is the weekly
[10:01] momentum so remember I highlighted in
[10:02] December you had some big days but there
[10:05] weren't big weeks this is the biggest
[10:06] week since the pivot week um and again
[10:11] you start going through this you start
[10:12] recognizing that okay we start getting
[10:15] these big weekly shifts that means that
[10:17] people are positioned the wrong way for
[10:18] the macro environment and that's what I
[10:20] think has occurred uh I'm I'm
[10:23] highlighting this it was you had two big
[10:25] down days in a row you had you know a
[10:27] whole week was down every day okay but
[10:30] these two days this is the one that
[10:32] happened in January uh this was deep
[10:35] seek so you had the tech side that had
[10:37] gone out and all the trades the power
[10:38] trade I bring this up because momentum
[10:41] takes time to shift the other direction
[10:43] but as hedge funds start losing money
[10:45] and those are the ones that start going
[10:47] in as Quant strategies start
[10:48] repositioning because of new macro news
[10:51] you will get a shift a regime is about a
[10:54] macro change it forces Quant strategies
[10:57] that use things like the dollar that use
[10:59] things like real 2u rates that use
[11:01] things like Commodities when you have
[11:02] the inflationary side trending then you
[11:05] start to get shifts the other way and
[11:07] that's what's happening in my opinion
[11:08] but also there's an expectation by
[11:10] discretionary people that growth could
[11:13] be at risk because of what's happening
[11:15] so anything that makes this worse you're
[11:17] going to continue to see pressure on
[11:19] this at a minimum when you've seen these
[11:21] three this is the one in December when I
[11:23] when I highlighted it the first time
[11:25] you're obviously also getting a change
[11:27] in volatility so this is the six day V
[11:30] for momentum uh aside from this period
[11:33] in in 2022 and again this is the Pivot
[11:36] Point by the fed you get a pivot you get
[11:38] a massive change involve because
[11:41] everyone needs to reposition their
[11:42] portfolios remember a pure momentum
[11:44] factor is Market neutral it is sector
[11:47] neutralized so this is really an
[11:50] important move when you start seeing a
[11:51] shift in volatility that means you're
[11:54] starting to get people that are bailing
[11:55] out of things that have worked for a
[11:56] while and again I use paler as an
[11:58] example if you look at that that chart I
[11:59] bring Walmart up these were Darlings
[12:01] that retail and everyone could stay long
[12:03] there was no reason to get out of them
[12:05] well we just saw big big moves the other
[12:07] direction um and what it led to and this
[12:09] is sector momentum so this is
[12:11] highlighting this one here the blue one
[12:13] is a TMT so the technology side went
[12:16] down Healthcare had already been in this
[12:18] I've shown this repeatedly this is pure
[12:20] momentum which is still lagging behind
[12:22] but the trend is there and I bring it up
[12:24] because I would not be surprised if this
[12:26] cont this rotation should happen but it
[12:29] needs a macro context needs a story uh
[12:33] and that's the one thing I've learned is
[12:34] that from a risk management basis you
[12:36] want to hear this stuff because you want
[12:37] to look for changes this is the way it
[12:39] fits into the bigger picture so I
[12:41] mentioned these equal weight pairs this
[12:43] is the S&P equal weight consumer
[12:46] discretionary relative to the equal
[12:48] weight Consumer Staples so it takes the
[12:51] cap side out which makes it a much
[12:53] better indicator for what's happening
[12:54] both at the Quant level but really it's
[12:57] the best indicator in my opinion or one
[12:58] of the best ones uh and I'll show you
[13:00] another one as we go through this for
[13:02] the economy and expectations on it so
[13:05] this is it overlaid with momentum so
[13:08] again when people start getting out of
[13:10] cyclical and they start getting into
[13:12] defensives or into Staples so this is
[13:14] consumer discretionary versus Consumer
[13:16] Staples one of the most important ones
[13:18] that's a sharp move and they move
[13:19] together that means it's being driven
[13:21] momentum By changes in the economy so
[13:23] from a macro basis you're getting the
[13:25] signal this is the daily move we had the
[13:28] biggest I'm sorry weekly move we had the
[13:30] biggest weekly move drop in the
[13:32] equal consumer discretionary vers
[13:35] Consumer Staples since all the way back
[13:37] in 2020 so you have to think about it we
[13:39] had negative real GDP here but that was
[13:43] with high nominal GDP we now have
[13:45] nominal GDP around 4 and 1 half to
[13:48] 5% with inflation heading back or
[13:51] appearing to head back to four that's a
[13:53] very different scenario than having 12%
[13:56] nominal GDP and inflation going up to or
[13:59] 10 and seeing a negative print so that's
[14:01] why you're getting this massive shock
[14:04] that takes us back there but you can
[14:05] also see how many weeks in a row we had
[14:08] had a big move so this was a very
[14:10] crowded position very important to
[14:12] monitor because I do think the it has
[14:14] changed and just to show how correlated
[14:16] it is to the S&P this is the S&P since
[14:18] the lows in March of
[14:20] 2020 I haven't highlighted this because
[14:23] there was really no reason but whenever
[14:24] the S&P has had a mini correction here
[14:26] this has made new highs so it hasn't
[14:28] bothered me at all it's one of the
[14:29] reasons why I look at this but what you
[14:33] can see is this is a sharp fall that's
[14:36] equivalent to the S&P of about another 5
[14:39] to 6% fall uh we'll see what happens on
[14:42] this I think this is more about a
[14:44] rotation but the risk of a bigger
[14:46] correction in the S&P is there because
[14:48] as hedge funds are losing money they
[14:51] will be repositioning and they will buy
[14:53] puts on the S&P that is just the the
[14:56] normal thing people try to stop paying
[14:59] and it causes markets to go down on
[15:00] almost any rotation I've ever seen um
[15:03] this is just highlighting how it leads
[15:06] so this is how it led the peak in 21
[15:09] this is the transitory time and the S&P
[15:11] eventually followed it down and again
[15:13] the white line here is the equal weight
[15:15] um consumer discretionary verse uh
[15:18] Consumer Staples so uh I just want to
[15:21] show that now we have a macd these
[15:23] weekly macd cell signals have been
[15:25] working very well uh most of them uh
[15:29] some of you know you're you're you're
[15:30] getting a lot of long-term Trend changes
[15:32] right now and I think with the momentum
[15:34] side already showing on rates already
[15:35] showing on the dollar uh showing on S&P
[15:38] versus the Dax a lot of different trades
[15:40] China versus uh Mega capex you've had a
[15:43] lot of what I would considered to be
[15:45] more value related trades and that's
[15:47] what I think this rotation is more about
[15:49] but you have to pay attention that when
[15:50] stagflation becomes a story we've left
[15:53] the world of higher growth inflation
[15:55] trending lower and now we're at a point
[15:56] where inflation it's going higher
[15:59] sticky but trending higher and growth
[16:01] I'm a little bit more worried based on
[16:03] the policies that I'm seeing uh where
[16:05] people were positioned for PR growth
[16:07] story so that's the shift that's
[16:08] happened you can see this sharp move
[16:10] lower we're right at the 20we moving
[16:12] average uh we'll see if we continue on
[16:15] this but I think we've got enough on
[16:17] that to signal that there could be some
[16:18] risk this is another way to look at it
[16:20] this is another equal weight pair so
[16:22] this is the equal weight cyclicals
[16:24] versus
[16:25] defensive so similar to Consumer
[16:28] discretionary versus this another big
[16:30] move lower much bigger in terms of
[16:32] relative to the move so it gave up
[16:34] everything uh back to October uh back to
[16:37] the election when we had gone higher uh
[16:39] and basically in one day and again
[16:41] leading indicator it led here in the
[16:44] same way so you've got all these pairs
[16:46] on the equal weight side which uh
[16:48] suggest it and then on this one little
[16:50] worse of a weekly macd setup you've got
[16:52] lower macds and higher prices so you've
[16:55] got these divergences so uh everything
[16:57] looks to me like we're going to get uh
[16:59] some kind of a shift and it comes at a
[17:01] time where we've been seeing again cash
[17:03] levels go down I never care about the
[17:05] level I mean you could have said it was
[17:06] low here you could have said it was low
[17:07] here but what you want to look for is
[17:09] warning signs that are happening so we
[17:11] have low cash levels which means we
[17:13] don't have people fearful at the same
[17:15] time that we're seeing the internals and
[17:16] the market change it comes at a time
[17:19] where everyone wants to talk about how
[17:20] expensive it is I don't buy into this in
[17:23] terms of this with the profit margins
[17:24] are at all-time highs as I've shown
[17:26] that's why I don't worry about the
[17:27] market uh but you want to in a position
[17:29] where you can take advantage of people
[17:31] getting short and bearish uh and they
[17:33] have enough of a story so you look for
[17:34] where the stories could be delinquencies
[17:37] we've got delinquencies that have been
[17:38] trending higher since 2022 you've got a
[17:41] lot of people the median voter but
[17:42] definitely the bottom end which has been
[17:44] suffering and they're suffering because
[17:45] rates have gone higher now with
[17:47] inflation going higher uh you have that
[17:49] problem and I just think the wage
[17:50] problem or at least the problem with the
[17:52] job situation is going to remain on the
[17:54] softer side the good news is as I showed
[17:56] last week the AI uh retail survey is
[18:01] it's low so sentiment is already
[18:03] negative uh for Traders um just just
[18:06] highlights that we're at 40% Bears um
[18:10] normally you're at 31% the Bulls are at
[18:13] 29 a high level is 52 so we're really
[18:16] extreme in terms of the sentiment side
[18:18] um I just want to keep reiterating that
[18:21] the Tariff side to me is going to end up
[18:25] if he does tariffs um at a time when
[18:27] we've got this stagl fear I think it's
[18:29] going to have an impact on the market um
[18:32] it's one thing to do it at a time when
[18:34] there's none of this going on and people
[18:36] don't have to worry but as I said last
[18:37] week he paused them and I think one of
[18:39] the reasons that he paused them because
[18:41] he clearly really wants to do them is
[18:43] because of the fact that inflation was
[18:45] higher well if the market is going lower
[18:47] the reason I wanted to bring this up
[18:50] here is the income tax side these are
[18:51] the duties collected on steel and
[18:53] aluminum from 2018 to 2024 this is from
[18:57] Apollo and the reason this is so
[19:00] important is because the $3 trillion of
[19:03] personal and corporate income
[19:05] tax a lot of that has to do with the S&P
[19:08] 500 as I showed last week so if S&P 500
[19:10] goes down uh it's a much bigger number
[19:13] the S&P 500 is far bigger so when you're
[19:16] doing the calculation on what Doge can
[19:18] get away with and with what tariffs can
[19:20] G the assumption is that we raise
[19:22] tariffs and everything stays the same
[19:24] the revenue side is much more volatile
[19:27] than people give it credit for because
[19:28] if you have a scenario the stock market
[19:30] goes down I just don't think it's going
[19:32] to go so it weakens his ability to be
[19:34] too aggressive on tariffs which will be
[19:36] a positive at some point this year so I
[19:38] differ with Steve Cohen I'm less worried
[19:40] about the tariffs in the second half of
[19:41] the year I think right now we're getting
[19:42] a lot of warning signs that people are
[19:44] going to reposition uh I think it's a
[19:46] rotation I don't think you're going to
[19:47] see a big correction I think if it is
[19:49] it's kind of one of these rolling tops
[19:51] it's very difficult to trade we could
[19:52] even make new highs during it uh on the
[19:54] rotation but I think it's going to be
[19:56] challenging one of the most important
[19:57] things for next week we have Nvidia
[19:59] earnings obviously Nvidia has there the
[20:02] the fear of Nvidia on the back of deep
[20:04] seek makes this earnings report a lot uh
[20:06] a lot more important than uh prior ones
[20:09] so that could change everything for at
[20:11] least a bounce in terms of AI grock 3
[20:14] came out if you haven't used it I'll say
[20:15] the same thing um that I did it's free
[20:18] for now uh I would highly recommend
[20:20] using it because if you don't pay for
[20:22] the $20 for chat gbt you're going to
[20:25] notice a dramatic difference with grock
[20:27] 3 because grock 3 is more equivalent to
[20:29] the higher end ones so you get to try
[20:31] something that is free which is much
[20:35] much faster than anything in terms of
[20:37] perplexity uh or anything that goes
[20:39] through so you can see the numbers I
[20:40] bring this up because you got deep seek
[20:42] they jumped to one then open eye came
[20:44] out with their next one they jumped
[20:45] ahead now grock is the speed of AI
[20:47] change just continues to grow and in the
[20:50] same way that we saw that deep seek was
[20:51] at the top of apps uh well look what's
[20:54] gone down now um deep seek is number
[20:57] four grock is number one chat GPT is
[20:59] number two so uh even the argument that
[21:01] deep seek would would change everything
[21:03] on uh Nvidia is not there and that's why
[21:05] I wanted to bring up this for those of
[21:07] you who don't know um grock 3 is powered
[21:10] by Colossus uh this is uh an amazing
[21:14] story Alon mus built this in I think
[21:16] aund yeah uh 122 days uh he expanded it
[21:21] over 92 days to get it to 200,000 gpus
[21:25] so anyone who was saying that what deep
[21:27] seek would do is stop the capex Ben what
[21:29] he has proven with grock 3 is that more
[21:33] power and more compute does mean faster
[21:36] better everything and he did this in a
[21:38] short amount of time so uh I just
[21:41] wouldn't uh underestimate how much more
[21:43] we're going to be dealing with in terms
[21:45] of the compute side so in vinia at least
[21:47] for the next two years uh the stock
[21:50] could have uh it's going to have less
[21:53] multiple expansion in my point but I
[21:55] think the demand side's going to be
[21:57] there so it'll be a good indicator not
[21:58] of whether they're going to have make be
[22:00] able to go up 100% a year anymore that I
[22:03] highly doubt is going to happen but I do
[22:05] think they can certainly grow their
[22:07] earnings at a time where their pees have
[22:09] already compressed over the last seven
[22:11] months because remember their stock is
[22:13] basically unchanged since June July of
[22:15] last year U Microsoft made a huge
[22:17] advancement in Quantum Computing
[22:19] breakthrough go read about that um uh
[22:23] Microsoft announced and open AI did that
[22:25] GPT 5 is coming out soon and GPT 4 and a
[22:28] half could arrive as soon as next week
[22:30] so again we're continuing to see the Lea
[22:32] frogging of all of this um I paid for
[22:34] open AI deep research so I jumped into
[22:36] the $200 a month club uh amazing I I
[22:40] used I've used it probably uh 12 or 13
[22:43] hours this week uh grock 3 has been my
[22:46] dominant thing so I've spent a lot of
[22:47] time on AI this week building some stuff
[22:49] it's absolutely amazing a lot of
[22:51] advancements on the biology side again
[22:53] so for longevity and all these things
[22:56] longevity is a massively bullish thing
[22:58] it's something that will continue to be
[23:00] there we're going to have tremendous
[23:01] amounts of drugs that come out uh Google
[23:03] announced something in terms of
[23:05] discovering their AI agent a new
[23:07] leukemia drug then successfully tested
[23:09] in vitro at clinical concentration so
[23:12] independently discovered we're getting
[23:13] AI agents to make discoveries anthropic
[23:16] is coming out with a reasoning uh uh
[23:19] model uh very it said within a few weeks
[23:22] so you're going to have claws stepping
[23:24] up or anthropic stepping up if you guys
[23:26] haven't read this um on the arc
[23:29] Institute uh this came out this week in
[23:32] collaboration with Nvidia can now model
[23:34] and design the genetic code for all
[23:35] domains of life with ev2 if you're
[23:37] interested in it the all in podcast did
[23:39] about a half hour on it amazingly
[23:42] interesting in terms of what's what's
[23:44] coming uh and taking it from a different
[23:47] perspective of alpha fold and some of
[23:48] the stem cell side so highly recommend
[23:51] spending the time on it again not an
[23:53] investment theme other than from a macro
[23:55] basis it's very bullish for stocks it's
[23:57] very bullish for everything because
[23:59] longevity is just a massively bullish um
[24:02] theme in terms of reduction of cost and
[24:04] reduction of wasted spending on
[24:06] Healthcare so you're going to see that
[24:07] change uh Alon musk said this week on a
[24:11] panel the biggest Roi from AI will be
[24:13] humanoid robot so I've talked a lot
[24:15] about humanoids I'm going to keep doing
[24:16] it because I think this is the year I
[24:18] thought it was the year that they would
[24:19] become a market moving event and I think
[24:22] we're getting to that point now um Brett
[24:25] Adcock from figure AI uh uh basically
[24:30] introduced Helix um if you haven't
[24:33] watched these videos I mean these are
[24:34] two robots that are working in the
[24:36] kitchen together you should go watch the
[24:37] video you can go to his tweet there and
[24:40] and get it um basically that
[24:45] company is in talks to raise 1.5 billion
[24:50] that would be 15 times its last round so
[24:54] 15 times higher than figure ai's 2.6
[24:57] billion post money value valuation last
[24:59] year so you're talking about massive
[25:02] valuation jumps and I just want you to
[25:04] again you go back to awn mus convers
[25:06] what he said and he also said it would
[25:08] be A1 trillion doll opportunity you've
[25:11] had people investors say uh Tesla would
[25:14] be A1 trillion company because of
[25:17] humanoids by
[25:18] 2030 I'm just going to bring up now the
[25:21] other ones and all of these you can go
[25:22] watch this is the unry one selling for
[25:25] 16,000 this is uh China
[25:28] Norway had and these is all this week so
[25:31] this is all videos and stuff that came
[25:33] out this week obviously people looking
[25:34] for funding and more money it's going to
[25:36] take a lot of money uh for these things
[25:38] because they're not cheap to build this
[25:40] is a Norwegian robotics firm so we
[25:41] showed a us one we've shown a China One
[25:43] now we've got a nor or Norwegian one uh
[25:46] unveiled its latest home Robo Neo Neo uh
[25:50] which is for the home you can go watch
[25:52] that video also on
[25:53] Twitter you've got protocone created by
[25:56] a a Polish startup uh robotics one this
[25:59] was came out this week in terms of
[26:01] showing it uh just going back to the AI
[26:05] went back to last one so that's the the
[26:07] message that we've got on humanoids um I
[26:09] wanted to finish up I didn't really want
[26:11] to spend too much time uh on bitcoin
[26:14] this week given the fact that we
[26:16] remained stuck in this range we've been
[26:18] in this range we had broken out briefly
[26:20] and looked like all the stuff was
[26:22] starting to Trend higher and then all of
[26:24] a sudden we had uh a hack uh which I'll
[26:28] get into in a second but one of the
[26:29] things I did want to show with Bitcoin
[26:31] sitting in this range we're really
[26:33] seeing a decline in volatility and I
[26:34] think that's one of the things that that
[26:36] um is happening as Michael sailor
[26:38] continues to do another ISS which he did
[26:40] this week uh it's not you're starting to
[26:43] see the volatility of Bitcoin come down
[26:45] so as volatility and we're having hacks
[26:47] and we're having uh meme coins and all
[26:49] this stuff going on volatility on
[26:51] bitcoin is just dropping so you're
[26:53] getting down to low levels this is on
[26:55] ibit so this is the the ey share this
[26:57] will give in institutions much more
[26:59] comfort that it can handle these days
[27:01] where you have this really negative news
[27:03] so this is the uh the hack $ 1.4 billion
[27:07] worth of ethereum on bibit uh so that
[27:11] happened this week it was announced that
[27:13] we had record breaking token Creation in
[27:15] January so think of it as we had record
[27:18] record IPOs uh which again draining
[27:22] altcoin liquidity
[27:25] uh then you've got the meme coins from
[27:28] from both Trump and for Malay which
[27:31] ended up being a big negative and with
[27:33] all of that going on here's what's
[27:35] happened so this is the overlay of the
[27:37] market cap of crypto X Bitcoin relative
[27:40] to bitcoin so
[27:42] again it's basically in this case the
[27:44] all the crypto Market is unchanged since
[27:48] March of last year so you're almost at
[27:51] the point where it's unchanged since
[27:52] there at the same time Bitcoin Has
[27:55] outperformed It by 66% so Bitcoin since
[27:58] point is up about 70% and the rest of
[28:02] the market in crypto X Bitcoin so you're
[28:05] starting to get a separation from
[28:06] Bitcoin and I've said repeatedly the two
[28:09] things I'm interested in this is where
[28:11] we segue into the last part I am a big
[28:13] believer that this year is the network
[28:15] effects Year we will have the
[28:17] administration helping Network effects
[28:19] will bring more money into the ecosystem
[28:21] I just focus on the trading side you
[28:23] have some of the technology with things
[28:25] like salana and ethereum andu included
[28:27] in the crypto market cap cap the altcoin
[28:29] the the meme coins have been destroyed
[28:31] and a lot of the Lesser valued alt coins
[28:33] have so anyone was expecting this to be
[28:35] a massive altcoin year if you're not
[28:37] going to have momentum in technology I
[28:39] just don't see this being as big a
[28:42] altcoin year as people thought but I do
[28:43] think this is a big Bitcoin year and the
[28:45] reason is because I think the ecosystem
[28:47] of stable coins this is the stable coin
[28:49] chart so remember as Bitcoin uh and as
[28:52] the alt coins were going
[28:54] down you've had a rally that's gone up
[28:57] last year we had sideways action in
[28:59] Bitcoin throughout here and stable coins
[29:01] went sideways well stable coins May are
[29:03] making new highs and I think this is uh
[29:06] becoming the most important story and
[29:09] one of the reasons is the stable coin uh
[29:11] bill is what they're working on now so
[29:13] everyone had been focused on a Bitcoin a
[29:15] strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh I just
[29:18] don't expect there to be any kind of
[29:19] announcement on that I think as I said
[29:21] last week you'll get corporate adoption
[29:23] you're going to get um institutional
[29:24] adoption but I think stable coin
[29:26] regulation is going to continue to bring
[29:28] more wallets more money in there and I
[29:30] think the volumes are going to be large
[29:32] so the stable coin regulation is
[29:34] important for Bitcoin it's important for
[29:35] the entire crypto Market but I think
[29:37] people should be spending more time on
[29:39] it I'm going to do a long form piece
[29:41] written piece in substack if people are
[29:42] interested uh very soon uh but you can
[29:46] go through the reasons why uh there's
[29:48] just a lot more stories on it uh all in
[29:50] podcast back in October I did a short
[29:54] video the only short video I've done to
[29:56] talk about the importance of stable coin
[29:58] future with stripe buying Bridge well
[30:00] they had the stripe Brothers on who run
[30:03] the company uh good to listen to I would
[30:06] go listen to it it was on the Allin
[30:07] podcast at the very beginning they talk
[30:09] about stable coins uh AI Development
[30:11] I've talked about agents this is going
[30:12] to lead to much more volumes with inside
[30:14] stable coin because you're going to have
[30:15] ai agents that are doing a lot of things
[30:18] around the globe
[30:20] um uh just in terms of institutional
[30:22] crypto investment this will unlock as we
[30:25] go through this real world uh assets so
[30:29] rw's tokenization is going to accelerate
[30:31] in my opinion on the back of stablecoin
[30:34] because you're GNA have the banks going
[30:35] in uh the banks are going to visit
[30:37] everyone with inside the crypto World
[30:40] particularly on the asset management
[30:41] side to understand the custody side in
[30:44] terms of the other place that stable
[30:45] coins are already being used by bigname
[30:47] places SpaceX is using them as a
[30:49] currency hedge so again if you're com a
[30:52] company like Google and you have uh you
[30:54] know offices overseas in China uh or in
[30:58] in uh any country where you're more
[30:59] worried about the currency any of the
[31:01] emerging markets and you do transactions
[31:03] over there you can just put your money
[31:05] into dollar-based stable coins and all
[31:07] of a sudden your currency's hedge and
[31:08] you don't have to go out and do FX
[31:10] transactions so just I think this is
[31:12] going to grow that's the way SpaceX is
[31:14] is is using it at this point and that's
[31:16] been out there and he's talked about it
[31:17] uh so why he's using them no currency
[31:20] risk and I think that's a big deal
[31:21] because they're cheaper they're better
[31:23] for companies uh every transaction that
[31:26] you do if you want to get your money
[31:27] back this this way you can get your
[31:28] money back in the States if you want it
[31:30] a much cheaper thing especially if you
[31:32] want to make investments and don't have
[31:33] to keep it inside the country so the
[31:35] cross currency side is there um and then
[31:37] finally I did do a substack this week on
[31:40] the inflation dilemma and the things
[31:41] I've talked about in here the
[31:42] combination of inflation going higher
[31:45] which is a a sticky thing at the same
[31:47] time and that's because of fiscal
[31:49] dominance and right now where we are
[31:50] with commodities and at the same time
[31:52] the squeeze that's coming from AI on
[31:54] small businesses uh I didn't show the
[31:56] small cap stocks but that has been a
[31:58] weaker thing all year and I think what
[31:59] you're getting is continued squeeze on
[32:01] things median voters everything I talk
[32:04] about the rise of Bitcoin in a broken
[32:05] system I talk about why I think last
[32:07] week was important so uh you can get it
[32:09] all there that's it for me uh this week
[32:11] the main message to take out is I think
[32:14] we're in a regime regime shift that's
[32:15] going to last for at least three months
[32:17] maybe longer uh doesn't mean the
[32:19] Market's going to go down if it did go
[32:21] down I'd be focused on uh the 100 day
[32:23] and 200 day moving averages for support
[32:24] but if we start to break down I'll give
[32:26] it in but I definitely think we're in a
[32:27] change for the market uh where
[32:29] overvalued names are going to have a
[32:32] much much higher hurdle to go higher on
[32:34] uh even if they produce earnings because
[32:36] I just don't think I think too much was
[32:38] built in and not enough was built into
[32:40] slowing growth in higher inflation
[32:41] that's it for this week
