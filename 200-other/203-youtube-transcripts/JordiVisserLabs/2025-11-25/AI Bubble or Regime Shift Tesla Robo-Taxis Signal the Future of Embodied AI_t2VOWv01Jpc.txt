--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Right, let's get right to it. Um,
[00:03] again, you guys can read through it, but
[00:04] it was a big week for stuff, at least in
[00:06] things of uh I'm looking at uh I think
[00:10] you'll uh you get a lot from this one.
[00:13] First of all, starts the week off.
[00:15] The next bubble in AI. So, we've got Sam
[00:18] Alman believes we're in an AI bubble.
[00:20] We've got Meta AI reality check.
[00:25] Howard Marx bubble.
[00:28] MIT failed to boost revenues.
[00:32] Palanteer tumbles after short selling
[00:37] and the AI winters upon us. All right,
[00:40] so I'll just keep saying this. This
[00:41] stuff is all stupid. Um, there's a truth
[00:45] involved in it in terms of the fact that
[00:47] there is speculation going on. There is
[00:50] a valuation issue, but I just want you
[00:54] guys to remember there's a difference
[00:55] between certain stocks being overvalued
[00:58] or building in way too much of the
[00:59] future, which I do believe is happening
[01:01] to some degree, um, and saying that AI
[01:05] is a bubble. This is the very early
[01:07] innings and as you get through this
[01:08] we're not even into the second stage
[01:11] which I think is the longest stage which
[01:12] I've highlighted before which is when
[01:15] the digital employees and the robotic
[01:17] employees start to come in and both of
[01:20] those will happen next year and so as
[01:22] you go through this that's the important
[01:24] point is
[01:26] use these AI bubble talks as
[01:28] opportunities for you guys to find
[01:30] things. I do believe this is a regime
[01:33] shift. You're going to hear this point
[01:34] again and again. and I've talked about
[01:35] it. I do believe we are at a very
[01:37] important macro regime shift. So for all
[01:39] the macro people out there, uh this
[01:41] thing is really more about the regime
[01:44] shift than it is about AI in general.
[01:47] All right, so let's continue.
[01:49] Uh here's the positive side. So Goldman
[01:52] comes back from a trip. I think the
[01:54] important thing to look at is that the
[01:57] acceleration in Gen AI adoption is
[01:59] starting in 2026. We haven't even seen
[02:02] the adoption yet. That's the main point.
[02:04] Um, all we've had is the infrastructure
[02:05] buildout. That is stage one. Stage two
[02:07] is the adoption side. This is when we
[02:09] start getting people actually using it.
[02:11] So those stories you saw, there's a
[02:13] truth in it. It has not been adopted
[02:14] yet. And the reason it hasn't been
[02:15] adopted yet is because people are lazy.
[02:17] Because people have trouble with the
[02:19] culture of the firms to get their people
[02:20] to use it. The easiest way to get people
[02:22] to use AI is to have AI use it as
[02:26] opposed to humans use it. The pressure
[02:29] on the Fed continued this week. Um, I
[02:32] won't go through all these stories.
[02:33] Let's just say whether it's uh mortgage
[02:36] fraud, whether it's he's late, whether I
[02:39] don't even care. Um it's non-stop. The
[02:42] pressure just continues. Zervos was on
[02:44] there saying the Fed's not independent
[02:46] and saying PAL is left-leaning. Uh and
[02:50] we get Pal flinching. So speaks of
[02:54] Jackson Hole. um you know you can go
[02:56] through and read whatever you want but
[02:58] the main thing is there's definitely a
[03:00] recognition that the labor market is
[03:02] weak and somewhere behind there whatever
[03:05] it is uh if the risks to employment are
[03:08] rising while inflation is believed to be
[03:12] temporary there's your justification for
[03:15] the rate cut in September which is only
[03:16] at 80 you know 80ish% coming out so it's
[03:20] not like it was a complete pivot um but
[03:23] basically this is paladopting the Chris
[03:25] Waller thesis, the leading candidate for
[03:27] the Fed chair. Uh
[03:31] I wrote a paper on this this week. Um
[03:33] regardless of what happens in September
[03:35] because we still have some more data for
[03:37] all the bears out there that want to
[03:40] believe that inflation is going higher
[03:42] and this and that, you are fading AI.
[03:45] And again, this whole paper, the
[03:46] academic Fed versus the inflation target
[03:48] of the future, a secular regime shift,
[03:50] however, is far more powerful. It
[03:52] usually reflects dramatic changes in
[03:54] monetary policy. That's what we're
[03:55] seeing, which is the the uh desire of
[03:58] this administration to run it hot. The
[04:01] reason they want to run it hot is partly
[04:04] because of the fiscal policy spend which
[04:07] is going towards AI. They've got all
[04:09] these artificial intelligence people
[04:10] behind there. So for everyone in X
[04:12] posting that they should be focusing on
[04:15] inflation, you are being academic.
[04:17] you're focusing on the today, the CPI
[04:20] today, the PPI today. The fact of the
[04:22] matter is we had five CPIs that came in
[04:25] uh below expectations. Then we had one
[04:27] that came in line and then we had a PPI
[04:29] that came above and everyone's freaking
[04:31] out because the tariff stuff is finally
[04:34] showing up. When you have a monetary
[04:35] policy shift, which we're seeing, which
[04:38] is they want to run it hot, you have a
[04:39] fiscal policy. They are not only
[04:41] spending money on the AI, they are
[04:43] focusing on so many different things on
[04:45] the fiscal side
[04:47] and not caring about the debt and
[04:49] deficit the way that people had thought
[04:51] uh not that long ago and you have a
[04:53] massive innovation shift. That's when
[04:55] you get regime shifts. I go through it
[04:56] in this I compare it to 2007 when we had
[05:00] the same type of situation. At that
[05:01] point it was the software boom. Besson
[05:04] argued that the US may be entering an
[05:05] environment reminiscent of under
[05:07] greenspan when rapid technological
[05:08] innovation allowed the Fed to run the
[05:10] economy very hot without sparking
[05:11] inflation as digital employees begin to
[05:14] replace human workers across industries
[05:16] that is beginning next year.
[05:18] Deflationary pressures from automation
[05:20] will be powerful and persistent. You
[05:22] have to be doing the Wayne Gretzky going
[05:25] to where the puck is to be an academic
[05:26] Fed and just be doing what you think
[05:28] based on today's data data dependent
[05:30] makes no sense in terms of a world where
[05:32] there's exponential change. The labor
[05:34] market is weak. I've highlighted it.
[05:36] There's no way you can look at this
[05:38] which is basically the service side, the
[05:39] office job then no job creation over the
[05:42] course of the last two and a half years.
[05:44] I've highlighted all these different
[05:45] stats. We have negative X healthcare.
[05:48] You have the diffusion index below 50,
[05:51] which historically is a recession. And
[05:53] you have if the labor participation rate
[05:55] had not fallen the last three months,
[05:57] the unemployment rate would be 4.9. We
[05:59] wouldn't even be having this discussion.
[06:01] We'd be going 50 if the labor
[06:03] participation rate hadn't gone down. And
[06:05] again, here's the last three months. And
[06:08] here is just the health care side. So
[06:12] negative ex healthcare extremely easy to
[06:15] see there. They should be cutting rates
[06:18] uh for people who don't believe it. Have
[06:20] fun. Uh the revisions massively lower
[06:23] and again the BLS is set to revise down
[06:26] US job numbers by 550 to 950,000. This
[06:28] is what started the SOM rule uh added to
[06:31] the SOM rule panic last year. This is
[06:32] coming according to Goldman on September
[06:34] 9th. If we're going to get another
[06:36] revision, that'd be the biggest 12-month
[06:39] downward revision in 15 years. Again,
[06:41] they have the reason to cut. And oh by
[06:45] the way, whether it was in the teback
[06:47] from the most recent quarter, if rates
[06:50] don't come down, you have a problem
[06:52] globally. Central banks are undergoing
[06:54] pressure to keep interest rates
[06:55] artificially to offset the cost of
[06:57] record borrowing. You're missing the
[06:59] debasement side. They have no choice in
[07:01] this element. They are not fighting
[07:02] inflation as much as they are fighting
[07:04] so many other problems that are acrewing
[07:06] every day. S&P gets back to new all-time
[07:08] highs after that little AI bubble fall.
[07:12] banks I mentioned globally they're going
[07:14] BKX right at the highs closed just a
[07:17] point below it uh a reflationary boom uh
[07:22] story uh sectors what you'll notice here
[07:26] energy best performing sector tech worst
[07:29] performing sector this is the rotation
[07:31] in the regime shift that I expect to
[07:33] happen as the time by the time you get
[07:35] through this entire presentation there
[07:37] are many many reasons for everyone
[07:39] saying that if they cut rates the big
[07:40] thing would be to short bonds.
[07:44] Yep. Continually the worst trade people
[07:48] can possibly do in an AI boom. So if
[07:51] your if your thought is they cut rates,
[07:52] they move 25, bonds are going to fall.
[07:54] They should have fallen on Friday. They
[07:56] didn't. Um I highlighted this last week.
[08:01] This is the or two weeks ago. This is
[08:03] the momentum in industrials. This just
[08:06] highlights this is the best performers
[08:07] in industrials. And then you can see the
[08:09] other half is horrible. These are
[08:12] related to the consumption economy, the
[08:14] auto economy, the real estate, whether
[08:16] it's residential or uh commercial. And
[08:20] then everything here is AI. If we are in
[08:22] a regime shift and rates are going to
[08:24] start to move lower,
[08:26] you should start to see these do better.
[08:30] And that's what we saw this week. This
[08:32] is the um industrial momentum. It's
[08:35] inverted. So we saw a sharp move the
[08:38] other direction after peaking. Uh this
[08:41] is overlaid with
[08:44] the PMI, the manufacturing PMI, which I
[08:47] will get into. Uh so again, another
[08:50] phrase that if you're going to have this
[08:51] move higher, that would mean that the
[08:53] things that are doing poorly start to do
[08:55] well as well the things that have been
[08:57] doing well. This is a tide that lifts
[08:59] all boats. The PMI is a diffusion index.
[09:01] You should start to see that go higher.
[09:04] We'll see what happens. momentum on the
[09:06] broader level. It was a a down week for
[09:09] momentum as well. Uh I just want to
[09:11] highlight these again. I've shown this
[09:12] chart multiple times. Regime shifts are
[09:15] critical. They happen for monetary
[09:17] policy for fiscal policy. This is the
[09:19] regime shift I I highlighted with
[09:20] software QE and austerity. Uh this was
[09:25] coming out of the great financial
[09:26] crisis. Then you had this one in in here
[09:29] related to uh the shift from oil when
[09:31] oil hits uh hit $25 and then we got the
[09:35] shift. Uh this one was going into COVID.
[09:38] This one was coming out. This was the
[09:40] shift in terms of the Fed pivot back in
[09:42] 22. This looked and to me was the
[09:45] beginning of the next shift. But then we
[09:47] had the tariffs which set us back
[09:48] higher. I still believe this is going to
[09:50] come. Momentum will shift. And if it
[09:53] does shift, you're talking about a
[09:55] regime shift that will have
[09:56] implications. It is always driven by the
[09:58] things that I mentioned. Uh in terms of
[10:00] the factors, size, I highlighted this
[10:02] last week. A 100% composite score,
[10:04] factor strength of 3.53. Here's momentum
[10:07] here. The two best factors. Uh I expect
[10:10] that size and momentum will be the ones
[10:12] that shift in a regime shift. And this
[10:14] week, the size factor, the pure size
[10:17] factor was down all five days this week.
[10:19] So regardless of whether it was the a
[10:21] the AI bubble or uh the fears over the
[10:26] Fed not cutting, then we got it built
[10:28] back in. So when you can have five days
[10:30] in a row of size under pressure, that
[10:31] says there's something going on. And
[10:33] this was the biggest weekly fall in size
[10:36] since right around the SAM rule back
[10:38] then when the rate cut started to be
[10:40] built in. So I do believe that size is
[10:43] going to be under pressure. small cap
[10:44] index. The S&P small cap index had its
[10:47] biggest day since the bottom in the
[10:49] stock market bacon based uh back in
[10:51] April and also the election back here
[10:53] which led to a rally. So when small caps
[10:56] have a big move like this, it's usually
[10:57] a turning point of some side and it
[10:59] comes at a time when they're finally
[11:01] having earnings. So small caps are
[11:04] beating by the widest margin since Q122.
[11:07] Uh we got all the press on how good the
[11:09] earnings season was, but the earnings
[11:10] season beats for a lot of these were not
[11:13] out of the ordinary. But for small caps,
[11:15] which should have been hurt the most by
[11:17] the tariffs, they still beat by I mean
[11:20] it's a huge be.
[11:22] Uh the positioning in Russell futures
[11:26] net short by the biggest amount, even
[11:29] lower than the amount in 2022 when rate
[11:32] hikes were going on. positions there.
[11:34] And John Rog, if you guys uh you can see
[11:37] John Rog's email here, I highly
[11:38] recommend reaching out to him. John and
[11:40] I have known each other a long time.
[11:42] I've shown him uh his work on here a
[11:44] couple times, but right now because of
[11:46] the regime shift side, he happens to be
[11:48] on the same side out of a lot of things.
[11:50] And John and I do not do anything
[11:52] together. I don't I use charts on my
[11:54] own. I'm an Elliot wave person. But what
[11:56] John is great at is these big bases,
[11:58] which usually when there's a turn happen
[12:01] at regime shifts. So, in terms of where
[12:04] the Russell 2000 is, he's bullish on it
[12:07] and he sees a potential big base. So, a
[12:09] breakout above here would have to happen
[12:11] in my opinion for a secular side. He's
[12:13] positive on it. I like it at that point.
[12:15] And it matches up because that big base
[12:18] coincides with the PMI sitting below 50.
[12:21] And again, for those of you who don't
[12:24] understand the PMI below 50, think of it
[12:27] as uh it's a survey. It has five
[12:30] components that make up the the actual
[12:32] number. And if we're below 50, think of
[12:36] it as there's not more than 50% of the
[12:39] economy doing well. That typically
[12:41] happens during recession. It's a
[12:43] diffusion index. It's very similar to
[12:45] the industries on the job side that I
[12:48] showed. We've been in this for a long
[12:50] time. And I actually believe that the
[12:52] entire time in here, there was no
[12:54] cyclical upswing uh that was durable.
[12:58] These were all the reversals of negative
[13:00] situations. This one's going to be
[13:02] different to me. I think it's going to
[13:03] last and it's going to look more like
[13:05] this period in here when we stayed above
[13:07] 50 for a long time. In this case, we
[13:09] stayed below here for a long time.
[13:11] Somewhat similar to what went on in
[13:13] here. So, just keep that in mind as we
[13:15] go through because as I've talked about,
[13:18] um,
[13:20] PMIs, the S&P Global released their
[13:23] flash numbers, best in more than three
[13:25] years in the US. Uh companies across
[13:28] manufacturing services are reporting
[13:30] stronger demand conditions but are
[13:32] struggling to meet sales growth causing
[13:34] backlogs of work to rise at a pace not
[13:36] seen since the p pandemic related
[13:38] capacity constraints recorded in 22. So
[13:41] last time we saw a supply demand
[13:43] situation like this was during during
[13:46] the the point where people weren't
[13:49] working around the globe. Uh, a lot of
[13:52] this is going to have to do with
[13:53] tariffs, but the bulk of this is going
[13:55] to have to happen because of AI.
[13:59] Combined with the upturn in business
[14:01] activity and hiring, the rise in prices
[14:03] signaled by the survey puts the PMI data
[14:05] more into rate hiking rather than
[14:08] cutting territory according to the
[14:09] historical relationship. I bring that up
[14:11] because again, they want to run it hot.
[14:14] You're going to have a time where PMIs
[14:16] are rising above 50 and the Fed is
[14:18] cutting rates.
[14:20] not going to happen too often and I
[14:22] think people need to pay attention and
[14:23] start to change their positioning based
[14:25] on that. Focus on small caps, focus on
[14:27] some of the lagards and some of the
[14:29] things that are rate sensitive because I
[14:30] think the Fed has or the administration
[14:32] has more surprises to help in the
[14:35] housing market and that would just be
[14:37] the final tailwind. So for people that
[14:39] have been bearish on PMIs have pushed
[14:41] back on me continuously on this, it's
[14:43] not just in the US. The Euro zone
[14:45] composite PMI rose 51, strongest private
[14:48] expansion since May of 24, highest in 38
[14:51] months for the manufacturing component.
[14:54] Japan quickest pace in six months. India
[14:58] fastest activity in at least two
[15:00] decades. Prices rise. Australia good
[15:04] proxy for China solid 54.9.
[15:09] Morgan Stanley revised up their global
[15:11] capbook significantly. You're talking
[15:13] now well over a trillion dollars over
[15:15] the course of the next two years. Uh the
[15:17] data center power demand double now.
[15:20] They've moved everything up. This number
[15:22] here used to be about 95 or 92 according
[15:26] to Eric Schmidt. We're now up 15 20%. Uh
[15:30] meeting 100 gawatts which is less than
[15:32] that number would require a thousand
[15:34] natural gas turbines.
[15:36] Not going to go through this. You guys
[15:37] understand um everyone who's been
[15:39] bearish on China and I mean God when
[15:42] they came out with this stimulus here
[15:44] everyone was bearish on it consolidated
[15:46] in a beautiful chart formation. This is
[15:48] called a third wave folks. This is a
[15:50] parabolic move breaking out of a 10-year
[15:53] base. I'm not going to show the John Rog
[15:55] side but he's got a 10-year base on this
[15:57] too. This is not something to fade. And
[16:00] yet most people are still negative on
[16:02] China. China stock index rises to decade
[16:04] high as they're dumping bonds. Turnover
[16:07] on the mainland exchanges reached second
[16:08] highest level ever. So what's happening
[16:10] on big volume? 30-year bond. When the
[16:13] stock market was rising, I kept hearing
[16:15] that bond yields are not rising. This is
[16:17] something the fade activity is not
[16:18] happening. Wrong, wrong, wrong. China's
[16:21] stock rally has the makings of a durable
[16:24] bull run.
[16:26] Uh FOMO is setting in now. Finally,
[16:31] the scariest aspect of the ongoing share
[16:33] rally is that it has unfolded
[16:35] organically despite widespread
[16:37] skepticism in the wellrecoognized lack
[16:39] of meaningful policy support. So,
[16:41] everyone thought they needed more
[16:42] policy. And I've highlighted before that
[16:44] IP is well above the old traditional
[16:46] signals. This is a new world of AI. This
[16:50] is a new world of drones, of humanoids.
[16:53] It has nothing to do with what you've
[16:54] learned in the past. There will never be
[16:56] another property boom in China. Go read
[16:59] a new book. That being said, all the
[17:02] stuff out there in stimulus that's come
[17:04] out, this is all this week, loans,
[17:07] focus on property market, focus on
[17:09] property market, focus on property
[17:11] market, they are trying to get the
[17:13] stabilize the prop property market. It's
[17:16] never going to rise. And if you keep
[17:17] looking at it in a big way like what's
[17:18] coming, by the time that comes, they'll
[17:20] have runaway inflation. They'll have all
[17:22] kinds of problems. They don't want that.
[17:24] This is a new era. All right? And the
[17:26] new era we're talking about the regime
[17:28] shift. I wrote this in April from cloud
[17:30] so software to embodied AI. This is what
[17:33] we are now entering. This is the part
[17:35] that you guys this is a long uh paper I
[17:38] wrote back in there uh for 22V. We stand
[17:42] at the brink of a new era. One that may
[17:43] prove even more transformative. The rise
[17:45] in AI marks a turning point not only for
[17:47] how software is built and deployed but
[17:49] how it how in machines interact with the
[17:52] physical world. As Alain must put it, AI
[17:54] is the most profound technology humanity
[17:55] will ever develop. Bubble more profound
[17:58] than electricity or fire. If software
[18:00] ate the world, AI is poised to rebuild
[18:02] it. Rebuild the entire world because of
[18:05] sticking intelligence into machines.
[18:08] This has to be understood as I go
[18:10] through the rest of this because we are
[18:11] at that critical point. The convergence
[18:13] of AI and hardware advancements is
[18:15] unfolding against the backdrop of a
[18:17] profound macro regime shift driven by
[18:19] simultaneous changes in fiscal,
[18:21] monetary, and innovative forces. Again,
[18:23] I wrote this in April. We are now in the
[18:26] stage where every single one of them is
[18:28] in play. And here's what you need to
[18:30] start to focus on. Uh I've owned a Tesla
[18:32] or multiple Teslas since 2012. So I love
[18:35] the car. Could care less about the stock
[18:38] historically. This is the first time
[18:39] I've ever talked about it in any
[18:41] meaningful way. the robo taxis you have
[18:43] to understand I I'm this paper is not
[18:46] out uh I'm just showing you that I'm
[18:49] doing a long form paper specifically on
[18:51] robo taxis to highlight the importance
[18:53] the opening act of embodied AI if you
[18:55] guys haven't reached out to 22V yet and
[18:57] you're interested in Tesla reach out now
[19:01] this mustwatch this is from Adam Jonas
[19:04] who is probably my favorite stock
[19:06] analyst ever in the history of my
[19:09] involvement in the markets uh and auto
[19:11] analyst who took the same path I did
[19:14] about the same time to really understand
[19:16] how much technology was changing the old
[19:19] industrial world and how the economy was
[19:21] no longer representative of what it used
[19:23] to be and it was around the same time.
[19:25] So Adam put out this video. It's about
[19:28] 22 minutes. I highly recommend it. The
[19:30] robots are coming. You'll learn a lot.
[19:31] AI is about to get physical is where
[19:33] you'll find it in YouTube. The
[19:35] highlights are unbelievable. Embodied AI
[19:37] is a decat trillion TAM. So when people
[19:39] are fading AI and they're saying they're
[19:41] never going to get the revenues, they
[19:43] may not get on the software side, but
[19:45] his focus is how we're going to get it
[19:47] on the physical side. This is important
[19:48] for PMIs. This is important for macro
[19:51] people. This is important for everyone
[19:52] who needs to understand how the economy
[19:54] is going to change. You will have
[19:56] humanoids walking around you on the
[19:58] street in four years. You'll have flying
[20:00] cars. How can you not be paying
[20:02] attention to this? Go watch this for 22
[20:04] minutes and at least get an
[20:05] understanding. There's a generational
[20:07] TAM expansion beyond software into
[20:09] robotics, logistics, mobility, and
[20:10] defense.
[20:12] The race for photons. This is critical
[20:14] in understanding the robo taxis. That's
[20:16] why I have this little blue line here.
[20:17] Companies with the best vision actuation
[20:20] data sets will dominate embodied AI. We
[20:22] are leaving software and we get it.
[20:24] We're getting into the point. This is
[20:26] about vision. It's about photons. This
[20:28] is what Adam does a great job of
[20:30] highlighting which I haven't seen in
[20:31] anything else. This is the next
[20:33] hyperscaler, capex, track robotics,
[20:35] supply chains, sensors, actuators,
[20:37] batteries, semis. This is all
[20:38] manufacturing. Tesla's advantage and
[20:41] their moat is manufacturing is the key.
[20:44] You have to think about that when you
[20:45] realize all the AI action plan and
[20:47] everything we're doing.
[20:49] Um, it's not an auto company. It's the
[20:51] first vertically integrated embodied AI
[20:53] company positioned for humanoids and
[20:54] autonomy. Multi- trillion upside. This
[20:57] is why you have to go pay attention to
[20:59] it. Robo taxi equals one of the biggest
[21:02] monetization opportunities in history.
[21:03] Think ad models, entertainment,
[21:05] productivity unlocks. This is what Adam
[21:07] Jonas highlights. These are all the
[21:09] things from the video. This is why
[21:10] watching it is important. China makes
[21:12] more drones in one day than the US does
[21:14] in one year. Hence the need for us to
[21:15] build up our manufacturing because it's
[21:17] a national security in for defense
[21:20] budgets. No way it's going to stop.
[21:22] Humanoids are for and $40 trillion labor
[21:25] market. This is the impact. This is why
[21:26] profit margins will sore as we get
[21:28] through digital employees and robotics.
[21:31] Um, manufacturing decline reversal.
[21:34] Manufacturing dropped from 30% to 10%
[21:37] over 80 years. Macro regime shift. He's
[21:40] calling for the exact same thing.
[21:41] Embodied AI position to reverse this
[21:43] trend. This is industrial policy plus
[21:46] productivity super cycle opportunities
[21:48] and semis. Robotics component supply all
[21:50] of this stuff. You can go read it all.
[21:52] This is not something that won't happen.
[21:54] It is here. and robo taxis are the first
[21:57] place where it's going to show up.
[21:59] Jensen Yuan talked about it and he said
[22:01] there was a chat GPT moment for robotics
[22:03] coming soon. That would be this moment
[22:06] in my opinion with um robotics. If you
[22:08] want to go listen to a podcast, this is
[22:11] uh from Gavin Baker. This is on invest
[22:13] like the best. This is a year ago where
[22:15] he was talking about the early stages of
[22:18] LLMs, Nvidia, reasons that they would
[22:21] have a little bit of trouble. Gavin
[22:22] Bacon is one of the the be Gavin Baker
[22:24] is one of the best out there in my
[22:26] opinion on what has been happening. He's
[22:28] been studying this for a while. It's
[22:29] very hard to find people who understand
[22:30] Tesla from both a technology perspective
[22:34] but also from the uh the embodied AI
[22:37] perspective. An auto analyst is not
[22:39] going to get that for you unless it's
[22:41] Adam Jonas. Here's one of the quotes
[22:43] from there and the thing you have to
[22:44] understand. So so you have to remember
[22:46] for Tesla Tesla is going to the same
[22:47] miles between disengagements. It's like
[22:49] if you ever built a new cities on Mars
[22:51] and it was populated by entirely
[22:53] different looking cars and streets and
[22:55] everything, you could drop a Tesla robo
[22:57] taxi in that city and it would have the
[22:59] same miles between disengagements in any
[23:01] other city. Where something like Whimo,
[23:03] which you may have been in, Whimo has
[23:05] more cars than Tesla, but their
[23:07] technology and approach is completely
[23:10] different. It's geoenced, which means
[23:12] it's using maps and sensors as opposed
[23:15] to what Tesla robo taxi is, which is
[23:17] sticking a brain in the car to learn as
[23:20] it goes. Tesla has launched its robo
[23:23] taxi. Now, what that was an arc research
[23:26] thing. You can go read it from this
[23:27] week.
[23:29] Tesla secures Texas permit for driver.
[23:32] Now, what I'm getting into is what it's
[23:34] important for investors and how quickly
[23:36] this can scale. He is seating cities
[23:39] cities across the country with little
[23:42] amounts of cars 10 to 20. That's why
[23:44] people will fade it once it starts to
[23:46] work. You will be able to extrapolate
[23:49] very quickly. So we are at a point now
[23:51] where all the signs are showing up that
[23:53] he's ready for this now. So he gets the
[23:56] permit in Texas.
[23:58] The Tesla robo taxi service area is
[24:00] already larger than any competitors in
[24:02] Austin and Bay Area. Again, different
[24:04] technology, different approach. an
[24:06] analyst went in it this week and there's
[24:08] been plenty of them that have gone
[24:09] through it because remember this was
[24:10] only released in June. So this is now
[24:13] you're looking for signs as to when this
[24:15] will start to take off. Uh we
[24:17] experienced a glimpse of the future and
[24:18] exciting the comparisons are meeting in
[24:20] Stark. I won't read the whole thing. You
[24:22] guys can go read it. It was on TV.
[24:24] William Blair analyst is impressed by
[24:26] the rides felt a lot more like person
[24:28] was driving it while rides still feel
[24:31] somewhat robotic. different
[24:32] technologies. Version 14 of Tesla
[24:36] self-driving feels sentient. Version 14
[24:39] is not out yet. He's saying it's coming
[24:42] out soon. So that's another level. He's
[24:45] been testing this. Italy, Netherlands,
[24:48] Japan, Spain, UK, Germany. You can
[24:51] extrapolate again and get how big this
[24:53] can be. If you heard about this signing,
[24:56] a 16.5 billion dollar deal with Samsung
[24:59] this month, he posted, "The strategic
[25:02] importance of this is hard to overstate.
[25:06] This is the company's bet on an all-in
[25:08] one chip design that can scale from
[25:10] powering its driver assistance system
[25:11] known as FSD to Tesla's Optimus hum."
[25:15] This deal is because he expects this to
[25:18] accelerate, which should not be a
[25:20] surprise, but here's going uh he's been
[25:22] posting all week. This was from this
[25:24] week. This is him saying that last year.
[25:28] This will change the look of the roads.
[25:31] Robo trucking is also part of this. You
[25:33] should go watch this video from person
[25:35] who does next big future to go see that
[25:38] trucks, semi-truckss will be on here.
[25:39] Just think about what this does in terms
[25:41] of cost deflation coming both from not
[25:44] needing people and being able to drive
[25:46] down prices, but from competition.
[25:49] And Musk put out his warning. If they
[25:51] don't exit their short position before
[25:52] Tesla reaches autonomy at scale, they
[25:54] will be obliterated. There's no doubt
[25:56] about that. Uh John Rog, here's his
[25:59] second one. Again, big base. What's
[26:02] happened on the Tesla big base? This is
[26:04] what really started the timing of this.
[26:06] I use a fundamental side, which I
[26:08] already had all of the things. I had
[26:09] already heard the Gavin Bacon interview,
[26:12] all of this stuff. And then John says
[26:14] out of nowhere, I really think Tesla's
[26:16] going to start to break out. Okay. I
[26:18] believe charts give you an insight into
[26:21] matching up. And then when you go do the
[26:22] work, you put it in the bigger picture.
[26:24] When you put in rate cuts, when you put
[26:26] in a a a regime shift and you put all
[26:29] these things and you start searching and
[26:31] Tesla has underperformed, it's down 20%.
[26:33] Elon Musk is hated by Republicans. He's
[26:35] hated by Democrats at this point. He's
[26:37] hated around the globe. And yet somehow
[26:39] the chart looks good.
[26:42] another technician who I I have on my ex
[26:45] post who does different work than John,
[26:48] more short-term oriented, more trading
[26:50] oriented.
[26:51] This is the start of a coming technical
[26:54] breakout in my view. Today's move to six
[26:56] day highs exceeded the minor downtrend,
[26:57] blah blah blah. You get the point. I've
[26:59] got technicians all bringing up the same
[27:01] thing. At the same time, if you guys
[27:03] aren't familiar that humanoids are
[27:05] sitting here, then you should go watch
[27:06] the world humanoid robot highlights.
[27:09] Yes, the Olympia the Olympiad of robots
[27:12] was in Beijing. They wanted to show off
[27:16] how this is going. And of course, you
[27:18] know, the Chinese won the top medal in
[27:20] most of the world's humanoid robot
[27:21] games. But you can go see that this
[27:23] happened and we're at this point now.
[27:26] Okay. So, I'm positive on AI. That being
[27:29] said, uh this is something I think
[27:32] people should read and this gets into
[27:34] some of the issues and the major issues
[27:35] I have with the Mag 7. So again, I'm
[27:38] talking about a major regime shift away
[27:40] from the software dominated world that
[27:42] has been in place for 18 years and into
[27:44] a new world completely dominated by the
[27:46] hardware side. If you are long software
[27:49] companies, as I highlighted last week,
[27:51] you are exposed to coding being free and
[27:55] being able to replicate everything on
[27:57] your hand. So this is from uh Harris
[28:02] Cuppupperman. He goes by Cuppy on X. Uh
[28:05] I saw this uh and I read it and I
[28:07] actually liked it and I think you guys
[28:09] should read it too. Um sometimes a
[28:12] hyperrowth company amazed me when it
[28:13] actually grows into its valuation.
[28:15] That's though that's rarer than you
[28:17] think. Usually cash flow is king. ROIC
[28:20] is the queen and everything else is
[28:21] simply stock promotion. Hence hence the
[28:23] skeptism I heard towards anything new.
[28:25] Okay, I want to bring this up because
[28:28] normally I would say okay this is just a
[28:29] perma bear. He uses AI a lot and gets
[28:32] huge value from it. I'm not here to
[28:34] belittle AI. It's the future and I
[28:36] recognize we're just scratching the
[28:37] surface in terms of what it can do.
[28:39] Okay, this brings back credibility
[28:41] immediately and I want to read the rest
[28:43] of the report. I recognize all this. I
[28:45] also recognize massive capital
[28:47] misallocation when I see it. I recognize
[28:49] an insanity bubble and I recognize
[28:51] hubris. This is the bubble that I agree
[28:54] with. Massive capital misallocation.
[28:57] It's not that they're misallocating.
[28:58] They're chasing something which I don't
[29:00] think they're going to get the benefits
[29:01] from. I recognize an insanity bubble.
[29:03] Okay. Whether it's the spending or
[29:05] whether it's people that are are buying
[29:07] these types of names at regardless of
[29:10] the valuation. And I get hubris. I think
[29:13] we're I think those are all fair
[29:15] comments. Now,
[29:17] this is one of the things that got
[29:18] people all freaked out. A hiring freeze
[29:20] at Meta AI operations in effect after
[29:22] investors voiced concerns about the
[29:24] scale of Meta stockbased compensation
[29:26] costs. So, it sounds like investors,
[29:29] board members, whatever. basically
[29:33] forced Meta to come out with a statement
[29:35] saying they're not going to be hiring
[29:36] people for $100 million anymore. So,
[29:38] they made their big bet. Okay, it's not
[29:40] a bearish thing for Meta overall, but it
[29:43] does show that the capex side, the
[29:45] spending side is becoming an issue and
[29:47] if they don't start seeing the returns,
[29:49] you're going to have problems with these
[29:50] stocks. So, the rest of what I want to
[29:52] show here, so Jim Chainos came out with
[29:54] this. I kind of highlighted it. this is
[29:56] getting into on its capital base.
[30:00] The depreciation of this um the
[30:03] accounting that's going on on this is
[30:05] just going to put more pressure. This is
[30:06] the critical detail that nobody can
[30:08] unravel in the AI trade. Free cash flow
[30:11] has turned negative for Amazon and
[30:12] Oracle and declined for Alphabet Meta
[30:14] amid heavy AI spending. Again, they're
[30:17] spending money to get something in
[30:18] return. This worked with the cloud. The
[30:20] question is, is it going to work now? I
[30:22] think this is a much bigger problem for
[30:25] them. Uh a because of how much money
[30:27] they're spending and secondly because of
[30:30] this thing that software is going to
[30:31] already be eating away at some of their
[30:32] businesses and I don't know how they're
[30:34] going to get this. So it seems like it's
[30:35] all related to AGI which is some
[30:37] mythical thing that we're not sure how
[30:39] you can monetize. The Mag 7 tech giants
[30:41] outspend rest of corporate America 2 to1
[30:44] on capex. Again this is a massive bet
[30:47] that becomes very important for the
[30:49] market. uh mag seven value to free cash
[30:53] flow. Now again, it worked in here. The
[30:56] question is, will it work expanding
[30:58] this? Now, I'm gonna say no. And here's
[31:01] the problem. There's no more room for
[31:03] for error. The Magnificent 7s EUR has
[31:06] outpested the rest of the S&P by more
[31:08] than 20 points for five consecutive
[31:10] quarters.
[31:12] So, here's the problem. It's
[31:13] outperformed in terms of earnings
[31:16] significantly,
[31:17] but it's underperformed the market. So,
[31:20] you have a divergence. I'd be worried if
[31:22] I were people overweight these things.
[31:25] John Rogue back again
[31:28] highlighting this little point here.
[31:30] Here's here's the Mag 7. Uh
[31:34] again, on a relative basis, it's down
[31:36] for the year. So, it hasn't worked. I
[31:39] believe this is a problem you need to
[31:41] start paying attention to. And the
[31:42] reason is here's another Alan Mus pose
[31:45] from this week. It's an easy prediction
[31:48] of where things are headed. No more
[31:50] traditional operating system or apps,
[31:53] but just AI rendering everything
[31:54] directly. This is another critical thing
[31:57] for people to spend time on on learning.
[31:59] You can go into chat GPT take that that
[32:03] exact quote and then bring it in. But
[32:04] here's the details. They envision a
[32:06] future where smartphones function as
[32:08] AIdriven engine instead of routing every
[32:10] task through a cloud service. The phone
[32:13] itself would act as an intelligent
[32:15] rendering engine. So I just want you to
[32:17] think about this. If you've been
[32:18] wondering why we haven't had AI on a
[32:20] phone yet, but we have it on our
[32:22] computer. This is really getting into
[32:24] it. So I'm using AI on my phone. I'm
[32:26] using chat GPT and I'm talking to it.
[32:30] But that's not actually using it to to
[32:32] do what I want it to do. Hey, go order
[32:33] me an Uber. Hey, go do this. Hey, go do
[32:36] that. It doesn't work well. And the
[32:39] reason is the bandwidth constraints make
[32:41] pure cloud AI impractical. So what he's
[32:44] talking about if realized the architect
[32:47] the architecture of having a phone that
[32:49] has AI on it. If you want an app, you
[32:52] just build it yourself. That's what Alon
[32:54] Mus is talking about. And without going
[32:56] through all the details, Mus AI is
[32:58] betting that the future of software
[33:00] isn't apps at all. It's AI native
[33:02] devices powered by a blend of massive
[33:04] centralized training and decentralized
[33:06] edge inference. This is very similar to
[33:08] what he is doing in terms of the car
[33:11] versus Whimo. AI AI just becomes part of
[33:14] the machine rather than having to use
[33:16] the apps on the machine. When you use an
[33:19] AI system like chat GBT or GR today,
[33:21] most of the heavy lifting happens in
[33:22] giant data centers and your device just
[33:25] streams the results back. So you're
[33:26] doing the work off the machine. That's
[33:29] fine for text, but when AI start
[33:30] generating full experiences in real
[33:32] time, the amount of data that's needed
[33:34] to flow between your phone and the cloud
[33:36] becomes enormous. Now, before I read
[33:38] this, just remember massive regime shift
[33:41] from software to hardware emphasized
[33:43] again here. The economics and physics of
[33:45] networks can't keep up with billions of
[33:48] people trying to stream full AI
[33:50] generated environments simultaneously.
[33:52] Again, you're going to need batteries.
[33:54] You're going to need semiconductors.
[33:56] Instead of doing it on the cloud and in
[33:58] the data centers, it's going to have to
[33:59] happen in each device, whether it's a
[34:01] humanoid, whether it's a car, whether
[34:02] it's a computer, whether it's a phone.
[34:05] The buildout of the hardware is massive.
[34:07] Do not fade it.
[34:10] The next phase of AI. So, I went through
[34:11] so this is about hardware moving
[34:13] forward. Next phase of AI isn't just
[34:15] about clever. It's about hardware and
[34:16] infrastructure.
[34:18] The training was in the cloud. That's
[34:21] phase one. But inference running the AI
[34:23] to generate answers, visuals or actions
[34:25] needs to happen locally on the devices,
[34:26] phones, cars, robots because of the
[34:28] bandwidth in them. If AI agents replace
[34:31] apps, then the real mode isn't the app
[34:32] store anymore. It's who controls the
[34:34] hardware layer and who can manufacture
[34:35] them at scale. Moving forward, the
[34:37] bottleneck and battleground is hardware,
[34:39] compute capacity, chip design, and
[34:41] adapt people. And again, this means I'm
[34:45] negative on the Mag 7. Not for them to
[34:47] go down, but for them to have trouble
[34:49] going up and to underperform. They will
[34:52] still be having earnings, but they are
[34:55] valued at a level that has built it that
[34:57] has not built in the risk of them not
[34:59] getting enough return rather than the
[35:00] capex. Think of them as bleeding rather
[35:03] than gushing. Now, this leads us finally
[35:07] to Bitcoin, which is still the chart is
[35:09] fantastic. Again, it's consolidating up
[35:11] here. came to the bottom end of the
[35:12] range and then when Palism Smoke it got
[35:14] back up to 116 which is where it is this
[35:16] morning on Saturday. Um Ethereum made
[35:18] new all-time highs. Another big base.
[35:21] John Rog likes these as well. I'm just
[35:23] not including the chart. My favorite
[35:25] chart. If the Mag 7 are going to
[35:26] underperform, guess what? Bitcoin is the
[35:30] large cap that will start to win. I
[35:32] believe this happens into the end of the
[35:33] year and you start to see Bitcoin as I
[35:37] said it would be the second largest uh
[35:39] asset in the world. It's going to be
[35:40] hard to do. I'll stick with it because I
[35:42] did think we were going to get there.
[35:44] But regardless, this is it relative to
[35:45] the Mag 7. This is the trade that I
[35:47] think is the most important. And just
[35:49] two pieces of news. The Fed talked a lot
[35:51] about payments. Uh cryp changes coming
[35:54] to how the Fed views AI and crypto. Very
[35:57] important especially since again we have
[35:58] a regime shift. So the Fed's going to be
[36:00] more involved in this. And finally, uh
[36:03] Brian Armstrong said we'll see a million
[36:04] Bitcoin by 2030. Uh one more week of me
[36:08] in Maine. Hope you guys have had a great
[36:10] summer as we head into the final week.
[36:13] Uh, lot of stuff on here that I think is
[36:15] important. Reach out if you have
[36:16] anything and remember 22V research. I'll
[36:18] be doing the Tesla report there. Have a
[36:21] great final week of the
