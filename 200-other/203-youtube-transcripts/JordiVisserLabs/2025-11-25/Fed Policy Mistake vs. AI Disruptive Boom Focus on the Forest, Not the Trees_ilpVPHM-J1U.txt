--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] All right, busy week, lot to go through.
[00:03] Um,
[00:06] all AI again. You guys can read on your
[00:08] own. Uh, first of all, first time since
[00:12] November 2021 that all four major
[00:15] benchmarks closed together at fresh
[00:17] highs. Rare feat only occurring 25 other
[00:20] days this century. So, equity markets
[00:23] are screaming. We love Fed cuts. NDX,
[00:28] Russell, S&PX,
[00:32] and the Dow all up for the week uh with
[00:36] the Russell 2000 uh slightly below the
[00:40] NDX for the weekly move. And again, for
[00:43] everyone focused on policy mistakes, and
[00:46] that was the that was the word of the
[00:48] week this week, stagflation last week.
[00:51] um for all the ex people posting and
[00:54] everything about policy mistake uh and
[00:57] tenure rates rates are down since Powell
[01:01] did his Jackson hole despite the fact
[01:03] that most of the data has suggested
[01:06] things are stronger uh bonval the white
[01:09] line here really falling sharply and
[01:13] getting back down here again if there
[01:15] was a policy mistake and fears over the
[01:17] what the Fed was doing we wouldn't be
[01:19] seeing bond volatility ility breakdown.
[01:22] Uh at the same time, we've got the
[01:24] tripleB spreads down near the all-time
[01:26] lows and junk. This is a monthly chart
[01:30] going back to 1990. We are easily at the
[01:33] tightest levels ever. So, not only is
[01:35] the economy good, the Fed is cutting
[01:38] rates. So, the playbook should be
[01:40] simple. Be bullish. Jump into things. Uh
[01:45] momentum has soared higher. I think it
[01:47] was right around here that I highlighted
[01:49] again for about the fourth time that we
[01:51] had MACD sell signals. I think I've done
[01:54] this about six times over the course of
[01:56] this year looking for some change in
[01:58] momentum on the back of PMIs going
[02:00] higher and momentum just continues to
[02:02] power uh dominated again by the AI AI
[02:05] theme and even though the Russell had a
[02:07] good week and outperformed the S&P
[02:10] the pure size factor which strips out
[02:13] the sector biases uh continued higher as
[02:16] well. So the factors on the pure basis
[02:20] continue to move and I think one of the
[02:22] dominant reasons is this. Um retail had
[02:24] a party last week. So funds and
[02:26] institutions yelling for policy mistake
[02:29] and sell the news and everything I had
[02:31] heard leading into the Fed. Uh here is
[02:35] retail's favorite index. This is the
[02:37] Goldman Sachs retail favorite index.
[02:39] This is the meme index. This is the most
[02:42] shorted for um for hedge funds index and
[02:46] this is the nonprofitable tech. So
[02:49] again, you can sit there and say this is
[02:51] retail is going crazy, but retail's just
[02:54] following the playbook, which is they're
[02:56] cutting rates near all-time highs. So
[02:58] pal and them, they they cut rates and
[03:00] they've shifted to focusing on the job
[03:02] market, which I completely agree with.
[03:04] And there's a variety of reasons. But
[03:06] again, we've got people saying policy
[03:08] mistake. And again, just like I did with
[03:10] stagflation, this word means nothing. It
[03:12] gets thrown around. Policy mistake. I I
[03:15] just don't even know what it means other
[03:17] than I'm right, you're wrong. This is a
[03:20] mistake. That's not the way you make
[03:22] money in markets. Um, just something for
[03:24] the future that's been brought out this
[03:26] week in his congressional testimony. Uh,
[03:31] he did mention the third mandate for the
[03:34] Fed. uh which again
[03:38] we're starting to get back into this
[03:40] thing which I think people should again
[03:42] be focused on and this gets into this
[03:45] concept that the Fed share will be
[03:47] pushed out and the new Fed chair will
[03:49] come in and Trump wants long-term rates
[03:52] down. You can argue with what whether
[03:55] it's a mistake to do that, but that's
[03:57] what they want. Um, and just to show how
[04:00] long this question has been on the third
[04:02] part of their congressional mandate,
[04:05] uh, Pal said, "We haven't thought about
[04:07] that for a very long time." But Long
[04:09] View, one of the better macro, um,
[04:13] posts out there, is highlighted three
[04:17] times over the course of the last seven
[04:20] years about this third mandate. So, I
[04:22] think it's just something to keep in the
[04:23] back of your mind uh, as we go through
[04:25] this. Now, it's not just one rate cut.
[04:27] Right now, we have a 92% chance of an
[04:29] October rate cut. We have an 88% chance
[04:31] of December. So, again, don't get caught
[04:35] up in this quote unquote policy mistake.
[04:37] And most of the policy policy mistakes
[04:39] again that I hear are inflation. And I'm
[04:41] just going to continue to say here's
[04:43] inflation year-over-year 2.9% basically
[04:46] within the range of where it is. We have
[04:48] rates higher. I've shown this before.
[04:50] Rates should be coming down. Policy
[04:52] mistake is a bet and belief that
[04:54] inflation is going to go higher. If it
[04:56] wasn't for this
[04:58] during this period in here, people
[05:00] really didn't focus on inflation even
[05:02] when we had these little up moves in
[05:03] this point. Now next year I do believe
[05:07] we will see close to 4% but only because
[05:10] I believe oil will surprise and go
[05:12] higher in the back and PMIs and that gas
[05:15] on the pump will go higher. The this is
[05:19] just showing that it's really hard to
[05:20] get headline inflation to come over. If
[05:22] we had gas at the pump up 20 to 30%
[05:25] year-over-year,
[05:26] putting it up basically at $4 a gallon
[05:29] as opposed to 320, then you'd see this
[05:31] up near four, if not slightly higher,
[05:33] and I don't think the Fed would be
[05:35] cutting. So, I think that's an important
[05:37] part to look at. The reason the cuts
[05:39] make sense is because, and I'm going to
[05:41] write about this this week, we are at a
[05:43] very, very K-shaped economy, and the
[05:47] Fed's job, if inflation is not soaring
[05:50] higher, is to deal with this situation,
[05:52] which is we're in recessionary territory
[05:54] for job creation. Everyone can go
[05:57] through their explanations and
[05:58] immigration and all of this stuff. It
[06:00] doesn't really matter to me one bit. We
[06:02] have a problem here where there's no job
[06:04] hiring going on. It shows up in all the
[06:07] statistics about hiring. Again, AI is
[06:11] coming. It is only going to worsen in
[06:14] the coming years in terms of the
[06:15] pressure on the labor market and also
[06:17] the deflationary pressures that will be
[06:19] coming from AI 3 years from now. They
[06:22] should be cutting rates and the
[06:23] administration which is AI focused and
[06:26] has every AI leader in the world in the
[06:28] White House on a consistent basis
[06:31] including David Sachs sitting there as
[06:33] the AI AISAR.
[06:35] They know what's coming. You guys know
[06:38] what's coming, but we're still focusing
[06:40] too much on what has happened over the
[06:42] last year and what you think may happen
[06:45] with inflation, which is just not going
[06:47] to happen without gas prices going
[06:49] higher. That is the weak link in AI is
[06:51] oil and power needed. Retail sales came
[06:55] out. This is overlaid with nominal GDP.
[06:57] Retail sales basically close to the
[06:59] highest level since 2021. So they're
[07:01] cutting. We have strong retail sales
[07:03] year-over-year, which was not what
[07:05] people were expecting. And that's
[07:07] because we do have a K-shaped economy.
[07:09] There's two economies right now. Here's
[07:11] what's happening in terms of after tax
[07:13] wages and salaries by household income.
[07:16] This is the impact that is going to
[07:17] continue to be pressuring because of
[07:20] technology and because of rates being at
[07:22] higher levels. The stability in the
[07:25] economy just continues to shift. And
[07:27] again, I wanted to show this just to
[07:28] show um the charts of just how much of
[07:32] consumption in this country now is from
[07:34] people above the age of 55. This red
[07:36] line here is the percentage of people
[07:38] above the age of 65. This is a So when
[07:41] you get through these numbers and you
[07:43] combine them, these are massive numbers
[07:45] of people that are basically leaving the
[07:47] labor force and spending money. I showed
[07:50] this back in August. This continues to
[07:52] go higher for people who keep sending me
[07:54] things about PMIs. I don't know how a
[07:57] hedge fund person in the world cannot be
[07:59] focused on what is happening with inside
[08:01] the commercial side due to data centers
[08:04] and be constantly pressing back on PMIs
[08:08] that will change going forward because
[08:10] of the demand and the shortages that are
[08:12] showing up. So the Dodge momentum index
[08:15] soared again on the commercial side. All
[08:17] sectors sustain momentum over the month
[08:20] notably led by strength in data centers.
[08:22] If all data center projects between 2023
[08:24] and 2025 were excluded, planning would
[08:26] still be up 38%
[08:28] year a year ago. The largest commercial
[08:31] projects include 500 million Big Sky
[08:33] data center, battery storage, data
[08:36] center, blah blah blah. We've got a
[08:38] tremendous boom going on in AI and Trump
[08:41] is fixated on the manufacturing and
[08:43] bringing stuff back for security
[08:44] purposes. So team explores government
[08:47] back manufacturing boost
[08:50] housing. I've talked about their desire
[08:52] to declare a national emergency. Expect
[08:54] that to come. And here's what's
[08:56] happening already. They're bringing down
[08:57] mortgage spread. So, 30-year fixed rate
[09:00] mortgages,
[09:02] lowest level since late 2022. This is
[09:06] inverted. Here are the mortgage apps.
[09:08] This orange line here is the mortgage
[09:10] applications. You're starting to see it
[09:12] flow through.
[09:16] fact that the Fed is about to cut rates
[09:17] while animal spirits are rampid brings
[09:19] back the postltcm easing cycle. Um, I
[09:22] only bring this up because
[09:26] cutting when there's not a recession is
[09:28] a big deal. Cutting when you're within
[09:29] 2% of all-time highs to shoot against it
[09:33] the next year going back the 20 times
[09:37] 100% were up the following year. Could
[09:39] it not happen this time? Of course. But
[09:42] when you read through, cutting at
[09:44] all-time highs is not something that you
[09:46] would expect to fade if you just talked
[09:48] about it. For some reason, people are
[09:50] focused on the other side. And it's not
[09:51] just a US thing. MSCI Aqui all country
[09:56] world index continues to make new highs
[09:58] with 75 74% of its constituents trading
[10:00] above the 200 day moving average. So
[10:02] technically, it's there. It's
[10:03] complemented by earnings momentum and
[10:05] breath. This is not something minor and
[10:08] revisions ripping higher still. So this
[10:12] 10W week average is now up to 0.22.
[10:16] We still are going to have some other
[10:17] things fall out which are going to
[10:18] continue to keep it. This is a PMI
[10:21] overlay, a tide that lifts all boats.
[10:24] Now when you go through fact set,
[10:28] so this is Trump back in 2018
[10:32] once we started to see the earnings
[10:34] calls not mentioned tariffs as much and
[10:36] we saw the second derivative, the rate
[10:38] of change improve. This is when stocks
[10:41] bottom. This is when they were bad
[10:42] during this period. This is when stocks
[10:45] were bad, then they we make a bottom,
[10:48] then you go. The rate of change is what
[10:51] matters. People adjust, companies
[10:53] adjust. Uncertainty. Remember how we got
[10:55] all these uncertainty things? How big of
[10:57] a deal it was? It was. And stocks went
[10:59] down. Now the rate of change is coming
[11:01] down sharply on uncertainty. Inflation.
[11:05] Remember policy mistake in the earnings
[11:07] calls. inflation completely coming down
[11:09] still despite the tariffs. This is
[11:12] probably the most important one.
[11:14] Everyone talking about tariffs on
[11:15] inflation and everything else. We still
[11:17] have all of this coming down and here's
[11:20] the way it looks overlaid with CPI. So
[11:22] again, we don't have anything going on
[11:24] and without the tariffs doing it, which
[11:26] is shocking. You're going to need gas at
[11:29] the pump to go higher. We are going to
[11:30] have inflation for transformers, for
[11:32] turbines, for generators. I'm going to
[11:34] go through this stuff later, but for the
[11:36] most point, don't worry about it.
[11:38] Everyone who talks about the US market
[11:40] being overvalued, of which it is a drum
[11:43] beat of macro people talking about
[11:45] valuations without mentioning margins,
[11:47] without mentioning return on equity.
[11:50] This is how long this has gone on. If
[11:52] you've been bearish US equity market
[11:54] since many, many people said it was
[11:56] overvalued, you've really paid a price
[11:59] watching this go this way. So 91% say
[12:02] it's overvalued. not the best way to do
[12:04] it. And here's the sentiment. So, this
[12:06] was at the beginning of the week, uh,
[12:08] September 12th. I'm just shocked that
[12:11] we're not up here like we were when the
[12:13] market peaked. So, again, try to figure
[12:16] out ways that people are not bearish. I
[12:18] wrote a uh a substack and two pieces for
[12:22] 22V this week. And one of the things I
[12:24] highlighted was this AAI bear. This is
[12:27] the fiveweek average. It's just shocking
[12:30] to me where we are on this. So what I
[12:31] did is I took all the times over the
[12:34] course of the last 23 years. These these
[12:37] vertical lines here are the points that
[12:40] we hit that level. In every case the
[12:43] stock market had fallen. This is the
[12:45] only time that you have bearish
[12:47] sentiment like this with stocks ripping
[12:50] higher and at alltime highs. All of
[12:52] these were after either major
[12:53] corrections, major corrections, not
[12:55] small ones, 15 to 20% or the beginning
[12:59] of something really bad or some
[13:00] consolidation that had lasted period of
[13:02] time. So again, that one's there. And
[13:05] then this one I highlighted just in one
[13:07] of the papers as well. This is where the
[13:09] umish came out last week.
[13:12] 55.4. There's two points here, two
[13:16] points here, and one point in in here
[13:19] that we were this level or lower. And in
[13:22] every one of those cases, it was after a
[13:24] 20 plus% fall in stocks. Again, people
[13:28] are not positive. This is not just an
[13:30] equity thing. This is not just a AI
[13:32] bubble thing. This is actually about the
[13:35] state of the economy we're in. I'm
[13:37] writing a Substack right now on the the
[13:39] convergence of the fourth turning and
[13:42] Joseph Shumper's creative destruction.
[13:44] And instead of sitting there predicting
[13:46] when this will go, I am the most bearish
[13:49] person because of AI. But that's just
[13:51] further down the road. For the time
[13:53] being, we're in the game of making money
[13:56] and sentiment remains way too negative
[13:58] for where we are right now. and the
[14:00] fight the current fight the government's
[14:01] trying to do in terms of running the
[14:04] economy hot to get us out of this while
[14:06] the acceleration of AI is directly
[14:09] happening now. So this article came out
[14:13] and again all the posts are about how
[14:15] this is a sign that the AI bubble is
[14:18] happening. The economist is known to
[14:20] write things when a bubble's in except
[14:22] for the fact that the economist framed
[14:24] the $3 trillion piece. I asked Chat GBT
[14:28] to go through the article and on a scale
[14:30] of 1 to 10 with one being bearish, 10
[14:32] being bullish, is this a bullish or a
[14:35] bearish headline, uh, four closer to
[14:38] bearish than bullish. Basically, it goes
[14:40] through the fact of all these things.
[14:42] So, when Oracle came out last week while
[14:45] I was in Vegas, I figured when I came
[14:47] back and I did all my weekly
[14:49] conversations
[14:51] with people that they'd be shocked at
[14:53] the Oracle numbers. Instead, they're all
[14:56] talking about this stuff.
[14:58] They're never going to How are their
[15:00] margins going to do? They're in it's a
[15:02] it's a bubble. Sign of a bubble. This we
[15:04] can't trust Larry Ellison. They don't
[15:06] they're going to have to issue debt the
[15:08] valuation of the company. I can't
[15:10] believe what I listen to. Guys, this is
[15:13] about the demand side of AI. You can
[15:15] doubt forever and ever, but markets tell
[15:18] you if you're right. If there was really
[15:20] a problem to start with with the debt
[15:22] side as this article goes through,
[15:24] you're seeing all these massive capex
[15:27] numbers. Okay, you can either invest in
[15:29] it because it's going to happen because
[15:30] we're only here or you can avoid it.
[15:34] These are numbers that are going to
[15:36] happen and it's not just the US, it is
[15:38] around the globe. And so what would be
[15:41] happening if people were worried about
[15:42] the debt? The spreads would be widening.
[15:44] Junk spreads would be widening.
[15:46] Something would be widening. Not sitting
[15:47] at all-time tights. So, let the let the
[15:49] market tell you when it's time to doubt
[15:52] it and we'll all get bearish together.
[15:54] Now, I wrote this paper at the beginning
[15:56] of the week because of the disbelief
[15:59] that was out there and it goes through a
[16:02] lot of different things that I talked
[16:03] about, but it really goes through the
[16:04] numbers and just how important this is
[16:06] from an economic basis. So, then we get
[16:08] the Nvidia
[16:10] Intel deal and I write this one which is
[16:13] all about the new semi semiconductor
[16:15] inflection. So there's two data points
[16:17] that have come out in a week. One is
[16:18] Oracle reports at number and talks about
[16:20] inference. Then you have this where
[16:23] again
[16:24] two large semiconductor companies are
[16:27] signaling what the next stage to invest
[16:29] in is in AI. Now on the first paper I
[16:34] wrote about inference back after Q1
[16:36] earnings reports and I published the
[16:38] paper on May 15th that it was the
[16:40] inference moment. In there, I
[16:42] highlighted 22 companies that would
[16:44] benefit from the growth in inference
[16:46] that was starting to accelerate. Now,
[16:48] this was all based on about 13 to 15
[16:51] companies that I listed where there was
[16:53] direct quotes in their earnings reports
[16:56] on how much inference was starting to
[16:58] pick up dramatically, which again is a
[17:00] sign of adoption. This is why when these
[17:03] reports come out, they are meant for
[17:04] clickbait. They are meant to go through.
[17:06] If you do your own work and you just
[17:07] believe that the market knows, here's
[17:10] May 15th when I released it. These are
[17:12] the names that make it up. They're up
[17:14] 30%.
[17:16] Since May to September, that's four
[17:19] months. It's an annualized 120%. The S&P
[17:22] is up 13%. If you just follow what is
[17:26] out there, I'm not a bottoms up analyst.
[17:29] I'm just using AI to help me find
[17:31] things. On that note,
[17:35] a master prompt. This is only a piece of
[17:37] it to go through the supply chain
[17:39] analysis of the AI inference buildout
[17:41] catalyst. This is for me to come up with
[17:45] 25 to 50 names as to what is going to be
[17:48] part of this. This master prompt that I
[17:51] do ended up being five times the size of
[17:54] what you're seeing here to go through.
[17:58] So then I wrote after I did that one now
[18:00] connect the announced Nvidia Intel deal
[18:02] to the statements from the company. So
[18:03] basically I'm taking the Oracle data
[18:06] point and what they said what companies
[18:09] across the spectrum should benefit and
[18:11] then connected it to the Intel Nvidia
[18:14] deal to give me then two data points to
[18:17] come up with this. So I just want to
[18:19] take you through where this all comes
[18:20] out. So the Nvidia Intel partnership can
[18:23] be matched up with the Tesla Samsung
[18:25] partnership. These deals point towards
[18:28] edge devices. If you don't know what an
[18:30] edge device is, spend time on
[18:34] AI asking it. You have to learn it. This
[18:37] is going to be the next stage. I've
[18:39] talked about this the phases, but we're
[18:41] going to go through it now. Training was
[18:43] the first one. That's the one where
[18:45] Nvidia really benefited the most. This
[18:47] is the one mainly about GPUs. Then we
[18:49] get into the inference scaling. We're
[18:51] still using GPUs, but now we're
[18:52] broadening it out. You're getting into
[18:54] other components. And this is what
[18:56] you're starting to see now. The next
[18:58] phase which again is going to start next
[19:01] year in my opinion. It's one of the
[19:02] reasons I wrote the Tesla piece. It's
[19:04] one of the reasons I'm focused more on
[19:05] the power side now is the embodiment and
[19:07] edge AI. These
[19:11] need the brain. So all we're doing right
[19:13] now is teaching this thing to learn
[19:16] everything from high school and college.
[19:19] This stage is where it's learning to
[19:21] think. It's taking the knowledge it
[19:22] gained in high school and college and
[19:24] it's making decisions by thinking
[19:26] through. This is the adoption phase.
[19:28] This is where the AI agent side is going
[19:30] to accelerate. This is when you need to
[19:32] have the brain. These are cloud-based.
[19:35] This one cannot be cloud-based. You
[19:37] can't have humanoids going to the cloud
[19:39] to get their uh information and then
[19:41] come out and make decisions. So, there's
[19:43] different things that are needed here.
[19:44] But the new term, not GPUs, not CPUs,
[19:48] NPUs.
[19:51] CPUs. You guys all know what those are.
[19:53] Those are very big before we got to the
[19:56] importance of GPUs for the cloud. Well,
[19:59] now we're going to get into NPUs. This
[20:01] is for the thinking on the spot. This is
[20:03] the decision-making. This is the thing I
[20:04] talked about with Tesla. The push back
[20:06] that came on Tesla. If you don't know
[20:08] what an NPU is, you have no business
[20:10] talking about Tesla. It is not a car
[20:12] company. It is an NPU company. End of
[20:15] story. Humanoids, robo taxis, that's it.
[20:17] So, if you're negative on Tesla, go
[20:19] study NPUs so you can at least have an
[20:22] informed opinion about what the man is
[20:24] trying to do and how important it is for
[20:26] the next five years of their business
[20:28] and why he could get a trillion dollars
[20:30] because of NPUs.
[20:34] As you go through this, this is really
[20:36] important in terms of the ED edge
[20:37] devices. And this is not just humanoids
[20:39] and robots. This is robo taxis. Anything
[20:42] that makes a decision. This includes
[20:43] your phone. This includes the computer.
[20:46] The reason we can't have Siri work the
[20:48] way it should, it's really hard to go
[20:50] back to the cloud and come back down in
[20:51] information. You want the thinking to be
[20:53] done on the device, that's what we're
[20:55] getting into as the next phase. And this
[20:57] week, Meta launches smart glasses. This
[20:59] is all part of the same thing. This
[21:01] thing needs to have a brain in it for it
[21:03] to do what it needs to do. It's not
[21:05] there yet, but we're going to get there.
[21:07] Now, one of the outputs on that and I
[21:09] did another routine. If you guys want to
[21:10] see the names on this for this next
[21:13] stage, John Rog went through did his
[21:16] technical scoring. I went through and
[21:18] got the output of all the different
[21:19] names. There's a lot of names on here
[21:21] and many of them because of the MPUs.
[21:23] So, MPUs need CPUs. CPUs are the things
[21:28] that went in washing machines, in autos.
[21:30] Again, guys, think PMIs, PMIs, PMIs.
[21:34] This is where we translate the next one.
[21:36] So here's one ASML
[21:40] one of the major things they are
[21:42] important in this they're one of the
[21:43] names on the list
[21:46] is this what is critical for the brain
[21:47] and the machine
[21:49] and this is yes EUV lithography where
[21:52] ASML has a monopoly I love monopolies
[21:55] when I'm investing is absolutely
[21:56] critical for producing the advanced
[21:58] chips that serve as the brain and AI
[21:59] native devices robo taxis and humanoid
[22:01] robots so it would make sense for ASML
[22:04] to be basically unchanged Since 2021,
[22:07] while the PMI has been unchanged,
[22:09] it wasn't needed as much because we were
[22:12] in the cloud. We didn't need ASML chips
[22:14] as much. We didn't need them to be doing
[22:16] what they were doing. So now
[22:20] you're getting more their back order
[22:21] backlog of the minute stood at third
[22:23] multi. You can just read through this
[22:25] stuff on your own. It's also necessary
[22:28] for batteries, which I'm going to get
[22:30] into as well. So the impact on AI native
[22:33] devices, robo taxis, and humanoids. If
[22:35] you wait for this stuff, it will already
[22:38] be higher. And the reason is because
[22:41] retail's already involved in this. This
[22:44] is the thing. When I hear and I meet
[22:46] people on the retail, they're really
[22:48] good traders. They're communicating via
[22:51] social media. They're finding these n
[22:53] names. They're doing the same thing I'm
[22:55] doing. So, if you're sitting there as a
[22:57] hedge fund, as an analyst, and you're
[22:59] wondering how retail could possibly be
[23:02] right, they're putting in the work and
[23:04] they're doing the homework and they're
[23:06] going through the same thing that I'm
[23:07] going here. So, if you want the
[23:09] information, reach out to the 22V
[23:11] people. I'll go through it. I'll even
[23:13] show you how to do the things that are
[23:14] on there if you want. If not, you can
[23:17] wait for Goldman Sachs and Morgan
[23:18] Stanley to actually produce the
[23:19] research. It's never going to come
[23:21] because there has to be a timing
[23:23] element. And the timing element has to
[23:25] do with the trading side. The trading
[23:26] side is getting away. And it looks like
[23:28] they're expensive, but that's what
[23:30] happened to Bloom Energy. That's what's
[23:32] happening with a lot of the names that I
[23:33] showed last week and things like Babcock
[23:36] and Willox. These things just move and
[23:39] they're gone. And you have to be on top
[23:41] of them because they start moving before
[23:42] the actual data comes through. Can you
[23:45] talk about the importance of the battery
[23:47] for both the inference, scaling, and
[23:48] embodimenting stage? So the next stage
[23:50] that I want people to really understand
[23:52] as I segue, batteries are necessary in
[23:56] the same way the brains are. You need a
[23:58] lot more battery and a lot more inside
[24:00] the devices for them to be able to run
[24:02] properly. Unlike data centers, edge AI
[24:05] runs off local battery packs from
[24:07] smartphones to EV packs powering robo
[24:09] taxis and humanoids. Power per inference
[24:12] watt efficiency.
[24:14] This is critical as you guys think about
[24:16] the next phase. So
[24:19] Oracle and talks with Meta on $20
[24:21] billion AI cloud computing deal. So
[24:23] after all the stuff with Oracle last
[24:25] week where people doubted it, there's a
[24:27] conversation about another deal. This
[24:28] one with Meta. At the same time, Meta
[24:30] pushes into power trading as AI sends
[24:33] demand soaring. So the power side, where
[24:35] are you going to get it from? Meta is
[24:37] seeking authorization to participate in
[24:39] the wholesale power trading business to
[24:40] manage its data center electricity
[24:42] needs. Again, the extreme nature of how
[24:44] much of a power shortage we're going to
[24:46] have is why people are doing this. Now,
[24:49] a report that I went through post uh
[24:52] Oracle from myself, surging backlogs and
[24:55] unprecedented forward visibility. Okay,
[24:58] so just the backlogs that are there, a
[25:02] global construction boom for AI
[25:03] factories, massive capex outlays,
[25:06] specific large-scale projects. This
[25:08] rapid expansion is hitting physical
[25:10] limits. Power availability is now the
[25:12] primary criterion for site selection. We
[25:15] are we have bottlenecks building up
[25:16] everywhere. PMIs are going higher. PMIs
[25:20] are going higher. NextG hardware roll
[25:23] out. So the hardware procurement on this
[25:27] the supply bottlenecks they're
[25:28] everywhere. Their gas turbines, their
[25:30] generators, their transformers, their
[25:32] cooling systems. And the backlog is
[25:34] going further and further into the
[25:35] future. We also have DRAM. So, if you've
[25:38] wondered why Micron, which again I
[25:39] referenced a while ago when I first got
[25:41] to it to uh 22V and I've talked about on
[25:45] Pomp many times, uh has reportedly been
[25:48] forced to freeze pricing on DRM and nan
[25:50] as AI demand causes shortages. Lead
[25:52] times for high capacity hard drives have
[25:54] extended to a year. The demand is
[25:56] reflected in the bullish forecast from
[25:58] key suppliers. It just doesn't stop.
[26:00] Now, most people have heard about this.
[26:02] Gas turbine manufacturers expand
[26:04] capacity but order backlog could prove
[26:06] stubborn. Gas power boom spark a turbine
[26:08] supply crunch. So what I did was I know
[26:12] from everything that I'm reading that
[26:14] the situation on the turbines is taking
[26:16] us out 5 years. Everyone I talked to
[26:18] who's invested in it who who's invested
[26:21] in GE Vernova Seaman's Energy Mitsubishi
[26:24] they know this inside and out. But the
[26:26] real thing is that they don't know AI
[26:29] demand is going faster than we expected.
[26:31] That's what the Oracle news was. Instead
[26:33] of fading it, the demand is going far
[26:36] faster than we anticipated and the
[26:38] products keep coming out. So the
[26:40] shortage is getting worse and worse. The
[26:42] demand is growing. When demand is
[26:44] growing faster and the supply not only
[26:45] has a bottleneck, the turbines cannot
[26:48] possibly meet the numbers that people
[26:51] want. So natural gas is not going to be
[26:53] the story. In fact, what I wanted to do
[26:56] is say, okay, putting all together the
[26:58] shortage that we have with the demand,
[27:01] what will gas turbines solve out of the
[27:04] entire equation that's likely necessary
[27:06] from the high case, we are tracking
[27:07] right now above the high case. Roughly
[27:10] 1/3 to 2/3 of the high case. So, let's
[27:13] assume about half is going to be from
[27:15] natural gas from the turbines. That
[27:17] means the rest of it is coming from
[27:18] these other areas, which means the most
[27:22] scalable near-term fillers. New nuclear
[27:24] is a post2030 contributor. So there's a
[27:27] tremendous amount of places and this is
[27:29] why I wrote this report on hybrid
[27:31] solutions. And just as machines only
[27:32] delivered efficiency once they were
[27:34] plugged into electricity, AI only
[27:36] realizes its potential when plugged into
[27:38] the vast compute and data infrastructure
[27:41] that's needed. So for everyone looking
[27:44] for ideas, just stick with compute and
[27:47] stick with power. It will get you to the
[27:50] endgame. The problem is you need to talk
[27:52] to people that can speak both languages.
[27:54] You need the demand side on the AI side
[27:56] because if you talk to someone on the
[27:57] compressor side, they say, "Well, it all
[27:59] depends on what the AI demand side is."
[28:01] Well, to get the AI demand side, you got
[28:03] to talk to a technology person and
[28:04] actually get the Oracle thing. Since
[28:06] most people are negative on this stuff
[28:07] or don't understand that this is a
[28:10] national security issue that goes far
[28:13] deep and something that they can't turn
[28:15] around on and it's funded with cash.
[28:17] There's no signs that this won't be
[28:20] done. Now outside of outside of
[28:24] shortages and transformers and cooling
[28:26] systems and turbines, there is a
[28:28] shortage of largecale generators as
[28:31] well. So, if you're wondering where
[28:34] there's many spots, and I've listened to
[28:36] a bunch of podcasts this week on this,
[28:38] it's a perfect storm as is in here. Uh,
[28:42] we need to be able to have backup power
[28:45] and this is going to mean generators.
[28:47] And so, what you've seen is so far both
[28:49] Caterpillar and Cummings have strongly
[28:51] highlighted surging generator and power
[28:53] systems. Now, Caterpillar is also um
[28:55] getting other things from the AI side.
[28:58] And I wanted to show this because
[28:59] Caterpillar is purely an AI company at
[29:01] this point. Uh their power generation
[29:06] revenue is now 14.5% of total company
[29:09] sales. And if you go on the growth rate,
[29:11] you're dealing with 28% year-over-year.
[29:13] These numbers are only going to grow
[29:15] bigger and bigger.
[29:17] So you have to make sure that you
[29:19] understand the energy and transportation
[29:21] se segment where data center generators
[29:23] recorded outpaced construction machinery
[29:25] and revenue for the first time in 24 and
[29:27] 25. This is why the PMIs haven't gone
[29:29] higher yet but they were starting to go
[29:31] higher. It takes a while for the data
[29:34] center construction numbers to get above
[29:36] commercial real estate which is what's
[29:38] happened now. Same thing goes for
[29:40] Caterpillar. So at some point here the
[29:43] sales start mattering for these
[29:45] companies and they start to be driving
[29:47] and the same thing will happen with PMI.
[29:49] So if you've missed Cummings here's the
[29:51] chart of it. It's an AI company. You can
[29:53] go look at where it is now and where it
[29:55] was a year ago and how these companies
[29:58] are making money in an environment where
[30:00] there is a recession happening in PMIs.
[30:04] This is a scary thing to see that this
[30:06] is happening and it will spread because
[30:08] it's a tide that lifts all boats because
[30:09] the bottlenecks are growing. So with
[30:12] Oracle's numbers last week for demand,
[30:13] will this put more pressure on the grid?
[30:16] So I expanded this and said, well, what
[30:18] other generator companies? I did another
[30:19] list. I went through and I looked for
[30:22] small cap, midcap places and maybe ones
[30:24] that wouldn't be the first place to go.
[30:26] And Generrack came up on a bunch of
[30:27] things.
[30:29] uh mainly because
[30:31] that's not where their traditional
[30:32] business has been. So where you go is
[30:36] then you start going through it. Data
[30:38] centers obviously are prime target. Also
[30:40] our existing customers they are all
[30:42] require larger blocks of backup power as
[30:44] well. So if you've been historically not
[30:46] talking to the hyperscalers but you were
[30:48] talking to the utilities, you've already
[30:49] seen the demand. So you can go through
[30:51] and read the quotes on your own in terms
[30:53] of what's already happening. The market
[30:55] is in an early cycle of very strong
[30:57] long-term growth driven by AI. The
[30:59] capital expenditure cycle for data
[31:01] centers could extend for many years
[31:02] driven by the AI trends. A robust
[31:05] pipeline and the company's first major
[31:08] international shipments first
[31:12] you're getting all the information you
[31:13] need. Um management repeatedly
[31:16] emphasized that demand for transformers
[31:17] and backup power is a critical concern
[31:19] for data center developers. They cannot
[31:22] have these things have to run 24/7.
[31:25] We have to find ways to use generators
[31:27] to make sure that happens on-site. It
[31:29] has to be from the grid in terms of
[31:31] making sure that peak demand can be
[31:33] extended. They're all types of gr
[31:35] optimization side. So if you look here's
[31:38] Generrack charts good from the lows, but
[31:41] basically it's unchanged since November.
[31:43] So in looking for names, go through and
[31:46] see where you can find them. And that
[31:48] brings us to the next thing, and I
[31:50] showed this last week. So when I say
[31:51] Tesla is working on the brain for
[31:53] humanoids and robo taxis,
[31:56] they're also bringing the Mega Blok.
[31:59] Tesla's new Mega Block system can power
[32:01] 400,000 homes in under a month. Tesla is
[32:05] not a car company. They are an AI
[32:07] company. Everything that they do is
[32:09] related to the brain and to making sure
[32:12] there's enough power. And batteries,
[32:14] which is a focal point of Tesla, is now
[32:17] starting to become a major trend because
[32:20] we're entering the stage where batteries
[32:22] become most important. Everyone has
[32:24] probably touched batteries before, got
[32:26] invested. They're very speculative. We
[32:28] need batteries now like never before,
[32:30] and it's only going to increase going
[32:31] forward. China to supercharge energy
[32:34] storage tech with worldleading
[32:36] advancements. I highlighted this yellow
[32:38] stuff there just to make sure that I
[32:40] knew what it was. says the items circle
[32:42] in yellow in the image are large scale
[32:43] battery en energy storage containers.
[32:46] Think mega blocks. Think what's going
[32:48] on? China's battery makers get boost on
[32:50] hopes for advancements. We will get
[32:52] advancements in batteries. Batteries
[32:54] have to go through an innovation
[32:56] finally. There's going to be an enormous
[32:57] amount of dollars thrown in the pace and
[32:59] these names are going to be a place you
[33:00] want to look. So CL the biggest battery
[33:03] maker in the world jumps on JP Morgan
[33:05] upgrade on the China energy storage
[33:07] plan. again, PMIs peak here going
[33:12] higher. I can do this all day with the
[33:14] PMIs. Um, here is the Chinese battery
[33:18] company. And now all of a sudden you've
[33:21] got lit, which is the ETF for batteries
[33:24] in the US, which has been correlated,
[33:27] still correlated, but now you're
[33:28] starting to see the battery thing show
[33:30] up in the US. So, if you go into X and
[33:34] you go follow retail, what's retail
[33:35] looking at? Well, they're looking at
[33:37] NRGV as one of them, which has ripped
[33:39] higher in the last two days. And again,
[33:41] this will show up as speculative memes.
[33:43] This, that the reality is, if you go do
[33:47] your own homework on these names, you
[33:48] will find they're not. They are doing
[33:50] stuff in AI. I mentioned this one a
[33:52] couple times uh in public speaking
[33:54] engagements, and I talked to someone in
[33:56] August about the fact that this name
[33:58] kept showing up on all of my podcasts
[34:00] for energies and batteries, and who was
[34:02] already working on this, and it was this
[34:04] company, EOS. Uh EOS was up huge this
[34:08] week. It's up big. I It could be
[34:12] speculative or it could be the fact that
[34:14] EOS executives have stated on earning
[34:16] calls that big hyperscalers and
[34:18] developers are coming to EOS because of
[34:19] its American supply chain cost effective
[34:21] relation.
[34:24] It frequently cites the rising demand as
[34:26] a driver of EOS pipeline. And then
[34:29] here's their backlog.
[34:32] They talk about their backlog saying
[34:34] they're seeing strong signals ahead. And
[34:37] then
[34:40] this week they just announced a new
[34:41] major platform called Dawn OS in
[34:43] September. It's purposebuilt for the
[34:46] battery systems designed to enhance
[34:48] advanced control automation and system
[34:50] optimization for grid systems. EOS
[34:53] emphasized that Dawn OS was built based
[34:55] on direct customer feedback and is
[34:57] specifically designed for American
[34:59] security, energy security. Um, again,
[35:04] the reason I'm bringing this up now,
[35:06] this was September 11th before the big
[35:08] rally. I mentioned this stock. We've
[35:10] talked about Cummings. I've talked about
[35:12] Bloom Energy. Here's EOS.
[35:15] This is someone who barely has any
[35:16] views. Had 805
[35:20] views. Has barely any followers.
[35:23] This is the way the information spreads,
[35:24] guys. These names, they're following
[35:26] what's happening. They're paying
[35:27] attention to the deals that are being
[35:29] done. Um, oil again, some point next
[35:32] year, I believe oil will be high,
[35:33] especially while everyone is negative on
[35:35] it. Uh, why is China stockpiling so much
[35:38] oil? I think every country is
[35:40] stockpiling BTUs. Um, so energy will be
[35:44] a major theme next year because we have
[35:45] bottlenecks and everything. China bans
[35:47] its biggest tech companies from
[35:48] acquiring Nvidia chips. This was a big
[35:51] story this week. David Saxs highlighted
[35:53] why this or how this is a big story and
[35:56] just showed that, okay, they're not
[35:59] needing to buy our chips.
[36:01] They're not buying our soybeans
[36:05] and they're still messing around with
[36:07] the world on rare earth. Companies in
[36:09] the EU incurred seven production
[36:10] stoppages in August because of the
[36:12] shortfalls of rare earth. All this feeds
[36:15] into
[36:18] the deal with China. I'm going to
[36:19] reiterate again since you're looking for
[36:22] information on what things will happen
[36:24] between now and the end of the year.
[36:26] China is clearly showing their leverage
[36:29] before the negotiation is done. And
[36:32] Trump is saying he will meet she in
[36:35] APEC. Uh this is what Andy Rothman had
[36:38] talked about basically and wrote in on
[36:41] July 9th. the odds of a deal, the
[36:45] world's greatest deal, uh are more
[36:48] likely
[36:51] to close a deal around the time of the
[36:52] APEC leader summit in Korea. So Andy's
[36:54] been talking about this. Um a deal is
[36:57] not a sure thing, but the odds are
[36:58] higher enough that investors should
[36:59] think about how they would take
[37:00] advantage of the potential impact on
[37:02] Chinese equity markets. I find it
[37:04] impossible given the importance of rare
[37:06] earth uh that there isn't a deal. Uh we
[37:09] don't have enough rare earth. I'll get
[37:10] into that in a second. Uh, if there's a
[37:13] deal and if you want to start looking
[37:15] for options and things to play as you
[37:17] get closer to that point,
[37:20] ChachiPT5 Pro is really good at giving
[37:22] you a bunch of places that you can go
[37:24] put some go look and see where the
[37:26] options are. Go see where things are.
[37:28] Again, you've got all these different
[37:30] places of places that you can play. One
[37:32] of them is semiconductors and equipment.
[37:35] if there's a deal just just suggesting
[37:38] US dependence on China for rare earth
[37:40] elements sparks security concerns so
[37:43] knowing that we don't have the labor we
[37:46] don't have the expertise in mining and
[37:48] we have permitting issues along with
[37:51] many environmental delays that would
[37:53] occur where are we going to get our rare
[37:56] earth from 5 years from now so a deal
[37:59] I'm sure will be that they will supply
[38:00] our rare earth but this is going to be a
[38:02] deal that obviously is going to end at
[38:04] some point. And so where do we get them?
[38:06] So the countries again, Australia and
[38:08] Canada. Great. I wanted to find
[38:11] countries that had the labor, they had
[38:14] the ability to get this done, and they
[38:16] had the mining experience. The ones I
[38:18] want to focus on are Brazil and Chile.
[38:21] We'll get into them later, but there are
[38:24] a number of US companies that are
[38:26] developing, deploying. All this work
[38:27] again is in AI. Where can I find
[38:30] companies that are in the forefront of
[38:32] rare earth recycling?
[38:36] American Resources Corporation. The
[38:38] company is focused on the critical
[38:39] midstream of the supply chain separation
[38:41] and purification. It's sub
[38:44] blah blah blah. American Resources
[38:46] Inc.'s with Pasco to boost rare earth
[38:50] supply chain. That was this week.
[38:53] And here's what the stock has done. It's
[38:55] a small cap stock. Again, you're going
[38:56] to see all of this stuff go on. And if
[38:58] you do your homework, you can find these
[39:00] names. It's the gift that keeps on
[39:02] giving because once they get orders,
[39:03] they continue to go. AI is not stopping
[39:06] for the next four or five years. And
[39:08] there's no surprises that are coming
[39:10] other than the fact that we could run
[39:12] out of power. And so energy plus AI
[39:15] equals a good way to make sure that
[39:17] you're covered. Now, the metals, John Ro
[39:19] has been highlighting this stuff.
[39:21] Commodities, commodities, commodities,
[39:23] but in particular, we need tons of
[39:25] copper. You've known that. The chart
[39:26] looks great. He's highlighting the fact
[39:28] that that's going higher. The
[39:30] Bloomberg's uh commodity index, same
[39:33] thing. So, what I care about
[39:36] Oh, we're back to Brazil because when
[39:37] commodities are going higher, I want to
[39:39] be long Brazil having lived there. But
[39:41] also, I wrote this piece on a lot of
[39:44] different ra uh reasons. A lot of it has
[39:46] to do with their rare earth minerals.
[39:48] Now, we have the LME metals. Okay, so if
[39:52] copper is going higher, this will go
[39:54] higher. This is the relationship
[39:56] historically between EWZ and this part
[39:59] of my belief was that the dollar would
[40:00] be on a weakening trade. If you believe
[40:02] the dollar is going to be weaker, if you
[40:04] believe American exceptionalism is over,
[40:05] and I do believe the American dominance
[40:09] of coding is over and the dollar was
[40:12] representative for 30 years as the
[40:15] monopoly on coding, which has ended with
[40:18] artificial intelligence. So I believe
[40:20] we're in a long-term shift here where
[40:22] the democratization of AI means that the
[40:25] mag 7 don't have that software doesn't
[40:28] have it and we get more into the
[40:29] hardware stage
[40:31] EWZ
[40:34] and if you don't like EWZ just look here
[40:37] is an great year for the S&P up 13.3%.
[40:42] The Mag 7 now up 20%. Sorry, Mag 7. This
[40:48] This is year to date. And here's what
[40:50] we've got up here. These are all up 34
[40:52] to 44%. This is Brazil. This is China.
[40:55] This is Mexico. Uh and this is Chile.
[40:58] That's where I'd be focusing my
[41:00] attention. To finish up, Bitcoin chart's
[41:03] still great. It's still stuck. Um, we're
[41:06] doing the usual routine, and I hate to
[41:08] say it, but the hedging that seems to go
[41:10] on to the end of every quarter until we
[41:12] get out of the quarter, it seems like
[41:13] it's stuck in this 110 to 120 area.
[41:16] Eventually, it will go higher. And part
[41:18] of the reason that it's in a structural
[41:20] bull market is this one. A majority of
[41:23] fund manager survey investors are not
[41:25] allocated to crypto at all with 60 uh
[41:29] with August uh September. Now, 67% have
[41:32] a 0% waiting. Uh 8% or more, next to
[41:37] know it. That's it for this week, guys.
[41:39] Have a good one. Reach out to 22V if you
[41:42] want to talk about any of the work that
[41:43] I showed in here and if you want to
[41:45] start having some uh classes on how to
[41:48] do the work that I did on here. See you.
