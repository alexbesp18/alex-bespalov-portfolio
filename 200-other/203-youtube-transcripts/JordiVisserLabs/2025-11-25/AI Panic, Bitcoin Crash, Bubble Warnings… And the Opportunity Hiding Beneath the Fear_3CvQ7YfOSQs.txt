[00:00] doing this from Maine. Um, weekend
[00:03] before Thanksgiving,
[00:05] another brutal week, another scary week
[00:08] for people. Um, based on the calls I got
[00:12] and the people reaching out that started
[00:14] with, is everything going to be okay?
[00:17] Uh, I'll treat this week as one of the
[00:20] uh, scariest weeks based on people
[00:23] calling, but just really nothing major
[00:26] happening from a scare perspective. Uh
[00:30] most of the news was good. Uh but we'll
[00:32] go through things and uh see what's
[00:34] happening. Uh thinking in bets uh I'll
[00:38] be talking about Annie Duke on this
[00:40] episode and hopefully for the people who
[00:42] are looking for some kind of calm to set
[00:44] in uh as they watch this. Uh I want you
[00:48] to just think in bets. Uh capitulation
[00:50] signs, more bubble warnings from AI. The
[00:53] AI credit stress fears came out. I had
[00:56] to deal with those this week. Um the
[00:58] reality with AI uh Gemini 3 came out
[01:01] this week. I'll go through that. Try to
[01:03] remind people uh to stay calm and for
[01:08] investors who have benefited this year
[01:10] by every time there's an AI bubble fear
[01:13] uh which again I think I said it last
[01:15] week I'm going to say it. You're going
[01:17] to be climbing a wall of worry of AI for
[01:19] the next five years. uh Bitcoin crash.
[01:22] Uh I'll go through that uh painful uh
[01:25] thing for me and uh all decisions at the
[01:28] end of the day are always bets on the
[01:31] future. So let's start off this way. Uh
[01:34] this was a a post uh that got 625,000
[01:38] views. S&P is down three and a half%
[01:40] from all-time highs. My portfolio is
[01:42] down 35% from all-time highs. That
[01:46] pretty much was about my thought process
[01:49] this time. I've I've uh I had a good
[01:51] year in terms of picking uh the right
[01:53] time back in the liberation time to put
[01:55] money to work. I have some great buys in
[01:58] Microns, some great buys in uh Nvidia.
[02:01] Uh lately've had some good uh Eli
[02:04] Liysies. But then on the other side, I
[02:06] have taken a bath uh on my Micro
[02:09] Strategy purchases which were done at
[02:11] the same time around Liberation Day plus
[02:13] some of the rally going and Bitcoin. And
[02:16] since uh a good portion of my net worth
[02:19] is in Bitcoin, uh it's been a uh it's
[02:22] been a a a bad week
[02:25] for my portfolio. And the reason I
[02:27] brought this guy up in terms of going
[02:29] through it, when you have 3,700
[02:31] followers and you put up a post that
[02:33] ends up going viral for 625,000, I think
[02:37] that sums up the way people are feeling
[02:39] right now. Thinking in bets. Uh, if you
[02:42] haven't read this, if you haven't
[02:43] purchased it for your kids yet, uh, I
[02:45] highly recommend it. Annie Duke is
[02:47] fantastic. Um, I had a, uh, a 90inute
[02:51] one-on-one conversation with her one day
[02:53] and we talked about so many different
[02:55] things. She's a brilliant lady. uh has a
[03:00] great mindset and because she's
[03:02] translated psychology and poker together
[03:05] uh this book I think for everyone to
[03:07] make it through the next five years I
[03:09] highly recommend thinking about it. Uh
[03:11] it's just a great way but it's really
[03:13] important for for kids. I've given it to
[03:17] um to many many people over the years.
[03:20] This is just a summary with from it. Um,
[03:23] just thinking in bets is a book about
[03:25] making smarter decisions when you don't
[03:26] have all the facts because in the real
[03:28] world you never do. It's really about
[03:30] the fact that every decision you make in
[03:31] life is a bet. Uh, and there you go.
[03:34] Every decision is a bet. Thinking in
[03:36] bets or decision tree. It really is just
[03:39] a great book for people to go through.
[03:41] But in particular, whenever you're
[03:43] letting your emotions run free because
[03:45] you think you know things that you
[03:47] don't, you have to get back to a process
[03:49] that's based on prob uh probabilities,
[03:52] uh and the outcome that'll come from it.
[03:54] So, um despite all the the fears that
[03:57] have gone on, uh and again, I I find it
[03:59] amazing. The S&P was down 1.8% for the
[04:02] week. Uh, and again, I I bring this up
[04:05] almost every week just to show you that
[04:07] since this week here in April, we've had
[04:12] such a massive move and every now and
[04:13] then we get a correction. And every time
[04:15] we get a correction like this, it's a
[04:18] bubble fear. It's a AI is going to
[04:21] collapse fear. It's a every single time.
[04:23] There's not one time that that doesn't
[04:25] occur. Uh, even if it's with the
[04:27] tariffs, it's because people believe
[04:29] we're in a bubble. the NDX little bit
[04:31] weaker down 3.13%.
[04:34] You can see that monthtodate when you
[04:35] add these three weeks in it's been a
[04:37] good size correction. So I don't want to
[04:39] minimize how much damage has been done.
[04:41] Uh but I'll put that uh a little bit
[04:43] more in perspective.
[04:45] Russell 2000 was only down 70 basis
[04:48] points for the week. So it outperformed
[04:50] uh and at one point on Friday it
[04:52] actually got back to unchanged for the
[04:54] week. uh nice close uh in terms of
[04:58] candlestick, but more importantly as an
[05:00] Aliot wave person, you have this day
[05:02] here which will you know is is is a day
[05:04] that people will talk about the fact
[05:06] that we gapped up uh a percent and a
[05:08] half and then we sold off and we're down
[05:10] a percent and a half and it's only
[05:12] happened four times in the last 30
[05:14] years. Uh, this looks very corrective,
[05:18] but the reason I brought this chart up
[05:19] is with the S&P fall, we've only given
[05:22] up 20% of the gain that had gone on. We
[05:26] finally closed below the 50-day moving
[05:28] average, which had to happen at some
[05:30] point, and we had this nice reversal day
[05:32] today. I bring this up just because keep
[05:34] your head on straight if you're going to
[05:36] make money going forward. But I'm going
[05:37] to go through the reasons why you want
[05:39] to keep your head on straight now. But
[05:41] this looks like a corrective move off
[05:42] all-time highs. Uh in terms of the
[05:44] NASDAQ, we've done a 26% correction. So
[05:48] again, or 24% correction. So again, we
[05:52] haven't done anything. And to make it
[05:54] even look worse, here are the
[05:56] year-to-ate numbers across the globe.
[05:58] This isn't just a US thing. This isn't
[06:01] just an AI bubble thing. In fact, the US
[06:04] is underperforming.
[06:06] And to call this a bubble when the S&P
[06:08] is up 12 and the NASDAQ is up 15 while
[06:11] all these other markets are up a lot
[06:12] more and when you do it in currency
[06:15] terms uh in the dollar it's even more in
[06:17] terms of investing overseas. So fear and
[06:20] greed index the CNN one uh got down to
[06:24] six basically the same level it was in
[06:27] liberation day. The VIX climbed up to
[06:30] 24. This is the fiveday average of it.
[06:33] So this takes out just kind of the
[06:35] movements and we close right around the
[06:37] 24 level. So again, you know, except for
[06:40] liberation day,
[06:42] this is a big move in the VIX. This is
[06:44] the VIX vol 5day. We're actually at the
[06:47] highest level except for liberation
[06:49] daytime.
[06:52] Equity put call ratio for for single
[06:55] name options, highest level since then.
[06:58] put volume jumped to the second highest
[07:00] reading ever uh historically.
[07:04] It was a good time uh in terms of buying
[07:07] this stuff the last times that it's
[07:09] happened over these years.
[07:11] And I just want to remind people when
[07:14] you overlay the VIX with junk spreads,
[07:18] this is what I care about. Um if things
[07:21] were bad, junk spreads would be
[07:23] widening. Uh I always had this uh uh
[07:26] line I've used funding funding spreads
[07:29] or the funding markets lead the credit
[07:31] market which leads the equity market and
[07:33] right now we don't have any stress in
[07:35] the junk bond market. Yes, we have
[07:37] stress in some other parts of the credit
[07:39] side in terms of private credit, but
[07:40] it's nothing as of now. It's isolated to
[07:43] that area and I think that's where it's
[07:44] going to remain despite the brilliant
[07:46] work of many many people saying the
[07:48] contagion is coming and I'm going to
[07:49] hear my teenth recession call uh since
[07:54] the great financial crisis. The S&P
[07:56] here's the correction in terms of the
[07:58] draw down 5.6%.
[08:00] I mean, it's not even a blip on here.
[08:02] And yet again, if you take any 5%
[08:06] correction we've had and compare the
[08:07] amount of panic I heard this week, I
[08:09] think on a relative basis, I've never
[08:11] heard this much panic relative to the
[08:13] size of the draw down. NDX, I mean an 8%
[08:16] draw down. I mean, look how many we had
[08:18] in 2020 dur this is during bull market
[08:21] times. Forget the bare market times
[08:23] because this is when it stayed down. But
[08:25] all these others, we went right back up
[08:27] eventually uh very quickly. I think the
[08:30] same thing will happen this time. If the
[08:32] AI bubble burst, a recession could
[08:34] follow. Um, The Economist has had a
[08:37] really high hit ratio for marking
[08:39] bottoms. So, the fact that they pin this
[08:41] on their uh
[08:44] their X feed uh gives me good hope. Um,
[08:48] I don't understand why Michael Bur's
[08:50] getting all this uh press, but
[08:51] regardless, he posted a chart showing
[08:54] how stocks peak before capital spending
[08:56] did in past investment booms. Yes, it is
[08:58] correct. I'll go through some other
[08:59] things that peaked. Stocks are a leading
[09:03] indicator for the economy. So, I agree
[09:06] with the fact that if you want to make
[09:07] the argument that we're in a bubble and
[09:09] that stocks will peak first, I
[09:10] completely agree, but you have to look
[09:12] at some other things, too. I've already
[09:14] shown you one of them, which is junk
[09:16] spreads. Jeff Gunlock,
[09:18] um I I mean, this guy's been wrong all
[09:22] year, but regardless, um warns of
[09:24] garbage lending and private credit
[09:26] booms. He also said um AI was overblown.
[09:30] That's all I needed to hear to basically
[09:32] say why listen to someone when the tip
[09:35] of the spear is AI. If you say something
[09:37] like it's overblown, then just short the
[09:40] market and just continue because if you
[09:42] really believe that AI is overblown,
[09:44] that getting intelligence into
[09:46] everything is overblown, then yeah, if I
[09:48] were you, I would be focusing on this.
[09:50] So, for the first time in 20 years, AI
[09:52] bubble fields have fund managers saying
[09:53] companies are overdoing it. I bring this
[09:55] up because
[09:57] this is
[09:59] the percentage of investors that think
[10:02] companies are overinvesting.
[10:05] So they complain that there wasn't any
[10:07] investment and now they're
[10:09] overinvesting. This was during the post
[10:11] great financial crisis period when
[10:13] everyone was getting their balance
[10:14] sheets. This is why I talked about the
[10:16] fact that QE is basically artificial
[10:20] intelligence
[10:24] in terms of the fact that uh we're going
[10:26] to be getting so many profit margins
[10:28] from the fact of reducing expenses and
[10:29] there's operating leverage multiplier on
[10:31] it uh that I think people should focus
[10:33] on that instead of that. Well, going
[10:35] backwards off on the right one. Um,
[10:37] Coreweave
[10:39] CDS, this was brought up to me this
[10:42] week, building in a roughly 40 to 45%
[10:45] chance the company defaults over the
[10:47] next 5 years. So, let me say um that I
[10:51] don't have a problem with this at all.
[10:54] Uh, do I think this is too high? Yeah.
[10:56] But do I think there's a 30 to 35%
[10:59] chance the company will have defaults
[11:01] over the next 5 years? As someone who's
[11:03] as bullish as I am on AI, yes, this is
[11:06] part of the thing that I think people
[11:08] have to expand. Number one, we're in a
[11:09] K-shaped economy, which means I don't
[11:11] expect the credit situation, the job
[11:13] situation to get any better. That is
[11:15] part of the bullish outlook for me with
[11:16] stocks and profit margins. I also
[11:19] believe that there's a chance a good
[11:21] chance that at some point two years into
[11:23] this we will have some artificial
[11:27] intelligence driven solution to power
[11:30] andor efficiency in a big way. Now when
[11:33] I say two years the more we build out
[11:36] the power the higher the probability of
[11:38] actually reaching a point in AI where we
[11:40] can figure out some solutions. I think
[11:43] that's why making any bets longer than
[11:45] five years when it comes to innovation
[11:48] and when it comes to things related to
[11:51] the stock market, I think you're playing
[11:53] at risk. This is a belief I have with
[11:56] everything related to AI that it
[11:57] cannibalizes everything and that it is
[11:59] impossible to predict what the world's
[12:01] going to look like 3 years from now. So,
[12:03] I don't have a problem with the CDS
[12:04] being up there. It doesn't mean we're in
[12:05] a bubble. It just means the credit
[12:08] market is starting to get smart with the
[12:09] fact that they may not be able to
[12:11] justify all the debt they're taking.
[12:13] Same thing with Oracle CDS. Again, I
[12:15] bring this up because don't focus on
[12:18] this until we start seeing signs. So, do
[12:20] you believe Jeff Gunlock when he says
[12:22] it's overblown? Do you believe the
[12:24] bubble fears from the economist? Do you
[12:25] believe all of the bubble talk? Or do
[12:28] you believe Eric Schmidt? I I just go if
[12:32] you're going to do anything this weekend
[12:33] to just get your brain back into check
[12:35] in a in a way that you can understand
[12:36] what's coming our way, just watch the AI
[12:39] revolution is under hype with Eric
[12:41] Schmidt. And just remember, he's not the
[12:43] CEO of a company. He's not sitting there
[12:45] doing this. He's actually doing things
[12:48] for the government. He's heavily
[12:51] involved. He's in the know of everything
[12:53] going on and he's talking about this
[12:55] stuff. It is here. It is real. It is
[12:57] now. Gemini 3 comes out. Best model in
[13:00] the world for multimmodal understanding.
[13:02] It's amazing. Having used it now for the
[13:04] last two days. If you want to go get the
[13:06] details on it because you were too
[13:07] caught up reading about AI bubble fears
[13:10] and worrying about the losses in your
[13:11] portfolio. This round table discussion
[13:13] reviewing
[13:15] Gemini 3 was fantastic again from
[13:17] moonshots. Just to take out a full quote
[13:20] from Dave Blondon in this. I was over at
[13:22] MIT last night talking to a bunch of
[13:23] undergrads and I'm trying to tell them
[13:25] like look you don't know this but you
[13:28] know 40 years ago we started writing
[13:29] code as a species
[13:32] before I read the rest of this I just
[13:34] want to make sure you understand he's
[13:35] saying he went to MIT 40 years ago is
[13:37] when code started in 1992
[13:41] when Netscape basically went through its
[13:43] road show and was eventually launched
[13:45] the world changed Msei world went from
[13:47] being Japan heavy to USheavy and you
[13:50] ended up having a big shift that went on
[13:52] as the world and everything about it was
[13:54] gobbled up by concentration which we now
[13:57] see with the Mag 7 that was all built on
[14:00] code
[14:02] and I swear to God if you look at what
[14:03] happens today when you write code verse
[14:05] 40 years ago it's identical it's like a
[14:07] higher level language nothing's really
[14:08] changed all of a sudden you can build
[14:10] software by talking to the machine it's
[14:11] such a different world by starting today
[14:13] and moving forward this is like a
[14:15] different world starting today from the
[14:17] day that we lived in yesterday this is
[14:18] all about how he feels having used
[14:21] Gemini 3. And the reason I'm bringing
[14:23] that up is as you get negative and
[14:25] believe there's a bubble. This bubble
[14:28] has been building now for 40 years. Code
[14:31] has dominated what has worked. You are
[14:34] fading a 40-year trend of the winners
[14:37] being built on code and you're still
[14:39] looking at a world where the
[14:41] manufacturing side and all of this other
[14:43] side has become less relevant over time.
[14:47] Nvidia's Q3 revenues came out. These are
[14:49] more facts. This is not about AI bubble.
[14:51] This is not some old guy saying that AI
[14:54] is overblown.
[14:56] Nvidia Q3 revenues surged to a record 57
[15:00] billion, up 62%. 57 billion in revenues.
[15:05] Here is the chart of their revenues.
[15:08] You're going to pick the top of that. If
[15:10] that was a falling chart, it would say
[15:12] don't catch a falling knife. This is a
[15:15] I've never seen a vertical chart like
[15:17] this go straight up. But people are
[15:19] trying to pick the top in it. Nvidia is
[15:22] cheap. I've done this before on this.
[15:24] I've done it on interviews. I'll say it
[15:26] again. There is going to be $5 trillion
[15:29] almost assuredly of buildout in data
[15:32] centers over the course of the next 5
[15:34] years around the globe. Nvidia currently
[15:37] is gets about 35 to 50% of that buildout
[15:41] number. It's can even go up to 60%.
[15:44] Unless you believe they're going to lose
[15:45] their moat, which is almost impossible
[15:47] as I've talked about, they're going to
[15:48] get some percentage. And right now, we
[15:51] have an expectation out five years of
[15:53] their revenues being about 425 billion.
[15:55] They keep beating numbers. They keep
[15:57] raising numbers. Pay attention to
[15:59] Nvidia. When it starts to reach a point
[16:02] where it is expensive and where its PE
[16:04] is not compressing and where its margins
[16:06] are actually going down as opposed to
[16:08] being out, you can start to worry about
[16:10] things. Until then, just follow the
[16:12] facts. Here are more facts. Palunteer
[16:15] which basically said in the last
[16:17] earnings as as I highlighted that they
[16:19] are now benefiting from hundreds of
[16:22] companies that are using them for their
[16:24] adoption side up 63% revenue growth.
[16:28] Forget about the valuation and the fact
[16:29] that it got too far in front of it. The
[16:32] revenue growth is a fact. AMD's revenue
[16:34] growth is a fact. Meta, the companies
[16:36] you're worried about still going 26%.
[16:39] Revenue growth should be some multiple
[16:41] of nominal GDP. These are expenditures
[16:45] numbers yearover-year.
[16:47] Every single one of them is in some way
[16:49] tied. And here's the S&P 500 revenue
[16:52] growth. Just look at these related to
[16:54] it. These are facts. This is not a joke.
[16:57] S&P 500 profit margins made all-time
[17:00] highs because of what's going on with
[17:03] Nvidia. The rest of them AI is taking
[17:06] center stage in corporate America. Every
[17:08] single part of the S&P 500 is now
[17:11] mentioning AI. You will be out of
[17:12] business if you do not incorporate AI.
[17:15] AI will force a recession without having
[17:19] a recession. A recession is about
[17:21] cleansing out the weak, letting the
[17:23] strong to survive. That's what Amazon
[17:26] did against its competition back in the
[17:28] 2009 to 2019 period. You're going to see
[17:31] the same thing from public companies
[17:33] over any companies that can't compete
[17:36] with it. It's going to continue to put
[17:38] pressure on the labor market. You're
[17:39] going to continue to have a K-shaped
[17:40] economy. There's just no way to get
[17:42] around it. And the governments will be
[17:44] forced to continue to give transfer
[17:45] payments to the Kshape without a
[17:48] recession. DRAM prices, this is a fact.
[17:51] This is from September. So, as the
[17:53] bubble fears are growing, DRAM prices.
[17:57] So, every time you hear, oh, we we've
[17:59] got accounting issues with DRAMs. The
[18:01] price of DRAM keeps going higher. Here's
[18:05] DRAM, the old DRAMs, the ones that are
[18:07] basically should not be going up this
[18:10] fast. This is this overlaid with PMIs. I
[18:13] will still say PMIs are going higher
[18:14] next year because of the infrastructure
[18:16] needs for this buildout.
[18:19] If we were in a bubble, as Michael Bur
[18:21] said, the stock market does lead, but
[18:23] what also leads is junk spreads. Here is
[18:28] the dot bubble. LTCM starts there. We've
[18:31] got credit fears that go two years
[18:33] before we get it. In the housing
[18:34] problem, we had tons of issues going on
[18:37] before the stock market peaked. peaked
[18:38] in March of '08, which is even up
[18:40] higher. So, he's right, but junk spreads
[18:43] lead the stock market. What also leads
[18:46] is bank stocks. This is year-over-year
[18:48] bank stocks. Again, at the peak in 2000,
[18:52] we've got credit problems. We've got
[18:53] lending problems. That's a bubble. And
[18:55] guess what? The banks year-over-year,
[18:57] they're down about 20%. Same number they
[18:59] were down at the peak in stocks in ' 07.
[19:04] So, these are the peaks in stocks. This
[19:06] is where bank stocks were trading
[19:07] year-over-year. Right now they're up
[19:08] 13%. I mentioned this last week. So
[19:11] again, as people just throw this stuff
[19:12] out there. It's a bubble. It's a bubble.
[19:15] Get some facts. Here's the five-year
[19:17] move in NDX leading up into the dot
[19:20] bubble. This is normalized. This is
[19:24] 800%. So it starts at 100. We're at 917.
[19:29] That's five years.
[19:31] Here's where the current level is, 95%.
[19:37] So 10 times more or eight times more,
[19:40] whatever you want to go through last
[19:42] time. So when you're looking at a
[19:43] bubble, at least do it right. Capex
[19:45] spending on AI is masking economic
[19:46] weakness. I completely agree. I'll go
[19:50] through why capex spending is right now
[19:54] in my opinion masking significant
[19:56] economic weakness. No matter what people
[19:59] say about trying to figure out the math
[20:01] as to what it's doing, if AI capex
[20:04] wasn't happening, we weren't having the
[20:05] money going through and Nvidia wasn't
[20:07] getting the revenues coming through, I
[20:09] don't believe the economy would be
[20:11] growing at the level that it is. We've
[20:12] got GDP now up near 4%. The last quarter
[20:15] was up around 3%. We wouldn't be
[20:18] anywhere near there. We'd be closer to
[20:19] 1%. We'd be struggling getting through.
[20:21] It would be very difficult. Artificial
[20:23] intelligence is consuming capital faster
[20:25] than investors can recalibrate. Bank of
[20:27] America now sees global hypers scale
[20:29] spending blah blah blah blah blah. Now
[20:30] the reason I put this up if I agree with
[20:32] it that level of investment is
[20:34] extraordinary. At its peak the 5G
[20:36] telecom buildout consumed about 70% of
[20:39] operating cash flow. AI infrastructure
[20:41] is now approaching the same strength.
[20:43] I I I just can't emphasize how easy it
[20:46] is for you guys to go into chat GPT take
[20:49] a snip snapshot of that paste it in
[20:52] there and say give me your read on this.
[20:55] That's all I did in this. Why comparing
[20:57] the AI capex to the 5G telecom buildout
[21:00] is misleading. Telecom was a levered low
[21:03] margin crappy regulatory cap industry. I
[21:06] added my own uh
[21:08] adjective in there. Hyperscalers are the
[21:10] opposite. They're high margin, low
[21:12] leverage, enormous cash flow. This looks
[21:14] much more like the 1990 semiconductor
[21:16] capex boom. Do you remember how that
[21:18] exhed? No. Cloud buildout in the early
[21:21] AWS Azure era. Do you remember that
[21:23] ended? No. Railroads are electrification
[21:27] era industrial capex booms. It's not
[21:29] like telecom. Again, I I if you guys are
[21:33] going to try to lose money and just
[21:35] follow these people that aren't doing
[21:37] anything on this and are just using
[21:38] their history of I can tell this is a
[21:41] bubble because I'm a genius as opposed
[21:42] to what are the facts behind the case.
[21:45] Why am I not going to a Michelin star
[21:47] restaurant for dinner? I'm going to sit
[21:48] at home in AI and pay attention to
[21:50] things. You cannot sit there and
[21:52] actually know how or why AI is useful
[21:55] unless you have some idea as to
[21:58] possibility of cancer cures, possibility
[22:00] of replacing people with it and using in
[22:02] businesses, what's actually happening.
[22:04] But it is disturbing the signals in the
[22:07] economy. So I understand why people
[22:09] believe a recession is happening. This
[22:11] is the leading economic indicator. There
[22:13] has never been a time since the in the
[22:15] history since it's been created. So for
[22:17] people that are in their 80s right now
[22:20] saying AI is overblown, just go back
[22:23] over time. This is a time where
[22:26] historically we've been in a recession
[22:28] when the LEI the LEI has been negative
[22:30] now since 2022. Since we raised rates,
[22:34] we raised rates so fast everyone thought
[22:36] there'd be a recession. Well,
[22:37] technically there is a recession.
[22:39] Commercial real estate's in a recession.
[22:41] Housing is technically getting close to
[22:42] a recession. We've got no job games
[22:45] being created. We are in some sort of a
[22:47] recession the way you define it in the
[22:49] past, but it's not the world we live in
[22:51] now. PMIs, again, this is a 20month
[22:56] average. The 20-month average, we can't
[22:58] get out of our own way. We've always
[23:00] been in a recession when manufacturing
[23:01] has been this weak. Always until now.
[23:04] The job situation, I showed this before,
[23:06] earnings per share, S&P earnings per
[23:09] share just continues to go higher. While
[23:12] temp jobs, they're not hiring temp
[23:14] employees. This has never happened
[23:16] before. So we are in a recession. This
[23:19] is why
[23:21] I did in this uh podcast I did with Dean
[23:25] Kernut. We both come from the derivative
[23:27] area. Most of the podcasts I do these
[23:29] day have some relationship at this point
[23:31] to crypto uh just because those are the
[23:34] ones that have been asking. But if you
[23:35] want to go hear me talk in more of a
[23:37] macro perspective and talk about things
[23:39] that are going on on the derivative
[23:40] world and the equity world, you can go
[23:41] listen to Dean. I thought he did a great
[23:43] job in terms of bringing up questions
[23:45] and going through it and I went through
[23:46] it in there. Now, for the pain for me,
[23:49] as wrong as I've been this year, I
[23:51] thought Bitcoin Bitcoin would be four
[23:53] times where it closed on this. So, this
[23:56] is maybe the most wrong I've been ever
[23:59] in terms of forecasting things. I
[24:01] thought this year we'd also see oil
[24:02] prices go higher. Uh we didn't we didn't
[24:05] see any of that. In fact, oil prices are
[24:07] not only weak, they continue to march
[24:09] down towards 50. Uh, and I believe power
[24:12] power is going higher and I think oil
[24:13] will go higher next year. But these are
[24:16] the places where I've been wrong this
[24:17] year. And Bitcoin has now fallen 36%
[24:20] from the highs that it was less than
[24:22] seven weeks ago. Now, here are the draw
[24:25] downs on this. Uh, and again, you had
[24:29] close to 90, 80, 80, 78.
[24:34] We guess could go down here. I think
[24:37] we're doing another one of these. So
[24:39] again, as long as I've been in it, I
[24:42] doubled down this week and tripled down
[24:43] this week. I also texted Anthony
[24:45] Pompiano on Tuesday and told him I
[24:47] thought the lows were in before another
[24:48] 7,000 uh point fall. So catching this
[24:51] falling knife has become something that
[24:54] has not worked for me, but
[24:57] uh I like doing things when you've got
[25:00] this much fear and greed. So maybe we'll
[25:02] go down to 70, maybe we'll go down to
[25:04] 60. I don't know. I just don't think
[25:06] we're staying down long. That's fear and
[25:08] greed index down at levels below where
[25:10] we were in liberation day. Here is the
[25:12] DSI, the daily sentiment index for the
[25:14] futures
[25:16] low since it's been uh since uh Bitcoin
[25:19] had futures.
[25:21] RSI fell below 21. Here's what's
[25:23] happened afterwards if you want to play
[25:25] the numerology game and look for an area
[25:28] to go in. But more importantly, uh I did
[25:31] write a paper called the light of the
[25:32] end of the turbulence on April 8th of
[25:35] this year. that was about the stock
[25:37] market and about the fact that again I
[25:39] thought whenever it got like this where
[25:41] people were jumping out a window and
[25:43] thinking the government was actually
[25:45] going to let the stock market fall uh it
[25:48] turned up higher because I believe risk
[25:50] assets are going higher next year
[25:51] because I believe PMIs are going higher
[25:53] next year and because I believe
[25:54] tokenization is not understood by people
[25:57] and stable coins we're going through
[25:59] some sort of a uh a liquidation part in
[26:03] crypto and it does move on its own uh
[26:05] basis is again it also rallies faster
[26:08] than anything. So in this paper I go
[26:10] through that it feels the same to me as
[26:12] it did back on April 8th where I've got
[26:14] panic coming from everywhere spread
[26:16] throughout family members, friends,
[26:18] everything along the line in terms of
[26:20] what's gone on. I get it. It's been a
[26:22] big fall. I've been wrong on it. People
[26:24] can doubt it. They can go through it.
[26:25] But at least I'm putting my bet on the
[26:28] line and highlighting why I think it is
[26:31] about to go higher. Now, in terms of
[26:33] this fall relative to the S&P,
[26:36] uh, again, it's 33%, we've had bigger
[26:39] falls to put it in perspective, and it's
[26:41] still gone higher. Most importantly to
[26:44] me, it's only down 9% year-to date, and
[26:46] that's after back-to-back years of over
[26:47] 100%. So, regardless of everything going
[26:50] on, two good weeks in Bitcoin in terms
[26:52] of a short covering rally, it could be
[26:54] outperforming the S&P. That's how fast
[26:56] it moves and how quickly when sentiment
[26:58] gets this bad historically, you can go
[27:00] the other direction. I'll take it. One
[27:02] of the other things that continues to
[27:04] make me happy is I do believe that
[27:06] retail has gotten caught here. Um, a lot
[27:10] of good things and a lot of positive
[27:11] news in Bitcoin this year. You also had
[27:13] a lot of supply from the DATs and the
[27:14] companies that were out there uh issuing
[27:17] stuff. Uh, there was a lot of supply.
[27:19] Micro Strategy obviously brought a lot
[27:20] of supply. Micro Strategy.
[27:22] This is the chart of it versus my
[27:24] specame index. Again, when you have a
[27:26] correlation that's this high that really
[27:28] begins. So this fall here to me, this
[27:31] liquidation which came right after the
[27:34] Trump tariff situation, there was a
[27:37] massive liquidation. There's still an
[27:39] overhang. This consolidation here to me
[27:41] was OG. This was my silent IPO time. And
[27:44] then this was retail getting knocked out
[27:46] once we broke the range. And I think
[27:48] this has been a lot of selling that's
[27:50] gone on. I think there's an overhang
[27:52] from that period. But we also saw the
[27:54] spec names go again. The spec names are
[27:56] mainly on nuclear, they're in quantum,
[27:57] things like that. These are names that I
[27:59] don't buy into um that I think their
[28:02] retail was just trading momentum in.
[28:04] They've bailed out of them. Here's the
[28:05] chart of it again since past the October
[28:08] 5th period. Bitcoin falls first, then
[28:11] you get a bounce and then from that
[28:12] point, the white line is spec name
[28:15] basically moving tick for tick with it
[28:17] in terms of day for day. The other thing
[28:19] it's been correlated to, there's been a
[28:20] massive growth unwind that began around
[28:23] the same time as the Bitcoin high in
[28:26] Asian growth factor. Uh, Asia is very
[28:29] much into Bitcoin and you've had a
[28:32] straight line down in the Asian growth
[28:34] factor. Massive move. Uh, there's
[28:36] clearly an unwind going on over there.
[28:38] Here is the overlay since August in the
[28:41] Asian growth factor with Bitcoin.
[28:44] Circle has done a complete round trip.
[28:46] So, you've now taken it back to the
[28:49] opening price of the IPO.
[28:53] All right. You got to love to witness.
[28:54] This is the I highlighted this before.
[28:56] S&P opened at least one and a half% only
[28:59] to close one and a half% lower. There's
[29:01] only been
[29:03] three other times in more than 32 years.
[29:06] Um,
[29:08] Liberation Day, this is when I wrote the
[29:10] light at the end of turbulence. That
[29:12] ended up being a good time to buy. Uh
[29:14] this is October and of08. Both of those
[29:18] two. Uh that was a few weeks after
[29:21] Lehman Brothers and that was when we got
[29:23] to we're getting close to an original
[29:25] low which happened a couple weeks later
[29:27] before bounce before another low that
[29:29] happened. I'm going to bring this up
[29:30] again and this time I'm going to go
[29:31] through it. Annie Duke again thinking in
[29:34] bets.
[29:36] Life is more like poker than chess. You
[29:38] must make highstake decisions with
[29:40] incomplete information, hidden
[29:41] variables, and luck by framing every
[29:43] decision as a bet. You learn to assign
[29:44] probabilities, evaluate expected values,
[29:47] and challenge your own assumptions. Duke
[29:48] emphasizes constant updating, treating
[29:50] beliefs as hypothesis that evolve as new
[29:53] evidence arrives rather than the fixed
[29:55] truths. Ultimately, the book teaches
[29:57] that great decision makers aren't
[29:58] certain. They're disciplined,
[29:59] probabilistic, and adaptable in the face
[30:01] of uncertainty. You look for the
[30:04] scenarios where things are wrong. every
[30:06] single chart. If I wanted to get worried
[30:07] about the market right now, I would want
[30:09] to see this turn negative. Again, this
[30:12] is revisions. These green lines here are
[30:14] revisions going higher. Earnings
[30:17] revisions. They still remain high. These
[30:20] are periods, and you can go through them
[30:21] on your own where you want to be long
[30:23] stocks.
[30:25] A lot of these are coming out of coming
[30:27] out of the dot bubble, coming out of the
[30:30] great financial crisis, coming out of
[30:32] COVID. We're sitting up here. This is
[30:34] why I expect the PMIs to go higher. The
[30:35] PMI went higher in here. The PMI went
[30:38] higher in here. PMIs went higher in
[30:40] here. PMIs went higher in here. You can
[30:42] go look it up for yourself. Revisions
[30:44] are going higher. And that means a lot
[30:47] of good things. Here's the revision.
[30:48] Like I said, overlaid with PMIs. I've
[30:51] shown this chart before. This is the
[30:52] 20week moving average of
[30:56] revisions. Last one was 0.16. We are
[30:59] currently on a 20week at 0.15. It is
[31:01] still sitting up here, guys. revisions
[31:03] are going higher and the positive
[31:05] earnings news in the US has not been
[31:07] lost in the rest of the world. This is a
[31:08] global story global.
[31:16] It's actually going faster outside the
[31:19] US which is going to help the US as
[31:21] well. And to go back in time, this is
[31:24] the biggest relative earnings growth
[31:27] differential from the US
[31:30] rest of the world in the last decade. So
[31:34] owning international stocks, which I
[31:37] still like over US stocks, even though
[31:39] I'm bullish on a AI guys, see I can have
[31:41] a view that is focused more on else. I
[31:44] also like small caps more. And guess
[31:45] what? And h how can you be looking at
[31:49] this? Realizing consensus EPS growth for
[31:52] select
[31:55] small caps forecast point to nearly 60%
[32:00] growth. If we get anything close to 60%
[32:02] growth, do you think small caps are not
[32:04] going to have a good year? Do you not
[32:06] think the market's going to have a good
[32:07] year? Um especially since what they're
[32:09] coming out of negative. Negative. This
[32:12] again is what PMIs look like when you go
[32:16] from negative midcap, same thing. So for
[32:19] those of you in the midcap and small cap
[32:21] space, there are good things to come.
[32:24] You've been in a bare market for three
[32:25] years. If you get PMIs moving higher or
[32:28] if it's just because rates are moving
[32:30] lower and they're getting the benefit of
[32:31] the tailwind of rates moving lower, it's
[32:33] still good. Oversold breath.
[32:37] We are oversold, but in particular the
[32:39] NASDAQ on the breath. Oversold. I also
[32:41] highlighted this. Oh, didn't make this
[32:43] bigger. We're oversold on NYC breath.
[32:47] We're oversold on S&P breath.
[32:52] We got the Fed move down to less than
[32:54] 50% earlier in the week. And then an
[32:57] important news item came out. New York
[32:59] President John Williams sees room for
[33:02] central bank to cut interest rates again
[33:04] as the labor market softens. This is a
[33:07] big deal. Um, and again, I say it's a
[33:09] big deal. jumped the probability back to
[33:12] above 60. I don't think this is
[33:14] necessary, but I say this because
[33:16] remember in the first quarter of next
[33:18] year, you're not only going to have the
[33:19] one big beautiful bill positive side.
[33:22] You not only have the monetary lag, but
[33:24] you're going to have Trump pick his Fed
[33:25] chair. These are all news items to come.
[33:27] I want you to keep your head in the
[33:29] game. AI is strong. Don't fall for the
[33:32] trap of the bubble stuff. Don't fall for
[33:34] the trap as we're going through one of
[33:36] the most potent and unbelievable times
[33:38] where margins are going higher. This is
[33:41] going to remain a story and it's going
[33:42] into a midterm year where affordability
[33:44] is a major issue. Craig Shapiro put out
[33:47] a fantastic um post. Uh and I've used it
[33:51] in meetings this week. Uh I believe in
[33:54] it. It's he put it in a way that was
[33:56] great. I just want you guys to think
[33:57] about this. If you're focused on uh
[34:00] industrials, if you're focused on old
[34:02] commodity related names, AI's demand
[34:05] colliding with physical limits, the next
[34:07] moat is control of land power, water,
[34:09] and grid access. In a world where we
[34:11] need all electricity,
[34:15] the legacy industries use up a
[34:18] tremendous amount of electricity,
[34:21] aluminum, steel, all kinds of stuff.
[34:24] They've got he's got chemicals listed
[34:26] here. if we need it, the hyperscalers
[34:30] can pay them to go offline and use their
[34:32] electricity allocations. This is a great
[34:35] great call. I liked it so much I put it
[34:38] into chat GPT. It gave me a whole bunch
[34:41] of ideas on it. Again, as I do my videos
[34:43] coming up that'll be on the payw wall,
[34:45] you guys are going to hopefully be able
[34:47] to do this yourself and all of a sudden
[34:49] it comes with names. It comes with
[34:51] places to go look. But I would keep that
[34:53] in the back of your mind because I do
[34:54] think that is what's going to happen.
[34:57] I'm going to finish it off again with
[34:59] Annie. Uh, all decisions are bets on the
[35:01] future and they aren't right or wrong
[35:03] because they turn out well or poorly.
[35:05] They're right or wrong because of how we
[35:07] made them. I couldn't agree more. I want
[35:09] you guys to remember that as you go
[35:11] through this. It is about making
[35:13] decisions right now, not based on the
[35:15] fear. It's got to be based on facts. And
[35:17] even though we don't know the future,
[35:20] all decisions are bets on the future.
[35:22] You put all the information together, my
[35:24] job here every week is to try to give
[35:26] you guys a story that involves both the
[35:30] positive and negatives that are going on
[35:32] with AI to help you guys be strong in
[35:34] these points when people down because a
[35:36] lot of the alpha that's being made is
[35:38] during these times. Even if you just
[35:40] increase your waiting at this point and
[35:42] then reduce it when it goes back higher,
[35:44] we're going to have a lot of these
[35:45] moves. And just remember, Micron was
[35:47] under a 100red for the better part of
[35:49] the year at the beginning. Couldn't get
[35:51] above and then when it finally went, it
[35:54] went up to 240 without really stopping
[35:56] at any point. I think you're going to
[35:58] get similar moves next years on some of
[36:00] these small cap names. So, do your
[36:01] homework now. Don't panic. Use this
[36:04] opportunity and just remember
[36:06] the light at the end of the turbulence
[36:09] is the time to be focused. Have a great
[36:11] Thanksgiving, guys. I appreciate
[36:12] everything there. Subscribe if you
[36:14] haven't already. Give it to your
