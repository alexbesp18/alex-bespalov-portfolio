--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] All right, we're cruising through the
[00:01] summer. Uh, you guys can read it on your
[00:04] own.
[00:09] All right, so S&P up about 1% for the
[00:13] week.
[00:16] Small caps, uh, I'm pretty much done
[00:19] showing the Russell 2000. I've moved on
[00:21] to the S&P small cap index uh just
[00:25] because I think there's some uh some bad
[00:28] some bad setup in uh in Russell in terms
[00:31] of the waitings with the unprofitable
[00:32] companies. So I'm going to focus on a
[00:34] pure small cap uh index going forward
[00:39] because I do think small caps are going
[00:41] to uh have a change and you can see
[00:44] small caps have done well during this
[00:46] period. This is on an absolute basis.
[00:48] They were up 3% last week uh relative to
[00:52] the S&P. There were a couple big days.
[00:54] We actually had the biggest day
[00:57] since November and before that it was
[00:58] the biggest day in over a year except
[01:01] for the one day at the election. So the
[01:03] question is what went on this week?
[01:04] Well, rate cuts. Uh and obviously those
[01:08] two days there and I tweeted about this
[01:10] or posted on X a very large two-day
[01:12] move. uh given up once the PPI came out
[01:15] to some degree, but for the week, it
[01:18] still was, like I said, a a good
[01:19] performance, and you're talking about
[01:21] the biggest performance for small caps
[01:22] relative to the S&P uh except for the
[01:27] massive move on uh in April. So, this
[01:31] one was absolutely due to the belief
[01:33] that rates are going to be cut. There's
[01:35] a lot of other things that are going on,
[01:36] too. I'm going to kind of take you
[01:37] through some stuff. Uh it'll probably be
[01:39] more in the coming weeks, but I do think
[01:41] small caps need to be looked at here for
[01:44] a variety of reasons and one of them is
[01:46] this and this was the other thing I
[01:47] posted in X uh the pure factor
[01:51] movements. So this is over the last
[01:53] year. This is a strength monitor of
[01:55] factors with inside Bloomberg. Uh good
[01:57] thing to keep on your on your radar
[02:00] particularly when there's a regime shift
[02:02] that I think is happening. Uh I think
[02:03] there's monetary policy shifts, fiscal
[02:05] policy shifts. I'm going to go through
[02:07] them. I think there's going to be the
[02:09] potential for court ruling on the tariff
[02:12] side which I think would be a positive
[02:13] for small caps. There's a whole bunch of
[02:16] things going on as well as the next
[02:18] stage of AI which I'm going to cover not
[02:20] only in this video but in papers coming
[02:22] forward. Uh but all in all, I think this
[02:25] is going to be looked at historically as
[02:26] a major shifting points as stage one of
[02:29] AI, which is really the infrastructure
[02:31] and and efficiency gains for the MAG 7
[02:34] spreads out across industries in the
[02:36] adoption phase, which will be much more
[02:39] positive with a tide that lifts all
[02:41] boats. Uh but the main thing is here,
[02:43] look at the sharp ratio over the last
[02:44] year, three and a half for size. Uh it's
[02:47] obviously crowded. Momentum, same thing.
[02:49] Whenever you get like this, you have to
[02:51] be looking. High sharp ratios are
[02:53] something I always would monitor to look
[02:54] for the chance that hedge funds would be
[02:56] in a draw down. Uh momentum had its
[02:59] worst
[03:01] week
[03:02] since March. So, we are seeing and we've
[03:06] been seeing I showed you a couple weeks
[03:07] ago some quant moves. Uh I would just
[03:10] keep it in check. Aside from that,
[03:12] corporate bond spreads sink to 27-year
[03:14] low. We've got the move index. So, the
[03:17] Bonval index finally starts to break
[03:19] down uh to the lowest level since 22.
[03:23] So, basically, we're finally going down.
[03:25] You've got the DAX at all-time highs.
[03:27] You've got the Italian Footsie MIB at
[03:29] all-time highs. You've got the Footsie
[03:31] in the UK at all-time highs. The Dey at
[03:33] all-time highs. Cosby's getting close.
[03:37] The Shanghai Composits near five-year
[03:39] highs. Yeah, this is despite the
[03:41] perception that China has no uh no
[03:44] strength in its economy. Here we go.
[03:47] Remember this one here? Stimulus comes
[03:49] through, it consolidates. This certainly
[03:51] looks like it could be the beginning of
[03:53] some kind of a third wave in here or
[03:54] it's in the midst of it. Look at this
[03:56] sharp ratio. This is many, many days in
[03:58] a row. China not getting the do that it
[04:00] deserves. And of course, we have the
[04:02] banks. The BKX is sitting near the
[04:04] all-time highs uh about to break out.
[04:10] The European banks have been hot all
[04:12] year, but they're just continuing to
[04:13] rage. The Asian bank index again, look
[04:17] at this chart. Breaks out, kind of
[04:20] consolidates, comes down, retest once,
[04:22] and now going higher. Reflationary boom
[04:25] is the story. Um, and with reflationary
[04:28] booms, you look for overlaps with the
[04:29] Asian banks, and you do it versus the
[04:32] PMI. I'm going to keep harping on the
[04:34] fact that for those of you listening,
[04:36] pushing back consistently on everything
[04:38] you can, remaining bearish, PMIs are
[04:41] going higher. They are going higher. Uh
[04:44] Q2 earning season has been so strong
[04:46] that Wall Street analysts are raising
[04:47] their 2025 S&P earnings estimates. The
[04:49] opposite was true before the last three
[04:50] earning seasons. Uh six of 11 sectors.
[04:54] It's not just tech. Tide is lifting all
[04:57] boats. Is the stock market in a bubble?
[04:59] This is just to show that sentiment
[05:01] remains fixated on things that don't
[05:04] make sense. Jason Shapiro,
[05:06] why? It's the best thing to put. 20 30%
[05:09] bulls, 46% bears this week on the AI.
[05:13] And if you want to fight it, here's the
[05:15] uish. This is going back to 1978.
[05:19] This is where we are right now. Um,
[05:21] people are not bullish. That is for sure
[05:23] when you've gotish down there. And
[05:24] here's the AI. Again, we just came in at
[05:27] minus6 as I showed you. This is a
[05:30] one-year average. So, this is the 52
[05:32] weeks. I mean, this is not a bubble.
[05:36] This is not anything that anyone is is
[05:38] grabbing on to except for retail and
[05:42] quants. Uh computers don't have the same
[05:45] bias that people do. And as I go through
[05:47] this, I'll be calling it quote unquote
[05:48] the academic side that people are using.
[05:50] Oh, things are overvalued. Oh, we have
[05:52] this. It's just continuous. It won't
[05:55] stop. Uh Tony P at Goldman Sachs, I
[05:58] thought this was a good uh thing. Folks
[06:00] have legitimate fundamental concerns, so
[06:01] the professionals aren't fully risked
[06:03] up. In the end, however, the broader
[06:04] flow of capital, which includes CTAs,
[06:08] systematic quant strategies, retail
[06:11] buybacks coupled with double-digit
[06:13] earnings growth, doubledigit earnings
[06:15] growth when everyone was expecting
[06:17] everything to collapse and they had a 3%
[06:19] earnings growth and we came in at 12,
[06:21] has powered the market higher.
[06:23] professional investors are fairly sober
[06:25] and have kept the risk on leash. I said
[06:27] it last week, I'm going to keep saying
[06:28] it. This is a very good broad equity
[06:30] syndicate uh indicator using the
[06:32] positioning across a bunch of things at
[06:34] Goldman Sachs. It's not bearish. It's
[06:36] just not where you'd think it would be
[06:38] like it was here at the end of 24 going
[06:40] into 25 when we had the big fall. So,
[06:43] we're just don't have the sentiment
[06:45] sitting up there at what you'd expect.
[06:46] Now, we did have inflation data this
[06:49] week. CPI comes out and Bessant comes
[06:52] out immediately and talks about it.
[06:54] There were obviously some parts in it
[06:56] that were a little higher than expected,
[06:58] but again when everyone was expecting
[07:00] the tariffs, the latest inflation report
[07:02] continues to no negative impacts from
[07:04] tariffs. Core goods prices were up 2.
[07:06] They're up just 1.1 over the past 12
[07:08] months. It's very hard to argue that the
[07:10] inflation situation is out of control.
[07:12] There is an uptick, but again, it's
[07:13] coming from levels. So, this is the core
[07:15] CPI here. little uptick here and then
[07:18] the 12 month sticky X shelter has come
[07:21] back up, but they're both in line.
[07:23] They're higher than they were before.
[07:24] That's going to become a story for me as
[07:26] we go, but it's not like we've got some
[07:28] raging out of inflation situation. Um,
[07:31] and then here's another way to look at
[07:32] this is the annualized the fivemonth
[07:35] average of the threemonth uh versus the
[07:38] core CPI. Let's leave that one alone.
[07:40] Now, the PPI PPI comes out 0.9 highest
[07:44] in three years. So this freaks people
[07:46] out. Here's the look of it. We're back
[07:48] into the point of COVID. So there's no
[07:50] doubt that the tariffs have had an
[07:51] impact if you don't believe it. Here's
[07:53] the just the finished goods. So the
[07:55] finished goods of PPI up here and you've
[07:58] got the trend going similar to back
[07:59] then. So that has taken everyone and got
[08:02] them worried. Other economic data for
[08:03] the week that was on the stronger side.
[08:06] Uh here's the PMI, the white line. This
[08:10] is now we had the Empire number. This is
[08:13] a composite that I've kept over the
[08:15] years of the Empire, the Philly, so the
[08:17] Northeast plus Dallas. Uh, it's up here.
[08:21] So, it did have a bump uh back here. We
[08:24] followed. I still will contend that now
[08:26] that we've gotten through things, you're
[08:28] going to see PMIs go higher because of
[08:30] the one big beautiful bill being done
[08:33] and at the same time the tariffs being
[08:35] done and at the same time the AI action
[08:38] plan and at the same same time all of
[08:41] the deregulation stuff that is going on.
[08:43] I'll highlight some of that going
[08:44] forward. Um the small business survey
[08:46] came out. Optimism rises again while
[08:48] uncertainty remains high. Uh and it got
[08:51] to the highest level since February. So,
[08:53] small business does overlay with PMIs.
[08:56] Uh, in terms of the job situation, just
[08:58] like I said last week, uh, I showed the
[09:00] employment tax receipts for the first
[09:02] week. Here they are again. They're up at
[09:04] 7.8%
[09:05] which basically means all of the
[09:07] weakness we saw in receipts. And again,
[09:09] employment receipts are actual dollars
[09:11] that get paid. Um, so it does show this
[09:15] is not a hiring thing. So, this is not
[09:16] about people being hired. This is about
[09:19] dollars being paid. It gets back into
[09:21] why I said the aggregate payroll is a
[09:22] better measure to look at. We have a
[09:24] hiring problem in this country. It is
[09:26] only going to get worse because of AI.
[09:29] Um the big move for the week and the
[09:31] thing that made stocks gy rate that had
[09:32] an impact obviously on uh the
[09:37] uh the factors. So here is the move
[09:41] first from the CPI. This is the
[09:43] probability of the Fed going 25. So we
[09:46] got over 100% meaning we were leaking at
[09:49] one point. So this is the inverted uh
[09:52] meaning we were actually talking 50 and
[09:54] you heard a few people talk 50. Bessant
[09:56] was one of them. Then we got the PPI, we
[09:58] reverse and went the other direction. So
[10:00] the market is telling you that it's at
[10:02] an inflection point right now with the
[10:03] Fed. One thing is clear from the Fed,
[10:05] there's zero consensus about the Fed
[10:07] going forward. That's all well and good.
[10:09] Besson came out urges Fed to lower 50
[10:12] lower rates by 150 base points or more.
[10:15] Uh Besson stated that if you look at any
[10:17] model, it suggests we should probably be
[10:19] 150 to 175 basis points lowering the Fed
[10:22] implying the Fed funds rate ought to be
[10:24] around 2.6%.
[10:26] Um over the last 33 years, this is from
[10:28] Jim Biano. The Fed only cut rates once
[10:30] over 33 years when core CPI was above 3%
[10:34] which was last year. 10ear yield shot up
[10:36] from 36 September to 485 January. I
[10:39] talked about this last week. Um, I think
[10:41] this it this part here is what every
[10:43] single macro person believes that if the
[10:45] Fed were to cut rates, this would go
[10:47] higher. It's a very different place than
[10:49] last year. The SOM rule was the only
[10:51] weakness in the jobs market back then.
[10:53] We are actually down to sub 100,000 jobs
[10:56] uh over the course of the last three
[10:58] months. We have a hiring problem in this
[11:00] country due to AI. It is only going to
[11:02] continue in my mind. Uh meaning we're
[11:04] going to be at the lower end. But also,
[11:06] they surprised last year. Don't forget
[11:08] that they weren't supposed to do 50 in
[11:10] September. It was a 50/50 shot. They did
[11:13] do 50. The market responded, but also
[11:16] Biden was the president. Trump is the
[11:19] president now. He has said he wants
[11:20] rates lower. He has been arguing he
[11:22] wants rates lower. And as this thing
[11:26] shows, he's basically got a noose around
[11:29] Pal at this point. Pal can do what he
[11:30] wants. But you're getting more and more
[11:33] Fed people that are basically showing
[11:36] that there is a argument to be made
[11:39] right now when it comes to inflation
[11:42] which over the last six releases has
[11:45] surprised on the downside five times.
[11:47] Yes, one of them went higher which was
[11:50] expected on the PPI. The CPI was in
[11:52] line. It's very hard to make the
[11:54] argument when the payroll numbers have
[11:55] gone down. You've seen some of the Fed
[11:57] governors say I do agree that that's
[11:59] happened. Um, so I wanted to bring this
[12:01] up because there's too many people
[12:03] having an opinion about
[12:05] what they think the Fed should do. And I
[12:08] was at a dinner back in 2023, right
[12:10] after Silicon Valley Bank. And remember,
[12:12] after Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed kept
[12:15] hiking. Um, and I was at a dinner with
[12:18] David Zervos who basically said he would
[12:20] just call people out. That's a normative
[12:22] statement. You're not giving me any
[12:23] facts. You're just telling me what they
[12:25] should do based on the interpretation of
[12:26] economic conditions.
[12:28] and what ought to do as opposed to what
[12:30] they said they were going to do. So we
[12:32] have it built in right now. Pal can
[12:34] reverse that this week at Jackson Hole.
[12:37] But just remember the pressure is not
[12:39] only coming right now. Now the market is
[12:42] starting to realize that every release
[12:45] that goes there's more and more evidence
[12:47] that the administration is willing to
[12:49] tolerate a higher inflation rate. So I'm
[12:53] talked about it this week with many many
[12:55] people. I believe you have to start
[12:57] believing there's an unofficial
[12:59] unannounced higher inflation target and
[13:02] I'll go through the reason why but in
[13:04] this case with Bess the reason that JP
[13:06] pal gets nicknamed too late is because
[13:07] he wants to go into a series of rate
[13:09] hikes he's not willing he's not Allen
[13:11] Greenspan who is very forward thinking
[13:13] critical here forward thinking they try
[13:16] to be more data driven backward thinking
[13:20] which I think is a mistake because I
[13:21] think we're going back into economy like
[13:22] we had in the '9s in the 1990s We grew
[13:26] about 4%. The internet had just come
[13:29] out. This is his AI argument. This is
[13:30] what he said very recently after the
[13:32] announcement of the AI action plan on
[13:34] the All-In podcast. The capital
[13:36] expenditur boom will transition into a
[13:38] productivity boom from around 2026.
[13:41] Similar to past technology waves, you
[13:43] have to understand the White House is in
[13:45] bed. Literally, David Saxs almost lives
[13:48] in the White House with the AI people,
[13:50] with the crypto people. You cannot sit
[13:52] there and believe that the Fed is going
[13:54] to remain in this worried about an
[13:55] inflation scenario. JP pal may or drone
[13:58] pal may, but this is not going to be a
[14:00] scenario that the White House is going
[14:01] to turn. So they're telling you that
[14:03] during this administration, they're
[14:05] going to put someone in charge who's
[14:06] going to be focused more forward
[14:08] thinking. This is a change in monetary
[14:10] policy. This is a change in terms of
[14:12] viewing things. Most macro people are
[14:13] still fixated in the same way. And I
[14:15] hear this push back on the PMIs, on the
[14:17] leis, on everything. This is about AI.
[14:20] this is about productivity. He believes
[14:23] AI could recreate that environment of
[14:24] high growth without inflation. Whether
[14:26] or not it's true, that's the bet that
[14:29] they're saying they're going to make.
[14:32] And they don't really have a choice
[14:33] because of the fiscal dominance side.
[14:34] And I'm going to go through other
[14:35] reasons why AI initiatives are running
[14:38] through the entire system and
[14:39] contributing to keep inflation
[14:40] expectations under control. People see
[14:43] technological advances, AI included, is
[14:45] part of a supply side narrative that
[14:47] increases efficiency and capacity to
[14:49] help offset inflationary pressures. The
[14:51] deregulation in the AI is what they're
[14:53] focused on. You have to adapt to a new
[14:55] monetary policy going forward. If you
[14:58] don't, you're going to get caught. The
[15:00] second that they cut rates, I think this
[15:02] is going to be a trigger point for
[15:03] people to change their views. Just
[15:05] remember, this is about artificial
[15:07] intelligence is why do these videos? Uh,
[15:09] I put this in there. This is not a quote
[15:11] in this. I asked Chachi BT to come up
[15:13] with a quote. When exponential invasion
[15:15] is moving this fast, today is already
[15:16] yesterday. By the time you cap catch up,
[15:18] the future has passed you twice. Besson
[15:20] has criticized the Federal Reserve for
[15:22] being too academic, overly focused on
[15:24] backward-looking models and historical
[15:26] relationships instead of anticipating
[15:28] where the economy is headed. I 100%
[15:31] agree that forecasting on stupid things
[15:35] like SOM rules like the Taylor rule all
[15:37] of that garbage when we are standing in
[15:40] front of humanoids and full self
[15:43] autonomous driving and AI and people not
[15:45] being hired by companies that are
[15:47] growing rapidly where the uh S&P is
[15:50] being dominated by seven companies. We
[15:52] are in a completely different world and
[15:54] the focus on old tools is ridiculous.
[15:56] He's not alone in those. He These are
[15:58] all people that have been mentioned or
[16:00] still in possibility for the Fed chair
[16:03] role. You've got Rick Reer, David
[16:05] Malpass, don't laugh. Um David Zervos,
[16:09] I'll get to him later. Um if you go
[16:11] through all of the commentary that they
[16:13] said, it basically be summarized with
[16:15] this one. By the way, Mel Madison, very
[16:17] very good. Listen to podcast he's on. Uh
[16:20] follow him on X. I think he's got a a
[16:22] clear head when it comes to the MMT
[16:24] narrative. Uh I agree with what he's
[16:26] talking about, but most importantly,
[16:27] he's one of the few people out there
[16:29] basically just saying this is what the
[16:30] government has to do. They don't have
[16:32] any choice, which is part of the Bitcoin
[16:34] world. Uh he's not a Bitcoin person, per
[16:37] se, but I think he's done a very good
[16:39] job this year, and he's had great calls
[16:40] on the market. Um Fed is getting a
[16:43] makeover.
[16:45] It's what David Malpass talked about.
[16:46] Here are the details. Next Fed chair
[16:48] should challenge entrenched PhD
[16:50] economist thinking at the Fed. You know
[16:51] my thoughts on that. He wants the Fed to
[16:53] get out of the way, let the markets go,
[16:56] supports foundational changes including
[16:58] improving access to loans for small
[16:59] businesses,
[17:01] advocates using forward-looking. He
[17:03] basically came out and went through the
[17:05] whole entire thing
[17:09] that Besson did. They're all rolling
[17:11] this out. What so many people are
[17:13] missing again, Mel Madison, is that they
[17:15] are desperately want to make the case
[17:17] against cut is that a new regime is
[17:19] being put in place at the Fed. one that
[17:21] wants deep down in places they don't
[17:22] talk about parties higher inflation
[17:24] mirren's appointment just the start of
[17:26] it completely agree you have to take
[17:28] these signals as what is going to happen
[17:31] because we invest in the market the
[17:33] stock market moves based not on what the
[17:34] Fed is going to do in September there'll
[17:36] be you know a movement because people
[17:39] are bearish and they want to sell things
[17:41] so if the Fed doesn't cut in September
[17:42] it's going to be a disappointment
[17:44] obviously uh but at the same time if
[17:46] earnings are going to be good the next
[17:48] quarter then the stock market's going to
[17:49] go back up and the Fed will eventually
[17:51] cut into that. If the Fed does cut and
[17:53] the PMIs are above 50, watch out at that
[17:55] point because then you're talking about
[17:56] a reflationary boom and they're sending
[17:58] that signal. But I wanted to bring up
[18:00] the Scott Mirren piece here based on all
[18:01] the commentary from the potential new
[18:03] Fed chairman in the paper by Steven
[18:04] Myron. Do you think the Federal will be
[18:05] focused soon on a forward-looking
[18:07] approach? I just added DPT to go through
[18:09] it. It laid it out here. You can read it
[18:11] on your own, but the answer is yes.
[18:15] This is who I want to be the Fed chair.
[18:17] How can David Zervos not be the Fed
[18:19] chair? the world will be a much better
[18:20] place with that. Um, Goldman Sachs is
[18:23] saying St. Pel will be hawkish again.
[18:24] This is the only thing I put this in
[18:25] there because this is what people care
[18:26] about. They're trading off that. Uh, AI
[18:29] impact of AI adoption over time. So, I
[18:31] went through asked chat GPT to do this
[18:33] work for me and basically took it
[18:35] through what is going with with AI and
[18:38] what should we expect. The reason I
[18:40] wanted to do this, I want to see what it
[18:41] said about all of these. This is the big
[18:44] one. So, we're right now in finishing up
[18:49] wave one. We're about to go into wave
[18:51] two. This is the biggest part of where
[18:54] the profit growth should be. And that's
[18:55] because the digital employees will be
[18:58] higher. That's why you see the
[18:59] unemployment rate also go higher during
[19:02] this stage. GDP will grow on this thing.
[19:06] Inflation should come down over this
[19:08] period. This is a two to fiveyear
[19:09] period. This is into AGI. This is the
[19:11] most important part of the AI adoption.
[19:14] You have to think about that as you're
[19:16] making decisions. Targeted efficiency
[19:18] gains without large layoffs. So wave
[19:21] first wave one is the one we're
[19:22] finishing. This is the one where you get
[19:24] a corporate profit proofs. We saw that
[19:26] you're kind of getting quiet labor
[19:27] displacement targeted efficiency gains.
[19:30] This is mainly been by the companies
[19:31] that already had the ability of doing it
[19:32] in particular the mag 7. The second wave
[19:34] though broad process automation. So it's
[19:37] going across the entire
[19:40] uh workflows. mid-skill worker pressure,
[19:43] widening gap. More disposable income may
[19:46] acrue to the shareholders of companies
[19:48] and to high-skilled, high-paid workers,
[19:50] not to displace workers. It's going to
[19:52] lower aggregate demand unless policy
[19:53] offsets it. This is where you will be
[19:56] fighting Trump because his job is to
[19:59] find a way to keep the thing balanced.
[20:01] This is not a balanced thing. I just
[20:02] want to make sure you see this is where
[20:04] we are right now. We've got the MAG7
[20:06] earnings growth year-over-year 26%.
[20:08] We've got the S&P non-mag7 at 4%. This
[20:12] is where we are. Trump wants to change
[20:14] this. Uh I wouldn't fight him on it. And
[20:17] we're going to finish this season
[20:18] somewhere north of here. Here's the
[20:21] market cap waiting. It's now somewhere
[20:22] up here or a little bit up here, maybe
[20:24] 35%.
[20:26] And then this is the percentage of the
[20:28] earnings growth. It's above 70 now when
[20:32] you count Nvidia coming up. This was
[20:35] something that was tweeted out. And
[20:36] again, I think this is people looking at
[20:38] things the wrong way, showing the
[20:39] concentration and thinking it's not
[20:41] justified because they're saying it's
[20:42] 30% of the earnings. That's not the way
[20:44] stocks are valued. This is on the
[20:46] earnings growth. If the growth comes
[20:48] down on the MAG7, the stocks will come
[20:50] down and that's what I think will happen
[20:53] at some point here. But the
[20:54] administration has made it fairly easily
[20:56] for them for them to do this. The third
[20:58] wave, just so you know, which is coming
[21:00] at the end of this decade, at the end of
[21:02] this decade, and is really important
[21:04] because I think it's going to start
[21:06] being built into the market late next
[21:07] year. Yes, it's going to start being
[21:09] built in, which means the stock market
[21:10] in multiples should even go higher. This
[21:12] is the AI embodiment, labor market
[21:14] restructuring. So, we're dealing with
[21:16] the cognitive labor force now, but in
[21:18] this next wave, it's really bad in terms
[21:21] of figuring out governments may respond
[21:22] with universal basic income. They've
[21:24] already kind of done it with transfer
[21:26] payments. uh we're just the next five
[21:29] years to me is going to be a very
[21:31] difficult time for the societal impact.
[21:33] Uh even if GDP grows and it's not
[21:35] distributed well, they're going to have
[21:36] to find ways to bring affordability and
[21:38] I'm going to get into all of this as we
[21:39] keep going. Um did Besson say anything
[21:42] on the All-In podcast as he was talking
[21:44] about how this great productivity boom
[21:46] is going to go? Did he talk about AI
[21:47] causing job disruption? His focus was
[21:50] almost entirely on AI's e economic
[21:52] upside. anything about job creation was
[21:55] about was about job creation. This is
[21:57] the part that is the issue. Um there's
[22:00] no way to refute this. So this is uh
[22:02] Parker Ross again I highlighted in them
[22:05] office using job growth. So this is the
[22:08] finance side the information the office
[22:10] side there's it's it's nothing. It's and
[22:12] it's been nothing now for three years.
[22:16] Uh it's happening already. Everyone's
[22:18] going to leap to go short bonds and
[22:20] short 30 years. I I think it's a very
[22:22] dangerous thing to do because of this.
[22:24] Um I don't know what Donald Trump is
[22:26] going to do, but I do know he is going
[22:28] to help the affordability thing. So this
[22:31] is the affordability gap in housing. It
[22:33] is a massive problem. It is one of the
[22:34] largest problems. It is being caused by
[22:36] the technology boom and it is going to
[22:38] be exacerbated by AI unless they can
[22:41] find a way to change this, which I think
[22:43] they will. I've talked about on prior
[22:44] podcast. And the reason why the pressure
[22:45] is going to be there, affordability
[22:48] could be key message for the midterms.
[22:50] So, as this is going on, I don't think
[22:53] playing for bond yields to go higher is
[22:55] as good as playing Bitcoin, gold, or
[22:57] stocks. So, that's my take on that. And
[22:59] I also think commodities are even, you
[23:01] know, are going to do better as a whole.
[23:03] Um, something to to really pay attention
[23:06] to, unless I'm missing something here, I
[23:07] don't know why this isn't a bigger
[23:09] story. Uh, maybe they actually think
[23:11] Donald Trump
[23:13] can't he's teflon and he can't be uh
[23:17] can't lose anything. But this seems
[23:19] pretty straightforward. DOJ seems
[23:21] awfully nervous about the tariff loss
[23:23] lawsuits. Uh warns of Trump warns of a
[23:27] great depression if the appeals courts
[23:29] tariff power. This really seems like uh
[23:32] it's going to go against legal experts
[23:33] see a real chance that Trump could lose
[23:35] the major tariff case currently making
[23:36] its way through the courts. The outcome
[23:38] remains highly s uncertain and may
[23:40] ultimately be decided by the Supreme
[23:41] Supreme Court. But Paul Ryan,
[23:45] Supreme Court likely to restrict
[23:46] tariffs, emergency tariff authority, and
[23:48] that is exactly what I'm hearing from
[23:50] people in there. If that happens, which
[23:52] could go on, um it's going to create
[23:55] uncertainty and it's going to take the
[23:56] tariffs off. I I don't know the impact
[23:59] it'll have. It should be better for
[24:01] small caps since they've been hurt um
[24:03] dramatically and obviously a lot of the
[24:05] companies on the value side or the the
[24:07] the the manufacturing side, but we'll
[24:10] see what happens. Uh, I just think it's
[24:12] something to keep on your mind as we're
[24:13] getting closer to it. Michael Hartnett
[24:16] put a special piece out on gold
[24:18] revaluation.
[24:19] Definitely worth getting in your head.
[24:21] It was obviously mentioned in kind of
[24:24] passing this year by both Trump and
[24:25] Besson and then walked back. As we've
[24:28] seen with walking stuff forward and
[24:29] walking it back, they're kind of testing
[24:31] the market uh to see what the reaction
[24:33] will be. Uh, if they lose the court
[24:36] case, they've got to do something to
[24:38] increase the Treasury's balance sheet.
[24:40] So maybe this becomes the other option
[24:42] and figuring out some way to get it
[24:44] done. Uh all I know is that Hartnett
[24:47] wrote something about it. All of these
[24:49] things are in there. Such a move would
[24:51] directly improve sovereign balance
[24:52] sheets by reducing domestic debt
[24:54] burdens.
[24:57] It would be a tacit acknowledgement of
[24:58] subordination of monetary policy to
[25:00] fiscal dominance. Um we're already in
[25:02] that stage. I just think it's important
[25:04] for people to think about because it has
[25:06] been talked about. I've listened to a
[25:08] lot of podcasts and I've heard a lot of
[25:09] smart people on it. Uh if it happens,
[25:12] everything else is very gold and crypto
[25:14] bullish, structural inflation and dollar
[25:16] debasement, revaluation, all of these
[25:19] things. Yes. Uh
[25:22] August 1st, the Fed puts out a paper on
[25:28] revaluing gold reserves.
[25:31] So
[25:33] paper came out on it. Uh again, the
[25:35] Fed's not the one that would do it.
[25:36] could be from the Treasury, but they're
[25:38] clearly writing about it for a reason.
[25:40] Uh Luke Groman has has been ahead on
[25:44] this all year in terms of the reasons
[25:46] why he's even connected it to China. And
[25:49] since we still have this trade situation
[25:51] with China, think about the Mara Lago
[25:53] accord. You can't get everybody into a
[25:55] room and get them to agree there is no
[25:57] other currency. We're not going back to
[25:58] gold. So, how do we do this? And one of
[26:01] the things that he brings up is you
[26:03] revalue gold higher. Uh,
[26:06] this podcast was back from I think
[26:08] February, but that's a good one if you
[26:10] want to go listen to a lot on it. Here
[26:12] are the highlights for if you don't want
[26:13] to listen to it in terms of what's going
[26:15] on. The solution could be settling net
[26:18] trade imbalances in gold rather than uh
[26:21] another nation's currency. Regardless of
[26:23] how it would be, you're talking about
[26:26] gold going much much higher and then
[26:28] you're repricing weakens the dollar
[26:30] versus the yuan, but in a m mutually
[26:33] agreed manner. Then he's got the
[26:35] conspiracy side uh
[26:38] speculation to a chain of recent events.
[26:40] JD Vance meeting with the Pope just
[26:42] before he dies. The Vatican is
[26:43] historically a major gold custodian.
[26:45] Trump's tweet the same evening. He who
[26:47] holds the gold makes the rules. China
[26:48] announcement days later to speed up yan
[26:50] convertability for gold and expand
[26:52] Shanghai gold. Reports of Chinese
[26:53] officials quietly meeting in US. Again,
[26:56] I don't get into that stuff, but uh as
[26:59] Hartinet said, if this goes on, sell the
[27:02] dollar, buy gold and crypto and EM. I
[27:04] think that's the trade anyway for a
[27:05] different reason on my side. But I do
[27:07] believe that AI makes this more likely
[27:09] because it continues to pressure things
[27:11] uh from the government because I don't
[27:13] think we get the GDP side. But more
[27:15] importantly, I don't know where we get
[27:17] the tax receipts from on this without
[27:19] getting the GDP much higher. So here's
[27:21] what basically goes through. This is the
[27:23] reason why you should at least be
[27:24] focused on a reflationary boom. 88
[27:27] central bank cuts year to date. Fastest
[27:28] cut cycle since 20.
[27:31] New debates on Fed independence, higher
[27:33] inflation target, sectoral price
[27:36] controls, gold revaluation, yield curve
[27:38] control. Again, I don't know how the Fed
[27:41] I don't know how Trump is going to let
[27:42] yields go higher. So again,
[27:45] you got the issue here. You get it. Best
[27:48] podcast of the week, the one you guys
[27:50] should watch. Again, not surprisingly,
[27:52] moonshots, but the reason is pretty
[27:54] clear for me. The AI crypto collision
[27:56] that will redefine global power.
[27:58] Fantastic podcast. Uh, for anyone who's
[28:02] not yet up to speed on how AI and crypto
[28:05] are linked together, uh, I've talked
[28:07] about this repeatedly.
[28:09] When we give our AI agents access to
[28:11] tokenized assets, we're going to see an
[28:13] explosion in the economy. The future of
[28:15] the web will be built for AI agents, not
[28:17] humans. Humans make biased, stupid
[28:21] decisions. AI agents will make the
[28:23] smartest decision. Watch the waitings in
[28:25] portfolio management go dramatically
[28:28] higher towards crypto when AI agents are
[28:30] in charge since it's had the best sharp
[28:31] ratio. Go buy your Bitcoin now. The
[28:34] value of human cognitive ability is
[28:36] going to go negative. It'll have to be
[28:38] illegal for humans to get in the way of
[28:40] things uh like driving or diagnosing
[28:42] diseases. U AI is electron limited.
[28:47] Yeah, we got through that. Um, all
[28:49] right. This is something I want to make
[28:50] sure if you guys don't listen to it or
[28:52] if you only listen to one part, you
[28:54] should listen to full self-driving. Um,
[28:56] I'm not going to read all of these
[28:57] things. It is critical that people
[28:59] understand the importance of full
[29:01] self-driving in robo taxis. I know
[29:03] people have heard about Whimo. I know
[29:05] that they've heard about this. You have
[29:06] to pay attention to what Elon Musk is
[29:08] doing. Why he just secured all of
[29:12] Samsung's chips. Millions of autonomous
[29:15] Teslas, millions, are expected to be
[29:18] operating without human oversight by
[29:20] late 2026. That is next year. This
[29:24] enables robo taxi fleets, dramatically
[29:26] lowering transportation costs. It
[29:28] obviously hurts driving, but this is a
[29:31] major thing. They tied it to city
[29:32] coverage, dozens of cities by the end of
[29:34] this year, covering 50% of the US
[29:36] population.
[29:38] Elon teased a major FSD update with 10
[29:41] times improvements and better video
[29:42] compression aimed for public release at
[29:44] the end of next month. Full self-driving
[29:47] has many many positive or many many
[29:49] things associated with it that have are
[29:51] going to have factor impacts in the the
[29:53] things that work. Societal shift humans
[29:56] again this is a major job thing uh in
[29:59] terms of that but this is important for
[30:02] opening up self-driving leads to robots
[30:05] to clean your house to a robot dense.
[30:07] It's the same underlying neural net
[30:09] capability. Tesla's 16.5 billion plus
[30:11] chip deal with Samsung was linked
[30:13] directly to scaling FSD means it's on
[30:16] the horizon. It means he believes this
[30:17] is going to take off dramatically. FSD
[30:20] is the first mass market AI application
[30:22] that will operate in the physical world.
[30:23] So this is a robot. This is a robot that
[30:27] learns as it goes. This is why it is
[30:30] critical. We didn't have this technology
[30:32] at any point. This is not the same as
[30:34] the whimo and the stuff that you've seen
[30:36] around uh the country which was
[30:38] sensorbased. This is literally about
[30:40] looking at things and making decisions
[30:42] and learning from the mistakes as you go
[30:44] along on everything which is critical
[30:47] for there to be robotics. Here's a way
[30:49] to think about it in another way. When
[30:51] robo taxis roll out in large numbers,
[30:53] will they benefit from this
[30:54] companionship? Um this was
[31:00] sorry I I have one out of order. So in
[31:03] LAN lattis semiconductor reported this
[31:06] week and they talked about the
[31:07] deployment of of companionships in
[31:09] advanced systems automotive. This is
[31:13] important. So that's what they said on
[31:14] there. The stock was up this week. I'll
[31:16] show you uh robo tax or I asked that
[31:19] question now. When robo taxis roll out
[31:20] large numbers will they benefit from
[31:22] this companionship? Robo taxi
[31:23] self-driving fully autonomous vehicles
[31:25] deployed at scale are likely to directly
[31:27] benefit from the compandent model and we
[31:29] you can go read these things in here as
[31:31] you go through it. The main reason why
[31:33] I'm bringing this up is we have been in
[31:35] a bare market in autos now and housing
[31:38] for some time. You can see what has
[31:40] happened uh in lattis semiconductor
[31:43] which is a semiconductor which has not
[31:45] benefited with the other semis. The
[31:46] other semis like the SMH are up here.
[31:49] I've highlighted this before to certain
[31:51] PMS as a stock especially down in this
[31:53] area as one that would benefit once we
[31:56] expanded and got into the next phase of
[32:00] AI which would be when intelligence
[32:02] actually reached a level which is during
[32:04] phase two which would lead to the
[32:05] embodiment stuff. Robo taxis is the
[32:08] beginning of the embodiment phase. Lat
[32:10] semiconductors are still sitting here.
[32:12] They should see tremendous demand going
[32:14] forward on this. Uh, another thing that
[32:18] was brought up on there, if you haven't
[32:19] seen this, and a lot of you are on
[32:21] vacation or not, you know, going around,
[32:23] Doge has been, you know, left for dead
[32:26] in terms of a mindset, but it's not
[32:27] dead. Uh, at least when it comes into
[32:29] the world of regulations. So, the Doge
[32:32] AI project they talked about, uh, the AI
[32:36] system is reviewing 200,000 federal
[32:39] regulations with a goal of eliminating
[32:41] 50% of them by 2026. in the housing and
[32:44] urban development where they reportedly
[32:46] cut 1,083 rules 83 rules in just two
[32:49] weeks. They are trying to make it easier
[32:52] to build stuff. They are trying to make
[32:53] it easier for things to get through.
[32:56] AIdriven deregulation, the path to
[32:58] trillions of dollars of savings. This is
[33:00] the Manhattan project for deregulation.
[33:03] This is the first time in almost 250
[33:05] years now that there's a chance to
[33:07] actually go down in the document stack.
[33:10] You're talking about regulations that
[33:11] have grown every single year. And now
[33:13] we're talking about them saying the goal
[33:15] is to eliminate 50% of the regulations
[33:17] by 2026. If you want to learn more about
[33:20] it, Wired magazine had this in there. It
[33:22] really should be focused on you cannot
[33:24] be bearish on the economy. You cannot be
[33:26] worried about the academic side of the
[33:28] Fed when this is going on. Uh final
[33:31] thing uh and important, they talked a
[33:33] ton about the crypto side. If you guys
[33:35] have not put in the time, the panel
[33:37] framed the new policy. This is the
[33:39] crypto plan as probably the most
[33:41] significant economic legislation and
[33:43] changes that have we've seen in our
[33:45] lifetime. The concept of money and
[33:48] transactions is what the economy is
[33:50] based on. The US crypto plan is going to
[33:53] completely overhaul it and people are
[33:56] still not focused on it in a big enough
[33:58] way. Tokenization is a game changer. If
[34:00] you wanted a license to print money in
[34:01] the past, that would be quite a test.
[34:03] Now you can say, "Give me a dollar. I'll
[34:04] give you a token and this is legal
[34:06] whether or not you agree with it.
[34:07] Tokenization of real world assets like
[34:09] real estate, gold or stocks can unlock
[34:11] trillions of dollars of dormant value.
[34:13] If you own a house and you want to get
[34:14] some money for it, you have to go to the
[34:16] bank. You have to borrow money. You have
[34:18] to pay off interest on it. If you can
[34:20] use tokenization, you can go sell off a
[34:23] part of your house and get the cash and
[34:24] you're not borrowing any money. And
[34:26] maybe you give them an offer on
[34:27] something like using the house two weeks
[34:28] a year. This is going to be common.
[34:31] You're going to release dormant value of
[34:33] dollars. Spend the time on it, people.
[34:36] Get to know it. Tokenization is the real
[34:39] thing. And it is happening and is going
[34:41] to happen in a big big way. We're going
[34:43] to see an explosion in the economy.
[34:46] Transaction explosion. I don't think GDP
[34:48] is going to be measured properly, but
[34:50] let's just leave that for another day.
[34:52] It's really as big a shift in our
[34:54] economy in our economy as I think we've
[34:56] ever seen. People don't understand the
[34:58] Pandora's box that this opens up in
[35:00] innovation.
[35:01] It will everything will be disrupted is
[35:03] basically the thing you need. If you
[35:04] want more on it, the final three slides,
[35:06] an interview with the head strategist of
[35:08] Tether, it was on less noise, more
[35:11] signal. Uh I did the podcast there.
[35:14] These guys are good. Uh Tether is
[35:16] rebuilding the entire capital market
[35:18] stack, replacing not just digitizing
[35:21] every major layer of how capital markets
[35:23] operate. the primary market, secondary
[35:25] markets, clearing and settlement
[35:26] systems, custody, recordkeeping, payment
[35:28] rails, compliance, and reporting.
[35:32] This means designing finance 2.0. I'm
[35:34] not going to take you guys all through
[35:35] it. All I'm going to let you know is AI
[35:38] and crypto is the reason why I do these
[35:40] videos. This has been a major major
[35:42] summer for all of them because of the AI
[35:44] action plan, because of the Genius Act.
[35:47] If you haven't spent the time going
[35:49] through it, the world that you left in
[35:51] June for the summertime has completely
[35:53] changed. And now we are about to
[35:55] accelerate into the second stage of AI,
[35:59] which is not about Nvidia. It's not
[36:02] about the Mag 7. It's about all the
[36:04] companies. Lattis Semiconductor is just
[36:06] an example of a company that's been left
[36:08] for dead. You're going to see cars,
[36:10] millions of robo taxis, which means get
[36:13] the transports ready, get all of the old
[36:15] school industrial stuff ready. PMIs are
[36:18] going higher. See you guys next week.
