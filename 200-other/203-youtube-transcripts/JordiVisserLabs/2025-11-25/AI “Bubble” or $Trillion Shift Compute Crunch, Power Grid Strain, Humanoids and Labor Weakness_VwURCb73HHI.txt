[00:00] to it. Uh not going to read through this
[00:01] stuff. You guys can go through. Uh I
[00:04] will just say that towards the towards
[00:06] the end or the last third. I am going to
[00:09] do a deep dive in the semiconductor
[00:10] names using an interview from Jensen
[00:12] Yuang. A lot of you have asked for uh
[00:15] just some advice on how to use AI more
[00:18] and more from the investment side. So I
[00:20] will spend some time on that. Um there
[00:22] is a theme for this one that I just want
[00:24] to make sure you guys um start the
[00:26] process. You won't lose your job to AI.
[00:28] you'll lose your job to somebody who
[00:30] uses AI. Um Jensen Wang inside or during
[00:34] an interview this week on the BG2 pod,
[00:36] which is the only um podcast I'm going
[00:38] to reference this week, um he went into
[00:41] this and he did basically say that AI is
[00:43] the greatest equalizer. And without
[00:45] reading the entire quote in the entire
[00:47] story, I could not agree more. Um it's
[00:49] the major theme that I think people have
[00:51] to understand is that if you don't want
[00:53] to lose your job, you have to start
[00:54] using AI. If you spend the time on AI,
[00:59] no matter how you've been in your
[01:01] career, you can reinvent yourself
[01:02] because of the power of it if you commit
[01:04] to it. For the week, S&P down slightly,
[01:08] Russell down slightly um after good
[01:12] weeks. GDP numbers. Nominal GDP came in
[01:16] basically at 6% reversing kind of the
[01:19] weakness we had seen over the last three
[01:21] quarters and in particular the first
[01:22] quarter with all the trade disruptions
[01:24] from the tariffs. Um the more stable
[01:29] final sales to domestic purchasers just
[01:32] continues to hum along at very very
[01:34] solid levels without the distortions.
[01:37] This is the thing to look at just to see
[01:38] how stable GDP is. Uh again, this is the
[01:42] real uh side. So came in at 2.9%
[01:45] annualized. And for Q3 so far, we're
[01:48] tracking at 3.9%. So the economy in the
[01:52] first half of the year was under 2%,
[01:54] we're tracking at close to four right
[01:56] now. Let's assume that over the first
[01:58] three quarters with all the tariffs and
[02:00] everything having gone through, we're
[02:01] still going to be a very healthy two and
[02:03] change percent.
[02:05] And at the same time, core PCE uh again
[02:08] for everyone screaming policy mistakes.
[02:11] I can't emphasize enough to people here.
[02:12] The word means nothing. It doesn't do
[02:14] anything to help you make money. It's
[02:16] stupid. Uh and I still read it almost
[02:19] every single day. Core PCE. Now
[02:22] remember, these are the numbers so far.
[02:24] This is the sixmonth rate of change,
[02:28] which has now fallen back to the lowest
[02:29] level since this is all during the
[02:31] tariffs. So for people who were looking
[02:33] for the tariffs to create the inflation,
[02:35] not there. We still have cuts built in.
[02:39] We're 90% for a cut in October at the
[02:42] end of the month. That will be during or
[02:44] just before the Apex summit. I'll get
[02:46] into that, I'm sure, later. Uh and then
[02:48] we still have 70% chance for a cut in
[02:51] December. Again, economy is fine,
[02:55] inflation is fine, and yet the sentiment
[02:58] is still not there in terms of people
[03:00] wanting to be involved in the markets.
[03:02] I'm going to continue to emphasize the
[03:04] commodity side. The XME put up a 2% week
[03:08] and I just want to make sure because I
[03:09] haven't shown this one before. A lot of
[03:11] this been precious metals. It's also
[03:13] been copper, but now you're really
[03:14] getting a widening out. But I just want
[03:16] to emphasize these are weekly charts.
[03:18] So, back to April. The XME has been up
[03:20] every single week except one in August.
[03:23] No other part of the market has done
[03:25] this. Part of that is gold. Yes. But
[03:27] like I said, part of this is the copex,
[03:29] the copper uh part which is in there. Uh
[03:33] got to give a shout out to Colin Fenton
[03:35] who's been all over this. If you haven't
[03:37] been following his work, uh this is
[03:39] something he put out on June uh 30th
[03:42] which just emphasized and this is the
[03:44] the part I really think is an important
[03:45] part. The copper cycle now underway
[03:46] began in February of 2024. We believe
[03:48] copper will most likely continue to
[03:50] strengthen for at least 3 years in what
[03:52] we expect more broadly to be one of the
[03:54] strongest environments for commodity
[03:55] markets in decades. He and I are on the
[03:58] same page of this um for different
[04:00] reasons I think and that's what makes it
[04:02] so interesting. Colin's a long-term
[04:04] supply and demand person uh in
[04:06] commodities and I'm doing this purely
[04:08] from the AI demand story and the
[04:10] buildout that has to happen in power. We
[04:12] got another signal that this week he
[04:13] published this in terms of the PGM West
[04:16] power price surge on tight capacity uh
[04:19] aside from the price move. The move
[04:21] comes as governors from several PGM
[04:22] states including Pennsylvania and
[04:24] Virginia convene to voice concerns over
[04:26] rising retail power costs and tightness
[04:30] in the grid. Uh the commodity side is
[04:33] not isolated to the metals. XLE posted
[04:37] its best month since June,
[04:40] continues to have a great looking chart.
[04:42] XOP, great looking chart as well. Uh,
[04:46] again, best week since June. So, you're
[04:48] getting the oil and production side
[04:50] joining and Hallebertton uh broke
[04:54] through the 200 day moving average for
[04:56] the first time
[04:58] since April of last year.
[05:00] So, you're getting changes. And one of
[05:02] the things that's starting to become
[05:03] more evident, the Dallas Fed energy
[05:05] survey for Q3 was released, uh, and I'm
[05:08] not going to read all the quotes in
[05:10] here, but you can see that it's going to
[05:13] be really hard. The US shell business is
[05:15] broken. What was once the world's most
[05:16] dynamic energy engine has been gutted by
[05:18] political hostility and economic
[05:20] ignorance. The previous administration
[05:22] vilified the industry.
[05:25] The current administration is finishing
[05:27] the job. This whole thing and all these
[05:30] quotes are just about the fact that you
[05:32] can't invest make long-term investments
[05:34] and why would anyone make investments
[05:36] right now in energy if in three and a
[05:38] half years the policies completely
[05:40] change. So the uncertainty in the energy
[05:42] policy is going to hurt the supply side
[05:44] in the US and I think that's going to
[05:46] contribute to some of the commodity
[05:47] side. The Deutsche Bank uh the DBC the
[05:50] Deutsche Bank commodity ETF chart looks
[05:53] like a reverse head and shoulders. It's
[05:55] up. I overlaid this over the last 15
[05:57] years with the six contract of crude. Um
[06:01] commodities have a bid and I think
[06:03] people should pay attention. This is the
[06:05] basing chart of the total return index
[06:07] of that DBC. Uh and then here is the
[06:10] chart itself. So the commodity side
[06:12] looks good. Um variant perception put
[06:15] out this thing on their advanced
[06:16] commodity side six month forward also
[06:19] looking higher. So I would focus again
[06:22] on the commodity side for next year.
[06:23] It's part of my PMI theme. Uh jobs. So
[06:28] I'm going to go through this and try to
[06:29] go through it quickly. Uh the month of
[06:31] September, there's been a lot of things
[06:33] on the job market. Uh Zoom CEO came out
[06:36] basically agreed with what Bill Gates,
[06:38] Jamie Diamond, Jensen Yuang have said,
[06:40] which is a three-day work week is coming
[06:41] soon. This is really important
[06:44] especially for macro people to start to
[06:45] build into their expectations about what
[06:47] the AI situation is going to do. The
[06:49] jobs market. I've talked about this a
[06:51] lot. I've talked about it with the
[06:52] academic Fed. I cannot emphasize it
[06:54] enough that this is going to be a major
[06:57] theme for the next 5 years leading into
[07:01] humanoids. Bosch plans to cut 13,000
[07:03] jobs. So, we got Germany in the play.
[07:05] Germany's not just there on that. You've
[07:07] got SAP saying AI will help us afford to
[07:10] have less people, but if we do it wrong,
[07:12] it could be a catastrophe.
[07:15] Tech sector layoffs accelerate. So, here
[07:17] we are. We have a boom going on in AI.
[07:20] You've seen all of the infrastructure uh
[07:22] GDP contribution from the technology
[07:25] sector and yet last year we saw job
[07:29] losses of over 280,000 and this year
[07:31] we're already pointing to 235,000 by
[07:34] year and half a million in two years.
[07:36] Seasonal hiring for retail spectated it
[07:39] lowest level since09. The IBO is great
[07:41] for stocks not for jobs. This is an
[07:44] article from Ox from Axios this uh this
[07:47] month. There's a real possibility we
[07:49] could kill millions of people
[07:52] have could have millions of people put
[07:54] out of work by artificial intelligence.
[07:55] Upskilling is necessary. Neil Cash
[07:58] Carry, one of the Fed uh presidents, uh
[08:03] had this quote, while it takes a lot of
[08:04] people to build a new data center, it
[08:05] takes relatively few to operate one.
[08:07] This is becoming a major story. And as a
[08:10] crowdsourcer, I just noticed that in the
[08:12] podcast I listened to this week, inside
[08:14] all the articles that I sourced for in
[08:16] the labor market, there is real uh news
[08:20] happening. And I think this has to do
[08:22] with this, which is Darius Amodi
[08:27] uh the head of anthropic basically said
[08:29] the government need to step in and
[08:31] support people as AI quickly displaces
[08:34] human work. you need some kind of policy
[08:37] response at the scale of disruption we
[08:39] expect in the next 5 years. Now he has
[08:41] talked about this for the white collar
[08:43] side but it is very clear to me that
[08:45] with inside the tech world the people in
[08:47] charge of these models are already
[08:49] seeing the rise of the white collar
[08:51] disruption which is going to come from
[08:53] AI agents and the stories that I'll keep
[08:55] going through here are represented. So
[08:57] again, if you're a macro person sitting
[08:59] there, policy mistake, blah blah blah,
[09:01] all this stuff that goes on, you have to
[09:03] start incorporating the fact that the
[09:05] labor market has broken away from GDP.
[09:07] That is a major story that has
[09:09] implications for rates. It has major
[09:11] implications for uh civil unrest and
[09:13] kind of the anger that's going on in the
[09:15] country. Fiverr, if you've never heard
[09:16] of Fiverr, think of Fiverr as a cheap
[09:19] outsource labor company. Uh I've used
[09:22] them for for my business. Fiverr to cut
[09:25] about 250 jobs and refocusing effort
[09:27] re-entered guidance. The whole thing
[09:29] they're talking about in this is related
[09:32] to AI by cutting 30% of their own
[09:34] internal workforce restructuring. Fiverr
[09:36] is effectively saying even cheap
[09:38] outsource human work is now being
[09:40] replaced by AI. So, I wanted to go
[09:42] through this with chat GPT to just say,
[09:44] what is this signal when we're getting
[09:46] to the point where a company that
[09:48] canvases the world to help you with
[09:51] cheap labor is now reaching a point
[09:53] where they have to focus on their job to
[09:56] make sure if they're going to survive
[09:57] that they're AI focused. So, Anthropics
[10:00] co-founders say the likelihood of AI
[10:01] replacing human jobs is so high that
[10:03] they needed to warn the world about it.
[10:08] Anthropic is the most important LLM for
[10:10] coding and API usage. They dominate.
[10:13] Okay. Anthropic employees and leadership
[10:15] strongly maintain that agent progress is
[10:18] accelerating and expect the pace to
[10:19] continue faster and faster. So again,
[10:21] the agentic side is the white collar
[10:23] disruption. This is where computers will
[10:25] be doing and making more of the
[10:27] decisions. You won't need as many
[10:29] people. You'll have some, but this is
[10:31] when you really start to get the
[10:32] advancement on this. And this is what is
[10:35] happening now in a very fast pace.
[10:36] Anthropic predicts extremely capable AI
[10:39] systems and agent proliferation could be
[10:41] widespread as soon as 2026, 2027,
[10:44] potentially matching or exceeding the
[10:46] intellectual abilities of specialized
[10:48] human experts. I'll get more into that
[10:50] in terms of what's happening. In
[10:52] September, on September 9th, 40
[10:54] economists
[10:56] sent a letter to the Secretary of Labor
[11:00] urging them to pay attention and monitor
[11:03] AI's impact. We are a coalition of
[11:05] economists. While we may have differing
[11:07] views of the impacts A will have, we are
[11:08] knight in the belief that we should
[11:10] ensure American workers are not left
[11:11] behind as the rise of AI comes. On this
[11:14] list, Ben Bernani and Janet Yellen. We
[11:19] are concerned the government is not
[11:20] adequately prepared for this challenge
[11:22] and strongly want to emphasize the
[11:23] importance of highquality data that is
[11:24] granular and timely blah blah blah blah
[11:26] blah. The only thing that matters out of
[11:28] this is people are starting to realize
[11:30] more and more in conversations how fast
[11:33] this is accelerating. This is why I want
[11:34] to bring up this company MKER which I'm
[11:36] sure very few people on this have heard.
[11:40] They're eyeing a $10 billion valuation.
[11:42] The person who runs the company is 22
[11:45] years old.
[11:47] They already have an ARR of half a
[11:50] billion dollars. So what does this
[11:52] company do?
[11:54] This company helps bypass the friction
[11:57] of human adoption. And the way that they
[12:00] do that is that they bring in experts to
[12:04] help with the training of the models. So
[12:07] they bring in a lawyer, they bring in a
[12:09] banker, they bring in a health care
[12:11] person. and where the hallucinations and
[12:14] the things are because they don't have
[12:16] an LLM that can have all of the
[12:19] knowledge that a human being would have
[12:21] through the experience. This company
[12:23] pays over $200,000
[12:27] to help
[12:29] get human expertise and experience into
[12:31] training fuel for its own obsolescence
[12:34] in effect. And I asked the question, is
[12:36] this a new form of capitalism
[12:38] cannibalizing itself? So basically this
[12:40] company pays people to come in and train
[12:44] the models in a reinforcement learning
[12:47] human feedback way which has become part
[12:49] of the model training in general. But
[12:50] this is for specialization
[12:53] and the reason that they have so much
[12:55] revenue is because the companies that
[12:57] are paying them
[13:00] are meta are open AI. It is the bigger
[13:03] companies on the hyperscaler side who
[13:05] want their models improved. This is one
[13:06] of the places these companies are going
[13:08] to get lots of revenue from selling this
[13:10] to law firms, from selling this to
[13:12] specialized. So, they're building
[13:14] specialized models, specialized LLMs
[13:17] specifically for certain industries and
[13:20] they're using humans to help speed up
[13:22] the process of the reinforcement
[13:23] learning. Reinforcement learning was a
[13:25] big part of the deepseek side. All of
[13:27] this has become there because RLHF
[13:30] using human feedback is part of what is
[13:33] speeding this process. Also Google
[13:35] researchers come out with a a paper also
[13:39] in midepptember warning of a looming AI
[13:40] run economies. Basically what this one
[13:43] is going through is that it's going to
[13:45] be an AI agent economy. The transactions
[13:47] will happening AI to a agent AI agent
[13:51] which means less people involved in the
[13:53] process. It goes through this. I'm not
[13:55] going to read all of this. You guys can
[13:56] go read the paper on your own. The paper
[13:58] is careful not to claim all jobs
[14:00] disappear. It acknowledges limits
[14:01] challenges and transitional friction.
[14:04] But it does talk about the fact again
[14:06] that the increase or the correlation
[14:09] between the job market and GDP is what's
[14:11] breaking down. Now the reason this is so
[14:14] important for everyone to focus on the
[14:16] global labor market is about $60
[14:18] trillion annually. Global corporate
[14:20] profits are about 6 to 7 trillion. This
[14:23] is how important AI is and why this will
[14:26] not stop in terms of going through the
[14:30] wage bill and this is where people
[14:32] believe the productivity is going to
[14:34] come from is going to come from cutting
[14:36] that $60 trillion. Theoretically, if you
[14:39] cut it to zero, the question is how high
[14:42] would global GDP be? If it stays at 105
[14:44] trillion, then obviously you have a
[14:46] massive boom in corporate profits.
[14:49] Does that mean is that the productivity
[14:50] boom? So this is where I go through it.
[14:52] This is my angle on this. I've talked
[14:54] about the the dangers involved in terms
[14:56] of the job market and why I don't I it's
[14:59] very hard for me to imagine comparing
[15:01] the industrial revolution productivity
[15:03] boom to what we're going to see now. And
[15:05] the reason is the replacement of jobs.
[15:08] So in the industrial revolution, even
[15:10] though it boosted human labor
[15:12] productivity, labor was still central.
[15:13] Factories needed workers to operate,
[15:15] manage, and use it. Scarcity preserved.
[15:18] Output per worker rose. Scarcity
[15:20] preserved is very important in this
[15:22] because this is my belief is that we
[15:24] start getting to scarcity. So in an
[15:26] abundant economy where machines are
[15:28] actually creating machines to replace
[15:30] themselves,
[15:31] people are not needed to the degree that
[15:33] they were. And I'm not in any way
[15:34] believing there will be no people
[15:36] working. I just believe that the ability
[15:38] to have the correlation between GDP
[15:41] growth and labor has completely broken
[15:43] down and will only worsen in the next 5
[15:44] years, particularly as we get to robo
[15:46] taxis and humanoids. There is not a fast
[15:49] enough way for people to be reskilled
[15:51] because of how fast this is moving. As
[15:54] scarcity collapses, if energy data and
[15:56] raws are abundant, the marginal cost of
[15:59] goods and services trends towards zero,
[16:02] prices collapse, transitions vanish, GDP
[16:04] contracts. Even if material prosperity
[16:08] goes higher, isn't GDP to a great degree
[16:11] based on scarcity and inflation? GDP is
[16:14] built on a framework of scarcity and
[16:16] monetary exchange, not on abundance.
[16:19] This is the reason why I say GDP cannot
[16:21] measure it. If something is abundant,
[16:22] air, sunlight, it has little or no price
[16:24] and GDP ignores it, even if it's crucial
[16:26] for life. GDP is isn't a measure of
[16:28] value and use, but a value of exchange.
[16:31] Labor costs are a huge component over
[16:33] half of global GDP. As wages rise, so
[16:36] does GDP. If wages disappear, that
[16:38] feedback loop breaks down. That's the
[16:40] thing we're getting to is that you're
[16:42] disrupting this whole process and all
[16:44] the measurements uh in 5 years. And I
[16:47] wrote this in here. I don't know if GDP
[16:49] will be around in 10 years. I'm sure the
[16:51] measurement will not be here. We're in
[16:52] the final stages of GDP being a useful
[16:55] measure. It will need to be completely
[16:56] rethunk uh based on what's happening. So
[16:59] I put this substack in where I go
[17:01] through the disruption that's happening
[17:04] and there's a rebirth that's coming out
[17:06] on the other side is going to be a new
[17:08] system, but people need to adjust. So
[17:11] here we are on the on the labor side.
[17:12] This is the year-over-year payroll
[17:14] numbers, which are now at 85 basis
[17:16] points. We've got 85 basis points of
[17:18] increased labor. We've never been at
[17:20] these levels without there being a
[17:22] recession. the unemployment rate. Marco
[17:25] Papage put this out
[17:27] uh or reposted something and this is
[17:29] basically showing again how we've got
[17:32] the recent graduates unemployment rate
[17:35] up to a very high level. The last time
[17:36] we were at this level or every time
[17:38] we've been been at this level, we've had
[17:40] a very similar thing on all workers. So
[17:42] the unemployment rate is hanging in
[17:44] there, but the pressure is growing. So
[17:47] this is a chart of the unemployment rate
[17:49] inverted the purple line in here. You've
[17:51] got a whole bunch of different things.
[17:53] You've got temp jobs. This is the New
[17:56] York Fed expectation of or probability
[17:59] of getting a job within a year collapse
[18:02] or this and again you've got all of
[18:04] these things happening. I've got the
[18:06] Jolts quits in there. Uh and I've got
[18:09] the jobs hard to get in the uh that's
[18:12] the red line here from the conference
[18:13] board and this is tenure rates. anyone
[18:17] still focusing on shorting bonds because
[18:20] of the deficit in debt, yelling policy
[18:22] mistake, thinking there's inflation, the
[18:25] gravity pull right now is on the labor
[18:27] market. You're going to need to see a
[18:29] dramatic shift in the labor market as
[18:32] AI accelerates, as agents are coming, as
[18:35] robo taxies are coming, asoids. This
[18:38] doesn't seem like a hard thing to figure
[18:40] out. uh these deflationary pressures
[18:42] should continue and I think that's
[18:44] what's going to uh continue to put more
[18:46] pressure on governments to move rates
[18:48] lower because of the anger that's going
[18:50] to be happening from people that are
[18:52] having trouble in their jobs that at a
[18:53] minimum are worried about their jobs. Uh
[18:55] variant perception just had another one.
[18:57] I I just bring this up here because of
[18:59] the rate situation. It's not just US
[19:01] rates. This is the the business cycle
[19:03] financing index overlaid with with small
[19:05] cap. Again, I think commodities are
[19:08] going higher, PMIs are going higher, all
[19:10] on the back of the AI buildout, and that
[19:12] means that to me, small caps are going
[19:14] to end up being the surprise uh winner
[19:16] next year, just because a rising tide
[19:17] will will lift all boats. It was another
[19:20] week for the AI bubble theme. And this
[19:23] is where I want to make sure this is the
[19:24] best advice I can give you guys. If I do
[19:26] work, I definitely do work more than all
[19:28] the people writing these, all the people
[19:30] speaking about it. I will take you
[19:32] through the AI situation and the
[19:34] spending, but you have to connect all
[19:36] the dots. These articles are just random
[19:38] BS that comes out and people put up
[19:40] charts like this. Oh, look at all this
[19:42] spending. That means it's going to
[19:43] collapse. This is a once in a-lifetime
[19:45] situation of converting the entire world
[19:48] from nonAI to AI. That's what it is.
[19:51] Every single thing that you own in your
[19:53] home, every single thing that you're in
[19:54] in a car, every single thing in a phone
[19:57] will have artificial intelligence in
[19:58] there to get there. We are not even
[20:00] close to the amount of supply that's
[20:02] necessary. Will there be bad
[20:04] investments? Yes, absolutely. If you ask
[20:06] me, I'm sure at least five of the mag
[20:08] seven will have a hard time justifying
[20:10] what they're spending money on, but that
[20:12] doesn't matter for making money in the
[20:14] next few years. Uh playing short those
[20:16] companies is just going to kill you. So,
[20:18] you had the Nvidia investment for
[20:21] hundred billion that got everyone going.
[20:22] The incestuous behavior between these
[20:25] companies now Sam Alman on worries about
[20:27] OpenAI 850 billion. I totally get that.
[20:30] I'm not going to go through that guy's
[20:33] stuff. Um, again, the capex spend, 1
[20:36] trillion of capex, 20 billion of AI is a
[20:39] bubble. David Einhorn sounds warning on
[20:40] AI spending splurge. And again, I agree
[20:43] with the fact that not all these
[20:44] companies are going to be able to
[20:45] justify it. Um, tech bubble on the GDP
[20:49] side because we got another quarter of
[20:50] just massive tech spend that's showing
[20:52] up in GDP. and Oracle. You can't see the
[20:56] Oracle thing in here, but they went out
[20:57] and borrowed money and everyone freaked
[20:59] out about that. And of course, to start
[21:01] the week, our usual clickbait. Let's put
[21:04] this out there. This one from Bane. An
[21:05] $800 billion revenue shortfall threatens
[21:08] AI future. AI companies will need $2
[21:11] trillion in combined annual revenue to
[21:12] fund computing power by 2030, but their
[21:14] revenue is likely to fall 800 billion
[21:16] short. This might be the most ridiculous
[21:18] thing I've ever read. uh how anyone can
[21:21] predict exponential what's going to
[21:23] happen when everyone was wrong when the
[21:25] iPhone came out by a factor of of
[21:28] infinity. Uh and I'll go through this.
[21:32] I asked the question and went through
[21:34] this on based on the report that they
[21:37] put is safe to uh that Bane did not
[21:39] think about a broad basis for their
[21:41] analysis meaning going through all of
[21:44] the potential implications robo taxis
[21:46] healthcare everything of where revenues
[21:48] could come as opposed to just isolating
[21:51] it to the seven companies in terms of
[21:53] their spend. So if you're doing it
[21:55] versus the hyperscalers versus the
[21:56] revenue again I still think you're going
[21:59] to be wrong in there but we'll go
[22:00] through this. The internet forecast 90s
[22:03] they modeled revenues solely as
[22:05] advertising
[22:06] smartphones focused on device sales not
[22:09] apps not this. You have no idea what
[22:11] part and what spending will be
[22:14] redirected towards AI. Jensen Yu Wang on
[22:16] the interview said they're already
[22:19] already at trillions of dollars purely
[22:22] based on the cloud revenues in terms of
[22:23] what's coming through. Now again his
[22:25] argument is not about incremental it's
[22:27] just about converting all the stuff they
[22:29] have. So we'll go through that as well
[22:31] when we get to the interview. But the
[22:33] main point is here what what you missed
[22:35] when you predicted on on the iPhone
[22:38] e-commerce, social networks, cloud is
[22:39] ser all of these things came out of it.
[22:41] You couldn't have it without it. AI is
[22:43] moving much faster. In 5 years you're
[22:46] talking about what's equivalent to 50
[22:47] years of innovation, even faster than
[22:49] what happened with the smartphone. And
[22:51] again, when I go through and talk about
[22:53] robo taxis and humanoids alone, the
[22:56] revenues are extreme. in one of the Mag
[22:58] 7 and one of the hyperscalers now is
[23:00] Tesla in terms of spending money on
[23:01] building out their own AI.
[23:04] So smartphones in 2007, no one got
[23:07] anything related to it. How could they?
[23:09] You're going to have the same thing
[23:10] going on. You will have new categories
[23:13] to generate it. I just put in these
[23:16] about how much money and the savings
[23:17] that will come through per year if AI is
[23:21] just used in these forms. Uh drug
[23:24] discovery all of them. So the AI bubble
[23:27] thing is just ridiculous. That being
[23:28] said, this was good a good article by
[23:31] Michael Semolist and really it was just
[23:33] a thing. He called it the data center
[23:35] blob just to talk about how big and
[23:37] massive this has been. And I think the
[23:39] most interesting part that he went into
[23:41] first of all AI direct impact to the S&P
[23:45] 500
[23:47] basically
[23:49] 181%.
[23:51] 65 for these the cap equipment X AI
[23:55] basically nothing. It's responsible for
[23:56] all the earnings growth. It's
[23:57] responsible for all the capex and uh
[24:01] R&D.
[24:04] The blob is overtaking markets. So his
[24:06] whole theory here is that just 40 stocks
[24:09] are driving the bulk of the market. Uh
[24:12] and that's been what's been going on.
[24:13] And I think obviously that's going to
[24:15] change. That's why I said a tide that
[24:16] lifts all boats. It's been isolated to
[24:18] these groups. I think this is going to
[24:20] change. Borrowing is now expanding it.
[24:22] This gets into the oracle thing. So he
[24:24] just highlights that this is a huge
[24:26] concentration and he said he's never
[24:28] seen anything like this before. The
[24:30] positive side, the concentration means
[24:33] that when AIdriven names falter, the
[24:35] broader market could suffer
[24:36] disappropriatently. This is what I want
[24:37] to get into because everyone has felt
[24:39] this. When I started doing stuff with
[24:40] 22V, I started having more and more
[24:42] conversations with portfolio managers
[24:44] and the frustration they run into in
[24:46] every single vertical, whether it's
[24:47] utilities, whether it's the industrial
[24:50] side or whether it's the AI side.
[24:53] Whenever something happens in Nvidia or
[24:56] in some name, the entire space falls and
[24:59] people just have to get used to it. When
[25:01] you that concentrated and that
[25:03] everything is driving the market, that's
[25:05] what happens. Since chat GPT came out,
[25:08] Nvidia is up 12 times.
[25:12] 12 times. During that 12 times, there's
[25:17] been one 2 3 4 retest five, six, seven,
[25:25] seven, 20% corrections during the
[25:27] period. Five of those went before they
[25:30] got to new all-time highs. two of them
[25:32] where they came down, retested, came
[25:34] back, and then went through this. You're
[25:36] going to have a lot. That's in three
[25:37] less than three years. We had five 20
[25:40] plus% corrections. We had three 25%
[25:43] corrections.
[25:45] People just have to get used to the fact
[25:47] that this is part of what goes on with
[25:49] AI because the majority of the index and
[25:52] the majority of the country is still in
[25:54] a recession and that's where the
[25:56] majority of people work. So you're in
[25:59] this thing of that's why it feels like a
[26:01] recession all the time because
[26:02] technically using the old methodologies
[26:05] and not including AI this is a recession
[26:08] now
[26:10] I asked chat GPT based on this 40 names
[26:13] within would it be difficult for port
[26:15] managers to risk manage during these
[26:17] times when 40 names are driving 70 80%
[26:20] of earnings growth
[26:22] they are the index this creates two
[26:24] interlocking problems correlation spikes
[26:26] and stress periods I think everyone sees
[26:28] that that's what I was talking about.
[26:29] These things can be uncorrelated for
[26:31] periods of time, but when there's a
[26:32] correction and the market sells off or
[26:34] AI sells off, they all go down together
[26:36] and they have multiple standard
[26:37] deviation moves because if a utility
[26:39] stock is going up 30% a year, of course,
[26:41] it can have a 15% correction. That might
[26:43] be higher than historic than history,
[26:46] but it can sell off. It can also go
[26:47] sideways for a year just because it's
[26:49] had a big move. We've seen that in some
[26:50] of the REITs this year that are still
[26:52] nothing has changed on that front. um
[26:55] option markets and what I basically got
[26:57] into is puts become fairly useless in
[27:01] this point at the index level. Uh but
[27:05] where I go through and ask the question
[27:06] and this is the hedging strategy where I
[27:08] think people should start to pay
[27:09] attention to which is volaval they
[27:12] should be looking at VIX options they
[27:14] should be timing these things. Uh
[27:16] there's more details you guys can read
[27:17] on your own. And this is what has
[27:20] happened is when Nvidia has gone has
[27:22] peaked relative to the S&P and gone down
[27:25] and that's it. Just when it's peaked on
[27:26] a relative basis and gone down, we get
[27:29] these episodic spikes eventually after
[27:32] it goes on. We've had them in all of
[27:34] these places um where it's gone on.
[27:36] Well, right now we have another Nvidia
[27:38] peak. This happened literally at the
[27:41] chat GPT5 launch. There's no reason for
[27:44] it. Their earnings have been great.
[27:46] There's nothing going on. I did come out
[27:48] and say in this period in here that I
[27:50] thought we would have a period of Nvidia
[27:52] underperforming. I still think that's
[27:54] likely. Uh Jensen Yuang tried to change
[27:56] my mind on this, but I think the timing
[27:58] of this is just uh not good for them
[28:01] relative to other semis which I've been
[28:03] talking about and I'll go through but
[28:05] we're in one of those situations. So the
[28:06] question is are we going to get a spike?
[28:09] VIX calls are cheap right now relative
[28:10] to where they will be if we get a spike.
[28:13] So here's the interview. highly
[28:15] recommend you go spend it not just
[28:16] because Jensen Yuang is on but because
[28:18] Brad Gersonner is so smart in this that
[28:20] the questions are really really good in
[28:22] the way he approaches it. So just to go
[28:24] through it clear the inferenceship which
[28:26] I've highlighted time and time again
[28:27] with with reasoning inference demand is
[28:29] expected to grow by orders of magnitude
[28:31] 100 times a thousand times 1 billion
[28:33] times he goes through the three scaling
[28:36] laws we did pre-training okay
[28:38] post-training reinforcement learning
[28:40] this is the thing that I mentioned with
[28:42] Mker this has become one of the big
[28:44] additions then you've got the inference
[28:46] reasoning thinking before answering this
[28:48] has been the one that has used up more
[28:50] capacity
[28:51] goes through the deal talks about why he
[28:54] talks about all the the multiple
[28:57] exponential demand
[28:59] and then he goes through and highlights
[29:02] to you general purpose computing is
[29:04] over. So everything that you're using
[29:06] today is a dead machine. The future
[29:10] which is coming every single day. I
[29:12] ordered my first iPhone in the last four
[29:14] years because I decided that whatever
[29:18] limited AI was on the phone, I wanted to
[29:20] start to get used to it and figure it
[29:22] out. I did the same thing in my day with
[29:25] AI and there's enough going on in it to
[29:27] pay attention. The hyperscaler shifting
[29:29] workloads from CPUs to GPUs.
[29:32] This alone equals hundreds of billions
[29:34] in infrastructure refresh
[29:37] labor augmentation. Again, this is going
[29:40] through the argument of the revenues
[29:42] that are going to be associated. He's
[29:43] talking about how big the capex is going
[29:45] to be. So for people that think it's a
[29:46] capex bubble and it's going to come
[29:48] down, it isn't. Token generation is
[29:51] doubling every few months. Energy and
[29:52] compute are now direct revenue drivers.
[29:55] Energy and compute, it is the focal
[29:57] focal point of everything that I talk
[29:59] about. It is the only thing I think from
[30:01] an investment standpoint that makes
[30:03] sense is to focus on energy investments
[30:05] and compute. all the other things
[30:08] including shorting things doesn't make
[30:10] sense to me other than maybe software
[30:13] but in terms of like focusing your
[30:15] attention you want to spend your time on
[30:16] energy and compute the bubble debate and
[30:19] he goes through it and what he says is
[30:20] until all classical computing shifts to
[30:23] accelerated AI the chance of a glut is
[30:26] extremely low this is really critical
[30:30] prisoners dilemma dynamic every
[30:32] hyperscaler must build aggressively no
[30:34] one can risk being left behind I've
[30:36] talked talked about this for the
[30:37] hyperscalers. This is also true for
[30:39] China versus the US. They are spending
[30:41] and I'm going to go through China's
[30:42] spending. So it's not just the US
[30:44] companies like Metadmit they may
[30:46] overspend by 10 billion but the risk is
[30:48] existential not optional. That's why
[30:50] they will continue to spend. Their
[30:52] boards cannot convince them otherwise.
[30:54] Accelerated computing plus AI not just
[30:58] GPUs. When he talks about accelerate he
[31:00] means the broad shift away from general
[31:02] purpose again to move away from
[31:03] computers. Now what I wanted to go
[31:05] through and this is where I start the
[31:07] question for everyone here is what does
[31:11] the world look like the next phase. So
[31:14] as the world moves to AI embodiment
[31:17] they're critical for edge and there NPUs
[31:20] fit into the equation. I've talked about
[31:21] NPUs
[31:24] within the interview with Jensen Wang.
[31:25] Did he acknowledge that they continue to
[31:27] make efficiency gains? Yes. He said
[31:29] massively they have efficiency gains
[31:31] with every chip generation. So the next
[31:33] time you hear someone say, "Oh, are
[31:35] there going to be efficiency gains?"
[31:37] Every single chip that they released is
[31:39] focused on a metric in tokens per watt,
[31:41] they are absolutely every single one of
[31:43] the new architectures delivers massive
[31:46] jumps in performance per watt. So the
[31:48] next time you hear, "Are they going to
[31:50] go through this?" It already is
[31:51] happening. It's been happening every
[31:53] single day. So it is ridiculous at this
[31:55] point to sit there and worry about even
[31:57] that the demand is just higher than
[32:00] supply. And here's the thing. If AI
[32:02] demand was not moving so fast, would
[32:04] this allow other chip companies to catch
[32:06] up? And the answer is yes, you can go
[32:10] through. They'd have more breathing
[32:11] room. If it wasn't moving so fast and
[32:14] Nvidia would go to one-year release
[32:15] cycle. So everything would change except
[32:18] for the fact that AI is going so fast.
[32:21] With demand exploding, hyperscalers need
[32:23] the full stack solution now, not a
[32:25] partial answer late. If someone tapes
[32:28] out an ASIC today, they're solving last
[32:30] year's problem. By the time they
[32:31] deliver, the industry has moved on. This
[32:33] is the reason why Nvidia has a moat.
[32:36] It's moving so fast. They built the
[32:38] scale for this. Everyone's now trying to
[32:40] compete with them. But they have a new
[32:42] chip constantly coming out with better
[32:44] efficiency. So why would you buy the
[32:47] older stuff? You can't do it. And you
[32:48] certainly can't take the time to try
[32:51] something if it's not going to work.
[32:54] Your time is over. This is why Nvidia's
[32:58] had the moat.
[32:59] Their AI server orders are so big
[33:02] they're unimaginable, says a separate
[33:04] computer place. So, this is where I
[33:07] wanted to go and I'm I I wanted to get
[33:09] me get me to a point where ChachPpt
[33:11] answered the question using both what
[33:13] Jensen said and what's out there. So, if
[33:16] there's still a restriction on V3, which
[33:18] is the video usage from from uh uh from
[33:22] Google Gemini, there can't be a glut
[33:25] yet.
[33:26] V3. And yes, you've connected the dots.
[33:29] Well, let's frame it clearly. You go
[33:30] through it. Video is too compute
[33:33] inensive. You still can't run it at
[33:36] scale. You can only run it in limited
[33:38] access. It is rationed out. Demand is
[33:41] greater than supply because they won't
[33:43] allow you to use it. No glut until all
[33:46] count generation is AIdriven. This is
[33:48] what Jensen said. Glut air pockets.
[33:52] There's going to be then it asked me,
[33:54] and this is now what it's happening, uh,
[33:56] to build a checklist of signals. So here
[33:58] we go. These are the things to look for
[34:00] for when supply is starting to get ahead
[34:04] of demand on just any one of these six.
[34:07] None of these are happening and I'm not
[34:09] going to go read them all. Um H high
[34:11] bandwidth memory supply tightness. I'll
[34:13] get into that because this is there. We
[34:14] got power constraints the secondary
[34:16] market. These are all the checklists of
[34:18] what would be there. So in glut signals,
[34:21] you know, when V3 is offered more
[34:23] broadly, uh, capex growth is flattening,
[34:25] you start seeing them cancel some of
[34:27] this stuff. Right now, all we see are
[34:29] shortage signals. A true glut cycle
[34:31] would require all three layers to
[34:33] saturate. So we're not there. So every
[34:36] time that you get this bubble talk that
[34:38] happens, the good news is we're going to
[34:40] get a correction. when you get the
[34:42] correction,
[34:43] go to technicals or have some VIX call
[34:45] options on uh beforehand and then put
[34:48] yourself in a position where you're
[34:49] still focused. I do believe there's
[34:51] going to be a rotation and I, you know,
[34:53] I've talked about that. I'll get into
[34:54] that in some of the semis. Now, if you
[34:56] don't believe if you think the US is in
[34:58] a bubble, then why is China doing all
[35:00] this stuff? So, Alibaba stock surges as
[35:03] Eddie Woo announces 53 billion AI
[35:05] spending plan. uh so they increased
[35:08] their spending and saying the speed of
[35:10] AI industry growth and suggested global
[35:12] investment could reach four trillion in
[35:14] five years.
[35:16] He stated Alibaba will increase his data
[35:18] center capacity by 10 times between now
[35:21] and the end of decade. This is actually
[35:22] more than the four to five times that
[35:25] Jensen said in there and they talked
[35:27] about this on there. If Alib alone is
[35:29] going 10 times in power then Nvidia's
[35:31] four to five estimate might actually be
[35:32] conservative.
[35:34] Nvidia's revenue is directly correlated
[35:36] to power. It's correlated to watts. It's
[35:39] another demand signal that there's no
[35:41] glut. And it's not just them. So, Bank
[35:44] America went through it put the number
[35:45] that the Chinese hyperscalers are now at
[35:48] for this year at 85 to 98.
[35:53] Now,
[35:55] this 85 to 98 is different than the US
[35:58] one. It doesn't include the grid
[36:00] capacity or the energy side which a lot
[36:02] of the numbers for the capex for some of
[36:05] the hyperscalers that also they're
[36:06] spending tons of money right now on the
[36:08] energy side private sector in the US or
[36:12] in China they're spending tons of money
[36:15] on this and to give you an idea in 2024
[36:19] China spent over $625 billion on clean
[36:22] energy alone
[36:25] this one put the number at clean energy
[36:27] investment at 940 billion 10 record 10%
[36:30] of GDP in China. China observers are
[36:34] shocked at how US grid limits and lack
[36:35] of coordinated investment are slowing AI
[36:37] demand center buildout.
[36:40] Contrasting with the China's rapid
[36:41] demand,
[36:43] there's a bottleneck.
[36:45] They talk about the fact that demand is
[36:48] a key reason it expects to leapfrog new
[36:50] data center demand in the U to leaprog
[36:53] the US and AI infrastructure.
[36:55] This could hurt in being competitive at
[36:57] all. It looks like a competitive red
[37:00] flag. This is one of the reasons why
[37:01] I've talked about you're going to have
[37:03] for the first time for the Mag 7 global
[37:05] competition. It's certainly going to be
[37:07] in Asia. It's certainly going to be
[37:08] partly in the Middle East, but they are
[37:10] doing a lot. And what Bite Dance came
[37:12] out and basically said the rapid growth
[37:14] in token consumption from 50 trillion in
[37:16] 2025
[37:18] to 10 times the number in 2026. So
[37:21] again, I we just had 10 times for
[37:24] Google. You're talking about everything
[37:26] around the globe accelerating. Huawei
[37:28] unveils their own data center side to
[37:30] compete with Nvidia. So, another sign of
[37:33] there being no glut, the semiconductors.
[37:35] So, I've shown this chart before. This
[37:37] is the one of the DRAMs overlaid with
[37:40] the PMIs. It has had another sharp move
[37:42] higher. Uh, so you've got DRAM prices
[37:45] going. But just so you guys can see this
[37:48] one, this is September alone.
[37:51] So what I did was take
[37:54] that chart,
[37:58] paste it along with the description into
[38:00] chat GPT. Please describe to me what
[38:02] this chart shows with DRAM prices and
[38:04] what company should benefit from it.
[38:06] This is how you make money with inside
[38:09] the market. You don't need to pay a
[38:11] analyst. You don't need sellside
[38:13] research and go through all of it. You
[38:15] get a chart like this, you put it in.
[38:18] There's a sudden severe shortage or
[38:19] demand shortage in DRAM memory chips.
[38:22] DDR5 is the backbone of the AI servers,
[38:24] tight supply, blah blah blah. The
[38:26] company's likely to benefit. Well,
[38:28] Samsung, SK, Highex, Micron makes
[38:30] perfect sense. They have an oligopy.
[38:31] We've talked about it. Micron reported,
[38:33] I'll go through that in a second. Uh,
[38:35] but here are the companies on the second
[38:38] order beneficiaries. AMSL is a company
[38:40] that I mentioned last week. You've got
[38:42] token Electron.
[38:44] you start building out and looking at
[38:48] what this shows and what this means and
[38:50] you keep going. So pterodine is a name
[38:55] that came to my attention this week. So
[38:57] as I was doing this I said what about
[38:59] Pterodine? Do they benefit from this
[39:00] move? Yes, Pterodine benefits indirectly
[39:02] from DRAM price surge though with a lag.
[39:05] So near-term 0 to two quarters limited
[39:07] impact medium-term 2 to6 strong memory
[39:10] test demand higher orders for Pterodine.
[39:12] So you start to build as to when they
[39:15] would start to benefit. So it asked me
[39:18] if I wanted a list said, "Yeah, give me
[39:19] a list of the hierarchy and go through
[39:21] the companies at each stage." Okay, so
[39:22] this is the one that's already worked.
[39:24] You can go through these. Micron's up
[39:26] from $60 to $170 as of uh last week
[39:30] before earnings. Uh so what else? What's
[39:33] the next line? Well, here are the next
[39:34] ones in terms of the upstream materials.
[39:36] There's Pterodine sitting at number
[39:38] three in here. You can look at the other
[39:40] names in here. You can go do your own
[39:41] homework.
[39:43] Given Micron has already said there are
[39:45] bottlenecks in supply, does this move
[39:47] the stages up? So what I basically asked
[39:50] the next question was since there's
[39:51] already bottlenecks and since Micron is
[39:53] saying that they've got bottlenecks and
[39:54] delays, what does this mean for
[39:56] Pterodine? What does this mean for all
[39:58] of that supply chain? It pulls
[40:01] everything up, pulls their their benefit
[40:03] forward by one to two quarters. So you
[40:05] should start seeing the demand. So in
[40:08] terms of this, it's moved it up. So that
[40:11] means that these stocks should be seeing
[40:12] more demand. At the same time, it's bad
[40:14] for companies like Nvidia that need it.
[40:16] If there's a bottleneck, they're not
[40:18] able to get their chips done and they'll
[40:20] have delays. So if the supply chain is
[40:23] not there, you want to go with the names
[40:25] that are going to see demand coming from
[40:27] nothing right now. And that's what's
[40:29] happening. A lot of these names like
[40:30] Pterodine, uh like uh ASML, they're kind
[40:34] of unchanged over the last four years.
[40:36] And the reason is because the phones,
[40:38] because the computers, because the
[40:40] autos, because of home, the the sensors
[40:42] in in in washing machines, there's been
[40:45] no demand for this stuff. So now the AI
[40:48] demand is starting to impact them
[40:50] because we're getting into the next
[40:51] stage of this. And it's not just about
[40:55] what Micron said. So what did Micron
[40:57] say? And demand has driven a significant
[40:58] surge in high value data center
[41:00] products, especially bandwidth memory.
[41:01] It's accelerating and industry demand.
[41:03] Supply is tight. attributing the
[41:05] improved forecast directly to AI agent
[41:07] workloads. Again, the job situation and
[41:09] traditional tasks initiated by those
[41:11] agents. The agents are going to
[41:12] accelerate the demand for everything.
[41:14] And what did they say about AI demand
[41:16] for phones and computers? Again, an
[41:18] upgrade cycle is massive for the market.
[41:20] Apple just made new all-time highs.
[41:23] You're starting to see as they release
[41:25] their phone that people are starting to
[41:26] get a little bit more sense that we're
[41:28] getting closer and closer to AI enabled
[41:30] smartphones and AI PCs. He specifically
[41:33] discussed adoption of it as a central
[41:35] growth driver for Micron memory. He
[41:37] cited greater adoption of AIPCs and the
[41:39] end of life for Windows 10. Improving
[41:41] the demand outlook. All smartphones as
[41:43] described by Micron are super companions
[41:45] delivering new multimodal experiences
[41:48] with advanced memory. An improved PC
[41:50] demand outlook is directly tied to
[41:52] increasing sales. In short, Micro
[41:53] Management sees AI adoption in phones
[41:55] and PCs fueling a major upgrade cycle
[41:58] bringing multi-year tailwinds to both
[42:00] DRAM and Nancells. Again, you have a
[42:03] situation that these areas have been in
[42:06] a bare market. So, go find the companies
[42:08] that will benefit as AI gets integrated
[42:11] them, which is what the podcast told
[42:14] you. Then you go through your work in
[42:15] AI. This is how you start from a very
[42:18] high level systems thinking approach.
[42:20] Listen to everything that Jensen Yu Wang
[42:22] said, have AI go through the transcript
[42:25] and then pick out the parts where
[42:26] there's opportunities and then you go
[42:28] through. And if you do this every single
[42:30] day and you go through it, you will
[42:32] start to be using AI in a way that is
[42:34] very easy to do. And by the way, this
[42:36] has been Gemini. This has been ChatCBT.
[42:39] This is Perplexity. Give me a summary of
[42:40] what Susuana said in their upgrade this
[42:42] week. So Susuana upgraded Pterodine.
[42:44] That's how I found Pterodine is because
[42:46] they were up over 10% on Monday when the
[42:49] market was not that strong. So I went
[42:51] through and said, "How can Nvidia be
[42:53] down but this be up? What's going on?
[42:54] And why would the stock be up 10%." So
[42:57] they raised their price target from 133
[42:59] to 200. First of all, it's a big raise.
[43:01] The the main thing here is that I see
[43:04] the reaction of the stock as something
[43:06] very very important. So as I go through
[43:08] analysts pointed out strong exposure to
[43:10] auto, PC and smartphone markets where AI
[43:13] and assisted driving and NPU
[43:15] proliferation are accelerating test
[43:17] demand for new chip families. This is a
[43:19] major thing because this is the the PC.
[43:23] This is the smartphone. The auto is
[43:25] related to robo taxis. Behind that is
[43:29] going to be the brain for humanoids. The
[43:32] note called attention to terterodine's
[43:33] leverage to rising AI hardware demand
[43:35] across autos, PCs, and smartphones
[43:37] sectors that are driving a fresh surge
[43:39] in semiconductor test requirements,
[43:41] especially for advanced. Again, this is
[43:44] how you go find things. All right. Uh,
[43:47] in their most recent earnings
[43:48] commentary, what did they say on NPUs
[43:50] and AI chips? We're seeing a step
[43:51] function increase. Mega trends in
[43:53] automotive, especially
[43:55] assisted driving and infotainment are
[43:57] driving strong demand. As more products
[43:59] integrate AI features, MPUs and neural
[44:02] inferencing, the brain inside the
[44:05] machine, test complexity, and market
[44:06] demand increase. These things are not
[44:09] used yet, guys. This is a new demand
[44:11] side. They're saying it is happening
[44:12] now. I can't I can't say that loud
[44:15] enough. This is a new thing. So, here's
[44:17] the stock. Pterodine was up big on
[44:20] Monday. It continued higher the rest of
[44:21] the week. Again, since March of 2021, it
[44:26] is unchanged. This chart looks like the
[44:29] PMI
[44:31] looks like energy. Again, hardware,
[44:34] hardware, hardware. Uh Trump moves
[44:37] toward a deal for an equity stake in a
[44:40] lithium mine. Again, I'm looking for
[44:42] things that suggest that there is zero
[44:44] chance that the AI bubble is in place.
[44:46] One is all the comments we made that the
[44:48] hyperscalers are in a prisoner's
[44:50] dilemma. They don't have a choice.
[44:52] They'll get their revenues one way or
[44:53] the other. Now, the government has made
[44:55] three investments. One in MP materials,
[44:57] a rare earth company, AI. Now, it's
[45:00] lithium batteries AI. Intel compute AI.
[45:07] Trump signs executive order supporting
[45:08] pros deal to put Tik Tok under US
[45:10] ownership. Uh, again, this is another
[45:12] signal of something I said last week,
[45:13] which I expect. All signals point to the
[45:16] fact that we cannot divorce China. We
[45:19] cannot decouple from China. We depend on
[45:20] the rare earths. We have no choice. So
[45:23] anything where we can find deals with
[45:25] China means the probability of a grand
[45:27] bargain at the Apex Summit increases. If
[45:30] that happens, I went through the
[45:31] beneficiaries last weekend. You can go
[45:33] see them again. Tesla. All right, here
[45:35] we go.
[45:37] Another positive week for Tesla despite
[45:39] the market being down up three and a
[45:42] half%. Uh, I'm going to go through
[45:46] why this is so important. I'm going to
[45:48] take it in more details because we're
[45:50] getting closer and closer to an event.
[45:52] This is Jason from the All-In podcast.
[45:55] My last three Tesla full self-driving
[45:57] rides were absolutely perfect. Alan Mus
[45:59] responds. They're buddies, so not
[46:01] surprising. Version 14 goes into early
[46:05] wide release next week. Then 141 about 2
[46:08] weeks later, and finally 14.2. the car
[46:11] will almost feel like it is sentient
[46:13] being 14.2. So again, I've said this
[46:15] before, check your biases at the door
[46:19] and that includes valuation biases. That
[46:21] includes anything you have with Alon
[46:23] Musk. Tesla is a major story because it
[46:26] is the gateway to humanoids. Humanoids,
[46:29] as I showed you, $50 trillion to $60
[46:32] trillion
[46:34] of spending
[46:36] is on labor. Anything that speeds
[46:39] humanoids up. and you start to get a
[46:41] valuation shift in Tesla. If you're
[46:43] shorted or underweighted, do it at your
[46:46] own risk. This FSD version 14 is
[46:48] important. Please go through the
[46:50] importance of FSD version 14 if it
[46:53] enables the safety driver to be taken
[46:55] out of the car. So people can sit there
[46:57] and say he's still a safety driver.
[46:59] Okay, great. You're in a probability
[47:01] probability distribution. If the safety
[47:03] driver gets taken out, that's the holy
[47:05] grail question. If FSD version 14 or its
[47:09] successors enable safe removal of the
[47:11] safety driver, it would radically change
[47:13] Tesla's valuation operating model and
[47:15] the broader mobility market. So let's
[47:19] just go through this. The economic
[47:20] impact robo taxi revenue model. Instead
[47:22] of selling a Model 3 for 40 50,000 blah
[47:24] blah blah, you get everyone has probably
[47:26] read this at this point. You get a
[47:28] margins jump because utilization goes up
[47:30] dramatically.
[47:32] software monetization, hardware sales,
[47:34] you get all of a sudden a business that
[47:36] completely changes and starts to have
[47:38] somewhat of a similar thing to Apple.
[47:40] I'll go through that as well. So, you're
[47:42] you're looking to see now for humanoid
[47:44] valuation. Given the FSD14 importance of
[47:46] computer vision, if the safety driver is
[47:48] taken out, what does that mean for the
[47:49] possibility of humanoid? I've said this
[47:50] before, they are going with computer
[47:53] vision. Whimo went with geo fencing and
[47:55] lidar.
[47:57] Not only a difference in cost, but
[47:58] again, you drop a Whimo on Mars, it has
[48:01] no idea what to do because it doesn't
[48:02] have GPS. If you drop a computer vision,
[48:05] anything up there, humanoid car to work
[48:08] on Mars, that's the only way it's going
[48:10] to work. That's why this is so
[48:11] important. It will immediately bring the
[48:13] valuation of humanoids into the
[48:15] equation. Even if the scaling of it is
[48:17] not there, because computer vision is
[48:19] one of the three challenges along with
[48:21] scaling and the hand that Musk has
[48:23] mentioned as recently as two weeks ago.
[48:26] FSD's advances in vision-based autonomy
[48:30] are directly transferable to humanoids
[48:32] navigating factories, warehouses, and
[48:33] home. If Tesla can prove cars can drive
[48:35] without humans, cars are just humanoids
[48:37] on wheels, it signals their vision stack
[48:39] is robust enough for realworld
[48:42] uncertainty, a core requirement for
[48:43] humanoids. So, the perception alone
[48:46] could create a valuation of flip way
[48:48] before humanoids generate revenues. That
[48:50] is the argument that I'm making is that
[48:52] if you're going to be short this, pay
[48:54] attention to what he has been signaling.
[48:56] I didn't write a paper on this purely
[48:58] based on some speculation. It was
[49:01] crowdsourcing of information. So much of
[49:04] it, including the stuff on on version
[49:06] 14, including the deal done with Samsung
[49:09] to have his new chips brought in,
[49:11] including the changes in Dojo, including
[49:13] the changes on getting rid of the
[49:15] virtual reality side for training
[49:17] Optimus. So the valuation impact if
[49:20] Tesla shifts from an $800 billion
[49:22] automaker, it's already obviously over a
[49:24] trillion dollars to a multi-trillion
[49:26] dollar AI mobility platform.
[49:29] Why the capitalization of labor will
[49:30] lead to trillions in value?
[49:33] Again, here's the annual spend that can
[49:35] be expected or that is there on
[49:38] mobility. This is the humanoids in terms
[49:40] of the mages. You can go through the TAM
[49:42] for autonomy and humanoids and on your
[49:44] own and figure out what you think it'll
[49:46] be. Investors are already speculating on
[49:49] this. They've been speculating on it.
[49:51] The question is how valuable is that?
[49:53] These are just different things that
[49:55] were put in the practical timeline. 25
[49:58] 26 real driver out pilots. If they
[50:01] believe it's going to happen in 26,
[50:02] they're going to frontload the
[50:03] valuation. So again, I'm doing this more
[50:05] for people who are negative on it and
[50:08] for people who don't have anything on
[50:10] it. For traders that are looking to
[50:12] trade the thing, trade it technically.
[50:14] The charts look great at this point.
[50:15] They don't look like I mean they're
[50:17] still looking good until we get up to
[50:19] the all-time highs. Uh we're approaching
[50:20] it soon. Um since none of this vision is
[50:23] possible without AI, is Tesla an AI
[50:26] company or a car company? I do that
[50:28] because people keep giving me valuations
[50:31] to it. That's not the way to value it.
[50:32] How do you value open AI uh the way it
[50:35] is? And I would say that Tesla has a far
[50:37] bigger advantage than open AI in terms
[50:39] of revenues and the ability of of making
[50:41] the money. And this is where you get
[50:42] through. If you're talking about
[50:43] revenues for the hyperscalers,
[50:46] is Tesla at this point a hyperscaler
[50:48] when XAI is building out Colossus and
[50:50] data centers? And I think the answer is
[50:52] yes. Uh even though it's not the same
[50:54] company, it doesn't really matter. Are
[50:55] they going to get the revenues? And
[50:56] obviously there's a linkage there. The
[50:58] car is a smartphone on wheels. So I just
[51:00] wanted to go through this has been a
[51:02] discussion that has happened and again
[51:04] this is another way the smartphone
[51:06] replaced the PC as the primary computer
[51:08] node. An autonomous AI native car could
[51:11] become the next primary compute
[51:13] environment after the smartphone,
[51:15] especially given one to two hours a day
[51:17] driving. Again, you have to think of
[51:18] this differently. And remember, he's got
[51:21] the hardware, the car, he's got the
[51:22] brain, Grock, the network, Starlink, he
[51:24] just paid for Echoar, the app layer.
[51:30] Just don't fade it. Um, I'm back to this
[51:32] one again.
[51:34] You have to think outside the box.
[51:38] All right. blood bath in crypto this
[51:40] week. Um, so the panic set in not just
[51:42] Bitcoin breaking down below 110, but you
[51:45] have all of these others breaking.
[51:47] Ethereum broke through 4,000. It had
[51:50] been a long road to go from 2500 to
[51:52] 5,000. Now we're back this way. So,
[51:57] a bunch of longs were wiped out. Massive
[52:00] liquidations. Um, here's what I just
[52:02] want to do again because to me the
[52:04] linkage between AI and Bitcoin is is is
[52:09] inexplicably uh it cannot be separated.
[52:12] So I wrote that substack which goes
[52:14] through why I think AI and creative
[52:16] destruction is so important and such a
[52:17] driving force with Bitcoin. We're at the
[52:19] stage now where AI is accelerating to
[52:21] the point where people are going to
[52:22] start losing their jobs. That is exactly
[52:23] the time that the anger starts and where
[52:25] governments are forced to do things like
[52:28] cutting rates. Even if inflation is
[52:30] higher, as gas at the pump goes higher,
[52:32] even if GDP is at 4%. They have to focus
[52:34] on the labor side. They're going to put
[52:36] their own Fed chair in. All of these
[52:38] things are positive for Bitcoin. But the
[52:40] pressure continues to accelerate as AI
[52:43] accelerates. So there's a direct linkage
[52:44] between Bitcoin and Nvidia. And you can
[52:46] see it here. Nvidia. This is the
[52:48] absolute chart, not the regular chart.
[52:51] Whenever Bitcoin or whenever Nvidia is
[52:53] weak, then Bitcoin is weak. Here's the
[52:55] relative trade that's been going on this
[52:57] entire year. They peaked right around
[52:59] the exact same day and then we went
[53:02] down. So again, Nvidia peaks right here
[53:05] on August 8th. Bitcoin peaks right here.
[53:08] They're moving together. Um, every time
[53:11] we've had a correction over since Chat
[53:13] GPT was launched, the white line here is
[53:15] Nvidia versus the S&P. So consolidation
[53:17] here, Bitcoin consolidates. We get this
[53:20] little point here. We get weakness. We
[53:21] get a rally. Then we get another
[53:22] consolidation here. Consolidation here.
[53:24] Then we get this point after a rally,
[53:26] another consolidation. Now we're going
[53:28] through another one. It goes in stair
[53:30] steps. So Nvidia over the S&P is the way
[53:32] to look at this stuff. And again, I
[53:33] reiterate, Nvidia has had plenty of
[53:35] corrections. Bitcoin will always have
[53:37] plenty of corrections as well. But in
[53:39] the end, here's the differential. Um,
[53:41] this is from a uh o sorry, November 2nd.
[53:44] So this is about 3 weeks before the
[53:46] release of Chat GPT. 13 times for
[53:48] Nvidia, five times for Bitcoin. The Mag
[53:52] 7, four times.
[53:55] Gold only 200% and the S&P 500 170.
[54:00] That's it for this week. Uh I appreciate
[54:03] you guys checking in all the subscriber
[54:05] stuff. Um I like seeing a bunch of you
[54:08] uh out on the street trying to help you
[54:10] guys make money. I cannot emphasize it
[54:12] enough. the way I started this. Uh, AI
[54:14] will replace people, but AI is really
[54:17] going to replace people who don't know
[54:19] how to use AI. Keep using it. Keep
[54:22] watching what I'm doing. Try to
[54:23] replicate it. I'll probably be promoting
[54:26] some videos or something to help people
[54:28] more and more. Uh, it's a kind of
[54:30] feeling of being powerless right now
[54:32] with AI coming when the reality is
[54:34] people should be feeling empowered
[54:36] because it allows you to do that. I'll
[54:37] see you next week.
