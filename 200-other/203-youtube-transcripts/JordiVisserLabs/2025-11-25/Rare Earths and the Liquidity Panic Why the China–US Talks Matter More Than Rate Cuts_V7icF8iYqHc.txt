[00:00] Another back and forth week as the rare
[00:02] earth battle continues. A lot of uh
[00:05] public statements made. Uh some news on
[00:08] dark factories in China worth keeping uh
[00:11] in the back of your mind as we get close
[00:13] to humanoid and autonomous vehicle
[00:15] season. Uh go through what happened for
[00:18] the week. We did see the credit fears
[00:22] turn into bank fears as some of them
[00:24] reported. The earnings overall have been
[00:26] great to start off. I'll go through that
[00:28] both on the financials and AI the
[00:30] podcast you guys are going to start
[00:33] hearing more and more about the
[00:34] singularity being near because uh as
[00:37] fast as things are happening in AI and
[00:39] given the fact that it's still
[00:42] filled with bubble uh fears uh the
[00:46] acceleration is coming. So, uh, you
[00:49] don't really have much time to start to
[00:50] get rid of your bubble fears if you want
[00:52] to make alpha. Uh, and the crypto
[00:55] four-year cycle fears seem to be
[00:57] dominating right now. And I'll kind of
[00:59] go through some of that. So, like I
[01:01] said, uh, a lot of back and forth. You
[01:03] know, when we left off last week, uh,
[01:08] Trump had talked about big tariffs and
[01:11] then everything was fine on Sunday,
[01:13] clearly caring about the market. uh that
[01:16] went on all week. You had the Wall
[01:18] Street Journal basically saying uh they
[01:21] want to deescalate, hoping to stabilize
[01:23] the markets. Uh nobody wants the markets
[01:26] to fall in the US. Clearly the
[01:28] administration is trying to walk a line
[01:30] of of being both strong and also
[01:35] recognizing that uh they don't want the
[01:38] market to fall. Trump has basically
[01:39] taken on the market side. Uh Bessant was
[01:42] very aggressive today, very different
[01:44] than uh at the bottom of the market back
[01:46] in April where he became kind of the the
[01:49] person of of reason. Um
[01:52] the tariffs uh
[01:55] they're going to go through they're
[01:56] going to be fasttracked if China
[01:57] escalates the rare earth fight. Um I
[01:59] wouldn't say there was escalation this
[02:01] week if anything aside from just kind of
[02:03] the back and forth. Uh it definitely
[02:06] seems to be everyone sending a message
[02:07] for negotiations.
[02:10] Yeah. JP Morgan saying they're going to
[02:12] plow a trillion half dollars into
[02:14] security industries. The Pentagon
[02:16] stockpiling
[02:18] critical minerals. You had Pakistan in
[02:21] bringing in some rare earth. Um and
[02:24] pretty much now you can finally get
[02:26] podcasts and everything on rare earth.
[02:27] It's taken the entire year uh to get to
[02:30] this point, but the reality is now
[02:32] people are starting to recognize the
[02:34] importance of it. Um the U we had the
[02:36] IMF meetings this week in the World Bank
[02:38] and basically Bessant uh and Greer both
[02:42] said to the world that this has to stop
[02:44] that they're trying to course it. You
[02:46] had a uh a move in from the Dutch taking
[02:50] control of a China owned chip maker. So
[02:52] there's definitely a global sense to
[02:54] this. Now I highlighted Hugh Xiin last
[02:57] week and I just want to make sure that
[02:58] again as you're reading things and
[03:00] you're trying to go through things on
[03:01] both sides. I think continuing to
[03:05] understand there's a couple things in
[03:06] this um this turning point sense of
[03:09] being strangled by the US feel uh feels
[03:12] today from rare earth export controls is
[03:14] exactly like the one China experienced
[03:16] basically everything that keeps coming
[03:17] out from China is that China's trying to
[03:20] stand up to Trump. Uh but I believe
[03:24] China will show full respect for US
[03:26] interests as long as the US is doing the
[03:28] same. And I just want to make sure you
[03:30] you recognize this has been long in the
[03:32] making. So when I started at Morg Morgan
[03:35] Stanley, China's leader was Deng
[03:37] Xiaopang. A decade later, the start of
[03:40] the 1990s saw numerous rare earth
[03:42] milestone events. So again at the start
[03:44] of the 1990s even before the internet uh
[03:48] beginning with the opening of China's
[03:49] national lab for rare earth materials
[03:52] 1991
[03:54] Deng Xiaoing established rare earths as
[03:56] central to China's industrial policy
[03:58] with his ominous quote and possible
[04:00] implied threat of using rare earths as
[04:01] an economic weapon. The Middle East has
[04:03] oil. China has rare earths. Again, this
[04:06] was back in the early 1990s. If you want
[04:10] to go read something on more of a
[04:12] negative side of how this is going to
[04:14] end up and not be an agreement, China's
[04:17] stage two coercion of rare earth rising
[04:19] risks. Um, part of the thing that I
[04:22] think is important to notice, and this
[04:24] goes for two reasons. One is this is the
[04:27] export chart. So, China's exports were
[04:29] released at 8.3% year-over-year.
[04:31] Basically, no different than where
[04:33] they've been the last couple years. And
[04:35] even back in 1718 during Trump back here
[04:38] 8% good good growth number. This white
[04:41] line here is exports to the US down 27%.
[04:44] So there's two things about this. Number
[04:46] one look at this gap. These things have
[04:47] moved together completely over time and
[04:50] all of a sudden now you have this huge
[04:52] gap. China is not exporting anything to
[04:54] the US. It's also not buying soybeans.
[04:57] So on the one side you can understand
[05:00] why transport stops, PMIs, all of this
[05:02] stuff, China not exporting to the US is
[05:05] a big deal. Um
[05:08] it's just it it has implications in
[05:10] terms of all this if we get a trade
[05:12] deal. Anything that involves either
[05:15] keeping tariffs at the lower level or
[05:17] even getting rid of the tariffs if China
[05:19] has the ability of doing that by trading
[05:21] it in for investments. anything along
[05:23] those lines and I think you're going to
[05:25] get a major move in risk assets. I think
[05:28] this is holding up the entire picture.
[05:30] Uh I still believe there's going to be a
[05:33] deal because I don't think China can
[05:35] hold off the rest of the world with rare
[05:36] earth for more than 3 years. And even
[05:39] though that may be a goal, uh I don't
[05:41] think it is unless they're planning war,
[05:45] uh it just doesn't make any sense. So
[05:47] part of the thing is they were up 8.3%
[05:51] just showing that China has the ability
[05:52] to offset falling exports to the US but
[05:54] they're holding rare earth on everyone.
[05:56] So the fact that in the EU they were up
[05:59] 14%.
[06:01] They don't have a strong economy and
[06:03] exports are critical. They don't have a
[06:05] domestic economy right now to handle
[06:06] everything. So I still believe there's
[06:09] going to be a deal. And now when it
[06:11] happens because of what I'm about to
[06:12] show you on everything else that's gone
[06:14] on this week.
[06:16] This is holding a b a ball underwater at
[06:19] this point in terms of earnings, rate
[06:21] cuts, everything. PMI is about to go
[06:23] higher. This evening, Ambassador Greer
[06:25] and Bessant, this is on Friday night at
[06:27] 10:16 p.m. Michael Pettis reposted this.
[06:31] They had frank discussions on the trade
[06:33] relation talks will continue next week
[06:35] ahead of the scheduled. So, as of now,
[06:38] she and Trump are scheduled to meet.
[06:40] Trump spoke in an interview uh with
[06:43] Maria Bard Romo that'll come out uh
[06:46] tomorrow. Well, you guys will see this
[06:48] uh it might be out uh before this uh is
[06:51] released, but I I do record these on
[06:53] Saturday. Uh but he acknowledged that
[06:55] his threat and tariffs on China are not
[06:58] sustainable. He's blaming China, saying
[07:02] he has a good relationship. I think
[07:03] we're going to be fine.
[07:06] And the summit is still on track. I
[07:07] think that's the the main point here. Um
[07:11] the core of the issue according to Trump
[07:12] is securing a fair deal. I think they
[07:14] both want a fair deal. I think I think
[07:16] there's going to be one that happens and
[07:18] again I think there is a lot of upside
[07:20] because the economy right now in terms
[07:22] of earnings in terms of the singularity
[07:24] which is coming massive massive
[07:26] positives and I still believe that
[07:28] people are way too negative in general
[07:30] on AI and see it as a bubble. Still an
[07:33] 80% chance in poly market. We did head
[07:36] down again. and it followed the stock
[07:37] market. Uh so it's moving click for
[07:40] click. This gets into the dark
[07:42] factories. Western executives who visit
[07:45] China are coming back terrified.
[07:46] Robotics has catapulted Beijing into a
[07:49] dominant position. These are not jokes.
[07:51] These are not me any
[07:57] Ford seat era. There are no people.
[08:00] Everything is robotic. It's the most
[08:01] humbling thing I've ever seen.
[08:05] Executives describe touring facilities
[08:06] in China where robots do much of the
[08:08] work that there are few or no operators
[08:11] so-called dark factories that run
[08:13] without lights. We are in a global
[08:15] competition with China and it's not just
[08:17] EVs. If we lose this, we do not have a
[08:20] future at Ford
[08:23] again. Humanoids is becoming part of it.
[08:26] Andre Horowits, America cannot lose the
[08:29] robotics race. Entirely autonomous dark
[08:32] factories like those of smartphone
[08:33] automobile manufacturer Xiaomi operate
[08:36] in complete darkness with no humans
[08:38] present. China is running away with the
[08:41] hard power side of AI. I bring all this
[08:44] up. I'm still going to do a lot on
[08:47] Tesla, but Thursday, November 6th,
[08:51] you have Elon Musk shareholder meeting.
[08:53] Remember he signed this massive package
[08:55] and there's speculation that Optimus 3
[08:58] will be shown. Remember what the release
[09:00] of the smartphone was in terms of Steve
[09:02] Jobs showing it. At some point here with
[09:04] Musk, we are going to see humanoids
[09:08] displayed in a way which is going to
[09:09] change the investment environment
[09:11] forever. Not for a day, not for a week.
[09:14] The iPhone changed and created the Mag
[09:17] 7. People need to start to get ready for
[09:20] this. Autonomous vehicles is one side.
[09:22] I've talked about Tesla. I've written
[09:24] about it and people are not paying
[09:26] attention. Elon Musk says the biggest
[09:28] ROI from AI will be human humanoid
[09:31] robots. China's EV exec says China roll
[09:33] out of Tesla's self-driving tech is a
[09:35] deepseek moment for autonomous vehicles.
[09:38] China thought they were ahead in
[09:40] everything relating to EVs and
[09:42] autonomous vehicles. They dominate where
[09:45] over 60% of all the cars released in
[09:47] China have autonomous capabilities and
[09:51] they went up for a test had 36 cars.
[09:53] Tesla won. Tesla escaped the test
[09:55] relatively unscathed. This was back in
[09:58] the summertime. The secret fuel powering
[10:00] China's self-driving cars. Is there lack
[10:02] of regulation? Uh I don't think it's a
[10:05] coincidence that the US is basically
[10:07] again starting to come off of some of
[10:10] the tariffs to help the parts of the
[10:12] economy that need it, which are soft,
[10:14] including the auto market. So for the
[10:15] week, S&P up 1.7% despite the back and
[10:18] forth. Q's up 2.5%.
[10:23] Uh IWM up 2.4. All of these are the best
[10:27] performance in a week since August. Uh
[10:29] so even though September was a good
[10:31] month, good week for for stocks.
[10:35] Semiconductors, semiconductors,
[10:37] semiconductors. I keep saying compute,
[10:39] compute, compute.
[10:41] Do not pay attention to the charts. Pay
[10:43] attention to how big the demand is and
[10:46] how massively massively behind we are on
[10:50] compute. So when you hear bubble talk,
[10:53] go by semiconductors. Semiconductors
[10:55] were up another 5.4%.
[10:57] This was, believe it or not, the biggest
[10:59] rally since the end of June.
[11:02] I wrote this paper on the fra fragile
[11:04] immune system. This had two purposes.
[11:06] One is just to highlight that I think
[11:07] for the next two weeks because we have
[11:09] the back and forth on China and the US.
[11:11] So don't be surprised if we get more
[11:13] negotiation
[11:15] uh ups and downs. You also have the
[11:17] earnings from the MAG 7 in there. uh and
[11:19] you've had all of the the credit risk,
[11:21] but also you have the blackouts for
[11:23] buybacks. You have a bunch of things
[11:25] going on. Um but also, this was meant to
[11:28] just highlight that every now and then
[11:29] we're going to get these VAR shocks. The
[11:31] VIX went from 16 to 29. Um I talked
[11:35] about it that I think VIX calls are
[11:37] always a way to play a concentrated
[11:39] market like this. We're going to have a
[11:41] lot of episodic falls because there's
[11:43] very few names that are running. Uh, and
[11:45] I think you're gonna have that where
[11:47] some names are going to be tripling in a
[11:49] year and a lot of names like Ford are
[11:51] going to be range trading for the next
[11:52] five years while they go out of
[11:53] business. Um, I tweeted this. If you
[11:56] haven't been following my post, I am
[11:58] starting to post more just with things
[12:00] that are happening during the week and
[12:01] things that are going on because more
[12:02] and more people are requesting more
[12:04] videos. I'm not going to do any more
[12:05] videos. This is going to be the only
[12:07] one. Uh, I will start recording some
[12:09] stuff for helping people learn AI. uh
[12:12] getting them some other things to
[12:14] hopefully get them the ability to
[12:16] follow markets this way. Um go from
[12:18] podcast to ideas. Uh know which names to
[12:21] go through. I do want to create some
[12:23] videos on this. I'm just trying to put
[12:24] it together with 22V. Uh regional banks,
[12:27] the regional bank ETF down huge one day
[12:30] this week. Uh aside from SVB and aside
[12:34] from liberation day was a big move lower
[12:37] as the fears were spreading. Jamie
[12:39] Diamond said there's not ever one
[12:42] cockroach. Um, but we also have
[12:44] liquidity issues that were popping up.
[12:46] This got X all lit up. Uh, you had Sofur
[12:50] verse Fed funds uh ticking higher uh in
[12:53] a way that suggests that the market is
[12:56] strained for liquidity, which is true.
[12:57] Um, the Fed's uh standing repo facility,
[13:01] someone tapped it for one of the largest
[13:04] things since CO uh you have a you have a
[13:07] liquidity issue. um that shouldn't be a
[13:10] surprise at this. It's been known. Uh
[13:12] I'm just going to highlight this as my
[13:13] move, my face. Uh the breath with inside
[13:16] the bond market, the corporate bond
[13:18] market also showed the weakness this
[13:19] week. Um we do have liquidity issues,
[13:22] but that's why the Fed and Pal said that
[13:24] QT is is probably going to be stopped
[13:26] sooner uh very soon at this point, maybe
[13:28] at the next meeting. Um the VIX did get
[13:31] up like I said up towards 29 which
[13:34] basically put it at you know the highest
[13:36] level since just kind of the weeks
[13:38] after. So you had a big move as I
[13:40] mentioned CTAs are modeled to sell over
[13:43] every scenario. They've clearly been
[13:45] selling at this point the buyback window
[13:47] as I mentioned you've also got
[13:48] systematic V strategies which need to
[13:50] sell. Um but once we get out of this
[13:52] point that's fine. Now, I also did
[13:54] highlight that we've seen this Goldman
[13:56] Sachs uh crowded long versus crowded
[13:59] short, which is the white line index
[14:01] trade lower. Now, I overlaid this
[14:03] because it's been moving with quality.
[14:05] So, this is the Morgan Stanley quality
[14:07] basket. This is long, high quality,
[14:10] short, lowquality. So, it's been the
[14:12] garbage things or the junky names that
[14:14] have been causing the pain. Now, this
[14:16] white line here is the crowded shorts
[14:20] relative to the S&P. That's the white
[14:22] line. So, it's had a big move. This is
[14:25] IWM over the SPY, which has bottomed
[14:28] since August and gone higher. This green
[14:31] line here is the PMI. If the PMI does go
[14:34] higher, as I believe it absolutely will,
[14:36] and head up towards 60 next year, I do
[14:39] believe that you will continue to see a
[14:41] lot of the junky names rally, a lot of
[14:43] stuff go. If you have the combination of
[14:45] this cutting two more times, I think
[14:48] people underestimate the importance that
[14:49] makes for earnings for smaller cap
[14:51] businesses, which obviously depend a lot
[14:53] on on rates. So rates moving lower and
[14:57] at the same time, you're getting blowout
[14:59] earnings. So far, we're about 10% into
[15:01] the season and we're getting strong
[15:04] sales growth and we're getting strong
[15:07] earnings growth and technology doing
[15:10] what it always does, but you've got
[15:11] financials and you had a big week for
[15:13] Goldman and for Morgan and for all
[15:15] these. And you can look and see what the
[15:17] surprises were for each of these names.
[15:19] Just to run across the board, just look
[15:21] how many of them were at least 2%
[15:23] surprises on the sales side and then
[15:25] where we had on the earnings side. So
[15:27] the earnings have been great. Capex for
[15:30] next year is going to be massive and
[15:32] it's going to be massive. Why fade this?
[15:37] Why fade the numbers coming through when
[15:39] it comes to the stock market? These
[15:40] impact the earnings. They impact
[15:43] everything going on at the uh at the
[15:45] economy level. But that's not the only
[15:47] thing that's happening. Now if you want
[15:48] to be short the mag 7, I don't have a
[15:50] problem with the spenders. The spenders
[15:51] are starting to act
[15:54] weak. So this white line here is an
[15:56] equal weight of the hyperscalers the
[15:58] four you know big boys the Amazon Google
[16:02] Meta uh and whatever one Microsoft I'm
[16:05] forgetting they're unchanged basically
[16:07] since mid August they're overlaid here
[16:09] with what they're spending on we finally
[16:12] have seen a divergence so the semis are
[16:14] all the way up here and this is on the
[16:15] same sc uh the the same scale so semis
[16:18] are up 41% but all of that
[16:20] outperformance came since September so
[16:23] you're starting finally to get the break
[16:26] and I think this is where the issue is
[16:27] and what I've said to people that I've
[16:28] met with and gone through and if anyone
[16:30] wants to see a presentation on this
[16:32] beginning at the iPhone we had these
[16:34] companies the mega cap 8 massively grow
[16:39] their price to sales have just continued
[16:41] to go higher this to me is basically
[16:43] modern-day debt to equity so if you want
[16:46] to find how leveraged a company is it's
[16:48] really in their multiple so if they're
[16:50] spending t tons of money they need the
[16:52] sales to come through this is what
[16:53] everyone's compl complaining about. I
[16:55] don't know if they're going to get the
[16:56] sales. I don't think all of them will. I
[16:58] think some of them are going to be in
[16:59] trouble in terms of the spending. It
[17:01] doesn't mean they're going to collapse
[17:02] because this isn't debt, but their
[17:04] multiples will contract over time. And
[17:05] that can happen by the S&P going higher
[17:07] and them going sideways regard which is
[17:09] what's been happening since the summer.
[17:11] Regardless, their earnings are coming up
[17:13] soon. If they can't show that they're
[17:15] making money, they're going to have
[17:16] trouble. Here's the chart again, but
[17:18] this time I included the one that I
[17:19] think is going to outperform
[17:20] dramatically. And since the majority of
[17:22] you, whether you're a hedge fund or a
[17:24] mutual fund, don't believe in Alon Musk,
[17:28] prepare
[17:29] for danger next year.
[17:33] I believe it's a bubble. Blah blah blah.
[17:35] I This just goes on. It's actually
[17:37] boring. I will feed everyone some bubble
[17:40] food, though. Um there are plenty of
[17:43] stocks with inside the energy space.
[17:45] Nuclear, um all of this, they're just
[17:48] Momo names with no earnings. and I don't
[17:50] know if they're ever going to make any
[17:52] big amounts of money. So, there's plenty
[17:54] of froth with inside this and I think
[17:56] retail's been having fun with it and I
[17:59] think they should trade the momentum.
[18:00] They seem to be very good at it, but I
[18:02] think that is an area that is a bubble.
[18:04] I just don't think the market and what's
[18:05] going on especially for semiconductors
[18:07] and the spend fading the spend is a
[18:09] mistake. AI is far far ahead of the
[18:12] supply as I'm going to continue to go
[18:14] through. We had these four companies
[18:16] TSM, ASML, Applied Digital, SKH Highex,
[18:19] all in different parts of business lines
[18:21] related to it. You got memory, you've
[18:23] got lithography, you obviously have the
[18:25] FABS, and then you've got more on the
[18:28] real estate and energy side. So you've
[18:29] got a really big broad thing and they
[18:32] all blew away numbers applied uh digital
[18:37] and I'll spend time on this one mainly
[18:38] because this is the type of thing that
[18:40] if you fade your when you look at Micron
[18:43] and it's gone from 60 to 200 and I've
[18:46] talked about in this podcast the entire
[18:48] year applied digital describe the
[18:50] current environment as the AI revolution
[18:51] hyperscalers are anticipated to invest
[18:53] around 350 billion this year which is
[18:56] basically what I just showed you going
[18:57] up to 450 50 plus next year if not 500
[19:02] we have sell see ourselves well
[19:03] positioned their revenue surged 84%
[19:07] year-over-year
[19:09] not surprising that this is what their
[19:10] stock has done so if you fade this
[19:13] you're fading literally something that
[19:15] was trading near lows
[19:18] at the beginning
[19:20] or right after uh the lows and then we
[19:24] were still sitting at $7 now at 34 as
[19:27] you entered the summertime time. It is a
[19:30] huge mistake to call AI a bubble and
[19:32] cost yourself alpha if you're waiting to
[19:35] try and play this on the short side,
[19:37] which I know very few are because they
[19:38] would have already been knocked out.
[19:40] These are just words just like
[19:41] stagflation and hyperinflation and
[19:44] shorting bonds and every other stupid
[19:46] word we've heard all year. The reality
[19:48] is there's tons of money to be made on
[19:50] these, but these charts are hard to buy
[19:52] because they're straight up. As someone
[19:54] told me at one of the asset managers, it
[19:56] takes courage to buy a chart like that.
[19:58] I completely agree. My only thing here
[20:00] is I'll show you the bottlenecks and the
[20:02] things that can slow this down, but AI
[20:05] is far ahead of everything that you're
[20:07] seeing. Samsung, SK, all of that.
[20:10] They're way ahead of it. We're not even
[20:12] close. So, the summary is the demand is
[20:15] deep.
[20:16] It's not just shallow hype. And you guys
[20:18] can read all of this on your own, but
[20:20] basically across the board, when you
[20:22] take five companies like that that
[20:23] reported this week, that's what you get.
[20:25] So, if people have the view that it's a
[20:27] a bubble, and I've I've shown Harris
[20:30] Co's piece uh on uh it back in August, a
[20:34] blog post that he did on the
[20:36] hyperscalers and the difficulties in
[20:38] them reaching their spending, which I
[20:39] agree with. What I don't agree with is
[20:41] the argument that the market won't reach
[20:44] the spending. You can make the argument
[20:45] that Microsoft won't get it, that they
[20:47] won't get it, but to argue that AI is
[20:50] not going to bring in trillions of
[20:51] dollars of revenues to me is ridiculous.
[20:54] And I've heard people say, and I won't
[20:55] get through who, that it's only brought
[20:57] in 20 billion this year, which is just
[21:00] wrong. Wrong beyond belief in terms of
[21:03] adding up the hyperscalers reist. We're
[21:05] well over 100 billion, way past it. And
[21:08] then when you add in the benefits that
[21:10] come on the productivity lift, and
[21:12] that's what Matt Matthew Seagull's going
[21:13] through. But when you get these bubble
[21:15] pieces, find someone who's on the other
[21:18] side or just bring it into Chat GPT as I
[21:21] did and say, "Hey, go through the two
[21:22] arguments and be the judge. Tell me who
[21:24] wins." Matthew Seagull's argument is
[21:26] more accurate.
[21:28] Matthew Seagull's argument is more
[21:29] robust because it's grounded in
[21:31] immediate tangible benefits of
[21:32] operational efficiencies. You don't have
[21:34] to sit there and worry about them. I get
[21:36] sent these every day. Most of these are
[21:39] clickbait. If they have a lot of
[21:41] followers and X, it's meant for
[21:42] clickbait. Honestly, it is. People might
[21:45] believe it, but they're not sitting out
[21:47] there shorting. And if they would, they
[21:48] wouldn't be going through it. So, a lot
[21:50] of this is just people kind of going
[21:51] through and and and and putting out
[21:53] there what they want. And for media
[21:55] people, it's clickbait. I'd be putting
[21:57] bubble stuff, too. In fact, go to my
[21:59] videos. How many times do I include
[22:00] bubble in the title? It gets more views.
[22:02] I hate to say it, but that's the truth.
[22:04] That's what people search for. People
[22:05] are fairly negative. So, it's an easy
[22:07] way to drive revenue to you if that's
[22:09] what you're doing. Um, best podcast of
[22:11] the week, Dave Blondon, who you've
[22:13] probably heard if you've listened to the
[22:14] Moonshot podcast, very level-headed guy,
[22:17] been at MIT uh, in some form since the
[22:20] early 1980s, working initially for
[22:22] Marvin Minsky. Um, worth listening to
[22:25] this. Some explosive things in here. He
[22:28] doesn't get a chance to talk about this
[22:29] on Moonshots as much, but he's very
[22:32] levelheaded and went through a bunch of
[22:34] things that to me are important. Two
[22:36] versions of AI progress happening at
[22:37] once. Uh this is the most important
[22:39] thing of everything I'm doing this week
[22:41] is for you to understand there's the
[22:43] public facing models. These are the ones
[22:45] that we use, I use, you use. Whether
[22:47] it's GPT4, GPT5, doesn't really matter.
[22:51] These are stable, heavily tested and
[22:54] cost optimized and they're still
[22:56] constrained by compute and safety
[22:58] filters. These are released. These are
[23:00] not the models that they're using behind
[23:02] the scenes internally. Non-public
[23:05] research models are further ahead.
[23:08] They're used for self-training,
[23:09] architecture, exploration, and automated
[23:11] improvement. The reason this is
[23:14] important is he talks about how he was
[23:16] there this summer. He understands is
[23:19] he's been in AI since 1980. He had a
[23:22] unicorn in the dot bubble. Recursive
[23:25] self-improvement, which I've highlighted
[23:27] before, is the step before the
[23:29] inflection point, which means before
[23:31] AGI. We train models manually with human
[23:34] data. Models begin training themselves.
[23:38] That is the critical transition. When we
[23:40] move from LLM as software, LLM as
[23:42] researcher when they're doing the work,
[23:45] Marvin Minsky, Demisaba, Sam Alman had
[23:48] viewed this as the takeoff point towards
[23:50] artificial general intelligence.
[23:53] Everything I'm going to show you from
[23:54] here for the rest of this video is about
[23:57] the fact that we are there. from
[23:59] everyone behind the scenes they're
[24:01] saying we are at recursive already
[24:04] self-improvement it's not to the point
[24:06] of AGI but it's the takeoff point which
[24:09] means from here the compounding that's
[24:11] been happening you have to ignore the
[24:13] models for everyone who call say the
[24:15] models don't do anything that's already
[24:17] BS but to say that you know what they're
[24:20] going to be able to do is just not there
[24:22] the weakness is
[24:25] compute so you have to think the models
[24:27] they have are incredibly compute
[24:30] inensive. That's why when they release
[24:32] V3 or Sora 2, you get to use it for no
[24:35] more than 15 seconds. Vo3.1 is coming
[24:38] out soon. It doesn't really matter.
[24:41] They're seeing real progress internally
[24:43] that isn't yet deployable.
[24:46] He's talking like I said a lot of
[24:48] internal compute resources were diverted
[24:50] towards recursive self-improvement.
[24:52] Everyone that I know that uses chatpt in
[24:54] the manner that I do and to the extent
[24:57] has said that it's very obvious that
[24:59] chatpt is restricting now the usage.
[25:02] They've done everything they can to slow
[25:04] it down. Compute is their backlog. They
[25:07] have research product ideas they'd like
[25:09] to run but they are blocked by
[25:11] insufficient computing hardware test
[25:13] capacity. They have products further
[25:15] ahead than the ones they're already
[25:17] making billions of dollars on. ones that
[25:20] will help with cancer, ones that will
[25:22] help with things that will blow your
[25:24] mind. The problem is they don't have
[25:26] enough compute. So go buy your
[25:28] semiconductors even at this. If they're
[25:30] not really expensive for next year's
[25:32] earnings,
[25:34] they're not expensive.
[25:36] Sam Alman's comments on capacity
[25:38] overhang. So remember, I highlighted
[25:41] this last week. Sam Alman said this on a
[25:43] podcast. You will not hear this from
[25:45] Goldman Sachs. You will not hear this
[25:46] from Morgan Stanley. they will not get
[25:48] Sam Alman and he won't be allowed to say
[25:50] this. We have better models than we've
[25:51] released. When you listen to an
[25:53] interview and it's just going, there are
[25:55] so many nuances and nuggets that that's
[25:57] where your information is coming from.
[25:58] If you're reading research from a
[26:00] salesside analyst who happens to be in
[26:02] their 30s, 40s, 50s, unless they're
[26:04] spending all of their time listening to
[26:06] podcast, they're not. They're spending
[26:08] their time talking about AI bubbles all
[26:10] day long. Trust me, because I refuse to
[26:12] do that, but that's what's going on. He
[26:15] described the capacity overhang of
[26:17] having these models broadly due to the
[26:19] limits in GPU and accelerator
[26:20] availability. High bandwidth memory,
[26:22] data center power, cooling, and network.
[26:24] That's what you invest in. That's the
[26:26] stuff creating the alpha. Hearing
[26:29] multiple independent whispers that
[26:31] OpenAI just had a breakthrough too big
[26:33] to announce casually something emergent.
[26:35] People inside calling it phase two,
[26:37] others saying level four.
[26:39] out of Google this week. We're doing all
[26:42] kinds of stuff with these models that
[26:44] the public isn't even thinking of yet.
[26:46] Pay attention people. He's a top
[26:48] researcher at Google Deep Mind. After
[26:50] all, attention is all you need. Yet, it
[26:52] seems to be severely lacking.
[26:56] Um, so OpenAI does all these deals and
[26:59] you're wondering how they're doing these
[27:00] deals when all they have is Chat GPT and
[27:02] 1620 billion of of annualized revenue. I
[27:06] have a feeling all of these guys, or at
[27:08] least the ones that they did deals with
[27:10] here, have seen what they're able to do.
[27:13] They're securing the compute that they
[27:15] say they need for the models they've
[27:16] already built and trained. They just
[27:18] don't have enough to release them to the
[27:20] outside world, and they don't have
[27:22] enough to continue to drive them. That's
[27:23] why they want all of this. It's not some
[27:25] investment that isn't happening now.
[27:28] They just can't release it for demand.
[27:30] So, use your brain. Think about what
[27:32] that means. And then when you hear
[27:34] someone say it's a bubble, they're not
[27:36] making any money. When something is
[27:38] moving exponentially, today is always
[27:41] yesterday. Keep that in the back of your
[27:44] mind. Especially when the models are
[27:45] talking about are at least 6 months
[27:49] ahead to a year in terms of what they
[27:51] can do and then go through the
[27:53] compounding and read what Alon Mus has
[27:55] said. Read what any of them said.
[27:58] Alman's capacity overstamp isn't a
[28:00] warning. It's a road map. Bottlenecks
[28:02] drive vertical integration. So because
[28:04] of the bottlenecks, he's literally
[28:06] trying to buy everything he can to
[28:08] ensure that the value he has inside the
[28:11] walls, he's able to actually do.
[28:15] That's the problem. He thinks he has
[28:17] everything. He thinks he has AGI. Dave
[28:20] Blondon, when asked, "When do you think
[28:23] AGI happens?" 20 26 to 27 for AGI
[28:27] strongly implied to rest on the belief
[28:29] that of recursive self-improvement.
[28:31] Again, recursive self-improvement. Go
[28:33] listen to what Eric Schmidt has said
[28:35] about it. He's basically saying it's
[28:37] there. So is Alex from Moonshots has
[28:40] been saying that repeatedly. So has
[28:41] Ahmad Musto. All of them have said it
[28:44] and they're involved. They're all AI
[28:46] people,
[28:48] not some hedge fund guy saying it's a
[28:50] bubble with absolutely no knowledge of
[28:51] AI and doesn't use it. So every time
[28:53] people send me these papers, I literally
[28:55] just can't deal with the stuff that
[28:57] comes with it. Today's forecast reflects
[28:59] not a gradual scaling, but an inflection
[29:01] point where recursive learning kicks in.
[29:02] You may see an acceleration that's much
[29:04] steeper than the prior annual gains.
[29:07] Again, if that's the case, you can
[29:09] expect to see unbelievable things
[29:11] happening this year. A recursive loop
[29:13] only works if computers abundant enough
[29:15] to run multiple internal training
[29:16] cycles. So it basically comes down to
[29:18] compute. If you want to slow AI down, it
[29:20] comes down to things like rare earth. It
[29:22] comes down to things like uh power, all
[29:24] of those things. MIT just released a
[29:26] paper this week that it can write its
[29:28] own code. Again, getting into the
[29:30] self-learning side, memory cycle. I
[29:33] talked about how I could not believe
[29:35] that experts were saying that we were
[29:37] going to have a memory supply over
[29:39] supply next year. Again, we just heard
[29:42] the demand is further ahead than what's
[29:43] actually going on. And it's all
[29:45] inference. So, this paper was just on
[29:48] the memory super cycle and the demand
[29:51] side. Memory demand of large AI models
[29:52] topic of concern. Uh in the past large
[29:56] language models training was the core
[29:58] driving force behind the demand for the
[30:00] entire AI infrastructure. But now
[30:01] inference workloads are rapidly becoming
[30:03] the dominant force. If you go into this
[30:06] paper again and you can find these just
[30:09] through X through podcast. I don't even
[30:12] remember by the end of the week where I
[30:13] got all this stuff. Um, that's how much
[30:16] it's just kind of a constant thing for
[30:18] me to go learn about what's going on and
[30:20] read about it so I can not only talk
[30:22] about it, so I understand it, so I can
[30:23] make money off it personally, so I can
[30:25] invest in Bitcoin, which I believe is
[30:26] the perfect trade on this. Um, I want to
[30:28] make sure that this is going and I'm not
[30:30] missing something. I want to make sure
[30:31] the China US thing is going to happen.
[30:32] The next semiconductor upcycle will be
[30:34] driven not by model trading, but by
[30:35] inference. Every chat GPT style
[30:37] inference keeps data constantly moving,
[30:39] creating a long duration memory cycle.
[30:41] It's 24/7. the explosion of inference
[30:44] workloads and edge deployments. And
[30:45] again, edge deployments when we start
[30:47] getting our phones, our computers,
[30:48] humanoids, autonomous vehicles, all of
[30:50] that is on the edge, meaning the brain
[30:51] is now inside the device, not coming
[30:53] from the cloud. We need more and more
[30:55] memory. This is not cyclical. This is
[30:58] structural. It is a super cycle that
[31:00] could persist through 2027.
[31:03] Keep that in mind. 2728 is the point
[31:06] where everyone is kind of thinking that
[31:09] we will have enough data center
[31:10] capacity, we'll have enough compute,
[31:12] blah blah blah. So let's just keep
[31:13] focusing that we have another year maybe
[31:16] year and a half of investing in this and
[31:18] we'll see where it is next year. So for
[31:21] all of the capacity overhang you can go
[31:23] look at the core issues go down here a
[31:26] lot of money to be made on this. Um both
[31:29] converge on a single thesis the AI
[31:31] bottleneck is physical infrastructure
[31:33] it's not the demand side it is literally
[31:36] this thing. So, all of these companies
[31:38] in here benefit from all of these
[31:41] different components that are necessary
[31:43] to be able to meet Sam's needs. He's
[31:46] been buying things within all of these
[31:48] or making deals with inside all of these
[31:50] in some way, shape, or fashion. The
[31:52] All-In podcast had Brad Gersner on, made
[31:56] it worthwhile completely for me to
[31:58] listen to the whole thing, but they also
[31:59] covered in a bunch of important topics
[32:00] that I think are worthwhile for you
[32:02] guys. They went through the OpenAI AM uh
[32:05] AMD deal since people freak out about
[32:07] these things all the time. Also, this
[32:08] round tripping concern, they talk about
[32:10] that, but they also go through the
[32:11] demand and efficiency. No dark GPUs,
[32:15] which again means that we don't have a
[32:17] we have a demand. We have a supply
[32:19] issue. We don't have a demand problem
[32:21] because every GPU is being used. So,
[32:23] when I hear people say, well, these are
[32:24] going to be out of date in a few years.
[32:26] We're using everything that's available.
[32:28] There's nothing that's not being used
[32:30] and we have demand for more. So even if
[32:33] it means we're using older ones, we're
[32:34] still using them. So there's no data
[32:36] centers that are going to be turned off
[32:38] as I heard someone say in the next 3
[32:40] years just because they have chips from
[32:42] Nvidia. Um they went through the TAM and
[32:46] talked about how big it would be. So
[32:47] again, when you're getting into what
[32:48] Matt Seagull was debating, you can go
[32:51] get trillions of dollars. They talk
[32:52] about it. I I these guys again are
[32:55] experts with inside the field. If you
[32:57] listen to 50 people and they don't have
[32:59] a vested interest completely across the
[33:01] board, they're just speaking. Um, one
[33:03] thing that's important and I just want
[33:04] to bring this up because Nvidia, um, you
[33:07] know, I've tried to find ways to be
[33:09] negative on it, but the more I've heard
[33:11] everyone speak about it, include Jensen,
[33:13] this has become an issue where its moat
[33:16] is the fact that it isn't a chip, it is
[33:19] an AI factory, and that's because of all
[33:21] of the component pieces. They've secured
[33:23] the high bandwidth memory packaging. I
[33:25] just showed you the memory issue. They
[33:27] continue to make progress in terms of
[33:30] what Brad Gersonner says is the most
[33:32] important thing which is doing things in
[33:35] performance performance per watt. That's
[33:38] the way everything is being measured now
[33:40] is system level perform performance per
[33:44] watt. And that means that it's the
[33:46] efficiency thing that everyone was
[33:47] worried about with invi with DeepSeek.
[33:50] These are the guys winning that battle
[33:51] in terms of the efficiency. So Brad
[33:54] emphasized that Nvidia strength lies not
[33:55] merely in raw chip count but in how much
[33:57] useful computation you can get per watt
[34:00] of power. If computation is the issue
[34:03] and power is the issue that's what
[34:04] matters. Can I get performance from it?
[34:06] So,
[34:08] uh,
[34:10] did they bring up if competitors try
[34:11] another approach that they are taking a
[34:13] big risk on unproven commodity? And yes,
[34:16] if someone decides they're going to try
[34:17] to not use Nvidia to build a data
[34:20] center, they're taking risk on something
[34:23] that hasn't been done at this size
[34:25] before. When your customers deploy a
[34:27] gigawatt, that's 400 or 500,000 GPUs.
[34:30] Getting 500,000 GPUs to work together is
[34:33] a miracle. What customer would place a
[34:35] 50 billion purchase order on an unproven
[34:38] architecture? That is why they have a
[34:40] moat. So you can continue to watch
[34:42] Nvidia as as the the story for chips.
[34:46] they may not make as much at this point
[34:49] because they are big and so the dollars
[34:51] that they're going and how much they can
[34:53] produce maybe they can't produce as much
[34:54] as they need and you're better off
[34:56] looking at the other places that I
[34:58] mentioned in in here in terms of the
[35:00] names which are just starting to go plus
[35:02] the names that are going to benefit from
[35:04] the edge side and the NPU side but the
[35:07] these are the issues that show up in
[35:09] terms of this one of the ones that's
[35:11] starting to come up which and you can
[35:12] see rare earth here these are the things
[35:14] that can stop it this one is becoming a
[35:16] much bigger issue. The last two weeks
[35:17] I've debated to kind of spend a lot of
[35:19] time on it. I will bring it up here, but
[35:22] state regulation is becoming an issue
[35:25] for AI and it could slow it down.
[35:28] There's a lot of different things. Uh
[35:30] Colorado's already put something out
[35:31] which is they they've done um Anthropic
[35:35] got David Saxs going at them this week
[35:38] in terms of them saying doom and gloom
[35:39] stuff. But the reality is the midterm
[35:42] elections are coming up and AI is going
[35:43] to be a dominant part of the midterm
[35:45] elections. Both from the jobless growth,
[35:47] GDP up, hiring down. I think this is
[35:49] going to be a major major story. I
[35:51] expect the GDP to be great and I expect
[35:53] the hiring again to be near zero. And
[35:56] I'm going to bring this up further in
[35:58] episodes. I had a lot of people call up
[35:59] and say, "Isn't the hiring all about the
[36:02] lower participation due to the fact that
[36:05] immigration?" Just remember guys, there
[36:07] is a big difference between the monthly
[36:10] labor numbers and the sentiment that's
[36:12] coming from the conference board, that's
[36:14] coming from temp hiring, that's coming
[36:16] from every single uh thing that shows
[36:19] the hiring market is soft. So this is
[36:22] not a supply issue only in terms of the
[36:26] numbers. There is definitely fear of
[36:29] employees right now from AI and
[36:31] businesses are not hiring the way that
[36:33] they used to. The economy is showing
[36:35] signs of weakness if first brands and
[36:38] the defaults that we've seen that are
[36:39] fraud. There's going to be more of these
[36:42] because companies are not. It's a
[36:44] K-shaped economy. You're going to have
[36:45] more of these. The electricity costs are
[36:47] going to go up. You're going to have the
[36:48] fake viral videos which will be part of
[36:50] it. Big money to shape regulations. So
[36:53] again, I think the elections are going
[36:55] to be big on this. Uh this week's where
[36:58] are the jobs going to go and what's
[36:59] going to happen. Um these guys wrote an
[37:02] article. They're from a a a company uh
[37:06] mechanization
[37:08] mechanization. Um but just type in the
[37:11] future of AI is already written. It's a
[37:12] good report. It just goes through the
[37:15] fact that autonomous agents that are
[37:16] fully substitute for human label willy
[37:19] be created because they will provide
[37:20] immense utility that where AI tools
[37:22] cannot. The main thing I want to bring
[37:24] this up on this is that their focus is
[37:26] the fact that even if people wanted to
[37:29] stop AI from impacting jobs, it can't
[37:32] happen. And the reason is capitalism and
[37:35] public companies need to focus on
[37:37] shareholder wealth. So that has been the
[37:40] story of US equities for a long time is
[37:43] to find a way. That is why when
[37:45] companies announce that they are firing
[37:47] lots of people, generally the stock goes
[37:48] up because their expenses went down and
[37:51] so their net earnings by definition
[37:54] unless their revenues fall equally as
[37:56] much. It's generally thought of as a
[37:58] good thing. The problem is
[38:03] argues economics in economic incentives
[38:06] not moral choice drive technological
[38:08] direction. It states that autonomous
[38:09] agents that fully substitute for human
[38:11] labor will inevitably be created because
[38:14] they provide immense utility and that
[38:16] humanity is more like a roaring stream
[38:18] following the path of least resistance.
[38:20] This logic mirrors the US focus on
[38:22] shareholder value maximization. When
[38:24] capital is rewarded for efficiency and
[38:26] profit, the path of least resistance
[38:28] becomes labor displace displacement.
[38:32] This is going to be next year, guys.
[38:34] Charlie Munger, show me the incentive
[38:36] and I will show you the outcome. The
[38:38] incentive in US capitalism has long been
[38:40] maximizing shareholder returns.
[38:41] Therefore, the outcome is predictable.
[38:43] Firms pursue efficiency, automation, and
[38:45] cost reduction even when it comes at the
[38:47] expense of labor. This is going to be a
[38:49] dominant issue and that's before this. I
[38:52] will be doing more research for 22V over
[38:55] the course of the rest of this year in
[38:56] preparation for humanoid robots. So, I
[38:59] just started doing my research, deep
[39:01] research to come up with the reports.
[39:03] Just to give you an idea, again, this is
[39:06] about a third of my prompt in terms of
[39:10] what gets done for my deep research for
[39:13] humanoids. Buzz around Gemini 3 Pro. So,
[39:16] Gemini 3 is coming out soon. The
[39:18] leaprogging and the moving comes and as
[39:20] I've mentioned Gemini has pretty much
[39:22] taken over at least for me for all my
[39:24] deep research reports for sure. Major
[39:27] advancements in cancer this week. Sundar
[39:30] Pchai himself put this out. An exciting
[39:33] milestone for AI and science are
[39:36] built with Yale and based on Gemma
[39:39] generated a novel hypothesis about
[39:41] cancer cellular labor which scientists
[39:43] experimentally validate and live in
[39:44] cells. This discovery may reveal a
[39:47] promising new pathway for de developing
[39:49] therapies to fight cancer.
[39:52] Then there was another one this week.
[39:53] Another huge AI cancer breakthrough from
[39:55] Google. This is two days later. Two AI
[39:58] cancer breakthrough announced in just
[40:00] two days. 2025 will be remembered as the
[40:03] last normal year before the world went
[40:05] fully exponential.
[40:09] To finish up the Dave Blondon side, he
[40:11] went through the embodied AI, but this
[40:13] gets into the longevity and sequences
[40:15] side. So for for humanoid robots,
[40:18] physical labor costs fall towards
[40:19] energy.
[40:21] We're at the point of humanoids. It's
[40:22] going to start going. He talks about the
[40:24] fact that there will be hundreds of
[40:25] thousands by 2030. The Elon Mus thing is
[40:28] very important in terms of what they
[40:30] announced there. Figure O figure AI has
[40:32] been releasing videos of figure 03. They
[40:35] seem to be wanting to get it ahead of
[40:37] Musk to show what their stuff can do.
[40:39] Regardless of what actually happens,
[40:41] humanoids are coming. Now, in terms of
[40:43] longevity, something else to put into
[40:45] this since you're hearing how much
[40:46] people are uh we're not having kids, uh
[40:50] we're now entering the point where
[40:51] escape velocity math gaining two healthy
[40:55] years buys times for the next wave of
[40:56] discoveries. That adds another two on
[40:58] top of it. Um
[41:01] we're at the point of singularity, guys.
[41:04] I don't know how to say it. Singularity
[41:05] as a step function. Um there's going to
[41:08] be a surge of a 100 times to 10,000
[41:10] times capability in a few days once
[41:12] recursive ideas and software advances
[41:13] land without new chips. Um he says it's
[41:17] around 2026 27 27. The problem is the
[41:21] physical buildout is going to take up 10
[41:23] to 20 years. So on the humanoid side we
[41:25] already have everything we need. We just
[41:27] don't have the physical side yet. That's
[41:28] why I keep saying the PMIs have to go
[41:30] higher now because the software is
[41:31] ready.
[41:34] The physical side is not go buy your PMI
[41:38] stuff, go buy your transports,
[41:40] especially after China US margin
[41:42] pressure to favor AI native orgs. And
[41:45] again, this gets into the fact that
[41:46] bigger companies are going to have
[41:47] problems. He shows the ones there. We're
[41:49] up to 90 gawatts by 2029. Uh that's
[41:53] higher than what was expected not that
[41:55] long ago. And again, the singularity,
[41:58] this thing is saying it's here and we
[42:01] start going up. 2025 will will feel
[42:04] pretty boring. Um, I wrote this uh in
[42:07] Substack this week. Um,
[42:10] this is as much for your kids as it is
[42:12] you. But if you want to stay on top of
[42:14] what's happening, do not read Dex. Do
[42:17] not read Mckenzie reports. Do not read
[42:19] any of that stuff. Just go to podcast.
[42:21] These guys are unconstrained. They can
[42:24] talk. They can say whatever they want.
[42:26] uh they may not say anything about the
[42:28] revenues of the company, but right now
[42:30] you can basically infer them from what
[42:32] they're saying about everything else.
[42:34] Crypto. So, we had one of the largest
[42:37] liquidation events in history. Uh that
[42:41] was post um the Trump stuff last week,
[42:44] but Bitcoin continued to trade lower uh
[42:47] and basically is back down to where it
[42:50] was at the end of 2024. It's basically
[42:53] unchanged since December. uh despite
[42:56] being up whatever uh 12% now this year,
[42:59] something along those lines. Um, forget
[43:02] the Bitcoin four-year cycle. I have been
[43:05] completely shocked at how many times
[43:07] this has been brought up to me. Um, and
[43:09] people telling me it's real. And I guess
[43:11] the reason they're telling me it's real
[43:12] is because like when you have two data
[43:14] points, the end of 17, look at that
[43:16] peak. And then we didn't take it out
[43:18] again until 20. And then this peak, and
[43:20] we didn't take it out again until 24. So
[43:23] basically in this period in here, I've
[43:27] been hearing repeatedly that you're
[43:29] underestimating that at the end of
[43:30] October, that's approximately when the
[43:32] having when the four-year cycle will end
[43:34] and will go down. So I just want to say
[43:37] everything to anyone in the crypto
[43:39] world. You're leaving one part out,
[43:41] which is the S&P went down both of those
[43:44] times when and then Bitcoin bottomed
[43:47] when the S&P did in both cases. So, I
[43:50] hate to say this. This is going down
[43:52] while the S&P is at all-time highs. And
[43:54] I believe the S&P is going to be powered
[43:56] higher by massive capex spend next year.
[43:59] Lower inflation than what we all
[44:01] anticipated. Gas at the pump, guys, is
[44:03] now at 305, down from 320. I don't know
[44:06] how you're going to get your inflation
[44:07] prints. You think we're about to cut
[44:08] rates, but most importantly, the
[44:11] benefits from AI are flowing through on
[44:13] a productivity basis, which means profit
[44:15] margins are spreading to the other
[44:17] companies. So, you're going to get the
[44:19] massive effect next year. I fully expect
[44:21] the S&P to have another good year. And
[44:24] that means that Bitcoin is going to go
[44:26] higher. And if I'm right, this is also
[44:29] the year that the singularity does the
[44:32] disruption. That to me is what Bitcoin
[44:34] is all about. I've talked about the
[44:35] Bitcoin miners, which I think are
[44:37] already getting a big thing. Now, that
[44:39] means next year for me is about Elon
[44:41] Musk, Bitcoin,
[44:44] and no AI bubble.
[44:46] Why people think Elon Musk Bitcoin and
[44:48] the AI boom. So the same people that are
[44:50] bearish
[44:51] AI right now are bearish Bitcoin and
[44:54] they're bearish Elon Musk and also Micro
[44:56] Strategy doesn't really matter. They're
[44:58] bearish all of them for the same reason
[44:59] because they think they're scams. So if
[45:01] you know these people and you're reading
[45:02] them, just know they're having fun with
[45:04] this. They love saying this is there.
[45:06] Disruption feels like deception. Hype
[45:09] outruns understanding. Skepticism is
[45:11] safer than belief. I just want to say
[45:14] that at some point if you've said Elon
[45:16] Musk is is a scam, which I did at some
[45:18] point, not thinking that a human being
[45:20] could possibly manage more than one
[45:22] business, Bitcoin. I didn't buy into it
[45:25] in any way, shape, or form as an
[45:27] investment until 2020.
[45:30] And AI, this one I've been on since the
[45:32] day I went to Silicon Valley back in
[45:34] 2013, and I changed my view on Amazon.
[45:37] The majority of people never change
[45:38] their views. They put stuff out in
[45:40] public and they really can't ever get
[45:41] off of it, so they just keep doing it,
[45:43] so ignore it. John Vonoman, um, if you
[45:46] haven't heard of John Vonoyman, he was
[45:48] the person that basically originally
[45:50] talked about the singularity. He was one
[45:52] of the people involved in the Manhattan
[45:54] Project.
[45:56] Um, and he wrote basically this in in in
[45:59] the 1950s.
[46:01] It centered on the ever accelerating
[46:03] progress of technology and changes in
[46:04] the mode of human life which gives the
[46:06] appearance of approaching some essential
[46:08] singularity in the history of the race
[46:10] beyond which human affairs as we know
[46:13] them could not continue.
[46:16] The key insight acceleration itself
[46:17] would lead to unpredictability a future
[46:20] incomprehensible
[46:22] by existing models of thought. Think
[46:24] leis think uh debt and deficits. Think
[46:28] of all the things you want. They're all
[46:30] being impacted by the singularity, which
[46:33] is this. That's it for this week, guys.
[46:35] Have a great week.
