--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] right another week and uh another rough
[00:03] week uh for risk we did uh sustain a
[00:06] rally for a bit of time and then ran
[00:09] into some resistance at some technical
[00:11] levels and then we got more tariff fears
[00:14] and more AI buildout
[00:16] fears uh asset prices are building in
[00:19] more recession risk so I'll show you
[00:21] some of those um it it's broadening out
[00:24] in terms of the market starting to
[00:26] Discount things uh it's been the worst
[00:28] month for credit since 2022 with uh one
[00:31] day left uh sentiment continues to
[00:35] fall I'm going to bring up the fact that
[00:37] to me now it's starting to become a
[00:39] little bit more clear um what the new
[00:41] macro regime is going to be so I'll go
[00:44] through that in the final half and just
[00:46] highlight my views on on what's going on
[00:49] and I think you have to keep in
[00:50] perspective that the administration is
[00:54] going to be running these policies uh
[00:57] for the next four years and when I say
[00:58] those policies
[01:00] I think uncertainty is going to remain
[01:03] uh they're going to focus on making sure
[01:05] they win the AI arms race the tariffs at
[01:08] this point uh are real and the question
[01:10] is only how much are they going to do uh
[01:14] I still do not believe uh there will be
[01:17] really any chance of a recession uh we
[01:20] could have a quarter or two of negative
[01:22] GDP but again recession for me is when
[01:24] we're going to lose a significant amount
[01:27] of jobs and it's going to take time to
[01:28] find new jobs so when you go through the
[01:31] whole thing you're looking for what the
[01:33] market is doing and it is definitely a
[01:36] repricing multiples on
[01:39] technology software and the mag 7 and at
[01:42] the same time it is rotating money into
[01:45] the themes uh that I think are the
[01:47] strongest and I'll go through those uh
[01:49] the power needs again continues to be a
[01:51] theme that I've talked about really
[01:53] really since uh September October and
[01:57] the other thing is the rise of the
[01:58] inefficient the this this is the macro
[02:00] regime that I think is taking taking
[02:02] place is the need for uh the embodiment
[02:05] of AI the buildout of the data centers
[02:07] everything that's coming over the next
[02:09] five years regardless of whether Nvidia
[02:11] sells all the chips or the multiples on
[02:13] those stocks go down and then the
[02:15] inefficient I'll spend some time on in
[02:16] terms of companies that have tremendous
[02:18] cash flow have steady revenues uh but
[02:21] are going to benefit from AI adoption
[02:23] and then I'll finish off with custodia
[02:25] bank and and what went on with the first
[02:26] stable coin um in terms of just
[02:30] what happened last week this is the S&P
[02:33] uh 500 chart and if you look at this and
[02:38] you go through it we failed exactly
[02:41] where we should have so uh the Gap out
[02:44] the Gap up that we had uh from the
[02:46] election we went back down to that day
[02:48] before uh the lows that we had for the
[02:51] year before we started sell off in
[02:53] February and the 200 day moving average
[02:55] so everything failed there when you get
[02:57] failures at technical levels and they
[02:59] now now used to be support and they act
[03:01] as uh resistance that just shows that
[03:04] right now the market is in a downtrend
[03:06] um and you're going to need some
[03:08] positive uh uh catalysts that I think
[03:11] are related to tariffs at this point to
[03:13] actually get it uh to find a sustainable
[03:15] bid uh but I think the administration
[03:17] doesn't want the market to go higher as
[03:19] I said last week so I think you're going
[03:20] to run into these things even if we go
[03:22] down retest the lows and then bounce
[03:24] back uh in terms of the mag 7 it was the
[03:27] sixth week in a row that we were down we
[03:30] did seven in a row back in 2022 that was
[03:33] actually fairly close to the lows of the
[03:35] market we went back and retested again
[03:38] uh but it's been six weeks in a row so
[03:40] again we're oversold we're going into
[03:42] that April 2nd period um I'll go through
[03:45] the sentiment people are very negative
[03:47] uh so I think as we go into it a retest
[03:49] of the lows possibly even taking out the
[03:51] lows maybe another Bounce from there
[03:54] depending on what goes on with the
[03:55] tariffs any any positive news again
[03:57] because of how negative we'll get you
[03:59] another short covering rally the RO it's
[04:01] still a rotation so this is the S&P
[04:03] cumulative breath you can't even tell
[04:05] that anything is going on uh we're
[04:07] basically at the same level we were at
[04:08] the be you know at the end of uh January
[04:11] and we've just gone sideways so again
[04:13] I'll keep saying it it's a rotation but
[04:16] uh the auto tariffs got us to sell off a
[04:18] little bit on Wednesday and then the
[04:20] focus shifted and again more and
[04:23] more rhetoric from the White House
[04:26] particularly Trump again that um they're
[04:29] going to keep pushing on this regardless
[04:30] of what happens and this was a story out
[04:33] today this morning Trump pushes aids to
[04:35] go bigger on tariff says key deadline
[04:37] near uh we have no idea how much of this
[04:39] is negotiation but the reality is the
[04:42] uncertainty that it's creating makes it
[04:44] impossible to take a long-term position
[04:46] on the index itself the rotation
[04:49] continues to go on but as I'm going to
[04:52] go through we've actually seen some some
[04:54] shifts that it's starting to spread a
[04:55] little bit more a lot of bad news uh for
[04:58] NVIDIA this week you had another article
[05:01] from tday Cowen uh TD Cowan on Microsoft
[05:05] cancelling some data center projects
[05:07] again I this should not be surprising to
[05:10] anyone but uh at this point any bad news
[05:12] is bad news you had core weave having to
[05:15] lower its IPO uh down significantly from
[05:18] where it was
[05:20] expected uh in China uh you've got a lot
[05:23] of stories floating around that Chinese
[05:25] chips are making some Headway and
[05:27] they're still behind Nvidia but uh
[05:30] you're starting to get more and more
[05:31] stories outside of China about
[05:33] breakthrough using Chinese Chips so all
[05:36] of this went on you also had Joe Sai
[05:38] from Alibaba warn of a bubble in the AI
[05:40] data center buildout so another one
[05:42] saying they're probably
[05:44] overbuilding uh and then out of China
[05:47] they put in some new energy efficient
[05:49] rules that could block H20 chips and new
[05:52] data centers so again all of the orders
[05:54] in China there's just more fears in
[05:57] terms of what's Happening uh with inside
[05:59] uh Nvidia and I think what the market is
[06:02] showing you is there's really no room
[06:04] for bad news with these guys spending
[06:06] money anymore and that's kind of the
[06:08] theme is I I think people are starting
[06:10] to recognize post deep seek uh with all
[06:14] this news coming out that regardless of
[06:16] what the revenues are now regardless of
[06:18] what they're doing we have lost the
[06:21] speculative nature of AI in terms of the
[06:24] hyperscalers and Nvidia for a very
[06:26] important reason because if you're going
[06:28] to Value things for you years out
[06:30] meaning four years of trump four years
[06:32] of a tra possible trade War four years
[06:35] of uncertainty over the AI buildout and
[06:38] four years of just no room for error in
[06:40] terms of the multiples I think they're
[06:42] building in that uncertainty into the
[06:44] prices and that's why we're seeing a
[06:45] multiple compression in the highest
[06:47] multiple names and you're seeing
[06:49] rotation from those extremely large
[06:51] names into other places consumer uh
[06:54] expectations came out the conference
[06:55] board consumer expectations we're at
[06:57] levels now associated with kind of a
[07:00] recession so you know whether it's in
[07:02] here recession whether it's recession
[07:04] here here we had a period in 11 when we
[07:07] thought the EU was going to break up and
[07:08] then subsequently in in
[07:10] 2013 uh but the reality is we're back
[07:13] down to
[07:14] levels uh in consumer confidence where
[07:17] people are uncertain there is a
[07:18] political side but as I'm going to show
[07:20] you this is spreading more and more with
[07:21] the data we had on Friday in terms of
[07:23] real spending uh you've taken the
[07:25] Atlanta fed GDP number now for the first
[07:28] quarter down to minus 2.8
[07:30] so we're still you know people can go
[07:32] through the gold Imports and get this
[07:34] back you're talking about a number
[07:35] somewhere near zero somewhere minus5 to
[07:38] plus5 uh so we're having a weak quarter
[07:41] I wanted to Overlay this with 10e rates
[07:43] because one of the things that has been
[07:45] I I think a big negative uh at this
[07:49] point for what's happening in the white
[07:51] house if they were orchestrating to get
[07:54] weaker GDP well they're clearly getting
[07:56] it even if some of it is not related to
[07:59] um Trump is just kind of the first
[08:01] quarter with weather and uh California
[08:04] but 10e rates are just not falling and
[08:06] the problem is if they have a quote
[08:09] unquote uh Bond put out there the stock
[08:12] market is back down again to levels seen
[08:14] in September mid-september we've got the
[08:16] six-month rate of change now negative
[08:18] and bond yields are up 60 basis points
[08:20] since last September so they're not
[08:22] getting what they want uh in terms of
[08:24] just the health of the market from a
[08:26] recession perspective the white line
[08:28] here is the equal consumer discretionary
[08:30] vers Staples uh broke through barely but
[08:33] broke through the lows that we made back
[08:36] there so this is saying uh again that
[08:39] the market is rotating away from
[08:43] anything related to growth uh and it's
[08:46] moving into things which have some kind
[08:47] of
[08:49] stability six-month rate of change on
[08:51] the S&P if you if if I had to figure out
[08:54] a recession model at this stage uh at
[08:57] least one that would have the highest
[08:58] probability of of having two quarters of
[09:00] negative GDP with just two indicators I
[09:03] would want uh the S&P 500 rate of change
[09:07] I would you know the six month over six
[09:09] month is a very good warning sign for
[09:11] recessions and then the second one would
[09:13] be the jobless claims we haven't seen
[09:14] jobless claims go up at all we now have
[09:16] the S&P uh 500 at the largest negative
[09:19] 6mon over 6 month since early 23 the
[09:22] reason this is important just so
[09:24] everyone gets it rate of change this
[09:26] means that we are lower than we were 6
[09:28] months ago uh by 2.4% so this is not
[09:31] something which just started in January
[09:33] at this point we've done enough damage
[09:35] in the market that this is way back um
[09:38] to show this this is the same number
[09:40] six-month rate of change the orange line
[09:43] here is the G10 City Surprise index so
[09:45] this has been happening with the City
[09:47] Surprise index actually near uh 15-month
[09:50] highs in terms of again City Surprise
[09:53] index is just the G10 numbers are
[09:55] actually beating expectations you
[09:57] wouldn't expect the S&P to be down here
[09:59] and that's one of the reasons why at
[10:01] this point as things worsen you got to
[10:03] be a little bit more concerned as we
[10:05] approach the lows that if he's going to
[10:06] go full B full boat on the tariffs and
[10:09] he's actually going to do enough to
[10:11] where people take GDP down seriously
[10:14] even if this is still a negotiating
[10:16] tactic the market is now weakening at a
[10:19] pace where you're going to see more and
[10:20] more people take off risk because I
[10:22] think there's a no Moss mentality that's
[10:24] entered and it's showing up in credit so
[10:26] this is the high yield OAS option
[10:28] adjusted spread spread uh we broke
[10:31] through uh the March wides and we are
[10:33] now moving faster I wouldn't worry is
[10:35] now where we are relative to these times
[10:37] in history this can happen very quickly
[10:39] you can go to 500 there's no liquidity
[10:41] so if this moves which again it's
[10:44] starting to kind of have that parabolic
[10:46] feel if you look at this one this was
[10:48] kind of a three-day move this has been
[10:50] going on now for a period of time the
[10:52] last time we saw anything like this was
[10:53] back here and so you could you're kind
[10:57] of looking for something to happen on
[10:58] the Tariff side to make people get a
[11:01] little bit better I just don't think
[11:02] there's anything on the economic side
[11:03] that's going to end up surprising on the
[11:05] upside and I don't think the earnings
[11:07] side is going to surprise on the upside
[11:09] either while we're going through this
[11:10] tariff so you're going to need some kind
[11:11] of a positive Catalyst out of the white
[11:14] house uh to get through this negotiation
[11:17] and not turn it into a trade war and I
[11:19] think at this point most people are
[11:20] worried about a trade war and you're
[11:21] starting to see trade War pick up in
[11:23] terms of the sentiment uh this is the
[11:26] biggest monthly widening in credit we're
[11:28] at 51 basis points on the high yield OAS
[11:30] last time we saw this was again near the
[11:32] lows in June of 22 so we are getting a
[11:34] lot of movements on this in terms of
[11:37] people uh getting worried this is uh the
[11:40] consumer confidence percentage of people
[11:43] surveyed that believe stocks will
[11:44] increase over the next year this is for
[11:47] the quarter this is the worst drop in a
[11:50] quarter uh basically on in history this
[11:53] goes all the way back to the beginning
[11:55] of it 1987 and you can see the periods
[11:57] in time where we had more more these are
[12:00] during extended bare markets um this is
[12:02] 1990 during the recession this is you
[12:05] know year two into the market peaking
[12:07] and going down this is the great
[12:08] financial crisis so you've had a huge
[12:10] move lower in terms of expectations of
[12:12] stocks going higher and if you take uh
[12:16] if you take it relative to increases uh
[12:19] versus decreases well now you have more
[12:21] decreases than increases so we just had
[12:23] this massive drop off in in one month so
[12:26] the sentiment on that has uh has worked
[12:29] and then if you just look at what's
[12:31] happening on the uncertainty index it
[12:34] just continues to move higher uh and
[12:37] here it is related to the S&P 500 20-day
[12:39] realized VA so the one thing I will say
[12:41] is as this has gone higher 20-day
[12:43] realized V has viewed this as he's he's
[12:46] not he's not going to do this he's not
[12:47] going to go full in and again that's
[12:49] where I think the the the risk is in the
[12:51] marketplace is that people may be
[12:53] underestimating uh how how much
[12:56] tolerance he has for the market to go
[12:58] down before he goes at this point we're
[13:01] back down towards 10% off the highs I
[13:03] definitely think as I said that you
[13:05] could see in a uh in a you know scenario
[13:08] where he decides to let this go further
[13:11] I think it could quickly get down to
[13:12] 5,000 which would be another 10 another
[13:15] 10% from here and take us into the you
[13:17] know down for the year close to 13 14%
[13:21] and more importantly down about 20 C 20%
[13:24] off the highs so if this week goes
[13:27] through and if he's got higher than
[13:29] expected tariffs on kind of the scenario
[13:31] where we're going to have a tax uh a
[13:33] tariff rate that is up above 10% I think
[13:37] the market is just at this point going
[13:38] to reduce risk even further having no
[13:40] certainty as to when this is going to
[13:42] end at the same time uh I bring this up
[13:45] because L musk did do an interview this
[13:46] week with Brett Bear and he said he's
[13:48] absolutely going to be able to reduce
[13:50] the deficit uh by $1
[13:53] trillion before he leaves in at the end
[13:55] of May um that's a that's a big
[13:59] statement um if he's able to cut that
[14:01] match it says two two things one is what
[14:04] is the economic impact from that uh he
[14:06] says it's not going to be the money's
[14:09] going somewhere so unless it's sitting
[14:11] somewhere or they're just clearing up
[14:12] some stuff that it's not really actually
[14:15] going through the economy it's going to
[14:16] leave the economy and so there's going
[14:18] to be an impact so there's one side is
[14:19] the economic the second side I'll get
[14:21] into uh a little bit later as part of
[14:23] the rest of it in terms of the Dallas
[14:26] fed energy survey this came out this
[14:27] week I think this is really interesting
[14:29] this is obviously in Trump country um
[14:32] this was in the comment section of that
[14:34] Dallas fed energy survey and I just want
[14:35] to highlight some of these the key word
[14:37] to describe is so far as uncertainty
[14:40] there cannot be us energy dominance and
[14:42] $50 per hour those $50 per barrel oil
[14:46] those two statements are contradictory
[14:48] at $50 per barrel oil we will see energy
[14:50] production start to decline
[14:51] significantly this is not energy
[14:53] dominance um the administration's chaos
[14:56] is a disaster for the C commodity
[14:58] markets Dr baby drill is nothing but a
[15:00] myth uh and populist cry uh I've never
[15:03] felt more uncertainty about our business
[15:05] in our entire 40-year career the only
[15:07] certainty right now is uncertainty with
[15:09] that in mind we are approaching the
[15:10] econom this economic cycle economic
[15:13] cycle with heightened Capital discipline
[15:14] and a focus on long-term resilience even
[15:17] in Trump country and oil where we
[15:18] supposed to be a big positive where we
[15:20] have tremendous power needs the
[15:23] sentiment uh is uncertain and people are
[15:26] not happy about the trade War at this
[15:27] point um you had Javier BL
[15:31] bloth who writes for Bloomberg was at
[15:33] sah week uh and he basically said the
[15:36] mood at the annual jamere with 10,000
[15:39] Executives should have been ulent it
[15:41] wasn't uh Executives far more worried
[15:44] about Trump's push for lower oil prices
[15:46] and the potential of a trade War induced
[15:48] recession so again I I I don't know how
[15:51] to say it um right now the market is
[15:54] rotating we're heading back towards the
[15:56] lows ahead of April 2nd if we get some
[15:59] something that is anywhere in line to
[16:02] clear I do think the market will bounce
[16:04] because I don't think we're going to
[16:05] have a recession I think people just
[16:07] want the rules so don't get all worried
[16:09] about the Tariff situation but at the
[16:10] same time the market is weakening and we
[16:13] know there's losses out there and you
[16:15] could get more liquidations if all of a
[16:17] sudden credit continues to widen because
[16:18] people increased the recession risk and
[16:20] that's where we are at this point is the
[16:22] stock market now is trading off
[16:23] recession risk and if recession risk
[16:27] increases uh the stock market has to go
[16:29] lower to represent it and that would be
[16:31] seen through credit which has now
[16:32] already taken out the the wides while
[16:35] the S&P has not taken out the lows um
[16:37] we're finishing up a quarter right now
[16:38] we have one day left where S&P relative
[16:41] to the world X the US is having its
[16:44] worst uh quarter in the last 30 years so
[16:48] the rotation goes on one thing I think
[16:51] is important is the Dax again you can't
[16:53] see the top of the chart now you can um
[16:56] rate of change here is about to turn
[16:59] negative on the 50-day as well so we've
[17:01] been above the 50-day the entire time
[17:02] since November since the election now
[17:05] we're back below it I bring that up
[17:06] again because if we start having
[17:07] recession risk in the US the reality is
[17:10] for everybody if credit starts to
[17:13] weakend then the global economy starts
[17:15] to weaken if the us is going if fears of
[17:17] recession it's going to spread
[17:18] throughout the globe and nobody will be
[17:19] safe uh and you'll start to see
[17:21] everything start to to break low that's
[17:23] what the next phase would be and that's
[17:24] where we're at and that's what the
[17:25] market is starting to show so I think
[17:27] it's a big week for trying to find some
[17:29] stability rather than try to guess what
[17:31] he's going to do um again I think we're
[17:34] going to be in this kind of Uncertain
[17:36] environment for at least the the next
[17:38] three months uh and anyone trying to
[17:41] pick a bottom at this point I think
[17:42] you're going to run into resistance
[17:43] above we need to see something change
[17:45] here other than just some some positive
[17:48] short covering days where we get breath
[17:49] thrust we actually need to see the mag s
[17:52] starts to stabilize somewhere they are
[17:54] down 16% so that could happen at any
[17:57] point since the earnings are still for
[17:59] to be good but the rotation continues so
[18:01] this is where I want to segue into uh
[18:04] just what I think is happening so again
[18:06] I focused Market's now down 5.11 per
[18:08] year-to date it's pretty much all the
[18:11] tech names so this is the mag 7 right
[18:13] here and then everything else is up
[18:15] Industrials have now kind of sunk to the
[18:17] negative materials are barely up energy
[18:20] healthc care utilities these are power
[18:23] for AI the energy sector and the utility
[18:25] sectors are names that have cash flow
[18:28] they're going to have cash flow because
[18:30] the en energy needs are going to go
[18:31] higher n gas is going higher so with
[18:34] with oil down you still have these doing
[18:36] well this is a structural play that I
[18:38] think is in the midst of a regime shift
[18:41] these to me their valuations again I
[18:43] think the AI buildout uh fears will
[18:45] remain for the foreseeable future and I
[18:47] actually think you can make the argument
[18:49] that three years from now because AI is
[18:51] moving so fast so you don't know what is
[18:53] going to be necessary uh for companies
[18:55] like Nvidia but you also have the
[18:56] competition from China and if Nvidia has
[18:58] those uncertainties then all of these
[19:00] names have these uncertainties from a
[19:02] spending basis financials has a
[19:04] deregulation Tailwind which I think
[19:06] we'll keep it there and then healthc
[19:07] care is part of this inefficient thing
[19:09] which I'll I'll show as we get through
[19:12] but I think that's the structural change
[19:14] in terms of the hyperscalers and the
[19:16] main issue and I want to bring this up
[19:18] because every time Microsoft has any
[19:20] data center things it becomes an issue
[19:23] nadell is very very clear on the dwar
[19:26] podcast that um he doesn't believe in an
[19:29] AGI Milestone which means he's not
[19:31] interested in chasing for the AI God and
[19:34] building stuff out without any concept
[19:37] of what it'll look like three years from
[19:39] now he's not interested in that he wants
[19:41] to deal with the applications he wants
[19:43] to deal with other parts of it and not
[19:45] be involved in this spending money at
[19:48] any Pace over the course of the next few
[19:50] years uh he does believe that compute is
[19:53] still a major theme and will be
[19:54] necessary but he believes as he says
[19:56] here that you're going to have something
[19:58] that's monetized so why should you go
[20:00] jumping in and go through it so uh it
[20:03] says he he did say well he didn't say
[20:06] that his company will stop building data
[20:08] centers uh and remember they just
[20:10] started Three Mile Island so I think all
[20:12] the fears on this that keep coming out
[20:14] should not be a surprise and if you
[20:16] haven't listened to that interview uh
[20:19] it's absolutely uh something you should
[20:21] you should listen to uh in terms of
[20:23] going but I think nadell revealed that
[20:25] by 2728 Microsoft plans to lease much of
[20:28] it computer power instead of building
[20:29] more itself which means they're still
[20:30] building now um so don't doubt the needs
[20:33] of the data centers don't doubt the
[20:35] buildout doubt the fact that the
[20:37] valuation shouldn't be there so at some
[20:40] point if Nvidia actually in the second
[20:42] half of the year is beating numbers you
[20:43] will get a bounce I just don't think
[20:45] you're going to see the 50 to 100% type
[20:47] upside even if the earnings come through
[20:50] much better than expected I think you
[20:51] can they can they can grow somewhat with
[20:54] earnings but I think the bar is Shifting
[20:56] and I don't think people are going to
[20:57] dive back into into these for a lot of
[20:59] reasons I think this is a regime shift I
[21:02] think this is 17 years of a software
[21:04] boom where us dominance was there and
[21:07] now we're in something that over the
[21:08] course of at least the next five is
[21:10] going to shift more towards things that
[21:11] have been left for dead that have lower
[21:14] multiples still have tremendous cash
[21:15] flow and steady side but if we're going
[21:18] to be in a period where we're trying to
[21:19] get the deficit down to 3% that's not
[21:21] the same as when we took the deficit up
[21:23] to 7% and we were spending and remember
[21:26] the debt in 2007 when the iPhone came
[21:29] out was 9 trillion now it's 36 trillion
[21:31] and we're focused on it um more news on
[21:34] Tech Giants need to stop racing to build
[21:35] AI Gods I think you just have to keep
[21:37] this in there I think investors are
[21:38] doubting it uh open AI $125 billion
[21:42] dream still not expecting to be
[21:44] profitable before 2029 this is not the
[21:47] same environment as it was during the
[21:49] 2010s when Amazon could get away with
[21:51] this consistently and continue to grow
[21:54] as much as I love AI um open AI has not
[21:57] been able to show away that they're to
[21:58] be able to charge people more money they
[22:00] have a dominant market share but if that
[22:02] company is not able at this point with
[22:04] the best product uh and charging the
[22:08] most money and they're not able to say
[22:09] they'll be profitable by by 2029 it's a
[22:12] very scary thing uh and they seem to be
[22:14] in dedicated to the race uh for AGI uh
[22:18] Jensen yuang made it very clear this
[22:20] week uh that
[22:22] China is his biggest fear and I think
[22:25] that's going to be there I don't think
[22:26] that's going away um there's so much
[22:28] much Ascension by China each week
[22:30] whether it's the chips whether it was
[22:32] deep seek out of nowhere whether it was
[22:34] Manis on the agent side they are
[22:36] continuing to keep coming and I think
[22:38] that is a disruptive force uh and that
[22:40] leaves us right here where the mag 7
[22:43] earnings they're still forecast to be
[22:45] higher the market is breaking down so if
[22:48] the earnings are able to come in the
[22:49] question is will this go back up or will
[22:51] we just be going sideways here uh on
[22:54] this basis so I think it's important and
[22:57] the reason is because their forward
[22:59] price to sale ratios are sitting up here
[23:01] here's the rest of the market uh this is
[23:03] the S&P and this is the S&P X this group
[23:07] so we're just at a point where the rest
[23:09] of the market um May benefit more from
[23:12] AI adoption and so any weakness on the
[23:14] profit margins uh we're up at these
[23:17] levels again X the mag uh the mag 8 mag
[23:22] 7 whatever you want from them we're
[23:25] we're just at levels that are extreme
[23:27] you don't have a you don't have the
[23:30] ability of missing numbers uh my
[23:32] substack from this week went through
[23:34] that next phase of AI from intelligence
[23:36] to embodiment um the humanoid that will
[23:39] be a structural structural movement
[23:41] going forward we're in a race for the
[23:43] hardware side we're in a race for AI
[23:45] That's not going to change the
[23:46] administration is going to make sure of
[23:48] it and so as I highlighted last week
[23:50] this is Chevron relative to the S&P
[23:53] total collapse relative to it and now
[23:55] all of a sudden uh this is moving higher
[23:57] and I fully expect expect that Chevron
[23:59] will continue to do well so far it's
[24:01] doing well versus the mag 7 coming down
[24:04] but I just think you have to be aware of
[24:05] these companies that have just not been
[24:07] owned and they're going to benefit from
[24:09] this so let's get into the power side uh
[24:11] this is from Goldman Sachs in terms of
[24:13] when they think will reach some kind of
[24:16] uh you know capacity situation which is
[24:19] 2627 and if this is true and all of a
[24:22] sudden we reach here and then in 28
[24:24] we're just not you know we're not
[24:25] dealing we're not in the same situation
[24:28] you obviously have a scenario that
[24:30] should be built into the market at this
[24:31] point we've lost the momentum of let's
[24:33] just pay for that and we moved in some
[24:35] other side and I think that's because of
[24:37] what's going on with the administration
[24:39] in terms of the forward uncertainty uh
[24:41] growth in global energy demand surged in
[24:43] 2024 to almost twice its recent average
[24:45] this is just to support what we've
[24:47] already done ahead of the increase in
[24:49] demand ener economic growth now depends
[24:51] on electricity not oil so we've moved to
[24:54] the
[24:54] electrification uh Eric Schmidt put this
[24:57] article out at the end of December just
[25:00] uh on the need for energy for AI and AI
[25:02] for energy and within there uh he just
[25:05] said AI Technologies as they Advance
[25:08] their energy consumption is set to
[25:10] increase substantially posing a risk of
[25:12] energy shortages that could hinder
[25:13] technological Pro uh progress um he does
[25:16] talk about the fact that AI itself will
[25:18] enhance Energy Efficiency over time and
[25:21] again I that's the way I should think
[25:22] you should think about the chart of the
[25:24] next two years there's a massive
[25:26] buildout whether or not year three and
[25:28] year four that's going to be as
[25:29] necessary it seems like this is really
[25:31] to get us up to speed on this uh but
[25:35] that just means these energy companies
[25:37] are just going to have tremendous amount
[25:39] of demand and the buildout and I don't
[25:42] think people have fully grasped how much
[25:43] we're talking about uh Global energy
[25:46] demand Rose by 2.2% last year this was
[25:49] despite slower growth in China where
[25:52] energy consumption Rose by less than 3%
[25:55] half its 2023 rate so now you have China
[25:57] pick up uh this was
[26:00] 2.2 faster than the average annual
[26:03] increase between 2013 and 2023 I mean
[26:06] that it's a very powerful statement to
[26:08] just say that that demand is going up
[26:10] that much yes it's mainly electricity uh
[26:13] but it it is happening uh and remember
[26:16] we still have a goal to reach Net Zero
[26:20] uh even if the US isn't focused on it
[26:22] you're still talking about requiring 75
[26:25] trillion of investment um this isn't
[26:27] going away uh and just to put like how
[26:31] much of a change this is and again why
[26:34] you should be thinking about this in a
[26:35] different perspective so here we are
[26:38] average annual electricity load growth
[26:41] steady decline for 50 years down to here
[26:44] then it goes sideways nominal GDP is
[26:47] still growing and we've become more
[26:48] efficient then all of a sudden 2022 Chad
[26:51] gbt comes out 2023 we get this increase
[26:54] now in 2024 we just went back above the
[26:57] 1990s level and this is expected to go
[27:00] significantly higher going forward so
[27:02] this is real and it comes at a time
[27:04] where technology is 30% consumer
[27:07] discretionary is 10 which is mainly
[27:10] Amazon consume communication Services
[27:12] which is other mag seven names 10 so you
[27:15] have about 50% of the waiting is now
[27:19] Innovation or technology and energy is
[27:23] 3.6% and utilities are 2.45 you just
[27:26] have a complete Miss waiting on the lack
[27:29] of investment and the lack of anything
[27:31] that's happened uh from the energy side
[27:34] for a period of you know a good whatever
[27:37] since 2008 so it's been almost 20 years
[27:40] um in terms of AI and how the government
[27:42] is going to keep going through this
[27:44] secretary Wright leads AI collaboration
[27:46] event from Oakbridge National Lab this
[27:48] is a global race uh there's just no way
[27:51] to stop it Tech leaders warn against
[27:53] Manhattan Project race for AI super
[27:56] intelligence AI Quantum race keeps going
[28:00] with China the robotics race with China
[28:02] keeps going Eric suggests countries
[28:05] could engage in a mutual assured AI
[28:07] malfunction you just have to realize
[28:09] that everyone is trying to win this
[28:11] battle and again to win this battle
[28:13] means more energy I don't see this
[28:15] changing with Trump's tariffs I don't
[28:17] see a recession happening which means
[28:19] the spend is going to happen this chart
[28:20] looks great we keep making higher lows
[28:23] all the way through here we haven't been
[28:25] able to break out we were making higher
[28:26] highs uh I think the energy sector as
[28:29] I've said repeatedly since October is a
[28:31] must have in your portfolio there's a
[28:34] lot of ways to play it don't get fixated
[28:36] only on the gas side Coal's being turned
[28:38] on uh MLPs are doing fantastic there's a
[28:42] lot of places you can go I just think
[28:44] that they're going to benefit
[28:45] significantly from the power needs this
[28:47] is where I want to bring this one back
[28:48] up again Alan mus is able to find a
[28:50] trillion dollars for one reason and one
[28:52] reason only because the government is
[28:53] arguably the most inefficient uh
[28:55] spending place and a place that has just
[28:57] gotten so big with bureaucracy that any
[29:00] kind of savings uh will fall to the
[29:03] bottom line quickly same thing goes for
[29:05] healthcare Healthcare maybe number two
[29:06] so the reason the healthc care sector in
[29:08] my opinion is doing well is because over
[29:11] the course of the next decade we will
[29:13] continue to have massive increases in
[29:15] health care expenditure so if the
[29:17] government is trying to slow down
[29:20] overall uh GDP nominal GDP you want to
[29:23] go to the places that are going to
[29:24] continue to grow and healthcare because
[29:26] of the Aging of the population because
[29:28] the health of the population just
[29:29] continues to be a bigger bigger portion
[29:32] of the spending the reason it hasn't
[29:34] been in there it's not sexy this is not
[29:36] something that you're going to get you
[29:37] know young day Traders sitting there
[29:39] going okay let me go buy some of these
[29:40] names unless they're biotech this is
[29:43] kind of a boring period which is why the
[29:45] Dax which is why Intel which is why
[29:47] Cisco which is why McKesson Cardinal
[29:50] Health as I show you some charts but
[29:52] generative Ai and Healthcare is
[29:55] absolutely happening and it's a big deal
[29:57] and so they're going to get a tremendous
[29:59] benefit this is a McKenzie report this
[30:01] is one of the pages from there 64%
[30:04] reported that they anticipated or had
[30:06] already Quantified positive Roi
[30:08] suggesting high expectations for Gen
[30:10] technology we're looking for positive
[30:12] return on
[30:14] investments we're not getting it from
[30:16] the hyperscalers as of yet maybe we will
[30:18] but they're already priced with
[30:19] multiples that are three in some cases
[30:23] four times where the healthcare names
[30:24] are and they've been growing revenues
[30:26] some of them are enormous in terms of
[30:28] what's gone on and they've been
[30:29] incorporating AI this is not something
[30:31] new and here's how you know when
[30:34] momentum
[30:35] unwinds here are two names in the
[30:37] healthcare sector cardinal cardinal
[30:39] health the white line and the orange
[30:41] line is McKesson well we have a momentum
[30:44] unwind these seem like momentum names
[30:45] they haven't budged the reason they
[30:47] haven't budged is because they're making
[30:48] money and they're reasonably priced and
[30:50] they're in that bucket right now where
[30:53] investors are looking for something
[30:54] where they're going to get the growth
[30:56] and they don't have to deal with
[30:57] multiple compression and so here is the
[31:00] PE on the S&P 500 which got up here
[31:03] driven by the mag 7 we've obviously seen
[31:05] a correction in the market and in
[31:07] particular we've seen a correction in
[31:09] the high multiple names and what you
[31:11] have here is you still have McKesson
[31:12] sitting at below Market multiple and
[31:15] Cardinal Health sitting down here and
[31:17] yet they've been producing significant
[31:19] returns in their price over this time so
[31:22] these are not the kind of names that
[31:24] people are going to go jump into but I
[31:25] think this is what's happening in the
[31:27] market as long as as we're in a
[31:28] situation where there's no speculative
[31:30] juices alive which I just don't see with
[31:33] the uncertainty and it doesn't seem like
[31:34] this Administration cares too much about
[31:36] allowing the speculative juices to go
[31:38] higher uh that should be lower multiples
[31:40] and you want to look for things that
[31:41] have been left for dead and that money
[31:44] needs to shift from those names if
[31:45] there's any bad news in the mag 7 this
[31:48] rotation will continue obviously the
[31:49] market will remain kind of around the
[31:52] unchanged to down on the year while this
[31:55] rotation goes on but I think you as
[31:57] investors you need to kind of pay
[31:58] attention to what's going to happen over
[32:00] the next four years I think this
[32:01] rotation is real Eric Schmidt um did
[32:04] this interview at Stanford he was
[32:07] speaking in front of a class and if you
[32:09] haven't heard it I'm going to bring it
[32:10] up again I brought it up uh on videos a
[32:13] long time ago but in particular I want
[32:15] you to read this if Tik Tok is banned
[32:16] say to your llm make me a copy of Tik
[32:19] Tok steal all the users steal all the
[32:20] music put my preferences in it produce
[32:22] this program in the next 30 seconds
[32:24] that's the
[32:25] command that is where we are so if you
[32:28] haven't used cursor if you haven't used
[32:29] repet we can't do everything here yet
[32:32] but the reason that it's starting to
[32:34] become hard for technology we're
[32:36] entering the physical world AI cannot
[32:39] replace the physical world it cannot
[32:42] replace copper it cannot replace oil yes
[32:44] they will eventually have an impact but
[32:46] that's what we're entering into is the
[32:48] physical world and the virtual world are
[32:50] merging and any software is up for
[32:52] competition as AI gets better and better
[32:54] so looking out three years if Tik Tok is
[32:57] banned say to your llm this is already
[33:00] here it may not be able to do all of
[33:02] this yet but with the agents coming and
[33:04] this stuff accelerating to the PACE that
[33:06] it is you have no ability to build a
[33:09] Moote around your company so if you're a
[33:11] really big company you're at risk for
[33:14] getting under pressure and I think
[33:15] that's what's being built in it's not
[33:17] now but the multiples going forward yes
[33:19] so here's CRM this is sales force so
[33:22] again in the technology side they have
[33:24] good news their Peak actually happens on
[33:26] earnings news
[33:28] they fall down they get a bounce back up
[33:30] and now they've just broken down they
[33:32] went back to the 200 day they're going
[33:33] lower there's another one where anything
[33:36] that's a software big software company
[33:38] even though they've already made inroads
[33:39] into other companies they're trying to
[33:41] get their AI agents this was supposed to
[33:43] be a big AI agent theme for this year in
[33:45] terms of one of the companies and it's
[33:47] not happening and part of the reason is
[33:49] here's where their multiple was they
[33:51] were in the 30s so again this whole
[33:53] multiple thing and then down here Cisco
[33:56] another boring company uh sitting near
[33:58] all-time highs continues to outperform
[34:01] does Cyber is involved in the data
[34:03] centers they're just trading at a at at
[34:05] a multiple they're in the hardware side
[34:07] they're in a completely different thing
[34:09] than this software thing of being uh
[34:12] comp having it out there's so many
[34:14] things wrong with a 30 multiple versus
[34:16] 15 right now in a world of AI that I
[34:19] think this new regime is starting to to
[34:21] make the bar really high for high
[34:23] multiples it's the other reason why the
[34:25] Dax which has obviously gone from you
[34:27] know a 13 PE here if you're going to say
[34:30] Hardware is going to improve that we
[34:31] need water cooling systems from seens if
[34:34] we're going to do a data center build
[34:35] out whatever it is you're getting this
[34:38] multiple thing and they don't have any
[34:40] technology names to make them you know
[34:42] Under Pressure so if you're in a country
[34:45] that hasn't won the technology battle
[34:47] the US won the technology battle not
[34:49] having that is creating a situation now
[34:52] again the mag 7 will continue to be able
[34:54] to make money this is not some Doom and
[34:56] Gloom picture on them
[34:58] uh I'm sure they are I just don't think
[34:59] regardless of what their earnings are
[35:01] unless there's a massive shock that
[35:02] they're going to go back to the
[35:03] multiples they were they'll find a
[35:05] bottom at some point and when the Tariff
[35:07] shift you you'll make a bottom
[35:09] correlated with it for now is still
[35:11] Bitcoin bitcoin's acted better than the
[35:13] S&P and this it's still the same trade
[35:16] at this point meaning until the mag s
[35:18] stopped going down this thing is going
[35:20] to be under pressure but as I've talked
[35:21] about my favorite trade for this year is
[35:23] long Bitcoin short to mag 7 I still
[35:24] think that's going to work out I would
[35:26] continue to focus there gold is
[35:28] highlighting to you that the uncertainty
[35:31] will remain this has gone parabolic here
[35:34] uh in in many ways it's faster than
[35:36] anything that happened during 09 in
[35:38] terms of the the the speed this has just
[35:40] gone parabolic and when you get this
[35:42] kind of a move in gold in a short amount
[35:44] of time where it's
[35:46] 50% it means there's uncertainty out
[35:48] there and I think this is going to
[35:50] remain uh going forward the only other
[35:51] thing I wanted to finish with uh there
[35:53] was I've talked about stable coins being
[35:55] a very important thing for the network
[35:58] effects this year uh which will benefit
[36:01] Bitcoin I continue to believe of all the
[36:03] technology names that you want to look
[36:05] at the only one that has a moat in my
[36:08] opinion is Bitcoin when we come out of
[36:10] this period which could happen at any
[36:12] time the one thing that is uh usual when
[36:14] you have the sentiment this bad I think
[36:17] you have to H you have to expect a low
[36:19] to come in a sustainable low with in the
[36:22] next few weeks it could happen on Monday
[36:24] it could happen after tariffs come out
[36:26] it could happen on a bad earning report
[36:28] but at some point here I expect a low
[36:30] that's going to last for at least a few
[36:32] months because when you get the
[36:33] sentiment this bearish and you get
[36:35] people this out you're near or low so
[36:37] I'd be looking to buy Bitcoin uh way
[36:39] over any of the tech names if you're
[36:41] trying to pick a bottom that's it for
[36:43] this week uh I will see you guys uh next
[36:45] week
