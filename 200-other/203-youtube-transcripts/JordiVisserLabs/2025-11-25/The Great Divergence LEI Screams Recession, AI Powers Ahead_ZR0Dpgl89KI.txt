--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Uh time to get going. Uh you guys can
[00:03] read through these on your own.
[00:11] All right. So just to start off, we get
[00:13] the ceasefire and obviously uh with
[00:16] people worried that leads to uh a move
[00:19] higher this week. And as we're basically
[00:23] going through it, I thought this was a
[00:24] great line from Lynn Alden because
[00:27] uh trying to call the top on structural
[00:29] bull markets rather than go to therapy.
[00:31] That's why I basically believe we are at
[00:34] a stage in the market where we're going
[00:36] to get more bearish stuff coming out
[00:39] soon. But for the time being, there's no
[00:41] way to refute that. We had this
[00:43] correction here in 2022 on the back of
[00:46] rates where everyone worried about a
[00:48] recession. Then we had the tariff fall
[00:52] uh and rally back to new all-time highs,
[00:55] which we obviously did here. It took a
[00:57] long time. This one took no time to
[00:58] fall, no time to rally, but breaking
[01:00] all-time highs. Uh a lot of the reasons
[01:04] that people were worried have not
[01:05] changed. We haven't signed any
[01:07] agreements. Uh the economy is slowing.
[01:10] There's still plenty of reasons to be
[01:12] bearish. So, we will have the next
[01:13] phase. I'm going to hopefully take you
[01:16] through again another element of what's
[01:18] driving this market and why AI is in a
[01:20] very very important stage right now. Uh
[01:22] the NDX made new all-time highs.
[01:26] Small caps continue to underperform. Uh
[01:28] have not yet broken out and again I
[01:32] think they will continue to lag uh the
[01:36] larger companies
[01:39] because of AI. The breath of the market,
[01:42] you're going to hear this as a negative.
[01:43] Right now, we only have 45% of the
[01:45] Russell 3000
[01:47] uh above the 200 day moving average.
[01:51] It bottomed down around 15%. I showed
[01:54] this chart back then. I had these two
[01:55] lines because every single time we had
[01:57] gone below this and gone up, it had gone
[01:59] through it. I'm not going to go through
[02:00] a lot of this, but basically people are
[02:02] being forced into the market. And I
[02:03] think this was another week where people
[02:05] were basically
[02:07] being forced in, but into a concentrated
[02:10] market. uh 52- week highs as we make new
[02:14] all-time highs. The percentage of of
[02:17] companies in the in the S&P 1500, it's
[02:20] small. There's not a lot of new highs
[02:22] being set. This is being driven again by
[02:25] a parabolic move in the AI trade as
[02:27] people who got knocked out or
[02:29] consolidated during the Nvidia time. So,
[02:32] Nvidia peaked around here. We
[02:34] consolidated and now we're breaking
[02:36] higher as people are jumping back on
[02:38] realizing that AI trade is still on and
[02:41] you're getting a broadening out this
[02:43] week. We got Micron. I've talked about
[02:44] Micron. I still think it's going higher,
[02:46] higher, higher uh as we move into the
[02:49] embodiment stage, which we have not done
[02:51] yet. We're in there's about one out in
[02:54] the first inning of the embodiment
[02:55] stage. Uh which is the reasoning part.
[02:58] Uh memory is the key in the AI age.
[03:03] completely agree. Semiconductors are
[03:05] leading the way. This is over the last
[03:07] 10 years. This is so stocks over the NDX
[03:10] for the quarter. Um so a massive move
[03:13] higher of outperformance
[03:15] uh semis over software is leading us
[03:18] higher and I believe that's going to be
[03:19] this the the case. This is not driven by
[03:22] the mag 7 uh completely. You obviously
[03:25] have some of them up now. Believe it or
[03:27] not year to date Nvidia is up 17%,
[03:30] Microsoft's up 17. Meta's up 25, but
[03:33] Alphabet, Apple, Tesla down, Amazon
[03:36] unchanged. This is not the Mag 7 this
[03:39] time. There's a lot of uh winners and
[03:42] losers. And I think this is the AI side,
[03:44] and I've talked about it before. I do
[03:45] not expect the Mag 7 to be the place to
[03:47] be. Uh Nvidia's now had a big run. I
[03:50] still think Nvidia will be fine, but I
[03:51] think you're going to keep running into
[03:53] these problems with these companies uh
[03:55] every now and then as uh they're just
[03:57] not getting the revenue in they need.
[03:59] That being said, do not short them. Uh,
[04:03] Atlanta Fed GDP. Now, remember, we've
[04:06] now had a negative.5% in the first
[04:08] quarter. We're supposed to see a large
[04:10] bounce back in the second. This is now
[04:12] going down down to uh below 3%. So,
[04:15] you're talking about sub
[04:18] uh 2% growth in the first half uh
[04:21] combined uh which means things are on
[04:23] the weaker side. and tenure rates.
[04:25] Remember up here when we were in the
[04:27] trust moment uh just like on the
[04:29] liberation day moment just like the Iran
[04:32] Israel there's been there's constant
[04:34] worries that just keep entering because
[04:36] people don't want to believe this. I'll
[04:38] go through the reasons why trust moment
[04:40] we've just gone back down to four and a
[04:42] quarter. Most importantly we're still in
[04:44] a 2-year range between for the most part
[04:48] four and four and 3/4 with slight breaks
[04:50] below. Uh but for the most part we're
[04:52] sitting there. We're now at 91% 92% for
[04:56] a Fed cut uh in September. I will remind
[05:00] you something. Cuts during times where
[05:03] we are not in a recession are extremely
[05:05] bullish for stocks. Uh we are not going
[05:08] to have a recession. Uh the dollar
[05:10] continues to weaken as it broke down
[05:11] again. So everyone trying to pick the
[05:13] bottom of the dollar. Uh this is a
[05:16] structural problem uh that to me will
[05:19] take time. It's overowned. Uh I think
[05:22] that's a much better trade as I've said
[05:23] than the equities. I think the dollar
[05:26] for a whole host of reasons including
[05:28] the democratization of AI including the
[05:30] fact that the US uh capitalist uh
[05:34] approach is breaking down uh and it's
[05:37] becoming something more as I'll go
[05:38] through where the system is breaking and
[05:41] the global reserve currency status
[05:43] everything is just kind of breaking down
[05:44] because they're they have to deal with
[05:46] the median voter in the country and
[05:48] their situation continues to worsen and
[05:50] I think will get worse as time goes on.
[05:53] Uh so the dollar just continues to
[05:55] weaken with no bounce. Uh to start off a
[05:58] year, every single month has been down
[06:01] now as we get to the end of June. That
[06:02] has not happened. I I don't know when or
[06:05] if it's it's happened. Uh but to have
[06:08] six months down in a row is a difficult
[06:10] thing as it is. The last time we had it
[06:13] was in here and you can see there were a
[06:14] couple months that it did move. So this
[06:16] is a persistent pervasive pronounced
[06:18] decline in the dollar. This is not
[06:20] something minor and it continues. Where
[06:22] I want to segue now is just why the
[06:24] recession talk is going to continue
[06:27] because we do have a recession in
[06:29] anything not related to AI. Uh so if it
[06:33] wasn't for artificial intelligence, if
[06:35] it wasn't for exponential innovation and
[06:38] the mag 7, we would be in a recession
[06:40] meaning if the digital economy didn't
[06:42] exist. So the LEI uh is something I just
[06:45] want to highlight. Uh, I put this line
[06:48] in here and what you can see, this is
[06:49] the year-over-year LEI. We have now been
[06:52] negative for 35 months in a row. We went
[06:54] negative right here. It's been 35 months
[06:58] in a row that we've been in negative
[06:59] territory. It's been 34 months that
[07:02] we've been below this line here, which
[07:03] is the minus 1% line. Every single time
[07:08] that we've been below in this area, it
[07:10] was a given that we were going into a
[07:12] recession. At this level, we were
[07:15] supposed to be in a recession. So, it's
[07:17] not just that we were supposed to hit a
[07:18] recession or be in one. We haven't had
[07:21] there hasn't even been a a hint of it
[07:24] other than the fact that we had those
[07:25] two quarters of negative GDP in 22 when
[07:27] we hired 4 million people that year on
[07:29] the job side where I've said repeatedly
[07:31] and for those of you who uh either don't
[07:34] watch me all the time or go through it,
[07:36] the job market will be weak by AI, there
[07:39] is absolutely no doubt about it. At the
[07:41] same time, anyone can go get a job. You
[07:44] can get a job if you want one. The
[07:46] question is, will you accept the pay
[07:48] that you're going to get if you lose a
[07:50] job in one white collar business and you
[07:52] have to go work doing Door Dash or go to
[07:55] Dunkin Donuts? There are plenty of jobs
[07:57] out there. We have a labor shortage. The
[08:00] problem is the areas that we have a
[08:02] labor shortage are very different than
[08:04] the places where people are getting laid
[08:05] off. And that's the issue that's going
[08:07] to come. What I have here is we're in a
[08:09] level at this point, which is the
[08:11] year-over-year job creation. So, this is
[08:14] the non-farm payrolls. We're currently
[08:16] at 1.08%.
[08:18] That line there, we've never been this
[08:20] low and
[08:22] not been in a recession already. So, 1%
[08:26] figure that's about 1.6 million people
[08:28] that have been hired over the course of
[08:30] the last year, which means that's about
[08:32] 100 uh about 115,000
[08:36] somewhere in there. uh what you're
[08:38] dealing with at this point is that we're
[08:41] not creating many jobs and as I showed
[08:42] you outside of health care and travel
[08:45] and leisure the number is right now
[08:47] 30,000 a month except for those two
[08:49] sectors uh which are government
[08:51] subsidized through Medicare, Medicaid
[08:53] and social security. Uh but otherwise
[08:56] the jobs market's in a recession. The
[08:58] reason this is important is if you go
[09:00] back to the LEI and I don't know how
[09:01] many people actually understand when it
[09:03] was created, what went on, but this was
[09:05] created in the 1950s and60s by Jeffrey
[09:07] Moore, uh I spent a lot of time with
[09:10] ECRI work. I built my own models in the
[09:13] same time using asset classes when I was
[09:15] in Brazil in 97. I used them throughout
[09:17] uh the hedge fund time when I managed
[09:19] money as a forecasting tool for when a
[09:22] recession was coming. In the LEI, it's
[09:25] very broad. So you've got manufacturing
[09:29] hours worked. You've got initial claims
[09:31] for unemployment. So this is the jobs
[09:33] portion. Uh both of these at this point
[09:35] have been weakening. You've got new
[09:37] orders weakening. New orders weakening.
[09:39] New orders weakening. Building permits
[09:41] in the housing side weakening. Let's
[09:43] skip this one and this one. Yield curve
[09:46] obviously been screaming recession for a
[09:48] while. And consumer confidence shocking
[09:51] where we are in consumer confidence for
[09:53] anything at this point. All of those
[09:56] suggest there's a recession. What
[09:57] doesn't is the S&P 500 because I'm going
[09:59] to say credit is completely driven by
[10:01] the S&P 500. So think about it. The
[10:03] economy is in recession which means
[10:05] people are suffering on all elements and
[10:09] right now of the earnings growth of the
[10:11] S&P it gets isolated to seven companies.
[10:14] So the MAG 7 right now we hear that
[10:16] they're 30% of the market cap. Well
[10:19] here's where you take the market cap uh
[10:22] weighted earnings per share. 55% of the
[10:25] earnings of the S&P 500 growth. So
[10:29] basically seven companies are winning
[10:31] and this is where you can see the profit
[10:32] margins for those seven companies and
[10:34] here's the profit margins for the
[10:36] companies that are not part same same
[10:38] level as 2018 while up here we've had a
[10:41] huge boom. So the mag seven is driving
[10:44] everything and that's why people feel
[10:45] the pain when you take it to revenues
[10:47] and the growth rate. Forget the past
[10:49] here. This is what's forecasted now or
[10:52] this is what happened going in. This is
[10:54] what's still forecasted. So you have
[10:56] revenue growth for the MAG 7
[11:00] still coming in at this point at 10%.
[11:02] While the rest of the S&P X that which
[11:06] is the green um sorry is the uh the red
[11:09] you're coming in at three and change
[11:12] maybe four if come through less than
[11:15] five. basically at nominal GDP or less.
[11:18] Historically, the S&P 500 would get
[11:21] earnings uh revenue growth that would be
[11:23] a multiple of nominal GDP by about 1 and
[11:26] a half. So, if you had 5% like we do
[11:28] now, you'd expecting 7% revenues. This
[11:31] is why everyone feels there's a
[11:33] recession. The only companies that are
[11:35] generating revenues that feel like
[11:38] growth are the ones who are not hiring
[11:41] anyone right now. And so here is the
[11:44] profit margin numbers. Same story. The
[11:47] red line here will be the S&P
[11:50] 493. Just look at the discrepancy
[11:53] between them. These are massive
[11:54] differences between the MAG 7. The Mag 7
[11:57] have been benefiting. That's the digital
[11:59] economy. They own it. It's global. It's
[12:01] why foreign stocks have underperformed.
[12:03] If you are betting on Europe to
[12:05] outperform the US continuously, forget
[12:07] the currency for a second where I
[12:08] completely agree, but you're betting on
[12:10] the MAG7 to underperform
[12:13] those countries at this point. I do
[12:15] think over time that'll happen because I
[12:17] think AI is democratizing, but you're in
[12:19] there. The sentiment to slack at the end
[12:21] of the year,
[12:23] the reality is high and growing
[12:25] concentration continues to be a major
[12:27] problem. It is not a major problem other
[12:29] than the fact that it's hurting the
[12:30] economy and creating this problem. And
[12:32] this is before we get into the most
[12:35] powerful force yet. We have not entered
[12:38] AI. All we've done is the simple chatbot
[12:41] part, the stuff that has not been used
[12:42] by the workforce. Now we're entering
[12:44] inference, reasoning, uh conscious
[12:47] deliberation, anything any any way you
[12:50] want to call it. We're entering the part
[12:51] where we're starting to have AI agents
[12:53] and behind that is robotics as I'll get
[12:56] through. So this is only going to get
[12:58] worse. That's why I keep saying do not
[13:01] underestimate how bad things are going
[13:03] to get in terms of the way people feel
[13:05] without a recession. Uh imagine world
[13:07] where machines not only perform physical
[13:09] labor but also think, learn, and make
[13:11] autonomous decisions. The world includes
[13:13] humans in the loop. Bringing people and
[13:15] machines together in a state of super
[13:16] agency that increases personal
[13:18] productivity and creativity. This is the
[13:20] transformative potential of AI, a
[13:22] technology with potential impact poised
[13:24] to express even the biggest innovations
[13:26] in the past. It doesn't matter what the
[13:29] innovation was. There's nothing to
[13:30] compare this to. So, do not doubt it. Do
[13:33] not fade it. Try to figure out how to
[13:35] make money off it. And just remember,
[13:37] the LEI is the short. The long is AI. As
[13:41] I go through this, I want you to keep
[13:42] remembering that if your brain is
[13:45] fixated on the LEI and the data of the
[13:47] past, you need therapy. That is the
[13:50] reality. You have to focus your stuff.
[13:51] And now I can see that people are being
[13:53] forced into it because asset managers
[13:56] are forced to make money and if a
[13:58] recession doesn't happen, they have to
[14:00] get more into AI. But the problem is,
[14:02] can they do it? Uh this is the
[14:05] percentage of firms planning on using AI
[14:08] ramping. So again, this is all starting
[14:11] now with reasoning. Reasoning is the
[14:13] most important part. But of course, uh
[14:16] we will now start fixating again on
[14:18] tariffs. We'll start fixating again on
[14:20] Fed independence. Everything will start
[14:22] coming and we'll get some new bearish
[14:24] thing whether it's a recession or not.
[14:26] But they did say the tariff deadline is
[14:28] not critical.
[14:30] Walking back a little bit again. Uh but
[14:33] as to points out uh has Trump outsmarted
[14:37] everyone on tariffs because he is
[14:39] getting the tariffs um and nothing's
[14:43] happening to the market. So he was able
[14:45] to get to the point where
[14:47] 400 billion of annual revenue for
[14:49] taxpayers is something that he wanted to
[14:52] get. And if he can keep 30% and 10% on
[14:55] all countries and then give all
[14:57] countries 12 months to lower just keep
[14:59] rolling back the adjustment
[15:03] in aggregate, then he's going to get
[15:05] what he wants and be able to still have
[15:07] people on edge uh and threaten more and
[15:11] more. This week was a big week for Trump
[15:14] going after Pal. This one was even
[15:16] higher, I would say, than the prior ones
[15:18] because now we're getting into a bigger
[15:20] thing. Naming next Fed chair early and
[15:23] bid to undermine PAL and have a shadow
[15:25] Fed.
[15:27] Uh so you get markets to protest if Fed
[15:30] independence at risk and what would
[15:34] happen? Uh, I'm sure they would, you
[15:37] know, be angry for a little bit of time,
[15:40] but again, I think we're heading to a a
[15:43] point where as you're watching
[15:44] everything, whether it's tariffs, the
[15:46] market responded to that, it meant
[15:48] nothing. Recession fears it respond to
[15:50] that. Donald Trump is in there to
[15:52] disrupt. He is trying to disrupt and
[15:55] every time that we get negative and
[15:56] start extrapolating things uh on
[15:58] anything. I mean it was just last
[16:00] weekend that the bunker bombs were in
[16:02] there and the talk over the weekend was
[16:04] that oil would end up spiking to over
[16:06] 100 to start off the day. So I think the
[16:08] market just keeps responding to things
[16:10] and not realizing that this is a process
[16:13] that's in place. Capitalism the way we
[16:16] know it is under attack and the global
[16:18] reserve currency of the dollar and the
[16:20] what it's been in the past we are having
[16:21] a completely different world and AI is
[16:23] forcing it innovation is forcing it
[16:26] because the voters are not happy
[16:28] treasuries rally dollar slumps as Trump
[16:30] buys pal's successor
[16:33] gets back into why the dollar was
[16:35] weakening um just I'm bringing this up I
[16:39] want you to keep track of this name Py
[16:42] Py because uh he's going to be the one I
[16:45] think is getting more and more press as
[16:47] we need to figure out a way to deal with
[16:50] the anger of the people. Jobs is one
[16:52] thing. The ability to find affordable
[16:54] housing is another. Rates, rates, rates.
[16:57] I believe we need to begin lowering
[17:00] rates so that Americans can see relief
[17:01] in their daily finances. Obviously,
[17:03] Trump has talked about it from saving
[17:04] the country money because of the
[17:06] interest expense. Pi is right. Pal's
[17:09] refusal to cut rates is economic
[17:11] malpractice. The 4 and a.5% rate
[17:13] strangle hold is crushing home buyers,
[17:14] trapping owners in low rate mortgages,
[17:16] and fueling a housing supply crisis,
[17:19] which is true. Trump says he thinks the
[17:22] Fed should set interest rates at 1%.
[17:25] This was late on Friday uh that this uh
[17:28] he basically said this. Uh I I don't
[17:31] know if he's serious. Uh but he is again
[17:34] going on this. But I just want you to
[17:36] think Trump says he thinks Fed should
[17:38] set interest rates at 1%. He also said
[17:42] uh I've instructed my people not to do
[17:44] any debt beyond nine months or so.
[17:47] You're really talking about
[17:50] uh some form of uh
[17:54] printing. Uh we'll just see what goes
[17:56] on. But running things of the basement
[17:58] and moving rates lower to run them hot
[18:00] and grow your way out is what the game
[18:02] plan is. So obviously um
[18:06] we've got this uh for New York City. So
[18:10] let's just go through um the prospect of
[18:14] the capital of capitalism going
[18:16] socialist poses a challenge for those
[18:18] who want to see New York City prosper. I
[18:22] viewing this as just a major statement
[18:25] by voters again that fit into this.
[18:28] Peter Teal on why 70% of millennials say
[18:31] they are pro-socialist.
[18:34] When one has too much student debt or if
[18:36] housing is too unaffordable, then one
[18:38] will have negative capital for a long
[18:40] time. And if no one has a stake in the
[18:42] capitalist system, then one may well
[18:44] turn against it. The other thing that is
[18:46] missing from here is the fact that the
[18:49] jobs market is horrific for young
[18:52] people. Uh the corporate ladder has been
[18:55] destroyed and this is all before AI is
[18:57] coming. This has been happening. But
[19:00] when you have debt to start off your
[19:01] life, housing is too unaffordable, and
[19:04] you can't get a job to make enough
[19:05] money, you're really in an angry
[19:09] position. And when it happens with the
[19:10] younger generation, you're dealing with
[19:13] people just graduating college. Uh, and
[19:16] I hear from them, I hear from their
[19:17] parents, it is a problem. Uh, and that's
[19:21] where we're at. And this has just
[19:22] started. So when you see things like
[19:24] this where they haven't hired and you
[19:26] have people from the again lei world
[19:30] I'll call them this was Torston Sllock
[19:33] saying this is because the Fed starts
[19:34] raising interest rates. These companies
[19:36] are growing revenues at exceptionally
[19:40] high levels and they are not hiring for
[19:42] the first time. Until people start
[19:44] realizing AI's damage that is happening
[19:47] it will be a problem. I wrote about this
[19:50] and said, "This growing tension won't
[19:52] just affect workers. It will force major
[19:54] shifts in both fiscal and monetary
[19:56] policy as governments and central banks
[19:58] grapple with how to support displaced
[20:00] labor, maintain economic stability, and
[20:02] respond to a world where productivity
[20:04] rises without broad-based employment."
[20:06] This is it. I wrote this because
[20:10] everything that I'm going through right
[20:11] now on this week's video is about the
[20:14] tension happening between monetary
[20:16] policy, fiscal policy, think the
[20:18] beautiful tax bill, think Powell, think
[20:21] the jobs uh market in terms of not
[20:23] hiring. This is something that has been
[20:25] happening and going, but now the pace of
[20:27] innovation is speeding up and it's about
[20:30] to go parabolic. the AI situation,
[20:33] machine learning has been around for a
[20:35] long time, but bringing chatbt out to
[20:38] every single company and now getting
[20:39] into the reasoning and thinking and
[20:42] conscious deliberation side where it's
[20:44] going to be connected to machines and
[20:45] digital agents. This is only going to
[20:48] get worse. I have no idea how bad the
[20:51] unemployment situation will be. Um, my
[20:53] guess is is that it won't be as bad as
[20:56] what the worst people are saying, but I
[20:58] definitely believe that it is having an
[21:00] impact. If not only psychologically, it
[21:03] will make people fear things. Um, this
[21:05] is the housing situation just to show
[21:07] how far above we are in terms of the
[21:09] cost of housing. So, jobs markets we can
[21:12] comment. Luke Groman put this out and
[21:15] basically, you know, it it's the same
[21:17] thing. Uh, New York City's biggest banks
[21:20] are too big to fail. And when too big to
[21:22] fill, bank capital is mandated to hold
[21:24] government debt instead of gold.
[21:26] Socialism. Um, we're just in this
[21:29] predicament right now and they're trying
[21:30] to find some way. So I wrote I talked
[21:32] about uh Joseph Schumper last week and I
[21:35] used his line uh that was implied in one
[21:38] of his books that at some point when
[21:40] innovation speeds up so fast driven by
[21:42] capitalism uh and printing money and
[21:45] allowing things to grow at a very rapid
[21:47] pace, you end up with a massive
[21:49] distribution of wealth problem which is
[21:51] what we have. And then eventually
[21:52] cannibalism,
[21:54] capitalism cannibalizes itself through
[21:57] the fact that it doesn't actually need
[21:59] any more jobs. And so creative
[22:02] destruction, the process where new
[22:04] entrepreneurial innovations arise and
[22:06] subsequently cause the old way of doing
[22:07] things to disappear. Again, lei
[22:10] disappear.
[22:11] Okay, robotics time. um because this is
[22:14] coming and if you haven't spent the time
[22:16] on it, which most people have not, I've
[22:18] realized that as I'm planning a uh very
[22:21] important uh conversation uh
[22:26] about humanoids and about nuclear and
[22:29] about power. Uh Chris Camilillo, who
[22:31] I've listened to many, many times this
[22:33] year, uh probably the best voice on from
[22:36] the investor side on where we are with
[22:38] robotics and humanoids. He did this uh
[22:41] interview this week. I highly recommend
[22:44] listening to it. The highlights. Uh
[22:47] Chris declares AI is everything
[22:49] comparing its importance to the arrival
[22:50] of the internet. If businesses or
[22:53] individuals don't adopt AIO tools now,
[22:55] they will fall behind. If you're not
[22:57] using it, you're done. The three skills
[22:59] need stand out. Resourcefulness,
[23:00] learning, agility, create creative
[23:02] application. These take time. You have
[23:05] to use it every single day, multiple
[23:07] times. Company leaders, let your people
[23:10] use the LLMs. keep your data separately.
[23:12] Use it uh using it for spotting trends
[23:17] and doing stuff. It's a starting point
[23:18] for research. Cannot agree more. As I've
[23:20] highlighted, I I've replaced Bloomberg
[23:23] with that function with perplexity. Uh
[23:25] the robot revolution is within 5 years.
[23:27] This is not something way down the road.
[23:30] This is something that is today. It's
[23:32] speeding up. That's the point of where
[23:33] we are. Physical labor will be replaced.
[23:36] It's a good thing we have a shortage. AI
[23:37] will democratize intelligence and
[23:39] opportunity. AI is going AI is going to
[23:41] democratize humanity. There are so many
[23:43] benefits that come out of this, but we
[23:44] are in the 5-year period where the
[23:46] displacement will be real. His big bet,
[23:50] Nvidia and robotics, um, it's one of the
[23:53] reasons why we've talked about Nvidia so
[23:55] much on this, but semis in general, uh,
[23:57] including analog semis, which I'll go
[23:59] through. So, big week for this stuff,
[24:01] the rise of embodied AI, lots of robot
[24:03] stuff in the news. This is all from this
[24:05] week. All from this week. I'm not going
[24:07] to read them. You guys can go look them
[24:09] up on your own. You can go watch this uh
[24:11] figure AI robot video 20 minutes. Uh New
[24:16] York Times had an article on it this
[24:18] week. Uh you can see the types of people
[24:20] that are investing
[24:23] uh in this. This is not just a minor
[24:26] thing. This is a large amount of money
[24:28] that are involved in it. Nvidia's
[24:30] confirmed that their revenue in it has
[24:33] surged and it's not a small number. It's
[24:35] up to half a billion dollars uh in
[24:38] quarterly sales
[24:41] uh in May.
[24:44] Uh Jensen Yuang also endorsed Elon Musk.
[24:48] He thinks Tesla's headed for a
[24:50] multi-trillion dollar future. You have
[24:52] to think about the fact that he's
[24:53] talking about the robotics thing and
[24:56] mentioning Tesla in this. Tesla's a big
[24:58] customer, but I think it just highlights
[25:00] where Tesla is on this and where Optimus
[25:02] is. They're not being viewed as that
[25:04] yet. When that starts to happen by the
[25:05] end of the year, you'll get it. Adam
[25:07] Jonas at Morgan Stanley, one of my
[25:09] favorites, did put this piece out a few
[25:12] weeks ago, the robots are coming. I
[25:14] would go spend time reading on it. Uh,
[25:17] one of the things that stands out, he
[25:19] listed the 100 humanoid part of the
[25:23] value chain.
[25:24] 37 of them in the chain are Chinese
[25:27] companies. So, right off the bat, you're
[25:30] dealing with an Asia story, a China
[25:32] story. Uh but with inside the industrial
[25:35] chain, 73% of firms are based in Asia.
[25:39] So you're really dealing with Asia as a
[25:42] as a as an important part of this. We've
[25:45] talked about uh why Rare Earth Minerals
[25:48] stopped the trade war uh particularly
[25:50] with China. They went back to some
[25:51] agreement. If you read the local Chinese
[25:53] papers, they're saying nothing has
[25:54] changed uh with the announcement, but
[25:56] the market didn't respond to it. So,
[25:58] we're just at a point where whatever has
[26:00] happened the details, we don't know
[26:02] everything. Uh, but I'm telling you, for
[26:04] military reasons, rare earth is needed.
[26:07] If you want to go read about how Israel
[26:09] is going to build back up their Iron
[26:10] Dome, they need more rare earth. Uh,
[26:13] there there's other types of materials
[26:15] and things that are needed. It's one of
[26:17] the reasons that speculation happened as
[26:19] to why the bump bunker bombs was
[26:20] dropped. This couldn't last much longer
[26:23] because of the rare earth side. Again,
[26:25] this relationship of the globe and where
[26:27] we are in technology is the driving
[26:28] force. The lei is useless. You need to
[26:30] be focused on the main thing that shows
[26:33] up, which is AI and robotics. Tesla's
[26:36] robo taxi hit the street. This is also
[26:39] embodied AI. This is the think of this
[26:41] as a humanoid on wheels. Same type of
[26:44] need for reasoning and inference and
[26:46] learning. Whimo applies for New York
[26:49] City testing. Uh, I can only imagine the
[26:54] uh the outrage that'll happen. If you
[26:56] remember the strikes from Uber, now
[26:58] we're going to have driverless in New
[26:59] York. Uh, as Pomp said on our uh weekly
[27:03] podcast yesterday,
[27:05] there's going to be a fire of Whimo. We
[27:07] just saw them in California. That was
[27:08] from riots. I think there's I think
[27:10] we're going to be in a labor situation
[27:12] as more and more of this goes on. So,
[27:14] where are we in the humanoid robot
[27:16] investment cycle?
[27:18] So I just went through you've got
[27:19] electronic related to deep mind figure
[27:22] AI with open AI basically the types of
[27:24] people that or companies and people that
[27:26] are involved we're at a very very early
[27:30] stage uh they say late 90s for
[27:34] smartphones uh early 10s for EVs
[27:38] wherever you want to go the buildout is
[27:40] happening now and they are racing and
[27:41] raising massive amounts of capital so
[27:43] where are the alpha opportunities the
[27:45] semis obviously ly. Um, you can go
[27:48] through these on your own, but there's a
[27:49] lot of different things that go that are
[27:52] going to show up.
[27:53] Uh, Appronic, Figure AI, 1X, the bigger
[27:57] the biggest companies. We are in the pre
[27:59] iPhone moment for humanoids and we are
[28:02] accelerating much much faster than we
[28:04] were back then. Uh, the Asia story
[28:06] connected to it. I've highlighted this
[28:08] chart. It continues to drag the semis.
[28:10] The semis, this is equal weight semis,
[28:12] which gives you both the analog and the
[28:13] AI. We are rising rapidly towards the
[28:16] Cosby. The Cosby is leading again. You
[28:19] know the connection now between AI
[28:21] robotics. Uh Micron uh anticipates uh
[28:26] DRAM shortage,
[28:29] copper prices. Um this has frustrated
[28:32] people. Again, I want to emphasize the
[28:34] point of AI over LEI. So right now
[28:38] electrification is big for copper.
[28:40] Everyone's been frustrated that copper
[28:42] just never accelerates. It goes up, it
[28:43] goes down, it goes up, it goes down. If
[28:45] you want a great sharp ratio play, you
[28:47] get long AI copper. You get short old
[28:50] economy nickel. Let's just use nickel.
[28:52] Look at that beautiful sharp ratio since
[28:54] chat GPT was launched. Uh so if you get
[28:57] long copper, short nickel against it.
[28:59] Those are the types of things you have
[29:00] to do. You have to take one side of your
[29:02] brain and think how do I invest in AI?
[29:05] And then on the other side, you go I
[29:07] hate the LEI economy. I need to short
[29:10] something. Go find something to short.
[29:12] This is coming up with new pair trades,
[29:14] sharp ratios that work. As long as it's
[29:16] got the AI side to it, you're going to
[29:18] be able to go through this. This is not
[29:21] a shortage situation right now. This
[29:23] will just continue to be something
[29:25] AIdriven use cases for copper. I list
[29:28] them out here again. Chat GBT, not list
[29:30] them out. I asked Chat GBT to give me
[29:32] all the positive use cases and then give
[29:34] me all the nickel cases and then do a
[29:37] comparison. Copper is the clear winner
[29:39] for AI use cases. Data centers major
[29:41] role nickel very little. This is what
[29:44] you have to do using AI is go in and ask
[29:47] the question on whatever thing you're
[29:48] interested in. Don't tell it what to do,
[29:50] just ask it. And it says be long copper,
[29:53] short nickel if you want to be playing
[29:55] long AI. Those are the types of things
[29:57] that right now are starting to get built
[29:59] into the market more and more. The next
[30:01] one, power. I'll keep pounding the table
[30:03] on the fact that we do not have enough
[30:05] power for what is going on. Dylan Patel
[30:07] from semi analysis uh who did a great
[30:10] job at the beginning of the year kind of
[30:11] throwing this deepseek thing and just
[30:14] still talking up Nvidia the whole time.
[30:16] The weakness of the US grid isn't just
[30:18] the lack of power. It's also the lack of
[30:19] mechanism to keep it stable. I expect a
[30:21] training run to plunge hundreds of
[30:22] thousands of people into a blackout. Uh
[30:25] this will make normies anti-AI
[30:27] infrastructure. There's solutions we can
[30:29] implement though. We are going to h have
[30:32] to spend money. So what does Trump plan?
[30:36] Executive order to boost energy supply
[30:37] for AI development. He had announced the
[30:39] the nuclear side but that's not enough.
[30:42] Um this is becoming completely obvious
[30:45] to everyone that we are way behind China
[30:48] as you can see in this chart. Uh
[30:50] electricity generation 99 through here
[30:53] just continues to go higher. They are so
[30:56] far ahead and whoever wins the energy
[30:58] battle wins the AI battle. So, you are
[31:00] going to have massive
[31:02] dollars spent on the power side. And so,
[31:05] what does that mean? Again, I wrote a
[31:06] Chevron Exxon piece. You have to think
[31:08] outside the box. You have to go find
[31:10] things that will work. Uh you're going
[31:12] to have to pay attention to everything
[31:15] that could possibly keep us up with
[31:16] China over the course of the next few
[31:18] years. All right. Now, for the big shift
[31:20] and kind of let's take everything that
[31:22] we did today. Uh we've got
[31:24] concentration. AI is driving
[31:26] concentration. So less winners, fewer
[31:29] jobs created by the winning firms. So as
[31:31] these ones get bigger and bigger,
[31:32] they're not uh adding headcount. That
[31:35] means labor is losing to capital,
[31:37] deepening the wealth inequality and
[31:39] causing economic resentment and
[31:41] socialism to rise.
[31:44] A president is elected to address
[31:46] economic pain. That's Donald Trump was
[31:50] elected and he's still trying to help
[31:51] the median voter. So the housing stuff,
[31:53] anything to move lower rates, the debt
[31:56] is too large to sustain high rates. So
[31:58] they have to debase, they have to
[31:59] inflate their way out or grow their way
[32:02] above interest rates. So they need
[32:03] nominal GDP to be above it. So if we
[32:05] move rates to 1%, the question is how
[32:08] high of the inflation. That is the bet
[32:10] that I would be making as well. uh the
[32:12] dollar will weaken, but the inflation
[32:14] side at this point has every sign that
[32:16] it's under under control and AI is going
[32:19] to be an incredibly deflationary force
[32:21] over the course of the next 5 years,
[32:23] particularly as label and wages are
[32:24] under pressure. So what happens? You got
[32:27] tensions between the Fed, monetary and
[32:29] fiscal policy at odds. Global leaders no
[32:32] longer want the dollar as a reserve
[32:33] currency.
[32:35] So what starts to become it? Crypto
[32:38] gains political champion. So the leaders
[32:42] of the US are now pro- crypto and stable
[32:45] coins start to rise as a bridge
[32:47] currency.
[32:48] I'm going to repeat the death of
[32:51] capitalism. So that's where we are with
[32:54] robotics coming and everything. This is
[32:56] the official ending. You can doubt it.
[32:58] You can keep going. The global reserve
[33:00] currency and then I just went through a
[33:02] list of 10 things. They all argue for
[33:04] being along this. This has consolidated
[33:07] now near the prior highs. I think this
[33:09] thing is about to explode. Here's five
[33:12] waves up, consolidation. It's just a
[33:15] question of when. And again, I think it
[33:17] will be driven by an expansion in
[33:19] crypto, but also Friday was expiration,
[33:23] uh, the big expiration for Bitcoin. So
[33:25] all of that gamma that had been pounded
[33:27] on the market and helped draw volatility
[33:29] low that every time we tried to break
[33:31] out, it got sucked back down except for
[33:33] this one little move lower uh intra over
[33:36] the weekend on the back of the bunker
[33:38] bombs. We've been consolidating on
[33:40] Ethereum. Ethereum needs to go higher.
[33:42] As I highlighted last week, I don't
[33:44] think we can have the type of move I'm
[33:46] expecting in Bitcoin without Ethereum
[33:48] and Salana to go higher. Uh here's the
[33:50] Salana chart again, five waves up,
[33:53] corrective move there. impulsive,
[33:55] corrective, the next move should be
[33:56] higher and if it is, this will be a
[33:58] third wave of some uh level. Uh it's
[34:01] already happening inside the traditional
[34:03] finance world. Coinbase shares uh hit
[34:06] first record since 2021. So since before
[34:10] the chaos of 2022
[34:13] uh which we have not taken out yet for
[34:16] the prior uh for most of the altcoins.
[34:19] The big thing is Circle had the IPO.
[34:21] It's obviously gone through the roof. If
[34:23] you had Coinbase going higher, crypto
[34:25] mining stocks surged this week in
[34:27] takeover rumors from uh from Coree for
[34:30] Core uh Core Scientific. If you still
[34:34] need to have a retail explanation for
[34:38] why you should have an allocation, and
[34:40] this is mainly for retail at this point
[34:42] or high netw worth individuals, I
[34:44] thought this guy did a great job. Uh, I
[34:47] believe he's got an RAIA,
[34:50] but he talked Rick Edlman on this
[34:52] particular podcast about all the reasons
[34:54] to be longing it. And I thought he did a
[34:56] very, very good job. Uh, and it's not be
[34:59] long it, he's saying you should have
[35:01] somewhere between a 10 to 40% allocation
[35:04] in crypto. Uh, and he goes through the
[35:08] six reasons. It's a new asset class,
[35:10] monetary debasement, which I've covered.
[35:11] All these things I will have covered at
[35:13] some point in here. uh institutional
[35:16] adoption is happening. Tokenization will
[35:18] be a massive part of this. Everything
[35:20] will be tokenized. Uh there's no doubt
[35:23] about it. So that's coming. It's already
[35:25] started. The demographic shift as the
[35:28] money is transferred down. Young people
[35:30] believe in crypto. Older people, wealthy
[35:33] people do not. As the money is
[35:34] transferred, you will have it. And we're
[35:36] in the network effects, which I talk
[35:37] about all the time for this. Uh, and so
[35:42] he just highlights, you know,
[35:43] conservatives should have 1 to5,
[35:45] moderate should have 5 to 10. He also
[35:47] brings up a point that I've brought up
[35:49] before, which is if you're in your 60s,
[35:52] uh, and you don't realize that you're
[35:53] going to live far longer than you
[35:55] imagine because of AI again, you need to
[35:58] have riskier things that will be
[35:59] dominating in 10 years. Bitcoin may not
[36:02] go up to the levels I think this year.
[36:05] Uh, there's no way to stop those trends
[36:07] that I showed because AI will continue
[36:08] to make the situation worse. It is the
[36:10] fuel behind Bitcoin. It is the fuel
[36:13] behind crypto. Getting back to the 1%
[36:16] thing that Trump mentioned, he doesn't
[36:18] realize it, but that's maybe the most
[36:20] MMT modern monetary theory statement
[36:22] I've ever heard again. How do you print
[36:24] money? You have to grow nominal GDP
[36:27] above interest rates. If we can have 5%
[36:29] nominal GDP and we can have 1% interest
[36:32] rates, they can grow their way out of
[36:34] the debt problem. Uh, and that's going
[36:36] to be basically where they're going to
[36:37] try. It seems like even if it's a new
[36:40] Fed person, not until Pal leaves, he's
[36:43] only going to hire someone that's going
[36:44] to look. Trump did speak. Bitcoin
[36:46] reduces dollar pressure. These are all
[36:48] part So, Bitcoin is part of the plan,
[36:51] which means it should be part of the
[36:52] investment portfolio. This again, I'm
[36:55] I'm mentioning this because there's this
[36:56] PY guy again. Uh, US Fed Housing Finance
[37:00] Agency order orders Fanny and Freddy. If
[37:02] you just type Fanny and Freddy into X
[37:05] this week, you're going to get a lot of
[37:07] stuff. I've been speculating that
[37:08] they'll figure out some way to get
[37:10] housing in there. Well, the first thing
[37:11] is they're going to count Bitcoin and
[37:13] crypto as an asset when assessing
[37:15] mortgage eligibility. So, now you can
[37:18] actually use them. That will help people
[37:20] to belong. House plan single vote to
[37:22] move genius and clarity crypto bills.
[37:25] We're still moving forward with that.
[37:27] And then finally for this week, uh
[37:30] Mastercard partner to allow three
[37:32] billion holders to buy crypto. Uh I
[37:35] don't know if I'll do a video next week
[37:37] because of July 4th. We'll see if there
[37:40] is large movements. Uh maybe I'll do a
[37:42] short one just to kind of highlight uh
[37:44] the second half of the year. We'll see.
[37:46] Uh but that's it for this week. Thanks.
[37:48] See you next week.
