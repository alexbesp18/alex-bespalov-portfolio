[00:00] to get through. So, I'm going to let you
[00:02] guys read through this uh little less on
[00:05] the AI news and the Bitcoin side this
[00:08] week because we got a lot on PMIs to go.
[00:14] So, uh first of all, S&P new high stocks
[00:18] won't stop. Uh and this is pretty much a
[00:23] definition of a bull market. Uh it's not
[00:25] just breaking out. Uh everything's
[00:27] breaking out. So breath makes new highs
[00:29] for the S&P. The equal weight S&P
[00:32] finally gets back and gets to new highs.
[00:36] Uh the BKX I highlighted a couple weeks
[00:38] that I think the banks are critical in
[00:40] this thing. I still believe it in this
[00:42] environment where I believe that we are
[00:44] in a a reflationary
[00:46] situation uh with a transition that's
[00:49] about to occur towards more PMI related
[00:51] names, steeper yield curves. the bank
[00:54] should be doing well. Uh, also from the
[00:56] AI benefits from profit margins post the
[01:00] JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs reports
[01:02] where I went through it, BKX is about to
[01:04] make new highs. Global banks have
[01:06] already made new highs. So, this is a
[01:07] global thing, not just a US thing. Uh,
[01:10] and if you thought maybe this uh wasn't
[01:13] strong, profit margins so far on the
[01:15] earnings reports are good and they're
[01:17] hanging near the highs. We're not seeing
[01:20] any problems yet on margins. Uh and I
[01:23] want to remind everyone as we go through
[01:25] this, anyone who is still negative at
[01:27] this point, we had a 20 plus percent
[01:29] correction and that was the third one uh
[01:32] in the last 6 years. So we've had three
[01:34] corrections of at least 20% and we're
[01:37] back to highs. So it's sentiment remains
[01:40] uh kind of middle ground. Uh but you're
[01:42] starting to get this stuff again. Uh
[01:45] hard renews warnings on bubble risk for
[01:47] stocks. Ignore. Uh this is just angry
[01:52] old man sitting on a front yard. There's
[01:54] a lot of people out there that are still
[01:56] going against what is happening. Uh and
[01:59] as I go through this, I'm going to start
[02:01] talking about this as the main theme. So
[02:02] I wrote this this week, posted it in
[02:04] 22V, also on Substack uh about a rise
[02:09] and in there I highlighted if you
[02:10] haven't seen this uh as Mark Andre said
[02:12] in a recent A16Z podcast, the decline in
[02:15] manufacturing wasn't inevitable. It was
[02:17] policy choice. We are at the beginning
[02:19] of significant change in the United
[02:21] States of America and global uh around
[02:24] the world in terms of industrial
[02:26] industrialization and for the US it's a
[02:29] reindustrialization. Things need to be
[02:31] on shore. This has been a theme for some
[02:32] time but now it's getting bigger. This
[02:34] is where the podcast is if you want to
[02:36] go listen to it. It's it's phenomenal in
[02:39] terms of Mark going through the history
[02:40] of industrialization. He connects it
[02:42] back to what's happening today in the
[02:45] current cities, the problems in the
[02:47] cities, particularly things of what's
[02:49] driving people towards the election
[02:52] situation in New York. I think it's very
[02:54] important to uh start paying attention
[02:56] to this more because this is what Trump
[02:59] won the election on and too many people
[03:01] are focused on, as I've said repeatedly
[03:04] uh and continuously, something from the
[03:06] 1800s in terms of tariffs, which are now
[03:08] officially over. Uh, and as much as
[03:11] people want to wait for some boogeyman
[03:13] to show up, they're missing what is
[03:14] happening, which is a move to hardware
[03:18] from software. We we are finishing an
[03:20] 18-year period where everything was
[03:22] about software around the globe, and now
[03:23] it's going to be about hardware. Uh,
[03:25] Jensen Huang, I'd study physics, not
[03:28] software if I were 20 today. Said that
[03:31] on CNBC this week. Um, so here we are.
[03:35] This is the change that I expect to
[03:36] happen. And this is where I think alpha
[03:38] is going to be made over the course of
[03:39] the next not just year these these times
[03:43] where we got up here we haven't had a
[03:46] industrial cycle in the PMI in a long
[03:48] long time. Uh it would have been during
[03:50] the housing bubble in terms of when we
[03:52] had stuff going out because aside from
[03:54] that these were just bounces from weaker
[03:56] periods on the back of either QE
[03:58] something with borrowing you had
[04:00] commercial real estate whatever. This is
[04:02] a much bigger uh uh buildout and it's
[04:05] coming at a time where this red line you
[04:07] can see we haven't had a time where
[04:08] we've stayed below the 50 level for a
[04:12] long time and I think we're going higher
[04:13] and I think it's already starting. Uh
[04:16] and I think the catalyst again for
[04:19] people on the tariff side and just what
[04:21] has triggered I believe the tariffs have
[04:22] actually triggered the PMI rise. So most
[04:25] people are looking at it as some
[04:26] negative. I think now this is what
[04:29] effectively went on this plan of adding
[04:32] 145% tariffs in on April 10th. Then
[04:37] China restricts rare earth and then no
[04:41] no more than two weeks later best and
[04:43] expense tariff standoff with China to
[04:45] deescalate.
[04:47] That was basically the realization that
[04:48] we have to focus on oning because we are
[04:51] too dependent on China. And this week we
[04:54] get basically all the deals done. It
[04:56] doesn't really matter whether we we
[04:58] actually complete them. I don't even
[04:59] think the details matter that much with
[05:01] this. It's more just to get the
[05:03] uncertainty out of the equation, which
[05:04] has been one of the big negatives on the
[05:06] PMIs. So, what do we have going on? An
[05:09] important breakout above the 200E moving
[05:11] average. We have a trending situation
[05:12] going on in raw industrials uh markets.
[05:15] This has been going on now since the
[05:17] fourth quarter of last year. We are
[05:19] continuing higher and we are at the
[05:20] highest level since 2022. You can go
[05:23] back and see. I think we're entering a
[05:24] period like this. So, this is what I'm
[05:26] expecting is a move higher in commodity
[05:30] prices, a reflationary boom
[05:33] and it's on the back of this which I
[05:34] showed last week. This is the data
[05:36] center construction numbers. Okay, again
[05:38] started with Chat GPT but really started
[05:40] to go up and then have continued and
[05:43] this is before we get the buildout of
[05:44] what's going on. Trump's big beautiful
[05:46] bill sparks investment surge across
[05:48] American businesses. uh
[05:51] very few people are noticing what is
[05:53] actually happening with the capex side
[05:55] that would be related to AI and the
[05:58] impact that it is having but it's
[06:00] starting to show up. We got the capital
[06:01] goods numbers this week. Focus on orders
[06:05] non-defense x aircraft. Here's the white
[06:09] line. That's year-over-year. Highest
[06:11] level since 2022. Matches up exactly
[06:13] with the CRB raw industrials market.
[06:16] Here's the PMI. We were having the
[06:18] bounce that you would have expected in
[06:20] here and then we came down as the tariff
[06:24] uncertainty kit in. Remember, the PMI is
[06:26] a a sentiment-based soft data index
[06:29] that's based on a survey. And so, when
[06:32] you get a change, these are actual good
[06:34] orders that are coming through. The auto
[06:36] market, the housing market, commercial
[06:37] real estate still suck. And I don't see
[06:39] them changing until Trump finds some way
[06:41] to get them higher. We'll talk about
[06:42] that as time goes on. Uh rates need to
[06:45] come down for that. There's a whole
[06:46] bunch of things that are going, but he's
[06:48] going to be focused, especially on
[06:50] residential real estate and getting that
[06:51] to happen. Uh here is I mean it's plain
[06:56] as day. This has started and this is
[06:57] what was referred to in that Fox report.
[07:00] This is the um capital goods shipments.
[07:03] So here's the shipments that started
[07:06] again in the third quarter of 20 or
[07:08] fourth quarter uh of 24 and have
[07:11] continued to move higher. This is the
[07:14] PMI going sideways. So we went have had
[07:17] the PMI under 50 because this was moving
[07:20] sideways or actually down. That chart
[07:22] still looks similar for housing, for
[07:25] commercial real estate, for autos. Now
[07:27] you're going to start to see a change
[07:29] up. And this this is just starting in my
[07:31] opinion the benefits that are going to
[07:32] come from tariffs and all the deals that
[07:34] Trump has made. Here are the uh
[07:36] month-to-month price changes. You can
[07:38] see a change that's happened. PMIs
[07:40] during this period. This is uh the last
[07:42] this is December of 22. You can see now
[07:45] all of a sudden we're getting consistent
[07:47] increases
[07:49] in shipments. Uh US data momentum from
[07:52] Goldman Sachs. Uh we've got the hard
[07:54] data picking up. We've got the soft data
[07:56] picking up. We've got the labor data
[07:57] picking up.
[07:59] Hang, this gets important. Um
[08:03] you cannot ignore what's happening in
[08:04] China now. You could have doubted it. Um
[08:06] back in September of last year when we
[08:08] got this spike, they were doing
[08:10] stimulus. Everyone faded. It came back
[08:13] down. Now we're breaking out. PMIs
[08:15] overlaid with Hang Sen. You cannot
[08:17] ignore anymore what's happening in
[08:19] China. Uh and this week, China is moving
[08:22] something forward in terms of one of the
[08:24] biggest uh what will be one of the
[08:26] biggest world's dams. They're continuing
[08:29] to spend. And what happened? China Coke
[08:30] and coal prices hit daily limit. So this
[08:33] week was a huge week for cocal prices
[08:35] which have been in a bare market. Uh in
[08:38] fact uh we have data. This is the third
[08:40] contract. So this is not a front month
[08:42] situation. And this is the third
[08:44] contract out. Uh biggest week in the
[08:47] last decade.
[08:51] Here's the chart you've broken through.
[08:53] And again, I think the critical thing to
[08:54] look at is when the stimulus measures
[08:56] came out, we got a bounce in this and
[08:58] then a peak and then a much bigger
[09:01] bounce, much stronger. You're dealing
[09:03] with multiple limit up days. Uh steel
[09:05] prices even got a bounce out of this for
[09:07] the week, up 5%, one of the largest
[09:09] since 2022.
[09:11] uh around the same amount as uh as
[09:15] September and this started to have an
[09:17] impact even on US
[09:19] uh coal prices. So again, we saw this
[09:21] bounce in coal prices here again, China
[09:25] stimulus. Now we've got this is BTU,
[09:27] this is Peabody coal went back up to
[09:29] this line. I fully expect that this
[09:31] situation as people grasp that this is
[09:33] not uh something to fade and it's
[09:36] global. So you've got Germany now uh has
[09:39] already seen their data turn. They've
[09:40] seen their zoo expectations go higher.
[09:43] Uh they've got defense spending that's
[09:45] happening. Again, the tariff situation
[09:47] caused all of these things to kind of
[09:49] get people to do things on their own
[09:52] shore. Whether it's China, whether it's
[09:54] Germany, whether it's the US, it's all
[09:57] going on. And this is the thing I was
[09:59] mentioning. So, I think you need to take
[10:01] this into consideration as the US
[10:02] considering no tax on capital gains on
[10:04] home sales. Regardless of this, I've
[10:06] talked about Bill Py each week. I've
[10:09] talked about the need and the belief
[10:11] that they will do something to help
[10:13] people with housing affordability. This
[10:16] is one route to go. Uh on top of the
[10:19] fact that they're going to keep
[10:20] pressuring to get rates lower. Now, what
[10:22] does all this mean? I put this out this
[10:24] week. I'm going to spend a lot of time
[10:26] talking about I brought it up last week.
[10:28] At major macro regime shifts, if the PMI
[10:30] is coming out of a sub50 thing, you
[10:32] should expect for momentum to turn. We
[10:35] have a very large differential between
[10:38] uh commodity related uh stocks uh
[10:41] anything related to construction outside
[10:43] of a few industrials the industrials
[10:45] that have benefited so far from the data
[10:48] center buildout. But when PMIs go up by
[10:51] definition if the PMIs head up to 60
[10:53] think always think of it as a rising
[10:55] tide lifts all boats. Um we're going to
[10:57] start running into capacity issues. I'll
[10:59] start showing you that when you get that
[11:01] that's when the PMI starts to benefit.
[11:03] So momentum to me is turning down. I've
[11:06] talked about it. Um here is the
[11:07] technicals on it. We just got a MACD
[11:09] weekly sell signal on momentum. The last
[11:11] one we got was back in here, which is
[11:14] when momentum rolled over. I just wanted
[11:16] to show this multiple line divergence is
[11:19] very similar to the last major regime
[11:22] inflection point. This is what I'm
[11:24] comparing it to. I believe the AI spend
[11:27] on AI and the faster AI goes is
[11:29] disruptive to technology companies.
[11:31] Anything built on code, which is what
[11:33] dominates the winners of the last 17 18
[11:37] years, is at risk to code being
[11:40] ubiquitous and free. At the same time,
[11:42] to fuel that growth of where the tech
[11:44] sector is now 50 plus% of the S&P,
[11:48] you need power. Utilities plus energy,
[11:50] sub 7% of the S&P. It's out of whack and
[11:53] we need more and more power. We've got
[11:55] the triple divergence here on the MACD
[11:57] weeks. This would have been a sell
[11:59] signal to me except we got the tariffs.
[12:01] It got people focused on recession fears
[12:03] again and all kinds of fears and they
[12:05] bailed out. Well, now we're coming back
[12:07] up and you're starting to see the
[12:08] momentum shift happening and it's
[12:10] causing problems. So, you've got quant
[12:12] suffering their biggest draw down since
[12:14] 2023. Goldman trader raises spectre of
[12:16] August 2007 quantquake.
[12:20] This is what I just talked about in
[12:21] terms of what was happening back in '08.
[12:23] when you get a dramatic shift and that
[12:26] quant unwind was more about GARP but
[12:30] regardless this is a significant thing
[12:32] to monitor and see if it continues. Uh I
[12:36] think it would have been going on uh I
[12:38] found this person this week. I like I
[12:40] like the work that they do on X. I would
[12:42] start following uh four quadrants of
[12:46] hell in long short. Now again this is
[12:48] more on the quant side but you've got
[12:50] high short interest names which are
[12:51] ripping. You've got low quality
[12:54] outperforming high quality
[12:57] short losers.
[12:59] Negative revisions outperforming
[13:02] positive revisions. I agree this is a
[13:05] problem. Uh and it shows up in the
[13:07] Goldman Sachs long short uh monthly
[13:11] numbers. So so far in July, this was uh
[13:14] earlier in the week, but you can see
[13:15] that it started in June and it carried
[13:17] into July. So you've had backtoback 9%
[13:20] months through this week. So, it's a
[13:21] significant shift that's happening.
[13:24] Again, when you get to as you guys get
[13:26] to know me better, I look for ideas.
[13:28] I've been talking about the power
[13:29] situation in the US on the back of AI
[13:32] since September of last year. I always
[13:34] look for things that I think are going
[13:36] to catch people where there's been
[13:37] underinvestment and when it starts to
[13:40] show up and you get through the initial
[13:42] excess capacity, which is always there
[13:44] on these. It's an old old Elliot wave
[13:46] pattern uh mechanism that I use which is
[13:49] when you get a mega ma massive shift
[13:51] from a 17-year period. The first thing
[13:53] you have to do is go through the excess
[13:54] supply. No one believes it when it
[13:56] happens. The third wave is when it's
[13:58] powerful and that's when everyone jumps
[14:00] on board and that's what I think we're
[14:01] about to enter into now. So other places
[14:04] just to run through these quickly again
[14:06] Goldman Sachs highlighting all of these
[14:08] things about where the short interest
[14:09] pair had done violent move. This one
[14:12] here, very famous of the GameStop time.
[14:15] So, we've had a significant short
[14:17] covering situation that's gone on.
[14:20] Retail heavily involved and you've got
[14:22] retail traders net buyers cash equity
[14:24] for 19 straight days. Hedge fund people
[14:26] continue to fade and most people I
[14:28] talked to in the institutional side
[14:29] continue to think this is a a joke with
[14:32] retail. Not a joke. This has been going
[14:34] on for some time. Uh this is insanity.
[14:36] ret retail
[14:38] one day option trading is about to hit
[14:41] 2/3 of all daily options trading. The
[14:44] market is literally a casino now. Yep.
[14:46] Adapt or die. This is not going away. Uh
[14:49] the younger generation has a different
[14:51] mindset in terms of investing and it's
[14:53] against passive. And to be honest with
[14:54] you, uh, a trading environment right now
[14:57] in the world that I see when I'm writing
[14:59] pieces and talking about 2030s being a,
[15:02] uh, graveyard for Fortune 500 companies,
[15:05] there are no more moes. There are no
[15:07] more guarantees. And we're entering a
[15:09] period now where Peabody coal is a two
[15:11] billion dollar market cap. Think about
[15:14] how much Nvidia moves every single day
[15:16] in terms of a market cap change. The
[15:18] energy sector is less than $2 trillion
[15:20] in market cap. you just have a situation
[15:23] where single stocks are bigger than all
[15:25] of them. So if all of the other single
[15:27] names start moving, where the Russell
[15:29] 2000 is smaller than Nvidia, you're
[15:32] going to have a problem if all of a
[15:33] sudden commodities go higher because a
[15:35] lot of names in the Russell 2000 are
[15:36] commodity based names. They tend to do
[15:38] better on this stuff. So we'll just have
[15:40] to see. Goldman Sachs Prime Brokers is
[15:42] again going through it, but they go
[15:43] through a bunch of different uh
[15:45] arguments in here in the way that it's
[15:47] moved. What's happened? I think this is
[15:50] becoming something that unless it
[15:52] reverses very quickly as we get into
[15:54] September and I'll show some reasons why
[15:56] I think there's some catalyst coming up.
[15:57] I think the PMI is really the biggest
[15:59] catalyst for this. These are all PMI
[16:02] type situations. Uh this is the problem.
[16:05] So I highlighted the issue that's
[16:07] showing up. So the white line here right
[16:10] now is threemonth earnings per share
[16:12] revision. So this is happening where
[16:15] companies where revisions are headed
[16:17] down are outperforming rei companies
[16:20] where revisions are going higher.
[16:22] Revisions don't take into account
[16:24] multiples. So as long as it stays to
[16:26] where the companies that have bad
[16:28] revisions never really get any earnings
[16:30] traction, that's fine. If all of a
[16:32] sudden commodities start going higher,
[16:33] most of the companies and commodities
[16:35] just had their earnings revisions taken
[16:36] lower because commodity prices fell
[16:39] during the whole tariff and everyone got
[16:41] bearish on them. The orange line here is
[16:44] the meggaap tech names
[16:47] relative to the nonprofitable
[16:50] tech names that's been correlated to the
[16:53] earnings per share revision. Makes sense
[16:55] except for the fact that this is the
[16:57] hedge fund positioning. So as long as
[17:00] this goes on and we get a beta trade the
[17:02] other way, which again happens a lot
[17:04] when small cap outperforms large cap. It
[17:06] happens when uh PMIs go higher. there
[17:10] ends up being a trade where people are
[17:12] buying beta on the back of it. Quants
[17:13] are going to move into this. Quants are
[17:15] moving out of the position. When I
[17:16] showed you the down move of Quants,
[17:18] remember they were up about 15% for the
[17:20] year. They're giving back gains on this,
[17:22] but they're shifting. And regardless of
[17:24] the reasons why, a lot of the momentum
[17:27] based stuff is shifting. And I think
[17:28] that's related to the commodity side.
[17:30] Again, I've highlighted this before. I
[17:32] just wanted to show how important
[17:33] momentum shifts are from a macro basis.
[17:37] This is when the Fed pivoted. This is
[17:39] before COVID. Obviously, we got the
[17:41] continuation in COVID. This was when
[17:43] energy prices
[17:45] uh collapsed. And then this was uh
[17:48] during 200 uh great financial crisis
[17:51] obviously in terms of the the movement
[17:53] of momentum and how everyone got trapped
[17:55] in one particular plan. Uh if you didn't
[17:59] get all the details, uh this is 28page
[18:01] report. This goes through and is the
[18:03] playbook for the next four years. As far
[18:05] as I'm concerned, we've talked about AI
[18:07] on this. We've talked about Bitcoin, but
[18:08] in terms of the AI action plan and what
[18:10] it means, if you didn't listen to the
[18:12] speech, you should listen to the speech.
[18:14] Uh, but let's just go through the action
[18:17] plan ties technological supremacy to
[18:19] industrial rebirth.
[18:21] He talks specifically about AI has
[18:25] benefit tech companies have benefited
[18:26] dramatically. This was with Jensen Yuang
[18:28] in the audience. He spoke about him a
[18:30] bunch of times during this. He's saying
[18:32] there needs to be a transition to the
[18:34] industrial side and they are the ones
[18:36] that are going to take manufacturing
[18:38] revival. We need energy independence.
[18:41] The capital investment incentives. This
[18:43] is from the one big beautiful bill. He
[18:45] talks about it extensively. Both the
[18:47] benefits for the auto companies but
[18:49] especially for capex to continue. This
[18:51] is the structural reason why it'll go.
[18:53] And then for all of the PMI stuff, fast
[18:55] permitting and deregulation allowing
[18:57] things to happen because we have no
[18:59] choice. And that becomes the issue that
[19:01] is uh going to show up as I go through
[19:03] this. We're at that trigger point where
[19:05] it has to happen. Uh in terms of the
[19:07] re-industrialization, again, bringing
[19:09] out full capital expensing. If you guys
[19:11] didn't go through it, I'm not going to
[19:12] read all of these things, but he talks
[19:14] specifically about the auto industry,
[19:16] about the structures, factory equipment,
[19:18] factories, D center, power plants, the
[19:19] 92 billion already invested in uh from
[19:22] Pennsylvania.
[19:24] If you're not building fast enough, you
[19:26] might be the bottleneck, the permitting
[19:28] reform. He's trying to make sure that
[19:30] there is no slowdown in this. So if you
[19:32] remember what happened with the
[19:33] fasttracking of the vaccine, everyone
[19:36] who remained bearish during 2020 made a
[19:39] huge mistake. He fasttracked the ability
[19:41] of getting the vaccines out. That was
[19:43] the critical decision. This is the
[19:45] critical thing for this year. He is
[19:47] going to make sure that we are going to
[19:48] see the industrial side and we have
[19:50] midterm elections coming up. So
[19:52] everything is focused on getting this
[19:53] out. I'll go through the bottlenecks are
[19:55] actually going to be, but this is it.
[19:57] So, go read all this stuff on your own
[19:58] in terms of the the tax incentives from
[20:02] the one big uh from the one big
[20:04] beautiful bill. Just go through all of
[20:07] the things. But supporting small and
[20:09] midsize manufacturers, fueling tech and
[20:11] AI growth, lowering investment barriers,
[20:14] reshoring, everything needs to be built
[20:16] in the United States. This is a dramatic
[20:18] shift and this is a plan that he was
[20:20] elected on and he's going to do. Uh so
[20:23] again the action plan combined with the
[20:25] uh one bill big beautiful bill drives
[20:28] aggressive tax extend aimed at boosting
[20:30] US capital investment in AI related
[20:31] infrastructure from semiconductors to
[20:33] factories and data centers. These
[20:34] policies are crafted to accelerate
[20:36] industrial reindustrialization promote
[20:38] AI infrastructure sovereignty critical
[20:41] AI infrastructure sovereignty. We
[20:42] learned that with the rare earth
[20:44] minerals. We have to do all of that
[20:48] or we're in trouble. Morgan Stanley put
[20:51] out 70 billion boost for megaap cap. So
[20:53] you've got the bank saying, "Wow, this
[20:55] is a big boost in terms of the tax
[20:56] changes for the meggaap tech companies
[20:59] again for the infrastructure buildout."
[21:01] Uh I just don't hear enough people kind
[21:04] of going through it and realizing how
[21:06] important this is to the PMI. Uh that's
[21:08] really the big thing is you're trying to
[21:10] force different ways and he goes through
[21:12] and talks about how important this was
[21:14] and why it was included in there.
[21:16] Department of Defense directly invests
[21:17] in US based rare earth mining company
[21:20] $400 million. Apple also made an
[21:24] investment in it. Show the private
[21:25] sector involved. This was an MP
[21:28] materials basically the only rare earth
[21:30] material rare earth company here. Uh we
[21:33] have to build mining companies. We have
[21:34] to build mining out to be able to get
[21:37] the rare earth which is another
[21:38] component of the uh buildout that has to
[21:42] happen in industrialization. It is not
[21:44] just building our cars here. It is not
[21:46] just we have to mine for the stuff that
[21:49] we need. This podcast A16Z critical
[21:52] minerals mining for the industrial
[21:54] future. It's a different world. Go
[21:56] listen to the podcast. You'll get more
[21:58] details. But if you want to get at least
[21:59] the highlights here technologies like AI
[22:02] servers, battery satellites and jets
[22:03] rely on rare earth such as lithium. We
[22:06] have none of these. So this person who's
[22:08] doing this, who's starting this company,
[22:10] he was working uh on battery materials
[22:12] at Tesla. They go through why it's
[22:15] important, what's going to happen to the
[22:17] mining industry. Uh talks about the
[22:19] bottlenecks, regulatory challenges,
[22:21] everything that's going on. But US
[22:23] industrial strategy hinges on rebuilding
[22:25] mining infrastructure without
[22:26] competitive policies. Support mining
[22:28] capacity remains fragile. Uh again,
[22:30] we've had ESG, we've had uh all reasons
[22:33] that we have not invested in anything on
[22:36] the supply side in uh in the US for the
[22:40] last six years plus. We've seen these
[22:42] stocks dramatically underperform.
[22:45] They don't have the capacity to go out.
[22:47] So, they're going to have to build new
[22:48] things and they're going to have to get
[22:49] more US priorities recovery of critical
[22:51] minerals from mine waste. Again, now
[22:54] we're going through and these are just
[22:55] signals that we have to do this that
[22:57] we're going to go to all causes and it's
[22:59] a shortterm issue. Everything you're
[23:01] going to see as I get into the power two
[23:03] are indications of just not only
[23:06] desperation but shortterm
[23:09] uh problem solutions that they're trying
[23:11] to get. Uh there was a hearing this week
[23:15] on increased electricity demand. I'm
[23:17] sure many of you have seen your
[23:18] electricity bills go up sharply since
[23:20] June. Uh get used to it and remember
[23:23] this is going to be a big part of what's
[23:24] going on. gas prices at the pump uh will
[23:27] be the benefit that stay at lower levels
[23:29] uh because this is an electricity thing.
[23:31] It's gas, it's nuclear, it's other
[23:33] issues, but it is uh going to impact
[23:35] electricity prices. And so they met on
[23:37] this to talk about what has to happen to
[23:40] make sure they can still have the AI
[23:41] buildout and the electrification for the
[23:44] industries which again will need more
[23:46] and more electricity in the future
[23:47] because of humanoids, uh because of
[23:49] electric cars, everything along those
[23:51] lines. The major themes in the coverage
[23:53] permitting and grid expansion AI and
[23:55] data centers key drivers uh energy
[23:57] policy for everything ability and access
[24:01] urgency for policy reform the hearing
[24:02] spot uh spotlighted a rare bipartisan
[24:05] consensus bipartisan when you see
[24:07] bipartisan in the US it's something you
[24:08] should foc on from an investment
[24:10] standpoint need for streamlined
[24:11] regulation infrastructure investment
[24:17] I remind uh I showed this last week but
[24:20] Eric Eric Schmidt warns of AI super
[24:22] intelligence outpacing Earth's energy
[24:24] limits. Chips will outrun power needs.
[24:27] We are at that moment now in terms of
[24:30] where they're having to build faster
[24:32] because they can already see that ending
[24:34] unless they pick it up. The AI boom
[24:35] might collapse not from technical limits
[24:37] but from physical ones. Mors law meets
[24:40] physics. And this is the reason why um I
[24:43] showed this in May.
[24:46] uh Sundar Pachai released this and
[24:48] showed that it was a 50 times growth.
[24:50] Now I didn't put this in here but I did
[24:52] back then. You can go into chat GPT and
[24:55] see that tokens equate to electricity.
[24:58] Yes, there can be some efficiency gains
[24:59] over time but right now tokens are
[25:02] pretty much just a representation of
[25:03] electricity needs. So it was a 50 times
[25:07] move in a year and now we just did a
[25:10] doubling in two months.
[25:13] As we get into video, this will
[25:15] accelerate. It will just continue to go.
[25:17] Goldman Sachs put out something on
[25:19] powering the AI era. A lack of capital
[25:21] is not the most pressing bottleneck for
[25:22] AI progress. It's the power needed to
[25:24] fuel it.
[25:26] So, here we go. Biggest US grid sets
[25:28] capacity. So, this is the east coast
[25:31] north northeast coast PJM grid sets
[25:33] capacity price record
[25:36] 329.
[25:39] AI boom leads to record US grid costs
[25:41] call for new plants. The price increase
[25:43] prompted calls from utilities and energy
[25:45] groups to build more generation with
[25:47] Sean Kelly saying it literally tells you
[25:48] we are out of generation and that is not
[25:51] good for consumers. Again, I started
[25:53] talking about this in September. It has
[25:55] been ignored for the most part by
[25:57] investors. It will not be ignored
[25:59] anymore because we are now at the point
[26:01] where this is a problem. America has an
[26:04] electricity problem. So here's should
[26:06] have been a wearable but now we're
[26:08] reacelerating again. So we had this move
[26:10] higher. This was not related. This is
[26:13] coming out of 2020. Uh now we're into a
[26:16] different period. This acceleration here
[26:18] matches up with what I just showed from
[26:20] uh from Google. We have more electricity
[26:22] needs now because we're building out
[26:24] more data. As we build out more data
[26:26] centers, we need more of this. No spare
[26:28] capacity. Watchdog warns L. This is all
[26:30] this week. All zero hedge. Largest US
[26:33] grid is maxed out amid data center
[26:34] buildout. This is that same data center
[26:36] I mentioned on the east coast. Uh,
[26:38] largest US power grid issues maximum
[26:41] generation alert.
[26:45] DOE orders constellation to delay
[26:47] retiring to ease PJM emergency. There's
[26:50] all kinds of things going on where the
[26:52] government is getting involved to make
[26:53] sure because they're trying to help
[26:55] consumers and they're trying to help
[26:56] people keep be able to keep the air
[26:58] conditioning on this month. So, if
[26:59] you're wondering what's going on, AI is
[27:01] just gobbling everything up. data
[27:04] centers seek flexible power solutions
[27:05] for resilience, sustainability. They're
[27:08] trying everything right now. This is a
[27:09] race to try to figure out because we
[27:11] can't slow down. China's accelerating.
[27:13] China has more electricity. Trump gave
[27:15] in the speech that he was shocked that
[27:17] we need double the electricity needs
[27:19] than we have right now by 2030. This is
[27:22] where the issue comes in that needs to
[27:24] be there. So, you're starting to see
[27:25] stuff like this. I mentioned this. XAI
[27:28] just bought a power plant from overseas
[27:30] and are shipping it to the US because
[27:31] they couldn't get a new one built in
[27:32] time. They're doing all this crazy
[27:34] to get the compute. Mus responded to the
[27:37] post describing it as accurate. Again,
[27:39] when you start getting into these
[27:40] indications, it shows the desperate
[27:43] nature of it and how much they need. It
[27:45] is a race not only by the government to
[27:47] help out, but by these companies um
[27:51] and it's to supply one of its data
[27:53] centers. So again, when you get into
[27:55] these situations that all this stuff is
[27:57] happening,
[27:59] you get the next one too. He did this
[28:01] this week. Lon Moss AI company buys 114
[28:04] acre South uh power plant site. This is
[28:09] in Mississippi. It's a former power
[28:12] plant site. So
[28:14] whatever reason he's buying these,
[28:16] there's parts on it. There's the ability
[28:18] of doing it quicker. He's doing things
[28:20] to avoid the permitting anything he
[28:22] possibly can to speed because it is a
[28:23] race by them to get the power that's
[28:25] there. Open AAI signed something with
[28:27] Oracle this week. I just didn't have
[28:29] enough time to put all these slides in
[28:30] there, but you can go see that. And then
[28:32] Google um
[28:35] fusion energy inches closer to reality.
[28:37] Google is buying a boatload of fusion
[28:39] energy. The only problem is that its
[28:41] suppliers lack a power plant, has
[28:42] produced no energy to date, and may
[28:44] never do so on commercially viable
[28:45] terms. This these were all hammers,
[28:48] guys. So, when you saw the 3M island a
[28:50] few months ago, these are all hail Marys
[28:52] to try and get power uh from existing
[28:55] capacity. That's the critical thing that
[28:57] I want people to think about. We're
[28:59] going from a world of existing capacity
[29:01] that was out there. Now, we've got to
[29:04] get new capacity. That's where the PMI
[29:06] comes in. That's why this is just now.
[29:08] All we've been doing so far is preparing
[29:10] for this with the data centers. Now,
[29:11] you've got the government behind you.
[29:13] when you saw those capital goods numbers
[29:15] going higher and you saw the data consu
[29:17] uh data center construction that was
[29:19] without government support
[29:22] uh we're going to run in this just
[29:24] highlights how unprepared we are from uh
[29:26] Cruso orders 19 natural gas turbines
[29:28] from GE uh Vernova the announced order
[29:32] of 19 units booked in 2025 builds on the
[29:34] first series of 10 and combined is
[29:38] expected to provide nearly 1 gawatt of
[29:40] electricity one gawatt we're trying to
[29:42] build out we need 90 more at a minimum
[29:45] by 2030. So timelines for delivery
[29:48] weren't shared. The reason they weren't
[29:49] shared is gas turbines were dead in
[29:51] 2022, 2023. I heard customers say we'll
[29:54] never be able to get a regulator to
[29:56] approve gas turbines ever. So look what
[29:58] that phrase is. They were dead. They
[30:00] were dead because no fossil fuels were
[30:02] allowed. We weren't allowed to build
[30:03] them. This is the ESG side. We're
[30:06] ramping up our capacity. We're trying to
[30:07] produce more and more gas turbines. And
[30:09] frankly, we can't make enough gas
[30:11] turbines to support the market. Supply
[30:13] and demand, PMIs.
[30:17] Reports suggest natural gas turbine
[30:18] makers are struggling to meet a surge in
[30:20] demand from data centers with backlogs
[30:22] for orders reaching beyond 2029. The
[30:25] desire for natural gas by the data
[30:27] center industry is itself a byproduct of
[30:29] demand for the immediate capacity and
[30:30] grid constraints. So again, this is all
[30:33] happening now. Most of the stuff as
[30:36] we're going through is now. The other
[30:37] bottleneck that's going to happen and
[30:39] the reason I'm bringing these up, the
[30:40] bottlenecks are going to happen are not
[30:41] from capital. They are, as Goldman had
[30:43] put, this is from people. So, we don't
[30:47] have enough laborers to do the work for
[30:48] the grid buildout. This is a classic
[30:51] situation that the government is going
[30:52] to have to do whatever they can to make
[30:54] this happen. And it is similar to me as
[30:57] to what we had to do with the vaccine.
[30:58] So, I would not fade the fact that the
[31:00] PMI is going to go higher. And I would
[31:01] think about again your underestimation
[31:03] in 2020 of the ability for the economy
[31:05] to pick up on the back of the fact that
[31:07] we had this. We need power right now.
[31:09] They're going to find some way to get it
[31:11] because they're in a race against China
[31:12] for military supremacy and the
[31:14] hyperscalers are in a race for each
[31:15] other. Um this was some uh someone
[31:18] showed me uh this uh on uh X this week.
[31:22] Uh it said this person had good calls uh
[31:24] over the years. I went through it. It's
[31:26] a former drill captain and
[31:30] not that anyone cares, but I'm a
[31:31] full-blown energy bull again. Feels good
[31:33] to be back with the bulls. So, this is
[31:35] an energy person. Five reasons. Yep, I
[31:38] like this one. Everyone hates it.
[31:39] Correlation between gold and oil. Yep,
[31:41] this fits in with the CRB raw
[31:42] industrials market. Gold was leading.
[31:44] Gold typically does. RID count dropping
[31:46] in the permium. Yep, we've seen rig
[31:47] count going down. AI revolution is
[31:49] totally available. Power needed for
[31:51] these data centers. You can't build
[31:52] nuclear power plants overnight. I talked
[31:55] about this last week. Eric Schmidt
[31:56] talked about it on the video. And of
[31:58] course, last but not least, Kramer says
[32:00] to sell sell energy. So, I'll go with
[32:02] that. If you're looking for the person
[32:04] to listen to, uh, I joined 22V to do
[32:08] what I was doing on AI. I met a person I
[32:11] hadn't seen in the industry a long time,
[32:12] Colin Fenton, who does the commodities
[32:15] uh, work there. He has been all over
[32:18] this concept of abandoned alpha. It's a
[32:21] great name for it. It's exactly what it
[32:23] is. Colin and I both worked on the buy
[32:25] side a long time. We think in terms of
[32:27] what is the opportunity now. The key
[32:30] thing is energy is the top sector year
[32:31] to date at 8.2%. This was back before
[32:34] the tariffs. This was already working.
[32:36] That's the thing that I think people are
[32:38] missing is that energy over the mag 7
[32:41] was up 30% in the first quarter of this
[32:43] year. This is the trade that people
[32:45] should be focused on. Abandon alpha it.
[32:48] Colin and I are going to start doing a
[32:49] webinar for those institutional people
[32:51] out there. I highly recommend listening
[32:53] to it. We're going to do one together.
[32:54] It's going to be basically a podcast. Uh
[32:57] we've talked about this. We've known
[32:58] each other for 20 years. This is the
[33:00] most excited we've been about the
[33:01] commodity side in a long time. And it's
[33:03] because of all the dynamics that I've
[33:05] talked about
[33:08] as the PMIs are going higher. The other
[33:11] major story which has to be factored in
[33:13] again for pure momentum as a structural
[33:16] change. Back in 2008 when we had the
[33:20] tech sector take over, we had austerity
[33:22] going through. We had the Obama
[33:24] administration focused because the
[33:26] problem that put us into the issue was
[33:28] debt. Every single place around the
[33:30] world, Europe, the U was focused on
[33:33] austerity measures. With the austerity
[33:35] measures from the fiscal side, we did QE
[33:38] to move rates down to zero. So at a time
[33:42] when we didn't have anything growing in
[33:44] terms of the economy and we were doing
[33:46] austerity and we were coming out of an
[33:48] overbuild situation
[33:50] overinvestment in commodities we were
[33:52] doing QE to keep everything alive now
[33:54] what we have is we have higher rates we
[33:56] have PMIs that have been pinned at lower
[33:59] levels with no overbuild we've been
[34:01] under capa seen under capacity and
[34:03] everything related to commodities as I
[34:05] showed with both laborers and uh with
[34:08] gas turbines uh there's transformers
[34:11] that there shortages. Everything on that
[34:12] side we've underinvested to and we're
[34:15] pressuring the Fed to lower rates into a
[34:17] time where growth where nominal GDP is
[34:19] 5% and where the PMIs I believe are
[34:21] going to go higher. It continued again
[34:23] this week. Scott Besson on the Fed. I'm
[34:25] not going to go read all of these uh
[34:27] points for you guys. You've seen them
[34:29] all. No reason for Fed Jer to step down.
[34:30] They keep going back between this
[34:32] because they realize firing him would be
[34:34] bad, but they do want to see him resign.
[34:36] if he wants to leave early, he should.
[34:40] There's a lawsuit going on and uh
[34:42] there's a hearing that was agreed to
[34:44] happen on Monday at 2 PM
[34:48] this didn't get a lot of press. It's
[34:50] very important if for any reason um
[34:52] they're able to get this done. Meaning
[34:55] for uh this is arguing that the Fed
[34:58] should be transparent in their minutes,
[35:01] meaning in the meetings and you should
[35:02] be able to see and hear what's going on.
[35:05] This is a, you know, to me an important
[35:08] thing as to where we are in the Fed and
[35:10] the reason is they want to see if
[35:11] they've been politically influenced.
[35:13] They want to get through the argument
[35:14] and right now we've got an attack on not
[35:18] just Powell but on the institution of
[35:20] the Fed. So Mike Johnson
[35:24] spoke out against
[35:26] Goldman is and and a lot of market
[35:29] participants are talking that they're
[35:31] market participants are building in the
[35:33] likelihood
[35:35] uh that something changes with the Fed.
[35:38] Uh bond traders step up 2026 Fed cut
[35:41] bets after Trump bashes PAL. You're
[35:43] getting more and more of this focus and
[35:45] again despite the fact that I think the
[35:47] PMIs are going to go higher. The shadow
[35:49] fed is designed to make pal a lame duck
[35:50] and irrelevant. So pay attention to
[35:52] persistence. They matter more. Uh again,
[35:56] everyone's talking about it. Mhm.
[35:58] Alerian actually came out and said um
[36:02] he should resign to safeguard the Fed's
[36:05] operational autonomy, which I deem
[36:06] vital. Um,
[36:09] at this point it's become obvious that
[36:13] there's a flooding, as Bloomberg put, to
[36:16] pressure the Fed to get to move the Fed.
[36:19] And as Darius Dale, who I've mentioned
[36:21] on this a few times over the over the
[36:23] year, uh, he put this thread out, this
[36:26] will likely be the most important thread
[36:27] regarding the Federal Reserve you've
[36:30] reviewed in a long time. I'm just going
[36:32] to go through these four things. you can
[36:34] go look at it yourself, but he's
[36:35] highlighting that we're getting a shift
[36:39] in the Fed in the way the government at
[36:43] this point, which I'll get into after I
[36:45] go through these. This is Kevin Warser.
[36:47] If I were to step back for a minute, if
[36:48] I were the Fed president, what I'd be
[36:50] worried about is a central bank that
[36:51] doesn't see any of this. Central bank
[36:53] stuck with models from the 1978 with
[36:55] governments from a prior period and one
[36:57] that doesn't recognize we could be at
[36:58] the front of a productivity boom. So,
[37:01] they're starting to get ahead. and again
[37:05] could advance this economy. What we call
[37:07] AI. This is something I do believe in as
[37:10] well. Uh this is the theme that people
[37:12] are starting to jump on in the White
[37:14] House. There's actually some
[37:15] intelligence to it. We're headed to a
[37:18] point of humanoids in 5 years. We're
[37:20] headed to a point of AGI. We are in a
[37:22] race against China for this. If we lose
[37:24] it, we lose the military supremacy is
[37:26] the viewpoint. If we keep rates at
[37:28] higher levels, we're hurting the economy
[37:31] at a time when we expect deflationary
[37:34] pressures to extend in the in in the not
[37:38] too distant future. So they are
[37:40] basically saying we can handle inflation
[37:42] at a higher level. But the other reason
[37:44] for that,
[37:47] again, I'm just going through all of the
[37:48] things that he put in there in terms of
[37:50] the shift is because of this
[37:54] fiscal dominance. We have a debt to GDP
[37:58] sitting at over 120%. We have a fiscal
[38:02] deficit of 6 to 7%. What the government
[38:04] needs to do to reduce the pressure is
[38:07] they can't have the debt go up. They
[38:08] need interest rates to be low and they
[38:10] need inflation to be higher to do to
[38:12] debase the debt. So if we have nominal
[38:14] GDP growing at 5% and we have interest
[38:17] rates at 2%.
[38:19] That's what helps the situation. So they
[38:21] don't care about the inflationary
[38:22] pressures at this point as long as they
[38:24] stay somewhat in check, meaning they can
[38:26] handle 4%. So the administration is
[38:29] basically, in my opinion, raising the
[38:32] inflation component of this. Now, it
[38:34] comes at a time when the labor market is
[38:36] also on the weaker side where we're
[38:38] headed to creating less than 100,000
[38:40] jobs a month. That's where most of the
[38:42] forecasts are. Whether we get there or
[38:43] not is a different story. But you have
[38:45] to understand that this all fits in with
[38:48] the debasing needs because of the
[38:50] situation and AI sitting up there. So
[38:52] that's what leads us to this. President
[38:54] of the United States just posted a
[38:56] threeminute explanation of Bitcoin on
[38:57] social media. Absolutely epic. So again
[39:00] for all of you who continue to fade
[39:01] Bitcoin. It fits in the puzzle. And most
[39:04] importantly as we go through this, this
[39:07] white line here is gold year to date up
[39:10] 27%. Here's Bitcoin year to date. It's
[39:12] caught up. So, remember when we heard
[39:14] all of these things about how gold was
[39:16] going higher? Now, again, Bitcoin
[39:18] outperformed by 100 plus% two years ago,
[39:21] by 70 plus% last year, and now it's
[39:23] worked all the way back up. It will
[39:25] eventually just move higher from here uh
[39:28] dramatically. Here's the mag 7. It's
[39:30] outperforming that. So,
[39:34] that's where we are. If you want to go
[39:36] read the latest from Lyn Alden, I would
[39:37] go read this as well. The rise of
[39:39] Bitcoin stocks and bonds. Uh that's it
[39:41] for this week. Uh again, very focused on
[39:44] PMIs only because of the importance. For
[39:46] the institutional people out there who
[39:48] want to have a meeting with me to go
[39:50] through this, to talk about it more or
[39:52] to get Colin and I on the phone, don't
[39:54] hesitate to reach out to 22V. I'm going
[39:56] to be spending a lot of time on this. I
[39:58] think this is a very, very important
[40:00] point for people in your portfolios. Be
[40:02] very wary of the short side as we get
[40:05] PMIs moving higher. I expect a lot of
[40:06] the names that have been going higher to
[40:08] continue. That's it.
