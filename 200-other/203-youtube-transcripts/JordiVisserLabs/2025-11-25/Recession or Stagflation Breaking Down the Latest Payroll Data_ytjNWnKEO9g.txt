--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] over uh payrolls, stagflation,
[00:06] uh we didn't see long-term yields go up,
[00:08] stocks keep going. I'm going to keep
[00:09] harping on the size factor because the
[00:12] only things I get from people are
[00:15] refusals to accept Tesla and refusals to
[00:17] accept small cap. So, we're just going
[00:19] to keep going with it until the
[00:21] sentiment starts to shift uh and the
[00:23] data keeps supporting it. Uh macro
[00:27] players still having trouble adapt not
[00:29] focusing on AI. Uh time to focus on
[00:32] national housing emergency. If you only
[00:35] watch one thing today, spend it on
[00:36] national housing emergency. Uh regime
[00:39] shift signs are intensifying. AI is
[00:43] cannibalizing itself. It's power time
[00:46] and Tesla's $1 trillion man. All right.
[00:48] Payrolls. Um 80 economists.
[00:52] Uh only one uh
[00:57] did it surprise on the upside too.
[01:00] Payrolls were bad. Um the diffusion
[01:03] six-month diffusion has gone down to 48.
[01:06] Uh for all the data on this never not
[01:08] been in a recession. So again people
[01:12] getting hired jobs not the same as uh
[01:16] total income but jobs not good. Uh when
[01:19] you go through the categories again here
[01:21] you look at the last four months
[01:22] basically no jobs except for health
[01:26] care. So X healthcare and even though
[01:28] this is healthcare and education these
[01:30] are all healthcare jobs. Uh you're
[01:32] negative. So I will highlight down here
[01:35] government negative. Um I want to expand
[01:39] upon that because it's not a bad thing
[01:41] that we're getting rid of government
[01:43] jobs. Um, everyone believes the
[01:45] government is inefficient uh and doesn't
[01:47] need as many people as working it and
[01:49] making government smaller. That was part
[01:50] of Trump's goal. So, I just wanted to
[01:53] show you this is what's happened so far
[01:54] the year on the government. Obviously,
[01:56] the federal ones are dominating, but you
[01:58] can see negative. And then you can go
[02:00] back and look at the months before and
[02:02] then you can go back and look at the
[02:04] year and a half before just massive
[02:07] government jobs. This is not a bad
[02:08] thing. These are inefficient things
[02:10] moving back into the private sector.
[02:12] This is how big the numbers are. So when
[02:13] you're looking at jobs, I bring this up
[02:15] because the amount of jobs that's being
[02:18] hired, whether it's the immigration,
[02:20] whether it's the fact that there's
[02:21] approximately 300 people, 300,000 people
[02:24] in terms of the demographic shift. So we
[02:26] have labor losses that are happening
[02:27] every year regardless. We now have no
[02:30] immigration, which means that's more
[02:32] labor losses. Uh so when you go through
[02:35] it, look at aggregate weekly payrolls.
[02:37] Um, you know, they're back in here in
[02:40] the levels that they were before,
[02:42] bouncing around. Um, the threemonth
[02:45] change,
[02:47] sorry, this is a six-month change, is
[02:49] still right in here at this point. The
[02:51] 3-month is weaker, but overall, uh, the
[02:54] aggregate payrolls are fine. Now, uh,
[02:56] Waller had done an interview on CNBC. He
[02:59] again emphasized that labor is the focus
[03:03] uh, for him. And obviously after the
[03:06] Jackson Hole speech, we got Powell
[03:09] moving that way. And now with this
[03:11] payroll number, we're over 100% of a cut
[03:14] in September. Uh getting to, you know,
[03:20] about three cuts by the end of the year
[03:22] being built in now. And rates, two-year
[03:25] rates went down, not surprisingly.
[03:28] Surprisingly to everyone who's been
[03:29] trying to short bonds though, 10ear
[03:31] rates went down. So that whole argument
[03:33] last year that when the Fed cut here,
[03:38] it led to this big rate. Well, if that's
[03:40] the case here, we've now had three sharp
[03:43] moves lower since PAL. We're now almost
[03:45] 30 basis points lower. So for everyone
[03:48] that thought again that that was the
[03:49] best trade, follow the jobs. And here is
[03:53] something Dennis Busher put out this
[03:54] week with his team uh on just what's
[03:57] been driving tenure rates and just
[03:59] showing that it is the Bloomberg US
[04:02] labor surprise index should not be a
[04:04] surprise to people but it was so of
[04:06] course we've had fears over tariffs
[04:09] we've had fears over recession we've had
[04:12] fears over inflation and now we're going
[04:14] to go into stagflation. Uh so the
[04:16] commentary of course uh maybe someone
[04:18] should tell the stock market like the
[04:21] stock market should trade off your
[04:22] views. Stagflation has officially
[04:24] arrived. Doesn't even mean anything
[04:26] guys. It means nothing. Uh this the
[04:28] definition for stagflation is not uh 3%
[04:32] core inflation, 2.7% headline inflation
[04:36] and 5% nominal GDP. So go do some work.
[04:40] Stock should really be in the red. Oh,
[04:41] this is Marco. I don't need to show it.
[04:43] The the reason I want to show it is he
[04:44] even reposted his posting
[04:47] to prove that he was right. Stocks
[04:49] finished down on the day. Uh UBS gives
[04:51] America. Oh, now we're going to go into
[04:53] recession. So once you leave
[04:54] stagflation, the next fear for you guys
[04:56] to focus on uh is recession. So stupid.
[05:01] Um all right. And here's long-term
[05:03] yield. So you got to worry about these
[05:05] because again there's a big deficit,
[05:06] there's a lot of debt, bonds are
[05:08] collapsing, blah blah blah. It's
[05:10] actually fairly boring. But if you guys
[05:12] want to keep doing that, go ahead. What
[05:14] you should be doing instead of
[05:15] stagflation is reading about
[05:18] solo paradox.
[05:20] That's what I wrote. It's a solo
[05:22] paradox. Um, you can see the computer
[05:24] age everywhere, but in the productivity
[05:26] statistics. So this is in 1987 and this
[05:28] was really the beginning of a paradox as
[05:31] to why wasn't the digital revolution
[05:34] showing up in the numbers. Not just
[05:36] again productivity gains. traditional
[05:39] GDP and productivity metrics miss
[05:41] quality improvements in tangibles.
[05:43] You're you're following when you say
[05:44] stagflation you are basically saying
[05:47] number one I believe the CPI numbers
[05:49] which no one believes them unless they
[05:51] fit their narrative and number two I
[05:52] believe the GDP numbers which cannot
[05:55] possibly deal with artificial
[05:56] intelligence. So you look to profit
[05:58] margins and corporate profits which no
[06:00] we shouldn't talk about those because in
[06:02] stagflation corporations do phenomenally
[06:04] well like they're doing right now. uh
[06:07] early adoption of computers often slowed
[06:08] workers down while companies learned how
[06:10] to in this is one of the big things the
[06:12] early adoption so we started to see
[06:14] numbers be moved up in the 1990s once
[06:17] businesses adapted this is what's coming
[06:20] in front of you the adoption phase for
[06:22] AI is next year every time a macro
[06:24] person speaks and doesn't mention AI
[06:26] turn it off every single time can't
[06:30] emphasize it enough remember this was a
[06:32] report last week from Eric Brin Jolson
[06:35] who's an economist
[06:36] who is out at Stanford and they put this
[06:39] piece out on the effects that are having
[06:41] on the labor market from artificial
[06:43] intelligence. This is going to be a
[06:45] theme. I've talked about it for over a
[06:47] year now that we would reach a point
[06:49] that the Fed would be in trouble. That
[06:51] growth would still be okay. You'd have
[06:53] inflation going higher. I thought it
[06:55] would be coming from the power needs,
[06:56] which I still think are going to be
[06:57] there. The buildout for AI.
[07:00] Instead, it's coming a little bit from
[07:02] the tariffs right now. But I don't think
[07:03] inflation is coming down. I think they
[07:06] need inflation to be on the higher side,
[07:08] as they've said, to try and grow their
[07:10] way out.
[07:11] So, the S&P with all of the shenanigans
[07:14] was basically unchanged for the week.
[07:16] The NDX is up. Um, Russell's up for the
[07:19] fifth week in a row. And see this here,
[07:23] 18 of the last 22 weeks, it's been
[07:26] higher. Small caps are alive and well.
[07:28] And as I go through this, be wary of the
[07:31] small caps. Gold finally broke out of
[07:34] this beautiful channel going higher.
[07:36] Some of the comments people have said,
[07:37] "Why don't I talk about gold more?" I
[07:39] love gold. I own gold some. Nowhere near
[07:41] as much Bitcoin. Uh but again, it's a
[07:44] narrative that works in the debasing
[07:46] theme. So, anyone that owns gold should
[07:48] own Bitcoin. Anyone who owns Bitcoin
[07:49] should own gold. Um revisions. Again,
[07:52] I'm talking about earnings in companies.
[07:55] Another massive week for revisions.
[07:57] Here's the latest weekly revisions. This
[07:59] is from the the city group for the US
[08:02] came in up here. This is the now the
[08:05] 10-week average. So we continue to move
[08:07] higher. This is overlaid with a PMI.
[08:09] When you see these kinds of numbers, as
[08:11] I've talked about in the last few weeks,
[08:13] it's a tide that lifts all boats. PMIs
[08:16] go higher. Here are the earning
[08:19] surprises. Again, if we're in
[08:20] stagflation, why are companies
[08:23] surprising? Why are they making so much
[08:26] money? In this case, Q3 bottoms up
[08:29] estimate. I just want you to read this
[08:31] increase. So the estimates, the bottom
[08:32] up increased by point4%. Doesn't sound
[08:34] like a big deal. That's since June 30th.
[08:37] So this is for Q3. This is not the
[08:38] quarter we just came out of. This is
[08:39] going forward. Analysts usually reduce
[08:42] earnings estimates. Over the past 5
[08:43] years, 20 quarters, earnings
[08:44] expectations have fallen by 1.4 on
[08:47] average. So we're up4 normally down 1.4.
[08:50] Over the past 10 years, they fall by
[08:52] 3.2. I can go on and on in this. These
[08:56] are facts. Stagflation is crap. It's a
[08:59] word. It means nothing. Every time
[09:01] someone uses it, ask them, "How are you
[09:04] incorporating artificial intelligence
[09:05] and earnings into your thought process
[09:06] of stagflation? Where is this coming
[09:08] from? Some historical thing that doesn't
[09:11] mean anything at a world where we're
[09:12] staring with humanoids coming at us.
[09:14] Please do the homework. Semiconductors,
[09:16] largest contributor year-over-year
[09:18] growth. Semiconductor industry large 43%
[09:22] year-over-year growth. Energy power.
[09:25] This is data centers. This is data
[09:27] centers.
[09:29] Make money going with where the big
[09:31] dollars are being put to work. Earnings
[09:33] call citing AI. Thing I want you to
[09:35] focus on here. The jump that we're
[09:38] seeing in financials. I've talked about
[09:39] this. They're breaking out. They have a
[09:42] huge tech budget. You are going to see
[09:44] profit margins in here. You're going to
[09:45] see it across sectors. Only one that
[09:48] cited it a little less was the tech side
[09:51] uh interestingly uh enough. Uh, and I'll
[09:54] get into more of that later. I'm going
[09:56] to keep emphasizing the point. I I'll
[09:57] get into robo taxis again later, but
[10:00] regime shift. This is something I went
[10:02] through. If you didn't watch the video
[10:03] two weeks ago, I highly recommend
[10:05] watching it because it's still going to
[10:06] be the same story going forward. Size,
[10:08] the size factor, sharp ratio 2.7. It's
[10:11] working its way lower. It's been the
[10:13] best factor. It's the one you want to
[10:14] watch. Size has worked in an market.
[10:17] You've had large caps outperforming
[10:19] small caps. That is not normal. Here's
[10:20] what the size chart looks like. And
[10:22] again, every week I get push back on
[10:24] certain themes and I love to get push
[10:26] back because that gives me a sentiment
[10:28] gauge. I am it is whatever number to
[10:32] zero. No one wants to embrace small
[10:34] caps. Everyone wants to fade small caps.
[10:37] So if you want to find something that
[10:39] even from a contrarian basis, forget
[10:41] that I'm going to show you why it should
[10:42] work. even if you just want to do it
[10:44] purely from a positioning basis. I
[10:46] showed you last week that CTA futures
[10:48] positioning massively short uh Russell
[10:51] and long NASDAQ. So take your pick in
[10:53] terms of where you want to go. You want
[10:55] to be long S&P, you want to be long
[10:56] NASDAQ, you want to be short Russell.
[10:58] Here's what the size factor is doing.
[10:59] Beautiful chart on this. John Rog I've
[11:01] highlighted loves the chart of IWM of
[11:04] Russell. I'll highlight that there. But
[11:06] this is the pure size factor which has a
[11:09] nice kind of rolling time. Now we've had
[11:11] other topping formations back in here.
[11:12] This was uh uh during the tariff
[11:15] situation, but this was really during
[11:17] the tech side of of the mag 7 going.
[11:19] This is happening in a different
[11:21] situation. This is while the market's
[11:22] going higher. So, I just watch the size
[11:24] factor in terms of the Morgan Stanley
[11:26] size factor, which doesn't make it pure.
[11:29] It doesn't neutralize it. The thing I
[11:30] want to show here is it's now hit
[11:33] higher. And again, there's a cyclical
[11:34] component to this. The Fed is about to
[11:37] cut rates. I'm saying PMIs are going
[11:39] higher. We've already seen that with the
[11:40] S&P. I'll get into the difference
[11:42] between the two of them. Um, but right
[11:44] now you've got the S&P
[11:47] PMI moving higher and you have the
[11:49] national ISM PMI not, but you have the
[11:52] size factor going up. If you have rates
[11:54] being cut, which helps size, and you
[11:56] have that, it's just another reason. Uh,
[11:58] Neil Sethy put this out from Bespoke.
[12:02] Uh, again, these worked really well in
[12:04] terms of these breath signals. If you go
[12:06] back to the ones I did back in April and
[12:08] and May coming out of the bottom from uh
[12:11] uh from liberation day when I wrote the
[12:14] paper uh back on April 10th about
[12:17] turbulence and the fact that you have to
[12:18] go in because the government is going to
[12:20] support the market. This is a breath
[12:23] signal on the Russell. And the
[12:25] interesting thing based on uh a breath
[12:27] being in the 99th percentile bespoke
[12:29] went through 6 months out up every
[12:31] single time and this is over the you
[12:33] know there's 15 of these signals back to
[12:35] 2010. The numbers are very high over one
[12:38] year. Uh I would be very wary of being
[12:40] short the Russell. And then you have
[12:42] this one and again this is from
[12:43] September of last year. But it is
[12:46] important to pay attention again since
[12:47] 1980. Five of the 10 best years for the
[12:50] S&P 500 happened when the Fed was
[12:52] cutting rates without a recession.
[12:53] That's where we are right now. So if you
[12:55] are being bearish at this point when the
[12:57] Fed cuts rates into this where I believe
[12:59] the PMI is going higher. The Fed has cut
[13:02] rates 12 times when the S&P was within
[13:04] 1%. Again, here we are. The market was
[13:06] higher one year later all 12 times.
[13:08] You're playing against history. You're
[13:10] playing against the numbers. You're also
[13:11] playing against leading indicators. So
[13:14] Russell over the S&P, the orange line
[13:16] barely moved higher. Again, no one
[13:18] supports this. Well, this is micro cap
[13:21] over the RTY. So what hasn't happened
[13:25] yet is the Russell hasn't gone higher
[13:27] and I believe that is because there are
[13:29] futures on it. There just hasn't been
[13:30] the covering. But regardless of it, it's
[13:32] been there. There's a cyclical nature of
[13:34] this with the dollar. The dollar has
[13:36] moved down historically. That has meant
[13:38] that the size factor which in this case
[13:41] obviously is uh is moving down. You've
[13:44] just started the dollar weakness
[13:47] historically has a component which is
[13:50] good for both commodities and good for
[13:51] beta. Well, in this case small caps have
[13:53] not large outperform and what benefited
[13:56] again was the mag 7. I'm going to go
[13:59] through a couple of macro and these are
[14:00] macro podcasts. Two of the the few that
[14:03] I I listen to I would say at least
[14:05] monthly. I like these guys a lot. Uh
[14:08] probably because um I really don't care
[14:10] that much about the Fed, but I think
[14:11] they're very good at at getting in front
[14:13] of things. Uh they do a roundup every
[14:16] week. I highly recommend it. They're
[14:18] also
[14:19] good Bitcoin people, so they do a good
[14:21] job of connecting back the Fed's uh
[14:23] decisionmaking uh back to crypto. But in
[14:27] this case, every single thing in there I
[14:30] could care less about. Um again, gold
[14:32] thesis, not a surprise. Stagflation
[14:34] light. Uh, I think these guys are more
[14:36] realistic. I think they don't get over
[14:38] their skis. I think they do both sides
[14:40] real well. Do they mention AI? They say
[14:43] AI is taking jobs. Again, no offense to
[14:46] people, but don't understand AI. But I
[14:49] think at some point you have to admit
[14:50] that you don't understand the
[14:52] environment we're in. I had to do that
[14:53] in 2013 when I didn't understand how
[14:56] Amazon could finish at could trade at
[14:58] infinity forever. Uh, and I wanted to
[15:00] learn why it was happening and why it
[15:02] was justified. I went out Silicon
[15:03] Valley, spent a bunch of time at S
[15:05] Singularity University. It led to me
[15:07] doing these things and being very
[15:08] focused on AI. I highly recommend you do
[15:10] the same thing and open your uh your
[15:12] brain to possibilities that the reason
[15:14] you're wrong is not just timing. Uh it
[15:17] could be that you're not paying
[15:18] attention to signals that matter the
[15:20] most. Um Jim Biano, who I like again, he
[15:24] was on Macro Voices, one that I like.
[15:26] I'm not going to read through all this.
[15:27] I got bored within 2 minutes of this. I
[15:30] actually listened to it solely for you
[15:32] guys just to show that nothing in here
[15:35] in my opinion matters. He's been saying
[15:37] the same story for a while. I like Jim
[15:40] Biano. Nothing in here I found to be
[15:43] worth anything.
[15:45] Did he mention AI? No. AI isn't
[15:47] mentioned in this episode. Discussion
[15:49] centers. I just don't care. If you can't
[15:51] even mention it, it's not there. Now,
[15:53] let's go to my boy Pump. We not only do
[15:56] a weekly thing together. The guy hustles
[15:58] and interviews a bunch of people and he
[16:00] asks good questions and more importantly
[16:02] pays attention to what's happening in
[16:03] the news as opposed to what happened in
[16:06] history. That is one of the things about
[16:08] people in their 30s compared about
[16:09] people in their 50s like me. You have to
[16:12] spend more time on the news that's
[16:13] happening and less time on the history.
[16:16] The history doesn't matter as much
[16:18] because we're not riding horses anymore.
[16:20] And unfortunately for tariffs and stuff
[16:22] like that, we were riding horses. He did
[16:25] an interview with Darius Dale. I've
[16:27] talked about Darius. He was the only um
[16:29] sellside person that I paid any money
[16:32] for for research. Um I've done Luke
[16:34] Groman as well just because I think both
[16:36] of them get some insights. Uh he
[16:39] interviewed him for 30 minutes. In this
[16:41] 30 minutes, there is more in here in
[16:44] terms of the conversation than anything
[16:46] I heard in those two podcasts by far.
[16:48] And the reason is because Dale stresses
[16:52] investors don't need to be the smartest,
[16:53] just disciplined and willing to do the
[16:55] work. the administration is saying its
[16:57] policy path and those who follow the
[16:59] playbook, long risk assets, Bitcoin are
[17:02] outperforming. He goes through these
[17:04] reasons and I'm not going to go through
[17:06] everything here. His fight with the
[17:07] institutions at the Fed, the housing
[17:11] market, which I'm going to get into,
[17:12] which is the most important thing, and
[17:14] they talk about this 3% inflation is the
[17:17] new percent. The Fed raised their
[17:20] inflation target. I don't know if they
[17:23] would have announced it then every would
[17:24] have said buy stocks, buy gold,
[17:26] whatever. Well, that's what's happening.
[17:27] They just didn't announce it. So, if you
[17:29] go through that, you'll get it. Now,
[17:31] expand on the housing options they
[17:33] mentioned, and this is what I want to
[17:34] get into. Treat housing as a national
[17:36] emergency. That's what Besson talked
[17:38] about this week. Support a broad
[17:40] economic boom. Fixed housing is seen as
[17:43] a lever to lift the middle and lower
[17:45] income, directly addressing the K-shaped
[17:47] economy that Trump often highlighted in
[17:49] his rhetoric. the policy options
[17:51] discussed,
[17:53] all of the things that they say could be
[17:55] done.
[17:57] And what does Darius Dale say? High
[18:00] confidence in the action, repeatedly
[18:01] stressing that the administration says
[18:03] what it will do and then it does it. It
[18:05] says it wants rates to be lowered. It
[18:07] forces the Fed into a corner. People
[18:09] disagree with him. They say Fed
[18:10] independence is going to lead to bond
[18:11] sales. It's going to lead to stock
[18:12] market falls. It's going to lead to
[18:14] Turkey. He compares this approach to
[18:16] China's command style policymaking. Oh,
[18:18] another reason to be bearish. No. If
[18:20] they declare housing as a priority, even
[18:23] via emergency powers, which I'll get
[18:24] into, investors should assume policy
[18:27] will follow. Dale warns investors it
[18:29] would be a mistake to ass seemed they
[18:31] won't happen. The administration has
[18:32] both the urgency and the political
[18:35] incentive, and I'll even say the
[18:38] political ability, market implication,
[18:40] investors should expect an eventual
[18:42] housing turn as government policy levers
[18:44] will be pulled. That's the most
[18:46] important thing of the week. And the
[18:48] reason is I showed this two weeks ago.
[18:51] These are the winners in the industrial
[18:53] space. All of them are related to AI and
[18:55] the data center buildout in terms of the
[18:57] first phase. These are related to jobs,
[19:01] in terms of the lower-end consumer, in
[19:04] terms of consumption, in terms of
[19:07] housing. This is what Donald Trump was
[19:09] elected on. If these go higher, even if
[19:12] these continue to go higher, which is
[19:14] normally not the case at the beginning
[19:15] when you have stuff like GE Vernova up
[19:17] 99%.
[19:19] These things have had an easy ride. This
[19:20] has been in play for a while. If he
[19:23] stimulates the housing side, it is a
[19:25] massive shift. And again, it will add to
[19:27] the PMI side. And that's why I mentioned
[19:29] it weeks ago. Bill Pi has been alluding
[19:32] to this. They've talked about getting
[19:33] rid of capital gains tax. They've talked
[19:35] about all types of things. And I
[19:37] mentioned this is a major issue in the
[19:39] midterms. So if it's a major issue in
[19:42] the midterms, the administration keeps
[19:44] finding ways to do it. Whether you agree
[19:45] with it or not, that's not the point. Do
[19:47] they bring up AI? AI comes up briefly,
[19:49] but it's not the central theme. Oh,
[19:50] okay. So I guess Darius doesn't do it
[19:52] either. But wait, while AI isn't
[19:54] discussed in depth,
[19:57] it is flagged as one of the drivers of
[19:59] structural economic change that makes
[20:01] the Fed's current policy framework
[20:03] misaligned with reality. That is the key
[20:05] thing. You have to mention that AI is
[20:08] screwing with everything and it is
[20:11] impacting the way things were done in
[20:13] the past because when you had higher
[20:15] growth you would get job creation. We
[20:18] are not going to see a massive job
[20:20] creation this time even if nominal GDP
[20:22] stays at fives. So for all of you
[20:24] sitting there saying this is going to
[20:25] end badly. I'm telling you we're going
[20:28] to sit around this level because of AI.
[20:31] Trump weighs weighs declaring national
[20:33] house emergency. So they're talking
[20:35] about it. It was something that was
[20:37] mentioned about uh it's a critical leg
[20:39] of Republicans 2026 midterm election
[20:41] platform.
[20:44] What does declaring a national emergency
[20:46] allow him to do? Basically anything he
[20:49] wants. So a national emergency. So you
[20:53] go through it. These are all the things
[20:54] that he can do. You can read them on
[20:56] your own.
[20:57] Expand sanctions authority. Use
[20:59] industrial and emergency powers. force
[21:01] companies to prioritize contracts like
[21:04] for AI data center buildouts. Control
[21:06] allocation of electricity, oil or gas.
[21:08] If electricity prices go higher, there
[21:10] will be a national emergency declared.
[21:12] Override environmental restrictions. I
[21:14] say that because once you start talking
[21:16] about inflation, just remember they will
[21:18] find ways to contain this. Override
[21:20] environmental restrictions for national
[21:21] security purposes. If a housing
[21:24] emergency is declared, Trump could.
[21:25] These are all ones that were just
[21:28] created by chat GPT. When I asked the
[21:31] question about a national emergency,
[21:33] which ones has he already declared? Here
[21:36] are the ones he's already declared.
[21:39] National emergencies, they've been
[21:40] happening consistently. This one is in
[21:42] the courts right now in terms of the
[21:43] trade the the trade side. He just did
[21:46] crime.
[21:48] Trump has done nine plus in one year.
[21:52] Donald Trump let did seven in four
[21:54] years. So that was the the fastest pace
[21:57] the last time. So he's done these
[21:59] before. This is what he does. Obama did
[22:01] them, but it was 12 over 8 years. Well,
[22:03] uh, he's declared nine national
[22:06] emergencies in less than 9 months. So,
[22:09] in effect, these emergency declarations
[22:11] can be forms of government stimulus.
[22:13] Yes, they can be function as powerful
[22:15] forms of targeted government stimulus.
[22:17] So, whether you agree with the way
[22:18] China's doing things in the case of AI,
[22:21] I've said this before, in the case of
[22:23] all of the things we're talking about,
[22:25] yes. Are are is he acting like China? I
[22:28] I I don't know other way to say it. He's
[22:29] making sure that he fulfills the
[22:32] campaign promises that got in. So, you
[22:34] can argue with them. You can be academic
[22:36] and go through and say this is going to
[22:37] be bad. You can be bearish and maybe
[22:39] you'll be right. But the reality is
[22:40] you're doing it at a time. Well, the
[22:42] market's going higher, profit margins
[22:43] are going higher, earnings are going
[22:44] higher, and inflation is not at 9%.
[22:49] Marco Papic, my boy, this is really
[22:51] interesting. In my view, the White House
[22:52] is laser focused on unleashing the
[22:54] massive amount of wealth stored in US
[22:56] housing equity. I fully expect them to
[22:58] find a way to let the floodgates open.
[22:59] Whatever it takes. Marco's in his 30s.
[23:02] It's what it takes, guys. It's what it
[23:04] takes. Household durables. Hm. Here's
[23:07] the chart. Wow. It's been rallying
[23:09] strongly despite a crappy housing market
[23:12] and no PMIs. H I like it when charts are
[23:16] going higher. Sentiment isn't and data
[23:19] isn't. Here is the 4-year chart. The
[23:22] John Rog special. He loves housing. He
[23:25] loves small caps. No wonder why. This is
[23:29] Home Depot.
[23:31] The white line about to break out.
[23:34] Overlaid with IWM or Russell. Why would
[23:38] you try to pick a triple top when we're
[23:41] about to cut rates and PMIs are about to
[23:44] go higher and the government is about to
[23:46] help the housing market? Figure it out
[23:48] on your own. I remind you, look at all
[23:52] of these names.
[23:54] come back in three months and see what's
[23:56] gone on. I guess everything could fall
[23:58] apart. We could have a recession. I'm
[24:01] I'm gonna go the other direction. Um,
[24:03] this is the PMI overlaid with that
[24:06] chart. Again, as a reminder, I did this
[24:07] two weeks ago. So, this is what happens
[24:10] in PMIs is there's always some either
[24:12] move to safety, there's some move to AI,
[24:15] which is safety right now. Wherever the
[24:16] growth is, you move to. So, this is
[24:18] inverted. This is momentum of
[24:20] industrials, which has started to pick
[24:22] up. It was down sharply. Uh this is
[24:24] inverted. Uh it was down sharply on
[24:26] Friday on the back of the payroll
[24:28] numbers. Uh for anyone who hasn't seen
[24:31] this, uh you know, I I went to 22V to
[24:34] basically connect AI to macro and
[24:36] crypto. Uh I didn't, you know, I knew
[24:39] that I'd be there. Colin Fenton and John
[24:41] Ro I've known for 20 plus years. I love
[24:43] them. They're great. They're both byside
[24:45] people. We are going to focus a lot of
[24:47] attention. I think this is one of the
[24:50] most important things for mutual funds
[24:51] in particular. If there is a shift and
[24:53] if these charts are telling us a story,
[24:55] if I'm right on AI, there is going to be
[24:57] a massive shift away from the MAG7 and
[25:00] into a lot of names that have no
[25:03] liquidity. They are starting to show up.
[25:06] I will do more and more of these in
[25:07] terms of showing you names that are
[25:09] trading at a dollar at $5 that have now
[25:12] suddenly had back orders of things
[25:14] related to AI and data centers that are
[25:17] going to be the buildout. So the power
[25:18] trade and this is around energy but this
[25:21] is really more on power. We're going to
[25:23] define power because it's not just
[25:25] energy. It's batteries, it's storage,
[25:27] it's boilers, it's uh transformers, it's
[25:29] I can go through a list, but instead if
[25:32] you come you can see us. We're speaking
[25:33] about this on Tuesday. Um I wrote this
[25:36] paper this week, efficiency verse
[25:38] exponential demand. If you didn't read
[25:39] it, um I'll just read you this line.
[25:43] Efficiency is the most overused word in
[25:45] AI. For those fading AI, like most macro
[25:48] people, efficiency is hope. For those
[25:50] riding AI, the momentum crowd,
[25:52] efficiency is fear, we will use up
[25:56] everything for the foreseeable future.
[25:58] Will that change at some point? Yes, but
[26:00] not in the next few years. And that's
[26:02] more than enough time for everyone to
[26:03] move their portfolio and to trade. GPT5,
[26:07] which came out, power appetite consuming
[26:09] energy like two to three nuclear
[26:11] reactors. That's what I highlighted in
[26:13] the uh in that article was just to say
[26:15] that we have so much demand coming. It
[26:19] will not stop for the foreseeable future
[26:21] and any efficiency gains which are
[26:23] happening every day are being gobbled up
[26:26] by the insatiable demand that is still
[26:27] necessary. Data centers that don't exist
[26:29] yet are already haunting the grid. You
[26:31] should go read this article. It was out
[26:32] this week. Um there's more coming. We
[26:35] did GPT5. Well, now Google's going to
[26:37] try and up them with Gemini 3 coming
[26:39] out. It's shaping up to be an incredibly
[26:42] performant model. Gemini is starting to
[26:45] kick ass. I use it and I'm going to
[26:47] bring it up more going forward. Uh Musk
[26:51] claims Gro 5 AI could be true. AGI by
[26:53] year end. I bring this up because it
[26:56] doesn't stop. We're just going to keep
[26:57] going and going. Apple demands suppliers
[27:00] this week. Switch to robotics for
[27:01] manufacturing. More of the job
[27:03] situation. This has to happen. It's
[27:06] going to happen. Uh Michael Symbolist
[27:09] put this out today. The reason I wanted
[27:10] to bring it up, he goes through these
[27:12] capex numbers are enormous. Just look at
[27:14] the hundreds of billions that are coming
[27:15] through. All the things that make him up
[27:18] and then being predominantly these guys
[27:20] the contribution to GDP how it's growing
[27:23] while the other part is there. This is
[27:25] the macro community down here focused on
[27:27] recession. This is the part they're
[27:28] leaving out which continues to grow. It
[27:30] surpassed personal consumption
[27:32] expenditures. Trump is focused on this.
[27:34] He wants this to go higher. And then the
[27:37] danger to these which he brings up as
[27:39] well is that we are getting into insane
[27:41] territory as capex and RD is a
[27:43] percentage of revenues. This is the ROC
[27:45] argument. This ROIC this is where I get
[27:49] worried for the mag 7. I'll go more in
[27:51] depth soon. Peter Diamandis moonshots. I
[27:53] say it every week. The only thing not
[27:56] the only if you're going to watch one AI
[27:59] thing every week this is it. They go
[28:01] through the entire week's stuff.
[28:04] Lamas colossal data centers. Um, for
[28:07] those of you who've never looked at
[28:09] Colossus or go watch a documentary on on
[28:12] YouTube. Um, the main point is that he's
[28:14] finishing his second one. Uh, it goes
[28:17] through powers of bottleneck. They talk
[28:19] about it all the different things.
[28:21] Energy AI is energy limited. They go
[28:23] through the Grock stuff. They go through
[28:24] the talent wars. Everything along those
[28:26] lines. Google's nano banana. So, if you
[28:29] haven't heard of nanobanana and the
[28:30] importance of it, you're going to get a
[28:32] little bit on this. You got to pay
[28:33] attention to these things. So, Gemini
[28:35] released it. Nano Banana disrupts
[28:38] Photoshop. They talk about it. Google
[28:39] Translate came out as well. Disrupts
[28:42] Dualingo. Go look at what happened in
[28:44] Dualingo and go look at what's happened
[28:46] to Adobe over this. I've talked about
[28:47] software. Long power for me is the same
[28:50] as short software. Same trade. Texas
[28:52] Hedge. This is the trade you want to
[28:54] have on long power. You want to be short
[28:56] software. You want to make them equal
[28:58] weight, but you can be short Microsoft
[28:59] as well. I'll go through that too. But
[29:01] you want to basically believe that the
[29:03] transfer that we've seen in market cap
[29:05] away from power and into software, which
[29:07] is what's happened since 2007 and the
[29:10] release of the iPhone, everyone is
[29:12] sitting and overweight these things.
[29:13] They will underperform,
[29:16] underperform going forward, not
[29:17] collapse. The Mag 7 are not going to
[29:19] collapse, but they are going to
[29:20] underperform in my opinion. They go
[29:22] through Nvidia and some of the risk
[29:24] that's rising and they bring up the
[29:25] Chinese chip makers. I'm going to bring
[29:27] up some other stuff, uh, which I brought
[29:29] up last week as well. Tesla optimist
[29:31] shift to vision only training. They go
[29:32] through this. I've talked about this as
[29:34] the most important thing right now is
[29:36] the next stage of AI. They go through
[29:39] electricity prices spiking. AI's natural
[29:42] limit is power. There was a debate and
[29:44] one guy said recursive efficiency
[29:46] breakthroughs possibly reversing the
[29:48] demand shock. This is what is 100% true
[29:52] and it's already happening. I've talked
[29:53] about recursive efficiency being the
[29:55] thing that both increases demand, but
[29:57] what it means is that eventually AI will
[30:00] get so good that it'll start fixing the
[30:03] inefficiencies in its code. It'll fix
[30:05] the inefficiencies and come up with
[30:06] inefficiency fixes for everything. It'll
[30:09] actually fix the energy problem, but
[30:11] that's not coming in the near term.
[30:14] Nano Banana. Okay, let's get through
[30:15] this. Is Nano Banana a risk to Adobe's
[30:17] business model?
[30:19] Unlike other MLS that struggle with
[30:21] manufacturing facial features and
[30:23] identity across, Nano Banana excels at
[30:25] preserving character likeness throughout
[30:26] transformations,
[30:28] Adobe's creative cloud generates over 13
[30:31] billion in annual revenue from 37
[30:33] million subscribers. Nano Banana
[30:35] threatens this foundation. So I'm going
[30:37] to show you some of the work of Nano
[30:39] Banana in a second. Democratizing
[30:41] editing, eliminating learning curves,
[30:44] and it's free.
[30:46] This is from Gemini. This is just one of
[30:48] the tools they have like deep research.
[30:50] Yep, there's me at the US Open. All I
[30:53] did was take a photo of me in one of my
[30:57] grungy clothes and said, "Put me at the
[31:00] US Open hitting a backhand
[31:05] and then show me holding the trophy." It
[31:09] does it in seconds. It's free. Dolingo.
[31:14] Dolingo's business model heavily depends
[31:16] on converting free users to paid
[31:17] subscribers. Key vulnerabilities include
[31:19] only 8.6% of Dualingo's users are paid
[31:23] subscribers, but they generate 80%. This
[31:25] whole model is dead. All of them are
[31:29] dead. That's why this is the what I
[31:31] want. I want to be long Chevron short.
[31:33] Salesforce.com which reported earnings
[31:35] this week missed. Everyone's trying to
[31:37] pick the bottom of software. I read it
[31:39] in exposts all day long. Everyone has a
[31:42] mean reversion bent. Everyone seems to
[31:44] think that they can just jump into
[31:46] something that it's overdone and that AI
[31:48] is a hype. Like I said, the fading of AI
[31:51] will cost you more money. You have to
[31:53] spend the time in terms of thinking
[31:55] about it. And the only way you can do
[31:56] that is you can't read the bank's
[31:57] research. You have to read 22Vs in mine.
[32:00] And I'm not doing that to pat myself on
[32:01] the back. I spend hours of time using it
[32:04] and hours of time listening to podcasts
[32:06] every week. And then I give you guys the
[32:08] playbook and I give you the information.
[32:10] Chevron over Salesforce.com. That is the
[32:13] thought process. That is the trade. So,
[32:16] here's Microsoft relative to the S&P.
[32:19] This is a weekly MACD.
[32:22] We just got a sell signal. It's come
[32:24] down sharply right here. I don't want to
[32:26] show how big of a move this is, but this
[32:28] is a very strong move. Uh, when you do
[32:30] it on a rate of change basis, uh,
[32:32] relative to history, we normally don't
[32:34] get these types of moves. So Microsoft,
[32:36] which is the second biggest company in
[32:38] the world, is underperforming. And the
[32:41] biggest company in the world, which I
[32:43] highlighted last week on their earnings,
[32:45] you not only have declining revenue,
[32:47] you're starting to get worries. This
[32:48] one, you not only have again a MACD weak
[32:52] sell signal. It's a divergence relative
[32:55] to price.
[32:57] I would be very, very worried if these
[32:59] were my two biggest longs. and every
[33:00] single person and every mutual fund who
[33:02] is benchmarked has those as their two
[33:04] biggest longs. I think their alpha days
[33:07] are going to be challenging and again
[33:09] I'll go through one of the things that
[33:11] says that right now it's happening this
[33:13] is white line here is an equal this is
[33:16] the S&P 500 equal weight semi I created
[33:18] this in Bloomberg uh we were up again on
[33:22] Friday but more importantly as Nvidia is
[33:24] underperforming the S&P
[33:27] semis are still going higher meaning the
[33:30] equal weight semis which has a lot of
[33:32] small cap stuff on it I've highlighted
[33:34] uh LSCC C on here lattis semiconductor.
[33:38] The thing is it's the tide that lifts
[33:41] all boats and before Nvidia had a a do a
[33:45] do a dominant market chat. They have a
[33:46] monopoly on GPUs. They might be able to
[33:49] extend this. they might be able to do
[33:51] something, but it is not as safe a
[33:53] trade. And I think you have to build
[33:54] that risk into the stock price and it's
[33:56] still trading at a high enough multiple
[33:58] that people can start to believe that if
[34:00] they can't do that, maybe they should be
[34:02] trading off next year's in the following
[34:04] earnings with more and more competition.
[34:06] And the reason is Nvidia's chip
[34:08] dominance, recent competitive threats.
[34:10] These are recent China's rising chip
[34:12] makers. So, we've seen the whole thing
[34:13] with China and the US. But what probably
[34:16] hasn't happened and I'll go through more
[34:18] China here. China has made huge huge
[34:20] advancements on their chip side and
[34:21] they've made huge adv huge advancements
[34:23] on figuring out how to be more efficient
[34:25] with what they're doing. You can't not
[34:28] see that they're probably going to be
[34:29] further ahead on this as we go forward
[34:31] like all the other chip makers are.
[34:33] Google's TPU commercial puss Davidson
[34:36] analyst released a report on September
[34:37] 2nd suggesting their TPU business could
[34:39] be worth 900 billion if spun off. You're
[34:42] starting to get more and more messages
[34:45] of them allowing other people to use the
[34:47] TPUs.
[34:49] So, you're getting competition from
[34:51] there. Broadcom was up huge on Friday
[34:53] with a partnership with Open AI. Again,
[34:57] market disrupt. This partnership
[34:58] represents a direct challenge to
[34:59] Nvidia's inference chip dominance.
[35:03] Tesla announced a 16.5 billion dollar
[35:05] deal. They designed their own chip.
[35:07] Again, these companies are designing the
[35:09] role and they're the ones with the
[35:10] capex. Is there going to be other places
[35:12] that need Nvidia chips? Of course. But
[35:15] Nvidia is moving on to something related
[35:16] to humanoids. It's moving on to native
[35:19] uh devices. They're trying to gather
[35:21] that. If they do that, they'll get
[35:23] another wave of this. But that is very
[35:24] different than what they've had before
[35:26] and they're at such a big level that
[35:28] even if it starts working, if the
[35:30] numbers don't get huge very quickly,
[35:32] it's not going to help them. So, I would
[35:34] just keep it in there. Go through. You
[35:36] can read these things on your own.
[35:38] These four developments collectively
[35:40] signal a fundamental shift in the AI
[35:41] chip e chip ecosystem from Nvidia
[35:44] dominated supply to diversified custom
[35:46] silicon solutions. Uh again
[35:49] use chat GPT. Okay. Two podcasts again
[35:52] that focused on China. The entire BG2
[35:56] one was on China. These guys even when
[35:59] they uh I'd say about a quarter to a
[36:01] third of it was on China or indirectly
[36:03] on China. China has made open source an
[36:06] explicit policy vector. You have to
[36:08] understand that what they have done is
[36:10] opensource. They are competing with the
[36:11] mag 7. So the mag 7 Google for example
[36:14] 90 plus% dominance in Germany across the
[36:17] globe in search. That is not going to be
[36:19] the case with AI. China has made their
[36:22] stuff cheaper and their open-source
[36:24] models are close or better than the open
[36:26] source models that the US is offering.
[36:28] That's why llamas made this whole big
[36:30] push into ASI. Will all countries use
[36:33] Chinese-made AI? No. But if all of Asia
[36:35] does, well, that hurts the market share.
[36:39] You can only lose when you're on top.
[36:41] You can't take more market share. So,
[36:43] the competition from having cheaper
[36:45] models that are almost as good and
[36:48] continuing to grow fast in China where
[36:51] they have endless energy. And I will
[36:54] tell you, using ChachiPT all the time, I
[36:56] get very frustrated with how I am now
[36:58] restricted in ways that I never was
[37:00] before. And this is happening on most of
[37:03] the models. I used to get 50page deep
[37:05] research reports easily. Now Gemini is
[37:08] the only one that I can get them from.
[37:09] That's why I'm saying as all of these
[37:12] models start choosing some kind of
[37:14] vertical that they want to focus on
[37:15] finance for perplexity or uh the
[37:18] consumer for open AI. This is a this is
[37:21] a battle that's not as easy as it was.
[37:23] And China has wanted other battles in
[37:25] this. So using the open source and they
[37:28] go through this they highlight Ford and
[37:31] I'll show you some of this the mismatch
[37:33] China challengers capture share more
[37:35] quickly putting pressure on MIG 7
[37:37] margins and future revenue growth. Um
[37:39] there is competition and it's going to
[37:41] be there in older industries like cars
[37:44] or steel dominance played out over
[37:46] decades. The problem is with this one,
[37:47] if you get ahead in the models or if
[37:50] you're really cheap while everyone is
[37:52] growing rapidly, this is growing like
[37:54] wildfire, the Chinese are willing to
[37:57] lose money now in order to dominate
[37:58] later. It gives them an advantage and
[38:00] it's much harder with a private business
[38:02] even though open AI and throp all those
[38:05] companies are losing money. Are the mag
[38:07] seven who are public companies willing
[38:09] to lose money if that's what starts to
[38:12] happen? And the answer is absolutely
[38:14] not. So I would just keep it in the back
[38:16] of your mind that this is going to be
[38:17] pressure coming from all directions. Um
[38:20] China's industrial they have an
[38:21] extremely sophisticated market driven
[38:22] approach on how to deal. They get
[38:23] obviously the government support. Um in
[38:26] 2006
[38:28] Huin Tao
[38:30] gave in his speech the boxes that were
[38:32] national security issues like
[38:34] semiconductors, rare earths,
[38:35] pharmaceutical APIs. Doesn't it sound
[38:38] like we're doing that now 20 years
[38:39] later?
[38:41] It's happening right now in terms of
[38:43] global dumping with BYD. It's disrupting
[38:46] American, German, European autom
[38:48] manufacturers ability to compete.
[38:51] And if you haven't read this story from
[38:53] June, Ford CEO says China's EV progress
[38:56] is the most humbling thing he's ever
[38:58] seen
[39:01] on BYD on a Xiaomi uh car. We flew one
[39:05] from ch from Shanghai to Chicago and
[39:06] I've been driving it for six months now
[39:08] and I don't want to give it up. This is
[39:09] the Ford CEO. It's the most humbling
[39:12] thing I've ever seen. 70% of all EVs in
[39:14] the world are made in China. They have
[39:15] far superior invehicle technology,
[39:18] meaning you walk in with your phone and
[39:19] everything lights up. You don't have to
[39:21] connect via Bluetooth. You don't have to
[39:22] do that. There's a variety of things you
[39:24] can go watch online. And their cost is
[39:26] far superior to what I've seen in the
[39:28] West. That really helps in a world where
[39:32] there's very few wealthy people. And
[39:34] that's the distribution of wealth
[39:35] problem. And that's the plate that Ty is
[39:37] targeting. the economic Fed versus the
[39:38] inflation target of the world. I just
[39:40] want to remind people again if the mag
[39:43] seven is under pressure at the same time
[39:45] that power is where all the money's
[39:46] going PMI and housing and everything
[39:48] along a sectoral regime shift is more
[39:50] powerful. It usually reflects dramatic
[39:52] changes in monetary policy. The Fed is
[39:55] going to cut rates while the S&P is near
[39:57] 1% while the government is saying they
[40:00] want to lower it more. We have labor
[40:01] weakening and inflation staying high and
[40:04] they're going to choose labor. fiscal
[40:06] policy, national emergency measures, the
[40:08] AI action plan, whatever you want, and
[40:10] the targeting of housing at the same
[40:13] time as innovation, AI. I believe we're
[40:14] in the early stages of one right now.
[40:16] Call me, talk to me. This is what's
[40:19] happened over time with momentum. When
[40:21] you get one of those points, and I've
[40:23] shown this before, we didn't fall here.
[40:25] We're beginning to here. I believe we're
[40:28] going to see momentum shift. There'll be
[40:30] new leaders going forward. Um, one of
[40:32] the new innovation leader going forward
[40:34] over the Mag 7 will be crypto, will be
[40:37] Bitcoin. Uh, I highlighted this in here.
[40:40] Uh, someone highlighted to me and was
[40:42] angry that I haven't disclosed that I'
[40:44] I've been wrong in Bitcoin. At this
[40:46] point this year, I thought Bitcoin would
[40:48] already be over 150,000. It is currently
[40:51] 110 as we do this. I have been
[40:52] completely wrong on how far I thought it
[40:55] would go this year. Uh I can give you
[40:57] theories why which I go through here but
[40:59] that was the point of this is basically
[41:00] to say I still think it is the the do
[41:03] the horse you want to own in this race.
[41:05] Uh and maybe it starts after the rate
[41:07] cuts. Maybe it starts after people
[41:09] realize what I'm talking about here in
[41:10] terms of PMIs going higher and cutting
[41:12] rates. I don't really care the network
[41:14] effects of stable coins and the size of
[41:16] the asset class. But more importantly,
[41:18] if the MAG7 aren't working, people need
[41:20] to have innovation beta in their
[41:21] portfolio. The only large cap of over a
[41:24] trillion dollars aside from Tesla that
[41:26] you'll be able to own that can provide
[41:28] you the beta that you would want if the
[41:29] Mag 7 aren't doing it for you is
[41:31] Bitcoin. Um now on to Alon Mus real
[41:35] quick.
[41:37] Trillion dollars just like a a football
[41:39] player. Here's here are the milestones
[41:41] he needs to hit uh in there. You can
[41:43] love him, you can hate him, but do not
[41:45] bet against him. He has hated I would
[41:48] say it's 20 to1 in terms of people that
[41:49] have reached out to me to say you're
[41:51] wrong about Tesla. you're wrong about
[41:52] Alon Musk. I I don't know how people can
[41:55] fade the guy, but I'll leave it at that.
[41:57] Um, if you haven't listened to Andre
[42:00] Karpathy, um, this interview, which is
[42:04] almost 4 hours, um, he worked at Tesla.
[42:07] He was part of the vision thing. I've
[42:08] said this before. I wrote a paper on it.
[42:10] I'm going to say it again. What Tesla is
[42:12] trying to do with vision only for the
[42:16] robo taxis the success of it is a major
[42:19] game changer and has huge implications
[42:21] for everything on the AS side. It is the
[42:23] next AI part. It is the advancement of
[42:25] humanoids. If it works again you've got
[42:28] humanoids that can be just like a sector
[42:30] specialist. They can be trained to do
[42:32] one thing but then if you ask a
[42:34] industrial person to go into biotech
[42:36] they can't do it. In a great generalist
[42:38] humanoid they can do anything. What
[42:40] these guys are trying to do is not be a
[42:43] sector specialist like Whimo, which can
[42:45] only do it on a grid and can only do it
[42:47] in a place where they have GPS. What
[42:50] they're trying to do is be able to do it
[42:51] on Mars. I'm going to keep saying again
[42:53] and again, but if you listen to him, not
[42:55] just now, Carpathy is worth listening to
[42:58] and following in tweets on all this. Uh,
[43:00] okay, real quick. Apps Tesla robo taxi,
[43:04] head of Uber.
[43:06] Tesla Robo Taxi app downloads outpaced
[43:09] Uber across all rolling 30-day periods
[43:11] by 40% and bested Whimo's download day
[43:14] ever. Robo Taxi is live in San Jose.
[43:17] Yes, that's California where they
[43:18] restrict everything. $23 verse Uber's 37
[43:22] for a ride downtown. Again, this is just
[43:24] starting. It's official. No one saw it
[43:26] coming. Tesla gets secret permission
[43:27] from California DMV to test autonomous
[43:29] cars.
[43:31] For those of you who will be out in
[43:34] Vegas uh to see him, please stop by.
[43:36] I'll be there only briefly. Uh but I
[43:38] will be on stage actually with John Ro
[43:41] um at the event. Uh I'll be there
[43:43] Wednesday and then I'll come back
[43:45] immediately and then I'll be with my boy
[43:47] Pomp on uh on Friday at his investor
[43:50] event. If you're going to be at that one
[43:52] uh or if you want tickets, you can reach
[43:53] out to those guys. I'll see you all
[43:55] there. Final thing for the parents out
[43:58] there. Um and again, I think I've
[43:59] highlighted this a couple times now.
[44:01] This is a really good podcast if you
[44:03] were going to listen to two AI podcasts
[44:04] as a macro person to be on top of things
[44:06] and then to use AI to make sure that you
[44:08] understood everything coming out of it.
[44:09] This would be the second one behind
[44:10] moonshots, the artificial intelligence
[44:13] show. Um, this is important for parents.
[44:15] First of all, they went through the
[44:16] Stanford report. That's one of the
[44:18] reasons why you should listen. They
[44:19] basically say it's a good report. Um, it
[44:22] is true. They go through and say it's
[44:24] not just um, in their opinion, these are
[44:27] AI guys that are in the business of
[44:29] this. Uh it's not just the early uh the
[44:32] college kids that are getting hurt.
[44:33] Middle management will be getting hurt
[44:34] this year. They go through nano banana.
[44:36] They point out that the buzz and how
[44:38] easily non-experts can access advanced
[44:39] editing which pressures incumbents
[44:42] creative tools to evolve. They built a
[44:45] tool the jobs GPT tool which you guys
[44:49] like I did can put on your own chat GPT.
[44:53] What this is is it goes in, you launch
[44:56] it. So you go to this website, you
[44:58] launch it. Once you launch it, it's part
[45:00] of your own chatpt on your own box. Then
[45:04] you go in and you type in
[45:07] the job that you want to check. So in
[45:08] this case, I put in coder. It shows you
[45:11] the exposure level you have to AI. Is
[45:15] your job worth having? It allows you to
[45:18] go in and help your kids figure out
[45:20] whether they're choosing a major,
[45:22] choosing a job, which is going to be
[45:24] basically obsolete. How much of it's
[45:27] going to be obsolete. This one, a
[45:29] lawyer, and just to finish off the
[45:32] episode since I know we have a lot of
[45:33] these hedge fund analyst, difficult job
[45:35] to have. All right. Uh, that's it. I'm
[45:38] glad to be back. Uh, look forward to
[45:40] hearing the comments. And you guys, uh,
[45:42] hit the subscribe button, get it to your
[45:45] friends, reach out to 22V. I'll see you
[45:48] guys soon.
