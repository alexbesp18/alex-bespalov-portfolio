[00:00] let's get right to it uh continuation of
[00:03] the momentum unwind I'll give an update
[00:05] on that uh mag 7 correction it's been uh
[00:11] it's been leading us lower uh so I'll
[00:13] kind of go through what we hit
[00:15] historical context and was that enough
[00:19] uh I'm going to go through a sentiment
[00:20] collapse uh sentiment is always a hard
[00:22] thing to measure uh I show you guys you
[00:25] know a few things but I think it's
[00:27] pretty clear that Trader sentiment uh
[00:30] has come down
[00:31] significantly also economic sentiment
[00:33] which I'll get into later despite all of
[00:36] that I'm going to go through how the
[00:38] breath in the market and the rest of the
[00:40] world just are not part of this so this
[00:44] absolutely seems like a momentum unwind
[00:46] at this point uh Nvidia earnings came
[00:49] out and everyone was waiting on it it
[00:51] there was a you know sell the news type
[00:53] event and then it bounced back on on
[00:56] Friday I'm going to go through the
[00:58] Nvidia earnings and just highlight some
[01:00] stuff uh but also highlight how
[01:02] important the stock has been and why I
[01:04] think we are at a regime shift but I I
[01:07] also think Nvidia very likely has has
[01:09] bottomed here just based on the pattern
[01:12] and if we do get another low I think
[01:14] that's going to be what's going to have
[01:15] to happen to to really get the market to
[01:17] extend what's happened uh which is
[01:19] possible but I'll go through that the
[01:21] the economy and then uh Bitcoin on the
[01:23] back of it so let's just uh jump right
[01:28] into it so I highlighted this last week
[01:31] I just want to make sure there's there's
[01:32] a couple things so the momentum this was
[01:34] through last week we had a bad Monday
[01:37] and then we kind of back and filled in
[01:39] here uh so it was two weekday in a row
[01:42] that took us to the lowest level since
[01:45] before the election more importantly
[01:48] momentum has been kind of dying in here
[01:51] and it was dying really from February
[01:53] into July so except for this one period
[01:56] leading into the election where you had
[01:59] this massive move you've kind of worked
[02:01] it off uh in my opinion so I think that
[02:04] was the end of the momentum unwind and
[02:07] the reason is because of how dramatic
[02:09] some of these names were and I'll go
[02:11] through it I did write a paper on it
[02:13] this week just in in a lot of detail
[02:15] about the momentum uh the history of it
[02:18] why it's an important macro factor to
[02:20] watch uh if we had I thought we were
[02:22] going to go into a
[02:23] recession I think we'd have a lot more
[02:25] room in the momentum unwind but since I
[02:28] don't uh and I'll go through why I think
[02:31] this was really more just a position
[02:33] unwind in things that had worked for
[02:36] really since chat GPT and that's what
[02:38] this was so in terms of the mag 7 uh
[02:41] this was the monthly move um you know
[02:44] one of the worst moves in the last eight
[02:46] years and since chat GPT came out which
[02:50] was right in here we had one week move
[02:52] here in the beginning of January but
[02:53] since then we really hadn't had any
[02:55] weakness and you had all of these plus
[02:58] sides so since chat PT came out in here
[03:01] just count up the amount of Mag 7 plus
[03:04] 10% or even plus 8% and then this was
[03:06] the first one here so I think we you
[03:09] know they're still seeing earnings grow
[03:11] uh yes I think as I've talked about I
[03:13] think they're going to start to
[03:14] underperform where they would have been
[03:17] uh and I think they're not going to be
[03:18] the leaders of the market uh this year
[03:20] but they are still growing earnings and
[03:23] they are reasonably priced for the
[03:25] earning growth that they're seeing so
[03:26] you're going to have to see some kind of
[03:28] collapse and the tariffs not going to
[03:30] impact them there's just when you're
[03:32] trying to get this this is I AI is just
[03:35] too powerful of a story as I've talked
[03:36] about and I don't think people know how
[03:38] to put it into the context of of History
[03:41] uh this is uh just the draw down for the
[03:44] mag 7 so we had a 15% draw down uh we
[03:48] did more believe it or not during the
[03:50] the Yen unwind but the difference is
[03:52] this time there's nothing else moving
[03:54] right now uh and also the mag 7 has been
[03:57] consolidating really since that time
[03:59] they're just hasn't been this explosive
[04:01] move and so what you've had is this is
[04:04] the mag seven relative to the S&P and
[04:07] like I said um most of the move they had
[04:09] was a breakup into the election or just
[04:12] after the election and they gave it all
[04:14] up and so now the mag s relative to the
[04:16] S&P it's not just unchanged since June
[04:19] July really this hasn't been a massive
[04:22] outperformance the way you would have
[04:24] you would have you know thought since
[04:26] June of 23 so I think it it corrected
[04:29] back to the 200 day moving average I
[04:31] think it did what it needed to do at
[04:32] least for
[04:33] now uh relative to the S&P this
[04:37] correction was 10% so uh the only one
[04:40] that was greater was in the 22 period
[04:43] during when rates were being taken
[04:44] higher and their earnings actually did
[04:46] turn negative uh unless we're going to
[04:49] get earnings to turn negative I think an
[04:50] underperform of 10% for companies that
[04:52] are still seeing their earnings grow
[04:54] double digits I think it's just really
[04:56] hard um for it to extend much further
[04:58] without there being economic Fallout and
[05:00] that's really the critical thing you're
[05:02] going to hear from me
[05:03] now the S&P can absolutely have a
[05:05] correction that goes down because it
[05:07] hasn't gone down that much but for the
[05:09] mag 7 to go down a lot more from here
[05:12] there's going to have to be a building
[05:13] of some sort of a recession and that
[05:15] could happen with the tariffs it could
[05:16] happen with what's going on with Doge
[05:18] and spending you've got Steve Cohen out
[05:20] there a lot of people are starting to
[05:21] turn negative uh but again I think AI in
[05:24] the other side tax cuts on the other
[05:25] side and a a belief uh that he can't
[05:29] afford to have the stock market go down
[05:31] doesn't mean it won't uh the technical
[05:33] picture on some of these things are bad
[05:34] so we'll see what happens but I just
[05:36] don't think it's going to happen and
[05:37] we'll go through this week by week and
[05:38] looking but for the time being I think
[05:40] we've done none enough mag 7 relative to
[05:44] the rest of the world isn't even bigger
[05:46] Story I mean this was the third or
[05:49] fourth biggest draw down which again
[05:51] this is when their earnings were
[05:52] negative so there's no negative earnings
[05:54] now and you've had a sharp correction
[05:56] versus the rest of the
[05:57] world everyone was long mag 7 in a
[06:01] variety of different ways everyone was
[06:02] underweight China underweight Europe
[06:04] underweight Emerging Markets underweight
[06:05] everything well we've seen that play out
[06:08] now and have a correction uh I created a
[06:10] speculative uh name basket this has got
[06:13] uh some of the things that I very seldom
[06:14] show here Quantum stocks space
[06:17] stocks uh some crypto stocks uh a whole
[06:21] bunch of just I would say momentum names
[06:23] that have done extremely well since the
[06:25] Fed rate cut you had this big move they
[06:28] gave back 62% they went through the uh
[06:32] or down to the election level in terms
[06:34] of the Gap after uh I still think you
[06:37] know Quantum stocks and a lot of that
[06:38] that's a top for now I think there was a
[06:41] lot of hype in that stuff robotics names
[06:43] things like that I I think at this point
[06:45] until they grow earnings those names
[06:47] which didn't have earnings they were all
[06:49] based on momentum and I think we've
[06:50] crashed the Traders where it's going to
[06:53] take uh the speculators a little bit of
[06:55] time to come back in in terms of Bitcoin
[06:57] I just want to highlight uh I did in the
[06:59] the paper I wrote but Bitcoin is the
[07:01] ultimate momentum the reason I like it
[07:04] more than stocks in the momentum is
[07:06] because whatever the momentum is in
[07:08] terms of beta going higher uh Bitcoin
[07:10] tends to be with it as long as the
[07:11] Market's going higher uh Bitcoin is the
[07:16] the risk asset as I've said I think
[07:18] we're in the final stages of the mag 7
[07:21] as the leaders which means Bitcoin will
[07:23] be the only asset of large size in my
[07:25] opinion possibly outside of gold that
[07:28] drives return turns this year I still
[07:30] think it'll be up significantly this
[07:32] year on the back of stable coins and on
[07:34] the back of the government but it needed
[07:36] to flush out with momentum so if
[07:38] momentum now stabilizes for the people
[07:40] who care about Bitcoin um I'll go
[07:42] through at the end why there's already
[07:43] signs that uh that may have been it
[07:46] salana uh basically did a 50% correction
[07:50] if and that's on a Clos to close basis
[07:52] if you do intraday there was a day where
[07:54] it spiked up towards 300 it had traded a
[07:57] bunch of times Above This level uh it
[07:59] would have been 62% retracement but the
[08:01] main reason I'm showing we've done a
[08:02] correction even in the let's say the
[08:05] second tier uh of crypto names the third
[08:08] tier uh really got destroyed and then
[08:10] when you get into the meme coins even
[08:12] worse uh this is the thing that was
[08:15] surprising and I think people have tried
[08:17] to find ways to ignore it there's no way
[08:19] to ignore this um sentiment has come
[08:21] down I could feel it uh other people I
[08:23] talk to were getting called by people
[08:25] saying what's going on but those are
[08:27] people that traffic in the momentum BAS
[08:29] names that have been trying to make
[08:31] money on those whether they're day
[08:32] Traders whatever the case is the
[08:34] sentiment for Traders for the AI I AI II
[08:39] uh the be level jump to the peaks of 22
[08:43] I I mean there's just no other way
[08:44] around it including the worst of the
[08:47] 0809 period so we did get a jump uh in
[08:51] bearishness and it matches up with the
[08:53] conference board so if you remember I
[08:54] showed at the beginning of the year the
[08:56] conference board stock percent of people
[08:58] that think stocks would inre increase
[08:59] this year and it was at the highest
[09:02] level in history uh and this goes back a
[09:04] long way well it just dropped seven
[09:06] points which is the largest monthly drop
[09:09] since the worst of covid when we shut
[09:11] everything down so anyone who's saying
[09:14] sentiment isn't negative at this point
[09:17] uh they're not paying attention we had a
[09:19] big drop off in sentiment uh it doesn't
[09:21] mean it can't sit down here I just want
[09:23] to highlight the bull sentiment
[09:25] collapsed but we stayed down here in 22
[09:27] for a long time and this is
[09:29] year-over-year S&P and this is basically
[09:31] what I highlighted at the beginning of
[09:33] the year was when you have sentiment
[09:36] kind of sitting up here which is where
[09:37] that cons conference board was year-over
[09:40] year S&P needs to kind of slow down and
[09:42] go down and that's the kind of year I
[09:44] thought we'd have I didn't think we'd
[09:45] have the 25% year I thought it would be
[09:48] much more choppy with Trump as president
[09:49] particularly with the policies trying to
[09:51] get through and I think that's exactly
[09:52] what we're seeing we don't know uh the
[09:55] extent of the tariffs that are going to
[09:56] happen but we do know that you can't be
[09:58] playing with risk at the levels that you
[10:00] had uh I'm going to start showing this
[10:03] more and more because it tends to match
[10:04] up with what we saw in AI which is this
[10:07] is the crypto fear greed index I showed
[10:09] it um before it collapsed to lower than
[10:12] it was um uh on any reading uh
[10:15] especially over the summertime so we
[10:17] really gutted a lot there and then
[10:18] there's another one where you can see
[10:22] that we came all the way back down again
[10:23] to the 22 levels uh in terms of the fear
[10:27] greed index so crypto was wiped out out
[10:29] on the momentum side and then this is
[10:31] that chart I was saying of the
[10:33] historical highs going into the year of
[10:35] people of the percentage of people
[10:36] expecting 12mon increase in stocks it
[10:39] came down sharply year-over-year S&P is
[10:41] coming down I still think year-over-year
[10:43] S&P is going to head towards single
[10:46] digits if not towards zero during the
[10:48] course of this year uh which means we're
[10:50] going to have a period of time where
[10:51] you're going to have choppiness you're
[10:52] just not going to go up in a straight
[10:53] line uh that being said here's the
[10:57] reality of the situation everyone got
[10:58] that bearish P was down 1.4% for the
[11:01] month so not a big deal uh and it's
[11:04] still up for the year and it's had
[11:06] plenty of up months so you got a down
[11:08] month uh nothing big at the end and if
[11:10] you look at the world index which also
[11:13] includes the US it was down 74 basis
[11:15] points and again look how many up months
[11:16] there's been and then you get this one
[11:18] little down tick in there so the rest of
[11:20] the world was much stronger and this is
[11:22] the year- to-day performance S&P is up
[11:24] 1.2% just look at all these that are up
[11:27] I'd be more worried about the healthare
[11:29] Staples real estate uh utilities being
[11:32] strong I'll get into why I'm not worried
[11:34] about it right now and what you should
[11:36] be watching on that front but you can
[11:38] see these are the names that have been
[11:39] dominating performance you've got the
[11:41] three this is where the mag 7 live this
[11:43] is them in in in Commercial Services
[11:45] infotech and consumer discretionary so
[11:48] it just looks to me like um people were
[11:51] bailing out of things that had worked
[11:52] really well the last two years uh just
[11:54] to highlight that this was not a
[11:56] complete AI Tech unwind uh the board
[11:59] boring names in Tech or the used to be
[12:01] boring names IBM sitting at alltime
[12:03] highs barely budged last week uh Cisco
[12:06] one of the biggest benefactors from the
[12:08] data center buildout cyber no correction
[12:11] whatsoever still sitting up near the
[12:13] highs it's taken all these years to get
[12:15] back up to where it was at the peak in
[12:16] the dotom bubble but that's where that
[12:18] is uh very very uh indicative of people
[12:21] are just not in there and then without
[12:23] anyone talking about it this is the S&P
[12:25] breath um cumulative breath is basically
[12:28] at the all-time high we're slightly off
[12:30] the highs and we literally went up into
[12:34] uh into March we went up at really high
[12:36] levels so you've had a big move higher
[12:38] in this uh in terms of breath just not
[12:40] showing anything msci World X the US the
[12:43] white line here we had based in there
[12:45] for almost all of 24 we bumped higher
[12:48] the S&P looks like it's in a
[12:50] consolidation like I said I think it's
[12:52] possible this could turn into something
[12:53] bigger it would have to be economic
[12:55] related uh but as of right now the rest
[12:58] of the world is doing fine and here's
[13:00] the S&P you've posted backtack 20% years
[13:03] we've had a correction sentiment has
[13:05] collapsed and we're still up 1 and a
[13:07] half% and I've got people telling me
[13:09] it's going to fall 15 uh on the back of
[13:11] Trump's policies so sentiment has just
[13:14] come off very sharply and I think it's
[13:16] important to keep it into context that
[13:18] the market is kind of taking all this
[13:20] news
[13:21] again and it's saying if anything
[13:24] happens to the surprise side in a
[13:26] positive way if the tariffs are delayed
[13:28] another month I think you're going to
[13:29] get another new all-time high and maybe
[13:31] we fail again and we go through this
[13:33] thing the entire year but I think we're
[13:35] starting to get to the point where the
[13:36] momentum stuff is Unwound and I think
[13:38] you can safely look for names that are
[13:40] growing earnings and as long as you have
[13:42] the backdrop of strong earnings and no
[13:45] recession you're still going to have a a
[13:47] year where risk assets are going to be
[13:49] up as people get more negative on the
[13:51] economy in terms of the draw down in the
[13:53] S&P you can barely see it so off the
[13:55] highs we barely fell including the one
[13:57] day it was down uh I just want to
[13:59] highlight the mag 7 with all of that
[14:01] weakness and everything El it was up
[14:03] over 100% in 23 it was up over 60% last
[14:07] year and year to dat it down 65% so for
[14:10] all that uh you've had a barely any
[14:13] correction with Bitcoin it's the same
[14:15] thing the amount of people that have
[14:16] panicked and called up saying what's
[14:17] going on bitcoin was up over 150% this
[14:20] year it was up over 100% last year it's
[14:23] down 9% year to date um I'll go through
[14:26] some charts that just highlight uh the
[14:28] importance of some things related to
[14:30] bitcoin and how it's part of this but
[14:32] just again Nvidia versus the momentum
[14:34] factor I just want to show Nvidia has
[14:37] been momentum it's been the driving
[14:40] Factor because at the end of the day
[14:41] Nvidia is the as long as the capex is
[14:44] coming through the AI advancements are
[14:46] happening the AI agents are happening
[14:48] the profit margin growth is happening so
[14:50] as long as Nvidia can burn off the
[14:53] excesses which in my opinion if you look
[14:56] at the stock I mean we were up at 140
[14:59] back in in June we're still here so
[15:01] we've burned off a lot and so if Nvidia
[15:05] has made a low and I'll go through some
[15:07] things at least to think about on Nvidia
[15:09] that's where it's going to become
[15:10] important if Nvidia breaks down
[15:13] below uh the lows that it made here like
[15:16] 116 and we start to trade lower then I
[15:19] think uh you know you're probably going
[15:21] to have another leg in the momentum
[15:22] stuff but just in terms of the argument
[15:25] for NVIDIA so they went through earnings
[15:27] and this has been this is the price
[15:29] Target by the analysts out there what
[15:31] you see is that Nvidia has had plenty of
[15:33] times where it's fallen off from the
[15:35] price Target and then eventually it just
[15:37] grows itself back into the price Target
[15:39] the price targets have never been agreed
[15:41] just relative to the stock price and
[15:43] it's worked its way higher so now we've
[15:44] got a 175 average price Target right now
[15:48] and we're down at
[15:50] 125 so in terms of like what we've done
[15:54] we've really found a way to burn this
[15:56] whole thing off while the earnings
[15:58] continue to grow and the analyst keep
[15:59] saying we expect more to come uh it's
[16:02] driven the PE down to levels that
[16:04] haven't been seen you know the lowest
[16:07] level outside of kind of pukes in the
[16:09] market uh since 2016 so you're sitting
[16:13] at levels where you have some cushion
[16:16] fundamentally uh for those of you who
[16:18] don't follow and you just figure you
[16:20] know you're reading stuff like it's
[16:22] peaked it's done whatever I this is the
[16:25] data center growth um including the
[16:27] fourth quarter so this this comes in at
[16:29] at 35 billion here's where it was last
[16:32] year at this time at 18 billion so we're
[16:35] still talking at 93% year-over-year and
[16:38] 18% quarter over quarter so you can sit
[16:41] there and say it's overvalued at
[16:43] whatever I just showed 23 times earnings
[16:46] but I mean it's not egregious um in
[16:49] terms of people panicking about the
[16:51] profit margins just look at what
[16:53] happened um they B they took their
[16:56] profit margins up to here and we've had
[16:57] a slight increment downtick as they do a
[17:00] big buildout for Blackwell um primarily
[17:04] due to the production ramp of of
[17:05] Blackwell processors so there's this
[17:07] whole debate on everything and it's just
[17:09] ridiculous to me to just look at it and
[17:11] not at least be like okay we had a 26
[17:14] and a half% correction in it um it was a
[17:17] big fall like it went down a lot so when
[17:19] you go down 27% after deep seek and then
[17:23] you kind of spend some time and you have
[17:25] this big reversal after the negative
[17:27] earnings day we'll see how everything
[17:29] trades but I think you want to pay
[17:30] attention to it I bring this up for
[17:32] everyone who's saying Bitcoin has had a
[17:34] collapse or whatever Nvidia Falls
[17:37] 27% no one seems to really care that
[17:40] much and they
[17:41] go Bitcoin had the exact same percentage
[17:44] fall um so I you know again I I I view
[17:47] Bitcoin as being the dominant asset
[17:49] again this year as the year plays out uh
[17:52] because of the the deregulation that's
[17:54] happening because of the sponsorship
[17:55] there but also because of the adoption
[17:57] uh I'll go through some of that um in
[18:00] terms of the changes uh because Black
[18:02] Rock added it to their model portfolio
[18:05] and I think you're going to see more and
[18:06] more places do this I also think you're
[18:08] going to see higher numbers than what we
[18:09] saw but this is really the big story for
[18:11] you guys um the profit margin and again
[18:14] I'm going to keep harping on this
[18:15] because you want to see if it's
[18:16] spreading out and the Blended net profit
[18:19] margin for the S&P is 12.6% which is
[18:21] above the previous quarters of 12.2
[18:24] above the year ago 11.5 and above the
[18:26] 5-year average 11.6 at sector nine
[18:29] sectors reported year-over-year increase
[18:30] in the profit margins led by financials
[18:33] and this is a critical part in this
[18:34] because this is one of the sectors that
[18:36] I think benefits the most from AI the
[18:38] main point is here you just have very
[18:42] big profit margin stories from AI as the
[18:45] adoption grows um this shows you the
[18:48] sentiment um we had larger Cuts than
[18:52] normal for q1 given the concerns in the
[18:55] market about inflation and tariffs
[18:57] they've lowered their estimates so this
[18:59] is the first place you're seeing again
[19:01] people they don't know how to deal with
[19:02] the tariffs and I get it um if he puts
[19:05] large tariffs in it's going to have an
[19:06] impact in the economy it's going to have
[19:08] it's going to take inflation higher and
[19:10] you're going to see businesses not know
[19:11] what to do they're going to slow stuff
[19:13] down it'll have a slowing of the economy
[19:16] uh when Steve Cohen said he thinks the
[19:18] economy could slow from Two and a Half
[19:20] to one and a half and I heard people say
[19:21] it's a big deal it's not a big deal
[19:24] that's not a recession that means
[19:25] there's no real big job losses and that
[19:28] means rates are going to go down which
[19:29] is what's been happening and it gives
[19:31] the room for the FED to cut except for
[19:33] the fact that we've got the Tariff side
[19:34] so we're kind of in this place where you
[19:36] can see where there's a cap on the
[19:37] market as we go through this attempt to
[19:40] get the budget uh in better order and
[19:43] the fact that he's trying to do it
[19:44] before the midterms next year so I do
[19:46] think it's going to be a choppy year
[19:49] because of that so Americans are
[19:50] expecting higher inflations that can
[19:51] unnerve the FED um again more and more
[19:54] people are talking about the inflation
[19:56] side it showed up in a huge way in the
[19:59] data this is the conference board uh
[20:02] inflation expectations for one year up
[20:05] 80 basis points the biggest monthly
[20:07] increase since back in 22 and after they
[20:10] printed money I mean as I've said I
[20:13] don't know how Donald Trump can do
[20:17] anything to raise inflations without
[20:18] taking a severe hit in the polls um
[20:21] inflation is what has taken down
[20:23] governments around the globe you can do
[20:25] whatever you want in terms of the budget
[20:26] deficit for people who are voting
[20:29] um it's not a high margin and if you
[20:31] mess around with prices at a time when
[20:34] prices are already a little bit uh of a
[20:37] problem it will have approval rating
[20:39] side and I just don't think that that's
[20:41] the way they're going to end up going
[20:43] and then if you move the stock Side
[20:44] Lower then the revenue side comes in so
[20:47] again fiscal dominance in the position
[20:49] the government's in is it's a very
[20:50] difficult predicament I don't
[20:52] structurally think that they can change
[20:53] everything I think the fraud and stuff
[20:55] from Doge and all the things of finding
[20:57] I think that's great cuz that's not
[20:59] really money multiplier government's not
[21:01] a great investment side uh but if they
[21:03] can save a couple hundred million to 500
[21:05] million great I mean we just increased
[21:07] the capex numbers uh for AI over uh
[21:11] about 70 to 80 billion for this year so
[21:14] I'm not really concerned about a
[21:17] recession but I do think the regime of
[21:20] again stagflation I talked about it last
[21:23] week and said that's the regime we're in
[21:24] well you got Muhammad alaran now writing
[21:26] about it everyone's kind of talking
[21:27] about the inflations
[21:29] side and you know Trump had to
[21:32] acknowledge it in a press conference
[21:33] this week and they're trying to boost
[21:36] egg Imports which sounds funny as it is
[21:39] but regardless um he acknowledged the
[21:42] fact that it's a disaster right now on
[21:45] Friday we had a huge drop which got a
[21:47] lot of press in the GDP now uh where
[21:50] first quarter GDP now dropped from Two
[21:53] and change down to one and a half some
[21:55] of that was because of the inflation
[21:57] numbers relative once we we got the
[21:58] spending numbers uh inflation was higher
[22:01] than spending so you had to drop off to
[22:03] some degree uh because of that we'll see
[22:05] how the inflation numbers are the rest
[22:06] of the quarter but the biggest um
[22:09] problem was on the uh the trade import
[22:12] side uh this is the sentiment side for
[22:14] the consumer confidence which dropped
[22:17] significantly uh so you had the largest
[22:19] drop uh since 2021 in a month uh so
[22:23] confidence dropped and then this is the
[22:25] chart I was referencing this is the
[22:27] trade side so this is the the thing that
[22:28] took GDP now the reason this is
[22:31] important is this will snap back um this
[22:33] seems to be a massive front loading uh
[22:36] of imports before uh the tariffs went
[22:40] into place which would make sense so by
[22:42] having this massive drop off you should
[22:44] see a bounce back up here which means
[22:46] we'll get back in a positive territory
[22:48] for that and and then if the inflation
[22:50] headline number uh doesn't continue at
[22:53] the season you know the the worry that
[22:54] we had in January with the seasonal
[22:56] adjustments you'll get a spending boost
[22:58] back up too so I don't we're not we're
[23:00] not talking about a negative GDP uh
[23:03] we're just talking about a situation
[23:04] where it's come down uh in terms of
[23:06] people are watching the claims now uh
[23:09] again applications un employment for
[23:11] federal workers program um so this is
[23:13] going around people are worried about
[23:15] claims I'm not worried about the job
[23:16] situation at all um you're starting that
[23:19] recession us recession no longer seems
[23:21] completely Unthinkable as joob was claim
[23:22] Spike higher so I think the media is
[23:24] trying to talk up uh this uh I think
[23:27] that's going to be going on
[23:29] but the reality is we are seeing
[23:31] weakness in the data now again this is a
[23:33] sentiment thing so this is the City
[23:36] Surprise Index this means that are the
[23:39] data releases beating or missing The
[23:41] Economist forecast so we're missing the
[23:44] white line here is going straight down I
[23:46] think people got over their skis on the
[23:48] Trump policies the peak happened right
[23:50] after he took in everyone was expecting
[23:51] there to be a gross Surge and inflation
[23:53] and what we've had is the data has been
[23:55] missing and it's been going down on a
[23:57] weaker side and this this is with the
[23:58] jobs number being okay so I think this
[24:01] has been important because what it's
[24:02] done is it's taken 10e rates down so 10e
[24:04] rates have followed as they normally do
[24:07] the City Surprise index and so when
[24:09] people were expecting us to head up to
[24:11] 5% and we got above 480 well now we're
[24:14] down to 420 there's a 60 basis point cut
[24:17] and we're back to where we were before
[24:19] he took over so you're going to start to
[24:21] see some improvement on the housing data
[24:23] because it's come down and the other
[24:25] places where rates are and he has a goal
[24:27] to try and get rates down so so I just
[24:29] would watch that because I think we're
[24:30] just in this phase where we had a
[24:31] stronger dollar we had higher rates now
[24:33] we've had a weaker dollar Rel you know
[24:35] from the peak and we've had rates come
[24:37] down so we'll see what goes on with the
[24:38] tariffs but I think we're just kind of J
[24:40] jostling around while earnings growth in
[24:42] AI are structural and that's the key
[24:44] thing to do and here's the other
[24:45] structural side rates have come down
[24:49] economic fears have gone up stocks were
[24:51] in a correction and credit spreads have
[24:54] not budged if there's any weakness in
[24:56] the economy trust me credit spread
[24:57] sitting at all times ties will show it
[24:59] the leverage loan Market has not moved
[25:02] at all it continues to print this is
[25:04] total return for the leverage loan uh
[25:06] ETF and it has not budged we have
[25:09] absolutely nothing going on this is a
[25:12] quarter these are quarterly um numbers
[25:15] everything is good guys there's nothing
[25:17] going on inside the credit markets at
[25:19] all and Banks aren't either if there's a
[25:21] problem in the economy banks are not
[25:23] going to be outperforming the S&P and
[25:25] we've been in an uptrend in this this
[25:27] spiked um and has been spiked after
[25:30] trump it came down and then it's gone
[25:32] right back up on a relative basis you're
[25:34] going to see weakness in banks at some
[25:36] point and this is one of the things and
[25:38] this is the reason why the S&P matters
[25:40] if the S&P is not going down last year
[25:43] household net worth went up by over1
[25:46] trillion I've said this before when we
[25:48] talk about saving 300 billion or 400
[25:51] billion and then people come out and say
[25:52] that's going to take the economy into a
[25:54] recession it's about spending and it's
[25:56] about capex cap X is there it's going to
[25:59] happen these companies are not affected
[26:01] by the tariffs and they're Racing for AI
[26:03] and then the other part that matters is
[26:05] the top 50% of Spenders and if you want
[26:07] to expend it higher this is the share of
[26:09] spending by the income groups so if you
[26:11] fire people that are in the lower income
[26:14] side they just don't drive the economy
[26:16] anymore this number has been moving this
[26:18] way for a while but when you take the
[26:20] top uh the top 10 and then you go to the
[26:23] next 10 uh 10 I mean you're dealing with
[26:27] 20% of the economy is driven or 60% of
[26:31] the of spending is driven by 20% of the
[26:33] people so there's just a math side to
[26:35] this so people that call for recessions
[26:37] or call for
[26:38] anything they're just making stuff up
[26:40] they're not they're really just using
[26:42] history and saying well this is going to
[26:44] collapse us if stocks fall then those
[26:47] groups will stop spending the way they
[26:49] have because stocks are what's driving
[26:50] household net worth so you want to see
[26:53] stocks go down as long as breath is fine
[26:56] and as long as the only names that are
[26:58] going going down on the top end and they
[26:59] stabilize and sentiment goes down then
[27:01] everything is fine so we'll keep
[27:03] watching it but you're going to need to
[27:04] see spreads widen out you're going to
[27:05] need to see the bank start to
[27:06] underperform and you're going to need to
[27:08] see the stock market go down for there
[27:11] be any fears and if these Falls happen
[27:14] in a sideways Market where half the
[27:16] stocks are going up or more stocks are
[27:18] going up than going down that's
[27:19] indicative of no recession not
[27:21] indicative of a recession so I'm just
[27:23] going to keep saying it and again the
[27:25] top 10% own 87% of stock
[27:29] uh so that's what drives the economy at
[27:30] this point is the stock market and right
[27:32] now it's fine um just CEOs sing uh
[27:36] signal the highest confident and you
[27:38] can't see it here at this point but uh
[27:40] it's two years uh so again CEOs are
[27:44] confident that's where we are um it was
[27:47] a big week for AI because we've done so
[27:49] much in the market side I'm not going to
[27:50] go through everything uh open AI is 4.5
[27:53] I'm trying to think if there's anything
[27:54] in here that's worth going the Amazon AI
[27:56] assistant Alexa and then Claude put out
[27:58] their their next one nothing big that
[28:01] you guys need to worry about um but I
[28:03] thought this was really interesting and
[28:05] this is something that to me is about uh
[28:08] why the mag 7 to me are going to have
[28:10] trouble not with earnings they're not
[28:12] going to collapse but I think their
[28:14] growth rate will be slowing every year I
[28:16] think they've seen the peak of their
[28:17] benefits from AI that's just my own
[28:20] opinion uh I don't see how they're going
[28:22] to get the return on investment at a
[28:25] level it's not bearish uh it's just
[28:27] they're multiple are probably going to
[28:29] compress like nvidia's did where if they
[28:31] don't meet good numbers as a group it's
[28:34] just going to be hard and I think
[28:35] they're going to be hard to move so I
[28:37] think we're going to be in multiple
[28:38] compression for those names while we see
[28:41] the increase in things like IBM and
[28:43] Cisco which are trading at half the PE
[28:46] so um a Cisco is still trading I think
[28:48] at around 16 PE they should be a market
[28:51] multiple they're they're benefiting from
[28:53] AI in multiple ways IBM the same thing
[28:55] they should be Market multiple stocks
[28:57] they shouldn't be Trading below uh where
[28:59] the mag 7 are at this point and I think
[29:01] that's what you're going through the
[29:02] reason this is important is stripe is
[29:05] showing the time it takes for
[29:09] startups to get to revenue Milestones
[29:12] annualized Revenue Milestone it's
[29:14] happening at much faster Pace than in
[29:18] 2018 and I don't think these companies
[29:20] because of competition are going to be
[29:21] able to IPO at big numbers I think this
[29:24] is going to be a massive growth in the
[29:26] entrepreneurial side with which will
[29:28] take away from the public markets I just
[29:30] don't think these companies are going to
[29:33] are going to be able to go public that's
[29:34] again I think from what I've heard out
[29:36] of Silicon Valley uh and the phrase that
[29:39] I've heard instead of there being three
[29:41] 100 billion companies there's going to
[29:43] be three hundred billion dollar or sub
[29:46] billion doll companies and if that's the
[29:48] case those companies may never go public
[29:51] and if they don't have a monetizing
[29:53] event uh and they don't need a lot of
[29:54] equity uh to grow then you're going to
[29:57] have a change who's driving the economy
[29:59] and I think entrepreneurs that are
[30:00] getting laid off by meta and other
[30:02] places are going to do that uh Bitcoin
[30:05] just quickly here to highlight why I
[30:07] think that was it so we had a month it
[30:09] was down 18% for the month by the time
[30:11] it closed um again massive months the
[30:15] prior year should be no surprise that
[30:18] we're getting a correction in Bitcoin I
[30:20] thought we were trading well enough up
[30:22] there and it wouldn't take much to break
[30:23] out but once we got another leg lower in
[30:25] momentum uh not a surprise that it just
[30:28] it couldn't hang in there and then once
[30:30] it broke down uh one thing people that
[30:32] trade Bitcoin are going to have to get
[30:33] used to it's going to be used as a hedge
[30:36] against Tech it's going to be used in
[30:38] the um the trafi markets I would say
[30:40] more as a a a beta hedge whether it's to
[30:43] the upside or downside and the short
[30:45] base has grown in Bitcoin I've heard
[30:47] multiple different macro funds uh say
[30:49] that they thought it was going back down
[30:51] to the Trump uh breakout area we got
[30:54] pretty close to it and then on Friday we
[30:56] ripped higher uh after Black Rock
[30:58] announcement so the draw down normal
[31:01] draw down for them I mean 20% aside from
[31:04] the 1819 and the 22 period I don't think
[31:07] this exists anymore this was not only
[31:10] FTX uh which obviously can happen at any
[31:13] point with with uh a growing technology
[31:16] but I think we're in a world where the
[31:17] vs come down and these types of
[31:19] Corrections are going to be the norm
[31:20] going forward it trades at about still
[31:24] about a 50 to 100% Vol premium to the
[31:28] mag 7 so if the mag 7 has 20%
[31:30] Corrections you'd expect this to have 30
[31:33] to 40 the fact that we had a 15%
[31:36] correction this is about exactly where
[31:38] in my mind it should have been uh so I
[31:40] think Bitcoin did exactly what it should
[31:41] and again just to highlight you know
[31:43] 100% 150 and then down 10 this is not a
[31:46] big deal uh for Bitcoin in terms of the
[31:49] charts and just some reasons why I think
[31:51] the lows are in so this is my side on it
[31:54] this is the oneyear uh average so it's
[31:57] kind of like a 2 52 day but this has
[31:59] worked really well over history uh
[32:02] also this was the peak before we broke
[32:05] out uh before uh the election so I kind
[32:09] of used this intraday we got down to 77
[32:12] looks to me with that kind of
[32:15] reversal that might be it um will kind
[32:17] of play out but the other thing was just
[32:20] using some candlesticks and again I I
[32:22] spend a lot of time watching this stuff
[32:24] trade uh because I think it's important
[32:27] and I think it's an asset that will
[32:28] continue to be a growing trading asset
[32:30] you got some nice RSI divergences at the
[32:33] lowest level uh going back to here and
[32:35] if you look at these prior ones where we
[32:37] had divergences where price made lower
[32:40] price made lower you get divergences in
[32:42] in the RSI uh this is a 4H hour RSI uh
[32:47] it looks to me like uh We've held in
[32:49] there and then to finish up uh if you
[32:51] didn't see it there's going to be a
[32:53] crypto Summit the only reason I bring
[32:54] this up is you have to remember that the
[32:57] admin Administration absolutely needs
[33:00] crypto they were huge in deciding the
[33:03] election a massive part uh I don't think
[33:06] he can allow to not be positive on this
[33:08] and continue to move things forward so
[33:11] uh that's it for this week uh it was a
[33:14] busy couple weeks but I think we've kind
[33:15] of found some stabilization uh we'll see
[33:18] how the tariffs go this week and how the
[33:19] market responds to it but watch Nvidia
[33:21] and see how it trades here in this uh 15
[33:24] to 125 area and see if it can build the
[33:26] bottom that's it
