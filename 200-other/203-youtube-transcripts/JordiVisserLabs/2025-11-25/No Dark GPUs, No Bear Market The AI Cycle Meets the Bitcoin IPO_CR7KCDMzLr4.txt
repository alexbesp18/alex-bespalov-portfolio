[00:00] Uh first of all, thank you and welcome
[00:03] to everyone who's uh who's joining for
[00:05] the first week. Busy week with uh my
[00:08] Substack on the Bitcoin IPO. So uh for
[00:11] those of you joining for the first time,
[00:13] first of all, subscribe if you haven't.
[00:15] Secondly, uh the goal of this since the
[00:18] day I started it was really to go
[00:19] through the traditional macro world,
[00:21] economics, the stock market, connect it
[00:24] back to what's happening on artificial
[00:26] intelligence, which is acting as an
[00:28] accelerant to lead us into the digital
[00:30] economy, and finishing
[00:33] with how that's all related to what's
[00:35] going on with crypto today, but also
[00:36] comparing kind of the movements that
[00:38] have happened with inside crypto with
[00:40] the traditional finance world. uh
[00:43] because there is a change in assets that
[00:45] are going from the fiat assets which are
[00:47] still half a quadrillion uh into the
[00:50] crypto world and that that move is in
[00:52] the very early innings today. We'll go
[00:54] through at the end a lot of what I wrote
[00:56] about and just some of the charts to
[00:58] help people understand why uh I wrote
[01:01] it. So first we'll go through the rec
[01:03] recap um instead of an AI bubble week
[01:06] the focus is going to be on breath the
[01:08] retail blood bath. Um it did look like a
[01:10] bottom to me on Friday. I'll go through
[01:12] the reasons why, but more importantly,
[01:15] uh, whenever you're in kind of a
[01:16] correction with inside a bull market,
[01:18] you're looking for what the structural
[01:20] bull market story is, and I'm going to
[01:22] cover that and why the banks are
[01:23] something to watch. Why despite the
[01:25] breath problems, equal weight is still a
[01:27] positive story, not a negative. The Fed
[01:30] is getting closer to needing to change
[01:32] things up. They've already announced QT
[01:34] changes. Uh but there's more that has to
[01:36] come because the liquidity problems are
[01:38] evident uh because they're raising lots
[01:41] of money right now in T- bills. Uh and
[01:43] that liquidity problem that uh you know
[01:45] people have talked about it's happening.
[01:47] Um job fears continue to rise obviously
[01:51] in New York City behind me. Socialism is
[01:54] rising. I'm going to put that in the
[01:55] context of how people should be thinking
[01:57] about it because it's not the end of it.
[01:58] The weaken AI and then really spend time
[02:01] on on Bitcoin. So S&P despite all the
[02:04] panic and all the you know fears that
[02:06] were going on by the time the week ended
[02:08] the S&P was only down 1.6%. Again look
[02:11] at how many up moves we've had since the
[02:14] liberation day lows and every 3 or 4
[02:17] weeks we end up having a down week. So
[02:19] next last week should not have been
[02:21] anything different. Q's down a little
[02:23] bit more. It was actually the worst week
[02:25] for the Q's since liberation day. But
[02:28] again, the rally in all of the AI
[02:30] related names had been massive. Uh IWM
[02:34] continues to hang in there despite a bad
[02:36] week for tech. It actually outperformed
[02:39] only down 1.9% by the end of the week.
[02:42] And what I want to highlight here is you
[02:44] can see this nice hammer formation in
[02:46] terms of the S&P breaking below the
[02:48] 50-day. It was the first time we had
[02:49] been below the 50-day since April um or
[02:53] May 1st and we actually closed back
[02:56] above it. Uh the white line here, we
[02:58] closed almost unchanged. That is when
[02:59] the shutdown started. We've had no data.
[03:02] We've gone down, we've gone up, we've
[03:04] gone down. I would say this is exactly
[03:05] what you should have expected when
[03:07] there's no economic data and everyone's
[03:08] freaking out. Uh we had two strong
[03:11] non-seasonal months in September and
[03:13] October. November has been a slight
[03:14] negative so far. Would not be surprising
[03:17] if all the seasonals continue
[03:19] continually remain um messed up in terms
[03:21] of the sectors over the week. So we
[03:24] finished down 1.63% 63% but there were
[03:26] more sectors up and down. Another sign
[03:28] of a of a bull market not a bare market
[03:30] means it was rotation and it's very
[03:32] interesting to me that energy was on the
[03:34] positive side. I'm going to highlight
[03:35] also that despite industrials being down
[03:38] it's a very good week for transports.
[03:39] When transports and energy are going up
[03:41] that's usually a leading indicator for
[03:42] PMIs. I'll get into that. Get the market
[03:45] a mint because it has bad breath. So,
[03:47] bad breath week, which means there were
[03:49] a lot of stocks going down and a lot of
[03:53] stocks that were down big. But most
[03:55] importantly, you started getting these.
[03:57] Um,
[03:59] I've uh for for people that used to work
[04:01] for me, I used to highlight the
[04:02] Hindenburgs all the time in terms of the
[04:05] Omens. It actually was a good sign
[04:06] historically, especially back here in
[04:08] 2020, but again, that was the COVID
[04:10] shutdown. Uh but it these signals are
[04:13] generally when they're in clusters like
[04:15] decent. A lot of them happened in '07 uh
[04:18] around the time of the peak. The only
[04:19] problem is now
[04:22] there's 2,000 names in the Russell 2000
[04:25] that have a combined market cap of $3
[04:27] trillion. Nvidia is now 5 trillion. It's
[04:30] not the same as it was back then. We've
[04:32] had so much concentration that the
[04:34] market is dominated by the MAG 7. So,
[04:36] the breath indicators are not as useful
[04:38] as they used to be in terms of whether
[04:40] we finally have had a decent correction.
[04:42] Uh, this is the percentage of names
[04:45] above and or I'm sorry, above the 50-day
[04:47] moving average for the Russell, the S&P,
[04:48] and the NASDAQ composite. They're all
[04:50] below 40%. We've done enough of a
[04:52] correction at this point that we are
[04:54] oversold. Um, spec names, uh, I created
[04:57] this index. I show it occasionally.
[04:59] These are the kind of putlo in here, put
[05:03] the quantum names in here. These are the
[05:04] names that show up on Twitter or on X
[05:07] that retail loves to trade. They have a
[05:10] higher beta. They don't make money at
[05:12] this point. They're definitely more
[05:13] speculative in my mind. And when they
[05:15] show signs of weakness, generally the
[05:17] market starts to follow and they lead.
[05:19] So you had a leading indicator here in
[05:21] July before we had a sell off. You had a
[05:23] leading indicator here where they sold
[05:24] off, the S&P went back up and basically
[05:27] now the S&P was pulled down. So you look
[05:28] for a point where these are oversold.
[05:30] This is the retail channel. This is a
[05:32] big part of what's driving the market.
[05:35] So when they're losing money and they're
[05:36] bailing out of things for the time
[05:37] being, you get that. So here are,
[05:39] believe it or not, these are the two
[05:40] weeks. So this is from October 15th to
[05:43] November 6. Down 28% in that spec name
[05:45] bet. Look how many of these names um I
[05:47] created. It's 29 again. I got all of
[05:49] these from X. You can see all of them.
[05:53] It's an equal weight creation, but a lot
[05:54] of the names are down 30 40%. You've had
[05:57] a big correction. And so everyone that
[05:58] was complaining about a bubble and I
[06:00] highlighted that a lot of the energy AI
[06:02] names were definitely bubble names. You
[06:04] got that. Um this is not systemic. This
[06:06] is not something to care. They gave up
[06:08] basically all the games from the
[06:09] summertime. Uh this is the S&P overlaid
[06:13] with the Renaissance IPO ETF. And this
[06:16] is back to 2023. This becomes important
[06:18] because this is actually a very good
[06:20] sign. These IPOs are somewhat similar to
[06:23] the spec names in the fact that they're
[06:24] retail. But then when you do a ven
[06:26] diagram, the other part that they are is
[06:28] these are IPOs. These are real
[06:30] businesses. These have had uh good
[06:32] stories attached to them. So they peaked
[06:34] the same time that the spec names did,
[06:36] which was back in September and they've
[06:38] sold off. This says retail was again in
[06:41] a position where they're getting stopped
[06:42] out. They're taking profits. They're
[06:44] doing whatever. So this ETF, which has
[06:46] things like Circle and Fermy and things
[06:48] like that that have been in there, they
[06:50] eventually pulled the market down. Now
[06:52] this year if you go back and look at the
[06:55] times that the RSI and this is the fivew
[06:58] week RSI. So just to show that this is
[07:01] more extensive each time it's hit this
[07:04] area here which is right around 28.
[07:07] Uh these are the lines in the sand for
[07:09] the S&P. The bottom the bottom the
[07:12] bottom the bottom. And then up here this
[07:15] was not the bottom but this was before
[07:17] liberation day. And I'm going to treat
[07:18] this as a slightly different thing.
[07:20] Bitcoin had peaked in here in December
[07:22] uh or the altcoins did and started to
[07:24] break down which I'm going to highlight
[07:25] why for people that are more focused on
[07:27] crypto. Why you want to look at the
[07:29] trady markets and which part of them are
[07:31] the closest in terms of the bridge of
[07:33] watching performance. The fact that this
[07:35] is oversold and this has been a buy sign
[07:37] for the S&P has very good implications
[07:39] for Bitcoin when looking for signals
[07:42] like that. At the same time, you got
[07:44] similar story in the VIX. So in this
[07:46] case, the VIX hit basically 22 intraday,
[07:50] sold off on Friday. Again, another looks
[07:53] like a a position that that'll hold. But
[07:55] if you go back and look at each of the
[07:56] times that we hit 22, and what I'm
[07:58] looking at is this day, this day, this
[08:02] day, this day, not the actual peak, but
[08:04] just to show how good of a signal this
[08:06] has been. Again, day before the bottom,
[08:11] little bottom of this correction, but
[08:12] again, the riskreward had shifted. you
[08:14] kind of tested the actual low, the
[08:17] actual low. So, when you can buy the VIX
[08:19] and the IPO, we have a lot of bottom
[08:20] signals aside from the short-term
[08:23] signals. So, the candlestick formation,
[08:24] the IPO, the spec, all of that stuff.
[08:27] John Broke for 22V for those of you who
[08:30] don't know, I do a lot of work for 22V.
[08:33] I will be posting a lot of uh idea based
[08:36] stuff on the website. We're going to
[08:38] have a uh a payw wall setup. So for
[08:40] people that are trading looking for
[08:42] ideas with inside AI that maybe are a
[08:44] little less purely momentum driven and
[08:46] actually have a fundamental story behind
[08:47] them and fit I'll be doing a lot of that
[08:49] work uh going forward. It's not on the
[08:52] site yet. You can go to 22V but John Ro
[08:54] is fantastic. He and I did a
[08:56] presentation at Robin Hood uh a panel
[08:58] discussion. We're going to be doing a
[08:59] lot more on this going forward. But what
[09:01] John says, we've known each other since
[09:03] the 90s. uh when banks and financials
[09:06] are strong, markets almost cannot go
[09:08] down. And the reason this is the case is
[09:10] if you're worried about credit, banks
[09:13] usually lead the way down the same way
[09:15] that small caps usually lead. Equal
[09:17] weight usually leads the last thing to
[09:19] go, the koose of a let's say the
[09:21] beginning of a bare market. It's the
[09:22] safest names. You get the junk to go
[09:24] down first. That obviously is what we
[09:26] saw with spec names and with IPO.
[09:29] Theoretically, a little more leverage, a
[09:31] little more retail. But when the banks
[09:32] are strong, markets almost never can go
[09:34] down. And here we are. Seven of seven of
[09:36] these big banks have good strong
[09:38] technical scores. John's work is
[09:40] fantastic in this from a long-term
[09:42] perspective. Um here's a photo of it.
[09:44] This is the S&P uh 500 bank stocks. This
[09:48] is the uh level three gicks for the
[09:50] banks. We made highs in late September,
[09:53] all-time highs. So when you make
[09:55] all-time highs in banks this close, we
[09:56] got a long way. If this was a top in
[09:58] stocks, it'll be a topping process. And
[10:01] that's the point is the banks will start
[10:02] to lead, small caps will start to lead,
[10:04] junk will start to lead, credit spreads
[10:05] will start to widen. We don't have that
[10:07] with banks right now. We actually went
[10:09] up last week in in these stocks and
[10:11] banks despite the weakness in stocks and
[10:13] we're back near the all-time highs. That
[10:14] is a structural sign that credit is fine
[10:17] and that the system is good. European
[10:19] banks, a much weaker area in the market
[10:21] has been Europe lately. They peaked back
[10:23] here in March, but the bank stocks
[10:24] continue to go. European banks made new
[10:27] 52- week highs this week. Um, equal
[10:31] weight made highs
[10:34] last week. Again, you hear about breath,
[10:37] equal weight S&P, which has
[10:39] underperformed the S&P and they show
[10:41] that chart going straight down, which is
[10:42] true. This is part of the AI demolition,
[10:44] which will continue. But a bull market
[10:46] is when equal weight is still going up.
[10:48] And we made all-time highs in equal
[10:50] weight last week. Still too early.
[10:51] There'd have to be a topping formation.
[10:53] Russell, same thing. High all-time highs
[10:55] last week. This is just a correction off
[10:58] of an extended move. Uh this was a good
[11:01] chart. This is from the compound uh
[11:04] podcast I listen to occasionally. They
[11:05] do a good job, especially with the
[11:07] slides. Um and this just shows that the
[11:09] S&P is currently 13% 13% above its 200
[11:13] day moving average. John Rog does a lot
[11:14] of this stuff as well. Whenever you get
[11:16] up to this point, you should expect some
[11:17] mean reversion within a bull market and
[11:19] I think that's what we got. Most
[11:21] importantly, the thing that drives
[11:23] stocks at the end of the day as a
[11:24] leading indicator is going to be the
[11:26] estimate revisions. These lines here,
[11:28] red line here, the white line is the
[11:30] estimate revisions. They are going down
[11:32] when the S&P is going down. This is the
[11:34] 20week moving average. So if I move this
[11:37] backwards, it is a leading indicator.
[11:39] But the most important thing is this
[11:41] zero line. If estimate revisions are
[11:43] fine, these are corrections with inside
[11:45] a bull market. You actually need stuff
[11:47] to go lower or below zero in my opinion
[11:49] for that. Go. We still have very
[11:51] positive over the last 20 weeks and the
[11:53] current numbers are still up here.
[11:55] Estimate revisions which means earnings
[11:58] the forward-looking part of of earnings
[12:00] is still good. And here we go. The
[12:01] earning season over 91% of the companies
[12:03] have now reported 82% have reported
[12:06] actual EPS above estimates which is
[12:08] above the 5-year average. The earning
[12:10] season has been great. It's not just the
[12:12] earnings in terms of revenue. 77% of us
[12:14] of companies have reported actual
[12:16] revenues above consensus uh which is
[12:18] above the 5-year average. So things have
[12:21] been strong. Mike Wilson put that out
[12:22] for the S&P 500 revenues are up 2.3% in
[12:25] Q3 2.3%.
[12:27] Revenues are generally if they're right
[12:30] now at this point of the cycle with um
[12:32] with nominal GDP. If they're greater
[12:34] than nominal GDP then the S&P 500 is
[12:37] doing fine. They were 2.3% in Q3. Right
[12:40] now nominal GDP is about 1.5% a quarter.
[12:43] So again an annualized increase four
[12:47] quarters 3.2% 2% revenues are just rock
[12:50] solid right now. Um we think this is
[12:51] underappreciated story and see this
[12:53] trend continuing in 2026 driving a
[12:55] broadening in earnings contribution
[12:57] across major and secondary indices. I
[12:59] agree with Mike and I think a lot of
[13:00] this is going to come from the PMIs. Uh
[13:02] I will keep saying it on this video
[13:04] every single week. PMIs are going
[13:05] higher. Call me in six n months if I'm
[13:08] wrong. Uh until then I think you're
[13:10] making a mistake if you're not focusing
[13:11] on the broadening out of the market.
[13:13] Elevated profit margins are also
[13:15] helping. Here's the AI story which I
[13:17] spent a lot of time with this week
[13:19] writing papers on for 22V. I'll show
[13:21] I'll show some of that. Um you've got
[13:23] revenues outperforming and then at the
[13:25] same line you've got bottom line that is
[13:27] outperforming due to profit margins.
[13:29] That is a very very strong side and when
[13:31] you're looking at profit margins it is
[13:33] not just the tech names. So the blue uh
[13:36] side here is this quarter. The S&P right
[13:40] now 13.1%
[13:42] profit margin.
[13:44] last year 12.5% at this time. Profit
[13:48] margins are increasing and remember the
[13:50] fear of this year was that the tariffs
[13:53] would bring inflation higher which would
[13:55] hurt consumption and hurt the ability of
[13:57] of companies profit margins. AI is
[13:59] offsetting that in terms of profit
[14:01] margins and just seeing so you guys
[14:02] don't have to deal with this chart which
[14:04] again I showed last week and said
[14:05] everyone's going to talk about it. The
[14:07] forward PE ratio getting near all-time
[14:09] highs or towards the bubble tops.
[14:13] The difference now is the profit
[14:15] margins. So this is a profit adjusted
[14:17] forward PE which is in my opinion also
[14:21] not uh enough because profit margins
[14:24] continue to move higher. So when you go
[14:26] through this and you look at forward
[14:28] profit margins making new all-time highs
[14:30] what I just showed you back then AI is
[14:33] just happening. AI agents are coming.
[14:35] We've seen the labor side. This is going
[14:37] to be increasing profit margins which
[14:39] means the PE ratio should be higher. uh
[14:43] once profit margins start to go down
[14:45] this will come down very very sharply if
[14:47] they move together that's what I think
[14:49] is going to be the case eventually but
[14:50] for the time being the adjusted PE is
[14:52] here it becomes a greater and greater
[14:54] risk as profit margins move up if they
[14:57] fail QE for the mind so what I did is
[15:00] basically just make sure that people
[15:01] understand how big the artificial
[15:04] intelligence side is for liquidity with
[15:06] inside the stock market you are fighting
[15:09] a massive battle when profit margins are
[15:11] going higher and when artificial
[15:13] intelligence is the tailwind, the
[15:15] problem you're running into is the
[15:16] operating leverage that comes on top of
[15:18] it. So QE was something that people
[15:20] fought throughout 2010 to 2019. They
[15:24] were fighting it because they believed
[15:25] that the government would eventually
[15:27] fail in this. What was happening is by
[15:29] moving rates to zero, the stock market
[15:31] was incredibly cheap relative to bonds.
[15:34] So any of you that have heard, you know,
[15:36] heard about debasement lately, ultimate
[15:38] debasement move rates to zero and then
[15:40] you're forcing money into asset classes
[15:42] that are actually producing returns and
[15:44] stocks were getting that. So you also
[15:45] had companies that could issue debt at
[15:47] close to zero and then go buy back their
[15:50] stock which was yielding a significant
[15:52] amount in earnings yield plus the
[15:54] dividend yield. So by retiring the stock
[15:56] by buying it back, you were getting an
[15:58] increase in earnings per share. There's
[16:00] a bigger increase in earnings per share
[16:01] with artificial intelligence because of
[16:03] the operating leverage. If you want to
[16:04] see the report, reach out to 22V, but
[16:07] that is tremendous liquidity. Here is
[16:09] nominal GDP. So, continuing with the
[16:11] structural side and why you shouldn't be
[16:13] worried when we've had corrections like
[16:16] this, this is the S&P in terms of
[16:17] earnings.
[16:19] When you have corrections, they are
[16:21] going to happen from nominal GDP coming
[16:24] down or it's going to end up being a
[16:25] buy. Now, in this case here, we didn't
[16:27] have nominal GDP coming down. This was
[16:30] from the Fed raising heights
[16:32] aggressively. We have the Fed cutting
[16:33] rates. We have nominal GDP still going
[16:35] higher and we have profit margins going
[16:37] higher. This is not a time to be
[16:39] bearish.
[16:40] And this is another reason when you're
[16:42] looking for whether nominal GDP is going
[16:43] to be up. You can fight whether this
[16:45] will eventually be a problem. It's not
[16:47] going to be a problem next year. When
[16:48] they cancel capex, you can go with it,
[16:51] but that's not happening right now. So,
[16:52] these numbers are massive. This is why
[16:54] the PMIs are going to go higher as
[16:55] people start to realize that the data
[16:57] construction on this stuff really just
[16:59] started this year and honestly didn't
[17:01] start until after the one big beautiful
[17:03] bill which allowed people to deal with
[17:05] the depreciation and the uh uh of
[17:09] frontloading a lot of this stuff and
[17:11] still having free cash flow. But
[17:12] remember too we had a tariff situation
[17:14] which de delayed purchases of things.
[17:17] Now we're starting to get into it. The
[17:19] buildout is happening now. Now the PMIs
[17:21] have been delayed and I think now that
[17:22] China and US have basically put a truce
[17:25] on for a year which I'll go through. We
[17:27] did that in terms of the bubble side.
[17:29] Oracle probably the best example. Gaps
[17:31] higher on massive numbers and now it's
[17:34] come back. Nothing has changed. They
[17:35] were issuing debt. They're building
[17:36] things out. Oracle's getting cheaper. It
[17:40] was expensive. You've had and you've had
[17:42] the pullback that was necessary. In
[17:43] terms of the economy, we're not getting
[17:45] economic data. the Johnson red book
[17:47] which is a weekly data point that comes
[17:49] out on retail sales. So we may not be
[17:50] getting anything from the government but
[17:52] the white line here is year-over-year
[17:54] red Johnson red book basically a
[17:56] straight line and overlaid with this is
[17:59] PCE year-over-year which is basically
[18:01] consumption continuing one of them's 5.7
[18:04] the other one's 5.55 this is the way to
[18:06] look at what's happening in the economy
[18:08] nothing has changed the economy is still
[18:10] growing what is coming down are
[18:11] inflation expectations violently too
[18:14] spec names peaked here this has come
[18:16] down this was all around the time of two
[18:19] things one is the Fed Fed cut rates.
[18:20] Number two, the whole situation with the
[18:23] private credit side started to blow up
[18:25] here in this point. You've seen
[18:26] inflation expectations come down and I
[18:29] think this is going to continue and I
[18:31] think this is the surprise going
[18:32] forward. We have gas at the pump at
[18:34] three bucks. Until gas at the pump moves
[18:35] higher, I expect inflation expectations
[18:37] to move down now that we're past the
[18:39] worst
[18:41] of the tariffs.
[18:45] Junk spreads sitting near all-time lows.
[18:47] Again, these are all structural reasons
[18:49] why nothing has changed except for the
[18:52] post index by perma bears. What has
[18:55] changed and what's important is the
[18:57] pressure that's happening with inside
[18:59] [sighs]
[19:00] the liquidity side of the market. So
[19:02] since September and this is a normal
[19:04] process around quarter end, but what
[19:06] we've seen is this is a chart that
[19:08] highlights the reserve balances. So
[19:10] you're getting into the uh less
[19:11] reserves, you're getting into the sofur
[19:14] rate uh the spread everything. And the
[19:17] way I'll make this simplified for people
[19:19] who don't go through, there's more
[19:20] strain with inside the funding markets.
[19:22] This has been there now. This is why the
[19:24] Fed is stopping QT reserves nearing no
[19:28] longer ample. This is the reason the
[19:31] gross issuance of treasury. So I want to
[19:33] make sure you see this. we get this
[19:35] massive move higher in 2020 for COVID
[19:39] with all the money we've spent that
[19:40] brings the deficit higher brings debt to
[19:42] GDP higher. Well, we have massive
[19:45] rollovers happening in treasuries. So,
[19:46] those of you who've listened to Michael
[19:48] How uh who at the time was very bearish
[19:50] around this time of year at the
[19:52] beginning of the year because this would
[19:54] be a big rollover point for treasuries.
[19:55] Well, this is the pressure that's
[19:57] happening. Uh that is what's happening
[19:59] right now is we've got a lot of issuance
[20:02] that are going over Joseph Wang who's
[20:03] phenomenal. If you don't follow him, as
[20:05] someone who's studied the Fed for years,
[20:08] um Fed will need to expand its balance
[20:09] sheet by several hundred billion a year,
[20:11] may start in December to head off
[20:12] year-end funding pressures. A
[20:14] structurally rising TGA and insatiable
[20:16] demand for repo financing leave them
[20:18] little choice. So, I'm not going to go
[20:20] through the TGA and how it's raised up
[20:22] to a trillion, but let's just say
[20:23] there's a bunch of factors that are
[20:25] going to keep things at the higher
[20:26] level. They'll go down, they'll go up.
[20:28] But for the main point, as Fed John
[20:31] Williams says, central bank may soon
[20:33] need to grow its balance sheet. I'm not
[20:35] calling it QE, but this gets important
[20:37] because a lot of what drives markets is
[20:40] a combination of sentiment, but also the
[20:42] liquidity of the market and liquidity is
[20:44] bad. The jobs picture, this was a big
[20:46] announcement this week. Um, basically
[20:50] the most amount of layoffs in the
[20:51] challenger uh
[20:54] for October. So these are the October
[20:56] numbers back to 2003.
[21:03] This is not just some, you know, random
[21:06] occurrence. I still see people saying
[21:07] the Fed should be raising rates. The
[21:09] labor market is weak and anyone who
[21:10] doubts it to me is just just not being
[21:14] honest. Um remember it was the SAM rule
[21:16] last year when we saw the unemployment
[21:18] rate go up to here. It's continued to
[21:20] move higher. This is with inside the
[21:23] University of Michigan. This is the
[21:24] probability of losing a job during the
[21:26] next 12 months. Historically, when this
[21:29] is up here, you've got the unemployment
[21:31] rate moving higher. You've had all these
[21:34] stories this week about the labor market
[21:36] being weak, about more layoffs. It's
[21:39] continuous and it's starting to grow.
[21:41] The more that it gets published, the
[21:43] more that people worry about it. But
[21:44] this is a growing part of the economy
[21:46] and something that to me is structural.
[21:48] I do not believe people are going to be
[21:50] losing jobs. I just believe hiring will
[21:52] remain very weak and the unemployment
[21:53] rate will continue to have a natural
[21:56] drift higher. And if the labor
[21:57] participation rate ever starts to tick
[22:00] back up again, you're going to start to
[22:01] see the unemployment rate go higher
[22:03] because that's what's actually kept it
[22:04] down by about half a percent right now.
[22:08] This is the stock market saying that
[22:10] things are getting worse. So this is the
[22:12] human resources uh GIX level three
[22:15] relative to the S&P. It has collapsed
[22:18] very recently.
[22:19] um this is the PMI over it. So we've got
[22:22] kind of the jobs market coming down. And
[22:25] when you're thinking of this, this is
[22:26] like um ADP, paycheck, stuff like that,
[22:30] different companies that make it up.
[22:32] Now, Pal has talked about the K-shaped
[22:34] economy. And in the most recent uh Fed
[22:39] statement, which I didn't get to go
[22:41] through last week because I had too many
[22:42] slides, he stated that many many public
[22:44] companies are saying there's a
[22:45] bifurcated economy. customers at the
[22:47] lower end are struggling and buying less
[22:49] and shifting to lower cost products, but
[22:51] at the top people are spending. He's
[22:53] talking about the Kshape.
[22:55] Powell also directly linked part of the
[22:57] struggle at the bottom of the K to AI.
[22:59] You see a significant number of
[23:00] companies either announcing that they're
[23:01] not going to be doing much hiring or
[23:03] actually doing layoffs and much of the
[23:05] time they're talking about AI and what
[23:06] it can do. The reason this is important
[23:08] um if you go back and look at the
[23:10] statement from July and then the
[23:11] statement from September and then the
[23:13] statement from October
[23:15] in July did not even acknowledge AI as
[23:18] an impact to labor. In September there
[23:20] was a little bit of conversation and
[23:22] then at this one he highlighted that he
[23:24] is now speaking to companies. Remember I
[23:27] highlighted in September a lot of stuff
[23:28] happened. You had Bernie Sanders come
[23:30] out and basically say 100 million people
[23:32] are going to lose his job. You had 44
[23:33] economists including Ben Bernani and
[23:35] Janet Yellen sign a letter with other
[23:38] economists across the country telling uh
[23:41] to the secretary of labor saying that AI
[23:44] is going to have an impact and we need
[23:45] to start getting prepared for it. So
[23:48] this statement and everything going in
[23:49] pal rejected comparison between today's
[23:51] investment AI and the dotcom bubble
[23:53] emphasizing these companies actually
[23:55] have earnings. They're making strategic
[23:57] long-term bets on productivity.
[24:00] He called it a real and difficult issue
[24:02] for the US economy and that's because of
[24:04] the K-shape. So traditional pathways for
[24:07] employment are being hurt. Now
[24:11] Mandani wins in New York. Um and people
[24:15] start focusing on socialism and is this
[24:18] bearish for the market. Uh whatever your
[24:21] opinion is on politics, whatever it is,
[24:23] socialism has never proven to be good
[24:25] for stock markets or for anything in
[24:28] general. And Peter Teal basically was
[24:31] reminded or was uh bringing up again
[24:34] through X not from him but from people
[24:36] sorting around something he wrote in
[24:38] January 5th of 2020. Remember this is
[24:40] before COVID to Mark Zuckerberg, Cheryl
[24:42] Samberg and Mark Andre as well as
[24:43] others. I would be the last person to
[24:46] advocate for socialism. But when 70% of
[24:48] millennials say they are pro-
[24:50] socialists, we need to do better than
[24:52] simply dismiss them by saying that they
[24:54] are stupid. When one has too much
[24:55] student debt or if housing is too
[24:57] unaffordable, then one will have
[24:59] negative capital for a long time andor
[25:01] find it very hard to start accumulating
[25:03] capital in the form of real estate. And
[25:04] one if one has no stake in the
[25:07] capitalist system, then they may well
[25:08] turn against it. I am bringing this up
[25:10] because everyone should realize that
[25:12] this was going to happen not just due to
[25:15] AI but exponential innovation and the
[25:18] great financial crisis where the
[25:20] government had to get more involved had
[25:22] to let students throughout that and
[25:24] COVID basically have their debt delayed.
[25:28] All of this stuff has set this up where
[25:30] people believe they'd eventually be able
[25:31] to make money and then AI comes and hits
[25:33] them in the face. This is all related to
[25:35] exponential innovation and I'll go
[25:37] through why. 41% of recent college grads
[25:38] are under underd under underemployed.
[25:40] This is the word you need to think
[25:41] about. This is not an unemployment
[25:42] situation. We are not going to have a
[25:44] recession. But if a kid went to school
[25:46] to graduate with finance, can't get a
[25:48] finance degree, and ends up working at
[25:49] Whole Foods or ends up working in
[25:51] retail, that is undermployed. They're
[25:53] stuck in jobs that don't even need a
[25:54] degree per the New York Fed. Think about
[25:57] that. 41%.
[26:00] That's why socialism starts to rise. And
[26:03] this should not be this will not be the
[26:05] end of it. Did Joseph Shumper predict
[26:07] socialism and if so was what was an
[26:11] exact quote? Shumper predicted that
[26:12] capitalism would eventually undermine
[26:14] itself from within. So Joseph Shumper is
[26:16] an economist from the 1940s.
[26:19] Think about the prediction 85 years
[26:21] later. Not through an external socialist
[26:23] revolution, but because the very success
[26:25] of capitalism would erode the social and
[26:27] psychological foundations. The social
[26:29] and psychological foundations that kept
[26:32] it strong. If you don't believe there's
[26:34] a corporate ladder, you've been hit uh
[26:36] from a psychological basis. If you can't
[26:38] afford to go out and do things with
[26:41] friends, go out and eat, go out and
[26:42] drink, you've impacted the social side,
[26:44] you've impacted the confidence side, the
[26:46] empowerment side. He argued that the
[26:48] entrepreneurial entrepreneurial spirit
[26:50] and sense of individual stake in
[26:52] capitalism would decay as large
[26:54] companies, bureaucracies and elites
[26:56] replaced the small entrepreneur and
[26:57] younger generation who benefited from
[26:59] less ownership or independence turned
[27:00] structurally intellectually against the
[27:02] system. Capitalism inevitably by virtue
[27:05] of its own achievements creates educates
[27:07] and subsidizes a vested interest in
[27:10] social unrest.
[27:12] Basically, you get to the point where
[27:14] the intellectuals, the educated, the
[27:16] people start to vote against the system.
[27:18] Now, Milton Friedman came back and the
[27:20] reason that this is important to connect
[27:22] the two of them. He believes in
[27:24] capitalism and freedom, which everyone
[27:26] absolutely believes in. But if the
[27:27] current system isn't working and the
[27:29] educated people don't understand what it
[27:31] is, they just know that they can't
[27:32] afford to live in this. That's what
[27:33] drifts us that way. A society that puts
[27:36] equality before freedom will get
[27:38] neither. A society that puts freedom
[27:39] before equality will get a high degree
[27:41] of both. We've lost freedom and we've
[27:45] lost the ability to compete. And that's
[27:47] what he's talking about, the ability to
[27:49] compete. I do believe every person
[27:51] watching this and all people that have
[27:53] joined me for the first time, I am very
[27:56] very big on teaching kids, particularly
[27:58] college kids, how to embrace AI and how
[28:00] to get their trained to being
[28:02] entrepreneurs. You have to be an
[28:03] entrepreneur. You have to be willing to
[28:05] use AI to move into different things. AI
[28:07] is the the ability and using it is the
[28:10] ability to survive through this process
[28:11] and get more money. Freeman believed
[28:13] that economic freedom, the ability to
[28:15] choose your work, spend your money, own
[28:16] your property in voluntary exchange was
[28:18] the foundations of all other freedoms.
[28:20] If the state controlled economic life as
[28:22] in socialism, political and individ
[28:25] individual freedom would eventually
[28:26] vanish. That is the reason why to some
[28:29] degree socialism was going to happen.
[28:32] There will be more money that is handed
[28:33] out. I'm sure for the midterms, this is
[28:35] the another reason to be bullish. There
[28:37] will be more handouts. There will be
[28:38] more printing of money in some form. And
[28:41] this is what all leads to Bitcoin at the
[28:43] end of the day. And the reason why it's
[28:44] structural because there is no way to
[28:46] stop this process until AI starts to
[28:49] lower prices and we get toflation coming
[28:52] down at a basis and hopefully everyone
[28:54] has their job at that point. So you can
[28:56] read this stuff on your own, but the
[28:58] main point is a free society does not
[28:59] promise that anyone will succeed. It
[29:01] only offers the freedom to try. The urge
[29:03] to guarantee success leads inevitably to
[29:05] coercion. I'm here to help people with
[29:07] AI uh and to teach people how to do this
[29:10] stuff. So,
[29:13] let's just keep moving on and go into
[29:15] that's my little bit on uh on socialism
[29:17] and what happened in New York City. Now,
[29:20] we got more economic data. University of
[29:22] Michigan uh consumer confidence
[29:24] continues to collapse. This is the
[29:26] current conditions. We made new all-time
[29:29] lows. This is back to 1980.
[29:33] I just want to remind people when you
[29:34] hear bubble talk, this is where we were
[29:37] just before the NASDAQ bubble peaked in
[29:40] 2000. This is where we were at the
[29:43] bottom of the great financial crisis.
[29:45] Here's where we are now below that
[29:47] level. Nowhere near that level. This is
[29:49] not a bubble. This is a K-shaped economy
[29:52] that is seeing profit margins go higher
[29:55] because the labor market is under
[29:56] pressure and because the adoption of AI
[29:58] is leading to more efficiency. Um this
[30:01] is uh the uh consumer confidence uh
[30:06] expectations relative to the misery
[30:08] index. The misery index is the
[30:09] unemployment rate plus the inflation
[30:10] rate. So this is inverted. So, we're at
[30:14] a level right now where everyone should
[30:16] be confident because anyone who's got a
[30:18] problem with inflation at 3 point
[30:20] something% which is nothing. It's even
[30:22] less than wages has the ability of
[30:25] getting a job because the unemployment
[30:26] rate is four. So, you get this 7.3 the
[30:28] combination of the two but sentiment is
[30:29] down here. So, a lot of this actually is
[30:32] psychological. A lot of this can be
[30:34] changed over time but people need to be
[30:36] empowered. Um I do think that this is a
[30:39] perma situation that we're in. This is
[30:41] expected income versus the unemployment
[30:44] rate inverted. So, normally when people
[30:46] are expecting that their income is going
[30:47] to decrease, which is basically what
[30:49] this says, the unemployment rate's much
[30:51] worse. Everyone has a job basically
[30:53] still. Um, not everyone, but we're near
[30:55] all-time lows in this. Um, this is an
[30:58] important one just as a leading
[30:59] indicator in my opinion. Small business
[31:02] profits. So, small business profits are
[31:05] starting to go higher. Uh, this survey
[31:08] is back to 1980. This is overlaid again
[31:10] with the consumer confidence. So, we
[31:11] haven't seen this tick higher. I think a
[31:13] lot of this has to do with politics at
[31:15] this point, but I think the small
[31:16] businesses are sending a good signal for
[31:17] the PMIs because here it is overlaid
[31:20] with the PMIs. Small businesses are
[31:22] getting better. Domestic side is getting
[31:25] better. And when you go through the PMI
[31:27] numbers, you will realize uncertainty,
[31:29] uncertainty, uncertainty, wild
[31:31] fluctuations, unpredictability,
[31:33] volatility. This is from the most recent
[31:35] ISM number. We still have new orders
[31:37] relative to inventories at a healthy
[31:40] level. But you saw the S&P global
[31:42] manufacturing PMI has a very different
[31:44] chart and is near the highs of the last
[31:45] four years. The ism the PMI is down
[31:48] here. The difference between the two is
[31:51] one is highly focused on domestic. The
[31:53] other one is more focused on
[31:55] international and in particular depends
[31:57] a lot on imports and exports. Higher
[31:59] production underpinned by fastest demand
[32:02] growth in 20 months. Tariffs still weigh
[32:04] on exports and underpin further steep
[32:06] rises in prices. Uh growth was
[32:10] domesticled as new exports fell. The
[32:12] export and import side has been one of
[32:14] the main points of this. So you have to
[32:17] think that now that we're through the
[32:19] tariff situation and yes I realize they
[32:21] might be reversed by the Supreme Court
[32:23] in a in four to eight weeks. Uh but
[32:27] we'll deal with that when we come to it.
[32:28] The uncertainty index. This is the
[32:30] economic Bloomberg economic or US
[32:32] economic policy uncertainty index
[32:34] produced by Baker Bloom and Davis still
[32:37] sitting near all-time highs. But more
[32:39] importantly is the duration. This is the
[32:41] 10month average of that. The prior times
[32:45] COVID the prior time the great financial
[32:47] crisis. So we're at levels where there's
[32:50] a lot of money market cash. There's a
[32:52] lot of people that haven't done stuff.
[32:53] There's a lot of PMI new order demand
[32:56] that has to be filled. inventories are
[32:57] being drawn down. You're in a situation
[33:00] where as this comes down, and it still
[33:02] has not come down much. This 10-month
[33:03] average is 404. The most recent reading
[33:06] for November was 380, which comes in
[33:08] around here. We're still even above what
[33:10] the 10-month average was here, but we
[33:12] just got the China US truce. So,
[33:15] remember, we haven't been in this
[33:16] position at any point until now. Uh and
[33:20] I want to highlight again the PMIs are
[33:22] going higher because the amount of
[33:24] dollars being spent on the capex side is
[33:26] massive. And again to highlight that
[33:28] this just started. This is DRAM prices
[33:31] which have accelerated as I highlighted
[33:33] since September. This is a function of
[33:36] the data centers. So the buildout the
[33:38] prices for this it's going on massively
[33:40] now around the globe. This is the driver
[33:42] of everything. This has shot higher
[33:45] recently. So PMIs overlaid with it.
[33:48] you're going to get a move higher.
[33:49] [snorts] Um the PMIs,
[33:53] this is the uh fivemonth average of the
[33:55] export index of PMI. So just to show how
[33:58] low it is. Exports are as low on a
[34:00] five-month basis as they were during
[34:02] COVID when we had shutdowns. This here
[34:05] is an important indicator to watch which
[34:08] as this ticked higher. We got a sharp
[34:10] move higher in this. This is the
[34:11] transport sector relative to the S&P. A
[34:14] lot of guys who used to work for me have
[34:15] been waiting for this to go higher. I
[34:17] was at a dinner this week. We talked
[34:18] about transports. Some good stuff going
[34:20] on in transports. Finally, we just had
[34:23] the biggest weekly move.
[34:26] Sorry, this is an 8day rate of change on
[34:28] the transports relative to the S&P. So,
[34:30] that same chart you just saw, this is
[34:32] the biggest move since coming uh coming
[34:35] out of uh 2022 after rate hikes and then
[34:38] before that the COVID problem. So, we
[34:41] are starting to see and if you look at
[34:42] the chart, last week was a great weight.
[34:44] This is on an absolute base. This is the
[34:46] transport index. It actually made its
[34:47] highest closing level since July while
[34:49] the S&P was going down. This looks like
[34:52] a reverse head and shoulders. We get
[34:54] above this level. John Ro and I have
[34:56] been talking about this. Some of the
[34:57] names are starting to break out. This is
[34:59] one of those places that from a trading
[35:00] perspective I'd be looking at
[35:02] transports. You've already had CHRW
[35:05] uh CH Robinson come out and have an AI
[35:08] Bumpara stocks up 50% uh since its lows
[35:11] in May. I would just start paying
[35:13] attention to the transports because
[35:15] here's COVID.
[35:17] Sorry. Here's the tariffs. This is
[35:18] liberation uh time. This is when the
[35:20] tariff fears started. And this orange
[35:22] line here is PMI exports. The export
[35:25] level has been incredibly low as I've
[35:27] mentioned. If I do a five-month average,
[35:29] you can see how long we've been down
[35:30] here. This is
[35:33] the the PMI for the uh the S&P Global.
[35:36] So, this is really the difference
[35:38] between the two. If all of a sudden
[35:39] we're going to start seeing more imports
[35:41] and exports, think exports. Soybeans are
[35:44] going to happen and go to China, they're
[35:45] going to order a massive amount, just
[35:47] that revving up may be enough to get
[35:49] things going. But also knowing what the
[35:51] tariff situation is in China for one
[35:53] year is a big deal. It means people can
[35:56] order stuff and not have to go through
[35:57] this process. So I would watch for the
[36:00] China US truths to filter through. The
[36:02] one thing I've learned over the years,
[36:03] transports are a leading indicator for a
[36:05] reason. The reason they're a leading
[36:07] indicator for the reason is because
[36:08] hedge funds and anyone that uses
[36:09] alternative data has global satellites
[36:11] on everything going on from the trucking
[36:13] side. So the stocks start being the
[36:14] shorts start being covered the second
[36:17] that the quant strategy start to see
[36:19] that they should be covering it and that
[36:21] will lead to PMIs going higher. We're
[36:24] not there yet, but the transport chart
[36:25] did phenomenal last week. I would be
[36:27] paying attention particularly since
[36:28] energy was the best performing sector
[36:30] because that's the other place that you
[36:32] would cover short shorts if all of a
[36:34] sudden transportation is going to pick
[36:35] up. Energy and transportation PMI
[36:37] related. Pay attention. S&P global
[36:39] manufacturing relative. Again, similar
[36:42] thing. This side is the PMI. So, this is
[36:44] the difference. It's the export imports.
[36:46] This is the thing that's kept it down. I
[36:47] would pay attention. All right. The AI
[36:49] recap pretty quickly. Not a lot in AI
[36:51] this week. Podcast wise, definitely
[36:53] listen to the BG2 podcast. He had on
[36:56] Satcha Nadella and Sam Alman. Uh, again,
[36:59] Sam Alman was I don't know, kind of a
[37:04] jerk on the thing. And that that's what
[37:05] got a lot of press. But they did cover a
[37:07] lot of things. They covered AGI because
[37:09] the deal that their structure between
[37:11] Microsoft and OpenAI is on this. I don't
[37:13] know how they're going to figure that
[37:14] out. Went through the compute versus the
[37:15] revenue. No compute glut. Saja Nadella
[37:19] did talk a lot about the SAS business
[37:21] being under pressure, the agent tier
[37:23] replacing this, the golden age of margin
[37:25] expansion, but also just this concept of
[37:28] token factories. And this gets back into
[37:30] the buildout and how important it is.
[37:32] Uh, worth the listen. Not a great
[37:34] listen, but worth it. Um, this is the
[37:36] part where a big question I keep hearing
[37:38] is how OpenAI
[37:40] do 13 billion in revenue but have $1.4
[37:42] trillion spending. I think it's
[37:44] important just to stay on top of this
[37:45] stuff because Gersonner is an an
[37:47] investor in Open AI. So, for him to talk
[37:49] about it, you should hear the response
[37:50] if you haven't heard of it. That's why
[37:52] these types of podcasts are important.
[37:54] Gavin Baker, someone I've referenced on
[37:56] here, one of my favorite people to
[37:57] listen to along with Gersonner in the
[37:59] space, was interviewed at A16Z. Again,
[38:01] another good one to listen. We are not
[38:03] in a bubble. Unlike the 2000 telecom
[38:05] bubble with 97% dark fiber, meaning the
[38:10] fiber that was laid down, we didn't need
[38:13] it. Demand wasn't high enough. Well,
[38:14] there are no dark GPUs. They are all
[38:17] fully being utilized. So, yes, ROI and
[38:20] AI capex, another risk that people see.
[38:23] Already raised big tech return on
[38:26] invested capital by 10 points. So, he's
[38:28] saying we're not even close to what
[38:30] people will be worried about. We may get
[38:31] there. He's very honest on this, but
[38:33] we're not anywhere close to it. Spending
[38:35] is existential, meaning it has to
[38:36] happen. Larry Page from Google
[38:38] supposedly said he'd rather go bankrupt
[38:40] than lose this AGI race. Again, the
[38:43] spending is going to happen. The ROCIC
[38:45] is there. And he even acknowledges the
[38:47] roundt tripping, saying there is round
[38:48] tripping, but they're minor money is
[38:50] fungeible, but not small scale. if you
[38:53] want to go listen to it. the artificial
[38:55] intelligence show. Again, I've
[38:56] highlighted Paul Rutzer. I last week I
[38:59] did I listen this is one of the ones I
[39:00] listen to every week. You guys ask uh
[39:02] they cover a lot of different topics.
[39:04] They cover a lot on the labor side. They
[39:06] did here they talked about PAL warning
[39:08] job creation is pretty close to zero and
[39:10] saying the um companies are telling it's
[39:12] a bifrocated economy. Agents still
[39:15] early. They even highlight they can only
[39:17] automate at this point 1 to 2 and a.5%.
[39:19] So I want you to think about that. So if
[39:22] Karpathy says agents are it's still
[39:24] early. They're acknowledging in this
[39:26] it's early but they're also saying by
[39:28] the end of next year it could be 7 to 10
[39:31] times this number. That's the adoption
[39:33] that's coming. Mker really big story.
[39:36] I've highlighted to a lot of people
[39:38] still have yet to meet a person that
[39:40] spent the time on it. Merker Mkerker
[39:41] Murker very very important. They just
[39:43] raised money at $10 billion. This the
[39:46] founder is 22 years old. They are
[39:48] creating the reinforcement learning
[39:50] economy. Again, this is going to have
[39:53] impacts on training for all jobs. This
[39:56] is highly highly deflationary. The
[39:58] Wharton survey, 75% of leaders report
[40:00] positive gen ROI. They go through that
[40:03] report as well. So, MKER, if you guys
[40:06] haven't seen it, they're training people
[40:08] to with domain expertise
[40:10] to train the models. So, these are
[40:12] expert model training and they're
[40:14] talking about how these are jobs that
[40:16] people can go get today. They need more.
[40:17] They have th They're doing this 30,000
[40:20] workers so far that are doing this for
[40:22] this company. They need them for every
[40:24] job. These will be jobs that then could
[40:26] be brought even into places. So, this is
[40:29] a way for people who use AI to get paid.
[40:31] They're $50 to $100 $140. And if you
[40:34] doubt this is happening, it is
[40:36] happening. Here's a report if you want
[40:39] to read on how it'll become. And they're
[40:41] arguing that we're not going to replace
[40:43] uh people. People are going to be
[40:44] working aside from machines. And this is
[40:46] the argument about the positive side.
[40:48] There's somewhere in the middle. I think
[40:50] it's going to be a little bit more
[40:51] disruptive uh in terms of the
[40:53] psychological side as I mentioned. But
[40:55] there's no doubt in my mind that we are
[40:56] not going to lose all labor in the next
[40:58] 5 years to highlight to you from a
[41:00] personal experience. So this is my
[41:02] LinkedIn and email I get from them. I
[41:04] have have a consulting business for AI
[41:07] and for crypto. And here we go. Mker
[41:10] Mker Mker. These are job listings for me
[41:13] for consulting side in terms of looking
[41:15] for places that are looking for
[41:16] consultants. Here are the prices. $70 to
[41:19] $70 an hour. 90 to 200,000 a year. Half
[41:22] of these jobs are Mker. It's happening
[41:25] already. Palunteers earnings came out. A
[41:27] name that retail loves but institutions
[41:30] hate because of the valuation and
[41:32] because Alex Karp is always out there.
[41:35] But they are incredibly important to
[41:37] getting a sense as to the adoption side.
[41:39] Will we be seeing profit margins go
[41:41] lower? The easiest way for profit
[41:43] margins to get better is by more people
[41:45] using AI. So these guys, the adoption of
[41:48] AI across industries has reached a new
[41:50] level with enterprises now seeking real
[41:52] operational deployments, not just
[41:54] pilots. We are seeing unprecedented
[41:56] demand from both existing and new
[41:58] customers deploying full-scale AI
[42:00] architecture to address regulatory risk,
[42:02] supply chain, and productivity
[42:04] challenges. If you're a business leader
[42:06] or someone who has not adopted AI or are
[42:08] still sitting there worried about it,
[42:09] you are falling way behind, reach out to
[42:11] me. AI is no longer theoretical for our
[42:13] clients in manufacturing, healthcare,
[42:15] transportation. Remember CH Robinson?
[42:17] Our platform is being used to drive
[42:19] outcomes. I don't know if Palanteer is
[42:21] involved with this, but I will tell you
[42:23] that companies need to be using
[42:25] artificial intelligence. Every major
[42:27] company we speak with now has AI
[42:29] adoption on their boardroom agenda. Our
[42:32] commercial pipeline for AI deals has
[42:34] doubled quarter over-arter. Think about
[42:36] that. Palanteer was already going higher
[42:39] and in the last quarter commercial deals
[42:41] have doubled. Commercial revenue is up
[42:44] 121% year-over-year. Customers increased
[42:46] by 45%. They signed 204 agreements over
[42:50] 1 million each in the quarter.
[42:54] Palanteer's commercial pipeline has
[42:55] doubled quarter on quarter. All right.
[42:58] So this is the um substack that I
[43:01] posted. This is the X sign. I got 2.7
[43:04] million views. I appreciate all you guys
[43:05] for not only viewing it, but obviously
[43:07] spreading it around. I had a lot of nice
[43:09] contacts and and meetings with people.
[43:11] I'll be doing a lot more podcast. So I
[43:14] want to take you guys through the charts
[43:15] that support this idea and some of the
[43:17] stories and also help to give you some
[43:19] artificial intelligence on how you can
[43:21] do these types of brainstorming on your
[43:24] own. So here's the chart and the channel
[43:26] that Bitcoin has been in. We went down
[43:28] to the bottom ends of the channel. We
[43:29] held. I think we're doing exactly what
[43:31] we need to do. It is still sort of a
[43:34] postapocalyptic
[43:36] time period from the 2021 period. And
[43:38] this is what the Bitcoin IPO was about.
[43:41] Bitcoin has gone higher. The altcoins
[43:43] have not. You have not taken out the
[43:44] highs in basically anything else except
[43:46] for Bitcoin and Ethereum for about a
[43:49] week. Other than that, this reminds me a
[43:51] lot of the post.com bubble. And so I've
[43:54] talked about this as an IPO. We've had
[43:56] massive amounts of selling that started
[43:58] in May all throughout this period by
[44:00] OGs. I'll show some of that information.
[44:02] But somehow another the channel has
[44:04] worked itself higher.
[44:06] Fear has now reached basically similar
[44:09] levels to the last lows that occurred
[44:11] before we had the rally. This is the way
[44:13] that bull markets trade. You get
[44:15] consolidation, you get fear dropping
[44:17] off, and then you get the next wave. And
[44:19] the next wave usually spikes up to the
[44:21] next one and forces people in. We get
[44:22] overbought again. we get into the greed
[44:24] side which we never did back here and
[44:26] that's why this doesn't feel at all like
[44:27] a blowoff top as Pomp and I talked
[44:30] about. I want to remind people the
[44:33] reason I think this is an IPO is because
[44:35] of this and I want you to just pay
[44:37] attention. So I was trading uh indexes
[44:40] at Morgan Stanley and running the ETF
[44:42] business at the peak in 2000. This was a
[44:44] large book for the firm. We were
[44:46] dominating in in options but also in
[44:49] ETFs. And this is the collapse that
[44:52] happened in the NASDAQ back then. So
[44:54] when people talk about a bubble, this
[44:56] was a bubble. And I want to reiterate
[44:58] the NASDAQ
[45:00] doubled in 99. Forget what it did in
[45:04] early 2000. It doubled, which I don't
[45:05] even have this whole thing here in 99.
[45:07] This is actually QQQ, but it is the
[45:09] NASDAQ. It doubled in 98. So you were up
[45:12] 100% in 98. You were up 85% 99. And then
[45:16] you still had a surge at the beginning
[45:17] part of the year and eventually
[45:18] collapsed to finish down for 2000. It
[45:22] took forever
[45:24] basically 16 years from the peak for the
[45:27] Q's to get through the intraday highs.
[45:31] During this period in here, look what
[45:33] happened. The grind, the grind, the
[45:36] grind. Then a collapse in the great
[45:38] financial crisis. This is when Google
[45:41] IPOed
[45:42] during this whole situation where it was
[45:44] going sideways. This is when
[45:46] Salesforce.com IPOed. They IPOed in
[45:49] here. They want they would have been
[45:50] better off IPOing in here, but they
[45:53] raised the capital in here and the VCs
[45:55] were trapped with bad investments that
[45:57] sat there. This is very similar to me
[45:58] like crypto. The overhang after the
[46:00] bubble burst 2002. Many stocks were
[46:02] trading below their IPO prices. We have
[46:04] a similar situation going on right now.
[46:06] VC and insider investors desperate
[46:08] liquidity or redemption sold into every
[46:10] rally. That's what's happened to me for
[46:12] Salana, Ethereum, for every altcoin, for
[46:14] Bitcoin. VC and insider investors. These
[46:18] are the people that were the initial
[46:20] investors, the whales back then.
[46:23] Analysts at the time referred to as a
[46:24] lockup overhang that created persistent
[46:27] supply ceiling for tech equities. This
[46:29] is why you don't get bearish during this
[46:31] and that you be grateful that right now,
[46:34] every time there's a fall-off, just like
[46:35] there was back in NASDAQ, there was
[46:37] money going to work in it. Again, it
[46:38] took 16 years for the NASDAQ. It's not
[46:41] going to take that long. We're already
[46:42] now about four years past the peak in
[46:46] crypto. Everything is about one-third in
[46:48] the time period of the NASDAQ, which
[46:50] means to me we're near the ending of
[46:51] this already for altcoins and for
[46:54] everything, the ones that are real. You
[46:56] had the venture fund dimension, LP
[46:58] redemption pressures, underwater
[47:00] portfolios, limited ability to raise new
[47:01] funds. Think about the endowments. Think
[47:03] about the private equity market. Think
[47:04] about the private credit market. VC's in
[47:07] no different period. And you have AI
[47:09] that has come out and been a headwind.
[47:12] So here's all the OG selling. I mean,
[47:15] it's very clear at this point. Super
[47:17] whales cashing out of Bitcoin.
[47:21] That's why it feels like the pressure.
[47:22] Another thing that feels the same when
[47:24] the NASDAQ got up here. Look at how
[47:25] volatile it was in 2000 and 2001 and
[47:29] then we eventually went down and then
[47:31] there was no V. The NASDAQ or the Q's
[47:33] actually traded with a 15 V on average
[47:35] for a period of three years leading into
[47:37] the great financial crisis. Looks a lot
[47:40] like Bitcoin V collapsing and going
[47:42] down. This is the maturity side. This is
[47:44] why I brought it up in there. The e
[47:46] crypto ecosystem today rhymes with the
[47:48] postcom period. the capital overhang
[47:51] entrepreneurs risk tolerant falls after
[47:53] a bus. You have a lot of people that
[47:54] either left it or people that don't want
[47:56] to get involved in it again and and
[47:58] again the people that have survived are
[48:00] just trying to cash out because they
[48:01] need money on it. There's a lot of this
[48:03] overhang that's there and you've had
[48:05] policy and market resets. The good thing
[48:07] is this time unlike where you went
[48:08] through Sarbain Oxley global research
[48:11] analyst settlement you had all these
[48:13] things we're now in a positive period.
[48:15] This should end up speeding it up. Time
[48:18] to recover.
[48:20] VC cleanup cycles, regulatory resets.
[48:22] All of this is good. Expect a prolonged
[48:24] cleanup and concentrate phase in private
[48:26] markets with AI capturing the marginal
[48:28] VC dollar. This is a really critical
[48:30] point. AI is capturing the marginal VC
[48:32] dollar. And as I've said on Pomp and I
[48:34] wrote in, unfortunately, crypto is
[48:37] connected to some degree to two
[48:39] elements. The private market and again
[48:41] it does through the VC world. A VC was a
[48:43] very big funding part of what had
[48:45] happened. If you're not able to raise
[48:46] funds for anything and in particular
[48:48] crypto because you're not taking any of
[48:50] these investments that take a long term
[48:52] to play out, it's really hard when
[48:54] endowments and pension funds and
[48:55] insurance companies are licking their
[48:57] wounds from this. The global private
[48:59] markets report crypto may be liquid, but
[49:02] for the tokens and the altcoins and all
[49:04] that stuff, they're not liquid. They're
[49:05] not the same. This is something where
[49:06] you have to have a long-term viewpoint.
[49:08] And unfortunately, the private markets
[49:11] become a comparison for this. So global
[49:13] private markets navigated conditions
[49:16] 2024 leading to an uneven recovery. But
[49:18] think about all the issues going on in
[49:19] private credits right now, private
[49:22] equity right now. So the venture market
[49:25] today, a triple shock. You've got
[49:26] crypto, you've got SAS, these are the
[49:29] losses. And then you've got AI. This is
[49:31] the competition. So AI is a competitor
[49:33] right now. And like I said, that's where
[49:35] you're going to get your tenbagger. So
[49:37] here's the chart of all coins. still not
[49:41] taking out the highs of 2021.
[49:44] Still basically unchanging here. But
[49:46] this is a very positive looking chart
[49:47] and to me looks a lot feels a lot like
[49:50] the NDX. Here's Google. So Google IPOs
[49:53] in 2004 and this looks a lot like the
[49:56] way Bitcoin is trading. You go up, you
[49:59] go down, you consolidate. I mean, this
[50:01] is over the course
[50:04] of into 2007. So you're talking about
[50:06] one, two, three years from their IPO.
[50:08] They had four consolidations on this and
[50:10] I don't want to scare people but then
[50:12] even in Google you went from basically
[50:14] this high in 2006 all the way to 2012
[50:16] low and you hadn't done anything. This
[50:19] is what happens even with technologies
[50:20] that end up winning. Bitcoin at the end
[50:22] of the day is a very very big part of
[50:25] the digital economy. It is also part of
[50:27] like I said this is the overlay with the
[50:29] Renaissance IPO ETF. When IPOs
[50:34] underperform or when retail
[50:35] underperforms, Bitcoin, that's a lot of
[50:37] the fuel that comes with it. If OGs are
[50:39] selling, you need the option buying.
[50:41] You've got Bitcoin miners that are still
[50:42] overwriting. You have Asian investors
[50:44] looking for yield that are still
[50:46] overwriting. It has performed excellent
[50:49] with all of the selling pressure. It
[50:50] still may go lower, but you have to have
[50:52] a time frame and ability to look through
[50:55] during these consolidations when fear is
[50:57] this low. This is Bitcoin overlaid with
[50:59] that spec name index. I just want to
[51:01] show this because these are the things
[51:02] that are directly correlated with it and
[51:05] it has an impact even on MSTR and the
[51:08] premium. So Micro Strategy has lost
[51:10] everything as V has come down and as
[51:13] interest in Bitcoin and as the spec
[51:15] names have gum. It is the holy trinity
[51:17] of problems that have occurred for Micro
[51:19] Strategy. Uh but in the end the NDX has
[51:22] continued to move higher and Bitcoin is
[51:25] correlated to AI. So AI is going to
[51:27] continue to drive profit margins. It's
[51:29] going to continue to drive the
[51:30] inequality. It's going to continue to
[51:32] drive socialism. These are not bad
[51:34] things for Bitcoin. Despite what people
[51:37] may have from the OG side, this is the
[51:40] inevitability. It has to be driven by
[51:42] the globe. It is not a dollar weakness
[51:44] story. It is not a US story. It is a
[51:47] global story. That is the reason why I
[51:48] got involved in it. For those people
[51:50] that have not watched it and are
[51:52] starting to get more interested in
[51:54] crypto,
[51:55] tech experts break down the incoming AI
[51:58] crypto collision that will redefine
[51:59] global power. This is the one podcast
[52:02] that you need to listen to. This was
[52:04] from Moonshots a couple months ago. I've
[52:06] highlighted it before. In my and these
[52:08] are the quotes, the most important
[52:09] quotes. In my mind, this is probably the
[52:11] most significant economic legislation
[52:13] and change that we've seen in our
[52:14] lifetimes. The implications are
[52:16] staggering. It completely rewires how
[52:19] the economy will work. Crypto is not a
[52:22] side invasion but the new financial
[52:23] layer of the internet comparable in
[52:25] impact to the creation of the internet
[52:26] itself. For the first time, the internet
[52:29] gets its financial layer. And when we
[52:30] give our AI agents, again, this is why
[52:33] Bitcoin is the purest AI trade. You may
[52:36] not like it today because you don't see
[52:39] it. I see it. And the reason I see it is
[52:41] because all of the assets will
[52:43] eventually be moving over to the digital
[52:46] economy. Once you open up these wallets
[52:48] and the money is there and Bitcoin is
[52:49] outperforming, it will get more and more
[52:52] because AI agents are the key to the
[52:54] future of crypto, it will get access to
[52:57] that. The economy will explode. AI is
[52:59] intelligence. Crypto is money. Together,
[53:00] they form the new operating system for
[53:02] the global economy. Watch the episode.
[53:04] And finally, you know tokenization is
[53:08] coming when the IMF has what is
[53:10] tokenization
[53:12] and they have a video that you can go
[53:14] watch. That's it for me. Uh again,
[53:17] thanks to everyone who joined for the
[53:19] first time. Hopefully you learned
[53:21] something. I'll be back next week. See
[53:23] youa.
