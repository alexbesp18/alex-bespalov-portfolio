--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] post holiday week of the second half of
[00:03] the year and a lot went on. A lot of
[00:06] important uh points to go through today.
[00:10] Uh tariff man's back. Stocks don't care
[00:12] as of yet, but we are seeing momentum
[00:15] fall and is it a warning sign uh for a
[00:18] repeat of uh what we saw in the first
[00:21] quarter? Uh I'm expecting a PMI surprise
[00:24] and I'll go through why. Michael Dell
[00:26] was on the BG2 pod again. best pot out
[00:30] there right now on tech and a must
[00:32] listen to every time it comes out. And
[00:34] then big breakout for crypto and owning
[00:38] crypto is no longer a speculative
[00:39] position. Failing to do so is. So, let's
[00:43] get right to it. Uh like I said, tariff
[00:46] man is back. This will start to dominate
[00:50] people's minds, but uh this week the S&P
[00:52] just hung near the all-time highs. We're
[00:54] still in the blackout window for for
[00:56] buyouts. So, uh, I would not be
[00:59] surprised to continue to see some
[01:01] sideways action here, uh, and maybe even
[01:04] a little bit of a correction because,
[01:06] uh, I do think, uh, he's, uh, he's in
[01:09] the final stages of some of these
[01:10] negotiations. Is going to be more
[01:12] aggressive now that the big beautiful
[01:13] bill is done. Uh, month to date, we're
[01:17] seeing, uh, energy lead the way.
[01:20] Materials the same thing. Industrials
[01:22] third best. you got all the growth uh
[01:24] areas on on the top side uh which I
[01:27] think is an important sign which I'll
[01:29] get into uh and the Russell is leading
[01:33] the way. So small cap so far have
[01:35] outperformed by about 2% for the month.
[01:38] Uh they've obviously been a big short
[01:40] position for people. Same type of names
[01:42] are leading here. Energy again uh as
[01:45] I've talked about I'm a big believer
[01:47] that second half of the year is about
[01:48] energy and power. Mag 7 is just
[01:51] continuing to grind. Uh again, a lot of
[01:54] dispersion. You've got three of the
[01:55] names down year to date. You have three
[01:57] of the names up big year to date. And
[01:58] then you have Amazon near unchanged. I
[02:00] think the Mag 7 is going to continue to
[02:03] uh see multiples come down but not see
[02:08] their earnings uh drop off. Uh you're
[02:11] starting to see the banks after they
[02:12] panicked in the first part of the year.
[02:14] You got Bank of America lifting up. Um I
[02:17] did think that when you read through
[02:19] what they said down here. Medium uh
[02:23] long-term outlook is warm but hot
[02:26] against bonds.
[02:28] Aging demographics and sticky inflation
[02:30] create a compelling supply and demand
[02:31] case for inflationproof income and
[02:34] easily favor stocks over bonds. Could
[02:36] not agree more, especially with profit
[02:38] margins benefiting from AI. Uh Goldman
[02:41] again re revised stuff up. So, you know,
[02:44] if if you listen to the banks in the
[02:46] first quarter, it was a mistake. We'll
[02:47] see what the second half does. Uh but
[02:50] calling for uh for weakness and uh and
[02:54] bare markets is just not a a good
[02:57] business to be in when you have uh AI
[03:00] accelerating and the government deciding
[03:01] they're going to spend uh rather than be
[03:04] austere. Uh tenure rates
[03:08] remain sitting in check. So nothing in
[03:11] there. They're just uh remaining in the
[03:14] range. Uh Marco just can't seem to not
[03:18] be bearish. Uh I can't find many tweets
[03:22] from him where he isn't other than
[03:24] tactical things. And again, he's
[03:25] continuing to highlight uh what I
[03:28] mentioned at the beginning that the
[03:29] momentum factor has sold off back in
[03:32] Fed. It led to the S&P pullback. Uh so
[03:35] far, it's not doing anything, but I did
[03:36] want to go through because I think it's
[03:38] important. Um here you go. Market
[03:40] rotation put shine on S&P losers.
[03:43] You're getting the underperformers
[03:46] winning. Russell 2000 or Russell 1000
[03:48] has seen a clear rotation out of the
[03:50] first half winners into the biggest
[03:51] losers. The 20 worst performing stocks
[03:54] of the first half of the year have
[03:55] gained four and a 5.4%. A lot of that
[03:58] again when you think about energy uh the
[04:00] best and then uh the 20 best performing
[04:03] names have been down. So you're getting
[04:05] it from both sides right now. Those
[04:07] rotations uh of momentum they usually
[04:10] happen at regime shifts. I think we're
[04:11] at one now. I'm not going to go through
[04:13] this, but the same type of thing. You
[04:15] can see the sector differentials. And
[04:17] remember, right now, small caps,
[04:19] speculators are the most short small
[04:21] caps since 2024. Uh, back here, this is
[04:25] a major ripper. Uh, and again, this
[04:27] occurred during the summer of last year,
[04:30] right around the fears over the SA rule.
[04:33] So recession type situation, but then
[04:35] also coming out of it, uh, when the Fed
[04:39] cut rates, that's when you started to
[04:40] get Trump and everyone everything
[04:42] started to turn the other direction.
[04:43] Here's the monthly for pure momentum.
[04:46] Um, you know, we saw the weakness in uh,
[04:50] in January. We saw the weakness in
[04:53] March. This is so far month the worst
[04:55] month since the summer of last year and
[04:57] before that early 23. So momentum has
[05:01] been weak so far. And I'm going to go
[05:02] back through and just um highlight some
[05:05] of the similarities. So what you can see
[05:06] here is uh it lines up very very well
[05:09] with the market neutral 3-month
[05:11] revision. So three-month revisions uh
[05:14] performance are underperforming right
[05:16] now and that's leading to momentum to go
[05:18] down. So the same thing happened during
[05:20] the worst part of the equity market. Uh
[05:23] right now equities are not falling but
[05:25] again when people are bailing out of the
[05:28] revision the companies with revisions
[05:30] moving higher and moving into the
[05:32] companies where revisions have not been
[05:34] moving higher it's usually a bad sign.
[05:36] So what you have here is momentum is
[05:38] following it because that is uh the
[05:41] number one factor for uh for the equity
[05:43] market in terms of revisions. Technology
[05:45] is actually the worst right now. So
[05:48] again, if you're a technology company
[05:49] and your revisions have been moving
[05:51] higher, uh take whatever you want, any
[05:54] company that you've been following,
[05:56] whether there's Palunteer or any of the
[05:57] ones that have come out with earnings,
[05:59] well, now they're starting to
[06:00] underperform the ones on the downside
[06:02] where revisions haven't been moving
[06:04] higher. Uh so here's the overlay of the
[06:07] equity market versus pure momentum. So
[06:10] again, I started highlighting in here
[06:12] the issue that was going on with pure
[06:14] momentum. Equities ignored it at first.
[06:17] You went back up in momentum and then
[06:19] you went down violently. The equity
[06:20] market followed it. Momentum bounced
[06:22] from there and again most of the
[06:24] momentum stuff is related to the AI
[06:27] situation. Now what didn't happen and
[06:29] what's different this time is that size
[06:31] is following. So the size factor which
[06:34] is the white line here uh back when we
[06:37] started seeing the disconnect you had a
[06:40] negative correlation between the two.
[06:41] So, as size went higher, momentum went
[06:44] down, and then they started to get
[06:46] correlated back together again. Well,
[06:47] now they're correlated, they're going
[06:48] down, which means that as the winners
[06:51] are unwinding, sizes unwinding. Think
[06:54] about the Mag 7. Think about the the
[06:56] bigger companies again versus small cap.
[06:58] Now, I wrote this uh good timing, April
[07:02] 8th, in terms of
[07:04] uh this comment. One truth stands out.
[07:06] These times, if you can see past the
[07:07] fear, offer the best investment
[07:09] opportunities. much like much like the
[07:12] life lesson we impart to our kids that
[07:13] nothing worth having comes easy. I
[07:15] believe we are at one of those
[07:16] investment opportunities similar to when
[07:18] I wrote that uh and it's related to
[07:20] this. So we have been in a recession.
[07:23] I've talked about the fact that the
[07:24] economy has been in a recession for the
[07:27] manufacturing side and for anything
[07:29] related to the lei. So this is now
[07:32] basically between you know it's about 35
[07:35] months we've been in this. So almost 3
[07:38] years of recession levels for both the
[07:41] ISM or the PMI manufacturing PMI and the
[07:45] LEI. I think this is about to change and
[07:48] this is where I want to focus the
[07:49] attention for people on the investment
[07:50] side and I'll go through why. Now what I
[07:53] highlighted back uh when I first joined
[07:55] 22V and I did a webinar for the group
[07:57] there were these inflection points in
[07:59] pure momentum. So whenever pure momentum
[08:01] has had a downside move, it has lasted
[08:04] uh generally for a long period of time.
[08:07] This one did not. This one went right
[08:08] back up. These were all macro regime uh
[08:11] shift points. This one here was in 2022.
[08:14] This was the end the Fed or this was the
[08:16] Fed pivot. This was just before COVID.
[08:20] Uh this was in at the uh lows in 2016
[08:24] for uh the energy uh unwind. This is the
[08:28] China Shanghai accord and this is 2008.
[08:31] So what you normally find at these
[08:33] points is investors are all leaning on
[08:36] one theme and then something happens.
[08:37] Right now the clear theme is be invested
[08:40] in AI related things and be short
[08:42] anything related to manufacturing.
[08:44] Obviously the tariffs had worsened the
[08:46] situation. Uh I didn't highlight this
[08:49] and I I I probably should have. We went
[08:51] back to highs and now we're going down.
[08:53] I just want to highlight that I think
[08:54] that this point in here was something to
[08:57] pay attention to. I do think there was a
[08:59] regime shift that happened. I've written
[09:01] about it. I'll get into more about why I
[09:03] think it's going on. But this is really
[09:05] important for market neutral hedge
[09:06] funds. It's really important for hedge
[09:07] funds in general. I think the alpha
[09:09] opportunities are going to shift. Uh and
[09:11] again, the re the companies with
[09:13] revisions moving down are starting to
[09:14] outperform the companies with revisions
[09:16] that were moving up. That usually means
[09:18] there's a broadening out. This is the
[09:20] non sector neutralize momentum and again
[09:24] this is uh showing where manufacturing
[09:27] uh the PMI new orders component. These
[09:30] lines here are inflection points for MO
[09:34] where they didn't make a new high for at
[09:36] least a year. And these were all periods
[09:39] in time where you had a these are this
[09:42] is an inversion of the new orders. This
[09:45] was a bottom in new orders. A bottom in
[09:46] new orders bottom in new orders. bottom
[09:48] in new orders and right now I believe
[09:50] the same thing. This was a bottom here.
[09:52] I think the same thing is going to
[09:53] happen. I think new orders are going to
[09:55] start to move this way back up towards
[09:57] 60. Uh and that is not a consensus call
[10:01] right now. And I think this is something
[10:04] that is going to happen and I'll go
[10:05] through the reasons why we had this
[10:08] start and this is one of the things that
[10:09] I think is interesting. The new orders
[10:11] did get up to 55 back in December and
[10:13] January. And what had happened was Trump
[10:17] led to this enthusiasm. The PMIs are a
[10:20] survey of optimism and we had jumped
[10:23] higher. They are very important signal
[10:25] for quant strategies and for cyclical
[10:27] investments. And so I'm going to go
[10:29] through things that are already showing
[10:31] up. Now we came back down. The tariffs
[10:33] made everyone negative. Everyone through
[10:35] the tariffs are still going on. But the
[10:37] most important one to me is the China US
[10:38] one. I will continue to say that the
[10:40] China US trade deal was the most
[10:42] important thing of this uh and that has
[10:45] been resolved because of rare earth. Uh
[10:48] that is still not something that I think
[10:50] everyone is uh believing. They still
[10:52] believe there's risk that it can unwind.
[10:54] I just do not believe that the US can
[10:55] take uh the situation which I talked
[10:57] about a lot at the end of May and into
[10:59] June uh around rare earth. Now what
[11:03] things are showing the PMI already
[11:05] should be going higher. I'm going to go
[11:06] through a lot of different things here
[11:08] related to this being an AI trade.
[11:09] Again, I've said this before, I'll
[11:11] continue to say it. If you're a macro
[11:13] person and you're not doing all of your
[11:15] homework on artificial intelligence and
[11:17] the buildout for it, you have no chance
[11:19] of staying on top of the macro
[11:20] environment. If you're waiting for rates
[11:22] to move higher, you're betting against
[11:23] AI having the impact that it is from a
[11:25] deflationary perspective, which is
[11:26] what's showing up in the data. But at
[11:29] the same time, if you're fading the PMI,
[11:31] I think this is going to feel a lot like
[11:32] the software boom, except this time it's
[11:34] all around the embodiment of AI and the
[11:36] hardware side. So, what do we have here?
[11:38] Non-defense or uh non-defense XAIR
[11:43] uh durable goods, just this component.
[11:46] Now, we've made highs for the last three
[11:48] years. Again, this is overlaid with the
[11:50] PMI. So, this has already been going on.
[11:53] We're already seeing parts of the the
[11:56] hard side going higher. And I'm going to
[11:58] go through a lot of them. The revision.
[12:00] So this revision has gone higher. This
[12:03] is overlaid with the PMI. Again, this is
[12:06] because of tech revisions for the most
[12:08] part. The sector that has dominated in
[12:10] terms of revisions going higher has been
[12:12] technology that is related to AI. We're
[12:14] going to get through the next component
[12:15] of what's related to AI, but I think the
[12:18] revisions are going to start to move
[12:19] higher for other things. You have uh the
[12:22] Goldman Sachs non-commodity cyclical
[12:24] verse defense index which has been
[12:26] correlated to the PMI. It's been
[12:28] stretched up here. The part that's been
[12:30] missing has again been the hardware
[12:32] side. You've got a really important one
[12:35] on the factor side which is beta versus
[12:38] uh profitability. So beta versus
[12:39] quality. The white line here is at the
[12:42] highest level again since back in 22.
[12:45] This to me is the most powerful signal
[12:47] that is going on. that signals that we
[12:49] should be seeing the PMI move over. I
[12:51] think new orders are going to go first.
[12:53] The reason that this is going on and
[12:55] again beta like I showed you're getting
[12:57] a rotation and the rotation is out of
[12:59] the tech names and it is into the more
[13:02] economically sensitive names and
[13:04] especially at this point you have energy
[13:06] now joining but it's only joined so far
[13:08] this month. If energy goes I think this
[13:09] thing will continue to go. You'll see a
[13:11] move into beta short uh small caps will
[13:14] get covered. Small caps historically are
[13:15] very correlated to commodity strength.
[13:17] Uh that's the thing you want to watch.
[13:19] My risk grow index which I've shown on
[13:21] these videos over the last year which is
[13:23] a combination of the Asian dollar uh
[13:26] commodities using the CRB raw
[13:27] industrials uh and the global stock
[13:30] market ex the US in local terms. So it
[13:33] strips out the currency side from the
[13:35] equities. It uses the Asian dollar
[13:36] currency side. The Asian dollar currency
[13:38] side is actually manipulated lower uh or
[13:41] con constrained because of what's
[13:43] happening with the peg currency in China
[13:45] which is a big component of it. If you
[13:47] go through a lot of the other
[13:48] currencies, this will be much higher at
[13:49] this point. This is also signaling at
[13:51] this point that the PMI should be going
[13:53] high. There's a cyclical global, not US,
[13:56] global uh impulse that's going on.
[13:58] Commodities, this is copper. So, here's
[14:01] Dr. Copper uh breaking up higher. I do
[14:05] not think this is going to stop. I wrote
[14:07] a piece on it. I'll get into that later.
[14:09] Uh the hang in the DAX. This is
[14:11] something I created a long time ago. I
[14:13] used it as a cyclical signal. there's a
[14:15] very high very important relationship
[14:18] between China and Germany in terms of
[14:21] their uh economies and so I put a hang
[14:24] DAX together where I equal weighted them
[14:27] to overlay with the PMI. So this is
[14:29] basically 50% hang 50% DAX combined as
[14:33] one index. It has been storming higher
[14:35] this year led predominantly well they're
[14:38] actually both going higher but now we're
[14:40] starting to see a broader signal that
[14:41] had been there. I think that's going to
[14:43] continue to drag it higher. You also
[14:45] have the European banks. European banks
[14:46] have also been a very good signal. Think
[14:49] of them as the caboose of global growth.
[14:52] If the European banks are doing well,
[14:54] that usually means there's good stuff
[14:55] happening around the globe. Uh again,
[14:57] outside of the US. Next thing, currency.
[15:00] Taiwan dollar. I mentioned that the uh
[15:02] yuan is h keeping back the Asian dollar.
[15:05] Uh I talked about Taiwan and here John
[15:07] Ro and I did a video. This has continued
[15:10] to move higher as the Taiwanese dollar
[15:11] is strengthening. That is historically a
[15:13] good sign. remember a lot of important
[15:15] tech stuff in particular on the
[15:16] semiconductor side which is a big part
[15:18] of the PMI belief uh bet that I'm making
[15:21] uh not only European banks these are the
[15:23] Asian banks same thing so you have the
[15:25] Asian banks and the European banks just
[15:27] exploding higher uh as I showed last
[15:30] week I think the US banks are going to
[15:32] start to participate in this as well uh
[15:34] this is the Shanghai composite so the
[15:36] Shanghai composite overlaid with uh
[15:38] those uh Asian uh banks so when the
[15:41] Asian banks have historically won done
[15:43] well. Shanghai Composite in China has
[15:47] done well. Uh which is a very good
[15:48] cyclical sign. You have the Straight
[15:51] Times index, the Singapore index making
[15:53] new all-time highs. Very very related
[15:56] again. And then one of the economic data
[15:59] points that I think has probably been
[16:00] the most important over the last month
[16:02] is the fact that uh the German zoo has
[16:05] gone back up to effectively three-year
[16:07] highs. Again, a lot of these things
[16:08] we're going back to the 2022 area and
[16:11] that means that we're getting through
[16:13] and you have the impulse happening from
[16:15] the global rate cutting cycle going
[16:17] around the world. Uh, which I think is
[16:20] critical. Now, in terms of the PMI, the
[16:22] thing I want you to start thinking
[16:24] about, um, I wanted to basically give
[16:26] you the numbers from this beforehand.
[16:28] What was the estimate of the China
[16:29] urbanization capex from 2022 to 20, I'm
[16:32] sorry, 2002 to 2009? The total
[16:36] urbanization estimates exchange rate
[16:38] adjustment about $6 trillion. This is
[16:41] important because the China urbanization
[16:43] story was a structural given story. It
[16:46] was given because the Chinese government
[16:47] was funding it. It was a long-term plan.
[16:50] You don't see these too often and it had
[16:52] major implications for commodities and
[16:54] major implications for the investment
[16:55] thing. It was mainly through iron ore,
[16:58] through steel, through cement, through
[17:00] coal. Those were the primary vehicles.
[17:02] This one's different. This is $7
[17:04] trillion. It is a race to scale data
[17:07] centers
[17:08] and this is over the next five years.
[17:10] This is from McKenzie. These numbers are
[17:12] higher now. This was written before a
[17:14] lot of things went on. I'm going to go
[17:16] through this, but overall that's nearly
[17:17] 7 trillion in capital outlays that are
[17:20] needed by 2030. So over the next five
[17:23] years in terms of where are they going?
[17:26] This is local news of just all of the
[17:29] stuff going on. Local news across the US
[17:30] highlights a historic wave of data
[17:32] center and power plant construction
[17:33] driven by AI, cloud computing, and
[17:35] digital transformation. Projects span
[17:37] nearly every region with significant
[17:39] investments in both traditional and
[17:41] renewable power infrastructure to
[17:42] support the surging demand from new and
[17:44] ex expanding data centers. Uh for those
[17:49] people who want to get what I'm getting
[17:51] into now, people faded, including
[17:53] myself, uh Amazon throughout this entire
[17:56] period. This is a chart of the market
[17:57] cap of Amazon versus the market cap of
[18:00] Walmart. You can see that Walmart's
[18:01] market cap from 2000 to 2020 effectively
[18:04] stayed exactly the same. Went up
[18:06] slightly. If you faded Amazon, which
[18:09] most people did, I went to Silicon
[18:11] Valley here because I got sick of
[18:13] shorting it, not having a reason why.
[18:15] That's when I learned about this. If you
[18:17] go back to 2016 for whatever you think
[18:20] about Shamath uh from the All-In
[18:22] podcast, if you go listen to the uh Iris
[18:26] Som conference, he spoke at it back here
[18:29] when uh Amazon was about half a trillion
[18:32] dollar company and he said within 10
[18:34] years right here it would be a $3
[18:38] trillion company. Uh he's going to be
[18:40] right. So that how does someone project
[18:42] 10 years out in this? This is what most
[18:45] macro people are missing who are not
[18:46] spending time on AI because what is
[18:49] already happening is the same thing the
[18:51] data centers. So this is the data
[18:53] centers as part of construction. So when
[18:55] people look at construction which right
[18:57] now is around zero to slightly negative
[18:59] that is mainly on the residential
[19:01] housing side that is mainly on the
[19:03] commercial side those are not collapsing
[19:05] they're just kind of going sideways and
[19:06] going down a little bit while this is
[19:08] going fast. The problem you have is this
[19:10] is compounding right now at 40%. And
[19:13] this is before the explosion that is
[19:15] coming which will compound this even
[19:17] faster which means over time just like
[19:19] what happened with the mag 7 versus
[19:21] Walmart. Amazon verse Walmart. If you
[19:23] compound something at 40% a year and
[19:25] something at zero a year the zeroyear
[19:27] thing becomes completely irrelevant. All
[19:28] the jobs being created in the United
[19:30] States of America right now are
[19:31] healthcare and leisure which is why
[19:33] we're not going to have a recession. You
[19:35] have to pay attention to the exponential
[19:36] change that's happening due to the
[19:38] digital economy. Right now, what is
[19:39] going on is data center buildout is
[19:41] explosive. This is the construction
[19:43] data. Take it further. Look at the GDP
[19:45] side. This is the from GDP for Q1. This
[19:49] is the computer equipment side. So
[19:52] again, when you're building out data
[19:53] centers, you need massive amounts of
[19:54] semiconductors. This is the information
[19:57] processing side. These are the
[19:58] contribution
[20:00] or the growth, sorry, in Q1 for these
[20:03] things going back 30 years. We've never
[20:05] seen anything like this. So to fade the
[20:07] hardware build out is a huge mistake. It
[20:09] will have implications for PMIs and for
[20:12] GDP. Uh the AI boom is already here.
[20:15] Purchases of computer equipment, which
[20:16] is what I showed you. They added a full
[20:18] percentage point to GDP in Q1 of 2025.
[20:20] That's higher than the peak of the dot
[20:22] bubble. The future is now.
[20:25] And it's not stopping. So this is the
[20:28] the main point that I've been trying to
[20:29] get through to people is this is a
[20:31] structural issue. This is a race for
[20:33] military supremacy between China and the
[20:35] US. It will not stop. It's being funded
[20:37] both by the government. This is why
[20:39] you're getting this and at the same time
[20:41] obsolescence uh for the MAG7. You're
[20:44] seeing that with Mark Zuckerberg right
[20:45] now spending as much money as he can on
[20:47] people to try and play catchup for fear
[20:49] of obsolescence. Now the other part of
[20:51] the bill that is not just the data
[20:52] center. We are now getting into remember
[20:54] since Q1. The reason this is different
[20:57] than Q1 in terms of people that want to
[20:58] fade this, we got the big beautiful bill
[21:01] through. That means not only the tax
[21:03] cuts, but all the bonus depreciation,
[21:05] but we also had an executive order on
[21:07] nuclear to do three times the gigawatts
[21:10] that already exists in the US. That
[21:11] buildout will be massive. I've I've
[21:13] calculated in today's dollars at
[21:15] approximately $2.5 trillion. You can add
[21:18] that to the hyperscaler thing of 7
[21:20] trillion. You're talking about massive
[21:22] amounts in terms of the data center and
[21:24] the power needed to
[21:26] power it.
[21:28] And to highlight how much we're behind
[21:31] in terms of the energy and we have to do
[21:33] this, Elon Musk confirms XAI is buying
[21:36] an overseas power plant and shipping the
[21:38] whole thing to the US to power its new
[21:40] data center. So, he didn't want to wait
[21:42] through all of the delays that were
[21:44] going to happen. So, he literally bought
[21:46] a power plant and shipped it over. This
[21:48] is a given that is happening. Uh, I
[21:50] wrote a paper on on copper. I'm not
[21:52] going to go through the details on this
[21:54] for 22V, but this copper bull market
[21:57] isn't about a cyclical PMI recovery or a
[21:59] China reaceleration. It's about the
[22:00] structural reality of the AI buildout
[22:02] and the electrification needed to
[22:04] support it. This is a geopolitical race
[22:06] for military supremacy in a hyperscaler
[22:08] race to avoid obsolescence. the the
[22:11] comparison of this can only be to the
[22:14] Manhattan project to the space race from
[22:17] a geopolitical basis and from a
[22:19] guarantee in my opinion from the China
[22:21] urbanization. You do not want to fade
[22:22] this from a macro perspective and look
[22:24] for recessions. Uh you don't want to pay
[22:27] attention to old indicators. But now if
[22:29] we get the PMI going higher, you're
[22:31] going to have changes. This is copper
[22:33] over gold. Gold has been a big um
[22:35] obviously winner here. If we start to
[22:38] see the PMI go higher, don't be
[22:39] surprised if you see copper verse gold.
[22:41] But at a minimum, I would expect this to
[22:42] go higher. I've already highlighted that
[22:44] the best sharp ratio trade uh that
[22:46] represents this transition from the
[22:48] industrial to the digital economy is to
[22:50] be long copper short nickel. Sharp ratio
[22:53] has been insane. Uh remains the place to
[22:56] be. Now, outside of the US in terms of
[22:59] the uh the buildout, let's just go
[23:01] through what else is going on from a why
[23:04] would the PMI go higher. China set to
[23:06] ramp up and broaden its fiscal support
[23:07] in the second half of the year. One
[23:08] thing about the China US trade deal
[23:10] slash uh they want our our semiconductor
[23:14] software and chips. You saw some of the
[23:15] softing on the software side. I expect
[23:17] the export ban on some of the semis to
[23:19] have to be uh lowered as well uh because
[23:22] of the rare earth side. So I think both
[23:24] companies have agreed that for the next
[23:26] five years there's a truce in place on
[23:29] the trade side and what they have to do
[23:31] is like all good divorces they're going
[23:34] to spend the next five years in
[23:35] mediation and in trying to work out
[23:38] these difficulties where they buy their
[23:40] they build their own chips. We find our
[23:42] own rare earth uh kind of the baby in
[23:45] between is copper um because everyone's
[23:47] going to need it um and they both need
[23:49] to get it from outside. China's
[23:51] construction equipment sales surging.
[23:54] So, this is excavator sales, which have
[23:56] historically been a great sign for the
[23:57] builders, climbed almost 23% from a year
[24:00] earlier in the January to June period.
[24:03] So, we're seeing the early signs of this
[24:06] stuff going on. Um, and seeing an
[24:09] earnings improvement in listed firms in
[24:10] the first half, about 78% of the 170
[24:14] companies
[24:15] expected higher earnings or return to
[24:16] profitability. So, you're seeing it in
[24:18] terms of the price movements. I've said
[24:21] in terms of the you know the the the
[24:24] factors I went through the global
[24:26] markets I went through the currency I
[24:28] went through remember the dollar has
[24:29] been weaker that is usually very very
[24:31] good for PMIs you have Dr. copper
[24:33] breaking out. You have Cosby breaking
[24:34] out and then as John Rog put in here,
[24:37] you've got the Shanghai Composite 7 and
[24:39] a halfyear base. The chart looks
[24:41] fantastic. You got the MACD's now
[24:43] turning higher. Uh anytime you see the
[24:45] Shanghai Composite go up, it's usually a
[24:47] good sign for PMIs. And on the back end
[24:49] of China, whenever China does well,
[24:51] Australia does well. Um and this week,
[24:55] uh Australian business confidence had a
[24:57] significant improvement, climbed five
[25:00] points. uh basically the biggest move I
[25:04] think in two years maybe 3 years
[25:07] regardless going higher and then
[25:08] remember we have the German uh and the
[25:10] European defense spend which is going to
[25:12] happen. Uh again this defense spend is
[25:15] going to be related to technology. All
[25:17] of the equipment that is going to needed
[25:18] to be built is about future stuff. This
[25:21] will include humanoids, Cuba,
[25:22] everything. This is a big buildout but
[25:24] German spending ramp up fuels business
[25:26] optimism. German companies are the most
[25:28] optimistic about the company since early
[25:30] 2022. Good thing for PMIs. Firms plan to
[25:33] boost investments the first time in two
[25:35] years with a number of fans planning to
[25:37] increase capital expenditure research
[25:38] and spending outnumbering those
[25:40] anticipating cuts. China, Germany, the
[25:43] US and
[25:46] we have a PMI going up. We also have a
[25:48] president that wants rates to move lower
[25:49] immediately. The pressure on PAL
[25:51] continues. Pal should resign immediately
[25:53] if Congress is misled. So threats
[25:55] continue. uh he's already named his
[25:57] shadow fed or not named it but uh the
[26:00] two Kevins are are battling out in terms
[26:02] of Hasset and Worsh so he continues to
[26:04] make that then late on Friday uh I've
[26:07] mentioned uh PY uh uh the chairman of
[26:12] Franny and Freddy says he's encouraged
[26:14] by reports that Drone Pal is considering
[26:16] resigning. I think this will be the
[26:18] right decision for America. I don't know
[26:20] what's going to go on the housing
[26:21] market, but I do believe that there will
[26:23] be some kind of changes in things in the
[26:24] second half of the year along with rates
[26:26] and ways for people to get housing more
[26:28] affordable. That will again be another
[26:30] way for the economy. We are going to try
[26:32] and grow our way out of this. It is not
[26:33] about austerity. That is the big shift
[26:36] from the beginning. So if you go back to
[26:38] when momentum unwound in the first part
[26:39] of the year and you realize why did the
[26:41] mag 7 fall, the mag 7 fell because of
[26:43] deepsek it fell because the multiples
[26:45] were higher. Mag 7 is unchanged and they
[26:47] had blowout earnings uh growing at 30
[26:49] close to 30%. And yet that just means
[26:52] we've had multiple compression. There's
[26:54] nothing changing on the AI side. That
[26:56] was a huge mistake and a huge huge exit
[26:58] for people that fell behind. You're
[27:00] going to have AI stronger. You have the
[27:02] big beautiful bill in you have the rest
[27:04] of the world spending money. This is not
[27:06] the same way in China and the US
[27:08] actually have a trade deal. So you guys
[27:09] can all sit there and worry about the
[27:11] tariffs if you want. Uh, I would fade
[27:13] all of that and I'd use tariffs as an
[27:14] opportunity to put money to work in some
[27:16] of the trades related to the hardware
[27:18] and the embodiment side. Uh, again, BG2
[27:21] this week, uh, best podcast on
[27:23] technology, Michael Dell was on, worth
[27:25] the listen. Highly recommend it. You
[27:27] have to keep listening these to get more
[27:29] details on what's going on with AI.
[27:31] Doesn't see a bubble and thinks AI is
[27:32] way bigger tailwind than the internet.
[27:36] And then here are the details. AI will
[27:38] surpass the PC in internet in terms of
[27:40] productivity, affectctoring all
[27:41] knowledge workers in every industry.
[27:43] It's expansionary, not just
[27:44] deflationary. Companies already
[27:46] achieving 10 to 40% productivity gains.
[27:49] A 10 to 20% boost in global productivity
[27:51] would equate to 10 to 20 trillion in
[27:54] economic upside in service heavy
[27:57] sectors. Um, current AI investment is
[27:59] too small. It should be at least two to
[28:01] four trillion per year. Remember what I
[28:04] said, seven trillion by 2030. He's
[28:06] saying the number should be double that.
[28:08] Only 10% of large enterprises are
[28:09] capturing AI gains today. Those who fail
[28:12] to adapt will be disrupted by leaner,
[28:14] faster challengers. That goes for
[28:15] everyone watching this. Whatever your
[28:17] company is, especially if it's an asset
[28:18] management company. If you are still not
[28:20] allowed to use chatbt, quit tomorrow. Go
[28:23] get a job where you can use it or just
[28:24] go home and figure out how to use it.
[28:26] It's not just the companies that need to
[28:28] adapt. It's the individuals that need to
[28:30] get comfortable using it. If you're not
[28:31] allowed to use it, it is a it is a
[28:34] competitor of yours. do not make it a
[28:36] competitor. AI is already fueling a
[28:37] golden age of margin expansion. We've
[28:39] talked about that before. Demand for
[28:40] comput and tokens will explode.
[28:43] We are in the very early innings of the
[28:46] AI productivity cycle. That's because of
[28:48] the agentic move we're entering into
[28:50] now. I've had people reach out to me and
[28:52] say the AI agent stuff is not happening.
[28:54] You are absolutely wrong. It is
[28:56] happening. I have seen what people have
[28:58] been able to do with it. It's happening
[28:59] in our industry right now. If you fade
[29:02] AI agents and sit there and wait for it
[29:04] to be obvious, I know there's been
[29:05] people in the uh Silicon Valley world,
[29:08] particularly from OpenAI, that said it's
[29:09] not there. You have to be careful with
[29:11] what's going on. It is absolutely being
[29:13] used. It may not be being used the way
[29:15] people envision it two years from now,
[29:18] but is absolutely being used right now.
[29:20] Uh token usage is exploding as we go
[29:23] from basic queries to test time compute
[29:25] to deep reasoning to agents and multi-
[29:26] aents. The number of tokens just
[29:28] explodes. We've talked about that. Where
[29:30] do you want to go? the demand side, GPUs
[29:32] and AI servers, memory bandwidth. I've
[29:34] talked about Micron in here. Um, stock
[29:37] has doubled over the course of the last
[29:38] couple months, the network and data
[29:41] center expansion. We've talked about
[29:42] Oracle, we've talked about Cisco, all of
[29:44] these things. Basically, you've got a
[29:46] variety of places in there, but you also
[29:48] have the buildout side. Tokens are the
[29:50] electricity of the AI economy. AI
[29:54] agentic future will be powered by
[29:55] tokens. We are in the very early stages
[29:58] of the agentic world. We are still four
[30:00] or five years away from massive amounts
[30:02] of humanoids coming out, which means we
[30:06] have a very clear ramp over the next 5
[30:09] years. Don't get caught hearing people
[30:11] call this a bubble and overspending.
[30:13] This will not stop. You have government
[30:15] support and it's paid for free cash flow
[30:16] out of the biggest companies in the
[30:17] world that are worried about
[30:18] obsolescence so they can sell it to
[30:20] anyone. Um, token usage is the most
[30:23] scalable signal of AI adoption and
[30:24] intensity. So whenever you get that next
[30:26] report from cowen saying that they're
[30:28] fading uh Microsoft because the data
[30:30] leases are going down just remember
[30:32] token usage is the most scalable signal
[30:34] of a adoption intensity. So when Satcha
[30:36] Nadella says in the first quarter 100
[30:38] trillion tokens of which 50 trillion
[30:39] were in in March alone and then Sundar
[30:43] Pachai puts out a chart showing it 50
[30:45] times the usage of was a year ago. Just
[30:47] remember usage growth is an indicator of
[30:49] how fast AI is expanding. Now, Taiwan
[30:52] Semi reported AI related demand remains
[30:54] very strong, blah blah blah. Outpacing
[30:56] supply, go read this. To address the
[30:59] structural issues and long-term market
[31:00] demand, there's just no way to keep up.
[31:03] Okay, they haven't seen any changes in
[31:04] behavior so far. Uh, highlighted the
[31:07] exceptionally strong and sustained
[31:09] demand for AI and HPC chips. They expect
[31:12] AIdriven growth to continue dominating
[31:14] the semiconductor landscape through 2025
[31:16] and beyond with no signs of demand
[31:19] slowing or customer pullback. So what
[31:22] does that mean? Just start following
[31:25] this overlay. Oh, here's the
[31:26] construction for data centers. Here's
[31:28] the SMH. So when it fell down here, that
[31:31] was the bet that was happening that we
[31:34] weren't going to see the AI boom. This
[31:37] thing is going parabolic. You need more
[31:39] semis in your portfolio. They are not
[31:41] going to stop until we get further
[31:42] ahead. Uh Gro 4 was released has now
[31:45] taken over uh uh as the leading AI
[31:48] model. All that means is that you're
[31:50] going to have new model releases.
[31:51] Remember we are waiting for OpenAI to
[31:54] release this summer GPT5 which again is
[31:58] supposed to be a major major step in
[32:00] acceleration towards AGI. Uh Tesla
[32:03] expanding Austin robo taxi service. So
[32:05] we are getting more and more as Grock is
[32:07] being added into the cars. uh big news
[32:10] this week uh in terms of uh Isomorphic
[32:13] labs which is part of Google deep minds
[32:15] is about to start human trials for AI
[32:17] design cancer drugs. This is a very very
[32:19] big deal. Uh I suggest everyone uh start
[32:22] paying more attention to this uh because
[32:25] this will have implications in terms of
[32:27] speeding up what Deis Habis of Google
[32:30] Deep Mind has said which is since Alph
[32:32] Go in 2016 when they won that they
[32:35] shifted towards this with his goal being
[32:38] he wants all diseases that can be cured
[32:41] with drugs to be cured with drugs and
[32:44] they are starting to roll stuff out. So
[32:46] again longevity is a big part of the
[32:49] optimism that's going to happen going
[32:50] forward. I mentioned that this industry
[32:53] is going through a massive disruption
[32:55] now. So Alpha GBT uh GPT this was Mang
[32:59] Group put this out uh this week a new
[33:02] artificial intelligence system alpha GBT
[33:04] that can generate code and back test
[33:06] trading ideas. The system known as
[33:08] Agentic AI digs in for ideas blah blah
[33:10] you can read through it. I'm just saying
[33:12] it is hitting the industry now heavy.
[33:14] The agentic side allows for massive
[33:16] amounts of multiple works and streams
[33:19] being done by the computer. And of
[33:21] course, with everything going on, the
[33:22] most important news of the week, Bitcoin
[33:24] breaks out, makes new all-time highs
[33:26] above the highs that it made in May. Uh,
[33:29] and it was a strong week for it. All
[33:32] standard deviations right around one.
[33:34] So, V adjusted. It was a very stable
[33:37] move, but as I've said before, I see
[33:39] this reverse head and shoulders here on
[33:42] Ethereum. We had one false break and
[33:44] broke back below, but now we've gone
[33:45] higher again. I think this is the
[33:47] kickoff to the alt season in terms of
[33:50] seeing Ethereum uh outperform Bitcoin.
[33:52] Bitcoin dominance has been the major
[33:54] thing, but we're going to get a breath
[33:56] of the ecosystem. Micro strategy, I know
[33:59] the the bearish Michael Sailor, everyone
[34:01] writing stuff. It's very hard to find
[34:02] the macro people fading this as much. Um
[34:05] only Jim Chanos out there with his best
[34:07] idea being short this and get long
[34:08] Bitcoin. What a waste of time and money
[34:10] that is. Uh but for people that have
[34:13] been fading this as it hit 500 and came
[34:15] back down. Well, now Micro Strategy is
[34:17] approaching again
[34:19] uh all-time highs. Uh we'll see where it
[34:22] goes. You had all the technicians out. I
[34:24] I bring this up not because they're all
[34:26] seeing how this thing is about to break
[34:29] out. But we're at an important pivot
[34:32] point. Um not only is the government
[34:34] getting involved, the banks are allowed
[34:36] to talk about this stuff now. and you're
[34:37] getting more and more technicians that
[34:39] are bringing it out. Getting people to
[34:42] focus on this is a real asset. If you
[34:44] never talk about it on here, other than
[34:45] the the skepticism, now you're starting
[34:47] to talk about it from a technical
[34:49] analysis based at a time when retail's
[34:50] allowed to buy it. So, Rich Ross on pace
[34:53] to hit 170. Uh John Ro showed the big
[34:57] bases here, the breakout going on, what
[34:59] this typically does after the big
[35:02] breakout. So,
[35:04] they're calling for higher levels. You
[35:06] have this one looking at a reverse head
[35:09] and shoulders and iBit and talking about
[35:11] it to go to 83 which would equate to
[35:13] about 165 to 175. So everyone's got a
[35:17] 175 now on uh on the near term. John Rog
[35:20] even highlighted at 22V
[35:23] uh the move likely to target 4,000 to uh
[35:27] Ethereum. So that would be another 30%
[35:29] in Ethereum as well. Regardless of which
[35:32] one you're focused on, just remember uh
[35:35] I've talked about this all year as we've
[35:37] gone sideways. Liquidity has been
[35:40] booming. So the first thing you have to
[35:42] remember, Raul Pal, I did his uh his
[35:45] show this week um or last week. Uh
[35:48] global liquidity has been going up huge
[35:50] this year. It's been a very very big
[35:52] move. If people haven't realized, we
[35:54] started the year at around $80 trillion
[35:57] globally. We are now at 86 trillion. In
[36:00] 2020, we went from 55 trillion to about
[36:06] 65 trillion. So, we went up 10. We're on
[36:09] pace to do as much as we did in 2020. I
[36:11] I want you to hear that we're on pace
[36:14] for M2 around the globe to grow as much
[36:16] as it did in 2020. So, another reason,
[36:19] and you can see that how far above the
[36:21] 200 day moving average we are on this uh
[36:25] significantly above this is the 200
[36:27] week, sorry, but it's it's big. you're
[36:29] you've moved well above. Now, I put this
[36:32] out and I just want to make sure the
[36:33] reasons I like Bitcoin surprise. This is
[36:35] from the early June uh early June. These
[36:38] were all the things that were happening
[36:41] in terms of you know trust in the
[36:43] dollar, the capital stuff that's still a
[36:46] risk in terms of the bill um
[36:49] institutional adoption from the
[36:51] corporate treasuries which continues to
[36:52] go still have strategic reserve momentum
[36:55] from states and around the globe.
[36:57] Haven't seen in the US yet. inequalities
[36:59] from AI is going to continue. All of
[37:03] this stuff is still in play and still
[37:05] the reason rotation into utility tokens
[37:07] will revive market sentiment. That's
[37:08] what we're seeing right now with
[37:09] Ethereum. But the other thing is one of
[37:13] the most important charts for Bitcoin,
[37:15] the PMI. When the PMI is going higher,
[37:18] Bitcoin's going higher. The strongest
[37:19] moves that we have seen have been Here's
[37:22] the PMI. Here's the PMI. Here's the PMI.
[37:24] These are the biggest moves we've seen.
[37:26] So, with a PMI that's been down, we've
[37:28] been going higher. I can only imagine
[37:29] what's going to happen when we have the
[37:31] PMIs going up. It's been going up
[37:33] without it. So, these are just more This
[37:36] is actually doing some math on it and
[37:38] talking about the upside could be
[37:40] 240,000
[37:42] uh based on a PMI move uh of expansion.
[37:46] I think we could see the PMI even move
[37:48] higher than that. Um but regardless,
[37:50] let's just take that's what's happened
[37:52] historically. Uh Lyn Alden made a good
[37:55] point. tends to bottom here. So, the
[37:57] bottoms in Bitcoin tend to happen when
[37:59] we get the PMIs to go higher. This is
[38:01] back through 23. It does not include
[38:03] now. We were actually rallying into a
[38:05] weakening Bitcoin uh uh PMI. So, if we
[38:08] get a similar bump up in PMIs, which is
[38:10] what the green line uh highlights, uh
[38:13] you can imagine that you're going to see
[38:14] a similar move. The cycles are not this.
[38:16] Bitcoin is strongly correlated with
[38:18] things like the PMI. Cycles are
[38:20] necessary for the economy to work.
[38:21] Bitcoin is unique that it also interacts
[38:23] with the world. But there's a more
[38:25] important thing. Bitcoin goes up with
[38:27] global M2. All coins go up and down with
[38:29] the business cycle. So, one of the
[38:31] things that has been negative
[38:34] has been Ethereum versus Bitcoin and
[38:37] it's been correlated right here to the
[38:40] PMI chart. So, if the PMI chart is going
[38:42] up, you get an expansion in the
[38:43] ecosystem. Um, slowly building our way
[38:46] to the perfect alt season once again.
[38:48] Uh, we'll see what happens, but it feels
[38:50] like that to me. Tom Lee who's now in
[38:53] the Ethereum uh treasury strategy
[38:57] uh recently uh this was a great quote
[38:59] and I think it's there. I do believe the
[39:01] circle IPO will be looked back as a chat
[39:04] GPT moment. Now without going through
[39:06] this as to why
[39:10] I have got more calls and more people
[39:12] reaching out and they're not just
[39:14] looking at Bitcoin now they're asking
[39:16] about Ethereum tokenization is real.
[39:19] Everyone is now starting to realize that
[39:22] with Circle, what actually happened?
[39:24] This isn't just some, you know, game.
[39:27] Now, what does Circle mean? Why are
[39:30] stable coins worth so much money? So,
[39:32] they're starting to do the homework.
[39:33] Homework on the hedge fund side,
[39:34] homework on the bank side. You're going
[39:36] to see more research because remember,
[39:37] the government is allowing the banks to
[39:39] be involved. As they get more involved,
[39:41] there'll be more positive stories on it.
[39:42] As there's more positive stories, people
[39:44] will read it. It gives more credibility.
[39:46] This is the network effects that I
[39:48] thought would happen. Tokenization a
[39:50] major thing. Here's the Robin Hood CEO
[39:53] has been all over the map over the
[39:54] course of the last two weeks. Uh first
[39:57] at cons and now again talking tokenized
[39:59] equities with regulators. I believe
[40:01] tokenization is the greatest capital
[40:02] markets innovation since the central
[40:04] limit order book. I've talked about it
[40:06] before. The digital capital structure of
[40:08] the world is changing. Last week's title
[40:10] on the video was about um Venod Kasa's
[40:15] call which I happen to agree with that
[40:17] the 2030s will be a massive disruption
[40:20] to all public companies but in
[40:23] particular the public companies built on
[40:25] code which are the highest waitings.
[40:28] This tokenization is part of the digital
[40:30] capital change that is happening in all
[40:32] of our lives and the reason that you
[40:33] should get involved. I'm going to put
[40:35] this up again. If you need to go find
[40:38] more detail on Ethereum, go read this
[40:41] the digital oil, which means as activity
[40:45] is growing, you want to understand the
[40:47] importance of the plat the the ETH
[40:50] platform, Sooie, Salana, go through the
[40:53] whole thing. Go spend your time on
[40:55] BitTenzer for all of the AI uh side from
[40:59] the agentic side. Just go learn more
[41:01] about what is coming. Uh, for those of
[41:03] you who didn't see it, Rick Edelman, who
[41:06] founded a $300 billion investment
[41:09] advisory one, I think this is so right
[41:12] and I think it's happening. Owning
[41:13] crypto is no longer speculative
[41:14] position. Failing to do so is recommends
[41:17] 40% crypto allocation for aggressive
[41:19] investors. He has talked about the fact
[41:21] that people are going to live longer,
[41:23] which means they need to extend the
[41:25] duration of investments
[41:28] uh risk investments they have. Their
[41:30] risk allocation must go up. This is not
[41:32] just about crypto. This is about the
[41:34] story I showed about isomorphic labs.
[41:37] People will be living longer lives and
[41:39] we are at the inflection point for that.
[41:41] You need to have more duration, less
[41:43] bonds, more risk assets. Crypto is where
[41:46] you need to tell your financial advisor
[41:48] to understand it more so you can at
[41:50] least start talking about whether you
[41:51] guys want to make an allocation, but
[41:53] start paying attention more and more
[41:55] because it is leading the way higher.
[41:57] And if there was uh no other reason than
[41:59] to pay attention this week,
[42:02] US director of digital assets said
[42:03] there's a huge week ahead. Time to make
[42:05] America the crypto capital of the world.
[42:07] It's a big week for crypto. It's a big
[42:09] week for the PMI. It's a big week for
[42:12] people to fall for the tariff fears
[42:14] again. Have a great week, guys. I'll see
[42:16] you next week.
