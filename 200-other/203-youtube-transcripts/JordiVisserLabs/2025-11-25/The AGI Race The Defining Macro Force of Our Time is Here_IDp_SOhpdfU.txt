--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] week and finally we get some uh
[00:02] weakness. Uh August starts off with a
[00:05] pullback, some bad economic data,
[00:08] tariffs continue, earnings were strong.
[00:12] Still a lot of stuff going on. Let's
[00:13] just get right to it.
[00:23] All right. Well, so the S&P was up three
[00:27] months in a row. Uh so we were due for a
[00:30] pullback. Uh should not be surprising at
[00:33] the same point that we saw the S&P
[00:35] pullback after three straight up months.
[00:38] Uh I continue to say that the trade for
[00:41] people getting focused on at this point
[00:44] non-equities especially on the rate
[00:46] side. Uh this has just been a death
[00:48] trade now for really the better part of
[00:50] the last three years or two and a half
[00:52] at this point or almost three. uh you're
[00:55] just getting back and forths on tenure
[00:56] rates while we sit around this, you
[00:58] know, four and a quarter area. Uh I'm
[01:01] sure that'll change at some point, but I
[01:03] just don't think uh it's the trade. Uh
[01:06] the dollar saw a huge move in July and
[01:11] uh you know, we've reversed a little bit
[01:14] uh on Friday on the back of the weaker
[01:16] data, but for the most part, the dollar
[01:17] still looks like it's in a uh a counter
[01:20] trend move at this point. uh until we
[01:23] get more confirmation that the Fed may
[01:25] cut rates uh and that the economy is
[01:27] okay. Uh I posted this on uh on Tuesday.
[01:33] Uh I keep a this white line here is what
[01:38] I call a spec basket. This basically
[01:40] contains all the areas of the market
[01:42] that I do not think are uh are ready for
[01:45] prime time yet. things like quantum uh
[01:48] it's all the the high beta names that
[01:50] are with inside these areas and it
[01:53] really fits in with retail which has had
[01:55] a dominant part. So this is not
[01:56] something in the past that I would have
[01:58] focused on but because retail's had such
[02:00] a big part of the turns uh I think
[02:02] following the spec basket actually
[02:04] matters a lot. It definitely does for
[02:06] crypto as well. So you can see it led
[02:08] the move lower here and I posted this
[02:11] because we had this is the NASDAQ. We
[02:13] had been above the 20 moving average for
[02:15] I think the longest time since the
[02:17] 1980s. Uh so we were due for a pullback.
[02:20] We were due for the NDX to get under
[02:22] 20day. So I posted this on Tuesday
[02:24] basically saying we were seeing the spec
[02:26] names already leading. I think that's
[02:28] what people should be looking at uh
[02:30] whenever we've had these kind of big
[02:32] moves. And on the dollar uh Goldman
[02:34] posted this. I mean the dollar overall
[02:37] dollar is going to weaken trend which
[02:38] I'm part of that camp too. But uh
[02:41] currencies weaken and strengthen
[02:43] especially when it comes to the dollar.
[02:44] This is a long-term view to me. Uh this
[02:47] is not a short-term thing. In fact, a
[02:49] lot of it from my perspective has to do
[02:50] with the democratization of AI and not
[02:53] what everyone else is seeing. The
[02:54] democratization of AI should allow other
[02:56] countries to benefit. But I also believe
[02:58] that we're entering the hardware side.
[03:00] So, uh the dollar when people get caught
[03:03] into the US is going to default or
[03:04] anything along those lines uh with rates
[03:06] moving higher. I just don't see it as as
[03:09] uh as something to focus on. In terms of
[03:11] a level for the S&P, we did break the
[03:13] 20-day here. You can see in the S&P, we
[03:16] also had been above it all this time
[03:18] period. And then we had gotten below
[03:19] here, but closed back above it. We broke
[03:22] it. Uh I think we needs to do some do
[03:25] some work here between the 50-day, which
[03:26] is also the prior highs around the 6130
[03:29] area and 6,400. Uh I think that makes
[03:33] sense. Uh I still think the market is
[03:35] going to end up trading higher into the
[03:37] end of the year. Uh but I think for the
[03:39] time being, especially for the next few
[03:41] weeks, which are seasonally bad, but
[03:43] also because we've had such a long run,
[03:45] people need to remember that uh we need
[03:47] to consolidate things. I don't think
[03:50] this is turning into something uh
[03:51] negative. But there were reasons that
[03:54] people were worried on Friday.
[03:57] This is the uh two-month revision chart.
[04:00] So minus 258,000.
[04:03] This is going back 12 years. That's how
[04:05] much data we have. Uh only one time
[04:08] basically in the worst of COVID when we
[04:11] were losing when a millions of people
[04:13] were being laid off. We haven't seen
[04:14] anything like this. So the revision was
[04:16] massively negative down 258. That
[04:19] started the point of getting people
[04:21] negative. We had the PMI which I'm
[04:23] focused on obviously for the second half
[04:25] of the year uh came in below the lowest
[04:28] estimate. Uh so we had a miss on the
[04:30] PMI. Then we also had house prices down
[04:34] month over month for the third month in
[04:36] a row. Uh and then finally Friday
[04:39] brought back tariffs. So everyone
[04:41] started to combine everything together.
[04:43] We end up getting uh a sell-off. Uh when
[04:46] you go through the payroll numbers, I
[04:48] think it's important because uh there's
[04:50] clearly a story going on here and I'
[04:52] I've shown this before, but these are
[04:53] the monthly totals uh going back to
[04:56] April of 24. And what you can see is now
[04:59] with those revisions, the last three
[05:00] months are basically at just over
[05:02] 100,000. So somewhere around 30,000 uh a
[05:05] month, 35,000 a month. And then you can
[05:08] see how far it's dropped off really
[05:10] since the inauguration. So we had
[05:13] already moved down to the hundreds. Uh
[05:16] you had been higher than that,
[05:18] especially leading into the election. Uh
[05:20] but you had these kind of negative
[05:22] numbers. And what I really want to
[05:23] highlight is what I've said before. uh
[05:25] 191473
[05:28] if you basically take this line out
[05:30] which again is all health care services.
[05:33] It says education and health care but
[05:34] really over we've seen the education
[05:36] side actually go negative. Uh this is
[05:38] all health care services. So without
[05:40] health care services we'd already be at
[05:42] negative jobs right now. Um just
[05:44] important to keep in mind because we do
[05:47] have a weak jobs market. There's no way
[05:48] around it. This is the jobs market X two
[05:52] parts uh the healthcare and education
[05:54] services but also the leisure which
[05:56] think of as travel. Um it's this a
[05:59] five-month average. So we've had
[06:01] negative 13,000. You got to go all the
[06:03] way back to the recession periods to
[06:06] find anything this way. So underneath
[06:08] the hood when you strip out health care
[06:10] and education you have an economy which
[06:12] is just not that strong from a jobs
[06:14] perspective. This is the diffusion index
[06:16] which takes another way of looking at
[06:18] it. This is the 3month diffusion index
[06:20] which is posted backtoback months now
[06:22] under 50. Uh again that means less than
[06:25] 50% of the industries uh in the US are
[06:29] creating positive jobs. Historically
[06:31] that's been a recession time. That being
[06:33] said uh when you look at the aggregate
[06:36] so everyone focused on the payroll
[06:37] numbers which again you're going to have
[06:39] two things that are happening. one is
[06:41] AI, the other one is that immigration uh
[06:43] has been reversed and so the population
[06:46] growth is not there and we have a labor
[06:47] shortage. So with the demographics,
[06:50] you're going to have more people rolling
[06:51] off every single month which is going to
[06:53] take down the payroll numbers. So I
[06:55] expected, as I've talked about for
[06:57] really the last few months, less than
[06:58] 100,000 for the second half of the year,
[07:00] probably closer to 50,000. We're below
[07:02] that right now. I do think we'll see a
[07:04] little bit of a bump uh from some of the
[07:06] PMI areas, but we still have the issue
[07:09] with no hiring. So what this is is the
[07:11] aggregate. I've shown this before. The
[07:13] aggregate number was actually very good.
[07:15] So when you look at the last three
[07:16] months, you got one little negative, you
[07:18] got positive. But remember this takes
[07:19] into account not just the number of
[07:21] people hired. But if you if you're not
[07:23] hiring as many people and you're putting
[07:26] more hours on and you're paying them
[07:27] more money, then you end up with an
[07:29] aggregate number that's still okay. And
[07:31] when you look at the three-month average
[07:32] for the aggregate, it's still completely
[07:35] fine. So, the jobs picture is about not
[07:38] hiring people. Um, the claims shows the
[07:41] exact same thing. We had a runup in
[07:42] claims. I showed this. I showed all the
[07:44] kind of warning notices, stuff that were
[07:46] up here. But since June, everything's
[07:49] come back down. Um, and the claims data
[07:51] is basically sitting near the lows. So,
[07:53] this is about a problem not with firing
[07:56] people, it's a problem with hiring
[07:58] people. In terms of the tariffs, you get
[08:00] these stories and I just want to
[08:01] emphasize this point as to when people
[08:04] see these stories. Ford warns a profit
[08:06] with two billion tariff two billion
[08:09] dollar tariff sounds like a big number.
[08:11] Whirlpool stock tumbles. The combined
[08:13] market cap of these two companies
[08:15] Whirlpool and Ford old economy things
[08:18] related to housing and related to autos
[08:20] which historically drove the economy and
[08:22] certainly drove the PMI which every
[08:24] single economist puts a lot of stock in.
[08:27] This is an AI trade. This is not about
[08:29] these companies. The total market cap of
[08:31] these combined is about 50 trillion.
[08:35] I bring that up because here are the
[08:37] earnings uh or the revenue numbers for
[08:39] Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta,
[08:42] Microsoft. You see down here we've got
[08:45] 81 billion versus an expected 79. If you
[08:48] take the differential of all three of
[08:50] all five, those companies beat estimates
[08:53] by $18 billion
[08:56] uh about a bigger than a third of the
[08:59] market cap of those two stocks. Those
[09:00] stocks don't matter um for the S&P 500.
[09:03] these companies do. And that's why when
[09:06] Meta and Microsoft beat two
[09:07] multi-trillion dollar companies moving
[09:09] 400 billion after hours, both companies
[09:11] beating revenue by three billion or
[09:12] more, the analysts thought they
[09:14] understood how fast this world was
[09:15] moving. But Meta Microsoft basically
[09:17] told the world that we have no clue and
[09:19] about how serious the shift to AI in
[09:21] this new economy is. And I will continue
[09:23] to say it. The only thing that matters
[09:26] on the macro side is artificial
[09:28] intelligence. And in particular, you
[09:29] have to look at this stage at the
[09:31] earnings side. We had the buildout which
[09:33] was all about Nvidian compute. Now we're
[09:36] getting into two new components. The
[09:38] buildout for energy and the acceleration
[09:40] on the data center because of the
[09:41] re-industrialization,
[09:43] but also the adoption side. As more and
[09:46] more companies use AI, you start to see
[09:49] these companies beat because there was
[09:52] still more demand than we have supply
[09:53] for the moment in the massive cloud
[09:55] computing segment. That was from Amazon.
[09:57] We continue to see exceptionally strong
[09:58] demand from enterprise for cloud and AI
[10:01] services and demand is ahead of our
[10:02] available supply in several key regions.
[10:05] We are accelerating our data center and
[10:07] build down and GPA procurement to meet
[10:09] the supply.
[10:11] Constraints on high-end AI
[10:12] infrastructure expected to persist in
[10:14] the next several quarters that was from
[10:16] Microsoft. And then Sundar Pachchai AI
[10:18] related demand for cloud infrastructure
[10:20] continues to outstrip supply.
[10:24] Basically, no matter how many times
[10:26] you're going to look at this, the
[10:28] adoption phase is happening at the
[10:29] company level. As they use more AI, they
[10:32] need more cloud. As we have more AI
[10:35] agents, the numbers go up exponentially.
[10:37] This is what's coming. So these numbers
[10:39] on the adoption side are going to lead
[10:42] to more revenues for these guys. At the
[10:44] same time, more profit margins for those
[10:46] companies because they need less hiring.
[10:48] The buildout's coming. You can just go
[10:50] through this from the economic basis.
[10:52] This is why companies like Ford and
[10:53] Whirlpool have nothing to do with the US
[10:55] economy in terms of growth. They matter
[10:58] for some jobs. They matter for the
[11:00] housing market. Things that are not part
[11:02] of the digital world. And this is why
[11:04] people have to make the transition. In
[11:06] terms of one of the statements from
[11:07] Microsoft there, we have 368 billion of
[11:11] contracted backlog we need to deliver
[11:14] not just across Azure but across the
[11:16] breath of the Microsoft cloud. 368
[11:19] billion of contracted backlog. You're
[11:21] going to see a lot of backlog from me in
[11:24] terms of this uh uh this presentation
[11:26] today. Uh remember Microsoft Cowan came
[11:30] out and said put all these data center
[11:32] fears. uh Andrew Ross sarking but oh
[11:35] yeah I'm good for my 80 billion that
[11:37] says he's now good for 120 billion
[11:39] basically all the hyperscalers in some
[11:41] way took up their their their dollar
[11:43] spend uh American electric power boost
[11:46] this a utility you have to spend time on
[11:48] this company utilities are not going to
[11:50] trade like utilities these are not
[11:52] boring companies they are saying setting
[11:54] long-term contracts they are bidding
[11:57] from pricing power AAP boost fullear
[11:59] outlook as data center boom fuels
[12:01] operating earnings
[12:05] unprecedented loan growth. They reported
[12:07] an expected 24 gawatts of new customer
[12:09] load by 2030. Most of it backed by
[12:11] signed customer financial commitments
[12:14] that insulate AOP and our customers from
[12:16] salesdriven earnings volatility. Again,
[12:18] energy companies, I don't care if it's
[12:20] utility, they've been cyclical in the
[12:21] past. There's no recession coming up
[12:23] from AI. This is a substantial jump from
[12:25] 21 gig forecasted earlier in the year.
[12:28] So, you've got a 15% increase on their
[12:30] numbers on that commercial load driven
[12:32] by growth in energy intensive
[12:34] subsectors.
[12:36] AAP is raising its five-year capital
[12:38] investment plan. They don't get included
[12:40] in this stuff. 70 billion from 54
[12:42] billion prior, citing data centers and
[12:45] AI backlo AI infrastructure. And again,
[12:47] record backlog of requests. The company
[12:49] has over
[12:51] 190 gigawatts of addent of additional
[12:53] load requests currently under study
[12:57] 190 gawatt. It's massive.
[13:01] Verdive reported they've been one of the
[13:02] darlings in this uh another earnings
[13:04] report. Unprecedented data send growth
[13:08] uh tethered to the hyperscalers driven
[13:10] by AI buildouts. company reported record
[13:13] backlog and a raised booktoill ratios
[13:15] signaling persistent and growing AI
[13:18] center demand fueling future results.
[13:21] Schneider Electric data center market
[13:24] seen as exceptionally strong on the call
[13:26] executives acknowledged that the pan
[13:28] center clients is at times outstripping
[13:32] Schneider's current supply capacity
[13:33] especially for highdensity modular and
[13:35] liquid cooling systems accelerating
[13:37] investments uh capacity. They're hoping
[13:41] to catch up with orders. It's not just
[13:42] in North America, it's in Asia. We are
[13:45] seeing underlying demand for our data
[13:46] center solutions grow faster than any
[13:48] time in our history. Customer
[13:51] requirements for power and cooling,
[13:52] particularly driven by AR, challenging
[13:53] the industry's ability to deliver
[13:55] capacity quickly. A record backlog and a
[13:57] historic order book. Again, these are
[14:00] different companies. They're in
[14:01] different parts of it. Here's another
[14:04] one. This is Celestica emphasizes
[14:07] expanding portfolio
[14:09] especially networking servers robust
[14:11] demand from leading technology companies
[14:14] uh major long-term secular you can see
[14:17] the things are involved in here in terms
[14:19] of power management systems this is a
[14:21] network company then you got Hubble uh
[14:24] again another industrial the growth in
[14:26] data centers was supported by solid
[14:27] demand from key vertical markets
[14:30] uh Hubble emphasized that the ongoing AI
[14:33] boom and grid modernization are
[14:34] strategic macro tailwinds supporting
[14:37] short-term and long-term growth in its
[14:38] solutions portfolio.
[14:42] Comfort Systems Fix
[14:45] uh backlog hit a record 8.1 billion
[14:48] stock was up huge uh uh after the
[14:52] earnings Panasonic battery I'm not going
[14:54] to read you this one but just know that
[14:56] this is going on in the battery and
[14:58] storage side as well API group which um
[15:02] again not not one you'd basically be
[15:04] seeing on this but we continue to see
[15:05] demand for missionritical building and
[15:07] safety services outpace expectations.
[15:11] Uh so this is on the safety and
[15:14] specialty services. They have a backlog
[15:16] in that area as well. And then we're
[15:19] starting to get to an important area.
[15:21] This was uh one of the first uh
[15:23] transport companies that mentioned it.
[15:25] Uh it's starting to show up. Segments
[15:27] benefit from specialized freight such as
[15:28] heavy hall construction materials and
[15:31] data center equipment that command
[15:33] higher margins are less cyclical than
[15:35] dry van. uh it's starting to show up in
[15:39] this and again I think people have to
[15:41] pay attention that as the shipments of
[15:43] construction materials equipment and
[15:45] modules for hypers scale and AIdriven
[15:46] projects these specialized and heavy
[15:48] hall moves command premium pricing
[15:50] you're only starting to see the stuff
[15:53] that to me would be the PMI side I don't
[15:55] expect the PMI to show the big move
[15:57] until we get at least a couple more
[15:58] months out the time period that I'm
[16:00] comparing this to is most closely is
[16:02] actually in the 03 period from 2000 to
[16:06] 2003 because of the overbuild in tech
[16:08] and the dot bubble. We had a PMI that
[16:10] for the most part averaged below 50
[16:13] during that three-year period. Uh I
[16:15] remember trading in 03. I started my
[16:17] hedge fund and my hedge fund in 03. And
[16:20] I just remember people were very very
[16:21] bearish on the economy. Rates were
[16:23] sitting at lower levels. Then all of a
[16:25] sudden we had a PMI print that missed in
[16:28] May. Then it beat slightly in June and
[16:30] then it beat big in July. And that
[16:32] started a a a fairly big change. uh in
[16:36] everything and then the PMI stayed
[16:37] basically from 2003 to 2007 above 50 uh
[16:41] in terms of the PE ratio because if
[16:43] anything shows up on X most people are
[16:45] talking about valuations again I've
[16:47] talked about this before but whenever I
[16:49] see another person that puts this out
[16:51] there this one is from Duality Research
[16:53] here's the profit margin chart we are
[16:55] entering a period where profit margins
[16:57] are going to get better from AI it's
[16:59] going to happen you're going to have to
[17:01] go through this and as profit margins
[17:02] get better the valuation deserves to be
[17:04] at a higher level. That's what they're
[17:06] saying. So, they've created an adjusted
[17:08] uh valuation based on profit margins.
[17:10] This is not something that just picks
[17:12] something random. If profit margins were
[17:13] to come down, then the market should
[17:15] come down. But if profit margins stay at
[17:16] high levels, it should be a big thing
[17:19] for uh valuations. Mike Wilson who's had
[17:21] a good call this month um did get
[17:24] bullish down around the 5,000 area uh
[17:27] after the correction uh and talked about
[17:30] the fact that the earnings look good and
[17:31] basically highlights something important
[17:33] uh that I think is worth putting in
[17:35] here. He's talking about the fact that
[17:37] more resilient earnings cash flow
[17:39] backdrop than previously expected and
[17:41] improvement driven in part by AI
[17:43] adoption. We talked about the weakness
[17:45] in the dollar even though it
[17:46] strengthened uh over the course of the
[17:48] last two weeks. It has been weaker
[17:50] significantly by the year. In fact, the
[17:52] biggest weak uh the worst first half of
[17:55] year uh in history in the dollar. You're
[17:57] getting the cash tax savings from the
[17:59] one big beautiful bill and pent-up
[18:01] demand for many sectors uh in the market
[18:03] that have kind of been on hold because
[18:04] of fears over the tariffs where at a
[18:06] minimum we're way past the uncertainty
[18:08] point. We now have peak certainty uh in
[18:10] my opinion. Uh and he goes through we're
[18:12] already seeing earnings revision breath
[18:14] has improved considerably. I've shown
[18:16] that uh and he talks about a lot of
[18:18] different things, but I think the AI
[18:20] adoption is a is a big thing. And then
[18:22] one more thing for people to remember is
[18:23] the high probability of more Fed rate
[18:25] cuts in the first quarter. That's why
[18:27] the numbers on Friday that were on the
[18:29] weaker side for people that want to look
[18:31] for the ne next bullish catalyst.
[18:33] Cutting earnings into a PMI cycle that
[18:36] bottoms and goes higher is going to be
[18:38] very very bullish if that's what plays
[18:40] out. And I think it is. And the reason I
[18:41] think it's going to play out is because
[18:43] of this. So I want to emphasize as I go
[18:45] through these charts on the data center
[18:47] buildout that if you haven't taken the
[18:48] time to realize how much is now ongoing
[18:51] now uh it's exploding. So we've had data
[18:55] center growth. This chart here the
[18:57] yellow things are the operating uh data
[18:59] center infrastructures. These orange
[19:01] ones which are popping up all over the
[19:03] country not just in any one area but
[19:05] across the country. Those are the under
[19:07] construction ones. And then you have the
[19:09] white ones all over the place here,
[19:11] which are the proposed ones. We have
[19:13] more proposed than we have anything. And
[19:16] here's what you got. New Jersey, massive
[19:18] data center. Nevada, massive data
[19:20] center. Texas, massive data center.
[19:22] These are all
[19:24] reports from this week. So these are all
[19:27] in the final eight days of of July. This
[19:30] one is in Wyoming, the air boom that
[19:32] could outpower outpower an entire state.
[19:35] Virginia was already a major place. uh
[19:37] they're talking about the impact it's
[19:38] having on logistics and then you can see
[19:40] this massive structure here which is in
[19:43] Arizona uh and this is on plans to build
[19:46] the biggest project
[19:49] San Jose San Jose has forged powerful
[19:51] lines to strengthen the city's
[19:52] electrical and meet the soaring energy
[19:54] needs uh partnership includes
[19:58] with projections of nearly 200,000 new
[20:00] jobs primarily in construction we have
[20:02] labor shortages with inside the
[20:04] construction and energy place I'll talk
[20:05] more about this open AI launches
[20:07] Stargate in Europe. European data center
[20:10] power demand to double by 2030. This is
[20:12] not just a US thing. So you should see
[20:14] growth around the globe from data
[20:16] centers including Asia. An interesting
[20:18] comment from a former meta employee.
[20:20] Energy is the biggest bottleneck right
[20:22] now. If we look at any of the
[20:24] transformers or any of the power
[20:25] equipment or cooling equipment or even
[20:27] the construction or availability of
[20:28] power, there is no way it's going to
[20:30] happen. Meaning the spend on the capex.
[20:32] If you talk about Schneider, who
[20:33] supplies a lot of power equipment, I
[20:35] showed their earnings. They're
[20:36] completely full with a back order until
[20:38] 2030. They're not negotiating on price.
[20:40] It's basically you're lucky to get an
[20:41] order. Everyone talks about Nvidia, but
[20:43] there are many other things beyond
[20:44] Nvidia for this thing. If you even if
[20:47] you have the money, you can't spend it.
[20:48] This is going to become a story about
[20:51] energy and about power. So, I continue
[20:53] to say it. Factories are the new power
[20:55] users. So, you're getting into this
[20:57] construction, manufacturing. Again, this
[21:01] is becoming the big thing that is going
[21:03] to explode.
[21:05] Who pays AI boom sparks fight over
[21:07] soaring power costs? Again, when I do
[21:09] these things, I'm picking stories from
[21:10] the week. Utilities and technology
[21:12] companies at odds over who should pay
[21:13] for the electricity costs. Hm. I wonder
[21:16] who Trump is going to make pay for this
[21:17] when it comes down to it. I don't think
[21:18] the consumer is going to pay for it. I
[21:20] think the hypers scal scalers will find
[21:22] a way for them to have to pay for it. uh
[21:25] just stories across the country about
[21:27] the power needs and about the rising
[21:29] electricity prices. And now you're
[21:31] finally starting to see at least story
[21:34] show up on an element that I think is
[21:36] important. If we get to the point where
[21:38] oil, I had someone reach out to me and
[21:40] say, "Well, oil is not going higher. How
[21:42] can there be a power situation?" We now
[21:43] have Brent solidly above $70. Uh we have
[21:48] WTI right around $70. This is all
[21:51] despite the fact that the energy price
[21:53] is higher. We've had production
[21:55] increases from uh OPEC, OPEC plus. We've
[21:58] had obviously uh a spike that happened
[22:01] on the back of Israel going into Iran.
[22:03] It fell down, but it stayed above the
[22:06] price that we were before it started. So
[22:08] you're starting to get this, but I think
[22:10] this is an important thing because as
[22:11] commodity prices and in particular
[22:14] certain things go higher on the tariff
[22:15] side, it's very very difficult for
[22:19] energy production in the US to continue
[22:22] because if you've got rising labor
[22:26] demand that's coming from shortages in
[22:28] labor for construction and you're
[22:30] looking for labor in this part, you've
[22:32] got a problem where the cost of steel,
[22:34] labor, and frack materials in part due
[22:37] to tariffs become an issue. So you can
[22:40] control some of the tariff prices at
[22:42] some point, but in terms of it driving
[22:44] up oil and the key power side, it's
[22:47] going to fit into it if all that stuff
[22:49] has got it. So just remember as this
[22:51] plays out, it's still very early in
[22:53] this. I think it's going to take for
[22:55] building this stuff, the ordering of it.
[22:57] We have just gotten out of the
[22:58] uncertainty over the tariffs and the one
[23:01] big beautiful bill. Now they're in there
[23:04] and the White House has done the AI
[23:06] action plan to basically per get rid of
[23:09] permitting. Deregulation is going to be
[23:11] a major driver. When I've talked about
[23:12] with PE with clients on this for 22V and
[23:15] I've done presentations, this reminds me
[23:17] a lot of the way Trump did the fast
[23:19] track on the vaccine. When you take out
[23:22] deregulation for something this massive
[23:24] and important to the group where we need
[23:26] power, we need AI, I would expect that
[23:29] this is going to be a major push. We
[23:30] also have the rare earth problem. There
[23:32] was a meeting at the White House this
[23:33] week and I showed this last week. The
[23:35] mining side is going to be important. At
[23:37] the same point, this is starting to
[23:39] become something. We still don't have a
[23:40] trade deal with China and I've said that
[23:42] I think the trade war with China is
[23:44] over, but now we're starting to get into
[23:46] something that I think could be a little
[23:47] bit more important. So Besson says we're
[23:49] on the cusp of trade deal. I watched
[23:51] this YouTube with BG2 with Brad
[23:54] Gersonner who's been very very good this
[23:57] year and I don't know how much of his
[23:58] knowledge on the right time for things.
[24:00] He kind of got the the turning point on
[24:02] the tariffs right. Uh he seems to be
[24:04] heavily involved uh with the White House
[24:08] to some degree whether that's from
[24:10] information coming from the tech people
[24:12] that that are there or it's because he
[24:14] was involved in the thousand investment
[24:16] uh portion that they were doing for
[24:18] kids. But he said on this podcast, I
[24:21] think this president wants to do the
[24:23] biggest deal ever done with China.
[24:24] Besson's been very clear. China has to
[24:26] rebalance to domestic consumption and
[24:28] away from an export economy. I think
[24:30] this is important because a big deal
[24:31] with China, even if it's only for the
[24:33] next four years, uh will involve
[24:36] something in my opinion on China that
[24:38] they have to focus on. I I think they're
[24:40] feeling the pressure from the export
[24:42] side and they continue to talk about
[24:44] needing to step up economic policy
[24:46] support and even though everyone in the
[24:48] US continues to uh
[24:52] I guess fade it is the best word to use.
[24:54] I don't see how the country doesn't do
[24:57] enough to continue to grow near 5% and
[25:00] continue to air on the side of growing a
[25:01] little bit faster. but also the AI race
[25:04] and the need for knowing that the US is
[25:06] racing faster on AI and on crypto is
[25:09] forcing China to get involved. Again,
[25:11] she is very much tied right now to
[25:15] China's economy. So, he needs to get
[25:17] this going. Um, how I how China is
[25:20] gerting for an AI battle with the US.
[25:22] China's ramping up its efforts to build
[25:24] a domestic AI ecosystem that can
[25:26] function without Western technology.
[25:28] Again, I bring that up because neither
[25:31] country wants to fall backwards uh in
[25:33] terms of the tariffs. Just keep paying
[25:35] attention. I still think this White
[25:36] House is doing everything that they
[25:37] possibly can to help Americans that are
[25:40] in uh in the position of fighting off
[25:43] inflation, dealing with housing
[25:45] affordability. I still think there's
[25:47] measures to come. Rebate checks, just
[25:49] another thing to keep on the back of
[25:50] your mind that I think they're
[25:52] emphasizing growth. Uh back to the Fed
[25:54] this week. uh they kept things on hold,
[25:57] but there were two Fed officials that
[25:58] dissented. That wasn't all the story for
[26:00] the week. Historically, dissensions uh
[26:04] are positive. Uh they often, as uh this
[26:07] uh was put in, uh governors often lead
[26:09] policy moves. Uh so again, I wouldn't
[26:12] treat it as a nothing. I think the
[26:14] market still expects the Fed to go. And
[26:16] I think after the data we saw this week,
[26:18] uh we've put the September probability
[26:20] up above 85% as of late Friday. Uh, this
[26:24] didn't stop Trump. Jerome Tle, pal,
[26:26] stubborn And then, of course,
[26:28] after the jobs number, I've directed my
[26:31] team to fire this Biden political
[26:32] appointee immediately. So, the the jobs
[26:35] number thing, Trump is not going to stop
[26:38] until he has the economy booming. The
[26:40] economy is booming under Trump despite a
[26:42] Fed that also plays games. I just think
[26:44] this Fed story in terms of cutting rates
[26:47] at a at the same time that I think
[26:48] there's a delay and we're going to see
[26:50] the increase coming up with PMIs at the
[26:52] same time that the stock market's near
[26:54] all-time highs. And you guys remember
[26:55] what happens if you cut rates and you
[26:57] don't get a recession, it is bullish.
[26:59] We've now been on hold, you'll start
[27:01] seeing things saying if you're on hold
[27:03] and then you cut rates again and you
[27:04] don't go into a recession, it's a big
[27:05] deal. We did have a Fed governor uh
[27:09] resign on Friday uh and she was in the
[27:12] hawkish camp. So, we're
[27:16] losing someone who was at least
[27:18] according to that person on the hawkish
[27:20] side. Uh best podcast to watch this week
[27:24] again was Moonshots. Moonshots has been
[27:26] a go-to uh because they've been doing
[27:28] such big broad topics combining AI with
[27:31] the economy and this one was no
[27:33] exception. and they spent a lot of time
[27:35] on the AI plan. The panel describes
[27:37] President Trump's action plan as an
[27:39] unprecedented in size and ambition
[27:41] effectively positioning the US on a war
[27:43] footing in the global AI race. I want to
[27:45] remind people this is not in any way a
[27:48] political uh podcast. This is 100% with
[27:51] MIT people. All of the people that were
[27:53] on this episode, Alex Gross, Peter
[27:55] Diamandis, David Blondon, they're all
[27:58] MIT graduates. These are all people
[28:01] focused solely on what's happening in
[28:02] technology. All of them are heavily
[28:04] involved and invested in the AI space.
[28:07] Uh it's a global AI rise. It's not just
[28:09] a policy update. It is an industrial
[28:11] scale mobilization comparable only to
[28:14] the Eisenhower era interstate highway
[28:16] system or even the Manhattan project. I
[28:19] don't know how this doesn't say PMI
[28:21] going higher over the course of the
[28:22] year. It is big. This is potentially the
[28:25] broadest US industrial strategy we've
[28:26] seen since Eisenhower. Is it a plan to
[28:28] turn the US into one huge AI factory?
[28:32] The deregulation and acceleration again
[28:34] this is really really important to
[28:35] fasttrack. Fasttrack was uh important in
[28:38] the vaccine for COVID infrastructure and
[28:40] energy buildout. We need both the
[28:42] infrastructure for the data centers. We
[28:44] need the energy the cooling systems and
[28:46] that energy not chips is the bottleneck.
[28:48] We're at a different stage. We were
[28:50] using excess capacity of energy and
[28:53] using chips that were available. Now
[28:55] we've got back orders of everything and
[28:57] we've been underinvested
[28:59] inside the industrial space for
[29:02] turbines, for transformers, for cooling
[29:04] systems, for everything. It's going to
[29:05] take a while for this to catch up. Uh
[29:08] again, it's electricity. Uh we are not
[29:10] chip limited with electricity uh
[29:13] limited.
[29:14] Calls out nuclear geothermal but not
[29:17] solar. This is an important point by
[29:18] Blondon. Even the best solar strategy
[29:20] doesn't matter if you can't deploy it
[29:21] fast. The plan is about what we can
[29:22] build now.
[29:24] Now is the the the critical thing.
[29:27] Uh Richard Jark or Rard Jark put this
[29:30] out. Uh we're still on the massive
[29:32] demand for AI chips, data centers, and
[29:33] energy. Uh we're in a world where
[29:35] nothing big ever happens. So we have no
[29:38] way of processing it till something big
[29:39] happens. Peter Thiel said that this is
[29:41] this PMI thing. We're living in a world
[29:43] where nothing big ever happens. what's
[29:44] happening in AI is about to go parabolic
[29:48] and people are not on top of what it
[29:51] means to go to the inference workloads
[29:54] and then we're going to go into AI
[29:56] agents which transforms everything and
[29:58] then when you get past that you've got
[29:59] to add humanoids
[30:01] AV AR all being unlocked by these
[30:04] breakthroughs uh in the next 5 10 years
[30:07] you have a massive super semian energy
[30:09] cycle that we're all severely
[30:11] underestimating there's no way that it
[30:13] doesn't happen other than supply not
[30:16] being able to met be met by demand. Um
[30:19] on that podcast again, building an
[30:21] atomic bond can never be done unless you
[30:23] turn the United States into one huge
[30:25] factory. The AI action plan is doing
[30:26] exactly that. We are on an acceleration
[30:29] of the acceleration. This is being
[30:32] executed by executive order. This is not
[30:34] a matter of if, it's a matter of go.
[30:36] Unlike typical US industrial strategies
[30:38] that change with political winds, this
[30:40] plan has continually guaranteed for at
[30:42] least three and a half years under a
[30:44] single administration and it's
[30:46] synchronized. This is the important
[30:47] point which I'm going to get into. The
[30:49] expected peak of AGI development. We're
[30:51] incredibly lucky. We have continuity for
[30:54] three and a half years right through the
[30:55] AGI explosion window. The AGI explosion
[30:57] window is happening now. This is where
[30:59] things start to go parabolic. And they
[31:02] talk about the fact that David Saxs
[31:04] because he and the brilliant people in
[31:05] Washington are making it clear to DC
[31:09] that this is not a question of whether
[31:11] we should do it. We have to do it. And
[31:13] this is what was released by Zuckerberg
[31:15] this week. Over the last few months,
[31:17] we've begun to see glimpses of our AI
[31:19] systems improving themselves. The
[31:20] improvement is slow for now, but
[31:22] undeniable. Developing super
[31:24] intelligence is now in sight.
[31:27] I talked to with uh Pomp Anthony
[31:30] Pompiano about this on our podcast uh
[31:32] yesterday. Uh we've what what they're
[31:35] talking about is reaching the point of
[31:37] recursive self-improvement
[31:39] when AI is able to learn on its own. How
[31:41] fast will things speed up? This is the
[31:43] critical part and we talked about in
[31:44] Pomp, but I just want to make sure you
[31:46] guys can think about it. You can go do
[31:47] your own search on there. It can learn,
[31:51] write, and improve on its own code
[31:52] without human intervention. things could
[31:54] speed up at an exponential or even super
[31:57] exponential rate. This concept is
[31:59] referred to as the intelligence
[32:01] explosion or hard takeoff at AI theory.
[32:04] If we're nearing 100% time savings and
[32:06] AI is writing itself at this point, Alex
[32:08] is saying we're already there. If math
[32:10] and physics are about to quote unquote
[32:12] solve by AGI, maybe we'll know as soon
[32:14] as the next 6 to9 months. Why? It speeds
[32:17] up faster model improvement, automation
[32:19] of R&D, which has huge implications for
[32:21] healthcare, quantum everything, an
[32:23] elimination of iteration delay. Once AI
[32:26] starts improving itself reliably, months
[32:28] of human progress could occur in days or
[32:31] even hours leading to breakthroughs
[32:34] across all scientific domains in
[32:36] compressed timelines. That's the part
[32:39] that right now the market has not priced
[32:40] in. Um, it has huge implications for
[32:43] everything. Uh, recursive
[32:45] self-improvement is imminent. If we're
[32:48] nearing Oh, I already went through this
[32:50] one. Uh,
[32:53] yeah, all this stuff is already there,
[32:54] so I don't need to go through it again.
[32:56] We're talking about having centuries of
[32:59] uh, progress happening in years now.
[33:01] Within three to five years, this is from
[33:03] Eric Schmidt recently, will have what is
[33:05] called AGI. This is possible because a
[33:06] process called recursive
[33:08] self-improvement. They're able to learn
[33:09] on their own. Uh, it represents the
[33:12] critical threshold when AI systems begin
[33:14] improving themselves. And again, I'm
[33:15] bringing this up now because these are
[33:18] all the leaders of AI saying the same
[33:19] thing. Lex Friedman, so that podcast
[33:21] from Eric Schmidt was two weeks ago. Lex
[33:23] Friedman was two weeks ago. Alpha
[33:25] involve enables on the programming side
[33:27] something like recursive
[33:28] self-improvement potentially.
[33:32] When you hone it out, it it's very good
[33:34] at incrementally improving that.
[33:37] Sam Alman, we're now starting to look
[33:39] ahead to super intelligence.
[33:42] This is a kind of brain of the world. It
[33:43] will be personal, adaptable, easy to
[33:45] use. It will give people incredible
[33:47] superpowers with that were sort of
[33:49] science fiction only a couple years ago.
[33:51] The limit won't be the algorithms, the
[33:52] research, but it increasingly becomes
[33:54] the physical instantation
[33:57] that is takes to make this work. Chips,
[33:59] cable, servers, energy, everything that
[34:01] you need to power this brain. Again, we
[34:03] are at that point now where it's
[34:05] accelerating. But think of it as it
[34:07] needs unlimited food. The power that it
[34:09] gets is food. We don't have enough food
[34:12] to feed this. So we have to build it.
[34:14] And if we don't build it fast, and China
[34:16] will build it fast, you can see where
[34:18] this becomes not only self-improvement
[34:20] or self-learning. It becomes
[34:22] self-fulfilling for all the reasons that
[34:24] I mentioned. GPT5 launch is coming. This
[34:26] will accelerate the talk of it. Uh and
[34:28] it's coming very very soon, possibly
[34:30] next week. Uh Sam Alman says he's afraid
[34:33] of GPT5 creation. What we have done
[34:36] raised alarm and concern over the
[34:38] company's soon to launch AI model which
[34:39] is rapidly outpacing oversight learning
[34:42] on itself.
[34:44] Again
[34:45] we're at an unbelievable point in
[34:47] history. Um Anthropic I'm bringing this
[34:49] up because they near funding round at
[34:52] 170 billion. Uh XAI Musk's one got one
[34:56] at 200 recently and OpenAI got one at
[34:58] 350. These are all private companies
[35:00] that combined are approaching a trillion
[35:01] dollars and will probably be there. That
[35:03] just shows how fast these are moving. Uh
[35:06] Bitcoin sharp correction. Uh again,
[35:08] these are the monthly numbers.
[35:11] It's it's down 2% for the month. I
[35:13] continue to believe Bitcoin will
[35:15] represent and its growth will mimic AGI
[35:19] or mimic uh AI as it goes. It's the
[35:21] purest way to AI. This was a big week
[35:24] for just the administration again moving
[35:26] forth. This was an op-ed uh by Bessant
[35:29] uh in the Washington Post. The
[35:32] highlights of it I'll leave for you guys
[35:33] to read. It's all stuff we've talked
[35:35] about on here, but they are dead serious
[35:37] about all of this stuff being a big part
[35:39] on it. Um they are focused on this being
[35:42] an AI race as well. They think this is a
[35:45] dominant force to get ahead, especially
[35:48] with stablecoin. This is a 166 page
[35:51] report from the White House,
[35:52] strengthening American leadership in
[35:54] digital financial technology came out
[35:56] this week. We are trying to own the
[35:57] guardrails of finance. Uh the SEC rolled
[36:00] out project crypto to rewrite the rules
[36:02] for digital assets. No other country in
[36:04] the world is doing this at this point.
[36:06] President Trump says Bitcoin is amazing
[36:08] and producing a lot of jobs. He views
[36:10] cryptocurrency as an industry.
[36:13] Uh this came out in Project Syndicate. I
[36:16] think everyone should be reading these
[36:17] now. I'm highlighting the stuff that
[36:19] came out this week. This just shows the
[36:21] breadth of what's going on. Everyone in
[36:22] the traditional finance and the
[36:24] traditional economic world is finally
[36:26] talking about crypto and stable coins. A
[36:28] year ago, no one was talking about this
[36:30] other than it being a scam and
[36:32] speculative stable coin. This is a great
[36:34] article to read uh in terms of
[36:36] understanding stable coins, but kind of
[36:38] connecting it back to macro and where we
[36:40] are, how fast this person makes the
[36:42] argument, which I agree with, that it's
[36:43] going to accelerate this stable coins
[36:46] and transactions in the ecosystem. The
[36:48] network effects are about to explode
[36:49] because of AI agents. They are directly
[36:51] tied back to the AGI side. If you are
[36:54] spending time worrying about tariffs,
[36:56] worrying about PMIs, worrying about uh
[36:59] job losses and everything in recessions,
[37:01] you're missing out on what matters.
[37:03] Stable coins are far more important than
[37:05] Whirlpool at this point. Stable coins
[37:07] ECB are reshaping global finance with
[37:10] the dollar at the helm without a
[37:12] strategic response.
[37:14] This is important from hype to hazard.
[37:17] What stable coins mean for Europe?
[37:19] Hazard for Europe. If they don't have a
[37:21] plan on them, they're in trouble. They
[37:22] realize it now. Stable coins are
[37:24] reshaping global finance with US dollar
[37:26] at the helm without a strategic
[37:27] response. European monetary and they're
[37:29] finally starting to pay attention that
[37:32] if the banks are launching them, how
[37:34] quickly we saw Silicon Valley Bank take
[37:37] all of its dep lose all of its deposits.
[37:40] Think about how quickly it would happen
[37:41] in the traditional finance world if
[37:43] every bank was connected to stable coins
[37:45] where it's taking seconds. At least at
[37:47] Silicon Valley Bank, it took hours to
[37:49] days. We're now talking about seconds.
[37:51] Exank of China chief warns of major risk
[37:54] from stable coins. Criticizes US
[37:56] efforts. Everyone's going to get more
[37:58] involved in it. They have to get more
[37:59] involved in it. It's going to be a race.
[38:01] Every G country is looking to buy
[38:02] Bitcoin for its reserves. Hyper
[38:05] Bitcoinization has begun. Completely
[38:07] agree. And again, I'm tying it
[38:08] completely back to AI. Uh and you've
[38:11] still got every company will be a
[38:13] Bitcoin treasury company.
[38:16] If you want to have assets and money
[38:18] saved in a place where they're not
[38:20] getting debased, owning treasuries will
[38:22] be an issue and more and more people
[38:24] will continue to look as Bitcoin as
[38:26] something that goes in because it's the
[38:27] future. Uh even Ray Dallio who had been
[38:31] positive on Bitcoin but not egregiously
[38:34] um went out and recommended a 15%
[38:36] allocation to Bitcoin. And then finally,
[38:39] I just want to remind people if I'm
[38:41] right about the PMIs going higher and
[38:43] everything that you saw here that AGI is
[38:44] fueling PMIs to go higher because the
[38:46] buildout is happening because of
[38:47] deregulation, because of fasttrack,
[38:50] because of back orders that all
[38:51] companies are reporting right now,
[38:53] because trucking companies are starting
[38:55] to show it. This is what Bitcoin has
[38:57] done during PMI rises. We've also had
[38:59] the printing of money. I continue to
[39:01] believe that's the story. That's it for
[39:02] this week. Uh, hope everyone's having a
[39:04] great summer and I'll see you next
