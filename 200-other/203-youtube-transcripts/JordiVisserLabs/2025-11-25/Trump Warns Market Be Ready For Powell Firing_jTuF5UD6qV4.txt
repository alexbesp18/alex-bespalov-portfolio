--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] week with Donald Trump as president. Uh
[00:04] Fed independence growing uh your way out
[00:07] of it. Eric Schmidt, the natural limit
[00:10] of AI is electricity. 10,000 times
[00:12] demand versus supply. The real AI race
[00:15] inflation or growth and crypto week and
[00:17] all breakouts. Let's get right to it.
[00:21] So, uh S&P for the week uh is now
[00:24] consolidating, but again able to make
[00:26] new all-time highs. Chart looks great.
[00:29] Um, still a lot of uh sentiment that I
[00:33] would say is worried. We don't have
[00:34] extreme bullish sentiment. We're still
[00:36] kind of middle of the pack. Uh, and this
[00:39] week we got rate fears again in terms of
[00:41] uh 30-year yields around the globe
[00:43] breaking out. Uh, but 10-year yields
[00:46] still sitting here. So, really, it's
[00:47] been a 10 30 steepener. I'll get through
[00:50] some of that as we go on. Fed rate cuts,
[00:53] we still have better than 50% chance
[00:55] built into the market for September. Uh
[00:58] and if you go out to the end of next
[01:00] year in December of 26, we're talking uh
[01:05] significant five rate cuts almost still
[01:07] built in by the end of next year. So uh
[01:10] as I go through this and talk about
[01:12] growth,
[01:14] government's focused on growth. Uh so
[01:17] rate cuts into growth, rate cuts into no
[01:20] recession, just very powerful for stocks
[01:23] and liquidity. Uh so at this point as
[01:26] earnings are better uh there's really
[01:28] you know there's there's just a lot of
[01:30] good stuff going on and I don't see a
[01:32] recession uh as a problem. So I think
[01:34] it's more likely that inflation is the
[01:36] next scare but we'll go through that. So
[01:38] uh dollar it's bounced now for really
[01:42] about two and a half three weeks uh but
[01:44] dramatically oversold and positive
[01:46] liquidity boost uh with a delay of about
[01:49] 3 to six months. So, still coming
[01:52] through um CPI this week. So, I just
[01:55] wanted to show this. These are the last
[01:56] five. These yellow dots are where the
[01:59] actual number came in. These histograms
[02:01] are the economist forecast. So, you can
[02:04] see it's five months in a row. Uh this
[02:07] one getting a little bit closer to the
[02:08] center, but still this was supposed to
[02:11] be the tariff fears on this and there is
[02:13] tariff uh inflation within there. The
[02:15] inflation j has been weaker than
[02:17] expected and it should be no surprise
[02:19] that Donald Trump went on the war path
[02:21] again uh for
[02:24] for the Fed and drone pal uh
[02:28] specifically now choking out the housing
[02:30] market. I think this is interesting.
[02:31] I've talked about the fact that I think
[02:33] they will do something to help the
[02:35] housing situation, but one of the things
[02:37] they want to do is uh get rates down to
[02:40] 1%. Yes, 1%. It wasn't just Trump
[02:44] though. You've got PY continuing. Uh
[02:48] they're trying to use the building out
[02:50] of the innovations for two and a half
[02:52] billion as there Rick Scott all over
[02:54] him. Uh then you had this on Wednesday
[02:58] asking GOP lawyers this seemed to be a
[03:00] trial balloon to see what the market
[03:02] reaction would be. Trump likely to fire
[03:04] pal soon. White House official. This
[03:07] reminds me of exactly what happened
[03:10] before the 90-day tariff side. In that
[03:12] case they were wondering what it would
[03:14] do. The market ripped higher in this
[03:16] case. I think they wanted to see whether
[03:17] the market would respond better to one
[03:19] you know saying moving rates lower while
[03:22] the economy strong and obviously the
[03:24] market saw the dollar come down. You saw
[03:28] rates go higher and you saw stocks come
[03:29] down. So you had bonds, stocks and the
[03:33] dollar down and uh it seems like uh
[03:36] they're backing off and he said later in
[03:37] the week they're not going to fire him.
[03:39] The qu question is and where this gets
[03:40] into it. Can the Fed stay independent?
[03:43] Trump adviser may put it to the test.
[03:46] Uh, I'd say it's already done. That's my
[03:49] own opinion. Um,
[03:51] fiscal dominance and financial
[03:53] repression ahead. I put this in there
[03:56] because again, I think the goal here is
[03:59] very simple. The mounting interest rate
[04:01] costs associated with serving the
[04:03] massive government debt. It's going to
[04:05] get worse getting forward. He already
[04:08] had to put the one big beautiful bill in
[04:11] place. Uh got a lot of conservatives
[04:14] very angry that the spending was there.
[04:16] So he's going to be focused on growing
[04:18] and somehow another getting the deficit
[04:20] down. Some of that's going to be through
[04:22] the tariffs, which is the aggression on
[04:24] that. Uh and then the other one is to
[04:26] make sure that rates are coming down uh
[04:28] to service the interest costs. He'd like
[04:30] them down now to try and get this going
[04:32] ahead of the midterm elections and have
[04:34] something to show for it. but he's
[04:37] probably going to have to wait. Uh but
[04:39] regardless, there's a shadow Fed. Now,
[04:41] Wall Street hates the idea of a shadow
[04:43] Fed. It may already have one. Uh I want
[04:45] to basically get into people need to
[04:47] think about this not from uh a what they
[04:51] think President Trump should do or what
[04:52] they think the Fed should do, but just
[04:55] on the rules of the game. Um you got one
[04:57] of the potential one of the four uh
[05:00] listed candidates uh saying uh he might
[05:04] dissent at the next meeting. thinking
[05:06] there should be a cut because the labor
[05:08] market is soft. I'm going to continue to
[05:10] say the labor market is going to be an
[05:11] issue. Uh we got some more details on
[05:14] this this week in terms of just how long
[05:17] it's taken for people to get a job,
[05:20] particularly for 20 to 24 year olds. Uh
[05:24] there's no doubt that we're getting a
[05:26] change in the jobs market from AI. I've
[05:28] talked about this being less about job
[05:30] losses in terms of people getting fired
[05:33] and more about a combination of less
[05:36] hiring or no hiring from the bigger
[05:38] companies. Uh startups happening which
[05:40] aren't going to create lots of jobs
[05:42] because they're using AI and you're
[05:44] going to be left with this peri
[05:47] let's say not not confident uh that
[05:50] their jobs are safe. They're going to be
[05:52] living in a world of paranoia wondering
[05:53] when they're going to lose their job.
[05:54] that just makes the confidence in the
[05:56] job situation where you're getting paid
[05:57] but you don't feel good. So, I think
[05:59] that's going to be a story and I think
[06:01] that's one of the reasons why uh whether
[06:03] the Fed likes it or not, I actually
[06:05] believe they should be lowering rates at
[06:07] this point because if inflation does get
[06:09] higher, I don't expect it to go too far,
[06:10] but they can always turn around and
[06:12] raise rates. But again, not what they
[06:15] should do, it's what they are doing and
[06:17] what President Trump is doing and what
[06:18] Scott Besson is saying. Again, we can
[06:22] grow the economy and control the debt.
[06:24] that is the what they're going with. Um,
[06:25] and whether or not they're able to
[06:27] succeed, that's not our job. Our job is
[06:29] to make money on the markets. Uh, and I
[06:31] think, uh, this podcast this week with
[06:34] Raul Powell and Julian
[06:36] Patel uh, is worth listening to. Very
[06:39] few macro people uh, that I listen to on
[06:41] a regular basis uh, are able to kind of
[06:44] go through the quote unquote no
[06:46] recession thing. the fact that we've
[06:48] transitioned from a credit recession
[06:50] related time to where the government is
[06:53] just too big and where innovation is
[06:55] exponentially moving. Both of which have
[06:57] occurred since the great financial
[06:58] crisis. But Ra Pal and Julian and I are
[07:01] all in agreement on this in terms of
[07:02] what's going on. So rather than only
[07:04] listen to me on this, they have a
[07:06] different um approach towards this. I
[07:08] think it's worth a listen to. This
[07:10] podcast was very good. you won't hear
[07:11] many macro podcasts uh that I think
[07:14] focus on the things that are going to
[07:15] help you make money at this point as
[07:17] opposed to trying to scare you. I talked
[07:19] about the PMIs last week. Uh we got two
[07:23] or the early two manufacturing data
[07:25] points and I just want to reiterate this
[07:27] again. I believe the most important
[07:30] theme for the next year is going to be
[07:33] that manufacturing is entering a very
[07:36] very big boom period driven by AI and
[07:39] the infrastructure buildout. Empire
[07:41] Manufacturing came in 5 something. Here
[07:44] are the histograms on the forecast. Way
[07:46] above consensus. Philly Fed came in at
[07:49] 15. Way above consensus. Again, I just
[07:53] think we're going to start and at some
[07:54] point, whether it's this month, next
[07:56] month, the month after, I do think we're
[07:58] going to see a big jump in the PMI. And
[08:01] it comes at a time when people are
[08:02] worried about the trade war or
[08:04] continuing to focus on it. This was
[08:06] something people should spend more time
[08:08] on. Wed Bush made a commentary on, but
[08:10] this is about the announcement that was
[08:12] made in Pennsylvania for a $90 billion
[08:14] plus focused on the technology and inter
[08:18] energy sectors. 36 billion for data
[08:20] center development and 56 billion for
[08:22] energy infrastructure projects.
[08:25] Wedbush noted the scaleless public and
[08:27] private investment expected drive a
[08:28] super cycle of growth for companies
[08:30] positioned within the AI energy and
[08:32] digital infrastructure ecosystem
[08:34] underscored that the buildout will lead
[08:36] to tens of thousands of construction and
[08:38] permanent jobs with multiplier effect
[08:40] expected across local economies of data
[08:42] centers. This is what Donald Trump
[08:44] wants. He wants to see the manufacturing
[08:46] sector pay. We are spending a lot of
[08:48] money. The hyperscalers are spending
[08:50] money. I believe you're going to see
[08:52] something similar
[08:54] in terms of the impact it had to the
[08:56] fracking boom uh the various parts of
[08:58] the economy they're going to benefit
[09:00] from this and then from an overall
[09:02] dollar amount and impact to commodities
[09:04] and impact everything. I'm going to
[09:06] continue to say this is going to be
[09:08] similar to the China urbanization story
[09:10] at least from way people are going to
[09:11] have to look at it. Uh best podcast of
[09:14] the week if you listen to one of the
[09:16] ones that I give you. I've got a bunch
[09:18] uh moonshots with Eric Schmidt.
[09:20] Definitely worth it. Eric Schmidt is by
[09:22] far my favorite person to listen to on
[09:24] the AI buildout. He's not only
[09:25] articulate and informed. It reminds me
[09:28] of Michael Milin. He's just involved
[09:30] with so many people in conversations on
[09:32] a regular basis. He doesn't run a
[09:33] company at this point. It makes him
[09:35] unique where he's just gathering
[09:36] information. He seems to have the brain
[09:38] to be able to consume tremendous amounts
[09:40] of data and he's great at connecting
[09:42] dots. In fact, one of the best I've
[09:44] seen. He doesn't have a big side of him.
[09:46] He is the one that has said repeatedly
[09:47] AI is definitely underhyped. This is the
[09:50] thing that's most important uh in terms
[09:52] of he said this at the very beginning in
[09:54] the first two minutes of the podcast. AI
[09:56] is a learning machine and in network
[09:58] effect businesses when the learning
[09:59] machine learns faster everything
[10:01] accelerates. It accelerates to its
[10:03] natural limit. The natural limit is
[10:05] electricity not chips electricity
[10:08] really.
[10:09] The bottleneck in AI and acceleration is
[10:12] the available of the availability of
[10:14] energy, particularly electricity. I've
[10:17] said this all year. I'm going to
[10:19] continue to say it. You have to be
[10:20] focused now on power and not just the
[10:24] things that you've read about. And the
[10:26] reason is he talks about this
[10:27] explicitly. In my recent testimony, I
[10:30] talked about the current expected need
[10:31] for AI revolution US. It's 92 gawatts of
[10:34] more power.
[10:36] One gawatt is one big nuclear power.
[10:39] There's essentially none being started
[10:41] now and there have been two in the last
[10:44] 30 years. As important as nuclear, both
[10:46] fision and fusion is, they're not going
[10:49] to arrive in time to us to get what we
[10:50] need as a globe to deal with our many
[10:52] problems and opportunities are there.
[10:54] So,
[10:56] we're not going to be able to do it with
[10:57] the solutions that people seem to be
[10:59] focused on. And that's his point is that
[11:01] this has to be other things. And so he
[11:04] goes on to talk about the energy sources
[11:07] that are going to be there. Without
[11:09] going through this, the computing needs
[11:11] that we have are not going to come from
[11:12] or are now going to come from
[11:14] traditional any energy suppliers in
[11:16] place like the USD world. This means
[11:18] fossil fuels and he specifically said
[11:20] from the fossil fuels, natural gas,
[11:22] hydroelectric and traditional suppliers.
[11:25] Again, I'm going to say Exxon, Chevron.
[11:27] I'm going to talk about all the
[11:28] buildouts of these things, the things
[11:30] where we already have stuff. You're
[11:32] going to have to see every source of
[11:34] electrons of energy used. Everything is
[11:38] going to be needed cuz we cannot
[11:39] possibly get the power that we need at
[11:42] this point. He talks about the fact that
[11:44] there may be solutions later to solve
[11:46] this that could speed up, meaning ways
[11:48] to get more energy, but we're not there
[11:50] yet. So, he goes through the arrival of
[11:52] super intelligence, AI's insatiable
[11:54] energy demand again goes through that.
[11:56] The hardware and computer arms race.
[11:58] talked about this and he went through
[11:59] the software in this Andy Grove giveth
[12:02] and Bill Gates take it away meaning
[12:03] software always eats new computing
[12:05] capacity. I'm highlighting this because
[12:07] the next time you get to the point where
[12:09] there's a sell-off in AI, which I think
[12:12] is going to be less likely to happen,
[12:13] meaning the deep sea uh side here, where
[12:16] there's fears, just remember underneath
[12:18] you should be staying with these things.
[12:20] The demand side is going to be much much
[12:22] bigger than people believe uh even at
[12:25] this point.
[12:26] Uh just going through this just other
[12:28] things in there. I'm not going to go
[12:29] through the reading of it. You can go
[12:31] listen to the podcast. Uh, another
[12:33] podcast uh that kind of reinforced the
[12:35] energy problem. This is from uh Andre
[12:37] and Horowitz's podcast A16Z came out
[12:41] this week. America's energy problem, the
[12:43] grid that built America can't power its
[12:44] future. Again, the amount of dollars
[12:47] that are going to need to be spent on
[12:48] this. Two more Moonshot podcasts.
[12:50] Believe it or not, Peter Demonis and
[12:52] Moonshots. I very seldom meet anyone
[12:54] that listens to these. Uh he does at
[12:56] least one a week and they're all
[12:58] brilliant in terms of the details. These
[13:00] guys all know the AI space well. As much
[13:03] as I like BG2, they don't have their
[13:05] hands in this the way that these guys
[13:07] do. Um, these guys are heavily involved.
[13:09] They're MIT guys. It is just deep and
[13:12] dirty in terms of what they're going
[13:13] through. So, you'll learn a lot if you
[13:15] listen to it every week and they ended
[13:17] up having three podcasts or three
[13:19] podcasts this week alone in the last six
[13:21] days. Um, they go through the GPU demand
[13:23] and supply, talk about Gro 4, that's
[13:25] what this one is about.
[13:27] Um, if you haven't spent time on
[13:29] Colossus, I highly recommend that in
[13:31] terms of there's a couple uh YouTubes
[13:33] out there. They're each about 10 to 15
[13:35] minutes just to get the scale and the
[13:36] size of this because as I go through
[13:38] this, you're going to see uh a ton. They
[13:42] go through the bottlenecks again, the
[13:44] GPUs, the interconnect infrastructure,
[13:47] power, cooling, logistics, all of these
[13:50] things are in big problems in terms of
[13:53] supply chain issues particularly on the
[13:54] GPUs. In two years, robots will be good
[13:57] enough to do 90 to 95% of labor. The
[14:00] only reason it won't flip the global
[14:02] economy is the supply chains. I think
[14:04] that's important for everyone to
[14:05] realize. When you hear, and I said it
[14:08] last week, um that humanoids will not be
[14:11] dominating uh our marketplace for at
[14:13] least the next 5 years. It's a supply
[14:15] chain issue. It's not the ability to
[14:16] build them. It's not the capabilities.
[14:17] Within two years, they're saying they're
[14:19] all ready. It's just a question of
[14:20] building it out, which means once it
[14:22] stops, the dollars will flow from
[14:24] everybody who wants them. There will be
[14:26] infinite demand. If you've listened to
[14:28] Chris Camilillo talk about his
[14:30] experience with this, there's already
[14:31] the big companies going to get infinite
[14:33] labor. The cost, which will be a rental
[14:37] situation, which will also be the case
[14:39] uh long-term with robo taxis, everything
[14:42] is going to be working for you. The
[14:44] amount of disruption that's coming
[14:46] inside the next three years is dramatic,
[14:48] but the dollars that are flowing will
[14:50] just continue. They'll be coming from
[14:52] other sources. Uh, so I won't go through
[14:55] this whole thing. We're heading toward a
[14:56] world where the most powerful tech in
[14:58] history will cost pennies to use.
[15:03] Don't fade it. Uh, GPU is being driven
[15:06] by two forces, intelligence and scale,
[15:08] AI agents, and the video world models.
[15:11] They talk a lot about the importance of
[15:13] video. I brought this up with the Jibli
[15:15] stuff for the token usage and then also
[15:18] V3. I bring this up because they go
[15:21] through why video is so important. It is
[15:23] not for movies in terms of the ability.
[15:25] It's the ability of doing things. Robots
[15:28] for bodies, the GPUs for brains.
[15:30] Everything in there in terms of vision
[15:33] becomes critical for using these things.
[15:36] Main thing I want to highlight here
[15:37] which I highlighted in the in the
[15:39] outlook or in the beginning, demand for
[15:41] compute to support AI is projected to be
[15:44] 10,000 times higher than supply for the
[15:46] foreseeable future. This was definitely
[15:49] somewhat tongue andcheek in terms of
[15:51] what was said, but regardless, this is
[15:55] it. It's the amount of power that's
[15:59] needed, the memory, the cooling, it
[16:02] keeps getting more and more as we go
[16:04] forward. No matter how much the
[16:06] efficiencies are, you have to remember
[16:09] this is just going to keep going. orders
[16:13] of magnitude gap between where compute
[16:15] demand is headed and where supplying
[16:17] currently stands. Accelerated computing
[16:20] is not a luxury, it's a necessity. And
[16:22] again, I'm going to go through the
[16:23] reasons why the funding for this will
[16:26] just continue because it is a race for
[16:28] obsolescence. It is a race for military
[16:30] supremacy. I've said it before, I'll
[16:31] continue to say it. You have to spend
[16:33] all your time on this going forward.
[16:35] It's less about the people spending
[16:37] money and what the AI software companies
[16:39] have done. I believe you need to be
[16:41] doing this all on the PMI names and all
[16:43] on the hardware side. So, I'm going to
[16:44] keep pounding the table on this. Uh if
[16:46] I'm wrong, I I'll be surprised. I've
[16:49] been wrong plenty of times before, but
[16:51] this one, because we've had the PMI
[16:52] sitting below 50 for a long time, I like
[16:55] to look for scenarios where the
[16:57] positioning is off sides. And right now
[16:59] when I look at Exxon and I look at
[17:00] Chevron and I look at Freeport Magan and
[17:03] I look at Caterpillar and I look at Deer
[17:05] and I look at Parker Hannifin as much of
[17:07] those companies have done well they have
[17:09] still underperformed the other side and
[17:12] they are trading very very cheap two
[17:14] years out compared to where a lot of the
[17:16] Mag 7 and a lot of the software names
[17:18] are trading. So
[17:20] uh data center semiconductors high
[17:23] bandwidth memory liquid cooling power
[17:25] utilities renewable sources all to
[17:27] benefit consider long-term structural
[17:29] plays in energy, real estate, chip
[17:31] manufacturing, not software. Again,
[17:33] these are all from the the insights that
[17:35] came out of that. Goldman Sachs, new
[17:38] stuff on the hyperscaler capex
[17:40] increasing sharply through 2027.
[17:43] Um, almost all places are now taking up
[17:46] their numbers because of what we're
[17:47] seeing. Uh, and this is one of the
[17:49] reasons. Meta to spend hundreds of
[17:51] billions to build AI data centers. So,
[17:53] this is out this week. Meta is not only
[17:54] hiring tons of people, they realize to
[17:57] actually get super intelligence, they
[17:59] need to secure more and more places of
[18:02] power and data centers. So, let's just
[18:05] go through. I'm not going to take the
[18:07] whole thing, but Zuck confirms that they
[18:09] are building multiple gigawatt clusters,
[18:13] uh, large ones, Hyperion, Prometheus,
[18:15] these are the names on. To give you an
[18:17] idea of the size, if you haven't seen
[18:19] this, uh, this is Manhattan. This is the
[18:24] Hyperion data center basically the
[18:27] design plans in terms of size just this
[18:30] is building cities. So when I say the
[18:31] China urbanization you have to be there.
[18:34] So what we look for is we go in earnings
[18:35] period since this tariff stuff has now
[18:37] gone down we look for any kind of
[18:39] details that we can find in terms of
[18:41] what's happening on the industrial side
[18:42] and going through it. Uhu had
[18:46] uh a call this week uh with uh a data
[18:50] center guru.
[18:52] The rate of orders remain elevated with
[18:53] no anticipated air pockets given the
[18:56] sheer demand strength for capacity
[18:58] augmented by rising AI workloads.
[19:02] Given the massive increase in demand
[19:04] there are three main issues impending
[19:05] supply from the coming market. Top
[19:07] constraint is energy again energy energy
[19:11] and supply constraints for mechanical
[19:13] and engineering process may also
[19:14] struggle to keep pace with the buildout
[19:16] as thermal density continues to
[19:17] increase. supply and demand issues will
[19:19] be out there. And then as you start to
[19:21] look for companies, we had two companies
[19:23] on the industrial side in Europe that
[19:25] reported that had big up moves this week
[19:27] where they came in higher than expected.
[19:30] ABB, a Swiss company. US orders were
[19:33] especially notable, jumping 37%
[19:35] year-over-year in the second quarter,
[19:36] far outpacing the company's overall 14%
[19:39] earning growth, marking the US as ABB's
[19:41] largest and fastest growing market.
[19:44] Booming demand from AI data centers,
[19:46] electrification, infrastructure
[19:48] upgrades. Uh the trading environment in
[19:50] the US remains strong with demand
[19:52] sustained by investment. The next time
[19:54] you hear about recession, just remember
[19:55] this. This is why I'm bringing this up.
[19:57] The PMIs are going to show you look to
[19:59] see what the companies are saying. And
[20:00] again, this is all from perplexity. Just
[20:02] going through and looking for it. Lron,
[20:05] a French company, delivered 20% organic
[20:07] sales growth in North America. Uh US
[20:11] again was the dominant standout
[20:12] performer. Data center segment now
[20:14] accounts for 20% of total sales. Again,
[20:16] think about that. Data center segment
[20:18] now accounts for 20%. CEO specifically
[20:21] credit US hypers scale projects. The
[20:24] entire organic growth for the quarter
[20:26] came from data center demand.
[20:29] Now they're raising guidance. So you can
[20:32] see everything down here. Despite some
[20:35] ongoing macro uncertainties, tariffs,
[20:37] both companies raised their outlook for
[20:38] the US manufacturing environment through
[20:40] the rest of 2025.
[20:42] Uh
[20:45] this all comes at a time. Remember
[20:48] this is what we look like back in 1990.
[20:51] Manufacturing and retail dominated the
[20:53] job market. And now the top employer in
[20:55] each market is basically healthcare and
[20:57] professional services. This little area
[21:00] in here is the green. So Trump's focused
[21:03] on a swing state over here.
[21:05] Manufacturing in terms of the 92
[21:07] billion. Uh we are going to focus oursel
[21:09] on manufacturing. This buildout is going
[21:11] to happen and this comes at a time when
[21:14] the BFA fund manager survey number one
[21:17] tail risk.
[21:19] It's still global recession from trade
[21:21] war. People are still worried about
[21:23] trade war. Inflation's number two. Uh
[21:26] dollar I didn't understand this one. AI
[21:29] equity bubbles going down. Uh so we'll
[21:31] we'll see where all this goes. But the
[21:34] given fact people have recession trade
[21:36] trade war fears. I'm going to continue
[21:39] to say something I've said which I very
[21:40] seldom see people say. I'm going to
[21:42] shift my focus to the China US trade
[21:45] deal. Um Trump softens tone on China to
[21:48] secure she summit and a trade deal. So
[21:51] regardless of what you think is going on
[21:54] the reality is there seems to be a truce
[21:56] going on between the two countries. And
[21:57] again you're seeing oh China lifts
[22:00] exports of rare earth. China's exports
[22:02] of rare earth products rose 80% in June
[22:04] from a 5-year low in May according to
[22:06] customs data. Uh
[22:10] Nvidia got to resume AI chips to China
[22:12] this week as part of rare earth talks
[22:15] says US.
[22:18] Some articles for you guys to read on
[22:20] why again I highlighted why the
[22:22] hyperscalers are just going to continue
[22:24] to spend that Trump is going to uh put
[22:26] money from a manufacturingbased
[22:28] perspective. But then there's this is
[22:31] the US ready for the next war. This was
[22:33] in the New Yorker this week and you can
[22:36] go through the details but basically
[22:39] uh is the US ready for the next war?
[22:41] Policy makers as artificial intelligence
[22:43] and drone technology transformed the
[22:45] nature of global war for recent
[22:47] conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle
[22:48] East have revealed vulnerabilities and
[22:51] sparked urgent moves to mon modernize
[22:53] the US military. Again, the rare earth
[22:55] situation has scared the hell out of
[22:57] them. They can't do any of this stuff
[22:59] without rare earth. So whenever you get
[23:01] the point that China and the US are
[23:03] going to break off trade deals, I don't
[23:06] see that happening. And so as long as
[23:07] China, where everything on the supply
[23:10] chain is dependent on China, is an
[23:13] issue, I think you're going to see the
[23:14] tariff situation not matter
[23:17] in terms of this. You should go read the
[23:18] article and just see. But again, the
[23:21] defense department is overhauling the
[23:23] drone. Americanmade affordable and AIM
[23:25] man systems. competitive urgency
[23:27] analysts warned the US could lose its
[23:28] edge if it fails. I'm going to read the
[23:30] whole thing again. The whole point is
[23:31] that military supremacy is critical for
[23:33] this. Uh you've got quotes here in terms
[23:37] of how important it is. Uh the outcome
[23:40] will depend on how quickly the US can
[23:42] adapt its industrial base, supply
[23:43] chains, military doctrine. Basically,
[23:45] we've been dependent on China. We need
[23:48] to raise things. Go look at what's
[23:49] happened with MP Materials, uh a a rare
[23:53] earth place. This is going to continue,
[23:55] guys. This is not going to stop. Why? If
[23:58] we're going to lose military supremacy,
[24:00] you're not going to see it. So, the real
[24:01] AI race again, America needs more than
[24:04] innovation to compete with China.
[24:06] There's a fear because of our dependence
[24:09] on their supply chains. So, we're going
[24:11] to have to raise the manufacturing side
[24:13] to compete with them. They realize
[24:15] they're going to have to depend less on
[24:17] us from a consumption basis. And that
[24:19] means that they're going to have to
[24:21] increase their domestic demand, which is
[24:23] what is going to happen. So you have
[24:25] both places spending. And at the same
[24:27] time in Europe, Europe needs to increase
[24:29] defense spending because the US is now
[24:31] pulling away from NATO and spending in
[24:33] this. Everything fits towards domestic
[24:36] onshoring and getting going, which means
[24:38] they're spending, the fiscal deficits
[24:40] are there. You see the 30-year yields go
[24:42] higher across the globe, not just in the
[24:44] US, yes, in Japan, and yes, in Europe.
[24:47] So, as you go through this, just go
[24:49] revisions.
[24:51] I talked last week. This is the most
[24:53] important point for me. Here is the PMI,
[24:55] the white line here. Here's what happens
[24:57] to revisions when the PMI goes higher.
[25:01] PMI hasn't gone higher yet, but the
[25:02] revisions are going higher. You've so
[25:04] far seen the revisions go higher because
[25:06] of tech. That is why I talked last week
[25:08] about momentum. At some point here, you
[25:11] are going to have the commodity stuff go
[25:12] higher, too, which has been
[25:14] consolidating. People took down numbers
[25:15] on the tariff situation. Analysts are
[25:17] still worried about the tariff
[25:18] situation. They're still hearing it from
[25:20] some people. That is going to change. So
[25:22] revisions in the US have started to go
[25:24] higher. PMIs will take them higher. The
[25:26] power situation in terms of what we
[25:28] heard from Eric Schmidt, what we've
[25:29] heard from everything. If you just
[25:31] invested in power, here's the white line
[25:32] here. This is the Goldman Sachs power
[25:34] index.
[25:36] This is the PMI that I created, which is
[25:39] the six names that I mentioned. Exxon,
[25:42] Chevron, Freeport, uh, Deer,
[25:46] Caterpillar, Parker, Hannifin. It's
[25:48] lagging behind right now. You're going
[25:49] to need these companies as part of this
[25:51] this buildout of the power situation.
[25:53] You have to look to these meggaap names
[25:56] because the dollars that are flowing are
[25:59] too big for the other comp. All of these
[26:00] companies are going to benefit. Um,
[26:03] terms of the power move. Just look at
[26:04] this weekly performance for this Goldman
[26:06] Sachs power index. This is the
[26:08] realization that has hit in that AI was
[26:11] not slowing down. And so now you're
[26:13] getting all of these companies, the
[26:14] things that I mentioned and from the
[26:15] earnings reports that are coming
[26:17] through, it's very clear beta working.
[26:19] You're hearing you're seeing
[26:20] nonprofitable
[26:22] uh tech companies massively
[26:23] outperforming the MAG 7. This is
[26:26] considered a beta chase. Really, what's
[26:28] happening is when PMIs go higher, tide
[26:30] lifts all boats. This is white line here
[26:33] is pure beta. pure versus pure
[26:36] profitability. Uh again, implying PMIs
[26:40] are going to go higher, but really you
[26:41] have the quant strategies that are
[26:42] moving into things because we're
[26:44] starting to see it. The credit markets
[26:46] are saying the same thing. They've been
[26:47] saying the same thing since 2022.
[26:49] Whenever there's a recession fear, you
[26:51] see the credit. This is inverted. This
[26:52] is junk spreads. Here's the PMI. I fully
[26:55] expect the PMI to be going higher
[26:56] because we have no recession.
[26:59] And we're finally starting to see
[27:01] commodities go. So, the CRB raw
[27:03] industrial market made a new 2 and 1/2
[27:05] year high and getting close to a
[27:07] three-year high as it's got this
[27:10] beautiful rounding bottom base which has
[27:13] gone up. Remember, this was the postcoid
[27:17] period that was as much about uh the
[27:19] supply side as anything. Now, we're
[27:21] getting more into the spending and the
[27:23] demand side. It's been on a lag, but now
[27:24] you're starting to see you've got the
[27:26] Shanghai Composite also correlated to
[27:28] CRB ren making new three-year highs
[27:31] starting to break out. Usually good for
[27:34] commodities. I fully believe China
[27:35] released data this week. All I heard
[27:37] from people was how they are still weak.
[27:40] I want to highlight to you their AI
[27:42] situation and the way they have to be
[27:44] thought of. So their IP rose 6.8%
[27:47] beating expectations and marking the
[27:49] fastest growth since March. The upside
[27:51] surprise was driven by robust
[27:52] performance in several sectors within
[27:54] manufacturing and a broader. All I heard
[27:56] about was the weakness. What is
[27:58] happening though is again things related
[28:00] to high-tech manufacturing
[28:03] machinery.
[28:04] They're building out energy as well. So
[28:07] here's what you have. The white line
[28:08] here is IP year-over-year. Again,
[28:11] bottomed in 22 has been going up. This
[28:14] period is back into the levels it was
[28:16] there. Retail sales way below where they
[28:19] were. So retail sales year-over-year are
[28:22] not happening. So we don't have the
[28:23] consumer. That's what people are focused
[28:25] on. And part of the reason is fixed
[28:27] asset investment in real estate down
[28:29] here, but IP's up here. So again, I've
[28:32] talked about this in the US. If you
[28:33] focus on the housing market in the US,
[28:35] it's going to look like this. If you
[28:36] focus on the commercial real estate
[28:38] market in the US, it's going to look
[28:39] like this. If you focus on the data
[28:41] center side, as I highlighted last week,
[28:43] it's a direct line higher. China has the
[28:46] same situation going on. You have to
[28:48] think in modern terms, not in old terms.
[28:51] That is the wrong way to go. So what was
[28:53] the notable growth product? Forget just
[28:56] going through all this. What really were
[28:58] the outliers for China in terms of the
[29:00] industrial growth? 3D printing up 43%.
[29:02] New energy vehicles up 36%. Uh
[29:05] industrial robots 36%, lithium batteries
[29:08] 53%. China's upside beaten industrial
[29:11] production was mainly driven by
[29:12] equipment manufacturing, high-tech
[29:13] manufacturing, autos and electronics
[29:14] with new energy vehicle. Again, I I I
[29:17] don't know how to make this any clearer,
[29:19] guys. You're going to have to get rid of
[29:20] some of the old things you use as
[29:21] signals. China humanoid ro maker unitry
[29:24] sees significant delivery growth in
[29:26] 2025. And when we say significant,
[29:29] their numbers are getting large. 370,000
[29:32] units in the first six months of 2025.
[29:35] The first six months, that means they're
[29:37] on pace for over 700,000.
[29:40] Production of service robots rode 25.5%
[29:43] to 8.8 8 million units.
[29:47] This is only going to get larger.
[29:49] Robots, humanoids are taking over 3D
[29:52] printing. They had they went through
[29:54] this whole big display in Europe last
[29:56] month. Uh it's a completely different
[29:58] world. And so the commodity side is not
[30:00] the same. But eventually when this raw
[30:02] industrial go higher, it will be because
[30:05] energy goes higher as well. Oil moves
[30:07] higher, this stuff moves higher because
[30:09] the cost of those things goes higher.
[30:11] We're going to start getting into that
[30:12] again uh in my opinion and the market
[30:15] knows it. So when people look at the
[30:17] inflation swap market, I hear a lot of
[30:19] people going well this is you know the
[30:20] Fed's going to cause inflation. The
[30:22] question is is this inflation more about
[30:24] growth in the PMI or is it about what we
[30:27] had seen in the past supply and demand
[30:29] problems on other things like core goods
[30:32] services and everything else too going
[30:34] through from money printing. These are
[30:36] the uh the swap inflation markets. Every
[30:39] single one of them is going higher, but
[30:41] it's being led in particular by
[30:43] two-year, which I think makes sense. But
[30:45] there's important signals from this. And
[30:47] I've shown this chart before, but I'm
[30:48] going to show it again. So, this is the
[30:50] swap curve now, inflation curve. So,
[30:52] this is 2year swap inflation swap versus
[30:55] 10-year inflation swap. So, we're seeing
[30:57] 2-year inflation expectations move
[30:59] higher. This other line here is MAG 7
[31:04] relative to the S&P. It peaked here when
[31:07] we really started to have the transitory
[31:09] move. This is when I think the market
[31:11] accepted that inflation was here and was
[31:12] going to be bad. We bottomed right
[31:15] around the time that we started to see
[31:16] this normalize. We've been going higher
[31:18] in a similar way where they've been
[31:20] going together, but we did peak here. I
[31:22] think the MAG 7 will have trouble
[31:24] because of the spending, but also
[31:26] because I do believe that we're going to
[31:27] have enough inflation fears that the
[31:29] market starts investing differently. So,
[31:31] what trades work? XLE vers XLK. You do
[31:34] not want to be long energy stocks over
[31:37] technology when you have the swap uh
[31:41] curve in negative territory. When it's
[31:43] positive, it's a good time to be in
[31:45] energy. Uh peaked here just before it
[31:47] went down again into negative and then
[31:49] you don't want to be in. We were going
[31:50] higher here and this gets back to the
[31:52] revision side. Energy was outperforming
[31:54] the mag 7 in the beginning part of the
[31:56] year. But this is when liberation day
[31:58] happened. Analysts took down sharply
[32:00] their revisions on the energy sector.
[32:02] I've shown that chart on Exxon on on
[32:04] Chevron. You can go see it for every
[32:06] single part of the commodity based
[32:07] thing. We started building in that the
[32:09] tariff war was going to have a negative
[32:10] shock on on growth and all this stuff
[32:13] came down. It hasn't reversed yet
[32:15] because the tech AI trade has really
[32:17] dominated. Well, I think this thing is
[32:18] going to go higher, which means you're
[32:19] getting this in at a very good point.
[32:20] So, that's XLE over XLK. I like that
[32:23] one. Uh, another one that historically
[32:26] has done extremely well that doesn't get
[32:27] focused on as much, utilities long over
[32:30] staples. So if you want to normalize the
[32:32] defensive side so you don't get hurt if
[32:34] there's recession fears if inflation
[32:36] spikes spikes higher again that's
[32:39] usually good for utilities it's not good
[32:41] for uh staples but most importantly on
[32:44] this particular thing look at what
[32:46] happened from 02 to07 during the China
[32:48] urbanization trade you had a massive
[32:50] move this looks like a great chart uh
[32:52] they've moved together but I think
[32:54] you're going to have utilities over
[32:55] staples I would continue to focus on
[32:57] that space because of the power needs AI
[33:00] I a lot of positive news, new news on
[33:02] AI. I don't know if you guys keep up on
[33:05] this or if you watch this to go through
[33:07] OpenAI or Enthropic new competitor for
[33:11] Bloomberg with new tools on the finance
[33:13] side. I've mentioned perplexity. I'll
[33:14] start using Claude in terms of their
[33:17] finance product. OpenAI agent uh sorry
[33:19] this is uh
[33:22] uh GPT5 and when it's going to start you
[33:25] had Gro 4 come out and then you have
[33:27] this uh introducing chat GPT agent
[33:31] bridging recent just continue to have
[33:33] new products coming out on a weekly
[33:35] basis uh Gro for I've used it for
[33:37] something which I'll hopefully demo soon
[33:39] and talk about. Uh amazing what you're
[33:41] able to do with Gro for already I'm
[33:43] paying for the $300 version. I
[33:45] highlighted this on Pomp that I think
[33:47] parents should be giving their kids the
[33:48] ability to build something from scratch
[33:49] for one month, pay the $300 for one
[33:51] month, invest in them, getting used to
[33:53] it. It is a phenomenal tool that allows
[33:56] you to bypass cursor and all these other
[33:58] places to be able to just speak into it.
[34:00] So, um, the banks were started
[34:03] reporting. I said I wanted go through
[34:05] this in terms of looking for what
[34:06] they're saying on productivity and
[34:07] efficiency. Uh, I'll let you guys kind
[34:10] of read this on on your own, but both
[34:13] companies are talking about how much
[34:15] progress they're already having now and
[34:17] how much is to come. Uh, and that's both
[34:20] Goldman and JP Morgan. Uh, I highlighted
[34:23] this. Goldman claims 90% internal AI
[34:25] penetration significantly ahead of the
[34:27] industry average. The bank sees this is
[34:29] paradigm shift with AI tools expected to
[34:31] unlock 340, yes, that's 340 billion plus
[34:34] revenue opportunity by 2025. Uh both
[34:37] banks stress not just inter incremental
[34:40] improvements but a structural
[34:41] transformation of efficiency. It's a
[34:43] massive thing. I told you JP Morgan has
[34:45] approximately an $18 billion cost for
[34:48] technology. I don't know how much of
[34:50] that is people. I don't know how much of
[34:52] that is coding. Uh but you can see that
[34:54] you will be at a place where they're
[34:55] going to be able to continually get
[34:57] margins when they want them. Uh
[34:59] Goldman's internal reports warned that
[35:01] up to 200,000 investment banking roles
[35:02] globally could face automation within
[35:04] the next 5 years. Not surprising on
[35:06] that. If anything, uh I I don't know how
[35:08] many global investment bankers there
[35:10] are, but 200,000 seems like a pretty
[35:11] high percentage of them. Uh let's close
[35:13] out with crypto week. Big week scores
[35:16] major wins after House passes three CR
[35:19] three key bills. Um again, market
[35:22] structure, stable coin bill,
[35:25] uh and the CBDC, the Fed not doing a uh
[35:29] digital currency. This changes
[35:32] everything. For the first time, the US
[35:33] government is not just tolerating
[35:35] crypto, it's codifying it. the world's
[35:36] largest economy is laying down the legal
[35:38] foundations for digital assets to
[35:40] thrive. This sends a very clear message
[35:42] to markets and to other governments
[35:44] adapt or fall behind. So I I really want
[35:47] to make sure that well I'll wait until I
[35:49] get into the the slide that kind of
[35:51] emphasizes it. But there's a bigger
[35:53] point here for me that fits in with the
[35:54] AI arms race. So what has Bitcoin done?
[35:57] It's doing what it seems to always do.
[36:00] Rally up consolidation. Again, I believe
[36:03] we're in a very, very powerful wave here
[36:05] from an Elliot wave perspective. After
[36:07] we took this high out, fivewave
[36:10] structure, impulsive, new impulsive
[36:13] move, consolidation, uh I would think
[36:15] we're going to head up to 130, pull back
[36:17] again, then be at 140. I'm I'm assuming
[36:19] based on my own count by the end of the
[36:21] month. Uh
[36:23] that will be important. If we do, I'll
[36:25] go through why. But this was not about
[36:28] Bitcoin this week. This has been about
[36:30] Ethereum. I talked about Ethereum and I
[36:31] showed a bunch of things for you to read
[36:33] about. We're approaching a very
[36:35] important technical level at 4,000. I
[36:37] fully expect us to get there uh soon and
[36:39] when we break above it, that's when
[36:41] Bitcoin will be heading to 140. Uh it
[36:43] wasn't just Ethereum this week. You had
[36:45] XRP taking out the highs on the back of
[36:48] the bills that went through taking the
[36:51] crypto market value past 4 trillion. So,
[36:53] this is now expanding in the ecosystem.
[36:56] I've talked about this being the year of
[36:58] the network effects. They're clearly in
[36:59] play. Ethereum has more than doubled
[37:01] since the liberation day uh lows. Trump
[37:05] says Bitcoin could be the greatest
[37:06] financial technology since the internet
[37:09] itself.
[37:11] Using a Mark Andre
[37:14] line, uh Trump said to open 9 trillion
[37:16] US retirement market into crypto
[37:17] investments,
[37:20] approve custody over Bitcoin and crypto.
[37:23] All right. So, I do want to bring up uh
[37:26] that this is another place where it's a
[37:29] race with China and I think you're going
[37:31] to start seeing more and more focus.
[37:32] I've brought up some other things uh as
[37:35] well, but I think now we're getting to a
[37:37] point where the
[37:40] guard rails of the financial system are
[37:42] being set in terms of the rules and
[37:44] benefits by the United States. This is a
[37:46] race for dominance. Again, if they've
[37:48] given up on the global reserve, fiat
[37:50] reserve currency, I don't think they've
[37:52] given up on owning the financial rule
[37:55] rails and innovation. And I think that's
[37:57] what this is about. So, we are going to
[37:59] continue to power forward with the AI
[38:01] side and we are going to continue to see
[38:02] innovation boom on the crypto side
[38:05] for right now. Uh the attention AI is a
[38:08] democratizing event. The crypto side,
[38:11] you want to be invested again in a
[38:13] democratizing uh asset which is Bitcoin.
[38:16] So, I'll keep showing it on here. For
[38:19] those of you who are still not allowed
[38:20] to use AI or invest in crypto, I feel
[38:24] bad for you. But PA wise, you can do
[38:26] this. So, the Chinese have had very
[38:30] large deposit flows into foreign uh
[38:33] deposits. Uh this is the overlay with
[38:37] Bitcoin. So, again, I think the Chinese
[38:39] now are starting to continue to get more
[38:42] involved. Uh, I mentioned that I thought
[38:45] 130 we'd get up to 130. This is 120
[38:49] right now. This is the open interest by
[38:51] strike in Bitcoin calls on Darabit as of
[38:53] Thursday night. Uh,
[38:56] once we get above here, this is where I
[38:58] think there's going to be a short
[38:59] squeeze. So, if this happens quickly, I
[39:02] think we're going to start to get a rise
[39:03] up, but I think this move in particular
[39:06] is going to cause more and more of a
[39:08] short squeeze. There's been a tremendous
[39:10] amount of buying going on. We've seen a
[39:11] lot of selling. I talked about this
[39:13] being like the dot com. I really think
[39:15] we've broken through and we're going to
[39:17] start now seeing the compounding effects
[39:19] where as money is flowing in, it's going
[39:20] to turn into a chase partly by new
[39:22] investors and partly by short covering.
[39:25] Uh that's it for this week guys. Uh,
[39:27] keep enjoying the summer and I'll see
[39:29] you next
