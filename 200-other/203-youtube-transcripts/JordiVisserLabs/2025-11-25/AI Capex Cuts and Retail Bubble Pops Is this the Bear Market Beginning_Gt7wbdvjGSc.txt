--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] another week. Um, all right. For
[00:03] everyone who complained about my banging
[00:06] on the desk last week, we'll try to do a
[00:08] better job with the mic and not have
[00:09] that go on. Uh, for those who reached
[00:12] out on 22V, I know there's been a large
[00:15] crowd. Uh, some of the emails have not
[00:18] been responded to.
[00:20] The goal is by the beginning of January
[00:23] to have a a place on the website site up
[00:27] where people will be able to subscribe
[00:30] and and get whatever they want from this
[00:33] in terms of the different options. One
[00:35] of the things that I I ask all of you
[00:37] who are interested is uh if there's
[00:40] something I do on the video that you
[00:42] want to have uh like people have
[00:45] requested the links to the resources
[00:48] that I put everything together, not just
[00:49] the podcast but the charts and
[00:50] everything. I'm trying to work on that
[00:53] uh as a way for especially the financial
[00:55] advisors and people that have reached
[00:56] out to have some of these charts that
[00:58] they can start using and also have the
[00:59] insights that they can go to and learn
[01:00] on their own. So, we'll get all that
[01:02] done this week. Uh I'm starting with a
[01:05] uh patent and Lombardi quote fatigue
[01:07] makes cowards out of all of us. This has
[01:09] to do with just all of the garbage that
[01:12] has gone on all year which has just
[01:13] worsened. Now uh the market recap retail
[01:17] bubble has popped. Um market rotation is
[01:22] happening and I believe this is a major
[01:24] focus on 2026. It's related to the
[01:26] stimulus uh from the rate cuts and the
[01:29] fiscal side which I'll go through the
[01:31] midterms as I've talked about but also
[01:33] the core announcement which I'll go
[01:35] through cutting capex. Everyone in the
[01:37] AI side that was looking for the first
[01:39] capex guidance cut well we got it. Uh if
[01:42] you didn't hear about it I'll take you
[01:43] through it. Uh next year to me is about
[01:45] capex losers and multiple compression
[01:48] for the AI winners. Be very careful in
[01:50] those names. Pharma will be a major
[01:53] story. Book this. Get ready for it. Uh
[01:57] 2026, in my opinion, will be the year
[02:00] not only of humanoids and robo taxis and
[02:03] things that we've talked about, but it's
[02:05] also now officially, in my opinion,
[02:07] going to be the pharma year. Uh and it's
[02:10] the year that all AI doubts end. We will
[02:12] never again hear that is no adoption,
[02:15] that it's useless technology. Whatever
[02:17] you want to say, this is the year that
[02:18] people realize it is electricity and
[02:21] tokenization plus velocity. Start to
[02:24] understand what tokenization plus
[02:26] velocity is and how it replaces
[02:28] leverage. For though for the macro
[02:29] people on these calls that don't go to
[02:31] the crypto side, I highly recommend you
[02:33] start watching my crypto portion. I
[02:36] expect it to be half of the recordings
[02:40] at some point next year just because of
[02:42] the transition that's going on. So
[02:44] fatigue makes cowards out of all of us.
[02:46] General George Patton, Vince Lombardi.
[02:49] The reason this is important. Uh the
[02:51] market is just I I think everyone has
[02:55] waited for some obvious trade. There
[02:57] hasn't been one all year. And you can
[02:59] see that people are now again after a
[03:02] week where I heard more people and I'll
[03:04] go through one podcast. I was shocked at
[03:07] how negative it was from people that had
[03:09] finally given in and were positive and
[03:12] they became positive around here and
[03:14] since then it's just gone back. So this
[03:16] past week for everyone who's been
[03:18] bullish, everyone who's been bearish, I
[03:20] think fatigue just set in and the fact
[03:23] that everyone's giving up hope probably
[03:24] means we rally into the end of the year.
[03:26] We needed to give up hope and this is
[03:28] across asset classes. This is stocks,
[03:30] this is crypto, this is retail. Um,
[03:32] we've rallied from the liberation day
[03:34] lows in the S&P. We've stayed above the
[03:36] 50-day every single day since we broke
[03:39] out. Uh, the trend is still in place. We
[03:41] broke below the 50-day twice in the last
[03:43] couple weeks and we've still closed
[03:44] above it. We'll see if we actually break
[03:46] down. We could easily head back down
[03:47] towards the 6,500 to 6600 area um over
[03:51] the course of, you know, next week, but
[03:54] I think people need to focus on what's
[03:56] actually going on. Junk spreads, nothing
[03:59] is happening in the economy. So junk
[04:01] spreads are still at all-time types.
[04:03] Earnings are ticking up and this is
[04:05] going to spread next year as I've
[04:07] highlighted into the Russell 2000. You
[04:10] you are going to have a double-digit
[04:11] year next year in the S&P
[04:14] unless something changes and we do not
[04:16] have recessions the way we did in the
[04:18] past. Uh it cannot be bearish if JP
[04:20] Morgan, here's the chart of JP Morgan as
[04:23] of Wednesday of this week, making
[04:25] all-time highs. when there are problems
[04:27] in the market related to anything that
[04:30] will be a problem, the bank stocks in
[04:32] particular JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs,
[04:34] you're covering both the biggest bank in
[04:36] the country and you're right now
[04:38] covering the one that will benefit the
[04:40] most from the M&A, the IPOs and
[04:42] everything that's going on. These things
[04:43] are breaking out and like I said,
[04:45] financials are going to be a major AI
[04:47] beneficiary next year in the profit
[04:48] margins. what has blown up and why
[04:51] people I think are are we've lost the
[04:53] traders, we've lost we lost
[04:54] institutional hedge funds. Uh we've lost
[04:57] everyone now and that's because retail
[04:58] has blown up. The area that was the
[05:00] bubble um energy, you know, nuclear, all
[05:04] of these things that have no revenues
[05:06] that are hope trades far more than
[05:08] humanoids, uh because they're further
[05:10] out and they can easily be disrupted by
[05:12] other things. They all blew up and now
[05:14] you've had a move back. So, we've reset
[05:16] kind of the specs names. Remember, I
[05:17] created this uh this index. Here are the
[05:20] names that are in it. You have a lot of
[05:21] names. You've got the quantum names, you
[05:23] have the Bitcoin miners, you have these.
[05:24] They needed to get the air out. They
[05:26] couldn't go up on uh all on the future.
[05:29] Now that they've reset, for the names
[05:31] out of this group that are actually
[05:33] going to grow earnings, you'll see them
[05:36] go back higher. But for the names that
[05:38] are not going to have earnings next
[05:39] year, as I talked about at the be uh uh
[05:42] on with Pomp yesterday, uh and I'll go
[05:45] through here. I think growth is a factor
[05:47] is about to go through a shift. We'll
[05:48] get through that now to show the impact
[05:50] that retail has. Um it isn't just the
[05:53] spec name. So the white chart here is
[05:55] that spec name. The green side here is
[05:58] Bitcoin. One of the major drivers if
[06:00] you're looking for the uh OG sellers on
[06:03] the sell side for Bitcoin and the buy
[06:05] side. The buy side comes from the
[06:06] velocity from retail who are trading
[06:08] buying call options. They've obviously
[06:11] been losing out over the course of the
[06:12] next month because they're also losing
[06:14] on the spec names. The other side is the
[06:16] institutional um increase the treasury
[06:18] companies and obviously any uh portfolio
[06:22] diversification coming from adding
[06:23] Bitcoin to Black Rockck portfolios,
[06:25] things like that. Those are steady
[06:27] buying, but you get stopouts and this is
[06:29] why the correlation is there. And Oracle
[06:31] was actually the peak of this. So this
[06:33] is the day that Oracle I was at a Robin
[06:35] Hood event. That day Oracle had the 30%
[06:38] up move. It's now given back not only
[06:40] the whole thing but it went down even
[06:43] further. Um this is where we get into
[06:45] what has happened and kind of the thing
[06:47] because I was talking about unwinds. We
[06:49] are definitely at an unwind situation in
[06:52] uh the market that has happened. So
[06:54] first you had the crowded hedge fund
[06:55] longs versus the crowded uh hedge fund
[06:58] shorts. So in September and this is the
[07:01] move I want. You had already had this
[07:03] give up there. This is was from beta and
[07:06] junk outperforming quality that led to
[07:10] an unwind of a trade that had been in
[07:12] place for a long time. Quant strategy
[07:13] seemed to be that part of the unwind.
[07:15] Then we had another part that was here.
[07:17] This seemed to be a combination of quant
[07:18] stuff and long short equity. Uh where
[07:20] you had crowded longs underperforming
[07:22] the short. This was really more about
[07:23] the short side going higher. That
[07:25] stopped in October. But this damage that
[07:27] was here I highlighted. That was the
[07:29] first part. You had a bottom in the in
[07:31] the dollar that occurred right after the
[07:33] Fed cut rates. So that went that's a
[07:36] liquidity drain. We obviously had the
[07:38] shutdown that occurred in early October.
[07:40] Here's the Oracle chart that it peaked
[07:42] here, but then also in midocctober you
[07:44] really got the big wave down in Oracle.
[07:47] Bitcoin early October went down. So the
[07:50] contagion of all of these winners that
[07:52] had been in there, gold peaked. Uh I
[07:55] still see people, it's funny to see
[07:57] macro people say the market's unwinding.
[07:58] you have to be long gold. Uh there's no
[08:01] doubt in people's minds that gold just
[08:03] had a temporary fall. I wouldn't be so
[08:05] sure about that. Um and I'll go through
[08:07] a lot of the reasons why. Uh and then
[08:09] Palanteer was kind of the clincher where
[08:11] they had massive numbers thing opened up
[08:14] and then sold or was trading open uh
[08:16] higher right after the announcement and
[08:18] then just sold off and since then it
[08:20] sold off again and Palanteer's obviously
[08:22] been a major name. Now people look for
[08:24] reasons. They're talking about the Fed.
[08:26] This is the probability. We're down to
[08:28] 50% on the Fed. So these are hawkish
[08:31] statements. So this is an index in
[08:33] Bloomberg that measures kind of dovish
[08:35] to hawkish. So when it's going down,
[08:36] they're more dovish. When it goes up,
[08:37] they're more hawkish. You've had this
[08:39] move higher. Uh again, I don't think
[08:42] this matters because I think the job
[08:44] situation is going to remain on the
[08:46] weaker side and a dilemma for them. Uh I
[08:48] want to bring up France Tran. haven't
[08:50] brought him up uh in a long time and I
[08:52] think part of it is because for a while
[08:54] there there was a lot of stuff that was
[08:57] focused uh on what he has done over his
[08:59] career which was business cycles on the
[09:02] negative side leading to a recession. We
[09:04] clearly had a worsened cycle in terms of
[09:07] PMIs being below 50, but the consumption
[09:10] side still went and the AI side helped
[09:13] with profit margins which fed back into
[09:15] the consumption side. And I think that's
[09:16] the mistake that people have made since
[09:18] 2022 is not understanding the impact
[09:20] that profit margins have had on
[09:22] household net worth and how concentrated
[09:24] it is in the fact that if you get that
[09:26] spending plus capex, it's just really
[09:28] hard for the economy to roll off even if
[09:30] you have no manufacturing, no trade. He
[09:32] put this out in August called Goodbye
[09:34] Momentum, a massive change in leadership
[09:36] ahead. And I want to emphasize this
[09:38] because I like it when people that have
[09:41] been technically right on the cycle and
[09:43] France taught me a lot in my earlier
[09:46] years uh running a hedge fund on ways to
[09:49] use this stuff. He does a lot of leading
[09:51] indicator stuff. I highly recommend this
[09:53] is on YouTube. It's open to everyone. Um
[09:57] he's just highlighting a few things
[09:58] everyone should pay attention to. One is
[10:00] the near-term stimulus from the one big
[10:02] beautiful bill is going to hit in the
[10:04] first quarter. And I think that's
[10:06] important for people to think about
[10:07] because it coincides with this chart
[10:09] which people have not really kind of
[10:11] paid attention to. This one represents
[10:13] more of less the capex side which is the
[10:15] long-term stimulus that's still going
[10:17] through. But the near-term one big
[10:19] beautiful bill. The intermediate term
[10:22] the two-year lag on money supply going
[10:25] higher with the Fed funds rate. So we
[10:28] should expect to see that have an impact
[10:30] in early of next year. And it's not just
[10:32] US cuts. I think it's really important
[10:34] to recognize what has happened. You
[10:36] know, we had all these cuts in 2020 as
[10:38] the economy picked up. Then we had all
[10:40] these cuts leading into 2010. The
[10:42] economy picked up in 09 late or mid 09
[10:45] and then in 2025 there's a lag that goes
[10:48] through it. So, he's highlighted this,
[10:51] even highlighted this chart, um, and
[10:53] referenced Martin Barnes, uh, the
[10:55] originator at BCA from the 1990s, saying
[10:59] the NFIB for small businesses is a gold
[11:02] mine of data. And he's just highlighting
[11:04] what happens to the Russell 2000 in
[11:07] terms of earnings per share
[11:08] year-over-year. So, I've talked about
[11:11] the fact that the Russell 2000 is
[11:13] expected to have significant earnings
[11:15] rise next year and I think that is a
[11:17] broadening out that'll take the PMIs up
[11:18] and everything else with it. Um, this is
[11:22] something to pay attention to. So, just
[11:24] remember this part. Remember PMI is
[11:26] going higher when I highlight this
[11:28] stuff. So, one of the most important
[11:30] trends and what I think is going on and
[11:32] what references back to France and his
[11:34] leadership change. This is pure
[11:37] momentum. That's the white line. And
[11:39] then the orange line is pure volatility
[11:42] relative to pure profitability. So beta
[11:46] over profitability. And what you can see
[11:48] is that for the most part historically
[11:50] these are negatively correlated. So if I
[11:52] flip this over you'd had all of these
[11:55] things that basically would line up. The
[11:58] problem is what we've seen over the
[12:01] course of the last couple years and
[12:03] especially since the Fed cut rates and
[12:06] surprised with 50 basis points is we've
[12:09] seen beta overp profitability
[12:12] actually do well and become part of
[12:14] momentum and remember this momentum is a
[12:17] chameleon factor it's basically whatever
[12:19] has been working so you've ended up in a
[12:21] situation where the AI trades which have
[12:24] won uh think of oracle think of GE EV,
[12:28] Vernov, think of all of these AI trades.
[12:30] They are part of momentum, but they've
[12:33] also been part of beta. Uh, and it's had
[12:37] an impact, especially when you get into
[12:39] some of the smaller names that have
[12:40] worked since April and Junk. So, the
[12:43] fact that these are correlated becomes a
[12:45] worry because these normally shift at
[12:47] inflection points in the business cycle.
[12:49] So, what Francois said was we're going
[12:51] to have a momentum shift and the reason
[12:54] is because the business cycle is going
[12:55] to change. So, a lot of things that were
[12:57] dead are going to go higher. Normally,
[12:59] this happens when you're coming out of a
[13:02] recession. And to me, that is what this
[13:03] is going to feel like because
[13:05] technically we've been in a recession
[13:06] for a good part of the economy. The
[13:08] things that were not in a recession were
[13:10] all related to AI. But now, AIA demand
[13:13] is spreading. This is where Cororeweave
[13:16] becomes important because Cororeweave is
[13:18] one of those kind of idea names even
[13:21] though it hasn't been around that long
[13:23] that theoretically was benefiting
[13:24] dramatically from the AI trade. So I
[13:27] wrote a paper this week after they
[13:29] warned and you can go read this thread
[13:31] that I put on X. When AI demand meets
[13:33] infrastructure reality,
[13:36] that's the name of the piece. The AI
[13:37] boom of 2025 reshaped markets. But the
[13:40] next phase won't be about capital. It's
[13:41] about concrete. We've entered a supply
[13:43] constraint revolution. You have to go
[13:45] read what they said, but I'll give you
[13:47] the uh the headlines. Corewave's latest
[13:50] earnings call made it clear that AI
[13:51] demand is still surging and with
[13:54] requests for compute resources far
[13:57] exceeding current capacity. However,
[13:59] management also called out supply
[14:01] bottlenecks and specifically addressed a
[14:04] major delay in the delivery of
[14:06] PowerShells from a data center
[14:08] developer. Coreweave described demand as
[14:11] insatiable.
[14:13] I want you to think about far exceeding
[14:15] current capacity and demand as
[14:17] insatiable
[14:18] yet the stock fell
[14:22] 16%.
[14:24] The primary bottleneck discussed was a
[14:25] major delay from this that
[14:28] forced cororeweave to sharply reduce its
[14:31] capex expenditure guidance from 20
[14:33] billion down to 12 to 14. So I I I want
[14:35] to emphasize this. I've talked about
[14:37] this actually since the summertime that
[14:39] I expected at some point the reality to
[14:42] set in that all of these RPOS and all of
[14:45] this future orders that had been built
[14:47] into the multiples of the stocks
[14:50] assumed that it would be a smooth
[14:52] movement where they would actually
[14:53] capture this. That is not going to be
[14:55] the case and this is what this did. So
[14:57] for every market trading at a very high
[15:00] PE on the AI trade, I would be very very
[15:04] v uh worried that they're going to have
[15:07] delays in orders not because of demand
[15:10] but because of supply. So this is a very
[15:12] unique situation. Overall core we've
[15:15] described a supply constrained industry
[15:17] and forecast continued robust demand but
[15:19] the company's immediate growth
[15:21] bottleneck is bottlenecked by the pace.
[15:24] That is a unique situation that I think
[15:26] people have to go through. The reason
[15:27] this is important, Kai Woo um only has
[15:29] 10,000 followers. Look at how many
[15:32] people viewed this post, 700,000.
[15:36] He did an excellent job of highlighting
[15:38] things. So, there's an AI investment
[15:40] boom, echoes of past booms. What you
[15:42] notice is he doesn't say AI investment
[15:43] bubble, echoes of past bubbles. Very
[15:45] important in this. This is why I read
[15:47] this kind of stuff. I don't start with a
[15:49] negative. This is a boom. May turn into
[15:51] a bust, but it's a boom. rising capex
[15:54] firms underperform
[15:56] mag 7 the new utility that is something
[15:58] I believe in and I'm looking for reasons
[16:02] and points where the AI winners which
[16:05] are based on the capex winners the
[16:07] semiconductors that could have delays
[16:09] from the data center buildout and then
[16:11] all of the big suppliers which have
[16:13] already had their orders come in gas
[16:15] turbine shortages transformer shortages
[16:18] all of that stuff if you've already
[16:20] built in pees of 40 50 60. I think
[16:23] multiple compression is going to be your
[16:24] story next year. It doesn't mean they're
[16:26] bearish. It just means that the earnings
[16:28] are going to have to flow through before
[16:30] the stocks are going to be able to see
[16:32] when that supply constraint is going to
[16:33] go through. So he highlights just how
[16:35] big these numbers are. So what you have
[16:37] to remember is this is an acceleration.
[16:39] This is exponential capex. We weren't
[16:43] ready for this. So think of the last
[16:45] bottleneck shortage you saw on the
[16:47] supply side. That was CO. So this is a
[16:50] mini version of CO. What happened to the
[16:52] PMIs? They violently went higher. That's
[16:56] what I expect to have happen. They He
[16:58] goes through the echoes of the past and
[17:00] just shows on this how difficult it is.
[17:03] But this is the most important. These
[17:05] guys are rising capex.
[17:08] Evidence from thousands of stocks over
[17:11] multiple decades show that firms
[17:12] aggressively growing capex
[17:14] systematically underperform. Again, it
[17:17] doesn't mean that they are bubbles. It
[17:19] doesn't mean that the capex that they're
[17:21] never going to get their ROIC, but the
[17:23] bar is high. So, these names could just
[17:26] be underperformers for the next decade.
[17:28] And that's something I believe is going
[17:30] to be happening. I think you're already
[17:32] seeing it with Meta, the bigger of the
[17:34] capex names. I think they'll absolutely
[17:36] be some names that are going to be fine.
[17:38] But the more that you're spending,
[17:39] you're making a bet. The higher the bar,
[17:41] the greater the risk. High versus low
[17:44] asset growth stocks. We are leaving a
[17:46] period, guys, where these guys were able
[17:49] to grow their business without debt,
[17:53] without capex. Now, they're needing to
[17:55] take debt and capex. I firmly believe
[17:58] that it's good for the masses, the 493,
[18:01] or at least a lot of them. It is not
[18:03] good for them in my opinion and it's
[18:06] going to make the bar much harder when
[18:08] you add in the fact that everyone is
[18:09] focused on and this is from uh Charlie
[18:13] McKelikott
[18:15] we're really getting provocative for the
[18:16] bears add that blah blah blah tightening
[18:17] backdrop to a world where the AI theme
[18:19] which is stock market begins to lean on
[18:20] credit spreads so I disagree with what
[18:23] he's kind of going through but I think
[18:25] most importantly like $110 billion for
[18:29] this which is mainly Oracle and these
[18:32] companies
[18:32] I mean 20 some odd trillion dollars.
[18:35] Give me a break. I mean the number looks
[18:37] big. It's not tearing down the system,
[18:39] guys. So all of you that are worried on
[18:41] this, I think you're just I I again I
[18:43] think you're looking for reasons to be
[18:44] to be bearish. The free cash flow going
[18:46] down, the debt going up, the capex
[18:49] numbers growing. I do think that that is
[18:52] a negative again for them from the
[18:55] multiple compression standpoint because
[18:56] the bar is higher, but not from the
[18:59] ability for them to uh still post decent
[19:01] earnings. Uh and again, you're going to
[19:03] start people seeing people get more
[19:04] worried. I think this is legitimate in
[19:07] terms of just worrying about how big
[19:09] this stuff is going to be. So, I
[19:11] mentioned the Oracle stuff. They just
[19:12] did, you know, $ 35 billion bond issued
[19:16] a couple months back. they've done
[19:18] announced more uh their bonds are
[19:21] trading down and again they should the
[19:23] probability of them in a default uh
[19:26] scenario and again I don't think this is
[19:28] a problem but if you ask me 5 years from
[19:30] now could Oracle have a problem yes I do
[19:33] believe five years from now there could
[19:34] be a solution and that's why I'm both on
[19:37] the positive side for the next three
[19:39] years because the capex numbers are
[19:42] going to happen demand is massively over
[19:44] supply but once we get past three years
[19:46] and all those dollars are spent and the
[19:48] data centers are up, there's a greater
[19:50] risk for novel solutions from AI. And
[19:53] that's the whole point is you're racing
[19:54] a time of intelligence. And eventually,
[19:56] I do think it will it will cause
[19:58] problems, but only for those names, not
[20:00] for the economy. So, this is the podcast
[20:02] I'm referencing. I'm not going to show
[20:03] which one it was because I like these
[20:05] guys. But I listened to it and I just
[20:07] downloaded the transcript. What's the
[20:09] tone of this podcast? Bearish or
[20:10] bullish? Mostly bearish. So, bearish I
[20:13] am looking for the wheels to fall off.
[20:16] There are a few conditional bright spots
[20:17] like gold strength. This is the thing I
[20:18] mention is that everyone who's a macro
[20:20] person, for some reason, gold's
[20:22] untouchable. Um, but the rest of the
[20:25] market's not. Gold has bubble qualities
[20:27] just as much as uh the other names are.
[20:30] It doesn't have a fundamental story
[20:32] other than debasement. And again, as I
[20:34] get through this at the end, I'm a
[20:36] believer in delever happening. So, and
[20:38] I'm a Bitcoin person, so we'll get
[20:39] through that towards the end. How often
[20:41] do they mention inflation and bubble?
[20:43] This is my favorite thing. Inflation
[20:45] expect it's mentioned roughly 20 to 25
[20:49] times. It's a central argument in the
[20:52] thought. How many are bubble times
[20:53] mentioned? It's referenced around 6 to
[20:55] eight times. Do they ever mention
[20:57] earnings? Yeah, they mention it a few
[20:59] times. They reference retail investors
[21:02] yoloing into quantum computing stocks
[21:04] with no earnings. I just I'm just
[21:07] telling you the ability for people to
[21:09] make up stuff and create a narrative
[21:12] that is a bias that they have. And I
[21:15] want to emphasize where this bias comes
[21:17] from. And I want to just highlight
[21:19] something. Every time someone says this
[21:20] is like the.com bubble. What if the
[21:22] dobomb.com bubble never happened? We'd
[21:25] have no comparison to it. There'd be
[21:27] nothing to talk about. So you're taking
[21:29] one data point and you're making it
[21:31] sound exactly like this is the same. The
[21:33] same thing goes for inflation. If it
[21:36] wasn't for COVID, we'd have no reason to
[21:38] think inflation is going to go higher. I
[21:40] will say it here. Inflation is going
[21:42] down because of the most deflationary
[21:44] force we have ever seen. I will say it
[21:47] again, the do this is not the.com bubble
[21:49] because demand is massively over supply.
[21:52] We do have a bubble in infrastructure
[21:54] spending on the data center side. We do
[21:57] have some kind of risk on the accounting
[21:59] side from the way these guys are
[22:00] handling it, but that's not today's
[22:02] business. So this will continue for the
[22:04] time being and I will say it again. I am
[22:06] bearish on fiat assets in all public
[22:08] stocks as we get to 2030 and believe
[22:11] it's all about time which will go
[22:13] through. So I just want to bring that up
[22:15] because your job is to make money. And
[22:17] if you listen to these podcasts and
[22:18] listen to their narratives about how the
[22:20] world is going to end and inflation is
[22:22] coming and there's a bubble that's going
[22:23] to pop, these are all not going to
[22:26] happen. There are bubbles and it could
[22:29] end at any point, but that's not the way
[22:31] you make money. Let the market tell you
[22:32] when the risk is growing. And I just
[22:34] showed you at the very beginning.
[22:35] Earnings are growing. Credit spreads are
[22:37] tight.
[22:39] Bank stocks are going higher. And the
[22:41] S&P has been above the 50-day. Could
[22:43] there be a scenario that this breaks
[22:44] down? Yes. I highlighted last week that
[22:46] equal weight stocks were making highs,
[22:48] too. Global stocks around the world are
[22:50] making highs. It's not just the US. And
[22:52] we have stimulus coming. It's not the
[22:54] time to be bearish, guys. It's the time
[22:56] to be looking, especially as AI starts
[22:58] to have a massive impact. That being
[23:00] said, society as a whole is not
[23:03] benefiting and that's why you have a
[23:04] K-shaped economy. This is an important
[23:06] chart for next year. Again, get back to
[23:07] the concrete story related to coreweave.
[23:10] Corweave is saying they have supply
[23:12] problems. This is another way to see
[23:15] that it is happening. Mentions of power
[23:17] surged this earnings per year season.
[23:19] We've never seen anything like this
[23:20] except when oil was heading up to 150.
[23:24] This is positive for commodities. This
[23:26] is positive for the buildout. This is
[23:28] positive for hardware, not software.
[23:31] Morgan Stanley sees up to 20% shortage
[23:33] of US power for data centers through
[23:34] 2028.
[23:36] Here's what happened this month so far.
[23:40] Energy materials are up. The S&P is only
[23:43] down 1.55%. You wouldn't think that
[23:45] based on what you're hearing. All of the
[23:46] MAG 7 related names are down.
[23:48] Interestingly enough, on the coreweave
[23:50] side, we have utilities and industrials
[23:52] that are down right now. This is an
[23:54] interesting situation for the time being
[23:57] because the industrials, if I brought
[23:59] transports up, they're outperforming.
[24:01] Transports are more related to materials
[24:03] and energy. The industrials that are
[24:06] down, they're more on the AI buildout
[24:07] where bottlenecks would hurt their
[24:09] earnings next year and bring their
[24:11] multiples down because we don't know
[24:13] when they're going to get it. That is a
[24:14] beautiful rounding chart. And again, it
[24:17] comes at a time when we are being told
[24:19] there are bottlenecks. The last time we
[24:21] had bottlenecks was here. Go back to
[24:24] China and the last commodity thing we
[24:26] had. There were bottlenecks. We couldn't
[24:28] get coal. We couldn't get any of this
[24:30] stuff out. We're seeing signs of it as
[24:32] the commodities are going higher. And I
[24:34] want to remind you this is with oil and
[24:36] natural ga oil down this year 20% and
[24:38] natural gas not moving. Power has not
[24:41] been the story. It's been everything
[24:42] else. Power will be participating. So
[24:44] this is kind of like a late cycle
[24:46] situation. And I wanted to go back to
[24:48] the growth side because I talked about
[24:50] the fact that growth is going to be a
[24:51] problem to me when you have a scenario.
[24:54] And again, this is commodities. This is
[24:58] growth. Now, I put the commodities and
[25:00] inverted them. So, this is that BCOM
[25:02] index. You can see that beautiful kind
[25:04] of rolling situation. Basically, when
[25:07] growth starts to do weak, it's usually
[25:09] when commodities are going higher.
[25:11] Commodities are going higher, at least
[25:12] until here. And you have growth trade
[25:14] not being a great trade. This was back
[25:16] in 2009. This is what happens between
[25:19] the relationship between energy and
[25:21] technology. Technology needs energy. If
[25:24] energy is cheap and technology is having
[25:26] problems and it needs to have more
[25:28] energy, you eventually get that trade.
[25:30] That's the way this is going to go. And
[25:31] so here you have Oracle. They were
[25:34] trading up here. So you're getting
[25:35] multiple compression on Oracle. You've
[25:37] had multiple compression on other loser.
[25:40] Here's Salesforce.com. Salesforce.com is
[25:42] still growing earnings, guys. So the
[25:44] software names are not collapsing
[25:47] because their earnings are going down
[25:48] and they're completely being disrupted.
[25:50] This is why so many people want to buy
[25:51] into software and maybe next year they
[25:53] do outperform semis for a period of
[25:55] time. But the problem is what they're
[25:56] getting is their multiples were in an
[25:58] environment which was wrong. This is the
[26:00] way you have to think about the mag 7.
[26:02] The future of the market is where we're
[26:04] going to be. That's why the multiples on
[26:06] the S&P are actually not too expensive
[26:08] because of profit margins and future
[26:10] profit margins. So in this case, AI will
[26:12] disrupt their business. The way to deal
[26:14] with it is maybe they keep growing
[26:15] earnings, but they're growing earnings
[26:16] at 5 to 10% as opposed to 20 to 30. So
[26:20] you get multiple compression. Same thing
[26:22] goes for Chipotle. Chipotle is being
[26:24] disrupted by AI on the job side. So you
[26:27] had things where this thing was trading
[26:29] as recently as 24 with a 65p. It's still
[26:32] making money, still growing earnings.
[26:35] Adobe still growing earnings, multiple
[26:37] compression. These are important stories
[26:39] to keep in mind. what is traded higher
[26:41] over the course of chat GBT. This is
[26:43] what you want to find. Companies that
[26:45] benefit from AI that have a low multiple
[26:47] going into it. This is a nice smooth
[26:49] repricing up to the same multiples that
[26:51] you saw from the other companies. Nvidia
[26:54] has actually already had multiple
[26:56] compression. That's why I keep saying
[26:57] Nvidia to me is kind of bulletproof. I
[26:59] think you're going to be getting exactly
[27:00] what the earnings growth are. I can make
[27:02] the argument that it's a dirt cheap
[27:03] stock based on 5 years from now and the
[27:05] buildout that's necessary at a minimum
[27:08] as long as Nvidia is reasonable. This is
[27:10] not Cisco. It's still too cheap because
[27:12] it is the Cisco of this and it doesn't
[27:14] have 100 PE. It's had multiple
[27:15] compression. McKessan is another name in
[27:17] the healthc care side that if you
[27:19] invested in it, if you haven't looked at
[27:21] the stock and I wrote about it earlier
[27:22] this year for 22V, McKessan is just a
[27:25] beast. It's up another 50% this year.
[27:28] This is margins. profit margins, profit
[27:30] margins, profit margins in companies
[27:32] that have the ability of using AI.
[27:33] They've gone from an 11PE to 22. You're
[27:36] going to see more of these. If you're
[27:37] fundamental mutual fund, focus on
[27:39] looking for these names that will
[27:40] benefit from AI. Here's one of them.
[27:42] I'll get into this in a little bit. Merc
[27:44] 11P. Expect to see that head up to the
[27:47] 20s over the course of the next couple
[27:48] years. Here's what pharma's done. I I
[27:51] highlighted that healthcare was the best
[27:52] performing sector. Pharma is having its
[27:55] third best performance relative to the
[27:57] S&P since 2001. As of Thursday, before
[28:01] we had a little mild pullback, pharma on
[28:04] an absolute basis was having its second
[28:06] best month since 1999.
[28:09] So, what's going on in pharma? Very
[28:12] important. Eli Liy, look at that chart.
[28:16] So, Trump takes over, the drug stocks
[28:19] sell off. We get kind of a, hey, we'll
[28:21] figure something out on the drug stocks.
[28:23] You get this? That's not the reason why
[28:24] it's going higher. The administration
[28:27] needs lower drug prices. There is a
[28:29] focus that's going on for Eli Liy that's
[28:31] starting to come into a crescendo which
[28:33] everyone needs to pay attention to. Eli
[28:36] Liy continues AI push inking a hundred
[28:38] million plus research pact with
[28:40] Encilico. I highlight this. You can go
[28:43] find I'm going to highlight some
[28:44] podcasts of interviews and things for
[28:46] various things. But if you just go look
[28:47] for the founder of Encilico, go listen
[28:51] to him and you go listen to the CEO of
[28:53] Lily which was on the Cheeky Pint
[28:55] podcast and just go listen to the impact
[28:57] that AI is having on drug discovery and
[29:00] specifically cancer and what we're about
[29:03] to do with trials. So this is a very
[29:05] important deal that happened this week
[29:07] that was part of the reason for the
[29:08] stock being higher. Two weeks ago, Lily
[29:11] partners with Nvidia to build the
[29:12] industry's most powerful AI
[29:13] supercomputers, supercharging medicine
[29:15] discovery and delivery for patients.
[29:18] Drug makers share data to feed voracious
[29:20] foundation models. This is again Eli Liy
[29:23] announces and goes through this whole
[29:24] thing. This has become a big part if you
[29:27] don't know. So there's Eli Liy connected
[29:30] to Encilico. They've been partnered with
[29:32] Encilico in a software deal from two
[29:35] years ago. Now they're expanding the
[29:37] relationship where they're basically
[29:39] implying that clinical trials are about
[29:41] to happen. And that is the inflection
[29:43] point that people need to think about
[29:45] for AI drug discovery. I've I've gone
[29:47] through this with you guys in terms of
[29:49] listening to the Moonshots podcast.
[29:50] They've highlighted this. Getting an AI
[29:52] drug to clinical trial is a massive
[29:55] thing because you're shrinking the cost
[29:57] dramatically both of the time that will
[29:59] be necessary but also the efficacy. So
[30:02] when you do all of that, you're changing
[30:04] the multiples on these companies
[30:06] dramatically and their ability to lower
[30:09] drug prices, which is why deflation is
[30:11] about to happen in the healthcare side
[30:12] for drugs. Will it take a little bit of
[30:14] time? Yes. But will the market start to
[30:16] discount all of that? Yes. Google
[30:18] DeepMind I chief eyes radical AI powered
[30:20] shift in drug discovery speed. Eli Liy
[30:23] Noardis are already on board. This is an
[30:26] earlier this year. They went out and
[30:27] raised 600 million again targeting
[30:30] cancer and immune disorders
[30:33] saying AI designed drugs could
[30:35] eventually turn many cancers into
[30:36] chronic conditions. I want you to read
[30:38] that. I'm going to highlight it many
[30:40] times. We are on the cusp of being able
[30:43] to say that cancer becomes a chronic
[30:45] condition. So for everyone who in there,
[30:48] everyone out there who has had a family
[30:49] member, a friend suffer die from cancer,
[30:52] this is unthinkable and we are now
[30:54] approaching it and you need to spend
[30:56] time thinking about what this does to
[30:58] the stock market, what this does to
[31:00] opinions on AI and everyone that said AI
[31:02] is a bubble and there's nothing there.
[31:04] The government will backs stop AI for
[31:07] military reasons, but they will
[31:08] absolutely do it if it means that drug
[31:10] discovery and everything is going to be
[31:11] there. Keep it in mind when people keep
[31:13] saying to you it's a bubble. It is a
[31:14] disgrace. I will continue to say that if
[31:17] you're going to sit there and spread
[31:18] negative news, it's one of two things.
[31:20] Either you have no idea what you're
[31:22] talking about or you're wealthy and you
[31:23] just want this because you're not
[31:24] participating it. There's no other
[31:26] ground around it. I don't see how people
[31:27] can be arguing about artificial
[31:29] intelligence. Google Deep Mind Boss wins
[31:32] the Nobel Prize. This happened last
[31:34] year. Again, this guy Demisabus won the
[31:37] Nobel Prize for Alpha Fold 3. We are now
[31:40] starting to see the benefits of that. AI
[31:42] developed drugs will be in trials by
[31:44] year end. This is from January. He said
[31:46] this publicly. We're at the end of this
[31:49] year, guys. If you want to go watch an
[31:51] interview with him where he talks more
[31:53] about this, there was a 60-minute one
[31:54] back earlier in the year in the first
[31:57] quarter. I think it was April.
[31:59] Uh he goes through the protein
[32:01] structures and how it did and AI did it
[32:04] 200 million in one year. It would have
[32:06] taken billions of years to accomplish
[32:09] what they accomplished. Billions of
[32:11] years. This is why we're speeding the
[32:13] process up. On average, it takes 10
[32:15] years and billions of dollars to design
[32:16] just one drug. We could maybe reduce
[32:19] that down from years to months or even
[32:21] weeks, which sounds incredible today. If
[32:24] you don't think that's possible or it's
[32:26] in the far distant future, I will show
[32:28] you an example where it's already
[32:29] happened and how a company's stock went
[32:31] up 2,000%.
[32:33] From that exact thing happening, it
[32:35] would revel you human health and think
[32:38] one day maybe we can cure all disease
[32:40] with the help of AI. The end of disease,
[32:42] I think that's within reach, maybe
[32:44] within the next decade or so. I just
[32:46] want you to think about what that means.
[32:48] The end of all disease, extending
[32:49] longevity. How, as a macro person, is
[32:52] this not the most important thing for
[32:55] social security, for entitlements, for
[32:57] all of the expenses we have. If you're
[32:59] getting rid of diseases, go think about
[33:02] how much diseases make up the
[33:03] liabilities of that debt number that you
[33:05] see. Isomeorphic Labs prepares to launch
[33:08] trials for AI designed drugs. Remember
[33:10] what I said? This is back in July.
[33:12] Isomeorphic Labs, which is the Google
[33:14] deep mind um place, prepares to launch
[33:17] trials for AI designed drugs.
[33:20] Isomeorphic Labs sets up US presence
[33:22] with an eye on clinical trials. They
[33:23] hired a chief medical officer in June to
[33:26] prepare for trials this year.
[33:29] Then they spoke at this event back on
[33:31] October 16th. This is the chief medical
[33:34] officer speaking. Oh, what he's speaking
[33:37] about just so I make sure I show AI drug
[33:40] discovery startups partnerships with
[33:42] Lilian Novartis and the promise of AI
[33:44] pharmaceuticals. You can go into uh into
[33:46] perplexity and ask for the details on
[33:48] that conversation.
[33:50] Then Deisabis spoke last month, couple
[33:53] weeks ago, the CEO working to solve
[33:54] cancer. This is an update on where
[33:56] things are.
[33:58] Collaborations with Novartis expanded
[34:01] from three to six targets and Eli Liy
[34:03] are going very well. these relationships
[34:06] refine the platform and validate the
[34:09] commercial potential. Again,
[34:13] this is an impossible thing to think
[34:17] about. It's something I've been waiting
[34:19] for. And again, as you guys get to know
[34:21] me, I keep these in my back pocket. And
[34:24] then when we start to see the movement,
[34:26] like I wrote about Tesla in August, I go
[34:28] through and I listen to see if the
[34:30] leaders are giving hints on podcast
[34:32] about what's coming to get ahead of the
[34:34] event. knowing that stock prices lead
[34:37] narrative. So you want to go figure out
[34:40] the narrative that will be the thing
[34:41] that makes people jump in when that
[34:43] chatbt moment comes because if not when
[34:45] I mentioned Bloom Energy when it was $30
[34:48] to many of you in conversations then it
[34:50] becomes $120 stock, $150 stock because
[34:54] in the exponential age when this changes
[34:56] it goes rapidly. There was an interview
[34:58] with
[35:00] another person from Isomorphic Lab. This
[35:02] is Max Latererberg I think is his name.
[35:04] Uh very important conversation. Again,
[35:06] another Bloomberg one. Uh goes through
[35:10] in terms of uh turning cancer into a
[35:13] chronic but livable disease where they
[35:14] get into the specifics. Isomorphic
[35:17] already has multiple molecules advancing
[35:19] through pre-clinical development with
[35:21] many earlier programs showing strong
[35:23] promise. Collaborations with Nardis and
[35:25] Eli Liy target previously undruggable
[35:28] proteins. Think about that. That's where
[35:30] the cancer stuff comes in. Previously
[35:32] undruggable proteins and they're showing
[35:34] early success over the next decade. AI
[35:37] could compress discovery from four years
[35:39] to months transforming medicine into a
[35:41] personalized. When you're trading at an
[35:43] 11p, you are not building in the
[35:45] possibility of this. I bring that up
[35:47] because Merc is sitting down there and
[35:49] you can go type in merci drug
[35:51] development and get very similar things
[35:53] just not as advanced as Eli Liy. Sequoa
[35:57] had an interview with Max again earlier.
[36:00] Now Max used to be part of the Google
[36:01] DeepMind team. He's part of the
[36:02] isometric labs. It's very interesting to
[36:04] go listen to what's going on and what
[36:06] they did. Again, internal focus on
[36:08] oncology and immunology partnerships
[36:10] with Eli Liy and Novartis tackle decade
[36:13] hard targets. Novartis expansion cited
[36:15] as validation. They're basically telling
[36:17] you that they're making significant
[36:19] advancements. There's a clinical trial
[36:21] that's coming up. You can go read all
[36:24] these on your own. The macro and market
[36:26] implications. Clinical trials mark
[36:28] capital markets inflection point.
[36:30] Potential reallocation of capital
[36:32] towards AI native drug discovery
[36:34] platform. Structural shift in healthcare
[36:35] economics from acute to chronic care.
[36:38] Could make AI and biotech the
[36:40] semiconductors of health care. Expands
[36:42] human capital through longer healthier
[36:44] lives. Could reshape fiscal and
[36:45] productivity models as healthcare cost
[36:47] dynamics change. Think about the trades
[36:49] that came out of OMIC. This is far
[36:52] bigger than Ozmpic.
[36:55] This is the relationship now. So I
[36:57] mentioned isomorphic is Google deepmind.
[37:00] They're the biological intelligence
[37:02] layer. Encilico is the drug engineering
[37:05] layer. And Eli Liy clinical regulatory
[37:08] and commercialization layer. So let's go
[37:10] here. The brain is isomorphic. The hands
[37:13] for the engineering are in silicone. And
[37:15] the body is Eli Liy. They're the
[37:18] manufacturing plant. This is the thing
[37:20] that takes drugs discovery from 10 to
[37:22] two years to two to three. developmental
[37:24] costs could fall by 70 to 90%. That is
[37:27] called profit margins. That allows drug
[37:30] prices to move lower, which again is
[37:32] what the administration wants, what all
[37:34] administrations wants. So this will be
[37:37] supported by the government and all
[37:39] capital and money that has been moving
[37:41] into other areas with inside healthcare
[37:43] will quickly move to help support this
[37:46] stuff. So you just have to realize there
[37:48] how important is getting to the first
[37:50] clinical trial as a proof of concept?
[37:52] It's crossing the Rubicon.
[37:54] You can go through it. Economic
[37:56] validation. And I think this is
[37:58] important because there will be a
[38:00] rerating in companies. And this is what
[38:03] happened with Oracle. Oracle goes from a
[38:06] boring company. What happens to IBM? It
[38:08] goes from a boring company. AI is a rer
[38:11] guys. When you get something and your
[38:13] cost can go down, you have to expand the
[38:16] multiple dramatically. Go look at
[38:18] healthcare and pharma and go do your
[38:20] homework. Evidence. Since we are close
[38:22] and Silicico's publicly announced its
[38:24] lead programs, is already in phase two
[38:26] trials. I don't need to go read all
[38:29] this. They've been staying very close on
[38:30] all of this and they hired a chief
[38:32] medical officer.
[38:34] Here's Google stock. Telling you, I
[38:36] already showed you Eli Liy. Google stock
[38:38] looks like something's going on. Noartis
[38:41] looks like something's going on.
[38:43] Merc [snorts] doesn't look like that.
[38:45] Those companies do. Here's the
[38:47] comparison. Maderna versus isometric
[38:49] labs vaccine was designed in
[38:51] approximately two days after the COVID
[38:54] genome release entered human trials 63
[38:58] days later approved for emergency use in
[39:00] 11 months. Now obviously cancer drugs
[39:02] won't go this fast but the main point is
[39:08] it was supposed to take
[39:11] 10 to 15 years to it took it from 10 to
[39:13] 15 years to two to four years in terms
[39:16] of what isometric labs will do to drug
[39:18] discoveries in this case remember we
[39:21] were hearing it's 8 to 10 typical we'll
[39:23] get it done in four years it came out 11
[39:24] months mader cut one order of magnitude
[39:29] isomorph is about to get rid of another.
[39:32] And here's what happened to their stock.
[39:33] This is the 2000 price. It went from
[39:36] this to $200 billion at this point. All
[39:40] because of artificial intelligence.
[39:44] I want to get back to the economy to
[39:45] finish this up and move into crypto. Car
[39:47] loan delinquencies hit record for
[39:49] riskiest borrowers.
[39:51] K-shaped economy. You can see that the
[39:53] lowest wage cortile is going down. Hence
[39:56] the problems that are happening in the
[39:58] cities. the uh the need for uh
[40:03] socialism. Uh you've got this is from
[40:06] Torston Sllock from Apollo. Uh you've
[40:09] got basically this K-shaped economy
[40:12] which is a reality and it's still
[40:14] worsening.
[40:16] And so what is the administration going
[40:18] to do? Well, they admit the GOP was
[40:20] blindsided by the economy fears as
[40:22] Democrats sweep Keys. Republicans don't
[40:24] talk about the word affordability. Okay.
[40:26] Trump is committed to $2,000 tariff.
[40:30] Sounds a little bit like socialism.
[40:31] Trump's 50-year mortgage would save you
[40:33] about 109. Okay, so 50-year mortgage. Uh
[40:36] the Trump administration is actively
[40:38] evaluating portable mortgages. Whether
[40:40] it's a handout that's coming from people
[40:42] voting for handouts or whether it's some
[40:44] way to go through the printing. This
[40:46] continues the transfer payment need. You
[40:48] have to in a K-shaped economy being
[40:50] disrupted by AI continue to do things to
[40:52] keep the economy from falling off and
[40:55] also to try and win votes. Republican
[40:57] party has the right right solutions to
[40:59] the affordability issue.
[41:02] The White House needs to act on
[41:03] healthcare affordability. Basically, I'm
[41:05] only bringing this up because when you
[41:07] combine that with the Fed needs to do
[41:09] something on QE because the liquidity
[41:10] situation, they've already ended QT.
[41:13] When you have a deficit and a debt of
[41:15] this magnitude, even though I believe AI
[41:19] will have impacts on this down the road,
[41:21] for the near term, they are going to
[41:23] continue to print money. Inflation will
[41:25] stay above 3%. The deflationary forces
[41:28] will come through over the next three
[41:30] years. We'll have a probably a peak at 3
[41:33] point something% and a bottom at 3 point
[41:35] something% for the next couple years. If
[41:37] oil goes higher, we'll get slightly
[41:38] above four. I don't think that's going
[41:40] to happen in in a major way. The main
[41:42] point is we're still printing money.
[41:45] This gets us to all of you crypto
[41:48] people. I know you're fatigued, but it
[41:52] makes cowards of all of us. Just stick
[41:54] with the program. And here's a reminder
[41:57] from Jordy.
[41:59] We do trade with retail trading. It's a
[42:01] big part of it. The OGs are selling for
[42:03] ideological reasons, which makes sense
[42:05] to me, and diversification. the buyers
[42:08] are not as big as the OG sellers and the
[42:10] traders which kind of drive the
[42:11] volatility have been frustrated in
[42:13] buying against this brick wall for a
[42:16] while. So when the spec names go down
[42:17] and they start losing money, well,
[42:20] Bitcoin's still going to go down with
[42:21] it. But we have the clarity now that the
[42:25] shutdown's over, expect to see the
[42:27] Clarity Act done hopefully before the
[42:29] end of the year, maybe even sooner. And
[42:32] remember the longevity piece. I'm going
[42:34] to remind you of Rick Edelman. The
[42:36] traditional 6040 stock bond allocation
[42:38] model is dead due to unprecedented rates
[42:40] of longevity brought around by
[42:41] remarkable advances in exponential
[42:43] technologies.
[42:45] I think the MAG 7 are not investable in
[42:48] the long term as a group. There may be
[42:51] some winners in it, but I think the
[42:53] competition from AI and the capex spend
[42:56] and the debt that they need to do it
[42:57] makes them vulnerable. Where are you
[42:59] going to find a large asset and
[43:01] innovation that is growing rapidly that
[43:04] is going to fit into Bitcoin and the
[43:06] crypto world? JP Morgan rolls out
[43:08] deposit token. JP Morgan coin and
[43:10] digital asset push. You're getting the
[43:11] banks there. Here's what you need to
[43:13] listen to. The state of crypto 2025.
[43:17] This was a podcast that came out from
[43:19] A16Z to go through their state of the
[43:21] 2025 on crypto to show everything that
[43:24] has happened, everything that's going
[43:26] on. I know you're fatigued. I know
[43:28] Bitcoin is basically unchanged this year
[43:30] now. But again, it was after 200 plus
[43:33] percent years. So, it was even
[43:35] outperforming itself.
[43:37] Let's just take a little time, take a
[43:39] little breath, and just go through all
[43:41] of the details that are on there. The
[43:43] only thing I want to get into, and
[43:44] you'll hear me talk more about this with
[43:46] Pomp. I talked about it with Natalie
[43:47] Brunell this week that'll get released.
[43:49] There's a lot of conversations I'm doing
[43:51] connecting tokenization to stable coins,
[43:54] also to prediction markets. This is the
[43:56] future. This is why macro people need to
[43:58] be paying attention.
[44:01] Here's the belief in terms of what's
[44:04] going on. They bring up the developing
[44:06] market activity and the developed market
[44:08] activity. So the developed market
[44:10] activity, think the US, South Korea,
[44:12] Australia, Western Europe, participation
[44:13] is mostly trading and speculation.
[44:15] Younger retail traders, they're
[44:17] interested in the volatility. Emerging
[44:18] economies, which are another one,
[44:21] they're dominated by the data for mobile
[44:23] wallet usage. This is the ultimate most
[44:26] important buyer. The 7.5 billion people
[44:30] that are not part of the capitalist
[44:32] system that live in countries where they
[44:34] don't trust the government and they want
[44:36] another solution. Stable coins allow
[44:38] them to get wallets. Wallets allow them
[44:40] to make instantane instantaneous uh
[44:44] asset allocation. Once wallets are open,
[44:47] Bitcoin gets a part of it. This all fits
[44:49] into the state of crypto. So, I'll go
[44:51] through the report.
[44:53] Look at this financial institutions.
[44:55] This is all this year. I just want to
[44:57] make sure you realize all of the stuff
[44:59] basically is going on this year in terms
[45:01] of the pressure for this. You never
[45:02] thought you'd see JP Morgan on this
[45:04] list. Um
[45:06] advancements in terms of the
[45:08] institutional side, the institutional
[45:09] capital, despite all of the weakness and
[45:11] all of the selling from the OG sellers.
[45:14] Here's the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.
[45:16] $178 billion. Now, there's been hundreds
[45:20] of billions of dollars of OG sellers.
[45:22] That's why we're stuck. The money keeps
[45:24] coming in and will continue to come in
[45:25] because the allocation for this group is
[45:28] close to zero for most people. Financial
[45:30] advisors and banks are now getting
[45:32] people in, but they do it slowly. The
[45:34] same thing goes for this. You have, yes,
[45:36] Treasury buyers are going in. Micro
[45:39] Strategy owns almost all of it. I keep
[45:40] hearing that all these other numbers.
[45:42] There's 73 billion of it. So, the rest
[45:45] of it is very tiny.
[45:49] This is what's happening in stable
[45:50] coins. they're breaking their
[45:51] correlation with the broader trading
[45:53] volume. So, the crypto trading is still
[45:54] in a bare market. It's very hard. You've
[45:57] had you get these upswings, the price
[45:59] goes higher. This is when you end up
[46:01] getting the rally leading into the
[46:03] election. But then since then, crypto
[46:04] has been kind of in a bad place. But
[46:07] stable coins, which are the network
[46:08] effect engine, are growing rapidly.
[46:12] Stable coins are no longer niche. Major
[46:14] public companies are actively evaluating
[46:16] opportunities. These are the related
[46:18] mentions in SEC filings. So stable coins
[46:20] are growing,
[46:23] crypto is global, but onchain activity
[46:26] is growing fastest in developing
[46:28] countries. This is a major part of the
[46:30] positive side of it. It will be there.
[46:32] Just be patient. You'll get the payoff
[46:34] eventually. Uh stable coins now rival
[46:37] the world's largest payment networks in
[46:38] transaction volume. This is where I'm
[46:40] going to start to get into some really
[46:41] important stuff to finish off. They are
[46:44] rivaling the largest payment networks.
[46:46] We are quickly coming into the AC and
[46:48] with Zel's announcement and with the
[46:50] roll out we will be way above it. And I
[46:53] want to give you one other slide from
[46:55] there. Real world assets are bridging
[46:56] traditional finance and there's already
[46:58] 30 billion online tokenization.
[47:02] Real world assets. This is really
[47:04] critical
[47:06] to where we're going. And I'm going to
[47:08] bring you back to an interview from
[47:10] Caitlyn Long who I've shown before on
[47:12] this. Kaitlyn is a genius when it comes
[47:14] to the importance of stable coins and
[47:17] connecting it to banking and connecting
[47:18] it to the global economy and GDP. I'm
[47:21] not sure she knows the uh the connection
[47:25] and the genius that she's had on this,
[47:27] but everyone needs to realize velocity
[47:30] of money connected to the tokenization
[47:33] of assets. I hear a lot about dormant
[47:35] coins in Bitcoin. You know where there's
[47:37] more dormant activity? Let's just take
[47:41] housing equity in the US. That's dormant
[47:43] activity that can't be released. If it
[47:45] could and people could spend the money,
[47:47] the equity they have without having to
[47:48] go to the bank, without having to lock
[47:50] in a high interest rate, but could
[47:53] actually just do it from transactions.
[47:56] You'd have a lot more GDP because at the
[47:58] end of the day, the money velocity is
[48:00] going to drive GDP. And that's what
[48:02] Caitlyn talks about with the importance
[48:04] of velocity.
[48:06] She is widely quoted as discussing the
[48:08] implications of tokenization and stable
[48:10] coins on financial velocity in capital
[48:12] markets. So what's happening is you can
[48:14] get velocity through technology. Think
[48:16] AI agents. It used to be that you got
[48:19] velocity through leverage. That's the
[48:21] current fiat system. Deleverage replaced
[48:25] with velocity. That's the world we're
[48:27] going into. Everyone on the macro side
[48:29] that is having their brain kind of uh go
[48:31] through a little thing of not
[48:33] understanding it. go spend some time on
[48:35] what happens to leverage if it's
[48:36] replaced from just transactions. We
[48:38] actually get delever of a lot of the
[48:40] dormant things that will drive asset
[48:43] prices lower over the long term, not in
[48:46] collapsing the market because you'll
[48:47] replace it with velocity. I think what's
[48:50] going to happen is all of this is just
[48:52] going to delever the banking system
[48:54] across the board because we don't need
[48:55] to get velocity through leverage
[48:57] anymore. We'll get velocity through
[48:59] technology. It's a really important
[49:01] point.
[49:03] Money is like oil in the engine of the
[49:06] economy. It doesn't produce output by
[49:08] itself, but it makes the system grow
[49:10] faster and move more smoothly. The
[49:14] faster it circulates, the more
[49:15] powerfully it fuels growth. This is
[49:17] Milton Friedman. Milton Freeman taught
[49:19] that money's true power lies not in its
[49:21] quantity, but in its motion. In the
[49:23] digital age, tokenization restores that
[49:25] motion, turning capital from a store of
[49:27] value into an engine of growth.
[49:29] Tokenization plus velocity turns dormant
[49:31] assets into circul circulating energy,
[49:34] unlocking trillions in trapped value and
[49:37] accelerating the digital economy through
[49:39] network effects. Crypto and the digital
[49:41] economy will grow rapidly over the
[49:43] course of the next three years with this
[49:45] administration supporting it, but also
[49:47] with the advancements that are coming.
[49:48] We have ended a dotcom bubble of crypto.
[49:52] Bitcoin has gone sideways. Stable coins
[49:54] have continued to go higher. The clarity
[49:56] act when it comes in will speed up
[49:57] tokenization. The value of bitcoin just
[50:02] like the value of pharma just like the
[50:04] value of oracle just like the value of
[50:06] maderna should go higher based on the
[50:08] future when it's exponential and that
[50:10] future is getting closer. So I leave you
[50:13] guys with this to go think but just
[50:15] don't get too bearish because we're on
[50:17] the cusp of some major things and I
[50:19] didn't even mention humanoids. Have a
[50:21] great week guys. I'll see you next week.
