[00:00] is a uh a lot going on a lot's changed
[00:03] uh I'm going to cover a lot of things
[00:05] today uh so it's probably going to be
[00:07] more like 45 minutes instead of the
[00:09] usual 25 to 30
[00:11] um there's a huge shift that's happened
[00:15] um almost in in in a week even though
[00:18] we've talked about a regime shift since
[00:19] early December uh starting with
[00:23] inflation surprising and starting to see
[00:25] weakness in Tech and higher valued names
[00:28] got into the beginning of the New Year
[00:30] we saw continuation of it with Europe
[00:32] and China doing well and outperforming
[00:34] the us but over the course of the last
[00:38] two weeks in particular but I would say
[00:41] four weeks once the tariffs started to
[00:43] come in and people didn't believe they
[00:44] they were going to happen uh I didn't
[00:46] believe that they would be willing to
[00:48] sacrifice the stock market that's what's
[00:51] changed so as we go through this the
[00:53] first line there will be pain and no
[00:55] Trump and you can't see it here says put
[00:59] so no Trump put uh stocks break down on
[01:02] the back of that zelinsky's oval off
[01:05] Oval Office meeting Fallout uh is
[01:07] something that I'm not hearing a lot of
[01:09] people talk about but it had a huge
[01:10] impact on the markets this week and in
[01:13] particular after I get through the
[01:14] recession fears Rising hedge fund
[01:16] deleveraging the market is repositioning
[01:19] for a very different world that they
[01:21] envisioned as of December um and that's
[01:23] what's really been I would say the major
[01:25] story of the week and then I'll go
[01:27] through something that just isn't
[01:29] getting a lot lot of press at this point
[01:31] because I think people were hoping
[01:32] there' just be an announcement to buy
[01:33] but the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh
[01:35] with the summit at the white house uh
[01:38] went on so I'll go through all of that
[01:41] um but to start uh I have uh joined 22v
[01:46] to provide Deep dive research nothing's
[01:49] going to change with the video nothing's
[01:51] going to change with my substack I'm
[01:52] still going to do those but through 22v
[01:55] if anyone's interested they can reach
[01:56] out to them I will be doing deep dive
[01:58] research focused on the impact of the AI
[02:02] on macroeconomics and ways to invest in
[02:04] it uh I'll also probably be doing some
[02:07] other things on there eventually uh more
[02:09] geared towards the trading side but for
[02:10] now uh if you're an institution or if
[02:13] you want to uh work with them uh give
[02:15] them a call I've known them a long time
[02:17] they're great guys secondly uh Anthony
[02:20] Pompano and I uh started doing a
[02:23] weekly kind of recap uh just on what's
[02:26] happened from our perspective uh Anthony
[02:29] and I both believe this is a huge uh
[02:32] year with the administration taking over
[02:34] for Bitcoin but my view again as I've
[02:37] said to you is that this is the
[02:38] beginning of a massive transition away
[02:41] from what has been a dominant theme in
[02:43] technology and specifically the mag 7
[02:46] and that the combination of AI As A
[02:48] disruption to the adoption phase where
[02:52] it's going to be a disruption to
[02:53] centralized stocks centralized locations
[02:56] and I believe we're seeing that and
[02:57] that's one of the reasons why we're
[02:59] seeing the US under perform uh I think
[03:01] this will continue and I think the mag 7
[03:03] is going to have a hard time at the same
[03:05] time we're starting to see another thing
[03:06] that I believe that would happen which
[03:08] is I believe we're in the beginning of a
[03:10] very large and significant change in
[03:12] hedge fund investing and I'll go through
[03:14] a lot of the reasons why here but again
[03:17] this is an AI disruption and what you're
[03:18] going to be left with at the end of the
[03:20] year is a new alternative and a new uh
[03:23] High beta investment which is going to
[03:25] be Bitcoin so Bitcoin is going to be the
[03:26] end result this year uh I believe for
[03:28] those people that are looking for an
[03:30] entry point as I go through this I
[03:32] really think we're at it now I
[03:33] highlighted last week some divergences
[03:35] from a technical basis uh so Anthony I
[03:38] will be doing that each week it'll get
[03:39] dropped on Saturday I highly recommend
[03:41] you go through it he's a great guy but
[03:42] more importantly between the two of us I
[03:44] think we've uh we're good combination of
[03:46] kind of looking at the markets and
[03:47] talking about things he's obviously
[03:49] completely connected into the crypto
[03:51] space uh I'm more so from the
[03:53] macroeconomic space it's a good bridging
[03:55] and for those people looking to learn
[03:56] more about uh crypto or macroecon ICS
[04:00] that are more focused on crypto I think
[04:01] it's a great bridging um all right so
[04:03] quickly us markets down NASDAQ is now
[04:07] down 6% year today S&P is down two and
[04:09] you can see the rest of the globe hangs
[04:11] hang up 21 Europe up between 10 and 15
[04:15] uh this Divergence again is more about
[04:18] people repositioning and what you can
[04:21] see here is bond yields this is 10year
[04:24] yields this year you can see that for
[04:26] the week look at these movements in
[04:28] terms of 10year bond yields uh sorry for
[04:31] three months versus the U versus the US
[04:34] so us three Monon Yi uh three Monon
[04:36] change in yields are up 10 basis points
[04:39] uh and they're below the midpoint of the
[04:41] range Europe all on the highest they've
[04:44] been and they're up between 6884
[04:46] depending on which one you look at uh
[04:49] it's a big shift that's happening
[04:50] there's a reason for and I'll go through
[04:52] it uh this is really the big story so at
[04:55] the what would be the the address before
[04:57] Congress he tells America that tariffs
[04:59] are worth the economic pain um so he's
[05:02] basically telling everyone he's going to
[05:03] do tariffs um Besson came out and I've
[05:06] never seen this before but he said there
[05:08] is no Trump put uh warning that the
[05:11] markets are going to be hit and that's
[05:14] part of what they're doing um he also
[05:16] said tariff policy can Finance income
[05:18] tax and income gains for the bottom 50%
[05:20] of wage earners this is a major theme
[05:23] that comes out think of it as Main
[05:24] Street versus Wall Street I'll get into
[05:26] a lot more of that uh new Gingrich Trump
[05:29] is really increasingly convinced of the
[05:30] McKinley model High tariffs lead to
[05:32] massive Capital Investments leading to
[05:34] high paying jobs uh I don't agree with
[05:37] this but it doesn't matter you're in
[05:38] here regardless of what the you believe
[05:40] should be done or should not be done we
[05:42] are here to make money we are here to
[05:44] invest and I think this is a dramatic
[05:46] shift on what had been going on and
[05:47] again bessent it's a focus on Main
[05:50] Street wall stre wall Street's done
[05:52] Great Wall Street can continue to do
[05:53] fine but we have a focus on small
[05:55] business and consumers we are going to
[05:57] rebalance the economy short-term pain is
[05:59] their plan so I just want to highlight
[06:03] what they're trying to do and give you a
[06:05] perspective so the budget deficit you've
[06:07] probably or the fiscal deficit you've
[06:08] heard is down around 6 and a half to 7%
[06:11] um that means we're funding the
[06:13] government with excess debt we have a
[06:15] debt problems so they're trying to get
[06:16] this back to zero this is the big thing
[06:18] Ralia is out there saying if they don't
[06:20] get it back there within the next three
[06:21] years there's going to be huge problems
[06:23] I think he said a heart attack for the
[06:24] market um the problem with that is we
[06:28] have an issue here of how big the debt
[06:30] is so that they don't want this going
[06:32] any higher but my problem is when you're
[06:34] trying to fix the deficit and you're
[06:36] saying you want the stock market to go
[06:38] down I just want you to highlight
[06:39] because people keep bringing up that
[06:41] this is going to be Reaganomics
[06:43] 2.0 uh to some degree you're following
[06:45] it with the deregulation but this was a
[06:48] very different scenario in 1982 in terms
[06:51] of where debt to GDP was so Reagan
[06:54] actually took advantage of the fact that
[06:56] he could spend and he was spending
[07:00] they're trying a different method with
[07:01] it up here and they're using austerity
[07:03] whether it's through the form of getting
[07:04] rid of federal workers Alan mus trying
[07:06] to find ways not to spend we have a
[07:08] spending problem which means austerity
[07:11] it's very dangerous when you have debt
[07:12] to GDP at this level to try austerity um
[07:16] it's not an easy thing to get out of and
[07:18] part of the reason is because of this uh
[07:20] so in 1982 here's the other thing that
[07:23] was different this is where the stock
[07:25] market cap relative to GDP was it was
[07:28] down at 40 some 40% it's now up at 200%
[07:33] this is the total value of the stock
[07:35] market over GDP so back here we were at
[07:39] around 40% to give you an idea Germany
[07:41] right now which is ripping is about 60%
[07:44] we're at 200% which means our Market our
[07:46] economy has become the stock market this
[07:49] is house prices overlaid with the S&P
[07:51] 500 so if the s&p500 if they're willing
[07:54] to make this come down here as part of
[07:57] the pain this the housing Market's going
[07:59] to follow there's just no other way
[08:00] around it it's not going to sit there
[08:02] and go higher uh I think it's going to
[08:04] have an impact on jobs too but they want
[08:06] it lower because of this home price to
[08:08] median household income back in 1982
[08:11] again it was around 4 to1 now we're up
[08:13] here this is where the housing bubble
[08:14] was so it's people can't afford housing
[08:17] so the attempt makes sense and I I don't
[08:21] think it's it's going to be able to work
[08:22] if the stock market goes down I'm I'm
[08:24] fairly certain of it uh they're going to
[08:26] try to navigate this and thread it but
[08:28] here's what he said the market market
[08:29] and the economy have become hooked
[08:31] become addicted to excess government
[08:33] spending and there's going to be a detox
[08:35] period the government is telling you to
[08:37] be careful in the market so this is a
[08:39] very different situation than we've seen
[08:41] in the market and the only thing I can
[08:42] compare it to is back here this is um
[08:46] back in 2022 Jerome pal right here gave
[08:49] a speech where he told the market there
[08:51] will be pain he wants the unemployment
[08:53] rate to go higher and the market
[08:55] proceeded to fall 177% after he said
[08:58] that um in this case you would had a
[09:00] rally beforehand this time where Trump
[09:02] said this the market has already fallen
[09:04] so as I go through this we hit support
[09:06] here on the 200 day moving average we
[09:07] had a nice reversal Day on on uh on
[09:10] Friday uh I do think we're going to get
[09:12] a bounce here in the market purely
[09:14] because the sentiment has got so done
[09:15] and at least now they've told everyone
[09:18] there's going to be pain so at this
[09:19] point it's no longer a surprise so a
[09:21] bounce just to screw people uh because I
[09:24] will think it I think it will hurt
[09:25] people as I go through the hedge fund
[09:27] component uh so that's it in terms of
[09:29] the
[09:30] macd we're just this is as ugly as it
[09:32] gets I think we're going to continue to
[09:34] see a selloff in the market um I'm going
[09:36] to guess we're going to come somewhere
[09:38] into this area before we're completely
[09:40] done it could overshoot in my opinion
[09:43] and get down here but a lot of that
[09:44] depends on the tariffs um he still has
[09:47] been showing signs of not wanting to do
[09:49] too much damage so you got to play the
[09:52] game based on what's going on as long as
[09:53] tariffs are in place until we can get
[09:56] through this and the economy can adjust
[09:58] I think it's going to be difficult they
[09:59] want rates lower they're getting it they
[10:01] want oil lower they've gotten it uh the
[10:04] dollar is lower I think they want that
[10:05] they've gotten that so there's some
[10:07] positives going on and I've said this
[10:09] before I am not worried about a
[10:10] recession I think Ai and AI agents are
[10:12] the story they're taking a risk at this
[10:15] time which I think they want but I think
[10:17] the closer we get to the midterms the
[10:19] harder it is to do this so I think they
[10:20] need the maximum amount of pain in the
[10:22] first three to six months if that's
[10:24] truly what they're trying to do uh in
[10:25] terms of the mag S I just wanted to
[10:27] highlight this so the mag seven this
[10:30] Arrow here is that we have this 125
[10:33] exponential moving average turning down
[10:36] for the first time since back here so we
[10:39] are at a point now where I would expect
[10:41] again a bounce in the mag 7 but as I've
[10:43] said before the mag 7 to me is going to
[10:45] be the major story for this year I don't
[10:47] think I think it's going to underperform
[10:49] uh the market as a whole I definitely
[10:51] think it's going to underperform bitcoin
[10:53] I think this looks very toppy here and I
[10:56] think you could get down to lower levels
[10:58] in this area if you break this I think
[11:00] it's going to take a long time for it to
[11:01] go back higher I don't think this is the
[11:03] place to go buy for some big beta bounce
[11:06] or anything so I think that is a problem
[11:08] the mag 7 has uh has started a trend
[11:11] change and at a minimum I think it'll
[11:12] underperform but without them going
[11:14] higher the best case the S&P can do is
[11:16] me is is again uh choppy sideways for
[11:19] the beginning of the year and then if we
[11:22] get through and we find enough uh uh
[11:25] let's say spending cuts and the econom
[11:27] is still okay then I think we can start
[11:28] looking looking through it after about 3
[11:31] to 6 months but I think we've we've kind
[11:33] of decided in the market that as long as
[11:34] the government's going to talk things
[11:36] down it's a problem I mentioned zalinski
[11:39] so he left the Oval Office and then over
[11:41] the weekend we got a massive move on the
[11:44] EU the EU will spend billions more on
[11:47] defense it's a powerful statement won't
[11:49] do much for Ukraine but it does a lot
[11:50] for for changing the markets so Germany
[11:54] immediately shocks markets by unleashing
[11:56] billions this is super important for the
[11:58] market
[11:59] here's what the defense index has done
[12:01] in Europe shocking just dramatic move
[12:05] and this is a back to 1990 this is all
[12:08] the data we have on German buns 10year
[12:11] buns we had a jump of one day of 29
[12:14] basis points the largest in history this
[12:17] is a VAR shock there is no way that um
[12:20] this didn't take out some people uh in
[12:23] terms of hedge funds this was another
[12:26] event on top of the so you got to think
[12:28] about um the autopsy as I'm calling it
[12:30] for the hedge fund unwind trade when
[12:32] momentum starts to turn when it's been
[12:34] working for a while then it starts
[12:36] getting people to adjust then you start
[12:38] getting all these little events there
[12:39] was an announcement over the weekend
[12:41] about large losses at one of the larger
[12:43] hedge funds um you start getting these
[12:45] little things which cause deleveraging
[12:47] and because we have so much money
[12:49] managed as I tweeted this week in an AI
[12:52] optimized manner you start getting these
[12:54] VAR shocks one by one especially when
[12:58] you get something like us growth which
[12:59] was supposed to be good and the
[13:01] government saying we don't want it to be
[13:03] good we're willing to sacrifice
[13:05] short-term growth for long-term gain
[13:08] well then the market has to adjust when
[13:09] you add in that now
[13:11] Europe the tightest Pur strings in the
[13:14] world have decided to spend a lot of
[13:15] money you get this dramatic shift so the
[13:18] losses that are out there I'm sure for V
[13:20] Sellers and everything happen this is
[13:23] going back and looking at when we
[13:25] started these conversations was right
[13:27] here this is the way it works for
[13:29] momentum you kind of get the the
[13:31] volatility has been rising and then all
[13:32] of a sudden you get this puke down we've
[13:34] now broken the trend line as of Friday
[13:36] for Pure momentum uh everything is
[13:38] shifted so people have to reposition and
[13:41] there's just not enough liquidity in the
[13:42] market relative to how big the leverage
[13:44] was and I'll go through that as we go on
[13:46] this is the sector momentums you finally
[13:48] got the consumer discretionary to join
[13:50] all the other ones so you've got the
[13:53] pure momentum the blue one here is the
[13:55] TMT you can see how much this went down
[13:57] they tried to get it back up around
[13:59] Nvidia and now it's collapsed back down
[14:01] the red one is Healthcare which had been
[14:04] in trouble all year but you've had
[14:05] momentum breaking down um a lot of talk
[14:08] going around and I thought this was
[14:10] interesting um because the market has
[14:12] only is only down 6% from its highs and
[14:15] yet there's a lot of people calling me
[14:17] going through it saying what's going on
[14:19] this has always been my specialty I love
[14:21] factors I love looking under but I
[14:23] managed a hedge fund for a long time uh
[14:26] and a bunch of managers and have seen
[14:28] hundreds and hundreds of portfolios over
[14:29] the years that are supposed to be Market
[14:31] neutral so when things happen with
[14:33] inside factors where growth momentum all
[14:36] these things are going on it ends up
[14:38] having a lot of problems that are taking
[14:41] things down so Leverage is coming down I
[14:44] completely agree uh over levered people
[14:46] are taking stuff down and that's leading
[14:48] to a lot of Trades this is really
[14:50] important and something I can't
[14:52] recommend enough to start thinking about
[14:54] we've been in a very concentrated Market
[14:56] since Co concentrated not just in in
[14:59] terms of the stocks that have worked but
[15:00] in terms of companies that are actually
[15:02] seeing earnings revisions you had you
[15:04] still have negative year-over-year
[15:05] earnings for the Russell 200000 in the
[15:07] fourth quarter of last year you've had
[15:09] negative earnings growth for Europe
[15:11] there hasn't been a lot of companies
[15:12] that have been able to have a part of
[15:14] the 3mon EPS revision Factor this is
[15:18] just the long side only uh this has been
[15:22] the market so this red line here is that
[15:25] factor 3-month revisions they have come
[15:27] down sharply in a multiple standard
[15:29] deviation move and the S&P has followed
[15:30] it this is what hedge funds are long
[15:33] absolutely no doubt about it and it has
[15:34] an impact on all hedge fund returns so
[15:37] this chart here red line again is that
[15:39] same 3month earnings uh per share
[15:41] revision so again this is going to be
[15:43] the companies that are having the
[15:45] highest three-month earnings revisions
[15:48] so they've now come down the sharpest so
[15:50] think of them as the best fundamental
[15:52] companies which generally means they're
[15:54] going to have high multiples think of
[15:55] this as palente tier think of this as as
[15:58] sales force think of this is any of the
[16:00] companies that you've seen fall sharply
[16:02] recently any of them most of them have
[16:04] good earnings revisions the green line
[16:06] here is the Bloomberg all hedge fund
[16:10] index you can see how correlated these
[16:12] are now this is updated every month this
[16:15] does not just include equities this
[16:17] includes multi strats so it doesn't it's
[16:19] long short equities it's multi strats
[16:21] it's um uh it's credit merger ARB risk
[16:26] ARB every single thing you can think of
[16:28] with this coming down I would expect to
[16:30] see this go cuz remember the equity
[16:31] books generally at the multi strats are
[16:34] the largest when they start deleveraging
[16:36] it spreads throughout the other Market
[16:39] neutral things and you start to see all
[16:41] hedge fund books come down you start to
[16:43] see macro get hit so I think we're in an
[16:45] unwinding phase and one of the reasons
[16:47] is this one is even more important so
[16:49] this is the long short Market neutral
[16:52] three-month reversion Factor the reason
[16:54] this one's important this move here
[16:56] which effectively
[16:59] is uh about a 7% move you got to think
[17:02] about it from since uh I guess over the
[17:05] last year we just gave back uh more than
[17:08] half of this in a very short amount of
[17:11] time this is the thing that had causes
[17:14] leverage so that thing had those that
[17:16] was a multiple standard deviation move
[17:18] and basically what ended up going on
[17:20] when you go through this I went through
[17:22] this and said what's the re recent draw
[17:24] down um and this is going back now even
[17:27] further so I took this back and I asked
[17:30] I put it into grock and I had grock go
[17:32] through it and this is the worst draw
[17:34] down now of
[17:36] 11.7% from the peak of this entire move
[17:40] since
[17:40] 2015 so this one here it's bigger than
[17:44] this one in terms of over the period 26
[17:47] days this was Co this is a very large
[17:50] move and it comes at a time where
[17:52] Leverage is at highs so leverage was not
[17:55] as high back then as it is now this is
[17:57] the Goldman Sachs head fun VIP basket
[18:00] which means the most owned hedge fund
[18:02] names and this is it relative to the S&P
[18:04] so I look at this relative to the S&P
[18:06] this was the worst
[18:08] week since 2008 and what I put in
[18:11] Twitter which is really important back
[18:14] here when this happened the vix was 80
[18:17] this happened before this week started
[18:19] the vix was sub was right around 20 four
[18:23] times the volatility back here than it
[18:25] was here which
[18:27] means this is is a scary one in terms of
[18:30] how much people were not prepared for it
[18:33] how much leverage they had on there was
[18:35] less leverage here more leverage here
[18:38] similar move so we'll see what happens
[18:41] but I think in the the month of March
[18:43] we've seen significant damage uh Zero
[18:45] Hedge put this out biggest thematic draw
[18:47] Downs in years uh Goldman Sachs high
[18:50] momentum long the hedge fund VIP which I
[18:53] just showed you middle inome consumer
[18:55] which is an important one the biggest uh
[18:57] the momentum pairs
[18:59] you're just having a lot of unwind
[19:01] happening uh we've seen an unprecedented
[19:03] drisking from hedge funds during the S&P
[19:05] pullback uh this was from Goldman Sachs
[19:08] uh again this was March 6th so this was
[19:11] in the middle of the week does not
[19:12] include uh the Thursday gross leverage
[19:16] this is from the peak so in the peak of
[19:19] when that uh earnings revisions Factor
[19:21] started to roll over it's exactly at the
[19:23] time period around February 18th uh for
[19:26] the market neutral one so from February
[19:28] 18th
[19:29] the 100th percentile of threeyear in
[19:32] terms of the leverage so that's what I'm
[19:34] saying and again current 5year 100 this
[19:37] the gross was enormous even the net was
[19:39] large but this is the one that I really
[19:41] care about in terms of the gross
[19:44] number uh Warren Buffett quote what does
[19:48] the saying when the tie goes out you
[19:49] begin to find out who's naked mean this
[19:51] is really important and this is why I'm
[19:53] saying I don't know how much further
[19:54] this is going to extend but when you
[19:56] have the government saying they're
[19:57] willing to shift the market into a
[20:00] recession Germany spends money so you
[20:03] get this massive correlation break where
[20:05] everyone needs to reassess that us
[20:07] exceptionalism which they were
[20:08] positioned for for well over a decade
[20:11] into 15 years is not working the mag 7
[20:13] are down 18% from the highs while the
[20:17] Dax is up close to 15% these are massive
[20:21] divergences and they're costing people
[20:23] or causing people to move but you also
[20:25] have hedge funds face new Watchdog
[20:27] scrutiny this was back on February 25th
[20:30] I didn't bring this up but whether it's
[20:32] the basis trade the carry trade they
[20:33] were still going through this their talk
[20:36] is that there's a problem hedge funds at
[20:39] the end of the month were trying to
[20:41] fight back that's all well and good but
[20:44] when you start having losses pile up it
[20:46] starts to become an issue this is in
[20:50] today's uh ft on Saturday hedge fund
[20:53] Leverage is rising as a concern for
[20:55] Regulators uh it goes through this and
[20:58] remember this is not including the
[20:59] losses that have gone on according to
[21:01] the US Office of Financial uh research
[21:03] hedge fund borrowing in so-called repo
[21:05] markets is increased by 1.5 trillion
[21:07] since the end of 2020 true almost a
[21:10] trillion of which is accounted for
[21:11] solely the largest 10 funds this is the
[21:14] issue is that these largest funds are
[21:18] the ones with the most complicated book
[21:20] depending on risk management depending
[21:21] on correlations of other assets and as
[21:23] of now this has primarily been a long
[21:25] short Equity thing with some macro uh
[21:27] stuff that I showed on the
[21:29] but this stuff starts and it usually
[21:30] continues to go hedge funds give up half
[21:33] of their 2025 gains in challenging
[21:34] markets say Goldman Sachs this was on
[21:36] Friday so again when losses start to
[21:39] pile up it starts to become an issue
[21:41] they also have another issue and I've
[21:43] talked about this AI is now ubiquitous
[21:47] it is now free it is now open source you
[21:50] can go in and back test anything I use
[21:52] grock all day long I use perplexity all
[21:54] day long to look at markets you can go
[21:56] in and have a back tested thing that has
[21:59] worked for the Last 5 Years whatever you
[22:01] want very easily you just have to upload
[22:02] the data the problem is that means
[22:04] everyone ends up in the same trades so
[22:07] you've got a situation that to survive
[22:10] as this Quant said funds must adopt AI
[22:12] to survive after deep seek I take it
[22:14] very differently I think there's just
[22:16] too much competition in ai's disrupting
[22:19] risk management more so than uh returns
[22:23] I think it helps the momentum side that
[22:26] it feeds to everyone to be in the same
[22:27] trades but when this stuff starts to not
[22:29] work the risk management stuff becomes
[22:32] the issue and I think it is false not
[22:34] working risk management that's going to
[22:36] be the issue and everyone knows what
[22:37] they should get out of based on using AI
[22:41] um AI startups are happening I've talked
[22:43] to three different ones over the last
[22:45] month asking my opinion uh because of my
[22:47] viser labs Consulting model they all are
[22:50] leaving existing uh Quant strategies and
[22:53] their ideas are very very good and
[22:54] they're all using gen AI so this is just
[22:57] going to be more competition so I think
[22:59] the hedge fund world is coming into a
[23:01] very big shift with Trump in office a
[23:03] shift towards Bitcoin Main Street versus
[23:05] Wall Street there's just a very big
[23:07] problem that's going on and The
[23:08] Regulators are looking into it and so if
[23:10] anything happens to force The Regulators
[23:13] to look closer because there's losses
[23:15] this is just the kind of stuff that you
[23:16] have to watch so I'll be talking about
[23:17] this a lot like I said I think the
[23:19] market and the hedge funds have probably
[23:21] had enough deleveraging for now I will
[23:23] start to go through what you have to
[23:24] look for to see if this is becoming a
[23:26] bigger issue uh in terms of just
[23:28] highlighting both the earnings and the
[23:30] economy and why this is such a big
[23:33] issue in the earn facts said earnings
[23:35] that lowest number of S&P 500's
[23:37] companies citing recession in over 5
[23:39] years on the calls so they're not
[23:41] talking about a recession there's no
[23:43] recession but at the same time every
[23:46] single earnings per share for this year
[23:48] is being lowered um across every single
[23:51] sector so we've already had a big drop
[23:53] off and the reason why on the same thing
[23:55] S&P 500 companies citing tariffs through
[23:58] the roof so half of the companies are
[24:01] talking about how tariffs are an impact
[24:03] Wall Street Banks say markets are
[24:05] flashing Rising recession risk no
[24:07] question recession risk is rising the
[24:09] government has said they don't care
[24:11] about growth right now Trump tariff
[24:13] uncertainty overshadows growth
[24:15] promises Wall Street worries Trump
[24:17] tariffs could wreck the saring economy
[24:20] uh is the White House trying to engineer
[24:21] a recession this is a commentary out
[24:23] there that very very large managers are
[24:27] calling me saying they believe uh BCA
[24:30] the first one to come out and say we're
[24:32] on a recession watch uh this is from
[24:35] Torsten slock uh biggest downside risk
[24:38] is policy uncertainty could create a
[24:40] sudden stop in the economy where
[24:41] consumers stop buying cars stop going to
[24:43] restaurants all the data we've seen so
[24:45] far in this quarter which has taken the
[24:47] GDP now down to minus
[24:50] 2.8% the data has all highlighted that
[24:53] the consumer is pausing on stuff that
[24:55] doesn't mean we're going to have a
[24:56] recession we don't have large job losses
[24:58] the job market was fine but this economy
[25:00] as I said is very dependent on the stock
[25:02] market so I think the White House is
[25:05] trying to do something that is going to
[25:06] be a very very tough needle to thread uh
[25:09] I just think it's going to be tough
[25:11] because of the stock market being 200%
[25:13] of GDP you tell me if you've heard that
[25:16] I follow it all the time and every time
[25:18] I talk to someone I did on on our pomp
[25:20] uh the pomp leano uh podcast for this
[25:23] week I brought it up repeatedly this is
[25:25] a very dangerous game when the stock
[25:26] market is this important um this is from
[25:29] torson slock again vacation intended in
[25:32] this in the US within 6 months complete
[25:34] breakdown uh look at it I mean the only
[25:36] thing you see on record anything
[25:37] comparable to this is right here uh you
[25:40] can't even see in a big way uh 911 so
[25:44] people are just confused over what the
[25:46] policy is Goldman Sachs updating their
[25:49] forecast higher inflation less gross so
[25:51] that's the stagflation side higher
[25:54] unemployment higher recession odds
[25:56] everything going against it and I would
[25:58] agree that all of those have to be your
[25:59] Baseline forecast of what's going to
[26:01] happen as long as the government is
[26:03] saying what they're saying and everyone
[26:04] is saying tariffs are coming um JP
[26:07] Morgan they're not wavering on on the US
[26:10] expansion uh same thing I believe
[26:12] however we are becoming more concerned
[26:14] that US policy actions will weigh on
[26:15] demand and damage sentiment in a manner
[26:17] that shakes the foundation of the
[26:18] expansion completely agree they say they
[26:21] want that uh the beige book came out
[26:22] this week here is what perplexity had on
[26:25] it um business sentiment ran cautiously
[26:27] optimistic but there was growing
[26:28] uncertainty surrounding new policies
[26:30] particularly regarding the tariffs um
[26:32] slight downtick in activity consumer
[26:36] spending weaken and there was increased
[26:38] CAU amount businesses due to policy un
[26:40] uncertainty the labor market shows signs
[26:42] of easing with
[26:44] improved slighter wage growth basically
[26:46] the economy is weakening it was already
[26:48] weakening ahead of time um JP Morgan on
[26:51] Doge unlike the Clinton cuts it was
[26:54] 450,000 jobs over eight
[26:56] years they're trying to get more done
[26:59] faster part of this is because of the
[27:01] midterms so they are willing to
[27:03] sacrifice Reagan style that's what I
[27:05] keep hearing uh they're willing to tank
[27:08] the economy in the case of Reagan it was
[27:10] through vulker raising rates
[27:12] dramatically to hurt it he gave Reagan
[27:14] said go ahead and do it we got to kill
[27:16] inflation this time it's very different
[27:18] the unemployment rate is 4% and CPI is
[27:20] three is is around 3% so now we're
[27:23] trying to cut a lot of jobs when the
[27:24] economy is weakening and the stock
[27:26] market is so important I just don't know
[27:28] how that's going to work uh I did want
[27:30] to bring this up the job Mar the job
[27:32] report on Friday was good it wasn't
[27:35] great and I still believe like I've said
[27:37] that the AI impact is starting to show
[27:39] up what I want to highlight here is I've
[27:41] broken the jobs Market into two separate
[27:43] categories so there 145 or 150 million
[27:46] jobs you can see that I break it down
[27:48] into two separate categories here this
[27:50] orange line here is what I call
[27:52] non-cyclical jobs non-cyclical jobs are
[27:54] the ones that have been going up
[27:55] regardless of what was going on in the
[27:56] economy other than the shutdown meaning
[27:59] it is continuously been going over the
[28:01] cyclical one is the one that has driven
[28:02] the economy over time when we have
[28:04] recessions the reason I say we can't
[28:05] have a recession is because of this line
[28:07] is becoming a much bigger portion this
[28:10] is Leisure and activity so this is for
[28:12] the Baby Boomers and travel this one
[28:13] there is some sensitivity to but we've
[28:16] had a labor shortage there so it
[28:17] continues to grow we're still building
[28:19] hotels we're still doing cruise ships so
[28:21] that continues to grow you have
[28:22] Healthcare and teachers we continually
[28:24] need to hire teachers cuz we have people
[28:26] that are retiring uh not getting fired
[28:28] so the replacement side on the teachers
[28:30] is there Healthcare we need more nurses
[28:32] people are sick it continues but the
[28:33] other one that's in here is the
[28:35] government so if the government isn't
[28:37] hiring the way they were you're going to
[28:39] start to see the Slowdown that is
[28:40] exactly what we've seen is it's starting
[28:42] to roll over a little bit this one is
[28:44] effectively unchanged since 2022 people
[28:46] hav really noticed this there's been
[28:48] very little job growth on everything
[28:50] else and so if we see the job stuff uh
[28:53] in the government come down I do think
[28:54] we're going to head towards zero with
[28:55] the combination of AI the government
[28:58] jobs and the fact that the tariffs are
[29:00] actually deflationary J Jared dillian
[29:03] put this out uh back on March 4th and he
[29:06] wrote about uh them being deflationary
[29:08] recommended a book to read and I
[29:09] completely agree Pompano and I talked
[29:11] about it as them being deflationary it
[29:14] is inflationary day one it's
[29:17] stagflationary overall but if you're
[29:19] intending to get the stock market lower
[29:22] and that's your goal that means he's
[29:24] going to do a he's going to put these
[29:25] tariffs through and he's sacrificing the
[29:27] stock Market that becomes deflationary
[29:30] uh more so than inflationary and that's
[29:31] what we're seeing in asset markets at
[29:33] least for the stuff for the United
[29:35] States is he willing to go far the
[29:37] reason I've said I didn't think he will
[29:39] go all the way and he still hasn't at
[29:40] this point is the approval ratings are
[29:42] starting to weaken so how much can he
[29:44] handle personally how much can he handle
[29:47] for the midterms he's coming under more
[29:49] pressure uh so we'll see what happens if
[29:51] he changes at any point I think the
[29:53] market will rally significantly uh I
[29:55] think this is all uncertainty at this
[29:57] point there's not nothing structural but
[29:59] if the S&P continues to break lower you
[30:01] will start to see more cries for
[30:03] recession and it'll become a
[30:04] self-fulfilling prophecy technically we
[30:06] hit a very big level this is why I think
[30:08] we're going to get a bounce I wouldn't
[30:09] even be surprised to see the bounce come
[30:11] all the way up to 6,000 uh which would
[30:13] be a significant Bounce from where we
[30:14] are that's a 3 to 4% bounce so I would
[30:16] not be surprised purely based on the
[30:19] fact that I think people want to come in
[30:20] and buy and that's because sentiment has
[30:22] gotten completely uh overdone so we've
[30:24] talked about the aii we've talked about
[30:26] other ones this one by far I don't pay
[30:28] for Ned Davis anymore this one was
[30:30] always the best one to me because it's
[30:32] so broad as a composite um this thing
[30:35] hit down to an extremely low level um
[30:39] and this is usually a very good sign in
[30:40] terms of going through it so Ned Davis
[30:42] got down to a very good Buy Signal the
[30:44] CNN fear feed and glear Fe fear and
[30:47] greed index hit the lowest since August
[30:50] so you've come down on on that one as
[30:51] well uh the Russell 2000 in terms of
[30:54] percentage of names greater than the
[30:56] 50-day moving average has completely
[30:58] come down this is the uh the 10 uh day
[31:02] moving average which is back at the lows
[31:04] here so the Russell uh iwm has been down
[31:07] six weeks in a row we're oversold and
[31:10] the other reason I would expect the
[31:11] bounce and this is going to be the most
[31:13] important thing going forward so this
[31:15] here reflects another big move down in
[31:17] terms of the factors this one here is
[31:20] going to be beta over profitability so
[31:22] beta collapsed relative to profitability
[31:25] every time we've kind of had one of
[31:26] these moves we made a low in the market
[31:27] over since really 2022 and the reason
[31:30] has been that credit spreads have
[31:31] continually tightened so this is junk
[31:33] spreads you can see and this is inverted
[31:36] they've starting to widen this is the
[31:38] critical thing if we're really getting
[31:40] worried about the recession then you're
[31:41] going to start to see junk spreads widen
[31:43] that has not happen yet here is lqd
[31:46] relative to if this is a good one to use
[31:48] for you guys uh using looking for
[31:50] real-time data um lqd is the investment
[31:53] grade ETF if is the government one this
[31:56] kind of gives you a spread uh during
[31:58] covid you can see how this one collapsed
[32:00] same thing during uh the great financial
[32:02] crisis when people are having trouble
[32:04] with credit especially multi strats who
[32:07] need to sell you will start to see this
[32:09] thing accelerate this is a very critical
[32:11] thing to watch it started to weaken last
[32:13] week I think this will be the one
[32:16] because this is where you get liquidity
[32:17] in the credit markets if you need to
[32:19] hedge up your book so lqd versus if um
[32:23] IG has not budged yet it's gradually
[32:27] moving out this is IG CDX um this here
[32:30] is the European Bank senior CDX still
[32:34] sitting at the lows if we get anything
[32:36] here that's important for multi strats
[32:37] you'll start to see it spread a little
[32:39] bit around the globe we're not there yet
[32:41] EU Banks I put this out on X this week
[32:44] the white line here is EU Banks amazing
[32:47] Trend uh as long as this is going on
[32:51] bitcoin is in good shape uh this is the
[32:53] overlay with Bitcoin over this so I do
[32:55] think that eventually when we get the
[32:57] bounce in the us you're going to see
[32:58] Bitcoin very quickly go up to the
[33:00] all-time highs uh so once we get a
[33:02] bounce in US Stocks I think it's going
[33:04] to uh have an impact on bitcoin and the
[33:06] reason is because I don't see a
[33:07] recession showing up anywhere this is
[33:09] another signal that's positive copper if
[33:11] we were really going into something
[33:13] worry of a recession the market then
[33:15] copper would be headed down copper looks
[33:17] great here it looks like a reverse Head
[33:18] and Shoulders ready to break out this is
[33:20] the PMI I think the US PMI is going to
[33:22] sit around here because of the tariffs
[33:24] but copper is saying that Europe and
[33:26] China in particular
[33:28] are strong China announced some more
[33:29] stimulus measures this week as well
[33:31] their stock market's doing well breath
[33:33] another reason right now that is not a
[33:35] problem I did want to highlight this
[33:36] chart so S&P breath this doesn't include
[33:39] Friday is basically at the all-time
[33:41] highs the price movements come down so
[33:43] there's been a rotation that's what this
[33:44] means we saw this in August during the
[33:47] August period too where the S&P came
[33:48] down sharply while the breath went
[33:50] sideways this move here in the S&P is
[33:53] what I think when we actually have a
[33:56] move lower in the S&P if we have another
[33:58] leg and it goes down to that area I
[34:00] talked about in kind of the 5200 to 5500
[34:03] area I believe it'll be a 3-day flush or
[34:06] a one day flush uh as part of a hedge
[34:08] fund unwind I don't think it's going to
[34:10] be because of a recession and remember
[34:11] the market I never thought was that
[34:13] expensive because of profit margins uh
[34:15] we're only down 2% year to date so it's
[34:17] not like it's some major problem but uh
[34:19] I do think we'd have to see a flush with
[34:21] the V expanding more than it has so far
[34:24] but I think it bounced first mag 7 we
[34:26] now got to an 19% draw
[34:29] down uh we hit the 200 day moving
[34:32] average and closed below it uh the last
[34:35] time we closed below it was here and you
[34:37] can see what happened we got a bounce
[34:39] these this looks very similar to this uh
[34:42] I've mentioned and I've shown this area
[34:43] because this is where if we look at the
[34:45] tips market in terms of the swap breaks
[34:48] BR Break Even curve inflation is still
[34:51] going higher so we're still seeing
[34:54] inflation expectations within 2 years as
[34:56] being high 10-year inflation
[34:57] expectations are coming down so we still
[35:00] have a problem right now where the curve
[35:02] is still showing that inflation
[35:03] expectations in the short term are still
[35:05] going higher and as that is the case uh
[35:08] I don't think we're going to see this
[35:09] kind of move but I do think the mag 7 is
[35:11] going to have trouble on a relative
[35:12] basis if that goes on uh mag 7 this is a
[35:16] monthly macd and this is why I think
[35:19] last time we got a monthly macd
[35:21] crossover we're close to it now it'll
[35:23] probably happen not this month but uh
[35:25] maybe next month remember we're in the
[35:27] middle of a month now uh last time that
[35:29] led to a decline I think this is going
[35:31] to be a period of time where this needs
[35:33] to work off the excesses uh that's in
[35:36] there uh Global money supply uh the
[35:39] white line here just made a new high so
[35:41] we had this move lower this has been
[35:43] driven by continuous growth in M2 for us
[35:47] now Europe and China but also because
[35:50] the dollar is weakening so you've gone
[35:51] back to the highs the gold this is the
[35:53] gold chart direct overlay pretty good
[35:56] with it normally Bitcoin goes with it
[35:58] Bitcoin has obviously been in here
[35:59] because Bitcoin is not just Global
[36:01] liquidity I always like to say Bitcoin
[36:03] is more like the S&P 500 it's about 30%
[36:07] Global liquidity 70% technology at this
[36:10] point uh this is going to go higher at
[36:13] this point and this will be the time
[36:14] where people start to realize that this
[36:16] is the purest AI trade as I've said
[36:18] repeatedly I will keep saying it here's
[36:19] the chart of Bitcoin relative to the mag
[36:23] 7 great looking chart I've highlighted
[36:25] that until you get to these points where
[36:27] it gets overdone these were both peaks
[36:30] in Bitcoin we got a long way to go here
[36:32] people uh I I expect a significant move
[36:36] higher in Bitcoin over the rest of the
[36:37] year because I don't see a recession in
[36:39] the US and I think we're going to start
[36:40] cutting rates the dollar is weakening
[36:41] already uh and I think what they're
[36:43] doing is going to lead to a stock market
[36:45] Fall uh not a crash a fall and if that
[36:50] happens I think they're going to have to
[36:51] lower rates and I think Bitcoin once it
[36:52] breaks back higher on a bounce I think
[36:54] it'll be sit in a good position uh
[36:56] another thing that has historically done
[36:58] very well as a trigger point for Bitcoin
[37:00] uh the Euro had its largest weekly
[37:04] Advance Over The Last 5 Years uh it
[37:07] happened here a similar Type move here
[37:09] was Bitcoin and then Bitcoin went higher
[37:12] then we had this one here uh Bitcoin
[37:15] bottomed and then it went higher uh
[37:17] there's a reason Europe is the Caboose
[37:20] of liquidity uh they have the tightest
[37:22] purse strings when they're willing to
[37:24] print as well the US it does not take
[37:25] much for us to print uh big week uh we
[37:29] finally signed the EO to establish a
[37:32] government Bitcoin Reserve uh like I
[37:34] said people I think wanted in the buy
[37:36] stuff but uh that's not the way this is
[37:39] going to work at least in not announcing
[37:40] it uh they had a digital asset Summit at
[37:43] the White House and I think most
[37:45] important is just the messages I promise
[37:47] to make America the Bitcoin superpower
[37:49] of the world and we're taking historic
[37:50] action to deliver on that promise why
[37:53] don't people pay attention to what's
[37:55] happening in the stock market he doesn't
[37:57] want the stock market to go higher but
[37:58] he does want crypto to go higher you
[38:00] should be long Bitcoin and you should be
[38:03] short mag 7even that's that's the trade
[38:06] going forward and he connects AI to
[38:09] bitcoin he has an AI and crypto Zar they
[38:13] are connected I will keep saying it and
[38:15] if you watch Anthony Pompano I'll keep
[38:17] driving home uh in there I have some
[38:19] other uh data on that as we go forward
[38:21] but uh lutnick put this up Technologies
[38:24] at the foundation the Trump pregnancy
[38:26] Trump presid presidency uh again crypto
[38:29] is an important part of what they're
[38:31] trying to do with the blockchain in
[38:32] there uh one of the winkl Voss twins was
[38:35] at the summit today's digital asset
[38:37] Summit made one thing crystal clear the
[38:39] Trump Administration is just getting
[38:40] started making America the most Pro
[38:43] crypto country in the world they're
[38:44] moving at the speed of a technology
[38:45] startup the Strategic Bitcoin reserve
[38:47] and stockpile are not the end but just
[38:50] the beginning uh I I don't know why
[38:53] people just can't embrace it at this
[38:55] point but they will uh no need to bring
[38:58] Bitcoin uh on
[39:00] Shore uh or they need to bring Bitcoin
[39:02] on Shore we'll see what going forward in
[39:03] any acquisition uh but both him and
[39:06] Sachs were out saying just highlighting
[39:10] that the government the previous
[39:11] administration was selling it and the
[39:13] first thing they're going to do is stop
[39:15] selling it uh this was one of the
[39:17] important stories that came out of the
[39:18] summit uh and I'll I'll tell you why
[39:21] stable coins will preserve dollar
[39:22] dominance I've talked about stable coins
[39:24] uh on this more importantly I just wrote
[39:27] something about it on Monday before the
[39:29] summit Andre's Bitcoin bet unleashing Ai
[39:32] and stable coins in a digital
[39:34] economy everyone who wants to either
[39:37] learn about the digital economy and what
[39:39] it's going to look like or is a Bitcoin
[39:42] uh and crypto lover you have to read
[39:45] Stripes 2024 annual letter that's what
[39:47] my that substack was about I go through
[39:50] the interconnection of ai ai agents and
[39:55] stable coins and the growth in the
[39:57] ecosystem Bitcoin benefits the second
[40:01] that people around the globe and
[40:02] startups decide to use stripe and decide
[40:05] to use stable coin for their
[40:07] transactions for lower cost faster
[40:10] transactions every time a dollar is
[40:12] there that means someone opens up a
[40:13] wallet they have more access into the
[40:15] crypto world the digital economy and
[40:17] Bitcoin is the Bank of that world that's
[40:19] where you put your money for store value
[40:21] every single time a transaction goes on
[40:24] in stable coins it leads to a better
[40:26] ecosystem they have been correlated in
[40:28] terms of the market cap of Bitcoin and
[40:30] the market cap of stable coins you have
[40:32] to spend the time I've talked to you
[40:33] about the treasury boring advisory
[40:35] committee in terms of going through it
[40:37] the government is saying they want
[40:38] stable coins to help preserve the dollar
[40:41] stripe is talking about the volumes that
[40:42] they're seeing and how quickly AI
[40:44] startups are growing this is a global
[40:46] phenomena that will continue to go and
[40:48] outside the US in countries like where I
[40:51] used to live Brazil you're starting to
[40:54] see more of this this is a global thing
[40:56] this is not us only situation and that's
[40:59] the thing you have to remember Bitcoin
[41:00] is not some speculative thing where I
[41:02] see Peter Schiff and these idiots
[41:05] talking about it in some way that it
[41:07] doesn't mean anything when it's
[41:08] happening around the globe so you can
[41:11] disagree and not believe that it's as
[41:12] good as gold but to say it has no value
[41:14] and it's a scam and there's no reason
[41:16] the government should be involved in it
[41:18] it's just I mean literally it's just
[41:20] being old and that guy on the chair on
[41:22] the in front of the house yelling at the
[41:24] kids um Bhutan how it's helped their fin
[41:28] Finance their nation's expenses again
[41:30] these are poor countries Brazil bhan El
[41:34] Salvador the IMF telling them okay we'll
[41:38] give you money buelli took the money
[41:39] then he bought more Bitcoin but only if
[41:41] you sto buying Bitcoin you just can't
[41:44] stop this this is a moat for the digital
[41:47] economy um bellaro is going through it
[41:50] that's it for me this week um like I
[41:52] said I'm I'm happy to be working with
[41:53] 22v you can go reach out to them
[41:55] directly you can reach out to me I'll be
[41:57] doing a lot of research for them during
[41:58] the week as well uh so if you're
[42:01] interested in trading with them doing
[42:02] stuff with them I'll be uh doing a lot
[42:04] of different research with them and then
[42:07] watch Anthony Pompano and I we'll be
[42:08] going through everything from both a
[42:09] macro and a and a crypto perspective uh
[42:12] thanks and I'll see you guys next week
