[00:00] back again. New all-time highs for the
[00:02] stocks.
[00:04] Momentum shock during the week,
[00:06] especially taking down gold, but other
[00:08] parts of the market. We've got Shei
[00:10] Trump this week. Goldman says it's the
[00:13] worst jobs market in 50 years, and I'll
[00:15] go through why it is and why it's uh
[00:19] going to be this way for a long time. Uh
[00:22] most important week for the year is
[00:23] coming up. You've got uh the bulls verse
[00:26] bears and AI verse tariffs. uh
[00:29] concentrated parabolic charts, AI fears
[00:31] continue. We're going to go through the
[00:33] Carpathy vers Altman case, Tesla
[00:36] reported ASML. I'm going to bring you
[00:38] guys uh some more details on something,
[00:40] a stock that I've talked about and just
[00:42] a company and how important they are. Uh
[00:44] this will be the lesson one on starting
[00:47] your AI journey. Um I've been doing this
[00:50] for about a year now. uh my ultimate
[00:53] goal uh was to turn my content into a
[00:56] business both for consulting, research,
[00:59] asset management and that's what I'm
[01:01] doing and that continues to move
[01:03] forward. Uh but one of the things that
[01:05] along the journey people have requested
[01:06] is I'm also going to be starting more to
[01:09] help people in terms of how to think
[01:12] about what I'm doing here and again the
[01:14] name of this uh and what I do is the AI
[01:17] macro nexus which means trying to
[01:19] prepare people both for what's happening
[01:21] in the traditional world which is moving
[01:23] in the slow lane that's the bottom end
[01:25] of the K-shaped economy versus the
[01:27] things moving in the parabolic chart
[01:29] side the AI and crypto side. Uh, and if
[01:33] you still need to go from the slow right
[01:36] lane of the traditional finance world
[01:38] into the left side, the fastmoving lane,
[01:41] I'm trying to help you be able to get in
[01:43] there before those two worlds merge. The
[01:45] people that are bearish, that are perma
[01:47] bears, that are telling you the world's
[01:49] going to end, they are saying that from
[01:51] a position, and trust me, I know they
[01:54] don't need to move over into the left
[01:56] lane. They've already made a lot of
[01:57] money. That's why they're focused on the
[01:59] bare side because it's too easy to make
[02:02] money in parabolic charts even if they
[02:04] correct 40% and then make new all-time
[02:06] highs which is the way Bitcoin moved for
[02:08] whatever and now you've got a lot of
[02:09] stocks doing it. So I'm going to start
[02:11] lesson one today out of request. The
[02:14] only thing I ask of you guys now the
[02:16] people that have been um I've had a lot
[02:18] of reach out from colleges. I'm going to
[02:19] keep doing that stuff in terms of doing
[02:21] demos. Uh subscribe. I actually have
[02:24] heard people say this over the year, but
[02:25] I'm telling you as I start going through
[02:27] it really helps me for you to subscribe
[02:29] so I can keep doing this. Uh, but also
[02:32] forward this to your family, friends,
[02:34] kids. The AI journey is for the people
[02:36] that are going to need to do it.
[02:37] Remember, the world's going to merge
[02:38] into one in about 5 years and it's going
[02:41] to be a very very dystopian five years
[02:43] in my view. uh as we get towards
[02:46] humanoids and we go through knowledge
[02:47] workers and the jobs market is
[02:49] disrupted, you need to learn how to
[02:50] embrace AI and use it and be an
[02:52] entrepreneur uh make your bed is kind of
[02:55] the theme that I'm going be running
[02:56] with. I'll get into that and then I'll
[02:58] talk Bitcoin stable coin and everything
[03:00] happening with Argentina this weekend.
[03:03] So, the S&P makes new all-time highs. uh
[03:06] I still remain in the same thing which
[03:09] is that can turn right back down again
[03:10] and fall further if she Trump falls
[03:12] apart and the tariffs actually hit in.
[03:15] So just remember um even though the
[03:17] probability is low, I still think this
[03:20] is an asymmetric event uh even though
[03:23] the highest probability is we just have
[03:24] a truce and we kick the can down the
[03:26] road. I do think any tariff thing that
[03:29] gets put on hold for a period of time is
[03:32] going to unleash a lot of buying and a
[03:33] lot of risk assets. And that's because
[03:36] unlike in April and May, we have the
[03:40] spending is already happening. The big
[03:42] beautiful bill is done. This is kind of
[03:44] like 2018 for me for the Trump uh first
[03:50] term which was 17 was the tax year
[03:53] everything ripped. Then 18 was the
[03:54] tariff year and the market fell and was
[03:56] weaker. Even though the market didn't
[03:58] fall this year, trust me, in my opinion,
[04:01] this has been a lot weaker than it would
[04:03] have been given what's going on with
[04:05] earnings and the spending that's about
[04:06] to come, but also the fact that we're
[04:08] cutting rates. S&P was up 2% last week.
[04:10] IWM was up two two and a half% so it
[04:12] outperformed again. QQQs were up 2% so
[04:15] it was across the board last week. Um, I
[04:17] did mention momentum was hit. Goldman
[04:19] pointed this out.
[04:21] uh really again its momentum. You still
[04:25] had the AI trades working particularly
[04:27] on the semi side but it did impact gold.
[04:31] You had a uh the biggest standard
[04:33] deviation uh move fall in gold. Take it
[04:35] back to liberation day. I do think
[04:37] there's a risk further down for gold uh
[04:40] to retrace the entire gains from the
[04:42] summer if there is a positive outcome in
[04:45] China and the US. I do think uh people
[04:48] have minimized and again remember every
[04:51] macro person that has been bearish
[04:53] bonds, bearish AI has made money in
[04:56] gold. They talk about it every day.
[04:58] There's not a single podcast that they
[04:59] don't say, "Well, I like gold and xyz."
[05:02] Or if you want to, you know, play that
[05:04] AI is going to disrupt the world. You'd
[05:05] be long gold. The fear in my opinion for
[05:08] everyone who's in this is retail's been
[05:10] involved as well. Retail has migrated
[05:13] there as it does because it's been
[05:14] working. And so you've had retail
[05:16] inflows that have been strong and I
[05:19] think we need to have some at least uh
[05:22] consolidation, but I would say if there
[05:24] was a China US deal that occurs this
[05:26] week that can be viewed as something
[05:28] structural, I think it's much bigger and
[05:31] better than people think. I'm not going
[05:32] to go through all the details on it, but
[05:34] a lot of this has to do with fears over
[05:35] Taiwan. A lot of this has to do with
[05:37] fears that there's no way to solve this,
[05:39] which has been one of the perma bear
[05:40] stories that I've heard repeatedly, even
[05:42] at dinners this week.
[05:44] um for the market as a whole. I just
[05:46] want to make this point because young
[05:48] people gambling, it's a warning sign.
[05:50] It's not a warning sign. It is part of
[05:52] this culture. If you guys haven't
[05:54] noticed, we've got gambling arrests in
[05:56] the NBA. Gambling is part of society. It
[05:59] is an entertainment. It is going to be
[06:01] this way. It is never going away.
[06:03] DraftKings was not allowed in sports
[06:05] here. This is the PCE dollars spent per
[06:08] year in gambling. It is going parabolic
[06:11] just like AI. It is going parabolic. It
[06:14] will not stop. Gaming is coming.
[06:16] Everything is coming. So remember,
[06:18] gambling is part of the market. And
[06:21] retail has assumed something that the
[06:24] government won't allow the stock market
[06:26] to fall. When you have something that
[06:27] goes up over 80% of the years, don't you
[06:31] think retail is going to make money if
[06:32] they just get involved in this? It is
[06:34] the institutional side that has hedge
[06:37] funds and then the long only funds have
[06:39] been replaced by cheaper fee funds like
[06:41] ETFs. So, everyone who's talking about
[06:44] this that thinks there's going to be
[06:45] some kind of correction, the markets
[06:46] have changed and gambling is part of it,
[06:48] but the government is debasing and
[06:49] they're trying to make things go higher.
[06:51] And now AI is making it go higher. Ups
[06:53] and downs in the Trump she stuff. I'm
[06:56] just going to go through the stories
[06:57] that started, but I will put this.
[06:58] Analysts expect any agreement reached at
[07:00] the summit would simply dial down
[07:01] tensions rather than been a sweeping
[07:03] accord. if anything happens that is
[07:05] viewed more favorably and since there's
[07:07] an 80% chance of a tariff agreement
[07:09] which is different than a trade
[07:11] agreement but let's just say the tariffs
[07:13] to me are the most important thing he
[07:15] has threatened tariffs he has used
[07:17] tariffs all year tariffs have gone
[07:19] higher than what people thought would
[07:21] happen and yet we've not seen the impact
[07:23] I think if any tariff situation comes
[07:26] down lower than where he had them before
[07:29] I I think that's going to be a uh a
[07:33] liftoff point for stocks. Um meeting
[07:35] could happen, may not happen. Uh then
[07:38] we've got uh US considering curbs on
[07:41] software. That's a big deal. So they're
[07:43] still doing tit for tat and still
[07:45] threatening negotiation going in it. She
[07:47] Trump can clear that up. Uh I do believe
[07:50] it is uh mutual mass destruction. Uh
[07:53] it's not rare earth wins. This is rock
[07:55] paper scissors. I'm going to bring up
[07:56] ASML. Lithography wins too. uh if China
[08:00] makes a decision to invade Taiwan, it
[08:02] would make sense based on everything
[08:03] I've shown over the last that it happens
[08:04] sooner rather than later, especially at
[08:06] a time when the US is out of ammunitions
[08:08] um and doesn't have any rare earth. So I
[08:11] think any trade agreement people are
[08:13] underestimating the impact that it would
[08:15] have and I think it would be a very very
[08:17] big deal for the market. Uh China even
[08:20] threatened the farmer leverage as a
[08:21] nuclear option. So they both have
[08:24] the ability to shut each other down and
[08:26] that's what makes it difficult. profit
[08:28] margins given concerns in the market
[08:30] about tariffs and higher costs. So again
[08:33] about tariffs and inflation. I've heard
[08:35] stagflation so many times and everyone
[08:39] that said stagflation said, "Yeah, the
[08:41] way it'll show up is in profit margins."
[08:43] You're all wrong. Profit margins are not
[08:45] only sitting above the 5-year average
[08:48] for six trades quarters. You can't even
[08:50] see any change in margins. So I'm sure
[08:54] there's an impact that's happening, but
[08:56] it's being masked by AI. the jobs
[08:58] market. This is Yan Hatsius. This is the
[09:01] worst. This is this week. This is the
[09:04] worst the jobs market has looked outside
[09:06] of a recession in 50 years. This part I
[09:10] think is just a bunch of crap. Um on the
[09:13] employment side, Hoti has noted the
[09:14] labor outlooks in surveys such as
[09:15] manufacturing had fallen well below the
[09:17] index point. Agreed. I've shown every
[09:19] one of these charts, including
[09:22] the tightness showing up on estimated
[09:24] unemployment rate, estimated job
[09:26] openings, the conference board labor
[09:27] market differential, and New York Fed
[09:29] finding job expectations to name a few.
[09:31] All of that have shown it. Now,
[09:34] he continues on,
[09:36] America may be in an era of jobless
[09:38] growth. So, jobless growth, the way I'm
[09:41] going to say this is jobless growth, but
[09:42] with GDP. The one thing he hasn't gone
[09:45] through is this. I've pointed this out.
[09:47] The job growth outside of the healthcare
[09:48] industry has turned negative in recent
[09:50] months. Outside of healthcare, we have
[09:53] been losing jobs. The reason I bring
[09:55] this up is every time that you hear the
[09:57] new excuse that no, this isn't true. The
[09:59] Fed shouldn't be cutting rates. They
[10:00] should absolutely be cutting rates
[10:02] because AI is destroying the jobs
[10:04] market. Not firing people, but making it
[10:07] impossible for people to get hired. And
[10:10] I'm going to show more proof of that.
[10:13] But every one of the times that people
[10:14] say, "No, no, no. It's just, you know,
[10:16] between the immigration and all of the
[10:19] stuff that hot it matters or surveys. If
[10:22] there was a situation that we aren't
[10:25] hiring as many people because the supply
[10:26] of labor has gone down, why are temp
[10:29] jobs collapsing? Why are the surveys in
[10:32] terms of hiring collapsing? Everyone
[10:35] ignores those things. Those things have
[10:37] been correlated to the unemployment
[10:39] rate. The reason the unemployment rate
[10:40] isn't closer to five is solely because
[10:43] the labor participation rate has gone
[10:46] down, which means that includes the
[10:48] people who need to work and that's been
[10:49] declining since way before immigration
[10:52] reversed. That was actually happening as
[10:54] immigration was fine. You have a
[10:57] situation where lending I didn't talk
[11:00] about that one. I got to make sure I
[11:01] bring this up. We have a K-shaped
[11:03] economy. As people lose their jobs and
[11:04] as rates are still sitting up at these
[11:06] levels, we are starting to see the tide
[11:08] of liquidity has gone out, it's getting
[11:11] harder and harder as you're getting
[11:12] these bankruptcies. So, yet another one
[11:14] with inside the car side prima lens this
[11:17] time. This is this week. You're getting
[11:19] more and more signs of this. The
[11:20] delinquencies are going up. This is the
[11:22] K-shaped economy. This is the we need a
[11:25] new type of politics in New York City,
[11:27] so we're going to vote for Mandani.
[11:29] You've got people that are having
[11:30] trouble. They're living paycheck to
[11:32] paycheck.
[11:33] 67% of US consumers are now living
[11:35] paycheck to paycheck according to a
[11:37] payment survey. Carvana stock falls
[11:39] sharply. The auto market is flashing
[11:40] water warning signs. Remember a lot of
[11:42] autos were at the 5-year mark from 2020
[11:45] when money was handed out. You're
[11:47] starting to see the term show up in the
[11:49] lender's default. Uh lenders are ramping
[11:51] up bankruptcy protection measures as
[11:53] they position for further distress in
[11:55] the wake of high profile. So on one side
[11:57] again you have the left lane which is AI
[12:00] and crypto violently moving forward at
[12:03] an pace that is exponential. On the
[12:05] right side you have this slowm moving
[12:07] what used to be a recession that would
[12:10] be causing trouble. The AI situation is
[12:12] hurting the jobs market. The jobs market
[12:15] and the deflationary side of AI is
[12:18] offsetting what is going on with
[12:19] tariffs. Equipment share is said to
[12:21] weigh US IPO. This is a company that was
[12:24] said to weigh an IPO as of August 20th.
[12:27] Equipment share bonds sync as ousted
[12:29] board member alleynches fraud. This is
[12:30] the same company. This is yesterday.
[12:35] Blackstone says error of bumper private
[12:37] credit returns. This is no joke. The
[12:40] error of lending is over. I'm not going
[12:42] to go through this today. I just want to
[12:44] say one thing to you. Exponential
[12:46] innovation. 5 years from now, the entire
[12:48] economy is merging with that fast lane
[12:52] obliterating everything in the slow
[12:53] lane. So if you're waiting for a
[12:55] recession, if you're waiting for
[12:56] something that the slow lane has,
[12:58] recessions and credit events are all
[13:01] based on time. We are in exponential
[13:03] innovation. Meaning today by definition
[13:06] is yesterday, every single day. You can
[13:09] ignore it. You can pretend it's not
[13:11] happening. But the reality is it is the
[13:14] credit situation. You will be having
[13:16] bankruptcies. It doesn't mean we're
[13:17] going to have a collapse. It just means
[13:19] whatever returns you thought you were
[13:20] getting in that when you got into it,
[13:22] you're not going to get them. You're
[13:23] going to have periodic defle uh bonds
[13:26] blowing up continuously from businesses
[13:28] that cannot compete in a world
[13:31] of AI, in a world of crypto. You will
[13:34] have more and more disruption the same
[13:35] way you did with Amazon
[13:38] versus all the retail stocks. And name
[13:41] everything that Amazon did in 2013.
[13:43] Amazon was not what it is today. And
[13:45] that's what we're going through. This is
[13:46] what's coming up this week. We've got
[13:47] the Fed. We've got the Trump sheet.
[13:49] We've got the Mag 7 earnings. The
[13:51] biggest week of the year is coming up.
[13:52] The biggest of the last. So, here's the
[13:54] irony of this situation. These are the
[13:57] two guys. Look at the way they're
[13:59] dressed. They look. They're drinking.
[14:02] They're both crypto and AI guys. These
[14:04] have been the ones that have killed it.
[14:06] These are not the people that you see on
[14:09] CNBC doing this from the Goldman Sachs,
[14:12] Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, Black
[14:14] Rockck. These are the people that have
[14:15] caught it. And when you listen to them,
[14:17] they are talking about the future.
[14:19] Believe it or not, this is one of my
[14:22] favorite things that these guys are a
[14:24] joke. And yet, they're both really,
[14:26] really smart to listen to about what's
[14:28] coming in the future because they're out
[14:30] there promoting themselves. They're both
[14:31] involved in AI. They're both involved in
[14:34] crypto. My boy Pomp, same thing. He had
[14:37] a great interview this week with, not
[14:39] surprisingly, Tom Lee. Says it's not a
[14:41] bubble and stocks are still cheap. Here
[14:43] are the details from what Tom Lee talked
[14:45] about. Argues AI is sector is not in a
[14:47] bubble. Goes through Nvidia's valuation.
[14:49] I just want you one time to do the
[14:52] numbers on Nvidia. Brad Gersonner did
[14:54] this on his BG2. He also did this on the
[14:57] all-in last week. It's a very simple
[14:58] thing. Go look at their revenues today
[15:01] and realize that every single data
[15:04] center, one gigawatt costs $50 billion.
[15:06] Of that, Nvidia is between 35 and 60% of
[15:11] that. So, of the 50 50 billion spent,
[15:14] every time Nvidia's chips are in there,
[15:16] it's 35 to 60%. Even if you haircut it,
[15:20] the stock is too cheap relative to the
[15:21] amount of gigawatts that are needed to
[15:23] power AI. So, you're betting on the fact
[15:24] that we won't build the power. you're
[15:26] betting on the fact that some magical um
[15:29] uh efficiency gain is going to come
[15:31] through when there's efficiency gains
[15:32] every day that Nvidia talks about. Their
[15:34] chips are all better than they were a
[15:35] year ago, better than they were two
[15:37] years ago. So, every time you hear some
[15:39] genius talk about the fact that this is
[15:41] going to happen, just remember they have
[15:44] a bias for whatever reason and go back
[15:46] to the incentive thing about why people
[15:48] do things. AI isn't just labor
[15:50] replacement. It's aentic, super
[15:51] intelligent. Capital expenditures are
[15:53] accelerating. the profit margins are
[15:55] going because they're spending money and
[15:57] they're getting the productivity growth.
[15:58] So on one side for the S&P you're
[16:00] getting the earnings growth on the
[16:01] expenditures, but you're also getting
[16:03] the productivity gains that are coming
[16:04] with the agentic side. This is the whole
[16:06] point of replacing the labor side. This
[16:08] is why it's going to happen. It just
[16:10] won't be fired right away over 5 years
[16:12] where we're supposed to hire say 10
[16:14] million people will hire nobody. So go
[16:17] to the bottom line. True bubbles,
[16:19] there's not a true bubble. If there was
[16:20] a true bubble, hedge funds will be
[16:21] bullish. we wouldn't have as he puts
[16:24] later uh and I'll get in there
[16:26] historical valuations don't apply in
[16:27] clean markets and that's because again
[16:29] of the profit margins and the roe I
[16:31] don't want to spend time on it but he
[16:33] calls this the most hated rally and this
[16:35] is something that is true the sentiment
[16:37] of professional investors so people that
[16:39] have been doing this for a long time
[16:41] remains net bears over the course of the
[16:43] year it's still net bears but here's the
[16:45] thing when you take the average for the
[16:46] year it's - 11.7
[16:49] similarly only to 199 1990 2008 and 2022
[16:53] bare markets we're up 15% year to date
[16:57] and we have monetary easing
[17:00] again we're going to start getting more
[17:03] and he says I expect a 30% correction
[17:05] next year I expect a 20 to 30%
[17:07] correction most years we've done it
[17:10] three of the last five so we've had bare
[17:12] markets guys it's just what ends up
[17:14] happening sorry three of the last six um
[17:18] if you go through and he talks about why
[17:20] it's not just an innovation wave. It's a
[17:22] structural rerating that gets back into
[17:23] the point of if you're reducing labor
[17:26] and your efficiencies are going up, it's
[17:28] a non-stop thing as long as AI continues
[17:30] to progress. So, we're doing agentic
[17:34] this year, we're going to get to
[17:36] humanoids in 5 years in terms of true
[17:39] like seeing the benefits that come into
[17:40] the bottom line. You're fading that. I
[17:43] don't even understand how you can do
[17:44] that without spending your time on AI
[17:47] and seeing if it's actually what it
[17:48] seems to be, which is what I spend my
[17:49] life doing. Almost every single slide
[17:51] you're seeing right now, it's me
[17:52] communicating with AI. So, if AI
[17:55] permanently lifts corporate ROE while
[17:57] making earnings less cyclical, which is
[17:58] what happens with this, we don't have a
[18:00] cyclical economy anymore. The fair
[18:02] multiple for the S&P 500 shifts
[18:04] structurally higher. Possibly from a 16
[18:06] long-term average to 22 to 25. The
[18:09] reason people don't like this is they
[18:10] still pretend like history is a guide
[18:12] when we didn't have AI during any of
[18:14] this and they say this is just like
[18:15] every bubble. That's what it is. So what
[18:17] I did was say, okay, let's take Dan Ies.
[18:19] Let's let's take Tom Lee. They're both
[18:21] two structural bulls. Give me what they
[18:24] view as differently than everyone else.
[18:26] Now these are two separate people. They
[18:28] talk differently. They look differently.
[18:30] One's a tech person. The other one's a
[18:32] strategist. Just go through the list and
[18:34] look at these things in terms of what's
[18:35] going on. They're telling you the same
[18:38] story. And eventually they get into
[18:39] digital assets. AI macro nexus. the
[18:43] point where AI meets traditional macro
[18:46] together. That won't happen for another
[18:49] 5 years. And when it does, by then,
[18:51] hopefully you've secured your job.
[18:53] Hopefully, you've trained your kids on
[18:54] how to use AI and not told them it's a
[18:56] bubble. Don't spend your time with it or
[18:57] try to send them to a school that
[18:58] doesn't allow it. They need to be
[19:00] entrepreneurs. They need to leave learn
[19:02] this now. I'll get to that later.
[19:05] This line here is when Chat GPT came in.
[19:08] This orange line here are the S SNP
[19:11] earnings
[19:13] going back to 1990.
[19:17] So temp hiring
[19:20] matches every single time when earnings
[19:24] go except for this time. So here we are.
[19:28] We're back to levels seen. I mean this
[19:31] is the total temp number. We're back to
[19:34] levels. So we didn't even take out the
[19:36] high. We took out the highs here and
[19:37] we've gone down. This has been recession
[19:38] times. And what are the S&P earnings
[19:40] going up? So, let's see. Stop hiring
[19:43] temps.
[19:45] Watch the S&P earnings continue to grow
[19:48] from Chat GPT at that point. Here's
[19:51] another one. Hiring. This is an overlay
[19:54] of Jolts to the S&P earnings. So, again,
[19:57] the S&P earnings going higher, making
[20:00] new all-time highs. They're not hiring.
[20:02] So, the J the Jolts number hiring.
[20:04] Again, go back over time and look, the
[20:06] hiring starts to come in when the
[20:09] earnings stop growing. Well, we still
[20:11] have earnings growing, the hiring is
[20:13] going down. Part of this is that the S&P
[20:16] 497 are in a recession and that the MAG7
[20:20] keep getting bigger and bigger. This is
[20:21] the concentration side, but part of this
[20:23] again is the adoption of AI. Everyone
[20:25] will be doing what the MAG7 has because
[20:27] remember their profit margins are the
[20:29] highest in the market. That's why the
[20:30] S&P profit margins are so high. Now,
[20:33] everyone's going to get the chance to
[20:34] use artificial intelligence. This I want
[20:37] to remind people cuz remember as you're
[20:39] listening to these people, go back and
[20:40] see what they were saying back when the
[20:42] tariffs, this was back from April 21st.
[20:44] Look at this. The tariffs are going to
[20:46] be the highest in 8090 years, 14 a half.
[20:50] This is going to lead to a recession if
[20:52] they're there. This is going to lead to
[20:53] inflation.
[20:55] Here's where we are now. Here we are.
[20:57] Fast forward September. We actually
[20:59] ended up there. We're at 15 and change
[21:01] now. Here's the actual number. I'm
[21:02] sorry. 17 16 and a half.
[21:06] This is where we are now.
[21:10] This is what they were saying. This is
[21:11] UBS is still saying US recession
[21:13] probability now at a staggering 93%.
[21:15] This is this week. Um JP Morgan
[21:19] recession odds 60% chance. This again is
[21:22] right after liberation day. Larry
[21:24] Summers predicts US recession 2 million
[21:26] job losses. Hm. What's US stagflation
[21:30] risk mean for the world? I mean, again,
[21:33] guys, I I don't like
[21:35] I don't know. This is what Tom Lee said
[21:37] on May 15th. E economists predicting a
[21:39] recession without with certainty are
[21:41] dead wrong. Literally said dead wrong.
[21:44] In my 30 years, I've never seen and what
[21:46] he continued to say, an economist
[21:48] predict a recession. I've also never
[21:50] seen a person predict when the whole
[21:52] market is trying to predict a bubble and
[21:53] saying there's an AA bubble. When I came
[21:55] back from Brazil, people were telling me
[21:56] there wasn't a bubble. So, I don't know
[21:59] this situation, but I do know this. If
[22:01] we're in stagflation, profit margin
[22:03] shouldn't be doing this. This is AI,
[22:05] guys. So, yes, there is a part of the
[22:08] economy that if AI didn't exist would be
[22:10] in recession. There would be a part of
[22:11] this if the cloud didn't exist. All of
[22:13] this stuff has happened since 2007. Oh,
[22:16] and by the way, we probably would have
[22:17] had a recession if Silicon Valley Bank
[22:19] was allowed to go under and the Fed
[22:21] didn't bail them out. So we have two
[22:22] changes since 2008. Unlimited liquidity
[22:26] facilities to put in place, which is
[22:27] anytime you worry about credit, it
[22:29] doesn't mean anything. Credit is now
[22:31] allowed to go the way China does it,
[22:34] which is okay, we'll gradually let it go
[22:36] out of business. They just don't allow
[22:38] the contagion. They stop the contagion,
[22:40] but they allow businesses to go out of
[22:41] business. We're going to see tons of
[22:42] bankruptcies now because they raised
[22:44] rates. They said they wanted a
[22:46] recession. They weren't able to get it.
[22:47] And that's because the part of the
[22:49] economy that is the biggest, the
[22:51] technology and digital economy side is
[22:53] growing so fast that it's offsetting
[22:55] everything happening in the other one.
[22:56] So both people are right. There's a bare
[22:58] market somewhere. There's a bull market
[22:59] somewhere. That's pretty much always the
[23:01] situation. This is from Goldman Sachs
[23:04] about retail. Someone asked the question
[23:06] why retail keeps outperforming
[23:08] institutional money. Simply put, retail
[23:10] has remained risk-seeking while
[23:11] institutions have been cautious. Nets
[23:13] and sentiment have remained low all
[23:14] year. institutional money tethered to
[23:17] valuation and those pesy pesky
[23:19] fundamentals. When they say those pesky
[23:21] fundamentals, when they say valuation,
[23:24] this is history. The same way that when
[23:27] people say when uh defense when interest
[23:30] expense passes defense expense, never
[23:34] bringing up the fact that we never had
[23:37] entitlements in any of these parts in
[23:39] the past. So interest expense seems
[23:41] really big but not when it is such a
[23:43] small number out of the entitlement
[23:46] number. This is a completely new world
[23:49] and these historical benchmarks to do is
[23:52] why these guys actually get it but
[23:55] nobody listens to them and they try to
[23:57] make it hard to listen to them and I
[24:00] love it.
[24:02] All right, this is what I wrote this
[24:03] week because I started to get the next
[24:05] phase. I come in every Monday and
[24:07] there's something that comes out over
[24:08] the weekend with something about how AI
[24:11] is is a bubble. Capitalism tells fables
[24:14] about the future so it can afford to
[24:15] build it. This isn't criticism, it's
[24:16] description. Every major technological
[24:18] leap arrives wrapped in exaggeration.
[24:20] The steam engine was sold. Blah blah
[24:21] blah. The whole point of this that I
[24:23] wanted to write about was related to
[24:25] Andre Carpathy's interview that was done
[24:27] that got everyone freaked out. There
[24:29] were some things in X saying, "Oh, this
[24:30] is the end. Watch how much Nvidia is
[24:32] down on Monday."
[24:33] Carpathy is an incredibly smart guy. I
[24:36] like listening to him all the time. He
[24:38] was at OpenAI and most importantly to
[24:40] me, he was with Tesla
[24:42] and is the head or was the head of their
[24:45] whole autopilot unit in terms of the
[24:47] engineer on it. So I care a lot about
[24:49] what he said and what he said I actually
[24:51] agree with, but everyone else read it
[24:53] and decided. So I wanted to write
[24:54] something where capitalism always tells
[24:56] fables. AGI is what he was referring to.
[24:59] So when you hear fables, capitalism
[25:01] tells fables. Remember the thing I
[25:02] showed you about equipment shares?
[25:03] Equipment shares was telling a fable.
[25:05] They were trying to raise an IPO and
[25:07] then there was fraud. So everyone
[25:08] immediately jumps to fraud. Sam Alman
[25:10] could blow up. Open AAI could blow up as
[25:13] part of this. But the problem is you are
[25:15] in a part of the phase where you're not
[25:16] seeing any sign of it because demand is
[25:17] greater than supply. And when you're in
[25:19] a bubble, supply is greater than demand.
[25:21] This is the DRAM price. So remember gold
[25:24] and how much gold has gone up since
[25:26] August. Everyone's investing in that,
[25:27] but they want to fade this. This does
[25:29] not trade on a public market where
[25:31] retail can trade it. This is not driven
[25:33] by stock prices. This is a commodity.
[25:35] This is DRAM. This has gone from here in
[25:38] September to here. Here is the last two
[25:42] years. Think about what's happening. And
[25:45] then go look at the Micron chart. Go
[25:47] look at all of these AI things. We have
[25:49] a shortage right now of compute and
[25:52] memory as I've talked about and what's
[25:54] going higher with it. These are the
[25:56] parabolic stocks that I was mentioning.
[25:58] the parabolic companies. So, you've got
[25:59] Micron in here, you've got Comfort
[26:01] Systems Fix, you've got that DRAM price,
[26:04] you've got Oracle, you've got EOS.
[26:06] Everyone still finds a reason that these
[26:07] are bubbles, that they're not real, that
[26:09] there's something going on. The reality
[26:11] is this is what Comfort System said.
[26:14] That isn't retail. This is about what
[26:17] they have. Their order fix reported its
[26:21] largest ever backlog up $10 billion.
[26:26] Look at that number and then go look at
[26:28] the size of comfort systems company it's
[26:31] up 9 billion 65% year-over-year
[26:35] explained that modular construction this
[26:37] is construction stuff they are seeing
[26:40] explosive growth he described this
[26:41] AIdriven data center trend as a seismic
[26:44] shift for the industrial sector noting
[26:45] that the company has transformed from a
[26:47] midsize contractor that's why I say it
[26:49] was a small company into a core player
[26:51] powering the AI revolution $9 billion
[26:54] backlog for a company that was less than
[26:56] $10 billion not that long ago as a
[26:58] market cap. That's why those stocks are
[27:00] going up. So everyone that's fading it
[27:02] saying, "Hey, it's a bubble. Once it
[27:04] pops, we're all going to suffer." These
[27:06] are all this week. Data center lending
[27:07] probe by BFA amid AI bubble fears. Surge
[27:10] in AI demand and price increase likely
[27:12] to drive earnings upgrades. So this is
[27:14] the positive side of it. No signs of AI
[27:16] bubble burst
[27:18] this weekend. I also got this. Alibaba
[27:20] cloud cuts Nvidia usage by 82%. Look at
[27:24] the efficiency gains. Alibaba is going
[27:26] through Goldman Sachs sharply raises
[27:28] Alibaba's capital capex outlook to 65
[27:32] billion. Explosive growth in inference
[27:34] demand. AI efficiency improvements draw
[27:36] drive stronger revenue. The efficiency
[27:39] improvements are driving stronger
[27:41] revenues. Efficiency driving. Oh, that's
[27:44] right. We're getting back into Jevan's
[27:46] paradox. You're moving efficiencies.
[27:49] Price comes down. More people are using
[27:51] it. So you can go through this but the
[27:52] token usage the adoption side inference
[27:55] demand and token consumption are growing
[27:57] exponentially. Bite dance recently
[27:59] announced that its average daily token
[28:00] consumption surpassed 30 trillion in
[28:03] September alone doubling from April to
[28:05] May a level approaching Google's 43
[28:07] trillion. Alibaba also revealed that its
[28:11] inference ran doubles every 23 months.
[28:13] The reason I want to bring this up
[28:14] remember the Mag 7 are competing with
[28:16] China. China is absolutely dealing with
[28:19] this. Here's what Airbnb said. We're
[28:21] relying a lot on Alibaba's Quen model.
[28:24] They are winning open source. It's very
[28:26] good. It's fast and it's cheap. We use
[28:28] OpenAI's latest models, but we typically
[28:30] don't use them that much in production
[28:31] because they are fast. There are faster
[28:33] and cheaper models. This is why at the
[28:36] end, if you guys are looking for how
[28:38] this works, the multiples of the Mag 7
[28:42] are going to come down unless they
[28:44] generate tremendous revenues. They're
[28:46] going to make enough revenues, but if
[28:47] they're competing with China, they're
[28:49] not going to get 100% of the pie. This
[28:51] is going to be distributed in a much
[28:53] bigger way, which means price to sales
[28:56] is the new debt to equity. I'll keep
[28:58] saying it again and again. So, this is
[28:59] the podcast with Andre Carpathy that got
[29:02] everyone bearish. Um,
[29:05] he he's saying AI is he saying he's in a
[29:07] it's in a bubble. No, but he's is
[29:09] basically saying that saying it's the
[29:11] year of agents, calling it over
[29:13] prediction. Okay. He's not saying there
[29:15] won't be AI agents. He's saying in his
[29:18] level, we're not there. Meaning we're
[29:21] not at AGI. They can't do everything it
[29:23] is. And then he goes through this to
[29:24] describe. He says he's extremely bullish
[29:26] on a AI as a tool, but clear that it's
[29:28] not yet a substitute for human
[29:30] cognition. Okay? Anyone that doesn't
[29:32] know that I I I of course it's not there
[29:36] yet. So that's why again as I go through
[29:38] it's the realism versus the hype machine
[29:40] and he's calling it out. Dwaresh and
[29:43] Cararpathy are both brilliant, but
[29:45] neither of them are involved in frontier
[29:46] model work. So 10 years to AGI is
[29:48] basically vibe forecasting. Could not
[29:50] agree more. Nobody knows when this is
[29:52] happening. Nobody. It doesn't matter.
[29:57] Did he say that true AGI is not reached
[29:59] until AI can work in the physical world
[30:00] like a human? Yes, I agree with that
[30:03] 100%. So I completely agree with what he
[30:06] is saying, which is that we're not going
[30:07] to have AGI. That's my personal
[30:09] definition that if you ask me what it
[30:10] is, artificial general intelligence
[30:12] means it can do everything that a human
[30:14] can do from a thought process, which
[30:16] also means the ability to walk through a
[30:18] room and see everything and make
[30:19] decisions real time on this. That means
[30:20] autonomous vehicles, that means
[30:22] humanoids. That's what he's saying is
[30:24] that it has to be visual. It can't just
[30:25] be textual. And I completely agree with
[30:27] that and we're not at that point yet. At
[30:30] the same time, the podcast that I
[30:31] recommend the most, if you haven't, if
[30:33] you didn't hear it already, please
[30:34] listen to it. The singularity is already
[30:35] here. AI is solving math. Sora outpaces
[30:39] chatbt and AI is designing chips. This
[30:42] is where you're starting to get into the
[30:44] next phase of AI. And that's what I
[30:46] wanted to cover. There are two arguments
[30:47] in this. The Carpathy argument which
[30:49] includes Karpathy, Deis Sabis, Yan Lun
[30:52] from Meta, Jeffrey Hinton really one of
[30:55] the fathers of AI, Alon Mus and Dario
[30:57] Modi from Anthropic. They're in one camp
[31:00] in terms of what AGI and what it means.
[31:03] It requires new architecture, long-term
[31:05] memory, multimodality, which means the
[31:07] vision as well. And continual learning
[31:08] must exist before true general
[31:10] intelligence, uh, 10 years. Then you've
[31:12] got the recursive learning side, just a
[31:14] different definition. AGI will emerge
[31:16] once systems recursively improve
[31:18] themselves. Meaning, they're learning on
[31:20] their own. You can have this point going
[31:22] on already and this point not there yet.
[31:25] That's why they're both right. In my
[31:26] opinion, there's recursive learning that
[31:28] clearly is happening based on everything
[31:30] that people are seeing. It's just the
[31:32] degree of what level. So it's kind of
[31:34] like going from 25 to 75. You don't just
[31:37] go from 25 to 75. You go from 25 to 30
[31:40] to 35 to 40. That's what we're going
[31:41] through. And that's why these arguments
[31:43] in these bare markets and taking
[31:45] something that is continually moving and
[31:47] turning it into a binary is just not
[31:49] right. So Musk versus Carpathy on AGI,
[31:52] a system that can see, hear, move, and
[31:54] reason and embodied intelligence
[31:56] indistinguishable from a human's
[31:57] capability. I agree. That's his
[31:59] definition. A system that can remember,
[32:01] perceive, reason, and act across
[32:02] modalities. A digital employer agent
[32:04] with persistent cognition. These are
[32:07] very similar. They're basically on the
[32:08] same page in this. They might have
[32:10] different timings as to where it is.
[32:12] Now, Elon Musk posted an X saying 99% of
[32:15] input and output for all a models will
[32:17] be photons. Okay? And this is a critical
[32:20] part when it comes to Tesla and it comes
[32:22] to
[32:24] humanoids. So, they're both again why
[32:28] you need to have pixels. It's the only
[32:30] way to scale. In short, Musk is
[32:32] forecasting a photoncentric future for
[32:34] AI to unlock godlike scalability
[32:38] where light becomes a default language.
[32:40] This gets really important because this
[32:41] is why to go from text to this, this is
[32:44] going to take a while. The next two
[32:46] stages of AI, we finished stage one.
[32:48] We've consumed all human knowledge and
[32:50] now we're starting to get garbage on the
[32:51] the textual side. So they have to get
[32:53] good at ignoring it. This is why Tesla's
[32:56] robo taxis are so important. This is why
[32:58] I wrote this. This is why everyone again
[33:00] that has a perma negative view on Tesla.
[33:02] These guys in my opinion, due to Alan
[33:06] Mus, due to Carpathy, these two guys
[33:08] have worked on this and that's where we
[33:10] are now in terms of making that next
[33:12] step. We need to have this to get to
[33:15] true AGI and they've been working on it.
[33:17] Not Whimo, Tesla. You can be positive on
[33:21] Whimo as a car, but Tesla is making the
[33:24] move to get into both. So, in the Q3
[33:28] earnings from last week, Elon Musk
[33:29] expressed 100% confidence in achieving
[33:32] unsupervised full self-driving at a
[33:34] safety level far out exceeding human
[33:36] drivers with plans to remove safety
[33:37] drivers from robo taxis in large parts
[33:39] of Austin by year end. as soon as they
[33:43] make it through this where there's
[33:44] safety drivers are gone. Okay, where
[33:47] he's saying and again he he might be off
[33:49] by 3 months we're definitely heading
[33:51] there but the second that you are at
[33:53] year end where the safety drivers are
[33:55] gone in my opinion the investors will
[33:57] start jumping on this fact. So the fact
[33:59] that the price has moved, remember price
[34:02] leads narrative. The narrative for
[34:04] investors is going to be starting to
[34:06] look at the full TAM for not only you
[34:09] for not only robo taxis for that you can
[34:12] just go read Dan Ies and go see what he
[34:14] says but it starts to merge in Optimus
[34:16] because the brain for if the brain is
[34:18] good enough to drive around with it's
[34:20] not too far for this but also he
[34:23] confirmed that a prototype of the nextG
[34:25] Optimus version 3 will be unveiled in
[34:27] February or March 26th. Now, what
[34:29] unveiled mean? I don't know. He also has
[34:33] the shareholder investor event coming up
[34:36] on November 6th. So, the fact that he
[34:39] said there's going to be a that he's
[34:41] going to be removing the drivers. Let's
[34:42] go. If Tesla remove safety drivers from
[34:44] robo taxis by year end and demonstrate
[34:47] safe sustain autonomous operations, the
[34:49] valuation pol policies contemplate both
[34:51] bear and bull. So, bulla ba base case
[34:54] here and again this is revenue not
[34:56] valuation. the bull case becomes very
[34:58] very large. Goldman Sachs and ARC
[35:01] forecast 150 to 200 billion in annual
[35:03] revenues from mo from autonomous
[35:05] mobility by 2030
[35:08] with margins nearing 40 to 50% due to
[35:10] lower operational costs and high
[35:12] software.
[35:14] So the price targets in the bull
[35:15] scenario reach 3,000 to 4,000. Again,
[35:18] I'm not getting into where the stock's
[35:19] going to be. You guys can do your own
[35:21] homework on what you think is going to
[35:22] happen. I'm just saying that that's how
[35:24] important this is. And a lot of people
[35:26] especially that cover the stock or that
[35:28] have a view just like they do with AI,
[35:30] they're not even spending time on it
[35:31] because they don't believe it's going to
[35:33] work. What would happen in terms of the
[35:35] typical cost versus Uber and versus
[35:38] Whimo? Will you get significantly lower
[35:41] fairs because of the cost of the car?
[35:43] The reason that's important, will it be
[35:45] difficult for other cities, think New
[35:47] York, to not allow Tesla robo taxis
[35:50] without the safety driver if it can save
[35:52] riders 50% compared to other rides? You
[35:55] already have problems in cities with the
[35:57] inflation side. This is going to be
[35:59] something because of where we are today
[36:02] where inflation is a massive political
[36:04] risk. If it's working in other cities
[36:06] and it costs $10 to take uh a robo taxi
[36:10] and $30 to take an Uber and in New York
[36:13] they're not allowing it, it's going to
[36:15] be pressured. This is the way AI and
[36:17] this stuff is going to spread in states
[36:19] that are trying to regulate things
[36:20] because eventually if people are having
[36:22] trouble with jobs, the pressure on
[36:24] payments living paycheck to paycheck,
[36:26] every dollar counts and that's what
[36:28] you're going to see. Now the other thing
[36:29] with it is as they start driving they
[36:32] accumulate more real world miles. The
[36:34] resulting data enhances the training of
[36:36] their large-scale AI models. Remember,
[36:38] as they get more and more autonomous
[36:40] vehicles, which will happen if the auto
[36:43] autonomous driving is allowed, if robo
[36:46] taxis are allowed without the safety
[36:47] driver, then people can start to get in
[36:50] the business of having their car be an
[36:52] Uber without needing to be in it, which
[36:54] means they can be making money. That
[36:56] collects more data on its own. you go
[36:59] through it, they're driving more often,
[37:00] you start to get more driving miles, and
[37:03] just like you do with an LLM, you
[37:05] actually get a better model. So, a
[37:07] successful unsupervised robo taxi driver
[37:11] uh
[37:13] prepares the readiness of the brain for
[37:15] Optimus. Tesla's FSD and robo taxi
[37:18] software represent one of the most
[37:19] advanced vision-based AI stacks in real
[37:21] world navigation, perception, autonomous
[37:23] decision-making. So all of these things
[37:25] go through the economic implications for
[37:28] it. It's super important as the
[37:31] beginning to the timing of this. Yes,
[37:34] Tesla robo taxis play a critical role in
[37:37] the timing and path towards reaching AGI
[37:39] until you get to the point where they
[37:40] can learn more. It's going to take
[37:42] longer to get to fullblown humanoids.
[37:44] Humanoids are already happening. If you
[37:46] haven't seen this video, again, figure
[37:49] 03. The difference for this is this is a
[37:50] video, but it shows it in the home. So,
[37:52] if you want to go see what's actually
[37:54] going on, remember, is Figure 03 the
[37:56] Model T moment for robots.
[37:58] Is the humanoid robot industry ready for
[38:00] its chat GPD moment? I will say that
[38:02] Tesla's
[38:04] robo taxi when we get the first ability
[38:07] for it to have be unsupervised
[38:10] and it spreads even if there's accidents
[38:13] and even if they try to shut it down the
[38:15] data is going to start to be captured
[38:17] and the the the humanoid chachi moment
[38:20] will be looked back in my opinion as
[38:21] when robo taxis went. So now jumping
[38:25] back to what was said in the singularity
[38:27] piece for moonshots. We're already
[38:28] living in the singularity. AI adoption
[38:30] is eight times faster than the internet.
[38:31] GPT pro solves math again. All of these
[38:35] things AI and data centers drive 92% of
[38:38] US GDP. You guys can go go through it. I
[38:41] am also in the camp that people just
[38:43] don't realize we'd be having a recession
[38:44] right now if it wasn't for AI because
[38:46] the profit margins would also not be
[38:48] good. And if the profit margins wouldn't
[38:49] be good, the stocks would be down. the
[38:50] stocks were down, there'd be no
[38:52] consumption because we already know that
[38:53] the job market's weak. The only way
[38:55] people are spending is that of savings.
[38:56] And the savings that they're able to
[38:57] spend that is at the high net worth
[38:59] individuals, which is dependent on asset
[39:01] prices. So asset prices go up. The new
[39:03] economy will be defined by abundance.
[39:05] I'm not going to talk about this in
[39:06] great detail today, but I did start to
[39:09] talk about it for a while in here. If
[39:11] you want to start to hear the way that I
[39:14] think about the way the world will look
[39:15] in 15 years, which I have not talked
[39:17] about on this video, uh, let's just say
[39:20] it all has to do with abundance has to
[39:23] do with not needing people to do
[39:24] anything. So, you get into a scary thing
[39:27] of identity, but that's where we're
[39:28] headed, which is the jobs market is
[39:30] changing. Now, for Dark Cash, he did put
[39:32] out something very good this week on the
[39:34] capex overhang thoughts on the AI
[39:36] buildout. And again, I'm not going to go
[39:38] through all of this. I think it's
[39:40] worthwhile to go and he did it on Sam
[39:42] Walton says he wants to create a factory
[39:43] that can produce a gigawatt of new AI
[39:44] infrastructure every week. So what would
[39:48] that mean? They question whether it's
[39:50] physically possible and that's the
[39:51] point. Can can the power grids materials
[39:53] and supply chains scale fast enough? And
[39:55] that's the question we're going to run
[39:56] into. Everyone's worried about the
[39:57] money. They're worried about the bubble.
[39:58] The question is the demand is so great
[40:01] right now that if they could and they
[40:02] could snap their finger, they need all
[40:04] this. That's not what was happening in
[40:06] the bubble, the dot bubble. We didn't
[40:08] need the supply because we didn't have
[40:10] the applications. They already have the
[40:12] demand for it. That's the problem. The
[40:14] difference between the two. We're
[40:15] playing from a position where the supply
[40:18] can't actually be built because this
[40:19] came out of nowhere and the demand is
[40:21] going too fast. So the compounding is
[40:23] happening every 6 months. That fast lane
[40:26] is moving at an exponential pace. So you
[40:28] have exponential demand. We want to cure
[40:30] cancer. can't do that if we're giving
[40:32] everyone porn and we're giving everyone
[40:34] all these tools for videos and
[40:36] everything which these guys need to do
[40:37] to generate revenues. So the problem
[40:39] they're running into is they can create
[40:40] all these tools. They can't let you make
[40:43] a video for an hour and a half so you
[40:44] can go make a movie and try to sell it.
[40:46] If they could, like I've said before,
[40:47] Disney would buy all the piece. So they
[40:49] go through all of these things or he
[40:51] goes through all the buildout. He goes
[40:53] through the complex parts. So what I did
[40:55] was
[40:56] okay show me now the companies in the
[40:58] stack behind the infrastructure that he
[41:00] referenced in particular uh that would
[41:03] that is the the biggest problem. So
[41:05] these are all companies that you should
[41:06] be looking at. This is all the part that
[41:08] he's saying is going to have massive
[41:10] supply issues. Most of these are
[41:11] semiconductor companies. Um and that's
[41:14] the issue. The green one I want to
[41:15] highlight here is ASML. The monopoly in
[41:18] EUV lithography the single most
[41:20] irreplaceable company in the AI chip
[41:22] production. This is why I keep saying
[41:24] that ASML not only benefits from the
[41:27] growth of this and why I like it as my
[41:29] favorite stock for next year or from
[41:31] this point on for the next year where
[41:33] Micron was my favorite for this year.
[41:36] Focus the ASML way. It's a book that
[41:39] goes through an unparalleled analysis of
[41:42] ASML's extraordinary rise and the
[41:45] geopolitical place they put themselves
[41:47] in. They are at the center of a
[41:49] geopolitical storm between the United
[41:51] States, China, and Europe. If you don't
[41:53] know about ASML, it's a cool thing to go
[41:55] look because of where we are right now.
[41:58] Um, in systems terms, ASML represents
[42:01] the choke point in the architecture of
[42:04] modern comput computation without its
[42:06] machines. Um, it's worth going through
[42:09] these machines are about $200 million.
[42:13] So, think about how how expensive. 200
[42:16] million, not two million, 200 million.
[42:19] Um, they're not easily replaceable. So
[42:22] when you go through this what I said is
[42:23] given how many companies are trying to
[42:24] build new chips for placing AI in the
[42:27] entire industrial and consumer
[42:28] infrastructure of machines does ASML
[42:31] benefit from the next stage of AI for
[42:33] NPUs and edge devices. So again I've
[42:35] I've mentioned them as one of the most
[42:37] important when you're constantly trying
[42:39] to come up with new chips. You need to
[42:41] use their machines for every chip that's
[42:43] being made. So instead of just using the
[42:46] same thing over and over, if you do a
[42:47] new one, well then you're going to have
[42:49] to use a new machine from the stuff that
[42:51] I've learned. So the demand for them
[42:53] goes higher. So you get all these parts.
[42:56] They're also involved in another part of
[42:57] the MPUs. Basically, we're going to need
[43:00] so many different types of chips that
[43:02] they're going to be brought into it.
[43:04] Now, quantum, there was a breakthrough.
[43:06] Again, I didn't get any calls on Bitcoin
[43:09] this week on it, but Quantum is making
[43:11] advancements. That's another reason why
[43:12] I'm going to continue to remain on the
[43:14] optimistic side that China and the US
[43:16] are going to come to an agreement
[43:17] because I believe it's mutual mass
[43:19] destruction. Uh and the only way I see
[43:21] this not as an option is if China really
[43:23] wants to invade Taiwan now before the US
[43:25] can build up some munitions and before
[43:26] quantum. So the China US thing to me is
[43:29] a infle a major inflection point.
[43:32] Anything comes out of it that comes to
[43:33] an a trade agreement where the countries
[43:35] are going to work together. Even if it
[43:37] ends up breaking in two years, I think
[43:38] the stock market is just going to run
[43:40] because I think it's being held back
[43:41] like a Kentucky Derby horse that wants
[43:43] to run. XBankers get paid to build the
[43:45] bots. Former financiers are earning $150
[43:49] an hour to train OpenAI's models to do
[43:51] the junior banking analyst jobs. This
[43:53] was out as a story this week. It's a big
[43:55] deal. Um, and I when I say it, Mker, I
[43:58] told you this is what everything is
[44:00] doing. They're bringing experts in to
[44:02] train the models so that they can give
[44:03] the models or sell the models to the
[44:05] banks so they can get rid of the people.
[44:07] This is what's happening. Humans are
[44:09] augmenting and they're being involved
[44:11] because as they get fired, they can go
[44:13] get a job with OpenAI, making some money
[44:15] in the intern, but also learning how to
[44:17] use the thing. You learn how to use it,
[44:18] then you can get a job. Open AAI just
[44:21] said the quiet part. They aren't
[44:22] building chat bots anymore. They're
[44:24] building an automated researcher, a
[44:25] system that can discover new ideas, run
[44:27] its own experiments, and push progress
[44:28] in every science. recursive learning. We
[44:30] are getting to the recursive learning
[44:32] point. Now, this port this New York
[44:35] Times had an article um that was leaked.
[44:40] Amazon is planning to replace roughly
[44:42] half a million jobs with robots in the
[44:44] next few years. Half a million jobs
[44:47] according to a report. Now, some of
[44:49] those would be new hires that are not
[44:50] happening. They employ about 1.2 million
[44:53] workers in the US, second only to
[44:55] Walmart. You're talking about replacing.
[44:58] So, this was a leaked report. If you
[45:01] haven't seen the robots they do, it's
[45:03] coming, guys. AI and robots will replace
[45:05] all jobs. Elon Musk working will be
[45:07] optional, like growing your own
[45:09] vegetables instead of buying them from
[45:11] the store. I know this is hard for
[45:13] people to do. This is the world that you
[45:15] have to start thinking about, not just
[45:16] for you, but as I said, I'm getting more
[45:19] into helping the kids because there's a
[45:21] lot of people that aren't going to
[45:22] change.
[45:24] reminder the job losses started chat GBT
[45:27] earnings are growing hiring is going
[45:30] down
[45:32] this is where I want to start the
[45:34] training for people so this is lesson
[45:36] one um if you haven't seen this
[45:38] commencement speech uh from Admiral
[45:40] McCraven he gave it in 2014 at the
[45:43] University of Texas one of the best if
[45:46] not the best definitely in the top two
[45:47] for me along with the Steve Jobs
[45:49] commencement speech um he put this book
[45:52] out afterwards make your that he goes
[45:55] through in there and everything that he
[45:57] talked about in my opinion is the way
[45:58] that I am going to help people with
[46:01] artificial intelligence. This is what is
[46:03] going to be part of my job. Whether it's
[46:05] businesses through the consulting side
[46:06] or whether it's creating videos to show
[46:08] people I do things and trying to get
[46:10] people to think if this said make your
[46:13] bed, which is what he went through, I'm
[46:16] going to convert it into how you use AI.
[46:18] So, empowerment in the age of AI lessons
[46:20] from Admiral McCraven. Again, me
[46:23] brainstorming with AI converting his 10
[46:27] lessons that he mentions. Make your bed
[46:29] every day. Start your day with
[46:30] discipline and success. Get a win to
[46:32] start your day. Even when it's hard,
[46:34] even when you've had a bad day, you make
[46:36] your bed every day. Simple things. Start
[46:38] small every day. Use AI daily. Even for
[46:40] five minutes. Small wins compound. I'm
[46:42] telling you that is a fact. I've learned
[46:44] so much doing it. The more you continue
[46:46] to use it, even if it's for five
[46:48] minutes, and start your day that way. I
[46:51] use it all day long. And when I say all
[46:52] day long, there's almost no hour, just
[46:54] like I don't go an hour without walking
[46:57] 250 steps minimum. There's not an hour
[46:59] that passes where I don't use artificial
[47:01] intelligence. I don't have hour
[47:02] meetings. And if I'm in a meeting, I
[47:03] will eventually have it run something
[47:05] while it's going on. Don't be afraid of
[47:07] the circus. Hard moments build
[47:08] resilience. Embrace the learning curve.
[47:10] AI mastery comes from persistence. You
[47:13] get better as you keep using it. And if
[47:16] you go backwards, you ask another
[47:18] question, you come back, you will get
[47:19] better. Be your very best in the darkest
[47:22] moment. Keep your composure under
[47:23] stress. Stay calm and uncertainty. Use
[47:24] AI to organize thoughts and build
[47:26] clarity before I do any presentation. I
[47:28] did this one one this week for a pension
[47:30] plan. I always prepare using AI. I
[47:34] prepare organizing my thoughts just like
[47:35] something like this. But then I also
[47:37] once I have this, I go out and talk to
[47:39] it about this. It quizzes me on it. It
[47:41] goes through it. As I'm walking, I'm
[47:43] speaking to it. I walk down man or down
[47:45] Park Avenue. Nobody knows that I'm not
[47:48] talking to a human. They think I am. I'm
[47:50] talking to Open AI. Don't ever ever ring
[47:53] the bell. Never quit. Stay curious for
[47:56] life. AI learning never ends. It
[47:57] compounds. I can't say it loud enough.
[47:59] That is your first lesson. I will expand
[48:01] upon that in videos. Um the team on the
[48:05] weekly roundup for forward guidance. I
[48:09] just wanted to bring up I like these
[48:10] guys. I've told you they are the best
[48:12] macro thing to listen to. Again, the one
[48:15] thing they never talk about, or at least
[48:18] if they do, I haven't heard it. So,
[48:19] these guys are unique. They're very,
[48:22] very good uh Fed watchers. They're very
[48:25] good macroeconomic people, and they're
[48:28] excellent crypto people. The part
[48:30] they're missing is to me the most
[48:32] important part, it's the bridge between
[48:34] the two, which is artificial
[48:35] intelligence. The only way you can truly
[48:37] understand what's happening in the
[48:38] traditional f traditional macro world
[48:40] because it's being disrupted by
[48:41] artificial intelligence. It's having the
[48:43] job impacts. It's having the profit
[48:45] margin impacts. So if they say
[48:46] stagflation, I say stagflation, yes, but
[48:50] not when you have AI. I say jobs, yes,
[48:53] they suffer. That's the right lane.
[48:56] That's the slowmoving lane. The left
[48:58] lane is where the profit margins go in.
[48:59] That's where the building is happening.
[49:01] It eventually all ends up in Bitcoin. So
[49:04] what I did was say here's my view which
[49:06] again I'm not going to go through but
[49:08] the abundance era in the way that I
[49:09] describe it which open a or chatpt has
[49:12] gemini has perplexity has because I've
[49:15] put my endgame I'm a systems thinker I
[49:18] think about what the world is going to
[49:19] look like in 2045 and I walk backwards
[49:21] and then I watch AI as it's moving I
[49:23] compare the two and everything that
[49:25] shows up we're very similar on this. The
[49:28] big thing is exponential innovation
[49:30] compresses time.
[49:33] The traditional finance world is all
[49:35] based on time. The reason there are no
[49:37] more cycles, business cycles, recession
[49:39] cycles, which I've been preaching since
[49:41] 2013, is because time is going to zero.
[49:45] Today is yesterday. By the time I do
[49:48] this, so many more things have happened.
[49:50] So many models have happened, so many
[49:51] advancements have happened. There is
[49:53] something going on that's different. The
[49:55] entire fiat system is based on slowm
[49:58] moving time. So when time goes
[50:00] parabolic, the entire system breaks.
[50:02] There will be no leverage in the future.
[50:04] Zero. The entire system is built on
[50:07] leverage. How do we go from a leveraged
[50:08] world where there's debt and deficits to
[50:10] an unlevered world? How does that
[50:12] happen?
[50:14] That's part of the thing that makes this
[50:15] fun to think about and to go through.
[50:18] So, here's the winner at the end. My
[50:20] opinion, Bitcoin. So, Bitcoin is still
[50:23] basically right around where it was a
[50:26] year ago. So, we hit here in December.
[50:27] We haven't done anything. Even though
[50:29] year to date we are up 20%, last year we
[50:31] were up a ton. It's fine. Uh we're
[50:34] starting to get a little technical MACD
[50:35] buy signal on the dailies. Uh we've got
[50:39] V all the way down here. So I'm very
[50:41] comfortable knowing that when we peaked
[50:43] at the 4-year cycle and this is the
[50:45] 90-day V. So this is a little backward
[50:48] looking. Whether it's here or whether
[50:50] it's here, we were pretty much at one
[50:52] year highs and VSS. Right now if we're
[50:53] peaking near the all-time highs slightly
[50:55] below it, it's not happening with the
[50:57] lowest V there. Bitcoin has actually
[50:59] become boring. It's also very negative.
[51:02] The space is horrible. There's really
[51:04] it's it's been a brutal year for crypto
[51:07] relative to what you'd expect. And yes,
[51:08] I know Bitcoin's up 20%. In fact, 19 as
[51:12] of when I did this, it was at one 11.
[51:15] Yeah, 111 and a half. Um, but after two
[51:18] years of over 100%.
[51:21] Now,
[51:23] Galaxy reported earnings and they
[51:25] highlighted the sale of more than 80,000
[51:27] Bitcoin representing this was public
[51:29] representing a $9 billion notional value
[51:32] as part of a broader estate planning
[51:34] strategy for a single client. This was
[51:36] one of the largest Bitcoin trades ever.
[51:38] So, if you're trying to figure out why
[51:39] Bitcoin is not going higher with all of
[51:40] the buying we're hearing from retail,
[51:42] all the buying we're hearing from uh
[51:44] these treasury companies, possibly
[51:46] governments, other firms and analysts
[51:48] confirmed that long-term holders, OG G
[51:50] Whales, have ramped up disposals on
[51:51] chain, showing 240,000 sold by long-term
[51:54] holders just in the past month.
[51:57] This is an October thing. So, this
[51:59] doesn't include the sales that we were
[52:00] talking about there. Um, so you're
[52:03] talking about now you're getting into
[52:04] the 30s, 40s of billions, maybe even
[52:06] more. So OGs are getting out and then
[52:09] you've got this thing which goes
[52:10] through. Bitcoin have sold over 240,000
[52:12] over the past 30 days. Largest wave
[52:14] profit tailing since January of 25. And
[52:16] this is all with the market at highs
[52:18] again. You've got the four-year. The
[52:20] biggest problem to me I could give you a
[52:22] bunch of reasons why people will be
[52:24] bailing out of Bitcoin right now. Uh
[52:26] people are scared of the four-year
[52:27] cycle. I've heard that. I talked about
[52:28] it last week. I think the other thing
[52:30] that is going on is people may think
[52:33] that Bitcoin's lost kind of its ability.
[52:34] It's just not sexy right now. You've got
[52:36] gold going up faster. You've got the AI
[52:38] trade which has driven attention.
[52:40] Without retail, the institutions I you
[52:43] they don't they're not panic buyers.
[52:45] They don't push things. They're just
[52:46] there. On the sell side, we have
[52:49] according to Mike Novagrats when he
[52:51] spoke uh on the Raul Powell episode, he
[52:54] not only had sellers, he constantly has
[52:57] overwriters. So, there's been V
[52:59] compression. You've got people selling
[53:00] call options. You've got the Bitcoin
[53:02] miners that are continually selling call
[53:03] options. If you don't have retail
[53:05] involved in the space, it's not
[53:06] surprising to me that it's sitting
[53:07] there. So, right now, you have all of
[53:09] these people looking for yield and
[53:11] people basically thinking that Bitcoin
[53:12] has reached a point where they've got
[53:13] better place to put their money and the
[53:15] buyers, they're just there and they come
[53:17] in every day in small amounts. The
[53:19] question is when are we going to break
[53:20] out? So, the part that I care about is
[53:23] that every day there's more and more
[53:25] crypto visions being laid out by the
[53:27] banks because of the regulatory side.
[53:29] That's the part that matters to me. The
[53:30] regulatory push is coming. It's a
[53:32] slowmoving thing. We haven't gotten the
[53:34] market structure act done, but it's
[53:36] happening slowly but surely. I've talked
[53:38] about comparing this to the time of the
[53:40] internet era, coming out of 2002 to the
[53:44] the dot bubble and coming out of it. We
[53:47] are, in my opinion, next year is going
[53:49] to be like 2007 or 2008 from when the
[53:52] iPhone came out. You're going to have an
[53:54] investment boom that's going to go on in
[53:56] these things because of AI agents, which
[53:58] I think is the trigger point. the
[54:00] payments MCP. This is Coinboy is
[54:03] launching its payments uh model context
[54:06] protocol. Easiest way for agents to get
[54:08] on chain. So the merging of agents and
[54:10] crypto is going to start happening.
[54:13] You've seen all the things on stable
[54:15] coins and that's why the timing I wrote
[54:16] this in Substack this week. If you
[54:18] haven't read it and you're curious about
[54:19] stable coins and again if you're in the
[54:21] right-hand lane of the slowmoving tradey
[54:23] world and you haven't wanted to get into
[54:24] the fastmoving left side, I highly
[54:26] recommend reading this. I tried to
[54:28] simplify it in a way that made it easy
[54:29] and I used two podcasts, both from
[54:32] Moonshots that were crypto forward. You
[54:34] can go listen to both of them. I think
[54:36] there's an important event going on as I
[54:37] finish this up in Argentina happening
[54:39] this weekend. uh there are elections and
[54:43] if it ends up going badly for Malay
[54:46] where he basically the disapproval of
[54:50] him shows up I think Argentina is going
[54:53] to be the first one of why Argentines
[54:56] are turning to crypto in the latest peso
[54:58] crisis. So you've already seen this go
[55:02] on. But remember here is the Argentine
[55:06] bonds. The white line Bessant comes in
[55:08] to give money. If the election goes
[55:12] badly, I would expect the bonds to break
[55:13] down below the lows and this becomes
[55:15] another story and Argentina goes through
[55:17] another phase of this. If somehow or
[55:18] another he wins, the US will give him 20
[55:20] billion. You can stabilize and maybe he
[55:22] can work through this. But I think the
[55:24] only way he's going to work through it
[55:25] is if he moves into what this orange
[55:27] line is, which is El Salvador bonds. So
[55:30] look how correlated they were all year.
[55:32] So two countries that historically have
[55:34] had some problems with their bonds and
[55:36] oh wow, right around here. Argentina
[55:39] starts fall off, but El Salvador just
[55:41] keeps going. Bitcoin,
[55:44] fiat. So I think this is a big story,
[55:47] but I also think it's a big story for
[55:49] another reason. Why is China spooked by
[55:51] stable coins?
[55:55] US rich uh US or EU is worried about
[55:58] stable coins from a riskmanagement
[55:59] basis. Systemic bankr run risk hangs
[56:01] over stable coin bills in Congress.
[56:04] Remember Silicon Valley Bank, the second
[56:06] biggest bank failure in US history took
[56:09] less than 48 hours.
[56:11] Do not be surprised
[56:14] if Argentina does not run into the same
[56:16] problem after this election. if their
[56:18] currency starts falling faster and their
[56:20] bonds are falling. Right now, the locals
[56:23] have the ability of moving into stable
[56:25] coins quickly and you could see just
[56:27] like what happened with Silicon Valley
[56:29] Bank. You could see the locals have a
[56:30] run on the Argentine system. I believe
[56:32] that's what's going on anyway. So, in
[56:34] the US case, they want dollar back
[56:36] stable coins. So, by giving 20 billion
[56:38] or saying they're going to, if they
[56:40] don't do it, they're kind of winning
[56:42] either way. Either they go towards a
[56:43] dollarization or the money comes back
[56:45] through the door in stable coins. This
[56:46] is why you have to read what's going on.
[56:48] This is why Europe and China are so
[56:49] worried about stable coins because at
[56:51] this point they're just a twin for the
[56:53] dollar. Standard charter estimates $1
[56:55] trillion could could exit emerging
[56:57] market bank deposits for US stable coins
[56:59] by 2028. This was something they
[57:01] published not that long ago earlier in
[57:03] the month. I think this is an important
[57:05] story when it comes to Argentina. That's
[57:07] all I got for this week. Uh again, uh
[57:09] subscribe forward to your friends. Let's
[57:12] get the subscriber numbers up. I'm
[57:14] working on the videos to make sure to
[57:15] help you, but more importantly your
[57:17] kids. And for any of the colleges out
[57:19] there who want to reach out to me, I
[57:21] will try to squeeze it in over time. Uh
[57:23] jump on the phone for you an hour, kind
[57:25] of give you some stuff to to work on and
[57:27] some things to think about and do a
[57:29] broader presentation than this. Uh,
[57:31] thanks guys for everything and I will
[57:33] see you next
