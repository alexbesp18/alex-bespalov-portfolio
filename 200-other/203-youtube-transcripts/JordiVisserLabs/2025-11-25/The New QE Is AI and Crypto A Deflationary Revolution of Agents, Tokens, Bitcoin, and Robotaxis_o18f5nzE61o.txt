--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] month in the uh in the books for 2025
[00:03] and another up month. Uh we'll go
[00:06] through that. A lot of stuff came out
[00:08] this week obviously on the macro side
[00:10] with China US and Mag 7 earnings and
[00:13] Powell. I'll go through that. Uh good
[00:16] podcast on the market structure. I think
[00:18] it's time we uh we have a conversation
[00:21] on the market structure because I
[00:23] believe it's going to be a major story
[00:24] for next year if I'm right about what's
[00:27] happening with stable coins, what's
[00:28] about to happen with AI agents, what's
[00:31] continuing uh with the energy issues
[00:35] around AI and the DRAM shortages and the
[00:39] K-shaped economy which is going to force
[00:41] the government in a midterm election
[00:43] year to make sure that uh they're
[00:45] getting votes. So, it's going to be a
[00:47] big year again for the retail uh
[00:51] component of the stock market. And there
[00:53] was good podcast this week on the
[00:55] structure. So, I'm not going to read
[00:56] this for you, but you guys saw it. So,
[00:58] we finally got what effectively
[01:02] is a one-year truce, and that is
[01:05] important for two reasons. One is uh it
[01:08] really truly is the most important part
[01:10] of the tarifftrade fight. So whatever
[01:13] uncertainty was out there for people
[01:15] across the country in terms of the cost
[01:17] of things uh this is going to bring
[01:19] certainty for the next year and the
[01:21] China situation and the stability is
[01:23] still going to mean the trade side. I
[01:25] showed you that the exports from China
[01:27] were down uh 27% to the US that has an
[01:31] impact on transports. I expect the PMIs
[01:34] to move higher this year and I think
[01:36] part of it is going to be a resolution
[01:38] of the uncertainty. Part of it's going
[01:40] to be the build massive build out for
[01:42] the data centers. Uh and with all that
[01:44] together and the fact that a lot of the
[01:46] energy side is going to be the big
[01:48] focus, I think we're going to see PMIs
[01:49] rise up towards 60 during the course of
[01:51] next year, particularly with rates lower
[01:53] around the globe. Uh and the fact that
[01:55] the midterms are coming in, he's going
[01:57] to have to do something. So despite the
[01:59] fact that the markets didn't react the
[02:01] same way, I'll get I'll get into that as
[02:03] we get into the the retail structure.
[02:06] Um, Powell, you know, whatever. They
[02:09] they they cut uh they said December is
[02:12] not a sure thing. I don't know why that
[02:14] would really surprise anyone. Uh markets
[02:17] kind of cared for a second then didn't
[02:18] care. Uh still a 70% chance of a cut in
[02:22] December. I think the most important
[02:24] thing out of this is they've had no
[02:26] data. So when we get the economic data,
[02:29] we'll see how things change and I'm
[02:30] going to go through that terms of the
[02:32] earnings. Uh just remember all year the
[02:34] amount of times you heard people
[02:35] worrying about capex and everyone all
[02:39] three companies early in the week
[02:40] described a rapid ramp in capex. Nothing
[02:44] has changed for the big guys. Uh Amazon
[02:47] reported later and I just want to make
[02:48] sure as we go through these elevated
[02:51] respending spending is a direct response
[02:53] to surging cloud and AI demand. Uh they
[02:57] set expectations for continued capex
[02:59] growth. Looking ahead, we expect our
[03:01] fullear capex to be approximately 125
[03:03] billion in 2025. And we expect that will
[03:06] increase in 2026. It's not about
[03:08] overbuilding, but about responding to
[03:10] customer demand and being ready for the
[03:13] next wave of AI AI and cloud workloads.
[03:15] Just remember, every time you've
[03:16] listened to anyone, including the
[03:19] analysts who reported earlier in the
[03:21] year that Microsoft was cutting back, um
[03:23] don't make that mistake this year. Uh AI
[03:26] is changing everyone's lives. It's
[03:29] impacting businesses more and more every
[03:31] single day and you have to stick with
[03:33] finding the ways to make money off it
[03:35] because the rest of the economy will
[03:36] continue to not produce alpha outside of
[03:38] the S&P. It will be led again by things
[03:41] related to AI and by the speculative
[03:43] side of retail. Um, Alphabet reiterated
[03:47] the same thing. Uh, when we go through a
[03:49] curve like this, the risk of
[03:50] underinvesting is dramatically greater
[03:52] than the risk of overinvesting for us
[03:54] here. Again, you have to remember these
[03:56] things and just not worried. We continue
[03:58] to invest aggressively due to the demand
[03:59] we're seeing from cloud customers. I can
[04:02] say this over and over again. The demand
[04:04] is insatiable. The models are much
[04:06] further ahead than the supply. They
[04:08] can't even release the models. They
[04:10] can't even do the build the models that
[04:12] they want to build because they don't
[04:13] have enough compute. The more that you
[04:16] ignore this, the more that you listen to
[04:17] the bubble talk, the more that you will
[04:19] lose money or sit there and drown in
[04:21] worrying about things. There will be
[04:23] large falls because the market is
[04:25] probably going to go through a true
[04:27] bubble phase. Uh the S&P being up the
[04:30] little amount that it is this year is
[04:32] not a bubble. I've talked about this
[04:33] before. Go back to the NDX, see that it
[04:36] was up 100% in the LTCM year of 1998 and
[04:40] it was up 85% in 1999. We have nothing
[04:43] like that. I do believe we're going to
[04:45] see pockets of that, particularly in
[04:47] crypto in the coming year. Uh but I
[04:49] think you have to pay attention.
[04:50] Short-term RPO of 400 billion shows that
[04:52] our need to build infrastructure is very
[04:53] high. This is Microsoft. This is not an
[04:55] attempt at a new business, but rather a
[04:57] fulfillment cycle for an existing
[05:00] contract.
[05:03] I thought this was a good post. I
[05:04] remember when they complained companies
[05:06] were spending too much on buybacks and
[05:07] not enough on capex. Now they're
[05:09] complaining companies are spending too
[05:11] much on com on capex. I'm going to cover
[05:14] this in a uh a post for 22V this week in
[05:17] terms of the new QE being AI uh and the
[05:21] fact that people have to start realizing
[05:22] that as the expense side is reduced
[05:25] through efficiency, the operating
[05:26] leverage creates a much bigger number
[05:28] for QE. So every bear who fought QE,
[05:31] which is the same bears who were
[05:32] fighting AI, you're going to go through
[05:34] the exact same pain. Earnings, the
[05:37] numbers just keep coming across.
[05:39] uh so far year-over-year 10.7%
[05:43] revenues beating and the numbers are are
[05:46] significantly above nominal GDP at this
[05:48] point which is um surprising we're
[05:50] actually getting the multiplier back on
[05:51] this uh I think it's because a lot of
[05:53] the revenues coming into uh the bigger
[05:56] companies are coming in related to the
[05:58] AI buildout and the US is benefiting
[06:00] again as US exceptionalism regains its
[06:03] its status that people had bailed out on
[06:05] with the dollar also rising uh so
[06:08] revenues news coming through on every
[06:10] level and the earnings growth rate again
[06:12] these are the forecasts and you can see
[06:14] how much the numbers were undersshot and
[06:17] now going higher profit margin in the
[06:20] S&P so far at 12.9 again up from 12.5
[06:24] these are record numbers and it's not
[06:26] anyone's sector obviously tech is a big
[06:28] one but financials which I've
[06:30] highlighted you've got utilities here
[06:32] and then you've got all of these also it
[06:34] doesn't really matter the profit margins
[06:35] continue to go up and here will be the
[06:37] bare case as we come to the end. I'm
[06:39] sure when we end the year, the S&P will
[06:41] have a higher forward PE ratio than any
[06:44] point in the last 25 years. This does
[06:46] not include the bubble peak where it was
[06:48] obviously higher because this is only 25
[06:51] years from where we are today. Uh it
[06:54] wasn't just the AI names and it wasn't
[06:56] just the Mag 7 earnings. I just want to
[06:57] bring up a few. Caterpillar. When a
[07:00] stock like Caterpillar is up 13% in a
[07:02] day, I think it finished up 12% for the
[07:04] day. They're selling generators. They're
[07:07] selling turbines. They're selling
[07:08] compressors. And they're selling
[07:10] autonomous mining vehicles. I've
[07:12] highlighted Pterodine multiple times,
[07:14] especially recently as one of my
[07:15] favorite names that hadn't yet performed
[07:18] to the level when it was about 130 up to
[07:21] 200 for doubling. Um, we're not there
[07:24] yet, but you're starting to see
[07:26] Pterodine had shifted from previous
[07:27] weaknesses in mobile sectors to growth
[07:29] led by AI and computing. We will have an
[07:31] upgrade cycle for both computers and
[07:33] phones coming soon. The same way we'll
[07:36] be having autonomous driving upgrades
[07:38] for the auto side. Uh we will be having
[07:42] all kinds of semiconductors and
[07:44] intelligence put into all industrial
[07:47] components not just the components that
[07:49] were working before. This is a massive
[07:51] massive buildout that which will
[07:53] continue for years. Um Modine
[07:55] manufacturing is another one of these.
[07:57] Um you know the stock opened down I
[08:00] think seven 8% and then climbed its way
[08:03] back. More importantly, it's again
[08:05] everything is around data centers,
[08:06] industrials, it doesn't really matter.
[08:08] So for the month, the S&P was up 2%.
[08:11] Russell 2000 was up 2%. Q's were up much
[08:14] more up at 5% and semis blew away the
[08:17] bunch at 11%. Again, this is the fourth
[08:20] of the last six months with at least 10%
[08:24] gains in semiconductors. If you've
[08:26] missed this trade, don't worry, it's
[08:28] still early. Um the move index
[08:32] V's coming down. So we have stocks going
[08:34] up. We have the Fed cutting rates. We
[08:36] have spreads tightening. We have bond
[08:39] coming down. And people still want to be
[08:42] bearish. Uh financial conditions are
[08:44] easing. And as I go through the job
[08:47] market is not only weak, but it's
[08:49] weakening. Uh gas at the pump added to
[08:52] the financial conditions. The biggest
[08:54] down month in over a year. gas at the
[08:58] pump right around three bucks. All
[08:59] right, this is where I want to go into
[09:00] the market structure. This is a
[09:02] different component. I thought this was
[09:03] really good. Um I've highlighted these
[09:05] guys before. I listen to their weekly
[09:07] roundup every week. Um but there was one
[09:10] topic in particular that I thought was
[09:12] really interesting and this goes for
[09:13] everyone who is uh saying that stupid
[09:16] things are happening and I've heard this
[09:18] from many hedge fund people um at
[09:20] dinners and many hedge fund people that
[09:22] have basically reached out to me. When
[09:24] is the stupid buying by retail going to
[09:26] stop? When are these names that have no
[09:28] revenues going to stop? I am here to
[09:30] tell you it will never stop. This is the
[09:33] market structure changing. And I thought
[09:35] these guys did a good um a good job of
[09:38] covering it. It is not stupid to to to
[09:41] continue to try quantum stocks and
[09:44] energy stocks. These are not long-term
[09:46] holders. These are traders. They are
[09:48] trading numbers on a screen and as long
[09:50] as they're going higher, they're making
[09:52] money. This is the way they've been
[09:53] trained and they use options. And one of
[09:56] the things that's become more important
[09:57] as you go through this is what happened
[09:59] this past week. So what these guys go
[10:01] through is how retail traders are buying
[10:06] massive amounts of calls. They are I I
[10:08] will go through some of the numbers and
[10:10] make sure that you see them. But this is
[10:12] becoming something really important and
[10:13] this is not something new. This has been
[10:15] a trend that's been in place. So I
[10:17] believe next year we will see another
[10:19] one of these GMA the GameStop situations
[10:23] but at a much bigger level. I believe it
[10:26] has started already. I've showed you
[10:28] guys the quant unwind type situation
[10:30] where the most shorted positions have
[10:32] gone higher for Goldman Sachs at an
[10:34] index level and how that has gone up
[10:36] higher than the crowded longs. I think
[10:39] you're going to see a lot of that in the
[10:40] coming year. I think we are in the the
[10:42] midst of something which is going to
[10:45] remind people what a bubble actually is.
[10:47] People have called this a bubble. This
[10:48] is not a bubble. A bubble is when the
[10:51] short side of this stuff where retail
[10:53] has the ability of pressing it and
[10:55] they're buying massive amounts of call
[10:57] options and then as these things break
[10:58] through it, you get a gamma squeeze. I
[11:01] think this is going to happen in
[11:02] Bitcoin. I think this is going to happen
[11:03] in so many areas of the market. And I'm
[11:06] going to go through the reason why
[11:07] because this is a structural shift and
[11:09] that's what these guys covered post an
[11:11] event that is expected like last week.
[11:14] So China US MAG7 Fed everything went
[11:18] good. V gets crushed the market kind of
[11:20] consolidates and goes back down. It
[11:22] becomes a sell the news event. You
[11:24] either get a sell the news event or you
[11:26] get these massive squeezes. So when
[11:28] Caterpillar can go up 12% in a day, when
[11:31] Oracle can go up 30% in a day, I could
[11:34] go through the list of them, there are
[11:36] so many names that are just gapping.
[11:39] I've shown you guys the VIX EQ relative
[11:41] to the VIX. This is the problem is that
[11:44] single stuff because of partly because
[11:46] of AI and the demand shift that's
[11:48] happening, but partly because of the
[11:50] massive option flow. I think you're
[11:52] going to see something next year that's
[11:54] on the back of this. So, I would go
[11:55] listen um to their uh their
[11:58] conversation. I think it's worthwhile.
[12:00] Scott Rubner put this out this week, and
[12:02] this is where I want to just show you.
[12:03] This has been a trend that has been in
[12:04] place for quite some time in terms of
[12:07] the retail option volumes. Uh they're
[12:10] continuing to set new weekly records. Uh
[12:14] this is a gambling community. I remember
[12:16] going through the baby boomers buying
[12:18] every dip. That's where buy the dip
[12:21] really started, which was in the 1990s
[12:24] after the internet side. And again, fast
[12:26] forward, this generation different than
[12:29] the baby boomer generation. But if
[12:31] you're in your 20s and 30s and you're
[12:33] trying to make extra money and this is
[12:35] the way you do it, gambling on whatever
[12:37] you want to gamble on, why not gamble on
[12:39] this? The odds are better in your favor
[12:41] than they are in gambling on sports or
[12:43] things where there's actually
[12:43] efficiency. The stock market goes up 80
[12:46] plus percent of the time and hedge funds
[12:48] are forced to run market neutral and
[12:51] mutual funds are forced on the active
[12:53] manager side to be benchmarked to an
[12:55] index. It's very very difficult when you
[12:57] get to this point that you have two
[12:58] forces passive investing and now retail
[13:02] as the other part. So when you take the
[13:04] barbell and you realize how much smaller
[13:06] the active managers have gotten and more
[13:08] importantly how much more market neutral
[13:10] and factor neutral you've gotten
[13:13] leverage has gone higher and I think
[13:15] we're going to see a GameStop type
[13:16] situation uh which will have huge
[13:18] implications uh zero DTE option date to
[13:22] expiration options amplify the squeezes
[13:25] this is into the S&P now so this has
[13:29] been a major thing as well the zero date
[13:31] options and to give you an idea idea.
[13:34] Here is the GameStop quarter. Here's
[13:37] where we are now. Look at the blue. The
[13:40] blue is the zero DTE options as a of of
[13:44] of flow of the volumes. So look how much
[13:48] you've had barely any change in
[13:50] longerdated options. You really haven't
[13:52] had much change in the one to five week.
[13:55] You've had change in everything that is
[13:57] shortterm in nature. that leads to
[14:00] potential of massive squeeze in terms of
[14:02] gamma. So, as someone who traded options
[14:05] throughout his career at Morgan Stanley
[14:07] and managed the S&P book for the firm in
[14:10] 99 to 2002, I can tell you that having
[14:14] this much zerodday contracts become a
[14:16] dominant force. This is a big deal and I
[14:19] don't think we've seen the the
[14:20] disruption yet that will come. I think
[14:22] it's going to happen because I think the
[14:24] market's been warning you. I think it
[14:26] takes a catalyst to break the
[14:27] concentration. So the concentration has
[14:30] been about a very few amount of names
[14:32] that are participating. If if I'm right
[14:34] about the PMIs and I'm right about the
[14:36] fact that more and more companies are
[14:38] going to benefit from the buildout of
[14:40] the hardware and the material side and
[14:42] we get energy to start going higher.
[14:44] These things are all priced at massive
[14:46] discounts, particularly the Russell 2000
[14:49] relative to the S&P. So whenever I talk
[14:51] to people about small caps, they go, "Oh
[14:53] yeah, this has been a trip." I really
[14:55] don't care. I'm not talking about them
[14:56] winning in the long run. I'm talking
[14:58] about a period of time where this all
[15:00] becomes about squeezes and gambling and
[15:03] positioning where quants and hedge funds
[15:05] are in the same thing on the short side.
[15:07] So just keep keep this in mind when you
[15:11] see this chart which is the gross
[15:13] leverage chart for the long short
[15:15] community. This was put out by Goldman
[15:16] Sachs this week. We're at all-time highs
[15:19] at 220. So this has been going on. So
[15:22] they don't have the GameStop situation
[15:24] here which brought the leverage down.
[15:25] And then we went higher. But you know
[15:27] what this looks like from 22 early 22 on
[15:30] as the leverage has just gone higher. It
[15:33] looks like this. And this is the Goldman
[15:35] Sachs crowded longs versus crowded
[15:38] shorts. It peaked in June and it started
[15:41] to go down. It went down because the
[15:45] quote unquote junk was rallying.
[15:48] I think there's a lot more junk to come
[15:50] to rally. So if you guys are in this
[15:53] stuff, you want to reach out to 22V, I'm
[15:55] happy to spend time. I think this has
[15:57] the potential to be something here. This
[15:59] was the GameStop month. So that's what
[16:01] that index did during that month. It was
[16:04] a 30 plus% fall that was even weaker at
[16:07] some points during it. And remember,
[16:09] this was all about a few names. I think
[16:12] this is going to happen in a much bigger
[16:14] scale. And so here we are four of the
[16:16] last five months, but in particular,
[16:20] it's been a while that this unwind has
[16:22] been happening. And this is all in my
[16:24] opinion because of AI and what it's
[16:26] doing to the market. It is allowing
[16:28] companies that have had no business. And
[16:30] I'm going to go through some of them or
[16:31] at least one of them today where they're
[16:33] now going to have AI agents and their
[16:35] profitability will change overnight. And
[16:37] the second that they start to squeeze
[16:39] higher and the quant strategies which
[16:41] are based on momentum need to buy,
[16:43] you'll have retail all over them. That's
[16:45] what they jump into. They're into
[16:47] momentum and quants turn into momentum
[16:49] as well. It will force hedge funds as
[16:51] well. So for positions and again
[16:55] this is IWM over SPY. This was all
[16:58] leading into the GameStop situation.
[17:00] That is the peak of the GameStop
[17:01] situation. You get a move like that in
[17:04] IWM versus S&P, same thing. you're going
[17:06] to knock a lot of funds out of business.
[17:08] I would be very wary again of being
[17:10] short small caps and I would start to
[17:12] pay attention to what retail is doing
[17:14] and what the quant strategies have been
[17:15] doing with fundamentally garbage
[17:18] companies that are all of a sudden
[17:19] seeing a benefit. PMIs have been below
[17:21] 50 for the exact same amount of time
[17:24] that that trade has worked. PMIs, if
[17:26] they go up to 60, that's a diffusion
[17:29] index. You have a lot of companies that
[17:30] are benefiting because a lot of
[17:32] industries are benefiting and a lot of
[17:33] those are on the manufacturing side.
[17:36] Rebel Pal did an interview with Ahmad
[17:38] Mustak this week. Very good one. I'm
[17:41] just going to go through a few of the
[17:42] highlights. Um, and I'm going to
[17:44] highlight to you that if even if you're
[17:45] only going to listen to a little bit, I
[17:47] would listen from minute 12 to minute
[17:49] 22.
[17:51] The tipping point for cognitive work,
[17:55] the deflationary shock. This is to me
[17:58] what is the most important thing for
[18:00] everyone who has not spent the time on
[18:01] AI to get up to speed real quick. every
[18:04] I wrote two paces on labor this week. I
[18:07] do not think people fully grasp what is
[18:09] happening and what is going to continue
[18:11] to happen. We are at the beginning
[18:12] stages. I talked about inference in May
[18:15] of this year. It was a great timing for
[18:17] it. AI agents are all based on coming as
[18:20] inference grows. We've seen the tokens
[18:22] grow. We've now seen the cloud demands
[18:24] grow. That means the AI agents are
[18:26] coming. And when they come, you're going
[18:28] to see profit margins shift for
[18:29] companies. And you're going to see those
[18:30] margins shift very abruptly. And I'll
[18:32] show you some of those. Particularly if
[18:34] the PMIs go higher and we have nominal
[18:35] GDP go up a little bit where topline
[18:37] revenue grows, you're going to have some
[18:38] dramatic shifts where you're going to
[18:40] get some topline, but the expense side
[18:43] with the operating leverage that allows
[18:45] things to change quickly. And when a
[18:47] company embraces AI and they get one
[18:49] benefit, it just continues forever or at
[18:52] least for the next couple years. So on
[18:54] the reasoning breakthrough, AI models
[18:56] can now solve Olympian level problems in
[18:57] physics, math, and coding. They're
[18:59] winning all of these competitions now.
[19:01] So for anyone that ever reads anything
[19:04] again that says they're not doing
[19:05] anything, the models aren't getting any
[19:07] better. This was not even a possibility.
[19:09] This means we're getting closer to AGI.
[19:11] Autonomous agents arrive. This is all
[19:13] from the 12 minute to 16 minute. We're
[19:16] going to have the cost collapse. The
[19:17] price of AI thinking has plunged from
[19:19] about $600 per token to 5.
[19:23] Cognitive labor. Anything done behind a
[19:25] keyboard is becoming virtually free.
[19:27] Tasks like research, data analysis, work
[19:29] can all be automated. Think about how
[19:31] many service jobs that is. So far, we've
[19:32] talked about coding. Now, we're getting
[19:34] into lawyers and everything else. I've
[19:36] shown you how they've been training them
[19:37] on experts. As intelligence gets
[19:40] cheaper, the output energy soarses,
[19:42] creating the most powerful deflationary
[19:44] shock in history. The cost of
[19:46] intelligence is collapsing. The shift
[19:47] from promoting to autonomous agents
[19:49] marks the true beginning. And I agree.
[19:51] I've called this the beginning of stage
[19:53] two where digital employees replace
[19:56] human employees followed by humanoids,
[19:59] physical employees replace him. That is
[20:01] all in the next three years,
[20:06] cognitive labor collapse. This is the
[20:09] deflationary shock.
[20:11] Everything collapses. You get a massive
[20:13] productivity game. When intelligence
[20:14] becomes abundant, prices and wages tied
[20:16] to co cognitive work fall. This is the
[20:18] largest deflationary event ever as
[20:21] knowledge work, the backbone of modern
[20:23] economies, gets automated. Private firms
[20:26] respond first. They start with hiring
[20:28] freezes. That's what we've seen now.
[20:30] Then they get into role restructuring.
[20:31] I'll get into some of that as AI
[20:34] replaces middle to office work.
[20:35] Government, healthcare, and regulator
[20:37] industries will be slower to change.
[20:41] We are entering an era where the
[20:42] marginal cost of intelligence is
[20:44] effectively zero driving a structural
[20:46] deflation that will redefine work
[20:47] productivity and value creation across
[20:49] the entire global economy.
[20:52] Emod describes a world where almost all
[20:54] cognitive work be done by AI at a
[20:56] negligible cost a few dollars per work
[20:59] equivalent per year.
[21:03] That means total economic output
[21:05] expanding rapidly while human labor
[21:07] input falls towards zero. You hit an
[21:09] economic singularity call comparing it
[21:12] to a black hole in economics where the
[21:14] normal equations don't work. Even the
[21:16] Fed doesn't make any sense anymore.
[21:18] You're already seeing this. Simon
[21:19] Kousnets, I've brought this up in
[21:21] speeches. I've brought this up in my
[21:23] writings for well over a year now. He
[21:26] created GDP. He was brought in to do it.
[21:28] And while he created, he said it was
[21:29] never designed to measure welfare
[21:31] welfare or intangible value and breaks
[21:33] down when production decouples from
[21:35] human labor.
[21:37] That's where we are. This is the
[21:38] ultimate paradox of abundance. So, I
[21:40] gave my abundance speech last week on
[21:42] Pomp. I'm writing things about it more
[21:44] and more. Um, if you want to listen to a
[21:47] great podcast, I actually wrote a a
[21:50] Substack on this. Just go to YouTube,
[21:52] type in the Move 37. This is obviously
[21:54] in reference to Alph Go. Uh, Paul Roer,
[21:57] he has a weekly podcast called AI
[22:00] Intelligence. I've referenced things
[22:01] from it in the past. I always leave with
[22:03] something. He just gave this
[22:05] presentation uh for 45 minutes. Absolute
[22:08] mustwatch as far as I'm concerned for
[22:10] people go on YouTube. It led to not this
[22:13] paper. I wrote a paper at 22V the future
[22:16] of labor AI incentives and the end of
[22:18] work as we know it. Um this was all on
[22:20] the back of the Amazon leaked internal
[22:22] plan to replace 500,000 workers. But
[22:24] then I did write this substack as well.
[22:26] Um which used a lot of the information
[22:29] that I got from that podcast I
[22:30] referenced with Paul Rozer. Um, for
[22:32] those of you who reach out, uh, I am
[22:34] going to try and find a way to get you
[22:35] guys links, uh, on a payw wall. Um, in
[22:38] terms of everything that I do here, I'm
[22:40] still going to go through the podcast
[22:41] and and and the YouTube and the Substack
[22:44] and everything the way that I have, but
[22:45] I'm getting so many requests on having
[22:48] this so people can file it. Then I'm
[22:50] going to figure a way to do it. Um, this
[22:52] Substack gets into again a lot of the
[22:55] things that's preparing people that if
[22:57] you want to survive for as long as you
[22:59] can make money, you have to be using
[23:02] artificial intelligence. It's a
[23:03] collaborative effort. Um, this is where
[23:06] the job situation to me just we have to
[23:08] go through. So Torstston
[23:11] put this out at Apollo uh back earlier
[23:15] in the year and he highlighted this. Fed
[23:17] starts raising interest rates and that's
[23:19] the reason why. This is exactly the
[23:20] reason why every economist I talk to, I
[23:23] have yet to talk to one who has either
[23:27] spent the time on AI or understands
[23:28] what's happening. If you're one of those
[23:30] people listening and you still doubt it,
[23:33] you better spend the time at some point
[23:35] because it's the only way you're going
[23:36] to be able to a make money and second
[23:38] save yourself going forward. This is
[23:40] going to just accelerate at an
[23:41] exponential pace. So like I said last
[23:43] week, if you want to stay in the slow
[23:45] lane, stay in the slow lane. This is
[23:47] such a dramatic change in terms of total
[23:49] employment growth in the mag 7 all of
[23:51] these years as they were booming in
[23:53] terms of their revenues. Their revenues
[23:55] are still double digits and now they're
[23:58] not they're not hiring. And this is the
[24:00] prior three years. This line here is
[24:02] when chat GPT started.
[24:05] So, Amazon,
[24:08] aside from the 500,000 that we heard
[24:10] about in terms of over the course of a
[24:12] few years, [clears throat]
[24:13] they officially laid off 14,000
[24:16] corporate workers with plans for a total
[24:18] of 30,000.
[24:21] Their stocks flying, their business is
[24:23] flying. They have, as they said, they
[24:26] cannot meet the demand that they have.
[24:30] Think about that. They say they can't
[24:32] meet the demand. They don't have enough
[24:34] capacity.
[24:36] They need more intelligence. They don't
[24:39] need more people. Amazon just might
[24:41] replace 500,000 human humans with
[24:44] robots. That was last week's leak story.
[24:46] And this is from July when they proudly
[24:50] said they hit their 1 millionth robot.
[24:53] This is not something new. This has been
[24:56] going on. And this is why you can see
[24:58] this. So this is the employment chart
[25:00] overlaid with the revenue chart. Their
[25:03] revenue has not only not slowed, it's
[25:05] actually accelerating, but their job
[25:08] situation is unchanged since basically
[25:10] 2020. And this is before the layoffs
[25:12] that just went on.
[25:15] UPS cuts 48,000. So remember, we're now
[25:20] trying to be um economists are trying to
[25:22] bring us down to where, you know, well,
[25:24] the unemployment rate will stay the same
[25:25] if we're only getting 50 to 70,000 jobs
[25:28] a month. Now UBS is cutting 48,000
[25:31] jobs.
[25:34] Whimo robo taxis in Austin are busier
[25:36] than 99% of human drivers.
[25:40] Chipotle reported. So with all this
[25:42] weakness going on and we've heard that
[25:44] it's been hurting the lower-end consumer
[25:47] plus the lower-end consumer is getting
[25:48] hurt by the inflation side. So Chipotle
[25:52] reported stock gets hammered and in
[25:53] there earlier this year as consumer
[25:55] sentiment declined we saw a broad-based
[25:56] pullback in frequency among all income
[25:59] cohorts. Since then the gap has widened
[26:01] with low to middle income guest further
[26:04] reducing frequency. We believe this is
[26:06] guests with household income below
[26:08] 100,000 that represents 40% of our total
[26:10] sales.
[26:13] The the group that is particularly
[26:15] challenged is the 25 to 345year-old.
[26:18] Those are the ones being hurt. This
[26:19] group is faced with several headwinds
[26:21] including unemployment, increased
[26:24] student loan payments, and slower wage
[26:26] growth
[26:28] that consumers under pressure and they
[26:29] feel the pinch and we feel the pullback.
[26:33] They specifically mention who this is
[26:36] painful for. Uh I want to reiterate
[26:39] something I said on Pomp yesterday. You
[26:40] have to understand uh this cohort
[26:45] had a belief when they went to school
[26:47] that they would not only be having a
[26:49] job, they'd be in a position that it
[26:51] would grow every year by more than
[26:53] inflation. That is the reason why you go
[26:55] to college and you get it. Not just to
[26:57] get a job, but to actually see your
[26:59] wages grow. Now, what you're talking
[27:01] about is it's harder to get a job out of
[27:03] college. They're getting pressured on
[27:05] the AI side and then they have to
[27:07] transition to another job. But the
[27:09] corporate ladder is that exponential
[27:11] innovation is always in your face as a
[27:13] headwind. And that means there'll be
[27:14] more digital employees in two years,
[27:16] double that in three years. That's the
[27:19] whole point of this is it never gets
[27:21] better. So when I hear people like
[27:22] economists not talking about this and
[27:26] trying to pretend to sell you guys goods
[27:29] that well the Fed shouldn't be cutting
[27:30] rates because we're going to have
[27:32] inflation and unemployment rate is low.
[27:34] The labor force participation rate
[27:36] continues to fall. And as I said, I am
[27:39] renaming the labor participation rate
[27:41] officially as the rate of people that
[27:44] need to work.
[27:48] It it has just become a problem that is
[27:49] only going to worsen. It has been
[27:51] falling since the rise of exponent
[27:53] innovation. That's why I traveled to
[27:55] Silicon Valley in 2013 to make sure I
[27:57] never again separated the fact of what
[27:59] software was meant to do, which was
[28:01] replace people. AI is not software, but
[28:04] AI is intelligence. And that's why this
[28:06] is going to be five times worse than
[28:08] what happened from 2010 to 2020. And go
[28:10] look at what happened to the labor
[28:11] participation rate. Go look at what
[28:13] happened to profit margins. We're going
[28:15] to see that at least for the next 3 to 5
[28:17] years. McDonald's co um confirmed what
[28:20] Chipotle said and they specifically said
[28:23] two-tier economy. If you're upper income
[28:24] earning over 100,000, things are good.
[28:26] What we see in the middle is actually a
[28:28] different story. Foot traffic among
[28:30] lower income consumers has decreased by
[28:32] double digits. recessionary type things.
[28:36] Middle and lower income consumers are
[28:38] avoiding purchasing merchandise.
[28:40] Walmart, Target, we've seen a consumer
[28:42] that had no choice but to spend. We've
[28:43] seen inflationary pressure across
[28:44] household spending. Kohl's consumer
[28:46] spending. This is across the earning
[28:49] side of every company that's coming out.
[28:51] France put this out. Uh I agree. I'd
[28:54] never seen anything like this. If you
[28:55] guys follow the conference board's data,
[28:57] this gets more granular for the jobs
[28:59] hard to get. Jobs plentiful. And again,
[29:01] you can see the baby boomers, no problem
[29:04] yet. Gen X, this is clearly by age with
[29:07] the worst one being Gen Z. So, they're
[29:11] having trouble getting jobs, they're
[29:12] having trouble finding them. Uh, race
[29:15] against the machine, a adoption, senior
[29:18] employees, fine. Junior employees, same
[29:20] same thing. Uh I just want to show this
[29:22] because again the reason the economy
[29:25] feels like a recession and technically
[29:27] it is. We have a two-tiered economy not
[29:29] just in terms of what people are making.
[29:31] This is personal income year-over-year
[29:34] 1.4% X transfer payments. So X
[29:40] government handouts 1.4%. It had been up
[29:43] at four and change had moved down here.
[29:45] So obviously we had the spike during
[29:47] COVID. But you can see that during the
[29:49] prior time, this was like a 3 to 4%
[29:52] number for the most part um during the
[29:54] prior decade. We're now down at 1.4%.
[29:57] Here's what it looks like when you
[29:58] overlay it with nominal GDP. Nominal GDP
[30:00] is up at 5% and we are seeing
[30:02] year-over-year income X transfer
[30:05] payments. That's about 17 trillion is
[30:07] only growing at 1.4%. How's the economy
[30:10] floating? Well, because the transfer
[30:12] payments are growing at 9%. So, the
[30:15] government transfer payments are still
[30:16] growing year-over-year at 9%. That
[30:19] number is about 5 trillion. So, you have
[30:21] 17 trillion on this number growing at
[30:24] 1.4%.
[30:26] You have 9% growth in transfer payments.
[30:29] And this is the way that you can see it.
[30:31] 17 trillion. This thing is growing at
[30:33] 9%. 9% on this is a big number. So, the
[30:37] government is basically created a
[30:39] situation and those transfer payments
[30:41] are getting to be a higher number of the
[30:43] two of them combined. We're now up to
[30:44] about 30%. Um, it's growing rapidly.
[30:47] It's like having Bitcoin in your
[30:49] portfolio versus any asset. If you leave
[30:51] it for five years, it ends up as the
[30:52] biggest waiting in your portfolio, even
[30:54] if you don't do anything. Um, I just
[30:56] want to highlight again what I showed
[30:58] last week and the reason I'm going
[30:59] through this. This is temp employees
[31:01] overlaid with earnings per share of the
[31:02] S&P earnings per share going up temp
[31:06] hiring going down and this is chat GPT
[31:09] chat GPT and then this is the jolts
[31:11] higher. So there's no doubt right now
[31:13] that that's what's happening going on.
[31:16] So what are CEOs talking about now as we
[31:18] come out of Q3? The agentic future
[31:23] agent deployment accelerates as
[31:25] organizations build confidence through
[31:26] early wins. Here's the company. CH
[31:29] Robinson, CHRW, a trucker, launches an
[31:33] AI agent to help shippers adapt. The
[31:35] stock is up 50% in the last four months.
[31:39] Here's what they said. Our fleet of AI
[31:41] agents are not only improving our
[31:42] productivity and operational
[31:44] performance, but automating tasks that
[31:45] free up our industryleading talent to
[31:47] focus on more strategic blah blah blah.
[31:49] Operating margin increased to 31% up 680
[31:53] basis points. This is during a bad time
[31:57] for transports. Go look at the transport
[31:59] index. Go look at what's happened in
[32:01] trade. The productivity gains that come
[32:03] and you get rewarded where your stock
[32:05] goes up 50% in a short amount of time,
[32:08] including at earnings. Most of that
[32:11] happened in two days. They had a 20%
[32:13] jump after Q2 earnings and uh details
[32:17] and the same thing in Q3. So, go look at
[32:19] those two and just go through it. In
[32:20] terms of you get all the negative
[32:22] reports, this one's from Wharton. new
[32:24] data on the corporate ROI from
[32:26] generative. So this is return on
[32:28] investment. They found that 75% already
[32:30] have a positive ROI from AI. Less than
[32:33] 5% negative return. So whatever stories
[32:36] you're trying to read, remember
[32:38] clickbait, clickbait, clickbait. If you
[32:40] didn't see that one, it's because didn't
[32:42] get any clicks. So I want to bring you
[32:44] back to something I wrote in May 15th.
[32:47] Um if you follow AI as much as I do, if
[32:49] you're watching all these podcasts or if
[32:51] you're going through it, you understand
[32:52] what tokens mean. You understand what
[32:54] inference means. You understand how much
[32:55] demand there is. I've heard, as I've
[32:58] said repeatedly, it shocked me when
[33:00] someone said, "I'm hearing from experts
[33:03] that DRAM prices for memory, memory
[33:07] related, will be overs supplied next
[33:09] year." This is something I heard less
[33:11] than six weeks ago.
[33:13] The experts don't seem to understand the
[33:16] demand side of the equation. This is not
[33:18] about the supply side. I can say it over
[33:20] and over again. This is something that
[33:22] has never happened before. We are
[33:24] literally putting intelligence in every
[33:27] machine and it will take forever, a
[33:30] decade. All we're doing right now is the
[33:32] data center buildout. We still have to
[33:34] put brains in every single machine,
[33:36] including dishwashers, washing machines,
[33:38] everything. Everything will have a
[33:40] brain. There is not enough
[33:42] semiconductors for that. So, if you guys
[33:44] don't have semis for some reason because
[33:47] it's not part of your silo. I wrote this
[33:50] back in May.
[33:52] These are the names that I put down. I
[33:54] am not a bottoms up person. These are
[33:56] the ones that I spent as I did my work
[33:58] to come up with which ones would have to
[34:00] include including ones on the edge
[34:02] embodied which are the next stage for
[34:04] robotic smart devices FSD. The ones that
[34:06] right now are going to start to go. So
[34:09] this was a combination of things. You go
[34:10] through these names on your own but I
[34:12] want you to see two things. Number one,
[34:15] it's up 40 plus percent. So this is an
[34:17] equal weight index of those names. The
[34:19] main thing I want you to show is look at
[34:21] the sharp ratio. There's no falls. These
[34:24] names are in different places. They're
[34:25] moving at different ways. You can build
[34:27] portfolios. This is the semi side pure.
[34:30] So see how it's more volatile. But this
[34:33] is it relative to the S&P up 16% versus
[34:37] 44. and software, which I'm going to
[34:40] keep saying, anyone who keeps trying to
[34:42] buy software, go read books about buying
[34:45] mall names from Amazon.
[34:50] All bubbles and David Rosenberg. For
[34:52] those of you who've been in the business
[34:53] long enough, this is not a shocking
[34:55] title except for the fact that it's less
[34:58] than a year ago that he wrote Lament of
[35:00] a Bear. I'm not going to say the stock
[35:02] market always gets a story right, but it
[35:03] is a broad and liquid market and
[35:04] collective positioning by thousands, if
[35:06] not hundreds of thousands of
[35:07] participants, and they're not stupid.
[35:09] So, it was an exercise in really trying
[35:11] to more deeply understand what the
[35:13] message is and maybe tipping my hat to
[35:14] the bulls instead of arguing and calling
[35:15] it a bubble every single day. My
[35:16] missives, but at the margin, what's
[35:19] changed for me? Well, maybe it's not a
[35:20] bubble. And yet, he's back to
[35:25] all bubbles in that I'm I'm only showing
[35:27] that not to pick on David Rosenberg.
[35:29] He's been a bear the entire time that
[35:30] I've read anything from him. This is
[35:32] really about the fact that if you're in
[35:34] that class and you're waiting for this
[35:35] thing to come down, the market has left
[35:37] you by. There will be a time where this
[35:39] stuff will go down. But if what you're
[35:41] reading is stuff like this,
[35:43] look at the scam. Everybody, they're
[35:45] just exchanging money. It's a
[35:48] concentrated market. It's a concentrated
[35:52] market. If everyone was buying oil right
[35:54] now, Exxon, Kico, and Chevron make up
[35:57] 50% of the energy index. I don't know
[36:01] how people get through this by just
[36:03] trying to turn something. It's not. The
[36:05] Mag 7 market cap is $22 trillion now.
[36:09] It's bigger than [laughter] it's bigger
[36:11] than a market cap of everything. I think
[36:13] Europe is right around 22 trillion in
[36:16] for the entire market cap. This is the
[36:18] mag seven.
[36:20] Gavin Baker gave an interview this week.
[36:22] Um, it was at a 16Z event. Um, and you
[36:26] know, he he simplifies it. Gavin Baker
[36:28] is someone I've referenced a bunch of
[36:29] times in here. At the peak of the dot
[36:30] bubble, 97% of the fiber that had been
[36:34] laid in America was dark, wasn't being
[36:37] used. Contrast that with today. There's
[36:40] not a single dark GPU. We have a
[36:43] shortage,
[36:44] severe memory shortage. Now remember the
[36:47] story I told you about someone who told
[36:49] me that experts in quotes multiple not
[36:51] one was that experts were saying there's
[36:55] going to be a supply issue. The memory
[36:58] shortage storm has entered a grim phase.
[37:00] The explosion of AI demand has triggered
[37:02] a widespread memory shortage and a rapid
[37:04] price surge across the entire industry.
[37:06] According to the supply chain, the
[37:07] shortage began to take a turning point
[37:09] in the third quarter and is now too late
[37:11] to secure supply.
[37:14] This is how quickly things change in
[37:16] this. Here is now the price of DRAM. I
[37:19] showed it when it was up at 12. It has
[37:21] just continued to move higher.
[37:26] Adam Jonas, so last week I spent a
[37:29] decent amount of time on Tesla. Uh I
[37:32] can't say this enough. This is the most
[37:33] important event in my opinion in the
[37:35] fact that once we have a situation where
[37:39] you have full self-driving by Tesla, not
[37:42] by Whimo, by Tesla because of the
[37:45] structural difference in the approach
[37:47] and how important it is to humanoids.
[37:49] It's a major major event and Adam Jonas
[37:53] called it this week. He said Tesla has
[37:57] solved autonomous driving. Remember, I
[38:00] highlighted this if you ha if you didn't
[38:02] watch it yet. This is a video. You can
[38:04] find it here on Twitter. You can also
[38:05] find it on YouTube. It's called The
[38:07] Robots Are Coming with Adam Jonas. I
[38:09] highly recommend listening to it. Here's
[38:12] what he said. I'm calling it autonomous
[38:14] cars are solved. He likened Tesla's
[38:16] current achievement to the invention of
[38:18] the steam engine, saying it is enough to
[38:20] pull the safety driver at scale in major
[38:23] markets.
[38:25] Jonas flagged three key showstoppers in
[38:27] the reports. With no safety drivers in
[38:30] Austin within a few months, they will
[38:32] operate with no safety drivers within a
[38:34] few months. He highlighted Jonas
[38:36] believes the remaining hesitation on the
[38:38] safety driver is internal caution. There
[38:42] is no explicit regulatory approval
[38:44] required to pull the driver. So, I said
[38:46] this before, Texas is going to allow
[38:48] this to happen. It won't happen in New
[38:50] York. It won't happen in a blue state
[38:51] for now. But the cost differential, if
[38:55] an Uber is costing me $60 to go from
[38:58] Manhattan to Brooklyn in a 20inut ride
[39:02] and an autonomous vehicle can do it for
[39:05] 70% less without a person in it. Once it
[39:08] comes here, it's over. Now, there's no
[39:12] way in the situation that people are
[39:15] where the middle class is having
[39:17] trouble, the 100,000 and under people
[39:19] are having trouble because of inflation,
[39:21] there's no way you can stop this from
[39:23] being happening inside a city. He
[39:25] reiterated Morgan Stanley's view that
[39:27] solving autonomy for cars unlocks the
[39:29] path for autonomy in other form factors
[39:31] of AI enabled robotics, aviation,
[39:34] marine, weapons, etc.
[39:38] the implications of Tesla's FSD business
[39:40] global penetration about 8 million
[39:42] vehicles. This is just again if you're
[39:44] short Tesla because of valuation um or
[39:48] because you don't like Elon Musk or
[39:50] whatever reason that you have uh if it's
[39:54] going to hurt you guys in terms of alpha
[39:56] to be short it I'd cover it if you're
[39:59] going to have it on there as part of the
[40:01] thing not being long it from a mutual
[40:02] fund perspective. Uh I think at this
[40:05] point you should spend some time on it.
[40:07] Uh because this is an important thing
[40:08] not just for this year but it's really
[40:10] important from an AI basis and if you
[40:12] haven't spent the time I'm happy to
[40:13] spend the time on it. Uh Tesla
[40:15] autonomous driving might do it faster
[40:17] than any tech. I completely agree and
[40:18] that's the biggest problem is that it
[40:20] will accelerate once it starts. The
[40:22] Tesla chair Robin Denholm was on TV and
[40:26] spoke about optimist. I'm not going to
[40:27] read the whole thing, but this is all
[40:29] setting us up to see what's going to
[40:31] happen at the shareholder meeting.
[40:33] Tesla's position at the forefront of
[40:34] major advancements in AI, robotics, and
[40:36] autonomous vehicles. It's entering the
[40:39] most transformative phase ever.
[40:44] Bitcoin down four and a half% for the
[40:46] month. Everyone's losing their mind
[40:49] inside the crypto space. We've got the
[40:52] crypto fear and greed index down around
[40:54] levels uh basically associated with
[40:58] points where you want to be buying. Um I
[41:00] mean literally every single time. It
[41:02] might take more time down here, but the
[41:04] sentiment is negative despite the fact
[41:07] that Bitcoin is still up 16 17% year to
[41:11] date. Uh more than the S&P 500, but
[41:14] people expect more. I wrote this and
[41:16] published it on Saturday morning. Uh, I
[41:21] would just go read it. Um, I think
[41:22] Bitcoin is really important for everyone
[41:24] to spend time. Last year and at the
[41:26] beginning of this year, I think there
[41:27] were a lot of people that didn't focus
[41:28] as much time on AI. If you're one of
[41:30] those people that played catch-up this
[41:32] year to really understand artificial
[41:33] intelligence, uh, you won't have as much
[41:36] time with crypto. Crypto will be
[41:38] dominating the markets next year in my
[41:40] opinion. The real bubble quote unquote
[41:42] will be in crypto. Uh, there is massive
[41:46] things going on, of which some of them
[41:47] I'll cover them. Uh, Bitcoin will always
[41:49] be a major benefactor, but we are still
[41:51] coming out of the.com bubble for crypto.
[41:54] The VCs are packed with investments they
[41:57] made in 21 in crypto. Those are locked
[42:00] into investments that were also made in
[42:01] SAS. Now you have AI. Crypto just does
[42:04] not have the money flows coming in. And
[42:06] you have this overhang that's been
[42:07] there. Bitcoin's been able to go higher
[42:09] because of institutional adoptions. The
[42:11] altcoins are still down 25 to 30%.
[42:14] You're at the beginning stages of the
[42:16] next phase in crypto and people need to
[42:18] pay attention. 17 years after the white
[42:20] paper, the Bitcoin network is still
[42:22] operational. Bessim put this out on the
[42:24] birthday of the white paper. Here's the
[42:26] big news. Zel um
[42:31] Zel is going to expand internationally
[42:34] using stable coins.
[42:36] This is a monumental development, but
[42:38] it's being quietly presented almost too
[42:41] quietly. This is what happens now with
[42:43] everything related to crypto and AI is
[42:45] these things happen and you just don't
[42:48] realize how important they are. Zel is
[42:50] just not another fintech app. It is the
[42:52] clearing interface for over 1,800 US
[42:55] banks including the big ones. It's
[42:57] responsible for over 80% of all
[43:00] deposits, collectively managing
[43:01] trillions in retail flow. When the
[43:04] network integrates stable coins for
[43:06] international transfers, what's really
[43:07] happening is the digitization of the US
[43:09] dollar settlement layer. the plumbing
[43:10] beneath the financial systems. So if you
[43:13] thought about the banking system having
[43:15] to go one at a time to go through this,
[43:18] this is the reverse Trojan horse of
[43:22] monetary control, a private sector roll
[43:24] out masking as convenience. This is
[43:27] because again just like I said with the
[43:29] Tesla thing, governments would be
[43:32] forced. Well, the banking system, the
[43:34] monopoly, trying to keep control, trying
[43:37] to keep their vig is basically saying we
[43:40] have to do something to keep compete
[43:42] with Visa, to compete with Mastercard,
[43:44] to compete with Stripe, to compete with
[43:45] Circle, to compete with Tether, to
[43:47] compete with everyone. Walmart's doing
[43:48] it, Amazon's doing it. Doesn't really
[43:50] matter. um stable coins become the
[43:53] invisible infrastructure. the adoption
[43:55] phase from 2526 estimated total stable
[43:59] coin transaction volume right now I
[44:00] think it's about 6 to 10 trillion so it
[44:02] would double next year but then you look
[44:05] this is the the point in exponential
[44:08] you get more than a doubling more than a
[44:11] doubling in the next few years so again
[44:14] I would just realize that what's going
[44:16] to happen here is the growth is going to
[44:20] accelerate we had hundreds of banks
[44:22] instantly stable coins will replace
[44:25] Swift for highfrequency settlement. Most
[44:29] importantly, the integration into
[44:30] wallets. Basically, I thought it would
[44:32] take a long time for people to get
[44:34] wallets. Now, it's just going to be
[44:35] easier. US banks enter the stable coin
[44:37] arena, disruption of 1 trillion in
[44:39] remittance market. So, this is for
[44:40] overseas.
[44:42] Um, I'm not going to talk about it now,
[44:44] but the Argentina situation, if Malay
[44:46] had lost last week, I think there would
[44:48] have been a run on Argentina, very
[44:50] similar to Silicon Valley Bank. That's
[44:52] for another day. But I do think this
[44:54] brings again this high-speed activity
[44:56] just like it is for the retail structure
[44:58] of the stock market. Faster faster
[45:01] things, exponential innovation,
[45:02] exponential change, exponential
[45:04] disruption leads to exponential periods
[45:07] of volatility uh including runs on
[45:09] sovereigns. Uh
[45:12] this is all and again by turning zel
[45:14] into a regulated global stable coin
[45:16] network, the US quietly reasserts dollar
[45:18] dominance. They're trying to speed up
[45:20] the ability, which is why the
[45:22] regulations are so loose. Loose
[45:24] regulations like they are now as opposed
[45:26] to incredibly tight will definitely have
[45:30] some problems that pick up along the
[45:31] way, but for the time being, the
[45:33] adoption is going on. It has huge
[45:35] implications for Bitcoin. I want to make
[45:37] sure you connect volumes inside the
[45:39] digital wallet. Allowing more wallets to
[45:41] grow means more money that's already
[45:43] there, which means on your phone, you
[45:45] can immediately transfer your stable
[45:46] coins into Bitcoin. Bitcoin will
[45:48] continue to be a growth factor. I
[45:50] listened to this podcast for the first
[45:52] time this week. Bell curve loved it.
[45:54] This was a great episode. The token
[45:56] revolution again for you. Those of you
[45:58] are trying to catch up on how to deal on
[46:00] the crypto side. You've got Circle
[46:02] obviously is an IPO this year.
[46:04] Tokenization is going to be a big story
[46:06] next year and stable coins are going to
[46:07] help drive it. This particular episode
[46:10] they go through a lot of different
[46:11] things. They talk about some of the
[46:13] things that I talked about in terms of
[46:17] the participation that's going on now is
[46:20] just much different. Back then
[46:23] you had
[46:25] really money being thrown all over the
[46:27] place from every direction. It was much
[46:30] more of a bubble phase in 21-22. There
[46:33] was money everywhere. Everything's now
[46:35] going in a different way. But you got
[46:37] the regulatory green light open the door
[46:39] for regular regulated financial
[46:41] institutions to use blockchain rails. So
[46:42] the blockchain rails are growing.
[46:44] They're using all of this
[46:48] pathway for tokenized assets which is
[46:50] super important because the volumes just
[46:52] explode because everything becomes token
[46:54] tokenized.
[46:55] The announcement crystallized a broader
[46:57] trend. Tokenization and stable coins are
[46:59] no longer speculative. They're becoming
[47:00] pay payment plumbing.
[47:03] It represents the fusion of trady and
[47:05] blockchain. So again, left lane, right
[47:07] lane. Left lane is crypto. Right lane is
[47:11] the old banking swift system. You want
[47:13] to be making money by investing on the
[47:15] things that are going to benefit
[47:16] dramatically from the speed. The most
[47:19] interesting part of this uh for me uh in
[47:23] terms of this phase was comparing this
[47:25] to the web 2, web 3 analogy. This was
[47:28] for a minute in here. uh they brought up
[47:30] this Rivet Capital report uh that
[47:33] reminded the host of web two. After
[47:36] the.com bubble burst, the market went
[47:37] through a phase of disillusionment.
[47:39] Valuations crashed, investors retreated,
[47:41] but key infrastructure had already been
[47:42] built. So go back to the dark fiber
[47:44] thing that I mentioned from Gavin Baker.
[47:46] The dark fiber that was there eventually
[47:49] all filled up. This is what's happened.
[47:51] The blockchain, the rails, everything
[47:53] has been built. So now we can have the
[47:56] next generation of applications just
[47:58] like what went on with the telecom
[47:59] companies. So the the buildout that we
[48:02] had in 21 and 22, right now there's not
[48:05] as much money going in the space. It's
[48:06] gradually going in. Like I said, a lot
[48:08] of it's trapped in the VC world. You've
[48:11] got hedge funds that invested a lot.
[48:13] They're not getting in. The altcoins
[48:15] haven't done well. So you don't have the
[48:16] momentum side, but you have a lot of
[48:18] smart entrepreneurs that are getting in.
[48:22] Why this matters? the infrastructure
[48:24] maturity. So again, the level twos, you
[48:26] can go through this with already the
[48:27] cost deflation. There's a reason to do
[48:30] this. And again, when you have inflation
[48:31] problems for the 100,000 and below, the
[48:35] banks are a major friction. They're a
[48:37] major cost. They are major problem. Same
[48:39] thing as the credit cards. There's a lot
[48:41] of money that increases the cost of
[48:43] goods because of the cost that it costs
[48:45] a business to do this and individuals.
[48:48] All of the arbitrage, all of the fees,
[48:50] everything will all go down
[48:52] dramatically. the entrepreneurs energy
[48:54] is returning. Shift from speculation to
[48:57] utility which is the most powerful point
[48:59] of anything. Now in terms of the tokens
[49:02] this Rivet Capital report on token
[49:05] revolution tokens are the heart of a new
[49:07] era acting as the building blocks of AI
[49:09] money identity and digital assets at
[49:11] their core there these systems all run
[49:13] on tokens. This is the connection
[49:15] between AI and crypto. And again,
[49:18] whether it's tokens itself for
[49:21] tokenization or AI tokens, this
[49:26] report links them all, but it also
[49:28] breaks it down into the value loop, the
[49:30] expertise loop, the personalization
[49:32] loop. Think of it as your identity, your
[49:35] money, your um your health care, every
[49:39] identity that you have. So tokens unify
[49:41] AI and crypto.
[49:43] Why now? Frictions finally dropped.
[49:46] These are all the things that I
[49:47] mentioned in terms of why this is is
[49:49] happening now. You should go read the
[49:51] report. It connects them all. And most
[49:53] importantly,
[49:55] Dan Ies, who most people have heard, he
[49:58] got connected to Sam Alman's
[50:00] cryptocurrency. So, this is the identity
[50:03] token. This is the individual thing of
[50:06] who you are. So, this is the his orbs
[50:09] thing in terms of going through it. So
[50:12] how worldcoin aligns with the token
[50:14] revolution framework identity and proof
[50:16] of personhood tokenization of human
[50:18] presence intersection of AI and crypto
[50:21] global ambition and interference of
[50:22] scale. So again worldcoin aims to scale
[50:24] its orbs and verification network
[50:26] globally.
[50:29] The Salana founder was on moonshots this
[50:31] week. This is the third episode of
[50:33] crypto. If you've at least listened to
[50:35] me on moonshots but you haven't listened
[50:37] to the prior crypto ones. They did one
[50:39] over the summer. They did one a couple
[50:41] weeks ago. Here's another one. I would
[50:42] go listen to all three. There is alpha
[50:45] to be made in crypto next year. And now
[50:48] that you at least have ETFs, everyone
[50:50] can participate. There's more things
[50:51] that are coming. Immad Musto made
[50:53] several points in that Raul Powell
[50:55] thing. Crypto as the next bubble and why
[50:58] it's inevitable.
[51:00] I'm not going to read all of these in
[51:02] here, but I really do believe that you
[51:05] need to understand how important it is
[51:06] for the financial guard rails to finally
[51:09] change. Literally putting lubricant on
[51:12] them so everything can move faster, more
[51:15] efficiently, cheaper, overnight, the
[51:18] transactions will explode. And we need
[51:21] that. In fact, his point was he argues
[51:24] that AI drives a massive deflationary
[51:26] shock, collapsing the cost of cognitive
[51:28] labor. Governments will need a way to
[51:30] increase money velocity. This is what
[51:32] we've been lacking. You've all heard
[51:34] that M2 velocity has gone down forever.
[51:36] The money goes into money markets and it
[51:38] just sits there. The money goes into
[51:40] something and it doesn't move. AI agents
[51:42] will be transacting tokenized assets.
[51:45] The ability of moving stuff around,
[51:47] getting liquidity from your assets that
[51:50] are not liquid. All of these things will
[51:52] happen whether it's your house or
[51:53] everything. France stuns Europe. Could
[51:56] lawmakers adopt Bitcoin and ban the
[51:57] digital euro? I only bring that up
[52:00] because of Michael Sailor.
[52:03] For whatever you think of Michael
[52:04] Sailor, I want to remind you where we
[52:07] are. We've got the halves and the have
[52:09] nots. If you're not Apple, Google,
[52:10] video, you need to find a strategy to
[52:12] break free from the strangleold of
[52:13] digital monopolies. There's 12,000
[52:15] public companies in the US. Most of them
[52:17] have lost in most Most of them the
[52:20] market has lost interest in and they're
[52:21] competing against a Google, Amazon, or
[52:23] Apple. So this gets back into the $22
[52:25] trillion for the size of the MAG7 while
[52:28] the Russell 2000's market cap is 3
[52:30] trillion. 22 trillion verse3 trillion.
[52:32] The Russell 2000 was a bigger market cap
[52:34] in 2013 than the sum of those. This has
[52:36] all happened over the last decade.
[52:38] Michael Sailor decided to do what he did
[52:40] with strategy. Regardless of what people
[52:42] think and the same reason that other
[52:44] companies are doing it, they're not
[52:46] doing it from a place of strength.
[52:47] They're doing it from a place of
[52:49] weakness. These companies are zombies.
[52:52] And this is the approach he made. His
[52:54] company was a zombie. Micro Strategy was
[52:56] a zombie. When you're one of those small
[52:59] midsize companies and you're staring at
[53:01] these trillion dollar digital giants and
[53:02] no one cares about you, you start
[53:04] thinking it's kind of hopeless. I think
[53:06] 96% of public companies now qualify as
[53:09] zombie companies unable to perform
[53:10] outperform a Treasury bill.
[53:14] So every time that you hear equal weight
[53:15] S&P verse S&P and it looks like this,
[53:19] Michael Sailor decided to do this here.
[53:21] He decided at that point to put Bitcoin
[53:25] in because he had no other solution to
[53:26] his business. So that becomes a quote
[53:28] unquote bubble by the bears. Micro
[53:31] Strategy must be a bubble. Everything
[53:33] he's done with the business in terms of
[53:34] the way he's done this has been not only
[53:37] smart, it's way above anything that
[53:38] public companies do in terms of terming
[53:40] out the debt. What he's done with the
[53:41] converts, what he's doing with the
[53:43] premium, everything in here, you look at
[53:45] what's happened. You get shown this
[53:47] chart. This is a concentrated market. So
[53:49] the S&P 500 is outperforming the equal
[53:52] weight cap weights. It's just getting
[53:54] worse. This is literally what he just
[53:56] described in there. So he made the
[53:58] decision to do something differently.
[54:00] Here's what Bitcoin has done relative to
[54:02] the S&P. So, I just showed you equal
[54:05] weight to S&P and it was a straight
[54:07] waterfall cliff. Here's what Bitcoin has
[54:09] done relative to the S&P since Michael
[54:11] Sailor decided to do that. Well, that
[54:13] was a pretty damn good trade. So, here's
[54:16] the Micro Strategy stock. Oh, wow. Here
[54:18] it is. Bitcoin over the S&P. He
[54:21] basically just decided I can't compete
[54:23] with the MAG7. They're just going to
[54:25] continue to win. So, what I'm going to
[54:27] do as a zombie company that has no
[54:29] chance to win is I'm going to take the
[54:30] billion dollars I have and I'm going to
[54:32] go put it into something that actually
[54:34] is the opposite of what these guys are
[54:36] doing in the future of what I believe
[54:38] will happen.
[54:40] So, here we have Bitcoin relative to the
[54:42] Mag 7. And again, it's unchanged since
[54:44] the end of 2020. It's even outperformed
[54:46] the Mag 7 since he got into it. So, I
[54:50] only bring this up as I finish this week
[54:52] out. You've had the chance this year to
[54:55] spend time on AI and yet many many
[54:57] people are still worried that it's a
[54:58] bubble. I'm telling you this will only
[55:01] continue and there will be pockets of
[55:03] blowups along the way where the market
[55:05] will fall 20 to 30%. Your job is not to
[55:07] time the market. It's to figure out the
[55:09] places with inside the market that the
[55:11] majority of people have not discounted.
[55:13] Nobody spends enough time on artificial
[55:15] intelligence has done the work. It's not
[55:16] a technology. It is electricity. There
[55:19] are many many places. Reach out to me.
[55:21] reach out to 22V get you'll you'll get
[55:24] information that'll help. We're entering
[55:26] the worst part for labor. This is the
[55:28] dystopian phase. This is when I expect
[55:30] crypto to not only accelerate to the
[55:32] upside, but to be necessary. This is
[55:35] coming out of the dotcom bubble. This is
[55:36] where you want to focus your attention.
[55:38] If you want to stick with the mag 7 at
[55:40] this point, be my guest and enjoy it.
[55:42] But if you're overweight to those, if
[55:43] you're overweight, Oracle, if you're
[55:45] overweight, GEV, if you're overweight,
[55:47] all of these tech, these AI names that
[55:48] have worked, I think this is going to be
[55:50] more about the retail structure
[55:52] changing. It's going to be a small cap,
[55:54] a gambling environment. It's going to be
[55:56] very, very difficult for people that
[55:57] wait. You do not have time on your side.
