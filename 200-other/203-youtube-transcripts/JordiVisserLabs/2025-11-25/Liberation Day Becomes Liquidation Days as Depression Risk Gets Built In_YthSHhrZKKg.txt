--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] historic week. Uh let's go through it.
[00:03] Libertate Liberation Day tended to uh
[00:06] lead to liquidation days. Um I'll go
[00:09] through why the market responded this
[00:11] way. All the panic
[00:13] indicators pretty much have checked off
[00:15] now. Um so we've had enough selling at
[00:18] this point that on all levels, including
[00:20] recession levels, we're at important um
[00:23] points in history. Uh it was a bad time
[00:25] for a good payroll number. Will Trump
[00:28] reverse course or is this uh our future?
[00:32] And uh the winner for last week clearly
[00:35] was Bitcoin and I'll go through that to
[00:37] finish up. So let's just start it off
[00:40] since he made the announcement and there
[00:42] was a lot of confusion on both how he
[00:45] came up with the numbers and uh what
[00:48] they were. I think this is the major
[00:50] story as to what triggered the selloff.
[00:52] It was really a combination of of three
[00:55] things. One is uh it was larger than
[00:57] what was expected. This is Goldman
[00:59] Sachs. They had expected
[01:02] uh 15 B 15 uh percentage uh percentages
[01:07] 15% it came in on theirs calculation
[01:11] 18.7 other people have different ones.
[01:14] Uh the second thing is it didn't make
[01:16] any sense. So, uh, when people went
[01:19] through it and how they calculated it,
[01:22] uh, immediately afterwards, people
[01:25] figured out and decoded what the numbers
[01:27] were and just realized there was no real
[01:30] formula and this was just put out there.
[01:32] And then the third thing, uh, that
[01:34] people are worried about at this point
[01:35] still is how long are these going to be
[01:37] on. So, let's go through a little bit of
[01:39] history.
[01:41] So uh I wanted to make sure that since
[01:43] uh people were texting about well this
[01:46] is inflationary uh this is deflationary
[01:49] the way it stands now and the reason is
[01:52] you just have to go back to smooth holly
[01:54] uh and realize that this was
[01:57] done basically in 1930 after we had the
[02:01] uh crash of the market we had bounced
[02:05] and then we put tariffs around the globe
[02:07] the trading partners retaliated as we've
[02:10] seen so far with China and we'll see if
[02:12] we get other countries to follow uh
[02:14] back. They've left some time for
[02:16] negotiation. China came back
[02:18] immediately. But I want you to read the
[02:19] last line here of Smooll. It was
[02:21] followed by more liberal trade
[02:23] agreements such as the Reciprocal Trade
[02:25] Agreements Act of 1934. So let let's
[02:29] just see what happened between 1930. So
[02:32] here is when Smood Holly came into
[02:34] effect. We had already had basically the
[02:37] crash. We had rallied into the Great
[02:40] Depression and started to go back up
[02:41] towards the highs. We were actually
[02:44] actually before, you know, where we were
[02:46] before the final runup. We get had
[02:48] bounced back. You had this and then the
[02:50] market proceeded to go into the Great
[02:52] Depression and everything that you've
[02:53] read about until
[02:55] 1934. Basically, that's
[02:57] when the reciprocal tariff act. So, it
[03:01] was widely credited with ushering an era
[03:03] of liberal trade policy that persisted
[03:05] throughout the 20th century. I bring
[03:07] this up because at the end of the day,
[03:09] uh, everyone is spending their time like
[03:12] extrapolating what has been done
[03:14] already. We don't know if this is all
[03:16] negotiation. Uh, we don't know how much
[03:19] of this is real. Almost everybody
[03:21] expected there to be tariffs. The reason
[03:23] the market has sold off so much is
[03:25] because the uncertainty that people had
[03:28] with what he was trying to accomplish
[03:30] has actually worsened. I think we're at
[03:32] peak. We had peaked already in terms of
[03:34] uncertainty. Now we know the worst of
[03:36] the numbers based on what Besson has
[03:38] said. Uh and since China came back and
[03:40] we didn't get increase, I think we can
[03:42] still go with that for the time be time
[03:44] being particularly when I show you some
[03:46] of the other things. uh but we have to
[03:48] stick with the fact that at this point
[03:50] the market is responding to an
[03:52] extrapolation that what happened on
[03:54] Wednesday is going to be here for a long
[03:56] time and we don't know that and that's
[03:58] why the market could change quickly and
[03:59] I'm going to go through where we are in
[04:01] terms of recession because at the end of
[04:03] the day uh it's really about recession
[04:05] and earnings and what he did on
[04:06] Wednesday if it sticks plus what China
[04:10] has done and what the other countries
[04:11] are like to do uh you are talking about
[04:14] something which is not reciprocal trade
[04:17] you're talking about something which is
[04:18] meant to not only take the tariffs into
[04:22] play that other countries have but the
[04:24] non-tariff barriers and that's where the
[04:26] issue comes in uh for all of this. So I
[04:28] just want to bring up Steven Mirren
[04:29] who's really the architect his paper a
[04:32] users guide to restructuring the global
[04:33] trading system which came out in
[04:34] November. Uh he is the chair of the
[04:37] council of economic adviserss. They're
[04:39] the ones that basically put everything
[04:40] out. Uh so what he wrote and this is uh
[04:44] from Grock. I asked Rock to go in and
[04:46] give me a summary of his paper uh
[04:49] including uh all the pieces in terms of
[04:52] the way it should be implemented and
[04:55] here's what he put in there. So tariffs
[04:57] as a multi-purpose tool. Great. He
[04:59] explicitly cautions that a sudden shock
[05:01] to tariff rates of the size proposed can
[05:04] result in financial market volatility
[05:06] due to significant exchange rate
[05:07] fluctuations and uncertainty. That's
[05:10] exactly what we've had. To counter this,
[05:12] Mirren advocates for a gradual and
[05:14] predictable approach. That's not what we
[05:16] have. Suggesting the administration
[05:18] provide forward guidance on tariff
[05:20] increase similar to how central banks
[05:21] you uh this would give markets time to
[05:24] adjust and reduce the risk of abrupt
[05:26] sell-offs. That is why we had the
[05:28] selloff. He not only came out with it,
[05:30] it left more uncertainty. There was no
[05:32] warning uh in terms of the the numbers
[05:35] because there's no anyone could come up
[05:37] with that. But at the end, the numbers
[05:39] are higher than what was expected. I
[05:41] think if he had come out and said this
[05:42] is what we're going to do a flat 20% tax
[05:44] I don't think the reaction necessarily
[05:45] would have been as bad because at least
[05:47] there would have been some logic and
[05:49] some belief there would be negotiations
[05:51] but in this case it almost seemed like
[05:53] it was meant to get the reaction that he
[05:55] got both in the market and from the
[05:57] trading partners in terms of the S&P uh
[05:59] this is the two-day return 10 and a
[06:02] half% uh you can go back and look over
[06:05] time uh in terms of a two-day move this
[06:08] goes all the way back to 1950 50 uh it
[06:11] was the fourth largest uh in the last 75
[06:15] years. So we had a significant response.
[06:18] The other ones are COVID uh and uh the
[06:21] great financial crisis. So when you put
[06:23] things into context as to what has
[06:26] happened, this is a historic event. Uh
[06:28] another way to look at it, this is the
[06:30] weekly move. So it was down 9% for the
[06:32] week. And again, you go back and look,
[06:35] uh, you've got after 911, you've got the
[06:38] great financial crisis, you've got
[06:40] COVID, and now you've got something
[06:42] which will live forever in terms of, oh,
[06:44] we'll go back and look and go, oh, that
[06:45] was liberation day. Uh, so we repriced
[06:48] everything immediately. On that day
[06:51] after, we dis we took growth down
[06:53] significantly. I've shown this before.
[06:55] This is the equal weight consumer
[06:56] discretionary relative to equal weight
[06:58] consumer staples. Uh, this kind of break
[07:01] lower Again, only happens during times
[07:04] where the economy suddenly goes in
[07:07] towards a recession. Uh I've used this a
[07:09] bunch of times for a variety of reasons,
[07:11] but this is also the three-month
[07:13] earnings provision uh earnings per share
[07:15] revision factor. Uh it had had this
[07:17] first leg lower, did kind of the webinar
[07:20] on what had happened to hedge funds went
[07:21] up and then this was the these were the
[07:24] two biggest days yet of all this. So, uh
[07:27] damage done to the hedge fund community
[07:29] uh for sure over the last two days. uh
[07:31] and this time unlike when we got the
[07:34] first wave. So remember the first wave
[07:35] of that earnings revision happened in
[07:37] here this is the European banks you know
[07:40] this is the place believe it or not
[07:42] people were hiding uh in a group uh that
[07:45] has been a death trap for people and
[07:47] it's proven to be a death trap again as
[07:48] it gave up 75% of the gains in basically
[07:53] 7 days but in two days it gave up about
[07:55] 60%. So this is just another thing. Any
[07:58] momentum trades that were sitting up
[07:59] here, they unwound quickly. It was
[08:01] across the globe. It wasn't just in the
[08:03] US. Uh but believe it or not, in terms
[08:05] of the S&P, we are still not from a draw
[08:08] down basis at a number that is
[08:10] inconsistent with history. Uh this goes
[08:13] back 55 years. Uh we're down 17%.
[08:16] There's been plenty of times we've been
[08:17] down more, including uh times where we
[08:20] didn't have a recession, uh back here,
[08:23] 22. So, we still have a chance uh in
[08:26] this of another I would say 10%
[08:29] uh easily before we'd have a point where
[08:33] we'd we'd be at a historical level. And
[08:35] the same thing goes for the MAG 7 with
[08:37] regards to 2022. This is going to become
[08:39] more important because I'll bring this
[08:40] up with Bitcoin, but the MAG 7 is really
[08:43] one of the important things. It was
[08:44] thrown under the bus by Scott Besson
[08:46] blaming the stock market on this. Uh
[08:48] it's now down 30% from the highs. Uh
[08:51] again we had a 50% fall uh in that group
[08:54] there. We had a 35% fall during COVID.
[08:57] Uh but we are now at the third largest
[08:59] since this group got to the size that it
[09:01] did. It was a panic day. Um this is just
[09:04] a list because I don't want to make this
[09:06] thing over 50 minutes. It's probably
[09:08] going to be 50 minutes today. Highest
[09:10] selling in 15 years. Two day largest
[09:12] two-day drop in 50 years. Uh VIX at 45.
[09:16] Where returns on average one week later
[09:18] plus four blah blah blah blah blah. You
[09:19] can go through all of this and read them
[09:20] on your own. Uh but let's just say no
[09:23] matter which way you go, this was a
[09:25] historic day and there are two days and
[09:27] there was capitulation everywhere. The
[09:30] VIX uh for the week was up
[09:33] 109%. Uh so it doubled. Uh again that
[09:37] highlights not just the movement but how
[09:40] surprising it was. Meaning it was coming
[09:42] beforehand at a time where there wasn't
[09:45] much expectations. You never had a week
[09:47] like this during ' 08 during the great
[09:49] financial crisis because the Vault was
[09:50] moving higher the entire year. It was
[09:51] already at high levels and then it just
[09:53] sat at high levels. This was coming at a
[09:55] point where people you know didn't
[09:58] believe it was going anywhere. But more
[09:59] importantly, it's because we had very
[10:01] very low correlation in the market. I
[10:03] had highlighted that breath was fine.
[10:06] This had been a rotation until
[10:08] Wednesday. Once Wednesday happened uh
[10:10] after the close Thursday and Friday
[10:13] everything shifted. you had one
[10:14] correlation moves. You had over 92% of
[10:17] the stocks down on Friday in the S&P
[10:20] 500. So, it was a complete bloodbath uh
[10:22] in terms of uh the selling. We also had
[10:25] credit blowout significantly. Uh for the
[10:28] week, it uh high yield uh option
[10:31] adjusted
[10:32] spreads. They were at 84 basis points.
[10:34] So, this is uh basically the highest in
[10:37] the last or the 13 years we have of data
[10:39] except for when the market shut down
[10:42] during COVID. uh junk bonds suffer worst
[10:44] route since COVID. So not just US but
[10:47] the globe commodities price gauge caps
[10:50] biggest two-day drop since 2011. This
[10:51] why I said this is deflationary. This is
[10:53] depression type stuff in terms of the
[10:56] movements. The market is responding to
[10:57] Smoot Holly and to trade wars to
[10:59] unwinding positions. It's a quick change
[11:02] from this will be the most pro business
[11:05] government uh ever to uh the most anti-b
[11:09] businessiness government in terms of
[11:11] creating a panic uh in such a short
[11:14] amount of time. The bare index actually
[11:16] get up to the third uh highest level
[11:18] this week on record. uh both of these
[11:22] both in 90 at the end of the recession
[11:24] and also March 9th uh or March 6 of09
[11:28] these were believe it or not the
[11:29] absolute lows in the markets uh those
[11:32] bare markets. So we'll see what happens
[11:35] um if if this week was uh enough to turn
[11:37] it. Uh the high versus low beta
[11:40] performance is now in the zero
[11:41] percentile uh percentile going back uh
[11:45] to 2010. This is uh Jeff Degraphth
[11:49] work. And then you've got the Russell
[11:51] 3000. We finally now have uh reached a
[11:54] level where the market is, you know, has
[11:57] built in a recession. It's blown things
[11:59] out or at least a high probability of a
[12:01] recession. We only have 15 16% of the
[12:03] Russell 3000 above the 200 day moving
[12:06] average now. So, we've definitely got
[12:08] everything done. And the one thing that
[12:09] has been a disappointment, I'm sure, for
[12:11] the administration, uh, for the week, I
[12:14] mean, I hear a lot of people talking
[12:15] that 10, they're getting what they want
[12:16] with 10ear yields down with the S&P
[12:18] falling this much. 10 year olds were
[12:20] down 25 basis points for the week. This
[12:22] this was not even uh, you know, a week
[12:24] to to remember in terms of how big the
[12:27] moves are. But in particular, if we go
[12:28] back to uh, the stuff like in you know,
[12:31] the great financial crisis, we were
[12:33] getting 60 and 50 basis point uh, moves
[12:36] during that. If you go to COVID, it was
[12:37] 40. We got 25 basis points during a
[12:40] panic. So tenure rates are still not
[12:42] coming down. And a lot of that is the
[12:43] the fears over how much people are going
[12:46] to have to raise prices at the company
[12:48] level to be able to stay in business,
[12:49] which will be part of the story that we
[12:50] end up hearing. It's going to be one or
[12:52] the other. They either put the prices
[12:53] through or we lose a tremendous amount
[12:55] of businesses and we lose jobs. Um those
[12:57] are the only two alternatives. They
[12:59] can't handle these losses uh in terms of
[13:01] not passing them through regardless of
[13:03] what the administration wants. from a
[13:04] technical basis. Uh if you were going to
[13:06] pick a level to where I still think we
[13:10] can get to um if we do get there, I
[13:12] think it's going to be a flush type
[13:14] move, meaning it happens in a very short
[13:15] amount of time. Uh meaning there's
[13:17] another fall that's coming. That's
[13:19] probably, you know, 5 to 10% if not two.
[13:22] This would take us down to two levels.
[13:24] Um one is the highs uh from 2021 or end
[13:28] of 2021 into 22 before we started that
[13:30] bare market. We held the 200week moving
[13:33] average. This has historically and I'm
[13:35] not just doing in here. It has
[13:36] historically been the place that unless
[13:39] you have significant job losses and it
[13:42] lasts for a period of time. So these
[13:44] were big job losses, big job losses. We
[13:46] had job losses in 20 job loss in 20 but
[13:48] everything snapped back because of the
[13:50] printing that came on to stay below the
[13:52] 200E moving average. This needs to be a
[13:54] sustained bare market where it takes
[13:57] multiple years to get back to the highs.
[14:00] That could be what we're in store for,
[14:02] but the only way we're going to be in
[14:03] store for that is if the job situation
[14:05] starts to unravel, which has not
[14:06] happened yet. Uh, year-over-year S&P,
[14:08] the green line there is my, you know,
[14:11] history of kind of using this to figure
[14:13] out when the percent probability of a
[14:14] risk of the S of a recession in the US
[14:16] is 50%. Uh, so the S&P has got us to
[14:20] where we're above 50%, somewhere around
[14:22] 55. The red line there uh for me is when
[14:25] you're pretty much in any anything over
[14:28] the 17% level in terms of down
[14:31] year-over-year, it's really hard to not
[14:33] have a recession. We've obviously had
[14:34] some periods where that didn't happen.
[14:36] 2022 is one if you want to be safe.
[14:38] Below 20, you're pretty much in there.
[14:41] Uh we also got down to around 20 with
[14:44] the uh the crash of 87 without having a
[14:47] recession. But for the most part, the
[14:49] S&P 500 is the best gauge uh along with
[14:52] jobless claims, like I've said, for
[14:54] recession risk. To show how quickly this
[14:56] has gone, JP Morgan just three weeks ago
[14:59] uh said US stocks overplay recession
[15:01] risk. Then on uh on uh Friday at 3 in
[15:08] the morning, JP Morgan raises recession
[15:10] risk to 60%.
[15:13] Then at 5:00 pm on the same day, JP
[15:16] Morgan says Trump's tariffs to send us
[15:18] into recession. So now they're
[15:20] forecasting an a real growth of
[15:24] minus.3%. That's important to this
[15:26] because
[15:28] minus.3% uh in my argument uh in my my
[15:31] impression unless we have job losses
[15:33] that is going to be something where we
[15:34] should hold the 200E moving average
[15:36] which means there's 10% more downside.
[15:39] Uh, and my guess is this could have been
[15:41] the low for the week if that's the case.
[15:43] Uh, and I'll explain why, but I think
[15:45] you're going to get a quick movement to
[15:47] the 200 week uh, based on not having any
[15:51] turnaround from Trump and willing to
[15:52] play this out. Uh, but at that point, I
[15:55] think we will have discounted enough to
[15:57] where we're fair value or actually cheap
[16:01] relative to the likelihood of a
[16:02] recession uh, down at around 4700. Uh
[16:06] Ted Cruz warns tariff rifts are risk
[16:08] sparking GOP wipeout in 2026 elections.
[16:12] Uh so you're starting to get and this
[16:14] was before Friday. Uh you're starting to
[16:16] get more and more the Republicans on
[16:17] there. I thought this was worth showing
[16:19] to you guys. Um I respect Gavin Baker a
[16:23] lot as a thinker and also as someone who
[16:27] was absolutely in favor of tariffs. Uh
[16:31] and kind of laid out the day before. I'm
[16:33] not going to show that tweet, but he
[16:34] laid out the day before what how he
[16:37] thought this would be handled. And this
[16:39] was the opposite of where it was. Um
[16:41] meaning coming out this way, not having
[16:43] it gradual, and we still may get to what
[16:45] he thought was best for the country, but
[16:47] the reality is uh he said, I say all of
[16:51] this as someone who's open-minded to
[16:52] tariffs that were thoughtfully
[16:53] constructed, gradually phased in, and
[16:55] accompanied by massive deregulation.
[16:57] ideal outcome would have been some
[16:59] combination of reshoring revenue
[17:00] generation and seeing our largest
[17:02] trading partners lower their barriers to
[17:03] American goods. It is a fact that until
[17:06] yesterday, we generally had much lower
[17:07] tariff rates than other countries. I'm
[17:09] going to leave the Besson stuff out, but
[17:11] I think the point was there's someone
[17:14] who thought we were going to get
[17:15] something was speaking about it on
[17:16] podcast, tweeting about it. Uh tariffs
[17:18] are fine. I think everyone had come to
[17:21] the world had come to an agreement that
[17:23] something needs to be done. I even think
[17:25] the other countries believe that. I just
[17:27] think the way this was handled and the
[17:29] communication uh seems to be either
[17:31] meant for negotiating from a position of
[17:35] uh fear-mongering and willing to show
[17:38] that they're putting the country in pain
[17:40] or this is just the reality and this is
[17:42] what he wants to do is just cleanse the
[17:44] system and if he does you've got people
[17:46] out there like Gavin Baker and also Brad
[17:48] Gersonner who also has been supportive
[17:50] of tariffs uh highlighting VIX spiking
[17:53] highest fear level since co now things
[17:55] start to break the danger With shock
[17:57] therapy approaches and complex systems,
[17:59] it's impossible to model the negative
[18:01] reflexity. This is something I say all
[18:04] the time when it comes to people messing
[18:06] and not understanding how interconnected
[18:08] the world is. They did this with Lehman
[18:11] Brothers and it led to a version of a
[18:13] depression. We would have had a
[18:14] depression if it wasn't for the fact
[18:16] that we printed an enormous amount of
[18:17] money. How can a how can an
[18:21] administration want to put us into a
[18:23] recession to where then they have to
[18:24] print money again to get us out? Uh the
[18:27] belief that they're going to get the
[18:28] investments and stuff as they go through
[18:30] this without the job losses maybe over
[18:33] time, but that's not the way these
[18:35] things work. They are complex systems
[18:36] and you always always miss something in
[18:39] terms of the possibility of what goes
[18:40] wrong. Uh think of China with their zero
[18:43] COVID policy. They haven't been able to
[18:45] get people to come out and start
[18:46] spending again. At some point, if you do
[18:49] material damage, it becomes a
[18:50] psychological thing. That's what the
[18:52] depression was about. That's why it has
[18:54] the name, the depression. Sometimes you
[18:56] can't get people to spend. And when you
[18:57] have a country based on consumption and
[19:00] based on taking risk, that's what can
[19:01] change very quickly. Now, I wanted to
[19:03] get into the other danger of this and
[19:06] the reason that Gavin Baker and and Brad
[19:08] Gersonner need to be listened to because
[19:10] they are both technology people and they
[19:12] realize the damage that will be done not
[19:14] only to earnings for tech companies
[19:16] which started to happen uh last week.
[19:18] Their stocks are down obviously the
[19:19] most, but also the AI situation in terms
[19:22] of the buildout which will start to
[19:24] become a story in my opinion this week.
[19:25] So, this is from Apple's 10K. The
[19:28] company's operations performance depends
[19:29] significantly on global and regional
[19:31] economic conditions and adverse economic
[19:33] conditions can materially adversely
[19:35] affect the company's business results of
[19:36] operation. You can go through the rest
[19:38] of what I highlighted on there and pause
[19:40] it. The reality is Apple has said this
[19:42] inner 10k forever that if something
[19:44] happens geopolitically it will hurt
[19:46] this. They still make approximately 90%
[19:48] of their iPhones in China. Uh Mag 7
[19:51] stocks overall generate 49% of their
[19:53] revenues overseas. They are all exposed
[19:56] to global trade, to the system, to
[19:58] tariffs, to everything. Regulations,
[20:00] non-trade barriers, everything. So
[20:03] that's why these companies are getting
[20:04] hurt more than say the S&P 493, but
[20:07] everyone's getting hurt. But I bring
[20:09] that up because it'll become important
[20:10] for Bitcoin at the end. Now, this is
[20:12] where I go back into Gavin Baker. This
[20:14] is in the same post he put, uh, but this
[20:16] is on the AI side. Geopolitically,
[20:18] nothing matters more than winning AI.
[20:19] These tariffs are constructed
[20:21] essentially guarantee that America will
[20:22] lose AI by making America the most
[20:24] expensive place on earth to build AI
[20:26] data centers. This is so critical to
[20:29] what's going on and it will come out
[20:32] more and more. This was out on Friday
[20:33] night with Trump tariffs. Even AI could
[20:36] get more expensive. So the buildout, how
[20:38] are these companies that now are seeing
[20:40] their stock prices fall and the
[20:42] buildouts getting more expensive? How
[20:45] are they going to put as much money in
[20:46] data centers based on what happened on
[20:48] Wednesday? At the same time, data
[20:50] centers growing appetite. They need rare
[20:52] earth metals. The problem is China hits
[20:56] back at US tariffs with rare earth
[20:58] export controls. So immediately in terms
[21:00] of getting in this, there is the unknown
[21:03] consequences that come along. So if you
[21:05] really believe you're in a race with
[21:06] China in AI, one of the problems you run
[21:09] into is we have shut off their uh
[21:12] semiconductors. they still had Deep
[21:13] Seek. Now they're saying they'll shut
[21:15] off Rare Earths in terms of going out.
[21:17] This is just a battle that just doesn't
[21:19] uh doesn't end well in terms of what's
[21:21] going on. Uh Howard Mark spoke and
[21:24] basically the only thing I wanted to see
[21:25] is Howard's a smart not a smart guy, one
[21:27] of the smartest people in financial
[21:29] world. Uh we know much less today than
[21:32] usual. The world economy was shook up
[21:34] like a snow globe by the events of the
[21:37] last seven days. I think that is a great
[21:38] visual. That's what I think absolutely
[21:41] has happened. I think it was meant to
[21:42] happen as kind of shock therapy as uh uh
[21:47] Gersonner brought up. The problem is and
[21:50] I mentioned this with my regime shift
[21:51] and how hedge funds are lever. This is
[21:53] the place where you could see more and
[21:56] more problems. Hedge funds hit with
[21:58] steepest margin calls since 2020 COVID
[22:00] crisis. When you shift things this
[22:02] quickly, it leads to losses and hedge
[22:05] funds are levered and we went from a
[22:07] period of low volatility, high
[22:09] positioning, high growth. you just
[22:11] couldn't get all this off. Plus, this
[22:12] was outside the distribution. Uh, I've
[22:14] shown this chart before. Uh, this is an
[22:17] overlay of the Bloomberg Hedge Index,
[22:20] which is the pink line. We haven't got
[22:22] the numbers for March yet. We know March
[22:24] was a down month. And this is it
[22:25] overlaid with the three-month earnings
[22:27] per share revisions. Basically, hedge
[22:30] funds make money off growth, whether
[22:31] it's because of credit being stable, o
[22:33] all things being stable, we have now
[22:36] driven it all the way back to the 2024
[22:38] levels. there are losses that are
[22:40] happening. This creates a weakened
[22:42] system. Uh this just highlights that
[22:44] hedge funds typically have long
[22:46] sensitivity to credit. Not a surprise.
[22:48] But again, when growth comes down and
[22:50] credit goes wider, you have a problem.
[22:51] Uh soft data continues to be horrible.
[22:55] Uh we had the new orders, less
[22:56] inventories, which collapsed 11 points
[22:59] uh for the quarter. Uh it is the worst
[23:01] quarterly time since we were in the
[23:03] recession here, recession here. uh
[23:06] basically you're just at a point where
[23:08] it's very very difficult
[23:10] uh to look at the soft data and not
[23:12] expect that this is going to turn into
[23:14] something worse. That being said, the
[23:16] payroll numbers were good again. And
[23:17] here's the 3mon diffusion index which is
[23:20] still sitting at 59% nowhere near what
[23:23] is happening during a recession. Uh and
[23:25] the bad news as I mentioned is Trump
[23:27] points to margin job
[23:29] search his tariffs are already working
[23:31] after two days. So, this is what we're
[23:33] dealing with um in terms of the logic
[23:36] for the markets or the lack of care. The
[23:38] good news is the jobless claims still
[23:41] are not showing anything. So, I brought
[23:42] this chart up just again. Yes, the S&P
[23:44] has built this in, but we don't have a
[23:47] situation yet where people are losing
[23:49] jobs. When people start losing jobs,
[23:51] that's when the spending really starts
[23:52] to freeze. That's when credit becomes an
[23:54] issue. Um, as of right now, the jobless
[23:57] claims, the four-week average is the
[23:58] same level it was as the first quarter
[24:00] of 2020 2022. Uh, shocking to many
[24:04] people, but again, a labor shortage and
[24:06] a whole a whole bunch of reasons where
[24:08] people don't believe even now that he
[24:10] could possibly stay with this goal of
[24:13] putting us into a recession. So, I think
[24:15] they're going to be slow to fire people
[24:16] because if you fire people before your
[24:18] business really slows down uh and before
[24:20] you have earnings losses, and that's why
[24:23] I think this probably goes on for
[24:25] another 30 to 45 days based on the Tik
[24:27] Tok situation and some of the
[24:29] negotiations. There's probably going to
[24:30] be some positive headlines and deals
[24:32] made across the way to show that he can
[24:34] make a deal. So, that's why I have this
[24:36] belief that we'll probably have another
[24:38] day, maybe two days of this intensity
[24:40] and then maybe we can make a at least a
[24:43] short-term low and start to try to build
[24:45] in some kind of a bottom where we retest
[24:47] and we spend a lot of time at 4700 to
[24:50] 5200. That would be an optimal goal. All
[24:52] right, some positive numerology stuff
[24:54] for you guys. So, at least you have some
[24:55] optimism that a this is not yet
[24:59] something that's abnormal and secondly,
[25:00] can you fall this much and actually make
[25:02] a reversal if he does turn a little bit?
[25:04] And the answer is yes. So Charlie Ble,
[25:06] I'm thinking three of three things he
[25:07] did this week. They're all good. Number
[25:09] one, just to show that uh you know, we
[25:12] had a draw down. Uh the draw down even
[25:15] in the S&P at 17%. It's happened many
[25:17] many times. This shows the total return
[25:21] for the year. So this includes these
[25:23] numbers. And what you see is there's a
[25:25] lot of time, you know, times in here
[25:27] where even when you have this kind of
[25:28] draw down, you still end up for the
[25:30] year, uh, or still end up much higher
[25:33] from where you were. Uh, another one
[25:35] just in terms of the S&P down 8.2% in
[25:38] the first 63 days of trading. This was
[25:40] through Thursday. Uh, believe it or not,
[25:42] you know, price day from the 64th to the
[25:47] end of the year. A lot of positive
[25:49] times. Now the end of the year itself
[25:50] for full year not as great but these are
[25:53] the numbers that go from the 63rd day
[25:55] on. So you do have a lot of times where
[25:57] from this you can have a down beginning
[25:59] you can still finish up. The VIX spiked
[26:01] nearly 40% closed above 30 for the first
[26:03] time since last August. What happens to
[26:05] following the biggest volatility spikes
[26:07] and again the numbers are really really
[26:09] good out a year. They're really really
[26:11] good out six months. uh another one that
[26:14] came through uh from him that he put out
[26:16] there, it fell 10 and a half% over the
[26:18] last two trading days, the fifth biggest
[26:20] two-day decline since 1950. Uh and
[26:23] again, one year out, you've been up
[26:24] every single time from that point. And
[26:26] those are big numbers. So, historically,
[26:29] you have a reason to be positive. Um
[26:31] here's another VIX one. Same type of
[26:34] thing. All positive going out. So, we
[26:36] did hit panic. Uh this is a pretty good
[26:39] one in terms of uh Jason Gford. The S&P
[26:42] is lower in October is now. This is S&P
[26:45] after a greater than 4% loss, then
[26:47] greater than 5% loss. So back toback
[26:48] greater than 4% losses. Uh six months
[26:51] later, every single one of them is up.
[26:53] So again, you go through this, you have
[26:55] at least something to go up from hope,
[26:57] but uh you're still getting this. Trump
[26:59] says he won't back down from the global
[27:01] trade war. Uh you've got Lutnik saying
[27:04] no chance to back up taxes. I'm not
[27:06] going to read all this, but basically
[27:07] they they've got the same rhetoric
[27:09] coming out. uh Bessant it's a stock
[27:11] market drop is a mag seven drop it's not
[27:13] a MAGA one so they're basically going
[27:16] out there and trying to keep the base
[27:17] supportive of what they're doing even
[27:19] with tells Americans to hang tough
[27:21] through economic revolution as stocks
[27:23] plummet it won't be easy you know he's
[27:26] he's he's definitely keeping his base uh
[27:28] where it is uh in terms of them wanting
[27:31] to fight this and just go through it
[27:33] which is fine uh and I think it's going
[27:36] to stay that way I bring this up my
[27:38] friend Marco Papich whose work I really
[27:40] love. He wrote this in September. Um you
[27:43] guys can pause it again and read through
[27:44] his points in here, but the main point
[27:46] is it's really really hard when the
[27:50] world is this interconnected and more
[27:55] importantly when it's multipolar and
[27:58] people can move away to other people. So
[28:01] what Trump has done is basically said to
[28:03] the world, you're not doing business
[28:05] with us unless you're paying us money.
[28:07] And the hope is that they all come to
[28:09] negotiate on their hands and knees
[28:11] because the US is a large consumer and
[28:15] by itself it is the largest consumer but
[28:17] when you add up the rest of the globe
[28:19] it's much big the rest of the globe is
[28:21] much bigger than the US. So if they all
[28:23] deal with each other and it's
[28:24] isolationist you can't have a problem.
[28:26] So he just wrote this that eventually
[28:28] smarter heads will come into into play.
[28:30] this is back then and he's been one of
[28:32] the people that really believes that
[28:34] this China war has started uh since 2016
[28:39] uh presidential election. So in 15 there
[28:42] was already this trade thing going on
[28:44] from both sides. So this is uh a
[28:46] situation where hopefully this is meant
[28:48] to be the final cleansing of this and
[28:50] China and the US can come to some kind
[28:52] of agreement to reduce the trade
[28:54] deficit. Uh and we'll see what they can
[28:57] do once they talk. uh Charlie Gasparino
[29:01] basically coming out and saying that
[29:02] Besson is trying to moderate things. I
[29:04] only put this in there because I think
[29:06] you're going to start getting more and
[29:07] more stuff where people realize that if
[29:10] they're staying attached to this whole
[29:11] plan and there just doesn't seem to be a
[29:13] plan that doesn't lead to job losses at
[29:15] this point. This is different than what
[29:17] a lot of them said, including Besset in
[29:19] most of his interviews at the beginning
[29:20] where he said job losses were not
[29:22] something Trump wanted. Well, with what
[29:23] he's done this week, uh, and maybe the
[29:25] move surprised him. He's not going to
[29:27] admit it at this point because that's
[29:28] not part of his personality, but a 10%
[29:30] fall in two days after you have
[29:32] liberation day could not be what he
[29:34] expected to have happen. Uh, and I think
[29:36] that's the issue that comes out of this
[29:38] is it had been very quiet beforehand uh,
[29:40] with the market not down more than 6%
[29:42] and now all of a sudden uh, it's a
[29:44] different story. Uh, I bring up some
[29:46] points of why this negotiation is part
[29:48] of the things he's promised. He promised
[29:50] to Russia Ukraine end of the war. He
[29:52] needs China as part of the negotiation.
[29:54] So that makes this
[29:55] difficult. Didn't talk about this last
[29:57] week because I didn't think it really
[29:58] mattered because this goes on all the
[30:00] time. But China's been doing exercises
[30:02] around Taiwan. If there was ever a time
[30:05] where China looked and said, I okay, if
[30:08] this is what the trade war is, then we
[30:10] might as well make this a a a war for
[30:13] real and make sure that the chips are
[30:15] isolated. And again, uh, some of the
[30:19] risks that you're playing with, uh, when
[30:21] you're out there saying you're not going
[30:22] to spend money and you're going to put
[30:24] tariffs on everyone without talking. A
[30:26] little hope in here. Um, the Tik Tok
[30:28] deal,
[30:30] uh, didn't happen. And the reason it
[30:31] didn't happen, we hope to continue
[30:34] working in good faith with China, who I
[30:36] understand are not very happy about our
[30:38] reciprocal
[30:39] tariffs. Uh, it goes on to again, we we
[30:43] don't want Tik Tok to go dark. We look
[30:44] forward to working with Tik Tok and
[30:47] China to close the deal. Thank you for
[30:49] your attention to this matter. Uh again,
[30:52] if he wants to get Tik Tok done, which
[30:54] he's trying to get done, he's got to
[30:56] work with China on this because they
[30:58] stopped the deal from happening. Uh
[31:00] there was some positive things. I mean,
[31:03] there were more exemptions than what I
[31:05] think people thought. So, originally
[31:06] when he did the tariffs, about a third
[31:08] of the imports are actually excluded. um
[31:10] he kept the Canada Mexico uh exclusion.
[31:14] Uh Israel had already said they were
[31:16] going to scrap it, but they were given a
[31:17] a tariff rate as well. Uh so maybe, you
[31:21] know, again, room for negotiation. Trump
[31:24] says Vietnam wants to cut its taxes, its
[31:26] tariffs to zero. So you do have at least
[31:29] people willing to um to work on this. Uh
[31:33] but again, it's an all-around blockade.
[31:36] Meaning if in the past when we put
[31:38] tariffs on China, if they built things
[31:40] in Mexico or they built things in
[31:42] Vietnam, they were getting around them.
[31:44] So now what Trump has done is basically
[31:46] said, no matter where you go, there's an
[31:48] all-around blockade. So he's trying to
[31:50] apply pressure and trying to get
[31:53] everybody to negotiate, not end up in
[31:55] the same situation with tariffs he did
[31:56] last time. Uh this where I move to
[31:59] finish up on Bitcoin. So last week,
[32:02] Bitcoin outperformed. I got a lot of
[32:04] people asking me why, particularly on
[32:06] Friday. It was two very, very strong
[32:08] relative days. And when I say strong
[32:10] relative days, it was down about 1 and a
[32:11] half% for the two days after. But the
[32:14] big thing was relative to all other
[32:16] assets, uh, it was much better,
[32:19] including gold. When you beta adjusted,
[32:21] it was dramatically better. So, people
[32:23] notice that normally if you have a 10%
[32:25] fall in the S&P, you'd probably have a
[32:28] 15ish, maybe 20-ish% fall in Bitcoin.
[32:32] And yet, for the week, it was down less
[32:34] than the S&P. So, what happened? Um,
[32:38] Bitcoin is outside the system. I've said
[32:40] this repeatedly. Everyone who is done
[32:44] their homework on
[32:45] Bitcoin, Bitcoin is the way the digital
[32:48] economy has money. It was the white
[32:50] paper that came out. But more
[32:52] importantly, the system is breaking
[32:54] down. And this week was kind of a death
[32:56] nail for the system. Whether you believe
[32:57] the tariffs are uh going to be reduced
[33:00] or not, there are tariffs, they are not
[33:02] coming off. And this is now an a
[33:05] beginning or a countdown of a gl of a
[33:07] massive change. You want to use it as
[33:09] one of the historic days. This will be a
[33:11] historic day in terms of breaking the
[33:13] current system that we've been in for a
[33:15] long time post World War II. So, Bitcoin
[33:18] is outside of it. Meaning if you're
[33:20] going to do trade, Russia uses crypto
[33:22] and Chinese and Indian oil trade. It's
[33:24] already going on. Uh for all you gold
[33:26] lovers, you're not putting a bunch of
[33:28] gold on a ship and shipping it to uh to
[33:31] China uh to exchange things. So how
[33:35] you're moving things around where it has
[33:37] to be immediate where you know it's
[33:38] there. Crypto is something that will
[33:40] gain steam. So crypto this week in my
[33:43] opinion as it held firm as stocks lose 5
[33:46] trillion it's starting to become
[33:48] something that people realize rather
[33:50] than say it's a hedge against inflation
[33:52] it's a hedge against this it's just a
[33:54] hedge against the system the system is
[33:56] breaking down Bitcoin's correlation with
[33:58] stock shows signs of breaking down
[34:01] Michael Sailor said there are no tariffs
[34:03] on Bitcoin and everyone I talked to even
[34:05] people in crypto I don't think they
[34:07] thought about it in the way that that's
[34:09] true and that's important if you want to
[34:11] have trade and you want to move things
[34:13] around, a neutral currency is a good
[34:15] thing. A a neutral reserve currency is
[34:18] good. Uh here's just the chart of of uh
[34:21] Bitcoin over the S&P, which is the white
[34:24] line. So this is the skyrocket move
[34:26] higher. And then this is Q's. So again,
[34:29] I've heard so many people say that why
[34:32] would I buy Bitcoin when it's just the
[34:33] NASDAQ? Well, for all of you who have
[34:36] waited for that, you have made a big
[34:38] mistake at this point because the NASDAQ
[34:39] and the MAG 7 is going down. And Bitcoin
[34:42] outperformed last year, it outperformed
[34:44] the year before and now it's
[34:45] outperforming this year in a down year.
[34:48] So, you lost not owning it on the way up
[34:51] and now you're losing it on the way
[34:53] down. And I'm going to explain why this
[34:54] is only going to get worse. Uh, and why
[34:57] you should be moving moving moving money
[35:00] away because they are all exposed to the
[35:02] system. Dan Tapiro, uh, really good
[35:05] macro person who wrote this as well.
[35:08] Moment of realization for Bitcoin.
[35:10] Couldn't agree more. Uh, tariffs
[35:12] crushing analog markets, analog verse
[35:15] the digital. Completely agree. Uh, he's
[35:18] got Bitcoin over the S&P there. Jack
[35:20] Mers put this out in February. We are
[35:23] witnessing the unwind of the World War
[35:24] II economic order. Could not agree more.
[35:27] Uh, Jack is very good on talking about
[35:29] this stuff. He has talked about it as
[35:31] the same way that this is outside the
[35:33] system. A move back to a neutral reserve
[35:35] currency. This is back in February
[35:37] before the tariffs. This is another post
[35:40] that he had up there just highlighting
[35:41] again public debt outstanding. This is
[35:44] not going down. So with what happened
[35:47] this week, the debt is going to have to
[35:49] get bigger because we are going to have
[35:51] a recession if he doesn't turn around.
[35:53] And with a recession, you're going to
[35:55] have to print more money or default on
[35:57] the debt. Either
[35:58] way, this does not work in terms of the
[36:01] favor of not printing money. Uh Matthew
[36:04] Seagull from uh Vanek. At the same time,
[36:07] the weaponization of trade and financial
[36:09] infrastructure continues to drive
[36:11] interest rates and neutral settlement
[36:12] rails. Uh neutral settlement rails are
[36:15] going to grow in terms of what people
[36:16] are looking for. Here's gold for the two
[36:18] days. Here's Bitcoin. You can't even see
[36:20] it. Gold was one of its worst days in
[36:22] the last year. for Bitcoin. It was
[36:24] barely a day uh barely two days at all.
[36:27] Less volatility than normal. I'm coming
[36:30] back. This is the Apple uh 10K. Again,
[36:33] this is this again I bring this up
[36:36] because remember the Mag 7 are exposed
[36:39] to the global system. This is the reason
[36:42] why these are not software. These are
[36:44] not US companies. These are software
[36:46] companies who happen to get their
[36:47] revenues from all over the US. So when
[36:49] you put tariffs on and you start
[36:50] breaking down the trade or you start
[36:52] breaking the supply chains in the ca in
[36:54] in the case of Apple all of these things
[36:56] exposed you equities that's why I say
[36:59] Bitcoin is the S&P 500 digital economy
[37:02] if you do not have 5 to 10% of your
[37:04] money in it you're not diversified
[37:07] enough for what is going on right now
[37:08] and if anything from this week this was
[37:10] not a warning shot this was your last
[37:12] chance to change to at least diversify
[37:14] and move some stuff out here's the chart
[37:16] of Bitcoin versus the Mag 7, like I
[37:20] said, it outperformed in in 23,
[37:23] outperformed in 24. Beautiful cup and
[37:26] handle formation and starting to break
[37:28] out. What I fully expect here is that
[37:30] whenever the MAG7 bottoms or the equity
[37:33] market finds a bottom and rallies,
[37:35] Bitcoin had a lower bait on the way
[37:37] down, it'll have a higher bait on the
[37:38] way up. And that's what you want from
[37:40] anything. And remember, Trump is going
[37:42] after the MAG7. These these leaders sat
[37:46] at the inauguration. They're getting
[37:48] pounded on. You've have you've got Brad
[37:50] Gersonner. You've got Gavin Baker,
[37:52] owners of these companies that were
[37:54] surprised. There is no way that you
[37:56] cannot look and realize that he does not
[37:58] care about these companies. And he does
[38:02] care about Bitcoin and they continue to
[38:04] do things in the administration. Here
[38:05] are the returns of Bitcoin relative to
[38:08] the Mag 7. Again, it's outperformed by
[38:10] 18% this year, 32% last year, 24% the
[38:13] year before. Making money in the way
[38:15] down, making money on the way up. Uh SEC
[38:18] says stable coins aren't securities that
[38:19] require registration. So, this uh came
[38:21] out this week. Uh you wouldn't have seen
[38:23] this because it happened just yesterday
[38:27] uh or Friday since I'm doing this on
[38:29] Saturday. Uh stable coins really
[38:32] important. Again, I've talked about this
[38:33] before. Stable coins are the network
[38:35] effects. The transactions globally are
[38:37] going to increase with stable coins.
[38:39] More and more of the economy is going
[38:41] digital. Less and less of it is going to
[38:43] be the old school trading through send
[38:47] me your money, go through it. It is
[38:48] going to be done in a place where you
[38:50] get your money immediately overnight.
[38:52] And that's going to be in stable coins.
[38:54] And unlike in 2022 when the market went
[38:56] lower as rates were going higher, stable
[38:58] coin market cap went down that entire
[39:01] time into 2023.
[39:03] Stable coin market cap continues to go
[39:06] higher and there's been more and more
[39:07] stable coin creations. Uh I mentioned
[39:10] custodia bank last week. Last three
[39:12] slides. Uh Michael Sailor Micro
[39:16] Strategy.
[39:18] Uh Wall Street has been dead wrong. I
[39:21] want to point out to everyone who has
[39:22] been posting an X that this is the
[39:24] biggest Ponzi scheme. When the tide of
[39:27] liquidity goes out, you find out who's
[39:29] naked. Here's the Mag 7 now down 12% in
[39:33] the last 6 months. Here's Micro
[39:35] Strategy. I picked six months because
[39:37] this is before the election. So,
[39:40] everybody went up from the election and
[39:42] now as the policies are put in place,
[39:44] Micro Strategy is up
[39:47] 66% while the Mag 7 are down 12th. So
[39:52] the the the company that has a moat on
[39:56] the moat of the new system which just
[39:58] kind of got its birth this week with the
[40:01] end of the old system the true birth. So
[40:03] the first white the white paper came out
[40:05] during the great financial crisis. You
[40:07] had a massive move in COVID when MMT
[40:10] became a thing during 2020 and now you
[40:13] have trade breaking down. So you had
[40:15] inflation, you had giving money to the
[40:17] banks to repair the banking system and
[40:19] do QE. And now you have the end of
[40:21] global trade. You can do your own math
[40:23] on this. Bitcoin has been gathering
[40:25] steam and gathering more money around
[40:27] the globe each time that this goes on.
[40:29] And here's Micro Strategies performance
[40:31] year to date. So in a year where stocks
[40:33] are collapsing, how can this not be a
[40:35] big story when everyone is fading it?
[40:37] You made 350% the last two years owning
[40:40] Micro Strategy. the company that has a
[40:43] moat on the moat of the next system and
[40:48] it's up
[40:49] 1.38%. Keep fading it at your own risk.
[40:52] And finally, how can this not be
[40:54] perfect? He put this out yesterday.
[40:56] Today's market reaction to tariffs is a
[40:58] reminder. Inflation is just a tip of the
[40:59] iceberg. Capital faces delution from
[41:01] taxes, regulation, competition,
[41:05] obsolescence, and unforeseen events.
[41:07] Bitcoin offers resilience in a world
[41:09] full of hidden risks. Uh that's it for
[41:11] me this week. Uh good luck this week. Uh
[41:14] hopefully uh we made the low last week
[41:17] and closing low. Uh Monday could get
[41:20] sloppy again based on what we've seen.
[41:23] Uh but I have faith that we've built in
[41:25] enough for the economy in terms of where
[41:27] the recession is. Uh I do think uh
[41:30] there's unintended consequences that
[41:32] have shown up in the two days. And even
[41:34] though I don't think uh Donald Trump is
[41:36] going to turn uh away, I do think if he
[41:39] signs some deals, we can at least
[41:41] because we're more closely uh or even
[41:44] cheap relative to the economic and
[41:47] earnings realization. Uh if we can move
[41:50] things down and start doing some deals
[41:52] over the course of the next month, I
[41:54] think you can build the bottom here. And
[41:56] then by the time we get into the second
[41:57] half of the year, uh we'll see if we
[41:59] actually get any job losses. And if we
[42:01] don't, we can start to focus on tax cuts
[42:03] and the market will very very very
[42:06] quickly just like it did in CO start to
[42:07] build in where the economy will be in
[42:09] the first quarter of next year and not
[42:11] where the economy will be in the fourth
[42:13] the second quarter of this year. Uh
[42:15] that's it for me uh this week. Uh long
[42:17] one but a lot going on. Back.
