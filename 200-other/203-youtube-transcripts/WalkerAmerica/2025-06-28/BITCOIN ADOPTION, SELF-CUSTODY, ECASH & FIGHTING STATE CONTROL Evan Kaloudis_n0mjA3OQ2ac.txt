[00:00] I think if we just if Bitcoin stays
[00:02] where it's at with the small community
[00:03] it has and it's just used as it is now
[00:08] store value ETFs shiny rock under the
[00:11] bed gold 2.0 I don't know like I'll
[00:12] consider it a colossal failure. So we
[00:14] need to build out these circular
[00:16] economies and make sure Bitcoin gets
[00:17] used for commerce everywhere really.
[00:19] Bitcoin needs everyone. Bitcoin needs
[00:22] you and it success is not inevitable and
[00:25] the more that individuals act we act
[00:28] collectively in pushing this technology
[00:31] then the higher chance it is to succeed
[00:33] and the harder it is for the state to
[00:34] snuff it out. We still have a long way
[00:36] to go. A lot of our friends are still
[00:38] being prosecuted. The tornado cash guys
[00:40] are still in court. The samurai wallet
[00:43] devs are still in court. Not all states
[00:46] or countries have the same asurances
[00:47] about self custody or mining or these L2
[00:52] services that we're running. And you
[00:54] know, like I said, like these things
[00:56] could change at the drop of a hat. Maybe
[00:58] even this administration changes their
[00:59] tune. If you look at the geopolitical
[01:01] climate, a lot of that stuff could be
[01:03] used as an excuse to crack down on us.
[01:07] So, you know, my message to all the
[01:09] builders out there, to the people
[01:10] pushing the software, is like when we're
[01:12] given an inch, let's take a mile. Let's
[01:14] keep pressing forward while we have the
[01:16] runway. Let's use it. I personally think
[01:19] that we're going to win a lot of battles
[01:21] over the next 4 years duration of this
[01:23] admin, right? We're going to still lose
[01:26] some, but we certainly have more runway
[01:28] and leeway than we previously did. So,
[01:31] let's build. Let's build. Let's build.
[01:33] Let's ship. Let's keep pushing stuff in
[01:34] the right direction.
[01:43] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:45] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:47] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:50] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:53] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:55] bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:58] right now, remember you are still early.

[02:28] for everything else. Without further
[02:30] ado, let's get into this Bitcoin talk.
[02:40] I don't think I've ever made it through
[02:42] an entire Lex Freedman podcast.
 I I
[02:45] don't I don't get the appeal either.
[02:46] Like I'm I'm really not a huge fan,
[02:50] you know? It's like respect to him for
[02:52] what he's built. Like that's super cool.
[02:54] It's just like that style of like, "All
[02:57] right, let me ask you about your mother
[03:01] and how that relates to geopolitics."
[03:03] It's just like I'm I don't know, man.
[03:05] Like, and this is this is coming from
[03:07] somebody who like occasionally is like
[03:09] told they have like a weird voice. It's
[03:11] like something about the voice, the vibe
[03:13] is like it just you can't listen to it
[03:15] for that long.
 Yeah. I don't know what
[03:17] it is. I mean, you know, it's not like
[03:19] that we don't have like equally boring
[03:21] podcasts in Bitcoin, right? Oh, you got
[03:24] I got it on uh Bitcoin Review with Rulo.
[03:27] You know, it really goes into the weed.
[03:29] So technical, but
 like that's really the
[03:31] the show you put on uh as you're trying
[03:33] to get you know, your 40 hours per week.
[03:35] You know, you got to be listening at all
[03:36] times. You put that on just in time for
[03:38] bedtime, you know?
 Dude, every everybody
[03:41] always says that that show is like uh
[03:43] you know, whatever like you know, very
[03:45] boring like we'll put you to bed. I
[03:47] don't know. I like maybe it's just
[03:48] because like even though I'm not super
[03:50] technical, I I am somewhat of a nerd.
[03:52] Like I always enjoy that show. Like I I
[03:54] have I have I I would have difficulty
[03:56] falling asleep to it. I like NVK too.
[03:59] Like I feel like he always he brings a
[04:01] great energy to it.
 Yeah. Yeah. It's
[04:03] like tongue and cheek, self-aware
[04:04] enough, you know, like and he's got like
[04:06] a good read on things, but also, you
[04:09] know, willing to say like, "Oh, I don't
[04:10] know XYZ. Anyone know more about this?"
[04:13] You know, so
 Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
 So,
[04:16] yeah. Exactly. Doing that again soon at
[04:19] some point.
[04:21] Um,
[04:23] but yeah, man, I'm just excited.
[04:25] Wherever you want to take the
[04:26] conversation,
[04:28] uh, basically willing to take it. We can
[04:31] talk about Cashew and Zeus. We can talk
[04:34] about some of the new stuff we're doing
[04:36] with Zeus Pay. We're starting to do, you
[04:38] know, digital checkout for goods and
[04:40] expanding our point of sale. Talk about,
[04:43] you know, what we're doing to onboard a
[04:45] lot of merchants. We got a lot of a lot
[04:48] of companies queued up right now that
[04:50] we're going to be on boarding very soon.
[04:52] So hoping to get a
[04:55] you know uh just
[04:59] little bit of momentum
 series of
[05:01] announcements going but nothing I could
[05:03] say yet unfortunately.
 Oh you're going
[05:05] to tease me like that. I mean, Evan, uh,
[05:08] you you guys have had quite a uh, like I
[05:11] feel like Zeus has been on quite an
[05:13] interesting journey cuz I was I was
[05:15] thinking about this cuz like I I've had
[05:16] Zeus downloaded for a while and I I was
[05:18] going back and am I remembering
[05:20] correctly? You guys were initially just
[05:22] a way to connect to your node remotely,
[05:26] right? Like that was the original like
[05:28] Yeah, that was that's still most of our
[05:29] lifetime. So
 yeah,
 let's say we started
[05:33] back in like 2019, the fall. I think
[05:36] we're coming up on like six and a half
[05:37] years now.
 Damn.
 And we started just
[05:40] like a remote controller. So it started
[05:42] okay, you know, L & D was the powerhouse
[05:45] implementation, right? Still still is,
[05:47] but you know, some of the other ones are
[05:49] catching up. It's getting interesting.
[05:50] So we start with L &D.
[05:52] We added core lightning. Then we added
[05:56] like L & D hub. Then we added all these
[05:58] other like alternate connection types.
[06:00] So now you could do like Nostra wallet
[06:02] connect.
[06:04] Um and then of course the last uh two
[06:09] years we we put the wallet in the phone,
[06:12] the note in the phone we call it, right?
[06:14] And uh
 it's great for memes also.
 Yeah.
[06:17] That that we just really went crazy with
[06:19] that meme cycle. uh with, you know, just
[06:22] shooting the [ __ ] with Matt on Citadel
[06:24] Dispatch. Um, you know, have have a
[06:28] really long history with that show and
[06:31] uh yeah, just people just clung on to it
[06:34] and had a lot of great meme ability. Um,
[06:38] but yeah, still like you know, we still
[06:40] have a long ways to go. the
[06:43] note in the phone was like a great way
[06:45] to lower the barrier to entry into this
[06:47] whole thing. But, you know, it doesn't
[06:49] really stop there. Like with Cashew, we
[06:51] made it even easier. Really addresses,
[06:54] you know, that economic barrier you
[06:56] have. So,
[06:59] you know, self-custody in itself has
[07:04] really high cost, you know, in terms of
[07:06] the transaction fees, in terms of
[07:07] responsibility.
[07:09] uh for someone who wants to just start
[07:10] accepting payments especially in you
[07:13] know the little economies we're building
[07:16] up with stuff like noster and you get
[07:18] one sat zaps um you know that's not
[07:21] really conducive to being like okay I
[07:23] got to put you know 6,000 7,000 8,000
[07:26] sats for a whitening channel and I don't
[07:28] want to do that like how are you going
[07:29] to convince someone to take this plunge
[07:31] into bitcoin and set up a self-custodial
[07:34] channel when it has this cost unless you
[07:36] know whoever's onboarding them is
[07:38] willing to bear
[07:39] So now with Cashew, of course you have
[07:42] trade-offs. It's custodial. You don't
[07:44] have access to the, you know, the
[07:46] underlying asset, but you get to, you
[07:50] know, skip this cost. You get a
[07:52] lightning address that you could take
[07:53] with you as you upgrade down the road.
[07:56] You can take that lightning address, put
[07:58] it into Noster, start getting your first
[08:01] zapped, have your first aha moment with
[08:03] Lightning, and be like, "Oh, this
[08:05] permissionless.
[08:07] uh I could do these instant transfers
[08:08] there. It's very cheap. I can get paid
[08:11] for my content. Um I think that's super
[08:14] powerful. And then we as the wallet, we
[08:18] can sort of give the user guidance. You
[08:21] know, it it's one thing to like wrap
[08:25] your head around starting to use a new
[08:26] currency. don't really necessarily need
[08:29] to be inundated with like, okay, uh,
[08:32] receiving capacity, uh, sending
[08:34] capacity, how what the hell is a
[08:35] channel? It's sort of nice that you
[08:37] could push that back now and say, okay,
[08:40] get started, do it this way, maybe you
[08:42] should, uh, copy your your seed down,
[08:45] right? But other than that,
 it's pretty
[08:48] seamless, easy. You don't have to worry
[08:49] about that stuff. But then, you know, as
[08:51] you're carrying a larger balance, as it
[08:54] makes sense for you to do so like
[08:57] economically, when like economic
[08:59] self-custody is feasible, which is like
[09:02] a whole other can of worms. We'd get
[09:03] into that if you ever want with the new
[09:05] L2s coming up. Um,
 but yeah, when it's
[09:08] time like we'll give you that
[09:10] educational material like, oh, this is
[09:12] what self custody is. This is what you
[09:14] have right now. we have now cashew has
[09:18] really great privacy properties, but
[09:21] it's still sort of like a bank account.
[09:22] You don't really have control of your
[09:24] funds. But if you press this button, you
[09:27] can hop over and for a fee, get a
[09:30] channel,
[09:32] uh go to self-custody, become sovereign,
[09:34] and really control your, you know,
[09:37] financial destiny. you have full control
[09:39] of your money in a way that most people
[09:43] really have never had before, in a way
[09:46] that's, you know, even greater than
[09:47] holding calf. So, um,
[09:51] yeah, it's interesting. It's it's it's
[09:52] been really wellreceived the last couple
[09:54] weeks, like
[09:56] what is it, three weeks since we
[09:58] launched onto the app stores and then we
[10:00] did like about, you know, two months
[10:01] before that of beta. And, you know,
[10:05] people are just loving it. Um,
[10:08] and you know, you sort it's not sort of
[10:10] just like one or the other. Like you can
[10:13] upgrade to self custody and still reap
[10:15] the benefits of Cashew and have like a
[10:19] super easy to use Lightning address. You
[10:22] can then have the wallet automatically
[10:25] sweep your cashew balance to self-
[10:27] custody when it makes sense at whatever
[10:29] threshold you want to incur the fees at,
[10:32] which is huge. like having that auto
[10:34] sweep capability, I think.
 Yeah,
[10:37] absolutely. And uh you know, it it's
[10:40] it's not that I can't spin up a node and
[10:42] just have that on all the time, but I
[10:45] just I just like the convenience of of
[10:47] having it like that, too. Like I'm using
[10:48] the Cashew auto sweep functionality
[10:51] myself on my Zaps right now. And um
[10:55] yeah, it's it's it's just fantastic. I
[10:57] think it's like a very happy medium. And
[11:02] you know, it's it's like I think we're
[11:04] this is also really uniquely positioned
[11:05] here. Like how many other wallets are
[11:08] really going to tell you, oh, time to
[11:10] get into self custody, you know, like
[11:12] it's only when you get into those jams
[11:15] on these other platforms where um they
[11:18] restrict access to your region, your
[11:20] account gets flagged.
[11:22] uh you know basically when you get
[11:24] rugged that
[11:26] you know you've learned the importance
[11:28] of holding your own keys and and having
[11:30] control of the asset of being
[11:32] self-custodial in Bitcoin and you know
[11:35] Zeus is uniquely positioned because we
[11:37] have this um you know incentive to move
[11:41] you on to self-custody right
[11:44] um you know we're not running any of the
[11:46] mints we're just letting third parties
[11:48] run that the user selects their own
[11:49] mints um but we have the lightning
[11:52] service provider and we connect people
[11:53] with those self-custodial lightning
[11:55] channels. So, we sort of have this
[11:57] incentive to educate the users, prod
[11:59] them. Um, you know, maybe there are
[12:03] cases in which like there's regulatory
[12:05] concerns that some of these wallets
[12:07] might have be like, oh, we're going we
[12:08] want to wind down the custodial part.
[12:11] Um, we'll push you out the door. But
[12:13] like financially, most of these other
[12:16] services are collecting
[12:19] fees like for each transaction that goes
[12:22] through their node. They probably want
[12:24] to keep you in there as long as
[12:25] possible. Zeus has the complete opposite
[12:28] outlook. Our incentives are, you know,
[12:29] push custody. uh have you pay for the
[12:32] channels on the LSP or even if you don't
[12:34] go that route, you still have the
[12:36] freedom to,
[12:38] you know, open up your own channels and
[12:40] go self-custodial in however form you
[12:43] want if you want to be hands-on and get
[12:45] all that crazy granular control we give
[12:47] you. Or, you know, you could even just
[12:50] swap out. Like, you don't have to be
[12:52] using self-custodial lightning
[12:53] necessarily, even though it's my
[12:55] preferred way to go. You might just want
[12:56] to be someone who's like, "Okay, I'm
[12:58] going to build up this cashew balance.
[13:00] I'm willing to incur a little more risk.
[13:02] I'll go up to 100,000 sats and then
[13:05] I'll just swap out and I'll go onchain
[13:07] on my hardware wallet or whatever. And
[13:10] that's an option too. And you know
[13:13] really the thing with Seuss that you
[13:18] know we're rooted in self-custody like
[13:21] that's how we started the app. you know,
[13:22] being that cipher punk, connect to your
[13:25] node remotely,
[13:27] but we also realize that people are
[13:29] going to use Bitcoin a whole lot of
[13:31] different ways.
[13:33] And if we're going to get angry or like
[13:35] moralized or look down upon people, like
[13:38] that's not the right way to go. I think
[13:40] it's better to sort of meet people where
[13:42] they're at and then give them the
[13:45] resources,
[13:46] the education so they can make their
[13:49] informed decisions. And then you sort of
[13:51] have this crazy user experience where
[13:53] like you just can be the place where you
[13:57] start your Bitcoin journey not knowing
[13:58] anything and then you you level up as
[14:01] you go. You can go to the node in the
[14:03] phone. You could become a remote node
[14:05] runner.
[14:07] It's sort of like an all-in-one
[14:08] experience now and we're sort of like
[14:10] your Bitcoin Sherpa guiding you as you
[14:14] go along and I think that's super
[14:16] unique. I I like the sherpa analogy
[14:19] there and I I think it's really
[14:21] important what you said about meeting
[14:22] people where they are. It's like you you
[14:24] need to meet people where they are, not
[14:26] where you want them to be, not where you
[14:27] ideally believe they should be, not
[14:30] where like you think that they must be
[14:31] or they're completely lars because most
[14:34] people like don't actually care about
[14:36] that and that doesn't actually help
[14:37] adoption. Like, but if you can meet them
[14:39] where they are right now, addressing the
[14:42] needs that they have at the moment, then
[14:44] they're going to actually use your
[14:45] product and then they like like all of
[14:47] us did like maybe there are some people
[14:50] who heard about Bitcoin and immediately
[14:52] went all the way down that rabbit hole
[14:54] wherever it ends. I was not one of them.
[14:56] I for I think for most people it's a
[14:59] journey, right? It's a journey down that
[15:01] rabbit hole. It's a journey of going
[15:02] deeper and deeper, understanding more,
[15:04] being comfortable with more. Like I
[15:06] remember setting up my first uh first
[15:08] time I set up a a node and and a
[15:10] lightning node. I did the whole Raspi
[15:12] blitz thing. Um had no idea what I was
[15:14] doing, you know, was going around on
[15:16] various forums figuring stuff out like,
[15:18] you know, but got like got it to work
[15:20] and like that was really fun and it
[15:22] taught me a lot about it.
 Most people
[15:24] aren't going to most people aren't going
[15:26] to do that though.
 Yeah, of course. A
[15:27] lot of people still may have a desire to
[15:29] have something in the middle that still
[15:31] gives them some of the same benefits of
[15:33] of having something that they're running
[15:34] themselves, but without a lot of those
[15:37] setup hurdles, let's say. And actually,
[15:39] I want to uh I I want to kind of dive in
[15:41] a little bit to the uh the eCash part of
[15:44] this cuz correct me if I'm wrong, you
[15:46] were not always the biggest ecash fan,
[15:49] correct?
 Yes, I'm still not. Well, yes
[15:51] and no. Right.
 So, talk to me about
[15:53] that. What what what changed your mind
[15:55] where you brought this into to Zeus?
[15:58] Well, I I think it's multiple things,
[16:00] right? Like you know, I've had such a
[16:02] funny history with it and
[16:05] you know, um I I've always like worn my
[16:09] heart on my sleeve, but you know, I'll
[16:11] also be the first to admit that, you
[16:13] know, my opinions have changed over the
[16:16] years. I don't think it's so crazy to
[16:19] get new info and
[16:22] evolve and grow, right? But yeah, I'll
[16:24] be the first to admit like I'm I'm the
[16:26] told Kie to his face, so I think he
[16:29] cashes [ __ ] you know, and had like
[16:32] uh giant tirades against it. Um but at
[16:36] the same time, I I I can still see the
[16:38] immense value in it. Um,
[16:42] I I think it's in the online age like
[16:45] it's very easy to try to put things in a
[16:48] box and paint things as black or or
[16:50] white, but you know, reality is not like
[16:52] that at all. There's so much nuance and
[16:55] layers to it. Um,
[16:58] obviously
[17:00] if
[17:02] the whole world is just using cashew
[17:05] mints, that wouldn't be the ideal world,
[17:08] right? Ideally, we'd get to a point
[17:09] where people can use Bitcoin
[17:10] self-custodially and hold their own keys
[17:12] and they can't get rubbed, right? Um, at
[17:15] the same time,
[17:18] if the whole world was using Bitcoin
[17:20] ecash, that's would still be pretty
[17:23] sweet compared to where we are now. be a
[17:25] much better alternative to the fiat bank
[17:27] system as it exists today and would be
[17:30] way way way better than the dystopian
[17:34] um potential futures we have with these
[17:36] CBDs or CBDC. Sorry.
[17:41] Yeah. Um yeah, CBD is not too dystopian.
[17:44] No, I I just to to jump in there for
[17:47] anybody who is like perhaps uh still
[17:49] confused about uh about Cashew and maybe
[17:51] we can go into some of the high level,
[17:53] but like there's a bunch of other things
[17:54] I want to get into with you here today.
[17:56] I did do a full like 90 plus minute deep
[18:00] dive with Cali on eCash. So, if you guys
[18:02] for anyone that is like still confused
[18:04] about that and like wants to go back and
[18:06] kind of dig into that really deeply and
[18:08] figure out exactly what's going on
[18:09] there, check it out. Also, you what
[18:11] you'll hear that Calli himself says is
[18:13] look, this is like you can get rugged
[18:16] that this is not rug free. This is not a
[18:18] risk-free thing.
 Right. Right.
 But
[18:20] again, it's like it's serving a purpose.
[18:22] It's it's not supposed to be layer 1
[18:24] Bitcoin or to compete with layer 1
[18:26] Bitcoin, but it's building a really
[18:27] great tool that leverages Bitcoin as
[18:31] money, but doesn't have all of the
[18:34] benefits of layer 1 Bitcoin because of
[18:36] course there's trade-offs as you go down
[18:38] in layers, right? absolutely everywhere.
[18:40] There's no perfect solutions in
[18:42] engineering at all. You know, you just
[18:44] have trade-offs and you sort of just got
[18:46] to figure out what tool best suits the
[18:49] job. And instead of moralizing about
[18:53] saying, "Oh, everyone should be using a
[18:54] hammer." Um, you know, you should figure
[18:57] out what everyone's trying to do and
[18:59] where they're at. And we could say,
[19:00] "Hey, the hammer's really great. You
[19:02] might want to use this for um for
[19:05] hitting nails, putting some wood
[19:06] together."
[19:08] Um, you got to understand that, you
[19:09] know, maybe people aren't ready for it
[19:11] right away. Um, not to just like give up
[19:16] and say, "Oh,
[19:18] this person's never going to use a
[19:19] hammer." Like, just not now, you know?
[19:20] Just slow your time horizon and give
[19:24] people time to to justade and give them
[19:27] resources and give them encouragement
[19:29] and and try to explain why these tools
[19:32] are important and why they should
[19:34] consider going down this path. Um, and I
[19:37] think, you know, it's just
[19:39] so much easier to go online and say,
[19:40] "Hey, you're an idiot. You're not using
[19:43] Bitcoin like me. You're not holding your
[19:44] own keys. You're uh not self-custodying
[19:47] yet." Um, yeah, probably some of those
[19:50] labels are okay to throw at someone when
[19:53] they're putting, you know, serious
[19:55] amounts of their wealth relative uh to
[19:58] their net worth into these systems. Um,
[20:02] but, you know, people are going to do
[20:04] stupid things anyway. the best you can
[20:05] do is educate them, show them the way,
[20:10] you know, it's like you attract more
[20:11] flies with honey sort of thing. And
[20:16] I think if we just if Bitcoin stays
[20:18] where it's at with the small community
[20:20] it has and it's just used as it is now,
[20:25] you know, store value ETFs,
[20:29] rock under the bed, shiny rock under the
[20:32] bed, gold 2.0, like I'll consider a
[20:34] colossal failure. Uh so we need to build
[20:36] out these circular economies and make
[20:38] sure Bitcoin gets used for commerce
[20:40] everywhere. And if you expect people to
[20:43] just go in full throttle, you know, uh
[20:46] run your own lightning node, uh do it
[20:49] all privately, self-hosted,
[20:51] self-custodial,
[20:53] spit out coin joins, go to cold storage
[20:56] on day one, then you're diluted. Um, but
[20:59] at the same time,
[21:03] this technology and or at least the base
[21:05] knowledge of it, cursory knowledge of it
[21:07] is becoming ubiquitous. It's everywhere.
[21:09] And the average person on the street
[21:12] sees that it's not going away. They're
[21:14] seeing that these articles that have
[21:16] been written about Bitcoin dying or just
[21:18] being for drug money or scams that
[21:20] they're seeing that that's all fake and
[21:23] that there's something to this. It has
[21:24] staying power. more people are adopting
[21:26] it as we see I mean just the last couple
[21:30] of months stake and shake it's big
[21:32] chains that have 400 branches plus when
[21:35] you hear stories that square is finally
[21:38] gearing up to turn it on by default on
[21:41] their what their 4 million terminals and
[21:43] I think that's going to include web
[21:45] checkouts too um and then just like
[21:49] anecdotally from what we're seeing in
[21:50] terms of uh usage from both the like
[21:54] consumer level, like the app level, but
[21:56] also businesses calling us up and
[22:01] asking like, "Hey, how how do I do
[22:03] this?" Like, "I saw um Steak and Shake
[22:07] doing this and I see you guys are doing
[22:10] something similar or I saw, you know, a
[22:12] Zeus user paying to terms. Can you help
[22:13] us set up?" Or I saw
[22:16] um payments at Pub Key and I saw you
[22:20] guys were running the payments for them.
[22:22] Um, we're having a lot of really
[22:25] interesting conversations right now and
[22:27] I'm hoping, you know, we can make some
[22:29] some more announcements uh in the coming
[22:32] weeks and months about some of the
[22:34] people we're on boarding right now. Uh,
[22:37] obviously there's a lot of work to do
[22:38] and you know things are still very nent
[22:41] and we have a long way to go both as a
[22:44] company at Zeus,
[22:47] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange,
[22:50] the whole thing growing. Um, but it
[22:52] feels like we're making some real
[22:53] strides right now and it's really
[22:54] exciting.
[22:56] It's a it's a great time to to be
[22:58] involved and feels nice to help push the
[23:01] needle a little bit.
 If you're stuck
[23:04] spending dollars, at least stop earning
[23:06] dirty fiat rewards. Use Fold to earn
[23:10] Bitcoin on everyday purchases and
[23:12] regular expenses like groceries, bills,
[23:15] travel, home improvement. I literally
[23:17] just earned 2,23
[23:19] sats buying a $100 Amazon gift card on
[23:23] Fold. You don't even need to use the
[23:25] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[23:27] You can connect your favorite credit
[23:29] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[23:31] on merchant offers or go allin. Make
[23:35] Fold the center of your personal
[23:37] finances. Buy, earn, save, and even get
[23:40] paid in Bitcoin with Fold. Head to the
[23:43] link in the show notes to get started
[23:45] with the ultimate savings toolkit or go
[23:48] directly to use.foldapp.com/r/walker
[23:53] and get yourself $10 in Bitcoin when you
[23:56] sign up. If you've accepted that we're
[23:58] living through the fourth turning, then
[24:00] it's time to get yourself some Bitcoin
[24:02] and then go to bitbox.swiss/walker
[24:04] Swiss/walker and use the promo code
[24:07] Walker for 5% off the easy to use, fully
[24:10] open-source Bitcoin only Bitbox 2
[24:13] hardware wallet. Then get your Bitcoin
[24:14] off the exchange into your own
[24:16] self-custody and prepare yourself for
[24:18] the chaos that is to come. The world is
[24:20] going pretty wild right now, but Bitcoin
[24:23] is ripping and your stack will soon be
[24:25] worth a heck of a lot more in fiat value
[24:27] than it is today as every currency
[24:28] around the world hyperinflates. So now
[24:31] is the perfect time to get your security
[24:33] locked down tight with Bitbox. I really
[24:35] want to emphasize that the Bitbox O2 is
[24:37] easy as hell to use. Whether you're
[24:38] brand new to Bitcoin, it's your first
[24:39] time setting up a hardware wallet, or
[24:41] you are a well seasoned psychopath, it
[24:43] is Bitcoin only and fully open source.
[24:46] No need to trust me. You can head to
[24:48] their GitHub and verify that for
[24:50] yourself. When you go to
[24:51] bitbox.swiss/walker
[24:54] and use the promo code Walker, not only
[24:56] do you get 5% off, but you also help
[24:58] support this podcast. So, thank you.
[25:02] No doubt. And I'm I'm curious, too. I
[25:03] mean, do you think
[25:06] because I' I've seen this debated and
[25:07] it's something that I debate about uh
[25:08] with my myself occasionally, but I mean,
[25:11] do you think Bitcoin is at this point
[25:13] mainstream uh in terms of at least it's
[25:17] uh that people know about it? Because
[25:20] I've seen, you know, back and forth on
[25:21] this like if you see some of like Joe
[25:22] Nakamoto, who shout out to Joe, he does
[25:24] incredible work. Uh if you see some of
[25:27] his videos like where he does man on the
[25:29] street type stuff and goes up and just
[25:30] talks to random people. It's like
[25:32] there's still so many people who
[25:33] literally he says Bitcoin to them and
[25:34] they're like what is that? I've I've
[25:36] literally never heard that word before
[25:37] in my life. And I'm like how have you
[25:39] never heard that word? Like, but you
[25:41] realize like from an adoption
[25:44] standpoint, we're objectively still
[25:46] early in terms of like we're at probably
[25:48] less like a fraction of a percent of the
[25:51] world that actually owns Bitcoin in some
[25:55] some way. Maybe with the ETFs that's
[25:58] changed a little bit, but it's still a
[26:00] pretty small amount of people who at
[26:02] least know they have exposure to
[26:04] Bitcoin. Maybe there's others that have
[26:05] exposure that don't know about it yet. I
[26:07] don't know. But like
 that's going to
[26:08] change too with like
 Yeah. and stuff.
[26:10] But
 where do you think we're at in that
[26:13] though? Like because to me it still
[26:15] feels very early. And I think it's great
[26:17] that these tools are being uh that these
[26:19] tools are being built so that when
[26:20] people do decide to actually pay
[26:22] attention to Bitcoin, they have more
[26:24] options available to them than just
[26:26] okay, I'm going to go buy the Bitcoin a
[26:28] Bitcoin ETF, which is you want to do
[26:30] that, that's fine. Like, but
 yeah, it's
[26:32] it's like it's such in such an
[26:34] interesting spot right now, right?
[26:36] Because I feel like at least anecdotally
[26:40] like my experience like you'll say the
[26:42] word Bitcoin
[26:44] to the average person they at least have
[26:46] like heard of it they're like uh some
[26:48] internet money digital money
[26:51] what they think of it you know has
[26:54] probably range wildly most people have
[26:57] like talk about like risk aversion oh I
[27:01] heard from you know financial person I
[27:04] shouldn't invest in it or I shouldn't
[27:06] invest more than I'm willing to lose in
[27:08] it. Like that that's probably the
[27:09] general sentiment. So it's like where
[27:12] are we in this adoption curve? And you
[27:14] can't really draw too many parallels to
[27:17] to other technologies.
[27:19] I think like looking back
[27:22] like email would probably be an
[27:25] interesting one. like we're in the phase
[27:27] where people have all maybe heard of it
[27:29] because of articles written in
[27:33] you know um the news magazines and
[27:37] whatnot. It's like oh the mail is in the
[27:39] computer but people haven't done it yet.
[27:41] They haven't gotten their um they
[27:44] haven't gotten internet in their home
[27:45] yet you know like that's sort of where
[27:47] we're at. Uh I think there might also be
[27:50] a lot of interesting parallels to like
[27:52] file sharing. Um, you know, some people
[27:57] are there, they might be using Napster,
[28:00] but it's really just the more hardcore
[28:03] people that have been exposed to it.
[28:05] But, you know, um,
[28:08] we still really haven't had our like
[28:12] Spotify moment or Apple iTunes moment
[28:15] yet. Not really. I mean, there are some
[28:18] big players in right now, but
[28:23] adoption like usage really isn't that
[28:26] widespread yet.
[28:28] And I think like the reason you can't
[28:30] really
[28:33] like draw parallels to either of these
[28:35] technologies onetoone
[28:37] is that when money is involved, stakes
[28:40] are higher and people are going to be
[28:41] more riskaverse, right?
[28:43] uh it's much less risky to uh send an
[28:48] email, for example. There's like no
[28:50] almost no risk there. Uh with file
[28:52] sharing, uh it's a little risk. Maybe
[28:54] you're worried about getting caught by
[28:56] uh you know, the cops getting a letter
[28:58] from your ISP or whatever, getting sued
[29:01] like, uh like what Metallica did. Um
[29:05] but with money, I think most people jump
[29:08] in there and be like, "Oh no, I can't I
[29:10] can't afford this. I can't take this
[29:12] risk. I I don't have the budget for it.
[29:15] I'm just trying to make ends of meet.
[29:17] And you know,
[29:20] people don't realize that they can
[29:22] receive like less than a cent of Bitcoin
[29:26] on the lightning network or with a
[29:28] cashew token and that the don't have to
[29:31] just dive in with your whole life
[29:33] savings like a lot of us have. Um
[29:37] so yeah, it's it's interesting. Um,
[29:41] but yeah, it's it's really going to take
[29:43] more time. And and the other interesting
[29:45] parallels that it's like completely
[29:47] unique, it's not like when email was out
[29:50] that all these email like things and
[29:53] scams were like forcing people out, you
[29:56] know,
 like say like, uh, oh, I got
[30:00] malware from Kazah or whatever. Like,
[30:02] no. Like there is so much damn noise
[30:06] with crypto and these scams and FTX and
[30:09] every cycle and it's going to just keep
[30:11] repeating and repeating and repeating
[30:12] and you know that that distinction um is
[30:16] really tough to make and takes time and
[30:19] education and all these other efforts
[30:20] and and really it takes people like
[30:22] actually trying and getting a better
[30:25] grasp of the technology themselves and
[30:27] like at least understanding like you
[30:30] know the properties of it Obviously,
[30:34] the average person doesn't know how
[30:36] email works and how it gets from one
[30:39] inbox to another. Similarly, they're not
[30:42] going to know how Bitcoin works or how
[30:44] it goes from the blockchain all the way
[30:46] up to the cash min or something like
[30:49] that. But at the same time, people are
[30:51] still going to use it. People are using
[30:52] it today. And um yeah, it's just going
[30:57] to be a long haul. you we got to be in
[30:59] it um for the long haul. Understand that
[31:02] things are changing in this industry
[31:05] incredibly rapidly even though adoption
[31:08] takes a really long time. Um, and
[31:14] you know, it's sort of funny at how it's
[31:17] at odds with how things sort of work in
[31:20] the fiat economy with VC money and all
[31:25] these hype cycles and trying to take
[31:27] people's attention away. It's it's
[31:30] really at odds with each other. And
[31:32] really the people who are going to
[31:34] succeed are going to be the ones who
[31:35] can, you know, stay alive and be in it
[31:41] for the long haul and also be adaptable,
[31:45] you know. um sort of meet people where
[31:48] they're at and actually listen to
[31:52] what people need and and expect and what
[31:56] their problems are
[31:58] and not just say, "Oh,
[32:01] yeah, the problem is central banking.
[32:03] The problem is your your wealth is being
[32:04] ded away." The problem is you're in a
[32:07] hamster wheel and you're barely making
[32:10] ends meet and you're living paycheck to
[32:11] paycheck. And yeah, of course that's
[32:13] really the problem for most people. Um,
[32:18] but it's also like a bitter
[32:22] pill to swallow and it could be
[32:23] overwhelming and and people might not be
[32:27] looking
[32:29] at their lives at at that level and
[32:33] probably have a lot of distractions
[32:34] going on. you know, it's really just
[32:37] it's really a big uphill battle in a lot
[32:40] of ways trying to orange pill someone
[32:42] and and I know
[32:45] many of the Bitcoin most of the
[32:47] Bitcoiners I've talked to and hang out
[32:48] with like they've given up on that.
[32:51] Like I feel like everyone goes through
[32:53] this period when they first learn about
[32:54] it, they're like, "Oh my god, this
[32:57] technology is amazing. It's empowering.
[33:00] It can break me out of my nine-to-five
[33:04] shackles, my debt shackles, societal
[33:07] expectations,
[33:09] uh my the fruits of my labor not being
[33:11] stolen from me in this indirect
[33:15] taxation. Um and you know, as you
[33:19] extrapolate, you're like, "Oh, this
[33:20] could potentially have geopolitical
[33:22] impacts. This could change the whole
[33:24] [ __ ] world." And you want to go tell
[33:26] everyone. You get so excited. You're
[33:27] like, "Have you heard about Bitcoin
[33:28] yet?" and you just become that annoying
[33:31] guy and everyone's like, "Shut the [ __ ]
[33:32] up, dude." Every conversation you try to
[33:34] inject this and uh you know, most people
[33:38] don't care. They're like,
[33:40] "Did you watch the game last night?"
[33:42] Yeah. Catch that game last night, bro.
[33:44] Yeah. And you know, it's like nothing
[33:46] against sports. I love sports. Um but uh
[33:50] you know, people are have all these
[33:51] distractions that they're more worried
[33:53] about. And uh
[33:56] then it's sort of like a double-edged
[33:58] sword, too. Like, okay, like let's say
[33:59] you get someone in
[34:01] um at the top of a cycle and they're
[34:03] like, "Fucking Evan, that son of a
[34:05] [ __ ] You recommended Bitcoin to me and
[34:07] now it's down 30%." And what you're
[34:10] going to say like, "Oh, you got to lower
[34:11] your time preference. You just got to
[34:13] wait. Just hold it for two years. You're
[34:15] going to be back up two years. Two years
[34:17] is a millennia for these people."
[34:20] The other side of the coin is Oh [ __ ]
[34:23] Look, Evan invested in Bitcoin so early.
[34:25] That's a lucky son of a [ __ ] And um
[34:30] this, you know, they're jealous. They
[34:33] they might not say it directly. Um
[34:37] and you know, in that regard, people
[34:40] become
[34:43] averse to like trying to to orange pill
[34:45] people. They have all these bad
[34:46] experiences. And I think as a result,
[34:49] people just
[34:51] have sort of resigned and been like,
[34:52] "Okay, you know what? I'm not really
[34:54] going to be too vocal about it." Um, but
[34:59] instead, we'll let people come to them,
[35:01] which is probably a better way to go
[35:03] about it.
 Dude, you've literally just
[35:05] described my entire journey. Like,
[35:07] exactly, though. Like, like literally so
[35:09] gung-ho at first hearing about it. And
[35:11] you're right, cuz it's like you're so
[35:13] excited about it and things are clicking
[35:14] for you and so you're like, I need to
[35:16] share this with the people I care about.
[35:18] I need to share with my family. I need
[35:20] to share it with my friends. I need to
[35:21] share it with the the lady cutting my
[35:23] hair and like, you know, the like, you
[35:25] know, I need to share it with everyone.
[35:27] And then like part of it is like maybe
[35:29] you get you get like rejected enough
[35:31] times or like you said, okay, you told
[35:34] tell somebody to get in at the at the
[35:36] current top, you know, which is not
[35:38] going to be the top. it's going to be
[35:39] somewhere in the middle like four years
[35:41] from there but like right you know if
[35:42] somebody got in right at the top you
[35:44] look like a you know a jackass to them
[35:46] like and you're like oh [ __ ] okay and
[35:47] then eventually you're just kind of like
[35:48] okay you know yeah come my way like you
[35:52] know you want to do your best to get
[35:53] your family and your like closest
[35:55] friends on board and like what I've
[35:58] realized it's like a good way of doing
[36:00] this is like look you know I care about
[36:02] you hopefully you think that you don't
[36:04] think that I'm like a lunatic I'm
[36:06] literally telling you this because I
[36:08] love you and I want you to be able to
[36:10] experience this. You can turn it down if
[36:12] you want, but like you can't say that to
[36:14] like a random person or like a not such
[36:16] a close friend cuz if you start telling
[36:17] everybody like you love them, it just
[36:18] gets a little weird.
 But so like there's
[36:21] there's a there's a limit to how much
[36:22] that works to how big that circle can
[36:24] spread. But
 Mhm.
 But but it's tough.
[36:27] Well, and this is why I love like what
[36:29] you're building though because it's like
[36:31] yeah, not every like you everybody may
[36:34] try to orange pill their friends and
[36:36] that spreads slowly, but like ultimately
[36:38] people come when they're ready like
[36:39] right like we get Bitcoin at the price
[36:41] we deserve. Uh we start understanding it
[36:44] at the price we deserve and once you do
[36:46] start understanding it like it's pretty
[36:49] amazing when there's great tools that
[36:50] already exist where you can go, "Oh,
[36:53] wow. This is like this is easy. This
[36:55] doesn't feel as scary as I thought it
[36:57] was when you know my friend Walker was
[36:59] ranting about magic internet money like
[37:01] that. He made he he made it sound way
[37:03] too complicated that ass. But like so so
[37:05] that's like you need those tools in
[37:08] place because people are coming. It's
[37:10] just it's not a question of if it's just
[37:12] a question of when.
 It's happening. It's
[37:14] crazy.
 Yeah, it's happening. It's
[37:15] happening. I I am I am curious.
 Even the
[37:17] boomers, man. Even the boomers are
[37:19] coming. I'm telling you. I I dunk I dunk
[37:21] on boomers a lot, but I hope the boomers
[37:23] that I know listen to the show and my
[37:24] friends, dear friends who are boomers
[37:26] know that I'm not talking about them
[37:28] specifically. I'm talking broadly like
[37:30] when boomers say and I'm again broadly
[37:32] boomers say like, "Well, you
[37:33] millennials, if you just didn't eat your
[37:35] avocado toast and, you know, pick
[37:37] yourself up by your bootstraps, maybe
[37:38] you too could buy a house for four
[37:40] raspberries like I did in 1971." And you
[37:43] know, so shout out to shout out to the
[37:45] boomers. I love you even though you are
[37:46] the butt of some jokes. uh you know who
[37:48] you are and I appreciate you.
 Yeah. They
[37:51] don't just they just don't know how good
[37:52] they had it. It's like okay, yeah, maybe
[37:54] we have our cheap avocado toast relative
[37:56] to you guys, but you guys had all the
[37:59] assets that anyone wants. So much
[38:01] cheaper housing. Um you know, just cost
[38:04] of living in general. Um
[38:08] it's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. But
[38:10] you know, I I think boomers are at least
[38:14] seeing that this thing has staying
[38:16] power. It's been around a long time. Uh
[38:20] we can't ban it. You can't stop it. It's
[38:23] not a scam. Um people are improving
[38:26] their lives over it. They are
[38:28] integrating it into their businesses.
[38:31] And you know, I I feel like they've seen
[38:34] it time and time again in their lives.
[38:36] It's like at some point you need to um
[38:40] get a website for your business, right?
[38:43] You need to get on social media and
[38:46] use that to to grow your business and
[38:48] reach out to more customers. And
[38:50] eventually it's going to become you got
[38:52] to accept Bitcoin at your business. You
[38:56] should really have a Bitcoin treasury,
[38:58] too. And that's sort of a funny
[39:00] distinction that we're having with some
[39:01] of the boomers that we're talking about
[39:03] and on boarding. They're like, "Oh,
[39:05] yeah. You know, I see the the
[39:06] volatility. You know, Evan, you sent me
[39:08] uh
[39:10] he sent me a thousand sets. uh you know
[39:13] it was a little bit over a dollar now
[39:15] it's a little bit under a dollar what's
[39:17] going on I want to get rid of this as
[39:18] soon as possible and it's like okay okay
[39:19] okay you know they don't have to dive in
[39:23] all the way but really you know you got
[39:25] to plant those seeds like you should
[39:27] probably think about holding this it's
[39:28] like uh this probably won't be a huge
[39:30] amount of your sales right out the gate
[39:34] maybe you should just hold that part if
[39:36] you can right and you know obviously
[39:40] it's your money you're free to do
[39:41] whatever you on will even help you
[39:43] convert it. Um,
[39:46] but it might make sense to hold on to it
[39:49] maybe. So, you know, like I said, people
[39:53] are in different stages of their
[39:55] journeys. They make these realizations
[39:57] at different points. They're going to
[39:58] use it differently. Everyone's life
[40:00] situation is different. Every business
[40:02] has different requirements and needs and
[40:05] clientele and costs and XYZ.
[40:10] And you know, we're seeing them like
[40:14] just cultlike behavior by so many people
[40:17] that it's like subsections of our
[40:19] community where like everyone's got to
[40:21] do this, everyone's got to use it the
[40:22] same way, everyone's got to be
[40:23] self-custodial, or everyone should just
[40:25] use,
[40:27] you know, this custody app. It's so
[40:30] easy. or or everyone should run core,
[40:33] everyone should run N. It's like no,
[40:36] dude. Do what makes sense for you. Um,
[40:39] and
[40:41] here's some reasons why X, Y, or Z might
[40:44] make sense to you. I don't know. It's
[40:47] just just a it's just so easy to just
[40:48] get into your
[40:52] corner and be like, "Okay, these are my
[40:54] people, right? This is how I do. This is
[40:57] who I'm going to defer to for my
[40:59] thinking."
[41:00] um you know if if some if this person
[41:03] likes this then it can't be good. It's
[41:05] like it's like where's the critical
[41:09] thinking of some people? It's it's
[41:11] pretty scary. And you know
[41:14] you know I I feel like this is also like
[41:17] another side effect of the internet age.
[41:19] It's like people think that they can't
[41:22] have disagreements with people that
[41:24] they're friends with or or they love.
[41:26] like
[41:28] I'm not going to gonna hang out with
[41:30] them cuz they're they're a lib or
[41:32] they're a magard or whatever. It's like
[41:37] sort of a sad way to to live your life,
[41:40] you know, and and you know, same thing
[41:42] with Bitcoin. It's like, okay, like
[41:45] you're into Bitcoin, you like Bitcoin,
[41:47] you that's great. That doesn't mean that
[41:49] you know, we're best friends or we're or
[41:51] that we're sympaticos. It's like it's
[41:54] it's also just a tool, you know? It's
[41:57] like, "Oh, dude, you use email, too."
[41:59] Oh, man. We're bros.
[42:02] You got a Twitter account. That's sweet,
[42:04] dude.
[42:07] So,
 hey, that said, being a Bitcoiner,
[42:10] at least at this stage we're at now, I
[42:13] found, can be a good filter for finding
[42:15] some good people. Now, there's still
[42:16] plenty of shitty plenty of shitty people
[42:18] who have Bitcoin. There's shitty people
[42:20] everywhere. But like at least at the
[42:23] eariness uh early or this stage of
[42:26] eariness we're at now, it it can be a
[42:29] cool filter uh for for finding people
[42:31] that are at least
[42:33] uh roughly ideologically aligned. U
[42:36] Right. Right. Most most people that got
[42:38] here
[42:40] got here for a reason.
 Yeah.
[42:44] But you know there are outliers.
 So but
[42:47] no, you're right. You're right. to where
[42:48] we are in the adoption curve, it is a
[42:49] really good filter and and most of the
[42:51] people that
[42:53] we have come out to the meetups that we
[42:55] do out here, you know, generally really
[42:58] great people. I'm sure there's like a
[42:59] spook or two in the middle. I think
[43:02] there's always a spook or two. Like it
[43:04] would be crazy if there I mean the CIA
[43:06] invented Bitcoin after all, so you know,
[43:08] of course there there's got to be a
[43:10] spook or two there. They got to check on
[43:12] how their little their little project's
[43:13] doing, right?
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[43:16] who knows really? I don't try to know,
[43:19] but you know, if you look at,
 you know,
[43:22] deception of the internet, all these
[43:23] other, you know, pieces of encryption,
[43:27] um
[43:29] even even apps like Signal, how how
[43:31] they've been funded. Um
[43:35] you know, it's ubiquitous. It's just how
[43:37] society's really organized itself and
[43:40] state has really grown to such a crazy
[43:43] level and especially in the last 100
[43:45] years let's say. Um
[43:48] yeah, it's it's just makes sense that
[43:52] and just thinking about the stakes, of
[43:54] course, these people are going to be
[43:57] embedded everywhere and uh yeah, it sort
[44:00] of makes
[44:02] operating as a Bitcoiner uh a little
[44:05] tricky, a little dicey. Well, I I wanted
[44:07] to ask you about this because like okay,
[44:10] obviously the last administration in the
[44:12] US was
[44:13] uh exponentially less friendly and was
[44:16] trying to make life hell and has you
[44:18] know been prosecuting or was prosecuting
[44:21] uh various open-source developers.
[44:24] Where are you at right now with your
[44:25] level of comfortability running a a
[44:29] Bitcoin business and building awesome
[44:32] freedom tech for people? Like are I mean
[44:37] are are you always just one
[44:39] administration away from like okay I
[44:41] gotta like shut this down and go
[44:44] somewhere else or like
 how how do you
[44:46] think about cuz like it can change it
[44:48] can change every four years
 a drop of a
[44:49] dime you know.
 Yeah.
 Like if the state
[44:54] doesn't like what you're doing
[44:57] they could basically stop you. like the
[44:59] the state by itself can always crush any
[45:04] single individual
[45:07] but
[45:09] if the actions are taken on by a group
[45:11] and it's a distributed thing it's
[45:14] multiple efforts it becomes cultural um
[45:17] and it's not just
[45:20] you know one small group or or one
[45:22] individual then you know then things
[45:25] become inevitable and and they become
[45:26] unstoppable
[45:28] And
[45:31] I think,
[45:33] you know, we we just got to keep leaning
[45:35] into that and and, you know, not to be
[45:37] like an uber collectivist.
[45:40] I mean, that's already been an
[45:41] interesting talk uh theme in our talk so
[45:44] far, but you know, really Bitcoin needs
[45:49] everyone. Bitcoin needs you. And
[45:54] it success is not inevitable. And the
[45:57] more that individuals act, we act
[46:00] collectively in pushing this technology,
[46:03] then the higher chance it is to succeed
[46:05] and the harder it is for the state to
[46:07] snuff it out. Um,
[46:09] so where's my comfort level right now
[46:12] building this technology?
[46:14] Um, it's not 100%.
[46:17] Right now it's way better than it was um
[46:21] the last couple years.
[46:23] Um, that being said, we still have a
[46:26] long way to go. A lot of our friends are
[46:28] still
[46:30] being prosecuted, right? The tornado
[46:32] cash guys are still in court. The
[46:35] samurai wallet devs are still in court.
[46:39] uh not all states or countries have the
[46:42] same asurances about self-custody or
[46:46] mining or
[46:50] you know these L2 services that we're
[46:53] running and you know like I said like
[46:57] these things could change at the drop of
[46:59] a hat maybe even this administration
[47:01] changes their tune and you know if you
[47:04] look at the geopolitical climate a lot
[47:07] of that stuff could be use as an excuse
[47:10] to
[47:12] back down on us. So, you know, my
[47:15] message to all the builders out there,
[47:17] to the people pushing the software, is
[47:18] like,
[47:21] you know, um when we're given an inch,
[47:23] let's take a mile. Let's keep pressing
[47:25] forward. While we have the runway, let's
[47:27] use it.
[47:29] I personally think that we're going to
[47:32] win a lot of battles over the next four
[47:35] years, the duration of this admin,
[47:37] right? Um,
[47:40] we're going to still lose some,
[47:43] but we certainly have more runway and
[47:45] leeway than we previously did. So, let's
[47:48] build, let's build, let's build, let's
[47:50] ship, let's keep pushing stuff in the
[47:52] right direction. And
[47:56] we need to get this tech to a point
[47:58] where it's proliferated so much that
[48:01] it's not socially acceptable to put the
[48:04] clamps down on the technology, the
[48:07] users, the developers.
[48:11] So, still
[48:14] a lot of fighting to do.
[48:17] We should expect things to get worse
[48:19] before they get better. But we can also
[48:25] tell ourselves and and accept like
[48:27] things are definitely better than where
[48:31] they were like, you know, two years ago.
[48:33] And when Samurai was just getting
[48:36] arrested and
[48:38] while a Satoshi and Phoenix wallet
[48:40] leaving the United States, like
[48:43] I'm not going to lie to you, that was
[48:44] scary.
[48:46] Really scary. Um
[48:52] and to think that that's the worst of
[48:54] it. I mean hopefully it is.
[48:56] Um
[48:59] and obviously you know geopolitically
[49:01] like the whole world is different.
[49:02] Different countries are going to do
[49:03] crackdown more other some countries have
[49:05] more to lose than others. Um,
[49:10] but yeah, we just got to be resilient
[49:13] and
[49:17] know that that's
[49:19] likely not the worst of it. We have a
[49:22] lot of bigger battles ahead of us to
[49:23] fight. I mean,
[49:26] what happens if
[49:29] hyperinflation really hits some of these
[49:30] Western countries?
[49:33] We're definitely prime scapegoats.
[49:38] But again, it's about education. It's
[49:40] like, no, you guys are the [ __ ] who
[49:43] put us 30, 40, 50 trillion dollars in
[49:46] debt. It wasn't us who wanted to
[49:48] recklessly spend. It wasn't us who
[49:50] wanted to
[49:51] give money to foreign countries when we
[49:54] have veterans starving at home.
[49:58] Um,
[50:00] and you know, at some point
[50:04] the existing system is going to topple
[50:07] in on itself and there's going to be
[50:09] there's going to have to be a new
[50:10] restructuring. I think again it's like
[50:13] not going to happen this year, next
[50:16] year, probably not even during this
[50:18] administration. I think, you know, I
[50:21] think in the next 20 years though,
[50:22] there's going to be some radical things
[50:25] that happen. currency is getting
[50:27] repgged. I'm not necessarily set that
[50:30] fiat is going to go anywhere. Obviously,
[50:32] the incentive the incentives are too
[50:35] strong.
[50:37] Um,
[50:39] but yeah, I mean, we could already see
[50:41] today that this technology
[50:44] is really having profound impacts. You
[50:46] know, obviously Bitcoin is not crypto.
[50:48] Bitcoin is not uh CBDC's. Bitcoin is not
[50:52] stable coins,
[50:56] but we're seeing things like Tether
[51:00] might be the most successful
[51:03] company in the world right now. Like
[51:04] they print money.
[51:06] The current administration
[51:10] sees Tether as a way to offload
[51:13] treasuries, have them buy treasuries,
[51:16] and help address some of our debt
[51:17] issues. Um, so to
[51:23] only look at Bitcoin as a medium of
[51:25] exchange and say, "Oh, it's failing.
[51:26] It's not having an effect on the world,"
[51:28] is a little um
[51:31] myopic. It's a little uh nearsighted.
[51:35] And obviously
[51:37] medium exchange is super important and
[51:39] that's how the world is really going to
[51:41] change. Um but we're already having
[51:44] we're already seeing the effects that
[51:46] Bitcoin is having on finance and
[51:49] geopolitics. It's super interesting
[51:51] right now.
[51:54] Did uh did you guys ever pull out of US
[51:58] availability?
[52:00] No.
 During that?
 No. No. I I mean
[52:05] um
[52:08] did the thought cross my mind? Not
[52:11] really. I mean when Phoenix pulled out
[52:14] it was like an oh [ __ ] moment where I'm
[52:16] like
[52:18] am I going to have to pull out? Like it
[52:21] was it was really a scary day. But,
[52:26] you know, like I I I alluded to earlier,
[52:28] Walker, it's like, "Okay, this thing, if
[52:30] it's going to be successful, it has to
[52:31] be done collectively."
[52:33] And people are like, "Oh, Evan, you
[52:35] should have just shut up. You should
[52:36] have just kept operating and not made us
[52:38] think about is like, "Yeah, probably
[52:40] that would have been the smart thing to
[52:41] do, but we would have been worse off if
[52:48] we didn't inspire some confidence in,
[52:52] you know, our other peers and and more
[52:53] people
[52:55] um you know decide to leave the market,
[52:57] we would have would have sucked. So, you
[53:01] know, obviously
[53:04] everyone's situation is different. Not
[53:05] everyone is a US citizen, but where am I
[53:09] going to go? You know, and the United
[53:12] States, they think they're the police of
[53:14] the world. Even if I were to go
[53:16] somewhere else, they'd probably still
[53:17] think they could go and prosecute me
[53:19] wherever I was in the world. So, the
[53:21] choice was simple. It's like, no, we're
[53:23] staying. We're standing our ground.
[53:25] We're going to take this risk. We're
[53:27] going to keep building. And it paid
[53:30] dividends. And you know, hopefully we
[53:34] inspired confidence in some users and in
[53:37] users of Bitcoin.
[53:39] And hopefully we inspired confidence in
[53:41] in some people that were on the fence.
[53:46] And you know, like I said, like that was
[53:49] a test. I think we passed it with flying
[53:51] colors, but we got to be ready for the
[53:53] next test. And we got to make ourselves
[53:55] more resilient. And we got to have
[53:58] contingencies and, you know, have plans
[54:01] for when these events happen, what we're
[54:04] going to do to,
[54:08] you know, make make sure we can keep
[54:10] providing these services and this
[54:12] technology for users. Um,
[54:17] yeah, it was it was just a test. It was
[54:19] just a test.
[54:21] I I've got to say for on the record that
[54:23] you've got balls the size of
[54:25] watermelons. Uh because like that I mean
[54:28] you know and this is nothing like you
[54:29] said everyone's situation is different.
[54:31] Yeah. Like I don't really want to judge
[54:33] anyone on their actions obviously
 but
[54:35] you did what you did
 situations
[54:37] different legal situations different
[54:39] legal guidance.
[54:41] Um, but yeah, I'm happy we made the
[54:45] decisions we did. And uh, you know, it's
[54:49] not just just me, but you know, tons of
[54:51] other companies do the same. Maybe they
[54:52] weren't as vocal about it. And, you
[54:56] know, that's that's what it's going to
[54:56] take. It's going to take collective
[54:58] action like that. And to like center
[55:01] yourself, take yourself out of markets
[55:03] preemptively without like the state
[55:05] forcing you to do so is like
[55:09] it would it would have been the worst
[55:10] thing. we we could have done and
[55:16] I'm just I'm just so glad we didn't.
 Did
[55:19] Did you guys see just from like a a user
[55:22] standpoint when Phoenix and Waldo
[55:24] Satoshi pulled out, did you guys see
[55:26] your uh user base expand like as a
[55:30] result of that? I I assume so.
 Yeah,
[55:32] probably like
[55:36] 3x or so.
 Wow.
[55:40] So it was
 uh at the same time, you know,
[55:42] it was also when we had just really hit
[55:43] our stride with our services and we're
[55:45] rolling it out. Um
 so good timing. I
[55:49] mean, you know.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
 Shitty
[55:51] situation. Good good timing.
 Yeah. Yeah.
[55:54] Now, now people tell me about it. It's
[55:55] like it's like, dude, like this sort of
[55:58] has added a lot to the ethos of it, too.
[56:00] I'm like,
[56:03] so I didn't even like think about it
[56:05] that way. I mean,
[56:07] we were just trying to figure out what
[56:09] the best thing to do in that environment
[56:11] was and we had to make a tough decision
[56:13] and it wasn't [ __ ] easy for me to
[56:15] make.
[56:17] like you know we just had our first kid
[56:20] in the last year and you know it's
[56:24] around time that stuff was uh ruminating
[56:26] and I'm like okay
[56:30] am I going to run the risk of not being
[56:31] there for my kid
[56:34] or
[56:35] am I going to just
[56:38] like bend the knee and be like yep we're
[56:41] not doing this anymore you got to live
[56:43] in this world and set this awful example
[56:45] it's like
[56:47] it's sort of like being in between a
[56:49] rock and a hard place. Um, so yeah, it
[56:52] wasn't easy. It's not something I took
[56:54] lightly, but at the same time, like I I
[56:57] knew my decision within, you know, just
[57:00] a couple of hours of
[57:02] Phoenix like making the decision. And it
[57:05] just didn't seem like there was any
[57:07] alternative. We had to do it.
[57:12] And that's that.
[57:14] Oh, massive respect to you, dude. And
[57:16] I'm I'm glad you continued to to build
[57:19] in the US. I mean, you know, uh
[57:21] purportedly we're, you know, the freest
[57:23] country in the world. So, it is absurd
[57:26] that that companies even felt that sort
[57:29] of pressure in the first place. The last
[57:31] administration was rough. This
[57:32] administration is by no means perfect.
[57:34] And as you correct, as as you correctly
[57:37] said that that can change on a dime,
[57:39] right? Like,
 right. Right.
 Right. Like,
[57:41] and you know, these guys are on a dime.
[57:43] We don't know. Like they're changing
[57:44] their views on all sorts of stuff as you
[57:47] can see in the last week or two.
 Um
[57:51] yeah, so you never know what's going to
[57:52] happen. Um
[57:55] but yeah, you you can just try to, you
[57:58] know, figure out where your hardlines
[58:00] are.
[58:01] Try to plan in advance to the best of
[58:04] your ability. Try to gather the
[58:06] resources that you can. And you know,
[58:09] we're never going to forget the people
[58:11] who had our backs, who helped us out,
[58:12] who helped us navigate that, who reached
[58:14] out and even said, "Hey, we support
[58:15] you," or "Thank you for doing this." Um,
[58:21] those little actions, they meant the
[58:22] world to us. And, you know, we know
[58:27] who's got her back when [ __ ] hits the
[58:29] fan again, if it ever does, god forbid.
[58:32] Um,
[58:34] but yeah, just like it it really just
[58:37] meant a lot the support that we got and
[58:42] being being able to grow our user base
[58:45] and
[58:47] our company and our our services was was
[58:51] a great reward for it too. Um,
[58:54] so
[58:56] yeah, it was it was tense. It was scary,
[58:57] but it it it paid dividends.
[59:01] Well, I want to I want to kind of talk
[59:03] about like okay, you you've grown your
[59:05] user base. You've just uh released uh V
[59:08] uh V11.0,
[59:11] right?
 A version ver or what what's the
[59:14] version number?
 It's 0.11.1 right now.
[59:17] Okay. Okay.
 We call it we call it 11.1.
[59:20] You know, who knows? Maybe we'll drop
[59:22] the zero at some point just randomly
[59:24] like Bitcoin Core did.
 Yeah, screw it.
[59:27] Why not, right? like ver version numbers
[59:29] version numbers are just yeah
 people are
[59:31] like you don't have to go to 1.0 know
[59:34] although we're sort of at a point where
[59:36] we're like okay we sort of want to get
[59:39] to a place where like okay this is the
[59:42] culmination of everything we've done and
[59:44] and I think you know I think that's a
[59:47] lot of our focus like we had built up
[59:49] all these great building blocks over the
[59:51] years the remote node embedded node the
[59:53] LSP services the swap services the
[59:56] cashew and now we have all this arsenal
[59:59] of of tools and now I think A lot of our
[60:03] focus for the rest of the year is like
[60:07] how do we round out the edges? How do we
[60:11] improve the onboarding? How do we
[60:14] identify the biggest pain points? How do
[60:17] we just like really put on our UI UX
[60:20] hat? And obviously like it's not easy
[60:24] that there's a lot of people who are
[60:27] going to bring in and and rely on and
[60:30] help us with this thing. But yeah, I
[60:33] think with our current set of tools
[60:35] right now, I I think that like yeah,
[60:37] this is this is the bones of the 1.0
[60:39] product. It just needs that polish and
[60:42] it needs,
[60:44] you know, those uh user interviews. It
[60:48] needs
[60:50] just a little love and I I think it's
[60:52] really going to shine. And I think like
[60:54] we've really built like today what I
[60:58] personally believe is the most powerful
[60:59] mobile Bitcoin wallet on the planet. And
[61:03] with just a little bit of love, we can
[61:06] make it the best Bitcoin wallet, period.
[61:10] Something that you'll be comfortable
[61:11] onboarding anyone, even your grandma,
[61:15] even Maya.
[61:17] And that's that's always been the goal.
[61:19] And
[61:21] it feels really close now. We still have
[61:23] a ton of work, a lot of work, a lot of
[61:26] work that we don't typically do.
[61:30] And it might be a little uncomfortable.
[61:32] It might be difficult, but that's where
[61:33] the best growth happens.
 What What do
[61:36] you What do you mean work that you don't
[61:37] typically do?
 Like, you know, UI, UX.
[61:41] Okay. thinking about how people on board
[61:43] interact with the app, you know, like a
[61:44] lot of our stuff has been like,
[61:48] and I don't think this is necessarily a
[61:49] bad way to build apps, but like really
[61:51] just scratching my own itch, like like I
[61:54] think it would be awesome if I could do
[61:56] this and then build it for myself first
[62:00] and foremost, right? And
[62:03] um if anyone else likes it, that's just
[62:05] icing on the cake. Like that's how I
[62:07] thought about it for like a long time.
[62:09] And I understand that the app can still
[62:11] be that. It could be the wallet of my
[62:13] dreams and do everything it wants, but
[62:16] there are like different UX flows that
[62:21] can definitely stand to be improved in
[62:23] these. And there's a overwhelming amount
[62:26] of functionality in the app. And there's
[62:29] definitely stuff that we can tuck away
[62:32] in other menus. There's definitely
[62:35] things we could explain better.
[62:38] And
[62:40] it's it's like this sort of
[62:42] introspection looking in the mirror
[62:46] that we're all going to really have to
[62:48] do more widely um for Bitcoin to reach
[62:54] peak adoption
[62:56] and that's what we're going to be trying
[62:58] to do yet.
 Let let me let me ask you a
[63:01] question on that because like I mean I
[63:03] like uh I I love Zeus as a as an app.
[63:07] Um, it is like for me, you know, I I
[63:10] like I get it also like I get what you
[63:13] guys are uh are trying to do. I I know
[63:15] enough about how things work on the the
[63:17] back end and channels and everything
[63:18] else like things make sense to me. Do
[63:21] you think, and this is not about Zeus
[63:23] specifically, but let's just say more
[63:25] more broadly, like are we ever going to
[63:27] be to a point where the majority of
[63:30] people, let's just classify majority,
[63:32] over 50% of people are using Bitcoin in
[63:37] a uh how do I say this? In a way that is
[63:41] uh further along the the self-s
[63:44] sovereignty spectrum than 50%. You know
[63:46] what I like they're using it like I
[63:49] think sovereignty is a spectrum like
[63:50] many things like you're never going to
[63:52] be perfectly sovereign. Um you can be
[63:55] pretty much a slave though perhaps
[63:56] that's the other end of the spectrum.
[63:59] Like how realistic is it what actual
[64:02] penetration of the of the world in a
[64:05] hyper bitcoinized future? Like what
[64:07] maybe a better question is what does
[64:08] that mean to you? Does that mean it's a
[64:10] majority of people that are actually
[64:12] using Bitcoin in a relatively self-s
[64:15] sovereign way? Or does that just mean
[64:17] that Bitcoin itself is ubiquitous? It's
[64:19] the water that the fish swim in. People
[64:22] are using it, but they don't even know
[64:23] it and they don't care about the method
[64:25] in which they're using it. Whether that
[64:27] be custodial, non-custodial, whatever.
[64:29] It's just it's so ubiquitous that that's
[64:31] just what hypercoinization means. Where
[64:33] do you fall on that?
[64:35] That's a really loaded question.
[64:38] But self custody
 like let's let's break
[64:41] down like
[64:43] is
[64:45] is it realistic to think that most
[64:47] people
[64:49] will hold their own keys
[64:53] to you know underlying Bitcoin? Um
[64:58] probably not.
[65:00] But that doesn't mean that that's not a
[65:02] worthwhile ideal to strive for.
[65:06] And even if we'd never crossed that
[65:08] threshold, I think these are the things
[65:10] that are important
[65:13] one that the average person
[65:16] can do that can decide to go and hold
[65:19] their own keys if they so choose.
[65:22] And then on the other side of it,
[65:26] thinking about the systemic risks
[65:31] of this world where people aren't
[65:34] holding most of their keys, where those
[65:36] destructions can happen. Um, you know,
[65:40] stuff like running fractional reserves,
[65:43] um, manipulating the markets. Um,
[65:49] we can still strive to have those
[65:53] bitcoins held by enough parties for
[65:55] users to have them across enough
[65:57] different custodians.
[65:59] Um, to have the rails between them and
[66:02] the ability to switch custodians and
[66:05] leverage rails like people are using
[66:07] lightning today. Um,
[66:11] I I think that's what's important. Um we
[66:17] people are are so passionate about using
[66:19] Bitcoin the right way
[66:21] you know running it self-custodially run
[66:24] your own node doing it privately
[66:28] I think mainly because they have this
[66:30] fear that is I think very real right
[66:33] we're that
[66:36] in a lot of ways we run the risk of
[66:38] recreating the existing financial system
[66:42] and from that perspective. I entirely
[66:46] understand
[66:48] uh the toxicity, the name calling, the
[66:52] just trying to jump into these groups
[66:55] and say, "Ah, you're in the in group,
[66:57] you're in the out group, you're doing
[66:58] things right, you're doing things
[67:00] wrong." Um, so I I totally
[67:05] sympathize with, you know, those fears
[67:08] at least
[67:09] and,
[67:11] you know, they've played their roles.
[67:13] It's like people should should really be
[67:15] vocal about the importance of these
[67:16] things. We don't want to just recreate
[67:19] the existing financial system and change
[67:21] the name of the units to Bitcoin. Um
[67:25] but at the same time, it feels like even
[67:28] at this point,
[67:32] um there's a lot of freedoms that we've
[67:35] we've taken that that really just can't
[67:39] be taken away. like you can't get the
[67:40] toothpaste out of the tube uh back in
[67:42] the tube, excuse me. Um like from here
[67:46] on out,
[67:50] it's going to be very very difficult to
[67:52] stop people from being able to create
[67:57] their own keys, their own 12 words,
[67:59] memorize them and store their wealth.
[68:01] Like
[68:04] you can try to intervene in that in very
[68:07] unique ways. uh pushing people onto
[68:10] custodial platforms, compromising
[68:13] um networks and hardware and all this
[68:15] sort of stuff. But the underlying
[68:20] ability,
[68:22] it's sort of out of the tube. It's like
[68:25] saying, "Oh, uh the humans learned how
[68:28] to
[68:30] to make fire and we're going to stop
[68:32] that from happening." It just seems
[68:34] ridiculous. So, um, we should still be
[68:37] vigilant. We still should be concerned
[68:39] about this thing being co-opted,
[68:41] especially now, especially in this
[68:42] environment where heads of state are
[68:45] talking about Bitcoin, where we have
[68:47] ETFs, where we have paper Bitcoin,
[68:49] Bitcoin treasury companies,
[68:54] people taking buy pressure away from
[68:56] Bitcoin, the underlying asset, and
[68:58] putting it into these easier way, easier
[69:00] to get into avenues.
[69:02] Um, there's a lot to have your guard up
[69:06] about,
[69:09] but sometimes you also need to kick your
[69:11] feet up and look back at all that's been
[69:14] accomplished already by this technology.
[69:17] And,
[69:18] you know, a lot of these freedoms are
[69:22] now inalienable and and can't be taken
[69:24] away.
[69:25] And
[69:28] you know obviously like I said earlier
[69:30] the state can go and crush any single
[69:32] individual but as a widespread
[69:35] technology
[69:37] it's not going anywhere and we can be
[69:42] very grateful for that and now it's just
[69:46] our job to make sure it reaches its full
[69:48] potential.
[69:51] I say amen to that brother. Uh and and I
[69:55] think that is such a such an important
[69:57] point that like yeah okay
[70:01] it's it's very like it's a it's a you
[70:03] know cliche but you know like you know
[70:06] uh united we sc we stand you know like
[70:08] but separated we fall like it is much
[70:11] harder to stomp the boot of the state
[70:13] down on a massive group of people who
[70:16] are also armed with cryptographic uh
[70:19] cryptographic weapons. Uh, no, those are
[70:21] weapons of defense, right? Those are
[70:23] asymmetric defense-based weapons, but
[70:25] weapons nonetheless. Uh,
 we're doing the
[70:28] Jason Lowry thing now.
 No, I meant more
[70:30] so like they they've tried to classify
[70:32] strong encryption as arms. Like this
[70:34] this happened like wasn't it Adam Adam
[70:37] back who like printed out I forget which
[70:40] uh uh which algorithm on his like on a
[70:43] shirt and like was wearing it across
[70:44] borders. I thought I think it was Adam
[70:46] Back who did that, right?
 Yep. Indeed.
[70:48] It was Dr. back.
 Just a badass move.
[70:51] Like honestly to be like, "Nope. Yep.
[70:53] Okay, I'm going to I guess I'm going to,
[70:54] you know, transporting arms across
[70:56] borders." Like that's amazing. And also
[70:59] just shows the absurdity of trying to
[71:02] classify
[71:03] code, open- source code, as somehow the
[71:07] like to classify the same as the bombs
[71:09] that uh the US sells and drops around
[71:12] the world. Like
[71:14] just insane. They they literally put the
[71:18] RSA algorithm encrypted in a Pearl
[71:21] script that you could scan with an
[71:23] advanced barcode scanner and wrote on
[71:26] it, "Warning,
[71:28] this shirt is classified as a munition
[71:33] and you cannot export it from the United
[71:36] States or give it to a foreign
[71:37] national." But here it is on my shirt.
[71:41] They literally did that and they
[71:45] followed those same principles. They
[71:48] said it as as clearly as they could with
[71:50] this action. Said the toothpaste
[71:54] is out of the tube.
[71:57] There's nothing you can do about it. It
[72:00] is proliferating to all humanity. And
[72:03] that's just such an incredible
[72:06] statement. It's unbelievable. Yeah, that
[72:07] shirt is legendary. Um, I think they
[72:10] have a new like updated version of it on
[72:13] the Blockstream store. I I have it
[72:15] upstairs somewhere.
 Nice.
 It's classic.
[72:18] Shout out to Dr. Beck.
[72:20] Do you uh just slightly kind of
[72:25] different route on this. Obviously, all
[72:27] of the tools that are available to
[72:28] individuals are available to the state,
[72:30] right? Strong cryptography is available
[72:32] to individuals. It's available to the
[72:34] state. Uh, you know, Bitcoin is
[72:37] available to individuals. it's available
[72:39] to the state. All of these things are uh
[72:42] now I'm curious where you s like CBDC's
[72:47] and which are basically just like the al
[72:49] CBDC's are essentially the ultimate form
[72:51] of like AML KYC, right? It's like
[72:53] automated AML KYC using some of these
[72:56] same same tools like it basically
[72:58] inspired by Bitcoin. But CBD is the the
[73:01] ultimate uh fiat shitcoin, right? It's
[73:04] taking fiat to its worst possible uh
[73:06] conclusion. It's taking the only good
[73:08] thing that fiat had, which was cash,
[73:10] which cash is
 cash is great. Physical
[73:13] cash. I mean, that's actually great.
[73:14] That's, you know, anonymous. It's it's
[73:17] excellent. You should use cash more.
[73:19] Uh it's taking that only good thing away
[73:22] from it.
 Where do you think we're at on
[73:26] this kind of uh I mean, you've spoken
[73:28] pretty strongly about KYC, AML, and so
[73:31] I'd love to kind of get your your
[73:32] thoughts on that because obviously I
[73:34] think that's a a travesty. And we see
[73:36] there was just another huge data breach
[73:38] today. And it's just a classic example.
[73:39] Anytime I see a data breach, I'm just
[73:41] like all of our anytime you KYC like
[73:45] that's just an invitation for a data
[73:47] breach. It's an invitation for you to
[73:48] get doxed. It's an invitation for bad
[73:50] things to happen.
 Yeah.
 A CBDC is the
[73:52] ultimate form of KYCing yourself. It's
[73:55] KYCing every single thing you do. It's
[73:58] zero privacy. Where where are you at on
[74:00] this? Do you think that America has
[74:02] rejected this strongly enough? Uh what
[74:04] are your thoughts?
[74:06] I think America's in a you know very
[74:09] interesting position in terms of its
[74:11] CBDC's and it's like as a result of its
[74:14] values. It's not like the CBDC's that
[74:17] we're going to see
[74:20] are going to be the same like a Chinese
[74:21] CBDC um you know tied into WeChat
[74:26] just perfect view into these users. Um,
[74:30] I think one of the funny things that
[74:32] America's done that, you know, we've
[74:36] seen sort of as a result of like the
[74:37] Snowden revelations, it's like they will
[74:40] outsource their spying, for example, to
[74:44] these third parties, to these
[74:46] corporations, right? and they're like,
[74:48] "Okay, we're not going to do this
[74:51] directly, but we'll easily cut a check
[74:54] to these telos or these, you know,
[74:56] financial services companies in exchange
[74:58] for that data, and that'll be okay.
[75:01] That'll be our way to skirt around the
[75:03] constitution." I feel like similarly
[75:06] we're gonna see the role of you know
[75:10] private issuers companies like Tether uh
[75:13] players like JP Morgan Black Rockck who
[75:16] might get into issuing CBDC's play the
[75:19] that role um
[75:22] it might be a marginally better uh in
[75:25] terms of it being distributed widely but
[75:30] it's effectively going to still have
[75:32] those same controls that same
[75:33] surveillance
[75:34] uh because you know they're working so
[75:36] closely with the Treasury Department
[75:39] with Fininsen they have this data they
[75:41] have to answer to government requests
[75:43] they can freeze their currencies like
[75:45] we've seen with Tether time and time
[75:46] again um yeah I think this is like a
[75:52] really preient time to talk about it now
[75:54] that feel like the the Genius Act the
[75:56] new stable coin act I don't know all the
[75:58] ins and outs of it but I know it just
[76:01] passed the Senate I believe and I had
[76:04] passed the House previously, I think.
[76:07] And does Trump just have to sign up on
[76:08] it now? See, like I I'm not following it
[76:10] closely enough,
 but I know that there's
[76:13] I think so. Yeah.
 I think there's going
[76:14] to be a deluge of newly privately issued
[76:19] stable coins and the government's
[76:22] position is going to be to just try to
[76:26] cut deals to to monitor that them
[76:28] individually. Um, that's my outlook on
[76:31] it. Um, we're gonna see what this looks
[76:34] like. I feel like other big players in
[76:36] in the fintech space like like a Stripe,
[76:39] um, PayPal, uh, all all these sort of
[76:43] players are going to get involved, issue
[76:45] their own coins. Um, but yeah, like from
[76:48] a surveillance perspective,
[76:52] you know, the government's going to hook
[76:53] into these companies. Um,
[76:56] on the other side of things,
[77:00] I'm not optimistic, but I think there
[77:03] are opportunities for us to try to,
[77:09] for lack of a better word, or better way
[77:12] of putting it, like Bitcoinize the
[77:13] dollar where we try to
[77:17] build these systems on top of Bitcoin or
[77:21] on top of ecash and we could sort of
[77:24] reap the benefit benefits of the privacy
[77:27] benefits of of the self-custodial
[77:29] properties of these assets. Um but at
[77:32] the same time we have to be realistic
[77:34] and be like okay um the underlying asset
[77:38] is
[77:40] this completely untied to these
[77:43] blockchain assets like the dollar could
[77:45] be printed at a whim and self-custody
[77:48] really means nothing in this context
[77:51] but privacy does and
[77:56] if we have the opportunity for
[78:01] the bit uh for the dollar to be
[78:04] operating on lightning where the
[78:07] payers privacy is fantastic at least and
[78:10] and this receivers uh property uh
[78:12] privacy properties are are getting much
[78:14] better especially over the last couple
[78:16] of years or
[78:19] the properties of cashew where you don't
[78:23] know how much any individual user has or
[78:25] or who's what and you can't stop any
[78:29] individual
[78:31] or shut down their account, you have to
[78:33] rug the whole mint. Like I I think there
[78:36] might be some interesting opportunities
[78:38] there and if we can
[78:40] take them, we should.
[78:43] But at the same time, what are the
[78:46] incentives for the government to do
[78:48] that? These are going to be, if they
[78:50] exist, they're not going to be
[78:51] sanctioned
[78:52] uh stable coins. There'll be privately
[78:54] issued black market
[78:57] um dollar pegs that are put together in
[79:02] a plethora of different models as we see
[79:04] now. There's algorithmic stable coins uh
[79:08] stable coins uh where
[79:11] uh the issuers are just putting together
[79:14] short or long positions on these
[79:16] exchanges depending on um what their
[79:21] assets and liabilities are. Um,
[79:26] yeah, I mean
[79:29] there's opportunities there and and
[79:31] perhaps
[79:33] that could be an interesting avenue to
[79:35] onboard people into Bitcoin, especially
[79:37] if the rails to dump your Shitcoin,
[79:40] fiat, dollar coins, whatever, and flip
[79:43] into Bitcoin is as easy as making a
[79:44] payment or pressing a button. That would
[79:47] be phenomenal. That's definitely a lofty
[79:51] uh but worthwhile aspiration to have.
[79:55] Um but at the same time, let's not rely
[79:57] on that. Let's try to onboard people
[79:58] onto Bitcoin directly. Let's try to show
[80:00] them the way
[80:02] and
[80:05] just go from there one day at a time,
[80:07] one person at a time.
[80:10] And a quick uh uh just fact check for on
[80:13] both of us. Uh it it still has to go to
[80:14] the House, but it did pass the Senate
[80:16] 6830.
 So it didn't go through the House.
[80:18] Okay.
 Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's uh it's
[80:20] it's going to the House next. And
[80:21] honestly, I I haven't followed it super
[80:23] closely just because it's like uh I know
[80:26] that a lot of people are super jazzed
[80:27] about stable coins right now. I just I
[80:29] don't find it quite as interesting. I
[80:31] mean, the the the whole point of it is
[80:33] literally like this is like Senator
[80:35] Gillibrand like quoting her. It's like,
[80:37] you know, protect US dollar dominance or
[80:39] safeguard dollar dominance.
 Yeah. the
[80:42] increase demand for treasuries. It's
[80:43] like how what is the appeal for us,
[80:46] Walker? I mean, and you know, I
[80:48] completely understand people in like uh
[80:51] these countries where they have like
[80:52] much weaker currencies just wanting it.
[80:54] Like it makes sense to want tether in
[80:57] Turkey, you know, like
[81:00] their currency is dog [ __ ] Like we
[81:01] complain about it is terrible.
 It's
[81:04] really bad in other places. And you
[81:06] know, we have easy access to these
[81:08] dollar rails, these dollar banking, uh,
[81:10] and financial services. So, you know, at
[81:14] at the same time, we're probably the
[81:17] worst people to be talking to about
[81:20] stable coins and,
[81:22] you know, what usage looks like. Um, I
[81:25] could only just provide my guidance on
[81:27] like
[81:28] privacy perspective and how I think it's
[81:31] going to be surveiled. Um, but yeah,
[81:34] there's it's obviously
[81:37] like I said earlier, Tether's like the
[81:38] biggest company in the world. There's
[81:40] very real demand for it. It's not just
[81:43] an artificial thing propped up by the
[81:45] government, but the government is going
[81:46] to take advantage of this demand and use
[81:50] it to sell other treasuries.
[81:54] Then the lifespan of the dollar.
[81:57] Yeah. And you know, to be fair, it's
[81:59] like the the dollar is, as far as fiats
[82:01] go. Like, if the dollar has fallen, that
[82:04] likely means pretty much every other
[82:06] fiat currency in the world has already
[82:08] collapsed if we're being honest. Like,
[82:09] people like to single out the dollar.
[82:11] It's like, okay, the dollar is going to
[82:13] be one of the last dominoes to fall.
[82:15] It's it's not the first. You know what I
[82:16] mean? We like it's that's just a reality
[82:18] of the situation.
 Slowest melting ice
[82:20] cube. And you know when the dollar
[82:24] eventually falls
[82:27] um
[82:29] you know it's it's going to be at the
[82:30] cusp of dystopia or utopia or you know
[82:33] probably just a b multipolar world where
[82:36] it's a little bit of both probably bad
[82:38] in some places probably amazing in some
[82:40] others. Um,
[82:43] it's a bit scary to think about, but you
[82:46] know, nothing lasts forever and
[82:48] everything has its own lifespan. And,
[82:52] you know, as much as I really love
[82:54] American values, uh,
[82:59] a lot of a lot of late empire
[83:01] late stage empire vibes right now. Uh,
[83:04] and a lot of scary things going on in
[83:06] the world. And
[83:08] obviously, change is the only constant.
[83:11] So,
[83:12] we'll see what happens.
[83:15] Yeah. I mean, I I won't deny the the
[83:18] scariness of things happening in the
[83:19] world right now and the latest stage
[83:21] empire vibes as well. I I again though,
[83:24] it's like it's it's difficult for me to
[83:26] see the United States collapsing before
[83:31] basically everywhere else has collapsed
[83:34] just realistically, you know. And maybe
[83:36] I'm maybe I'm totally wrong. I also, you
[83:38] know,
 it's like if there's one thing
[83:41] we've realized in, you know, in this
[83:42] fiat world, it's man, the powers that be
[83:44] are really good at kicking the can down
[83:46] the road. Like they're really good at
[83:48] kicking it down the road just just until
[83:50] they all, you know, get to retire.
 In a
[83:52] lot of ways, like obviously like, okay,
[83:54] we want a hyper bitcoinized world
[83:56] tomorrow. We want a better world for our
[83:58] children tomorrow, right? Um, but at the
[84:00] same time, it would probably most
[84:04] definitely
[84:05] be better to have like an easy
[84:07] transition onto the Bitcoin standard
[84:10] instead of like an oh [ __ ] here's
[84:12] societal collapse and figure it out and
[84:16] just mass chaos. And
[84:20] so,
 yeah,
 I think I think a little
[84:23] patience will will go a long way. Um,
[84:28] and you know, like I said, I'm not
[84:30] expecting fiat collapse tomorrow either.
[84:33] I I think they're going to repe it.
[84:36] They're going to do all sorts of new
[84:38] arrangements
[84:39] and, you know, we should fully expect
[84:43] fiat currency to be around for a long,
[84:45] long time, for generations and
[84:47] generations. Um, that being said,
[84:51] humanity can still benefit from Bitcoin
[84:55] greatly while it's still around.
[85:00] That doesn't that doesn't mean we should
[85:02] be working to extend the lifespan of it,
[85:04] though. So,
 be careful what you work on,
[85:07] be careful what you wish for, and um,
[85:10] you know, just try to be mindful and uh,
[85:13] have intention with your actions.
[85:17] Speaking of intention with actions, what
[85:19] are you most excited uh that to kind of
[85:22] you know, you mentioned some of the
[85:23] things you need to tweak about about
[85:24] Zeus and we we've gone in a I think a
[85:27] big wide uh wide arc here and we're
[85:29] coming back a little bit to where we
[85:30] started, but you've you've got a lot of
[85:32] stuff in this uh this latest release.
[85:34] You guys have done a lot uh over, you
[85:37] know, even the past couple years. Is
[85:39] there something, you know, beyond the
[85:40] the UIUX stuff that you're really uh you
[85:44] want to make sure you turn on if you can
[85:46] something you can talk about? I know
[85:47] some stuff may be under the hood still,
[85:49] but like is there something that you
[85:50] think like, oh, like we really need to
[85:53] get this in the app and I can't freaking
[85:55] wait for it to happen.
[85:57] Um,
[86:03] or are you getting close to like
 getting
[86:05] close? There's Well, I definitely know
[86:06] where the freckles are, the spots, the
[86:08] things people struggle with. I think
[86:11] some optionality on how the embedded
[86:13] node works,
[86:15] how you sync it to chain, stuff like
[86:17] that. Like just a lot of technical
[86:18] stuff. I know that once we flesh out a
[86:22] little more, it's really going to shine.
[86:23] Well, no, honestly, well, the thing I'm
[86:25] most excited about right now is like
[86:26] talking with merchants, onboarding
[86:28] companies. Um, you know, Bitcoin
[86:31] adoption and tooling from the uh
[86:34] consumer side, I think, is actually
[86:37] really good right now. Tons of
[86:39] optionality. It's again, super easy to
[86:41] use. Lightning is the de facto rails for
[86:44] Bitcoin. Everything's interoperable. you
[86:48] get out of uh you know a KYC account to
[86:53] uh self-custodial lightning wallet very
[86:56] easily with really good privacy like all
[86:58] that stuff is great
[87:01] the uh business side tooling is not so
[87:06] great needs a lot of work but has a lot
[87:09] of opportunity right now a lot of demand
[87:11] I think some awesome things are going to
[87:12] be built and I more than anything more
[87:15] than any technology in Zeus or any
[87:17] products we're building. I am just
[87:18] really excited in general for adoption
[87:21] to grow on the merchant side and that's
[87:23] where we're also going to be spending a
[87:24] lot of focus on um and are actually
[87:27] really focusing on right now like we're
[87:30] talking with three pretty interesting
[87:34] uh merchants this week um that we're in
[87:38] various stages of onboarding and you
[87:40] know we really see this demand ramping
[87:43] up and
[87:45] yeah I I don't I mean there there are
[87:47] improvements that I'd like to see come
[87:50] to lightning and even to the base
[87:52] protocol like we we recently signed a
[87:54] letter signaling our support for uh a
[87:57] CTV
[87:59] uh CSFS software
[88:03] whether I think that's going to actually
[88:04] come to fruition
[88:07] I really don't know I think uh some of
[88:09] the tribalism going on right now is
[88:10] going to make that exceptionally
[88:12] difficult but
 can you explain in ADIQ
[88:14] terms what that means
[88:17] Um,
[88:19] yeah, covenants. Uh, covenants allow you
[88:21] to put spending restrictions on your
[88:25] Bitcoin. It's all optional. It's all
[88:27] optin, but it's going to pave the way
[88:30] for a lot of L2 systems to work more
[88:33] efficiently. Um,
[88:36] this includes uh Lightning, this
[88:38] includes stuff like Arc, this includes
[88:44] uh UX for coin joints. Um, yeah, just a
[88:48] lot of things you could do um much more
[88:51] passively uh with coin joints
[88:54] um
[88:56] and sort of take your your setup
[88:58] offline. Um, super exciting. Um, and
[89:02] then just in general, uh, what you can
[89:06] do with vaults,
[89:07] like spending restrictions that you can
[89:10] have for your personal stash, uh, to
[89:14] ensure that your family and your savings
[89:17] are are safe without really having to
[89:19] rely on a third party. Like right now we
[89:22] have really good tooling that you can do
[89:24] with collaborative multi-IG
[89:27] uh like these companies like Unchained
[89:29] or or Casa signing tools like stuff like
[89:33] Nunchuk mobile wallet makes multi-IG
[89:35] really easy, Phoenix hardware wallets um
[89:40] that allow you to do all these crazy
[89:42] things, but a lot of them like really
[89:44] require third party help. If you have a
[89:46] vault, you can say, "Hey, my money is in
[89:49] this vault. It has a
[89:52] three-day, 14 day, three month, six
[89:55] month cool down period and I can send
[89:58] something out into transit. I don't need
[90:01] to get this money until the end of that
[90:03] period. But if I see anything is messed
[90:06] up, flow it back. I have an exit path.
[90:10] Bring it back, put it back in the vault
[90:12] or kick it out somewhere else where I
[90:13] know it's safe.
[90:15] and the ability to create this
[90:22] uh
[90:25] this timelmited
[90:28] place for your Bitcoin to live
[90:31] um for these big transfers is like is
[90:33] huge. Um there's really reduces the
[90:38] ability for someone to break into your
[90:39] house to stick a gun to your head. It's
[90:42] like no, it's in the vault. Like
[90:44] someone else or or if it's not me claw
[90:48] it back uh within that time period and
[90:51] it gives you just like a whole lot of
[90:54] asurances. It it puts time on your side
[90:57] when you're doing self custody. And I
[91:00] think that vaults alone
[91:03] are worth activating uh OPCTV for. I I
[91:07] truly do. I I think for self custody to
[91:10] to really flourish and for the
[91:11] individual to really take it into their
[91:13] own hands and reap these benefits, get
[91:16] rid of these security concerns, vaults
[91:19] and and covenants go so so far. And
[91:23] that's why I've been a real ardent
[91:24] supporter of them on top of the benefits
[91:26] we get with L2s, Arc, Lightning, Coin
[91:29] Joints, new constructions we haven't
[91:31] even thought of. Um
[91:34] and yeah, I just don't want Bitcoin to
[91:36] to stagnate either. The discussions have
[91:38] been really interesting right now. Um
[91:41] because a lot of people are opposed to
[91:42] change on Bitcoin because the secondary
[91:46] effects of say something like Taproot
[91:48] and um you know enabling or at least
[91:51] making stuff like ordinals or or rather
[91:55] inscriptions easier
[91:57] uh has left like a lot of people like
[91:59] risk averse and not wanting to change
[92:01] Bitcoin at all. And I understand that.
[92:05] But still like Bitcoin usage overall in
[92:08] the world is still super low. Uh Bitcoin
[92:11] is a medium of exchange still not widely
[92:14] adopted. Uh and I really think that
[92:16] these op codes are simple. They're well
[92:19] reviewed.
[92:20] Um I don't think there although you can
[92:24] never know for sure. I I don't see any
[92:26] major impacts in the same way that a new
[92:29] uh scripting type has. I think Tapoo is
[92:33] a much bigger can of worms. Um
[92:37] yeah, of course I love this technology,
[92:40] want to protect it, but also want it to
[92:41] be
[92:43] as easy to use um
[92:47] in into use case as money as it can be.
[92:49] And I think that these the software um
[92:53] does that. It's very much worth
[92:55] considering and I'm been loving the
[92:58] discussions that we've been having the
[93:01] last week or two since this letter we
[93:03] signed has been out. Obviously, a lot of
[93:06] push back, but just the fact that these
[93:07] discussions have been happening
[93:10] uh have been fantastic and I think it's
[93:11] much more productive than arguing about
[93:14] uh relay policy or some of the other
[93:17] even more shallow topics the community
[93:19] has been talking about. So, it's been
[93:20] really great to champion that and see
[93:23] where that goes. So, we'll see. We'll
[93:25] we'll see what happens. Hopefully, we
[93:26] have
[93:28] uh an activation client maybe end of the
[93:32] year, probably next year.
[93:35] We'll see. Um
[93:38] but even if we don't get it activated,
[93:41] still a ton of stuff that we have to
[93:43] work on in Bitcoin and still a lot of
[93:45] things we can do to make adoption more
[93:48] widespread.
[93:50] Do you think the uh uh the filters
[93:54] debate is a important one right now or
[93:58] do you view that as a bit of a
[93:59] distraction?
[94:01] It's not entirely a distraction and I'm
[94:04] very sympathetic to the view that
[94:05] Bitcoin shouldn't just be a general
[94:06] storage database, but at the same time
[94:10] um
[94:13] this there's a lot of noise. There's a
[94:14] lot of noise. There's a lot of
[94:16] tribalism.
[94:17] Um,
[94:21] really
[94:22] at the end of the day, it's your node.
[94:24] It's your rules. You should run the
[94:26] policies that you want. I fully believe
[94:28] in the ability for people to run
[94:29] whatever node implementation they want.
[94:32] Uh, I probably,
[94:36] you know, the the one single
[94:37] implementation for everyone is probably
[94:39] not the best way to go. I think it's
[94:41] better to
[94:43] have competing implementations. Uh
[94:46] centralizing power of course is
[94:48] dangerous. Um there have been some red
[94:52] flags for sure that out of the core camp
[94:55] and how that's organized. Uh but at the
[94:58] same time it's definitely been
[94:59] overstated.
[95:01] Um
[95:03] you know there's there's a lot of nuance
[95:04] to it but it's definitely not the end of
[95:06] the world. the relay policies, you can
[95:09] just run an older version of core or,
[95:13] you know, if you're technically
[95:14] inclined, you can run the latest version
[95:16] without the commits that you don't like
[95:17] on it. Um, but generally speaking,
[95:22] like I've been saying this whole show,
[95:24] people are going to use Bitcoin
[95:25] differently.
[95:27] This isn't a consensus change.
[95:31] Bitcoin isn't really changing at its
[95:33] core.
[95:34] um your node, your rules,
[95:36] you should use Bitcoin in the way that
[95:39] makes most sense for you. Um
[95:43] so yeah, love to see a lot of people
[95:46] spinning up their own nodes though. It's
[95:48] fantastic.
[95:50] Spin up a node, run it,
[95:52] use it for your transactions. If you're
[95:55] just spinning up a node and
[95:58] just having it talk on the internet and
[95:59] you're not doing with it anything with
[96:01] it just to increase a number on a chart
[96:04] on the pie chart like I don't who cares
[96:06] about that. But if you're using it
[96:10] that's amazing. You
[96:12] validate your own transactions hold your
[96:13] own keys. It's all we've ever really
[96:16] wanted.
[96:18] Man that's a a heck of a note I think to
[96:22] wrap up on. We've been running here for
[96:24] a little little over 90. Is there
[96:25] anything uh we we didn't cover that you
[96:28] wanted to make sure we touched on either
[96:29] about you know Zeus or where do you want
[96:31] to send people? Uh yeah, feel free to to
[96:33] to show anything you want right now.
[96:36] Let's do it. Uh check out the wallet.
[96:37] We're at zeusln.com. We're on Nster.
[96:40] We're on X. We have a Telegram group.
[96:43] Everything is linked on the website.
[96:45] That's Zeusln.com.
[96:48] Check out the wallet. You can get
[96:49] started with a Cashew wallet. You get a
[96:53] free lightning address. You could put
[96:54] that in your Nster bio. You can start
[96:56] accepting zaps. When you get enough
[96:58] stats that becomes economically viable
[97:00] to upgrade to self- custody, we're going
[97:02] to bug you about it. Uh but once you get
[97:04] your own Lightning Channel, you got some
[97:08] funds in self-custody. Those messages
[97:10] are going to go away. You can reap the
[97:13] benefits.
[97:15] Keep that cashew wallet. Sweep to self
[97:17] custody.
[97:18] whenever makes sense for you
[97:21] and you could keep going on that
[97:22] journey. You be can become that self-
[97:24] sovereign full node runner. You can
[97:27] point your lightning address that you've
[97:30] kept this whole journey to your full
[97:31] remote node using the offster wallet
[97:33] connect.
[97:35] And yeah, we've got a whole lot of other
[97:37] tools that we're working on. Our point
[97:39] of sale products are going to be
[97:40] improving. We were working with new
[97:42] merchants. We just started doing our
[97:44] proof of concept for selling digital
[97:46] goods on zeuspay.com.
[97:48] Go check out uh Bitcoin for institutions
[97:52] by our friend fundamentals. That's all
[97:54] linked on our social profiles. Go check
[97:55] that out.
[97:58] And yeah, just, you know,
[98:01] think critically, use Bitcoin in a way
[98:03] that makes sense for you and uh you
[98:06] know, make Bitcoin payments your way.
[98:09] That's it.
[98:11] Amen to that. Evan, thanks so much for
[98:13] coming on here, man. Great uh great to
[98:15] finally get you on the show.
 I really
[98:16] appreciate it. I'm The only thing I'm
[98:18] really confused about is like it's the
[98:20] Titcoin podcast. I don't mentioned
[98:22] breast once on the show.
 Maybe maybe
[98:25] when you have me back, we can hit on
[98:27] that. I guess
 you you come you come for
[98:28] the tits, you stay for the bits. That's
[98:30] how you know it it's it's really just uh
[98:33] it's really just to hook hook people in
[98:34] who would otherwise uh find Bitcoin
[98:36] itself too boring. I I do have BIP 6969
[98:40] as well. Um which yeah, it's it's a
[98:42] pretty serious BIP that I've published.
[98:44] Uh so if you ever want to check that
[98:46] out, it's it's pretty fascinating.
 Okay,
[98:48] I have some reading to do tonight.
[98:51] Seriously though, man, appreciate you
[98:52] coming on here. Welcome back anytime.
[98:54] Thanks again, Walker. It's been great.
[98:56] Likewise, man. Talk soon.
