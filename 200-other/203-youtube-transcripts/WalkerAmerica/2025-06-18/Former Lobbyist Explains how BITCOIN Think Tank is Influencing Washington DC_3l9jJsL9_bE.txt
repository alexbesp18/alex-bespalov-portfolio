--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Our mission is really simple. Like we
[00:01] want to educate Washington DC on
[00:03] Bitcoin. Cuz if Bitcoin's going to be
[00:05] successful, then eventually the largest
[00:07] nation in the world is going to say,
[00:09] "What's that all about? What's going on
[00:10] with that?" Uh anyone who thinks that
[00:12] Bitcoin could become successful and the
[00:14] United States government was just going
[00:15] to be like, "I know fifth largest asset
[00:17] in the world. C I'll figure it out
[00:18] later." You're out of your mind. That's
[00:20] just not how it works. And uh maybe you
[00:21] wish it worked that way and that's fine,
[00:23] but it doesn't. With regards to Bitcoin
[00:25] and the government, the worst case
[00:27] scenario would be Bitcoin just boom out
[00:30] of nowhere, you know, 10 trillion market
[00:34] cap or whatever or, you know, blows past
[00:36] gold and a bunch of people get in the
[00:38] room in Washington DC and they're like,
[00:40] "What's up with this Bitcoin thing?" And
[00:41] nobody knows and they're like, "Yeah, I
[00:43] heard it's like a scam or I heard, you
[00:45] know, I remember the FTX thing." Like
[00:47] that was a total rugpool. Um, I don't
[00:49] know, but like this is endangering the
[00:51] entire financial system. Like we got to
[00:53] kill it. like we got to figure it out.
[00:54] We need to ban mining, whatever they
[00:56] would want to do. And you say, well,
[00:58] they couldn't kill Bitcoin. Probably
[01:00] not, but they sure as hell could try and
[01:03] sure wouldn't be fun in the meantime,
[01:04] right? And so that's what we want to
[01:06] avoid. We want people to, you know, be
[01:08] like, "Oh, yeah. I've actually met with
[01:10] many Bitcoiners over the last, you know,
[01:11] 5 10 years, and I think this is actually
[01:14] really important, and I'm glad it's
[01:15] successful, and I actually think the
[01:17] United States, I think we benefit from
[01:19] this. I think the world benefits from
[01:21] this." And here's why. And if we want to
[01:22] talk more in depth, like let me bring
[01:24] some people in who know a lot about it.
[01:25] That's where we want to be at.
[01:34] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:36] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:38] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:41] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:44] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:46] Bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:49] right now, remember you are still early.

[02:19] for everything else. Without further
[02:21] ado, let's get into this Bitcoin talk.
[02:25] [Music]
[02:31] All right. Well, welcome. It's been like
[02:34] a whole what week, week and a half since
[02:36] we've seen each other. Yeah. 10 days.
[02:40] Feels like Yeah. Uh the last 10 days
[02:42] have been about what two months. Uh it's
[02:44] been Yeah. Yeah. It's it's always
[02:46] interesting coming off the the
[02:48] conference, let's say, like the
[02:50] conference high because especially
[02:52] something something about Vegas is like
[02:54] it is like a sucks a lot of extra energy
[02:57] out of you. Like the conferences are
[02:59] always tiring, but Vegas just like
[03:01] really seems to like strip you down to
[03:03] to bare bones. Uh but yeah, I'm I'm
[03:06] mostly recovered. I think it's a mystery
[03:09] why. I don't know why Vegas just uh
[03:12] sucks it out of you. Maybe it's the 3:00
[03:14] a.m. nights. Listen, I think Vegas is a
[03:16] lot like Washington DC. Uh, you know,
[03:18] I'm there for a few days and like I got
[03:20] to get out or it starts to kind of creep
[03:21] into my pores a little bit. You're uh
[03:24] you're not based in in Washington.
[03:26] You're in uh Nashville area. Yeah.
[03:29] Middle Tennessee City area. Yep. Okay.
[03:31] Nice. Nice. I I like Nashville a lot.
[03:33] I'll be honest. It's a I I like Vegas a
[03:35] lot, too. Um not to always be on the
[03:38] strip, but like I lived there for like 5
[03:40] months or so, and there's honestly a ton
[03:42] of natural beauty around there. I love
[03:44] that. Like you can go 20 minutes outside
[03:45] the city and be in the middle of a what
[03:47] looks like a Martian landscape. My
[03:49] biggest critique is that there's just no
[03:51] trees, man. Like there's just there's
[03:53] just no trees. And I like trees. No
[03:55] trees, no shade, man. Uh it's brutal.
[03:58] And uh but yeah, it's awesome. It's an
[04:00] awesome place to kind of do outdoorsy
[04:01] stuff if you catch it the right way and
[04:03] you're cool with the weather. It's it's
[04:04] a really fun area outside the strip. But
[04:07] man, yeah, you we camp out on the strip
[04:08] for a week and it's going to be a month
[04:10] before you're you're back to baseline.
[04:13] Yeah. Yeah. Seriously. Well, and and I
[04:15] assume that uh you guys have kind of hit
[04:17] the ground running coming back into this
[04:20] because you do have the summit coming
[04:21] up. I want to give a shout out to that
[04:23] too. So, for anyone that doesn't know,
[04:24] uh you are with uh the Bitcoin Policy
[04:26] Institute and you guys do have a summit
[04:28] coming up June 25, 26th, Washington DC.
[04:32] Uh I will be there, which I'm very
[04:33] stoked about. My lovely wife will be
[04:35] there as well. btcpolicysummit.org.
[04:38] And you can use the promo code walker
[04:39] for 25% off. And I am not getting paid
[04:41] to say that. Uh, and I'm getting no
[04:43] kickbacks from you using that promo
[04:45] code. You just get 21% off for using it,
[04:48] for being a fan of this show. So, I'm
[04:50] just excited to uh to come and do some
[04:52] orange pilling in the swamp, to be
[04:54] honest. Yeah, we're excited to have you,
[04:56] man. Glad you're going to be able to
[04:57] make it up and and the whole family uh
[05:00] be able to join. Appreciate the shout
[05:01] out. It's going to be a great couple
[05:03] days. Uh, I think that anyone who joins
[05:06] will be like very pleasantly surprised
[05:08] at the experience and come away with an
[05:11] appreciation not just for like our work
[05:13] or whatever, but like probably that
[05:15] hopefully that, but hope but hopefully
[05:16] like the uh what we're up against and
[05:19] what we're trying to achieve in
[05:20] Washington DC as an industry and as like
[05:22] a network. You know, I think it's
[05:25] honestly like I love what you guys are
[05:26] doing and I think a lot of Bitcoiners uh
[05:29] and I've myself had this thought before
[05:31] thinking about it more deeply that like
[05:33] ah you know, we shouldn't even engage
[05:35] with the political apparatus at all. You
[05:37] know, bit Bitcoin doesn't care. Bitcoin
[05:39] doesn't you know doesn't need uh
[05:41] politicians, politicians need Bitcoin.
[05:43] And yes, that is something uh I I agree
[05:45] with and and say all the time myself.
[05:47] However, it's one of those situations
[05:48] where it's like you may not care about
[05:50] politics, but politics cares about you.
[05:53] America, I think, is a place where uh
[05:56] the American idea is very closely
[05:58] aligned with the Bitcoin ethos. It's a
[06:01] good place for Bitcoiners. We want to
[06:04] keep it that way ideally. And that does
[06:06] necessarily involve some engagement at
[06:09] the political level. So, it's like
[06:10] again, you don't have to, you know, like
[06:12] you don't have to love it. You don't
[06:13] even have to partake in it. But I think
[06:15] it's good that there are people that are
[06:16] doing it like yourselves at at BPI. I
[06:18] think it is a necessary thing and I'd
[06:21] rather have politicians that are pro
[06:22] Bitcoin than anti- Bitcoin. Like it's as
[06:24] simple as that, right? I think you're
[06:26] you nailed it. Uh maybe probably not not
[06:29] too much left to say. There's there's a
[06:31] couple different ways of looking at it.
[06:32] You know, more kind of the more cynical
[06:35] side of, you know, if you're the old
[06:37] saying, if you're if you're not at the
[06:38] table, you're on the menu. Uh and so
[06:41] that's one way. And then I think the
[06:43] more you know generous or more, you
[06:45] know, hopeful way of of viewing things,
[06:47] I think both are appropriate uh for the
[06:49] record. The other way of looking at it
[06:51] is like somebody told you about Bitcoin
[06:53] and if somebody hadn't talked to you
[06:54] about it, I mean some people I guess
[06:55] organically discovered it like they're
[06:57] developers and their own, you know, like
[06:59] somebody told me about Bitcoin and
[07:01] explained it to me and uh first I didn't
[07:03] really get it and then I thought it was
[07:04] like kind of cool and then I was like
[07:06] wait I figured this thing out. This
[07:07] isn't real. And then you have this whole
[07:09] journey of understanding uh why what
[07:12] Bitcoin is uh why it's useful and then
[07:15] think and then thinking you've figured
[07:17] it out and why it's not useful and why
[07:18] some other thing is going to beat it and
[07:20] then you're like oh actually I'm wrong
[07:21] again. You talk to some other people and
[07:24] you're educated. you become uh you know
[07:27] kind of a kindergartener in Bitcoin uh
[07:30] uh terms of you know your educ Bitcoin
[07:32] education and then you begin to
[07:34] understand more and more and you're you
[07:36] curious about more things and some
[07:37] people kind of stop there they don't
[07:39] have time for it it's not really their
[07:41] thing but they appreciate it and that's
[07:43] what we're trying to achieve in DC is
[07:44] you trying to make every elected
[07:46] official a Bitcoiner who's like running
[07:49] home mining rigs if they want to great
[07:51] but we want to get them to the point
[07:52] where they at least appreciate the
[07:54] technology technology, appreciate the
[07:56] use case, and have a baseline
[07:57] understanding so they're not completely
[07:59] wrong about everything with regards to
[08:01] Bitcoin. Uh that's that's actually far
[08:04] more dangerous than any other outcome.
[08:06] It's someone thinking they understand
[08:07] something when they actually do not.
[08:09] Well, it's like would you rather have uh
[08:11] you know, a bunch of Senator Elizabeth
[08:14] Warren or Senator Cynthia Lumis'? Like
[08:17] which which one would you rather have?
[08:19] I'll take Senator Lumis a hundred times
[08:22] out of a hundred like without question.
[08:24] Uh although Elizabeth Warren does at
[08:26] least make for some good memes and it's
[08:28] nice to have something to push back
[08:29] against. Yeah, we need a good villain,
[08:32] you know. Uh there's, you know, we're
[08:35] not we're not much without a good
[08:36] villain. Uh but in all seriousness,
[08:38] yeah, we're we're spoiled rotten with
[08:40] Senator Lumis. I think I've said this a
[08:41] few times here lately.
[08:44] Most industry groups would, you know,
[08:46] saw off their arm to have a a Senator
[08:48] Lumis on their on their sideline on
[08:50] their team in Washington. It's a rare
[08:53] feat to have someone who not only is
[08:55] like that that public and that strong of
[08:58] a champion for your cause, but to do so
[09:02] in a way that is just like so cool and
[09:05] uh to you can just tell she actually
[09:07] really cares and really gets it and
[09:09] really appreciates not just Bitcoin but
[09:12] uh you know Bitcoiners and I mean she's
[09:15] one of us, right? And that's that's
[09:18] incredibly rare. It's a rare gift and I
[09:20] I hope we never take her for granted. Um
[09:22] and so yeah, I mean while I'd love to
[09:24] have, you know, a dozen llamases up
[09:27] there on the hill, I think, you know,
[09:30] I'll take um you know, we have talk, you
[09:34] mentioned the summit, we have around 10
[09:38] uh you know, congressmen confirmed, a
[09:40] few senators um and and some
[09:43] congressmen. I'll take that um every day
[09:46] of the week of those who are publicly
[09:48] saying, "Hey, you don't have to love
[09:50] this, but like here's how we treat
[09:52] certain industries and we should treat
[09:53] them fairly." Great. Um you know, I
[09:56] think uh it makes sense for um you know,
[10:00] self-custody and uh you know,
[10:03] non-custodial tools to exist and they
[10:05] shouldn't be like prosecuted for that.
[10:07] Fantastic. they don't h you don't have
[10:09] to love Bitcoin to to think it's
[10:12] important that we're able to maintain
[10:15] certain freedoms. Uh and so I'll take
[10:17] that every day over someone who's you
[10:21] know like a lot a lot of politicians get
[10:24] a uh a bad rap for representing or like
[10:28] you know come up publicly saying they
[10:30] support something when it's maybe a
[10:31] cynical meat. I just appreciate people
[10:33] who look at it say this is what it is
[10:35] the rule same rule should apply to
[10:36] everyone. this is about freedom and uh
[10:39] will back us for that reason. I'll take
[10:41] that every day of the week. That's what
[10:42] we're trying to do. Uh and the more
[10:44] elected officials interact with uh
[10:47] Bitcoiners with you know kind of
[10:48] interact with Bitcoin just like use it,
[10:51] understand it, hear from human rights
[10:52] activists.
[10:54] Uh they they get it pretty quickly, you
[10:57] know. Uh they're pretty most of them are
[10:59] pretty smart people and uh they uh they
[11:02] they're like, "Oh yeah, you know, that
[11:05] that makes it just makes sense." Uh, you
[11:07] know, I think we have a little we've had
[11:09] a little bit of a a marketing I
[11:11] personally think Bitcoin has a kind of a
[11:13] funny marketing problem. Um, or has had
[11:16] that in the past. Uh, again, like you
[11:19] said, doesn't need our help. Um, I don't
[11:21] think it needs anyone's help. You know,
[11:22] it's done pretty well on its own, but
[11:25] uh, the people the way we all talk about
[11:28] it is sometimes kind of funny. And, uh,
[11:30] and I see where people get confused. You
[11:32] know, like if you ever met with a
[11:34] mechanical engineer, uh you know, you've
[11:36] got a got some minor problem with your
[11:38] car and they talk you through like how
[11:41] someone built your car and how they
[11:42] would have built it differently and you
[11:44] know, it's a the Bitcoin community is a
[11:47] family primarily of engineers and uh and
[11:50] we're trying to explain Bitcoin to
[11:51] someone who does not think like an
[11:52] engineer and politicians and most of the
[11:55] public uh in fact. And so, you know, uh
[11:58] sometimes I think we're actually too
[12:00] smart and we can overexlain things and
[12:01] over complicate things unnecessarily
[12:04] when we just need to kind of put it on
[12:05] the table. Here's what it is. Here's why
[12:07] it matters. Here's how it's helpful. And
[12:08] here's why it's important to the United
[12:10] States to uh seize an advantage that's
[12:13] right there on the table for the taking.
[12:16] And uh and so you can you kind of play
[12:18] that patriotic angle too if you want. Uh
[12:20] but on its own merits, I think freedom
[12:22] technology is important. And I think if
[12:24] you explain that uh you know with some
[12:26] bullet points, most people in Washington
[12:28] are like, "Oh yeah, that makes sense. Uh
[12:30] I never really I never really thought
[12:32] about it that way." If you're stuck
[12:34] spending dollars, at least stop earning
[12:37] dirty fiat rewards. Use Fold to earn
[12:40] Bitcoin on everyday purchases and
[12:42] regular expenses, groceries, bills,
[12:45] travel, home improvement. I literally
[12:47] just earned 2,23
[12:50] sats buying a $100 Amazon gift card on
[12:53] Fold. You don't even need to use the
[12:55] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[12:58] You can connect your favorite credit
[12:59] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[13:02] on merchant offers or go allin. Make
[13:05] Fold the center of your personal
[13:07] finances. Buy, earn, save, and even get
[13:11] paid in Bitcoin with Fold. Head to the
[13:13] link in the show notes to get started
[13:15] with the ultimate savings toolkit or go
[13:18] directly to use.foldapp.com/r/walker
[13:23] and get yourself $10 in Bitcoin when you
[13:26] sign up. If you've accepted that we're
[13:29] living through the fourth turning, then
[13:30] it's time to get yourself some Bitcoin
[13:33] and then go to bitbox.swiss/walker
[13:35] Swiss/walker and use the promo code

[13:40] open-source Bitcoinon Bitbox 2 hardware
[13:43] wallet. Then get your Bitcoin off the
[13:45] exchange into your own self-custody and
[13:47] prepare yourself for the chaos that is
[13:49] to come. The world is going pretty wild
[13:52] right now, but Bitcoin is ripping and
[13:54] your stack will soon be worth a heck of
[13:56] a lot more in fiat value than it is
[13:58] today as every currency around the world
[13:59] hyperinflates. So now is the perfect
[14:02] time to get your security locked down
[14:04] tight with Bitbox. I really want to
[14:05] emphasize that the Bitbox O2 is easy as
[14:07] hell to use. Whether you're brand new to

[14:31] Let's talk about using Bitcoin the way
[14:33] it's meant to be used. Self-custodial,
[14:36] lightning fast, and ready for the real
[14:38] world. That's exactly what BitKit wallet
[14:41] is all about. Bitkit wallet is a clean,
[14:45] powerful Bitcoin and Lightning mobile

[15:16] driver Bitcoin and Lightning wallet, and
[15:18] it actually feels good to use it. And

[15:37] Or search bitkit wallet in your app
[15:39] store and start using Bitcoin like it's
[15:42] meant to be used. That's bit tit.
[15:48] Well, I think it's interesting, too,
[15:50] because Bitcoin is such an it's such a
[15:52] litmus test, right? It's a basically a
[15:54] test to say, do you actually care about
[15:57] individuals having freedom? Do you care?
[15:59] Like, if you are, in my opinion, if you
[16:02] are anti- Bitcoin, excuse me, if you are
[16:04] anti- Bitcoin, that is anti-American.
[16:07] Like, to be anti- Bitcoin is to be
[16:09] anti-American. It is to be against
[16:11] freedom. It is to to be against the
[16:13] freedom to transact, to hold your own
[16:14] money, to not be debased. like it it is
[16:18] frankly unpatriotic to be anti- Bitcoin,
[16:20] Elizabeth Warren. Uh and I think that
[16:22] that's such an interesting test like if
[16:24] you can have Bitcoin explained to you
[16:26] and by in a very you know simple and
[16:28] coherent way and to say look this is you
[16:30] know this is about individual liberty.
[16:32] This is about you know the freedom to
[16:34] actually own property, the freedom to
[16:35] transact with anyone you you choose to.
[16:38] It's about the freedom to save the value
[16:39] of your time and energy. If you can have
[16:41] that explained to you and then somehow
[16:43] still come away saying, "I don't like
[16:45] this Bitcoin thing, I'd say you don't
[16:47] really have the interest of the American
[16:48] people or people in general at at
[16:51] heart." Like I I think that's a pretty
[16:53] fair statement to make. And I would I I
[16:56] think the that's why again the work that
[16:58] you guys are doing is so important
[17:00] because it has to start with education.
[17:02] It's we were talking before this. It's
[17:05] easy to forget that all of us started
[17:07] from a place of zero knowledge. Like you
[17:09] like you said earlier, you know, we
[17:10] somebody explained it to us or we went
[17:12] down the rabbit hole, whatever, but we
[17:13] started from a place of zero knowledge.
[17:15] 99 something% of the world is currently
[17:19] at that place of basically zero
[17:21] knowledge or only what they've seen on
[17:23] the news about it, which is not great,
[17:25] right? Uh we have to start somewhere and
[17:28] it has to start with education. And I
[17:30] think that's why having these
[17:31] conversations again, you'd rather have
[17:33] people that are at least mildly educated
[17:35] about Bitcoin and can say, "Yeah, this
[17:37] is something I'm for." Versus, "I don't
[17:40] really know what this is. Knee-jerk. I'm
[17:42] against it because I heard that it's
[17:43] money for criminals and drug dealers,
[17:45] money launderers, etc., etc., or you
[17:47] know, whatever whatever, you know, uh,
[17:49] trope it may be." And so, I'm I'm I'm
[17:51] curious, too, you know, uh, maybe we can
[17:54] before we we dive too deep, can you just
[17:56] give a little background of yourself?
[17:58] Who are you? How did you get here today
[17:59] to be to be working uh with BPI as like
[18:02] the kind of I think employee number like
[18:04] number one you said right like you're
[18:07] which is pretty awesome. What what was
[18:10] that journey because I think your
[18:11] background here is really important in
[18:13] terms of setting the tone for what
[18:14] you're doing now and how you're able to
[18:16] be successful at it. Yeah, sure. Uh
[18:20] great question. Yeah, I uh before I you
[18:25] even had heard of Bitcoin uh I uh I
[18:29] spent about a decade in the political
[18:31] world uh in my career. So I you know I
[18:35] mean bio we can just do it like I got
[18:37] out of school and was you know bouncing
[18:39] around like like one does. Uh I was
[18:42] actually working at a factory after
[18:44] college uh because I you know like I was
[18:46] like a lot of uh people who study
[18:48] philosophy in school. you get out and
[18:50] you're like, "Oh, you know, what do you"
[18:52] And so anyway, I was doing some factory
[18:54] work uh right after college and it's
[18:56] pretty good for me. Uh really, I think
[18:58] everyone should do that right after
[19:00] college. It's a good uh contrast with
[19:02] the university experience. Uh I ended up
[19:06] saying, "Oh yeah, you know, um this, you
[19:09] know, politics thing is kind of
[19:10] interesting. I started running state and
[19:11] local working on state and local
[19:13] campaigns and uh you know, you it's a
[19:17] lot like doortodoor sales, right? when
[19:19] you start, I mean, you're knocking
[19:20] thousands of doors in the summer heat.
[19:22] Uh, you meet tons of interesting people.
[19:24] You have conversations with people
[19:26] across the political spectrum. I think
[19:28] that's another thing I recommend to like
[19:30] young people who are just kind of
[19:31] getting in their careers, like do some
[19:32] doortodoor work. Uh, so I think in the
[19:35] first year or so, I knocked 10,000
[19:37] doors, you know, roughly. That's what
[19:39] you want to do is, you know, roll of
[19:40] 10,000 and, uh, for candidates and that
[19:44] was my whole job. So, we're like, you
[19:46] know, state representative races and
[19:47] that sort of thing. just like basic work
[19:50] and um we won a few races and kind of
[19:52] got into the more the campaign side and
[19:54] planning side and um and then from there
[19:56] it was just you know um about eight
[19:59] years in that world working on uh more
[20:02] of the issue side. So you can run uh
[20:06] political campaigns for candidates, you
[20:07] can run issue campaigns and so you know
[20:10] people go vote when they think of a
[20:11] campaign of voting for this person. And
[20:13] normally think of presidential
[20:14] candidates, you know, the big ones. Um
[20:18] there are down ballot issues that you
[20:20] can vote on like should our state do
[20:22] xyz, should our state, you know, cut
[20:24] taxes or, you know, whatever. Um that
[20:27] are not lobbying that are still campaign
[20:29] focused. So that's kind of where I
[20:30] camped out and we worked in 30 40
[20:33] different states depending on the year
[20:35] and the project. Um we had a lobbying
[20:38] team, we had a full scale production
[20:40] team, uh video and everything. So it was
[20:42] just one house, one big shop and I I got
[20:45] to be a part of all of that over the,
[20:46] you know, time I was involved in that
[20:48] industry and it was really, you know, it
[20:51] was great. Uh, I end up spend some time
[20:53] some hard time as a lobbyist. Uh, and
[20:56] that was interesting. Uh, kind of
[20:58] learned the ropes there. Um, and got
[21:01] exposure across AC across that
[21:04] ecosystem. So uh, can I can I ask you
[21:06] uh, if you don't mind, what what
[21:08] industry or industries were you lobbying
[21:10] for?
[21:13] uh the primary client was a large chain
[21:16] of diagnostic imaging centers uh you
[21:18] know at one point in time. Yeah. I mean
[21:20] it was you know kind of like uh um
[21:23] you're you're a hire you know you take
[21:25] on clients like you're a consultant to
[21:26] think of it like that and uh but you
[21:29] also want to I've kind of got a whole
[21:31] bit on lobbyists. I think that's
[21:33] interesting to me. Um just I've you know
[21:36] you look at like pop culture you look at
[21:38] media and the way lobbyists are
[21:40] perceived and obviously the smoke filled
[21:42] rooms and all that kind of thing you
[21:44] see. I'm sure. Yes, that's true,
[21:46] especially at the federal level. But I
[21:48] mean, you know, the uh the further you,
[21:52] you know, the more local you get, the
[21:54] more like good old boy, like I know the
[21:57] person I'm shaking hands with saying it
[21:58] is, but also it's like way more room for
[22:00] corruption. And so, you know, it's like
[22:02] more personal. It's better, but also
[22:04] worse. And so, uh, you know, it's
[22:08] interesting. But I I think lobbyists get
[22:10] a bad rap. I mean, most of the lobbyists
[22:11] I worked with and that I know and I'm
[22:13] still friends with are uh, you know,
[22:16] they built their career off being
[22:17] trustworthy resources for elected
[22:19] officials. If you think of like state
[22:21] houses especially, you have uh uh my dad
[22:24] was a state representative actually for
[22:26] eight years and my home state had term
[22:28] limits which I think are fantastic a
[22:30] fantastic idea that we should examine
[22:32] more closely. uh we permit presidents uh
[22:36] for you know so uh anyway um he did that
[22:39] when I was like in you know when I was
[22:41] growing up and I kind of so I think that
[22:43] helped like kind of see some things but
[22:45] he was a butcher you owned a little
[22:46] grocery store he's a butcher uh and uh
[22:49] cattle farmer and one day somebody like
[22:51] you should run for office and I guess he
[22:53] took him seriously and did it lost lost
[22:55] the race and was embarrassed you know
[22:58] and picked himself up and a few years
[23:00] later ran again and won and had a whole
[23:02] second career
[23:03] uh doing that and uh it was really cool
[23:06] you know for me to see uh you know I was
[23:09] I was the first one from my family to go
[23:11] to college and so you know everybody
[23:12] else is kind of like more blueco collar
[23:14] like doing this and going and he really
[23:16] went for it and uh so he's in you know
[23:19] the state house very little experience
[23:21] business owner like pretty sharp guy but
[23:24] um so there are some things that you
[23:27] know you you're you're elected you're
[23:29] really good at some things maybe you're
[23:30] a doctor maybe you're an attorney Uh
[23:32] maybe you're a butcher and your
[23:35] community says we want you to represent
[23:36] us because there's things that are
[23:38] really important to us and you know
[23:40] let's pull out the [ __ ] on whatever
[23:42] you know and so you're really good at
[23:44] this but there's this whole other thing
[23:45] like diagnostic imaging centers for
[23:47] instance that you're like I don't first
[23:48] of all I don't know what that is you
[23:50] know and uh and so oh x-ray machines you
[23:53] know and so you uh you need someone who
[23:57] understands that and understands the
[23:59] second and third third order impacts of
[24:00] decisions you make as elected official
[24:02] in the laws you pass. If you lie, if
[24:06] you're a jerk, you get one shot and then
[24:10] most people never trust you again, never
[24:12] work with you again. Um, if you are good
[24:15] at your job, if you educate people, if
[24:17] you help teach them and you make them
[24:19] look good, not yourself look good, if
[24:21] you make the elected officials look
[24:22] good, then you're going to have massive
[24:25] success. And so the best lobbyists I
[24:27] know are actually just uh you know
[24:30] really smart people who are who really
[24:32] know their industry have worked in it
[24:34] forever. Most of them have you know in
[24:35] industry and retired out and they're not
[24:39] you know this and so that's the most
[24:40] common misconception. That's why I kind
[24:42] of like took that you know uh side road
[24:45] here with you. But I think it's it's
[24:48] most people when I say they're like oh I
[24:49] never thought about it like that before.
[24:51] Yeah. By the way, this is a safe space
[24:53] for tangents and side roads always, so
[24:56] feel free. Good.
[24:58] So, yeah, I mean, I think that's that's
[24:59] kind of fascinating. And I mean,
[25:02] how I guess maybe this is what we we
[25:04] didn't get did not get to yet, but how
[25:06] did you go from that then to Bitcoin?
[25:09] Like what what was that stepping stone
[25:11] for you where now you are like this is
[25:14] what you're doing? You're well, you're
[25:15] not a lobbyist now. You guys are a
[25:17] nonprofit and a think tank. uh and like
[25:19] we can maybe we can talk about kind of
[25:20] the distinctions there later because I
[25:22] think that is important but how did you
[25:24] make that jump? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for
[25:26] thanks for getting me back on. Uh so
[25:30] I was uh it was like you know co times
[25:33] all sort of thing and uh I had got into
[25:36] I kind of got really interested in
[25:37] Bitcoin for many years. uh wish I had uh
[25:41] you know uh been I wish my purchasing
[25:43] had tracked with my level of interest
[25:45] like most people but I was like really I
[25:48] just thought it was really interesting
[25:49] from a distance and uh kept an eye on it
[25:52] and asked uh asked somebody I like like
[25:56] some random people who to follow on
[25:57] Twitter and I like got a Twitter you
[25:59] know Twitter account at the time uh just
[26:02] to learn about Bitcoin and um one of the
[26:06] you know one of one of the uh must
[26:09] follows was was actually Odell and so I
[26:13] uh followed him religiously for many
[26:15] years and uh and some others and ran
[26:19] into people at meetups. I kind of went
[26:21] to started going to meetups and and it's
[26:23] funny story with I think it was it was
[26:25] Odell actually. Um I was talking with
[26:28] him and you know we're kind of have this
[26:30] similar conversation like oh how'd you
[26:32] get into Bitcoin? Like what do you do?
[26:33] And I was like I'm not telling anyone
[26:35] here. Of course, I show up like in a
[26:37] blazer, you know. I'm like, "Oh, we're
[26:38] going to a it's like a conference, you
[26:40] know. I'm like, everybody looks at me at
[26:42] the meetup like I'm a Fed, you know, and
[26:44] I'm just like, "Oh, I thought it was I
[26:46] assumed it was a business professional
[26:47] type of situation." And you know,
[26:49] Bitcoiners will look like they just came
[26:51] out of the coal mines. Uh, and so, uh,
[26:54] like, "Oh, I'm like stand out like a
[26:57] sore thumb." Um, and uh, so anyway, I
[27:00] started realizing like I'm not going to
[27:01] tell anybody about the whole I'm a
[27:04] lobbyist right now thing. You know, I
[27:05] don't really know if I'm if that's
[27:07] welcome here. Like I just couldn't
[27:08] really dial in the vibe. And uh, after a
[27:11] while I realized like these are just
[27:12] like chill people, cool people um, that
[27:14] are themselves. And um, and I kind of
[27:18] mentioned to a few people what I did and
[27:19] they're like, "Oh, have you met the BPI
[27:21] team?" You know, and I was like, "I
[27:22] don't even know what that is." So I get
[27:24] to know David and Grant, the co-founders
[27:26] of Bitcoin Policy Institute and uh you
[27:29] know within a couple months I had
[27:30] actually qu I quit my job and uh I was
[27:32] no longer in politics. I got burned out.
[27:34] I was kind of out of the loop for a
[27:36] couple years uh on the heels of uh you
[27:39] know just some major projects and
[27:41] overhaul in our political system. And so
[27:43] I I kind of took a it was a good time. I
[27:45] took a sbatical before I got back in.
[27:47] And I I was assured, hey, you're a
[27:49] Bitcoiner who works in politics. You're
[27:51] not working in politics. you're working
[27:52] on Bitcoin and uh but we're we're going
[27:55] to go do this work and that's that's
[27:58] held true uh as the ethos of BPI uh
[28:02] since inception and since the early days
[28:04] we're you we're focused on Bitcoin.
[28:06] We're um honored. You know, we try to
[28:09] represent the industry and and uh you
[28:12] know, the uh the network the best we
[28:14] can. We don't represent everyone. uh we
[28:17] just uh do our work and and try to uh
[28:21] you know try to educate everyone we can
[28:23] about Bitcoin, but we we try to be
[28:25] stewards of the name at least. And uh
[28:28] and so if you're going to put Bitcoin
[28:30] anything on your in your organization or
[28:32] your company, I think you've got or your
[28:34] or your damn podcast, Walker, you know,
[28:36] you got a responsibility there and
[28:37] people are going to hold you to it. Uh
[28:39] like it or not, want it, don't want it,
[28:41] whatever, they're going to. And I think
[28:42] that's a really good thing about our uh
[28:45] our community. No, I I I agree. It's
[28:48] like if you're if you're taking the the
[28:50] Bitcoin name, it should not be in vain.
[28:53] Like you you better, you know, you
[28:54] better mean it. Um but no, so let's and
[28:57] I appreciate the background cuz I think
[28:59] I I always think it's fascinating how
[29:01] people, you know, got into Bitcoin and
[29:03] then found themselves working in this
[29:06] wild emergent industry. And so maybe
[29:08] let's let's let's get into uh let's get
[29:10] into BPI specifically a little bit.
[29:12] Maybe just uh like so what are you doing
[29:15] for BPI? Can we maybe just even take a
[29:17] step back further like how so BPI is not
[29:20] a lobbyist group. It's a think tank. I
[29:23] think tank also kind of has this like
[29:25] mystique about it right for us like non
[29:27] nondc people where it's like think tank.
[29:30] So they're just, you know, taking a
[29:32] bunch of, you know, taking a bunch of
[29:33] money to come up with policies that, you
[29:35] know, benefit, you know, who God only
[29:37] knows who. And like I feel like it's
[29:39] another thing where there's kind of this
[29:40] this like stink to it for a lot of
[29:42] people. But can you can you talk a
[29:44] little about that? How is that
[29:45] different? Uh and just like what is like
[29:47] what is the mission of BPI? Yeah. Oh,
[29:51] that's a great question. Yeah, the think
[29:52] tank thing is funny. uh like you know
[29:55] you got thinkers and doers and so if
[29:57] you're a think tank like you don't I
[29:59] guess that means you don't do anything
[30:01] and so uh so yeah I uh I think that's a
[30:04] great question. So BPI, Bitcoin Policy
[30:07] Institute, we're a 501c3 charity first
[30:09] of all. So we're a nonprofit uh and uh
[30:13] think tank and advocacy organization. So
[30:17] as a uh as a nonprofit, you know, just
[30:20] I'm like the the legal like high level.
[30:22] Um we're different than trade
[30:24] associations. Uh we're different than
[30:27] lobbying firms which are just like, you
[30:29] know, are similar to like a law firm.
[30:31] You hire them to provide certain
[30:33] services. Uh so the difference there is
[30:36] we don't have members. People don't pay
[30:37] dues. People don't uh contract us out to
[30:41] achieve certain things and not those
[30:43] things are right or wrong or whatever.
[30:45] That's just not what we do. So as a
[30:47] charity uh we are supported completely
[30:49] off uh donations. And I told you this
[30:52] earlier before we started, like my whole
[30:54] job, I'm the I'm the head of development
[30:55] for BPI. And uh my whole focus is just
[30:58] making sure we can grow and scale and
[31:00] continue operations and take care of
[31:02] certain projects that we're working on.
[31:04] Uh but back over to our mission and why
[31:06] we exist. Uh on the research side, we
[31:09] have around two dozen fellows and many
[31:13] of those you you know, I know you're
[31:14] friends with uh like the Troy Crosses of
[31:16] the world. Matt Pines was a fellow for a
[31:18] long time. Now he's our executive
[31:20] director at BPI, which is awesome, man.
[31:23] We're thrilled to have him on board
[31:25] full-time. It's a it was a coup for us
[31:27] as an org. And uh but um you know,
[31:31] Marggo Paz, and I could list them all.
[31:34] Sorry if I didn't say your name. I'm not
[31:35] going to list all 24 fellows, but they
[31:36] are not employees of BPI. They are out,
[31:41] you know, in the world. They're
[31:42] professors, PhDs, some of the I think
[31:45] smartest, uh brightest minds. uh
[31:48] focusing and thinking about Bitcoin in
[31:51] the world and that's why we've brought
[31:52] them on. We're lucky to have them and we
[31:55] give them perdms or things or we may in
[31:58] some cases buy out uh some of their
[32:00] course load. So instead of, you know,
[32:03] teaching five classes, they'll teach
[32:04] four classes. And then one class,
[32:06] instead of teaching it, they're able to
[32:08] just really focus in and like do some
[32:10] like deep dive research on, you know,
[32:14] renewables and Bitcoin mining or
[32:16] whatever, you know, or Bitcoin and
[32:18] national security or uh, you know,
[32:20] something that, uh, I probably don't
[32:22] completely understand because it's a
[32:23] 80page white paper, but like really
[32:25] important. And so uh, so that's what we
[32:28] we empower them to do. Um now some think
[32:32] tank there's a number of different
[32:33] models and it really depends on the
[32:34] industry and what you're trying to
[32:35] achieve. I think like if you were like
[32:38] you know focused on like uh volcanoes at
[32:42] the deepest part of the ocean that no
[32:44] one's explored before and you know how
[32:47] one degree of temperature could change
[32:49] you know the entire ecosystem of you
[32:51] know some special type of whale type of
[32:54] think tank then you're probably more on
[32:56] the like think tank side and less on the
[32:58] advocacy side right uh for us we uh see
[33:03] this as all fairly strategic uh We
[33:06] think, you know, we we let these
[33:08] fellows, we empower them to do
[33:10] independent research. Um, you know,
[33:12] mining companies, for instance, like if
[33:14] you're a mining company, like great job.
[33:16] We love you. But like if you're like,
[33:18] "Here's the research on Bitcoin mining
[33:21] that our mining company did and you put
[33:24] that before Congress, you know, that may
[33:28] or may not hold as much weight as a
[33:30] third-party disinterested nonpartisan
[33:33] nonprofit group that focuses solely on
[33:37] doing research saying, "Hey, here's our
[33:39] paper on this." And uh I think like
[33:41] mining companies understand that. Many
[33:43] of them they they support our work and
[33:45] uh uh we really appreciate that. if you
[33:47] come to our when you come to our summit
[33:49] you'll see many of them sponsored our
[33:50] summit and they're they're like hey go
[33:52] do your thing um keep doing it and we
[33:56] don't you know you know it's not like a
[33:58] a trade group it's like they're like wow
[34:00] you guys are just doing it like go do
[34:01] your thing I don't know where are you
[34:02] finding these people are doing the
[34:03] research fantastic work like love it
[34:05] keep going and we really appreciate that
[34:08] so that's kind of the vibe on the on the
[34:10] think tank side and then what we do it's
[34:13] a little unique uh we we have the whole
[34:16] advocacy side. We have a government
[34:17] affairs team. We have a public policy
[34:19] team. Uh we engage with Capitol Hill in
[34:22] a number of different ways, elected
[34:24] officials and staffers, and we say,
[34:27] "Hey, let's do this baseline education.
[34:28] Like, what do you need to know about
[34:30] Bitcoin? What are you working on? Oh,
[34:31] you're working on this, and you know,
[34:33] does Bitcoin fit into this or what do
[34:36] your constituents think? What are they
[34:37] saying about Bitcoin? Oh, have you
[34:38] thought about this?" And so, we help
[34:40] them help sort of form and shape uh
[34:43] their their understanding. And then
[34:46] we'll bring in these white papers, this
[34:49] re research, and it helps us have
[34:51] something to stand on. We're not just
[34:52] saying things. We have thousands of
[34:54] hours of uh very smart, talented, like
[34:59] check all the boxes of everything you
[35:01] need to in Washington in order for
[35:02] someone to take you seriously as a
[35:04] research program caliber uh white
[35:07] papers. And we're like, and this is
[35:08] where we're getting all this. We're not
[35:10] just saying that, you know, Bitcoin is
[35:14] really important uh for the United
[35:16] States, especially from like a national
[35:19] security nation, state power network
[35:21] type of thing. We have been writing
[35:24] about this for four years. Matt Pines
[35:27] wrote a white paper on this like
[35:29] literally like four years ago. It was
[35:30] the first white paper we published. And
[35:32] now boom, uh reality has kind of caught
[35:35] up. US, China, lots of things go
[35:38] tectonic plates shifting and we're
[35:41] seeing yeah this is this is pretty
[35:43] important. Um so that's kind of how it
[35:46] works uh like behind the scenes. Our
[35:49] mission is really simple like we want to
[35:51] educate uh Washington DC on Bitcoin.
[35:54] We've always said like our, you know,
[35:56] kind of point of departure like when
[35:58] Grant and David first started BPI, it
[36:00] was like, "Hey, we think one day
[36:03] Washington DC is going to take Bitcoin
[36:05] seriously." Like there's going to come a
[36:07] day and I think if you didn't think
[36:09] that, then you don't believe in Bitcoin.
[36:10] You don't believe Bitcoin was going to
[36:12] be successful. Uh because if Bitcoin's
[36:14] going to be successful, then eventually
[36:16] the largest nation in the world's going
[36:18] to say, "What's that all about? What's
[36:20] going on with that?" Uh, anyone who
[36:22] thinks that Bitcoin could become
[36:23] successful and the United States
[36:25] government was just going to be like,
[36:25] "Ah, you know, fifth largest asset in
[36:28] the world. Cow, we'll figure it out
[36:29] later." You're out of your mind. That's
[36:30] just not how it works. And uh, maybe you
[36:33] wish it worked that way. And that's
[36:34] fine. But it doesn't. And so, you know,
[36:36] at some point that gnat flying around
[36:38] the head of nation states, they're going
[36:41] to say, "I'm tired of this stupid fly."
[36:44] Like, and or they're going to think,
[36:46] "Oh, what an interesting fly. I wonder
[36:48] what it and so we figured if they're
[36:52] going to take it seriously one way or
[36:54] the other, let's start working now
[36:57] before Bitcoin's uh you know the number
[37:00] one asset um number one market cap, you
[37:03] know, largest asset in the planet
[37:04] surpasses gold. Let's go ahead and start
[37:07] uh educating a little now so that we
[37:10] have allies, so we have people that
[37:12] understand it. The worst case scenario
[37:14] to me, Walker, I'm curious what you
[37:16] think, uh, is well, like one of the
[37:19] worst case scenarios. There are many
[37:20] worst case scenarios like in the world.
[37:23] But with regards to Bitcoin and the
[37:26] government, the worst case scenario
[37:28] would be Bitcoin just boom out of
[37:31] nowhere, you know, 10 trillion market
[37:34] cap or whatever or, you know, blows past
[37:36] gold and a bunch of people get in the
[37:40] room and watch and they're like, "What's
[37:42] up with this Bitcoin thing?" and nobody
[37:43] knows and they're like, "Yeah, I heard
[37:45] it's like a scam or I heard, you know, I
[37:47] remember the FTX thing, like that was a
[37:49] total rugpool." Um, I don't know, but
[37:52] like this is endangering the entire
[37:54] financial system. Like, we got to kill
[37:55] it. Like, we got to figure it out. We
[37:57] need to ban mining, whatever they would
[37:59] want to do. And you say, "Well, they
[38:01] couldn't kill Bitcoin." Probably not,
[38:03] but they sure as hell could try. It sure
[38:06] wouldn't be fun in the meantime, right?
[38:08] And so, that's what we want to avoid. We
[38:10] want people to, you know, have their
[38:11] like, "Oh, yeah. I've actually met with
[38:13] uh many Bitcoiners over the last, you
[38:15] know, 5 10 years and I think this is
[38:18] actually really important and I'm glad
[38:19] it's successful and I actually think the
[38:21] United States I think we benefit from
[38:23] this. I think the world benefits from
[38:25] this and here's why. And if we want to
[38:27] talk more in depth, like let me bring
[38:28] some people in who know a lot about it.
[38:30] That's where we want to be at. I I would
[38:32] I would agree that that would be a a
[38:35] massive risk because you're right. I
[38:36] mean, can a single government
[38:38] instituting uh prohibitive Bitcoin
[38:40] policies kill Bitcoin? No, of course
[38:41] not. Like, and we've got a great example
[38:43] of this in the China mining ban, right?
[38:45] Oh, oh, no. Hash rate goes off a cliff
[38:47] overnight after like, wasn't that like
[38:49] their 10th ban? But this time they were
[38:51] super serious, I guess. Um, and hash
[38:53] rate went off a cliff, but you know
[38:54] what? That hash rate came right back and
[38:56] a lot of it found its way to America, to
[38:57] Texas, to other states. Great. Thanks,
[39:00] China. Like, bad move for you. Great
[39:02] news for us. uh so they wouldn't be able
[39:05] to kill it, but they can certainly make
[39:06] it a pain in the ass to hold and use
[39:11] Bitcoin in a way that respects the law.
[39:13] And you might say, well, you know, I
[39:14] don't need to respect the law. And
[39:16] that's fine. You can do whatever you
[39:17] want. The point is that the government
[39:19] can either make it uh very difficult for
[39:23] you to do things that are of course
[39:25] within uh your just let's say natural
[39:28] rights like to have private property to
[39:31] trans you know to have privacy to
[39:32] transact anonymously or pseudonmously
[39:35] but they can also make that they can
[39:37] make that really difficult or they can
[39:39] put laws in place which actually protect
[39:42] your rights to do that. Like people
[39:43] forget that the point of laws is to
[39:46] protect you from the government, not for
[39:48] the government that the government
[39:49] doesn't give you rights. But they can
[39:52] try to prohibit your rights by making
[39:54] terrible laws. So again, it's like which
[39:56] would you rather have? Would you rather
[39:58] have good laws that protect your rights
[40:01] or would you rather have bad laws that
[40:04] infringe upon your rights? Because those
[40:06] are basically your two options. and or
[40:08] just somewhere in the middle, I guess,
[40:10] which is just really garbage,
[40:12] over-the-top uh you know, bureaucratic
[40:14] laws that just make it a pain in the
[40:16] butt to do absolutely anything. So,
[40:18] yeah. And, you know, and I'm I think
[40:20] that you guys have obviously shifted the
[40:22] needle or you've moved the needle to a
[40:24] huge extent. The fact that uh Vice
[40:27] President Vance gave a direct shout out
[40:30] to you guys at the Bitcoin conference in
[40:32] Vegas, like that that was pretty huge.
[40:34] Can you can you talk about that a little
[40:35] bit because that might must have been
[40:36] quite a moment for you guys. Yeah, it
[40:39] was I mean it was a it was a really cool
[40:42] moment. Uh we were all on the live desk
[40:44] actually uh me, Matt Pines, and Zack
[40:46] Shapiro uh before the vice president
[40:49] spoke and kind of you know what are we
[40:51] expecting to hear? You know, kind of the
[40:52] whole news desk thing and uh and we were
[40:55] sitting listening. We're like this good
[40:57] speech, you know, and he kind of went
[40:59] here and he started hitting some things.
[41:00] We're like, man, he's really throwing
[41:01] some pain makers. And then he was like,
[41:03] "Yeah, you know," and thanks to the work
[41:05] of people like the Bitcoin Policy
[41:06] Institute and we were just like, we all
[41:09] looked at each other like, "Did did one
[41:11] of you meet with his team or something?"
[41:13] He was like, "No, we have no idea." Uh,
[41:15] and so it was it was really cool. And I
[41:18] think, yeah, I mean, it was like it was
[41:20] a cool moment. It was it was an awesome
[41:22] moment. Um, but I think what's really
[41:24] neat about it to me uh uh is is that
[41:28] within the context of his whole speech.
[41:30] So he was just driving nails, especially
[41:33] the second half uh talking about Bitcoin
[41:35] being a hedge against inflation.
[41:36] Actually, I have a couple notes. Uh
[41:38] yeah. Can you like Yeah. walk through
[41:40] kind of like what what jumped out at you
[41:43] and at the BPI team from that speech
[41:45] that you were like, "Okay, this is Yeah.
[41:47] Like great. This is what you should be
[41:48] saying." Yeah. He so he kind of went
[41:51] kind of getting his, you know, getting
[41:53] his mojo, you know, kind of like fired
[41:54] Gary Gendzer like three or four times in
[41:56] a row and like kept because Trump had
[41:57] the big laugh about it, you know, when
[42:00] he spoke in in Nashville and kind of
[42:02] benefits of Bitcoin kind of just like
[42:04] top level vague and like what you would
[42:06] expect. And then about halfway through
[42:09] it kind of seemed like he maybe, you
[42:11] know, he kind of just got got into it,
[42:14] maybe went off script a little bit. Uh,
[42:16] and so, uh, especially with the shout
[42:17] out to us. I don't think his speech
[42:19] writer put that in there, but, uh, I
[42:21] don't know. That's just a guess. But,
[42:23] yeah, he was like, you know, here's like
[42:24] like Bitcoin's super important. Like, it
[42:27] gives us gives people expanded access to
[42:29] banking. Uh, Bitcoin's a hedge against
[42:32] uh, central government control, a hedge
[42:35] against inflation, private sector
[42:37] censorship, debanking, like this. I'm
[42:40] like, okay, this guy gets it a little
[42:42] bit. uh he started calling Bitcoiners
[42:44] digital pioneers, which was like, you
[42:46] know, I don't think he's the first one
[42:48] to say that, but it was like pretty
[42:49] cool. Uh really cool way to describe it.
[42:53] Um he talked about the desire to to of
[42:56] his team and like DC should be listening
[42:58] to our industry and learning from us.
[43:02] And I think that's probably where he
[43:03] mentioned BPI was like people like BPI
[43:07] are helping us with that. uh just being
[43:09] a constant resource and like staying
[43:11] very focused on Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[43:13] only, which we're one of the only groups
[43:15] that can say that. Uh we're proud of
[43:18] that. We wear that like a metal around
[43:19] our necks like Yeah. And it's always
[43:21] going to be that way. Like we are about
[43:23] Bitcoin. We're Bitcoin focused. We don't
[43:25] we don't we don't really stray outside
[43:27] that. We may talk about CBDC's. We may
[43:28] talk about stables, but like you know
[43:30] because of legislation and different
[43:32] things going on, I think those are on
[43:34] the table and but really like Bitcoin is
[43:37] the only thing that matters and and
[43:38] here's why. Uh it's not the crypto
[43:41] policy institute. Let's just say it sure
[43:43] as hell isn't. Uh and then uh he said
[43:46] that Bitcoin and Bitcoiners deserve the
[43:49] respect and support from the government.
[43:52] uh which you know I agree with since we
[43:55] elected them and put them there and pay
[43:57] for them to be there. But you know uh
[44:00] but yeah for a politician to say that I
[44:02] think is is great. Um versus he said
[44:06] being torn by down by bureaucracy
[44:09] and uh and he mentioned the whole like
[44:13] you know operation choke point two 2.0
[44:16] Oh, being taken down, promises made,
[44:18] promises kept, and and then he
[44:19] encouraged everybody to be involved in
[44:20] the 2026 uh campaigns and engage there.
[44:25] Um, and you know, to your point, I'm put
[44:29] he didn't say this in his speech, uh,
[44:30] but he alluded to it, and I think what
[44:32] you just said, like
[44:34] policy being focused on, uh, you know,
[44:40] like protecting your rights. And to some
[44:42] listeners, they may say, well, like, I
[44:44] don't like I don't need the government
[44:46] to tell me I can do XYZ. I can. I don't
[44:49] I don't want their I don't want them to
[44:50] give me permission to do it. I'm a free
[44:52] person. And I'm like, I get it, man.
[44:54] Hey, I'm right there with you. But like,
[44:56] if you look at what's just happened to
[44:58] like non-custodial services, they're
[45:00] getting like thrown in prison. So, you
[45:03] don't need them to tell you, but like I
[45:04] also don't want to move to China, you
[45:07] know, and I don't want to get thrown in
[45:08] prison for like uh coding and making
[45:11] like building a website. And so, they're
[45:14] they're wrong about that, but like let's
[45:16] go ahead and fix the law and like spell
[45:17] it out a little bit, right? Um, if
[45:19] you've ever been in a lawsuit, thank God
[45:20] I haven't been, you know, it can be not
[45:23] fair or it cannot be right, but like you
[45:25] better defend yourself or you're going
[45:26] to lose the lawsuit. And that's how it
[45:28] is with the government. So anyway, uh,
[45:31] little tangent. Uh, but the other thing
[45:33] about JD's speech, man, and uh, this may
[45:37] be obvious uh, to some people, but some
[45:39] people kind of was talking about this
[45:40] and I thought it was interesting. The
[45:43] the thing that struck me the most was
[45:44] like this is the vice president. They're
[45:46] like, "Ah, you know, President Trump
[45:48] spoke last summer. Now we got the number
[45:50] two guy." President Trump didn't speak
[45:52] last summer. That was that was a guy
[45:54] running for president. That was a
[45:56] campaign stop. Like Nashville, he was
[45:58] running for president and he was
[45:59] campaigning all over the place,
[46:00] barnstorming across the country. And I
[46:03] don't blame him. Hey, 30,000 people in
[46:05] Nashville, let's pop in, rally the base
[46:07] a little bit. And I think he what he
[46:09] encountered was like, "Oh, these people
[46:11] are a little different." like the whole
[46:13] Gary Gensler thing, he didn't expect
[46:15] anybody to applaud. That's why he
[46:16] repeated it three times. He's like,
[46:17] "This is awesome." Like, "Yeah, let's
[46:19] go. I'm going to fire him right now."
[46:21] And uh and so, you know, it doesn't mean
[46:24] it wasn't like important and a watershed
[46:26] moment. It absolutely was. But he was a
[46:30] guy running for office and props. He
[46:33] kept campaign promises and did all the
[46:35] kind of things he said he was going to
[46:37] do. But at Vegas, this was a sitting
[46:40] vice president. this guy's not running
[46:41] for office. He's not campaigning right
[46:43] now. And so why is he there? Well, I
[46:48] think it kind of speaks for itself. I
[46:49] think he I think he meant what he said.
[46:51] I think he was there for a purpose. And
[46:53] uh and so I think that's the most like
[46:56] incredible thing about it. The other
[46:59] side is he is sitting last I checked
[47:02] plus 1,000 odds uh or plus 300 odds on
[47:06] being the next or maybe it was 250. plus
[47:09] 250 plus 300 30% odds against the field
[47:14] of being the next president of the
[47:15] United States. Next closest is plus
[47:18] 10,000. Gavin Newsome,
[47:21] AOC, Don Jr. uh are the next closest.
[47:26] They're all plus one. So he's like 30%.
[47:28] Everybody else is like 5%. So you have
[47:32] likely
[47:33] I mean you have the current vice
[47:35] president and the probable uh future
[47:38] president. So you've got two then four
[47:41] potentially a 10year runway here uh
[47:46] where you have someone in the White
[47:48] House who gets it and appreciates
[47:50] Bitcoin. I think that's a huge win. We
[47:52] can't obviously BPI take credit uh for
[47:55] that and I'm not trying to. I'm just
[47:57] saying I think it's awesome. Uh for us,
[47:59] like we take meetings with anyone who'll
[48:02] meet with us. We don't just work with
[48:04] Republicans. We're a nonpartisan think
[48:06] tank, but we can't make uh people who
[48:08] won't meet with us meet with us. Like we
[48:10] can't we can't educate Elizabeth Warren,
[48:13] you know. I'd love to meet with
[48:14] Elizabeth Warren. I would love it. I sit
[48:16] down with her tomorrow and uh explain
[48:18] why I think, you know, what I think. Uh
[48:21] and she, you know, I'd love to meet with
[48:22] her team and hopefully uh show show them
[48:25] the light a little bit. That'd be a
[48:26] funny meeting. Uh but it'd be a blast.
[48:28] You know, why not? And that's the
[48:30] posture we take. That goes a long way in
[48:33] DC because most people aren't like that.
[48:35] Yeah. I mean, I think that people uh
[48:39] people need to remember that like
[48:41] Bitcoin is inherently political because
[48:44] money is inherently political. But being
[48:47] political does not make it partisan. You
[48:50] can try to make it partisan. You can try
[48:51] to put your whatever partisan bent on it
[48:54] you want. this is a, you know, a red
[48:56] team thing, not a blue team thing. But
[48:58] the reality is Bitcoin doesn't care.
[49:00] Money will always be political
[49:02] necessarily. So, but that does not make
[49:05] it partisan. And honestly, I mean, like,
[49:08] you are only hurting yourself as either
[49:11] a candidate or a political party by
[49:14] being either ignorant or anti- Bitcoin.
[49:17] And I think that that's like that is
[49:20] showing to be very true and will
[49:21] continue to like that's only going to
[49:23] ramp up because Bitcoiners are becoming
[49:26] an increasingly dominant uh economic and
[49:29] political force. Like you don't want to
[49:32] have that against you. You'd rather have
[49:34] that for you. And I think politicians
[49:36] are starting to wake up to that. Have
[49:37] you seen any sort of uh positive
[49:39] developments on the Democratic side of
[49:41] the aisle versus like we know that
[49:43] there's a good number of very vocal
[49:45] Republicans who are, you know, pro
[49:46] Bitcoin. What about on the Democratic
[49:49] side? Are you seeing more movement
[49:50] there? Yeah, I think so. Uh we have
[49:53] Yeah. Congressman Torres speaking at the
[49:55] summit uh here in a couple weeks.
[49:57] Congressman uh or uh uh Ro Connor spoke
[50:01] at uh our March event. And I think, you
[50:05] know, I think a lot increasing number of
[50:07] Democrat congressmen get it. Staffs get
[50:10] it. There's some, you know, some really
[50:12] uh brilliant people on that side of the
[50:15] aisle. They get a bad rap for some of
[50:16] the Elizabeth Warren of the world that
[50:19] just uh you know, almost like, you know,
[50:21] it's almost like a bad joke. Uh refuse
[50:24] to understand uh some things. But uh
[50:28] yeah, I don't think I don't see Bitcoin
[50:30] as a political football uh to be kicked
[50:32] back and forth depending on who's in
[50:34] charge. I think it's ridiculous. It's
[50:36] like like I you know you know money is
[50:39] political uh but not partisan. It's like
[50:41] saying you're it's like which party
[50:43] likes music, you know? Uh I don't know
[50:46] like what what even how does that even
[50:48] work? I'm sure at one point there was a
[50:49] political party who was like we don't
[50:51] need any more you don't need this music
[50:53] running around uh or uh you know the
[50:56] internet like who if you if you tie your
[51:00] whole existence or your whole like
[51:02] platform to like this internet it's uh
[51:05] ridiculous. it's going to be the end of
[51:06] us. You know, it might be, they may have
[51:08] been right, but uh the internet, you
[51:10] know, it's it's uh it's bad for our
[51:12] country to be to lead when it comes to
[51:15] the internet. In the early 90s, there
[51:16] was actually a uh
[51:19] I was doing a research project on like
[51:21] uh you know, uh some messaging and like
[51:25] I was trying to look at uh other think
[51:28] tanks and advocacy groups that were like
[51:30] similar to ours and like uh you know,
[51:33] how they were successful and sorts of
[51:34] things. uh last year and I came across
[51:37] the Internet Policy Institute of the
[51:40] early 90s.
[51:42] Their mission and vision statements were
[51:44] like eerily similar to ours. And I'm
[51:47] sure you know some of the guys have
[51:49] heard of them and stuff, but like it
[51:50] wasn't like we were trying to cut. It
[51:52] was like no, it's very similar. And they
[51:54] were like, yeah, you know, it felt like
[51:56] they're taking crazy pills. And I'm sure
[51:58] we felt like this. you know, you have
[51:59] and I have uh as Bitcoiners, you're
[52:02] like, "This internet thing, this is a
[52:04] huge deal, man. It's going to take over
[52:05] the world. Like, what are you, you guys
[52:07] aren't listening to me. Like, the
[52:08] internet is coming. The internet age is
[52:11] here, you know?" And politicians are
[52:14] like, "Is this stupid internet guys
[52:17] again? They're always trying to get me
[52:18] to speak at their thing, like, you know,
[52:21] get, you know, let's" And I'm sure it
[52:23] was similar. uh it reading their stuff
[52:25] it was just like I felt like I was
[52:27] reading my own diary and I know
[52:29] everybody talks about the bit Bitcoin is
[52:31] like the early days of the internet but
[52:33] it really was like when you read these
[52:34] think tanks they're just trying to
[52:36] convince like these elected leaders of
[52:40] something that they can't comprehend yet
[52:42] and they're like I just need you to
[52:44] trust me man like the United States
[52:46] needs to take this seriously and
[52:48] thankfully we did look at us now you
[52:50] know um we led the free world you I can
[52:53] imagine if we didn't there's some
[52:55] alternative versions of history that
[52:57] would have you know potentially been
[52:58] really troubling.
[53:00] And I think I mean that that is such a
[53:02] great uh uh analogy for or you know
[53:05] comparison for Bitcoin because it's like
[53:08] again uh as an American obviously like I
[53:11] I I love my country. I don't uh love my
[53:14] government. I don't think you should
[53:15] like love your government. You should be
[53:17] cautious of your government. you should
[53:19] uh generally treat it with uh with some
[53:22] scorn, derision, and a healthy dose of
[53:25] skepticism uh because ultimately an
[53:28] overblown and bloated state apparatus is
[53:30] only going to lead to totalitarianism.
[53:33] But that being said, I love America and
[53:35] I love the American people and I love
[53:36] the American idea and I love the
[53:38] American Constitution
[53:40] and I think that that is a really
[53:42] powerful force for good in the world. uh
[53:44] what the American government has often
[53:46] done around the world is often not a
[53:48] force for good. But uh that does not
[53:51] mean America as a nation is is in any
[53:53] way irredeemable. And we also I mean if
[53:56] you there's a lot of places around the
[53:58] world that are uh that respect your
[54:00] property rights and your personal uh
[54:03] autonomy a hell of a lot less. And so I
[54:06] think if there's a place that is most,
[54:08] let's say, ideologically and culturally
[54:10] aligned with Bitcoin right now, it is
[54:12] the United States of America. And I
[54:15] think it's good for people to remember
[54:16] that. And again, we want it to stay that
[54:18] way. And so that's why I think like I
[54:20] I'm curious, you know, of the
[54:22] initiatives that you guys are working on
[54:23] now, uh, you know, what do you, you
[54:26] know, what are kind of your key focus
[54:28] areas at the moment? uh how how do you
[54:31] even decide what parts of what parts of
[54:34] this to tackle because obviously there's
[54:35] a lot that goes into Bitcoin? Where do
[54:38] you guys apply the majority of your
[54:40] focus at the moment?
[54:42] Yeah. Yeah, that's a big question. Um
[54:46] and something we consistently, you know,
[54:49] evaluate and iterate on. Um you know,
[54:53] I'll just say to well, you you kind of
[54:55] talking about our country. I think we as
[54:59] it's funny like I don't know if you're
[55:00] experiencing this uh with kids and
[55:02] having a family and everything you know
[55:04] we always talk about like this
[55:05] generation or my generation we have an
[55:08] opportunity you know I see it as like we
[55:09] have an opportunity to improve or
[55:11] degrade our uh our freedoms and uh
[55:16] improve or degrade our our country and
[55:19] leave it better or worse for like our
[55:21] kids and our grandkids and whatever. And
[55:24] I think just like that doesn't mean that
[55:27] everything's perfect. Like everything is
[55:28] obviously not perfect in the United
[55:30] States, especially with our government.
[55:32] And we could have a whole you and I
[55:34] could just sit and have a whole uh
[55:36] three-hour podcast uh about that. But I
[55:40] think the fact that we can either
[55:43] improve or degrade it is very very
[55:46] valuable. And that's why I love my
[55:49] country is because I do have the
[55:51] opportunity to, you know, it's easy. No.
[55:54] Uh, impossible, no, to improve things
[55:58] and change things. And, uh, and you got
[56:00] to work your ass off sometimes and you
[56:02] still lose, but you can do it. And it's
[56:04] very possible. And so that's uh, that's
[56:07] what I like. That's why I'm going to be,
[56:09] you know, blasting fireworks, bottle
[56:11] rockets on the 4th of July with a tank
[56:12] top on, brother. So, you know, I uh I
[56:16] I'm that's that's where I land. Um with
[56:19] BPI,
[56:21] we um I think we have an advantage. Like
[56:24] we are we're in a really like sweet spot
[56:27] as an organization. We have beefed up
[56:30] enough, we've grown enough that we can,
[56:32] you know, kind of handle a number of
[56:35] things simultaneously. Whereas there
[56:37] were years there were times
[56:39] not uh I mean recently uh like last year
[56:43] where we had to really pick and choose
[56:46] uh it we had to make hard decisions on
[56:48] what we're going to focus on because we
[56:49] had such limited bandwidth. Um we were
[56:51] small and we're still small uh but we
[56:54] have increased our bandwidth. We're up
[56:56] to a dozen employees and so uh and I'm
[56:59] really proud of that growth and you know
[57:01] eternally grateful for the people who
[57:03] helped us get there. Uh, but we can take
[57:06] on a few things and do them the right
[57:09] way. I think that's the most important
[57:10] thing to us is like whatever we do, we
[57:13] want to blow it out of the water and
[57:16] that's how you earn a good reputation in
[57:20] the uh capital, you know, of our
[57:22] country. Uh, you want to stand out. And
[57:25] so, one big thing we're doing we
[57:27] mentioned is the Bitcoin policy summit.
[57:29] We've done this three years in a row. It
[57:31] was a crazy idea the first time. uh you
[57:34] know uh we did it really quickly and it
[57:36] came together and okay policy summit
[57:38] advance great. What is it like a Bitcoin
[57:40] conference in DC? No, it's completely
[57:42] different. This is suits and ties. It
[57:45] looks like you're like it looks boring
[57:47] to most people. You're like oh policy.
[57:49] Oh my gosh. But I think it is
[57:51] fascinating.
[57:53] We have Bitcoiners on stage and some
[57:56] elected officials. But the goal of this
[57:58] is to educate the masses that bring in
[58:02] hundreds of staffers to from a
[58:06] kindergarten to a, you know, uh, junior
[58:09] 3000 level graduate level understanding
[58:12] of Bitcoin, up and down that spectrum,
[58:15] there's something for you there. Um, I
[58:18] think for most people who kind of have,
[58:20] they're like, I don't really know. I'm
[58:22] like supposed to talk about digital
[58:23] assets with my job, but you know, I'm
[58:26] getting uh you know uh misinformation or
[58:30] like mixed signals or I'm hearing from
[58:32] this group and this group and I don't
[58:33] know what to think. Well, why don't you
[58:34] come learn about just Bitcoin for a day?
[58:36] Let's just let's just isolate one type
[58:40] of asset and let's just talk about it's
[58:41] the biggest one by a long shot. And
[58:43] you've heard what about it? Nothing. Uh
[58:47] it's what 60% of the market cap of all
[58:50] digital assets of you know all crypto.
[58:53] Uh and you've heard you know what 3% of
[58:57] everything you've heard in DC was about
[58:59] Bitcoin. That sounds weird. I wonder
[59:01] why. H wonder. See almost seems like
[59:03] others are spending a lot of money on
[59:05] marketing. Uh so anyway uh
[59:09] uh I love this man. I love uh talking
[59:11] with you about this. This is this is
[59:13] fun. But I and I get to do all these
[59:14] little tangent and safe space for
[59:17] tangents always. I can I can always I
[59:19] can keep that promise. I'm a I am your
[59:22] I'm your guy uh for tangents. So, we did
[59:26] the summit and we had a bunch of and
[59:27] they're like, "Man, this was so great. I
[59:30] just get to sit and hear about Bitcoin
[59:31] for a day." We explained mining. We
[59:35] brought in like professors. We brought
[59:37] in mining companies and we put them on
[59:39] stage. We're like, "Explain to these
[59:41] like, you know, explain to Washington DC
[59:42] what mining is, why it's important.
[59:45] Oh, all the BS stuff you hear about
[59:47] mining, like talk about that, too. Oh,
[59:51] um, money laundering. Does somebody want
[59:53] to Yeah, okay, let's get the experts.
[59:54] Just talk about moneyaundering. Hey,
[59:56] most people say Bitcoin's used for
[59:58] moneyaundering.
[59:59] That's not true. Here's why. All right,
[60:03] we do this all day. Um, human rights. We
[60:06] holler at our friends at the HRF, Alex
[60:09] Gladstein, and all them. and we're like,
[60:10] "Bring a bunch of human rights activists
[60:12] and talk about how they use Bitcoin."
[60:14] And we're just blowing minds. Uh we're
[60:17] just blowing people's minds. They're
[60:18] like, "I had no idea." So, we're like,
[60:20] "All right, let's run it back." The next
[60:21] year,
[60:23] uh or the first year it was like FTX had
[60:25] just collapsed. So, the the funny thing,
[60:27] I should have said this earlier, uh was
[60:29] just not warmed up yet. I joined BPI and
[60:33] it was like you know married like hey
[60:35] I'm doing the Bitcoin think tank I'm
[60:38] gonna work like what's that you know you
[60:41] you still have to ask me that right and
[60:43] you're in the like imagine my spouse who
[60:45] like is you know she doesn't know what
[60:47] any of those words are she she you know
[60:50] she's brilliant but like she's like what
[60:51] are you doing I was like I don't know
[60:53] this sounds awesome she's like do it
[60:54] this sounds cool you're you're excited
[60:55] about it go for it so I'm fortunate
[60:57] there uh but uh but yeah I it like I did
[61:01] this got this job like I'm going all in
[61:04] a month later like FTX collapses and and
[61:08] I remember cuz I was at Pacific Bitcoin
[61:10] and uh and it was just like well
[61:14] here we go uh you know and uh it was a
[61:17] host it's a perfect time um to to come
[61:20] over in hindsight because I we got to
[61:23] build during a bear uh which is I know a
[61:26] lot of people but we did and uh we did
[61:29] build and you had to
[61:31] you had to kind of like soulsearch like
[61:33] what's really important, you know, what
[61:35] are we really trying to do? And so we
[61:36] did the summit like FTX collapsed.
[61:38] Everybody thinks Bitcoin's a scam. This
[61:40] is what our website said on the summit.
[61:42] Everybody thinks Bitcoin's a scam, you
[61:44] know, uh you know, everybody lost
[61:47] millions of dollars. Like who's to
[61:49] blame? Is it Bitcoin? Like come to the
[61:52] summit and find out. And uh and
[61:54] everybody did. It's like we have nothing
[61:56] to hide. That's the cool part. That's
[61:59] what makes it like uh simple, not easy,
[62:02] but like really simple to advocate and
[62:04] to meet with people. It's because we're
[62:06] right, you know, like we're not lying
[62:09] about anything. We're not full of it.
[62:11] Like we are telling the truth and we're
[62:15] like, "Yeah, I mean bit like look, like
[62:18] you know, inflation's through the roof
[62:20] and has been and always will be. Um your
[62:23] money is becoming worthless.
[62:25] Everybody's aware of this. like
[62:27] something is lots of things are broken
[62:31] beyond repair. And hey, check this out.
[62:34] Like this is a really cool way of uh of
[62:38] doing money. And this is like really
[62:40] interesting. And there we're just
[62:42] beginning to tap into uh you know, kind
[62:44] of the possibilities of like how uh you
[62:48] know, mining is going to tie into our
[62:50] grid and all these sorts of things. But
[62:52] like there's all kinds of cool stuff
[62:54] happening here, boys. is like come on
[62:55] over like learn about and we're right
[62:58] like we're honest and so it makes it a
[63:00] lot easier um in a number of ways
[63:02] because people can pick up on that. Uh
[63:04] politicians especially, they're the best
[63:06] at, you know, they're going to they know
[63:07] if you're full of it, man. Uh they're
[63:09] around people like that all day long,
[63:11] their entire lives. And some of them
[63:13] might be that way themselves, right? So,
[63:15] uh so yeah, we um that's what we do,
[63:18] man. And uh that's one big thing. The
[63:21] summit, uh we have like 600 people, 700
[63:23] people coming. Uh we have 10 elected
[63:25] officials. We have the uh deputy
[63:27] director of the CIA has come to speak at
[63:29] our summit. Saw that. Uh which is going
[63:31] to be sick. And who knows what that
[63:33] guy's gonna say, right? Maybe they
[63:35] announce they invented it, right? That's
[63:36] the announcement. Oh, that would that
[63:39] would be that'd be something. So, I
[63:40] better bring a burner phone also. Just
[63:42] I'm just going to assume the you know.
[63:44] Yeah, that's probably burner. That's a
[63:46] good idea. That's a good idea. Um, yeah.
[63:50] So, we're we're uh we you know, we're
[63:54] going to blow this out of the water and
[63:55] we live stream it. We get millions of
[63:57] people watch it. So it's a great like we
[64:00] see it as like we're building our like a
[64:02] megaphone and you can shout through that
[64:04] for like a couple days and then out of
[64:07] that we have you know there's a lot of
[64:09] publicity there's a lot of press there's
[64:11] a lot of doors that open to to new uh
[64:14] conversations with like oh yeah so and
[64:16] so was talking about this I haven't met
[64:18] with you guys yet but I I really need to
[64:21] um you know government agencies come and
[64:23] they're like it's not just Bitcoin or
[64:26] not just us and not just or maybe it's
[64:29] nothing to do with us. Maybe it's one of
[64:31] our speakers that they're like, "Oh, I
[64:33] really engage. I you know, I'm working
[64:35] on something I need to talk to you
[64:36] about." And now they're working with the
[64:37] Bitcoin industry. And so it's it's just
[64:40] a way to open so many doors in like a
[64:43] couple days. It's a lot of work. I know
[64:44] you've been involved with events and uh
[64:47] it's a lot of work. It's a heavy lift,
[64:48] but it's worth every ounce of it. And
[64:50] that's why we're running it back. I
[64:52] think on the other the policy priority
[64:54] side um to hit that like our focus is
[64:57] the strategic bitcoin reserve of course
[65:00] uh I mentioned like non-custodial tools
[65:03] uh self-custody like just there's a lot
[65:06] of legislation floating around bitcoin
[65:08] act uh we're keeping an eye on genius
[65:11] and market structure stuff as well and
[65:13] and monitoring that like making sure
[65:16] that um there's the p there's like the
[65:19] passive legislative monitoring like, you
[65:22] know, you're you're scanning the uh you
[65:25] know, scanning the road for like
[65:27] landmines. Like there's nothing here
[65:28] that's like super dangerous, right? Like
[65:31] that's more defensive and passive on the
[65:34] policy side. And Zach Shapiro is like
[65:36] fantastic at that. Like he's like a bird
[65:38] dog, man. He's like, "Wait, they're
[65:40] trying to do this thing, man." And so,
[65:42] uh, so that's the the passive side and
[65:44] there's the active side like, hm,
[65:48] maybe, um, maybe a senator, a
[65:50] congressman comes and says,
[65:52] I want to, you know, I'll just make
[65:55] something up. Um, I want to like,
[65:59] you know, kind of do a bill of rights
[66:01] for non-custodial tools or whatever.
[66:03] Like, what would that look like? We're
[66:04] like, well, here's how I'd write it. You
[66:06] know, here's how I would phrase that.
[66:08] And so, you know, we're kind of the the
[66:10] experts in the room that can kind of
[66:11] help advise and give feedback and have
[66:13] those off thereord conversations. And
[66:15] again, that's not a real story. It's
[66:17] just an example of something uh that
[66:19] could happen and be cool if some of that
[66:22] work. Yeah, it would be cool. Uh hey,
[66:24] anybody wants to build a like uh you
[66:26] know, bill of rights like that, it'd be
[66:28] great. I'm sure somebody probably is
[66:29] working on it. um whether it's, you
[66:32] know, policy priorities for offices,
[66:34] we're um they kind of know what they
[66:36] want to do and we kind of help them um
[66:39] you know, that's all we think about.
[66:40] They're working on policy for everything
[66:43] all at once. And so, uh in that sense,
[66:46] you know, like I mentioned lobbyists
[66:48] earlier, they're the educated experts on
[66:50] something. Um now they're going out like
[66:53] pushing on specific bills and like
[66:55] taking people out to dinner, doing all
[66:56] that kind of thing. We don't do that.
[66:58] But in that way, we are similar as
[67:00] advocates uh and as reliable resources
[67:03] that they're like, "Oh, Bitcoin that
[67:06] came up. Let's go talk to BPI. Those
[67:07] guys will let us know if this is legit
[67:09] or not. Uh they can kind of let me know
[67:11] and kind of help me out. I can bounce
[67:13] ideas with them. I know they're not
[67:14] going to go like tell the press about
[67:15] it." So, that's kind of the role we like
[67:17] to fill uh on that side and just being a
[67:20] reliable, trusted third party um that
[67:23] has your best interest in mind. But we
[67:25] are dieh hard for our uh for our
[67:27] industry and we're going to fight tooth
[67:29] and nail to to improve outcomes for
[67:31] Bitcoiners and Bitcoin, you know,
[67:33] companies and mining companies in
[67:34] America because we think it's important
[67:36] that we can like we talked about
[67:38] continue to exercise our freedoms. We
[67:39] think those freedoms should be expanded.
[67:41] And then we make the case on the other
[67:43] way like, hey, this is good for the
[67:44] United States. Um strategic Bitcoin
[67:48] reserve. Uh I'm sure you know the answer
[67:50] to this, but I'm just going to ask you
[67:51] anyways. Like you know what percent of
[67:54] uh you know of all gold is held in the
[67:56] United States? Have you have you heard
[67:58] these stats? No. No. Educate. Yeah. 10%
[68:02] 10% of of all gold is held in the United
[68:04] States. You know what percent of these
[68:06] are estimates but like roughly I think
[68:07] it's seems to be uh you know what
[68:10] percent of Bitcoin is held in by the in
[68:12] the United States. What percent? So I'm
[68:16] talking industry, individuals,
[68:18] government, whatever, all put together
[68:22] own 10% of the gold supply. Bitcoin is
[68:25] 40%.
[68:26] Wow. Yeah. So if one was going to become
[68:30] more valuable, like become very
[68:32] valuable, which one would be a bigger
[68:35] benefit to the United States? Well,
[68:37] Bitcoin, of course. We got 4x the
[68:39] benefit. So that's pretty compelling
[68:41] argument. If you want to back something
[68:44] with gold or Bitcoin, well, I think you
[68:46] should back it. They just look at them
[68:47] in the same, right? I think Bitcoin is
[68:49] superior in many ways. And we will make
[68:51] the case all day for that. But just like
[68:53] look at the just the just look at the
[68:56] X's, the zeros and ones, man. We have
[68:58] four times more of the Bitcoin than we
[69:00] do the gold. And so for American
[69:02] citizens, for you know, American
[69:04] companies and and the United States
[69:05] government, uh it's like that's easy
[69:07] that's easy pick for me. That's that's
[69:10] massive. Well, can we talk about the SBR
[69:11] a little bit and kind of like where you
[69:13] see where where are we at with that
[69:15] because uh obviously like I I know a lot
[69:19] of the language in that executive order
[69:21] was pulled from some of the work that
[69:23] you guys do at BPI. Uh I did think that
[69:26] that order was nice in that it separated
[69:28] Bitcoin and quote, you know, digital
[69:30] assets very distinctly. Like it was, you
[69:33] know, we're going to uh save all the
[69:35] Bitcoin we have. We're going to acquire
[69:36] more Bitcoin. We won't dispose of any
[69:38] Bitcoin. However, on the digital asset
[69:40] side, we're not going to acquire any. Uh
[69:43] we will dispose of some probably or
[69:44] we'll leave the door open to that. And
[69:46] so, it was nice to see that demarcation
[69:48] there, which you know, it's obviously
[69:50] Bitcoin is not quote crypto. Uh but
[69:53] where where are we at as far as I know
[69:54] they had like initially had like 30 days
[69:56] to to uh for all these agencies to
[69:59] report back and do that? I mean, that 30
[70:00] days has obviously come and gone. I
[70:02] didn't see anything about that. What
[70:05] What updates can you give on that as far
[70:06] as what you know? I don't have a ton of
[70:09] updates unfortunately, Walker. Uh, you
[70:11] know, I wish I I wish I did. Um, it's
[70:14] still very much in flux. Uh, yeah, man.
[70:17] Always like it's, you know, anytime we
[70:20] can help out or chip in um for the
[70:22] administration or anyone on uh language
[70:25] or whatever. It's a it's a you know,
[70:26] it's a privilege to get to do it. And I
[70:29] think with the SPR, I think it's a
[70:30] massive win. First of all, like I think
[70:32] it's a massive win. Uh we got the
[70:34] demarcation language in there like you
[70:36] said between Bitcoin and other types of
[70:38] digital assets and uh I know every some
[70:42] people wanted the buying program. I
[70:43] still think that's on the table. I think
[70:45] you know Senator Lamus' Bitcoin act is
[70:48] is active and moving and that's uh
[70:51] there's a lot in there that I think
[70:52] people are going to be people that are
[70:54] are really excited about. And so I think
[70:56] we I think we need to expand the SPR.
[70:59] Um, I think that, you know, the buying
[71:02] program, um, where the money would come
[71:05] from. I mean, there's a thousand
[71:07] different arguments for that. Um, and
[71:10] and then, you know, disclosure by
[71:12] agencies that's being held up. A lot of
[71:15] people don't completely know why.
[71:17] There's a lot of bureaucratic, you know,
[71:19] like you would expect, uh, swampy type
[71:21] things going on. And uh I think you know
[71:26] we have a rare opportunity and I'm not
[71:29] trying to like wiggle out of your
[71:31] question. Uh but I think the way I see
[71:33] it is we don't know um exactly what's
[71:38] happening and why. Um I think you know
[71:41] Pines can probably dig into that a
[71:42] little bit more uh with you or Shapiro
[71:45] but I think that um we are still in this
[71:50] window of opportunity where we have to
[71:52] keep working and fighting and you know I
[71:57] don't what I don't want and I don't
[71:59] think many people thought this um just
[72:02] because uh how Bitcoiners are but like
[72:05] you know you got the executive order and
[72:07] you're like all set game set match. We
[72:09] did it, boys. And it doesn't work like
[72:12] that. Um, that's a very important step,
[72:16] but you have to keep going. You have to
[72:18] keep advocating. There's more work to
[72:20] do. And um, yeah, I I personally think
[72:24] the SPR is would be, you know, the
[72:28] buying program would be a phenomenal
[72:30] like uh, gigab brain move. It's like
[72:35] like we talked about with the internet,
[72:36] like we have this advantage
[72:39] We have 40% of the Bitcoin. We created
[72:43] the reserve. We're not going to sell our
[72:44] Bitcoin. It's like, dude, buy it, man.
[72:49] Like, get a bunch. Like, you're going,
[72:51] you know, whatever. Some people don't,
[72:53] you know, I get it. Some people are
[72:54] like, I don't want the United States to
[72:56] have all that Bitcoin. Just think like
[72:59] you're the United States, you know, like
[73:02] you're like, they really should do it.
[73:04] they would see, you know, secure this
[73:06] massive advantage uh for the foreseeable
[73:09] future. And I I do I I would love it. I
[73:12] think it would be awesome. And I think
[73:13] it would be good. I think it would be
[73:15] really good for um the Bitcoin network,
[73:18] the Bitcoin community. I think it'd be
[73:20] good for US citizens and I think it
[73:21] would be good for everyone
[73:23] internationally who uses Bitcoin. Um I
[73:25] think it's I think it's a I think it's a
[73:28] like a winwinwin.
[73:30] Um so that's why I'm like really
[73:32] passionate about. I think it's a
[73:33] fantastic idea. Well, I think it's also
[73:35] important for people to realize this
[73:37] goes back to something you said earlier,
[73:39] just that like uh if Bitcoin was uh
[73:44] going to become successful, of course,
[73:46] the government's going to pay attention
[73:48] to it. And I've I've said this a ton as
[73:50] well. It's like this is what winning
[73:52] looks like. If Bitcoin was a loser, if
[73:55] Bitcoin had failed, then we wouldn't be
[73:57] having this conversation because the US
[73:59] government wouldn't care. But if Bitcoin
[74:01] was going to, if you believe that hyper
[74:03] Bitcoinization is going to happen, if
[74:04] you believe that Bitcoin is going to
[74:06] become the dominant money, the dominant
[74:08] network in the world and suck in all of
[74:11] the value of the world, you must
[74:13] necessarily believe that every
[74:15] government, every business, and every
[74:17] individual is going to hold Bitcoin. And
[74:19] if you don't believe that, then you
[74:20] don't actually understand what's
[74:22] happening. A, and you probably don't
[74:24] have that much conviction in a
[74:25] hypercoitinized future, B. Which is
[74:27] fine. But if you do think those are
[74:30] going to happen, if you do have
[74:30] conviction in Bitcoin, if you do think
[74:32] Bitcoin is winning and will win, these
[74:35] are natural byproducts of that doesn't
[74:37] mean you have to like it. It just means
[74:39] that this was going to be inevitable in
[74:42] the case where Bitcoin is winning. And I
[74:44] think people miss that a lot. Like it's
[74:46] okay to not like it. Like I I have, you
[74:49] know, some qualms of my I own about it,
[74:51] but it's also it's going to happen
[74:53] either way. So it's like you you know
[74:56] and we've got to remember like the
[74:58] government isn't Trojan horsing us. We
[75:00] are Trojan horsing the government. We
[75:02] just have to we just as as American
[75:04] Huddle said, you know, we just
[75:05] Bitcoiners just need to know when to
[75:07] shut up when you're inside the horse.
[75:08] Like just be quiet, guys.
[75:12] They're letting us in, man. I know. Just
[75:14] you guys you guys shut up. Just stop
[75:16] talking. No more podcasts, right? Yeah.
[75:19] No more, please.
[75:21] I'm I'm shutting it down right now.
[75:23] pulling the plug. Yeah. All right. Yep.
[75:25] See you. Yeah. We We'll delete this.
[75:28] Yeah. No, man. Like, yeah. I mean,
[75:30] everybody's favorite band just went
[75:31] mainstream, you know? Like, it sucks. It
[75:34] sucks. But and like maybe feel like they
[75:37] sold out a little bit, but like you got
[75:38] the t-shirt. You were there for the I
[75:40] knew about them before they were cool
[75:42] though. Like I knew about I saw their
[75:43] first shows. That's great, man, because
[75:45] you can tell those old stories like
[75:47] about the, you know, I heard him in a
[75:49] bar and know who they were and I like,
[75:51] you know, smoke weed was the lead singer
[75:53] and they all that kind of stuff. That's
[75:54] great. Those are great stories to have.
[75:57] But yeah, it's just inevitable if
[75:59] they're as talented as you thought they
[76:00] were back then. It was just a matter of
[76:03] time before they get signed to a big
[76:04] label. And I know it's more than that,
[76:06] too. And I know there's real risk and
[76:08] and people are uh who know way more and
[76:10] are smarter than I am are like, "Yeah,
[76:12] man." But like come on like you're not
[76:15] at all concerned about XYZ of course. Um
[76:18] but it was just bound to happen. And so
[76:21] I think, you know, we're uh I was
[76:26] talking to somebody the other day. It
[76:27] was like we like BPI didn't like bring
[76:30] Bitcoin to Washington DC, you know, like
[76:32] it's not like we like carried it up like
[76:34] they're like what Bitcoin
[76:38] brought itself to Washington DC. We're
[76:41] just here to be like, you know, there's
[76:43] no uh there's no CEO, right? We say all
[76:47] the time like there's no CEO of Bitcoin.
[76:48] Well, there's no co of Bitcoin, which
[76:50] means there's no government affairs
[76:52] team, there's no marketing department,
[76:53] there's no public affairs team, there's
[76:55] no on down the list. There's no nothing.
[76:58] And so, we have to build all of these
[77:00] things. And so, we're like, hey, we'll
[77:02] uh, you know, there could be there's
[77:04] plenty of other people that can meet
[77:05] with elected officials and talk about
[77:07] Bitcoin. We're going to do that, too.
[77:09] And we're going to build an institute
[77:10] and research it, and we want to give
[77:11] them like we want to give like good
[77:13] clean signal about Bitcoin to elected
[77:15] officials. that's uh that's like
[77:18] appropriate uh that's timely to what
[77:21] they're talking about. We want to
[77:22] connect it not just like here's Bitcoin
[77:25] whenever you would like to read it. Here
[77:27] are the uh halls filled with novels
[77:30] about of white paper. We want to connect
[77:33] it to like what's happening right now in
[77:34] the real world and so why does it matter
[77:36] to me now? That's what elected officials
[77:38] want to know. Like how does this how
[77:41] does this dovetail into the other things
[77:43] that are important to my constituents
[77:45] who also don't know anything about
[77:47] Bitcoin, right? Like if you go be uh
[77:50] Senator Lumis about Bitcoin, hopefully
[77:53] you got a bunch of people back home that
[77:55] care about Bitcoin or they're going to
[77:56] be like, "She's up there talking about
[77:58] Bitcoin. We don't have any jobs." You
[77:59] know, they're going to vote you out. You
[78:01] know, like talking about this damn
[78:02] Bitcoin again, you know, uh we got a
[78:05] mosquito problem. And so, you know,
[78:07] whatever it is, uh, you gotta connect it
[78:10] to the other things that people care
[78:11] about, uh, just like normal people. So,
[78:14] that's the that's the other side of it.
[78:16] I I know I I I I totally agree. And I'm
[78:19] curious, too. Are there any, uh, like
[78:21] without revealing any uh, sensitive
[78:24] information about who you've had these
[78:26] conversations with? Were there any like
[78:27] really kind of standout conversations
[78:30] that you had either with elected
[78:32] officials or just you know staffers,
[78:34] spouses, whatever that really jumped out
[78:36] at you where it was like oh this was
[78:38] like I like it's amazing how this
[78:40] happened like where where it went better
[78:42] than you could have imagined maybe.
[78:45] Sure. Yeah. A few times. Um,
[78:49] one that has just stuck with me. I think
[78:52] it was because it was, you know, it was
[78:55] kind of early days and uh, I I got
[79:00] invited to this like fancy, you know,
[79:04] dinner thing and somebody's like a
[79:06] mansion, you know, in Tennessee or uh,
[79:09] Kentucky, actually. I can't remember. It
[79:11] was uh, try not to give too much away,
[79:13] man. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.
[79:16] doxing doxing my own story. Uh but yeah,
[79:19] somewhere in the country. No, I I I went
[79:21] to this uh event and there were a bunch
[79:24] of elected officials there and um I'm
[79:27] meeting with different people and you
[79:29] know, just kind of making the rounds and
[79:30] I don't really know a lot of people uh
[79:32] just cuz I'm kind of new to the industry
[79:34] and and so I'm I'm uh I'm sitting and
[79:37] I'm chatting with uh with a lady and uh
[79:41] we're having a conversation. somebody
[79:42] introduced me and I find out her husband
[79:45] is elected official and so we're having
[79:47] this great conversation and she's asking
[79:49] me what I do. You know, we're kind of in
[79:51] this little group and so her and I are
[79:53] kind of sidebaring. I'm like, I'm with
[79:54] Bitcoin policy institute. She's like,
[79:56] well, you got to tell me all about that
[79:57] because, you know, I've got my kids and
[79:59] their grandkids or whatever and they're
[80:01] all into, you know, buying the stuff in
[80:03] their phones and like I just don't, you
[80:04] know, whatever understand all. And so
[80:06] we're like just chatting like you know
[80:09] it was just so uh it was just cool and
[80:12] and she was trying to understand and she
[80:14] just wasn't clicking and I had just come
[80:17] back from an event where uh like Roya
[80:21] and uh and Anna and a bunch of the HRF
[80:24] crew were talking about you know some of
[80:27] their experiences and for whatever
[80:29] reason I was like um okay
[80:34] you are uh upper middle class woman like
[80:37] yourself in Afghanistan. Uh the US like
[80:41] it, love it, hate it, whatever, bails on
[80:44] the country after build, you know, kind
[80:46] of turning into a what civilized country
[80:49] for a decade. You just disappear and we
[80:52] let some like crazy group take
[80:54] overnight.
[80:55] So you are um you're uh you're you, but
[81:01] you're in Afghanistan. You're an Afghani
[81:02] woman and suddenly
[81:05] the banks are taking over, the
[81:07] currency's different, all hell's
[81:08] breaking loose and you're everything
[81:11] you've ever owned and built over the
[81:13] last 1015 years just evaporates
[81:15] overnight. She was like, "Yeah, I should
[81:17] start talking about Afghanistan." Like,
[81:18] "So anyways, uh, imagine that." Like
[81:22] that would suck really bad, you know?
[81:24] And I said, "You could try to leave the
[81:27] country. They're going to seize your
[81:29] currency. They're going to you could
[81:31] what are you going to carry gold in the
[81:32] bag? Like you're you're you're screwed.
[81:35] I said for the with Bitcoin for the
[81:37] first time in world history, ma'am, you
[81:39] can memorize 12 words. You get out of
[81:42] the country going over the world and you
[81:44] can take your life savings with you and
[81:45] start over. And that's the power it
[81:47] gives to women like you. That's the
[81:49] power it gives to people like you. They
[81:50] can you can make decisions. And nobody
[81:52] can take that from you. And this is the
[81:54] first time you can do it. This is the
[81:56] first time you can walk through freaking
[81:58] airport security and no one knows that
[82:01] you're taking your freedom with you.
[82:02] You're taking your you're taking
[82:04] everything that is yours. And uh it's
[82:07] it's liberty for people who um
[82:10] everything around them is designed to
[82:13] deny them liberty.
[82:16] And you know, she acted like she was
[82:18] like blown away at least. And I was
[82:20] like, "Okay, who knows?" And later that
[82:22] night, I um I ran into some staff for
[82:25] this elected official and I sat with
[82:28] them. They're like, "What did you say to
[82:30] his wife?" And I was like, "I don't what
[82:33] do you mean like that piss somebody
[82:35] off?" You know, I was kind of like
[82:36] they're like, "She made sort of like six
[82:38] books on Bitcoin and all this random
[82:40] stuff." And like I guess we got to read
[82:42] all these books now. And uh it made a
[82:45] huge impression. And so that was like
[82:47] I'm taking other people's stories and
[82:50] then I'm, you know, with it wasn't even
[82:52] with the elected official. I'm with his
[82:54] spouse. Uh which honestly I think is
[82:57] sometimes more powerful. Um and it's
[83:00] like okay I'm we're you know getting all
[83:03] involved in it now. And now the staff's
[83:06] like what are we talking about? Look why
[83:07] are we reading these books? I have to
[83:08] explain it to them. And so that's the
[83:11] work. That's what we do at a like you
[83:14] boil it all down. We take stories that
[83:16] aren't ours. We take research that we,
[83:19] you know, we have these fellows that
[83:21] build. We take all these resources and
[83:24] we try to just put them in a way, you
[83:27] know, at the right time to the right
[83:28] people to help get their attention and
[83:31] be like, you know what? Okay, this
[83:33] actually this Bitcoin thing actually is
[83:35] something. This is really important,
[83:37] isn't it? H oh, somebody's, you know,
[83:41] screwing with it. Somebody's trying to
[83:42] cut you guys legs out. That's not We're
[83:44] not letting that happen. And that's it.
[83:46] That's the gig. And uh right now, I
[83:49] mean, no, we've been pretty effective at
[83:51] it. I mean, we have a lot of things that
[83:52] have gone in our favor. Political winds.
[83:55] Uh Bitcoin's in a national conversation
[83:57] like, you know, he's just like, "Nope,
[83:59] we're we can't nobody will nobody will
[84:01] listen to us." You know, shouting into
[84:03] the void. And then boom, everybody's
[84:06] talking about Bitcoin. Presidents,
[84:07] presidential candidates are talking
[84:09] about Bitcoin. And so we saw this
[84:10] enormous enormous appetite for our work
[84:14] because everybody's like caught with
[84:16] their pants down like I don't know [ __ ]
[84:17] about Bitcoin. Like what? The
[84:19] president's talking about it. We don't
[84:20] know anything about it. Who who do we
[84:22] talk to? And that's what we built BPI
[84:24] for was that exact moment in time. Like
[84:27] we need to know about this last week. We
[84:29] need to know about this yesterday. We
[84:31] we're way off sides on this issue. We
[84:33] have no idea what we're doing. Who do we
[84:34] talk to? And how do we figure this out?
[84:37] And we're hoping when that happens that
[84:39] people have BPI and speed dial and
[84:41] that's what's happened. And so I'm
[84:42] really proud of that. Like we prepared
[84:44] for this moment. We didn't think it was
[84:45] going to happen like now, you know, like
[84:47] maybe years and years from now. So we're
[84:50] like, oh, it's happening, you know? Uh
[84:52] and so we're just really fortunate like,
[84:54] you know, had the resources, the time at
[84:58] the right place. Uh it was kind of like,
[85:00] you know, luck. Uh and and and but like
[85:03] prepare for the moment and then it
[85:05] happens and you're there. It's cool.
[85:07] Luck luck is what happens when
[85:09] preparation meets opportunity, right? I
[85:11] mean, I guess that's what I'm trying to
[85:12] say with like 40 words. Well, no, but
[85:15] like the the suddenly part came at you
[85:17] guys kind of suddenly, I guess. I mean,
[85:20] cuz it really did it wild. Yeah. No, it
[85:24] it is wild. I'm curious, too. Do you
[85:26] guys I know obviously uh you know you're
[85:28] working with uh you know uh
[85:30] congressional people, Senate people uh
[85:32] folks in the White House like a lot with
[85:35] you know stuff in DC but do you guys do
[85:36] work or provide this kind of guidance at
[85:39] the state level as well? Is that any of
[85:41] your focus or is your focus more on uh
[85:44] DC specifically like more on the federal
[85:46] level case by case? Uh we we we will
[85:50] when we can. Uh it's really been more of
[85:52] a bandwidth issue and
[85:55] States are like, you know, states are
[85:58] all like their own countries, you know,
[86:00] like they're all different. The
[86:02] political landscapes. That's where I
[86:04] focused mainly uh when we were talking
[86:06] about my career earlier. They're I think
[86:08] it's really cool. Like they're like
[86:10] micro countries. They all have their own
[86:12] like fancy, you know, state capital
[86:14] building. All the rules are different.
[86:17] There's similarities, you know, but like
[86:19] um you they're all it's all a different
[86:22] game, you know, and you gotta you got to
[86:24] know you can't just show up in some
[86:26] state and be like, I'm here to be the
[86:28] whatever and they're going to be like
[86:30] you're going to get cooked, dude. Like
[86:31] you're just going to get like char
[86:33] broiled. Uh they're going to take your
[86:35] money, man. They're going to, you know,
[86:37] it's like it's it's so funny. Um, and so
[86:41] to commit to doing state level work,
[86:43] it's a it's you don't do that lightly
[86:45] and uh you don't you don't it's a it's
[86:49] almost like a completely different
[86:50] animal. Now that in we have um done a
[86:54] few things. We have and we're going to
[86:57] be continuing to work on uh like model
[87:00] state legislation. I don't know if
[87:01] you're familiar with that term, but can
[87:04] you can you explain that? Yeah. So, um,
[87:07] there's organizations like ALEC and and
[87:10] things like this. I think I'll tell you
[87:11] about ALEC. Um, it's just a a prime
[87:16] example of this. The American
[87:17] Legislative Exchange Council. And so, I
[87:20] told you about all the different states
[87:22] or all like their own little land like
[87:24] different different countries is a way
[87:26] of thinking about it. elected officials,
[87:29] Alex on the Republican side, they get
[87:31] all the different states together, all
[87:34] the elected officials, and they all go
[87:36] to this big conference,
[87:38] and they all figure out like, you know,
[87:41] um like I told you earlier, like we're
[87:43] not experts on all this stuff. Like,
[87:45] okay. But then they all get together and
[87:47] they meet and they're like, "All right,
[87:48] we all want to like, you know, whatever
[87:52] uh be a right to work state or whatever,
[87:55] right? or we all want to cut taxes. And
[87:58] they're like, "Okay, our powers
[88:00] combined. We can come up with like the
[88:02] perfect way to do this and like the
[88:05] language and all this sort of thing. Um,
[88:08] and here's our strategy for it as like a
[88:10] group of states." And so you kind of get
[88:12] together and plan um as allies. And it
[88:15] works because you're you're getting way
[88:18] more uh expertise like legal guidance
[88:21] like you versus like if you and I were
[88:24] the you know Iowa representative me
[88:28] we're sitting around drinking bourbon
[88:29] like what do you think Walker? Let's cut
[88:31] taxes. My buddy's an attorney. Let's
[88:32] have him draw up the language. You know
[88:34] like it might pass but like sounds like
[88:37] a good time though. I'm just saying
[88:39] cutting taxes and drinking bourbon. That
[88:41] is my kind of planning session. That
[88:43] sounds like a country song. Uh, so yeah,
[88:46] man. I'm going to have AI write one
[88:48] right after this about cutting taxes and
[88:50] drinking bourbon. Sorry. Continue. We'll
[88:52] perform it on the next uh rip. Uh, so
[88:55] yeah, man. I uh we we're like we're
[88:58] looking at all the SB bills and some of
[89:01] the ones that are uh that are uh aren't
[89:04] out yet and some of the states that
[89:05] don't have it yet. And so we we're
[89:08] working on model straight state
[89:09] legislation for some of those issues.
[89:10] though like, hey, all states who want to
[89:13] do a strategic Bitcoin reserve, here's
[89:14] the way the Bitcoin Policy Institute
[89:16] thinks you should do it. Uh, and you
[89:19] don't have to do it exactly this way,
[89:20] but like we, you know, we've tried to
[89:23] think through this soup to nuts and and
[89:25] make sure that like this doesn't
[89:27] accidentally get interpreted this way or
[89:29] that two years from now this doesn't
[89:30] happen and uh what about this legal, you
[89:33] know, backdoor thing. And so we try to
[89:35] help put together a a bomb-proof version
[89:38] of it. Um, not that some of the other
[89:40] ones out there aren't. There's just a
[89:42] lot of states that haven't done this yet
[89:44] and there's a lot of different opinions
[89:45] about how it should be done. And so
[89:48] we're throwing our hat in the ring on
[89:50] some of those issues and saying like,
[89:51] hey, here's what we kind of think. Um,
[89:53] it'll probably be similar to some of the
[89:54] things you've seen before. It may be
[89:55] different to some of them. Uh, a lot
[89:57] different than some of them. And so, uh,
[89:59] so yeah, that's it. That's the state
[90:01] side. Um we do have a if you want to go
[90:04] to people want to go to our website like
[90:05] there is a cool thing we put out that is
[90:08] um it's our uh uh policy framework. So
[90:13] basically here's a comprehensive policy
[90:15] framework for US leadership on Bitcoin.
[90:18] And we haven't done anything quite like
[90:19] this. Zack Shapiro, who is just one an
[90:23] awesome guy, a great person, and also
[90:26] like unbelievably talented and gifted
[90:29] individual, put this together. Um, and
[90:33] he's the executive director of
[90:34] peer-to-peer rights fund, which is uh
[90:37] which is a BPI project as well. That's
[90:39] one of our big ones, man. Like
[90:40] peer-to-peer rights is is uh heart and
[90:44] soul of of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network,
[90:47] and Bitcoiners. And so that's always
[90:48] going to be a priority for us is like
[90:50] like we got to we got to keep our eye on
[90:52] that. We got to fix some things. We got
[90:54] some people that don't probably uh pro
[90:56] in prison probably ought not to be man
[90:57] and uh need to get out of there. And so
[91:00] we got a lot of work there to do and uh
[91:03] but you know the the the Bitcoiners have
[91:06] been massively supportive of that. So
[91:09] anyway um this policy manifesto is on
[91:12] our is on our homepage. It's like I
[91:15] don't know it's like 30 pages and we go
[91:17] through like what's Bitcoin, why is it
[91:19] important, here's our mission, here's a
[91:20] holistic view of uh of our three policy
[91:24] domains. So like economics and and
[91:27] geopolitics, technology and innovation,
[91:29] mining and energy and like what we're
[91:31] thinking and why it's important to US
[91:33] policy and dollar dominance. We go
[91:35] through the entire uh kitten koodle in
[91:38] there. So, if you want to really roll up
[91:40] your sleeves and learn, like go to that,
[91:43] go to our website, btcpolicy.org,
[91:46] and it's like one of the first links is
[91:48] the Bitcoin Policy Institute
[91:49] Comprehensive Policy Framework. I'll uh
[91:52] I'll I'll link this uh I'll link this in
[91:54] the show notes, too. Okay. Yeah. And if
[91:57] you go down, scroll if I don't if you
[91:58] can scroll down just a hair, it says
[92:00] view PDF on the left side, and that's
[92:02] where you get the whole doc. Boom. I
[92:05] love that cover page, too. Yeah. That's
[92:07] nice. That's nice. I I have not I have
[92:10] not actually read this. I'm have to I'm
[92:11] gonna have to dig through this. Well, it
[92:13] just came out like during or like right
[92:15] before Vegas, so Okay. People have been
[92:18] a little busy. I don't Most people still
[92:19] haven't like recovered enough to be able
[92:22] to read a white paper yet. So, I Yeah,
[92:24] my Yeah, my brain cell count is still uh
[92:26] still a bit down, I think. Right. Yeah,
[92:29] unfortunately. Worth it, though. Worth
[92:31] it. Was worth it. It was a great week.
[92:35] Yeah. What about you, man? like uh what?
[92:37] Anything else? Any other questions?
[92:38] Anything we need to talk about? How much
[92:40] time do we have? I have no idea. We are
[92:42] actually I mean honestly this was we're
[92:44] pretty perfectly on time. We're we're
[92:46] coming right up on 90 minutes. Um so we
[92:48] we time time was flying here. Well, I'll
[92:51] ask I mean so I want to want to
[92:53] encourage people again if you want to uh
[92:55] come to DC, you can sign up for the
[92:58] Bitcoin Policy Summit. Again, uh if you
[93:01] go to btcpolicy.org
[93:04] org. Uh you can click the links through
[93:06] or go to bdc policysummit.org.
[93:08] You can use the promo code walker for

[93:19] want to hang out there, orange pill the
[93:21] swamp, we will be there. Should be a lot
[93:23] of fun. I I don't know. Was there
[93:25] anything we didn't cover? We covered a
[93:26] lot today. We we got a lot in. We didn't
[93:30] get a chance to talk about home mining
[93:31] and gardening. So, I think we're going
[93:32] to we're going to maybe have to do a
[93:34] whole separate a whole separate rip on
[93:36] that. Yeah, man. I I I just like write I
[93:39] don't know about you, I just like write
[93:40] random thoughts down in my notes on my
[93:42] phone. And so, you were like, "Hey, like
[93:44] what's top of mind?" And I was like,
[93:46] home mining and gardening is something I
[93:48] thought about the other, you know, I was
[93:49] actually just thinking I was thinking
[93:51] about this the literally like maybe last
[93:53] week cuz I was like, I want to build out
[93:55] a greenhouse that I can still operate in
[93:57] the winter, you know, as a standalone
[93:59] building, but like I want to heat it
[94:01] with with Bitcoin miners like because
[94:03] then, you know, like that that I'm not
[94:05] wasting, you know, if you're not mining
[94:06] Bitcoin, you're wasting energy. So, I
[94:08] don't want to be an energy waster. uh I
[94:10] you know like the like the United
[94:12] Kingdom or any of those other countries
[94:13] that aren't uh aren't using their excess
[94:15] power to mine uh mine Bitcoin. But yeah,
[94:18] so I I was thinking about this as well.
[94:19] I'm going to I'm going to have to play
[94:20] around with some stuff. I've got an old
[94:22] S9 sitting in my garage uh that uh we
[94:25] used for a skit once, uh Carl and I, but
[94:28] I didn't actually mine with it. Uh but I
[94:30] do have my Bitax that I just got in the
[94:32] mail, so I'm excited about that. Yeah,
[94:35] that's cool, man. I I've been eyeing the
[94:37] Bit Axe. the bit axes the bed axis
[94:42] which uh and yeah the the bit about the
[94:45] gardening is like you know if you've
[94:48] done a garden which I I'm sure you have
[94:50] you know the ROI is not like if you want
[94:54] tomatoes there are cheaper ways of
[94:57] getting tomatoes but like the experience
[95:00] the learning and the freedom element of
[95:04] gardening like I grew my own damn food
[95:07] and I can do that and I know how to do
[95:09] that and I'm demonstrating to my
[95:10] children that that is a possibility. Not
[95:13] only a possibility but a preferred way
[95:15] of doing it and this is where your food
[95:18] comes from. It takes a lot of work.
[95:20] Somebody had to grow a seed and somebody
[95:22] had to make the seed go and then you
[95:24] know and you see a little seed come this
[95:26] I think it's similar uh this is just the
[95:28] quick you know answer. Yeah. Yeah. It's
[95:31] similar to home mining like people like
[95:32] why would you home mine? Like it's so
[95:35] you're paying more for the Bitcoin, you
[95:37] know? It's like, well, yeah, I'm paying
[95:38] more for the tomatoes, too, but that's
[95:39] not the damn point, man. Like, it's
[95:40] about freedom and about like exercising
[95:43] my liberty and my autonomy as a human.
[95:46] And I don't know why, but those two the
[95:48] rationale and the challenges and people
[95:51] are like, sure are spend a lot of time
[95:53] on that stupid garden when you could go
[95:55] to the grocery store. It's like, dude,
[95:57] you just don't get it. It's the same
[95:58] thing with home mining. And so, uh, it
[96:01] was a whole, uh, a whole bit I was
[96:02] working on, but I love that. No, I I
[96:05] love that. And now we we are going to
[96:06] have to do another rip and and get into
[96:07] that cuz I think there's, uh, that
[96:10] dovetales well with like planting fruit
[96:12] trees like I always like I I love fruit
[96:14] trees. I've always loved apple trees,
[96:17] uh, especially cuz I love me some
[96:18] apples. And like it's one of those
[96:20] things where an apple tree typically
[96:22] takes about four years to bear fruit.
[96:24] Like it takes an epoch basically, you
[96:26] know, it takes a Bitcoin cycle to bear
[96:28] fruit. And so it's just a it's a it's a
[96:31] great lesson in low time preference
[96:34] behavior. It's like you're not going to
[96:36] see the benefits right away. You're not
[96:37] going to see the benefits in the next
[96:38] year or two years. You're it's going to
[96:40] take you multiple years, four years to
[96:43] start to see the benefits. And like
[96:45] that's the same with holding Bitcoin.
[96:46] It's like you're not Yeah, you may see
[96:48] it may go up, may go down in the near
[96:50] term, but like you need to wait about a
[96:52] cycle to really start saying, "Oh, wow.
[96:55] Okay, now I see why I did this because I
[96:57] have there's a lot of fruit on my tree.
[97:00] A lot of bitcorns that have been uh been
[97:02] growing. Yeah, the apple tree won't give
[97:04] you nearly as much anxiety though as as
[97:07] buying Bitcoin and holding for four
[97:10] years. Unless you got a lot of deer,
[97:12] Unless you got a lot of deer on your
[97:14] property, cuz they love nipping those
[97:15] little apple trees. They really do.
[97:18] Yeah. Maybe maybe maybe the apple tree
[97:20] is is uh is causes more anxiety than
[97:24] Yeah.
[97:25] I also give it to Bitcoin's volatile.
[97:27] Just plant a few apple trees. Yes. See
[97:30] what happens there. Good luck dealing
[97:31] with the deer. You know, man, this was
[97:34] uh this was a great rip. I'll link uh
[97:36] I'll link you uh your your socials in
[97:39] the show notes. bdcpolicy.org
[97:41] bdcpolicsummit.org for folks that want
[97:43] to check that out. Anywhere else you
[97:45] want to send people? Uh I'll link that
[97:46] report as well. But anything else that
[97:48] you want me to drop in the show notes or
[97:50] send people to? No, that's it. Um that's
[97:53] it. If anybody has questions, I'm on the
[97:55] website and uh happy to, you know, chat
[97:58] with anybody at any time about our work
[98:00] and and uh you know, I know there's
[98:02] especially in Austria, there's a lot of
[98:03] people that that want to know more and
[98:06] and engage with our ideas or come to our
[98:08] event or whatever. So, uh we are uh you
[98:12] know, we're ready and and willing to
[98:13] chat. Uh appreciate you having me on,
[98:15] man. This was this was fun. uh good way

[98:23] Thanks for coming out to DC. I'm excited
[98:25] for you to be a part of it. Yeah, I'm
[98:27] excited, too. And you know, maybe we uh
[98:28] we get a little bit of bourbon, draft up
[98:30] some uh some tax cuts or something while
[98:32] we're there. I don't know. We'll just
[98:34] we'll see what happens. Could get crazy.
[98:35] Taxes on Bitcoin. Uh they're like, "Oh
[98:38] yeah, that's what we'll do. We'll uh
[98:40] we'll cut all taxes on Bitcoin." How's
[98:42] that?
[98:43] that that's my that's my number one
[98:44] policy priority is uh no no cap gains
[98:47] tax on Bitcoin
[98:51] that' be a banger we'll work on it man
[98:54] the more bourbon the higher the tax got
[98:57] I know you guys will thanks man it was
[98:59] it was great chatting yeah likewise
