[00:00] Seems like every time missiles start
[00:01] flying, people go, "Is this World War
[00:02] II?" My read situation is we've kind of
[00:05] been in World War II since you could say
[00:09] co, you know, if you're being a bit more
[00:10] conspiratorial or at least since the
[00:12] Russia Ukraine war popped off.
[00:20] We just the way great power conflict and
[00:23] um regional conflicts unfold. Now when
[00:25] you have nuclear powers and a tightly
[00:28] integrated global system that's
[00:30] dominated by elite political factions
[00:31] that function almost as competing
[00:32] mafias, they don't really want to fight
[00:35] head-to-head, right? They don't really
[00:37] want to have to fight, you know, true
[00:39] large-scale kinetic wars with other
[00:41] great powers because those could destroy
[00:43] the whole planet and could certainly
[00:44] lead to massive loss of like wealth for
[00:47] the elites in those political systems.
[00:48] So what we've seen is essentially kind
[00:50] of proxy wars, you know, wars in space,
[00:53] assassinations, sabotage campaigns,
[00:56] cyber attacks, and kind of this um arc
[00:58] of instability across the Eurasian
[01:00] periphery, which sort of structures this
[01:01] this global conflict that's playing out
[01:04] between, you could say the Eurasian sort
[01:06] of autocratic powers, you know, Russia,
[01:08] China, uh Iran, North Korea, and then
[01:11] kind of the legacy sort of western
[01:13] international sort of security regime
[01:16] underpinned by the US as the global
[01:17] hegeon. on but kind of the great ocean
[01:20] right kind of you mostly like ocean
[01:23] mostly sort of maritime commercial sort
[01:25] of um capitalist countries US Japan
[01:28] South Korea Australia the UK uh and
[01:31] Israel and so you have kind of this this
[01:33] these like this this sort of meta
[01:35] narrative which is kind of this this
[01:37] competition between uh global orders and
[01:40] kind of um uh insurgent uh powers kind
[01:44] of rising powers want to challenge the
[01:45] legacy system and then finding friends,
[01:48] right, to kind of do, you know,
[01:50] variations of alignment with. And that's
[01:52] kind of maybe what you have with kind of
[01:53] Russia, China, Iran, North Korea. And so
[01:56] you have kind of these local versions of
[01:57] this conflict, Russia, Ukraine. You have
[01:59] other Russian and Western conflicts that
[02:01] are much more subrosa in the North Sea
[02:03] in the Arctic and space and other, you
[02:05] know, more deniable things. And then you
[02:07] have, you know, the Iran Israel kind of
[02:09] flash point that has had lots of other
[02:11] sort of regional manifestations. You
[02:13] have Iran Pak, sorry, you have India
[02:14] Pakistan. you have kind of latent
[02:16] conflict the subject of a lot of
[02:18] speculation when when or if right
[02:19] between China and Taiwan then you have
[02:21] North Korea uh you know always a bit bit
[02:23] of a wild card there so you've got kind
[02:25] of this this arc of instability here and
[02:27] you could call that World War II in the
[02:29] sense that it is um it is a they're
[02:32] regional conflicts that have their own
[02:34] sort of local character and their own
[02:35] sort of you know sort of history to that
[02:37] to those to those you know sort of
[02:39] adversarial relationships but but now
[02:42] they're linked into this global um this
[02:44] global this global frame, right? Uh and
[02:46] that every conflict is bringing in other
[02:49] regional and global powers, right? It's
[02:50] the reason why Russia Ukraine isn't just
[02:52] the Russia Ukraine thing, right? It's
[02:54] essentially whole western security
[02:55] apparatus and then Russia getting
[02:57] support from both Iran, uh North Korea
[03:00] and China, right? This is kind of the
[03:02] globalization of these local conflicts.
[03:04] And so when you say World War II, it's
[03:05] sort of the implication is going back to
[03:06] like other world wars that started
[03:08] local, you know, like AustriaHungary,
[03:10] right? Serbian, you know, assassinations
[03:12] that pulled in more and more
[03:13] belligerance until you had basically the
[03:15] entire world, you know, thrown down.
[03:17] And, you know, I think what we've seen
[03:19] thus far is we don't have the same sort
[03:21] of balance of power dynamic where you
[03:22] have all these sort of chains of of
[03:24] alliance and mutual defense treaties,
[03:26] right? Where it's like all of a sudden
[03:27] one thing pops off and then everyone is
[03:28] going to war. We have article 5 of NATO.
[03:30] That's obviously what Ukraine isn't
[03:32] party to. So, that's kind of kept it
[03:34] mitigated. Israel, we have a sort of
[03:37] mutual defense, but uh you know, it's
[03:39] mostly arms supplies like and then
[03:41] depending on how things go, like we
[03:42] could get involved. So, I see this
[03:44] Israel Iran conflict, it's been playing
[03:46] out for a long time, and clearly this
[03:48] was a flash point that the political
[03:51] leadership decided to take in the
[03:53] context of Trump now coming into office.
[03:56] I think the most recent indications are
[03:58] one, it was immensely successful, maybe
[04:00] more successful than than is than Israel
[04:02] even anticipated. They wiped out like
[04:04] large swaths of the military uh and
[04:06] scientific establishment. They
[04:08] apparently had significant strikes on
[04:10] some of the nuclear enrichment
[04:11] facilities, Natans and Fordau, although
[04:13] Ford, we'll see if those are deeply
[04:15] buried uh and really kind of embarrassed
[04:17] the Iranians. basically took down most
[04:19] of the air defense systems and pretty
[04:21] much have been operating unopposed uh in
[04:23] in Iranian skies it seems which is a
[04:25] demonstration of just technical prowess
[04:27] right strategic surprise and builds on
[04:30] sort of you know previous sort of
[04:31] Israeli operations of similar sort of
[04:34] you know um strategic stealth going
[04:36] after the Hezbollah leadership the Pedro
[04:38] attack there's various assassinations
[04:39] that they've conducted have been very
[04:41] much sort of precision pinpoint strikes
[04:42] inside Iran and so I think Trump uh his
[04:46] most recent statements today essentially
[04:47] indicated like, "Hey, Iran, I gave you
[04:49] 60 days. I wanted you to come to the
[04:51] table to negotiate a, you know, grand
[04:53] bargain." I think the contours of that
[04:55] grand bargain were you give up your
[04:56] ambitions to to a nuclear weapon and
[04:59] we'll help basically facilitate the
[05:01] development of a civilian and highly
[05:03] sort of sort of regulated nuclear
[05:05] industry, we'll unlock a bunch of, you
[05:07] know, frozen funds, remove some
[05:09] sanctions, allow you to kind of
[05:10] economically develop and get rich. And
[05:12] um, you know, that was like 61 days ago.
[05:15] And so he said 61 days are up. And now
[05:17] he gives the green light for BB to go
[05:19] and start murking some guys, including
[05:21] some of the guys that he said, you know,
[05:22] were on the other end of this
[05:24] negotiating table. And he's like, well,
[05:25] they're dead now, right? And so there's
[05:27] like a kind of a it's it was almost kind
[05:29] of dark darkly comical in the sense that
[05:31] like Trump was like, you know, almost
[05:33] bragging about the guys that were like
[05:35] being hard asses on the other side of of
[05:37] the negotiating table. They're dead now.
[05:39] So if you want to replace those people,
[05:41] Iran, maybe you should come up maybe you
[05:42] should send people that are are going to
[05:44] be a bit more cooperative. It was it was
[05:46] pretty pretty blatant uh with that. I'm
[05:48] I'm skeptical this will like lead to
[05:50] like a total conflration in the region.
[05:52] I think we've had lots of occasions of
[05:54] missiles flying back and forth and I
[05:56] think the biggest reason why is that
[05:57] Iran is actually now looks not very
[05:59] strong at all. Right? I didn't see a
[06:01] single, you know, Russian fighter trying
[06:04] to intercept uh, you know, an Israeli
[06:05] fighter. And the fact that MSAD was able
[06:07] to operate with a large footprint in
[06:09] country means it had a massive network
[06:10] of incountry facilitators. And the fact
[06:12] that they were able to target so many of
[06:14] these senior military and, you know,
[06:16] important people at the same time means
[06:18] that they, you know, like they can track
[06:20] these people pretty pretty well from the
[06:21] outside, but like to get like where they
[06:23] sleep in their bedrooms, right? like
[06:25] across across like all these different
[06:28] cities and hit them all in real time
[06:30] means that they had extremely strong
[06:31] incountry intelligence. In fact, I sort
[06:33] of I somewhat suspect, although it's
[06:35] definitely a little bit more of a
[06:36] speculation that they probably have more
[06:38] than just an intelligence network inside
[06:39] the country, but probably have a set of
[06:41] individuals in the political apparatus
[06:43] that are very much opposed to kind of
[06:45] these hardline Islamist faction that
[06:47] wants to take the country to war. And
[06:49] you know, if Israel is there to kind of
[06:51] wipe out your political opponents for
[06:53] you, you know, all you have to do is
[06:54] like help them out with where they sleep
[06:56] and boom, like most of your opposition
[06:59] is dead inside the country. It's kind of
[07:01] a win-win for you. So, we'll see. I'm
[07:03] think general like I try to fade
[07:05] geopolitical risk, right? It's always a
[07:06] sell the news or buy the news, right? Uh
[07:09] event. Um there's obviously failure
[07:11] modes here where very bad very bad
[07:13] things could happen. I think the worst
[07:14] case scenario would be like a an attempt
[07:16] by Iran to try to close the street of
[07:18] Hamuz or to conduct uh you know
[07:22] largecale terrorist attacks in the west
[07:24] because if it looks like they can't
[07:25] actually respond kinetically which it
[07:27] looks like they really can't they tried
[07:28] launching some drones almost all of them
[07:30] got intercepted their command and
[07:31] control apparatus is basically in
[07:33] tatters they could reconstitute it but
[07:34] we'll see and meanwhile Israel was able
[07:36] to strike most of their or a lot of
[07:38] their ballistic missiles and just kind
[07:39] of defang them it looks like and we'll
[07:41] see right it's been only a day or so so
[07:44] be too too uh too premature in judging
[07:47] it. But if they can't, you know,
[07:48] credibly respond in a way that, you
[07:50] know, allows them to maintain a bit of
[07:52] dignity, then they'll then they'll turn
[07:54] to their asymmetric options, which are,
[07:56] you know, essentially their terror cells
[07:58] that they've established overseas, a lot
[08:00] in South America, a lot even in North
[08:02] America and Western Europe to to attack,
[08:04] you know, sort of softer targets and to
[08:06] try to, you know, impose uh pain um in
[08:09] retaliation. And what that then triggers
[08:11] as a western counter response, you know,
[08:13] depending on how deadly they are, could
[08:15] be the thing that tips over Western
[08:16] public opinion, right, to engage much
[08:18] more militarily in like a regime change
[08:20] operation, which I think is the main
[08:22] thing that is like dividing the kind of
[08:24] MAGA movement or the national security
[08:26] apparatus inside the Trump
[08:27] administration, which is, you know, I
[08:28] think divided between like Iran hawks,
[08:31] the kind of, you know, the Lindsey
[08:32] Grahams of the world that are just like
[08:34] out for out for blood and the folks that
[08:36] even include, you know, Vice President
[08:38] Vance, which is, you know he was a
[08:40] Marine and his whole um line has been no
[08:44] more, you know, no more foreign wars in
[08:46] the Middle East, right? No more uh you
[08:48] know, getting getting dragged down into
[08:50] these internal conflicts where it's
[08:52] often the poor that that uh that bleed
[08:55] out uh in the desert um to fight fight
[08:58] for the elites. I think there's a strong
[09:01] opposition to US engagement uh with
[09:04] boots on the ground or with anything
[09:06] that could trigger a larger conflict.
[09:08] Israel certainly wants to try to bring
[09:09] us in because if they really want to
[09:10] take out the nuclear program for good
[09:12] and not just set it back a few months,
[09:14] they would need US strike support. And
[09:16] so I think that's what they're trying to
[09:17] angle for. If I and this has been a bit
[09:19] of a rambling assessment, the last point
[09:20] I would make is I think the the most
[09:22] important thing that Israel is trying to
[09:23] get out of the next few days and weeks
[09:25] as they're going to continue these sort
[09:26] of rolling targeted strikes. One, their
[09:28] their manosaurities they can feel is
[09:29] limited. Even if they've, you know,
[09:31] established air supremacy, they just
[09:32] don't have it's a long way for those
[09:34] fighters to to to fly. You eventually
[09:36] hitting these deeply buried targets
[09:38] requires munitions that the um Israeli
[09:40] military may not actually have or or
[09:41] have in sufficient quantities to have a
[09:43] strategic effect. So they would might
[09:44] need US munitions or strike support with
[09:47] these um uh with targeting these these
[09:50] deeply buried facilities like at Fordo
[09:52] um which is like 200 feet in the rock
[09:54] with the centrifuges. So, I think BB's
[09:57] line here is to Trump now, hey, look,
[10:00] like we we got their pants down. Like,
[10:02] they're vulnerable. Like, if you just
[10:04] Annie up just a bit, you know, send a
[10:06] few more strikes in to help take out
[10:08] these facilities. Like, we can we can
[10:09] turn this from a monthslong set back to
[10:12] a yearslong setback and dramatically
[10:14] improve your negotiating position. And I
[10:17] think for Trump, who is very much always
[10:19] like a, you know, go by his, you know,
[10:22] vibe in the moment kind of decision
[10:24] maker, I could see him getting convinced
[10:27] to support some targeted strikes on some
[10:30] of these uh critical facilities where
[10:32] it's like once you've once you've popped
[10:33] the seal of hitting hitting Iran and if
[10:36] you're expecting Iran to retaliate kind
[10:38] of regardless, well, you might as well
[10:39] just go all the way, right? Then you
[10:41] then the question is if you knock out
[10:42] their their nuclear program not for good
[10:44] but like very much substantially then
[10:46] you get to this next point which is then
[10:48] the Israelis go well look we basically
[10:50] pants them we've knocked out their air
[10:52] supremacy knocked out the nuclear
[10:54] program we've killed most of their
[10:55] senior generals in both the goods force
[10:57] and and the military chief of staff a
[10:59] lot of the intelligence systems let's
[11:00] just go for kamani let's just take them
[11:03] out right like fullon you know like
[11:06] regime change you know that term regime
[11:08] change right has very much like gets
[11:11] people start to scratch, right? But and
[11:13] that would be like an that would be very
[11:15] much a radical proposition a few weeks
[11:17] ago. But if you get to this point where
[11:18] each incremental strike looks like it's
[11:21] easier than you thought, well then
[11:22] actually changing the political
[11:24] environment inside Iran becomes less of
[11:26] a impossible proposition and there's a
[11:28] lot of people inside the national
[11:29] security apparatus that would like that
[11:31] are going to constantly be tirpin in
[11:33] that direction. So that's that's the
[11:35] thing to watch. not World War II, but
[11:37] just does the ratchet of successful
[11:39] strikes increase the chance of US
[11:41] engagement because Trump wants to
[11:43] basically get the most leverage he can.
[11:45] And the last point, sorry, would be
[11:46] think about Iran in the context of of
[11:48] the China trade war and and negotiations
[11:50] there. There was like that's the main
[11:52] dynamic that Trump is kind of concerned
[11:53] by in the sense that China has a lot of
[11:55] leverage over us. We have a lot of a lot
[11:56] of leverage over China. were somewhat
[11:58] equally matched like we basically came
[12:00] came to blows liberation day massive
[12:02] tariffs almost a mutual embargo that
[12:04] started creating almost economic
[12:06] catastrophe inside China because you
[12:07] have entire cities that are just like
[12:09] you know now don't have an economic
[12:11] purpose if they can't export and so
[12:12] there's a lot of in potential internal
[12:14] you know instability being triggered as
[12:16] well as financial instability in the
[12:17] west right if you have inflation you
[12:19] have bond market instability you have 5%
[12:21] plus you know 30-year that you know best
[12:23] started getting you know worried about
[12:24] high high move index sort of mutually
[12:26] assured econom omic destruction. And so
[12:28] we kind of came to the table in Geneva
[12:30] and then just had the most recent, you
[12:31] know, meetings and phone calls to try
[12:33] to, you know, reccalibrate, come to a
[12:35] quote deal. And a lot of it was like the
[12:36] rare earth stuff, the Chinese students
[12:38] stuff. But I think Trump Trump wasn't
[12:41] like a master planner looking at all
[12:43] the, you know, advantages and
[12:44] disadvantages. He just was like, "Let's
[12:45] go for it. Let's figure it out." And now
[12:47] he's I think he's now discovered kind of
[12:49] just how much leverage China has over us
[12:51] and also how much leverage maybe we have
[12:53] over them. But like where where the
[12:54] actual points of leverage and and pain
[12:56] are. And I think he's looking at Iran
[12:58] and realizing that Iran exports two
[13:00] billion two sorry 2 million barrels of
[13:01] oil a day mostly to China, you know, and
[13:04] if China's choking off your rare earths,
[13:06] maybe you can, you know, help choke off
[13:08] some of their energy, some of their
[13:09] energy supply, right? So it's like
[13:11] another another sort of asymmetric way
[13:12] to kind of, you know, get additional um
[13:14] sort of bargaining power over your main
[13:17] rival, which is China here.
