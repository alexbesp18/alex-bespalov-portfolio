[00:05] Crazy, man. You see that? Uh we we just
[00:08] actually just looked that Dorsy tweeted
[00:11] out that now on Square Terminals you can
[00:14] accept Bitcoin and this is what I've
[00:17] been working on, man. Now this card of
[00:19] mine that has Yeah. Show show the camera
[00:22] maybe so they can see how how awesome
[00:24] this is. So that has laser eyes, right?
[00:27] Incredible. I can actually go to the
[00:30] terminal and pay with this. Isn't that
[00:32] crazy? Like with with this Bitcoin, I
[00:35] just go and like tap to pay. Here's what
[00:37] I love about this because I feel like
[00:39] there's this ongoing narrative or I
[00:41] shouldn't say nar maybe argument about,
[00:43] oh, you know, never sell your Bitcoin
[00:45] or, you know, you don't actually need to
[00:46] use Bitcoin as money because using it as
[00:48] a store of value is is good enough. you
[00:51] obviously have a different opinion on
[00:53] the matter and are actively working on
[00:55] things that uh make it very easy to use
[00:57] as money as easy as using your card. So
[00:59] can we like can we talk about this first
[01:00] of all? What what what is this card for
[01:01] people who don't know? I also want to
[01:03] talk it from a perspective I understand.
[01:05] Yeah. Not everyone is an altruistic
[01:08] idiot like myself. All right. So you
[01:11] spend years developing false software
[01:14] while you could have just uh you know
[01:17] amassed Bitcoin didn't do anything
[01:19] you're up in profits that's it but the
[01:22] thing is PE when people say don't spend
[01:24] your Bitcoin spend fiat actually I see
[01:28] the technical way of how to do that
[01:31] because you can keep your Bitcoin now
[01:34] you're we're getting to the point where
[01:36] you can literally
[01:38] borrow against it infinitely. And as
[01:42] you're doing that, you have dollar
[01:44] balances backed by Bitcoin. And then you
[01:47] can use cards like this that are
[01:50] essentially just authentication key that
[01:53] sends a signal to server transmit this
[01:55] much like uh pay this lightning invoice
[01:59] authorized and and that's all that this
[02:02] is. I uh what I love about uh situation
[02:06] now is now that Square rolls this out.
[02:09] Mhm. Man, you have a lightning node
[02:11] running. Yep. You tie it to bolt cards,
[02:14] you're paying from your lightning node
[02:15] to square. Isn't it insane? And I It's
[02:18] incredible. I don't even want to get in
[02:20] the whole KYC, no KYC. I I think I spoke
[02:25] with Sailor about his bold card that's
[02:28] coming at the conference. So, uh it will
[02:31] be at official conference store
[02:33] releasing tomorrow morning. like I'll
[02:35] I'll uh see if Michael can get his card
[02:40] and use it to pay with Bitcoin and we
[02:44] can set it up so he's spending dollars
[02:45] actually. So So all good, Michael. We
[02:48] you know I mean and either way if he's
[02:50] not spending his Bitcoin maybe
[02:51] presumably he's good with it, right?
[02:52] Well, I mean he's spending Coinbase's
[02:54] Bitcoin, right? There we go. Yeah. But
[02:58] to me, man, that's okay. If you want to
[03:00] have a custodian
[03:01] and you want someone to be responsible,
[03:05] someone you can pressure, okay, that's a
[03:09] bank, but you come tap to pay. Done. I
[03:12] love these cards because I think one of
[03:14] the things that was always uh always
[03:17] hard for people when it comes to
[03:18] understanding Bitcoin, like I was just
[03:19] talking to uh somebody on the flight
[03:21] here to Vegas, nice gal was coming in
[03:24] for a Kenny Chzn concert. Oh my god. and
[03:26] she works as like a financial adviser
[03:28] actually and started chatting up Carl
[03:30] and I and she said you know some of my
[03:32] clients have you know asked me about
[03:33] Bitcoin I don't I don't know like I
[03:35] don't understand it I you know whatever
[03:37] and she's like you know because you
[03:39] can't touch it it's not like physical
[03:41] and and which I always think is such a a
[03:43] weird thing for people to say because
[03:45] first of all it's I was like okay you
[03:47] got cash on you or you you're using a
[03:49] credit card or a debit card debit card
[03:51] okay so so like where where is that you
[03:54] can't touch that either it's just like
[03:55] you just have this physical card, but
[03:57] that makes them think it's it's physical
[03:59] even though there's there's nothing
[04:00] physical about it. This is kind of like
[04:02] I feel like bridges that gap where
[04:04] people then feel, oh, now look, I can
[04:07] touch the Bitcoin, you know, like the
[04:08] bitcoins are in the card and it makes a
[04:11] difference for people. It really does
[04:13] and it's way cooler with laser eyes and
[04:15] experience. I It's so sick. I spoke with
[04:18] Odell about this and I think now that we
[04:22] will be moving from you like get your
[04:24] wallet out uh scan to pay pull the we
[04:28] move to this tap to pay. I think the
[04:31] ultimate frontier is you get this into
[04:33] the phone and then you tap and pay like
[04:36] with Apple Pay and behind all of that is
[04:39] Bitcoin settlement layer. so excited
[04:43] because it took us time man when when
[04:45] you look at mainstream media they were
[04:48] calling us out that uh look at that that
[04:51] there it's a Bitcoin conference but you
[04:53] can't pay with Bitcoin it's onchain it's
[04:55] 10 minutes it's this and that sure but
[04:59] we worked on the technology for last
[05:01] five six seven you know eight years
[05:05] bringing up lightning network and now
[05:07] it's ready now it's literally you have
[05:10] Square like a company that's tens of
[05:12] billions of dollars worth rolling out
[05:14] like hey you remember you you see this
[05:17] that we have at BTC pay open source tab
[05:20] to pay now we have it as well and it's
[05:23] beautiful man to see it that Square
[05:25] announcement is honestly huge because
[05:27] that's something that is used by like so
[05:29] many small businesses especially small
[05:32] merchants you know individuals who
[05:33] aren't running some big enterprise and
[05:35] maybe you know couldn't pay for whatever
[05:37] expensive POS software and hardware
[05:39] terminals were were out there and Square
[05:42] filled like a definite need for them.
[05:44] Now they're coming in and across all of
[05:46] the I don't know how many how many
[05:48] merchant users they have, but it's a
[05:49] mass it's an insane number. Now anyone
[05:53] can pay with Bitcoin at those. And I
[05:54] feel like that that just breaks down so
[05:56] many walls that were up there before
[05:59] where it's really easy to say, well,
[06:00] okay, if you know the classic argument,
[06:02] if Bitcoin's money, then why can't we
[06:04] spend it anywhere? And you know,
[06:06] speaking of people who say that, I see
[06:07] Peter Schiff walking by right now.
[06:09] Maybe, maybe he'll stop in. We'll see.
[06:12] Gold is old, Peter. Gold is old. No, no,
[06:16] he's ignoring he's a man on a mission. A
[06:19] very cool shirt, though. Very cool
[06:20] shirt. I'll give him that. But, you
[06:22] know, it takes away those arguments
[06:23] where you say, "Well, why can't I spend
[06:25] it anywhere?" And it's like, now now you
[06:26] can spend it anywhere. And one thing,
[06:28] all of these merchants are now stacking
[06:31] sets. Mhm. Right. as you're like a mom
[06:34] and pop shop that's that's moving to
[06:37] Bitcoin standard and suddenly your
[06:39] purchasing power is increasing over the
[06:42] the the time. It's no longer because we
[06:44] we say like Bitcoin is not a get quick
[06:47] rich scheme. It's don't get poor slowly
[06:50] scheme because and Sailor has that. The
[06:53] people that use fiat currencies as
[06:55] money, we call them poor. It's just
[06:58] you're diluted every day, man. It is it
[07:00] is a it is a great quote. Yeah. and uh
[07:02] made it into a really banger uh banger
[07:05] house track too as well. It's it's a
[07:07] great it's a great sample remix. We need
[07:09] to add this to the video. Yeah,
[07:11] absolutely. So, now you've got the
[07:13] ability to use these cards. Can for
[07:14] anybody maybe can you give the the
[07:16] highlevel uh technical of like how that
[07:19] actually work without like like this is
[07:21] this is a b a bolt card. Who cares? Like
[07:23] you mean like two developers out of
[07:25] every screw. Okay. So, okay. I'll tell
[07:28] the point it works. Yeah. But anyone
[07:31] that wants to replicate this setup,
[07:34] install BTC pay server. Uh Nicholas
[07:37] Dorier, Emperor Nicholas, uh who founded
[07:40] BTC pay server, he created this bold
[07:42] card bank plugin. So if you want to on
[07:46] board your family on uh Bitcoin
[07:49] standard, you get these bolt cards, you
[07:51] give everyone allowance like this card
[07:53] is 20,000 sats or 20,000 bitcoins. We
[07:58] won't know soon. Walker like renamed
[08:00] Satoshi. We might have to get into that
[08:02] a little bit. Yeah. But the thing is you
[08:04] get like five of these cards, you have
[08:06] five members of your family. Go like
[08:09] spend go buy uh stake and shake tap to
[08:13] pay Bitcoin standard and we get
[08:16] corporations to stack SATs as well. And
[08:19] I'm telling you, man, this as Pomp says
[08:21] rocket ship is is leaving man. It's this
[08:25] time. Yeah. For real. It's actually I
[08:28] want to sidebar quick way to the Steak
[08:29] and Shake thing because I think this is
[08:30] honestly like inc like first of all it's
[08:33] cool. Um I I enjoy Steak and Shake. I
[08:36] enjoyed them even more when they put
[08:38] tallow uh on instead of every like
[08:40] incredible incredible. Uh and then now
[08:44] they have integrated Bitcoin where you
[08:46] can like I literally went and I I bought
[08:47] a burger and fries and actually I got a
[08:49] Frisco melt a Frisco melt kind of guy
[08:52] and fries and and a shake, you know, and
[08:53] everything and I paid in Bitcoin and it
[08:55] was easy. And it's kind of incredible
[08:57] like it's an incredible marketing tactic
[08:59] for them as well because they get so
[09:02] much free advertising now from all the
[09:04] toxic psychopaths on the internet who
[09:07] are like this is really cool. I just
[09:08] went and bought Steak and Shake with
[09:10] Bitcoin. This is a huge franchise
[09:12] nationwide. I mean, do you think we
[09:14] start to see more of this like as these
[09:16] like the tools have gotten better now?
[09:18] The tools have gotten way better even
[09:19] than a couple years ago. I haven't been
[09:21] in as as long as you, but like I've seen
[09:23] this progression and it's amazing. Do
[09:25] you think we start to see more of
[09:26] businesses do this? I think we're at
[09:28] the, you know, that critical point,
[09:31] critical juncture. It's literally like
[09:33] this conference, man. Now that Square
[09:34] has announced, I think that's it
[09:37] because you know, you know how it is.
[09:40] You've been in Bitcoin, as you say, like
[09:41] maybe not as long as we, but you're
[09:43] getting few years now. Yeah. You had the
[09:45] whole, "Oh, you're crypto couple. You're
[09:47] not Bitcoin couple. Everyone hating."
[09:50] And when we met at Beef Steak, Josh at
[09:52] Beef Steak, I I think I told you the
[09:54] same thing actually. But but I like then
[09:57] get telling everyone like, "Hey, it
[09:59] takes time." Yeah. Because everyone just
[10:02] like people look at this video, they say
[10:03] like, "What is this masked guy doing?"
[10:06] But then they research, they're like,
[10:08] "Oh, oh, like these guys, they're like
[10:11] somehow improving their lives and
[10:14] getting wealthier as they do it." Like I
[10:16] want that. I want that for me. I want
[10:18] that for my family. And I'm telling you,
[10:21] when we were memeing this, like I
[10:23] remember Bitstein uh doing the whole fix
[10:26] the money, fix the world. They're like,
[10:28] "Yeah, right." Like, "How will you fix
[10:30] it?" And we're like, "We will fix it. We
[10:32] will fix the money with Bitcoin. We'll
[10:34] fix the world." They're like, "Yeah,
[10:35] right." Like bunch of freaks online like
[10:38] geeks. But now people are like, "Oh,
[10:41] they're actually doing it. They're
[10:42] fixing money. It's fixing food supply
[10:45] because seed oils poison. It's just you
[10:50] you get all the the bloating
[10:52] mitochondria, you know, probably better
[10:54] than me. I just stuffing yourself full
[10:56] of an industrial lubricant basically
[10:58] that was packaged as some somehow a
[11:00] food. I watched Yeah. your videos. I I
[11:03] like followed your post and I'm like,
[11:04] "Okay, let me try not to eat like seed
[11:08] oils."
[11:09] Oh, actually I feel you know less like
[11:13] bloated and and all of that. Like it's
[11:15] almost like you're you're you're having
[11:17] infection, man. Like I don't know how
[11:19] how to explain it. It's a it's a fiat
[11:21] infection really. It's like something
[11:22] that's that's totally avoidable and
[11:24] should never have happened but somehow
[11:26] because of this fiat system that we live
[11:28] in where everything needs to, you know,
[11:30] you got to hide the inflation by making
[11:32] stuff. Metabolism slows down. Yeah. Like
[11:36] it's
[11:37] like it's amazing to see it is a company
[11:40] do that though to say no no no no seed
[11:42] oils anymore like we're not going to
[11:43] poison our customers. That's great. More
[11:45] of that please.
