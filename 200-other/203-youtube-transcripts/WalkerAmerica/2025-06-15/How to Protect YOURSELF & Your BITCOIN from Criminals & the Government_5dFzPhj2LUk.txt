[00:00] Self-s sovereignty in Bitcoin is an
[00:02] extension of the American political
[00:04] tradition. It is in line with what the
[00:08] founding fathers fought for the same
[00:10] sort of principles. I have no doubt that
[00:13] if they were alive today, they would be
[00:15] Bitcoiners. America is really the only
[00:18] place that Bitcoin has a true chance of
[00:20] success. And it's because of the
[00:23] powerful constitutional protections that
[00:25] we have and the ability of the
[00:27] sovereignty of individual states to
[00:30] counteract a rogue federal government
[00:32] and using those powers to balance
[00:34] against one another. We feel like
[00:35] there's a very very powerful apparatus
[00:37] to be able to resist state overreach.
[00:40] And furthermore, the United States is
[00:42] one of the only places that you actually
[00:44] are entitled to the castle doctrine,
[00:46] which means that if someone is coming
[00:47] into your home intent on violence and
[00:50] wanting to rob you or cause harm against
[00:53] you or your property, you do have a
[00:55] right to engage in deadly force against
[00:58] those individuals. And we believe that
[01:01] this is going to become a very key and
[01:03] critical aspect of being able to provide
[01:06] the self-s sovereignty. But as the price
[01:08] of Bitcoin goes up and as it continues
[01:10] to go up, we need to take self-s
[01:12] sovereignty to the next level and we
[01:15] need much more robust products and also
[01:19] frankly more expensive products because
[01:22] you know you wouldn't buy a $100 safe
[01:24] off of Amazon and put a million dollars
[01:26] in it. But that's kind of what
[01:28] Bitcoiners are doing with their hardware
[01:30] wallets. We now exist at this end state
[01:33] where the law is a highly dysfunctional
[01:35] thing and if somebody does choose to rob
[01:37] you legal or otherwise, in other words,
[01:40] the state choosing to steal from you or
[01:42] criminals, it's not clear if justice
[01:44] will actually be delivered. And that's
[01:46] one of the reasons that we really
[01:47] believe that we need to start empowering
[01:49] ourselves and taking this into our own
[01:51] hands. Because if we allow for ourselves
[01:54] to get to a hyper bitcoinized world
[01:56] without a product like this, it's going
[01:58] to be much more threatening, difficult,
[02:00] and scary. And the truth is is it's
[02:02] going to be much more violent. And it's
[02:03] going to be much more violent because we
[02:05] won't have active deterrent solutions
[02:08] that people will know and understand and
[02:10] will be branded towards that. We live in
[02:12] the future basically like we we're we're
[02:14] already in the hyper bitcoinized world
[02:16] and we're just working backwards from
[02:18] there and we think that's something that
[02:21] almost no Bitcoin company and and few
[02:24] Bitcoiners really have the conviction
[02:27] about hyper Bitcoinization and really
[02:29] take it seriously and really believe
[02:31] with 100% certainty that that's where
[02:34] we're headed that that is going to
[02:36] happen that there's going to be massive
[02:38] disruption because of it. That's our
[02:40] base case. We're we we know that's
[02:42] happening for sure.
[02:49] Man, I'm just like so impressed with
[02:50] this podcast setup. I know. This is a
[02:52] huge upgrade for us. Yeah. Like now I
[02:54] need to be podcasting more. Yes. Yes,
[02:58] you do. Like that's I think that's
[03:00] that's really that should be the
[03:01] takeaway from any podcast that you do is
[03:04] maybe I should do more podcasts. And
[03:06] like that's kind of how I feel a lot of
[03:08] the time. Literally, I'm of the opinion
[03:10] and I've I've said this to you before,
[03:11] but we don't until we have more Bitcoin
[03:14] podcasts than Trads.
[03:16] We don't have enough bit Bitcoin
[03:18] podcasts. Like, there are so many just
[03:20] absolute morons out there telling people
[03:22] like, "You should here's the top 10
[03:24] dividend stocks you should buy so you
[03:26] can retire retire early." And it's like,
[03:29] no, no, God, flood the market with
[03:31] Bitcoin podcasts until we have
[03:33] absolutely eviscerated all of the trads.
[03:36] The thing that amazes me about the
[03:38] Tradfi podcast is that um they're like
[03:41] like Bitcoin's a scam. You couldn't do
[03:43] this. And it's like like I've
[03:45] objectively made magnitudes more money
[03:47] than you have. But like you have the
[03:49] audacity to tell me that you know better
[03:52] at how this works than me. Who is that
[03:55] one guy Dave Ramsey who like he's like
[03:57] you know you know that guy he recently
[03:59] like started to come around to Bitcoin
[04:01] but something about him uh in in
[04:03] Romanian and I say Romanian because my
[04:05] wife is Romanian they have an expression
[04:07] called uh it's karach palme it means a
[04:10] face that begs for a slapping and I feel
[04:13] like that applies really well to him
[04:14] like it's just like something about his
[04:16] face you're like I just I just want to
[04:19] give you one of these. There's like a
[04:21] smuggness that I think uh is one of the
[04:23] ingredients there. Well, that's like the
[04:25] whole engine that like makes Bitcoin
[04:27] work is like the the mixture of
[04:29] smuggness and hubris that like has
[04:31] people scoff in rejection towards
[04:34] Bitcoin. Yeah. You're a Bitcoin person.
[04:39] Oh, exactly. The kind of response I
[04:42] would expect for somebody with Bitcoin
[04:44] in their bio is something I I get on so
[04:47] many of my like posts, especially if I'm
[04:50] like trolling a politician. They're
[04:52] like, "Well, wouldn't expect you to take
[04:54] it seriously, Mr. Bitcoin man." It's
[04:56] like, "You're right. I I don't I think
[05:00] you're absurd, but that's beside the
[05:03] point." You guys are coming from the
[05:05] Prescidio. Uh so, shout out to uh
[05:07] Prescidio Bitcoin for giving you guys
[05:09] this sweet spot. I lived in the
[05:10] Prescidio for uh for a summer once back
[05:13] in 2012 when I was working in the Bay
[05:16] Area. I might have actually lived in the
[05:18] Presidio at the same time. No [ __ ]
[05:21] way. Seriously? Yeah. Damn. I was in a
[05:24] house with like seven dudes. The house
[05:26] was built for probably two people. Um it
[05:30] was it was dirty. Um but we had a good
[05:32] time. We had a good time. Yeah. I lived
[05:34] in a house with a bunch of alcoholics. I
[05:36] remember there was one day I came home
[05:37] and I tried to open the door and it like
[05:39] wouldn't open. So I like went around
[05:41] back to like look through the window and
[05:42] my roommate was covered in [ __ ] like
[05:44] passed out naked up against the door and
[05:48] apparently he had fell down the stairs
[05:52] and then passed out up against the door.
[05:54] So that was Yeah, it was like a very
[05:57] severe alcoholic culture house. And
[05:59] that's when I was like do I have a
[06:01] drinking problem? And I was like m I
[06:03] think so. Were we living in the same
[06:05] house?
[06:07] Because that that eerily describes my
[06:10] experience there, too. But I I think I
[06:12] was part of the problem. So, I I never
[06:14] uh never woke up with with [ __ ] all over
[06:17] me, though. So, at least there's that
[06:19] you remember.
[06:21] Well, touche. Touche.
[06:23] But yeah, there was a there was a few
[06:25] times I woke up in places that I don't
[06:26] know how I got there, and I was like,
[06:28] maybe maybe I shouldn't drink so
[06:30] heavily.
[06:31] San Francisco was an was interesting
[06:34] there. I I I was there for that summer
[06:37] and then I think let's the next summer I
[06:40] was in uh in San Jose and so I got like
[06:43] a you know decent little toe dipping
[06:47] into the Bay Area and like around that
[06:49] time like I remember uh I don't remember
[06:51] the homeless problem being what I see it
[06:55] reported on the news today as uh I
[06:58] remember it being generally pretty I
[07:00] mean it's like it's San Francisco too so
[07:02] it's like it's funky and weird
[07:04] But like it felt like it was in a good
[07:06] way at that time. I don't know what the
[07:08] vibe there is now. How how does it feel
[07:10] to you just like having been there for
[07:12] like you know a number of years? Um my
[07:15] experience is like peak peak homeless
[07:19] problem was probably right around before
[07:21] CO. Uh the city's cleaned up a bit since
[07:25] then in my opinion. Um it's definitely
[07:28] worse than it was at that time. Um, I
[07:32] think the truth is is like there like
[07:34] the the like I just signed a lease for a
[07:36] new place and just like rent here is
[07:38] absurd and so like there's a lot of uh
[07:41] like full-time working living homeless
[07:43] people and so like that then coorberates
[07:46] with the mental health issues and like
[07:48] it's a gigantic mess and nightmare that
[07:50] uh without fixing the money there's like
[07:53] no conceivable way of like how we
[07:54] actually address this problem in a
[07:56] meaningful way, right? Yeah. I mean, I
[07:59] think uh I've heard some people talk
[08:01] about how um you know, the expensive
[08:04] real estate in San Francisco
[08:07] um stays higher by there being bad
[08:10] neighborhoods or homelessness problems
[08:12] because it means there's more of a
[08:14] premium on the nice parts of town. So
[08:17] there's sort of a perverse incentive to
[08:19] perpetuate the problem which does kind
[08:22] of relate to homes being a store of
[08:25] value because people are trying to
[08:27] escape fiat debasement. So yet again
[08:31] Bitcoin uh fixes this.
[08:34] You know, I feel like uh just with
[08:37] Bitcoin now being uh almost like feeling
[08:41] almost mainstream, like you know, it's
[08:42] that it's that indie band that you knew
[08:44] before they were cool. Uh and now you're
[08:46] like, "Yeah, okay. Well, you know, all
[08:48] you guys are just posers." Uh but like
[08:51] now that we're at this stage and we say,
[08:54] you know, we continue to say things like
[08:55] Bitcoin fixes this and mean them very
[08:57] sincerely, it feels like I don't know
[09:00] about you guys, like you've been in
[09:01] longer than I have. like maybe this is
[09:03] just like this eternal September and you
[09:05] guys have been feeling this forever, but
[09:07] like it just feels like the the new
[09:10] batch of people just maybe just don't
[09:12] get that. like are they in it for the
[09:15] fiat gains in case and this is something
[09:16] that you know you've talked about a lot
[09:18] like the people that are trying to
[09:20] acquire more Bitcoin versus the people
[09:23] who are fundamentally trying to acquire
[09:24] more fiat and that being a like you
[09:27] those being actually diametrically
[09:29] opposed but perhaps both in service of
[09:32] Bitcoin in the long run. I don't know.
[09:34] Well, this is what the hilarious like
[09:36] number go up meme with the Trojan horse
[09:38] is is that like yeah like you'll totally
[09:41] get a $10 million Bitcoin. Like you also
[09:43] don't understand that like that means
[09:45] that the entire economy like is in
[09:48] significant and severe crisis. And
[09:50] furthermore like real Bitcoin like when
[09:53] when the ticker says Bitcoin's at $10
[09:54] million a bitcoin that means that
[09:57] self-custody Bitcoin is now at $30
[09:59] million a bitcoin. And this price
[10:01] differential is apparent in something.
[10:03] And like that's that's something that
[10:05] like anybody who went through Mount Gaus
[10:07] knows is like the price of Mount Gaus
[10:09] Bitcoin was much lower than the price of
[10:12] non-mount Gauss Bitcoin. And I was and a
[10:15] lot of people were like, "Oh, I can like
[10:17] I can like arbit it up on like getting
[10:20] this nice cheap corn and like no problem
[10:22] with that at all." And I was like maybe
[10:25] there's a price signal here that you
[10:27] don't fully understand.
[10:29] So I I think they're both they both are
[10:33] in service of each other. And I just
[10:34] think it's a deep irony of that like
[10:36] that's why this cycle we've found
[10:38] ourselves in bed uh like essentially
[10:40] with the financeers and the politicians
[10:42] cuz we're like yeah you can totally get
[10:44] rich off Bitcoin. They're like yeah like
[10:46] yeah it's going to like destroy
[10:47] everything that you've worked to build
[10:48] but you'll totally get rich off it. And
[10:50] they're like yeah I don't really
[10:52] understand that first point but who
[10:54] [ __ ] cares? Bring the horse into
[10:55] Troy. Like thanks guys. Yeah. And I mean
[10:59] I I don't think this applies to
[11:01] everybody, but the orange pill is very
[11:04] real. And I think a lot of people who've
[11:06] come in surely purely because they're
[11:09] interested in the price gains. Just by
[11:12] owning Bitcoin and learning more about
[11:14] it and getting more involved, it starts
[11:17] to change your perspective. you start
[11:20] learning about Austrian economics and
[11:24] all kinds of things that you know you
[11:26] never thought you would be thinking
[11:28] about. And so for some percentage of
[11:31] that crowd like their views are going to
[11:34] change over time even if that wasn't the
[11:37] original motivation.
[11:39] It is kind of that beautiful thing like
[11:41] you know again just let's throw out all
[11:43] the cliches like you don't change
[11:44] Bitcoin, Bitcoin changes you, right? you
[11:46] know, and it but it's like it's kind of
[11:48] true. And like uh Eric, I got to say one
[11:51] I think my favorite moment from the
[11:53] conference in Vegas was like I happen to
[11:55] be walking by Carlo was at the ladies
[11:57] brunch. I'm walking by the news desk. I
[11:59] see you up there and I'm like, well, I'm
[12:02] I'm obviously just going to find a seat
[12:04] and sit around, you know, stick around
[12:06] for this because I'm going to enjoy it.
[12:08] and they're asking some questions, you
[12:10] know, and they and they they they go to
[12:11] you and it's, you know, Eric, what do
[12:13] you think about I'm paraphrasing here,
[12:14] but you know, the uh basically like the
[12:17] corporatization of Bitcoin or like, you
[12:18] know, or the America, you know, US
[12:20] government also is starting to, you
[12:21] know, take a keen interest in this
[12:23] strategic reserve, etc., etc. And you're
[12:25] like, well, I just like to start off by
[12:27] saying, [ __ ] the state. Um, and like you
[12:29] went on from there and I was like, "God,
[12:31] that was just that was just kind of
[12:33] perfect because it at this time where
[12:35] like you've never seen so many suits at
[12:38] a Bitcoin conference." And again, I've
[12:39] only been going to them for a few years
[12:41] and like I've seen the difference in the
[12:43] number of suits, it was very refreshing.
[12:45] So, I just wanted to thank you for that
[12:47] publicly. Thank you. I I think a lot of
[12:49] people appreciated that. I was uh you
[12:52] know, truth be told, I I was pretty
[12:54] significantly disappointed to see just
[12:57] uh how much sick ofantry was going on.
[13:00] Uh and the other one, you know, like I
[13:03] said that at the same time, like it's
[13:04] really important for people to
[13:05] understand like it doesn't matter what
[13:07] the US government does. Like what
[13:08] matters is that like you get yourself on
[13:10] a Bitcoin standard and you have your own
[13:12] Bitcoin treasury and that you tell all
[13:14] of your friends and family like that you
[13:16] can actually own Bitcoin. It's important
[13:18] because you can escape from the endemic
[13:21] and awful inflation. And even more
[13:23] importantly, like you know, uh I'm
[13:26] pretty sure the last time that I was on
[13:27] your podcast, I pointed this out as like
[13:29] you could have listened to us and bought
[13:30] some and like your wealth would have
[13:32] appreciated by like 30% since then. And
[13:35] like every time I talked to you, we'll
[13:37] probably have this conversation again.
[13:38] And like it's I have a lot of empathy
[13:41] cuz like it's really difficult to
[13:42] understand uh the deflationary nature of
[13:45] Bitcoin against like a highly
[13:47] inflationary world. But like this is
[13:49] also part of orange pilling and why it
[13:51] changes our value set is cuz like we
[13:53] start to understand that like
[13:56] it's just really important to understand
[13:58] like we've lived inside of a global
[14:01] Keynesian economic world for 70 years
[14:04] where governments made the decision that
[14:06] they were going to essentially overthrow
[14:07] economies everywhere and make everything
[14:10] inflationary and have their hand in
[14:11] everything. And Bitcoin's like the one
[14:13] solution we have to that. Uh and that
[14:15] like works without the state. And in
[14:17] fact like it's so powerful and it is
[14:19] deflationary because of how much the
[14:21] state has messed up the general economic
[14:24] functions with fiat. And uh yeah I I
[14:28] find it pretty interesting cuz like in a
[14:30] lot of ways uh
[14:32] like this is why I got into the
[14:34] philosophy is that like I think marrying
[14:36] all of this stuff up and really
[14:37] understanding like well like what is
[14:39] this bigger idea of value? Like is value
[14:41] just money? Like is it just economic
[14:42] exchange? And like how how do we really
[14:44] determine that? And like why is that so
[14:47] important? And I think that once you
[14:49] start to realize like oh Bitcoin is
[14:52] actually like a monumental societal
[14:54] level shift where we're moving from a
[14:57] fiat governmentowned economic world into
[15:01] a digital self-s sovereign world where
[15:03] we truly get to make the choice to have
[15:06] sovereignty through cryptography. like
[15:08] that that actually has a capacity to
[15:10] change the totality of human history
[15:13] itself and like where we choose to take
[15:16] the trajectory of humanity towards.
[15:19] Yeah. And this this actually reminds me
[15:21] of one of my favorite pieces by Eric uh
[15:23] called the encrypted meaning of crypto
[15:26] because it's all about how like the true
[15:28] meaning of Bitcoin encrypts itself very
[15:32] strategically and it's actually in the
[15:35] interest of Bitcoin like in terms of its
[15:38] deeper purposes
[15:40] um that it's not totally apparent and
[15:42] that actually masquerades as a scam or
[15:46] as an investment vehicle or now that
[15:49] people have convinced them it's it's a
[15:51] tool for state power and it can be used,
[15:53] you know, to to prop up the dollar or
[15:57] all these fantasies that people have,
[15:59] even the the shitcoins and all of that.
[16:02] It it's better that people think it's a
[16:05] joke or it's a scam or, you know, it can
[16:08] be used for all these purposes than to
[16:10] truly understand the deeper and more
[16:13] substantial things that are at stake.
[16:15] Because if that was crystal clear to
[16:18] everyone, then it would be much easier
[16:21] to oppose it and there would be way more
[16:23] interest in stopping it. But the fact
[16:25] that it doesn't look like that to most
[16:28] people means that the true political
[16:31] revolution that it represents can move
[16:35] forward unimpeded because its real
[16:37] meaning is protected by this form of
[16:40] cryptography
[16:42] um that hides what's really at stake.
[16:45] Do you think that uh this is something
[16:48] I've heard Michael Sailor say I'm sure
[16:50] he's not I maybe he was the first I
[16:52] don't know I'm guessing not though uh
[16:54] but he's elaborated on it a lot which is
[16:56] the idea that Bitcoin is a virus and
[16:59] like what you're both describing is
[17:01] basically a viral mutation right it's uh
[17:04] a virus being able to adapt and to
[17:06] change what it looks like and how it
[17:08] presents to be able to uh basically
[17:12] infect more hosts and virus as like a
[17:14] negative ative connotation but it's like
[17:15] it's a very efficient biological
[17:17] mechanism right it's a very quote
[17:19] intelligent biological mechanism without
[17:21] being uh conscious let's say which is
[17:25] kind of I like you could describe
[17:26] Bitcoin in that way it's it's
[17:28] intelligent but it's obviously not
[17:30] conscious like it presents in these
[17:32] different ways like I don't know is is
[17:35] Bitcoin is Bitcoin a virus that is just
[17:37] bound to infect us all with like with
[17:39] good stuff though it's not like a you
[17:40] know something that was created in a lab
[17:42] in Wuhan it's like Hey, sound money. You
[17:45] get a, you know, you don't even need to
[17:47] be vaccinated against it. Like, it's
[17:48] just good. Like, I don't know. Well, you
[17:52] could. Yeah. I mean, absolutely. And I
[17:54] and I think this is this has happened
[17:56] throughout history, you know, like, you
[17:58] know, you you cannot stop an idea whose
[18:01] time has come. And the most powerful
[18:04] forces in the world are the memes. Like
[18:07] the the idea of freedom, right? Before
[18:10] we had Bitcoin, like in the 1700s, the
[18:14] idea of freedom was viral and and people
[18:17] couldn't forget it and they and they
[18:19] started to realize like, yeah, why why
[18:21] should we give all our power to the
[18:23] state if if the state is unjust? We have
[18:25] a right of revolution and we can create
[18:27] something better. And no matter how many
[18:29] guns or violence or coercion is brought
[18:32] to bear to stop that idea, its
[18:36] propagation
[18:38] moves unimpeded. So that is Bitcoin is
[18:41] just the latest example of this
[18:44] phenomenon that has continued to
[18:46] liberate humanity throughout all of
[18:48] history.
[18:50] Yeah. Like I I truly think what Bitcoin
[18:52] is is that uh like it's the reconnection
[18:55] of the spark that like truly is like
[18:57] thought itself and intelligence as you
[19:00] called it. And it's because uh like
[19:02] inside fiat world which fiat means by
[19:04] decree. It's really important to
[19:06] understand that like most forms of logic
[19:09] that people apply are are actually these
[19:11] highly authoritarian
[19:13] ideas that have masqueraded as being
[19:16] thought when they're not at all. And
[19:17] just trying to talk to anybody about
[19:19] basic economic principles like that
[19:21] starts to really display itself. But
[19:23] it's even it starts to get even wider
[19:26] with that because it's like look like
[19:27] thought itself sort of needs to have
[19:29] like a long chain of logic that like can
[19:32] that can connect to itself and be
[19:34] self-reerential in a holistic framework.
[19:37] And like the truth is is like if you
[19:39] look at the fiat economic system like it
[19:41] it breaks down at some point where it's
[19:43] self-reerential feature trying to point
[19:45] back to itself goes uh actually we like
[19:47] made all that [ __ ] up and like uh turns
[19:49] out that like we built this on sand. And
[19:52] so I think the thing that happens for a
[19:53] lot of people is they go whoa like
[19:55] there's this like form of logic that
[19:56] could make an economic system and like
[19:58] it turns out that like you can actually
[20:00] like think about that through this
[20:01] proofof work concept and I think that's
[20:04] what then starts to actually transform
[20:05] people and I think that's why we've
[20:07] spoke a lot about like this sort of
[20:08] rescue from nihilism is that uh before
[20:12] really understanding bitcoin you can be
[20:14] like how could we ever win everything's
[20:15] totally dark like this place is is
[20:17] really bad and abusive and exploitative.
[20:21] And then you realize, oh, like I can own
[20:23] this thing that I truly own much more
[20:25] than I own anything else that's ever
[20:27] existed. Uh, and furthermore, like it
[20:30] dignifies me in a new and different way
[20:32] through like quote unquote human rights.
[20:34] But like this is my right to encryption.
[20:37] Like you there's literally nothing
[20:39] anyone can do about it. Like if I choose
[20:41] to encrypt my information and data, that
[20:44] is something that is given to me very
[20:47] directly through the form of logic that
[20:48] like is the network. And now that we've
[20:51] collectivized that with each other, like
[20:53] that, this is really sort of what the
[20:55] thesis of my book is about is like that
[20:57] that is cryptographic sovereignty, which
[21:00] I truncated to crypto sovereignty to be
[21:02] tongue-in-cheek towards both crypto, but
[21:04] also to essentially make a new idiom
[21:08] that I think is really important in that
[21:10] like we can truly achieve a new form of
[21:12] sovereignty through cryptography. And
[21:14] it's really interesting because like
[21:16] it's not doing it through violence or
[21:18] any other means. that's actually doing
[21:19] it through an inverting of the order and
[21:21] just being a total refusal to
[21:23] participate within those other systems.
[21:27] If you're stuck spending dollars, at
[21:29] least stop earning dirty fiat rewards.
[21:33] Use Fold to earn Bitcoin on everyday
[21:35] purchases and regular expenses,
[21:38] groceries, bills, travel, home
[21:40] improvement. I literally just earned
[21:42] 2,203
[21:44] SATs buying a $100 Amazon gift card on
[21:47] Fold. You don't even need to use the
[21:49] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[21:51] You can connect your favorite credit
[21:53] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[21:56] on merchant offers. Or go allin. Make
[21:59] Fold the center of your personal
[22:01] finances. Buy, earn, save, and even get
[22:05] paid in Bitcoin with Fold. Head to the
[22:07] link in the show notes to get started
[22:09] with the ultimate savings toolkit or go
[22:12] directly to use.foldapp.com/r/walker.
[22:14] foldapp.com/r/walker
[22:17] and get yourself $10 in Bitcoin when you
[22:20] sign up. Let's talk about using Bitcoin
[22:23] the way it's meant to be used.
[22:25] Self-custodial, lightning fast, and
[22:28] ready for the real world. That's exactly
[22:30] what BitKit wallet is all about. Bitkit
[22:33] wallet is a clean, powerful Bitcoin and
[22:36] Lightning mobile wallet that gives you
[22:38] full control onchain and on Lightning.
[22:42] You hold the keys always. Whether you're
[22:45] brand new or are a seasoned Bitcoiner,
[22:48] BitKit's intuitive wallet design makes
[22:50] it simple to send, receive, and manage
[22:53] your SATs. Quick Pay lets you fire off
[22:56] Lightning payments faster than ever, and
[22:58] seamless integration between Onchain and
[23:01] Lightning means your funds are always
[23:03] where you need them. It's your daily
[23:06] driver Bitcoin and Lightning wallet, and
[23:08] it actually feels good to use it. And
[23:11] with modular widgets, you can
[23:13] personalize your experience to match
[23:15] your style. There's even a lightning
[23:18] node running right on your phone. No
[23:21] custodians, no compromises. Go to
[23:24] bitkit.
[23:27] Or search bitkit wallet in your app
[23:29] store and start using Bitcoin like it's
[23:32] meant to be used. That's bit ti.
[23:38] I am definitely not a trader. I'm trying
[23:40] to hold my Bitcoin for the long term.
[23:42] And if you're like me, you need to make
[23:44] sure you keep that Bitcoin safe by going
[23:46] to bitbox.swiss/walker
[23:49] and using the promo code Walker for 5%
[23:52] off the fully open-source Bitcoin only
[23:55] Bitbox O2 hardware wallet. Then get your
[23:58] Bitcoin off the exchange and into your
[24:00] own self-custody. Bitcoin is chop
[24:03] consolidating right around 100K, but we
[24:05] have companies, nation states, and a
[24:07] whole lot of plebs like you and me who
[24:09] are stacking harder than ever. So, it's
[24:12] going to keep ripping higher. But now is
[24:14] the best time for you to get your
[24:16] security locked down tight with Bitbox.
[24:19] Plus, and I can't emphasize this enough,
[24:21] the Bitbox O2 is just easy as hell to
[24:24] use. Whether you're brand new to
[24:25] Bitcoin, it's your first time setting up
[24:26] a hardware wallet, so you're a little
[24:28] bit nervous, it's understandable, or you
[24:30] are a well seasoned psychopath, you will
[24:32] have no problem with the Bitbox. And
[24:34] again, it's fully open source and
[24:36] Bitcoin only, but you don't have to
[24:38] trust me. You can go and verify that for
[24:40] yourself on their GitHub. When you go to
[24:43] bitbox.swiss/walker
[24:45] and use the promo code walker, not only
[24:47] do you get 5% off, but you also help
[24:50] support this podcast. So, thank you. I'm
[24:53] curious also and this uh somewhat
[24:55] transitions us into the topic at hand,
[24:57] but I is that one of the primary drivers
[25:01] for you guys building out Vora basically
[25:04] to fill that gap because and I don't
[25:07] want I don't want to steal any thunder
[25:08] here, but like without having the
[25:11] ability to actually uh be protected
[25:14] against super basic [ __ ] attacks
[25:18] against your body and your Bitcoin and
[25:20] like potentially losing it through that
[25:22] like can you even make the claim that
[25:24] you are sovereign like if you cannot be
[25:27] protected against this most basic thing
[25:29] is is that like am I kind of in the
[25:31] right track there yeah 100% that's it
[25:35] and you know in a lot of ways we we have
[25:39] the promise of self- sovereignty right
[25:41] now but not the reality of it and that's
[25:44] why we founded Vora is to make self-
[25:47] sovereignty real and not just a lar and
[25:50] not just something that people do but
[25:52] maybe feel really vulnerable about. And
[25:56] you know, the the existing systems were
[25:58] great for Bitcoin's early days when the
[26:00] price of Bitcoin was lower, but as the
[26:03] price of Bitcoin goes up and as it
[26:05] continues to go up, we need to take
[26:08] self- sovereignty to the next level. And
[26:10] we need much more robust products and
[26:14] also frankly more expensive products
[26:16] because you know you wouldn't buy a $100
[26:19] safe off of Amazon and put a million
[26:21] dollars in it. But that's kind of what
[26:23] Bitcoiners are doing with their hardware
[26:25] wallets. Like we need systems that
[26:28] aren't subject to hardware supply chain
[26:30] attacks where you can verify the
[26:32] hardware. We need systems that extend
[26:34] into personal security, home security.
[26:37] So, we're protecting people, not just
[26:39] keys, because we're seeing wrench
[26:41] attacks go up, and they're really scary,
[26:44] and they're going to get worse over
[26:45] time. And so, it's not enough to just
[26:48] protect the keys. We need systems that
[26:50] can stop and intervene when there are
[26:53] attacks, that can deter attacks. We also
[26:56] need ways of having recovery systems
[26:58] where you can put keys in multiple
[27:00] places, but without being subject to a
[27:03] 6102 attack. Because what a lot of
[27:05] Bitcoiners are doing right now is
[27:07] they're putting a threshold of keys in
[27:09] KYC safe deposit boxes and those can be
[27:13] just trivially seized. And so when we
[27:16] look around at the landscape and you
[27:18] know I've I've worked on key management
[27:20] and self-custody for a long time. I was
[27:22] at Coinbase for four and a half years
[27:25] working on key management and cold
[27:27] storage and multi-party computation. I
[27:29] just left the BitKey team. I was there
[27:31] for almost three years and I'm looking
[27:34] around at all these solutions and just
[27:36] feeling like they're not getting the job
[27:39] done. And so that's why we we founded
[27:43] the company. And it and it also has this
[27:46] philosophical foundation where it's
[27:48] directly inspired by Eric's writings, by
[27:51] the vision that he's put out in terms of
[27:53] what is the deeper meaning that's at
[27:55] stake with Bitcoin, that it is more than
[27:58] number goes up, that it is about self-
[28:00] sovereignty, that it is about
[28:01] transforming our political systems. And
[28:04] so that's where it's a real bringing
[28:05] together of this philosophical
[28:08] foundation and technical innovation to
[28:11] make self-s sovereignty real for the
[28:14] hyper bitcoinized world.
[28:18] Yeah. Yeah. And I feel very strongly
[28:20] that uh you know like VOR really came
[28:23] about from me and Jesse's conversations
[28:26] of uh you know both ourselves and many
[28:30] friends have worked at Bitcoin companies
[28:32] that they are all working towards a
[28:35] particular mission but as they grow and
[28:37] get bigger that mission starts to dilute
[28:39] and more and more people join the
[28:41] company who aren't frankly for better
[28:43] word they're not really Bitcoiners and
[28:45] like they have a different incentive
[28:46] structure and so I've I've seen this
[28:49] repeated story arc with the dozens of
[28:51] people where they're really highly
[28:53] motivated and committed to getting into
[28:55] a Bitcoin company. They start building
[28:57] awesome and amazing products and they
[28:59] find slowly but surely they start
[29:01] running up against a fiat incentive
[29:04] structure working against them of
[29:05] quarterly returns of making sure your
[29:07] KPIs are hit of whatever the goal is
[29:10] instead of the the truly overarching
[29:13] goal of like, hey, we're going to make
[29:14] Bitcoin better. We're going to make it
[29:15] more secure. or we're going to make it
[29:16] more accessible. And they find that that
[29:18] drifts so far that eventually they get
[29:20] pushed out of the company. Uh, and it's
[29:23] been really interesting because that's
[29:24] been sort of one of our philosophical
[29:26] slants here is that like
[29:29] Vora is first and foremost a
[29:31] philosophical company and like we're
[29:32] committed to solving what we've been
[29:35] calling the Honeybadger's dilemma. Like
[29:37] do we have to make this choice between a
[29:39] 6102 attack or a wrench attack? like do
[29:42] I need to give my keys to a custodian
[29:44] that they could have to comply with
[29:46] giving that money to the government or
[29:48] do I hold my keys in a self-s sovereign
[29:50] way where if someone is directly
[29:52] threatening me like I have to give up my
[29:54] Bitcoin and at first we're like we think
[29:57] that this is solvable uh like it
[30:00] shouldn't be too hard and as we've sort
[30:02] of got in the weeds of it we're like
[30:03] whoa this is actually like a really hard
[30:04] problem to solve and there's a lot of
[30:06] tertiary stuff and so we've committed a
[30:09] lot of time and energy into R&D to like
[30:10] make some uh I think pretty powerful
[30:14] innovations sort of in the space but
[30:16] also like uh it's deeply alarming to me
[30:19] that like right now the best that we can
[30:21] do with collaborative custodies means
[30:23] that you are going to be doxing your
[30:25] UTXOs and like that's deeply alarming
[30:28] and the other thing is like we have the
[30:30] technology to make that different. So,
[30:32] one of the things that we really want to
[30:34] do with Vora in our product is like
[30:35] we're going to be shipping with a full
[30:36] node from the get-go. And the reason is
[30:39] is so that you can do silent payments so
[30:41] that when somebody does actually get
[30:43] paid, we don't we don't know that. And
[30:46] there's a number of advancements that
[30:47] Jesse has made on the cryptographic
[30:49] front using uh zero knowledge proofs and
[30:51] other things that ensure that like we
[30:52] can preserve your privacy because to us
[30:54] like that's a number one goal is like
[30:58] you deserve to have your privacy and not
[31:01] have us be a direct threat vector to you
[31:04] and like that that is a complete
[31:06] non-negotiable for us. So like if it
[31:09] turns out we have to refactor everything
[31:10] in order to preserve that, that's what
[31:13] we'll have to do. And that's why we're a
[31:15] philosophical company is like we aren't
[31:18] first and foremost about profits, but
[31:20] we're about making sure that we actually
[31:22] meet the goals. And that's going to be a
[31:24] very very large bar to handle. But the
[31:27] great thing is is that it turns out by
[31:30] pushing value all the way up the
[31:32] philosophical chain to be like we're
[31:33] going to make this the most valuable
[31:35] thing that actually transforms into our
[31:38] opinion becoming what will be one of the
[31:40] most valuable companies in the world
[31:41] because people need to have self-
[31:43] sovereignty with their data particularly
[31:45] in the world that we're moving into
[31:47] where AI is becoming so powerful and
[31:49] sophisticated and like you're going to
[31:51] want to own your own data and have it be
[31:54] cryptographically secured in the same
[31:56] way that your Bitcoin will be in the
[31:57] future because if you don't, it means
[31:59] that somebody else is going to be
[32:00] owning, running, and essentially
[32:02] controlling how you're going to
[32:04] interface with the internet.
[32:05] How do you how do you balance the uh the
[32:08] you know obviously what is a strong
[32:10] ethos for you guys and driving force
[32:13] this desire to want people to have full
[32:16] control over their own privacy to not
[32:17] want you guys to be a security hole to
[32:20] how do you balance that with then also
[32:22] wanting to take care or provide
[32:24] protection quote uh to other aspects of
[32:28] people's lives like their physical
[32:30] security like there there have to be
[32:32] some trade-offs there right to be able
[32:34] to actually prov provide the one but
[32:36] then respect the other. Yeah,
[32:38] absolutely. It's it's a devilishly
[32:41] difficult problem to solve. Um the
[32:45] transaction pro privacy is more
[32:47] straightforward um than the than the
[32:50] physical security. You know the the big
[32:53] problem with collaborative custody is
[32:55] that a c you know one of these
[32:57] collaborative custodians they have a key
[33:00] and they can use that key uh to find all
[33:04] the transactions on the blockchain and
[33:06] that can be solved with cryptography
[33:08] with some techniques called chain code
[33:11] delegation that we've developed um blind
[33:13] signatures and zero knowledge proofs and
[33:16] the zero knowledge proofs let us enforce
[33:19] let the server enforce
[33:21] um policies that protect the customer
[33:23] like spending limits or time delays um
[33:27] without needing to learn the transaction
[33:30] details, the balances of our customers.
[33:32] And so that's how we're able to strike
[33:35] the balance in terms of transaction
[33:36] privacy is we can use these zero
[33:38] knowledge proofs where the server can
[33:39] enforce whatever policy it needs without
[33:42] learning anything else. But in terms of
[33:44] our alarm systems, that's where there
[33:47] needs to be location data that goes to
[33:50] law enforcement or private security or
[33:53] both to be able to respond to an attack.
[33:56] And so we're using some technologies
[33:58] there where we can actually build an
[34:00] alarm system that routes this data
[34:03] without our company learning the
[34:05] physical home address which sounds
[34:07] impossible at first but one of the
[34:09] technologies we're using there is
[34:11] something called a trusted execution
[34:13] environment. And so certain chips like
[34:16] in some Intel chips, AMD chips, they
[34:19] have this um feature built into the
[34:22] hardware of the chip where there's a
[34:24] secure enclave where that the data in
[34:28] the enclave doesn't leave that part of
[34:31] the chip and it can generate a public
[34:35] key that it can export and you can
[34:39] encrypt data to that public key such
[34:41] that only the data can only be decrypted
[34:45] within the trusted execution environment
[34:47] and the private key doesn't leave the
[34:49] trusted execution environment. And on
[34:52] top of that, these chips have a feature
[34:54] called remote attestation
[34:56] where the trusted execution environment
[34:59] can provide a hash that tells you what
[35:02] code is running inside of the trusted
[35:05] execution environment and that hash is
[35:08] bound to the public key. So if you want
[35:11] to give private data to a server but you
[35:15] only want to give that private data to
[35:17] the server if you know that exactly how
[35:20] the private data is going to be executed
[35:22] in code. The chip gives you this
[35:25] attestation document with a key where
[35:28] you can have high assurance that if I
[35:30] encrypt data to this key the only code
[35:33] that can operate on that data is what
[35:36] matches the hash in the attestation
[35:38] document. And so what we're able to do
[35:41] is we in the the Vora vault which is
[35:45] what we call the the hardware wallet
[35:48] plus node that's could be in the form of
[35:50] a server rack that lives in your in your
[35:52] home. It's going to get this attestation
[35:56] document from our server, encrypt the
[35:58] location data to the trusted execution
[36:02] environment and now the location data
[36:04] only lives in that environment and we
[36:07] ourselves as Vora cannot access that
[36:10] data. We have no way of going inside
[36:12] that chip and pulling out the private
[36:14] data. when we need to route it to
[36:18] emergency services,
[36:20] they will call our server using TLS, an
[36:24] encrypted connection that terminates in
[36:27] the trusted execution environment. So an
[36:29] encrypted connections made between an
[36:32] emergency services API and our trusted
[36:35] execution environment.
[36:38] that trusted ex that T trusted execution
[36:41] environment. The T hands off the
[36:43] location data through the encrypted
[36:45] connection to the emergency services
[36:48] API.
[36:49] So the people who need to respond get
[36:52] that location data. In the process, our
[36:56] company has no ability to see it at all
[36:59] and we can't decrypt it. E if we're
[37:02] forced to do something by the government
[37:04] or somebody else, we literally have no
[37:06] ability to get to that data.
[37:09] One trust vector there is you have to
[37:12] trust the chip itself that this trusted
[37:15] execution environment was actually
[37:16] implemented correctly. So if Intel let's
[37:19] say is completely backdoored, there
[37:22] could be a vulnerability there. None has
[37:25] been discovered. But one way we can
[37:27] diversify that risk is to use multiple
[37:30] chips from multiple vendors and shard
[37:33] the secret across all the chips. So even
[37:36] if one of them is compromised,
[37:38] all of them would need to be
[37:39] compromised. So we can have both an
[37:41] Intel and an AMD chip and in the future
[37:44] also an ARM chip where all three of them
[37:47] would have to be compromised for this
[37:49] data to be compromised. In addition,
[37:51] there could be an attack where if you
[37:53] have physical access to the chip in the
[37:55] data center, there could be certain
[37:58] attacks that might be able to compromise
[37:59] these environments. So, we can actually
[38:02] further diversify the risk by using all
[38:05] three cloud vendors, AWS, Google, um,
[38:09] and Microsoft clouds and eventually our
[38:13] own data center that we stand up. So now
[38:17] you have to compromise three different
[38:19] types of chips across four different
[38:22] types of cloud vendors.
[38:25] And at that point the practicality of
[38:28] that is very low. The cost of the attack
[38:31] is so immense that it outweighs whatever
[38:34] kind of monetary value could be
[38:36] extracted from this data. And as these
[38:39] technologies develop over time and and
[38:42] as the size of our company grows over
[38:44] time, we'll be able to make our own
[38:45] open- source chips that are have even
[38:47] higher degrees of verifiability.
[38:50] But this is going to provide a very high
[38:52] assurance that we can have this
[38:54] encrypted location data that we can give
[38:56] to emergency services without our
[38:59] company ever learning the actual home
[39:02] address in the process. So you guys have
[39:05] thought about this like just a little
[39:07] bit then, right? just a little bit.
[39:09] Yeah. No, that's that I mean that's
[39:12] that's awesome. Uh I mean you're you are
[39:16] basically trying to decentralize any
[39:17] potential single points of failure and
[39:20] create something that is Yeah. Okay.
[39:22] Something maybe could be breached here,
[39:25] but you're not going to breach all
[39:27] aspects of it just because it's not not
[39:29] economically feasible to do so. like
[39:31] doing so would require uh like ungodly
[39:35] amounts of both either money or time or
[39:38] collusion or whatever. So it's it's like
[39:41] can you ever make risk zero? No. But
[39:43] you're taking it as close as you can to
[39:46] that uh with this strategy it seems.
[39:49] Absolutely. And the the equation I think
[39:53] about all the time is cost of attack
[39:56] versus reward times probability of
[39:59] success.
[40:01] If the cost of attack is greater than
[40:03] the other side of the equation, then it
[40:06] is economically irrational to mount the
[40:09] attack. And so we do everything
[40:11] possible. You know, you cannot defeat an
[40:14] attacker with infinite resources. But
[40:17] fortunately, those aren't the attackers
[40:19] we're facing. And so we do everything
[40:22] possible to drive up that cost of attack
[40:26] such that there are easier targets,
[40:28] softer targets, and that any kind of
[40:31] attacker that tries to mount that attack
[40:33] is essentially going to bankrupt
[40:34] themselves.
[40:37] I think that's really fascinating. This
[40:39] this is a total sidebar and I don't mean
[40:41] to digress, but have you noticed that so
[40:43] many of these recent uh physical attacks
[40:46] uh if we're talking physical attacks on
[40:48] Bitcoiners or crypto people have been in
[40:51] France like Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like
[40:54] they don't have a right to protect
[40:56] themselves or something. It's it's
[40:57] almost like the rule the rule of law has
[40:59] like broken down or something and it's
[41:02] not really a functioning society
[41:03] anymore.
[41:05] Am I off base there? I don't know. That
[41:07] sounds like conspiracy theory stuff.
[41:08] Probably just a coincidence. Probably
[41:10] just like it's important to also
[41:11] understand like you know back in January
[41:13] there was that influencer who you know
[41:16] was being very thoughtless about how she
[41:18] was presenting her crypto holdings. Uh
[41:21] but with that being said because her
[41:23] partner was armed uh like these
[41:26] criminals found very real violence that
[41:28] met them. And
[41:30] uh while it's definitely not an outcome
[41:33] that is desirable, it's like if people
[41:36] come and threaten you with violence,
[41:38] like I I don't see any problem
[41:40] whatsoever about meeting them right
[41:42] there and asserting your right to
[41:45] protect yourself, particularly within
[41:46] things like the castle doctrine. And so
[41:49] another part of Vora is like we're we
[41:51] believe that it's time to take on the
[41:53] home security market seriously. like ADT
[41:55] is a huge multi-billion dollar company
[41:58] and the truth is is that what they offer
[42:00] pales in comparison about the
[42:01] opportunities that are available and
[42:03] particularly the technological
[42:04] development. So, one is is just being
[42:07] able to have your own home self-s
[42:09] surveillance systems that self- encrypt
[42:11] onto our own data server using the same
[42:13] T methodology and has methods to not
[42:16] only share that data with law
[42:17] enforcement or private security, but
[42:20] like it's important that like you
[42:21] control that data too cuz uh
[42:24] surprisingly a lot of people they put up
[42:26] Ring cameras and don't understand that
[42:28] like if you live in somewhere like Iowa
[42:31] and smoke weed on your porch that like
[42:33] yes, that can actually be used to
[42:35] incriminate you because you don't own
[42:37] that data. Amazon owns it. So, this is
[42:40] just one step in the other direction.
[42:42] And funny enough, something that started
[42:43] out as kind of a joke that we're
[42:45] actually now exploring is uh actually
[42:48] drone surveillance systems. Is that like
[42:49] we have finally gotten to the place that
[42:51] automated drone surveillance is
[42:53] something that is actually feasible at
[42:55] this point in time. And so using that
[42:57] same methodology, there's very powerful
[43:00] tactics that if someone were to trigger
[43:02] a panic button or if there was to be a
[43:04] notification that could trigger these
[43:06] things that you could actually have a
[43:09] drone or a swarm of drones that could
[43:11] then respond to where your location is
[43:14] and to provide surveillance to the
[43:16] responding law enforcement or private
[43:18] security. And this is really about uh
[43:22] it's time that Bitcoiners really make a
[43:24] choice to upgrade themselves and start
[43:27] providing their own uh surveillance and
[43:30] security for themselves. And uh it's
[43:32] time for us to to really upgrade
[43:34] security on a whole cuz this is moving
[43:36] into a more scary direction. But also
[43:39] like we can't be truly self-s sovereign
[43:42] if we find that when these instances
[43:44] come up, we're always turning to the
[43:46] state and asking for them to assist us.
[43:49] Uh, and so we hope as the company
[43:52] becomes larger and expands that, you
[43:54] know, like we will really be able to
[43:55] sort of own that aspect of security as
[43:58] well. And that's really important cuz uh
[44:01] I've definitely had instances where I've
[44:03] had to deal with law enforcement like
[44:04] here in the city when my car was stolen
[44:06] on multiple occasions because it's San
[44:08] Francisco. Uh, and it was pretty sad and
[44:10] unfortunate to see not only how poorly
[44:12] that turned out, but how much in that
[44:14] process I was victimized by the police
[44:16] department because like there isn't
[44:18] necessarily an incentive to help you
[44:20] out. So these are all things that we've
[44:22] thought very seriously about and we're
[44:24] taking
[44:25] what we really want Vora to be the next
[44:28] generation of hyper bitcoinized
[44:29] companies cuz others is that the entire
[44:31] model of our company is like bitcoin
[44:34] will be at a million and then 10 million
[44:36] and then $21 million per coin and that
[44:39] is going to escalate not only the cost
[44:41] of attack but also the very structure of
[44:43] how security itself is going to be dealt
[44:45] with and we want to be at the forefront
[44:47] of making sure that that is done in a
[44:50] thoughtful and robust way and that we're
[44:53] not still panicking and sort of
[44:54] following up behind on the price.
[44:58] You know, I I got to say I love that you
[45:00] guys are tackling both sides of this,
[45:03] right? Because there are obviously
[45:06] companies who do, you know, uh just, you
[45:08] know, multi-IG or, you know, a
[45:10] collaborative, you know, multi-IG
[45:11] custody. Uh I I use one of those
[45:14] companies with a bunch of different
[45:16] seeds. Uh, and like I'm pleased with
[45:19] that company. It has allowed me to sleep
[45:20] better at night and I know that nobody
[45:22] can come into my house and force me to
[45:25] give up any Bitcoin. By the same token,
[45:28] most people that will try to come into
[45:30] my house and do that are [ __ ] stupid.
[45:32] And they and if I tell them, "Oh, well,
[45:34] I'm sorry, sir. I have a multi-IG. You
[45:36] won't be getting any corn from me."
[45:38] They'll be like, "Well, okay, then I'll
[45:40] I'll cut off your finger and then I'll
[45:41] cut off your wife's finger." And like
[45:45] you trying to explain your, you know,
[45:47] geographically distributed multi-IG to
[45:50] somebody who's coming into your house
[45:52] trying to like expecting to come in and
[45:54] do violence against you, that's just not
[45:56] going to work out well for you, like at
[45:58] all. And so if you're not handling the
[46:00] physical side of the security, it's like
[46:02] well then like honestly like yeah, it's
[46:05] cool that you have this neat little
[46:06] solution, but like why bother? I mean,
[46:09] yeah, you should still bother. Like
[46:10] multisig is great, but like you you're
[46:12] just you're only solving for 50% of the
[46:15] problem and the other 50% will literally
[46:17] get you killed. Like the multisig part
[46:20] stops you from, you know, okay, losing
[46:22] your [ __ ] coins in a stupid way. But
[46:24] if you're not protecting your physical
[46:26] security, if you don't have plans in
[46:28] place for that, like then what? Like the
[46:31] option is not you lose your coins. The
[46:32] option is you die. And like that's like
[46:35] no amount of Bitcoin is worth my life or
[46:37] my family's life. And so like that's
[46:39] like then how do I protect against that?
[46:41] And so I think it's like I'd love to
[46:43] dive into that a little bit deeper with
[46:44] you guys because like this is something
[46:47] obviously in America we have guns. Thank
[46:49] God for that. Like that's that's
[46:51] fantastic. I myself am a large enjoyer
[46:54] of guns and have been using them since I
[46:56] was a small child cuz I'm from Bumble
[46:58] [ __ ] Wisconsin. And that's how you grow
[47:00] up. Um but like a lot of places in the
[47:04] world do not have the like only the
[47:06] state has guns. That's a terrifying
[47:08] prospect because then you are completely
[47:11] reliant on the state. So I'm curious,
[47:13] are you guys targeting like
[47:16] are there different sorts of threat
[47:18] models that you're looking at for like
[47:19] US-based customers who do have the
[47:21] ability and right to defend themselves
[47:23] versus international customers? Are you
[47:26] targeting one audience first? How how
[47:28] are you guys going about that?
[47:30] Yeah. Well, I think we in the US, we
[47:34] have some of the strongest legal cover,
[47:37] you know, not just for the kinds of
[47:39] self-defense systems we want to build,
[47:41] but also just for self-custody in
[47:42] general. We have a bill of rights. We
[47:45] have the rights remain silent. That's
[47:47] actually something that helps us with
[47:49] 6102 attacks because there's certain
[47:51] recovery methods that are going to
[47:53] require a PIN. And we have we can use
[47:56] something called an OPRF where you can
[47:58] derive a strong key from a short pin.
[48:02] And you know unlike 12 words or 24 words
[48:05] like uh four digits or six digits is
[48:08] something that somebody has a shot of
[48:10] actually being able to memorize. not
[48:12] required in all cases, but if you think
[48:15] you need to establish your
[48:16] constitutional rights, um you can move
[48:20] your coin to something where um
[48:22] testimonial
[48:24] a testimonial factor is required. And
[48:27] under the fifth amendment, due process,
[48:29] rights remain silent. Um you can't be
[48:32] forced to divulge um a memorized PIN or
[48:36] password. And so that's the kind of
[48:38] protection that we're going to most
[48:40] strongly be able to establish in the
[48:42] United States um and in other countries
[48:45] that acknowledge that kind of right but
[48:47] won't be available everywhere. But in
[48:51] terms of wrench attacks specifically,
[48:53] um the initial defense that we're
[48:56] looking at um will work wherever we can
[48:59] um have emergency services connect to an
[49:03] API over TLS because what happens is we
[49:06] have this vault at home that's a node
[49:08] that is running online all the time that
[49:11] has backup network connections and if
[49:15] the node goes down we can detect that
[49:18] and so that will cause our monitoring
[49:21] team to um make a phone call to the
[49:24] customer and to check for a verbal
[49:26] password. And if we don't get the right
[49:29] password or if we don't get a the person
[49:32] to answer their phone, that triggers
[49:35] this emergency response. And that's
[49:38] something we'll be able to deploy widely
[49:40] to a lot of different places. And we'll
[49:42] have other triggers um like if you enter
[49:45] the wrong PIN or if we detect other
[49:48] sorts of anomalies. And this also
[49:50] applies to the mobile app by the way
[49:53] where if you're out on the go and you're
[49:54] using the mobile app and we're going to
[49:56] have a hot wallet that you can use on
[49:58] the mobile app, the bulk of your funds
[49:59] will never be able to move uh you know
[50:02] with a phone only. But if you're for
[50:04] forced to open that app and you put the
[50:06] wrong PIN, we can send um your GPS
[50:09] coordinates using this same trusted
[50:11] execution environment system. Um if if
[50:15] and and we can check by calling the
[50:17] customer to make sure there isn't uh
[50:20] like a false alarm or something like
[50:22] that. And you know when you check for
[50:24] verbal password uh to an attacker, they
[50:27] have no way of knowing whether you gave
[50:28] the real verbal password or the wrong
[50:30] verbal password. And so this gives us a
[50:33] really strong mechanism where you don't
[50:35] have to actively hit a panic button just
[50:38] in the course of being attacked. We can
[50:40] get notified and we can respond and we
[50:42] can find out. That's where we're
[50:44] starting. That's that's kind of the MVP,
[50:47] but that's not where we're ending. You
[50:49] know, we're going to keep escalating
[50:51] from there. And we expect home security
[50:54] and personal security is going to
[50:56] evolve, with drone technology, with
[50:59] robotics, with AI, with all of these
[51:03] things. We're going to go beyond just
[51:05] people having a gun. And you know, even
[51:07] with a gun, you can get caught by
[51:09] surprise. You can get outnumbered. And
[51:11] so we can create a greater asymmetry
[51:14] between defense and offense by staying
[51:17] on the cutting edge of the technology
[51:19] curve that's accelerate accelerating
[51:21] very quickly. And so we'll have to see
[51:24] the legality of those systems in
[51:25] different jurisdictions to the extent
[51:27] we'll be able to roll them out. But
[51:30] we're going to move very aggressively
[51:31] and and also we're going to engage in
[51:33] political lobbying. We're going to
[51:35] engage in with politicians to make the
[51:38] case that you need these protections for
[51:41] your citizens. This is about safety.
[51:44] This is about the fundamental principle
[51:46] of the law that's been there for as long
[51:48] as there's law that Eric talked about
[51:50] with the castle doctrine. People have a
[51:53] right to self-defense. If somebody comes
[51:55] to your home with a gun and an intent to
[51:57] harm, there's no reason that that person
[52:00] should um be protected from the kind of
[52:04] response that we need to mount. And
[52:07] ultimately, the the best form of
[52:09] protection we want is credible
[52:11] deterrence because once we establish
[52:14] credible deterrence, criminals aren't
[52:15] going to attack us at all. Right now,
[52:18] organized crime sees the Bitcoin
[52:20] community as a soft target, as an easy
[52:23] target, as lowhanging fruit. We're going
[52:26] to change that. We're going to make them
[52:28] know and realize that the Bitcoin
[52:30] community is the hardest target in the
[52:33] world, that they have much easier
[52:36] targets to go after. And if they come
[52:39] after our customers, they will be
[52:41] caught. They will be punished or worse.
[52:44] And they should not [ __ ] with us.
[52:48] I I [ __ ] let me just say I [ __ ]
[52:50] love that because one thing that I
[52:51] always found absurd is that like you
[52:53] have these high-profile like Bitcoin or
[52:55] crypto people who get targeted, but it's
[52:58] like it blows my mind that those people
[53:01] are targeted when you have like very
[53:04] publicly super rich uh let's say fiat
[53:06] celebrities flaunting their wealth all
[53:08] over, you know, Instagram and
[53:10] everywhere. But it's like what's the
[53:12] difference? Well, with those very rich
[53:14] celebrities, there's no guarantee that
[53:16] they're going to be able to instantly
[53:17] transfer you millions of dollars if you
[53:19] cut off a finger. Like, that that's
[53:21] basically the that's the difference is,
[53:23] you know, that it's going to be harder
[53:24] to get their money out because it's in
[53:26] the fiat system. Their money is in
[53:28] banks. Their money like it's it's not so
[53:30] easy to just like, yeah, okay, let me
[53:32] sign a transaction and broadcast this
[53:35] 100%.
[53:36] So we we have to change that equation
[53:39] where yeah, we have irreversible
[53:41] anonymous money and that has a lot of
[53:44] attractive properties to an attacker,
[53:47] but not if they know with certainty that
[53:49] first of all, everything's time locked.
[53:51] They're not going to get the Bitcoin.
[53:53] And second of all, they're going to get
[53:54] caught. They're going to get punished.
[53:56] We're going to track them down. We're
[53:58] going to put bounties to get information
[54:01] to catch these people. We have a heads
[54:03] on pikes principle which is that we're
[54:05] going to publicize when we catch these
[54:08] people and we're going to make everybody
[54:10] know that they got caught, they got
[54:12] punished. And it's just going to be very
[54:15] clear that, you know, when when somebody
[54:17] sees the Vora logo, if they're a
[54:19] criminal, they're going to run away
[54:22] screaming in fear because they know that
[54:25] this is not going to end well for them.
[54:27] Yeah. And it it's and like first I I
[54:30] want to clarify like owning owning your
[54:31] safety is something that like only you
[54:33] can do you know it's the same way it's
[54:35] like if you're going to drive a car like
[54:37] you should buckle your seat belt like if
[54:39] you don't buckle your seat belt it
[54:40] doesn't really matter what happens when
[54:42] you get in a car crash it's going to be
[54:43] bad. So the same thing like I'm always
[54:45] pretty pedantic about this with people
[54:47] of that like even if you don't like
[54:49] guns, even if you don't own guns, like
[54:51] if you are an American, you should
[54:53] probably take a firearm handling course
[54:55] so that you know and understand how a
[54:56] weapon is cuz what do you do in a
[54:58] situation if there is a loaded gun? Like
[55:00] can you unload it? Like do you feel
[55:02] comfortable with doing that? Would you
[55:04] be safe with doing that or do you need
[55:06] to ask somebody else to do your safety?
[55:08] So like it's very important to own that
[55:10] safety. But on the next level, it's like
[55:13] uh we want to essentially have the
[55:15] world's best investigative and response
[55:18] team that happens so that when people
[55:19] see that Vora logo, they go, you know,
[55:21] let's go [ __ ] with somebody else. Like
[55:23] that this isn't going to work out if
[55:24] that cuz right now there's a real
[55:27] opportunity because of the sort of
[55:28] failed socialism that has created the
[55:30] legal portion of the state that like you
[55:32] can perform crimes and get away with it
[55:34] because of how the system functions. We
[55:37] want to let people know that like if
[55:39] you're going to be [ __ ] with Vora
[55:40] customers, like not only will all that
[55:42] information be very actively given to
[55:44] law enforcement, but there will be
[55:46] specialized individuals that have dealt
[55:48] with this throughout their lives who
[55:49] will be responding to it and doing the
[55:52] full investigation and making sure that
[55:54] you are caught. And I think one of the
[55:56] more interesting ones is I'm pretty sure
[55:58] any of these crypto influencers if you
[56:01] got in that moment with them where uh
[56:03] like it's becoming clear that there is
[56:05] an active robbery going on against them,
[56:07] they would be more than happy to mount
[56:09] up 10% of the total amount of whatever
[56:12] Bitcoin or crypto that they own to pay
[56:14] for people to respond and help them. we
[56:16] actually have these abilities and
[56:18] capacities and we would like to develop
[56:20] in that direction because there's no
[56:22] reason that if I'm being robbed at
[56:24] gunpoint that I shouldn't be able to
[56:27] have other individuals that are within
[56:29] the area who could respond to me be able
[56:31] to show up and offer assistance. So, uh,
[56:33] we're very early on, but we feel
[56:35] confident that that this is actually a
[56:37] solvable problem. And not only is it
[56:39] solvable, like this is the most
[56:41] important issue to become solvable for
[56:43] Bitcoiners. And we want to lead the
[56:45] charge on that by making a Bitcoin first
[56:48] hyper Bitcoin company that understands
[56:51] there will actually be a point in time
[56:53] somewhere where because of how the state
[56:55] is failing and collapsing that getting
[56:58] law enforcement to respond in a
[56:59] meaningful way probably won't be very
[57:01] available. And so we're going to need to
[57:03] have alternative solutions and we're
[57:06] only going to have those solutions in
[57:07] place by looking out into a future that
[57:09] knows and understands that's what's
[57:11] coming down the line. A and by the way,
[57:14] you know, insurance doesn't solve this
[57:16] problem because even if your Bitcoin is
[57:19] insured, if an attacker knows your
[57:22] Bitcoin is insured, you're a great
[57:23] target for them because they know you're
[57:25] going to give it up easily. And what
[57:28] now? You're their ATM. like what makes
[57:31] them stop? You know, they they get it
[57:33] from you. You get your insurance, you
[57:35] get your Bitcoin back. Well, now they're
[57:37] going to come back for more and they're
[57:39] going to come back again and again and
[57:41] again. So, insurance is great, but
[57:43] insurance by itself does not solve the
[57:45] wrench attack problem. You know, it's
[57:48] it's a really good point. One thing I
[57:50] want to ask you guys about if maybe uh
[57:53] part one would be uh could either of you
[57:55] just like elaborate on the castle
[57:57] doctrine for folks that maybe are not
[57:58] familiar with this. But then the second
[58:00] part would be just a larger question
[58:01] which is I think in the in recent years
[58:04] we've seen sort of a uh a lot of
[58:08] Bitcoiners say you know okay America is
[58:10] not the place you should be living. If
[58:11] you're a Bitcoiner you shouldn't live in
[58:12] America. You know you should live in
[58:14] whether it be Dubai or you know uh El El
[58:17] Salvador. Nothing against those places.
[58:18] I've never been to Dubai. I like El
[58:20] Salvador a lot. It's amazing what
[58:22] they've done. But like this kind of like
[58:25] almost like anti-American sentiment uh
[58:28] in terms of like nah this isn't a good
[58:30] place for Bitcoiners.
[58:32] I disagree with that fundamentally
[58:35] because I think that America again the
[58:37] fact that you can be armed to the
[58:40] [ __ ] teeth in America actually makes
[58:43] a huge difference and the fact that we
[58:46] do have certain laws in place that allow
[58:47] you to protect yourself and meet
[58:50] violence with violence in the form of
[58:51] self-defense is really really meaningful
[58:55] and do you see I mean
[58:58] with a like is is any part of your
[59:01] thesis kind around like, okay, there's
[59:03] actually going to be a shift towards
[59:04] like Bitcoiners are going to bring
[59:06] their, you know, physical bodies, but
[59:08] also their capital and cyerspace back to
[59:10] America because of these protections
[59:13] that do exist for Americans because you
[59:15] can take your safety into your own
[59:16] hands. Is that something you guys are
[59:18] kind of like theorizing a little bit?
[59:19] Because that's the vibe I'm getting.
[59:21] 100%. And this is actually sort of one
[59:24] of the more uh distant goals and what
[59:26] Jesse alluded to earlier about doing uh
[59:30] some work within the political sphere is
[59:32] that uh we feel very strongly that uh
[59:35] like America is really the only place
[59:37] that Bitcoin has a true chance of
[59:38] success and it's because of the powerful
[59:42] constitutional protections that we have
[59:44] and the ability of the sovereignty of
[59:47] individual states to counteract a rogue
[59:50] federal government and using those
[59:51] powers to balance balance against one
[59:53] another. We feel like there's a very
[59:54] very powerful apparatus to be able to
[59:57] resist state overreach. Uh and
[59:59] furthermore, the United States is one of
[60:01] the only places that you actually are
[60:03] entitled to the castle doctrine, which
[60:05] means that if someone is coming into
[60:07] your home intent on violence and wanting
[60:10] to rob you or cause harm against you or
[60:12] your property, you do have a right to
[60:15] engage in deadly force against those
[60:18] individuals. And we believe that this is
[60:20] going to become a very key and critical
[60:23] aspect of being able to provide the
[60:25] self-s sovereignty. And one of the
[60:28] things that we stand next to with Vora
[60:30] is that like let's say that somebody has
[60:32] a Vora safe and somebody does come to
[60:34] their home to rob them
[60:36] when they engage in using deadly force
[60:39] against them. Like we will have their
[60:41] back 100%. We will pay for their
[60:43] lawyers. We will take on the entire cost
[60:45] of making sure that we push that
[60:47] forward. Because to us, this is a really
[60:49] important public demonstration of that
[60:51] like you own a Vora vault. Our job is to
[60:54] help protect and secure you. Like we do
[60:56] not end just at the keys, but this is
[60:58] actually about you as a Bitcoiner. And
[61:01] this is about us creating a human
[61:04] ccentric Bitcoin company that knows and
[61:07] understands the reason that you own
[61:09] Bitcoin is because of the self-
[61:10] sovereignty that that gives you. And
[61:12] that's what we're in service towards.
[61:14] Like our job doesn't just end at the
[61:16] keys. It ends when we know that you're
[61:18] safe and can provide that. And that's
[61:20] the same reason why we'll provide
[61:21] investigative teams and the same reason
[61:23] why we will provide rapid response teams
[61:25] is that while these are going to be very
[61:28] expensive and difficult problems to
[61:29] solve, they must be solved if we are
[61:33] actually to be able to say that we are
[61:34] people that are self-s sovereign. Yeah.
[61:36] And and as hyper Bitcoinization happens,
[61:39] we're going to have access to
[61:41] substantial resources to deploy against
[61:44] these problems. And you know before I
[61:47] became an engineer and a cryptographer I
[61:50] was a lawyer. I I practiced law for 10
[61:52] years. Um I was in then became inspired
[61:55] by Bitcoin and the cipher punk vision
[61:57] and the idea that code is law. But I
[62:00] have those roots in my legal training
[62:02] and Vora has a legal and political
[62:05] strategy. And how we see it is yes, you
[62:09] know, America in many ways has has
[62:12] strayed from the founding principles.
[62:15] The Constitution's been eroded. We we
[62:18] have these problems that Eric's
[62:19] highlighted in in his writings about
[62:22] permanent states of emergency
[62:24] suspensions of the normal legal order.
[62:26] We've seen with Snowden and you know
[62:28] countless examples of how the principles
[62:31] of this country are not as intact as we
[62:34] would like them to be but those are our
[62:37] roots and those are we do have the
[62:40] constitution and we do have the vision
[62:43] and philosophy of the founding fathers
[62:45] and what influenced them John Lockach
[62:48] and Rouso and the fundamental principles
[62:51] of liberty and freedom and natural
[62:54] rights and natural law. This is the
[62:57] foundation of this country and that's
[62:59] never going to go away. And so that's
[63:01] something very powerful that we can tap
[63:04] into and that we can make the case that
[63:07] self-s sovereignty in Bitcoin is an
[63:09] extension of the American political
[63:12] tradition. It is in line with what the
[63:15] founding fathers fought for the same
[63:18] sort of principles. I have no doubt that
[63:21] if they were alive today, they would be
[63:23] Bitcoiners. And so we are continuing
[63:26] that tradition and we can take that to
[63:28] the courts. We can take that to the
[63:30] Supreme Court and we can make that case
[63:33] that what we're doing here is in line
[63:36] with the fundamental legal political
[63:38] principles of the Constitution and we
[63:41] can fight and win those battles. And
[63:43] we've seen with the NRA their ability to
[63:46] succeed that way, whether it's through
[63:48] lobbying and and creating uh a political
[63:52] situation where gun rights cannot be
[63:54] eroded or winning in the courts and
[63:57] protecting those rights. And so that's
[64:00] the same model we're going to be using
[64:02] with Vora is that we're going to be
[64:04] establishing in the law and in the
[64:07] political system that se self-s
[64:09] sovereignty is a sacrosan
[64:12] political constitutional
[64:14] principle that cannot be violated under
[64:17] any circumstances.
[64:19] What does that what does that look like?
[64:22] I mean, and you know, case, I'm curious,
[64:24] too. Does this dovetail in with uh your
[64:27] VP bid alongside American uh huddle for
[64:31] the presidential run? Is is that is it
[64:33] is the plan all coming together now?
[64:36] Apparently. So, so like we'll need to
[64:38] have some great legal conflict where
[64:40] we're obviously uh thrown away and I'll
[64:43] just at that point that's when I have to
[64:44] be like we clearly have to overthrow the
[64:47] political establishment. Um, but with
[64:49] that being said, like I've been shocked
[64:51] at the amount of tertiary curiosity
[64:54] that's sort of gone on with the Orange
[64:56] Party and uh I literally have not
[64:58] talking spoke to anybody nor me or
[65:00] otherwise who I haven't been like look
[65:02] like both parties are absolutely corrupt
[65:05] beyond repair at this point and so like
[65:07] do you agree with that? And you know,
[65:10] like I'll get him and Han, but they'll
[65:12] be like, "Yeah, like both are extremely
[65:14] problematic." And like it's I really do
[65:17] hope that we'll actually get a sincere
[65:19] and realistic Orange Party movement that
[65:21] is committed to the radical principles.
[65:24] And I'm very pedantic about this. Like
[65:25] I'm not talking about a traditional
[65:28] standard political party. But I'm
[65:30] essentially talking about a rogue
[65:33] syndicist methodology of having people
[65:36] be like, "I'm part of the Orange Party.
[65:38] This is about the education and allowing
[65:41] for individuals to hold and use Bitcoin
[65:44] as self-s sovereign individuals to
[65:46] influence state level politics and
[65:49] really to get people on board with
[65:50] understanding that like if you identify
[65:52] with red or blue, like you're the enemy.
[65:54] like you're the person that has allowed
[65:56] for our country to be destroyed. You're
[65:58] the one that is standing aside and
[66:00] saying that either one of these people
[66:03] who are stealing and destroying the
[66:06] goodness that our country has that like
[66:08] you're on their side and because you
[66:10] identify that way, you're my enemy. I
[66:12] don't want that. But it's very clear
[66:14] that if your guy gets into power, you're
[66:16] okay with them stealing from me. you're
[66:18] okay with them taking my money and using
[66:20] that to make war against people who I've
[66:22] never met and I don't have conflict
[66:23] with. And I think that's a despicable
[66:26] and horrible thing. And I don't know, I
[66:29] I always find it really interesting that
[66:30] when you come back to the thing of like
[66:32] both parties want to use your money to
[66:34] murder other people and like you're okay
[66:36] with that. No one's ever like, "Yeah,
[66:38] I'm okay with it." Most people object to
[66:40] it, but it's like that's that's a very
[66:42] real truth. And I apologize that it
[66:45] might make you feel uncomfortable and it
[66:47] might be difficult to look at, but it is
[66:49] true, you know, and like Obama who is
[66:52] largely celebrated as being uh this
[66:54] liberal ideal, it's really important to
[66:56] understand that like as a constitutional
[66:58] lawyer, he used his understanding of the
[67:00] constitution to overcome it specifically
[67:03] so he could do things like kill American
[67:06] children abroad using drone bombing.
[67:08] Like that that happened. That's like a
[67:10] real thing. And I find it deeply
[67:13] alarming that people want to be like,
[67:14] well, you know, he was the son of a
[67:17] terrorist. Like that's And it's like,
[67:18] oh, I didn't I didn't realize like when
[67:20] we disagree with people, we can kill
[67:22] their children, particularly when
[67:23] they're Americans as well. Hm.
[67:26] Interesting.
[67:28] Give the man another Nobel Peace Prize.
[67:30] Amazing. Like, wow. No, nothing says uh
[67:34] nothing says peace like bombs, but I
[67:36] guess Nobel, you know, and dynamite.
[67:37] That's his whole stick, right? Yeah.
[67:39] Yeah. Right. it kind of kind of worked
[67:41] together. No, I I I think it's going to
[67:44] be very interesting to see what happens
[67:47] in these next few years and decades
[67:49] because I think there's no denying that
[67:51] we are in the middle of a of a fourth
[67:53] turning. Uh I'm also of the opinion uh
[67:56] this is a thesis I'm working on. I might
[67:58] even have to write about it, but that
[67:59] we're seeing a convergence of cycles. If
[68:02] you're familiar with Pibius's ancycosis,
[68:05] like we also seem to be somewhere near
[68:08] the end of that cycle uh in the
[68:10] uglcracy, like near verging on the mob
[68:12] rule sense. We're in the midst of a
[68:15] long-term debt cycle. If you look at Ray
[68:16] Dalio's, we're in the midst of a bunch
[68:18] of other like all these different cycles
[68:20] that have been proposed by various
[68:21] thinkers. We seem to be nearing the
[68:23] tipping point of all of them. And I
[68:25] think that's going to make for very uh
[68:27] very drastic and violent change. And I
[68:31] mean violent both in the uh let's say uh
[68:34] metaphorical sense like but then also
[68:36] probably in the lit literal sense like
[68:38] the that's typically how things happen
[68:40] when there's massive changes is there is
[68:41] violence. I mean a little bit to the
[68:43] south of you guys right now in
[68:45] California there is a lot of violence
[68:47] going on. Um I I don't know how that's
[68:49] going to resolve itself.
[68:51] Maybe it just won't. It seems that these
[68:53] things tend not to resolve themselves
[68:55] but they're mostly peaceful so it's
[68:56] okay. But
[68:59] how do you guys prepare for the like are
[69:04] you are you building for the world that
[69:06] is now or are you building for the world
[69:07] that is to come? Is it a little bit of
[69:09] both? Because like I think you're the
[69:11] only company that is tackling both sides
[69:13] of this again the let's say the
[69:14] cryptographic side of this and the uh
[69:17] the very physical human side of this.
[69:20] How do you like build with the
[69:22] structures we have now, but then prepare
[69:23] yourself for what may be an incredibly
[69:26] tumultuous period where the
[69:27] reorganization of the world makes it
[69:29] look vastly different than it is today?
[69:33] We live in the future basically like we
[69:36] we're we're already in the hyper
[69:37] bitcoinized world and we're just working
[69:40] backwards from there. And we think
[69:41] that's something that
[69:44] almost no Bitcoin company and and few
[69:48] Bitcoiners really have the conviction
[69:51] about hyper Bitcoinization and really
[69:54] take it seriously and really believe
[69:56] with 100% certainty that that's where
[69:59] we're headed that that is going to
[70:01] happen that there's going to be massive
[70:03] disruption because of it. And we are
[70:07] that's our base case. We're we we know
[70:10] that's happening for sure. And so we're
[70:13] trying to think through, okay, if that
[70:15] is happening, what kind of companies do
[70:18] we need to exist? What kind of products
[70:20] do we need to exist? What kind of
[70:21] services? What kind of political
[70:24] philosophies? What kind of legal
[70:25] frameworks? What are the things that we
[70:28] need to put in place right now so that
[70:30] when this event arrives, we're ready for
[70:33] it. We're prepared for it. and that
[70:36] ideally we it can be nonviolent or at
[70:39] least the minimum amount of violence
[70:41] that can occur because if we can plan in
[70:43] advance and if we can put the right
[70:45] systems in place it doesn't need to be
[70:47] violent. it doesn't need to um take that
[70:51] form. And that's one of the most um
[70:54] powerful things about Bitcoin that we've
[70:56] never had before in history, which is
[70:58] that we can completely transform the
[71:02] legal, economic, and political system
[71:05] without any um coercion whatsoever. Just
[71:09] by providing a superior alternative,
[71:13] that's going to create the change. Just
[71:15] by providing ideas, by providing
[71:18] mathematics, by providing technology
[71:20] that will win people over and we can
[71:24] establish our moral superiority to the
[71:27] status quo because the status quo is its
[71:31] essence is violence. That's how it
[71:33] operates. Everything is coercive.
[71:35] Everything is threw at the, you know,
[71:38] the barrel of the gun or a jack booted
[71:40] thug. Like that's how it operates.
[71:42] That's how it thinks for any kind of
[71:45] social change. It can only do that
[71:47] through throwing people in cages.
[71:50] Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin doesn't
[71:53] need to use those mechanisms to create
[71:56] change. And that's a bright line that we
[72:01] are drawing to say how we are different
[72:04] from the status quo. how we're going to
[72:06] win over the hearts and minds because we
[72:09] have a better system that is more
[72:12] peaceful, that is more beneficial, that
[72:15] is more free. And so we think a lot
[72:18] about the future. We think a lot about
[72:21] how to prepare today for what's coming.
[72:25] And Eric and I have been in in Bitcoin
[72:28] for a while now. and and we kind of have
[72:30] a track record of being able to
[72:32] anticipate things that nobody thinks are
[72:35] going to happen and yet they occur. And
[72:38] so we're just kind of bringing that to
[72:39] the next level. Yeah. Yeah. And that
[72:41] that's one of the reasons that's allowed
[72:43] for us to start designing it in the way
[72:45] that it is. Cuz it's really only even
[72:47] been in the last few years that the
[72:49] technologies have been available to
[72:52] actually try to be able to build a truly
[72:54] open-source and verifiable computer from
[72:58] silicone software like these FPGAAS uh
[73:01] like the new Tropic Square chip. Like
[73:03] the these are all very new advancements.
[73:06] And then when you start to pair this
[73:07] stuff with the advancements that we're
[73:08] seeing in AI, with the advancements that
[73:10] we've been seeing in drone tech, like
[73:13] there becomes a very different future
[73:15] that's available where the asymmetric
[73:18] relationship between the state violent
[73:22] actors and the individual allows for
[73:24] itself to actually become much more
[73:26] equalized. And so like I feel very
[73:29] confident that within 5 years that any
[73:32] individual that has a VORV vault at
[73:34] their house, there is going to be
[73:36] triggers that are going to allow for
[73:38] them to deploy their drone surveillance
[73:41] and anybody that has came to that house
[73:44] will be marked and surveiled. Like their
[73:46] gate recognition will be tracked and
[73:48] that that information will be used to
[73:51] identify them. And like that's something
[73:53] that we think is really important
[73:55] because we want violent thugs and
[73:58] criminals to know like you you won't
[74:00] have somewhere to hide. Like you have
[74:01] now permanently branded and marked
[74:03] yourself with that you are an individual
[74:06] that will go after our customers and we
[74:08] have an entire team and division of
[74:11] people that are dedicated to finding you
[74:13] and bringing you to justice. And that's
[74:16] because we now exist at this end state
[74:19] where the law is a highly dysfunctional
[74:22] thing. And if somebody does choose to
[74:25] rob you legal or otherwise, in other
[74:28] words, the state choosing to steal from
[74:29] you or criminals, it it's not clear if
[74:33] justice will actually be delivered. And
[74:35] that's one of the reasons that we really
[74:36] believe that we need to start empowering
[74:38] ourselves and taking this into our own
[74:40] hands. Because if we allow for ourselves
[74:44] to get to a hyper bitcoinized world
[74:46] without a product like this, it's going
[74:48] to be much more threatening, difficult,
[74:50] and scary. And the truth is is it's
[74:52] going to be much more violent. And it's
[74:54] going to be much more violent because we
[74:55] won't have active deterrent solutions
[74:59] that people will know and understand and
[75:01] will be branded towards that. And so,
[75:03] uh,
[75:05] you know, and the other one is is that,
[75:07] uh, like as as large and as much
[75:11] potential as this company has, again, it
[75:13] comes back to like we're building this
[75:15] for philosophical reasons. Like it's
[75:17] really important to us to have this
[75:19] product out in the world. Not because
[75:21] it's going to make us both a bunch of
[75:23] money, but because people deserve to
[75:26] have this new and different upgrade that
[75:28] truly allows for them to to have
[75:30] sovereign custody of their Bitcoin
[75:32] rather than needing to collaborate with
[75:33] somebody for that sovereignty or just
[75:36] try to take it all on their own. I mean,
[75:38] to that point, Eric, you've and Jesse,
[75:41] I'm not sure about your situation, but
[75:42] Eric, I mean, you you came out of
[75:44] retirement for this basically. uh like
[75:47] this is not something uh you let's say
[75:50] were forced to do. Uh and by the way,
[75:53] did you guys do you guys meet at
[75:55] Coinbase? Is that how you guys Yeah, it
[75:57] was uh Wow. I I would do like
[75:59] introduction coin conversations for like
[76:01] any new employees. And it was funny cuz
[76:04] Jesse came in was like, "Hey, like I'm
[76:05] Eric. Like I I love Bitcoin because of
[76:07] this like deeper philosophical aspect
[76:10] that I'm really into." And he was like,
[76:11] "Oh, wow." He was like, "Do you like
[76:13] know about this like philosopher Carl
[76:15] Schmidt?" And I was like, "Yeah, I'm
[76:17] like actually really well read in Carl
[76:19] Schmidt." And we were like both just
[76:20] blown away immediately. And that really
[76:23] became the basis of, you know, what is
[76:26] now our long and deep standing
[76:27] friendship is that like not only were we
[76:30] both Bitcoiners before and came in with
[76:31] this deep philosophical commitment
[76:33] towards Bitcoin, but we we both truly
[76:36] believe that Bitcoin has the potential
[76:37] to change the world in a radical way,
[76:39] but only if we take responsibility for
[76:41] it. And so for me, like, you know, I I'd
[76:45] sort of done my retirement thing, but
[76:47] the truth is is within that, uh, you you
[76:50] have this idea that you'll sort of ride
[76:52] off into the sunset and then you get out
[76:55] there and you're like, "Huh, like this
[76:56] is kind of boring to be honest with
[76:58] you." And also like there's these other
[77:00] things that need to be built that are
[77:02] really important. Like why aren't these
[77:03] people why aren't these things being
[77:05] built? Uh, and furthermore, like I need
[77:08] that challenge for myself. And after
[77:10] really taking some time and energy to
[77:12] think about it, I realized like
[77:15] uh frankly like nobody else can actually
[77:18] build this because like we're the only
[77:20] people with this unique perspective.
[77:23] We're the only people that have this
[77:25] philosophical background. I mean Jesse
[77:28] is arguably one of the best applied
[77:30] cryptographers in the world. Uh like I
[77:33] seem to have some of the deepest and
[77:35] most philosophically aligned thoughts
[77:37] with Bitcoin. And furthermore, because
[77:40] we're not motivated by the fiat
[77:42] short-term incentives, there's an
[77:44] ability to build a company that has a
[77:47] 20, 50, and 100year timeline in front of
[77:50] it. And that's what we're building. You
[77:52] know, like I I've wrote a philosophical
[77:54] document that is like it's a 20page
[77:56] document about like what Vora is. And
[77:58] like in that we talk about the year 2045
[78:00] and what Vora is doing and how the
[78:02] product has developed from there. And
[78:05] like the only reason that we can do that
[78:06] is because we're we're not concerned
[78:09] with quarters but with epochs. Like
[78:12] we're not concerned with making sure
[78:15] that uh we satisfy the short-term fiat
[78:19] gains, but that we look at the long-term
[78:22] Bitcoin sustainability of the company.
[78:24] And I think that's only really available
[78:26] for people that have been involved in
[78:27] the space for a long time and thought
[78:29] very deeply and intently about what
[78:32] Bitcoin is and how it's going to change
[78:34] the world. Yeah. And we're going to
[78:36] actually build that into the
[78:37] compensation structure for every single
[78:40] employee at the company. That part of
[78:43] their future compensation is going to be
[78:46] time locked Bitcoin that is stored in a
[78:49] Vora vault in their own home. So, if
[78:53] this system is not safe for our
[78:55] customers, it's not safe for the
[78:57] employees. And you better believe
[78:58] they're going to be extra motivated to
[79:00] protect that privacy, to make sure the
[79:03] alarm system works, to make sure there's
[79:05] no back doors because all the incentives
[79:07] will be aligned. That's I mean, that's
[79:09] that's actually brilliant. That is quite
[79:12] possibly the most like uh uh alignment
[79:16] enforcing incentive structure I've ever
[79:19] heard of. That's that's genius.
[79:22] Yeah, I I I love that. Well, I'm
[79:25] curious. Can you guys talk at all about
[79:26] the uh the actual home vault side of it
[79:29] all without like, you know, I don't want
[79:31] you guys to uh give away anything that
[79:32] shouldn't be given away, but like
[79:34] whatever you can talk about. Can we get
[79:35] into a little bit more of like some of
[79:37] the nitty-g gritties there cuz you
[79:39] mentioned just like a lot of these
[79:40] supply chain concerns and and all this
[79:43] like can you talk through that a little
[79:44] bit like why that's actually important,
[79:46] what that means, how you guys are
[79:47] addressing it? Yeah, absolutely. because
[79:50] you know a lot of Bitcoiners they insist
[79:53] on multi- vendor multi-IG for good
[79:56] reason because they're worried about
[79:57] supply chain attacks. Um we want to uh
[80:02] provide something where you know a
[80:04] customer is going to feel safe working
[80:05] with a single vendor Vora without
[80:07] needing to diversify among multiple
[80:10] hardware wallets. Other Bitcoiners I
[80:12] know, they insist on commodity hardware
[80:14] where, you know, they consider any
[80:17] specialized Bitcoin hardware is is
[80:19] subject to a supply chain attack. They
[80:22] want to be able to walk into a random
[80:24] Best Buy, pick a chip at random, and,
[80:27] you know, use that to secure their
[80:28] Bitcoin because the likelihood, real
[80:30] quick, just for uh people that don't
[80:32] know, what exactly is a supply chain
[80:33] attack? Yeah. So, supply chain attack
[80:36] can take different forms. I mean the
[80:38] first form it could take is that the
[80:40] chip when it's manufactured there's a
[80:43] backdoor in the actual atomic structure
[80:47] of the chip itself.
[80:49] Another form of supply chain attack can
[80:51] be even if the physical structure of the
[80:53] chip um it has full integrity that the
[80:57] microode which is the lowest level
[80:59] software that lives on the chip is
[81:01] compromised and in most cases that
[81:04] microode is completely opaque. it's not
[81:07] open source. There's no way to verify
[81:08] it. Another form of supply chain attack
[81:11] is that the actual um chip is swapped
[81:17] out somewhere between when it's made and
[81:19] when it gets into the customer's hands.
[81:22] And we've seen very sophisticated
[81:24] attacks by organized crime against um
[81:27] credit card readers, against um all
[81:30] kinds of uh hardened systems um where
[81:34] they've been able to swap out the
[81:36] hardware and uh and we have no idea what
[81:39] kind of nation state level attacks might
[81:42] be applied to Intel or AMD or or any of
[81:45] these chips. And so that's the
[81:48] foundation of the hardware wallet. If
[81:51] the chip is compromised, the whole
[81:52] system is compromised. For example, you
[81:56] know, to generate a cryptographic key
[81:58] relies on entropy. It relies on
[82:01] randomness that no one else can predict.
[82:03] But if the chip is compromised, if the
[82:05] microode is compromised, if the physical
[82:08] structure of the chip is compromised, it
[82:10] can produce keys according to patterns
[82:13] that some attacker knows and they can
[82:17] wait a very long time before they
[82:19] perform the attack. they can wait for
[82:21] hyper Bitcoinization to happen before
[82:23] they take everybody's Bitcoin. And so
[82:27] defending against these attacks is of of
[82:30] paramount importance. And we've put a
[82:32] lot of time and energy to figure out how
[82:34] to do this in a way that nobody else is
[82:36] doing. And so, you know, the like I
[82:40] said, the the actual physical enclosure
[82:42] of the vault is a server rack. And we
[82:45] specifically chose that because we don't
[82:47] want it to be obvious to your guests
[82:49] that you have a ton of Bitcoin at your
[82:50] home. So it just looks like, hey, I've
[82:52] got like, you know, a server. No big
[82:54] deal. In that server rack, we have an
[82:57] offline component and an air gap and an
[83:01] online component. And you know, we're
[83:03] still in R&D. You know, some of these
[83:06] details may change. We have a plan for a
[83:08] prototype. Eventually, we're going to
[83:09] have custom boards. But what we're
[83:11] looking at for the prototype is first of
[83:14] all the the offline component has um a
[83:17] chip called an FPGA
[83:19] which is a programmable chip and there's
[83:23] a specific chip called the ICE40 that
[83:25] has a completely open-source tool chain
[83:28] and an open- source bitstream. So you
[83:31] can using open- source tools you can
[83:34] download um the con hardware
[83:37] configuration for the chip compile it
[83:39] yourself and load it onto the chip. So
[83:42] that removes the microode attack where
[83:45] there's no software layer on the chip
[83:47] that's opaque um that can be that you
[83:51] haven't built and inspected yourself.
[83:54] And the um other thing that can be done
[83:58] with an FPGA
[84:00] is you can randomize the layout. So
[84:02] there's different ways to program the
[84:04] gate arrays in the chip that provide the
[84:07] same functionality. So if you're an
[84:09] attacker who tried to compromise the way
[84:12] the transistors are laid out in the
[84:14] chip, the fact that we're randomizing
[84:17] the layout makes it much more difficult
[84:19] for the attacker to be able to predict
[84:21] what physical part of the chip they need
[84:23] to compromise.
[84:25] On top of that, what we're going to do
[84:27] is we're going to select um we're going
[84:31] to for every one of these vaults, we're
[84:33] going to have three FPGA chips. We're
[84:36] going to select one at random and ship
[84:38] that to the customer. Take the other two
[84:40] chips, delid them, and put them under an
[84:43] electron microscope and send the results
[84:46] to the customer. So you So if there's a
[84:50] hardware attack, that attacker would
[84:52] have to have picked the one of the three
[84:55] chips that we select at random and
[84:57] attacked that and not the other two. So
[85:00] there's a very high chance that we're
[85:01] going to catch that hardware attack.
[85:04] That's step one.
[85:07] Now, we also have the online portion of
[85:11] the box. So, we're using a um a Raptor
[85:14] Blackboard motherboard, which is the one
[85:16] of is the only open- source motherboard.
[85:19] There's also Talos, but they're all made
[85:21] by Raptor. So, the whole firmware, the
[85:23] whole BIOS, everything about the board
[85:26] is open source. It uses an IBM Power 9
[85:29] chip which um has open- source microode
[85:34] and that's the server component of the
[85:36] chip that's always online. And the uh
[85:40] when we when the vault signs for keys,
[85:43] it's going to have um a two of two
[85:46] between those two chips. Um but not just
[85:50] a two of two. So we're also considering
[85:52] to add the Tropic Square chip, which is
[85:54] this brand new chip. um that uh that has
[85:59] been specifically designed for hardware
[86:01] wallets and it has some of the
[86:03] best-in-class tamper detection
[86:05] technology. So if that chip is tampered
[86:09] with, it will wipe its secrets. So we
[86:11] can actually do a three of three between
[86:13] all three chips. So all of them would
[86:16] have to be backdoored. All of them would
[86:18] have to be compromised for a hardware
[86:20] supply chain attack to succeed. And then
[86:23] the last thing we're doing is we're
[86:25] going to have an open socket on the
[86:27] motherboard. So if you do want to go to
[86:29] Best Buy and buy a chip at random, you
[86:32] can plop that in into the motherboard.
[86:35] And now all four chips have to be
[86:37] backdoored in order to compromise the
[86:40] system. And so now we're way beyond
[86:42] multi-endor multi-IG because even with
[86:44] multi-endor multi-IG,
[86:47] all of the vendors could be compromised.
[86:49] Like your treasure and your ledger could
[86:51] be compromised. And so with this kind of
[86:53] four force setup with all these measures
[86:56] that we're putting into place, the
[86:58] probability of a hardware supply chain
[87:00] attack taking place against the system
[87:03] becomes negligible.
[87:06] Jesus Christ.
[87:09] He's a good guy. I mean that like that
[87:12] that's just uh like kind of awesome. No.
[87:16] Okay. My natural next question though is
[87:18] like all these things you're talking
[87:20] about being able to verify all these
[87:21] things. How do you envision this
[87:24] presenting to the actual end user though
[87:26] because presumably there are a lot of
[87:28] people with a lot of Bitcoin who may be
[87:31] uh technically not as literate as you
[87:34] would imagine they would be having so
[87:35] much Bitcoin. Is this still something
[87:37] where on the like the you know uh the
[87:39] UIUX side you're looking at making this
[87:42] very uh comfortable for the let's say
[87:45] the the Bitcoin layman who has in a
[87:48] hyper bitcoinized world still
[87:49] accumulated a fortune of coin but you
[87:52] know he is not uh or she is not a very
[87:56] technical quote person. Well, and that
[87:58] that's the next component that comes
[88:00] along is that like right now this is all
[88:02] buildable. Like you could you could
[88:03] build this out on your own. It would
[88:05] have some difficulties for it, but it's
[88:08] not even that technically difficult.
[88:10] What we want to do is we really want to
[88:12] position ourselves as being the apple of
[88:13] Bitcoin so that you have this high-end
[88:16] premium product that you're going to pay
[88:18] extra for, but it means that you plug
[88:20] this in and you now have a Bitcoin full
[88:22] node. You have a beautiful new and
[88:24] different UX. Uh we're really excited
[88:26] about the designer that we've been
[88:28] working with. He has deep expertise and
[88:30] understanding in Bitcoin and wants to
[88:32] approach it differently as well. And we
[88:34] think that there is a massive
[88:36] opportunity to essentially take the full
[88:38] Bitcoin vertical, make that into a great
[88:42] Appleike presentation to have a
[88:44] plug-and-play solution that's easy,
[88:46] intuitive, and uh fluid to use. But once
[88:50] you've established that, we're also
[88:52] doing sort of the Tesla market approach
[88:54] in that this is first going to be a
[88:56] premium product that's designed for
[88:58] whole coiners, but as it addresses the
[89:00] market, that market then expands out to
[89:03] where eventually like what we really
[89:04] want to be is uh in people's personal
[89:08] home data server. Cuz the world that
[89:10] we're moving into, everyone's going to
[89:12] need to have their own personal data
[89:14] server if they're going to want to run,
[89:15] say, an LLM that will be both their
[89:18] personal assistant have personal
[89:20] information and health information about
[89:22] them. And you're going to need to have
[89:24] the same degree of security for that
[89:25] information as you're going to need for
[89:27] your Bitcoin. And furthermore, as all of
[89:31] these vaults are deployed, there becomes
[89:32] a real opportunity to make them
[89:34] interoperable with each other on their
[89:36] own protocol level using the
[89:38] cryptographic key storage that we have
[89:40] on there. So now we've actually gone
[89:43] from being just a Bitcoin vault to now
[89:46] we're a decentralized cryptographic key
[89:49] storage provider that has essentially a
[89:51] decentralized cloud solution that is
[89:54] interoperable with other safes. So the
[89:57] ultimate mission is is going to be that
[89:59] let's say you are one of these ultra
[90:00] high netw wealth individuals that has
[90:02] your place in Aspen, New York and
[90:04] France. you can have your three nodes
[90:07] all running in tandem with each other,
[90:10] communicating to each other and
[90:11] verifying for each other so that like if
[90:14] uh the socialists in France choose to
[90:16] like seize your property in France,
[90:19] well, it turns out that it's backed up
[90:20] and stored on the other servers that you
[90:23] have because of the way that they've
[90:24] been programmed to collaborate with each
[90:26] other. So, these are all distant ideas,
[90:29] but this is the big vision we're going
[90:31] for. Cuz the other one that we found in
[90:33] conversations with people that we find
[90:35] uh almost ridiculous in some ways is
[90:37] that a lot of people think really small,
[90:39] like they don't they really don't fully
[90:42] embrace that Bitcoin is going to
[90:44] transform the world and that it that's
[90:46] already happening. And I thought it was
[90:48] interesting even earlier today, somebody
[90:50] said like Bitcoin penetration is
[90:52] essentially zero at this point in time.
[90:54] Like it's still totally new. And with
[90:56] that perspective, we can allow for
[90:58] ourselves to step back and say, "Well,
[91:00] if that is true, and if Bitcoin is going
[91:02] to keep conquering and kicking ass, as
[91:03] it has over the last 10 years, there is
[91:06] not only a massive opportunity, but
[91:08] probably the most massive opportunity to
[91:11] build on top of the tech stack to make
[91:13] something truly incredible." And very
[91:16] similar to if you asked Steve Jobs in
[91:18] 1978 like, "Hey, like where do you think
[91:20] the world's at in 1995?" he would tell
[91:22] you, "Yeah, there's going to be an Apple
[91:24] computer in most homes in the United
[91:26] States." People would laugh at you. And
[91:28] that's what the reality became. And
[91:30] that's what we believe Vora has the
[91:32] opportunity to do as well. Is that
[91:33] because of the way and direction that
[91:35] both Bitcoin and the internet are
[91:37] moving, people are going to need to have
[91:39] their own home data servers that will
[91:41] have very strong cryptographic and
[91:43] security protections. And absolutely
[91:45] nobody is approaching that market right
[91:47] now despite the fact that this is
[91:49] arguably a multi-trillion dollar market
[91:51] cap. Yeah. And 100% it's it's going to
[91:55] be easy to use. It's going to be
[91:57] plugandplay. You don't have to be
[91:59] technical at all. That's a big
[92:02] limitation of the current systems is the
[92:04] level of education and knowledge you
[92:06] have to have to use self-custody is a
[92:10] huge barrier. And even for experts, it's
[92:12] easy to screw it up. It's easy. You make
[92:14] one mistake and the whole system doesn't
[92:17] work. And so UX and security go hand in
[92:20] hand and it should it should take care
[92:23] of foot guns. It should guide the user
[92:26] through the process in such a way that
[92:28] anybody can use it. Bitcoin we want, you
[92:31] know, everybody who wants to use Bitcoin
[92:34] to be able to use Bitcoin. No matter how
[92:36] technical or non-technical you are,
[92:39] self- sovereignty belongs to everyone.
[92:41] And so that's our goal. And you know, in
[92:45] terms of what Eric is talking about with
[92:46] the with the um kind of decentralized
[92:50] network that the vaults can bootstrap,
[92:52] this trusted execution technology that I
[92:54] talked about for the server also exists
[92:57] in every Vora vault. So every Vora vault
[93:00] can also have a trusted ex has a trusted
[93:04] execution environment that can provide a
[93:06] remote attestation.
[93:08] And there's completely new types of
[93:10] decentralized networks, not with a
[93:13] token. There's no new token here, but a
[93:16] decentralized network where um each node
[93:20] in the network is providing a remote
[93:23] attestation telling the other nodes the
[93:26] code that it's running. And so we can
[93:29] build all kinds of new applications on
[93:31] top of that. decentralized cloud
[93:34] storage, decentralized PIN servers,
[93:36] decentralized blind signers, all the
[93:39] stuff that we're doing with our server,
[93:41] eventually we'll be able to decentralize
[93:43] across the vault network.
[93:46] And one of the big breakthroughs in
[93:48] terms of UX that we're going to deliver
[93:51] is we're going to revolutionize the
[93:55] Bitcoin address, not with the technology
[93:57] we invented, but we're going to actually
[93:59] deploy it, which is what Eric alluded to
[94:02] uh earlier, which is silent payments.
[94:05] And part of silent payments is privacy.
[94:09] But the other thing about silent
[94:10] payments is we're going to be able to
[94:12] have a human readable static identifier
[94:16] as your Bitcoin address. So my Bitcoin
[94:19] address is going to be Jessevora.io.
[94:24] That's my Bitcoin address. Not 1 CX345
[94:28] whatever. It's human readable. It's
[94:31] static
[94:33] and it's also completely private. That's
[94:36] what silent payments, that's what's so
[94:38] powerful about silent payments. And
[94:41] right now, addresses are a UX nightmare.
[94:43] You have to generate a brand new one.
[94:46] And every time you do that, you have to
[94:48] secure it. You have to figure out, is
[94:50] this the person's address? Did it get
[94:53] man-in-the-middle? How do I actually
[94:55] verify that this is their correct
[94:57] address? And so this is going to help us
[95:00] secure Bitcoin addresses because you can
[95:02] have the most fancy key management key
[95:05] arrangement multi-IG system in the
[95:07] world. If the address is compromised, it
[95:10] doesn't matter. You're going to send all
[95:11] your Bitcoin to the attacker's address.
[95:14] So one of the big hang-ups with silent
[95:16] payments, the reason we haven't seen it
[95:18] more widely deployed is because they
[95:21] don't work well with light clients. You
[95:24] can't do silent payments on your phone.
[95:27] You need a full node to scan every block
[95:30] to do a diffy helman derivation for
[95:33] every single input to find the silent
[95:35] payment addresses. And most people
[95:37] aren't running full nodes. And
[95:39] especially if you're not technically
[95:41] inclined, it's not that easy to set it
[95:43] up and keep it up all the time and
[95:45] figure out how to connect it to your
[95:47] Bitcoin wallet. And so by having an
[95:49] integrated full node in the box, this
[95:52] means that we can also have silent
[95:54] payments for all of our customers and
[95:57] now we can have these human readable
[95:59] Bitcoin addresses. C can you uh can you
[96:01] just uh explain again in like a a more
[96:04] layman terms what the significance of
[96:07] the silent payment is? How that actually
[96:08] works just so for anyone who's listening
[96:10] and is like yes I I I understand that I
[96:13] think but like what is the significance
[96:15] of this for you guys and why does this
[96:17] actually matter? Why should anyone care
[96:18] about this? Yeah. So, you know, it
[96:22] starts with the principle of, you know,
[96:25] in Bitcoin, we never want to reuse
[96:27] addresses. You know, we we could have
[96:30] one address. You know, a lot of people
[96:32] do this. You put like a a tipping
[96:34] address on your website,
[96:37] but and then everybody can send to it,
[96:39] but now you have a privacy problem
[96:41] because all your payments are linked to
[96:43] this one address. And in terms of making
[96:47] it human readable, basically you can use
[96:50] um secure DNS to take a uh like a human
[96:55] address, a human readable address,
[96:57] connect to a server and it would resolve
[97:00] with some data like a bitcoin address or
[97:03] a public key. So if address if address
[97:06] reuse wasn't a problem, we could do that
[97:09] just with the Bitcoin technology that
[97:10] exists today. You'd have something that
[97:12] looks like an email address. it would
[97:15] verify um assert against the domain name
[97:19] that's signed by the domain's key so you
[97:22] know it isn't man-in-the-middle and it
[97:24] would resolve to the Bitcoin address
[97:28] but because of address reuse there's a
[97:30] privacy problem so that's why Xpubs were
[97:33] invented now with Xpubs you could have
[97:36] an Xpub where you could you know put an
[97:39] Xpub out there and you could derive a
[97:42] new address from the Xpub
[97:44] and anybody who wants to send you
[97:46] Bitcoin could derive a new address. But
[97:48] the problem with the Xpub is anybody who
[97:50] has the Xpub, they can derive all the
[97:52] addresses and they know they belong to
[97:55] the same wallet. So if you make your
[97:57] Xpub public, it doesn't really help in
[97:59] in terms of privacy. It helps a wallet
[98:02] internally be able to generate many many
[98:05] addresses, new addresses, you know, um
[98:09] you know, you're using your hardware
[98:10] wallet, you're generating a new address.
[98:13] that's all being derived from the same
[98:15] root public key using uh an Xpub. But if
[98:18] you give that Xpub to somebody, now they
[98:21] can derive all your addresses, which is
[98:23] the problem with a lot of these
[98:24] collaborative custodian systems is they
[98:26] have everybody's Xpubs and they can
[98:28] derive everybody's addresses. So, Silent
[98:31] Payments was created to solve this
[98:33] problem where you have a static public
[98:36] key that never changes and you give this
[98:40] public key to everybody that you want to
[98:42] send you Bitcoin or you make it
[98:44] resolvable with a human readable domain
[98:48] where they look up the human readable
[98:50] address and they get the public key. But
[98:53] then they do something called a diffy
[98:54] helman derivation. And Diffy Helman is
[98:58] um one of the foundational cryptographic
[99:00] innovations that revolutionized
[99:04] um cryptography
[99:06] uh in the 70s and made it is at the
[99:09] basis of you know when you connect to a
[99:11] website with HTTPS
[99:14] underneath it is a diffy helman
[99:16] derivation and what diffy helman is is
[99:20] that if you take a public key and a
[99:23] private key. Let's say you have Alice
[99:26] and Bob. Alice has a private key and
[99:31] gets Bob's public key.
[99:33] And Alice can take her private key and
[99:36] combine it with Bob's public key to
[99:40] generate a number
[99:43] to generate a secret.
[99:46] Now Bob
[99:48] can take Alice's public key and his
[99:52] private key and derive the exact same
[99:55] secret.
[99:57] So let's say Alice and Bob are
[100:00] communicating over an insecure channel.
[100:03] You have Eve, the eavesdropper can see
[100:06] any of the data that Alice sends to Bob
[100:09] or Bob sends to Alice. They need to
[100:12] establish a secure communications
[100:15] channel such that the eavesdropper can't
[100:19] um decrypt the data. And so if if they
[100:23] just sent a secret over the channel,
[100:25] well, Eve's going to read the secret and
[100:28] they're screwed. So instead, what can
[100:31] happen is Alice sends her public key
[100:34] over the channel to Bob and Bob sends
[100:38] his public key over the channel to
[100:39] Alice. So they have each other's public
[100:41] keys. Now that they have these each
[100:44] other's public keys, they do this Diffy
[100:46] Helman derivation on each side and they
[100:49] derive the same secret.
[100:52] But Eve can't derive that secret because
[100:54] the only way to derive that secret is
[100:57] she would need to know either Alice's
[100:59] private key or Bob's private key.
[101:04] And without either of those private
[101:06] keys, and those private keys aren't sent
[101:08] over the channel,
[101:10] it's impossible to derive this secret.
[101:12] And once they both have a common secret,
[101:15] they can use that as an encryption and
[101:17] decryption key to encrypt their data and
[101:20] send messages back and forth and
[101:22] authenticate those messages. So, silent
[101:25] payments uses the same principle, which
[101:27] is if I want to send you Bitcoin and I
[101:31] know your public key, I can do a diffy
[101:34] helman derivation with my private key
[101:37] and generate a a shared secret and embed
[101:39] that into a Bitcoin address.
[101:43] And the only person who can find that
[101:45] address on the blockchain, even if I
[101:47] know your public key, if I don't know
[101:49] the private key of the sender, I don't
[101:52] know that secret and I can't find it on
[101:55] the blockchain.
[101:56] And so now we only need this one public
[101:59] key. We don't need an exp. We just have
[102:01] a static public key that never changes,
[102:04] but each sender can generate a unique
[102:07] secret
[102:08] that only they and the recipient can
[102:11] identify.
[102:12] And the reason you need a full node is
[102:15] to the recipient
[102:18] to identify their transactions on the
[102:20] blockchain. Unlike an Xpub where it's a
[102:22] very simple calculation and they can
[102:25] just look up the addresses, they need to
[102:27] scan through every single input in every
[102:29] single new block. Do this diffy helman
[102:32] derivation to see, oh, is this a payment
[102:35] that was sent to me? And you can't do
[102:38] that on a phone. And you need a full
[102:40] node to do that.
[102:42] Unless you want to offload that to some
[102:44] server or some third party um service
[102:48] that then is going to learn all your
[102:49] transactions and your Bitcoin balance in
[102:52] the process.
[102:53] I I I appreciate very much the
[102:55] explanation because I think it's like
[102:57] sometimes these terms are thrown around
[102:59] and again like this is a product that
[103:01] can help uh the non-technical people
[103:04] too. like this is not something that you
[103:06] need to be an expert cryptographer to be
[103:08] able to use, but it helps to be able to
[103:10] understand some of the uh the stuff
[103:12] going on behind it so you understand why
[103:14] it's so powerful for you and why this
[103:16] actually helps to preserve your privacy
[103:19] not just from anyone who you know Eve
[103:21] the eavesdropper but from the vendor
[103:23] who's actually providing you with the
[103:24] solution in the first place which is
[103:26] arguably more dangerous potentially.
[103:30] Absolutely. Wasn't that a great
[103:31] explanation of a Diffy Helman exchange?
[103:33] The first time that he explained that to
[103:35] me when we were at his house one night,
[103:36] I was like, "Wo, like that's how
[103:38] cryptography works. That's amazing."
[103:41] Yeah. Honestly, that was that was
[103:43] incredible cuz I've like read around
[103:46] this stuff before and that was the
[103:48] single best explanation that I've uh
[103:50] that I've ever seen about it. And I feel
[103:52] like I I just gained like I I gained a
[103:54] little bit more intelligence there. So,
[103:55] I appreciate it. Um, I I want to be
[103:57] conscious of your guys' time, but I also
[103:58] want to make sure was there anything
[104:00] else from the the Vora product or the
[104:02] Vora philosophy that we didn't get a
[104:04] chance to uh kind of cover here today.
[104:08] Uh, the only one I want to point out is
[104:11] so vora comes from the Latin term
[104:14] melivora capensus which is the honey
[104:16] badger. And you can see we have this
[104:18] nice piece of swag and we have our nice
[104:20] honeybger logo. And the reason why is
[104:23] because uh like Bitcoin is the honey
[104:26] badger of money. And we believe that
[104:28] that honeybadger of money. It's the
[104:31] honeybger doesn't tolerate what we've
[104:33] called the honeybger's dilemma where
[104:35] they're forced to choose between 6102
[104:37] attack or wrench attack. The the
[104:39] honeybger intransigently refuses to be
[104:43] attacked on either side and will
[104:45] viciously attack and defend itself. And
[104:48] that's the goal of Vora is we want your
[104:49] Vora vault to be the thing that displays
[104:52] your self-s sovereignty in the world and
[104:54] will viciously attack and defend you
[104:56] against either one of these attack
[104:57] vectors. Uh and we invite you please
[105:00] come to to vora.io, sign up for our wait
[105:02] list for when we're going to start doing
[105:04] marketing and advertising. And uh yeah,
[105:07] this is just the beginning of of a very
[105:09] long uh and probably at times difficult
[105:11] journey, but we really want to become
[105:13] the premier and preliminary Bitcoin
[105:16] brand in the world because this is where
[105:18] we're at and we do need to have uh this
[105:22] full stack available to us. That's
[105:24] really going to make the message clear
[105:25] that Bitcoin is here to stay. It's not
[105:27] going away. a hyper bitcoinization is
[105:29] going to happen and everybody from the
[105:31] technical to the non-technical is
[105:34] welcome to these solutions and it's our
[105:36] market that we want to address.
[105:39] Yeah. And and uh and don't dox yourself,
[105:43] you know, use a a temporary email
[105:45] address or something that isn't linked
[105:47] to your identity for our email list. We
[105:50] don't want to know the emails of all the
[105:52] Bitcoiners that have all the biggest
[105:54] stacks. We don't want to know who you
[105:56] are. We don't want to know anything
[105:57] about you. So, we're just giving you
[105:59] this email form so you can stay notified
[106:02] about our updates. We also have a PGP
[106:05] key on the website. So, and an email
[106:08] address. So, if you want to send us an
[106:10] encrypted email, this is this company's
[106:13] all about Bitcoiners. We want to know
[106:14] what you like, what you don't like.
[106:17] Don't trust us. Everything we do is
[106:20] going to be verifiable. Everything's
[106:21] going to be open source. We encourage
[106:24] adversarial thinking. If you can poke
[106:26] holes in our designs, please do and and
[106:28] tell us about it. We're all in this
[106:30] together. And uh you know, that's what
[106:32] Vor is all about. [ __ ] right. You
[106:35] guys have time for one more question?
[106:38] Sure.
[106:40] What does hyper Bitcoinization actually
[106:42] look like and mean to you?
[106:46] I mean, for me, hyper Bitcoinization
[106:48] means that Bitcoin is the dominant and
[106:51] primary monetary instrument on Earth.
[106:55] um that fiat currency has been firmly
[106:58] displaced by Bitcoin, that Bitcoin has
[107:02] achieved um all the three categories of
[107:06] money um store value, medium of exchange
[107:10] and unit of account. Everything's priced
[107:13] in Bitcoin and uh you know it it it is
[107:19] become synonymous with money.
[107:23] Yeah. For me, it's pretty much the same
[107:25] of that uh Bitcoin becomes the global
[107:28] currency. Everybody uses it. Uh unit of
[107:31] account, pricing, medium of exchange. Uh
[107:34] and more exciting is that like we've now
[107:37] witnessed profound transformations of
[107:40] the economy. Like I don't I don't think
[107:42] property will have nearly the same
[107:45] influence or affect it once does. Uh I
[107:48] think that the entire module of how
[107:51] people approach economics will be really
[107:54] different. Uh and most exciting is like
[107:57] I think that the world becomes a much
[107:59] more radically free and liberated place.
[108:02] And frankly I believe that uh very
[108:06] similar to how the American ideals that
[108:08] came out of 1776 then pushed out into
[108:11] the world. I think that there's a very
[108:13] similar opportunity for that to happen
[108:16] because Bitcoin is like Bitcoin will not
[108:19] work in a command and control economy
[108:21] like the CCCP runs. It it's simply won't
[108:24] function there. And so I think that
[108:26] there is a very extraordinary
[108:29] opportunity to provide for those that
[108:32] live in the global south an opportunity
[108:35] to have the same sort of Americanstyle
[108:37] revolution through an economic front.
[108:40] And we want Vora to be able to support
[108:43] those individuals in that quest towards
[108:45] their own self-s sovereignty. And we
[108:47] really hope that as the product develops
[108:49] and builds that we will have uh the same
[108:52] thoughtful forward looking solutions for
[108:56] those individuals as we will for
[108:57] Americans as well.
[109:00] Damn right. That's a hell of a note to
[109:02] end on. Guys, I appreciate you both
[109:04] coming on here and talking about this.
[109:06] I'm fascinated by it. Uh, I'm gonna give
[109:10] you a uh an alias email because I I like
[109:13] to create lots of burners. So, you're
[109:15] not you're not getting my real one, you
[109:17] spooks. Uh, but Exactly. That's how you
[109:19] should regard us. So, good. Good. But,
[109:21] uh, seriously, guys, thank you and
[109:23] thanks for thanks for, uh, working on
[109:25] this and building this. Uh, it's one of
[109:27] those things that gives me a lot of hope
[109:28] in the future when I see hardcore state
[109:32] uh disrespecting Bitcoiners building
[109:34] really [ __ ] cool freedom tech that
[109:36] will ultimately allow us all to be more
[109:38] sovereign or move along that spectrum of
[109:40] sovereignty towards an I, you know, a
[109:42] more ideal future. So, thank you guys. I
[109:45] [ __ ] appreciate you both. I'll uh
[109:46] I'll link you both and also I'll link
[109:48] the Vora.io in the description. But
[109:51] yeah, thanks for your time, guys. This
[109:53] was this was a pleasure.
[109:55] Thanks to you as well and the work that
[109:56] you do as well. Yeah, thank you so much
[109:59] for giving us this opportunity to to
[110:01] talk about Vora. Really appreciate it.
[110:03] Me being a podcaster is basically
[110:05] equivalent to advanced cryptography. I
[110:07] mean, it's it's essentially, you know,
[110:08] it's it's it's basically the same thing.
[110:10] Uh, no, appreciate you guys. We're going
[110:13] to cut this now. Thanks to all the uh
[110:14] folks on Noster who joined in the live
[110:16] stream, too. There were more than 25 of
[110:17] you at one point. We got up to like a
[110:19] hundred. So, hey, folks folks on Noster
[110:21] care about [ __ ] That's great to see.
[110:23] All right.
[110:24] I'm going to cut this now, guys. Thank
[110:26] you and cut.
