[00:05] Do you think do you think that Trump
[00:08] understands kind of the highlevel game
[00:10] theory around this like around the first
[00:13] mover advantage? Do you know he may not
[00:15] understand all the nuances of Bitcoin,
[00:17] but do do you think he gets that game
[00:19] theory like or or is it just he's got
[00:21] people in his ear. They're telling him
[00:23] this is what we need to do. You made
[00:24] this promise. Okay, I'll sign it. I'll
[00:25] do it. How how deep do you think that
[00:27] knowledge goes?
[00:29] Well, I would give him some credit that
[00:31] he understands the game theory of it. As
[00:34] for Bitcoin and the implications of
[00:37] everything he's done, I don't think he
[00:38] fully understands it. If you look at the
[00:40] signing of the EO, it's um David Saxs
[00:43] like answering his questions and he's
[00:44] like, you know, did I promise this? You
[00:46] believe in it? You think it's good? I'll
[00:49] sign it. Right? That doesn't sound like
[00:51] a Michael Sailor level of conviction and
[00:53] understanding to me, but I could be
[00:55] wrong. Uh but yeah, I think he
[00:58] definitely does understand there is a a
[01:01] first mover advantage and I definitely
[01:03] think he knows that the goal is to
[01:05] become a Bitcoin superpower because you
[01:08] you want as much of the valuable thing
[01:10] that everyone else wants soon. So that's
[01:14] definitely a given. So that's the I
[01:16] guess that's the answer.
[01:18] Do you uh do you foresee any let's say
[01:23] geopolitical games being played uh
[01:26] between gold and bitcoin as it relates
[01:28] to neutral reserve asset status i.e.
[01:33] Is there any you know is there any bait
[01:35] and switch that happens where okay a lot
[01:38] of foreign central banks have been
[01:39] accumulating gold for some time they
[01:42] haven't been accumulating Bitcoin you
[01:43] know uh who knows how much gold's in
[01:46] Fort Knox uh hopefully most of it we'll
[01:48] see but how do you see that interplay
[01:51] playing out because basically there's
[01:52] two candidates for neutral reserve asset
[01:54] right it's Bitcoin it's you know digital
[01:56] gold or it's analog gold how how do you
[01:58] see that shaking out
[02:01] I think it has a lot to do with
[02:03] how the audits of Fort Knox goes or if
[02:07] there is an audit. If the audit comes
[02:10] back that there's not enough gold, the
[02:12] gold's not all there. I believe we'll
[02:14] see this sort of game play out where
[02:17] gold is demonetized in favor of Bitcoin
[02:19] simply for that reason that you
[02:20] outlined. I think Sailor said the same
[02:22] thing that um you can kind of like take
[02:25] out your enemies that have been buying
[02:26] gold by dumping gold and buying Bitcoin,
[02:29] especially if you have more Bitcoin,
[02:30] right? So, it's just the balance like
[02:32] does the US have more Bitcoin or more
[02:35] gold and do they see the Bitcoin as more
[02:36] valuable or the gold is more valuable?
[02:39] And I think another thing that we forgot
[02:41] to talk about the EO was this will now
[02:44] allow us to actually figure out exactly
[02:46] how much Bitcoin the US has because
[02:48] there's a number that's often thrown out
[02:50] there of 200 to 220,000 Bitcoin. 95,000
[02:54] is going back to
[02:56] Bitfinex and the rest we don't know. the
[02:58] US Marshalss has have kind of said we
[03:00] don't know. So the biggest thing I think
[03:03] for the EO is really that we're going to
[03:05] find out exactly how much they have and
[03:08] that might lead to us finding out how
[03:09] much everyone else has because every
[03:11] number out there is largely an estimate
[03:14] or approximation because China too like
[03:17] right now in in if you're going by
[03:20] general public uh disclosures the US has
[03:23] less than China. China has
[03:25] 194,000. But there are also theories
[03:27] that China sold it because there are
[03:29] some announcements in Chinese news that
[03:31] they disposed of some crypto assets.
[03:33] They didn't say Bitcoin, but they said
[03:35] we will dispose so so much billion
[03:38] dollars of yen uh yen and this much
[03:40] billions of yen and this this department
[03:42] will dispose this much. But we don't
[03:44] know. But if the US comes out and says
[03:47] here's our attestation um you know
[03:49] here's a a signed message from the keys
[03:51] that controls this then I think um other
[03:56] countries will start to need to verify
[03:58] how much they have otherwise you know
[04:02] you don't really believe that at this
[04:03] point trust in government is at an
[04:05] all-time low globally so I think there
[04:08] will be a race for more transparency
[04:09] which is good for everybody
[04:12] that's a really interesting thing to
[04:14] think about because It's also you you
[04:16] can't really do that with gold, you
[04:18] know, but with Bitcoin, it's like, oh,
[04:19] no, it's very easy. We can we'll verify
[04:21] it here for you in, you know, in 5
[04:23] minutes. Like you said, here's the
[04:24] signed message. This is the this is the
[04:26] address. Like, go on, have a look. Uh,
[04:28] you know, check on your own note if you
[04:30] would like. Nothing's, you know,
[04:31] nothing's stopping you. That that's kind
[04:33] of a that's a really radical shift
[04:35] though. I mean, is that one of those
[04:37] things where you think this is one of
[04:38] the ways that let's say the the ethos of
[04:41] Bitcoin, if I can say that, starts
[04:43] bleeding into governments? Like really?
[04:45] I mean, that's radical transparency,
[04:47] right? We're not used to that from
[04:49] governments. Uh, you know, certainly not
[04:51] from any governments recently. Yeah, I I
[04:55] think so because the whole point of this
[04:58] stuff is soft power projection, right?
[05:00] And projection of economic power. um you
[05:03] you kind of want people to know how much
[05:04] gold you have, right? Generally, and
[05:07] like you said, you can't really prove
[05:09] how much gold you have. And we actually
[05:11] don't know. So, this is a very simple,
[05:15] lowcost, highly effective way to prove
[05:17] how much Bitcoin you have. And it's
[05:19] going to be the norm. I think that every
[05:21] country is going to say, "Here's our
[05:22] holdings. You know, look at how powerful
[05:24] we are."
[05:27] Do you think from from another side of
[05:28] this, one of the tropes that folks like,
[05:32] you know, Elizabeth Warren threw out
[05:33] there was, you know, oh, this is going
[05:35] to be used for sanctions evasion uh
[05:38] because and so the effectiveness of US
[05:40] sanctions on countries that get on our
[05:42] bad side is going to be lessened uh by
[05:44] by Bitcoin. And she she's been saying
[05:46] this for years. Is that something that
[05:48] you think is a legitimate concern for,
[05:50] you know, uh policy makers in
[05:52] Washington? Is that something that
[05:53] they're considering or is that just kind
[05:55] of secondary to the fact that this is a
[05:57] as you said about you know soft power
[05:59] projection and holding the only truly
[06:02] finite and verifiable asset on the
[06:04] planet.
[06:05] Yeah. I mean with money being
[06:08] information now because of Bitcoin it's
[06:10] it's really hard to enforce like capital
[06:13] controls are also gone right they've
[06:15] been gone for you know 16 years now with
[06:17] with the dawn of Bitcoin but that's not
[06:20] really talked about. you still pretend
[06:21] that capital controls exist. Um, but are
[06:25] capital controls effective? That's a
[06:27] question you have to ask yourself
[06:28] because there's a lot of um,
[06:30] Chinese-owned real estate in the US.
[06:32] Like, how'd that money get there with
[06:35] the you can only send $50,000 out per
[06:38] year, right, under the current capital
[06:41] control scheme? So, are they that
[06:43] effective? Are sanctions that effective?
[06:45] How how hurt is Russia from being
[06:48] sanctioned to hell? I I don't know. I
[06:51] don't think they're that effective. So,
[06:53] it's a tool I believe that politicians
[06:55] like to wave around and say, "Yeah,
[06:57] we'll sanction you, but does it really
[07:00] work?" I don't think so. So, does it
[07:02] really matter at this point if um you
[07:05] have permissionless money and that
[07:08] reduces the threat of a sanction that
[07:10] doesn't work? You have to draw your own
[07:13] conclusion from that.
[07:15] I'm curious too, you know, okay, let's
[07:18] say uh, you know, governments start to
[07:21] get behind this. The US already is
[07:23] obviously to a certain extent with this
[07:25] EO and these other, uh, these other
[07:27] draft bits of legislation that have
[07:28] been, uh, submitted again. Do you think
[07:31] we see central bank push back? Do you
[07:33] think we see you know uh folks like you
[07:36] know not just the United States Federal
[07:38] Reserve but other uh kind of US
[07:40] controlled institutions like the IMF
[07:42] like the World Bank uh you know I mean
[07:44] even the BIS for you know the Bank of Do
[07:48] you think these they have not been big
[07:50] friends to Bitcoin in the past are they
[07:52] going to view this as kind of an
[07:53] acceleration of the threat? How do you
[07:55] think like how do you think that plays
[07:57] out? All of those institutions are
[08:01] definitely going to fight back because
[08:02] you're cutting off their livelihood,
[08:04] right? Like they are sort of like
[08:06] central banks. They can print their own
[08:08] money. The IMF with the uh special
[08:10] drawing rights, right? That's basically
[08:12] printed money. So like when we talk
[08:14] about money printing, it's not just like
[08:16] physical printing of bills. Like all of
[08:18] this is printing of money, right? It's
[08:19] increasing the money supply everywhere.
[08:22] And yeah, it's it's their you're you're
[08:25] cutting off their job, so they're going
[08:26] to hate it really. So, I don't really
[08:30] see any way around that. You know, you
[08:31] have these institutions that are very
[08:33] entrenched, very influential and
[08:36] powerful and you're kind of chopping off
[08:40] their ability to do what they do. So,
[08:43] they're going to fight it until the end.
[08:46] But, you know, if it's if you're talking
[08:48] about just central banks, I think there
[08:50] really has to be a moment of reckoning
[08:53] where you you ask the people there like,
[08:56] are you thinking about this for your own
[08:58] benefit or for the benefit of the
[09:01] country and if it is for the benefit of
[09:03] the country, they have to acknowledge
[09:05] that they need Bitcoin and they should
[09:07] just hold Bitcoin. they can still exist
[09:10] and just, you know, do whatever they
[09:12] want to do, but, you know, they should
[09:14] hold Bitcoin, right, and pretend to
[09:16] manage monetary policy and inflation.
[09:18] But for the other ones like the IMF and
[09:20] World Bank, I think it's a much more
[09:22] difficult battle because they're not
[09:23] really accountable to anybody, right?
[09:26] It's like a a collective group that
[09:28] funds them and they're they have no
[09:30] accountability whatsoever.
