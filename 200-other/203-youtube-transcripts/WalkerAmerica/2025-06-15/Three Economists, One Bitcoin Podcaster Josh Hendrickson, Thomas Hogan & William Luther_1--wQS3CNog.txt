[00:00] If the government has this big new
[00:02] revenue source, right, that return on on
[00:04] Bitcoin, does it use it to pay down its
[00:07] debt to be more fiscally responsible?
[00:10] Well, it's not being fiscally
[00:12] responsible with its current budget. So,
[00:15] why would we expect it to be fiscally
[00:17] responsible with a bigger budget, right?
[00:20] And so, we can set this entire
[00:22] conversation about what the expected
[00:25] return on Bitcoin is aside. We still
[00:28] have to find some mechanism to get the
[00:31] government to be fiscally responsible.
[00:34] If we don't do that, it doesn't matter
[00:36] what the return on these assets are. The
[00:38] government's going to spend it all and
[00:39] then some. So, I think that's, you know,
[00:42] a difficult nut to crack. There's pretty
[00:43] much every model of fiat money that we
[00:46] have in economics has two equilibrium.
[00:48] So, there's an equilibrium where the
[00:50] fiat money has positive value and
[00:52] there's an equilibrium where fiat money
[00:54] has zero value. And what we call the
[00:57] transition from that positive value
[00:59] equilibrium to the zero value
[01:00] equilibrium is hyperinflation, right?
[01:03] Yeah. That it's funny that that spending
[01:04] issue with Bitcoin is the same same
[01:06] thing is true for inflation, you know.
[01:08] So if the if the government's holding
[01:10] Bitcoin and they think, well, you know,
[01:12] now we have this valuable asset, so our
[01:14] debt's not as bad. We can spend a little
[01:16] more. And the same thing is true with
[01:18] inflation. They're like, well,
[01:19] inflation's terrible, but it's at least
[01:21] it's pushing up the value of our
[01:22] Bitcoin.
[01:24] [Music]
[01:29] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:32] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:34] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:37] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:40] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:42] Bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:44] right now, remember you are still early.

[02:16] Without further ado, let's get into this
[02:19] Bitcoin talk.
[02:26] [Music]
[02:27] three economists on one podcast. This is
[02:31] uh the most economists I've ever had in
[02:33] the same digital room at once. So, uh
[02:35] William, Thomas, Josh, welcome. Thank
[02:37] you guys for joining me. I am very
[02:39] excited to talk to you all. Thanks.
[02:42] Happy to be here. So, you may find out
[02:43] that it's uh it's three economists too
[02:46] many.
[02:48] That's a possibility. Don't be so hard
[02:50] on yourselves. Uh no, you know, I mean,
[02:53] if if you guys were all uh you know,
[02:55] fiat Keynesian economists, that might be
[02:57] true, but I think in this case, uh that
[02:59] would not be a fair label to uh to put
[03:02] on any of you. Um I I am super curious
[03:05] just to to set the stage for folks who
[03:07] may not know you all. Can we uh just do
[03:09] like a a little kind of round the horn
[03:11] and uh if you guys don't mind just
[03:13] introducing yourselves uh just who you
[03:15] are, where you're where you're teaching
[03:17] at. You are all fellows at senior
[03:19] fellows at the Bitcoin policy institute.
[03:21] Um and you guys are uh the institute is
[03:24] doing great work uh vibe shifting our
[03:26] nation towards Bitcoin which is amazing
[03:29] but just kind of love to know a little
[03:30] bit about your backgrounds and maybe
[03:32] kind of uh how you became an economist
[03:35] who was also into Bitcoin and maybe
[03:37] William if you want to start us off.
[03:39] Sure. My name is William Luther. I'm an
[03:41] associate professor at Florida Atlantic
[03:43] University and uh I direct the Sound
[03:45] Money Project at the American Institute
[03:47] for Economic Research. Um I guess you
[03:50] know the the I first heard about Bitcoin
[03:54] back in 2010. Um my uh my graduate
[03:58] adviser Larry White is um what you might
[04:01] call a proto Bitcoiner. So back in the
[04:04] '9s, uh, Larry White and his and his
[04:07] first student, George Seljen, were were
[04:10] having these debates with folks like Hal
[04:12] Finny and Nick Sabo about digital
[04:15] monies. So when when Bitcoin came along,
[04:19] um, you know, this they were already on
[04:20] the mailing lists, they were already um,
[04:23] you know, in those conversations. Um so
[04:26] it was just a a very natural thing for
[04:28] our our working group to be uh thinking
[04:31] about and talking about and um sure
[04:34] enough one of my colleagues uh um
[04:36] presented a paper on Bitcoin and um uh
[04:39] you know it just goes from there. I
[04:41] guess that that is I I was not expecting
[04:44] you to have uh heard about it that
[04:46] early. So that's I mean quite really the
[04:49] bleeding edge there.
[04:52] Yeah. you know, um you Thomas Thomas was
[04:54] in the same working group actually. Um
[04:57] and when when Thomas finished his PhD,
[05:00] he gifted our adviser some Bitcoin. Wow.
[05:04] So early days uh uh in the in the
[05:07] Bitcoin community. And Thomas, maybe if
[05:10] you want to go next. Yeah, that's right.
[05:13] We we traded some Bitcoin in 20 2010 or
[05:16] 2011, but strictly for research purposes
[05:19] naturally. Naturally. Yeah. So So I'm
[05:21] Thomas Hogan. I'm a professor of
[05:22] economics at the University of Austin.
[05:25] Not the University of Texas at Austin.
[05:26] We are a brand new university, the
[05:28] University of Austin, um with a brand
[05:32] new group of freshmen, our first ever
[05:33] set of students. So, I'm excited to be
[05:36] founding this new university. Um I
[05:38] previously worked at Rice University and
[05:40] a few others and I was formerly the
[05:42] chief economist of the US Senate
[05:44] Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban
[05:45] Affairs. Um, I do research on financial
[05:48] regulation and monetary economics. And
[05:50] as Will mentioned, when we were in grad
[05:52] school, uh, we were talking about
[05:54] Bitcoin in 2010 and 2011. And part of
[05:58] that was that, um, we were doing
[06:00] research on, um, how money works outside
[06:03] of the government. What did we have
[06:05] before we had the Federal Reserve and
[06:07] this new idea, Bitcoin? Was this going
[06:09] to be a new money? Was it going to be
[06:11] the first experiment in non-governmental
[06:13] money that we'd had in a hundred years?
[06:15] And so it was a pretty exciting topic
[06:18] for us. Um, and Will ended up doing a
[06:20] lot of research on it. And Josh and Will
[06:22] and I have worked together on some um,
[06:25] Bitcoin related research. And now we're
[06:27] all uh, fellows at the Bitcoin Policy
[06:29] Institute trying to uh, advise and
[06:32] influence uh, government policy related
[06:34] to Bitcoin.
[06:36] I I I want to give Josh a a chance here
[06:39] too, but I want to just put a pin in
[06:40] that and remember to circle back because
[06:42] I'm very curious of what the kind of
[06:44] takeaways of your research uh and your
[06:45] thesis at that time was and if that's
[06:47] evolved at all. Uh but Josh, maybe if
[06:50] you want to uh give yourself an
[06:51] introduction, too. Yeah, so I'm Josh
[06:53] Hendrickson. I'm the I'm a professor in
[06:55] the chair of the economics department at
[06:56] the University of Mississippi.
[06:59] Um I guess I found out about Bitcoin in
[07:02] 2011.
[07:04] Um the so I was finishing up graduate
[07:08] school and kind of the focus of my
[07:11] research had really been on monetary
[07:14] policy but what I was really focused on
[07:16] was typically when economists talk about
[07:20] like policy they're talking about
[07:24] um hey like there's some kind of market
[07:26] failure and so like the the you know the
[07:29] government steps in and then they
[07:30] actually just kind of replicate what a
[07:32] market would do kind of thing. But what
[07:35] I kind of noticed is that when it came
[07:36] to monetary policy, a lot of people were
[07:38] not talking that way about policy. And
[07:40] so one of my interests was kind of um
[07:45] okay, suppose you're stuck with the
[07:47] Federal
[07:48] Reserve, what should the Federal Reserve
[07:50] do that would replicate what a
[07:52] market-based system would do? And so
[07:53] that got really got me into thinking
[07:55] about alternative monetary regimes and
[07:58] things like that. So, I was kind of
[07:59] reading um all of that stuff and so I
[08:03] heard a podcast in 2011 about Bitcoin
[08:06] and there were just a lot of themes in
[08:08] the podcast where they were just
[08:09] describing how it was designed. Um and I
[08:13] I recognized those themes uh you know
[08:16] like and and how similar that some of
[08:19] the stuff was to like Larry and and
[08:21] George's work um which I knew and also
[08:23] to to a guy named Ben Klein's work. And
[08:25] so um so it just kind of fascinated me
[08:27] and I kind of thought okay
[08:30] um I mean in 2011 I thought okay this is
[08:32] probably not going to this you know this
[08:35] is probably not going to go anywhere.
[08:36] it's probably not going to be
[08:37] successful, but you know, maybe um
[08:40] there'll be a period where it it gains
[08:42] some popularity or success and then we
[08:45] can kind of learn from from that. And
[08:46] but but from my perspective, it was
[08:48] like, well, as an economist, this is a
[08:50] fascinating thing to study because no
[08:52] matter what happens, whether it succeeds
[08:53] or whether it fails or whether it's
[08:55] somewhere in between, um it will teach
[08:57] us something about what we really know
[09:00] about monetary economics. And so from my
[09:02] perspective, it was like, well, this is
[09:03] something that's worthwhile to study
[09:05] regardless of what what happens to it.
[09:09] First of all, I'm already fascinated
[09:10] because you guys have been aware of
[09:12] Bitcoin for a a very long time. And I
[09:15] think that people often don't think of
[09:17] folks in the uh I think economics has
[09:19] perhaps gotten a very bad rap because of
[09:22] uh you know maybe it's folks like Paul
[09:24] Krugman uh who are you know very
[09:26] famously uh you know economists and very
[09:28] famously bad on Bitcoin uh but you guys
[09:32] have been tuned into this for such a
[09:34] long time. I'm curious just uh Thomas
[09:36] kind of going back to your initial uh
[09:39] graduate thesis there. Uh what was it
[09:42] and and did you you know does it still
[09:45] hold uh hold up today as you're thinking
[09:47] on Bitcoin as a alternative to you know
[09:51] centrally controlled money? Has it
[09:53] evolved significantly since then? Well,
[09:55] it certainly made a lot more progress
[09:57] than I expected. You know, early on it
[09:59] seemed like Bitcoin was potentially just
[10:01] going to be sort of a niche thing. Um
[10:03] and and a lot of the debate was, you
[10:06] know, is this money? Should we consider
[10:07] it to be money? Um at what point does it
[10:10] gain enough users that we think of it as
[10:12] money? And certainly within some small
[10:14] community, you could have people trading
[10:16] it and it would be at least money to
[10:18] them. But I think we we didn't really
[10:19] think it was going to do anything uh
[10:22] that would rival the US dollar or become
[10:24] a major reserve. And you know, it
[10:26] certainly seems like now that's that's
[10:28] uh becoming pretty serious. And so it's
[10:30] it's made a lot more progress on on that
[10:32] front than we expected. Um, but also I
[10:35] think the reliance on it, the the
[10:39] community of Bitcoiners that have all um
[10:43] rallied around Bitcoin and made sure
[10:45] that there's no uh attempts to change
[10:48] the issuance or no fundamental changes
[10:50] to the protocol um really gives it a
[10:53] sort of reputation and uh reliability
[10:56] that you know the other cryptocurrencies
[10:58] just don't have anything like that. And
[11:01] then with with that community, you it
[11:04] really puts a lot more trust uh in
[11:06] Bitcoin and and that's something that,
[11:08] you know, we didn't know was going to
[11:09] happen at the time. Um that I think is a
[11:12] lot better. And so now with major
[11:14] institutions, with some governments
[11:15] adopting it, um it's even more solid
[11:18] foundation than it's had before. Um and
[11:21] that's something I like we could have we
[11:22] could have guessed, but I definitely did
[11:24] not expect uh when we were talking about
[11:26] it in 2010 2011.
[11:29] William, I'm curious to hear from you as
[11:31] well. Was that uh does that mirror your
[11:33] experience and kind of uh has Bitcoin
[11:36] exceeded expectations, let's say? Yeah,
[11:39] certainly. And and you know, in just in
[11:41] terms of the the narrow monetary
[11:44] economics, Bitcoin has has uh changed or
[11:49] um maybe modified my thinking on on some
[11:52] important questions. So, for example, um
[11:55] you know, there isn't there isn't a lot
[11:57] of work in economics about launching new
[12:00] monies. Um, for some reason, it just
[12:03] doesn't seem to be a question that many
[12:04] economists have been all that interested
[12:06] in. Um, but prior to Bitcoin, I would
[12:10] say the the the best work, certainly the
[12:12] best work that I had read on the topic
[12:14] was was by George Seljian. And George
[12:17] put this view forward, which you might
[12:19] think of as being in the Austrian
[12:21] tradition. He links the argument to to
[12:24] Ludwick Van Misa's regression theorem.
[12:27] And the argument is basically that if
[12:30] you if you have an item that you want to
[12:34] introduce as money, that item is either
[12:37] something that's already being used for
[12:39] other purposes, which we would call a
[12:40] commodity, or it's what economists would
[12:43] call an intrinsically worthless item.
[12:45] That is it might play some role as a
[12:48] medium of exchange if people will accept
[12:50] it but it doesn't have any nonmonetary
[12:52] value. It doesn't have any use apart
[12:55] from any role it might play as a a
[12:57] medium of exchange. And George's
[13:00] argument again drawing on on Mises's
[13:03] earlier work was that the way we got
[13:07] fiat monies was that initially you had
[13:11] commodity monies circulating and then
[13:14] some government steps in and removes the
[13:17] redemption for the underlying commodity.
[13:19] So you have some commodity like gold
[13:22] coins that's emerged. um maybe banks or
[13:25] a central bank issues some paper claims
[13:28] on those gold coins that are redeemable
[13:32] um and then that redemption gets removed
[13:34] and so in that case people are already
[13:37] using the paper notes um when it becomes
[13:41] a fiat money. So you haven't really
[13:44] launched a fiat money. George indicates
[13:47] uh he he he points to another way that
[13:50] you can launch fiat monies and this is
[13:53] you know for example with a country like
[13:54] the with a a currency like the the euro
[13:59] right in that case you have these
[14:00] national currencies that are already
[14:02] circulating. So first you establish a
[14:05] fixed exchange rate between this new
[14:08] money the euro and the monies that are
[14:10] already circulating. By the way, a fixed
[14:12] exchange rate that is backed by um or or
[14:16] at least supported by maybe to be a more
[14:18] precise supported by governments, right?
[14:20] They're committed to uh maintaining that
[14:23] fixed exchange rate. And then it's only
[14:25] after the euro begins circulating that
[14:28] that fixed exchange rate is removed. So
[14:31] that that
[14:34] background raises some questions about
[14:36] how how Bitcoin gets off the ground,
[14:39] right? some questions that I was um
[14:41] grappling with in some of my earlier
[14:43] research. You know, Bitcoin, it's not a
[14:46] commodity in in you know, when it's
[14:49] first introduced, nobody is is using it
[14:52] for for anything, right? Um and so if
[14:55] you're trying to you know, if you're
[14:57] trying to purchase a pizza with some
[14:58] Bitcoin, you're basically asking someone
[15:01] to give you something of value for
[15:04] something that nobody else has any use
[15:07] for at the time, right? an intrinsically
[15:09] worthless item. At the same time, you
[15:12] don't really have a government that is
[15:14] supporting a fixed exchange rate. Um, so
[15:18] there was this idea that these
[15:20] non-government intrinsically worthless
[15:23] items just couldn't get off the ground
[15:25] that they they they suffered from this
[15:29] um this problem similar to the the you
[15:32] know the uh uh mechanism in Misus's
[15:35] regression theorem where since nobody
[15:38] accepts them at the outset nobody has an
[15:41] incentive to accept them therefore
[15:43] nobody ends up accepting them. And what
[15:46] I what I came to appreciate a bit more
[15:49] is the role of coordination. If you go
[15:52] back and look at the early Bitcoin
[15:54] community, they were they were aware of
[15:56] this sort of stuff, right? Hal Finny was
[15:58] a very smart guy. He's citing George
[16:01] Seljin on the forums, right? He
[16:04] understood monetary economics. Um, and
[16:08] they knew that you had to you had to
[16:11] coordinate, right? you had to establish
[16:14] some some baseline value for this thing
[16:17] in order to get it going. But then once
[16:20] you get it going, it can, you know,
[16:22] other people can accept it because it's
[16:24] no longer a worthless item. So this this
[16:27] both the role of coordination and
[16:28] establishing some initial value and the
[16:32] idea that this threshold between zero
[16:35] and positive is just much smaller than I
[16:38] thought about pre than I thought it was
[16:40] previously. I think it was certainly in
[16:42] George's earlier work, it was seen as
[16:44] this you this insurmountable hurdle just
[16:48] couldn't be done or was extremely
[16:49] unlikely. But you don't have to go from
[16:52] from a totally worthless item to
[16:55] something that's very valuable uh in
[16:57] that first transaction. You can move in
[17:00] very small increments and gradually get
[17:02] to something that's a more valuable
[17:04] item. So I would say that's probably the
[17:06] thing um the idea that's that's changed
[17:09] the most. Um, in thinking about Bitcoin
[17:12] for me, well, it's it's kind of a it's a
[17:15] a bit of a paradigm shifting moment, I
[17:18] think, because obviously before Bitcoin,
[17:20] there there wasn't something that had
[17:22] done this. I mean, correct me if I'm
[17:24] wrong here, but I don't know if there's
[17:26] there's never been anything like
[17:27] Bitcoin. And certainly I mean there were
[17:29] other attempts obviously at digital
[17:30] currency that failed for whatever reason
[17:33] whether that be the they were centrally
[17:35] controlled and the government you know
[17:37] stepped in uh or for whatever other
[17:39] reason but we haven't seen something
[17:42] like Bitcoin before and I mean I think
[17:44] that's you know it's very easy to get
[17:45] frustrated with people who even still in
[17:47] the year 2025 you know aren't grocking
[17:50] Bitcoin but then you take a step back
[17:52] and you realize well okay I can't
[17:54] entirely blame them. uh the media hasn't
[17:56] done them any favors in trying to
[17:57] understand it. Uh they've been fed uh
[17:59] you know a lot of uh a lot of garbage in
[18:02] terms of the information that's
[18:03] available and also we just have never
[18:05] seen anything like this before like this
[18:07] is a a fundamental shift and I'm you
[18:11] know I'm kind of cur curious where you
[18:12] guys see like is there ever any going
[18:15] back from this? Like I I'm of the
[18:17] opinion you know I think that uh the
[18:19] chances that Bitcoin fails at this point
[18:22] are extremely extremely low. I think
[18:25] that it's permeated enough of uh of the
[18:28] world and of uh our economic systems and
[18:31] of our collective thought that you're
[18:34] going to have a very hard time killing
[18:35] Bitcoin off. That said, I mean, does the
[18:39] genie ever go back in the bottle? Like,
[18:41] now that we know that this can be done,
[18:43] is there ever any return? like will
[18:46] governments ever be able to, you know,
[18:48] to to do these kind of fiat bait and
[18:50] switches that you talked about where
[18:52] it's like they never really launched a
[18:54] fiat currency from from nothing. They
[18:56] had other means by which they did it.
[18:58] Subtle rug pulls of of exchange rates
[19:00] with either other currencies or
[19:02] commodity monies. Can they ever get away
[19:05] with doing that again as we go into the
[19:07] future now that Bitcoin exists and has
[19:10] proven that you can go, you know, the
[19:11] free market can determine the price of
[19:13] money?
[19:15] Well, we should never underestimate the
[19:17] government's ability to engage in a
[19:20] rugpool. Fair enough. Fair enough. You
[19:22] know, we have to we have to remember
[19:23] that those governments, they employ an
[19:26] army of people, and I mean a literal
[19:28] army of people um with, you know, uh
[19:32] guns and tanks and bombs. Uh they can do
[19:36] things. they can
[19:39] persuade, strongarm people into doing
[19:42] things that you or I and and ordinary
[19:45] market participants just can't. Um so so
[19:50] certainly the the world is different
[19:51] now. People have an exit that they
[19:54] didn't have in the past. Um but the
[19:56] government is still a force to be
[19:58] reckoned with, right? Um and and many
[20:02] governments around the world uh do not
[20:04] hesitate to to use that force for their
[20:07] own ends.
[20:10] Yeah. I mean for the three of us, our
[20:12] early work on Bitcoin was really about
[20:15] how will governments try to stop this? I
[20:18] mean that's that's really what it was.
[20:19] And so if we're talking about how things
[20:21] have changed and what what happened that
[20:23] was unexpected is
[20:25] um you know our working assumption from
[20:28] the beginning was always you know what
[20:30] are the things that governments can do
[20:31] to stop this from happening and then you
[20:34] know you fast forward a few years later
[20:36] and you've got the Bitcoin conference
[20:38] and you've got RFK Jr. and Donald Trump
[20:41] running for president saying oh we're
[20:42] going to buy Bitcoin and we're going to
[20:44] hold it you know on our balance sheet
[20:46] and things like that. And so I think
[20:48] that's kind of the biggest surprise. But
[20:49] I do think that there's a lesson here
[20:51] though that's important which is if you
[20:53] look at the history um of all of these
[20:56] things. I mean we do have to be um
[20:58] careful here, right? Because
[21:01] um yes it is a lot better um when you
[21:05] have uh governments who who are not you
[21:07] know actively like trying to stop you
[21:09] from from using this but at the same
[21:11] time you have to recognize that there
[21:13] are other risks that are associated with
[21:15] their support. Right? So conceivably the
[21:17] government is going to want to use this
[21:19] for their own uh purposes. Um and
[21:22] they're they're going to try to figure
[21:24] out ways to to manipulate things. I mean
[21:26] even if you go back um you know you'll
[21:29] often hear people say things like oh
[21:31] well like the the gold standard was a
[21:33] constraint on on government's you know
[21:36] um ability to spend and borrow and
[21:38] things like that. Um but that's that's
[21:41] um that that's false. And the reason
[21:43] it's false is that a lot of um central
[21:46] banks on, you know, once you had central
[21:48] banks on the gold standard, they figured
[21:50] out this really neat way to pay for
[21:52] wars, which was you go to war and you
[21:53] suspend the convertability of your
[21:55] currency into gold. And then when the
[21:57] war is over, you just restore the
[21:58] convertability and you go and you go
[22:00] back to normal. And so, uh, doing that
[22:03] allowed you a lot of borrowing capacity.
[22:05] It allowed you a lot of capacity to to
[22:07] print money during the during the war.
[22:10] Um, and yes, it it it also led to sort
[22:12] of um, you know, costly recessions after
[22:16] the war because you're because you got
[22:17] to go back on the gold standard. But the
[22:20] point was is that they figured out uh,
[22:22] how to manipulate that system to their
[22:24] advantage. And so I do think that we
[22:26] always need to have that in the backs of
[22:27] our minds about you know when we're
[22:29] thinking about government support is
[22:30] that government support um for this
[22:33] technology is not um you know it it's
[22:36] not necessarily
[22:38] um a universal good just because they're
[22:40] they're supportive of it. They're going
[22:42] to want to use it in the ways that um
[22:44] are are going to allow them to achieve
[22:45] the goals that they're trying to
[22:47] achieve. If you're stuck spending
[22:49] dollars at least stop earning dirty fiat

[26:03] Yeah. I I would also say, you know, part
[26:05] of the question if we're if we're asking
[26:07] could they put the genie back in the
[26:08] bottle, are we ever going back? Um well,
[26:11] it depends on where are we going, right?
[26:13] Like what what do we think is is the
[26:15] outcome here when governments are
[26:16] starting to hold Bitcoin as as reserves?
[26:19] You know, what does that really mean?
[26:21] Are they going to start allowing uh
[26:23] people to use that as money? Are they
[26:24] themselves going to use that as money?
[26:26] Are they going to make their own
[26:27] currencies redeemable for Bitcoin? Um,
[26:30] you know, I think some Bitcoiners think
[26:32] we're we're headed for hyper
[26:34] bitcoinization. Um, I had I had Parker
[26:37] Lewis and Will Cole speaking by Bitcoin
[26:39] class about a week ago and they were
[26:41] saying, you know, within five years or I
[26:43] don't I I don't want to put words in
[26:44] their mouth, but I'm sure they say stuff
[26:46] like this. It's like, you know, they're
[26:47] very soon they believe, look,
[26:49] everything's going to be priced in
[26:50] Bitcoin. Governments are going to have
[26:52] no choice but to start using that as
[26:54] money. You know, I'm not so sure about
[26:56] that. So, I I think that it depends a
[26:59] lot on which government we're talking
[27:00] about. You know, the the United States
[27:02] uh Federal Reserve, as much as we hate
[27:05] it, is better than most other central
[27:07] banks around the world. And as much as
[27:09] we love Bitcoin and the advantages it
[27:11] brings, a lot of Americans just don't
[27:13] care very much. You know, they're happy
[27:15] to keep on using dollars. And I think
[27:17] that'll change, but I'm not sure it's
[27:18] going to change the entire monetary
[27:20] system of the United States, whereas in
[27:22] other countries, Bitcoin's a much bigger
[27:24] advantage, right? And so I I could see a
[27:27] lot more adoption of Bitcoin both by
[27:29] individuals instead of their local
[27:32] currencies, but even but also by
[27:33] governments in other countries that just
[27:35] don't have reliable banking systems. So
[27:37] does that make those governments and and
[27:39] our government more or less likely to
[27:42] try to interfere with Bitcoin? You know,
[27:44] I don't know. Certainly, I think
[27:45] governments are going to try to use the
[27:46] monetary system to their advantage as
[27:48] much as they can. um if the United
[27:51] States is not reliant on Bitcoin but
[27:53] holds reserves, you know, maybe they
[27:55] have some ability to manipulate that. Um
[27:59] but also maybe if they see other
[28:01] countries that are in some sense are
[28:03] enemies, you know, maybe if other
[28:05] countries are using Bitcoin and and
[28:07] Americans are still using dollars and a
[28:09] lot of people around the world are using
[28:10] dollars, you know, maybe some
[28:12] governments, including our own, would
[28:14] still be trying to manipulate Bitcoin.
[28:16] And so, you know, I do I worry it it's
[28:19] funny like for all of us our main worry
[28:21] is the government screwing it up again,
[28:24] right? Just just in different ways. And
[28:25] so we're, you know, we think about all
[28:27] these different ways ways that it could
[28:29] happen. Um, and so I like I think in in
[28:33] the current scenario where people are
[28:35] starting to adopt it more, where it's
[28:37] proving to be a more reliable currency
[28:39] and and being more adopted for
[28:41] transactions by, you know, people in a
[28:43] lot of countries, I think we will see
[28:46] some switch over to that. But like right
[28:48] now, I think governments basically are
[28:50] just going to try to hold it as
[28:51] reserves. Um, and hopefully hopefully
[28:54] they won't have a big incentive to try
[28:57] to interfere with the the system.
[29:01] I guess one would hope that the game
[29:03] theory of Bitcoin is sound enough that
[29:05] it does not it is not in any uh if a
[29:07] government is holding a lot of Bitcoin,
[29:09] it's not in their interest to mess with
[29:11] Bitcoin because they potentially are
[29:14] going to decrease the value of that
[29:15] thing they hold a lot of. Like, you
[29:16] know, you want Bitcoin to kind of keep
[29:18] doing its thing. If you mess with it and
[29:20] you hold a lot of it, well, I mean,
[29:21] unless you're just trying to, you know,
[29:22] burn it all down around you, I guess
[29:24] that's a different strategy. Yeah. Well,
[29:25] I mean, that's why forks exist, too,
[29:27] right? Yeah. I mean, we right we'd like
[29:29] for that to be the case. And I think in
[29:30] general, you're you're exactly right for
[29:32] any for any large group of of or any
[29:36] individual that holds a lot of Bitcoin.
[29:38] That's certainly the case is like you
[29:39] don't want to mess it up because it
[29:41] hurts you if you do that. Um, but
[29:43] sometimes governments don't care, right?
[29:45] If if uh the United States saw that
[29:47] China were using a lot of Bitcoin um and
[29:50] even if our own government um was
[29:52] holding a lot of reserves, they might be
[29:54] willing to destroy those reserves or
[29:56] harm themselves in some way if it harmed
[29:58] China more, right? But um but I I hope
[30:01] that they wouldn't do that and I I think
[30:03] like right now I don't think that
[30:04] they'll have the incentive to do that
[30:06] and we just need to see over the next 5
[30:08] years or a decade how it plays out and
[30:10] what countries start using this and are
[30:12] they sort of passively involved whereas
[30:15] individuals are just using it more for
[30:17] monetary transactions. Um then hopefully
[30:19] the government won't have the big
[30:21] incentive to interfere.
[30:23] But we don't even we don't even have to
[30:24] look at hypotheticals here, right? Like
[30:26] we have we have some relevant history.
[30:29] Uh the US used to be on a gold standard.
[30:31] Um that was a uh you know at least
[30:34] initially a market-based money and what
[30:36] did governments do with that gold
[30:38] standard? Well, first they undermined
[30:40] the supply mechanism, right? They had
[30:42] their own issuance on top of that gold
[30:45] standard. They would uh you know hoard
[30:47] the supply and so the you know
[30:49] essentially that's like you know there
[30:51] being less gold in the world or um
[30:54] release that supply, right? They could
[30:56] they could um uh you know play around
[30:59] with the circulating supply even if um
[31:02] you know the actual uh supply is is
[31:05] determined by by gold mining and then
[31:08] you know they issued so many redeemable
[31:10] claims on those you know the US wasn't
[31:12] able to honor its redemption pledges.
[31:15] It's you know suspended temporarily we
[31:18] were assured in 1971
[31:21] uh just a temporary measure. Nixon
[31:23] promised us we were going to return to
[31:24] the gold standard. Um but here we are
[31:28] 2025, no return in sight. So, you know,
[31:32] this this idea that like maybe the
[31:34] government would mismanage
[31:36] um some some market-based money, uh it's
[31:39] not just a hypothetical, right? It's
[31:41] it's a historical reality. Like that's
[31:43] actually what the US government did. So,
[31:47] um certainly not a concern we should we
[31:49] should take lightly.
[31:51] I'm curious what you guys think just
[31:53] speaking of gold as well. Uh obviously
[31:55] gold does have a proven track record as
[31:58] a neutral reserve currency. It's been
[32:00] money for thousands of years. Uh it's
[32:02] it's done, you know, it's done pretty
[32:04] well as money for a for a shiny piece of
[32:06] metal. Like it's really held its own. Um
[32:09] it does not function so well in the
[32:12] digital era where information can travel
[32:14] at the speed of light uh around the
[32:17] world. You know, it's everything is real
[32:19] time now. Gold is not a a real-time
[32:22] settlement mechanism, at least not uh
[32:24] not to physically transact it and not to
[32:26] actually change the custody of it. Uh it
[32:29] requires quite a lot of uh quite a lot
[32:31] of work to keep that gold safe versus a
[32:33] you know $50 hardware wallet that you
[32:36] can use to secure some Bitcoin. But I'm
[32:38] curious, I mean, we've obviously seen
[32:40] central banks around the world looks
[32:43] like they're making some moves in terms
[32:44] of trying to accumulate more gold. I
[32:46] mean, China and Russia have been doing
[32:47] this for for a while. the US. I'm not
[32:49] sure how much gold we really have in
[32:50] Fort Knox. I think that's perhaps up for
[32:52] up for debate. But I mean, do you think
[32:56] that where we're at right now, uh, you
[32:59] know, Thomas, you were saying you don't
[33:00] think this hyper bitcoinization is as
[33:02] close as uh some some Bitcoiners would
[33:04] uh lead you to believe, do you think
[33:06] that we're more positioned right now for
[33:08] return to gold as a, you know, neutral
[33:11] reserve asset? Uh, or is Bitcoin uh does
[33:15] Bitcoin actually have a shot at this in
[33:17] the near term? or do we need to watch
[33:18] gold fail again as a neutral reserve
[33:21] asset before Bitcoin comes in? Yeah,
[33:23] that that's a great question. I think so
[33:25] one thing I would say first is you know
[33:27] the the situation with gold right now is
[33:30] a lot different than when we were on a
[33:31] gold standard. You know when we were on
[33:33] the gold standard for most of US history
[33:35] we had a very stable price level except
[33:37] for as Josh mentioned when we had a
[33:40] couple of major wars and they suspended
[33:41] the gold standard but other than that
[33:43] very very stable long run price level.
[33:45] Right now, we see a lot of fluctuations
[33:47] in in gold because we don't have a
[33:50] stable price level because we're not on
[33:51] a gold standard, right? And so, if we
[33:53] went back to that, we might move back to
[33:55] a more stable standard. And there there
[33:58] are people that would like to see that.
[34:00] You know, we went off the gold standard
[34:01] on an executive order by FDR in 1933.
[34:05] And people are arguing, look, we could
[34:06] go right back on it. Trump could come
[34:08] out tonight and say, "As of tomorrow or
[34:12] uh you know, Monday or whenever, we're
[34:14] back on a gold standard. All of your
[34:16] dollars are redeemable for gold." And as
[34:18] you mentioned, like if we've got the
[34:19] gold in Fort Knox, then potentially
[34:21] we've got enough gold to handle that
[34:22] kind of a system. Um would that be good?
[34:25] I I I don't know. I I think um there are
[34:29] a couple of problems. like one is that
[34:31] it it would provide some constraint, but
[34:34] as Josh mentioned, it's not a total
[34:36] constraint if we still have a central
[34:37] bank that's going to be managing it. Um,
[34:39] it wouldn't be quite as good as the
[34:41] previous gold standard because we
[34:43] wouldn't be on an international gold
[34:44] system that would enable uh exchange.
[34:47] And also, it depends a lot on what
[34:49] people expect. If they don't believe
[34:52] that we're credibly on the gold standard
[34:54] for the long run, then they're just not
[34:56] going to believe that it's going to be a
[34:57] stable system. And so we won't have that
[34:59] that same benefit. You know, I tend to
[35:02] think that a better plan might just be
[35:04] tell people to use whatever they want.
[35:06] You know, make money the choice of money
[35:08] free and if people want to use gold,
[35:10] they can use gold. If people want to use
[35:11] Bitcoin, they can use Bitcoin. Um, you
[35:14] know, Will mentioned our our adviser
[35:16] Larry White's got this great book, Gold,
[35:18] Fiat, or Bitcoin. Better money, gold,
[35:19] fiat or Bitcoin, where he compares
[35:22] these. Um, and I think Larry believes
[35:24] that if people had the choice, they
[35:25] would switch back to a gold standard.
[35:27] And his argument is kind of like you
[35:28] mentioned that look, countries all over
[35:31] the world adopted gold. Like everyone
[35:34] ended up on some kind of gold or silver
[35:36] standard when they had the choice. And
[35:37] it just naturally evolved um that that
[35:40] was the uh same thing that everyone
[35:43] chose all over the world. And so Larry,
[35:44] I think believes, look, there's just
[35:46] something uh good that people like about
[35:49] having some physical money that they can
[35:51] rely on. Um and maybe that's true. I
[35:53] don't know. I I tend to think, you know,
[35:55] young people today are much more
[35:57] comfortable with digital assets and
[35:59] might prefer going to Bitcoin, but a lot
[36:01] of people would just stick with dollars,
[36:02] at least for now. And so I I would love
[36:05] to see, you know, it it we don't have to
[36:07] switch back to a gold standard if we'll
[36:09] just give people the choice. And if they
[36:10] want to use gold, that's fine. But then
[36:12] a lot of them, I think, would choose to
[36:14] use Bitcoin.
[36:16] You know, if you're if you're listening
[36:17] to this right now, you should just hit
[36:20] pause and go buy Larry's book, Better
[36:23] Money. Uh, and and if Larry's listening
[36:26] to this right now, he should give Thomas
[36:28] and I a kickback for the for the ad. I
[36:31] have it sitting on my shelf, actually.
[36:34] So, so check it out. I I purchased it a
[36:36] little while ago. Uh, been it's on my
[36:38] next up reads. Uh, but yeah, excited to
[36:40] dig in because I heard a lot of good
[36:42] things and now I've just heard two more
[36:43] ringing endorsements, so I'm going to
[36:45] have to dig into it. Well, I think
[36:47] another aspect of this is like there
[36:49] people have been really slow to realize
[36:51] that there are a lot of issues with the
[36:52] current sort of international monetary
[36:55] system that were considered hypothetical
[36:57] problems that are now starting to become
[36:59] less hypothetical and more realistic.
[37:02] And so, you know, the entire the entire
[37:06] kind of reason that that Nixon suspended
[37:08] the gold standard in the first place
[37:11] was the Brettonwood system was kind was
[37:15] sort of designed um to be like a better
[37:19] gold standard, right? So it was kind of
[37:21] designed like hey the problem with the
[37:23] gold standard is that all these central
[37:24] banks you know they um when they all
[37:27] want more gold at the same time like
[37:29] this just creates like deflationary
[37:31] conditions and those are artificially
[37:33] generated conditions which you know
[37:35] impose costs on on um society and and so
[37:39] we could actually just eliminate like
[37:41] those pressures by just having gold and
[37:44] dollars be perfect substitutes because
[37:47] we can create dollars. So if everybody
[37:49] just wants more reserves what and there
[37:51] and there's not enough gold um then we
[37:54] we can create dollars and they can hold
[37:55] the dollars instead. And the problem is
[37:58] is that what the Nixon administration
[38:01] kind of learned was well I mean it
[38:04] started long before the Nixon
[38:05] administration. I mean throughout the
[38:06] 60s and then um you know it sort of
[38:09] culminated with the Nixon administration
[38:10] is that people are kind of realizing
[38:11] that this system doesn't work the way
[38:14] that it was designed because it's not
[38:16] consistent with the policy goals of the
[38:18] United States. The United States is
[38:19] going around providing um a defense
[38:22] umbrella for a lot of its allies and
[38:24] spending lots and lots of money. And um
[38:27] and if you um if you're if you're
[38:30] getting people to hold dollars, they
[38:31] need to accumulate those dollars, but
[38:32] they can't produce them, which means
[38:34] that they have to trade with you and
[38:35] acquire those dollars. And then um and
[38:38] so what what started to happen is, you
[38:42] know, there were too many dollars
[38:43] floating around in the system and and
[38:45] foreign central banks wanted their
[38:46] dollars redeemed for gold and the United
[38:49] States didn't want to do that. And so,
[38:52] you know, the original kind of
[38:53] suspension came out of a conflict
[38:55] between the Nixon administration and our
[38:57] and our European allies, which was
[38:59] basically, look, like we're providing
[39:01] these public goods to you. Um, and you
[39:04] know, what do we get in return is you
[39:06] guys complaining that there's too many
[39:07] dollars and you want to redeem them for
[39:09] gold and and that sort of thing. And
[39:11] what the United States wanted was
[39:13] basically, well, we want to continue
[39:14] doing all the things that we're doing,
[39:16] but we want you to stop complaining that
[39:18] you're not getting, you know, the gold
[39:19] back, right? like we want all the
[39:21] benefits of this system, we don't want
[39:23] the costs. And um and the Europeans were
[39:26] essentially, you know, saying the same
[39:27] thing. Yes, we want your defense
[39:28] umbrella, but we also want the gold. And
[39:30] so the um and and so this but but the
[39:34] problem is is that sort of like leaving
[39:37] that system for the current system um
[39:41] created a new problem and that is that
[39:43] what you know what replaced gold as the
[39:45] primary reserve asset of the rest of the
[39:47] world was US treasury securities and um
[39:51] that's kind of unique in human history
[39:54] that you would have this debt instrument
[39:55] that's kind of serving as like the main
[39:57] reserve asset of the rest of the world
[39:59] and The issue with that is is that you
[40:02] know when the United States is growing
[40:04] faster than other countries um that's
[40:07] that's a perfectly sustainable kind of
[40:09] model. But what we've seen over the past
[40:11] like you know um couple of decades is as
[40:14] all of these developing countries kind
[40:16] of grow faster than the United States
[40:18] because of the monetary system we have
[40:21] their demand for dollars and their
[40:22] demand for these reserve assets which
[40:24] are debt instruments for the United
[40:26] States government are growing faster um
[40:29] than than the US. And so if the US
[40:32] doesn't um increase its debt, what we
[40:35] end up with is we end up with very very
[40:37] low interest rates that cause a lot of
[40:38] distortions in the economy. On the other
[40:40] hand, if the United States supplies all
[40:42] of that debt to the rest of the world so
[40:44] that they can hold it, the United States
[40:46] starts to look like it's on an
[40:47] unsustainable trajectory for its debt.
[40:49] And so you have this trade-off, right,
[40:52] where it's do we um do we allow
[40:54] ourselves to accumulate this debt that
[40:56] might be unsustainable
[40:58] um because everybody wants this debt um
[41:01] when in reality like sort of like
[41:03] everybody wants this debt but but
[41:05] supplying it might actually undermine
[41:07] people's confidence in it in the first
[41:08] place, right? It creates this this odd
[41:10] scenario. But then if you restrict it,
[41:12] there are still all these economic costs
[41:14] associated with that because um now
[41:17] you're going to drive interest rates
[41:18] lower. you're going to get misallocation
[41:20] of capital, you're going to get all
[41:21] these kinds of um economic costs
[41:24] associated with it. And so you face this
[41:26] difficult trade-off. And people have
[41:27] been talking about this for a long time
[41:29] and warning about it for a long time.
[41:30] But I think it's only in recent years
[41:31] that people have kind of realized that
[41:33] like this isn't really just a
[41:34] hypothetical scenario. We're sort of in
[41:36] that scenario now. Well, I'm curious. I
[41:39] mean, you know, just speaking of
[41:41] unsustainable paths, I mean, you even
[41:43] had Jerome Powell uh saying on multiple
[41:46] occasions that the current debt
[41:48] trajectory of the US is unsustainable or
[41:50] I I believe he I think he used that
[41:52] exact word. Uh and you know, we see
[41:55] we're at what 36 something trillion in
[41:57] debt. And you'd see a lot of uh MMT
[42:00] folks uh say things like, oh, you know,
[42:02] the debt doesn't matter and uh you know,
[42:04] public sector debt is just a private
[42:06] sector surplus. and say we can just kind
[42:08] of forget about this and like you we
[42:10] can't ever go broke because we print the
[42:12] global reserve currency and now you have
[42:15] Trump saying things like oh we're going
[42:17] to pay down this debt like we need to be
[42:19] reducing this debt but is that actually
[42:22] feasible with where we're at right now?
[42:24] I mean the interest expense in the debt
[42:25] is I think still larger than our you
[42:28] know annual military budget. It's it's
[42:30] it's massive. It's like over a trillion
[42:32] dollars.
[42:34] Is there uh you
[42:35] know, as Lyn Alden would say, you know,
[42:38] nothing stops this train. In your
[42:39] opinions, is there anything that stops
[42:41] this train? Is there any option other
[42:44] than to continue to kick the proverbial
[42:45] can down the road as it relates to our
[42:48] monetary policy? I mean, I can't imagine
[42:52] that the folks at the, you know, the
[42:54] Federal Reserve or any politician who
[42:57] happens to be in power wants it to be on
[42:59] their watch that we go through an
[43:00] absolutely brutal reset. But that's kind
[43:04] of what's required if we want to be able
[43:06] to actually fix and like, you know, cut
[43:08] the the the dead parts out of the
[43:10] system, right? I mean, do they have
[43:12] another path? I want to I want to say
[43:14] this very clearly because I don't have
[43:16] the opportunity to say it very often. I
[43:19] agree with Jay Powell.
[43:22] Wow. On the record. On the record.
[43:27] Mark the date and time. It's not
[43:28] something I've said that often, but I
[43:30] agree with Jay Powell. You know, the
[43:31] debt is unsustainable. Um, I do want to
[43:34] I do want to say we we should we should
[43:36] probably think
[43:38] about, you know, why the debt is
[43:40] unsustainable a bit more than than most
[43:43] people typically do. I think there's
[43:46] this there's this idea that well since
[43:48] the debt is growing it's getting so big
[43:51] maybe because it's you know it crossed
[43:53] some threshold like 100% of GDP right
[43:56] that therefore it's
[43:58] unsustainable but you got to think about
[44:00] you know good debt and bad debt right um
[44:03] you know I currently have some debt I I
[44:06] purchased a house a few years ago um I'm
[44:09] not concerned about that at all um many
[44:13] of my students um will will take on some
[44:17] debt to uh finance their education and
[44:20] they're you know they're they're
[44:22] learning economics from me so they're
[44:24] going to do very well
[44:27] good investment right so those are those
[44:29] look like productive um you know
[44:32] borrowing um and if what the US
[44:34] government were doing were you know
[44:37] making use of its you know uh privilege
[44:42] as the the global reserve
[44:44] currency issuer and uh you know taking
[44:47] out debt at at very low rates because
[44:51] people want our um our our treasury so
[44:54] much. And it was using this to make
[44:57] valuable
[44:58] investments or at least you know
[45:01] purchasing some asset that will have
[45:03] some rate of return that they can you
[45:05] know is very liquid and they can sell if
[45:09] need be and capture the the spread in
[45:11] the meantime. But of course that's not
[45:13] what they're doing, right? Most of the
[45:15] expenditures are on current consumption,
[45:17] right? Um and so this looks a lot less
[45:20] like say financing an education or
[45:25] financing some productive business and a
[45:28] lot more like having one heck of a
[45:30] weekend in Las Vegas. Um and you know,
[45:34] so that I think is the the real problem
[45:37] here with the debt. It's not so much the
[45:40] size of the debt though certainly when
[45:43] you you know you have an interest
[45:44] expense there um and and interest rate
[45:47] risk when you have uh that much um debt
[45:50] but it's not so much the size of the
[45:52] debt but rather it's the the the
[45:55] spending that has taken place as a
[45:58] result of that debt and what we got for
[46:00] that and what we got you know was some
[46:02] very happy old people um but
[46:04] unfortunately that doesn't that doesn't
[46:07] bolster ability to repay that debt in
[46:09] the future very much. Um, so that I
[46:12] think is why it's a worrisome to me.
[46:15] Yep. Uh, let me mention a couple things
[46:17] more specifically about that. So, so
[46:19] totally agree with what Will said, but
[46:21] if we're thinking about the composition
[46:24] of spending and what is big and
[46:25] important. Um, there's an important
[46:27] difference between discretionary and
[46:29] non-discretionary spending. And so every
[46:31] year we pass a well we don't always pass
[46:34] a budget but when there are arguments
[46:35] about what should go into the budget and
[46:37] what government is spending money on
[46:39] that is all discretionary spending that
[46:41] are short-term commitments and
[46:43] non-discretionary spending is long-term
[46:45] commitments that we've promised people
[46:47] money. Part of this is uh could be
[46:49] defense spending that we've committed to
[46:51] for decades in the future. But a large
[46:52] part of it is and the most worrisome
[46:54] part is Medicare, Medicaid, Social
[46:56] Security. And so those things are, if
[46:59] you've seen these graphs where our debt
[47:01] just exponentially goes off the charts,
[47:03] that's largely because of increases in
[47:06] uh Medicare and Medicaid and to some
[47:08] degree social security as well, although
[47:10] that'll probably plateau after baby
[47:11] boomers. Um, but the the big deal is
[47:15] part part of the part of the solution
[47:17] potentially is that the exponential
[47:19] growth is largely caused by promising
[47:22] people more money in the future than
[47:23] retirees are getting today, even in
[47:25] inflationadjusted terms. So, we're
[47:27] promising people that are retire in the
[47:30] future more than we're paying people
[47:32] that are retiring today. And if we were
[47:34] just willing to say, hey, look, people
[47:36] that retire in the future get the same
[47:38] amount adjusted for inflation as people
[47:40] get today, it would basically cut off
[47:42] the exponential growth and be something
[47:45] that we could p potentially manage
[47:46] through, you know, other other small
[47:48] cuts and not something that's going to
[47:50] blow up and completely destroy the um
[47:54] the country, right? And so, um, so the
[47:56] problem is nobody wants to make those
[47:58] small changes. You know, even Donald
[48:00] Trump has said he doesn't he doesn't
[48:01] want to make those kind of cuts. And so,
[48:03] unless we can get some kind of political
[48:05] commitment to do that, then we're going
[48:07] to continue to have a problem. I mean,
[48:09] it it's possible. Um, Canada did it in
[48:12] the 1990s when they had a budget that
[48:14] was going to blow up. They actually cut
[48:15] their spending by about 50%. It's still
[48:18] higher than we are today. it was like
[48:20] 60% of their GDP at that time and they
[48:22] cut it to 30. Uh, which is still a
[48:25] little bit more than we have in the
[48:26] United States. Um, but you know, it just
[48:29] seems like we're not going to do that
[48:30] until we're on the precipice, until
[48:32] we're about to fall off the cliff and
[48:34] destroy the economy. You know, that's
[48:36] when we're finally going to get people
[48:37] together. It would be better if they if
[48:39] we could get some kind of political
[48:41] traction, but it just doesn't seem like
[48:42] we're going to do that. um if we had a
[48:45] gold standard or like a Bitcoin standard
[48:47] or something that was going to prevent
[48:49] overspending in terms of monetary
[48:51] policy, maybe that would handcuff the
[48:54] federal spending as well because there
[48:56] wouldn't be this outlet, wouldn't be
[48:57] this possibility to inflate away the
[48:59] debt. Um and so maybe that would help a
[49:02] little bit, but you know, we don't know.
[49:04] We're not close to really either of
[49:06] those things right now. Well, and I
[49:08] think the other thing is we really have
[49:09] to kind of reflect on the fact that the
[49:12] world that we live in now is is kind of
[49:15] weird in the sense
[49:17] that governments, Western governments
[49:21] um essentially just after World War II,
[49:24] they became like massive insurance
[49:26] companies, right? So where you pay your
[49:29] premiums and taxes and then and then the
[49:31] spending, you know, and then you get
[49:33] your benefits through the government
[49:34] spending. And I think like this is
[49:36] something that we we significantly
[49:38] discount because most people alive today
[49:40] have never sort of lived in a different
[49:41] world. But I mean if you go back um
[49:44] before World War II and you look at most
[49:47] governments the the main thing that
[49:49] governments were spending money on was
[49:50] like national defense, right? Like so
[49:52] they they were spending money on armies
[49:54] and wars and things like that. But but
[49:56] the point is is that that was that was
[49:58] like the majority of their spending. And
[50:00] what's really happened over, you know,
[50:03] um, the last, I guess, you know,
[50:04] threequarters of a century is that what
[50:06] what we've had is just this massive
[50:10] expansion expansion of entitlement
[50:12] programs, right? And so the creation of
[50:14] these entitlement programs is where a
[50:17] lot of this uh, a lot of these spending
[50:19] obligations come from. And and another
[50:21] important aspect of this too is like you
[50:23] can't even necessarily solve these these
[50:25] obligations by printing money because if
[50:28] you think about how Medicare works, yes,
[50:30] we we budget Medicare in terms of like
[50:32] you know the the amount of dollars that
[50:34] you have to spend. But what the
[50:36] obligations really are are like new hips
[50:38] and new knees and um you know cancer
[50:41] treatments and things like that. And so,
[50:44] you know, as you create inflation,
[50:47] um, by by printing money, you're you're
[50:49] also making those things more more
[50:51] expensive, right? And so, you don't, you
[50:54] know, it's not possible to just kind of
[50:56] like inflate away those costs. And like
[50:58] with social security, you know, you get
[51:00] cost, you know, recipients of social
[51:02] security get cost of living adjustments.
[51:04] So, as you're creating inflation, like
[51:05] what you owe to those people who are on
[51:07] social security is also going up. And so
[51:10] a lot of times like we think well
[51:12] inflation is a way out of this. Well
[51:13] inflation can eat away at the value of
[51:15] the debt because you could just print a
[51:17] bunch of money and pay off the debtors
[51:18] and kind of you know um uh start over.
[51:21] But but there are these other budgetary
[51:23] consequences of doing these things. And
[51:25] the extent to which governments have
[51:27] just become massive insurance companies,
[51:28] I think is a is a sort of missing
[51:31] element of of this discussion is that
[51:33] yes, the international monetary system
[51:35] creates some really bad incentives,
[51:36] especially for the United States
[51:38] government. Um, but you've also got the
[51:41] these entitlement programs on the other
[51:43] side. And so just fixing the monetary
[51:45] system is not necessarily going to fix
[51:46] the problem because you've got to figure
[51:48] out how you're going to pay for these
[51:49] these obligations uh to all of these
[51:51] people. and the fact that like
[51:53] entitlements are only ever growing. And
[51:55] then there are also the hardest things
[51:57] to get rid of because you've made
[51:58] promises to people. And so to make to to
[52:01] have reforms, you have to reig on those
[52:04] promises. And you know, governments
[52:06] don't want to reig on the promises. They
[52:07] like them. It's to to quote, you know,
[52:09] to paraphrase an old Seinfeld episode,
[52:11] right? It's not the it's not the taking
[52:13] of the promise. It's not the making of
[52:14] the promises that's the important part.
[52:16] It's the keeping of the promises that uh
[52:19] that that that are the important part.
[52:21] And so no one wants to bear the cost of
[52:23] having to, you know, tell people that
[52:25] no, we can't actually follow through on
[52:27] this promise that we made to you. I
[52:29] mean, do you think that there's uh does
[52:32] does Bitcoin fix this? Not to be cliche,
[52:34] but in any meaningful way, like I know
[52:36] uh I believe it was uh Senator Lumis'
[52:39] bill where she proposed, you know,
[52:40] acquiring a certain amount of Bitcoin
[52:42] and then the only way that uh we would
[52:44] ever dispose of any of that Bitcoin
[52:46] would be to pay down the debt. uh you
[52:48] know presumably part of that that debt
[52:50] is also being you know racked up due to
[52:53] uh due to some of these these
[52:54] entitlements as well which continue to
[52:55] grow and grow and grow in size. Does
[52:58] Bitcoin uh does a government holding a
[53:02] significant amount of Bitcoin uh and
[53:04] appreciating asset rapidly appreciating
[53:07] does that in any way allow them to be
[53:10] more uh fiscally sound let's say even
[53:13] though they're issuing a depreciating
[53:15] currency? they're, you know, is does
[53:17] that impose or provide any sort of uh
[53:21] does it impose any sort of strict, you
[53:24] know, kind of uh limits on them or does
[53:26] it provide any sort of benefit where
[53:28] down the road, oh look, we actually are
[53:30] solvent because the value of our
[53:31] holdings has increased so much that now
[53:34] turns out we can keep all these promises
[53:37] that we made or is that just a you know
[53:39] just some a Bitcoin maximalist pipe
[53:42] dream uh government edition. So I think
[53:44] there are two things that you have
[53:46] to you have to believe in order to think
[53:49] that the strategic Bitcoin reserve fixes
[53:52] this. The first is in terms of the
[53:55] return on Bitcoin, right? If if you
[53:59] don't have say a significant increase in
[54:01] the demand for Bitcoin over time, then
[54:04] the you know the the price of Bitcoin
[54:06] doesn't go up or doesn't go up um as
[54:09] fast as other assets and so it's not a
[54:12] good investment, right? So, you have to
[54:14] believe that. And I think that, you
[54:16] know, this is where a lot of Bitcoiners
[54:19] stop, right? They say, "Well, of course,
[54:21] we're going to get a big return." And
[54:23] so, um, this is going to solve all of
[54:26] our problems. So, what I want to say is
[54:28] let's table that. Let's suppose that
[54:30] that's true, right? We don't even have
[54:32] to think about, you know, whether or not
[54:34] that return is going to be less than
[54:37] whatever you believe it will be. Suppose
[54:39] that it is whatever you think it will
[54:41] be. Does that solve the problem? Well, I
[54:44] I kind of think of it, maybe you've read
[54:46] these old books, the the the Hunger
[54:48] Games. They were popular maybe a decade
[54:51] ago, right? Where where folks in the
[54:53] capital had had decided that um I think
[54:57] they could that they could take a pill
[54:58] and not get fat. Basically, it just made
[55:00] them all
[55:01] bulimic, right? Um, well, if if the
[55:05] government has this big new revenue
[55:08] source, right, that return on on
[55:10] Bitcoin, does it use it to pay down its
[55:13] debt to be more fiscally responsible?
[55:17] Well, it it's not being fiscally
[55:20] responsible with its current budget. So,
[55:23] why would we expect it to be fiscally
[55:25] responsible with a bigger budget, right?
[55:28] And so we can set this entire
[55:31] conversation about what the expected
[55:33] return on Bitcoin is aside. We still
[55:37] have to find some mechanism to get the
[55:40] government to be fiscally responsible.
[55:43] If we don't do that, it doesn't matter
[55:45] what the return on these assets uh are.
[55:48] Um the government's going to spend it
[55:50] all and then some. So uh I think that's
[55:54] you know a difficult nut to crack.
[55:58] There's also a catch 22 here, right?
[56:00] Because if you think about like pretty
[56:02] much every model of fiat money that we
[56:04] have in economics has two um equilibria.
[56:08] So there's an equilibrium where the fiat
[56:10] money has positive value and there's an
[56:13] equilibrium where fiat money has zero
[56:16] value and what we call the transition
[56:19] from uh that positive value equilibrium
[56:22] to the zero value equilibrium is
[56:24] hyperinflation. Right? And so the thing
[56:26] is is
[56:27] that the the quirky thing about these
[56:30] models of fiat money suggests that the
[56:33] one way to get from um that positive
[56:38] value equilibrium to the zero value
[56:40] equilibrium can be that there there's
[56:43] some big event that happens which
[56:45] creates self-fulfilling expectations
[56:47] that we're going to zero, right? And so
[56:49] that the money is going to be worthless.
[56:51] And so, you know, it's kind of a catch22
[56:54] here in the sense that, yeah, if you if
[56:56] you expect Bitcoin's price to
[56:58] appreciate, if you expect to make very
[57:00] large returns on on Bitcoin, having the
[57:04] government own Bitcoin could be
[57:05] beneficial to them, if you know, they
[57:08] they um don't change their spending
[57:10] behavior in the meantime. And if Bitcoin
[57:12] appreciates the way that they expect,
[57:14] then yeah, in the future, um you could
[57:17] you could sell some of this and start
[57:18] paying down, you know, your debt
[57:20] obligations. The issue is is like to
[57:22] what extent do you start buying this?
[57:23] Because if you're looking at your debt
[57:26] situation and you're thinking maybe we
[57:27] should buy some Bitcoin because maybe
[57:29] this is getting
[57:30] unsustainable. Well, then surely the
[57:32] people holding your debt are also
[57:34] thinking the same thing about your your
[57:35] debt. And so if they see you going out
[57:38] and buying tons and tons of Bitcoin, uh
[57:41] they might look at you and say, "Uh
[57:43] maybe things are really worse than we
[57:45] thought." Which pushes you towards that
[57:47] self-fulfilling
[57:48] uh equilibrium. So I think you know
[57:51] there's this little catch 22 here where
[57:53] maybe if you do this on a on a smaller
[57:55] scale you don't have to worry about
[57:57] that. Um but then of course that limits
[57:59] your ability to kind of pay down uh the
[58:02] debt with your returns. On the other
[58:03] hands the larger scale that you do this
[58:06] it it might enable you to if you're
[58:08] correct it might enable you to pay down
[58:10] a lot of this debt but the problem is in
[58:11] the meantime it might scare people into
[58:13] thinking that things are really bad and
[58:15] much worse than they have realized. um
[58:17] in which case you sort of set off the
[58:19] event that you're that you're trying to
[58:20] prevent in the first place. This is a
[58:23] this is an upside to to President Trump,
[58:26] right? Because most people that you know
[58:28] rightly or wrongly just assume that he
[58:30] doesn't know anything about economics
[58:32] that he does these dumb things. And so
[58:35] when he says like, "Oh, strategic
[58:36] Bitcoin reserve are going to buy a bunch
[58:38] of Bitcoin." Right? It doesn't initially
[58:40] set off this fear like maybe things are
[58:42] worse than than we think they are. It's
[58:44] like, oh, this guy just does stupid
[58:46] things. So, it's probably nothing,
[58:48] right? Whereas screen, if a if a typical
[58:51] president did this, then I would expect
[58:54] that mechanism that Josh is talking
[58:56] about to kick in much sooner, right?
[58:58] Like, well, wait, he must be doing this
[58:59] for a good reason. What is that reason?
[59:01] Uh so, so maybe we have some cover here
[59:03] for a moment. Yeah, that it's funny that
[59:06] that spending issue with Bitcoin is the
[59:08] same same thing is true for inflation,
[59:10] you know. So if the if the government's
[59:12] holding Bitcoin and they think, well,
[59:14] you know, now we have this valuable
[59:16] asset, so our debt's not as bad. We can
[59:18] spend a little more. And the same thing
[59:19] is true with inflation. They're like,
[59:21] well, inflation's terrible, but it's at
[59:22] least it's pushing up the value of our
[59:24] Bitcoin, right? Yeah. Yeah. It really I
[59:28] mean, what a what a beautifully vicious
[59:29] cycle there, right? You start to want to
[59:32] devalue a little bit faster and then
[59:33] it's a just a it's a race to zero, I
[59:36] suppose, all uh all around the world.
[59:38] Well, I'm I'm curious too, you know, uh
[59:42] do you think just as it relates to the
[59:44] US specifically? I mean, there's been a
[59:46] lot of talk about, you know, kind of the
[59:48] end of of dollar dominance and, you
[59:50] know, a lot of uh a lot of trade being
[59:52] settled outside of that dollar system.
[59:55] uh that you know are we entering in your
[59:57] opinion a new uh a new era of that kind
[60:00] of you know bitcoin aside maybe just
[60:02] like what we're already seeing like
[60:04] talking about right now in your minds
[60:06] have you do you see a shift already is
[60:09] that a shift that is ultimately you know
[60:11] is is that in the long run maybe it's
[60:13] it's positive for the American citizen
[60:15] it's bad for the American government
[60:18] like how do you see that that working
[60:20] out and or or do you think you know the
[60:22] the dollar stays the the biggest kid at
[60:24] schoolyard for some time to come.
[60:28] So I I think so Josh probably has some
[60:31] uh comments about the system that we may
[60:34] be switching to. Um but I'll just say
[60:36] like it I I personally am not as worried
[60:40] about the threats to dollar dominance
[60:42] because we've heard the same kind of
[60:43] thing over and over for decades. you
[60:45] know, it was going to be the euro that
[60:47] was going to overtake the dollar and it
[60:48] was going to be the Chinese yuan that
[60:50] was going to overtake the dollar. And
[60:51] then recently this there was this
[60:53] proposal from the the BRICS nations, you
[60:56] know, uh br uh Brazil, Russia, India and
[60:59] China that maybe they were going to put
[61:01] together a gold standard. I was doing
[61:03] interviews a year ago when they floated
[61:05] this idea and people were asking like
[61:07] what if what if uh China and Russia
[61:08] introduced a gold standard and and you
[61:10] know have these international currency
[61:12] that redeem redeemable for gold and I
[61:14] was like do you really trust uh Russia
[61:17] and China to hold your gold like those
[61:19] countries aren't really known for a good
[61:21] property rights you know it's like oh
[61:23] yeah I definitely want to give China my
[61:25] gold and have them you know give them a
[61:27] redeemable like no no I'm not concerned
[61:29] about that at all um are we going to see
[61:32] uh more usage of Bitcoin. I don't know.
[61:34] I think that would be great. I mean, we
[61:35] do see a number of countries that have
[61:38] dollarized that have given up their own
[61:40] currency to use dollars instead. And
[61:42] that typically happens because their
[61:44] central banks are irresponsible and the
[61:46] people in those countries don't trust
[61:48] the government to control the
[61:49] currencies. So, they switch to something
[61:51] more reliable. And I see that as an
[61:53] opportunity for Bitcoin. Um but I don't
[61:56] know that that at least in the short
[61:58] term that would lead to rivals for um
[62:01] international usage of the dollar. It
[62:03] could um I think we do see some people
[62:05] that want to switch in international
[62:07] trade to a more stable currency. The
[62:10] Swiss Frank is actually a great example
[62:12] of that that it is widely used in
[62:14] international trade despite the fact
[62:16] that Switzerland is very small. Not that
[62:18] people many people are actually trading
[62:20] with Switzerland, but they want to use
[62:22] the Swiss Frank because they know it's
[62:23] stable. And so I think um Bitcoin could
[62:27] be used in international trade, but if
[62:29] it is used more, it maybe is stealing u
[62:31] market share from something like the
[62:33] Swiss Frank or from other countries as
[62:35] much as it does from the dollar.
[62:39] I mean, as an American, I I um I tend to
[62:42] think that I'm a beneficiary of dollar
[62:45] dominance. Um you know, we have this
[62:48] exorbitant privilege. We send the rest
[62:51] of the world dollars which cost us
[62:53] basically nothing to produce and they
[62:55] send us valuable goods and services.
[62:58] That's a pretty good deal. I've been
[63:00] trying to get other people to like
[63:02] accept, you know, things that cost me
[63:04] nothing to produce in exchange for
[63:05] valuable goods and services. No one will
[63:07] take me up on it. Um but at least on the
[63:10] national level, even even if the
[63:11] government, you know, squanders a big
[63:14] portion of that, um I think we're we're
[63:16] still beneficiaries of that.
[63:20] Um that said, you know, what it does
[63:23] seem like we're losing some of that.
[63:26] It's kind of a situation where um you
[63:30] know, it's uh like the dollar is dying.
[63:32] Long live the dollar. Um we're, you
[63:35] know, we're still the international
[63:37] reserve currency, but there are more
[63:40] contenders today than there were in the
[63:42] past. Um and maybe that's good for those
[63:45] places.
[63:47] Um, I think there's some debate about
[63:50] that. Um, I think it's difficult to
[63:52] argue that the the decline of dollar
[63:55] dominance will be good for the US. Um,
[63:59] though I wouldn't rule that out either.
[64:02] Maybe Josh will persuade
[64:03] me. Well, I think there's a couple of
[64:05] things here. So I mean one thing is
[64:07] there should be nothing more
[64:10] um uh there there's no prediction that
[64:14] has been more humbling for economists
[64:15] for the last like you know 30 to 40
[64:18] years than oh the dollar uh can't
[64:20] survive in this system. I mean there you
[64:22] can go back and you can find very very
[64:24] prominent economists talking about you
[64:26] know the decline of the dollar um you
[64:29] know 30 for the last 30 to 40 years and
[64:32] it hasn't happened and so you know it's
[64:35] that should that should be an incredibly
[64:37] humbling experience and that should give
[64:38] you some pause when you when you predict
[64:40] it but I do think that uh a lot of
[64:42] people on the other side of that
[64:43] argument are a little too arrogant about
[64:45] it and and the reason I say that is if
[64:47] you just look
[64:49] historically you know um the
[64:52] international gold standard which I
[64:53] think in our heads we think was this
[64:54] really really long like period of time
[64:56] really only lasted about 40 years and um
[65:00] you know and then we had the inner war
[65:02] period and we had the Bretton Woods
[65:03] period and the Bretton Woods period you
[65:05] know lasted even less time and the sort
[65:08] of system that we're in has lasted
[65:10] longer than both of those but now we're
[65:12] starting to see evidence that that um
[65:15] you know of the the sort of inherent
[65:17] problems with this system and so I think
[65:19] that it's naive to think that the system
[65:21] would go on forever. But saying that
[65:23] something can't go on forever um doesn't
[65:25] actually give you a timeline for when it
[65:27] ends either, right? Um I do think like
[65:30] the most interesting thing to me about
[65:33] American politics
[65:35] um has been um the dramatic change
[65:40] uh in the discussion of the dollar uh in
[65:44] our national politics. If you look at
[65:46] the people in the Trump administration,
[65:49] um these people are sort of universally
[65:52] concerned about this. Um they want to
[65:54] maintain dollar dominance. Um but they
[65:57] want to do so in ways that minimize
[65:59] minimize the costs of dollar dominance.
[66:02] Now the question is whether you could
[66:03] actually do that or not. So like their
[66:05] opponents are essentially saying well if
[66:07] you if you do these things like you're
[66:09] going to end you're you're actually
[66:10] going to end dollar dominance, right?
[66:12] But they clearly believe that they could
[66:14] reduce some of the costs without
[66:15] necessarily um having a similar
[66:19] reduction in the benefits. But you see
[66:20] this from top to bottom. I mean you see
[66:22] this with with Steven Moran at uh the uh
[66:26] Council of Economic Advisors. You see
[66:27] this with Scott Bent at Treasury. you
[66:30] know, there's very consistent messaging
[66:31] coming from these people that sort of
[66:32] this system is not working for us and
[66:35] that there are significant costs and
[66:37] that maybe the costs are starting to
[66:39] outweigh the benefits and that we need
[66:40] to rethink this kind of a system. But I
[66:43] think from the United States's
[66:44] perspective, like I think their
[66:46] objective is, you know, giving saying
[66:50] nice things about gold, saying nice
[66:52] things about Bitcoin is actually kind of
[66:55] in the interests of the US government.
[66:57] Um, from this perspective, because one
[67:00] of the reasons that the United States is
[67:01] afraid to give up this dollar dominance
[67:03] is they don't want to transfer that
[67:04] dominance to some other currency. They
[67:06] don't want dollar dominance to become
[67:08] euro dominance or yuan dominance, right?
[67:11] they um uh they they would prefer to
[67:14] keep that for themselves. But even if
[67:16] you have to give up some of the benefits
[67:18] um you would like the the benefits that
[67:20] disappear to sort of dissipate, right?
[67:22] So, and and so if people are moving from
[67:26] US treasuries into holding things like
[67:28] gold and Bitcoin on their balance sheet,
[67:31] um then you're not actually transferring
[67:33] the benefits of dollar dominance to some
[67:35] other sovereign country because they're
[67:36] buying these neutral reserve assets and
[67:38] those neutral reserve assets u there's
[67:41] no issuer that's benefiting from that,
[67:44] right? There's no monopoly issuer that
[67:46] benefits from that. And so I think that
[67:49] to the extent that they say positive
[67:50] things about gold and Bitcoin, I think
[67:52] it's very strategic in the sense that
[67:54] they recognize that in order to keep the
[67:58] current system of dollar dominance um
[68:01] but reduce uh some of the costs
[68:03] associated with that system, you need
[68:06] people who are concerned about the
[68:07] system to move towards neutral assets
[68:09] and not other sovereign uh assets.
[68:14] I think that's it's very interesting. I
[68:16] I want to I want to maybe go back in
[68:19] history a little bit. Uh one one thing
[68:20] first uh William just to to your point
[68:22] of you know like uh we've been
[68:24] beneficiaries of this this system right
[68:27] with the dollar as the global reserve
[68:28] currency. We export you know inflation
[68:30] becomes our number one export. We're
[68:32] really good at it because you know our
[68:33] marginal cost of production for each of
[68:35] those dollars especially when they're
[68:36] digital is is zero. Uh but you know then
[68:40] you look at uh something like the
[68:42] fantastic website you know uh WTF
[68:44] happened in
[68:45] 1971 and you realize well like by what
[68:49] metric have we been the beneficiaries
[68:51] you know uh from a global dominance
[68:53] perspective perhaps from a a cheap
[68:55] Chinese goods perspective perhaps but
[68:57] from you know life expectancy from
[68:59] happiness from suicide rates from all
[69:02] these other metrics I think you can make
[69:04] a compelling argument that perhaps this
[69:06] system hasn't been beneficial for the
[69:08] majority of Americans, even though we
[69:10] enjoy the highest standard of living in
[69:13] the world. By other metrics, it's it's a
[69:16] little bit murkier. Um, I'm not I'm not
[69:18] saying you're wrong, just more so that
[69:19] there's there's a lot to that. And I
[69:22] think it's uh that's some of maybe
[69:24] what's being realized now with, you
[69:25] know, the destruction of the American
[69:27] manufacturing class and the creation of
[69:30] this very rusty belt that we have and
[69:32] what kind of Trump is trying to do uh
[69:35] purportedly with these tariffs, right,
[69:37] to try and reshore some of that
[69:39] manufacturing that was offshore because
[69:41] we were exporting inflation instead. And
[69:43] I would love to get because I'm I have
[69:46] seen so many conflicting opinions on
[69:48] tariffs. Uh I would love to get your
[69:51] guys' thoughts on these as as
[69:53] economists.
[69:55] Uh what do you think? Um good, bad,
[69:58] ugly, what are you know is this 4D
[70:02] chess? Is this uh not 4D chess? What are
[70:06] we dealing with here? How are you guys
[70:07] thinking about this? What Yeah, please
[70:11] help me understand. Let me uh before we
[70:13] turn to tariffs, let me just uh push
[70:15] back again uh against the uh the the
[70:18] standard of living question. Right. So,
[70:21] um you know, I I grew up very poor. Um
[70:25] I'm from rural southern Ohio. Um my my
[70:29] parents were on welfare when I was a
[70:31] kid. I lived in government housing. Um
[70:34] uh a very poor area of the country. Um,
[70:38] also an area that's been hit very hard
[70:40] by the opioid epidemic. Um, there's a
[70:43] there's a journalist, um, I think he's
[70:45] with the LA Times named Sam Kones who
[70:48] wrote a book a few years ago about the
[70:50] opioid epidemic in the in the US titled
[70:53] Dreamland. And the only reason I
[70:55] remember the title of this book is
[70:56] because the the name of the book comes
[71:00] from a pool in Portsmouth, Ohio, which
[71:03] is where I grew up, right? It was the
[71:05] the community pool that my dad went to
[71:07] as a kid, right? And so this was
[71:09] literally the center of the opioid
[71:12] epidemic. Um, and you know, I visit my
[71:15] family there almost every summer. Um,
[71:19] my, you know, my sister grew up in the
[71:21] same household that I did. She still
[71:23] lives there.
[71:26] Um, didn't go to college.
[71:29] uh and yet has a a much higher standard
[71:33] of living than we had as kids, her kids
[71:36] are doing great, right? And so even the
[71:38] folks that, you know, we would be
[71:41] inclined to think are are being left
[71:43] behind, folks in the rust belt who
[71:45] didn't go to college, who didn't move
[71:47] away, you know, most of those folks have
[71:51] a higher standard of living as well.
[71:53] Now, we might say it could be even
[71:55] higher perhaps, but the the reality and
[71:58] what I think is just the undeniable
[72:00] reality is that technological progress
[72:03] has been so incredible that even the
[72:07] least welloff in the US or certainly
[72:10] most of the least welloff in the US are
[72:13] are just much better off today than they
[72:16] were 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago. um
[72:21] despite this this you know ongoing
[72:24] political rhetoric that that um some you
[72:27] know that folks have just been left
[72:29] behind and their living standards have
[72:31] stagnated. Um I think that it's really
[72:34] difficult to actually go to those places
[72:37] particularly if if you lived there at
[72:39] some point in the past and honestly say
[72:42] that the living standard is worse today
[72:44] than it was when it was you know uh
[72:47] then. But do you attribute that more so
[72:50] to the export of inflation or to the uh
[72:54] uh unstoppable march of deflationary
[72:57] technology and the productivity gains
[72:59] that it brings along with it? Certainly
[73:01] it's not due to inflation, right? But,
[73:04] um, you know, if we're if we're going to
[73:06] have a conversation about whether or not
[73:09] trade is good or, um, whether or not
[73:12] these tariffs are going to make us
[73:14] better off or worse off, we we kind of
[73:16] have to start with the the facts of the
[73:19] situation. And I think a lot of folks
[73:23] believe that
[73:25] um you know places you know people who
[73:29] who were born in places like Portsmouth,
[73:31] Ohio are obviously worse off today than
[73:35] um they were a generation ago. Um and I
[73:39] just don't think that's true. uh even in
[73:42] the places that have been been hit hard
[73:44] by say the China shock or um or the
[73:48] opioid epidemic or or what have you,
[73:51] folks in those places are also doing
[73:53] better uh today than they were a
[73:55] generation ago. Um and that so the
[73:58] relevant question is would they be
[74:00] better or worse off? Um but but we
[74:03] should recognize at the outset that
[74:05] they're um they're doing better than
[74:07] they were, which I think is is not as
[74:10] widely appreciated as it should be. I
[74:12] think one of the things that's not
[74:13] really understood is like this is often
[74:15] framed in economic terms like uh about
[74:19] decline, but I think mostly what people
[74:21] are talking about are things that are
[74:24] kind of like related to economics, but
[74:26] not necessarily like um so like they're
[74:29] related to your standard of living, but
[74:30] they're not necessarily how we would
[74:32] calculate your standard of living, if
[74:33] that makes sense. I think a lot of what
[74:35] people are complaining about is like
[74:37] declines in social capital, right? like
[74:39] there's um you know in in these places
[74:43] um you know there's not as much
[74:45] community as there used to be. Um I
[74:48] think uh you know another issue is is
[74:51] like um you know what these kinds of
[74:53] things have done to families. I mean, if
[74:54] you look at um like single parent
[74:57] households and things like that um where
[74:59] you see rises in single parent
[75:01] households as you see this um in
[75:03] communities like where people maybe
[75:06] would have used to work in factories,
[75:08] right? And a lot of that is because you
[75:11] have people who have maybe a maximum of
[75:13] a high school education. In a previous
[75:16] generation, they probably would have
[75:17] gone to the factory. They would have
[75:18] gotten a job. They would have made a
[75:19] good income and they would have been
[75:21] considered husband material.
[75:23] and now they don't have those same job
[75:25] prospects and so they're not really
[75:27] considered husband material but yet
[75:29] they're part of the dating market and so
[75:31] occasionally you know um they have
[75:33] children with with other people but then
[75:35] those other people choose to raise those
[75:37] children on their own because they don't
[75:39] believe that that man can sort of um can
[75:41] can sort of support them. I think that's
[75:44] really what people are kind of u talking
[75:46] about is like there there are social
[75:48] aspects of decline that they see um
[75:52] which is sort of like the rise in in
[75:54] single parent households the the rise in
[75:57] uh or the decline in sort of social
[76:00] capital and just you know this this
[76:02] sense of community and I think that's
[76:04] really what people are kind of pointing
[76:06] to and then on top of that it's not just
[76:08] that people like see these things it's
[76:10] that they don't see politicians
[76:14] as reactive to that at all. Right? They
[76:17] see the politicians as basically
[76:18] ignoring that. Um
[76:21] and I think like you know a different
[76:24] way of stating like Will's point is you
[76:26] know uh there was a Nobel Prize winning
[76:28] economist Robert Lucas and you know he
[76:32] he sort of famously said like once you
[76:34] start thinking about economic growth
[76:35] it's hard to think about anything else.
[76:37] And the point that he was making when he
[76:39] said that is that the the magnitude of
[76:42] the effects of economic growth are so
[76:44] large that they dwarf a lot of other
[76:47] effects. So you can have negative things
[76:49] going on, right? And um uh but if you
[76:53] but if you have those negative things
[76:54] going on in the midst of economic
[76:56] growth, a lot of times economic growth
[76:58] can kind of offset those things. But the
[77:00] thing that but economic growth is
[77:02] doesn't necessarily generate like a
[77:04] sense of community, right? economic
[77:06] growth doesn't necessarily um lead to
[77:08] like healthy marriage markets, right? It
[77:11] depends on what's going on in where
[77:13] where you are and it depends on a lot of
[77:14] other things. And so I think that look
[77:17] at the end of the day like these things
[77:18] I mean at the end of the day everything
[77:20] is an economic issue, right? Like if
[77:22] you're raising a a a child alone I you
[77:26] can frame that as an economic issue,
[77:28] okay? U but you could also frame it as a
[77:30] social issue. But I think that a lot of
[77:31] times these things all get kind of
[77:32] lumped together. But I think that's a
[77:34] lot of what people are complaining about
[77:36] is um that um it's not so much that
[77:41] they're saying, "Hey, things are worse."
[77:44] I think what they're really saying is
[77:45] like things could be better, right? Like
[77:48] we could have it better than we do. Like
[77:50] if we had all of this technology that we
[77:52] have now and there was still that
[77:55] factory down the street, like things
[77:56] would be much better. I think that's the
[77:58] argument that people are are are making
[78:00] often times. But it's hard because when
[78:02] you're talking about growth effects
[78:04] versus distribution effects and things
[78:05] like that, it gets very very messy in
[78:08] terms of thinking about, you know, what
[78:10] what are costs and what are benefits and
[78:11] whether somebody is better off in an
[78:13] absolute sense versus a relative sense
[78:15] and all and all of those kinds of
[78:17] things.
[78:19] Yeah, I I'll uh follow up on this a
[78:22] little bit to say like I I totally agree
[78:24] with those things and I think you know
[78:26] it in terms of what's causing those. So
[78:28] we can say like look people are are
[78:30] better off but they're maybe not happy
[78:32] for different reasons because there are
[78:34] some bad things that are happening and
[78:36] and what's causing those you know partly
[78:38] inflation I think is a problem that
[78:40] creates distortions in the economy but
[78:42] there are a lot of other things as well
[78:43] you know we have regulations that are
[78:45] going to prevent jobs in a lot of areas
[78:48] and if those jobs move because the
[78:50] industry changes and moves away from
[78:52] manufacturing to other places you know
[78:54] people don't move like they used to in
[78:56] the United States they don't move to
[78:58] where their jobs are partly because of,
[79:00] you know, welfare programs and other
[79:02] things that just make it difficult and
[79:03] inter interfere with the market and all
[79:06] that makes it harder for Americans. Um,
[79:09] we could also think about in
[79:11] specifically in terms of tariffs, you
[79:12] know, there are a variety of of
[79:14] arguments. I think most economists just
[79:16] don't want people to interfere with free
[79:18] trade. Um, but I think Will and Josh and
[79:21] I all all think, well, look, there are a
[79:24] lot of other distortions. You know, we
[79:25] could talk about the changes in uh taxes
[79:29] and is a is a tariff really worse than
[79:31] income tax or we going to see some
[79:33] change there. Uh we can think about
[79:35] whether manufacturing really has um some
[79:38] kind of external benefits that's going
[79:40] to make it a better type of job for
[79:42] Americans or especially low-skilled
[79:44] workers to have. Um but I think a lot of
[79:47] it is is partly just political and that
[79:50] gets left out of the economic
[79:52] conversation about tariffs. Economists
[79:53] always just want to keep this strictly
[79:56] about um the areas that they know about.
[79:59] But I think, you know, part of Trump's
[80:01] reasoning has nothing to do with
[80:02] economics. Part of it is as um as Josh
[80:05] mentioned before, you know, some of
[80:07] Trump's adviserss are are think are want
[80:09] to rethink the global order in terms of
[80:11] international trade and finance. We
[80:13] don't know exactly what their ultimate
[80:15] aim at. And so it's really really hard
[80:17] for us to think about judge the cost and
[80:19] the benefits without knowing what the
[80:22] the ultimate strategy is. And so it's a
[80:24] little bit difficult to make those kinds
[80:26] of estimates. But I think even bigger
[80:29] picture than that, a big part of Trump's
[80:32] approach is
[80:34] to get rid of people that are or or push
[80:37] back against the forces that are in the
[80:40] United States anti-American and and to
[80:43] to push a more patriotic message about
[80:46] bringing Americans together. And it may
[80:48] be that he doesn't even believe that
[80:49] we'll get benefits for manufacturing
[80:51] jobs, but making Americans work at
[80:54] something together and feel patriotic
[80:56] and believe in America rather than
[80:58] having pockets of people that hate
[81:00] America and are sharing all these like
[81:02] terrible ideas and dividing our society.
[81:05] You know, bringing people together is
[81:08] maybe the most important thing. And I
[81:09] think a lot of what Trump is trying to
[81:11] do is all part of that. and and to think
[81:15] about these individual policies um
[81:18] strictly in an economic sense or as not
[81:21] part of this uh bigger push to bring
[81:24] America together. If you if you just
[81:26] look at the policy alone, I think you
[81:27] can't understand that.
[81:30] Well, and I think too like there's a
[81:31] reason why there's a push back against
[81:33] the government, right? There's a reason
[81:34] why this is a sort of populist thing is
[81:36] that what is is that what you see is you
[81:39] know this system where you have to send
[81:40] dollars abroad leads to you know the the
[81:43] dollar being overvalued for longer
[81:45] periods of time than than maybe it would
[81:47] be otherwise. And the thing is is if the
[81:49] dollar becomes sufficiently overvalued
[81:51] well then it makes sense to move
[81:52] production uh someplace else because now
[81:55] things uh become a lot cheaper. And so
[81:59] when if you're if you're living in these
[82:01] towns and your factory leaves because um
[82:05] it's now cheaper to to produce the stuff
[82:06] in China or Vietnam or wherever they're
[82:08] going um you very that's a that's a seen
[82:12] cost like you observe that cost and you
[82:14] associate that with US trade policies
[82:17] right and so you're looking at that and
[82:19] you're seeing that but then on the other
[82:21] and and then what you're told though is
[82:23] is that um uh the the messaging from
[82:26] politicians for a long time is look this
[82:28] is just comparative advantage. we just
[82:30] go to the you know like production goes
[82:32] to where the cost is the lowest and this
[82:34] is just comparative advantage and we
[82:36] don't really have to compensate like you
[82:38] know um the losers from from trade right
[82:41] and I think this is I think this is an
[82:43] important point because if you teach
[82:45] international
[82:46] trade what you teach is that yes
[82:48] international trade makes us all
[82:50] collectively better off right just in
[82:53] the same way that just local trade makes
[82:55] us better off right specialization and
[82:58] trade make us better off. The issue is
[83:01] is that when you go from a world u when
[83:04] you have a policy change that changes
[83:06] the relative cost of trade, well, that's
[83:08] a deliberate action that you've taken,
[83:10] right? And so when people see that
[83:12] there's this deliberate action that's
[83:14] been taken, well, yes, collectively like
[83:16] that make might make us all better off,
[83:18] but one of the things that we teach is
[83:19] that there's distributional effects,
[83:21] right? And and so the the distributional
[83:22] effects of trade mean that like yes,
[83:25] collectively we're better off, but there
[83:26] are going to be people who um who win
[83:28] from from this and there are going to be
[83:30] people who lose from this. And the and
[83:32] the policy response has always been
[83:34] well, we don't need to like do anything
[83:36] to compensate the losers. They're being
[83:37] compensated with like lower prices and
[83:39] and and things like that. And first of
[83:42] all, just from a pure politics
[83:43] perspective, like that just seems like
[83:45] it's inevitably a loser, right? Like if
[83:47] if these if these changes are very small
[83:49] in magnitude, yeah, that's probably not
[83:51] something that you're going to have to
[83:52] worry about. But if you if you're seeing
[83:54] this on a much larger magnitude, well,
[83:57] people are going to start getting upset
[83:58] because you have these losers who see
[84:01] these costs, right, from these policies
[84:04] and they're looking to the winners and
[84:05] saying, "Hey, you know, you're way, you
[84:07] know, I have cheaper goods, but I also
[84:08] don't have this job anymore, right? And
[84:10] now I have a worse job and so yes,
[84:12] things are cheaper, but like you have
[84:13] the same job and things are also
[84:15] cheaper." And so like why should you get
[84:17] that benefit? And just politically I
[84:18] just think it's obvious that you're
[84:20] going to get this kind of conflict. I
[84:21] mean in fact this is how we segue from
[84:23] international trade theory to
[84:25] international trade policy when we're
[84:27] talking about this in classrooms is like
[84:29] you you hinge on this distributional
[84:31] argument and you say okay well this is
[84:33] what creates some political conflict and
[84:34] so like let's talk about the the
[84:36] policies and and things like that. So I
[84:39] think that's also an important aspect of
[84:41] this. And then on top of that, like I
[84:43] don't think that like the the the entire
[84:46] populist sentiment is driven by lots of
[84:48] different things because simultaneous to
[84:50] this, what you're also seeing is you're
[84:52] also seeing um largecale immigration in
[84:55] the United States and large-scale
[84:57] immigration that's coming with a lot of
[84:59] government
[84:59] benefits. And so when and and so when
[85:03] you look at this and you say, "Well,
[85:04] wait a minute. I can't be compensated
[85:06] from trade, but then you're going to
[85:07] compensate like these people who come
[85:09] here." it's inherently going to create
[85:11] political conflict whether you know
[85:13] whether you think that we don't need to
[85:16] worry about you know the trade or
[85:18] whether you think we don't need to worry
[85:19] about immigration or not like to to deny
[85:22] that this is going to create political
[85:23] conflict is just to not recognize
[85:25] reality right when you see groups who
[85:28] see them who who see these policies and
[85:30] say hey I'm suffering from this and
[85:32] you're not doing anything to help me and
[85:34] then you see other people who are being
[85:35] helped it's natural to say hey wait a
[85:38] minute what about me and so I think that
[85:40] the um that's something that sort of
[85:43] gets lost in all this as it relates to
[85:45] the tariffs. Yeah. I mean, I think like
[85:46] we're we're the three of us are not
[85:49] necessarily going to give you the
[85:50] typical response because the the because
[85:53] like the instinctual thing for
[85:56] economists to do is say like free trade
[85:57] is good, we shouldn't in infringe on on
[85:59] free trade, right? That um since trade
[86:02] makes us better off, restricting trade
[86:04] must make us worse off. I think there
[86:06] are a couple aspects to this that that
[86:08] are important. is that a lot of the
[86:10] arguments as as Thomas kind of alluded
[86:12] to, a lot of the arguments against
[86:13] tariffs are actually just arguments
[86:15] against taxation, right? So they just
[86:17] say, well, this distorts this and so you
[86:20] know, we don't want to do that. And it's
[86:21] like, well, any proportional tax
[86:24] distorts economic activity, right? Any
[86:27] tax um that um you know, anytime you're
[86:31] taxed for doing an activity, people are
[86:32] going to do less of that activity to
[86:34] avoid the tax. And so the idea that it's
[86:37] distortionary, that's that's not the end
[86:38] of the story. That's the start of the
[86:40] story. Like it's always the the relevant
[86:41] question in economics is always compared
[86:43] to what? And so if you were going to
[86:45] have slightly higher tariffs and
[86:46] slightly lower income taxes, that
[86:48] actually might be a win for for
[86:50] everybody, right? The other thing too is
[86:53] that getting back to the international
[86:55] monetary system when we think about the
[86:56] tariffs there is an important point that
[86:58] the Trump administration has made that I
[87:00] don't think gets enough attention which
[87:01] is the fact that since the dollar is the
[87:04] global reserve currency when the US
[87:07] government imposes tariffs on the rest
[87:10] of the world um we typically think about
[87:12] okay what's the cost in terms of the tax
[87:14] incidents right so how much does the
[87:16] price to the consumer go up and how much
[87:18] does the price to the foreign producer
[87:20] go down Right. And one aspect of this
[87:24] though is that
[87:26] um what we really need to think about
[87:28] this is in real terms, not in nominal
[87:30] terms. And so one of the things that
[87:32] that people like Steven Moran have
[87:34] pointed out is that if you look at the
[87:35] tariffs on China, for example, that the
[87:37] United States imposed uh during the
[87:39] first Trump administration,
[87:41] um yes, what happened is is that the
[87:43] goods priced in terms of yuan went up,
[87:47] right? um after these tariffs. But the
[87:50] thing is is US consumers pay for those
[87:51] things in terms of dollars. And what
[87:53] happened is is that the dollar
[87:56] appreciated after these tariffs. And the
[87:58] reason is is that when you levy these
[88:01] tariffs, the price goes up initially
[88:03] people start importing less as it that
[88:06] means fewer dollars are going abroad
[88:08] which creates an excess demand for
[88:09] dollars and so dollars become more
[88:11] valuable. And so if the price in terms
[88:14] of yuan is going up, but the um but you
[88:18] can buy more yuan with a given dollar
[88:20] than you could before, then at least
[88:23] part of that cost is being offset um by
[88:26] by that arrangement. And so that's also
[88:28] kind of a relevant question that we have
[88:29] to ask is that if if those if if those
[88:32] two forces are going to offset, then the
[88:35] the typical costs of the tariffs that we
[88:37] talk about are not going to be as are
[88:39] not going to be as large as people
[88:41] predict.
[88:42] I guess I would just um I would just
[88:45] modify one thing that Josh said in terms
[88:47] of compensating the losers. Um it's not
[88:52] that it's not that the elites haven't
[88:54] compensated the losers at all or haven't
[88:57] pursued policies to compensate the
[88:59] losers, but rather it's that many of the
[89:03] schemes that they have employed to
[89:05] compensate the losers have some pretty
[89:08] significant unintended consequences. So,
[89:11] for example, the the permanent welfare
[89:13] roles that were available in the 1980s
[89:15] and replaced by the the Clinton
[89:18] administration in the 1990s, what were
[89:20] they replaced with? Well, ostensibly
[89:24] they were replaced with a temporary
[89:25] welfare system. But there's some great
[89:27] reporting on this from Hana Jafy Waltz
[89:30] from uh NPR about a decade ago. You can
[89:33] Google it. It's called unfit to work.
[89:35] And what you see is that you get this
[89:37] massive swell in the disability
[89:40] roles. So what's happening? All right.
[89:43] So you you have put some folks out of
[89:46] work and you want to compensate them,
[89:48] but the the way that you go about
[89:51] providing a safety a social safety net
[89:54] is to condition it on being disabled.
[89:57] And the the thing is that on the margin
[90:00] there are some unclear cases. And I if
[90:03] you're if you're disabled as opposed to
[90:06] being on a on a a permanent welfare role
[90:09] that you could potentially come in and
[90:10] out of if an opportunity does emerge, if
[90:14] you see a a chance and you think maybe I
[90:17] should shoot my shot here, there's a
[90:19] pretty big downside because in acting on
[90:22] that, you reveal that you are actually
[90:24] able to work and then you can't fall
[90:27] back on that social safety net. So
[90:29] that's a big problem. And you know Josh
[90:32] was talking about the cultural stuff
[90:34] earlier but it's also worth noting that
[90:36] a lot of the assistance that we provide
[90:38] to uh you know ostensibly to families
[90:42] and and to children um is conditioned on
[90:46] whether or not those are intact
[90:48] families, whether or not they're you
[90:50] know a two a two parent home or not. um
[90:53] if you're a single parent, you can
[90:56] collect on some benefits that you
[90:57] wouldn't be able to collect on if you
[91:00] had a working spouse. And so in in some
[91:03] of these low-income communities, it's
[91:05] not um uh certainly not unheard of and
[91:09] indeed I would say not at all
[91:10] unreasonable that you have these what
[91:13] look like long-term relationships, but
[91:15] folks aren't actually married. they
[91:17] haven't actually made these real
[91:19] long-term commitments because doing so
[91:22] would be
[91:23] costly. So we, you know, these are just
[91:26] a few examples, but we have a lot of
[91:28] these these schemes to, you know, to to
[91:33] erect a social safety net that will help
[91:35] the least welloff so that when there are
[91:38] losers of trade or innovation or
[91:41] economic growth that that we can
[91:44] compensate them. But oftent times those
[91:47] those compensation schemes do harm more
[91:49] harm than good. I'll I'll give one more
[91:52] example here. If you think about the I
[91:54] mentioned the opioid epidemic earlier,
[91:56] one of the one of the big fuel to the
[91:59] fire here of the opioid epidemic is that
[92:01] this was a mechanism for very lowincome
[92:04] people to monetize their Medicare
[92:07] benefit, their their Medicaid uh
[92:09] benefits, right? That is they had access
[92:13] to basically
[92:15] close to free or free drugs, right? They
[92:19] just had to get the prescriptions. And
[92:21] once you get that, you can sell them to
[92:23] other people. And how else do you get
[92:25] that income, right? If you have
[92:28] conditioned what are essentially
[92:29] payments to very poor people on them
[92:32] getting prescriptions, well, then
[92:33] they're going to get a lot of
[92:34] prescriptions and they're going to sell
[92:36] those prescriptions to other people. So
[92:38] again, you you have tried to to help the
[92:43] least welloff, but the way you've you've
[92:45] done it is kind of hamfisted and it ends
[92:49] up making them worse off than they
[92:50] otherwise would have been. So, you know,
[92:53] I I I I don't want to say that we
[92:55] haven't tried to compensate the losers
[92:58] of trade or innovation, but but rather
[93:01] that some of the ways that we have tried
[93:04] to compensate folks have just not worked
[93:06] out very well. and and probably need a
[93:09] big rethink. Yeah, I think I think
[93:11] that's the important point because like
[93:13] what it is is what people want. What
[93:16] these people want is they want the
[93:17] dignity of work. Like that's what they
[93:20] that that's fundamentally what they
[93:21] want. They want that factory job where
[93:23] they can go make a good income and feel
[93:25] good about themselves and know that they
[93:26] produce something of value for society,
[93:29] right? And what's happening is is like
[93:31] we're giving them we're we're saying,
[93:33] "Yeah, the factory closed, but we'll
[93:34] just give you we'll just send you this
[93:36] money." So, isn't that, you know, isn't
[93:38] that uh just as good, right? Um and the
[93:41] thing is is that, you know, if you're
[93:44] just thinking about this in a pure
[93:46] economic sense, you might think that
[93:48] that's that that that's fine, right? Is
[93:49] like, oh well, you know, they they lost
[93:51] their job, they lost this money, we'll
[93:53] just send them money. But that's but you
[93:55] know, life is about more than that.
[93:57] People care about these kinds of things.
[93:59] And I think that that's what I think
[94:01] that's the thing that's really really
[94:02] hard for people to understand in our
[94:04] current political environment is that
[94:07] what what people what people really seem
[94:09] to want is they really seem to want
[94:11] these things that the government can't
[94:13] provide for for them, right? They want
[94:17] um the dignity of work. They want a
[94:19] sense of community, right? They they
[94:21] want healthy marriage markets, right?
[94:23] They that that's the things that they
[94:25] want. and they see um you know and and
[94:29] they see the government as the the
[94:31] reason that that those things uh are are
[94:34] no longer available to them. Sorry about
[94:37] your job and family. Here's some pain
[94:38] pills. You can sell them if you want to.
[94:40] We we even now we good. Yeah. I mean
[94:43] it's not it's you know it's not just
[94:45] that we're sending folks money though,
[94:47] right? It's that we're conditioning
[94:49] those payments on things like being
[94:51] disabled or not working or taking out
[94:55] prescriptions, right?
[94:58] It's if we were just sending folks
[95:00] money, right? Then they could
[95:03] potentially go get a job and have the
[95:04] dignity of work and have the money, but
[95:07] in order to get the money, you can't
[95:09] have the dignity of work. That's not
[95:11] going to work out so well. or if in
[95:13] order to have the money, you can't have
[95:15] a two parent home, that's not going to
[95:17] work out so well. So, we got to think
[95:19] carefully about what you're conditioning
[95:21] those payments
[95:23] on. Guys, this was uh I want to be
[95:26] conscious of time because I realize uh
[95:28] we we ran a bit over and I appreciate
[95:29] you guys taking the time. I could pick
[95:32] your brains for probably several more
[95:33] hours, but we may have to save it for
[95:35] another session. I I do want to give a
[95:37] shout out because as uh uh fellows of
[95:39] senior fellows of the Bitcoin Policy
[95:41] Institute, uh you all have a summit
[95:43] coming up on June 25th uh 25th and 26th
[95:47] in DC. Uh um myself and my wife are both
[95:50] going to be there. So, we're very
[95:51] excited about that. First uh first
[95:54] political summit type event uh in
[95:56] Bitcoin, unless you consider last year's
[95:57] Bitcoin conference in Nashville to be
[95:59] one as well, but uh I think this will be
[96:01] a little bit of a different vibe, but
[96:03] extremely excited for that. Uh so for
[96:04] anyone listening, go to uh bdcpolicy
[96:08] uh.org or bdcpolicsummit.org and you can
[96:11] grab tickets for that. Anywhere else you
[96:13] guys want to send people, I'll link uh
[96:15] I'll link your ex accounts, but anywhere
[96:17] else they should go if they want to uh
[96:18] either read more of your work or uh
[96:20] check out what you're doing.
[96:24] Uh we all uh write a a bit for the
[96:27] American Institute for Economic Research
[96:28] because we're fellows there. And as Will
[96:30] mentioned, he's the director of the
[96:32] Sound Money Project. Um, and yeah, we
[96:35] also write occasionally for BPI and as
[96:37] you mentioned, you know, you can find us
[96:39] on X.
[96:40] And Thomas and Josh, I think you guys
[96:42] are going to Vegas soon, right? Yes, we
[96:45] will be. We'll be speaking, right? Yeah.
[96:48] I'll I'll see you guys there then.

[97:07] again. You know, it wasn't too many
[97:08] economists. We could even bring on a
[97:10] fourth next time, I think.
[97:13] All right. We'll have to find one. Yeah.
[97:15] Yeah. Somewhere somewhere. All right.
[97:18] Thanks, guys.
