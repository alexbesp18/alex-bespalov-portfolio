[00:00] We are getting to the point where our
[00:02] society is so complex that we cannot
[00:05] allow people to be like, "Oh, central
[00:07] bankers, please make a decision on
[00:09] monetary policy, but do not enrich
[00:12] yourself." They're like, "No, no, we
[00:13] won't do it. Pinky
[00:15] promise. You will not print a trillion
[00:17] dollars, locker. You won't unless we
[00:19] have to, and we always have to." Well,
[00:21] that's that's the insane thing. Like,
[00:22] man, it's it's funny to me that people
[00:24] look at Bitcoin still and they're like,
[00:26] "Well, that's that's crazy. What do you
[00:28] mean no one's in charge?" But it's like
[00:29] once you go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole
[00:31] a bit, you look at the fiat system and
[00:32] you say, "That's crazy. Why are people
[00:34] in charge of the price of money? Why are
[00:36] these 12 dudes setting the price of
[00:38] money and they're like academics, you
[00:40] know, in nice suits? They they have this
[00:42] reputation of being knowledgeable.
[00:44] They're economists. Yes. Yes. Not not
[00:47] like you and me. We're Yeah. We're a
[00:49] bunch of internet trolls. Degenerates.
[00:52] Yeah. We don't understand it. It's it's
[00:53] above our heads. Walker. We don't have
[00:55] the necessary degrees to understand it.
[00:57] The Federal Reserve employs some like
[00:59] insanely high number of economists and
[01:02] it's like fourth and fourth all that
[01:03] they do. It's not like they employ all
[01:05] these different economists and they all
[01:06] like debate and disagree with each
[01:07] other. They just get as many economists
[01:09] as they can so that they can all agree
[01:10] and they're like, "Well, we've got
[01:11] consensus. Every every economist that
[01:14] works for us says that we need to print
[01:15] more money." So, I mean, I guess we'll
[01:17] just print more money. God bless those
[01:19] people. But you become part of the
[01:21] cancer on society.
[01:24] [Music]
[01:29] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:31] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:34] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:36] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:39] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:41] Bitcoin. And if you are listening to
[01:43] this right now, remember you are still
[01:47] early. I am back from the Bitcoin
[01:49] conference in Las Vegas. And as you can
[01:51] hear, my voice is still pretty rough
[01:53] from having way too good of a time. But
[01:55] I do just want to give a quick shout out
[01:57] to everybody who took the time to come
[01:58] up to me and say that you love the
[02:00] Bitcoin podcast or you enjoyed my
[02:02] narration of Lawrence Leard's book, The
[02:04] Big Print. It honestly means a lot to
[02:07] hear your feedback and I truly
[02:09] appreciate all of you supporting the
[02:10] show. Seriously, thank you. If you find
[02:13] the show valuable and want to support it
[02:15] with some sats, quick reminder that you
[02:17] can do so on Fountain app by boosting
[02:19] the show or becoming a paid subscriber
[02:22] or feel free to zap on noster or don't.
[02:25] Bitcoin doesn't care. This episode was a
[02:28] live stream with my uncle Rockstar at
[02:30] the Roxom booth in Vegas and I want to
[02:32] give a shout out to the Roxom crew for
[02:34] letting me use their setup so I didn't
[02:36] have to bring all of my gear to Vegas.
[02:38] As usual with my uncle Rockstar, it was
[02:40] a great rip. My only complaint is that
[02:42] it was far too short. So, I'll have to
[02:44] have him back on the show again for a
[02:45] longer rip in the near future. All
[02:48] right, that is enough from me. Without
[02:49] further ado, let's get into this Bitcoin
[02:52] talk with Rockstar
[02:59] Dev. Rockstar developer, my uncle, I am
[03:04] Walker America. Both of those are our
[03:06] real names. And here we are. Here we are
[03:09] at the Bitcoin conference. We are in
[03:11] beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada, Sin City.
[03:15] What a time to be alive. How are you, my
[03:16] uncle? Crazy, man. You see that? Uh we
[03:20] we just actually just looked that Dorsy
[03:23] tweeted out that now on Square Terminals
[03:26] you can accept Bitcoin. And this is what
[03:29] I've been working on, man. Now this card
[03:31] of mine that has Yeah. Show show the
[03:34] camera maybe so they can see how how
[03:36] awesome this is. So that has laser eyes,
[03:39] right? Incredible. I can actually go to
[03:42] the terminal and pay with this. Isn't
[03:44] that crazy? Like with with this Bitcoin,
[03:47] I just go and like tap to pay. Here's
[03:49] what I love about this because I feel
[03:51] like there's this ongoing narrative or I
[03:54] shouldn't say nar maybe argument about,
[03:55] oh, you know, never sell your Bitcoin
[03:57] or, you know, you don't actually need to
[03:59] use Bitcoin as money because using it as
[04:00] a store of value is is good enough. you
[04:03] obviously have a different opinion on
[04:05] the matter and are actively working on
[04:07] things that uh make it very easy to use
[04:10] as money as easy as using your card. So
[04:11] can we like can we talk about this?
[04:12] First of all, what what what is this
[04:13] card for people who don't know? I also
[04:15] want to talk it from a perspective I
[04:17] understand. Yeah. Not everyone is an
[04:19] altruistic idiot like myself, right? So
[04:23] you spend years developing false
[04:25] software while you could have just uh
[04:28] you know amassed Bitcoin didn't do
[04:31] anything you're up in profits that's it
[04:34] but the thing is PE when people say
[04:36] don't spend your Bitcoin spend fiat
[04:39] actually I see the technical way of how
[04:42] to do that because you can keep your
[04:45] Bitcoin now you we're getting to the
[04:48] point where you can literally
[04:50] borrow against it in infinitely. And as
[04:55] you're doing that, you have dollar
[04:57] balances backed by Bitcoin. And then you
[05:00] can use cards like this that are
[05:02] essentially just authentication key that
[05:05] sends a signal to server transmit this
[05:08] much like uh pay this lightning invoice
[05:11] authorized and and that's all that this
[05:14] is. I uh what I love about uh situation
[05:18] now is now that Square rolls this out.
[05:21] Mhm. Man, you have a lightning node
[05:23] running. Yep. You tie it to bolt cards.
[05:26] You're paying from your lightning node
[05:27] to square. Isn't it insane? And I It's
[05:30] incredible. I don't even want to get in
[05:32] the whole KYC no KYC. I I think I spoke
[05:37] with Sailor about his bold card that's
[05:40] coming at the conference. So, uh it will
[05:43] be at official conference store
[05:45] releasing tomorrow morning. like I'll
[05:48] I'll uh see if Michael can get his card
[05:52] and use it to pay with Bitcoin and we
[05:56] can set it up so he's spending dollars
[05:58] actually. So So all good, Michael. We
[06:00] you know I mean and either way if he's
[06:02] not spending his Bitcoin maybe
[06:03] presumably he's good with it, right?
[06:05] Well, I mean he's spending Coinbase's
[06:06] Bitcoin, right? There we go. Yeah. But
[06:10] to me, man, that's okay. If you want to
[06:12] have a custodian
[06:14] and you want someone to be responsible,
[06:17] someone you can pressure, okay, that's a
[06:21] bank, but you come tap to pay. Done. I
[06:25] love these cards because I think one of
[06:26] the things that was always uh always
[06:29] hard for people when it comes to
[06:30] understanding Bitcoin, like I was just
[06:32] talking to uh somebody on the flight
[06:34] here to Vegas, nice gal was coming in
[06:36] for a Kenny Chzn concert. Oh my god. and
[06:39] she works as like a financial adviser
[06:41] actually and started chatting up Carl
[06:42] and I and she said you know some of my
[06:44] clients have you know asked me about
[06:45] Bitcoin I don't I don't know like I
[06:47] don't understand it I you know whatever
[06:50] and she's like you know because you
[06:51] can't touch it it's not like physical
[06:53] and and which I always think is such a a
[06:56] weird thing for people to say because
[06:57] first of all it's I was like okay you
[06:59] got cash on you or you you're using a
[07:01] credit card or a debit card debit card
[07:04] okay so so like where where is that you
[07:06] can't touch that either it's just like
[07:07] you just have this physical ical card,
[07:09] but that makes them think it's it's
[07:11] physical even though there's there's
[07:12] nothing physical about it. This is kind
[07:14] of like I feel like bridges that gap
[07:16] where people then feel, oh, now look, I
[07:19] can touch the Bitcoin, you know, like
[07:20] the bitcoins are in the card and it
[07:23] makes a difference for people. It really
[07:24] does and it's way cooler with laser eyes
[07:27] and experience. I It's so sick. I spoke
[07:30] with Odell about this and I think now
[07:33] that we will be moving from you like get
[07:36] your wallet out
[07:38] uh scan to pay, pull the we move to
[07:40] this, tap to pay. I think the ultimate
[07:43] frontier is you get this into the phone
[07:46] and then you tap and pay like with Apple
[07:49] Pay and behind all of that is Bitcoin
[07:52] settlement layer. so excited because it
[07:56] took us time man when when you look at
[07:59] mainstream media they were calling us
[08:00] out that uh look at that that there it's
[08:04] a Bitcoin conference but you can't pay
[08:06] with Bitcoin it's onchain it's 10
[08:08] minutes it's this and that sure but we
[08:11] worked on the technology for last five
[08:14] six seven you know eight years bringing
[08:18] up lightning network and now it's ready
[08:20] now it's literally you have Square like
[08:23] a company that's tens of billions of
[08:25] dollars worth rolling out like hey you
[08:28] remember you you see this that we have
[08:30] at BTC pay open source tab to pay now we
[08:33] have it as well and it's beautiful man
[08:36] to see it that Square announcement is
[08:38] honestly huge because that's something
[08:40] that is used by like so many small
[08:42] businesses especially small merchants
[08:45] you know individuals who aren't running
[08:46] some big enterprise and maybe you know
[08:48] couldn't pay for whatever expensive POS
[08:50] software and hardware terminals were
[08:52] were out there and Square filled like a
[08:55] definite need for them. Now they're
[08:56] coming in and across all of the I don't
[08:59] know how many how many merchant users
[09:01] they have, but it's a mass it's a an
[09:03] insane number. Now anyone can pay with
[09:05] Bitcoin at those and I feel like that
[09:07] that just breaks down so many walls that
[09:10] were up there before where it was really
[09:11] easy to say, well, okay, if you know the
[09:13] classic argument, if Bitcoin's money,
[09:15] then why can't we spend it anywhere? And
[09:18] you know, speaking of people who say
[09:19] that, I see Peter Schiff walking by
[09:21] right now. Maybe maybe he'll stop in.
[09:24] We'll see. Gold is old, Peter. Gold is
[09:27] old. No, no, he's ignoring. He's a man
[09:30] on a mission. A very cool shirt, though.
[09:32] Very cool shirt. I'll give him that.
[09:34] But, you know, they takes away those
[09:35] arguments where you say, "Well, why
[09:36] can't I spend it anywhere?" And it's
[09:38] like, now now you can spend it anywhere.
[09:39] And one thing, all of these merchants
[09:42] are now stacking sets. Mhm. Right. as
[09:45] you're like a mom and pop shop that's
[09:48] that's moving to Bitcoin standard and
[09:50] suddenly your purchasing power is
[09:53] increasing over the the the time. It's
[09:55] no longer because we say like Bitcoin is
[09:58] not get quick rich scheme. It's don't
[10:01] get poor slowly scheme because and
[10:04] Sailor has that. The people that use
[10:06] fiat currencies as money, we call them
[10:09] poor. It's just you're diluted every
[10:11] day, man. It is it is a it is a great
[10:13] quote. Yeah. and uh made it into a
[10:15] really banger uh banger house track too
[10:18] as well. It's it's a great it's a great
[10:20] sample remix. We need to add this to the
[10:22] video. Yeah, absolutely. So, now you've
[10:25] got the ability to use these cards. Can
[10:26] for anybody maybe can you give the the
[10:28] highlevel uh technical of like how that
[10:31] actually work without like like this
[10:33] this is a b a bolt card. Who cares? Like
[10:35] you you mean like two developers out of
[10:38] every Okay. So, okay. I'll tell the
[10:41] point it works. Yeah. But anyone that
[10:43] wants to replicate this setup, install
[10:46] BTC pay server. Uh Nicholas Dorier,
[10:50] Emperor Nicholas, uh who founded BTC pay
[10:53] server, he created this bold card bank
[10:55] plugin. So if you want to on board your
[10:59] family on uh Bitcoin standard, you get
[11:02] these bolt cards. You give everyone
[11:04] allowance like this card is 20,000 sats
[11:08] or 20,000 bitcoins. We won't know soon.
[11:11] Walker like rename Satoshi. We might
[11:13] have to get into that a little bit.
[11:15] Yeah. But the thing is you get like five
[11:17] of these cards, you have five members of
[11:19] your family. Go like spend go buy uh
[11:23] stake and shake tap to pay Bitcoin
[11:27] standard and we get corporations to
[11:29] stack SATs as well. And I'm telling you,
[11:31] man, this as Pomp says rocket ship is is
[11:35] leaving man. It's this time. Yeah. For
[11:38] real. It's actually I want to sidebar
[11:41] quick to the Steak and Shake thing
[11:42] because I think this is honestly like
[11:44] inc like first of all it's cool. Um I I
[11:47] enjoy Steak and Shake. I enjoyed them
[11:48] even more when they put tallow uh on
[11:51] instead of every like incredible
[11:54] incredible. Uh, and then now they have
[11:57] integrated Bitcoin where you can like I
[11:58] literally went and I I bought a burger
[12:00] and fries and actually I got a Frisco
[12:02] melt a Frisco melt kind of guy and fries
[12:04] and and a shake, you know, and
[12:06] everything and I paid in Bitcoin and it
[12:07] was easy and it's kind of incredible
[12:09] like it's an incredible marketing tactic
[12:12] for them as well because they get so
[12:14] much free advertising now from all the
[12:17] toxic psychopaths on the internet who
[12:19] are like this is really cool. I just
[12:20] went and bought Steak and Shake with
[12:22] Bitcoin. This is a huge franchise
[12:24] nationwide. I mean, do you think we
[12:26] start to see more of this? Like as these
[12:28] like the tools have gotten better now.
[12:30] The tools have gotten way better even
[12:31] than a couple years ago. I haven't been
[12:33] in as as long as you, but like I've seen
[12:35] this progression and it's amazing. Do
[12:37] you think we start to see more of
[12:39] businesses do this? I think we're at
[12:41] the, you know, that critical point,
[12:43] critical juncture. It's literally like
[12:45] this conference, man, now that Square
[12:46] has announced. I think that's it
[12:50] because you know, you know how it is.
[12:52] You've been in Bitcoin, as you say, like
[12:54] maybe not as long as me, but you're
[12:55] getting a few years now. Yeah. You had
[12:57] the whole, "Oh, you're crypto couple.
[12:59] You're not Bitcoin couple. Everyone
[13:01] hating." And when we met at Beef Steak,
[13:04] Josh at Beef Steak, I I think I told you
[13:06] the same thing actually. But but I like
[13:09] then get telling everyone like, "Hey, it
[13:11] takes time." Yeah. Because everyone just
[13:14] like people look at this video, they say
[13:16] like, "What is this masked guy doing?"
[13:17] Mhm. But then they research, they're
[13:20] like, "Oh, oh, like these guys, they're
[13:23] like somehow improving their lives and
[13:26] getting wealthier as they do it. Like, I
[13:29] want that. I want that for me. I want
[13:31] that for my family." And I'm telling
[13:33] you, when we were memeing this, like I
[13:35] remember Bitstein uh doing the whole fix
[13:38] the money, fix the world. They're like,
[13:40] "Yeah, right." Like, "How will you fix
[13:42] it?" And we're like, "We will fix it. We
[13:44] will fix the money with Bitcoin. We'll
[13:46] fix the world." They're like, "Yeah,
[13:47] right." Like bunch of freaks online,
[13:50] like geeks. But now people are like,
[13:52] "Oh, they're actually doing it. They're
[13:54] fixing money. It's fixing food supply
[13:57] cuz seed oils poison. It's just you you
[14:03] get all the the bloating, mitochondria.
[14:05] You know, probably better than me. I
[14:07] just stuffing yourself full of an
[14:09] industrial lubricant basically that was
[14:10] packaged as some somehow a food. I
[14:13] watched Yeah. your videos. I I like
[14:15] followed your post and I'm like, "Okay,
[14:17] let me try not to eat like seed oils."
[14:21] Then I'm like, "Oh, actually, I feel,
[14:23] you know, less like bloated and and all
[14:26] of that." Like, it's almost like you're
[14:28] you're you're having infection, man.
[14:30] Like, I don't know how how to explain
[14:32] it. It's a It's a fiat infection really.
[14:34] It's like something that's that's
[14:35] totally avoidable and should never have
[14:37] happened, but somehow because of this
[14:39] fiat system that we live in where
[14:41] everything needs to, you know, you got
[14:42] to hide the inflation by making stuff.
[14:45] Metabolism slows down. Yeah. It's like
[14:48] it's like and then it's amazing to see
[14:51] it is a company do that though to say no
[14:53] no no seed oils anymore. Like we're not
[14:55] going to poison our customers. That's
[14:57] great. More of that, please. But I
[14:59] understand the way that started. We were
[15:01] on fiat standard. Everything is getting
[15:03] faster. They're like, "Oh, we can save
[15:05] 10 cents if we use this oil." Now
[15:08] they're coming to senses. They're like,
[15:10] "Well, we can save 10 cents right now,
[15:13] but this person is going to get
[15:15] progressively sicker as it's getting
[15:17] full of seed oils and other not even
[15:20] seed oils, but all those extra chemicals
[15:22] they're adding to food to last longer."
[15:25] No. Improve the technology. Like I there
[15:28] is no reason for you to put preservative
[15:31] in a meat like improve say do you want
[15:34] your customers to die younger because
[15:36] then they won't be your customers
[15:37] anymore. It's going to cost you more to
[15:38] acquire new ones man. It's just okay.
[15:40] Improve the uh food uh food supply chain
[15:44] logistics. Get the fresh burgers in.
[15:46] Grill them. Eat. But we're getting
[15:49] there, man. I'm telling you. They they
[15:50] thought we're crazy, but it is. Fix the
[15:53] money. Fix the world. And we're we're
[15:54] doing it. If you're stuck spending
[15:57] dollars, at least stop earning dirty
[15:59] fiat rewards. Use Fold to earn Bitcoin
[16:02] on everyday purchases and regular
[16:05] expenses, groceries, bills, travel, home

[19:09] So, thank you. I think that now that
[19:11] it's kind of interesting so where we're
[19:12] at in like this particular cycle. I
[19:14] again I haven't been around for a lot of
[19:16] cycles, you know, this is kind of like
[19:18] first time seeing these things happen,
[19:20] but this is a very interesting cycle it
[19:21] appears from from what I've seen where
[19:23] you have like the institutions are
[19:25] actually here. It's not like the
[19:26] institutions are coming. It's like no,
[19:28] the institutions are here and they are
[19:29] gobbling up sats. At the same time, from
[19:32] what I've seen, retail, you know, quote,
[19:35] retail is actually not so much here yet.
[19:38] And I don't know what it takes if if
[19:40] Bitcoin's been too boring, you know,
[19:42] bouncing around above a 100,000 couck
[19:44] bucks. Somehow that's boring. But
[19:46] apparently it's too boring for most
[19:47] people to pay attention yet. I mean,
[19:49] man, I I think it is partly uh the fact
[19:52] that everyone is getting robbed. They
[19:55] you see even the dips in stock market
[19:57] and it's like hey people buy the dip and
[19:59] they're like with what? Yeah my credit
[20:02] cards are maxed out. But that's exactly
[20:05] the the system is rigged is on once you
[20:09] get to million dollars okay you're
[20:12] coasting on 10% of uh inflation that
[20:17] money printer like you're becoming
[20:18] insider hello Warren Buffett you know
[20:21] rat poison I get it like those people
[20:23] are invested in that system and that
[20:26] system got us to a point I I don't want
[20:28] to be fiat system was 100% bad it wasn't
[20:32] actually like it brought us uh ability
[20:35] to settle much faster like uh technical
[20:39] innovations like we have the the whole
[20:41] internet revolution but we are getting
[20:44] to the point where our society is so
[20:46] complex that we cannot allow uh people
[20:51] to be like oh central bankers please
[20:53] make a decision on monetary policy but
[20:56] do not enrich yourself. They're like,
[20:57] "No, no, we won't do it." Like, pinky
[21:00] promise.
[21:02] Like, you will not print a trillion
[21:04] dollars. Walker, what you want? Unless
[21:06] we have to and and and we always have
[21:08] to. Well, that's that's the insane
[21:10] thing. Like, man, it's it's funny to me
[21:11] that people look at Bitcoin still and
[21:13] they're like, "Well, that's that's
[21:15] crazy. What do you mean no one's in
[21:16] charge?" But it's like once you go down
[21:18] the Bitcoin rabbit hole a bit, but you
[21:19] look at the fiat system and you say,
[21:21] "That's crazy. Why are people in charge
[21:23] of the price of money? Why are these 12
[21:25] dudes?" and and they like setting the
[21:27] price of money and they're like
[21:28] academics, you know, in nice suits. They
[21:31] they have this reputation of being
[21:32] knowledgeable. They're economists. Yes.
[21:35] Yes. Not not like you and me. We're
[21:38] Yeah. We're a bunch of internet trolls,
[21:40] degenerates. Yeah. We don't understand
[21:42] it. It's it's above our heads. Walker,
[21:44] we don't have the necessary degrees to
[21:46] understand it. And then that's the this
[21:48] is a total sidebar, but the Federal
[21:50] Reserve employs some in like insanely
[21:53] high number of economists. And it's
[21:55] important to work. All that they do,
[21:56] it's not like they employ all these
[21:58] different economists and they all like
[21:59] debate and disagree with each other.
[22:00] They just get as many economists as they
[22:02] can so that they can all agree and
[22:03] they're like, "Well, we've got
[22:04] consensus. Every every economist that
[22:07] works for us says it. We need to print
[22:08] more money." So, I mean, I guess we'll
[22:10] just print more money. God bless those
[22:12] people, but you you you become part of
[22:14] the cancer on society. and and
[22:17] um maybe I'm too harsh but yeah imagine
[22:20] like you listen you got to go to work
[22:23] you got to provide for your family but
[22:26] at this point you got to be like okay
[22:28] I'm part of the system that's wrong it's
[22:31] just it's wrong if I because when you're
[22:35] part also big companies not even Fed but
[22:37] big companies and you're like doing
[22:40] those meetings and everyone is smiling
[22:42] and you're like pushing the envelope
[22:46] you know you you can do better and and
[22:48] these people like printing money then
[22:51] distributing it around the world to
[22:54] NOS's Soros Bill Gates Bill Gates he's
[22:58] going to fix everything we just need to
[23:00] trust him man so but no it's it's just
[23:03] system is bad like the I wish Bill Gates
[23:06] man would be just like okay everyone is
[23:09] yelling at me I must be doing something
[23:12] wrong right but these
[23:14] psychopaths. They're like, "Everyone is
[23:16] yelling at me. I misunderstood. They
[23:18] just they just don't get it. I I I need
[23:20] to help the the the poor out there.
[23:23] They're just too stupid to understand
[23:25] that what I'm what I'm doing, you know,
[23:27] is really for their best interest cuz
[23:29] they don't know any better. Little
[23:30] simpletons." Yeah. It it's it's a very
[23:33] condescending uh condescending attitude
[23:36] that is perpetuated by some of these
[23:38] guys that are at the very tippy top. I
[23:41] think it's a corruption, man. And it's
[23:42] just your your brain becomes corrupted
[23:44] into thinking you're going to save Yeah.
[23:47] save your world. Yes. Yeah. And and then
[23:51] Well, luckily we have Bitcoin. So, you
[23:54] just stay humble. Stack SS. Now, if you
[23:56] Square Merchant, we want you in Bitcoin.
[23:59] Enable Bitcoin payment. Stack SS and uh
[24:03] let the fiat system show its its way
[24:06] out. Because, man, I also love that
[24:08] politicians are now sing. So, we can do
[24:10] more like this. not serious interviews.
[24:13] We just have fun while they do like all
[24:15] the serious stuff. Bitcoin, you know,
[24:18] it's it's kind of funny like I think
[24:20] sometimes Bitcoiners forget that like
[24:22] we're at this stage right now where we
[24:24] don't have to suck up to politicians.
[24:26] The politicians are trying to suck up to
[24:28] us. They're also realizing that
[24:30] Bitcoiners are this growing cohort that
[24:33] has a like a growing amount of wealth.
[24:36] First, we're also incredible memers. So
[24:38] they like they need our mimemetic energy
[24:40] as well as our economic energy. And me
[24:42] and Walker, we have zero Bitcoin. I I
[24:44] lost all of mine gambling in we're here
[24:46] in Las Vegas. Yeah. Zero. It's it's very
[24:49] sad. I'm going to have to start from
[24:50] scratch, but I I'll build up sat by sat,
[24:52] you know. Yeah. Step by step. But no,
[24:54] we're we're at like politicians are at
[24:56] the Bitcoin conference again for it's
[24:58] been multiple years in a row and they
[25:00] are actively trying to say like why am I
[25:02] a politician that is pro Bitcoin?
[25:04] They're fighting over themselves to
[25:06] prove who is more pro- Bitcoin, who has,
[25:08] you know, and it's Republicans and
[25:10] Democrats both. Maybe more Republicans
[25:12] now, but like the Democrats are catching
[25:14] on. Are catching up because you you saw
[25:16] last year at the Bitcoin conference how
[25:19] much money was raised for Trump by
[25:22] Bitcoin. And I posted back then it's
[25:25] just just I post and then people are
[25:27] like, "Oh, you know, this not serious
[25:28] person." But I said like if you're a
[25:32] politician, if you're a politician, like
[25:35] support Bitcoin and you will be
[25:37] supported to
[25:39] win. And if you go against Bitcoin, you
[25:43] will lose. And I tell to people, Trump
[25:47] won because of Bitcoin. Or they say like
[25:50] crypto vote, they always try to get in
[25:52] the [ __ ] coiners. But the thing is if
[25:54] people don't believe that Trump won
[25:56] because of Bitcoin, even those people
[25:59] believe that Camala lost because of
[26:02] Bitcoin, because of Operation
[26:04] Chokepoint, because they alienated the
[26:07] whole industry, that then 95% went Trump
[26:11] donations. The only one that chose the
[26:14] wrong side were Ripple. And now they're
[26:16] coming and they're like, "Please take us
[26:18] take us in. We're like, we want to
[26:20] help," blah blah. But even then, they're
[26:22] like, "Yeah." Wait, did you see the
[26:24] thing? This was actually hilarious. Uh
[26:26] that Brad Garlinghouse, uh you know,
[26:29] chief executive shitcoiner uh of of
[26:32] Ripple. We love you, Brad. Oh, you
[26:35] you're such a meme. You uh Yeah, you are
[26:37] hilarious. Uh but he he posted like,
[26:40] "Oh, I tried to meet with Senator Lumis,
[26:42] but she uh she declined my meeting and
[26:44] like won't answer my calls and refuses
[26:45] to meet with me." And I'm like, "Such a
[26:47] [ __ ] going on." That's right, man. That
[26:48] but that's that's amazing though that
[26:50] even the the toxic maximalism is
[26:53] bleeding into politics. They're
[26:56] politicians are realizing at least some
[26:57] of them don't have time to deal with
[26:59] scammers like come on man like stop
[27:01] doing that that that stuff like we don't
[27:03] meet okay do better but no they go he
[27:06] goes online and cries oh trying to throw
[27:10] senator under but like come on okay will
[27:12] she meet with you now yeah definitely
[27:14] like like never and and you look you
[27:17] look very weak I'll I'll see you there
[27:19] I'll see you there oh man it is
[27:21] incredible to see this this vibe shift
[27:23] even with the okay the strategic Bitcoin
[27:25] Reserve. Uh, you know, this idea, it's
[27:28] it's contentious. I think that I'm of
[27:29] the opinion that this was an inevitable
[27:32] result of Bitcoin succeeding. Like, of
[27:34] course, governments will want to hold
[27:35] it. This is not me saying I I approve or
[27:38] disapprove. I'm just saying I think this
[27:39] was inevitable, right? Of course. Like,
[27:42] why why if if Bitcoin is the best money,
[27:45] why wouldn't governments and
[27:46] corporations want to hold it? They'd be
[27:47] stupid not to. That said, I think it's
[27:50] very interesting that a lot of this
[27:51] toxic maximalism has actually bled into
[27:54] the regulations that there or the, you
[27:56] know, executive orders that came out.
[27:58] Yeah, we're going to uh hold the Bitcoin
[28:00] we have, not sell it and try to acquire
[28:02] more. This is what the executive order
[28:03] said. Uh in terms of the crypto, the
[28:05] digital asset stockpile, the non-
[28:07] Bitcoin, uh we will uh probably sell it
[28:10] and we're not going to acquire more.
[28:12] Like it's two completely diametrically
[28:15] opposed treatments of these things. And
[28:18] it's like as far as like from a
[28:19] maximalist perspective, it's like
[28:20] amazing, you know. No, no, but but but
[28:23] then again, the president also launched
[28:24] a shitcoin. So, but but that's the thing
[28:26] is I wish around that Trump had better
[28:31] advisers and had his own because your
[28:34] reputation is just not worth it in the
[28:36] long run. like two things. Safedine with
[28:39] his
[28:40] work amazing work that it shows that
[28:44] hardest money always wins like there is
[28:48] no oh this will be number one money and
[28:51] number two three four like 15. It's like
[28:53] you always want to be holding the
[28:56] hardest money. So and then you you you
[28:59] held gold. Gold was the hardest money
[29:01] the best technology that was available
[29:02] to us. Great. Did silver people come in?
[29:05] They're like silver is better. It's like
[29:07] no it's not. And you can argue with
[29:10] those people. However, that is the same
[29:13] and uh uh the same situation. Like you
[29:16] have Bitcoin and you have silver people
[29:19] like the these shitcoiners there's
[29:22] silver people like gold people
[29:24] understand this. So hardest money always
[29:26] wins. And number two toxic Bitcoin
[29:30] maximalists. the the term was coined by
[29:33] Vitilik Bhutaran who as a you know
[29:37] derogatory term to like show all these
[29:40] crazy people that are not reasonable
[29:43] they're too stupid to understand my
[29:45] technical
[29:46] genius 10 years have passed right since
[29:49] Ethereum more than 10 since Ethereum was
[29:52] out last month Vitalic comes and says
[29:55] hey uh we should be more like Bitcoin
[29:59] dude we've been telling you for 10
[30:01] years. You took so many people in the
[30:04] wrong direction.
[30:07] You made bunch of money. Great. Great
[30:09] for you. You know, you and your
[30:10] insiders, you keep dumping on retail.
[30:14] Great. But you know, the the whole thing
[30:17] and American Hodddle has the way better
[30:18] video. He's a toxic maximalist la. They
[30:21] cry. Sure. I mean, the best thing about
[30:24] Bitcoin is you believe in it. You hold
[30:27] it. You don't need anyone else. When
[30:30] people start asking you, you answer
[30:33] questions. When you do when someone asks
[30:36] you five times, you play Walker's video
[30:39] of sailor
[30:41] thing and and that's it. It's just like
[30:44] focus on yourself. Focus on your loved
[30:46] ones, people that you care about. You
[30:49] know, someone asked me about Bitcoin.
[30:51] I'm like, it's a scam. Don't buy it. I
[30:53] called Walker. We talked. So, yeah, have
[30:55] fun. Uh, Sidebar, did you hear that
[30:58] American Odel is running for president
[31:00] of the United States? That this is just
[31:02] what I hear. This is the This is the
[31:04] word on the street. I don't know. Oh, I
[31:06] I don't know. Listen, I I don't vote,
[31:09] but if he truly like gets a ticket,
[31:13] I would vote. I hear I hear it's the the
[31:15] American Eric Kasein ticket. That's
[31:17] that's what I'm hearing. Oh my god. I'm
[31:19] like I'm voting definitely. It's the
[31:21] most based ticket of all time. I mean,
[31:23] that's what I hear. Listen, Eric Eric is
[31:26] just special. He is a master shaman.
[31:30] That's that's how I address him. And
[31:32] then he is because he's unapologetically
[31:35] himself. He I think he also carries a
[31:38] little bit of guilt because he's like,
[31:40] "Why me? Why did Bitcoin pick me with
[31:46] all this burden and like got me to the
[31:49] point where I'm set and I can just focus
[31:51] on philosophy?" And I think he's trying
[31:53] to deliver, but man, I think he's going
[31:55] to make a great vice president, you
[31:57] know, really great. I I don't vote, but
[31:59] I would vote for that ticket. So, Huddle
[32:02] Kase, you have my vote. I can't believe
[32:05] I will be voting, man. I'll be getting
[32:06] all those scammy like like, "Oh, you
[32:08] need to be part of the jury thing." Oh,
[32:10] man. That's how they get you. That it is
[32:12] a trap. Yes. So, I would I would
[32:15] sacrifice myself that much for you too
[32:17] if you if you go on ticket. You heard it
[32:19] here first. The American hodel Eric case
[32:21] and ticket. Also, I do I do still say
[32:23] Hodel. We don't have to get into that
[32:24] now. Uh,
[32:27] but I should pronounce American
[32:28] Hodddle's name as he pronounces it.
[32:30] Just, you know, that's what he
[32:31] identifies as. As as an American
[32:33] hodddle, what are his pronouns? Uh,
[32:36] yeah, I think his pronouns are American
[32:38] and Hodddle. Yeah.
[32:40] 615. Yeah. You know, that turned out to
[32:44] be pretty darn good advice. Uh, yeah. I
[32:47] I mean that guy can meme. The the
[32:49] funniest things when when girls started
[32:50] approaching me at the conferences and
[32:52] they're like, "Do you have 615?" I'm
[32:54] like I I I didn't like understand. It
[32:58] took me like 3 months to to figure it
[33:00] out. Like so so stop doing that, girls.
[33:03] Don't don't approach that. So Oh, man.
[33:06] You know, it's it's amazing. I mean,
[33:08] we're at the we're at this point where
[33:10] like again, I haven't been in Bitcoin
[33:12] that that long. It's, you know, a few
[33:14] few years now, which is cool. Time
[33:16] flies, but it I don't know when you're
[33:19] having fun. Yeah. But the other thing is
[33:20] it it still feels it feels early, I
[33:24] think, to those of us who are watching
[33:26] like in the space watching this happen.
[33:28] But to people who are maybe just like
[33:31] hearing about Bitcoin because it starts
[33:32] pumping again. They see the price tag
[33:34] and they start saying, "Oh, I must be
[33:36] late." You know, I I must be late. You
[33:39] know, and obviously a lot of them may
[33:41] not know that you can buy a, you know, a
[33:42] fraction of a Bitcoin called a Satoshi.
[33:44] like you can you can buy a dollars worth
[33:46] of Bitcoin or a couple cents worth of
[33:47] Bitcoin. Like that's that's amazing. But
[33:50] they may not know that. But I'm curious,
[33:53] you know, do you think like are we going
[33:57] to have just another shitcoin cycle
[33:59] because now the price of Bitcoin is so
[34:00] high and every like does this just keep
[34:02] repeating itself forever? Like this is
[34:03] what I want to know. Do shitcoins
[34:05] eventually all die out or do shitcoins
[34:06] just keep coming and scamming new people
[34:09] over and over and over again forever
[34:10] forever. Forever. Sad though. Yeah, but
[34:14] that's why why money exists. Uh it's
[34:16] it's a tool for truth because you know,
[34:20] oh Walker, we're buddies. Do this for
[34:23] me. You're like, okay. I'm like, hey,
[34:25] Walker, we're buddies. Do this for me.
[34:27] You're like, okay. Sorry, I just saw
[34:29] Tatum turn. Tatum. Yeah. He's like,
[34:31] "Hey, Walker, retweet this with You're
[34:33] like, "Okay, man." Like $5, $10. Like
[34:36] you you switch the relationship to be
[34:40] like, it's a like lightning channel. You
[34:42] got to be settled. It can't I can't be
[34:44] the psychopath that's constantly
[34:47] demanding things for you. And if I do
[34:49] that, got to pay you. So money is a tool
[34:52] for truth when it's used. Well, I love
[34:56] how popular you are, Uncle. It's a It's
[34:57] amazing, you know, for a man who doesn't
[34:59] show his face.
[35:01] Everybody knows Uncle. Yeah. But I'm
[35:03] telling you, man. Uh if there is uh
[35:06] there is a better coin,
[35:09] we will all be in it. But until then,
[35:12] We're we're we're good for 100 years.
[35:13] Didn't you hear actually XRP is better
[35:16] than Bitcoin? So, I guess I guess guess
[35:17] we're all switching over. Oh, crazy. It
[35:20] it is it is ridiculous though. I mean, I
[35:23] guess like I guess in you know, scammers
[35:25] are going to scam, right? And that's why
[35:27] like that's why Bitcoin education is
[35:28] also so important because if you get to
[35:30] people like most people go through a
[35:32] little bit of a shitcoiny phase because
[35:33] they get distracted by the bright lights
[35:35] and the flashy marketing and and some
[35:38] jackass influencer who tells them that
[35:39] you know XRP is going to $100. No it's
[35:42] not. No it's not like they're they're
[35:44] dumping it on you like who you're buying
[35:46] it from Ripple also and and they are
[35:48] just going to keep dumping on you. Yeah.
[35:49] But like eventually maybe a lot of us
[35:52] need to shitcoin a little bit and get
[35:54] burned before we go into Bitcoin and
[35:56] say, "Okay, now I'm, you know, I'm all
[35:58] in. I don't want to get burned anymore.
[36:00] I want to just save the value of my hard
[36:02] work. I want to save my time and my
[36:03] energy in something that can't be
[36:05] corrupted by some, you know, jackass
[36:07] crypto crypto founder and a bunch of
[36:10] VCs." Like, I I think you literally
[36:13] opened with a question. We went through
[36:15] the whole arc like, "Don't buy Bitcoin.
[36:18] It's a scam. buy whatever and then after
[36:21] five years you will be like oh I wish I
[36:23] actually listened to these guys. They
[36:26] they actually they they actually had
[36:28] nothing to gain. They only had to lose
[36:30] because less sats for them. I know but
[36:33] Oh, speaking of sats, where do you sit
[36:35] on the sats versus bits versus bit just
[36:38] calling sats bitcoin debate? Where where
[36:40] are you at with this? I like I like sats
[36:42] personally, man. I think people are I
[36:45] see the whole thing that we need to
[36:47] rename SATs into bitcoins. I see it as a
[36:49] very condescending. It's like people are
[36:52] not smart enough. People are amazing,
[36:54] man. It's just they're under so much
[36:57] pressure with this fiat high velocity
[37:00] trash economy. You're like forced to run
[37:03] the you know hamster wheel. People are
[37:06] smart when they you just tell hey
[37:07] there's bit one bitcoin it's divisible
[37:10] in 100 million satoshi's that's it boom
[37:13] boom dollar cents but there is also the
[37:17] thing is like people that are in
[37:19] bitcoin it's a status game you know you
[37:22] become oh I am the developer that merged
[37:26] PR into bitcoin core and this is where
[37:30] power corrupts because you want that
[37:32] status you want that influence
[37:35] And maybe that's actually the biggest
[37:37] thing that I love about Bitcoin. It
[37:39] allows those people that are not status
[37:41] seeking stack
[37:43] SATs do your thing. So yeah, I'm I'm
[37:46] definitely team SATS and I think people
[37:50] that are renaming SATs into bitcoins
[37:52] that they'll be just like laughed. Maybe
[37:54] it even happens on Square Terminals.
[37:57] They they show like bitcoins. So you're
[38:00] buying for 20,000 bitcoins. Yeah. Yeah.
[38:02] Yeah. Oh boy. This is going to get
[38:04] confusing, isn't it? So, Jack Dorsey,
[38:06] you're wrong, but it's okay. We still
[38:08] love you, man. With all due respect,
[38:10] sir. With all due respect, sir, Odell is
[38:13] right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's uh
[38:16] it's like there will only be 2.1
[38:18] quadrillion bitcoins. That's How many
[38:21] zeros are in quadrillion? I don't even
[38:23] know. A lot. A lot. Like, there will
[38:25] only be 21 million mega bitcoins. A mega
[38:28] bitcoin does sound kind of cool, though.
[38:30] I I I do kind of like that. Like I like
[38:32] that idea. Ultra Bitcoin. Ultra Bitcoin.
[38:35] Ultra. Ultra mega mega premier Bitcoin.
[38:38] Right. And now we're shitcoiny. I know.
[38:40] I know that that that's the problem.
[38:42] Let's close it up. Let's close it up.
[38:44] Uncle has places to be. Uncle has place
[38:46] to be. Okay. So, uncle, if you uh if you
[38:49] had to leave people with something, and
[38:51] thank you for joining, by the way. I
[38:52] appreciate I know you're running around.
[38:54] It's it's always good to to get a
[38:55] therapy session with with my uncle. If
[38:58] you had if you had to leave people with
[38:59] something, you know, for somebody who
[39:01] stumbles across this, who is new to
[39:02] Bitcoin, maybe who sees this spectacle
[39:05] that we have here in Las Vegas and
[39:06] thinks like, what even are we dealing
[39:09] with here? What what what do you say to
[39:11] that person who just feels overwhelmed
[39:12] and like I don't even know where to
[39:14] start? Subscribe to Walker's YouTube
[39:17] channel.
[39:19] That's too No, it's we we have the best
[39:22] influencers as well. There is the whole
[39:24] joke that oh, you're doing these faces.
[39:26] do that, man. You're fighting the army
[39:28] of shitcoin influencers. Any people that
