[00:00] The way I think about Bitcoin is the
[00:02] amount of Bitcoin that I own is I have a
[00:04] share in all future human economic
[00:07] activity forever. Bitcoin is your is the
[00:10] apex
[00:11] savings vehicle in the limit
[00:14] of when bit when the whole world has
[00:17] become bitcoinized. Bitcoin is the only
[00:20] money and currency. So this is this is
[00:22] everything. This is the store of value.
[00:24] This is the medium of exchange. is the
[00:26] the representation of all the economic
[00:29] energy of everybody. And when you're in
[00:31] that scenario, the money itself is
[00:34] becoming more valuable over time through
[00:36] the efforts of the free market. I mean,
[00:38] going back to the perfect money in a
[00:40] free market, everyone's working in their
[00:42] own self-interest, but it benefits
[00:44] everybody else cuz the prices fall and
[00:46] the quality goes up and the quality of
[00:48] life for everybody increases. This is
[00:50] this is where we should be, but it's
[00:51] ultimately where we're going to go with
[00:53] Bitcoin. That process just takes a very
[00:55] long time, but we're just we're
[00:57] incredibly early. Incredibly
[01:04] early. Welcome to Saving in Bitcoin,
[01:07] your financial freedom blueprint on the
[01:10] Bitcoin podcast powered by Fold, the
[01:14] best place to buy, earn, and save in
[01:16] Bitcoin. I'm your host, Walker, and in
[01:19] this six episode limited series, I'm
[01:22] talking to some of the best minds in
[01:24] Bitcoin to walk you through the basics
[01:26] of why our money is broken, how Bitcoin
[01:30] fixes it, and how you can use Bitcoin as
[01:33] your personal financial freedom
[01:35] blueprint. Let's get
[01:42] started. Greetings and salutations and
[01:45] welcome back. Today I'm joined by Joe
[01:47] Brian. Joe spent a decade at investment
[01:50] banks before a career as an
[01:52] entrepreneur. Now he spends his time
[01:54] building and supporting Bitcoin
[01:56] businesses and he created what I
[01:59] consider to be the most impactful
[02:00] Bitcoin video of the year perhaps ever
[02:03] called What's the Problem? It will be
[02:05] linked in the show notes. I highly
[02:06] recommend you go and watch it after
[02:08] this. So Joe, welcome. Thank you so much
[02:11] for joining. Well, thank you for having
[02:13] me back, Walker. It's great to be here.
[02:16] great to have you back uh and looking
[02:18] forward to hopefully many more of these
[02:20] conversations in the years to come uh as
[02:22] Bitcoin becomes more and more ubiquitous
[02:24] in people's lives. But you know the
[02:26] point of this series is really to give
[02:28] people an introduction to Bitcoin, why
[02:30] Bitcoin matters, but also to identify
[02:33] why they need Bitcoin in the first
[02:34] place, what's broken in our current
[02:36] system, what's the problem, which it
[02:38] happens to be the name of your uh
[02:40] excellent video. So you're a perfect
[02:42] person to talk to about this. So, I want
[02:44] to start there because a lot of people
[02:46] realize the system is broken.
[02:49] Something's broken. They can feel it.
[02:51] Something's not right. They just don't
[02:52] understand why it's broken or how it
[02:55] broke. And what's the the root cause of
[02:57] this? A lot of other things get blamed
[02:59] that are really just downstream effects
[03:01] of the problem. They're not the problem
[03:04] itself. So, if we can start out with
[03:06] what is the problem?
[03:09] But the problem is that the money is not
[03:12] separated from the
[03:13] state. And so the money is
[03:16] flexible. And to sort of quote the
[03:20] video, there a big red button exists, a
[03:23] metaphorical
[03:25] abstraction of of the of the financial
[03:27] system, but a big red button exists that
[03:29] can be pressed at any point in time to
[03:31] change the money.
[03:34] And normally that's just by creating
[03:35] more of it for free for the person who
[03:38] has access to the big red button. But it
[03:40] could also be other aspects like
[03:41] changing the the level of control that
[03:45] some central parties have over someone's
[03:48] ability to use the money as well as as
[03:51] as other aspects as well. So it's the
[03:54] the lack of independence of the
[03:57] money from the
[04:00] government brackets the central banks
[04:04] I think people have this sense that like
[04:06] especially if you're uh you know in the
[04:07] the younger generations that well how
[04:10] can you even have money that's separate
[04:12] you know this this is just the way it's
[04:14] always been right I mean what do you say
[04:18] to people who just I mean like well
[04:20] what's what's the alternative what if
[04:22] the central banks and the governments
[04:24] aren't in control of this who's going to
[04:25] control it doesn't that just lead to
[04:27] chaos and everything else you know how
[04:29] can you not have somebody in control.
[04:33] Well, I think many
[04:35] people now, I mean, myself included up
[04:38] until a few years ago, you don't really
[04:40] question it. You don't really question
[04:42] money because we've been in this system
[04:44] since
[04:45] 1971. And so, if you are a productive
[04:48] person today, chances are you've never
[04:51] known anything
[04:53] else cuz you would have only been a
[04:55] child even if you hadn't retired by now
[04:57] and you wouldn't have really been aware
[04:58] of the system you're in. We've no one's
[05:00] ever known any different. And when you
[05:03] have the money that you use become easy
[05:08] and online and digits on a screen or
[05:10] notes in your
[05:12] hand and that's all you've ever known,
[05:14] you then don't really have that intimate
[05:17] connections to what the money is
[05:19] actually supposed to
[05:21] represent. Well, that money is supposed
[05:23] to actually
[05:24] be. But the notes and digits are just
[05:28] a a representation
[05:31] layer of economic
[05:34] value but linked by prior to 1971 just a
[05:39] promise and since 1971
[05:43] nothing it's just it's like having
[05:47] monopoly money and you just keep
[05:50] score. There's no link to any real world
[05:55] anchor of any form in the
[05:58] background because somebody can print
[06:00] more of it
[06:03] costlessly. And so someone can print
[06:05] more of it costlessly, it doesn't have
[06:06] an anchor anymore to anything in the
[06:09] real world. So you expending your energy
[06:12] in the real world to earn this monopoly
[06:15] paper, there's just a massive
[06:17] disconnect. It's like, why would I work
[06:19] for something that someone else can
[06:21] print for free? That's just that's just
[06:24] that's just wrong. That's structurally
[06:26] morally
[06:28] wrong. But unless you question it, it
[06:31] never even it never even comes to the
[06:34] top of your mind. But when stated like
[06:36] that, it's just so obviously
[06:39] wrong that you then hopefully go back
[06:42] and question, well, how did we get here?
[06:44] What is money supposed to be?
[06:48] And by going down that um series of
[06:52] questions, I think you you know
[06:54] inevitably only end up in one in one
[06:56] place.
[06:59] What is money supposed to be? I mean,
[07:01] you know, we're we're kind of fish
[07:03] swimming in water, you know, but when
[07:05] when you ask us what water is, we have I
[07:08] have no idea. You know, that's kind of
[07:09] that's how we are with with money,
[07:11] right? As you said, it's all we've known
[07:13] is this current system where there it's
[07:15] not, at least it's all I've known.
[07:17] There's no backing by gold. There's no
[07:19] promise of redemption for gold. There's
[07:21] nothing at all. There's and they don't
[07:23] even have to print it with a a literal
[07:25] money printer anymore. They just a few
[07:27] keystrokes and the money appears. So,
[07:31] what's what's the alternative to that?
[07:34] Can you know can we do better?
[07:36] The alternative if if you are using
[07:40] something as a representation of your of
[07:44] your economic contribution in whatever
[07:47] way that is like the value you deliver
[07:49] to somebody else or someone delivers to
[07:51] you and the money you're exchanging
[07:54] there is meant to be a representation of
[07:57] that so that you can expend your
[08:00] economic your personal economic energy
[08:02] in exchange for something that you can
[08:04] retain.
[08:06] and then spend in the future at any
[08:08] point should you wish to, but not be
[08:11] forced to. At the moment, we're forced
[08:13] to spend it
[08:16] because it's an economic battery that's
[08:18] constantly declining. I do a day's work
[08:21] today and that might buy X amount
[08:29] equal and the year after it's 10%
[08:32] smaller. it doesn't retain the economic
[08:35] energy I put
[08:36] into into earning the money in the first
[08:39] place. It's like a leaky it's like a
[08:41] leaky battery. And so when you end up in
[08:45] that scenario, your decision making
[08:48] changes. Your decision- making is
[08:50] impacted because your ability to think
[08:53] about storing that economic energy for
[08:55] some future use for saving it gets
[08:59] undermined cuz I can't put it I can't
[09:02] just leave it there for 10 years cuz
[09:04] it'd be worth half the amount. And so
[09:07] what do I do? I I bring forward my
[09:12] spending which means that you know I end
[09:15] up spending money on things that I
[09:16] wouldn't have ordinarily spent money on.
[09:20] or I speculate with it because I'm
[09:22] forced to speculate with it to try and
[09:24] recoup the amount that's being stolen
[09:26] from me through
[09:28] inflation. And so your decision-m just
[09:31] gets corrupted at the most at the most
[09:34] fundamental
[09:35] level because there's this background
[09:38] level of structural
[09:41] theft of everybody's purchasing power
[09:44] which is really just everybody's time
[09:46] and
[09:47] energy is being siphoned
[09:50] away by the money printer.
[09:55] I want to ask if if I can because I
[09:58] think people may hear you say that
[10:01] something's being stolen, right? And
[10:03] they may say, "Well, that's maybe a
[10:04] little hyperbolic. Like that's a little
[10:06] dramatic, you know. Is it really is it
[10:08] really theft?" Can you kind of uh can
[10:10] you clear that up? Why, you know, why is
[10:13] inflation theft? I thought inflation was
[10:15] just prices at the grocery store going
[10:17] up. Isn't that just inevitable? That's
[10:18] what we've been told, right? It's just
[10:20] prices always go up. That's how it
[10:21] works. Stop earning dirty fiat rewards.

[10:45] hub for spending dollars and stacking
[10:47] sats. Prices shouldn't be going up.
[10:50] Prices should be going down.
[10:52] And
[10:53] and if you watch the video within a
[10:56] minute, two minutes, you'll understand
[10:59] why this is structurally the case. And I
[11:01] know you've had Jeff on already and Jeff
[11:03] wrote a wonderful book called The Price
[11:05] of Tomorrow. And if people haven't read
[11:07] it, they should they should read it. Um
[11:09] but within 60 seconds effectively if
[11:12] you've got a if you've got perfect money
[11:15] in a free market where the perfect money
[11:17] cannot be printed for someone for free
[11:20] and it's effectively kept in
[11:23] supply then that perfect money with free
[11:26] market and human
[11:28] action causes prices to fall and quality
[11:32] to go up. And this and this is a really
[11:34] obvious example. Like if I'm if there's
[11:37] just the two of us and I was let's say
[11:41] there was hundred of us and you know
[11:44] we're trapped on an island. I'm doing
[11:46] fishing. You're cutting down trees.
[11:49] Um then because I'm specialized in doing
[11:52] that. Initially when we first landed on
[11:54] the island I was cutting down trees as
[11:56] well and you were doing the fishing but
[11:58] I'm better at fishing. You're better at
[11:59] cutting down the trees. So now we
[12:00] specialize which means we can produce
[12:02] twice the amount in half the
[12:04] time and so we can supply the needs of
[12:08] everyone from a goods perspective in
[12:10] less time or we can over supply and the
[12:13] price goes down. And so by doing that it
[12:17] increases the purchasing power of the
[12:19] free money we now have to use to
[12:21] exchange these products with each other
[12:24] in the free market because you know I
[12:26] can't build a house out of fish, right?
[12:28] I need some firewoods. that needs to
[12:30] build materials. But because there's a
[12:31] hundred of us, I'm not the only
[12:33] fisherman. You're not the only wood
[12:35] cutter. And the more time we spend on
[12:37] each of these processes, the better we
[12:38] get, the more innovative, the more
[12:40] efficient we get, and the quality of the
[12:41] output is higher. And we're competing
[12:43] with everybody else in a free market.
[12:46] And so what naturally happens over time
[12:48] is that prices continue to go down and
[12:50] quality continues to go up because
[12:51] everybody is buying, making a purchasing
[12:54] assessment on the combination of the
[12:56] two. And if you start raising your
[12:58] prices and reducing your quality, you're
[12:59] going to sell less and you're going to
[13:00] go bust, right? You're not going to make
[13:03] sales. And so this is just what happens
[13:05] in a free
[13:06] market with perfect money, which is
[13:09] totally the opposite of what we see
[13:11] today. For us, we never see prices go
[13:14] down. Prices just continue to go up. But
[13:18] that is theft on two counts really
[13:21] because it's stealing the productivity
[13:24] gains that we should be seeing.
[13:27] In our little
[13:28] example, we should be seeing prices
[13:30] going down. So, the fact that we're not
[13:33] even if even if prices were staying
[13:35] flat, something is wrong because we're
[13:38] not benefiting benefiting from the
[13:40] natural deflationary impact of
[13:42] technological innovation and human
[13:47] ingenuity, then that
[13:49] purch. The fact that prices are going up
[13:53] means that you know if the inflation is
[13:57] 2% the theft is probably 5%. It's not
[14:01] 2%. Cuz the productivity should be
[14:04] acrewing to the money. The money should
[14:05] becoming becoming more valuable and and
[14:08] lifting the quality of life for
[14:09] everybody. Everyone who has savings
[14:12] should be seeing their economic battery
[14:14] expanding over time.
[14:16] It buys more tomorrow than it does
[14:18] today, which allows you to save. It It
[14:20] then stops you having to spend it or
[14:23] speculate with it to try and retain your
[14:25] purchasing power because it does it
[14:26] naturally. That's the real state of the
[14:29] world when you don't have a central
[14:33] bank. But when you have a central bank
[14:36] that can print money for free and expand
[14:39] the balance
[14:40] sheet, it steals the purchasing power
[14:43] from everybody. And so you get you get
[14:47] this mysterious inflation which you know
[14:49] they never helpfully they never tell you
[14:51] what the real cause is. It's always this
[14:53] or it's
[14:54] that but it's a natural consequence of
[14:57] just printing more money and you know we
[15:00] can spend a couple of minutes drilling
[15:01] into why that's the case if that's
[15:03] helpful. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So when
[15:06] when the I'll use the central bank and
[15:08] the government sort of interchangeably
[15:10] here because you know I realize this is
[15:11] like an introductory episode. You've got
[15:13] you got all that excitement to come
[15:14] about understanding the network of the
[15:16] central bank, but all intents and
[15:19] purposes, central banks are mandated by
[15:21] the government and support the
[15:22] government. And so, no, no currency no
[15:25] government is ever going to go bust.
[15:27] They're just going to end up printing
[15:28] more of their own currency to pay the
[15:30] pay pay the bills that they have to pay
[15:31] in nominal terms. And so when the
[15:35] government prints more money, that money
[15:38] enters the economy, has to enter the
[15:41] economy to those connected directly or
[15:44] indirectly to the government. And so
[15:46] what you tend to see is
[15:49] um whereas in a free market only the
[15:51] only reason prices would change would be
[15:53] demand and supply based when the
[15:56] government prints this extra money and
[15:57] starts spending it into the economy on
[16:00] goods and services etc. It looks like
[16:02] demand and so the prices start going up
[16:06] but it's not extra demand it's just
[16:08] extra
[16:09] money but now you see greater levels of
[16:12] profitability of those areas of the
[16:14] economy connected to the government
[16:15] which is then a signal to everyone else
[16:17] in the market all the entrepreneurs are
[16:19] productive capital productive people
[16:21] hang on there's a demand supply
[16:22] imbalance over there and I can go and
[16:25] compete there for that
[16:28] profitability and so they get sucked
[16:30] away from the other areas of the economy
[16:33] that they're currently competing for,
[16:35] making them less
[16:37] efficient to go and compete for this
[16:40] extra free money that looks like demand
[16:42] from the government. So they're
[16:44] compromising the effectiveness of the
[16:46] economy and reducing the effectiveness
[16:48] of the economy materially. What then
[16:52] happens is the funds that have gone
[16:53] first into the pockets of the people
[16:55] connected to the government have then
[16:58] gone two ways. one, those businesses
[17:00] spend with other businesses and
[17:01] gradually business A spends, it business
[17:03] B spends in business C and gradually
[17:06] this extra money ripples out across the
[17:08] economy driving a a level of price
[17:11] increase of all the goods and services
[17:14] gradually all the inputs like the human
[17:16] cost, the raw material, they all start
[17:19] to increase which impacts every single
[17:21] business. I'll come back to that in a
[17:22] sec. The second is that those connected
[17:26] to the first ring see extra
[17:29] profitability. They now have extra money
[17:32] relative than they would have had before
[17:33] and then they invest that. This is the
[17:37] cancel on effect. So they get the money
[17:39] sooner and they often get the uh money
[17:42] on better financing terms because
[17:44] they're closer to the government. It's
[17:46] not only they get more of it, they get
[17:47] more of it at cheaper rates, which means
[17:49] investing in assets and buying property
[17:51] or acquiring businesses and these sort
[17:53] of things just becomes a much easier
[17:55] economic calculation. There's less
[17:57] downside and more upside, especially if
[18:01] they know the money's being printed
[18:03] because then they have extra very clear
[18:05] in their mind which way the asset price
[18:06] is going. And so the asset prices start
[18:09] going start going up. So we'll come back
[18:11] to the asset prices. But then for the
[18:13] for the businesses, every business is
[18:15] now faced with a
[18:17] choice like even the businesses very far
[18:20] from the money printer that don't even
[18:22] know this is happening cuz it's done
[18:25] behind the
[18:26] curtain, they start to see all their
[18:28] input costs going
[18:31] up. But now you need to charge a certain
[18:35] amount. You need to make a certain
[18:36] amount of profit if you're an
[18:37] entrepreneur to justify running a
[18:40] business. Otherwise, you just wouldn't
[18:41] run the business. And so, you need to
[18:44] reinstall your profit margin in some
[18:45] way. So, you've got you've got a couple
[18:47] of choices. The first is you pass on the
[18:50] price increase completely to the
[18:51] customer and say, "Well, my input costs
[18:54] have gone up. So, I'll just sell you the
[18:56] same product, same size, same quality.
[18:59] It's just now 10% more expensive." But
[19:01] the customer gets hurt. So, the consumer
[19:04] is worse off there. Their affordability
[19:07] has been hit because of the money
[19:08] printer.
[19:10] The second way is, well, I'm not going
[19:13] to pass on the price increase. I'll just
[19:16] shrink the product and maybe the
[19:18] consumer won't know, but it still
[19:20] impacts the consumer because they get
[19:22] less for the same amount. They just have
[19:24] to buy more of it. And so, it still
[19:26] hurts their
[19:27] affordability. But the third way is for
[19:30] businesses to say, well, I'm not going
[19:31] to change the price. I'm not going to
[19:32] change the size. I'm going to compromise
[19:35] on the quality.
[19:38] And they do this, you know, you find
[19:40] that products start breaking
[19:43] sooner. If they break soon, you got to
[19:45] buy them again sooner. Still
[19:48] inflation. It's just not in the size or
[19:51] the price. It's the it's the frequency
[19:54] with which you need to buy something or
[19:56] it's the quality that impacts you in
[20:00] other
[20:00] ways. So, you know, the quality of the
[20:02] food starts to deteriorate.
[20:05] So you go to ever cheaper ingredients
[20:07] which then starts to bring health issues
[20:10] into the population like obesity and
[20:12] these sorts of things. That's just
[20:15] inflation. That's personal inflation.
[20:18] That's like inflation
[20:21] um morphed into something else. It's
[20:24] just the money
[20:26] printer. You're being compromised by the
[20:28] money printer. And so there's these
[20:31] three levels of consumer inflation. One
[20:33] is the very visible price increase.
[20:36] Second is the sort of semi-hidden. We
[20:38] just shrink the product. And the third
[20:40] is we're going to compromise other
[20:41] things about
[20:43] you because of the money printer. Those
[20:47] are the three. There's like visible,
[20:49] semi-visible, and
[20:51] hidden. And then you have the asset
[20:53] inflation which you know drives the
[20:55] asset prices higher, drives the stock
[20:57] market higher, drives the the cost of
[21:00] housing, all the things that are in more
[21:03] limited supply than the money cuz the
[21:06] money is being printed faster than the
[21:08] things than these things are coming into
[21:10] existence. And so for people who are
[21:13] trying to
[21:14] save, you're getting squeezed from a
[21:16] cost of living perspective because your
[21:19] affordability is hit.
[21:21] Your health is being
[21:24] undermined in lots of different ways
[21:26] because of the compromise of the
[21:28] products and services you're using from
[21:31] a quality
[21:32] perspective at the same time as you're
[21:34] struggling to buy the assets cuz the
[21:36] assets are going
[21:38] up. It's like how do
[21:41] you how how can you win? You can't
[21:45] win. You can't win.
[21:47] your your income is lagging
[21:50] behind the rate of the asset
[21:54] growth and someone's constantly trying
[21:57] to pull you back by undermining your
[21:58] health as well. And so what this is a
[22:02] terrible position to be in. Absolutely
[22:05] terrible. Um but this is just the money
[22:07] printer. This is the money printer. When
[22:10] you give somebody the ability to print
[22:12] for free what you have to work
[22:15] for, it will be used and it will be used
[22:18] and it'll be used and it'll be used
[22:21] until they've consumed all the
[22:23] purchasing power of everything you've
[22:25] worked for over time.
[22:30] It's a dark picture once you start to go
[22:33] down this rabbit hole picture. I'm
[22:34] sorry. No, it's okay because this I
[22:36] think it's so important for people to
[22:37] understand and one thing I want to
[22:39] expand on a little bit there if you
[22:41] would is the the asset inflation side of
[22:43] this because people if you're a
[22:45] homeowner or if you own you know stocks
[22:49] you see asset prices going up you say
[22:52] well that's a good thing I like it I
[22:54] feel more wealthy I'm I'm I'm you know
[22:56] I'm winning this this economic game you
[22:58] know the the boomer who bought their
[23:00] house for a handful of raspberries back
[23:02] in you know 1970 Now that house is worth
[23:05] $3 million and they're like, I'm a I'm a
[23:08] genius. Every stock that, you know, the
[23:10] idea that, you know, well, stocks just
[23:12] keep going up forever, so just, you
[23:13] know, buy the S&P 500 and you'll you'll
[23:16] be great and you'll retire a
[23:18] millionaire. What are people missing
[23:21] about asset inflation? Because they
[23:22] don't I feel like most people don't tend
[23:23] to think of that as inflation. They just
[23:26] think of that as, oh, this is good. You
[23:28] know, the value of the things that I own
[23:30] is going up. What are they missing with
[23:33] that? They're missing the the value of
[23:36] the things they own is going up when
[23:41] measured in the thing that is being
[23:45] printed. So if I if I double the amount
[23:48] of money overnight in the economy, all
[23:50] the prices should be
[23:55] double. And so when you when you
[23:58] normalize the stock market performance
[24:01] or the housing
[24:03] um the cost of housing by the amount of
[24:05] dollars in existence, they haven't
[24:09] changed. They haven't changed. If you're
[24:11] if you're printing 8 to 10% extra
[24:15] dollars every year and the stock
[24:16] market's going up, surprise surprise, 8
[24:19] to 10% every year, it's just because
[24:22] they're printing more dollars.
[24:24] You're measuring it in the thing that is
[24:26] more
[24:27] plentiful. You're not becoming richer.
[24:30] The the number on a piece of paper's
[24:31] going
[24:33] up, but the value of that when you
[24:36] convert it into
[24:38] something else that can't be
[24:42] printed remains unchanged. So when you
[24:45] price these things in I mean even in
[24:47] gold, I mean gold goes up 1 to 2% a year
[24:50] and so the supply doubles every 30 40
[24:53] years.
[24:56] um they haven't outperformed those
[24:58] things. They haven't outperformed the
[25:00] things you can't print for
[25:01] free. And so it is it is just the way
[25:06] that you keep score. It's like your
[25:08] internal unit of
[25:10] account. So if your internal unit of
[25:12] account is fiat currency is the dollar,
[25:15] you feel like you're getting richer.
[25:20] But your, if you think about your wealth
[25:24] in the percentage of the pie I
[25:27] own, it's going
[25:30] down for most people, even if the number
[25:33] itself is going up. It's cuz let's say
[25:36] you have some
[25:38] savings and you earn 5% on those savings
[25:42] in some way or whatever they saving
[25:44] whatever asset class and you're making
[25:46] 5% a year. you think I'm getting
[25:50] wealthier, but if they're printing it at
[25:52] 10% a year, you're getting
[25:55] poorer. You think you're getting
[25:56] wealthier because the numbers going up,
[25:58] but the the proportion of the overall
[26:00] wealth it represents is going down. And
[26:02] so, you are becoming
[26:04] poorer. Whereas if
[26:06] you if your internal unit of account if
[26:09] the way you keep score is in something
[26:12] that cannot be
[26:15] printed then you
[26:20] realize you realize this for what it
[26:23] is is that you lose money if you're
[26:27] speculating with it. And and I I'm sort
[26:30] of dancing around it but if you're a
[26:31] unit of account is Bitcoin. If your unit
[26:34] of account is Bitcoin, that cannot be
[26:36] printed for free. There is a fixed
[26:39] supply of it
[26:41] forever.
[26:43] And instead
[26:46] of and I'll link it back to savings to
[26:50] savings here.
[26:53] Again, we all know that we can't keep
[26:55] cash in the bank as a long-term store of
[26:58] value. If you put $10,000 in the bank
[27:01] now and come back to in 10 years time,
[27:03] even with interest, you've lost money.
[27:05] You've lost purchasing power because the
[27:07] the rate of inflation outstrips your
[27:08] interest
[27:09] rate. Even the level of inflation we're
[27:12] told is correct rather than the actual
[27:14] rate of money printing. But either way,
[27:17] the the real purchasing power that has
[27:19] in 10 years time is materially
[27:22] lower. So you know you can't save it. So
[27:24] you speculate with it. You buy an asset,
[27:27] right? which puts fuel on the fire of
[27:31] the reason asset prices are going up in
[27:33] the first place for everybody else as
[27:34] well. So drives speculation, it drives
[27:36] debt, it drives leverage, all of these
[27:38] things. So you buy a
[27:41] house, you buy the stock market and it
[27:43] goes up 8 to 10% a year. Then you
[27:46] normalize it by the rate of dollars and
[27:48] you realize it hasn't changed at all.
[27:52] But if you your internal unit of account
[27:54] was
[27:55] Bitcoin, you realize you've just lost a
[27:57] load of
[28:00] money. By having my wealth stored in
[28:03] anything other than Bitcoin, I am losing
[28:07] money because my house now is worth much
[28:12] less than it was 5 years ago when
[28:14] measured in Bitcoin. So if your internal
[28:16] unit of account is
[28:19] Bitcoin, the natural conclusion is,
[28:22] well, I just shouldn't own that
[28:25] house. Why would I why would I save my
[28:28] money in a house when I could just keep
[28:32] the
[28:32] money when the house causes the amount
[28:35] of money I have to go down? You just
[28:37] wouldn't. You just keep the you just
[28:39] keep the money.
[28:41] And so what happens over time is that
[28:43] Bitcoin ends up
[28:45] demonetizing everything. So it's the
[28:48] flip side
[28:50] of what we just talked about where the
[28:52] money printer drives the inflation of
[28:55] the the
[28:58] assets. That's because you're thinking
[29:01] about them in
[29:03] dollars, but you've got the leverage and
[29:05] you've got speculation in there as well.
[29:07] So the real value of the homes and
[29:10] things is as a utility, not as a
[29:14] speculative store of value. They've
[29:16] become a store of value because the
[29:17] money is corrupted. And so they're far
[29:20] more valuable in dollars than they
[29:22] should be because a house is a
[29:25] liability. It's not it's not an
[29:29] asset. But then when you think about
[29:32] when you switch to Bitcoin, you're like,
[29:35] well, absolutely they're a liability.
[29:36] What? I don't want the house. I don't
[29:38] want that extra house. I'll sell that
[29:39] and just keep it in Bitcoin cuz I'm
[29:41] losing money by having it in the house.
[29:42] So, what happens? You sell the house and
[29:44] the house prices come back down and that
[29:47] premium for the house prices and other
[29:51] speculative proxy stores of value which
[29:54] are better than fiat currency. they
[29:56] gradually go get eroded again until they
[29:59] return to just being the utility value
[30:02] because no one buys them to store to
[30:04] store their wealth because it doesn't
[30:05] store their wealth when considered in
[30:07] Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin just gradually
[30:10] just consumes the
[30:13] monetization premium that you see all in
[30:15] all these proxy asset classes purely as
[30:18] a result of the money princes being
[30:20] there. And so Bitcoin is your is the
[30:23] apex savings
[30:29] vehicle. I mean in the limit in the
[30:33] limit
[30:34] of when bit when the whole world has
[30:37] become
[30:38] bitcoinized bitcoin is the only money
[30:41] and currency. It's the thing that we
[30:43] everybody's internal unit of account
[30:46] will be the things we will use for our
[30:49] savings and also medium of exchange
[30:53] for global value
[30:57] transfer instantly. That is the you know
[31:00] the global free market that Jeff Booth
[31:02] talks about. And in that scenario we are
[31:06] we're on the Satoshi side of the island
[31:07] in the
[31:08] video. So this is this is everything.
[31:11] This is the store of value. This is the
[31:13] medium of exchange. It's the the
[31:15] representation of all the economic
[31:18] energy of
[31:21] everybody. And when you're in that
[31:23] scenario, the money itself is becoming
[31:26] more valuable over time through the
[31:28] efforts of the free market. And we go
[31:30] back to the perfect money in a free
[31:32] market. Everyone's working in their own
[31:35] self-interest, but it benefits everybody
[31:37] else because the prices fall and the
[31:39] quality goes up.
[31:41] and the quality of life for everybody
[31:42] increases. This is this is where we
[31:44] should be, but it's ultimately where
[31:46] we're going to go with Bitcoin. That
[31:48] process just takes a very long time, but
[31:50] we're just we're incredibly early.
[31:53] Incredibly early. I want to I want to
[31:57] touch on that a little bit because I
[31:58] think especially for younger people, we
[32:01] talk about asset prices, you know, and
[32:03] you mentioned Yeah. like houses are
[32:05] great for living in, but they're
[32:07] terrible investments if you price them
[32:09] in Bitcoin. Some people have multiple
[32:11] houses, you know, that they just purely
[32:12] they live in one, they own the others
[32:14] for investment purposes. A lot of people
[32:16] that are, you know, my age, you know,
[32:19] younger, are looking at this the housing
[32:22] market and saying, I'm I'm never going
[32:24] to be able to even afford one house, you
[32:26] know, let alone enough to have uh an
[32:29] investment property house. Yeah. And I
[32:31] think they feel this, you know, you
[32:34] know, dream of owning a home slipping
[32:35] further and further away. And the reason
[32:37] it's slipping further and further away
[32:39] is because the rate of new money
[32:40] creation is also accelerating. Right?
[32:43] We've printed uh no matter what country
[32:45] you're in. Uh just during the past 5
[32:48] years, your government's central bank
[32:50] has probably printed more money than in
[32:53] the past, you know, 75 years combined,
[32:55] just in the past few years. This is
[32:58] crazy. And so it's it's this
[32:59] acceleration acceleration.
[33:02] And you mentioned also, you know, okay,
[33:04] we're still early to Bitcoin, but I
[33:05] think people look at Bitcoin now and
[33:09] they, you know, maybe they just heard
[33:11] about it now. Maybe they heard about it
[33:12] years ago when it was a couple hundred,
[33:14] a couple thousand dollars. It's now a
[33:17] lot more than that. It's got a big kind
[33:19] of scary price tag attached to it. Of
[33:21] course, you can buy fractions of a
[33:23] Bitcoin. You can buy, you know, a few
[33:24] Satoshi's. You can buy, you know, a
[33:26] dollar worth of Bitcoin. But still, you
[33:28] look at this and you say, "Come on. I
[33:30] must have missed the boat." Like this,
[33:33] you know, what is this? Can't just go up
[33:35] forever. This maybe there's some other,
[33:38] you know, uh, meme coin or some other
[33:40] speculative investment that I can look
[33:42] into because I've missed Bitcoin. What
[33:44] do you say to those people? How do you
[33:46] convince someone that we're still early
[33:48] when they see that big, you know, big
[33:51] price shock of of how high Bitcoin has
[33:54] gone? Well, I think I think that's a
[33:57] human a human reaction. If the price was
[34:01] per Satoshi, it would still feel like a
[34:03] bargain, you know, and one Bitcoin is
[34:06] 100 million
[34:07] Satoshi's. So, you can get, you know,
[34:09] almost a thousand Satoshi's for a dollar
[34:12] and price like that, it sounds sounds
[34:14] super
[34:15] cheap, right? And so, it it's just human
[34:19] frame of reference and, you know, price
[34:21] anchors.
[34:23] But I would say I'll tell you um a
[34:26] couple of things. The first the way I
[34:29] think about Bitcoin
[34:33] is the amount of Bitcoin that I own is I
[34:37] have a share in all future human
[34:42] economic activity
[34:46] forever. And I I have that
[34:50] share physically. I I have that share.
[34:53] I'm the only one who can control that
[34:55] that share. It's actually mine. It's the
[34:59] only thing in the world that you can
[35:02] actually
[35:03] own. It's like buying a share in a
[35:06] company. You might own a small share of
[35:08] Amazon or Apple
[35:09] or
[35:11] Strategy. It's just a share enforced by
[35:15] promises. You don't actually own it.
[35:18] There's nothing you can actually own.
[35:21] that nobody can take off you other than
[35:25] Bitcoin. And so framed like
[35:31] that is absolutely still a
[35:34] bargain because the the penetration of
[35:39] the the
[35:41] total value of all the Bitcoin that
[35:44] exists is circular 2 trillion dollar and
[35:48] the total asset base globally is a
[35:50] thousand trillion dollars. So it's you
[35:53] know
[35:54] 0.2% 0.2% 50% of everything that
[35:57] currently
[36:00] exists. And
[36:02] so by buying Bitcoin, I'm owning a share
[36:06] of everything forever that I can secure
[36:09] my family's future on. I can look after
[36:11] my children, my
[36:13] grandchildren, you know, I can help the
[36:15] other people I care about. I can build
[36:18] build more businesses.
[36:20] I can help drive future value of that by
[36:24] accelerating our move to a global free
[36:26] market.
[36:28] And
[36:30] it's it's Bitcoin is going to allow us
[36:34] to unlock a human
[36:37] renaissance, that sort of level of
[36:40] civilizational
[36:42] change. But it's really just not
[36:44] obvious. It's not obvious cuz it's 0.2%.
[36:48] Most people still think it's worthless.
[36:52] And so we are incredibly early,
[36:55] absolutely incredibly early. And the
[36:57] second part of your question was around
[37:00] meme coins or something like this. And
[37:03] it comes back to what we talked about
[37:04] before and that people people don't have
[37:09] a clear sense as to what money is or
[37:12] what money should represent because
[37:14] we've been disassociated from it from
[37:17] this paper layer we've been using for
[37:20] the last 50 odd years.
[37:24] The the money is meant to represent your
[37:27] economic energy, your economic
[37:29] contribution, the value you bring to
[37:32] somebody else, which you exchange for
[37:35] money so that you can then use that
[37:37] money in the future to to pay someone
[37:40] else for their contribution, right?
[37:42] That's meaningful to
[37:44] you. Fiat has broken that has broken
[37:47] that link. But before fiat, we had the
[37:50] gold standard.
[37:52] And on the gold
[37:54] standard, your fiat, your paper was
[37:57] convertible to gold underneath. Now,
[38:01] most people wouldn't have an issue with
[38:02] gold being considered valuable or gold
[38:05] being considered
[38:07] money, but gold has been money in the
[38:11] past, but it's just compromised because
[38:13] it's not
[38:14] particularly is not particularly useful
[38:17] as money. It's hard to carry around.
[38:19] It's not very divisible. you can't
[38:21] really verify whether it's real gold or
[38:22] whether it's tungsten or something like
[38:24] that very easily. Um, and you can't send
[38:27] it over the internet and you know, you
[38:30] don't want to get attacked with a wrench
[38:32] if you're carrying a big bike of gold.
[38:33] You know, it's there are lots of things
[38:35] that compromise the ability of gold to
[38:37] be used as money, but most people
[38:40] wouldn't question that it could be or
[38:43] would be perfectly fine too from a value
[38:47] perspective. And I think the link that
[38:50] people realize in their minds but
[38:52] perhaps haven't articulated is why do I
[38:55] think gold is
[38:56] valuable? And I think gold is valuable
[38:59] because a it's been valuable for a long
[39:02] time. Fair enough. But
[39:05] more more sort of deeper than that is
[39:09] that gold is hard to produce.
[39:13] It has these characteristics which are
[39:16] which make it a reasonable money like a
[39:18] compromised money but ultimately it's
[39:21] really hard to
[39:22] produce. You can't just magic it. You
[39:25] can't just print more gold. You've got
[39:27] to go and actually mine the gold. Like
[39:30] the gold exists. It's under the
[39:32] surface and there's a lot of it and it's
[39:35] infinite in the universe. But in above
[39:38] the ground, the way you produce it is by
[39:40] expending a load of energy to produce it
[39:44] or to mine it. And that's what makes it
[39:47] valuable. The combination of the energy
[39:50] expended and its limited
[39:53] supply. Now, once people realize, well,
[39:57] yes, almost like, yeah, of course, of
[40:00] course that's true. Okay. Well, I've got
[40:03] something great for you, right? Bitcoin
[40:06] is the apex energy money. Like gold is
[40:10] just really inefficient energy
[40:12] money. You spend a lot of energy getting
[40:14] out of the ground which is a sort of
[40:16] proxy for your for your economic energy
[40:18] and then people are willing to swap
[40:20] whatever they've produced for gold which
[40:23] has been brought into existence because
[40:24] you expended your energy. Like they're
[40:26] one in the same thing, right? But it was
[40:28] just really inefficient.
[40:32] Bitcoin is the is the end state. Bitcoin
[40:36] is pure energy
[40:38] money. You have to do work to bring it
[40:41] into existence. And it's through a a
[40:44] global free market process. Everybody
[40:46] globally can compete to produce the
[40:50] Bitcoin. You can't control the way the
[40:52] the rate at which it's produced and it's
[40:54] fixed over
[40:55] time. But everyone can compete. There is
[40:58] proof of
[40:59] work to bring the money into
[41:03] existence on a free market
[41:06] process. Absolutely. That makes it
[41:08] valuable. It makes it a ton more
[41:10] valuable than gold. It's not inefficient
[41:13] money. It's not hard money with soft
[41:16] edges that you know if the price goes up
[41:18] they can go and dig more out the
[41:20] ground. It's 100% efficient energy money
[41:24] with a fixed supply forever.
[41:28] And you can send it over the internet
[41:30] and nobody can stop you sending or
[41:32] receiving it. And no one can prove you
[41:34] own it or don't own it. You can carry it
[41:35] in your
[41:39] head. I mean, it's apex money. There's
[41:42] nothing there's nothing after it.
[41:44] There's nothing after it. So, if you're
[41:45] if you've convinced yourself that gold
[41:47] has value, you're going to love Bitcoin
[41:49] once you connect the dots and you frame
[41:53] that against a backdrop
[41:55] of being at 0.2% of all all assets
[41:59] globally and by owning it, you own a
[42:02] future share in all human economic
[42:04] activity forever. Like, it's a pretty
[42:07] compelling case. And you and you you
[42:12] then balance that
[42:15] against, well, I can work for something
[42:17] someone else prints for
[42:19] free and I'll keep it in a bank account
[42:22] and maybe I'm allowed to use
[42:24] it. Maybe they allow me to send it to
[42:27] that person over there. Maybe. Or maybe
[42:30] not. Or maybe they'll let me take it out
[42:32] the bank. or maybe
[42:34] not with and that that's a melting ice
[42:37] cube and it's going to go to zero
[42:38] purchasing power unless I speculate with
[42:40] it, unless I spend
[42:42] it and it's making me unhealthy and it's
[42:46] making me poorer because of all the
[42:47] secondary effects and all of these
[42:49] things. Or I can opt
[42:52] out and I can own the thing they can't
[42:55] print. I can own the thing that
[42:57] everybody's going to connect the
[42:59] dots to eventually.
[43:04] It's just there's just no contest.
[43:09] I I love the way that you framed that
[43:10] because I think this for anybody who's
[43:13] spent uh um even a just a small amount
[43:17] of time starting to look at Bitcoin, it
[43:20] maybe isn't initially self-evident
[43:22] because it's something that's totally
[43:24] new. We we've never had something like
[43:26] this that is internet native money but
[43:29] also has the uh the proof of work that
[43:31] something like gold does. We've never
[43:34] had that before. So of course it would
[43:36] be difficult to understand. Of course it
[43:38] would be hard to wrap your mind around.
[43:40] Of course your initial reaction might be
[43:43] this is too good to be true. This is a
[43:46] scam. You know this is a a Ponzi scheme.
[43:48] It's whatever uh you know uh nasty label
[43:52] you want to throw on it that's been
[43:53] thrown on it by the legacy media or by
[43:55] bankers or by politicians. You can see
[43:58] how that would be someone's reaction.
[44:01] But that's why I think it's so important
[44:02] for people and uh again I want to
[44:04] encourage them if you've made it this
[44:06] far in the video spend also go and watch
[44:08] Joe's video what's the problem? It'll be
[44:10] linked in the show notes because going
[44:13] that step deeper is I think what it
[44:15] takes because once Bitcoin clicks, once
[44:18] you realize, oh, this is the real deal.
[44:21] Oh, this is something we've never seen
[44:24] before. Oh, we are so incredibly
[44:27] early. 2% of of global uh global wealth
[44:32] and realistically probably about the
[44:34] same number of, you know, global people
[44:36] that own it. We're still below 1% both
[44:39] in its total share of wealth and in its
[44:42] share of human adoption. Yeah. That is
[44:45] insanely early. You may feel like you've
[44:48] you've missed the boat, but but you
[44:50] haven't. The boat's sitting right there
[44:51] waiting for you. You just have to get
[44:54] in. Absolutely. And and I would I think
[44:57] it's helpful for people to have sort of
[45:00] anchors of similar things they've seen
[45:01] in the past.
[45:03] And you know it's of used example in
[45:06] Bitcoin but the internet and Bitcoin you
[45:09] can think about them as sort of similar
[45:11] technological adoption
[45:15] curves and think about the ease of the
[45:20] ubiquitous nature of the internet now
[45:22] and the ease with which we can use the
[45:24] internet there's there's almost no
[45:26] barriers now everybody everywhere child
[45:30] b you know babies through to you know
[45:34] 100 year old people can safely use the
[45:36] internet and it's really user friendly
[45:38] and everyone has
[45:40] access more or less in the west and
[45:42] obviously different differs in various
[45:44] places it wasn't like that in the
[45:48] '90s in the '90s you needed a computer
[45:50] science degree to get online like it was
[45:53] it was almost impossible that if someone
[45:56] said to you then oh you know in 25 years
[45:58] 30 years time grandma over there is
[46:00] going to be on her iPad all evening
[46:03] you'd be like, "No, that's not going to
[46:05] happen." But, you know, it's
[46:08] technological adoption curves are slow
[46:11] moving. They're slow moving, but they
[46:13] get there eventually. Just everybody
[46:15] uses them. And they're slow moving from
[46:18] a combination of awareness,
[46:21] understanding, and
[46:24] usability. You need all of those
[46:28] really to be able to fulfill the
[46:30] adoption curve. But Bitcoin is still
[46:31] very early. It's only 16 years in. It's
[46:34] like the internet in the
[46:36] '9s. Like the level of, you know,
[46:39] Bitcoin does scores amazingly well when
[46:41] you think about awareness. Like most
[46:42] people have heard of Bitcoin, which is
[46:46] incredible. The fact that, you know,
[46:47] there's no, it's not a company, there's
[46:49] no marketing department, there's no CEO,
[46:51] there's nothing. This is just a optional
[46:54] network for everybody. And the fact that
[46:56] most people have heard of it is
[46:57] astounding.
[46:59] the level of understanding is very low
[47:02] and the level of uh
[47:05] usability is also very low. I know we
[47:09] haven't reached the grammar on the iPad
[47:11] stage but we will we will get there. We
[47:13] will get it presents some challenges but
[47:16] you can see them as challenges or you
[47:17] can see them as
[47:20] opportunities. You know, it's
[47:23] like telling someone about Bitcoin now
[47:26] is about telling someone about the
[47:27] internet in the 90s when you know where
[47:30] it's going to be in 2025.
[47:33] So, the takeaway should be I I really
[47:35] need to learn about that.
[47:39] It's true. I mean, the thanks to the
[47:42] internet, you have all these amazing
[47:43] ways to learn about Bitcoin, to access
[47:45] Bitcoin. This hopefully this series is
[47:48] one of those ways. Hopefully, if you've
[47:49] stumbled across this episode or any of
[47:51] the other ones, this has been something
[47:52] that's encouraged you to go deeper
[47:53] because we can't give you all the
[47:55] answers in in one hour, right? But I
[47:58] think maybe where uh I'd like to kind of
[48:00] uh just start not wrapping up, but just
[48:03] kind of uh to go like shift to a little
[48:05] bit of kind of practical moves for
[48:07] people because I think they wonder like
[48:09] where do I start? I don't you know,
[48:10] especially if you're a younger person,
[48:12] you probably don't have a lot of savings
[48:14] built up because again, the system isn't
[48:16] designed for you to save. But I mean,
[48:19] what do you what do you tell people when
[48:21] they say, "Okay, you know, how like how
[48:22] do I actually get started? Do I need to
[48:24] put everything I have into this? What
[48:25] what are my options even if like this is
[48:27] this is still kind of scary? Maybe I've
[48:29] saved up a little bit of money, but I
[48:31] like how do I do this in the, you know,
[48:34] the least scary way? What's the best way
[48:35] to actually start for people?" Yeah.
[48:38] Well, Bitcoin has always said do your
[48:40] own do your own research, you know,
[48:43] don't trust anybody. Yep. Do all us even
[48:47] not us. Not us. Just do your own do your
[48:49] own research. Learn, watch videos,
[48:51] consume content. These things are all
[48:54] free. They're all free, accessible to
[48:57] everybody.
[48:59] And conviction builds slowly over
[49:04] time. You know, you'll find every day
[49:07] that goes by, you think about it a
[49:08] little bit more, you understand it a
[49:10] little bit more. You have a higher level
[49:12] of conviction that through your own
[49:14] thought process, through your own
[49:17] critical thinking approach, you're
[49:21] closer and closer to thinking, yes, this
[49:23] is this is what I need to
[49:26] be saving in long
[49:29] term. That doesn't happen overnight. And
[49:32] it's probably going to take years to get
[49:34] to the point where, you know, probably
[49:36] took you years to to get to where you
[49:38] are now in terms of mental thinking. It
[49:40] certainly did for me. And so the way
[49:43] that I would think about buying or
[49:46] owning Bitcoin now is very different
[49:47] from a few years ago. And your your
[49:51] level of exposure and risk needs to
[49:56] match your level of conviction because
[49:57] you need to know why. You need to know
[50:00] why you own it.
[50:03] And you know, I I say quite a lot that
[50:07] I'm happy now when the price goes
[50:09] down when measured in
[50:12] dollars, which is going to sound really
[50:14] strange to people who are listening who
[50:16] still, you know, haven't gone through
[50:19] that
[50:21] um through that journey is because of
[50:24] the fact that by owning Bitcoin, I own a
[50:27] future share of everything
[50:28] forever and I'm going to be buying it
[50:30] forever. And so the price goes down just
[50:33] buy more of
[50:34] it. And there's thousands, tens,
[50:37] hundreds of thousands of people like me
[50:40] and like you there. But that's when you
[50:43] know that's when you know you've become
[50:44] a Bitcoiner by by that change because if
[50:48] you're still thinking
[50:50] about owning Bitcoin because someday you
[50:53] might be able to sell it and get more
[50:58] dollars. then it hasn't really
[51:01] clicked as to why you're saving in
[51:06] Bitcoin. It's because there'll be some
[51:08] point in the future where you don't have
[51:09] to sell the Bitcoin. You can and people
[51:12] do and you know everybody does because
[51:15] the whole point of of Bitcoin is to is
[51:18] to have that much longerterm time
[51:21] preference where you can provide for
[51:24] your family. You can upgrade your life.
[51:26] you can you can do the things that fiat
[51:29] money does not allow you to do in
[51:32] whatever way makes sense for you. And
[51:33] so, you know, we still live in the real
[51:35] world and you'll want to sell some
[51:36] occasionally to pay off the mortgage or
[51:39] send the child send your child to
[51:41] college or do something something,
[51:43] right? We no one's saying never sell it.
[51:46] I'm saying there'll be a point in time
[51:47] where you don't have
[51:49] to. In my view, Bitcoin is going to
[51:52] consume
[51:53] everything
[51:56] and but you're going to get to that
[51:57] level of conviction over time. And so
[52:00] when you're thinking about how do I get
[52:03] started, don't buy it. Don't go all in.
[52:06] Like you like you said, should you go
[52:08] all in? Absolutely not. Because you
[52:09] don't know why you own it. If it goes
[52:12] up, you'll probably sell it and get more
[52:14] dollars out. And you backed away. You
[52:16] start got more dollars. You got the same
[52:18] problem. They're still going to zero.
[52:21] or if it falls, you'll panic and you'll
[52:23] sell it. I'm never touching that
[52:26] again. And it's the one thing that can
[52:28] help
[52:29] you. And so I always say to people, just
[52:32] start start very slowly. I mean, you can
[52:36] it's a thousand thousand Satoshi's for a
[52:39] dollar pretty much. Even if you buy, you
[52:42] know, whatever makes sense for you like
[52:43] a dollar a week or a dollar a day, a
[52:46] dollar a month or dollar every 10
[52:48] minutes. Okay, doesn't really matter.
[52:50] Just get just get started with something
[52:52] and then just having that little bit
[52:54] you'll take more of an interest in it.
[52:56] You'll start to learn a bit more.
[52:58] Hopefully at some point you'll have
[53:00] you'll probably be buying it on an
[53:02] exchange. At some point you think, well,
[53:03] I now I want to learn about how I take
[53:06] ownership of
[53:07] this, how I take self custody of this.
[53:11] So, it's something I truly own rather
[53:13] than having an exchange look after it
[53:16] for me as if it was just dollars in a
[53:18] bank. Cuz that's that's just a promise
[53:21] that you have Bitcoin. That's not you
[53:22] don't actually have Bitcoin. You only
[53:24] actually have Bitcoin when you take
[53:25] ownership yourself.
[53:28] But getting to that point takes a bit of
[53:29] time and it's a bit of knowledge and
[53:31] because we're in the 90s in the
[53:32] internet, you know, you know, no one has
[53:34] the iPad yet, so there's a bit of
[53:36] friction involved. But it's a very
[53:38] empowering experience to go through it
[53:40] and it helps really cement in your own
[53:43] mind why Bitcoin is so
[53:45] powerful cuz just
[53:48] having just having a fixed cap is not
[53:50] enough.
[53:53] You've got actually got to be able to
[53:54] own it and you got to be able to be free
[53:56] to use it and no one no one can stop you
[54:00] using
[54:00] Bitcoin. No one at
[54:03] all. I think that's great advice for how
[54:06] to start because
[54:07] again the the only wrong amount of
[54:11] Bitcoin to have is is zero, right? You
[54:14] just want to the the very first step is
[54:16] just getting off zero. And like you
[54:18] said, you can buy a dollar. You can
[54:20] dollar cost average. You know, set up
[54:22] just an automatic. There's plenty of
[54:24] different ways to do that. Set up an
[54:26] automatic buy of $1 at whatever interval
[54:28] feels good. And that's a start. And then
[54:31] over time, you'll start to see the value
[54:33] of that grow in measuring in those uh
[54:36] fickle dollar terms, but you'll see it
[54:38] grow. And you'll study more and you'll
[54:40] realize, okay, now I'm starting to
[54:42] understand what I own. Because I think
[54:43] that you're absolutely right that one of
[54:45] the big mistakes people will make is
[54:48] jumping in when there's a lot of hype.
[54:51] They see the number the number going up.
[54:52] They don't want to they don't want to
[54:54] miss out. They think, "Oh, I've got to
[54:55] I've got to put it all in right now or
[54:57] I'm going to miss the boat." Not
[54:59] realizing how early we are, how volatile
[55:01] Bitcoin can be. And then they either
[55:03] sell on the upside, feel like a genius,
[55:05] but then just are back in dollars with
[55:07] the same problem, or it quote crashes
[55:10] down a little bit, they sell, oh, you
[55:13] know, this Bitcoin was a scam, and then
[55:15] they they ignore it for another four
[55:17] years until they look back and see, oh
[55:19] my gosh, if I would have just held it, I
[55:22] wow, I'd be doing a lot better right
[55:23] now. And so that's I think that's
[55:26] excellent advice for people. Start slow,
[55:28] start small, uh, and match your
[55:30] conviction. I think that's that's you're
[55:33] going to be the most comfortable doing
[55:34] it and you're going to be the most it's
[55:35] going to be the most sustainable way for
[55:37] you to actually save. Not just this
[55:40] isn't a speculative investment. This
[55:41] isn't a tech stock. This is you trying
[55:44] to save money. And we're bad at that
[55:47] because the system doesn't encourage us
[55:49] to do it. Bitcoin does, but it requires
[55:52] a bit of a mentality shift. Yeah. And
[55:56] and Bitcoin is volatile, but that that
[55:59] is a good thing. That is a good thing.
[56:01] And you just trust your own gut. Bitcoin
[56:06] should allow you to sleep better at
[56:08] night, not
[56:10] worse. So if you're worrying about it,
[56:12] then you have too
[56:15] much. And so
[56:18] just pay attention to the way that you
[56:21] the way that you feel about it. But
[56:23] but Bitcoin is volatile, but that is
[56:26] good. And this is a really important
[56:28] thing.
[56:30] for people to think about because people
[56:32] have been
[56:33] preconditioned and whole society has
[56:36] been preconditioned to try and remove
[56:37] all risk from
[56:41] everything. But there are good risks and
[56:43] there are bad
[56:44] risks. There is good volatility and bad
[56:48] volatility. The most Bitcoin can can go
[56:51] down is
[56:53] 100%. It sounds pretty
[56:55] bad, but the most it can go up is
[56:58] forever.
[57:01] And this is why it's important to to
[57:05] know why you own it because the dollars
[57:07] are absolutely going to zero. It's just
[57:09] going to take
[57:10] longer. Going to take longer.
[57:13] And if you think about that, the
[57:16] asymmetry when you own
[57:19] Bitcoin, it has to be there.
[57:22] It has to have this skewed volatility to
[57:24] the
[57:25] upside because otherwise
[57:28] how how could something go from being
[57:31] just an
[57:33] email to being worth representing the
[57:37] entire value of the
[57:39] world. You can't go from A to
[57:42] B unless it's volatile. If it wasn't
[57:47] volatile, it wouldn't be worth owning.
[57:52] But it's a it's not how we're sort of
[57:55] it's not how we're wired in modern in
[57:58] modern society.
[58:02] Yeah, it's true. It it requires a bit of
[58:04] a mentality shift. But I think once once
[58:07] you get there, you start to realize
[58:09] that, you know, Bitcoin is not the risky
[58:11] thing. The risky thing is everything
[58:14] except Bitcoin. All these other things
[58:16] are risk. Bitcoin is the one thing you
[58:18] can know uh that you can have some faith
[58:20] in because it's actually predictable in
[58:22] a very unpredictable world. And I think
[58:24] that's what is so so powerful about it.
[58:27] And I love that about it should let you
[58:29] sleep better, not sleep worse. And I
[58:30] think that's that's absolutely true. Now
[58:32] I only lose sleep because I think I wish
[58:34] I had some more Bitcoin, you know?
[58:37] It works. It works both ways. Yeah,
[58:40] definitely. Well, Joe, I want to wrap up
[58:43] here before we do. Okay. And for anyone
[58:45] again who wants to check out your work,
[58:46] I'll I'll link uh all of your links in
[58:48] the show notes. So head down there,
[58:50] watch Joe's video uh what's the problem?
[58:52] It's absolutely outstanding. Follow him
[58:54] on uh on X and on Nostaster uh and check
[58:57] out his got a ton of material available
[58:59] for you too if you get go deep down the
[59:01] rabbit hole and you want to start
[59:02] helping to educate others. Uh but is
[59:04] there anything else you want to leave
[59:06] people with? Is there anything else
[59:08] maybe uh you know you wish somebody had
[59:10] told you earlier on or or any anything
[59:13] else you want to leave folks with before
[59:14] we close out?
[59:18] The important thing is just to get
[59:21] started. Just get off
[59:24] zero because you started the ball
[59:29] rolling like don't underestimate the
[59:32] power of just own just owning something
[59:34] even a small amount of it.
[59:36] even if it's a
[59:39] dollar because now you're
[59:42] invested. Now you have a reason. You
[59:44] have a reason to watch that
[59:46] podcast. Like you're over the the
[59:49] hardest bit of going from zero to
[59:52] one. And so just just get started and
[59:55] then see where it goes.
[59:59] I think that's that's
[60:01] uh extremely sound advice. So yeah, if
[60:04] you're listening to this, get started.
[60:07] Uh uh if you've made it through this
[60:09] video, Joe's video is a great place to
[60:13] go next to go deeper down the rabbit
[60:15] hole and understand it in a in a
[60:17] different way. Uh Joe, anywhere else you
[60:20] want to send folks? It's assats versus
[60:22] fiat.com. Uh versus fiat.com and we
[60:26] have so many languages available now.
[60:31] Um, what's the problem is you can find
[60:34] it at saxverfeiat.com. You can also just
[60:36] Google it now. It's on the first page of
[60:38] Google. So, which is uh crazy for
[60:41] generic words, but there's
[60:44] there's massive amount of resources in
[60:47] lots of different languages. If you want
[60:49] to after seeing the video, get the
[60:51] slides and share them with others or
[60:52] share share a video or a translation
[60:55] with friends and family around the
[60:57] world, chances are we've got your
[60:58] language. And so just, you know, check
[61:01] the YouTube subtitles or see the the
[61:04] extra videos in native languages on on
[61:06] on YouTube as well. Um, yeah, and get in
[61:09] touch if you have any any questions.
[61:12] Fantastic. Well, Joe, thank you so much.
[61:15] Uh, this was excellent. I hope this
[61:17] encouraged people to to get off zero and
[61:19] to to just take that first step. But
[61:21] thanks so much for sharing your time.
