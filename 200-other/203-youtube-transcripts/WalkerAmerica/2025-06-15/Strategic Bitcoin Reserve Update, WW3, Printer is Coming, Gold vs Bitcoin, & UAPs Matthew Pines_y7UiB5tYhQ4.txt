[00:00] Seems like every time missiles start
[00:01] flying, people go, "Is this World War
[00:03] II?" And I think my read situation is
[00:06] we've kind of been in World War II since
[00:09] you could say co, you know, if you're
[00:11] being a bit more conspiratorial or at
[00:12] least since the Russia Ukraine war
[00:14] popped up. So that's that's why I think
[00:16] Bitcoin is going to be like very very
[00:17] important in my mind. It's cuz it's not
[00:20] only is it like an ethos and a political
[00:21] movement, but it's it's uh it's a vortex
[00:24] for actual financial capital, which is
[00:26] to first order political capital, right?
[00:29] And so you have this this this this
[00:31] mimemetic engine that is like attracting
[00:34] people capital and is now kind of now
[00:36] swirling in and bringing in you know so
[00:38] wealth funds and black rocks and
[00:40] presidents and you know like staffers
[00:43] for central banks like we're having fed
[00:45] you know fed staffers come to our button
[00:46] policy summit like this is this like
[00:49] like black hole that's that's like
[00:51] that's that's accreing here. When you're
[00:52] in these phase transitions
[00:54] you know a lot of the things you think
[00:56] are going to survive don't. And it's
[00:59] kind of uh not obvious like what makes
[01:01] it through and what adapts. It's funny.
[01:03] It's like people ask me, okay, you're
[01:05] involved in both kind of the Bitcoin
[01:06] stuff and now, you know, increasingly so
[01:07] on the UAP side. And like Bitcoin is a
[01:09] very serious thing and I think Bitcoin
[01:11] monetizing to parody with gold is a
[01:13] serious thing. It's obviously the
[01:15] subject of my professional work. But if
[01:17] I zoom out right over the next 5 10
[01:18] years, like what's the most important
[01:21] thing? It's actually not the big one
[01:23] stuff. It's this UAP stuff. Like this is
[01:25] the thing that's going to change the
[01:26] lives of my children much more so than
[01:28] Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin will give them a
[01:30] good life, but this thing will change
[01:32] the future of human civilization.

[02:38] Matthew Pines, welcome back uh to the
[02:41] show. It's been eight months since you
[02:43] came on here, but I did get to uh did
[02:45] get to bump into you in Vegas, which was
[02:47] nice. Are you fully recovered from uh
[02:49] from that? Uh about although I went
[02:52] straight from that to another trip. Uh
[02:57] and then uh from that I went to Disney
[02:59] with the family. Oh, nice. I just got
[03:02] back two days ago. And Disney is not
[03:03] exactly relaxing. Uh that's that's not I
[03:06] haven't I've never I've never been there
[03:07] with kids, but I can imagine uh that is
[03:10] uh that is difficult. Yeah, you're
[03:13] walking about 10 miles a day uh in the
[03:15] in in the heat and the kids had fun. But
[03:17] uh you know then coming back and then
[03:19] hitting the ground running. We got two
[03:20] weeks now till the Bitcoin policy
[03:22] summit. So you know I'll sleep uh next
[03:25] month. We'll see. Well, yeah. Uh and
[03:28] want to give a shout out to that because
[03:29] I'm very excited to come to the policy
[03:31] summit. That is uh I'm I'm going to go
[03:34] ahead and give it a hard plug here. June
[03:37] 25th, 26th, Washington DC
[03:39] bdcpolicsummit.org.
[03:41] Disclaimer, you guys are not paying me
[03:43] in any way to say this. Um I'm just
[03:45] trying to direct people to it because I
[03:46] love what you guys are doing. And you
[03:48] can use promo code Walker for 21% off
[03:50] your tickets and I do not get a kickback
[03:52] from that. You just get to come for 21%
[03:54] off. So, isn't that nice? Plug aside,
[03:58] I'm really excited for that. Uh, I think
[04:00] it'll be very different from I've
[04:02] obviously watched the live streams of
[04:03] your prior summits, but I feel being
[04:06] there is going to be a very different
[04:07] sort of vibe from what uh what I'm used
[04:10] to at Bitcoin conferences. I mean,
[04:12] certainly there were a lot of suits in
[04:14] Vegas this year. I assume there will be
[04:16] uh all suits in DC. Fair assessment.
[04:19] Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely uh
[04:21] definitely a suit uh a suit occasion.
[04:23] You know, maybe you can get away without
[04:24] a tie, but you know, we're trying to
[04:26] we're trying to dress it up. that's kind
[04:27] of been the the bit since the beginning
[04:29] is uh you know speak the language of DC
[04:32] and the form and format of DC. And so
[04:34] the first summit was basically in the
[04:37] aftermath of FTX and it was like BPI
[04:40] saying to the uh administrative state
[04:42] like crypto is different than Bitcoin
[04:44] and Bitcoin is not that and Bitcoin is
[04:47] here to stay and we'll be around and so
[04:49] you should take it seriously and not you
[04:51] know um write it off entirely. And then
[04:53] the next year we did it was kind of like
[04:55] a see we were right it is still here but
[04:58] it was more a matter of okay well how to
[05:00] think about it and how to frame it in
[05:02] the context of these other kind of
[05:03] policy areas human rights um national
[05:06] security uh the environment energy
[05:09] systems uh etc. And now we're in the
[05:12] third the third year and it's it seems
[05:14] like each year has been like a step
[05:16] function jump in terms of the level of
[05:18] seriousness and the level of engagement
[05:20] that we're getting. Um and obviously the
[05:23] larger political and geopolitical
[05:24] salience of Bitcoin as a thing uh has
[05:27] scaled up you know um orders of
[05:28] magnitude and so we're expecting you
[05:31] know again to like double the size of
[05:33] the participants. Um we're having like
[05:35] an absolutely packed agenda. It's
[05:37] designed essentially as like a you know
[05:40] to generate as much high signal um
[05:44] discussions and presentations as
[05:46] possible per unit time. So like everyone
[05:48] is basically given like five t minutes
[05:50] right for like lightning talks and
[05:52] presentations and it's like every muscle
[05:54] must be tight and so we have a few
[05:56] panels but the panels are there
[05:57] essentially to maximize participation on
[05:59] the stage and again it's very much like
[06:02] focused deliberative not like
[06:04] jibberjabber sort of filler content
[06:06] right because you have to kind of fill
[06:07] up a bunch of of of of air time. It's
[06:09] like here are some hard um discussion
[06:12] points that we want to uh get into the
[06:15] minds of essentially the DC the DC
[06:19] machine um which is now being told from
[06:22] the top down right from the president
[06:23] that Bitcoin is a strategic asset a
[06:26] digital gold uh that they intend to hold
[06:28] for the long term and maybe even acquire
[06:31] more of uh you know per per the analysis
[06:34] being done by the treasury secretary and
[06:36] the commerce secretary on budget neutral
[06:38] ways of acquiring additional Bitcoin But
[06:39] now that sort of signal is being
[06:40] filtered through the bureaucracies and
[06:42] so everyone from the energy department
[06:44] to the department of defense uh to the
[06:47] intelligence community to the department
[06:48] of treasury to the department of state
[06:51] like has to think about well what does
[06:53] this mean for my particular area right
[06:55] and they have very specific sort of
[06:57] technocratic mandates. So we're going to
[06:58] have folks from the executive branch,
[07:00] folks, you know, staffers for Congress,
[07:03] other sort of, you know, non- Bitcoin
[07:04] related think tanks, experts in economic
[07:06] statecraft or AI, technology policy,
[07:10] energy systems, uh, you know, all of
[07:12] which Bitcoin is kind of touching in
[07:14] increasingly significant ways. Um, and
[07:16] so I'd say like Bitcoiners might
[07:18] actually even be like a minority at the
[07:19] Bitcoin policy summit, right? We're
[07:21] definitely going to bring a contingent
[07:22] of Bitcoiners and we're going to have
[07:23] them on stage and, you know, kind of,
[07:25] you know, preach the good word in in a
[07:27] very serious fashion. But the main
[07:28] objective of the policy summit is to
[07:31] move the Overton window inside the
[07:33] policy conversation inside DC across the
[07:35] administrative state. And Bitcoin is
[07:37] now, I think, fully legitimized as a
[07:40] subject, right? That's kind of been the
[07:42] work of the last several years is to
[07:43] just legitimize it as a thing for these
[07:46] people to address seriously within their
[07:48] responsibilities or within their
[07:49] professional domain. And now that that's
[07:52] happened, it's okay. Well, then now
[07:54] what? Right? Like it's legitimate, but
[07:56] then what does it actually mean? What
[07:57] does what does good Bitcoin policy
[07:58] actually look like? Um uh beyond just
[08:02] number go up, right? How does it
[08:03] actually affect our energy systems, our
[08:04] human rights, um uh you know, our
[08:06] commitments to liberal values, our
[08:08] commitments to um technology,
[08:10] innovation, to freedom to transact, uh
[08:13] to, you know, the national security
[08:14] interests of the United States. Like
[08:15] these are all complicated issues. And so
[08:18] we're going to have, you know, senior
[08:19] policy makers, you elected
[08:22] representatives, government officials,
[08:24] folks from civil society, human rights
[08:25] activists, you know, executives,
[08:28] technologists, our policy experts,
[08:30] everyone on stage just kind of like bang
[08:32] bang bang. Uh, and then we're going to
[08:33] have, you know, we're going to have a
[08:34] fun party the night before. We're just
[08:36] going to have a day on the hill the day
[08:37] after on the 26th to bring Bitcoiners to
[08:40] to the to their elected representatives
[08:42] offices. Um, yeah. So, I think it's just
[08:44] going to be a really really significant
[08:46] event. Obviously, we're putting a lot of
[08:47] work into it. We think it's going to be
[08:48] really impactful. And yeah, I think if
[08:51] uh time is still uh uh available to to
[08:55] snag a ticket, uh grab that discount
[08:56] code while while it's still available.
[08:58] We're we're kind of clo we're coming up
[09:00] on kind of what our target kind of cap
[09:02] is for the event. We want to keep it um
[09:05] manageable. Uh we have a much larger
[09:07] event this year than we've had in years
[09:08] past. Um but even then, it's it's going
[09:10] to get pretty filled up. So, you know,
[09:12] snag it while you can.
[09:14] Uh, you know, just speaking of kind of
[09:16] shifting that uh that Overton window,
[09:18] you guys certainly kind of seem to have
[09:20] blown it wide open and obviously it not
[09:22] just you guys, but the work that you
[09:24] guys have done has clearly been
[09:26] extremely significant and this is
[09:28] evidenced by facts like the vice
[09:30] president of sitting vice president of
[09:31] the United States calling out BDC policy
[09:34] institute on stage at the Bitcoin
[09:36] conference unprompted. Uh, and I I think
[09:38] you were you were on the news desk at at
[09:41] that time as that was happening, right?
[09:42] I mean like like that's pretty
[09:44] incredible to see. And yes, there have
[09:46] been politicians who have been
[09:47] campaigning uh campaigning at the
[09:50] Bitcoin conference before and there have
[09:51] been sitting senators and things, but
[09:52] this was a sitting vice president. This
[09:54] is a huge deal and to see that shift. I
[09:57] mean, that's that's that's pretty
[09:58] remarkable to see like this. It's not
[10:00] just okay, we can talk about Bitcoin.
[10:01] It's like we can talk about Bitcoin
[10:03] policy. We can talk about how this is
[10:05] actually strategically significant and
[10:06] important for the United States of
[10:08] America, why it's a strategic priority.
[10:10] I mean, this is kind of like that's got
[10:12] to feel pretty good to see your work uh
[10:14] really get called out on such a truly
[10:17] like national stage.
[10:19] Yes. You know, I had the privilege of
[10:21] speaking with the vice president the day
[10:22] before in a private meeting. Um and you
[10:25] know, I think the he gave a speech the
[10:28] next day and it was kind of two speeches
[10:30] in one. If you if you were tracking it
[10:32] was kind of the prepared remarks he was
[10:33] reading off the teleprompter that was
[10:35] kind of meh. It was kind of like warmed
[10:38] over, you know, kind of banal stuff
[10:41] about blockchain for health care and it
[10:43] was clearly like written by some
[10:44] staffers, some like, you know, a bunch
[10:46] of people that didn't really know like
[10:48] who they were going to talk to and it I
[10:50] don't think it was going over so well.
[10:51] And he's a smart guy and I think he
[10:52] realized the room wasn't like responding
[10:55] well to his remarks. Um, and then he
[10:58] decided at the end of his, you know,
[10:59] prepared remarks to kind of riff for
[11:01] like another five maybe 10 minutes. And
[11:03] that was a very different sort of
[11:06] speech, right? And it was his sort of
[11:07] extemporaneous
[11:09] uh kind of u elucidation of how he's
[11:12] thinking about Bitcoin uh in this in
[11:15] this larger strategic context. And that
[11:18] was kind of reflective of the
[11:19] conversation we were having. um think
[11:21] about Bitcoin not just as this sort of
[11:24] niche asset from a particular political
[11:26] interest group that cares about it uh or
[11:29] that's part of this sort of uh industry
[11:31] that's lobbying for more favorable you
[11:33] know regulation but as an as a network
[11:35] and an asset that is rapidly you know
[11:37] transforming um uh how we think about
[11:40] the next several years of technology
[11:42] competition the monetary system and US
[11:44] geopolitical interests and that shifting
[11:46] the frame from like a kind of a narrow
[11:50] kind of inside the beltway, you know,
[11:52] industry. I'm going to give a speech to
[11:54] an industry lobby, right? And I'm going
[11:56] to say things at the like to a hey, this
[11:59] is now going to be a significant thing
[12:00] even more so than it already is. And
[12:02] it's it's on this curve like AI is on
[12:04] this curve uh that are going to be, you
[12:07] know, one of the more significant
[12:08] drivers of of of opportunity and risk um
[12:12] for the US government in the next few
[12:14] years. And it's all taking place in the
[12:15] context of, you know, a lot of
[12:16] geopolitical um you know, instability
[12:18] and competition with China. And so he
[12:19] was kind of just thinking out loud and
[12:21] he sort of said, you know, this is a
[12:24] complicated ball basically, right? A
[12:25] complicated knot that has AI and China
[12:27] and Bitcoin and stable coins and gold
[12:30] and the monetary system and geopolitics.
[12:32] It's like all and and and and and our
[12:34] internal political kind of uh you know
[12:37] surveillance that we have across these
[12:39] different issues like AI is you know in
[12:40] his view maybe were sort of liberal
[12:42] coded and Bitcoin and crypto is more
[12:44] more sort of right-wing coded. Um, so
[12:47] these are all like highly complicated
[12:49] kind of issues all bound together. And
[12:50] he and he sort of had a call for the
[12:52] community to kind of have a two-way
[12:53] conversation to help them essentially
[12:55] untie that out to help help frame
[12:58] Bitcoin uh as aligned positively with US
[13:01] strategic interests and values. And
[13:03] that's basically been BPI's work uh for
[13:05] the last few years. has been like one of
[13:07] our main kind of uh you know hobby
[13:09] horses is to try to keep keep kind of
[13:11] pounding that message and to have the
[13:12] vice president kind of recognize that
[13:13] while I was sitting there like you know
[13:15] then commenting on it in real time was a
[13:17] bit a bit of an out-of- body experience
[13:19] um but uh yeah I just maybe it's it's
[13:21] you know in retrospect it was inevitable
[13:23] right like but it is encouraging to see
[13:26] that come from a senior policy maker's
[13:28] mouth and not be prepared remarks right
[13:31] but actually be something that he's
[13:32] internalized and is verbalizing and is
[13:34] sort of clearly trying to digest test
[13:36] it, you know, in real time almost.
[13:40] Yeah. I mean, it's it's refreshing, I
[13:42] guess, when a politician doesn't just
[13:43] read off the teleprompter. And you can
[13:46] very quickly tell when somebody, you
[13:47] know, I I'm guessing that whoever wrote
[13:50] that speech, whichever staffer wrote
[13:51] that initial speech, probably got a
[13:53] little bit of a talking to afterwards
[13:54] about knowing their audience a bit
[13:56] better. But, you know, it's nice to see
[13:58] somebody riff on that. It's nice to see
[13:59] you guys get called out for the work
[14:01] that you are doing. And again, I think
[14:02] that this we're at this point now where
[14:05] Bitcoin is not like it's, you know, it's
[14:07] it's become a almost mainstream topic
[14:10] now. Like this is something that's not
[14:12] taboo. It's okay to talk about. It's
[14:14] encouraged to talk about it. And people
[14:16] realize that Bitcoin and the Bitcoin,
[14:18] let's say, community, the Bitcoin
[14:20] industry can politically move the
[14:22] needle. Like this is not an
[14:24] insignificant group of individuals. This
[14:26] is quite a uh both economically and
[14:29] mimetically powerful group. uh certain
[14:32] arguably more mimemetically powerful
[14:34] than economically powerful at this
[14:35] point, but that you know, I don't want
[14:36] to split hairs on that. So, I'm I'm kind
[14:38] of curious, you know, I uh and we've got
[14:40] a there's a lot I want to get into with
[14:42] you, uh Matt, but I do want to get your
[14:44] thoughts just on the strategic reserve
[14:46] because I know that's that was a big uh
[14:48] policy push for you guys. Uh the the
[14:51] last summit that you did, if I'm uh if
[14:54] I'm remembering correctly, like timing
[14:55] coincided kind of well with that. you
[14:57] guys were pushing a lot a lot of the
[14:59] language that you had supplied uh in
[15:01] your writings was used to kind of craft
[15:04] that uh that those executive orders were
[15:07] now a few months out from that. Uh I
[15:09] know there were 30-day time limits and
[15:11] that sort of thing for to collect this
[15:12] information from agencies. Is there
[15:13] anything you can share or anything that
[15:15] you're kind of aware of uh as far as the
[15:17] progress that's been made on that? Are
[15:18] there any changes to that? It seems that
[15:20] Trump's reaffirmed that commitment to uh
[15:22] to those executive orders. What's your
[15:25] read on this right now? How do you see
[15:26] the current state of it? How do you see
[15:27] it progressing? If you're stuck spending
[15:30] dollars, at least stop earning dirty
[15:32] fiat rewards. Use Fold to earn Bitcoin
[15:36] on everyday purchases and regular
[15:38] expenses, groceries, bills, travel, home
[15:41] improvement. I literally just earned
[15:43] 2,23
[15:45] sats buying a $100 Amazon gift card on
[15:48] Fold. You don't even need to use the
[15:50] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[15:53] You can connect your favorite credit
[15:54] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[15:57] on merchant offers or go allin. Make

[16:21] sign up.
[16:23] Yeah. So the executive order was signed
[16:24] in early March and then we did our
[16:25] Bitcoin for America summit essentially
[16:27] like the week or two after that. Um and
[16:30] uh was for two timing because we
[16:32] designed that summit to try to like draw
[16:34] particular attention to Bitcoin in
[16:36] particular and the strategic importance
[16:38] of it. And you know then the the
[16:40] executive order kind of all kind of
[16:42] amplified that message in the context of
[16:44] most of the crypto policy priorities in
[16:46] DC being focused stable coins and then
[16:49] market structure and this sort of
[16:50] strategic Bitcoin reserve as an idea was
[16:53] sort of kind of not even on the on the
[16:54] radar screen and kind of kind of got me
[16:56] into existence and then we were trying
[16:58] to like flesh that out as like an actual
[17:00] policy proposal to draft executive
[17:02] orders and then you know we saw some of
[17:04] the some of that reflected in some of
[17:06] the you know um the the documents that
[17:08] came out and and the statements that
[17:10] have since come out of, you know, folks
[17:12] like uh like Bo Hines. The timing we're
[17:14] at right now is executive order, you
[17:16] know, had a number of different
[17:17] provisions. I think the mo most
[17:19] important one that's kind of the next
[17:20] milestone to look for is going to be a
[17:21] kind of consolidated uh report that uh I
[17:25] think Treasury Department is mostly
[17:27] writing, but Bo and the team is kind of
[17:29] the whole working group, president's
[17:30] working group, individual assets is is
[17:31] contributing to. Uh it's due July 22nd
[17:35] and my understanding is that's going to
[17:36] basically touch on everything. It's like
[17:37] the the the White House's uh sort of
[17:40] statement of how they view digital
[17:42] assets across the board and that will
[17:44] include provisions and discussion of the
[17:45] strategic Bitcoin reserve. And so what
[17:48] I'm looking for in that report is uh how
[17:51] they um get back to the request that was
[17:54] made of the commerce and the treasury
[17:55] departments for budgetneutral means of
[17:57] acquiring additional Bitcoin uh without
[18:00] essentially adding to the taxpayers's
[18:02] burden. And so I'm aware of the fact
[18:04] that you know several you know within a
[18:06] within a several within a several weeks
[18:08] of that executive order like the tasking
[18:10] started going down through the
[18:11] bureaucracies of like come up with that
[18:13] come up with like these different ideas
[18:15] right and they have had a number of
[18:17] meetings to I think review the candidate
[18:19] options right to acquire additional
[18:21] Bitcoin um that sort of run the gamut
[18:23] from pretty trivial couch cushion types
[18:26] of things to like pretty strategic like
[18:28] very important you know scale type types
[18:30] of things and everywhere in
[18:32] And there's like questions of
[18:33] interpretation about the precise uh you
[18:36] know legal authority to use certain
[18:38] funds uh for purchasing Bitcoin as well
[18:42] as you know the the overall sort of
[18:44] execution of setting up uh Bitcoin
[18:47] reserve right like within the Treasury
[18:48] Department like where does it sit who's
[18:50] whose office like manages this like
[18:52] whose staffs this what memos have to be
[18:55] signed like which custodians do they use
[18:57] right there's lots of like operational
[18:58] implementation questions that I think
[19:01] were starting to be worked at. And then
[19:03] of course you had liberation day, the
[19:04] whole tariff and that kind of consumed
[19:06] all of the senior policy makers
[19:08] attention like commerce department,
[19:09] treasury department, you know, and in
[19:11] the rack of priorities. It's like global
[19:13] trade war, you know, $5 in the bond
[19:17] market like that kind of takes takes
[19:18] priority. I think the Bitcoin stuff kind
[19:20] of went to the back burner. I think it
[19:22] started to creep back up, especially in
[19:23] the weeks before the summit. They wanted
[19:25] to kind of have some uh so the weeks
[19:26] before the conference in Vegas. So, I
[19:28] think they're gearing up for this
[19:30] release of this report in, you know, a
[19:32] month or so. That'll be a good indicator
[19:35] of how seriously they're taking, you
[19:37] know, these proposals. Um, how much
[19:39] they're willing to talk about publicly,
[19:41] right? Because I think there's also a a
[19:43] question on the sort of um the audit
[19:46] essentially of the government's Bitcoin
[19:47] holdings and whether they would um make
[19:49] the results of that audit public um
[19:51] which they haven't done. Um now making
[19:54] you know doing such an audit is not as
[19:56] trivial as it might seem. Like there's
[19:57] lots of different government agencies
[19:59] that have some you know ability to hold
[20:01] crypto from either uh you know sort of
[20:04] lawful seizures or for operational
[20:06] purposes for you know undercover u
[20:08] stings or intelligence activities etc
[20:10] etc. And so, you know, coming up with
[20:13] like the the actual final like
[20:15] tabulation, uh, probably took a while
[20:17] uh, and probably had to like, you know,
[20:19] go around and actually shake the tree.
[20:22] Um, so now that they have at least a
[20:24] good sense of what the number is, now
[20:25] the question is, well, do you talk about
[20:27] it, right? Like, do you do you say that
[20:29] that number is the number? Cuz, you
[20:31] know, it's like strategic. I don't know
[20:33] what the number really is, but if it's
[20:34] more than what people think, well, maybe
[20:37] that kind of deflates the urgency to to
[20:39] get more, right? Uh, and people might
[20:41] ask questions. Well, how does the
[20:42] government actually have that much more
[20:43] Bitcoin? If it's much less than what
[20:45] people thought, well, there's other
[20:47] uncomfortable questions. What happened
[20:48] to the Bitcoin we thought we had, right?
[20:50] Um, and then if it's somewhere around
[20:51] what we think it is, okay, but then you
[20:54] might want to like, you know, settle on
[20:56] with the like the fact that they haven't
[20:58] talked about it is itself, I think, an
[21:00] interesting question, right? It reveals
[21:02] that they're kind of trying to keep
[21:03] their cars close to their chest to
[21:05] preserve their optionality. I think as a
[21:07] citizen though, it's my Bitcoin. Like I
[21:09] want to know how much we got, right? So
[21:11] I like I want them to publish the number
[21:13] as soon as possible. Um but you know,
[21:15] this is this is the White House. So it's
[21:17] it's their prerogative. Um but but they
[21:19] might they might put that in the report
[21:20] on July 22nd as part of this
[21:22] consolidated review. So you know, it
[21:23] might just be a matter of you the
[21:25] process playing out. So that's that's
[21:26] kind of the inside baseball where things
[21:27] stand there. Again, it's kind of like
[21:29] the executive order was kind of the
[21:31] captain calling out like a new heading
[21:34] for like the ship of the state. uh and
[21:36] it's a big cruise ship or a big aircraft
[21:38] carrier and the captain is called out
[21:40] like you know new heading and then
[21:42] everyone is on the bridge looking around
[21:43] and being like we're still moving the
[21:45] same direction like are we turning like
[21:47] well it's a huge ship and like just you
[21:49] know it takes time for that instruction
[21:51] to be turn to be turned into an actual
[21:53] turn of the wheel and then the wheel has
[21:54] to turn this massive thing and it might
[21:56] only look like an imperceptible little
[21:58] you know shift in course uh for for the
[22:01] beginning but I think it's clear to me
[22:04] that we're now you know the ship of the
[22:06] state is sh is about to make this turn,
[22:08] right? Now, it's not irreversible,
[22:10] right? Just like if you're on a massive
[22:12] aircraft carrier and it's like blade
[22:13] that order, right? Well, you could
[22:15] easily undo it and the ship wouldn't
[22:16] have turned that much. So, we're kind of
[22:18] in this fragile period where you kind of
[22:19] have to like keep keep that momentum
[22:21] going and keep the consistency in terms
[22:23] of redirecting the course of the of of
[22:25] of the entire ship of state, right?
[22:27] There's just the political class, the
[22:28] president, these political appointees,
[22:30] and then there's this entire
[22:32] administrative bureaucracy, right? that
[22:34] uh that could try to slow, could stall,
[22:37] could undermine or could amplify and
[22:39] accelerate the president's instruction,
[22:41] you know, with their various tools. And
[22:42] so that what what BPI is trying to do
[22:43] with especially the summit coming up is
[22:45] try to work at that level, right? Invite
[22:47] all of those people, right? The deputy
[22:49] directors of the CIA, right? The the uh
[22:52] gentleman who manages the office of
[22:53] strategic capital at the Department of
[22:55] Defense, uh senior officials in the
[22:56] department of energy, senior officials
[22:58] um in the department of treasury, uh
[23:01] folks from the department of state. So,
[23:02] these are going to come and they're
[23:03] going to hear like, you know, this is a
[23:05] real serious thing. This isn't just like
[23:07] a memo that was signed back in March
[23:09] that you can kind of like ignore or
[23:11] like, you know, pretend maybe you didn't
[23:13] read. It's like, no, there's like
[23:15] hundreds of people here, all your peers,
[23:18] including some senior government
[23:19] officials saying uh and doubling down on
[23:21] this direction of travel. And then it's
[23:23] like, okay, well, what does this
[23:24] actually look like? And and do you need
[23:25] help? Right? Do you need ideas? Right?
[23:27] Do you need like, you know, some
[23:29] assistance here? Um, so yeah. Yeah. So,
[23:31] yeah, I'll for example, I'll be doing a
[23:32] fireside chat with the deputy director
[23:34] of the CIA. Uh Ken Egan, who's our
[23:36] director of government affairs, is doing
[23:37] a fireside chat with Patrick Wit, who is
[23:40] both the director of the office of
[23:42] strategic capital at the Department of
[23:43] Defense, and he is Bo Hines's deputy on
[23:47] the president's working group on digital
[23:49] assets. Um, and he joined Bo Hines on an
[23:52] official uh visit delegation to El
[23:55] Salvador meeting with President Bule
[23:57] about Bitcoin. Um, I just find that like
[24:00] an interesting thing, right? Like this
[24:02] and Patrick Whit is a very, you know,
[24:05] he's not a political guy, right? He's a
[24:06] kind of a technologist, a security guy,
[24:09] um you know, kind of a career person and
[24:12] he's decided that, you know, or somebody
[24:14] has decided to put him put him in this
[24:16] interesting position straddling, you
[24:18] know, core economic statecraft, national
[24:21] security work inside of defense and
[24:24] white house level, you know, more
[24:25] political kind of policym around digital
[24:28] assets and and those are, you know,
[24:31] those are things that I like
[24:32] hypothetically have said are very
[24:33] integrated and connected things and now
[24:36] that is, you know, sort of instantiated
[24:38] with a senior um official. So, these are
[24:42] just clues, I think, right? They're not
[24:43] dispositive, right? They're they could
[24:45] they could be undone, but they're
[24:47] indicators of of maybe below the
[24:49] waterline how serious Bitcoin is being
[24:51] treated by parts of the government. Um,
[24:53] not saying everyone is on board, but um,
[24:56] you know, the deputy director of the CIA
[24:57] doesn't give public remarks all that
[25:00] often, um, let alone at like kind of a
[25:03] relatively new think tank for Bitcoin.
[25:05] Uh, you know, it's not like a normal
[25:07] thing that you would expect, right? If
[25:09] you just asked me a few months ago
[25:10] whether we would get the deputy director
[25:12] of the CIA to just do a pretty pretty,
[25:14] you know, open-ended fireside. It's not
[25:16] like a fiveminute prepared remarks
[25:17] talking points like jibberjabber. It's
[25:19] like, hey, you know, we want to talk
[25:21] about Bitcoin and China and street
[25:23] competition and why it's important and
[25:25] why Bitcoin reserve is important and the
[25:27] future of money and you know, all this
[25:29] stuff. I'm curious to hear what he has
[25:32] to say.
[25:33] Have you had conversations with him
[25:35] before? Do you know what his position is
[25:37] at all? Or are you going in somewhat uh
[25:39] in the dark as far as that goes? No. No,
[25:42] I have not spoken to him yet. Um the
[25:43] only public remarks he's made on the
[25:45] subject was actually a short interview
[25:46] he gave with um with Pompiano. Uh which
[25:50] it was actually I saw that interview and
[25:51] I was like, "Hm, this is interesting."
[25:53] Uh and uh I retweeted it and uh the
[25:57] director of public affairs for the CIA
[25:59] immediately like retweeted me and
[26:00] followed me. And then I was like, "Oh."
[26:03] So I talked to Ken, our our our
[26:05] government affairs guy, and I was like,
[26:06] "What do you think?" And we're like, "We
[26:08] should ask." And we sent the we sent the
[26:10] email and they were like, "Okay, well
[26:12] ask for details, timing, you know,
[26:15] what's the scope, like who's going to be
[26:16] there, like what else, what other
[26:18] speakers, and kind of like, is this
[26:20] legit?" And pretty pretty, you know,
[26:22] pretty quickly we were like, "Yeah,
[26:23] they're good to go." And just basic
[26:25] logistics questions and security and
[26:27] whatnot. But, you know, we haven't had
[26:29] any like, you know, don't don't ask this
[26:32] or, you know, this is the canned answer.
[26:34] But, um, no, uh, I'm curious to hear
[26:37] what he has to say live. It'll be I'll
[26:38] I'll be learning, you know, with the
[26:40] audience. We'll see. Just a a day in the
[26:42] life of Matt Pines. Normal stuff. It's
[26:45] Yeah, I love it. Does the This is off
[26:48] slightly off topic. You think the CIA
[26:50] just has a huge slush fund of Bitcoin
[26:52] that they use for operational purposes?
[26:55] Well, again, it's like I think they
[26:57] definitely have used it. Um, like that's
[26:59] I know that for a fact, right? Like it's
[27:01] probably not controversial. Like they
[27:03] were um engaging in all sort like you
[27:05] would use all sorts of tools, right?
[27:07] When you're trying to pay pay assets,
[27:09] you know, with Yeah. Essentially, if I'm
[27:11] a spy in another country and I have
[27:14] valuable intel and I tell the CIA, I
[27:16] will only give you that intel if you pay
[27:17] me Bitcoin, right? Well, the CIA is
[27:20] going to get some Bitcoin and give it to
[27:21] you, right? So, so like if you know that
[27:23] this is a thing people might ask where
[27:24] you're going to have some in reserve,
[27:25] right? Just so that you can just use it
[27:27] as an operational contingency fund. Um,
[27:29] so that seems like a pretty common sense
[27:31] thing for them to do. Um, like how much,
[27:34] right? I think this is an interesting
[27:35] question. Like they might have acquired
[27:36] like a significant amount of Bitcoin
[27:39] pretty early on and it might have been
[27:41] worth, you know, a few million, tens of
[27:42] millions of dollars for like operational
[27:44] purposes, but that might be worth now
[27:46] like billions of dollars, right? Um, so
[27:48] this is interesting, you know, question,
[27:50] right? with this inventory of bit of of
[27:52] Bitcoin. The government is like there
[27:53] might be like just like somewhat random
[27:55] low-level operational uh you know
[27:58] accounts somewhere in the agency for off
[28:00] the books stuff that they they've had,
[28:03] you know, and maybe it was like maybe
[28:05] the accounting was like this is worth a
[28:07] few million dollars and then somebody
[28:09] wakes up one day and goes, "Wait a
[28:10] second, what happened to that? How much
[28:12] Bitcoin do we actually have in there?"
[28:13] And it's like, "Oh, that's like a
[28:14] ton of money." It's like uh oh, what do
[28:16] we do with that? Um so I think there's I
[28:19] think there's that. There's also um I
[28:22] think uh a possibility that is more
[28:26] crypto generally that has been seized by
[28:28] elements of the government but not
[28:30] necessarily through like the official
[28:32] like you know sort of seizure processes
[28:36] held at the Marshall service right like
[28:38] if you're going after a cartel in South
[28:40] America and you happen to just like you
[28:42] know come across a bunch of crypto right
[28:46] I don't know like are you going to pull
[28:48] that all the way back and sent in file.
[28:50] I don't know like historically the
[28:51] government uh you know has has seen
[28:54] better uses of of of of those sorts of
[28:57] funds that they've acquired not just
[28:58] crypto but you know others other sorts
[29:00] of things. So I suspect there's probably
[29:03] a good amount I don't know like it's
[29:05] probably not going to like move the full
[29:07] like it's probably not in the tens of
[29:09] thousands of Bitcoin but is it thousands
[29:11] of Bitcoin? Maybe tens of thousands. I
[29:13] don't know. Like I wouldn't be surprised
[29:14] um if it's if it's in that range. I'm
[29:17] I'm excited for your conversation
[29:19] because I think that'll be uh it'll be
[29:20] quite interesting. Should I do I need to
[29:22] bring a burner phone uh to this to this
[29:24] event? I don't I don't know how this
[29:26] works. I'm not familiar uh with uh with
[29:28] with protocol for interacting with high
[29:30] level CIA officials. No, I mean I they
[29:35] already know they're already in my phone
[29:36] anyway. They're in my phone anyway.
[29:38] Walker, you know, you're uh you're uh I
[29:41] don't maybe maybe this is this is a deep
[29:43] cover op that you're running here. Oh
[29:45] boy. Here we go. This is I, you know,
[29:47] just a just a law-abiding Bitcoin
[29:49] podcaster over here. Nothing to see. You
[29:51] even have a birth certificate, Walker. I
[29:52] like, you know, what's your what's your
[29:55] real name here? You know, my real name
[29:58] is Walker America, of course. Um, this
[30:00] is says it right on my birth
[30:02] certificate. It's uh it's Hawaiian,
[30:04] actually. Um, okay. So, excited for
[30:07] that. Uh, and again, I encourage people
[30:09] if you are in the area or feel like
[30:11] traveling, like check this out. I'm
[30:13] excited for it as a different sort of
[30:14] Bitcoin conference. And again, I think
[30:16] the work that you guys are doing is
[30:18] really important just because you you'd
[30:21] rather have government officials that
[30:24] are at least educated about this stuff
[30:25] and realize its strategic importance and
[30:28] aren't just Elizabeth Warren about it,
[30:30] right? Like I would prefer, you know,
[30:32] you can ignore the state all you want,
[30:35] but like the state's not going to ignore
[30:36] you, especially as you, you know, if
[30:38] you're dealing with a an asset that is
[30:40] growing in market cap exponentially.
[30:42] It's like we I'd rather have them uh not
[30:45] hate Bitcoin. So, I appreciate all the
[30:47] work that you guys are doing for that. I
[30:49] want to I want to switch gears slightly
[30:51] because we are it is Friday uh the 13th
[30:54] right now as we record this. I'll get
[30:56] this episode out to everyone later
[30:58] today. And there uh apparently is a
[31:01] potential world war starting uh right
[31:04] now. Um can we talk about that a little
[31:06] bit? You are always extremely tapped in
[31:09] uh to kind of geopolitical happenings
[31:11] and I think you have a very good
[31:12] perspective on not just the the let's
[31:15] say mainstream headlines, the legacy
[31:17] media headlines, but like okay, what
[31:19] does this actually mean? What's actually
[31:20] happening behind the scenes? And
[31:21] furthermore, what are the strategic
[31:23] implications of this for the United
[31:25] States as we move forward? So, I mean,
[31:27] what I guess let's start out with what
[31:29] was your initial read on this situation?
[31:32] What like what what's what's top of mind
[31:34] for you as you're seeing this news
[31:35] breaking last night? Let's talk about
[31:38] using Bitcoin the way it's meant to be
[31:40] used. Self-custodial, lightning fast,
[31:43] and ready for the real world. That's
[31:45] exactly what BitKit wallet is all about.
[31:49] Bitkit wallet is a clean, powerful

[33:58] Yeah, it seems like every time missiles
[34:00] start flying, people go, "Is this World
[34:02] War III?" I mean my read of situation is
[34:05] we've kind of been in World War II since
[34:08] you could say co you know if you're
[34:10] being a bit more conspiratorial or at
[34:11] least since the Russia Ukraine war
[34:13] popped off and we just the way great
[34:16] power conflict and um regional conflicts
[34:19] unfold now when you have nuclear powers
[34:23] and a tightly integrated global system
[34:25] that's dominated by elite political
[34:26] factions that function almost as
[34:28] competing mafias. They don't really want
[34:30] to fight head-to-head, right? they don't
[34:33] really want to have to fight, you know,
[34:34] true large-scale kinetic wars with other
[34:36] great powers because those could destroy
[34:38] the whole planet and could certainly
[34:40] lead to massive loss of like wealth for
[34:42] the elites and those political systems.
[34:44] So what we've seen is essentially kind
[34:46] of proxy wars, you know, wars in space,
[34:50] assassinations,
[34:52] sabotage campaigns, cyber attacks, and
[34:55] kind of this um arc of instability
[34:57] across the Eurasian periphery, which
[34:59] sort of, you know, structures this this
[35:01] global conflict that's playing out
[35:02] between, you could say, the Eurasian
[35:04] sort of uh sort of autocratic powers,
[35:07] you know, Russia, China, uh Iran, North
[35:10] Korea, uh and then kind of the legacy
[35:13] sort Western international um sort of
[35:15] security regime you underpinned by the
[35:18] US as the global hegeimon but kind of
[35:20] the great oceanana right kind of you
[35:24] mostly like o mostly just sort of
[35:26] maritime commercial sort of um
[35:28] capitalist countries US Japan South
[35:31] Korea Australia um the UK uh and Israel
[35:36] and so you have kind of this this these
[35:38] like this this sort of meta narrative
[35:40] which is kind of this this competition
[35:42] between uh global orders and kind of um
[35:46] uh insurgent uh powers kind of rising
[35:48] powers wanted to challenge the legacy
[35:50] system and then finding friends right to
[35:53] kind of do you know variations of
[35:56] alignment with and that's kind of maybe
[35:58] what you have with kind of Russia China
[36:00] Iran North Korea um and so you have kind
[36:02] of these local versions of this conflict
[36:04] Russia Ukraine you have other Russian
[36:06] and sort of western conflicts that are
[36:08] much more subrosa in the North Sea in
[36:10] the Arctic and space and other you
[36:13] uh more deniable things and then you
[36:15] have you know the Iran Israel uh kind of
[36:17] flash point that has had lots of other
[36:20] sort of regional manifestations you have
[36:21] Iran Pak sorry you have India Pakistan
[36:23] you have kind of latent conflict you
[36:25] know uh you know that's the subject of a
[36:28] lot of speculation when when or if right
[36:30] between China and Taiwan then you have
[36:32] North Korea um you know always a bit bit
[36:34] of wild card there so you've got kind of
[36:36] this this arc of instability here and
[36:39] you could call that World War II in the
[36:40] sense that it is um it is a they're
[36:43] regional conflicts that have their own
[36:45] sort of local character and their own
[36:46] sort of you know sort of history to that
[36:48] to those to those um you know sort of
[36:52] adversarial relationships but but now
[36:54] they're linked into this global um this
[36:57] global this global frame right uh and
[36:59] that every conflict is bringing in other
[37:02] regional and global powers right it's
[37:04] the reason why Russia Ukraine isn't just
[37:05] a Russia Ukraine thing right it's
[37:07] essentially whole western security
[37:09] apparatus and then Russia getting
[37:10] support from both Iran, uh, North Korea
[37:13] and China, right? This is kind of the
[37:15] globalization of these local conflicts.
[37:17] And so when you say World War II, it's
[37:19] sort of the implication is going back to
[37:20] like other world wars that started
[37:22] local, you know, like AustriaHungary,
[37:24] right? Serbian, you know, assassinations
[37:26] that pulled in more and more belligerent
[37:28] until you had basically the entire
[37:30] world, you know, thrown thrown down. Um,
[37:34] and you know, I think what we've seen
[37:35] thus far is we don't have the same sort
[37:38] of balance of power dynamic where you
[37:39] have all these sort of chains of of of
[37:41] alliance and mutual defense treaties,
[37:43] right? Where it's like all of a sudden
[37:44] one thing pops off and then everyone is
[37:46] going to war. We have article 5 of NATO.
[37:48] That's obviously Ukraine isn't isn't
[37:50] party to. So that's kind of kept it kept
[37:53] it mitigated. Israel, we have uh you
[37:56] know uh sort of mutual defense, but uh
[37:59] you know it's mostly arms supplies like
[38:01] and then depending on how things go like
[38:03] we could get involved. Um so I see this
[38:05] Israel Iran uh conflict it's been
[38:08] playing out for a long time. Um and
[38:12] clearly this was a flash point that the
[38:15] political leadership um decided to take
[38:18] in the context of Trump now coming into
[38:20] office. I think the most recent um
[38:23] indications are one it was immensely
[38:26] successful maybe more successful than
[38:27] than is than Israel even anticipated. Um
[38:30] they wiped out like large swaths of the
[38:33] military uh and scientific
[38:34] establishment. They uh apparently uh had
[38:38] significant strikes on some of the
[38:39] nuclear um enrichment facilities um
[38:43] Matans and Fordau although Ford we'll
[38:45] see if those are deeply buried uh and
[38:48] really kind of embarrassed the Iranians
[38:51] uh basically took down most of the air
[38:52] defense systems and pretty much have
[38:55] been operating unopposed uh in in
[38:57] Iranian skies it seems uh which is a
[39:00] demonstration of just technical prowess
[39:02] right strategic surprise um and builds
[39:05] on sort of, you know, previous sort of
[39:07] Israeli operations of similar sort of,
[39:10] you know, um, strategic stealth, uh,
[39:13] going after the Hezbollah leadership,
[39:14] you know, the Pedro attack. Um, there's
[39:17] various assassinations that they've
[39:18] conducted have been very much sort of
[39:20] precision pinpoint strikes inside Iran.
[39:22] And so, uh, I think Trump, uh, his most
[39:26] recent statements today essentially
[39:27] indicated like, hey, Iran, I gave you 60
[39:30] days. I wanted you to come to the table
[39:33] to negotiate a, you know, grand bargain.
[39:35] I think the contours of that grand
[39:37] bargain were you give up your um
[39:39] ambitions to to uh to a nuclear weapon
[39:42] and we'll help basically facilitate the
[39:44] development of a civilian uh and highly
[39:47] sort of sort of regulated uh nuclear
[39:50] industry. We'll unlock a bunch of you
[39:52] know frozen funds, remove some
[39:54] sanctions, allow you to kind of
[39:55] economically develop and get rich. And
[39:58] um you know and that was like 61 days
[40:01] ago. And so he said 61 days are up and
[40:04] now he gives the green light for BB to
[40:05] go and uh start murking some guys
[40:08] including some of the guys that he said
[40:09] you know were on the other end of this
[40:11] negotiating table and he's like well
[40:13] they're dead now right? And so there's
[40:15] like a kind of a it's it was almost kind
[40:17] of I dark darkly comical in the sense
[40:19] that like Trump was like, you know,
[40:23] almost bragging about the guys that were
[40:25] like being hard asses on the other side
[40:26] of of the negotiating table. They're
[40:28] dead now. So if you want to replace
[40:30] those people, Iran, maybe you should
[40:32] come up you maybe you should send people
[40:33] that are are going to be a bit more
[40:34] cooperative. Um it was it was pretty
[40:37] pretty blatant uh with that. Uh I'm I'm
[40:41] skeptical this will like lead to like a
[40:43] total you know conflration um in the
[40:45] region. I think you know we we've had
[40:48] lots of occasions of missiles flying
[40:49] back and forth. Um, and I think the
[40:52] biggest reason why is that Iran is
[40:54] actually now looks not very strong at
[40:56] all. Right? I didn't see a single, you
[40:59] know, Russian fighter trying to
[41:00] intercept uh uh, you know, an Israeli
[41:03] fighter. And the fact that MSAD was able
[41:04] to operate with a large footprint in
[41:06] country means they had a massive network
[41:07] of incountry facilitators. And the fact
[41:09] that they were able to target so many of
[41:12] these senior military and and and and
[41:14] and uh you know important people um at
[41:17] the same time means that they you know
[41:20] like they can track these people pretty
[41:21] pretty well from the outside but like to
[41:23] get like where they sleep in their
[41:25] bedrooms right like across across like
[41:28] uh all these different cities and hit
[41:30] them all in real time means that they
[41:32] had extremely strong incountry
[41:34] intelligence. In fact, I sort of I
[41:36] somewhat suspect, although it's
[41:38] definitely a little bit more of a
[41:38] speculation, that they probably have um
[41:42] more than just an intelligence network
[41:43] inside the country, but probably have a
[41:45] set of individuals in the political
[41:47] apparatus that are very much opposed to
[41:49] kind of these hardline Islamist faction
[41:51] that wants to take the country to war.
[41:54] And you know, if if Israel is there to
[41:56] kind of wipe out your political
[41:58] opponents for you, you know, all you
[42:00] have to do is like help them out with
[42:02] where they sleep. um and boom, like uh
[42:06] most of your opposition is dead inside
[42:09] the country. It's kind of a win-win for
[42:10] you. So, uh we'll see. I I I'm I think
[42:15] in general like I try to fade
[42:16] geopolitical risk, right? It's always a
[42:18] sell the news um or buy the news, right?
[42:21] Uh event. Um there's obviously failure
[42:24] modes here where very bad very bad
[42:26] things could happen. Like the worst case
[42:28] scenario would be like a an attempt by
[42:30] Iran to try to close the surf.
[42:33] um or to conduct uh you know large-scale
[42:36] terrorist attacks in the west um because
[42:39] if it looks like they can't actually
[42:41] respond kinetically um which it looks
[42:43] like they really can't. They tried
[42:44] launching some drones almost all of them
[42:45] got intercepted um you know their
[42:48] command and control apparatus is
[42:49] basically in tatters they could
[42:50] reconstitute it but we'll see. Um and
[42:53] meanwhile, Israel was able to strike
[42:54] most of their or a lot of their
[42:56] ballistic missiles um and just kind of
[42:59] defang them, it looks like. And we'll
[43:01] see, right? It's been only a day or so,
[43:02] so right be too too too uh too premature
[43:06] in judging it. But if they can't, you
[43:08] know, credibly respond in a way that,
[43:11] you know, allows them to maintain a bit
[43:12] of dignity, um, then they'll, then
[43:15] they'll turn to their asymmetric, um,
[43:17] uh, options, which are, you know,
[43:19] essentially their terror cells that
[43:21] they've established overseas, a lot in
[43:23] South America, a lot even in North
[43:24] America and Western Europe to to attack,
[43:27] you know, sort of softer targets um, and
[43:29] to try to, you know, impose uh, impose
[43:33] pain um, in retaliation. And what that
[43:36] then triggers as a western counter
[43:38] response, you know, depending on how
[43:41] deadly they are, could be the thing that
[43:43] tips over Western public opinion, right,
[43:45] to engage much more militarily in like a
[43:47] regime change operation, which I think
[43:49] is the main thing that is like dividing
[43:51] the kind of MAGA movement or the
[43:53] national security apparatus inside the
[43:54] Trump administration, which is, you
[43:56] know, I think divided between like Iran
[43:58] hawks, the kind of, you know, the
[44:01] Lindsey Grahams of the world that are
[44:02] just like out for out for blood and the
[44:05] folks that even include, you know, Vice
[44:07] President Vance, which is, you know, he
[44:09] was a Marine and his whole um line has
[44:12] been no more, you know, no more foreign
[44:15] wars in the Middle East, right? No more
[44:17] uh, you know, getting getting dragged
[44:19] down into these internal conflicts where
[44:22] it's often the poor that that uh that
[44:24] bleed out uh in the desert um to fight
[44:27] fight for the elites. So,
[44:30] I think there's a strong opposition to
[44:32] US engagement um like uh with boots on
[44:35] the ground or with anything that could
[44:37] trigger a larger conflict. Israel
[44:39] certainly wants to try to bring us in um
[44:40] because if they really want to take out
[44:42] the nuclear program for good and not
[44:43] just set it back a few months, they
[44:45] would need US um strike support. Um and
[44:49] so I think that's what they're trying to
[44:50] angle for. If I and this has been a bit
[44:52] of a rambling assessment, but the last
[44:53] point I would make is I think the the
[44:55] most important thing that Israel is
[44:57] trying to get out of the next few days
[44:58] and weeks as they're going to continue
[45:00] these sort of rolling targeted strikes.
[45:02] Um, one their amount of sorties they can
[45:03] feel is limited. Um, uh, even if
[45:06] they've, you know, established sort of
[45:07] air supremacy, they just don't have it's
[45:09] a long way for those fighters to to to
[45:11] fly. Um and you eventually you know
[45:13] hitting these deeply buried targets is
[45:16] requires munitions that the um Israeli
[45:18] military may not actually have or or
[45:20] have in sufficient quantities to have a
[45:22] strategic effect. So they would might
[45:23] need US munitions or or strike support
[45:27] with these um uh with targeting these
[45:30] these deeply buried facilities like at
[45:31] Fordo um which is like 200 feet in the
[45:34] rock um with the centrifuges. So, I
[45:37] think BB's line here is to Trump now,
[45:42] hey, look, like we we got their pants
[45:44] down. Like, they're vulnerable. Uh, like
[45:47] if you just Annie up just a bit, you
[45:49] know, send a few more strikes in to help
[45:52] take out these facilities, like we can
[45:53] we can turn this from a month-slong set
[45:57] back to a yearslong setback and
[45:59] dramatically improve your negotiating
[46:01] position. And I think for Trump, who is
[46:04] very much always like a, you know, go by
[46:06] his, you know, vibe in the moment kind
[46:09] of decision maker, I could see him
[46:12] getting convinced to support some
[46:14] targeted strikes on some of these uh
[46:16] critical facilities where it's like once
[46:18] you've once you've popped the seal of
[46:20] hitting hitting Iran, uh, and if you're
[46:23] expecting Iran to retaliate kind of
[46:25] regardless, well, you might as well just
[46:27] go all the way right now. Then you then
[46:30] the question is if you knock out their
[46:31] their nuclear program like not for good
[46:33] but like very much substantially then
[46:35] you get to this next point which is then
[46:37] the Israelis go well look we basically
[46:40] pants them we've knocked out their air
[46:41] supremacy we've knocked out the nuclear
[46:44] program we've killed most of their
[46:45] senior generals in both the Kudz force
[46:47] and and the military the chief of staff
[46:49] a lot of the intelligence systems um
[46:52] let's just go for kamini let's just take
[46:54] him out right like fullon you know like
[46:59] regime change. Um, you know, that term
[47:01] regime change, right, has very much like
[47:03] a gets people start to scratch, right?
[47:06] Um, but and that would be like an that
[47:08] would be very much a a radical
[47:10] proposition a few weeks ago. But if you
[47:12] get to this point where each incremental
[47:14] strike looks like it's um easier than
[47:18] you thought, well then actually changing
[47:21] the political environment inside Iran
[47:22] becomes less of a impossible
[47:24] proposition. Um, and there's a lot of
[47:26] people inside the national security
[47:27] apparatus that would like that are going
[47:30] to constantly be chirping in that
[47:32] direction. So, I guess that's the thing
[47:34] to watch. Not World War II, but just
[47:37] does the ratchet of successful strikes
[47:39] increase the chance of US engagement
[47:41] because Trump wants to basically, you
[47:44] know, get the most leverage he can. Um
[47:46] and the last point sorry would be think
[47:49] about Iran in the context of of of of
[47:51] the China um kind of trade war and and
[47:54] negotiations there like there was like
[47:57] that's the main dynamic that Trump is
[47:59] kind of concerned by in the sense that
[48:00] China has a lot of leverage over us. We
[48:01] have a lot of a lot of leverage over
[48:03] China were somewhat equally matched like
[48:06] we basically came came to blows
[48:08] liberation day massive tariffs almost a
[48:10] mutual embargo that started creating
[48:13] almost economic catastrophe inside China
[48:15] because you have entire cities that are
[48:17] just like you know now don't have an
[48:19] economic purpose if they can't export
[48:20] and so there's a lot of in potential
[48:22] internal you know instability being
[48:23] triggered as well as financial
[48:25] instability in the west right if you
[48:27] have inflation you have bond market
[48:28] instability you have 5% plus you know
[48:30] 30-year you know, Besson started
[48:32] getting, you know, worried about high
[48:33] high move index, sort of mutually
[48:35] assured economic destruction. And so we
[48:37] kind of came to the table in Geneva and
[48:39] then just had the most recent, you know,
[48:41] meetings and phone calls to try to, you
[48:43] know, reccalibrate, come to a quote
[48:44] deal. And a lot of it was like the rare
[48:46] earth stuff, the Chinese students stuff.
[48:49] But I think Trump wasn't like a master
[48:52] planner looking at all the, you know,
[48:54] advantages and disadvantages. He just
[48:55] was like, let's go for it. Let's figure
[48:57] it out. And now he's I think he's now
[48:58] discovered kind of just how much um
[49:02] leverage uh China has over us and also
[49:04] how much leverage maybe we have over
[49:05] them but like where where the actual
[49:07] points of leverage and and pain are. And
[49:10] I think he's looking at Iran and
[49:11] realizing that Iran exports two billion
[49:13] two sorry 2 million barrels of oil a day
[49:15] mostly to China. Um you know and if
[49:19] China's choking off your rare earths
[49:21] maybe you can you know help choke off
[49:23] some of their energy some of their
[49:25] energy supply right. So, it's like
[49:26] another another sort of asymmetric way
[49:28] to kind of, you know, get additional um
[49:30] sort of bargaining power over your main
[49:32] rival, which is China here. So, anyways,
[49:34] that's I'll stop talking. No, I
[49:37] appreciate the analysis. I I I did just
[49:38] want uh when because you mentioned
[49:41] Lindsey Graham, I just thought of uh
[49:42] this the Holden Blood Feast uh meme uh
[49:46] which just gets gets me every time. But
[49:49] I I I digress. Every time I see that
[49:51] meme though, it's like, "Oh, oh, that's
[49:52] that's Lindsy Grim." Um, so I mean I
[49:55] think that's an interesting perspective.
[49:56] Basically this idea that because you see
[49:58] a lot of sensationalism because talking
[50:00] about World War II uh definitely gets
[50:02] clicks and views and engagement and so
[50:05] much of our attention-based online
[50:07] economy is literally just run by that.
[50:09] It's run by, okay, how are you going to
[50:11] get the most eyeballs on this? And
[50:12] usually sensationalizing and
[50:14] catastrophizing and uh, you know, let's
[50:17] say dumerism tends to get more than,
[50:19] hey, this isn't so bad. actually this is
[50:22] pretty much just status, you know, uh
[50:24] status quo as it's been and we can all
[50:26] like freak out a little bit less because
[50:28] really there hasn't been much of a
[50:29] change. Uh so I think you you you really
[50:32] need to work on your fear-mongering uh
[50:34] Matt, you know, like really step that up
[50:36] a little bit uh to get those those sweet
[50:38] uh those sweet eyeballs. But no, I I
[50:40] appreciate that perspective because it
[50:42] is interesting. It's it's basically we
[50:44] we're not uh seeing the beginning of
[50:46] World War II here because for all, you
[50:48] know, intents and purposes, we've been
[50:50] in World War II. We've been in a state
[50:52] of basically uh global conflict in a
[50:56] regionally distributed way for many
[50:58] years. And that's, you know, it's it's
[51:01] this a lot of the, you know, the same uh
[51:03] the same cast of characters that's back
[51:05] at it again. And is this time different?
[51:08] I mean, we don't have a crystal ball.
[51:10] Who knows? But uh it it certainly uh it
[51:14] seems to rhyme with the pastimes. So
[51:16] I'll be interested to see how this
[51:17] develops. I am curious if you think this
[51:20] has any sort of uh let's say uh
[51:23] macroeconomic
[51:25] implications as far as okay, you know,
[51:29] uh new wars or you know, quote, wars uh
[51:33] sparking up all over the place. Boy, it
[51:37] seems to be that usually when there's
[51:38] more conflicts, there tends to be more
[51:40] uh liquidity injected globally uh in the
[51:43] US of course, but not just in the US. Is
[51:46] this like h how do you think this plays
[51:48] out? I mean, do we start to see we've
[51:50] been in relatively restrictive,
[51:52] relatively tight monetary conditions in
[51:54] terms of global liquidity for a while,
[51:56] basically most of Biden's admin, you
[51:58] started to see global liquidity, you
[52:00] know, and US uh liquidity as well tick
[52:02] up a little bit recently. So, I guess
[52:05] maybe a different way of putting that
[52:07] is, you know, is uh is quote World War
[52:09] III good for Bitcoin? And I mean that in
[52:12] the least uh least callous way possible.
[52:16] Yes. I mean, so obviously there's event
[52:18] trades you could put on around the your
[52:20] speculation over uh this particular
[52:23] flashoint. That's maybe, you know, not
[52:25] my forte, right? In terms of whether
[52:26] you're going to have a collar spread on
[52:28] Brent crude or the VIX or whatever,
[52:29] right? I'm not running a hedge fund
[52:31] there. But structurally um you know I
[52:34] think it's clear and this has been the
[52:36] environment we've been in really since
[52:38] the Russia Ukraine invasion is just the
[52:40] securization of the global economic
[52:42] system right like the general shift and
[52:44] the balance from you know marketdriven
[52:47] principles to state driven prerogatives
[52:50] where national leadership looks at the
[52:52] economy not as like a battle not not as
[52:55] a a field for competitiveness and
[52:57] innovation and trade but for like
[53:00] strategic adv advantage or leverage over
[53:02] an adversary. And so like capital
[53:04] markets become weaponized, supply chains
[53:07] become weaponized. And so in that
[53:09] environment where everyone is looking at
[53:12] their neighbors and realizing, can I
[53:13] trust you? Either my historical ally or
[53:16] a potential more new aggressive and um
[53:19] empowered adversary as well as
[53:21] technology change that lowers the
[53:22] barrier to um accomplish strategic
[53:26] effects. Right? We've seen, you know,
[53:28] the Russia, sorry, the Ukraine kind of
[53:30] pop up kamicazi drone attacks that took
[53:32] out, you know, large swats of the
[53:34] strategic bomber fleet inside inside uh
[53:37] Russia as just an indicator of just how
[53:40] the overall security environment is
[53:41] changing. And that is now changing how
[53:43] governments react, right, in terms of
[53:45] their their fiscal prerogatives, right?
[53:47] When your when your back is against the
[53:49] wall, like your focus is on, you know,
[53:52] spending money on defense, on reshoring
[53:54] supply chains, on if you can't trust as
[53:58] much in the global commons as much as
[53:59] you could, then that sort of Ricardian
[54:02] advantage becomes less of a thing you
[54:04] focus on, you want to have more
[54:05] resilience in supply chains, more
[54:08] domestic industry, um more uh buffers,
[54:12] right? You want to accumulate, you want,
[54:14] you know, more reserves of gold, of
[54:17] foreign exchange, of commodities. You
[54:19] want to have as much of your national
[54:21] champions, you know, privileged over o
[54:24] over adversaries. Um, so you're just
[54:27] going to spend a lot more money on
[54:28] industrial policy, on reshoring, on, you
[54:31] know, these things also are somewhat
[54:33] controversial domestically. So you need
[54:34] to make sure that like the domestic
[54:36] population doesn't face austerity,
[54:38] right? Normally you would see fiscal
[54:40] contraction after you have a period of
[54:42] kind of fiscal large s as we saw after
[54:43] the stimulus wave in 2020. We never saw
[54:46] that. In fact, we've had continuous
[54:47] fiscal deficits. Um I think it's because
[54:50] the the political leadership knows
[54:52] implicit or explicitly like the
[54:54] population will not take austerity well,
[54:56] right? Like we're already having riots,
[54:58] you know, with like low employment and
[55:00] pretty good inflation numbers and like
[55:02] pretty good GDP prints. like
[55:04] economically you know obviously there's
[55:06] a high high um segmentation between the
[55:08] halves and the have nots in the US and
[55:11] around the western world um but just
[55:13] like objectively speaking right like uh
[55:15] like real incomes are pretty pretty you
[55:17] know pretty climbing but if you if you
[55:19] turned right if if real incomes went
[55:21] down if inflation went up if if
[55:23] unemployment went up like that powder
[55:25] keg of our civil society could be quite
[55:27] dangerous and so I think political
[55:28] leadership just knows we have to keep
[55:30] spending money right like there's a like
[55:32] I think Lyn Alden says nothing stopped
[55:34] his train. Um, for just like the the the
[55:37] mechanical logic of the relation between
[55:39] the fiscal balance sheet now and asset
[55:41] prices and the fact that, you know, tax
[55:42] receipts are now the marginal driver of
[55:44] fiscal deficits. And so you need to have
[55:46] asset prices continue to go up in order
[55:48] to have just the math work out. Um, and
[55:50] then you have all these, you know,
[55:51] embedded obligations, but then on top of
[55:53] that, you have a much, you know, more
[55:55] risky environment, more defense
[55:57] spending, um, you know, retiring
[55:58] boomers, like everything is basically
[56:00] more money printing, right? And we're
[56:03] doing all of this in an environment
[56:04] where like the global collateral is a
[56:06] sovereign debt market underpinned by the
[56:07] US Treasury, you know, security which we
[56:09] are, you know, printing like hand over
[56:12] fist and we know we can't really issue
[56:13] too much at the long end uh without
[56:15] seeing rates spike. So we have to push
[56:17] more out in the front end which is
[56:18] effectively cash like you know um you
[56:21] know securities which is basically
[56:23] inflationary. Uh and so yeah it's like
[56:25] it's like that meme of like you know
[56:27] Bitcoin tracking to the M2 like like
[56:29] money supply. It's like I actually think
[56:32] it's it's it's not like a causal link. I
[56:34] think it's almost like a meta meme which
[56:35] is because it's like it's like the the
[56:37] bell curve is is like oh Bitcoin is just
[56:39] a correlate to to M2 and it's like no no
[56:42] Bitcoin the money supply is blah blah
[56:44] blah. It's like well actually everyone's
[56:46] looking at the global liquidity
[56:47] environment and they need like a simple,
[56:48] you know, meme to attach their
[56:50] justification for Bitcoin, you know,
[56:52] Bitcoin's price and they'll just go with
[56:53] that. Um and yeah, Bitcoin is
[56:56] effectively a liquidity gauge in the
[56:58] global global system. Uh, and everyone's
[57:00] basically have to print their way out of
[57:01] it. Um, there's just no way no way
[57:03] around it at this point. So, yeah, never
[57:06] go up.
[57:08] I mean, I I appreciate that. It is
[57:11] amazing how well Lyn Alden's Nothing
[57:13] Stops This Train uh mimemetic thesis is
[57:16] holding up. Like, really kudos to Lynn
[57:19] because And I I love seeing this get
[57:21] picked up by like uh u just more and
[57:24] more people too. It's it's it's nice to
[57:26] watch. It's like and you feel like you
[57:28] kind of like knew about this meme before
[57:29] it was cool, you know, and like, you
[57:31] know, now Lynn's this rockstar and it's
[57:33] like I'm just happy to see her crushing
[57:35] it. Um, but yeah, so I'm, you know,
[57:40] it's going to be very interesting to see
[57:42] how things continue to play out. I think
[57:44] it's, you know, almost uh
[57:47] everybody seems to believe we are in the
[57:49] midst of this fourth turning, right? Uh,
[57:51] and I think that's like from a if we're
[57:54] going based on the theory like yes that
[57:56] like the timelines match up I think
[57:58] we're seeing actually sort of a
[57:59] convergence of cycles as at the current
[58:03] point like where we have I don't know if
[58:05] you're familiar with uh Pibius's
[58:07] ancycosis this is like you know couple
[58:09] thousand years old but we're reaching
[58:11] like the aglocracy stage of you know uh
[58:14] end of democracy towards mob rule and
[58:16] like you could also say that that's
[58:18] coinciding with like Ray Dalio's you
[58:19] know long-term debt cycles and all of
[58:21] these things kind of converging at once
[58:23] at this time where we also have this
[58:25] insanely disruptive technology uh both
[58:29] on the let's say on the AI front uh on
[58:31] the uh you know autonomous uh and
[58:34] asymmetric warfare front with drones
[58:35] like we've now really seen a
[58:37] demonstration of that power between you
[58:39] know some uh waring nations uh Ukraine
[58:42] and and Russia you also have a monetary
[58:46] revolution happening that was happening
[58:48] kind of quietly for for some years, you
[58:50] know, just the nerds playing with their
[58:51] playing with their bitcoins, but now
[58:53] this is center stage and people are
[58:54] talking about it and it's like so much
[58:57] stuff is happening at once amidst this
[59:01] uh nothing stops this train moment of
[59:03] hey we have to keep printing or it all
[59:05] falls apart.
[59:08] Where does it go from here? like does it
[59:10] all fall apart or does the government uh
[59:12] let's say the US government but like
[59:14] global governments more broadly do they
[59:16] have the ability to keep kicking the can
[59:17] down the road indefinitely or does
[59:20] something have to give and like does it
[59:22] just because nothing stops this train
[59:24] doesn't mean that train doesn't run out
[59:25] of track and fly off a cliff it just
[59:27] means they can't break before it so I'm
[59:29] curious what your read is is there any
[59:31] way to uh quote you know have a soft
[59:33] landing on our way out of this fourth
[59:35] turning or is it just it is what it
[59:39] Yeah, this where I actually think the
[59:41] monetary aspect of this is less
[59:45] radical than like the social
[59:46] geopolitical aspects of this because you
[59:48] like you could see Bitcoin at a million
[59:50] dollars and gold at 10,000 and the world
[59:54] would kind of work almost the same way
[59:56] it does now for most people, right? Like
[59:59] people holding Bitcoin, people holding
[60:00] gold would feel much richer. Um but like
[60:02] the relative sh it would just be a
[60:04] marginal rebalancing of like capital
[60:05] pools like a few percentage points and
[60:08] you know tens of hundreds of trillions
[60:10] of dollars in global assets just
[60:11] marginally shifting to these harder
[60:13] assets and and you could be we'd be in a
[60:15] world where Bitcoin is you know 10 times
[60:17] higher or more um and from Bitcoin's
[60:20] perspective that would be like a you
[60:21] know pretty transformational thing but I
[60:23] think from because we're so focused on
[60:25] it like we overindex on that one
[60:27] variable and you know think about global
[60:29] change but global change in history is a
[60:32] very nonlinear process and it's failure
[60:35] modes are like specific breakdown you
[60:39] know global war and famine and you know
[60:42] like absolute state collapse I don't
[60:45] think we're in for that so when people
[60:47] say forth turning you know Radalio's
[60:49] thesis they're pointing to kind of
[60:52] long-term debt cycles political cycles
[60:54] generational cycles and they you know
[60:57] all all indicate periods of turbulence
[60:58] and instability and system change and
[61:01] you know but it doesn't necessarily
[61:02] determine well what what's the nature of
[61:04] that system change like at that phase
[61:05] transition how unstable is it right
[61:07] because we have we have modes in history
[61:09] where we've seen very very unstable
[61:11] modes where basically civilization
[61:13] almost collapses you get dark ages you
[61:15] get you know massive population fall off
[61:17] and then there's versions that are just
[61:19] essentially like you know just difficult
[61:21] periods in history you know civil wars
[61:23] but you know or like handoffs from like
[61:26] the UK to the US uh and we read them out
[61:30] of our history books, but people living
[61:31] through them, unless you were like
[61:33] really unlucky or in a particular
[61:35] particularly vulnerable spot, right? You
[61:38] you know, you kind of made it through,
[61:39] right? It wasn't like a end of the
[61:40] world, right? And I think that's
[61:43] sometimes people don't um like lay out
[61:45] those scenarios, right? Like forth
[61:47] turning, instability, global war. Oh,
[61:49] it's kind of this the system is going to
[61:50] collapse kind of thing. And I don't
[61:52] think the system's going to collapse. Um
[61:54] cuz when people say that like actual
[61:56] systems collapse means global supply
[61:58] chains collapse which means just in time
[61:59] delivery collapse which means we get no
[62:01] more advanced microchips which means
[62:03] most of our much of our food supply
[62:05] right becomes imperiled which means our
[62:07] population probably shrinks which means
[62:08] like our standard of living dramatically
[62:10] shrinks like that's a very very bad
[62:12] outcome like that's a terrifying outcome
[62:13] I don't believe that is like a probable
[62:16] if not you know above like 1% scenario
[62:19] but I think we are entering a period
[62:21] where what we think of as like the
[62:24] legitimate institutions in society are
[62:26] being um are being uh shaken up, right?
[62:30] Which is I think the single most
[62:31] important feature of these sorts of
[62:32] forth turning generational um cycles is
[62:35] that you have a characteristic process
[62:38] of kind of institutional creation that
[62:41] um you could say go back to like the
[62:42] 1930s and 40s. you know, the generation
[62:46] that fought World War II that came out
[62:48] of of that conflict, you know, with kind
[62:50] of this mandate to run the global
[62:52] system, they built new institutions like
[62:54] built the national security state. They
[62:56] built um, you know, the federal
[62:58] government up. They built uh
[62:59] international institutions. And the
[63:01] first generation had a lot of momentum,
[63:03] sort of technical and technocratic
[63:05] capacity. They had a lot of unity as a
[63:07] as a as a as a generational cohort in
[63:10] the elite managing this new system as it
[63:13] was sort of, you know, growing and had a
[63:15] lot of energy and momentum behind it and
[63:17] it had a sense of purpose and creation.
[63:19] And you can kind of see that, right? And
[63:21] then they hand it off to the second
[63:22] generation and they're kind of like, oh,
[63:23] they were trained by the first
[63:25] generation. they kind of understood, you
[63:27] know, kind of the ethos, the the
[63:29] heristics involved in managing a
[63:31] complicated new institutional apparatus
[63:34] um and kind of, you know, adapting it to
[63:36] a changing environment. Then they hand
[63:37] off to the third generation and it gets
[63:39] kind of attenuated and they maybe are
[63:41] just kind of like caretakers of it. They
[63:42] don't really understand its original
[63:44] founding purpose. Maybe they're not as
[63:46] like the best and the brightest anymore
[63:47] because best and the brightest go off
[63:49] into like build new things, right? The
[63:51] third generation inside these
[63:52] institutions are kind of like here's the
[63:54] rules, follow the rules and that selects
[63:56] for a certain type of person that just
[63:57] likes to execute rules and you have
[64:00] institutions managed by those types of
[64:01] people after a while they start to kind
[64:03] of become less effective right they
[64:05] don't adapt well to changing conditions
[64:07] they become uh you know sclerotic sort
[64:09] of rulebound and then they reach you
[64:12] know a point of fragility and when the
[64:13] environment basically gives them a
[64:14] crisis and they can't respond to it and
[64:16] that's when the fourth generation has
[64:18] that's either in the institution that
[64:19] goes oh this thing is totally cooked
[64:21] right? Uh and they go, well, either we
[64:23] need to like break this down to the
[64:24] studs and rebuild it or exit and build
[64:28] new institutions. And that's I think the
[64:29] environment we're in right now. And I
[64:30] think there's a, you know, a
[64:32] distribution of people that are in
[64:33] different positions that either see the
[64:35] existing institutions as sort of still
[64:37] having a kind of a skeleton worth worth
[64:39] um worth saving and they sort of to
[64:41] strip out, you know, all the say woke
[64:43] woke woke nonsense, but there's a core
[64:45] ethos. is a core um you know substance
[64:48] that needs to be uh you know rebuilt
[64:50] upon and there's others that a bit maybe
[64:52] more sort of uh sort of radically
[64:54] inclined that are saying oh no no no
[64:56] this needs to be start we need to start
[64:57] fresh right the legacy institutions were
[64:59] designed for fundamentally different era
[65:01] they're fundamentally corrupted they're
[65:02] fundamentally not fit for fit for
[65:04] purpose anymore we need to start start
[65:06] sort of denovo and I'm I'm kind of like
[65:08] a not eitheror type of person I'm like a
[65:11] you know there are institutions we need
[65:12] to save and sort of rebuild and there
[65:14] also I think new institutions we need to
[65:16] create, right, that the existing
[65:17] apparatus can't can't deliver, right? Uh
[65:20] and so I think Bitcoin is this
[65:21] interesting interplay, right, between
[65:24] the old and the new, right? It certainly
[65:25] is a fundamentally new type of
[65:26] institution itself, but it's sort of,
[65:28] you know, going through and sort of
[65:29] almost co-opting and maybe remaking, you
[65:32] know, existing institutions, right? And
[65:34] and that's I think part of the
[65:35] contention inside the Bitcoin community
[65:36] is uh how much of this is state
[65:38] co-option versus, you know, are we
[65:40] taking over the state, right? uh and
[65:43] it's kind of I think it's ambiguous at
[65:45] the moment, right? It doesn't it's not a
[65:46] clear answer to that question, right? Is
[65:49] is is because when you have that sort of
[65:51] interpenetration, right, it's it's never
[65:54] clear, well, who's going to is it is it
[65:56] this going to take over this or is this
[65:57] going to take over this or is the new
[65:59] thing that gets created out of that out
[66:01] of that um that that sort of dynamic? Uh
[66:04] is it just a new thing, right? And it's
[66:05] kind of hard to say, well, who won or
[66:07] who lost or who co-opted who? there's
[66:09] just a new thing that got created that
[66:10] the people involved in it feel is a new
[66:13] thing that's that's legitimate and that
[66:14] has has sort of new new sort of energy
[66:18] to to you know restructure the world
[66:20] system. So that's that's why I think
[66:22] Bitcoin is be like very very important
[66:24] to my mind is because it's not only is
[66:26] it like an ethos and a political
[66:27] movement but it's it's uh it's a vortex
[66:30] for actual financial capital which is to
[66:33] first order political capital right and
[66:35] so you have this this this this
[66:37] mimemetic engine that is like attracting
[66:40] people capital and is now kind of now
[66:42] swirling in and bringing in you know s
[66:44] wealth funds and black rocks and
[66:46] presidents and you know like staffers
[66:49] for central banks like we're having feds
[66:50] you know, Fed staffers come to our
[66:52] Bitcoin policy summit. Like this is this
[66:54] like like black hole that's that's like
[66:57] that's that's accreing here. Um and uh
[67:00] yeah, I don't know. I I don't try to
[67:02] project out too far because I think
[67:03] people when we try to project out three,
[67:05] five, 10 years, we always look at our
[67:07] current system and we just think, oh,
[67:09] it's going to be like that but with
[67:10] like, you know, better screens like and
[67:14] I think when you're in these phase
[67:15] transitions,
[67:17] you know, a lot of the things that you
[67:18] think are going to survive don't and
[67:21] it's kind of not obvious like what makes
[67:23] it through and what adapts. Um, so I try
[67:26] not to make predictions. I think the
[67:27] basic lesson I have from Bitcoin is you
[67:29] have to be a kind of a very adaptive
[67:31] system right in that environment. The
[67:33] reason why I think Bitcoin not just for
[67:34] these money printing reasons is likely
[67:36] to succeed um in fact you know
[67:38] accelerate through this phase transition
[67:40] this sort of forth turning generational
[67:42] you know sort of reset whatever you want
[67:43] to call it is it's sort of the sort of
[67:46] synquinon of a self- adaptive corrective
[67:48] system. There's no central point of
[67:49] failure. There's no committee that's
[67:50] deciding that's planning. And when the
[67:53] environment is changing so radically,
[67:54] you know, those sorts of centrally
[67:56] planned, you know, technocratically
[67:58] managed institutions are extremely
[68:00] vulnerable because you have the smartest
[68:02] and the best and the brightest, it's
[68:03] hard to keep up, right? It's hard to
[68:05] make the right decisions in real time,
[68:07] especially in a complicated, you know,
[68:09] global environment. So, Bitcoin is just
[68:10] this thing that can just adapt, right?
[68:12] And it will respond. It will go up and
[68:14] down, but as a network, right, it's kind
[68:16] of self-healing. It's kind of it's it's
[68:17] highly redundant and resilient. Um
[68:20] that's that's like a model to structure
[68:22] what I would call like sociotechnical
[68:24] institutions, right, for an era of
[68:26] digital disruption, right? Right? You
[68:28] have lots of accelerating change in AI,
[68:30] in sort of global networks, trade,
[68:32] technology, communications being sort of
[68:35] reconfigured as, you know, all these
[68:37] things happen and and geopol
[68:39] geopolitical conflict accelerates. And
[68:40] you need something like Bitcoin, I
[68:42] think, you know, as like a as like a a
[68:45] new network kind of um establishing a
[68:47] structural mesh around which new
[68:49] institutions can kind of be be like be
[68:51] catalyzed, right? And like capital is an
[68:53] important thing to fund new
[68:54] institutions, right? like a bunch of
[68:56] rebels can like show up to like a
[68:59] ramshackle, you know, hole in the woods
[69:01] and be like, "We're going to take down
[69:02] the federal government." It's like, "All
[69:03] right, good luck, guys." Right? Um, but
[69:06] when you have like the elites of a
[69:08] system with billionaires and lots of
[69:09] capital to go, oh, we're going to
[69:11] restructure the like the political
[69:12] environment, we're going to build new
[69:14] institutions. Well, that's that's how
[69:16] that's the history of all human
[69:17] institutions. That's literally what like
[69:18] the story of the foundations of, you
[69:20] know, all the major countries and and
[69:22] political systems uh is. Um and uh and
[69:25] that's just I think the process we're
[69:26] we're seeing play out.
[69:28] It just as you were uh saying that you
[69:31] know is the question of uh are we co-op
[69:33] is Bitcoin cooped in the state or is the
[69:34] state co-opting Bitcoin? It just makes
[69:35] me think of that meme that's like you
[69:37] know uh you know I'm not trapped in here
[69:39] with you like you're trapped in here
[69:40] with me like that that that's Bitcoin
[69:41] right there basically being like you
[69:43] know like you you think you're co-opting
[69:45] it but really you yourself are being
[69:46] co-opted. You don't change Bitcoin.
[69:48] Bitcoin changes you. Uh I that's that's
[69:52] all of the uh the the let's say cliches
[69:55] I have uh on that subject. But no I I
[69:58] think that it's going to be fascinating
[70:00] to see how not just the United States
[70:03] who has obviously taken a early lead in
[70:06] this uh in this let's say Bitcoin race.
[70:09] Uh not as early as El Salvador but in
[70:11] terms El Salvador is you know it's a a
[70:13] great country and they've done
[70:14] incredible things but it's very very
[70:15] small compared to the United States
[70:17] obviously. Um, I'm curious if you see
[70:21] with all of these, you know, these
[70:23] geopolitical tensions, these different
[70:24] flash points that you've that you've
[70:25] touched on and explained in this kind
[70:27] of, you know, belt of of instability,
[70:29] all of these different powder kegs sort
[70:31] of popping off. If you see there being
[70:34] more of an incentive for, let's say, a
[70:36] flight to a neutral reserve asset like
[70:38] Bitcoin or perhaps it's a neutral
[70:39] reserve asset like gold because it's
[70:41] what people know. And something that I
[70:43] think we may have talked about a little
[70:45] bit and like eight months ago when you
[70:46] were last in the show, but this idea of
[70:49] okay, strategically if there's a move
[70:51] towards a global reserve asset and the
[70:53] United States has gold, the United
[70:55] States has Bitcoin, American citizens
[70:57] have gold, American citizens have
[70:58] Bitcoin,
[71:00] what makes more sense to put your
[71:03] economic weight behind as a nation
[71:05] state? uh if you're the United States or
[71:07] if you're one of these other countries,
[71:09] you know, for China and Russia, maybe
[71:11] it's gold because I think Bitcoin is
[71:12] also somewhat uh ideologically
[71:15] incompatible with an authoritarian
[71:17] state. Like they can it's not that they
[71:19] won't use it, but it's ideologically
[71:22] ideologically incompatible with how that
[71:24] state is organized. I think it's
[71:25] ideologically much more compatible with
[71:28] the United States. So, do you see do you
[71:31] see a shift away from the dollar as the
[71:33] global reserve currencies to a neutral
[71:35] reserve asset like gold or bitcoin? And
[71:37] do you see the United States with these
[71:39] moves it's making right now with Bitcoin
[71:41] strategic reserve uh all the work you
[71:43] guys are doing how tapped into you are
[71:45] do you see this as actually being
[71:46] something that that legitimately
[71:49] replaces gold or that the US puts its
[71:51] economic weight behind because there is
[71:52] more strategic benefit in supporting a
[71:55] Bitcoin reserve asset for international
[71:58] trade even versus a gold as a neutral
[72:01] reserve asset which many of our uh let's
[72:04] say enemies have quite a bit of versus
[72:07] how much Bitcoin they have
[72:08] proportionally if that makes sense.
[72:11] Yes. No, if I just do the numbers, we uh
[72:14] collectively as American government,
[72:16] American companies, ETFs, individual
[72:18] holders probably have between 30 and 40%
[72:21] of the total available Bitcoin supply.
[72:23] Uh and we probably have about 8 to 10%
[72:26] of the total above ground gold stock. So
[72:29] if you're just thinking about scenarios
[72:31] in the next three to five years where
[72:32] hard assets like gold and bitcoin are
[72:35] going to be, you know, increasingly
[72:36] monetized in the global financial and
[72:40] kind of official government sector, uh
[72:43] that's kind of your starting condition,
[72:45] right? And if you had no other
[72:46] considerations and you're just a
[72:47] national security guy, you're thinking
[72:48] in the next 5 years like if we have two
[72:51] hard assets that are going to get
[72:53] monetized, which one do we stand to gain
[72:56] more from? It's like pretty obvious we
[72:58] stand to gain more from Bitcoin relative
[72:59] to gold. Uh and Bitcoin tends to move
[73:02] like much faster than gold. So if you
[73:06] you know it's not necessarily an
[73:07] eitheror. It's like a both and sort of
[73:09] situation because I think there's also
[73:10] the second order effects you have to
[73:12] consider which is the current system is
[73:14] highly leveraged to gold as a reserve
[73:17] asset. It's already institutionalized.
[73:19] It's already kind of integrated into
[73:21] international frameworks, central banks.
[73:23] It's well trusted. It's kind of a known
[73:25] thing. And so you kind of have to do
[73:28] like a measured mix, right? A mix of the
[73:32] the old standby that's high that's
[73:34] highly, you know, derisked and wellknown
[73:37] and, you know, everyone's comfortable
[73:38] with it in those existing institutions
[73:40] and you don't want to just break those
[73:42] institutions. You don't just want to,
[73:44] you know, create more uncertainty and
[73:46] instability because people aren't ready
[73:47] for the new thing. So you have to kind
[73:49] of have this gradual transition where
[73:50] you let kind of both monetize. But I
[73:53] think they also see the strategic
[73:55] advantage uh that's quite asymmetric
[73:57] that we have for Bitcoin relative to
[73:59] gold, right? Four to one in just present
[74:01] holdings and probably an additional I
[74:03] don't know five to one in terms of how
[74:05] fast it's going to go. So maybe that's a
[74:06] 20 to1 relative advantage between
[74:08] allowing you know gold to go to say five
[74:11] or six or $10,000 and allowing Bitcoin
[74:14] to go to a million or$2 million. Um and
[74:17] then you up in a world where gold is
[74:19] still probably the primary reserve
[74:20] asset. Bitcoin is like a close second uh
[74:23] in terms of a hard asset, right? I think
[74:25] in that environment though, this isn't
[74:27] the end of the dollar, right? Like gold
[74:29] at 10,000 and Bitcoin at a million or
[74:31] two million isn't the end of the dollar.
[74:32] I think that's what people sometimes,
[74:34] you know, uh sort of overstate because
[74:37] the dollar is a network. The dollar as a
[74:38] mean of exchange and unit of account,
[74:40] you know, interpenetrating, you know,
[74:42] global foreign exchange swaps, interest
[74:44] rate forwards, and global trade finance.
[74:46] That's not going away anytime soon,
[74:48] right? And like even this bullish
[74:49] scenario of Bitcoin at a million dollars
[74:51] is like maybe Bitcoin helps helps like
[74:54] facilitate single-digit percentage
[74:56] points of international trade maybe.
[74:58] Right? And that gets still that's still
[74:59] a world with the Bitcoin at a million
[75:00] dollars plus right? So I think people
[75:02] need to think about the numbers here.
[75:03] The numbers matter for these like
[75:05] general statements about shifts in the
[75:06] global system. Uh and I don't think the
[75:08] dollar is going away as a global reserve
[75:10] currency. think are this geopolitical
[75:12] fracturing a multicurrency sort of world
[75:15] order in terms of how nations store
[75:17] their wealth um that will be
[75:19] increasingly geopolitically contingent.
[75:20] So the folks that the US can still kind
[75:23] of keep inside its tech tariff and
[75:24] security zone, right? That it kind of uh
[75:27] you know re-securizes,
[75:29] right? And essentially says you want
[75:32] access to our advanced technology, our
[75:33] AI systems and our other spooky stuff.
[75:36] You want uh to be protected by our
[75:37] nuclear umbrella, you want the US
[75:40] military to secure global trade, you're
[75:42] going to have to essentially help
[75:43] underwrite that security commons. And
[75:45] that means you have to hold our debt.
[75:48] And there's, you know, all sorts of
[75:49] complicated negotiations happening right
[75:50] now on on that basis, right? Like with
[75:52] Japan, for example, the reason why Japan
[75:54] and and the UK are actually buying more
[75:56] debt, uh, right, even though they're
[75:58] kind of not in the best shape
[75:59] themselves, is because we're sort of
[76:00] forcing them to. Uh, and we might set up
[76:03] like a joint sovereign wealth fund with
[76:04] like with Japan where, you know, we sort
[76:06] of stuff a bunch of long longdated bonds
[76:08] in there and it's kind of a, you know,
[76:10] it's a it's an obscured way of kind of
[76:12] doing QE of sort of monetizing debt.
[76:14] We're doing a various series of duration
[76:16] swaps. Um, that's kind of what I would
[76:19] expect is for the Treasury market to
[76:21] become less a global market, less a
[76:25] thing that greases global the global
[76:27] financial system. Um, and I think the
[76:29] senior policy makers in Trump administ
[76:31] Trump administration are even saying
[76:32] that that's what they want. They want to
[76:33] impose like a tax on essentially foreign
[76:36] holders of of of US bonds. They want um
[76:40] they don't want there to be this kind of
[76:41] dollar Dutch disease that has undermined
[76:43] the defense industrial base and led to
[76:45] this uh sort of imbalanced trade system
[76:47] where China has all the manufacturing
[76:48] and we have all the debt. Um especially
[76:50] when you're rivals. So they want to
[76:53] change that system. So they both have a
[76:55] strategic policy objective to change
[76:57] that system to move away from the
[76:58] Treasury security as a fundamental
[77:00] collateral uh you know liquid and safe
[77:02] asset. they still want it to be there,
[77:04] you know, strong enough within a certain
[77:06] regime where it's kind of like you can
[77:08] impose financial repression on other
[77:09] balance sheets and not your domestic
[77:10] population. So, you know, the
[77:12] Australians and the the Japanese and the
[77:14] South Koreans and the Taiwanese and some
[77:16] of the Middle Eastern partners and and
[77:18] Western Europe are are going to be kind
[77:20] of, you know, depending depending on how
[77:22] much how clever we are and how much
[77:24] force we have, we can kind of, you know,
[77:26] stuff this stuff these these uh these
[77:28] losses into their balance sheets. But,
[77:31] but that's kind of what they're going to
[77:32] do. They just bring that GDP from 120 to
[77:34] like 70 or 80. So run the economy a
[77:36] little bit hot. Um I think a lot of it
[77:39] is also potentially
[77:42] like how bad like how much how much pain
[77:44] they have to impose is is like how
[77:46] actually does AI play in here? Like do
[77:48] do we actually get um the massive
[77:51] productivity breakthrough, right? Uh
[77:53] with with robotics and AI. Um, and uh, I
[77:57] mean, at the end of the day, in in the
[77:58] 2030s, all this conversation is going to
[78:00] be moot anyways, cuz a lot of things are
[78:02] are are going to happen that we've
[78:03] talked about in other in other episodes
[78:04] that are going to be they're going to
[78:05] run render the sort of fiscal
[78:06] projections out the 2040. Like, you guys
[78:08] are smoking. Uh, like, yeah, we're we're
[78:12] on a bunch of hockey sticks here. And,
[78:14] uh, the 2030s are are when, you know,
[78:16] all this conversation becomes a bit
[78:17] mood. Yeah. Well, I and I want to be
[78:21] conscious of your time because there are
[78:22] certain topics that uh that it would be
[78:24] inappropriate of me to to dive into with
[78:27] little time left. Uh as I would want to
[78:29] make sure you have the the full time to
[78:31] get into them, but is it By the way, you
[78:35] still have uh another few minutes? Yeah.
[78:37] Yeah, I'm good. I'm good for another
[78:39] Yeah. 15 minutes. Okay. So, I mean,
[78:42] maybe we can we can get into one of them
[78:44] a little bit because we've I I I
[78:46] appreciate the context on uh kind of
[78:48] Bitcoin and somebody in the the noster
[78:50] chat uh soap miner pointed out that this
[78:53] is the kind of gold bitcoin back and
[78:55] forth as you know a a modern bimetalism
[78:57] almost that we might see. Uh so, I
[78:59] thought that that was an interesting way
[79:01] to uh frame it. I guess a a physical and
[79:04] uh and digital bimetalism. But I am uh I
[79:08] I would be I would be remiss if I didn't
[79:10] ask you a couple of questions. The first
[79:12] question is I just wanted to send the
[79:14] regards from the Vibes Capital
[79:16] Management team uh because they they did
[79:18] uh they did want to say hello. Um and
[79:20] I'm just curious of uh of you know if if
[79:23] your Vibes have have detected anything.
[79:25] Has there been any shift in your vibe
[79:27] towards Vive Cap Vibes Capital
[79:29] Management recently? And uh and yeah,
[79:31] what what is are you detecting a vibe
[79:33] shift?
[79:34] I mean, I think I mean, if I'm gonna be
[79:36] honest, and you know, I love Stephen,
[79:38] but uh you know, the vibes the you know,
[79:41] the Vibes, they've sold out. You know,
[79:42] they've they've they've completely
[79:44] they've been captured by the Bitcoin
[79:46] capital machine. You know, they're going
[79:48] around just sort of selling Bitcoin
[79:50] treasury companies to every equity
[79:52] market in the world with sort of trapped
[79:54] capital. And here I am, I'm just, you
[79:56] know, thus bake zerustra on my
[79:58] mountaintop, uh reading reading the
[80:00] willows. And um you know I I don't I
[80:03] don't post vibes. I make the vibes,
[80:05] right? I consciously steer you know the
[80:09] path of history just by just subtle
[80:11] winks and nods right you don't have to
[80:13] post about the vibes to make the vibes.
[80:14] The vibes are ineffable right you know
[80:16] Vickenstein you know said you know uh
[80:19] there of one cannot speak thereof one
[80:21] must be silent right sort of this sort
[80:23] of the ineffable esoteric domain in
[80:25] which we all operate. um if it can be
[80:28] named like the Dow that can be named is
[80:29] not the DAO, right? The vibe that can be
[80:31] named is not the vibe. So there's sort
[80:33] of sort of an inherent contradiction in
[80:35] Vib's capital management. Like what do
[80:36] you what are you managing, right? Like
[80:38] it's it's it's it's sanding in your
[80:40] fingers, right? Uh and so I just I uh I
[80:43] just I go I go with the wind and uh
[80:47] that's my vibe.
[80:49] That's going to be a a great sound bite
[80:51] that I'll have to clip out for uh for
[80:53] Stephen. I appreciate that. Um, so the
[80:56] other one and and I would be remiss if I
[80:58] didn't ask you about this too and you
[81:00] let me know what level of because again
[81:02] I know you know in 15 minutes that
[81:04] that's not uh enough time to do this
[81:06] justice but I I obviously uh you're
[81:10] mentioning things you know uh
[81:12] projections into the 2030s being or
[81:14] 2040s being somewhat moot and I assume
[81:16] that one of the things that you're
[81:17] referring there to is let's say uh
[81:20] hereto for uh clandestine knowledge uh
[81:23] coming to be widely publicly available
[81:27] and what sorts of radical changes that
[81:30] may force on the world. Is that what me
[81:33] beating around the bush there? Is that
[81:35] one of the things you're referring to
[81:37] there? Yeah, we have uh I don't know uh
[81:41] I don't know how much time, but uh
[81:43] there's a recognition coming about the
[81:45] position of humanity in the cosmos and
[81:47] the nature of human consciousness and
[81:49] the structure of reality that uh we're
[81:51] going to have to get smart smart on. um
[81:54] that may or may not be disruptive to
[81:55] certain metaphysical models of reality.
[81:57] Um certainly will be disruptive to our
[81:59] sense of what's possible technologically
[82:01] um and the parameter space in which
[82:03] humans may be able to operate as long as
[82:05] we don't kill each other or eliminate
[82:07] the you know prospects for future
[82:08] development. So we're kind of going
[82:10] through the crucible in the next 5 or 10
[82:11] years. Um and uh you know I don't
[82:15] exactly know the path dependency uh you
[82:18] know there but I'm pretty sure the end
[82:20] state is either we make it through and
[82:22] we have a much broader sense of
[82:23] ourselves and the possibility space for
[82:26] our civilization or we don't make it.
[82:28] Um, and that's, you know, it's kind of
[82:30] an analogy to how people talk about the
[82:32] AI conversation of this kind of
[82:34] singularity moment, the alignment
[82:35] problem. If we get super intelligence,
[82:37] it's either going to, you know, uplift
[82:39] all of us into, you know, some sort of
[82:41] transcendental nirvana, explore the
[82:44] future cone, imprint humans, uh, you
[82:47] know, uh, moral aspirations on the face
[82:50] of the cosmos. That's kind of the, you
[82:52] know, megalomania in San Francisco. I
[82:55] think that's a bit delusional. Um but
[82:57] it's gesturing at a sense of the
[83:00] hyperbolic bifurcation that's in our
[83:01] near future. Um we are we are on a we
[83:05] are on exponential a series of
[83:06] exponentials here. Um and then there's
[83:09] this sort of longunning current right so
[83:11] the UFO question right has been kind of
[83:14] draped in lore and social taboo and
[83:16] stigma. Um the US government is right
[83:19] now going through a series of agonizing
[83:21] internal tumult over how uh and to what
[83:26] degree to talk about it publicly and
[83:27] it's not just a US government question.
[83:28] It's a global question. It's a question
[83:30] that involves religious institutions and
[83:33] our financial system as well. So there's
[83:36] there's a lot that's baked into it.
[83:37] There's a lot of historical uh you know
[83:40] things that I think the powers that be
[83:42] would rather not talk about. Um, but
[83:43] there's a fundamental question here that
[83:45] we're going to have to own up to, which
[83:46] is the reality of non-human intelligence
[83:48] and advanced technology that's in our
[83:49] possession that we've been studying
[83:51] intensively, um, for many decades, may
[83:54] or may not have derived technology from,
[83:56] uh, that's shrouded from public view.
[83:58] And so, this is this is the the knot
[84:01] that's sort of tied up behind the
[84:03] scenes, and, you know, no one that
[84:04] touches that knot has figured out a way
[84:06] to untie it uh, in a in a clean way. Um,
[84:09] and so it just sits there as a very,
[84:11] very tight knot. um that only folks kind
[84:14] of that touch it know about. And so uh
[84:17] but but there are there's in there's
[84:19] institutionalization happening with this
[84:21] topic now. Uh if you're in certain
[84:23] circles talking about it with certain
[84:25] people, there's kind of a recognition
[84:27] just this is real. And uh there's sort
[84:30] of coded language that people, you know,
[84:32] in systems of official government,
[84:34] research institutions, um other other
[84:37] parts of the social graph use to talk
[84:39] about the subject as if it's a thing.
[84:41] and it is a thing. Um, and that's we
[84:43] have this sort of two layers of the
[84:45] conversation. We have the public
[84:46] conversation which is very much uh
[84:49] absolute epistemic uh black hole or just
[84:53] just nonsense. Like if you try to follow
[84:56] UAP Twitter or listen to most UAP
[84:58] podcasts, it's just you know the signal
[85:00] to noise ratio is not good. I'll just
[85:02] say that. Um and and so we have this
[85:05] very difficult environment where if
[85:08] you're curious and you're open-minded,
[85:10] which I think a lot of Bitcoiners are
[85:11] about, you know, what's really going on
[85:13] in the world or, you know, they want to
[85:15] think for themselves, they want to get
[85:16] to ground truth, they want to like
[85:18] actually, you know, assess for
[85:19] themselves the state of things. It's a
[85:21] very difficult subject to do that in
[85:23] because most of the things that you
[85:24] would, you know, go to are like fraught
[85:27] with all sorts of grift or propaganda
[85:31] or, you know, manipulation, outright
[85:33] fiction or schizophrenia. So, uh I don't
[85:37] I don't begrudge anyone who approaches
[85:38] the subject with inherent skepticism and
[85:41] um distance. Uh, I'll just say like, you
[85:45] know,
[85:47] you should try uh uh or or you know,
[85:50] it's like with Bitcoin, it's like you'll
[85:52] kind of get the truth at the price you
[85:53] deserve. Um, and uh it could be, you
[85:56] know, a few years down the line and it
[85:58] could come come as a bit of a a surprise
[86:00] or you could adapt yourself
[86:02] epistemically to a sense of of what's
[86:05] going on in in the world. I don't have I
[86:08] don't have full ground truth. I make no
[86:11] pretense to understand what's really
[86:12] happening or like what's the, you know,
[86:14] meta structure for for this whole topic,
[86:17] but I know enough to know that there's
[86:19] there's a there there uh and there's a
[86:22] there's a path we're on where more of
[86:24] that topic is going to become uh part of
[86:26] our public conversation, uh our
[86:28] political discourse, our policy
[86:30] decision-m at the national leadership
[86:32] level and across across the world. Um,
[86:35] it's just like with Bitcoin two, three
[86:37] years ago, like starting BPI, like with
[86:39] David and Grant, it was like this thesis
[86:41] that Bitcoin is going to be a serious
[86:42] and important thing and and it's not
[86:44] going to go away and it's going to be
[86:45] increasingly think it's going to land on
[86:46] the doorstep of these national leaders.
[86:48] is you need to build kind of this
[86:50] sensemaking apparatus, white papers and
[86:52] think tanks and fellows and serious
[86:54] discourse so that when the political
[86:57] system kind of wakes up to this thing
[86:58] that you know is real, there's like a
[87:01] prepared body of highly highly credible
[87:04] analysis and individuals that have
[87:05] professionalized the topic enough to
[87:07] kind of meet them at that moment. right
[87:09] now the UI topic that doesn't really
[87:11] exist. Um this it's very there's like
[87:13] some nent attempts to try to build
[87:15] something like that. But it's also I
[87:17] think a necessary feature just like with
[87:19] Bitcoin. And I think you kind of had to
[87:20] have this dynamic interplay between, you
[87:22] know, the non-government civil society
[87:24] think tanks, you know, scholars,
[87:27] professionalization of the topic had to
[87:29] kind of happen for the government as in
[87:31] as a set of institutions to kind of
[87:33] treat it seriously and then to kind of
[87:34] like reinforce each other to now the
[87:36] vice president talking about Bitcoin as
[87:38] a strategic asset and referencing a
[87:39] Bitcoin think tank, right? I think the
[87:41] same process is going to play out with
[87:43] UAPs. It's a bit of a like on a lag
[87:45] where parts of the government want this
[87:47] to become a part of the public
[87:48] conversation, but they can't really do
[87:50] that. that it's kind of a chicken and
[87:51] the egg problem because they can't
[87:52] actually, you know, reveal what they
[87:54] otherwise know until the civil society
[87:56] has professionalized the subject until
[87:58] it's moved from the taboo into the
[88:00] normal regime till the overton window
[88:02] is, you know, stretched enough and you
[88:04] have new institutions, new um, you know,
[88:08] uh, parts of the elite uh, political
[88:09] system and financial system, power
[88:12] structure
[88:14] that uh, are not part of the inner core
[88:16] but are kind of been socialized to the
[88:18] reality of this phenomenon. um that it
[88:20] kind of builds a bridge between the
[88:22] black world and the rest of society. And
[88:24] so you need to kind of have those things
[88:26] mature uh to have then the conversation
[88:29] go to another level. And I think we're
[88:30] in that we're like essentially UAPs are
[88:32] kind of where Bitcoin was maybe I don't
[88:34] know
[88:36] depends depends on my mood. Sometimes
[88:37] it's 2013 sometimes it's like 2017 2018
[88:41] right maybe optimistically like 2020 I
[88:43] don't know. Um, but there's definitely
[88:44] we're definitely not as close, right? In
[88:46] terms of the the the the normalization
[88:49] process. Um, but I think it's going to
[88:52] pick up, right? Just like with Bitcoin,
[88:54] it wasn't like an it wasn't like a
[88:55] linear process. It was like fringe dark
[88:57] web money, you know, a little bit of
[88:59] institutionalization, a little bit of
[89:01] like, you know, normalization, but still
[89:03] like 2020, 2021, you're talking about
[89:05] Bitcoin at Thanksgiving dinner, people,
[89:07] your your your aunt is looking at you
[89:08] like you're crosseyed. Like, what are
[89:10] you sure? like what's going on with
[89:12] Johnny, right? We're still at that stage
[89:14] with UAPs. If you talk about this
[89:16] subject in most most uh conversations,
[89:19] you still get like the bugeyed or kind
[89:21] of the squinty look. It's like, are you
[89:23] what's going on there? Um, and I'll just
[89:25] say like I maybe I specialized in like
[89:28] riding that part of the Overton window,
[89:30] right, as it kind of comes in. And I've
[89:32] kind of detected those little subtle
[89:34] shifts uh of when a thing is about to
[89:36] move, right? And there's alpha in that,
[89:39] right? Personal psychological alpha.
[89:41] they may actually be real alpha. I don't
[89:42] know. Um and uh I don't know like I have
[89:46] no predictions but uh it is it is uh I
[89:51] don't know it's it's funny it's like
[89:53] people ask me okay you're involved in
[89:55] both kind of the Bitcoin stuff and now
[89:56] you know increasingly so on the UAP side
[89:58] and like Bitcoin is a very serious thing
[90:00] and I think Bitcoin monetizing to parody
[90:02] with gold is a serious thing it's
[90:04] obviously the subject of my professional
[90:05] work but if I zoom out right over the
[90:07] next 5 10 years like what's the most
[90:10] important thing it's actually not not
[90:12] the Bitcoin stuff, it's this UAP stuff.
[90:14] Like this is the thing that's going to
[90:16] change the lives of my children much
[90:17] more so than Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin will
[90:19] give them a good life, but this thing
[90:21] will change the future of human
[90:23] civilization. Um, and that's a tough
[90:26] pill for a lot of people to swallow cuz
[90:27] that degree of radical change is not
[90:30] something we we like. And that's why the
[90:32] AI conversation is so, you know, uh,
[90:35] fraught because you have everyone that's
[90:37] an AI doomer or a singlearian or a
[90:41] skeptic and everyone forms these
[90:43] radicalized opinions on these like
[90:45] extreme exponential curves. Um, and when
[90:48] that's the nature of exponential is
[90:49] like, oh no, it's going to asmtote to
[90:51] here. Um, and so we have Bitcoin on this
[90:53] sort of hockey stick. We have AI on this
[90:55] hockey stick. And then coming shortly
[90:57] after that, we're going to have this
[90:58] other hockey stick of maybe more social
[91:01] recognition. So that's a bit of a, you
[91:03] know, like a meta conversation. It's a
[91:05] little bit too much get into the weeds
[91:07] of like why I believe that to be true or
[91:09] why the listener should believe anything
[91:11] like that is like a a plausible thing to
[91:13] pay attention to. I'm just saying it's
[91:15] how I've oriented myself and I've seen
[91:18] things that I can't unse
[91:22] Well, no, I I appreciate and one of
[91:24] these days we we do need to have a a
[91:26] singularly focused conversation on that
[91:28] that gives it the time it deserves. I
[91:30] mean, do you think that in terms of the
[91:31] larger disclosure, in terms of the uh
[91:34] the like government conversation and
[91:37] being willing to actually
[91:40] open some of this stuff up to the
[91:42] general public? Is some of that just
[91:44] going to be a function of the existing
[91:47] entrenched elite political class, you
[91:49] know, dying off and and retiring out?
[91:52] like is is some of that just like
[91:54] they've been involved or they've there's
[91:56] some that have known about this for so
[91:57] long that it's just like well you know I
[92:00] I don't want to oversee this the actual
[92:02] disclosure of because I know the the
[92:03] chaos it's going to cause and I just
[92:05] don't want that to be on my watch I want
[92:06] to go you know I want to go gently into
[92:08] the night basically
[92:11] yeah and there's a lot of things that
[92:12] are happening at the same time like an
[92:14] important one is the sort of
[92:15] generational cycle shift right we talked
[92:16] about institutions kind of decaying and
[92:19] you can imagine the apparatus of secrecy
[92:21] around this topic is such an institution
[92:23] that has decayed, right? And so it went
[92:25] from being a pretty hermetically sealed
[92:28] um government controlled uh set of
[92:30] programs in the 50s and 60s to being
[92:32] kind of privatized, right? Like all
[92:34] things were privatized in the 70s and '
[92:35] 80s, became hyper capitalistic and and
[92:38] even more privatized in the '90s and
[92:39] kind of went rogue to a certain extent.
[92:42] And then millennials started getting,
[92:44] you know, into some of those programs.
[92:45] And we are dogoodter millennials who are
[92:47] like taught from a young age when we see
[92:49] something wrong, we go tell the
[92:50] principal, right? And like this is not
[92:52] okay. And so now we've had a bunch of
[92:54] whistleblowers come out, right? David
[92:56] Grush and other folks that are not
[92:58] public are like these millennial
[93:00] dogooder whistleblowers who are like
[93:01] this is not cool guys. Like this this
[93:03] isn't a secret that we should keep from
[93:05] the American public or from the world
[93:06] and they're like this needs to come out.
[93:08] And so they started talking to uh to the
[93:11] senior senior staff on the Senate select
[93:13] committee intelligence and senior
[93:14] staffers and they started to you know
[93:15] hold these secret hearings and then
[93:17] started to pass laws in 2021 and 2022
[93:20] national defense authorization acts year
[93:22] after year and now we've gotten to the
[93:24] point where it's kind of this the
[93:25] institutional apparatus has kind of
[93:27] decayed and they've lost the ability to
[93:28] kind of hold hold the line and it's kind
[93:30] of fragmented and then the fragments you
[93:32] know in different parts of this very
[93:33] complicated system uh that are
[93:36] integrated with our security state and
[93:38] our research and development apparatus
[93:39] across you know you could you know
[93:41] different parts of the country that
[93:43] specialize in different things um uh
[93:45] take different different sides of this
[93:46] like disclosure question and so there's
[93:48] like this factional fight taking place
[93:50] like you know how much do we just want
[93:52] to new new power they want want to sort
[93:54] of co-opt that system for their own
[93:56] purposes right they don't want
[93:57] disclosure they just want they want they
[93:59] want they want to they want a piece of
[94:01] the action they want to get in on it
[94:02] they they want to displace the locked
[94:03] and the boeings and they want to have
[94:05] you know Palanteer and take over Okay,
[94:08] so that's that's one that's one line,
[94:10] right? I wouldn't call that a disclosure
[94:12] line. That's like just a you know, new
[94:14] boss, same as the old boss. And then
[94:16] there's the political faction, political
[94:18] tier, which wants to um you know, get
[94:20] control over these programs, which have
[94:22] not been under political control. Um and
[94:25] that's an accountability question, not a
[94:26] disclosure question. So that's like the
[94:28] gang of eight, Senator Rounds, Senator
[94:29] Schumer, Gillibrand, um Rubio before he
[94:33] went to become Secretary of State, uh
[94:35] Todd Young, um Martin Heinrich, these
[94:37] are the folks that have sponsored this
[94:39] disclosure act on UAPs that's going to
[94:40] be reintroduced by Senator RS this year.
[94:43] Um so there's a process being taking
[94:45] place. It's a political process for
[94:47] legislation to try to create a more
[94:50] formal system to inventory all the
[94:52] material and UAP records and then make
[94:55] uh a controlled disclosure campaign plan
[94:59] recommendation to the president from
[95:01] like a nine member panel of sort of
[95:04] eminence grass uh national security
[95:06] officials, economists, uh members of
[95:08] civil society, foreign foreign relations
[95:10] experts like this is this is written in
[95:12] law. You can read the UP disclosure act
[95:13] and see, you know, references to
[95:15] technologies of unknown origin and
[95:17] non-human intelligence and biological
[95:19] materials.
[95:21] This is the US Senate is telling you
[95:23] like this is what we're dealing with
[95:25] what we're all dealing with here. Um and
[95:27] so this is uh this is I think a not
[95:30] being it's like in the lump in the
[95:31] throat of the US government at the
[95:32] moment here because there's also a lot
[95:34] of manipulation taking place between
[95:36] different levels of the bureaucracy to
[95:38] try to gain advantage and to gain um uh
[95:43] protections for themselves. Right? If
[95:44] you've done illegal stuff uh you want to
[95:47] get you know immunity agreements. Um
[95:50] there's a massive you know longunning
[95:52] FBI investigation that's going on into
[95:54] this stuff. Um it's a small team but
[95:56] they've dug into it and uh yeah it's
[96:00] just it's it's playing out like on the
[96:02] political level and the bureaucratic
[96:04] level. Um and then but you know like I'm
[96:07] I'm a strategic adviser with this
[96:08] organization called Skywatcher which is
[96:11] staffed by some individuals that have
[96:12] have you know personal experience with
[96:14] these with these with this subject and
[96:16] this this phenomenon um you know as you
[96:18] know elements of the US government uh
[96:20] kind of security apparatus uh and you
[96:24] know it's
[96:25] it's based on the premise that the sky
[96:27] isn't classified
[96:28] uh and you can go out and you know
[96:30] collect information on the subject
[96:32] independent of the government. So you
[96:33] can advocate for the government to
[96:35] disclose this information, political
[96:37] process, activism, etc. And then there's
[96:39] just the public discovery part. Go out
[96:41] and collect data on anomalous objects,
[96:45] do that scientific analysis, bring that
[96:47] information to the public's awareness
[96:48] and move the conversation forward
[96:50] independent of government government
[96:51] disclosure efforts. And so I think both
[96:53] are happening and and potentially
[96:55] mutually reinforcing. Um but we're just
[96:57] starting that process. So remains to be
[97:00] seen, you know, um how far it will go.
[97:02] um how it might evolve. Um but uh but
[97:05] once once you hit it's kind of a it's
[97:07] like you're at this uh it's like
[97:09] activation threshold like a neuron
[97:11] doesn't fire until there's a certain
[97:13] density of you know calcium ions in the
[97:15] like in the synaptic cleft or whatever
[97:17] right um like you need to have that
[97:19] threshold reached and then and then boom
[97:22] it goes and so up until you reach that
[97:24] threshold you're looking at the system
[97:26] you're like not much is happening like
[97:27] this is probably not a real thing like I
[97:29] see a lot of sound and fury signifying
[97:31] nothing there's lots of scops it's
[97:33] probably a bunch of oids. It's cover for
[97:34] a stealth research program, F-47. Yeah,
[97:38] it kind of you can always tell a
[97:39] narrative to yourself up to a certain
[97:41] point that kind of dismisses the
[97:43] seriousness of the subject. Um, and we
[97:45] haven't reached that point where it's uh
[97:47] like the cascade is triggered, right?
[97:49] The preference falsification that
[97:51] everyone kind of has goes away. Um, but
[97:54] it's it's hard to predict when you reach
[97:56] that point, but like we are continually
[97:58] adding, you know, more neurotransmitters
[98:01] into the neuros into that cleft and
[98:03] we're reaching some point. I don't know
[98:04] what that threshold is where boom it
[98:07] goes. Uh, and it's sort of like with
[98:10] Bitcoin. It's like gradually then
[98:11] suddenly it's like and it's kind of
[98:13] there's a matter of contingency here.
[98:16] Larry Frink getting orange pill and
[98:18] certain dinners happening with certain
[98:19] political operatives and then Trump
[98:21] deciding this is a thing he's going to
[98:22] support and then like the dominoes fall
[98:25] right and it was like that was a highly
[98:26] nonlinear and non-deterministic process
[98:29] highly contingent like certain things
[98:30] had to happen in the right way and they
[98:32] had to be amplified and not you know
[98:34] smothered and then the world had to kind
[98:36] of evolve in that branch right um and
[98:40] we're kind of I see where things are
[98:43] happening that direction I mean think
[98:45] I'm optimistic over the medium-term.
[98:48] Tactically, I think this administration
[98:50] is not ready to talk about this publicly
[98:52] right now. Um, I just don't see it.
[98:55] There's a lot of churn at the national
[98:56] security level. Um, I know that a lot of
[98:59] the national leadership know about the
[99:00] subject. Um, you know, folks in charge
[99:03] of these intelligence and defense and
[99:04] security agencies. This is not like like
[99:08] this is a thing. This isn't like a oh
[99:10] like they're aware of this. It's just a
[99:13] is this a tomorrow problem? And there's
[99:15] a collective responsibility issue. It's
[99:17] like all right, every one of those
[99:18] officials wants to be briefed on this
[99:19] subject, but they don't want to own it.
[99:22] So, you're in this situation where like
[99:25] there's this bizarre, you know, am um uh
[99:29] kind of tension in in the air where
[99:31] everyone knows that everyone else knows,
[99:33] but nobody wants to own the hot potato
[99:35] here cuz then it's like you own it and
[99:38] that's
[99:40] is I don't I I I I have some sympathy
[99:42] for these officials because it's like
[99:44] it's not clear what the upside is for
[99:45] them. A lot of other things to deal
[99:46] with. This is not like a political
[99:48] winner in many ways. Um, and it's not
[99:51] clearly that in their portfolio. It's
[99:54] like this topic stretches across much
[99:56] more than any sort of domain you have in
[99:59] a security responsibility or e economic
[100:01] responsibility. Like it's a it's not
[100:04] even a government responsibility. It's
[100:05] like a it's it's all it's
[100:07] all-encompassing. We don't have we don't
[100:09] have a UAP department. Uh, and so this
[100:12] is what they're trying to get to with
[100:14] this UAP disclosure act is something
[100:15] like a formal institutional mechanism to
[100:19] handle the accountability question, take
[100:22] possession of these materials, and then
[100:24] handle the disclosure question in a in a
[100:27] in a in a more democratic fashion that's
[100:29] like accountable to the government and
[100:30] to the public. We'll see. I mean, I
[100:33] don't know what the prospects for the UP
[100:35] disclosure act are. Um, you know, the
[100:37] opposition that was there inside the
[100:38] inside the house is gone, some of it at
[100:42] least. But
[100:45] I it'd be interesting to see how the
[100:46] like where where the White House stands.
[100:47] Um, Senator Rounds is a champion on this
[100:50] issue. He's shown a lot of courage. I I
[100:52] I applaud him. Um, folks should, you
[100:55] know, just Google Senator Rounds UAPs
[100:57] and see what he said. Um, I've I've
[101:00] heard private remarks by him and he's he
[101:02] knows what's going on. Um, and he's just
[101:04] one senator, though. Um, but he's he's
[101:07] not stop he's not going to stop talking
[101:09] about this stuff and he's got a bill
[101:10] that he's going to push for it. So, it's
[101:12] like with Bitcoiners, it's like, you
[101:14] know, folks that care to engage
[101:16] politically can. Same thing with UAPs.
[101:18] Like, if you care, you can engage. You
[101:19] can talk to your congressman and be
[101:20] like, I think you should support this
[101:21] bill. Um, there's a, you know, there's
[101:25] other things going on. But uh yeah, I
[101:27] mean it's a it's a subject I think is is
[101:31] is the most important subject that
[101:33] exists and uh but we've been conditioned
[101:35] with taboo and uh stigma so that we
[101:38] don't really we don't really like to
[101:40] talk about it but it's there. Yeah. Oh,
[101:43] yeah. We're definitely going to need uh
[101:45] at at some once uh once the the
[101:47] conference circuit dies down, we'll
[101:49] we'll we'll we'll take some time maybe
[101:50] because I I do think it's you know,
[101:53] maybe it's hard for some uh Bitcoiners
[101:55] to hear that there is something more
[101:56] important out there than Bitcoin. Uh
[101:58] but, you know, rest assured, I think, uh
[102:02] Bitcoin is uh probably the one of the
[102:05] only monies that's going to hold up in
[102:06] the world that is to come uh after some
[102:09] of these seismic shifts. And so, yeah,
[102:12] I'm I'm interested to see uh I'm
[102:15] interested to see what the White House
[102:16] does have to say on this and if they
[102:17] decide to push it. Like you said,
[102:18] there's a lot of other stuff going on.
[102:20] Maybe they don't want to touch it, but
[102:21] let's see what happens. But I've kept
[102:23] you uh I've kept you a little long,
[102:25] Matt, and I appreciate your time here.
