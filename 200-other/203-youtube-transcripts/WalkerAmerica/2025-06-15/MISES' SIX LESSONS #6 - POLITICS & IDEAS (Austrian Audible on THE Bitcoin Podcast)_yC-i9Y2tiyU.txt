[00:00] What had taken place? What was the
[00:03] problem? What was it that caused the
[00:06] disintegration of an empire which in
[00:09] every regard had attained the highest
[00:12] civilization ever achieved before the
[00:14] 18th century? The truth is that what
[00:18] destroyed this ancient civilization was
[00:21] something similar almost identical to
[00:24] the dangers that threaten our
[00:25] civilization today. On the one hand, it
[00:29] was interventionism and on the other
[00:31] hand,
[00:35] [Music]
[00:40] inflation. Greetings and salutations, my
[00:43] fellow plebs. My name is Walker and this
[00:45] is the Bitcoin podcast. The Bitcoin time
[00:48] chain is
[00:49] 890443 and the value of one Bitcoin is
[00:52] still one bitcoin. Today's episode is
[00:56] Austrian Audible and I'll be reading the
[00:58] sixth and final installment of Mis's six
[01:01] lessons. I know this has been a long
[01:03] time in coming, so thank you for your
[01:05] patience. I just finished recording the
[01:07] audio book of The Big Print by Lawrence
[01:10] Leard and thought I'd keep the narration
[01:12] momentum going by finally finishing up
[01:15] this final lecture from Mises. If this
[01:18] is your first time listening to Austrian
[01:20] Audible on the Bitcoin podcast, consider
[01:23] going back and checking out the other
[01:25] episodes on capitalism, socialism,
[01:27] interventionism, inflation, and foreign
[01:30] investment and listening to those first
[01:32] in order. Or don't. Bitcoin doesn't
[01:35] care. You can find the links to the
[01:37] Austrian Audible playlist in the show
[01:39] notes. Please share these Austrian
[01:41] Audible lessons with your friends,
[01:43] family, and strangers on the internet
[01:45] who can benefit from the knowledge of
[01:47] real economics as taught by Mises and
[01:49] the Austrian school. Without further
[01:52] ado, let's get into lesson six from
[01:54] Mises's six lessons, policies and ideas.
[01:59] [Music]
[02:06] Sixth lecture, politics and
[02:10] ideas. In the age of enlightenment, in
[02:13] the years in which the North Americans
[02:15] founded their independence and a few
[02:18] years later when the Spanish and
[02:20] Portuguese colonies were transformed
[02:22] into independent nations. The prevailing
[02:25] mood in Western civilization was
[02:28] optimistic. At that time all
[02:30] philosophers and statesmen were fully
[02:33] convinced that we were living at the
[02:35] beginning of a new age of prosperity,
[02:38] progress and freedom. In those days,
[02:42] people expected that the new political
[02:44] institutions, the constitutional
[02:47] representative governments established
[02:49] in the free nations of Europe and
[02:51] America, would work in a very beneficial
[02:54] way and that economic freedom would
[02:57] continuously improve the material
[02:59] conditions of mankind. We know very well
[03:03] that some of these expectations were too
[03:06] optimistic. It is certainly true that we
[03:09] have experienced in the 19th and 20th
[03:12] centuries an unprecedented improvement
[03:16] in economic conditions making it
[03:18] possible for a much larger population to
[03:21] live at a much higher standard of
[03:24] living. But we also know that many of
[03:27] the hopes of the 18th century
[03:29] philosophers have been badly shattered.
[03:32] hopes that there would not be any more
[03:34] wars and that revolutions would become
[03:38] unnecessary. These expectations were not
[03:41] realized. During the 19th century, there
[03:45] was a period when wars decreased in both
[03:48] number and severity. But the 20th
[03:51] century brought a resurgence of the
[03:53] warlike spirit. And we can fairly well
[03:56] say that we may not yet be at the end of
[03:59] the trials through which mankind will
[04:02] have to go. The constitutional system
[04:04] that began at the end of the 18th and
[04:07] the beginning of the 19th century has
[04:10] disappointed mankind. Most people also
[04:14] most authors who have dealt with this
[04:16] problem seem to think there has been no
[04:19] connection between the economic and the
[04:22] political side of the problem. Thus they
[04:25] tend to deal at great length with the
[04:27] decay of
[04:29] parliamentarianism governed by the
[04:31] representatives of the people as if this
[04:34] phenomenon were completely independent
[04:36] of the economic situation and of the
[04:39] economic ideas that determine the
[04:42] activities of people. But such an
[04:45] independence does not exist. Man is not
[04:49] a being that on the one hand has an
[04:52] economic side and on the other hand a
[04:55] political side with no connection
[04:58] between the two. In fact, what is called
[05:01] the decay of freedom of constitutional
[05:04] government and representative
[05:06] institutions is the consequence of the
[05:09] radical change in economic and political
[05:12] ideas. The political events are the
[05:15] inevitable consequence of the change in
[05:18] economic policies. The ideas that guided
[05:22] the statesmen, philosophers, and lawyers
[05:25] who in the 18th century and in the early
[05:28] 19th century developed the fundamentals
[05:31] of the new political system started from
[05:33] the assumption that within a nation all
[05:37] honest citizens have the same ultimate
[05:39] goal. This ultimate goal to which all
[05:43] decent men should be dedicated is the
[05:46] welfare of the whole nation and also the
[05:49] welfare of other nations. These moral
[05:52] and political leaders being fully
[05:55] convinced that a free nation is not
[05:58] interested in conquest. They conceived
[06:01] of party strife as only natural, that it
[06:04] was perfectly normal for there to be
[06:06] differences of opinion concerning the
[06:08] best way to conduct the affairs of the
[06:11] state. Those people who held similar
[06:13] ideas about a problem cooperated and
[06:16] this cooperation was called a party. But
[06:19] a party structure was not permanent. It
[06:22] did not depend on the position of the
[06:25] individuals within the whole social
[06:27] structure. It could change if people
[06:29] learned that their original position was
[06:32] based on erroneous assumptions or
[06:34] erroneous ideas. From this point of
[06:37] view, many regarded the discussions in
[06:40] the election campaigns and later in the
[06:42] legislative assemblies as an important
[06:45] political factor. The speeches of
[06:47] members of a legislature were not
[06:49] considered to be merely pronouncements
[06:52] telling the world what a political party
[06:54] wanted. They were regarded as attempts
[06:57] to convince opposing groups that the
[06:59] speaker's own ideas were more correct,
[07:03] more beneficial to the common wheel than
[07:06] those which they had heard before.
[07:08] Political speeches, editorials in
[07:11] newspapers, pamphlets, and books were
[07:13] written in order to persuade. There was
[07:16] little reason to believe that one could
[07:18] not convince the majority that one's own
[07:21] position was absolutely correct if one's
[07:25] ideas were sound. It was from this point
[07:28] of view that the constitutional rules
[07:30] were written in the legislative bodies
[07:32] of the early 19th century. But this
[07:35] implied that the government would not
[07:38] interfere with the economic conditions
[07:40] of the market. It implied that all
[07:43] citizens had only one political aim, the
[07:47] welfare of the whole country and of the
[07:50] whole nation. And it is precisely this
[07:53] social and economic philosophy that
[07:55] interventionism has replaced.
[07:57] Interventionism has spawned a very
[08:00] different philosophy. Under
[08:02] interventionist ideas, it is the duty of
[08:05] the government to support, to subsidize,
[08:08] to give privileges to special groups.
[08:11] The idea of the 18th century statesmen
[08:14] was that the legislators had special
[08:16] ideas about the common good. But what we
[08:20] have today, what we see today in the
[08:23] reality of political life practically
[08:26] without any exceptions in all the
[08:29] countries of the world where there is
[08:31] not simply communist dictatorship is a
[08:34] situation where there are no longer real
[08:37] political parties in the old classical
[08:39] sense but merely pressure groups. A
[08:43] pressure group is a group of people who
[08:45] want to attain for themselves a special
[08:48] privilege at the expense of the rest of
[08:50] the nation. This privilege may consist
[08:53] in a tariff on competing imports. It may
[08:56] consist in a subsidy. It may consist in
[08:59] laws that prevent other people from
[09:01] competing with the members of the
[09:03] pressure group. At any rate, it gives
[09:06] the members of the pressure group a
[09:08] special position. It gives them
[09:11] something which is denied or ought to be
[09:13] denied according to the ideas of the
[09:16] pressure group to other groups. In the
[09:19] United States, the two-party system of
[09:22] the old days is seemingly still
[09:24] preserved. But this is only a camouflage
[09:27] of the real situation. In fact, the
[09:31] political life of the United States as
[09:34] well as the political life of all other
[09:36] countries is determined by the struggle
[09:39] and aspirations of pressure groups. In
[09:43] the United States, there is still a
[09:45] Republican party and a Democratic party.
[09:48] But in each of these parties, there are
[09:50] pressure group representatives.
[09:53] These pressure group representatives are
[09:55] more interested in cooperation with
[09:58] representatives of the same pressure
[10:00] group in the opposing party than with
[10:03] the efforts of fellow members in their
[10:05] own party. To give you an example, if
[10:08] you talk to people in the United States
[10:11] who really know the business of
[10:12] Congress, they will tell you this man,
[10:16] this member of Congress represents the
[10:18] interests of the silver groups. or they
[10:21] will tell you another man represents the
[10:23] wheat growers. Of course, each of these
[10:26] pressure groups is necessarily a
[10:28] minority. In a system based on the
[10:31] division of labor, every special group
[10:33] that aims at privileges has to be a
[10:36] minority. And minorities never have the
[10:39] chance to attain success if they do not
[10:42] cooperate with other similar minorities,
[10:45] similar pressure groups. In the
[10:47] legislative assemblies, they try to
[10:50] bring about a coalition between various
[10:52] pressure groups so that they might
[10:54] become the majority. But after a time,
[10:58] this coalition may disintegrate because
[11:01] there are problems on which it is
[11:03] impossible to reach agreement with other
[11:05] pressure groups and new pressure group
[11:08] coalitions are formed. This is what
[11:11] happened in France in
[11:13] 1871. a situation which historians
[11:16] deemed the decay of the third republic.
[11:20] It was not a decay of the third
[11:22] republic. It was simply an
[11:24] exemplification of the fact that the
[11:26] pressure group system is not a system
[11:29] that can be successfully applied to the
[11:31] government of a big nation. You have in
[11:34] the legislatures representatives of
[11:36] wheat, of meat, of silver, and of oil.
[11:40] But first of all of the various unions
[11:43] only one thing is not represented in the
[11:47] legislature. The nation as a whole.
[11:50] There are only a few who take the side
[11:53] of the nation as a whole and all
[11:56] problems even those of foreign policy
[11:59] are seen from the point of view of the
[12:01] special pressure group interests. In the
[12:04] United States, some of the less
[12:06] populated states are interested in the
[12:09] price of silver, but not everybody in
[12:12] these states is interested in it.
[12:15] Nevertheless, the United States for many
[12:17] decades has spent a considerable sum of
[12:21] money at the expense of the taxpayers in
[12:24] order to buy silver above its market
[12:27] price. For another example, in the
[12:30] United States, only a small proportion
[12:32] of the population is employed in
[12:35] agriculture. The remainder of the
[12:37] population is made up of consumers, but
[12:40] not producers of agricultural products.
[12:43] The United States, nevertheless, has a
[12:46] policy of spending billions and billions
[12:49] in order to keep the prices of
[12:51] agricultural products above the
[12:53] potential market price. One cannot say
[12:57] that this is a policy in favor of a
[12:59] small minority because these
[13:01] agricultural interests are not uniform.
[13:04] The dairy farmer is not interested in a
[13:07] high price for cereals. On the contrary,
[13:10] he would prefer a lower price for this
[13:13] product. A chicken farmer wants a lower
[13:16] price for chicken feed. There are many
[13:19] incompatible special interests within
[13:21] this group. And yet, clever diplomacy in
[13:25] congressional politics makes it possible
[13:28] for small minority groups to get
[13:30] privileges at the expense of the
[13:33] majority. If you're stuck spending

[16:48] thank you. One situation especially
[16:51] interesting in the United States
[16:54] concerns sugar. Perhaps only about one
[16:58] out of 500 Americans is interested in a
[17:01] higher price for sugar. Probably 499 out
[17:06] of 500 want a lower price for sugar.
[17:09] Nevertheless, the policy of the United
[17:11] States is committed by tariffs and other
[17:14] special measures to a higher price for
[17:18] sugar. This policy is not only
[17:20] detrimental to the interests of those
[17:23] 499 who are consumers of sugar, it also
[17:27] creates a very severe problem of foreign
[17:29] policy for the United States. The aim of
[17:32] foreign policy is cooperation with all
[17:35] other American republics, some of which
[17:38] are interested in selling sugar to the
[17:40] United States. They would like to sell a
[17:43] greater quantity of it. This illustrates
[17:46] how pressure group interests may
[17:48] determine even the foreign policy of a
[17:51] nation. For years, people throughout the
[17:54] world have been writing about democracy,
[17:56] about popular representative government.
[18:00] They have been complaining about its
[18:02] inadequacies. But the democracy they
[18:05] criticize is only that democracy under
[18:08] which interventionism is the governing
[18:11] policy of the country. Today one might
[18:14] hear people say in the early 19th
[18:17] century in the legislatures of France,
[18:20] England and the United States and other
[18:22] nations there were speeches about the
[18:25] great problems of mankind. They fought
[18:27] against tyranny for freedom for
[18:30] cooperation with all other free nations.
[18:33] But now we are more practical in the
[18:36] legislature. Of course, we are more
[18:39] practical. People today do not talk
[18:42] about freedom. They talk about a higher
[18:45] price for peanuts. If this is practical,
[18:48] then of course the legislatures have
[18:50] changed considerably, but not improved.
[18:54] These political changes brought about by
[18:58] interventionism have considerably
[19:00] weakened the power of nations and of
[19:02] representatives to resist the
[19:04] aspirations of dictators and the
[19:07] operations of tyrants. The legislative
[19:10] representatives whose only concern is to
[19:13] satisfy the voters who want for instance
[19:16] a high price for sugar, milk and butter
[19:20] and a low price for wheat subsidized by
[19:23] the government can represent the people
[19:26] only in a very weak way. They can never
[19:29] represent all their constituents. The
[19:32] voters who are in favor of such
[19:35] privileges do not realize that there are
[19:38] also opponents who want the opposite
[19:40] thing and who prevent their
[19:42] representatives from achieving full
[19:45] success. This system leads also to a
[19:48] constant increase of the public
[19:50] expenditures on the one hand and makes
[19:53] it more difficult on the other to levy
[19:55] taxes. These pressure group
[19:58] representatives want many special
[20:00] privileges for their pressure groups,
[20:02] but they do not want to burden their
[20:04] supporters with a too heavy tax load. It
[20:08] was not the idea of the 18th century
[20:10] founders of modern constitutional
[20:12] government that a legislator should
[20:15] represent not the whole nation but only
[20:18] the special interests of the district in
[20:20] which he was elected. That was one of
[20:23] the consequences of interventionism. The
[20:26] original idea was that every member of
[20:29] the legislature should represent the
[20:31] whole nation. He was elected in a
[20:34] special district only because there he
[20:36] was known and elected by people who had
[20:39] confidence in him. But it was not
[20:41] intended that he go into government in
[20:44] order to procure something special for
[20:46] his constituency. That he ask for a new
[20:50] school or a new hospital or a new
[20:52] lunatic asylum, thereby causing a
[20:55] considerable rise in government
[20:57] expenditures within his district.
[21:00] Pressure group politics explains why it
[21:02] is almost impossible for all governments
[21:05] to stop inflation. As soon as the
[21:08] elected officials try to restrict
[21:10] expenditures to limit spending, those
[21:13] who support special interests, who
[21:16] derive advantages from special items in
[21:19] the budget, come and declare that this
[21:22] particular project cannot be undertaken
[21:25] or that that one must be done.
[21:28] Dictatorship of course is no solution to
[21:31] the problems of economics just as it is
[21:34] not the answer to the problems of
[21:36] freedom. A dictator may start out by
[21:40] making promises of every sort but being
[21:43] a dictator he will not keep his
[21:46] promises. He will instead suppress free
[21:50] speech immediately so that the
[21:52] newspapers and the legislative speech
[21:54] makers will not be able to point out
[21:57] days, months or years afterwards that he
[22:01] said something different on the first
[22:03] day of his dictatorship than he did
[22:06] later on. The terrible dictatorship
[22:09] which such a big country as Germany had
[22:12] to live through in the recent past comes
[22:14] to mind as we look upon the decline of
[22:17] freedom in so many countries today. As a
[22:20] result, people speak now about the decay
[22:23] of freedom and about the decline of our
[22:27] civilization. People say that every
[22:30] civilization must finally fall into ruin
[22:33] and disintegrate. There are eminent
[22:36] supporters of this idea. One was a
[22:39] German teacher Spangler and another one
[22:42] much better known was the English
[22:44] historian Toinbe. They tell us that our
[22:48] civilization is now old. Spangler
[22:51] compared civilizations to plants which
[22:54] grow and grow but whose life finally
[22:57] comes to an end. The same, he says, is
[23:00] true for civilizations.
[23:03] The metaphorical likening of a
[23:05] civilization to a plant is completely
[23:08] arbitrary. First of all, it is within
[23:11] the history of mankind very difficult to
[23:14] distinguish between different
[23:15] independent
[23:17] civilizations. Civilizations are not
[23:20] independent. They are
[23:22] interdependent. They constantly
[23:24] influence each other. One cannot speak
[23:27] of the decline of a particular
[23:29] civilization. Therefore, in the same way
[23:32] that one can speak of the death of a
[23:35] particular plant, but even if you refute
[23:38] the doctrines of Spangler and tobby, a
[23:42] very popular comparison still remains.
[23:45] The comparison of decaying
[23:47] civilizations. It is certainly true that
[23:50] in the 2n century AD the Roman Empire
[23:54] nurtured a very flourishing
[23:57] civilization that in those parts of
[23:59] Europe, Asia and Africa in which the
[24:02] Roman Empire ruled there was a very high
[24:06] civilization. There was also a very high
[24:09] economic
[24:11] civilization based on a certain degree
[24:13] of division of labor. Although it
[24:16] appears quite primitive when compared
[24:18] with our conditions today, it certainly
[24:21] was remarkable. It reached the highest
[24:24] degree of the division of labor ever
[24:26] attained before modern capitalism. It is
[24:30] no less true that this civilization
[24:33] disintegrated, especially in the 3rd
[24:35] century. This disintegration within the
[24:38] Roman Empire made it impossible for the
[24:41] Romans to resist aggression from
[24:43] without. Although the aggression was no
[24:46] worse than that which the Romans had
[24:48] resisted again and again in the
[24:50] preceding centuries, they could
[24:52] withstand it no longer after what had
[24:55] taken place within the Roman Empire.
[24:58] What had taken place? What was the
[25:01] problem? What was it that caused the
[25:04] disintegration of an empire which in
[25:07] every regard had attained the highest
[25:10] civilization ever achieved before the
[25:13] 18th century? The truth is that what
[25:16] destroyed this ancient civilization was
[25:19] something similar almost identical to
[25:22] the dangers that threaten our
[25:24] civilization today. On the one hand it
[25:27] was interventionism and on the other
[25:30] hand inflation. The interventionism of
[25:33] the Roman Empire consisted in the fact
[25:36] that the Roman Empire following the
[25:39] preceding Greek policy did not abstain
[25:42] from price control. This price control
[25:45] was mild, practically without any
[25:49] consequences because for centuries it
[25:51] did not try to reduce prices below the
[25:54] market level. But when inflation began
[25:57] in the 3rd century, the poor Romans did
[26:00] not yet have our technical means for
[26:03] inflation. They could not print money.
[26:06] They had to debase the coinage. And this
[26:09] was a much inferior system of inflation
[26:12] compared to the present system which
[26:15] through the use of the modern printing
[26:17] press can so easily destroy the value of
[26:21] money. But it was efficient enough and
[26:24] it brought about the same result as
[26:27] price control. For the prices which the
[26:29] authorities tolerated were now below the
[26:33] potential price to which inflation had
[26:35] brought the prices of the various
[26:37] commodities. The result of course was
[26:41] that the supply of food stuffs in the
[26:43] cities declined. The people in the
[26:46] cities were forced to go back to the
[26:48] country and to return to agricultural
[26:51] life. The Romans never realized what was
[26:54] happening. They did not understand it.
[26:58] They had not developed the mental tools
[27:00] to interpret the problems of the
[27:02] division of labor and the consequences
[27:05] of inflation upon market prices. that
[27:08] this currency inflation, currency
[27:11] debasement was bad. This they knew of
[27:14] course very well. Consequently, the
[27:17] emperors made laws against this
[27:19] movement. There were laws preventing the
[27:22] city dweller from moving to the country.
[27:24] But such laws were ineffective as the
[27:27] people did not have anything to eat in
[27:29] the city as they were starving. No law
[27:32] could keep them from leaving the city
[27:34] and going back into agriculture. The
[27:37] city dweller could no longer work in the
[27:39] processing industries of the cities as
[27:42] an artisan and with the loss of the
[27:44] markets in the cities, no one could buy
[27:47] anything there anymore. Thus, we see
[27:50] that from the 3rd century on the cities
[27:53] of the Roman Empire were declining and
[27:56] that the division of labor became less
[27:58] intensive than it had been before.
[28:01] Finally, the medieval system of the
[28:04] self-sufficient household of the villa
[28:06] as it was called in later laws emerged.
[28:10] Therefore, if people compare our
[28:13] conditions with those of the Roman
[28:14] Empire and say we will go the same way,
[28:19] they have some reasons for saying so.
[28:22] They can find some facts which are
[28:24] similar, but there are also enormous
[28:27] differences. These differences are not
[28:30] in the political structure which
[28:32] prevailed in the second part of the 3rd
[28:34] century. Then on the average of every 3
[28:38] years an emperor was assassinated and
[28:41] the man who killed him or had caused his
[28:44] death became his successor. After 3
[28:48] years on the average the same happened
[28:50] to the new emperor. When Diolesian in
[28:53] the year 284 became emperor, he tried
[28:57] for some time to oppose the decay but
[29:01] without success. There are enormous
[29:04] differences between present-day
[29:06] conditions and those that prevailed in
[29:08] Rome in that the measures that caused
[29:11] the disintegration of the Roman Empire
[29:13] were not premeditated. They were not, I
[29:17] would say, the result of reprehensible
[29:20] formalized doctrines. In contrast,
[29:23] however, the interventionist ideas, the
[29:27] socialist ideas, the inflationist ideas
[29:31] of our time have been concocted and
[29:34] formalized by writers and professors,
[29:38] and they are taught at colleges and
[29:40] universities. You may say today's
[29:44] situation is much worse. I will answer
[29:48] no it is not worse. It is better in my
[29:52] opinion because ideas can be defeated by
[29:55] other ideas. Nobody doubted in the age
[29:59] of the Roman emperors that the
[30:01] government had the right and that it was
[30:04] a good policy to determine maximum
[30:07] prices. Nobody disputed this. But now
[30:11] that we have schools and professors and
[30:14] books that recommend this, we know very
[30:17] well that this is a problem for
[30:19] discussion. All these bad ideas from
[30:22] which we suffer today which have made
[30:25] our policies so harmful were developed
[30:29] by academic theorists. A famous Spanish
[30:32] author spoke about the revolt of the
[30:35] masses. We have to be very cautious in
[30:38] using this term because this revolt was
[30:42] not made by the masses. It was made by
[30:45] the
[30:46] intellectuals. And those intellectuals
[30:48] who developed these doctrines were not
[30:51] men from the masses. The marxian
[30:54] doctrine pretends that it is only the
[30:57] proletarians that have the good ideas
[31:00] and that only the proletarian mind
[31:03] created socialism.
[31:05] But all the socialist authors without
[31:08] exception were bourgeois in the sense in
[31:12] which the socialists use the term Karl
[31:15] Marx was not a man from the proletariat.
[31:18] He was the son of a lawyer. He did not
[31:21] have to work to go to the university. He
[31:24] studied at the university in the same
[31:27] way as do the sons of wellto-do people
[31:30] today. Later and for the rest of his
[31:33] life, he was supported by his friend
[31:36] Friedrich Engles who being a
[31:39] manufacturer was the worst type of
[31:41] bourgeoa according to socialist ideas.
[31:45] In the language of Marxism, he was an
[31:48] exploer. Everything that happens in the
[31:51] social world in our time is the result
[31:54] of ideas, good things and bad things.
[31:59] What is needed is to fight bad ideas. We
[32:03] must fight all that we dislike in public
[32:06] life. We must substitute better ideas
[32:10] for wrong ideas. We must refute the
[32:13] doctrines that promote union violence.
[32:17] We must oppose the confiscation of
[32:19] property, the control of prices,
[32:22] inflation, and all those evils from
[32:25] which we suffer. ideas and only ideas
[32:29] can light the darkness. These ideas must
[32:32] be brought to the public in such a way
[32:34] that they persuade people. We must
[32:37] convince them that these ideas are the
[32:40] right ideas and not the wrong ones. The
[32:43] great age of the 19th century, the great
[32:46] achievements of capitalism were the
[32:49] result of the ideas of the classical
[32:52] economists, of Adam Smith and David
[32:55] Ricardo, of Bastia and others. What we
[32:59] need is nothing else than to substitute
[33:02] better ideas for bad ideas. This, I
[33:06] hope, and am confident will be done by
[33:09] the rising generation. Our civilization
[33:12] is not doomed as Spangler and Toinby
[33:15] tell us. Our civilization will not be
[33:19] conquered by the spirit of Moscow. Our
[33:22] civilization will and must survive. And
[33:25] it will survive through better ideas
[33:28] than those which now govern most of the
[33:30] world today. And these better ideas will
[33:34] be developed by the rising generation. I
[33:37] consider it as a very good sign that
[33:40] while 50 years ago practically no one in
[33:43] the world had the courage to say
[33:45] anything in favor of a free economy, we
[33:48] now have at least in some of the
[33:50] advanced countries of the world.
[33:52] institutions that are centers for the
[33:55] propagation of a free economy such as
[33:58] for example the centro in your country
[34:02] which invited me to come to Buenos Cyrus
[34:05] to say a few words in this great city. I
[34:09] could not say much about these important
[34:11] matters. Six lectures may be very much
[34:14] for an audience, but they are not enough
[34:17] to develop the whole philosophy of a
[34:19] free economic system and certainly not
[34:22] enough to refute all the nonsense that
[34:25] has been written in the last 50 years
[34:27] about the economic problems with which
[34:29] we are dealing. I am very grateful to
[34:32] this center for giving me the
[34:34] opportunity to address such a
[34:36] distinguished audience and I hope that
[34:39] in a few years the number of those who
[34:42] are supporting ideas for freedom in this
[34:45] country and in other countries will
[34:49] increase considerably. I myself have
[34:52] full confidence in the future of freedom
[34:55] both political and economic.
