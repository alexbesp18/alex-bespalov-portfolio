[00:00] Basically the breakthrough was that
[00:01] Bitcoin is a vibe. And prior to
[00:04] understanding that Bitcoin is a vibe, uh
[00:06] some of these asset managers were trying
[00:10] to fit Bitcoin into an existing
[00:14] investment model, free cash flows,
[00:16] certain government models, all of these
[00:18] things. They're trying to put Bitcoin
[00:20] into a spreadsheet, into a formula, into
[00:24] a way of thinking about these things.
[00:26] And there really was no way to value
[00:27] Bitcoin. People have talked about this
[00:29] forever. It's realizing and it and it
[00:32] was this capital allocator realizing you
[00:34] can't do that. Bitcoin doesn't fit into
[00:37] that. Bitcoin is a vibe and it's one of
[00:40] the best vibes in the world and you can
[00:42] chart its success as a vibe over the
[00:45] last over a decade. And once you realize
[00:48] that that's what it is and that Bitcoin
[00:51] investing is vibes investing, then this
[00:54] all starts to make sense.
[01:02] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:04] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:06] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:10] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:12] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:15] Bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:17] right now, remember you are still early.

[01:49] Without further ado, let's get into this
[01:51] Bitcoin talk.
[01:59] I realized that perhaps the Austrian
[02:02] economic idea of human action and
[02:06] subjective value is actually just
[02:08] vibes-based investment and vibe
[02:10] economics. And I think they're actually
[02:13] one and the same. Like Mises was
[02:15] actually just talking about vibes this
[02:18] whole time, you guys. And I don't know,
[02:21] maybe maybe I'm I'm too deep down the
[02:23] vibe rabbit hole, but I'm pretty sure
[02:25] that human action is just vibes. Like
[02:28] you're looking for a vibes.
[02:31] Vibes form the basis of knowing, right?
[02:33] So at the the bottom of the the way in
[02:37] which we know. So the way in which we
[02:39] are able to know like first there are
[02:42] vibes and then on top of vibes we build
[02:45] more formal systems and we have to think
[02:47] of everything in that way.
[02:50] It's true and you know maybe uh so just
[02:53] an FYI Stephen we are live streaming
[02:55] this only on Noster um then it will be
[02:57] published via all the usual uh
[02:59] centralized platform channels later but
[03:02] uh where do we want to start with this?
[03:04] You as our fearless leader I feel like
[03:05] need to provide us some vibe based
[03:07] direction but what a what a whirlwind
[03:10] it's been. And also is that is that an
[03:12] official company tank that you're
[03:14] wearing there? Yes. Oh wow. Wow. Wow,
[03:18] look at that. It's taking the capital
[03:21] markets by storm. You know, I'm hearing
[03:23] from fund managers uh all over the
[03:25] world. They're they're loving the tank
[03:27] top. So, it's amazing to see the vest
[03:30] sales also skyrocket because I feel like
[03:33] VC funds were in kind of a a drought in
[03:35] terms of, you know, driving vest sales,
[03:38] but this is really what they needed was
[03:39] a vibes-based approach to vest sales.
[03:42] And I think we're seeing the the fruits
[03:44] of that right now. They need more
[03:45] sundresses that are appropriate. I know.
[03:49] I say amen to that. I say amen to that.
[03:52] Yeah, we're working on the sundresses
[03:54] and also, you know, it's not just vest
[03:56] sales that are in a drought with VC.
[03:58] It's VC funding period has been very
[04:01] low. And so we think we kind of have a
[04:03] solution for that here. I think capital
[04:06] providers they're just they're they're
[04:08] they're not you know if they have to
[04:10] attend another board meeting in Silicon
[04:12] Valley with some Patagonia vestw wearing
[04:14] MBAs it's like you want to you want to
[04:16] claw your eyes out like let's do in the
[04:19] sun tank tops give me a check for $10
[04:22] million it's going to be great I'm
[04:24] pretty sure Steve Jobs was actually a
[04:26] huge fan of uh walks in the sun for
[04:29] meetings and you know I feel like that
[04:31] was actually kind of marked the decline
[04:33] of of Silicon Valley more broadly was
[04:35] the movement away from walkbased
[04:38] meetings, you know, like and it's a it's
[04:41] a tradition as old as time too. Like
[04:42] this goes back to the Greeks and the
[04:43] Romans. Like why do we try to
[04:45] continually fix things that are not
[04:47] broken? What is that? It's anti- vibe
[04:50] culture really. They used to walk and
[04:52] philosophize. We're we're bringing that
[04:54] back.
[04:56] It's the best way. It's the best way. Do
[04:59] we want should we perhaps start actually
[05:00] just to set the stage with a quick uh
[05:03] round the horn introduction of everybody
[05:05] and your uh very official title at uh at
[05:08] Vibes Capital Management. May perhaps
[05:10] Stephen we uh we start with you. Yeah.
[05:12] So I'm one of the founders along with
[05:14] Bit Payne and I am the chief vibes
[05:16] officer for Vibes Capital Management. Uh
[05:18] and just a pleasure to be here. Yeah.
[05:21] Sam Bankmanf Freed. Uh over to you next.
[05:24] Yeah. Uh this is me SPF. Uh, I am the
[05:28] vice president of custodial services at
[05:30] Vibes Capital Management, aka uh the
[05:33] team's janitor,
[05:35] Max, and a very important hire for us.
[05:38] You know, it's hu huge hire. Yeah, a
[05:40] lot. It's It's very awkward. I'm still
[05:42] in my old office, obviously, the the the
[05:45] Bitcoin Policy Institute, but my uh you
[05:49] know, yeah, it's uh it's awkward. It's
[05:52] kind of like a breakup, but I'm you
[05:53] know, I can't make rent, so I'm still
[05:55] living with my ex. It's, you know, but
[05:57] the vibes are, despite this, the vibes
[05:58] are actually immaculate. Um, so just
[06:01] really, really, really excited to start
[06:03] this chapter of my career. Yeah. No, us
[06:06] too. And and I mean, we we got several
[06:08] great people from Bitcoin Policy
[06:10] Institute, which I'm sure is a blow. I
[06:12] mean, I know that's been hard to
[06:13] integrate, but uh it's just a just a
[06:16] direct correlation to my leadership. You
[06:18] know,
[06:20] the administration has embraced Bitcoin.
[06:23] They are on to better, more we're
[06:25] [ __ ] we're [ __ ] done. We wrapped
[06:26] it up, you know, they they they did the
[06:28] bit. They they said Bitcoin and then
[06:31] they made it illegal to not be a Bitcoin
[06:33] maximalist. So, you know, we're just
[06:35] phoning it in anyway. All right, boys.
[06:37] Job's done. Let's go home. I mean I
[06:39] mean, but really talk about a vibe
[06:41] shift, though. Like that. Like that's
[06:43] really what it was. Like a fundamental
[06:46] paradigmal altering vibe shift that you
[06:48] were able to orchestrate. I mean, how
[06:51] can you not move on to a vibes-based
[06:53] company after that? It's just it's a
[06:55] pure play vibe, you know? Yeah, I
[06:57] completely agree. Um, so yeah, Sam
[07:00] Bankman Freed reporting to uh unclog the
[07:03] the creatine poop.
[07:09] Mags, you want to follow that up?
[07:12] That was exciting. Much more serious. So
[07:15] I am the vibetoflow strategist of the
[07:17] strategic vibes reserve. Every company
[07:20] needs to establish a strategic vibes
[07:23] reserve. In fact, it's a national
[07:24] security imperative. Let's just leave it
[07:26] there. I like that approach. Rob, love
[07:31] it. My name is Robert Warren and you
[07:33] know I'm really I'm really here to
[07:35] reestablish what we have forgotten as a
[07:38] people which is that there are vibes and
[07:42] they should be noticed before they can
[07:44] be appreciated or or more importantly
[07:46] vibed with. So it's really a pleasure to
[07:48] be here as the the senior director of
[07:51] vibe noticing at Vibe Capital Management
[07:53] because this is this is the ground
[07:55] level. This is where the vibes which are
[07:58] already around us not being appreciated
[08:01] day by day. We really have to surface
[08:03] this in the consciousness of the average
[08:04] investor that the vibes are there.
[08:07] They've been there the whole time and
[08:09] they are immaculate and they want you to
[08:11] participate in them. So really it's it's
[08:14] the noticing that sets the stage for all
[08:15] future acting on the vibe. Well, and the
[08:18] noticing is a prerequisite for the vibes
[08:20] arbitrage which is one of the principal
[08:22] ways we make money as a fund. It's just
[08:24] cuz like you said the vibes are there.
[08:26] We're just kind of arving them. So well
[08:28] stated Sam. And this has been a like a
[08:31] huge oversight. Like you have funds that
[08:34] like you can invest in companies where
[08:37] the vibes are great and you can short
[08:40] companies where the vibes are terrible,
[08:42] but for some reason stinky vibes, it
[08:45] just doesn't fit into anyone's model.
[08:46] They're not doing this. And it's a just
[08:48] a you know, our arbitrage fund uh has
[08:50] done very well with the strategy. And
[08:53] even more critically, when you find
[08:55] those startups that have the right vibe,
[08:57] you know those are the ones that are
[08:59] going to make it. Like you know within
[09:00] the first five minutes, are the vibes
[09:02] there or the vibes off? Vibe check,
[09:04] guys. Right. And that's where you make
[09:06] your biggest returns. Absolutely.
[09:09] Speaking of vibe checks, uh this next uh
[09:12] speaker may need a vibe check, but uh
[09:14] we'll let him go anyway. Uh I believe
[09:17] he's here. We're not sure if he's he's
[09:19] going to stay with us the whole time on
[09:20] this on this call because of some things
[09:22] that were said earlier, but we'll we'll
[09:24] let him go for now. Uh Tatum Turnup, I
[09:27] believe. What was said earlier? What did
[09:30] I miss something that I said? Well, I'm
[09:33] Tatum Turnup. I am the managing director
[09:36] of ASIC Sourcing Strategy, abbreviated
[09:39] as always. Um, and I unlike unlike other
[09:45] sourcing, other procurement methods, we
[09:48] take the approach of answering all of
[09:51] those LinkedIn DMs, even if the account
[09:54] has nothing else on it. Um, you know,
[09:57] we're looking for diamonds in the rough.
[09:59] And you know what? There's a lot of
[10:01] rough out there, but there might be a
[10:03] lot of diamonds, too. So, I just vibe it
[10:05] out. See how the conversation goes.
[10:10] How many DMs do we get about AS6 uh in a
[10:14] given week? Uh I we got to increase our
[10:17] server capacity and upgrade our premium
[10:20] membership because I have made some I've
[10:22] tried to do those mass connections and I
[10:25] I'm up to like 50,000 connections and
[10:29] and all very real and legitimate people
[10:31] I think. Um, and most of them are
[10:33] deeming me to sell AS6, which I don't
[10:36] know why everyone is like freaking out
[10:38] about, you know, prices going up. I got
[10:40] plenty that are way cheaper. So, all
[10:43] right. You were front running uh those
[10:45] uh those tariffs based on a little bit
[10:47] of Vibe arbit arbitrage, it seems. So,
[10:49] that's that's great. Well, you know,
[10:52] I'll I'll take a moment just to I
[10:53] believe I'm actually the newest member
[10:55] of the uh Vibes Capital Management team.
[10:57] So, really happy to be part of this
[10:58] group. uh see uh SVP uh supreme vibes
[11:02] podcaster was happy to coordinate this
[11:05] vibe sesh this vibe cast I should say
[11:07] with all of you today. Did I yesterday
[11:10] buy about two dozen different vibes
[11:12] based domains that related to vibing and
[11:14] podcasting? Yes, I did. Yes, I did. And
[11:16] we love you for it. And was that an
[11:18] incredible financial decision?
[11:20] Absolutely. Yeah, 100%. Will those
[11:24] perform better than Bitcoin? Yes. I mean
[11:26] the vibe feels like yes. So yeah, the
[11:29] vibe is good. But I wanted to add these
[11:31] to our intellectual property also
[11:33] because I think that vibes based
[11:35] podcasting is really just kind of goes
[11:37] handinhand with vibes based investing.
[11:39] And that's why the Bitcoin podcast is
[11:41] really happy. You know, I'm basically
[11:42] like a Jack Mers where I'm keeping my
[11:44] role as chief podcasting officer, CPO of
[11:47] the Bitcoin podcast, but also moving
[11:49] into this tangential but complimentary
[11:51] role at the uh Vibes Capital Management.
[11:54] So I think I can walk and chew gum at
[11:56] the same time. We'll see. Absolutely.
[11:59] Absolutely. And you know like I mean
[12:00] look no further than the rise of vibes
[12:02] vibe coding right like this has become a
[12:05] huge phenomena and so vibe podcasting is
[12:08] next and you know I think the market
[12:11] wasn't exactly ready for Vibe Capital
[12:14] Management but uh here we are and we're
[12:16] going to carve out this uh terrain for
[12:18] our investors and uh shareholders.
[12:22] Yeah, it's it's a really exciting time
[12:24] to be here. And maybe, you know,
[12:25] Stephen, because I I think you've uh
[12:27] you've really explained this vibes-based
[12:29] approach very well and been kind of at
[12:31] the forefront of it very famously uh
[12:34] making a vibe-based call on the recent
[12:36] Bitcoin bottom. Um calling it quite
[12:39] perfectly. Can you explain the vibes at
[12:42] the time that led you to such a
[12:43] decision? And was this kind of one of
[12:45] the key things that made you realize,
[12:47] you know what, the vibes based investing
[12:49] approach is really the only path
[12:51] forward? Yeah. No, absolutely. Um, yeah,
[12:55] I've been uh kind of managing uh money,
[12:57] my own money and others. Um, kind of
[13:00] using this approach for a number of
[13:01] years. I think me and Bit Payne started
[13:03] talking about Vibes Capital Management
[13:05] back in late 2023 and we've just kind of
[13:09] been in stealth mode. Um but in that
[13:12] recent bottom call so you know I was
[13:14] very vocal and public um that the bottom
[13:18] was in this was Sunday evening it was
[13:20] actually during the futures open
[13:22] so the tariff fear had gripped the
[13:26] market right and everyone was worried
[13:28] about terrible vibes you know S&P was
[13:32] very low bitcoin was in the 70s and uh
[13:35] everyone was talking about black Monday
[13:38] we're going to have a black Monday there
[13:40] was this thing that was going around.
[13:41] You might remember it. And and the
[13:43] futures opened and the futures opened
[13:45] down like four or 5% on the S&P. And in
[13:50] that
[13:51] moment, I just felt it was it was peak
[13:56] bad vibes, peak fear. Everyone was
[13:59] betting on calamity the next day. And I
[14:03] saw a report that uh Scott Bessant had
[14:08] flown to Mara Lago that Sunday to talk
[14:11] with Trump. And Lutnik had been very at
[14:13] the forefront doing all the all the
[14:16] media, talking to everybody, doing all
[14:18] of that. And you know, Lutnik had bad
[14:20] vibes a little to a certain degree. He
[14:22] was he was harsh. He you know, he was
[14:24] bringing down the vibe on the market,
[14:26] talking, you know, really intensely. And
[14:29] uh I just realized that like Bessant was
[14:32] coming to talk with Trump. Now Bessant
[14:34] has had good vibes. Bessent has been
[14:36] just in the forefront trying to manage
[14:38] the vibes and I realized
[14:41] between the sense that the vibes had
[14:44] gotten as low as they could go. Everyone
[14:46] was scared and we had kind of an
[14:48] ambassador
[14:50] uh of good vibes coming to manage the
[14:53] situation. That's when I made that, you
[14:54] know, that bottom call. And, you know,
[14:56] if you bought Bitcoin, then it was in
[14:58] the it was in the 70s and you bought the
[15:00] S&P, you're up quite a bit. If you
[15:02] bought stocks, I mean, you can't really
[15:04] have lost if you invested then. And it's
[15:07] because it was a it was a vibe pivot
[15:10] point. It was a moment where the vibes
[15:14] were moving from terrible to good. And
[15:17] we've been in a recovery since then. And
[15:20] many people have questioned, "Oh, but
[15:22] yields have moved higher. Oh, but
[15:24] valuations. Oh, but this, but there's
[15:26] still tariff impact. There's still
[15:28] economic impact. There's all these
[15:29] things happening." You don't understand.
[15:31] It's about the rate of change in the
[15:33] vibes. And the vibes have been improving
[15:36] every week. As long as the vibes keep
[15:38] improving, asset prices trend higher.
[15:42] I mean, this is really kind of a uh it's
[15:45] such a simple thesis, but really isn't
[15:48] simplicity ultimately the best when it
[15:51] comes to these sorts of decisions. I
[15:53] think so much in the fiat world has been
[15:55] over complicated. It has been
[15:57] nonvibes-based. It's I believe you
[15:59] called it uh in one of our recent uh
[16:01] recent meetings of VCM, you called it
[16:04] the
[16:05] spreadsheetification of these uh you
[16:07] know of these investment uh decisions.
[16:09] And I think that really a return to a
[16:12] return to vibes is just a return to
[16:14] common sense. And ultimately, I guess,
[16:16] you know, I'm curious what everyone's
[16:18] thoughts. I mean, is Bitcoin just the
[16:20] ultimate vibe? Is that why it's really
[16:23] should be the cornerstone of any
[16:25] vibes-based investing approach? I think
[16:27] you raised a really good point and I
[16:29] think Stephen maybe you're the you're
[16:30] best uh able to talk about this but we
[16:33] recently had a conversation with a large
[16:36] capital allocator and he finally got
[16:39] bitcoin because he's like it's just
[16:42] vibes why why don't you take it from
[16:44] there yeah so um recently uh we were
[16:48] fortunate enough to engage with a uh you
[16:50] know a large capital manager tens of
[16:52] billions of dollars who was engaged and
[16:56] inspired by the Vibes Capital Management
[16:58] story and he was following the firm and
[17:01] the launch of the firm and um he
[17:04] actually was texting he was texting uh
[17:06] David and and David was texting me and
[17:08] we were all talking and you know
[17:09] basically the breakthrough was that
[17:12] Bitcoin is a vibe and prior to
[17:14] understanding that Bitcoin is a vibe uh
[17:17] some of these asset managers were trying
[17:21] to fit Bitcoin into an existing
[17:24] investment model free cash flows,
[17:27] certain government models, all of these
[17:29] things. They're trying to put Bitcoin
[17:31] into a spreadsheet, into a formula, into
[17:35] a way of thinking about these things.
[17:37] And there really was no way to value
[17:39] Bitcoin. People have talked about this
[17:41] forever. And
[17:45] um it's realizing and it and it was this
[17:48] capital allocator realizing you can't do
[17:50] that. Bitcoin doesn't fit into that.
[17:53] Bitcoin is a vibe and it's one of the
[17:56] best vibes in the world and you can
[17:58] chart its success as a vibe over the
[18:00] last over a decade. And once you realize
[18:04] that that's what it is and that Bitcoin
[18:07] investing is vibes investing, then this
[18:10] all starts to make sense. If you're
[18:12] stuck spending dollars, at least stop
[18:14] earning dirty fiat rewards. Use Fold to
[18:18] earn Bitcoin on everyday purchases and
[18:20] regular expenses, groceries, bills,
[18:23] travel, home improvement. I literally
[18:25] just earned
[18:27] 2,23 sats buying a $100 Amazon gift card
[18:31] on Fold. You don't even need to use the
[18:33] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[18:36] You can connect your favorite credit
[18:37] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[18:40] on merchant offers or go allin. Make
[18:43] Fold the center of your personal

[20:16] it's meant to be used. That's bit ti.
[20:22] And I think a good way to think about it
[20:24] if you're coming from the legacy market,
[20:26] right? Trapy. Think about Goodwill,
[20:28] right? How much Goodwill does Apple
[20:30] have? How much Goodwill has Meta? Any of
[20:33] these companies, right?
[20:36] The equivalent comparison is Bitcoin has
[20:39] vibes like Goodwill. That's the next
[20:42] level. There's there's this underlying
[20:44] kind of technical trend that we've seen
[20:47] historically, right? Where you reach a
[20:49] certain echelon of technical complexity
[20:52] and advancement. And people like to
[20:55] think of this as kind of the inevitable
[20:56] progression of man that we we gradually
[20:59] add complexity to the system. But what
[21:01] we're what we're saying here at Vibes
[21:03] Capital is something that's
[21:04] fundamentally different. What we're
[21:05] saying is that when technical innovation
[21:07] and complexity reaches a certain zenith,
[21:10] it actually collapses into something
[21:12] more simple, which is the vibe. And
[21:15] we've seen this, you know, Bitcoin just
[21:17] happens to be the most uh the most
[21:19] vibiest of the vibes of recent history.
[21:22] It has has the most resonance to it. But
[21:24] if you remember the first time you ever
[21:26] cracked open an
[21:27] iPhone and it was that one button and it
[21:30] was that screen that was like nothing
[21:32] else you'd seen in your entire life. And
[21:34] that wasn't actually added complexity.
[21:36] The complexity was in the system. All
[21:38] the engineering that had gone into
[21:40] building the iPhone, but the second you
[21:42] open up the iPhone, it all collapses
[21:44] into the vibe. And the vibe is the new
[21:46] world of the smartphone. And so what
[21:48] we're really experiencing and where we
[21:50] where our expertise lives in generating
[21:52] all of this alpha is in recognizing that
[21:55] we haven't actually had to invest in the
[21:58] next more complex thing. We've focused
[22:01] our alpha and our investment on where
[22:04] has complexity collapsed into good
[22:07] vibes.
[22:09] The complexity is within the simplicity.
[22:12] That's right.
[22:14] True. True. You know, I think uh another
[22:17] thing that's just worth harping on is I
[22:21] think a lot of people in this space uh
[22:22] they think about the distinction between
[22:25] custodial and non-custodial services um
[22:29] you know in a very sort of poor vibe.
[22:31] It's they're far too polarized. They
[22:33] think if it's custodial it's it's bad.
[22:35] If it's non-custodial it's good. Uh the
[22:39] my last venture um FTX and and Alamita
[22:43] uh we didn't blow up because we were
[22:46] custodial. BlockFi, Celsius, uh these
[22:49] companies didn't blow up because they
[22:51] were custodial. Uh they they blew up
[22:53] because the vibes were bad. Uh in the
[22:56] same way that if your vibes are bad and
[22:58] you're self-custodying your digital
[23:00] asset, uh you things can blow up, right?
[23:02] you try to have a a geographically
[23:04] distributed multi-IG and you uh you know
[23:07] you forget where you buried the damn
[23:09] thing, right? like uh and that's just
[23:11] something I'm really excited to pioneer
[23:12] with this with this new venture is is
[23:14] recognizing that if you trust us with
[23:16] your assets um the the security from our
[23:20] custodial services comes not from our
[23:22] our opsacc or our uh uh you know our our
[23:26] sort of you know our tech our backend uh
[23:30] you know we we secure your funds uh with
[23:32] with good vibes uh and to my knowledge
[23:35] uh there's never been a hack a loss a
[23:37] theft uh from any custodian that's ever
[23:40] treated user funds uh with the vibes
[23:42] they deserve. And I think that's the VCM
[23:44] guarantee. When you park money with us,
[23:46] uh you know, we're going to vibe out
[23:48] with it. You have to realize that uh to
[23:52] do something bad, right? Like to make a
[23:54] reckless decision with user funds or to
[23:57] set up kind of a single point of failure
[23:59] that has no backups or to, you know,
[24:01] just take a reckless security decision
[24:04] before the action. There is a bad vibe.
[24:08] To even do the bad action, you need to
[24:11] first enter into a bad vibe. And the
[24:14] action follows from the vibe. The vibes
[24:17] are like ontologically primary. And this
[24:19] is what we want people to understand
[24:21] really. We're innovating on a level of
[24:24] direct experience of phenomenological
[24:27] direct experience. And what you can do
[24:30] is you can just if you notice the vibes
[24:33] in the right way as Rob was talking
[24:35] about, you can
[24:38] phenomenologically ontologically discern
[24:42] the arising of bad vibes before they
[24:46] turn into bad
[24:47] actions. That's very evident throughout
[24:50] history as you've seen. remember uh one
[24:53] of the most prevalent uh examples that
[24:56] we see recorded in history, Pearl
[24:59] Harbor. There were awful vibes pre Pearl
[25:01] Harbor and those actions resulted from
[25:04] those vibes.
[25:07] You know how harsh, but how about this?
[25:09] You know what we can talk about? The
[25:11] vibes during the French Revolution were
[25:14] absolutely terrible. And I think that
[25:17] ultimately what what do many of these
[25:19] bad vibes stem from? It comes from
[25:21] distortions in the market, right? It
[25:23] comes from distortions in the market
[25:25] created by the debasement of the
[25:28] currency. Because what does that
[25:29] ultimately represent? It represents a
[25:33] disharmonic frequency. It represents
[25:35] something that is it is destroy
[25:37] literally an active uh wave destroying
[25:40] the vibes. Whereas there can be
[25:42] harmonics when the vibes are good. This
[25:45] just creates a completely discordant
[25:47] market that is ultimately brought about
[25:49] by debasement. And what does it lead to?
[25:50] Well, it leads to death, destruction,
[25:52] and the guillotine. I mean, and that's
[25:54] ultimately like that's when you want to
[25:55] see how bad vibes can get. I say I say
[25:58] look no further than the French
[25:59] Revolution. But that's just me. And so
[26:01] you have to think about how you get to
[26:03] the good vibes. There are actions that
[26:06] create good vibes. And that's where you
[26:07] look at the word vibe as a verb. You
[26:10] have to vibe. You have to vibe around.
[26:12] You got to I'm just vibing. you know,
[26:14] that's how you kind of engage those good
[26:17] vibes to create the good times.
[26:21] You and you make a great point. Uh you
[26:23] both touch on something important and
[26:24] Walker, you said the word kind of
[26:26] harmonization and and this theme of
[26:28] harmony, I think, is actually really
[26:30] clear here. What it what
[26:32] ites root is that there is a natural
[26:36] order to the world and that when things
[26:39] are in their right place, there is
[26:42] harmony. where there is harmony, there
[26:44] are good vibes. And um in the east,
[26:47] there's a concept called the
[26:49] rectification of names. And so this is
[26:52] this kind of confusion concept of saying
[26:55] giving everything its right name. For
[26:59] example, you know, if you have an oak
[27:01] tree in your backyard, but you think it
[27:05] is a uh a tomato plant and you treat it
[27:08] like a tomato plant, that oak tree is
[27:10] not going to thrive. You need to know
[27:12] its nature. You need to know its nature.
[27:14] You need to name its nature. And you
[27:16] need to treat things in accordance with
[27:18] their nature. And so vibes, what they
[27:21] really result from is everything being
[27:25] in its right place in accordance with
[27:28] its own nature. And that's what we try
[27:31] to do. and where we're trying to blend
[27:35] and unify capital management with the
[27:39] proper order and flow of the universe.
[27:43] It's about doing the the right vibes at
[27:45] the right times for the right reasons.
[27:47] You know, this is just sort of ancient
[27:49] wisdom and truly cyclical. Yeah. Oh, you
[27:53] know, it is something that fits within I
[27:55] think the the age-old quote was probably
[27:57] misstated because really what we should
[27:59] say is that bad vibes create strong men,
[28:03] strong men create good
[28:06] vibes, good vibes create weak men, and
[28:09] weak men create bad vibes. And really,
[28:12] it's uh it's a name of as as Stephen is
[28:15] referencing naming things and not lying.
[28:17] We really are in that time right now
[28:19] where we have to be the ones to create
[28:21] the good vibes. So, while we may be
[28:23] early, in some sense, we've arrived just
[28:26] on time when the vibes were right for
[28:28] the increasing of the vibes. You know,
[28:31] Rob, I'm so glad you brought that up
[28:33] because I think we were actually
[28:34] vibrating on the same frequency there
[28:36] cuz I was thinking the same thing. But
[28:38] as I was thinking through it, I was
[28:39] wondering if I could justify good vibes
[28:41] creating weak men because perhaps this
[28:44] actually flips the script a little bit.
[28:46] And perhaps good vibes can also create
[28:48] good men. Are you saying it's a super
[28:50] cycle of vibes? It that's it might be.
[28:53] It just ends up only forever.
[28:57] It might be.
[28:59] This is hotly contested in the vibe uh
[29:01] the vibe literature. You know, it's a
[29:03] question of can you can you create good
[29:06] vibes such that they are oscillating at
[29:09] a frequency that self- sustains. And
[29:11] really this is our emphasis on on the
[29:13] noticing and the education of the vibes.
[29:15] Because when the vibes are good is at
[29:18] that very moment that you are most
[29:19] likely to forget in fact that the vibes
[29:22] are good. Vulnerability is there. Had
[29:24] you not experienced the bad vi bad bad
[29:26] vibes or the rising vibes or the falling
[29:28] of the vibes, you might believe that
[29:30] this is just the way the vibe is. And
[29:32] and this is this is really the greater
[29:34] mission of what we're doing with uh with
[29:36] Vibes Capital Management is is not just
[29:39] to establish that we are those who are
[29:42] with the rising of the vibes. We are
[29:44] we're generating alpha but if we can
[29:47] truly reach the next level which is the
[29:49] in some sense escape from the circle of
[29:51] vibes which is a far more a far more
[29:53] difficult task to undertake.
[29:56] You know, I'm wondering did did Ray
[29:58] Dalio Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, Max. Then
[30:01] I'll talk about Ray Dalio's uh long-term
[30:02] vibe cycles because I think that's
[30:04] really what he was getting at. We can
[30:05] launch into that right right away, but
[30:07] just to finish that last thought off,
[30:09] Rob, especially, you know, what VCM does
[30:13] is we are harnessing those vibes, right?
[30:14] We are capturing them really. We're a
[30:17] digital battery for vibes.
[30:20] Yes. Oh, yes. I like that. Yes. We we
[30:24] really we really can store digital
[30:27] energy in a in a literal and
[30:30] non-metaphorical way. There's literally
[30:32] energy that can be um reaccessed at a
[30:36] later point in time in the form of
[30:38] vibes. All right, guys. It's getting a
[30:39] little too real right now. Can vibe can
[30:42] you encrypt a vibe? Yeah. Is that well
[30:46] the time by the time you need to encrypt
[30:48] vibes you won't have to because that's
[30:50] quantum right
[30:52] quantum resistance vibes well I mean
[30:55] like if you think about it like perhaps
[30:57] like vibes gets down to the idea of like
[31:00] the the zero point field you know and
[31:02] like I mean but maybe that's that's too
[31:04] deep for this conversation. I do want to
[31:06] get your guys' thoughts on Ray Dalio
[31:09] adapting his theory of of debt cycles.
[31:11] Perhaps we're looking at ultimately
[31:13] long-term vibe cycles. And this gets
[31:15] back to the idea of human action, right?
[31:18] It's these naturally cyclical patterns
[31:21] that emerge. What are those except vibe
[31:24] shifts ultimately, right? Turning is a
[31:27] vibe shift.
[31:30] Is a vibe shift. That should be a quote
[31:31] coming out of this this episode. Yeah.
[31:34] Yeah. And ultimately, I mean, we can
[31:36] even get into like the contraative
[31:38] cycles if we want to. And I think that
[31:40] we're seeing right now a cyclical uh a
[31:42] cyclical vibe convergence. We might call
[31:45] it a a confluence of vibes at this
[31:47] particular moment in history. And I
[31:49] think that's something that ultimately
[31:51] most capital allocators aren't paying
[31:53] attention to. And I think that's why
[31:56] they will continue to underperform. They
[31:58] don't understand the confluence of
[32:00] different vibes and their amplification
[32:02] that happens as a result of that
[32:05] confluence. Like this is what I I think
[32:07] people are totally going to be
[32:08] misallocated. They don't understand it.
[32:11] They're not looking for it and they do
[32:13] not know how to construct a portfolio of
[32:17] assets that asymmetrically benefits from
[32:21] this event and that is what we're
[32:23] focused on doing. They don't they have
[32:26] no model of which investments are the
[32:30] biggest beneficiaries of this
[32:32] confluence. And that asymmetry is
[32:35] something that our fund our first fund
[32:38] uh vibes cap signal one uh is rooted
[32:41] around.
[32:42] Yeah. If you look at the the 0ero to one
[32:44] thesis which while a very powerful
[32:46] thesis is still been funded
[32:48] predominantly by this um this
[32:52] hyperinvestment type mentality. this
[32:54] kind of soft bank fiat-minded, let me
[32:57] dump tens of billions of dollars into
[32:59] something and try to really kickstart
[33:02] this engine and just force it into
[33:04] existence. That's fundamentally a bad
[33:06] vibe. Yes. What we're doing by by
[33:09] finding the confluence of these vibes is
[33:11] really more of a 1 + 1 equals three
[33:14] situation where if we can correctly
[33:17] identify these confluence points and and
[33:19] these investments, that is immediate
[33:22] value ad. We don't dump tens of billions
[33:25] of dollars into something to try to
[33:26] force the vibe. We've already recognized
[33:29] the vibe. The hard work is done. The
[33:31] second the investment is made. We've
[33:32] already had that 1 plus 1 equals 3
[33:35] moment.
[33:36] You know, this just reminds me of
[33:39] um the uh the story of the dexterous
[33:43] butcher. I don't know if you've ever
[33:44] heard this in the Chinese parable and
[33:46] it's about a butcher who is butchering
[33:48] an ox and
[33:50] um basically an an average butcher comes
[33:54] to the king to take care of this ox and
[33:57] you know he notices that he's he's uh
[34:00] his knife his carving knife is worn.
[34:02] He's having to sharpen it and he's
[34:04] hacking through the ax. And then one day
[34:07] the king meets a dexterous busher and he
[34:09] noticed that his uh his carving
[34:13] knife, it's like it's it's never been
[34:15] dulled. The blade is perfectly sharp.
[34:18] And when he watches this butcher carve
[34:20] the ax, it just falls apart. It's like
[34:23] he knows exactly where to put the knife.
[34:25] So he doesn't have to force his way
[34:28] through the ax. He knows how to flow
[34:30] with the ax. He knows how to cut in a
[34:32] way which is in harmony with it. And as
[34:34] such, he never needs to sharpen his
[34:36] knife because he understands the nature
[34:39] and the confluence of the various forces
[34:42] that compose the ax. And that's what
[34:44] we're doing for capital
[34:47] markets. Wow. Basically, the capital
[34:51] market is the ax. We flow through it
[34:54] like like a perfectly sharpened knife
[34:56] that never need be sharpened
[34:59] again. Perhaps perhaps honed, but not
[35:02] sharpened. It already has its edge. And
[35:04] it keeps that edge. Yeah. Just like the
[35:07] butcher ding. Um and this
[35:10] is, you know, it's this concept of
[35:13] cultivation too. And that's something uh
[35:15] to talk about
[35:18] that really being in harmony with the
[35:21] best
[35:22] vibes is a cultivation. It takes
[35:25] conscious attention. It takes the honing
[35:28] of attention, the cultivation of inner
[35:31] awareness of outer awareness and the
[35:34] removal of obstacles and obstructions
[35:37] within oneself. And so I mean this is a
[35:40] key part of like you know our core
[35:43] training program, employee training, HR
[35:46] intake process. We're really cultivating
[35:48] that refined sensitive internal
[35:52] awareness. Uh and and this is what gives
[35:54] us our edge. I am definitely not a
[35:57] trader. I'm trying to hold my Bitcoin
[35:59] for the long term. And if you're like
[36:01] me, you need to make sure you keep that

[37:09] So, thank you.
[37:11] Yeah, I think Oh, please, please. Oh,
[37:14] sorry. I was just going to ask him in
[37:15] inside baseball if we were still doing
[37:17] the um the permaculture training during
[37:20] our ongoing company retreats.
[37:24] uh what you're talking about cultivation
[37:26] reminds me of what we've done in prior
[37:27] years and uh just if we might surface
[37:30] that as a way to really emphasize to the
[37:31] investing class that it's less about
[37:33] it's less about sitting on a yacht. It's
[37:35] less about going to the golf course, but
[37:37] it's more about this um this per
[37:40] permaculture idea of of of getting what
[37:43] you can and and optimizing it through
[37:45] the lens of what the earth will give you
[37:47] herself. This was your book, right? You
[37:50] wrote the permaculture of capital
[37:51] markets.
[37:53] That was in 2014. Yes.
[37:57] Very good.
[37:59] I think that's interesting because it
[38:00] ultimately gets back to these these
[38:02] natural cycles, right? And it's
[38:04] interesting if we think about uh animals
[38:06] and how good animals are at detecting
[38:08] vibes, right? How good also children are
[38:12] up to a certain age at detecting vibes.
[38:16] We lose that at some point as adults. I
[38:18] think most of us do if if we again we
[38:21] don't continue to hone that kind of vibe
[38:23] uh that vibe awareness. It's like
[38:25] society is suppressing that honestly
[38:27] because how do we get back to that
[38:28] though? Look look look at the innocence
[38:31] of children. Look at the innocence of
[38:33] dogs. Look at service animals that know
[38:35] when you're about to have a seizure like
[38:37] those are vibes that are that they're
[38:39] they're getting there. Earthquakes too
[38:41] like and so many other things. But and
[38:44] you know children also they may get bad
[38:47] vibes from people and but we lose that
[38:51] as we get older. Society is wanting us
[38:54] to conform to a pattern that is created
[38:58] rather than just go with the vibes.
[39:01] Absolutely. Absolutely. This is what
[39:04] Martin Buber said, you know, his his his
[39:06] kind of dialogue on why we've lost the
[39:10] essence of like I thou relationship is
[39:12] society has has constricted us. We've
[39:15] constricted everybody. And so really
[39:17] vibes capital management is like a human
[39:19] potential movement. You know, we're just
[39:21] we're not we're not settling for a base
[39:24] metal here.
[39:26] Yeah. I mean that although you know some
[39:29] of those base metals do have incredible
[39:31] resonance. We we can't deny that. But
[39:34] ultimately, they can't resonate in
[39:36] cyerspace, which I think is the the key
[39:39] shortfall there.
[39:41] Yeah. And also, I think like Peter
[39:43] Schiff, I don't know if he pursues a
[39:45] vibes-based investing approach. I'm just
[39:47] going to if we're still talking about,
[39:49] you know, metals. Yeah. I mean, we can
[39:50] tell that he doesn't have a a vibe
[39:53] strategy.
[39:54] I mean, sort of an old order vibe
[39:56] strategy, you know? Yeah. He at one
[39:58] point was was vibing and he he didn't
[40:02] adapt his vibes. The vibes they are a
[40:05] changing. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. You can lose
[40:09] you can lose access, you know. That's a
[40:11] that's a that's a story, right? Like you
[40:13] can be in a good relationship uh and you
[40:16] can lose it. You know, you can lose it.
[40:17] Like the mandate of heaven, you know,
[40:19] it's like you can have it, you can lose
[40:20] it. Uh I think Peter lost it
[40:22] unfortunately because he didn't he
[40:24] wasn't able to evolve to Bitcoin. You
[40:27] know, it's a sad story. And for those
[40:29] listening live, I know it's a crisp uh
[40:32] 10:41 Mountain time, but uh drinking
[40:35] game, take a shot every time you hear
[40:36] the word vibe on this podcast.
[40:40] I I' I'd like to give a a shout out to
[40:43] uh to Lightning Goats, who is uh who is
[40:45] in the live stream and is usually in
[40:47] these live streams. Uh and if you
[40:49] haven't checked out Lightning Goats and
[40:51] Zapped some sats to feed goats, it is
[40:54] like the coolest thing ever. Um, so
[40:56] yeah, you should if you just search
[40:58] lightning goats on YouTube, uh, you will
[41:00] find them and they're adorable. And you
[41:02] can literally feed them by zapping sats,
[41:04] which is just like it's such a vibe.
[41:06] Like that that is that is like peak
[41:08] vibes, you know, feeding goats from
[41:10] anywhere in the world by zapping sats.
[41:13] Like that's beautiful. We need more kind
[41:16] of vibe projects. They're just vibing.
[41:19] You get to watch them vibe.
[41:21] Did you know that goats and I learn I
[41:23] learned this from uh from lightning
[41:25] goats because he came on uh on this show
[41:28] and goats you should never only get one
[41:31] uh you should always get two goats
[41:33] because they need companionship. They
[41:35] vibe together and I thought that was
[41:37] kind of beautiful. So like if you have
[41:38] just one goat they're going to be a bit
[41:39] honory and they may be they may be
[41:41] misbehaving but you get two of them then
[41:44] they start to vibe and again I think
[41:46] that's that amplification right there.
[41:48] You know, that's kind of a goat vibe
[41:50] confluence. Kind of just like a Bitcoin,
[41:52] right? You should never get one, you
[41:54] should get two. A lot to be said there.
[41:58] There really is. There really is.
[41:59] Zuckerberg has two goats. He does. Oh,
[42:01] that's right. Bitcoin and something
[42:03] else. Max, I think the other one Max.
[42:05] Yeah. Which vibe? I know. I mean, is
[42:09] that is that Maximalist? Yeah. Yeah. I
[42:12] mean, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[42:15] He has had an interesting vibe shift uh
[42:18] for an extra. He's a great example of a
[42:20] vibe shift. I mean, ju just look at like
[42:24] some someone put it in a way of uh when
[42:28] a nerd goes on Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan
[42:32] feels smarter and the nerd feels cooler.
[42:35] And it's how you follow that that really
[42:38] defines who you are. And I think that
[42:40] Zuckerberg really fully enhanced that
[42:43] vibe shift post Rogan. I am going to So,
[42:46] we're going to do a real time example.
[42:48] So, I'm going to find out when
[42:50] Zuckerberg went through the vibe shift
[42:52] and we're going to see how Facebook
[42:53] stock has performed since then. It's a
[42:56] good question.
[42:58] Wow. Yeah. You know, most funds would be
[43:01] terrified to share their
[43:03] proprietary, you know, valuation models,
[43:06] but at Vibes Capital, We are very open
[43:10] source vibes. Yeah. So, look at this
[43:13] guys. So, he changed it. I'm not even
[43:16] kidding. I'm not making this up. It his
[43:18] vibe shift occurred at the end of 2023
[43:21] and early 2024. If you look at the meta
[43:24] stock, it literally bottoms in 2023 and
[43:30] it has done nothing but it was at, let's
[43:31] just take the kind of conservative point
[43:34] there. It was at $240 a share. It is at
[43:38] $653 a share today in just under two
[43:42] years immediately following Zuckerberg's
[43:45] vibe shift. The difference though is
[43:47] that the we what we're wanting to do is
[43:51] bring those vibes to to market. You
[43:54] know, they have a vibe strategy
[43:55] obviously because we we've seen the
[43:57] shift and we've seen the results, but
[43:59] they're keeping it close to the chest
[44:00] and we're we're wanting to bring that to
[44:02] the public. We want to give access to
[44:05] Vibes. Well, is it a coincidence also,
[44:07] and Stephen, I defer to you on this one,
[44:09] that during at at the start of that vibe
[44:12] shift, you notice he started getting a
[44:14] lot more tan. There was a lot more sun
[44:16] involved outside more. Interesting. I
[44:19] mean, the ultimate vibe giver is the
[44:21] sun. If if fair statement to make
[44:25] the sun like so there's I think you want
[44:28] there's nuance here. So I think the
[44:31] sun is the physical representation of
[44:35] the source of vibes in this world and in
[44:38] a in a in kind of a physical sense
[44:41] physical vibes are emanated from the
[44:44] sun. But there is almost a metaphysical
[44:46] sun of which the physical sun is a uh is
[44:50] a is a placeholder that exists in the
[44:53] inner landscape that is the true source
[44:55] of vibes. And you know, I think just
[44:58] drawing this line very closely between
[45:01] like ontological source and
[45:04] manifestation in the world. And it's
[45:07] it's the inner sun and the outer sun.
[45:09] So, you know, when Zuckerberg is going
[45:11] out in the sun and he's sunaxing and
[45:13] he's getting tan, he's getting his
[45:14] vitamin D up, it's he is uh you know,
[45:17] he's achieving vibes from, you know,
[45:20] kind of the center of the solar system.
[45:22] We got Matt Pine joining us. Oh, yeah.
[45:24] Let me let me let me get this on the Mac
[45:27] speakers. Wonderful. Special guest
[45:29] appearance.
[45:31] Matt Pines, the magic happens live. You
[45:34] know, we're just cooking. We're cooking
[45:35] here. A man who is highly cognizant of
[45:37] the vibes. Good to see you. Thanks for
[45:40] having me. You know, I love to just drop
[45:41] in on podcast here. David Zel, Sam
[45:43] Bakeman Freed here. Yeah.
[45:46] Uh, Matt, would you would you care to
[45:48] perhaps just uh I don't know, shower us
[45:51] with some uh some vibes based knowledge?
[45:54] How do you look at the idea of vibes and
[45:56] vibes based investing? Is this something
[45:58] that you are attuned to or are your
[46:00] vibes concentrated in a different area?
[46:04] I
[46:05] mean, if I if I'm honest, the whole
[46:07] thing is a scam. The whole thing is just
[46:09] a rug pull to sell t-shirts here, you
[46:12] know? Like like the airdrop is coming. I
[46:15] I see it on Stephen's face. You know,
[46:17] he's just setting up for the for the
[46:19] rugpool. He's trying to poach all of all
[46:21] of my staff. You know, I'm I'm
[46:24] threatened by this. The vibe the vibe is
[46:26] malevolent. The vibe the vibe is
[46:27] hostile. And I will and I I will react
[46:30] to it, you know, in kind at a place and
[46:32] time of my choosing. Wow. Set ourselves
[46:35] up for that one. That's crazy. And well,
[46:38] I will pass that feedback on to the uh
[46:41] five uh employees of yours that now work
[46:43] for it. I I'll let them know that that's
[46:45] how you feel. You know, I'm going to
[46:48] have my Vibe uh antitrust lawyers slap a
[46:51] uh slap a lawsuit and a restraining
[46:53] order. Uh you know, ASAP going to have
[46:56] Mr. Elon uh boost you and uh yeah, we're
[47:00] going to the trenches. It's uh it's got
[47:02] to be very negative vibes over here,
[47:04] guys. This is harsh vibe. This is a
[47:05] harsh vibe. You can deboost us all you
[47:07] want. We're on noster. It's okay. You
[47:09] guys need to understand something. Matt
[47:11] has launched a competitor fund. He is
[47:14] talking his book. He is running
[47:16] ventures. They're noetic insight trading
[47:20] firm. And so this is not an unbiased
[47:22] take. Not only is he salty that uh a lot
[47:25] of his best people wanted to come work
[47:27] for us, but he is running a competitor.
[47:30] So, you know, like like the Fields Early
[47:32] Fund is is uh is in syndication right
[47:35] now and we're taking we're taking LBs.
[47:38] Um the Noetics Group uh family of
[47:40] portfolio companies is, you know, we're
[47:42] ambitious. We're we're coming for you.
[47:45] Um so, take your vibes and, you know,
[47:47] have fun, but you know, party's over.
[47:50] Wow. I'm playing with your vibes. Yeah.
[47:53] Yeah. You know, do you play with the
[47:56] vibes or do the vibes play with you? You
[47:57] know what I mean?
[47:59] That's a good question.
[48:02] Matt's never asked you and the vibes.
[48:04] Correct. I mean, methodologically, we've
[48:07] we've spent most of our efforts vibing
[48:09] with the vibes where I know Matt, you
[48:11] know, big respect that he is he is
[48:12] pursuing this new venture, but we've
[48:14] we've found that because he does pursue
[48:16] it in such an objectivist kind of way to
[48:19] us, it's not our alpha generation
[48:21] strategy. You know, he's looking for the
[48:22] study. He has to go to the desert. He
[48:25] has to point the satellites towards the
[48:26] sky.
[48:28] We simply vibe and we can do it from
[48:30] everywhere. I do feel he has a
[48:32] competitive advantage though. I have
[48:34] heard you know we have been doing some
[48:35] of our own due diligence underground and
[48:37] you know he's got some UAP technology
[48:40] that's helping him assess. Yeah. Yeah. I
[48:43] mean I mean the the jellyfish tell me
[48:46] exactly what to buy and when or else
[48:48] they kidnap me. Jeez. We don't have any
[48:50] jellyfish yet. Uh so jellyfish are kind
[48:53] of a vibe though. I was about to say for
[48:56] sure. Yeah. I mean, yeah, they're vibes.
[48:58] I mean, they're it's one of those vibes
[49:00] you definitely want to like, you know,
[49:01] lick your finger before you touch,
[49:03] right? It's uh it's uh it's high risk,
[49:05] high reward there. You know, you go out
[49:06] into the desert, you summon the demons,
[49:08] you know, be careful what what you uh
[49:10] what you bring in. Uh David knows about
[49:12] this. Are there are there different that
[49:15] they're they're very respondent to the
[49:17] vibes? Yeah. If you have good vibes, you
[49:20] get good jellyfish. And if you have, you
[49:23] know, the the the jellyfish become your
[49:25] sort of moral or vibes dessert, right?
[49:27] Like you sort of get you get that which
[49:29] you are due. It turns out karma is an
[49:31] objective fact, right? You have a pulse
[49:33] meter running in the background of your
[49:34] of your soul at at all times. Like I'm
[49:37] looking at at zels right now and he's
[49:39] he's digging out of I'm in a bare
[49:41] market. He's uh he's sold off he sold
[49:44] off his personal equity to uh to some
[49:46] interventional demon on some acid trip
[49:48] five years ago and now he's he's
[49:50] shitcoining to sort of you know uh
[49:53] please the please the please the
[49:55] civilian lord. Uh but you know we're
[49:57] we're here to save his his immortal
[49:59] Bitcoin soul. So that's what we're
[50:01] doing. Yeah. We're not just shilling
[50:03] Bitcoin to America's leadership. We're
[50:05] really uh a matter of spiritual
[50:07] salvation. That's that's where this is.
[50:09] That sounds like a vibes-based approach
[50:12] though. Oh,
[50:14] [ __ ] Wait, are we talking Are we
[50:16] talking mergers, guys? Holy [ __ ] Is M&A
[50:19] activity in the vibes economy just
[50:21] mooning right now? There's a unique
[50:23] strategy.
[50:25] But about to be a vibe tank. It's no
[50:28] longer a think tank. It's just it's a
[50:30] vibe tank. Always always has been,
[50:33] Walker.
[50:34] Wow. It's all coming together now. It
[50:37] really is. And now Pines is about to
[50:39] just vibe out on a on a little salad
[50:41] over here. We are here at BPI. We
[50:45] consume and we produce, right? And I'm
[50:49] consuming and I'm producing at the exact
[50:50] same time. It's a fish. You know, I can
[50:53] respect that even though he's trying to
[50:55] uh clearly trying to attack the fund.
[50:57] But like the vibe, you know, it's like
[50:59] one of those things. You conquer your
[51:01] enemy by being unlike him. Like that is
[51:04] the greatest revenge, you know? Not that
[51:06] you're my enemy, Matt, but you
[51:10] know. Wait, we still Oh, I'm just making
[51:12] sure we still got you, Sam Bankman
[51:14] Freed. We do. Okay, you're Oh, nope. We
[51:17] lost you now.
[51:19] He must have uh his yard time must have
[51:21] been up. Oh, you're back. Okay. Worried
[51:23] the singularity had collapsed on you.
[51:26] Yeah, sorry. I ran out of phone minutes.
[51:28] Uh so yeah, the
[51:32] tough tough had to trade Pines some
[51:34] cigarettes for some extra minutes, huh?
[51:36] Exactly.
[51:37] Cigarettes. It's really nice of Pines to
[51:40] visit you, you know. I mean, it's very,
[51:42] you know, he's a considerate guy to
[51:43] come. Yeah. When I get out in 30 years,
[51:47] uh we're running Alamita back. Uh, and
[51:50] and this time that Asian like influencer
[51:52] that that visited Sam that Elon wanted
[51:55] to baby you with uh Tiffany Fong.
[51:59] Tiffany Fong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[52:01] So, when I get out in 50 years or 30
[52:03] years, um, we're going to run it back
[52:05] turbo. Um, you know, it and and really,
[52:10] you know, in retrospect, like, you know,
[52:12] I think what happened, um, yeah, I said
[52:14] a lot of things at the trial and on and
[52:16] on Twitter and,
[52:19] uh, you I've had some time to reflect.
[52:22] Um, it was just the vibes. The vibes
[52:25] were just wrong. Um, and I think I
[52:27] think, you know, our failure is is in
[52:29] some ways evidence of the success of
[52:31] this new venture. Um cuz when you start
[52:34] from a fundamentally vibe aligned
[52:37] foundation, uh failure just isn't an
[52:39] option. It's just not even in the sort
[52:41] of portfolio of of possibilities. And
[52:44] you know, to all the the capital
[52:46] allocators that are watching this and
[52:47] and thinking, you know, how large of a
[52:50] check should I write? You know, should I
[52:51] give these people half of my net worth,
[52:54] 80% of my net worth? Should I take out
[52:56] debt and give them 110% of my net worth?
[53:00] I think the fundamental sort of
[53:02] realization you have to come to is
[53:04] there's not another fund in the world
[53:06] that can eliminate the possibility of
[53:08] failure except VCM. So, you know, as as
[53:12] the director of custodial services, you
[53:13] know, you just when you want to invest,
[53:15] you know, you send me the coins and I
[53:17] custody them and and up only, you know,
[53:20] commences.
[53:22] It's ultimately that the that VCM is
[53:24] just it is the way like it is that you
[53:26] know the vibes are the DAO essentially
[53:29] and once you kind of like the vibe that
[53:30] can be spoken is not the vibe right and
[53:33] you you tap into that oneness of the
[53:35] vibe and it's you don't how how can we
[53:38] even describe that oneness to to your
[53:39] point Sam Begmanfrieded you know it's it
[53:42] is the unexplainable but it is the uh
[53:45] the knowable as soon as you stop trying
[53:47] to know it you know I think I think
[53:50] that's the key you can't
[53:52] to grasp it causes it to elude you. You
[53:55] have to receive it. You can't you can't
[53:57] seize it. You must receive it. And
[54:00] that's what we spend our time doing. You
[54:02] know, in a workday, uh you know, uh
[54:05] maybe seven and a half hours of that
[54:07] time is just being in an open state of
[54:10] attunement to the vibes and the other 30
[54:13] minutes is hitting the market buy
[54:15] button.
[54:17] Yeah. It's and it's a proven strategy. I
[54:19] mean the the fund's performance speaks
[54:21] for itself. No exist. That's the other
[54:23] differentiator of our fund is you know
[54:26] people get caught up in the in the in
[54:28] the options right when you have a big
[54:29] green button and a big red button uh you
[54:32] know life gets messy and complicated.
[54:34] You you cho and choices and you know we
[54:38] eliminate choice. Uh we have a a large
[54:41] green button and we press it uh when we
[54:44] feel that the vibe is good and that's
[54:47] it. We've we've we've eliminated all
[54:49] friction, all complexity, all bad vibes.
[54:52] We've reduced investing in capital
[54:54] management to a single act, pressing the
[54:58] buy button. Uh and I, you know, I just
[55:01] just don't see how that how I can't
[55:03] fail. We're not reactive to bad vibes.
[55:06] We're proactive to good vibes. Correct.
[55:09] I mean, even think about the sell
[55:11] button, the red button. Which button has
[55:13] better vibes? The red sell button or the
[55:15] green buy button? It's not that does
[55:18] change depending on your culture. True.
[55:21] Colors are colors are but buy versus
[55:23] sell just just sit with those for a
[55:25] little bit. Do you feel better when you
[55:27] buy something? Do you sell something?
[55:29] Buy because the future you're you're
[55:32] suddenly participating in a better
[55:34] future. When you sell, you're locking in
[55:38] possibilities today. And maybe you know
[55:40] it feels good in that moment, but the
[55:42] future collapses. You've sold it. When
[55:44] you buy something, the future's
[55:46] unlimited.
[55:47] Can you leverage vibes?
[55:50] This is an interesting interesting.
[55:53] There's vibes futures. No.
[55:56] Or we should launch some guys new
[55:58] product. You know, honestly, we could
[55:59] launch some uh poly markets on on vibes.
[56:02] I think that would uh never mind.
[56:05] Actually, it's probably not. Yeah, there
[56:07] is a difficulty, right? you know, as you
[56:08] as you enter the derivatives market of
[56:11] vibes, you do have a quadratic decay in
[56:14] the perceptibility of that vibe. Uh,
[56:17] which is to of course be expected. Now,
[56:19] we've had to utilize some pretty
[56:22] atypical uh market monitoring technology
[56:25] such as the telescopes that are abundant
[56:27] in Hawaii as a point of uh as a point of
[56:30] astral monitoring. We also do some
[56:33] gravitational wave monitoring. But as
[56:35] you can understand that what's really
[56:37] what's really a constraint is actually
[56:39] our greatest asset in the fiat world.
[56:42] You can continue to build uh
[56:44] collateralized obligation onto
[56:46] structured whatever onto batched
[56:49] entranced whatever graded it might be.
[56:52] And this is what has led to this fiat
[56:54] inflation of the market and has led to a
[56:56] lot of confusion in the investing
[56:58] landscape where the individual believes
[57:01] that
[57:03] the 3rd, fourth, fifth, sixth version of
[57:06] the real thing is the real thing. And we
[57:08] are really constrained by the fact that
[57:10] inherent in the vibes themsself is this
[57:14] quadratic decay when you start to enter
[57:16] the derivatives market. So we're getting
[57:18] there. You know, we have the technology.
[57:20] It's expensive to operate and it's taken
[57:22] quite a bit of compute on the back end.
[57:25] But again, it's not our core not our
[57:27] core strategy. That's kind of the icing
[57:28] on the cake as opposed to really the
[57:31] meat that we want to get into. With each
[57:33] derivative, you get further away from
[57:35] the vibe essentially. That's right.
[57:37] That's exactly right. We're very focused
[57:38] on owning that which is real and we're
[57:41] very sensitive buying things which are
[57:44] inherently unreal. But like Rob said,
[57:47] there's some pathways. There's a lot of
[57:49] compute involved. We're one of Nvidia's
[57:51] biggest customers and that's a very
[57:53] competit competitive market right now.
[57:56] Uh we took over a small Bitcoin miner
[57:58] for the power, you know, the power
[58:00] contracts and we've done a, you know, a
[58:02] huge Blackwell deployment. We've really
[58:04] deployed, you know, a ton of GPUs to
[58:07] work on this problem, but it's a hard
[58:09] one. Um, and we're very committed
[58:12] to if we do engage in derivatives
[58:15] activities, those projections from the
[58:19] real need to themselves be real.
[58:23] I mean, syn synthetic vibes are
[58:25] ultimately they're just not the same
[58:26] vibe, you know, and and I think that's
[58:28] the key point.
[58:30] But vibes treasury companies.
[58:34] Yeah. Now, I I knew we were getting
[58:36] there at some point. Um, yeah. Now I do
[58:38] have to say that's the one point of
[58:40] departure where I think you can sort of
[58:42] like Stephen said you can kind of
[58:44] fractal out and away from truth but if
[58:48] you sort of orient that upward fractal
[58:51] uh you can actually compound on truth
[58:53] and accelerate truth wherein each vibes
[58:57] treasury company uh actually commands uh
[59:01] an MVA all right a multiple of the the
[59:05] the Vibe asset value. Um, and I think
[59:09] that's just another way that uh that
[59:12] that VCM is going to outperform. Did you
[59:14] know I mean everyone gets this wrong.
[59:17] They say, you know, MNAV uh you know,
[59:20] and the they they they think it's a like
[59:22] native asset value. It's actually native
[59:24] asset vibes. The V is actually for
[59:26] vibes. That's what an MNAP is. I can see
[59:29] how that would it's been generating
[59:30] clearly a lot of confusion in the
[59:31] marketplace. I feel like the like we
[59:34] really need to get this research out
[59:35] there just to set the record straight
[59:36] and I feel like it'll it'll improve the
[59:38] vibes just generally without this much
[59:41] confusion because preliminary it'sordant
[59:44] and I have sent out a preliminary
[59:46] analysis into the world you know looking
[59:48] at some of the largest assets by market
[59:51] cap in the world right and and I mean
[59:53] look at gold right we have millennia
[59:57] history of humans you know harnessing
[60:01] the vibes from gold like they have both
[60:05] helped civilization adapt but think of
[60:08] all think of the mans think of all the
[60:11] all the well there was negative fives
[60:13] you know to acquire that gold but yet
[60:15] they've also helped humanity you know
[60:17] reach certain levels right store of
[60:20] vibes it's it's the oldest store of
[60:23] vibes so it's going to be at the top for
[60:26] a while now but I mean our our small
[60:29] fund is catching up but you Below gold
[60:32] is obviously Bitcoin. Bitcoin has a lot
[60:34] of vibes. It's number two. It's not
[60:37] number two yet, you know, in the
[60:39] traditional allocation sense, but it's
[60:41] number two based on the strategic vibes
[60:45] assessment. And silver's up there, too,
[60:48] right? Long history. It's just just not
[60:51] the same as
[60:52] gold. And I mean, micro strategy or
[60:55] strategy now. A lot of vibes.
[60:58] lot of I mean Sailor is a strong I would
[61:01] say uh projector of vibes. He's a vibe
[61:04] stacker. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's
[61:06] undeniable there. Um and I have to
[61:08] imagine that behind uh MSTR's Bitcoin
[61:12] treasury strategy is a Vibe Treasury
[61:15] strategy that's just waiting to be
[61:16] announced. Like I feel like that's the
[61:18] ultimate, you know, it's not that MSTR
[61:20] is going to transform into a Bitcoin
[61:22] bank like many are hypothesizing. It's
[61:24] really into a a vibe bank essentially is
[61:27] what they're really going for, but I can
[61:29] see why he would want to keep that
[61:30] quiet. Um perhaps he's not as open as we
[61:33] are at Vibe Capital Management. Being
[61:34] head hunted. Oh, we have to we have to
[61:37] fight him off every day. Sailor is
[61:39] really coming for our people. Uh every
[61:42] day they're sending over, you know,
[61:44] these agents that try to try to get our
[61:46] talent because I mean we have some of
[61:48] the best talent in the industry. I think
[61:49] it's actually the best. People tell me
[61:51] they're the best. Um, and a lot of
[61:53] people are saying it. So many people are
[61:55] saying it. You know, just go on Twitter.
[61:57] Um,
[61:59] but you know, Micro Strategy has been a
[62:02] vibe. That's why it's been so
[62:04] successful. That's why there's so many
[62:06] other Bitcoin treasury companies. That's
[62:08] why uh you know and you know I think
[62:12] Sailor realized that Bitcoin had good
[62:15] vibes and he basically took his company
[62:18] which was struggling with vibes right
[62:20] before Bitcoin. Um there we go. Another
[62:23] vibe shift. It was a vibe shift. He was
[62:26] a kind of in a low vibe point with his
[62:29] software. Nobody really cared about the
[62:31] software. Um, but he realized he can
[62:33] convert all of that potential energy
[62:36] represented by capital on the balance
[62:38] sheet into Bitcoin. And this was a vibe
[62:41] shift. He actually that's what happens
[62:43] actually when you exchange dollars for
[62:46] Bitcoin. You're vibeshifting dollars.
[62:50] That is a vibe shift. And that is why
[62:52] you're actually transforming. Every time
[62:55] you convert a dollar into Bitcoin, you
[62:57] increase the vibe of capital markets
[63:00] because there is more energy in good
[63:03] vibes Bitcoin, less energy in bad vibes,
[63:06] fiat. And so Sailor really kind of
[63:09] leveled up the vibes of Micro Strategy
[63:11] when he embarked on this uh you know
[63:14] this this path. Yeah, corporate strategy
[63:16] upward volatility a vibe.
[63:19] Sorry to cut you off Rob. Yeah, hard it
[63:22] really seems like it that it has a
[63:24] that's a ultimately a positive. It's an
[63:26] up and to the right volatile vibe. But
[63:28] volatility really it's not just health.
[63:31] It it is the vibe, right? You need
[63:33] volatility for if there's no volatility.
[63:35] There's no way for right and it is the
[63:38] fundamental vibe shift that happens
[63:40] internally when you start to gro
[63:42] Bitcoin. You know the the volatility is
[63:44] the greatest fear point for the early
[63:46] adopter. It's the case of that last buy
[63:49] is always the one that you are indexing
[63:51] against which makes you nervous to do
[63:53] the next buy. And really what happens
[63:56] over time if you go through cycles, two
[63:58] cycles, three cycles is that you realize
[64:01] is you've been denominating this game in
[64:05] the wrong way entirely. And once you
[64:07] once you make that shift and once you
[64:09] make the fundamental realization that
[64:11] one bitcoin is one bitcoin 10,000 sats
[64:14] is always 10,000 sats. The volatility
[64:17] was on the other side of the equation.
[64:18] It was in the fiat world. You are you
[64:21] are merely transitioning from this
[64:23] highly volatile fiat world into the most
[64:27] stable vibe that there is. So it's
[64:29] really it's it's a human it's a human
[64:31] experience that you're going through
[64:32] when you are participating in this
[64:35] volatility. And it's that that internal
[64:37] drive vi vibe shift that moves you from
[64:40] the fiat standard that's already
[64:42] resonating. It's the base level code for
[64:44] so many of us having been raised in this
[64:46] fiat ecosystem. And really the best that
[64:48] we can do is make this transition
[64:51] ourselves in the hope that as we have
[64:53] and raise kids in later generations that
[64:57] the volatility is immaterial because
[64:58] they're already on the standard of the
[65:00] vibiest reserve asset of all which is
[65:03] Bitcoin. the new triple bottom line.
[65:06] Volatility, vitality, and vibes. I love
[65:09] it. That's it. Hey, uh there's a truck
[65:13] driver vibing out there that I got to go
[65:15] unload, but uh I'll uh I'll catch y'all
[65:18] I'll catch y'all vibing later. All
[65:19] right, I love it, y'all.
[65:22] Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to have to
[65:23] roll in the Colorado sun as well for you
[65:25] beauties. Okay, please continue these
[65:27] great vibes for hosting, guys. It it was
