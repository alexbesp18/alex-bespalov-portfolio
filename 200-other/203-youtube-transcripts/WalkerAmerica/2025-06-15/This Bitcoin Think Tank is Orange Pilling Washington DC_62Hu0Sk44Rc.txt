[00:00] I low-key think of myself as trying to
[00:02] help heal the public image of Bitcoin
[00:06] because a lot of people, however they
[00:09] first heard about it, I mean, this is
[00:10] just human psychology, but like your
[00:12] first impression tends to be hard to
[00:15] supplant. And so if they thought it was
[00:18] drug money for Silk Road or if they
[00:20] thought that it's money laundering or if
[00:22] they thought that it's like an incel in
[00:25] the basement playing video games, that's
[00:28] probably how they still think about it.
[00:30] And it actually takes a significant
[00:32] rewrite and you know neural pathway
[00:36] reconstruction to say actually it's
[00:39] freedom money. Actually there are a lot
[00:41] of really cool implications. It's like
[00:43] we're day walkers pretending that we're
[00:45] normal. We're we're still not normal,
[00:47] but we at least are normal
[00:51] [Music]
[00:55] passing. Greetings and salutations, my
[00:58] fellow plebs. My name is Walker and this
[01:00] is the Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin
[01:03] continues to create new blocks every 10
[01:06] minutes and the value of one Bitcoin is
[01:08] still one Bitcoin. If you are listening
[01:11] to this right now, remember you are
[01:14] still early. Head to the show notes for
[01:16] sponsor links. Head to
[01:19] substack.com/walkeramea to get episodes
[01:22] emailed to you and head to
[01:24] bitcoinodcast.net for everything else.
[01:27] Without further ado, let's get into this
[01:29] Bitcoin talk.
[01:38] I don't have like my uh the Jamie to my
[01:41] Joe Rogan. Not that I'm comparing myself
[01:43] to Joe Rogan. Um but like what I don't
[01:45] have the uh the Danny to my Peter
[01:48] McCormack, you know? I I I don't have a
[01:51] yet. I you know, I've been honestly
[01:53] thinking I'm like it's like about
[01:55] that point like I kind of like need to
[01:56] hire somebody, but I'm also like ah
[01:59] that's that's like a lot of sats. And I
[02:01] also I wouldn't say I'm a control freak
[02:03] in any way, but like I have like my
[02:05] workflow. I've got every I've got
[02:06] everything like figured out. I do it
[02:08] like pretty damn efficiently uh for like
[02:11] a single person workflow. And I'm like,
[02:12] is somebody else going to mess up that
[02:14] workflow? I don't know. But it's getting
[02:16] to that point where I'm like I I just
[02:18] don't have the time to do everything.
[02:19] So, we'll see. Maybe I'll get my Jamie
[02:22] Danny someday soon. the if if you're
[02:25] looking for some words of wisdom, uh
[02:28] this is this is what I would love to
[02:29] give you as a as a present, as a gift,
[02:31] host gift. Uh someone once told me,
[02:34] you're probably more competent than the
[02:36] people that you would hire to do
[02:38] something. But if you are the only one
[02:42] that is doing anything, you are
[02:43] fundamentally limiting your growth
[02:46] potential and capacity. So as long as
[02:49] you want to continue expanding and
[02:53] growing, it is crucial. You know, trust
[02:55] is a scaling solution. Yeah. And you
[02:58] have to ultimately delegate and trust
[03:01] and equip and empower people to come
[03:03] alongside.
[03:05] Man, that was that's that's really solid
[03:07] advice and I agree. And like that's the
[03:09] thing like I've I've like I've I've
[03:11] known this, you know, where where it's
[03:13] like, okay, if you want to actually grow
[03:15] this in a meaningful way, like you just
[03:16] you don't have the time to do it
[03:18] yourself. Like you need people to do the
[03:19] other stuff so that you can spend more
[03:21] time actually focusing on growing it. Uh
[03:24] but then again, I'm like, well, you
[03:25] know, I'll just I'll do that next month.
[03:26] Like, ah, there's too much going on now.
[03:28] I don't know. Maybe I'll do some head
[03:29] hunting at uh in in Las Vegas and see if
[03:32] I can find somebody. We'll see. They
[03:35] need to be super based, though. But I
[03:37] don't know. Can we find a based
[03:38] Bitcoiner? I don't know. It's tough out
[03:42] there. Uh it's honestly I was
[03:44] commiserating with a friend at Temp's in
[03:47] Austin last week, the Texas Energy and
[03:49] Mining Summit, how there are so few jobs
[03:52] in the Bitcoin space for non-technical,
[03:55] non-dev roles like that. That's just
[03:59] it's it's so rare to be and that's part
[04:02] of I guess segue. I'm so happy and
[04:05] thrilled to be at BPI because of the
[04:08] very few jobs that do exist that aren't
[04:11] on technical, typically they're
[04:13] associated or connected to a product or
[04:16] a service or you know they're they're
[04:19] just they're building versus um I mean
[04:23] we're building but we're building
[04:24] relationships at BPI and connections.
[04:28] Well, and I let's let's just like let's
[04:30] take that thread and just run with it.
[04:32] Can can we start out? Can you both
[04:34] introduce yourselves without doxing, you
[04:37] know, yourselves, but uh who what uh
[04:40] what what Nim should we call you? Who
[04:41] are you? And and maybe like how did how
[04:44] did you both end up at BPI? Cuz I feel
[04:46] like I kind of like you were both doing
[04:47] other things and all of a sudden it was
[04:49] like you were both there at BPI. BPI is
[04:52] doing all sorts of incredible stuff
[04:53] which I want to get into, but like how
[04:55] did you both end up there? What like
[04:56] what drew you to that? I'll I'll jump in
[04:59] first since I I was there slightly
[05:02] premills. Um but very grateful that and
[05:06] feel like a little bit a part of getting
[05:08] to have her. Um you'll get a shout out,
[05:10] don't you worry. I don't think it really
[05:12] was all Mills getting, you know, getting
[05:14] her job, but I was extremely thrilled to
[05:18] have her join the team. Um since she's
[05:20] also been a friend for a little while
[05:21] with in the Bitcoin world, but beyond.
[05:24] Um I last year about a year and a half
[05:28] ago joined BPI for a temporary like just
[05:32] coming on as their kind of single person
[05:36] to help with the summit beyond the
[05:40] three full-time team and like two
[05:43] part-time people. Um actually maybe just
[05:46] one part-time person at that time. So
[05:48] very very small group and I came on and
[05:50] helped do the summit last year and it
[05:52] was awesome. and then about sometime
[05:56] last summer, I started as Grant and
[05:58] David's assistant. Um, and slash also
[06:02] handling events to an extent. Um, as
[06:06] we've like gotten a bigger team,
[06:08] especially a team that's based in DC, I
[06:12] like my role has shifted there, but I've
[06:14] kind of just help where I can. It's
[06:15] really fun. Um, getting to do what I
[06:17] like to do. I was volunteering for doing
[06:21] a Bitcoin related events up until this.
[06:24] So, it's kind of like right up my
[06:26] wheelhouse. Although, this has been a
[06:29] very
[06:30] atypical Bitcoin event world, which is
[06:33] kind of another cool thing. It's like a
[06:35] merging of like the normal people world
[06:39] um with with Bitcoin, if that makes
[06:42] sense. Are are we saying politicians are
[06:44] normal though? Uh cuz no but but
[06:49] different where people like wear suits
[06:53] for example to attend things. Um that
[06:56] was just you know I used not typical
[06:59] Bitcoin conference attire. That's for
[07:01] sure. I used to go to events where
[07:02] people wore like buttondowns and slacks
[07:04] and suits and then I didn't for several
[07:07] years once I got into Bitcoin ever see a
[07:09] suit at a Bitcoin event and now we're
[07:11] back. So it's it's been very cool. the
[07:14] suits came full circle. It was It was
[07:16] only a matter of time before the suits
[07:18] came.
[07:19] We're so back. I I also feel like
[07:22] there's there's the kind of being able
[07:26] like bedside manner, but also the let's
[07:29] say social capital, social graces,
[07:32] social skills that I think there's a
[07:35] spectrum within the Bitcoin space.
[07:37] There's actually a lot of different
[07:38] spectrums within the Bitcoin space. And
[07:42] I think we're we're out here trying to
[07:46] in some ways I I low-key think of myself
[07:49] as trying to help heal the public image
[07:52] of Bitcoin because a lot of people
[07:55] however they first heard about it I mean
[07:57] this is just human psychology but like
[07:59] your first impression tends to be hard
[08:01] to supplant and so if they thought it
[08:05] was drug money for Silk Road or if they
[08:07] thought that it's money laundering or if
[08:09] they thought that it's like an incel in
[08:12] the basement playing video games. That's
[08:15] probably how they still think about it.
[08:17] And it actually takes a significant
[08:19] rewrite and you know neural pathway
[08:23] reconstruction to say actually it's
[08:26] freedom money. Actually there are a lot
[08:28] of really cool implications. But anyway,
[08:31] sorry tangent off of u it's hard to be
[08:35] uh you we have to it's like we're day
[08:37] walkers pretending that we're normal.
[08:39] We're We're still not normal, but we at
[08:41] least are normal passing.
[08:44] We're we're normal presenting. Like we
[08:46] we we you throw a suit you throw a suit
[08:49] on a Bitcoiner and like you kind of
[08:51] forget that they're a little bit of an
[08:53] anarchist. And I mean an anarchist in
[08:55] like the the true sense of the word.
[08:57] Like not in the Hollywood sense of like
[08:59] Mad Max, but in the like anarchist, like
[09:02] from the Greek without rulers, without
[09:04] chiefs. Like that's ultimately what
[09:06] Bitcoiners are, which which is why I
[09:08] find like Bitcoin, the Bitcoin policy
[09:10] institute to be such an interesting
[09:11] thing because it's like a bunch of
[09:13] people who I know and have heard talk
[09:16] about how deeply they like care about
[09:18] Bitcoin and a lot of whom are very,
[09:20] let's say, anti-state or anti-state
[09:23] control, anti-entralized authority.
[09:25] That's why they're into Bitcoin. And yet
[09:29] you're actively I mean it's it's a it's
[09:31] a think tank technically, right? That's
[09:33] like what the That's the DC jargon for
[09:36] it. Like it's a think tank, right?
[09:37] That's what we are. Okay, maybe let's
[09:40] let's like start there. Like what So
[09:42] like what does a think tank do? Like is
[09:45] it is just like a lot of just a lot of
[09:47] people pondering at at any given time.
[09:49] Right there in the name. Yeah. Yeah. But
[09:52] we sit in a war tank while we do it.
[09:55] Okay. Okay. Okay. Like maybe like Okay.
[09:59] So jokes aside, like what what do you
[10:02] what do you view as like what is the
[10:04] goal of BPI? Like what what what do you
[10:07] hope to accomplish? Cuz like I think a a
[10:10] lot of people have now seen the
[10:11] different summits that have been put on
[10:13] like big names at these things.
[10:15] Obviously um Senator Cynthia Lumis has
[10:18] been very prominent at them. She's a
[10:20] kind of a staple at many Bitcoin events
[10:22] now. Um and from the multiple times I've
[10:24] met her seems like legitimately an
[10:26] incredibly decent person. um and like
[10:30] very uh not the kind of politician that
[10:33] you typically see around DC, but like do
[10:37] you hope to kind of create more or bring
[10:39] more people in that are like Cynthia
[10:40] Lumus? Do those people already exist? Is
[10:42] it about persuading other people just
[10:44] not to like try to stomp Bitcoin out?
[10:46] What What do you What's the goal?
[10:50] Well, I'll I'll give my how I got to BPI
[10:54] story to the goal. So, it it's the
[10:58] perfect setup. Um, I've been in the
[11:00] Bitcoin space professionally for about 5
[11:03] years and more on the media side, more
[11:05] on the storytelling side, both with
[11:08] Bitcoin Magazine and Thank God for
[11:11] Bitcoin and Pub Key. And honestly, this
[11:15] is where Mads gets the shout out. I had
[11:18] been traveling last year. I kind of took
[11:20] a sabatical mostly off of Bitcoin, off
[11:24] of Twitter, off of everything. and
[11:27] traveled went to all 50 states in one
[11:29] year, which was crazy. It was a really
[11:32] crazy thing. I didn't actually start out
[11:34] the year planning to do that. It it kind
[11:36] of by Thanksgiving, I decided that I
[11:39] should just full send cuz I still had
[11:41] Alaska. That was the tough one to to
[11:43] get. But on my travels, I swung through
[11:48] and was able to go on a walk with Mads
[11:51] and grab a coffee. And that was I think
[11:55] the first time I knew that BPI was going
[11:57] to be hiring. And I knew I've known
[12:02] David and Grant, the co-presidents of
[12:04] BPI. I've known them since before BPI
[12:07] existed. And when I was at Bitcoin
[12:09] Magazine, they would just be like in one
[12:12] of our conference rooms writing on the
[12:13] whiteboard like memeing this into
[12:16] existence like, "What if we do this?"
[12:18] And you know, we would say things like,
[12:20] "Oh, you're making a super PAC." or oh
[12:22] you're lobbyists or you know we were we
[12:23] were joke it was very playful um at the
[12:26] time and over the years yeah the the
[12:29] summit um this is going to be our third
[12:32] annual summit but the summit began to be
[12:35] a thing that was a very important you
[12:37] know in the portfolio of BPI but the
[12:41] goal of Bitcoin policy institute and I
[12:44] think this is
[12:45] where I like I'm super happy to be here
[12:48] and I know most of my friends are like
[12:51] that's cool. I know why you're doing
[12:53] that. There are some Bitcoiners that are
[12:56] probably
[12:57] similarly politically and ideologically
[13:00] viewing the world as I am, but they will
[13:04] have kind of a reaction like why would I
[13:08] even care? Why does it even matter? Why
[13:10] is it important? And I think there's
[13:13] like that brings us to the goal which
[13:18] ultimately it is relationships and
[13:21] Cynthia Lemus like yeah has become kind
[13:23] of the the Bitcoiner people's senator um
[13:28] because she is talking about it and the
[13:32] re reality of right now is there is a
[13:36] vast chasm and void of education and
[13:39] understanding about Bitcoin. So I think
[13:43] like tagline snappy BPI exists to
[13:47] demystify Bitcoin to a lot of people and
[13:51] I think the if it if we don't have these
[13:54] foundational relationships with Congress
[13:57] and executive and regulatory like we
[14:00] want them we want BPI to be the go-to
[14:03] source for any government official if
[14:05] they have a question about Bitcoin
[14:07] because like it or not there will be
[14:11] legislation creat created. There will be
[14:13] laws and and sanctions and there will be
[14:16] control that will be written and that
[14:18] will be passed and that will exist and
[14:21] it will impact everyone. So yeah, you
[14:24] can head in the sand and you can say
[14:27] like oh you know DC is the swamp or what
[14:31] you can say whatever you want and and
[14:33] there is a truth in that. You have to I
[14:36] think the point being like go to where
[14:39] the decisions are being made to
[14:41] influence that through education and
[14:44] awareness and also like
[14:47] raising the profile of Bitcoin to say,
[14:52] "Hey, we're we're a nonprofit. We're a
[14:55] 501c3 fully dedicated and focused on
[14:59] helping like the case, make the case
[15:02] that Bitcoin advances American interest
[15:05] and also influence and and inform people
[15:08] to be able to craft policy that helps
[15:10] Bitcoin grow and that protects American
[15:13] Bitcoiners and companies. And I think
[15:15] there is there is a value, there is an
[15:18] importance. Obviously, I'm passionate
[15:20] enough about it. And I think that's
[15:22] where after working in the space and
[15:24] then taking this year off, there were
[15:26] not a lot of things that I thought were
[15:27] worthwhile doing with my time. And I
[15:29] wanted a job that I felt like I could
[15:31] put my weight behind and be very
[15:34] passionate and know it mattered. And it
[15:37] is such a really preient time to be
[15:40] working in this space because the
[15:41] administration is so open and so
[15:43] friendly. This is we got to do it right
[15:46] because it's so much easier to make good
[15:49] law, good policy, then fix what gets
[15:53] written and is broken and breaking and
[15:55] we're feeling the impact of it. Sorry,
[15:57] long rant. Thank you so much for
[15:59] listening. No, like I said, it's this is
[16:00] always a safe space for uh for rants. I
[16:03] mean, I first of all, Matt, is there
[16:05] anything you wanted to add on top of
[16:06] that? And then I've got just kind of
[16:07] like a follow-up. At risk of basically
[16:09] restating less eloquently what Mills
[16:12] just said, I'll throw my two cents in. I
[16:14] agree. I have a lot of people I run a
[16:17] meetup and a lot of like times people
[16:20] come up and they are very kind of anti
[16:23] even being associated with the political
[16:26] world. And I my my response is you know
[16:30] I I live in America. I do love my
[16:32] country and I don't have the resources
[16:35] or the want to flee the country if if
[16:39] things get oppressive. So, ideally, I'm
[16:41] going to want the best laws, the best,
[16:45] you know, like
[16:47] legislator, sorry, legislature for um
[16:52] for Bitcoin because I'm pro Bitcoin
[16:54] also. So it it's kind of yeah it's it's
[16:57] like kind of working in the weeds but
[16:59] you're and and some people I don't think
[17:02] necessarily even have that same tendency
[17:05] to like be slightly against the
[17:08] political world that Mills and I might
[17:10] have but um but you know that that are
[17:14] associated with Bitcoin they may just be
[17:16] all pro Bitcoin policy which is great
[17:20] and I think that there's definitely a
[17:21] balance but um yeah I just want it to
[17:25] the place I live. I want companies,
[17:27] Bitcoin companies to be friendly to them
[17:30] and that like so there'll be more
[17:32] Bitcoin businesses. So yeah,
[17:34] I'm similar to what Mills said, just I
[17:37] think it's in in our circumstances, it's
[17:40] kind of the best option. Why not try to,
[17:43] you know, if there's someone that's
[17:45] friendly like has an an ear out to us,
[17:48] why not try to push for the best Bitcoin
[17:50] policy we can get? If you're stuck
[17:53] spending dollars, at least stop earning
[17:56] dirty fiat rewards. Use Fold to earn
[17:59] Bitcoin on everyday purchases and
[18:01] regular expenses, groceries, bills,
[18:04] travel, home improvement. I literally
[18:06] just earned
[18:07] 2,23 sats. Buying a $100 Amazon gift
[18:11] card on Fold. You don't even need to use
[18:14] the Fold card itself if you don't want
[18:16] to. You can connect your favorite credit
[18:18] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[18:20] on merchant offers or go allin. Make
[18:24] Fold the center of your personal
[18:26] finances. Buy, earn, save, and even get
[18:30] paid in Bitcoin with Fold. Head to the
[18:32] link in the show notes to get started
[18:34] with the ultimate savings toolkit. Or go
[18:37] directly to
[18:38] [Music]
[18:41] use.foldapp.com/r/walker and get
[18:43] yourself $10 in Bitcoin when you sign
[18:45] up. If you've accepted that we're living
[18:48] through the fourth turning, then it's
[18:49] time to get yourself some Bitcoin and
[18:52] then go to
[18:54] bitbox.swiss/walker and use the promo
[18:56] code Walker for 5% off the easy to use,
[18:59] fully open-source Bitcoin only Bitbox 2
[19:02] hardware wallet. Then get your Bitcoin
[19:04] off the exchange into your own
[19:05] self-custody and prepare yourself for
[19:07] the chaos that is to come. The world is
[19:10] going pretty wild right now, but Bitcoin
[19:12] is ripping and your stack will soon be
[19:14] worth a heck of a lot more in fiat value
[19:16] than it is today as every currency
[19:18] around the world hyperinflates. So now
[19:20] is the perfect time to get your security
[19:22] locked down tight with Bitbox. I really
[19:24] want to emphasize that the Bitbox O2 is
[19:26] easy as hell to use. Whether you're
[19:27] brand new to Bitcoin, it's your first
[19:29] time setting up a hardware wallet, or
[19:30] you are a well seasoned psychopath. It
[19:32] is Bitcoin only and fully open source.
[19:35] No need to trust me. You can head to
[19:37] their GitHub and verify that for
[19:39] yourself when you go to
[19:42] bitbox.swiss/walker and use the promo
[19:43] code Walker. Not only do you get 5% off,
[19:46] but you also help support this podcast.
[19:49] So, thank you. I I think it's an
[19:51] interesting thing because, you know, I
[19:53] haven't been in Bitcoin that long. I
[19:55] mean, I guess it's starting to get feel
[19:57] like a long time, but like I didn't
[19:59] start like stacking really until like
[20:02] like partway through 2020. Like it
[20:05] wasn't until like co really after having
[20:07] ignored it like I I I've ignored Bitcoin
[20:10] for much longer than I've been uh you
[20:12] know paying attention to Bitcoin. But
[20:14] like even in that time, what I've been
[20:17] able to see is like Bitcoiners are
[20:19] really good at having something to push
[20:21] against, like something to fight
[20:22] against, something to like just rail
[20:25] against, something that you feel like
[20:27] you need like a common enemy, you know,
[20:29] and it's very easy when that enemy is
[20:32] like the government, when that enemy is
[20:34] the lawmakers who are, you know, like
[20:36] the when if everybody's an Elizabeth
[20:38] Warren, like it's really easy to be like
[20:40] that's who we are fighting against
[20:42] these, you know, tyrannical ical wouldbe
[20:45] commie dictators who want to absolutely
[20:47] strip away any semblance of freedom that
[20:49] you have. When you start seeing
[20:51] politicians like actually come around to
[20:53] this, it gets to be like a little bit of
[20:55] a weird thing cuz you're like, "All
[20:57] right, well, they're they're saying the
[20:59] same things we're saying. Are they on
[21:01] like our side now? Are we on the same
[21:03] team? Do we do we actually want the same
[21:05] thing? Are they just paying us lip
[21:06] service because they want our votes and
[21:08] our donations?" Like, it gets to be a
[21:10] little bit of a muddier area. And I
[21:13] think that's where Bitcoiners, myself
[21:14] included, start to get a little bit like
[21:16] wary of some of these things. But it's
[21:18] like it's in many ways it's a like same
[21:22] with a a national strategic
[21:25] reserve. It's a natural consequence of
[21:27] Bitcoin succeeding, right? Like this is
[21:30] what winning looks like. If Bitcoin is
[21:33] successful and was going to be
[21:35] successful, politicians getting on board
[21:38] was always going to happen. Whether or
[21:41] not you like that or not, that's beside
[21:42] the point. It's just like this is a
[21:44] natural consequence. This is how things
[21:46] were going to go down. And so, you know,
[21:48] it's uh I'm I'm in agreement with with
[21:51] you uh with you, Mads, that it's like,
[21:53] okay, I live in America. I love America.
[21:56] Uh like I America has afforded me many
[21:58] privileges that the majority of people
[22:00] in the world do not have. For that, I am
[22:03] very grateful. I you can love America
[22:06] without being a s for the government,
[22:09] right? those two things like that they
[22:11] don't have to go hand inand and I think
[22:12] a lot of people kind of miss that. Uh
[22:14] but like ultimately America is an idea
[22:17] and I think that that's like fighting
[22:19] like Bitcoin is a very not that Bitcoin
[22:21] is American but the idea of Bitcoin is
[22:24] consistent with American values, right?
[22:26] Like and I think that's something that's
[22:28] worth fighting for. And I'm I'm kind of
[22:30] curious just do you do you feel that
[22:33] just kind of being in the belly of the
[22:35] beast there working for a a DC think
[22:38] tank how how how have you felt the vibe
[22:40] shift to be like clearly there's a big
[22:42] difference between this administration
[22:44] the prior one how much followthrough
[22:46] this administration will have in the
[22:47] long run let's see but like there's been
[22:49] there is no denying that there's been a
[22:51] massive vibe shift how do you guys see
[22:54] that kind of from the inside what's your
[22:55] feeling on it you know still very
[22:57] positive do you think things are still
[22:59] heading in the right direction. How do
[23:00] you see this going down?
[23:02] Go I'll throw in a little bit, but um I
[23:05] will say that I'm not in the office, so
[23:07] I have a ton of FOMO because the DC
[23:10] office there's just a lot happening
[23:12] every day is is what I get from being
[23:15] afar is that there's just like something
[23:17] new and wild kind of crazy huge
[23:19] happening all the time. Uh they're
[23:21] definitely frustrating setbacks, but the
[23:24] change from November on in the like
[23:28] people coming to BPI, reaching out to
[23:31] BPI versus BBI reaching out, you know,
[23:34] to try to make get discussions going
[23:37] else like with others was a huge shift.
[23:40] um the interest that we started getting
[23:43] I think definitely went along with the
[23:46] administr I mean we've been working very
[23:49] hard and had a lot of good support like
[23:53] the last few years but it it definitely
[23:56] changed when the administration change
[23:58] was coming um and so yeah I agree I
[24:02] don't know
[24:04] how like longlasting and you know
[24:08] hardened some of the changes will be
[24:10] will be that are thrown out and talked
[24:12] about. But overall, I think it's it's
[24:16] pretty exciting. It seems like stuff's
[24:18] definitely happening um all the time.
[24:20] So, I'll throw to Mills for more. What's
[24:23] on the ground? Yeah. H on the ground.
[24:25] So, I relocated to DC um inauguration
[24:29] weekend actually. Literally drove into
[24:32] DC like an hour before the crypto ball.
[24:36] like it was uh you know just dive right
[24:39] in go into the deep end. Um so a lot
[24:44] of I mean I would say the biggest thing
[24:47] is there is an openness to discussing
[24:52] that I don't think has ever been the
[24:55] case. Whereas it's almost and this is
[24:58] the analogy I came up with last week at
[25:00] temps. It feels like Bitcoin kind of
[25:02] used to be the fruitfly ornat just like
[25:05] buzzing around but really easy to swat
[25:07] it away and disregard and all of a
[25:10] sudden it's like we're a mosquito that
[25:12] might have malaria and there's like oh
[25:16] we're going to there is a little buzzy
[25:19] thing. Okay. All right. What do you want
[25:21] to say? What do you want to talk about?
[25:23] Okay. We'll hear you out. And there is a
[25:26] little bit of fear. there is a little
[25:28] bit of the like oh we got to catch up we
[25:32] gotta we got to find out what this is
[25:34] about but I think because of the shift
[25:37] in the
[25:38] leadership there is a clear distinction
[25:42] that there is something here and it
[25:46] would behoove politicians to at least
[25:49] have some fundamental understanding and
[25:53] there is that momentum I think that is
[25:56] the big vibe
[25:58] shift of the curiosity and the openness
[26:00] and a lot of what BPI does, you know, on
[26:04] on the ground. Like there's research,
[26:06] but there's also just a lot of reaching
[26:08] out and building relationships. And it's
[26:11] been surprising how easily easily won
[26:15] over or won some of the relationships
[26:18] are that it's it's usually like a
[26:20] 10-minute meeting, super fast. these
[26:22] these elected officials have super
[26:24] jam-packed schedules, but usually we've
[26:27] been met with Yeah. And then the
[26:31] sometimes that 10 minutes runs over and
[26:33] it's 45 minutes because they're so
[26:35] interested or because they're so open to
[26:38] and that that's a specific time from um
[26:41] Begitch, Nick Beg, who spoke at Bitcoin
[26:43] for America and will be speaking at our
[26:45] summit in June. But it was it was really
[26:48] a 10-minute meeting, but they were just
[26:50] like having such a blast talking and
[26:53] apparently he's a huge fan of Matt
[26:54] Pines's. So nice. It was just this like
[26:57] nerding out talking about Bitcoin and
[27:00] UAP like, you know, best case scenario.
[27:02] But those stories keep accumulating of
[27:06] we're reaching out, we're we're knocking
[27:08] on doors, we're having meetings, and
[27:11] basically there is the willingness that
[27:14] I don't know up until this point has
[27:16] ever existed. So this is kind of the
[27:19] harvest is is ripe and ready and there's
[27:22] so much that could be done at this
[27:24] point.
[27:26] I mean, it it's it's cool to see that
[27:28] shift and I can imagine that there's a
[27:30] bit of a scrambling going on by some who
[27:33] have maybe thought I'm just going to
[27:36] ignore Bitcoin. Like like I mean the the
[27:38] malariainfested mosquito is a hilarious
[27:41] analogy, but you know, like for a while
[27:43] like yeah, that's that is a good
[27:45] analogy. Like you you could just kind of
[27:47] safely ignore it. Um you know, maybe us
[27:49] Bitcoiners would say you really
[27:51] shouldn't, but like from a politician's
[27:52] perspective, it's like you guys don't
[27:54] matter. you're inconsequential. It's
[27:56] clear that's no longer the case. It's
[27:58] clear that the the Bitcoin lobby or you
[28:02] know uh I hate to say the larger crypto
[28:04] lobby, but we know that those big crypto
[28:06] companies throw around a ton of money,
[28:09] people are paying attention. They pay
[28:11] attention to where donations come from.
[28:13] They pay attention to who has a massive
[28:15] online presence of really really vocal
[28:18] people who are also happen to be great
[28:21] at memeing which is you know quite a
[28:23] powerful uh alliance to have on your
[28:26] side. So I mean does this is is where
[28:29] we're at right now you think just like
[28:30] kind of a a mad dash towards education
[28:33] like are that's like that's what I'm
[28:35] hearing like there's a realization that
[28:37] okay I need to get smart about this
[28:39] can't ignore it anymore. What what is
[28:41] actually going on here? Have you been
[28:43] like you've talked about some of like
[28:45] the receptiveness. Do you see like I'm
[28:47] assuming you though you still have a lot
[28:48] of meetings that maybe don't go so great
[28:51] or like is there still a lot of push
[28:53] back? Has has BPI tried to approach like
[28:55] Elizabeth Warren for example or is she
[28:57] too far gone?
[28:59] I can't speak to that.
[29:03] Um I'll just speak for that. We are open
[29:06] to that discussion. Um
[29:08] it I don't know that it I'm not aware of
[29:10] it having happened or anything. So
[29:12] that's that's all I'll say. But yeah, I
[29:15] think we want anyone that will discuss
[29:18] it with us. We don't we don't want it to
[29:21] be where like we're just talking to one
[29:23] side of the aisle here because that
[29:24] there are definite reasons for um people
[29:28] on both sides of the aisle to be behind
[29:30] Bitcoin and supportive of it. I mean,
[29:32] it's yeah, to me it's just a no-brainer
[29:35] for anyone, but I, you know, that's
[29:37] that's coming from someone that has
[29:39] been very deeply obsessed with Bitcoin
[29:42] for a while. So, I you know, I don't
[29:44] know. But we I think there's definitely
[29:48] a mix. There are definitely people
[29:49] wanting that education and then there's
[29:50] like there are different levels there.
[29:52] there staffers that are really
[29:53] interested like someone on a you know
[29:56] politician staff is super interested and
[29:59] that kind of gets the ball rolling
[30:02] or you know sometimes there are people
[30:04] that my sense is and this is again just
[30:07] my sense I'm not having these political
[30:09] meetings um to be clear is that maybe
[30:13] they are wanting to get involved because
[30:16] they can sense the momentum around it
[30:19] they may not be there to like understand
[30:21] it yet um are really they're very
[30:24] politicians seem they're very busy and
[30:26] they have
[30:27] like this such a small like like it's
[30:30] like trying to like stick your hand
[30:32] through a closing door, you know, like
[30:33] that kind to like get through to
[30:35] actually have stuff land. They're
[30:38] they're not saying they're not smart,
[30:40] but they just don't have enough time in
[30:41] the day to take on everyone's issues
[30:43] that are coming to them. So, um, some
[30:45] people maybe aren't as like there
[30:48] definitely some like baggage that, um,
[30:50] was talking about that are actually
[30:52] they're like, "Wow, they get it." You
[30:54] know, we're excited about that. And
[30:56] there are others that get that it's a
[30:58] big deal and I think want to want to be
[31:01] involved and be associated with it just
[31:04] because they know that the there's a
[31:06] movement.
[31:08] And I would say like if you had to
[31:10] really boil down BPI's
[31:13] you know the the not the threshold but
[31:16] like the two main focuses of yes
[31:20] education but it's persuading people who
[31:23] are undecided about Bitcoin and then
[31:27] legitimizing the pro Bitcoin
[31:30] stances with those in power who agree
[31:33] with us. So we're not necessarily
[31:35] focusing our energy and time on the like
[31:38] they don't know anything um they're
[31:41] against it. We'll spend some time and
[31:43] we're not against it, but I think most
[31:45] of our time and efforts is focused on
[31:47] these people that are undecided that are
[31:49] kind of curious or open or have some
[31:53] angle that it would make a lot of sense.
[31:55] And we can kind of say how that would
[31:58] make sense within their platforms or
[32:00] policies or or what they're what
[32:02] they're, you know, working on in their
[32:04] elected, you know, capacity. I mean, it
[32:07] makes sense. You want to target like the
[32:08] highest value targets that are going to
[32:11] require the least amount of convincing
[32:13] to like realize, hey, this is why you
[32:15] should be paying attention to this. This
[32:17] is why this is not just good for you,
[32:19] but like this is good for your
[32:20] constituents. This is good for America.
[32:22] Like that's the wild thing is that like
[32:25] any American politician that is actually
[32:27] pro America should love Bitcoin because
[32:30] like if you like freedom, if you like
[32:33] the idea of a small government that is
[32:36] decentralized that you know the federal
[32:37] government is way too freaking big. I
[32:40] think we can all agree with that. I
[32:42] don't know if a lot of politicians
[32:43] would, but it's a fact. Like our
[32:45] founding fathers would be rolling over
[32:47] and vomiting uncontrollably in their
[32:49] graves if they could see how large our
[32:51] federal government has gotten. But like
[32:54] Bitcoin is ultimately extremely pro
[32:56] America. Like it's because it's
[32:58] pro-American people. It gives power to
[32:59] American people. Like if you're against
[33:01] that, you're just kind of outing
[33:03] yourself as being anti-American. That's
[33:05] just what I think. Elizabeth Warren. Um,
[33:07] but anyway, not to not to spend too much
[33:09] time on on old Liz, but so with these
[33:14] with these summits that you guys put
[33:15] together, like is that are you is there
[33:18] like an open invite to basically like
[33:20] any any politician to be like you can
[33:22] you just have your team reach out, you
[33:24] can come or do you guys again target it
[33:26] to those like higher val or not higher
[33:28] value like higher potential people, the
[33:30] people that are already closer to being
[33:32] one over to the orange side? Both. Okay.
[33:36] basically. So, anyone that's a
[33:39] government employee, we're like, come to
[33:42] our summit, anyone. Um, but as far as
[33:45] elected officials, yeah, we we actually
[33:48] spend a lot of time, we're trying to
[33:50] have it balanced and it for it to not
[33:51] just be Republicans that are speaking
[33:54] about it. And we had at BFA, we had
[33:57] Roana and And I feel like it's harder to
[34:00] find Democrats that are interested and
[34:04] that want to talk about it, but are
[34:05] we're actively trying to kind of keep it
[34:09] open. There isn't um there isn't the
[34:12] threshold or barrier to entry on that
[34:14] point, but we are actively seeking out.
[34:17] So, it's both. We're we're open to
[34:19] anyone. Join the conversation. uh
[34:22] educated understand and I think the big
[34:26] thing probably is can at this juncture
[34:29] we're still really trying to make sure
[34:31] there's a clear distinction between what
[34:33] it Bitcoin and crypto and digital assets
[34:37] and I think having that delineation and
[34:41] saying like we're Bitcoin policy
[34:43] institute is Bitcoin first all of our
[34:45] time and energy we're we're all focused
[34:49] on Bitcoin so that's the language
[34:51] language we use, but it should it's
[34:54] important that we kind of continue that
[34:56] education because we believe Bitcoin
[34:58] should be treated uniquely and not just
[35:01] the same as all of the other
[35:03] cryptocurrencies and digital assets. And
[35:06] we did see uh one of the things that I
[35:09] was very pleased to see in the Trump
[35:12] executive order uh around the uh Bitcoin
[35:15] strategic reserve. This is coming after,
[35:18] of course, his like couple of posts on
[35:20] Truth Social where I heard there was
[35:21] some weird stuff with like an XRP lawyer
[35:24] guy who like got in and managed to
[35:26] convince Trump that he should put out
[35:27] this, you know, a tweet on Truth Social
[35:30] that included XRP and then like
[35:32] afterwards he felt like very I don't I
[35:34] don't know if this was just this is
[35:35] hearsay, but that that he felt like, you
[35:37] know, kind of like, you know, fool me
[35:38] once, you're you're fired basically. And
[35:41] uh that person is now Persona Nrada. Uh
[35:44] I don't know if that's actually the
[35:45] case, but this is what I heard. But
[35:48] after that initial uh little debacle,
[35:51] the actual language of the Bitcoin
[35:53] strategic reserve bill very clearly made
[35:56] a delineation between Bitcoin and
[35:59] crypto. Like and I know that like a lot
[36:02] of that language from what I saw uh BPI
[36:05] fellows posting is consistent with a lot
[36:07] of the materials that BPI has been
[36:09] producing, right? Like can you talk
[36:11] about that a little bit and maybe just
[36:13] like what that was kind of like to see
[36:15] that cuz that must have been a pretty
[36:16] nice like pretty nice like win for you
[36:19] guys to see that kind of like stuff like
[36:21] this is a this is a huge deal. This is
[36:23] an executive order like this is uh you
[36:26] know a game changer in terms of the
[36:28] stance toward Bitcoin.
[36:31] Yeah. It's the one time when you're kind
[36:32] of excited about being plagiarized or
[36:36] having someone like cheat off your work.
[36:38] Um, yeah, some of the language
[36:40] from like BPI's white paper was, you
[36:44] know, it just so happened to be also in
[36:47] the executive order, which is it's
[36:50] pretty significant and it's pretty
[36:52] encouraging that we're making an impact
[36:55] and that we do have, you know, the ears
[36:58] or at least like making inroads to
[37:01] having ears as this the SPR, the
[37:04] strategic Bitcoin reserve is such a it
[37:07] was such a focus initially and then now
[37:11] not that it's not still a focus and a
[37:13] priority but you know now there's new
[37:15] things new things that are happening and
[37:17] it's kind of hopeful that we can
[37:20] continue to grow our ability to platform
[37:25] good policy like at the end of the day
[37:28] the point of BPI is to be able to
[37:32] provide the the structure with a deeper
[37:35] understanding cuz we know realistically
[37:37] politicians aren't going to become
[37:39] experts in Bitcoin most likely. And so
[37:42] we want to stand in the gap and be able
[37:44] to say, "Hey, we're actually trying to
[37:46] do this research so you can copy our
[37:49] work because we we're thinking about
[37:51] this with a deep understanding of
[37:53] Bitcoin and how long term this would
[37:55] play out." And I think that is we're at
[37:59] the beginning, but I think we have more
[38:01] momentum than ever. And it feels feels
[38:04] really exciting of what of what is to
[38:07] come.
[38:10] Matt, do you have anything on top of
[38:11] that? I mean, no, other than Yeah, that
[38:14] was a roller coaster of a week that the
[38:17] truth social post and with XRP and then
[38:22] then like the actual executive order
[38:25] coming out and the like Bitcoin kind of
[38:28] being singled out. I mean the it was you
[38:31] know and we had an event the next week
[38:33] in DC um that was focused on getting
[38:38] that either you know getting the bill or
[38:40] an executive order at the time when we
[38:42] were starting to plan like the goal was
[38:44] to rally to get like executive order and
[38:47] bill and then it's like we got the
[38:49] executive order right before the the
[38:52] event. So, um, it was kind of a crazy
[38:55] crazy fun wild time, which is feels like
[38:58] how it's been the whole time at BPI. The
[39:01] stuff just things just keep happening.
[39:04] Um, and I think that's that like you can
[39:06] just do stuff thing, you know, like
[39:09] that's what's what's going on. And it
[39:11] it's it's crazy to see it as just doing
[39:15] stuff and then things happening um on
[39:18] like a really high like you know on a
[39:21] national level or something when we're
[39:23] we're just kind of a little bit mindb
[39:24] blown. We're pretty small group and um
[39:28] yeah it's it's awesome. It's like you
[39:31] can just do things. You can just start a
[39:33] think tank and influence an executive
[39:36] order written by the president of the
[39:37] most powerful nation in the world. like
[39:39] you can just do that like which is wild
[39:41] and like maybe just very quickly for
[39:43] anybody who's who hasn't actually read
[39:45] the text of that executive order I read
[39:47] it for you so you can just go listen on
[39:48] this show you're welcome but also like
[39:50] the the key thing that was cool to see
[39:52] and again this is not me saying yes I
[39:54] want the US government to buy as much
[39:56] Bitcoin as uh they can just to clarify
[39:59] not saying that at all this is a natural
[40:01] again a natural progression this was
[40:03] always going to happen if Bitcoin was
[40:04] winning want to put that caveat in there
[40:07] but they basically said, "Okay, Bitcoin
[40:09] and crypto are different. We are going
[40:12] to create strategic stockpiles of each.
[40:15] We will not dispose of any of the
[40:17] Bitcoin. We will potentially acquire
[40:18] more. We will not acquire any more of
[40:21] the crypto, but we will potentially
[40:23] dispose of it." So, literally like two
[40:25] polar opposites in terms of the
[40:27] treatment. That was what I thought was
[40:29] like great to see because then that's
[40:32] just again one more piece of information
[40:35] that's helping even just the average
[40:37] person see there's a difference between
[40:39] these two because like obviously there's
[40:42] still like not you know most politicians
[40:45] don't understand Bitcoin. Most people
[40:46] don't understand Bitcoin and most people
[40:48] still think that Bitcoin and crypto are
[40:50] like one and the same thing and like Sam
[40:52] Bankman Freed created this Bitcoin token
[40:55] thing and like like the education like
[40:57] is still so important. That's why we
[40:58] always need more Bitcoin podcasts. But I
[41:01] digress. Can you guys talk a little bit
[41:03] about the uh the summit that you have
[41:05] coming up here uh in what about a about
[41:08] a month or so?
[41:10] Yeah. Yeah. What's so what's Yeah. Talk
[41:12] about that. What's the what's the theme
[41:14] of this one? What's the goal? Uh when
[41:17] when is it h June 25th, right? Am I
[41:20] correct on that? Okay. What's happening?
[41:22] Who's going to be there? Uh can anybody
[41:25] come and check this out? What's the
[41:26] deal?
[41:30] Matt's um well, this is our third one
[41:33] and we've we've like grown in size. I I
[41:36] was a part of the second um Bitcoin
[41:39] Policy Summit, so we're growing in size
[41:42] again um for our third one. And it's I
[41:46] mean I think it's going to be awesome.
[41:47] There's going to be I think Mel's I'll
[41:51] let Mills discuss more on like the
[41:52] programming side of of it because she's
[41:55] more involved there. But um we would we
[41:58] want everyone to come. It's going to be
[42:00] great. And there are more because we
[42:03] have a larger team now. We have a few
[42:04] like more external events going on um or
[42:09] satellite. I don't know the right word
[42:11] for that. But yeah, we've got a party
[42:13] the night before um like a cocktail
[42:15] party, welcome party the night before
[42:17] the summit and then the you have an
[42:19] option to get a ticket for our day on
[42:22] the hill which is going to be something
[42:25] really unique this year where we have
[42:28] people on our team that are setting up a
[42:29] whole day where they're lining up
[42:31] appointments with politicians on the
[42:34] hill and you go and you get to meet with
[42:36] them and discuss Bitcoin and there's
[42:38] also some training as to how to speak to
[42:42] the congressman. So there you
[42:44] actually you know what they need to what
[42:47] they're going to take in in a short
[42:49] meeting and like how to get your points
[42:51] across. Um so it's going to be really
[42:54] cool and it's um at the Ronald Reagan
[42:58] building and international trade center
[42:59] which is right kind of between the White
[43:03] House and the Capitol like just off the
[43:06] National Mall. Um, as someone that is
[43:09] not from that area, being able to have
[43:13] gone up to DC a few times now for work,
[43:16] it's been really cool. It's kind of like
[43:17] come my my what I'd say to people not in
[43:21] DC is like come check it out and do like
[43:23] a little history tour while you're
[43:26] there. It's it's really cool to me to
[43:28] come to DC, you know, in like the last
[43:29] few years and see it. I think I'd been
[43:32] once when I was younger, but really like
[43:34] taken in and um yeah, there's a good
[43:37] energy in DC right now. It feels overall
[43:41] positive, I think. Um when I've been up
[43:43] there, like I've had a really nice time.
[43:45] So, yeah, I think it's going to be it's
[43:47] going to be really cool this year to
[43:48] have like an aspect where we get to go
[43:51] and actually talk
[43:53] to lawmakers and push Bitcoin.
[43:58] Can you talk at all about uh or I don't
[44:00] know if you're allowed to disclose but
[44:02] any of the folks that may be coming like
[44:04] are we going to see some familiar faces,
[44:06] some new faces? Are there surprise
[44:08] guests? Uh how how does how does this
[44:11] all work?
[44:13] All of the above. Um we have announced
[44:18] some speakers. I think Mads has the list
[44:20] at the ready. Um she can rattle off some
[44:23] of those. I I told her I'm like I'm I'm
[44:26] living a little too much in the
[44:27] programming world so I don't know what's
[44:29] public or not. So I'm like I you know
[44:31] we've got some cool surprises. We've got
[44:33] some really really fun things. And I
[44:35] think from thematic maybe the first year
[44:38] was was you know this is important or
[44:42] Bitcoin is something relevant that we
[44:45] should talk about. It touches things. Um
[44:48] I think last year's summit is also the
[44:52] you know it's like it's still we're
[44:54] still I'm I'm going to say year three
[44:56] we're still explaining and in and
[44:59] emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin
[45:03] sad not sadly but like I think there's
[45:05] been a ton that's that's been done and a
[45:07] ton of progress and a ton of growth but
[45:09] at the end of the day it's like in
[45:13] traditional lobbying there's
[45:16] understanding
[45:17] of the issue like with weed or with
[45:19] abortion or with guns like right all of
[45:21] those issues there's a fundamental
[45:23] understanding of what it is and the
[45:26] issue that we're coming up against is
[45:28] people don't know what Bitcoin is
[45:31] still like okay digital money digital
[45:35] gold cryptocurrency but as far as
[45:38] understanding what sets it apart
[45:41] understanding there's just so much
[45:43] education so coming at it the there will
[45:47] be a lot of fun new faces um that will
[45:50] be really special, but also kind of
[45:53] within the thematic umbrellas of
[45:56] Bitcoin, the asset, Bitcoin, the network
[46:00] and then the production and you know
[46:04] generation of Bitcoin because especially
[46:07] for a lot of the like relevant policies
[46:11] and regulations that are currently
[46:14] either in the way of of business growth
[46:18] practically in America. It's a lot in
[46:21] the energy and mining world because a
[46:23] lot of that is like the more highly
[46:25] regulated industry. So making sure
[46:28] there's education and understanding on
[46:32] what when we're saying mining what is
[46:35] that you know and I think there's still
[46:37] it's like when you've used the language
[46:40] and the nomenclature for a long time
[46:42] then you get used to it but remembering
[46:44] that we have a different vocabulary and
[46:46] we have a different set of
[46:47] understanding that has to get broken
[46:50] down and get explained and for you know
[46:53] a lot of the bigger mining companies
[46:55] have policy people have people that are
[46:57] really working on that education. So,
[46:59] it's partnering even with those Bitcoin
[47:01] mining companies to be able to clearly
[47:04] address and and show use cases and
[47:07] explain why we need regulation or
[47:11] protection or
[47:12] freedom to continue to grow and kind of
[47:17] even play it out a little of if America
[47:19] isn't the leader, like what does that
[47:22] mean? What what kind of, you know, is
[47:25] that what we want? and what would that
[47:27] look like if that happened? And I think
[47:29] exploring some of those topics and
[47:31] having some of those discussions, it's
[47:33] it's going to be really fun. I'm a
[47:35] little biased, I know. Um I think
[47:37] there's going to be the the party
[47:39] beforehand I'm really excited about. Um
[47:43] I'm planning it. So uh there there will
[47:47] be this is the this is the like alpha
[47:50] not has not been announced but there
[47:52] will be a live karaoke band that will be
[47:57] playing music for most of the night and
[48:00] then the very talented
[48:03] people will be tapped on the shoulder by
[48:07] me to be a part of kind of a show like a
[48:10] little rockamoto adjacent and And at the
[48:14] end of the night, it will be more of a
[48:16] free-for-all and uh you know, people
[48:18] will have been drinking and they, you
[48:20] know, have at it with a live band
[48:22] karaoke. Oh man. So, I can say uh Carla
[48:25] and I are going to be there and we're
[48:26] we're super stoked to come check this
[48:28] out. I know there's a much better chance
[48:30] that you're tapping Carla on the
[48:32] shoulder uh than than tapping me. No,
[48:34] please do not tap me actually. Uh not.
[48:37] Yeah. Uh but just wanted to put that out
[48:39] there. But no, I I mean like on on that
[48:43] note like Mills, I know you you'd
[48:44] mentioned previously like there's it's
[48:46] not like BPI isn't just like the you
[48:48] know putting out these uh papers and
[48:50] doing this like congressional outreach
[48:52] like there's other elements to kind of
[48:53] the community outreach let's say. Can
[48:56] you talk a little bit about that aspect
[48:58] of it? Like how does that factor into
[49:00] the larger kind of goals of BPI? Why is
[49:03] that even like important?
[49:05] Yeah. Well, my my title is director of
[49:09] community affairs. So, it's funny
[49:12] because our director of government
[49:14] affairs, that's like a very DC title. I
[49:17] don't know that community affairs anyone
[49:19] else in DC has, but it's kind of we're
[49:21] trying to play the game, but also
[49:23] there's a pun in there. If you know, you
[49:25] know. But the building of community was
[49:30] really important and when is really
[49:32] important uh to BPI and when they
[49:37] initially reached out to me and talked
[49:39] to me about this role it's like hey
[49:41] there isn't a ton of community there are
[49:45] some Bitcoiners that live in DC but
[49:48] there just isn't a vibrant Bitcoin
[49:50] community that exists here and that is
[49:54] uh that grassroots level is a really
[49:56] important way for education to really be
[50:00] successful, to have that rooting. And
[50:03] yeah, we're going to keep talking to the
[50:04] elected officials and we're going to
[50:05] keep trying, but also if there's a a
[50:09] community that has a presence
[50:11] physically, it's another solidifying
[50:14] force and very exciting news. Um, at
[50:18] some point in this year, you know, Pub
[50:21] Key DC will open and we'll have our
[50:24] offices within. So stay tuned on news on
[50:28] that. Um, but that'll be really huge.
[50:30] And right now we're hosting a monthly
[50:34] happy hour and it's it's so silly the
[50:38] people that are there that are like
[50:39] sometimes they think it's bank policy
[50:41] institute. like someone from the FDI
[50:43] came last week and then was talking to
[50:45] me about like what I think the future of
[50:46] banking is and regulations and I was I
[50:49] was trying to pawn him off because I'm
[50:52] like I I don't know that I am the right
[50:54] person to be answering your questions
[50:56] because I'm trying to you know like put
[50:58] blinders on and be like okay so imagine
[51:01] I've worked at the FDI for 10 years and
[51:03] I do research so what is my worldview
[51:05] what do I believe what part of Bitcoin
[51:08] is not going to make me sound like a
[51:10] crazy person what will he be able to
[51:12] hear. I was I don't know that I've ever
[51:14] been in a conversation in my life where
[51:17] I started sweating, but I I started
[51:19] sweating during this. I was like he just
[51:21] kept asking like hard-hitting,
[51:23] hard-hitting, hard-hitting. Anyway, but
[51:26] normally the happy hours are like, "Oh,
[51:29] there's some CIA people that like
[51:31] Bitcoin. Oh, there's some people from
[51:33] It's It's really wild because it's like
[51:37] Bitcoiners and Bitcoiners that have jobs
[51:40] that you're like, "How? What? Huh?" So,
[51:45] it's really surprising. Always a wild
[51:49] different selection and smattering. This
[51:52] This month, actually, on May 22nd on
[51:54] Bitcoin Pizza Day, we're hosting a
[51:56] familyfriendly I'm very excited about
[51:58] this one.
[51:59] familyfriendly. Like it's a happy hour,
[52:02] but we'll be having pizza um in DC and
[52:04] it's going to be it's going to be a
[52:07] really good time. I think it's taken
[52:08] some time to get to know all the people
[52:10] that are already here that have been
[52:12] doing community things, but I think
[52:14] that's starting to grow and having more
[52:16] stability and saying we're going to keep
[52:18] throwing happy hours. people just if you
[52:22] have a question, if you're curious, if
[52:24] you want to talk about Bitcoin, if you
[52:25] want to meet other Bitcoiners, just
[52:26] having things happening in DC for people
[52:30] to kind of come and meet up with each
[52:32] other. Did you ask the CIA guys if they
[52:35] created
[52:36] Bitcoin? No, I'm just kidding. No, but
[52:38] in all seriousness, I think that idea of
[52:40] like the, you know, like the third place
[52:43] is really important, right? Like that's
[52:44] what Pubkey is, right? That's what like
[52:47] uh like for anyone that's not familiar
[52:49] like the third place is like it's not
[52:51] work or school and it's not home. Like
[52:54] it's it's another place that you can go
[52:55] and like maybe it's church, maybe it's a
[52:58] bar, maybe it's whatever, but like maybe
[52:59] it's you know a Bitcoin meetup, but it's
[53:01] like having a different type of place
[53:03] where you can go and have conversations
[53:05] that you don't have at any of those
[53:06] other places. And like I mean yeah, I
[53:10] I'm sure you get some very interesting
[53:12] characters uh in there. It's interesting
[53:14] too about just like the, you know, you
[53:16] never know in what roles you may find
[53:19] like kind of quiet Bitcoiners like who
[53:22] are just like it's kind of like
[53:24] Bitcoiners like uh not only is Bitcoin a
[53:27] Trojan horse, but kind of like
[53:28] Bitcoiners as well are like individual
[53:29] Trojan horses. Like we're kind of
[53:31] everywhere and you just never know where
[53:33] you're going to find one. And like I
[53:34] think that's kind of a cool thing. Like
[53:36] it's it's very powerful also cuz it's
[53:38] like we're just slowly infiltrating, you
[53:40] know, spreading our orange tentacles
[53:42] into everything we can get into in like
[53:44] a very not but like but we're not trying
[53:46] to like do weird stuff. We're just
[53:47] trying to give you more freedom so like
[53:48] you can feel good about it which is
[53:50] nice. There are definitely like surprise
[53:52] Bitcoiners out there that wear suits
[53:54] already that that just were waiting I
[53:57] think for something a little bit more in
[54:00] their comfort zone to come to DC or to
[54:03] come to Bitcoin if that makes sense. But
[54:05] um yeah, there are definitely people
[54:07] I've met that were already I I like
[54:10] approach probably the first first go
[54:12] round of of being at an event in DC. I
[54:15] was thinking that a lot like no one
[54:16] knows anything about Bitcoin because
[54:19] they're all from the DC world and no
[54:23] offense that is super terrible of me to
[54:26] even think but I you know assumptions
[54:29] were made. They weren't in t-shirts and
[54:30] hoodies like I didn't know and um and
[54:33] but then I'd find out like oh you're
[54:35] actually already you're very
[54:38] knowledgeable in this like this is not
[54:39] new to you at all. they've just kind of
[54:42] been like in the in the world but on the
[54:46] sidelines like and I think what Mills is
[54:48] doing is really awesome. It's giving me
[54:51] like so much FOMO of wanting to be in DC
[54:54] every month for and and even more than
[54:57] like more often than that I like have a
[54:59] FOMO event every week at least. Um so
[55:02] they you know like it's it's great. I
[55:04] think this could be like a really big
[55:06] statement, but I think that what's going
[55:10] to be going on with Bitcoin in DC is
[55:12] going to have it be a city that's like
[55:15] on the map for Bitcoiners. Not maybe not
[55:18] like Nashville or Austin yet, but it's
[55:21] definitely going to have a draw. I think
[55:24] for sure. I think that's it's a good
[55:27] that's a good thing, too, right? like we
[55:29] want like it'd be good if the nation's
[55:31] capital was also like a Bitcoin hub full
[55:34] of lots of toxic psychopaths. Like
[55:36] that's something that I would want, you
[55:37] know?
[55:39] Yeah. And the more Bitcoin cities, the
[55:42] more the more we just have kind of the
[55:45] community aspect within different
[55:47] cities, the stronger, you know,
[55:50] ultimately our network becomes. And I
[55:53] think there's it's small here. When I
[55:56] moved to Nashville, I was shocked at how
[55:58] many Bitcoiners there were, but there
[56:00] wasn't something there wasn't a meetup,
[56:02] but there was there were just lots of
[56:04] people that were going about their lives
[56:05] being Bitcoiners. So, I think this is a
[56:08] lot of, you know, settling the frontier
[56:11] in Nashville versus DC, the new Wild
[56:15] West, the new frontier. uh it feels a
[56:18] lot more grassroots
[56:21] to educate and to kind of inspire and to
[56:26] kind of get people even interested. And
[56:29] I don't if there are secret Bitcoiners
[56:32] like meeting underground. I haven't been
[56:34] invited yet. I would love to be invited.
[56:37] That would be so nice. Let me know. I'm
[56:39] deplatformed actually on Twitter, so I
[56:42] can't uh I can't answer a DM, but you
[56:45] know, Noster hasn't kicked me off. So,
[56:48] wait, did you get when did you get
[56:49] kicked off kicked off Twitter or X,
[56:52] excuse me? I know. I still call it
[56:55] Twitter. It happened. It was either last
[56:57] week or the week. I think it was early
[56:59] last week. What did you do? You know,
[57:02] honestly, I the last thing that I did
[57:05] was I retweeted our head of policy, Zach
[57:08] Shapiro, who's a very like he'll say
[57:12] these big things, but he's very well
[57:13] spoken and he's been super involved in
[57:17] the Samurai case and recently like well
[57:22] well-worded little rant about basically
[57:25] they prosecuted as money transmitting
[57:28] even though they knew that Samurai
[57:30] wasn't isn't money transmitting. And I
[57:34] I'm going to be honest, injustice isn't
[57:37] great. Doesn't sit well with me. I have
[57:39] a really tough time with it. And that
[57:42] was what I retweeted. And like I don't
[57:46] think I put any flavor. I don't
[57:49] remember, but I that was my last action.
[57:51] And I have this I'll show you what what
[57:54] it it looks like on my phone. It's
[57:56] really funny. And um Matt Pines looked
[57:58] me up the other day. He's like, "Yeah,
[58:00] you don't exist." This is when I load
[58:01] it. This is what it is.
[58:05] And it's still What What does that say
[58:06] on there? I can't quite I just see. So,
[58:08] oops. Something went wrong. Please try
[58:10] again later. Uh-oh. An error was
[58:12] encountered. Try again. And I'm just um
[58:16] if you go like I can see this is my
[58:19] handle, but I'm just fully I've tried
[58:23] tried putting it I've tried it on on
[58:27] desktop. Yeah. I'm I don't know. That's
[58:30] That's so crazy. I'm pretty sure I
[58:32] retweeted the same thing, but I need to
[58:34] go check now. It didn't get me booted
[58:37] unless I like retweeted something else
[58:39] adjacent that wasn't the
[58:42] controversial thing. I don't know.
[58:45] That's really crazy. Wait, what was it
[58:46] that was so controversial about like
[58:50] what like cuz I I I uh I listened to his
[58:53] he was just on uh what Bitcoin did uh
[58:56] with with Danny. It was like great
[58:57] episode. highly recommend people check
[58:59] it out. Always happy to show other
[59:01] people's podcasts because again we need
[59:03] more. Um, great episode and like I
[59:06] didn't know the whole thing about the
[59:08] FDIC basically told the federal
[59:10] prosecutors like oh no they're not money
[59:14] transmitters and then the federal
[59:16] prosecutors were like okay wait 6 months
[59:18] and then literally like arrest them
[59:21] which is like but the people who are in
[59:24] like the people who are in charge of the
[59:27] rules that you say they're breaking said
[59:29] they weren't breaking the rules so like
[59:32] what the
[59:34] like so did you I mean did you like did
[59:37] you throw like an extra spicy quote
[59:39] tweet on there or like what
[59:42] you know I can't in my mind like I
[59:46] didn't think I was doing anything that
[59:48] would cost me my freedom of speech um
[59:51] and I thought we were past those days
[59:53] regardless um I I don't I think it was
[59:57] it's like maybe something of if the
[59:59] people in power abuse their power like
[60:02] what does that mean for our freedom or
[60:05] you know something probably like
[60:07] slightly philosophical and like
[60:10] nothing crazy. You weren't like murder
[60:13] them. Yeah. Right. Right. No, I mean
[60:16] Well, yeah. Who knows? Um I mean I guess
[60:19] like I'm very glad Noster exists. Like
[60:23] we're live streaming there right now and
[60:25] nobody can shut that down. Um, and
[60:28] nobody can deplatform you off of your uh
[60:30] off of your endpub, which is a very
[60:32] powerful thing. Like, I don't know. It's
[60:35] uh, you know, I I always worry because
[60:38] it's like I think things are probably,
[60:41] as much as there seems to be like a a
[60:43] bit of a vibe shift towards like more
[60:46] free speech and more, you know, yeah,
[60:48] like let's get some more of that freedom
[60:50] back in
[60:51] here. H at the end of the day, like the
[60:54] bureaucracy is so incredibly entrenched
[60:56] and like the like the state apparatus,
[60:59] the surveillance state, the
[61:00] military-industrial complex, like all of
[61:02] these incredibly powerful entrenched
[61:04] institutions and three-letter agencies
[61:06] that
[61:08] like yeah, the administration may
[61:10] change, but you're never going to like
[61:12] root out all of the deep state. Like
[61:15] that's just not going to happen. And so
[61:17] like I think the surveillance state gets
[61:20] a lot worse before it gets any better.
[61:22] Like I don't know. Sadly, I I agree with
[61:25] you and I I I mean I'm really antisocial
[61:28] media and I think it's funny that I like
[61:30] the two that that that I had LinkedIn
[61:33] cuz I it was my only connection to
[61:35] people I went to college with and ex I'm
[61:38] deplatformed on both of those. So I
[61:41] guess jokes on me like you try to hold
[61:43] on you you just whatever you get learn
[61:46] you you learn a lesson but ultimately I
[61:50] think until people realize that the
[61:53] amount of access and monitoring and data
[61:55] harvesting and information that they are
[61:59] giving away for free until everyone
[62:01] knows that they are the product they
[62:04] like it's going to keep getting worse
[62:06] and I I actually fear for like more of
[62:09] the social credit or the like I it
[62:12] becoming important like if you don't
[62:15] have social media then you can't do
[62:17] things because they can't get your like
[62:20] your character they don't know and I I I
[62:24] know that's black mirror but I also know
[62:26] that that's real in China so also
[62:29] there's there's the reality that I feel
[62:31] like a lot of people think it's
[62:33] convenient think that social media has
[62:36] no downside it's all like great. They're
[62:40] really into it. And I know I'm on the
[62:42] extreme end that is like a a supreme
[62:46] social media disrespector, but at the
[62:48] same time, I think we're going to have
[62:51] to learn the hard way because everyone
[62:53] else is just
[62:55] so you don't realize it until I think
[62:59] someone has to go without it for a few
[63:02] days or a week or hours or whatever.
[63:05] like everyone is so hooked up to the IV
[63:08] that is just inundating and they're
[63:11] living on the drip system of
[63:13] information. And I think that's where a
[63:15] lot of the closed-mindedness comes from
[63:17] because they're perpetuating and just
[63:21] completely drunk on whatever they're
[63:24] being told to be listening to or not be
[63:26] listening to. And I think that's the
[63:29] real problem because critical thinking
[63:31] has been gone for so long in the
[63:33] mainstream. And so there's just a
[63:35] close-mindedness, but but then there's a
[63:38] gaslighting. If you told anyone they're
[63:40] close-minded, it's like, no, you're
[63:42] being hateful now, which it's like, I
[63:45] don't know how to live in this world,
[63:46] guys.
[63:49] Yeah. I don't know. It's like I I think
[63:53] like many people I have kind of like a a
[63:55] lovehate relationship with social media
[63:57] because on the one hand like social
[63:59] media has allowed me to meet all of
[64:01] these incredible Bitcoiners such as
[64:03] yourselves who I now consider friends
[64:05] and like that's an incredible thing
[64:08] right on the other hand it's just an
[64:10] like the way that social media platforms
[64:13] and I'll separate that from protocols
[64:15] like noster but the way that these
[64:17] platforms have been constructed like
[64:19] they are meant to just trigger dopamine
[64:22] hit after dopamine hit and get you
[64:23] addicted and keep you coming back for
[64:25] more. And like, okay, there's like our
[64:27] generation, which is one thing. Like,
[64:29] we're not digital natives. We didn't
[64:32] like we remember dialup and DSL and
[64:36] like, you know, we remember things.
[64:38] Yeah. We remember things needing to
[64:39] buffer. Like that's like Yeah.
[64:43] like this the what I worry about is like
[64:46] the the Zoomers and the Gen Alpha like
[64:50] they have grown up with this as like
[64:53] this all this social media came right
[64:54] along with their mother's milk or like
[64:56] it's just it's a part of their lives
[64:59] from the start and we don't we have
[65:01] literally no idea what that's going to
[65:02] do to them in like 20 years like 40
[65:06] years like we don't know what the law
[65:08] like we're they're just they're guinea
[65:09] pigs like we're all guinea pigs too an
[65:11] extent event and like one thing I always
[65:13] find funny is like boomers were always
[65:16] the ones who are like you know that the
[65:18] Facebooks are going to rot your brains
[65:19] and stuff and then like who are the only
[65:21] people left on Facebook it's like the
[65:22] boomers you know like so I don't know
[65:24] there just a an aside there but like
[65:26] it's I don't know I don't know what
[65:28] happens in the long term but it's not
[65:29] going to be great
[65:31] well it's scary but also I think and
[65:35] maybe this is too bullish and too
[65:38] optimistic but I actually think because
[65:40] the zoomers
[65:41] are technative and did grow up. They
[65:45] have this they're they're almost like
[65:48] inherently accepting of Bitcoin in a way
[65:51] that millennials and Gen X like we had
[65:55] to learn it, understand it. It's
[65:56] internet money. It's like we had to
[65:58] learn the internet and understand what
[66:00] it is. Assummers don't understand the
[66:02] difference between data and Wi-Fi. A lot
[66:04] of them, I'm not saying all of them, but
[66:06] like there's internet, that's it. And
[66:09] like because we grew up where you once
[66:12] got internet on a CD that came in the
[66:16] mail that you put into a CD drive like
[66:18] all these archaic things. I think
[66:22] Bitcoin actually the timing of it all is
[66:25] is fantastic that all these zoomers I
[66:28] think they're less obsessed with the
[66:30] nuance and cool whatever of Bitcoin.
[66:34] They just see it as money because money
[66:36] for them has always been on their phone.
[66:38] Money money money isn't tactile. Money
[66:41] isn't physical for them. And so I
[66:43] actually think it's there's a hopeful
[66:45] edge to it. What does it mean social
[66:47] media wise and like mental health-wise?
[66:50] I don't know how that works out, but
[66:52] actually I think it's great for Bitcoin
[66:53] if they're around. I guess
[66:57] Oh, that's fair. Go ahead, Mez. That's
[67:00] very optimistic and I'm I hope that that
[67:03] is our reality. I like I hate Black
[67:06] Mirror because it is so it I can see the
[67:11] f. It's like just looking into the
[67:13] future. I think that when it first came
[67:15] out a lot of people just think this kind
[67:16] of crazy whatever. I don't think they
[67:18] like understood the gravity of how close
[67:20] we are. Like that's not like 30 years
[67:23] away a lot of the stuff that we've seen
[67:25] on there. So I don't watch it. Um, I
[67:28] can't I get so upset when my husband
[67:30] watches it because I don't even want to
[67:32] like think about that. Um, I will just
[67:36] go outside and Yeah. and be happy. Touch
[67:39] grass. Touch grass and and just try to
[67:42] like
[67:43] live the as long as I can in the world
[67:46] before we get taken over by, you know,
[67:49] social um credit control or whatever it
[67:52] might be. But I do I agree. I do like
[67:54] that we were able to, you know, become
[67:56] friends through otherwise I don't know
[67:59] that I would have crossed paths with
[68:00] y'all. Like if I not had um or any
[68:04] Bitcoiners, it would have been it would
[68:06] have taken a while for me to reach other
[68:08] Bitcoiners where I live. If I had not
[68:11] had Clubhouse and like had
[68:14] communications with other Bitcoiners for
[68:15] the first time, it's like reaching out
[68:17] to other aliens. Like they they exist.
[68:20] Like I I heard words. Yeah. like they're
[68:23] they're out there too. And then from
[68:25] there getting involved and going to
[68:27] conferences and meeting friends and
[68:29] volunteering for things and helping with
[68:32] stuff like that would not have happened
[68:34] without social media. But I kind of I I
[68:38] think I'm also a little bit just anti-
[68:40] it. I don't spend a lot of time on it.
[68:42] And I'm fortunate that I've made good
[68:44] community of Bitcoin friends. there's
[68:46] something that's breaking news and I
[68:48] work for a Bitcoin company so if there's
[68:50] some breaking news in Bitcoin I it
[68:52] filters through to me like from I don't
[68:54] have to be fully immersed in social
[68:56] media to follow it because when I was
[69:00] before I actually met other Bitcoiners I
[69:02] was in that world where like I had to be
[69:05] following on Twitter for an update you
[69:07] know like what's the crazy Bitcoin thing
[69:09] that's happening right now or what's the
[69:12] latest argument amongst Bitcoiners
[69:14] that's going
[69:15] I I don't have to search for that as
[69:18] much. I don't really need social media
[69:20] like I used to, which is nice, but um I
[69:23] I am in agreement that it is it's not
[69:25] great. And it I hope that Mills's um
[69:29] optimistic future of what was going to
[69:31] happen will work out. I is it through
[69:35] social media that you and I met Mads
[69:38] because it was I know the first time we
[69:39] met was early Nashville Bitcoin meetup
[69:42] but is that how you found out about the
[69:44] meetup? I think that social media may
[69:48] have been how I found out about the
[69:49] meetup meetup or any like bit I think
[69:52] social media was the only way I knew
[69:54] that Bitcoiners beyond like in my
[69:57] household were that there were like a
[69:59] lot of them out there and doing events
[70:02] and stuff. Um I my dayto-day would not
[70:05] cross like outside of family members did
[70:07] not cross anyone else that was talking
[70:09] about
[70:10] Bitcoin even still it's still very
[70:14] foreign. Um but I'd gone to Tabco comp
[70:18] was my first event that I went to in
[70:20] person um back in I guess that was maybe
[70:24] 2021. So you're if that tracks with like
[70:27] early Nashville days because I think
[70:28] Nashville was not long after that. Some
[70:30] people I' Yeah. August of 21. Yeah, it
[70:34] was a um it was a lightning meetup and I
[70:37] was running my lightning node. So, all
[70:40] thanks to having met other Bitcoiners
[70:42] that said anyone can run a lightning
[70:44] node. So, yeah, I I think we met in
[70:48] physical person before I knew you
[70:51] online, but I would not have been there
[70:53] if I had not known through social media
[70:56] that that was going on. This this is the
[70:59] thing too is like like social media like
[71:01] itself like it it's a tool right it's
[71:03] not inherently bad like you see that it
[71:05] can be good like it can absolutely
[71:07] produce positive outcomes I think on
[71:09] noster you see a lot more of those
[71:11] positive outcomes produced because the
[71:12] incentive model is different it's like
[71:14] Bitcoin like Bitcoin is a tool it can be
[71:16] used to uh to finance dissident
[71:19] journalists and freedom fighters or it
[71:21] can be used to finance you know North
[71:23] Korea's military program or like it it
[71:25] doesn't like it doesn't matter matter.
[71:27] It's a tool, right? And so like the
[71:29] problem is ultimately like what are the
[71:31] incentives of the
[71:33] platform. What are those driving us
[71:35] towards? Cuz like if you're using
[71:37] something mindfully and very like
[71:39] consciously and you're aware of what it
[71:41] may do to you, you can avoid a lot of
[71:44] those negative effects. Like in you know
[71:45] if you like I I turn off like I like I
[71:48] don't have any push notifications turned
[71:50] on for X and I have not had them turned
[71:52] on for like years just because I don't I
[71:54] don't want to be bombarded with that. I
[71:56] don't like push notifications. Like if I
[71:59] open it up and see something then I see
[72:00] it. Like but like you can do things that
[72:03] allow you to get the most out of a
[72:05] really great tool because it is a tool
[72:07] for for you know social networking for
[72:09] cohesion for planning like for
[72:12] organizing. Like it's really powerful.
[72:14] It can be really shitty too if you're
[72:16] just sitting there mindlessly scrolling
[72:18] scrolling scrolling like face closer and
[72:20] closer to the phone, you know, brain
[72:22] further and further away from any sort
[72:24] of reality. like that's when it gets
[72:26] bad. But like like anything, if you use
[72:28] a tool
[72:30] mindfully, you're going to get something
[72:32] hopefully good out of that tool. I think
[72:33] the problem is that most people don't
[72:35] use things mindfully like at all. But
[72:37] that's like that's a different story,
[72:39] you know? I don't know if I don't know
[72:41] if that can be fixed. Like Bitcoin fixes
[72:43] a lot of things. It does not necessarily
[72:46] fix most people, you know,
[72:49] sadly. No. Yeah. I think that that's
[72:52] why now I'm I noster I say I say noster
[72:57] I know I'm in the minority here I know I
[72:59] know I really draw it out um but I I
[73:02] think I think the majority of people say
[73:03] noster um but why that was so is is and
[73:07] was and is so refreshing is that yes all
[73:10] social media is a tool but the the like
[73:13] it's like getting you know you have a
[73:14] hammer or you can get like this fancy
[73:16] contraption that does the same thing as
[73:18] a hammer but it it's like just a lot of
[73:20] extra and like that's like bring it back
[73:25] to the basics is is what's refreshing
[73:27] because even just trying to use Twitter
[73:31] as a basic tool to go on and like check
[73:33] in with friends or find a meetup or an
[73:36] event you it's it's programmed like to
[73:40] addict you like even if you get on for a
[73:42] few seconds it's pro like all of a
[73:44] sudden you're like 30 minutes later like
[73:46] oh my gosh I was I didn't even find what
[73:48] I was looking for because before I got
[73:50] there, I was something was like pushed
[73:53] in front of my face that it knows I
[73:55] wanted to dive down a rabbit hole about
[73:57] or something. And I think that there are
[74:00] good things to that because it helps
[74:03] sometimes you want might want to find
[74:05] those types of things that are kind of
[74:07] brought to the top of your feed. But
[74:10] it's also Yeah. It's it's got a lot of
[74:13] extra stuff and that a lot of the extra
[74:14] stuff can be really bad and really
[74:16] addictive and and like either yeah just
[74:19] circle you down and and who knows which
[74:22] direction of for the day but no is is
[74:26] like oh this is back to like just being
[74:28] able to connect with others you know
[74:30] without the algorithm like it's great I
[74:33] can and which is why I I'm not like I
[74:37] haven't forgotten about Noster I just
[74:39] don't use social media a lot so and It's
[74:41] very easy to disconnect from it. I don't
[74:44] have any like pinging me back on there
[74:48] and my life goes on. I can like not be
[74:51] on there and I can go out go on a hike
[74:55] and I'm not thinking about it while I'm
[74:57] on a hike. So, um, yeah, it's it's
[75:01] refreshing to have something that's like
[75:03] back to the beginning of why we use
[75:04] social media as a tool when there's the
[75:07] other stuff is just like super al
[75:10] algorithmized to like ruin your life
[75:12] maybe. I don't know. No, it's well, it's
[75:15] like having the ability to uh like to
[75:17] choose, right? It's optionality like
[75:19] because there are now options for
[75:21] different sorts of, you know, uh, you
[75:23] know, algorithms because an algorithm is
[75:25] just a set of steps, right? Like that's
[75:26] not inherently bad either. that's just a
[75:28] tool. But it's like you have the ability
[75:30] to choose at least. Whereas on X on I I
[75:34] I honestly haven't been on Facebook in
[75:36] so many years. I don't even know what
[75:37] their algorithm does these days. Like I
[75:39] think I I don't know how many it's been
[75:41] like since precoid I think that I've
[75:43] used Facebook. Like it's been a while.
[75:46] Um it's just all boomers I hear now. Uh
[75:48] all boomers who cannot distinguish AI
[75:50] from reality. Also that's a whole
[75:52] different thing. Like I think boomer
[75:53] boomers are really illquipped to figure
[75:55] out what is AI and what is like real.
[75:58] It'll be like Jesus riding a rainbow
[76:00] donkey and they'll be like, "Can you
[76:01] believe that? Where was this photo
[76:02] taken?" You're like, "Oh my god." But
[76:05] but yeah, like anything, it's it's a
[76:07] tool. And if you have the option to
[76:08] choose which tool to use that's going to
[76:10] benefit you and that doesn't just get
[76:12] you hooked into habit forming behavior
[76:14] so that you can Mads just say, "I'm just
[76:16] going to put this down and go take a
[76:17] hike and touch some grass." Like, man,
[76:19] that's like that's great. Like that
[76:21] that's ideal. You don't want to feel
[76:23] that you're somehow like missing
[76:25] something like you're missing stuff out
[76:26] there like you're missing all you know
[76:28] you miss 100% of the grass you never
[76:30] touched I think is what Wayne Gretzky
[76:33] said right
[76:35] I love that that that quote needs to be
[76:38] up on my wall
[76:39] um I'll I'll attribute it to you instead
[76:42] of Wayne Gretzky since you know we'll
[76:45] we'll give that one to you it's like
[76:48] yeah the Michael Scott thing you know
[76:50] like like Michael Scott
[76:52] Yeah, I'm sure he also said it just like
[76:55] that, but um for sure I'm going to
[76:57] attribute the quote on the wall like to
[76:59] you for for sure. I think that's a great
[77:01] one.
[77:03] But you know, okay, we we've uh we've
[77:05] I'm glad we got to a chance to talk
[77:06] about the the social media side of
[77:08] things too because like so much of the
[77:10] political discourse, this is me trying
[77:12] to bring the weave back full circle. So
[77:14] much of the political discourse now
[77:16] happens on social media. like so much of
[77:18] the posturing like you know it's no
[77:21] longer a uh a one to many information
[77:25] distribution system like you had with
[77:26] cable you know like cable news back in
[77:29] the day like you don't just you know the
[77:31] single anchor on the nightly news is not
[77:33] the sole source of truth anymore that's
[77:34] a really good thing uh and it's you know
[77:37] it's a decentralizing force essentially
[77:39] and I I think it's very fascinating how
[77:41] like I mean just like the the fact that
[77:45] politicians realize now that
[77:47] It's harder to your way around
[77:49] things. Like, you can still do a lot of
[77:51] bullshitting on social media, but where
[77:53] I think that things got really
[77:54] interesting this election cycle was with
[77:56] Trump doing this podcast circuit where
[77:58] it's like, can you riff for like 2 hours
[78:03] unscripted? Like, because it turns out a
[78:05] lot of politicians can't. and it becomes
[78:07] very clear that they can't after like 10
[78:11] minutes into an interview where it's
[78:13] like, oh, they've actually like never
[78:15] had a real conversation before. Like
[78:18] it's always been, you know, like off
[78:20] notes. Like I don't know. I didn't
[78:22] really have anywhere I was going with
[78:23] that. just more so marveling at the fact
[78:25] that like the vibe shift in the
[78:27] landscape is so real that podcasts like
[78:30] like the fear factor guy was like a
[78:33] deciding force in in like people's
[78:36] perception of the current sitting
[78:38] president of the United States like
[78:40] that's wild and like I loved Fear Factor
[78:42] so like you know go Joe Rogan wait so I
[78:45] I loved
[78:47] weed I'm so sorry guys I'm Joe Rogan was
[78:52] the fear factor
[78:54] Yeah, I didn't know this either. What?
[78:58] I'm sorry. I don't feel like he was on
[79:00] my timeline. What? Okay. Is this like a
[79:03] weird me? Okay,
[79:05] you guys. I'm arguing it. I actually
[79:08] don't know much about his background.
[79:10] So, I loved Fear Factor. I remember the
[79:13] sheep eyeballs. Like I I watched Fear
[79:16] Factor. Fear. I did not know that Joe
[79:21] Rogan had anything to do with Fear
[79:23] Factor. Joe
[79:26] Rogan was Fear Factor. Wait, with the
[79:30] hair
[79:31] that Joe Rogan?
[79:35] Yeah, this You didn't know this either,
[79:38] right? No, I didn't. I But I didn't
[79:40] follow Fear Factor as much. It's too
[79:42] scary.
[79:43] Like that this like this is part of Joe
[79:46] Rogan's like incredible, you know,
[79:49] trajectory here. Like I'm kind of
[79:51] mind-blown that neither of you guys knew
[79:53] this. I'm not going to lie. Well, I grew
[79:55] up very non um honestly it was amazing
[79:59] that I was allowed to watch Fear Factor
[80:01] period. Um but I think it was like no
[80:04] sex nudity so like you know got away
[80:07] with it.
[80:09] I have to like reformat my hard drive
[80:12] now knowing that Joe Rogan was Fear
[80:14] Factor Guy. So I'll by the time you see
[80:18] me in June, June 25th, 24th for the
[80:22] party at the summit, I'll have digested
[80:25] this. You'll have rewatched it all. And
[80:28] I mean Joe Rogan was basically the
[80:30] original like eat the bugs guy, but he's
[80:32] like I'll pay you at the end after you
[80:34] eat these bugs. Like I just I like
[80:38] you're gonna go back and rewatch this
[80:39] now with like a whole new lens. Like
[80:42] that's kind of beautiful. Like I I wish
[80:44] I could I wish I could be having this
[80:46] realization now. You know, this is
[80:49] mind-blowing. I I didn't I mean I
[80:51] expected to have a great time on this
[80:53] podcast. I didn't expect to like have
[80:54] one of my constructs burst and shatter
[80:58] and broken. But also, this is going to
[81:00] be funny. A lot of people will call me
[81:02] Mads. I know Mads gets called Mills as
[81:04] well now. I mean, we're not in the same
[81:07] room, but we're kind of It's proof that
[81:09] we are not the same person. There you
[81:10] go. And now that we work at BPI in the
[81:14] office, sometimes they call me Mads,
[81:16] too. And they work with me. And I know
[81:19] I'm not ever in the office. She's not in
[81:22] the office. So, this is going to maybe
[81:25] this is going to like be a mind-blowing
[81:27] like they thought we were the same
[81:29] person the whole time. There are people
[81:31] that will literally have a whole
[81:32] conversation with me that I know think
[81:33] I'm mad and sometimes I let it happen
[81:36] and I'm sorry if if anyone out there is
[81:39] watching this. I don't know. But you
[81:40] both did have the same uh you neither of
[81:43] you knew that Joe Rogan was Fear Factor
[81:45] guy. So now this is uh kind of throwing
[81:47] a wrench into your gears. A little too
[81:49] similar if you ask me. Crazy. No, I also
[81:53] did not watch Fear F I knew of Fear
[81:56] Factor. I didn't watch a ton of TV
[81:58] growing up either and like definitely
[82:00] did not watch Fear Factor because I'm
[82:02] afraid of bugs and that alone is like I
[82:05] don't want to sit through watching
[82:07] someone else's fear of bugs. Um not not
[82:10] for me but the you know so I I am just
[82:15] I'm more mind-blown that Mills was watch
[82:18] a watcher a viewer of this and is this
[82:21] mind blown. Um, but I like the I was an
[82:24] adrenaline. I would say I'm a recovering
[82:26] adrenaline junkie that like I used to
[82:28] skateboard, BMX. Like I feel like I
[82:32] guess Daredevil, but I loved the
[82:34] adrenaline rush and the like the fear
[82:38] factor. I always thought I could crush
[82:40] it honestly. I've like definitely think
[82:42] I would have nailed it. Absolutely. Cuz
[82:44] I'm not really afraid of heights. I
[82:46] don't really mind bugs. It's like I
[82:47] don't like them and I'm not like excited
[82:49] about eating a scorpion or whatever, but
[82:51] like I just knew I could do it. Be a
[82:54] little weird if you were if you're like,
[82:55] "God, I can't stop eating these
[82:56] scorpions." Man, delicious. Little bit
[82:58] of Sriracha on there. Oh, it's good. I
[83:01] mean, I have a scorpion in this bottle
[83:02] of mezcow that I bought in Mexico. And I
[83:05] fully intend on like trying it because
[83:06] like that's kind of funny. Sorry. Just a
[83:10] little just a little nibble. No. Yeah.
[83:13] I've got the opposite of I'm like afraid
[83:14] of heights, afraid of bugs, afraid of
[83:18] eating weird stuff, a lot of things. And
[83:20] then also on top of all that, like my I
[83:24] was so afraid of like things like I was
[83:26] afraid of getting hit by the ball in
[83:27] base in softball and soccer. So like I I
[83:30] went with running, you know, like the
[83:31] safest like just can run in a straight
[83:35] line and ideally not have to worry about
[83:37] the the fear of getting like like hurt
[83:42] by something. So definitely not a fear
[83:45] factor person if if and Mills and I
[83:47] Yeah, clearly where we're different. We
[83:49] finally have we have a divergent path
[83:51] now. So, if you're not sure if you're
[83:54] talking to Mills or Mads, be like, "How
[83:55] do you feel about heights or scary
[83:59] thing?" And if it's pro, then it's me,
[84:01] and if it's auntie, it's Mads. Just hold
[84:04] up a scorpion. Be like, "Thoughts?"
[84:08] Still there, then it's Mills. But
[84:10] they're not. It was me and I'm long
[84:14] gone. Yeah. But hopefully we do. I mean,
[84:17] I know we probably have to wrap up, but
[84:19] also um you know, everyone that is at
[84:22] all interested, the summit is a really
[84:25] cool place to hear about what the
[84:28] current issues are and the discussions
[84:31] that are having. I think this is going
[84:32] to be a very historic installment of the
[84:36] policy summit in general. And I think
[84:39] like if anyone is interested, it is
[84:42] going to be very different than a
[84:44] Bitcoin conference where it's pretty
[84:45] much the same thing spoken by the same
[84:49] people every time, which I've been to
[84:51] like over 20 and at this point I'm I'm
[84:54] exhausted. I don't like sitting and
[84:56] listening. But yeah, we've got Senator
[84:58] Lumis, Hester Pierce, Nick Begage,
[85:00] Marshia Blackburn, Jim Justice, Warren
[85:02] Davidson. like we have such an
[85:07] incredible range and variety of issues
[85:10] that are really currently important and
[85:14] relevant. And I think this is going to
[85:16] be a pretty historical, if I if I do say
[85:19] so myself, I think this is going to be a
[85:20] pretty historical one. I'm stoked for it
[85:23] because I I haven't been to this kind of
[85:25] a uh Bitcoin event before. So, it's
[85:30] that's it's going to be it's going to be
[85:31] an interesting change, but like I'm I'm
[85:33] excited to check it out. And for anybody
[85:35] who's just uh who's just in the audio,
[85:38] um if you go to you can go to
[85:39] bdcpolicy.org or
[85:42] btdpolicsummit.org if you want more
[85:44] information. Um and I think any like
[85:46] anybody can can apply to get tickets. I
[85:49] think there is like you guys do review
[85:51] applications or something like that.
[85:53] Okay. Yeah, anyone can request a ticket.
[85:55] Actually, Mads and I both have our like
[85:58] discount code. I think it's just Mills21
[86:01] and Mads 21. And that that would flag
[86:04] that you like watched this show. Unless
[86:08] Mads you've been like I just called you
[86:10] Mills. Almost called you Mills. See you
[86:12] do it yourself.
[86:13] Wow. Unless you've been using that code.
[86:16] I haven't been shilling that code. I sh
[86:20] it. So yeah favorite. I'm just kidding.
[86:24] Yeah, it's a competition now. Um, no,
[86:26] no, no. See, again, don't like
[86:29] competitions over here. So, so that's
[86:31] another difference. I have four
[86:32] brothers. I just grew up in competition.
[86:35] Here it is. Um,
[86:37] have four brothers, but that's not
[86:40] helpful. That one's not helpful.
[86:42] Competition. Yeah, I know. It's It is
[86:44] That is one of our weird This is getting
[86:46] ridiculous over here. Now, I feel like
[86:47] you guys are doing a bit like I feel
[86:49] like I'm doing No, we're not. Okay, I
[86:52] promise. Bye. Yeah, but use either of
[86:55] our codes for 21% off of your ticket
[86:58] price and then if you use that code,
[87:01] we'll know that you are watching this.
[87:03] So, yeah, it the applications get
[87:06] reviewed typically every day. Um, and
[87:09] there's a few different You can get just
[87:11] the summit day and that includes
[87:13] admission to the pre-party on the 24th
[87:16] or you can do the day on the hill that
[87:17] Mads was talking about where you can go
[87:19] talk to congressman legislation. you can
[87:21] like be able to like explain and discuss
[87:24] Bitcoin or like policy, but also just
[87:27] explaining Bitcoin to elected officials,
[87:30] which it's a pretty cool way. I think
[87:33] it's if you're a nerd like me, it's
[87:35] really cool. So, I I can go in there and
[87:38] go to uh my my Illinois senators and
[87:43] Congress persons and uh and just drop
[87:46] some Bitcoin knowledge.
[87:48] Yeah, they they set up appointments with
[87:51] So, yeah, just put in your request of
[87:53] Illinois people. They that like we're
[87:56] working with a a org that will set up
[87:58] all those appointments so that they'll
[88:00] be expecting us and it's like 10
[88:02] minutes. She'll drop some knowledge.
[88:04] Peace out. Can I go in there and just
[88:06] talk to them about my podcast? Be like,
[88:08] here's why you should uh No, I'm
[88:10] kidding. Uh no, I I will be on my best
[88:12] behavior. I won't say Titcoin at all. I
[88:15] promise. Uh it'll be very very
[88:17] respectable. Uh but yeah. No, I'm I'm so
[88:20] So they can use either MADS or Mills uh
[88:23] for the codes. That's sweet. Mads 21 or
[88:27] Mills 21. Mads 21 mills. I I'll I'll
[88:30] throw them in the show notes, too. Stop
[88:32] the like make it competition free. They
[88:35] can just use either and put a note that
[88:37] they saw us on your podcast um when they
[88:40] check out. That way we'll know. We can
[88:43] just Yeah, we'll we'll just pull share.
[88:46] Yeah.
[88:47] Yeah. I like it. It's a It's a It's not
[88:50] a competition. It's a It's a
[88:51] cooperation.
[88:53] Yes. It's It's We're the same person.
[88:56] I'm just kidding. There we go. Oh god.
[89:00] It all goes back to the same person, you
[89:02] know, either way. This has gone too far.
[89:04] This has gone too far. The simulation is
[89:06] is breaking. Well, hey, uh I want to
[89:09] thank you both for coming on here. I'm
[89:10] super stoked about this. I'm going to be
[89:12] talking to a few other of the uh BPI
[89:15] fellows such as yourself and I don't
[89:17] mean fellows as uh not fellows but
[89:19] fellows just to clarify. Um, and uh,
[89:22] just super stoked about everything you
[89:24] guys are doing cuz again like I know
[89:26] both of you and kind of where you're
[89:28] both at and that uh, neither of you are,
[89:30] you know, statist shills and it makes me
[89:33] very happy that a bunch of radical
[89:35] Bitcoiners are actively working in the
[89:37] belly of the beast to try and make sure
[89:39] that our government doesn't do things
[89:42] that are really really uh, stupid uh,
[89:45] with regard to Bitcoin and people's
[89:46] ability to use it in a way that is
[89:48] respected by the law because like nobody
[89:51] needs permission to use Bitcoin, but
[89:52] also like the government making it a
[89:54] pain in the ass to do any normal
[89:56] transactions with Bitcoin. Like nobody
[89:58] wants that. Like let's let's stay as far
[90:01] away from that as we can. And uh so
[90:03] appreciate the work y'all are doing.
[90:05] Anywhere else you want to send people
[90:06] bdc
[90:07] uhpolicy.org bdc
[90:09] policysummit.org. I'll link both of your
[90:11] noters since mill you do not have an X
[90:13] anymore. Uh, anywhere else you should uh
[90:16] send people?
[90:19] Um, send everyone to DC. So, okay, there
[90:22] you go. And and yeah, come to pizza day
[90:26] on the 22nd if you're seeing this and
[90:28] you're in DC.
[90:30] Pizza Day. Love it. I wish I could come.
[90:32] I myself enjoy pizza. What kind of pizza
[90:35] is it though? Is are we talking like
[90:37] thin crust? It's Gordon Ramsay's street
[90:40] pizza. It's across from um like where
[90:43] our new office will be. And we will have
[90:46] a Satoshi special of pepperoni,
[90:50] pineapple, and jalapeno. But the main
[90:52] will be like margarita. And it's good.
[90:55] It's like woodfired. If there's any
[90:57] Italians listening to this, they're
[90:58] going to be super pissed about the uh
[91:00] the pineapple. But no, I we actually
[91:03] have an Italian in our Bitcoiner like
[91:06] community group in DC and he's
[91:08] threatened to not come to the pizza day
[91:11] and I said it's you don't have to eat
[91:14] it. I'm sorry that this is offensive.
[91:17] We've had multiple exchanges about it. I
[91:19] think he's going to still attend. He
[91:20] does love the community, but we got we
[91:23] do have some some drama, some crisis
[91:25] about it, but it'll be it'll be a good
[91:27] uh familyfriendly pizza day celebration.
[91:30] I love it. Well, Mads, Mills, Mills,
[91:33] Mads, Milm, Mads, uh, thank you both so
[91:36] much for joining. Appreciate it. And
[91:39] looking forward to seeing you both in
[91:41] DC.
[91:42] Yes. Thank you so much for having us.
