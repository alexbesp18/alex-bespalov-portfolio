[00:00] It's great the Trump administration has
[00:01] walked back some of that. They said
[00:03] we're not going to bring these kinds of
[00:05] charges, but whoever is in the White
[00:07] House next can undo that and probably
[00:09] will. You know, the pendulum likes to
[00:10] swing both ways. It will presumably
[00:12] swing the other way soon. Whether people
[00:14] are happy or not with that, that might
[00:15] mean anti-crypto, anti- Bitcoin. And
[00:18] this is something they will probably try
[00:20] again. And if they do, that means we
[00:24] don't get access to the kinds of good
[00:25] wallets we want. We don't get access to
[00:26] Phoenix. We're not going to get access
[00:27] to Lightning wallets. Roll-ups are dead.
[00:30] Arc, Spark, all of these things that you
[00:32] might have heard of or might not have
[00:34] heard of yet that are coming down the
[00:36] pipeline to wallets to improve the UX,
[00:39] make it really, really usable, make
[00:40] Bitcoin awesome, we can't have as
[00:43] Americans, we can't build in America,
[00:46] and we can't allow others to service to
[00:48] Americans. So, we need need to get the
[00:50] law changed so that developers, so that
[00:52] people running these kinds of wallets
[00:53] are protected so that we can have access
[00:55] to these things in the US.
[01:04] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:06] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:08] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:12] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:14] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:16] Bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:19] right now, remember you are still early.

[01:51] Without further ado, let's get into this
[01:53] Bitcoin talk.
[02:01] Matt, glad to have you here. Uh
[02:04] hopefully you're also relatively
[02:06] recovered from Vegas. Uh but I know
[02:08] you've been you've been hitting the
[02:09] circuit of podcasts, so that can be uh
[02:11] can be quite taxing. Yeah, thanks for
[02:14] having me. Yeah, I've been uh on tour as
[02:16] it were um trying to get the message
[02:19] out. It's
[02:20] been, you know, it's fun. It's fun to
[02:22] hang out and chat Bitcoin with people
[02:24] for an hour at a time, but it also means
[02:26] I don't get my normal work done. Yeah.
[02:29] And and just for So, you are uh what
[02:31] what is you're you're head of something
[02:34] at Spiral, right? Um I don't know. I'm
[02:37] I'm an engineer. I'm I guess I'm the
[02:39] most tenur engineer on the Spiral team.
[02:41] Uh so we work on Lightning. We work on
[02:44] making lightning more accessible, better
[02:46] for wallets, and hoping to our real goal
[02:50] is to make Bitcoin the best money. I
[02:52] mean, that's that's the top one of
[02:54] Block's topline goals. Um, and to use
[02:56] that within Block, but then our goal at
[02:58] Spiral is to just just make Bitcoin the
[03:00] best money. I I still remember and I I
[03:04] mentioned this to you at uh in
[03:06] Vegas. One of the Bitcoin conference
[03:08] presentations uh from all the
[03:10] conferences I've been to that has stuck
[03:12] with me the most and that I will just
[03:13] always remember was your talk at uh uh
[03:17] Tabcom uh in 2022. I think that was
[03:20] basically the the premise was like
[03:22] lightning screwed, but maybe not. But it
[03:24] is, but maybe not. And I I don't know.
[03:27] It was just it was it was it was
[03:28] masterful. Well, I kind I maybe want to
[03:31] revisit some of your thesis from that a
[03:33] little bit later on in this just because
[03:35] I thought that was a just a banger of a
[03:37] talk. Also, your the keynote that you
[03:40] gave right before you were the last
[03:41] speaker before Trump went on stage last
[03:44] year, which was amazing because you gave
[03:46] a really important like not just some
[03:48] fluffy, you know, NGU talk. You gave
[03:51] like a hey, this is a thing we need to
[03:53] pay attention to with mining
[03:54] centralization. Uh, and you gave it up
[03:56] it to the most packed house you possibly
[03:58] could have. So, I thought that was that
[04:00] was pretty cool. Oh, yeah. The most
[04:02] packed house of people on their phones.
[04:04] Well, okay. Fair, fair enough. Fair. I
[04:06] was paying attention to it for what it's
[04:08] worth. And for sure, for sure some
[04:10] others were as well. Uh, but that Yeah,
[04:12] that's fair. Um, but okay, today and
[04:15] like the reason that that you had
[04:16] reached out, we chatted at the
[04:18] conference a little bit. You had some
[04:19] very uh some very cool hats which I
[04:21] believe you're wearing now. Yep. Okay.
[04:23] Awesome. So, I'm just going to
[04:24] preemptively tell people to go to save
[04:27] ourwallets.org. Uh, which I thought
[04:29] initially just knowing you, I was like,
[04:30] is this going to be some sort of a deep
[04:32] troll? Is this like is this Matt playing
[04:34] some sort of a long game? No, no, no.
[04:36] This is this is very uh very real and a
[04:38] very serious thing. So, I want to just
[04:40] kind of get right into that to make sure
[04:42] we we cover it. Can you tell us like
[04:45] what is going on? What is
[04:46] savewallets.org and like what are we
[04:48] talking about here? Why is there why did
[04:50] you create a website just for uh for
[04:52] this? Yeah. Yeah. So in the the so most
[04:56] people are familiar with the samurai and
[04:58] the NATO cash cases. Uh the DOJ brought
[05:01] charges against non-custodial wallet
[05:04] non-custodial platform um saying oh you
[05:07] were a money transmitter which basically
[05:10] is the class of rules that requires KYC
[05:13] AML all the stuff that you'd have to do
[05:15] at a bank. Uh all the stuff that you
[05:17] have to do with a custodial institution.
[05:19] Um, and they said, "No, no, no. Even
[05:21] though you were non-custodial, you had
[05:22] to comply with all these laws. It was
[05:25] not possible for them to comply with
[05:26] these laws. The the people they were
[05:28] supposed to register with would not have
[05:30] accepted their registration because they
[05:32] didn't think they needed to register.
[05:33] But nonetheless, the DOJ brought these
[05:35] charges. Um, and you know, maybe they'll
[05:39] win in court. The DOJ has now dropped
[05:41] some of those charges, but importantly,
[05:43] it it had a chilling effect, right? We
[05:44] saw Phoenix, this great lightning
[05:46] wallet, decide to pull out of the US
[05:48] market. Um, and a lot of developers were
[05:50] asking questions. So, yeah, it's great
[05:53] the Trump administration has walked back
[05:55] some of that. They said, "We're not
[05:57] going to bring these kinds of charges,
[05:59] but whoever is in the White House next
[06:00] can undo that." Um, and probably will.
[06:03] You know, the pendulum likes to swing
[06:04] both ways. It will presumably swing the
[06:07] other way soon. Um, whether people are
[06:10] happy or not with that, that might mean
[06:11] anti-crypto, anti- Bitcoin, and this is
[06:15] something they will probably try again.
[06:17] And if they do, that means we don't get
[06:20] access to the kinds of good wallets we
[06:22] want. We don't get access to Phoenix.
[06:23] We're not going to get access to
[06:24] lightning wallets. Rollups are dead,
[06:26] arc, spark, all of these things that you
[06:29] might have heard of or might not have
[06:30] heard of yet that are coming down the
[06:32] pipeline to wallets to improve the UX,
[06:35] make it really, really usable. Make
[06:37] Bitcoin awesome. we can't have as
[06:40] Americans. We can't build an America and
[06:42] we can't allow others to service to
[06:45] Americans,
[06:46] which is which is kind of insane because
[06:49] purportedly we're the freest country in
[06:51] the world. It see supposedly and by many
[06:55] metrics, yes, like you know, I I forget
[06:57] who it was that described this way. It
[06:59] may have been may have been Greg Foss, a
[07:01] Canadian who, you know, is looking for
[07:03] down from our American attic at America,
[07:05] but saying basically, you know,
[07:06] America's the prettiest horse at the
[07:07] glue factory. like, yeah, it's still a
[07:09] horse at the glue factory, but it's the
[07:10] best looking one there. But, this is
[07:13] kind of insane, though. And just to uh
[07:15] to loop back on one thing you mentioned,
[07:16] because I think this is actually really
[07:18] important for people to realize why the
[07:21] pendulum swinging back and forth
[07:23] actually makes such a difference and you
[07:25] need like you need actual protections
[07:27] like that are codified into law.
[07:30] the uh Fininsen basically said no this
[07:33] uh this they're not violating anything
[07:36] like this doesn't apply money
[07:37] transmitter doesn't apply from our
[07:39] perspective like no it's it's all good
[07:42] the prosecutors went ahead with it
[07:43] anyway knowing that and I think uh uh
[07:46] Sam Shapiro at the BC policy institute
[07:48] has done like a lot to kind of uncover
[07:50] that and showcase I know a lot of people
[07:51] have this is just what I've seen but
[07:53] this is kind of like why there is
[07:55] actually some uh some really dire need
[07:58] to make this stuff happen at a
[07:59] regulatory level because if it's just
[08:02] prosecutors from an administration being
[08:04] left up to it, they'll just do whatever
[08:05] they want. Like it doesn't matter what a
[08:06] particular agency says, right? Totally.
[08:08] Yeah. And you know, there are a lot of
[08:11] prosecutors in the United States. Uh
[08:14] they can make decisions. You know, the
[08:16] obviously their boss can tell them no,
[08:18] but whether they're paying close enough
[08:20] attention, but yeah, more importantly,
[08:21] the next administration, who knows what
[08:23] they're going to do. And so we really
[08:24] need to get the law changed. We need to
[08:26] make it clear that look, if you're not a
[08:28] custodial platform, you know, you still
[08:31] have to enforce sanctions. You still
[08:32] can't like open a channel with someone
[08:34] in Iran, whatever, but you don't have to
[08:37] do KYC, AML, these things that you can't
[08:40] actually do, right? We're not talking
[08:41] about stuff where it's like, ah, well,
[08:42] these wallets just don't want to do.
[08:44] It's like, no, they can't. You cannot do
[08:46] AML at that level on Lightning on any of
[08:49] these platforms. you know, you can't run
[08:52] a lightning wallet and submit to yearly
[08:54] examinations about whether or not your
[08:56] AML system is up to par. Like, this
[08:58] isn't it's not practical. It's not
[08:59] feasible. It's just not a thing. Um, and
[09:02] so we need need to get the law changed
[09:04] so that developers so that people
[09:05] running these kinds of wallets are
[09:07] protected so that we can have access to
[09:09] these things in the
[09:10] US. And and I mean, does this is this
[09:13] something that potentially has
[09:14] ramifications further than just like if
[09:16] an individual is listening to this and
[09:17] they're thinking, well, okay, maybe some
[09:19] companies need to worry about this.
[09:20] what's the big deal? But like this could
[09:22] conceivably this kind of precedent could
[09:24] be used to go after just like even
[09:26] individual node runners, right? Who are
[09:28] operating lightning channels with each
[09:29] other like there there's there's no
[09:31] reason like if they if they have a bone
[09:33] to pick with you, they can use this as
[09:34] an attack vector essentially. Oh,
[09:36] totally. Yeah. Especially lightning
[09:37] nodes, you know, any of these I I like
[09:40] to refer to them as ancillary services
[09:42] to non-custodial wallets. So these these
[09:44] service providers, these sequencers,
[09:46] these lightning nodes, you know,
[09:47] sometimes it's decentralized network,
[09:49] sometimes it's an individual company, um
[09:51] they can all be targeted with this kind
[09:53] of reasoning. You know, the the DOJ said
[09:56] that a frying pan transmits heat and
[09:58] thus anyone involved in transmitting any
[10:02] data for a non-custodial wallet as a
[10:04] money transmitter. Um, that was their
[10:07] argument. Yeah, that that was their
[10:09] argument in the in the filing is a a
[10:10] frying pan transmits heat and an
[10:12] Ethernet cable transmits data and thus
[10:15] everyone is a money transmitter. And
[10:16] it's like, well, if you take that to its
[10:17] logical conclusion, your ISP is a money
[10:19] transmitter because they let you use
[10:21] Bitcoin on the network, right? It's it's
[10:23] absurd how broad they wanted to define
[10:26] money transmission here. Um, and so it
[10:29] needs to be clarified. Like this is
[10:31] nonsense. I mean that that's I I'm now
[10:33] remembering this because I think there
[10:35] were jokes about like you know stainless
[10:36] steel versus cast iron pans and you know
[10:38] which was but it's just like it's it's
[10:41] just so insane like that like that
[10:43] that's like an argument that was made
[10:44] like by very serious people who can just
[10:47] literally throw you in jail. Like that's
[10:50] those are people that can come and take
[10:51] away your freedom and they're making
[10:53] arguments based on like you know [ __ ]
[10:55] heat transfer. I mean it's just it's
[10:57] just that's just nuts. It's just insane.
[10:59] You know they can maybe you end up
[11:00] winning in court. it doesn't matter. You
[11:02] still spent three years sitting in jail
[11:03] routing in a cell and no developer, no
[11:07] wallet software vendor is going to take
[11:09] that risk, right? And so, you know,
[11:11] there's a lot of Bitcoiners like, ah,
[11:12] well, we shouldn't let the government
[11:14] whatever we should take our freedoms,
[11:16] not, you know, ask the government to
[11:18] change the rules. And that's fair, but
[11:21] no one is going to take that risk for
[11:23] you, right? So, you need in order to
[11:25] have in order to use Bitcoin in a way
[11:27] that has not shitty user experience,
[11:30] right? So on Lightning, on ArcSpark,
[11:32] whatever, on any of these L2s, you need
[11:34] these ancillary services. Maybe they're
[11:37] a company, maybe it's decentralized
[11:39] network, but you need them in order for
[11:40] that wallet to function. And no one is
[11:43] going to take that risk for you because
[11:44] no one wants to sit in a jail cell. Even
[11:47] if they're confident they're going to
[11:48] win on the on the law, they're not going
[11:49] to want to sit in the jail cell. No
[11:51] developer is going to do that. No wallet
[11:52] vendor. And these things just won't be
[11:54] available to Americans.
[11:56] And like, and I cannot blame them. I
[11:58] wouldn't want to sit in a jail cell like
[12:01] for that and and not even have the you
[12:03] know the like nothing is certain once
[12:06] once your freedom is is stripped away
[12:08] and you were put behind bars. I mean
[12:09] like we just saw you know Ross Olrich
[12:12] finally made it out after so many years
[12:14] behind bars like nobody wants to be put
[12:17] in that cage and like the state does
[12:19] have that ability to uh exert violence
[12:21] on you and they will do it like but it's
[12:24] it's just the reality. So with that kind
[12:27] of dark uh dark preface to all of this
[12:31] uh what okay what's the bright side here
[12:34] in terms of this uh this blockchain
[12:35] regulatory certainty act. Yeah. So we
[12:38] have a shot here to fix the law. Um so
[12:41] two uh Congress people uh Representative
[12:44] Emmer who is the majority whip. So
[12:46] that's the number two position on the
[12:48] Republican side of the house for those
[12:49] who aren't familiar with their US
[12:52] civics. Um, and Rep. Torres, who is the
[12:56] Democrat from the Bronx, uh,
[12:58] co-introduced the Blockchain Regulatory
[13:00] Certainty Act, which fixes the law. I
[13:03] mean, it's a super straightforward
[13:04] two-page bill. You can go read it.
[13:05] Anyone can read it. It's not
[13:07] complicated. You don't need a legal
[13:08] background to understand everything in
[13:10] there. It just says if you're not a
[13:12] custodian, you're not a money
[13:13] transmitter. You're not regulated as
[13:14] such. You're not regulated as any of
[13:17] this nonsense. Um, and so we need to we
[13:20] need to put pressure on them. we need to
[13:22] call our Congress people. We need to
[13:25] say, "Look, we need this to pass." Um,
[13:29] and that means we have to work with our
[13:32] friends or more often enemies on the
[13:35] crypto side of the house, not the
[13:36] Bitcoin side. And we need to get them
[13:38] pushing it. And they are. We need to
[13:40] work with uh our friends in Congress and
[13:43] lobbyists who support us. Um, and they
[13:46] are pushing on this, too. But
[13:48] ultimately, we need the politicians to
[13:50] feel pressure from the voters. People
[13:52] need to pick up the phone and call their
[13:54] rep representatives. I know it sounds
[13:57] cliche, but it does work. Um, it takes 5
[14:01] minutes of your time. You just look, you
[14:04] go to save ourwallets.org, you type in
[14:05] your zip code, it'll pull up all the
[14:07] phone numbers for you. You know, you've
[14:08] got two senators and a house member. You
[14:10] hit all three of them. You just pick up
[14:12] the phone. and you say, "Hi, if you
[14:14] haven't heard of the Blockchain
[14:14] Regulatory Certainty Act, I think it's
[14:16] really important. It fixes some issues
[14:18] in the law where there's uh regulations
[14:22] that people cannot possibly comply with
[14:24] and they shouldn't be subject to jail
[14:26] time in exchange for not complying with
[14:28] something they can't comply with." And
[14:30] then you hang up the phone, you go about
[14:31] your day. Um, and they listen, you know,
[14:34] they they do feel they most senators and
[14:38] representatives don't have good
[14:39] information about what their
[14:41] constituents want and most of them want
[14:45] to turn their place in Congress into a
[14:48] lifetime career for better for worse.
[14:50] They want to stay there forever. And so,
[14:53] uh, if you tell them, look, you vote yes
[14:55] on this or I'm not going to vote for
[14:57] you, they do listen. if they see, you
[14:59] know, 10, 20, 30, 40 people calling in,
[15:02] they're like, "Oh, actually, a lot of
[15:04] people care about this." It doesn't take
[15:06] much because not that many people
[15:07] actually do it. Not many people pick up
[15:09] the phone and
[15:10] call. It It's It's very true. And it's
[15:12] like if they see that there are highly
[15:14] motivated people who are taking the like
[15:17] taking that five minutes even though
[15:18] it's easy. You're right. Most people
[15:20] just don't even take that step because
[15:21] there's honestly not that many things
[15:22] that most people care about enough to
[15:24] take that step. And so it's like it it
[15:28] it can actually move the needle. They
[15:30] will pay attention because honestly I
[15:32] feel that with politicians it's like
[15:34] they have so many people asking them for
[15:35] so many things all the time. They need
[15:37] to have a way to filter that. And
[15:38] usually the way to filter things is okay
[15:40] how many people are complaining about
[15:42] this? Like how big of a problem is this
[15:44] going to be for me down the road? Is
[15:46] this an economically uh important group
[15:50] of people who are also complaining about
[15:52] this? they can probably logically make
[15:54] some assumptions there. Um, so I I would
[15:57] encourage people again just to go to
[15:59] save ourwallets.org and and to check
[16:01] this out. It's a really uh nice little
[16:04] uh little site as well here, but it
[16:06] breaks it down. The bill is linked
[16:07] there. It's it's all uh pretty, as you
[16:10] said, I mean, it's a super short bill. I
[16:11] had it up here earlier, but it's like
[16:13] literally like two pages. And can So,
[16:15] can you break down just like for the
[16:17] bill? I mean, how does this actually
[16:20] protect developers though? like is this
[16:22] something that if it's if it's passed
[16:23] through, does this actually offer the
[16:24] kind of protections that are needed?
[16:26] Yeah, I mean it it really it's super
[16:28] clear and pretty comprehensive. Uh it
[16:31] says very explicitly and it has a legal
[16:34] definition of of what non-custodial
[16:36] means. Um but it's pretty good. It's
[16:37] pretty reasonable definition. I think it
[16:39] passes the smell test of what people
[16:41] understand non-custodial to mean. Um but
[16:43] it it says very explicitly if you are a
[16:46] service provider or a software developer
[16:49] and there may be one other category and
[16:51] you are non-custodial then you are not
[16:54] subject to money transmission laws. Uh
[16:57] you are not considered a money
[16:59] transmitter as defined in federal law.
[17:01] Uh and you're not a financial
[17:03] institution. So you're not regulated as
[17:05] a financial institution. I.e. you don't
[17:07] have to do all the AML KYC and stuff. um
[17:10] it doesn't protect people from
[17:12] sanctions. There's like one or two other
[17:13] things that are strict, but that you can
[17:17] actually comply with and that you know
[17:19] you hope prosecutors will be reasonable
[17:21] about, but things that you actually
[17:23] could comply with if you're like an LSP,
[17:25] you could not open channels to people in
[17:27] Iran, right? Um it'd be great if we
[17:30] didn't have that those rules, but we're
[17:33] not fixing that. Um, but it does fix
[17:36] very specifically the samurai case uh
[17:39] where they were charged with money
[17:41] transmission. They were also charged
[17:42] with money laundering, but that surge is
[17:45] harder without the transmission case.
[17:48] Um, moneyaundering is a weird thing. You
[17:50] normally have to charge someone with a
[17:52] crime and then moneyaundering on top.
[17:54] Just charging moneyaundering is is
[17:56] harder. Um,
[17:59] but for the most, you know, unless
[18:01] that's a thing you're doing and like
[18:03] running a mixer, uh, running a mixer
[18:06] might still be challenging, but
[18:07] non-custodial wallets, very
[18:09] specifically, you're not a money
[18:10] transmitter. You're not a financial
[18:12] institution. And that's really the thing
[18:14] that people are worried about. That's
[18:16] why Phoenix left the United States after
[18:18] the samurai charges. Um, and that's why
[18:23] LSPs aren't as plentiful as they should
[18:25] be. you know, we'd have a lot more
[18:26] competition for non-custodial lightning
[18:28] wallets if we had this kind of
[18:30] protection. Uh, frankly, I've looked
[18:33] into running an LSP for people. Um, not
[18:36] that I have boats of, you know, buckets
[18:38] of Bitcoin, but but enough that I could
[18:40] run an LSP, at least for developers to
[18:42] test on and whatnot. And without this,
[18:44] I'm not comfortable doing it. But with
[18:46] this, I'm very comfortable running an
[18:48] LSP.
[18:49] And and and like the the TLDDR on this
[18:52] is basically this line right here.
[18:54] You're not going to be designated as,
[18:56] you know, any of these things unless you
[18:59] have control over digital assets to
[19:01] which a user is entitled under the
[19:03] blockchain service or the software
[19:05] created, maintained, or disseminated by
[19:07] the blockchain developer or provider. So
[19:08] basically, if you're not in control of
[19:11] user funds, you're good. That's that's
[19:14] essentially what it boils down to,
[19:15] right? That's it. Yeah, that's that's
[19:17] really all it is. It's not a complicated
[19:20] bill. straightforward and it protects
[19:23] developers and wallet vendors against a
[19:26] very specific and a very real threat
[19:28] that they're worried about. If you're
[19:30] stuck spending dollars, at least stop
[19:32] earning dirty fiat rewards. Use Fold to
[19:36] earn Bitcoin on everyday purchases and
[19:38] regular expenses, groceries, bills,
[19:41] travel, home improvement. I literally
[19:43] just earned
[19:45] 2,23 sats buying a $100 Amazon gift card
[19:49] on Fold. You don't even need to use the
[19:51] Fold card itself if you don't want to.
[19:54] You can connect your favorite credit
[19:55] card and double dip with Bitcoin rewards
[19:58] on merchant offers or go allin. Make
[20:01] Fold the center of your personal
[20:03] finances. Buy, earn, save, and even get
[20:07] paid in Bitcoin with Fold. Head to the
[20:09] link in the show notes to get started
[20:11] with the ultimate savings toolkit or go
[20:14] directly to

[20:18] use.foldapp.com/r/walker and get
[20:20] yourself $10 in Bitcoin when you sign
[20:22] up. Let's talk about using Bitcoin the
[20:25] way it's meant to be used.
[20:27] Self-custodial, lightning fast, and
[20:30] ready for the real world. That's exactly
[20:32] what BitKit wallet is all about. Bitkit
[20:36] wallet is a clean, powerful Bitcoin and
[20:38] Lightning mobile wallet that gives you
[20:41] full control onchain and on Lightning.

[21:23] custodians, no compromises. Go to
[21:28] bitkit.to or search Bitkit wallet in
[21:31] your app store and start using Bitcoin
[21:34] like it's meant to be used. That's bit
[21:39] ti. If you've accepted that we're living
[21:42] through the fourth turning, then it's
[21:44] time to get yourself some Bitcoin and
[21:46] then go to bitbox.swiss/walker
[21:48] Swiss/walker and use the promo code
[21:50] Walker for 5% off the easy to use, fully
[21:53] open- source Bitcoin only Bitbox 2
[21:56] hardware wallet. Then get your Bitcoin
[21:58] off the exchange into your own
[21:59] self-custody and prepare yourself for
[22:01] the chaos that is to come. The world is
[22:04] going pretty wild right now, but Bitcoin
[22:06] is ripping and your stack will soon be
[22:08] worth a heck of a lot more in fiat value
[22:10] than it is today as every currency
[22:12] around the world hyperinflates. So now
[22:14] is the perfect time to get your security
[22:16] locked down tight with Bitbox. I really
[22:18] want to emphasize that the Bitbox O2 is
[22:20] easy as hell to use. Whether you're
[22:21] brand new to Bitcoin, it's your first
[22:23] time setting up a hardware wallet or you
[22:24] are a well seasoned psychopath. It is
[22:27] Bitcoin only and fully open source. No
[22:30] need to trust me. You can head to their
[22:31] GitHub and verify that for yourself.
[22:34] When you go to
[22:36] bitbox.swiss/walker and use the promo
[22:38] code walker, not only do you get 5% off,
[22:40] but you also help support this podcast.
[22:43] So, thank you. Yeah. I mean, and to me,
[22:47] this just seems like such a common sense
[22:49] thing. Like, and it seems that the the
[22:51] Biden DOJ was just I mean, being very
[22:55] almost just like malicious. Like, this
[22:57] was this seems like one of those cases
[22:58] where it's like we're going to make an
[22:59] example of you, so you best not do it
[23:01] again unless you want to end up like
[23:02] these guys. Totally. Yeah. I mean, it's,
[23:05] you know, there were definitely a number
[23:08] of groups within the Biden
[23:10] administration who thought that crypto
[23:13] and Bitcoin, which of course they
[23:15] considered all to be one thing, were
[23:17] bad, should be destroyed, and we should
[23:19] use anything at our disposal to do so.
[23:22] Um, you know, Gensler at the SEC,
[23:23] obviously that didn't affect Bitcoin as
[23:25] much, but here in the DOJ, they were
[23:27] really coming after Bitcoin as well. And
[23:30] we don't know what the next
[23:31] administration's going to bring. It
[23:32] might be that again, right? So, we need
[23:34] to try to frontr run it a little bit,
[23:37] keep it from happening, and we just need
[23:38] to make clear to the Senate and to our
[23:41] Congress people that this is a priority.
[23:44] Um, you know, maybe they would pass if
[23:46] it got a vote, but it's hard to get a
[23:48] vote. We have to make sure that they
[23:49] know that this is worth their very
[23:51] limited floor time to debate this, bring
[23:54] it up, and bring it to a vote either
[23:56] individually or as a part of a larger
[23:57] package. But either way, we need to all
[24:00] make sure that they they hear us.
[24:03] I think that the difficult thing that
[24:04] people need to understand too is that
[24:06] it's like precedent that is set now
[24:09] becomes a huge pain in the ass forever
[24:12] like essentially. So if if we don't like
[24:16] now is when it's easier to fight back
[24:18] against these things from a regulatory
[24:19] standpoint because it's still kind of
[24:21] like people are still figuring it out.
[24:23] Yeah. But one of the ways they figure it
[24:24] out is by setting precedent. And if all
[24:26] of this goes through kind of
[24:27] unchallenged then it's like well okay
[24:29] this is just how we treat this stuff
[24:31] now. So, you know, any of you you like
[24:34] we're just going to toss you unlicensed
[24:35] money transmitters into jail. And I
[24:37] mean, I think the frustrating thing
[24:38] about this is like as a citizen, like
[24:41] you want there to be as much innovation
[24:42] as possible, as many companies building
[24:45] cool and, you know, uh, useful products
[24:47] for you to use as possible. This kind of
[24:50] treatment of open- source developers and
[24:52] non-custodial, you know, wallet
[24:54] developers, it literally just all it
[24:56] makes them do is do what Phoenix did.
[24:57] Like, okay, we're going to leave then.
[24:59] Like, we're not going to go risk jail
[25:00] time. And I think that's like that's
[25:02] such a shame. Like that's not the
[25:03] environment we should be fostering. Like
[25:05] nobody nobody nobody wants that
[25:07] environment. No one. I mean except for
[25:09] maybe some like people suffering from a
[25:11] totalitarian temptation that they can't
[25:13] quite explain. They're like they're in
[25:14] their Elizabeth Warren phase and they're
[25:16] just like I need to suck all the freedom
[25:18] out of the room as fast as possible. I
[25:20] don't know. I don't understand. Or
[25:21] people who want to drive all the crypto
[25:24] assets and Bitcoin into custodial
[25:26] platforms so that they can be controlled
[25:28] that way. um you know this if it limits
[25:31] non-custodial platforms everyone's going
[25:33] to go to Coinbase and to your point
[25:34] earlier about you know getting the
[25:35] president right right now I think it's
[25:37] important to recognize that a lot of
[25:39] countries tend to follow the US when it
[25:41] comes to their regulatory approach so if
[25:44] the US says screw this non-custodial
[25:46] thing we're going to ban this we're
[25:48] going to make it you know really hard to
[25:49] have a a good non-custodial wallet well
[25:53] a lot of other countries are going to
[25:54] look at that and say oh look the US did
[25:57] that this makes sense we're going to do
[25:59] the same. And so it's not just the US.
[26:02] Obviously Europe's already trying that
[26:03] and they're all way down there down that
[26:06] road. Um but many other countries will
[26:09] follow what the US does here. And so if
[26:10] we take a stand and say no, no, no,
[26:12] non-custodial is fine. Custodial will
[26:14] regulate that gets monitored very
[26:17] closely, whatever. But non-custodial is
[26:19] fine, then then that will probably take
[26:22] hold across a decent portion of the
[26:24] globe.
[26:25] Yeah. I mean, I I I I hope that it does
[26:28] because again, it's so much of this
[26:30] stuff just seems like like it should be
[26:32] common sense. It seems like this
[26:34] shouldn't even be a debate. Like, of
[26:35] course, if you're not controlling any
[26:37] sort of customer funds or, you know,
[26:39] user funds, of course, you're not
[26:42] shouldn't be slapped with these
[26:43] ridiculous, you know, uh, legal
[26:45] categorizations, but apparently it's
[26:47] very non-obvious to people or they
[26:49] pretend that it's nonobvious. Either
[26:51] way, I I'm I'm curious, too. So, I mean,
[26:54] I saw just uh right before we hopped on
[26:56] here, I saw that like all of the
[26:58] different basically uh both Bitcoin and
[27:00] crypto kind of advocacy groups or, you
[27:03] know, uh policy groups have basically
[27:05] joined together to issue some some
[27:07] statements around this, which is nice to
[27:08] see like that. I mean, you know,
[27:11] granted, it's like, okay, you know,
[27:14] don't shitcoin, it's bad for you, but
[27:16] it's not like ultimately this the fact
[27:19] that these laws uh or these actions do
[27:22] affect everyone building in this space.
[27:24] At least hopefully some of that, you
[27:26] know, sweet uh sweet shitcoin money uh
[27:28] flows through the lobbying channels and
[27:30] maybe uh benefits Bitcoin in some ways.
[27:32] At least there's that, right? They spend
[27:34] a lot of money on lobbying and we we as
[27:36] Bitcoiners don't. uh and they spend a
[27:38] lot of money lobbying about the SEC and
[27:40] and securities regs and whatever and and
[27:42] we don't care about that. That doesn't
[27:43] help us. And so it's it is nice to get a
[27:45] little bit of their money and a little
[27:46] bit of the the air in the room going
[27:49] towards something that affects all of
[27:50] us, including Bitcoin.
[27:54] Yeah, it's it's it's uh a nice a nice
[27:57] change of pace versus just them trying
[27:58] to fund uh Bitcoin smear campaigns. Um
[28:02] so I mean Yeah, right. Uh, but hey, at
[28:05] least the this I mean it was I did not
[28:07] know if I was, you know, going to get to
[28:08] see the skull of Satoshi in person, but
[28:10] that was that that was pretty cool. Not
[28:12] cool that they did it and like screw
[28:14] them for it. And I will never forgive or
[28:16] forget uh because you just pre-mind all
[28:18] of your tokens out of thin air, then use
[28:19] it to fund disinformation campaigns when
[28:21] you dump on retail. But at least we got
[28:24] that cool piece of art because like
[28:26] shout out to the artist. Uh, incredible
[28:28] piece of art. Yeah, true, true. Um, and
[28:32] [ __ ] you, Brad Garlinghouse. Uh, but
[28:34] anyway, uh, but that's beside the point.
[28:36] Uh, so, okay. Is there anything else on
[28:39] this in terms of like are any kind of
[28:42] like are there deadlines people should
[28:43] be aware of? Is there anything that like
[28:45] actionable stuff? Just I I want to make
[28:46] sure we like we really drain this. If
[28:48] there's anything else you like want
[28:49] people to know on this. No, I mean, I
[28:51] think, you know, we we want to get this
[28:52] done this Congress. Obviously, you know,
[28:54] who knows what will happen in the
[28:55] midterms in another year and a half. Um,
[28:58] so, you know, we want to we want
[29:00] Congress to feel the pressure now. we
[29:01] wanted to get it done. But yeah, I mean,
[29:03] I think it's the most important thing
[29:05] happening in Bitcoin right now.
[29:06] Certainly the most important thing that
[29:08] that everyone in Bitcoin can contribute
[29:10] to by again by picking up the phone and
[29:12] calling their reps. Um, but yeah, I I
[29:16] don't uh but I think that's I think
[29:18] that's about it. Even though it's it's
[29:20] super important, it's just not a
[29:21] complicated issue, right? Which is which
[29:24] is nice. Like it's easy to wrap your
[29:26] head around. Okay. So, so that that's
[29:28] actually kind of a perfect uh a perfect
[29:30] transition here because you said this is
[29:32] like the most important thing uh
[29:34] happening right now. There are obviously
[29:36] a lot of uh a lot of debates going on uh
[29:38] within the Bitcoin community right now
[29:41] if we can call it that. Uh presumably
[29:44] then just given your last statement you
[29:45] would say that those other debates are
[29:46] not as important as this one. Uh I'm
[29:50] very curious what you think as far as
[29:52] what is the signal right now versus what
[29:54] is the noise amongst these various
[29:57] debates that are going on whether it be
[29:59] around uh filtering and this you know
[30:02] knots versus core which I think is
[30:04] somewhat of a false dichotomy uh but or
[30:06] if it's about perhaps the mo most
[30:09] important thing is sats versus bits
[30:10] verse uh verse just you know verse
[30:13] bitcoin um I don't know if to me that's
[30:16] not the most important thing I I I enjoy
[30:18] sats But also, you know, call them
[30:20] whatever you want. Label label them in
[30:22] your app however you want. What What
[30:25] else are What are people being
[30:27] distracted by versus what else should
[30:28] they maybe pay attention to a little
[30:30] bit? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think on the
[30:34] Yeah, you're right. On the on the
[30:35] filtering debate, it's a a weird
[30:36] dichotomy.
[30:38] It's it's a a 10-year-old debate now,
[30:42] probably more. Um, so I'll I'll admit
[30:44] that I'm a little tired of it. Um, I've
[30:47] I've had it a few times. I know there's
[30:49] a lot of Bitcoiners who this is their
[30:50] first go around, so they're they're
[30:52] excited by it, but I'm a little tired.
[30:55] Um, you know, yeah, I don't think I
[30:57] think a lot has been written there. I
[30:59] think Bitcoin Core uh has a PR up to put
[31:03] up a blog post uh that explains um I
[31:08] think in very clear terms their uh the
[31:12] the way the Mempool works from their
[31:14] point of view. Um, and I think it is
[31:16] super straightforward and easy to
[31:18] understand. So, when that comes out, I I
[31:19] encourage people strongly to go read
[31:20] that. Hopefully hopefully they'll post
[31:22] it in the next day or two.
[31:24] Um, and I I don't know that I I have a
[31:27] lot more to add on that debate, but
[31:28] yeah, I mean, I think it's it's such a
[31:31] distraction. Um, no amount of screaming
[31:34] about that is going to change anything.
[31:37] It's just it is what it is. Whether you
[31:39] like it or not, no amount of screaming
[31:41] is going to change it. Um and and no
[31:43] amount of Bitcoin core changes is going
[31:45] to change reality there either. Uh it
[31:47] just kind of is what it is. So So I find
[31:49] that to be quite a distraction. Um on
[31:53] bit sats and
[31:55] bitcoin I don't know man. Um
[32:02] it's I I think the ship has sailed but
[32:04] people are going to push it anyway.
[32:06] Certainly I I have always held the view
[32:09] that more experimentation in user
[32:12] experiences built around Bitcoin is
[32:14] good. That is part of our the way we
[32:19] look to achieve our mission at Spiral.
[32:22] Uh we want to
[32:23] provide software that enables people to
[32:26] build a great non-custodial wallet and
[32:28] that enables more experimentation of
[32:30] different user experiences to see what
[32:31] resonates with people and what gets
[32:33] people really using Bitcoin.
[32:36] And you know, I mean, our goal is that
[32:39] hopefully by the end of the year, if not
[32:41] the middle of next year, you will be
[32:42] able to go on Replet, ask it to build
[32:44] you a Bitcoin wallet, and it's going to
[32:45] build you a super slick non-custodial
[32:47] Bitcoin wallet that works, has instant
[32:49] payments, low fees, and is super
[32:51] reliable, and you can build whatever
[32:53] user experience you want, and then we
[32:55] can see what actually works in the
[32:57] marketplace. Um, that's that's our
[32:58] topline goal right now. So, I'm excited
[33:01] for that. Uh, but yeah, I mean I she on
[33:06] on bits and sats and whatever. I I don't
[33:09] know, man. I'm not a user experience
[33:11] person. It does seem like the
[33:13] fragmenting the user experience is only
[33:15] worse, but hey, what do I know? Yeah.
[33:18] And what about uh are there any other
[33:21] topics I mean that you think are
[33:24] again are worthy of consideration right
[33:27] now when it comes to like these these
[33:30] internal debates that that Bitcoiners
[33:32] have. I mean there's a lot going on in
[33:36] Bitcoin. I think that the debates are
[33:38] very often not the point. Like you know
[33:41] there there's always a lot of debates
[33:43] going on in Bitcoin about this or that
[33:45] or whatever. In general, I find them to
[33:48] almost always be distractions like uh
[33:51] you know certainly the block size wars
[33:53] was not a distraction. Um that was that
[33:55] was really about how to define Bitcoin
[33:57] and that there was a lot of as painful
[34:00] as it was there was a lot of value in
[34:01] having that debate and and pushing
[34:03] through those wars. Um but for the most
[34:05] part I think most debates in Bitcoin
[34:07] tend to be a distraction. Um but there
[34:09] is a lot going on in Bitcoin. There's a
[34:11] there's more developers building Bitcoin
[34:13] applications than there ever have been.
[34:15] There continues to be a very slow but
[34:18] non trivial growth in available
[34:21] resources for developers and funding for
[34:23] developers. Uh tons of new protocols and
[34:26] things coming out. Uh whether it's
[34:29] rollups and L2s, whatever you think of
[34:32] some of those going in the shitcoining
[34:33] on Bitcoin direction. Some of them going
[34:35] in the in the providing better privacy
[34:37] direction though. Uh which is cool. Or
[34:40] ARC and other new L2s that aren't
[34:42] rollout based. Plus, I think Lightning
[34:44] is finally getting good this year. Uh, I
[34:47] mentioned earlier, but I I I really
[34:49] think the non-custodial Lightning
[34:51] wallets that are going to ship in the
[34:53] middle of next year based on the work we
[34:56] do on LDK at Spiral are going to be
[34:59] really, really good. I mean, I know a
[35:00] lot of people wrote off Lightning for a
[35:02] lot of very good reasons. uh
[35:03] non-custodial lightning has sucked, but
[35:06] it's it's getting there and and we
[35:08] finally do have a lot of the pieces in
[35:10] place and will have the pieces in place
[35:12] over the next few months to to really
[35:14] make it awesome. Um so there there's
[35:18] there's a lot of really great work being
[35:20] done. It's just that a lot of the plebs
[35:24] either people who are developers or
[35:26] maybe more importantly just don't have a
[35:28] ton of time. This isn't their full-time
[35:30] job. they don't have a ton of time to to
[35:31] contribute to
[35:33] Bitcoin, don't really get to help with
[35:35] some of these things. And so, a lot of
[35:37] people want to just have debates because
[35:39] it's very understandable and it's easy
[35:40] and you can feel like you're doing
[35:42] something and not sure that you always
[35:45] are.
[35:47] Well, let's let I I' I'd love to dig
[35:49] into the lightning piece a little bit
[35:50] because again, uh that that talk you
[35:52] gave and I I'll link it in the show
[35:54] notes for people. I'm sure I can find it
[35:55] uh on on YouTube. But basically, yeah,
[35:58] Lightning's screwed, but it's not
[36:00] screwed, but it's it's it's screwed, but
[36:01] it's okay. Uh can how maybe if you could
[36:05] give the just like the highle premise
[36:06] for that talk, like what led you to give
[36:09] it? And then kind of how has your view
[36:12] of lightning either evolved or shifted
[36:14] or changed since then? Yeah. Um I I
[36:19] think when I gave that talk, oh, you
[36:21] said 2022. It was probably something
[36:22] around then. Uh I think so probably uh I
[36:26] think lightning was a little overhyped.
[36:28] There was a lot of like lightning is
[36:29] perfect. Lightning is super secure.
[36:31] You're on a node. You don't have to
[36:32] worry about it. What whatever. Um and I
[36:35] think there were a lot of very big open
[36:38] hairy questions about lightning
[36:39] including in the security model,
[36:40] including in the trust model. Um I think
[36:43] many times in that talk I told people
[36:45] like you probably should never open a
[36:46] channel with someone you don't trust. Um
[36:49] at least kind of trust. you know, you
[36:51] don't have to like think they're the the
[36:53] best person in the world, but they're at
[36:54] least not going to go to a lot of effort
[36:56] to take your money. Um, and I think
[36:59] since then, the community's come around
[37:02] the other way and now Lightning sucks.
[37:04] Lightning is broken. Lightning will
[37:05] never grow. It's just a way for
[37:07] custodial platforms to settle money. And
[37:10] then maybe it's a a way for uh other L2s
[37:13] that people actually use to settle um
[37:15] you know whether it's you're using eCash
[37:17] or Spark or ARC or whatever you're going
[37:19] to pay people over Lightning.
[37:23] Um I'm going to you know pull a little
[37:26] bit of a cliche and and pretend that my
[37:28] view hasn't shifted. I've been rock
[37:30] solid and the community was here and now
[37:32] the community is here and I'm still
[37:33] chilling in the middle.
[37:35] Um, but I think you know a lot of the
[37:38] stuff that that was in that talk too
[37:40] was here's a big problem. It's really
[37:43] hairy. We think we have a solution kind
[37:45] of right here and we have to figure it
[37:47] out and we have to go build it and it's
[37:49] a lot of work to build it. And
[37:51] now for many of them, not everything,
[37:54] but for many of those big hairy
[37:56] problems, we do have solutions and we
[37:58] have them built or almost built. Um you
[38:02] you know the the biggest one really
[38:04] being these pinning attacks. So
[38:06] Lightning has this like really weird OG
[38:09] Lightning has this really weird trust
[38:10] model where you know we're creating all
[38:13] these transactions but we're not
[38:14] broadcasting them right away. That's
[38:16] like classic lightning. We're we're
[38:17] creating these transactions. We're
[38:18] updating them all the time and then
[38:19] eventually we'll broadcast it later. The
[38:22] problem is we got to put a fee on that
[38:24] transaction. You know we're we're
[38:25] building these transactions every minute
[38:27] or whatever. We're assigning a fee and
[38:29] that fee needs to be sufficient to get
[38:31] into a block at some point in the future
[38:33] that we don't yet know. And obviously if
[38:36] you follow Bitcoin fee estimates or you
[38:38] go to Meleool uh mele.space every now
[38:40] and again you notice that the fee does
[38:42] fluctuate and sometimes the fee
[38:43] fluctuates a lot. Sometimes the fees
[38:44] spike up you know hundreds 100x over one
[38:49] day because somebody's doing something
[38:50] crazy and they put a lot of transactions
[38:52] on the chain. Uh so creating
[38:55] transactions that have a fixed fee rate
[38:57] now for inclusion in the chain some
[38:59] point later where we don't know what the
[39:01] fee rates going to be then is not a
[39:03] solvable problem. It's not just a hard
[39:04] problem it's like we can't solve it. Um,
[39:07] and over the course of the last four or
[39:12] five years, uh, Lightning has done some
[39:15] work at changing the protocol, but also
[39:17] Bitcoin Core has rethought how they deal
[39:21] with transactions in the memp pool to
[39:23] address this problem for Lightning and
[39:24] it also fixes problems for other, you
[39:26] know, related problems for other L2s.
[39:29] Um so Bitcoin Core now as of I think the
[39:33] latest release maybe the one before it
[39:35] when you take a transaction when nodes
[39:37] send transactions to each other you know
[39:38] that you're sending a transaction
[39:40] they're like okay I got this transaction
[39:41] I'm going to see if I want to put it in
[39:42] my memp pool and then relay it onwards
[39:45] now nodes are able to look at multiple
[39:48] transactions at once so a node is able
[39:50] to say hey walker you know your peer can
[39:53] say hey walker hey I've got some
[39:54] transactions for you instead of sending
[39:56] one it sends two and Now your node can
[39:59] look at those two transactions and can
[40:00] say okay I'm going to look at the
[40:03] overall fee rate of both of the
[40:05] transactions together and not just one
[40:07] at a time. Um and that lets us play fun
[40:11] games like assigning zero fee on these
[40:14] transactions in lightning that we update
[40:15] all the time and then hanging another
[40:17] transaction off of them that pays for
[40:19] them. Um and so this trans the second
[40:21] transaction can have a high fee. it pays
[40:23] for that transaction, but nodes have to
[40:24] relay them together so that nodes can
[40:27] say, "Okay, these two transactions
[40:29] together make sense, even if the first
[40:31] one didn't." Um, and that's a huge
[40:33] change. You know, as you might imagine,
[40:35] there's a a lot of parts of Bitcoin Core
[40:37] involved in looking at transactions when
[40:39] they get added to the memp pool. to be
[40:41] able to now look at buckets of
[40:43] transactions instead of singular
[40:44] transactions is was a lot of work, a lot
[40:47] of research and development. Uh, a lot
[40:49] of thinking about all kinds of crazy
[40:50] denial of service attacks, a lot of
[40:53] thinking about ways people could break
[40:54] these things. And it
[40:56] took 2 3 4 years for Bitcoin Core to
[40:59] finally conclude some of that work. Some
[41:02] of it's still ongoing. There's more work
[41:03] to be done there. Um, but you know,
[41:06] fixing these things was hard. And so I
[41:08] think the point of the talk was to point
[41:09] out like these things are hard. We might
[41:12] have solutions for some of them. Some of
[41:14] them we might not have solutions for.
[41:15] Some of them are unsolvable. Most of
[41:17] them we can fix, but there's a lot of
[41:19] work to be done. And I think now we're
[41:21] in a position where we can say, okay,
[41:23] actually we've done most of the work we
[41:25] needed to do. It's not 100% there, but
[41:28] over the next, I think 6 to 12 months,
[41:31] it's going to be mostly there. um not in
[41:34] all lightning nodes uh but certainly in
[41:37] LDK and for the folks using LDK based
[41:41] wallets those features that we needed to
[41:44] make lightning good are finally there
[41:49] which is which is great uh like the fact
[41:51] that that you like to hear your
[41:53] positivity on it is is fantastic because
[41:55] again like uh what I enjoy about you
[41:58] Matt is that you're always very
[42:00] realistic and balanced about things like
[42:02] no one would accuse you of overly hyping
[42:04] something, you know, to to put it
[42:06] mildly. Uh so so that I mean that's
[42:08] fantastic and I do think that it is
[42:11] funny now that you kind of pointed out
[42:13] like I'm remembering in kind of that
[42:15] 2022 era where it was a lot more talk
[42:18] about how great lightning was and
[42:19] lightning is like it is ready and it's
[42:21] good to go and you know it's perfect
[42:24] and and it wasn't and now it's kind of
[42:27] like you hear there's a lot of like
[42:28] lightning like doomerism now and just
[42:31] people you know trying to dunk on
[42:33] lightning
[42:34] when it from just a as a casual user of
[42:38] Lightning and of a bunch of different
[42:40] Lightning wallets in a lot of different
[42:41] contexts, it's pretty incredible now.
[42:44] And like from what you're saying, like
[42:46] it's going to get better. Like it's it's
[42:49] it's it's funny how uh how narrative
[42:52] change, I guess. But I'm I'm glad to see
[42:55] it underhyped then, I guess, currently.
[42:57] Maybe that's a good thing. A little a
[42:59] little bit less hype uh is is not going
[43:00] to be bad. Yeah. And it'll take a while
[43:03] as wallets start to adopt the newer
[43:05] technologies. I mean, I think, you know,
[43:07] over the next few months, uh, the good
[43:10] Lightning wallets are going to get
[43:11] really good, and the ones that maybe
[43:13] aren't as actively maintained or or made
[43:15] some technical decisions that are harder
[43:17] for them to to pivot are going to stay
[43:20] okay. Um, but over the next, you know,
[43:24] as they all start to catch up, it's it's
[43:27] going to be, I think, really good. I
[43:28] think the user experience is finally
[43:30] going to be great.
[43:32] and and hopefully just like more options
[43:34] because I mean for a while even like uh
[43:36] like wallet of Satoshi was such a widely
[43:38] used wallet um and then they obviously
[43:40] they were custodial wallet to clarify
[43:42] for anyone who was not familiar and they
[43:44] left they ceased oper I mean you could
[43:46] you could still access the wallet if you
[43:48] were using a VPN like you know it was
[43:50] fine but like for all intents and
[43:51] purposes they were not available to
[43:53] folks in the US uh you know because they
[43:55] were worried again about the whole money
[43:57] transmitter thing now they're coming
[43:58] back they're saying we've got a
[44:00] non-custodial option
[44:02] Um, I don't know if you have any
[44:03] thoughts on that, but just more broadly,
[44:04] it's like, okay, it's nice for people to
[44:06] have more than just like one option.
[44:08] Like, we should have a bunch of
[44:10] custodial options and a bunch of
[44:11] non-custodial options, and you should be
[44:13] able to easily uh choose like and and
[44:16] they should be and they should be nice
[44:17] experiences versus like, well, here's
[44:19] the one custodial option that we can
[44:21] still use, and oh, you can get a hold of
[44:23] this non-custodial one if you want, but
[44:25] the developers fled, so like, who knows?
[44:27] Uh, like I don't know. Feels like we're
[44:30] in a better place now for that at least.
[44:32] But you have any thoughts on the wall to
[44:34] Satoshi thing? Yeah. And I mean the the
[44:36] BRCA is needed here and and and again,
[44:38] you know, our goal on Spiral is really
[44:41] that we want everyone to be able to yolo
[44:43] a good secure non-custodial wallet with
[44:46] an LLM and Replet and just like build me
[44:49] my own non-custodial wallet and it'll be
[44:51] good. That's our goal by the middle of
[44:52] next year. That's really our goal is
[44:54] that it'll just work. It'll be great and
[44:56] we'll have real competition there. um on
[44:58] non-custod on on wallet of Satoshi
[45:01] specifically my speculation
[45:05] um and I haven't gotten this confirmed
[45:07] is that they're using Spark um which is
[45:10] Light Spark's
[45:13] new not custodial but also not
[45:17] non-custodial
[45:19] um Bitcoin L2. Um, so it's a really
[45:24] interesting product. I I think it's
[45:25] really cool. Um, and for low balances, I
[45:29] think it makes a lot of sense. Uh, for
[45:31] for a balance where you can't really
[45:32] open a non-custodial wallet, it makes a
[45:34] lot of sense. Um, but it is fully
[45:37] trusted. So, it's this really weird
[45:39] dynamic where uh you trust their server
[45:42] to delete keys. So, that you know, as
[45:45] you transact, they're deleting old keys
[45:47] and you trust them to do that. If they
[45:49] don't do that, then they can potentially
[45:51] take your money. But if they do do that,
[45:55] they're not a custodian. They don't have
[45:57] an active key on their server that
[45:59] someone could hack into, take the key,
[46:01] and then take your money, right? So,
[46:03] it's not it has a very different trust
[46:06] model in practice. So, it is in practice
[46:09] much safer, but it is still fully
[46:11] trusted. You're still trusting their
[46:12] server to do the thing correctly. And uh
[46:16] yeah, so it's it's somewhere kind of in
[46:19] the middle then. I mean, it's definitely
[46:22] not custodial because they don't have a
[46:24] key that has the money that they could
[46:25] could get hacked or whatever, but it's
[46:28] not non-custodial either because
[46:32] you don't have the key. You don't have
[46:33] the only right to your money either.
[46:36] Like it's somewhere in the middle. It's
[46:38] a weird middle ground, but it's a really
[46:40] cool middle ground. It's cool that
[46:41] people can build a middle ground and
[46:43] then on top of that, you know, I I think
[46:47] so on the spiral team, we similarly are
[46:50] looking at using Spark for some things.
[46:52] Um, and very specifically, our goal over
[46:56] the next number of months is to start
[46:58] thinking about what a wallet looks like
[47:00] when you have both a custodial or at
[47:02] least this trusted thing and a
[47:04] non-custodial option. Because, you know,
[47:06] if your wallet only has 1,000 SATs, if
[47:08] you opened a new wallet, you linked your
[47:10] Noster uh and you received a 21 SAT zap,
[47:14] you can't there's not no non-custodial
[47:17] wallet makes sense. You can't have 21
[47:19] SATs in a non-custodial wallet, even
[47:21] with an LSP. They're not going to
[47:23] allocate money into that channel. It
[47:25] doesn't make sense. Um, and so you need
[47:28] something custodial there, or at least
[47:30] trusted. And Spark is a really cool
[47:32] option because it's not really
[47:33] custodial. Um, and it doesn't have that
[47:36] really bad trust model of like they
[47:37] could get hacked and the money taken,
[47:39] but it is still fully trusted. So, we're
[47:41] not going to call it non-custodial. Um,
[47:43] and then if you get a decent balance, if
[47:46] you get, you know, 10,000 SATs or
[47:49] whatever the threshold is for you, the a
[47:52] wallet could pick a different threshold.
[47:53] Um, you open a lightning channel and you
[47:55] go to an LSP and you say, "Hey, look,
[47:56] I've already got this money. I don't
[47:58] need you to allocate any liquidity to
[48:00] me. Just open a channel to me and I'll
[48:01] put this money in my channel." Um, and
[48:04] so it it really makes for a nice wallet
[48:08] across different balances. So you don't
[48:11] have to like pick, oh, well, I'm going
[48:12] to have low balance, so I need to pick a
[48:15] custodial wallet, or oh, I'm going to
[48:17] have, you
[48:18] know, a whole Bitcoin in there, so I'm
[48:21] going to I need a non-custodial wallet
[48:23] because I don't want it to to get
[48:24] stolen. Um, it lets just one wallet
[48:27] service both roles. And okay, maybe if
[48:29] you have a,000 Bitcoin or 100 Bitcoin,
[48:32] you're not going to use this kind of
[48:33] wallet. You're hopefully have some kind
[48:35] of offline airgapped whatever. Um, but
[48:38] for a spending wallet or for a wallet
[48:40] that only has some savings, I think it
[48:42] makes a lot of sense. And as Lightning
[48:45] continues to mature and we address these
[48:47] issues that where the protocol bleeds
[48:49] into the user experience and it leads to
[48:51] a really bad user experience. as we
[48:52] address these issues, then having this
[48:56] wallet with both sides is just going to
[48:58] be super seamless. You shouldn't have to
[49:00] notice any of this because Lightning's
[49:03] going to be totally reliable on this
[49:04] side. Spark is going to be totally
[49:06] reliable on this side, and the wallet's
[49:08] going to get you the best trust model
[49:10] that makes sense given your balance at
[49:11] all times, and it's just going to work.
[49:16] I feel like I kind of glossed over uh
[49:18] something that you you mentioned earlier
[49:19] where basically you said we're like if I
[49:21] heard this correctly like 6 to 12 months
[49:23] away from like basically somebody like
[49:24] me being able to vibe code my own
[49:27] lightning wallet. Is that kind of what
[49:29] you were you were getting at basically
[49:30] like that's really cool. That's that's
[49:33] our goal. That's definitely our goal.
[49:34] And I'm I'm not going to promise 12
[49:36] months on that. I'm in 12 months I think
[49:38] we're going to be there but I'm going to
[49:41] I'm going to say 18 months just because
[49:43] things slip. Um, you know, I think we're
[49:45] going to have a really good product in
[49:48] the next 12 months. Certainly. Um,
[49:50] whether it'll be good enough for you to
[49:52] just vibe code something and have it be
[49:54] secure and robust, maybe. Certainly in
[49:57] 18 months, you know, by late summer of
[50:00] next year or fall of next year. Yeah.
[50:03] Yeah. You're going to be able to vibe
[50:04] code your own Bitcoin wallet and it's
[50:06] going to be a good wallet.
[50:08] That's wild to think about. I mean do so
[50:10] do you envision a future where it's like
[50:12] there are innumerable different you know
[50:15] wallet implementations because
[50:17] everybody's building kind of a wallet
[50:18] that works or maybe not everybody is but
[50:21] more and more people are able to build
[50:23] out a wallet that has the functionality
[50:26] and the features that they are looking
[50:27] for like specifically or or do you think
[50:29] we still do these things sort of like
[50:32] you know is it like a winner take most
[50:34] where we still kind of trend towards
[50:35] like a couple of big players I assume
[50:38] there'll be a handful of big players
[50:39] There's I mean, you know, at at some
[50:42] point there's some social value in like,
[50:45] okay, well, this is the one that a bunch
[50:47] of people reviewed the code and it's not
[50:49] going to steal your money and whatever.
[50:50] If if we really had a million of them
[50:52] and everyone was using their own, then
[50:54] half of them would steal everyone's
[50:56] money and that's it's not a great
[50:58] outcome either. Um, but aside from that,
[51:01] you know, I think yeah, I mean, there's
[51:02] going to be quite a few and I think it's
[51:05] what it's really going to do is it's
[51:06] going to enable a lot of
[51:07] experimentation. You know, if you are a
[51:09] a hardcore Bits Maxi or a SATS Maxi or
[51:12] whatever, you can go build a wallet and
[51:15] say, "Look, look at this wallet. Look
[51:17] how great the user experience is. I can
[51:20] demo it. It works. It's super slick.
[51:22] It's as slick as all the other wallets,
[51:23] but look how great this feature of the
[51:26] wallet is where I think I'm really
[51:28] delivering a better user experience."
[51:29] And then it lets people build more
[51:30] innovative things. you know, let's
[51:32] allows for more innovation to say, well,
[51:34] I I think that there should be a Bitcoin
[51:37] wallet with a built-in chat bot and you
[51:41] pay for the chatbot with Lightning or
[51:43] whatever. I mean, I know that's a a
[51:44] common example. Now, I'm not an
[51:46] entrepreneur. I don't have a million
[51:47] ideas, but we're going to really enable
[51:50] people to experiment with all kinds of
[51:52] different clever things, and that's
[51:54] going to to really unlock things in
[51:57] Bitcoin, I hope.
[51:59] Can I ask you how I don't know if I've
[52:01] uh actually heard the story and if if
[52:03] you're cool with telling how did you
[52:04] actually get into developing on Bitcoin
[52:07] in the first place. Do you mind telling
[52:09] that story? Totally. Um I was in high
[52:12] school.
[52:14] Wild. Um and Bitcoin got to the front
[52:18] page of slashdot a few times. If you're
[52:21] not old enough to know what slash dot
[52:23] is, slash do was Reddit before dig was
[52:26] Reddit. That's dig with 2G's. Um, so
[52:30] there's there's been a few of these kind
[52:31] of link sharing sites throughout history
[52:33] and slash dot was the cool one at the
[52:35] time. It was a little more tech focused.
[52:37] Bitcoin got to the front page a few
[52:38] times over the course of late 2010,
[52:40] early 2011. Um, I ended up hearing about
[52:44] Bitcoin from a podcast that I watch
[52:46] regularly, but they heard about it from
[52:47] slash dot. there was kind of a a flood
[52:49] of technologist people who got involved
[52:52] in Bitcoin all at the same time in early
[52:55] 2011 to mid 2011. Uh, and I I just found
[52:59] it fascinating. I mean, I didn't I knew
[53:01] some things. I was a high school kid. I
[53:03] didn't really know how to code. I didn't
[53:05] really know whatever.
[53:07] Um, I just kind of thought this was
[53:10] really cool. we could like build uh
[53:12] money and like send each other money
[53:14] based on purely on the software that we
[53:16] were writing and not have to trust
[53:18] anyone else. No one else was involved in
[53:20] us sending each other money and we were
[53:22] building this this money for the
[53:24] internet. I thought that was really
[53:26] really cool and I wanted to work on it
[53:28] and luckily at the time a few other
[53:31] folks got involved in Bitcoin at the
[53:33] same time who were just brilliant. I
[53:35] mean who were you know Greg Maxwell,
[53:37] Peter Willa, folks who were senior
[53:40] engineers, you know, had been had been
[53:41] doing software engineering for many many
[53:43] years and were more than happy to
[53:47] volunteer their time to teach some
[53:49] random kid like me stuff about software
[53:52] engineering. And so I learned from super
[53:54] brilliant people. I got to hang out with
[53:56] super brilliant people in IRC and work
[53:59] on a project I thought was fascinating.
[54:00] So I kept doing that through college,
[54:03] thrown blockstream out of college, did
[54:05] that for a few years, during chain code,
[54:07] now it's spiral. So I bounced around
[54:08] basically my whole career in between
[54:12] positions doing Bitcoin research lab
[54:15] kind of stuff. Just write good software
[54:16] to make Bitcoin better. I've been very
[54:20] fortunate enough to be paid to do that
[54:22] my entire
[54:23] career. I guess probably more than five
[54:26] more more than a decade now. I've been
[54:28] doing it full-time and I've been working
[54:30] on Bitcoin for almost 15 years.
[54:33] That's that's wild. Well, happy almost
[54:35] anniversary. Thank Thanks for sharing
[54:37] that. I mean, that's just that's just
[54:39] very cool. Um I mean that so you were
[54:42] not uh like you were still a very you
[54:46] were very green when it came to your
[54:47] developer skills when you first
[54:49] discovered Bitcoin and started trying to
[54:51] learn about it. Mhm. Yeah. I have one of
[54:53] the best defenses for I'm not Satoshi. I
[54:56] didn't know what a pointer was in 2011.
[54:58] So, I clearly did not write any of this
[55:00] code. That is totally impossible.
[55:03] It's, you know, it's good to have uh
[55:05] plausible deniability these days because
[55:07] it seems the Satoshi accusations really
[55:08] get uh get tossed around. They really do
[55:10] these days. Yeah. It's it's absurd.
[55:13] Well, thank you again for sharing that
[55:15] because I I I want to ask another uh
[55:18] question of you based on another one of
[55:19] your talks which was again this uh this
[55:21] pre-Trump talk that you had which was
[55:24] essentially around uh what I if I'm
[55:26] remembering correctly what you viewed as
[55:28] one of the greatest if not the greatest
[55:30] risks to Bitcoin which is minor
[55:31] centralization specifically mining pool
[55:34] centralization some of this uh you know
[55:36] uh basically we can get into the
[55:38] template side of that too but have you
[55:41] seen any improvement in that since then.
[55:44] Um, as far as I understand, the
[55:45] situation's still not very great. Where
[55:47] are you at with that? Yeah. Is is this
[55:50] still in your mind like one of the or if
[55:53] not the greatest like long-term risk to
[55:55] Bitcoin?
[55:57] Yeah. Um, it definitely is a major risk.
[56:00] It is definitely one of the biggest
[56:02] risks to Bitcoin. I think um I will say
[56:05] that we do we are starting to see little
[56:08] shoots of grass poke through the the
[56:10] dirt here. Um
[56:13] so on the the stratum so the the
[56:16] fundamental issue to set context is that
[56:20] in Bitcoin the network the thing you
[56:22] know the thing that gives Bitcoin value
[56:25] is that there's this censorship
[56:27] resistance property like you you own
[56:29] your Bitcoin. No one can take that from
[56:31] you. No one can stop you from sending
[56:34] your Bitcoin to whoever you want and it
[56:37] is your Bitcoin. You don't have to trust
[56:39] anyone else in order to use it. And
[56:42] that's great unless there's, let's say,
[56:46] two pools that control more than 51% of
[56:49] the network or three that control
[56:52] something like 70 or 80%. Right? Uh,
[56:54] which is the case today. If you combine
[56:56] AMP pool with all their proxies and then
[56:59] Foundry, it's almost more than 50%. It's
[57:02] close to 50%, sometimes a little more,
[57:03] sometimes a little less. That's not
[57:06] good. And that can potentially impact
[57:08] this censorship resistance property,
[57:09] which I think is really a major part of
[57:12] where Bitcoin gets its value.
[57:15] So what does this mean? So I it is not
[57:18] the case that this is fundamental to the
[57:21] design of a pool, right? A pool says,
[57:24] okay, we have all these miners. You're
[57:25] going to mine. We're only going to find
[57:27] a block every so often. We're going to
[57:28] split the reward of the block across all
[57:30] the miners proportional to their hash
[57:31] rate. This is a simple business. This
[57:34] does not require that they select the
[57:36] transactions that go in the block. That
[57:38] is a technical shortcut that was done
[57:40] because it's an easier way to implement
[57:42] this business, but that's not required.
[57:45] Um, and so, uh, there's been various
[57:48] proposals throughout Bitcoin's history
[57:51] to remove that requirement to say, okay,
[57:53] we have we can have a pool where, uh,
[57:56] the individual miners are selecting the
[57:58] transactions and, uh, the pool still
[58:00] does this reward splitting thing. Um, we
[58:03] now have a few pools that actually
[58:05] enable this. So, there's Ocean obviously
[58:08] very publicly, which is Luke's pool. Uh,
[58:10] they don't have any kind of real
[58:12] material hash rate to speak of. There's
[58:14] a little bit of hash rate there. Uh,
[58:16] they've invented their own protocol,
[58:17] their own proprietary protocol for this,
[58:19] uh, that other pools don't use, but it
[58:21] does enable this, and that's that's
[58:23] really good for Bitcoin
[58:24] decentralization. Uh there's also
[58:25] stratum v2 which is a slightly older
[58:28] protocol uh standard that I wrote with
[58:31] the the brains uh which is the former
[58:34] slush pool company uh CEO and CTO were
[58:37] co-authors on that. Uh they for business
[58:42] reasons don't currently allow miners to
[58:44] select their own transactions sadly at
[58:46] Brains. Uh but there's a new pool called
[58:48] demand which is launching kind of in
[58:52] beta right now which does allow
[58:54] transaction selection. Uh and then so
[58:58] these early shoots of smaller pools
[59:00] enabling this has created a little bit
[59:04] of noise within the mining community.
[59:06] I'd like to pretend that I also had a
[59:09] part in that which with my mainstage
[59:11] talk you talked about in Nashville last
[59:13] year where I really tried to hammer this
[59:14] issue home as well as some podcasts, you
[59:16] know, trying to really talk to miners
[59:18] and say this is a major issue. You need
[59:20] to you need to fix this.
[59:22] Um, and so the Astronomy 2, the software
[59:25] is is finally becoming ready and and I
[59:28] know they're talking to a number of
[59:29] pools who are hearing from some of their
[59:30] miners that they want this and so
[59:32] hopefully that starts to become an
[59:34] option at some of the larger pools and
[59:35] some of the moderate sized pools over
[59:37] the next number of months. Um, and then
[59:41] almost entirely flew under the radar,
[59:44] Bitmain announced at in Vegas at a side
[59:48] event that they were going to start
[59:50] enabling their miners to select the
[59:52] transactions in their block. Totally
[59:54] under the radar. Somehow didn't get
[59:56] picked up by almost any media in Bitcoin
[60:00] or podcast or whatever. I haven't seen
[60:01] people talking about it, but that is
[60:03] possibly the biggest announcement that
[60:05] was made in Vegas by an order of
[60:07] magnitude. Um, that's huge for
[60:10] Bitcoin. It's Bitmain. We don't know
[60:13] what protocol they're using. They
[60:14] haven't said anything. They haven't
[60:16] provided any
[60:18] details. Who knows? Maybe it's something
[60:20] they will launch in 5 years. Maybe it's
[60:22] already running. We don't have any idea
[60:24] what's going on. But they said, the fact
[60:26] that they even committed and said,
[60:28] "Look, we think this is important enough
[60:30] that we want to do this is huge."
[60:34] I did not hear about that. Clearly, I
[60:36] was uh like too too busy uh being it was
[60:41] at some side event that like I saw one
[60:43] tweet about it and that was it.
[60:46] Wow. Well, that I mean that's like if
[60:48] they follow through with that, that's
[60:49] pretty that's pretty massive though.
[60:51] Absolutely massive. Yeah. I mean it
[60:53] would take the largest Bitcoin pool by
[60:55] far and totally decentralize it. Now, of
[60:58] course, their miners have to switch
[61:00] their software stack and they have to
[61:01] start using it. But it makes that an
[61:05] option. It makes it possible to totally
[61:07] decentralize, okay, 90% decentralize one
[61:10] of the largest pools in Bitcoin or the
[61:12] largest pool in Bitcoin. That's huge.
[61:15] Do you think they're coming at that from
[61:17] an uh an altruistic perspective of we
[61:20] want Bitcoin or, you know, we want
[61:23] what's best for Bitcoin? Is there
[61:25] another potential ulterior motive? I
[61:27] mean, or is it just that, hey, look, if
[61:28] Bitcoin uh if Bitcoin pools are too
[61:31] centralized and you don't have this uh
[61:33] you know, this this uh this optionality
[61:35] here, well, ultimately that's not good
[61:37] for Bitcoin, which is not good for our
[61:38] bottom line down the road. So, hey, like
[61:40] you know, the game theory of Bitcoin
[61:41] just works out that way. Yeah. I mean, I
[61:44] don't know. I'm asking you to speculate
[61:46] here. So, you know, but like obviously
[61:48] Bitmain has a long history of making
[61:50] decisions that look to be very bad for
[61:54] Bitcoin, but good for Bitmain's bottom
[61:56] line.
[61:57] Um, so I'm not going to give them undue
[62:02] credit for suddenly having had a change
[62:04] of heart and and just wanting to do
[62:05] what's best for Bitcoin. Uh, I think
[62:08] there is now at least some nonzero
[62:11] demand from miners to enable this. um
[62:15] they might be feeling a little bit of
[62:16] heat from the competition of Ocean.
[62:19] Again, Ocean's almost no hash rate. So,
[62:22] I don't know how much they care. Um but,
[62:26] you know, maybe they have some miners
[62:27] saying like, "Hey, look, here's this
[62:29] feature. I care about this. I want to
[62:31] use it. Why are you not uh offering this
[62:34] service?" Um, I could also take credit
[62:37] and say like, "Well, look, I got up on
[62:39] the main stage in Nashville last year
[62:40] and and put up a a a multi-headed
[62:44] monster and pointed to it and said,
[62:45] "This is Bitmain and they're the evil
[62:48] monster pulling the strings." And maybe
[62:49] they said, "Oh, this is bad for our
[62:51] business if if everyone thinks we're the
[62:53] evil flying spaghetti monster or
[62:55] whatever." Or I guess the flying
[62:56] spaghetti monster is good. I don't know.
[62:57] Whatever.
[62:59] Um, so, you know, I'm going to take
[63:01] credit for it. I don't know. But it
[63:03] totally was my all my doing. Um but
[63:06] yeah, we'll we'll see what happens.
[63:07] We'll see whether their miners adopt it.
[63:09] We'll see whether they ship it, whether
[63:11] they ship Stratton B2 or some
[63:12] proprietary protocol. Who knows? But
[63:15] yeah, I mean potentially huge.
[63:19] It's that's massive. And and can you if
[63:21] you don't mind just for folks that may
[63:23] be hearing this and saying like, well,
[63:25] okay, what's the big deal anyway? Why
[63:27] does it matter that miners can can
[63:29] choose what transactions go in the
[63:31] block? Why does that like why can't the
[63:32] pool just do it? What what is the actual
[63:34] reason why that makes a difference?
[63:37] Yeah. So I I think you know we're
[63:39] talking about this censorship resistance
[63:41] property the the way Bitcoin intends to
[63:45] get or intended to always get censorship
[63:47] resistance intended to always have this
[63:49] property that you don't have to trust
[63:50] anyone else in order to be able to
[63:52] transact your Bitcoin was that hash rate
[63:56] and mining was supposed to be
[63:58] decentralized. supposed to be that there
[63:59] are a lot of miners all around the world
[64:02] and anytime you want to get your
[64:04] transaction included, you just have to
[64:05] find one that wants to mine your
[64:06] transaction. Hopefully, many do, but you
[64:09] really just have to find one with enough
[64:11] hash rate to regularly mine blocks and
[64:14] that there are enough miners who have
[64:16] enough hash rate to regularly mine
[64:18] blocks. That is not
[64:20] hard. That is not the case when the
[64:24] miners, the things who have to pick the
[64:27] transactions that go on the block, who
[64:28] you would have to go to to get your
[64:29] transaction min are the pools, not the
[64:31] miners. Mining ASIC ownership, these
[64:35] farms filled with AS6 are actually
[64:38] fairly decentralized. There are a lot of
[64:40] them owned by a lot of different
[64:42] countries, companies in a lot of
[64:44] different countries around the world.
[64:46] you know, for in for many practical
[64:49] purposes, mining is actually
[64:51] decentralized. A lot of people maybe
[64:54] don't recognize this or think that,
[64:55] well, there's these four big public
[64:57] companies in the US. Well, if you add up
[65:00] all the big public companies, public
[65:02] miners in the US, they don't actually
[65:03] have that much hash rate as a percentage
[65:05] of total hash rate uh around the world.
[65:08] There's, you know, there's a lot in
[65:09] Russia and Kazakhstan and China and like
[65:11] it's it's in it's all over the place,
[65:12] right? That's really good. is really
[65:15] great for Bitcoin. Um, but the thing
[65:19] that needs to be decentralized is this
[65:21] transaction selection is the like who do
[65:23] you have to go to to get your
[65:24] transaction mined? And today those are
[65:26] pools and pools are super centralized.
[65:28] So we we want to take that that power
[65:31] and give it to the decentralized group
[65:33] of people rather than having it be in
[65:35] the centralized group where there's only
[65:36] three or four actual companies who are
[65:38] materially competitive.
[65:45] You are totally muted right now and you
[65:48] are going to get so much [ __ ] for this
[65:49] later. This is so embarrassing. Oh my
[65:51] gosh. Uh what I was going to say is it's
[65:54] uh it is great honestly to see whatever
[65:56] Bitmain's actual motivation behind it.
[65:59] It's incredible to see them make that
[66:02] move like because again that's a it's a
[66:05] a huge huge deal. Um, and which is just
[66:09] kind of wild that this wasn't wasn't
[66:10] covered more. I blame fellow podcast
[66:13] bros like myself. We need to do better
[66:16] covering these. I I think it they like
[66:18] announced it Thursday afternoon on the
[66:21] last day of the conference when everyone
[66:22] was worn out and like I'm just going to
[66:24] go watch Ross' speech and then I'm going
[66:26] to go home and sleep off the hangover.
[66:28] Like they announced it the worst
[66:31] possible time at a side event, not even
[66:33] the main event. And yeah, it was like
[66:36] the worst announcement possible, but
[66:39] also one of the biggest.
[66:41] That's that is that is wild. Um, so on
[66:45] this is a slightly different note, but
[66:47] I'm curious where you stand on just like
[66:50] the the oification side of things
[66:53] because I think this is something that
[66:54] gets like the word oification gets
[66:55] thrown around a lot. Um, as though it's
[66:58] like this decision that is made versus
[67:01] something that's just like this natural
[67:02] progression that happens. And I'm
[67:05] curious where you think we are at in
[67:07] this progression. Maybe you disagree
[67:08] that this is like a natural uh
[67:10] progression, but like where do you think
[67:12] we are at in this? A lot of people have
[67:14] made the point like, well, Bitcoin's
[67:16] basically, you know, already effectively
[67:18] oified, like you don't get a choice in
[67:20] it. It just it just happens and maybe it
[67:22] already kind of happened. Where do you
[67:24] sit on this? Where do you think we're at
[67:26] in that? Uh is Bitcoin still going to
[67:29] change in a material way? Does Bitcoin
[67:32] still need to change in a material way?
[67:35] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I do think
[67:36] there is definitely an element of as
[67:39] Bitcoin grows
[67:41] uh it will continue to it'll be harder
[67:44] to change, changes will be less
[67:46] frequent, types of changes will be less
[67:48] major. I think that's the case. Um I I
[67:51] don't think we're there yet. Uh you
[67:54] know, Bitcoin development is still very
[67:57] small. There's still a small group of
[67:59] people who who work on Bitcoin full-time
[68:02] and contribute materially to Bitcoin
[68:04] development. It's an ever growing group
[68:06] of people, but it's still fairly small.
[68:08] Um, and I think that the community of
[68:13] people who pay a lot of attention to
[68:15] Bitcoin, who really know a lot about
[68:17] Bitcoin, who are
[68:19] deeply interested in everything that's
[68:22] happening in Bitcoin, who are, you know,
[68:24] going to pay attention to the next
[68:26] software can share an opinion and not
[68:28] just say like, ah, the developers figure
[68:30] it out. It's still a small group of
[68:31] people.
[68:33] feels like a lot of people because
[68:35] there's a lot of people screaming on on
[68:37] social media and they're very loud on
[68:40] social media, but it's still not a big
[68:41] group of people. And so I don't think
[68:43] we're very far down the oified
[68:46] direction. And I I I know there's a lot
[68:48] of people who think we are a ways down
[68:51] that direction because it feels to them
[68:54] like, well, there's no changes happening
[68:56] in Bitcoin and the changes that are
[69:01] getting proposed aren't getting adopted
[69:03] and yada yada. I I think that's just a
[69:05] consequence of developers being busy
[69:08] with other stuff. You know, I talked
[69:10] about Mempool and these big changes
[69:11] happening in Bitcoin Core. It's like,
[69:13] okay, well, developers are are busy with
[69:15] lots of other things going on. And in
[69:18] part as a consequence, they're not
[69:20] working on a lot of softworks. They're
[69:22] they're kind of look at various
[69:24] softworks proposals and like, yeah,
[69:26] okay, that that might move the needle on
[69:28] some stuff, but not a huge deal. It's
[69:31] not like fundamentally rearchitecting
[69:33] Bitcoin or fundamentally enabling new
[69:35] things. As much as some proponents
[69:37] claim, they're generally not. Um, and so
[69:41] people are like, "Okay, we'll get to
[69:43] that." And so I I think it's easy to
[69:46] read too much into the fact that there
[69:48] aren't many changes, haven't been many
[69:50] changes to Bitcoin lately. And I don't
[69:53] think people should read that much into
[69:54] that. I think, you know, we'll we'll see
[69:57] what happens, but I I don't think we
[69:59] need to read too much into that. And
[70:02] yeah, I mean, I think we'll get to an
[70:04] oification point. I hope we're not there
[70:05] yet. I don't think we're even really all
[70:08] that close to there yet. Um, but yeah.
[70:13] Do you in terms of like how you view
[70:16] Bitcoin development more broadly uh as
[70:19] it encompasses layer 2, three, whatever
[70:21] development is it what's your view on
[70:24] that in terms of where kind of like
[70:26] where does the quote uh to use a just
[70:29] buzzword innovation happen in terms of
[70:31] the user experience like it would seem
[70:33] that that happens on these you know on
[70:36] the layer 2 on the lightnings or going
[70:39] whatever layer you think this is like on
[70:40] the eCash side of things like Is that
[70:43] where you think a lot of this stuff
[70:44] happens? And maybe that's why there's
[70:46] not so much of a a an urgency behind a
[70:49] lot of these current proposed changes to
[70:51] uh to base layer. Yeah, in part um
[70:54] certainly the various layer twos, layer
[70:58] two and a halves, custodial with more
[71:00] privacy, whatever you want to call these
[71:02] various systems move a lot faster. Uh
[71:05] they can there's no said they don't have
[71:07] a whole group of different people who
[71:09] have different stakeholders who all have
[71:10] to agree to any change.
[71:12] Um, and so they they move a lot faster.
[71:15] They still move slower than we'd like.
[71:16] Lightning still is taking a long time to
[71:18] get to a point where we're happy with
[71:19] it, but they but they they move fast.
[71:24] And so that is a lot of the focus and
[71:26] that that's also a lot of the focus of
[71:28] user experience in Bitcoin. You know,
[71:29] what is where is the w you know the
[71:32] wallet of the future in 6 months, 8
[71:35] months, 18 months? What kind of wallet
[71:38] are people going to be building? Well,
[71:40] it's not an onchain wallet and no one's
[71:41] sitting down and saying, "I'm going to
[71:43] build a new onchain Bitcoin wallet for
[71:45] people to use on their phones." Okay,
[71:48] maybe some people have some like secure
[71:50] high security whatever, but that's not
[71:52] what's happening. And so the the focus
[71:53] is really on these second layer systems.
[71:55] And I think you're right that
[71:58] the but I think at the same time that's
[72:01] not to discount how much work has to
[72:03] happen in Bitcoin core on the onchain
[72:07] side of things to enable those
[72:09] There's a lot of people who would argue
[72:11] that we need various uh changes soft
[72:15] fork consensus changes to Bitcoin to
[72:17] enable some of these L2s. I don't think
[72:19] that's necessarily true, but we have
[72:22] needed for example meool policy changes
[72:24] like big overhauls to the mempool and
[72:26] bitcoin core in order to enable
[72:28] lightning to have a better security
[72:29] model and in order to enable lightning
[72:31] to have a better uh usability story.
[72:34] Those changes also help arc and other
[72:37] L2s too. So that's where a lot of the
[72:41] work in Bitcoin core has been focused.
[72:43] On the software side, you know, there
[72:45] are various proposals that would improve
[72:48] some L2s. I think the improvements to
[72:51] Lightning are moderate, but the
[72:54] improvements to other L2s like Arc are
[72:56] maybe more substantial. There's still
[72:59] usability user experience questions
[73:01] around ARC. Um but uh the with but most
[73:06] importantly people are deploying them
[73:07] now without any software changes. People
[73:10] can actually sit down and build these
[73:11] things and this gives you a much better
[73:13] story for okay as Bitcoin core finishes
[73:17] up some of its fairly large overhauls to
[73:20] the memp pool. People are deploying
[73:22] these L2s. Lightning gets good. Arc
[73:24] starts getting deployed. Spark and
[73:26] whatever else gets deployed and people
[73:28] start using these things. uh rollups
[73:31] importantly start getting deployed then
[73:34] we can see okay well how are these
[73:36] technologies being used what is the
[73:39] usability look like how are they fairing
[73:41] in the market are people interested in
[73:43] using them are they really providing
[73:44] value and then we can sit down and say
[73:48] okay here you know I think this specific
[73:52] technology would be 10x better if only
[73:56] we had this softwork and it's just not
[73:59] providing getting the value that it
[74:01] would to the ecosystem if we because we
[74:03] don't have that. But we only really
[74:05] learn that as we start to deploy things
[74:07] as we start to actually build things.
[74:09] And so I think we'll we'll get back to
[74:12] the software game. We'll get back to it.
[74:14] But we'll come into it with a lot more
[74:16] information than we have now and with a
[74:18] lot ton ton ton more information than we
[74:21] had even two years ago where a lot of
[74:23] these ideas like Spark, like BitVM
[74:27] didn't exist. And so we were kind of
[74:29] flying blind with like well we should do
[74:31] this soft fork to get this set of
[74:32] features like okay well we don't know
[74:34] how to use that now we have ideas for
[74:36] how to use it now we can sit down and
[74:38] say okay how do we actually want it to
[74:39] look because we have ideas for how to
[74:41] use it and we have these systems that
[74:43] people are actually even building and
[74:44] we're going to see how they're going to
[74:45] work
[74:47] more like practical uh versus just
[74:50] purely theoretical and saying hey this
[74:51] sounds nice like which is ult ultimately
[74:54] you're going to get more buyin from
[74:55] people if that's the case as well like
[74:57] if you're just throwing out theoretical
[74:58] ideas like nobody wants to hear about
[75:00] your theoretical idea that sounds cool
[75:02] like but if you have something in
[75:03] practice that's a different story and I
[75:05] think that was a huge reason why things
[75:08] haven't happened is they just didn't
[75:09] generate excitement because they were
[75:11] theoretical and
[75:13] even even the the the practical ideas
[75:16] that people proposed were like still too
[75:19] theoretical um and now there's like this
[75:22] real practical stuff it's like okay I
[75:24] can see this I can see how people are
[75:26] building it I can see why people are
[75:29] building it. We can see how people use
[75:30] it. And now it's like, okay, well, now
[75:34] we really should do this or that, and we
[75:36] should tweak it slightly because it
[75:37] would help this a little more and
[75:39] whatever.
[75:42] Be conscious of your uh of your time
[75:43] here, Matt. And I want to give another
[75:45] uh shout out to people that go to save
[75:48] ourwallets.org. I'm going to uh do it
[75:51] myself. I I I need I was going to try
[75:52] and get the the call made before uh we
[75:54] hopped on here, but I did not yet. But
[75:56] uh you have my word that uh the I will I
[75:59] will make my voice heard to my elected
[76:02] representatives and I would encourage
[76:04] people to do this because it's genuinely
[76:05] such a like it'll take five minutes of
[76:07] your day and if you can't spend five
[76:10] minutes to you know to do a little
[76:11] something for Bitcoin well like I don't
[76:13] know what to tell you like go use you
[76:15] just listen to an hour and a half
[76:16] podcast
[76:18] pick up the phone for five minutes you
[76:20] clearly have the time
[76:22] exact that's that's the be that's the
[76:24] best argument if you're listening to 40
[76:25] hours podcast per week. You can take
[76:27] five minutes and go uh and go call your
[76:30] elected official. And I think this is
[76:32] important too because people I think
[76:33] sometimes want to like reject the
[76:35] political establishment entirely and
[76:37] say, "Well, we just don't even need to
[76:38] pay attention to them. We don't need to
[76:39] do it." And that's fine. You can feel
[76:41] that way. But the, you know, it's like
[76:44] you may not care about politics, but
[76:45] politics cares about you. And these
[76:47] lawmakers are going to make laws that
[76:50] you do not like and do not benefit you
[76:52] and do not make you more free because
[76:54] they're, you know, laws uh if you don't
[76:57] stand up and say something. Um so in
[76:59] this case where it's a nice simple uh
[77:01] bill that just allows developers to
[77:03] actually develop without the fear of
[77:05] incarceration. I think that's something
[77:06] that everyone should be able to get
[77:08] behind. So thank you. Anything else you
[77:09] want to uh anywhere else you want to
[77:11] send people besides save ourwallets.org?
[77:14] No, that's the big one. Yeah, save
[77:15] ourwallets.org. or you can type your zip
[77:17] code. You can you can put in your email.
[77:19] You're just giving me your email. Uh we
[77:22] might send you an email. We might not
[77:23] send you an email. In fact, if nothing
[77:24] interesting happens, we won't send you
[77:26] an email. We're not going to use it to
[77:27] spam you. It's just going in database.
[77:29] Maybe we'll share it with Mailchimp or
[77:30] something. Um but hopefully they don't
[77:33] get hacked again. Hopefully. Um but just
[77:37] type in your zip code. We proxy it for
[77:39] you. We don't log anything. It's all
[77:41] it's all anonymized. You're fine. Just
[77:43] call your reps. um
[77:46] saverwallets.org. It's not complicated.
[77:48] Spend five minutes. Help Bitcoin.
[77:51] Uh it's a it's it's a great pitch. And
[77:53] also uh the website's very nice. It was
[77:55] designed by the Bitcoin design
[77:57] community. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a
[77:59] there's a whole community of people
[78:01] whose job it is now to just make Bitcoin
[78:04] look better. They're awesome. Uh one of
[78:06] the people in that community stood up,
[78:08] you know, I said like, "Hey, I think we
[78:10] need to promote this BRCA bill a little
[78:13] better." Uh, and one of them raised
[78:15] raised their hand and said like, "Yeah,
[78:17] I'm I can do that." And so they they sat
[78:19] down, designed it. They had an LLM
[78:21] actually turn it into real code. Uh,
[78:23] it's great what these things can do. And
[78:24] and yeah, now we have a website.
[78:28] I love it. Just designing it and then
[78:30] vibe coding it into existence. It's a
[78:32] beautiful thing. Well, Matt, thank you
[78:34] so much. Appreciate your time. Thanks
[78:36] for all the work that you do and looking
[78:37] forward to uh another banger of a
[78:39] presentation from you at some point.
[78:41] I'll uh I'll I'll link a couple of these
[78:42] old ones so people can check them out
[78:44] cuz they are quite good. Thanks.
