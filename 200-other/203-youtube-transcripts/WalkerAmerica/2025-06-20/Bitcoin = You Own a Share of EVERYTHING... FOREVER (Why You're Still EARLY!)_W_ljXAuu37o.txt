[00:00] I think people look at Bitcoin now and
[00:03] they, you know, maybe they just heard
[00:06] about it now. Maybe they heard about it
[00:07] years ago when it was a couple hundred,
[00:09] a couple thousand dollars. It's now a
[00:12] lot more than that. It's got a big kind
[00:14] of scary price tag attached to it. Of
[00:16] course, you can buy fractions of a
[00:17] Bitcoin. You can buy, you know, a few
[00:19] Satoshi's. You can buy, you know, a
[00:20] dollar worth of Bitcoin. But still, you
[00:23] look at this and you say, "Come on. I
[00:25] must have missed the boat." Like, this,
[00:27] you know, what is this? can't just go up
[00:29] forever. This maybe there's some other,
[00:32] you know, uh, meme coin or some other
[00:35] speculative investment that I can look
[00:36] into cuz I've missed Bitcoin. What do
[00:39] you say to those people? How do you
[00:40] convince someone that we're still early
[00:43] when they see that big, you know, big
[00:46] price shock of of how high Bitcoin has
[00:48] gone? Well, I think I think that's a
[00:51] human a human reaction. If the price was
[00:55] per Satoshi, it would still feel like a
[00:58] bargain, you know, and one Bitcoin is
[01:00] 100 million Satoshi's.
[01:02] So, you can get, you know, almost a
[01:04] thousand Satoshi's for a dollar.
[01:07] And price like that, it sounds sounds
[01:08] super cheap.
[01:11] And so, it it's just human frame of
[01:14] reference and, you know, price anchors.
[01:18] But I would say I'll tell you um a
[01:20] couple of things. The first the way I
[01:23] think about Bitcoin is
[01:28] the amount of Bitcoin that I own is I
[01:32] have a share in all future human
[01:36] economic activity forever.
[01:42] And I I have that share
[01:45] physically. I I have that share. I'm the
[01:48] only one who can control that share.
[01:51] It's actually mine. It's the only thing
[01:53] in the world that you can actually own.
[01:58] It's like buying a share in a company.
[02:00] You might own a small share of Amazon or
[02:03] Apple or or
[02:05] Strategy.
[02:06] It's just a share enforced by promises.
[02:10] You don't actually own it. There's
[02:13] nothing you can actually own
[02:16] that nobody can take off you other than
[02:18] Bitcoin.
[02:20] And so framed like that
[02:27] is absolutely still a bargain
[02:29] because
[02:31] the the penetration of the the total
[02:36] value of all the bitcoin that exists is
[02:39] circ2 trillion dollars and the total
[02:43] asset base globally is a thousand
[02:45] trillion dollars. So it's you know 0.2%
[02:50] not 22% of everything that currently
[02:52] exists.
[02:55] And so
[02:58] by buying Bitcoin, I'm owning a share of
[03:00] everything forever that I can secure my
[03:04] family's future on. I can look after my
[03:06] children, my grandchildren,
[03:08] you know, I can help the other people I
[03:10] care about. I can build build more
[03:13] businesses.
[03:15] I can help drive future value of that by
[03:18] accelerating our move to a global free
[03:20] market. And
[03:23] it's
[03:26] it's Bitcoin is going to allow us to
[03:29] unlock a human renaissance,
[03:32] that sort of level of civilizational
[03:36] change.
[03:37] But it's really just not obvious. It's
[03:40] not obvious because it's 0.2%. Most
[03:43] people still think it's worthless. And
[03:46] so we are incredibly early, absolutely
[03:50] incredibly early. And the second part of
[03:52] your question was around meme coins or
[03:56] something like this. And it comes back
[03:58] to what we talked about before and that
[03:59] people people don't have a clear sense
[04:04] as to what money is or what money should
[04:08] represent because we've been
[04:09] disassociated from it from this paper
[04:13] layer we've been using for the last 50
[04:16] odd years.
[04:19] The the money is meant to represent your
[04:21] economic energy, your economic
[04:24] contribution, the value you bring to
[04:26] somebody else, which you exchange for
[04:29] money so that you can then use that
[04:31] money in the future to to pay someone
[04:34] else for their contribution, right?
[04:36] That's meaningful to you.
[04:40] Fiat has broken that has broken that
[04:42] link. But before fiat, we had the gold
[04:45] standard.
[04:46] And on the gold standard,
[04:49] your fiat, your paper was convertible to
[04:52] gold underneath. Now, most people
[04:55] wouldn't have an issue with gold being
[04:57] considered valuable or gold being
[05:00] considered money,
[05:03] but gold has been money in the past, but
[05:06] it's just compromised because it's not
[05:08] particularly
[05:10] is not particularly useful as money.
[05:12] It's hard to carry around. It's not very
[05:14] divisible. you can't really verify
[05:16] whether it's real gold or whether it's
[05:17] tungsten or something like that very
[05:19] easily. Um, and you can't send it over
[05:22] the internet and you know, you don't
[05:25] want to get attacked with a wrench if
[05:26] you're carrying a big bag of gold. You
[05:28] know, it's there are lots of things that
[05:30] compromise the ability of gold to be
[05:32] used as money.
[05:34] But most people wouldn't question that
[05:36] it could be or would be perfectly fine
[05:39] too from a value perspective. And I
[05:43] think the link that people realize in
[05:46] their minds but perhaps haven't
[05:47] articulated is why do I think gold is
[05:50] valuable?
[05:52] And I think gold is valuable because a
[05:54] it's been valuable for a long time. Fair
[05:57] enough. But more
[06:01] more sort of deeper than that is that
[06:04] gold is hard to produce.
[06:08] It has these characteristics which are
[06:10] which make it a reasonable money like a
[06:13] compromised money but ultimately it's
[06:15] really hard to produce.
[06:18] You can't just magic it. You can't just
[06:20] print more gold. You've got to go and
[06:22] actually mine the gold. Like the gold
[06:25] exists. It's under the surface
[06:28] and there's a lot of it and it's
[06:30] infinite in the universe. But in above
[06:32] the ground, the way you produce it is by
[06:35] expending a load of energy to produce it
[06:38] or to mine it. And that's what makes it
[06:41] valuable, the combination of the energy
[06:44] expended
[06:46] and its limited supply.
[06:48] Now, once people realize, well, yes,
[06:52] almost like, yeah, of course, of course
[06:54] that's true. Okay, well, I've got
[06:57] something great for you, right? Bitcoin
[07:01] is the apex energy money. Like gold is
[07:04] just really inefficient energy money.
[07:07] You spend a lot of energy getting out of
[07:08] the ground which is a sort of proxy for
[07:11] your for your economic energy and then
[07:13] people are willing to swap whatever
[07:15] they've produced for gold which has been
[07:18] brought into existence because you
[07:19] expended your energy. Like they're one
[07:20] in the same thing, right? But it was
[07:22] just really inefficient.
[07:26] Bitcoin is the is the end state. Bitcoin
[07:30] is pure energy money.
[07:33] You have to do work to bring it into
[07:36] existence. And it's through a a global
[07:39] free market process. Everybody globally
[07:41] can compete to produce the Bitcoin.
[07:45] They can't control the way the the rate
[07:47] at which it's produced and it's fixed
[07:49] over time.
[07:51] But everyone can compete. There is proof
[07:53] of work
[07:55] to bring the money into existence
[07:58] on a free market process.
[08:01] Absolutely. That makes it valuable. It
[08:03] makes it a ton more valuable than gold.
[08:06] It's not inefficient money. It's not
[08:09] hard money with soft edges that you know
[08:11] if the price goes up they can go and dig
[08:13] more out the ground.
[08:16] It's 100% efficient energy money with a
[08:19] fixed supply forever.
[08:23] And you can send it over the internet
[08:24] and nobody can stop you sending or
[08:26] receiving it. And no one can prove you
[08:28] own it or don't own it. You can carry it
[08:30] in your head.
[08:34] I mean, it's apex money. There's nothing
[08:36] there's nothing after it. There's
[08:38] nothing. So, if you're if you've
[08:40] convinced yourself that gold has value,
[08:42] you're going to love Bitcoin once you
[08:44] connect the dots and you frame that
[08:48] against a backdrop of
[08:50] being at 0.2% of all all assets globally
[08:54] and by owning it, you own a future share
[08:57] in all human economic activity forever.
[09:00] Like, it's a pretty compelling
[09:03] case. And you and you you then balance
[09:07] that against,
[09:10] well, I can work for something someone
[09:12] else prints for free
[09:15] and I'll keep it in a bank account and
[09:16] maybe I'm allowed to use it.
[09:20] Maybe they allow me to send it to that
[09:22] person over there. Maybe. Or maybe not.
[09:25] Or maybe they'll let me take it out the
[09:26] bank. or maybe not
[09:29] with and that that's a melting ice cube
[09:31] and it's going to go to zero purchasing
[09:33] power unless I speculate with it, unless
[09:35] I spend it
[09:38] and it's making me unhealthy and it's
[09:40] making me poorer because of all the
[09:41] secondary effects and all of these
[09:43] things. Or I can opt out
[09:47] and I can own the thing they can't
[09:48] print. I can own the thing that
[09:51] everybody's going to connect the dots
[09:54] to eventually.
[09:59] It's just there's just no contest.
