--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] I'm fundamentally an optimist. I I don't
[00:02] think that collapse is inevitable. I I
[00:04] don't believe that you you need to, you
[00:06] know, do not go gentle into that good
[00:08] night. You know, rage rage against the
[00:10] dying of the light. Don't just sit back
[00:12] and say that, you know, decline is
[00:14] inevitable. We have agency. We can go
[00:16] out and I mean, your your entire nation
[00:18] is an example of this to the rest of us.
[00:20] You know, you don't need to sit back and
[00:22] let the king tell you what to do.
[00:23] Although technically in the UK, we do.
[00:25] But I was talking about this with Peter
[00:26] the last time I spoke with him. you
[00:27] know, you can start small and for me,
[00:30] Bitcoin is both a top- down movement and
[00:32] a bottom up movement. So, individual
[00:34] people realizing the government isn't
[00:36] going to come and save them and
[00:37] preserving their wealth in Bitcoin is a
[00:40] valid and valuable thing that you can
[00:42] do. But at the same time, we should also
[00:44] engage with our elected representatives
[00:46] and try and educate them to understand
[00:48] the same thing. I do have done something
[00:50] while you were speaking earlier and why
[00:52] why don't why don't our elected
[00:54] officials see this? And I think for some
[00:56] of us in the UK, the the problem is
[00:58] solely talking about Bitcoin. If you ask
[01:00] them, would you like, we have this
[01:01] sovereign debt problem. Nothing stops
[01:03] this train. We should hedge ourselves
[01:05] with this with a pristine form of
[01:07] collateral that no other country can
[01:09] debase or dilute without mentioning
[01:11] Bitcoin. They say, "Well, that sounds
[01:12] brilliant. Well, let let's get some of
[01:14] that pristine collateral." And then once
[01:16] the idea is planted, then the specifics
[01:19] kind of sold themselves.
[01:27] Greetings and salutations, my fellow
[01:29] plebs. My name is Walker and this is the
[01:31] Bitcoin podcast. Bitcoin continues to
[01:35] create new blocks every 10 minutes and
[01:37] the value of one Bitcoin is still one
[01:40] Bitcoin. If you are listening to this
[01:42] right now, remember you are still early.

[02:12] for everything else. Without further
[02:15] ado, let's get into this Bitcoin talk.
[02:24] Do you say uh do you say noster or nost?
[02:29] I'd probably go for a short ostster. But
[02:32] you know what? Given that it's notes and
[02:35] other stuff transmitted by relays. Maybe
[02:38] maybe it should be noster. That's a
[02:40] interesting question. I think I'm I'm
[02:42] one of the only few people who is still
[02:44] uh or has maybe not even still like I
[02:47] started out saying noster because I was
[02:48] like well there's there's only one s you
[02:50] know so this is this is like no like
[02:52] this this makes sense to me so it's
[02:53] noster and I've stuck with it even Carla
[02:55] has now started saying nost my own wife
[02:58] abandoning my pronunciation team but
[03:00] I've let it slide uh but yeah I'm I'm
[03:02] always curious I wasn't sure how the the
[03:04] British tongue would interpret this but
[03:06] at least your wife says nosta or nosta
[03:09] if I say it my wife immediately falls
[03:11] asleep and or maybe it's like a
[03:13] defensive mechanism. I don't know.
[03:17] You know, people people would uh would
[03:19] often ask me, oh, you know, how do I get
[03:22] my uh like my wife to be into uh into
[03:25] Bitcoin? And I'm not sure if yours is is
[03:26] uh into Bitcoin or or what the situation
[03:29] is. But people would always ask me this
[03:31] and I'm like, well, I'm not the best
[03:32] person to ask about how do you because
[03:34] like we got into it at the same time. uh
[03:36] her parents escaped communism, like her,
[03:40] you know, her dad was a computer
[03:41] scientist, like she hates the
[03:43] government. This it just you're primed
[03:45] for this, you know, and they seem like
[03:47] natural fits. They really are like, and
[03:50] so unless you're, you know, you have a
[03:52] lot of those boxes checked. I feel like
[03:53] it's perhaps not as uh not as easy. And
[03:56] I do I do uh I sympathize with people
[03:58] who have difficulty getting their
[03:59] significant others to, let's say, have
[04:01] the same amount of care. But I think
[04:03] it's also something where it's like if
[04:04] as long as one of you in the
[04:06] relationship is aware of it and taking
[04:09] care of it and saving the value of your
[04:10] time and energy in Bitcoin, well, okay,
[04:12] that's at least good enough. Like you're
[04:14] you're as a family unit you are taking
[04:16] care of. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[04:18] you're right. It's like having, you
[04:19] know, some families have one bread
[04:20] winner, some have two breadwinners.
[04:22] Exactly. You can you can just be the
[04:24] Bitcoin bread winner for your family.
[04:26] And uh you know my wife wants to talk
[04:28] about other things other than the uh the
[04:30] the collapse of the state and hard money
[04:33] and and sovereign debt defaults. You
[04:36] know you know some people like to talk
[04:37] about the other stuff and you know
[04:39] that's I can't I can't imagine why but
[04:41] uh but yeah I mean even even Carla uh
[04:44] gets gets tired of Bitcoin talk but it's
[04:46] also like you know we
[04:49] especially when we were making videos
[04:50] very consistently it's like we talked
[04:52] about Bitcoin a lot as a you know just a
[04:54] necessity. So it was like, okay, if
[04:56] we're done with this, like done making
[04:58] videos for today, like no more Bitcoin
[04:59] talk. Let's cut it off. Stop it. Stop it
[05:01] for now. And then it's like, you know,
[05:02] like don't say Bitcoin. It's like, well,
[05:03] Bitcoin just comes up naturally. So you
[05:06] can't quite help. Your videos are
[05:07] absolutely class. I do have to say I'm
[05:09] I'm I remember watching them. It's like
[05:12] two, three years ago you started a lot,
[05:16] wasn't it? It was during the pandemic.
[05:18] Let's see. I think we started making
[05:19] them in 20 like May, end of May 2021.
[05:24] So, I think it was right after like the
[05:25] first blowoff top, if I'm getting my my
[05:28] months right, like that first uh Yeah, I
[05:30] think it was IPO was the first top.
[05:33] Yeah. And then there was the second fake
[05:35] art top in October, November that year
[05:39] when it was like, oh, it's the super
[05:40] cycle for sure this time. And I I was
[05:43] very green in the space at that point,
[05:45] you know, we'd uh just been we I heard
[05:48] about Bitcoin back in like, you know,
[05:51] 2014. uh ignored it, of course, thought
[05:54] it was some stupid nerd thing. Uh heard
[05:57] about it again in 2017,
[06:00] thought I couldn't I was like, well, I
[06:01] can't afford a full Bitcoin by any
[06:03] means, so I guess I'll just buy one of
[06:04] these Litecoin things.
[06:06] I don't I still don't think Litecoin has
[06:08] recovered the price that I I managed to
[06:10] like time the the top in 2017 perfectly
[06:13] with my like one Litecoin or two
[06:15] Litecoin purchase. And it it was like
[06:16] then I was like ignored again until
[06:18] 2020. and then, oh, maybe I should
[06:20] actually spend some time and pay
[06:21] attention to this. It seems that it's
[06:23] still around. How odd. Like, I would
[06:25] have thought this would have been, you
[06:26] know, done by now. I feel like that's an
[06:28] experience for a lot of people. I I'm
[06:30] very impressed. Anyone who hears about
[06:32] Bitcoin and the very first time it just
[06:34] like it just clicks. But I think that's
[06:36] the exception, not the rule. Oh,
[06:38] absolutely. Then that that accords
[06:40] completely with my experience. I I first
[06:42] came across it in similar time to you
[06:43] actually uh like 2013 2014 when I was I
[06:47] was writing a paper on the Sriate
[06:48] banking crisis and to my shame I
[06:51] remember reading reading quite a bit
[06:53] about it and then actually laughing
[06:55] because you know the Wavos twins they
[06:57] got stiffed over by Mark Zuckerberg and
[06:59] then they put their money in Bitcoin. Oh
[07:00] haha and then it crashed how funny. Uh
[07:03] and in you know in retrospect I was a
[07:05] complete idiot but you know I'm I'm okay
[07:07] with that.
[07:09] I always feel if I if if I had bought in
[07:11] 2013, there's absolutely no way I would
[07:12] have hodddled until now. So, you know,
[07:15] absolutely I'm with you there. I think
[07:18] that the people who say like, "Oh, I
[07:19] wish I would have known about it back in
[07:21] at this time or that time, you know,
[07:22] like realistically, you wouldn't have
[07:25] held on to it. And if you did know about
[07:26] it, you probably would have, you know,
[07:28] like just knowing about it didn't mean
[07:29] you were going to pay attention to it."
[07:31] like as is evidenced by yourself and me
[07:33] and countless other people I've talked
[07:35] to basically almost everyone's Bitcoin
[07:37] story is that ignored it ignored it
[07:39] finally paid attention to it years later
[07:41] and you know are are now going to
[07:43] Bitcoin conferences and deep down the
[07:45] rabbit hole but like it takes time so
[07:47] that that's why I'm I try to lead with
[07:50] empathy when it comes to people let's
[07:54] say even politicians uh or perhaps
[07:56] especially politicians not grocking
[08:00] Bitcoin
[08:01] right away. Now, if you've had something
[08:03] explained to you many many many times in
[08:07] very detailed ways and uh and you know
[08:10] uh convincing ways by many people and
[08:12] you still choose to keep ignoring it or
[08:16] worse deriding it, that's where I have
[08:18] less sympathy. But I can I can't fault
[08:21] somebody for dismissing Bitcoin the
[08:23] first or second time that it happens to
[08:25] pop across their radar. But I mean I
[08:27] know just I I'm sure this is a a
[08:30] frustration you feel most intimately
[08:32] given that you are actively in talks
[08:35] with uh policy makers, regulators,
[08:38] uh folks in the the House of Lords and
[08:40] Commons which you know you guys have
[08:42] such nice names for things over there.
[08:43] It's it's basically it's basically the
[08:45] Senate and the House of Representatives.
[08:47] It's just different names. It's like
[08:49] it's but it I mean it basically sounds
[08:51] like it's like the house of of of rich
[08:53] and the house of poor you know is like
[08:54] kind of like what it it sounds like that
[08:56] a little bit. The actual name is worse.
[08:58] It's the lord's spiritual and temporal.
[09:01] No it's not. Is it really? It is. Yeah.
[09:03] Because originally they used you used to
[09:05] get an automatic seat in the house of
[09:06] lords by virtue of being a bishop. So
[09:09] the bishops had some seats in the house
[09:10] of lords and so they were the lord's
[09:12] spiritual and then the lord's temporal
[09:14] were a combination of the law lords. So
[09:16] when you became a senior enough judge,
[09:18] you also got a seat in the House of
[09:19] Lords as one of the law lords. And then
[09:21] you also had a combination of hereditary
[09:23] periodes and um and life periodes as
[09:27] well. It's it's very complex. Also quite
[09:30] funny from a from the perspective of a
[09:31] United States citizen that is so I I'm
[09:34] I'm always fascinated because I and I I
[09:36] love listening to uh to Peter
[09:38] McCormack's show honestly perhaps more
[09:40] so now that it's less about Bitcoin
[09:42] because I get to learn more about the UK
[09:45] and also I I I listened to his episode
[09:47] that he had with you and and I was just
[09:48] thinking the whole time I'm like is is
[09:51] Peter about to like ferment insurrection
[09:54] like pretty soon? Okay, I'm getting that
[09:57] vibe. Or maybe not insurrection, maybe
[09:59] it's revolution is a better word. I
[10:00] don't know what I'm allowed to say in
[10:01] the UK. Um, well, it's funny. I live in
[10:03] the town where Tom Payne came from. And
[10:05] obviously you you'll know of Tom Payne
[10:07] because he was he was instrumental in a
[10:09] lot of the thinking behind the American
[10:11] Revolution. And so he was fascinated by
[10:13] the French Revolution and then was was
[10:16] part of the intellectual movement that
[10:17] really drove the American Revolution.
[10:19] And actually my Twitter profile, I've
[10:21] got a quote from from Tom Payne uh on my
[10:23] on my profile. It uh it's uh I become I
[10:27] I'm going to mis I'm going to misquote
[10:29] this now, but uh it's in my banner ad. I
[10:31] become irritated at the attempt to
[10:33] govern mankind by force and fraud as if
[10:35] they were all naves and fools.
[10:38] I love that. That's up on the town hall
[10:39] in in the town where I live. And then
[10:41] obviously he came over to the United
[10:42] States and he was instrumental in the
[10:45] thinking that underlies the United
[10:47] States Constitution which is a document
[10:49] for which I have an enormous amount of
[10:50] time and respect. It's a fantastic
[10:52] creation.
[10:54] Uh an utterly extraordinary thing for
[10:57] humanity to have done. Um and I I was
[11:00] saying to I was saying to someone I met
[11:02] in Vegas actually how how much I enjoy
[11:04] visiting the United States. I always
[11:06] leave with an immense sense of optimism
[11:08] about you know despite the problems that
[11:11] the country has like all like all
[11:12] countries have it's it's fantastic to
[11:15] visit a place where there is a real
[11:17] attitude that you you can you can just
[11:19] do things
[11:21] which is one of my favorite memes. It's
[11:24] a great meme. It's a great me and you
[11:26] know honestly I I love hearing that uh
[11:29] from folks uh you know non US citizens
[11:32] you know folks from wherever it may be
[11:34] especially from our former colonizer
[11:36] it's nice to nice to hear that kind of
[11:38] thing. No hey it's we were also
[11:40] colonized I'm I'm I'm Zimbabwean South
[11:43] African originally so there you go. So I
[11:45] I really yeah I I can't hold it against
[11:48] you uh for the generational trauma from
[11:51] which I suffer. Uh but but I I think
[11:53] that it's it's such an important thing
[11:54] that many Americans
[11:57] often forget like they forget that a lot
[12:00] of the world still views America and has
[12:03] continued to as a place of hope and of
[12:06] you can just do things and a place where
[12:09] you can make, you know, carve out a life
[12:11] for yourself regardless of your
[12:12] circumstances. And I think perhaps in
[12:15] many ways that's gotten more difficult
[12:18] to do than uh depending on what you want
[12:21] to look at as you know the heyday of uh
[12:23] you know American growth and these
[12:25] things. But in other ways thanks to
[12:27] technology it's gotten uh it's gotten a
[12:29] lot easier to do. Now I think you know
[12:30] we can of course get into the fact that
[12:32] thanks to the uh monetary system it's
[12:34] made it more difficult for the average
[12:36] person to get by unequivocally
[12:39] but that doesn't preclude you from being
[12:42] able to achieve something in this
[12:44] country and there is still I think that
[12:45] sense of at least I feel it and uh
[12:48] certainly the Bitcoiners that uh that I
[12:50] talk to feel it certainly even many of
[12:51] my uh quote normie friends feel it. You
[12:55] can just do things and and you know
[12:57] America is still uh
[13:00] despite all of its faults, in my biased
[13:03] opinion, it's still the greatest country
[13:04] in the world. Now, we can we can debate
[13:07] that. Uh but it's great because it's
[13:11] ultimately an idea based on incredibly
[13:13] strong founding documents that whose
[13:15] entire purpose is to respect individual
[13:18] rights, to respect property, to respect
[13:20] speech, to respect the right to defend
[13:22] oneself. And that's incredibly
[13:24] important. And it is a rarity in this
[13:26] world to have that and to have something
[13:28] like that baked into your uh let's say
[13:31] societal fabric from its conception.
[13:33] That is rare and it's something that
[13:35] should rare. I think it's almost unique.
[13:38] Yeah. Uh I read something recently which
[13:41] struck me really quite profoundly which
[13:43] was that America it said America is the
[13:45] only society where people came together
[13:48] and decided how much power they were
[13:50] going to seed to their rulers. In almost
[13:52] every other society in human history,
[13:55] any any transfer of power from the
[13:57] rulers to the ruled had been very
[14:00] gradual. And after a long period of
[14:02] oppression in America, you you I mean,
[14:05] you know as well as I do, you genuinely
[14:07] had a fresh start. You you threw
[14:09] everything off and then you then you sat
[14:11] down and decided, all right, this is
[14:13] this is how much power we're going to
[14:14] give to the people who govern us thus
[14:15] far and no further.
[14:18] It is genuinely it it is remarkable and
[14:21] you have to look back at the the
[14:23] foresight that some of these men had and
[14:25] just marvel at it a little bit like
[14:27] especially given their age and you know
[14:29] now we look at I mean my god like it's
[14:32] it's insane. I mean like I was I don't
[14:36] know reasonably welldeveloped uh for
[14:38] that age but I was still just a I was a
[14:39] I was a [ __ ] you know like when I look
[14:42] back you know yeah like I was successful
[14:44] uh as a as a young adult but like I
[14:47] don't think I had my my [ __ ] together
[14:49] enough to be able to uh to lead a
[14:50] revolution and then draft documents
[14:53] founding documents that would stand for
[14:55] hundreds of years after the fact and be
[14:57] used as a model for what liberty can be
[15:00] like nope I definitely wasn't I'm Sorry,
[15:03] I wasn't nearly there. So, it's it's
[15:04] remarkable what they were able to do.
[15:07] Had you needed to, perhaps you I'm sure
[15:09] you would have risen to the occasion and
[15:11] you know, cometh the hour, cometh the
[15:12] man. It's it's a combination of ability
[15:15] and circumstance, isn't it? That's I
[15:18] mean, that's definitely fair. Um, I am I
[15:20] am curious, you know,
[15:23] to because I I'd be remiss if I had a,
[15:26] you know, a guest from the United
[15:29] Kingdom on my show and did not speak of
[15:32] this United Kingdom. How united is the
[15:35] kingdom right now as a starting point?
[15:38] Well, that's a very interesting
[15:39] question. I I think we are we are in a
[15:42] strange position in the UK. So, I don't
[15:44] I don't know how much how familiar you
[15:46] are with with our sort of party
[15:47] political system. Um, so I'd love to
[15:50] actually dive into it a little bit
[15:51] because
[15:53] like I I'm kind of fascinated by it and
[15:55] honestly I think it's very interesting
[15:57] to learn how other political models work
[15:59] because we're used to our Coca-Cola
[16:01] Pepsi Cola democracy here in the US. You
[16:03] know, if it's okay if you don't like
[16:04] Coke, there's Pepsi and vice versa. Um,
[16:07] that's not the case in most other places
[16:10] in the world. And I think the UK is a
[16:12] obviously a fascinating example of
[16:13] something quite different.
[16:16] If you're stuck spending dollars, at
[16:18] least stop earning dirty fiat rewards.
[16:21] Use Fold to earn Bitcoin on everyday
[16:24] purchases and regular expenses,
[16:26] groceries, bills, travel, home
[16:28] improvement. I literally just earned
[16:30] 2,203
[16:32] SATs, buying a $100 Amazon gift card on
[16:36] Fold. You don't even need to use the

[19:30] Oo. Uh well, I mean, not to give you too
[19:33] much of a history lesson, but um the I
[19:37] suppose maybe in summary, the UK is an
[19:40] interesting example of a society
[19:42] completely opposite to the one I
[19:43] described earlier. Whereas in the United
[19:44] States, you decided how much power you
[19:46] were going to give to your rulers. In
[19:47] the the UK, the the the rulers have
[19:51] pretty much had had say since let's go
[19:54] back a thousand years back to the Norman
[19:55] Conquest. Slight sidebar, one of the
[19:57] reasons we have had weird property law
[19:59] in the United Kingdom is because when
[20:01] the Norman conquest happened in 1066, uh
[20:04] William the Conqueror declared the whole
[20:06] of England and Wales, not Scotland,
[20:07] because they didn't conquer Scotland.
[20:09] They declared the whole of England and
[20:11] Wales his personal estate. So basically
[20:13] he took the whole of those two countries
[20:15] as his property. And so in the UK to
[20:18] this day if you buy a house so I I own
[20:22] my house as freehold but it's called
[20:25] freehold because the crown has dained to
[20:28] let me occupy it for as long as I or my
[20:31] heirs inherit it. And if I die in
[20:34] testate or if my children were to die
[20:36] without issue, then the title to my
[20:38] property would devolve to the crown
[20:40] because ultimately the crown owns all of
[20:42] the land in England and Wales. I love
[20:45] that expression on your face. I mean,
[20:48] it's I mean that's that's kind of
[20:49] mind-blowing. And okay, you know,
[20:51] devil's advocate. It's like in the US
[20:53] it's like, do you really own your land?
[20:55] like, yes, we have strong property laws,
[20:57] but also if you don't pay your excuse
[20:59] me, your property taxes, well, you will
[21:02] see very quickly uh that you do not
[21:04] actually have control of that property
[21:05] in a meaningful way. You you're renting
[21:07] it from the government with a little bit
[21:09] more uh a little bit more protection,
[21:12] right? But it's but ultimately again, if
[21:14] you don't pay your property taxes, they
[21:17] will come and kick in your door and they
[21:19] will drag you out. And I like I I know
[21:21] this because I have well not personal
[21:24] experience. Uh I I've heard many
[21:27] anecdotes of people who were not fond of
[21:28] paying their property taxes and it did
[21:30] not go well for them. Uh they were
[21:32] quickly removed. Yeah. Which is which is
[21:35] pretty awful. And you know, and coming
[21:37] back to what I I think is obviously a
[21:39] common theme for Bitcoiners, it's it's
[21:40] very even though you think you own the
[21:42] the house in which you live or the land
[21:44] on which on which you live, it's very
[21:46] difficult for you to maintain title to
[21:49] that unless you comply with certain
[21:50] conditions, whether those are property
[21:52] taxes or a line a chain of title or or
[21:56] so on. So even something as fundamental
[21:58] as the place where you live and and grow
[22:00] up and bring bring up your kids is not
[22:02] necessarily something that you can be
[22:05] guaranteed to own in perpetuity unless
[22:06] you tick certain boxes which again is I
[22:09] think something that not many people
[22:10] think about very deeply until it becomes
[22:12] acute. It was interesting what you were
[22:15] saying earlier about about Carla and how
[22:17] she really understands Glocks Bitcoin
[22:21] quite quickly because you know its use
[22:24] case has been obvious to her from her
[22:26] life experience. You know I I escaped
[22:28] from I I've lived in two failed states.
[22:31] I lived in Syria. I lived in Zimbabwe
[22:34] in when we left Syria we had to leave
[22:36] with 48 hours notice. We had to drop
[22:39] everything. We were thrown out of the
[22:41] country at gunpoint and put on a boat.
[22:44] Uh and we were given I I [ __ ] you not 48
[22:48] hours notice to do that. And uh that was
[22:51] pretty hairy for my parents. Uh had we
[22:54] had Bitcoin, it would have been trivial
[22:56] for us to cross the border and to get
[22:59] our property out of the country. And
[23:01] then Zimbabwe when we left we it was
[23:03] extraordinarily difficult even then in
[23:05] the late '9s to get our money out of the
[23:07] country. We sold our house. Very, no one
[23:09] wants in dollars. Very hard. There's not
[23:11] really much market outside Zimbabwe for
[23:13] Zimbabwe dollars. It may surprise you.
[23:16] Um,
[23:18] it's big market in well, you know,
[23:20] you're shocked. I can see big market
[23:22] inside Zimbabwe for for US dollars.
[23:24] Obviously, everyone likes the US dollar.
[23:26] Uh, we d we bought a car and drove it
[23:29] across the border and then sailed it
[23:31] back to the UK and then sold it. So,
[23:33] very complicated to do in the in the
[23:35] late '9s. So I think those are some of
[23:38] the reasons why despite the fact that I
[23:40] sound like a very posh bridge, I I kind
[23:42] of got the point of Bitcoin earlier than
[23:46] some of my contemporaries who have a
[23:47] similar background and worked in a
[23:49] similar field. The idea of a property
[23:51] that is absolutely yours that you can
[23:54] transfer across borders that you can you
[23:57] can hold in your head is quite
[23:58] extraordinary.
[24:00] And to to people who've had this kind of
[24:03] I was I always feel if if if we need to
[24:05] explain Bitcoin to you, you probably
[24:08] don't really need it yet. I know that
[24:10] everyone does need Bitcoin because of
[24:12] invisible threats like inflation or the
[24:15] debasement of your currency by uh by the
[24:18] currency issuer.
[24:20] in, as you were saying earlier, to be a
[24:22] bit bit empathetic to those kind of
[24:23] people. It those are less obvious
[24:26] problems to a lot of people. And
[24:28] although they're true, they're not
[24:29] necessarily apparent. If you're trying
[24:32] to cross a border in a war zone, it's
[24:33] [ __ ] apparent that you need to have
[24:35] some way of getting your money over the
[24:37] border. Otherwise, you're going to
[24:39] you're going to have nothing on the
[24:40] other side.
[24:42] So I think may maybe my point is there
[24:44] there are degrees of how apparent the
[24:46] the importance of Bitcoin is. I don't
[24:50] know if that rings. I mean maybe like a
[24:52] a Satoshi's hierarchy of needs uh so to
[24:55] speak. Yeah, you should patent that.
[24:58] Maybe. But it would feel it would feel
[25:00] wrong uh to uh to patent it or patent it
[25:03] as you say uh with Satoshi's name in
[25:06] there. You know, that would that would
[25:07] feel somehow against the the spirit. But
[25:09] I will say, you know, I can uh I can
[25:11] coin it. I I can't be the first, though.
[25:14] You ever think something and you're
[25:15] like, "That's really smart, but there's
[25:16] just no chance that somebody else hasn't
[25:18] thought of this." And, you know, a
[25:20] thousand people thought of this. No. Uh
[25:23] or watch it. There's a beautiful line in
[25:25] there when Heck, it's a it's a it's a
[25:28] play originally about uh an
[25:30] inspirational history teacher who's
[25:32] teaching this class of boys in a very
[25:33] eccentric and inspirational way, a
[25:35] little bit like the Dead Poet Society.
[25:37] Um and he's there's a wonderful line
[25:39] when he says it's incredible when you
[25:42] have an idea that you think is
[25:43] completely unique to you and then you
[25:45] read something ancient something like
[25:47] out of Shakespeare or some or something
[25:49] written by Plato and you saw that
[25:51] someone one and a half thousand years
[25:53] ago 3,000 years ago had the same idea
[25:56] and the line is it's as though a hand
[25:58] has reached out of the page and taken
[26:00] yours.
[26:02] So there's something wonderful about
[26:04] having the same idea that some someone
[26:05] else had before.
[26:07] It it it's very true. Although perhaps
[26:09] you Yeah, that's it's a much more
[26:11] positive way of looking at it. Uh that
[26:12] it's not uh about oh, you know, you're
[26:14] you're unoriginal. It's that perhaps
[26:16] some ideas are just uh are out there in
[26:18] thisformational grid waiting to be
[26:20] snatched up by a curious mind and
[26:23] perhaps yours is curious enough curious
[26:25] enough to grasp it. And then for other
[26:27] people, you just realize they go through
[26:28] life never being curious about anything.
[26:30] And that that's one of the things that
[26:32] make me really sad. Really really sad.
[26:34] And it's one of the things that annoys
[26:36] me about my friends. We were talking
[26:37] about you my wife not being interested
[26:39] that interested in Bitcoin. I find
[26:41] Bitcoin utterly fascinating and I can be
[26:44] boring about it for hours. I'm
[26:46] astonished that not everyone wants to be
[26:49] as boring as I can be. Well, you know,
[26:52] perhaps they're just not appreciative
[26:54] enough of your posh British accent
[26:55] because they also have British accents.
[26:57] So, you know, but we Americans, we hear
[26:59] the the accent of our former colonizer
[27:01] and we think like they must be saying
[27:03] something intelligent. I'm not even
[27:04] listening, but the sounds are good. I
[27:07] It's funny that I I I was asking
[27:08] actually some uh some Romanians. I was
[27:10] like, you know, so you guys obviously
[27:12] English is a second language for you.
[27:14] When you hear Americans speak or people
[27:17] from the, you know, the UK speak, do you
[27:19] think that the UK folks sound smarter?
[27:22] uh you know like just inherently because
[27:23] a lot of you know Americans have this
[27:25] weird like British language sound
[27:27] smarter thing and they're like no like
[27:30] they're just both speaking English with
[27:32] a different accent like like we speak
[27:33] with an accent. I was like okay great
[27:35] all right so it's just us Americans who
[27:37] have some again weird generational
[27:39] trauma about this somehow you guys you
[27:40] guys left some vestigages of the former
[27:43] colonialist in us. That's funny. I I
[27:46] always just assumed that you wanted me
[27:47] to play a baddy in one of your movies or
[27:50] James Bond. Sorry, I there there are
[27:52] only two alternatives available for
[27:54] people who sound like me. Yeah, that's
[27:56] fair. It's fair. And you know, if it
[27:57] makes you feel any better, I got teased
[27:59] a lot when I came cuz not many British
[28:01] people actually sound like me anymore.
[28:04] So I got I was at school in Zimbabwe
[28:06] till I was 16. Then I came back to the
[28:08] UK, went to school in Wales, which is
[28:10] where my dad grew up. And I got abused
[28:12] savagely and brutally for sounding like
[28:15] a posh pufta.
[28:17] Uh, so in Wales they sound particularly
[28:21] interesting. I think that's Yes. Yeah. I
[28:25] So I can imagine uh you were in the
[28:27] small minority there. Yes. I was also
[28:29] very small back then which I think is
[28:31] one of the reasons why I'm enormous now.
[28:34] Uh there's some deep-seated trauma going
[28:36] on there.
[28:38] I I saw your uh your this is a slight
[28:41] divergence, but speaking of you being
[28:42] massive, I saw your uh response to uh to
[28:45] Arnold Schwarzenegger and his that was
[28:49] first of all that's I can't imagine
[28:51] going through that. We don't have to uh
[28:53] like get into that at all, but just
[28:54] wanted to say like damn, that was uh
[28:58] that was really intense and uh it says a
[29:01] lot about I think who you are today
[29:03] makes a lot of sense given what you had
[29:05] to battle through if that makes sense.
[29:07] Thank thanks man. No, it's just it's a
[29:09] long time ago. I don't I honestly don't
[29:10] mind talking about if you want to spend
[29:12] like two minutes on it. I mean just just
[29:13] for context uh if anyone didn't didn't
[29:16] read it. Um, so
[29:20] uh obviously I follow Schwarzenegger and
[29:22] um I'm an enormous Schwarzenegger fan.
[29:24] Um and uh what what did he he he tweeted
[29:29] something around uh around how training
[29:32] helped him some some days he woke up and
[29:34] he felt that he he saw in black and
[29:35] white but he went to the gym and then
[29:37] every time he left he felt as though he
[29:39] was now seeing in color. It's like like
[29:40] the Wizard of Oz or uh and I tweeted
[29:43] back to him and I said, "Yeah, you know,
[29:44] I had I had this terrible experience
[29:46] when I was younger. My my parents when I
[29:49] was 21 were they were both killed in a
[29:51] car accident. Uh it was during my exams
[29:54] in second year at university.
[29:56] Um so obviously not sugar coating it,
[30:00] pretty awful experience. Uh and my
[30:03] brother and sister were 10 and 12 at the
[30:05] time. My my other sister was 18. Um, so
[30:09] we had to drop everything and uh and go
[30:13] down to they each of them were at
[30:15] boarding school at the time. So we had
[30:16] to go one f first uh first my sister
[30:20] then my brother and yeah it was hor
[30:24] literally the worst thing I've ever done
[30:25] to tell them that you know their parents
[30:27] weren't were going to weren't going to
[30:29] come back. Um
[30:33] but but it was it was it was going to be
[30:35] okay. Um, yeah, it was that was awful.
[30:39] Uh, and you know, I I I I mentioned that
[30:43] the post to Arie and then I said, you
[30:45] know, and you know, again, no, not sugar
[30:48] coating it for a long time. I was
[30:50] probably clinically depressed, I assume,
[30:52] but I I think if you have that, if you
[30:54] have a kind of responsibility,
[30:56] and we did, we my brother and sister
[30:58] were 10 and 12, so we had no choice but
[31:02] but to look after them. We we'd been
[31:04] overseas for a long time. and we'd lost
[31:05] touch with a lot of our family in the
[31:06] UK.
[31:08] Um we were sort of between homes at the
[31:11] time, so we didn't have we didn't have
[31:12] anywhere to go.
[31:14] So um the next few years was a process
[31:17] of sort of rebuilding rebuilding our
[31:19] lives, reconnecting with our family. Uh
[31:22] we moved in with my great aunt who was
[31:25] incredibly kind uh and gave the kids a
[31:28] home. I mainly stayed at university. Uh
[31:30] I was at at Cambridge at the time. uh
[31:33] Phoebe, my sister, stayed with uh sort
[31:35] of foster family. But then then we
[31:37] shared we shared responsibility for the
[31:39] for the two young kids and I said to
[31:41] Annie, you know, I I just I had no
[31:44] desire to do anything. I had no
[31:46] inclination to do anything. I but I I
[31:48] went to the gym every day and that was
[31:50] the one thing I did and you know, I just
[31:52] would go as I didn't have a choice about
[31:53] it. And then eventually over time, I
[31:56] think that that was essentially the only
[31:58] piece of my life I had any control over
[32:00] at that point. and it was incredibly
[32:03] helpful in I think rebuilding after an
[32:06] awful experience. Uh yeah, and anyway,
[32:09] so I'm an enormous fan of Anie. I have I
[32:12] have a post of him up in my my home gym
[32:14] now, the original Terminator poster, and
[32:17] then out of the blue, he like retweeted
[32:20] me at the weekend. So, I mean, obviously
[32:22] the most exciting thing to happen to me
[32:24] this week is is coming on your podcast.
[32:26] The the second most exciting thing
[32:30] is uh
[32:32] was getting a retweet from Arie. I mean,
[32:35] it's it's pretty incredible because he's
[32:36] just such an icon and and despite, you
[32:38] know, uh like, you know, he had some
[32:40] some strange takes during COVID. Uh but
[32:43] I, you know, I I still have like a huge
[32:46] amount of respect for for that guy. And
[32:49] also like I think Pumping Iron is
[32:51] probably one of the best documentaries
[32:52] ever made of just in like I've watched
[32:55] it a few times and every time afterwards
[32:56] I'm like I need to I need to hit the hit
[32:59] the weights hard after this. Like really
[33:01] really hard. I I appreciate you sharing
[33:04] that though and I I didn't mean to
[33:06] derail, but I think again it I mean
[33:08] that's a that's a really
[33:11] impossibly difficult thing to go through
[33:13] especially at that age. But to have that
[33:15] uh to know that you needed to take care
[33:16] of your your family still because you
[33:19] were the you know you're the eldest like
[33:21] I have uh an immense amount of respect
[33:24] for that and again I think it says a lot
[33:25] about who you are today and you know I
[33:27] mean clearly you feel uh uh some sense
[33:30] of responsibility for for the United
[33:33] Kingdom more broadly given like the and
[33:36] don't mind me trying to tie this in here
[33:37] but like the the work that you're doing
[33:39] right now is pretty thankless I would
[33:42] imagine from a in terms of like, yeah,
[33:44] Bitcoiners are, you know, applaud you.
[33:46] Thank you. But more broadly, it's like
[33:50] again trying to get people to pay
[33:51] attention to something that most of them
[33:54] are completely ignoring. Or you have uh
[33:56] what's what's that guy who keeps going
[33:59] around the the the brilliant maths guy
[34:01] who's talking about how everything's uh
[34:04] everything's the rich people's fault and
[34:06] he was just Yes. Guy just really rubs me
[34:10] the wrong way. He does. He's I mean I
[34:12] hate to say this I I don't tend to block
[34:14] people on on Twitter. He's or mute them.
[34:17] He's one of the few words that I have
[34:18] muted on Twitter. He became so
[34:21] unbearable. Um if anyone hasn't seen
[34:23] him, don't Google him. Don't look him
[34:25] up. Don't give him the oxygen of
[34:26] publicity. His solution to everything is
[34:28] tax taxing rich people. And uh he hates
[34:32] Bitcoin.
[34:33] Yeah. Which which I find odd, but I I
[34:35] think it comes back to your again your
[34:37] point earlier. So many people don't
[34:39] realize that they need Bitcoin and a lot
[34:43] of the a lot of the need for Bitcoin in
[34:47] complex um you know western societies
[34:50] isn't completely obvious you know about
[34:52] the rule of 72.
[34:55] No I don't think so. Oh I love this one
[34:57] of my So it's very simple. You take it's
[34:59] a mathematical equation to effectively
[35:03] work out how quickly it takes for your
[35:04] money to have in value given a
[35:06] particular rate of inflation.
[35:09] So now I do know but but can you explain
[35:12] it though for the for the folks that uh
[35:14] may be saying I have no idea what let's
[35:16] take uh the arbitrary roughly 2%
[35:19] inflation rate which is what most
[35:20] governments target. Uh so at a 2%
[35:23] inflation rate your money roughly halves
[35:25] over the course of your working life. So
[35:27] let's say you had $100 in your checking
[35:30] account when you leave college. Uh if
[35:33] you work for 35 years and retire, that
[35:35] $100 will only buy you $50 worth of
[35:37] stuff at the end of that that period,
[35:40] which over a working lifetime is kind of
[35:43] low enough for you not to hit the
[35:44] streets with your uh with your sidearm,
[35:48] but
[35:49] any higher than that and it becomes
[35:52] exponentially faster. So, you know, at
[35:54] at 10 or 11% your money halves in 7
[35:57] years and we hit 11% in the UK not so
[36:02] long ago. And in Turkey, they hit 70%.
[36:05] And in Zimbabwe, where I grew up, the
[36:08] rate of inflation actually hit a a rate
[36:10] that's so high that at its worst, no one
[36:13] actually knows what it was. It was it
[36:16] was so high and so rapid that it was
[36:17] effectively meaningless. Um, and you
[36:20] know, we left when the rate of inflation
[36:22] in Zim was 50 60%.
[36:25] I had friends who stayed and lived there
[36:28] for a much longer time than we did. And
[36:30] their parents literally had their entire
[36:31] life savings wiped out. So, let's say
[36:34] you over the course of your lifetime,
[36:35] you'd saved $200,000 in dollars that you
[36:37] thought you were going to retire on.
[36:40] By the time they came to retire, a loaf
[36:43] of bread was a trillion dollars.
[36:47] So, so your $200,000 was completely
[36:49] meaningless by that point.
[36:52] It's actually insane. And again, uh in
[36:56] the US, in the UK, sure, we've
[36:58] especially during COVID, we had some
[36:59] some pretty gnarly inflation. Uh and you
[37:04] know, of like, of course, because you
[37:05] know, in the US, they increased the
[37:07] money supply by like 40% over the course
[37:09] of a few years, you know. So, yeah. And
[37:11] it turns out if you look back it's like
[37:12] oh yeah in terms of price inflation you
[37:15] know didn't see it right away. I wonder
[37:16] why. Well because it it fed into a giant
[37:19] asset boom like there was asset
[37:21] inflation. So of course you didn't see
[37:22] it in consumer prices right away until
[37:24] the canion effect allowed it to trickle
[37:26] on down. But even in these cases okay
[37:31] you know it's not to diminish that but
[37:33] it's like compared to you know the the
[37:36] US is like the prettiest horse at the
[37:37] glue factory. Uh, again, not not mine. I
[37:40] think I'm stealing from uh from Greg
[37:42] Foss there, but but it's a good one, you
[37:44] know. It's like, yeah, it's it's at the
[37:45] glue factor, but hey, it's the it's the
[37:47] best looking horse there, you know, and
[37:49] certain places in the world, it's like I
[37:51] it's impossible for you to conceptualize
[37:54] what that looked like like what that
[37:55] looked like in, you know, Vimar,
[37:56] Germany, what that looked like in
[37:57] Zimbabwe, unless you lived it. It's
[37:59] like, you know, you can read all you
[38:01] want about it, but the people who were
[38:02] there on the ground
[38:04] just saw absolutely everything they'd
[38:06] ever worked for go.
[38:09] And I mean, they it's just so criminal
[38:12] ultimately like that's that's the worst
[38:15] kind of theft. It's stealing someone's
[38:17] life's energy, their life's economic
[38:20] energy. And I think that that's like we
[38:24] uh more fundamentally we really need to
[38:27] start, you know, calling that what it
[38:28] is. which is just it's you're stealing
[38:30] people's life. And I think that that's
[38:32] just so so messed up. And yet it happens
[38:37] again and again and every year they they
[38:40] state that their goal in most, you know,
[38:42] uh developed nations is to steal your
[38:44] life by 2% per year. Like they tell you
[38:46] that's their goal and it's actually of
[38:48] course much more than that. But it's
[38:51] wild to me. And I know I mean right now
[38:53] the so what the UK right now uh we know
[38:58] was asking about the you know is the
[38:59] United Kingdom united but more broadly I
[39:02] mean there's obviously a lot of social
[39:04] uh let's say unrest uh happening fair to
[39:07] say I mean we've got our share of it
[39:09] over here but I think you guys have a
[39:10] different flavor of it over there. Can
[39:12] you can you talk about that? I mean cost
[39:14] of living has obviously uh gotten a lot
[39:17] higher in the UK as well. I know there's
[39:20] the different winter fuel allowances and
[39:22] all this. I I also know that you, you
[39:23] know, the UK is like uh basically
[39:26] spending over a billion dollars a year
[39:28] just to have wind uh wind turbines turn
[39:30] off because the grid can't handle the
[39:32] excess, you know, load and which is a
[39:35] whole another thing we can get into. But
[39:36] like what what is happening over there
[39:38] as a as a citizen? What do you see? Do
[39:41] you see also like a light at the end of
[39:42] the tunnel? Like what is your read on
[39:44] this right now? Okay, I must apologize
[39:47] first. I got distracted earlier in in
[39:49] our terms of our weird property. I we
[39:51] we're going to talk a little bit about
[39:52] party policy in the UK. So, let me give
[39:55] you sort of on that Freddy. It's a safe
[39:57] space for tangents, by the way. So,
[40:00] you're good. Yeah, I went on a proper
[40:01] tangent there. It's like kind of
[40:03] slingshot around Jupiter out into the
[40:04] outer reaches of the solar system there.
[40:06] I'm here for it. So, we started in 1066
[40:09] with William taking the the Scotland,
[40:12] not Scotland, but Wales and England as
[40:13] his personal estate. Weird property law.
[40:16] Um and then over time the the land
[40:19] owners and the baronss and effectively
[40:22] evolved into our into our parliament. So
[40:25] um round round about in the in the the
[40:28] 1200s parliament began to parliament was
[40:31] effectively created on a remount called
[40:32] Simon de Montfort. Again close to where
[40:34] I live there was a there was a battle
[40:36] between parliamentarians and the kings
[40:39] and the king's men. So that again the
[40:41] the location where I live was
[40:43] effectively key towards effectively
[40:45] taking some power away from the king and
[40:47] giving it to the people and that
[40:48] increased gradually over time. Um by the
[40:52] time of the sort of late 1800s you had
[40:55] sort of two predominant political
[40:56] parties in the UK. You had the Tories
[40:59] who tended to be landowning gentry
[41:03] uh and they effectively evolved into the
[41:05] modern conservative party. So slightly
[41:07] right right of center and then you had
[41:09] the wigs who were kind of more left-wing
[41:12] intelligencia I suppose um and they
[41:15] evolved into the liberal party the la
[41:17] the liberal party's last big swan
[41:19] songong was around about the time of the
[41:20] first world war when David Lloyd George
[41:22] was prime minister and following the the
[41:26] first world war the there was a huge
[41:28] rise in the labor party which
[41:31] effectively represented people who
[41:32] worked in the factories people who
[41:35] didn't own the means of production ction
[41:37] but um were inspired by some of the
[41:39] thinking of KL Marx and tried to
[41:42] represent effectively the working man
[41:44] who is no longer necessarily a farm
[41:45] laborer but now perhaps a factory
[41:47] worker. So there was effectively as
[41:51] society evolved the political parties
[41:53] representing different factions of
[41:54] society evolved and where to your actual
[41:58] question where I think this is beginning
[41:59] to break down in the United Kingdom is
[42:01] that many many people here no longer
[42:03] feel that they are represented by the
[42:05] people who are supposedly representing
[42:06] them in parliament. So in the United
[42:10] Kingdom as in most advanced democracies
[42:13] we have not a direct democracy but a
[42:15] representative democracy and it's the
[42:16] same system in the United States. you
[42:18] elect a representative who is supposed
[42:20] to speak for you in Congress or speak
[42:22] for you in parliament.
[42:24] Broadly the same idea. I think a lot of
[42:28] people in the United Kingdom no longer
[42:29] feel that their concerns or their wishes
[42:32] or their desires are being represented
[42:34] by their by their political parties. And
[42:37] that's why we have such an interesting
[42:39] we're we're at such an interesting
[42:40] inflection point in the UK where we are
[42:42] seeing the rise of of other
[42:44] non-conventional parties like the reform
[42:46] party led by Nigel Farage. You you
[42:48] probably heard him speak in in Las
[42:50] Vegas. So Farage is a controversial
[42:53] figure. He was uh he was effectively
[42:56] behind the Brexit movement in the UK uh
[42:59] where the United Kingdom voted to leave
[43:00] the European Union. whether whether
[43:03] you're a supporter or an opponent of
[43:04] that it that would have enabled the
[43:07] United Kingdom to effectively have an
[43:10] opportunity to write more of its own
[43:12] laws than than previously.
[43:16] Farage remains a controversial figure
[43:18] because a good 50% of the country didn't
[43:20] vote for that and it was a it was a very
[43:22] very close vote you know 16 million
[43:24] versus 17 million so broadly 50/50 not
[43:27] dissimilar to the way the presidential
[43:28] elections go in the United States. Yeah.
[43:31] But but again I and certainly for me one
[43:34] of the interesting things looking at the
[43:36] recent US election I I think I've
[43:39] developed a bit more personal humility
[43:42] in trying to understand the point of
[43:44] view of the people who might not vote
[43:46] the way that I do. You know, a lot of my
[43:49] a lot of my friends in the United
[43:50] Kingdom will say, "Oh, God, isn't it
[43:52] terrible that that Donald Trump has been
[43:53] elected,
[43:55] but I increasingly feel that, you know,
[43:58] 50% of the of the country voted for
[44:01] Trump and he actually got a bigger he
[44:03] got a bigger majority this time than he
[44:05] did previously. So, and like I said
[44:07] earlier, the majority of the Americans
[44:10] that I've met personally, I really like.
[44:12] And it's impossible for me to think that
[44:15] 50% of a country are bad people. So how
[44:21] how do you then square that circle?
[44:24] And maybe to your curiosity point, I
[44:28] feel there's a lack of intellectual
[44:29] curiosity in simply branding people who
[44:32] who disagree with you politically as you
[44:35] know effectively non- people, which I
[44:37] think is where we've kind of got to in
[44:38] sort of partisan terms. So kind of where
[44:40] we are in political terms at the moment
[44:42] in the UK, you have everyone was angry
[44:45] with the Tories because they had I think
[44:48] you know few people would dispute this.
[44:50] They had not done a good job in the
[44:52] previous 14 years when they were in
[44:54] power. However, Labour have come into
[44:56] power and I think statistically they
[44:59] have lost popularity at a quicker rate
[45:01] than any government in recorded history
[45:03] which you know quite an achievement.
[45:05] Good for them. Well done them. Yeah.
[45:09] and and reform are gaining a lot of
[45:12] support as a result. And a lot of my
[45:17] intellectual friends who you know who
[45:19] work in the city or who work in finance
[45:21] are isn't this dreadful that you know
[45:22] reform is reform is seeing such such a
[45:26] surge in popularity
[45:28] but then as you say you know we're
[45:30] wasting a billion pounds a year on
[45:32] cailment all of our roads are falling
[45:34] apart. No one can get a doctor's
[45:36] appointment. I haven't seen a doctor for
[45:37] four years.
[45:39] It's
[45:42] uh our our country is not functioning
[45:45] and people are angry at that and they
[45:48] want something different and that's a
[45:51] very febral political atmosphere for
[45:53] anyone to operate in.
[45:56] I'm I'm curious too I mean can you
[45:58] explain a little bit uh so because it
[46:01] seems to me and from you know obviously
[46:03] I listen to uh to Peter's show still a
[46:05] lot because I first of all love his show
[46:08] um and you know was glad that he left a
[46:10] little bit of a vacancy in the Bitcoin
[46:12] podcast space uh to for me to slip into
[46:14] before that you know for old Danny
[46:16] Nolles had to come back in and revive
[46:17] what Bitcoin did but possibly have a
[46:19] rising t he's he's I love Danny um and
[46:23] I'm glad he is crushing it uh because we
[46:24] need more Bitcoin podcasts, not less.
[46:26] Uh, but I digress. The point being it to
[46:29] me it sounds like both of the the
[46:32] conservatives and you know like the
[46:34] let's say the liberals are obviously you
[46:36] know liberal leftist but it sounds like
[46:38] your conservatives have also drifted
[46:40] quite quite left in many ways in a sense
[46:43] in not too dissimilar away from how
[46:46] things have happened in America where
[46:47] what's the one tie that binds the you
[46:50] know the the two clashing sides? Well,
[46:52] they both continue to vote for more of
[46:54] your tax dollars to be spent. They both
[46:56] continue to vote for more money to be
[46:59] printed effectively by running massive
[47:01] budget deficits. They both continue to
[47:04] basically not do anything meaningful to
[47:06] try and shrink the size of government or
[47:08] improve individual liberties at a
[47:10] fundamental level. And they both
[47:12] continue to basically engage of a in a
[47:14] game of cankicking down the road, which
[47:16] doesn't really seem to benefit the
[47:18] people that much. So is uh you know is
[47:21] reform coming in like is this a I mean
[47:25] from the people I've talked to because I
[47:26] have some friends in the UK as well like
[47:28] this seems like a real legitimate third
[47:31] you know kind of this uh this other part
[47:33] that's really coming in with some
[47:34] strength and getting some actual backing
[47:37] from them like is that the vibe that
[47:39] you're feeling as well? I think it is
[47:42] and I think it's very much
[47:43] underestimated by the political
[47:45] establishment. So most if you read many
[47:48] of the newspapers and the prevailing
[47:51] I I suppose right think in the United
[47:53] Kingdom it would be that reform is
[47:56] easily to be dismissed and it's
[47:58] impossible for them ever to form a
[48:00] serious government. I think that
[48:02] underestimates what is going on. But
[48:05] again trying to think yourself into the
[48:07] shoes of of the other side and you know
[48:10] you I'm sure you do this with Bitcoin as
[48:11] well. I I I quiz myself a lot. Why don't
[48:13] my friends understand what's going on?
[48:16] Why don't they do this? And it's it's a
[48:19] f I mean, on the one hand, it's very
[48:23] frustrating, but on the other hand, it's
[48:24] it's really interesting to try and think
[48:25] your way into someone else's head. And I
[48:29] suspect it's because the magnitude of
[48:31] acknowledging what perhaps might be
[48:33] happening, it's just too great. So, it
[48:35] becomes almost like a religious
[48:36] position. So your effectively your
[48:39] religion but your religion is that the
[48:41] government of the United Kingdom is
[48:43] either going to be Labor or Conservative
[48:44] and it can't be any of the others. But
[48:47] you forget that like like I said earlier
[48:49] David Lloyd George was a liberal and at
[48:51] that time it was the Tories and the
[48:52] Liberals and the Labour Party then came
[48:54] out of nowhere in the 1920s 1910s and
[48:57] 1920s and then it became the second
[49:00] force in in in British politics and the
[49:03] Liberal Party effectively disappeared to
[49:05] a to a small rump. They didn't hold
[49:07] power again until 2010. It was almost a
[49:09] century and that was only in coalition.
[49:13] That's wild. So yeah, it's mad. But it
[49:15] so it's it's always interesting and I
[49:18] think educational to look back and
[49:19] understand that you you actually Douglas
[49:23] Adams segueing again slightly. Douglas
[49:25] Adams made an interesting point you
[49:27] comparing this to to technological
[49:29] advancement. You always assume that the
[49:31] world into which you were born is a
[49:33] normal world, don't you? So Adam said
[49:36] that um in terms of technology, anything
[49:39] that already exists when you're born is
[49:41] normal. Anything invented between when
[49:43] you're 15 and 30 is really exciting and
[49:45] you can get a career in it. Anything
[49:47] invented after you're 40 is wrong and
[49:49] against the natural order of things.
[49:52] So
[49:54] I mean that pretty well breaks down a
[49:57] like that's a good lens a good kind of
[49:59] heristic to understand how why people
[50:02] react the way that they do to things
[50:03] like you know something like Bitcoin or
[50:05] or to anything. I mean you know it's
[50:07] it's the same like you look at the way
[50:08] that uh the older generations treated
[50:11] social media. I always think it's funny
[50:13] I remember you know a lot of the boomer
[50:14] generation you know the Facebooks are
[50:16] going to you know melt your brains and
[50:18] turn you into god knows only what. And
[50:20] now it's like who are the only people
[50:21] like left on Facebook at least in the
[50:23] US? Well, it's primarily the boomers.
[50:24] Like which is just somehow hilarious to
[50:27] me. It's like they were the ones who
[50:28] were decrying it the most and now
[50:30] they're the only ones left there being
[50:32] confused about an AI generated Jesus
[50:34] riding a rhinoceros and thinking it's
[50:35] like a real photo or something. Like
[50:37] it's it's mind-blowing. I mean that
[50:39] sounds awesome. I haven't seen that, but
[50:41] that sounds really It does. It does. I
[50:43] I'll generate one after this. Put it out
[50:45] there for the boomers and see how many I
[50:47] can uh I can trick with it. Oh,
[50:50] but okay. So, so this is a legitimate
[50:53] kind of a legitimate political movement
[50:55] that's happening. You think they're
[50:56] garnering significant support. Is the to
[50:59] bring us around to Bitcoin a little bit
[51:00] too. Is the reform party obviously I
[51:03] mean, you know, you got Faraj speaking
[51:04] at the Bitcoin conference. Uh are they
[51:07] more pro- Bitcoin than the establishment
[51:09] parties? Is that fair to say? I'd say
[51:12] yes. you know, ahead of this this chat,
[51:14] I was thinking about some of the
[51:15] differences between the US position on
[51:18] Bitcoin and the UK position on Bitcoin.
[51:20] And one of the key differentiating
[51:21] factors is that until recently, we have
[51:23] had no political support in the United
[51:25] Kingdom for Bitcoin at all. So, in the
[51:28] United States, you've got you've got
[51:30] interesting cross party support
[51:31] actually, you know, from Senator Lumis,
[51:33] everyone knows about Senator Gillibrand.
[51:35] The Lamus Gillibrand bill, which was
[51:36] drafted before the election, was
[51:38] actually a good piece of legislation.
[51:39] and I read it at the time and I thought
[51:41] that was a useful step forward. We've
[51:43] got represent, you know, people like Tom
[51:44] Emma,
[51:46] you have Cory Booker, Eric Adams, you
[51:49] have people from both sides of the aisle
[51:50] who I think are beginning to understand
[51:52] how important Bitcoin is and the
[51:54] strategic importance that it holds for,
[51:57] you know, for a nation wanting to have a
[51:59] secure monetary foundation and monetary
[52:01] future in a rapidly changing world,
[52:05] which is effectively a low trust world.
[52:08] The United Kingdom basically has its
[52:10] pants down and its its its head in the
[52:13] sand both at the same time waiting to be
[52:15] taken from behind by some country that
[52:17] understands Bitcoin better. That's a
[52:20] horrible image and I wish I hadn't said
[52:21] that but that I mean sorry that that
[52:25] that that came unbidden to my mind that
[52:27] that probably indicates some of the
[52:29] deep-seated psychological issues that I
[52:30] have. No, that's okay. That's okay. It's
[52:32] a safe space here. Okay.
[52:36] Yeah. Well, um, so it's interesting you
[52:39] ask about what reform were doing
[52:40] differently. So the the thing that Nigel
[52:43] Farage and Vegas was, I think, as as
[52:48] seinal as the executive order from from
[52:51] Donald Trump's administration
[52:53] um, establishing the strategic Bitcoin
[52:55] reserve, which I have to say I was
[52:57] astonished to read at the the quality of
[53:00] the drafting and that document was was
[53:02] amazing. There a lot of work had done
[53:04] into it. I I had I was not expecting
[53:06] there to be such a clear differentiation
[53:08] between Bitcoin and other crypto assets.
[53:11] I thought it was going to be a just a
[53:13] conglomeration of of all of the
[53:15] shitcoins plus Bitcoin, but there was a
[53:17] clear divide there between Bitcoin in a
[53:18] reserve. Everything else in the
[53:20] stockpile, we're going to use the
[53:21] stockpile. We're going to keep the
[53:23] reserve. Fantastic. The Farage bill was
[53:26] really interesting. So, I did a I did a
[53:29] sort of quickfire interview on this with
[53:30] the Institute of Economic Affairs just
[53:32] after it was published. Um, and I've
[53:34] pulled it up on my second screen here.
[53:37] So, I think they hit some really
[53:38] interesting points. So, they want to
[53:41] reduce capital gains on on
[53:43] cryptocurrency sales, which is a, you
[53:45] know, a key blocker in terms of using it
[53:47] as money. At the moment, in the UK and I
[53:49] think in the US as well, every
[53:51] transaction is is essentially a a
[53:53] chargeable event, which slows the
[53:56] velocity of money. It's insane, isn't
[53:58] it? Yeah. And you know there are already
[54:00] countries like Germany and like the
[54:02] Czech Republic uh who recognize that if
[54:05] you if you there's been a holding period
[54:06] then any use of it as money thereafter
[54:09] should be exempt from CGT. Uh that
[54:11] actually the Lamus Gillbrand bill that I
[54:13] mentioned before took a really
[54:14] interesting perspective which I think
[54:16] they had a $200 day minimus amount. Yep.
[54:19] Y yeah. So in other words, you know, you
[54:21] buy coffee, you buy food. Yeah. Yeah.
[54:24] Doesn't matter. No CGT. Um the banking
[54:27] non-discrimination big one in the reform
[54:29] bill. Um we've seen a lot of business a
[54:32] lot of Bitcoin businesses in the UK um
[54:35] being refused uh refused banking.
[54:37] Actually funny we mentioned this just
[54:39] before this call. Um obviously I run
[54:42] Bitcoin Policy UK with with with Susie
[54:45] who's who's a CEO and my co-founder.
[54:47] We've been applying for a second bank
[54:48] account because the bank that we
[54:50] currently bank with was threatened to
[54:52] close our account and the second bank
[54:54] that we've we've spoken to has just said
[54:56] that they will not bank us. They've not
[54:58] given any reasons.
[55:00] Uh
[55:02] but we suspect because of what we do.
[55:05] But that is that is just in insane like
[55:07] you're a you're a you know a policy
[55:10] institute. Like it's a it's a it's a
[55:11] think tank. Are you guys a you're a
[55:14] nonprofit over there? I'm not sure.
[55:16] Okay. So same same as like the uh
[55:18] Bitcoin policy institute in the in the
[55:20] US here but they they deem that you are
[55:23] somehow uh too risky to bank essentially
[55:26] they they they won't give us any reasons
[55:28] they just say that we can't they can't
[55:29] bank us but um you know we all of us are
[55:33] volunteers no one takes a salary we're
[55:36] funded solely by donations and by some
[55:38] corporate memberships
[55:40] we have very very low running costs and
[55:43] somehow we are too risky to to bank.
[55:47] Um, which which is pretty offensive.
[55:50] Uh, so it's it's hard not to like what
[55:51] we're reading in the in the reform
[55:53] document at the moment. Um, a sovereign
[55:56] Bitcoin reserve fund. Um, they
[55:59] interestingly they didn't the reform
[56:02] guys didn't mention the fact that the UK
[56:04] is already the third biggest nation
[56:05] state holder of Bitcoin which we have
[56:07] flagged to them directly. Um, and I'll
[56:10] come back to that actually in a second.
[56:12] Paying taxes in cryptocurrency in taxes
[56:14] in Bitcoin. So that would enable I
[56:16] suppose a feeder fund for the sovereign
[56:18] reserve to exist. You know if I were to
[56:20] pay taxes we've already given some
[56:22] feedback on this which is that um if
[56:25] they if this bill is ever passed they
[56:27] need to ensure that any taxes that are
[56:29] paid in Bitcoin are not subject to CGT.
[56:31] So I shouldn't I shouldn't have to pay
[56:32] CGT on top of my tax. And then rapid
[56:35] policym timelines who can who can be
[56:37] cross with that fantastic idea. So, you
[56:40] know, I think what they've what they've
[56:42] done here, they've really kicked the
[56:43] Everton window open and other parties
[56:46] now have to respond to what they've done
[56:49] here because I think I think the last
[56:51] point to note on this before I shut up
[56:53] is that there are actually, you know,
[56:55] 12% of the of the British adults public
[56:58] own cryptocurrency of one kind or
[57:00] another. Most of that's Bitcoin. That's
[57:02] about 7 million people. There's a big
[57:04] there's a big chunk of votes there.
[57:06] Most definitely. And how much uh how
[57:08] much Bitcoin does the UK have right now
[57:10] as a result of I'm assuming it's similar
[57:11] to the US where it's various law
[57:13] enforcement activities, things like
[57:15] that, confiscations. What what is the
[57:16] number that they're at? 61,000 plus.
[57:19] It's a huge amount. It's a lot of $6.5
[57:22] billion. Yeah. Yeah. Have have there
[57:26] been any proposals or plans uh that are
[57:29] like they going the way of Germany where
[57:31] it's like we should we should sell this
[57:32] off. we should get rid of this and you
[57:34] know use the the proceeds to fund XYZ.
[57:38] Well, I unfortunately I think that's
[57:39] probably what's going to happen. So, um
[57:43] it's it we have been lobbying the Labor
[57:47] government for some time to take this
[57:49] seriously to acknowledge that this asset
[57:52] is valuable. it's of strategic
[57:53] importance that even if they don't like
[57:55] Bitcoin, they owe it to the people that
[57:57] they represent to learn how to hold it,
[58:00] to use it, to safeguard it, to use it
[58:01] for the good of the nation. The response
[58:04] that we've got so far is that yeah,
[58:05] they're not really that interested and
[58:07] it's not really ours. It's under the
[58:09] Proceeds of Crime Act because this is a
[58:11] confiscation. There's a piece of
[58:13] legislation in the United Kingdom called
[58:14] poker, proceeds of crime act. Under that
[58:17] if assets are confiscated and there's a
[58:21] successful confiscation order put in by
[58:23] the government what happens at the end
[58:24] is the assets are sold half of it goes
[58:27] to the home office which is like our
[58:29] department of homeland affairs and then
[58:31] half of it goes to law enforcement.
[58:34] So, at the moment, the latest, it
[58:36] actually a funny coincidence. I was
[58:38] sitting three rows back in the front
[58:40] waiting to hear Vice President Vance
[58:42] speak at Bitcoin 2025.
[58:45] And then a reply drops into my inbox
[58:47] from Emma Reynolds, who is the city
[58:49] minister in the United Kingdom, who has
[58:52] responsibility for this area of of of
[58:54] policy, saying, "Yeah, we don't we don't
[58:57] think Bitcoin is a good asset for us to
[58:58] have, and yeah, we we know that um we
[59:01] know that we've got a lot of it, but
[59:03] we're not going to amend poker to allow
[59:05] us to keep it." So yeah, at the moment
[59:08] it's going to be sold. got I I saw was
[59:11] this the uh the letter that you had
[59:13] you'd posted on your uh X account that
[59:15] was basically like saying it doesn't
[59:16] align with our uh you know our our
[59:18] objectives for this fund which is you
[59:20] know to to basically they're essentially
[59:22] saying it was too risky uh for them you
[59:24] know in in so many words right
[59:27] which is just exactly right seems kind
[59:29] of absurd that if you look at like how
[59:32] long they've held it I don't know how
[59:33] long they have held it for but
[59:34] presumably it's appreciated massively in
[59:37] price in the amount of time that they've
[59:38] held it so you would think that that
[59:39] would the the risk would be to get rid
[59:41] of it, but I don't know. I'm not a I'm
[59:43] not a politician. So, it's funny you
[59:46] it's funny you say that. So, um Emma
[59:48] Reynolds spoke at a digital assets
[59:50] conference um in May and said, "We're
[59:54] not going to consider having a Bitcoin
[59:56] strategic reserve." Within a week, the
[59:59] amount of the Bitcoin that we'd h we we
[60:01] hold as a nation increased by $300
[60:03] million.
[60:05] So, I did flag that to her. It's like,
[60:07] dude, you you've made you made 300
[60:09] million in a week without doing
[60:11] anything.
[60:12] Just
[60:15] I mean, it's just it it's just kind of
[60:18] insane. And you know what what just
[60:21] continues to sort of boggle my mind is
[60:23] that again uh I get it. And as we
[60:26] discussed earlier, I have empathy for
[60:28] people that don't get Bitcoin right
[60:30] away. I didn't. So, it would be quite
[60:32] hypocritical of me to think that
[60:34] somebody else should. Yeah, exactly.
[60:35] Most of us didn't. That's okay. What
[60:38] what I do take issue with is when you
[60:40] have uh you know an organization, a
[60:42] policy institute like like you guys are
[60:44] running with uh the UK Bitcoin Policy
[60:46] Institute and you have people who are
[60:48] basically feeding you information like
[60:50] really good high signal information and
[60:52] you're getting fed all of this. You
[60:54] know, it's delivered to you on a silver
[60:56] platter and yet you still at that point
[60:58] it's it's a choice to remain willfully
[61:00] ignorant in my mind. And that's that's
[61:03] what I think is it's it's frustrating,
[61:05] you know, and we see this in the US too.
[61:07] We have a better situation obviously uh
[61:10] than the UK, but still you see it. I
[61:12] mean, you still have your uh you know,
[61:13] your your Elizabeth Warren, let's say.
[61:16] She's a she's a special breed. Yeah. I
[61:21] mean, even before I started um I started
[61:24] work on on actual policy, I I was
[61:27] already um being as irritating to
[61:29] Elizabeth Warren as I could. Actually,
[61:31] interesting. you something you mentioned
[61:32] earlier made me remember this the the
[61:33] the question of whether whether ideas
[61:36] exist in the ether and and you reach out
[61:38] and find them. Um so my my my kids and I
[61:42] in response to Elizabeth Warren's uh
[61:45] original piece of drafting I think which
[61:46] would have which would have designated
[61:48] every node runner as a money service
[61:49] business. So my my kids and I we we
[61:52] played a little game one Christmas to to
[61:54] um to illustrate how stupid that idea
[61:55] was cuz uh my kids and I we we built a
[61:58] small Raspberry Pi together uh long time
[62:01] ago now 3 4 years and uh and then we we
[62:04] run a node on it and it was a computer
[62:06] science project um particularly my
[62:08] younger daughter she likes building
[62:10] stuff we build uh we build computers
[62:12] together and that I thought that was a
[62:13] fun project for us to do together. Uh
[62:15] that's awesome. It was it was awesome.
[62:18] Um, and then this Christmas we we I put
[62:20] a zero and a one on either side of a
[62:22] coin, and we flipped it 256 times,
[62:24] generated this huge binary number,
[62:27] converted to hexadimals, generated a
[62:29] private key, and then set up a wallet. I
[62:34] then put $10 of Bitcoin in it, and
[62:36] deleted the wallet. And I said to the
[62:38] kids, "Right, you have to recreate. This
[62:40] is your this is your Christmas treasure
[62:43] hunt. You've got to recreate the steps
[62:44] that we just did." And then then you get
[62:45] the Bitcoin at the end. Uh and they did
[62:48] it. It took them like 3 weeks to like
[62:50] work through everything we' done. Uh and
[62:52] then I put a little video of it up on on
[62:54] Twitter saying, you know, Elizabeth
[62:56] Warren, this is completely stupid. Are
[62:58] you going to say that my children
[63:00] flipping a coin in my living room are a
[63:03] money service business? Your legislation
[63:06] is absolutely absurd. It just makes I
[63:10] mean it I think to your point, that's
[63:12] one of the things that frustrates me so
[63:13] much. If you you you may have original
[63:17] opinions, but unless you test those,
[63:19] unless you test your priors against
[63:21] objective reality, how can you ever move
[63:24] on or or or achieve a greater level of
[63:27] understanding?
[63:30] Amen. And I mean then there's the flip
[63:31] side of this which is and we've
[63:33] forstalled this a bit on the US side,
[63:35] but I know there's uh uh just speaking
[63:37] of CBDC's,
[63:39] you know, which is I view as kind of the
[63:40] the antithesis of Bitcoin. the CBDC's
[63:43] are are peak fiat. They're they're all
[63:46] the worst parts of fiat made even worse
[63:48] without the only decent part of fiat,
[63:50] which is the ability to anonymous
[63:51] anonymously exchange cash. Like that
[63:54] that's that's the one good thing that
[63:55] fiat still has going for it. It's like
[63:57] that's that's great. Um but let's let's
[63:59] take that away. Let's give money an
[64:01] expiration date. Let's just make it a
[64:02] you know a government coupon essentially
[64:04] that we can track and surveil and uh you
[64:06] know keep a keep an eye on you to make
[64:08] sure you're not stepping out of line and
[64:09] shut you off from the system at any
[64:10] time. But I saw the uh the big brother
[64:13] watch uh report uh that just come out.
[64:15] Can you can you talk about that a little
[64:16] bit? Is the UK government so they're
[64:18] they're planning to pilot a digital
[64:19] pound. What's the situation there? Is
[64:22] there good push back against that as
[64:23] well? There is. So the situation is not
[64:27] as dire as it may appear in the United
[64:28] Kingdom. So again delving a little bit
[64:30] into into UK politics. So the like most
[64:35] countries the United Kingdom is
[64:37] considering a a digital power the CBDC.
[64:40] Ultimately, I think a lot of these ideas
[64:42] stem from Facebook's creation of the DM
[64:45] or Libra coin, which made a lot of
[64:47] central banks [ __ ] the bed a few years
[64:49] ago, you know, including the Fed before
[64:51] the Trump administration,
[64:54] and that really led to a lot of the
[64:56] efforts that we see today to create
[64:58] central bank digital currencies. Now,
[65:00] there's a bit of crossover between the
[65:02] BPUK work and Big Brother watch. We've
[65:05] collaborated loosely in the past to
[65:07] feedback to the Bank of England. Uh we
[65:10] actually got uh together we got more
[65:12] than 50,000 responses from the public
[65:15] and other organizations sent into the
[65:17] Bank of England, the majority of them
[65:18] negative. Um effectively saying people
[65:21] do not want this stuff and this is the
[65:23] these are the reasons why. Um I wrote a
[65:26] very long piece on it which is still on
[65:27] our website. Big Brother Watch sent in a
[65:30] piece as well. So Big Brother Watch are
[65:31] an institution that uh pushes um for you
[65:35] know individual liberty, privacy rights,
[65:38] freedom to transact and so on. So
[65:39] there's a good deal of crossover between
[65:41] our work and their work. We know the
[65:43] team there. We collaborate with them and
[65:45] also actually collaborate with Alex
[65:47] Gladstein's team at the human rights
[65:49] foundation on the same ideas.
[65:51] So that the fundamental principle here
[65:53] is the freedom to transact. you and I
[65:55] should have the unfettered ability to
[65:58] transact freely for any for any lawful
[66:01] purpose and no one should be able to
[66:02] stop that.
[66:04] Um, so the I was at I was in parliament
[66:07] like a year and a half ago on this and
[66:08] then again this week and there's
[66:11] actually a lot of a lot of push back in
[66:12] parliament against this. Not all not all
[66:15] parliamentarians are completely on board
[66:16] with this and the again being slightly
[66:20] geeky for a second. So if a political
[66:23] Sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm I'm a geek at
[66:25] heart, so I have to like go down these
[66:27] rabbit holes. Put your sarries in a sack
[66:29] and and and throw them into throw them
[66:31] into the river. Oh, awesome. So, when a
[66:34] when a political party is elected to the
[66:36] United Kingdom, they have a manifesto
[66:38] when they're when they're competing for
[66:40] so when they're doing going through
[66:41] their hustings and so on during the
[66:43] election, they they have a series of of
[66:45] things of of items that are in their
[66:47] manifesto which they are campaigning on.
[66:49] And there's a convention in the United
[66:51] Kingdom which states that if something
[66:54] is in the manifesto then the House of
[66:56] Lords won't block it. Now the the way
[67:00] that the way that laws are made in the
[67:02] United Kingdom, the laws need to pass
[67:03] first the House of Commons and then the
[67:05] House of Lords and then they receive
[67:08] royal ascent from the king. Brilliant.
[67:11] Um and ridiculous at the same time.
[67:13] Royal ascent. Wow. No, no kings. Um so
[67:19] the interestingly for this parliament a
[67:21] CBDC wasn't in the manifesto. So that
[67:24] the first useful thing to note is that
[67:26] at least until 2029 this is creating a
[67:29] CBDC was not a commitment of the current
[67:32] government which is a good thing.
[67:34] There's a lot of opposition particularly
[67:36] in the House of Lords towards creating a
[67:38] CBDC not least from the former governor
[67:40] of the Bank of England who is now a lord
[67:42] Mvin King. uh the Lords released a
[67:45] brilliant report a couple of years ago
[67:47] which called CBDC's a solution in search
[67:49] of a problem and there's a lot of debate
[67:53] it's actually if anyone's interested
[67:54] it's it's worth reading the the
[67:56] transcript of that whole debate if
[67:57] anyone has any time to do so uh there's
[68:00] push back from Mvin King there's push
[68:02] back from another lord Lord Desai
[68:04] uh Lord Desai is very worried about
[68:06] access to cash for the unbanked for
[68:08] those who can't pass KYC and so on you
[68:10] know an is an important problem the
[68:12] latest data And our financial regulator
[68:15] in the UK shows that we have at least a
[68:17] million people in the UK who still don't
[68:19] have a bank account. Million adults. So
[68:22] those people wouldn't be able to pass
[68:23] KYC to get a bank account. Can't pass
[68:26] KYC to use the CBDC.
[68:29] So there's a lot first thing to note I
[68:30] think is there's a lot of push back
[68:31] definitely in the lords also in the
[68:33] commons as well.
[68:35] And the second key thing to note is that
[68:38] because of that push back that that
[68:40] creates a reasonable firereak between
[68:43] where we are now and between the
[68:45] creation of a CBDC because the Bank of
[68:47] England act the piece of legislation
[68:49] that gives the Bank of England its
[68:50] powers doesn't allow the Bank of England
[68:53] actually to issue money to the public in
[68:56] the form that a CBDC would require. And
[69:00] the previous government acknowledged
[69:01] this. In fact, I've got documentation
[69:03] from them that says we wouldn't
[69:05] effectively be able to create a CBDC
[69:08] without passing a new leg a new new
[69:10] piece of legislation.
[69:12] And my personal opinion, I think the the
[69:15] law would back this up, is that it would
[69:17] be very difficult to get that piece of
[69:18] legislation passed in the first place.
[69:21] And secondly, you have to wonder, you
[69:23] know, what on earth is going to be the
[69:25] purpose of a CBDC other than financial
[69:27] repression. And you know, people don't
[69:30] like that.
[69:32] And the more the more that people learn
[69:34] about the CBDC, the less they like it.
[69:37] So there's a real need in the UK at the
[69:40] moment and probably in the US as well to
[69:42] let your representatives know that you
[69:44] don't want this and you don't like it.
[69:46] And if people vote for it, you're going
[69:47] to vote them out.
[69:49] Politicians need to remember that they
[69:51] work for us. They don't. We, as we said
[69:53] earlier, there is we're a representative
[69:55] democracy.
[69:56] They need to represent our views and our
[70:00] desires in parliament, not the other way
[70:02] round.
[70:04] Do you I mean I agree. The sad thing is
[70:09] it feels like without radical change,
[70:12] whether that be in the US or in the UK
[70:14] or anywhere, that is just something that
[70:17] we continue to say and to shout from the
[70:20] rooftops, but that never actually really
[70:22] happens because the incentive structure
[70:24] is so broken. I mean, you know, you know
[70:26] what I mean? And I don't mean to sound
[70:28] doomery, but you get to a point where
[70:30] you just realize how entrenched these
[70:31] systems are. Uh, you know, if you're
[70:34] like you and I, you'd probably say,
[70:35] well, this ultimately comes back to a,
[70:37] you know, a broken incentive system
[70:39] driven by, uh, a broken monetary system.
[70:42] And is there anything that's ever, you
[70:44] know, like what really breaks this? What
[70:46] what, you know, what what stops this
[70:48] train, if anything, you know, and and,
[70:51] you know, is is that something you're
[70:52] you're hopeful for? or you mentioned
[70:53] that the UK is at this inflection point.
[70:56] Is that an inflection point where there
[70:57] starts to be uh enough unrest, enough
[71:00] dissatisfaction on behalf of the
[71:02] populace that you actually see them, you
[71:05] know, start to demand change or is this
[71:08] one of those things where, you know,
[71:09] sometimes I think change is really uh
[71:12] real change is forced from without. It's
[71:14] forced from a parallel system versus
[71:16] happening from within because the
[71:18] existing system doesn't have an
[71:19] incentive to change itself, you know.
[71:23] I think that's very profound and
[71:25] actually fundamentally true. No one who
[71:28] benefits from the existing system will
[71:31] ever try to change it. And again drawing
[71:35] from my own personal experience of
[71:36] living in two essentially failed and
[71:39] failing societies,
[71:41] what you tend to see,
[71:45] and again looking at previous example,
[71:46] what you tend to see is is a regime that
[71:49] hangs on to the advantages of the
[71:51] collapsing system. So in in Syria, I
[71:54] lived under the I lived under the rule
[71:56] of of President Assad's father and that
[71:59] was already a failing society and then
[72:01] it became even even more so after um
[72:06] after Assad's senior died. But you still
[72:09] have a situation where the regime has
[72:10] enormous power but you know basic
[72:13] services are no longer functioning and
[72:16] people are beginning to have to take
[72:18] things into their own hands again. And
[72:20] it's interesting to be we're beginning
[72:22] to see that in the United Kingdom now. I
[72:24] mentioned earlier our roads not
[72:26] functioning. There's a huge amount of
[72:28] shoplifting in in stores. Uh you know
[72:32] it's very very difficult to see a
[72:34] doctor. It's not many people are
[72:36] noticing this at the moment but
[72:37] fundamentally this is this is how
[72:39] complex societies collapse. I I know a
[72:41] lot of a lot of people may have a
[72:43] fantasy about some kind of, you know, I
[72:46] don't know, 12 monkey style collapse
[72:48] where you end up, you know, wearing
[72:49] leather clothes and wandering around on
[72:51] the rooftops and just shooting lions and
[72:53] stuff and that that
[72:56] tends not to happen. What what you see
[72:58] is a is a gradual in shittening of
[73:00] everything. You know, your roads stop
[73:01] functioning. There stops being gas or or
[73:05] petrol in in your in your fuel stations.
[73:08] things get harder to buy in the stores.
[73:11] You know, maybe your school stops
[73:13] functioning, so the parents have to pay
[73:15] more to, you know, to keep the roof
[73:17] fixed or to pay the teacher salaries.
[73:20] And these things happen at a slow pace,
[73:23] but over time, then you look you look
[73:25] back 20 years and think, "Oh [ __ ] you
[73:26] know, 20 years ago, I used to be able to
[73:27] see a doctor and my roads weren't full
[73:29] of potholes, but now I'm going out and
[73:31] I'm filling in potholes myself on my
[73:33] road. Uh, and I'm repairing my own car
[73:37] and I'm brewing biodiesel in my backyard
[73:40] because I've got a, you know, this is
[73:44] how fundamentally how complex societies
[73:46] collapse. And, you know, I I don't want
[73:47] to crow here, but I I have seen it
[73:49] happen twice before and more so in
[73:52] Zimbab, you know, in Zimbabwe, there was
[73:54] a great meme actually before memes
[73:56] really existed, which was, you know, we
[73:59] don't worry, we'll make we'll make a
[74:00] plan.
[74:02] You'll you'll always make a plan.
[74:04] you know, everything may go to [ __ ] but
[74:06] you're still going to make a plan and
[74:07] you're going to be okay because you you
[74:09] know, because you're a bore and it's
[74:10] going to be fine.
[74:12] And this, I think, although a lot of
[74:15] people haven't realized it yet, is kind
[74:17] of where the UK is heading at the
[74:18] moment. And a significant reason for
[74:21] this is the gigantic I mean the dragging
[74:24] it slightly back to Bitcoin. The
[74:25] gigantic issue that I see personally is
[74:28] that the the liabilities of the state
[74:30] are so great now that it is impossible
[74:32] for the state to fund them.
[74:34] And I I know in the United States the D
[74:37] the debt is about 37 trillion. In the UK
[74:40] it's about 3 trillion. Already our
[74:43] annual payments not to pay down the debt
[74:46] but just on interest payments are bigger
[74:49] than defense and bigger than education
[74:51] for us. They sit only behind welfare and
[74:54] and pensions. And at the current rate of
[74:57] acceleration, God knows I mean it's not
[75:00] going to be too long before they're the
[75:01] biggest expense in the country. And that
[75:03] that's just unsustainable.
[75:07] Well, goes back to, you know, Lyn
[75:09] Alden's nothing stops this train meme
[75:11] because it's, you know, it's which is I
[75:13] think will go down as one of the top uh
[75:16] economic memes, not the top economic
[75:18] meme of of this century. Uh it continues
[75:21] to be proven true. But that's the thing.
[75:25] It seems like uh people who are in
[75:28] government, well, I would think that
[75:30] they know this. should know this at
[75:31] least like they should see the uh the
[75:34] basically unsustainable path that
[75:37] everyone is on. But I feel like there's
[75:38] just kind of this tacid acknowledgement
[75:41] that like well you know what else are we
[75:43] supposed to do? Like nothing stops this
[75:44] train. We literally uh the only thing we
[75:47] can do is continue to debase the
[75:48] currency because anything else is going
[75:50] to cause total system collapse and we
[75:52] don't want that on our watch. like at
[75:53] least wait until you know we're out and
[75:55] and you know we've we've gotten ours
[75:57] from the system and that then we can
[75:58] maybe have some total system collapse.
[76:00] But it it seems to me that more and more
[76:05] governments will be forced to come to
[76:08] the realization that holding Bitcoin as
[76:12] a nation state is probably the only way
[76:16] they're going to be able to actually
[76:18] have a functioning society in the
[76:20] decades to come. Now, you can think what
[76:23] you will about, you know, well, I don't
[76:25] think that governments should be holding
[76:27] Bitcoin. Bitcoin is for the individuals.
[76:28] And it's like, yeah, actually, Bitcoin
[76:30] is for anyone. It doesn't matter.
[76:32] Bitcoin doesn't care. That's the whole
[76:33] point. If Bitcoin could care, it
[76:35] wouldn't be Bitcoin. And then we
[76:36] wouldn't be having this conversation.
[76:38] Bitcoin is winning. This is what it
[76:40] looks like when something becomes starts
[76:41] becoming a dominant monetary asset and
[76:43] store of value and eventually medium
[76:44] exchange, a unit of account. Of course,
[76:46] everyone's going to want to use it
[76:48] because it's the best. if it wasn't the
[76:50] best, they wouldn't want to use it. And
[76:51] again, we're back full circle. So,
[76:54] putting that aside, and I always like to
[76:56] kind of add that disclaimer because some
[76:58] people think, you know, again, I don't
[76:59] want the US government. It doesn't
[77:00] matter what you want. Doesn't matter. I
[77:02] agree with you. I I'm I mean, my our
[77:04] message into the UK is
[77:07] effectively if you weren't holding the
[77:08] 61,000 Bitcoin, we would we would be
[77:10] indifferent. I don't I but I completely
[77:13] agree with it. I don't want governments
[77:14] to hold it, but I think it's inevitable
[77:15] if Bitcoin is successful money. Yeah.
[77:19] Exactly. And so, you know, but the the
[77:22] thing is it seems like again uh most
[77:26] governments that we already know what
[77:27] Germany did with it. Perhaps UK is in
[77:29] the same path. What as a as a policy
[77:32] institute, what are you guys like is
[77:34] this what you're most focused on right
[77:36] right now? Is it some of these other
[77:38] things, some of these other uh you know
[77:40] uh uh let's let's say guidances that
[77:42] you've given to the reform party? Where
[77:45] where is your key focus right now? What
[77:46] do you all view as the the most
[77:48] important thing for let's say Bitcoin,
[77:51] Bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin holders, uh
[77:54] whatever it may be in in the UK.
[77:57] Good question. So we we probably have a
[78:00] couple of key limbs. So I think first
[78:02] firstly we want to make it as easy as
[78:05] possible for everyone in the UK to hold,
[78:07] use and transact in Bitcoin as possible.
[78:09] And so within that I wrapped up ideas
[78:12] around it being CGT exempt if being used
[78:14] for payments a holding period after
[78:17] which it is it becomes CGT exempt and so
[78:19] on. And the general point there is that
[78:22] most economists will agree that a
[78:23] greater velocity of money in the economy
[78:25] is good and that increases growth that
[78:28] increases enterprise it increases the
[78:30] ability for people to use their money as
[78:32] they see fit in a productive economy. So
[78:35] there there are really no downsides in
[78:37] in increasing the velocity of money in
[78:39] the in the economy. And as a sidebar to
[78:43] that is the point that the although the
[78:45] government has the CGT rules in place,
[78:47] they don't seem to get a huge amount of
[78:48] money out of that mainly because either
[78:50] people hodddle or they don't declare.
[78:53] So you know they they may have a CGT
[78:55] rule in place but they're not getting
[78:56] any tax out of it.
[78:58] Second is is around the freedom to
[79:00] transact. And that that ties in with the
[79:03] the fact that no one should be denied
[79:05] access to banking services and uh access
[79:08] to exchanges if they want to move money
[79:11] from fiat to Bitcoin or Bitcoin to fiat
[79:14] or have their account closed because
[79:17] they happen to have transferred money to
[79:18] Coinbase or to Coin Corner for example.
[79:20] Um actually shout out to Coin Corner.
[79:22] They did ask a question underneath your
[79:24] tweet. Uh, CoinCon are obviously my
[79:26] favorite Bitcoin exchange in the UK. So,
[79:28] you know, shout out to Molly and her and
[79:30] her questionnaire.
[79:32] Um, and then thirdly is is really the
[79:35] fact that um, Bitcoin uh is obviously
[79:39] currently held by the government. They
[79:40] need to learn how to use it and to to do
[79:42] so on behalf of the nation. An
[79:45] additional point is and you mentioned
[79:47] cailment earlier which is an interesting
[79:49] point for the UK. Uh, maybe worth
[79:51] spending a second on that. Yeah, we have
[79:54] a large number of renewable energy
[79:56] generation plants in the UK and I'm sure
[79:58] you know and your listeners will know
[80:00] that an interesting thing about
[80:02] renewable generation is that it's
[80:04] obviously an intermittent supply and
[80:07] sometimes it produces more electricity
[80:09] than the grid needs and sometimes in
[80:12] more electricity than the grid can take.
[80:14] You can either divert that to battery
[80:16] storage or cail it which is effectively
[80:20] when the plants get paid to spin idly or
[80:22] to turn off. At the moment that uh
[80:25] cailment cost in the UK is paid by by me
[80:29] basically by all of the users of
[80:30] electricity. It's added to our bills.
[80:33] It's one of the reasons we have the
[80:34] highest industrial electricity costs in
[80:36] the world and one of the highest
[80:38] domestic costs in the world. And as you
[80:40] know, if you have really high power
[80:42] costs, that has an impact on literally
[80:44] everything else in your country. You're
[80:45] not going to develop new steel plants.
[80:47] You're not going to build new weapons.
[80:48] You're not going to develop AI. You're
[80:50] not going to build new steel new
[80:52] factories, new nuclear. You're not
[80:55] effectively high energy costs throttle
[80:57] everything else. There are no countries
[80:59] in the world which have a low amount of
[81:02] energy usage and a high amount of and a
[81:05] high standard of living basically. So
[81:07] it's a real problem and the Labor
[81:10] government seemed completely resistant
[81:13] to engaging with us on this particular
[81:15] point. One of our contacts uh
[81:18] exjournalist from from Coindesk
[81:21] um he spoke directly to Ed Milliband on
[81:23] this particular issue around the
[81:25] integration of Bitcoin miners with
[81:27] renewable energy generation plants and
[81:29] how they could provide a commercial
[81:31] solution for that wasted power. Meliban
[81:33] shut him down and and said, "But Bitcoin
[81:36] is useless." So that's the kind of
[81:38] attitude we have from the government at
[81:39] the moment.
[81:41] That that's just so frustrating because
[81:43] here you've got this problem which
[81:45] everyone would acknowledge is a problem.
[81:47] It's costing however like the recent
[81:49] figures I saw was like over a billion
[81:51] over a billion a year. It's a lot of
[81:53] money and that's being borne by the
[81:56] taxpayers and consumers of energy as you
[81:59] said throttle like throttling the
[82:01] economy. You have this solution sitting
[82:04] right there. You you have the these this
[82:07] incredible technology that can literally
[82:10] take all of that energy that you're
[82:11] otherwise just wasting and turn it into
[82:14] the hardest money that has ever existed.
[82:17] It's like magic.
[82:19] And instead you say, "Well, but it's not
[82:21] good for anything." What? It's good for
[82:22] the literal problem that you have right
[82:24] here. This thing we're discussing, it's
[82:26] good. I mean, it's good for many other
[82:27] things, but it literally solves your
[82:29] problem. And then to say, "No, uh,
[82:31] sorry. It's it's just not good for
[82:32] anything." Like, that is is truly like
[82:36] it's sad. That's sad to see that you
[82:38] have a solution sitting staring you in
[82:40] the face and you say, "No, I'm sorry. I
[82:42] just can't see what it'd be good for."
[82:45] No, this is this is I mean, to your
[82:47] point earlier, you you have some empathy
[82:48] with people who may not understand it.
[82:51] you know, you and I I didn't understand
[82:52] it when we first encountered it. I had
[82:55] many touch points before I finally took
[82:57] another look at it. And you know, my my
[82:59] eventual touch point was, why hasn't
[83:02] this thing died yet? I thought it was
[83:03] going to die like 5 years ago. Why Why
[83:05] is it still around?
[83:07] And that was purely in the spirit of
[83:10] mild curiosity.
[83:13] It's the lack of
[83:15] and and actually, you know what, I don't
[83:16] have a good answer to this. It's a it's
[83:18] a complete lack of curiosity that I
[83:20] completely fail to understand. And
[83:22] perhaps it's just because you and I are
[83:24] very very different people from the kind
[83:26] of people who go into government. And m
[83:28] maybe they genuinely are so different
[83:30] that we we couldn't get on with them at
[83:32] a party.
[83:33] Do you think we'll start to see uh in
[83:37] you know around the world let's say but
[83:39] maybe specifically in the in the UK here
[83:42] do you think we'll start to see a lot
[83:43] more uh you know there's there's a new
[83:46] generation coming up right the old guard
[83:48] what is it progress advances one funeral
[83:51] at a time and I'm uh just to clarify for
[83:54] the UA or UK sensors out there you know
[83:56] I'm not uh suggesting violence I'm
[83:57] suggesting peaceful and natural
[83:59] causebased uh passing on just one blank
[84:03] quote originally. Yeah. Yeah. No, don't
[84:06] worry. Don't worry don't worry about the
[84:07] sensors. That's that's a legitimate
[84:09] astrophysicist talking there. Okay. So,
[84:12] they'll let that one slide. Just wanted
[84:13] to make sure. Just just fall back on
[84:15] plank. Yeah, that's that's perfect. But,
[84:18] you know, do we start to see does the is
[84:21] that really what happens? like this
[84:23] change that we're talking about, this
[84:25] acceptance of of of Bitcoin as the only
[84:27] thing that's going to save your nation,
[84:29] whatever nation that may be, the only
[84:30] thing that's going to save you as an
[84:31] individual, the only thing that's going
[84:32] to save your household. Is that
[84:34] something that hap uh has to just happen
[84:37] naturally through the passing of time as
[84:39] these folks who learned about Bitcoin
[84:41] too late in life and to your point
[84:43] earlier said, uh, you know, I hate that
[84:45] whatever that is. It's new and it's
[84:47] scary and I don't like it. Is that the
[84:49] only way that we get forward? Do do we
[84:51] start to see a new political class come
[84:52] up and a new economic class come up that
[84:56] are, you know, Bitcoin uh Bitcoin native
[84:59] uh you know, close to it like this
[85:00] youngest generation is now, but we've
[85:03] got a lot of hardcore Bitcoiners out
[85:04] there who dislike the state and want
[85:06] nothing to do with politics. Uh but
[85:09] there's got to be a lot of them who say,
[85:11] you know what, somebody has to step up.
[85:13] I just need to like I need to go and do
[85:15] this. Like that's the only way that
[85:16] things are going to change. Or is that
[85:18] just a futile endeavor? And again, we
[85:20] just need to let Bitcoin do its thing
[85:22] from the side. Let the existing system
[85:23] implode, come down in ashes, and a new
[85:25] phoenix rises from those ashes down the
[85:26] line. It's such a complex question.
[85:30] Again, I made a big No, no, it's a it's
[85:34] a really good question. I And again, I'm
[85:35] not sure I'm going to have a clear
[85:36] answer to that because there there are
[85:38] so many different pieces to unpack
[85:40] there. I mean, one is addressing your
[85:43] last point. Are we going to see more
[85:45] people rising up who want to do
[85:47] something about it? I hope so. One
[85:49] problem we've had in the UK is, as I
[85:51] mentioned, there are 7 million of us in
[85:53] the UK, but not many of us are are out
[85:56] there in public. And I have to say, I
[85:59] was a non for a really long time. And
[86:01] I'm still uncomfortable about being out
[86:04] in public. And my aim over the longer
[86:07] term is to make myself irrelevant and to
[86:09] disappear once again into anonymity.
[86:13] I don't particularly enjoy being public.
[86:17] Uh, I'm naturally quite an introvert and
[86:21] I'm not necessarily doing this because I
[86:23] enjoy it. I'm doing it because I think
[86:24] it's important and also no one else was
[86:27] doing it.
[86:29] Uh, you know, we had a lot of shitcoiner
[86:32] advocacy in the UK. We didn't have any
[86:34] Bitcoin advocacy until we started this
[86:35] group. So, for whatever reason, I feel
[86:39] it needed to be done. And I hope at some
[86:41] point I'm going to be able to pass it on
[86:42] to someone else. hopefully some of the 7
[86:45] million that we know that we have in the
[86:47] UK are we willing to to step up and and
[86:49] to do this to to your point around
[86:53] realizing that you need to do something.
[86:55] I really hope that is going to happen.
[86:58] Uh obviously every podcast needs to have
[87:01] some kind of reference to the to the
[87:02] Roman Empire. Um naturally although
[87:06] although actually being completely
[87:07] technical this is this is pre-mpire this
[87:09] is to the Roman Republic. Um, full
[87:11] disclosure, I I studied classics at
[87:13] university. So, I have a certain certain
[87:15] affinity for for this. So, um, you think
[87:17] about the Roman Empire or the Roman
[87:19] Republic like many times a day then, not
[87:21] just once. Many many times a day. Okay.
[87:23] Not not just one. So, uh, have you heard
[87:24] of uh, Cenatus or King Canatus depending
[87:27] on your pronunciation? Yes. Yeah. So, he
[87:30] was he's held up as one of the prime
[87:33] examples of of Roman honor. So, the the
[87:36] Romans had an interesting system. They p
[87:39] pre-mpire they had a consular system
[87:41] where they would have two effectively
[87:42] two heads of state who are elected for
[87:44] one year at a time and they would serve
[87:46] as dual consoles one domestic and one
[87:48] foreign. So one would be responsible for
[87:50] the you know for the outer reaches of
[87:52] the empire and the other would govern at
[87:53] home in Rome but in times of crisis they
[87:56] could set aside the consular system and
[87:59] appoint a dictator a dictator for a
[88:01] short period of time who would then step
[88:04] down after the period of crisis was
[88:06] over. So the interesting thing about
[88:07] Julius Caesar was he was appointed
[88:09] dictator for life which eventually
[88:11] became empirator general or emperor
[88:14] under Augustus primis interpatre first
[88:16] among equals. So kingus is held up as
[88:20] this incredible example of Roman virtue.
[88:22] He was he had retired from public life
[88:25] and he was running his farm and the con
[88:29] the the the uh the republic had hit a
[88:32] period of crisis and they came to him
[88:33] and they said we we want to appoint you
[88:34] dictator and he agreed to come and and
[88:37] serve as dictator for a short period of
[88:38] time and then when the crisis was over
[88:40] he set aside his office he resigned his
[88:43] roles and he went back to his farm so he
[88:45] he's held up as this incredible and you
[88:48] know he he he's an aspirational figure
[88:49] for me that that's the that's the kind
[88:51] of person I think we we should aspire to
[88:53] be. You know, there's there there's a
[88:55] job that needs to be done and some of us
[88:57] need need to step up and do it and then
[88:59] when it's done, you you step back and
[89:02] you vanish. That that that that's kind
[89:05] of where where I would like us all to
[89:08] be. But, you know, there there are a lot
[89:09] more there are a lot more kinkati out
[89:11] there and I' I'd like to exhort them to
[89:13] to come forward and be be part of this
[89:15] because I think it's it's incredibly
[89:17] important
[89:18] and I'm fundamentally an optimist. I
[89:21] don't I don't I don't think that
[89:23] collapse is inevitable. I I don't
[89:25] believe that you you need to, you know,
[89:28] do not go gentle into that good night.
[89:30] You know, rage rage against the dying of
[89:32] the light. Don't just sit back and act
[89:35] and and say that, you know, decline is
[89:37] inevitable.
[89:39] We have agency. We can go out the I
[89:41] mean, your your entire nation is an
[89:43] example of this to the rest of us. You
[89:45] know, you don't need to sit back and let
[89:47] the king tell you what to do. Although
[89:49] technically in the UK, we do. Um, but
[89:52] no, you you you I I was talking about
[89:55] this with Peter the last time I spoke
[89:56] with him. You know, you you can start
[89:58] small and for me, Bitcoin is both a top-
[90:01] down movement and a bottom-up movement.
[90:04] So, individual people realizing the
[90:07] government isn't going to come and save
[90:08] them and preserving their wealth in
[90:10] Bitcoin is a valid and valuable thing
[90:13] that you can do. But at the same time,
[90:16] we should also engage with our elected
[90:17] representatives and try and educate them
[90:20] to understand the same thing. I jotted
[90:22] down something while you were speaking
[90:23] earlier. You know, why why don't why
[90:26] don't our elected officials see this?
[90:29] And I think for some of us in the UK,
[90:31] the the problem is solely talking about
[90:32] Bitcoin. If you ask them, would you like
[90:35] we have this sovereign debt problem?
[90:37] Nothing stops this train. We should
[90:39] hedge ourselves with this with a
[90:42] pristine form of collateral that no
[90:44] other country can debase or or dilute
[90:48] without mentioning Bitcoin. They say,
[90:50] "Well, that sounds brilliant. Well, let
[90:51] let's get some of that pristine
[90:52] collateral."
[90:55] And then once once the idea is planted,
[90:58] then the specifics kind of sold
[90:59] themselves.
[91:02] I like that approach. It's like just get
[91:04] them get them to agree and then
[91:06] mentioned you know it's the it's the
[91:07] foot in the door versus the the door in
[91:09] the face of Bitcoin because there is a
[91:11] lot of baggage for better or worse that
[91:12] comes along that's associated with
[91:14] Bitcoin. There's been a lot of uh you
[91:17] know there's been a lot of terrible
[91:18] reporting on it for many years. Some of
[91:20] that's improving. It's been a lot of uh
[91:23] you know just let's say bad information
[91:25] out there and yes there's uh you know do
[91:29] your own research like sure but a lot of
[91:32] the folks that are actually in charge of
[91:34] making the laws don't do their own
[91:35] research. They rely on other people to
[91:36] do it for them and so they need to be
[91:39] presented with it and maybe you need to
[91:40] you know foot in the door of them and
[91:42] you know just a sly roundabout way let's
[91:44] say you know get that get that Trojan
[91:47] horse through the door. Yeah. Yeah, if
[91:48] it if it worked for Hayek, then it could
[91:51] work for us as well.
[91:54] Exactly. Well, Freddy, I want to be
[91:56] conscious of your uh your time here cuz
[91:57] I know you have a uh a stop. Is there
[92:00] anything we didn't get a chance to
[92:02] cover? We we've we've gone uh down
[92:04] several different rabbit holes. Anything
[92:06] else either with your work at the uh the
[92:08] uh policy institute or just generally
[92:11] that you wanted to make sure we covered
[92:12] or did we do an okay job? I think I'm
[92:15] pretty happy actually. We we we covered
[92:16] a lot of stuff that I wasn't expecting
[92:18] to cover. I I didn't expect to talk
[92:20] about um the the later Roman Republic,
[92:22] but you know, I'm glad that we got a
[92:24] chance to do that. And uh you know,
[92:27] maybe some people will dig up to dig up
[92:29] the history of Kingartus and uh
[92:33] as a result, I I hope so. Uh where where
[92:36] do you want to send people? Uh I I'll
[92:39] link everything in the show notes as
[92:40] well so people can go check out the work
[92:42] you're doing. And is there anything that
[92:43] they can do to uh to you know if you are
[92:45] a UK citizen or just a citizen of
[92:47] somewhere else in the world, what can
[92:49] people do to support the work that you
[92:50] guys continue to do? Oh, you're very
[92:53] kind. So um you'll have a link to our
[92:56] website. Uh that's bitcoin policy.uk. Um
[92:59] I'm most active on Twitter or X. I'm
[93:01] just ready. Uh so most of the work we
[93:04] publish I will also publish on my my own
[93:06] personal Twitter as well. Uh if you are
[93:08] in the UK, keep an eye on our website,
[93:10] particularly the work portfolio. So we
[93:12] are, as I mentioned earlier, we are
[93:13] shortly going to be having some template
[93:15] letters for you to reach out to your
[93:17] MPs, whether it be in terms of
[93:20] understanding Bitcoin or financial
[93:22] freedom or pushing back against CBDC's.
[93:24] We built an API that will enable you to
[93:26] pull up your representative's email very
[93:29] easily and very quickly and easily copy
[93:31] that template and send it into your MP.
[93:33] And like I said earlier, top down and
[93:35] bottom up. So the the top down movements
[93:38] MPs need to understand there's a big
[93:39] voter block here and there's a lot of us
[93:42] and we're motivated and we care a lot uh
[93:44] and eventually this will become an
[93:45] election issue for them. Um that that's
[93:48] probably my main ask but so thank you
[93:50] thank you for the opportunity.
[93:52] Absolutely. I I uh hope that we can do
[93:54] this in in person sometime. It was a
[93:56] good uh good opportunity to meet you in
[93:57] the flesh in Vegas and uh and yeah I'm
[94:01] uh I'm going to be in uh in our own
[94:02] nation's uh capital here. Not that Vegas
[94:05] is the capital of any uh you know but uh
[94:08] just speaking of policy stuff because
[94:10] our US BDC policy institute is doing a
[94:12] summit here uh I think it gosh it's next
[94:14] week 25th 26th we're supposed to be
[94:16] coming to that um very sadly I can't
[94:19] make it. It's my last week in my fiat
[94:21] job. Ah okay. Very sadly. Does that mean
[94:25] you're moving to Bitcoin focus full-time
[94:28] or another fiat job as well? This is a
[94:30] bit of a spoiler actually. Yeah I am
[94:31] moving moving fulltime into Bitcoin. So,
[94:34] all right. From from August. Wow. Well,
[94:37] congratulations then. That's fantastic.
[94:39] Thank you. I'll be be That's Wow. Wow.
[94:42] Wow. Big big moment. Now, so there, you
[94:45] know, but now I I'm so much more bullish
[94:47] on uh Bitcoin policy in the UK
[94:49] succeeding,
[94:50] mate. Thank you. Well, look, I I've been
[94:53] a fan and and an admirer of your podcast
[94:55] for a long time and uh and also your
[94:58] videos. So, thank you very much for
[94:59] having me on. I really appreciate it.
[95:01] the the pleasure was mine and I look
[95:03] forward to doing it again hopefully with
[95:04] some some great updates about uh
[95:07] shockingly positive advancements in the
[95:09] UK's stance on Bitcoin policy. I'm I'm
[95:12] an optimist as well. Brilliant. We
[95:15] should all go. Amen to that. Thanks so
[95:18] much, Freddie. Thanks again. All the
[95:20] best.
