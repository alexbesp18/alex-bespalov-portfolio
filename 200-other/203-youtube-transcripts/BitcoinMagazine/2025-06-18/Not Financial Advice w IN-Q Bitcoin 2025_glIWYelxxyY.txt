[00:00] How you guys doing? You feel good?
[00:04] Come on, we can get some more energy in
[00:05] here. Are you alive? Do you feel awake?
[00:11] All right. I go by Inq. I'm a poet and a
[00:14] songwriter and an author and a speaker.
[00:17] And I wrote this piece a while back
[00:21] and no one's ever heard it. So, it's an
[00:24] honor to share it with you tonight.
[00:30] Bitcoin doesn't care about our nations.
[00:35] It doesn't care about the boundaries
[00:37] drawn by our imaginations.
[00:41] It doesn't care about our flags or our
[00:43] affiliations.
[00:45] It won't acknowledge differences. It
[00:48] sees no separations.
[00:51] It won't discriminate by city, state,
[00:54] country, or continent.
[00:57] It has no opinions, no beliefs, no
[01:00] language, and no argument. It doesn't
[01:03] have one.
[01:05] It doesn't want to change your mind.
[01:08] It doesn't have a strategy or legacy to
[01:11] leave behind.
[01:15] Bitcoin is the truth.
[01:18] Not my truth or your truth or even our
[01:23] truth. It is the truth.
[01:26] It is math.
[01:28] It is not an opinion someone has. It is
[01:31] a fact.
[01:33] It is a bridge between the future and
[01:36] past.
[01:37] It is a way to make our value last.
[01:41] It is a bank account in cyerspace away
[01:44] from any central banks or nation states
[01:46] that print the fiat currency devaluing
[01:48] what people make. And make no mistake,
[01:50] it's no mistake.
[01:54] Money represents time.
[01:57] If they expand the supply, your money's
[02:00] worth less over time, which means your
[02:04] time is worth less over time. Inflation
[02:08] is a consequence of legalized crime.
[02:11] They are stealing our lives. That's how
[02:14] the systems designed. So every year a
[02:17] dollar made and saved is losing what a
[02:19] dime. And this adds up over time as
[02:21] purchase power declines, which makes
[02:24] stock markets rise next to unemployment
[02:26] lines. And even if we get ahead, we're
[02:29] always one step behind because we're
[02:31] underneath their bottom line.
[02:39] We're hypnotized
[02:42] until we only follow dollar signs.
[02:46] We put ourselves in debt on credit lines
[02:48] and borrow just to fund our picture
[02:50] perfect lives.
[02:53] We borrow why? So we can buy something
[02:56] that we don't like and pressing people
[02:58] we don't like. Then put off paying full
[03:00] price until the interest rates are
[03:01] hiked. We wind up paying twice. But 2020
[03:05] brought us hindsight. It's like the
[03:08] blind leading the blind, right?
[03:13] They sent us checks that we paid for
[03:15] ourselves after the supermarket doubled
[03:17] all the food they put on shelves. And
[03:19] since everything's financialized,
[03:21] everyone's incentivized to spend their
[03:24] cash on assets or invest in something
[03:26] centralized. It's getting harder to
[03:29] survive. But we're distracted cuz the
[03:32] revolution's televised. It's interactive
[03:35] cuz the world is dematerialized. It's
[03:38] all online. So they feed us lies in real
[03:40] time while we pretend we feel fine.
[03:43] [Applause]
[03:50] But Bitcoin doesn't care.
[03:56] It doesn't brag. It doesn't boast. It
[03:59] doesn't want to drive a Lambo next to
[04:01] the Amalfi Coast. You will never make it
[04:05] happy. It's not up when it's up. It
[04:08] doesn't have a fragile ego or a need to
[04:11] be loved. It doesn't want to moon. It
[04:14] doesn't want to mine with diamond hands.
[04:17] It just does block after block. It has
[04:20] no other plans. You will never hurt its
[04:23] feelings. It's not down when it's down.
[04:25] It doesn't want your validation. It just
[04:28] solves the next equation.
[04:32] And that's what makes it so special.
[04:37] No one controls what it will be.
[04:40] Is it a global store of value or digital
[04:44] property?
[04:45] Is it the internet's first real native
[04:48] currency? Is it all of the above or
[04:52] something we have yet to see? Cuz no
[04:55] matter what it is, you can't deny that
[04:58] it is free.
[05:03] [Applause]
[05:06] And isn't that democracy disguised as a
[05:09] technology?
[05:13] Isn't that a tool to tackle rising
[05:16] inequality?
[05:20] Isn't that a moral reason to be using
[05:23] energy?
[05:28] Imagine you're in Venezuela and the
[05:30] Bolivar is tanked. Imagine you're in
[05:32] Argentina and they're running on the
[05:35] banks. Imagine you're Ukrainian and
[05:37] watching incoming tanks. You either stay
[05:40] and fight or leave with only what your
[05:42] bags can bring. A refugee without a
[05:45] home, without a land, without your
[05:47] things. So you carry all you own as you
[05:50] flee with your beliefs. But now imagine
[05:53] you had everything you'd saved inside
[05:55] your mind. So you can take it with you
[05:57] even as you leave the rest behind. You
[05:59] can store it on a USB or memorize a line
[06:02] so it redefineses the very meaning of
[06:04] the word mine.
[06:07] [Applause]
[06:14] See, strangely no one's noticed yet, but
[06:16] BTC's the only tech without a CEO, PR
[06:20] team, or offices.
[06:23] That's why maxis market through
[06:25] obnoxious memes and call it work.
[06:29] Bitcoin is a decentralized global
[06:31] monetary system protected by an
[06:34] incorruptible software that's defended
[06:36] by a distributed network which is hard
[06:38] to fit on a shirt.
[06:43] Let's go with Bitcoin is hope
[06:46] or have fun staying broke. It's like a
[06:49] digital immune system that's protecting
[06:52] the host, but the host doesn't care.
[07:00] It never has. It never will.
[07:03] It doesn't celebrate success. It doesn't
[07:06] want to close the deal. It's not on your
[07:09] side or my side. It doesn't have a side,
[07:13] so it's on every side, which makes it an
[07:15] idea that will never die.
[07:21] Thank you so much for listening. My name
[07:23] is Enq.
