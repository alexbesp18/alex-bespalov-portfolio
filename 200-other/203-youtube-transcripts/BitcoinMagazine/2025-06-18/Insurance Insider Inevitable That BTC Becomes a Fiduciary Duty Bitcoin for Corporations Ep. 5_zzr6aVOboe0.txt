[00:00] There will be a time in the future where
[00:02] the fiduciary duty of not owning Bitcoin
[00:05] on your balance sheet will create
[00:07] shareholder litigation because once the
[00:09] investor community understands the math,
[00:12] right, not your opinion, not my opinion,
[00:14] just look at the math, you are not
[00:16] really doing your fiduciary duty if you
[00:18] don't find some way to incorporate
[00:20] Bitcoin into your treasury strategy in
[00:22] some form or fashion. Right? That to me
[00:23] is inevitably going to happen.
[00:30] Welcome to the Bitcoin for Corporations
[00:32] show. I'm joined today by Garrett
[00:34] Johnston from Marsh, a global insurance
[00:37] broker. Uh so uh really wanted to have
[00:40] you on uh to to talk about Bitcoin uh
[00:43] and how it fits into the corporate
[00:45] landscape in the year 2025.
[00:48] um you have a very unique background. Uh
[00:51] not a lot of Bitcoiners are necessarily
[00:53] familiar uh with the world of insurance
[00:56] and then uh all the specializations
[00:59] within that. Um but first I really want
[01:01] to start by uh your Bitcoin journey and
[01:04] how how you eventually uh got to learn
[01:07] about Bitcoin and and become intrigued
[01:09] by it.
[01:11] Perfect. Um yeah, so I've been um in the
[01:15] commercial insurance space for 25 years.
[01:17] Uh I started out in 1999 as an insurance
[01:21] underwriter um for a large carrier. Uh
[01:24] and I was in their what they called
[01:25] their financial institutions group and
[01:27] primarily what I underwrote for the
[01:29] first decade of my career was typical
[01:32] Trati companies um insurance companies.
[01:36] I would write their own ENO, directors
[01:38] and officers risk uh their crime. I
[01:41] would write stock exchanges, banks,
[01:43] investment advisors, etc. Um and then
[01:48] did that uh worked for some insurance
[01:50] brokerages. So in the insurance world,
[01:52] you it's kind of akin to um when you
[01:55] shop for a mortgage, oftentimes you will
[01:57] use a broker to shop multiple markets
[02:00] and bring you the best uh mortgage rate.
[02:02] In the commercial insurance world, you
[02:04] typically use a broker who goes to 20 to
[02:08] 40 carriers, gets the best price,
[02:10] negotiates the terms, etc. Um, so that's
[02:12] the world I've lived in. Um, very
[02:15] corporate, very conservative being
[02:17] within the insurance space. Um, and then
[02:20] in 2019 2020 is when I really kind of
[02:25] first discovered Bitcoin. Um, kind of
[02:28] did the usual where I played around with
[02:30] some of the altcoins. the first year,
[02:33] learned a lot and then kind of got my
[02:35] Bitcoin not uh not crypto conviction
[02:38] really in in 2020. Um
[02:42] and I ultimately I decided to stay
[02:44] within insurance because there was a
[02:46] point where I was thinking of getting
[02:47] out um just because that as that
[02:49] conviction level built within Bitcoin, I
[02:52] wanted to build there and and do
[02:53] something in that space. Um, but I also
[02:56] just, you know, I just realized how much
[02:57] of a disconnect
[03:00] between the use case of Bitcoin and the
[03:03] insurance industry there is. Uh, and so
[03:06] that was 2020 and I've pretty much been
[03:09] focused um pretty heavily in that in
[03:12] that space as far as like where does
[03:13] insurance and Bitcoin intersect. Uh, and
[03:17] things obviously have changed quite a
[03:18] bit with the new administration. you
[03:20] know, we basically went from
[03:22] antagonistic headwinds towards digital
[03:24] assets to uh tailwinds. Um, and so here
[03:28] we are, we've got all these treasury
[03:30] companies populating. Um, but as we sit
[03:32] here today, there's like there's the the
[03:33] kind of Wall Street corporate
[03:35] institutional money that sees all the
[03:39] growth in Bitcoin and digital assets,
[03:40] but really is not connecting the dots on
[03:43] where Bitcoin makes things better. And
[03:46] then we have a ton of very um fast
[03:50] growing scaling kind of Bitcoin native
[03:53] builders um that I'm sitting there kind
[03:55] of cheering on as as both an investor
[03:57] and just a Bitcoiner. Um but there's
[03:59] this massive divide between the
[04:01] institutional space in the insurance
[04:03] side and the builders. And I think the
[04:06] treasury company operations are very
[04:08] interesting because they are um outside
[04:11] of Micro Strategy which obviously is
[04:12] like trailblazed and and created a lot
[04:14] of space for these companies to operate.
[04:16] Um they're kind of the first ones really
[04:20] jumping right into the middle of things
[04:22] because going public from an insurance
[04:25] standpoint uh you go from kind of not
[04:28] having a target on your back to having a
[04:30] pretty big target on your back. a lot of
[04:32] corporate governance expectations and
[04:35] downside risk. Uh so your risk vector
[04:37] landscape just completely kind of
[04:39] mushrooms when you go from the private
[04:41] sector into the public sector. And as
[04:44] Bitcoin kind of bleeds into traditional
[04:47] Wall Street, there's there's a ton
[04:50] that's traditionally been done from an
[04:52] insurance risk mitigation standpoint um
[04:55] that is not understood by the Bitcoin
[04:56] community. And then frankly the use case
[04:58] for Bitcoin as kind of an arbitrage
[05:01] against inflation and managing risk over
[05:04] long duration is completely missed on
[05:06] the whole by the insurance community. So
[05:08] that's a lot of where I am really trying
[05:10] to spend my time is being that um
[05:13] educator on both sides uh bridgeuer and
[05:16] dot connector because that that is what
[05:19] is desperately needed uh kind of between
[05:21] those two worlds. So, if I'm hearing
[05:23] that right, the the two sides are the
[05:25] asset management side of the float, that
[05:29] is um all of the assets that are backing
[05:31] the potential future insurance claims um
[05:35] and that there's an opportunity for
[05:36] Bitcoin to uh help on that side of
[05:40] meeting their mandate. And then the
[05:42] other side is on the insurance side,
[05:45] developing insurance products that are
[05:48] fit for purpose for Bitcoin clients. uh
[05:51] that that do need those services. Is
[05:54] that fair to say? Yeah. Yeah. There's um
[05:57] there there is there's a myriad of kind
[06:00] of places to dig into from an insurance
[06:03] standpoint, but yeah, those those first
[06:05] two are some of the big ones. So, um the
[06:08] insurance community does not really
[06:12] appreciate yet what a Bitcoin allocation
[06:15] in any investment portfolio uh performs
[06:19] over time, right? So, particularly
[06:21] within insurance, you have um a whole
[06:23] gamut of products. You have certain
[06:25] things that are short duration. So,
[06:27] again, like an auto accident, you know
[06:29] that you've got to fix your bumper when
[06:31] you get in a an auto crash. Um but like
[06:34] a workers's comp claim where maybe
[06:35] you've been lifting boxes in a warehouse
[06:37] for 5 years and and there's a lot of
[06:39] this long duration type risk. There's
[06:41] things like reinsurance. There's nat,
[06:43] hurricanes, wildfires that uh have long
[06:46] duration risk. And most of the insurance
[06:48] community for the most part they take
[06:49] those premiums in right then they have
[06:52] their the float is when you dollar in
[06:54] before you have to pay the dollar out on
[06:56] the claim side. Um that float depending
[06:58] on your duration oftentimes is just
[07:00] invested in cash and cash equivalents
[07:02] treasuries etc. Um, and as we all know,
[07:05] um, and be you do such a good job of
[07:07] kind of like outlining the the problems
[07:08] with some of this stuff is
[07:11] that's that's a pretty dysfunctional
[07:12] melting ice cube that these big
[07:14] institutional pools of capital like
[07:15] insurance companies have and how do they
[07:19] um harness something like Bitcoin to
[07:21] improve their loss trajectory over time.
[07:25] So again, it, you know, just
[07:27] theoretically you put a 5% allocation
[07:29] into Bitcoin. You don't have to uh go
[07:32] super high conviction, but just do a
[07:33] single digit allocation. And as you
[07:35] model that out over a multi-year
[07:37] duration portfolio, like the loss
[07:39] history just is it's higher profit, uh
[07:42] higher performance toward the insurance
[07:43] companies. And that helps them manage
[07:45] risk. And frankly, that's good for the
[07:47] consumer, too, because at the end of the
[07:48] day, whether you're a corporation or an
[07:50] individual buying your homeowners or
[07:52] auto, um prices are, you know, Bitcoin's
[07:55] deflationary on most things, including
[07:57] insurance, if if you price it out right
[07:59] and structure it correctly. Yeah. And
[08:01] and on the opposite end, I've heard a
[08:04] lot of complaints that insurance rates
[08:06] have gone up a lot in dollar terms over
[08:08] the past several years. Um, I was
[08:10] recently in Florida and my Uber driver
[08:12] mentioned that uh he's going to have to
[08:15] move because he just can't afford the
[08:17] the hikes uh in in insurance rates. Um,
[08:21] so it's interesting you mentioned that
[08:23] Bitcoin could potentially help alleviate
[08:26] that rate pressure by having an asset
[08:29] that really performs well. Yeah. Uh like
[08:32] another one I was just I was talking
[08:34] about with a a guy who's on the policy
[08:36] side last week um is you take you take
[08:40] California right California wildfire
[08:41] risk is difficult right so the the way
[08:45] this has trended over time and in
[08:47] Florida coastal Florida same way for
[08:49] flood right two different uh cats um
[08:53] same problem but if you use Florida as
[08:54] just an example um or not Florida for
[08:57] California wildfire risk a lot of the
[09:00] carriers have left the state,
[09:03] not because they're unwilling to write
[09:05] in the state of California, but there's
[09:07] a there's a dysfunctional system that
[09:09] they have to operate in that does not
[09:10] allow them ultimately to make a profit.
[09:12] So, you know, oversimplifying it, but
[09:15] when you can boil it down like you are
[09:17] not allowed, you have to get approval by
[09:20] the state of California on rate
[09:22] increases if you're a if you're writing
[09:24] homeowners insurance in the state of
[09:25] California, right? So, if you see your
[09:28] portfolio deteriorating because of
[09:30] wildfire risk, you tend to say, "Hey,
[09:32] I'm going to need," you just do the
[09:33] math, and the math will say, "I need to
[09:35] increase rates by 15%." Let's just
[09:37] assume that's the case. The regulators
[09:39] might come in and say, "That's price
[09:41] gouging. We don't like it. We're only
[09:43] going to allow you to do 5%." Well, you
[09:45] just do the math and you're like, "I
[09:47] won't make a profit." And in the, you
[09:50] know, public, this is where we get kind
[09:51] of into directors and officers
[09:52] insurance. At the end of the day, if
[09:54] you're a publicly traded company, which
[09:56] most of these carriers are, when you
[09:58] boil everything down to the baseline,
[09:59] your duty is shareholder value. It's not
[10:02] covering clients, right? Same
[10:04] dysfunction in the health care system.
[10:06] But if you can't make your rates
[10:07] profitable, your only option is to exit
[10:09] the state. And so in California, they
[10:11] have the state funded, it's called the
[10:13] fair plan, right? And the irony there is
[10:16] the fair plan, I I don't have the
[10:18] numbers off the top of my head, but it's
[10:20] exceptionally underfunded.
[10:22] And the vast majority of the float
[10:25] that's brought in by the fair plan is
[10:27] cash and cash equivalents, right? So
[10:29] that's a good example of a dysfunctional
[10:30] system where Bitcoin could help fix the
[10:35] California fair plan. It's just one
[10:37] example, right? It's just like very much
[10:38] a vacuum and there's millions of these
[10:40] use cases across the insurance industry.
[10:43] Um I wanted to touch on you you had
[10:46] mentioned kind of the carrier product
[10:48] fix within Bitcoin companies, right? But
[10:52] before we get to that, I wanted to see
[10:54] uh uh on what order of magnitude would
[10:57] you say the the total insurance float
[10:59] out there is? Uh is it in the billions
[11:02] or in the trillions? I believe it is in
[11:06] the tr it's in it's in the trillions. It
[11:08] kind of depends if you're looking at
[11:09] like North America versus global, right?
[11:11] When you get global, it's it's in the
[11:13] trillions. So it it's massive. And a lot
[11:15] of the um you know a lot of the
[11:17] insurance capacity is global capacity
[11:19] whether they're doiciled in Europe like
[11:21] an alons or they're doiciled in the US
[11:23] like an AIG or a CHOP um they all write
[11:26] global uh risks out there um but it's a
[11:29] it's a massive amount right and so it's
[11:32] um there there's just a huge opportunity
[11:35] over time uh for Bitcoin to kind of
[11:39] solve some of these um kind of just
[11:41] pernitious inflation issues because
[11:43] carriers are getting hit with the same
[11:44] inflation issues of um you know it costs
[11:48] a lot more to get back surgery these
[11:49] days than it did and that's ultimately
[11:52] underlied in in inflation. There's um
[11:55] inflation and just getting your car
[11:56] fixed, right? There's inflation is kind
[11:58] of all over the place. And then
[12:00] particularly when you when you look at
[12:02] you know the broken fiat system, it's
[12:04] just rife with issues, right? So, one of
[12:07] the uh dysfunctions out there in the US
[12:11] is not only do you have topline nominal
[12:14] inflation, but you have what's kind of
[12:15] referred to as social inflation in the
[12:17] industry. And that is where jury
[12:19] verdicts on claims that go to jury trial
[12:23] are getting
[12:25] really dislocated from reality. So, you
[12:27] and and you also have um litigation
[12:30] funding. So, hedge funds are are
[12:31] starting to fund some of these claims
[12:33] because they're taking a cut of the jury
[12:35] verdict. So it's just a good example of
[12:39] a broken system. Perverse incentive
[12:41] structures create perverse outcomes. Not
[12:44] for the benefit, you know, betterment of
[12:45] society. It kind of just works against
[12:47] everybody. It works against the
[12:48] carriers, ultimately works against the
[12:50] clients at the end of the day. And
[12:51] that's where there there's a lot of
[12:54] opportunity to do better. Wish you could
[12:56] access cash without selling your
[12:57] Bitcoin? Letin is the global leader in
[12:59] Bitcoinbacked lending. They've issued
[13:01] over 9 billion in loans since 2018 and
[13:04] never lost a single satoshi of client
[13:06] assets. A leaden loan is different. With
[13:09] custody loans, collateral is not lent
[13:11] out to generate interest. No credit
[13:13] checks, funds in under 12 hours with
[13:15] proof of reserves reports published
[13:17] every 6 months. Letin gives Bitcoin
[13:19] holders a secure and transparent way to
[13:21] unlock liquidity without selling. Learn
[13:23] more at letin.io.
[13:25] Yeah. And it's it's really sad because I
[13:27] think that there's this mentality that's
[13:29] taken hold of, oh well, if if it's the
[13:32] insurance company paying for something,
[13:34] then it doesn't matter what it costs.
[13:36] And they kind of gloss over the fact
[13:39] that that gets passed along in rates or
[13:42] in availability. It's not like a free
[13:44] lunch. Yeah. We refer to that in the
[13:47] industry as moral hazard. So, hey, I've
[13:48] got insurance. I'm not going to drive as
[13:50] careful. Or I've got insurance, so what
[13:51] if they sue me? Right. If you're running
[13:53] a business, right? Uh and to your point,
[13:54] that's exactly uh how it is. Insurance
[13:57] companies ultimately they want to make a
[13:59] fair return on investment. Usually it's,
[14:01] you know, 10 to 15% and their
[14:03] shareholders are happy. Um but kind of
[14:05] to that California example, if you can't
[14:07] make a profit, like you've got to deploy
[14:08] your capital elsewhere because you, you
[14:11] know, you're essentially looking for
[14:12] yield on the, you know, the premiums and
[14:14] and the the risk you deploy. Uh so it is
[14:17] it is um it's a problem when when it
[14:21] snowballs and it is it does come back to
[14:23] you right so you do want to be a good
[14:26] corporate citizen ultimately uh and
[14:28] that's part of a lot of what I spend my
[14:29] time in is how do I help companies
[14:32] navigate their corporate governance so
[14:34] particular like all these these
[14:35] companies with reverse mergers the
[14:37] Bitcoin treasury companies um
[14:40] they're getting into territory where the
[14:42] corporate governance and compliance
[14:44] really matters at this And if and if you
[14:46] don't pay attention to it, you could
[14:49] easily face a shareholder claim. And you
[14:52] know, like you know, Micro Strategy got
[14:53] sued recently, right? Shareholder claim.
[14:55] And like if you actually read through
[14:57] that one, that's just a good example of
[14:59] like you don't have to be wrong. You can
[15:01] be sued and it's going to take you
[15:03] several million dollars just to deal
[15:05] with that claim in legal fees, right?
[15:07] Because like as a Bitcoiner, when I look
[15:09] at some of the the the reasons for the
[15:12] complaint, um they're kind of silly,
[15:15] right? Particularly when we're looking
[15:16] ahead of what likely the Q2 revenue is
[15:19] going to look like coming out of that
[15:20] exact same company, right? Um but that's
[15:23] the reality you live in. Like often
[15:25] times you get sued on allegations
[15:29] whether they're there's much truth to
[15:31] them. You got to deal with them. And
[15:33] they're you in the public company
[15:34] setting like it takes you510 million
[15:37] dollars just to deal and get a get a
[15:39] motion to dismiss like it is not and
[15:42] there's inflation pressure on the legal
[15:44] fees too. So when I started in the
[15:46] business ridiculously high white glove
[15:49] legal fees were like 500 bucks an hour.
[15:53] Then it jumped we there was a point in
[15:55] time we were like I cannot believe these
[15:57] firms are charging a,000 an hour. We're
[15:59] well past 2,000 an hour now. Wow. Yeah.
[16:02] So it's like you see inflation all over
[16:04] the place and at the end of the day
[16:07] the carriers have to fund for that risk
[16:10] and so that's where it rates you know
[16:13] rates are just a derivative of you know
[16:16] insurance is in some ways a derivative
[16:18] mirror of the litigation environment out
[16:19] there. you know, property cat loss is
[16:22] going to be more the um the envir
[16:24] environmental act aspects, but when you
[16:26] get into DNO litigation um suits against
[16:30] the board of directors for
[16:31] mismanagement, that really is just a
[16:33] it's a function of the litigation
[16:34] landscape.
[16:36] Uh yeah. So, it's really interesting
[16:39] that that you you bring up the the
[16:41] governance aspect of it because this is
[16:44] um I think a a conversation that that
[16:46] has been going on online is concerns
[16:49] about the Bitcoin treasury companies and
[16:51] corporate adoption of Bitcoin as um
[16:55] being comparable to past manas in the
[17:00] crypto world. So people will point to
[17:03] ICOs or they'll point to FTX, the you
[17:07] know offshore exchange um and and
[17:11] they'll compare that to a publicly
[17:13] traded company where um so my background
[17:16] of accounting and public accounting and
[17:18] and you know having uh worked at at
[17:20] Deote and uh kind of seen the insight on
[17:23] the Trafy system uh and working on
[17:27] internal controls specifically as well.
[17:29] Um I I have this gut reaction of what an
[17:32] absurd comparison because a a lot of the
[17:35] critique of ICOs and of FTX was the lack
[17:40] of governance, the lack of risk
[17:43] management, the lack of audits and all
[17:46] of these good corporate practices.
[17:49] um and that what you're describing it's
[17:52] it's almost the opposite where they're
[17:54] under too much scrutiny in the sense
[17:56] that it's unfair uh unwarranted scrutiny
[17:59] of a frivolous lawsuit, right? And so,
[18:02] um, it's it's fascinating to to see kind
[18:05] of the difference between the narrative
[18:07] that some might have about, uh, that
[18:10] this is, uh, some kind of, uh,
[18:13] uncontrolled mania comparable to ICOs
[18:16] where there was no accountability and
[18:19] those management teams did squander the
[18:21] funds that they raised uh, and that the
[18:23] SEC, you know, had to crack down on
[18:25] that. Yeah, it really it is a
[18:27] fascinating dichotomy and it's it's very
[18:30] illustrative of the knowledge gap that's
[18:34] out there. So in my day job dealing with
[18:37] insurance carriers um helping Bitcoin
[18:40] denominated uh or Bitcoin kind of
[18:43] adjacent companies um get insurance like
[18:46] it is very common for me to have for a
[18:50] given risk in a normal non-bitcoin
[18:52] denominated pier. I might have 40
[18:55] markets that I can arbitrage against
[18:57] each other, get the best terms, say,
[18:59] "Hey, do this because you're
[19:00] competitors. You're going to do it.
[19:01] You're not going to get the deal. If you
[19:02] don't, get the pricing down." As soon as
[19:05] you mention, you know, I'll say digital
[19:07] assets on a whole. Um because Bitcoin,
[19:09] like from an insurance standpoint, um
[19:11] I'm very much a Bitcoiner, but in the
[19:14] corporate insurance world, Bitcoin is
[19:17] just considered a digital loss. is just
[19:18] considered the biggest one, but there's
[19:20] there's very little um distinction
[19:23] between Bitcoin and all the other
[19:25] cryptos. So, I still very much deal
[19:28] with, well, how do I know it's not
[19:30] Bitcoin is not going to be the next FTX?
[19:32] Right. Right. And the irony to me is the
[19:35] I was an underwriter that would ensure
[19:38] exchanges like
[19:40] traditional FTXs. So, like whether it
[19:42] was like an Erade or ESAB or Fidelity,
[19:44] something like that. those those were
[19:45] the clients I would ensure in my early
[19:48] days. Uh and to your point, it was all
[19:50] about audit controls, controls and
[19:52] procedures, all that kind of stuff. Uh
[19:55] and FDX, I I kind of always joke like
[19:58] FDX was 1980s fraud. It had nothing to
[20:01] do with the tech. What he arbitrageed
[20:04] with was the lack of regulatory
[20:07] framework around it. But he
[20:09] rehypothecated and he embezzled
[20:12] that that does not take the technology.
[20:14] he just exploited the regulatory
[20:16] framework in my mind um on on that uh
[20:19] that whole fiasco. So we're we're still
[20:22] dealing with the residue of that and I
[20:24] still deal with the ESG FUD on Bitcoin
[20:27] miners, right? So, like I love the uh
[20:30] you know, you've got such a great piece
[20:31] you did a few years ago when you're at
[20:33] Riot with your CO2 monitor going around
[20:36] and completely just debunking the whole
[20:39] uh you know, greenhouse gas FUD that was
[20:41] really rampant at the time uh out there
[20:43] in the industry. So, that we're still
[20:46] dealing with that today. And I think you
[20:49] know the insurance community
[20:52] is usually the one left holding the bag
[20:54] on a lot of these things. So like the
[20:56] insurance community is still paying out
[20:58] on some of these, you know, FDX era
[21:02] fiascos. Um they so they have long
[21:05] memories and there's just kind of some
[21:06] residue within there where they don't
[21:10] they still think Bitcoin is going to be
[21:13] it's just going to be the next FTX. It's
[21:15] going to be a different flavor, right?
[21:17] Um and then it you know we kind of get
[21:19] into
[21:21] uh like a micro strategy play. I
[21:23] completely agree with you that is um
[21:26] there's all this FUD around they're
[21:29] taking on debt. It's going to be
[21:30] callable. There's liquidation risk. It's
[21:32] and they just there's a complete lack of
[21:34] understanding of the flexibility
[21:38] that Sailor's built into his particular
[21:42] converts and then all these preferred
[21:44] shares. I look at that and I'm like once
[21:47] you kind of dig in and see his
[21:49] optionality and particularly with these
[21:51] ATM things like
[21:54] he is he is a completely different risk
[21:58] than your traditional
[22:01] raising debt you know tradi debt raising
[22:05] scenario but that is that is just very
[22:07] underappreciated and so where I play at
[22:11] that intersection is if it's not
[22:13] appreciated it is misunderstood and
[22:15] misunderstanding often leads in
[22:17] lawsuits, right? Micro Strategy, you
[22:19] know, their their lawsuit is to me a big
[22:22] misunderstanding of what I feel he's
[22:25] been um pretty abundantly clear on his
[22:29] strategy. Like in the DNO world, the
[22:32] directors and officers, that's when you
[22:33] get sued for alleged mismanagement. when
[22:35] you're public, it's usually some uh you
[22:39] know, some derivative of like a Monday
[22:41] morning quarterbacking of, hey, you did
[22:43] you should have disclosed this and you
[22:45] didn't, right? Um you said you were
[22:47] going to do this yet the results were
[22:49] this, which is kind of what the essence
[22:51] of that recent lawsuit is. And it
[22:54] doesn't take into it just shows a lack
[22:56] of understanding. But at the end of the
[22:57] day, there's a plaintiff firm that's
[23:00] bringing it. they're gonna they're going
[23:03] to get paid a decent amount of money and
[23:04] that's part of the perverse system that
[23:06] they're in. And that's that to me is
[23:07] what I spend a lot of time guiding the
[23:11] builders whether it's the Bitcoin
[23:13] treasury companies or the smaller
[23:14] companies of like, okay, you're growing
[23:16] great. We're in this kind of hyper
[23:18] bitcoinization. We have um a lot of top
[23:22] down support from the government now.
[23:24] You're getting into new territory.
[23:26] there's a whole new risk landscape that
[23:28] opens up that you need to be prepared
[23:31] for and use some of those lessons from
[23:34] the trad space because you know I get to
[23:38] see all the dirty laundry of these
[23:39] companies as do the carriers when stuff
[23:42] hits the fan right and everybody's moved
[23:43] on from FTX we're still seeing seeing
[23:46] some of the fallout from some of those
[23:48] spaces so
[23:50] so uh mechanically h how what what is
[23:53] that DNO insurance and how does it work
[23:55] in a situation like this. Yeah. So,
[23:57] director chrison and officers insurance
[23:59] um it's usually structured in kind of a
[24:01] threepillar format of the coverage. Uh
[24:04] we refer to the in the industry as side
[24:06] A, side B, and side C. I'll kind of go
[24:09] backwards because I think it's easier to
[24:10] articulate that way. Um you have
[24:12] individuals, the individual directors,
[24:15] and you have the company, right? So, you
[24:16] have balance sheet exposure and you have
[24:18] individual exposure. So, a directors and
[24:21] officers policy will cover the balance
[24:23] sheet of the company. Um, so it's going
[24:26] to cover uh the company as an entity
[24:28] because in legal terms the uh you know
[24:30] entity is a person in in in law and then
[24:33] it's also going to cover that's the side
[24:35] C cover. Then you get over into side B
[24:38] and A. B is covering the individual
[24:40] directors and officers when they are
[24:43] indemnified by the company. And most
[24:46] companies in bylaws uh say they'll fully
[24:48] indemnify you to the extent allowable by
[24:52] law. Right? If you if you knowingly do
[24:54] fraud and are criminal acts and you
[24:55] can't indemnify for that, then you get
[24:57] to side A. Side A is what we call
[24:59] non-enddemnifiable
[25:02] insurance. So that is when uh either
[25:04] they can't indemnify you, won't
[25:07] indemnify you, which again won't is
[25:09] usually pretty rare unless there's
[25:11] criminal, you know, knowing fraud. The
[25:13] won't part is usually a solveny issue.
[25:16] So even though you could get covered by
[25:19] the balance sheet, they're bankrupt or
[25:22] they're insolvent. So the DNO is really
[25:24] really important to the directors and
[25:27] officers of the company because in many
[25:29] ways it acts as the financial backs stop
[25:33] for the individual directors. I mean it
[25:34] is the thing that ultimately helps them
[25:37] pay their legal fees when the company
[25:38] blows up and goes bankrupt. Um and it
[25:41] also stands in and it softens some of
[25:43] those legal fees down the road. So it's
[25:45] it's a really important cover for public
[25:48] companies in particular.
[25:50] Is it purely about civil litigation from
[25:53] shareholders? Uh it depends on where you
[25:56] are in your cycle. So in the private
[25:58] company space oftent times the entity
[26:01] covers
[26:03] the entity for a whole host of issues.
[26:06] Typically it could be private
[26:08] shareholders. So it could be VC backers.
[26:10] It could be anti-competitive
[26:12] uh like antirust issues. uh when you get
[26:14] into the public space typically the
[26:16] coverage for the entity gets isolated
[26:19] solely to shareholder claims which
[26:21] that's where nine10en of your exposure
[26:23] is. So that's always something in
[26:24] insurance that um is is not well
[26:27] understood. It's partly why I think
[26:30] often times people are a little too
[26:32] binary when they think about these
[26:34] things. So I have insurance, I'm covered
[26:37] and then they're frustrated when it's
[26:39] not covered, right? And the reality is
[26:41] insurance
[26:43] is a tool. It's not a solution. So it's
[26:45] a way to cover off some things, but
[26:47] they're not going to cover others. And
[26:50] over time and with case law, if carriers
[26:52] cannot underwrite and kind of
[26:55] encapsulate the risk and price for it,
[26:57] they'll exclude it, right? So like, um,
[27:01] I'll give you a good example of one of
[27:02] the ways they'll either exclude it or
[27:04] they'll sublimmit it heavily. So a
[27:07] supplement is simply if you buy a $10
[27:08] million policy, they might have a
[27:10] supplement for a million dollars for a
[27:13] piece of the risk that is really
[27:15] difficult for them to wrap their their
[27:17] arms around. So in the kind of crime
[27:20] cyber space, this uh this coverage of
[27:22] social engineering is is an example
[27:24] that's often. So those are fishing
[27:26] attacks. Those are any kind of um kind
[27:28] of clickbait type of scenarios that try
[27:31] to get you to transfer funds um in a
[27:33] fraudulent way. very very very difficult
[27:37] to underwrite around and very difficult
[27:40] to ensure. So they supplement that
[27:43] pretty heavily in this space. So that's
[27:44] an example of can you find the coverage
[27:47] out there? Yes. Um is it going to be
[27:48] supplemented? Yes. Could you
[27:51] theoretically buy a lot more insurance
[27:52] for it? You could, but it's usually cost
[27:55] prohibitive. Um punitive damages is
[27:58] another one depending on the the um the
[28:01] policy, depending on the jurisdiction.
[28:03] Some jurisdictions don't allow you to
[28:05] insure for punitive damages. Um, and
[28:07] then there's a whole host of ways to do
[28:10] insurance products around that. You can
[28:11] do offshore puny wraps outside of the
[28:13] United States as one example, but
[28:16] insurance is got a whole plethora of
[28:18] ways you can deal with risk. But as I
[28:20] always tell clients, like risk comes for
[28:22] you whether you insure it or not. It's a
[28:24] tradeoff you have to make. And just
[28:27] because insurance is available doesn't
[28:28] mean it's economically viable. And just
[28:31] because you can purchase insurance
[28:32] doesn't mean you necessarily should.
[28:34] You've got to think through the pros,
[28:35] cons, trade-offs. Uh, in that scenario,
[28:39] um, Bitcoin custody insurance is a is a
[28:41] very, um,
[28:44] similar space where they're the amount
[28:47] of, you know, a lot of these custody
[28:48] firms like to say, "Yeah, we have
[28:49] insurance, right?"
[28:52] Yes, they do. Uh, but the insurance is
[28:54] very specific, very narrow for certain
[28:56] factors. And I think there's a pretty
[28:58] big underappreciation of what's not
[28:59] actually covered um in those insurance
[29:01] policies for the most part.
[29:04] And do does the pricing change a lot
[29:06] based on the riskiness of the industry?
[29:09] Right? So if they might look at for
[29:11] example uh covering Boeing where they
[29:15] might have an airplane accident that
[29:17] would lead to shareholder litigation
[29:19] would be different than something more
[29:21] plain vanilla. Yes. Um, and a lot of
[29:24] that is is kind of orders of magnitude.
[29:26] So, at the highest level, insurers want
[29:31] regulatory stability and they want
[29:34] structure because at the end of the day,
[29:35] the you know, as I grew up as an
[29:37] underwriter early days, so like my job
[29:38] was to um meet a bank, interview their
[29:43] CFO and their kind of controllers and
[29:45] and go through all and my job was to how
[29:47] broad am I going to make the coverage
[29:49] and how much am I going to charge them?
[29:51] And my job was if I charge you $100,000
[29:55] five years in a row, um, I better have
[29:59] whatever I charged you minus claims
[30:02] should be less, right? That'd be our
[30:03] combined ratio. So combined ratio of 100
[30:06] means for every dollar you bring in,
[30:08] you're paying out on the back end in
[30:10] claims. So you want your combined ratio
[30:11] to be, you know, 90% 85%. So you're
[30:16] making margin of what you do. um that
[30:20] that ultimately is the game of of
[30:23] underwriting. So that's the challenge
[30:24] that all these companies have. If you
[30:27] don't have a structured regulatory
[30:28] environment, how are you going to price
[30:30] your risk? Right? It's akin to like in
[30:34] fiat world, like for us Bitcoiners, um
[30:37] how are you going to value risk in US
[30:40] dollars when the Fed like this can just
[30:42] debase the currency overnight? Right.
[30:44] Right. The short answer is you can't.
[30:46] Right. Uh, and that's where Bitcoin
[30:48] fixes it where and again lost on the
[30:51] insurance community as a whole right
[30:53] now. They're they're they're sitting
[30:56] there in this broken fiat system where
[30:59] they're trying to wrestle with inflation
[31:02] yet they're kind of ignoring on the one
[31:03] end as of most non- Bitcoiners are that
[31:06] this inflation dynamic of printing of
[31:09] money at will is creating all the
[31:12] downside problems. Right? you do
[31:14] something in a Bitcoin framework,
[31:16] you know, to Jeff Boo's point, it's like
[31:18] everything goes deflationary at that
[31:19] point, right? But it's we've not had the
[31:24] regulatory framework.
[31:26] I mean, if anything if anything, we've
[31:28] had an antagonistic framework all over
[31:30] the map until the new administration.
[31:32] So, I think the best thing that the
[31:34] administration does is just they they've
[31:36] simply said, "We're going to try to get
[31:40] this right." And you know, no, no
[31:42] administration with their best effort is
[31:43] going to get it perfect. But the fact
[31:46] that we're even in an environment where
[31:48] it's not just Trump but all of his
[31:50] cabinet are basically committed to
[31:53] putting a digital asset framework that
[31:55] is like that will set the stage for
[31:59] insurance capital to come in because for
[32:02] a lot of the Bitcoin native companies
[32:04] the custody firms right now 99% of the
[32:08] insurance capacity doesn't sit in the US
[32:10] it's Lloyds of London it's Bermuda it's
[32:13] other offshore juris jurisdictions that
[32:15] are just a little bit more flexible. Um,
[32:19] and we really need to get to a point
[32:21] where the large European and US domin
[32:24] denominated insurance companies uh jump
[32:28] in. That will really bring price
[32:30] pressure down. Um, but you have to have
[32:32] regulatory framework first before we get
[32:35] there. So that's where the like the
[32:37] market structure the bill um stuff that
[32:40] Senator Lumus is doing um those are part
[32:44] of the arc that are in the important
[32:47] groundwork cornerstones that need to be
[32:50] done before I think you know the the
[32:52] standard market you know participants
[32:54] will really come in at scale. Um, so
[32:57] we're still, you know, it's a long
[32:58] journey that we're on, but we're kind of
[33:01] in the best position we've ever been
[33:03] because we have buyin on Capitol Hill
[33:06] for the first time. So that that to me
[33:08] is is
[33:10] really important and it's and it's why I
[33:12] think we're seeing such a kind of um
[33:15] this kind of pent-up demand as soon as
[33:17] the new administration came in. We've
[33:19] seen all this growth in digital assets,
[33:21] right? BTC treasury companies being just
[33:23] a perfect example of of
[33:26] Now's the time for for that that kind of
[33:29] dynamic to take place. And and the the
[33:33] Black Rockck ETF as well uh getting
[33:35] approved last year, I think on the
[33:37] institutional side was hugely
[33:38] validating. But um do you think that
[33:41] it's a challenge for companies wanting
[33:44] to adopt Bitcoin on their balance sheet
[33:47] having concerns about the risk of
[33:50] shareholder litigation and the impact on
[33:52] their DNO insurance? Yeah, it's tough
[33:54] because it really is about um kind of
[33:57] the investment relations side of things.
[34:00] Um and like I I think
[34:03] uh I think Daniel Batton did a post that
[34:05] I thought was very um appropriate for
[34:08] what I see in the space and he was kind
[34:09] of talking about I um Meta's latest, you
[34:12] know, shootown of a uh their Bitcoin
[34:15] Treasury uh proposal within their
[34:17] shareholder meeting. um and he kind of
[34:19] made the argument that it's the same
[34:22] institutional shareholder base that shot
[34:24] down Microsoft and some of the others
[34:27] because they're just not quite there
[34:29] yet. Right? So I think there's a
[34:32] difference when um you know Sailor in
[34:35] many ways a micro strategy he had the
[34:36] luxury of being um he holds such a large
[34:40] proportion of the company and he did the
[34:42] work at the board level of like you know
[34:44] forcing them to read the Bitcoin
[34:45] standard and do the do the homework
[34:47] where they got it because you have to
[34:49] have conviction across the company. Um,
[34:52] and I think it was really important how
[34:54] he did the Dutch auction um, opportunity
[34:57] for when he made the announcement of,
[34:59] "Hey, if you're not on board with this
[35:01] shareholder, I'm going to give you a
[35:02] premium to get out because here's where
[35:04] we're going, but I'm going to give you a
[35:06] nice kind of friendly exit ramp." Um, I
[35:10] think, you know, there's a different
[35:11] case to be made for like the Strives,
[35:15] the 21s, the Nakamoto's where out of the
[35:17] gate they're saying we are Bitcoin,
[35:18] Bitcoin only. That's a different world
[35:21] because they're going to attract the
[35:22] investors that are already on board with
[35:25] that strategy. Where I think it gets
[35:27] tougher is um you know like like like a
[35:32] semilar or a cooler or some of these you
[35:34] know companies that are traditional
[35:36] operating kind of war zombie companies
[35:39] that have taken a Bitcoin treasury
[35:40] strategy but they're not um even though
[35:43] there's a good amount of conviction at
[35:44] maybe the CEO level they're not going
[35:47] like that full-blown all-in pivot like
[35:50] Micro Strategy is. So, I think there's
[35:53] there's risk factors there of there's
[35:56] still an operating business that's not a
[35:57] Bitcoin treasury company and there's
[36:00] still shareholders that are maybe not
[36:02] quite appreciating the Bitcoin treasury
[36:05] strategy, right? So, I think that's
[36:07] going to be an evolving space. But
[36:09] again, to me, from a from an insurance
[36:11] standpoint, um shareholder when
[36:15] shareholders don't understand the
[36:16] business or they don't like the way the
[36:18] stock price is going because they don't
[36:20] understand what the longer term vision
[36:24] is and maybe they're looking at it
[36:26] quartertoarter.
[36:28] That's just a ecosystem for shareholder
[36:30] litigation. So, um I completely applaud
[36:34] those companies that are taking a
[36:35] Bitcoin's treasury strategy. They are
[36:36] like historical operating business. I
[36:38] think that's um I think that's a good
[36:41] thing. So like over the long arc over
[36:43] the next few years what's you know DNO
[36:46] insurance ensure in ultimately ensures
[36:48] companies for a an alleged or actual
[36:51] breach of fiduciary duty right and if
[36:54] when you boil everything down the
[36:56] fiduciary duty of anybody at a public
[36:58] company is to increase shareholder value
[37:01] right so what's really we're in this
[37:03] interesting time where a company that is
[37:06] non Bitcoin treasury strategy could take
[37:08] on a Bitcoin treasury strategy And the
[37:11] FUD out there might be like, "Hey,
[37:12] you're not doing your fiduciary duty.
[37:14] Bitcoin is too risky." When those of us
[37:16] that have done the work and the homework
[37:18] on it actually realize that's better for
[37:20] the company. So I am a huge like I it is
[37:24] only a matter of time. It may be five
[37:27] years from now, maybe 10 years from now,
[37:29] but there will be a time in the future
[37:31] where the fiduciary duty of not owning
[37:34] Bitcoin on your balance sheet will
[37:36] create shareholder litigation because
[37:38] once the investor community understands
[37:41] the math, right? Not your opinion, not
[37:44] my opinion. Just look at the math.
[37:48] You You are not really doing your
[37:49] fiduciary duty if you don't find some
[37:51] way to incorporate Bitcoin into your
[37:54] treasury strategy in some form or
[37:55] fashion, right? I think we're a long way
[37:58] off from that. Like, but
[38:01] that that to me is inevitably going to
[38:02] happen. It'll just take time. And I
[38:04] think these Bitcoin treasury strategies
[38:06] are going to shine a really heavy light
[38:08] on demonstrating
[38:12] why, right?
[38:14] Yeah. So, um, on that, it seems like a a
[38:18] a big important piece of Sailor's role
[38:21] at Strategy, uh, even Dylan at
[38:24] MetaPlanet is being able to explain the
[38:28] why of what they're doing and why it
[38:31] creates shareholder value.
[38:33] um is and
[38:36] then when I go back to hearing perhaps
[38:39] more traditional earnings calls with
[38:42] CEOs where it's very dry and it seems
[38:46] like it was written by their attorneys
[38:49] and their communications director and
[38:53] maybe even their insurance broker uh
[38:55] that that do do you think that um there
[38:58] are risks with how much communication
[39:02] that Bitcoin and treasury companies are
[39:04] putting out there and and how to
[39:05] mitigate those uh so that they're they
[39:07] don't turn into litigation. What I think
[39:10] there's going to be short-term issues
[39:13] with long-term gain. So historically,
[39:16] yes, you're usually very scripted.
[39:20] If you run the risk, you know, usually
[39:23] the lawyers um are going to tell you as
[39:26] a board member like if you don't, you
[39:29] know, what you say will and can be used
[39:31] can and will be used against you, right?
[39:34] So they usually coach
[39:36] um board members, executives to be very
[39:39] scripted, keep everything within kind of
[39:42] the four corners of your SEC filings and
[39:45] just don't go off script, right?
[39:48] I don't think you could actually
[39:50] function well with what you take Sailor,
[39:54] right, who's kind of the trailblazer
[39:55] here. There's no way he would have been
[39:58] able to effectively communicate why he's
[40:01] doing what he's doing without like the
[40:04] constant drip of here's my conviction,
[40:09] here's why. Let me explain why we're
[40:13] doing what we're doing. Um, so I see a
[40:16] world where uh yeah, I think Dylan does
[40:18] a great job as well. um this when you
[40:22] take kind of the the Bitcoin ecosystem
[40:27] particularly you know led by really
[40:28] Micro Strategy early on I think
[40:31] MetaPlanet does a really good job as
[40:32] well and then all these treasury
[40:34] companies it's a totally different
[40:36] communication game that they're in which
[40:41] I don't honestly know how this will play
[40:43] out because I can see a very fair
[40:45] argument that there is so much
[40:48] communication that gets thrown out there
[40:50] on social media, these podcasts, etc.
[40:53] that you do, there's an argument you are
[40:56] setting yourself up for, well, you said
[40:59] this and therefore it didn't play out
[41:00] this way, so I'm going to sue you.
[41:04] I think my personal view on that is I I
[41:06] think that is going to be
[41:09] something that will happen over time,
[41:11] but I think that will fade over time
[41:13] because I think I mean as a shareholder
[41:16] um I I really really appreciate the
[41:20] communication um because I person I
[41:22] bought into strategy in 20 2020 22. Um,
[41:29] I love the amount of communication I get
[41:31] and the amount of communication I get
[41:32] like makes me a more stable shareholder
[41:35] because I really understand the why
[41:37] behind what they're doing. That being
[41:39] said, I'm not sure everybody does,
[41:41] right? So, um, my view is I do think
[41:45] that is the better way to go and we've
[41:47] seen this play out politically. like,
[41:48] you know, whatever your political
[41:50] leanings are, the right played the long
[41:53] form podcast angle way better than the
[41:56] left did. And I think
[41:59] there's a level of disclosure and
[42:02] authenticity that comes with these long
[42:04] form podcasts. I mean, I see it in
[42:06] insurance, too. So, like to give an
[42:07] example, like insurance is 99% on
[42:11] LinkedIn. Very, very few of them even
[42:13] touch X, right? And so you go into the
[42:16] Bitcoin land, it's almost inverse,
[42:18] right? Zero. People post from X onto
[42:21] LinkedIn because they feel they have to,
[42:24] but they don't really have any activity
[42:25] other than X. So I kind of sit in both
[42:28] of those worlds. And it's so um it's so
[42:31] eye opening to me how careful and
[42:34] calculated
[42:35] the LinkedIn posts are and how
[42:40] uh just kind of just speak your mind
[42:43] attitude there is on X right from a
[42:46] corporate governance standpoint like
[42:48] there's an argument to say that's that's
[42:50] a dangerous game to play but I think
[42:52] that actually is I'm a fan of that. Um,
[42:56] I think that is what more companies need
[42:59] to do over time,
[43:01] but if I'm being honest, that's that
[43:02] that's riddled with lawsuits, right?
[43:04] That that disclosure will come with
[43:06] lawsuit. So, that's part of where
[43:09] um my passion as a Bitcoiner in
[43:12] insurance kind of lies of like I think
[43:14] the amount of disclosure that they give
[43:17] um you know, like I can go on my Micro
[43:19] Strategy app on my phone and I think all
[43:21] their metrics, all of them are updated
[43:23] every 15 seconds. I love that. Right.
[43:26] And you look at their shareholder calls
[43:27] and I think they have a they had 150,000
[43:31] people on the live stream for their
[43:33] shareholder call. Like, show me a
[43:35] buttoned up traditional,
[43:38] you know,
[43:39] quarterly earnings call that has
[43:41] anywhere close to that kind of
[43:43] engagement, right? So I think I think
[43:45] we're just in this transitionary time
[43:47] where
[43:48] um whether it's social media like I
[43:52] think just the governance rules are
[43:53] slowly shifting and there's a bit of a
[43:57] generational divide. So I'm in my late
[43:59] 40s so I kind of I kind of feel like I
[44:01] always fall in between those two buckets
[44:03] of I have a lot of clients that are a
[44:05] lot younger than me and I have a lot of
[44:07] people in the insurance community that
[44:08] are signing off on managing these pools
[44:11] of risk that are older than me. Right?
[44:12] And there's just this will kind of come
[44:15] with time and iterations. But that's
[44:18] again I kind of sit in an interesting um
[44:21] chair from a a career standpoint, but I
[44:24] also sit at an interesting age where I
[44:26] kind of fit I kind of fall between uh
[44:29] I'm old but not too old quite yet. So
[44:32] yeah. Um they
[44:35] I'm reminded of the Financial Times.
[44:38] They ran a 20inut hit piece on uh micro
[44:41] strategy recently. Yes. Comparing the
[44:43] scarcity of Bitcoin to teeth. Um, a
[44:46] point that the journalist made that I
[44:48] thought was really interesting was that
[44:50] um, one of the arbitrageages here on the
[44:53] information landscape is that, uh,
[44:56] somebody who is representing a Bitcoin
[45:00] treasury company can speak pretty freely
[45:03] about Bitcoin as a commodity. Um, and
[45:06] they're not necessarily promoting their
[45:10] stock. they're promoting Bitcoin. Uh but
[45:13] then you know the inference is left to
[45:15] the viewer of oh well that company holds
[45:18] a lot of Bitcoin. So uh you know it's um
[45:23] that they would not be able to speak so
[45:26] glowingly of their the shares right of
[45:28] the the common stock uh without really
[45:31] tripping some wires over at the SEC.
[45:34] Yeah. It's just I think it's just an
[45:36] example of like there there's
[45:37] institution there there's like
[45:39] infrastructure that's been created over
[45:41] you know many many decades with case
[45:43] law. Uh and then you have these uh
[45:46] transformative businesses that frankly
[45:49] kind of like you know like they're all
[45:50] playing by a different game. They're
[45:53] totally within the bounds of the law but
[45:54] like they're thinking about their uh
[45:57] financial metrics in a totally different
[45:59] way. So like when somebody who's not
[46:02] kind of gotten themselves educated on on
[46:04] on Bitcoin and like and the why behind
[46:07] it, you you would sit in on any of these
[46:09] calls of these bitcoins and like Bitcoin
[46:12] yield and all the MNAV and all this
[46:14] stuff. Like they're just like that's the
[46:16] I don't even I don't even know where to
[46:17] start as far as like if that makes sense
[46:19] to them or not. Uh and you know like the
[46:23] as a Bitcoiner I'm like man I love those
[46:25] metrics because those actually those
[46:27] make a ton of sense to me. And so, yeah,
[46:29] it's just um
[46:32] that's not like on the good side. That's
[46:34] actually like an arbitrage to the good
[46:37] where I think Bitcoin treasury companies
[46:39] do have a little more freedom. Uh to
[46:42] your point, like you talk about Bitcoin,
[46:43] you don't talk about your company per
[46:44] se. Um but it does give you more
[46:47] communication avenues that
[46:50] uh yeah I mean we there's a reason
[46:52] Sailor doesn't talk about his stock
[46:54] because there is case law and that you
[46:57] know there are certain like bounds he
[46:58] just can't cross over uh without getting
[47:01] into you know more trouble than it's
[47:03] worth from a from a litigation
[47:04] standpoint. So I I look at that as like
[47:07] a kind of put it in the feature not a
[47:09] bug part of Bitcoin, right? Um it'll be
[47:12] interesting to see if you know if if
[47:14] these market structure bills genus act
[47:16] like if some of these things start to
[47:18] put a little bit more parameters around
[47:22] discussions around commodities versus
[47:24] stocks. Uh, I've not necessarily seen
[47:27] that, but who know who knows how that'll
[47:29] that'll play out. But I
[47:32] it's part of the space I really really
[47:34] like. It's just how freely they talk.
[47:37] I it it's fascinating. And even, you
[47:39] know, when I worked at Wright, you
[47:40] mentioned the the video we did about the
[47:42] carbon emissions. Um, it it was not like
[47:46] uh something that was advised to us by a
[47:49] communications or a public relations
[47:51] firm to to do that. uh it was very much
[47:54] uh improv of oh here's how we'll we'll
[47:57] hit back at the New York Times um and by
[48:00] going direct in that manner we ratioed
[48:03] the New York Times on X and so our
[48:05] messaging got out there that um if you
[48:09] think carbon emissions are a problem uh
[48:11] that problem is coming from the power
[48:13] plant it's not coming from the endusers
[48:15] of the electricity uh which is very
[48:19] important to establish you know where
[48:20] that liability lies
[48:22] Um, and that we got lots of great
[48:26] feedback from shareholders saying, "Hey,
[48:28] we're really happy that y'all are
[48:30] tackling this issue head on and not
[48:32] trying to hide from it or to um pour
[48:36] money into it that is uneconomical,
[48:38] right? That that would be wasteful to
[48:40] try to do some uh really inauthentic PR
[48:44] campaign against it or something." Yeah,
[48:46] I think it's it's it's really important.
[48:49] Um and I think it's where just the um
[48:51] the media landscape and the PR landscape
[48:54] is intersecting with kind of investor
[48:56] relations because yeah, you never would
[48:58] have done that in the past, right? And
[48:59] the fact that you can on a whim
[49:02] basically, grab your CO2 thing, record
[49:06] like a five minute video, post it on X
[49:09] and ratio the New York Times. We're in a
[49:11] different world as far as investor
[49:13] communication. Um I'll give a shout out
[49:16] to Jack Mers. I thought he did a
[49:19] fantastic job recently where they got
[49:23] into the lending space and somebody
[49:25] called him out rightly so on the
[49:28] rehypothecation language within the
[49:30] lending that went against a statement he
[49:33] had made. And in a normal world, you
[49:37] know, the insurance brokers, the
[49:38] lawyers, we'd all be freaking out like,
[49:40] "Jack, shut up. Okay, we're going to
[49:42] lock you down. You can't go on X. We're
[49:44] going to put this PR firm in place." and
[49:46] he just literally just gets on X and is
[49:50] just owns it and fixes it. And when I
[49:54] think of like a corporate governance
[49:57] um model of leadership, like that was
[50:01] phenomenal. Like as a DNO underwriter,
[50:03] former DNO, I'm like he just nipped a
[50:06] lot of liability in the in the bud right
[50:09] in my mind. Right. So I think there's
[50:13] there are dangers to communicating
[50:16] constantly,
[50:18] but when you I think what I really
[50:21] appreciate and love and gives me
[50:23] confidence in the Bitcoin space, not the
[50:25] crypto space to be frank, is the level
[50:29] of conviction at the Bitcoiner level.
[50:32] And again like Jack's just a good little
[50:34] illust so a sailor, right? um they
[50:37] the command that they have of their
[50:40] product and the why they don't have to
[50:44] go scripted. They literally speak from
[50:46] their heart. They speak off the top of
[50:49] their head. Like you know like Sailor's
[50:50] thing with Peterson that he just did was
[50:52] like same thing like very few CEOs or uh
[50:56] you know chairmans are going to do that
[50:58] because they're too afraid of saying
[51:00] something. But if you've done the proof
[51:01] of work, right, and you understand
[51:03] Bitcoin,
[51:05] you're you're kind of like, you know,
[51:07] that that you will the truth will kind
[51:10] of land on your side even if you're
[51:12] misunderstood. And that's I think I
[51:14] think that's the chapter we're in in
[51:16] kind of this corporate governance game.
[51:17] Like it's going to be messy. It it just
[51:20] is like as when the institutionals and
[51:22] retail uh investors don't understand
[51:25] Bitcoin, there's going to be lawsuits,
[51:27] right? So that's a lot lot of my day job
[51:30] is like as a Bitcoiner like I want
[51:32] nothing more than these BTC treasury
[51:34] strategies to succeed. But it's also I'm
[51:37] like I've been doing this for 25 years.
[51:39] I see all the bad stuff. Like let me
[51:40] help you just stay out of the woods and
[51:43] let me also like help you like figure
[51:46] out where Bitcoin mitigates like maybe
[51:49] you don't need to buy insurance on this
[51:50] thing because the Bitcoin um technology
[51:54] mitigates some of the threat vectors. So
[51:55] like I have a lot of those discussions
[51:56] of the intersection particularly in the
[51:58] custody world right now of uh the
[52:03] programmability of Bitcoin whether it's
[52:05] like miniscripts time locks um some of
[52:08] the stuff that Adam Beck is doing on on
[52:11] his side there are ways that kind of
[52:15] going back to your your auditing days
[52:17] like we would look at like compliance
[52:19] audit um you know what's your audit
[52:22] cadence like what does that all look
[52:24] Like there's a lot of things that
[52:26] cryptographically
[52:28] you can just do better that a custody
[52:31] crime underwriter at like a Lloyds or
[52:34] one of the big markets, they don't
[52:36] really they don't fully appreciate yet
[52:38] that you know because an underwriter is
[52:40] going to be like let me look at your
[52:41] audit procedures like um how how can an
[52:44] employee steal from the fund? How can an
[52:46] outside attacker come in and steal
[52:48] funds? there's you didn't have
[52:51] cryptographic,
[52:54] you know,
[52:56] ways to mitigate some of those things
[52:59] like you do now within the Bitcoin
[53:01] ecosystem. So that's just another like
[53:04] example of um I spend a good amount of
[53:06] time with companies of like I'm an
[53:08] insurance guy. I'm not a technologist,
[53:10] right? So I have to brush up on the
[53:13] technology level and lean on my clients
[53:16] in many ways of so so teach me how this
[53:19] works and then I put my underwriting
[53:22] hat on thinking okay that tech just
[53:25] solved one of these things I would
[53:26] normally um put down as like either a
[53:29] red flag I'm going to charge you more or
[53:31] a green flag I'm going to give you a
[53:33] credit because you did good you did bad
[53:35] right so we're at such early days in
[53:38] that space that the insurance industry I
[53:40] just has a um
[53:43] lot of opportunity to improve the
[53:46] overlay of the tech and the insurance
[53:47] product and capacity on top of it.
[53:50] That makes a lot of sense. Um and so for
[53:53] for for those uh going on this uh
[53:56] Bitcoin for corporations path uh what
[53:59] are some pieces of advice you would have
[54:01] for them uh you know as they go on their
[54:04] journey? Yeah, I think it's um you know
[54:07] just get good people wrapped around you.
[54:09] Like I think um
[54:12] you know like I I think the biggest
[54:14] fault you can have is
[54:17] my banker's my banker, my lawyer's my
[54:19] lawyer. They're old school, they're
[54:20] trfy, they don't get it. Bitcoin's
[54:21] totally different. There's truth to that
[54:24] statement, right? But find people within
[54:28] the legal community that actually
[54:29] understand Bitcoin and then lean on
[54:32] their kind of traditional. they have a
[54:35] lot of learnings to give you
[54:37] particularly as you're scaling and then
[54:40] work with them of okay here's the risk
[54:43] vectors here's where I think Bitcoin is
[54:45] different and like challenge each other
[54:47] and like have that vetting process of
[54:49] sharpening each other up do that with
[54:51] your auditing firms do that with your
[54:53] insurance broker um because there's a
[54:57] lot of
[54:59] when I'm sitting in the room with like
[55:01] Bitcoin companies um they'll say
[55:03] something I'm like, you know, there's an
[55:05] insurance product that can fix that. It
[55:07] may not be perfect, but if we tweak it a
[55:09] few ways, we can offload that risk at a
[55:11] fraction of the cost of what whatever
[55:13] they're wrestling with. Um, that they
[55:15] often don't know of. And sometimes I'll
[55:16] say, I think your exposure is here. And
[55:18] they're like, well, let me tell you why
[55:19] that doesn't exist because of the tech.
[55:22] Fair point. And so, if that's, you know,
[55:25] that partnership, um, I think is the
[55:28] real key thing to walk away with. get
[55:30] really good firms around you, firms that
[55:35] have a broad scale of uh because like
[55:37] you know I will literally I will talk to
[55:38] Bitcoin treasury companies on how do you
[55:40] vet your custodians and I'll talk to
[55:43] custodians how do you make a better
[55:45] product to attract more Bitcoin treasury
[55:47] companies or institutional capital right
[55:50] um so I get to see both sides of the
[55:53] table and a lot of my jobs is like okay
[55:57] if if you want to go from here to here
[55:59] insurance can get you this way. But if
[56:01] you need a lawyer, if you need an
[56:02] accountant, um most of us are
[56:04] fairlyworked. Uh and there are, you
[56:07] know, there's only a handful of
[56:09] insurance professionals that kind of get
[56:11] digital assets. There's a handful of
[56:12] lawyers. There's a handful of
[56:13] accountants. There's just not many of us
[56:15] yet. Um so that's another call like if
[56:18] you are in any of those spaces, I am big
[56:20] on the network. Um because I as an
[56:22] insurance person, I'm often asked, do
[56:24] you know a good lawyer that understands
[56:25] digital assets? Do you know a good
[56:26] accounting firm? like it's not just you
[56:28] know yeah deote but who at Deote or who
[56:31] at KPMG right um those types of things
[56:33] so there's a lot of value that your
[56:36] service provider in that kind of
[56:39] professional services space can add to
[56:42] you beyond just
[56:44] please get my insurance done please get
[56:46] my taxes done etc etc so
[56:50] that makes a lot of sense um and then uh
[56:53] la last question before we wrap up is um
[56:56] a lot of these treasury companies seem
[56:58] to be going international or are
[57:00] international. Um what what are some of
[57:03] like the unique challenges there with
[57:04] with insurance and DNO in particular?
[57:07] Yeah, if we go back to DNO um you know
[57:10] it's jurisdiction by jurisdiction. So
[57:13] some uh most policies if you write get a
[57:16] DNO policy they're usually um for an
[57:18] Americanbased company the coverage will
[57:21] be worldwide. Uh so you don't have an
[57:23] issue of like it covers every country
[57:25] outside of like OFAC sanctioned
[57:27] countries. Um but there's all these when
[57:31] you get in country by country certain
[57:34] countries will allow a US-based or a
[57:37] Lloydsbased policy to be called
[57:39] admitted. Uh other countries will say we
[57:42] don't accept that policy. So you have to
[57:44] have in addition to your global policy,
[57:46] we're going to have you buy a local
[57:48] admitted policy from a local insurer in
[57:52] Venezuela or you you name it. So when
[57:55] companies go global, you can't just rely
[57:57] on your global just because you have a
[58:01] global DNO policy does not mean it's
[58:02] going to be accepted in XYZ countries.
[58:06] So it's a complete hodgepodge of uh
[58:09] regulatory frameworks. That's where like
[58:11] having a global broker such as Marsh
[58:13] where I work is is important because we
[58:15] have offices in 130 countries. Um so we
[58:18] have people inhouse on the ground that
[58:22] one they speak the local language they
[58:24] know the local um authorities the you
[58:27] know the legal system etc. Um because if
[58:30] you don't do it what you can run into is
[58:33] you could have a director an incountry
[58:35] director that gets sued.
[58:39] you want to pay them but the country
[58:41] like you want to indemnify them for
[58:43] their legal fees but you're not allowed
[58:46] to by the country because you didn't buy
[58:47] a local policy or you're allowed to and
[58:50] then you get hit with a bunch of fines.
[58:52] So there's it's a compliance and it's a
[58:54] governance. Uh and as soon as you go
[58:56] outside the US, it is just a complete um
[59:01] matrix of
[59:03] do I not do I need to and so that's
[59:06] really what where you want to lean on
[59:07] your insurance broker uh from that
[59:08] standpoint. It seems to go
[59:10] international.
[59:12] Well, this has been a really fascinating
[59:14] conversation, Garrett. Uh thank you so
[59:16] much for coming on. I think that uh
[59:18] hopefully we address a lot of the
[59:19] questions of of either companies that
[59:22] are looking to acquire Bitcoin or
[59:24] already have and are are uh grappling
[59:26] with all these different uh big
[59:28] questions in the space.
[59:30] So, thank thank you for coming on and uh
[59:33] we we hope to have you back on soon.
[59:35] Sounds good. Thanks beer.
