[00:00] We are still rolling with more Bitcoin
[00:02] mining content. Mastering treasury
[00:04] management. I'm joined by three
[00:07] gentlemen I actually just saw the other
[00:08] week. If you guys want to take a seat,
[00:10] Jeff Lucas of Bit Farms is Oh, look at
[00:12] that. We matched up the pictures
[00:13] perfectly. On my right, Drew Armstrong
[00:16] of Cathedral and Salicon of Mara. Uh
[00:19] this topic has been on the minds of most
[00:22] people in Bitcoin mining over the last
[00:25] 12 months especially with Micro Strategy
[00:28] MSTR uh ripping in the markets. A lot of
[00:31] Bitcoin miners have been way more
[00:33] interested in figuring out treasury
[00:35] management strategies to increase their
[00:38] Bitcoin per share and more than that
[00:40] also to survive as Bitcoin miners. It's
[00:43] a hard industry. I think these three
[00:45] guys can tell you a little bit about
[00:46] that. And if you're going to survive in
[00:47] Bitcoin mining, you need a solid
[00:50] treasury playbook. So, we're going to
[00:52] dig into it quickly. We'll do some
[00:54] introductions uh and then we'll roll
[00:56] into some topics. Off to you first, sir.
[01:01] Well, Mara is a well-known house
[01:03] household name in this conference at
[01:05] least. We're the largest Bitcoin miner
[01:07] in the world with 57 xahash in under our
[01:11] capacity. We operate in uh four
[01:14] continents with 16 data centers and our
[01:17] story has evolved over a period of time.
[01:19] Uh we were not the largest and we have
[01:22] grown over this period of time uh and
[01:24] deployed capital responsibly. We we have
[01:26] the lowest cost of electricity per coin
[01:29] when it when we come and when we look at
[01:31] this sector and uh and we're very
[01:33] excited about our mining business. So we
[01:35] happen to know Bitcoin a little bit if
[01:38] you like and we produce about 700 to 900
[01:42] Bitcoin a month and we hold all that
[01:45] Bitcoin on our balance sheet. The reason
[01:48] is we love Bitcoin. Uh Bitcoin as an
[01:50] asset class has been out of the last 15
[01:53] years 11 years it has been the best rate
[01:56] of return asset class. It has beaten
[01:59] other traditional asset classes like S&P
[02:02] 500, you name it, REITs, um you know,
[02:06] look at other commodities, oil, natural
[02:08] gas, and and you know, it continues to
[02:10] produce great rate of return and it is
[02:13] at the all-time high last couple of
[02:15] days. So, we're very excited about that.
[02:17] Having said that, we are also the second
[02:19] largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide.
[02:22] 50,000 coins approximately on our
[02:24] balance sheet. It didn't happen in a
[02:26] vacuum. We produce Bitcoin and hold it
[02:29] while we also go out and
[02:30] opportunistically buy Bitcoin from the
[02:33] open market. We don't have to do that
[02:35] like other treasury companies, but we do
[02:38] that as the as the opportunity arises
[02:40] and that has produced great rate of
[02:42] returns for us and we're super excited
[02:44] about that. Drew, over to you. Yeah. Uh,
[02:48] so I'm the president and COO of
[02:49] Cathedral Bitcoin. We're a publicly
[02:51] traded company on the TSXV. uh and I I
[02:55] think we have we share the same bullish
[02:57] outlook on Bitcoin uh as MEA but we go
[03:00] about uh that view in a different way.
[03:03] We develop infrastructure uh with the
[03:05] goal of increasing our Bitcoin holdings
[03:07] on a per share basis. So I think from
[03:09] from our point of view we focus on
[03:11] developing rack space because we really
[03:13] think that power and rack space is the
[03:15] scarce commodity and is the biggest
[03:16] bottleneck to uh call it scaling compute
[03:20] of various forms. And then we seek to
[03:24] hold our retained earnings in Bitcoin
[03:26] because, you know, as Salman said,
[03:27] Bitcoin has done very well, but also
[03:29] we're of the view that Bitcoin will
[03:31] continue to emerge as a a global reserve
[03:33] currency. Uh, and we think that this is
[03:36] really still the early innings of
[03:37] Bitcoin's uh adoption globally. Um, but
[03:41] yes, our view is basically long
[03:42] Rackspace, long Bitcoin. Jeff, sure. and
[03:46] Bit Farms. Bit Farms has been mining
[03:48] Bitcoin, one of the most long-standing
[03:50] miners here since 2017. We've got about
[03:52] 20 Xahash, about 500 megawatts currently
[03:55] under management with a pipeline for a
[03:56] gig and a half here. We've actually made
[03:58] a bit of a pivot recently here. We've
[04:01] recognized that our thesis here is how
[04:03] do we manage our megawatts to maximize
[04:05] our valuation? And so, we've actually
[04:07] shifted or supplemented our activities
[04:08] now by going more into HBC and AI. And
[04:11] the thesis is pretty straightforward
[04:13] here. When you look at valuations, the
[04:15] Bitcoin miners, you see multiples of
[04:17] anywhere from maybe two to five times.
[04:20] You look at HBC and AI, it's north of
[04:22] 20. So for us, we're realizing a lot
[04:24] more value here by pivoting, being more
[04:26] active and focusing on what's happening
[04:28] on the HPC side. All that being said, we
[04:31] are very active, however, in our Bitcoin
[04:33] management and our hollow management
[04:34] here. Well, we use a principle called
[04:36] capital efficiency. So rather than just
[04:38] building up the Bitcoin here, we utilize
[04:41] that Bitcoin to fund our growth far more
[04:43] cheaply than equity and doing the ATM
[04:45] here, but also engage in some
[04:47] derivatives activity here to get that
[04:49] same performance, but we do that
[04:50] synthetically
[04:52] and it works great for us.
[04:55] And I'll introduce myself really
[04:56] quickly. I'm Will Fox, co-host of the
[04:57] Mining Pod. I have very little if any
[04:59] Bitcoin compared to these guys. Uh but I
[05:02] do get the pleasure of interviewing them
[05:04] every once in a while. Salomon, I'm
[05:05] going to throw it back to you. Uh Mara
[05:07] made headlines a few weeks ago when you
[05:09] guys started putting the gas onto the
[05:12] fire of a Bitcoin uh strategy, the
[05:14] accumulation strategy. You guys
[05:15] announced a very large ATM and the
[05:17] intent and purchase to continue to
[05:19] purchase more and more Bitcoin. Lining
[05:22] up with our topic here, mastering
[05:23] treasury management. How do you guys see
[05:25] actively uh selling shares and
[05:28] purchasing Bitcoin uh acrewing value to
[05:31] MARA? That's a great question. And so
[05:34] when I I want to step back a little bit
[05:36] from a strategic perspective, when you
[05:38] think about us, we are primarily an
[05:41] energy technology company that is
[05:43] focused on Bitcoin mining and we are
[05:46] good at it. We do it very well
[05:48] worldwide. We accumulate Bitcoin by
[05:50] doing that. I call this a twin
[05:52] turbocharge strategy. by twin turbo. If
[05:56] you drive a car, you know, when you
[05:58] drive a twin turbo car, it's very
[06:00] difficult to go back to a car that does
[06:03] not have twin turbo engine. It's slower.
[06:06] It's not as active as you would see a
[06:09] twin turbocharged engine. Mara is not
[06:11] for everybody. If you like driving fast
[06:13] cars, you want to accumulate Bitcoin
[06:16] really quickly by mining at one/ird of
[06:19] the cost of the price of Bitcoin in the
[06:22] open market
[06:23] while also going out and acquiring
[06:25] Bitcoin from the open market as the as
[06:28] the as the opportunity arises.
[06:31] That is the piece where you would want
[06:33] to hold hold Mara stock because we are
[06:35] going twin turbo charge strategy by
[06:38] tackling both mining operations
[06:41] accumulating bitcoin through that but
[06:43] also acquiring bitcoin in the open
[06:44] market. Now to go back to your question,
[06:48] look, we have multiple sources of
[06:49] capital, not just the ATM, but ATM is
[06:52] has been the source of primary source of
[06:55] capital in this sector primarily because
[06:57] this sector was debanked over these
[06:59] years. As you know, SEC did not like
[07:02] this sector previously. Uh the the
[07:05] regulations were not favorable to this
[07:07] sector. So generally speaking, banks
[07:10] stayed away and traditional investors
[07:12] stayed away from this sector. So
[07:13] primarily this main source of capital
[07:16] for this sector was ATM and it still
[07:18] continues to be a major source of
[07:21] capital. Now having said that 40% of our
[07:24] source of capital last year was ATM the
[07:26] rest was other sources and we like to
[07:29] mix and match. We like to see what is
[07:31] the best source of our capital. It's a
[07:33] capital allocation question. How can we
[07:35] go out and invest and get the best rate
[07:39] of returns for our investors?
[07:42] the money that our investors have given
[07:44] to us as fiduciaries. How can we
[07:46] maximize that rate of return? Is that
[07:48] through the Bitcoin mining side based on
[07:51] the the future curve that we think is
[07:54] going to be the Bitcoin price and the
[07:56] hash price with the global hash rate or
[07:59] does it make sense because there's a lot
[08:01] of tailwind uh with the with the
[08:03] political push with the strategic
[08:05] Bitcoin reserve with the Blackrock and
[08:08] Fidelity and others and the ETF launches
[08:11] and the sovereign world the the
[08:13] sovereigns coming out and talking about
[08:15] holding Bitcoin as strategic reserve.
[08:17] curve or maybe the sovereigns thinking
[08:20] about they don't know much about Bitcoin
[08:21] but they want to use mining as an energy
[08:25] arbitrage they have excess power and
[08:28] they want to put that power to use so
[08:30] multiple sources when you combine that
[08:33] together and you look at our cost of
[08:34] capital what is the best way of
[08:37] utilizing our capital and deploy that
[08:40] and create the most rate of return for
[08:42] our stockholders so for example we did
[08:44] 0% coupon $2 billion last year and we
[08:49] went out and primarily bought Bitcoin
[08:52] while we were also producing Bitcoin or
[08:54] holding on our balance sheet. So, it's a
[08:56] combination of different sources of
[08:58] capital. It's a capital allocation
[09:00] question. It's a timing of the market.
[09:02] It's dependent dependent on the
[09:04] macroeconomic conditions and all of that
[09:06] comes into play when we think about how
[09:08] do we go about and source Bitcoin for
[09:10] our shareholders. Yeah, I love this
[09:13] topic here because the treasury
[09:15] management part of Bitcoin mining is
[09:16] almost more important than anything
[09:18] else. The ability to survive across
[09:20] cycles and on stage we have so many
[09:22] different ways of doing it. So you kind
[09:23] of talked about the financial side of
[09:24] things. You know Maro being such a large
[09:26] market cap has access to different
[09:28] sources of financing than others and
[09:30] then down the line you guys already
[09:31] mentioned some some things. So Drew uh
[09:33] long rack space let's get into that next
[09:35] and then Jeff finish off with AIHPC.
[09:38] Sure, you guys are long rack space and
[09:40] you guys uh build purpose fit
[09:43] constructions for Bitcoin mining and
[09:44] sell those on the open market for others
[09:46] and then you also obviously have your
[09:48] own self mining operations. So tell me
[09:50] about that way of accumulating Bitcoin.
[09:53] Yeah, so we were on a similar panel uh I
[09:56] guess three of the four of us were on a
[09:57] similar panel a couple weeks ago at
[09:58] Consensus and I told Salman then that I
[10:00] was going to steal his twin turbo
[10:02] strategy analogy. I think for us the
[10:04] twin turbos are again developing this
[10:07] these data centers. these fit for
[10:08] purpose data centers. Um, and then
[10:10] obviously also accumulating Bitcoin. And
[10:12] the reason why we like to develop this
[10:14] rack space and lease it out as opposed
[10:16] to buying AS6 is because we think AS6
[10:19] are a trade to put on but not a good way
[10:22] to predictably compound capital. And so
[10:24] for us, we think that developing these
[10:26] data centers and leasing them out has a
[10:28] better risk adjusted return uh versus
[10:30] buying A6. And you know, I think that's
[10:32] for a few reasons, but also we think
[10:34] there's a strategic benefit to to own
[10:37] the rights to power as well because you
[10:39] then also have a call option on future
[10:41] types of compute like AIHBC uh that that
[10:44] might be able to monetize that power in
[10:46] a different way. So we we uh develop
[10:49] these data centers, lease them out.
[10:51] Historically, our uh capex per megawatt
[10:54] has been around 170,000 per megawatt.
[10:57] And uh you know, even if you add some
[10:59] sort of CYA adjustment to that, we're
[11:01] still uh you you can conceivably earn a
[11:04] 50 to 100% cash flow yield, which means
[11:06] uh you know, up to a one-year payback,
[11:08] uh perhaps a little longer, but we think
[11:10] that that's a really good risk adjusted
[11:12] return. And then to maximize our sort of
[11:14] upside exposure and to express our
[11:16] belief in Bitcoin, we'll save those
[11:17] retained earnings in Bitcoin. And uh I
[11:21] will say in in September of last year,
[11:22] we put out a Bitcoin treasury strategy
[11:25] memo. Uh this was at the time the the
[11:27] Bitcoin Treasury play was a little less
[11:29] in vogue than it is now. I feel like
[11:31] we've seen about half a dozen in the
[11:33] last month or two. Uh but you know at
[11:34] the time we we sort of expressed that
[11:36] that was what we're going to try to do
[11:37] as well but not always through dilution.
[11:40] Since then we've not taken on any
[11:41] dilution but uh we we have increased our
[11:44] sats per share uh by around 16 to 17%
[11:47] and on an annualized basis that's around
[11:49] a 26% u sats per share yield or bitcoin
[11:53] yield is what some of the other treasury
[11:54] strategies are calling. So for us again
[11:56] we think that developing this rack space
[11:58] and then accumulating Bitcoin uh through
[12:00] our retained earnings is a great way to
[12:03] uh one have better riskadjusted returns
[12:05] on sort of a project investment basis
[12:07] but then also increasing our Bitcoin
[12:09] holdings because you know on a long
[12:10] enough time horizon we are incredibly
[12:12] bullish on Bitcoin. It may go down in
[12:14] the short term, but we think that we're
[12:16] really looking at, you know, uh a uh
[12:18] innovation in a world changing asset.
[12:21] And I think we're really witnessing one
[12:22] of the great wealth transfers in human
[12:24] history for those who have the the
[12:26] foresight to start accumulating Bitcoin.
[12:27] Now, uh you know, I think in the future
[12:29] we might opportunistically raise capital
[12:31] at the right terms so that we can uh uh
[12:34] put some accelerants on that and
[12:35] accumulate Bitcoin even more, but we
[12:38] might also use that capital to develop
[12:40] new data centers. And I think having
[12:41] those two levers for growth makes it
[12:43] easiest for us to always be
[12:44] opportunistic and never forced into
[12:46] growing in just one direction because I
[12:48] think it is something we saw uh you know
[12:50] in the last five years a lot of folks
[12:52] were so focused on hash rate growth for
[12:53] its own sake. Uh you know and I'm not
[12:55] saying the gentleman on on this panel
[12:57] were were among them but I think many
[12:59] miners were stuck on an ASICH hamster
[13:01] wheel where the only way to grow was to
[13:03] buy new AS6 even if at the time it
[13:05] wasn't a great investment. So that's
[13:06] really the main thing we're trying to
[13:08] avoid with our twin tur turbo strategy
[13:10] of long rack space long bitcoin. So our
[13:13] our decision actually to go into HBCI
[13:15] was driven by something very similar
[13:17] principles to what Drew spoke to and
[13:19] what they call in the banking world ray
[13:20] rock which is indeed riskadjusted return
[13:23] on invested capital. For us that ray
[13:25] rock is far superior in HBC and it is in
[13:28] Bitcoin mining. First of all, as we all
[13:30] know, the technology curve for
[13:32] increasingly new miners that are more
[13:34] efficient here, it's very, very
[13:35] expensive. And the question is, does it
[13:36] a company ever return or achieve a
[13:39] return on that continuing investment?
[13:41] We're focused right now with HBCI on the
[13:44] Empy
[13:46] lot of what the miners are doing because
[13:48] how many of them actually have
[13:49] consistent earnings going forward? We
[13:51] find that there's a fundamental demand
[13:53] in HBCAI that's going to drive to
[13:55] actually a more consistent earning
[13:57] stream going forward here and a better
[13:58] use of capital. So for us it's really
[14:01] twofold of getting involved with HBC.
[14:03] One, you've got this very profound
[14:04] demand here. Look at studies have shown
[14:07] that the expectation is by 2030 $5
[14:11] trillion will be invested in HPCAI and
[14:14] that the power requirements will go to
[14:16] about 156 gawatt. Now with that thought
[14:19] in mind bear keep in mind here that
[14:21] mining right now uses under 20 gawatt.
[14:24] So the potential there is immense but
[14:26] very importantly here with that ray rock
[14:28] here with the earning stability and the
[14:30] profound demand of HPCAI we can finance
[14:33] that with debt. We've always been very
[14:35] focused on minimizing our dilution not
[14:38] tapping aggressively into our ATM. In
[14:40] Bitcoin mining you need to use equity.
[14:42] The volatility the variability really
[14:45] mandates actually doing equity
[14:46] financing. The beauty of HBCAI is that
[14:49] we can use debt financing. So for our
[14:51] financing of our HBC data centers here,
[14:54] we're using debt. We're paying maybe 8
[14:56] to 10% as the cost of capital here. And
[14:58] on top of that, as I mentioned before,
[15:00] you get maybe a 4x valuation in the 20s
[15:03] versus the 3 to five that's actually in
[15:06] place here, you know, within Bitcoin
[15:07] miners. Now, we actually value our H our
[15:10] Bitcoin very much as well. And we use
[15:12] this premise of the capital efficiency.
[15:15] We rely very heavily on the derivatives
[15:17] markets and we've used them very very
[15:18] effectively here to get returns at
[15:21] parallel actually holding the Bitcoin
[15:22] without having to put our precious
[15:24] capital into the Bitcoin holdings going
[15:26] forward. It's worked out very very well
[15:28] for us. It allows us to employ leverage.
[15:30] It allows us to employ what's called
[15:32] convexity in terms of our options and
[15:34] futures trading here. It brings a very
[15:36] attractive return overall.
[15:38] Okay, we got about eight minutes left
[15:40] here and there's tons of questions to go
[15:42] to. So, we're going to do a snake draft
[15:43] and go back this way. So, Jeff, I'm
[15:46] going to throw it back to you. When we
[15:48] talk about the convertible bond market,
[15:49] that's been a very interesting source of
[15:52] allocation over the last 6 months. Kind
[15:54] of slowed down a little bit. Uh people
[15:55] have been looking more to ATMs or even
[15:58] debt structures. We've seen a lot of
[15:59] debt with Coinbase recently where you're
[16:01] putting your Bitcoin up and then you're
[16:02] able to pull uh some sort of debt
[16:04] function out of it. How are you looking
[16:05] at that market? Um when it pertains to
[16:08] Bit Farms, when is it the right time to
[16:10] call that sort of capital? uh and and
[16:12] why would you do so in an AI HPC setting
[16:15] right now versus when you were
[16:17] historically looking at Bitcoin mining?
[16:20] So first of all for us it's far more
[16:22] attractive actually to do straight debt
[16:24] than it is to do convertibles here. You
[16:26] have that equity element. It's much more
[16:27] expensive there. So for us it just makes
[16:29] a lot of sense here. But it's also very
[16:31] important to understand. I think if
[16:33] you're one of the largest players like
[16:34] Mara you can get pretty opportune
[16:36] pricing with your convertible notes and
[16:37] convertible debentures. However, when
[16:39] you're a midsize minor and you really
[16:41] need to understand what is the all-in
[16:43] cost of convertible debt. By way of
[16:45] example here, you may have to actually
[16:47] uh engage in a what they call synthetic
[16:49] borrow that can be expensive. They have
[16:51] to have put in place a buyback provision
[16:53] which can cost several hundred million
[16:55] dollars. You have a provision called a
[16:57] cap call which allows you to convert at
[16:59] a higher level than a state. All those
[17:01] things take away from however much you
[17:03] borrow. You still got to repay that
[17:04] principle down the road here. So when
[17:06] you factor in all the cost of doing
[17:09] venture, you realize that actual cost of
[17:11] capital is much higher than would be
[17:13] seen at face value for us. We feel we
[17:15] can get a much better return and a much
[17:17] lower cost of capital by really engaging
[17:19] straight debt. Love it. Okay, Drew, over
[17:22] to you. Uh I want to just continue
[17:24] hitting on that rack space idea. Like
[17:27] when you come to the point of like being
[17:29] a smaller minor, you know, you guys
[17:30] don't have as much hash rate. How do you
[17:32] value that Bitcoin huddle? And I'm a
[17:35] Bitcoin bull. I think it's going to a
[17:36] million. Is it just about increasing the
[17:39] Bitcoin on the balance sheet per
[17:40] employee or some other metric or are you
[17:43] guys trying to race and use this rack
[17:45] space model to get to where some of your
[17:47] peers are 10 15 20 50 xahash? Yeah. So I
[17:52] think for us uh again it comes down to
[17:54] just sort of being opportunistic but our
[17:56] goal on a long time on on the long term
[17:58] is to increase our sats per share. Uh
[18:00] and so you know that might mean that
[18:02] Bitcoin balance goes down uh for a
[18:04] period of time if we think there's a
[18:05] really attractive opportunity to grow uh
[18:07] you know grow our rack space grow our
[18:09] power footprint. Uh but again you know
[18:11] we think in the long term Bitcoin is
[18:13] going to be one of the best performing
[18:14] assets of human history as it's already
[18:15] been uh over the last uh 16 years here.
[18:18] So you know I think for us it really
[18:20] comes down to being opportunistic. Uh
[18:22] and because we're a smaller minor you
[18:24] know I think as of uh today before we
[18:26] got on here our market cap is something
[18:28] to the tune of $48 million. uh you know
[18:30] we're we're we're much smaller than the
[18:31] two gentlemen I'm with on stage. As a
[18:33] result, I think we really just think
[18:34] about things in a return on invested
[18:36] capital point of view and it forces us
[18:38] to be really disciplined about thinking
[18:39] how we grow and how we deploy capital
[18:41] and focuses us to be uh forces us to be
[18:43] quite lean which I think is important.
[18:45] So you know we consider also
[18:46] non-dilutive ways of growing using
[18:48] things like Bitcoin backed debt. I think
[18:50] Bitcoin backed debt you know many things
[18:51] Jeff said is spoton. I think in
[18:53] particular, you know, Bitcoin backed
[18:55] debt is really the most mispriced risk
[18:57] in the world. But one thing that many
[18:58] many folks are going to need to remember
[19:00] is that rehypotheation and the low
[19:02] coupon that comes with it also
[19:04] introduces its own risk. Uh but you
[19:06] know, I think to to the exact question,
[19:08] I think with uh the long rack space,
[19:10] long Bitcoin thesis really comes down to
[19:12] being opportunistic and going where the
[19:14] best opportunity is, which is nice
[19:16] because then we don't only have one way
[19:18] to grow. Uh which is something I think
[19:20] has plagued miners in the past. And it's
[19:22] not just about accumulating Bitcoin. So
[19:24] Salman, I want to throw this question to
[19:25] you as we're we're getting close to
[19:27] time. We have a few minutes left. It's
[19:29] not just about accumulating, but using
[19:30] that Bitcoin. So you guys have a
[19:32] headline as of last week where you're
[19:34] putting some Bitcoin out with two prime
[19:36] to get some yield on top of it. Tell us
[19:37] a little bit about that debt structure
[19:39] or at least that structure that you guys
[19:41] are putting that yield out. Someone's
[19:43] using that Bitcoin in a productive basis
[19:44] and you guys get to benefit from it. Uh
[19:48] why do you do it? Who are you using for
[19:50] these sort of services? and what's the
[19:52] long-term benefit for Mara and Mara
[19:54] shareholders.
[19:56] So before I answer that, I want to step
[19:57] back a little bit and
[20:00] ask the audience here by raise of hands,
[20:02] how much how many of you like Bitcoin?
[20:06] There you go. Vast majority of us,
[20:08] right? Would you want to huddle Bitcoin
[20:10] or not?
[20:12] Okay, that's great. So the reason I
[20:15] asked this question is you have to first
[20:18] define why are we hodling, right? Why
[20:21] are we keeping this on our balance
[20:22] sheet? Because this is a once-
[20:25] ina-lifetime unique opportunity to
[20:27] invest in an asset class that in my
[20:30] lifetime I've never seen before. And I
[20:32] come from traditional as traditional
[20:34] finance background as it can be. Oil and
[20:37] gas, renewable energy technology
[20:39] background and advisory in the past.
[20:41] Right? When you think about Bitcoin as a
[20:44] category, you want to hold that and see
[20:48] the appreciation of value on the balance
[20:50] sheet. But while you're doing that,
[20:52] there's opportunity to place that
[20:54] Bitcoin and earn a yield on it. Or just
[20:57] think about it, not a great example, but
[20:59] a fiat example. If you have cash sitting
[21:02] on your bank account, you don't want
[21:04] that cash to be sitting idle and not
[21:07] creating value for you. you want to
[21:09] place that in treasuries or other places
[21:12] where you can earn some yield on it,
[21:14] right? So the same concept although not
[21:17] a great example, we all don't like fiat,
[21:19] we like Bitcoin. You take that to
[21:22] Bitcoin as an example, you want to
[21:25] create some kind of a rate of return
[21:27] while you're waiting for the Bitcoin
[21:29] price to go up. When we made the
[21:31] decision last year to hold all all our
[21:33] Bitcoin on the balance sheet, Bitcoin
[21:35] was priced at $45,000 per coin. Today,
[21:38] it's touching $110, $111,000 per coin.
[21:42] Think about the thesis of the rate of
[21:44] return for our investors. So we like the
[21:46] capital appreciation but then while
[21:48] we're doing that we want to place
[21:51] responsibly because this is our
[21:54] hardearned money that we want to place
[21:58] with people that we trust
[22:01] that when we need that bitcoin back
[22:03] those people will be available to return
[22:05] that bitcoin back and twime is one of
[22:08] them that we announced fairly recently.
[22:10] We've worked with true prime before and
[22:12] we've worked with almost everyone in
[22:14] this industry but um we take the bitcoin
[22:18] and place them in uh in in treasury
[22:21] management if you like and this topic by
[22:24] itself can take half an hour to discuss
[22:25] I know we have just a minute left but
[22:28] the the concept is that we expect to
[22:30] create a rate of return let's say mid
[22:33] mid to high singledigit rate of return
[22:37] on an asset which is already giving us
[22:40] 150% rate of return on a capital
[22:42] appreciation basis on a year-to-year
[22:44] basis. So, what that does is it helps us
[22:47] pay for our expenses. It sweetens the
[22:50] deal for us for holding the Bitcoin for
[22:53] a longer duration of time on the balance
[22:55] sheet and continue to see the
[22:57] appreciation from a long-term
[22:58] perspective. So, we're excited about
[23:00] that, but yet as a public company, we
[23:03] are careful around whom do we place that
[23:06] bitcoin with and what is the risk that
[23:08] we take in in placing that bet. So,
[23:11] that's that's a summary of it. That's
[23:13] perfect. And that is time. Put your
[23:15] hands together for these three
[23:16] gentlemen. Jeff, Drew, Salman, thank you
[23:18] so much for joining. That was mastering
[23:20] treasury management. How to accumulate
[23:22] as much Bitcoin as possible. We're going
[23:25] to jump off stage, but don't go anywhere
[23:27] because we have an amazing panel up
[23:29] next. Something uh about heat reuse.
[23:32] It's kind of a big topic of Bitcoin
[23:34] mining these days, right, Drew? So,
[23:36] don't go anywhere.
