[00:00] many Bitcoiners that have come up to you
[00:01] and asked for these pictures. Have any
[00:03] of them tried or persuaded you to have
[00:05] like a change of heart?
 Oh, almost all
[00:07] of them. Everybody kind of wants me on
[00:09] the team, right? It's like I'm like the
[00:11] star player that like if we can get
[00:13] Peter, if we can convince Peter, like I
[00:15] represent like the last hold out of the
[00:18] old guard because then if they turn me,
[00:20] then it's opening up a floodgate.
[00:25] We're here with the notorious Peter
[00:28] Schiff at the Bitcoin conference. Not a
[00:31] gold conference. A Bitcoin conference.
[00:34] How does it feel to be here?
 Well, if it
[00:36] was a gold conference, it would be much
[00:38] smaller. You'd probably fit the whole
[00:40] conference in this back room here. Just
[00:42] your uh you know, your whale tank,
[00:44] whatever it is, is bigger than most gold
[00:46] conferences.
 That's funny. I saw the
[00:48] tweet that you made the first day of u
[00:52] industry day when you set up your booth
[00:54] and you're like I was here in 2006. This
[00:57] reminds me of back in the day before
[00:59] everything crashed.
 Well, it was the
[01:01] mortgage bankers. But, you know, one of
[01:03] the things that, you know, I looked at
[01:05] at the time was how fancy their booths
[01:07] were and they had a lot of
[01:09] entertainment. I think they even had
[01:10] like tigers there. But the industry had
[01:13] so much money in mortgage finance
[01:15] because of the big bubble. And right now
[01:18] it's the crypto industry that has all
[01:20] the money because of this massive
[01:22] bubble. They had so much money they
[01:23] bought off all the politicians. So
[01:25] that's why you have the Trumps here. You
[01:27] have JD Vance here because crypto was
[01:30] the biggest donor to you know the Trump
[01:33] campaign. They gave more than the
[01:35] defense industry than the pharmaceutical
[01:38] industry, the oil and gas industry.
[01:41] crypto was the biggest, you know,
[01:42] influence buyer and, you know, you have
[01:45] a conference like this, they don't
[01:48] normally occur at market bottoms. You
[01:51] know, when you have this kind of money
[01:53] that's been made, this kind of
[01:54] enthusiasm and excitement, it's more
[01:56] indicative that something's coming to an
[01:58] end because people are always very
[02:01] optimistic and very bullish at the peak.
[02:04] And when you get that kind of attitude,
[02:08] you need to really question uh what
[02:10] comes next. That that's what I mentioned
[02:12] when I did the panel debate I did
[02:14] yesterday was for people to try to
[02:16] assess whether or not they think they're
[02:19] early or late based on, you know, how
[02:21] big this is. And people can look, oh, it
[02:25] just means it's going to get bigger.
[02:26] Well, maybe not. Maybe this is, you
[02:28] know, maximum uh size right now. Because
[02:33] when you're talking about Bitcoin,
[02:35] you're talking about basically the
[02:37] greater fool. You
 okay?
 Because Bitcoin
[02:40] depends on more people coming into the
[02:44] ecosystem and buying because that's how
[02:46] the people that are already in can get
[02:48] out. You have more people to buy what
[02:51] they're selling. And I know a lot of
[02:53] people just don't sell any Bitcoin. Um
[02:56] and that helps keep the price going.
[02:58] But, you know, people do sell and you
[03:01] need new buyers and just the people that
[03:04] are already in, you know, may not be
[03:06] enough because they've already bought
[03:08] it. But eventually there's always a
[03:10] group that gets left holding the bag
[03:12] because it's a it's not a wealth
[03:15] creating system. It's just a wealth
[03:17] transfer mechanism. Bitcoin or none of
[03:20] these crypto tokens represent any real
[03:23] wealth. I mean, they're not um valuable
[03:25] commodities that we use. They're not
[03:28] incomeroucing assets. They're not
[03:30] factories that produce goods. Uh they're
[03:33] just digital tokens that that do
[03:35] nothing. And just because we have a
[03:37] bunch of them doesn't mean we're
[03:39] wealthy. But what happens is some people
[03:41] that bought early, they get wealthy
[03:45] because the wealth is transferred from
[03:47] the people who get in late to them. And
[03:49] you always have the bag holders, the
[03:51] people that get in at the end. and you
[03:54] know their losses equal the profits of
[03:56] the early adopters who cashed out. And
[03:58] so I was you know suggesting that people
[04:00] consider where they think we are because
[04:04] if you're you know coming in at the end
[04:06] you know you're just going to get left
[04:08] holding the bag uh as the market
[04:10] implodes.
 So you think we're coming to
[04:12] the end of an era a Bitcoin era you
[04:15] would say?
 Well we'll see. I mean, is
[04:16] there going to be another leg with all
[04:18] these politicians and Wall Street money
[04:21] or, you know, is this again evidence of
[04:24] a massive top when you have this kind of
[04:27] euphoria?
 Well, we've had multiple tops,
[04:30] wouldn't you say, like peaks in the in
[04:32] bull markets? Yeah, we've had peaks that
[04:34] turned out to just been temporary and
[04:37] all the pullbacks have been bought and
[04:39] we've made new highs, but you know, the
[04:42] progress has been slowing because if you
[04:44] look at the peak in 2021, that peak and
[04:49] measure the price of Bitcoin in real
[04:51] money, gold, right, not dollars or other
[04:54] currencies, but Bitcoin today, even
[04:57] atund, you know, 7,000, wherever it is,
[05:00] and with gold at 3,300 00 and change.
[05:03] Bitcoin is 10% lower priced in gold now
[05:07] than it was in November of 2021.
[05:10] Uh so, you know, you're getting close to
[05:12] four years actually
[05:14] um where Bitcoin is lower despite all
[05:18] the hype, despite all the Wall Street
[05:20] money, all the politics, all these
[05:22] conferences.
 Wouldn't that mean that
[05:24] it's being more stable rather than the
[05:28] bubble about tours?
 Well, but people
[05:30] aren't buying Bitcoin for stability.
[05:32] They're buying Bitcoin to get rich.
[05:33] They're buying Bitcoin because they
[05:35] think it's going to go to the moon. And
[05:36] what I'm saying is it seems like it's
[05:38] running out of steam. The big money has
[05:41] been selling into all the hype and we
[05:45] could be making a major top. Uh and you
[05:48] know, the next drop may not be a buying
[05:51] opportunity. You know, we could keep
[05:53] dropping. You mentioned tokens and how
[05:56] everybody's like, you know, the rich
[05:58] that the people that went in first will
[06:01] get rich, but all the Bitcoin hasn't
[06:04] been mined yet. So, how where does that
[06:06] fit in?
 Well, most of it has been mined.
[06:08] Most of it, but we still have We're not
[06:10] going to see it. We still have until
[06:12] like 2140 to see the last Bitcoin. So,
[06:15] how would that make it like a Ponzi
[06:17] scheme?
 Well, I I don't know that people
[06:19] are even going to care about it in 2140.
[06:22] It's a Ponzi or pyramid or chain letter
[06:25] in that Bitcoin itself does not generate
[06:29] any income. It's not like a piece of
[06:33] property that you can rent out. It's not
[06:35] a stock that has earnings that pays
[06:37] dividends. It's not a bond that pays
[06:40] interest. It's not a commodity that you
[06:42] could use like like gold. Was that its
[06:45] true intention or wasn't it to be like a
[06:47] medium of exchange and just to eliminate
[06:49] the
 Yeah, but except Bitcoin is not a
[06:51] very good medium of exchange. Very few
[06:53] Well, it's very slow. It's very
[06:54] expensive and the more people that try
[06:56] to use it as a medium of exchange, the
[06:58] slower and more expensive it gets. So,
[07:01] it can't scale to any degree. So, that's
[07:04] why people just hold it because they
[07:06] think it's going to go up. But why
[07:07] should it go up if it doesn't have any
[07:09] real utility other than the fact that
[07:11] you could hold on to it and hope it goes
[07:12] up? What about the US dollars that don't
[07:14] really have any value and they keep
[07:16] printing and we still use them
 that yeah
[07:18] that's a problem too. That's why that's
[07:20] why people should not hold dollars long
[07:21] run either. But the dollar is a good
[07:25] medium of exchange. It's very easy to
[07:27] buy sell things in dollars. But you
[07:30] don't want to hold dollars for a long
[07:32] period of time because they're going to
[07:33] lose purchasing power. That's why you
[07:35] want to invest. You want to own real
[07:37] assets. You want to own stocks. You want
[07:38] to own real estate. You want to own
[07:40] gold. But I don't think you want to own
[07:42] Bitcoin for that reason. Bitcoin is pure
[07:44] of a pure speculation.
 So you say it can
[07:47] crash and everything and obviously
[07:48] you're known as the number one critic of
[07:51] Bitcoin. Do you own any Bitcoin?
 Well, I
[07:55] mean, not really. I mean, I set up this
[07:57] strategic Bitcoin reserve kind of to
[08:00] make fun of the government's strategic
[08:02] reserve because the government said,
[08:04] "Oh, we're going to have this reserve,
[08:05] but we're only going to get Bitcoin in a
[08:07] revenue neutral way. we don't want to
[08:10] use taxpayer money, but if we can figure
[08:12] out how to get some free Bitcoin, we'll
[08:14] do it. And so I set up my strategic
[08:17] reserve based on the same concept. Uh I
[08:20] said if I can get free Bitcoin, I'll
[08:22] I'll take it.
 Okay.
 And I published I
[08:24] published my address. I mean, I've
[08:26] gotten some maybe I got about at the
[08:28] current market price maybe about $6,000
[08:31] of Bitcoin. I mean, not much, but I you
[08:34] know, I've committed to never sell it,
[08:35] you know, like a true Bitcoiner.
 Okay.
[08:37] Hey, I bought one of these like tzors or
[08:39] whatever it is.
 Yeah.
 And I said, "Look,
[08:41] here's the Bitcoin. You can put it in
[08:43] there and you can watch it. I'm never
[08:45] going to touch it. You can just see what
[08:46] happens to my, you know, strategic
[08:49] reserve." I mean, I don't really look at
[08:51] it as my Bitcoin because, you know, I'm
[08:53] I'm just going to leave it there as an
[08:55] experiment to see what happens to it.
[08:56] Well, that's the best way to do it. You
[08:58] know, if I give you a free Bitcoin, why
[09:00] wouldn't you take it? You know what I
[09:02] mean?
 Well, exactly. Yeah. But I
[09:04] wouldn't buy it. I don't want to waste
[09:05] my money buying it. But if somebody
[09:07] gifts it to me, I mean, sure, I'll
[09:09] accept it.
 I've been hearing around you
[09:11] live in in PR and you're notorious for
[09:14] having like these amazing parties in
[09:17] Puerto Rico. And two, you're many have
[09:21] said that you're kind of like a closeted
[09:23] Bitcoiner. Would you say that you are?
[09:25] No, I think there because we're kindered
[09:27] spirits in a lot of the economic
[09:31] philosophy of free markets and Austrian
[09:35] economics. And that's why I mentioned
[09:37] when I did my panel because when I'm
[09:38] here, people are constantly coming up to
[09:40] me wanting, you know, a photograph with
[09:43] me. But they tell me that I'm the reason
[09:46] they own Bitcoin because they listen to
[09:49] me years ago about economics, about
[09:52] sound money and and and the Fed and
[09:54] inflation. And I'm the one that got them
[09:57] into Bitcoin. I mean, maybe they started
[09:59] with gold, but then they went to Bitcoin
[10:01] or they went straight to Bitcoin. But if
[10:03] it wasn't for me educating them on
[10:06] economics, they never would have found
[10:08] it. So even though it wasn't my
[10:10] intention that they buy Bitcoin, that
[10:13] was what happened. And and you know, and
[10:15] then of course there's that group of
[10:17] people that just think I'm a contrarian
[10:19] indicator. And every time I I post on X
[10:23] something negative about Bitcoin, they
[10:25] go and buy more. In fact, they actually
[10:27] have programs now that you can
[10:30] automatically buy Bitcoin for you when I
[10:32] say something about. So like I'm like I
[10:35] got all these people into Bitcoin and
[10:37] now they're all buying Bitcoin because
[10:39] of me. So that's why when people were
[10:41] like, "Well, why are you at this Bitcoin
[10:42] conference?" I said, "Well, I'm the most
[10:44] relevant person here. I'm the I got more
[10:46] people to buy Bitcoin than anyone else."
[10:48] Come on. You're you're a Bitcoiner, fam.
[10:50] You got to admit it.
 It's just like I
[10:51] got people I got more people to move to
[10:53] Puerto Rico. I was like one of the first
[10:55] people there and then the Bitcoiners
[10:57] followed me there.
 And you were also one
[10:59] of the 50 to predict the crash in08.
 I
[11:03] didn't know there were 50, but I
 Yeah,
[11:05] they told me.
 I didn't know there were
[11:06] that many.
 That's funny. But has many
[11:08] Bitcoiners that have come up to you and
[11:09] asked for these pictures. Have any of
[11:12] them tried or persuaded you to have like
[11:15] a change of heart?
 Oh, almost all of
[11:16] them.
 Yeah. What's their like pitch that
[11:19] they go to? Oh, well they're all
[11:20] similar, but like e everybody kind of
[11:22] wants me on the team, right? It's like
[11:24] I'm like the star player. Then like if
[11:27] we can get Peter, if we can convince
[11:28] Peter, like I represent like the last
[11:31] hold out of the old guard because then
[11:33] if they turn me, then it's opening up a
[11:36] floodgate, right, of the boomer
[11:38] generation that is resistant to this new
[11:41] idea, right? So it's it's a goal. It's
[11:44] aspirational. And I think a lot of the
[11:46] people that believe in Bitcoin and you
[11:48] know I don't believe in it but they
[11:50] believe that I'll eventually come around
[11:52] because they they're so convinced that
[11:54] they're right and they know that I'm a
[11:56] smart person. They just assume that I'll
[11:59] eventually get it. But I look at it as
[12:01] you know they're so you know invested
[12:04] emotionally and mentally that the
[12:06] cognitive dissonance and and the group
[12:08] think is so strong that it never occurs
[12:11] to them that I'm the one that's right
[12:13] and that they're wrong.
[12:15] Have you put in the 100 hours of Bitcoin
[12:18] to learn it? I just like, have you read
[12:20] the books? I'm very curious. Like, be
[12:23] honest. Be honest. Like, no judging
[12:24] here.
 I knew about Bitcoin long before
[12:27] most people here knew about it. So, I've
[12:30] had more than a 100 hours. Look, I mean,
[12:32] I
 would say the loopholes are that just
[12:36] don't align to you that you're like,
 I
[12:39] just I don't see it. I I I think it's
[12:41] very the the technology and the way it
[12:44] works and all that stuff is very
[12:46] interesting and very compelling. Uh and
[12:49] I think it's a sexy story if you don't
[12:51] really get the nuances. When I first
[12:54] learned about it in 2010 and it was
[12:56] like, you know, a dollar, whatever. I
[12:58] think I remember it being under a dollar
[13:00] and watching it. Oh, now it's a dollar.
[13:01] H, you know, but um and thinking about
[13:04] buying it. I think if I had really
[13:06] known, maybe I would have thrown 10
[13:08] grand or 50 grand at it back then and
[13:10] maybe I'd have an extra billion dollars
[13:12] today. I don't know, you know, assuming
[13:14] I would have holdled it. I'm sure I
[13:16] would have kept some. There's no way I
[13:18] could have like kept it all if I bought,
[13:20] you know, a million Bitcoin or 100,000
[13:22] Bitcoin back then. I mean, it's I'm sure
[13:24] I would have I would have I would have
[13:26] had to have cash out at least some of
[13:27] it. But um I I think that the promoters
[13:30] that got in like the Winkle Boss and all
[13:32] these guys, you know, they did a hell of
[13:34] a job like promoting what they own and
[13:37] it's just a giant pump and dump scheme
[13:39] that's taken on this massive proportion
[13:43] and has now basically, you know, sucked
[13:46] in Wall Street with all these Bitcoin
[13:49] treasury companies and ETFs and now you
[13:52] got the governments, not only the
[13:53] federal government, but all these state
[13:55] governments that want to just buy
[13:57] Bitcoin. I mean, so it's it's mass of
[13:59] the scale of this, you know, the scheme,
[14:01] but in the end, it's all going to
[14:03] collapse and they'll write about it in
[14:05] the history books, right? You know, I
[14:07] mean, there's a guy here that showed me
[14:09] he has a Bitcoin museum. He was showing
[14:11] me and I said, "Yeah, that's where
[14:12] Bitcoin is going to be relegated to a
[14:14] museum. It's like a museum of financial
[14:16] manas and you could put Bitcoin there as
[14:19] as as the biggest one and people could
[14:21] go to museum and learn about this
[14:23] digital token that we call Bitcoin, but
[14:25] they're not going to be using it in the
[14:27] future for anything.
 But there's been a
[14:29] lot of talk of using Bitcoin with AI
[14:31] because obviously with AI, you don't
[14:33] really AI can't create a bank account.
[14:36] You know, there's all these different
[14:38] use cases for Bitcoin in the future.
[14:41] What do you do you think?
 I don't know.
[14:43] I mean, There's no bit use cases for it
[14:46] now. I don't know. But
 no, but are you a
[14:49] little salty that you didn't buy back
[14:51] then in 201
[14:54] Come on. Come on, my friend.
 I don't
[14:55] know if salty is the word. I mean, look,
[14:58] it's not like I I I have a hard time
[15:01] sleeping at night because I didn't buy
[15:02] Bitcoin. I mean, I've made a lot of
[15:04] mistakes from a you know, I things I
[15:07] could have bought, would have, could
[15:08] have, should have. you know, I bought
[15:10] things that have gone up and I've, you
[15:12] know, done done well on certain
[15:13] investments. Clearly, I could have done
[15:15] better had I just put all my chips off
[15:17] Bitcoin when I first learned about it.
[15:19] Like, but, you know, I didn't do that.
[15:21] But, you know, I got a good life, you
[15:23] know. I mean, you know, I mean, I got
[15:24] plenty of money. It's not like, you
[15:26] know, yeah, sure, I can have more. I
[15:27] think a lot of the investments that I've
[15:29] made, I think you're going to do better
[15:31] than Bitcoin from here, right? Even if
[15:33] Bitcoin goes up, I think I own a lot of
[15:35] things that will go up more, but I think
[15:37] there's a there's a big risk that
[15:38] Bitcoin is going to go
 more than
[15:39] Bitcoin.
 Well, almost everything because
[15:41] I think Bitcoin is going down.
 But you
[15:43] also mentioned that Bitcoin has no
[15:45] intrinsic value. What does intrinsic
[15:47] value really even mean?
 Well, again, you
[15:50] have to separate Bitcoin from being able
[15:53] to be used as a medium of exchange.
 But
[15:56] why?
 Isn't that the main theory of it
[15:58] though? Like electronic cash system?
 The
[16:01] origin of money. Why is gold money?
[16:04] Well, I mean gold is money because it's
[16:06] a it's a commodity. So, it represents
[16:09] real value. You're wearing some gold
[16:10] jewelry, right? Jewelry is one use of
[16:13] gold, but there are a lot of other uses.
[16:15] It's the most useful metal that we have.
[16:17] It has properties that are very unique
[16:20] to gold and extremely valuable for all
[16:22] sorts of industrial applications. Right?
[16:24] So, gold has value. If you've got
[16:26] something that you want to sell me, I
[16:29] can pay for it in gold. You can give me
[16:31] a valuable good and I can give you
[16:34] something valuable in exchange as
[16:35] opposed to barter. Like you know in in
[16:38] prison, cigarettes are money.
 Exactly.
[16:40] Why are cigarettes money? Because you
[16:42] can smoke them, right? Because there's a
[16:44] there's an intrinsic value of a
[16:46] cigarette. But let's say we're in prison
[16:48] and you want to buy something for me and
[16:50] pay me in cigarettes. Even if I don't
[16:52] smoke, I'll take the cigarettes because
[16:55] I know somebody else does. And even if
[16:57] the other person doesn't smoke, they'll
[16:58] take it because ultimately someone's
[17:00] going to smoke those cigarettes. So you
[17:02] can smoke a cigarette. That's the
[17:03] intrinsic value. There's nothing you can
[17:05] do with Bitcoin. You can't smoke it. You
[17:07] can't do anything with it except give it
[17:09] to somebody else. Gold, I can use my
[17:11] gold as me exchange, but I can also melt
[17:14] it down and make jewelry or conduct
[17:15] electricity.
 You can't do that with
[17:17] actual fiat though, like
 money. Yeah,
[17:20] fiat currency isn't money either. It's
[17:22] currency. The difference between
[17:24] currency and money. Currency is a money
[17:26] substitute. Now, you can have legitimate
[17:29] currency that's backed by money, right,
[17:30] which would be gold, or you can have
[17:32] fiat currency that's backed by nothing.
[17:34] And the fiat system is bad. Fiat
[17:36] currency works well for a while,
[17:41] especially as a medium of exchange, unit
[17:42] of account, but it's a lousy long-term
[17:45] store of value. That's why it's not
[17:47] good. Gold is much better. And when you
[17:49] talked about AI, we can take gold and
[17:53] bring it into the future using the
[17:55] technology of the internet or even
[17:57] blockchain. You can tokenize gold and
[18:01] now ownership of gold can be represented
[18:03] digitally and be transferred
[18:06] from peertopeer all around the world
[18:09] quickly, inexpensively, much faster,
[18:11] much cheaper to do that.
 But Bitcoin
[18:14] doesn't do it well. It's slow and
[18:15] expensive.
 How would this token with
[18:17] gold do it? much faster and much
[18:19] cheaper.
 How?
 Because it does you don't
[18:21] have to you don't you don't have the
[18:24] expensive gas and you it Bitcoin doesn't
[18:27] even scale. You can't you can't do it.
[18:29] You it's it that that's why nobody uses
[18:32] it. They just hold on to it and hope it
[18:34] goes up. Well, look, I'm going to have
[18:36] my own token at some point. You have to
[18:38] trust me. But I'll have a third party
[18:40] auditor that'll come in and audit it and
[18:42] hey, yeah, the gold's there. And you can
[18:44] have a real-time audit. You can see, you
[18:46] know, the gold that stands behind your
[18:48] token and you have it redeemable. If you
[18:51] want your gold, you just take your token
[18:53] and redeem it. I mail you the gold.
 You
[18:55] can audit Bitcoin, though. That's what
[18:57] the nodes are for.
 Yeah, but you're
[18:58] auditing nothing. When you're auditing
[19:00] gold, you're auditing something. Bitcoin
[19:02] is nothing. It is a worthless string of
[19:05] numbers that has no value other than the
[19:08] the hope that if you buy it, somebody
[19:10] else will buy it and pay more. If you're
[19:12] stuck spending dollars, at least stop
[19:15] earning fiat rewards. Use Fold and earn
[19:18] Bitcoin on everyday spending, groceries,
[19:21] travel, even paying bills. And take
[19:24] advantage of Bitcoin rewards with
[19:26] merchants you might already shop with.
[19:29] It's the easiest way to stack sats. So,
[19:32] if you're in the United States and you
[19:34] don't have Fold yet, what are you doing?
[19:37] Buy, earn, and save in Bitcoin, all in
[19:40] one app. Fold is the ultimate toolkit
[19:43] for making Bitcoin savings a daily
[19:45] habit.
[19:48] [Music]
[20:03] [Music]
[20:15] Speaking of AI, your son Spencer thinks
[20:18] AI is going to lead us to a deflationary
[20:22] future. Do you agree?
 Well, I believe
[20:26] that AI has the potential to vastly
[20:30] increase productivity. And what
[20:32] productivity does is lowers prices. It
[20:34] creates more supply and so a lower
[20:37] price. And I think that is going to
[20:39] happen. Now government offsets that by
[20:42] creating inflation. Inflation just puts
[20:45] upward pressure on prices. The free
[20:48] market puts downward pressure on prices.
[20:50] But if AI is so uh productive
[20:55] that it puts more downward pressure than
[20:58] the government puts upward pressure,
[21:00] yes, you know, we'll have falling
[21:02] prices. You know, we had falling prices
[21:03] in America for over a 100 years before
[21:06] we invented the Federal Reserve. So that
[21:08] is the natural tendency. But you know,
[21:10] we may have to go through hyperinflation
[21:12] first. Who knows? But yeah, I think that
[21:16] 100 years from now the real cost of
[21:18] goods and services will be dramatically
[21:20] less than it is today. Capitalism and we
[21:23] still have some capitalism left. I wish
[21:25] we had more but it's very dynamic and it
[21:29] it's a force for good and for higher
[21:32] living standards and it just has to
[21:35] overcome the force for bad that is
[21:39] exerted by government which is there
[21:41] which is like a huge impediment
[21:43] roadblock uh inhibiting progress. That's
[21:46] why if you look at countries that have
[21:47] the most government the totalitarian
[21:50] communist government there's no progress
[21:51] at all. government has completely
[21:53] blocked it. But to the extent that you
[21:56] can limit the power of government, you
[21:58] can have progress, you can have
[22:00] prosperity.
 So I want to touch on like
[22:02] what many Bitcoiners say online. Many
[22:05] say that gold failed the test in the
[22:08] digital era because it requires too much
[22:11] trust to transact with.
 No, that's just
[22:14] made up. Like the gold asteroid that's
[22:16] going to come down and make gold
[22:18] worthless because it's going to be so
[22:19] abundant. But gold has never failed
[22:21] anything. People failed. We were on a
[22:25] gold standard for a long time. It worked
[22:27] great. But the government abandoned it
[22:29] because they didn't want to follow the
[22:31] discipline that gold was imposing. So if
[22:34] you stick on a gold standard, it works
[22:36] beautifully. If you give up on it, if
[22:38] you abandon it, that's not gold's fault.
[22:40] Gold is just a metal. And and to say
[22:42] that Bitcoin is going to succeed where
[22:44] gold failed is ridiculous because
[22:47] governments are no more gonna adopt a
[22:49] Bitcoin standard than than a gold
[22:51] standard because the government can't
[22:53] print Bitcoin, right? They'd have to
[22:54] mine it or they have to buy it just like
[22:56] gold. And they don't they don't want the
[22:59] discipline.
 But wouldn't like going back
[23:01] to a Bitcoin I mean a gold standard be
[23:04] practically impossible? Well, you know,
[23:06] it would require some fiscal discipline,
[23:08] but all you have to do is rep the dollar
[23:10] to gold. Now, you couldn't do it at
[23:13] $3,300 an ounce unless you had massive
[23:16] deflation. So, you'd have to raise the
[23:17] price of gold much higher official
[23:20] devaluation of the dollar. Maybe gold
[23:22] has to be 20,000 an ounce, 30,000, I
[23:24] don't know. But once you fix it, then
[23:27] it's fixed. Then the government has to
[23:29] keep the money supply constant so that
[23:32] it has the goal to back it up at
[23:34] whatever the ratio is. And then they
[23:35] have to cut government spending or they
[23:37] have to raise taxes so that the Fed
[23:39] doesn't have to print more money because
[23:41] they can't print more money unless they
[23:43] have more gold.
 You know, I do have to
[23:45] admit your argument
[23:48] confused me because
 No, you're starting
[23:50] to see the first
 I'm on pilling you. No,
[23:54] no, you're not. Because
 I'm golding you
[23:56] because first you're like saying that
[23:58] Bitcoin's not gonna succeed and then you
[24:01] want to tokenize gold and then put it
[24:04] into AI. I'm like my friend, I'm
[24:07] confused.
 No, but that can work. Bitcoin
[24:09] can't. Gold can do everything that
[24:11] Bitcoin.
 No, because that's even worse
[24:14] since you would create your own token.
[24:16] You would it would be sort of like
 but
[24:18] the token is just a digital
[24:21] representation of the gold that backs it
[24:23] up. That's dig that's real digital gold.
[24:26] Tokenized gold is real digital gold.
 But
[24:29] it would have the creator that it would
[24:30] be you. Like for example, you have
[24:32] Bitcoin that has the immaculate
[24:34] conception. Like we don't know who
[24:35] created it. The man or the woman has
[24:38] disappeared
 that well maybe it was
[24:40] created with some nefarious purpose. I
[24:42] don't know. Maybe there's some back door
[24:44] in there that none of us know about. I
[24:46] mean, how do you know? Look, do do you
[24:48] have do you have health insurance?
 Yes.
[24:50] You're trusting a health insurance
[24:52] company. The whole concept of insurance
[24:54] is trusting a third party to pay your
[24:57] claim.
 And the whole point of Bitcoin is
[24:59] you don't trust you verify.
 But the
[25:02] problem with Bitcoin is there's nothing
[25:04] there.
 Like, would you trust me with
[25:06] your gold right now? But I'd rather
[25:08] trust somebody with my gold than trust,
[25:11] you know, the community not to lose
[25:13] confidence in a worthless asset.
 One of
[25:15] the reasons why it kind of didn't work
[25:17] was because the banks, the trusted third
[25:20] parties were lying about the gold that
[25:22] they had in store.
 Well, the no only the
[25:25] government was. Private custodians
[25:28] didn't lie because the free market put
[25:30] pressure on them to be honest. You know,
[25:32] once you have a reputation, you want to
[25:34] defend it. Like Brinks, for example, has
[25:36] been in business for about 150 years.
[25:39] They've never lost an ounce of gold that
[25:41] they've stored for other third other
[25:43] people. Now, I'm sure along the way,
[25:46] maybe they lost some or some was stolen,
[25:48] but they made good because they have a
[25:50] reputation that they don't want to be
[25:54] tarnished because that brand, that
[25:56] reputation has value in the marketplace.
[25:59] And in a free market, people compete
[26:02] with a brand for confidence and safety.
[26:06] And the same thing would happen with
[26:08] tokenized gold. You'd have all kinds of
[26:10] happen if you admit you're a Bitcoiner.
[26:13] It would destroy your whole world.
 You
[26:15] could say, "Look, I'm a Bitcoiner at
[26:16] heart, but not at mine."
 I love that.
[26:19] Too smart to be to be a bit
 No, no, no.
[26:22] That is gold. So, that leads me to We're
[26:25] going to play a mini game right now.
[26:26] Okay. that you're a Bitcoiner at heart,
[26:28] which I like because I want you to give
[26:31] me your best and honest positive
[26:36] pitch for Bitcoin.
[26:38] Yeah, people will take it seriously. But
[26:40] look, it's the same pitch for gold
[26:42] because people are substituting Bitcoin
[26:44] for gold. But I I say, look, we need an
[26:46] alternative. People need to unbank
[26:48] themselves from this fiat fractional
[26:51] reserve monetary system. And you know, I
[26:54] think gold is the best alternative.
[26:56] Maybe silver at the point because it's
[26:58] cheap. But the same reasons that I tell
[27:00] people to buy gold and silver is the
[27:03] reason that other people buy Bitcoin.
[27:05] But I think there are a lot of people
[27:06] that buy Bitcoin that have no idea what
[27:09] they're doing. They're just buying it
[27:10] because they they were told to buy it.
[27:12] Their friend bought it, made money, they
[27:14] think they're going to get rich, you
[27:15] know, there. So there's a lot of just
[27:17] rampant speculation in the space. And
[27:19] again, look, look at all, you know, look
[27:21] at how the Bitcoin maxis look at
[27:25] everybody else buying the altcoins and
[27:27] how, oh, all those coins are nothing.
[27:29] They're all worthless, but Bitcoin is
[27:31] great. When in many cases, there's
[27:34] really not much difference between the
[27:35] coins that you guys hate and and
[27:38] Bitcoin.
 I know. Elaborate. Elaborate.
[27:40] No, no, no, no. that what do you mean
[27:42] there's not that big of a difference
[27:43] between
 because fundamentally they have
[27:45] a lot more in common than they have in
[27:47] you know different to say that oh you
[27:49] know all these tokens are worthless but
[27:52] Bitcoin's not
 because you know it was
[27:55] first or you know it's the most
[27:57] decentralized or you know whatever the
[27:59] you have it's like saying that different
[28:01] types of metals you know silver is not
[28:03] the same as gold
 no it's not it's not
[28:06] the same but um I think that bit there
[28:11] are a lot of coins that have a lot more
[28:13] in common with Bitcoin than silver has
[28:15] in common with gold. Yeah, they're both
[28:17] metals and in some cases you could
[28:19] substitute them.
 But what would you do
[28:20] in places like for example in Africa in
[28:23] third world countries that they don't
[28:25] have the privilege to own gold. What
[28:28] would be they don't even have bank
[28:29] accounts.
 Well, they can buy gold and
[28:31] you know what they should do if they
[28:32] were going to get into a a crypto? They
[28:36] should be buying crypto backed by gold.
[28:37] they should be buying real tokenized
[28:39] gold and they can use that as as a mean
[28:42] of exchange. They can use that as a
[28:45] store of value. You know, it works much
[28:47] better than than than Bitcoin and it's
[28:50] certainly much better than a a US dollar
[28:52] stable coin because those work well as
[28:55] you know exchange, but they're a lousy
[28:58] store of value. You know, the stable
[29:00] coins make a lot of money for the
[29:02] issuers because they use other people's
[29:04] money to buy treasuries and they get the
[29:06] interest, but then you have a bunch of
[29:08] people who own the stable coin that get
[29:10] no interest and just get killed to
[29:13] inflation, you know, if they hold it.
 I
[29:16] I'm inviting you to Islam so you can see
[29:18] how a Bitcoin circular economy is
[29:21] actually changing people's lives.
[29:22] Where's that?
 In Mexico.
 Cancun.
 Well, I
[29:26] might go, you know, I I got a boat. I
[29:28] might So I might if I take it from me
[29:30] from Puerto Rico to Cancun.
 That's
[29:32] perfect. Yeah.
 And then you we can test
[29:34] out if the gold with the people will be
[29:37] better
 than the Bitcoin. I don't know
[29:40] how they're going to buy the gold, but
[29:41] no. And the last question I have for you
[29:44] is what is your hottest take on Bitcoin?
[29:47] I have the same take I've always had. I
[29:49] think it's I call it a Ponzi, a pyramid,
[29:51] a blockchain letter. I haven't changed
[29:53] my position on Bitcoin since I first
[29:57] discovered it. But, you know, I
[29:58] outsmarted myself out of a lot of a lot
[30:00] of money. You know, I I overthought it
[30:02] back then. Just the potential of other
[30:04] people not getting it but buying it
[30:06] anyway. Just because the story was
[30:09] interesting enough, but I didn't even
[30:11] imagine that, you know, Wall Street
[30:14] would embrace it the way they did
[30:15] because they they weren't even
[30:16] interested in gold. So, why would they
[30:18] be interested in some digital version of
[30:20] it that purported to be gold? But if
[30:22] there was ever a bubble that was built
[30:24] for me, this was it. I mean, this could
[30:26] have been my bubble. This whole thing
[30:28] could have been Peter Schiff because if
[30:30] I would have bought Bitcoin, I could
[30:32] have promoted it. And that was one of
[30:34] the reason I didn't even want to buy it
[30:36] is because I didn't want to tell other
[30:37] people to buy it because I knew I would
[30:39] pump up the price. And I felt badly
[30:42] about buying it and then getting other
[30:43] people. But this was a Peter Schiff
[30:45] bubble. It was right up my alley because
[30:47] I missed the dot bubble because I I I
[30:49] knew that it was going to end badly. So,
[30:52] I never got in that. I never got in the
[30:54] housing bubble on the way up, you know,
[30:56] and and but this bubble was tailor made
[30:58] for me. I could have really made a
[31:00] killing off the Bitcoin bubble, but I I
[31:02] I sat it out. And a lot of people have
[31:04] come to me, you know, oh, let's do a
[31:06] Peterhip memecoin. There's so many
[31:08] people and I look I don't want to I
[31:09] don't I don't want to mislead people. I
[31:12] don't want to encourage people to throw
[31:13] their money away even if it enriches me.
[31:16] And so I didn't want to just, you know,
[31:18] do what Donald Trump did and come out
[31:21] with Trumpcoin and pocket hundreds of
[31:24] millions of dollars and take advantage
[31:26] of people that were buying the coin. And
[31:28] I I don't want to make money that. I
[31:29] want to make an honest living.
 I love
[31:31] that. Honest living. So no tokenization.
[31:34] And
 well, I'll tokenize gold. That's
[31:36] honest. That's real money. You can't get
[31:38] rich quick with gold. But what you can
[31:41] do is avoid going broke.
 I do like gold,
[31:43] so I cannot argue with that.
 Yeah. Well,
[31:45] you're wearing it well.
 Bueno.
