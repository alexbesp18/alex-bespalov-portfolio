[00:00] Good afternoon everyone. Um so quick uh
[00:04] clarification 580,000
[00:07] plus Bitcoin.
[00:11] Um you you have to keep your head on a
[00:14] swivel because every Monday, as you guys
[00:16] know, we update our Bitcoin huddle and
[00:20] uh you know, I think you expect
[00:21] something more every week. So we're very
[00:23] proud of that. Um first off, I just want
[00:26] to say thank you guys uh for being here.
[00:28] Uh this is my second year uh at the the
[00:31] Bitcoin conference. I was able to take
[00:34] part last year uh at Nashville. And so
[00:36] I'm really excited uh to be here again
[00:38] with you all today. So I'm going to
[00:41] spend the next uh
[00:44] 12 maybe less minutes or so. So this
[00:47] will not be um a earnings call length uh
[00:51] session for me. Although you will get
[00:53] some more strategy from uh Fong Lee, our
[00:56] CEO, and Michael Sailor, our executive
[00:58] chairman after this. So, you'll get some
[01:00] more content. So, I'll try and keep mine
[01:02] brief. And I want to focus uh my remarks
[01:05] on how strategy is really transforming
[01:09] uh capital uh with a real focus on uh
[01:13] bringing yield instruments to the market
[01:15] that uh traditionally have we've not
[01:17] seen before. and and it's a truly in
[01:19] innovative way in which we're trying to
[01:22] create more opportunities for investors
[01:25] both retail and institutional to have
[01:28] exposure not just to strategy but also
[01:30] to Bitcoin.
[01:32] So this first slide um is uh just a
[01:36] breakdown of the the distribution of
[01:38] global wealth in the world. I think
[01:40] you've seen this in our presentations
[01:42] before. Um I'll note we have here now
[01:44] the global wealth total has increased uh
[01:48] to we have a a thousand trillion
[01:51] otherwise known as a quadrillion. Uh so
[01:53] every every day every week uh the the
[01:56] wealth of of our entire world continues
[01:59] to grow. You can see here Bitcoin is
[02:01] about $2 trillion of of that uh
[02:05] quadrillion uh of global wealth and it's
[02:08] growing every day. I remember when it
[02:10] was a trillion dollars not too long ago.
[02:12] And so we're s certainly seeing the
[02:15] strong momentum in Bitcoin. But I think
[02:17] the point of this slide is to show you
[02:19] that there is a lot more that Bitcoin
[02:21] can take in terms of market share
[02:24] related to the overall global wealth
[02:26] distribution of the world. And the way
[02:28] strategy is focusing in on uh trying to
[02:32] uh generate more opportunities for yield
[02:34] is focusing in on the bond market in
[02:37] particular among many. Um, as you know,
[02:39] we've been active uh in our uh common
[02:41] equity offerings. We've been active in
[02:43] converts. I'll talk about that a little
[02:44] bit later. But really, the most
[02:47] innovative structures we put forth this
[02:49] year are in our preferred equity
[02:51] offerings where we think we can take a
[02:53] dramatic amount of market share in this
[02:55] over $300 trillion barn market. So, as
[02:59] we start to see these box boxes shift,
[03:01] we know that Bitcoin is a a finite
[03:03] asset. It'll grow continue to grow in
[03:06] market cap. And as a result of that
[03:08] digital transformation of capital, uh
[03:11] we'll all expect Bitcoin price itself to
[03:13] increase.
[03:16] So I mentioned Strike and Strife. Uh
[03:18] those are our two uh unique preferred
[03:21] equity offerings we launched earlier
[03:22] this year. You can see Strife uh NASDAQ
[03:26] ticker STRF
[03:28] um is a perpetual preferred uh stock
[03:32] offering. It has a 10% cash dividend and
[03:36] it has a 6.9 times BTC rating. BTC
[03:40] rating is a financial concept that we
[03:42] developed to try and uh articulate how
[03:46] much over collateralization or coverage
[03:48] of Bitcoin we have relative to the
[03:50] specific instrument. So if you look at
[03:52] 6.9 times coverage that means we have
[03:55] more than se you know close to seven
[03:57] times the Bitcoin to be able to manage
[04:00] uh you know this this security in the
[04:01] market.
[04:02] Strike uh is also a preferred equity
[04:05] offering we announced earlier this year
[04:08] um that is slightly unique. It has an 8%
[04:10] cash dividend and it also has a
[04:12] conversion feature that allows you to
[04:14] convert uh to MSTR common equity uh at a
[04:18] conversion price of $1,000. So this also
[04:21] has a six over six times Bitcoin uh BTC
[04:25] rating which means again in the broad
[04:27] scheme of preferred equity we have a
[04:30] balance sheet that is strong enough and
[04:33] more strong I would say stronger than
[04:34] most issuers of preferred equity to
[04:37] cover our obligations on on these
[04:38] instruments
[04:42] performance. So, Strike and Strife are
[04:46] two of the highest performing preferred
[04:50] equity offerings in the market period.
[04:54] Um, we launched both of those earlier
[04:56] this year. This is just uh the last
[04:58] month. Uh, every time uh you have to
[05:02] again keep your head on the swivel here.
[05:04] We're showing that uh Strife and Striker
[05:07] just about at a at par at a $100 price.
[05:11] Today I think they're trading up closer
[05:12] to 101. So even since we put this
[05:14] presentation together, we're increasing
[05:17] and outperforming the market. If you
[05:18] look at the preferred equity offerings,
[05:21] other type of preferred equity offerings
[05:23] in the market, um they've performed
[05:26] about minus2 to minus 3% over the same
[05:29] period. So while we're performing in the
[05:31] last month 10% in strife since inception
[05:35] it's probably closer to 25%
[05:37] and then strike in the last month was an
[05:39] 18% overperformance whereas other preps
[05:43] are performing at minus2us 3. So again
[05:46] if you're looking if you're an investor
[05:47] who wants opportunity in yield you get
[05:50] an 8 to 10% coupon and you get a dollar
[05:53] performance that's outstripping the
[05:54] market right now.
[05:59] So this slide I my screen's coming up a
[06:02] little odd. Hopefully you guys can see
[06:03] it properly here. But this uh sort of
[06:06] goes a little bit deeper into the
[06:08] comparison of what we offer through
[06:10] strike and strife and what other
[06:12] preferred equity offerings are are are
[06:14] out there for the market. And this I
[06:16] think is a great comparison slide for
[06:18] any investor whether it's institutional
[06:20] or whether it's retail like many of us
[06:22] in this room here to be able to
[06:24] differentiate between the yield
[06:27] offerings that strategy provides
[06:28] relative to what else is available in
[06:30] the market. So I think a couple of the
[06:33] key uh structural elements is that
[06:36] strike and strife are both perpetual.
[06:38] That means they're forever. We always
[06:40] talk about Bitcoin being the forever
[06:42] asset. Strike and Strife are the
[06:44] equivalent forever preferred equity
[06:46] offerings that create that that provide
[06:48] an 8 to 10% yield forever. You won't
[06:52] find that anywhere else. Um the other uh
[06:57] component there is uh the performance I
[06:59] mentioned 26% 18% minus 3% I touched on
[07:03] that. the trading volumes. Um, another
[07:06] very important piece, uh, after we
[07:09] launched these, uh, the current equity
[07:11] market, uh, tends to be a little more
[07:14] specific. A lot of types of issuers have
[07:16] used it in the past. There's not a whole
[07:18] lot of liquidity in that market. So,
[07:20] you're trading through thin volumes. Uh,
[07:23] we've outperformed pretty much any
[07:25] preferred equity offering in terms of
[07:27] volume capacity um, since launching,
[07:30] which to me signals that people care.
[07:32] people want this and more and more
[07:35] people are buying it for the yield it
[07:37] provides. One of the ways we did it
[07:40] which I think was also revolutionary is
[07:42] we listed these on NASDAQ. So anyone in
[07:45] this room which is very different from
[07:47] some of the other you know financial
[07:49] instruments you can buy for investment
[07:50] purposes you can all walk out of this
[07:52] room go onto a platform whether it's
[07:55] Fidelity or SoFi or Robin Hood and buy
[07:58] these preferred equity offerings. That's
[08:01] what's also contributing to the
[08:04] outperformance and liquidity. It's also
[08:06] contributing to people being interested
[08:08] and it'll continue to outperform because
[08:10] of that structural element. And really
[08:12] what we're doing here uh strategy in
[08:15] providing these types of instruments is
[08:17] trying to create a broad distribution.
[08:20] If you think about um convertible bonds
[08:23] for example, it's a great tool we've
[08:25] used. We raised over $8 billion of
[08:27] converts, but it's in a very specific
[08:29] institutional ecosystem. It's very hard
[08:31] for any of us to go and buy a strategy
[08:34] convertible bond. Anyone in this room
[08:36] can walk out of here and buy Strike and
[08:39] Strife um as soon as you leave this this
[08:41] uh this conference room.
[08:53] [Music]
[09:09] [Music]
[09:14] um comparison against other investments
[09:17] as well. Here we we sort of chart yield
[09:20] versus duration. I talked about
[09:21] duration. Here we show an effective
[09:23] duration of somewhere you know in the 10
[09:26] 10 year range but in reality these are
[09:29] perpetual preferreds. There are no call
[09:30] options. They will never come due. You
[09:33] can hold this for 10 years, 15 years.
[09:35] You can hold it for a 100 years. You can
[09:36] pass it down to your children through an
[09:39] estate. These dividends will last
[09:41] forever and get paid quarterly. So again
[09:44] another distinguishing factor. Um and
[09:47] again in yield in yield terms 8 to 10%
[09:51] uh most preps are somewhere in the five
[09:52] to six% range. So really we're offering
[09:56] close to double that. Um and again
[09:58] founded on top of Bitcoin, right? So not
[10:01] founded on top of someone's uh ability
[10:04] to promise future cash flows. We're
[10:06] founded upon the foundation of Bitcoin.
[10:09] And we all know in this room where
[10:11] Bitcoin's going, right? You don't I
[10:12] don't have to promise you that. We all
[10:13] know it's going to go higher.
[10:17] This is uh another chart that we
[10:19] introduced recently that just shows you
[10:21] a little bit more detail of how we think
[10:22] about our capital structure. Um so we've
[10:25] now developed in addition to offering
[10:28] different types of investment
[10:29] opportunities, we're also very diligent
[10:31] and disciplined in how we are
[10:33] structuring our overall capital stack at
[10:36] strategy. You can see MSTR, it's high
[10:38] volatility. Michael has always talked
[10:40] about it being the high volatility. We
[10:42] want more leverage. We want more
[10:44] volatility. We want people to get
[10:46] upside. You get some downside with that.
[10:48] It tracks the Bitcoin price. Um because
[10:51] of our leverage, we, you know, when
[10:53] Bitcoin's up, uh MSTR tends to be up
[10:56] more. When it's down, it tends to be
[10:58] down a little bit more, but we all know
[10:59] where it's headed, which is which is
[11:01] much more up than it is today. So, high
[11:03] volatility,
[11:04] um and and and and high exposure to
[11:07] Bitcoin. Um STRK, which is our
[11:09] convertible, is sort of in the middle
[11:11] ground. It has a little bit um of uh a
[11:15] little bit of exposure because it has a
[11:17] convertible feature. So, you know, if
[11:19] MSTR gets to $1,000, you could convert
[11:22] that to MSTR equity to get that high
[11:25] leverage, high volatility exposure. Or
[11:28] you could just simply clip a coupon at
[11:30] 8% for the rest of your life. And that
[11:33] in itself is is a very valuable
[11:35] financial instrument. Strife is our most
[11:38] senior, our most high quality, our most
[11:41] what we call pristine part of our
[11:43] capital structure. Um, it has a lot of
[11:46] upside, 10% coupon forever, uh, with
[11:49] with no no downside, no less less direct
[11:53] impact to Bitcoin and it really, you
[11:55] know, over the long term will start to
[11:57] trade a little bit, uh, separate from
[11:59] from those uh, performance metrics.
[12:04] So, how do we go about
[12:07] generating more capital for strategy?
[12:11] This is our gear diagram that we we put
[12:14] together recently. And this shows you
[12:16] how we're building the components of the
[12:19] capital structure and how they all work
[12:21] together. Um, you can see here, uh, this
[12:24] this sort of illustrates the flywheel,
[12:28] uh, impact that I've talked about and
[12:30] that we've talked about a lot in terms
[12:31] of how we're deploying capital. You can
[12:33] see here Strike, Strife, and MSTR all
[12:35] have a BTC torque of seven to close to
[12:40] 13. BTC torque just means it's the BTC
[12:44] dollar value that is gained relative to
[12:46] the amount of capital that we've
[12:48] invested. So for us, Strife is a great
[12:50] instrument because it generates more
[12:52] value uh pound-for-pound. Uh but even at
[12:56] 6.9% MSTR is clearly outperforming the
[12:59] market in many ways. Again, these are
[13:02] all available to you and to retail
[13:05] investors as well as institutional
[13:07] investors. I think that's a key
[13:08] differentiation I'd like for you all. If
[13:10] there's one thing you take away, it
[13:12] might be, yeah, we've heard a lot about
[13:13] strategy and, you know, we've listened
[13:15] to two-hour conference, you know,
[13:16] earnings calls, but really what we're
[13:18] offering is for everyone, and it's not
[13:21] just for, you know, the money manager
[13:23] that it's got a trillion dollar, a
[13:24] billion dollars, you know, that they've
[13:26] got to invest. This is for you. This is
[13:27] for me. This is for your grandparents.
[13:29] This is for your your children. Uh this
[13:32] is this is Bitcoin for all. And it sort
[13:34] of, you know, aligns to that ethos.
[13:38] I'm out of time, but I'm going to go
[13:39] over for a minute or two if that's okay,
[13:41] George. Um, so this is our capital
[13:44] structure shown a different way. You can
[13:46] see um sort of seniority at the very
[13:48] top. We have our converts $8 billion
[13:51] roughly. Uh we have strike and strife.
[13:54] Uh we have MSTR and then again as I
[13:56] mentioned before, it's all founded on
[14:00] six this is 62 I think it's closer to
[14:02] 6465 billion dollars of Bitcoin today.
[14:06] So it's all based on a foundation of
[14:08] Bitcoin. All of the instruments that we
[14:10] provide to the market. I think one thing
[14:13] to note here is that Strife and Strife,
[14:15] Strike and Strife are fairly small
[14:18] relative to MSTR and and obviously our
[14:22] BTC huddle. This is an opportunity for
[14:24] us. We believe that because of the
[14:27] performance, because of the way that you
[14:29] can access it, because of the ATMs we
[14:32] put in place now that we can follow on
[14:34] and issue more of these instruments. We
[14:37] have a lot of opportunity here to grow
[14:39] um the dollar amounts here and and we
[14:41] plan to do so.
[14:45] This is our uh capital plan. uh you know
[14:49] we originally launched it in Q3 I guess
[14:52] Q4 of last year as a 21-21 plan we've
[14:56] now upgraded it to a 4242 plan what's
[14:59] amazing about our ability to generate
[15:01] capital is when we introduced the 21-21
[15:05] plan we were like wow that's 42 billion
[15:08] of capital how are we going to possibly
[15:11] do that um we finished the equity
[15:14] portion of that 2120 plan 2121 plan in 6
[15:18] months relative to we thought maybe it
[15:21] would take 3 years. And there's a lot of
[15:23] reasons why. There's a lot of reasons
[15:25] why we're all here at this conference
[15:28] celebrating the momentum that Bitcoin
[15:30] has established over the last six to,
[15:32] you know, 10 months. But that's allowed
[15:34] us to really take advantage of the
[15:36] market opportunities out there. But what
[15:38] you can see at the bottom in the fixed
[15:40] income section of our capital plan is we
[15:44] have a lot more to go. And this goes
[15:46] back to the point I was making earlier.
[15:48] We think there's a lot of opportunity
[15:50] for us to grow Strike and Strife and
[15:52] other preferred equity offerings we plan
[15:54] to put into the market in the future
[15:56] because of the performance, because of
[15:58] the the adoption, because of the yield
[16:01] profile it generates. um you know if you
[16:04] can go find better you know money at 10%
[16:07] uh being in this room of Bitcoiners I I
[16:10] you know with the safety and soundness
[16:11] of a management team and a track record
[16:14] and credibility you know I I'd be
[16:16] hardressed to to find those types of
[16:18] opportunities so that's why we think
[16:19] there's a ton of opportunity um in in
[16:22] rounding out this capital plan will it
[16:24] take two years will it take three years
[16:27] it took us six months so on the last
[16:30] plan so on the equity side So, you know,
[16:33] I'll I'll let you guys think determine
[16:35] whether or not it's going to take 2 or 3
[16:37] years, but we plan to be active.
[16:40] And then, um, my last slide here, um,
[16:43] this just talks about our year-to- date
[16:45] performance on our KPI targets that we
[16:47] put out to the market. We recently
[16:50] increased our target of BTC uh, yield
[16:53] from uh, up to 25%, we're at 17% and
[16:57] this probably is slightly stale relative
[16:58] to the announcement we've made recently.
[17:00] So that's close to 70% complete and here
[17:03] we are in the middle half of the year.
[17:04] So we feel like there's a a good
[17:06] opportunity for us to complete this for
[17:08] the year and probably before the end of
[17:10] the year on the BTC dollar gain. We also
[17:13] increased our target to $15 billion
[17:16] uh for 2025. Uh we're over 50% done
[17:20] there. So all of the the the tools that
[17:22] I described earlier, whether it's the
[17:25] preferred equity offering, whether it's
[17:26] the convertible notes uh complex,
[17:30] whether it's our our issuance of common
[17:32] equity, this all allows us to achieve
[17:34] those results. And so we're very excited
[17:37] to increase our targets, but we're also
[17:39] very optimistic that these are more than
[17:41] achievable. And if our track record is
[17:44] any indication, hopefully you'll see us
[17:47] achieving this sooner than even we
[17:49] think.
[17:51] So with that, thank you for your time. I
[17:54] appreciate everyone's uh energy and uh I
[17:58] look forward to seeing you guys soon.
