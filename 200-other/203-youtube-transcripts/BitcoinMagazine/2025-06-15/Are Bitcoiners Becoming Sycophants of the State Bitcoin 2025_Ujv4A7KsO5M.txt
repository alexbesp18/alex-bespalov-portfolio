[00:00] So, we are here to discuss are
[00:02] Bitcoiners becoming sick of fans of the
[00:04] state. Um, the answer seems clearly yes,
[00:07] but we're going to get into that. Give
[00:09] it away. You can't give it away. Let's
[00:11] start with you, Eric, and I'm really
[00:13] teeing you up here. What do you think of
[00:15] the state?
[00:23] Fuck the state.
[00:26] Look, like the the amount of dick
[00:28] sucking going on towards the political
[00:29] establishment that's going on here is
[00:31] shameful and disgusting. Bitcoin works
[00:34] without the state. We don't need an SPR.
[00:37] You can own Bitcoin today and exit from
[00:39] this fucked up establishment that's
[00:41] designed to steal from you and
[00:43] redistribute that money towards war and
[00:45] horror. If you don't want to have
[00:47] anything to do with it, buy Bitcoin.
[00:49] Hold Bitcoin. Use Bitcoin as your unit
[00:52] of accounting. You do not need the
[00:54] state. And again, I want to really
[00:56] emphasize this for the status in the
[00:57] room. Fuck the state. You cannot have my
[01:00] money and use Bitcoin to defend yourself
[01:03] against the state from taking it. I
[01:05] mean, there is no better way to open
[01:07] this panel. But Bruce, I want to kick it
[01:09] to you because, um, you kind of went
[01:11] inside the belly of the beast. Um, so
[01:13] tell me your perspective on this. Yeah,
[01:15] the same. I mean, the
[01:19] the uh I was going to joke like it's our
[01:21] responsibility we were talking about,
[01:23] but I can't even joke about it because
[01:24] it's so ridiculous and disgusting. The
[01:27] state is a tool of violence. Fiat money
[01:29] is a tool of violence and immoral evil.
[01:33] Every single evil thing you can point to
[01:35] in the world, whether it's global war or
[01:38] for-profit prisons or even obesity, it
[01:41] all tracks back to this stupid invention
[01:44] of the melting ice cube of fiat money.
[01:47] It's time to put it in the dustpin of
[01:48] history. It's immoral. It's wrong. It's
[01:51] violent. It's horrible. None of us
[01:53] should support it. And now we have an
[01:54] alternative to not support it.
[01:57] Let's fucking go. Okay. Am I gonna have
[02:00] anyone on the stage here that's going to
[02:02] disagree with any of this? Oh, I love
[02:03] the state. No, just kidding. I mean, I
[02:06] think I think the uh the title of this
[02:07] or Bitcoiners becoming sick of fans of
[02:09] the state is really interesting because
[02:11] I think a lot of the time Bitcoiners are
[02:13] sick of fans of Bitcoin, right? They
[02:15] don't actually think super hard about
[02:17] it. Bitcoin becomes a sort of religion.
[02:20] And as we get, you know, frankly, more
[02:22] and more normies, we get people who
[02:25] haven't thought really hard about how
[02:27] Bitcoin works and what that means. And
[02:29] also, of course, people who were already
[02:31] sick of fans of the state before
[02:33] becoming Bitcoiners, and now they sort
[02:35] of are able to be sick of fans of both
[02:38] somehow, even though they're these
[02:40] things are in conflict, right? That's
[02:43] actually really interesting. That's like
[02:44] the changing dynamic of who Bitcoiners
[02:47] are. Um, how do you think that's changed
[02:49] in like the last few years? Oh, I mean,
[02:52] enormously. I mean, I remember, you
[02:54] know, back when I initially got into
[02:56] Bitcoin, anybody who was into Bitcoin
[02:59] was weird for like one reason or
[03:02] another, right? They hated the state,
[03:03] they hated the government, they were
[03:04] like weird technical weirdos, you know
[03:06] what I mean? There was something like
[03:08] different. Um, these days, and I I think
[03:10] being into Bitcoin is great. It's
[03:12] awesome. Um I sort of view it as in the
[03:16] early days these people were already a
[03:18] little bit weird. Um these days
[03:20] Bitcoiners a lot of time Bitcoin is kind
[03:23] of getting its hooks into them right and
[03:25] that's maybe the thing that makes me
[03:28] optimistic about the topic of this panel
[03:29] is that uh yes some Bitcoiners are
[03:32] becoming sick of fans of the state and
[03:34] the state has this corrupting power but
[03:37] Bitcoin also has this corrupting power.
[03:39] Bitcoin has incentives. I mean
[03:41] corrupting. I mean corrupting in a good
[03:42] way that it gets its hooks on you. Don't
[03:44] you want to earn some Bitcoin? Don't you
[03:46] want Don't you want to spend some
[03:47] Bitcoin? Don't you want people to accept
[03:48] your Bitcoin? Don't you want the
[03:50] government to enact favorable laws that
[03:52] are favorable to your Bitcoin? So, it's
[03:53] kind of this like mind virus in the same
[03:55] way that the state is a mind virus, but
[03:58] they're at odds with each other and I'm
[04:00] optimistic that Bitcoin will win.
[04:03] So, Huddle, you're not normally the
[04:06] centrist on a panel. I'm in the center
[04:08] of the panel. So, I'll play to that.
[04:11] Yeah, you play centrist because we spoke
[04:12] about this on the podcast yesterday.
[04:14] Yeah. So, here's the thing is like
[04:16] there's a nuance in the term sophan
[04:19] here. Like are bitcoiners sick of fans
[04:20] of the state. I mean maybe some of the
[04:22] dumbest amongst us uh are are going down
[04:24] that that path. But I think that
[04:27] bitcoiners are attempting to use the
[04:29] state for their own benefit. But you
[04:31] know there is no world I mean listen the
[04:33] surveillance ponopticon has already been
[04:35] built. Um whether you like it or not, it
[04:37] exists and there is no place on earth
[04:39] that you can hide from the state. Okay?
[04:42] You can't go into the mountains with
[04:43] your cold card. That's fucking retarded.
[04:45] You have to go through the state. And I
[04:48] think Bitcoiners make this cardinal sin
[04:50] of thinking that uh they are their
[04:52] Bitcoin. It's like, yeah, your Bitcoin
[04:54] is immutable. You are a meat puppet who
[04:56] lives on government land and at any time
[04:58] they want the US government can come
[05:00] into your home and kill you in your
[05:02] living room in front of your children.
[05:04] So, never forget that fact because
[05:06] that's the reality of your situation.
[05:07] And when somebody has a gun to your
[05:09] head, it behooves you to take them
[05:11] seriously.
[05:13] I think that was a really balanced
[05:14] centrist take we just got there. There
[05:16] you go. Here's the centrist. Um, but in
[05:18] this like when I got into Bitcoin,
[05:20] everyone talked about Bitcoin as freedom
[05:22] money and I think that is slowly
[05:24] changing and maybe that change is like
[05:26] accelerated at least among some people.
[05:28] So like do you think we'll lose Bitcoin
[05:30] as freedom money by moving into the
[05:33] state? That that's certainly the big
[05:35] risk, right? is that the there's a world
[05:37] in which Bitcoin gets ghettoized as a
[05:40] store of value where basically Bitcoin
[05:42] is uh owned and controlled and co-opted
[05:44] by the powers that be and it becomes
[05:46] like gold and it's something that's very
[05:48] safe and amendable to the current power
[05:50] structure and it allows the current
[05:52] regime to stay in power and they use it
[05:55] as a you know sort of a a way to
[05:58] maintain their position in the world
[06:00] right and so I think that we as
[06:03] Bitcoiners need to fight the good fight
[06:05] all the way through and make sure that
[06:06] the censorship resistant properties
[06:08] don't get stripped in service of number
[06:10] go up. Even though we are all aligned on
[06:12] number go up and we want number go up
[06:14] because it makes our lives more
[06:15] prosperous. But if we get to the end of
[06:17] the rainbow without freedom, we actually
[06:19] gained literally nothing.
[06:22] And Bruce, I'm interested in your
[06:24] perspective of this as someone who's
[06:25] like tried their hand at politics and
[06:27] you've been in this um kind of
[06:29] apparatus. Like what did you learn from
[06:31] that?
[06:33] the uh well the my experience in
[06:36] politics I ran for office and it's uh
[06:38] you know one disappointing thing is that
[06:39] you know ideas don't matter it's all
[06:41] just money um you know politic we live
[06:44] in a a state worshipping society and you
[06:47] hear people even at events like this
[06:49] like oh boy the under secretary of this
[06:51] and the this elected official is here or
[06:53] there who cares do you run a node you
[06:56] know somebody somebody asked me uh for
[06:58] the round table they said oh do you have
[07:00] a special deal for government officials
[07:02] I said Yeah, double price. You know, the
[07:05] the we shouldn't we should not be giving
[07:07] these people our energy. We're
[07:09] empowering them. They need us more than
[07:11] we need them. We should ignore them. We
[07:13] should refuse meetings with them. We do
[07:15] not need these people. They are violent
[07:17] extremists. We're not the crazy ones.
[07:19] They're the crazy ones. They're the
[07:20] crazy ones who sit in these fancy
[07:22] offices paid for with money they stole
[07:24] from us and claim the right to shoot us
[07:26] or whatever. They don't they don't have
[07:28] any power over us. We've invented nerd
[07:30] money that they can't stop with all
[07:32] their tanks and all their violence and
[07:34] we should tell them to, you know,
[07:36] there's the door and we should be the
[07:38] the the strong front for that and go
[07:40] back to the way that this space used to
[07:42] be, you know, 10 years ago where it was
[07:45] just unthinkable that these people would
[07:47] be welcomed into any of our meetings.
[07:49] You know, we we don't need them. We
[07:50] we've made a better system
[07:53] precisely to, you know, make them, you
[07:56] know, not relevant anymore. So, we got
[07:59] to stop giving them any any air time at
[08:01] all and stop acting like they're
[08:02] important. It's just a bunch of violent
[08:04] thugs in stupid costumes claiming
[08:06] authority over us. Fuck yeah. Here. Um,
[08:11] but then what do you think we should do?
[08:13] Like, are we meant to just completely
[08:15] ignore that this is reality or or should
[08:17] we be trying to push Bitcoiners into
[08:19] politics? I I I'd like to ignore it. You
[08:21] know, I was saying early on, remember
[08:23] Ben Loski, early people in the, you
[08:25] know, remember the, you know, before
[08:27] Gendler, you had this Ben Loski and
[08:29] people were like, "Oh, let's reach out
[08:30] to him." And I saved them all. I didn't
[08:32] want to embarrass too many people, but
[08:34] the who's who of the industry at the
[08:35] time were like, "Oh, great. We're
[08:37] getting clarity. We're reaching out to
[08:38] Benoski." No, screw this guy. He's a
[08:41] horrible guy. He invented the bit
[08:43] license, which was the predecessor to
[08:44] all these stupid regulations. We should
[08:46] have never ever ever met with him. Never
[08:48] given him the time a day. say screw you.
[08:51] Get out of our face. You got one tool
[08:53] and only one tool. That's your thuggish
[08:56] use of guns and force. And if you want
[08:58] to come after us with your guns and your
[09:00] force because we're using math, bring it
[09:02] on. Otherwise, there's the door. I'd
[09:05] love to have someone more fired up than
[09:07] Eric Kase on the panel. This is fucking
[09:08] great. God damn. Yeah. Like, thanks,
[09:10] Bruce. I fucking love you, man. But like
[09:13] look like on on that note like I feel
[09:15] very seriously like look at how fucking
[09:18] powerful Bitcoiners have become as a
[09:20] political contingency. We literally
[09:22] swung the last presidential election.
[09:24] You have a number of people from the
[09:26] administration coming here to pander us.
[09:29] Guys, get off your fucking knees. It is
[09:31] time to stand up and become our own
[09:33] political contingency. We need an Orange
[09:36] party that is about radical moder.
[09:39] Things are fucked up. There is nobody
[09:43] that we can elect that will get us out
[09:45] of the problems that we have made. And
[09:48] that's why we need a totally radical new
[09:50] solution. And Bitcoiners are the only
[09:53] people that have any thoughtful way to
[09:55] address it in any meaningful capacity.
[09:58] So instead of electing red or blue, it's
[10:01] time to elect people that are orange who
[10:03] say, "I'm not going to compromise myself
[10:06] with either the red side or the blue
[10:07] side because they're both just as
[10:09] criminal as the last administration."
[10:11] It's time to do something new, something
[10:13] radical, and something profound. And
[10:15] that's going to be the Orange Party.
[10:18] That's interesting to hear you say
[10:19] because I wouldn't have assumed you
[10:20] would want to put Bitcoiners into
[10:22] politics. So like what does the Orange
[10:24] They don't want politics. It's the
[10:26] emergency of what is happening right now
[10:29] that if we don't solve this, we are
[10:31] going to be fucked. The dollar will be
[10:34] worthless. We will live inside of a
[10:35] technological panopticon where you are
[10:37] surveiled every single moment of every
[10:40] single day and you'll have no idea
[10:42] whether or not that's being used against
[10:43] you. And it is an extreme danger that we
[10:46] all have to be aware of with central
[10:47] bank digital currencies. So I implore
[10:50] you, take very seriously the revolution
[10:53] that Bitcoin can implement, but it needs
[10:56] to be pushed forward by a grassroots
[10:58] level and a radical new political ideal
[11:01] that is about not choosing red or blue,
[11:04] not choosing the lowest common
[11:05] denominator and deciding to do something
[11:07] different.
[11:09] So Hodle Bitcoiners like to talk about
[11:11] the Trojan horse. Do you think the
[11:13] Orange Party might be in the Trojan
[11:15] horse in government now?
[11:17] Yeah, I mean, if you want to say
[11:19] there's, you know, there's a couple
[11:20] different outcomes here. One is that you
[11:22] fight the state straight up. Um, a lot
[11:24] of Bitcoiners spent a lot of time
[11:26] thinking that was the inevitable outcome
[11:28] and that you would have to martyr
[11:29] yourself against the state in order to
[11:31] win and see Bitcoin succeed. Uh, I I
[11:33] don't think that's the the path that
[11:35] we're on. I think we are more on the
[11:36] Trojan horse horse path and you can see
[11:38] that Bitcoin is being um adopted by the
[11:41] state and they're doing that because our
[11:43] power is rising and their power is
[11:44] waning and they're doing it to maintain
[11:46] control. It's the same way like the
[11:48] Roman state became the Holy Roman Empire
[11:51] um you know when they subsumed
[11:52] Christianity for their own benefit right
[11:54] so like these patterns repeat over time
[11:57] and I think that we are in a type of
[11:59] Trojan horse because the only way out is
[12:01] through in my opinion and uh you know I
[12:03] agree with Eric like we should have our
[12:04] own party and we shouldn't be beholden
[12:06] to this bipartisan like bullshit which
[12:08] is just you know you you in America you
[12:10] can change parties but you can never
[12:12] change policies like we get the same
[12:13] horrible fucking policies every single
[12:15] time no matter who's in office. And so
[12:18] if we did have something like an orange
[12:19] party, I think it would be fantastic. Um
[12:22] I think one thing Bitcoiners need to
[12:23] learn about being inside a Trojan horse
[12:26] is that sometimes it's good to shut the
[12:27] fuck up when you're in the Trojan horse.
[12:29] We're not doing a very good job of that
[12:31] right now. No. No. Yeah. I actually
[12:33] think that the the Trojan horse analogy
[12:35] is is a good one. And there's a lot of
[12:38] opportunities, I believe, to actually
[12:41] capture the state and capture state
[12:43] actors with the incentives of Bitcoin.
[12:45] So, if I was a political person, which
[12:48] honestly I'm not because it just is
[12:50] gross and it takes time and it takes
[12:51] energy and it's stressful, but I would
[12:53] be looking at ways to capture government
[12:57] government entities, figure out how to
[12:59] get them to use Bitcoin in a way that
[13:01] would align their incentives with
[13:03] Bitcoin. I don't know if I would give
[13:06] politicians money because that seems
[13:09] like a pretty fraught path. But if I
[13:11] did, I would want to give them Bitcoin
[13:12] and sort of force them to hold Bitcoin
[13:15] for longer periods of time. Like the
[13:17] same way that power corrupts, money can
[13:20] corrupt. And maybe we can use that to
[13:22] our own ends to even not in direct
[13:25] opposition to the state, just slowly
[13:28] capture all the individuals. And then we
[13:30] wake up one day and they're all like,
[13:31] "Yeah, I hold Bitcoin and I use Bitcoin.
[13:33] Like, why would I vote why would I ever
[13:35] vote against it?"
[13:37] I think maybe we should take a step
[13:38] back. Casey, this one's for you. I want
[13:40] to know like what's at stake here? How
[13:42] can Bitcoin be captured by the state?
[13:44] Oh, I mean I think I think we're
[13:46] entering an incredibly weird period. Um
[13:49] I've always thought this that there
[13:50] would come a period where the where
[13:53] Bitcoin becomes uh relevant in a
[13:55] geopolitical way. It gets large enough
[13:57] that it actually, you know, people who
[14:00] are in power uh entities, agencies,
[14:03] people start to take notice of Bitcoin.
[14:06] Um, I always knew that was coming and I
[14:09] think that we're entering a tremendously
[14:12] like powerful but also very risky
[14:14] period. Um, I sort of liken it to the
[14:16] war on drugs. Like the the war on drugs
[14:18] in America was not successful but it did
[14:21] make it very very unpleasant to like be
[14:25] a drug user to get to get drugs uh etc
[14:28] etc etc. So even though I think
[14:30] ultimately the government can't destroy
[14:32] Bitcoin, I think that the government
[14:34] could make it very very very unpleasant
[14:36] to be a Bitcoiner. Um and if there was
[14:39] sort of a global, you know, if the uh
[14:42] heads of state all over the world and
[14:44] agencies all over the world realized
[14:46] what a threat Bitcoin was to their power
[14:49] and for once acted in a globally
[14:52] globally coordinated way, they could
[14:54] make it very unpleasant to be a
[14:55] Bitcoiner. They could drive Bitcoin
[14:56] underground. they could make it illegal
[14:58] to hold to transfer. Um, and I think
[15:01] that Bitcoin has the that might not
[15:03] happen because they're often irrational
[15:05] and they don't act in a coordinated way.
[15:07] Um, and Bitcoin does have a good chance
[15:10] of resisting that. But I think that a
[15:12] lot of people underestimate how
[15:13] unpleasant the government could make it
[15:15] and they assume that Bitcoin will win.
[15:18] It's a fate fate accomply when in fact
[15:20] it isn't, right? We we need to face
[15:23] those challenges as they occur and I
[15:26] think they could be quite nasty. I mean
[15:28] after all the the government they are
[15:29] the ones with the money printer and the
[15:32] guns and the thugs and we should take
[15:35] that quite seriously. Eric, you gave me
[15:38] a sliced smile there. Is there something
[15:39] you wanted to add to that? I I just I
[15:42] totally agree with Casey and I think we
[15:44] are entering into a very dangerous
[15:46] period and I think people need to be
[15:47] very thoughtful about the exact way that
[15:50] we're going to approach this and like
[15:52] that's why I'm a fan of this idea of the
[15:54] Orange Party because I I do think all of
[15:55] this politicizes at some point and I
[15:57] think an Orange Party is the only way
[15:59] that it maintains a radical truly third
[16:03] party political ideal. And I think as
[16:05] much as it integrates with one of the
[16:07] two parties, it becomes something pretty
[16:09] dangerous. And furthermore, like
[16:11] captured KYC Bitcoin that needs rails to
[16:14] be able to operate on the traditional
[16:17] AML KYC financial system. Like that's
[16:20] not Bitcoin. That's this weird
[16:22] amalgamated thing that's designed to
[16:24] destroy the components of Bitcoin. And
[16:26] the great news is is that like Bitcoin
[16:29] totally operates right now as it can
[16:32] without that system needing to be in
[16:34] place. So, like we're we're in a good
[16:36] standing, but people need to understand
[16:38] the difference between Bitcoin on
[16:40] Coinbase and Bitcoin that they keep in
[16:42] their own private wallet. So, just to
[16:45] play devil's advocate for a minute, um,
[16:46] incentives matter. And so, is there not
[16:49] an argument that we should absolutely
[16:50] speedrun like the strategic Bitcoin
[16:52] reserve and these other things that are
[16:54] being pushed? Um, does that not make our
[16:56] incentives align with them? And maybe
[16:58] Hodddle, you can take this one. Uh, I
[17:01] mean, yeah, listen, it makes our
[17:02] incentives more aligned with them.
[17:04] Again, I think you can't you you and
[17:06] your Bitcoin are different. Like Casey
[17:09] said, they can make your life absolute
[17:11] hell. Um I think there is a big
[17:13] difference. Like listen, there's a big
[17:14] difference between the Trump
[17:15] administration and the Camala Harris
[17:16] administration. Completely different for
[17:18] the next four years for our life. Now,
[17:20] like maybe like the big game theory here
[17:22] doesn't doesn't change or swing on every
[17:24] election, but certainly like there are
[17:27] paths forward that are much worse for
[17:30] us. And as Bitcoiners, like there are
[17:32] levels of survival we're prepared to
[17:34] endure, but like I don't necessarily
[17:36] want to endure those levels of survival,
[17:38] you know? So, I think it's a it's a
[17:40] tight rope bag to make sure that you
[17:41] don't lose your soul on the way to, you
[17:44] know, endless riches and other things.
[17:47] I I actually just to add I do think that
[17:50] Bitcoin reserves by states are probably
[17:54] good in the long run. Uh because I do
[17:56] think we want Bitcoin to monetize. We
[17:59] want Bitcoin to become not just an
[18:01] option on on a store of value, but a
[18:03] store of value itself. And a lot of that
[18:05] just means increased liquidity, uh
[18:09] increased like long-term holding of
[18:11] Bitcoin. So, I certainly don't like the
[18:13] idea of governments getting rich on
[18:16] Bitcoin like entirely, but I do think
[18:18] it's probably mostly a good thing,
[18:20] right? It does get Bitcoin to that like
[18:22] next level of like geopolitical
[18:24] importance, like very seriously. This is
[18:26] a reserve asset. I mean, it'd be great
[18:29] if the banks were like, "Oh, no. We
[18:31] can't we can't do anything to hurt the
[18:32] value of Bitcoin because then like we're
[18:34] fucked ex balance of trade, blah blah
[18:36] blah blah blah."
[18:37] Well, and this is an interesting
[18:38] position I have is like I I think like
[18:41] United States like California and New
[18:43] Hampshire and like regional governments
[18:45] should hold Bitcoin. Federal governments
[18:47] absolutely not. And I actually think
[18:49] like this is one of the key
[18:50] counterpowers that regional and local
[18:53] governments can use against federal
[18:54] entities to like get them under control.
[18:57] And so like I'm a huge proponent of
[18:59] state and autonomous rights for things
[19:02] that are under federal administration.
[19:04] And I think that's where Bitcoin could
[19:05] do the most powerful stuff. But
[19:06] Bitcoin's money for enemies. Like who
[19:08] who's to say we should try and stop the
[19:10] state from doing this? Well, we
[19:12] literally can't stop the state from
[19:13] doing this. I mean, we we can't even
[19:14] stop people from putting ordinals on
[19:16] chain. No offense, Casey. No,
[19:20] but no, no. I mean, we we have no
[19:22] ability to stop people from using an
[19:24] open permissionless network in whichever
[19:25] way they want to use an open
[19:26] permissionless network, right? So like
[19:28] there is no it's it's it's a bit of
[19:30] self-importance for us to sit here and
[19:32] be like should we allow the state to do
[19:34] this? You know, they're going to do it
[19:36] no matter what. So I mean that that is
[19:39] true, but at the same time, do we not
[19:41] have like a moral impetus to at least
[19:43] stand up and have these conversations?
[19:45] Absolutely. I I actually just that's the
[19:48] first time I've heard the idea that we
[19:49] should get the local governments and the
[19:51] states to adopt Bitcoin, but not the
[19:53] federal government. I think that's a
[19:54] fucking phenomenal idea. I fucking love
[19:56] that. And maybe that is actually
[19:57] something that could guide our strategy
[20:00] which is like okay you know there are
[20:02] large powers and there small powers and
[20:04] we think the large powers are generally
[20:06] you know by and large worse scarier
[20:09] right so how can we strategically use
[20:12] bitcoin to as money for enemy enemies
[20:15] incentivize and make more powerful these
[20:18] small actors in a strategic way right so
[20:22] that they can then create a little bit
[20:23] more competition for government a little
[20:25] bit more
[20:26] distribution of power, right? We might
[20:28] like to, you know, tear down the state
[20:30] and the federal government, but if we're
[20:32] thinking about which one we like and how
[20:33] do we feel about it, I think most
[20:35] people, most Bitcoiners would be like,
[20:36] "Yeah, we'd probably like the state to
[20:37] have more power and the federal
[20:38] government to have way less power." So,
[20:40] I think that's a fabulous strategy.
[20:42] So, I I I'm I'm all in on the fuck the
[20:46] state idea, but Bruce, I've got a
[20:47] question for you, which is like
[20:49] obviously we've gone from the uh Biden
[20:50] administration, which was very anti-
[20:52] Bitcoin, to a Trump administration that
[20:54] is at least like seemingly pro Bitcoin.
[20:56] Um they're allowing businesses to like
[20:58] thrive in the US. Is that not a step
[21:00] forward? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a
[21:03] step forward. It's good. I think the
[21:06] difference with being like a psychopant
[21:07] is is, you know, this worshipping of the
[21:10] state. I view the state as like any
[21:12] other no coiner, you know, like your
[21:13] your your your friend on Facebook who's
[21:16] like, "Ah, I should have listened to you
[21:17] 10 years ago. Maybe in 2035 I will." You
[21:20] know, it's like, "All right, if they buy
[21:21] it, great. If they don't, they don't."
[21:23] You know, I mean to Huttle's point, it's
[21:25] like um you know, certainly there is a
[21:29] difference between you know, this
[21:31] cackling commie Camala who would have,
[21:33] you know, wanted everybody in this room
[21:35] locked up in a cage if she had her way
[21:38] versus Trump who is more more pro-
[21:40] freedom. And uh you know, that's a big
[21:43] difference. We don't want to necessarily
[21:44] fight these fights. But it's also not
[21:46] our you know, we can do our own thing.
[21:48] We've invented better money. And you
[21:50] know if somebody wants to use Zimbabwe
[21:52] money or they want to use gold uh you
[21:54] know whatever like that's their
[21:56] business. We we've made bet our better
[21:58] money we can keep going down our own
[21:59] path using better money and be free of
[22:02] all the tyrant money and everything bad
[22:03] that comes with it. So one of the things
[22:06] I'm most nervous about for this panel is
[22:08] the fact that we have plenty of
[22:10] politicians here in the room and I don't
[22:11] want to give them ideas but um Eric
[22:14] maybe we'll start with you. I'd like a
[22:15] few of your opinion on this but like
[22:17] we've had David Saxs here. I don't know
[22:18] if he's been on stage yet. Um JD Vance
[22:20] was on stage this morning. Like what
[22:22] would your message to these people be?
[22:26] Uh you could just not do the things
[22:29] you're doing, you know, like like what
[22:31] you're doing is actually immoral and
[22:33] bad. Like you you hurt people. You like
[22:36] actively want to use the state to
[22:38] implement violence against others.
[22:41] That's like fucked up and wrong. Like if
[22:43] you if you like personally want to like
[22:45] go to Yemen and like try to stab those
[22:47] people that like that's on you. But like
[22:49] asking other people to go do that, it's
[22:51] just like a fucked up and terrible
[22:52] thing. And like why do you want to like
[22:55] look at all my personal pictures and
[22:56] stuff with like these emergency acts?
[22:59] And also just like fuck you. You're not
[23:02] like a king, you know? Like like you're
[23:04] supposed to be liable to the law too.
[23:07] And like I don't appreciate you trying
[23:09] to think that that you just get to kind
[23:11] of advance the state however the fuck
[23:13] you want because you have power. So uh I
[23:16] guess my message is like fuck you and
[23:18] leave me alone.
[23:20] Bruce, I've got to go to you there. I
[23:21] want your message too. My message to the
[23:24] politicians would be the same thing that
[23:27] I said to my little kids when they were
[23:29] five years old, which is, you know,
[23:31] don't hurt people. It's not moral to
[23:33] hurt people unless it's in defense or
[23:35] they hurt you. Duh. Like that's it. And
[23:39] all your bullshit goes out the window if
[23:41] you follow that simple rule. All your
[23:43] AML KYC, all your stupid forms, all your
[23:47] idea of putting people in cages over
[23:48] victimless crimes, it's out the window
[23:50] if you follow the simple thing that any
[23:53] five-year-old should know, which is that
[23:54] you don't have a moral right to point a
[23:56] gun in somebody's face. You don't have a
[23:58] right to steal somebody's money, to hire
[24:00] somebody else to point a gun in
[24:01] somebody's face because you have some
[24:03] invisible, you know, uh, social contract
[24:07] that nobody's ever seen and nobody's
[24:08] ever signed. Screw you. Get out of our
[24:11] business. Leave us alone. And, uh, be
[24:13] peaceful. Just be be cool. Be cool. Te,
[24:16] you know, do things that you teach a
[24:17] little kid to do. And you'll find
[24:19] yourself a lot more moral. And you'll
[24:20] find yourself that 99% of these laws are
[24:23] not moral. They have no place in a
[24:25] civilized society. And we've got to
[24:27] remember that these people don't have a
[24:29] right to lecture us. They are the
[24:31] violent thugs who killed, you know,
[24:33] hundreds of millions of people over the
[24:35] last century. They have nothing on us.
[24:37] All we want to do is run some code and
[24:38] trade around our nerd money. Leave us
[24:40] alone.
[24:42] Fuck yeah. Let's go. Um, hold on. When
[24:45] we were talking about this uh on the
[24:47] podcast yesterday, you obviously had a
[24:49] slightly different opinion. Um, where do
[24:52] you think Bitcoin is going to fall in
[24:53] this? Like do you think these people are
[24:54] just here panning drizzle? Do you think
[24:56] they are truly starting to like open
[24:57] their eyes to Bitcoin and understand
[24:59] what this thing is? You know, personally
[25:01] like I I don't really care what they
[25:03] think. They are employees who work for
[25:06] us. So their thoughts and opinions on
[25:09] the matter are irrelevant. Do what the
[25:11] fuck we tell you to do. I don't work for
[25:13] you. I'm not underneath you. You're
[25:15] underneath me. You know what I mean? So
[25:16] it's like the state is a weapon. It's
[25:19] for sale. And Bitcoiners are the highest
[25:21] biders.
[25:23] Period. Let's fucking go. All right,
[25:25] Casey, close out. Let's tell us tell
[25:28] everyone here why Bitcoin wins
[25:30] regardless of what happens. Oh, man. I
[25:32] don't know if Bitcoin wins regardless of
[25:33] what happens. I think that depends on
[25:35] the future. I think that depends of on
[25:37] what bit Bitcoiners do, how the state
[25:40] organizes, um what the response is. I
[25:43] mean, if we all of a sudden saw a um
[25:47] very rapid inflation in a lot of fiat
[25:50] currencies and there was a plausible
[25:53] scapegoat in Bitcoin, you know, all over
[25:55] the world and they were able to make a
[25:58] sort of, you know, this marketing claim
[26:00] that Bitcoin is causing this, right?
[26:03] Bitcoin is making your savings go to
[26:05] zero. It's causing this carnage in the
[26:07] economy. If that happened worldwide, I I
[26:10] think that's I think that's really
[26:11] scary. Um, I take that seriously. You
[26:13] know, I don't I don't know that Bitcoin
[26:15] will succeed. I think Bitcoin has is
[26:17] incredibly strong. It's incredibly
[26:20] difficult to fuck up. But in that case,
[26:22] like, man, I don't know. Uh, especially
[26:24] with uh you can just DDoS core
[26:27] developers by spinning up LLMs and
[26:29] making like dumbass arguments on GitHub.
[26:32] So, I don't know if Bitcoin succeeds,
[26:35] it's going to be because of people and
[26:37] it's going to be because of how we react
[26:40] to the challenges of the future. Well, I
[26:42] don't think there's a better way to end
[26:44] this panel. Thank you to all the
[26:45] panelists. Give him a big round of
[26:46] applause. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks,
[26:48] guys.
