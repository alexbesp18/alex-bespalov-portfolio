[00:00] Alrighty. Well, you know, we're all here
[00:02] for a lot of many reasons. Um, number go
[00:05] up is always fun. Seeing all our friends
[00:06] is another. Uh, but to kick off the
[00:09] mining stage here in Vegas, I'm really
[00:12] excited to talk about revitalizing our
[00:14] rural communities. And I don't think
[00:16] there could be two uh leaders in our
[00:18] industry that could really really
[00:20] represent those examples than the
[00:21] gentlemen that we have here on stage.
[00:23] And so while I see a many familiar faces
[00:26] here, a lot of industry colleagues, I
[00:28] hope I see some people that maybe are
[00:29] new to the industry and what they can
[00:31] take away from this conversation is how
[00:34] Bitcoin mining really connects to, you
[00:36] know, the the America that their uncle
[00:38] lives in or that their cousins live in,
[00:40] right? So that's really what this
[00:41] conversation is about. My name is Mara
[00:43] Gutierrez. I work with Giga Energy. I'm
[00:45] their cat herder. Do all the business
[00:47] development across electrical
[00:48] infrastructure. And really excited to be
[00:50] here with Russ and Matt. I'll let them
[00:52] introduce themselves and their companies
[00:54] and then we'll dive right into it.
[00:56] Gentlemen,
[00:58] hi guys. I'm uh Russell K. I'm the chief
[01:00] development officer at Core Scientific
[01:02] and I've been at Core from the
[01:03] beginning. Uh Core operates sites in
[01:06] North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky,
[01:09] Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. Uh we
[01:12] do a bit of Bitcoin mining. Have been
[01:14] doing that for a while. And then we also
[01:15] have um a lot of AI and HBC data centers
[01:18] in some of those states as well. and I'm
[01:20] excited to talk about this one, Matt,
[01:21] and talk about some of the real
[01:22] revitalization that's happened at some
[01:23] of our sites around the country. Thank
[01:25] you. Um my name is Matt Schultz. I'm the
[01:28] uh executive chairman and co-founder at
[01:30] CleanSpark. Um we're the largest hash
[01:34] rate provider in North America in the
[01:36] United States and the second largest
[01:38] publicly traded Bitcoin mining company
[01:40] overall. Uh we operate 32 data centers
[01:43] in Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, and
[01:45] most recently Wyoming. uh and we've uh
[01:49] given some guidance to achieve about 50
[01:51] xahash of processing power by this uh
[01:54] this summer. So excited to be here.
[01:56] Looking forward to the chat. Excellent.
[01:58] No, thank you gentlemen. So, as you've
[02:00] heard some of those states, those are
[02:02] states that maybe are, you know, might
[02:04] have flown over to get here, right? Um
[02:06] that, you know, you might associate with
[02:08] energy production, whether that's wind,
[02:10] solar, oil, and gas. And um and that's
[02:13] where, you know, we are building the
[02:15] hash rate here in the United States. Um,
[02:17] you know, to really kind of kick off
[02:18] this conversation, we're going to really
[02:20] explore how mining enters these
[02:22] communities. We're going to explore how
[02:24] we're working with them, how everybody
[02:26] can really benefit, and then we'll look
[02:27] out to the future after. Um, now Russ, I
[02:31] I'll kick off the conversation with you
[02:33] and we can pass it around to Matt as
[02:34] well. When uh what does that first board
[02:37] meeting look like when you mention the
[02:40] word Bitcoin to um you know, a community
[02:42] board meeting?
[02:44] So, interesting enough, it's it's very
[02:46] different now. Uh, in 2017, I want to
[02:48] specifically talk about like our Marble
[02:50] data center, which is our first large
[02:52] scale data center. In 2017, when we
[02:54] bought that property, no one even knew
[02:56] what it was, which is probably a good
[02:57] thing because we were able to actually
[02:59] get in there and and build rapport with
[03:01] the community and get open. Uh, when,
[03:04] you know, China closed down Bitcoin
[03:06] mining, there's a big rush of Bitcoin
[03:07] mining in the States. I think it got a
[03:09] lot harder because uh unlike with
[03:11] CleanSpark and with Core Scientific, we
[03:13] have worked
[03:15] diligently to be good community
[03:17] partners. There was some that had not.
[03:18] So that really changed the the
[03:20] conversations. So now when we go into a
[03:22] community and talk about Bitcoin mining,
[03:24] you you have to you have to go in there
[03:26] and and talk about the negatives. That's
[03:28] that's the kind of questions you get
[03:29] because people think about only the
[03:30] negatives. Interesting enough though, if
[03:32] you go to any of our communities where
[03:33] we operate now and we want expanded
[03:35] power to expand, we've worked so hard to
[03:38] develop good relationships with the
[03:40] communities that they offer they offer
[03:41] us additional power, they offer
[03:42] additional expansion opportunities. So,
[03:44] you know, the town councils that really
[03:45] make a lot of these decisions uh the the
[03:48] loud uh citizens uh they can really make
[03:51] a difference. In Cherokee County and
[03:52] North Carolina, there was another minor
[03:54] down the road that was really um keep
[03:57] saying really, they had a lot of noise
[03:58] pollution and we did not. and it's hard
[04:01] not to get lumped into the same bucket.
[04:04] But interesting enough, that little town
[04:05] because we had been there so long was
[04:07] able to distinguish between our
[04:08] operations and those other operations.
[04:10] So, I like to say it's it's changed over
[04:12] the years, but it's it's a conversation
[04:13] you have to have because there's a lot
[04:14] of negative connotations that come with
[04:16] Bitcoin mining, at least in states right
[04:17] now. Sure. Yeah. I So, CleanSpark has
[04:21] always had the philosophy that we have a
[04:24] front door approach. Um, a lot of
[04:26] Bitcoin mining companies have a bit of a
[04:29] negative reputation because um, oftent
[04:32] times utility contracts and agreements
[04:35] are negotiated behind closed doors. And
[04:38] we we've taken a a completely different
[04:40] approach. And our our kind of our
[04:43] methodology is that there are many of
[04:46] these small communities that when the
[04:49] utility grid was laid out four, five,
[04:51] six decades ago, they had industrial
[04:54] opportunities there. there was mining,
[04:55] there was manufacturing and and as we
[04:58] know a lot of that industry in our
[04:59] country has been offshored. So we look
[05:02] at these small towns much the same as um
[05:05] like Radiator Springs on the movie Cars,
[05:08] right? The freeway comes by and the town
[05:10] gets forgotten. Well, it's much the same
[05:12] in a lot of these communities that when
[05:14] they laid out the grid, they had pockets
[05:16] of power available um and and then the
[05:19] industry didn't consume them. So we
[05:21] become really the ideal partner for
[05:23] these communities. In most instances, we
[05:27] negotiate a a a fee that we buy power
[05:30] from the city who is our utility. We pay
[05:33] their cost and we allow them to make a
[05:35] margin on that cost. So now the cities
[05:37] are deriving revenue from otherwise
[05:39] stranded assets.
[05:41] That starts to build up when you go
[05:43] from, you know, 1 megawatt to 200
[05:46] megawatts. Now it's meaningful. And in a
[05:49] lot of the places we do business, the
[05:51] sales tax stays in those communities
[05:54] where it's generated. So, not only are
[05:57] we allowing these cities to buy power
[05:59] under the Costco model, they're they're
[06:01] buying more energy, so it drives the
[06:03] price down, but on top of that, the the
[06:06] revenues generated from that and then
[06:07] the sales tax stay in the communities
[06:10] and improve the infrastructure. So, bike
[06:13] paths and walking trails and splash
[06:15] pads. And you know, last quick point,
[06:18] one one of the little communities that
[06:19] we do business in, the the sales tax
[06:23] generated on our power bill created such
[06:26] a surplus that they had to find other
[06:29] places to allocate that. So they
[06:31] allocated it to property taxes in the
[06:34] community. So when you think about
[06:36] Bitcoin mining and a negative impact,
[06:38] we're we go into these communities, we
[06:40] lower the energy price, we employ a ton
[06:42] of people, we educate the workforce, we
[06:45] improve the community, and now we're
[06:46] actually pushing down property taxes in
[06:49] those jurisdictions. So we don't have a
[06:51] bunch of guys out looking for megawws.
[06:53] Ours is the inverse. We get a lot of
[06:55] inbound inquiries saying, "Hey, what do
[06:58] I have to do to get you to send Scott
[06:59] over here and build one of those in my
[07:01] town?" Yeah. I'll add and he made such a
[07:04] good point. Three of our our largest
[07:06] sites, one in North Carolina, one in
[07:08] Dalton, Georgia, one in Denton, Texas.
[07:10] The the power utility company there is a
[07:12] local co-op. So, their generation comes
[07:13] from Southern Company or it comes from
[07:15] TVA or it comes in the case of Texas.
[07:16] It's just on the Urkott grid, but we
[07:18] actually pay a override fee to that
[07:21] local co-op. And it's amazing how much
[07:23] of the budget we are like in the town of
[07:25] in Cherokee County. You can drive around
[07:27] the community and it's a co-op. So, one,
[07:28] so it's co-op. I live in a co-op. I
[07:30] don't know if anybody else does, but you
[07:31] get a check every couple years because
[07:33] if there's any leftover monies in the
[07:34] co-op, it goes back to you because so
[07:35] because the owners are the are the town
[07:37] citizens themselves. So the co-op folks
[07:39] in Cherokee County get a rebate in
[07:42] Dalton where the the town actually owns
[07:44] the utility. So uh I think we have a
[07:47] little over 400 megawatts there now.
[07:48] Like that's a huge piece of that budget
[07:50] for that town. And in Denton, Texas, uh
[07:53] is the same situation he just talked
[07:54] about. You know, we started out uh two
[07:56] or 30 hund megawatts there. We're now up
[07:57] over 400 megawatts there. And we're a
[07:59] we're a third or a quart somewhere
[08:01] between a third and a quarter of the
[08:03] entire town budget. And it it's a huge
[08:05] it's a huge difference for these little
[08:07] towns. Uh and and as Matt said, what it
[08:09] means is in each of those towns, at
[08:10] least in all three of those actually, we
[08:12] actually increase capacity with nothing
[08:15] more than a conversation. And and we
[08:17] like going back to the same same place
[08:18] because we already have infrastructure
[08:19] there. We already have clients there.
[08:21] Excuse me. We already have staff there.
[08:23] in these towns when they see the
[08:24] positive impact on their uh budgets and
[08:27] they see the positive impact on their
[08:28] infrastructure. Like in the co-ops, they
[08:30] actually are putting in new transmission
[08:31] line, putting in new substations,
[08:32] putting in new transformers, all that
[08:34] stuff makes their whole grid more
[08:35] efficient. They actually like us there.
[08:37] They really do. It's amazing opportunity
[08:39] for us to expand our business because of
[08:41] that. No, no, no. I I appreciate that,
[08:43] gentlemen. And we'll we'll pin the
[08:44] utility part of this conversation. We'll
[08:46] come back around there. Always, I'm
[08:48] sure, very curious for the audience. Um,
[08:50] I'd love to really like double click
[08:51] into um the the human and the the the
[08:54] people side of this um here. You know, I
[08:57] you know, I come from an oil and gas
[08:59] family very much uh remember when the
[09:01] booms and the busts, you know, had
[09:02] cousins kind of with nothing to do when
[09:04] oil goes south of 45. Um these are these
[09:07] same communities here. Um you know, I'
[09:10] I'd love to kind of hear your thoughts
[09:12] on kind of somewhat of a dual challenge.
[09:14] number one finding enough people to um
[09:17] kind of partake in your guys' large
[09:18] scale developments, right? You guys have
[09:20] both several hundred megawws that are
[09:21] being built in these um um places and
[09:24] also um how do you you know attract
[09:26] those people as well. So how how can you
[09:28] get them to stay and how do you um you
[09:31] know perhaps you know if they're coming
[09:32] out of high school how can that you prep
[09:34] them up to succeed as well? Don't know
[09:36] if you guys have any comments there in
[09:37] regarding to kind of the the human
[09:39] capital that is in these communities.
[09:41] you know, a lot of these small towns,
[09:43] you know, I grew up in a in a small
[09:45] town, Lander, Wyoming, and it the town
[09:48] was decimated when US Steel closed down
[09:50] a facility there. And and many of these
[09:52] communities are the same way. And so
[09:54] when the jobs go away, what happens is
[09:56] kids graduate from high school and they
[09:57] have no choice but to leave. And when
[10:00] you bring these kind of opportunities
[10:02] into rural America, you get an
[10:03] opportunity for folks to go get an
[10:06] education, but then come back and be,
[10:08] you know, support the family. I was, you
[10:10] know, we were talking backstage,
[10:12] uh, Washington, Georgia. Kind of a cool
[10:15] little facility that we have there. The
[10:17] town was named after the president of
[10:19] the country when it was organized. So,
[10:21] it was it was founded in 1780. Um, and
[10:24] and and most of the the town is aging
[10:27] out and and it doesn't have a lot of
[10:30] there's not a lot of energy and
[10:31] enthusiasm. And when we went in there
[10:34] and and committed to build, the town had
[10:37] 7 megawatts of power. We now operate 86
[10:40] megawatts of power in this little town.
[10:42] Um, just to give you an idea of history,
[10:44] like we when when we signed the
[10:47] agreements for our our with the economic
[10:49] development director, the the historical
[10:52] plaque in their town hall indicates that
[10:54] that building still exists where the
[10:56] documents were signed that abolished the
[10:58] Confederacy. So these towns are they
[11:01] they know history, they know feast, and
[11:04] they know famine. And so to bring
[11:06] high-paying jobs, Bitcoin mining
[11:09] opportunities, um, mining technicians,
[11:12] but then we add another layer because we
[11:14] do repairs on all of our all of our
[11:17] servers in house. So now we're training
[11:19] people how to do repairs all the way
[11:22] down to the chip set in some of these
[11:24] remote rural towns. We create
[11:26] high-paying jobs. We attract people to
[11:29] come back home to support their original
[11:31] communities. And that reputation kind of
[11:34] precedes us. So when it comes time to go
[11:36] to the next town and you know we both
[11:38] operate in Dalton and and and both
[11:40] companies have kind of a a reputation
[11:43] for being um employeefriendly you know
[11:46] creating opportunities to grow and
[11:49] advance and be part of a you know a
[11:51] high-tech workforce in a place that
[11:53] really time forgot for a period of time.
[11:56] Yeah. And he he hit on a couple things I
[11:58] want to highlight. highpaying tech jobs
[12:00] in rural America. Politicians talk about
[12:02] that all the time, but we're actually
[12:04] doing it in the data center world. Uh
[12:06] we're doing it in Bitcoin mining. We're
[12:07] doing it in AI. Let's I hate to keep
[12:09] going on it, but it's the coolest little
[12:10] thing. Marble, North Carolina has 300
[12:12] people live there. And there was a
[12:14] thread factory there that had been
[12:16] closed. It was built in the 60s. It had
[12:17] been closed down uh in the 80s and it
[12:20] was closed throughout for 10 or 15
[12:21] years. We come in and in 2017 we turned
[12:24] into a Bitcoin mining operation and in
[12:26] January of 18 we actually mined the
[12:28] first Bitcoin there on large scale
[12:30] piece. We've since emptied it out as a
[12:33] Bitcoin miner and now it's filling up
[12:35] with 70 megawatts of GB200s guys. We
[12:38] we're building a $700 million data
[12:41] center in a town of 300 people and we've
[12:45] retrained the workforce there. So, we
[12:46] took folks that were coming out of high
[12:48] school and we trained them to be data
[12:49] center technicians on AS6 and now
[12:51] they're being trained to work on the
[12:53] most sophisticated AI compute on the
[12:55] planet. Think about that. The AI compute
[12:57] is $50 million a megawatt and we're
[12:59] deploying 70 megawatts worth there. So,
[13:02] these little towns uh highpaying jobs in
[13:05] rural America and and the folk the folks
[13:07] that work in these towns, they love it.
[13:09] the the the town fathers and the town
[13:11] the town elders they love the fact that
[13:12] the kids coming out of high school and
[13:14] in some cases college they can come back
[13:16] to the town they grew up in people love
[13:18] doing that most time they can't because
[13:19] there's no the right kind of jobs are
[13:21] not there so in in the instances like
[13:24] like Matt's talking about in their sites
[13:25] and some of our sites we're in these
[13:27] tiny towns but we're giving opportunity
[13:29] we're giving kids opportunity both high
[13:31] school and college to come back to their
[13:32] hometown and stay and really make a
[13:35] difference and I'll tell you what when
[13:37] you start talking about a small rural
[13:38] southern town as someone making six
[13:40] figures. That's a lot of expendable
[13:42] income. And what that happens is if you
[13:43] go and you see you go into downtown, you
[13:45] go to downtown Murphy, there's a bunch
[13:47] of restaurants there that are thriving
[13:49] because just the 40 or 50 people we add
[13:52] to the payroll, but they all are making
[13:54] three times what the medium family
[13:56] income is in the area. That's expendable
[13:58] income. And you guys follow economics,
[14:00] that's just a cycle. It's it all that
[14:01] money gets cycled around in that little
[14:03] community. So, it has a huge impact, a
[14:04] very real impact to these local
[14:06] communities. And that's why they like us
[14:08] there. No, I I appreciate that,
[14:11] gentlemen. It's um you know, it's you
[14:12] know, one person starts to go spend,
[14:14] then somebody else opens up a
[14:16] restaurant, then you know, their cousin
[14:17] then opens up a restaurant, and then now
[14:19] uh you know, the main street looks very
[14:21] different than it did a couple years
[14:22] ago. You know, that's something that,
[14:24] you know, you don't have to be able to
[14:26] uh sign a transaction on the Bitcoin
[14:28] network, though we all should know how
[14:29] to do that. Um you know, to really
[14:31] understand the impact of that in that
[14:33] regard. Um, you know, let's take a
[14:35] moment to talk about, you know, lessons
[14:37] that, you know, some of our peers can
[14:39] take from your guys' experience. You
[14:40] know, we may have some developers in the
[14:42] and or or some fellow miners in the
[14:44] audience. Um, you know, what what are
[14:46] things that we can learn from and and do
[14:49] right when we're, you know, going into a
[14:51] county for the first time? You know, you
[14:53] guys mentioned that, you know, a a
[14:55] utility that you have a good
[14:56] relationship is happy to allocate you
[14:58] more capacity. Sounds to me that if
[15:00] you're a good neighbor, you're, you
[15:02] know, they're they're going to continue
[15:03] to welcome you there. Um, you know,
[15:05] would love to hear some examples of what
[15:07] are some things that we can avoid, um,
[15:09] you know, going forward or some lessons
[15:11] that we can take from. You know, I I
[15:13] think in in CleanSpark's case, we as
[15:16] when we go into build something, um,
[15:19] Sandersville, Georgia, uh, we have 230
[15:22] megawatts of power there in a town of
[15:25] 10,000 people. And so when we go in to
[15:28] build a facility, we have a team of guys
[15:31] that go in and work with the community
[15:33] leaders with the economic development
[15:35] directors. So we task Scott Garrison's
[15:37] our COO and he gets tasked to go into
[15:40] these towns. He's a relationship guy. I
[15:42] mean, he was he he loves to golf. So
[15:44] Scott will go meet all the people, take
[15:46] him out golfing, explaining what we do,
[15:49] and then we build a plan. But what's
[15:51] really critical is when we build out
[15:53] these massive facilities and like what
[15:55] Russ is talking about, we use all local
[15:57] trades. We don't import that. So whether
[16:00] it's the excavation team or the
[16:02] electricians or the, you know, the guys
[16:04] that go vertical with construction,
[16:06] utilizing those local trades kind of
[16:08] spreads out that economic benefit and it
[16:11] really enders you to these communities.
[16:13] Nobody wants you to come to their little
[16:15] town and bring in your own crew, make a
[16:16] mess, and then blast off. We we we
[16:19] actually monetize these towns on
[16:21] multiple different levels and it creates
[16:24] relationships that you know the
[16:25] excavator in one town may know somebody
[16:28] at a utility in another town and talk
[16:30] about the positive experience that
[16:32] they've had with us. So while we you
[16:34] know obviously we've done a lot of
[16:36] branding here to kind of familiarize the
[16:38] Bitcoin community with CleanSpark but
[16:40] but what really has drawn us into many
[16:43] of these small communities is is really
[16:45] word of mouth just based on those
[16:47] experiences. So for us, it's a front
[16:49] door approach. It's being open and
[16:51] honest and transparent. It's about
[16:53] inviting the the community leaders,
[16:55] economic development directors to visit
[16:57] existing sites so you know what you're
[17:00] going to get, not just a rendering. You
[17:01] know what it sounds like. You know what
[17:03] it feels like. You know what the you
[17:04] know the inputs and the outputs are. You
[17:06] get to meet with the employees and
[17:09] understand what their experience is
[17:10] like. And and then what happens is they
[17:13] they have a realistic expectation of
[17:15] what it's going to look like in their
[17:17] community. And when we do that and we're
[17:19] consistent and we keep our word, then it
[17:21] just spreads. And we've got
[17:23] opportunities that have continued to
[17:24] grow. I mean, it started in Georgia, it
[17:26] spread to Tennessee, and now Wyoming,
[17:28] the opportunities there are are endless.
[17:31] You know, you got the ninth largest
[17:33] state by land mass, but dead last on
[17:36] population. So, you've got all these
[17:38] opportunities to monetize power and
[17:40] benefit these communities, and it's
[17:42] really starting to gain some traction.
[17:45] I would add too, if you're just getting
[17:47] into this, you need to be completely
[17:49] open book with the local town and the
[17:51] local uh utility company, if if there's
[17:54] some economic incentive they have going
[17:56] on that only makes mining work because
[17:57] of that economic incentive. If it's
[17:59] costing them money, then it doesn't work
[18:01] long term. So, you have to go in
[18:03] completely open book on what the
[18:05] economics of your business is and what
[18:07] the impact your business is going to
[18:08] have. So, if you're using power 100% of
[18:10] the time, you need to say, "Look, I'm
[18:11] using power 100% of the time. I'm
[18:13] turning on 100 megawatts in May. If if
[18:15] it changes, you have to let them know
[18:17] because these little local communities,
[18:18] as long as you go in there open book and
[18:20] and you go in the front door and not try
[18:22] to come in the back door under the
[18:23] porch, then it's going to establish the
[18:25] good long-term relationship because you
[18:27] have to make it win-win. I'll give you
[18:29] example like in in Marble, you know, we
[18:32] buy direct our generations direct from
[18:33] TVA, but we pay them onetenth of a penny
[18:36] override to ride on the local
[18:38] transportation. That's a very easy thing
[18:40] for the local co-op to figure out what
[18:41] their what their what their revenue is,
[18:43] right? They don't actually have risk of
[18:45] the generation. We're working with one
[18:46] of the largest utilities in America
[18:48] utilities in America to figure out what
[18:49] the generation is and figure out what
[18:50] the curtailment is so that the local
[18:52] local co-op doesn't have to worry about
[18:54] the fact that if the nuke plant uh that
[18:56] TVA has to take down for maintenance,
[18:58] they call on us to do a curtailment for
[18:59] 12 hours. That's with us and TVA. But we
[19:02] we we work with the the local co-op and
[19:04] they know exactly what their what their
[19:05] piece is. So, you don't want to you
[19:08] don't want to try to take advantage of
[19:09] some uh rebate or some kind of tax
[19:13] program or something that's local
[19:14] without explaining the impact you're
[19:17] going to have on on the utility grid and
[19:20] the local community because otherwise
[19:22] your relationship's good for a year or
[19:23] two, maybe even just a winter time and
[19:26] or a summer time depending on what what
[19:28] environment you're in. And as soon as it
[19:29] hits the fan with that utility because
[19:32] you weren't able to perform like you
[19:33] thought you were or you performed
[19:34] differently than way they thought you
[19:35] were then the relationship can sour. And
[19:38] once it sour it's very hard to to solve
[19:41] those problems. So go in there
[19:43] completely open book and understand your
[19:45] business. Also if you're just getting
[19:47] into this start off small. Don't go in
[19:49] and try to bowl the ocean. Go in there
[19:50] and get your one or two megawatts up and
[19:52] running and make sure you do it right
[19:53] first. uh because because if you go in
[19:56] there trying to bowl the ocean and you
[19:57] never bo the ocean before, you could
[19:58] really mess things up and it'll ruin
[19:59] your relationship with that town or that
[20:01] local utility. And and you know, another
[20:03] layer to that when you talked about the
[20:05] interruptible load. Bitcoin really is
[20:08] the perfect partner for a grid. It
[20:10] allows the utility to overbuild capacity
[20:13] without having to worry about energy
[20:14] storage or running that power to ground
[20:16] because we'll buy it whenever it's
[20:18] available and then we can make the
[20:20] economic decision to discontinue to buy
[20:23] when prices go up or difficulty is up or
[20:26] down. So, but but a a third kind of
[20:30] benefit is that we build more robust
[20:33] infrastructure in these small towns. And
[20:36] so when there's an event like for
[20:38] example everybody saw what happened with
[20:40] hurricane Helen a couple years ago
[20:42] Washington Georgia there the the main 7
[20:45] megawatt substation in that town was
[20:47] taken out by a hurricane. So now the
[20:49] hospital the schools all these critical
[20:51] loads are interrupted. Well we built
[20:53] more robust infrastructure and
[20:55] substations. We we had the opportunity
[20:58] and the ability to quickly curtail that
[21:00] load and to push the power back. So it
[21:02] was literally a blink and many towns
[21:04] throughout the southeastern United
[21:06] States were without power for an
[21:08] extended period of time. Noticeably
[21:10] different or exempt from that list were
[21:12] the communities with Bitcoin miners
[21:14] because Bitcoin miners can shut down.
[21:16] That power goes back to where it's most
[21:18] critically needed and and they can
[21:20] continue operations and we gradually
[21:22] ramp back up our production as the
[21:24] infrastructure was repaired and brought
[21:26] back online. So when that happens,
[21:28] people in the community see it, have
[21:30] that experience, know that it's a
[21:31] trusted partner, and it really does
[21:33] advance relationships. No, I think
[21:35] that's a great example of a real life
[21:38] benefit, right, of having these flexible
[21:40] loads um near your community. Um you
[21:42] know, I'd love to kind of look forward
[21:44] into the future. Um Russ, you mentioned,
[21:46] you know, having um you know, the town
[21:48] of 300 people. Um you know, now starting
[21:51] to, you know, you know, build and and
[21:53] and work with like the the most cutting
[21:55] edge GPUs that exist. Um you know, do do
[21:59] these young people, men and women,
[22:01] understand that they're powering all of
[22:03] Silicon Valley right now? Yeah, it's
[22:06] pretty interesting. Uh and they and they
[22:08] do. And it's pretty fun because you guys
[22:11] know this Core Scientific, we're
[22:12] converting a lot of our Bitcoin mining.
[22:13] We still have Bitcoin mining in West
[22:14] Texas and Kentucky, but we're converting
[22:15] a lot of our Bitcoin mining sites into
[22:17] AI sites. And two things happen there.
[22:20] One, just like I mentioned, you have to
[22:21] go in there with a front door. A a base
[22:23] load for AI is very different from the
[22:25] base load of Bitcoin mining. All those
[22:26] good things that he just talked about
[22:27] with Bitcoin mining as far as your power
[22:29] base and you can tell it, you can't do
[22:30] that with an AI load. The flip side
[22:32] though is true when you have a
[22:33] conversation with a co-op and you say,
[22:35] "I know I've been paying you two or
[22:36] three cents, but I can pay you a and
[22:39] I'll do it in two years." that gives
[22:41] them enough time to say, "Wait a
[22:42] minute." Okay, let's figure this out.
[22:44] So, again, you have to go in there with
[22:46] a front door. But to answer your
[22:47] question, yes, and and interesting
[22:48] enough uh the the kids are enjoying it.
[22:52] And I say they're kids because they're a
[22:54] lot younger than I am, but like it's it
[22:56] we really it's amazing to think that a
[22:58] textile factory became a Bitcoin miner
[23:01] and now it's going to be an AI
[23:02] supercomputer for, you know, Google and
[23:04] Open AI and all those kind of things. Or
[23:05] in Denton is it's is well known, guys.
[23:07] OpenAI. The first Stargate project for
[23:09] OpenAI is actually our Denton site. I
[23:11] think other people are talking about
[23:12] other sites, but we actually turned on 8
[23:13] megawatts this month and we turned on
[23:14] only 40 megawatts next month. Sam
[23:16] Alman's training his next uh models
[23:18] there. So like that site there was a was
[23:22] empty. It was a GA gas plant then became
[23:23] a Bitcoin miner and now it's going to
[23:25] become at the end of this year the
[23:26] largest supercomputer on the planet.
[23:28] It'll have 262 megawatts of GB200s
[23:30] running. I can't tell you how amazing
[23:32] that is. Uh but it's the exact same uh
[23:35] data center technicians that come out of
[23:36] the colleges there in Denton that train
[23:38] to be data center repair technicians on
[23:40] the on the repair boards ASIC repair
[23:42] boards that are now going to be data
[23:44] center technicians working in those AI
[23:45] supercomputer centers. Now there there's
[23:47] different training has to happen but
[23:49] they go through that training and they
[23:50] love it. I mean they absolutely enjoy
[23:51] it. No I appreciate that. Um Matt, you
[23:54] know, on the on the Bitcoin lens,
[23:56] looking into the future, you know,
[23:58] you're mentioning TVA, Wyoming, um lots
[24:01] of, you know, other data centers are
[24:03] looking to these places. How are you
[24:05] looking to kind of engage with the
[24:06] utilities? Do they come to you because
[24:08] you're a flexible load because you've
[24:10] put the proof of work to build out to
[24:11] several hundred megawatts. Um are you
[24:13] somewhat of like a resource when you
[24:15] know ex uh AI developer wants to come
[24:18] and put some certain proposal in front
[24:19] of them? Um you know, are you somewhat
[24:21] of a partner to them now? um a after
[24:23] building so much. Yeah. So, we're a
[24:26] different proposition than what Russ is
[24:28] talking about. There there are
[24:30] communities that have stranded power
[24:32] that they're looking to monetize today.
[24:34] Um Cheyenne, Wyoming is a good example.
[24:37] We were bidding for 85 megawatts of
[24:40] power there and the the utility
[24:43] ultimately had the decision, do I go
[24:44] with Clean Spark or do I go some other
[24:46] way? And the other customer happened to
[24:49] be a hyperscaler.
[24:51] The challenge is that a hyperscaler from
[24:54] the time they scrape the dirt and start
[24:56] to go vertical, it may be 3 years before
[25:00] the community is monetizing those
[25:01] megawatts. So even if it's at a premium,
[25:05] oftent times the incentive for a
[25:07] community and in our case in Cheyenne
[25:09] was we're going to pick the Bitcoin
[25:11] miner and we signed an agreement in July
[25:14] and by December we were buying those
[25:16] megawws and and creating a material
[25:19] impact on the revenue profile at
[25:21] community. So we're seeing these
[25:23] continued invitations. Not that there's
[25:25] not massive opportunities for um the AI
[25:29] side, but we look at many of the many of
[25:32] the small towns that we're being invited
[25:34] in. They they have these pockets of
[25:36] power, but maybe they're two or three or
[25:38] 400 miles from a major metropolitan
[25:40] area. So, in an AI application, latency
[25:44] becomes a challenge. So, it's less
[25:46] appealing other than for edge compute.
[25:48] And then they can't demand that 8 or 10
[25:51] cents that Russ is talking about. So
[25:53] there's there's a perfect opportunity
[25:55] for collaboration um for Bitcoin miners
[25:58] to work together with um AI, but we
[26:02] we've remained and I think we're the
[26:04] only remaining pure play Bitcoin miner
[26:07] because of the fact that by increasing
[26:10] our efficiency, focusing on really key
[26:12] metrics, we can afford to pay a bit more
[26:15] for power than most other miners can
[26:18] because we have higher uptime and
[26:20] greater efficiency. So, it becomes more
[26:23] of a win-win with the communities and
[26:25] and as a result, the demand is less. We
[26:27] don't we don't have, you know, a
[26:29] checklist of if we're going to come
[26:30] here, we need, you know, reliability uh
[26:33] uptime to the, you know, fifth decimal
[26:35] point. We're we're a much more flexible
[26:37] partner. And so, we're seeing continued
[26:40] pull through um for demand for Bitcoin
[26:42] mining in areas that that may be
[26:45] adjacent to high performance compute and
[26:48] also may be not a good candidate for
[26:50] HPC. Oh, no. Just for one thing. Yeah,
[26:53] go ahead. Just because it's interesting.
[26:54] Yeah. Uh he mentioned something that's
[26:56] super important too, like when the
[26:57] hyperscaler or big AI company's coming
[26:59] in, it's years. I mean, it's a lot
[27:01] different data center build. One of the
[27:03] reasons we were able to get some of our
[27:04] communities to give us more power and
[27:06] and work with us is because we're still
[27:08] Bitcoin mining all the way up until the
[27:09] time we turn on the AI GPUs. Dalton's a
[27:11] good example of that. We're Bitcoin. So,
[27:13] we're building the data center adjacent
[27:15] to the Bitcoin mining site. It's right
[27:17] beside it. But we're actually working
[27:18] with utility to say, "Look, we're going
[27:20] to Bitcoin mine all the way up." Because
[27:22] that's super important. I just told you
[27:23] we're in these long-term relationship
[27:24] with these communities. If we go in and
[27:26] turn off their entire revenue stream, it
[27:28] would decimate a little town. So, in
[27:30] every single instance, uh, we tried to
[27:31] work with the community, say, "Look,
[27:32] we're going to Bitcoin mine all the way
[27:34] up until the very last minute when we
[27:35] could flip it over because we have such
[27:37] an impact on the on the budgets." Yeah.
[27:39] And every megawatt hour counts for these
[27:41] communities, right? Whether it's
[27:42] Bitcoin, whether it's other
[27:43] applications, just having that that that
[27:45] acknowledgement is super important. Um
[27:48] gentlemen, we're coming up here on time.
[27:49] I really want to thank you for your
[27:51] discussion and participation today. You
[27:53] know, key takeaways for me, it's this is
[27:55] a relationship. It's a partnership,
[27:56] right? This is not transactional. Uh be
[27:58] open book, right? And you know, really
[28:01] emphasize the positives, right? Uh
[28:02] technology, jobs, tax base. This is why
[28:05] we're here. Um everybody, please give a
[28:07] round of applause to Russ and Matt.
[28:11] [Music]
