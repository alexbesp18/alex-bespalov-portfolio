[00:00] We're live from the Bitcoin Conference.
[00:03] This man deserves no introduction
[00:05] because everybody knows who he is, but
[00:08] it is the one and only Michael Sailor.
[00:12] Michael, how are you? How's the
[00:14] conference going? Best week of the year.
[00:17] I think this is the greatest Bitcoin
[00:18] conference ever to tell you the truth.
[00:21] Really? Why? Why is that? First of all,
[00:23] the energy is extraordinary. All the
[00:25] people are extraordinary. It's electric.
[00:27] But the number of announcements, you
[00:29] know, the GameStop announcement and
[00:31] Mayor Adams announcement about the bit
[00:33] bonds, you know, and Caner's
[00:36] announcement about Bitcoin credit, you
[00:38] know, and the Nakamoto announcement. We
[00:40] had the vice president here. We've never
[00:42] had a vice president of Bitcoin
[00:43] conference, right? So, Bitcoin being
[00:46] embraced by the government. We have
[00:48] cabinet members here. Bitcoin being
[00:50] embraced by states. Bitcoin being
[00:53] embraced by cities. Bitcoin being
[00:55] embraced by lots and lots of public
[00:58] companies. Bitcoin being embraced by the
[01:01] mainstream media rank and and file. And
[01:04] just the incredible surge of of
[01:06] Bitcoiners here. I think altogether
[01:09] that's extraordinary. How far we've
[01:12] come. Every single conference they each
[01:14] outperforms the other. What else is
[01:17] going to happen? where you had the
[01:18] president of the United States, the VP
[01:20] like are we going to have the monarchs
[01:22] from Saudi Arabia come and speak in time
[01:25] we're going to have country we had
[01:27] Pakistan announcing a strategic Bitcoin
[01:29] reserve in time we're going to have
[01:31] countries coming working to outdo each
[01:33] other and that will be a wonderful day
[01:36] that will 100% you know actually I've
[01:39] talked to many of the CEOs of the
[01:42] Bitcoin strategic reserves and all of
[01:45] them have confessed is that you're their
[01:48] mentor. I have to ask, who's your
[01:52] mentor? And because you're mentoring
[01:54] them, you must have like a mentor. And
[01:57] what do your days look like now that
[01:59] you're mentoring all these Bitcoin
[02:01] treasury companies?
[02:03] I I have gone through a 100,000 pages of
[02:07] economic history by Murray Rothbart of
[02:10] of political history by Will Durant all
[02:14] the Austrian economist Hayak and von
[02:17] Mises you know all of the political
[02:20] histories and and they're my mentors
[02:23] learning from that and then I've spent a
[02:25] lot of time communing with AI which
[02:28] which has also read all of them you know
[02:31] and discussing what it thinks and I'm
[02:34] very inspired by the great thinkers
[02:37] throughout the civilization.
[02:39] And of course, you know, if I had to
[02:41] pick one mentor of the modern era, it
[02:43] would be Satoshi because Satoshi gave us
[02:46] perfect money. And I date January 3rd,
[02:49] 2009 as the singularity.
[02:52] All of the historians, all of the
[02:54] writers I read, Voltater and Von Mises
[02:57] and Rothbart and Dur, they all lament
[03:01] that the world is an imperfect place,
[03:03] the money is broken, and uh government
[03:06] policy intervention doesn't work. All of
[03:09] them agree on that. It took Satoshi to
[03:11] give us the solution because the
[03:13] solution was for the first time in human
[03:16] history, we can tightly bind economic
[03:18] energy to the individual. put it in
[03:21] their head. And so this idea that we can
[03:24] invert the entire power structure of the
[03:27] human race by pulling the energy out of
[03:30] the land, out of the currency, out of
[03:32] the gold, out of the companies, out of
[03:35] the collectibles, out of the bonds and
[03:38] put it into the heads or the hands of
[03:41] the people. That's a profound
[03:44] breakthrough because that gave us the
[03:45] hope that we could actually deliver
[03:48] economic freedom, political freedom, you
[03:51] know, uh, dignity and sovereignty to
[03:54] humanity. I would like to say that was a
[03:56] dream before January 3rd. But the truth
[03:58] is all of these historians, all of these
[04:00] economists I've read, they never
[04:03] articulated the dream. They couldn't
[04:05] conceive of the solution. They just gave
[04:09] you a hundred examples of the problem.
[04:12] And so if there is one mentor, it's got
[04:15] to be Satoshi. 100%.
[04:18] And obviously we're starting the faces
[04:20] like you see um Bitcoin in a way
[04:25] entering the political realm. Is there a
[04:27] possible way that Bitcoin can fail?
[04:31] Because in a way we're still in the
[04:32] early stages. Bitcoin's a teenager in a
[04:35] way. And you're saying that it's our
[04:38] hope. Is there a way that like for
[04:40] example the politicians can try to
[04:43] centralize Bitcoin mining and for it to
[04:45] like Satoshi's vision kind of fall or do
[04:49] you think we've already passed that
[04:51] point and Bitcoin will succeed against
[04:54] all the odds? Bitcoin is a truth virus
[04:59] wrapped in a freedom virus wrapped in a
[05:04] monetary virus and it is spreading
[05:07] throughout the entire world. When 10
[05:10] people on the city block embrace it, it
[05:12] becomes more powerful. When the richest
[05:14] person on the block embraces it, it
[05:16] becomes more powerful again. When a
[05:18] small city embraces it, it becomes more
[05:20] powerful again. And the city's
[05:22] transformed. they become more truthful
[05:24] and they look out further and they
[05:26] become they become more rational and
[05:29] then everyone in the network benefits
[05:31] and so as Bitcoin spreads virally
[05:33] through cities and counties and states
[05:36] and countries on one hand it's drawing
[05:39] their energy on the other hand it's
[05:42] transforming them every single
[05:44] politician every single person that
[05:47] seeks to benefit from Bitcoin finds
[05:49] themselves transformed by Bitcoin So it
[05:53] is a virus, but it's a virus of
[05:56] rationale
[05:57] and and it's a it's a virus of truth and
[06:00] it's a it's a virus of soundness, sound
[06:03] money. So as more and more countries
[06:06] embrace it, it will actually make
[06:09] Bitcoin stronger. Bitcoin is better if
[06:11] if adversaries if the 20 superpowers in
[06:14] the world or the 20 powers in the world
[06:15] they all embrace it they will all uh
[06:19] create a counterveilling check and
[06:21] balance on each other that strengthens
[06:23] the protocol and actually strengthens
[06:26] everybody in the network. So I don't
[06:29] worry about it spreading to other
[06:31] countries. I don't worry about it
[06:32] spreading to more powerful companies or
[06:35] any other entity. I think Bitcoin is a
[06:39] perfect machine made of imperfect parts.
[06:44] And it is true that every single person
[06:46] that adopts Bitcoin will be imperfect.
[06:48] Every company, every government, they
[06:50] will all be imperfect. But they will
[06:52] give their energy to the network. The
[06:55] network will become even more
[06:57] anti-fragile, even more robust and even
[07:01] more powerful. And that is that is the
[07:04] impact of this brilliant crypto virus
[07:07] that was unleashed by Satoshi on the
[07:09] world. If you're stuck spending dollars,
[07:11] at least stop earning fiat rewards. Use
[07:15] Fold and earn Bitcoin on everyday
[07:17] spending, groceries, travel, even paying
[07:20] bills. And take advantage of Bitcoin
[07:23] rewards with merchants you might already
[07:25] shop with. It's the easiest way to stack
[07:28] sats. So, if you're in the United States
[07:31] and you don't have Fold yet, what are
[07:34] you doing? Buy, earn, and save in
[07:36] Bitcoin all in one app. Fold is the
[07:40] ultimate toolkit for making Bitcoin
[07:41] savings a daily habit. I want to talk
[07:44] about the 4242
[07:47] capital plan. How is that going for you
[07:50] guys? And can you simplify and tell us a
[07:53] little bit where that went? In August,
[07:57] uh, sorry, in October of 2024,
[08:00] we announced a 21-21 plan. We announced
[08:03] that we were going to raise 21 billion
[08:05] of equity and 21 billion of fixed income
[08:07] in order to buy Bitcoin. And that was 10
[08:10] times bigger than anything anybody had
[08:13] ever done in the history of the capital
[08:15] markets. It was the biggest equity uh
[08:18] filing in the history of the capital
[08:21] market, not just in the US, but
[08:22] anywhere. And people thought we were
[08:24] crazy. And we said, "Well, you know,
[08:26] give us three years. We'll get through
[08:29] it." You know, and then what came next
[08:32] was the red sweep followed by an orange
[08:36] cabinet
[08:38] followed by extraordinary enthusiasm.
[08:41] And we went through that first $21
[08:43] billion of equity in like four months.
[08:46] It went not three years, but three to
[08:48] four months. And then we were able to go
[08:50] and sell billions and billions of fixed
[08:52] income. And so we realized, you know,
[08:55] come this uh this quarter, we're about
[08:58] six months out, we decided that we
[09:01] needed to reset it. And so we double
[09:03] down to 42 in billion in equity and 42
[09:07] billion in fixed income.
[09:10] Again, setting our targets out three
[09:12] years. Maybe it will take us that long.
[09:14] Perhaps we will go faster. uh how fast
[09:17] we go is a function of uh the enthusiasm
[09:21] of the capital markets and the bitcoin
[09:24] market and then everything everyone else
[09:26] is doing in this community, right? When
[09:28] the mayor of New York announces that New
[09:31] York is behind the Bitbond that helps
[09:33] us, you know, when the government
[09:34] announced Bitcoin reserve that helps us,
[09:37] you know, should they buy lots of
[09:39] Bitcoin that will help us as well. So,
[09:42] we don't know exactly how fast we'll get
[09:44] through it, but we're confident that we
[09:45] will. And and the goal is to simply
[09:49] strengthen the Bitcoin network by
[09:51] funneling all of that capital from the
[09:55] fiat currency markets and the equity
[09:57] capital markets and the traditional
[09:59] credit markets into the Bitcoin economy.
[10:03] You mentioned New York. You know, New
[10:04] York, obviously, you talk about it a lot
[10:06] because of, you know, the real estate
[10:08] and everything and you also talk a lot
[10:10] about Bitcoin as digital real estate or
[10:13] digital capital. Besides accumulating it
[10:17] for shareholders, do you have any plans
[10:19] to use or build on strategies Bitcoin in
[10:22] the near future, you know, IE loans, a
[10:26] Bitcoinbacked bank loans, etc.
[10:29] Lots of people will come up with lots of
[10:31] things to do with digital capital over
[10:33] time. What we're doing with it is we're
[10:36] using it as collateral. It's the base
[10:39] layer that we use to issue billions of
[10:42] dollars of bonds. We've issued about $10
[10:44] billion of bonds that were backed by the
[10:47] Bitcoin. And now we've uh just issued
[10:50] two preferred stocks. one called Strike
[10:53] and there's about a billion dollars of
[10:55] it floating in the market now that is
[10:57] backed by the Bitcoin and another thing
[11:00] we issued called Strife that provides a
[11:02] 10% dividend at par value that's the
[11:06] sort of the highest yielding instrument
[11:08] of its kind in the market that is backed
[11:11] by Bitcoin so when people are buying
[11:14] this preferred stock called Strife we're
[11:16] going to give them 10% yield forever
[11:19] forever for a hundred years for thousand
[11:21] years. And so how are we doing that?
[11:24] We're investing our own Bitcoin. And
[11:27] then their question is, well, how will
[11:29] you pay us? Well, we're invested in
[11:30] Bitcoin. Bitcoin's appreciating. I think
[11:33] it'll appreciate 30% a year for the next
[11:35] 20 years. And then 20% or more. So the
[11:39] Bitcoin is the engine that is generating
[11:42] the dividends, that is generating the
[11:45] collateral and the security for those
[11:48] fixed income investors. The future of
[11:50] our company, our business strategy is we
[11:54] wish to be the global leader in the
[11:56] issuance of Bitcoin back credit. We want
[11:59] to issue uh a a preferred stock that
[12:03] gives you European yield in return for
[12:07] Bitcoin yield. So, we'll give the
[12:09] Europeans more yield than they're
[12:11] getting from their corporate bonds. Or
[12:13] we'll generate yield for the Japanese
[12:15] yen. So the Japanese investors get 50
[12:18] basis points in yield from their
[12:20] corporate bonds. If we go to Japan and
[12:23] offer 10 times that much, they're
[12:26] getting JPY yield. We will take back
[12:30] Bitcoin yield. You see? So what we're
[12:32] doing is we're creating Bitcoin yield
[12:34] for our equity investors and we're
[12:36] giving fiat yield for all of the
[12:40] conventional fixed income investors.
[12:43] That's a $30 trillion market. So when
[12:48] you're saying, well, what do how are we
[12:50] actually getting value for the Bitcoin?
[12:52] The Bitcoin is generating yield for our
[12:54] equity shareholders because every time
[12:57] we sell any of those fixed income
[12:59] instruments that generates BTC yield and
[13:03] then of course the fixed income
[13:05] instruments generate a more secure,
[13:07] higher yield for the conventional
[13:10] investors. And that's a business that
[13:13] can grow scalably uh for a long long
[13:16] time. The critical thing is we have to
[13:19] have the Bitcoin. We have the $60
[13:21] billion of Bitcoin collateral. That's
[13:24] what allows us to secure the loan and
[13:26] that's also what allows us to provide
[13:28] the performance to the convertible
[13:30] preferred stocks that the investors won.
[13:33] And so it's a very it's a very elegant
[13:36] strategy right now. The beauty of the
[13:39] strategy is we hold our own Bitcoin.
[13:40] We're not giving it to anybody else
[13:42] hoping they'll give it back to us. In
[13:44] essence, you know, it's a it's a Bitcoin
[13:47] back credit strategy. If I were to go to
[13:50] a conventional investor and I were to
[13:52] say, what would you rather have? 50%
[13:54] return and 50 V or 20% return and 20 V,
[14:01] the majority of them would want 20%
[14:03] return and 20 V. The actual market for
[14:06] that is 100x bigger. and and that's
[14:09] because they just don't want to get on
[14:11] the roller coaster and Bitcoin is a
[14:14] roller coaster for many. But having said
[14:17] all that, the world, the capital markets
[14:20] are structured. So there are some people
[14:23] that have billions of dollars to invest
[14:24] in venture capital. They have to invest
[14:27] in a private equity of a venture. There
[14:29] are other people that have billions of
[14:31] dollars to invest in bonds. They have to
[14:33] buy the bond. Other people have billions
[14:36] of dollars to invest in convertible
[14:37] bonds. They have to buy the convertible
[14:40] bond. Some people have billions of
[14:42] dollars to invest in equity.
[14:44] They can't buy Bitcoin. They can buy a
[14:47] Bitcoin company. And so when you look at
[14:50] the overall capital markets, and I'm
[14:52] talking about 400 to 500 trillion
[14:55] dollars, that's been structured over 50
[14:58] years. These people created that fund,
[15:01] all the famous money managers, you know,
[15:03] they've been in the business 30 years.
[15:05] So 10 years ago, they agreed with their
[15:08] limited partners, the pension funds and
[15:10] the endowments. They agreed they would
[15:12] invest that money with this strategy.
[15:15] They have to stay in their lane and and
[15:17] and the lane, the charter doesn't
[15:19] include Bitcoin. So what we're doing is
[15:23] we give if you're a private company, you
[15:25] give the venture capitalist Bitcoin
[15:27] preferred. And if you're public, you
[15:29] give the equity capitalist public
[15:31] equity. And if you give uh credit
[15:34] instruments to credit investors, they
[15:36] can buy it. Believe it or not, there are
[15:38] some people that can only invest in
[15:40] distressed debt from bankrupt companies.
[15:42] I do not intend to ever serve that
[15:44] market, right? I don't I'm not going to
[15:46] bankrupt myself to give them something
[15:48] to buy from me. But they have to buy
[15:51] that. And so once you understand where
[15:53] all the money is, you have the people in
[15:57] Japan, they want J Japanese yen
[16:00] denominated yield. I could say, "Well,
[16:03] I'll give you something better in
[16:04] dollars." They're like, "I can't buy
[16:05] it." We have a 10% yield in dollars
[16:09] right now. They're getting 50 basis
[16:12] points,
[16:13] 12th as much in yen. They're not going
[16:16] to buy the thing that's 20 times better.
[16:19] they might very well buy something that
[16:21] yields 4% in yen because it's in yen. So
[16:24] you have to go to the investors and give
[16:27] them the instrument they want structured
[16:29] the way they want in their capital
[16:31] market if you're going to get them to
[16:33] trade their capital for your security or
[16:36] your investment idea. And that's what
[16:38] we're doing as a business in order to
[16:41] grow the Bitcoin ecosystem and bridge
[16:44] the traditional capital markets with the
[16:46] crypto economy. And you've also said
[16:48] that endorsing other companies execute a
[16:51] similar Bitcoin accus accusition
[16:53] strategy through ATMs, convertible
[16:56] bonds, and other financial products
[16:59] won't threaten or compete with Micro
[17:01] Strategy's ability to do so. Why?
[17:04] Bitcoin is the most cooperative, most
[17:07] ethical, most inspirational network in
[17:09] the world. Every time someone joins the
[17:11] network and contributes their capital to
[17:13] the network, all the rest of us become
[17:15] more powerful, more secure, and more
[17:17] successful. So I could say, hey, it's
[17:22] like electricity. We have electricity.
[17:24] Every company's going to use
[17:25] electricity. Why would I threaten? But
[17:27] that would be a much weaker metaphor
[17:29] than the real metaphor. The real
[17:31] metaphor is there's only 450 Bitcoin
[17:34] available for per day. There is a drive
[17:36] shaft that's turning the entire network.
[17:40] Every time $50 million of capital flows
[17:42] in the Bitcoin ecosystem, we turn it
[17:44] once. So Nakamoto raises a billion and
[17:48] they turn that 20 times, right? And when
[17:51] GameStop raises 500 million, they turn
[17:53] that shaft 10 times, right? And uh when
[17:58] 21 raises their three billion, they turn
[18:01] it again. And so we're turning the drive
[18:03] shaft which is lifting everyone because
[18:06] once the $50 million of capital comes in
[18:08] the network, there are no natural
[18:10] sellers left. Now the price must go up
[18:13] to find a new seller. As the price goes
[18:16] up, everybody in the network becomes
[18:18] that much wealthier and that much more
[18:21] powerful. And all of their business
[18:23] strategies catch energy and momentum. So
[18:28] everyone will pursue their own strategy.
[18:31] The Metaplanet people raise capital from
[18:32] the Japanese market. I couldn't sell
[18:35] into the Japanese market. They're not
[18:37] competing with me. They're orange
[18:39] pilling the Japanese investors. They'll
[18:42] be Bitcoin treasury companies in Brazil.
[18:45] They'll be Bitcoin treasury companies in
[18:47] France, in Canada. They're all bringing
[18:50] their unique value proposition and they
[18:54] will help their nation, their their
[18:56] shareholders. But ultimately, the final
[18:58] beneficiary is always Bitcoin and the
[19:01] Bitcoin holder and everything that is a
[19:04] derivative of Bitcoin will benefit from
[19:06] that. So I I think we're in the early
[19:10] days where there's a dozen companies
[19:12] pursuing this hard and there's a hundred
[19:14] pursuing it lightly. But one day every
[19:17] public company will flip to the Bitcoin
[19:20] standard from the local fiat standard.
[19:23] And they'll do it because 25 years out,
[19:27] fiat sovereign debt will yield 3% and
[19:31] have a three ball and Bitcoin will be
[19:34] 20% with a 20 ball and it will still be
[19:37] seven, eight, 10 times better to be on
[19:39] the Bitcoin standard even after 20 years
[19:43] of all of us doing what we're doing. So
[19:45] I'm I'm not at all concerned. I think
[19:48] it's great for the C. All those
[19:50] companies will be successful if they
[19:51] don't make a rookie mistake. You still
[19:54] got to execute, but they're more likely
[19:57] than not to be successful. They will all
[19:59] pursue a different strategy. We will all
[20:01] learn from each other. We will all
[20:03] benefit each other. The ultimate
[20:05] beneficiary is the entire Bitcoin
[20:08] network. And speaking of these
[20:10] companies, they have uh a core business
[20:14] uh that ultimately they end up being,
[20:16] you know, insignificant compared to
[20:18] their treasury for strategy. Why is it
[20:22] still important to have a cash flowing
[20:24] business and why not just sell it for
[20:27] more Bitcoin? We love our customers. We
[20:30] love the business. The business, it's
[20:33] important to our customers to keep
[20:34] upgrading the software. It makes us
[20:37] money. And it's it's kind of like the
[20:40] example I gave of the dentist. If you're
[20:43] a dentist or a doctor and you love your
[20:45] work and you invest in Bitcoin and
[20:47] you're smart about it and you get
[20:48] insanely rich, you may still want to
[20:51] show up to work because you like having
[20:53] to do. If you were an artist, you would
[20:55] want to paint. So, if you love what
[20:56] you're doing, you're going to keep doing
[20:58] it. Everybody's got their operational
[21:00] business, right? Their uh their day job.
[21:04] If you if you get delight from what you
[21:07] do and you get a lot of uh positive
[21:10] feedback from your audience, you'll
[21:12] continue to do it. And uh Bitcoin will
[21:16] empower you, endow you with the wealth
[21:20] to do that without fear or anxiety or
[21:24] without taking shortterm shortcuts. And
[21:27] obviously you've helped many of these
[21:29] companies uh you know get the Bitcoin
[21:31] standard and become many strategies.
[21:34] Would strategy ever consider acquiring
[21:37] stakes in these companies as an
[21:39] investment?
[21:40] Our business strategy is to be 100%
[21:44] Bitcoin. Um and so we will always buy
[21:48] Bitcoin. Bitcoin is our hurdle rate. And
[21:50] there are a couple reasons for that
[21:52] really almost three. One, we want to be
[21:55] neutral because I want to help hundreds
[21:57] of companies and I don't I can't afford
[21:59] to play favorites and I don't have
[22:01] enough time to be invested in just three
[22:04] of them. The second is all of our credit
[22:08] instruments we sell, those are all based
[22:10] upon a homogeneous credit risk. You're
[22:14] holding Bitcoin. Are there any
[22:16] complications? No. If I were to invest
[22:19] in 22 things, then there would be 25
[22:22] pages of disclosures for each thing and
[22:25] there'd be 250 pages of consideration.
[22:28] And I don't want to complicate the
[22:30] decision my investors make. I want to be
[22:34] hyper transparent. You know, if if one
[22:36] of them were to work differently than
[22:38] Bitcoin, even if it was better or worse,
[22:41] the company becomes opaque. and it
[22:43] becomes opaque, it's hard for people to
[22:45] understand and to and to to trust us.
[22:49] See, part of our value proposition is is
[22:53] because you know exactly what we're
[22:54] going to do.
[22:56] If you disagree with it, you can short
[22:59] us with 20x leverage. And if you agree
[23:02] with it, you can go long with 20x
[23:04] leverage. And you could put on a billion
[23:07] dollar bet that's good for four weeks.
[23:09] The last thing you want is for me to
[23:12] say, "Oh, we're investing in a new
[23:14] business and we're very excited and it
[23:16] might, you know, and and it just screws
[23:18] up that guy's billion dollar bet and
[23:20] that guy's billion dollar bet and now
[23:22] they're like, I can't trust the company.
[23:24] I don't know what they're going to do.
[23:25] I'm just going to sell. I don't want to
[23:28] play the game." So our our job is to be
[23:33] neutral Switzerland with regard to the
[23:35] ecosystem and make everybody successful,
[23:37] but also to be laserike in our business
[23:41] model, which is we're going to create
[23:43] equity, which is which is going to be
[23:46] levered Bitcoin. We're going to attempt
[23:48] to outperform Bitcoin with leverage, and
[23:50] we're going to create credit instruments
[23:51] that strip volatility and risk and
[23:54] performance off of Bitcoin. and we're
[23:57] going to keep doing it the same way. And
[24:00] uh I think all these other businesses
[24:02] are great opportunities for private
[24:04] equity investors, venture capital
[24:06] investors. They have other pools of
[24:08] capital that is uh not invested in
[24:11] Bitcoin. You could the way you could
[24:13] think of it is my $65 billion of Bitcoin
[24:17] is pledged to support the equity and to
[24:21] support the bonds and support the
[24:24] preferred stocks. And I need to make
[24:27] sure that that uh that that pledge
[24:29] remains inviable. And I need people to
[24:32] say that's what they're going to do for
[24:33] the next decade. And if I believe that,
[24:36] then I will buy something and I will
[24:38] hold it for a decade or 20 years or 30
[24:40] years. We want people to know what we
[24:42] stand for. And uh this is what we stand
[24:44] for. Bitcoin forever. Bitcoin forever. I
[24:47] love that. You also recently said it
[24:50] would be unsafe to do proof of reserves.
[24:53] However, your Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
[24:55] competitors, MetaPlanet and 21 Capital,
[24:58] are both doing proof of reserves. Do you
[25:01] think they're making a mistake?
[25:04] I think it's just a complicated subject.
[25:06] It depends on the the size of the
[25:08] company, the capital market you in
[25:10] you're in. It depends on the scope of
[25:12] your operations, and it depends upon
[25:14] your regulators.
[25:16] For us right now, it's important to note
[25:18] that a public company selling an equity
[25:22] has to post a proof of assets and a
[25:25] proof of liabilities
[25:27] that's audited and signed off by the
[25:29] auditors with the annual report every
[25:31] year and with the 10 10 uh Q every
[25:34] quarter. when you post that that has to
[25:37] be signed by the officers but with an
[25:40] attestation under Sarbain Oxley and then
[25:44] all of the related parties to the
[25:47] officers and directors have to be
[25:48] disclosed. So you see, you couldn't
[25:51] reasonably make an investment in a
[25:53] public company without knowing there are
[25:55] no related parties, without knowing
[25:57] there are no side agreements, without
[25:59] knowing the scope of all the liabilities
[26:02] and then all the assets. And that's the
[26:05] best practice and that's generally what
[26:07] equity investors big ones in the US
[26:09] expect.
[26:11] Um I think that the proof of reserves
[26:14] offers you the chance to see what's in a
[26:17] wallet. What it doesn't do is solve the
[26:20] question of are there liabilities
[26:22] against the wallet? Are there related
[26:24] parties that own part of the wallet? Are
[26:26] there any side agreements that are in
[26:29] the wallet? And uh you can't ever really
[26:32] know that without a full audit. So I
[26:36] think I think they will do it. There
[26:39] will be some benefits for people to
[26:41] publish it. There will be there will be
[26:44] uh security complications because you
[26:48] know I wouldn't recommend any individual
[26:51] go on X and publish their Bitcoin wallet
[26:54] address to the world because you would
[26:56] have everyone tracking you. Uh I I think
[27:01] that we will learn from what everybody
[27:04] does. And I think the great thing about
[27:06] the ecosystem is with this many
[27:08] companies, there are some companies
[27:10] going to try different strategies.
[27:12] They'll do well, for example, people
[27:14] will do things that my lawyers would
[27:15] tell me I can't do or I shouldn't do.
[27:19] And uh so they will do it and if it
[27:22] works, then I will take that and go back
[27:24] to my attorney and say, "Look, it
[27:26] worked. The regulator said it was okay.
[27:29] The banker said it was okay. It worked.
[27:30] And maybe we should do it." And if it
[27:32] doesn't work, then we'll say, well, I
[27:35] guess guess the lawyers or the
[27:36] accountants or whatever, right? So, I
[27:38] think we're still early days and um and
[27:42] uh we'll see how it all works out. Only
[27:45] time will tell. Speaking of time, what
[27:48] is the most interesting or coolest thing
[27:51] that you've learned about Bitcoin this
[27:54] year? I think the coolest thing that
[27:57] I've learned about Bitcoin this year is
[28:02] just the incredible
[28:04] diverse appeal that it has globally,
[28:08] right? The the number of actors from
[28:12] people in Brazil, people in, you know,
[28:14] actors in Mexico, actors in in Pakistan,
[28:17] actors in the Middle East, actors in
[28:19] France, in the UK, the explosion of
[28:22] excitement about Bitcoin, Bitcoin,
[28:25] Treasury companies. I meet someone like,
[28:27] "Yeah, I'm doing this in UAE. I'm doing
[28:29] this in Hong Kong. I'm doing this in UK.
[28:32] I'm doing this in Norway. Like the
[28:34] explosion of that and then every time
[28:36] you see an exciting announcement, a
[28:38] soccer team that's embracing Bitcoin,
[28:41] GameStop embracing Bitcoin, the mayor of
[28:44] the biggest city in the United States
[28:45] embracing Bitcoin. These this is a
[28:48] classic example of a of a viral
[28:51] explosive phenomena.
[28:54] you know this, you know, there's no way
[28:57] you can stop an idea whose time has come
[28:59] and you just you see indicators this
[29:02] year that the time has come for this
[29:04] idea. And what would you say your
[29:06] hottest take on Bitcoin is? Most of the
[29:09] risk, if not all of the risk, in my
[29:12] opinion, has been stripped off it in the
[29:14] past four years, especially over the
[29:17] past 12 months. And yet most people
[29:21] don't appreciate this fact. Right? So,
[29:24] so we're at a very critical inflection
[29:27] point where you already know the banks
[29:29] will embrace it, the insurance companies
[29:31] will embrace it, the governments will
[29:32] embrace it, you know, the accounting
[29:35] professionals embraced it, Wall Street
[29:36] has embraced it, companies have embraced
[29:38] it, international markets have embraced
[29:40] it. You can see it all. And yet the
[29:43] conventional investor, the mainstream
[29:45] media, they still don't get it yet.
[29:49] And so this is like a once ina lifetime
[29:52] opportunity where you can know
[29:54] something. You know the future. It's
[29:57] very clear. You know why the future is
[30:00] clear and everybody else just doesn't
[30:02] see the future yet. And that's the
[30:04] superpower I think we all have in this
[30:06] industry right now. I love that because
[30:09] yeah, we're 100% still early. Thank you
[30:12] so much,
