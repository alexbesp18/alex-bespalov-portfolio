[00:00] Welcome, John. Well, here we are. Here
[00:02] we are. Who would have guessed, right?
[00:04] Amazing. It's been an incredible
[00:06] journey. Uh, for those of you who don't
[00:08] know, uh, John Perkins, I'll do a quick
[00:10] intro, wrote a number of incredible
[00:13] books, one of which is called
[00:14] Confessions of an Economic Hitman. He
[00:17] was a whistleblower upon extractive debt
[00:20] policies uh enacted by the World Bank
[00:23] and the IMF out of developing nations
[00:26] and has an incredible story to tell
[00:28] firsthand. So a lot of the things we
[00:31] know about as Bitcoiners about the IMF
[00:33] about the World Bank, John can validate
[00:36] these because he was the guy doing these
[00:39] things. So John, it's a great privilege
[00:41] to have you here. And before we start on
[00:44] this subject, I would just love to hear
[00:45] your definition. What is economic
[00:48] imperialism? You're probably one of the
[00:50] best people in the world to give that
[00:51] answer.
[00:53] Thank you, Daniel. And it's great great
[00:55] to be here. I've been learning so much
[00:56] during this conference. What a great
[00:58] conference.
[01:00] um
[01:01] you know it's you know yeah not only do
[01:05] I know about economic imperialism I was
[01:07] the economic imperialist you know it was
[01:10] my job was my my real title was chief
[01:13] economist at a major US consulting firm
[01:16] but my job was to go to countries that
[01:18] had resources our corporations covet
[01:20] like oil and then arrange a huge loan to
[01:23] that country from the world bank or one
[01:26] of its sister organizations but the
[01:28] money never actually went to the
[01:30] country. Instead, it went to our own
[01:32] corporations, usually big construction
[01:34] engineering corporations or companies
[01:36] like General Electric, Beal,
[01:38] Hallebertton, and so forth to build
[01:41] infrastructure projects in that country.
[01:44] Now, these corporations made big profits
[01:47] off building these infrastructure
[01:49] projects and the the wealthy people in
[01:53] the country benefited because these were
[01:54] projects like huge uh electrical systems
[01:58] and industrial parks, airports, ports,
[02:03] highways, things that benefited a few
[02:06] wealthy families as well as our
[02:08] corporations and multinational
[02:10] corporations. But in the end the country
[02:13] was left holding a huge debt and at that
[02:16] point the economic hit I went back to
[02:19] the country and said hey and I went back
[02:21] usually in the guise of the
[02:22] international monetary fund which is the
[02:25] policing authority and said hey since
[02:27] you can't pay your debts sell your
[02:30] resource oil or whatever real cheap to
[02:34] our corporations without environmental
[02:36] or social regulations just real cheap.
[02:39] Oh, and by the way, let us build a
[02:41] military base on your soil. Vote with us
[02:44] in the next UN vote against Cuba or or
[02:47] whatever. So, really, we were creating
[02:50] an empire without the military. But I
[02:53] got to say, we had the military behind
[02:55] us and we had guys called jackals and
[02:59] these are guys who uh if if if a
[03:01] president of a country didn't buy into
[03:03] what we wanted them to do, these guys
[03:06] came in and threatened them. And we just
[03:08] heard from the mayor of Panama City. I
[03:10] had an office in Panama City. I was
[03:12] working with Omar Trios who refused to
[03:15] play the game and went down in a very,
[03:18] very suspicious private plane crash,
[03:20] which most of Latin America knows or
[03:22] assumes was done by the Jackals. So, in
[03:26] essence, to summarize, I'd go into a
[03:28] president's office, Danielle, and say,
[03:30] "Hey, Mr. President, in this hand, I got
[03:32] a few billion dollars for you and your
[03:34] family if you play the game. If you
[03:37] don't, in this hand, I got a gun.
[03:40] That's it. How do you like that? And
[03:43] you've seen this firsthand. One of the
[03:45] things you said in your books and then
[03:46] also in your interviews is that often
[03:49] you would go looking for the countries
[03:51] that were most likely to default on the
[03:53] loans because then the IMF could come in
[03:56] and restructure and then it could have
[03:57] these extractive policies where it could
[03:59] take the oil, it could take the cobalt,
[04:01] etc.
[04:03] Well, we structured the loans so that
[04:05] they would be more than the country
[04:06] could pay in almost every circumstance.
[04:09] And of course, this was all dependent on
[04:10] the Federal Reserve and the US dollar.
[04:13] Without without the US dollar being the
[04:15] world's reserve currency, I couldn't
[04:17] have done my job the way I did. You you
[04:19] mentioned before one of your interviews
[04:22] that the Federal Reserve has no place to
[04:24] exist on this world and we need to
[04:26] remove it. Can you tell us why?
[04:33] Thank you. Yes. Uh it's a lousy system
[04:36] and and and it enables uh the United
[04:39] States to uh dominate uh to be the
[04:42] imperialist country that that it's
[04:44] become. And you know, typically
[04:46] throughout history, uh empires have been
[04:49] built by militaries, but this one has
[04:52] been built primarily by through
[04:54] economics until fairly recently where
[04:57] the military came back in after 911. And
[04:59] we've used we we we've used both. But
[05:02] the Federal Reserve is so terribly
[05:04] important in that because because with
[05:06] the Federal Reserve, we can impose
[05:08] sanctions. Uh we can make sure that
[05:11] countries pay their pay pay heavy
[05:13] interest rates on these loans. Uh
[05:15] without the Federal Reserve, without the
[05:17] dollar being the reserve currency of the
[05:19] world, uh this imperialistic uh economic
[05:22] policy wouldn't work. Do you think this
[05:25] system was created, it was corrupt from
[05:27] inception or do you think at some point
[05:29] it was actually done with good
[05:30] intentions but somewhere along the line
[05:32] it became extractive? That's a that's an
[05:35] interesting question and I think
[05:37] originally the World Bank was created in
[05:39] 1944 at the end of World War II. uh and
[05:42] it was created to rebuild a devastated
[05:45] Europe and you know that was altruistic
[05:48] in a way. We wanted to help Europe but
[05:50] it was also very very good policy for
[05:53] the US because we were creating a buffer
[05:55] against the Soviet Union which was now
[05:57] you know communism was a big threat. So
[05:59] Europe is that buffer also it provided
[06:01] big markets for US goods. So, but but in
[06:05] essence, I think the World Bank did a
[06:06] good job along with the Marshall Plan of
[06:08] helping to rebuild Europe, which was
[06:10] which was important. But then as the
[06:13] cold war grew, the World Bank became a a
[06:18] policy maker to counteract communism
[06:21] around the world. And that meant
[06:23] supporting big corporations, US
[06:25] corporations, which is what I did, you
[06:28] know, bring and bringing in resources
[06:30] from other countries. So increasingly
[06:32] the World Bank played this role as a
[06:34] policy maker and a defender of US
[06:37] imperialism. And then when the 1991 the
[06:40] Soviet Union dissolves, the World Bank
[06:43] is still in this position of working
[06:45] closely with corporations.
[06:47] And I think one other important thing to
[06:49] understand is that most of the people
[06:50] high up in the World Bank and all of its
[06:52] sister organizations, Interamerican
[06:54] Development Bank, IMF, African
[06:57] Development Bank, etc. come most of them
[07:00] come from being ministers of finance or
[07:02] presidents of other countries. So
[07:04] they're part of the system that they
[07:06] want to keep perpetuating which again is
[07:09] based on the dollar and they know how to
[07:11] use debt as a weapon and they're
[07:13] incentivized to get the maximum
[07:15] resources, the maximum amount of money
[07:17] back. So it's no surprise that actually
[07:18] it becomes an extractive system. I saw a
[07:21] diagram recently that said that there's
[07:23] actually more money going from the
[07:24] developing world to the first world
[07:26] nations than there is the other way
[07:27] round through aid by a factor of about
[07:29] 10 to1 through these loans. There's a
[07:32] cautionary tale I think when you say
[07:34] that it was set up with good intentions
[07:35] and somewhere along the line it's become
[07:37] more extractive. I want to pivot the
[07:39] conversation towards Bitcoin and I know
[07:41] you've been on a learning journey with
[07:42] that recently
[07:44] because of the position you've been in.
[07:46] You've seen how systems can become
[07:47] corrupted even with good intentions.
[07:50] What do you think the promise is of
[07:52] Bitcoin? But I also want to look at what
[07:54] the cautionary signs are. Where do you
[07:56] think we need to be careful as Bitcoin
[07:58] is that this doesn't become corrupted in
[08:00] some way that it doesn't become captured
[08:03] by a new oligarchy for example and you
[08:05] voice concerns about this. I want to
[08:07] start but before we look at the promise
[08:09] just tell us about what you think we
[08:10] need to be mindful of from your own
[08:12] firsthand experiences.
[08:14] Well, yes. Uh, you know, I think we've
[08:17] heard at this conference all the really
[08:18] good things Bitcoin can do and and and
[08:21] one of those is to get rid of this debt
[08:23] trap that I was creating and and many
[08:25] other things. But it does concern me uh
[08:29] that that the hoarding of Bitcoin or the
[08:32] use of Bitcoin not in a productive
[08:34] method. But you I own Bitcoin and I
[08:37] don't want to sell it. You know, I want
[08:39] to watch it grow. That's not
[08:41] particularly good for the You heard
[08:42] that? He said he owns Bitcoin.
[08:47] Yeah. The economic hitman owns Bitcoin.
[08:51] Um, so
[08:53] some of your friends weren't very happy
[08:55] that you were coming to this conference.
[08:56] Correct. You want to tell us a little
[08:57] bit about that? Well, I I think this is
[08:59] an interesting point that, you know, it
[09:01] seems to me that climate change has been
[09:03] a has become a democratic policy. you
[09:06] know, it's it's been politicized
[09:09] and Bitcoin has become a Republican kind
[09:12] of politicized and I'd like to see that
[09:14] changed. You know, I think it would be
[09:16] important not just to have Republican
[09:18] speakers like, you know, the I I thought
[09:21] JD Vance did a brilliant job of of
[09:23] pointing out that although he would like
[09:27] to see the Republicans continue in
[09:29] power, he you got to recognize that in
[09:31] politics, anything can happen. And
[09:33] therefore, it's really important for
[09:35] Bitcoin to become uh acceptable to
[09:38] Democrats and to become and to you know
[09:40] that like like the most recent genius
[09:42] act where you had 16 Democrats report.
[09:45] That's so important that you Bitcoiners
[09:48] get get the Democrats get everybody
[09:50] behind it. This should not be a divisive
[09:52] issue. If we want to be a world leader
[09:56] in crypto and in technology and in
[09:59] everything else, we must come together
[10:01] as a nation. this divisiveness is not
[10:04] serving us well. I just came back from
[10:06] Central America and Latin America. I
[10:08] spent a lot of time there and
[10:11] unfortunately, you know, they're seeing
[10:13] us as a very divided nation. I recently
[10:16] had a person very high up in the
[10:18] government of Ecuador say, you know, the
[10:20] United States is like, you're you're the
[10:22] largest banana republic in the world and
[10:24] you don't even have bananas.
[10:27] That's, you know, I hate to hear that.
[10:29] And I think it's really really important
[10:32] that we take this out of the politicized
[10:34] arena and recognize that Bitcoin has a
[10:37] really important job to play in the
[10:39] world, but we need to bring everybody on
[10:42] board in that job and we need to be very
[10:45] very careful.
[10:48] We we were talking before and saying
[10:50] imagine the internet if only 40% of the
[10:53] population felt it aligned with their
[10:55] values. You could never have got
[10:57] ubiquity. And it's only when a
[10:58] technology embraces values across a
[11:00] spectrum that it be can become truly
[11:03] disrupted. And had the internet only
[11:05] appealed to 40% of the population. You
[11:07] wouldn't have got 40% adoption. You
[11:08] would have got point4. And so you know
[11:11] what about of an intention as the next
[11:13] Bitcoin conference. You have five
[11:15] senators and governors from the
[11:16] Democrats. You have the Libertarian
[11:18] Party. You have the Green Party. You
[11:20] have the Republican party. You have
[11:21] every single political party represented
[11:23] speaking about how Bitcoin aligns with
[11:25] their values. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we
[11:28] had 16 Democratic senators vote for the
[11:30] Genius Act. They should be here. Why
[11:32] aren't they here? Or at least a couple.
[11:33] We'll bring them next time. Yeah. So, um
[11:36] and I think we really have to be careful
[11:38] uh to to not replace the Federal Reserve
[11:43] and the bankers uh oligarchy with a new
[11:46] Bitcoin oligarchy. It concerns me that
[11:49] we know that Saudi Arabia is building up
[11:52] a big reserve, Russia, uh, China, and
[11:56] these countries actually can take
[11:58] control, you know, if they if you have
[12:01] enough Bitcoin and you're a country like
[12:03] Saudi Arabia, you can be a small
[12:05] country, you can be not have a big
[12:07] military, but if you happen to own more
[12:09] Bitcoin than anybody else in the world,
[12:11] and you decided to use that to
[12:13] manipulate price, you could do that. An
[12:16] individual could do that, too. you know
[12:18] the James Bond Dr. No movies that where
[12:21] Dr. No had all the gold in the world. I
[12:23] I think we have to be really really
[12:25] careful to make sure that we all of us
[12:28] and get all your friends you like you
[12:31] said libertarians, Democrats,
[12:33] Republicans, get everybody to buy
[12:35] Bitcoin
[12:36] and then it becomes democratized.
[12:39] You know
[12:41] that's what we need as a democracy. We
[12:43] need to get it out there on a big level,
[12:46] not just one sector of the population
[12:48] owning it. So there there are some of
[12:50] the cautionary tales. Talk about the
[12:52] promise. Talk about where you see that
[12:54] Bitcoin has the promise to stop exactly
[12:57] the sort of economic imperialism that
[12:59] you've seen and participated in
[13:01] firsthand. What gets you most excited?
[13:04] Well, that it that it can't be used for
[13:06] this debt trap that that that you know
[13:08] it's Tell us why not. Like I'll play
[13:11] devil's advocate here. How why not? Why
[13:13] is it better? How can it help?
[13:14] Specifically, because the US government
[13:17] has has control over the dollar. You
[13:19] know, how much how many dollars are we
[13:21] going to create? We can create keep
[13:22] creating dollars and using them as
[13:26] policy weapons as I did as an economic
[13:28] hitman. We just keep creating them and
[13:30] doing that. You can't do that with
[13:31] Bitcoin. So, if Bitcoin becomes the the
[13:33] more standard international currency, it
[13:36] can't be used in that sort of way. It
[13:38] also can be used then as we I mean we've
[13:40] heard this I don't need to talk very
[13:42] much about this because other speakers
[13:44] have but but you know how we can it can
[13:46] it can foster across border exchanges of
[13:49] money whether it's for individuals or
[13:51] businesses that's that's very low cost
[13:54] to do and instantaneous unlike the
[13:57] dollar which takes a lot of time and is
[13:59] pretty much limited to people that know
[14:01] what they're doing. Uh and so it it can
[14:05] you know it's it just it has so many
[14:08] advantages in terms of international
[14:10] trade encouraging innovation across the
[14:14] world that we don't as someone mentioned
[14:16] an earlier um the event that we don't we
[14:20] don't have to recognize any borders with
[14:22] Bitcoin as you do with the dollar and
[14:24] then you've got different countries with
[14:25] different currencies and so but the US
[14:28] dollar always plays that commanding role
[14:32] and And I think the alternative at this
[14:34] point,
[14:36] Bitcoin isn't the alternative that we
[14:38] want, but the other alternative that's
[14:39] possible is the Chinese yen. It's it's
[14:43] that that could be the next global
[14:45] reserve. And I don't think we want that.
[14:50] It's it's incredible the potential. And
[14:53] there's a phrase by Peter Ducker who
[14:56] once said that the best way to create
[14:58] the future or the best way to predict
[15:01] the future is to create it. And it's
[15:04] true that we know certain things are
[15:05] true about Bitcoin. There will only ever
[15:07] be 21 million Bitcoin.
[15:10] And it's up to us. It's not yet written
[15:12] in the code, but it's written in our
[15:14] hearts whether it has the potential to
[15:16] is it only going to be a store of value
[15:18] or does it have the potential to break
[15:20] the chains of economic imperialism? I
[15:23] met a number of people, John, who read
[15:25] your book who said if it wasn't for your
[15:27] book, they couldn't have become a
[15:29] Bitcoiner because your book alerted them
[15:32] to the problem that they could see that
[15:34] Bitcoin could solve.
[15:37] Yeah, thank you. You know, I I think so
[15:40] what I mentioned before that when we go
[15:42] in to a country that's deeply indebted
[15:44] to us and demand that it sell its
[15:46] resources to our corporations that it
[15:49] build a military US allowed the US to
[15:52] build a military base on its soil etc.
[15:54] Those are called conditionalities or
[15:56] structural adjustment programs by the
[15:58] World Bank and they can only happen with
[16:01] the dollar. So if we've got Bitcoin in
[16:03] there, the IMF loses its power to impose
[16:07] those kinds of things. And to a certain
[16:08] degree, the same is true of sanctions
[16:10] and tariffs. The IMF has been in their
[16:13] latest loan agreement with El Salvador.
[16:15] I believe Bitcoin was mentioned 221
[16:18] times.
[16:20] Why do you think? And when I was doing a
[16:22] lot of the fud fighting about getting to
[16:24] the source of who was creating most of
[16:26] the disinformation about Bitcoin, it was
[16:28] the three central banks from Europe and
[16:32] the IMF. Why do you think the IMF is
[16:34] putting out so much misinformation about
[16:36] Bitcoin? Why are they scared? What are
[16:38] they going to lose? Come on, Daniel. You
[16:41] you you want to hear it from your lips.
[16:42] What are they going to lose? Well,
[16:44] they're going to lose power. They're
[16:45] going to lose control. uh they're going
[16:47] to lose their position as as you know
[16:50] the number one financial institution in
[16:52] the world that has tremendous control.
[16:54] So we really have created the world's uh
[16:58] largest historically the world's largest
[17:01] empire and it's been done through money.
[17:04] It's been done through through our
[17:06] banking systems. It's it's for the most
[17:08] part not been done through the military
[17:10] and that's a first in history. You know
[17:12] other empires were created militarily
[17:14] and so it's been very subtle. So we like
[17:17] to say well we go in and support
[17:18] democracy
[17:20] but we support a lot of dictators around
[17:22] the world. Pino and Chile and the sh of
[17:25] Iran who I spent a lot of time working
[17:27] with terrible and the the royal house of
[17:30] Saudi Arabia. You know we we are not out
[17:32] there supporting democracy. We're out
[17:35] there supporting whatever governments
[17:36] will help the dollar.
[17:39] Have you thought about your next book
[17:40] being about Bitcoin?
[17:42] Yeah. I just you know I've written a
[17:44] number of books that are nonfiction and
[17:46] I just published a a fiction uh book
[17:49] called message from pleades message from
[17:52] the stars what what are what is the
[17:54] message from out there uh it's only
[17:57] digital and you can get it at my website
[17:59] or other any of the digital platforms
[18:02] and I loved writing this novel because I
[18:04] thought there's a lot of people that
[18:06] don't read non-fiction plus I really
[18:08] enjoyed it so I'm kind of thinking well
[18:10] maybe my next novel should should should
[18:12] involve called Bitcoin. What do you
[18:14] think? What do you think?
[18:19] And then it becomes a movie, right?
[18:21] Yeah. And then we we get everybody to
[18:24] buy. And this is I would not have said
[18:27] this a couple of months ago, but when I
[18:30] was invited to this conference and I
[18:31] said to the conference, the person who
[18:33] invited me, why on earth would you want
[18:35] me? I don't know a damn thing about
[18:36] Bitcoin. I own some, but I don't know
[18:38] enough to talk about it. And since then,
[18:40] I've done a lot of study. I've put a lot
[18:43] into it talking to you a lot. You've
[18:44] helped me a lot, Daniel. Thank you. We
[18:46] had some concerns about its
[18:47] environmental impact. Yeah, we haven't
[18:50] talked about that, but we haven't talked
[18:51] about that one. But that was an example
[18:53] of some of the the misinformation that's
[18:55] put out there. again IMF central banks
[18:58] um put out in exactly the sorts of well
[19:00] frankly the sort of the economist the
[19:02] nation the things that people know that
[19:04] people like you are going to be reading
[19:07] basically to make sure that you don't
[19:08] embrace an alternative to the system
[19:10] that you've seen firsthand is broken.
[19:12] Yeah. So I want to encourage all of you
[19:16] Bitcoiners, you know, let's make sure
[19:19] that we spread this information and we
[19:21] don't just spread it uh you know we
[19:23] don't just sing to the choir or lead the
[19:25] choir. We we've got to reach everybody
[19:27] out there and and that we need to really
[19:30] make sure that there's not a new
[19:32] oligarchy, a Bitcoin oligarchy, you
[19:35] know, we don't want to replace a a
[19:38] penthouse suite. We don't want to put
[19:39] put a penthouse suite where we've had uh
[19:42] bankers before. Thank you. Yeah. So,
[19:45] let's all get out there and make sure
[19:47] that Bitcoin truly becomes a
[19:49] democratized, decentralized alternative
[19:52] to the current system that we all know
[19:54] is not serving us.
[20:01] Thank you, John. I want to thank you for
[20:03] your intellectual humility, uh, for
[20:05] being able to take a second look at
[20:07] something, for your experience, uh,
[20:09] through your knowledge. As I say, I
[20:11] don't think there's anyone better in the
[20:12] world to talk about the the specific
[20:14] problem that Bitcoin can solve. Um, so
[20:17] thank you for your message. It's been
[20:18] inspiring to hear. My pleasure. Thank
[20:20] you. Thank you.
