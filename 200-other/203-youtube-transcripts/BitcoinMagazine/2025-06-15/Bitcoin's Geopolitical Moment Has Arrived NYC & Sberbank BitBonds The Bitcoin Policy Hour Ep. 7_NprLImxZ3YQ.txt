[00:00] I think now we can credibly make the
[00:02] case just like the AI community has
[00:03] credibly made the case that Bitcoin does
[00:05] matter and will matter very soon to a
[00:07] lot of these strategic questions that
[00:09] Bitcoin tends to do Bitcoin things.
[00:11] Going from a $2 trillion asset to a $20
[00:13] trillion asset, reach parody with gold
[00:15] is not an implausible scenario in the
[00:18] time horizon of current politicians in
[00:20] the next 2 to four years. That single
[00:22] move right uh in the minds of
[00:24] politicians has all these cascading
[00:26] effects. It then uh magnifies in
[00:29] importance all of these other policy
[00:31] issues, protections for self-custody,
[00:33] the protections for open source, you
[00:35] know, software developers. But if
[00:37] Bitcoin does become like a global
[00:38] digital gold, then these will have
[00:41] massive implications to like which
[00:43] direction do we choose? All right. Uh
[00:45] welcome back to the Bitcoin Policy Hour,
[00:47] a weekly podcast hosted by the Bitcoin
[00:49] Policy Institute. I'm your host, Zack
[00:50] Cohen, an associate with BPI, and I'm
[00:53] joined each week uh by my colleagues,
[00:55] Matthew Pines, uh BPI's executive
[00:57] director, and Zach Shapiro, BPI's head
[01:00] of policy. We're now just three weeks
[01:02] out from the Bitcoin Policy Summit, uh
[01:04] June 25th here in Washington DC. Uh
[01:07] tickets are limited and we expect to
[01:09] sell out. We're going to talk a little
[01:10] bit more about what you can expect
[01:11] there, but uh go ahead, grab your ticket

[01:22] code BTC policy hour 21. Uh Hines, what
[01:26] what are we expecting at the policy
[01:27] summit? I know we we've got some stuff
[01:29] to share. Yes, you know, we've got
[01:31] really uh an exciting lineup of of
[01:34] executive branch officials in particular
[01:35] that I'm um really interested to hear
[01:38] articulate a nuanced view of Bitcoin in
[01:40] particular. Um and you know, we've been
[01:43] rolling out some of those announcements.
[01:44] I think we'll have some more to come.
[01:45] But um just some headliners, right, from
[01:47] my perspective, right? Again, we we're
[01:49] fanboys of of this space, right? Uh so
[01:51] these names are are celebrities in our
[01:53] mind, but um it's important to sort of,
[01:55] you know, foot stop this the
[01:56] significance of some of these these
[01:57] folks that are coming to a Bitcoin
[01:59] specific event talking about policy um
[02:02] inside inside of Washington DC. So we
[02:03] have the SEC commissioner, Hester
[02:05] Pierce. Um she's wonderful. Uh she's
[02:07] been, you know, doing the rounds on a on
[02:09] a number of other uh uh events. I think
[02:11] she's a good um spokesperson for kind of
[02:13] a a different approach towards digital
[02:15] lash. That's um more generally um uh we
[02:18] also have Bo Hines uh and Tyler Williams
[02:21] uh folks that have been on on on again
[02:24] you know kind of stage talking about the
[02:25] administration's approach to the digital
[02:27] assets and kind of the upcoming um kind
[02:29] of policy report that's due for the
[02:31] executive order uh later in July. Um,
[02:34] two individuals though that I think
[02:35] folks maybe are not paying attention to,
[02:38] um, they're a bit more kind of behind
[02:39] the scenes, but they'll be coming to
[02:40] speak at our event is, uh, Bo Hines, uh,
[02:44] sorry, is Michael Helis, uh, who is the
[02:46] the CIA deputy director. Uh, now that's
[02:49] that's unusual, right? You don't
[02:50] normally have the deputy director of the
[02:52] CIA, you know, speak at, um, policy
[02:55] events, uh, let alone a Bitcoin policy
[02:57] event. Um, and I'll be doing a fireside
[02:59] chat with him for almost half an hour.
[03:01] Uh and we're really going to, you know,
[03:02] talk about where does Bitcoin fit into
[03:05] the administration's view of the
[03:07] geopolitical and economic um strategic
[03:09] environment here. There's a lot that is
[03:11] changing uh in that environment. A lot
[03:13] of both like uh US policy shifts uh as
[03:16] well as adversary, you know, reactions
[03:17] and there's an intense competition
[03:19] underway across emerging technology and
[03:21] kind of the economic uh kind of
[03:23] battlefront and and Bitcoin is now
[03:25] emerging as a geopolitical asset uh in
[03:27] that context. And so I think this I I
[03:30] will be very interested and I will be
[03:31] you know trying to uh to uh to tease him
[03:33] out uh on these questions. I think that
[03:35] will be very re very revealing and very
[03:37] um uh you know strategically important
[03:39] to see how someone in position of
[03:41] national leadership inside our
[03:42] intelligence community that doesn't make
[03:44] policy. They advise policy makers on
[03:47] changes that are happening in the world
[03:48] and what might be the consequences or
[03:49] what might be the reactions uh around
[03:52] the world from US from US um you know
[03:54] moves uh on different fronts. So, I am
[03:57] I'm I'm really interested to hear
[03:59] someone like him articulate a view uh
[04:01] about Bitcoin and digital assets in in
[04:03] in the strategic context. Um and then
[04:06] we'll have some other individuals coming
[04:07] from uh again kind of that strategic
[04:09] perspective. We haven't announced their
[04:10] names yet. Um but I think folks that
[04:12] will be um uh increasingly important uh
[04:15] inside the White House and across uh the
[04:18] policy space. Uh and then we're going to
[04:19] have you know uh a really great lineup
[04:21] of of of US senators and
[04:23] representatives. Cynthia Lumis, Tom
[04:26] Emmer, uh Alyssa Sodkin, Jim Justice,
[04:28] Marsha Blackburn, our our good friend
[04:30] Nicholas Beg from Alaska, Warren
[04:32] Davidson, um and a number of other
[04:34] congressmen that that that are looking
[04:35] to attend. And so, uh you know, every
[04:38] year the Bitcoin policy summit has like
[04:40] essentially doubled or tripled in terms
[04:42] of the size and the scale of its um of
[04:44] its impact. And I think this year will
[04:45] be no different. So, we're really
[04:46] looking forward to this being kind of a
[04:48] watershed moment. Um, capping, I think,
[04:51] what has been a very uh, you know,
[04:53] decisive shift in at least the rhetoric
[04:55] and the policy orientation from the from
[04:57] the White House. And I think we really
[04:59] want to focus on what does that mean uh,
[05:02] down the line in terms of the policies
[05:04] that each, you know, sort of arm and leg
[05:06] of the administrative um, machinery uh,
[05:09] can move uh, in a pro bitcoin direction.
[05:11] um and how to do that in a way that you
[05:13] know maximizes the opportunity and
[05:15] minimizes the related risks associated
[05:16] with you know doing something novel
[05:18] right doing something a bit um a bit
[05:20] ambitious here and so we want to sort of
[05:22] chart the course set the agenda um and
[05:25] bring all the right people uh to the
[05:27] table folks maybe from non-traditional
[05:29] um uh you know kind of spaces that don't
[05:31] normally talk about Bitcoin in a serious
[05:32] way. this is like the event to kind of
[05:36] uh pull all of those different threads
[05:37] together, generate uh at least a sense
[05:40] of consensus and uh a call to action um
[05:43] and also drive connections between folks
[05:45] in the government, folks in the policy
[05:47] space, folks that are, you know, um
[05:49] technologists, policy experts and and
[05:51] sort of industry um perspectives to
[05:54] really get like ground truth, right? Um
[05:56] there's lots of conferences that are
[05:58] like, you know, business development
[05:59] conferences or meant to sort of generate
[06:01] memes and headlines. This is a
[06:03] conference designed to actually generate
[06:05] policy action, right? To move the ball
[06:06] down the field. So, uh I think this is
[06:09] this is the event to come to in DC.
[06:11] Again, I'm just sort of shilling it, but
[06:13] uh this is this is going to be a big
[06:14] one. Just to I think situate this for
[06:17] folks a little bit more. I think the
[06:18] most important to me part of what what
[06:20] Matt just said is the sort of how uh
[06:24] distilled this is going to be around the
[06:26] executive branch in particular, right?
[06:27] So, lots of Bitcoin conferences. You're
[06:29] used to having Bitcoin luminaries and
[06:32] macro folks and podcasters on stage. We
[06:34] are keeping that to an absolute minimum
[06:36] at our conference. There will be some of
[06:37] those, but that's not really the focus.
[06:39] Um, and increasingly at big Bitcoin and
[06:41] crypto conferences, you'll see uh
[06:43] members of the legislative branch. Um,
[06:46] for people who are not sort of fully
[06:47] read up on their civics, uh, the United
[06:49] States federal government has three
[06:51] branches. Um, there's the judicial
[06:53] branch, which is not going to speak
[06:55] really at any conference. It's very very
[06:56] rare federal judges will speak about
[06:58] anything. We're not close to the point
[07:00] where they're speaking in public about
[07:02] Bitcoin. We're just trying to make sure
[07:03] they understand it at this point. Uh to
[07:05] be frank, um what people are used to
[07:07] hearing is the legislative branch,
[07:08] that's Congress, so the House of
[07:10] Representatives in the Senate, they make
[07:12] laws. Uh their primary interaction with
[07:14] Bitcoin and with crypto is pandering uh
[07:17] or you know on the Elizabeth Warren side
[07:19] attacking it. But it's it's very
[07:21] rhetorical, right? These are people who
[07:23] want to please their constituents. uh
[07:25] they want to raise money and so mostly
[07:27] what they do is they say nice things
[07:29] about Bitcoin. Some of them understand
[07:31] it better than others. Uh at our summit
[07:33] we're going to have the people that like
[07:34] really understand and care about this as
[07:36] opposed to people that are just
[07:37] rhetorically pro Bitcoin. And then
[07:39] occasionally you get actual legislation
[07:41] that matters in a positive or negative
[07:43] direction for Bitcoin. So the negative
[07:45] direction would be something like
[07:46] Elizabeth Warren's Damla bill which bans
[07:49] sort of the direct use of Bitcoin by
[07:50] labeling everyone as a money
[07:51] transmitter. In the positive side, you
[07:53] have something like the Bitcoin Act,
[07:54] which would uh fund a federal uh SBR.
[07:57] You have the Genius Act on stable coins
[08:00] that's that's, you know, in front of the
[08:01] Senate. Um and then, you know, the
[08:03] market structure bill that's coming
[08:04] later and then the BRCA, which I think
[08:05] we're going to talk about uh later
[08:07] today. But that's really sort of
[08:09] sporadic. When it happens, it's a big
[08:10] deal. Um but they are not the people day
[08:12] in and day out doing policy that is
[08:14] relevant to Bitcoin. And then you have
[08:16] the executive branch, uh which is right
[08:19] now the most interesting. We for the
[08:20] first time ever have a pro- Bitcoin
[08:23] presidential administration where most
[08:25] of the what's in DC called the principal
[08:28] level uh are personally bought in and
[08:30] aligned on Bitcoin and and are starting
[08:32] to like really understand it granularly
[08:34] uh in no small part thanks to uh Matt's
[08:37] work in particular on Bitcoin and
[08:39] geopolitics and what that can mean for
[08:40] the United States. Uh but what you're
[08:42] going to see at our summit that you have
[08:44] not seen at other Bitcoin conferences
[08:46] even that are heavy on politics are the
[08:48] people that actually implement US
[08:50] policy. people that are subject matter
[08:52] experts in their domain, whether that
[08:53] domain is foreign policy, whether that
[08:55] domain is regulation of the markets like
[08:58] the SEC, whether that domain is uh the
[09:00] intelligence community and really
[09:02] thinking strategic thoughts about what's
[09:04] the relationship between the United
[09:06] States and rising powers in a world
[09:08] where we're moving away from just pure
[09:10] dollar hegemony. And um the people who
[09:14] are speaking at our summit, who are in
[09:16] the executive branch, they don't run for
[09:17] office. They're not there to pander to
[09:19] us. They're not there to pander to
[09:20] crypto voters. They don't have voters.
[09:22] Uh they're there to both understand uh
[09:25] what Bitcoin can offer the United States
[09:27] government in terms of, you know, a
[09:29] lever to achieve US aims. Um they're
[09:31] there to share their perspective uh on,
[09:34] you know, how we as a Bitcoin community
[09:36] should think about uh their policy work
[09:38] from the government. And uh I think this
[09:40] is the most important sort of story of
[09:43] Bitcoin policy that isn't being told.
[09:45] And and I don't think well, you know,
[09:47] there have been some folks on this list,
[09:49] especially from the White House, who
[09:50] have made some appearances, I don't
[09:52] think there's been any event that has
[09:54] close to the depth of what the actual
[09:56] policy makers, the people that execute
[09:57] the power of the federal government, um
[10:00] what they think about Bitcoin and
[10:01] getting them in the room with uh folks
[10:04] in industry and folks who really deeply
[10:06] understand the technology and the sort
[10:08] of game theory around its implications.
[10:10] The last point I'll add to that which is
[10:13] um excellent is there's going to be a
[10:16] lot more people in the audience that are
[10:18] almost as important as people on stage.
[10:20] Um and unlike other conferences where
[10:22] there's a lot of people sort of
[10:23] clamoring to get stage time because they
[10:26] want to get attention. They want to
[10:27] pitch their product. They want to you
[10:29] know you know get their name out there.
[10:32] The folks we're inviting to this are you
[10:34] know senior bure senior bureaucrats
[10:36] right? assistant secretaries of blank,
[10:38] right? Deputy under secretaries of
[10:40] blank. Um, you know, directors of
[10:42] various offices, folks of significant
[10:44] administrative and bureaucratic
[10:45] responsibility, most of whom, you know,
[10:47] whose names are, you know, like you
[10:49] could you barely Google them, right?
[10:50] They show up on, you know, some org
[10:52] chart. Um, but those people matter,
[10:54] especially now in an era where the
[10:56] administration at the top has said we
[10:57] want to be pro Bitcoin and everyone else
[10:59] in the in the, you know, the uh the
[11:01] apparatus is okay, well, what does that
[11:02] mean? Right? Like what does that mean
[11:04] for me? What do I do? Do I write a memo?
[11:06] Do I issue an instruction? Do I pull
[11:08] back a regulation? And there's a lot of
[11:10] kind of, you know, inertia in in in the
[11:12] system. And that system was set right in
[11:14] the last four years in a particular
[11:16] direction. And just because the
[11:17] president signs a piece of paper doesn't
[11:20] mean, you know, the whole ship of state
[11:21] like immediately turns. Um, and so this
[11:23] sort of event is meant to kind of move
[11:26] the whole ship of of state in a
[11:27] different direction here. And so it's
[11:30] almost more important to have the folks
[11:31] in the room listening and meeting with
[11:33] each other meeting with professionals
[11:35] from from inside and outside the
[11:36] industry that take the topic of Bitcoin
[11:38] and its intersection with you know
[11:40] national security with energy with AI
[11:43] with human rights like very seriously.
[11:45] Um this isn't you know this was a
[11:46] theoretical conversation that we sort of
[11:48] tried to to catalyze in in in earlier
[11:50] Bitcoin policy summits. It was very I'd
[11:52] say notional. Um you know we were
[11:54] pointing at certain examples but it was
[11:55] trying to just get people to pay
[11:56] attention to be honest. now they're very
[11:59] much paying attention and they want like
[12:01] concrete ideas and they want to work
[12:02] with people that are actually doing
[12:03] things um that are relevant in that
[12:05] space. So it's hard to kind of
[12:07] overestimate like the significance of
[12:09] getting the sort of the machinery to
[12:12] engage with Bitcoin in this way in a
[12:14] pro- Bitcoin way in a way that aligns
[12:16] with our ethos and our values and tries
[12:18] to you know um establish a consistency
[12:21] over time that doesn't just wax and wing
[12:23] with the political cycle. Yeah, that's
[12:24] great. I think, you know, the other key
[12:26] thing to highlight here and and I assume
[12:28] most people who are listening to this
[12:29] are familiar with the annual Bitcoin
[12:31] conference and we'll talk a little bit
[12:33] more about what happened in Vegas this
[12:35] past week. Um that I think you know the
[12:37] key difference here between Vegas and
[12:40] the Bitcoin policy summit was you know
[12:42] there was plenty of politicians in
[12:44] Vegas. There were plenty of people
[12:45] talking about how they're looking at
[12:47] Bitcoin uh folks from you know executive
[12:50] and and legislative. Um, but I think the
[12:54] key sort of difference here as as we're
[12:57] 3 weeks out is that, you know, this is
[13:00] this is where the sort of policy gets
[13:02] charted looking forward, right? Like I
[13:05] think a lot of what we heard last week
[13:06] was, hey, you know, it's been however
[13:08] many months, like five months since the
[13:10] new administration took over. Uh, XYZ
[13:13] things have happened. You know, we're
[13:14] following through on our promises. Um,
[13:17] you know, this is the first time that
[13:19] that uh DC has been sort of decisively
[13:22] pro Bitcoin. Uh, what we're looking
[13:25] forward to at the end of June here is is
[13:28] what happens after that. Um, because a
[13:30] lot of work has been done. Uh, but
[13:32] there's also a lot of work yet to be
[13:33] done. Um, and you know, I think the
[13:36] three of us are are all extremely
[13:37] bullish on on what we might hear uh in
[13:40] DC. uh especially, you know, when those
[13:42] folks get up on stage and they know
[13:44] who's in the audience. They know that
[13:46] there are, you know, staffers uh from
[13:48] the executive agencies, from uh senators
[13:51] and uh congressman offices. Um you know,
[13:55] they want to send a signal to those
[13:57] folks of of hey, this is how the
[13:58] administration looks at this. This is
[13:59] how our agency looks at this. Uh trying
[14:01] to kind of move everybody in the same
[14:03] direction. So, uh really looking forward
[14:05] to that. But do want to touch back here
[14:07] on on what we heard in Vegas. Obviously,
[14:09] the event was was headlined by Vice
[14:12] President JD Vance and there was a
[14:14] little Easter egg in his speech. Uh, so
[14:16] so Pines, can you just sort of I think
[14:19] probably most people have seen this on
[14:20] Twitter. Uh, hopefully, but but what
[14:22] happened during the speech and and what
[14:24] does that kind of indicate for for
[14:26] Bitcoin policy? Yes, it was kind of a
[14:28] bit of an out-of- body experience
[14:30] because I was on the live desk uh, you
[14:32] know, which first of all, by the way,
[14:34] shout out to David Bailey and the
[14:35] Bitcoin conference crew for putting on,
[14:37] you know, remarkable event, right? Those
[14:38] are extremely complicated things to pull
[14:40] off. Um, everyone likes to shout from
[14:42] the peanut gallery, right, and
[14:44] criticize. Um, but just, you know, it
[14:46] was just a very well-run event. There's
[14:48] obviously things that you could improve,
[14:49] but um, just the fact that they were
[14:51] able to feature us, right? BPI was like,
[14:54] um, extremely integrated into the
[14:56] program. We had our, and that's kind of
[14:57] been like the, you know, again, like a
[14:59] um, thing we've been building to, right?
[15:01] like assembling the deepest bench of
[15:02] policy experts, folks that um have
[15:04] measured, credible opinions uh and and
[15:08] analysis on on a wide range of different
[15:10] topics in Bitcoin and be able to kind of
[15:12] like, you know, bring the whole, you
[15:14] know, bench, right, and field them into
[15:15] the, you know, into the play uh and have
[15:18] them essentially on stage driving the
[15:20] conversation, I think is exactly kind of
[15:22] uh what BPI was for. And the fact that,
[15:24] um, you know, they provided a venue for
[15:26] us to kind of feature our expertise was
[15:28] was very welcomed and and and it was a
[15:30] privilege there. So, we were on the live
[15:31] desk uh Zach and I as Vice President um
[15:34] Vance gave his remarks and I say my
[15:37] initial impression as I was listening to
[15:38] it was kind of like me like it was a lot
[15:42] of kind of like written by committee
[15:43] very like generic kind of vague um
[15:47] statements um kind of a bit of patting
[15:49] on the back and somewhat broad stuff
[15:51] about blockchain for health care and I
[15:53] think I think he was losing the room a
[15:55] bit um it wasn't uh it was a bit of a
[15:58] kind of a tepid a tepid speech to a
[16:00] Bitcoin audience. Uh but he's a smart
[16:02] guy and he's he's got those uh polit you
[16:05] know politician instincts. And so I
[16:07] think at the end of his prepared
[16:08] remarks, he sort of took the opportunity
[16:10] to kind of um to riff uh
[16:12] extemporaneously and kind of give his
[16:15] thoughts, right? Give his unfiltered,
[16:17] you know, top of the dome opinions on
[16:19] Bitcoin and and what he cares about. And
[16:21] that to me was a very different speech,
[16:22] right? Almost like two speeches in one,
[16:25] right? And that was the one that I think
[16:26] was the most interesting because he he
[16:28] um you know was kind of being very frank
[16:30] with the audience essentially is saying
[16:32] what what his view of the political
[16:33] balance of Bitcoin is. Um I may disagree
[16:36] with it but it's like important to know
[16:37] that his position is that the perception
[16:39] apparently is that AI is like a more
[16:41] leftleaning sorts of technology domain
[16:43] and Bitcoin is a more right-leaning
[16:44] technology domain. I think we have we
[16:47] have our disagreements on that framing
[16:48] but that's an important you know
[16:50] categorization. And the second most
[16:53] important thing that he he sort of draw
[16:55] drew attention to was this question of
[16:57] Bitcoin strategic significance in the
[16:59] context of a technology race with China
[17:02] and accelerating digital disruptions.
[17:04] And Bitcoin is both a money is both the
[17:06] geopolitical, you know, emerging
[17:08] monetary assets, but it's also a
[17:09] network. It's a network that's embedded
[17:11] into systems of technology that are
[17:12] rapidly changing. And I think he was
[17:15] articulating a view of um uncertainty
[17:17] about how to precisely like link
[17:20] together all these very complicated uh
[17:21] sort of threats, right? They're trying
[17:23] to make they're trying to make a lot of
[17:25] changes to the global system. They're
[17:26] trying to win a strategic competition
[17:28] with China. Um it was a call to action
[17:30] like this has to be two-way
[17:32] conversation. uh can the Bitcoin
[17:34] community come to the table with um you
[17:38] know serious and and justified analysis
[17:40] that that that paints Bitcoin in a in
[17:43] the strategic light that it deserves and
[17:45] articulates a view that the
[17:47] administration can can adopt that
[17:50] integrates Bitcoin into their larger
[17:51] strategic um uh you know plans and
[17:54] objectives. Um, and it was very much a
[17:57] surprise to hear him shout out Bitcoin
[17:59] Policy Institute for doing exactly that
[18:01] type of work and essentially a call for
[18:03] us to do more of that type of work and
[18:05] you know that's what we do. So it was uh
[18:07] wonderful to hear the the vice president
[18:09] essentially specifically name check us
[18:11] and and and our work on this subject and
[18:13] and ask for more, right? You you know
[18:15] the the the the purpose of a think tank
[18:17] is to produce white papers and you know
[18:20] spew that you hope policy makers will
[18:22] will listen to and will use to inform
[18:24] their decisions. And so that was the
[18:25] most validating moment at least I've had
[18:27] in my kind of Bitcoin kind of thinkboy
[18:29] career was to have the vice president
[18:30] essentially recognize the value of what
[18:32] um what BPI is doing uh and say that
[18:35] it's actually of strategic significance
[18:36] to how the administration is going to
[18:37] view Bitcoin. And so we are, you know,
[18:40] certainly factoring that into how we
[18:42] plan the the summit. Uh but more
[18:44] importantly, how we double down on on
[18:46] the research and analysis and engagement
[18:49] um with the administration, right? Um
[18:51] again, this is not supporting the
[18:53] administration's, you know, uh party.
[18:55] It's about supporting the the the the
[18:57] governance of our of our of our
[18:59] political institutions that have the
[19:01] authority to do good or bad things from
[19:03] our perspective relative to Bitcoin. And
[19:05] I think now we have this limited window
[19:07] of opportunity to kind of decisively
[19:09] shift in the most positive direction
[19:11] possible. And so I think we should
[19:13] capitalize on that um uh you know with
[19:15] with elacrity. Satoshi released Bitcoin.
[19:20] The world was forever changed. No one
[19:22] realized it. This is the once in a
[19:25] century opportunity and this is just the
[19:27] beginning. Bitcoin is like digital gold.
[19:30] Do I view Bitcoin in line with the next
[19:32] evolution of humans engineering a better
[19:34] world? I think the story of the past few
[19:38] years is Bitcoin going from a niche
[19:40] interest into a respectable global macro
[19:43] asset. Bitcoin Policy Institute has
[19:46] become a thought leader.
[19:49] [Music]
[19:53] Yeah. I mean, speaking of uh sort of
[19:55] moving quickly here, uh we heard news
[19:58] out of Moscow uh I guess late last week
[20:01] that uh Russia's largest bank will now
[20:04] be issuing something similar to what
[20:06] we're calling a bit bond. Uh there was
[20:08] some bit bond talk also at the
[20:10] conference. Uh so so Pines, what's going
[20:12] on there? Um and you know, I think I do
[20:15] also want to hit on on what Mayor Adams
[20:17] talked about. I know that there was some
[20:19] a series of articles that came out after
[20:20] that talking about how the comp troller
[20:23] basically, you know, was like, "Hey, I'm
[20:25] not going to let, you know, New York's
[20:27] bond holders basically, you know, be at
[20:29] the whims of these volatile
[20:31] cryptocurrencies." But but what was the
[20:33] significance of what Mayor Adams
[20:35] announced, uh, you know, regardless of
[20:37] how the actual politics of that are
[20:39] going to play out? Yeah, I guess I I'll
[20:41] zoom out and say that um the there's
[20:43] ideas in the water now, right? Okay. And
[20:45] so different institutions are picking up
[20:47] these ideas and it starts small starts
[20:49] with sort of you know individual say a
[20:51] Russian bank that decides because they
[20:54] want to provide some sub subset of their
[20:56] investors access to Bitcoin in a way
[20:58] that's controlled right they don't want
[20:59] to have them access to actual physical
[21:00] Bitcoin uh they're going to create kind
[21:03] of a bond structure uh that's sort of
[21:05] indexed uh to to to Bitcoin and that has
[21:08] a certain kind of um uh kind of payoff
[21:11] profile that's maybe like a bit bond.
[21:13] It's not quite like a Bitbond. There's
[21:15] no actual like physical Bitcoin being
[21:16] paid out. It's kind of just a reference
[21:18] mark. Um, but it's like an indication.
[21:20] It's direction of travel, right? That's
[21:22] now being permitted by the authorities.
[21:23] Russia has done, you know, a few kind of
[21:25] very halting moves and kind of trying to
[21:27] integrate Bitcoin into some of their
[21:28] financial markets, but it's been very
[21:30] much like a controlled regulated process
[21:31] and very much only for like accredited
[21:33] investors and certainly they're not
[21:35] going to allow people like, you know,
[21:36] physically hold large large quantities
[21:38] of Bitcoin or to transact um without
[21:40] going through state institutions. So
[21:42] that was a very interesting test case
[21:44] and it certainly is something that is um
[21:45] you know a hint of where the strategic
[21:48] you know lines are being redrawn around
[21:49] Bitcoin's relevance to the global
[21:51] system. So, I think folks in the White
[21:53] House should pay pay very close
[21:54] attention to what banks like Spare Bank
[21:56] are doing here, right? There's it's
[21:57] again it's a first step, but it's a it's
[21:59] a clue for where they might be going.
[22:01] And then the mayor of New York
[22:02] announcing bit bonds, right? Again, kind
[22:03] of like uh an idea that that BPI kind of
[22:06] helped kind of amplify had been been
[22:08] introduced in Bitcoin space for for a
[22:10] while now, but we worked with Andrew
[22:11] Hones to kind of solidify a certain
[22:13] policy um prescription of how that could
[22:15] how that could be implemented. And we
[22:16] wrote a white white paper and Andrew
[22:18] Hones gave a great presentation at our
[22:19] last event. So now that this idea is out
[22:21] there and you know aspiring politicians
[22:23] that want to get attention from the
[22:24] Bitcoin community, it's like okay, this
[22:26] is like a ma a matchup between an
[22:28] interesting policy idea that's kind of
[22:30] on the cutting edge and an aspiring
[22:32] politician who wants to attract the
[22:33] attention and support of Bitcoiners. And
[22:35] so this is kind of the natural dynamic I
[22:36] think we're seeing play out here. Um
[22:38] where the New York City, you know,
[22:39] general obligation bond like is a is a
[22:42] is a vehicle potentially to to do a kind
[22:44] of a bit bond um like example. Now, how
[22:46] that gets implemented over the political
[22:48] calendar inside New York City, they're
[22:49] going through a mayoral race, right? So,
[22:51] all this is ultimately going to be
[22:52] downstream of the results of that
[22:54] election. Um, but now that this is sort
[22:56] of the doors open, other mayors in other
[22:58] cities are now going to be asking the
[22:59] question, well, does this make sense to
[23:00] me? Should I ask my senior finance team
[23:03] to like explore this and and then you
[23:05] start this ball rolling? Yeah. Yeah.
[23:08] Zach, a question to you here. We've been
[23:10] working on a state legislation toolkit
[23:12] and you know one sort of major tenant of
[23:14] that is is the bit bonds proposal. Um do
[23:17] you see this being of sort of increasing
[23:20] interest to state governments u
[23:22] municipalities? Um what are sort of the
[23:25] the the selling points for folks like
[23:27] that? Uh what you know and you can touch
[23:29] back on on what Mayor Adams talked about
[23:30] as well if you Yeah. If sorry, I think I
[23:32] want to touch back on just Vegas in
[23:34] general uh for a minute because I think
[23:36] we collectively had a sort of unique
[23:39] experience there that that we can share.
[23:41] Um I think every every year the Bitcoin
[23:44] conference in particular, right? It's
[23:45] this sort of massive thing. Um there are
[23:47] sort of two things that go on. There is
[23:50] the public facing part of the conference
[23:52] uh which is you know the speeches and
[23:55] the sponsors and the sort of hoopla and
[23:58] the big parties and that's one very
[24:01] important thing to pay attention to
[24:03] because it gives you a theme of where we
[24:05] are in the Bitcoin story and my thesis
[24:09] on this is that every cycle thinks it's
[24:11] about the thing that the next cycle is
[24:14] about. Um, so you know, if you remember
[24:16] back to 2021, everyone used the term
[24:19] institutional adoption all the time and
[24:20] the institutions are coming and the
[24:22] early institutions were right. That was
[24:23] Michael Sailor, that was Tesla. Um, but
[24:26] those were mostly symbolic and really
[24:29] sort of setting the conceptual
[24:31] groundwork for what really happened this
[24:34] cycle where undeniably if you watched
[24:36] the speeches and you paid attention to
[24:38] the themes of this summit, it's the
[24:39] institutions are here, right? the
[24:41] institutions, everything from sovereign
[24:43] wealth funds to public companies to
[24:46] Bitcoin treasury plays to you name it.
[24:49] Uh the institutions were there and they
[24:50] were walking around the the whale room
[24:52] and they were giving speeches and the
[24:54] major investment banks are in and Wall
[24:55] Street likes it and um in this cycle we
[24:59] talk a lot about nation state adoption
[25:01] and game theory and we are seeing the
[25:03] early innings of that. We're seeing the
[25:04] conceptual groundwork for that being
[25:07] laid with the the strategic Bitcoin
[25:08] reserve executive order and some public
[25:11] investment uh by foreign governments and
[25:13] hopefully some investment by the United
[25:15] States government. But it's the early
[25:16] innings in what I would guess will be
[25:19] fully in bloom by the 2028 cycle. Um,
[25:23] and so there was just a really
[25:24] interesting energy sort of on the floor
[25:27] of the conference this year in the
[25:28] speeches of the big money is here,
[25:31] Tradfi is here, the nation states are
[25:34] coming somewhere around the corner and
[25:36] Bitcoin is playing out on this much
[25:39] larger stage than it ever has before.
[25:41] Okay, so that's the sort of like main
[25:43] face of the conference, but there's
[25:45] always and I think particularly this
[25:47] year was sort of the behindthe-scenes
[25:49] inside game at the Bitcoin conference as
[25:51] well. And I remember I took this class
[25:53] in in college on on architecture uh
[25:55] where they compared uh British and
[25:58] French country houses and and British
[26:00] country houses are all about sort of
[26:01] recreating nature in the garden and
[26:03] comfort and French country houses are
[26:05] all about like imposing strict order on
[26:06] nature. They have these axial gardens
[26:08] but but one detail about French country
[26:10] houses and I'll I'll tell you the
[26:11] relevance in a second that always struck
[26:13] me was the interior of like the French
[26:16] estates would be arranged from bigger to
[26:18] smaller rooms. And if you were invited
[26:20] to visit one of these houses, you knew
[26:22] how important you were because you would
[26:24] be invited further into the interior in
[26:27] smaller rooms. And not something he
[26:30] talks about a lot, but this is something
[26:31] that like David Bailey is really really
[26:34] good at and arranging these sort of
[26:36] rooms within rooms. And there is
[26:38] absolutely an inside game uh at these
[26:41] conferences of people meeting each other
[26:43] and and making policy. And while the
[26:46] speeches and the main tenor of the
[26:48] conference is often times backward
[26:50] looking, it's it's a celebration of
[26:51] here's where we are from the
[26:53] politicians. It's look what we've done
[26:54] for you over the past few months. These
[26:57] sort of inside rooms, right, these
[26:59] smaller events, some of them official,
[27:00] some of them nonofficial. There are
[27:02] conversations that are happening that
[27:03] will shape the future of Bitcoin. And
[27:06] the last part of Vance's speech, which
[27:09] sounded a lot like this podcast, right,
[27:12] in that he was talking about what
[27:14] Bitcoin means in an AGI world, you know,
[27:16] Bitcoin could be a counterbalance and we
[27:18] shouldn't just treat it as a as a
[27:19] leftright partisan thing where he's
[27:20] talking about the geopolitical um you
[27:23] know, significance of Bitcoin with the
[27:25] rise of China. Um, some of that, you
[27:28] know, I'm not talking out of of school
[27:30] because this, but like came from a
[27:32] literally a room within a room
[27:34] conversation that that Pines had with a
[27:36] couple of folks including the vice
[27:37] president staff and and like that stuff
[27:40] is all really cool and and just to go
[27:42] back to our summit, uh, what I'm really
[27:44] excited about at the end of this month
[27:45] in DC is we are going to have an entire
[27:48] conference that I think will feel like
[27:50] the rooms within rooms in Vegas. But I I
[27:53] I think one thing for listeners today is
[27:55] like what absolutely you can learn a lot
[27:57] by what you see from the live stream
[27:59] from the Vegas conference. But you have
[28:02] to imagine all of those people who are
[28:04] speaking are also there speaking with
[28:06] each other and there are all sorts of
[28:08] different side conversations where when
[28:11] you get the industry leaders, the
[28:13] government officials from different
[28:14] branches of government uh the analysts
[28:17] of all different types together um the
[28:19] alchemy that comes out of that in terms
[28:21] of like where this is all headed gets
[28:24] baked in like a really exciting way. Um,
[28:27] so one of the announcements we got uh is
[28:30] about bib bonds from from the mayor of
[28:32] New York. And I I think there's some
[28:33] interesting inside baseball there that
[28:35] probably we can't talk about on this
[28:36] podcast, but um it raises the question
[28:39] of okay, bit bonds, who who are they
[28:42] good for? And I think uh the truth is we
[28:44] don't know the answer for that yet,
[28:47] right? Really zooming out, what we know
[28:49] about Bitcoin so far and what's
[28:51] uncontroversial now is that Bitcoin is
[28:53] incredible collateral. Um then the next
[28:56] question is what do you do with it? And
[28:58] people are trying to do all sorts of
[28:59] stuff with it. Michael Sailor is using
[29:01] it in a certain way. The other treasury
[29:03] companies are using it in other ways.
[29:04] Nation states are trying to use it as a
[29:07] reserve asset. But then there's this and
[29:09] then there are all sorts of interesting
[29:11] ways that people are trying to use
[29:12] Bitcoin as in conjunction with other
[29:14] types of collateral or assets based on
[29:16] its unique properties and liquidity
[29:18] profile. But but one of these
[29:19] subcategories is integrating Bitcoin
[29:22] into fiat debt. Right? the whole sort of
[29:24] larger concept of a bit bond. Um, and
[29:27] for the United States and the federal
[29:30] before we get to the states, I mean,
[29:31] this is a really interesting way to sort
[29:33] of seed the strategic Bitcoin reserve
[29:35] and create different types of demand for
[29:38] US debt. But maybe the most interesting
[29:41] version of this is at the state and
[29:43] local level where you can do tax-free
[29:44] municipal bonds. And if it's done well,
[29:47] definitely lawyers will argue back and
[29:48] forth about this, but if you can create
[29:50] tax-free upside exposure to Bitcoin,
[29:54] which is sort of the the heart of this
[29:56] from a policy perspective, you can
[29:58] create an enormous amount of demand for
[30:01] these bonds, right? An enormous amount
[30:04] uh which levels the playing field a
[30:06] little bit between states and
[30:08] municipalities on the one end, the
[30:09] federal government on the other. The US
[30:10] federal government gets to issue T
[30:12] bills, right? That's the risk-free
[30:14] asset. There's a huge amount of demand
[30:15] for that. There's a huge amount of
[30:16] liquidity and it allows us to run
[30:19] incredible deficits and it allows people
[30:22] to get wacky theories like MMT that it
[30:24] just doesn't matter. Like money is this
[30:26] abstract principle we don't need to
[30:27] treat seriously. Right? That's how
[30:29] powerful the T bill is. when you now
[30:32] introduce a state and local instrument
[30:34] that it doesn't have the same power as
[30:37] the sort of full faith and credit of the
[30:38] United States government which gets to
[30:40] print the world reserve asset but it
[30:42] does give you perhaps tax-free exposure
[30:44] to Bitcoin.
[30:46] What power does that give especially the
[30:49] first states and municipalities to
[30:51] embrace this right that that don't have
[30:54] to compete with other similar offerings
[30:55] and get to experiment with you know what
[30:58] versions of this what sort of interest
[31:00] rates what reserve requirements how much
[31:02] Bitcoin exposure etc etc um they are
[31:05] going to be able to pull from the future
[31:07] and invest in themselves in an
[31:10] incredibly potent way so to preview one
[31:13] of the things we're going to be
[31:14] releasing over the next couple weeks we
[31:16] have the state toolkit. There's a
[31:17] lengthy section in it uh setting out
[31:20] language model language for how states
[31:22] can adopt Bitcoin bit bonds if they so
[31:25] choose. But uh I think the answer is
[31:27] specifically because of the Bitcoin
[31:29] upside piece. Specifically because uh
[31:31] you know of the special treatment that
[31:32] like MUN bonds get. This is a
[31:35] unbelievably powerful opportunity
[31:37] specifically for state and local
[31:39] governments that can't print money and
[31:42] that can't borrow ad infinite item
[31:44] because they control the world reserve
[31:45] currency. Man, when Zach goes on his
[31:48] soloquates, just sit back and listen.
[31:50] Um, I do want to I did want to foot stop
[31:52] one point that he brought up and and
[31:53] kind of the the again kind of the the
[31:56] vibe, right? And kind of the different
[31:57] levels of conversation at at at the
[31:59] Vegas conference. And um, you know,
[32:01] Bitcoin is a is a weird thing, right?
[32:03] Like a Bitcoin conference. You're like,
[32:05] "Oh, it's an industry conference. It
[32:06] must be like people coming with their
[32:08] like, you know, to try to get business
[32:10] deals and sell products." And there's
[32:11] like a lot of that. That's like kind of
[32:12] what the conference, you know, most of
[32:14] the physical space is like dedicated to
[32:16] like, you know, people going up on stage
[32:18] and sort of spewing and then people
[32:19] having booths to like sell stuff and
[32:21] then people having parties to have fun.
[32:23] Um, but Bitcoin is kind of this, it's
[32:25] not like a normal industry, right? It's
[32:27] this sort of fastchanging
[32:29] um global monetary movement in a sense,
[32:33] right? It's kind of like this mind virus
[32:35] that is is spread person to person. And
[32:37] it it has the same sort of dynamics on,
[32:39] you know, the average pleb as it does on
[32:41] like the on on the average national
[32:42] leader, right? And they're all trying to
[32:45] understand what's happening here.
[32:46] There's no master planner. There's no
[32:48] like, you know, I think there's rooms
[32:49] within rooms, but I at least my
[32:51] perspective, there's no one with like
[32:52] the master plan. There's no like grand
[32:55] design. It's like fractal chaos and sort
[32:57] of self-organized
[32:59] um you know kind of uh mutual um kind of
[33:02] convergence uh at every scale. And so
[33:05] there's a lot of contingency involved in
[33:08] this. And there's also I think a lot of
[33:10] um you know individual personalities
[33:13] associated with kind of these these like
[33:14] hinge moments right of like where do
[33:16] things move and how do people engage and
[33:18] and what do they think about Bitcoin?
[33:20] Like I think you know there's been a lot
[33:22] written about the kind of politics of
[33:23] Bitcoin, right? the politics of of of of
[33:26] Bitcoiners engaging in the political
[33:28] system. That's certainly been like a
[33:30] major story um since 2024. I think it
[33:32] obviously had a material effect on the
[33:34] results of the election. And I think
[33:35] that has then dominated I think a lot of
[33:37] the kind of the um resulting kind of
[33:40] digestion of Bitcoin by like call like
[33:43] the latently hostile kind of media
[33:45] apparatus, right? That's like uh trying
[33:48] to understand this new phenomena and
[33:50] like understand its political veilance.
[33:51] Um, but there's also, I think, like that
[33:54] gets a lot of the attention, right?
[33:56] Certainly like, oh, you know, it's like
[33:57] the headline at my Wall Street Journal
[33:58] is like, you know, Bitcoin goes all in
[34:00] on MAGA, right? Um, well, one like
[34:02] Bitcoin is not like a corporation.
[34:04] Bitcoin doesn't have like a single, you
[34:06] know, board of directors that like
[34:08] decides a political, you know, uh,
[34:09] orientation. There's like individual
[34:11] Bitcoiners who have decided to engage in
[34:13] a certain way in the political process
[34:14] with some success. Um, but there's a lot
[34:16] of Bitcoiners that disagree with that,
[34:17] right? You know, sort of vehemently. Um,
[34:20] and that's the beauty of Bitcoin, right?
[34:22] There's no there is no like, you know,
[34:24] red or blue uh or pink or whatever flag
[34:27] on Bitcoin. There's just orange, right?
[34:29] Um, but it is it is it is anchoring in
[34:32] now in these different parts of the
[34:34] political economy. Some are some of the
[34:35] most visible, right, which is
[34:36] politicians giving speeches. But I think
[34:39] what I'm most interested now in in our
[34:41] summit in later in in June is how does
[34:44] that how does that align with, you know,
[34:47] folks that view their strategic
[34:48] orientation to responsibilities for for
[34:50] the country itself, right? And there are
[34:53] politicians, right, that, you know,
[34:55] oftentimes straddle the difference
[34:56] between, you know, just kind of raising
[34:58] money and actually trying to like solve
[35:00] harder problems for America, right? And
[35:02] actually like do good things, quote
[35:03] unquote, right? Um, again, like people's
[35:05] motives are always mixed, right? There's
[35:06] never such thing as like a pure-hearted
[35:08] politician here. Um, but you have to
[35:11] approach the person, you know, where
[35:12] they are. And Bitcoin is a complicated
[35:14] thing. And Bitcoin is something that
[35:16] Bitcoiners think about all the time.
[35:17] It's like we have a whole think tank.
[35:19] Our jobs are to write and think about
[35:20] Bitcoin. The vast majority of people
[35:22] that we're talking to in politics think
[35:24] about Bitcoin like 1% of their life,
[35:26] right? At most. And so how they engage
[35:29] with Bitcoin in that 1% of their life,
[35:31] right? Like matters a lot. If it's like,
[35:33] oh, a bunch of rich people want to do
[35:35] want want to throw money at me and have
[35:37] me say positive things about Bitcoin,
[35:39] that's going to color their impression
[35:40] about the like actual strategic
[35:42] significance of Bitcoin. And so, while I
[35:44] think there's been a lot of political
[35:45] success in engaging in in the system,
[35:48] you know, not necessarily normatively,
[35:50] just like objectively, uh, it's been
[35:53] successful. Um, it's kind of thin,
[35:56] right? It's like just because you get so
[35:57] like a a political ally because of
[35:59] campaign contributions, like those are
[36:01] fair weather friends, right? Those
[36:03] people come and go. Do they actually get
[36:04] it? Do they understand it? Do they care
[36:06] about it? Does it deeply align with
[36:07] their sense of of of what they of what
[36:10] they want to accomplish in the world and
[36:11] the instruments of power that they want
[36:13] to wield? And I say like BPI's whole
[36:16] mission is to actually, you know, argue
[36:18] analytically, not like politically. Just
[36:20] say Bitcoin is a very significant thing
[36:22] and it's on its inflection point. And
[36:24] there's lots of inflection points
[36:25] coming. We're in this era of inflection
[36:26] points and this is just one among many
[36:29] um that are going to like land on the
[36:30] doorstep of these policy makers
[36:32] potentially soon, right? Like when you
[36:35] know a lot of focus is on is on AI.
[36:36] We've talked about some podcasts like
[36:38] the fact that is there a reasonable
[36:40] forecast that that say that we could
[36:42] have AGI in say two to four years that's
[36:45] in the time horizon of like a current
[36:46] serving politician, right? They can't
[36:48] just kick that to some future, you know,
[36:50] politician that's gonna or some, you
[36:52] know, uh executive that's going to hold
[36:53] that job. it's now like in their near
[36:56] horizon, right? They have to care about
[36:58] it. It's going to matter to them. And I
[36:59] think Bitcoin, you know, it's like
[37:02] there's that sort of subtle shift,
[37:03] right? When it's like a far future
[37:04] hypothetical thing that Bitcoin could
[37:06] become geopolitically important, it's
[37:08] like, oh, that's a curious like bar
[37:10] conversation, but it's not relevant to
[37:11] my immediate job, right? I think now we
[37:14] can credibly make the case just like the
[37:16] AI community has credibly made the case
[37:17] that Bitcoin does matter and will matter
[37:19] very soon to a lot of these strategic
[37:21] questions that Bitcoin tends to do
[37:23] Bitcoin things. Going from a $2 trillion
[37:25] asset to a $20 trillion asset and reach
[37:27] parody with gold is not an implausible
[37:30] scenario in the time horizon of current
[37:32] politicians in the next two to four
[37:34] years. That seems like a crazy scenario
[37:36] for most people, but it's not like an
[37:39] implausible scenario to have that type
[37:41] of radical price movement. If as Zach
[37:43] says we are kind of setting the
[37:44] conceptual predicate now for Bitcoin to
[37:46] become a geopolitical asset, what that
[37:48] means is that sovereign pools of capital
[37:49] will hold material allocations to
[37:51] Bitcoin and that you know you know
[37:54] doesn't require a whole lot of actual
[37:55] capital coming into Bitcoin to move it
[37:58] you know trillions of dollars and and
[38:00] that has strategic significance and so
[38:01] like you know we we get kind of in the
[38:02] weeds on a lot of things but like that
[38:04] single move right uh in the minds of
[38:07] politicians has all these cascading you
[38:09] know um uh effects and to maybe tee up
[38:12] the next conversation. It then uh
[38:15] magnifies in importance all of these
[38:17] other policy issues, right? Like you
[38:20] know the uh protections for self-
[38:22] custody, the protections for open
[38:24] source, you know, software developers,
[38:26] you know, these are kind of um niche
[38:29] issues quote unquote right in kind of
[38:30] the the digital assets ecosystem. But if
[38:33] Bitcoin does become like a global
[38:35] digital gold, then these will have
[38:37] massive implications to like which
[38:39] direction do we choose, right? there's
[38:41] going to be a path dependency here. Um,
[38:43] and and I think we should take take a
[38:46] close uh look and and and think very
[38:49] hard about what what we're prioritizing
[38:51] in the policy process, right? What will
[38:53] matter in two or three four years
[38:55] looking back on it now? Like will stable
[38:58] coins are important. Market structure is
[39:00] important. getting the United States on
[39:02] the right side of this like once in a
[39:04] generation, once maybe in a millennia
[39:06] like monetization event of a of of a new
[39:08] digital asset
[39:10] maybe more important, right? Making sure
[39:12] that like the ethos of Bitcoin and the
[39:16] view that we have the relationship
[39:18] between the state and soci and and
[39:19] society and individuals when it comes to
[39:21] open source software and peer-to-peer
[39:24] transactions is like preserved if not
[39:26] amplified along that trajectory. Um, and
[39:30] so the stakes are very high and the the
[39:33] time pressure is pretty acute
[39:37] and hence why we're doing the Bitcoin
[39:38] policy hour that JD Vance has been
[39:40] listening to. Right. Maybe.
[39:43] Okay. And why we need the BRCA, right?
[39:46] Exactly. So, let's let's dig into the
[39:48] BRCA. uh the blockchain regulatory
[39:50] certainty act uh that was I think
[39:53] introduced or reintroduced by uh whip
[39:55] Tom Emmer and Richie Torres a couple
[39:58] weeks ago. Um Zach, what is the BRCA and
[40:03] um why have we sort of put our weight uh
[40:06] behind this? Yeah. Um there are quite a
[40:08] few policy areas we care about at BPI.
[40:12] Uh we recently released our what we've
[40:14] been calling our our policy manifesto
[40:15] but it's our our 2025 policy framework
[40:17] which is really sort of a comprehensive
[40:19] list of what we care about in Bitcoin
[40:22] policy, why and what our specific
[40:24] suggestions are and folks should
[40:25] definitely read that for sort of the
[40:27] overview and and we're going to talk
[40:28] about all of that stuff at our summit.
[40:30] There are two issues in particular we've
[40:33] really been focused on though, right?
[40:35] There there are two sort of uh first
[40:37] among equals. Um and both of them relate
[40:40] to the point that that Matt was just
[40:41] making about okay if if you believe as
[40:44] most people listening to this podcast
[40:46] will believe that this is a I mean once
[40:48] in a millennia might be generous, right?
[40:51] It was it's been I several millennia
[40:53] since gold was monetized since we got
[40:54] that kind of new base asset. Maybe you
[40:56] count fiat, who knows? Um, but this is a
[40:59] really really rare moment in time where
[41:01] Bitcoin is monetizing. It's really
[41:03] important that we get this right. And
[41:05] the rais debt of BPI in particular is
[41:09] that we all happen to be born and live
[41:12] in the maybe waning maybe not global
[41:16] superpower which is going to play an
[41:18] outsized role in what happens when
[41:21] Bitcoin becomes an important
[41:23] geopolitical issue. And we can get this
[41:26] right. Visav Bitcoin. We can get this
[41:29] right visav America or we can get it
[41:32] wrong. And when I think about the two
[41:34] most important things that are really
[41:36] important to get right and not wrong,
[41:38] one is what orientation does the United
[41:41] States have to Bitcoin the asset? And so
[41:42] that's why we've been so focused on the
[41:44] strategic Bitcoin reserve. It's not, as
[41:46] our critics will say, just about pumping
[41:47] our bags. Our bags are doing great. Um
[41:50] that's not the problem. uh it's is the
[41:52] United States going to get this right in
[41:54] a way that preserves the value of the
[41:56] dollar and preserves our purchasing
[41:57] power and uh avoids sort of global
[42:00] economic catastrophe with a some sort of
[42:03] sovereign debt issue. The other issue,
[42:06] and this one's much scarier, and the one
[42:08] that I personally have been super
[42:10] focused on, is there is a really novel
[42:14] aspect of Bitcoin the technology, which
[42:16] is that it's peer-to-peer. And our laws
[42:20] were by and large all written, the
[42:23] important laws before such a thing
[42:25] existed, before you could do any kind of
[42:27] literal peer-to-peer electronic payment.
[42:29] And so we have an old set of laws that
[42:31] are facing this new technology. And
[42:34] there are basically two options here. We
[42:37] could either change the laws and
[42:39] regulations to deal with the fact that
[42:41] this new technology exists, which is
[42:43] what the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty
[42:45] Act does, or we could use the old laws,
[42:50] sort of twist them into a pretzel, and
[42:52] use it to try and fight our hardest a
[42:56] losing battle against the existence of
[42:58] this new technology, which is what's
[43:00] happening in the samurai wallet and
[43:01] tornado cash cases, right? and and
[43:03] specifically the the like issue here is
[43:07] with peer-to-peer technology there's no
[43:08] financial intermediary
[43:10] and our laws presume that there is a
[43:14] financial intermediary that should be
[43:15] regulated and so either we need to say
[43:18] in law what those intermediaries are in
[43:21] the new world and where they exist and
[43:23] the blockchain regulator certainty act
[43:25] uh is a fix to that problem it draws
[43:27] this important line between custodial
[43:28] and non-custodial technology and it says
[43:30] in the context of digital assets
[43:32] including Bitcoin, a money service
[43:34] business, which is our word. Other
[43:36] countries talk about virtual assets,
[43:38] service providers or different concepts,
[43:39] but our regulated financial institutions
[43:42] are any kind of service or business that
[43:45] custody or controls user funds, right?
[43:47] That you entrust with your Bitcoin that
[43:49] are able to control your Bitcoin. Um,
[43:51] and then everything short of that is
[43:53] software. And that's a very reasonable
[43:56] place to draw the line and a really
[43:58] important step forward. It doesn't fix
[43:59] everything. There there are interesting
[44:01] questions that remain about federated
[44:03] networks in particular that like I would
[44:05] love to see sort of fleshed out a little
[44:06] bit but this is a really important step
[44:08] in the right direction. The other
[44:11] approach uh to put a finer point on it
[44:13] is what's happening in in Simon and
[44:15] Tornado Cashache which is to say huh we
[44:17] don't really see this financial
[44:19] intermediary but this technology is kind
[44:21] of doing this code is kind of doing what
[44:24] those institutions would do and so let's
[44:27] just treat the people that create that
[44:28] code. Um and and by the way the more
[44:31] I've thought about this this is not a an
[44:33] issue that's going to be totally unique
[44:34] to Bitcoin and crypto. Um, one of my law
[44:37] school roommates has has actually
[44:38] written a lot about sort of how we we're
[44:39] going to regulate AI and self-driving
[44:41] cars and where the liability should sit
[44:43] there and and when you have code doing
[44:45] things that people used to do, right?
[44:47] That's sort of the broader lens on this
[44:49] problem and society does need to face
[44:51] that. But what I can I'm not an expert
[44:53] in that stuff. You know, I am sort of
[44:54] now an expert in this issue specific to
[44:57] Bitcoin and crypto. And it just will be
[45:00] a disaster to go the wrong way on that
[45:02] question and try and hold software
[45:05] developers accountable. It'll be a
[45:07] disaster in terms of the US
[45:08] Constitution. It'll undermine the First
[45:09] Amendment. It'll be a disaster in that
[45:11] it's an attempted ban that's not going
[45:13] to work on Bitcoin and crypto. If you
[45:15] hear that we're going to regulate
[45:16] non-custodial tech as money
[45:18] transmitters, you should just reorient
[45:20] that in your head to, oh, I'm trying to
[45:21] ban Bitcoin because I don't understand
[45:22] it or don't like it, that's what that
[45:24] means. Um, and so in the Samurai Wild
[45:27] case, and maybe we've talked about a
[45:28] little bit of the recent details, but
[45:29] that's, you know, that's not going
[45:31] great. But even if we win that case, uh,
[45:33] we've averted disaster, but that's a
[45:35] temporary fix. the door is still open
[45:38] specifically to people that do not like
[45:39] Bitcoin and want to ban it to use this
[45:42] moment of ambiguity, this limited moment
[45:44] in time before the law figures out what
[45:46] to do with non-custodial peer-to-peer
[45:48] technology. They can use that as a
[45:50] weapon against us and the Blockchain
[45:51] Regulatory Certainly Act, which it's
[45:53] amazing that this was again reintroduced
[45:54] on a bipartisan basis, including with
[45:56] Richie Torres, who's a Democratic
[45:58] rockstar from New York City. We love
[45:59] Richie Torres. Um, this is a good,
[46:03] smart, non-political, enduring fix to
[46:06] the problem that will last even if you
[46:09] know the Trump folks lose the next time
[46:12] around and we have a Democratic
[46:13] president, the BRCA will be the shield
[46:15] that we will really need in that moment.
[46:17] And so aside from the SPR, which is
[46:20] really about us pressing our advantage
[46:22] and and getting into it, you know, the
[46:24] best position we can, this is the other
[46:25] issue that is incredibly time-sensitive
[46:28] and where I feel like we at PPI are
[46:30] uniquely in a position to prosecute this
[46:33] case and we're playing for all the
[46:35] marbles. Yeah. The one point I would add
[46:37] to that is um it's not just a values
[46:40] question and not just a question about
[46:41] whether Americans will be able to, you
[46:43] know, participate in in these um
[46:45] innovations. Um but like where those
[46:48] will will take place, right? Um I think
[46:50] um Matt Coralo who's been, you know,
[46:52] leading the charge on on on on this
[46:54] stuff, you know, I always pointed out,
[46:56] right, like developers are not going to
[46:57] take legal risk here. And so, you know,
[47:01] it's very plausible that you would see
[47:03] all the innovation that's happening on
[47:04] layer 2s with lightning network move
[47:07] offshore and Americans get blocked from
[47:09] accessing it. And so you could have a
[47:12] situation where there like a strategic
[47:13] contradiction here between the United
[47:15] States saying we want to be the crypto
[47:16] capital of the world. We want to be the
[47:17] America's Bitcoin superpower and yet
[47:20] like the fundamental premise of the
[47:21] technology because of you know arcane
[47:24] interpretations of you know pre-digital
[47:27] laws push all of that offshore. Um and
[47:31] you know is a massive W for the
[47:33] anti-crypto army right. And so I think
[47:35] there's a lot of folks in Bitcoin that
[47:37] think we won quote unquote, right? Like
[47:39] number go up, government's going to pump
[47:41] our bags. Like what are you doing
[47:43] talking about this sort of acronym soup
[47:46] of legislation and why it's important?
[47:49] Um like this is really really critical.
[47:51] Like you could wake up in a world even
[47:52] in Trump administration where these
[47:55] things that Bitcoiners are you know very
[47:57] very excited about um all of a sudden
[48:00] you can't use right. uh and and that's
[48:03] in a favorable, you know, political
[48:05] environment, let alone in a in an
[48:06] unfavorable political environment where
[48:08] uh you know, America likes to go
[48:10] overseas and and exert a a sort of extr
[48:12] territorial jurisdiction, uh and try to
[48:15] even shut down the sorts of services
[48:17] around the world, right? and get kind of
[48:19] you know the kind of G20 there's a whole
[48:21] you know the whole fattif kind of
[48:22] virtual asset service service provider
[48:24] is meant to kind of kind of you know was
[48:26] was oriented in a certain way over the
[48:28] course of my administration to kind of
[48:29] choke out these sorts of um tools around
[48:32] the world and really lock down a kind of
[48:34] very centralized digital ecosystem um
[48:36] and so there's a there's still a very
[48:38] very significant fight um here and I
[48:41] would just say that the political
[48:42] economy unfortunately for the digital
[48:44] assets you know policy you know world
[48:46] inside see is like stable coins are like
[48:50] were seen as relatively simple, you
[48:52] know, clean, like get those done. Even
[48:54] though there was some issues there,
[48:55] they're close to being done apparently,
[48:57] although, you know, it's not a done
[48:59] deal. And then there's just kind of like
[49:01] the shibilith that market structures
[49:02] next because everyone has invested the
[49:04] last three or four years in trying to
[49:06] like write rules for defining what like
[49:08] a commodity versus a crypto asset
[49:10] security versus a utility token, etc.
[49:13] is. And that's important, but that
[49:14] really matters mostly to like the
[49:16] Coinbases and the ACCZs of the world um
[49:19] that want to have like, you know,
[49:20] lightweight regulation, sandboxes, they
[49:22] won't have to, you know, file this extra
[49:24] paperwork. They want to have um you
[49:25] know, certain disclosures. Um but for
[49:27] the average user that wants to have the
[49:29] promise of of Bitcoin in particular in
[49:31] layer 2 technologies, those are not
[49:34] prioritized, right, at all, right?
[49:35] Right? If you look at the priorities,
[49:36] stable coins and market structure,
[49:38] Bitcoin is like a distant third with
[49:40] maybe the SPR coming down the line and
[49:42] then only in the last like I'd say week
[49:44] or two has there been kind of like a you
[49:46] know a mini ground swell that we're
[49:48] trying to help reinforce for things like
[49:50] the critical line in the sand here which
[49:51] is enforcing uh in law uh a definition
[49:55] that that clearly protects non-custodial
[49:58] tools right that are not defined as
[49:59] money service businesses like that
[50:01] matters much more like the the
[50:03] priorities in DC are like inverted
[50:05] inverted from from like dramatically
[50:07] inverted, right? Like if you were going
[50:08] to like, okay, clean sheet of paper,
[50:10] what do we do first? I would almost say
[50:12] blockchain regulatory certainty act
[50:13] first, then Bitcoin reserve, then stable
[50:16] coins, and then market structure, right?
[50:18] We've got it almost completely
[50:19] backwards. And that's because Bitcoin is
[50:20] a diffuse, leaderless ecosystem, doesn't
[50:22] have an army of lobbyists, doesn't have
[50:24] an army of of uh of of industry
[50:26] associations. And all those people are
[50:28] great people, right? We work with them.
[50:29] They're they're they're really, you
[50:30] know, but they're responsive to their
[50:31] incentives, right? And to their
[50:33] community that they engage with, right?
[50:34] their their industry um you know
[50:36] representatives and oftentimes you know
[50:38] the bottom line matters much more than
[50:40] like kind of this this this core
[50:43] technology principle and it's kind of
[50:45] because there's you know Bitcoin solves
[50:47] it's kind of the the height of ironies
[50:48] right Bitcoin solved a you know computer
[50:51] science problem that was wrapped around
[50:53] a coordination problem right like how do
[50:54] you have you know essentially a
[50:56] decentralized you know um you know sort
[50:59] of ledger right where there's no there's
[51:01] no central sort of you know counterparty
[51:03] to trust Um and it used these very
[51:05] clever tricks of cryptography and game
[51:06] theory, proof of work, etc. to sort of
[51:08] engineer uh distribute consensus. Um but
[51:11] now we have this environment where like
[51:13] that in that system there's now
[51:14] coordination problem, right? There's a
[51:16] there's a there's a risk that everyone
[51:17] in the network and everyone in the
[51:18] industry is exposed to, but there's no
[51:21] single like coordination point uh to try
[51:24] to like motivate action, right? So it
[51:26] all has to be done through podcast and
[51:28] through Twitter and to say this is
[51:29] important guys like we should call you
[51:31] should call your congressman. you should
[51:32] say blockchain regulatory certainty act.
[51:34] This is actually a priority. This is why
[51:36] I guarantee you most people in Congress
[51:38] have no idea this even exists. And it's
[51:40] thanks to the work of of some, you know,
[51:42] um uh real champions to even get this in
[51:44] there. But I think this is a call to
[51:46] action for for the Bitcoin community to
[51:48] really pay attention to these sorts of
[51:50] things um and to make their voice heard.
[51:52] kind of we had like that that issue a
[51:54] few years ago where it was um like the
[51:56] the the late night broker rule and there
[51:58] was this you know um cause celeb and
[52:01] everyone got on their phones and called
[52:03] um and you know this is kind of like
[52:06] that right this is kind of like an issue
[52:08] where you really need to kind of get in
[52:09] the trenches here and say this is
[52:10] actually a priority because otherwise
[52:12] folks that pay for lobbyists right to
[52:14] get their stable coin you know
[52:15] definition sort of regulatory moat um
[52:18] carved out they get the meetings right
[52:21] they get the the that the politicians
[52:23] listen, right? And they go, "Okay, I'm
[52:25] hearing every day people come to my
[52:26] office talking about market share stable
[52:28] coins. I haven't heard a single person
[52:30] come to my office talking about or call
[52:31] my office talking about blockchain
[52:32] records for a certain act. That's all I
[52:34] need to know about what I should care
[52:36] about, right?" And and that's just
[52:38] literally how like the like the the
[52:40] calculation game works here. BPI
[52:43] obviously is trying to like trying to
[52:44] like tip the scales, but I would say you
[52:46] know we're like 10% of the you know
[52:49] advocacy uh you know uh engine inside DC
[52:53] at best uh when it comes to digital
[52:54] assets and so yeah we we we would need
[52:57] uh all all the help we can get. Yeah. In
[53:00] fact it's it's the same issue as the
[53:01] midnight broker rule. It's the same
[53:04] there. The scariest thing about this
[53:06] potential authoritarian creep of getting
[53:08] this problem wrong. Um is that it can go
[53:13] unnoticed for a while. Uh and there are
[53:16] two ways in which it go unnoticed. One,
[53:18] we can lose the stuff that really
[53:19] matters here that both makes Bitcoin
[53:21] freedom money, but even the thing that
[53:23] makes Bitcoin valuable as an asset that
[53:24] it's a credible neutral commodity. um we
[53:28] can lose that while still looking like
[53:30] number is going up based on ETF flows.
[53:33] Uh and those things can be divorced. And
[53:36] then the right now I think the scariest
[53:38] way in which it can go unnoticed is
[53:39] unlike the fight over the broker rule
[53:42] where that was through a democratic
[53:44] process right it was through the
[53:45] legislative process and the industry was
[53:47] able to make noise. We can get a federal
[53:50] judge. There are two cases that will
[53:52] allow federal judges to basically
[53:54] unilaterally create this rule without
[53:56] any democratic buyin, which is why we
[53:59] need to be so focused on those cases at
[54:01] the current moment. And and just briefly
[54:04] to sort of close the loop on this, we
[54:06] got some news in one of those cases this
[54:08] week. Uh the defense uh in the uh
[54:11] Samurai Wallet case filed uh a few
[54:14] motions. Um they'd wanted to file a
[54:16] bunch of motions along the way. the
[54:18] judge has been a little bit um I would
[54:21] say unfair to them and said you have to
[54:22] do all your motions at once and so this
[54:23] was the time they did all their motions
[54:24] at once. So just to keep people up to
[54:26] speed so that these don't go under the
[54:27] radar. Uh defendants filed a motion to
[54:30] dismiss the charges against them both
[54:31] the moneyaundering conspiracy charge and
[54:34] the unlicensed transmission charge. Um
[54:36] those are great briefs. We posted them
[54:38] on the BPI website. Folks should read
[54:39] them. Uh banger arguments. Shout out,
[54:43] you know, to Roger Burham and and
[54:45] Michael Krauss who've been doing a great
[54:47] job defending this case um and who we've
[54:49] been funding through the the P2P rights
[54:50] fund. Um we learned for the first time
[54:53] in these briefs the government is going
[54:54] to like in the tornado cash case drop
[54:57] what's called one of the objects of the
[54:59] money laundering the money transmission
[55:01] charge which is the direct statement
[55:03] that the bank secrecy act doesn't
[55:05] require customer control. I think this
[55:06] is due to the really excellent advocacy
[55:09] efforts we've seen across the industry.
[55:11] Um the folks who've understood this
[55:12] problem uh have pushed things to the
[55:14] point where we got the Blanch memo and
[55:16] at least we're not getting the
[55:17] government saying out loud that the bank
[55:19] secrecy act directly applies. Now,
[55:21] however, they're they are saying a thing
[55:23] that strongly rhymes with that, which is
[55:24] that the defense in this case
[55:26] transmitted funds, which is still
[55:28] unacceptable from a precedent
[55:29] perspective, but we're getting some
[55:31] positive momentum there. Um their
[55:35] defendants filed uh motions to suppress
[55:37] certain evidence in in Kon Rodriguez's
[55:40] case. Um the issue is that he allegedly
[55:44] invoked right to counsel and the police
[55:47] interrogating him did not listen to that
[55:48] and they extracted things from him that
[55:51] they should not have under the fifth and
[55:53] sixth amendments. United States the
[55:55] fifth amendment is due process and gives
[55:57] you a right against self-inccrimination.
[55:58] If you've ever heard about someone
[55:59] pleading the fifth, that's what that's
[56:01] about. The sixth amendment is your right
[56:02] to counsel in a criminal case. Uh so
[56:04] that's about whether he invoked that
[56:06] right to counsel. If you've ever heard
[56:07] of Miranda rights, you have a right to
[56:08] remain silent. You have the right to an
[56:09] attorney. Uh they're alleging that the
[56:12] police violated that right. And so the
[56:14] remedy under the fourth amendment uh is
[56:16] that you are able to suppress evidence,
[56:19] keep evidence that was gained as a
[56:21] result of those illegal actions out of
[56:23] the trial. Um similarly, uh William or
[56:26] Bill Hill uh filed a different motion to
[56:28] suppress this one a little bit
[56:29] different. So it's a fourth amendment.
[56:30] the fourth amendment of the
[56:31] constitution. These are all parts of the
[56:32] bill of rights which are the first amend
[56:33] amendments. Fourth amendment is about
[56:35] unreasonable search and seizure. Uh they
[56:37] said that the search of his electronic
[56:38] devices violated the fourth amendment
[56:40] and was uh illegal in in various ways
[56:43] and trying to suppress that evidence. Um
[56:45] Bill also filed a motion to separate his
[56:49] trial from KUN so they would each have a
[56:50] separate jury trial. The reason for that
[56:52] is so that they can call each other as
[56:54] fact witnesses. Um one of the issues in
[56:56] this case is going to be their mindset.
[56:58] Did they know they were doing something
[56:59] wrong? Did they intentionally break the
[57:00] law? And there's apparently a bunch of
[57:03] communications between them where they
[57:05] understood the Fininsson rules to be the
[57:06] thing that basically everyone else did,
[57:07] which is what they were doing was legal.
[57:09] And they were compliant with all of the
[57:11] laws and regulations they had to be. And
[57:14] uh in order to prove that mind state,
[57:15] they need to have each other sort of
[57:17] testify about their conversations, but
[57:18] in a way that doesn't wave each other's
[57:21] right against self-inccrimination from
[57:22] the jury. Because if it's in the same
[57:24] trial and one defendant testifies in
[57:26] favor of the other as a fact witness,
[57:28] that opens that defendant up to
[57:30] cross-examination by the government,
[57:31] which normally uh you have the right not
[57:33] to have happen. So that's when people
[57:35] are seeing the motion to separate
[57:36] trials. That's what's that about. And
[57:38] then there were two other motions that
[57:40] should have just been no-brainers. One
[57:42] is this is a complicated for the reasons
[57:43] we've been talking about this whole
[57:44] podcast, a complicated legal issue. And
[57:46] normally the judge has what's called a
[57:48] local rule where he only wants briefs to
[57:50] be 25 pages long. Uh the defense council
[57:53] asked permission to file a 35page brief
[57:55] and the the judge said no. It's a little
[57:57] bit mystifying here. Uh and then also
[57:59] because this is a tricky issue, they
[58:01] asked uh the right to file two amicus
[58:03] briefs. Amicus is Latin. It's short for
[58:05] amicus curi or friend of the court. Uh
[58:07] which are uh people who are not actually
[58:10] lawyers or defendants in the case. Uh
[58:12] but they can file some brief sort of
[58:15] explaining an issue they're expert on to
[58:17] the judge to help the judge understand
[58:18] these issues. Obviously, that would be
[58:20] really helpful in this case. And there
[58:22] were two proposed amicus briefs. One was
[58:24] from the blockchain association and the
[58:26] DeFi education fund, which are both
[58:27] great organizations. Um, and the other
[58:29] was from ourselves and Coin Center, also
[58:32] great organizations. And the judge was
[58:34] like, I don't want to hear it, but maybe
[58:35] at oral argument you can bring in uh
[58:38] Amicus then. So, really hard to
[58:40] understand how a judge in his late 70s
[58:43] understands these technical issues so
[58:44] well that he couldn't use our help. But,
[58:47] but there you have it.
[58:49] Yeah, it was uh definitely disappointing
[58:51] at least on my end having been tracking
[58:53] this for a while to see all of that um
[58:56] sort of play out. But, you know, these
[58:58] things are are long processes. Uh you
[59:00] know, still kind of time for for things
[59:03] to maybe turn in another direction or uh
[59:05] you know, more time for us to pass the
[59:08] blockchain regulatory act. That's the
[59:10] There you go. Yeah, that's that's a
[59:12] great point. Okay, cool. Uh we're we're
[59:15] coming up on the hour here. Um, anything
[59:17] else you all want to talk about before
[59:19] we before we wrap up here? Sign up for a

[59:49] yeah, it's gonna be a great event. And,
[59:51] uh, yeah, that's it for this week. We'll
[59:53] see you next
