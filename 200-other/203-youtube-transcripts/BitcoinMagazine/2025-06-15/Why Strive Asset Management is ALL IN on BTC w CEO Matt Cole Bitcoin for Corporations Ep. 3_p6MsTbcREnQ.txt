[00:00] Welcome to the Bitcoin for Corporations
[00:02] show. My name is Pierre Ashard. I'm here
[00:06] joined with Matt Cole from Strive.
[00:08] Welcome, Matt. Welcome to the show.
[00:09] Thanks, Pierre. And uh we're recording
[00:11] this live at the Bitcoin Conference in
[00:13] Las Vegas 2025. Uh this is quite the
[00:17] event. It is the biggest Bitcoin event
[00:19] I've ever been to. What do you think,
[00:20] Matt? Yeah, I I mean, last year in
[00:23] Nashville, it was massive. This year, it
[00:26] took it up even another notch. And I
[00:28] mean the energy here is off the charts.
[00:30] Just couldn't be more bullish about the
[00:32] future. So uh tell us there's been a lot
[00:34] of great news coming from Strive the um
[00:38] approach of doing a reverse merger to uh
[00:40] enter into as a Bitcoin treasury company
[00:42] into the public markets. Uh really
[00:45] curious to hear about that. And then I
[00:46] heard you speak earlier about uh alpha
[00:49] strategies versus beta strategies. So I
[00:51] think it'd be really interesting for the
[00:52] audience to understand what
[00:54] differentiates uh those two different
[00:56] approaches to the world of Bitcoin
[00:58] finance. Yeah, absolutely. I I think
[01:00] just to start in saying Bitcoin treasury
[01:03] corporations at large, less than 1% of
[01:06] publicly traded companies have Bitcoin
[01:08] on their balance sheet right now. And so
[01:09] I think that's why things like Bitcoin
[01:11] for corporations this podcast are so
[01:13] important that we are so early. And I
[01:15] think sometimes people will say, "Oh,
[01:17] well, you know, Strive now there's
[01:19] another one. There's another one.
[01:21] There's still less than 1% of companies
[01:23] and most companies should have Bitcoin
[01:25] on their balance sheet and decide how
[01:26] far that they want to go in. For us,
[01:28] we're going all in, right? And strategy
[01:31] has gone all in. You've obviously seen a
[01:32] handful of companies that have gone in,
[01:34] Nakamoto's going all in, and you know,
[01:36] MetaPlanet doing amazing things. And
[01:38] when we went all in, we said, "Okay,
[01:40] we're all in on a Bitcoin strate
[01:42] treasury strategy." the beta strategies
[01:44] that have been deployed to date, which
[01:46] beta strategies, what we mean by that
[01:47] are just leverage strategies that
[01:49] actually are designed to outperform
[01:51] Bitcoin over the long run to acrue value
[01:53] to common equity shareholders, increase
[01:54] bitco bitcoin per share. Those things
[01:57] are amazing as you know, but for strive,
[01:59] we're an asset manager and my background
[02:02] is actually driving alpha strategies.
[02:04] That's what I used to do. I did it for
[02:05] 16 years in fixed income space. Our
[02:08] co-founder, Vake, he actually drove
[02:10] alpha strategies. He used to run a hedge
[02:11] fund in the biotech industry. So we
[02:13] said, okay, we actually have some
[02:14] differentiation that's unique to us to
[02:16] to actually expand how you can even
[02:18] think about a Bitcoin treasury company.
[02:20] And so, you know, we started with
[02:22] intentionally doing a reverse merger and
[02:24] and other company like Nakamoto was
[02:27] doing that as well. There's a lot of
[02:28] advantages to doing a reverse merger
[02:30] than doing something like a spec.
[02:32] Namely, that if you do it well, one, you
[02:34] actually have access to your shelf on
[02:36] day one. So you can do equity issuance
[02:38] issuances, fixed income issu issuances.
[02:41] is you don't have to wait a year with a
[02:42] spec you have to wait a year. So that
[02:43] was something that was distinctive. Um
[02:45] prior to the alpha strategy, we also
[02:47] laid out the first 351 exchange where we
[02:49] actually can allow Bitcoin holders that
[02:52] are accredited to give us Bitcoin. We
[02:54] can give them back shares in a tax-free
[02:56] exchange. So it's actually a win-win
[02:58] because there's actually a liquidity
[02:59] trap for people that have been in
[03:01] Bitcoin. And as we know, Bitcoin goes up
[03:03] and to the right all the time, right?
[03:05] we're sitting at $100,000 and you know
[03:07] people don't I don't want to pay the
[03:09] government if I don't have to for legal
[03:11] reasons and if I can get a legal way to
[03:13] exchange some of my Bitcoin for a share
[03:15] of a Bitcoin treasury company I think
[03:16] that's an awesome opportunity. So we're
[03:18] we're bringing that innovation but then
[03:21] this week we had a couple new major
[03:23] announcements. So the first was we
[03:25] raised $750 million in a pipe and then
[03:28] also have warrants that could bring in
[03:29] an additional $750 million. And so, you
[03:32] know, if you're looking to actually be a
[03:34] major player in the Bitcoin treasury
[03:36] space, you got to get to a billion
[03:38] dollars because when you get to a
[03:40] billion dollars of size, that actually
[03:42] starts the flywheel of the volatility
[03:44] effect that sailors able to drive the
[03:46] options markets and the ability to do
[03:48] convertible notes on good terms. And I
[03:50] think, you know, right now my assessment
[03:52] of the space is it is very hard to break
[03:55] a company like strategy. Most people in
[03:58] traditional media don't even understand
[03:59] it. They just see the leverage. They get
[04:01] afraid. they don't understand Bitcoin,
[04:02] let alone Bitcoin treasury company, and
[04:04] it's just, oh, this whole thing is going
[04:05] to blow up. That's not where we are in
[04:07] this space today. And I think in in any
[04:10] new space, as new companies come in, my
[04:13] guess will be that people will
[04:14] overlever. Uh that's just that's just I
[04:16] think how freedom and capital markets
[04:18] work and greed works. But that's not
[04:20] where we are with Bitcoin treasury
[04:21] companies today. So, we will use those
[04:23] leverage strategies. But then on the
[04:25] alpha side, we laid out just three
[04:27] strategies. So you can think about think
[04:29] about a multistrat hedge fund and
[04:31] there's hundreds of these hedge funds
[04:33] and they outperform every year. We found
[04:35] a couple strategies that were very
[04:36] proprietary to us. Um leveraging our
[04:39] expertise in the biotech industry where
[04:41] there's literally $30 billion of trapped
[04:43] cash in the biotech industry. Companies
[04:45] that have had a negative clinical trial
[04:49] but yet they're really well capitalized
[04:51] actually. They have typically hundred
[04:52] million $200 million of cash but not
[04:55] really a future. And so there's a
[04:56] win-win there where we can actually
[04:58] merge them into our company and then buy
[05:01] cash basically at a 10 to 15% discount
[05:03] discount by Bitcoin discounted Bitcoin.
[05:05] Right. We're not that's not a leverage
[05:07] strategy. That's just a a a creative way
[05:10] to get capital. Right. Right. Um Bitcoin
[05:12] claims another one these mount claims.
[05:15] Why do they trade at a discount? It's
[05:16] not because of the risk on the legal
[05:19] side. It's actually because of the
[05:20] duration risk that they're that they're
[05:22] less liquid than Bitcoin. Right? Bitcoin
[05:23] trades 24/7. So that liquidity risk
[05:26] causes them to trade at a 20 to 30%
[05:28] discount. So, you know, again, for a
[05:31] company that has permanent capital,
[05:32] we're not an ETF. We are a Bitcoin
[05:34] treasury company. We're going to be well
[05:35] cap as with permanent capital. We can
[05:37] use some of our portfolio, take some
[05:39] liquidity risk because we know we don't
[05:41] need to sell our our Bitcoin, right, and
[05:43] buy Bitcoin claims at a discount. And
[05:44] then it kind of builds from there, but
[05:46] adding those on top of a of a levered
[05:48] Bitcoin strategy. And I think when you
[05:50] think about valuation of companies that
[05:52] can drive alpha, then I think the way to
[05:54] think about valuing them is it should be
[05:56] the MNAB from the leverage plus the
[05:58] alpha strategy. Wish you could access
[06:01] cash without selling your Bitcoin? Letin
[06:03] is the global leader in Bitcoin backed
[06:05] lending. They've issued over 9 billion
[06:07] in loans since 2018 and never lost a
[06:09] single Satoshi of client assets. A Lein
[06:12] loan is different. With custody loans,
[06:14] collateral is not lent out to generate
[06:16] interest. No credit checks, funds in
[06:18] under 12 hours with proof of reserves
[06:20] reports published every 6 months. Letin
[06:23] gives Bitcoin holders a secure and
[06:25] transparent way to unlock liquidity
[06:26] without selling. Learn more at letin.io.
[06:30] Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think
[06:31] that um when we think about the the
[06:34] biotech example um of that alpha
[06:37] strategy reminds me in in Bitcoin mining
[06:39] of finding wasted energy, stranded
[06:41] energy. Here you're finding stranded
[06:43] capital and putting it to a higher and
[06:45] greater use that then creates that
[06:48] flywheel of increasing shareholder
[06:49] value. Yeah, absolutely. And this is
[06:52] this is how innovation happens, right?
[06:54] You find an inefficiency in the market
[06:56] that is distinct to you. And if you're
[06:58] an energy expert and you can find
[07:00] stranded energy and and I mean we were
[07:02] talking about this before we before we
[07:04] got on stage here is that you think
[07:06] about you know environmental risk and we
[07:08] were talking kind I was kind of making
[07:09] the case that you know Strive used to
[07:12] push back and we still do when there is
[07:14] ESG overreach that constrains capital
[07:16] markets right Bitcoin should be from a
[07:18] first principles perspective the most
[07:20] pro ESG asset in the history of any
[07:22] asset right obviously we know about the
[07:24] scarcity and the bullishity but just
[07:26] from that and you look at the E well how
[07:28] much energy that was wasted um gas that
[07:31] was just flared as emissions has now
[07:33] been captured to mine Bitcoin I mean
[07:35] that is that is amazing innovation right
[07:37] and and moving beyond the you know the
[07:40] the skull look at the the bad energy
[07:42] right like like no it's it's it's
[07:43] accretive yeah uh and then on the other
[07:47] uh part of it of the uh claims and those
[07:51] at a discount it it reminds me of time
[07:53] arbitrage right where a corporation just
[07:56] has a longer time horizon if they're
[07:58] treating this as permanent capital than
[08:00] an individual who has their financial
[08:02] planning needs. Um, and I think that it
[08:04] also reflects the fact that Bitcoin's
[08:07] designed to last forever and normally a
[08:10] corporation is designed to last forever
[08:11] as well. You know, it's just a a going
[08:13] concern as we say. Um, whereas us as
[08:16] individuals, we are have a a lifespan,
[08:19] right? And um I think that it's almost
[08:22] an argument that Bitcoin is more
[08:24] appropriate for corporations than for
[08:26] individuals if you look at it through
[08:28] that lens of what's the time horizon on
[08:30] it. Yeah. I mean Bitcoin is I mean
[08:33] obviously extremely appropriate for the
[08:34] individual to give freedom to the
[08:36] individual and then for a corporation
[08:38] it's different right because a
[08:39] corporation isn't necessarily looking
[08:41] for an opt out to be able to like you
[08:43] know go to any country. What they're
[08:45] looking for is assets that actually
[08:47] maximize value to their shareholders
[08:48] over the long run. And that's where
[08:50] things like claims where you're actually
[08:52] getting Bitcoin in the future, but
[08:54] you're giving a you're giving liquidity
[08:56] to someone. And and you think about some
[08:57] of these Mount Gos holders. I mean,
[08:59] these guys have been put through hell
[09:00] for for years, right? I mean, now I
[09:02] guess in a sense, they've been forced to
[09:04] hold Bitcoin as it's risen to $100,000.
[09:07] So, uh, no, that's uh that's probably a
[09:10] win, but you can actually give them
[09:11] liquidity. We can take the liquidity.
[09:13] It's not even liquidity risk, but we
[09:15] just take illlquid assets to time,
[09:18] right? And and what's interesting is
[09:20] that, you know, if you think of
[09:21] pensions, so my background being under
[09:23] pension, the number one source of alpha
[09:25] for pensions is actually the fact that
[09:27] they're a long run investor. And so
[09:29] they'll take liquidity risk to actually
[09:31] drive alpha. It's not sometimes people
[09:33] think of these things as super complex.
[09:35] Liquidity risk isn't complex. It's just
[09:37] taking advantage. I mean I was talking
[09:38] to someone else that you know used today
[09:40] used to work at the Harvard endowment
[09:42] and some of the tax structures that give
[09:44] them long run alpha right everybody has
[09:46] to look internal to themselves or
[09:48] corporation if you do hard enough you
[09:50] can probably find a distinct advantage
[09:52] that you have to drive alpha for your
[09:53] shareholders that makes a lot of sense
[09:55] now you mentioned that Strive has a
[09:57] strong track record of pushing back
[09:59] against ESG um where it was uh
[10:03] destroying value instead of creating
[10:04] value um and so do you also see stri
[10:07] role in the industry of advancing
[10:09] Bitcoin adoption at other corporations
[10:11] through similar forms of activism.
[10:13] Absolutely. So core to our mission is
[10:16] financial freedom, true financial
[10:17] freedom. And so part of that was pushing
[10:20] back against ESG constraints towards
[10:21] unapologetic capitalism, meritocracy,
[10:24] that your role as a fiduciary is to
[10:26] maximize long run value. Well, how do
[10:29] you maximize long run value? You better
[10:31] have Bitcoin on your balance sheet,
[10:32] right? If you're sitting there on a
[10:34] stockpile of cash that's losing
[10:36] purchasing power and we go in depth on
[10:38] this, I know you go in depth on this
[10:39] too. And inflation actually hides how
[10:42] much the the value of a dollar is being
[10:44] eroded, right? Because what's going up
[10:46] the most is actually financial assets.
[10:48] And you see this for the individuals and
[10:50] especially individuals that don't own
[10:52] Bitcoin. And it's really hard to afford
[10:55] a home. It's really hard to afford
[10:57] having kids. One of the things that's,
[10:59] you know, really refreshing to me at the
[11:01] Bitcoin conference is how many people I
[11:03] meet that have kids, that have
[11:04] flourishing lives, that I'm a Christian,
[11:06] that are people of faith, right? That
[11:09] this community has optimism because they
[11:12] found a a great asset, right? That gives
[11:14] the power back to the individual. Well,
[11:16] the same thing can happen to
[11:17] corporations. And I think corporations
[11:19] are are screwed when you look at
[11:21] actually AI innovation, the cash that
[11:23] they hold. And I think the opt out is
[11:26] actually putting Bitcoin on the balance
[11:27] sheet. All right. Well, thanks for
[11:28] joining us on the Bitcoin for
[11:30] Corporation show, Matt. We'll we'll have
[11:31] you on for a longer period in the
[11:33] future. Absolutely. Thanks, Pierre.
