[00:00] We have just just a very high conviction
[00:02] that Bitcoin is a, you know, digital
[00:04] real estate. The way Michael's talked
[00:06] about it, we really buy into that. So,
[00:08] we want to own a lot of digital real
[00:10] estate. And we think it's really
[00:11] important to do that now because
[00:14] Bitcoin, we believe, is is incredibly
[00:16] undervalued relative to gold and uh and
[00:19] it's worth more than gold, we believe.
[00:21] So, we should be aggressively purchasing
[00:23] Bitcoin on that thesis.
[00:32] Welcome to the Bitcoin for Corporation
[00:34] show. I'm your host, Pierre Rashard, and
[00:36] today I'm honored to be joined with Eric
[00:38] Semler from Simler Scientific. Eric, how
[00:40] are you? Great. It's great to be here.
[00:43] Uh so Eric, I I'd really love to to hear
[00:46] your your Bitcoin journey and uh where
[00:49] that started out at and then uh we'll
[00:52] work all the way to your today's
[00:54] announcement that Semilar has acquired
[00:56] an extra 185 Bitcoin. So congratulations
[00:59] on that. Thank you. I'm excited about
[01:01] it. Well, uh it all started for me I
[01:03] think back in 12 uh 2012. Um I was on a
[01:07] investor trip. I was working as a hedge
[01:09] fund manager running my hedge fund
[01:11] called TCS Capital. It was a long short
[01:14] fund and focused on technology and media
[01:17] and I uh was part of an investor group
[01:20] that went to visit Wes Casaris in his
[01:23] office when he was just starting out. I
[01:25] think it was called Rivet Capital and uh
[01:28] pretty blown away by his enthusiasm and
[01:31] his you know uh passion to to you know
[01:35] be a Bitcoin guy and um and didn't
[01:38] really understand it fully. That was my
[01:40] first exposure. Um, and then as the
[01:42] years passed, I think by like 12 2017, I
[01:46] uh finally purchased Bitcoin, uh, but
[01:49] was never really, uh, a hardcore Bitcoin
[01:53] maximalist until recently. uh with the
[01:56] institutionalization wave that really uh
[01:59] was the tipping point for me where when
[02:01] the with the ETFs and Black Rockck and
[02:04] um the you know just the overall
[02:07] institutionalization of Bitcoin, Bitcoin
[02:09] for uh for corporations, what Michael
[02:11] Sailor was doing, all of that stuff
[02:12] really uh uh was just a catalyst for a
[02:16] very high conviction in Bitcoin for me.
[02:20] It's really interesting. So I I've heard
[02:23] Wes's name come up a number of times in
[02:25] conversation with folks especially from
[02:27] Silicon Valley in terms of him being uh
[02:30] almost patient zero there of orange
[02:33] pilling lots of uh people in the valley.
[02:36] Um, but I think that he he's not he's
[02:39] not as loud on Twitter perhaps. And so a
[02:41] lot of people in the Bitcoin community
[02:43] uh aren't familiar with just how much
[02:45] impact Wes has had uh behind the scenes
[02:48] and and also in in in kind of driving
[02:51] forward the the VC ecosystem around
[02:53] Bitcoin. You know, it's interesting that
[02:55] I I hadn't seen him and I don't think he
[02:58] he even knew who I was, you know, uh
[03:01] over the years. Like we we didn't have a
[03:02] relationship. I just had met him on that
[03:04] investor trip and I didn't even
[03:06] recognize him. But last week in Las
[03:08] Vegas, I was at a reception, a cocktail
[03:11] reception and he and I and I, you know,
[03:13] we started talking and I explained to
[03:15] him how, you know, he was the guy that
[03:17] really first exposed me to Bitcoin and
[03:19] we we spoke for about a half hour. It's
[03:20] just terrific guy. we um you know we
[03:24] were able to uh really connect and I
[03:26] really it was a very personal
[03:28] conversation and um I do think that he
[03:30] has taken a lower profile and good for
[03:32] him you know he's he deserves it he can
[03:35] do whatever he wants you know he he's
[03:37] earned it
[03:39] yeah absolutely uh I I had a chance to
[03:41] be on a panel with him at JP Morgan in
[03:44] 2018 perhaps and um when when I walked
[03:47] into the room and saw him I was I was
[03:49] almost like surprised of oh you're
[03:51] you're doing a public event. Uh this is
[03:53] great because uh you know he's he's
[03:56] legendary uh with his early support of
[03:58] Bitcoin and building up Zapo Bank as
[04:00] well. Um so uh you you mentioned you you
[04:04] used to run or you still do uh uh run a
[04:08] uh hedge fund uh long short strategy.
[04:12] Yeah, I don't I it's called a family
[04:14] office now, but I started TCS Capital.
[04:16] Those were my wife's initials in in
[04:19] 2001. uh and which was a tough time to
[04:22] start a hedge fund back then but uh I
[04:24] ended up doing well in those tough years
[04:27] was able to raise decent amount of
[04:28] capital and to perform well. We were
[04:30] about 4 billion under management at our
[04:32] peak and we focused on uh technology and
[04:35] media and communications and uh I did
[04:38] that for probably about 16 years. Uh and
[04:41] then uh at that point I decided to
[04:43] become a family office. But my strategy
[04:45] was always I was I was always just very
[04:48] interested in kind of contrarian ideas
[04:51] or things that were not well followed.
[04:53] So I had kind of this natural
[04:55] inclination to you know to be interested
[04:57] in Bitcoin. I guess it's it's kind of
[04:59] part of my MO. You know, I'm I'm an
[05:01] outside the box thinker when it comes to
[05:03] stocks and and investment concepts,
[05:06] hopefully in everything I do, but I've
[05:08] always been kind of attracted to things
[05:10] that other people, you know, weren't so
[05:13] excited about. For me, that's the
[05:14] opportunity when something is kind of
[05:16] out of favor and and you can get it
[05:18] right in in your, you know, in your
[05:20] investment, uh, you can make a, you
[05:23] know, much higher returns than you would
[05:25] kind of following the herd. And were you
[05:28] watching macro or were you really
[05:30] focused on relative value plays uh as
[05:33] part of the long short strategy? Very
[05:36] much single stock, you know, long short.
[05:39] Uh not wasn't really that focused on the
[05:42] macro. There are times when you have to
[05:45] be even as an individual stock picker
[05:47] like especially these days the market
[05:49] has become much more macro driven for
[05:52] everyone. Uh and so there's um there
[05:55] there we've all kind of had to become
[05:57] better at the macro. It's it's had such
[05:59] an impact influence on individual
[06:01] stocks.
[06:03] And now with Bitcoin, I I think that
[06:05] Bitcoin has grown into a macro asset
[06:08] itself. Uh would you characterize it
[06:11] that way now at a $2 trillion market
[06:13] cap? For sure. Yeah, it definitely has.
[06:15] And um it's made me more of a
[06:17] macrooriented investor too because when
[06:21] you when you first start studying it,
[06:23] you obviously have to think about the
[06:25] what it means globally for as an asset
[06:28] class. And it's not it's so different
[06:30] from anything I typically have looked
[06:32] at, you know, where there's cash flows
[06:33] and earnings and conference calls and
[06:36] meetings with management, you know, that
[06:38] that's just uh you know, that's that's
[06:40] that's been my life, you know, in my
[06:42] professional life. But this is uh this
[06:44] is totally different. Yeah. And when you
[06:47] were investing in technology, what did
[06:50] you make of kind of the open-source
[06:51] movement and Linux and that whole
[06:54] ecosystem? Did you have a view on that?
[06:56] Um yeah, it was actually not an area
[06:59] that I spent a lot of time investing in.
[07:01] I was you in my early days I was really
[07:05] uh around those times I was very focused
[07:07] on the media space media and
[07:09] telecommunications and you know less so
[07:12] on technology per se. Um I my background
[07:16] before going into the investment
[07:18] business was as a journalist. I worked
[07:19] at the New York Times. I worked for a
[07:21] Russian newspaper called Moscow News.
[07:24] And so, um, I wasn't really, uh, a
[07:27] financial guy until I had gone to, uh,
[07:29] business school and worked in some, you
[07:31] know, in some financial firms before
[07:33] starting my own fund. And my background
[07:35] was really more about media, wanting to
[07:38] follow the media space, uh, and telecom.
[07:41] And, um, I I I I, you know, I took it
[07:45] came at it very differently from typical
[07:48] investors. I was, uh, journalist. I took
[07:50] like a journalistic approach. So my my
[07:53] strengths are as a journalist like
[07:54] interviewing people, coming up with a
[07:56] thesis, really testing it, doing a lot
[07:59] of research, investigation and uh and
[08:02] trying to stay neutral, trying to be
[08:03] very objective when I look at something
[08:06] and there weren't a lot of uh investors
[08:08] oriented that way and that helped me
[08:10] differentiate myself and my performance
[08:12] and so I was I was re I was just
[08:15] naturally interested in the media
[08:16] business and that helped me the media
[08:18] business at that time was dynamic, you
[08:21] know, And it was also um consolidating
[08:24] which al when when sectors consolidate
[08:26] there's a there's a lot of opportunity
[08:28] to make a lot of money like through M&A
[08:30] transactions and and and just a lot of a
[08:34] lot of movement and the checkerboard and
[08:36] and it's a lot of strategic thinking uh
[08:38] a lot of kind it's not like so much are
[08:40] they going to beat the quarter or you
[08:42] know uh what did what what were the what
[08:45] were the numbers like this week or this
[08:46] month. It was very much kind of thinking
[08:49] bigger picture strategically about, you
[08:51] know, how the chess pieces were going to
[08:53] go and and that's that's how I was able
[08:56] to succeed in those early years and less
[08:59] so in technology. I'd say that that kind
[09:01] of came later more in the middle of my
[09:04] career and um I was focused I got
[09:06] focused more on kind of on digital media
[09:09] so like you know Google and Netflix and
[09:11] things like that. Yeah, that makes a lot
[09:13] of sense. Um, now given that media
[09:16] background and and starting out at the
[09:18] New York Times, uh, over the years, what
[09:20] have you made of the the media coverage
[09:23] on Bitcoin? Uh, and they they seem to
[09:25] have maybe not have had as much of a
[09:29] objective view of it. It seems like
[09:31] quite often, whether it's the New York
[09:32] Times or the Wall Street Journal or a
[09:35] lot of the other mainstream
[09:36] publications, they
[09:38] Yeah, Financial Times been very
[09:39] negative. A lot of negative editorials.
[09:42] Um, yeah, I I don't think it's it's
[09:45] still really uh covered very well. It's
[09:48] hard to think of, you know, journalists
[09:50] at those at those kind of uh traditional
[09:52] media institutions that are really uh
[09:55] covering it well. You know, I noticed it
[09:58] firsthand when the coverage of Bitcoin
[10:00] Treasury companies, you know, they call
[10:02] us copycats, you know, and they it's
[10:04] very derogatory. you know, they're
[10:06] really nice when they interview you, but
[10:08] then when they write the story, it's
[10:09] always kind of got a negative bent to
[10:11] it, like ah, these guys are just, you
[10:13] know, following a fat or a trend. And so
[10:16] there's there it it there's a kind of a
[10:19] a a negative bias toward it. Um, and I
[10:22] think about that a lot because, you
[10:24] know, I was a journalist and I tried to
[10:25] I always try to be very balanced in when
[10:27] I wrote a story and try to really get
[10:29] both perspectives and keep my personal
[10:32] views out of it. But I think it's very
[10:34] hard for journalists to do that now. And
[10:36] I think there's probably more pressure
[10:38] to put your opinion in an article,
[10:41] interestingly, which um I'm I'm really
[10:43] against. I'm very much into objectivity
[10:45] and neutrality in that realm, like in
[10:48] the journalistic realm when you're
[10:50] writing a news story, right? Uh it's one
[10:52] thing to have an opinion, it's it's
[10:53] another to be reporting the facts. Uh
[10:56] and uh I I saw it firsthand. I was
[10:58] previously at Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin
[11:00] mining company, and we had a a beautiful
[11:03] hit piece written by the New York Times,
[11:05] uh on how much pollution is coming out
[11:08] of these computers. Yeah. Um so, uh it
[11:12] but I do also think that it has created
[11:14] a unique opportunity for platforms like
[11:16] Bitcoin Magazine to emerge and to really
[11:19] get a big readership because now they're
[11:21] able to uh provide the other side of the
[11:23] story. Yeah. And I think the podcast
[11:26] world too, you know, which where I get a
[11:28] lot of my information from on Bitcoin,
[11:30] you know, just what Michael Sailor's
[11:32] done with podcasts has been so valuable.
[11:34] And I think that that is where kind of
[11:37] that's where the audience is headed,
[11:38] right? And and I think that it's
[11:40] balanced it out a lot. So, you know,
[11:42] you'll see your occasional negative
[11:44] story in New York Times or Financial
[11:45] Times, but then it's it's so overwhelmed
[11:48] by all this very informative, more
[11:50] balanced kind of information that you
[11:53] get on in through podcast particularly
[11:56] completely agree. Um, so let's let's
[11:59] bring it to some h how did you go from
[12:02] uh operating a hedge fund to uh starting
[12:04] a medical company? Well, I did start the
[12:07] medical company. I actually, it's kind
[12:09] of, it's an interesting story because
[12:11] toward the end of my time running my
[12:13] hedge fund, TCS, I became much more of
[12:16] an activist and I call it a a
[12:19] reluctivist. I didn't enjoy being an
[12:21] activist because that means you got to
[12:22] kind of have to be nasty and go after
[12:24] management teams and tell them how bad
[12:26] they're doing and you want you're
[12:27] demanding a board seat or a proxy fight
[12:30] and that's not my style. Like I don't
[12:32] love being controversial or
[12:34] antagonistic. I just want to own stocks
[12:37] kind of passively and hope that they,
[12:39] you know, work for me. And um but
[12:42] they're just I do have a very long-term
[12:44] perspective. And so there were stocks
[12:47] that I would just, you know, I'd be the
[12:49] last guy standing. You know, I like I
[12:51] like to say I went to Dartmouth and our
[12:53] motto is box Clementus in Desertto,
[12:55] which means lone lone voice crying in
[12:58] the wilderness. And that's how I felt in
[13:01] a lot of stocks that I'd own. I just
[13:03] wouldn't give up. There were stocks like
[13:04] Angie's List or Move.com or Geeknet.
[13:08] These companies are just like I I
[13:09] literally was the largest shareholder
[13:11] institutionally and everybody else had
[13:13] just thrown in the towel. And at that
[13:15] point, you're just like and you're now
[13:18] on like CEO number three or four since
[13:21] you the stock and nobody there really
[13:24] knows what happened before except you.
[13:26] And and so I just decided at some point
[13:29] I need to kind of, you know, take the
[13:32] bull by the horns and and and and uh try
[13:35] to create change to help shareholders.
[13:38] And I I started doing that. I started
[13:40] with um started with a Chinese company
[13:42] that and it really worked out well. It
[13:44] was trading like below its cash value.
[13:47] And I went I I was shocked because it
[13:49] was based in China and I was actually
[13:50] able to convince the board to um to to
[13:54] when they decided to take it private to
[13:56] pay a much higher price for it. And then
[13:58] I started doing that with some other
[14:00] companies and eventually I'd go I went
[14:01] on the boards of some public companies
[14:03] and affect it changed. And I really
[14:05] enjoyed that. I realized that like this
[14:07] is a great way to create value. I'm I
[14:10] I'm I have good skills at kind of
[14:12] interacting with people on boards and
[14:14] trying to talk them into my perspective
[14:16] and doing it in a friendly way and it
[14:18] and it was really it really was working
[14:20] for me. It was lucrative and it was
[14:23] effective. So I I as toward the end of
[14:25] my career I just started doing much more
[14:27] of this and realized you know I don't I
[14:29] probably should just be a family office.
[14:31] It's a little more difficult when you
[14:32] have when you're interested in like one
[14:34] stock and you're spending all your time
[14:36] on it. You're supposed to be running a
[14:37] portfolio. it's easier if you're kind of
[14:39] just doing it with your own capital. So,
[14:41] I just started doing that on my own. And
[14:44] then Semler, Semler was a company that
[14:47] uh had been around since I think 2014,
[14:49] the public markets, but I was a I was a
[14:52] seed investor. I was like a founding
[14:54] investor in the company back in in 2007.
[14:57] So uh my father who's a cardiologist in
[15:00] Oregon started the company but he he he
[15:03] needed capital and I was I was funding
[15:05] him with another uh one or two investors
[15:09] at that time. and I ended up owning, you
[15:11] know, uh, when it went public about 10%
[15:13] of the company and, um, I was really
[15:16] wasn't in, you know, that paying that
[15:18] close attention to it because it was my
[15:20] dad's business and, uh, you know, I just
[15:22] wanted to help him out and see him do
[15:24] well. But I wasn't a healthcare investor
[15:26] and was a healthcare company. So, um, I
[15:29] I wasn't I was pretty happy with the
[15:32] returns from like 2016 to 2021. Similar
[15:36] was up 13,500%.
[15:38] It went up 136x, had this incredible uh
[15:42] medical device and software product that
[15:44] was uh just, you know, super successful
[15:47] and high margin and there was no reason
[15:49] to really get, you know, activists or
[15:51] anything like that. Uh but then um the
[15:54] the winds went kind of started to
[15:56] change. There were headwinds and and
[15:59] their business was affected by some
[16:01] regulatory changes at at CMS, which
[16:04] oversees the Medicare Advantage program.
[16:07] And that uh that took the stock down a
[16:09] lot and I decided uh you know to get
[16:12] involved uh in uh like two years ago
[16:15] 2023. And so I I actually did a like an
[16:18] activist campaign. I you know a
[16:20] reluctivist you know reluctantly getting
[16:22] involved and uh went to the board and
[16:25] said I'd like you know some board seats.
[16:27] I'd like to reformulate the board. I was
[16:28] a large shareholder. I was coming in
[16:30] with another large shareholder and they
[16:32] agreed to a settlement and I went on the
[16:34] board. I became chairman. I reformulated
[16:37] it with where there was four board
[16:39] members and three of us owned over 30%
[16:42] collectively of the company and uh my
[16:44] father was no longer involved you know
[16:46] it's not a shareholder or anything that
[16:48] I'm aware of. So it was it was just it's
[16:51] it happened to have my name on it but it
[16:53] wasn't like something I had had a long
[16:55] history with. And so and so in 2023 I
[16:58] came into the company and uh we had
[17:01] we're in a situation where our stock was
[17:03] very depressed. We were trading at
[17:04] extremely low valuation. We were uh
[17:08] generating good cash. We were um we had
[17:11] about 40% of our market cap was in cash.
[17:14] So we you know we had this opportunity
[17:16] to deploy cash and I just assumed at
[17:19] that time you know would be through
[17:20] acquisitions uh which we ended up not
[17:23] doing. Instead you know we decided to
[17:24] buy Bitcoin.
[17:26] Yeah. So, um, h how did you jump from
[17:30] being bullish on Bitcoin on a personal
[17:32] level to seeing it as as a corporate
[17:35] strategy? It's a great question. Really
[17:37] good question. Um, I think uh I think
[17:41] Michael Sailor is the two-word answer to
[17:43] that. I think that as an as a follower
[17:46] of the stock markets and you know when
[17:47] you have a company as successful as
[17:49] Micro Strategy was in the stock market,
[17:52] you can't help but notice that if you're
[17:53] interested in Bitcoin like me, you're
[17:55] like a shareholder of that company and
[17:56] you're like, "Wow." And then as a
[17:58] shareholder of the company, you pay
[17:59] close attention to it. You listen to
[18:02] every word Michael said because it was
[18:04] pretty valuable content and uh very
[18:07] instructive for me. And so it was just
[18:10] kind of like uh it was it there was some
[18:13] it was it really resonated for me and it
[18:15] it felt like I was looking in the mirror
[18:17] a little bit where uh when I went on the
[18:20] board assembler and I saw how much cash
[18:22] we had and we couldn't find an
[18:24] acquisition and I I started you know
[18:26] thinking about what Michael Sailor's
[18:28] position was in 2020 in August of 2020
[18:31] where he had a very similar financial
[18:33] profile to our company and I was
[18:35] thinking God you know maybe we are Micro
[18:38] Strategy
[18:39] of, you know, 2024, you know, four years
[18:41] later. Maybe we should consider what
[18:44] Michael Sailor did in August of 2020.
[18:47] Uh, and so I went to my board, I tried
[18:49] to educate them as much as I could about
[18:51] Micro Strategy and Bitcoin and and why
[18:54] it's worked for Micro Strategy and not I
[18:56] didn't know Michael Sailor at that
[18:58] point. Um, but our board was on board
[19:01] with it. They really thought it was a
[19:03] would be a really smart move given how
[19:05] successful Bitcoin is. And again with
[19:07] institutional prospects, we thought it
[19:09] made sense. And uh it it stunned me that
[19:12] no one had tried to do this at except
[19:15] for Michael Sailor at that point. I
[19:17] mean, he'd been at it for four years and
[19:20] or three or four maybe it was three
[19:21] years at that point and and and it
[19:24] stunned me with a guy who had that much
[19:26] success with his company and stock and
[19:29] and still no followers. And so, you
[19:33] know, when we announced it, we thought
[19:34] we were the first follower. I think
[19:35] MetaPlanet beat us by a few weeks, but
[19:38] uh we basically were simultaneously
[19:40] coming out with this strategy, you know,
[19:42] opposite ends of the world, but uh it
[19:45] was uh it was kind of risky. You know,
[19:47] it was a little it was a little bit uh a
[19:50] little bit anxious when we uh put out
[19:52] that press release on May 28th, 2024,
[19:56] almost exactly a year ago. Wish you
[19:58] could access cash without selling your
[20:00] Bitcoin? Letin is the global leader in

[20:28] Yeah, I can imagine. Uh what after
[20:31] Sailor announced in 2020
[20:34] um I was working at Kraken and they
[20:35] asked me to on a webinar make a crazy
[20:38] prediction for 21 and I said half the
[20:41] S&P 500 would acquire Bitcoin. Uh so
[20:44] that was probably you know my worst uh
[20:46] crazy prediction I've I've made. Um but
[20:49] it's it's been um I I I heard uh the now
[20:52] CEO of uh strategy Fong say that a major
[20:57] challenge is the board of directors. Uh
[20:59] that you can have management alignment
[21:02] but sometimes the board just can't get
[21:05] on board with it. Um no pun intended. Uh
[21:09] so you've you mentioned you've had a lot
[21:12] of board experience. Um do you think
[21:14] there's what are the kind of the
[21:16] structural or or almost uh psychological
[21:19] sociological reasons for uh what what
[21:21] the barriers are at the board level?
[21:24] Yeah, there's a lot of them. Most public
[21:26] company boards are are full of uh
[21:28] retired people who are looking to uh get
[21:31] a a quarterly check from the board or
[21:34] shares and not rock the boat. uh the
[21:37] goal is kind of stability and uh and so
[21:40] that kind of goes against the idea of
[21:42] doing something as radical as you know
[21:44] putting Bitcoin on your balance sheet. I
[21:47] think that that is uh kind of
[21:49] antithetical to what most Bo board
[21:51] members in America are uh setting out to
[21:54] do with their uh board uh roles. So
[21:59] that's difficult. And then I think on
[22:00] top of that is just Bitcoin's been
[22:03] volatile rel for for you know the
[22:05] typical board member who doesn't
[22:07] understand Bitcoin and you know isn't
[22:10] isn't uh convinced that it makes sense
[22:13] at all you know not just for corporate
[22:16] treasury. So um there's a there's just a
[22:19] kind of an ignorance I think toward
[22:21] that. There's a there's an aversion to
[22:23] volatility. there's a sense of really
[22:26] wanting to maintain the status quo and
[22:30] um I think that those are huge barriers.
[22:33] So in a way you you need companies who
[22:36] have boards that are have tight control
[22:38] like ours did like we our board had a
[22:41] lot of skin in the game. We owned a lot
[22:42] of stock. We were nimble that way. We
[22:45] were open to you know we were
[22:47] open-minded. I know that's kind of a
[22:49] nebulous concept, but being open-minded
[22:52] and proactive are such important
[22:54] qualities of a board. Don't see that,
[22:56] you know, too much. Like when Michael
[22:58] Sailor pitched Microsoft board, did they
[23:00] seem open-minded? They just seem
[23:02] dismissive, you know, and so, you know,
[23:06] you need that kind of mindset on a board
[23:08] to do this. So, it's hard. It's hard.
[23:10] It's just difficult to find that. It's
[23:12] not a It's not very common. Um, just as
[23:16] a side note, I I I I meet with public
[23:19] companies all the time just because I,
[23:21] you know, I still invest a lot in in in
[23:24] um non- Bitcoin oriented stocks uh in
[23:28] technology and media. I had a company in
[23:29] my office yesterday, pretty big uh
[23:32] casino company. I won't mention their
[23:34] name, probably, you know, 8 billion
[23:37] market cap. great cash flowing business,
[23:40] very high margins, only growing one or
[23:42] two percent. But very steady, huge free
[23:45] cash flow. And I was stunned because
[23:48] they they seemed they seem like the kind
[23:50] of company that would never do this.
[23:52] They very old-fashioned, kind of family
[23:55] controlled, but public. Um been in the
[23:57] family for 50 years, probably wouldn't
[24:00] want to ever kind of destroy the value
[24:02] they've created. and the the the the CFO
[24:06] of the company who I've known a long
[24:08] time who's basically kind of the face of
[24:10] the company uh came into my office and I
[24:13] was really surprised because I thought
[24:14] we were going to talk about his company
[24:16] but he ended up spending most of the
[24:18] time asking me about Bitcoin treasury
[24:21] strategy and he didn't know anything
[24:23] about Bitcoin and he just kept asking me
[24:25] like how do I learn more can you what
[24:27] what should I do and you know can you
[24:29] send me something and I was stunned I
[24:31] mean we're talking about a very
[24:32] oldfashioned
[24:34] mindset company and they were they
[24:38] suggested he suggested they might be
[24:40] open to it because they've been buying
[24:42] back they bought back billions of
[24:44] dollars of stock. Hasn't hasn't really
[24:47] made any money doing that. You know,
[24:48] it's kind of kind of flat on those
[24:50] purchases. Their stock's been relatively
[24:52] flat. It hasn't been a poor performer,
[24:55] but it hasn't really gone up a lot. And
[24:58] they don't really know what to do.
[25:00] They're generating a lot of cash.
[25:01] there's nothing really to buy. Uh, you
[25:04] know, the casino business is is just
[25:06] kind of a very mature business, but a
[25:08] great cash flowing business. It's a
[25:10] perfect candidate for this. And I think
[25:13] he understood understands that, but just
[25:15] needs to understand why Bitcoin is the
[25:18] answer and you know to his balance sheet
[25:21] questions. And so, you know, it's it's
[25:24] kind of an interesting question for me
[25:27] in that meeting. What he said when he
[25:28] said to me, "What should I read? What
[25:29] should I do?" you know, and I was like,
[25:32] my head was sp, you know, I just like
[25:34] hm, you know, there's so much I read and
[25:37] listened to like where do you start? So,
[25:39] I guess I think I my my first my first
[25:42] reaction was read the Bitcoin standard
[25:45] and I and I'd love to hear what you
[25:47] think, Pierre, because I, you know, I'm
[25:48] relatively new to this, but I would love
[25:50] your suggestions for people like that. I
[25:53] thought I I'd say, you know, read the
[25:54] Bitcoin standard, you know, read the
[25:56] first seven chapters kind of quickly and
[25:59] then really focus on chapter eight
[26:02] and then uh, you know, and then you'll
[26:04] probably that will help you if you if
[26:06] that doesn't really get you to want to
[26:09] know more, then you're probably not
[26:11] going to go any further. But then I, you
[26:13] know, I would probably suggest a lot of
[26:14] Michael Sailor uh podcast, but there
[26:17] must be so much, you know, that Yeah, I
[26:20] I definitely think uh the Bitcoin
[26:22] standard is up there on the list uh and
[26:24] has now sold millions of copies
[26:27] worldwide in in every different
[26:29] language. So, uh it is part of the
[26:31] Bitcoin cannon. Um we've got this
[26:34] podcast uh Bitcoinerations show now. So
[26:37] absolutely I I definitely think that um
[26:40] this is a huge opportunity for
[26:42] developing the content for that audience
[26:45] because um you know we we have lots of
[26:48] content that I think is geared towards
[26:50] for lack of a better word retail or just
[26:53] uh the general public. Yeah. Um and
[26:55] adapting that to the world view of
[26:58] corporations and balance sheets and
[27:00] accounting. uh that is a bridge that
[27:03] that is being built and that uh Sailor
[27:06] and and Bitcoin Magazine have done an
[27:08] excellent job of um putting that
[27:11] together and and we're only at the
[27:13] beginning. Uh as you point out, there's
[27:15] lots of businesses like this casino
[27:17] business that um they they're they're
[27:21] starting to understand that something's
[27:23] wrong here. uh and and that to create
[27:26] shareholder value they have to uh adapt
[27:29] and and and think outside the box on
[27:31] Bitcoin. Yeah, for sure. Um you started
[27:35] in uh last year, is that correct? Uh
[27:39] yeah about exactly a year ago we
[27:41] announced a a strategy. And did you have
[27:44] um friends within the management team,
[27:47] the CFO that was also orange pill or or
[27:50] were you uh as as you uh alluded to kind
[27:54] of uh on your own and and developing the
[27:58] the education? I was on my own
[28:01] developing myself. Yeah. I mean there
[28:02] were we were fortunate to have very
[28:05] open-minded uh people were willing to
[28:07] listen uh both on the man senior
[28:10] management and on the board and so I I
[28:13] honestly I I wasn't sure if it was just
[28:15] like I you know I probably started off
[28:17] by saying I have a really off-the-wall
[28:18] idea
[28:21] don't you know you guys are going to
[28:23] think I'm nuts but and I I actually did
[28:26] write that I think I think you guys are
[28:28] going to think I'm nuts but I want to
[28:29] run something by you because we had been
[28:32] spending so much time together looking
[28:34] at,
[28:36] you know, companies to buy in the
[28:37] medical space, mostly private, and
[28:40] there's they're just there's just such a
[28:42] lack of transparency and a and
[28:44] uncertainty when you go down that path,
[28:46] you know, and then the prices people ask
[28:48] for outrageous and and you're not in
[28:50] their businesses for the most part.
[28:52] We're not there's not we didn't have we
[28:53] don't have a lot of competition, if any,
[28:55] in our space. So we were looking at
[28:58] adjacencies and um you know that when
[29:00] you get into things that you're not in
[29:02] you know you're not in the business of
[29:03] it's you it's really like uh very
[29:06] there's a lot of risk and uncertainty to
[29:09] that. So it got very frustrating. We
[29:11] spent so much time like we you know do
[29:14] due diligence. We travel to these
[29:16] companies meet their founders and their
[29:18] CEOs and it was just kind of like
[29:21] running into a wall. Uh, and um, I felt
[29:25] like at some point we were going to
[29:26] compromise. Like I thought, you know,
[29:28] like let's just buy this thing. You
[29:30] know, it's it's uh, you know, we got all
[29:32] this cash and our business is under
[29:34] pressure. We need something else and,
[29:38] you know, let's just kind of settle, you
[29:40] know, for something that's not, you
[29:42] know, the perfect acquisition or not
[29:44] even like a clearly outstanding
[29:46] acquisition. We we we also looked at
[29:49] things like we're buying the senior debt
[29:50] of some distressed companies and it was
[29:53] just so messy, you know, it was like
[29:54] there's a there was a lot of hoops to go
[29:56] through and seemed very complicated. So
[30:00] like it was just it was just getting
[30:01] harder and harder to find a great deal.
[30:03] And that's why, you know, I kind of
[30:05] turned to Bitcoin because it just was so
[30:07] much clearer and transparent and
[30:09] straightforward yet, you know, so
[30:12] foreign to my colleagues at at Semlar.
[30:15] Yeah. Do do you think the the the high
[30:18] valuations are being driven by is it
[30:21] private equity that's driving them up or
[30:23] are there other factors? Yeah, it's
[30:25] private equity. It's there's
[30:26] competition. A lot of these things are
[30:28] like auctions, you know, so like there's
[30:30] other potential biders. Um there's I
[30:34] think there's this mindset of
[30:35] entrepreneurs, founders who just think
[30:37] their business is worth obviously a lot
[30:39] more than it really is because it's
[30:41] their baby, you know? So like that
[30:44] there's that that's difficult for people
[30:46] to kind of relinquish. And um and then
[30:49] there's a lot of this kind of well yeah
[30:51] we're kind of flat this year but next
[30:52] year we're going to be up 60%.
[30:54] [Laughter]
[30:56] You're like oh we got this new thing
[30:57] it's we're going to be up a lot and
[30:59] you're just like um h I'm going to buy
[31:02] into that. You know you've been flat for
[31:05] four years and now all of a sudden
[31:07] business is taking off. So it's it's
[31:10] things like that and you're just you
[31:12] just Bitcoin is so much better than all
[31:13] of that you know and um how was it after
[31:18] so
[31:19] first you know the the conversation with
[31:22] the board um how long did it take to to
[31:25] kind of socialize the idea and to to get
[31:27] that buy in. Uh what was that process
[31:29] like? Yeah, I don't remember exactly how
[31:31] long, but it was it was definitely like
[31:32] several weeks, probably quicker than
[31:35] most processes at the board level
[31:37] because there were only four of us,
[31:40] including me. Um, and and uh and we were
[31:45] very interactive. Uh we were we we have
[31:49] a really close relationships in terms of
[31:52] like we had nobody we work 247. We're
[31:56] not nineto-fs and and we text a lot, you
[31:59] know, we do a lot of um lot of
[32:01] communication. Uh it's almost like, you
[32:04] know, we work at the company. We're
[32:05] just, you know, we care so much about
[32:07] it. It's a huge investment for all of us
[32:09] collectively. So, we we put a lot of
[32:12] time and concern into it. And so, we
[32:16] probably move quicker. But I would say
[32:17] it was probably a few weeks of, you
[32:20] know, listening to podcasts. was uh and
[32:22] and and sending articles and talking to
[32:25] people. Uh there were some uh really
[32:28] interesting people that were advising us
[32:31] to some degree, you know, that I pulled
[32:33] in for for meetings, for Zooms and
[32:35] things like that who were very
[32:36] knowledgeable on Bitcoin. So, um uh
[32:39] yeah, that was kind of the process. It
[32:41] was just an educational process. And so
[32:44] would that be your advice to a CEO who
[32:46] who's really trying to get their board
[32:48] uh to to buy into Bitcoin to bring in uh
[32:53] Bitcoin experts uh and just
[32:56] overcommunicate, you know, what
[32:59] current events and uh what's going on in
[33:01] the Bitcoin space. Yeah, I think so. I
[33:04] think um if you can get Michael Sailor
[33:06] to show up, we you know, we didn't have
[33:08] that, but uh uh that would probably be
[33:11] your that would be the your know your
[33:13] killer uh killer app for that one. But
[33:17] um but I think that um you you need you
[33:22] need uh you you definitely need very
[33:24] persuasive people who can explain it in
[33:27] layman's terms uh and for people that
[33:30] really don't understand it or don't
[33:32] believe in it. Um, I think that the the
[33:36] examples are important. I think micro
[33:38] strategy success, metaplanet success are
[33:42] really powerful for for companies to
[33:44] look at. I think that's part of what is
[33:46] making like the CFO of this casino
[33:48] company interested. Like he doesn't
[33:50] necessarily know those companies, but he
[33:51] knows that there are companies out there
[33:53] been successful. knows Bitcoin's been
[33:55] successful, but then you have this just,
[33:57] you know, the the government in the US
[33:59] being so supportive of it, I think has
[34:02] to make every financial, you know,
[34:05] player think, wow, am I missing out on
[34:07] something really important here? And
[34:09] then you hear the drum beat of of the
[34:11] deficit. I mean, it's really loud these
[34:13] days, right? And there's this sense that
[34:15] that can cannot be kicked down the road
[34:18] much further. Uh I always when I started
[34:20] out I would you know it was always this
[34:22] issue was always kind of overhanging the
[34:24] deficit and the debt but it was never
[34:27] like it always just felt like you know
[34:29] we're going to have a Fed chair is going
[34:30] to kick the can down the road and I
[34:32] never when you asked me earlier you know
[34:34] are you a macro investor I was very
[34:36] cognizant of the macro but I always just
[34:38] felt like that we were going to get
[34:39] bailed out you know and and in fact
[34:43] those create buying opportunities when
[34:45] you have the Fed step in or reverse you
[34:48] know, it's policy to be more doubbish.
[34:51] Like all of that is just really
[34:53] fantastic stuff that I never really
[34:55] worried about when I was picking stocks
[34:58] because I always felt like the Fed had
[35:00] my back, you know, and I think we're
[35:03] just in in such a different time now
[35:06] where the Fed doesn't have a lot of
[35:08] flexibility
[35:09] um that some of this is just, you know,
[35:11] beyond our control. It's, you know, the
[35:13] bond vigilantes or whatever. you know,
[35:15] it's it's just it's it's gotten too
[35:17] massive and our debts being downgraded
[35:20] and it's not really even about the US,
[35:22] it's the whole world. So, you know, um
[35:25] yeah, I I I went off on a tangent there,
[35:27] but Yeah. Yeah. But painting that
[35:29] picture for the more conservative board
[35:31] members, I think, would help to add a
[35:33] sense of urgency that if they want the
[35:36] company to survive and thrive through
[35:39] these times, uh that they need, you can
[35:42] think of it as an insurance policy,
[35:43] right? We're taking on less risk by
[35:45] taking a a Bitcoin position. Yeah. And I
[35:48] think also this idea of what if you are
[35:50] a company with a lot of cash on your
[35:52] balance sheet um buying back stock is
[35:55] not so uh obviously uh creative, right?
[35:58] Like you know this company that I was
[36:00] talking about earlier that you know they
[36:02] haven't really done well with their
[36:03] buyback. It's been fine but it's not
[36:06] what they it's not the kind of return
[36:07] they were looking for. Um there's a lot
[36:10] of companies who have a lot of cash and
[36:11] if they buy back stock they just make
[36:13] their stock thinner, less traded and it
[36:16] just becomes more of a zombie, right? So
[36:18] that you're you're reducing the float
[36:20] and that that's not necessarily smart
[36:23] thing to do if you're trying to attract
[36:25] bigger more larger investors. Um and
[36:28] then you know dividends are not tax
[36:31] efficient. They're kind of out of favor.
[36:33] And I think I think um I think buybacks
[36:36] are becoming less, you know, favor in
[36:38] favor too. And so then it just leaves
[36:41] you with kind of this, you know, we got
[36:42] to do an acquisition. And you know,
[36:45] acquisitions are dicey, as I was saying
[36:47] earlier. And so now you're kind and now
[36:49] you're sitting on this cash that's
[36:51] really not earning a a justifiable
[36:54] return. And so now you've got to now you
[36:57] got to think about stuff like Bitcoin, I
[36:59] think, or gold or whatever. But, you
[37:01] know, it's it's it's it's um it's it's
[37:04] it's narrowing. The options are really
[37:06] narrowing for public companies and their
[37:08] balance sheets.
[37:10] So, um I I'm focusing in on this because
[37:13] uh you mentioned you've had a lot of
[37:14] board experience. So, uh I'm I'm also
[37:17] curious. I I I heard somebody suggest
[37:20] that hey look if if the board is not
[37:23] open or if there's one board member who
[37:26] is essentially exercising a veto power
[37:29] you need to ask them to resign and uh
[37:31] obviously I know that's not the
[37:33] situation it's similar but given your
[37:34] experience what what are the governance
[37:36] limitations for making a move like that
[37:39] in my mind I thought well that might
[37:41] send a really negative signal to the
[37:42] market it does I mean if I'm an investor
[37:45] in a public company and a board member
[37:46] resigns I'm nervous like why why would
[37:48] that happen? There's something really
[37:50] bad happening at this company and
[37:52] somebody objects to it and they they're
[37:55] leaving. That's that's a that's a red
[37:57] flag. Um but in this case, I mean, they
[38:00] can't say, "Oh, I'm leaving because they
[38:03] I'm against their Bitcoin Treasury
[38:05] strategy." I guess if they said that,
[38:07] "I'm leaving because of I'm against
[38:09] their Bitcoin treasury." I might be,
[38:10] "Okay, good. I'm glad you left." But I
[38:13] don't think they're going to be that
[38:14] specific, right? But may maybe it'll
[38:17] come out in the wash, you know. So, I
[38:19] think that um I think that's an
[38:22] interesting dynamic. I I I rar you
[38:24] rarely see that. You rarely see board
[38:27] members usually leave voluntarily. If
[38:29] they leave, they don't leave because
[38:31] they were forced out, you know. Um they
[38:34] leave because of guys like me who are
[38:36] doing an activist campaign against them
[38:38] and are trying to do, you know, get uh
[38:41] board seats, proxy or, you know,
[38:42] settlement or something. and that that
[38:45] you know is a very active market, but
[38:47] it's but that's really the only way this
[38:49] stuff really happens. Uh and usually
[38:52] there's a there's a a settlement.
[38:53] There's a compromise of some sort. You
[38:56] don't always end up with board seats. Uh
[38:58] when if you want to push companies to do
[39:00] a Bitcoin treasury strategy, um you can
[39:03] I would think that um like what Matt's
[39:05] doing, Matt Cole's doing makes sense.
[39:07] like they're probably he's probably
[39:09] going to make a lot of headway finding
[39:11] companies, zombie companies that uh see
[39:14] this as a way to kind of to get higher
[39:17] returns and electrify the company. I
[39:20] think that that is um probably a good
[39:23] not a bad strategy because I think
[39:25] boards more and more boards is
[39:27] especially smaller companies are going
[39:29] to be receptive to that because they're
[39:31] just they're kind of stuck in you know
[39:33] they're in an impass,
[39:36] right? Um, that makes sense. And in a
[39:38] lot of ways, it's it's like if you had a
[39:40] a board member at Apple who said that,
[39:42] you know, phones cause cancer and we
[39:44] need to stop doing the iPhone. It's
[39:46] like, well, you're really at the wrong
[39:48] company here.
[39:51] Yeah, for sure. You can have that
[39:53] opinion, but it's not Yeah, there's such
[39:57] a a group think and there's so there's
[39:59] very little dissension on the boards
[40:01] that I've been on, you know, previously.
[40:03] Like there's there's um it you know it's
[40:06] hard because I've been on a few boards
[40:08] where I am kind of the lone desenter.
[40:10] Like I'm there I got on the board.
[40:12] They're pissed at me because you know
[40:14] they did I caused a lot I I kind of
[40:16] embarrassed them publicly by saying
[40:18] they're doing the wrong things and they
[40:19] need to give me a board seat and I've
[40:20] got on the board in those situations and
[40:23] everybody just looks at you and you show
[40:24] up for the first board meeting like
[40:26] you've got a disease and you know some
[40:28] won't even talk to you. Uh but I like
[40:32] those situations. It's challenge and and
[40:34] and I was able to overcome that by kind
[40:36] of trying to show people that I'm
[40:38] actually just intellectually disagree
[40:40] with them. You know, it's not personal
[40:43] and uh and and and that if you really
[40:46] want to stock to go up, I got to believe
[40:49] you do. Then you should really consider
[40:51] what I'm saying. And in in a lot of
[40:53] cases for me in those days, it was
[40:55] really, you know, you need to sell the
[40:56] company. you know, you usually the
[40:59] answer is a sale um when when you're
[41:02] struggling and you have strategic value
[41:04] and the market's not giving it to you.
[41:06] So, um it's hard to convince people to
[41:09] do that. Why would a board member want
[41:10] to sell when they're getting they're
[41:12] retired and they're getting a check,
[41:13] right? Why would this you want this to
[41:15] come to an end? Um but it it's and you
[41:19] don't own a ton of stock, you know, so
[41:20] like there's no incentive to do that.
[41:22] But that that was kind of my pet peeve
[41:24] was, you know, these guys were uh
[41:27] depriving shareholders of value by not,
[41:30] you know, pursuing strategic
[41:31] alternatives.
[41:33] and and for for the uh for the board
[41:36] members or even for for others who who
[41:39] look at uh what Sailor's doing or did
[41:42] with strategy, you know, the tender
[41:44] offer. uh do do you think that that that
[41:47] is going to make sense for other
[41:49] companies or was that just because he
[41:52] was the first one doing it and yeah you
[41:54] know we thought a lot about that because
[41:56] we were nervous that you know our our
[41:58] healthc care shareholders would be upset
[42:00] about this pivot and we weren't sure how
[42:03] they would react but then you have this
[42:05] dilemma of not you don't really want to
[42:08] uh announce it before you actually buy
[42:10] the Bitcoin like you you know there's
[42:11] there's you're kind of negotiating
[42:13] against yourself a little it's
[42:15] counterproductive.
[42:17] Uh so we we that was a very difficult
[42:19] decision to make but we decided to just
[42:22] make the announcement and um and it was
[42:24] it was it ended up you know the stock
[42:26] quadrupled basically subsequently to
[42:28] that almost. So it ended up being you
[42:31] know very positive for everyone who uh
[42:34] was an investor at the time and and and
[42:36] subsequent to that. Um but I think now
[42:40] that we've had so many announcements I
[42:42] don't think you need to do that. I don't
[42:44] think you need to do, you know, what
[42:46] Michael did. I think it was very noble
[42:48] of him to do that. Um, but I think that
[42:51] it's probably consern, you know, kind of
[42:54] become common uh enough and popular
[42:58] enough to not have to do that. But I I
[43:00] would I would commend a board for doing
[43:01] it if that if that's how they would
[43:03] prefer to do it. Uh that that's you know
[43:06] that that would be I would understand
[43:08] why they would want to do that, right?
[43:11] Because um we hear the argument
[43:13] sometimes of well the reason why you
[43:16] should do a buyback or you know give the
[43:18] cash back to the investors is to let
[43:20] them make an investment decision with it
[43:22] and if they want to go buy Bitcoin they
[43:25] should do that. Uh you know what what
[43:27] what how do you think through that
[43:29] dynamic and what do you think the
[43:31] fallacy is there? Well, I think that the
[43:34] the reason you buy back stock if you're
[43:37] a company is because you think that your
[43:39] stock has a lot of upside and that
[43:41] you're it's it you're trying to generate
[43:44] um a a a very good IRRa on your cash and
[43:48] that's that's some people see that as a
[43:50] return of capital too, but I I look at
[43:53] it more as um I'm we're taking our cash
[43:55] to buy back our stock because we believe
[43:58] that in a year and two years it's going
[44:00] to be, you know, whatever 30% higher or
[44:02] 50% % higher. And that that's why you do
[44:05] that. You don't buy back your stock
[44:07] because it's down a lot or because you
[44:10] know there's a huge buyer in the mark, a
[44:12] huge seller in the market and you need
[44:14] to like soop it up. I don't think that's
[44:16] why you do it. I think that if um you
[44:19] return capital, I think the best way to
[44:21] do that really is through dividends or a
[44:24] special dividend. It's often a good
[44:26] move. You don't see that too often. Um,
[44:30] but I I I kind of I think of buybacks
[44:33] more as an investment. Uh, I don't think
[44:35] of them as a return of capital so much.
[44:38] Yeah, that's a very rational way to to
[44:40] look at it that you're you are buying
[44:42] the stock. Uh, and I think that's how I
[44:46] think that's how Warren Buffett really
[44:47] views it and I think that's why he was
[44:49] so good at it. You know, he's a king of
[44:51] buybacks and and I think you know he
[44:53] didn't buy back any stock I think right
[44:54] in his last quart you know. So, I mean,
[44:56] that's always a signal, right, that when
[44:58] he's not doing it, but he he he's a
[45:01] master of buyback stock, but there
[45:02] aren't that many who are really as good
[45:05] at that as he as he has been. Yeah. And
[45:08] um now after the the board is uh bullish
[45:12] on Bitcoin, may maybe one of the
[45:14] questions that comes up is well uh
[45:17] hasn't sailor already done this? So it
[45:19] kind of flips it on its head of well you
[45:22] know because others have done it really
[45:24] is there a place for us in the capital
[45:26] markets to also be doing this and and um
[45:30] what's what's your reaction to to that
[45:32] perspective?
[45:34] Well that's a good question too. I I
[45:36] think that it's um I think that it makes
[45:39] sense for Yeah. You have to think about
[45:42] it as your alternative. So you have this
[45:43] cash on your balance sheet. what would
[45:46] you what would you rather it be in
[45:48] Bitcoin or or or treasuries or whatever
[45:50] and and and so I think you start there
[45:52] and you say well I'd rather my cash was
[45:55] earning the return of Bitcoin over
[45:57] treasuries and so I think that's I think
[45:59] that's a good starting point so that
[46:01] doesn't necessarily mean you have to be
[46:03] on the Bitcoin standard or you know it's
[46:05] your primary reserve asset but it's
[46:07] probably just a good thing to have
[46:09] Bitcoin in your treasury that's a good
[46:11] starting point and maybe that's what you
[46:13] know yeah go ahead
[46:14] Oh, I was just mentioning that Tesla is
[46:16] a name that is, you know, doing that.
[46:18] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Or or GameStop
[46:20] might be doing that. It's hard to tell
[46:21] what they're doing, but uh but like from
[46:24] a you know, maybe that's just their
[46:26] plan. Let's get our feet wet. Let's you
[46:28] know, we think it's a good asset with a
[46:30] lot of upside and so maybe and we can
[46:32] it's commodity. We can have it on our
[46:34] balance sheet. So maybe so maybe that's
[46:36] that's the best place to start to, you
[46:38] know, and then there's all these
[46:40] different versions of this you can do.
[46:41] can use all of your cash, you can
[46:43] portion of it and I think a lot of it is
[46:45] just what you think um what you think
[46:48] that will will help you do in terms of
[46:52] uh creating shareholder value and um if
[46:54] the space gets super crowded and then
[46:57] you know MNAVs trade to lower levels and
[47:00] you know maybe that's a time to reassess
[47:02] or maybe it's not maybe you know MNAs
[47:05] will expand and decline over time maybe
[47:07] you can maybe there are ways that you
[47:10] can um buy Bitcoin that are more
[47:12] accretive perhaps through operating cash
[47:14] flow. A lot of the companies that are
[47:15] doing this are not generating operating
[47:17] cash flow. And so it's not as it doesn't
[47:21] it's not maybe as accreative to do as it
[47:23] was for M for Michael. But um I think
[47:26] that it it just really depends on the
[47:28] company you are. And I definitely I I I
[47:31] see a lot of companies doing this. But I
[47:34] think the best ones to do this are
[47:35] companies that generate cash flow that
[47:38] have uh scale that have the opportunity
[47:41] a scale in Bitcoin that have the
[47:42] opportunity to access debt and
[47:45] preferred. I think that's really um not
[47:48] going to be every company. I think
[47:50] there's just going to be a handful,
[47:52] maybe more than that, that are able to
[47:54] do that in a in a long-term meaningful
[47:57] way. We'd like to be one of those
[47:59] companies. uh we have just just a very
[48:02] high conviction that Bitcoin is a you
[48:04] know digital real estate the way
[48:06] Michael's talked about it we really buy
[48:07] into that so we want to own a lot of
[48:10] digital real estate and we think it's
[48:12] really important to do that now because
[48:14] Bitcoin we believe is is incredibly
[48:16] undervalued relative to gold and uh and
[48:20] is worth more than gold we believe so we
[48:22] should be aggressively purchasing
[48:24] Bitcoin on that thesis that that's how
[48:27] we how we look at it yeah that makes a
[48:29] lot of sense. And and do do you also
[48:33] have a view on the convergence between
[48:37] essentially the cost of capital uh
[48:39] whether it's debt or equity and
[48:41] Bitcoin's long-term keer, right? That
[48:44] shouldn't those two we need Bitcoin
[48:48] treasury companies to help those two
[48:51] numbers converge and that there's room
[48:54] for lots of companies in in that given
[48:57] how wide they are today.
[48:59] Yeah, absolutely. I think I think that's
[49:02] a great argument. I do believe there's a
[49:04] lot of room even though we've had these
[49:06] kind of this flurry of announcements and
[49:08] a lot of it, you know, is is still kind
[49:10] of being digested by the market. Like
[49:12] some there's been a lot of volatility
[49:14] around it. You know, some of the
[49:15] reactions have been very negative. Um,
[49:18] but I think it's a really positive trend
[49:21] and movement and and I think it the
[49:24] market, you know, in the longer term
[49:26] will will sort this out and it will it
[49:29] will reward companies for doing this for
[49:31] the reason you just said like it's it's
[49:33] a it's a much better higher return you
[49:36] of your you know of your balance sheet.
[49:38] Um, but I think that uh you have to
[49:42] really work hard to figure out how to do
[49:45] this accreatively, right? like it, you
[49:46] know, it takes time to crack the
[49:48] convertible markets and the preferred
[49:50] markets and using your cash flow uh to
[49:53] to buy Bitcoin, which is obviously super
[49:56] creative, I think. So, um so it it it's
[49:59] more it's it's probably more complex
[50:01] than it looks right now because so many
[50:03] companies are announcing these things
[50:04] and it looks too easy in a way to
[50:06] announce a Bitcoin treasury strategy. I
[50:08] think that some of the fallout we've had
[50:11] from that and some of the, you know, the
[50:13] lack of uh the the you don't have the
[50:16] same reaction sometimes that you had
[50:18] when we announced it or when uh you know
[50:20] when when Nakamoto announced it or caner
[50:24] and others, but I think that that
[50:27] doesn't really matter. I think you got
[50:28] to measure it over a longer term. And um
[50:31] I think that it makes a ton of sense
[50:33] still for for many more companies to do
[50:36] this. And I think it's great for
[50:38] Bitcoin. I just think that, you know,
[50:39] it's going to create enormous demand
[50:42] that that I agree on. And and if we look
[50:45] at even the history of MSTR, uh they
[50:48] they had a a MNAV that was below 1x
[50:51] during the previous bare market. And I
[50:54] think that nobody was claiming them as a
[50:58] success story until the past six months
[51:01] uh essentially after uh five years of
[51:03] executing on this strategy. So I I agree
[51:06] with you that this has to be looked at
[51:08] long term. We can't look at it quarter
[51:10] to quarter even or monthto month. Yeah.
[51:12] And I remember when the ETFs were coming
[51:14] out, I was talking to some of the
[51:16] sellside crypto analyst some at some of
[51:19] the firms who cover Bitcoin. Um, and
[51:22] they were a few of them were really
[51:24] negative on Micro Strategy, uh, on the
[51:26] ETF coming out because, oh, well, I can
[51:28] buy the ETF. Um, it's ne Micro Strategy
[51:32] is trading a premium to Bitcoin, so it
[51:34] should go down a lot. I wouldn't own
[51:36] that, you know, and look, they that was
[51:38] completely wrong, right? uh and that
[51:41] that that premium has sustained itself.
[51:44] You know, it's bounced around, but I
[51:46] think that um there's real justification
[51:49] for that. I think, you know, you can
[51:50] argue about what is that what what
[51:52] justifies the premium, but to me it
[51:54] makes it it's very logical why Micro
[51:57] trades a premium, but it's interesting
[51:59] that once people thought we'd have this
[52:01] ETF that there would be no reason to own
[52:03] Micro Strategy anymore, and you know,
[52:05] that was completely wrong. So I I am
[52:08] curious to hear uh you know gi given all
[52:10] of your experience in capital markets
[52:12] what what you see as the structural
[52:14] justifications for the premium whether
[52:17] it's for MSTR or Semler any kind of
[52:20] Bitcoin treasury company what the
[52:22] fundamental drivers are from first
[52:24] principles I think there's some very
[52:26] concrete ones that I just you can't
[52:29] really argue over uh one is just this
[52:32] concept of you're a big mutual fund you
[52:36] can't buy bitco coin. You can't buy the
[52:38] ETFs. You have to buy a stock if you
[52:40] want exposure to Bitcoin. There just
[52:42] aren't that many big institutional
[52:44] portfolio managers who want to do that.
[52:47] I mean, there's been some great, the
[52:48] guys who've done it have just been, you
[52:50] know, superstars in their world. And so,
[52:53] they're definitely, you know, you talk
[52:55] about all the Bitcoin treasury
[52:56] strategies companies that are popping
[52:57] up. How about all the fund managers that
[53:00] need to pop up that haven't been buying
[53:02] Bitcoin who've been in denial and now
[53:04] they're like, "God, you know, I got to
[53:06] become a I got to get some Bitcoin in my
[53:08] portfolio." Yeah. We're just aren't that
[53:10] many pieces of paper. Even with all the
[53:13] companies that have been announced, um,
[53:15] you got to be a five or six billion
[53:17] dollar market cap for to be in kind of a
[53:20] a major fund, you know, like a a large
[53:22] fund. I mean, it can vary, but if you
[53:24] want people to buy your stock and size
[53:26] in their mutual fund, you got to be you
[53:29] got reasonable scale. And truthfully,
[53:32] there just aren't that many equity
[53:34] players. It's pieces of paper in the
[53:36] stock market that have that market cap,
[53:39] you know, and and so there's a scarcity.
[53:43] There's just a scarcity value for it.
[53:45] being a being an equity play on Bitcoin
[53:48] there's demand for in the stock markets
[53:50] from the you know the buy side the
[53:52] mutual funds and institutional funds so
[53:55] that's a just a huge amount of demand
[53:57] right there so that that's that's
[54:00] scarcity value justifies some premium I
[54:02] believe then the other part of it is
[54:05] just leverage right I mean you could
[54:07] borrow money to buy IBIT but also we're
[54:09] a levered company I think we're the most
[54:10] levered Bitcoin treasury or we were
[54:13] until recently we have a convert that uh
[54:16] is about 20% of our market cap in
[54:18] Bitcoin holdings. Um we're not super
[54:21] levered but you know we do have more
[54:22] leverage than most. Uh and so so um that
[54:26] might justify a you know a premium and I
[54:30] think that just I I think that the the
[54:32] the you know the um the volatility of
[54:35] our stock we're at 125%
[54:37] you know Micro has high volatility
[54:40] MetaPlanet does too. that volatility
[54:42] creates financing opportunities like
[54:44] especially in the convert markets. So uh
[54:46] who you know in the confer markets ma
[54:49] fund managers that are trying to
[54:50] monetize volatility by you know shoring
[54:53] and buying and you know trading
[54:55] basically this converts and I think that
[54:58] um that also you know has a justifies uh
[55:02] the volatility the uh premium and then I
[55:05] think there's a more of an intangible
[55:07] thing um it's just more your your your
[55:10] your relationship with the Bitcoin
[55:12] community and the brand kind of your
[55:14] your brand equity with the Bitcoin
[55:17] community, which is so important because
[55:19] your shareholder base is really uh
[55:21] that's the foundation of your
[55:22] shareholder base for the most part. Um
[55:25] we have some great institutional
[55:26] shareholders uh but we also have a lot
[55:29] of individual Bitcoin Bitcoiners who own
[55:32] our stock and I think that they uh are a
[55:35] really important component of this and
[55:38] they want to hear more than just you
[55:40] know they want to hear buys. They want
[55:41] to hear that you bought Bitcoin
[55:42] accreatively, but they also want to know
[55:45] that you're fully committed to what
[55:46] you're doing, that you're not just, you
[55:49] know, kind of a fly by night. Uh, and I
[55:52] think there's real value in that. I
[55:54] don't know how to measure that, but that
[55:56] definitely, uh, it will can translate
[55:59] into some premium value. Uh, and I think
[56:02] that's really happened really well for
[56:04] Michael. I think especially for
[56:06] MetaPlanet, I think MetaPlanet's done a
[56:08] phenomenal job in that department. And I
[56:11] think being in Japan also just a a
[56:13] fantastic angle to it. Uh and uh you
[56:17] know, but I think that that's something
[56:18] that uh we would love to you know,
[56:22] enhance with our story. I feel like
[56:24] we've um we're just we're you know,
[56:26] we're we're we're trying to become uh a
[56:29] bigger voice in the Bitcoin community.
[56:33] Uh but at the same time, you know, we
[56:35] should benefit from being um you know,
[56:38] one of the rare larger public equities
[56:41] in the space or and we have own half a
[56:43] billion dollars of Bitcoin and we're
[56:44] continuing to buy it and that you know
[56:47] we're levered. So I think all of those
[56:49] aspects can justify the premium. Um and
[56:54] how do you think about the the risk
[56:55] management on the leverage uh with with
[56:58] the converts? Uh what's your thought
[56:59] process on that? I feel good about that
[57:02] because um it's five-year durable debt.
[57:04] There's no there's no there's no
[57:06] three-year, you know, put provision back
[57:08] to us like a lot of these converts have.
[57:10] So, we have uh when when we when we did
[57:13] in February, we have five and a half
[57:14] years durable long-term debt to to uh
[57:17] either refinance or to pay back. So, uh
[57:21] when we have plenty of coverage in our
[57:22] Bitcoin holdings for that is a hund00
[57:25] million and we own close to 500 million.
[57:28] So, we're pretty covered on that on that
[57:29] basis. And then um I think that
[57:33] um being 20% or so of our market cap or
[57:37] Bitcoin holdings is not um not not is
[57:40] kind of a reasonable level. Uh I think
[57:42] up to 30% is probably kind of the our
[57:45] comfort zone.
[57:47] Is that based on historical draw downs
[57:49] for Bitcoin or are there other factors
[57:51] that that go into um thinking about what
[57:54] the right leverage is? Mhm. Yeah, it's
[57:58] kind of a combination of things. Also,
[57:59] I'm also just someone who's um you know,
[58:02] closely followed leveraging companies
[58:04] over the years and just feeling kind of
[58:06] what's manageable and um I I think also
[58:10] just about kind of the kind of cash flow
[58:12] that we've created in the past as a
[58:14] company. uh our AIDA uh has declined a
[58:17] lot since we started this journey but uh
[58:20] we do have some products in the pipeline
[58:22] that we're hopeful will get us back you
[58:24] know someday to to where we were uh and
[58:28] nothing like immediately but I think
[58:30] that we have the potential to. So I
[58:32] think about that too over like a
[58:34] fiveyear span what kind of cash flow we
[58:35] could generate as a company.
[58:38] Awesome. Um, so, uh, the the other, uh,
[58:42] big recent news item was, uh, your new
[58:45] board member, Natalie Brunell. So,
[58:46] congratulations on bringing her on
[58:48] board. Thank you. Yeah, we're super
[58:50] excited. She's been so value added
[58:52] already. she just started but she's uh
[58:54] unbelievably helpful in terms of just
[58:57] you know introductions her network her
[59:00] experience her conviction in Bitcoin uh
[59:03] and her she's really passionate about
[59:05] her company and she really wants to
[59:08] succeed and it's just fantastic to have
[59:10] someone like that and that's an example
[59:12] I think of how what I was saying earlier
[59:14] kind of trying to build this
[59:15] relationship and connection with the
[59:17] Bitcoin community I think she's a great
[59:19] uh start for us in that category and I
[59:22] think she'll help us, you know, re
[59:24] improve our, you know, our our our
[59:26] connection. And you have that that
[59:28] shared journalism background as well.
[59:30] That's right. Yeah,
[59:33] that's great. Yeah. Um, I was always I
[59:35] was always I always preferred print
[59:37] journalism to uh being in front of a
[59:40] camera, you know, but yeah, definitely.
[59:43] Um, yeah. Are are there uh other things
[59:46] that that you feel like our audience
[59:48] should know about Similar before we uh
[59:49] sign off here at the top of the hour? Uh
[59:52] well, you know, one thing we didn't
[59:53] touch on for boards is another, you
[59:56] know, it was interesting when we um when
[59:58] we first bought most of our Bitcoin, we
[60:00] took most of our cash. I mean, when we
[60:02] first bought Bitcoin with most of our
[60:04] cash back a year ago, you know, Bitcoin
[60:07] went down a lot. Uh and it really tested
[60:10] our conviction. And it went down be
[60:11] mainly because there was an announcement
[60:13] like right after we finished buying
[60:15] Bitcoin with like $60 million of cash
[60:19] that uh Mount Gox was going to finally
[60:22] get distributed and it put a lot of
[60:24] pressure on Bitcoin. I don't know if it
[60:25] went down 20 or 25% pretty quickly and
[60:28] like we were saying earlier you know I
[60:30] had these board members who didn't
[60:31] really have history with Bitcoin and
[60:33] volatility. So you you know for other
[60:36] companies that are considering this you
[60:37] have to be ready for that. You have to
[60:39] be ready for that kind of conviction
[60:40] test. It can happen like right out of
[60:42] the gate. And and and and um you know,
[60:46] for us it was great because it made us
[60:47] really, you know, think is this really
[60:50] what we want to do? Do we want to buy
[60:51] more? You know, we'd have to really, you
[60:53] know, we we we don't we used most of our
[60:55] cash already. But, you know, it was it
[60:57] was great because it it it reinforced
[60:59] kind of that conviction we had.
[61:02] Yeah, that's uh that that's really great
[61:04] to hear because uh even on a personal
[61:06] level, it hurts when it goes down after
[61:08] you buy. Um but it we can't uh we can't
[61:13] time the market. I think that's uh an
[61:15] important lesson and and the volatility
[61:17] is a feature as well as you pointed out.
[61:20] For sure. Yeah. Well, Eric, thank you uh
[61:23] so much for coming on the Bitcoin for
[61:24] Corporation show. I really enjoyed our
