[00:00] Hello everyone. Thank you all for being
[00:02] here today. Thank you Bitcoin for
[00:04] corporations and thank you strategy for
[00:07] leading the Bitcoin movement for
[00:09] corporates around the world. I am
[00:11] Alexandriles, deputy CEO and director of
[00:14] Bitcoin strategy at the blockchain
[00:15] group, Europe's first Bitcoin treasury
[00:18] company listed on Euronex Growth Paris,
[00:20] ticker ALTBG. We have now 800 plus
[00:24] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and we just
[00:26] announced yesterday a new raise of more
[00:29] than 500 BTC to raise our Bitcoin
[00:32] holdings to more than 1,400
[00:35] BTC placing us in the top thank you
[00:40] placing us in the top 30 and close to 20
[00:45] uh Bitcoin treasury companies around the
[00:47] globe. So the context today is that
[00:50] Bitcoin is being adopting at scale by
[00:53] financial institutions and by
[00:54] governments around the world. Bitcoin is
[00:56] the top performing asset over the last
[00:59] 15 years. Bitcoin has seen the rise of
[01:01] the most successful ETF of all ETFs in
[01:05] history. And Bitcoin is the only asset
[01:08] the United States does not want to sell
[01:11] and plans to accumulate. And so as you
[01:13] all know the only thing better than
[01:16] Bitcoin is more Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[01:19] treasury companies can provide more
[01:21] Bitcoin by focusing on increasing
[01:24] Bitcoin per share over time. We have
[01:26] strategy for America and the world. A
[01:29] top performing stock over the world over
[01:31] the last five years. We have Metaplanet
[01:34] for Asia and for the world. top
[01:37] performing stock over the world last
[01:39] year with more than 2,000 3,000%
[01:42] performance and now as of today even
[01:45] 4,000 5,000%
[01:48] and now we have the blockchain group for
[01:50] Europe uh now more than 2,000%
[01:52] performance the number one stock
[01:56] performing traded in Paris out of all
[01:58] stock traded in Paris and the playbook
[02:02] is extremely simple the playbook is to
[02:04] raise capital, accumulate Bitcoin, hold
[02:07] the Bitcoin forever, don't sell the
[02:10] Bitcoin, and don't lose the Bitcoin. And
[02:13] most people struggle with just executing
[02:15] the playbook. And the difference and the
[02:17] premium is attributed to the market
[02:19] players that focus on increasing Bitcoin
[02:22] per share over time. Everything else is
[02:24] a distraction. And that's what I do
[02:26] every day. I'm I am 121% focused on
[02:31] increasing Bitcoin per share. And so
[02:34] what has done the focus on Bitcoin per
[02:37] share increase over time is that we have
[02:39] 10xed the number of SATs per share over
[02:42] the last seven months. And so a holder
[02:44] of the blockchain group had 40 sats per
[02:47] share back in December 2024. And today
[02:50] it has more than 400 sats per share and
[02:54] that's not even accounting for our last
[02:57] raise of yesterday. And so that's how
[03:00] you are able by focusing on Bitcoin to
[03:04] outperform Bitcoin by about 10x. And
[03:08] when you look at the performance, well,
[03:10] if you look, take a closer look, you see
[03:12] that over 1 month, 3 months, 6 months,
[03:16] you see that the blockchain group is
[03:18] literally following the exact steps of
[03:21] strategy and of metanet
[03:24] and even exceeding because we are of
[03:26] course benefiting from the fact that the
[03:28] playbook is being recognized in the
[03:30] world as we go. And the second
[03:32] conclusion of this chart is that you
[03:34] have MetaPlanet achieving the same
[03:36] results and even exceeding the results
[03:38] of strategy over five years but in one
[03:41] year. And if you take into account our
[03:43] stock performance as of today, we are
[03:46] realizing the same performance as
[03:48] MetaPlanet in one year but in seven
[03:50] months.
[03:52] And
[03:54] thank you. But this is not a
[03:56] competition. I want to emphasize the
[03:58] fact that we are not in a competition.
[04:00] We are in the same race and we are
[04:02] adopting the same asset. We are racing
[04:05] towards the Bitcoin standard and we are
[04:07] adopting it all as part of our treasury
[04:11] and the playbook is extremely simple but
[04:14] in fact you need a very strong and a
[04:17] very lean and focused team on Bitcoin
[04:20] and that's what we have at Smold at the
[04:22] blockchain group. We have as the
[04:24] chairman of the board John Deav the
[04:27] ex-president of a top performing asset
[04:29] manager in France. We have Ludovvic
[04:32] Lauron the co-founder of Capital Union
[04:34] Bank the largest bank in the Bahamas.
[04:37] And we have Philip Kazadle the the
[04:40] founder of one of the operational
[04:41] companies in France leading data and AI
[04:44] analytics and myself a Bitcoin
[04:46] maximalist dedicated to implementing the
[04:49] strategy playbook at European scale. As
[04:52] you can see, we have strategic investors
[04:55] among which Fulgrove Ventures, the
[04:57] largest Bitcoin VC fund around the
[05:00] world. We have legend Adam Bach, the
[05:03] only person mentioned in the white
[05:04] paper. He has now more than 10% of
[05:07] ownership in the blockchain group. and
[05:10] UTXO Management, the leading uh company
[05:13] arm, investment arm of Bitcoin magazine,
[05:16] investing in Bitcoin treasuries around
[05:18] the world and part of our growth as well
[05:22] since March of this year. And of course,
[05:25] last but not least, Tobam, a leading two
[05:27] billion French asset manager who has
[05:30] been to get together with us since
[05:32] December and since the launch of our
[05:34] strategy back in November, and who has
[05:37] published a paper about Bitcoin Treasury
[05:40] companies that I highly recommend you
[05:42] reading to understand how Bitcoin
[05:44] treasury companies can outperform
[05:46] Bitcoin with constant premiums. And so
[05:50] uh that's a mathematical paper that
[05:52] Tobam has published about strategy. And
[05:55] the conclusion is that if you are
[05:56] bullish on Bitcoin, you should be
[05:58] bullish on Bitcoin treasury companies.
[06:00] And if you are bullish on Bitcoin
[06:01] treasury companies, you may want to have
[06:04] a look at early stage Bitcoin treasury
[06:06] companies. And so assembling this team
[06:09] has allowed us to become Europe's first
[06:11] and largest Bitcoin treasury company
[06:14] with operational activities in data
[06:16] analytics, AI, consulting development
[06:19] and as well blockchain development that
[06:21] we intend over time to pivot towards
[06:24] Bitcoin as a consulting activity and of
[06:27] course as part of our securities
[06:29] issuances.
[06:31] LTBG is now entering its acceleration
[06:34] phase. I will come back to this later on
[06:37] about about our capital raising
[06:38] operations. But we have over 7 months
[06:42] 100x our volumes. We started with a
[06:45] market cap of 15 million. We are now at
[06:48] a market cap of more than 300 million.
[06:50] It's even 1 billion market cap if you
[06:53] take into account the fully diluted
[06:55] shares. And we are the number one stock
[06:57] performance in France. We are the number
[06:59] one stock discussed in the forums for
[07:02] French investors. In France, we are
[07:04] literally the only solution for French
[07:07] investors that want to have a Bitcoin
[07:09] allocation into their tax droppers in
[07:13] France that have exemptions. And we have
[07:16] generated 861%
[07:19] BTC yield year to date. That is not even
[07:21] accounting for the 600 BTC that we are
[07:25] about to add to our balance sheet to
[07:27] raise towards 1,400
[07:30] BTC.
[07:33] My body
[07:37] [Music]
[08:03] So what are the key milestone of our
[08:05] Bitcoin treasury company strategy? We
[08:08] started the strategy back on November 5,
[08:11] 2024. And we have raised€3.5 million
[08:14] euros at 40 to 70% of premium on top of
[08:19] the 20-day moving average. And after
[08:21] this, we have wanted to scale the model
[08:24] and ask for the permission to raise up
[08:26] to 300 million euros of capital. And two
[08:30] weeks after we have announced the first
[08:32] worldwide BTC denominated convertible
[08:36] depth, which is in fact taking the best
[08:39] out of the convertible depth that we're
[08:41] leveraging strategy, but removing credit
[08:44] risk for the company and basically
[08:46] allowing us to raise capital at
[08:49] infinitum through an SPV in Luxembourg
[08:52] on a BTC standard. We have completely
[08:55] skipped fiat and our investors subscribe
[08:58] directly in Bitcoin. We receive Bitcoin.
[09:01] We add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The
[09:03] stock goes up as a result of the BTC
[09:06] yield that we generate. And we extremely
[09:09] fast are able to have the conversion
[09:13] strike price reached. And what we have
[09:15] demonstrated is the stock performance
[09:18] that you can see from March this year
[09:20] and towards now. And that stock
[09:24] performance since the issuance of the
[09:26] convertible depths back in March is now
[09:28] 800%.
[09:30] And after this 50 million raise that we
[09:32] did with Fuggo Ventures, Adam Back, UTXO
[09:34] management, Tobam and Dudik Shaluron, uh
[09:38] we have uh now in about two months
[09:41] raised about 100 million of capital. We
[09:45] have raised through equity at premiums
[09:47] to the stock price in ATM like private
[09:50] placements. Of course, there is a delay
[09:52] and sometimes people ask me why is is
[09:55] there a discount appearing with the
[09:57] stock price? Well, the the fact of the
[09:59] matter is uh to conduct the private
[10:01] placement in France, it takes about one
[10:04] week, two week between the
[10:05] administrative processes receiving the
[10:07] funds and so on. But the stock price is
[10:09] redefined at the moment with the
[10:11] investor on a on a on ATM like structure
[10:15] that has allowed us to raise about 20
[10:17] million euros and that has allowed us to
[10:20] have generally about one trillion asset
[10:23] manager in Europe that is now a
[10:25] shareholder of the blockchain group
[10:27] together with Tobam and we we also have
[10:29] red shield as part of the shareholders.
[10:32] And so uh yesterday we announced another
[10:35] round of our BTC denominated depth that
[10:39] has allowed us to raise uh 60 million
[10:42] euros and towards acquiring about 600
[10:46] BTC.
[10:49] So the price is in euros is fine and
[10:53] actually we should update the the
[10:55] numbers because uh today we did again
[10:57] plus 30%. But what is most interesting
[11:00] is to look at the price in sets because
[11:02] euros is going to the ground and what is
[11:05] important is the purchasing power in
[11:07] terms of sats in terms of bitcoin and if
[11:10] you look at it the price of the share at
[11:12] the beginning of the year was about 200
[11:15] sats and now the price of the share is
[11:18] about 2,000 sats and so what this means
[11:20] is we have outperformed bitcoin by about
[11:23] 10x what this means is the same number
[11:26] of sats give you 10x less shares today
[11:29] to buy of the blockchain group. And what
[11:32] this means is that by acquiring a
[11:34] Bitcoin treasury company, it's literally
[11:37] the best risk adjusted way to outperform
[11:40] Bitcoin over the long term. I'm not
[11:42] talking about short term and because
[11:44] it's extremely volatile, but I'm talking
[11:46] about long-term strategy.
[11:49] And this performance, we have realized
[11:52] it without even starting to do ATM like
[11:56] programs like Metanet. We have not even
[11:58] started to do convertible depth at scale
[12:02] like strategy and we have not even
[12:04] started to do public offerings. And so
[12:07] that shows you just the level of demand
[12:09] that there is today over the world for
[12:11] Bitcoin treasury companies and the level
[12:14] of demand that you have in France today
[12:16] from French investors and the global
[12:18] market for uh Bitcoin treasury
[12:21] companies. And we are not even yet
[12:24] having a ticker in the US. And so we
[12:27] have seen what that has done with
[12:28] MetaPlanet. We've been asked to do and
[12:30] of course we are considering it.
[12:34] So what about our capital raising cap
[12:36] capacity? Over five months we have
[12:38] raised 50 million and over the last two
[12:41] months and to be more precise over the
[12:42] last three weeks since strategy world um
[12:45] last month we have been able to raise
[12:47] 100 million and so that has uh about 100
[12:51] million euros of capital raised and on
[12:54] June 10th we are asking our general
[12:56] meeting of shareholders to approve a new
[12:59] capital raising capacity to scale of
[13:02] more than 10 billion euros uh to go even
[13:06] faster.
[13:08] If we look at LTBG returns on Bitcoin
[13:12] standard era basis, what you can
[13:15] conclude is that if you are not adopting
[13:17] Bitcoin on your balance sheet, you are
[13:20] going to the ground as a stable coin.
[13:22] And that is the case of all these major
[13:25] companies around the world in the US in
[13:28] France, Hermes, L'Oreal and so on. If
[13:31] you don't have Bitcoin on the balance
[13:33] sheet, you are just valued on top of
[13:35] your cash flows and your cash flows are
[13:36] in fiat and fiat is going to zero. So
[13:38] you are worth nothing in Bitcoin terms.
[13:40] This chart, if you were going to put
[13:42] that on the Bitcoin standard, everything
[13:44] would be red because everything is
[13:46] underperforming Bitcoin and 99% of asset
[13:49] managers are out are underperforming
[13:52] Bitcoin. And the only companies that are
[13:54] basically able to sustain an
[13:56] outperformance of Bitcoin are Bitcoin
[13:58] Treasury companies. And the blockchain
[14:00] group is Europe's leading Bitcoin
[14:02] treasury company. How have we done that?
[14:05] Well, we have 20xed our number of
[14:07] Bitcoin on the balance sheet since
[14:10] November 2024. We went from 15 BTC to 40
[14:13] BTC to about 580 BTC added to the
[14:18] balance sheet with about 620 BTC, 847
[14:23] BTC. And now uh well when we will be
[14:26] announcing the completion of our latest
[14:29] transaction more than 1,400 BTC. An even
[14:33] more interesting chart is the chart
[14:35] showing how we are able to monetize the
[14:38] premium. What you can see is that we are
[14:41] one of the highest uh premiums
[14:44] generating company with raises at about
[14:48] 5 to 10x premiums over the over the net
[14:52] asset value of the bitcoin. And what
[14:54] shows you this chart is that we are able
[14:56] to monetize the premium in about four to
[14:59] five months. And our benchmark is about
[15:02] six to 16 months. Well, when you have
[15:04] four to five months, when you are able
[15:07] to monetize and to have the investment
[15:09] of your investors monetized after four
[15:11] to five months and after that it's just
[15:14] more BTC yield where that's extremely
[15:16] accritive strategy. And how do you get
[15:18] that? Well, you focus on Bitcoin. You
[15:21] put all of your long-term capital into
[15:22] Bitcoin and you focus every day, every
[15:25] morning, every night, every day on BTC
[15:28] yield as much as possible and in the
[15:32] most accive way and as fast as possible.
[15:35] So what this shows in terms of the
[15:38] balance sheet is that the BTC euro gain
[15:41] that we have been able to generate uh
[15:44] over the first six months of the year is
[15:47] now 25x of the net result of the company
[15:51] for the whole last year and so the net
[15:54] result for the operational company was
[15:56] 1.3 million last year and the Bitcoin
[15:59] BTC euro gain for uh the first two
[16:02] quarters is already about 30 million.
[16:07] So we are really on a Bitcoin standard
[16:09] and we are really a Bitcoin treasury
[16:11] company securitizing Bitcoin for capital
[16:14] markets and to meet the global demand.
[16:17] And we have bold ambitions. We have
[16:19] published our plan for the next eight
[16:21] years. We ambition to acquire as much as
[16:24] 1% of the total BTC supply. Of course
[16:28] that's an ambitious goal. It's taking
[16:30] into assumption about a 30% Bitcoin
[16:33] kagger which is realizing today about 30
[16:36] to 90% over the last five to five to 10
[16:39] years and so taking this assumption we
[16:42] would be able if we execute the plan to
[16:45] go to about 1% of the total BTC supply
[16:48] and if we execute this plan if Bitcoin
[16:51] reaches about one to two million dollars
[16:54] or euros by the next four to eight years
[16:57] we could have the potential to becoming
[16:59] Europe's largest publicly traded
[17:02] corporation. Thank you very much, Ola.
