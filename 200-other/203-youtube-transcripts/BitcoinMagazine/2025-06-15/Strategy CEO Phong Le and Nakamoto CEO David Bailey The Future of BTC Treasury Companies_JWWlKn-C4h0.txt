[00:00] Hello everyone. Uh when when I started
[00:02] learning about Bitcoin 12 years ago, I
[00:05] never thought that I'd be in a room here
[00:07] uh presenting about uh the most
[00:10] successful company in the world that
[00:13] happens to be 100% powered by Bitcoin.
[00:15] So, it's a tremendous honor to be here.
[00:18] Um I'm going to bring up uh Fong Lee,
[00:20] the CEO of Strategy.
[00:23] [Applause]
[00:34] and David Bailey, the CEO of
[00:37] [Applause]
[00:44] Nakamoto. All right, let's Oh, there
[00:47] David was getting his coffee. Very good.
[00:53] All right, let's uh get the conversation
[00:55] started.
[00:57] Um, so first question for for you, Fong.
[01:01] Uh, and I had to update this question
[01:02] several times as uh your company was
[01:05] acquiring more and more Bitcoin. Uh, you
[01:07] you've got now um
[01:10] 580,250 Bitcoin. uh
[01:16] which represents almost 3% of the 21
[01:21] million Bitcoin. Um what do you say to
[01:24] those who
[01:26] uh they they're corporations that are
[01:28] looking at what you're doing and a
[01:31] thought they might have is we're too
[01:34] late. Uh that strategies already
[01:37] succeeding here and so we can't pivot to
[01:40] what they're doing. we've got to find
[01:41] something else. Uh what what what comes
[01:44] to mind on that?
[01:47] Well, last year when we were sitting uh
[01:50] in this forum,
[01:52] uh Semar Scientific and Metaplanet
[01:57] announced that they were going to adopt
[01:59] a Bitcoin treasury strategy. And at that
[02:03] point in time, maybe there were five
[02:04] companies. And now with Nakamoto and
[02:07] others, we're up to 80 companies. 80
[02:10] companies still represents, you know, in
[02:13] the world of four million companies, a
[02:15] pretty small percentage of a percentage
[02:18] fraction. So I don't think about it as
[02:21] what is the percentage of 21 million
[02:23] Bitcoin. I think about it as a
[02:25] percentage of companies in the world
[02:27] that have a Bitcoin treasury strategy.
[02:30] And we are incredibly early. Let's say
[02:34] next year we're sitting here and it's
[02:35] 800 companies. It's still incredibly
[02:37] early. And then I say, do you really
[02:40] think about it as are you too early or
[02:42] are you too late? Or do you think about
[02:44] you have all this excess cash on your
[02:46] balance sheet earning whatever it is 2%
[02:49] you can decapize yourself and give it
[02:52] back to your
[02:54] shareholders or you can actually make
[02:56] money off of your balance sheet. And
[02:58] isn't that really how you should think
[03:00] about all of you hear Bitcoin? Uh often
[03:03] as retailers, as individuals, you made a
[03:06] decision to put Bitcoin on your balance
[03:07] sheet. Did you say to yourself, well,
[03:10] you know, Satoshi's got a lot of
[03:12] Bitcoin, Michael Sailor's got a lot of
[03:14] Bitcoin. The Winklvi have a lot of
[03:16] Bitcoin. Therefore, I shouldn't have any
[03:18] Bitcoin. So, so to me, it's a very
[03:20] similar thought process. If you believe
[03:22] in Bitcoin as a superior
[03:25] uh form of capital, the apex form of
[03:28] capital, digital capital, why wouldn't
[03:30] you want to? And I don't think of it as
[03:32] a competition. I don't say, "Oh, David,
[03:34] you just entered with Nakamoto, man. Now
[03:36] we're at at, you know, we're at odds.
[03:39] Better watch out. We're coming for you.
[03:40] Like like, you know, we go out and and
[03:43] and I like what what Simon's been doing
[03:46] with MetaPlanet and the value that
[03:48] they've created for their shareholders.
[03:49] I don't look at that and say, "You won,
[03:52] I lost." I looked at that and say, "We
[03:54] all win." And so it it's it's I I don't
[03:58] think it's ever really too late. But you
[04:00] have to think of what is the
[04:01] competition. The competition isn't each
[04:03] other. The competition is fiat currency.
[04:05] the competition is US Treasury bills,
[04:08] the competition is not earning something
[04:10] for your shareholders.
[04:13] And so there's there is a sense of
[04:15] urgency around this. And uh David, I
[04:18] know that you've been uh raising uh
[04:20] capital for Nakamoto. Um when you're
[04:23] talking with institutional investors, um
[04:26] do they see this Bitcoin bull market
[04:30] ahead of them or behind them? and uh
[04:33] what's their sense of urgency of putting
[04:34] money to work? So, first off, I just
[04:37] want to say this is my first I've been
[04:38] in the back doing deals all morning. So,
[04:41] this is my first session to come to.
[04:43] This is wild. You know, tomorrow we're
[04:44] expecting three times more people than
[04:46] today. So, uh you know, there's some
[04:50] seats I think over here for the people
[04:51] that are standing, but I mean, yeah, you
[04:53] can feel the energy here and the
[04:54] excitement. Uh I would say that the this
[04:57] same energy is is be really affecting
[05:00] all investor classes. Um, you know, just
[05:03] today we've underwritten three new
[05:05] Bitcoin treasury companies in three new
[05:07] countries. Uh, you know, there's there's
[05:11] there's 800 companies. I think uh, as
[05:14] Fong mentioned, there could be 800
[05:16] companies buying Bitcoin. You can you
[05:17] can run the numbers and it's like right
[05:19] now there's roughly 800,000 bitcoins
[05:21] that are owned by publicly traded
[05:22] companies. If there's 800 companies a
[05:26] year from now, which I think is a
[05:27] conservative number, honestly, if
[05:29] there's 800 companies a year from now,
[05:31] and they each own a thousand bitcoins,
[05:33] which is peanuts relative to some of
[05:35] these Bitcoin treasuries that are out
[05:37] there, that doubles the amount of
[05:39] Bitcoin being held by publicly public
[05:41] companies. So, you can you can look at
[05:44] how much Bitcoin's available for sale on
[05:46] on exchanges. It's it's singledigit
[05:48] millions. It's one two million bitcoins
[05:50] that are available for sale. Can you
[05:52] imagine a thousand companies or 10,000
[05:55] companies in the marketplace bidding
[05:58] every single day? I mean, the price of
[06:00] Bitcoin here is just going to absolutely
[06:03] run. So, it's very exciting. And I and
[06:06] you know, raising the money for
[06:09] Nakamoto. Sorry. We just raised $710
[06:13] million. Um, I guess because we're a
[06:15] public company, I won't share anything
[06:16] that that hasn't happened yet, but uh,
[06:19] uh, we raised 510 million of it in in
[06:21] equity investment. We raised 200 million
[06:23] of it in in debt. You know, I I come
[06:27] from the Bitcoin world. I'm not a
[06:28] capital markets person. I I'm not, you
[06:30] know, Michael Sailor or Fong. And so,
[06:34] uh, you know, I'm not used to taking
[06:36] phone calls and in 10 minutes or 15
[06:38] minutes having a hedge fund commit 20,
[06:40] 30, $50 million. The amount of money
[06:43] flowing right now from Wall Street is
[06:45] unbelievable. Unbelievable. And there
[06:48] are so many deals in the market right
[06:49] now that are getting fully funded where
[06:51] I'm hearing people upsizing transactions
[06:53] from 50 million to 100 million to 200
[06:55] million to 300 million. It is
[06:57] unbelievable. And I think it's something
[06:59] that the Bitcoin treasury companies have
[07:01] really unlocked is like there's a large
[07:04] a large investor class in every single
[07:07] geography on the planet. And each of
[07:09] these deals, you know, if like for
[07:11] example, we backed this one company,
[07:12] Smarter Web Company in in the UK. Tiny
[07:15] company. I I like it IPOed $3 million
[07:18] valuation. It's trading on the the least
[07:21] liquid third tier um
[07:24] exchange. That stock has run from 3
[07:27] million to $200 million market
[07:30] cap. Every investor in the UK is now
[07:33] aware of what's going on here. every
[07:35] investor in the UK is now watching this
[07:37] saying, "What in the hell is happening
[07:38] with these stocks?" And so, like, it's
[07:41] capturing the attention of the the
[07:43] investor class. And if you can capture
[07:45] people's attention, that's how you drive
[07:47] liquidity into into this asset category
[07:49] into the securization of Bitcoin as a
[07:51] concept. And so, I I I really think like
[07:54] this phenomenon is just beginning. And
[07:56] we're going to have a Bitcoin treasury
[07:57] company in every country, in every
[08:00] market, on every exchange within 12
[08:02] months.
[08:04] [Applause]
[08:11] Fong, back to you on uh the Financial
[08:13] Times. They came out with a really funny
[08:15] video. Uh they were comparing uh Bitcoin
[08:18] to Teeth. I I don't I didn't quite
[08:20] understand that part, but um you know,
[08:22] they they they overemphasize uh the or
[08:26] at least they they didn't cover the
[08:27] benefits of Bitcoin. They only talked
[08:29] about the volatility and the risk.
[08:31] What's the risk of a corporate not
[08:33] holding any Bitcoin?
[08:36] I I So, so yeah, that the teeth thing
[08:38] has has really become a meme and and I
[08:40] like my teeth, but I don't think you
[08:42] want my teeth. Um, nor does anyone else
[08:44] want anyone else's teeth and and then
[08:47] the tooth fairy would be really rich if
[08:48] to tooth was teeth was the thing. Um,
[08:52] look, the the big risk is is and I I had
[08:55] this conversation a lot of times, right?
[08:56] Like the the true sign of wealth for an
[09:00] individual is when you stop chasing your
[09:03] salary and you stop chasing income and
[09:06] stop trying to make a h 100,000 or a
[09:08] million or $10 million a year and you
[09:11] start making money off of your savings,
[09:13] right? Passive income, right? You put a
[09:15] million dollars in the bank, you buy
[09:17] Strife and you get 10% yield on that.
[09:20] You make a $100,000 off of that. You put
[09:22] $10 million into Strife and you make a
[09:25] million dollars off of it, right? It's
[09:27] making money off of your balance sheet.
[09:29] And for decades and decades, what people
[09:33] have been taught with public companies
[09:36] is to optimize your income statement,
[09:38] right? To the extent that the the
[09:41] multiples of valuation of most companies
[09:44] is based off of a revenue multiple or an
[09:47] earnings multiple or off of earnings per
[09:50] share. Uh and what you do with your
[09:53] savings is you give it away. You go
[09:55] ahead and you you buy back stock. You
[09:58] pay it out in the form of a dividend. Uh
[10:01] and you decapize the company. Well, what
[10:04] works for individuals should work for
[10:06] corporations, right? The best thing for
[10:08] a corporation is to have an operating
[10:11] business that's growing and it's doing
[10:13] well. take the excess cash off of that
[10:17] operating business and put it into some
[10:20] form of capital that you know is going
[10:23] to appreciate faster than your cost of
[10:25] capital or faster than the S&P 500 call
[10:29] 11%. And probably the reason most
[10:32] corporations haven't gone down that path
[10:34] is that didn't exist. It hasn't existed
[10:36] for the last hundred years. Well, we all
[10:38] know Bitcoin comes along and it
[10:40] appreciates conservatively at 50% a
[10:43] year, right? Uh, and that's 50% versus
[10:46] 11%. You're making 39% above your cost
[10:49] of capital. Why would you ever go ahead
[10:53] and give it back in the form of a
[10:54] dividend? Why wouldn't you instead raise
[10:56] more capital, which is what we've done,
[10:58] and take a take advantage of that
[11:00] arbitrage? And so the cost of a company
[11:03] not doing that is you're basically only
[11:06] taking half of what you have which is
[11:09] your income statement to optimize and
[11:10] you're ignoring all the other
[11:12] opportunity. It becomes an opportunity
[11:14] cost essentially. Uh and I think
[11:16] companies are starting to realize this
[11:18] left and right, right? Like you know
[11:20] this makes sense and it's Bitcoin that
[11:22] powers this. It's reasonable that there
[11:24] hasn't been anyone talking about this
[11:26] because Bitcoin hasn't existed except
[11:28] for, you know, the last the last 18 or
[11:31] 17 years. So I I think this is the
[11:34] opportunity today and David and others
[11:36] are finding this opportunity and it's so
[11:39] early that every company that identifies
[11:43] this opportunity is going to create
[11:45] tremendous wealth for themselves, for
[11:48] their employees, for their investors.
[11:50] Just like the definition of wealth for
[11:52] an individual is to make money off of
[11:55] your savings.
[11:56] [Music]
[12:02] [Music]
[12:27] I have a question. When when strategy
[12:28] was added to the the NASDAQ 100, do you
[12:31] know which company was removed?
[12:35] You know, I actually do and and I'm not
[12:37] going to I'm I'm I'm not going to necess
[12:40] you can go find out what company was
[12:42] removed, but it was actually one of the
[12:43] other fastest growing companies in the
[12:46] NASDAQ uh to overall, but they were
[12:49] removed for other reasons. Yeah. So, I
[12:52] you know, when you talk about
[12:53] opportunity cost, you know, there's one
[12:56] S&P 500 company, there's a couple, I
[12:59] guess, NASDAQ 100 companies. There'll be
[13:01] five, 10 NASDAQ 100 companies. every
[13:04] every company that gets added to the
[13:06] index that's that's running the Bitcoin
[13:08] strategy means there's one company's
[13:10] getting removed from the index and if
[13:12] I'm on the board of that company I'm
[13:14] asking myself why are we being removed
[13:16] from this index who are these guys what
[13:18] are they doing so I think at some point
[13:21] in time you either have to embrace
[13:23] Bitcoin or incrementally step by step
[13:25] you're going to start getting kicked out
[13:26] of the indexes that you want to be
[13:27] included into yeah you know it's it's an
[13:30] interesting point I haven't thought
[13:31] about it that way I I've talked to and
[13:33] so is Mike and others quite a few
[13:34] corporate boards and that isn't
[13:36] unfortunately how they think, right?
[13:38] like and that's part of the challenge
[13:40] which is why I love seeing new companies
[13:43] created with new boards with people who
[13:46] understand Bitcoin the existing
[13:48] establishment of publicly traded
[13:51] companies the ex you know if you look at
[13:53] the profile of a board a typical board
[13:56] of a uh NASDAQ 100 company right these
[14:01] are largely speaking um white males in
[14:06] the 60 to 70 you know year old range who
[14:09] are brought onto the board because they
[14:11] have an experience or a career in
[14:14] corporate finance or in law or
[14:17] potentially in the operations of that
[14:19] business. These are not and and and
[14:21] they've been extremely successful,
[14:23] right? But they're not the types of
[14:24] folks whose profiles scream, "Hey, I
[14:27] love Bitcoin." Uh and so there's an
[14:29] education process and there's also going
[14:31] to be a board turnover process to people
[14:33] who are Bitcoin forward. And I I think
[14:36] that's going to I I think it's hard to
[14:39] ignore the returns of Bitcoin treasury
[14:43] companies. It's hard to ignore what's
[14:44] happened with strategy, what's happened
[14:46] with Metaplanet. And I think ultimately
[14:49] the role of an organiza of a publicly
[14:52] traded company of the board, they have a
[14:54] fidiciary responsibility, their
[14:56] shareholders, right? and and you know
[14:59] getting removed from the NASDAQ 100 is
[15:00] one thing but seeing that you have
[15:02] returns of 2 3% when Bitcoin treasury
[15:06] companies have returns of 50 60% a year
[15:10] people are going to have to wake up to
[15:11] that and and I think these types of
[15:13] events and and I think the retail
[15:15] shareholder base by the way right like
[15:17] you elect right the retail shareholders
[15:20] actually elect who's on the board of
[15:22] companies right the institutionals do
[15:25] too um but we have an opportunity to
[15:27] speak up and get people on the board who
[15:29] are more forward thinking. And I did not
[15:31] mean to be agist or, you know, uh, you
[15:34] know, with my comment there, but it's
[15:36] time to turn over some of these boards.
[15:39] If anybody needs a board director, come
[15:41] find me afterwards. Always happy to to
[15:44] serve uh for the greater good of
[15:46] Bitcoin. Um, so David, I mean, on that
[15:49] point, uh, do you think that, uh,
[15:51] President Trump's executive order
[15:53] establishing the strategic Bitcoin
[15:55] reserve, uh, helps move the needle with
[15:57] these, uh, conservative, maybe risk
[16:00] averse, uh, board members that, uh, hey,
[16:04] this actually has a government stamp of
[16:05] approval on it. Absolutely. In fact, we
[16:08] just underwrote a deal in a
[16:10] country where uh after FTX and uh Luna
[16:16] exploded, they had gone extremely
[16:18] conservative in the country on uh the
[16:21] industry and and were wanting to prevent
[16:23] things from coming to the capital
[16:24] market. And post the President Trump
[16:27] embracing it, they now feel like they
[16:30] are um misaligned or out of step with US
[16:34] policy. And so now they're changing
[16:37] their their the the I don't know what
[16:40] the right words are the the um appetite
[16:44] I guess for allowing these instruments
[16:46] to come to the capital market in their
[16:47] country um just so that they can be
[16:49] aligned with the US. You know I think in
[16:52] terms of the likelihood of the US buying
[16:54] Bitcoin this year I think it's pretty
[16:56] solid. I think it's pretty good and I'm
[16:58] I'm very interested to hear what the
[16:59] vice president has to say tomorrow.
[17:01] We're actually going to be hosting him
[17:02] in just a couple hours uh for a round
[17:04] table with uh uh some of the biggest
[17:06] Bitcoin leaders including Michael
[17:08] Sailor. And um you know, we are just
[17:11] like uh we need to have shareholders,
[17:13] retail shareholders advocating to boards
[17:16] that we want them to put Bitcoin on the
[17:17] balance sheet. We need to have US voters
[17:19] advocating to presidents and vice
[17:21] presidents that they want Bitcoin on the
[17:23] balance sheet of the country. I think in
[17:25] in a sense what's happening on the
[17:26] nation state level is the exact same
[17:28] thing that's happening on the corporate
[17:29] level. you know, the strategic Bitcoin
[17:31] reserve is Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[17:32] of a country. You know, uh uh the the
[17:35] Bit Bond is the convertible note of, you
[17:40] know, the the corporate world. And so
[17:41] we're watching the same phenomenon play
[17:43] out. Um I I know for a fact there are
[17:47] multiple countries right now that are
[17:49] buying Bitcoin. Uh you know, I had a
[17:51] conversation with the with the you know,
[17:53] I mean, strategy is really the poster
[17:55] child of of all of all this that's
[17:57] happening. I mean I we we regularly go
[17:59] into meetings now with countries and we
[18:00] pitch them look at what strategy's been
[18:03] able to do for their company. You can do
[18:04] this for your country and they love it.
[18:06] So uh you know I think um you know we're
[18:10] at a very interesting inflection point
[18:11] where this moves from the corporate to
[18:13] the sovereign and it's not just on the
[18:14] nation state level but it's on the city
[18:16] level it's on the state level. It's on
[18:17] the federal level. Um and that is really
[18:20] just beginning.
[18:22] Um, Fong, the the Bitcoin ETPs, uh, like
[18:25] IBID, they they've had record inflows.
[18:28] Uh, they've outperformed any new ETP
[18:31] product out there. Um, how how do you h
[18:35] what sets corporate Bitcoin treasuries
[18:37] apart from these more passive vehicles?
[18:41] Yeah. So, so I think it's multiple.
[18:43] First of all, ETPs are are are Bitcoin
[18:46] specific ETPS are a great invention,
[18:49] right? They started at the beginning of
[18:50] last year and they've been great to
[18:52] support the Bitcoin market, but you're
[18:55] essentially paying a fee to own Bitcoin
[18:57] and have easy access to Bitcoin as if it
[18:59] was a spot instrument, right? Which is a
[19:01] great thing for a certain type of
[19:02] investor. Uh what you get with Bitcoin
[19:05] treasury companies strategy included and
[19:07] others that are out there uh is one you
[19:11] get access to Bitcoin yield and Bitcoin
[19:14] gain defined as
[19:16] non-dilutive additions to the Bitcoin
[19:19] holdings uh on a per share basis. Right?
[19:23] And so you can't do that if if you buy
[19:26] uh $100,000 worth of a
[19:30] Bitcoin ETP like IBIT, you have
[19:33] $100,000 worth of Bitcoin, right? So
[19:37] about one Bitcoin and that's all you'll
[19:38] ever have. uh if you buy $100,000 worth
[19:42] of MSTR and MSDR produces a Bitcoin
[19:46] yield of 15% then after the course of a
[19:49] year you actually have
[19:51] $115,000 worth of Bitcoin essentially.
[19:54] And how can we do that? We do that by
[19:56] issuing equity right through an ATM on
[19:59] MSTR. We can do that through issuing
[20:01] debt. We've done convertible debt. We've
[20:03] done secured debt. And we can do that
[20:05] through issuing preferred notes. By the
[20:08] way, all of those things when we first
[20:10] started doing them in 2020, Bitcoin
[20:12] backed convertible notes, Bitcoinbacked
[20:15] uh ATM issuances, and Bitcoin back
[20:18] preferred notes were the first time
[20:20] anyone's ever done those things. So,
[20:22] what are you doing? You're basically,
[20:23] it's a lever bet on Bitcoin, but it's
[20:25] also a bet on a company that is going to
[20:28] continue to innovate to provide Bitcoin
[20:31] backed securities. None of that happens
[20:34] when you buy just a Bitcoin ETP. It's a
[20:36] very different uh investment portfolio
[20:39] and and maybe you want to have 10% of a
[20:41] Bitcoin ETP or 90% of of MSTR or or
[20:47] other options out there. Um but what the
[20:51] companies give you is the ability to
[20:53] lever up the ability to produce Bitcoin
[20:55] yield and the ability to innovate and
[20:58] come up with ideas of any things you've
[21:00] never heard of essentially at zero fee.
[21:03] And h how do you balance that leverage
[21:06] with Bitcoin's volatility uh from a
[21:09] riskmanagement perspective?
[21:11] Yeah, Andrew talked about some of this.
[21:13] First of all, we think about it all the
[21:15] time, right? We're very thoughtful and
[21:18] and and very aware of uh our capital
[21:21] stack and how to make sure we do it in a
[21:24] way that we can withstand generally
[21:26] four-year Bitcoin cycles, right? So for
[21:29] example, if you look at our convertible
[21:31] notes, they're fairly longdated, right?
[21:33] Five, six, seven years in some cases. I
[21:36] think at this point in time, our average
[21:38] maturity on a convertible note uh on
[21:40] convertible notes is about three and a
[21:42] half years, right? So that's step one.
[21:44] You don't want to take on debt that you
[21:46] have to repay next year, right? Because
[21:49] naturally we realize that Bitcoin is
[21:51] very volatile. The second thing we did
[21:53] is we invented the preferred perpetual
[21:56] preferred Bitcoin market. And and
[21:58] there's a couple of interesting things
[21:59] there. One is perpetual. We never have
[22:01] to pay it back, right? And so it's
[22:04] fairly isolated then from Bitcoin
[22:06] downturns and Bitcoin upturns, right?
[22:09] Yes, we have to pay a dividend on it,
[22:11] but the dividend we pay on that is 10%
[22:13] versus if we had issued equity, it's
[22:15] 100% dilution. This is 10%. You know,
[22:18] from that point of view, right? And so
[22:20] everything we do, everything we invent,
[22:23] all of the equities, uh all the ATM
[22:26] equity capital that we raise, all of the
[22:28] debt capital that we raise a preferred
[22:30] notes, we're always thinking about what
[22:32] is the duration, what is the risk, and
[22:34] how do we make sure that we're in a
[22:36] situation that we feel comfortable with
[22:38] our capital structure. Uh and yeah,
[22:40] we've had to invent things that go along
[22:42] that do that. And what's really cool is
[22:44] when we see new companies going in the
[22:46] market, right? Like and they start
[22:47] thinking about the same things. They
[22:49] say, "How do we issue an ATM?" Well,
[22:51] MetPlanet does can't do that in Japan,
[22:53] but they issue warrants instead, right?
[22:55] How do we raise capital through
[22:57] convertible bonds, right? We've created
[22:59] the market for that, and so other
[23:00] companies are able to do that. No one
[23:02] else has done the preferred note yet,
[23:04] and frankly, we've only been about four
[23:06] months in the market with them. Uh but
[23:08] they're the most successful preferred
[23:10] notes that have ever been issued uh in
[23:12] the last century. Right? Right now, if
[23:14] you had invested in Striker Strife since
[23:17] the its inception, you got a 25% return
[23:20] and a 10% yield. Think about that for a
[23:24] minute. What else can you invest in
[23:25] where I'm going to give you back 10%
[23:27] every single year in cash on a quarterly
[23:30] basis and on a one quarter you re return
[23:34] 25%. It's crazy. It's awesome. and we as
[23:38] a company then are able to turn around
[23:40] invest that into Bitcoin and not ever
[23:43] have to pay it back as long as we're
[23:44] paying the 10% yield. So those are the
[23:46] types of things you're creating and
[23:48] inventing that then you know look IBIT's
[23:51] great buying Bitcoin is great right but
[23:54] if you want something that gives you
[23:55] more upside right and and you get the
[23:59] advantage of the management team and and
[24:01] all that comes along with that right if
[24:02] you see that as advantage that then I
[24:04] think there's a lot of
[24:06] differences can I can I give a cheat
[24:08] sheet for how people in this room can do
[24:11] it look up all the public filings for
[24:13] Micro Strategy
[24:15] uh when you talk to the the banker on
[24:17] the other side, go deal term by deal
[24:19] term and copy off the their term sheets
[24:21] and just say we need at least what Micro
[24:23] Strategy gets because they have the best
[24:25] financings that anyone's done. So that's
[24:27] the cheat sheet. Okay. Um can I also
[24:30] just say thank you to strategy for
[24:33] kickstarting this entire this entire
[24:35] movement? I mean it's pretty freaking
[24:39] incredible.
[24:42] Thank
[24:47] you. It's a visionary company uh led by
[24:51] a set of visionary leaders. We heard
[24:53] from Andrew Kang. We we heard from Fong
[24:55] Lee. Uh next up, we're going to be
[24:57] hearing from Mr.
[25:05] Sailor.
