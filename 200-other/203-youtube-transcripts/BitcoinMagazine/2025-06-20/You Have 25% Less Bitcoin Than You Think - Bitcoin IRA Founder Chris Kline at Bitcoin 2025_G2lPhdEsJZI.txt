[00:00] Hello everybody. Welcome to Vegas 2025
[00:04] here with Bitcoin Magazine on the live
[00:05] desk presented by Mara um Juan G,
[00:08] business reporter at Bitcoin Magazine
[00:10] and I am joined by Chris Klein uh
[00:13] co-founder of Bitcoin. How are you doing
[00:14] today? Great, great, great to see. Nice
[00:16] to meet you today, Juan. What a what
[00:17] kind of energy. I mean, this is great.
[00:19] My fourth one in a uh fourth one in a
[00:21] row and I've got to tell you this is
[00:22] we're doing a great work as Bitcoiners.
[00:24] You guys are doing amazing work at
[00:25] Bitcoin Magazine. So kudos. Thank you. I
[00:27] mean it's incredible. Um, there's 40,000
[00:30] 30,000 people here. How do how does what
[00:32] does the energy feel like now? You've
[00:33] been around for a little bit. What What
[00:35] is it like to see this scale that we've
[00:37] reached? Well, you know, I I was I
[00:39] brought it up earlier and I'm I'm kind
[00:41] of guilty of it is there's a lot more
[00:43] sport coats out there today if you
[00:44] notice. Feels a little bit more like a
[00:46] traditional banking uh expo with a lot
[00:48] of like some crypto and some and other
[00:50] things sprinkled in. Uh but the overall
[00:52] energy and enthusiasm and the just the
[00:54] scale of it from just from last year in
[00:56] Nashville. Nashville was uh you had a
[00:58] lot of folks there just because Trump
[00:59] was there, right? That was there was a
[01:00] lot of folks and here at this uh it
[01:02] really hits home. I was I watched that
[01:04] line with JD Vance this morning was
[01:06] wrapped around the expo all the way to
[01:07] the casino floor. Uh what a great time
[01:09] to be in Bitcoin and be alive in
[01:11] Bitcoin. Yeah, I mean I'm hanging on to
[01:13] the business casual, but uh definitely
[01:15] the bigers are going pro, you know, and
[01:17] and I think there's a a lot of upside to
[01:20] to going pro, especially when you have,
[01:22] let's say, a friendly administration,
[01:24] things are starting to the the the
[01:26] country starting to understand Bitcoin.
[01:28] Um so maybe tell us a little bit about
[01:30] the Bitcoin IRA side of things. Um what
[01:33] are what are you guys doing and uh what
[01:36] topics do you think the public still
[01:37] doesn't quite understand about this
[01:38] product that you guys have? Absolutely.
[01:39] So, we've uh we're not new. We've been
[01:41] I'm a little OG. That's why I've got
[01:42] some gray hairs. I've been through a few
[01:44] cycles, few bears. Uh we started uh
[01:46] building it in 2015. Uh so just about a
[01:49] decade. We just celebrated. Uh and the
[01:51] goal was to allow folks to use the tax
[01:54] advantage shelter of an IRA with
[01:57] cryptocurrency investing. What better
[01:58] place to have been able to snag up a
[02:00] bunch of Bitcoin at $500 a unit, which
[02:02] was some of our first clients back then
[02:04] in 2016 in a Roth IRA where you have
[02:07] taxfree growth and taxfree distribution.
[02:09] Uh, a lot of folks and Bitcoiners I know
[02:11] don't realize they actually have 25%
[02:13] less Bitcoin than they think they do
[02:15] because there'll be a day where we have
[02:16] to Annie up to Uncle Sam. And this is a
[02:18] great tool that America, the government
[02:20] gives us, which they barely ever give us
[02:22] very many tools uh to save uh and grow
[02:24] taxfree, which means you can trade and
[02:26] swap. We have about 75 different
[02:27] cryptocurrencies without having to worry
[02:29] about short-term or long-term capital
[02:31] gains implications. Uh, and we started
[02:32] small. Why were Bitcoin IRA was the only
[02:34] one around back then? none of the alts
[02:36] had existed yet and slowly built up to
[02:39] Ethereum, XRP and now up to about 75 80
[02:42] coins and uh we're thrilled. You know,
[02:43] we've got over 200,000 investors now
[02:45] across a decade about 14 billion that's
[02:47] with a B of assets under custody. Uh so
[02:50] that's impressive. You got meme coins.
[02:52] Uh yeah, we got some of those. We I just
[02:54] actually put some Pepe in my account
[02:55] last week. Uh really, you know, it's you
[02:58] never know which one of those soft spot
[02:59] for Pepe. Yeah. Who doesn't? Isn't he so
[03:01] adorable? He's great. Uh Pepe is great.
[03:03] We were one of the first to put Sheibba
[03:04] in back in the day, too. Um, and we've
[03:06] got, you know, there's we a a series of
[03:09] meme coins. You've also got the layer
[03:11] twos. Right now, probably after Bitcoin
[03:13] and Ethereum, the most popular coin this
[03:15] year so far has been Salana for sure.
[03:16] So, you're telling the public, you're
[03:18] telling people that they can play
[03:19] memecoins without cap gains tax with a
[03:22] that's especially when they moon, right?
[03:27] Uh, but no, that I think that's that's
[03:28] cool and and it's interesting as a
[03:31] long-term investment strategy, right? So
[03:32] you can what are the sort of terms? You
[03:35] can't just sort of go in take the trade
[03:36] and get out, right? It's you're sort of
[03:38] Yeah, it's it's a longer term mentality,
[03:40] which I think most Bitcoiners do have
[03:41] that we're not in this for a quick rip
[03:44] it and run mentality. Now, there may be
[03:46] some coins that you go into for a short
[03:47] period and then you go back to a lot of
[03:49] guys will trade alts just to stack more
[03:51] Bitcoin with their winnings, right? Uh
[03:53] but no, obviously it's just like any
[03:55] other IRA. So, you've got uh traditional
[03:57] IAS, Roth IAS, SE IAS, simple IAS. Any
[04:01] of those you can open up the account,
[04:03] and then there's three ways that you
[04:04] fund the account. First is common
[04:06] contribution every year. Uh we're both
[04:08] under 50, so we can do $7,500 every tax
[04:10] year that we can put in. If you put it
[04:12] in with a Roth, you get no benefit for
[04:14] your taxes for the year, but you get
[04:15] taxfree distribution. If you put it in
[04:18] for traditional, you actually get to
[04:19] lower your tax bill for the year, which
[04:20] is a nice little added perk, and you get
[04:22] that growth tax deferred over time. Uh
[04:24] Seps and Simple is the same. Actually,
[04:25] SEPs are really popular for crypto folks
[04:28] because most of us are also small
[04:29] business owners and you can put a larger
[04:31] contribution in. Uh, and then a lot of
[04:33] folks have old 401ks from past jobs,
[04:35] maybe uh before they got into crypto or
[04:38] before they diamond hands came out, they
[04:40] were they were working somewhere and
[04:41] they and they have an old 401k. I come I
[04:44] like to always say that's silly to leave
[04:45] it at your old employer. That's kind of
[04:46] like your favorite hoodie leaving it at
[04:48] your ex-girlfriend's house. It just
[04:50] doesn't make sense to me, right? Um,
[04:53] okay. And how does the the custody side
[04:55] of it work? I know there's like there
[04:57] are different ways to do it. Yeah. So,
[04:59] absolutely. When we first started this
[05:01] there and I still believe there's I do
[05:03] self-custody outside of my retirement
[05:04] plan, but one of the terms and
[05:06] conditions of the IRA or the IRS is you
[05:08] can't have actual custody of your
[05:10] holdings. So, if you had stocks, real
[05:12] estate, gold bars, or coins in your IRA,
[05:14] you wouldn't be able to have direct
[05:16] custody, self- custody of it. So we
[05:18] partnered back in 10 years ago with our
[05:20] friends Belshi and the boys at Bitco and
[05:21] built the first multi- signature wallet
[05:23] designed for custody solutions. So the
[05:26] assets will sit in segregated insured
[05:27] wallets under your IRA and then the
[05:30] middleware sits on top so that you can
[05:31] access and trade. But we're very very
[05:34] serious about about security. We
[05:36] actually build what we call the pentagon
[05:37] of custody. These layers, you know, the
[05:39] pentagon's got the five rings of it. And
[05:41] each of those layers are layers to
[05:42] protect your nest egg of Bitcoin. So you
[05:44] can't it's not like a hot exchange where
[05:46] you can just log into Coinbase and
[05:48] somebody could you get SIM swapped and
[05:49] somebody could just empty you out,
[05:50] right? Uh it takes uh AI AI identity the
[05:54] that's a tough one to say AI identity
[05:56] their verification some authorized tools
[05:58] and other things and you'll actually be
[06:00] on a call with somebody personto person.
[06:01] Uh we we one of our biggest I think um
[06:05] selling points as us as real crypto real
[06:07] people. So instead of just robots and
[06:09] chat bots and those things, you can
[06:10] literally call our number uh 8 and I
[06:13] memorized it from all the interviews I
[06:14] do. 877-9367175
[06:17] and you'll talk in about 90 seconds to a
[06:19] real person that's helped thousands of
[06:21] people open and fund their retirements
[06:23] in crypto. Yeah, I mean that's huge. I
[06:25] think um you know having good quality
[06:27] customer service in the age of robots is
[06:29] going to be it might become like a
[06:30] boutique thing. You know, we still use
[06:32] the AI though because we call all
[06:34] 200,000 of our clients. We call you on
[06:36] your birthday and give you a birthday
[06:37] gift and we call you on the anniversary
[06:38] of your account to to thank you for your
[06:40] loyalty. And we've we've taught some
[06:42] robots how to do those calls because
[06:43] that's that's about 400,000 calls a
[06:45] year, which is hard to do with humans. I
[06:47] used to do customer service report and
[06:48] yeah, it's a it's a wild industry uh to
[06:51] work in. But so yesterday was investor
[06:53] day. There was a lot of policy talk. We
[06:55] had um you know the Trumps one of the
[06:57] Trumps was here um
[07:00] the crypto AIR right like there was a
[07:03] lot of policy discussion
[07:05] is there anything on that front that you
[07:07] guys are paying very close attention to
[07:09] or that would make your life easier as a
[07:12] company while keeping like quality
[07:13] because I think I think one of the
[07:15] conversations that's sort of happening
[07:16] now is that a lot of the regulations
[07:19] well some of the regulations are kind of
[07:22] out of date with the digital age you
[07:24] know I mean we're seeing seeing the
[07:25] Coinbase hack. We're seeing all these
[07:26] sort of American C uh information
[07:30] entering hitting the the dark web and
[07:33] and it's sort of it's kind of a big
[07:35] problem that's caused by outdated
[07:37] regulations. But that's that's what
[07:39] catches my interest. But yeah, what are
[07:41] you guys looking at? Well, I definitely
[07:43] I think privacy protection of people's
[07:46] information is huge. That's that's
[07:47] something we've been years and years
[07:49] behind on for quite some time. We can
[07:51] never keep up with the newest technology
[07:52] and the newest threat. Uh for me
[07:54] yesterday VC said some very interesting
[07:56] things about uh financial literacy that
[07:57] really hit home for me. It's a big
[07:59] passion of mine. I think one of the
[08:01] things especially here in the United
[08:02] States that we lack is thorough
[08:04] financial literacy. Not just for adults
[08:06] us but also kids the understanding the
[08:09] power. I mean I came out of elementary
[08:10] school and we had this thing called a
[08:12] marit town in Denver, Colorado and we it
[08:14] was what we ran a little city for um for
[08:17] a week or for a few days and I really
[08:18] all I learned how to do was to write a
[08:20] check and checks are obsolete now. So
[08:22] there was no there's no education on uh
[08:25] what's compound interest, how do taxes
[08:27] work, what is a Roth IRA, these things
[08:29] really that that's all missing from just
[08:31] basic education standards. Even at
[08:32] higher levels, I went to the University
[08:33] of Colorado Boulder in my business
[08:35] schools. We never dived into a lot of
[08:36] that stuff. It was just you had to
[08:38] figure it out along the way. And I think
[08:39] that if we can empower our entire nation
[08:43] with more financial literacy, it's going
[08:44] to be really powerful. And it goes to
[08:46] the kids, too. you can bring kids in
[08:47] early. My daughter's 11 and I always try
[08:50] to go to her school at least once a year
[08:52] and do some education about Bitcoin. So,
[08:54] like when she was in TK, I put four kids
[08:56] together uh at a little shop, little
[08:58] FisherPrice store, and one of them was a
[09:00] caveman and another one I dressed up as
[09:02] a Roman soldier. One was dressed like
[09:04] you looking good like you and then
[09:05] another one in an astronaut uniform. And
[09:08] I gave each of them the means to buy
[09:10] something at the store. So, the caveman
[09:12] brought a rock and a rubber chicken. Uh
[09:14] this the Roman brought a um silver coin,
[09:17] gave 20 bucks to the kid that was
[09:18] dressed like you, which by the way, he
[09:19] never gave me the 20 bucks back. I hope
[09:20] he bought some Bitcoin with it, and then
[09:22] the astronaut had Bitcoin so that they
[09:24] can understand that evolution of money.
[09:25] I think it's I think that's a with this
[09:27] administration and with the focus on
[09:29] literacy and financial literacy and
[09:30] Bitcoin as a part of that uh is going to
[09:32] be really powerful not just for our us
[09:34] as a business, this whole community, but
[09:36] for the country overall. I mean that I
[09:38] I'm hoping to go to the keynote about uh
[09:40] superpower of Bitcoin should be the
[09:41] United States. I think that's a
[09:43] statement that we should it's going to
[09:44] take a lot of work but we should be able
[09:45] to do it. Well, we got like a couple
[09:47] minutes left. Is there any last question
[09:49] I should have asked you or any message
[09:51] that you want to get out there before we
[09:52] go? Um, well, no. I mean, you have
[09:54] everybody has the ability to put aside
[09:56] $7,500 $8,000. The government gives us
[09:58] this ability to do it. You get benefited
[10:00] for it. You get to grow taxree. Uh, take
[10:03] the opportunity, explore it, talk to one
[10:05] of our folks. We love educating people.
[10:07] It's one of our most our favorite things
[10:09] to do is when the phone rings and we get
[10:10] to talk with you folks. Uh and make sure
[10:12] you use the tool. I mean, if you're
[10:14] going to put $7,500 into Bitcoin this
[10:16] year, use that tool so that when it's at
[10:18] 75,000 or 750,000, you've got it tax
[10:21] free and tax deferred. Yeah. I mean,
[10:23] it's a very interesting option and it's
[10:24] makes a lot of sense to structure it.
[10:26] So, um yeah. Well, thank you. Great to
[10:29] meet you. Um you know, it's funny. I've
[10:32] I've never written a check and I've
[10:34] never owned a stock, you know. Wow. Wow.
[10:36] So there's there's a whole generation of
[10:38] people that are like basically
[10:40] cryptonative, bitcoin native and uh I
[10:43] think I think we're going to see we you
[10:45] know I hope that we will see a
[10:47] modernization of a lot of the
[10:48] infrastructure but but with this kind of
[10:50] protections that make a lot of sense
[10:51] because the idea that every time you you
[10:52] you buy you know whatever a bit key with
[10:56] Bitcoin you tax taxable event like
[10:58] that's not that's not how it should go.
[11:00] Yep. If you're if you're doing, you
[11:01] know, trading in, you know, in an
[11:03] organized way, I think that that
[11:05] actually makes a lot of sense.
[11:06] Absolutely. Awesome. Well, thank you
[11:09] everybody and uh stay tuned for more
[11:13] content from the Bitcoin Magazine Vegas
[11:17] uh conference. All right. Thanks, Juan.
[11:20] Yeah.
