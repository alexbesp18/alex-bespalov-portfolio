[00:00] This is kind of a sort of low-grade part
[00:03] of a World War III that's unfolding. One
[00:05] of the sort of most consistent themes of
[00:07] this podcast is moving from the old
[00:10] world, the post World War II era to the
[00:12] new world. And this is clearly part of
[00:13] that story. And just like Bitcoin is a
[00:15] big part of that story, just like AI is
[00:17] a big part of that story, systems of AI
[00:19] systems are orchestrating battlefield
[00:21] activities. um from this tactical to the
[00:24] operational to the strategic. Large
[00:25] portions of the kill chain, the fine fix
[00:28] finish, you know, sequence is automated.
[00:30] Palanteer has their own system they've
[00:32] been fielding for Ukraine. It's called
[00:33] the meta constellation and it's a sensor
[00:35] fusion platform for battlefield
[00:37] awareness as well as um sort of AI
[00:39] supported strikes. All right. Uh welcome
[00:42] back to the Bitcoin Policy Hour, a
[00:44] weekly podcast hosted by the Bitcoin
[00:46] Policy Institute. I'm your host, Zach
[00:48] Cohen, an associate with BPI, and I'm
[00:49] joined each week by my colleagues,
[00:51] Matthew Pines, BPI's executive director,
[00:54] uh, and Zach Shapiro, BPI's head of
[00:56] policy. Uh, we're now just a little over
[00:59] a week out from the Bitcoin Policy
[01:02] Summit. Uh, tickets are quite limited at
[01:04] this point. Uh, and we are getting very
[01:06] close to selling out. Uh, so if you do
[01:08] still want to come, you can grab your
[01:09] ticket by visiting btcpolicysummit.org.
[01:13] Uh, and we do still have a code for
[01:14] listeners of this podcast, which is BTC
[01:17] policy hour 21.
[01:19] All right. Uh, it's it's been a little
[01:22] bit since we since we came out,
[01:23] everybody here and and a lot has has
[01:25] transpired since then. Um, I think the
[01:28] biggest being uh the the conflict that's
[01:30] broken out in the Middle East between
[01:32] Israel and Iran. Um, you know, I think
[01:35] there's a lot to dig into here both on
[01:36] the broader politics side and, you know,
[01:39] Bitcoin in in wartime. uh as we're kind
[01:42] of coining here. Um so gonna go to pines
[01:46] here first. What what's going on in the
[01:48] Middle East? Maybe just give us a kind
[01:50] of a short breakdown of of what we're
[01:52] seeing or as short as as possible. Um
[01:55] you know to get the full lays of land
[01:56] here and then then we can kind of dig
[01:58] into the details.
[02:00] Yes. Obviously we could spend this
[02:01] entire hour just giving the exesus on
[02:03] the history of Middle Eastern conflicts.
[02:05] I'm not sure that's going to be the most
[02:07] edifying for the audience though. Um,
[02:09] I'll say that my perspective in in
[02:12] evaluating events like we see when, you
[02:15] know, conflicts all of a sudden, you
[02:16] know, lurch into our feeds and we see
[02:18] missiles flying and it becomes this uh
[02:21] subject of obsession, right? Which is
[02:23] always, is it World War II? Is it going
[02:26] to, you know, lead to some, you know,
[02:28] catastrophic tail event? And it usually
[02:31] never does, right? But that doesn't mean
[02:34] that it's not serious and that it's not
[02:36] a major data point on on a structural
[02:37] trend line. And I think from the
[02:40] perspective of somebody interested in,
[02:42] you know, policy over the long term and
[02:45] emergence of a novel monetary asset like
[02:47] Bitcoin that's, you know, entering into
[02:49] its geopolitical era, it is uh important
[02:52] to pay attention to the geopolitical
[02:54] shifts and uh you know changing risks
[02:58] associated with that. So that's kind of
[02:59] like the preface here, right? Um the
[03:02] second kind of zooming in a little bit
[03:04] further is uh like where this particular
[03:06] conflict sits in the global frame uh
[03:10] which is essentially to my mind defined
[03:12] by a
[03:14] uh conflict between rising Eurasian
[03:17] powers that want to sort of uh rewrite
[03:19] the rules of the global order that have
[03:21] been set by what I would call like
[03:23] liberal ocean uh that has dominated kind
[03:26] of the post you know World War II system
[03:28] and so China is the main pole in at
[03:31] Eurasian kind of uh ravanchious block
[03:34] but it kind of spans the Eurasian
[03:36] periphery and that's you see these
[03:37] conflicts across the Eurasian periphery.
[03:40] Um, some are more overt, right, like
[03:41] Russia, Ukraine, now Israel, Iran. Some
[03:45] are uh kind of in stasis like North
[03:47] Korea. Uh, some are latent or speculated
[03:50] about like Taiwan. Some are a little bit
[03:53] more marginal like like like India,
[03:55] Pakistan. Some are very like uh under
[03:57] the table or literally under the sea,
[03:59] right? Cable cuts, uh cyber attacks,
[04:02] assassination, sabotage campaigns as
[04:04] well as uh you know conflicts in space.
[04:06] So there's a global conflict playing out
[04:09] um between systems of power to set the
[04:12] rules for the 21st century and Iran uh
[04:15] Israel is I think just a regional
[04:16] version of this local conflict that has
[04:18] its own of this global conflict that has
[04:19] its own local character. And so then
[04:22] zooming in further right where we are
[04:23] now although this changes by the hour um
[04:27] is I think where along this ratchet of
[04:29] escalation we see the United States
[04:32] calibrating its approach. Right? Israel
[04:34] started this uh you know most recent set
[04:37] of of of strikes that have you know at
[04:40] least to I think most objective
[04:42] observers gone uh extremely successfully
[04:45] from Israel's perspective. They've wiped
[04:46] out I think all the nuclear scientists
[04:48] they've targeted. They've wiped out like
[04:49] a large percentage maybe 30 to 40% of uh
[04:53] Iran's uh you know ballistic missile
[04:55] launchers. They've effectively
[04:57] established air supremacy. They've
[04:59] targeted wide swaths of the military and
[05:00] command leadership. They've credibly
[05:02] threatened potentially now to target the
[05:04] political leadership and essentially
[05:06] they're flexing a lot of strategic
[05:07] dominance from the strategic surprise of
[05:09] their lightning bolt strikes uh the last
[05:11] few days. And now the most you know
[05:14] important dynamic is what does the
[05:15] United States do? Uh United States has
[05:17] surged uh assets into the region,
[05:19] tankers uh uh moving carriers and
[05:23] bombers into the region and President
[05:26] Trump is you know articulating his his
[05:29] uh his feelings almost in real time. uh
[05:31] on the subject. Um and he's made it very
[05:34] clear that he wants unconditional
[05:35] surrender, that he can if he wanted to
[05:37] strike and kill the the national leader
[05:40] of Iran, Kmeni, at at any point. Uh and
[05:43] that uh he's made it very clear from his
[05:45] perspective that um a critical uh
[05:48] requirement of any, you know, ceasefire
[05:50] is the end of Iran's nuclear program.
[05:53] That the approximate trigger for this
[05:55] recent um set of strikes, at least
[05:57] apparently. Again, this is all just
[05:59] going through the the news. Hard to know
[06:00] what's true is that Iran was close to
[06:02] breakout. They had, you know, developed
[06:04] a nuclear trigger and that given their
[06:06] existing stocks of enriched uranium
[06:08] would put them within, you know, days or
[06:10] weeks of developing a functional nuclear
[06:12] device, which from is Israel's
[06:15] perspective is a you know, red line and
[06:18] it may now now be the US's red line. And
[06:21] uh so the last point on that is uh
[06:22] Israel can do only so much in terms of
[06:25] uh fully destroying uh Iran's nuclear
[06:28] program. You know, in particular for
[06:29] Fordo, a deeply buried site about 90
[06:31] meters under Iraq. Maybe if they had
[06:33] the, you know, air supremacy and
[06:35] multiple waves of strikes that were
[06:37] extremely precise and maybe some deep
[06:39] penetrators that we don't know about,
[06:41] maybe they could damage or destroy
[06:42] Fordo. But um at least in the open
[06:44] source that uh will require um you know
[06:47] mother of all bombs uh 30,000 lb deeply
[06:50] you know like deep penetrators from the
[06:52] from the US inventory. So the sort of
[06:55] first phase of this uh conflict seems to
[06:57] have been engineered by um Israel to set
[07:01] set it up so that um the argument will
[07:04] be convincing to Trump that Israel that
[07:06] that Iran is on their back foot. They
[07:08] have been uh they're close to being
[07:10] defanged. Israel has essentially opened
[07:12] the door and all the United States has
[07:13] to do is kind of like walk through it
[07:16] and can uh you know fundamentally reset
[07:18] the bargaining table uh in in the Middle
[07:20] East. Um and so that's why it could be
[07:22] at a you know an important geopolitical
[07:24] hinge moment here. Uh Iran has suffered
[07:27] a lot of strategic defeats um with the
[07:29] destruction of of of Hezbollah, the loss
[07:32] of their Syrian proxy and now
[07:34] effectively the defanging of a lot of
[07:35] the military nuclear and intelligence
[07:37] apparatus. And so, you know, Trump might
[07:41] be convinced that actually the the the
[07:43] the co the costs versus the benefit and
[07:47] the risk versus the reward now in favor
[07:49] of intervention and direct US strikes.
[07:52] That hasn't happened yet. He's
[07:54] threatening it. He's putting the
[07:54] capabilities in place to do it. By the
[07:56] time this airs, it might have already
[07:57] happened and this conversation will be
[07:59] moot. Um, but so this is happening in
[08:02] that in that context. Uh, obviously wars
[08:04] are nonlinear processes. It's hard to
[08:06] predict, you know, what happens or what
[08:08] the counter will be. Iran has lots of
[08:10] asymmetric options on the table to
[08:11] respond with terrorist attacks or uh
[08:14] moves that could be economically
[08:15] disruptive, right? Obviously, there's
[08:17] lots of conversation about straight from
[08:19] that particular scenario, right? China
[08:21] might be hurt more. They have 2 million
[08:22] barrels of oil a day that they export
[08:24] from Iran mostly and so any closure
[08:27] there might be, you know, more more
[08:30] painful for them. Although there's 20
[08:31] million barrels that go through that
[08:32] every day. Um, so that would hurt the
[08:35] global economy. Uh, and western bond
[08:39] markets are pretty fragile at the
[08:40] moment. So any, you know, things that
[08:42] could create an uplift in inflation
[08:43] expectations could be, uh, an additional
[08:46] problem for Scott Bessant. Um, but those
[08:48] are structural issues. I don't think
[08:50] those would be unmanageable. I don't
[08:51] think those would be the primary
[08:52] decision factors for Trump in the
[08:54] National, you know, in in the National
[08:56] Security Council meetings that he's
[08:58] having right now. Um so this is a zoom
[09:00] between strategic and tactical between
[09:02] um uh also political damage between
[09:05] camps in the Trump White House that are
[09:08] you know absolutely opposed to getting
[09:10] involved in another Middle Eastern war
[09:12] and that for both ideological reasons
[09:14] also for more pragmatic reasons. So
[09:15] folks that argue that actually this is a
[09:17] zero sum competition with force uh
[09:19] posture in Asia to challenge and counter
[09:22] China. Uh, and then there's other folks
[09:24] on the other side of the aisle that see
[09:25] this as a, you know, once in a
[09:27] generation opportunity to really reset
[09:28] the the the uh the geopolitical terms in
[09:31] the Middle East and take a longunning
[09:33] adversary off the board. Here we are.
[09:36] Um, so that's my that's my setup. Zach,
[09:38] I want to go to you. Obviously, I'm sure
[09:40] you have thoughts about this, but I
[09:41] think the other thing that that came up
[09:42] in our brief chat before this was um,
[09:45] you know, sort of the way that that
[09:47] Trump has been posturing through this uh
[09:49] whole conflict. Um, you know, I think
[09:52] one of the one of the major claims
[09:54] that's that I've seen a lot on Twitter
[09:56] is that, you know, Trump sort of
[09:57] campaigned on a, you know, anti-war,
[10:00] anti- um, you know, getting involved in
[10:03] an overseas conflict sort of foreign
[10:05] policy. Um, and I think a lot of people
[10:07] seem seem outraged at the fact that, you
[10:10] know, he's gotten involved in this and
[10:11] and been sort of um, very active, you
[10:15] might say. Um, so just curious on your
[10:17] thoughts on that. obviously, you know,
[10:18] other thoughts I'm sure you have as
[10:20] well, but um yeah. Yeah, for sure. I I
[10:23] think maybe the best way to uh approach
[10:26] the situation uh which is very familiar
[10:28] to Bitcoiners is is to look at
[10:30] everyone's individual incentives sort of
[10:32] as a map uh for what's going on or what
[10:34] might happen going forward. So, starting
[10:38] with the Israelis, um, Israel has felt
[10:41] that Iran has been a uh, existential
[10:44] threat to them for a long time and
[10:45] specifically the prospect of Iran
[10:46] getting a nuclear weapon. Um, the
[10:48] Israelis have dealt with this in other
[10:50] countries. I think they did a commando
[10:51] raid to uh, blow up a uh, uranium
[10:54] enrichment facility in Syria uh, back
[10:56] under the Assad regime. They did air
[10:58] strikes, I think it was in the late 80s
[11:00] or early 90s against a nuclear reactor
[11:02] in Iraq. and uh they view the talk from
[11:06] the sort of political leadership of Iran
[11:08] about wiping Israel off the map as uh
[11:11] meaning that is unacceptable um that
[11:13] Iran get nuclear weapons. Um the
[11:16] Israelis were really unhappy
[11:17] specifically with the Obama
[11:19] administration uh that entered into the
[11:21] Iran deal or the JCPOA um uh in the
[11:24] 2010s uh to the point where uh Netanyahu
[11:28] who's currently the still the the
[11:29] president of Israel came to the United
[11:30] States at the invitation of Republicans
[11:32] to talk uh to Congress over President
[11:35] Obama's head uh because he really did
[11:37] not want us to enter into that deal. and
[11:39] they, you know, viewed that as kicking
[11:41] the can down the road. Uh that, you
[11:43] know, they thought the Iranians were
[11:44] lying about their intentions. They said
[11:46] we were enriching uranium for power
[11:47] purposes, but really they were trying to
[11:49] make a bomb. Um recently, despite sort
[11:53] of trashing the JCPOA, uh Trump has said
[11:57] that he wanted to uh modernize
[12:00] essentially that same agreement and
[12:01] reach a a new nuclear deal with Iran. Um
[12:03] the Israelis again pretty unhappy about
[12:05] that. They don't trust Iran. They don't
[12:07] think, you know, they think it really is
[12:08] a uh sort of Holocaust level threat to
[12:11] them if if Iran gets a nuclear weapon
[12:13] and wants to wipe them off the the map.
[12:16] So, there were 60 days of discussion
[12:18] over a potential new Iran deal between
[12:21] uh the United States uh and Iran. This
[12:24] initial strike happened on the 61st day.
[12:26] Uh there's going to be a lot of stuff
[12:28] that will come out in the future about
[12:29] what to what extent uh the United States
[12:31] and the US intelligence knew about this
[12:33] attack. Um obviously they they knew that
[12:36] it was going to happen. Uh the the fact
[12:38] that it happened on the 61st day of this
[12:40] negotiation when Trump gave them 60 days
[12:42] to reach a deal is definitely not an
[12:43] accident. Um the United States clearly
[12:45] gave them some sort of green light. Um
[12:47] but initially said listen we're not
[12:49] we're not part of this. We didn't
[12:50] condone this. Um but you know this is
[12:53] this is what happened. And uh you know
[12:56] one thing that the Israelis clearly want
[12:58] is to actually now wipe out Iran's
[13:00] ability to make a bomb. And there there
[13:01] are two ways that can happen. One is
[13:04] comprehensive kinetic strikes against
[13:06] all of the different uh factories
[13:09] essentially that Iran uses for their
[13:10] nuclear process. Uh the biggest two
[13:12] being uh Natans, which is this partially
[13:15] above ground, partially below ground
[13:16] facility in the desert uh which was the
[13:19] subject of of maybe the most famous
[13:20] cyber attack of all time in 2014 that
[13:23] led to the stuckset virus that actually
[13:25] has an interesting Bitcoin connection.
[13:27] Some of that same uh code was used in
[13:29] the early sort of cryptojacking attacks
[13:32] and and Bitcoin ransomware attacks. Um
[13:34] that was a joint attack by the United
[13:35] States and Israel. Um and then this uh
[13:38] word that everyone's going to hear a
[13:39] lot, Fordo, this other enrichment and
[13:42] storage facility that's half a mile uh
[13:44] below ground in the mountains that Matt
[13:47] was referencing. uh Israel probably does
[13:49] not have the munitions to take out uh
[13:51] from the air and would be reliant on the
[13:54] United States if it's going to be an air
[13:56] attack. Otherwise, you know, Israel
[13:58] would have to probably go in with a with
[14:00] a ground attack, a commando attack
[14:01] similar to what they did in Syria. But
[14:04] to understand sort of Israel's
[14:06] motivations here, they are not going to
[14:08] stop this attack until um they feel like
[14:11] Iran's capabilities are wiped out. Uh
[14:13] which will either happen through their
[14:14] kinetic force or would happen with a
[14:16] deal brokered by the United States where
[14:19] uh the Iranians give up for and give up
[14:22] Natans and really sort of to some high
[14:26] degree of satisfaction actually destroy
[14:27] these capabilities. Um, and it's hard to
[14:31] see sort of a deal that happens short of
[14:33] that. Uh, and Israel would not have
[14:36] launched this attack. You know, they've
[14:38] been really flexing sort of their
[14:40] muscles here both in terms of
[14:41] intelligence. They apparently built a
[14:44] covert drone base right outside of Tran,
[14:47] right? The MSAD actually set up a
[14:49] factory to create drones that would go
[14:50] after anti-aircraft munitions and
[14:52] ballistic missiles. Um, they clearly
[14:54] just knew in granular detail where all
[14:56] of the Iranian military leadership, by
[14:59] the way, who I'm sure have pretty decent
[15:00] operational security because they know
[15:01] that they're targets. They knew where
[15:03] those people were hiding to the level of
[15:04] their bedroom and were able to, you
[15:06] know, be taken out by these really
[15:08] incredibly precise attacks that you can
[15:10] see pictures of uh on Twitter. And it's
[15:14] hard to believe that they entered this
[15:16] um knowing that, you know, they didn't
[15:18] have the capability to take out Foro.
[15:20] they, you know, knew they'd be reliant
[15:22] to the United States and they were
[15:23] gambling on whether the United States uh
[15:25] would get involved or not. So, I I
[15:27] really think the like three potential
[15:29] outcomes here are um the United States
[15:32] joins I don't think the United States is
[15:34] going to put boots on the ground. We'll
[15:34] talk about the United States in some in
[15:36] a second, but I don't think the United
[15:37] States is going to join with boots on
[15:38] the ground. It's either the United
[15:39] States joins an attack and takes out
[15:41] Forau, which I think is probably the
[15:43] most likely outcome, and then uh Trump
[15:46] tweets, listen, you know, we did this.
[15:48] we couldn't allow the Iranians to have
[15:50] nukes. This is I think what Trump has
[15:52] been tweeting about recently sort of
[15:53] leading setting the groundwork for this
[15:55] and the United States is not getting
[15:56] further involved and you know we sort of
[15:59] consider it mission accomplished in
[16:00] terms of degrading Iran's nuclear
[16:02] capabilities. Number two is the United
[16:04] States doesn't get involved and the
[16:05] Israelis find some other way to take out
[16:07] Fordo either with sort of lots of
[16:09] precision strikes with smaller bunker
[16:11] buster bombs that wouldn't take it out
[16:12] in one shot and maybe commandos
[16:15] uh or the third is some sort of broker
[16:17] deal where Iran gives up these
[16:19] facilities. I think that those are the
[16:21] three options basically at this point
[16:23] for how it ends given how far this
[16:25] action is and how uh Iran's defensive
[16:27] capabilities have already been so
[16:29] degraded. Um, part of the timing for why
[16:32] this happened now is there was a sort of
[16:34] a back and forth attack between Israel
[16:36] and Iran over sort of the October 7th
[16:39] stuff. Uh, I think it was last October
[16:41] and Israel's strike then from his air
[16:43] force was to take out Iran's uh
[16:46] defensive anti-air capabilities and
[16:49] Israel I think felt like they you know
[16:51] there there's all sorts of disputes
[16:53] about the timing of when Iran could
[16:54] create a bomb. But I think the real
[16:55] concern about Israel is at some point
[16:57] Iran was going to get those
[16:58] anti-aircraft capabilities back and this
[17:00] is the time where they could go in
[17:02] basically unimpeded and you know it's
[17:04] been such an asymmetric result so far in
[17:06] terms of the war. So you know to the
[17:08] extent that Israel is driving this
[17:10] they're going to have to take out uh you
[17:12] know Iran's nukes either either by air
[17:15] uh by land or or by deal. Um they may or
[17:19] may not want regime change. So now we
[17:21] get to sort of the United States and
[17:22] what's our interest in this? And I think
[17:24] there are two things pulling in opposite
[17:26] directions. One is what you were asking
[17:29] me about, which is, you know, the sort
[17:31] of isolationist tendencies of the, you
[17:33] know, at least certain factions of the
[17:35] the Trump campaign and and a lot of what
[17:36] Trump said. You know, I'm not going to
[17:38] drag the United States into new wars. I
[17:39] think he really does mean that. I think
[17:41] lots of stuff we've heard Trump say over
[17:43] the years suggests that he is just
[17:45] reflexively anti-war. He doesn't want to
[17:47] be seen as a as a wararmonger. Uh and
[17:49] and he really just hates civilian
[17:51] casualties and and war. Uh on the other
[17:54] hand um there is a sort of deep
[17:57] geopolitical strategic opportunity here
[17:59] to shape the Middle East and the
[18:01] dynamics of the Middle East in a way
[18:03] that Trump has also shown himself to be
[18:05] really interested in. Right? So think
[18:07] about the Abraham Accords. Think about
[18:09] what happened recently with all this,
[18:11] you know, AI deal making in the Middle
[18:13] East and the increasing uh alignment,
[18:16] strategic alignment between the United
[18:18] States and the Gulf States who all kind
[18:20] of hate Iran also. I mean there's a
[18:22] little bit of a complicated relationship
[18:24] between sort of the Saudis and the
[18:25] Amiradis on one side and Iran on the
[18:27] other. It's a historically very
[18:28] difficult relationship. It weirdly seems
[18:30] to have gotten a little bit better
[18:32] during the sort of Biden interregnum
[18:34] between the uh Trump two Trump
[18:37] administrations. uh but by and large
[18:39] these are opposing interests in the
[18:41] Middle East and um you know there is a
[18:45] sort of a sense that even within Iran
[18:48] there is Iran was a quite liberal
[18:50] country until the revolution in 79 and I
[18:54] think there's a sense that there's a lot
[18:55] of the population that essentially
[18:56] identifies as Persian more than they
[18:58] identify with the sort of more strongly
[19:01] authoritarian Islamist regime that's a
[19:03] combination of the sort of religious
[19:06] leaders the mullas but
[19:07] what seems to I think a lot of
[19:09] commentators under that like a military
[19:11] dictatorship by the IRGC that was that
[19:13] really holds more of the power whereas
[19:15] the Mullos are often more seen as
[19:17] symbolic leaders and so there's an
[19:20] opportunity to for regime change that I
[19:22] think other parts of the Trump
[19:24] administration might be really
[19:25] interested in not just for the sake of
[19:26] protecting Israel which I think they do
[19:28] care about but really more for just
[19:31] diminishing Iran's power in the Middle
[19:33] East uh being able to set up sort of a
[19:36] more peaceful more businessfriendly
[19:38] Middle East, more aligned with the
[19:39] United States, right? Israel is an ally
[19:41] of the United States and the Gulf States
[19:42] uh are an ally of the United States and
[19:44] this is seen as an important counter to
[19:46] China's power and China's sort of soft
[19:49] influence. Uh and maybe if you have you
[19:52] know if you degrade Iran's nuclear
[19:54] capabilities and their and you know
[19:56] danger from terrorism funded by Iran
[19:58] Middle East that's one step in the right
[20:00] direction towards that geopolitical
[20:01] alignment. if you have fullout regime
[20:03] change, right? If if the Ayatollah Kmeni
[20:05] is is killed uh and you have a different
[20:09] government uh in place, maybe a more
[20:12] liberal government, then that that could
[20:13] totally flip the board on its head and
[20:15] present lots of opportunities. Now, the
[20:17] downside in regime change for the United
[20:19] States uh is the 20 last 25 years of our
[20:22] history, right? We have a very bad
[20:25] recent track record of regime change.
[20:27] And you know, in places like Syria, and
[20:29] places like Iraq, we've seen when
[20:31] there's a power vacuum, uh it's not
[20:33] liberal democracy, uh that loves freedom
[20:35] that fills that. It's things like ISIS.
[20:38] It's things like anarchy, chaos, what we
[20:40] see in in Yemen. And so, uh to the
[20:42] extent that there's regime change, you
[20:44] need to be really careful about what
[20:45] comes next. I think those are two sort
[20:47] of tendencies pulling in the opposite
[20:49] direction in the United States. We
[20:51] really don't want to be in the project
[20:53] of nation building again. That went
[20:54] really bad for us in the past. people
[20:56] have a lot of recent scar tissue and
[20:58] that is why you know Trump is and people
[21:00] in Trump world are running on an
[21:02] anti-war platform. But on the other
[21:04] hand, uh I I sort of like the framing
[21:08] that Matt was suggesting before that
[21:09] like it's not that this is going to lead
[21:10] to World War II, but this is kind of a
[21:13] sort of low-grade part of a World War II
[21:16] that's unfolding. One of the sort of
[21:18] most consistent themes of this podcast
[21:20] is moving from the old world, the postw
[21:23] World War II era to the new world. And
[21:24] this is clearly part of that story and
[21:26] we don't know where it's going but it
[21:28] seems like political alignment in the
[21:29] Middle East is a big part of that story
[21:31] just like Bitcoin is a big part of that
[21:33] story just like AI is a big part of that
[21:34] story just like China and Taiwan is a
[21:36] big part of that story and the
[21:39] possibility of dramatically changing the
[21:42] sort of the the shape of the board uh by
[21:45] regime change I think is an interesting
[21:47] opportunity for the United States
[21:49] geopolitically and we're going to have
[21:51] to see how far that goes. All right.
[21:53] Right. It's a sort of a very high risk,
[21:54] very high reward potentially uh
[21:57] proposition and uh you know I think that
[22:00] explains a lot of the sort of politics
[22:01] on both sides in the decision-m from a
[22:03] US perspective. And then very briefly
[22:05] from like an Iran perspective
[22:07] um the Mull want to stay in power. Uh I
[22:10] think they feel very strongly that their
[22:13] ability to stay in power has to do a lot
[22:15] with their nuclear program and and the
[22:17] deterrent that that sets uh and their
[22:19] ability to project strength that way. I
[22:21] think they look at what happened to Omar
[22:23] Gaddafi in Libya where he gave up his
[22:26] nuclear program and then uh you know
[22:28] ended up dead later uh basically as a
[22:32] result of US foreign policy and
[22:34] intelligence efforts uh and they they
[22:36] don't want that outcome and and on the
[22:37] other hand you look at North Korea which
[22:39] is like clearly a sort of outofc control
[22:42] rogue state and yet there's very little
[22:44] western intervention uh precisely
[22:46] because they have nuclear weapons and so
[22:49] that is I think why you would the the
[22:51] Iranian political leadership very
[22:52] resistant to give up nuclear weapons.
[22:54] And so that's sort of the the tricky
[22:57] thing here and and why you see Trump
[22:58] tweeting like we know exactly where
[23:00] Kmeni is and we could take him out and
[23:03] like it's really like okay uh you know
[23:06] you might your administration might not
[23:08] survive if you give up nuclear weapons
[23:09] but you definitely won't survive if you
[23:10] do. And I think that's at least at the
[23:12] time we're recording this podcast the
[23:14] way the Trump administration is is
[23:16] posturing. Um it's also interesting it
[23:19] seems recently both Russia and China
[23:21] which have been supporters of Iran have
[23:22] been somewhat backing away. Uh I think
[23:25] they don't want to get into a direct
[23:27] conflict uh if the United States is
[23:29] involved where it's you know a Vietnam
[23:31] or Korea like sort of proxy war between
[23:33] great powers. Uh I I think everyone, you
[23:35] know, the United States, Russia, and
[23:37] China have maybe not in living memory,
[23:39] but in, you know, family history memory,
[23:42] uh reminders of what that looked like in
[23:44] the aftermath of World War II and and
[23:45] with those sort of cold war era proxy
[23:48] wars. Um so anyway, that's how I think
[23:50] all the sort of uh incentives stack up
[23:53] right now. Um and you know, we'll see
[23:55] what resolution that comes to. But if I
[23:58] had to guess, uh I I don't see a way
[24:00] that the Iranian nuclear program
[24:02] survives this. Um and I think the most
[24:05] likely outcome is a limited strike using
[24:09] uh US munitions against uh the
[24:11] facilities and then not broader US
[24:13] involvement in a in a war. And whether
[24:16] or not that results in regime change uh
[24:19] yet to be seen, but I don't think that
[24:21] we're going to take out Ki.
[24:24] Satoshi released Bitcoin. The world was
[24:27] forever changed. No one realized it.
[24:30] This is the once- ina century
[24:32] opportunity. And this is just the
[24:34] beginning. Bitcoin is like digital gold.
[24:37] So I view Bitcoin in line with the next
[24:39] evolution of humans engineering a better
[24:41] world. I think the story of the past few
[24:44] years is Bitcoin going from a niche
[24:47] interest into a respectable global macro
[24:50] asset. Bitcoin Policy Institute has
[24:53] become a thought leader.
[24:59] All right. I think the thread I want to
[25:01] pull on here, thank you for that very
[25:04] thorough breakdown there, um, is the the
[25:07] sort of technological component, right?
[25:09] We're seeing sort of more advanced uh,
[25:12] forms of intelligence and and military
[25:14] prowess uh, showing up. So, Pines, what
[25:18] do you think is maybe different about
[25:20] this conflict? Right. I think we we've
[25:22] seen maybe speed uh of of you know, this
[25:26] attack, whatever you want to call it, uh
[25:29] being maybe faster than than what we've
[25:30] seen in the past. Um do you make
[25:33] anything of that? Um you know, and and
[25:37] does this indicate sort of broader um
[25:40] you know, maybe warfare tactics that
[25:42] that maybe we'll see going forward?
[25:45] Yeah, I'll butcher the the Mandarin, but
[25:47] uh the Chinese PLA have a have a term uh
[25:52] Jang, I believe it means like
[25:54] intelligentized warfare. And this is a
[25:59] part of the doctrine they've been
[26:00] started to put together many years ago
[26:02] envisioning a future where you have uh
[26:05] essentially algorithmic strikes,
[26:07] algorithmic um orders of battle where uh
[26:10] you know systems of AI systems are
[26:13] orchestrating uh battlefield activities
[26:16] um from this tactical to the operational
[26:18] to the strategic and this is the way of
[26:20] war that's been been developing from you
[26:24] know the lab and from the doctrine and I
[26:26] think we've and seeing it develop uh in
[26:29] real conflicts, you know, in Ukraine and
[26:31] now in Israel. And I think a few of the
[26:33] lessons learned um you know, both on the
[26:36] technological side as well like the
[26:37] human right side also on the human right
[26:38] side first, right? So we've seen in
[26:41] Israel, I think they had two public
[26:43] programs, Lavender, there's another one
[26:45] I'm forgetting the name of. um
[26:47] essentially using AI to do target
[26:51] identification, target nomination,
[26:53] target you know characterization and
[26:56] then humans select you know approve and
[27:00] then target prosecution which is either
[27:02] done by drones or by you know manned
[27:05] manned platforms where there's still a
[27:06] human in the loop but where large
[27:09] portions of the kill chain the fine fix
[27:11] finish you know sequence is is is
[27:14] automated. Um, Palanteer has their own
[27:16] system they've been fielding for
[27:18] Ukraine. I think it's called the meta
[27:19] constellation and it's a sensor fusion
[27:21] platform for battlefield awareness as
[27:23] well as um sort of AI supported strikes
[27:26] uh where you can basically in a certain
[27:28] use case you know Russian artillery can
[27:30] be located from satellites or from
[27:32] overhead imagery from drones can be
[27:34] geoloccated that uh can be characterized
[27:37] in terms of you know sort of validated
[27:40] as a red force and then send you know
[27:43] validated targeting coordinates and and
[27:46] fire solutions to Ukrainian batteries.
[27:48] is to do counter strikes within like 3
[27:49] minutes or so and getting the kill rate
[27:52] to like 75%. So that's pretty uh
[27:54] revolutionary from a kind of a just like
[27:57] field uh kind of AI um in military
[28:01] affairs. It's like another revolutionary
[28:03] in military affairs. Uh and then you
[28:05] have the drone story itself, right? So,
[28:07] if I'm China, I'm taking a lot of very
[28:09] intense notes on both the Ukraine and
[28:11] and Israeli um conflicts here uh for
[28:15] Taiwan because it seems to be seems to
[28:17] demonstrate how the combination of sort
[28:20] of clandestine pre-operational
[28:21] deployment of of some agents, you know,
[28:23] like on the ground to construct uh
[28:27] covert, you know, drone imp placements
[28:29] essentially and targeting, you know,
[28:31] beacons uh at high value uh like, you
[28:34] know, locations. um can facilitate
[28:37] strategic surprise. Bull from the blue
[28:39] strikes that can you know paralyze
[28:42] command leadership, political leadership
[28:43] instill um a sense of panic in the uh
[28:49] society and the national um decision
[28:52] makers and you know in a Taiwan scenario
[28:54] kind of force uh like a fat compli
[28:58] um nations are able to you know
[29:00] effectively intervene
[29:02] and these are exactly the capabilities
[29:04] that China's been doubling down in um
[29:06] and they're they're a hallmark of the
[29:08] future of war which isn't you know
[29:10] aircraft carriers as much like aircraft
[29:12] carriers matter for striking things like
[29:15] Fordo right so like the second or third
[29:18] wave of a conflict right that isn't
[29:20] fully resolved like we're seeing like
[29:22] phases of conflict are always the
[29:24] initial opening salvos right whatever
[29:25] the whoever decides to start it wants to
[29:28] get as much leverage up front and wants
[29:29] to get as much of the adversar's
[29:32] capabilities wiped out uh we're not at
[29:34] the point that we've seen where Israel
[29:37] was able to truly
[29:38] reach a strategic victory from just the
[29:40] bull in the blue, right? But they got a
[29:42] lot further than I think everyone than
[29:44] anyone expected in terms of significant
[29:47] degradation of the command capacity in
[29:49] Iran and the and the suppression of air
[29:50] defenses etc. Just like I think everyone
[29:52] was very surprised that uh Ukraine
[29:54] through a special operation was able to
[29:55] get like a third of Russia's strategic
[29:58] bomber uh forces uh destroyed just using
[30:01] you know pretty lowcost drones um you
[30:03] know crashing into these extremely
[30:05] expensive Russian platforms uh
[30:07] throughout the country. Um so very
[30:10] lowcost asymmetric operations with
[30:12] strategic effects but where the
[30:14] strategic effects of that initial you
[30:16] know algorithmic you know sort of drone
[30:19] uh you know kind of special forces and
[30:22] intelligence operation isn't yet
[30:23] sufficient to like be the strategic game
[30:25] changer right you still need the
[30:27] conventional platforms to roll in right
[30:29] the F-16s and the aircraft carriers to
[30:32] like to to bring the geopolitical heavy
[30:35] constraint onto the national leaders to
[30:37] say we now have theap capacity to, you
[30:39] know, force your force your
[30:40] capitulation. Um, you know, if I'm
[30:43] China, I'm I'm I'm realizing maybe this
[30:45] is a proof of concept that I could do a
[30:48] bolt in the blue that's achieve
[30:49] strategic victory all at once, right?
[30:53] Where like the amphibious invasion isn't
[30:55] necessary, at least as a kinetic thing.
[30:57] It just becomes a mop-up operation
[30:59] because the political leadership is
[31:00] fully capitulated because they're all
[31:02] dead. um you know not to be too too too
[31:06] you know morbid about it but like this
[31:08] is the state of the rapid progression
[31:09] we're seeing in technology and it was it
[31:12] was hypo it was hypothetical it was
[31:14] notional it was fictional until you see
[31:15] it play out in real conflicts and the
[31:16] national leadership you know re-update
[31:19] their priors of what's possible and this
[31:21] curve is going to only accelerate um and
[31:24] it does I think bring up huge questions
[31:27] that have been talked about a lot in
[31:28] sort of the laws of armed conflict uh
[31:30] where you have lethal autonomous weapon
[31:32] systems
[31:33] And we talk a good game about, you know,
[31:35] wanting to have a human to the loop. But
[31:37] The Crucible of War, you know, you know,
[31:40] human rights and moral considerations
[31:42] usually get get tossed out the door
[31:44] first. Uh, and you just need to
[31:46] accomplish your objective as quickly as
[31:47] possible. So, uh, it's not great, uh, to
[31:50] see, you know, the the ratchet here, um,
[31:53] continue to accelerate, uh, because, you
[31:55] know, as we've seen in the lesson of
[31:57] history is that, you know, the
[31:58] breakthroughs that happen on the
[31:59] battlefield overseas are often the
[32:00] template that gets, um, adapted for
[32:03] domestic policing, right? And so,
[32:05] predictive, you know, uh, algorithmic
[32:07] strikes, uh, are, you know, one step
[32:09] away from predictive policing, right?
[32:11] And, you know, sort of AI policing. uh
[32:14] and and I think we we you know we as the
[32:17] national um you know beacon on the hill
[32:20] right for signing shitty of democracy uh
[32:22] that's also runs a global empire we've
[32:24] had this fraught historical relationship
[32:26] between how we you know um uh govern the
[32:29] garrison overseas versus how we you know
[32:32] facilitate participatory liberal
[32:34] democracy at home and I think we've had
[32:36] this trajectory since 911 of the
[32:39] garrison state coming you know the
[32:40] garrison uh governance overseas coming
[32:44] Um I think the ethos of Bitcoin, right,
[32:46] is kind of this how to how to preserve
[32:48] again a space of freedom uh for the new
[32:50] technology uh that's that's going to
[32:52] define you know the relationship between
[32:54] the state and u and society. Um so
[32:58] that's I guess a rambling riff on AI war
[33:00] and bitcoin. Um I I don't have like a a
[33:03] hard you know optimistic take on on
[33:06] these particular conflicts. Um the last
[33:09] thing I'll say maybe just shifting back
[33:11] to the geopolitical like we we live in
[33:14] an era of again it's not global war war
[33:16] but it's global conflict in the sense
[33:18] that everyone is sort of in conflict
[33:19] with each other right the great powers
[33:22] and you could have that escalate to a
[33:24] really bad scenario which would be like
[33:25] World War II right we've had examples of
[33:28] that in the past where local conflicts
[33:30] quickly become global conflicts like you
[33:32] know a poor duke archduke gets shot in
[33:34] the head by a Serbian and then we're off
[33:36] to the races. um we don't have as much
[33:38] of those like you know alliance systems
[33:41] balances of power to like pull everyone
[33:43] in but we have enough of them to have
[33:44] some bad scenarios
[33:46] but on the flip side what it means when
[33:48] you have global conflicts it means
[33:50] there's also global bargainings and
[33:52] global negotiations happening and so the
[33:55] USRussia negotiation over Ukraine is
[33:58] very much kind of affected by what
[34:00] happens with Israel Iran and the trade
[34:03] war with China is also very much
[34:05] affected by what happens in Ukraine in
[34:07] Iran. So, everyone in is at the high
[34:10] table of global politics is looking at
[34:11] their, you know, risk board and
[34:13] realizing where they have a weak hand,
[34:15] where they have a strong hand and are
[34:16] trying to find ways of making their weak
[34:18] hand stronger and their strong hand
[34:20] stronger, right? And so, from Trump's
[34:22] perspective, he's like a he's a smart
[34:23] guy, but he thinks in terms of like
[34:25] almost visceral what can I trade, you
[34:27] know, who how can I leverage the
[34:29] situation in the moment?
[34:31] You know, if I'm modeling him in maybe a
[34:33] more charitable fashion here, it's Putin
[34:36] didn't take my deal in Ukraine and I I
[34:38] want to end this conflict, but it's not
[34:40] he's not coming to the table. Uh it
[34:43] looks like Israel told me they could do
[34:45] a bull from the blue, but I needed to
[34:47] like see it. And looks like it's
[34:49] successful. So, if I can get, you know,
[34:51] a lot of leverage over the Iranian
[34:53] regime, I get maybe two birds of one
[34:55] stone. I get to wipe out the nuclear
[34:56] program and I get to have a bargaining
[34:59] chip, a lot of leverage now against my
[35:01] two main rivals, Russia and China. And
[35:03] maybe I can force them to come to a deal
[35:06] over over o over Ukraine. Then China's
[35:08] the big one, right? Where the trade war
[35:10] kind of reached a bit of a stasis point
[35:12] after we realize we're heading towards
[35:13] more mutual economic destruction. But
[35:16] it's not clear where who has the upper
[35:18] hand here. I think Trump and his team is
[35:20] realizing kind of in real time how much
[35:22] leverage China does have over us whether
[35:24] it's rare earths um the bond market uh
[35:27] the fact that they dominate global
[35:28] manufacturing and are climbing value
[35:30] chains and are pure competitors in a lot
[35:32] of strategic domains you know we don't
[35:34] have like a strong hand against China so
[35:37] you know if you're Putin if you're I
[35:38] mean if you're Trump you're like I wanna
[35:40] I want to win so I want to go after the
[35:41] weakest guy in the block here like
[35:43] Russia has like nuclear weapons and like
[35:46] has a lot of power China is like my peer
[35:48] North Korea already has nuclear weapons
[35:50] and we we saw what happened when he went
[35:52] through the fire and fury episode in
[35:53] 2017. We got pretty close like he likes
[35:55] to go to the brink, but that was the
[35:57] adversary that already had nukes that
[35:58] could reach DC. Iran is like among the
[36:01] four in this sort of Eurasian
[36:03] uh sort of authoritarian sort of rival
[36:06] um alignment uh is like the weakest of
[36:09] the bunch. And so if Trump's trying to
[36:11] figure out, okay, who can I pick off
[36:12] from this loose, you know, it's not
[36:14] really an axis, but this loose
[36:15] arrangement, Iran would be the one you'd
[36:17] want to go after, right? And then use
[36:19] that to get leverage over probably
[36:21] Russia first because Russia's the next
[36:22] weakest and maybe the one that maybe you
[36:25] could deal would deal with. Um, and use
[36:27] that to maybe in their strategic logic
[36:30] get to the table with China and have a
[36:31] better hand by the end of the year.
[36:32] Again, try not to ascribe too much
[36:34] master planning, master strategy to
[36:36] Trump, who's very much like a reactive
[36:37] decision maker in in here. Um but
[36:40] there's there's folks around him that I
[36:41] think think in strategic terms. Um thus
[36:44] far I haven't seen much like operational
[36:47] um effectiveness from executing from
[36:50] from a grand plan. Um, but you know, I
[36:53] think it's important always to to you
[36:56] know, you can look at the chaos and just
[36:57] see chaos and sometimes that's what it
[36:59] is. But it's also important to try to
[37:01] define like what's the you know, there
[37:03] are systems of government here that are
[37:05] that are competing with each other and
[37:06] there's bureaucracies that are writing
[37:08] memos and those memos are like not
[37:11] completely just right? Like
[37:13] they actually are informed by some sense
[37:14] of what their national interests are and
[37:16] where they have advantage, disadvantage.
[37:17] And so national leaders are the ones
[37:18] with the bully pulpit. That's what
[37:20] people interpret in terms of, you know,
[37:22] salience of what's driving the conflict.
[37:24] But, you know, Trump tweeting and then
[37:26] what's actually driving, you know,
[37:28] Sentcom to do something could be
[37:29] different things. Yeah. Yeah. I think
[37:32] the thing that that that commentary uh
[37:35] really brings up for me is is a
[37:36] conversation we had a couple weeks ago,
[37:37] which is also on the AI front. Um and so
[37:40] gonna go to Zach Shapiro here, but I
[37:41] want to dig into um you know sort of the
[37:45] means by which this AI race maybe speeds
[37:48] up um and and whether you know what
[37:50] we're seeing in the Middle East right
[37:52] now uh might might indicate that the AI
[37:54] 2027 sort of thesis is is in full tilt.
[37:58] Um you know I think that's one way to
[38:00] read it. uh but curious if if you think
[38:02] otherwise.
[38:04] So I I don't know how directly this
[38:07] conflict ties up to the AI 2027 thesis
[38:10] which I think is much more about like
[38:12] specifically what's happening in labs in
[38:14] Silicon Valley. Um I think I mean one
[38:17] thing we're definitely learning is what
[38:18] the future of war looks like. I'm
[38:20] reminded of there's a a famous poem from
[38:22] 1898 uh about I you know wars that the
[38:26] British Empire at the time was involved
[38:28] in in Africa about uh machine guns and
[38:31] they had the Maxim gun from you know had
[38:33] had just been invented and and the poem
[38:34] ends famously uh no matter what uh we
[38:37] have got the Maxim gun and they have not
[38:39] um and then of course you know less than
[38:42] a quarter century later in in World War
[38:44] I uh you have British soldiers being
[38:46] mowed down in the trenches by by Germans
[38:48] with similar weapons.
[38:50] Um and what we are seeing, you know, in
[38:53] Russia, Ukraine, in the Middle East
[38:56] right now, um I think really does inform
[38:59] what might happen in the sort of
[39:02] apotheiois of all of this, which is
[39:04] which is Taiwan, right? That is the sort
[39:06] of heart of geopolitical conflict
[39:08] probably of this century. And Taiwan is
[39:11] very consequential to AI, right? Because
[39:13] it's where chip manufacturers are. It
[39:15] really is about Chinese power. China's,
[39:17] you know, going to be a geopolitical foe
[39:19] to the United States in the AI arms
[39:21] race. And so, one connection between
[39:24] what's happening now in Iran and the AI
[39:26] race is um the fact honestly of of Isra
[39:32] being so successful with this bolt-on
[39:33] blue style attack where you're
[39:35] normalizing sort of assassination of
[39:37] political leaders of key figures to sort
[39:40] of shape what your adversar's response
[39:42] is going to be. Uh you use all sorts of
[39:44] incredible targeting technology. You
[39:46] have drone swarms that are sort of
[39:47] asymmetric attacks that are cheap to
[39:49] deploy and difficult and expensive to
[39:51] defend defend against and that sort of
[39:54] previous advanced weaponry, right? Like
[39:57] large battleships, uh sort of large
[39:59] munitions are not meant to face. Um, if
[40:02] that makes a sort of Chinese takeover of
[40:04] Taiwan more likely in the nearer future
[40:07] or makes China feel like a bigger threat
[40:09] to the United States, probably that tips
[40:11] us in the direction of when we're making
[40:13] an AI safety versus AI acceleration
[40:15] decision. That might tip us in the
[40:17] direction of AI acceleration. The other
[40:20] part of this is is sort of what I was
[40:22] alluding to before with the Gulf States.
[40:24] Um, that it seems uh we were very very
[40:27] interested in business deals uh in the
[40:29] Middle East. in the Middle East being a
[40:31] home for a lot of the energy and compute
[40:33] that's going to train cutting edge AI
[40:35] models. Uh, I think if Iran ends up
[40:38] being a less significant player, either
[40:40] because it just has diminished power or
[40:42] because of regime change, I think that
[40:44] strengthens that thesis. And to the
[40:47] extent that the United States is
[40:48] involved in that, I think the Middle
[40:50] East is is sort of a neutral
[40:53] or could be a neutralish player between
[40:55] the United States and Chinese spheres of
[40:57] influence and AI. And if we sort of take
[41:01] out the Iranians, and that's something
[41:02] that the Gulf States are happy about,
[41:05] that could strengthen ties between the
[41:06] United States and those countries,
[41:07] especially if it's followed up by
[41:08] something like the Abraham Accords,
[41:10] where you have a consolidation of sort
[41:12] of US aligned powers dominant in the
[41:15] Middle East, whereas Iran was closer to
[41:17] a a Chinese proxy than an American proxy
[41:20] in that region. Um, you know, I think
[41:23] that sort of impacts AI and and I guess
[41:26] also just um shifting the taboo against
[41:28] war. Um, right, that war is a legitimate
[41:31] means of of achieving some geopolitical
[41:33] objective even if if you know Israel's
[41:36] saying it's it's the objective is
[41:37] self-defense. Um, that probably ups the
[41:40] ante for for competition uh versus not.
[41:43] One one of the interesting thoughts I
[41:44] have is um given the way the role
[41:47] technology is playing in this war uh and
[41:50] I'd be curious on either of your
[41:52] thoughts on this. Does this undermine
[41:53] the like sovereign individual thesis
[41:55] that as technology goes more digital as
[41:59] you know assets become digital as
[42:01] geopolitical power becomes sort of more
[42:03] amorphous and and diffused in cyerspace
[42:06] that the returns on kinetic violence go
[42:08] down right at least major kinetic
[42:11] violence go down whereas maybe the
[42:13] sovereign says okay local violence might
[42:15] uptick but nation states will be less
[42:17] incentivized to go to war with each
[42:18] other. Um it seems like maybe the
[42:20] opposite is true that uh you know we
[42:23] learn from World War II and then the
[42:25] forever wars, proxy wars that followed
[42:27] it that you know polit like real nation
[42:30] state violence is is absolutely sort of
[42:32] value destructive as negative expected
[42:34] value uh and and not worth it. But if
[42:37] you can do it in a much much more
[42:38] targeted way like we just saw Israel do
[42:40] especially on the first night of the
[42:41] attacks does that sort of invalidate
[42:43] that thesis uh contrary to like sort of
[42:46] the sovereign individual narrative that
[42:47] Bitcoin owners believe in. I actually
[42:49] wrote an essay called the actual impact
[42:51] of Bitcoin on war maybe before I was
[42:54] maybe even a fellow at BPI was like 2022
[42:56] for Bitcoin magazine. So you can go look
[42:58] at it and it was it was uh me being
[43:00] irritated a bunch of Twitter spaces and
[43:02] Jason Lowry stuff about Bitcoin fixes
[43:05] war. Um because I was just like this
[43:07] isn't realistic. This isn't looking at
[43:09] like the actual systems of power and the
[43:12] technological growth curve that we're
[43:14] on. I was just basically applying Jeff
[43:15] Booth's thesis to technological
[43:17] deflation to the capabilities that US uh
[43:21] and other you know great powers are
[43:22] going to deploy. Right? It's going to be
[43:24] much cheaper to deploy much more
[43:26] effective uh you know weapons in the
[43:28] future. That's just the the the
[43:30] deflationary uh argument applied to um
[43:33] defense production.
[43:35] uh and that uh that that that is another
[43:37] curve that's that we're on in addition
[43:39] to say Bitcoin adoption curve um and uh
[43:42] it's it's uh it's going to lead to a
[43:45] have and have nots world right that
[43:47] we're seeing play out now where I think
[43:49] maybe one of the reasons why Iran was
[43:51] caught by surprise is because Iran
[43:52] doesn't have the same space-based AI uh
[43:55] compute infrastructure that Israel have
[43:57] uh they don't have the the automated um
[44:01] you know sort of kill chain that they've
[44:03] been able to operationalize
[44:05] They have some drones, but they're
[44:07] they're like they're the drones that
[44:09] were effective like 5 years ago, right?
[44:11] They're like the cheap relative to like
[44:13] give to the Houthies to harass Red Sea
[44:15] shipping. They're not the like really
[44:17] lowcost asymmetric um you know, things
[44:20] that pop out of a container, right, that
[44:22] the uh that that the Ukrainians just
[44:24] like shipped into Russia. And so now
[44:27] we're in this world where those
[44:29] capabilities though are going to
[44:30] diffuse, right? But to be able to
[44:32] effectively deploy them, you're gonna
[44:33] need to have this full stack, right?
[44:35] You're going to be able to um and that's
[44:36] why I think like to to adapt David Sax's
[44:39] metaphor of like um the reason why they
[44:40] undid the diffusion rule on the AI is
[44:42] because they wanted to have this sort of
[44:43] market share competition with China.
[44:45] They really they pointed to like I think
[44:47] it was Malaysia taking like 3,000 ascend
[44:49] chips for like some token, you know,
[44:51] government project as like a proof that
[44:53] um this was the race that that was on to
[44:55] like, you know, get the rest of the
[44:56] world kind of onto our stack, right? our
[44:59] compute AI stack which is also an energy
[45:01] stack right and so to the sovereign
[45:02] individual thesis is like I'm not sure
[45:05] if we've talked about this in this
[45:05] podcast but like my view is the the the
[45:08] countries that have the capabilities are
[45:09] pursuing their own full digital
[45:11] sovereign stack right they want to have
[45:13] their own sovereign energy capabilities
[45:15] on which they can lay the compute that's
[45:18] going to um uh drive the uh intelligence
[45:22] that's going to power the digital
[45:24] economy and the digital money right that
[45:26] our our future civilization is now
[45:29] moving into right both stable coins and
[45:31] digital digital assets like Bitcoin,
[45:33] right? Like this is the stack from the
[45:35] view of great powers that they want to
[45:36] have full, you know, sovereignty over
[45:39] and so big like aspiring countries like
[45:41] the Saudis and the Emiratis have the
[45:43] capital now to try to try to buy their
[45:46] own version of that stack, right? They
[45:48] have their own domestic energy
[45:49] production. Then they're doing these
[45:50] geopolitical deals to get the chips and
[45:52] then the the the license agreements to
[45:54] be able to take the frontier models and
[45:56] use those locally with their national
[45:57] data. And then they're also at you know
[45:59] exploring digital assets right at the
[46:01] same and at the same time these are like
[46:02] converging trends at at that level of of
[46:05] national sovereigns. there's an open
[46:07] question for like individuals like how
[46:09] much can individuals if it's good for
[46:10] the Amiratis it's good for me right so
[46:13] I'm really interested in products and
[46:15] policies that allow any anyone not just
[46:18] in the US to create like a miniature
[46:21] version of that type of sovereign future
[46:22] stack for themselves right like the the
[46:25] sci-fi future version of is like you
[46:26] have a fusion reactor in your basement
[46:29] powering you know a chip fab right that
[46:32] that is you know like sort of 3D prints
[46:34] the next generation that does local
[46:36] training on your own, you know,
[46:38] compartmentalized data, right?
[46:40] Generating new models that are, you
[46:42] know, agents that you can control to
[46:44] deploy into an economy of other
[46:46] interacting kind of, you know, self-s
[46:48] sovereign entities to, you know, acquire
[46:50] more Bitcoin, right? That would be like
[46:51] the sci-fi version of the full full full
[46:54] stack individual in like, you know, 50
[46:56] years, right? And and that's, I think, a
[46:59] vision of the future that's like we can
[47:00] kind of anchor on or a vision of the
[47:01] future where it's all like where it's
[47:03] like the Borg, right? These are globe
[47:05] spanning platforms, right? Corporate
[47:08] structures where they're arbitrageing
[47:10] political boundaries in order to take
[47:12] advantage of, you know, collective
[47:14] action problems and then are able to
[47:16] basically plug everyone in the planet
[47:17] into a hive mind AI that looks form
[47:20] fitted to everyone individually
[47:22] uh and feels like the greatest, you
[47:25] know, cognitive and productivity
[47:26] amplifier that we've ever had, but
[47:28] fundamentally is a happy face on the
[47:30] showgoth that is an that that is Sam
[47:32] Alman's board machine. Um, and we're all
[47:34] using Worldcoin instead of Bitcoin. So,
[47:36] you know, which way? Western man, right?
[47:38] Sort of a techno dystopia,
[47:40] authoritarianism,
[47:42] uh, CBDC's and Worldcoin or self-s
[47:44] sovereign Bitcoin compute, uh,
[47:47] decentralized AI, uh, where we have a
[47:49] participatory, you know, commons and we
[47:52] have uh, a sphere of freedom in a
[47:54] digital world, uh, that we can that we
[47:57] can anchor to.
[47:58] Yeah, I think an interesting thought
[48:00] that that occurred to me listening to
[48:01] what both of you thought um tying this
[48:04] back into the Bitcoin conversation is um
[48:07] you know during the Ukraine Russia sort
[48:10] of early days, right? Uh Matthew Franti,
[48:12] a BPI fellow did an analysis that
[48:15] basically tracked like when news started
[48:17] to circulate about uh the invasion and
[48:20] the sort of impact that that had on the
[48:22] price of Bitcoin. And and one thing, you
[48:24] know, I haven't really looked too
[48:25] closely. It doesn't seem like there's
[48:26] been any significant movement in the
[48:28] price of Bitcoin since since this moved.
[48:31] Um but like to what extent do um you
[48:35] know national or or international
[48:37] conflicts um begin to like enrich people
[48:40] who are holding Bitcoin, right? Like is
[48:43] there a world where um you know as
[48:45] opposed to maybe previous times in
[48:47] history where where war was enriching
[48:50] maybe for those closer to the money
[48:51] printer where war sort like sort of
[48:54] suddenly becomes a means to um you know
[48:57] increase the wealth of Bitcoiners and
[49:00] that holding Bitcoin is maybe like a
[49:02] sort of hedge uh both for nation states
[49:06] right we've seen that sort of narrative
[49:09] uh come through but also for individuals
[49:11] Um curious if if you all have thoughts
[49:13] on that. I think it's uh two ways that
[49:16] that could happen. One is where there is
[49:20] sort of risk of confiscation of non-
[49:22] Bitcoin assets. Um so I think we did see
[49:25] a different narrative about Bitcoin
[49:27] emerge from the 2022 uh US freezing of T
[49:31] bills in Russia. Um so if we were to see
[49:34] stuff like that come out of war that
[49:36] could strengthen the case for Bitcoin.
[49:38] also anything that undermined sort of
[49:40] faith in the fiat standard that we live
[49:44] in, right? Or the the US world reserve
[49:46] currency. Uh which I don't think is
[49:48] happening right now in Iran. I don't
[49:49] think that poses a meaningful risk. Um
[49:51] which is probably why we're not seeing
[49:52] the Bitcoin price moving. I do think
[49:54] there are other sort of Bitcoin tropes
[49:57] that might be undermined here that that
[49:59] are worth reconsidering. one is sort of
[50:03] this uh you know idea that we have to
[50:05] deal with all the time at BBI which is
[50:08] it's not worth interfacing with the
[50:09] government. Bitcoin is inevitable. I
[50:11] hold my Bitcoin in cold storage. Nothing
[50:12] can happen to me. Uh you know if you
[50:15] want to see what state power looks like
[50:16] I mean Israel is a much smaller state
[50:18] than the United States. But look what
[50:19] they were able to do to individuals,
[50:21] right? Like you you are not physically
[50:23] safe if the state turns against you. And
[50:25] so I I I hope some of that can help us
[50:28] dispense with the notion that like
[50:30] interfacing with the state and and
[50:32] worrying about you know what policy is
[50:34] and how it impacts us uh you know and
[50:36] worrying about the actual monopoly on
[50:38] violence that the state holds um is an
[50:41] important task because the state can
[50:43] reach out and touch you sort of no
[50:44] matter where you are um and in a very
[50:47] sort of personal targeted way. The other
[50:50] thing has been really interesting to me
[50:52] is that just the amount of clear sort of
[50:56] outright not just regular propaganda but
[50:58] like disinformation propaganda I've seen
[51:00] on Twitter about the conflict. One of
[51:02] the sort of very famous things that's
[51:04] going around is the supposed image that
[51:07] uh Iranian backed accounts are putting
[51:09] around of a F-35 fighter they say they
[51:11] down. And if you look at the size of it,
[51:13] it's you know people are compared to the
[51:15] size of a Imperial uh star cruiser from
[51:17] Star Wars, right? It's just like way out
[51:19] of whack. It's AI generated. There are
[51:21] tweets from Israeli aligned accounts
[51:23] that are saying the United States is
[51:25] already in the war, which is not true.
[51:27] There are accounts that come dead, which
[51:29] is not true. There are accounts of
[51:31] television and fire, which is not true.
[51:33] But there's just like social media is a
[51:35] battleground uh for this stuff. And you
[51:38] know, one thing about Bitcoiners is
[51:39] people really and people in general, I
[51:40] don't mean to just single out
[51:41] Bitcoiners, but people are very eager to
[51:43] believe something they see on social
[51:45] media that aligns with their priors. And
[51:48] you should just know there's a lot of
[51:49] stuff out there that no matter which
[51:50] side of this you're on ideologically
[51:52] will align with your priors and will be
[51:54] just complete complete right?
[51:56] Not not even close to the truth. And
[51:58] it's important to be, you know, a little
[52:00] bit careful and and sort of media
[52:02] literate and trust not verify with
[52:04] information that's out there because
[52:06] this is clearly part of the battlefield
[52:08] now is people's emotions and uh sort of
[52:11] narratives on on social media. Um and
[52:14] then cyber attacks uh uh I I think are
[52:16] you know this has probably already
[52:19] played a bigger role in this conflicting
[52:21] than than we know. We know that like
[52:23] Iran has launched cyber attacks against
[52:25] the United States. Israel famously also
[52:27] is sort of one of the leading powers
[52:29] when it comes to cyber and um this could
[52:32] be another interesting use case for
[52:34] Bitcoin as something that like is less
[52:36] prone to cyber attacks than other
[52:38] monetary infrastructure.
[52:40] Yeah, I was going to say there's
[52:42] Bitcoin's value which you know in a
[52:45] environment is like 20% like gold 80%
[52:48] like you know a risk on
[52:51] sort of techreated equity I think is how
[52:53] it trades right if you just look at the
[52:55] kind of the the correlations and so when
[52:58] you have geopolitical risk event you
[52:59] know algorithmic trading drives it you
[53:01] know people apply more of a discount
[53:04] factor to risk on assets so again it's
[53:06] like is bitcoin gold is it's like it's
[53:08] it's a distribution is it 1% % trading
[53:10] like gold or 80% trading like gold. I
[53:12] think we're seeing it now. It's probably
[53:14] 2080. So that's its value. That's like
[53:16] less of an interesting thing because I'm
[53:18] not if you're event trading Bitcoin from
[53:20] Iran headlines like you're cooked. Like
[53:23] I don't know like you're just fully
[53:25] degenerate. Like it's fine, but like
[53:26] don't pretend that you have like a macro
[53:28] take. Um, and then there's Bitcoin's
[53:31] value proposition, which, you know, just
[53:33] speaking amorally, is just as useful to
[53:36] the mullers trying to flee to Russia
[53:38] with some assets as it is for the
[53:39] millions of people that Trump told last
[53:41] night to like evacuate Tyrron, right?
[53:44] And I think Tran's a modern, you know,
[53:46] big city with millions of people, lots
[53:48] of professionals in there. and they woke
[53:49] up, you know, with a tweet from the
[53:52] president of United States who can
[53:53] control, you know, lots of bombs who
[53:56] basically said, "Get out of your city."
[53:57] Right? Now, was that a real threat,
[54:00] right? Was it just like a psychological
[54:01] operation? Right? I think maybe both.
[54:04] But like this is now this is the world
[54:06] we're living in. So lots more like, you
[54:08] know, the human rights foundation has a
[54:10] lot of work to talk about financial
[54:11] inclusion and folks that are in uh
[54:14] countries with dalian currencies or
[54:16] kleptocratic regimes. I think as we get
[54:18] to a more unstable world where you know
[54:20] anyone can be subject to these sorts of
[54:22] drone strikes right and maybe your city
[54:24] I'm not saying you know not talking to
[54:25] most Americans but like a lot of people
[54:27] around the world live in kind of
[54:28] semi-fragile states where these
[54:30] capabilities are going to be are going
[54:32] to empower you know potential um you
[54:34] know breakaway republics or you know
[54:36] coup factions and all of a sudden you
[54:38] can wake up one day and like your
[54:39] banking system is frozen right because
[54:41] there's a bit of coup. So like the the
[54:43] proliferation of these sort of
[54:44] asymmetric capabilities likely going to
[54:46] lead to more destabilized countries that
[54:48] aren't in the western world or aren't
[54:50] great powers. And so th those people
[54:52] like having an asset that you can just
[54:54] get out right easily without having
[54:56] bricks of gold in your backpack, right?
[54:58] That's easily it's like this will become
[54:59] more of a necessity, right? And not like
[55:02] a privilege of of you know speculative
[55:04] uh you know degenerates on on on on
[55:06] Bitcoin Twitter, right? And so I think
[55:09] that will become a thing that that won't
[55:10] move the price much because people don't
[55:12] have a lot a lot of capital but I think
[55:13] it will move the the the sp space of
[55:16] optionality for more humans. Uh that
[55:18] number is going to go up which I think
[55:19] is just as much as an important number
[55:21] to go up but it's hard to measure. Um
[55:23] and I bitcoin is very valuable right and
[55:25] its value proposition is is only getting
[55:27] more and more significant as as a result
[55:30] of these technological trends and the
[55:32] geopolitical instabilities um that are
[55:34] coming down the line.
[55:37] All right, we're we're nearing the hour
[55:38] here. Uh, but I would be remiss not to
[55:41] ask you, Pines, uh, in in eight days
[55:43] now, you're going to be on this stage,
[55:45] uh, with the deputy director of the CIA,
[55:47] Michael Ellis. Um, you know, does the
[55:51] conversation look any different now, I
[55:53] guess, is the question here. Uh, yeah, I
[55:56] mean, well, just stepping back, right?
[55:57] It's a remarkable turn of events for me,
[56:00] myself professionally, to be on a stage
[56:01] with the deput talking about Bitcoin,
[56:03] right? like and the fact that that's
[56:05] possible just you know exemplifies like
[56:08] the degree of change we're seeing in the
[56:10] world and how quickly Bitcoin has been
[56:12] normalized as a strategic thing and a
[56:14] topic of conversation inside DC I think
[56:16] it's been you know BPI's like whole
[56:18] raise on debt essentially from from the
[56:20] beginning is to get to kind of this
[56:21] point but now that we're at this point
[56:23] we also have have a commitment to the
[56:24] other thing we were talking about which
[56:25] is like Bitcoin's ethos and so I think
[56:28] we're going to have uh an excellent
[56:30] conversation with the deputy director of
[56:31] the CIA about how He thinks about these
[56:35] convergence of different disruptions,
[56:38] right? The emergence of digital assets
[56:40] as a strategic thing in the world
[56:41] system, the AI acceleration, technology
[56:45] competition with China, and overall
[56:46] geopolitical instability. And I really
[56:48] want to hear what he has to say. We
[56:49] haven't, you haven't talked before, so I
[56:51] will be learning in real time from
[56:52] everybody else. And then immediately
[56:54] after that, we're going to have Matt
[56:55] Carallo talk about the uh critical
[56:58] importance of the blockchain regulatory
[57:00] certainty act, right, and financial
[57:01] privacy uh and the insurance, you know,
[57:04] of of the use of non-custodial, you
[57:06] know, tools. Uh and then the afternoon
[57:08] we're going to have another session
[57:09] where we do backtoback uh first with
[57:11] Patrick Whit who's the director of the
[57:13] office of strategic capital uh at the
[57:15] Pentagon and he's uh Bo Hines is deputy
[57:18] on the president's working group on
[57:19] digital assets. So he's he's wearing two
[57:21] hats, one a very national security
[57:22] focused hat in capital markets, helping
[57:24] to advance US strategic interests and
[57:26] ensuring the US gets digital asset
[57:29] policy right right from a strategic
[57:30] perspective. And so he'll have a
[57:31] conversation with Ken Egan, our director
[57:33] of government affairs about that. And
[57:34] then immediately after that
[57:35] conversation, we're going to have the
[57:36] resistance money trio make the case uh
[57:39] for coin joints, right? And so I think
[57:42] like I don't know, I just think this is
[57:43] like what BPI is for. to like do the
[57:46] full barbell, the hard nose, you know,
[57:48] talk to the national security folks, the
[57:49] folks quote in the deep state who I
[57:52] think are more pro Bitcoin than you
[57:53] might suspect, right? And then not make
[57:56] any any uh compromises on our commitment
[57:58] to, you know, using the software the way
[58:01] it's meant to be used for the reasons it
[58:02] was created, right? And there is there
[58:05] is no either or. There's no trade-off.
[58:07] There's just push everything in those in
[58:08] those directions. Bitcoin just wins
[58:10] along every vector basically, right? Um
[58:13] that's the objective. And uh so I think
[58:15] it's g it's gonna be an awesome day. Um
[58:17] again like I think we're going to be
[58:18] close to capacity at this point which is
[58:20] just like mind-blowing since we we
[58:22] picked a massive venue this time. Um and
[58:24] Zach's going to give our our our like a
[58:26] really critical keynote kind of lay out
[58:28] this philosophical and sort of policy
[58:30] vision for BPI. It's going to touch
[58:32] touch on everything. Um I mean it's just
[58:35] every muscle is going to be tight. It's
[58:37] just going to be bam bam bam bam bam. I
[58:39] think people are going to be a bit
[58:40] overwhelmed. I think you're going to
[58:41] have to like, you know, consume this in
[58:43] like digestible chunks, but we're just
[58:44] going to give you like nine hours of
[58:46] just like extremely high signal content
[58:48] and just, you know, push push the ball
[58:50] down the field on Bitcoin policy in DC.
[58:53] Amazing. All right. I think uh for the
[58:55] folks listening at home, we we probably
[58:57] will uh be skipping next week's Bitcoin
[58:59] Policy Hour, but we will be live
[59:01] streaming uh the Bitcoin Policy Summit
[59:03] on the BPI uh handle on Twitter or X as
[59:08] well as YouTube and Rumble and I think
[59:09] Bitcoin Magazine will also be streaming
[59:11] it. So, uh be sure to tune in there uh
[59:14] to get your fill of of Bitcoin policy
[59:16] for the week. Um but and and I'll, you
[59:18] know, let Zach Zach So, how many times
[59:20] are you speaking and who are you
[59:21] speaking with? I think I'm speaking
[59:23] three times. Uh I'm doing the sort of
[59:25] index pages at the beginning, the table
[59:27] of contents, uh where I'm sort of laying
[59:29] out our uh broad policy view and what
[59:32] you you'll hear the rest of the day, uh
[59:34] and how to think about that. Um, I'm
[59:36] doing a fireside with Commissioner
[59:38] Pierce at the SEC to ask Bitcoin
[59:40] specific questions, which I'm really
[59:42] excited about because you almost never
[59:43] hear about that with Hester Pierce,
[59:45] who's known as as crypto mom, but every
[59:47] time she does interviews, people want to
[59:48] ask her about market structure and
[59:50] tokens and uh, stable coins and stuff
[59:53] like that. And and you know, hearing the
[59:55] SEC speak about Bitcoin is I think will
[59:57] be a rare treat. Uh and then uh I'm
[60:00] doing a policy panel with I think two of
[60:03] the sort of absolute best thinkers on
[60:05] protection of peer-to-p peer tools.
[60:07] Peter Van Vulcanberg from Coin Center,
[60:09] Mike Moser from Turos, but he's the
[60:11] former uh acting director of Fininsen.
[60:13] Um about okay, clearly we don't like
[60:16] what's happening with Tornado Cash and
[60:17] Samurai, but what does appropriate
[60:20] illicit finance law that understands
[60:21] peer-to-peer technology look like? Uh
[60:23] and I think that is a conversation that
[60:25] also all too rarely happens. So, I'm I'm
[60:27] really uh excited about the day. We're
[60:31] just like absolute like uh Bitcoin nerd
[60:34] policy wonk like Super Bowl. Yeah. It's
[60:37] almost inaccurate to say that we're not
[60:38] going to like this this is going to be a
[60:40] eight hour episode of the the policy
[60:42] hour pretty much. Like honestly, we
[60:44] would put this event on if nobody if
[60:46] nobody watched. Like we would just do it
[60:48] for ourselves.
[60:49] Yeah. Don't tell Grant. Don't tell
[60:52] Grant. All right. Uh that's a wrap and
[60:55] uh tune in next week for the uh for the
[60:57] Bitcoin policy summit and uh once that's
[60:59] over we can stop shilling it. So that
[61:02] will be a that will be a fun episode.
[61:04] Cool. Thanks guys and uh see everyone
[61:06] next week. Better.
