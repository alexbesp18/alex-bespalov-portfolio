[00:00] We're here live from the Bitcoin
[00:02] conference with the one and only
[00:06] maximalist Bitcoiner Max Kaiser. Max,
[00:10] how are you? How's the conference? How
[00:13] are the energies, the vibes? I'm
[00:15] enjoying this lovely onion bread right
[00:17] here and was just on a panel on the
[00:19] Nakamoto stage with the mayor of Panama
[00:22] City. And you know, we're taking
[00:24] everything we learned in El Salvador and
[00:26] we're moving it. We're teleporting it.
[00:28] We're exporting it to Panama, sitting in
[00:30] Panama. Now, you know, the region is
[00:32] going to be Bitcoin. We call it the
[00:34] access of Bitcoin. What have you learned
[00:36] from El Salvador that are you going to
[00:38] replicate Panama in all these countries
[00:41] to come? Yeah, good question. So, it's
[00:43] really two two-prong attack, which is of
[00:46] course you promote Bitcoin, but you also
[00:48] have to keep out the shitcoins, which is
[00:50] an very important part. uh of building a
[00:54] bitcoin culture and a bitcoin country.
[00:56] To that end in El Salvador after we got
[00:58] there, we created the Bitcoin office
[01:00] which is uh direct reports directly to
[01:02] the president. Uh we also created a law
[01:05] which states that only Bitcoin is money.
[01:07] Everything else is essentially an
[01:09] unregistered security. So all the
[01:11] shitcoiners would have to go through the
[01:12] registration process. And that keeps
[01:15] most of them out because they're not
[01:16] what they don't want to spend even any
[01:18] time whatsoever. They just want to start
[01:20] scamming people right away. So they have
[01:22] to they have to go through bureaucracy
[01:24] though they'd rather just move on to
[01:26] some other city somewhere else. So
[01:28] that's part of it. Then education is
[01:31] key. So we have education programs
[01:33] starting in the seven and eight year
[01:35] olds in El Salvador are learning about
[01:37] money. What is money? Uh and then
[01:40] Bitcoin. So all that can be wrapped up
[01:44] uh shrink wrapped you know and bring it
[01:46] over to Panama and then they adopt to
[01:48] the local scene and we have uh the the
[01:51] the revolution spreading uh to the
[01:54] region. Many would say like that the
[01:58] bottom up or top down the top down
[02:01] approach maybe like there are some
[02:03] people that say it's not as effective.
[02:05] What would you have to say to them?
[02:07] Well, there's definitely um the best
[02:11] scenario is a bottoms up top down
[02:14] approach happening simultaneously. Yeah.
[02:16] And the bottoms up approach is without
[02:18] doubt essential and without question uh
[02:22] Bitcoin has always been a bottoms up uh
[02:26] peasant revolution really. So what I
[02:28] like to think of it as and it was a
[02:31] frontr running institution. And you can
[02:34] only do that if you're starting at the
[02:35] bottom and working your way up. But to
[02:38] have also in addition to that a top down
[02:40] approach uh also helps. And so that was
[02:45] the challenge moving there was can you
[02:49] create a government partnership to
[02:53] create a Bitcoin country. And so that's
[02:56] been what we've been doing. The
[02:58] experience has been good and we feel
[03:00] like we can now showcase that and go to
[03:03] a coaching like Panama and have that
[03:07] kind of top and bottom approach. So I
[03:08] think they they complement each other.
[03:10] But if you only had to pick one or the
[03:11] other, you would go with a bottoms up
[03:13] approach because that's essentially what
[03:15] Bitcoin is all about from its inception
[03:18] really. It was a uh a movement from the
[03:21] very beginning. How does the these
[03:23] countries kind of like do they approach
[03:26] you and they're like, "Hey, we're we
[03:28] want to create, you know, the Bitcoin
[03:30] office. We're interested in investing in
[03:32] Bitcoin." How does that work? And
[03:34] normally you would say like from the
[03:36] outside government doesn't want to
[03:39] substitute their own currency. So how is
[03:42] like the story of you know reaching to
[03:45] Panama? Do they come to you? Do you
[03:46] reach out to them? Well, it's a game
[03:49] theory like you know working out on a
[03:51] sovereign level and you know game theory
[03:53] we saw it in the very beginning as it
[03:56] worked its way through to the developing
[03:58] the developer community in Bitcoin and
[04:00] in the early adopters and then in the um
[04:05] the the early movers and shakers the
[04:07] early investors and when it hits a
[04:10] certain level or strata in the stack of
[04:14] the economy and in society it'll trigger
[04:18] game theory. It'll trigger more people
[04:19] to want to mimic what's going on because
[04:22] they see something that they want to be
[04:24] involved with. And with Bitcoin, the
[04:27] ultimately the beauty of it is the
[04:29] beautifully incentivized structure of
[04:32] the components of the stack of
[04:34] technology which includes a social
[04:37] stack, a social component. And so when
[04:39] it gets to the nation state level, the
[04:42] game theory once again kicks in. So
[04:43] Panama looks at El Salvador and they see
[04:46] a country that's gone from the most
[04:48] dangerous country in the world to the
[04:49] safest country in the region that
[04:51] Bitcoin is a big part of what's
[04:53] happening in El Salvador. And so word of
[04:56] mouth, right, we heard about uh the
[04:58] mayor of Panama City was a big fan of
[05:02] President Blly and he was starting to
[05:06] embrace Bitcoin. You know, we hear that
[05:08] through diplomatic channels to be quite
[05:11] honest. So we offer to visit, you know,
[05:16] and then once we stick our nose under
[05:18] the tent, all hell breaks loose, right?
[05:21] Because we're like, you know, we're very
[05:23] good at orange filling people. So
[05:25] politicians have the need, for example,
[05:28] jobs, you know, that's one of the things
[05:29] they need to do. Jobs and security,
[05:31] those are two things they need,
[05:32] education. So when you pitch it on a
[05:35] government level, you try to hit those
[05:38] tick those boxes because you know that
[05:40] they at a minimum have to look at that
[05:42] themselves. After almost 15 years of
[05:46] arms telling people different types of
[05:49] groups and things, you know, you just
[05:50] have to kind of know who know your
[05:52] audience. But many of them like
[05:54] politicians, I feel like when I've
[05:56] talked to them, most of them fail to
[05:58] understand. They're like, "Oh, well, you
[06:00] can't physically hold Bitcoin." many
[06:03] still have that mentality. How do you
[06:06] get them to come around for like they'll
[06:07] say, "What on your last election
[06:09] campaign, what was your what was your
[06:12] campaign all about?" And they'll say,
[06:14] "Well, hope
[06:18] okay, show me the physical manifestation
[06:20] of hope. Can I hold hope? Where's hope?"
[06:24] It's like Bitcoin does the fact that you
[06:26] can't physically hold in your hand is
[06:29] not really a meaningful consideration
[06:31] when you're talking about what changes
[06:34] society. The beauty and the aesthetic
[06:37] inherent in the protocol appeals to our
[06:39] shared aesthetic in a way that motivates
[06:42] people to be better people than they
[06:45] thought they could ever be. And I know
[06:47] as a politician, you want your
[06:49] constituents to strive to be better
[06:52] people and to create a better community.
[06:54] Bitcoin is the ladder up to a higher
[06:58] state of consciousness in a much better
[07:01] society that you can help your people
[07:04] achieve. I've never met anybody that
[07:06] could in Orangeville. Really? That's
[07:08] true. Except for Peter Schiff. Yeah.
[07:12] Well, he just confessed he's a big
[07:13] winner at heart. you know, he says that
[07:16] he was responsible for creating more
[07:18] Bitcoiners than anybody else because
[07:20] they bought it in spite of the fact that
[07:23] he was talking about it. And I said, you
[07:26] know, that's like a prostitute saying
[07:28] that they're responsible for everybody
[07:31] in town getting a shot of penicellin.
[07:33] It's like, look, you you still have
[07:35] syphilis. It doesn't make you a hero.
[07:38] I know, Peter. He'll never stop. You
[07:40] know, the thing about Peter Schiff and
[07:41] myself is that we both started on Wall
[07:43] Street at about the same time at at the
[07:45] same firm, PH Leman Hutton, and we're
[07:47] doing the same thing, cold calling
[07:48] people from the phone book to get him to
[07:50] buy stocks. And he never stopped doing
[07:53] that. He still cold calling people out
[07:54] of the phone book. Like, I remember I
[07:56] heard a story where he was on a cruise
[07:58] ship, you know, on vacation once and he
[08:01] heard some old man at the dining room
[08:03] for hours trying to get him to buy his
[08:05] gold cufflings and he wouldn't let the
[08:07] guy go. just like you don't understand
[08:09] these cufflinks because he got bored and
[08:11] he was had cabin fever on this ship in
[08:14] the middle of the Atlantic and he had to
[08:15] sell somebody something. Yeah, Bitcoin
[08:17] is sort of like this vehicle of like
[08:19] free marketing in a way. But we're also
[08:21] seeing that with all these Bitcoin
[08:23] treasury companies. Um there's this
[08:27] concern that all these Bitcoin treasury
[08:29] companies are literally stacking up all
[08:32] the Bitcoin that they can and they're
[08:36] doing it so rapidly and that it could
[08:38] make it easier to see similar to
[08:41] executive order 6102.
[08:44] What makes Bitcoin in this scenario
[08:47] different from gold? All right, you're
[08:49] asking two different questions, right?
[08:50] You're saying what's the risk in these
[08:52] corporate treasury uh plays that micro
[08:55] strategy or strategy pioneer like what
[08:58] where is that going and then you're
[09:00] talking about gold confiscation like
[09:02] okay that's like a separate question so
[09:05] the first question is that
[09:08] the what sailor identified after he
[09:11] identified the melting ice cube which
[09:13] was his basic thesis for bitcoin going
[09:16] back to 2020
[09:18] you know he could have bought it back
[09:19] his own stock.
[09:21] Uh or he could have bought gold with all
[09:24] his cash, you know, but he he he started
[09:26] buying Bitcoin because it was an
[09:28] inflation hedge and it was compounding
[09:31] at a rate that was greater than
[09:32] inflation and he knew that holding cash
[09:34] was a losing strategy and just buying
[09:37] back your own stock. I think that he he
[09:40] figured there had to be something better
[09:42] than that because up until Michael
[09:44] Sailor pretty much the only thing these
[09:47] companies did to boost their earnings
[09:49] was buying back their own stuff, right?
[09:51] He introduced something new. I mean,
[09:52] this was really a remarkable achievement
[09:55] and and milestone in corporate finance.
[09:57] Then the next thing he figured out or
[10:01] implemented was that look, you know,
[10:04] I've got the ability to sell at at the
[10:07] market ATM common stock
[10:10] uh with very little regulatory hurdles
[10:14] to jump and immediately buy Bitcoin with
[10:17] that. And my shareholders, they're not
[10:20] going to complain about dilution because
[10:22] ultimately I'm buying Bitcoin. So it's
[10:24] accretion. So dilution equals accretion
[10:27] is something that again sailor kind of I
[10:30] would say he maybe didn't invent that
[10:34] idea but he brought it to a state of
[10:37] something of approaching perfection on
[10:39] the corporate finance side. So now after
[10:43] uh tirelessly pitching this idea to
[10:46] companies around the world you now have
[10:49] the surge of companies doing the sale or
[10:51] play. So what is where is that going to
[10:54] go? Well, it works for as long as these
[10:58] companies are accessing cheap money. You
[11:02] know, that means they're taking on debt.
[11:04] That means they're putting debt on the
[11:05] balance sheet and they're loading up
[11:07] with Bitcoin. But then you have to say,
[11:10] is this yet another credit cycle? Is it
[11:12] like another dot crash in the making? Is
[11:15] it another shitcoin crash? Is it another
[11:17] bond crash like 1993, the stock market
[11:20] crash of 1987, long-term capital
[11:22] management crash? I think 95. And I
[11:25] would say, yeah, it's going to be
[11:26] they're building up a huge amount of
[11:28] unsustainable debt that's going to blow
[11:30] up at some point. I don't see it
[11:33] happening soon, but I I I believe it
[11:36] will lead to the next cycle top in
[11:39] Bitcoin will be corporate treasury over
[11:42] indulgence.
[11:43] Number one. Number two, confiscation by
[11:46] the government of Bitcoin. Uh if I were
[11:50] the government, I could do that very
[11:51] easily by A
[11:54] uh seizing Coinbase, which is the
[11:56] custodian for all these companies, or B
[11:59] seizing Marathon Mining and Riot Mining
[12:02] in Texas, which they have a shitload of
[12:04] Bitcoin and all the mining capacity. I
[12:08] would that's how I would do it if I were
[12:09] the government. How is Bitcoin going to
[12:11] remain decentralized if a large
[12:14] percentage of Bitcoin is going to be
[12:16] sort of like divided by few individuals
[12:18] and companies? Well, I mean the the
[12:20] decentralization means essentially that
[12:23] no single entity has dominion over the
[12:27] network.
[12:29] So Michael Sailor can't change the
[12:30] protocol. You can own a million Bitcoin.
[12:34] uh you could have two players owning
[12:36] very large positions and even even if
[12:39] they colluded even if they work together
[12:42] they're not going to change the
[12:44] protocol. Is it a possibility to
[12:48] centralize Bitcoin mining by um sort of
[12:51] like having all like more percentage of
[12:55] the power that is
[12:58] increasingly outside the realm of
[13:00] possibility because you have game theory
[13:03] where it's tough to get people to
[13:05] coordinate this type of thing and
[13:07] invalidate their own coins by attacking
[13:10] themselves. 51% attack. In the case of
[13:14] Bitcoin, there are um
[13:18] remedies, but I think ultimately
[13:21] when you discuss every single
[13:24] possibility under the sun that could
[13:26] happen to the protocol in terms of risk,
[13:30] it does come down to one basic idea,
[13:34] which is faith. The Bitcoin protocol
[13:36] gives humanity faith that it will
[13:40] survive, and I think that's it. saving
[13:42] grace. There is something to say about
[13:47] the need for our species
[13:52] to hope and have faith that we will rise
[13:57] above
[13:59] this
[14:01] hell of fiat money. Recently, you
[14:04] mentioned that
[14:07] um we're heading towards $850,000
[14:10] big. Yeah. what dominoes need to happen
[14:13] or fall in order for that to happen.
[14:16] Looking at the global financial picture
[14:20] in how Bitcoin gets to 800,000 and
[14:24] above, there is one piece of data that
[14:28] is at the lynch pen of the entire global
[14:31] financial system. There's one number
[14:35] that tells you like an EKG machine
[14:40] what
[14:40] the health of the global economy is at.
[14:43] Do you know what that number is? I do
[14:45] not. It's the
[14:48] rate of interest on the 10-year Japanese
[14:51] bond. And I'll explain. Yeah. Why?
[14:55] So going all the way back to the Reagan
[14:58] era of the 1980s,
[15:01] the world became financialized, the
[15:04] Reagan Thatcher era of deregulation and
[15:08] we went from a manufacturing society
[15:13] to one of banks and financeers and
[15:17] structured finance and on corporate
[15:21] balance sheets deriving a large
[15:23] percentage of profits from doing trading
[15:26] activities on Wall Street. So the
[15:28] biggest companies in the world, they
[15:30] make a lot of money just by trading with
[15:32] Wall Street. So a car company will make
[15:34] a lot of money on Wall Street just
[15:36] training financial instruments or
[15:38] restaurant company. You become
[15:40] financialized and the best and the
[15:42] brightest became financeers and quants
[15:44] and hedge fund managers. And that's the
[15:46] era of finance. And what drives finance
[15:49] ultimately is cheap money. how how
[15:51] cheaply can I borrow my money to create
[15:54] my structured product, my derivative
[15:58] that's going to help me put cash to the
[16:00] bottom line of whatever enterprise I'm
[16:02] involved with. And for years, for
[16:04] decades, the cheapest place to get money
[16:07] has been Japan. Because after World War
[16:10] II, they had a very structured pension
[16:12] system that accumulated trillions of yen
[16:16] in a a honeypot of cash. That was a
[16:20] go-to cheap place for them to get money
[16:23] to fund their economy. They open that up
[16:26] to global financeers who can then borrow
[16:29] and yen, which is like onetenth of 1%
[16:34] and put that immediately let's say into
[16:36] a US dollar equivalent and get four or
[16:38] five% on that money by simply carrying
[16:43] the cash from yen to dollars became
[16:46] known as the yen carry trade. So what's
[16:49] been happening in the last two years is
[16:50] that the yen carry trade is breaking
[16:53] down and interest rates are going up. So
[16:56] the 10-year Treasury in Japan has never
[16:59] been higher. It's like three and a
[17:00] half%. And it's it's at a precipice now
[17:03] where if it gets much higher, the
[17:05] Japanese economy is going to have to
[17:07] start selling US Treasury bonds to stay
[17:09] solid, which would create a cascading
[17:12] event, what I call the bond apocalypse,
[17:14] where the global bond market crashes.
[17:17] And that's a two to300 trillion dollar
[17:19] market, which is the one of the biggest
[17:21] markets in the world, second only to the
[17:23] forex market. In that environment,
[17:25] Bitcoin spikes to 500,000, 600,000,
[17:30] $800,000 a coin as its safe haven as
[17:34] capital flees the collapsing global bond
[17:38] market due to the unwinding of the
[17:40] global Ponzi scheme or carry trade. And
[17:42] we see it every day. He can track it by
[17:45] just looking at the 10-year Japanese
[17:47] government bond to see where we are, how
[17:49] close we are to the tipping point where
[17:53] the entire global economy goes into
[17:55] freef fall and Bitcoin spikes toward a
[17:58] billion. If this is a truly global
[18:01] financial reset, what dies first? The
[18:05] dollar, the bond market, or trust in
[18:10] governments? Okay, what dies first?
[18:13] Well, you'd have to say confidence or
[18:16] trust dies first in the government in
[18:19] the market. So markets are run on
[18:24] confidence. People buy a stock today at
[18:27] 20 times projected next year's earnings
[18:31] because they have confidence that Nvidia
[18:33] is going to make that number. People buy
[18:36] a US Treasury bond at four or five
[18:38] percent because they have confidence
[18:40] that the US Treasury can pay that
[18:42] interest in it five years, 10 years, 20
[18:45] years. You need confidence to run the
[18:48] capitalist economy. And if that dies and
[18:52] then the next would be the dollar. If
[18:54] confidence the next to die would be the
[18:56] dollar, the US dollar. If if confidence
[18:58] dies in the US and US dollar the ability
[19:04] to not
[19:06] be printed to death, which is on the
[19:09] verge of being printed to death, then
[19:11] inflation will uh spike higher, which
[19:15] kills the bond market. If you're stuck
[19:17] spending dollars, at least stop earning
[19:20] fiat rewards. Use Fold and earn Bitcoin
[19:23] on everyday spending, groceries, travel,
[19:26] even paying bills and take advantage of
[19:30] Bitcoin rewards with merchants you might
[19:32] already shop with. It's the easiest way
[19:35] to stack apps. So, if you're in the
[19:37] United States and you don't have Fold
[19:40] yet, what are you doing? Buy, earn, and
[19:43] save in Bitcoin all in one app. Fold is
[19:46] the ultimate toolkit for making Bitcoin
[19:49] savings a daily habit. So you've also in
[19:52] the past called Bitcoin like this
[19:53] spiritual shift as much as a financial
[19:56] coin. Yes. What happens to a person or
[19:58] to a country when they fully embrace it?
[20:02] What I call the Bitcoin singularity is
[20:04] when we all enter Bitcoin consciousness.
[20:08] And the Bitcoin consciousness is when my
[20:11] Satoshi's and your Satoshi's can be
[20:14] exchanged between us telepathically.
[20:17] And then all of your Satoshi's become my
[20:19] Satoshi's and all of my Satoshi's become
[20:21] your Satoshi's. And we are in one being
[20:24] of the high mind. And I can send you
[20:27] Satoshi's telepathically. And I can just
[20:29] look at you and just send you a million
[20:31] Satoshi's. And you can be like, "Thank
[20:33] you." You can send me 800,000 back.
[20:36] Thank you. And that and that constant
[20:40] murmuration like starlings in the sky
[20:43] flying through the digital space of
[20:46] Bitcoin and perfect money is when we
[20:48] enter the kingdom of Bitcoin and we
[20:50] become one with Satoshi and we see the
[20:53] face of Satoshi and then we dissolve as
[20:57] egodriven
[20:58] monkeys taking acid and we become pure
[21:02] spirit. And one of the things that I
[21:04] also want to touch on is recently you
[21:06] did a podcast and you're talking about
[21:08] the Satoshi generation. Yes. So we're
[21:11] coming to a sense where like for example
[21:14] someone that was born in ' 08 or '09
[21:18] when Bitcoin was first, you know, talked
[21:21] about. They're 16 years old now. They're
[21:24] growing up with Bitcoin. And the price
[21:27] of Bitcoin, it's not obviously what it
[21:29] was back in the day. How can someone
[21:31] that is now, for example, starting out,
[21:34] hasn't even like worked a day in their
[21:36] life, start accumulating Bitcoin in a
[21:38] way that won't be so intimidating. I was
[21:42] uh speaking at the having party in um El
[21:45] Salvador and a 9-year-old kid came up to
[21:48] me on stage and with a similar question
[21:52] like, "I'm 9 years old. Am I too late
[21:55] for Bitcoin?" And I said after thinking
[21:58] about it for a moment, actually I'm too
[22:01] early. What I mean by that is in 20
[22:04] years time when he's 29, he'll be living
[22:07] in a Bitcoin world and everything that
[22:10] comes with living in a Bitcoin world,
[22:12] I'll be gone. What would you say is like
[22:14] the biggest obstacle or challenge in uh
[22:18] that Bitcoin faces in the path to
[22:21] becoming a global reserve currency?
[22:23] Fear. Fear. Fear of everything that
[22:26] we've been talking about. Fear of love
[22:29] and everything can be divided between
[22:31] fear and love. Those are the two paths
[22:34] only two paths available to anybody at
[22:36] any moment. Bitcoin is a path to love.
[22:39] Fiat money is a path to fear. Everyone
[22:42] who's against Bitcoin is fearful, full
[22:44] of fear that there'll be something will
[22:46] be taken away from them, that they'll
[22:48] lose power, that their uh understanding
[22:53] of how the world works might get
[22:54] crushed. That that has happened many
[22:56] times to people, high-profile economists
[22:59] who fear having their worldview crushed
[23:01] by this new asset class, this new
[23:03] reality, this new state of
[23:04] consciousness, Bitcoin, and they act
[23:07] out. They become vengeful. They become
[23:09] hateful. they become um nasty and then
[23:13] they disappear because their their view
[23:16] can't survive. And my last question
[23:18] would be what is your hottest take on
[23:21] Bitcoin?
[23:24] Well, my hottest take on Bitcoin is that
[23:25] it's sent by God to unfuck our money,
[23:28] right? So God sent his son, we killed
[23:31] him and he's like, "I'll give you one
[23:33] more chance. I'll send Bitcoin. If this
[23:35] doesn't unfuck you, then there's no hope
[23:37] for you and you're all gone. It is flash
[23:41] done. Never to be heard from again. This
[23:43] is our last chance. Our last chance to
[23:47] to survive.
[23:49] Awesome. Thank you so much, Max.
[23:52] Awesome.
