[00:00] Uh my name is Trey Sers. I am VP of
[00:02] sales at Unchained. Uh I'm an adviser at
[00:05] Cantaliever and I write a little
[00:07] newsletter called Fire BTC which aims to
[00:11] help Bitcoiners understand how to um put
[00:14] a plan around a path toward financial
[00:17] independence and helps fire
[00:19] practitioners, which we'll get into what
[00:21] that is, uh to understand Bitcoin a
[00:23] little bit better. And that's exactly
[00:25] what we're going to try to do here
[00:26] today. We've got a great panel. Uh some
[00:29] friends of mine here, Jim, Brian, and
[00:31] Morgan. And uh let's let's just get into
[00:33] it. Brian, let's start with you. Um
[00:36] let's get into the basics. What is FIRE?
[00:39] Yeah. So, my name is Brian. I do
[00:41] business development at Fold. I also
[00:42] talk about Bitcoin personal finance on
[00:44] YouTube. I have to say happy birthday to
[00:46] Riot Harrington that turned four this
[00:48] morning. Uh on YouTube.
[00:52] Fire means financial independence.
[00:54] Retire early. And I don't I don't
[00:56] formally identify as part of the
[00:58] movement, but I do formally identify as
[00:59] someone who just binge watches finance
[01:01] content on YouTube all the time. And so
[01:04] I have a lot of thoughts about how
[01:06] Bitcoin can cross over into mainstream
[01:08] personal finance, you know, on YouTube.
[01:11] Yeah. So expand on that a little bit,
[01:14] right? Like what can Bitcoiners
[01:17] understand about the FIRE movement? Like
[01:18] what do they need to know? Yeah. So I
[01:20] think Bitcoiners need to understand that
[01:21] the two movements are actually more
[01:23] aligned than they're not aligned. And so
[01:24] if you're talking to a fire person or
[01:26] talking to a mainstream personal finance
[01:27] person again whether like Morgan and Jim
[01:29] here like like formally advisers like
[01:32] when you're talking to mainstream people
[01:34] meet them where they're at and say like
[01:35] Bitcoin's already in your movement. It's
[01:37] already in your spreadsheet. Like the
[01:38] Bitcoin ETFs were the most successful
[01:40] ETFs in the history of ETFs. Companies
[01:42] in your index funds are already holding
[01:44] Bitcoin. So welcome to the movement.
[01:46] Like you're here already and it just
[01:48] it's the same. I think it's blended and
[01:50] Bitcoiners need to understand that.
[01:51] Yeah. I always think about the
[01:53] intentionality that the FIRE movement
[01:55] puts towards personal finance um and the
[01:59] intentionality that Bitcoiners are
[02:01] putting towards stacking SATs and
[02:03] there's so much overlap between that
[02:04] that mentality that long-term view that
[02:07] low time preference. Jim, you you talk a
[02:10] lot about being intentional. It's the
[02:13] name of your company, right? Intentional
[02:15] uh intentional living, right? Um where
[02:18] do you see this overlap? How can the
[02:21] FIRE movement think about bringing
[02:23] Bitcoin in?
[02:25] Uh I well real quick to the FIRE
[02:28] movement. So again, financial
[02:29] independence, retire early. One of my
[02:32] qualms with that is what I what I see is
[02:35] a lot of people will uh pursue early
[02:38] financial freedom to the detriment of
[02:41] doing things that are important to them
[02:42] today. And I'm not saying just go and
[02:44] blow all your cash for no reason, but
[02:46] it's taking inventory truly what's
[02:48] important to me. That requires you going
[02:49] beyond like what goals I have like oh I
[02:51] want to retire at 48 and get a beach
[02:54] house. It's like okay well why do you
[02:55] want that? It's like oh well I it's not
[02:57] retirement you're after. It's you want
[02:59] more time with your family to spend time
[03:01] with the people you care about you love
[03:03] to pursue passions that are really
[03:04] important to you. Um you want a beach
[03:06] house not because you want a place you
[03:08] have to another place to maintain. You
[03:09] want a place you can uh curate memories
[03:12] with the people you care about. Like so
[03:14] you have to go past those goals. And I I
[03:16] think a lot of people who pursue fire,
[03:18] they're start they they stop at I want
[03:20] to retire at 35. And I'm afraid a lot of
[03:24] these people will get to 35 and they'll
[03:25] be financially free and then they'll go
[03:27] backpack in Indonesia and they'll be
[03:29] there for 3 weeks and realize that they
[03:30] don't have any community and they don't
[03:33] know what they're going to do for the
[03:34] next 45 years of their life. And that's
[03:36] sad. Uh I'd rather see people again
[03:39] being intentional with uh what is truly
[03:41] important to me and how do I align my
[03:43] resources with that? My time, my money,
[03:45] my relationships, my business, my job,
[03:47] those sorts of things. Now, Bitcoin can
[03:49] align deeply with that because if you
[03:51] have a money that is appreciating in
[03:55] purchasing power versus depreciating,
[03:57] you're going to be a lot more cognizant
[03:58] of the opportunity cost of do I spend
[04:01] this now or do I wait till later on? And
[04:03] there's times that, yeah, you probably
[04:05] should wait, but there's also times it's
[04:06] like, you know, this thing is important
[04:07] to me. My kids will not be in my house
[04:09] forever, so therefore I'm going to go
[04:11] ahead and make this memory with them
[04:12] today versus putting it off until
[04:14] they're old. And it's like, all right,
[04:16] kids, now we can go to the beach. It's
[04:17] like, dad, I'm 27 and you were meeting
[04:19] me my whole life. Um, so yeah, really
[04:22] taking inventory. What What do you
[04:23] value? And I think Bitcoin incentivizes
[04:25] that. I mean, you're just coming out
[04:27] firing at the fire people like right off
[04:30] the bat. I was I was looking for some
[04:31] some common ground here. You know, this
[04:34] is a friendly a friendly environment for
[04:36] the fire people. We want them in the
[04:37] movement, right? Um Morgan, you've been
[04:40] pretty critical of fire. I think in a
[04:42] similar in a similar line of thought
[04:46] most critical. Um so just just get into
[04:49] it. Okay. So so first for for the
[04:51] audience, there's an influencer out
[04:53] there goes by the name of Mr. Money
[04:55] Mustache. Yes. And back in 2018, he
[04:58] wrote uh why Bitcoin is stupid and it's
[05:01] all the same FUD and all that kind of
[05:02] thing. Um and so, you know, when I
[05:04] kicked off my newsletter, that was the
[05:06] title of the the first the first
[05:08] newsletter that uh issue that I wrote.
[05:10] Um help us understand what is this
[05:12] mentality? Why are you critical of fire
[05:14] and what are the fire influencers like
[05:16] Mr. Money Mustache or Ramit Seti? What
[05:18] are they getting wrong? I love that
[05:21] question. So I want to start with FIRE
[05:23] stands for financial independence retire
[05:26] early. I have no issues with financial
[05:28] independence, right? I'm a financial
[05:30] adviser. I run a registered investment
[05:32] advisory company. I help people become
[05:33] financially independent. I help people
[05:35] who are financially independent continue
[05:37] to be financially independent. So I have
[05:39] no issues with that part. It's the RE
[05:41] part that really gets me. Uh, and like
[05:44] Jim was saying, if you're just going to
[05:46] sit on a beach and consume the money
[05:48] that you've saved for the past 20 years
[05:50] or whatever it was before you retired
[05:52] early, are you a contributor to society?
[05:54] Are you doing anything to impact society
[05:56] and to make the world a better place? Or
[05:58] are you simply a consumer? And as
[06:00] Bitcoiners, we don't like to be
[06:02] consumers, right? We like to have
[06:04] long-term savings technology in our
[06:05] pocket. We like to contribute to
[06:07] society. We like to make the world a
[06:09] better place. We focus on fixing the
[06:12] money to fix the world and it just does
[06:14] not align with fire. So that's the first
[06:18] part that fire gets wrong is retire
[06:20] early. Simply don't retire early. Right?
[06:22] Find a passion that you love that you
[06:25] can include in your life that you can
[06:27] make money from and that you can become
[06:30] so that you can make the world a better
[06:31] place. Don't just sit on the beach
[06:33] consuming things. And you know what? If
[06:35] that means though that you have to save
[06:37] some money so you can use some of that
[06:39] money to take a lower paying job or help
[06:41] your community in some way, right? You
[06:43] can make an impact without stopping
[06:44] doing work. In fact, work is a blessing
[06:47] and people should see it that way. And
[06:49] if your job is not something that you
[06:50] love, find something in that job that
[06:53] you love until you're able to go find
[06:55] something else. So that's the first
[06:56] thing that they get wrong. The second
[06:57] thing that they get wrong is just that
[06:58] they don't like Bitcoin in general. And
[07:00] so the problem with that is that they're
[07:02] going to be poor eventually, right? I
[07:05] mean, effectively, they're spending all
[07:07] this time meticulously counting all
[07:09] their pennies and their nickels and
[07:10] everything else that they have only to
[07:12] realize that the monetary system is
[07:14] changing and they don't even owe the
[07:15] right money. I mean, for God's sakes,
[07:17] it's not a speculative asset anymore.
[07:20] This is the balance sheet asset. And so
[07:23] if you're going to get that part wrong,
[07:25] you're going to be financially
[07:26] independent for what, 5 years, 10 years,
[07:29] 15 at most. And you're certainly not
[07:31] going to be retired early. And so I
[07:33] encourage the people in the FIRE
[07:35] movement to see what's going on in
[07:36] Bitcoin because it's truly going to be
[07:38] changing how they look at what they're
[07:40] doing.
[07:43] [Music]
[08:11] Well said. I I think people come to the
[08:14] FIRE movement, they see um inspiration
[08:17] in it because like the fiat world and
[08:19] like corporate America is uh kind of
[08:22] soul sucking at times, right? And so
[08:24] people are looking for an escape from
[08:25] that and they find this path of um
[08:30] creating an intentional plan that can be
[08:33] followed and it does work or at least it
[08:35] has worked over the past hundred years
[08:37] or or whatever. Um, and so it can work
[08:39] there. But you're right, there are some
[08:41] risks I think that are not being taken
[08:43] into account from the fire practitioners
[08:46] and certainly that the the fire
[08:47] influencers are not uh not harping on,
[08:50] right? Um, Jim, I think you have an
[08:53] opinion on index funds, which is kind of
[08:55] the primary savings vehicle that most of
[08:57] these fire practitioners really go
[09:00] after. Um, you're you're saving as much
[09:02] as you can. you're plowing them into VTI
[09:05] or VTSAX or some broad market-based
[09:09] index fund that's in the US. Um, what's
[09:12] the risk there that that people are not
[09:14] actually thinking about, especially as
[09:15] we move into more of a Bitcoinized
[09:17] world? Uh, well, one of the issues with
[09:22] index funds, and
[09:24] they're not evil in themselves. The
[09:26] problem is because our base money is
[09:28] broken, we're forced to invest. So, we
[09:32] have essentially taken what's supposed
[09:34] to be an investment vehicle and use that
[09:36] now as a savings vehicle. And that's not
[09:37] how things should be. We should be able
[09:38] to just save our money as money and
[09:41] assume and know that it'll be there in
[09:42] the future with our ex at least our
[09:44] existing purchasing power if not more.
[09:46] Um, now I think a a factor that's not
[09:50] considered from most people in FIRE with
[09:53] index funds also real estate, I don't
[09:55] know, other things, car washes, stuff,
[09:57] it's the same stuff. They always talk
[09:58] about the same thing. So mostly index
[10:00] funds and real estate is the if Bitcoin
[10:03] does what I and I'm assuming you think
[10:05] it will do is it should lead to the
[10:07] demonetization of assets. And so if we
[10:11] have X amount of value in real estate,
[10:14] gold, index funds,
[10:17] collectibles
[10:19] and if Bitcoin goes up in real terms,
[10:22] then that has to go up to the detriment
[10:23] of these other assets. Now, of course,
[10:25] they can all go up in nominal terms, but
[10:27] if in real if assuming the if the money
[10:29] printer stopped and Bitcoin went up,
[10:32] that had to do so to the assets of other
[10:34] things, the amount of value in other
[10:36] assets going down. Again, they can all
[10:38] go up in nominal terms, but in real
[10:39] terms. So, I think that they're they're
[10:41] not considering this of all right, if
[10:42] Bitcoin does this, the value escaping
[10:44] the assets they have all their their net
[10:45] worth in will go down in real purchasing
[10:47] power terms. I did some math I don't
[10:50] know a while back and in my opinion if
[10:53] Bitcoin does what we think it will at
[10:54] that point it was about 4% of your
[10:56] portfolio would retain its existing
[10:57] purchasing power if you had it in
[10:58] Bitcoin. So if you had all these other
[11:00] assets and diversified portfolio and you
[11:01] had 4% in Bitcoin Bitcoin does what we
[11:04] think it will your your real uh
[11:06] purchasing power would stay flat. I
[11:08] would assume that I' I've run the
[11:09] numbers lately but I would assume that's
[11:11] probably crept up a little bit but I
[11:13] think that's that's not considered um
[11:15] and that's that is a risk.
[11:18] So, as part of this like accumulation
[11:21] phase, then certainly should be holding
[11:24] some Bitcoin. I think most FIRE
[11:27] practitioners are maybe not quite there
[11:28] and they're being told the wrong things
[11:30] from their their influencers that
[11:31] they're following. How, Brian, do you
[11:33] think about like building your portfolio
[11:37] or your asset base as you are growing
[11:40] either as a Bitcoiner or as a fire
[11:42] practitioner who's who's maybe
[11:43] interested in Bitcoin? Yeah. So, I agree
[11:45] with all the points made about mistakes
[11:47] that FIRE influencers are making in
[11:49] regard to Bitcoin. Um, I also believe
[11:52] that Bitcoin influencers are making the
[11:54] same mistake back at the FIRE movement.
[11:55] And I think a big part of that is the
[11:58] the boiled down sentences of like never
[12:00] sell is just not it doesn't translate.
[12:03] Like you can't be like, oh, our
[12:05] mainstream Bitcoin influencers the main
[12:07] piece of Bitcoin personal finance advice
[12:09] they hear boiled down is never sell. But
[12:11] then at the same time, we're telling
[12:12] them that it's demonetizing everything
[12:14] and becoming the world reserve currency.
[12:16] Like those two things are not congruent.
[12:17] So we can't be frustrated that like
[12:20] regular mainstream highinccome W2 people
[12:23] that are looking for personal finance
[12:25] advice out there are like considering
[12:27] Bitcoin a nonissue when we aren't giving
[12:29] real personal finance advice, which is
[12:31] why I think this panel is like really
[12:33] important. I appreciate everyone um
[12:34] being here today. And so I don't I don't
[12:37] partake in the kind of philosophy that
[12:40] there is like an accumulation phase of
[12:42] Bitcoin or a spending phase of Bitcoin.
[12:44] Like that's part of what I actually
[12:45] killed like over the first last few
[12:47] years. And so I just truly believe that
[12:49] like holding Bitcoin is positive like
[12:52] positive EV. Like your odds of holding
[12:54] it every single day are positive
[12:56] compared to holding dollars. It's better
[12:58] for the short term and the long term.
[13:00] And so if you can manage that in your
[13:01] own life and have your own like personal
[13:03] finance spin on that, I think it's I
[13:05] think it's better. And then just one
[13:06] final point to the 4% thing, I think
[13:08] that's really interesting. And I I don't
[13:10] I had this argument with another Bitcoin
[13:12] influencer on YouTube. I don't think
[13:14] people that hold other assets like these
[13:16] FIRE people are going to like quote
[13:17] unquote lose. I think Bitcoin's going to
[13:19] backdoor its way into their asset
[13:21] already. like the balance the companies
[13:24] are inside the index funds are going to
[13:26] hit 4% which is giving them the 4% and
[13:29] they're they're going to catch this like
[13:31] escalator up and so I don't think it's
[13:33] like Bitcoin people win other asset
[13:36] holders lose I don't think that well
[13:38] they'll underperform Bitcoin for sure
[13:42] maybe but uh human brains are really
[13:45] good at just like rationaliz like
[13:47] they're never going to say that like
[13:49] they're not going to spike the football
[13:51] and say that and so it's it's better
[13:54] like I don't know I don't think so I I
[13:57] heard advocacy for getting on zero
[14:00] dollars from you right because you're
[14:02] saying that every single day Bitcoin
[14:04] goes up there's a positive EV there
[14:07] expected value uh you should you should
[14:09] hold 100% of your assets in Bitcoin is
[14:11] that or the message is you can do that
[14:14] like tools like Fold are getting better
[14:15] and better every single day that you can
[14:17] do that so the message to Bitcoin people
[14:19] is like like put your money where your
[14:22] mouth is and live out Bitcoin personal
[14:25] finance. Like take it to the next level.
[14:26] If you have like a long-term bucket,
[14:28] short-term bucket, like you're Bitcoin
[14:30] should be taking up more and more a
[14:32] portion of your personal finances at the
[14:35] same time that traditional FIRE people
[14:38] are increasing their allocation as well.
[14:40] Like that's that's literally Bitcoin
[14:42] replacing fiat money in real time.
[14:46] Okay. So, but eventually you have to
[14:48] live off of this value that you've
[14:50] acred, right, Morgan? How do you feel
[14:52] about yield and interest and MSTY and
[14:59] all these other products that are out
[15:00] there? Um, I I think the traditional
[15:02] FIRE approach is really just you build
[15:04] this big stack of VTI and then you sell
[15:06] it down over time. They're not really
[15:08] thinking about like borrowing against
[15:09] their stocks, are they? Everyone wants
[15:12] their divvies, right?
[15:14] Um, so here's the thing. There are many
[15:17] ways to create income. And the biggest
[15:20] myth I would say in both the Bitcoin
[15:22] community and the FIRE community and
[15:24] really in tra traditional finance
[15:25] community is that the only way to create
[15:27] income is through some sort of yield
[15:29] stream. And yes, that is one way to
[15:32] create income, right? One way is to earn
[15:34] income. One way is to get some sort of
[15:35] passive income. And we can debate about
[15:37] what is passive and what is not. And the
[15:39] third thing is actually capital gains.
[15:41] You can create income through capital
[15:43] gains. And in fact, it sometimes
[15:45] depending on your income level, you can
[15:47] even create income through capital gains
[15:48] at a at a much preferential tax
[15:50] treatment. And so like the idea that you
[15:52] have to have yield in order to have
[15:54] income is such a fallacy in in all the
[15:57] communities, especially in the FIRE
[15:59] community where I what I've heard
[16:00] specifically about index funds as well,
[16:02] you know, I have my stock and my bond
[16:04] portfolio. my bond portfolio yields
[16:05] something so I get my income from there
[16:07] and then I have my dividends that I get
[16:09] from like the S&P 500 thing that I hold
[16:11] you know and therefore like you know
[16:12] Bitcoin doesn't have a cash flow so why
[16:14] would I hold that and the reality is
[16:16] that no if Bitcoin goes up in value
[16:18] right you can sell a little bit of that
[16:20] Bitcoin you can take capital gains and
[16:22] there you go you have income so right if
[16:25] money is coming in it's income and
[16:27] people don't like to hear that because
[16:28] selling is really really hard and I
[16:30] totally I totally get that so that part
[16:32] of that is wrong whether or not though
[16:34] you use some of these products, right,
[16:35] is is another story. So MSTY is one of
[16:38] these interesting things because it's an
[16:40] option strategy based on like the um the
[16:42] implied volatility of MSTR. And so like
[16:46] the implied volatility when it's very
[16:47] very high actually the yield is coming
[16:50] from the options in which case right
[16:52] it's not like made up out of thin air
[16:54] like Celsius and BlockFi and all these
[16:56] other places. It's not like if you don't
[16:57] know where the yield is coming from you
[16:59] are the yield. However, if implied
[17:01] volatility comes down, then all of a
[17:02] sudden those divvy checks come crashing
[17:04] down. And so, if all of a sudden you've
[17:05] decided to trade your Bitcoin, a the
[17:07] hardest asset in the world for MSTY,
[17:10] which is going to drift downwards just
[17:12] by design of what it is from the roll
[17:14] yield and the trading cost and the na
[17:16] and the and the fee, right? Then you're
[17:18] basically holding an asset that is going
[17:20] to trend to zero and you're trading that
[17:22] for dividends, right? And so there's a
[17:24] place maybe for that in your portfolio,
[17:26] but it certainly should not be right the
[17:29] asset that you hold. Um, and again, this
[17:31] is not investment advice. I am a
[17:32] registered investment advisor, so I'm
[17:33] not telling anybody to buy to buy MSTY.
[17:35] I'm just giving you commentary on what
[17:37] this thing is. Um, and so I think that
[17:38] that that's just something that the
[17:40] community in general needs to be a
[17:41] little bit more educated on um about
[17:43] learning how to how to incorporate
[17:44] income into your portfolio in a way
[17:46] that's manageable and sustainable and
[17:48] also just doesn't it that it you don't
[17:50] put your balance sheet at risk. What do
[17:52] you think about real estate? Because
[17:54] real estate is kind of maybe the
[17:55] secondary asset of choice in the fire
[17:58] community. Um, maybe there are better
[18:01] tax advantages to owning real estate and
[18:03] and that kind of thing. Brian, I know
[18:04] you are kind of a real estate maxi. I'm
[18:07] going to cut you off. There is a second
[18:08] best. There is a second best. There is
[18:10] not a second best.
[18:13] Um, so real estate, so it's a business.
[18:16] I feel like I often hear from people,
[18:18] oh, I'll just buy some real estate and
[18:19] I'll get this passive income and I won't
[18:20] have to do anything. I'll just get some,
[18:22] you know, some tenants in there. No,
[18:23] like you actually have to run a
[18:24] business, right? If you want to run a
[18:26] rental business, then treat it as such.
[18:28] It is not passive income, right? It may
[18:30] be treated differently on your taxes,
[18:31] right? There may be some deductions that
[18:33] you can take and depending on your
[18:34] income, it might even it might be
[18:35] worthwhile, right? But that's that's not
[18:37] a reason to buy something, right? We
[18:38] don't let the tax like the tax tail wag
[18:41] the dog, right? We want to make good
[18:43] decisions about what makes sense for our
[18:45] life. And if you're buying real estate
[18:46] because you need quote unquote yield,
[18:48] then you should be looking at your whole
[18:50] portfolio and deciding how you're going
[18:52] to create yield from that rather than
[18:53] just throwing yourself into a random
[18:55] business and hoping it works out. The
[18:57] problem The problem with not buying the
[19:00] buildings and not buying the businesses
[19:02] is that if we don't do it, then the fiat
[19:05] maximalists are going to do it. They're
[19:07] going to keep owning every corner store.
[19:09] They're going to keep owning every
[19:11] rental house. And
[19:13] our bucket, the Bitcoin economy should
[19:17] needs to prove needs to prove and grow
[19:19] bigger than the fiat economy in order to
[19:21] fix the world. Like fix the money, fix
[19:23] the world. So, it's a moral issue. You
[19:24] must buy real estate for moral purposes.
[19:26] So many ways to be moral without buying
[19:28] real estate. Brian, I'll I'll say this.
[19:30] So, my wife and I sold our house uh so
[19:34] we can buy more Bitcoin and we have been
[19:35] renting for the last year and a half and
[19:37] like we just had a good new fence. I was
[19:39] like, man, I'm glad I'm not paying for
[19:40] that. So, I would encourage going off of
[19:43] what Morgan was saying, instead of
[19:44] looking like dividends versus these
[19:46] other things, look at total return and
[19:48] volatility. So, you can look at sequence
[19:50] of return risk if you're taking
[19:51] distributions. And that's that's what
[19:53] you should be concerned with. It's not
[19:53] like, oh, where's my dividends coming in
[19:55] versus my income bucket versus this
[19:57] bucket. Look at total returns and how do
[19:58] you create income from that and what's
[20:00] the optimum way? And maybe that means
[20:01] incorporating some real estate. Maybe
[20:03] not. But again, you want to I would
[20:06] encourage looking through that lens and
[20:07] absolutely and so some entrepreneur is
[20:09] providing you and your family that
[20:11] service. We want those entrepreneurs to
[20:13] be Bitcoiners so that that money is
[20:15] flowing into the Bitcoin economy rather
[20:17] than the fiat economy.
[20:19] They're not two different economies
[20:20] though, right? Like we're all living
[20:21] side by side. And so if fiat maxis want
[20:24] to own fiat assets, then we should let
[20:25] them own fiat assets. So, it is except
[20:28] for like someone inside Steak and Shake
[20:30] had to make the decision to flip into a
[20:34] Bitcoin company. There's probably like
[20:35] 10,000 people left in the United States
[20:37] that are in like positions of power in
[20:39] like large businesses or, you know,
[20:41] there's a lot of government panels here
[20:43] and like things like that. And I really
[20:44] think that like there is like being a
[20:47] land owner inside your city does come
[20:49] with influence. Like being a business
[20:51] owner inside your city does come with
[20:53] influence. And the more that people like
[20:55] of influence become Bitcoin maximists
[20:58] instead of fiat maximists, it just it
[21:00] brings it all. It we're pulling the
[21:02] future forward. Okay, we we have to stop
[21:05] with that line because we have just over
[21:07] two minutes. This next one is pretty
[21:09] simple answer though, right? Which is
[21:11] how much Bitcoin do you need to retire?
[21:14] Is that simple? So, okay. So the the
[21:16] traditional fire think the the
[21:18] traditional fire uh mechanism for
[21:21] determining this is something called the
[21:22] 4% rule. Essentially means you need to
[21:24] save up a savings portfolio of 25 times
[21:28] your annual expenses and then you can
[21:29] draw down on that at a 4% rate to cover
[21:32] your your cost of living. Um how do we
[21:35] feel about the 4% rule? Me? Yeah. Does
[21:38] it apply to Bitcoin? So I have I have
[21:42] very mixed feelings about the 4% rule.
[21:43] The 4% rule is based on a 50/50
[21:45] portfolio of stocks and bonds um and was
[21:48] tested over 30-year periods of time. For
[21:50] FIRE community in general, right, most
[21:52] of these people are retiring for 60
[21:54] years. Um if you're retiring on Bitcoin,
[21:56] right, you're very dependent on what the
[21:57] Bitcoin price is relative to dollars
[21:59] currently, right? We're not living on a
[22:01] Bitcoin standard. And therefore, you
[22:02] have to be mindful that every time you
[22:04] spend your Bitcoin, right, you have less
[22:05] in your stack. And so there have been
[22:07] lots of numbers floated around anywhere
[22:09] from, you know, 6% 8% 10% because, you
[22:12] know, Bitcoin's returns have been so
[22:14] high typically. And so if you focus in
[22:16] on, let's say, the 8% number, what
[22:18] happens is that over a really short
[22:20] period of time, uh, you can end up with
[22:22] only 5% of your stack left. And so for
[22:25] most people, right, who have spent so
[22:26] much time and energy and talent working
[22:29] to create these Bitcoin portfolios that
[22:32] they can retire on, right, then
[22:34] basically you end up in a position where
[22:35] you have so much left, like nothing
[22:37] left, right? And so again, I asked the
[22:39] community, what are we intending to do
[22:41] with our money? Is the purpose to be
[22:44] here on earth and to accumulate some
[22:46] money and then die with nothing? or is
[22:49] the purpose to give to your community,
[22:51] provide for your family, create
[22:53] multigenerational wealth, right? You
[22:54] have to look at what your goals are and
[22:56] your goals are ultimately going to
[22:57] determine what the right uh portfolio
[22:59] rate is. And in general, I think they
[23:01] should be much lower with Bitcoin. You
[23:03] should try to protect that stack as much
[23:04] as you can. And if that means yeah, that
[23:06] you have to find a fulfilling job that
[23:07] you can work in for a longer period of
[23:09] time to contribute to society, then I
[23:10] think that that's something that you
[23:11] should do. And so I think that
[23:13] appropriate rates should be relative to
[23:15] your age and that you should be trying
[23:16] to plan out to age 100 because you know
[23:19] with the hope with the help of God right
[23:20] we could live a really long time in the
[23:22] in in the you know the the world that we
[23:24] live in now with all the technology and
[23:25] the medicine advances and so forth. And
[23:27] so for most people that's probably going
[23:28] to be more like a 2% withdrawal rate
[23:30] which people in the Bitcoin community do
[23:32] not like to hear because a lot of people
[23:34] have you know NGU on their mind and
[23:36] they're like well NGU and it went up and
[23:38] now all of a sudden I can flip off my
[23:40] boss and I can go retire and I'll just
[23:42] spend 8 to 10% of my stack and you know
[23:44] that last SAT that I own is going to be
[23:45] worth trillions of dollars so who cares?
[23:48] And I just think that that's a really
[23:49] bad mentality. And also you don't know
[23:50] actually what the world is going to look
[23:52] like when we go from a fiat standard to
[23:55] a Bitcoin standard. Um, and we don't
[23:57] know what inflation is like and what
[23:58] things are going to cost and so forth.
[24:00] And the best way to approach a financial
[24:02] plan is to be more conservative. That
[24:04] sounds very bearish to me. Jim, yes or
[24:06] no? We're we're out of time. Yes or no?
[24:08] 4% rule.
[24:10] No. Okay. Uh, quick last word, shill

[24:17] financial planner. Same all the
[24:19] disclosures, legal, tax. That wasn't
